[00:00.000 --> 00:12.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.360 --> 00:21.120]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.120 --> 00:28.960]  we've got another extremely powerful and important worldwide broadcast lined up
[00:28.960 --> 00:37.920]  for you it is Tuesday the 22nd day of May 2012 I'm gonna open the phones up in
[00:37.920 --> 00:41.880]  the shower and also go over a ton of news I mentioned it yesterday but I didn't
[00:41.880 --> 00:47.440]  have time to play any of it because we had three guests on and we were cutting
[00:47.440 --> 00:53.080]  out all the cuss words but we are going to be able to play some of the excerpts
[00:53.080 --> 00:56.640]  of the teacher that they've now confirmed at first they said it was a
[00:56.640 --> 01:01.200]  conspiracy theory that another teacher recorded this because they said it was
[01:01.200 --> 01:04.520]  abuse that was allowed to go on and they were tired of it but the media said
[01:04.520 --> 01:09.800]  there's no way Obama supporters act like this no one would say you'll be
[01:09.800 --> 01:13.840]  arrested for criticizing Obama and then now it's admitted and the teacher has
[01:13.840 --> 01:19.560]  been suspended and so the media is now saying maybe it is bad to talk about a
[01:19.560 --> 01:23.960]  sitting president well I mean in my film Obama deception I have clips of the
[01:23.960 --> 01:30.360]  news out of Missouri where the police chiefs and prosecutors go on the news
[01:30.360 --> 01:35.480]  and they say if you talk bad about Obama for example say he is not a
[01:35.480 --> 01:43.000]  Christian that is a lie we will arrest you I can play the clip again people
[01:43.000 --> 01:47.200]  don't believe that in fact Watson was digging around for history to add it to
[01:47.200 --> 01:50.640]  his article it's been like three years since I've aired it well you guys call
[01:50.640 --> 01:54.560]  Watson because he's good at ferreting stuff and had him send you there's a
[01:54.560 --> 01:58.960]  Missouri and a Vermont newscast but the Missouri one is the really hard core
[01:58.960 --> 02:03.120]  one where they go prosecutors are standing by to arrest you you did not
[02:03.120 --> 02:09.720]  talk about about the new leader of course he that was whenever he was running
[02:09.720 --> 02:14.400]  for office and a lot of people believe this I mean it's like when cops walk
[02:14.400 --> 02:17.000]  over to you say turn your camera off and you're like a hundred yards away from
[02:17.000 --> 02:20.600]  whatever they're doing at a checkpoint you go but sir I have a first amendment
[02:20.600 --> 02:23.720]  I mean I try to be polite up front they'll say turn it off I told you to
[02:23.720 --> 02:28.440]  and I said I'm not interfering with your activities I'm here observing this
[02:28.440 --> 02:32.440]  First Amendment and then a many times they say alright I'm about to arrest you
[02:32.440 --> 02:37.040]  and I say okay if you have to do that you may even beat the lawsuit because the
[02:37.040 --> 02:40.280]  court is so corrupt you're not gonna beat the ride you need to just leave my
[02:40.280 --> 02:44.080]  first amendment alone don't you have children are you threatening my family
[02:44.080 --> 02:47.960]  this is that repeatedly you know I'm not doing that I'm saying do you want them
[02:47.960 --> 02:52.400]  to grow up in a free society I mean do you really think you can have cameras
[02:52.400 --> 02:55.440]  all over the street corners and a camera in your squad car and say there's no
[02:55.440 --> 03:01.480]  presumption of privacy in public which there isn't one and then tell me I can't
[03:01.480 --> 03:09.080]  have a camera on you I'm not close to what you're doing so stop bucking up to
[03:09.080 --> 03:13.120]  me you really are acting in a shameful fashion I mean I've had those exact
[03:13.120 --> 03:18.480]  conversations like some of them are on video tried to protest Perry once and
[03:18.480 --> 03:22.040]  they had the riot cops getting dressed across street I should listen I don't
[03:22.040 --> 03:25.600]  need to permit the city's lost a bunch of lawsuits over this we're not blocking
[03:25.600 --> 03:30.880]  the road I would need one for that we're not blocking the road or the
[03:30.880 --> 03:35.680]  entrance of this hotel this is a public street we're gonna arrest you and I said
[03:35.680 --> 03:41.200]  man you are such a criminal I said how dare you try to destroy my country like
[03:41.200 --> 03:45.040]  that he said that said I'm gonna have you arrested and then the media was there
[03:45.040 --> 03:48.600]  and I go he just said he's gonna have me arrested the media goes over a local
[03:48.600 --> 03:52.680]  newspaper and said did you just say you'd have him arrested no I did not and
[03:52.680 --> 03:55.960]  that's when I blew up and I shouldn't have I started screaming at him and
[03:55.960 --> 03:59.760]  calling him a scumbag and everything else and lost my composure I mean he was
[03:59.760 --> 04:05.000]  wrong at that point for lying I was wrong at that point for escalating it and
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.000]  getting emotional I just need to learn control it's just that he's sitting there
[04:09.000 --> 04:13.200]  on video there's video this on YouTube and this goes on and on and on him saying
[04:13.200 --> 04:18.040]  he's gonna arrest us and the newspaper comes up versus is that true no I didn't
[04:18.040 --> 04:25.040]  say that it's like wow no wonder you are a captain no wonder you're in charge I
[04:25.040 --> 04:33.320]  mean my goodness my goodness how creepy is that speaking of creepy even CBS news

[08:23.360 --> 08:29.200]  degenerating families are falling apart culture is falling apart all of this has
[08:29.200 --> 08:33.640]  been done by design and police departments that don't fall to corruption
[08:33.640 --> 08:38.520]  are fighting the federal globalist takeover many others have fully succumbed
[08:38.520 --> 08:43.720]  I am seeing footage sent in to us from all over the country police telling
[08:43.720 --> 08:48.200]  people that they can't film them in public and coming over and threatening
[08:48.200 --> 08:55.040]  to beat them I was just sent footage of a cop threatening to rape a man and then
[08:55.040 --> 09:00.800]  moving in to do it in public you know threatening to rape him and then in an
[09:00.800 --> 09:06.840]  acting like he's going to do it I mean it's it's totally profanity-laced no one
[09:06.840 --> 09:10.920]  even has this video yet this just broke we're gonna get this up at info wars
[09:10.920 --> 09:17.080]  dot com in the next 15 minutes or so and again I don't want to just sit here and
[09:17.080 --> 09:21.840]  bash the police because that falls into the globalist program of where then the
[09:21.840 --> 09:26.320]  good people leave the police force and it's an us against the mentality and the
[09:26.320 --> 09:29.960]  police feel like they're being persecuted and it kind of psychologically puts
[09:29.960 --> 09:37.400]  them into a Masada standoff fortress mentality we need to reach out to the
[09:37.400 --> 09:41.680]  people in the bureaucracy and explain to them that where this new world order is
[09:41.680 --> 09:47.520]  going is not a good place for anybody again ladies and gentlemen it is
[09:47.520 --> 09:57.960]  Tuesday the 22nd day of May 2012 and we are going to be live here for the next
[09:57.960 --> 10:03.600]  three hours and we're also going to be opening the phones up on any of the
[10:03.600 --> 10:12.040]  issues I raise or any of the issues that you wish to raise now continuing here
[10:12.040 --> 10:17.400]  today with the news let me just give you a smattering of some of what's coming
[10:17.400 --> 10:24.360]  up a pistoli the head of the TSA says Gropers being trained to feel for the
[10:24.360 --> 10:34.640]  crotch specifically continuing here we'll also get into Facebook IPO CIA and
[10:34.640 --> 10:39.520]  Goldman Sachs take the suckers for a stroll Aaron Dice last week of course
[10:39.520 --> 10:42.840]  reported that it appeared this is going to be a pump and dump with a 100
[10:42.840 --> 10:47.480]  billion in stock and it's already dropped tens of billions and the CIA was
[10:47.480 --> 10:51.720]  involved in setting up Facebook all the evidence is there and it ties into
[10:51.720 --> 10:56.840]  Aaron Dice's prediction of the suckers being taken for a ride because there is
[10:56.840 --> 11:02.000]  no government it is corrupt elements of Wall Street who are using crony insider
[11:02.000 --> 11:08.120]  operations to rob everyone through banker bailouts and insider trading so
[11:08.120 --> 11:11.440]  we're going to be going over that very important report by Curt Nimmo another
[11:11.440 --> 11:17.160]  report on the TSA backlash prompts move away from pat downs but they're always
[11:17.160 --> 11:20.760]  saying that they're going to do things like that like oh we're going to stop
[11:20.760 --> 11:24.800]  groping people under 12 or first we never groped or we never strip search
[11:24.800 --> 11:28.720]  old ladies we never rip off claspy bags we don't take little boy shirts and
[11:28.720 --> 11:32.520]  pants off in public we don't go inside the waistband we don't go inside the
[11:32.520 --> 11:36.040]  pants we don't squeeze your genitals and they all get caught doing and they say
[11:36.040 --> 11:41.680]  oh yeah we do we don't pet you down after you get radiation scans oh actually we
[11:41.680 --> 11:46.880]  do oh there's no radiation from these oh actually we lied there is oh we've
[11:46.880 --> 11:50.320]  had them certified as safe actually they have it and blocked a congressional
[11:50.320 --> 11:53.240]  investigation I don't know how a bureaucracy blocks it but that's just
[11:53.240 --> 11:59.000]  what they do on and on and on a culture of total deception but the backlash is
[11:59.000 --> 12:05.280]  so huge that they're playing possum again saying they're going to stop except in
[12:05.280 --> 12:11.800]  special cases the genital crushing I mean they literally squeeze your genitals
[12:11.800 --> 12:14.720]  to find out what they are and I'm sorry we have to talk about this on air but
[12:14.720 --> 12:19.720]  this is happening to women to men and to children and many women cry many men
[12:19.720 --> 12:25.840]  freak out when they go in the pants it is absolutely horrific a year ago they
[12:25.840 --> 12:29.320]  were actually going in and grabbing in the pants physically with dirty gloves
[12:29.320 --> 12:33.480]  because of lawsuits and things they just now stick it in up to their thumbs
[12:33.480 --> 12:38.040]  that's about five inches with the average hand six inches and just and just
[12:38.040 --> 12:42.720]  palpate the outside of the underwear but if you're not wearing underwear it's
[12:42.720 --> 12:46.720]  over again in the name of someone might have a bomb well why don't have a
[12:46.720 --> 12:50.280]  checkpoint on the highway might be a bomb well they are doing that now might
[12:50.280 --> 12:54.200]  be a bomb in a hotel have checkpoints there might have a bomb in a shopping
[12:54.200 --> 12:59.080]  mall we'll have one there it's ridiculous then you find out the people who
[12:59.080 --> 13:03.960]  are involved in running this whole system are the ones financing the terrorist
[13:03.960 --> 13:08.680]  and protecting them and provocaturing over and over and over and over again
[13:08.680 --> 13:13.760]  the 7-7 bombing leader MI6 on record a SWAT the guy handling the Fort Hood
[13:13.760 --> 13:20.440]  shooter and others known Pentagon double agent source Fox News Associated Press
[13:20.440 --> 13:27.520]  the list goes on and on and on and on and again who stands to gain from all of
[13:27.520 --> 13:31.480]  this the bureaucracy that gets to grow the banksters that want a police state
[13:31.480 --> 13:39.200]  in place okay let's continue here 43 Catholic organizations file lawsuit
[13:39.200 --> 13:42.920]  against Department of Homeland Security and this is more than just saying
[13:42.920 --> 13:48.400]  Catholic churches hospitals charities have to pay for abortions and birth
[13:48.400 --> 13:53.440]  control for people they're also saying you've got to hire people who I mean so
[13:53.440 --> 13:59.320]  I guess the Buddhists have got to hire people that work at slaughterhouses and
[13:59.320 --> 14:08.040]  eat meat no does somebody who's gay have to rent a room out to somebody who is a
[14:08.040 --> 14:13.360]  Baptist preacher and anti-gay no we all have our own rights and the systems
[14:13.360 --> 14:18.120]  trying to get rid of that but but here's the deal with churches Congress shall
[14:18.120 --> 14:23.280]  make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the
[14:23.280 --> 14:28.040]  free exercise thereof there is no jurisdiction or there's no jurisdiction
[14:28.040 --> 14:32.520]  for TSA to be at the airports or on the highways but they're doing it there's
[14:32.520 --> 14:36.320]  no jurisdiction for the federal government to mandate sodium fluoride
[14:36.320 --> 14:38.920]  and hundreds of other deadly chemicals in the water but they do it including
[14:38.920 --> 14:44.920]  radioactive isotopes your new listener I'm not joking look it up reality is so
[14:44.920 --> 14:51.640]  much crazier than anyone can imagine and I can even imagine take America America
[14:51.640 --> 14:54.760]  the freest richest most prosperous country weren't perfect but we were the
[14:54.760 --> 15:00.280]  freest nation out there the system the new world order global social engineers
[15:00.280 --> 15:03.480]  going back 100 years ago Rockefeller Foundation and others we post new
[15:03.480 --> 15:07.520]  documents every day that are coming on the Rockefellers from them they said
[15:07.520 --> 15:12.960]  what do we do we take over medicine we poison the food and water so that people
[15:12.960 --> 15:17.960]  are so dumb down they can't resist us and that's been the problem and so that's
[15:17.960 --> 15:24.440]  how you take the most aggressive smartest freest most powerful nation of
[15:24.440 --> 15:31.480]  trailblazers and swashbucklers and inventors and scientists and ranchers
[15:31.480 --> 15:39.720]  and farmers and you have that whole wagon train mentality the slavery people
[15:39.720 --> 15:44.400]  that came here through adversity the sharecroppers the criminals the
[15:44.400 --> 15:49.360]  political dissidents that made the most powerful country the most amazing
[15:49.360 --> 15:55.120]  country five percent of the population half the world's wealth and now is that
[15:55.120 --> 15:59.320]  wild west liberty goes out the window everything disappears everything starts
[15:59.320 --> 16:04.720]  melting down everything starts falling apart and now they want to come in and
[16:04.720 --> 16:09.320]  say this nation with all those interesting people involved in it but at
[16:09.320 --> 16:15.280]  the core a Christian worth that ethic and a Christian idea to try to keep all
[16:15.280 --> 16:19.760]  that in check and they're telling churches you are going to hire people
[16:19.760 --> 16:25.640]  that aren't Christian and you are going to take that that cross down in the in
[16:25.640 --> 16:28.880]  the town square that's been there 200 years and you're not gonna have a
[16:28.880 --> 16:35.560]  Christmas tree and you're not because because the minority says so no the
[16:35.560 --> 16:38.920]  system wants to be able to tell you what type of white bulbs to have what type of
[16:38.920 --> 16:43.000]  washing machine what type of toilet what type of weather sealant what type of air
[16:43.000 --> 16:49.200]  conditioner what type of meter outside your house what type of Christmas tree

[16:54.760 --> 17:00.360]  winter holidays they are changing the language to set the precedent that
[17:00.360 --> 17:03.960]  government controls language and that's where you get a teacher like this one
[17:03.960 --> 17:09.080]  let's play a few of these Jim quotes this is now gone mega viral Steve Watson
[17:09.080 --> 17:14.160]  and Paul Watson both wrote about this yesterday but this report a teacher
[17:14.160 --> 17:18.720]  yells at students says it's a criminal offense to criticize Obama the media is
[17:18.720 --> 17:26.120]  spinning this like she was mean to him because of what he said but no she was
[17:26.120 --> 17:29.800]  saying it's a criminal to criticize the president well isn't that what the whole
[17:29.800 --> 17:33.920]  system says that's what it is when a cop comes over and says don't aim a camera
[17:33.920 --> 17:37.120]  at me a hundred yards away on a public street or I'm gonna arrest you and they
[17:37.120 --> 17:42.040]  do that's saying don't aim a camera don't cover us don't watch us in Mexico the
[17:42.040 --> 17:46.280]  drug cartels go after the press what do you think is happening here the press
[17:46.280 --> 17:51.840]  is being targeted and look out police because when you knock down the last
[17:51.840 --> 17:55.000]  checks and balances I've got articles where police are now telling people
[17:55.000 --> 18:00.400]  nationwide bring your money in to get your son out of jail for drunk driving
[18:00.400 --> 18:05.320]  or whatever the case is bringing in cash and when the mother gets there or the
[18:05.320 --> 18:09.600]  father with cash they take it on the spot and the police are defending it
[18:09.600 --> 18:12.640]  saying well it could have been drug money and they do this thing where they
[18:12.640 --> 18:18.280]  test the cash and almost all money has some drug residue on it and they
[18:18.280 --> 18:21.720]  claim that's the pretext to take it that's just a group of highway criminals
[18:21.720 --> 18:25.800]  let's go out to break with the teacher and we'll come back with a longer clip
[18:25.800 --> 18:30.880]  here it is as a social studies teacher I cannot allow you to slander any
[18:30.880 --> 18:37.640]  president in here yes ma'am passed or current yes ma'am okay
[18:37.640 --> 18:43.040]  do you know do you realize that people were arrested for saying things bad about
[18:43.040 --> 18:47.920]  Bush it doesn't matter no do you realize you are not you can't you're not
[18:47.920 --> 18:53.480]  supposed to slander I'm not wondering I asked the question but I'm saying I'm saying to you
[18:53.480 --> 18:58.120]  hit pause right there that's what the police said in Missouri back during the
[18:58.120 --> 19:02.120]  last campaign they said if you talk about about the president that is slander
[19:02.120 --> 19:07.120]  we will arrest you know slander is proven in court so is libel and defamation
[19:07.120 --> 19:11.800]  if you say Alex Jones murdered nine children and has them buried in his
[19:11.800 --> 19:16.480]  basement and that's not true that is slander defamation you've you printed
[19:16.480 --> 19:24.640]  it's libel then I can be held civilly responsible okay that is not the case
[19:24.640 --> 19:29.160]  but they preemptively that's what I've been told before you know by people that
[19:29.160 --> 19:31.680]  are told to shut up in colleges you name it they say don't criticize the
[19:31.680 --> 19:35.920]  government don't say the CIA brings drugs in that's slander of the government
[19:35.920 --> 19:38.920]  really I thought that was the first amendment what the founders said see
[19:38.920 --> 19:45.680]  everything I stand for is really simple it's what the founders stood for everything
[19:45.680 --> 19:49.640]  the globalist stand for is 180 degrees against that founding fathers common

[23:57.600 --> 24:00.240]  only one you've got
[24:05.880 --> 24:10.440]  all right I want to get back into the assault on the first amendment here and
[24:10.440 --> 24:15.720]  we're gonna come back and get into some more news and then open the phones up but
[24:15.720 --> 24:19.720]  there's a point I always mean to make on air and it's something that I don't make
[24:19.720 --> 24:23.040]  in fact this is a point I don't think I've really ever made and it's so
[24:23.040 --> 24:27.160]  incredibly central that I'll just announce here I've dropped the ball in
[24:27.160 --> 24:35.560]  a gigantic horrendous way people see the good in society and they see the
[24:35.560 --> 24:40.920]  positive things that are happening and they end up attributing that to the
[24:40.920 --> 24:45.120]  controllers but the controllers at the top are very very sophisticated they
[24:45.120 --> 24:49.120]  put up all these billboards with public service announcements a lot of it
[24:49.120 --> 24:54.200]  reasonable good points but it's done to put the government in the position
[24:54.200 --> 25:00.880]  psychologically as the parent lecturing to you like you're bad and you notice
[25:00.880 --> 25:04.680]  since government in the last 50 60 years has taken on the parent role
[25:04.680 --> 25:09.160]  parents don't act like parents they act like children in fact this the many
[25:09.160 --> 25:13.280]  globalists admit that the state is like a parent the big brother the big mommy the
[25:13.280 --> 25:20.400]  big daddy and I'm getting around to my point here people 50 60 years ago would
[25:20.400 --> 25:24.400]  be insulted by constant messages telling them to do simple common sense
[25:24.400 --> 25:29.360]  things but the system does that so that it looks like it cares about you and
[25:29.360 --> 25:33.040]  people that work for the system kind of buy into there the daddy you're the
[25:33.040 --> 25:38.360]  child sit down and shut up which is completely backwards in the hierarchy
[25:38.360 --> 25:43.760]  it's the people and then the government we are the government so Romans 13
[25:43.760 --> 25:48.440]  submit to the will of the people within the constitutional confines because you
[25:48.440 --> 25:53.000]  can't have a manipulator come to power who you know manipulates 51% to say
[25:53.000 --> 25:59.080]  kill the other 49 now the point I never make is this there are parallels in
[25:59.080 --> 26:04.000]  history of good people working at different levels of knowledge for good
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.880]  and so there are good charities there are good people in government there are
[26:08.880 --> 26:15.400]  good ideas there are good corporations it's not one monolithic system but good
[26:15.400 --> 26:20.600]  is done pretty much in an uncoordinated way whereas the new world order crowd
[26:20.600 --> 26:24.920]  admits they're good at long-term planning see they sell us on short-term
[26:24.920 --> 26:30.840]  planning in quarterly planning while they are really thinking in 25 50 hundred
[26:30.840 --> 26:34.840]  year plans and then we're told oh Western governments are just in a year to
[26:34.840 --> 26:40.440]  year program that's only on the surface in the false political system in which
[26:40.440 --> 26:47.720]  most people reside but it's much deeper and much higher their systems below and
[26:47.720 --> 26:55.080]  above the narrow spectrum that the system tries to keep people in and so you
[26:55.080 --> 26:59.240]  hear that term getting off the reservation getting outside the box that
[26:59.240 --> 27:04.440]  doesn't mean believe everything I'm saying it means simply looking for depth
[27:04.440 --> 27:12.280]  looking for the deeper meanings looking for things in a more complex way and
[27:12.280 --> 27:15.800]  again it sounds like something very simple I'm like this is very profound
[27:15.800 --> 27:20.600]  there are parallels of good well there are parallels of good throughout
[27:20.600 --> 27:25.480]  history and and and so there are competing systems it's not all bad and
[27:25.480 --> 27:30.960]  the globalist aren't in full control they're trying to get full control that's
[27:30.960 --> 27:35.160]  what they want a global government so they don't want any nation to be too
[27:35.160 --> 27:39.560]  powerful that's why they want to deindustrialize the United States it's
[27:39.560 --> 27:44.320]  not because they want to equalize all the nations towards a greater good which
[27:44.320 --> 27:49.080]  wouldn't work historically but but that's what they sell mid-level globalist
[27:49.080 --> 27:52.400]  they actually believe they're doing something good when you get into deeper
[27:52.400 --> 27:56.400]  globalist documents that are public and of late it's really about a post
[27:56.400 --> 28:01.560]  industrial world where the elite are waging war against prosperity and wealth
[28:01.560 --> 28:07.800]  and and intelligence and true renaissance type deep understanding in the
[28:07.800 --> 28:11.800]  population because you can't control people like that they're going to want
[28:11.800 --> 28:14.720]  freedom they're going to want transparency they're going to want
[28:14.720 --> 28:18.320]  liberty they're not going to like bondage they're not going to like seeing
[28:18.320 --> 28:25.800]  people hurt so they try to sell us on being predators and they're trying to
[28:25.800 --> 28:32.000]  twist our will with propaganda and excuses and things to make torture and
[28:32.000 --> 28:35.480]  secret arrest and an overthrow of the Bill of Rights and Constitution looks
[28:35.480 --> 28:42.680]  sexy and the system is also demonizing the Bill of Rights and Constitution and
[28:42.680 --> 28:48.120]  capitalism the system does all this in the name of the Republic in the name of
[28:48.120 --> 28:54.680]  America in the name of capitalism when it's the complete opposite it is a
[28:54.680 --> 29:01.800]  crony fascistic insider monopoly system and then you see Time magazine
[29:01.800 --> 29:06.960]  Newsweek all of them demonizing the Constitution demonizing free market and
[29:06.960 --> 29:11.800]  saying it did this free market gives you incredible choices free market gives
[29:11.800 --> 29:17.040]  you a wide spectrum of jobs free market gives you a chance if you want to even
[29:17.040 --> 29:22.200]  halfway work hard and be charming to be incredibly successful I've studied
[29:22.200 --> 29:26.960]  history you studied history it's common sense look at what communism delivers
[29:26.960 --> 29:34.000]  abject hell on earth except for a tiny one-tenth of 1% who don't even live in
[29:34.000 --> 29:38.360]  that much splendor but they've got power of life and death over people and see
[29:38.360 --> 29:43.000]  the real globalist elites they want the power of life and death they like
[29:43.000 --> 29:47.400]  killing that's what they're looking for you understand there's only so much

[34:31.200 --> 34:34.200]  think we should rally some of the things we should do but there's gonna be a lot
[34:34.200 --> 34:39.360]  of alternative media there it's forced the mainstream media to cover it there
[34:39.360 --> 34:45.840]  was a another Politico article out on Bilderberg today and another in Salon
[34:45.840 --> 34:51.240]  and in fact there's over a hundred articles out in the last two days just in
[34:51.240 --> 34:55.080]  the Google news area if you put in Bilderberg and click Google news it was
[34:55.080 --> 35:01.400]  132 articles this morning I saw in the last last 24 hours so yesterday and this
[35:01.400 --> 35:06.480]  morning I call that two days it's really just 24 hours before you would never
[35:06.480 --> 35:10.600]  see anything like that and so now they're having to go okay it does exist
[35:10.600 --> 35:14.480]  yeah people that end up being presidents secretly meet there what's the big
[35:14.480 --> 35:19.640]  deal yeah they want global government look at this co-calix Jones he's bad
[35:19.640 --> 35:24.720]  because he's right he's bad because he's a trailblazer and so is everybody else
[35:24.720 --> 35:29.720]  like Jim Tucker and all of you out there that took action you're just bad it's
[35:29.720 --> 35:33.840]  terrible what you've done sure open world governments being announced and it's
[35:33.840 --> 35:36.560]  just terrible that you're not going along with that you know the Southern
[35:36.560 --> 35:40.040]  Poverty Law Center and ADL you read their documents there they're a little
[35:40.040 --> 35:47.280]  public intelligence reports they put out my dad gets mailed them other people I
[35:47.280 --> 35:52.440]  know other other quote professionals get these monthly little glossy magazines
[35:52.440 --> 35:57.160]  and it's like look at this crazy guy Alex Jones he believes there's a plan by
[35:57.160 --> 36:01.120]  big banks is up a world government I gotta dig those out I've got those
[36:01.120 --> 36:04.480]  somewhere this is like five six years ago they're putting out reports on us
[36:04.480 --> 36:09.320]  they were doing it 15 years ago but five years ago they did a whole bunch five
[36:09.320 --> 36:13.840]  or six years ago and it's like now they're saying oh these kooks don't like
[36:13.840 --> 36:18.840]  the world government I thought it didn't exist I mean think of all the police
[36:18.840 --> 36:22.120]  out there that have gotten constant training manuals for at least the last
[36:22.120 --> 36:26.720]  20 years saying those that believe in a plan for megabanks to take over the
[36:26.720 --> 36:31.440]  world in the UN to take over control of resources and in education in the US
[36:31.440 --> 36:36.440]  they're crazy dangerous people and if you see a get us out of the UN sticker
[36:36.440 --> 36:41.040]  you'd be advised officers to pull them over immediately you're probably dealing
[36:41.040 --> 36:49.080]  with a terrorist or cop killer and now everything we talked about came true but
[36:49.080 --> 36:52.200]  it's like these terrorists don't like the world government that's here to save
[36:52.200 --> 36:57.080]  everybody I mean everyone remembers the media saying this didn't exist now it
[36:57.080 --> 37:02.160]  exists but you're bad if you don't like it now let me go back to this story and
[37:02.160 --> 37:05.240]  then I'll get let me get the number out right now the toll free number on any of
[37:05.240 --> 37:13.480]  the issues we've been covering is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 and it's a
[37:13.480 --> 37:19.480]  free-for-all as Ted Nugent would say okay continuing here again teacher yells

[37:35.200 --> 37:41.080]  conspiracy that didn't even happen there is no Waco and half the yuppies on
[37:41.080 --> 37:47.080]  floor I would say okay whatever you say boss and you know the teacher said you

[37:51.160 --> 37:56.120]  10-minute video here's some of the excerpts it hasn't been edited except for
[37:56.120 --> 38:02.280]  the cuss words and boy there's plenty of those imagine this is standard public
[38:02.280 --> 38:07.480]  school in America in a city and I see videos like this all the time and they
[38:07.480 --> 38:11.000]  and they tell them it's the law to take the shots so they give kids shots and
[38:11.000 --> 38:16.760]  parents say hey that's illegal they go see if the police will do anything hey

[38:21.160 --> 38:24.440]  pregnant I see these cases all the time that is the police aren't gonna do
[38:24.440 --> 38:32.360]  anything punk your daughter's eyes anyways that's how they work so it's
[38:32.360 --> 38:38.880]  the state and this is who's teaching your children this woman obviously would
[38:38.880 --> 38:43.760]  love to send my shell for you to a reeducation camp and the young man who's
[38:43.760 --> 38:47.200]  quite articulate so he keeps saying I'm not trying to slander him he's trying to
[38:47.200 --> 38:50.760]  agree with the teacher it's not slander to disagree with somebody it's not slander
[38:50.760 --> 38:53.920]  to say Obama's a crook when he is shipping guns into Mexico to blame the
[38:53.920 --> 38:58.000]  Second Amendment he didn't caught lying it's not slander to say John Corzine's a
[38:58.000 --> 39:03.920]  crook sue me John Corzine truth is the total defense
[39:04.480 --> 39:09.640]  truth is it I mean if I get appeared say Pepsi in these news reports and Pepsi

[39:39.680 --> 39:43.280]  just do a filing that obviously this is insane or you know stuff like that or
[39:43.280 --> 39:50.000]  but technically I've never really been sued knock on wood because I I believe
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.040]  I'm telling the truth there's no malice the forethought that's important and be
[39:54.040 --> 39:58.520]  I'm almost always going off legislation documents I witness this things like

[40:59.160 --> 41:04.240]  a few of those excerpts of land of the free home of the brave where you don't
[41:04.240 --> 41:08.120]  talk bad about the president and he says but people could talk about Romney
[41:08.120 --> 41:13.440]  Romney wants to be Obama he had no bomb so he can't and and he could tell this
[41:13.440 --> 41:19.640]  woman is feeling powerful through Obama yeah I mean I make the joke people
[41:19.640 --> 41:23.640]  used to love George Bush like he was their daddy I was at dinner with a
[41:23.640 --> 41:26.880]  really smart guy who knows about the new world order knows the west is funding
[41:26.880 --> 41:30.480]  al-Qaeda and terrorist as a pretext to be over there knows they're growing the
[41:30.480 --> 41:35.640]  oath opium knows it's about the lithium knows it all but still it's like yeah
[41:35.640 --> 41:38.400]  well when we're over there I'm sure he's training some of the military and
[41:38.400 --> 41:42.880]  people but it's not our military it's not our government and it's like I use
[41:42.880 --> 41:46.200]  well you know but he's mad because buddies have been killed so he wants to
[41:46.200 --> 41:49.800]  kill everybody over there and my whole point is but but but this was all
[41:49.800 --> 41:54.960]  artificial and it's like he just still couldn't register that even though he
[41:54.960 --> 42:00.320]  knew all the facts it is smart there was the cognitive dissidents of yeah but
[42:00.320 --> 42:04.480]  they hate us well yeah because for 60 70 years the West has been over there
[42:04.480 --> 42:08.280]  stirring those people up and putting radicals in every time those countries
[42:08.280 --> 42:11.120]  try to build themselves up yeah they're a bunch of radicals in the Middle East
[42:11.120 --> 42:15.080]  other areas have you looked at how the State Department and others radicalized
[42:15.080 --> 42:19.120]  them on purpose and paid to put in radical madrasa's even the Washington
[42:19.120 --> 42:22.520]  Post admits they did schoolbook free school books for the kids in the Middle
[42:22.520 --> 42:26.720]  East where it talks about g-hotting evil Westerners and four hang grenades plus
[42:26.720 --> 42:38.280]  three ish equals seven and he just couldn't register that and I'm like the
[42:38.280 --> 42:41.080]  other guys there and I'm like well you know the government kill Pat Tillman he
[42:41.080 --> 42:44.960]  goes yeah I know that but Pat Tillman's still a hero and I'm saying well yeah he
[42:44.960 --> 42:48.720]  gave up the football contract went because he believed in it but then he was
[42:48.720 --> 42:54.640]  even more of a hero when he found it was a fraud he said I'm gonna expose this and
[42:54.640 --> 42:59.080]  the Pentagon said we want you to get out just go back and be a big Ranger hero
[42:59.080 --> 43:02.480]  for propaganda purposes so you know what I'm just gonna stay here but for my
[43:02.480 --> 43:06.840]  buddies not for you so I get why but that's the trap they get you into the
[43:06.840 --> 43:10.200]  fight now with your buddies that are over there getting killed you're mad you
[43:10.200 --> 43:13.200]  want to go over there and kill the guys that are killing you they're killing you
[43:13.200 --> 43:17.880]  because they're mad it's called a vendetta and men do that that's normal
[43:17.880 --> 43:21.880]  five thousand six thousand years ago somebody kills somebody in your tribe
[43:21.880 --> 43:26.120]  you're gonna go back and you're gonna find them you're gonna kill them I get
[43:26.120 --> 43:30.600]  that but the globalist or scientific they're using sociology anthropology
[43:30.600 --> 43:36.320]  psychology to understand how men operate and how women operate to push our
[43:36.320 --> 43:41.760]  buttons to pull our chain to pull our string and you've got to get above that
[43:41.760 --> 43:48.320]  above emotion and then once you make a cold decision then use your emotion as
[43:48.320 --> 43:52.800]  your passion to fuel yourself there's a place for emotion but you have to
[43:52.800 --> 43:59.280]  control it and go wait a minute this whole thing staged okay but it's a side
[43:59.280 --> 44:06.120]  issue and I'm ranting the point is that TSA is under attack because you're
[44:06.120 --> 44:09.440]  doing things that are wrong they put you in a position everybody hates you now
[44:09.440 --> 44:13.800]  some of the people come in our cowards and act like they like you and go I'm
[44:13.800 --> 44:17.400]  sorry people are getting on to you and you smile at them and I'm so I'll barely
[44:17.400 --> 44:21.880]  pat your genitals down it's alright it's a little sick sympathizer collaborator
[44:21.880 --> 44:25.360]  thing this has all been worked out we're all singing to us somebody else's
[44:25.360 --> 44:29.760]  sheet of music we we've become drones puppets when that's why they call it a
[44:29.760 --> 44:33.760]  thing a role you're in this police role you're in this educator role you're in
[44:33.760 --> 44:38.120]  this bureaucratic role and you're supposed to follow the role and the more
[44:38.120 --> 44:42.640]  you play the role that means being cookie cutter like an automaton a biological
[44:42.640 --> 44:47.640]  android the more you excel in the system and so that allows central programmers
[44:47.640 --> 44:51.720]  with their teleprompters and their scripts to fully control society well
[44:51.720 --> 44:56.120]  let me explain something I'm off the reservation I'm not following anybody's
[44:56.120 --> 45:01.560]  role or script except the founders because I've read Play-Doh I've read
[45:01.560 --> 45:06.800]  Nietzsche I've read Cicero I've read it all let me tell you Thomas Jefferson
[45:06.800 --> 45:13.520]  she's got my number Patrick Henry's got my number those guys took the pure
[45:13.520 --> 45:17.440]  synthesis of all that knowledge and they had it right they produce the best
[45:17.440 --> 45:21.840]  system they know what's going on you know who do I follow I'm in that role
[45:21.840 --> 45:27.000]  okay that's that's the shoe that fits for me that's what makes my boat float
[45:27.000 --> 45:30.360]  that's what built this country that's what works that's what's got to prove
[45:30.360 --> 45:35.920]  that's what's wins the Super Bowl every year if you just implement it okay you
[45:35.920 --> 45:40.200]  want prosperity you want freedom but see the problem is you get that much
[45:40.200 --> 45:44.760]  freedom you get prosperity and you become decadent you become corrupt
[45:44.760 --> 45:49.680]  corruption is institutionalized and you are where we are Rome about to fall let's
[45:49.680 --> 45:54.200]  go ahead and go to Rome this is this is Rome a power-tripping bureaucrat this
[45:54.200 --> 45:59.240]  woman sounds just like the women cops big fat I mean I'm not bashing fat people
[45:59.240 --> 46:02.360]  because I've been a little overweight but there's something about giant fat
[46:02.360 --> 46:07.520]  women with batons beating peaceful protesters and laughing because it's
[46:07.520 --> 46:11.480]  like their ego and there's these big giant self-propelled stomachs beating
[46:11.480 --> 46:14.680]  people that may not have all the answers but at least have the first
[46:14.680 --> 46:18.680]  amendment or trying to do something protesting NATO and all these wars in
[46:18.680 --> 46:22.760]  narcotics trafficking and I saw the video this morning they're coming to give
[46:22.760 --> 46:26.800]  it to you guys of these big giant police women with nobody resisting them
[46:26.800 --> 46:32.320]  beating people with batons in in Chicago and I mean if that isn't pathetic and
[46:32.320 --> 46:40.080]  they're smiling they're laughing and oh it's so pathetic and that's what big
[46:40.080 --> 46:45.840]  government gives you a world where all these nobodies I mean a somebody is too
[46:45.840 --> 46:52.320]  prideful to want to go and beat people with a billy club you know somebody
[46:52.320 --> 46:55.360]  who's got respect for themselves would only use a billy club on somebody when
[46:55.360 --> 46:59.760]  they had to and somebody who somebody'd have to hold back not to kill you with
[46:59.760 --> 47:04.680]  the first strike but somebody who's a nobody has got all this stuff to prove
[47:04.680 --> 47:10.120]  and it's it's totally sick it's totally totally sick I mean I'm talking about
[47:10.120 --> 47:15.280]  women whose rear ends are probably four feet across okay I'm talking about
[47:15.280 --> 47:19.880]  self-propelled hippopotamuses beating peaceful people in the first amendment
[47:19.880 --> 47:23.720]  and now clearly they set up these people that you know one of them has a criminal
[47:23.720 --> 47:27.760]  record for getting drunk on tequila and breaking into a swimming pool if that was
[47:27.760 --> 47:31.360]  the case I'd be in jail cuz I did some stuff like that in high school you know
[47:31.360 --> 47:35.000]  climbing fences and stuff jumping the swimming pool even though your friends
[47:35.000 --> 47:37.880]  got a swimming pool let's go down to the community pool and climb the fence and
[47:37.880 --> 47:43.720]  you know jumping the pool let's throw the pool furniture in used to you know
[47:43.720 --> 47:46.720]  the cops would just come and you know take you home and you get in trouble
[47:46.720 --> 47:50.320]  nowadays you end up dead but side issue let's go ahead and go to this tape here
[47:50.320 --> 47:56.320]  this
[47:56.320 --> 47:58.320]  all I have is a question you freaked out
[47:58.320 --> 48:01.320]  no I told you do not
[48:01.320 --> 48:05.320]  it was a question it was a question
[48:05.320 --> 48:12.320]  about me as a teacher I'm not supposed to love you to disrespect the president of the United States
[48:12.320 --> 48:16.320]  I didn't disrespect him I was just asking questions
[48:16.320 --> 48:22.320]  I have different beliefs whenever Bush was in everybody talk about Bush everybody did
[48:22.320 --> 48:24.320]  no everybody was cheating
[48:24.320 --> 48:28.320]  actually everybody talked about Bush
[48:28.320 --> 48:32.320]  wait wait if you ever said anything bad about Bush
[48:32.320 --> 48:35.320]  he was in office about a minute
[48:35.320 --> 48:40.320]  do you know do you realize that people were arrested for saying things bad about Bush
[48:40.320 --> 48:42.320]  it doesn't matter
[48:42.320 --> 48:46.320]  you realize you are not you can't you're not supposed to slander
[48:46.320 --> 48:48.320]  I'm not slandering I ask the question
[48:48.320 --> 48:49.320]  but I'm saying
[48:49.320 --> 48:51.320]  it's not slander that I'm unbelievable
[48:51.320 --> 48:52.320]  you're not supposed to slander
[48:52.320 --> 48:57.320]  people were arrested for saying and not saying things about Bush
[48:57.320 --> 49:01.320]  you would have to say some pretty effed up crap to get him to be arrested
[49:01.320 --> 49:05.320]  because they cannot take away your right to have your opinion or your freedom of speech
[49:05.320 --> 49:07.320]  they can't take that away even if you're a sweetheart
[49:07.320 --> 49:09.320]  unless you threaten the president
[49:09.320 --> 49:10.320]  sweetheart
[49:10.320 --> 49:13.320]  you know everybody thinks that when you're arrested
[49:13.320 --> 49:16.320]  you're supposed to be able to read your rights to you
[49:16.320 --> 49:18.320]  but they don't read your rights to you every time you're arrested
[49:18.320 --> 49:20.320]  did you know that
[49:20.320 --> 49:23.320]  but did you know that though
[49:23.320 --> 49:25.320]  okay
[49:25.320 --> 49:28.320]  okay so that's what I'm telling you
[49:28.320 --> 49:31.320]  I'm saying that to you
[49:31.320 --> 49:33.320]  I'm saying
[49:33.320 --> 49:36.320]  some people did talk bad about Bush
[49:36.320 --> 49:38.320]  but the thing about it is
[49:38.320 --> 49:40.320]  he was the president of the United States
[49:40.320 --> 49:42.320]  and there were people
[49:42.320 --> 49:44.320]  who were arrested
[49:44.320 --> 49:46.320]  or reprimanded for saying
[49:46.320 --> 49:48.320]  for bad things
[49:48.320 --> 49:49.320]  listen to this idiot
[49:49.320 --> 49:51.320]  that's who teaches your children
[49:51.320 --> 49:53.320]  but see the thing about it is
[49:53.320 --> 49:54.320]  guess what
[49:54.320 --> 49:56.320]  how much you want to bet this woman looks like an eponymous
[49:56.320 --> 49:58.320]  at the time
[49:58.320 --> 50:01.320]  so had to deal with what had to be dealt right
[50:01.320 --> 50:03.320]  you got to deal with it
[50:03.320 --> 50:05.320]  that's right
[50:05.320 --> 50:07.320]  as a social studies teacher
[50:07.320 --> 50:10.320]  I could not allow you to slander any president
[50:10.320 --> 50:13.320]  in his past or current
[50:13.320 --> 50:15.320]  yes ma'am
[50:15.320 --> 50:17.320]  yes yes tyrant yes yes ma'am
[50:17.320 --> 50:19.320]  and it just goes on and on
[50:19.320 --> 50:20.320]  there's like ten minutes of it
[50:20.320 --> 50:21.320]  I'm sure you've already heard it
[50:21.320 --> 50:23.320]  again we would have heard it yesterday
[50:23.320 --> 50:25.320]  but we had three guests on
[50:25.320 --> 50:28.320]  but to listen to this really really is disgusting
[50:28.320 --> 50:32.320]  and I've seen him kick people out of school
[50:32.320 --> 50:34.320]  like Mr. Wannick
[50:34.320 --> 50:35.320]  he's now out of high school
[50:35.320 --> 50:37.320]  because he said vaccines are dangerous
[50:37.320 --> 50:39.320]  and talk to other students
[50:39.320 --> 50:41.320]  they're like that's it you're in trouble
[50:41.320 --> 50:42.320]  you're not allowed to do that
[50:42.320 --> 50:43.320]  in America
[50:43.320 --> 50:46.320]  and you've got these people in bureaucracies everywhere
[50:46.320 --> 50:48.320]  I mean imagine the police
[50:48.320 --> 50:50.320]  arresting people nationwide
[50:50.320 --> 50:51.320]  for filming them in public
[50:51.320 --> 50:53.320]  I mean that's crazy criminal
[50:53.320 --> 50:55.320]  they have become
[50:55.320 --> 50:57.320]  what North Korean police are in many cases
[50:57.320 --> 50:59.320]  when they act like that
[50:59.320 --> 51:01.320]  you
[51:03.320 --> 51:05.320]  folks have you lost your power
[51:05.320 --> 51:06.320]  and wanted to simply flip a switch
[51:06.320 --> 51:07.320]  to get the lights back on
[51:07.320 --> 51:09.320]  if so this is going to be
[51:09.320 --> 51:11.320]  the most important message you'll ever hear
[51:11.320 --> 51:13.320]  because there's never been a better time
[51:13.320 --> 51:15.320]  to get ready for the winter power outages ahead
[51:15.320 --> 51:16.320]  here's why
[51:16.320 --> 51:19.320]  solar power generators are now available
[51:19.320 --> 51:21.320]  from our friends at Solutions from Science
[51:21.320 --> 51:22.320]  one of our oldest sponsors
[51:22.320 --> 51:24.320]  their emergency backup systems
[51:24.320 --> 51:26.320]  provide life saving electrical power
[51:26.320 --> 51:27.320]  when you need it most
[51:27.320 --> 51:29.320]  unlike gas generators
[51:29.320 --> 51:31.320]  a solar generator runs quietly
[51:31.320 --> 51:32.320]  emits no fumes
[51:32.320 --> 51:34.320]  and produces electricity from the sun
[51:34.320 --> 51:36.320]  it's like having an electric power plant
[51:36.320 --> 51:38.320]  running quietly in your own own
[51:38.320 --> 51:39.320]  whether it's ice storms
[51:39.320 --> 51:40.320]  brownouts or blackouts
[51:40.320 --> 51:42.320]  you'll never have to suffer
[51:42.320 --> 51:44.320]  through painful power outages again
[51:44.320 --> 51:45.320]  when the power goes out this winter
[51:45.320 --> 51:46.320]  you'll be ready

[54:53.320 --> 54:56.320]  there's a neighbor saw him with a BB gun and then they
[54:56.320 --> 55:00.320]  they found the toy laws rocket
[55:00.320 --> 55:04.320]  man I remember being a kid buying those in army navy stores
[55:04.320 --> 55:08.320]  we would run around with those we'd stick estus rockets in them
[55:08.320 --> 55:11.320]  this country is scary I mean they are looking for terrorists so bad

[55:32.320 --> 55:36.320]  alright this is not an attack call this is just a grievance call
[55:36.320 --> 55:40.320]  I'm just like where you were maybe 15-20 years ago
[55:40.320 --> 55:43.320]  I'm getting started as a researcher here in the northwest
[55:43.320 --> 55:45.320]  I call it Northwest Truth
[55:45.320 --> 55:48.320]  bringing truth to a world of lies
[55:48.320 --> 55:52.320]  that's my mission good my problem is
[55:52.320 --> 55:55.320]  I'm having difficulty getting a resource
[55:55.320 --> 55:58.320]  this is the type of person I am when somebody challenges me
[55:58.320 --> 56:01.320]  I remember you called twice about saying a preacher
[56:01.320 --> 56:04.320]  called you aside and told you not to talk about the new world order
[56:04.320 --> 56:09.320]  or something exactly well he said I gotta let you go sir
[56:09.320 --> 56:12.320]  I mean you keep calling here saying you want to talk to
[56:12.320 --> 56:15.320]  have me be your secretary and get you a hold of people
[56:15.320 --> 56:18.320]  I just can't do that I mean I'm not an operator service
[56:18.320 --> 56:21.320]  I barely have time to see my children
[56:21.320 --> 56:24.320]  that's really one of my source spots right there
[56:24.320 --> 56:27.320]  we don't screen your calls and people just kind of get something
[56:27.320 --> 56:30.320]  their idea that I'm gonna get them in touch with somebody
[56:30.320 --> 56:33.320]  we got people to call it every day and say you're gonna get me in touch with Ron Paul
[56:33.320 --> 56:36.320]  as if I can get in touch with Ron Paul easily
[56:36.320 --> 56:40.320]  I used to cause it's super hard they got that guy running 24-7 on the road
[56:40.320 --> 56:43.320]  Richard and Arizona you're on the year welcome
[56:43.320 --> 56:47.320]  yeah hi Alex I'm really happy to get through to you thank you
[56:47.320 --> 56:48.320]  welcome
[56:48.320 --> 56:51.320]  if I can be fast enough I'd like to go through two suggestions
[56:51.320 --> 56:55.320]  and two bumper stickers so this is what I've been trying to call in
[56:55.320 --> 56:58.320]  for quite a while the first suggestion up to you
[56:58.320 --> 57:01.320]  but I would really like it if your organization could start a group
[57:01.320 --> 57:05.320]  and I think the name of this group would tell you what it's about
[57:05.320 --> 57:08.320]  it's called the Northern Affluence Freedom Center
[57:08.320 --> 57:11.320]  and I think there's a lot that could be done with that
[57:11.320 --> 57:14.320]  maybe somebody can digest that and see if it's worth it
[57:14.320 --> 57:17.320]  man I tell you these calls I gotta be honest I just don't understand
[57:17.320 --> 57:18.320]  maybe I'm stupid
[57:18.320 --> 57:22.320]  like a guy calls up wants me to get in my hold of somebody
[57:22.320 --> 57:24.320]  like Fritz Springmeyer over and over again
[57:24.320 --> 57:28.320]  and then you're telling me about a Northern Affluence Center I don't understand
[57:28.320 --> 57:31.320]  let me explain real fast cause I don't want to use up my time
[57:31.320 --> 57:35.320]  the Southern Poverty Law Center I think you've heard of those guys who talk about them all the time
[57:35.320 --> 57:38.320]  this is the antidote this is the antidote
[57:38.320 --> 57:43.320]  Northern Affluence Freedom Center it's the total opposite
[57:43.320 --> 57:46.320]  if you don't like the idea it's okay but that's what it was about
[57:46.320 --> 57:50.320]  the second thing is as far as Fukushima goes
[57:50.320 --> 57:54.320]  which is like Mike Adams was talking about it being the most immediate threat to survival
[57:54.320 --> 57:58.320]  in the Northern Hemisphere cause of the structure that's about to collapse
[57:58.320 --> 58:04.320]  HHO gas has a potential for neutralizing radiation
[58:04.320 --> 58:07.320]  and maybe somebody can do something with that
[58:07.320 --> 58:10.320]  going real fast here the two bumper stickers
[58:10.320 --> 58:16.320]  I was gonna call up as a fairness police but I wasn't up to it this morning
[58:16.320 --> 58:23.320]  and I was gonna say that oh you're talking too much about Ron Paul and we need you to put out two bumper stickers
[58:23.320 --> 58:27.320]  one is fascists for peace reelect Barry Satoro
[58:27.320 --> 58:30.320]  and I want a mushroom cloud with red white and blue in the background
[58:30.320 --> 58:32.320]  beautiful idea sir and that's a great idea
[58:32.320 --> 58:36.320]  we need an organization that is the counter to the Anti-Defamation League
[58:36.320 --> 58:38.320]  in the Southern Poverty Slime Center
[58:43.320 --> 58:47.320]  this is GCN the Genesis Communications Radio Network
[58:50.320 --> 58:54.320]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[58:54.320 --> 58:59.320]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:59.320 --> 59:05.320]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[59:05.320 --> 59:10.320]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[59:10.320 --> 59:15.320]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[59:15.320 --> 59:19.320]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[59:19.320 --> 59:22.320]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[59:22.320 --> 59:26.320]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[59:26.320 --> 59:31.320]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[59:31.320 --> 59:34.320]  folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science
[59:34.320 --> 59:36.320]  one of my oldest sponsors
[59:36.320 --> 59:40.320]  you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[59:40.320 --> 59:42.320]  that's mysolarbackup.com
[59:42.320 --> 59:46.320]  remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com
[59:46.320 --> 59:57.320]  or call 1-877-327-0365
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:20.320]  and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:22.320]  Alex Jones
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:27.320]  coming up we're gonna cover medical news for a while then we're gonna have open phones in the
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:32.320]  hour coming up after that with a huge blitz of news we've already covered quite a bit
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.320]  I got a bunch of medical news coming up after the break
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.320]  right now let's go back to your calls
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:40.320]  let's go ahead and talk to John in New York
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.320]  John welcome
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.320]  hey Alex
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:44.320]  hey
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:48.320]  long time listener but the first-time caller
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:52.320]  talk about the teacher there
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:56.320]  that's very interesting because I was a teacher
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:00.320]  and I saw all kinds of things like that
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:04.320]  it's been coming over the last 15-20 years
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.320]  there've been a lot of things we had to watch for
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:11.320]  kids you know being abused and such and had to report it
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:15.320]  they had us doing all kinds of things like that
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:22.320]  and now with this teacher saying you can't criticize the president
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:25.320]  that's pretty ridiculous
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:28.320]  well it's not happening in a vacuum
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:31.320]  I've got TV news where they said
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.320]  talk about the president you'll be arrested in Missouri
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.320]  I mean that's on record
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:39.320]  they admit they have reeducation camps
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.320]  police are arresting people for filming them everywhere
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:46.320]  the system is trying to create an atmosphere
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.320]  that there is no free speech
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:51.320]  look free speech isn't just your speech on the street
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:53.320]  the big part is religion
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.320]  look at how they're telling churches
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.320]  not just the Catholic church but they're fighting back
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:01.320]  that they've got to pay for abortions and birth control
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:04.320]  that they've got to hire people that aren't part of their faith
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.320]  I mean that's ridiculous
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:10.320]  I go to a Jewish synagogue or a Muslim mosque
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:14.320]  and say hey I'm a pig slaughterer and I'm a Satanist
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:17.320]  and I'd like to work as your accountant
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.320]  and they're like no we're not going to hire you
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.320]  we don't hire Satanists
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.320]  and then I sue them
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:26.320]  I mean this is ridiculous
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.320]  that's my point
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:32.320]  all of these things have not been happening just instantly
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:37.320]  these things have been coming on for 25, 30 years now
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:40.320]  I remember a comment to my father-in-law
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.320]  I was always precocious in that
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:44.320]  because I always think outside the box
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:47.320]  and I was looking at all the things that were going on
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:53.320]  and way back in Reagan Bush era
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:56.320]  and I was looking at all the economic things
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.320]  how they were manipulating the economy
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.320]  I said you know they're just going to make America
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:03.320]  a third world country my father-in-law
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.320]  he said that's correct
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.320]  he was a director of community relations
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:10.320]  for Cornell University during that time
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.320]  and we've got a bunch of spoiled brats
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.320]  that run around and think they're part of the power structure
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:18.320]  who enjoy, I call them collaborators
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:20.320]  they enjoy the darkening skies
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.320]  they enjoy nightfall in the republic
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.320]  they think they're going to get this power
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:27.320]  and have fun in this authoritarian system
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.320]  and all they're going to get is they're head-stoveed in
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.320]  that's right
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:34.320]  absolutely
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:36.320]  but we're not a third world country
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:38.320]  we're becoming one the system wants to make us one
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.320]  but there are millions of people
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:43.320]  probably 50, 60 million who have not drunk the Kool-Aid
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.320]  who'll never go along with them
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:46.320]  and the systems answer
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:49.320]  as the weathermen told Obama and the rest of them is
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.320]  they're going to set up giant camps and try to arrest us
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:54.320]  well you're not going to because we're not Russia or Germany
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:57.320]  we have guns and we're going to use them in defense
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.320]  and you can call us terrorists all day
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.320]  everybody knows you're the terrorist
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:05.320]  it's not us, we're doing everything we can to try to fix this peacefully
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:09.320]  the irony is that I have five sons
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:13.320]  and I can't convince anybody of any of these things
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.320]  no matter how much I try
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:18.320]  they all like Obama and they want to
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:21.320]  they think these things are wonderful
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:25.320]  really did they think 20 plus billion to move General Motors out of the US?
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.320]  I mean paying to...
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:29.320]  it's one thing to have tax incentives to get the jobs to leave
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:32.320]  again they just watch TV and believe that's real
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:35.320]  see the smiling people, the teleprompters and acting like
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:37.320]  oh let's see what the public thinks
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:40.320]  but it's all in a controlled narrow spectrum
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:43.320]  and look, don't lose heart
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:46.320]  because it's always dark as before the dawn the cliche goes
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.320]  because it's true
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.320]  people that are in a trance
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:52.320]  everything seems real till they come out of them
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.320]  and things are going to happen to them
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.320]  that are going to break them out of their trance
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:20.320]  and you make sure the seeds are planted
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.320]  and also delivers the silver nano particles
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:31.320]  instantly into the bloodstream
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:35.320]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:39.320]  you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.320]  with the Silver Lungs Generator
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:44.320]  very easy to follow step by step instructions are provided

[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:27.320]  www.silverlungs.com
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:56.320]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:00.320]  this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.320]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:05.320]  proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:08.320]  because there's a war on for your mind
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:26.320]  okay ladies and gentlemen we are back live into another hour of the Alex Jones show
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:32.320]  I am your host Alex Jones it is Tuesday the 22nd day of May 2012
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:34.320]  coming up in the next hour
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:39.320]  we'll continue with Peter John Darrell Jeremiah and others
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:42.320]  but what I may do is actually have to call those people back
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:44.320]  they want to give us their numbers
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:48.320]  or we can open up my own phone system here and keep them on hold
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:49.320]  now that I think about it
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:52.320]  because I wanted to get Dr. Joel Wallach back on
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:57.320]  because of popular demand to have him take at least a half hour of phone calls
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:59.320]  for questions from people
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:04.320]  because so many times we get him on
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:06.320]  and then we say we're going to take calls
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:09.320]  and then 100 calls come in and we can't go to two or three
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:11.320]  so I wanted to get him back up today
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:14.320]  and start having him on at least once a month
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:17.320]  because the listeners really responded in a positive way
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:20.320]  and if I'm enjoying something and finding it informative
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:22.320]  and my audience really loves it
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:26.320]  well then you're going to hear more of it here on the broadcast
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:33.320]  but I wanted myself to bring up some other issues with Dr. Wallach first
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:35.320]  and that's from my research
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:37.320]  the diet that Americans ate
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:41.320]  we would see today as even more unhealthy than the diet we have on the surface
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:45.320]  more fat, more red meat, more chicken fried steak
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:49.320]  more fried chicken, pie at lunch, pie at dinner
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:52.320]  but people were skinny, they were healthier like the French
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:55.320]  the French have what they would call an extremely unhealthy diet
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:58.320]  but there's no preservatives
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:01.320]  they smoke cigarettes like trains
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.320]  they drink like fish and they live on average
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:06.320]  I was looking about eight years longer
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.320]  same thing with the Japanese
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:10.320]  they ate a lot of stuff you'd call unhealthy
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:11.320]  but nothing like the French
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:13.320]  what happened to Americans?
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:16.320]  because when I see these articles in the media
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:19.320]  it's always let's reduce salt
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:22.320]  or let's reduce just fat period
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:25.320]  or let's reduce just basic sugar
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.320]  and I'm not saying sugar straight up is good for you
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.320]  it obviously is in overall
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.320]  there's no discussion of aspartame
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.320]  of MSG
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:37.320]  there's no discussion of GMO
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:40.320]  that in all the studies that you just type in GMO causes organ failure
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.320]  and sterility and lab rats
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.320]  and it's just hundreds and hundreds of articles
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:47.320]  with hundreds and hundreds of studies, thousands total
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:50.320]  literally it's in the thousands in the last 50 years
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.320]  that's why they wouldn't approve it until the 70s and 80s
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:54.320]  and now it's basically in everything
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.320]  I mean it's hard to get away from
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:59.320]  and it has its own pesticide grown in it
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:02.320]  that kills the bugs but they say it's safe for you many varieties
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:04.320]  this is some scary stuff
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:06.320]  the honey bees are dying
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.320]  farm animals are having weird health problems when they eat GMO
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.320]  I've talked to the vets about that
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:12.320]  and they're getting away from it
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:14.320]  a lot of the animal feeds are trying to get away from it
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.320]  because there's all sorts of craziness going on
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.320]  all sorts of craziness
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:20.320]  taking place here
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:22.320]  and meanwhile here's this headline
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.320]  chefs call proposed New York salt ban
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.320]  absurd
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.320]  well Blumberg doesn't care he says he's going to go ahead with it
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.320]  and they catch you with salt
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.320]  it's like $1,000 fines
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.320]  jail the next time
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:36.320]  and no discussion of getting clean water
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.320]  no discussion
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.320]  I mean they tell Alzheimer's patients don't get essential fatty acids
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.320]  they tell people
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:44.320]  you know don't get minerals
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.320]  when there's literally
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.320]  they have scurvy
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.320]  that's the old people everywhere they have scurvy
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.320]  their skins breaking down
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.320]  their old scars roping up
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.320]  that's scurvy
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:58.320]  so I saw an article
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:00.320]  in the Associated Press
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:02.320]  just a few days ago
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:04.320]  Reuters it's all over the news where they were saying
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.320]  we need to give healthy people statins
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.320]  we need lithium in the water
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:10.320]  because people are upset
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:12.320]  they say people want to commit suicide or they're depressed
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.320]  or
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.320]  admits that it causes suicide and psychotic behavior
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.320]  in the insert
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:20.320]  so they know what they're doing it
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:22.320]  they know exactly
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:24.320]  why they're doing it NHS
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:26.320]  that's in England should consider giving statins
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:28.320]  to healthy people they're talking about giving 3 year olds
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.320]  and up in the US statins
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:32.320]  putting it in the water supply this is being done
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.320]  by design this is eugenics
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:36.320]  so I wanted the first 15-20 minutes
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:38.320]  with Dr. Wallach before we open the phones up
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.320]  to get him on with us
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:42.320]  and bring this up because I have some
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.320]  some new news on the health front
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:46.320]  as well
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.320]  exactly what Wallach has been saying for decades
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:50.320]  saturated fats make people
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:52.320]  dumber that's the Atlantic
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:54.320]  but they just say meat period
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:56.320]  no it's burnt meat
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:58.320]  here's another one out of Marcolla
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.320]  hardens your arteries odds are 6 to 10
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.320]  you're consuming this poison ingredient
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:04.320]  daily it's actually 7 and 10 from my research
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.320]  70% of the country has fluoride
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:08.320]  it's fluoride all the big studies out on that
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.320]  hardening your arteries increasing
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.320]  problems in the joints
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:14.320]  continuing here
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:16.320]  FDA accused of mass
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:18.320]  homicide of 1 million Americans each year
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:20.320]  it breaks down all the numbers incredible
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:22.320]  we're going to be going over that
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.320]  drinking high fructose corn syrup really does make you stupid
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:26.320]  another big study out we're going to be going over
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.320]  that's yahoo science daily
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.320]  and natural news reporting that
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.320]  so that's just some of this
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.320]  we're under a chemical
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:36.320]  biological holocaust
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.320]  now Dr. Joel Wallach joins
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:40.320]  us today via video skype
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.320]  if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:44.320]  on the radio hearing the superior audio
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.320]  quality of skype it's revolutionizing
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.320]  radio that's getting so good the audio
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.320]  quality of the guest now it's like they're in studio
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.320]  Dr. Joel Wallach
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:54.320]  has published numerous books bestsellers
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.320]  and dietary deficiencies in their
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:58.320]  result and
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.320]  effects and the fact
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:02.320]  that it causes a lot of the disease out there
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:04.320]  he conducts 300 lectures
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.320]  annually
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:08.320]  and of course he's the host of dead doctors
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.320]  don't lie
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.320]  he has worked for 30 years
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:14.320]  in veterinary pathologist
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:16.320]  at several institutions universities
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:18.320]  and it just goes
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.320]  on from there and he's got other
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:22.320]  degrees as well he taught
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:24.320]  nutrition at the national college of
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:26.320]  naturopathic medicine in Oregon
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.320]  became a primary care physician with naturopathic
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.320]  degree and it just goes
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.320]  on from that point and dead doctors
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.320]  don't lie doctors have
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.320]  one of the lowest life expectancies
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:38.320]  out there think only worse is
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.320]  gays
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:42.320]  and gangbangers that's just a fact
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:44.320]  but dead doctors don't lie
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.320]  he joins us now so you heard me
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.320]  give that preface doc of what's happening
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.320]  there I see the system
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:52.320]  while they kill us by design
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:54.320]  make us sick and then sell us treatments
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:56.320]  that don't actually cure us they
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:58.320]  they treat the cause of
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:00.320]  what they've already done they always look for the cure
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:02.320]  not the cause of breast cancer being at
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.320]  3,000 percentage points and every other
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:06.320]  neurological disorder diabetes type 2
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.320]  you name it neurological disorders
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:10.320]  and young people skyrocketing
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:12.320]  now they're scapegoating
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.320]  salt and fat period
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:16.320]  what's happening here
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.320]  with this new nanny state saying
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.320]  we're going to force prescription drugs on you
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:22.320]  and we're going to tell you what you can eat
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:26.320]  Dr. Wallach
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.320]  yes well thank you so much Alex
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.320]  first of all I want to applaud you
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:32.320]  for being so up on this
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.320]  information and getting it out to the general public
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.320]  we are in a war
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.320]  there's no doubt about it
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.320]  and you are the point of the spear
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:42.320]  you are the marines for protecting Americans
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:44.320]  and I love you for it
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:46.320]  and just to kind of reiterate
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:48.320]  some of the things you said
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:50.320]  they're definitely trying to get statin drugs into
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:52.320]  kids this is
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.320]  came out just two years ago
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:56.320]  the American Academy of Pediatrics
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:58.320]  said this is the strongest
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:00.320]  pro-pronouncement they've ever made
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:02.320]  was to get kids under 8 years old
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:04.320]  on statin drugs to prevent heart disease
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:06.320]  well heart disease is not
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:08.320]  caused by elevated blood
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:10.320]  cholesterol and triglycerides
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:12.320]  and I said that in 1971
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:14.320]  it's actually published in an international
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.320]  paper
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:18.320]  published out of Denmark
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.320]  an act of pathologica
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.320]  in both English and English
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:24.320]  and I said that time after 20,000 autopsies
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.320]  elevated blood cholesterol and triglycerides
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.320]  have nothing to do
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:30.320]  with stroke, heart disease, clogged arteries
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:32.320]  it's actually the inflammation
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:34.320]  from eating fried foods, processed meats
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:36.320]  and using oils
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.320]  and salad dressings and so forth
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:40.320]  and again you point out very well
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:42.320]  even yet today Alex
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.320]  the top 20 longevity cultures on earth still
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.320]  smoke they do things that would be
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.320]  considered to be bad
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:50.320]  but they are able to get through that
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:52.320]  and they're the longest lived cultures on earth
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:54.320]  number one they're all illiterate
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:56.320]  doctors, no clinics, no hospitals
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.320]  yet they have 40 times 100 oils we do
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:00.320]  that's because they do the basic things
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.320]  our ancestor did, your grandparents
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.320]  and my grandparents used to put wood ashes
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.320]  from the home fires either the fireplace
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:08.320]  or the wood stove into
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.320]  the garden, the beans
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:12.320]  and tomatoes and sweet potatoes and squash
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:14.320]  would suck up these minerals you would eat them
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:16.320]  and you'd nourish your body in that fashion
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:18.320]  well when we went to electricity
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:20.320]  and propane and natural gas there's no wood
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:22.320]  ashes left over to put in our food or in our gardens
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:24.320]  and this is lack of supplementation
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:26.320]  that we used to do
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:28.320]  for thousands of years that's causing us the problems
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.320]  now we've done it for dogs
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:32.320]  we've tripled the lifespan of dogs the last
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.320]  60 years from 8 years old
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:36.320]  60 years ago to 25 today
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:38.320]  we've eliminated 900 different diseases
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.320]  and if you're a homeless person
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.320]  eating dog food you're going to outlive
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:44.320]  doctors and billionaires just crazy
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:46.320]  but that's the truth because we put all the known nutrients
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.320]  in dog food and
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:50.320]  we've come up with a system
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.320]  with young givety and the
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:54.320]  90 for life program
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.320]  where we duplicate all the knowledge that was learned
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:58.320]  for our dogs and cats
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:00.320]  and chickens and fish
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.320]  and cattle and sheep and pigs and horses
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.320]  and we put it into this program 90 for life
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:06.320]  and it's been working because
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.320]  agriculture demands results
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:10.320]  and so that lobby hasn't let
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:12.320]  the big medical
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.320]  lobby come in and ruin it because people
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.320]  want results there and
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.320]  all the information is at infowarsteam.com
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.320]  since we're getting into that now
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.320]  people want to get the teni tangerine
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:24.320]  polymers and get it discounted
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.320]  you can sign up and get discounts there
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.320]  or get free shipping at infowarsteam.com
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.320]  but I want to understand
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.320]  why are they doing this
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:34.320]  I mean sure there's eugenics and part of the overall plan
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.320]  but I even see like you said
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.320]  the doctors are following their own advice
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:40.320]  and dying at very young ages
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:42.320]  absolutely
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:44.320]  the average lifespan of a medical doctor
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:46.320]  according to their own surveys
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.320]  in 1999 is 56
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.320]  billionaires who follow the doctor's instructions
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:52.320]  who should have
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:54.320]  the highest rate of 100 year olds
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.320]  to be the healthiest as of march of
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:58.320]  2011 is 66
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.320]  and then of course
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.320]  I have somebody like Steve Jobs
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.320]  who died at 56 following the doctor's instructions
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:06.320]  and he should have gone to the Nikoyan peninsula
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.320]  in Costa Rica
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:10.320]  where the oldest people on earth live
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:12.320]  and do a grandma
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.320]  he'd still be alive today but he chose
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:16.320]  the doctors and they killed him
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.320]  well the problem here is
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.320]  the medical system has learned how to use
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:22.320]  the insurance programs
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.320]  as an ATM machine
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.320]  whereas in the agricultural industry Alex
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:28.320]  as you pointed out you're very quick
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:30.320]  you figured this out right away
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:32.320]  in that in the agricultural industry
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:34.320]  we don't have health insurance
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.320]  and so the veterinarians in the agricultural industry
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.320]  just had to solve the problems
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:40.320]  because if you have a pig that needs
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:42.320]  they got bone to bone arthritis
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.320]  and if you have a pig transplant
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.320]  he's bacon tomorrow
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:48.320]  in humans we have insurance and so doctors
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.320]  have learned how to milk bet insurance
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.320]  was actually a senate committee came out
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:54.320]  a couple years ago and said that the medical system
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.320]  is gaming, medicare and medicare
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:58.320]  stay there and absolutely and the doctors
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.320]  that aren't doing it
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:02.320]  they're getting the short end of the stick
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:04.320]  we'll be back with Dr. Wallach

[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.320]  and there's a lot of other great products out there
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:20.320]  of all the people that have come to me over the years
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:22.320]  and offered
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:24.320]  you know for me to endorse their product
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:26.320]  and
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:28.320]  I've seen the proof with young Jevity
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:30.320]  and that's why I endorse it
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:32.320]  and that's why we have
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:34.320]  infowarsteam.com with the products discounted
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.320]  you can go there and buy the products

[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:44.320]  but I didn't get Dr. Wallach
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:46.320]  on predominantly about that today
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:48.320]  I'm coming up in the next segment
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:50.320]  I'm going to open the phones up
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.320]  your questions for Dr. Wallach
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.320]  this stuff is real I mean you've seen
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:56.320]  Aaron Dykes lose
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:58.320]  92 pounds now and now he's
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:00.320]  trying to you know stop
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:02.320]  and actually just build some muscle
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:04.320]  and that's actually working
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:06.320]  but 90 plus pounds I've lost about
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:08.320]  40 and because I work out
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:10.320]  not as much as I was
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.320]  even before I'm working out less and just staying
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.320]  at the same spot now because I'm so busy
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:16.320]  I didn't get home last night till midnight I worked late
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:18.320]  but the point is
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:20.320]  that look at Dr. Wallach
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.320]  if you're watching on PrismPlanet.tv
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:24.320]  he's about to turn 73
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:26.320]  and I've seen videos of him
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:28.320]  on stage just the last month where it looks
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:30.320]  like he's about 60
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:32.320]  just amazing
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.320]  amazing to see what this is doing
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.320]  so I briefly wanted you Doc to get into
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:38.320]  those cultures because I know
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:40.320]  that there are a lot of ancient cultures
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:42.320]  that live even longer if they live
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:44.320]  past the natal point
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:46.320]  they manipulate numbers because in a lot of primitive cultures
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:48.320]  yes
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:50.320]  30-40% of babies by the age of 2 or 3
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:52.320]  do tend to die because of complications
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:54.320]  but if you get past that point
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:56.320]  I've really looked at the
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:58.320]  at the numbers
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.320]  on population
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:02.320]  in even third world areas
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:04.320]  and there's people all over the place living to 80
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:06.320]  90 100
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:08.320]  I mean my great grandmother lived to be 103
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:10.320]  I had a bunch of ancestors
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:12.320]  if we go back in the records
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:14.320]  who were you were keenly living to
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:16.320]  100 men
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:18.320]  and this was on the frontier
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:20.320]  so if you made it past 3 years old
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:22.320]  on what the frontier people were eating
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:24.320]  how were they living so long
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:26.320]  again this is one of their big secrets
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.320]  that you've really exposed
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:30.320]  what are the ancient cultures
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:32.320]  but also what are the French doing
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:34.320]  smoking two packs of cigarettes drinking like fish
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:36.320]  living a lot longer than we do
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:38.320]  what are they doing
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.320]  well again you hit the nail on the head Alex
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.320]  the top 20 longevity cultures
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:44.320]  and I put it in our newest book
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:46.320]  called Immortality
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:48.320]  and they can get it through infowars.team.com
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:50.320]  infowars.team.com
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:52.320]  and we looked at the top 20
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:54.320]  longevity cultures
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:56.320]  to try and find their common threads
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:58.320]  and we found 25 common threads amongst them
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:00.320]  and you're exactly right
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:02.320]  they do drink alcohol, they do smoke
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:04.320]  and they have 40 times 100
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:06.320]  they don't have doctors, they don't have insurance
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:08.320]  they don't have hospitals
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:10.320]  they have 40 times 100
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:12.320]  60 of their population
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.320]  100 per 10,000
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:16.320]  they have 40 times 100
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:18.320]  they live to be 90 on the average in a health way
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:20.320]  we live to be 75 in a sickly way
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:22.320]  it's because of dumb luck
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:24.320]  by actual analyses of the soil
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:26.320]  by the agricultural departments in their countries
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:28.320]  they live in a place that have
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:30.320]  these 90 essential nutrients
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:32.320]  in their food, there's 60 minerals in the soil
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:34.320]  their plants take it up
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:36.320]  the wood they burn has these 60 minerals in it
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:38.320]  they put these wood ashes, the minerals
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:40.320]  into their gardens, the plants suck it up
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.320]  and they recycle these 60 minerals
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:44.320]  over and over and over
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:46.320]  we get NPK fertilizer
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:48.320]  so we get two minerals, the plants are happy
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:50.320]  but we need 60
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:52.320]  so if you're eating a pretty good slice
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.320]  of multigrain bread, baked with love
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:56.320]  in the church by the pastor's wife on Sunday
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:58.320]  you're 58 mineral short
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:00.320]  and this is our problem
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:02.320]  and doctors of course have told everybody
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:04.320]  oh don't worry about supplementation
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:06.320]  just eat well and you get everything you need
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:08.320]  in your food plate
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:10.320]  and that's all the big lie
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:12.320]  to get you into the position where you eat
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:14.320]  and it's so simple, the old fashioned
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:16.320]  you know like in Germany or anywhere
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:18.320]  where you put all the animal and human waste
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:20.320]  and big honey pots
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:22.320]  let it ferment for a year
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:24.320]  to all the bacteria eating through it and died
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:26.320]  now it's pure minerals
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:28.320]  and vitamins and you name it
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:30.320]  you put that on the crop
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:32.320]  it's a totally different food
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:34.320]  than the chemical fertilizer
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:36.320]  that they're dumping and that we're then eating
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:38.320]  and then they spray the crops with sodium fluoride
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.320]  which then bio accumulates
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:42.320]  even worse
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:44.320]  it's a toxic brew
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:46.320]  we're exactly right
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.320]  and of course we have to be smarter
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:50.320]  and again that's why I applaud you for
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:52.320]  getting this information in front of the American people
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:54.320]  again
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:56.320]  it's to the government's advantage
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:58.320]  to keep the doctors happy because
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:00.320]  they put more money into the PAC committees
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:02.320]  than any other group
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:04.320]  it's just a little love thing
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.320]  between the doctors and the government
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:08.320]  and so we have to save ourselves
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:10.320]  and this is what my wife and I have done
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:12.320]  with the books Lesley Doctor, Lesley Herbal Doctor
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:14.320]  and the Passport Rheumatherapy
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:16.320]  to teach people how to deal with over 900
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:18.320]  different diseases using just
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:20.320]  vitamins and minerals and trade minerals
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:22.320]  and rare earths and amino acids and fatty acids
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:24.320]  and herbs just like we use in animals
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:26.320]  and it works in people Alex just like
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:28.320]  a dozen animals
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:30.320]  there's no reason why we should be treating our dogs
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:32.320]  better than we treat our kids
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:34.320]  it's just amazing to me that people put up with that
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.320]  when you look at it
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:38.320]  we kill so many people in hospitals
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:40.320]  nobody would go on an airliner
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:42.320]  if the airlines were to kill that many people
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:44.320]  oh new numbers just came out on that
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:46.320]  I want to come back and show viewers the graphic
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:48.320]  read it to listeners
[01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:50.320]  the FDA admits they're killing at least 100,000 a year
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:52.320]  we're on the march
[01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:54.320]  the empire's on the run

[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:37.320]  this filter system leaves in beneficial minerals
[01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:38.320]  which is key
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:40.320]  save money by not buying bottled water

[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:10.320]  eternal hostility against every form of tyranny
[01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:12.320]  over the mind of man
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:14.320]  Thomas Jefferson
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:43.320]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:46.320]  Dr. Joel Wallach is on a quest
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:49.320]  there is no doubt he knows the truth of what he's discovered
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:52.320]  something hiding in plain view in veterinary science
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:54.320]  he's a veterinarian amongst other doctorates
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:59.320]  and he's done major studies for the federal government
[01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:01.320]  conducted tens of thousands of autopsies
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:03.320]  with huge programs underneath him
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:06.320]  to confirm these findings
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:08.320]  all these degenerative diseases
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:10.320]  neurological you name it
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:12.320]  are increasing and they spend it
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:13.320]  well it's genetic
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:16.320]  well yeah you can be predisposed to something
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:18.320]  but when you're missing the minerals
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:20.320]  and the vitamins and the trace elements
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:22.320]  all working together in concert
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:24.320]  you're starving to death
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:28.320]  and I see old people everywhere
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:30.320]  who have the big sores
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:31.320]  they're skin rotting
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:32.320]  they touch a door
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:34.320]  their skin rips open
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:37.320]  and I talked to people like Ted Anderson's dad
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:39.320]  Ted's told this story
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:42.320]  six months on Beyond Tany Tangerine
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:43.320]  an essential fatty acid

[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:47.320]  that young Jevity has developed

[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:52.320]  you get discounts and make this whole radio transmission possible
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:55.320]  but that's a side issue to you getting empowered
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:57.320]  and the sores went away
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:59.320]  his memory came back
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.320]  he was back it was like a movie
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:03.320]  it was like Planet of the Apes
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:05.320]  the latest edition of it
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:07.320]  which is by an excellent movie by the way
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:10.320]  where they inject the guy with the serum vaccine
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:12.320]  and it reverses the Alzheimer's
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.320]  well this was just with minerals and vitamins
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:16.320]  and the doctor tested his blood
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:17.320]  said you're vitamin K
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:20.320]  what are you doing while I'm taking these supplements
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:22.320]  well you can't have that
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:24.320]  they're telling you vitamins are bad now
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:27.320]  and you know what again I hate to promote stuff on the back of that
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:29.320]  but Ted wants me to tell the story
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:30.320]  because the doctor said no
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:31.320]  the doctor is God
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:32.320]  that's the end of it
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:36.320]  can't promote young Jevity products to him
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:37.320]  and I see these people
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:40.320]  and I've studied naval warfare
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:42.320]  it was kind of a hobby to study the history of that
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:43.320]  a little bit in history books
[01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:45.320]  very entertaining
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:46.320]  and scurvy was such a big problem
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:48.320]  I know I talk about this a lot
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:50.320]  but I go look at these old people
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:51.320]  their teeth falling out
[01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:52.320]  sores all over them
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:54.320]  they're hardly eating
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:56.320]  they're eating processed crud
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:57.320]  and they're starving to death
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:59.320]  and I'm so sick of watching this
[01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:02.320]  so yes start your own garden
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:05.320]  yes start getting raw eggs from a local farmer like I do
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:08.320]  and again you can start reversing it
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:09.320]  my brain works better
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:10.320]  I feel better
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:12.320]  my children behave better
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:14.320]  my wife has had amazing results
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:18.320]  I know women who've had their hair falling out
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:20.320]  got on beyond Tangy Tangerine
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:22.320]  pollen bursts on their products
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:23.320]  their hair came back
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:28.320]  it is amazing because people are starving to death
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:31.320]  so I do challenge you to go to mfolwarsteam.com
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:34.320]  and get beyond Tangy Tangerine
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:36.320]  get the pollen burst
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:38.320]  get the alex pack
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:41.320]  that's got all the other great products in it
[01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:42.320]  it's all available
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:44.320]  and get on this journey with us
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:45.320]  but I'm done plugging that
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:47.320]  I got to let all the other callers go
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:49.320]  I apologize because they were on other subjects
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:51.320]  I want to open the phones up right now
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:53.320]  for our guest Dr. Joel Wallach
[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:57.320]  so people can call in with their specific questions
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:01.320]  800-259-9231
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:04.320]  800-259-9231
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:06.320]  and the jam-packed hour coming up
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:08.320]  on the economy, the police state
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:10.320]  and your phone calls as well in the next hour
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:12.320]  but Dr. Wallach
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:13.320]  going through things
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:15.320]  I wanted to ask you about this
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:18.320]  I was in a CVS
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:21.320]  a few days ago getting some batteries
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:23.320]  by my house
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:26.320]  and I watched as children came up
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:28.320]  and we're all getting gum
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:29.320]  and every gum in there
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:31.320]  like 30 or 40 right there at the front counter
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:33.320]  had aspartame
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:35.320]  and I know that aspartame breaks into what alcohol
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:39.320]  I know it's also addictive as many poisonings are
[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:42.320]  I understand that people get to where they absolutely need it
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:44.320]  that's why they put it in there so it's addictive
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:48.320]  it is the feces of a genetically engineered E. coli bacteria
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:50.320]  in bio weapons development in the 60s
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:51.320]  they got it approved
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:54.320]  obviously in 1981
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:56.320]  and I start telling people
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:58.320]  hey ma'am I noticed you're buying your son that
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:00.320]  you need to get in your business but that has what alcohol in it
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:02.320]  that's what aspartame is
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:04.320]  and they start laughing at me and I go it's feces
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:06.320]  of a bacteria and my son goes
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:08.320]  yes it's in the manufacturing process
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:10.320]  and the woman gets mad at me and runs out of the building
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:12.320]  but I don't care
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:14.320]  if I see children buying it
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:16.320]  I must tell them it's rat poison
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:18.320]  and the people behind the counter know who I am
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:19.320]  so they're laughing
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:21.320]  but it's not funny
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:23.320]  I've seen major studies
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:26.320]  admitting that degeneration
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:29.320]  macular degeneration
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:32.320]  all these other problems
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:34.320]  are directly connected to aspartame
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:36.320]  being in tens of thousands of products now
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:37.320]  it's in sugar candy
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:38.320]  it's in processed foods
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:39.320]  it's everywhere
[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:42.320]  they're assaulting us with it
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:43.320]  an example of that
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:45.320]  what is aspartame doing there
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:48.320]  and what can be done with nutritional things
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:50.320]  to reverse things in the eyes
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:52.320]  or at least stop the damage
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:54.320]  I know sometimes you're too far down the rat hole
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:56.320]  I mean my point is this
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:58.320]  this is what I'm getting at
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:01.320]  we all know beta carotene increases night vision
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:03.320]  and things like that
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:05.320]  we all know that
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:06.320]  well my family
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:07.320]  my children now beg
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:09.320]  for the essential fatty acids
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:11.320]  they don't even like the candy flavored vitamins
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:12.320]  that we used to give them
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:13.320]  now at first they didn't like
[01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:14.320]  beyond tangy tangerine
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:16.320]  now that their body knows what it is
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:17.320]  they beg for it
[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:20.320]  they beg for their big horse pill
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:23.320]  essential fatty acids with your picture on it
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:25.320]  they were all eating them this morning
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:26.320]  their brain has figured out
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:27.320]  and they said
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:30.320]  it makes us feel really good
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:31.320]  so again
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:32.320]  what's going on with the eyes
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:34.320]  because I know that's epidemic
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:35.320]  eyes degenerating
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:37.320]  what's happening there
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:40.320]  well again you're very perceptive Alex
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:43.320]  macular degeneration is the most common cause
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:44.320]  blindness in adults
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:46.320]  and it's very seductive
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:47.320]  because as you point out
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:50.320]  aspartame other sugar alcohols
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:53.320]  manateaus and that kind of stuff
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:55.320]  these things actually
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:56.320]  make the body think
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:58.320]  that you're getting what you need
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:39:59.320]  when we're mentally deficient
[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:00.320]  we have cravings
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:01.320]  we call them the munchies
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:03.320]  your body's looking for something
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:05.320]  and to me the thing that
[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:07.320]  aspartame other alcohol sugars
[01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:08.320]  or sugar alcohols
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:10.320]  and these artificial sweeteners
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:11.320]  they make the body think
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:13.320]  you're getting what it's looking for
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:14.320]  and you keep going down
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:16.320]  that rat hole you were talking about
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:18.320]  and we can actually reverse
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:20.320]  I can take people who have been legally blind
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:23.320]  rendered legally blind by macular degeneration
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:25.320]  for 8, 10, 12 years
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:27.320]  and in 90 days get them to read
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:28.320]  2020 without glasses
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:30.320]  I don't care if they're 85 years old
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:32.320]  we do this all the time
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:34.320]  and it's become quite
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:35.320]  we actually have eye doctors
[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:36.320]  now send us people
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:38.320]  because we can do these things
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:39.320]  what we do is we actually
[01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:40.320]  give the nutrients
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:42.320]  as you point out the 90 for life
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:45.320]  the Alex pack is really great
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:47.320]  that you adopted this program
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:48.320]  the Alex pack
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:50.320]  but Doc what's happening in the eye
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:52.320]  with the sugar alcohols
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:54.320]  what are they doing specifically
[01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:55.320]  because I want to speak to that
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:57.320]  I mean how can people
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:59.320]  as pharmacist Ben Fuchs said
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:02.320]  stopped or in some cases reversed it
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:04.320]  I mean obviously if you're born blind
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:05.320]  or other genetic things
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:07.320]  but I mean what's happening
[01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:08.320]  in macular degeneration
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:10.320]  we know the eye needs beta carotene
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:11.320]  what else does it need
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:12.320]  why are we seeing
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:15.320]  the epidemic of eye problems
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:17.320]  well your eye needs all 90% of nutrients
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:18.320]  just like your liver and your heart
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:19.320]  and your kidneys
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:20.320]  and your brain and your skin
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:21.320]  and your bones and your cartilage
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:23.320]  every tissue in your body
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:24.320]  needs all 90% of nutrients
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:25.320]  so do your eyes
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:26.320]  the retina of your eye
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:27.320]  to function properly
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:29.320]  take pictures
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:30.320]  and transmit them to the brain
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:31.320]  and turn it into something
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:32.320]  you can visualize
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:34.320]  now what happens is
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:36.320]  when you get oxidative damage
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:38.320]  to the retina of the eye
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:40.320]  it's actually the easiest way
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:42.320]  I think to explain it is liver spots
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:43.320]  you've all seen liver spots
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:45.320]  on the older person's back
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:46.320]  of their hands
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:47.320]  and their face
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:49.320]  the same thing is happening
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:50.320]  to the retina of your eye
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:51.320]  and light can't get through there
[01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:53.320]  and again beta carotene
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:55.320]  is a great antioxidant
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:56.320]  obviously one of the oldest ones
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:57.320]  is one of the first
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:41:59.320]  fat soluble vitamins
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:00.320]  that were recognized
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:02.320]  and it's one of the greatest
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:03.320]  antioxidants
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:05.320]  it prevents oxidative damage
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:07.320]  and of course when you get things
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:09.320]  like aspartame
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:11.320]  it is used to
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:14.320]  make things that are
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:15.320]  oxidative
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:17.320]  in other words cause free radical damage
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:18.320]  taste good
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:20.320]  so it's kind of a screen
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:22.320]  for things that are bad for you
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:24.320]  that makes it taste good
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:25.320]  so you're willing to take in things
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:27.320]  that actually cause the oxidative damage
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:28.320]  cause liver spots
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:30.320]  and age spots in your retina
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:32.320]  and the bad taste of the bad things
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:34.320]  is masked by the sweet flavor
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:35.320]  so that's what it is
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:37.320]  it's literally crud
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:38.320]  building up in the eye
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:40.320]  basically to put it in the layman's terms
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:41.320]  and you know
[01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:42.320]  oh ok
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:43.320]  this is amazing
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:44.320]  I love the sun
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:45.320]  I mean I love
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:46.320]  to go out
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:47.320]  and go fishing
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:49.320]  or go hiking with my shirt off
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:50.320]  but until I started
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:51.320]  really using engevity intensely
[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:52.320]  about six months ago
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:53.320]  it was back in November
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:55.320]  so however long ago that was
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:57.320]  I guess about seven months ago now
[01:42:57.320 --> 01:43:00.320]  I would get big brown spots
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:01.320]  all over my face
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:02.320]  freckles
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:03.320]  obviously my body's trying
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:04.320]  to defend me from the sun
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:05.320]  I've noticed now
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:06.320]  I'm getting even more sun
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:08.320]  but because I've been taking engevity
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:10.320]  I have about half the freckles
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:11.320]  I did before
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:13.320]  I used to go out in the sun
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:14.320]  the next day
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:15.320]  bigger freckles
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:16.320]  brown spots all over my face
[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:17.320]  my wife's like
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:18.320]  you look like a cheetah
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:20.320]  what's happening there
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:21.320]  because I've heard pharmacists
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:22.320]  been fuchs talk about the fact
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:23.320]  that when you're not getting
[01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:25.320]  the vitamins and minerals you need
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:26.320]  you sunburn worse
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:27.320]  and you have problems
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:29.320]  what's happening there
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:30.320]  well exactly
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:31.320]  Alex
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:33.320]  these are reversible
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:34.320]  you take in the antioxidants
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:35.320]  like beta carotene
[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:36.320]  you take in
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:38.320]  and the beyond tain tangerine
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:41.320]  the powder has 115 super juices in it
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:42.320]  you know everybody knows
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:44.320]  about noni and mangosteen
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:45.320]  and these types of things
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:46.320]  and ascii berry
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:47.320]  well this has 115
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:48.320]  not 3, not 10
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:51.320]  but 115 of these super juices
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:52.320]  in this one product
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:54.320]  and these are part of the secret
[01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:56.320]  of these top 20 longevity cultures
[01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:57.320]  this is where all these super juices
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:58.320]  came from
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:43:59.320]  from these peoples
[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:01.320]  and scientists and anthropologists
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:02.320]  said well this is part
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:03.320]  of their longevity secret
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:04.320]  which is quite true
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:06.320]  but only one part of the recipe
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:07.320]  and so we installed
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:09.320]  115 of these super juices
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:10.320]  in this one product
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:12.320]  along with 130 vitamins
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:13.320]  and minerals and amino acids
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:14.320]  and fatty acids
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:16.320]  in the Alex pack
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:18.320]  this is why we're able to shrink
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:20.320]  and eliminate
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:21.320]  age spots and liver spots
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:22.320]  when you have 10 of them
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:23.320]  on your skin
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:24.320]  you have a million of them
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:25.320]  in your brain
[01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:27.320]  and of course doctors love it
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:28.320]  when you have Alzheimer's disease
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:29.320]  because they bought up all the
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:31.320]  rehab centers
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:32.320]  they bought up all the
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:34.320]  hospitals
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:35.320]  and so we
[01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:36.320]  well that takes me back to the
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:37.320]  what is it where I see
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:38.320]  old people everywhere
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:39.320]  even folks that are like
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:40.320]  65, 70
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:42.320]  with rotholes in their skin
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:44.320]  and their skin gets paper thin
[01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:45.320]  I mean from the descriptions
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:46.320]  I've read that's like scurvy
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:48.320]  isn't it
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:49.320]  well exactly right
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:51.320]  scurvy attacks the connective tissue
[01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:53.320]  including your skin, your gums
[01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:55.320]  and the doctors won't teach
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:56.320]  nutrition now so they won't
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:58.320]  tell you you've got scurvy
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:00.320]  well they don't even know it
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:01.320]  they're so ignorant
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:02.320]  they don't even know it Alex
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:03.320]  I wouldn't even give them credit
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:04.320]  to know that they
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:05.320]  they're withholding it
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:06.320]  they're just so ignorant
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:07.320]  they don't even know it
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:08.320]  in fact
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:09.320]  Alzheimer's disease
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:11.320]  is a physician-caused disease
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:12.320]  didn't exist 40 years ago
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:14.320]  it's a physician-caused disease
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:15.320]  because they've given us
[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:16.320]  these statin drugs
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:17.320]  they'll lower cholesterol
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:19.320]  and your brain is 75%
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:21.320]  by weight cholesterol
[01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:23.320]  so you go on a cholesterol restricted diet
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:24.320]  they made egg beaters
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:26.320]  for baby boomers
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:27.320]  you eat egg beaters
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:29.320]  you take cholesterol lowering drugs
[01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:30.320]  you're going to get
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:32.320]  Alzheimer's disease like
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:33.320]  what's her name? Pat Summit
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:35.320]  you know the winningest basketball coach ever
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:37.320]  she had to have a good brain for that
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:39.320]  and they gave her Alzheimer's disease
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:41.320]  by giving her statin drugs
[01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:43.320]  well my dad is a dentist
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:45.320]  but he took biology and college and things
[01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:46.320]  and 10 years ago
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:47.320]  he was showing me studies
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:48.320]  that they knew
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:49.320]  statins were literally
[01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:51.320]  disintegrating people's brains
[01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:53.320]  he got my grandmother to go off of them
[01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:54.320]  I'm a mom's mom
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:57.320]  and she was never
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:45:58.320]  she was always real sharp
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:00.320]  but she certainly
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:01.320]  I could tell the difference
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:02.320]  when she got off of it
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:03.320]  she had more energy
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:05.320]  but now the new literature admits
[01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:07.320]  it's destroying people's brains
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:10.320]  it's just incredible
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:11.320]  Exactly
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:12.320]  the FDA came out
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:13.320]  just a couple of weeks ago
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:15.320]  and said that statin drugs
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:16.320]  it's a new warning
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:17.320]  they said statin drugs
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:19.320]  actually increases your risk
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:20.320]  of Alzheimer's disease
[01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:21.320]  and increases your risk
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:24.320]  of type 2 diabetes by 50%
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:26.320]  and there was not a single doctor in America
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:28.320]  Alex, not one single doctor in America
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:29.320]  except me
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:30.320]  that sent out an email to everybody
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:32.320]  said get off of statin drugs
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:33.320]  every other doctor
[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:34.320]  just sort of hunkered down
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:35.320]  and hoped their patients
[01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:37.320]  didn't see it or hear it
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:39.320]  well also Dr. Russell Blalock
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:41.320]  is a retired top brain surgeon
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:42.320]  he just says it's criminal
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:45.320]  he says statins are criminal
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:47.320]  well I agree with him 100%
[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:48.320]  and I can't thank you enough
[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:49.320]  for getting this out
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:50.320]  to the American people
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:51.320]  because it's going to take
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:53.320]  individuals like yourself
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:54.320]  and your crew
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:57.320]  on InfoWarsTeam.com
[01:46:57.320 --> 01:46:58.320]  to save America
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:46:59.320]  we need saving here
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:02.320]  and so I'm glad to be part of your army
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:03.320]  Absolutely
[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:04.320]  and you know it's a win-win-win
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:05.320]  because we can get you on
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:08.320]  to break down just all these facts
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:09.320]  and at the same time
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:10.320]  we can also then support
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:12.320]  this independent news organization
[01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:13.320]  when people support us
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:15.320]  at InfoWarsTeam.com
[01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:17.320]  let's go ahead and take some calls here
[01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:18.320]  who's been holding the longest
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:19.320]  Bill in Ohio
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:20.320]  you're on the air
[01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:23.320]  but Dr. Joel Wallach go ahead
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:25.320]  Hey Alex, appreciate it
[01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:26.320]  Hi Dr. Wallach
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:28.320]  I just wanted to ask
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:29.320]  my wife is pregnant
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:32.320]  and we're on the Biontini tangerine
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:34.320]  and the essential fatty acids
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:35.320]  but I'm wondering if there's
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:37.320]  anything else we should be doing
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:39.320]  Okay, good question
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:41.320]  and how far along is she?
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:43.320]  About four months
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:45.320]  Well congratulations
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:47.320]  yeah, if she plans on breastfeeding the baby
[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:49.320]  I would add the osteo FX plus
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:51.320]  and so that's where the Alex pack
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:52.320]  would come in
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:53.320]  it has the Biontini tangerine
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:55.320]  the osteo FX plus
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:56.320]  and the EFA plus
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:58.320]  which are the omega-3s
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:47:59.320]  and the Alex pack
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:00.320]  is the most economical
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:02.320]  best functional way to do it
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:04.320]  it deals with 100 pounds of human flesh
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:06.320]  one pack is good for 100 pounds
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:07.320]  of human flesh
[01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:09.320]  so if you use it for a 50 pound kid
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:10.320]  that's a two month supply
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:13.320]  if you give it to a 200 pound person
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:15.320]  regardless of gender
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:16.320]  that's a two week supply
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:18.320]  so it goes by body weight
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:19.320]  That's another question I have
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:20.320]  What is this I'm seeing
[01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:22.320]  record numbers of women miscarrying
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:24.320]  and then I was reading that the
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:26.320]  the pharmacies
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:28.320]  what do you call the pharmacies doctor
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:30.320]  where they take the old fashioned
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:32.320]  things and actually prepare it there
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:34.320]  and compounding pharmacies
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:36.320]  Yes, yes, a compounding pharmacy
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:38.320]  and of course these are run by medical doctors
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:39.320]  and I was reading how they have this
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:41.320]  hormone they give women naturally
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:43.320]  where it's stopping women having the miscarriage
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:44.320]  and it's working
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:46.320]  but the feds are coming in
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:48.320]  and trying to stop them from doing it
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:50.320]  I mean what's happening there
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:52.320]  Well when women have miscarriages
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:54.320]  almost always I'd say about 99%
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:56.320]  of the time they're malnourished
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:58.320]  they don't have enough vitamins and minerals
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:48:59.320]  they have enough calories
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:00.320]  they have enough protein maybe
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:02.320]  but they don't have enough vitamins and minerals
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:04.320]  and there's another little piece in there
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:06.320]  I don't know how many people
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:07.320]  know this out there
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:09.320]  but Mayo Clinic came out with a report
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:12.320]  in 2009 that said 30% of Americans
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:14.320]  are gluten intolerant
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:16.320]  when you're gluten intolerant Alex
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:18.320]  intestines look like you've been eating
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:20.320]  poison ivy for salads
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:22.320]  it is ugly and you cannot absorb nutrients
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:24.320]  even if you're supplementing with them
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:26.320]  and this is what's causing all the miscarriages
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:29.320]  because people are told to eat more whole grains
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:31.320]  and human beings are never really meant to eat
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:33.320]  whole grains that's why we're the number one
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:34.320]  obese nation in the world
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:36.320]  And then isn't that also linked
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:38.320]  the gut being inflamed to the increase
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:40.320]  in colon cancer
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:42.320]  You got it
[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:44.320]  Exactly, again you're very perceptive
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:46.320]  the process meets with nitrates
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:48.320]  nitrites, the fried foods, the oils
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:50.320]  and then you throw in the mix
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:52.320]  the gluten from the gluten intolerance
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:54.320]  from wheat barley rower oats
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:56.320]  I mean you don't have to give up beer because you've got
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:58.320]  these gluten free beers
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:00.320]  by Anheuser-Busch
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:02.320]  you got the rice beers from the Orientals
[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:04.320]  my wife is Chinese
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:06.320]  so if I drink beer it's the rice beer
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:08.320]  and I'm telling you
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:10.320]  if we stay away from all these
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:12.320]  these whole grains it's the wheat
[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:14.320]  and you know about the GMO stuff
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:16.320]  you throw in the GMO factor to whole grains
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:18.320]  you are in big trouble
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:20.320]  Absolutely
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:22.320]  thank you Coll, we're going to go to Brighton and come back
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:24.320]  and talk to
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:26.320]  Teeny
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:28.320]  Scott
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:30.320]  Marilyn, Vanessa and Chris
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:32.320]  in this next segment, the next short segment
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:34.320]  and then I'm going to get into
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:36.320]  Pistoli, Mr. Pistol
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:38.320]  TSA
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:40.320]  Gropers being trained to specifically target your crotch
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:42.320]  you can't make that up
[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:44.320]  also we're going to get into
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:46.320]  Obama going after the churches
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:48.320]  so they've got to pay for abortions, birth control
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:50.320]  and hire people that aren't Christians
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:52.320]  Feds have no jurisdiction
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:54.320]  in churches folks, we're in the First Amendment
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:56.320]  we're going to get into a bunch of news coming up after
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:58.320]  the doc leaves us, infowarsteam.com
[01:50:58.320 --> 01:51:10.320]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:14.320]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:18.320]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country
[01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:20.320]  and it's possible that could even happen again
[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:22.320]  so our friends at Solutions from Science
[01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:24.320]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:26.320]  they call it a survival seed bank

[01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:25.320]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:31.320]  at the beginning of the month my husband was diagnosed with a glioblastoma tumor in his brain
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:34.320]  about the size of a baseball
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:37.320]  he was in the hospital for about a week
[01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:41.320]  and he was home and they wanted to do seed treatment on him
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:44.320]  but he refused to do that, any of their treatment
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:50.320]  so we got on your site Alex and we ordered the brain and heart pack
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:53.320]  and it came yesterday and we started taking that
[01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:56.320]  then we also got a hold of Dr. Glidden
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:55:00.320]  and he ordered us a bunch of other stuff to go along with that
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:04.320]  so my husband's been taking it since about 4 o'clock last night
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:07.320]  and then again around 11 o'clock last night
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:09.320]  and then again this morning and then again this afternoon
[01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:13.320]  and he's already got more energy
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:15.320]  well who knows what's gonna happen with a tumor that size
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:17.320]  but we'll definitely pray for him
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:20.320]  all I know is that the brain is made up
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:23.320]  the solid part mainly about a cholesterol
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:27.320]  and they know full well that these statin drugs are destroying people
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:33.320]  but my goodness, wow, a tumor the size of a baseball
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:36.320]  let's go ahead and talk to Chris in mass
[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:39.320]  you're on the air with Dr. Wallet, go ahead
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:41.320]  hey guys, how are ya?
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:42.320]  good, go ahead
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:44.320]  it breaks my heart to hear that last call
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:47.320]  my father-in-law just died a few months ago
[01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:51.320]  with a cleoplastoma so my prayers definitely go out to that last caller
[01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:54.320]  by the way, a lot of brain tumors are up because of the cell phones
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:55.320]  sorry, go ahead
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:57.320]  yeah, I know, I know
[01:55:57.320 --> 01:56:01.320]  so I have a comment real quick and a question for Dr. Wallet
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:06.320]  my comment is they started using the Alex Pack about two months ago
[01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:10.320]  and I'm a singer-songwriter who's constantly gigging all the time
[01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:12.320]  and I'm also a hockey coach
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:16.320]  I'm always staying in good shape but I could never get below 200 pounds
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:22.320]  and I started taking the Alex Pack and I swear to God in two months I've lost 25 pounds
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:26.320]  and see, it's never even been advertised as weight loss
[01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:30.320]  but that's what we've discovered and that's what happened with Aaron
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:34.320]  is that you're starving and now it can be midnight, I'm working, I'm really hungry
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:38.320]  and I go bam, tangy tangerine and boom
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:45.320]  I mean, I go to bed, I feel great because my body got what it needed, Dr. Wallet
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:48.320]  you're exactly right, when you have cravings, when you're hungry
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:51.320]  your body's really looking for nutrients, not more calories
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:56.320]  so when you use the Alex Pack, when you use the tangy tangerine instead of a soft drink
[01:56:56.320 --> 01:57:00.320]  instead of a cookie, you will lose weight and you'll be healthier
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:05.320]  it's amazing, wow, so you've lost 20 plus pounds in a couple months
[01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:10.320]  I'm performing all the time, I performed at Liberty Love Fest
[01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:15.320]  Ron Paul event just a couple months ago and I'm always active, I'm always working out
[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:18.320]  I could never get below 200 pounds as soon as I...
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:23.320]  Hey, that's cool, tell folks about your music or what you're doing, tell folks about your website
[01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:28.320]  Sure, it's ChrisRossMusic.com, you can find me on Facebook
[01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:33.320]  my Twitter is ChrisRossMusic, I actually perform at Jordan Page and a few other artists
[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:37.320]  That's exciting because listen, listen, I knew Young Jevvie was good folks
[01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:40.320]  and I started getting into it over a year ago but I was barely promoting
[01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:43.320]  because I'm like, yeah, it's good, you need the minerals, yeah, okay, here it is
[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:46.320]  and I told everybody else, no, with nutritional stuff
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:48.320]  and I'm like, yeah, okay, this looks good, I'll promote this
[01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:51.320]  but when I saw Erin, and then my wife, and then my mother
[01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:54.320]  and all this stuff, I finally did it and boom, had a big effect
[01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:58.320]  but I gotta be honest, Dr. Wallach, I've lost 40 plus pounds
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:01.320]  but now it's stopped and of course that's nothing to complain about
[01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:04.320]  and I'm not working out as much because I'm working too much
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:07.320]  and I guess I've just got to work out as much as I was
[01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:09.320]  I was working out the same amount and not losing weight
[01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:12.320]  then I started doing Tangy Tangerine and all this lost a bunch of weight
[01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:15.320]  but now I've kind of cut back, I guess I've answered my own question
[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:19.320]  I need to go back to working out or how do I lose more weight?
[01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:22.320]  Okay, there's two ways, number one, you could take more minerals
[01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:26.320]  just add a bottle of plain minerals or cherry mints to your regimen
[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:29.320]  take two ounces of that a day, be two quarters a month
[01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:33.320]  or we have what we call ASAP as slim as possible
[01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:37.320]  so actually you can put a dropper full under your tongue 30 minutes before which you can
[01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:39.320]  Now you shall all right it, stay there, tell me more about that

[02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:17.320]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:20.320]  and now live from Austin, Texas
[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:22.320]  Alex Jones
[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:30.320]  Dr. Wallace with us for five more minutes
[02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:34.320]  and then I'm going to come back in news blitz and take your phone calls
[02:00:34.320 --> 02:00:39.320]  Let's go ahead and talk to Vanessa in Oregon, you're on the air with Dr. Wallace
[02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:42.320]  Hello, I've had since I was 14 years old
[02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:46.320]  digestive problems like at 14 I stopped being able to
[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:49.320]  dairy some fruits, vegetables
[02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:51.320]  basically I could only eat bread and rice
[02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:54.320]  and I still to this day I can't eat a full meal
[02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:57.320]  it's horrible and I was wondering if you had any ideas about that
[02:00:58.320 --> 02:01:02.320]  Do you have any skin problems like eczema, dermatitis, psoriasis?
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:06.320]  I just started getting psoriasis a bit
[02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:10.320]  Do you have any history of chronic bronchitis or asthma as a kid?
[02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:12.320]  No
[02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:15.320]  Do you have constipation or diarrhea?
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:18.320]  Sometimes
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:21.320]  Of course, it goes along with the psoriasis thing
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:23.320]  You have gluten intolerance
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:26.320]  What I'd have you do, if you're going to eat bread it's got to be gluten free bread
[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:29.320]  You cannot have wheat barley rower oats in any form
[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:32.320]  No oatmeal for breakfast, no cereals
[02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:35.320]  None of that kind of stuff, no wheat barley rower oats
[02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:38.320]  You can have rice, you can have baked sweet potatoes with butter
[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:41.320]  You can have squash with butter, you can have all the vegetables
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:44.320]  Make sure no processed meats, because not only do they have nitrates in them
[02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:47.320]  but they also have wheat in them as filler
[02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:50.320]  No wheat barley rower oats should take the Alex pack appropriate for body weight
[02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:53.320]  One Alex pack per month for 100 pounds of body weight
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:56.320]  You will be a new woman, the psoriasis goes away
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:59.320]  And guess what, no more diarrhea, no more constipation
[02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:01.320]  You will be a new woman
[02:02:01.320 --> 02:02:04.320]  Alex, I had one question for you
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:07.320]  I'm a hardcore info warrior, always doing my research every single day
[02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:10.320]  And I just started the blog and I was wondering if I could
[02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:14.320]  And by females especially, because I don't know a lot of female info warriors
[02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:16.320]  that are way into it, to contribute
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:20.320]  And in guys as well, if you have any sort of writing or art
[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:23.320]  or anything you'd like to contribute, I would love that
[02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:28.320]  We are going to tomorrow launch officially the big social network
[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:33.320]  where you can link and post your artwork, your articles, everything
[02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:37.320]  And we absolutely want to get women more involved in the info war
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:42.320]  And I'm getting some reporters together to start doing daily shows
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:45.320]  that will kind of host like a Washington Journal show
[02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:49.320]  where people can call in and just call after call after call
[02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:51.320]  and just go over news that way
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:54.320]  Earlier I had a bunch of great callers holding and I had to let them go
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:56.320]  so you guys could get on with medical questions
[02:02:56.320 --> 02:02:59.320]  That way, I've got a bunch of shows I want to launch
[02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:01.320]  I've got a bunch of reporters we're trying to hire
[02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:04.320]  We've just gotten to that final level of growth
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:07.320]  where we're about to be able to hire more people and do it all
[02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:09.320]  but it's also a money issue
[02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:12.320]  And so what I do is I promote products that I believe in
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:15.320]  that help people, that also finance our operation
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:18.320]  I believe in win-win, that's why I sleep so good at night
[02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:21.320]  I promote young Jebedy via infowarstein.com
[02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:24.320]  So yes, we are wanting to empower women, God bless you
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:27.320]  Let's talk to Marilyn in Texas
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:29.320]  Go ahead, you're on the air with Dr. Wallach
[02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:31.320]  Thank you so much, Dr. Wallach
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:35.320]  I'm calling about my husband who's had chronic diarrhea
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:38.320]  for about three months, going on four
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:40.320]  He has abdominal pain after he eats
[02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:44.320]  He has headaches at the back of his head and vertigo
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:49.320]  and we've gone through blood tests, even an ultrasound of his abdomen
[02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:51.320]  and everything is normal
[02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:55.320]  that he's getting weaker, he's lost more than 11 pounds
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:04:00.320]  Okay, that's very good because he eliminated cancer and other evil things, right?
[02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:04.320]  So if they've done all these tests, believe me
[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:08.320]  if there's anything remotely looks like cancer, doctors are going to glom onto it
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:10.320]  So what I would do is get him on a gluten-free diet
[02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:13.320]  and if you go back to when he was a kid, ask him if he has appendix out
[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:15.320]  Do you know?
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:16.320]  No, he hasn't
[02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:18.320]  Did he have his gallbladder out?
[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:20.320]  No, he's got one
[02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:23.320]  Did he have asthma?
[02:04:23.320 --> 02:04:24.320]  No
[02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:25.320]  Okay
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:27.320]  I would get him on a gluten-free diet
[02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:29.320]  No wheat, barley, rye, oats
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:31.320]  That means oatmeal for breakfast
[02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:35.320]  and things like processed meats that are filled with...
[02:04:35.320 --> 02:04:37.320]  He's got to go on a total health food diet
[02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:39.320]  and he's got to...
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:41.320]  I mean, as Dr. Wallach was just saying
[02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:44.320]  he's got to not eat GMO too
[02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:46.320]  A lot of this is GMO, this is what it does to the rats and things
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:48.320]  Dr. Wallach, incredible job
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:50.320]  I look forward to having you back up soon
[02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:53.320]  in FullWarsTeam.com if people want to find out more
[02:04:53.320 --> 02:04:55.320]  and they also have a number you can call

[02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:29.320]  The problem
[02:05:29.320 --> 02:05:30.320]  Number 4
[02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:32.320]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:35.320]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[02:05:35.320 --> 02:05:36.320]  from weather-related onages
[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:37.320]  Number 5
[02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:40.320]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:41.320]  and peace of mind
[02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:43.320]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators

[02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:33.320]  Again, thank you so much for tuning in today
[02:08:33.320 --> 02:08:37.320]  Look, people look for silver bullet solutions
[02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:40.320]  Something simple, you know, arrest David Rockefeller
[02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:43.320]  arrest the Queen of England, everything will be okay
[02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:47.320]  Those are just figureheads on institutions of corruption
[02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:50.320]  You only see a tiny bit of the iceberg
[02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:53.320]  It is a philosophy of liberty
[02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:57.320]  and populations that will not go along to get along
[02:08:57.320 --> 02:09:00.320]  who will resist tyranny
[02:09:00.320 --> 02:09:02.320]  by speaking out against it
[02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:05.320]  by not giving your consent
[02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:07.320]  by exposing it, by getting noisy
[02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:10.320]  by not being spectators
[02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:13.320]  I was looking at the state laws
[02:09:13.320 --> 02:09:17.320]  Most states have already thrown out the laws they had previously
[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:19.320]  or watered them down
[02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:22.320]  They could literally just take any money they wanted out of your car
[02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:24.320]  and say it was associated with drugs
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:27.320]  the point of they were doing it to even old ladies
[02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:29.320]  and reached so far that they reversed it
[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:32.320]  but a lot of states still have it in place
[02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:37.320]  like Tennessee, New Jersey, Kentucky, there's quite a few
[02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:41.320]  and it's now gotten to the point where every day
[02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:44.320]  I'm reading about police even grabbing a thousand dollars
[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:46.320]  out of somebody's purse when they pull them over
[02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:49.320]  or in the case of Michigan saying give me your cell phone
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:51.320]  you hand the cop your cell phone
[02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:54.320]  they plug it into a machine and download all the contents
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:56.320]  photos, everything
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:09:59.320]  or they have wireless systems that grab it off
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:00.320]  Google's been caught doing that
[02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:02.320]  that's flagrantly illegal
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:05.320]  but they just do it and the idea is well we're the good guys
[02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:06.320]  so it's okay
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:08.320]  really are you the good guys in history?
[02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:11.320]  Our founders said keep government on a short leash
[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:13.320]  or you're gonna end up in hell
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:15.320]  I don't care how many excuses there are
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:22.320]  so my point on this issue is the tyrants are arrogant right now
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:23.320]  they know some of us are waking up
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:25.320]  so they want to finish their program up
[02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:27.320]  but a lot of them are arrogant now
[02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:31.320]  so teachers are saying you'll be arrested if you criticize Obama
[02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:33.320]  and that's waking people up
[02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:34.320]  the army puts out the document
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:36.320]  yeah we're getting reeducation camps ready
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:37.320]  for the American people
[02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:39.320]  that wakes folks up
[02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:41.320]  the Economist magazine Financial Times
[02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:43.320]  they all come out and say yeah world government's the answer
[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:44.320]  that's waking people up
[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:47.320]  they've gotten to the point now where this thing is so far along
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:51.320]  the system has to bring it out in the open
[02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:53.320]  it's that simple
[02:10:53.320 --> 02:10:58.320]  and because my shelf you countless others out there
[02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:00.320]  millions of Liberty lovers worldwide
[02:11:00.320 --> 02:11:01.320]  not just in the US
[02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:04.320]  hundreds of millions have been talking about this
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:06.320]  and the general public thinks they're cool
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:08.320]  because they don't have respect for themselves
[02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:10.320]  if they repeat what TV said
[02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:11.320]  because that's TV
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:12.320]  I mean that's fancy
[02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:14.320]  the teleprompter person said that
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:15.320]  or the sitcom or drama
[02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:18.320]  or movie said that or a cop said that in a movie
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:20.320]  I mean that's what really cool people say
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:25.320]  no that's what propaganda says to implant that in your mind
[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:28.320]  so they come back at you with oh you're a conspiracy theorist
[02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:30.320]  because you don't think the government should be giant
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:33.320]  or you think the government might be nefarious
[02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:35.320]  you look at them and you say
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:38.320]  man you really are stupid
[02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:41.320]  you're using some throwaway line on me
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:43.320]  while the government's growing exponentially
[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:45.320]  our country's being bankrupted
[02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:47.320]  the borders are wide open
[02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:49.320]  treason is being committed
[02:11:49.320 --> 02:11:51.320]  the UN's telling the president what to do
[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:52.320]  well so what?
[02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:55.320]  what's the point of a president then?
[02:11:55.320 --> 02:11:58.320]  you're sitting here making jokes about somebody
[02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:01.320]  who's bringing up points that the founders believed in
[02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:05.320]  oh the founders they were just old racist white men
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:07.320]  excuse me a white yuppie saying that
[02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:08.320]  I'm like well then
[02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:10.320]  so you do say throw out everything they called for
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:12.320]  keep government out of religion
[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:14.320]  keep government out of your house
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:15.320]  have low taxes
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:17.320]  have a separation of powers
[02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:18.320]  have due process
[02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:20.320]  have warrants so the cops can't break in your house
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:21.320]  anytime they feel like it
[02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:23.320]  because everywhere else in the world they just show up
[02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:24.320]  whenever they want
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:26.320]  cop thinks your wife's hot goes in
[02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:29.320]  that's how it is in third world countries by the way
[02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:32.320]  and Eastern Europe and other places
[02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:34.320]  I mean I saw articles here today
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:37.320]  where a guy's fighting for his life if they're being stabbed
[02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:39.320]  more than 50 times by a bunch of hoodlums
[02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:42.320]  and I was reading articles where in areas of northern Europe
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:46.320]  you're arrested if you even fight back while being stabbed
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:47.320]  England's becoming the same way
[02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:48.320]  and I thought about how
[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:51.320]  they won't let people get any type of martial arts training
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:52.320]  or anything
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:56.320]  I mean it's so pathetic what the globalist culture is
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:13:00.320]  it's a culture to secure criminal reign
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:02.320]  it's a culture to secure the ruling class
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:08.320]  and all their minions can do and engage in whatever they want
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:11.320]  and I for one have had enough of it
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:12.320]  and I want to say this
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:14.320]  we're having a lot of victories right now
[02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:15.320]  but it really hit me
[02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:17.320]  I was poleaxed by this last night
[02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:20.320]  the biggest victory we've got
[02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:23.320]  is the Second Amendment
[02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:27.320]  it burns in the gut
[02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:29.320]  and in the mind of the globalist control freaks
[02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:32.320]  who are just amassing all this military hardware
[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:33.320]  and training against us
[02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:35.320]  that the American people are waking up
[02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:38.320]  and buying 3, 4, 5 million guns a month
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:40.320]  double any previous record
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:43.320]  it angers them that people are getting back
[02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:44.320]  to being self-sufficient
[02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:46.320]  and trying to move to the countryside
[02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:48.320]  the trendies and the liberals
[02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:50.320]  and the conservatives are all getting together
[02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:53.320]  and waking up to being agrarian again
[02:13:53.320 --> 02:13:55.320]  that totally freaks the New World Order out
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:56.320]  so they've got countermeasures
[02:13:56.320 --> 02:14:00.320]  but that's only waking people up that much faster
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:02.320]  and when the system comes out and says
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:05.320]  guns aren't cool everybody knows they are
[02:14:05.320 --> 02:14:06.320]  when the system comes out and saying
[02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:10.320]  having a garden is bad everybody knows it is
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:14.320]  good to have a garden
[02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:16.320]  and again you're like yeah this is all common sense
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:19.320]  okay well let's get that common sense out to other people
[02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:21.320]  but it really hit me last night
[02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:23.320]  it hit me hard
[02:14:23.320 --> 02:14:25.320]  hit me really hard
[02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:31.320]  that
[02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:36.320]  it really hit me that I need to focus more
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:39.320]  and point out to everybody
[02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:43.320]  in a big way
[02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:45.320]  that we can beat these people
[02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:50.320]  there are so many fronts that we're having a lot of success on
[02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:53.320]  a lot of fronts
[02:14:53.320 --> 02:14:56.320]  and
[02:14:56.320 --> 02:14:59.320]  if we just point out the victories we've had
[02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:01.320]  and we continue to point out how criminal
[02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:03.320]  the opposition to liberty is
[02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:07.320]  now liberty, criminality, freedom, slavery
[02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:11.320]  empowerment, disempowerment
[02:15:11.320 --> 02:15:16.320]  exhilaration, humiliation
[02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:20.320]  I mean I choose the good stuff
[02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:23.320]  and those that want to demonize this country's founders
[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:26.320]  they want to demonize the ideas of liberty and freedom
[02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:29.320]  their tyrants or their little camp followers
[02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:32.320]  who are so afraid of the power structure
[02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:35.320]  they think by groveling to it and endorsing it
[02:15:35.320 --> 02:15:38.320]  they're going to somehow be part of that structure
[02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:42.320]  it is beyond ignorant
[02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:45.320]  but the fact that they've got a UN treaty to ban
[02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:47.320]  civilian ownership of firearms
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:49.320]  the fact that Hillary says they want to sign it
[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:51.320]  and try to enforce it
[02:15:51.320 --> 02:15:54.320]  and the fact that they know, the system knows
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:56.320]  nobody's putting up with any other incremental
[02:15:56.320 --> 02:15:58.320]  non-control anymore
[02:15:58.320 --> 02:16:00.320]  nobody's putting up with their false flag terror attacks
[02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:02.320]  sending guns into Mexico
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:04.320]  to blame it on the Second Amendment
[02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:06.320]  the jig is up, it's over
[02:16:06.320 --> 02:16:08.320]  our beachhead through the Second Amendment
[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:10.320]  that was put there for a reason
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:12.320]  you got the First Amendment
[02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:14.320]  the power of the pen, next you got the sword
[02:16:14.320 --> 02:16:17.320]  and they are chewing up every other right
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:20.320]  overthrowing it, trying to train the public
[02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:23.320]  who is not accustomed to having access
[02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:26.320]  and being confronted
[02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:28.320]  by police and military
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:31.320]  they're trying to train all of us to be accustomed to the fact
[02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:34.320]  that the system has access to our homes, our person
[02:16:34.320 --> 02:16:37.320]  our bodies, they're trying to get us used to that contact
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:39.320]  to try to bring in martial law
[02:16:39.320 --> 02:16:41.320]  I mean that's what martial law is
[02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:43.320]  I mean I drive around Austin, Texas now
[02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:45.320]  our surrounding areas
[02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:47.320]  I was out in Bastrop yesterday
[02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:50.320]  and I had like six guns in the back of my car
[02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:52.320]  which are totally legal and lawful
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:54.320]  rifles and I was going out to do another shoot
[02:16:54.320 --> 02:16:56.320]  with the Steiner brothers
[02:16:56.320 --> 02:16:58.320]  out at their ranch
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:01.320]  these beautiful hills overlooking this little lake
[02:17:01.320 --> 02:17:03.320]  it was incredible shots
[02:17:03.320 --> 02:17:05.320]  wait till you see what we did
[02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:07.320]  and I had two cops follow behind me
[02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:10.320]  on the way in from outside Austin
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:13.320]  out west in the hill country
[02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:16.320]  cops everywhere pulling people over on the main highway
[02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:19.320]  cops driving out to Bastrop all over the place
[02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:22.320]  cops all over Bastrop driving back into town last night
[02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:24.320]  we went and got dinner
[02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:26.320]  cops driving into Austin
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:28.320]  and did it make me feel good
[02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:30.320]  you know that's the question
[02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:32.320]  and I'm just thinking oh my gosh
[02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:34.320]  state police behind me oh my gosh
[02:17:34.320 --> 02:17:36.320]  Bastrop police behind me oh my gosh
[02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:38.320]  dripping springs cops behind me
[02:17:38.320 --> 02:17:40.320]  they're gonna pull me over
[02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:43.320]  they're gonna sit there and see six guns laid out in the back
[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:46.320]  and you know big cases of spent ammo
[02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:50.320]  and I'm not gonna answer 20 questions
[02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:52.320]  I'm gonna say listen you got a problem with my guns
[02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:55.320]  literally get the hell out of my country
[02:17:55.320 --> 02:17:56.320]  I was thinking about what I was gonna say
[02:17:56.320 --> 02:17:58.320]  leave me alone it's my country
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:17:59.320]  I haven't done anything wrong
[02:17:59.320 --> 02:18:01.320]  and I shouldn't feel bad
[02:18:01.320 --> 02:18:04.320]  when you pull me over for whatever reason
[02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:06.320]  okay you don't make me feel good
[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:09.320]  now again chances are the cops would have pulled me over
[02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:10.320]  but I wasn't speeding
[02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:11.320]  it wouldn't have been an issue
[02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:13.320]  but I'm just getting the point where
[02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:15.320]  I can't be messed with anymore
[02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:16.320]  you know what I mean?
[02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:18.320]  I mean I read we're in Chicago
[02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:20.320]  they're setting up these three
[02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:23.320]  trendies that wanted to go have fun and protest
[02:18:23.320 --> 02:18:25.320]  and they're saying yes they were set up
[02:18:25.320 --> 02:18:28.320]  that yes they were put in a apartment
[02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:30.320]  and they think the people that gave them the apartment
[02:18:30.320 --> 02:18:33.320]  set them up with the beer making equipment
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:35.320]  they're saying are mall off cocktails
[02:18:35.320 --> 02:18:37.320]  and that's how this works folks
[02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:40.320]  Luke thinks they were set up like that
[02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:42.320]  they were trying to set them up
[02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:44.320]  an exact group connected to that
[02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:47.320]  I mean never go to some city
[02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:49.320]  and go to somebody's house you don't know
[02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:52.320]  who invites you there off you know Facebook
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:54.320]  or Craigslist or whatever to stay there
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:56.320]  I mean it's they will put you in prison
[02:18:56.320 --> 02:18:59.320]  in two seconds and sleep all night about it
[02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:01.320]  I'm going to Bilderberg
[02:19:01.320 --> 02:19:04.320]  and I'm not going to have any weapons
[02:19:04.320 --> 02:19:06.320]  not planning anything violent
[02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:08.320]  if anybody ever sets us up
[02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:09.320]  I'm not scared of that
[02:19:09.320 --> 02:19:11.320]  they're criminals they're scum
[02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:12.320]  and try to set me up
[02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:15.320]  that's just the way it is I put my faith in God
[02:19:15.320 --> 02:19:17.320]  I don't think that's going to happen
[02:19:17.320 --> 02:19:19.320]  but I wouldn't be surprised someday if it doesn't
[02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:21.320]  because that's just the way it is
[02:19:21.320 --> 02:19:23.320]  this is a criminal system
[02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:25.320]  but I'm going to protest Bilderberg
[02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:26.320]  and so are thousands of other people
[02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:27.320]  and that's the end of it
[02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:29.320]  and these guys will get on our tail
[02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:31.320]  in unmarked cars
[02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:32.320]  and we'll just stop the car and get out
[02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:33.320]  and they'll drive away from us
[02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:35.320]  and we start following them
[02:19:35.320 --> 02:19:36.320]  and they'll pull up at a restaurant
[02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:40.320]  and run and lock themselves in the bathroom
[02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:44.320]  so again I'm done being fearful
[02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:45.320]  I'm done
[02:19:45.320 --> 02:19:48.320]  and again the fact that the people
[02:19:48.320 --> 02:19:51.320]  know the government wants our guns to make us slaves
[02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:53.320]  the fact that people all across the political spectrum
[02:19:53.320 --> 02:19:54.320]  are buying guns
[02:19:54.320 --> 02:19:56.320]  it just shows that they cannot win
[02:19:56.320 --> 02:19:58.320]  when the people are against them

[02:24:30.320 --> 02:24:32.320]  and as the big think tanks
[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:34.320]  of the Rockefeller Foundation said
[02:24:34.320 --> 02:24:35.320]  50, 60 years ago
[02:24:35.320 --> 02:24:37.320]  we will encourage homosexuality
[02:24:37.320 --> 02:24:39.320]  so people don't have families
[02:24:39.320 --> 02:24:43.320]  so that they see the state as their family
[02:24:43.320 --> 02:24:45.320]  I'm going to be covering that
[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:49.320]  Also, if you go to drudgereport.com
[02:24:49.320 --> 02:24:51.320]  we've got a big article out today
[02:24:51.320 --> 02:24:53.320]  Pistol TSA Gropers
[02:24:53.320 --> 02:24:55.320]  being trained to feel for crotch bombs
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:58.320]  and they admit the crotch is now the key
[02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:00.320]  your crotch is very suspicious
[02:25:00.320 --> 02:25:02.320]  the government minion
[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:04.320]  forget to get the government out of your bedroom
[02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:06.320]  how about government out of my pants
[02:25:06.320 --> 02:25:08.320]  and if you go back to the drudge headline
[02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:10.320]  it's linked to the hill
[02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:13.320]  it says that they are increasing fees
[02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:16.320]  to fly to fund the expansion of the TSA
[02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:18.320]  onto the highways of America
[02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:19.320]  that's what's really happening
[02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:21.320]  now they've announced TSA
[02:25:21.320 --> 02:25:23.320]  to be in every city of the country
[02:25:23.320 --> 02:25:25.320]  and your airport fees are going to pay for it
[02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:26.320]  let's go back to drudge
[02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:29.320]  I want to show TV viewers that photo
[02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:32.320]  a recent photo of the man standing there
[02:25:32.320 --> 02:25:34.320]  with his hands out like he's a terrorist
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:36.320]  it's all about submission
[02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:38.320]  we had another photo up earlier
[02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:40.320]  I guess that was him full words with the guy's hands are out
[02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:42.320]  but there's the guy with the TSA
[02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:44.320]  gripping his genitals
[02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:46.320]  I'm sorry to talk like that on air
[02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:48.320]  but that's medically what's happening there
[02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:50.320]  and if you don't like him going up
[02:25:50.320 --> 02:25:52.320]  and actually squeezing to see what it is
[02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:54.320]  well you're just on American
[02:25:54.320 --> 02:25:56.320]  that's got to be the new American flag
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:25:58.320]  in fact have you get caged near the graphics guy
[02:25:58.320 --> 02:26:00.320]  I want to take that photo
[02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:02.320]  I want to make that the
[02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:04.320]  the field of blue
[02:26:04.320 --> 02:26:06.320]  that it's perfectly square
[02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:08.320]  and have like barbed wire
[02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:10.320]  you know our standard barbed wire
[02:26:10.320 --> 02:26:12.320]  legalized freedom shirt
[02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:14.320]  I want to put that up on in full words right now
[02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:16.320]  I want that
[02:26:16.320 --> 02:26:18.320]  to be the field of blue
[02:26:18.320 --> 02:26:20.320]  and then
[02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:22.320]  the rest of it
[02:26:22.320 --> 02:26:24.320]  maybe Prozac pills or something
[02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:26.320]  or maybe kids being kidnapped by the government
[02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:28.320]  and raped and murdered
[02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:30.320]  we could have like a really nice American flag
[02:26:30.320 --> 02:26:32.320]  but there is the new American flag
[02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:34.320]  an old guy being wanded
[02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:36.320]  totally bending over to him
[02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:38.320]  and then you got this guy going
[02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:40.320]  sir
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:42.320]  well you know what South Park says
[02:26:42.320 --> 02:26:44.320]  let me look inside there
[02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:46.320]  and see what's going on
[02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:48.320]  and by the way you can tell those guys fly a lot
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:50.320]  because that is exactly
[02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:52.320]  I was watching that I don't really like South Park
[02:26:52.320 --> 02:26:54.320]  because I'm under the dirty humor
[02:26:54.320 --> 02:26:56.320]  but in the case of the TSA that's what they're doing
[02:26:56.320 --> 02:26:58.320]  in fact they're not even people think it's funny
[02:26:58.320 --> 02:27:00.320]  but that's what they actually do
[02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:02.320]  that episode
[02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:04.320]  that's their toilet
[02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:06.320]  and so they ban
[02:27:06.320 --> 02:27:08.320]  people
[02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:10.320]  what is it sitting on the toilet
[02:27:10.320 --> 02:27:12.320]  or whatever so they have the toilet police
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:14.320]  that's what TSA toilet
[02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:16.320]  safety administration
[02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:18.320]  and they're running around going after people
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:20.320]  so that's some of what's coming up
[02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:22.320]  I got a ton of news here I got to get to
[02:27:22.320 --> 02:27:24.320]  let's go to Scott in Arizona
[02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:26.320]  you're on the air you evil thought criminal
[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:28.320]  you may need the TSA to make sure there's not a
[02:27:28.320 --> 02:27:30.320]  how do I even know you don't have a bomb in your pants right now
[02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:32.320]  should I call the police on you
[02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:34.320]  I mean there used to be presumption of innocence
[02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:36.320]  because society can't operate if you think everybody's guilty
[02:27:36.320 --> 02:27:38.320]  but let me call the police right now
[02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:40.320]  ladies and gentlemen yes officer
[02:27:40.320 --> 02:27:42.320]  Scott just called in from Arizona
[02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:44.320]  and he might be a terrorist he might have a bomb
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:46.320]  in his pants do I have any proof
[02:27:46.320 --> 02:27:48.320]  no no but he does he does just
[02:27:48.320 --> 02:27:50.320]  I need somebody to get over there and grope him right now
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:52.320]  that's how insane this is
[02:27:52.320 --> 02:27:54.320]  but it's not insane to take over
[02:27:54.320 --> 02:27:56.320]  think about the globalists are laughing at you right now
[02:27:56.320 --> 02:27:58.320]  what do we do to make sure we break their will
[02:27:58.320 --> 02:28:00.320]  no there we go hold on
[02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:02.320]  he's
[02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:04.320]  even having a crotch
[02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:06.320]  pistol he actually put a report out saying
[02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:08.320]  the crotch is their main focus now
[02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:10.320]  I'm not making I'm not joking this up
[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:12.320]  I'm not joking this up
[02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:14.320]  I'm inventing some new things
[02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:16.320]  oh my gosh
[02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:18.320]  let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Arizona
[02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:20.320]  go ahead I'm sorry
[02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:22.320]  that's okay
[02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:24.320]  I actually am taking punishment to the skull
[02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:26.320]  now that I'm off of the
[02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:28.320]  the cell phone
[02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:30.320]  speakerphone so I'm taking it
[02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:32.320]  directly to the brain now so I'm
[02:28:32.320 --> 02:28:34.320]  serving my due
[02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:36.320]  yes so hey

[02:28:52.320 --> 02:28:54.320]  that we might find
[02:28:54.320 --> 02:28:56.320]  some fat guy with a mustache
[02:28:56.320 --> 02:28:58.320]  sweating with dirty gloves
[02:28:58.320 --> 02:29:00.320]  sticking his hands down your wife's pants

[02:33:56.320 --> 02:33:58.320]  we don't have to give
[02:33:58.320 --> 02:34:00.320]  into evil
[02:34:00.320 --> 02:34:02.320]  we don't have to give into corruption
[02:34:02.320 --> 02:34:04.320]  we can turn things around
[02:34:04.320 --> 02:34:06.320]  we've got to learn to recognize good
[02:34:06.320 --> 02:34:08.320]  from evil propaganda
[02:34:08.320 --> 02:34:10.320]  from truth
[02:34:10.320 --> 02:34:12.320]  it's that simple
[02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:14.320]  alright Scott I'm gonna shut up go ahead and make your point
[02:34:14.320 --> 02:34:16.320]  alright
[02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:18.320]  hey Alex
[02:34:18.320 --> 02:34:20.320]  two things quick
[02:34:20.320 --> 02:34:22.320]  number one is I would love to hear
[02:34:22.320 --> 02:34:24.320]  talk about
[02:34:24.320 --> 02:34:26.320]  his suggestions for food storage
[02:34:26.320 --> 02:34:28.320]  in the long term
[02:34:28.320 --> 02:34:30.320]  since most of what you're gonna find out there
[02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:32.320]  is just riddled with gluten
[02:34:32.320 --> 02:34:34.320]  outside of the obvious
[02:34:34.320 --> 02:34:36.320]  which is buy bags or rice
[02:34:36.320 --> 02:34:38.320]  and things like that
[02:34:38.320 --> 02:34:40.320]  that's something I'd like to hear and talk about
[02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:42.320]  maybe you can bring up some creative ideas
[02:34:42.320 --> 02:34:44.320]  for long term food storage
[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:46.320]  the other thing is
[02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:48.320]  I've listened to this guy off and on for quite some time
[02:34:48.320 --> 02:34:50.320]  and I wondered if you've ever looked into
[02:34:50.320 --> 02:34:52.320]  or made a suggestion having him on
[02:34:52.320 --> 02:34:54.320]  because we're always looking for solutions
[02:34:54.320 --> 02:34:56.320]  and that is
[02:34:56.320 --> 02:34:58.320]  are you familiar with that
[02:34:58.320 --> 02:35:00.320]  he's on a radio
[02:35:00.320 --> 02:35:02.320]  not like a radio radio show but they do
[02:35:02.320 --> 02:35:04.320]  like a conference call thing on a station
[02:35:04.320 --> 02:35:06.320]  called Talk Shoe
[02:35:06.320 --> 02:35:08.320]  called AIB Radio his name is Rod Class
[02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:10.320]  have you ever heard of him?
[02:35:10.320 --> 02:35:12.320]  never heard of him but send me some info god bless my friend
[02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:14.320]  I'm gonna get into more of the news here in a moment
[02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:16.320]  but let's continue with your calls
[02:35:16.320 --> 02:35:18.320]  Wayne in Colorado you're on the air go ahead
[02:35:18.320 --> 02:35:20.320]  hello Alex hey buddy
[02:35:20.320 --> 02:35:22.320]  Kudos from Colorado hey I just wanted to pass on some news
[02:35:22.320 --> 02:35:24.320]  I saw this morning on
[02:35:24.320 --> 02:35:26.320]  an alternative news channel called RT News
[02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:28.320]  I don't know if you've heard of it
[02:35:28.320 --> 02:35:30.320]  but anyhow on the little news bar
[02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:32.320]  going across the bottom of the screen it said
[02:35:32.320 --> 02:35:34.320]  NATO wants to put up a missile shield
[02:35:34.320 --> 02:35:36.320]  due to Chicago protesters
[02:35:36.320 --> 02:35:38.320]  have you heard of that one?
[02:35:38.320 --> 02:35:40.320]  I'm sorry sir
[02:35:40.320 --> 02:35:42.320]  they happen to pop in my ear right when you were asking
[02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:44.320]  your question go ahead and ask that again
[02:35:44.320 --> 02:35:46.320]  oh sure yeah I was
[02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:48.320]  watching this RT News channel
[02:35:48.320 --> 02:35:50.320]  it's an alternative news program on TV
[02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:52.320]  and on the bottom of the screen this is going
[02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:54.320]  across the bottom it said NATO
[02:35:54.320 --> 02:35:56.320]  wants missile shield due to Chicago
[02:35:56.320 --> 02:35:58.320]  protesters have you heard of that?
[02:35:58.320 --> 02:36:00.320]  no but I know
[02:36:00.320 --> 02:36:02.320]  that everywhere NATO
[02:36:02.320 --> 02:36:04.320]  or the G20 or the globalist go
[02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:06.320]  they demand a police state be erected
[02:36:06.320 --> 02:36:08.320]  and at the Olympics
[02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:10.320]  and other places they put up missile shields
[02:36:10.320 --> 02:36:12.320]  for Al Qaeda's Air Force
[02:36:12.320 --> 02:36:14.320]  the same Al Qaeda
[02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:16.320]  that they're openly funding in Libya
[02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:18.320]  Syria and to attack the Iranians
[02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:20.320]  I mean it's ridiculous
[02:36:20.320 --> 02:36:22.320]  they stage the terror
[02:36:22.320 --> 02:36:24.320]  I mean NATO is on record shipping
[02:36:24.320 --> 02:36:26.320]  opium all over the world it's the mafia
[02:36:26.320 --> 02:36:28.320]  the real mafia
[02:36:28.320 --> 02:36:30.320]  runs the military the real organized crime
[02:36:30.320 --> 02:36:32.320]  issues the money
[02:36:32.320 --> 02:36:34.320]  it's the federal reserve
[02:36:34.320 --> 02:36:36.320]  and so I was not aware of that but I could search
[02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:38.320]  that guys search
[02:36:38.320 --> 02:36:40.320]  NATO wants missile shield over Chicago
[02:36:40.320 --> 02:36:42.320]  and we'll probably
[02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:44.320]  find that report anything else sir?
[02:36:44.320 --> 02:36:46.320]  picking it up

[02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:10.320]  dealing with fluoride
[02:37:10.320 --> 02:37:12.320]  hardening of the arteries yeah no kidding
[02:37:12.320 --> 02:37:14.320]  fries the bones fries the joints
[02:37:14.320 --> 02:37:16.320]  hey but who cares the government loves you
[02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:18.320]  they put it in there to make your teeth
[02:37:18.320 --> 02:37:20.320]  healthy let's go to
[02:37:20.320 --> 02:37:22.320]  Daryl in Georgia Daryl you're on the air
[02:37:22.320 --> 02:37:24.320]  hello sir can you hear me clear?
[02:37:24.320 --> 02:37:26.320]  yes I can
[02:37:26.320 --> 02:37:28.320]  awesome hello from my wife
[02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:30.320]  and kids we
[02:37:30.320 --> 02:37:32.320]  appreciate what you're going to attack the
[02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:34.320]  Build a Big Group you know this is a worldwide
[02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:36.320]  organization my only issue
[02:37:36.320 --> 02:37:38.320]  is the elite of America
[02:37:38.320 --> 02:37:40.320]  why are they not in jail like Rick Perry
[02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:42.320]  Bill Clinton
[02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:44.320]  Tim Geithner Ben Bernanke
[02:37:44.320 --> 02:37:46.320]  the commissioner of the
[02:37:46.320 --> 02:37:48.320]  federal the IRS
[02:37:48.320 --> 02:37:50.320]  it's sick of me that
[02:37:50.320 --> 02:37:52.320]  these people commit the most
[02:37:52.320 --> 02:37:54.320]  worst crimes but then where to one throw
[02:37:54.320 --> 02:37:56.320]  in these jails and that right there
[02:37:56.320 --> 02:37:58.320]  just really angers me but you know
[02:37:58.320 --> 02:38:00.320]  we have to channel that energy
[02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:02.320]  into a positive way and fight them the correct way
[02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:04.320]  because they want us to
[02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:06.320]  get wild and get violent so they
[02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:08.320]  can have an excuse
[02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:10.320]  you know enforce their rule among
[02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:12.320]  us well I agree with you
[02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:14.320]  but it's because they're criminals
[02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:16.320]  but they got control of government that's
[02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:18.320]  what tyranny is criminals running
[02:38:18.320 --> 02:38:20.320]  government that they're unaccountable
[02:38:20.320 --> 02:38:22.320]  I mean look at Corzine stealing billions
[02:38:22.320 --> 02:38:24.320]  not getting in trouble look at Obama with
[02:38:24.320 --> 02:38:26.320]  fast and furious and billions to his
[02:38:26.320 --> 02:38:28.320]  buddies in contracts
[02:38:28.320 --> 02:38:30.320]  for alternative energy where they
[02:38:30.320 --> 02:38:32.320]  never even opened offices up
[02:38:32.320 --> 02:38:34.320]  I mean it's concentrated
[02:38:34.320 --> 02:38:36.320]  corruption
[02:38:36.320 --> 02:38:38.320]  and they are devaluing the dollar
[02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:40.320]  they are paying to ship our jobs
[02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:42.320]  overseas so that China is
[02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:44.320]  dependent on them it's not about
[02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:46.320]  building China up or even building up the US
[02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:48.320]  it's about making us all dependent
[02:38:48.320 --> 02:38:50.320]  they want every country
[02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:52.320]  dependent and then
[02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:54.320]  only the globalist can control
[02:38:54.320 --> 02:38:56.320]  things because they control
[02:38:56.320 --> 02:38:58.320]  all the countries by playing them off against each other
[02:38:58.320 --> 02:39:00.320]  God bless you I appreciate your call
[02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:02.320]  okay let's talk to Alan in New Hampshire
[02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:04.320]  you're on the air go ahead
[02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:06.320]  how are you this afternoon
[02:39:06.320 --> 02:39:08.320]  calling from FEMA Region 1
[02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:10.320]  I'm a former Marine
[02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:12.320]  former New Hampshire state correctional officer
[02:39:12.320 --> 02:39:14.320]  and I have a list of things
[02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:16.320]  that I would like to touch on I'd like
[02:39:16.320 --> 02:39:18.320]  to get the most from
[02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:20.320]  first of all the sexualization
[02:39:20.320 --> 02:39:22.320]  of children in the schools
[02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:24.320]  I have an 11 year old sister
[02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:26.320]  attending grade school
[02:39:26.320 --> 02:39:28.320]  and they had a quote unquote
[02:39:28.320 --> 02:39:30.320]  puberty class and
[02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:32.320]  during this class the instructor told
[02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:34.320]  the children to go
[02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:36.320]  into the bathroom and wash their hands
[02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:38.320]  and explore themselves
[02:39:40.320 --> 02:39:42.320]  yeah they need to get in major trouble
[02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:44.320]  for that I've seen the handbooks
[02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:46.320]  that they give even six seven year olds
[02:39:46.320 --> 02:39:48.320]  well the Clintons did that they wanted
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:50.320]  masturbation training
[02:39:50.320 --> 02:39:52.320]  in fact remember
[02:39:52.320 --> 02:39:54.320]  whenever the
[02:39:54.320 --> 02:39:56.320]  surgeon general came out
[02:39:56.320 --> 02:39:58.320]  and told kids to do that and I mean imagine
[02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:00.320]  how that enters your mind
[02:40:00.320 --> 02:40:02.320]  to want to be a kindergarten teacher
[02:40:02.320 --> 02:40:04.320]  and want to sexualize
[02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:06.320]  children it is
[02:40:06.320 --> 02:40:08.320]  again they're a bunch of pervs
[02:40:08.320 --> 02:40:10.320]  normal people don't want
[02:40:10.320 --> 02:40:12.320]  power so we never get into power
[02:40:12.320 --> 02:40:14.320]  scum crave it
[02:40:14.320 --> 02:40:16.320]  so they run everything
[02:40:16.320 --> 02:40:18.320]  and that's why my children don't go to
[02:40:18.320 --> 02:40:20.320]  public school they don't go to private school
[02:40:20.320 --> 02:40:22.320]  except for occasional academies where
[02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:24.320]  they go to take tests and compete
[02:40:24.320 --> 02:40:26.320]  because most children
[02:40:26.320 --> 02:40:28.320]  sit there and watch television all day
[02:40:28.320 --> 02:40:30.320]  their innocence is destroyed
[02:40:30.320 --> 02:40:32.320]  and there's so many predators
[02:40:32.320 --> 02:40:34.320]  that are involved working in and around
[02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:36.320]  children but you're saying where is this
[02:40:36.320 --> 02:40:38.320]  that you're located where they're telling
[02:40:38.320 --> 02:40:40.320]  children to go in the bathrooms
[02:40:40.320 --> 02:40:42.320]  and masturbate basically
[02:40:42.320 --> 02:40:44.320]  it would be in Conway
[02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:46.320]  New Hampshire up here in the northeast
[02:40:46.320 --> 02:40:48.320]  the instructor
[02:40:48.320 --> 02:40:50.320]  had a Facebook page and she was
[02:40:50.320 --> 02:40:52.320]  all talking about the
[02:40:52.320 --> 02:40:54.320]  she put a post up talking
[02:40:54.320 --> 02:40:56.320]  about how she's going to go teach the puberty
[02:40:56.320 --> 02:40:58.320]  class and then did she literally put
[02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:00.320]  tee hee hee giggling like a
[02:41:00.320 --> 02:41:02.320]  young girl who has a
[02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:04.320]  total and complete perv and you know that's
[02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:06.320]  why we've got so many of these
[02:41:06.320 --> 02:41:08.320]  teachers having sex with their students
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:10.320]  male and female
[02:41:10.320 --> 02:41:12.320]  and
[02:41:12.320 --> 02:41:14.320]  it just totally destroys innocence
[02:41:14.320 --> 02:41:16.320]  it just absolutely
[02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:18.320]  devastates innocence
[02:41:18.320 --> 02:41:20.320]  what is the
[02:41:20.320 --> 02:41:22.320]  Facebook can you send us her Facebook
[02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:24.320]  I can try
[02:41:26.320 --> 02:41:28.320]  but I mean this is going on everywhere
[02:41:28.320 --> 02:41:30.320]  you can just type into a search engine
[02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:32.320]  schools teaching masturbation
[02:41:32.320 --> 02:41:34.320]  this has been a big 15 year situation
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:36.320]  and
[02:41:36.320 --> 02:41:38.320]  what's amazing though is growing up in Texas
[02:41:40.320 --> 02:41:42.320]  you can drive two hours especially back then
[02:41:42.320 --> 02:41:44.320]  without ever seeing a gas station
[02:41:44.320 --> 02:41:46.320]  and
[02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:48.320]  women would just have to hold it
[02:41:48.320 --> 02:41:50.320]  but sometimes they'd even go behind a bush
[02:41:50.320 --> 02:41:52.320]  but you know we'd pull over go behind a bush
[02:41:52.320 --> 02:41:54.320]  now the police
[02:41:54.320 --> 02:41:56.320]  will see you doing that
[02:41:56.320 --> 02:41:58.320]  will pull over this is in the news all the time
[02:41:58.320 --> 02:42:00.320]  will say show me what you were doing they'll go over
[02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:02.320]  get you to admit that that's your urine
[02:42:02.320 --> 02:42:04.320]  you know behind the bushes
[02:42:04.320 --> 02:42:06.320]  and arrest you for indecent exposure
[02:42:06.320 --> 02:42:08.320]  even though no one was around
[02:42:08.320 --> 02:42:10.320]  because they will need to fill those giant
[02:42:10.320 --> 02:42:12.320]  prisons that's our main economy now we have
[02:42:12.320 --> 02:42:14.320]  double what China has and
[02:42:14.320 --> 02:42:16.320]  so that's how they operate and
[02:42:16.320 --> 02:42:18.320]  but then you see cops doing it out in the middle
[02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:20.320]  of nowhere what are you supposed to do so
[02:42:20.320 --> 02:42:22.320]  that's you're gonna go to jail for
[02:42:22.320 --> 02:42:24.320]  but
[02:42:24.320 --> 02:42:26.320]  if you want to teach in fact I can't
[02:42:26.320 --> 02:42:28.320]  even say what they teach
[02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:30.320]  children by the
[02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:32.320]  eighth grade in public schools nationwide
[02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:34.320]  they teach them things
[02:42:34.320 --> 02:42:36.320]  I didn't know about until I was in college
[02:42:36.320 --> 02:42:38.320]  and quite frankly
[02:42:38.320 --> 02:42:40.320]  don't have trouble believing but
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:42.320]  I'm told it's widespread
[02:42:42.320 --> 02:42:44.320]  again
[02:42:44.320 --> 02:42:46.320]  it's like I said the other day I
[02:42:46.320 --> 02:42:48.320]  enjoy eating a breakfast taco in the morning
[02:42:48.320 --> 02:42:50.320]  with queso or not with queso that was
[02:42:50.320 --> 02:42:52.320]  the old days with hot sauce
[02:42:52.320 --> 02:42:54.320]  I never get sick
[02:42:54.320 --> 02:42:56.320]  of eating a breakfast taco do it a couple
[02:42:56.320 --> 02:42:58.320]  times a week and I dovetailed
[02:42:58.320 --> 02:43:00.320]  that with the seven roasted babies
[02:43:00.320 --> 02:43:02.320]  being flown in
[02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:04.320]  for black magic people to eat
[02:43:04.320 --> 02:43:06.320]  that was in several big newspapers
[02:43:06.320 --> 02:43:08.320]  for them that's really fancy
[02:43:08.320 --> 02:43:10.320]  getting a roasted baby out wrapped in gold
[02:43:10.320 --> 02:43:12.320]  leaf and slicing off delicious pieces
[02:43:12.320 --> 02:43:14.320]  thinking you get power from it see
[02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:16.320]  we're not normal to them
[02:43:16.320 --> 02:43:18.320]  we're bad because we don't
[02:43:18.320 --> 02:43:20.320]  want to corrupt children their religion
[02:43:20.320 --> 02:43:22.320]  is about corrupting children
[02:43:22.320 --> 02:43:24.320]  and doing something naughty
[02:43:24.320 --> 02:43:26.320]  they think because we're not
[02:43:26.320 --> 02:43:28.320]  into degenerate things
[02:43:28.320 --> 02:43:30.320]  that we're just not cool
[02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:32.320]  no
[02:43:32.320 --> 02:43:34.320]  we like innocence we like happiness
[02:43:34.320 --> 02:43:36.320]  we also like bashing pieces of
[02:43:36.320 --> 02:43:38.320]  Phil's heads in but it's not
[02:43:38.320 --> 02:43:40.320]  it's a normal response to it
[02:43:40.320 --> 02:43:42.320]  the point is they
[02:43:42.320 --> 02:43:44.320]  are starting to rant sir I'm sorry go ahead
[02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:46.320]  and make your points
[02:43:46.320 --> 02:43:48.320]  that's okay the other point I've been
[02:43:48.320 --> 02:43:50.320]  waking people up daily
[02:43:50.320 --> 02:43:52.320]  every time I go out in public I wind up
[02:43:52.320 --> 02:43:54.320]  in a deep conversation waking people up
[02:43:54.320 --> 02:43:56.320]  actually I was at the supermarket the other day
[02:43:56.320 --> 02:43:58.320]  and I picked up some hamburger and I asked
[02:43:58.320 --> 02:44:00.320]  the butcher I said how can I tell
[02:44:00.320 --> 02:44:02.320]  which one has pink slime in it
[02:44:02.320 --> 02:44:04.320]  and he turned to me and kind of whispered
[02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:06.320]  he said it all has pink slime in it
[02:44:06.320 --> 02:44:08.320]  except for the 80% stuff because that's
[02:44:08.320 --> 02:44:10.320]  the stuff that we grind right here
[02:44:10.320 --> 02:44:12.320]  people around me and next thing you know
[02:44:12.320 --> 02:44:14.320]  people in the aisles are putting
[02:44:14.320 --> 02:44:16.320]  their
[02:44:16.320 --> 02:44:18.320]  putting the hamburger back up on the shelf
[02:44:18.320 --> 02:44:20.320]  let me stop you again this caller is so awesome
[02:44:20.320 --> 02:44:22.320]  he's calling in
[02:44:22.320 --> 02:44:24.320]  with real issues after real issues
[02:44:24.320 --> 02:44:26.320]  and look
[02:44:26.320 --> 02:44:28.320]  they admit most hamburger meat has reconstituted
[02:44:28.320 --> 02:44:30.320]  filled with cancer causing
[02:44:30.320 --> 02:44:32.320]  deadly chemicals it's admitted
[02:44:32.320 --> 02:44:34.320]  it's this garbage
[02:44:34.320 --> 02:44:36.320]  and you've got to buy exactly 80 to 90%
[02:44:36.320 --> 02:44:38.320]  a lot of places
[02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:40.320]  you can see them feeding it in right there
[02:44:40.320 --> 02:44:42.320]  and people say
[02:44:42.320 --> 02:44:44.320]  well don't complain you can't do anything
[02:44:44.320 --> 02:44:46.320]  as people become aware of
[02:44:46.320 --> 02:44:48.320]  the slime all these companies
[02:44:48.320 --> 02:44:50.320]  are having to come out and say
[02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:52.320]  we don't have slime and proving it
[02:44:52.320 --> 02:44:54.320]  we'll eradicate the slime
[02:44:54.320 --> 02:44:56.320]  three years ago I've started to come out
[02:44:56.320 --> 02:44:58.320]  they have fake filet mignon cutlets
[02:44:58.320 --> 02:45:00.320]  in a process that are really
[02:45:00.320 --> 02:45:02.320]  just blood rotten type blood
[02:45:02.320 --> 02:45:04.320]  that spills out of the cow's necks
[02:45:04.320 --> 02:45:06.320]  mixed with fat reconstituted
[02:45:06.320 --> 02:45:08.320]  with a fake fat swirl in it
[02:45:08.320 --> 02:45:10.320]  and most people can't even tell the difference
[02:45:10.320 --> 02:45:12.320]  there must be idiots I can tell the difference
[02:45:12.320 --> 02:45:14.320]  but the point is
[02:45:14.320 --> 02:45:16.320]  that stuff's almost eradicated
[02:45:16.320 --> 02:45:18.320]  and at first it was a conspiracy theory three years ago
[02:45:18.320 --> 02:45:20.320]  pink slime a year ago was a conspiracy theory
[02:45:20.320 --> 02:45:22.320]  they denied it enemies of liberty
[02:45:22.320 --> 02:45:24.320]  always try to deny
[02:45:24.320 --> 02:45:26.320]  to see if that works but once this guy
[02:45:26.320 --> 02:45:28.320]  started talking
[02:45:28.320 --> 02:45:30.320]  everybody was talking and refusing it
[02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:32.320]  now that'll be a chain reaction
[02:45:32.320 --> 02:45:34.320]  soon no one will be buying
[02:45:34.320 --> 02:45:36.320]  pink slime stuff they'll have to
[02:45:36.320 --> 02:45:38.320]  advertise it's pink slime free
[02:45:38.320 --> 02:45:40.320]  just like GMO so what's the GMO
[02:45:40.320 --> 02:45:42.320]  companies doing worldwide
[02:45:42.320 --> 02:45:44.320]  trying to get laws passed where you're not
[02:45:44.320 --> 02:45:46.320]  even allowed to label
[02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:48.320]  independently that it's not GMO
[02:45:48.320 --> 02:45:50.320]  they've sued people
[02:45:50.320 --> 02:45:52.320]  the milk processors and others over that
[02:45:52.320 --> 02:45:54.320]  again you've got the power
[02:45:54.320 --> 02:45:56.320]  and what this guy just said
[02:45:56.320 --> 02:45:58.320]  is how we're going to turn it around
[02:45:58.320 --> 02:46:00.320]  the marketplace
[02:46:00.320 --> 02:46:02.320]  is where people have met for
[02:46:02.320 --> 02:46:04.320]  a thousand plus years and talked to each other
[02:46:04.320 --> 02:46:06.320]  you're supposed to talk in the market
[02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:08.320]  I'm going to put you on hold and come back to you
[02:46:08.320 --> 02:46:10.320]  but this is too important of a call
[02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:12.320]  I'm sitting there
[02:46:12.320 --> 02:46:14.320]  Sunday evening
[02:46:14.320 --> 02:46:16.320]  my son wants a kayak
[02:46:16.320 --> 02:46:18.320]  well we've got one little bitty kayak
[02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:20.320]  but then his sister and then they start fighting over it
[02:46:20.320 --> 02:46:22.320]  totally reasonable
[02:46:22.320 --> 02:46:24.320]  we need two kayaks when we go out
[02:46:24.320 --> 02:46:26.320]  someplace
[02:46:26.320 --> 02:46:28.320]  and we got a creek when it's raining
[02:46:28.320 --> 02:46:30.320]  under the house as well we can take them to
[02:46:30.320 --> 02:46:32.320]  the fishing
[02:46:32.320 --> 02:46:34.320]  point is I can throw them in the back of the truck and take them
[02:46:34.320 --> 02:46:36.320]  I'm standing there
[02:46:36.320 --> 02:46:38.320]  and the woman says
[02:46:38.320 --> 02:46:40.320]  what's your
[02:46:40.320 --> 02:46:42.320]  you know what's your
[02:46:42.320 --> 02:46:44.320]  such and such what's your
[02:46:44.320 --> 02:46:46.320]  zip code and I just said look
[02:46:46.320 --> 02:46:48.320]  you're already getting it all on this credit card
[02:46:48.320 --> 02:46:50.320]  and my son was there
[02:46:50.320 --> 02:46:52.320]  he's there right now today came into work with me
[02:46:52.320 --> 02:46:54.320]  and I said
[02:46:56.320 --> 02:46:58.320]  probably as I kind of hesitate with these stories
[02:46:58.320 --> 02:47:00.320]  I'm going back to actually exactly what happened
[02:47:00.320 --> 02:47:02.320]  I should pull up the data like anybody does
[02:47:02.320 --> 02:47:04.320]  so I'm sitting there
[02:47:04.320 --> 02:47:06.320]  at the academy sporting goods store
[02:47:06.320 --> 02:47:08.320]  and I got a bunch of ammo and stuff for the shoot
[02:47:08.320 --> 02:47:10.320]  I was about to do some extra stuff we needed
[02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:12.320]  and I'm there and I've got a couple
[02:47:12.320 --> 02:47:14.320]  t-shirts I bought I don't know why I'm telling
[02:47:14.320 --> 02:47:16.320]  that part of the story but I'm there with a few items
[02:47:16.320 --> 02:47:18.320]  and I get up there
[02:47:18.320 --> 02:47:20.320]  and I said yeah I told the guy I want that green
[02:47:20.320 --> 02:47:22.320]  kayak over there the one man kayak
[02:47:22.320 --> 02:47:24.320]  and she goes
[02:47:24.320 --> 02:47:26.320]  that's fine but you're going to have
[02:47:26.320 --> 02:47:28.320]  to fill out paperwork
[02:47:28.320 --> 02:47:30.320]  and I didn't say anything
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:32.320]  and then she says zip code
[02:47:32.320 --> 02:47:34.320]  and I said you guys have got stores on every corner
[02:47:34.320 --> 02:47:36.320]  you don't need my zip code to find out where to build a store
[02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:38.320]  and you already data minded all off of my credit card
[02:47:40.320 --> 02:47:42.320]  so
[02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:44.320]  I know the lawyers that own this company think that gives
[02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:46.320]  consent if I give you the zip code
[02:47:46.320 --> 02:47:48.320]  to use the data off the credit card
[02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:50.320]  but I said I'm not doing it
[02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:52.320]  and there's these people behind me in the line
[02:47:52.320 --> 02:47:54.320]  who look like total fluoride heads
[02:47:54.320 --> 02:47:56.320]  they look like 14
[02:47:56.320 --> 02:47:58.320]  it's people behind her
[02:47:58.320 --> 02:48:00.320]  and they look at me like I'm scum
[02:48:00.320 --> 02:48:02.320]  and I said listen in America
[02:48:02.320 --> 02:48:04.320]  it's not bad to talk to people
[02:48:04.320 --> 02:48:06.320]  and interface and they won't talk
[02:48:06.320 --> 02:48:08.320]  and I go I'm not bad you shouldn't laugh
[02:48:08.320 --> 02:48:10.320]  and give me condescending looks
[02:48:10.320 --> 02:48:12.320]  because I don't want to give her data
[02:48:12.320 --> 02:48:14.320]  manager comes over hey what's the issue Alex
[02:48:14.320 --> 02:48:16.320]  I'm not even being that loud at that point
[02:48:16.320 --> 02:48:18.320]  and I said no issue
[02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:20.320]  and the guy kind of
[02:48:20.320 --> 02:48:22.320]  aggressively gets in my space
[02:48:22.320 --> 02:48:24.320]  because you know he's powerful everybody's like little
[02:48:24.320 --> 02:48:26.320]  mini cops nowadays
[02:48:26.320 --> 02:48:28.320]  and he goes okay if you want that kayak
[02:48:28.320 --> 02:48:30.320]  you're gonna have to fill out some paperwork
[02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:32.320]  and I said it's
[02:48:32.320 --> 02:48:34.320]  I said I'm not gonna fill it out I said for a $250
[02:48:34.320 --> 02:48:36.320]  kayak I gotta fill out paperwork
[02:48:36.320 --> 02:48:38.320]  he goes well the authorities like it
[02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:40.320]  when we have all this in the records
[02:48:40.320 --> 02:48:42.320]  and I said what because I'm gonna escape Alcatraz
[02:48:42.320 --> 02:48:44.320]  and I go that's it
[02:48:44.320 --> 02:48:46.320]  I'm so sick of this country
[02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:48.320]  I said you can just take it off if you want
[02:48:48.320 --> 02:48:50.320]  and he goes no I don't know what's gonna happen
[02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:52.320]  so he goes over
[02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:54.320]  I've paid for stuff I've got my
[02:48:54.320 --> 02:48:56.320]  little cart there with the bags in it
[02:48:56.320 --> 02:48:58.320]  and
[02:48:58.320 --> 02:49:00.320]  I see the little glassed in case
[02:49:00.320 --> 02:49:02.320]  area where the manager is
[02:49:02.320 --> 02:49:04.320]  I just go lean over the thing and start videotaping it
[02:49:04.320 --> 02:49:06.320]  I've got it on my little
[02:49:06.320 --> 02:49:08.320]  globalist tracker system known as an iPhone
[02:49:08.320 --> 02:49:10.320]  I'm going back to the caller but I want to finish the story
[02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:12.320]  so
[02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:14.320]  then they're like well I guess we've got to refund the money
[02:49:14.320 --> 02:49:16.320]  and I go good I'm gonna
[02:49:16.320 --> 02:49:18.320]  expose all this and they go no fine
[02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:20.320]  fine
[02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:22.320]  we'll just put on there that you refuse to do it
[02:49:22.320 --> 02:49:24.320]  and it's this big huge form
[02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:26.320]  all about me and addresses
[02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:28.320]  and registration and driver's license
[02:49:28.320 --> 02:49:30.320]  I mean this is a prison folks
[02:49:30.320 --> 02:49:32.320]  you can't even get a boat
[02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:34.320]  it's not like I'm in Devil's Island or something
[02:49:34.320 --> 02:49:36.320]  you know in a French penal colony
[02:49:36.320 --> 02:49:38.320]  and I left and they came out
[02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:40.320]  to give me the kayak and forgot to give me the
[02:49:40.320 --> 02:49:42.320]  the
[02:49:42.320 --> 02:49:44.320]  or I'm gonna go back in there
[02:49:44.320 --> 02:49:46.320]  and they all shook my hand and said we know what's coming
[02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:48.320]  we know it's true
[02:49:48.320 --> 02:49:50.320]  we're just trying to do our jobs so they were totally different
[02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:52.320]  outside
[02:49:52.320 --> 02:49:54.320]  the manager looked at me and says we know
[02:49:54.320 --> 02:49:56.320]  what's coming we know
[02:49:56.320 --> 02:49:58.320]  we know you're right and the guy that
[02:49:58.320 --> 02:50:00.320]  kind of got in my space shook my hand and I'm like
[02:50:00.320 --> 02:50:02.320]  well then why did you act like that in there
[02:50:02.320 --> 02:50:04.320]  because they were playing a role
[02:50:04.320 --> 02:50:06.320]  look it's a kayak for a little kid
[02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:08.320]  okay it's not an al-qaeda
[02:50:08.320 --> 02:50:10.320]  al-qaeda works for the bankers
[02:50:10.320 --> 02:50:12.320]  I'm sorry I'm ranting I apologize
[02:50:12.320 --> 02:50:14.320]  I'm gonna skip this break so I can finish callers
[02:50:14.320 --> 02:50:16.320]  I apologize I'm out of control today
[02:50:16.320 --> 02:50:18.320]  let's go ahead
[02:50:18.320 --> 02:50:20.320]  and finish up who was I talking to
[02:50:20.320 --> 02:50:22.320]  Alan in New Hampshire okay so you brought up two good
[02:50:22.320 --> 02:50:24.320]  points
[02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:26.320]  big victory with the
[02:50:26.320 --> 02:50:28.320]  with the artificial toxic pink
[02:50:28.320 --> 02:50:30.320]  slime please continue
[02:50:30.320 --> 02:50:32.320]  yeah Roger that
[02:50:32.320 --> 02:50:34.320]  and I'm gonna go ahead and say that
[02:50:34.320 --> 02:50:36.320]  my opinion on this bully epidemic
[02:50:36.320 --> 02:50:38.320]  is a lot to do
[02:50:38.320 --> 02:50:40.320]  with the victim disarmament and people not
[02:50:40.320 --> 02:50:42.320]  you know what happened to the days when you could
[02:50:42.320 --> 02:50:44.320]  take your son who's being bullied out
[02:50:44.320 --> 02:50:46.320]  and teach him some boxing and then have him go
[02:50:46.320 --> 02:50:48.320]  defend himself
[02:50:48.320 --> 02:50:50.320]  that I think is is part of the reason
[02:50:50.320 --> 02:50:52.320]  why it's becoming such an epidemic
[02:50:52.320 --> 02:50:54.320]  and there is such a huge problem
[02:50:54.320 --> 02:50:56.320]  there's a no tolerance with fighting I grew up
[02:50:56.320 --> 02:50:58.320]  I was bullied until I started fighting
[02:50:58.320 --> 02:51:00.320]  back and then you know what I was no longer
[02:51:00.320 --> 02:51:02.320]  bullied me too I think
[02:51:02.320 --> 02:51:04.320]  the best thing ever happened me was being
[02:51:04.320 --> 02:51:06.320]  bullied because my dad said well you
[02:51:06.320 --> 02:51:08.320]  better fight them harder and by the end of it
[02:51:08.320 --> 02:51:10.320]  now I'm not afraid of people
[02:51:10.320 --> 02:51:12.320]  and I post
[02:51:12.320 --> 02:51:14.320]  a ton of stuff on Facebook regarding
[02:51:14.320 --> 02:51:15.320]  government
[02:51:15.320 --> 02:51:16.320]  tyranny
[02:51:16.320 --> 02:51:18.320]  I just recently posted some stuff
[02:51:18.320 --> 02:51:20.320]  about HR 345 where they're
[02:51:20.320 --> 02:51:22.320]  trying to make protesting a felony
[02:51:22.320 --> 02:51:24.320]  and I've noticed that they're all just
[02:51:24.320 --> 02:51:26.320]  a bunch of zombies on Facebook where they
[02:51:26.320 --> 02:51:28.320]  just want to they want to relay
[02:51:28.320 --> 02:51:30.320]  these silly pictures and nobody wants
[02:51:30.320 --> 02:51:32.320]  to read anything worth and
[02:51:32.320 --> 02:51:34.320]  it disgusts me
[02:51:34.320 --> 02:51:36.320]  I got on I was actually
[02:51:36.320 --> 02:51:38.320]  to change the subject real quick I was getting
[02:51:38.320 --> 02:51:40.320]  my hair cut the other day and I started
[02:51:40.320 --> 02:51:42.320]  talking to my barber about
[02:51:42.320 --> 02:51:44.320]  the NDAA and GMOs and the food
[02:51:44.320 --> 02:51:46.320]  and he was really interested because
[02:51:46.320 --> 02:51:48.320]  he has an 11 month old and I started telling
[02:51:48.320 --> 02:51:50.320]  him about all the corn syrup and the
[02:51:50.320 --> 02:51:52.320]  formulas and stuff like that and
[02:51:52.320 --> 02:51:54.320]  then the other barber comes in and tells him
[02:51:54.320 --> 02:51:56.320]  don't listen to this guy he's a conspiracy
[02:51:56.320 --> 02:51:58.320]  theorist so that's how I knew I was
[02:51:58.320 --> 02:52:00.320]  over the mark and hitting well exactly
[02:52:00.320 --> 02:52:02.320]  imagine the average and we've done
[02:52:02.320 --> 02:52:04.320]  a review is why we know we brought him in
[02:52:04.320 --> 02:52:06.320]  and showed him here on air I forget
[02:52:06.320 --> 02:52:08.320]  the name of the show but I should do it again
[02:52:08.320 --> 02:52:10.320]  with Mike Adams and
[02:52:10.320 --> 02:52:12.320]  we were showing the major the three major brands
[02:52:12.320 --> 02:52:14.320]  are all
[02:52:14.320 --> 02:52:16.320]  over 75%
[02:52:16.320 --> 02:52:18.320]  corn syrup and sugar they're all
[02:52:18.320 --> 02:52:20.320]  right at 50 well they're either 49
[02:52:20.320 --> 02:52:22.320]  or 55 if memory serves
[02:52:22.320 --> 02:52:24.320]  corn syrup then there's corn syrup
[02:52:24.320 --> 02:52:26.320]  so it's high fructose
[02:52:26.320 --> 02:52:28.320]  corn syrup rice
[02:52:28.320 --> 02:52:30.320]  sugar it'll just have all these sugars
[02:52:30.320 --> 02:52:32.320]  70 plus percent sugar
[02:52:32.320 --> 02:52:34.320]  ladies and gentlemen I've had
[02:52:34.320 --> 02:52:36.320]  pediatricians on who have broken the matrix
[02:52:36.320 --> 02:52:38.320]  they say maybe
[02:52:38.320 --> 02:52:40.320]  20% of a formula should be
[02:52:40.320 --> 02:52:42.320]  sugar the point is
[02:52:42.320 --> 02:52:44.320]  is that they are we are killing
[02:52:44.320 --> 02:52:46.320]  our children you lovingly
[02:52:46.320 --> 02:52:48.320]  try to warn somebody and you're
[02:52:48.320 --> 02:52:50.320]  the bad man you know what again
[02:52:50.320 --> 02:52:52.320]  that barber made that joke he thinks it's
[02:52:52.320 --> 02:52:54.320]  cute I'd have been listen I don't
[02:52:54.320 --> 02:52:56.320]  appreciate you being condescending buddy
[02:52:56.320 --> 02:52:58.320]  and well actually at first I probably
[02:52:58.320 --> 02:53:00.320]  would have been you know what
[02:53:00.320 --> 02:53:02.320]  corn syrup's really hurting people and America's
[02:53:02.320 --> 02:53:04.320]  corn syrup and then of the guy's smart
[02:53:04.320 --> 02:53:06.320]  mouth again I'd say listen it's not a joke
[02:53:06.320 --> 02:53:08.320]  okay we're really hurting our children
[02:53:08.320 --> 02:53:10.320]  here with this corn syrup and if the guy
[02:53:10.320 --> 02:53:12.320]  bucked up I'd say well actually I wouldn't
[02:53:12.320 --> 02:53:14.320]  say that but the point is is that I'm done
[02:53:14.320 --> 02:53:16.320]  with these people okay because we're
[02:53:16.320 --> 02:53:18.320]  informed doesn't mean we're bad
[02:53:18.320 --> 02:53:20.320]  it doesn't mean we're scum and I'm
[02:53:20.320 --> 02:53:22.320]  sick of people that think it's virtuous
[02:53:22.320 --> 02:53:24.320]  to be ignorant I appreciate your call calls
[02:53:24.320 --> 02:53:26.320]  like that just get my blood up and I'm
[02:53:26.320 --> 02:53:28.320]  telling you I don't need to fill out
[02:53:28.320 --> 02:53:30.320]  two pages of paperwork to get a kayak
[02:53:30.320 --> 02:53:32.320]  I don't need to register it because
[02:53:32.320 --> 02:53:34.320]  the police want it registered
[02:53:34.320 --> 02:53:37.320]  what am I going to do fill it full of
[02:53:37.320 --> 02:53:40.320]  you know corn syrup and put it into the
[02:53:40.320 --> 02:53:44.320]  dam I mean I'm just sick of it this idea
[02:53:44.320 --> 02:53:46.320]  that there's terrorists everywhere oh
[02:53:46.320 --> 02:53:48.320]  they're terrorists another 50 plus heads
[02:53:48.320 --> 02:53:50.320]  got found on the US Mexico border
[02:53:50.320 --> 02:53:52.320]  people are getting stabbed and murdered
[02:53:52.320 --> 02:53:54.320]  and shot all over the place and the police
[02:53:54.320 --> 02:53:56.320]  aren't showing up to help them because they're
[02:53:56.320 --> 02:53:58.320]  too busy writing tickets under orders
[02:53:58.320 --> 02:54:01.320]  all over England the and I'm not bashing
[02:54:01.320 --> 02:54:03.320]  Eastern Europeans they come from rough
[02:54:03.320 --> 02:54:06.320]  places crime riddled they are stabbing
[02:54:06.320 --> 02:54:10.320]  and killing people in England and no
[02:54:10.320 --> 02:54:12.320]  one's defending them and the police can't
[02:54:12.320 --> 02:54:14.320]  ever find out who did it and they won't I
[02:54:14.320 --> 02:54:18.320]  mean again this is serious business
[02:54:18.320 --> 02:54:21.320]  I don't know how these calls make me so
[02:54:21.320 --> 02:54:23.320]  angry I try not to get angry ladies and
[02:54:23.320 --> 02:54:25.320]  gentlemen because it just drains my
[02:54:25.320 --> 02:54:30.320]  heart it's it's so stupid that they won't
[02:54:30.320 --> 02:54:32.320]  let kids defend themselves everywhere of
[02:54:32.320 --> 02:54:34.320]  course that's why bullying is exploding
[02:54:34.320 --> 02:54:36.320]  that was my point about England of course
[02:54:36.320 --> 02:54:39.320]  it is let me tell you something as soon
[02:54:39.320 --> 02:54:41.320]  as I started fighting back even though the
[02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:43.320]  guys were two or three four years older
[02:54:43.320 --> 02:54:45.320]  than me you know who'd flunk grade after
[02:54:45.320 --> 02:54:47.320]  grade should have been sophomores in
[02:54:47.320 --> 02:54:49.320]  high school you know in seventh grade
[02:54:49.320 --> 02:54:51.320]  with mustaches as soon as I started
[02:54:51.320 --> 02:54:54.320]  fighting back they moved on to somebody

[02:56:08.320 --> 02:56:10.320]  a couple strike a brigade guys just
[02:56:10.320 --> 02:56:13.320]  fresh back from Afghanistan having a
[02:56:13.320 --> 02:56:15.320]  good day at the lake I had a question
[02:56:15.320 --> 02:56:17.320]  for Joe Wallach my daughter says that
[02:56:17.320 --> 02:56:20.320]  B vitamins make her cry and she won't
[02:56:20.320 --> 02:56:23.320]  take them what's up with that she says
[02:56:23.320 --> 02:56:26.320]  her natural path doctor claims that
[02:56:26.320 --> 02:56:29.320]  the high level of B vitamins are bad for
[02:56:29.320 --> 02:56:32.320]  what's up with that well I mean even
[02:56:32.320 --> 02:56:34.320]  mainstream media which makes me question
[02:56:34.320 --> 02:56:36.320]  it is saying B vitamins and essential
[02:56:36.320 --> 02:56:39.320]  fatty acids are awesome I mean they're
[02:56:39.320 --> 02:56:41.320]  awesome but I guess it might make
[02:56:41.320 --> 02:56:43.320]  somebody more emotional to have their
[02:56:43.320 --> 02:56:46.320]  full brain capacity but I'm telling you
[02:56:46.320 --> 02:56:49.320]  I'll have to ask you now I've never heard
[02:56:49.320 --> 02:56:52.320]  anybody say B vitamins are bad I mean I
[02:56:52.320 --> 02:56:54.320]  don't know how to respond to that she
[02:56:54.320 --> 02:56:56.320]  says she has a natural path doctor
[02:56:56.320 --> 02:56:59.320]  telling her B vitamins are bad right he's
[02:56:59.320 --> 02:57:01.320]  telling her if she's short on him and she
[02:57:01.320 --> 02:57:03.320]  takes them then it you'll have a reaction
[02:57:03.320 --> 02:57:06.320]  that's bad and oh well well I'll tell you
[02:57:06.320 --> 02:57:09.320]  that that's probably true the first time
[02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:12.320]  I took a wheatgrass shot it made me sick
[02:57:12.320 --> 02:57:14.320]  because I just wasn't used to that level
[02:57:14.320 --> 02:57:17.320]  of vitamins and folic acid and then the
[02:57:17.320 --> 02:57:19.320]  next few times it got better and better
[02:57:19.320 --> 02:57:22.320]  and now if I'm ever at the store where
[02:57:22.320 --> 02:57:23.320]  they have them I get them it doesn't make
[02:57:23.320 --> 02:57:25.320]  me feel ill so yeah I mean I guess she
[02:57:25.320 --> 02:57:27.320]  could have a response to that I'm not Dr
[02:57:27.320 --> 02:57:28.320]  Wallach but I'll have to ask you next time
[02:57:28.320 --> 02:57:31.320]  he's on are those guys happy to be home
[02:57:31.320 --> 02:57:33.320]  from Afghanistan they're happy they're here
[02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:35.320]  with their boys fishing having a good
[02:57:35.320 --> 02:57:37.320]  day that's what I thought I heard some
[02:57:37.320 --> 02:57:40.320]  kids in the background yeah they just
[02:57:40.320 --> 02:57:42.320]  got back from multiple deployments you

[02:57:59.320 --> 02:58:01.320]  didn't want to stress no I hear you you
[02:58:01.320 --> 02:58:02.320]  could have asked them about opium

[02:58:08.320 --> 02:58:10.320]  that's all they're doing over there is
