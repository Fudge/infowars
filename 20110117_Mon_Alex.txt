[00:50.480 --> 00:56.640]  joining us from American Patrol he lives on the Arizona Mexico border and he has
[00:56.640 --> 01:02.520]  documented as a congressional advisor and in testimony to Congress that they've
[01:02.520 --> 01:09.160]  never really built any fence on the border that isn't just for show minus
[01:09.160 --> 01:13.720]  some fencing that's been put in in Southern California and that the
[01:13.720 --> 01:20.400]  electronic virtual fence was never designed or meant to work either and of
[01:20.400 --> 01:25.000]  course they've now officially canceled the virtual fence that never was and
[01:25.000 --> 01:30.680]  they've only built small pieces of the 2,000-mile fence that was financed what
[01:30.680 --> 01:35.200]  five years ago and of course it came out in the Associated Press and Fox News
[01:35.200 --> 01:41.480]  that illegal aliens were being used to actually build large parts of the fence
[01:41.480 --> 01:47.600]  and they would put quote drainage tunnels in the fence that a man could walk
[01:47.600 --> 01:53.840]  under and also areas for animals to migrate through that you could drive a
[01:53.840 --> 01:59.640]  18-wheeler through so and then they park the border patrol out there and don't
[01:59.640 --> 02:05.360]  allow them to leave their little firebase and they've got to sit there at
[02:05.360 --> 02:09.800]  night with big lights on and they're not allowed to basically pursue anybody
[02:09.800 --> 02:13.040]  when you're talking about the National Guard so we're gonna have Spencer on the
[02:13.040 --> 02:18.600]  last 30 minutes today to break down what's really happening to give you a
[02:18.600 --> 02:26.080]  real report from the border of what's unfolding now I want to get into all the
[02:26.080 --> 02:32.200]  different important pieces of world news that are out there and also take your
[02:32.200 --> 02:35.920]  phone calls today I'm gonna take a lot of your phone calls throughout the
[02:35.920 --> 02:41.560]  broadcast the toll-free number if you want to discuss who Jen Tao the Chinese
[02:41.560 --> 02:46.040]  president saying that the days of the dollar are limited and that they want
[02:46.040 --> 02:50.560]  to get rid of the dollar as the World Reserve currency as the CFR has always
[02:50.560 --> 02:58.360]  been planning for decades and they want the Chinese currency to be the new
[02:58.360 --> 03:05.680]  World Reserve currency now that's old news for our audience but not old news
[03:05.680 --> 03:10.640]  you know for some of the other people out there who've been informed for a
[03:10.640 --> 03:14.320]  long time or not old news for the globalist who've been engineering all
[03:14.320 --> 03:20.800]  of this but it is new news in a big way for the general public so I'm gonna go
[03:20.800 --> 03:27.200]  over this first it's just really backs up with Stansbury research and others
[03:27.200 --> 03:32.080]  have been talking about and Ron Paul's been talking about but the biggest
[03:32.080 --> 03:38.120]  facet to all of this is it is by design and there is a way to stop this but the
[03:38.120 --> 03:41.800]  globalists have teamed up with this authoritarian dictatorship of the
[03:41.800 --> 03:48.040]  Communist Party they try to rehabilitate their murderous image and they
[03:48.040 --> 03:52.040]  are the all-time record holders for killing the Chinese government says
[03:52.040 --> 03:57.040]  they killed 84 million our government says 64 million the Chinese are
[03:57.040 --> 04:00.720]  governments actually quite proud and has published many state published books
[04:00.720 --> 04:06.200]  about the boiling pots filled with the human flesh and the mass execution and
[04:06.200 --> 04:10.720]  starvation they're very proud of the leap forward the great leap forward and
[04:10.720 --> 04:13.960]  the cultural revolution I mean you cannot make this stuff up this is just
[04:13.960 --> 04:19.200]  pure abject evil and our government and the UN says China is the model China is
[04:19.200 --> 04:24.960]  good by the way they're now stationing for the first time in 16 years Chinese
[04:24.960 --> 04:30.640]  troops in North Korea to menace the South they obviously been doing test

[04:50.040 --> 04:53.680]  all to watch each other and to worry about the ICBM
[04:53.680 --> 04:59.920]  Merv test going on or China openly threatening to attack the US so we'll

[06:12.360 --> 06:15.760]  bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seemed to be

[07:16.760 --> 07:20.960]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[07:20.960 --> 07:26.200]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[07:26.200 --> 07:30.760]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel

[08:32.600 --> 08:35.520]  gonna be here for the next three hours we're gonna give you an in-depth report
[08:35.520 --> 08:40.640]  from the border with Glenn Spencer now they canceled the virtual fence that
[08:40.640 --> 08:47.680]  never was and of course I have stopped work on the imaginary tin foil fencing
[08:47.680 --> 08:54.200]  that they put in for photo ops it is a complete hoax that we have any type of
[08:54.200 --> 08:58.920]  real border security the border security is there to only catch shipments of
[08:58.920 --> 09:03.520]  heroin cocaine and marijuana not controlled by the big mega banks who
[09:03.520 --> 09:08.480]  publicly I mean it's been all over the news the last few months where major
[09:08.480 --> 09:17.800]  banks and admit that we've covered it here in fact guys search Bloomberg major
[09:17.800 --> 09:22.520]  bank admits it's involved in laundering narcotics money because then it'll give
[09:22.520 --> 09:25.520]  you a whole bunch of banks but I don't want to just go from memory I want to
[09:25.520 --> 09:31.440]  actually be able to buy the last 30 minutes have those news articles and I've
[09:31.440 --> 09:34.960]  got the banks names in my head but I have to double check because it's a bit
[09:34.960 --> 09:37.600]  foggy and I want to be a hundred percent the point is they've caught fellow
[09:37.600 --> 09:42.000]  reserve branch banks they've caught the CIA repeatedly they've caught CIA
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.520]  aircraft crashing full of cocaine I've talked to people that are involved in the
[09:46.520 --> 09:51.440]  army with these surveillance blimps and I've talked to border patrol people and
[09:51.440 --> 09:55.200]  it's come out countless times and I saw it in the Austin American statesman years
[09:55.200 --> 10:01.520]  ago the state police caught an 18-wheeler full of pure cocaine and the
[10:01.520 --> 10:05.000]  feds just came and took it and then gave it to a bank they just they just took it
[10:05.000 --> 10:09.640]  and gave it back to the quote owner yeah there it is banks financing
[10:09.640 --> 10:15.960]  Mexico's gangs admitted in Wells Fargo deal and Wells Fargo just had to admit
[10:15.960 --> 10:20.640]  that they were basically laundering drug money and financing the cartels
[10:20.640 --> 10:27.360]  specifically to buy the aircraft weapons you name it in one deal they found 128
[10:27.360 --> 10:33.160]  black suitcases packed with 5.7 tons of cocaine the smugglers had bought the DC
[10:33.160 --> 10:36.520]  Nines with laundered funds they transferred through two of the biggest
[10:36.520 --> 10:41.640]  banks in the U.S. Wacovia Corporation and Bank of America core Bloomberg market
[10:41.640 --> 10:46.760]  magazine reports in its August 2010 issue again they just did the search I
[10:46.760 --> 10:50.560]  told them and you'll get hundreds of news articles every bank you've heard of and
[10:50.560 --> 10:55.120]  every other bank you haven't heard of I mean this is a pure narcotics trafficking
[10:55.120 --> 10:59.800]  state so why shouldn't the U.S. government allow certain defense contractors to
[10:59.800 --> 11:03.160]  run kidnap women and children and if they're gonna do that for decades
[11:03.160 --> 11:06.520]  publicly and get caught constantly and not get in trouble why not go ahead and
[11:06.520 --> 11:10.640]  snuff film the kids their perverts it'll pay even more for that so it comes out
[11:10.640 --> 11:15.080]  mainly in European press about our corporations running snuff films I mean
[11:15.080 --> 11:19.280]  I've read in Italian papers and you name it I mean it's you know little
[11:19.280 --> 11:23.520]  toddlers having their heads blown off I mean I mean our government is Satan
[11:23.520 --> 11:29.400]  incarnate I mean it's just absolute evil anything goes but then I heard local
[11:29.400 --> 11:37.840]  news last week hyper ventilating hyper ventilating on air about there's a bar
[11:37.840 --> 11:41.760]  in downtown Austin and it was all over the news the police department was having
[11:41.760 --> 11:47.600]  press conferences and it was just so serious somebody got a $100 bill
[11:47.600 --> 11:53.840]  counterfeit passed the people at the bar and the bar apologized for taking it
[11:53.840 --> 11:59.720]  and again APD's looking at it they're really concerned right now our criminal
[11:59.720 --> 12:05.440]  government is pumping over if you count all the different programs together 200
[12:05.440 --> 12:12.560]  billion a month a billion 100 billion plus in the quantitative easing program
[12:12.560 --> 12:18.560]  over 100 billion and other programs 200 plus billion dollars a month being pumped
[12:18.560 --> 12:22.960]  out to their subsidiaries worldwide with no public accounting no one the
[12:22.960 --> 12:26.480]  government's allowed to see who it's going to but then later at leaks we find
[12:26.480 --> 12:30.160]  out it's the US media select corporations foreign banks foreign
[12:30.160 --> 12:35.560]  corporations foreign individuals I mean it is just bankers and CIA and
[12:35.560 --> 12:41.840]  government in there stealing everything pension funds that's why they reported
[12:41.840 --> 12:52.120]  back in September 8th 9th and 10th of 2001 2.1 trillion missing from the
[12:52.120 --> 12:56.800]  Pentagon in just the previous two years and a lot of people said well the
[12:56.800 --> 13:00.240]  budget's not even a trillion dollars a year back then for the Pentagon now it's
[13:00.240 --> 13:05.200]  over that how are they stealing trillions that's more than the whole budget it
[13:05.200 --> 13:08.920]  was the pension funds it was the investment funds that's why you're here
[13:08.920 --> 13:12.880]  and now oh a military people you're gonna have to get your own insurance when
[13:12.880 --> 13:17.520]  you get out of military oh you're gonna have to pay for your own food when your
[13:17.520 --> 13:21.760]  arms and legs are blown off when you're in rehabilitation at romstein about to
[13:21.760 --> 13:25.600]  be flown back to the US that's why they've got all these PR charities running
[13:25.600 --> 13:30.160]  now to raise money for the troops you know through the general public because
[13:30.160 --> 13:34.160]  there's not gonna be health care there's not gonna be pensions all of those
[13:34.160 --> 13:39.200]  promises and contracts are being broken and will be completely broken because
[13:39.200 --> 13:45.240]  everything has already been stolen there are thousands and thousands of
[13:45.240 --> 13:50.320]  wealthy brokerage firm and banker execs and stockholders in these banks who are
[13:50.320 --> 13:54.560]  so wealthy I mean you'll read about them purchasing for three billion dollars
[13:54.560 --> 13:58.800]  you know a couple hundred acre island one of hundreds and hundreds off
[13:58.800 --> 14:03.480]  Greece I mean you'll just read about them it just it's unlimited wealth they
[14:03.480 --> 14:08.880]  stole everything it's already gone and you can tell cops this all day the
[14:08.880 --> 14:12.600]  average cop they just on a power trip for the state they just salute the black
[14:12.600 --> 14:16.520]  uniforms and salute the new world order and say doesn't matter if my standard
[14:16.520 --> 14:21.760]  livings going down talking bad about the government is treason huh and I mean it
[14:21.760 --> 14:25.160]  is just and that's why the globalists are moving on every front to just
[14:25.160 --> 14:29.160]  absolutely set a total police state up because they're gonna get away with all
[14:29.160 --> 14:35.560]  of this and there's a method to their madness to fully bankrupt the country
[14:35.560 --> 14:40.000]  so that you are now completely dependent on government to wreck the free market to
[14:40.000 --> 14:44.920]  wreck family farms and ranches to wreck local businesses to wreck main street
[14:44.920 --> 14:50.920]  with the Pentagon run Walmart grid total Pentagon front over 40% of world
[14:50.920 --> 14:57.840]  retail sales integrating in the RFID chips the universal product code just
[14:57.840 --> 15:06.800]  IBM the big six mega banks Microsoft all admitted government subsidiaries through
[15:06.800 --> 15:10.120]  the fascist control grid I know I'm already ranting and I have all this
[15:10.120 --> 15:16.840]  news to get to it's just mind-blowing mind-blowing to watch this happening out
[15:16.840 --> 15:27.080]  in the open and it makes me so frustrated that it's so out in the open
[15:27.080 --> 15:31.480]  and sure people are waking up but not fast enough and the control grid to
[15:31.480 --> 15:35.720]  suppress the awakening and to stop the American people from taking back control
[15:35.720 --> 15:39.400]  of their government and bringing these criminals to justice is just slamming into
[15:39.400 --> 15:42.920]  place don't you understand the globalists have to go to total tyranny they
[15:42.920 --> 15:52.760]  have committed crimes so huge so monstrous so colossal so gargantuan that
[15:52.760 --> 15:58.560]  they must bring in total tyranny to protect themselves and they're and to
[15:58.560 --> 16:06.240]  continue their scam and they've got the general public just so brain damaged and
[16:06.240 --> 16:10.640]  brainwashed and diverted and distracted and the language has been reduced down
[16:10.640 --> 16:14.680]  to almost nothing and the average person just clicks on the computer all day
[16:14.680 --> 16:17.920]  thinking they're getting something done when they're not we're like rats running
[16:17.920 --> 16:22.800]  around in a treadmill and the whole planet is just hurtling towards absolute
[16:22.800 --> 16:29.240]  global depression by design to fold us into the new environmentalist economy
[16:29.240 --> 16:37.240]  which is the plan scarcity and artificial
[16:37.240 --> 16:51.200]  artificial being poor artificial poverty the media making it so fashionable to be
[16:51.200 --> 16:55.600]  into austerity I mean we are being inducted the globalist have publicly
[16:55.600 --> 16:58.680]  made the decision if you go back even a hundred years ago to build a world
[16:58.680 --> 17:02.320]  government to go with the authoritarian model and you see it all over the news
[17:02.320 --> 17:05.920]  where they go authoritarianism actually works really well look how good it is in
[17:05.920 --> 17:15.000]  China look how good it is in areas like the model that they're using in
[17:15.000 --> 17:19.640]  Singapore we need that model and of course it's horrible for the individual
[17:19.640 --> 17:23.920]  it's horrible for creativity it's horrible for the economy but they sell
[17:23.920 --> 17:30.360]  this destructive system as if it's good but I got off talking about the border
[17:30.360 --> 17:36.440]  situation and sort of ranting about government crimes banks financed seeing
[17:36.440 --> 17:44.360]  Mexican gangs admitted Wells Fargo deal Bank of America Wacovia all of them just
[17:44.360 --> 17:48.280]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and
[17:48.280 --> 17:55.120]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions just the drug dealer money alone
[17:55.120 --> 18:01.680]  in Wacovia was three hundred and seventy eight point four billion from two
[18:01.680 --> 18:07.120]  thousand four to two thousand and seven three hundred and seventy eight point four
[18:07.120 --> 18:18.520]  billion and and I've heard talk show host talk about me and say Alex Jones is
[18:18.520 --> 18:23.760]  nuts he says the government's involved in narcotics trafficking you're talking
[18:23.760 --> 18:28.040]  about conservatively five hundred billion dollars a year laundered in the US
[18:28.040 --> 18:33.880]  yearly of drug money directly from the source that's not counting the recycling
[18:33.880 --> 18:38.840]  of the drug money through the low-level pushers and then they build giant
[18:38.840 --> 18:43.920]  prisons and put the street level pushers in their prisons which are then
[18:43.920 --> 18:49.720]  colleges to teach others how to drug deal and so we send our kids to college
[18:49.720 --> 18:53.400]  and that's what it is the government pushes the riddle in the Prozac the
[18:53.400 --> 18:58.440]  study show your three to five depending on which study times more likely to use
[18:58.440 --> 19:02.400]  illegal drugs once you've been put on riddling or Prozac or other prescription
[19:02.400 --> 19:06.240]  mind-altering drug so they prime you with that they tell you don't use drugs
[19:06.240 --> 19:09.160]  they tell you how to use the drugs in the dare program which studies show
[19:09.160 --> 19:13.080]  massively increased interest in drugs then the drugs are sold by the low-level
[19:13.080 --> 19:20.600]  government retailer and then when your kid gets caught with marijuana or
[19:20.600 --> 19:25.400]  whatever it is they go to juvie and then in juvie they get inducted they get
[19:25.400 --> 19:30.280]  gang-raped and beat up if they don't become drug dealers for the higher level
[19:30.280 --> 19:35.760]  low-level drug dealers in the in the juvie and by the time they're 25 they've
[19:35.760 --> 19:40.320]  got HIV hundreds of tattoos all over them they they think it's really cool
[19:40.320 --> 19:45.360]  that you know they have gangster speak and have no idea about human history or
[19:45.360 --> 19:51.920]  anything else and now they are zombie goblins outselling the drugs to more
[19:51.920 --> 19:56.080]  people to be inducted into the criminal college to then be pumped back out then
[19:56.080 --> 19:59.240]  the middle class gets scared asked for police state to help them but the police

[24:06.440 --> 24:11.280]  they came and took it
[24:18.500 --> 24:22.840]  the places where I used to be
[24:22.840 --> 24:34.920]  As we get deeper into this new world order, we see what the Trilateral Commission openly
[24:34.920 --> 24:40.680]  wrote about, what the Council on Farm Relations openly wrote about happening.
[24:40.680 --> 24:46.800]  And we know how deep into it we've gotten, and we know because we have a roadmap, the
[24:46.800 --> 24:51.200]  globalists have been public about this, they just have such disdain for the public, they
[24:51.200 --> 24:54.920]  think the public won't read it, won't see it, won't care.
[24:54.920 --> 24:59.080]  And to a great extent, that's true.
[24:59.080 --> 25:03.840]  But a lot of people are waking up, are getting involved, and the globalists admittedly are
[25:03.840 --> 25:08.080]  starting to get concerned, because what they're doing is so bold, and they're counting on
[25:08.080 --> 25:20.960]  it being so bold, so out in the open, so wild, so over the top, that people will, they'll
[25:20.960 --> 25:26.280]  just be overwhelmed by it, and have a sense of hopelessness.
[25:26.280 --> 25:31.160]  But the only hopelessness is if we don't stand up and don't resist.
[25:31.160 --> 25:36.360]  We know if we resist, we've got a great chance of turning this whole situation around.
[25:36.360 --> 25:44.240]  Obviously, it is big news all over the world today, what Hu Jintao, the Chinese President
[25:44.240 --> 25:49.920]  said yesterday ahead of his visit, coming up in two days, on Wednesday to the United
[25:49.920 --> 25:55.600]  States, who questions future role of U.S. dollar?
[25:55.600 --> 26:01.160]  Now, this would be bad enough if we were like Mexico, devaluing its currency, but still
[26:01.160 --> 26:03.880]  had exports.
[26:03.880 --> 26:09.520]  But the fact that we've been hollowed out industrially, the fact that our industrial
[26:09.520 --> 26:16.680]  system has been purposefully transferred to China through taxing and environmental rules
[26:16.680 --> 26:21.040]  that made it almost impossible to operate here in the U.S., the fact that the big megabanks
[26:21.040 --> 26:26.240]  gave unlimited loans to the Communist Chinese because they were authoritarian and inside
[26:26.240 --> 26:33.920]  deals could be made, means that when the dollar begins to accelerate into the depths of its
[26:33.920 --> 26:42.280]  final decline, it is going to have unprecedented effects on our way of life.
[26:42.280 --> 26:48.360]  When you start thinking about what it will do to people on fixed incomes, what oil and
[26:48.360 --> 26:52.800]  food prices and commodities prices going up is already doing, and we haven't seen the
[26:52.800 --> 26:55.920]  tip of the proverbial iceberg yet.
[26:55.920 --> 27:02.320]  What it's going to do to people's savings in the bank, what it's going to do to Americans'
[27:02.320 --> 27:09.000]  capacity who are running retail systems to buy these cheap goods that are made in China
[27:09.000 --> 27:16.480]  to sell them, just across the board, it is a very, very dangerous time that we're entering.
[27:16.480 --> 27:22.920]  As people make less money, it's going to be harder for them to buy the products they need,
[27:22.920 --> 27:27.640]  and meanwhile the media just continues to lie and behave like everything is fine and
[27:27.640 --> 27:32.920]  that we've come out of the recession a year and a half ago and things look great in 2011,
[27:32.920 --> 27:39.280]  while the globalists themselves in the G20 communiques, in their country to country
[27:39.280 --> 27:46.840]  communications, they're like, brace yourselves, total collapse, food riots, global geopolitical
[27:46.840 --> 27:53.800]  overthrows going on, I mean, we're entering a very volatile time by design that they openly
[27:53.800 --> 27:57.440]  say they're going to create a world government on the other end of.
[27:57.440 --> 28:02.520]  They've already got the system in place, now they're emerging publicly, they're now admitting
[28:02.520 --> 28:08.240]  the world government is being established, and selling it as if it is the solution,
[28:08.240 --> 28:19.920]  when it is the creator, the fount, the progenitor, the culprit of what we see now taking place.
[28:19.920 --> 28:26.920]  So who questions future role of U.S. dollar, China's President Hu Jintao has raised questions
[28:26.920 --> 28:30.480]  on the role of the U.S. dollar in the global monetary system on the eve of a state visit
[28:30.480 --> 28:34.880]  to Washington saying the current international currency system is a product of the past and
[28:34.880 --> 28:39.680]  that the dollar will be replaced and that he wants it to be replaced by the Chinese
[28:39.680 --> 28:43.480]  currency.
[28:43.480 --> 28:45.480]  I mean, that is so incredible.
[28:45.480 --> 28:48.320]  Here's another one out of the Wall Street Journal.
[28:48.320 --> 28:53.880]  Who highlights need for U.S.-China cooperation questions the dollar, and you can go on and
[28:53.880 --> 29:06.160]  read his quotes here about, he talks about how we can both gain from a sound China-U.S.
[29:06.160 --> 29:08.880]  relationship and lose from confrontation.
[29:08.880 --> 29:12.440]  So he's saying, just go along with it.
[29:12.440 --> 29:16.840]  We've got the money, we will build the super trains in the U.S.
[29:16.840 --> 29:18.080]  We will own your ports.
[29:18.080 --> 29:22.040]  We will literally own and control Walmart.
[29:22.040 --> 29:25.040]  We will run your country.
[29:25.040 --> 29:27.600]  And China has signed on to the new world order.
[29:27.600 --> 29:29.840]  They said, you're going to give us unlimited development.
[29:29.840 --> 29:32.760]  You're going to make us the main engine of world government in the 70s.
[29:32.760 --> 29:34.680]  We'll have one-child policies.
[29:34.680 --> 29:36.880]  We'll forcibly abort babies.
[29:36.880 --> 29:39.760]  We'll let you use newborn babies for medical experiments.
[29:39.760 --> 29:42.680]  We are completely vampiric and cold-blooded.
[29:42.680 --> 29:45.920]  And David Rockefeller said, you are given the crown of Satan.
[29:45.920 --> 29:49.000]  You are now the king, prepared to destroy the U.S.
[29:49.000 --> 29:51.200]  They said, absolutely, we love it.
[29:51.200 --> 29:54.920]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:54.920 --> 29:58.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[31:00.480 --> 31:05.120]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[31:05.120 --> 31:09.440]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[31:09.440 --> 31:13.760]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[31:13.760 --> 31:15.080]  allows you to have.
[31:15.080 --> 31:16.080]  It's true.
[31:16.080 --> 31:20.840]  All government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[31:20.840 --> 31:25.160]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[31:25.160 --> 31:29.160]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[31:29.160 --> 31:32.640]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[31:32.640 --> 31:36.360]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[31:36.360 --> 31:41.080]  Number five, a solar-powered generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[31:41.080 --> 31:44.880]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[31:44.880 --> 31:46.280]  one of my oldest sponsors.

[33:32.040 --> 33:35.560]  time callers today after I go through this bank of callers.
[33:35.560 --> 33:39.260]  I notice the lines are already loaded, but I want to give first time callers a chance
[33:39.260 --> 33:45.440]  after we talk to these folks to give us their take on China saying, hey, we'll all gain
[33:45.440 --> 33:50.080]  from working together, we'll lose by confrontation.
[33:50.080 --> 33:56.120]  As the United States does drills off the coast, as China does drills off our coast, as Chinese
[33:56.120 --> 34:05.120]  troops pour into North Korea, that's in AFP and Reuters today, the first time since 1994
[34:05.120 --> 34:13.120]  when tensions last crested, of course we had a war via surrogate, via proxy, with China
[34:13.120 --> 34:18.480]  during the Korean War and the Vietnam War, while the Rockefellers, Armin Hammer and others
[34:18.480 --> 34:26.960]  on record owned and controlled the steel plants and the stock in Opal, subdivision of GM, and
[34:26.960 --> 34:32.400]  of course Ford, building the trucks, building the weapons, building the missiles in Russia
[34:32.400 --> 34:39.120]  and China to then be shipped and allowed to land in the North at the harbor, U.S. submarines
[34:39.120 --> 34:45.600]  didn't touch them, you're like, well what was the globalist goal, have a war, get the
[34:45.600 --> 34:50.200]  troops hooked on opium, bring them back, those that didn't get hooked on opium got hooked
[34:50.200 --> 34:56.520]  on killing, make them cops, bring the corrupt drug dealing troops in, have them run CIA drug
[34:56.520 --> 35:02.000]  dealing nationwide, I mean this is on record, you know how many Army officers I've talked
[35:02.000 --> 35:09.280]  to who are retired, who the CIA tried to recruit to deal drugs in the U.S.?
[35:09.280 --> 35:16.000]  I mean I know a couple Army officers in my family and they were all approached and said
[35:16.000 --> 35:23.720]  no, I mean America is run by pure evil, don't people get it?
[35:23.720 --> 35:29.480]  The globalists are totally ruthless, they run both sides and they don't run the individual
[35:29.480 --> 35:33.600]  American and they don't have full control over our media, those vestiges of the free
[35:33.600 --> 35:37.120]  press are still there, that's why they're trying to come in and shut down alternative
[35:37.120 --> 35:43.120]  media, that's why they're trying to demonize people that are pushing and promoting liberty.
[35:43.120 --> 35:47.760]  Because they know that they're coming to the end of the cycle and they either have to get
[35:47.760 --> 35:52.840]  more tyranny in place or they're going to be brought to justice, it's either more tyranny
[35:52.840 --> 35:56.640]  is going to take place and hardcore degradation or we're going to start back in the other
[35:56.640 --> 36:02.640]  direction and we're at that key balancing point, that flux point right now.
[36:02.640 --> 36:07.920]  Who calls currency system product of the past AFP?
[36:07.920 --> 36:15.000]  Who highlights need for U.S.-China cooperation questions dollar?
[36:15.000 --> 36:20.080]  Who questions future role for U.S. dollar and he goes on to say the dollar is a thing
[36:20.080 --> 36:23.960]  of the past but he said how do we replace it with their currency?
[36:23.960 --> 36:27.640]  Now what did I tell you a month or two ago, a month and a half ago, that announcement
[36:27.640 --> 36:33.080]  with Putin and Hu Jintao, Vladimir Putin and Hu Jintao of China, the prime minister
[36:33.080 --> 36:37.000]  of Russia and the president of China said we're now only going to engage in country
[36:37.000 --> 36:42.040]  to country trade, which is huge, especially in raw materials from Russia to China, finished
[36:42.040 --> 36:46.200]  goods from China to Russia, in the Chinese currency.
[36:46.200 --> 36:50.280]  Well first they said we're going to trade amongst each ourselves, we haven't decided
[36:50.280 --> 36:54.000]  on the currency yet and I clearly, it's not going to be the ruble, so I said you watch
[36:54.000 --> 36:57.200]  it's going to be the Chinese currency and then it was, they announced that just three
[36:57.200 --> 36:59.160]  weeks ago.
[36:59.160 --> 37:02.440]  So a month and a half ago they announced they're going to trade with a new currency, then they
[37:02.440 --> 37:07.880]  announced a month ago or so, three weeks ago that it's going to be between the two nations.
[37:07.880 --> 37:13.040]  I mean this is happening now.
[37:13.040 --> 37:18.840]  Yon ruble trade starts as Russia-China shun dollar, Bloomberg, yeah it's December 15th
[37:18.840 --> 37:22.240]  or three weeks ago, almost four weeks ago.
[37:22.240 --> 37:28.960]  So all of that is going on, then meanwhile the globalists have to crack down with this
[37:28.960 --> 37:32.600]  police state here domestically so they've got to launch false flags attacks.
[37:32.600 --> 37:38.520]  Now if you go back in mid-September and in Kurt Nemo's article he breaks all this down
[37:38.520 --> 37:44.600]  and has the video of yours truly Alex Jones in September breaking down exactly what would
[37:44.600 --> 37:48.360]  happen and again I'm not bragging I broke down exactly what happened, I'm saying we
[37:48.360 --> 37:52.840]  know what we're talking about, this stuff's all hidden in plain view, go read Kurt Nemo's
[37:52.840 --> 37:58.000]  article and then watch the 15 minute video where I said what was going to happen.
[37:58.000 --> 38:03.240]  I said it's going to come out that Israel and the US together designed this, it's going
[38:03.240 --> 38:09.320]  to come out that Israel launched it and they're going to use it to call for the end of internet
[38:09.320 --> 38:13.240]  freedom as we know it and the cyber security takeover of the web and they're going to
[38:13.240 --> 38:19.360]  launch further false flag attacks on the web but that will happen after they hype up that
[38:19.360 --> 38:20.600]  the attacks are coming.
[38:20.600 --> 38:23.120]  What do 9,000 locations have going in right now?
[38:23.120 --> 38:25.480]  Giant telescreens, what are they now announcing?
[38:25.480 --> 38:29.360]  Cyber security attack, prepare for it, don't trust the web, the feds have to take over
[38:29.360 --> 38:31.280]  the web to protect it.
[38:31.280 --> 38:37.240]  So they're now entering that sector of a false flag attack on the web, they're now beginning
[38:37.240 --> 38:38.640]  to parrot that.
[38:38.640 --> 38:42.160]  When they bring in the full depression, the full dollar devaluation, are they going to
[38:42.160 --> 38:44.280]  let people be on the air?
[38:44.280 --> 38:47.840]  Probably not folks, they'll probably trump something up if they go ahead with this, we're
[38:47.840 --> 38:51.200]  right up to the stalemate right now.
[38:51.200 --> 38:55.400]  They're waiting to move with total martial law, they're waiting to move with total oppression,
[38:55.400 --> 38:59.400]  total tyranny, right now they're lined up on our border like Hitler lined up on the
[38:59.400 --> 39:01.200]  Polish border.
[39:01.200 --> 39:05.680]  Now if we stand up to them and tell them we know what they're doing and if we have courage
[39:05.680 --> 39:10.240]  they may back off and may back step as Lindsay Williams said yesterday.
[39:10.240 --> 39:11.920]  These people are not invincible.
[39:11.920 --> 39:15.280]  And they think you're going to go along with it though, they are going to do it.
[39:15.280 --> 39:18.640]  Now I told you the government launched that attack.
[39:18.640 --> 39:25.560]  And here it is, Israel test on worm called crucial in Iran nuclear deal delay, again Israel's
[39:25.560 --> 39:33.160]  test on worm called crucial in Iran nuclear delay, and then they have the U.S. government
[39:33.160 --> 39:40.880]  and others saying that they tested the jointly made superworm at the Israeli Demona nuclear
[39:40.880 --> 39:45.600]  facility because they have similar centrifuges and computers as to the Iranians and that they
[39:45.600 --> 39:48.080]  worked with Israel and then launched it.
[39:48.080 --> 39:52.880]  Now the issue here is they launched it and then they came out a month later, this is
[39:52.880 --> 39:59.880]  three months ago, a month into it, they launched it three and a half months ago and I predicted
[39:59.880 --> 40:06.120]  and they did a month later, now two months ago, that they would then say see we've got
[40:06.120 --> 40:11.360]  to have cybersecurity takeover of the web and NATO's announcing they've got to track
[40:11.360 --> 40:15.040]  everybody in real time which they're already doing, they're just letting you now know that
[40:15.040 --> 40:21.080]  you have no privacy, no fourth amendment in Europe, they have similar laws about illegal
[40:21.080 --> 40:24.560]  wiretapping and authoritarian systems, they're just saying we don't care it's to protect
[40:24.560 --> 40:25.560]  you.
[40:25.560 --> 40:29.880]  When NATO is again the European arm of the narcotics trade, child kidnapping all over
[40:29.880 --> 40:34.240]  the news and they're going to protect you from the child kidnapping and the drugs they're
[40:34.240 --> 40:36.640]  now announcing.
[40:36.640 --> 40:42.040]  Satan is going to protect you from BLCB, BLCB is going to protect you from Bathomet, Bathomet
[40:42.040 --> 40:47.760]  is going to protect you from Leviathan, Leviathan is going to protect you from SET, SET is going
[40:47.760 --> 40:50.240]  to protect you from the old serpent.
[40:50.240 --> 40:59.460]  The old serpent is going to protect you from the devil, confirmed Stuxnet was false flag
[40:59.460 --> 41:05.780]  launched by Israel and the United States. And on Saturday, the gray lady of establishment
[41:05.780 --> 41:10.580]  propaganda, the New York Times passively admitted that the Stuxnet virus responsible for crippling
[41:10.580 --> 41:15.740]  Iran's nuclear energy program and bouncing back to the US was engineered by Israel and
[41:15.740 --> 41:24.340]  the US intelligence. And it goes on. It goes on to break it all down. Let me just read
[41:24.340 --> 41:28.500]  to you from the New York Times and we'll go to your calls. Israel test on worm called
[41:28.500 --> 41:34.220]  crucial in Iran nuclear delay. The Demona complex at the Negev desert is famous as the
[41:34.220 --> 41:39.740]  heavily guarded heart of Israel's never acknowledged nuclear arms program. It's all admitted in
[41:39.740 --> 41:44.800]  it. But then if they don't say so, then we're not allowed to talk about it. Where neat rows
[41:44.800 --> 41:49.660]  of factories make atomic fuel for the arsenal over the past two years, according to intelligence,
[41:49.660 --> 41:55.060]  the military experts familiar with its operations. Demona has taken on a new equally secretive
[41:55.060 --> 42:00.220]  role as a critical testing ground in a joint America and Israeli effort to undermine Iran's
[42:00.220 --> 42:06.620]  efforts to make a bomb of its own. Behind Demona's barbed wire, the experts say Israel
[42:06.620 --> 42:14.620]  has spun nuclear centrifuges virtually identical to Iran's where Iranian scientists are struggling
[42:14.620 --> 42:18.660]  to enrich uranium. They say Demona tested the effectiveness of the Stuxnet computer
[42:18.660 --> 42:22.980]  worm, a destructive program that appears to have wiped out roughly a fifth of Iran's
[42:22.980 --> 42:27.740]  nuclear centrifuges and helped delay, though not destroyed Tehran's ability to make its
[42:27.740 --> 42:34.180]  first nuclear arms. To check out the worm, you have to know the machines said American
[42:34.180 --> 42:38.980]  expert of nuclear intelligence. The reason the worm has been effective is the Israelis
[42:38.980 --> 42:45.860]  tried it out. So there they are just admitting all this, but then simultaneously Kurt's
[42:45.860 --> 42:52.620]  article links to J. Rockefeller, Lieberman, and a bunch of others in the last couple months
[42:52.620 --> 42:57.500]  saying we've got to give up internet freedom. We've got to have the Pentagon through cybersecurity
[42:57.500 --> 43:03.500]  takeover the entire web. If you have an ISP company with more than 100 customers, you've
[43:03.500 --> 43:08.740]  got to take government training and they're now announcing and get a government license
[43:08.740 --> 43:13.260]  to even operate internet servers and that you've got to put pieces of equipment in.
[43:13.260 --> 43:18.100]  They say that openly snoop on everything. This goes back to the 96 telecommunications
[43:18.100 --> 43:27.260]  act where they paid $9 billion to the major telecoms to put the whole buildings and whole
[43:27.260 --> 43:35.100]  floors added on to the AT&T and other systems that everything then runs through. But see,
[43:35.100 --> 43:39.500]  the big company said give us money to do that. With little people, they just say you're an
[43:39.500 --> 43:44.780]  indentured servant, indentured servant too. We don't care if it violates constitution.
[43:44.780 --> 43:50.660]  You will put in all this equipment. Kind of like the EAS system under FEMA in 96. It didn't
[43:50.660 --> 43:58.140]  pay cable, broadcast TV, UHF, EHF, AM, FM, shortwave to put an EAS FEMA box in at the
[43:58.140 --> 44:04.740]  transmitter remote control controlled by shortwave. Now by satellite where every radio station
[44:04.740 --> 44:08.860]  in the country under FCC licensure is under full government control and you have to pay
[44:08.860 --> 44:15.100]  for that. Well, now they're just going to wire basically EAS software into everything.
[44:15.100 --> 44:21.460]  And what do they say they need it for? Because the Chinese launched the Stuxnet or the Russians
[44:21.460 --> 44:27.220]  did sure and the Easter bunnies did too. The Pentagon has to take the web over. They
[44:27.220 --> 44:31.260]  have to get rid of your speech. They have to recruit all the young kids out of high
[44:31.260 --> 44:35.300]  school to be part of their new cybersecurity army. They have to put up big telescreens
[44:35.300 --> 44:39.380]  in all the major shops and shopping malls. Now going in now telling you to watch out
[44:39.380 --> 44:44.140]  on the Internet and watch your neighbors because they're getting ready to hammer the Internet.
[44:44.140 --> 44:48.380]  They're getting ready to tax it. They're getting ready to have Internet ID tracking you where
[44:48.380 --> 44:53.580]  you go. That was put in four years ago into all the Microsoft operating systems. It's
[44:53.580 --> 44:58.220]  just there waiting that little kernel. But now Obama announces it last week. Yes, for
[44:58.220 --> 45:04.300]  the children's safety. Right as NATO announces it. The total grid going into place right
[45:04.300 --> 45:10.300]  now. And they're doing it all after the U.S. and Israel launched the Stuxnet. And we wrote
[45:10.300 --> 45:13.940]  an article about this and I saw comments on Info Wars and an article saying, how dare
[45:13.940 --> 45:21.620]  you attack Israel, you traitor. How dare you, Jones, you know, you're going to get it.
[45:21.620 --> 45:25.060]  Because I'm reporting that Israel and the U.S. government have launched yet another
[45:25.060 --> 45:31.420]  false flag and then publicly brag about it and say, I've got to give up my free speech
[45:31.420 --> 45:36.300]  for the love of Israel's corruption. And then there's the other Schizophrenics in their
[45:36.300 --> 45:42.420]  commenting. Look at Jones covering up for Israel again. Schizophrenically, as I called
[45:42.420 --> 45:48.300]  up Kurt Sunday and we wrote that article together. I told Kurt the areas I thought were important,
[45:48.300 --> 45:52.780]  send him over some of the links and statements, then we collaborated on that article. I mean,
[45:52.780 --> 45:57.820]  this is the insanity of people trying to make everything about Alex Jones. Either I'm bad
[45:57.820 --> 46:05.060]  for talking about what Israel's up to or I'm not hating Israel properly. Well, the truth
[46:05.060 --> 46:08.660]  is I don't hate Israel. I don't hate China. I don't hate Germany. I don't hate the U.S.
[46:08.660 --> 46:13.500]  I hate the corrupt forces that are in there, but it isn't about Alex Jones. And that's
[46:13.500 --> 46:18.180]  this mental illness that I'm sick of. It isn't about me. We've all been trained to fight
[46:18.180 --> 46:23.380]  with each other. Have you ever gone crab fishing? I mean, you could just take a piece of bacon
[46:23.380 --> 46:29.660]  or a piece of ham and throw it in. No hook. Just a weight. And the crabs are so greedy
[46:29.660 --> 46:33.780]  that you can slowly pull them up like a dog. You know, you're playing tug of war with.
[46:33.780 --> 46:37.740]  You can slowly pull up a crab and then have your net and grab them up. And when you got
[46:37.740 --> 46:41.940]  about five or six crabs in the big bucket, they'll be trying to crawl out. And if they
[46:41.940 --> 46:48.620]  work together like fire ants, they would get out. But when they don't attack each other
[46:48.620 --> 46:54.660]  till one tries to climb out and leave, misery likes company. And when one crab starts trying
[46:54.660 --> 46:59.320]  to climb out to get away, the others come over and grab them. And I was going through
[46:59.320 --> 47:04.620]  some of my YouTube videos, the fluoride video we launched and another one about how they're
[47:04.620 --> 47:08.900]  training citizens to spy on each other and saying, if somebody buys guns or somebody's
[47:08.900 --> 47:13.660]  talking about politically controversial things, go ahead and call Homeland Security on them.
[47:13.660 --> 47:16.980]  And I was covering that in the video. And so I was, you know, just seeing the hit counts
[47:16.980 --> 47:23.380]  and I'm like, Oh, 80,000 in three days. That's not bad. Oh, only 25,000 views in two days
[47:23.380 --> 47:28.060]  on my fluoride special. It's 10 minutes long and documents it. Man, you know, that's too
[47:28.060 --> 47:32.300]  bad. I wish it was seen being seen by more. And I looked down at the first comments and
[47:32.300 --> 47:44.580]  it said, Alex Jones is pure scum. He's not having attorney crier on who got a jury trial
[47:44.580 --> 47:51.740]  and found that the IRS, you know, was basically unconstitutional and that he got off in a
[47:51.740 --> 47:57.540]  jury trial on failure to file. What a piece of trash. What a coward. What an agent. And
[47:57.540 --> 48:01.660]  I just looked at that and I wasn't, I wasn't hurt by the fact that he was calling me a
[48:01.660 --> 48:11.220]  coward and an agent and scum. I was hurt by the fact that I looked at the guy's channel
[48:11.220 --> 48:14.980]  and he had a lot of good videos and things on there and a lot of interviews I've done
[48:14.980 --> 48:20.260]  with people, you know, the good fruit that I've provided, the good work I've done, not
[48:20.260 --> 48:30.060]  because I want accolades, but because I want to defeat tyranny. I want a future and I've
[48:30.060 --> 48:33.220]  interviewed Tommy Crier, I think three or four times on that subject. I've interviewed
[48:33.220 --> 48:38.380]  Joe Bannister. I invited Joe Bannister to come speak at both my speeches in California.
[48:38.380 --> 48:45.180]  It's like, it's like, it isn't about Israel working with the U.S., launching the Stuxnet
[48:45.180 --> 48:51.420]  and trying to use it to take our free speech away in America. And we have direct connections
[48:51.420 --> 48:55.580]  through Lieberman and others who we know are dual Israeli agents openly saying take our
[48:55.580 --> 48:59.860]  free speech. And so we write an article about it and say it's wrong for Israel to launch
[48:59.860 --> 49:04.220]  this false flag on us and then try to take our free speech so we can just be a milk cow
[49:04.220 --> 49:11.900]  to supply money and weapons systems that they then sell to China. And then I criticize for
[49:11.900 --> 49:17.340]  telling the truth by people. I mean, Israel admits they helped launch this false flag.
[49:17.340 --> 49:25.020]  I just tell the truth. And so I get bashed and, you know, told I'm anti-Semitic because
[49:25.020 --> 49:29.020]  it has nothing to do with that. I'm exposing a corrupt government. It's like they say,
[49:29.020 --> 49:34.620]  why are you anti-Asian? Because you're exposing China. I've been asked that by media. No,
[49:34.620 --> 49:40.780]  am I anti-German because I criticize Hitler? Or have I criticized the fictitious Don Carlioni
[49:40.780 --> 49:46.260]  or somebody real like John Gotti, am I anti-Italian? I mean, this is mental illness. This is how
[49:46.260 --> 49:50.900]  people have been trained to be dishonest, intellectually dishonest, delusional. And
[49:50.900 --> 49:55.940]  just because people have woken up to the New World Order, they haven't woken up. Again,
[49:55.940 --> 50:00.780]  I don't grieve because so many people lie about me and who I am and build these straw
[50:00.780 --> 50:07.380]  men about me and attack someone who isn't Alex Jones. I get upset for them because
[50:07.380 --> 50:12.980]  a lot of them aren't agents. They really think I've supported the IRS. They really think
[50:12.980 --> 50:19.660]  I'm promoting the Federal Reserve. It's owner. And so we can't have a debate about Israel
[50:19.660 --> 50:25.540]  running false flags or trying to save the Internet. It's got to be how Alex Jones works
[50:25.540 --> 50:31.220]  for Israel or schizophrenically, how Alex Jones is attacking innocent little Israel when
[50:31.220 --> 50:36.700]  Israel is admittedly here helping launch the Stuxnet, which then our government is using
[50:36.700 --> 50:42.780]  to take my free speech away. It isn't about Alex Jones. It's about preserving free speech,
[50:42.780 --> 50:48.740]  property rights, the right to self-defense, the family. I mean, if you've got those things
[50:48.740 --> 50:52.380]  and a relationship with God and know there's something bigger than yourself, you've got
[50:52.380 --> 50:58.460]  the engine of liberty and freedom. It isn't about Alex Jones, folks. It's about waking
[50:58.460 --> 51:00.580]  up and fighting tyranny. Don't you get it?
[51:00.580 --> 51:05.140]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[51:05.140 --> 51:09.980]  seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[51:09.980 --> 51:13.780]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have
[51:13.780 --> 51:17.300]  outperformed even gold and silver before in this country. And it's possible that could
[51:17.300 --> 51:21.860]  even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect
[51:21.860 --> 51:28.040]  mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply
[51:28.040 --> 51:32.580]  of nutrient-dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have
[51:32.580 --> 51:36.740]  not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant
[51:36.740 --> 51:44.100]  a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com
[51:44.100 --> 51:55.340]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,
[51:55.340 --> 52:00.860]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[52:00.860 --> 52:06.060]  They helped to create a new world order. We are part of a new world order. A new world
[52:06.060 --> 52:11.780]  order based upon collective action. Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists
[52:11.780 --> 52:16.540]  through their own words and documents. The new world order really is a tool for addressing
[52:16.540 --> 52:21.300]  a new world of possibilities. It means all the world under their control. The United
[52:21.300 --> 52:26.940]  Nations would take over America. The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world. Invisible
[52:26.940 --> 52:32.580]  Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish
[52:32.580 --> 52:37.100]  an oppressive world government. I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short
[52:37.100 --> 52:41.660]  of a world constitution for the global financial system. Global governance with the establishment
[52:41.660 --> 52:46.660]  of the G20. So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I've got
[52:46.660 --> 52:53.500]  news for you. You're everyone else. Invisible Empire. Secure your copy today at infowars.com

[54:06.300 --> 54:17.460]  I'm going to stop hogging the broadcast for myself here. It's just that we've all got
[54:17.460 --> 54:24.620]  to hang together or hang separate and they are coming after the internet. They are coming
[54:24.620 --> 54:30.220]  out for free speech. They are going to run more hoaxes like the Tucson shooter who it
[54:30.220 --> 54:37.540]  now admits was an absolute liberal Bush hater. That's even in the New York Times. I told
[54:37.540 --> 54:41.300]  you eight days ago he was clearly a cross dressing devil worshiper. I know the MO of
[54:41.300 --> 54:47.420]  that crew. I studied different strata of society. I knew the music he was into. All of it. Boom.
[54:47.420 --> 54:52.340]  New instantly. It's only devil worshippers dressing up like grim reapers that can go
[54:52.340 --> 54:57.420]  around killing people. They are into it. What do you think the Nazis did? They dressed up
[54:57.420 --> 55:01.700]  in black outfits and wore skulls on their hat. When you are wearing skulls on your
[55:01.700 --> 55:07.140]  hat, folks, you are evil. When you wear your flag openly, our troops would never have skulls
[55:07.140 --> 55:13.940]  on their uniforms until World War II. They started adopting some of the Nazi stuff and
[55:13.940 --> 55:18.500]  then now today it's just skulls, 666 all over the helicopters. I see it on the news all
[55:18.500 --> 55:25.460]  the time. When you start putting 666 on your helicopter, your tank, or got human skulls,
[55:25.460 --> 55:31.620]  rotten heads on the front of your Abrams tank, those guys are coming back to be cops.
[55:31.620 --> 55:37.980]  You think they're going to stop driving around listening to death metal and blaring the drowning
[55:37.980 --> 55:46.180]  pool. Then we see some guy taking hallucinogens every day who gets into really destructive
[55:46.180 --> 55:49.500]  type music, even if you don't believe in God and the devil. They are tuning into that
[55:49.500 --> 55:58.540]  archetype. They are tuning in and manifesting a love of death and destruction. But you notice
[55:58.540 --> 56:05.300]  I am 100 and 80 degrees the opposite direction from somebody like this guy, but I'm still
[56:05.300 --> 56:10.660]  being blamed for him in the news. Long after they are not blaming Sarah Palin and Rush
[56:10.660 --> 56:16.140]  Limbaugh anymore, they are still today in the news blaming yours truly. I always get
[56:16.140 --> 56:20.700]  to blame. And why is that from every side? Because I'm real, ladies and gentlemen, and
[56:20.700 --> 56:24.860]  people can't believe there's somebody bold and real and legitimate. Doesn't mean I'm
[56:24.860 --> 56:33.660]  perfect. I fund my operation as best I can, most revolutionaries in history. Rob banks
[56:33.660 --> 56:38.940]  founding fathers with Rob British banks to fund themselves. I don't do that. I'm pretty
[56:38.940 --> 56:45.180]  darn moral. I try to be moral, but it doesn't mean I'm perfect. But I want freedom. I want
[56:45.180 --> 56:49.980]  decency. I want to be honorable. I want to be strong. I want to be credible. I want to
[56:49.980 --> 56:53.940]  help people and the new world order knows that. And that's why they build up strong
[56:53.940 --> 56:59.500]  men at every level of national media, local media, alternative media. They build strong
[56:59.500 --> 57:06.340]  men of who I'm not and then say I am that bad thing as an attempt to tear down the image
[57:06.340 --> 57:12.980]  of Alex Jones, because if they can tear down the image of Alex Jones or Iran, Paul or others
[57:12.980 --> 57:18.140]  who, again, aren't perfect, but are the ones that we know have good hearts and are moving
[57:18.140 --> 57:23.700]  in the right direction, then no one has any faith. No one believes we can have victory.
[57:23.700 --> 57:29.460]  No one believes we can have success. They want you to believe you've already been beaten.
[57:29.460 --> 57:33.700]  The globalists want to remain foggy and faceless. They don't want you to see them in the eyes
[57:33.700 --> 57:38.980]  for what they are. Humans just like us. I mean, who knows what's going to happen to
[57:38.980 --> 57:42.980]  me as things get more and more hardcore as we get bigger and bigger exponentially. We
[57:42.980 --> 57:48.500]  are exploding right now. And quite frankly, I'm not like, yay, for my individual self,
[57:48.500 --> 57:54.660]  I'm mourning that because I realize how dangerous it is. And I realize that if I don't sell
[57:54.660 --> 58:05.460]  out, they're going to hurt me, whether in the media and or individually or physically.
[58:05.460 --> 58:09.860]  But I'm not going to sell out. I'm going to continue to put the pedal of the medal for
[58:09.860 --> 58:15.460]  liberty. Besides, I've gone too far. I can't even sell out now. I mean, I'm committed to
[58:15.460 --> 58:19.420]  this. And I hope you're committed to it because where the road leads you, if we don't get
[58:19.420 --> 58:22.580]  off of it, it's going to be rough and it's going to be hard, but it's going to be a lot
[58:22.580 --> 58:26.460]  better than going down that road. And it's so many people that work for the government
[58:26.460 --> 58:31.580]  and work for these major corporations that have sold out. Man, you've sold out to something
[58:31.580 --> 58:36.540]  that is going to destroy you. I promise we're coming back in 60 seconds on directly to Tim,
[58:36.540 --> 58:40.900]  Rick, Julio, John, David and others. We're going to David first in the Ukraine.

[58:49.360 --> 58:54.820]  starts here. Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[58:54.820 --> 59:00.820]  It ended on June of 2009. The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree. Perhaps
[59:00.820 --> 59:04.900]  a recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things
[59:04.900 --> 59:09.380]  seem to be getting worse. Gold and silver haven't heard the news either. They've begun their
[59:09.380 --> 59:13.900]  long expected journey to the moon. In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into
[59:13.900 --> 59:18.420]  gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct. They both
[59:18.420 --> 59:23.620]  make fabulous investments. Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious
[59:23.620 --> 59:28.500]  than any financial resource. You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and
[59:28.500 --> 59:33.220]  you can't eat paper, stocks or metals. Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious
[59:33.220 --> 59:38.020]  easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term. This will freeze the cost to your food
[59:38.020 --> 59:45.500]  while you can still afford it. Visit eFoodsDirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633. That's

[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:31.860]  Okay, we're going to get into cameras and gas station bathrooms, making national news.
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:35.940]  China announcing they want to accelerate the demise of the dollar. That's already in full
[01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:46.780]  swing. World's poorest harvest AFP is reporting on. They're reporting on one poor harvest
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:51.380]  and we could have a collapse. We're going to get into explosive food prices, the biggest
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:57.700]  risk CNBC told you about that several years ago because of commodity prices going up.
[01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:02.340]  I want to get into what's happening in Tunisia. But right now, let's start going to your phone
[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:06.100]  calls. We do have a guest on the last 30 minutes of the next hour. We've got a lot of time
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:10.820]  to cover news and take your calls and a lot of audio and video I want to go to as well
[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:15.900]  today. Let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Michigan. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm going to go to Tim, but
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:21.900]  David in Ukraine. I want to go to David first in Ukraine. David, good to have you.
[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:27.060]  Thanks, Alex. It's a pleasure to be on your show and I want to say keep up the good work.
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:28.660]  You're doing a good job. We all appreciate it.
[01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:33.020]  Thank you. Are you an American living in the Ukraine or are you a Ukrainian?
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:41.020]  Yeah, I'm a first Gulf War veteran and I've been living overseas since above 94. So that's
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:46.580]  one of the reasons that I'm calling. I got a couple reasons. I watched a film on the
[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:52.100]  end of America.com or End America One. This is Porter Stansbury and he talks a bit about
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:56.220]  hyperinflation. I got a warning for Americans. Do you think you're going to have a food shortage
[01:01:56.220 --> 01:02:00.820]  just because of the crops failed? That's a big joke. When you see your currency devaluate
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:06.100]  50%, 100% overnight, you will not find anything in the stores. The stores will not be open.
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:13.420]  They won't sell what they have. And I got caught up in that November 1st, 1994. I saw
[01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:20.540]  hyperinflation the first time it was ever seen by the world in Ukraine. They defaulted
[01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:26.340]  and I went hungry for a week. If it wasn't for good people feeding, there was just nothing.
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:30.380]  The society fell apart and it took good two weeks to get back to...
[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:36.260]  Can you imagine if people will riot and stampede each other at Walmarts to get a 5% or 10%
[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:42.340]  discount on a computer game? What they'll do if there's not food and water for two weeks?
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:47.860]  They will riot and burn the cities to the ground and the police and military will be
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:53.940]  in the middle class areas taking our guns. That is their stated program during a crisis
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:58.300]  is to not bring food and water but to march in and take the guns. What do we see happen
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:02:59.300]  in New Orleans?
[01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:00.300]  Yeah, it's terrible.
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:07.180]  Well, for those that don't know, A, we're having a lot of big global crop failures because
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:13.300]  of all the strange weather. But the biggest issue, as you said, is dollar devaluation.
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:18.860]  You notice as oil goes up, as gold and silver goes up on the charts, they never tell the
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:23.460]  public why food and all these things are going up. The big driver, I'd say it's got
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:30.300]  to be 85% of it or more. Some analysts say as much as 95% is dollar devaluation and here's
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:36.060]  the Chinese leader talking about it. But still, they claim the shooter was bad because he
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:41.700]  was worried about currency problems. See, you're a murderer. You want to shoot children
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:44.380]  if you're concerned about the dollar.
[01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:52.700]  Yes, a terrible situation. I'm sitting overseas for the last 15 years and it just seems like
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:57.300]  every time I hear a story about what's going on in the United States, my heart just breaks
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:03.220]  because it's not the place that I remembered. I'm really worried about my friends and family
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:07.940]  back there because when the currency devaluates, a lot of people think it goes on. You're
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:13.860]  real nice and slow and you got time to prepare. It can go down overnight. You can lose the
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:18.140]  farm overnight and I've seen it happen and it's not a pretty sight.
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:22.300]  Well, don't worry. When they finally kill it in one big swoop, they're incrementally
[01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:26.300]  killing it now. The Bilderberg group stated four years ago they won an incremental. But
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:33.100]  even if you incrementally go down, let's hypothetically say on a graph of 10,000 points, since 1913 it's
[01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:40.060]  gone down about 90% or more. But that last 10, it accelerates and so if you're on a 10,000
[01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:45.820]  foot cliff and you walk down 9,000 feet, then you jump off the last 1,000, it's still going
[01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:54.860]  to kill you. And so, yeah, there will be downward spiral points in this and they'll blame it
[01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:59.340]  on some low level trader or somebody and get everybody a patsy to blame it on. We'll be
[01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:00.340]  right back.
[01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:06.460]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important
[01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:11.700]  day in America in more than 50 years. He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:15.540]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of
[01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:19.380]  your health and your own family. Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over
[01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:23.940]  the years. The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:28.700]  of GM, Danny May, Freddie Mac and America's biggest small owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:33.660]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently, he created a video which
[01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:37.740]  you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet
[01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:42.020]  and it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this
[01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:46.220]  free video online today. He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you

[01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:04.940]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:09.260]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number
[01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:13.900]  two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:19.500]  you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:23.980]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously
[01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:29.940]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four,
[01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:34.020]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose
[01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:38.780]  their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful
[01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:42.940]  backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:47.260]  offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information

[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:26.300]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I want to play this clip of Chris Matthews of Slimeball.
[01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:36.940]  He's on the same network as Mr. Maddow and it's amazing. He calls white people who don't
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:42.140]  want government-run healthcare crackers and that's the equivalent of calling a black
[01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:49.420]  person the N-word. But again, why is it only open season in this country on whitey? Well,
[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:55.460]  whitey's been taught this guilt and this self-hatred, not so that black people or anybody else
[01:08:55.460 --> 01:09:01.860]  can be uplifted, but that so whitey, the so-called majority, will get behind giving their guns
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:04.980]  up, giving their property up. Oh, you don't want government-run healthcare written by
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:09.820]  the insurance companies to rip you off? I'll call you a racist if you don't. Oh, you don't
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:14.060]  want to pass some gun control? I'll call you racist and the white people are like, no,
[01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:19.260]  no, I hate myself. I hate my culture. I hate my heritage. That's right. Every other culture
[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:25.100]  and heritage is good, but yours. You're bad. Say you're bad. I'm bad. I'm scum. And then
[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:32.060]  the race-baiting pimp lords, the fake eugenics liberals like Chris Matthews, they get to
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:40.980]  sit up there and go, listen, you white crackers, you don't like healthcare. You're racist. And
[01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:46.700]  that guy, Carlos Watson on there can call you racist and, oh, they don't like Obama,
[01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:52.140]  you know, getting tens of millions a day on vacation. It's because he's black. Oh, really,
[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:56.500]  they just rioted in Tunisia over the president taking too many big vacations and all the
[01:09:56.500 --> 01:10:00.900]  stuff his wife was buying. He's the exact same bloodline as the Tunisians. He's a North
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:06.940]  African Arab. Did they just riot because he's, because he's an Arab? This is ridiculous.
[01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:11.740]  Oh, I don't like the communist Chinese one-child policy. Oh, you don't like Asians. Actually,
[01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:16.940]  I'm saying they shouldn't kill Asians. Shut up, racist. I don't like Margaret Singer.
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:22.340]  She's into eugenics. She said we have to pose as liberals to fool the blacks so we can abort
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:27.140]  them. Shut up, racist. Actually, I don't want to kill the black people. Shut up, Nazi. I'm
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:32.780]  a liberal. I'm Chris Matthews. I'm Mr. Maddow. They're the great high priest up there and
[01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:37.340]  they tell us you do what we say. You're a racist. They're not liberals. They're not conservatives.
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:45.700]  They're corporate general electric owned bomb makers. They are systematic sellers of 21st
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:53.300]  century New World Order eugenics, Nazism. Do you think the devil comes masquerading
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:11:01.020]  as a guy in red pajamas looking like Anton LeVe? The devil comes as an angel of light
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:11.900]  and the eugenics Nazi comes as a Mr. Maddow, as a Mr. Slimeball, as a Mr. Lyerman. Don't
[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:20.140]  you understand that? That's what they don't. So of course they're now resorting to crackers.
[01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:25.660]  They want black viewers to hate white people and they know full well in their psych warfare
[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:30.220]  operations that whites are going to see that become more racially hateful and then they
[01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:35.420]  can sit up there as the referee, the big city poverty pimps going back over 150 years, you
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:40.260]  know, in Boston and Chicago and New York and other mega cities, you know, they put people
[01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:45.820]  in racial divides and then would have local mob bosses who were racially controlling who
[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:50.180]  would then meet with each other and decide how to manipulate their own groups through
[01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:54.460]  race, because then they put up with corruption as long as it was somebody in their race doing
[01:11:54.460 --> 01:12:02.260]  it to them. And that's what Obama is. So if you don't call yourself a cracker, then you're
[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:09.460]  bad. Call yourselves crackers. Say you're bad. Pay your indulgence to Al Gore, kind of like
[01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:14.300]  people 500, 600 years ago would have to pay money to the Pope to get their family out
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:19.540]  of purgatory. Let's all let's all give everything. Okay, I said I'd cover that the bottom of
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:22.740]  the hour and I'm already running. I'll cover it at 45 after I want to get to your calls.
[01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:27.300]  I apologize. We'll take a lot of them now. Tim and Michigan, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:35.060]  Yeah, Alex, you can call me cracker Jones. Yes. Hey, cracker Jones, man. Yeah, Tim, I'm
[01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:39.780]  not gonna, I'm not gonna, I'm gonna get strictly into information today. First thing about
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:45.100]  China. There's a real simple reason why China doesn't want to get in any major conflicts
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:51.340]  with the United States. Number one is they have a main folder of U. S. U. S. currency
[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:59.540]  in the entire world. Yeah, correct me if I'm wrong, but we also are indebted to them
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:05.020]  higher than any other country. No, our government's only going to advertise them as a military
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:10.860]  threat to get more corporate military welfare. China is being given the roads, the ports,
[01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:15.980]  the infrastructure. So are the Arabs. So are the European Israeli companies. I mean, we
[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:21.660]  it's a complete fire sale and China is being given all of our missile secrets, jet fighter
[01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:27.540]  secrets, AWACS secrets. China is going to be the new model and we're being phased down,
[01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:31.740]  but China only controls our debt teamed up with the private fellow reserve who they signed
[01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:37.500]  agreements with when our government put Mao in in 49. This is all on record now declassified.
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:41.420]  And so it's even on history channel. They even admit it that they, you know, sabotage
[01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:46.420]  Shanghai, check what, what the far right said in this country was true. Shanghai, check Americans
[01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:50.460]  would, would, you know, citizen groups would pay to give them armaments, pay to get boat
[01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:55.340]  loads of guns. Then, and then the CIA would take the bolts out of the guns and say, here
[01:13:55.340 --> 01:14:00.380]  you go, Shanghai, check, you go ahead and run to Taiwan and Mao was given the power
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:05.020]  because our government was secretly funding communism. Well, they'd openly funded Uncle
[01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:12.140]  Joe Stalin. And so China made that deal. They publicly let everybody know that in the 1970s
[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:17.940]  and, you know, that China was our new buddy. So, so, so China is to slowly absorb the United
[01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:22.780]  States drive down wages, make sure nobody can compete with them. That gives the globalist
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:28.340]  the mercantile through the modern 21st century mercantile model, the system to muscle out
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:33.420]  any competition. Once things are vertically integrated, then the police state fully comes
[01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:38.100]  into play. Then we go into a police state mode. And then the bankers are going to use
[01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:44.140]  the US and China as their offshore as two Titans that they play off against each other.
[01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:47.940]  And when one gets too powerful, they'll stick this Titan on the other Titan. When the other
[01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:53.580]  gets too powerful, they'll stick them in. And so it's all a big management system. You
[01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:59.660]  understand? Yeah, I do. I got another question for you. I'm kind of on a, I don't know, a
[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:04.740]  crusade here about the, about fluoride. You know, I know you want to kind of talk about,
[01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:09.140]  you know, more current stuff. But to me, as long as they're still putting it in my water,
[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:14.580]  it's still, it's still mainstream news to me. I found two websites. I'm going to give
[01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:21.060]  you the websites real quick. And I'm going to, I made up my own flyer and also downloaded
[01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:25.660]  yours. But that city I actually live in, I say I'm from Detroit, but everybody that
[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:30.260]  lives in Michigan says, yeah, I'm from Detroit. So in a manner of speaking. But anyway, I
[01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:35.380]  called up, this is a flyer actually says, I called the Mount Clemens water tech and
[01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:40.380]  he has informed me that they add sodium fluoride to our tap water. Two space tells us this
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:45.580]  crap is poison. And if your child eats it, you're the call poison control. This junk
[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:50.820]  is toxic, but they want us to drink it. Why? Call them and ask. And I put the phone number
[01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:55.100]  on there. And at the bottom, I wrote, do you love your kids and your family? And I got
[01:15:55.100 --> 01:16:00.060]  that picture that you had up with a bag of sodium fluoride that says toxic. And it's
[01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:04.340]  got a few things that it attacks, not from nervous system bones, gastronomical system
[01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:10.460]  teeth, you know, all that stuff. Anyway, there's a few websites. I found this woman, her name
[01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:16.860]  is Shelly Kramer. She, she did an extensive, it's a six, it came out to be a six page.
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:22.300]  No, listen, listen, go ahead and give the websites out because I gotta move on. I mean,
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:29.620]  we have medical doctors, endocrinologist, brain surgeons, former top toxicologist from
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:34.420]  the government. I mean, that's who we have on with what we give to people because that
[01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:39.340]  totally blows city councils away. I know there's a lot of folks that have compiled big list
[01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:42.700]  of this, but I've got to move to other callers, give the websites out quickly.
[01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:49.260]  Okay, here, here we go. The title of it is controversy about sodium fluoride is used
[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:54.780]  as rat poison. And the website is healthy slash communications.com.
[01:16:54.780 --> 01:17:00.980]  Good, I got to go. I appreciate your call. A caller called in and he said, I know you're
[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:05.260]  covering other issues, but I want to cover fluoride that isn't getting covered. I spent
[01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:11.660]  probably 30 minutes of the two hour show yesterday off and on with fluoride. And we produced
[01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:16.780]  a video that is full of documents and links and medical doctors and the government now
[01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:23.300]  having to admit fluorides hurting people. This is big breaking news and you never know
[01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:27.540]  what viewers are going to watch. I mean, I can do a video about, you know, something
[01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:33.220]  that I think isn't, you know, as important as other issues and it'll get a million views.
[01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:37.340]  And then we put together a highly produced, very powerful video. And last time I checked,
[01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:41.980]  it's only had like 25,000 views. It's been up for two and a half days. And the headline
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:48.580]  is bombshell how fluoride is killing you and your children. Email it to everyone you know.
[01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:56.620]  It's up on prisonplanet.com with an article full of links to medical doctors backing up
[01:17:56.620 --> 01:18:02.460]  everything I'm saying, the other poisons that are in water, not just the fluoride. Get it.
[01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:06.740]  Get it out to everybody you know. It's on prisonplanet.com or just type it into the search
[01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:15.060]  engine. Bombshell how fluoride is killing you and your children. 10 minute video with
[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:21.340]  an in-depth bibliography. It's like a video book. I mean, everything in it is links and
[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:26.420]  documents and it's all right there and people have short attention spans. This will wake
[01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:34.140]  them up. Bombshell how fluoride is killing you and your children. And this is something
[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:38.780]  that we can do something about. This is something where we can start removing out of our water,
[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:44.140]  put a filter on our showers or a bathtub. That's where you absorb a lot of it. We know
[01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:49.820]  what it's doing. And now the government, because of pushback, has had to admit some of the
[01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:54.740]  health dangers. This is a big deal. So your family who's been in denial will now learn
[01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:58.580]  about fluoride, but the hundreds of other chemicals they're putting in, if you'll send
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:04.140]  them this free video. We're not even selling anything on the video. Most of what we do
[01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:07.940]  doesn't have an ad attached to it, though it probably should. I mean, how do you think
[01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:12.940]  we fund this operation, the news websites, the filmmaking, the TV studio that's almost
[01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:17.540]  done, the radio slash TV studio we're in right now. We fund it through the products
[01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:25.900]  we promote. And the products that I promote are what I believe in. I mean, I believe that

[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:34.740]  we're promoting info wars team.com. I believe that's a good product. I believe that gold
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:39.700]  and silver were a good buy. Has it been in the last 10 years? I believe my films are
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:43.620]  well done and informative. When you purchase them at info wars.com and the online video

[01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:20.340]  lawsuits. When I first joined, I was being sued. So I used the program methods and after

[01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:22.980]  I hurt myself today to see if I still feel
[01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:29.980]  the pain. I focus on the pain. The only thing that's real. The needle tears the hole.
[01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:40.620]  We've got Glenn Spencer joining us at the start of the next hour from the front lines
[01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:46.260]  of the Arizona border to give you a real report, and he's the guy who advises Congress
[01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:50.780]  on what's happening down there, because remember the telescreens are going in to report on
[01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:57.780]  you and your family. The spy grids are being activated, the citizen spy squads. Kurt Nemo
[01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:05.300]  has got an article at infowars.com today about the FBI openly federalizing the police and
[01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:13.140]  setting up all sorts of anti-terror operations in Portland, Oregon, just like they federalized
[01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:19.100]  Dallas in New York and Boston and Chicago and Miami. It's all unconstitutional. The
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:25.380]  threat fusion centers, so they're clamping down on the general public and surveilling
[01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:29.460]  us, but then leaving the borders wide open is my point. It shows how transparent all
[01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:35.700]  of this is and how fraudulent it is, but then we have Tarpley in the last 30 minutes on
[01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:42.140]  the Tunisian situation. Tunisian forces fight presidential guards near the palace. Sometimes
[01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:48.640]  I disagree with Tarpley's political answers, but I rarely disagree with his political analysis.
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:55.640]  You understand the difference? He's spot on, speaking five languages, doctorate in history,
[01:25:56.260 --> 01:26:03.260]  degree in economics, really has a deep knowledge of history and the forces that are out there.
[01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:11.220]  I just disagree sometimes with Tarpley's solutions, but I don't know anyone as informed and educated
[01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:15.900]  and who has a deep grasp of how things really worked in Tarpley. And so maybe I'm wrong.
[01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:22.900]  You know, maybe socialism is the way. Of course, he'll argue and say, Alex, I do not like socialism.
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:31.940]  This is the American way what I like. The American system. Roosevelt, Roosevelt. Of course, I'm
[01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:36.700]  joking. Socialism is not the way it always produces tyranny and bondage, and the bankers
[01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:41.620]  that Tarpley exposes so much are always financing it. But I don't want to get off into a rant
[01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:45.700]  about Tarpley. I'm out of control today. This is a short segment, too, but I'm going to
[01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:49.900]  get to at least this bank of callers. Let's talk to Rick in Florida. You're on the air.
[01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:55.580]  Go ahead. He just dropped off. Perfect timing, Rick. Hulio in Illinois. You're on the air.
[01:26:55.580 --> 01:27:00.260]  Alex, apologies. I'm kind of mumbled this morning because I'm getting sick from all
[01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:04.500]  these chemtrails. But before I get to what Lindsay Williams spoke of yesterday, if I
[01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:10.500]  could ask you for a huge favor at any of the info warriors who are listening, a simple
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:17.500]  thing, but it's going to expose the soon-to-be mafia boss of Chicago, Rom Sugar Daddy Emanuel,
[01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:22.620]  myself, Gary Franchi, and Wayne Manson teamed together for an investigative report. If you
[01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:29.540]  could Google this, expose Rom Emanuel. I mean, this gets into how shady Rom Emanuel is.
[01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:36.980]  Here's a secretive past. Everything. Expose Rom Emanuel. It's going to take you to a YouTube
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:42.980]  clip off of the Google search. If you info warriors could do that, Gary Franchi and I
[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:46.860]  would work. Sure. I want to do that, Hulio. It's just that some days I don't even take
[01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:51.140]  calls anymore because we don't screen calls and it just turns into a wall-to-wall plug
[01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:56.340]  fest. You know, the last guy's got this to plug. You've got that to plug. And I enjoy
[01:27:56.340 --> 01:28:00.540]  taking calls, but they could become a thing of the past just because the listeners tell
[01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:05.820]  us they want to hear a guest. They want to actually hear me. I like hearing from you.
[01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:11.140]  But I think we actually link to that video. It's up on the Alex Jones channel where they
[01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:16.780]  break down what a crook Rom Emanuel is. But if the people of Chicago don't know that,
[01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:20.740]  they're getting what they deserve. But then there's the bigger issue, Hulio, of how much
[01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:26.900]  fraud there is involved in Chicago. I mean, maybe you don't even have voting there. I
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:31.300]  mean, there is some evidence of even the Kennedy election being fixed out of Chicago, isn't
[01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:32.300]  there?
[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:36.580]  Oh, yeah. I mean, that's mainline history right there, stuffing the ballot box in the
[01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:40.820]  Chicago River. But off of that, again, if people could book that up, there'd be great
[01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:41.820]  answers to the question.
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:42.820]  Yeah, I understand.
[01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:48.780]  But quickly, what Lindsay Williams said yesterday, I mean, he's always right. Silver, I've been
[01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:53.620]  looking at the price right now. It's continuing to go down due to the market manipulation.
[01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:59.740]  But my question for you, Alex, in terms of what Lindsay said is, you know, with the way
[01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:04.180]  silver's going, can we do more of how they're manipulating the silver market? I know you've
[01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:09.780]  done specials with Max Kaiser in the past, but I don't think people really know how deep
[01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:13.660]  the silver manipulation is going. And then also, no one's talking about what's happening
[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:20.540]  in Arizona, who this Lochner guy's lawyer is. She represented CIA nut jobs in the past
[01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:25.940]  like the Unabomber, Timothy McVeigh, and someone who was with Al-Qaeda, whose name I'm talking
[01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:26.940]  about.
[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:31.260]  You see these lawyers that have represented mind control victims in the past, and it's
[01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:36.460]  in the LA Times. Alexander Cockburn had an article on it. It was declassified that Kaczynski
[01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:41.900]  was in MKUltra program. He's in the mind control program, but then we don't understand this
[01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:47.060]  was a staged event. And this Lochner thing, it's got all the telltale signs. I agree with
[01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:51.540]  you, Julio. Great points. We're going to be right back with more calls.
[01:29:51.540 --> 01:30:02.740]  Here on the March, the Empire's on the Run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:07.260]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:09.620]  chance to not relive history.
[01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:13.980]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:14.980]  at home.
[01:30:14.980 --> 01:30:19.980]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling
[01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:20.980]  the shots.
[01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:25.980]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:31.420]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel
[01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:36.100]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:40.460]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches. And the Congress
[01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:42.460]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:48.460]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:49.860]  of the Republic.
[01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:55.940]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right

[01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:21.660]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is, he's usually
[01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:26.060]  right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's
[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:31.740]  biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties. In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:35.820]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest
[01:32:35.820 --> 01:32:40.500]  and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this enough.
[01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:44.340]  You should at least watch this free video online today. He explains everything you need to
[01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:48.180]  know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself. You can find the video

[01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:17.140]  Okay, let's go back to your calls here, trying to get to all of them that I can ahead of
[01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:21.260]  two guests coming up. Let's talk to John in Ohio. John, you're on the year.
[01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:26.780]  Hey, Alex. Well, I guess the whole rest of the nation is evidenced by Chris Matthews
[01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:31.460]  are going to get the same treatment that people from Kentucky, West Virginia, and Mississippi
[01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:36.900]  have been getting now for the past 60 years, because for whatever reason in Hollywood, if
[01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:42.220]  you notice the way they portray in movies, you'd have days to confuse, which was done
[01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:46.540]  in Texas, which was portrayed pretty even handily. You transfer that movie to Eastern
[01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:51.500]  Kentucky, where my family was from, it would have been down, stupid, everything else. So
[01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:55.460]  they've been bashing everybody like this for a long time, but they're now expanding
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:59.420]  the bashing program, if you know what I mean. Oh, that's right. You know, everybody who
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:05.460]  lives in the South is married to their sister and has no teeth and is scum. And anybody
[01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:11.980]  that owns a gun hates black people. And then I see black folks on TV going, yeah, these
[01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:16.940]  racist whites want their guns. Don't those poor black folks know the first gun laws were
[01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:23.260]  disarming black people after slavery ended, because folks in the North and the South said,
[01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:27.380]  we're not going to have these black people owning guns so they can protect themselves.
[01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:35.740]  I mean, it's so sick to watch the poverty pimps that sell race and all of this division
[01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:41.820]  and they sell feminism admittedly CIA funded Miss magazine to break up the families. So
[01:34:41.820 --> 01:34:46.420]  we're all isolated. So the state can come in and control our lives and to watch them
[01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:52.040]  up on their high horse and to watch him say, you're a cracker. That's the equivalent of
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:57.380]  N word to black people. You're a cracker and it's a white guy saying, and it's supposedly
[01:34:57.380 --> 01:35:04.500]  cute and funny. They want race war. They want racial division. They want to be the referee.
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:15.700]  They lied and said that the shooter out in Arizona was a white guy was a white supremacist.
[01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:21.100]  Though that turned out to be false. He was a guy drugged out of his mind. If he was anything,
[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:26.200]  he was a mainline liberal. And now more and more is coming out on that front. These people
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:31.300]  are a pack of liars, but here's the goodness. 10 years ago, that hoax, they ran would have
[01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:36.260]  worked within days. The hoax was exposed and now you notice they've dropped it. And now
[01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:40.660]  it's all about mental health. Oh, we need to get everybody screened in America to see
[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:45.020]  if you're mentally ill. Then they want to give you drugs that on record make you go
[01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:50.300]  psychotic, make a certain percentage become violent. Then we'll have an even bigger epidemic
[01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:56.740]  of this type of stuff happening. And another thing I wanted to tell you was I believe instead
[01:35:56.740 --> 01:36:01.260]  of the scenario, we are headed towards another scenario. I call the perfect storm. I believe
[01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:07.700]  that 2012 is a real thing, only in the sense of this. I think there is going to be destruction,
[01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:11.860]  but the question is I believe it's going to be government made destruction. I think there's
[01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:16.220]  a guy named George Green who was on a project Camelot. I don't know if he's true or not,
[01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:21.500]  but he has said something about there is a group that is planning a destruction of the
[01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:26.340]  United States in a couple areas using neutron weapons and stuff like that. And this is the
[01:36:26.340 --> 01:36:30.620]  reason why they've built the Denver airport in the other places. The Bushes are moving
[01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:36.340]  to Paraguay and a bunch of other things is going on right now. And I think with 2012-2013,
[01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:41.420]  we're going to see the slave system, the full destruction come in in the next two years,
[01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:47.660]  two, three, four years. Well, actually Bertrand Russell, Nobel Prize winner and many others
[01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:54.740]  have openly discussed using neutron bombs on the people of the world. They said they'd
[01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:59.780]  have to have a global government first to then carry it out a coordinated neutron bomb
[01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:07.020]  attack simultaneously through the United Nations of all the major capitals, Tokyo, Moscow,
[01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:13.220]  London, Paris, New York, DC, all the major city centers to reduce the world population
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:20.380]  for the earth. And it only kills the life forms in the cities and then allow the rewilding
[01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:26.100]  of that because humanity is, quote, a cancer. And so I have seen a lot of discussions. Cheney
[01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:30.900]  wrote in the PNAC documents, September 20, 2000, rebuilding America's defenses about
[01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:36.980]  the use of race specific bio weapons. He said, no, we need to get the media to condition
[01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:42.100]  the public that race weapons are good. And so yes, they have all these weapons and they
[01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:49.700]  are openly discussing it. I appreciate your call, John, a really good point on that front.
[01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:55.220]  I'm going to get into the cracker comment in a moment if you think I'm joking. See,
[01:37:55.220 --> 01:38:00.460]  they hype up racism and they don't like black people all day. That's meant to get us at
[01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:06.220]  each other's throats. And if that won't work, then it'll be mobilize the quote minorities
[01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:12.660]  who are really the majority now in this country together against cracker, but not the cracker
[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:20.220]  up there race pimping, Chris Matthews. He's a master cracker. He's a controller cracker.
[01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:24.820]  So, so all of us that don't want to be under government run healthcare and the death panels
[01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:31.180]  that are now admitted, first they denied it. We're dirty crackers. And see, then that
[01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:34.980]  kind of rekindles. Well, it's all right to be racist against a cracker. That's why I've
[01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:40.980]  got to see the names of Hispanic radio and TV stations called the infasora, the Raza,
[01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:47.620]  which means the race, the reconquista, the reconquering, show the invasion, the reconquering,
[01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:53.820]  the race. La Raza has giant functions with hundreds of thousands of people meeting, you
[01:38:53.820 --> 01:39:00.540]  know, daily, yearly events on a single day across the country. And I've seen the tapes
[01:39:00.540 --> 01:39:05.140]  of it and played it with mayors and Congress people saying whites are evil. Soon they'll
[01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:14.060]  be dealt with and just huge crowds of people. Raza, Raza, and it's like, but then Matthews
[01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:20.220]  like shut up crackers. See, all of that is okay. See, so they're openly saying it's okay
[01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:24.900]  to hate white people. They're the devil. They're the bad men. And that's only because the globalists
[01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:29.420]  are going to try to get us all fighting with each other as we go into this depression.
[01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:34.380]  And the globalists always use quote outsiders or people that are seen as outsiders because
[01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:39.100]  then they will come in and be oppressors. I've had members of parliament on from England
[01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:44.220]  who will admit that about half their CPS or foreigners who can't even speak English because
[01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:48.460]  they come from authoritarian countries, mainly white Eastern Europeans, not bashing white
[01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:52.340]  Eastern Europeans. It's just they're finding white Eastern Europeans who like to steal
[01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:57.860]  kids who like to oppress, who grew up in that, who like the authority, who like the uniforms.
[01:39:57.860 --> 01:40:04.460]  And so they're unleashing hell upon everybody. But I mean, it's incredible. I could have
[01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:08.820]  one Spencer that maybe call Spencer and see if he's not on the road, have him hook up
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:14.220]  his computer clips so we can hear the mayor of LA and all them talk about go home pilgrims
[01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:19.500]  and we're going to get you and your last gasp of white people and whites are the devil.
[01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:26.420]  I've got a tape of the old Gus Garcia mayor in Austin openly saying that that Hispanics
[01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:34.300]  are a superior God race, part alien. You think I'm joking. They had a city proclamation
[01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:39.420]  of the supreme cosmic race of Hispanics. And again, I don't care if you're black, white,
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:44.860]  Hispanic, whatever, but don't sit there on a high horse spewing racism, spewing. We're
[01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:49.660]  going to get the white pilgrim cracker and then tell me, oh, you don't like that. Well,
[01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:55.300]  you're just a cracker. Get in the ditch and die. When it's all master crackers like Chris
[01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:58.740]  Matthews. See, I'm already covering this. I'm going to get to it coming up. Let's talk
[01:40:58.740 --> 01:41:02.860]  to fast pace. California, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:10.940]  Fast for peace. Yeah, fast for peace. That's a solution. Fasting will detox us and return
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:17.900]  health, immortality and mental health from the top down. But well, first you have to
[01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:24.220]  know that the economy operates under Parkinson's law, which is the most tax for the most jobs.
[01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:32.340]  And that's the only reason all this is happening and creating enmity, divide, conquer. And it's
[01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:37.780]  working exactly like it's worked from day one. The constitution was there to protect
[01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:45.220]  free enterprise and not freedom. And under free enterprise, any guy or any few can walk
[01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:50.780]  away with all the loot. So nothing is different than it's ever been if you're into government.
[01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:55.420]  Government means the money changing economy. That's all it is. Yeah, but our government
[01:41:55.420 --> 01:42:00.300]  was set up to not have the money changing and it certainly isn't perfect. But the big
[01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:06.660]  corrupt British Empire tried to stop it. And the model that this government was set up on,
[01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:13.700]  the globalists have done everything they can fast for peace to pull that down. And you
[01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:20.540]  talk about free market, this isn't a free market we have. This is an insider trading
[01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:21.540]  crony system.
[01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:28.060]  But all the governments of the world didn't just get there by accident. They were all
[01:42:28.060 --> 01:42:35.500]  set up to fight with each other to create enmity and divide the spoils. There's 500
[01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:41.780]  plus border wars going on at all times. Nature wars. We're losing the sun. We need the sun
[01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:45.820]  fast to bring back the sun. They're trying to deflect it, but they're acting.
[01:42:45.820 --> 01:42:50.420]  All right, well, listen, I appreciate your call. It's good to hear from you, man. Scott
[01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:52.780]  in Illinois, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:42:52.780 --> 01:43:00.500]  Hi, Alex. Hey, buddy. Oh, I'm sorry. I must have skipped out. Love you. Love your show.
[01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:05.740]  Thank you so much for doing all you do. I pray to the Lord that I get on today to get
[01:43:05.740 --> 01:43:10.700]  this message out. And I actually heard it from the Vulcan. And he said, the only way
[01:43:10.700 --> 01:43:16.140]  to cure all this, Alex, is to starve the bankers. What do you think about that?
[01:43:16.140 --> 01:43:19.740]  When you say the Vulcan, you talking about some internet handle or something?
[01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:26.340]  Yeah. Yeah. Well, you do need to starve the bankers. The problem is the bankers can create
[01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:33.540]  all of the energy credits or money, symbols of energy that we will then give up our energy,
[01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:40.900]  our labor, our products, our handiwork, our art, our bodies for these symbols that are
[01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:46.300]  made out of nothing. So the bankers through their greatest Ponzi scheme in history get
[01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:51.700]  the whole world for nothing. As Thomas Jefferson said, if you ever allow private banks to
[01:43:51.700 --> 01:43:56.860]  issue currency and credit, we will, our grandchildren will wake up homeless on the continent. Their
[01:43:56.860 --> 01:44:01.740]  forefathers conquered. And so it's, it's, you know, people say, take your money out
[01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:08.900]  of the banks or don't pay taxes. The bankers only have you pay taxes to slow down the economy,
[01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:19.420]  to control it, to redistribute money, to give some value to their fiat system. So non-compliance
[01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:23.980]  is good just because of the act of saying no and getting outside the system and growing
[01:44:23.980 --> 01:44:29.380]  an alternative black market economy is what they would call it. People say, well, you
[01:44:29.380 --> 01:44:34.340]  know, Alex, why do you still pay income taxes? I mean, I openly explain that because I choose
[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:42.300]  my battles. I've watched all these very brave, conscious, well-meaning people go to prison
[01:44:42.300 --> 01:44:46.900]  when they stop paying the taxes. Now I've seen some people win in court and we're seeing
[01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:52.260]  a reformation, a wake up along that. So I have guessed on exposing that the income taxes
[01:44:52.260 --> 01:44:58.380]  of fraud set up in 1913, that most Americans didn't have to pay the tax till the fifties,
[01:44:58.380 --> 01:45:01.860]  that it's been phased in, that it doesn't fund the government and that we should get
[01:45:01.860 --> 01:45:06.940]  rid of it. But that doesn't mean get a value added tax as the replacement or on top of
[01:45:06.940 --> 01:45:12.540]  it as a lot of well-meaning conservatives have been conned to start promoting. So there's
[01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:18.900]  that going on. And so I have to choose my battles and, you know, try to not fall into
[01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:24.460]  their pits. I mean, if I wanted to choose the income tax situation as the place to stand,
[01:45:24.460 --> 01:45:29.660]  I could get the lawyers, get ready, prepare to be arrested, go through the court hearings
[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:36.740]  for years, like a Joe Bannister or a Crier and maybe win. But I'm having them on instead
[01:45:36.740 --> 01:45:41.500]  showing what heroes they are. See, we're all choosing battles. My mission is to get the
[01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:52.700]  word out about the corruption and to cross every T dot every I to try to again operate
[01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:58.540]  completely within the system so that I could be inside the matrix and destroy it. Does
[01:45:58.540 --> 01:46:03.740]  that make sense? It makes perfect sense, Alex. What about like a Google bomb? We have like
[01:46:03.740 --> 01:46:11.220]  a bank bomb. So one day we just stop all activity, bomb them, show them how powerful we are,
[01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:15.100]  Alex. Well, you know, we've tried to do the silver situation. If you look at a 10-year
[01:46:15.100 --> 01:46:19.420]  or even five-year or one-year silver graph, it's going straight up. And it was like 20
[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:23.220]  bucks an ounce, you know, just four or five months ago. Now it's been up between 28 and
[01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:27.020]  30. And the bankers are trying to manipulate it down. It ran back up last week. They manipulated
[01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:31.420]  it back down. But if you look at the long-term graph, we're winning that fight all-time physical
[01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:36.500]  purchasing of silver. Bloomberg reported has been at all-time highs the last two weeks.
[01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:41.940]  So silver in the real world is selling for well above $30 an ounce, even though it's
[01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:46.900]  $28 an ounce in, you know, in spot or I'm not sure what it is today. But you guys look
[01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:52.980]  up spot silver for me. Thank you. So more and more, we're revealing the fraud of the
[01:46:52.980 --> 01:47:04.020]  paper market versus the real market. And I mean, what's your idea, Scott, for a bank
[01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:09.260]  bomb? And of course, they'll take that out of context. You mean a peaceful info war
[01:47:09.260 --> 01:47:15.540]  bank bomb? I mean, what do we do? Pull all our money out of the banks? On what date or
[01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:21.100]  I mean, what do you think that's going to do? Nothing like that, Alex. A peaceful demonstration
[01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:27.700]  of the people of the masses. And we do it one day at a time. And we all choose not to
[01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:32.540]  use our credit card. We all choose not to fill up gas on one day. We all choose not
[01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:39.220]  to drink Coca Cola one day. We all choose one thing. You're talking about a national
[01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:46.620]  or global strike? No, an info war strike. No, I agree with you. No, no, that's good.
[01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:51.700]  I think we should have a global strike. We've had guest on about, you know, every 15th having
[01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:59.300]  a strike. And what the French do of having their farmers block highways, that's one
[01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:04.220]  of the most effective things here. The police will actually beat you and Taser you as an
[01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:09.060]  attempt to not let citizens, you know, demonstrate. But I think more, you're going to see more
[01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:13.540]  and more of that good idea. We should all debate it and discuss it and look for a date.
[01:48:13.540 --> 01:48:20.260]  I mean, I think national strike every year on April 15th. That's coming up. I think
[01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:26.460]  every 15th have a strike. But I mean, that's up to the listeners to take action with. I
[01:48:26.460 --> 01:48:29.820]  mean, I wouldn't do a Google bomb on that today because we need to write articles about
[01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:37.140]  it, codify the idea. I said last week I want to have a contest for $10,000, $7,000 first
[01:48:37.140 --> 01:48:45.740]  place, 2,000 second place, 1,000 third place for videos countering the TSA asking citizens
[01:48:45.740 --> 01:48:51.300]  to make videos for Homeland Security to err on the 9,000 telescreens telling you how dangerous
[01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:55.820]  the internet is. See, they know the power of the citizens. So they want to get you serving
[01:48:55.820 --> 01:49:00.380]  their evil. We've had a lot of contest exposing the banksters, but I've got to get around
[01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:05.780]  to writing up the rules, how we want it to work, getting it up on the site. But I'll
[01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:10.660]  try to get that done today and get that going. And yeah, the idea of a national strike every
[01:49:10.660 --> 01:49:15.940]  April 15th, I think is a great one. So I mean, let's call for it now. But we need to get
[01:49:15.940 --> 01:49:20.860]  the articles together, the plan, the reasons, why we're doing it. I mean, I mean, really,
[01:49:20.860 --> 01:49:25.540]  I just can't organize and deploy all of it. But I do appreciate your call. It's a great
[01:49:25.540 --> 01:49:30.540]  idea, Scott. Let's talk to Brad and Michigan and Scott, Pamela and Jeff. Go ahead, Brad,
[01:49:30.540 --> 01:49:31.540]  you're on the year.
[01:49:31.540 --> 01:49:39.780]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call. I am trying to wake people up and really, I use
[01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:46.700]  9-11 to expose a lot of this. With all the evidence we have at 9-11, why can't we get
[01:49:46.700 --> 01:49:49.740]  a new investigation? What is really stopping that?
[01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:52.100]  Well, they tried to have one. Go ahead.
[01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:58.020]  And if we can't get a real investigation, how come we can't with the nano evidence and
[01:49:58.020 --> 01:50:03.500]  all of that? Why can't we at least file formal indictments, at least against a security company
[01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:08.020]  and force them to talk under court order or something? I mean, what's really stopping
[01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:09.020]  this process?
[01:50:09.020 --> 01:50:16.220]  Well, if you want to go after Marvin Bush that ran security, that is a plan politically.
[01:50:16.220 --> 01:50:23.220]  You could try to do a four-year request or you get them into a lawsuit and then have
[01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:29.420]  the interrogatories. You could depose them. That takes a lot of money and a lot of will
[01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:36.420]  to sue the mafia. 9-11 Truth in New York, who I've supported, we are changing others,
[01:50:36.420 --> 01:50:41.740]  has tried and gotten the signatures for a city investigation and the judge throughout
[01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:47.300]  the signatures, even though they had 10,000 plus extra. But we're winning in the court
[01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:50.700]  of public opinion. We're airing the Building What campaign ads that our listeners have
[01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:55.900]  contributed to. And we've won the court of public opinion worldwide. So now they can't
[01:50:55.900 --> 01:51:00.700]  just stage these events and then get away with it. People know who's behind it now.
[01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:05.420]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:10.260]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:14.060]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have
[01:51:14.060 --> 01:51:17.540]  all performed even gold and silver before in this country. And it's possible that could
[01:51:17.540 --> 01:51:22.100]  even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect
[01:51:22.100 --> 01:51:28.300]  mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank. And it can produce an endless supply
[01:51:28.300 --> 01:51:32.860]  of nutrient dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have
[01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:36.980]  not been genetically modified in any way. And you actually get enough seeds to plant
[01:51:36.980 --> 01:51:44.420]  a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:44.420 --> 01:51:55.620]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:51:55.620 --> 01:52:01.060]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:05.100]  One of the most potent ways to lower blood pressure is to inhibit the angiotensin converting
[01:53:05.100 --> 01:53:10.100]  enzyme in the body, also called ACE. In nature, there are a group of proteins found in unheated
[01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:15.620]  way that inhibit the ACE enzyme. The most potent ACE inhibitor to date is lactokinin.
[01:53:15.620 --> 01:53:20.260]  While lactokinin does not have the inhibitory potency of synthetic drugs commonly used in
[01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:24.820]  the treatment of hypertension, this naturally occurring whey peptide may be able to help
[01:53:24.820 --> 01:53:29.700]  keep blood pressure normal. The most powerful whey protein supplement on the market is One
[01:53:29.700 --> 01:53:35.380]  World Whey. One World Whey is the first ever unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed
[01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:40.820]  cows. One World Whey is easily digested and tastes delicious. Use One World Whey to support
[01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:46.420]  your exercise or weight loss goals, your optimal blood pressure, energy, endurance, and mood.

[01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:05.620]  It's almost like whatever he does is no good. Let's kill it because it's his. Here's
[01:54:05.620 --> 01:54:09.860]  House Majority Leader Eric Cader, spokesperson, talking today, quoted, it's important for
[01:54:09.860 --> 01:54:15.820]  Congress to get back to work. To that end, we will resume thoughtful consideration of
[01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:22.500]  the healthcare bill next week. Sam, it seems to me that it is a big question. So much of
[01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:27.100]  this attack on Obama has been at hominem, directed at the person, the president. Whether
[01:54:27.100 --> 01:54:31.500]  it's somebody, some cracker out there on the right calling him, some birth third type who
[01:54:31.500 --> 01:54:35.420]  says he's not an American, or it's somebody a little more sophisticated, but basically
[01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:40.180]  saying he's a socialist. Will there be on the merits of the bill? Will they stay off
[01:54:40.180 --> 01:54:47.460]  it? There you go. You are a cracker, meaning you're a bad white person. It's bad to be
[01:54:47.460 --> 01:54:53.300]  white. It's bad to be European. Whether you're Romanian or Italian or Austrian or German
[01:54:53.300 --> 01:55:00.500]  or French or British or Russian, it is bad to be white. That's what I was taught in
[01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:04.540]  public school. That's what I was taught at college and when I got out. It didn't matter
[01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:08.420]  what class it was. They would go to the front. It was always a white person and tell me
[01:55:08.420 --> 01:55:14.420]  how bad white people are and how wonderful it is that we're going to die off. Then if
[01:55:14.420 --> 01:55:20.180]  you say, well, I'm not bad. I like everybody else's culture, but it's not bad if you're
[01:55:20.180 --> 01:55:29.120]  proud of being Scottish or Irish or that your great, great granddaddy was British or German.
[01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:35.740]  What does that mean? Oh, like everybody's culture, but the cracker. Notice the message
[01:55:35.740 --> 01:55:42.260]  is if you don't like socialism or if you call Obama socialist, you are a cracker. There's
[01:55:42.260 --> 01:55:46.380]  nothing worse than being a white person. What do you think the N word is? It's saying you
[01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:52.780]  are black and you're not worth anything. It's bad to be black and now it's bad to be white.
[01:55:52.780 --> 01:55:57.740]  And there's a celebration. You watch the culture, the media, it's all destroy your culture,
[01:55:57.740 --> 01:56:01.380]  destroy your culture because the globalists don't want any cultures out there. They want
[01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:05.740]  to erase your culture so they can replace it with the corporate abortion culture, the
[01:56:05.740 --> 01:56:12.060]  corporate euthanasia culture and slime ball and Mr. Maddow and all the rest of them on
[01:56:12.060 --> 01:56:21.500]  that network. They hate strength. They hate unity. They hate anything that's established.
[01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:25.260]  There are some really bad spots in the Muslim world. There are some oppressive systems and
[01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:31.300]  I don't support a lot of it, but they are still anti abortion, anti globalist. And so
[01:56:31.300 --> 01:56:38.540]  because they don't totally give themselves over to MTV with TV shows telling young girls
[01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:44.980]  how cool it is. They have a show about how cool it is to have abortions because the Muslims
[01:56:44.980 --> 01:56:49.900]  won't give up their cultures and their family and won't give into the corrupt banking system.
[01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:55.140]  They're against the usury and the rest of it. They have to be eradicated. They have to
[01:56:55.140 --> 01:57:03.860]  be destroyed because that culture is far superior to this corporate oid death culture. So anything
[01:57:03.860 --> 01:57:09.340]  that won't give into the new world order is bad. And so if you're Christian, you're bad.
[01:57:09.340 --> 01:57:13.100]  If you've got any type of values, you're bad. If you want to be a steward of liberty, you're
[01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:17.540]  bad. And remember what Margaret Singer said in all those letters. She said, we've got
[01:57:17.540 --> 01:57:22.820]  opposes liberals. We've got a higher black leaders. We've got the blacks will never
[01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:27.460]  suspect us. If we act like we're fighting for their civil rights, that way we can get
[01:57:27.460 --> 01:57:33.300]  close and get rid of these weeds. And those are in letters to the Colgate's letters to
[01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:37.300]  the Rockefellers. They openly funded her. They openly funded Hitler and the Kaiser
[01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:41.940]  Ville Institute, and they have done a good job. I kept saying 51% of blacks since Roe
[01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:47.420]  V. Wade haven't been born. I'm sorry, 52%. And so if you're for killing 52% of blacks,
[01:57:47.420 --> 01:57:54.020]  you're liberal, you're good. But if you're against killing 52% of blacks, you're a cracker,
[01:57:54.020 --> 01:58:00.460]  scum, racist. These are limousine liberals. These are poverty pimps. Look what they've
[01:58:00.460 --> 01:58:08.820]  done to the black community. In the 1940s, blacks had below 50% out of wedlock marriages.
[01:58:08.820 --> 01:58:14.540]  They had their own thriving, very wealthy communities, their own powerful colleges.
[01:58:14.540 --> 01:58:21.380]  And the system came in and destroyed all of that. And I'm not saying that changes weren't
[01:58:21.380 --> 01:58:25.420]  needed. I'm saying the changes that were brought in were to come in and say, here's some money,
[01:58:25.420 --> 01:58:29.540]  don't have a man in the house. Because we're going to put your kids in prison. The social
[01:58:29.540 --> 01:58:34.180]  engineers knew that. They didn't tell mama that though. See, so that's what Chris Matthews
[01:58:34.180 --> 01:58:41.700]  and all of them are. They are poverty pimped 21st century children of the Nazis.
[01:58:41.700 --> 01:58:51.580]  On air, online, and on demand. We are the GCN radio network.
[01:58:51.580 --> 01:58:56.060]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over. It ended on June
[01:58:56.060 --> 01:59:01.820]  of 2009. The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree. Perhaps a recession
[01:59:01.820 --> 01:59:05.820]  ended for the bankers and government employees. But for the rest of us, things seem to be
[01:59:05.820 --> 01:59:10.060]  getting worse. Gold and silver haven't heard the news either. They've begun their long
[01:59:10.060 --> 01:59:14.260]  expected journey to the moon. In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into
[01:59:14.260 --> 01:59:18.780]  gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct. They both
[01:59:18.780 --> 01:59:23.980]  make fabulous investments. Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious
[01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:29.300]  than any financial resource. You and your family need food to survive a crisis. And you can't
[01:59:29.300 --> 01:59:34.180]  eat paper, stocks or metals. Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy fix
[01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:38.580]  meals to enjoy now or save for long term. This will freeze the cost to your food while

[02:00:09.620 --> 02:00:23.940]  Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.940 --> 02:00:28.980]  So much of this attack on Obama has been at hominem, directed at the person, the president.
[02:00:28.980 --> 02:00:33.060]  Whether it's somebody, some crack around there on the right calling him, some birth third
[02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:37.300]  type who says he's not an American, or it's somebody a little more sophisticated but basically
[02:00:37.300 --> 02:00:44.260]  saying he's a socialist. Now, I've got Glenn Spencer on because he's advised Congress,
[02:00:44.260 --> 02:00:49.500]  he's testified all over the country to legislatures. He's been fighting for several decades in California
[02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:54.380]  and now in Arizona for many years on the border. They bought property there to demonstrate
[02:00:54.380 --> 02:00:58.340]  that they haven't built a physical fence except for show, that they don't let the National
[02:00:58.340 --> 02:01:03.060]  Guard actually engage in any action to defend the country, that the border patrol has their
[02:01:03.060 --> 02:01:09.180]  hands tied. And now they've canceled the virtual fence. And I want to talk about that coming
[02:01:09.180 --> 02:01:14.860]  up in the next segment. But first, I wanted to get into the left using multiculturalism
[02:01:14.860 --> 02:01:19.380]  to basically sacrifice the U.S. on the altar of globalism as you've coined the term more
[02:01:19.380 --> 02:01:25.860]  than a decade ago in your conquest of Oslon films that are so powerful with how they create
[02:01:25.860 --> 02:01:30.820]  racial movements in Hispanics and blacks funded by the Ford Foundation, but then tell white
[02:01:30.820 --> 02:01:34.820]  people if you're against healthcare, you're a racist. So that's used to make whites all
[02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:39.900]  guilty and stand down, but then used so that blacks, whites, Hispanics don't get along
[02:01:39.900 --> 02:01:44.940]  to actually try to get them into their own racial liberation theology system. And to
[02:01:44.940 --> 02:01:49.620]  now see Chris Matthews saying if you don't like government healthcare, you're a racist.
[02:01:49.620 --> 02:01:53.580]  And now saying if you don't like healthcare, you're a cracker. I mean, they're now really
[02:01:53.580 --> 02:01:57.580]  getting to the point of trying to invoke that whites are bad. It looks like they're getting
[02:01:57.580 --> 02:02:07.740]  desperate, Glenn Spencer. Well, the pressure is getting to them. The people using the internet
[02:02:07.740 --> 02:02:14.260]  listening to your program are bypassing the mainstream media. They're getting the truth.
[02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:23.420]  And people like Chris Matthews realized it. And so they're lashing out. And as Peter Brimelow
[02:02:23.420 --> 02:02:31.020]  once said, a racist is someone who disagrees with a liberal and or is winning an argument
[02:02:31.020 --> 02:02:37.500]  with a liberal. And we're winning the arguments. So that's the last bastion is to call people
[02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:42.220]  racist and crackers.
[02:02:42.220 --> 02:02:46.500]  But it's amazing. I mean, don't they know that they're bleeding out publicly? Now it
[02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:49.460]  turns out the Tucson shooter, I'm going to get your take on that also because you're
[02:02:49.460 --> 02:02:56.540]  in Arizona, Glenn was a G string wearing Bush hating a super liberal. I mean, he's the opposite
[02:02:56.540 --> 02:03:00.660]  of a concern, but it was another hoax by them. It turns out that sheriff and others that
[02:03:00.660 --> 02:03:04.540]  day already had his documents and already knew all about him.
[02:03:04.540 --> 02:03:05.540]  Right.
[02:03:05.540 --> 02:03:16.460]  And of course, the nature reaction was to blame those who are proposing that we enforce
[02:03:16.460 --> 02:03:26.260]  our immigration law. And that's what that's what that initial reaction was all about.
[02:03:26.260 --> 02:03:34.380]  They were blaming the slaying of six people, the injury of our congresswoman. She's my
[02:03:34.380 --> 02:03:45.700]  congresswoman on those who supported Senate bill 1070. I was at a candlelight vigil for
[02:03:45.700 --> 02:03:52.300]  Gabrielle Giffords at her local office here in Sierra Vista that evening, Saturday evening,
[02:03:52.300 --> 02:03:59.340]  and I was there. And some of them started saying, stop the hate, stop the hate. And
[02:03:59.340 --> 02:04:04.380]  I said, what are you talking about? Where was the evidence? I mean, there are going
[02:04:04.380 --> 02:04:09.780]  to be lessons learned from this. Let's learn the right lesson. And a woman standing next
[02:04:09.780 --> 02:04:14.100]  to me at this candlelight vigil. They didn't know much about what happened. She says,
[02:04:14.100 --> 02:04:22.140]  I'm an attorney and hate speech isn't protected by the First Amendment. Well, I don't care
[02:04:22.140 --> 02:04:26.700]  what you call it, but it is protected by the First Amendment. And the hate speech wasn't
[02:04:26.700 --> 02:04:31.620]  involved. And we all know that now. And those of us who are living, I was linked in one
[02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:37.260]  of the stories that they linked American border patrol. And what we do is apply technology
[02:04:37.260 --> 02:04:41.060]  to the border as inciting to this type of behavior.
[02:04:41.060 --> 02:04:46.060]  Glenn Spencer, stay there. Nobody has been on that border like you with the drones, the
[02:04:46.060 --> 02:04:51.420]  research, advising Congress. I mean, we're going to get exactly the state of that border,
[02:04:51.420 --> 02:04:57.740]  the real report, the briefing from you coming up. And then we're going to, of course, first
[02:04:57.740 --> 02:05:01.220]  finish up with them trying to blame you and others myself for the maniac.
[02:05:01.220 --> 02:05:05.860]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:05.860 --> 02:05:10.340]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number
[02:05:10.340 --> 02:05:14.860]  two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[02:05:14.860 --> 02:05:20.460]  you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[02:05:20.460 --> 02:05:25.860]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:30.900]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous
[02:05:30.900 --> 02:05:35.100]  weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their
[02:05:35.100 --> 02:05:39.740]  power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful
[02:05:39.740 --> 02:05:43.900]  backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[02:05:43.900 --> 02:05:48.220]  offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information

[02:08:18.460 --> 02:08:31.140]  You talk about spreading hate. Chris Matthews calling any white people that don't like social
[02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:37.140]  as health care, white crackers. That's like saying if black people didn't like something
[02:08:37.140 --> 02:08:43.020]  calling them black inwards. They're trying to spread the hate. The so-called left in
[02:08:43.020 --> 02:08:49.020]  this country are a bunch of social engineering globalists who want us all divided and conquered.
[02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:54.060]  It's very cold-blooded, but it's big city politics. Now Glenn Spencer is down right
[02:08:54.060 --> 02:09:01.260]  on the border. He's been there for many years in Arizona. He's the head of AmericanPatrol.com
[02:09:01.260 --> 02:09:06.220]  and he's an activist who has advocated greater vigilance in securing the United States border
[02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:09.660]  against illegal immigration. He's the founder of the American Border Patrol Group based
[02:09:09.660 --> 02:09:16.340]  in Sierra Vista, Arizona, and he joins us. Now he flies drones, radio-controlled aircraft
[02:09:16.340 --> 02:09:21.260]  up and down the border. He documents that there really is no security down there. They're
[02:09:21.260 --> 02:09:27.620]  only looking for unauthorized drug shipments, and even that is done in a half-hearted way.
[02:09:27.620 --> 02:09:32.060]  But finishing up, because Glenn just joined us in the last segment, he was also blamed
[02:09:32.060 --> 02:09:39.140]  for causing the Tucson rampage, and he joins us from his home, the headquarters of American
[02:09:39.140 --> 02:09:43.700]  Border Patrol, overlooking. He's looking into Mexico right now as he joins us. He has been
[02:09:43.700 --> 02:09:51.260]  blamed. I have been blamed for the shooting, and it turns out, of course, Jared Lee Loeffner
[02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:55.260]  was completely out of his mind. But before he went out of his mind from daily intake
[02:09:55.260 --> 02:10:01.300]  of a powerful hallucinogen that grows naturally in the area, he hated Bush and was considered
[02:10:01.300 --> 02:10:05.740]  himself, quote, ultra-liberal, and that's now even in the New York Times. But they don't
[02:10:05.740 --> 02:10:10.020]  care, and they have people running around. Glenn was talking about being in an event,
[02:10:10.020 --> 02:10:14.780]  candlelight vigil, and a lawyer saying, free speeches and hate speech. And I heard NPR
[02:10:14.780 --> 02:10:20.060]  this weekend said they need to ban speech in America and take over talk radio. So these
[02:10:20.060 --> 02:10:27.260]  are authoritarians posing as liberals. Glenn Spencer, this is blown up in their face, though,
[02:10:27.260 --> 02:10:31.620]  but they still don't care. They're not backtracking. They're still blaming Alex Jones, Glenn Spencer,
[02:10:31.620 --> 02:10:39.620]  John Paul, Sarah Palin. I mean, it's insane. Well, that's right. And since this hit the
[02:10:39.620 --> 02:10:46.820]  mainstream media, we're one of the most effective activists or groups on the border. We're a
[02:10:46.820 --> 02:10:52.300]  nonprofit organization. I also have my own blog, AmericanProtrol.com. But American Border
[02:10:52.300 --> 02:10:58.660]  Patrol is a nonprofit. 501c3 Corporation has been in existence in good standing for eight
[02:10:58.660 --> 02:11:04.820]  years. We are one of the leaders on the issue of cracking down on our border and telling
[02:11:04.820 --> 02:11:12.900]  the people the truth. Now, you know, all of these media in Tucson, they came rushing out
[02:11:12.900 --> 02:11:20.900]  here, right? They tasted blood. They thought they were going to destroy SB 1070 and those
[02:11:20.900 --> 02:11:25.740]  in Arizona who want the law in force. But I will tell you something with all the media
[02:11:25.740 --> 02:11:34.580]  here, two major media outlets came to the range to talk to me. One was one of the most
[02:11:34.580 --> 02:11:41.940]  important, significant newspapers on the planet. One was an enormous TV network. They came
[02:11:41.940 --> 02:11:50.100]  down to get my views of this issue. One was from London, and the other one was from Tokyo.
[02:11:50.100 --> 02:11:56.420]  The rest of them don't want to talk to me. Well, I want to throw something out here
[02:11:56.420 --> 02:12:02.780]  briefly. They're having a big battle in Texas right now because the legislature wants to
[02:12:02.780 --> 02:12:10.820]  just have the driver's license test in English only, obviously for road signs and other things.
[02:12:10.820 --> 02:12:14.020]  And they do give illegal aliens driver's license here. They're illegal, but they give them
[02:12:14.020 --> 02:12:20.260]  driver's license and the Mexican consulate is whining and complaining. But in Mexico,
[02:12:20.260 --> 02:12:25.420]  you can only get a driver's license in Spanish and the test is only in Spanish. If you're
[02:12:25.420 --> 02:12:30.020]  an illegal alien in Mexico, they clap you in irons and put you in a forced labor camp.
[02:12:30.020 --> 02:12:33.940]  Every other country in the world only gives their driving test in German or French or
[02:12:33.940 --> 02:12:39.620]  English, whatever the country is. Why in America do we have to do this? It's all about breaking
[02:12:39.620 --> 02:12:44.340]  the country down. They don't want foreigners that come here to learn English and assimilate
[02:12:44.340 --> 02:12:50.540]  and be friends. They want to keep you in the barrio or the slum so that poverty pimps can
[02:12:50.540 --> 02:12:58.700]  control you. Well, I mean, let's go over the true developments. We're all hearing about
[02:12:58.700 --> 02:13:03.180]  they've canceled the virtual fence. Let's talk about that. Let's talk about the facts
[02:13:03.180 --> 02:13:07.300]  of what's really going on on the border from Texas to California. You are the leading
[02:13:07.300 --> 02:13:10.380]  expert on this. Tell us what's really going on.
[02:13:10.380 --> 02:13:16.380]  All right. If you want to back up to what I'm saying, just go to American Patrol.com
[02:13:16.380 --> 02:13:21.420]  and look at down at the, just a little below it says past features. You can go in the recent
[02:13:21.420 --> 02:13:30.100]  couple of days. I've been featuring this issue. The virtual fence was announced in 2006. And
[02:13:30.100 --> 02:13:35.060]  I've been down on the border now almost nine years. I've been at this issue for 19 years
[02:13:35.060 --> 02:13:46.980]  full time. And you can see that this is what I said on my website July 5th, 2006. Okay.
[02:13:46.980 --> 02:13:52.740]  This is almost five years ago. I was responding to the announcement that there was going to
[02:13:52.740 --> 02:14:01.860]  be a SBIs Strategic Border Initiative built. Now, this is my very quote. Nowhere does SBIs
[02:14:01.860 --> 02:14:08.540]  spell out a goal that can be measured. This is all of the same nonsense we have seen for
[02:14:08.540 --> 02:14:17.420]  years. The program will be run by open borders people at EHSPPB and will accomplish absolutely
[02:14:17.420 --> 02:14:24.500]  nothing except lull the people into a false sense of security. That was almost five years
[02:14:24.500 --> 02:14:27.380]  ago. Was I right?
[02:14:27.380 --> 02:14:30.860]  You were absolutely right. And I remember you on this broadcast saying Bush was just
[02:14:30.860 --> 02:14:37.860]  doing that as a stunt to basically get conservatives to go along with the North American Union
[02:14:37.860 --> 02:14:42.660]  and total legalization of illegals. And that has now turned out to be true. So we've talked
[02:14:42.660 --> 02:14:49.740]  about the virtual fence. They're now canceling that stunt that was never built or done. Now,
[02:14:49.740 --> 02:14:58.460]  moving on to the non-existent cardboard box fence they built, the other stunt. I mean tell
[02:14:58.460 --> 02:15:02.060]  folks what the National Guard's doing. That's another stunt. I mean let's go through the
[02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:03.940]  so-called security on that border.
[02:15:03.940 --> 02:15:14.740]  Well, what I said here on my side, January 16, 2011, I had attended a meeting, a conference
[02:15:14.740 --> 02:15:21.460]  on the Secure Border Initiative in February of 2007. It was like a bidder's conference
[02:15:21.460 --> 02:15:28.420]  held by the DHS to explain to people how the system was going to work. And I have a quote
[02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:39.020]  to it. I was at that conference and I asked, there was a panel there. And I said, the only
[02:15:39.020 --> 02:15:44.620]  border legislation passed by Congress last year was the Secure Fence Act of 2006. It
[02:15:44.620 --> 02:15:49.340]  calls for 700 miles of two-tiered fencing to be built along the border. I haven't heard
[02:15:49.340 --> 02:15:53.940]  this fence being discussed within the context of the Strategic Border Initiative. Why is
[02:15:53.940 --> 02:16:00.540]  this? What I was asking you is why would you need an electronic fence when you were building
[02:16:00.540 --> 02:16:06.660]  a double-layered physical fence and were you coordinating this? The answer was this was
[02:16:06.660 --> 02:16:13.180]  above their pay grade. They couldn't answer me. Well, years later I discovered the answer.
[02:16:13.180 --> 02:16:20.740]  The answer is this. Listen to this very carefully. The virtual fence was never intended to work
[02:16:20.740 --> 02:16:25.580]  together with the real fence because George Bush never intended to build a real fence.
[02:16:25.580 --> 02:16:31.140]  And for that matter, the virtual fence itself was never designed to work. The entire fence
[02:16:31.140 --> 02:16:38.820]  story, virtual and real, was conjured up to convince the American people that Congress
[02:16:38.820 --> 02:16:44.340]  could move ahead with amnesty legislation knowing that the border would be secured.
[02:16:44.340 --> 02:16:50.420]  That's what that was all about. It was a sham. The problem was, in the final minutes
[02:16:50.420 --> 02:16:57.380]  of the amnesty debate, Senator Elizabeth Dole got up and pointed out that only two miles
[02:16:57.380 --> 02:17:05.420]  of the 700-mile double-layered fence had been built. She helped defeat the legislation.
[02:17:05.420 --> 02:17:11.740]  But what amnesty did, the Bush administration was in a pickle. They were stuck with a fence
[02:17:11.740 --> 02:17:19.740]  they never intended to build. To solve that, they got Texas Governor, Senator Hutchinson
[02:17:19.740 --> 02:17:26.860]  to sneak in a last-minute amendment to build a ticket. So the recent demise of the virtual
[02:17:26.860 --> 02:17:36.380]  fence is the final chapter in a sordid story of deception and dishonesty. The whole thing,
[02:17:36.380 --> 02:17:43.700]  the physical fence, the virtual fence, that was all a sham to convince us that they were
[02:17:43.700 --> 02:17:49.460]  finally going to do something about the border. And when we kill them to speak, then they
[02:17:49.460 --> 02:17:56.860]  killed the fence. They never intended to build it, and they don't intend to do it now.
[02:17:56.860 --> 02:18:01.420]  And that's it. I've also seen you on the side in your video of this. You break down
[02:18:01.420 --> 02:18:06.180]  what the National Guard is allowed to do, how they just go and stand there on a hilltop
[02:18:06.180 --> 02:18:11.860]  with a light on at night, and it's just a complete joke. But then now the hatred of
[02:18:11.860 --> 02:18:16.660]  the U.S. has been so ingrained in the schools in Mexico and other things, and the infusora,
[02:18:16.660 --> 02:18:21.980]  the la Reconquista is so loved that now the Mexican troops and others are shooting at
[02:18:21.980 --> 02:18:28.700]  highway workers many miles over the U.S. border. When the poor man got killed out there jet
[02:18:28.700 --> 02:18:32.620]  skiing on the Texas lake on the border, the media said it was a lie, even though it was
[02:18:32.620 --> 02:18:37.980]  admittedly true. I mean, they are really trying to deny what's happening down there on that
[02:18:37.980 --> 02:18:38.980]  border.
[02:18:38.980 --> 02:18:47.820]  Well, there's no question about it. We have evidence that I show to the Japanese film
[02:18:47.820 --> 02:18:56.980]  crew today that we gathered last night, but it's so incredible that we can't go public
[02:18:56.980 --> 02:19:04.420]  with it because they'll kill us. They'll kill us if they found out what we can do. I'm not
[02:19:04.420 --> 02:19:11.420]  kidding. I used to go public with this stuff no longer. They're right on the border there.
[02:19:11.420 --> 02:19:16.740]  I just, I'm just, I can't say anything more because they'll kill me.
[02:19:16.740 --> 02:19:21.460]  So they are directly there with the narcotics and goodies right in, right in plain view.
[02:19:21.460 --> 02:19:25.980]  Oh yeah. Well, you have to know what you're doing. You don't have to know where to look.
[02:19:25.980 --> 02:19:36.980]  Within a mile of my house. But according to Sean Hannity, if you want the border secured,
[02:19:36.980 --> 02:19:41.260]  you're a dumb cracker. And if you don't like government run your healthcare, you're an
[02:19:41.260 --> 02:19:42.260]  evil white demon.
[02:19:42.260 --> 02:19:45.260]  Did you say Sean Hannity?
[02:19:45.260 --> 02:19:52.900]  Excuse me. I was not Sean Hannity. I apologize. What's his name? Slimeball. Chris Matthews.
[02:19:52.900 --> 02:19:56.580]  I was thinking, I have another video up with Chris Matthews attacking Sean Hannity. That's
[02:19:56.580 --> 02:20:03.820]  how I sent that. I just can't keep track of it all the way right back.
[02:20:03.820 --> 02:20:09.440]  This is not a drill. Repeat. This is not a drill. Gun cells are on a staggering pace.
[02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:13.660]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want
[02:20:13.660 --> 02:20:18.780]  your guns and will do anything to get them. Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for
[02:20:18.780 --> 02:20:23.660]  hiding your guns from thieves and looters. You'll learn step by step, battle-harden techniques.
[02:20:23.660 --> 02:20:27.460]  Where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them. How to create the perfect
[02:20:27.460 --> 02:20:33.260]  hiding place as well as the places you should never hide your guns under any circumstance.
[02:20:33.260 --> 02:20:37.060]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons
[02:20:37.060 --> 02:20:42.260]  safe and out of sight when the going gets tough. But listen up. For security reasons,
[02:20:42.260 --> 02:20:47.220]  the hide your guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.

[02:20:55.620 --> 02:21:02.020]  your guns. Hideyourguns.com right now.
[02:21:02.020 --> 02:21:06.020]  Gold isn't for you. Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier
[02:21:06.020 --> 02:21:10.700]  gold and precious metal investing firms. I get it. You wouldn't buy gold if you believed
[02:21:10.700 --> 02:21:14.820]  that the government is doing a great job that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of
[02:21:14.820 --> 02:21:19.380]  dollars like bailout candy that social security would be there for you. That's not what's
[02:21:19.380 --> 02:21:24.460]  happening. You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation
[02:21:24.460 --> 02:21:28.660]  or that the dollar wouldn't lose value or that your retirement would be secure. If all
[02:21:28.660 --> 02:21:32.820]  looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold. For the realists, there have
[02:21:32.820 --> 02:21:38.380]  never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold. Since 2001, the US dollar index
[02:21:38.380 --> 02:21:44.180]  has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%. Right now, savvy investors are adding gold
[02:21:44.180 --> 02:21:48.340]  to their portfolios. You should, too. Find out what they know. Call us and I'll send
[02:21:48.340 --> 02:22:01.060]  you 10 reasons why gold will do very well. Free 800-686-2237. 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:01.060 --> 02:22:06.260]  They helped to create a new world order. We are part of a new world order. A new world
[02:22:06.260 --> 02:22:11.980]  order based upon collective action. Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists
[02:22:11.980 --> 02:22:16.700]  through their own words and documents. The new world order really is a tool for addressing
[02:22:16.700 --> 02:22:21.460]  a new world of possibilities. It means all the world under their control. The United
[02:22:21.460 --> 02:22:27.140]  Nations would take over America. The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world. Invisible
[02:22:27.140 --> 02:22:32.740]  Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish
[02:22:32.740 --> 02:22:37.260]  an oppressive world government. I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short
[02:22:37.260 --> 02:22:41.820]  of a world constitution for the global financial system. Global governance with the establishment
[02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:46.980]  of the G20. So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news
[02:22:46.980 --> 02:22:53.740]  for you. You're everyone else. Invisible Empire, secure your copy today at infowars.com or

[02:24:01.700 --> 02:24:15.660]  All right, final segment with Glenn Spencer giving us a report from the border. It's a
[02:24:15.660 --> 02:24:21.020]  complete hoax that there is basically any security down there. And my issue is they're
[02:24:21.020 --> 02:24:25.940]  putting this whole police state grid in for the American people, spy networks, telescreens
[02:24:25.940 --> 02:24:30.620]  at Walmart saying watch your neighbor. But then meanwhile our southern border is completely
[02:24:30.620 --> 02:24:36.020]  wide open. What is the state of the Republic? What's the state of this globalist Ford Foundation
[02:24:36.020 --> 02:24:37.820]  movement, Glenn Spencer?
[02:24:37.820 --> 02:24:47.100]  Well, you know, they see the trend in Congress. They saw the vote last November. They see
[02:24:47.100 --> 02:24:52.540]  the coming chairmanship of the committee. And they realized that their tactic of threatening
[02:24:52.540 --> 02:25:00.780]  America, marching through our streets with the Mexican flags, fell short. It didn't do
[02:25:00.780 --> 02:25:07.100]  the job. In fact, there's a backlash. So they're laying low right now. You've got people in
[02:25:07.100 --> 02:25:13.780]  the Bicorne case right here in Tucson. You can't hear you. There's nothing coming out
[02:25:13.780 --> 02:25:22.100]  of them. I think eventually you're going to see something, but it is going to be passive.
[02:25:22.100 --> 02:25:27.980]  What do you think of the movie like machete, which was like something that the Klan would
[02:25:27.980 --> 02:25:32.720]  make if they were trying to demonize black people? I mean, it was so racial, so hateful
[02:25:32.720 --> 02:25:38.420]  and then painted whites as, you know, buck toothed murderers of Hispanic unborn babies
[02:25:38.420 --> 02:25:46.780]  running around bloodthirstily. And I mean, it's just so over the top.
[02:25:46.780 --> 02:25:57.820]  Well, you know, we warned that if that could lead to unrest, okay, and it did in Los Angeles,
[02:25:57.820 --> 02:26:02.140]  all around where that show was where it was showing, there were attacks on police. There
[02:26:02.140 --> 02:26:08.860]  were riots down in West Lake Park. It was a disaster. Excuse me, because I know you're
[02:26:08.860 --> 02:26:12.780]  tied into this nationwide. I was not aware of this. I would search the term machete and
[02:26:12.780 --> 02:26:18.540]  see record amounts of machete attacks around the country and a few events. I may have to
[02:26:18.540 --> 02:26:22.300]  hold you over. I know Tarpley's coming up, but excuse me. I'm going to have to have
[02:26:22.300 --> 02:26:25.180]  you back up. We're going to have to write an article about this because, you know, Drudge
[02:26:25.180 --> 02:26:30.140]  and others have carried our reports on it. The state did deny Rodriguez funding of 1.7
[02:26:30.140 --> 02:26:35.300]  million over it, you know, with the state phone commission funding. But you're telling
[02:26:35.300 --> 02:26:39.740]  me that there was violence from that? No question about it. We have it up on our website.
[02:26:39.740 --> 02:26:44.940]  We had the sites of the violence and where the machete was playing.
[02:26:44.940 --> 02:26:47.740]  What website of your two? And what was the headline? I must get this down.
[02:26:47.740 --> 02:26:57.180]  I have to pick it up. I think it was the September 8th, 2010. I have a here rioting in the street.
[02:26:57.180 --> 02:27:01.900]  And this is where machete is playing. It was all around where this rioting was going on.
[02:27:03.340 --> 02:27:05.500]  Oh my gosh. So what happened? Break it down.
[02:27:05.500 --> 02:27:10.700]  Yeah, this is where the LAPD, he had a shooting of an immigrant who was wielding a knife on
[02:27:10.700 --> 02:27:18.700]  September 8th. He was wielding a machete. I remember hearing about all those riots,
[02:27:18.700 --> 02:27:21.340]  and I didn't put two and two together. The media covered it up.
[02:27:21.340 --> 02:27:22.700]  Absolutely. Wow.
[02:27:24.300 --> 02:27:28.140]  At least 22 arrested at Westlake has protested the whole object that police
[02:27:28.140 --> 02:27:36.620]  stopped. This was while machete was playing all around Westlake. Well, it shows white
[02:27:36.620 --> 02:27:41.420]  politicians being murdered en masse. I mean, and it says kill them, kill them now.
[02:27:41.980 --> 02:27:46.460]  And I keep it secret, the secret uprising. And then I see the Los Angeles billboards
[02:27:46.460 --> 02:27:49.500]  saying this is no longer LA. This is now Mexico. Correct.
[02:27:49.500 --> 02:27:53.340]  And the radio stations, but it's in Spanish, so folks don't know this is going on.
[02:27:53.340 --> 02:28:00.540]  Right. They didn't want you to know. September 8th, American Patrol dot com. Just look at it.
[02:28:01.180 --> 02:28:05.420]  No, I'm going to get Aaron Dykes to pick it up and do an article on it that we weren't aware
[02:28:05.420 --> 02:28:11.420]  of. I mean, I saw some of the unrest, but didn't connect it. But what other intel do you have
[02:28:11.420 --> 02:28:16.860]  that being generated by machete? Oh, that's the main one right there. It was put on for two or
[02:28:16.860 --> 02:28:24.300]  three nights. And they put it down pretty hard because they knew that if this got out of hand,
[02:28:24.300 --> 02:28:31.420]  they had a serious problem. Yeah, I'm not for false flags, but if it could just get out of hand
[02:28:31.420 --> 02:28:35.500]  now, then folks would recognize this secret threat that's being built by the Ford Foundation.
[02:28:35.500 --> 02:28:38.220]  And there is no doubt that this is the Ford Foundation. Correct.
[02:28:39.020 --> 02:28:44.940]  Oh, of course not. There's no doubt at all. I mean, they've been at the root of all of these
[02:28:44.940 --> 02:28:52.860]  problems for 40 years. And then look at Slimeball Chris Matthews attacking Limbaugh,
[02:28:52.860 --> 02:28:59.580]  Sean Hannity, you, myself, everybody under the sun. I ran for the shooting when we had nothing
[02:28:59.580 --> 02:29:08.220]  to do with it. And now calling us crackers. I mean, is he trying to incite something?
[02:29:08.860 --> 02:29:11.740]  Because that's not going to help them if they incite something. It's going to show what's going
[02:29:11.740 --> 02:29:15.660]  on. Yeah, but, you know, when Art Torres, the head of the California Democrat Party,
[02:29:15.660 --> 02:29:22.860]  after Prop 187 passed, he said Prop 187 was the last gasp of white America in California.
[02:29:23.500 --> 02:29:29.900]  Did anybody jump on that? That when Mario Obelido, the co-founder of Valdem, after...
[02:29:29.900 --> 02:29:32.620]  I tell you what, stay there. Do five more minutes with us. Then we're getting terribly
[02:29:32.620 --> 02:29:36.940]  on in the Tunisia situation. I want to come back and play some of these actual audio clips of it
[02:29:36.940 --> 02:29:41.020]  being said. I want to live in peace with everybody. But when folks are beating war drums and running
[02:29:41.020 --> 02:29:45.420]  flags up and telling school kids they can't wear American flags, we got a problem. So let's be
[02:29:45.420 --> 02:29:54.540]  open about this. I mean, do we want this to be Oslon? We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.420 --> 02:29:58.300]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.580 --> 02:30:06.220]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over. It ended on June
[02:30:06.220 --> 02:30:12.300]  of 2009. The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree. Perhaps the recession ended
[02:30:12.300 --> 02:30:16.860]  for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:30:16.860 --> 02:30:21.500]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either. They've begun their long expected journey to the
[02:30:21.500 --> 02:30:26.140]  moon. In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider
[02:30:26.140 --> 02:30:31.740]  a food savings account from eFoodsDirect. They both make fabulous investments. Food is our greatest
[02:30:31.740 --> 02:30:36.860]  dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource. You and your family
[02:30:36.860 --> 02:30:42.300]  need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals. Alex has been urging
[02:30:42.300 --> 02:30:47.420]  you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term. This will freeze
[02:30:47.420 --> 02:30:52.380]  the cost of your food while you can still afford it. Visit eFoodsDirect.com on the internet,
[02:30:52.380 --> 02:31:01.660]  or call 800-409-5633. That's eFoodsDirect.com, or 800-409-5633.
[02:31:22.380 --> 02:31:33.660]  South, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow. I'm looking for America.
[02:31:33.660 --> 02:31:55.820]  Where American and be proud, go to Gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:31:55.820 --> 02:32:02.780]  Again, go to Gusset.com forward slash America today. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[02:32:02.780 --> 02:32:07.980]  you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily
[02:32:07.980 --> 02:32:12.940]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much
[02:32:12.940 --> 02:32:18.220]  power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity
[02:32:18.220 --> 02:32:23.180]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[02:32:23.180 --> 02:32:28.700]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded, and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[02:32:28.700 --> 02:32:33.420]  the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year,
[02:32:33.420 --> 02:32:38.060]  thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power
[02:32:38.060 --> 02:32:42.460]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the
[02:32:42.460 --> 02:32:46.940]  solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get
[02:32:46.940 --> 02:32:53.580]  more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government
[02:32:53.580 --> 02:33:00.140]  doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:33:03.580 --> 02:33:09.580]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:09.580 --> 02:33:25.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:30.620 --> 02:33:35.180]  You know, he's got hundreds of these clips, and it's in his films, the Conquest of Oslo,
[02:33:35.180 --> 02:33:41.180]  he made several of them, and you'll see video, your audio. They've got the UT Hispanic studies
[02:33:41.180 --> 02:33:49.500]  head saying, you know, we've got to have the plan of San Diego. We've got to, you know, drive the
[02:33:49.500 --> 02:33:54.540]  whites out. Of course, I learned about plan of San Diego six, seven years ago in an event. People
[02:33:54.540 --> 02:34:02.540]  were wearing plan of San Diego shirts, and a Hispanic guy told me, you know what that means.
[02:34:02.540 --> 02:34:08.620]  I said no, and that was a German government plan in World War I to fund Hispanics to rise up and
[02:34:08.620 --> 02:34:15.340]  kill all whites in Texas down to the age of 16, and they actually implemented the plan,
[02:34:15.340 --> 02:34:19.900]  but then the Texas Rangers put it down. But we're going to go to Webster Tarpoli here in a moment.
[02:34:20.460 --> 02:34:24.060]  Finishing up, you've got some of these audio clips of what these folks have been saying,
[02:34:24.060 --> 02:34:27.660]  and then if you don't roll over to it, they say it's your fault there was the Tucson shooting.
[02:34:27.660 --> 02:34:33.740]  Oh, that's right. And this has been going on for years. I just, by the way, switched computers and
[02:34:34.780 --> 02:34:38.060]  may have a little trouble pulling some of those things up on another computer in another room,
[02:34:38.060 --> 02:34:45.340]  but I can give you one really good one. Okay. This is Art Torres, chairman of the California
[02:34:45.340 --> 02:34:54.620]  Democrat Party, telling this audience of those, the Acheban, that they have to take power. They
[02:34:54.620 --> 02:34:58.140]  don't, it's not going to be given to you. You have to take it. So just listen to this.
[02:35:01.500 --> 02:35:12.060]  Power is not given to you. You have to take it. Remember, 187 is the last gas of white America
[02:35:12.060 --> 02:35:20.060]  in California. Okay. The last gas of white America in California. And here is the head
[02:35:20.060 --> 02:35:28.220]  of the California Democrat Party. But anybody on the Republican side has said anything close to that.
[02:35:28.780 --> 02:35:35.020]  Okay. Such as if we don't pass one of these seven, it will be the last gas of white American
[02:35:35.020 --> 02:35:42.060]  California. They would have been crucified. So people have to understand once and for all.
[02:35:42.060 --> 02:35:50.140]  There was a double standard. All right. And I'm going to say that if you're a white European,
[02:35:51.180 --> 02:36:02.940]  you are assumed guilty before proven innocent. If you're anything else, you're innocent
[02:36:03.740 --> 02:36:08.620]  until proven innocent. Well, that's it. I mean, you buy into all the multiculturalism. I've got,
[02:36:08.620 --> 02:36:14.300]  I hire people of every color, creed in my office. I like everybody, but the media is always trying
[02:36:14.300 --> 02:36:19.020]  to create division. And then, you know, you don't want government health care. So you're a,
[02:36:19.020 --> 02:36:25.020]  you're a cracker. You know, Chris Matthews says they're the race pimps. And I know you had to
[02:36:25.020 --> 02:36:29.980]  pull it up on another computer because I was asking you to find the machete article. But I'm
[02:36:29.980 --> 02:36:35.740]  going to dig that up and relink to it up at info wars.com this afternoon from America Patrol.com
[02:36:35.740 --> 02:36:41.260]  the September 8th, 2010. Remember hearing about the riots, but not that it was machete related
[02:36:41.260 --> 02:36:46.220]  or folks have machetes, but I know that you've done the research on that. So I look forward to
[02:36:46.220 --> 02:36:50.140]  getting that out to people. Glenn Spencer, thank you for joining us. We appreciate the time. Thank
[02:36:50.140 --> 02:36:55.260]  you. All right. There he goes. Ladies and gentlemen, and I want to get into Tunisia forces, fight
[02:36:55.260 --> 02:37:02.060]  presidential guards near the palace. And I really respect his analysis. I want to get Webster Tarpley's
[02:37:02.060 --> 02:37:09.500]  take on this because he's written an article that's at Tarpley.net and also an info wars.com
[02:37:09.500 --> 02:37:19.740]  Tunisian WikiLeaks, Putsch, CIA touts, Mediterranean tsunami of coups. And Tarpley and others have
[02:37:19.740 --> 02:37:27.100]  said that WikiLeaks is just a CIA slash Israeli slash British Intel front and that they would
[02:37:27.100 --> 02:37:30.940]  start going out for financial institutions. Madsen and others said that almost a year ago.
[02:37:30.940 --> 02:37:34.460]  Now they are starting to do it. But then if you don't support Assange,
[02:37:34.460 --> 02:37:39.100]  then you set the precedent to not support the First Amendment. They set these traps. So I do
[02:37:39.100 --> 02:37:44.620]  support Assange not going to prison while I do agree with our resident scholars who think it's
[02:37:44.620 --> 02:37:48.860]  suspicious. But Tarpley, I got to ask you, what's going on with Chris Matthews? If you haven't seen
[02:37:48.860 --> 02:37:53.260]  it, I'll play it. Now saying if you don't support government death panels, government health care,
[02:37:53.260 --> 02:38:00.860]  you are a white cracker. They're now openly invoking that whites are scum, trying to legitimize
[02:38:00.860 --> 02:38:08.540]  racial conflict. The Ford Foundation funding the people like Obama's pastor Wright with the white
[02:38:08.540 --> 02:38:14.620]  devil stuff. The Ford Foundation funding the LaRica and Kista movement. I mean, how do you respond to
[02:38:14.620 --> 02:38:18.300]  this? I mean, we need to get the people together against the big global bankers, but they want
[02:38:18.300 --> 02:38:24.300]  us all fighting over stupid racial stuff. Well, Alex, these are the foundation funded provocateurs
[02:38:24.300 --> 02:38:29.660]  and the guy that you've been quoting and the one that was quoted before, right? These are
[02:38:29.660 --> 02:38:36.220]  people who get money from foundations to go out and say these stupid incendiary things. So in
[02:38:36.220 --> 02:38:42.460]  fact, the foundations are fomenting racism and attempting to use it as a classic divide and
[02:38:42.460 --> 02:38:47.740]  conquer strategy. So you don't get a united front of the whole people against Wall Street
[02:38:47.740 --> 02:38:54.220]  and the zombie bankers, but you get this kind of crazy quilt of ethnicities and everybody's
[02:38:54.220 --> 02:38:59.740]  squabbling. It's actually this is the model that was used by the Austro-Hungarian Empire in its
[02:38:59.740 --> 02:39:06.540]  last phase, right? To try to promote and to and to foster the differentiation of the nationalities
[02:39:06.540 --> 02:39:12.540]  so that they would they would all be squabbling. And they do it in the name of unity, but then
[02:39:12.540 --> 02:39:16.780]  create the disunity and they must be getting desperate when we learn that Rupert Murdoch
[02:39:16.780 --> 02:39:23.020]  was in a bidding war with the Weinsteins and one wanting to produce machete Fox television,
[02:39:23.020 --> 02:39:28.380]  Rupert Murdoch. That's why when a Fox writer wrote about it, they pulled the article,
[02:39:28.380 --> 02:39:32.460]  they don't want folks to know that they're funding this duplicitous division.
[02:39:33.260 --> 02:39:40.300]  Right. We know from the solving, the cracking of the human genome back in the year 2000,
[02:39:40.300 --> 02:39:45.500]  when Jake Craig Bender went to the White House and was received by Clinton, he officially informed
[02:39:45.500 --> 02:39:52.220]  Clinton that race does not exist. From a genetic point of view, there is no such thing as race.
[02:39:52.220 --> 02:39:59.100]  This is a complete fraud from that point of view. Now, obviously, there are racial problems and
[02:39:59.100 --> 02:40:04.700]  you need to have an approach to dealing with the fact that if you're black, you have a much higher
[02:40:04.700 --> 02:40:09.660]  probability of being unemployed. But that's not what these these foundation characters are into.
[02:40:09.660 --> 02:40:15.020]  They're into something quite different. I wouldn't give them any extra credence. I mean,
[02:40:15.020 --> 02:40:21.260]  anybody who says the last gasp of white America, this is simply ridiculous. It's simply who believes
[02:40:21.260 --> 02:40:26.140]  it. That's not social reality. That has nothing to do with anything. That's just a line he was
[02:40:26.140 --> 02:40:32.780]  given by a foundation to go out and mow that and then collect his foundation's stipend. So,
[02:40:32.780 --> 02:40:41.340]  enough of them. Well, that is what's going on, no doubt. Briefly, what's your take on the Tucson
[02:40:41.340 --> 02:40:50.300]  shooter? I mean, a pharma key at constant hallucinogens. Bush, he's a man for all seasons.
[02:40:50.300 --> 02:40:55.020]  They can demonize the left, the right. Now he wants the lawyer that was the Unabomber's lawyer.
[02:40:55.020 --> 02:41:01.820]  We know Kaczynski was involved in MKUltra. That's the LA Times. I mean, this guy for me really
[02:41:01.820 --> 02:41:08.140]  fits the mold of a Manchurian program. Tell me if you think I'm wrong. No, I think that's very
[02:41:08.140 --> 02:41:13.180]  likely. And of course, we have this fact that the immediate reports said that there were three
[02:41:13.180 --> 02:41:17.740]  individuals that was later reduced to two. And then they claim that one of them was just the
[02:41:17.740 --> 02:41:23.740]  taxi driver, so he didn't count. So then it went down to one. And that's the guy that you're left
[02:41:23.740 --> 02:41:28.780]  with. I would recommend the following. Rather than looking at the details of the individual case,
[02:41:28.780 --> 02:41:35.340]  let's look at this pattern that we've had in the first two weeks of the new year. Because the
[02:41:35.340 --> 02:41:39.180]  pattern, once you've established that, that really has objective reality beyond all the
[02:41:39.980 --> 02:41:47.660]  little details of each one of them. On December 31st, we had a guy by the name of Walker
[02:41:47.660 --> 02:41:54.300]  who was found in a dumpster in a landfill in Delaware near Wilmington. And it turns out that
[02:41:54.300 --> 02:42:01.260]  this is somebody who was a top advisor to the secretary of the Air Force and the Air Force Chief
[02:42:01.260 --> 02:42:05.420]  of Staff. The head of Amtrak on the East Coast, the head of Mothers Against Drunk Driving,
[02:42:05.420 --> 02:42:09.980]  the head of the Vietnam Veteran Fund. This guy was super high-powered behind the scenes.
[02:42:09.980 --> 02:42:14.780]  Right. But I think among other things, the relevancy is that he was involved in the
[02:42:14.780 --> 02:42:19.900]  Air Force chain of command at the time that we had the hijacking of the Rogue B-52. Remember,
[02:42:19.900 --> 02:42:25.180]  in late August, September 2007, a fully loaded B-52 intercontinental bomber with
[02:42:25.180 --> 02:42:31.340]  six nuclear-tipped cruise missiles on board was essentially hijacked by the Rogue network,
[02:42:31.340 --> 02:42:36.700]  by the group speaking at that time through Cheney, now having other spokespersons we would have to
[02:42:36.700 --> 02:42:41.900]  assume. And that was essentially taken to Barksdale, Louisiana, from North Dakota, ready to go to
[02:42:41.900 --> 02:42:48.700]  the Middle East and then stopped on the runway. And he was admittedly the top servant of Bush and
[02:42:48.700 --> 02:42:52.860]  Cheney going back to the previous administration. I mean, this was their go-to guy. It's a very
[02:42:52.860 --> 02:42:56.940]  important, very important thing. And then, of course, we have the... I don't know if I have the
[02:42:56.940 --> 02:43:02.780]  order exactly right, but then you have the... There was about to be a big merger, and then the head
[02:43:02.780 --> 02:43:07.740]  person over the merger burned up in her car in her front yard. That's right. This is the Ashley
[02:43:07.740 --> 02:43:14.060]  Turton case. Now, this lady was a lobbyist, but she was married to a top official of the
[02:43:14.060 --> 02:43:21.340]  Obama White House. And his function was to be the liaison of the Obama White House with the
[02:43:21.340 --> 02:43:27.180]  House of Representatives. So this chills that entire scene. And it's very, very mysterious,
[02:43:27.180 --> 02:43:34.540]  because she's backing her BMW out of her garage on Capitol Hill, and the car starts burning.
[02:43:34.540 --> 02:43:39.820]  And the police come up with lame stories about, well, this must have been a low-speed collision
[02:43:39.820 --> 02:43:44.460]  with inflammable material. Well, I've seen the photo. It's clearly an incendiary car bomb. They
[02:43:44.460 --> 02:43:48.940]  blew her... The car's just completely destroyed. They murdered her. That's the strong... The strong...
[02:43:48.940 --> 02:43:53.100]  What are they gonna do? Blow my car up? And then they say it just caught on fire? That's like saying
[02:43:53.100 --> 02:43:58.460]  Benazar Budo hit her head. Right. So that bears a death. Now, that goes together with the death
[02:43:58.460 --> 02:44:03.740]  of the congressional aide and the shooting of the congresswoman. And in Arizona, days before,
[02:44:03.740 --> 02:44:12.140]  the former head guy for the Senate, the headstaffer of the Arizona Senate, he gets killed execution
[02:44:12.140 --> 02:44:16.700]  style. There's a bunch of these deaths going on. What's happening? Well, there's more. We also have
[02:44:16.700 --> 02:44:22.620]  here in Maryland, we have a series of incendiary letters delivered to Governor Martin O'Malley
[02:44:22.620 --> 02:44:26.220]  and also to the head of the Department of Transportation... Mr. Napolitano got one.
[02:44:26.220 --> 02:44:31.660]  The state of Maryland. Now, you look at that at O'Malley, what is notable about O'Malley,
[02:44:31.660 --> 02:44:36.300]  a number of things. I mean, he's one of the few Democratic governors who did a really good
[02:44:36.300 --> 02:44:41.340]  election victory in getting himself a second term. But this is somebody who had taken the lead
[02:44:41.340 --> 02:44:46.780]  in attacking fraud closures. He had written a letter to the Maryland state judiciary saying,
[02:44:46.780 --> 02:44:52.700]  I want you to slow down on these fraud closures by zombie bankers against our citizens until
[02:44:52.700 --> 02:44:58.300]  we're sure that the paperwork is absolutely impeccable, that there's no fraud, there are no
[02:44:58.300 --> 02:45:04.700]  robo-signers, no perjury in the documents, no dead people signing the complaint and all the rest
[02:45:04.700 --> 02:45:10.460]  of this stuff, as we've seen. So there's then that one. Then I would also look at Tom Hammer
[02:45:10.460 --> 02:45:17.420]  Delay. It's certainly a little bit of a draconian sentence for him comparatively to what he was,
[02:45:17.420 --> 02:45:21.740]  right? Normally, once you're the majority leader in the House, you're not going to be subjected
[02:45:21.740 --> 02:45:27.100]  to this kind of treatment in the oligarchical system that we have. But the parapetia, as the
[02:45:27.100 --> 02:45:33.900]  Greeks would have put it, right? The fall of Delay from essentially the legislative dictator of
[02:45:33.900 --> 02:45:39.500]  Capitol Hill for two or three years down to now being somebody on his way to jail. So they give
[02:45:39.500 --> 02:45:43.820]  him three years in jail. They say, you're going to jail immediately, go directly to jail. They're
[02:45:43.820 --> 02:45:49.420]  not past go. And we've got another five-year sentence told that we're going to hold that over
[02:45:49.420 --> 02:45:54.620]  your head. And otherwise, we're going to give you 10 years of community service. So I think this
[02:45:54.620 --> 02:45:59.900]  was also calculated to send a message. In other words, when you put delay in jail, you're saying
[02:45:59.900 --> 02:46:05.660]  to Boehner and Cantor and the rest of these Republicans who are coming in, essentially
[02:46:05.660 --> 02:46:10.460]  watch out, boys, because we can put any of you in jail. And I think the basic idea of all of
[02:46:10.460 --> 02:46:16.380]  these incidents, right, being at the Walker, the Maryland, the Turton, the Tucson, the Delay,
[02:46:16.380 --> 02:46:22.620]  I think it's five or six of these cases, you can see that there's an attempt to discipline,
[02:46:22.620 --> 02:46:27.740]  first of all, the hundred or so new Congress persons coming to town. A lot of these are Republicans.
[02:46:28.380 --> 02:46:34.060]  They're trying to scare them. But I mean, look at the Walker guy, this top advisor,
[02:46:34.060 --> 02:46:38.620]  he's running around to shovel without a shoe for two days. Then he's found dead,
[02:46:39.180 --> 02:46:44.860]  murdered, dumped in a landfill. He's found in a trash can that's then put a garbage truck and
[02:46:44.860 --> 02:46:50.540]  taken and dumped. And then the police announced he was planting bombs at his neighbor's house.
[02:46:50.540 --> 02:46:56.620]  So they're also discrediting the dead man. I mean, obviously, this is a message. The day
[02:46:56.620 --> 02:47:01.900]  that the big merger is happening that she's involved in, her car blows up. I mean, is this
[02:47:01.900 --> 02:47:06.220]  the beginning of Night of the Long Knives or something? No, it's simply the disciplining
[02:47:06.220 --> 02:47:11.420]  of these people. In other words, they've all got to be reminded who is boss. Now, the program
[02:47:11.420 --> 02:47:17.260]  of the rogue network is essentially the George Schultz program. It's tax cuts for the rich,
[02:47:17.260 --> 02:47:22.300]  which got the domestic discretionary spending starting with unemployment benefits,
[02:47:22.300 --> 02:47:26.700]  cut and got social security, Medicare, Medicaid, destroy the social safety net,
[02:47:26.700 --> 02:47:32.300]  and complete deregulation. They also want to have the debt limit passed. They want these
[02:47:32.300 --> 02:47:39.100]  Tea Party people to shut up basically. There's a complicated issue because in many ways,
[02:47:39.100 --> 02:47:45.740]  it is a disaster to try to not raise the debt limit. But the Wall Street people want it done
[02:47:45.740 --> 02:47:52.380]  their way. So what they're saying is, we're now going to have the Obama State of the Union within
[02:47:52.380 --> 02:47:59.500]  10 days. It's widely assumed that Obama will do one of two things. He will either start the general
[02:47:59.500 --> 02:48:05.340]  assault on social security, attempting to strip the American people of one of their most basic
[02:48:05.340 --> 02:48:10.460]  economic rights. That's one possible trip for Obama. In other words, let's have a centrist
[02:48:10.460 --> 02:48:16.460]  coalition under the aegis of Obama. Now that we've demonized the left extreme and the right
[02:48:16.460 --> 02:48:21.340]  extreme, everybody's got to huddle together in the center and take part in this centrist coalition.
[02:48:21.340 --> 02:48:28.780]  The program of that is destroy social security. Or, if that's not feasible or doesn't cut the
[02:48:28.780 --> 02:48:34.140]  mustard, then there's also the idea of tax reform. What they mean by tax reform, I think,
[02:48:34.140 --> 02:48:40.860]  is very likely to be this 23, 24 percent national sales tax, right? Value added tax.
[02:48:40.860 --> 02:48:48.220]  Which they've turned into some type of sugar goodie for conservatives. It's going to be on top
[02:48:48.220 --> 02:48:53.260]  of the income tax. They're just going to rename it the Social Security Tax. Folks, you do not want
[02:48:53.260 --> 02:48:58.700]  this. And by the way, the Bush aide was John Wheeler. I don't know why we got the name wrong.
[02:48:58.700 --> 02:49:04.300]  But again, they're admitting that was a murder, Bob, but then mixing in some other things. Please
[02:49:04.300 --> 02:49:10.140]  continue, Webster. Well, that, I think, is the pattern. So you get the idea that they're saying
[02:49:10.860 --> 02:49:15.820]  you're not allowed to be an extremist of the left or the right. You've got to essentially go with the
[02:49:16.620 --> 02:49:23.260]  immediate mainstream. And that was the message signaling the new Congress was, and Republican
[02:49:23.260 --> 02:49:29.740]  senators, yes, the shooting. We must all lower our tone. The American people need to not be upset
[02:49:29.740 --> 02:49:36.140]  and sit down and shut up. It is all your guilt collectively, regardless of who was behind this.
[02:49:36.140 --> 02:49:42.700]  It's now time to crack down on free speech, talk radio, internet IDs. It's now time to do this for
[02:49:42.700 --> 02:49:49.420]  the good of America. Right. And of course, it's the national interest that they're putting forward
[02:49:49.420 --> 02:49:57.420]  is no national interest at all, but purely a Wall Street interest. So that's the moment. Now,
[02:49:57.420 --> 02:50:03.020]  obviously, this can't last. I mean, the kind of consensus that you can that you can jewelry rig
[02:50:03.020 --> 02:50:08.780]  with these with these various terror events and judicial intimidation and other things,
[02:50:08.780 --> 02:50:12.460]  that won't last, but they don't need it to last. All they need to do is to ram through
[02:50:13.180 --> 02:50:18.540]  a series of things in the next three, four months. Again, I think cutting up social security is
[02:50:18.540 --> 02:50:24.380]  probably their main target, but they would also accept this other, the other version,
[02:50:24.380 --> 02:50:30.140]  right, which would be the value-added tax. So that's what I see behind this pattern.
[02:50:30.140 --> 02:50:36.540]  And it's unfortunate that people have learned very little, right? When these events occur,
[02:50:36.540 --> 02:50:44.220]  you cannot begin sociological analysis of what it means as if these were spontaneous events,
[02:50:44.220 --> 02:50:51.900]  because they are not. These are orchestrated events, right? We don't know where the shrink is
[02:50:51.900 --> 02:50:56.860]  in Lochner's life, right? The mental health professional. Yeah, stay there. I also want to
[02:50:56.860 --> 02:51:00.700]  get into Tunisia. We're going to go into overdrive. I've got some other important news.
[02:51:01.660 --> 02:51:05.420]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:05.420 --> 02:51:10.460]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days. It's
[02:51:10.460 --> 02:51:15.740]  called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works. For all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection
[02:51:15.740 --> 02:51:21.660]  lawsuits. When I first joined, I was being sued. So I used the program methods, and after filing
[02:51:21.660 --> 02:51:27.020]  one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed. With Zero Debt in 90 Days, your success
[02:51:27.020 --> 02:51:31.820]  is guaranteed in writing. There is no other program of its kind. Don't be along when creditors gang
[02:51:31.820 --> 02:51:36.220]  up on you. Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in
[02:51:36.220 --> 02:51:41.500]  only 90 days, guaranteed, prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our

[02:52:05.820 --> 02:52:11.660]  a new world order based upon collective action. Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the
[02:52:11.660 --> 02:52:17.020]  globalist through their own words and documents. The new world order really is a tool for addressing
[02:52:17.020 --> 02:52:22.540]  a new world of possibilities. It means all the world under their control. The United Nations would
[02:52:22.540 --> 02:52:28.700]  take over America. The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world. Invisible Empire chronicles
[02:52:28.700 --> 02:52:33.740]  how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive
[02:52:33.740 --> 02:52:38.780]  world government. I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution
[02:52:38.780 --> 02:52:43.420]  for the global financial system. Global governance with the establishment of a G20. So it's going
[02:52:43.420 --> 02:52:49.180]  to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[02:53:32.300 --> 02:53:37.500]  stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986,
[02:53:37.500 --> 02:53:41.980]  yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is out
[02:53:41.980 --> 02:53:46.620]  to perform paper investments, yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your
[02:53:46.620 --> 02:53:55.660]  retirement, call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.

[02:54:19.100 --> 02:54:27.180]  the Tarpster, Webster, Griffin, Tarpley. We're going into Tunisia. Also, I found it on a bunch of sites.
[02:54:27.180 --> 02:54:34.220]  Westlake Unrest dubbed LA Machete Riots by Immigration Restriction Group, and I've got some
[02:54:34.220 --> 02:54:38.940]  other articles here. So, there were machete attacks and police having to shoot people
[02:54:40.780 --> 02:54:45.260]  piling right out of the movie theater. So, I guess my prediction did come true, unfortunately.
[02:54:45.260 --> 02:54:52.780]  We're going back to Webster for him to finish up with his take on the G-string Grim Reaper
[02:54:54.140 --> 02:55:00.140]  shooting, the Jared Lee Lofner situation. Before we go any further, though, I want to thank
[02:55:00.140 --> 02:55:05.900]  Diamond Gusset Jeans. Diamond Gusset is running some of the great specials right now. They are a

[02:55:50.860 --> 02:55:55.180]  They've recently created an eye-opening video that you can see at End of America, the number 3.com
[02:55:55.180 --> 02:56:00.380]  for free, detailing their biggest and most important prediction yet. Check out their video with
[02:56:00.380 --> 02:56:05.660]  End of America, the number 3.com, End of America, number 3.com. In fact, Webster, next hour after
[02:56:05.660 --> 02:56:14.140]  we hit Tunisia, I want to spend a little time on Chinese President coming out and saying,
[02:56:14.140 --> 02:56:19.100]  yes, the dollar is going to be phased out. The Chinese currency will be the New World Reserve
[02:56:19.100 --> 02:56:24.300]  currency. And he says, you know, America needs to just go along with this. So I'm going to get
[02:56:24.300 --> 02:56:29.260]  your take on that. But briefly, in a few minutes, we've got left here in the third hour. Webster,
[02:56:29.260 --> 02:56:34.700]  you were during the break trying to get into, don't just try to analyze an event without looking at
[02:56:34.700 --> 02:56:40.060]  the context of it and the other signs. Go ahead. In other words, the old saying used to be
[02:56:41.500 --> 02:56:47.820]  terrorism is a sociological phenomenon in the sense that it's organized by sociologists. And I
[02:56:47.820 --> 02:56:55.260]  guess today we have to add, after Cho and Hassan and others, we'd have to say terrorism is a
[02:56:55.260 --> 02:57:01.020]  psychological phenomenon. It's organized by psychiatrists and psychologists of a certain
[02:57:01.020 --> 02:57:08.620]  kind. In other words, you cannot attempt to analyze each of these individual cases and saying, well,
[02:57:08.620 --> 02:57:14.140]  sociologically, what does this mean? What does this tell us about society or political discourse
[02:57:14.140 --> 02:57:20.620]  or whatever other nonsense? The point is that most, the vast majority of these events are
[02:57:20.620 --> 02:57:26.780]  simply not spontaneous. They can't be explained in terms of the sociology of the moment. But
[02:57:26.780 --> 02:57:33.260]  rather, there's a network that produces these events that you generally don't see or you can see
[02:57:33.900 --> 02:57:39.180]  pieces of it at different times if you look carefully. And that's the point. In other words,
[02:57:39.180 --> 02:57:45.260]  the pattern is what you're left with concerning the pattern. The unfortunate lady, Ashley Turton,
[02:57:45.260 --> 02:57:51.580]  who died in this very suspicious fire in her BMW, right? It looks like a bomb placed in the car,
[02:57:51.580 --> 02:57:56.140]  right? Like in the Godfather or whatever. Except in this case, it's an
[02:57:56.140 --> 02:58:03.260]  incendiary bomb. It's not so obvious. She had been the chief of staff of Congresswoman Rosa de
[02:58:03.260 --> 02:58:10.300]  Lauro of Connecticut. The Democrat and de Lauro's husband is Stan Greenberg, who's the business
[02:58:10.300 --> 02:58:18.700]  partner of James Carville and a bunch of other lobbyists and pollsters and political consultants.
[02:58:19.260 --> 02:58:25.420]  And the implication is that the apartment owned by Rosa de Lauro and Stan Greenberg
[02:58:25.420 --> 02:58:33.900]  has been a kind of twisting place for top Democrats. The name mentioned is usually
[02:58:33.900 --> 02:58:41.420]  Rom Emanuel, but others. So, Rom's cleaning up some... Stay there, we'll be right in one minute.
[02:58:41.420 --> 02:58:50.380]  America's number one source for independent top radio for over a decade. We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:50.380 --> 02:58:56.940]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with
[02:58:56.940 --> 02:59:01.500]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[02:59:01.500 --> 02:59:05.820]  of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere
[02:59:05.820 --> 02:59:11.660]  in or on the body. My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:59:12.540 --> 02:59:17.180]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[02:59:17.180 --> 02:59:21.020]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[02:59:21.020 --> 02:59:26.940]  to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas. This includes the eyes,
[02:59:26.940 --> 02:59:32.700]  ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:59:33.260 --> 02:59:36.860]  Be sure to watch our new seven-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System
[02:59:36.860 --> 02:59:42.940]  at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[03:00:13.180 --> 03:00:23.660]  Well, here we are in hour number four. Webster Griffin Tarpley is our guest. I want to get
[03:00:23.660 --> 03:00:29.020]  into the incredible announcements by the Chinese leader ahead of his state visit,
[03:00:29.580 --> 03:00:34.620]  signaling the end of the dollar, saying it's got to not be the World Reserve currency and
[03:00:34.620 --> 03:00:39.420]  saying he wants the Chinese currency to be that. Of course, a few months ago, Russia and China
[03:00:39.420 --> 03:00:45.500]  did start signaling that they were going to engage in trade amongst themselves in a new currency.
[03:00:45.500 --> 03:00:50.300]  Now they've chosen the Chinese currency for that. They're now shelling it on the world market.
[03:00:51.260 --> 03:00:55.580]  So we're going to talk about that with Webster. But right now, Tunisia forces fight presidential
[03:00:55.580 --> 03:01:03.660]  guards near Palace. They've had three presidents in the last 48 hours there. They say WikiLeaks
[03:01:03.660 --> 03:01:08.460]  information on greed of Tunisian president's wife, the Trovenation onto the streets to start a
[03:01:08.460 --> 03:01:17.180]  revolution. You've got a article here today, Tunisian WikiLeaks put CIA touts, Mediterranean
[03:01:17.180 --> 03:01:23.500]  tsunami of coups that are going to be coming. And here's another one, AP, U.S. denies WikiLeaks
[03:01:23.500 --> 03:01:30.860]  spurred revolt in Tunisia. Webster Tarpley. Well, this is a destabilization, right? It's a coup.
[03:01:31.740 --> 03:01:35.420]  And the general word that you're hearing from the State Department and the CIA
[03:01:35.420 --> 03:01:41.900]  here in Washington is that this is now a second generation or a new generation of the CIA people
[03:01:41.900 --> 03:01:49.980]  power coup, color revolution or postmodern coup. And it's now the ingredients being the youth
[03:01:49.980 --> 03:01:56.460]  bulge, the fact that such a large portion of the population in the Arab world is under 30,
[03:01:56.460 --> 03:02:06.220]  under 25 even, the vulnerability of these people to Western social media, Facebook, Twitter, Google.
[03:02:06.220 --> 03:02:11.100]  Yeah, they want to get them socialized so they can inject them with the sterilence and things
[03:02:11.100 --> 03:02:16.860]  so they can be trendy and have abortions when they're 10. They think that Twitter and Facebook
[03:02:16.860 --> 03:02:23.740]  are cool. They think the U.S. is cool. But on the other hand, this is now the post-911 generation,
[03:02:23.740 --> 03:02:30.780]  so-called, according to the think tanks of people who don't like the existing regimes,
[03:02:30.780 --> 03:02:39.260]  but they don't like the Islamist sort of ultra-puritan opposition. So you've got that. And then
[03:02:39.260 --> 03:02:45.500]  the big thing to say is that this is not the Jasmine Revolution. This is a hunger revolution.
[03:02:45.500 --> 03:02:50.860]  This is about what Wall Street has done to the world economy that you have a very high
[03:02:50.860 --> 03:02:56.540]  levels of unemployment and especially now with a wave of speculation with derivatives in the
[03:02:56.540 --> 03:03:03.740]  markets. You've got the fuel price, the price for gas, for cooking, for gasoline, for heating oil,
[03:03:03.740 --> 03:03:08.460]  whatever else they need. That's gone sky-high and the basic food groups. Now we're having a
[03:03:08.460 --> 03:03:14.620]  tremendous upward spike in the world food prices that are going on right now. So you take that
[03:03:14.620 --> 03:03:20.700]  economic despair. This is where the Tunisian events are really rooted. It started with a guy with a
[03:03:20.700 --> 03:03:27.500]  vegetable cart in Sidi Bouzid in Tunisia. And along come the police. They harass him. He doesn't
[03:03:27.500 --> 03:03:33.100]  have a permit to have his push cart with vegetables. And he's in such despair that he burns himself.
[03:03:33.100 --> 03:03:39.020]  It sounds like an Italian near-realist movie of 1945 or something like this, right, where the guy
[03:03:39.020 --> 03:03:47.020]  is basically driven to the last extremity. So now the attempt then is that you've got to get
[03:03:47.020 --> 03:03:53.580]  the petty Bouzid. The middle class goes into the streets and they of course are not so concerned
[03:03:53.580 --> 03:03:59.660]  about the economic issues. They're concerned more about voting or blogging or free speech.
[03:04:00.460 --> 03:04:07.340]  And with this, the CIA thinks that they can refurbish the model of the color revolution
[03:04:07.340 --> 03:04:13.260]  and the people power coup. You notice that the so-called Twitter revolution in Iran in June of
[03:04:13.260 --> 03:04:21.100]  2009 was a failure. It just plots. It didn't go anywhere, right, with Musavi. The Orange Revolution
[03:04:21.100 --> 03:04:27.260]  in Ukraine has now been completely rolled back. The NATO, IMF agents Yushenko and Tim Oshenko
[03:04:27.260 --> 03:04:33.260]  have been kicked out. The Cedars Revolution in Lebanon did not work. That's an interesting one
[03:04:33.260 --> 03:04:37.980]  because they were stopped by Hezbollah, which happens to be a well-organized force.
[03:04:37.980 --> 03:04:43.980]  Stay there. Let's look at this geopolitically and why the Brzezinski School is pushing for
[03:04:43.980 --> 03:04:47.980]  all of this, this soft power overthrow. And then the other question is,
[03:04:50.140 --> 03:04:54.220]  what type of governments are they wanting to put in? Why are they doing this? What's the motive?
[03:04:54.220 --> 03:04:59.820]  Let's look at the globe and what you see coming up in the next year. They don't want to get into
[03:04:59.820 --> 03:05:04.780]  dollar devaluation. This special announcement is brought to you by Renaissance Charge.
[03:05:04.780 --> 03:05:11.260]  Have you ever wondered if you could make your car run on 100% electric power for free? It is now

[03:05:16.540 --> 03:05:21.740]  at the same time? What if this could also be used to restore useless batteries and save you
[03:05:21.740 --> 03:05:26.860]  lots of money? Because our customers asked for it, we have organized a Renaissance Charge Conference
[03:05:26.860 --> 03:05:32.860]  workshop on July 29th to July 31st at the beautiful Courtais Lane Resort in Idaho. Not only will you

[03:08:20.700 --> 03:08:26.940]  Griffin Tarpley is our guest and we're covering the Tunisian situation which Tarpley has written
[03:08:26.940 --> 03:08:33.740]  a detailed article available at infowars.com saying that it's a CIA Mediterranean tsunami of
[03:08:33.740 --> 03:08:40.860]  coups and we do see some media bragging about this while still also denying to the general public.
[03:08:40.860 --> 03:08:45.100]  Kind of like we knew back in September that Israel and the U.S. had made the Stuxnet worm
[03:08:45.100 --> 03:08:50.940]  to be used on Iran. Now on Saturday they bragged in the New York Times that indeed Israel tested
[03:08:50.940 --> 03:08:57.900]  it and developed it with the U.S. at the Timonam facility in Israel. Now confirmed Stuxnet was
[03:08:57.900 --> 03:09:03.100]  false flag launched by Israel and U.S. by false flag. They're touting it as a reason to take over
[03:09:03.100 --> 03:09:10.940]  Internet freedom because someone created Stuxnet. They created it. So amazing. So geopolitically,
[03:09:10.940 --> 03:09:17.500]  undoubtedly they are manipulating and using the Twitter type system which we know is State
[03:09:17.500 --> 03:09:24.700]  Department backed which runs the CIA to do this. But why do they not want who is in power in Tunisia?
[03:09:24.700 --> 03:09:29.820]  A lot of times they like Arab dictators. They like corrupt oppressive states. I guess Tunisia
[03:09:29.820 --> 03:09:37.340]  wasn't playing ball properly with them. And what's the goal with all these synthetic
[03:09:37.340 --> 03:09:43.580]  people power situations going on? I think the goal is to use Tunisia as a kind of pilot project
[03:09:43.580 --> 03:09:48.700]  and get a wave going. And what they're looking at, for example, is Ben Ali in Tunisia had been in
[03:09:48.700 --> 03:09:55.500]  power for 23 years. That's nothing. Mubarak in Egypt has been in power for 30 years. The Assad
[03:09:55.500 --> 03:10:01.900]  dynasty in Syria has been in power for 30 years. And Gaddafi in Libya has been in power for about
[03:10:01.900 --> 03:10:07.660]  40 years or more. Now all of these countries are targeted. The gloating from the CIA is that we can
[03:10:07.660 --> 03:10:14.220]  use WikiLeaks. We can put out stories about Mubarak and Gaddafi, the Hashemite monarchy in Jordan,
[03:10:14.220 --> 03:10:20.220]  another target. We can bring them down because we've got the economic unrest because of the food
[03:10:20.220 --> 03:10:25.580]  prices, the fuel prices, the unemployment, the despair. And then we can come in. We get the
[03:10:25.580 --> 03:10:30.140]  workers going with that and we can get the petty bourgeoisie going with our WikiLeaks.
[03:10:30.140 --> 03:10:34.940]  And then what do they do down the road? Well, here's the idea. The goal of the U.S. and the
[03:10:34.940 --> 03:10:43.100]  Middle East is to assemble a coalition of Arab and Sunni states and play that against Iran,
[03:10:43.100 --> 03:10:49.100]  the Shiites, and the allies of Iran, whatever they may be. So the approach, and this is the
[03:10:49.100 --> 03:10:53.820]  specific Obama-Brijinsky approach. This is no longer the neocons. The neocons would say,
[03:10:53.820 --> 03:10:58.300]  bomb everybody to kingdom come. Well, you can't do that anymore. It's too weak. So now you've
[03:10:58.300 --> 03:11:05.500]  got to try to assemble this coalition. And you can see one of the key parts is the Israelis
[03:11:05.500 --> 03:11:09.580]  are putting out calls to the Arabs saying, you've got to join us against Iran because they want to
[03:11:09.580 --> 03:11:15.580]  get Israel into that group, too. The point is that when you've got regimes like Ben Ali after
[03:11:15.580 --> 03:11:22.780]  23 years, Tunisia is not the key militarily, but it's a very interesting country. Egypt, Syria,
[03:11:22.780 --> 03:11:29.900]  Lebanon, Libya, sorry. They all have, again, these sort of entrenched, sclerotic, really
[03:11:29.900 --> 03:11:35.660]  conservative governments that are not interested in wars. They're interested in the status quo. If
[03:11:35.660 --> 03:11:40.940]  anything, they want the U.S. to fight the war, right? They'd rather have the neocon approach. So
[03:11:40.940 --> 03:11:47.260]  the idea is to try to overthrow these people. And instead of getting an entrenched immobile regime,
[03:11:47.260 --> 03:11:54.460]  you get some unstable demagogue who's going to be much easier to get going into some kind of regional
[03:11:54.460 --> 03:12:01.180]  war against Iran. You also want to play them against China and Russia, a couple of examples,
[03:12:01.180 --> 03:12:07.900]  right? We know that in the Iranian color revolution of the summer of 2009, this Musavi,
[03:12:08.780 --> 03:12:15.420]  if he had taken power, he was going to cut off all oil deliveries to China. That would be a great
[03:12:15.420 --> 03:12:21.900]  thing. The U.S. would be delighted to have this in, for example, Syria. If you had a color revolution
[03:12:21.900 --> 03:12:28.540]  in Syria, assisted by WikiLeaks and the economic situation, the Russians had this naval base in
[03:12:28.540 --> 03:12:33.820]  Tartus, Syria. And the NATO planners are very worried about what this means for the Mediterranean.
[03:12:33.820 --> 03:12:39.420]  If you overthrew the Assad dynasty in Syria, the very least you could hope to get would be
[03:12:39.420 --> 03:12:46.540]  kicking the Russians out of Syria. So again, play the Arabs against Iran, China, Russia. And
[03:12:46.540 --> 03:12:52.540]  that's the key to the entire thing. Notice also, Sudan being carved in two because the Chinese
[03:12:52.540 --> 03:12:58.060]  are getting oil from the wells in southern Sudan. So at this point, the U.S. and the British put
[03:12:58.060 --> 03:13:04.300]  on the big push to have Sudan carved into two parts in the same way that Iraq is essentially
[03:13:04.300 --> 03:13:09.980]  carved into three parts. This is the Bernard Lewis plan that sort of brought up to date.
[03:13:09.980 --> 03:13:14.940]  So it's a general assault on the Arab countries. Now behind all this, as you're saying, the weakness
[03:13:14.940 --> 03:13:21.740]  of the dollar. Concerning the dollar, I would say we have a dangerous situation in the sense
[03:13:21.740 --> 03:13:29.660]  that the dollar is slowly losing its ability to function as the world reserve currency,
[03:13:29.660 --> 03:13:35.500]  but there is no alternative. Let me stop you there because I want to segue into that by
[03:13:35.500 --> 03:13:42.380]  documenting this for radio listeners and prisonplanet.tv viewers. As you know, on Sunday morning,
[03:13:42.380 --> 03:13:49.820]  yesterday, Hu Jintao called for a currency system, the current currency system, a product of the
[03:13:49.820 --> 03:13:55.100]  past. He went on to say that the dollar cannot be the world reserve currency anymore and called
[03:13:55.100 --> 03:14:03.340]  for the Chinese currency to replace it ahead of a state visit that starts on Wednesday. Here's
[03:14:03.340 --> 03:14:09.980]  another headline. Who highlights need for U.S.-China cooperation questions the dollar?
[03:14:09.980 --> 03:14:15.740]  He went on to say that we would all stand again from a sound China-U.S. relationship
[03:14:15.740 --> 03:14:22.620]  and lose from confrontation. And that continues there. Here's the Financial Times of London.
[03:14:22.620 --> 03:14:27.580]  Who questions future role of U.S. dollar? This on the heels in the last month or so
[03:14:28.460 --> 03:14:36.540]  of China and Russia starting to engage in trade using Chinese currency. And then you've got Wayne
[03:14:36.540 --> 03:14:40.860]  Madsen and others saying that that was a Chinese missile test off the coast. By the way, what's
[03:14:40.860 --> 03:14:46.060]  your view on that, Webster? There are two competing stories. One is that the U.S. trying to scare
[03:14:46.060 --> 03:14:50.460]  China. There's another story. It's China trying to scare the U.S. I don't know. It just shows that
[03:14:50.460 --> 03:14:56.140]  the tensions are rising. And now they're sending in more Chinese troops into North Korea. This is
[03:14:56.140 --> 03:15:01.100]  the first time in 16 years. On this reserve currency issue though, you have to understand what
[03:15:01.100 --> 03:15:05.660]  does it take to be a reserve currency and who has this wherewithal? Right now it's the U.S.
[03:15:05.660 --> 03:15:10.060]  and nobody else. If you want to be a reserve currency, that means that world central banks
[03:15:10.060 --> 03:15:15.580]  keep their reserves in your currency. And therefore you've got to have something like the U.S.
[03:15:15.580 --> 03:15:22.700]  treasury bill, treasury bond market, which is very broad and very deep and very liquid
[03:15:22.700 --> 03:15:28.540]  with a turnover of about a trillion dollars. One trillion U.S. dollars a day go in and out much,
[03:15:28.540 --> 03:15:34.060]  much more than the stock market and the other things that the people look at. And if you want
[03:15:34.060 --> 03:15:39.820]  to have a reserve currency, you've got to be able to say, I've got a treasury market that is so
[03:15:39.820 --> 03:15:46.540]  well developed on the U.S. model that you can put in basically any amount of securities and get cash
[03:15:46.540 --> 03:15:53.020]  back the same day. Now, nobody comes close. The U.S. market goes back to Alexander Hamilton and the
[03:15:53.020 --> 03:15:59.340]  funded national debt. It goes back to Lincoln. It goes back to... It's a whole process of building
[03:15:59.340 --> 03:16:05.820]  this up. Now, I would warn people, if you mess with the borrowing, if you drive the United States
[03:16:05.820 --> 03:16:10.220]  into default, you're going to destroy that treasury market and that's going to be a world
[03:16:10.220 --> 03:16:15.260]  catastrophe. That will mean that there'll be no world reserve currency of any kind because the
[03:16:15.260 --> 03:16:20.940]  Chinese don't have this. The Chinese are just now taking the first timid steps in making the
[03:16:20.940 --> 03:16:26.300]  renminbi tradable internationally. I mean, it's a tiny fraction. But they are making the right
[03:16:26.300 --> 03:16:30.780]  decisions on investing in infrastructure. Yeah, that's what they're doing. Now they're talking
[03:16:30.780 --> 03:16:36.460]  about financing speed trains in the U.S. Absolutely. Because the United States elites, you know,
[03:16:36.460 --> 03:16:41.580]  cannot invest in anything. It's all completely predatory. But where do you... I mean, obviously,
[03:16:41.580 --> 03:16:46.460]  they're sending in troops for the first time in 16 years into North Korea, the Chinese are. Where do
[03:16:46.460 --> 03:16:51.740]  you... versus where you want to see it go? Where do you see it going? I mean, as there's more and
[03:16:51.740 --> 03:16:57.740]  more announcements of the dollar being phased out. I mean, obviously, folks are mad that the globe
[03:16:57.740 --> 03:17:02.060]  is being flooded with these. And we're already seeing evidence of inflation rearing its head
[03:17:02.060 --> 03:17:08.380]  in commodities across the board from food to oil. That's right. Now, again, nobody, nobody else has
[03:17:08.380 --> 03:17:14.620]  the apparatus to be a reserve currency. Nobody comes close, not Japan, not the Euro. Again,
[03:17:14.620 --> 03:17:18.940]  look at that U.S. Treasury... No, the banking cartel on the SDR, they're transcending nations.
[03:17:18.940 --> 03:17:23.180]  Yeah, but you don't have that U.S. Treasury market. That's something you can't just pull
[03:17:23.180 --> 03:17:27.020]  out of your pocket from one minute to the next. It's a real national asset. It's worth,
[03:17:27.020 --> 03:17:31.740]  it's worth keeping. Now, the response of the U.S. elites, however, to the weakness of the dollar,
[03:17:31.740 --> 03:17:37.740]  right, to the tendency, there is a possibility that central banks will begin to dump their,
[03:17:37.740 --> 03:17:41.820]  you know, at a faster rate, dump their dollar reserves. And they, obviously, they want to avoid
[03:17:41.820 --> 03:17:46.780]  this. Now, that gets us back to the question of the Middle East War. Now, we had a flare-up of
[03:17:46.780 --> 03:17:51.740]  Middle East War danger, I would say, back in July, August, September. I wrote some pretty big
[03:17:51.740 --> 03:17:56.620]  articles about how the U.S. attack on Iran was back on the front burner. In the first
[03:17:56.620 --> 03:18:01.260]  issue of the new year, the London Economist puts on the cover another Middle East war,
[03:18:01.260 --> 03:18:07.980]  oh, no, not again. And the idea is now that this is because Hezbollah and the pro-Iranians
[03:18:07.980 --> 03:18:15.260]  in Lebanon, essentially, have now built up this huge arsenal of rockets, which are not
[03:18:15.260 --> 03:18:21.180]  simply these old World War II-type things, but now we've got some 200-kilometer, 300-kilometer
[03:18:21.180 --> 03:18:26.940]  short-range ballistic missiles with conventional warheads that could be used against the Israeli
[03:18:26.940 --> 03:18:36.540]  airfields in northern Israel. So you could imagine a multi-cornered war with Lebanon, Syria, Iran,
[03:18:36.540 --> 03:18:43.100]  and possibly Hamas from Gaza shooting rockets into Israel. And the Israelis, of course,
[03:18:43.100 --> 03:18:48.380]  retaliating like mad. And who knows where that will lead us. If you were watching Al Jazeera
[03:18:48.380 --> 03:18:54.620]  last night, there was a fairly interesting program about the various kinds of missiles that are now
[03:18:55.260 --> 03:19:01.500]  available. And we know that Hamas has been gone back to shooting rockets in the past couple of
[03:19:01.500 --> 03:19:09.420]  weeks. And in December, there's an example of somebody in Gaza shooting a cornet missile at
[03:19:09.420 --> 03:19:14.460]  an Israeli tank. Now, the cornet looked this up on the Internet. This is an armor-piercing
[03:19:14.460 --> 03:19:22.620]  missile with laser-guided, and it's designed to go through the reactive armor on a modern tank.
[03:19:22.620 --> 03:19:28.220]  This is quite a formidable little piece of armor. Why on earth would the Arabs want to play into
[03:19:28.220 --> 03:19:33.340]  this conflict when it's clear the globalists want it? Webster, we're just out of time. We'll talk to
[03:19:33.340 --> 03:19:39.980]  you again very, very soon. Very informative. As always, tarply.net. We have your latest article
[03:19:39.980 --> 03:19:46.060]  up on infowars.com. We come back. I'm going to get more in and got more into what happened with
[03:19:46.060 --> 03:19:51.180]  the ongoing dollar devaluation and what is unfolding there. But Webster, always great
[03:19:51.180 --> 03:19:55.020]  talking to you. Hope you're having a great new year. All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:19:55.020 --> 03:20:12.300]  retransmission continues. We're going to retransmission now. 20 minutes here into the fourth hour.
