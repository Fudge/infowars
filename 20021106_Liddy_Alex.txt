[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000]  Alright folks, we're here in the final 27 minutes of the State Time Show.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]  We'll be back tonight from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]  And we do have G. Gordon Liddy on the line with us. He has written a new book.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]  I read his book, Will, many years ago and found it to be superb.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]  A new book. When I was a kid this was a free country.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000]  And basically it covers all the issues that we go over on this show.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000]  The B.A.T.F., gun grabbers, the land grabbing, phony environmentalists, all of it.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]  And Mr. Liddy, it's good to have you on the show today, sir.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]  Alex, it's a delight to be with you.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]  I'm glad we could hook up.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000]  Indeed.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]  A great title. When I was a kid this was a free country.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000]  Break down the book for us.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:05.000]  Well, you know, the reason that I wrote the book is because of the remarkable difference in the way this country was when I was a kid.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]  We had all of these freedoms that have been taken away from us one by one, salami tactic,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000]  always in the interest of some, you know, good reason, quote unquote.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]  And the young people don't miss what they never had.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]  And I wanted to show them what it was like when we were really free.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:38.000]  And to get them stirred up enough, I'm hoping, that they will stop this constant erosion of our liberties.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]  Now, G. Gordon Liddy, I mean, certainly you are famous for Watergate
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000]  and you've got a very popular in the top five nationally syndicated radio show,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]  and you've written another best-selling book.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000]  I was always pleased that you have the courage that all these other phony neocon conservative big talk show hosts don't have
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]  to criticize the BATF and for incidents like Ruby Ridge and Waco.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]  Why does that concern G. Gordon Liddy?
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]  Well, because it is a huge abuse of government power.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]  Now, remember, I served in the FBI, and I was very proud to serve in the FBI.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]  And back in the days of the late great J. Edgar Hoover, we never did anything like that.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000]  We did not, first of all, have a, quote, hostage rescue team, end quote.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]  We didn't need a hostage rescue team.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000]  A bunch of out-of-control cowboys whose idea of how to rescue someone is to burn them alive.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]  Well, I read the Delta Force memo that came out in Congress.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]  They didn't want to go on the mission.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]  They said that this is not an arrest situation.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]  We're being sent in to take them out, and they went ahead and ordered them in as well.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000]  Is that a good precedent to have Delta Force Army Special Operations under FBI operating domestically against the American people?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]  No, as a matter of fact, it's against the law.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]  The Posse Comitatus statutes directly forbid that.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000]  And what they did to get around that is they declared this a national security situation.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:21.000]  When you have a bunch of fundamentalist Christians down in rural Texas, and they call them national security problems,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]  that was a phony reason just to involve Delta Force.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000]  And you never want to mix the armed forces and law enforcement together anyway,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]  because the armed forces are not trained for law enforcement.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]  The armed forces are trained, when you see a bad guy, to blow him up or kill him.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]  Armed forces are not trained to go halt federal officer and all that kind of business.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000]  Nor should they be, because you train for what you do.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]  And it's against the law, and it's bad public policy, and all the rest of it.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]  And I was just appalled at what went on down there.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:08.000]  And then Ruby Ridge, here they've got a sniper who boasts that he can put a bullet in a quarter at considerable range,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000]  and he shoots a woman right in the head, and she's holding nothing more dangerous than her baby on her own front porch.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000]  And then Bill Clinton's solicitor general, two and a half years ago, in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000]  argued that the federal officers have a license to kill, even when they're wrong, against innocent people.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]  That was in his brief. You're a lawyer. Does that sound constitutional to you?
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]  No, it certainly does not. Absolutely not.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000]  And this whole business is getting way out of hand.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]  In the first place, those people weren't doing anything down there.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]  And the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms ginned this whole thing up,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000]  notifying the press and everything else so that they would have something spectacular to watch,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]  because they were coming up for their annual appropriations review in Congress,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000]  and they wanted to have something to demonstrate to Congress, you know, that they needed more money.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]  Again, folks, we're talking to...
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]  Well, they did that on the lives of a bunch of innocent women and children.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]  We're talking to G. Gordon Liddy. No need to introduce him.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]  You must know who he is or you probably don't know much.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]  Joining us here today, Mr. Liddy, I saw you a few weeks ago.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]  We got a lot of calls about it.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]  You were on Fox News, one of the only people that had the will to truly stand up as a constitutionalist
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]  and point out that the Patriot Act, which I, by the way, have scanned through all 1,016 sections,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]  is totally un-American.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]  And I just want to point out, at the same time they leave our borders wide open,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]  issue record numbers of visas to Islamic terrorist states and to Russia,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]  but then tell us we need to accept the Patriot Act, the national I.D. card.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]  So your take on the Patriot Act.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]  I think it's way out of line.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000]  It is completely against what the framework of our Constitution wanted,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.000]  and it is something that I think is very dangerous to our civil liberties.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000]  And I'm wholly, totally, and utterly opposed to any kind of internal passport,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]  and that certainly is what it was they were looking for.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]  Now, you served Richard Milhouse Nixon, of course, in his administrations
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000]  and were one of the few that didn't go along with the other little snitches.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]  But at the same time, looking at the Republican Party today,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]  we see Jesse Helms getting replaced with Libby Dole,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]  who said, yeah, go ahead and ban semi-automatic guns, period.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]  We look at this new type of Republican that votes for open borders,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]  signs campaign finance reform, gives nuclear reactors to North Korea.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]  I've really looked at Bush, and other than his rhetoric,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]  his actions seem to be a carbon copy of Bill Clinton.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]  Well, no, I certainly wouldn't think his actions would be a carbon copy of Bill Clinton,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]  especially morally and his sexual morality and everything else.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.000]  To be fair, the reason we've got up to 13 million illegal aliens,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]  most of them from south of the border, milling around in the country
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]  with nobody doing anything about it is the fault of both Republicans and Democrats.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]  Neither party wants to do anything about it for differing reasons.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]  The Democrats don't want to do anything about it
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000]  because they want to grant them all amnesty and register them as Democratic voters.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000]  The Republicans don't want to do anything about it because they want the cheap labor.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000]  And the fact is that it's very bad for the country to have this going on,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]  and the INS is failing to do its job.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]  It's a criminal failure to do their job.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]  I mean, they are deliberately not doing that which they are paid to do,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]  which is to identify these people, round them up, and ship them out.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]  I want to talk about some of the key areas you've hit in your book.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]  It's obviously an excellent book.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]  I now have a copy, and I've read about half of it.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]  But getting back to Bush, because this is important,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000]  he's a big pacifier for conservatives to not stand up for the Constitution.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]  Barbara Boxer says she'll vote to arm all the pilots, but Bush says no.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]  Now, I mean, how do you square that one, G. Gordon Liddy?
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]  I don't, and I think that he's wrong on that issue.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:28.000]  But my understanding of the situation is that if it gets through Congress, Bush will sign it.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]  Absolutely.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]  I don't think he's going to take the political heat to get through Congress.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000]  And, you know, it'll get through Congress on large majorities,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]  and he's not going to waste political capital on that.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]  People are pro-gun.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]  Politicians are winning all the elections pro-Second Amendment.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]  Why wouldn't Bush want to repeal a bunch of these unconstitutional gun laws?
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]  I mean, if we could get a G. Gordon Liddy behind calling for repeal of gun laws,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]  we could probably get that done, sir.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]  Well, I certainly am for repeal.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:11.000]  My own view is that, with the possible exception of prohibiting felons from having firearms,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000]  I don't think that there is a constitutional gun control law in the country.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]  I mean, the Second Amendment is very clear.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000]  And one of the problems that we have is that people are no longer educated in the English language.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]  They don't parse sentences in school anymore.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]  They don't diagram sentences and so forth.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]  If they did, which is what we used to do when I was a kid,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000]  you would know that the words, the...
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]  The right of the people to keep their arms shall not be infringed.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]  No, no, no. The first part.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:54.000]  The first part, which says that a well-regulated militia being necessary for the security of a free state.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]  That is simply a present participle.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]  It's a statement of fact.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]  And it's an adjective.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]  It in no way modifies the meaning of the second part,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000]  which is the right of the people to keep their arms shall not be infringed.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:17.000]  And if you look at all the founding fathers' statements about it, it was quite clear what they meant.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000]  These people who are saying that the militia reference means the state or national guard,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]  obviously can't read either,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000]  because if you look at Title 10 in the current U.S. Code, which defines the militia,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]  it's all able-bodied males.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]  And now, of course, it would be all able-bodied people,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]  because of political correctness,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]  between the ages of 17 and 45.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000]  And the last I heard, all people between 17 and 45 are not members of either the state or national guard.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]  Well, then they try to claim that professor up in Chicago is now getting kicked out of his college
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]  for saying the founding fathers were actually anti-gun.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]  The globalists and their minions just lie.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]  That's the problem.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]  You're speaking about a man named Belisles,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:12.000]  who wrote a book that said that, in effect, the colonials had very few weapons,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]  and the frontiersmen had very few weapons.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000]  And he falsified his data and was caught at it.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000]  And his college, where he had tenure, had three top scholars,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]  I think one from Princeton, one from Harvard, one from Yale,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]  form a committee to examine his work,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000]  and they found it unsatisfactory, falsification, and everything else,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]  and said he was fired.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]  But he still hasn't had that big reward revoked.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000]  Saying that the people of America and colonial America weren't obsessed with guns
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]  is like saying that sailing ships didn't have sails.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]  Well, they weren't obsessed with guns.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]  A gun was a gun to those people.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]  Well, you had to have it.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]  It was like an axe.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]  You had to have it.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]  I mean, it was a tool.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]  It was a regular, ordinary, everyday tool.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]  They used them to hunt with.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000]  They used them for security against marauders and Indians and the rest of it.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000]  And, of course, the real reason for the Second Amendment
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000]  was because we had just thrown off a tyrannical government, that of George III,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]  and the framers wanted the people to have the means,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]  should the government become tyrannical again,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]  to be able to throw it off again.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]  All right.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]  We're talking to G. Gordon Letty, bestselling author,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]  syndicate of talk show hosts,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:39.000]  obviously the leader of what we saw happen there at the Watergate Hotel.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]  Now, let's go back to the Patriot Act, because your book talks about that,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000]  and your book gets into the whole police state manipulation.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]  I've read the Patriot Act.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000]  The whole thing has to do with taking our rights away,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]  and it has nothing to do with protecting the American people.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000]  How do we repeal the Patriot Act, or what is G. Gordon Letty calling for?
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]  What's the course you want?
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]  Well, we've already gotten rid of part of it, if you'll recall.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000]  The business about the internal passport, that got shot down in a hurry.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000]  And we can shoot down the rest of it, but you've got to notify the people,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]  and that, Alex, is what you're doing, and what I'm doing is letting them know,
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]  look, here are the problems.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]  This is what that means.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]  It means the Fourth Amendment no longer is valid,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000]  because they can do things without probable cause,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]  without going before a magistrate and all the rest.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:42.000]  It is simply arbitrary unilateral power on the part of the federal government.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:51.000]  And the ironic thing is that the general police power that had resided in the crown of England
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000]  when we were colonies did not, upon our achieving independence,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]  devolve upon the federal government.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]  It devolved upon the several states.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000]  And yet here is the federal government now asserting, in effect,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]  that it has a general police power, and of course it does not.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]  Well, Mr. Letty, you're right that the provision making it the law
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000]  that all states must have biometric national ID cards for the driver's license and ID cards is correct,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000]  but if Clinton signed an executive order in 1997 saying that if states want their highway funds,
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]  they must implement it, 38 of the 50 states have implemented it.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]  The migrants have implemented it.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]  Now the other 12 are moving to implement it.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]  From Denver to Arlington, Texas, they're putting thumb scanners in to buy and sell,
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]  saying you've got to use this with credit cards and checks.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]  They're talking about doing it with cash.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]  What about this big brother surveillance state, the satellite trackers in the cars,
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]  government policy boards saying they want to tax us with these systems,
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]  the TIPS program with the SecureCore group?
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]  Well, now, the TIPS program, that was shot down, too, if you recall.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]  Well, Dick Armey said they were going to shoot it down,
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]  but the thing had already been set up under another name known as SecureCore.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000]  Well, as far as I know, nobody's really doing anything with that.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000]  I don't think they're getting anything much by way of TIPS or anything else.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]  The American people don't like that sort of thing, and they don't participate.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]  There's no way they can really make them participate.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]  But what does that say about the mindset of the government, Democrat or Republican,
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]  that this is what they're pushing while we...
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]  What it says is they do not trust the American people,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000]  and that's one of the problems that we have with this elitism in this country.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:37.000]  They go to the elite schools, and they believe that they know best for the American people.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]  For example, their attitude is,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:49.000]  you, Alex, and I and the rest of us are not able to take good prudential judgments
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]  as to how we will spend our discretionary income.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:03.000]  So their solution to that non-problem is to take our discretionary income away from us via taxes
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000]  and then spend it in a way that they consider to be good.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000]  So more social...
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]  That's the whole attitude.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]  More social engineering.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000]  We're talking to G. Gordon Liddy.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]  We're going to fire up his website and kind of get the bug on the new book.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000]  Here it is in a second.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000]  Mr. Liddy, you were in prison for a couple of years for...
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]  Actually, about five.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]  Yes, for not ratting people out.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:38.000]  And now we have 7.5 million Americans, up from 6.3 last year, in the criminal justice system.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]  Now it's the biggest part of our economy.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000]  Does that concern you to see us turning into a giant prison state with more people in prison than China?
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]  Well, I don't think that we have more people in prison than China.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]  I wouldn't trust the Chinese figures.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:58.000]  I think the Chinese have huge numbers of people that they might not be in prison cells, but they're in prison camps.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]  Well, yeah, their schools are labor camps, yes.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]  Yeah.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]  You know, we do have a crime problem in this country,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:18.000]  and the only legitimate remedy for, you know, serious crime like bank robbery and rape and things like that is prison.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]  Well, they're letting those guys off.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:30.000]  The only thing I think that could lessen the crime problem is if just about every decent, law-abiding citizen was armed.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:41.000]  If you'll notice, those states which have concealed carry permits, the crime rate goes down drastically because of our population.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]  G. Gordon, let me give you five more minutes.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]  I want to come back and plug the book.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]  Can you do that?
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]  Yes.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]  All right, thank you.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000]  Stay right there.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]  We'll be back in three minutes, a couple more minutes.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]  On the other side, I do appreciate you joining us out of your busy schedule.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]  We'll talk more about his book when we get back.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]  Stay with me.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000]  Hey, folks, Alex.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:08.000]  Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]  I know we're getting a lot of callers who want to talk to G. Gordon Liddy.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]  I'm sorry, we don't have time to do that today.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]  Maybe in the future we can get him back up for a little bit longer periods.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]  We have time to do that.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]  He has a new book out, G. Gordon Liddy.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]  When I was a kid, this was a free country.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]  When I was a kid, this was more of a free country.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]  It seems like the Republicans are just Democrat lite.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000]  G. Gordon Liddy, I have to tell you, sir, right here in Austin, Texas, they treat us like criminals.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]  You have to have ID cards to walk down the road.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]  They arrest you for failure to ID.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]  Meanwhile, illegals, they won't even hardly arrest them or they release them.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000]  Just like this Mohammed sniper guy had been in their custody and nothing had been done.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]  They ordered his release when he was committing felonies.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]  When you talk about packing the prisons full of criminals, they seem to release.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:01.000]  The evidence shows the violent offenders, while keeping the good nonviolent offenders in there, are building widgets for Wackenhut.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]  How do we stop this police state?
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:14.000]  Is it, like your book says, going back, like your book states, going back and showing what we had in the past in this country and relearning that Bill of Rights Constitution?
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000]  Well, I think people don't miss what they never had.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:28.000]  What I'm trying to do is show them what it is that they have and how valuable it was and that they should get it again.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000]  You know, it's worse with respect to the snipers than you believe.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.000]  They stopped the snipers 11 times and released them 11 times.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]  Can you imagine that?
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]  Well, they were looking for angry white guys.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000]  That's right.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000]  So they figured, well, it can't possibly be a black guy, so they just let him go.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]  Where do you see America in 10 years?
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:03.000]  Well, I think I see America a lot stronger astride the world.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000]  I think because we are going to, within 10 years, knock out terrorism.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:19.000]  President Bush has said it will take 10 years, and I believe he's correct, because we've got to effect a regime change in every regime that supports terrorism.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:30.000]  And having done that, that will keep our military strong and up to speed, and we're going to be very powerful militarily.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]  Now, Mr. Liddy, hold on a second.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:42.000]  Unless we can stop the salami tactics on our individual liberties, we are going to continue year after year to become less and less free.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]  But, Mr. Liddy, earlier you said violating positive commentators is wrong.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]  I've read the NORTHCOM report.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:55.000]  They plan to put hundreds of thousands of troops in our streets, at the stores, at the factories, on the roads while the border stays wide open.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000]  I'm sure you've heard of the P-2-O-G now, that Rumsfeld's document.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]  Let me read from the document here.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:09.000]  P-2-O-G would launch secret operations aimed at stimulating reactions among terrorists and states possessing weapons of mass destruction.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]  We're talking about provocateuring here.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000]  Our government created Saddam, created bin Laden, did all this, and all I see him doing is destroying our Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000]  Well, I think it's an overstatement to say that we created Saddam and created bin Laden.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:38.000]  Certainly we supported Saddam in the war against Iran, on the general theory that the enemy of my enemy is my friend, the same way we supported the Soviet Union against Adolf Hitler.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]  I don't think we created Osama bin Laden at all.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000]  I think Osama bin Laden was created by Wahhabists.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000]  Oh, you mean the same Wahhabists our government sent radical Hadiths to the Madrasas?
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000]  The Saudis are certainly not our friends.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:04.000]  They are our enemies, and they have these schools around here which are preaching hatred of the West.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]  Let me stop you because we're about to end the show.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000]  I just want to tell you, because I think you're a decent guy, that you're smart enough to know there is this global New World Order.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]  It's selling our sovereignty out.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:22.000]  This war on terrorism is a war on the Bill of Rights, and I hope you'll come out more against this system.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.000]  Well, I've been telling people for years we've got to get the U.S. out of the U.N. and the U.N. out of the U.S.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]  All right, a five-second question.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]  Who do you think Deep Throat was?
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]  I don't think there really was an individual Deep Throat.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000]  I think it's a composite of a number of lower-level informers.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]  All right.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000]  Take care.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000]  All right.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]  God bless you all.
