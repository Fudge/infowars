[00:39.920 --> 00:46.000]  information to go over obviously today we have got the West with special forces
[00:46.000 --> 00:55.480]  backing al-Qaeda and other jihadis in the capital city of Syria we have got the
[00:55.480 --> 01:00.000]  Attorney General caught engaged in criminal activities against the Second
[01:00.000 --> 01:05.800]  Amendment shipping guns and hand grenades into Mexico held in contempt they
[01:05.800 --> 01:12.880]  can move to have the district attorney for the district of Columbia to go to a
[01:12.880 --> 01:20.760]  grand jury and a holder could face a year in jail or fines and they say that
[01:20.760 --> 01:29.760]  they are going ahead with the continued process that could lead to criminal and
[01:29.760 --> 01:35.760]  civil penalties against Eric Holder the issue is this goes to Janet Apollotano
[01:35.760 --> 01:42.280]  this goes to Barack Obama and the 700 plus documents that they've got they
[01:42.280 --> 01:46.640]  made the same mistake Nixon has this is not going to protect them if we put heat
[01:46.640 --> 01:52.800]  on the Republican Party leadership the problem is as evidence by what happened
[01:52.800 --> 01:57.200]  yesterday I was in such a angry fit I was saying Alito it was Robert's
[01:57.200 --> 02:02.760]  appointed by Bush I guess both appointed by Bush George W. Bush who the guy that
[02:02.760 --> 02:07.000]  has seizures the guy was all this medication the guy that I said back at
[02:07.000 --> 02:09.480]  the time and I don't follow the Supreme Court too much to be honest with you
[02:09.480 --> 02:13.080]  looked like he was mentally ill or something I mean I mean Roberts looks
[02:13.080 --> 02:17.040]  like a weirdo but I mean they all do I mean so to my or it looks like a crazy
[02:17.040 --> 02:20.480]  person I watched her in the hearings I say I don't follow it actually follow
[02:20.480 --> 02:25.120]  quite a bit just I mean she looks like a lunatic Elena Kailin looks like a
[02:25.120 --> 02:31.960]  freak I mean I gotta tell you I I'm not a mainline Republican type guy okay but
[02:31.960 --> 02:36.760]  I mean what is going on with the Democratic appointees and I understand
[02:36.760 --> 02:40.600]  that Roberts was appointed by Bush I'm just saying I mean it's a bunch of them
[02:40.600 --> 02:45.000]  they look like mentally ill people I mean if I was out of an event they were
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.560]  talking to me and I was looking into their eyes there's something wrong with
[02:47.560 --> 02:52.480]  these people I mean they're mental midget idiots they really are I mean I've
[02:52.480 --> 03:00.120]  read some of their their findings their comments and it's written like a bunch
[03:00.120 --> 03:02.920]  of prattle I mean I don't agree with everything Scalia does everything
[03:02.920 --> 03:06.440]  Clarence Thomas does but these are well-reasoned intelligent sounding
[03:06.440 --> 03:11.720]  things they say even if you don't agree with all of it Ruth Bader Ginsburg
[03:11.720 --> 03:19.720]  Kagan Sotomayor all of these people are just just just clowns that would
[03:19.720 --> 03:25.000]  shell people out and and and vote for unconstitutional rule for unconstitutional
[03:25.000 --> 03:30.760]  garbage so they were shoveled out of the depths of tyranny to be put in black
[03:30.760 --> 03:37.440]  robes and put in a big marble sarcophagus and rolled out at us it makes
[03:37.440 --> 03:44.000]  me want to throw up it really does and I am not someone who ever suffers depression

[08:53.920 --> 09:01.680]  dot TV backup site prison planet dot com okay the debate is raging insanely well
[09:01.680 --> 09:06.000]  let me first mention who's on today I had Webster Tarpley set up days ago and we
[09:06.000 --> 09:09.320]  knew the health care ruling was coming but we weren't sure I had Tarpley
[09:09.320 --> 09:13.880]  popping in as he's been to Syria he was been there during the bombardment during
[09:13.880 --> 09:18.760]  the al-Qaeda attacks been in Libya under the air and bar bombardment and I wanted
[09:18.760 --> 09:22.760]  to get his take on this big issue that's kind of like oh that's over there you know
[09:22.760 --> 09:29.600]  UN NATO war al-Qaeda is the good guys backed by our government and I've got
[09:29.600 --> 09:33.240]  Tarpley coming on but I'm gonna not spend as much time as I was just because
[09:33.240 --> 09:36.680]  I've got to get into this health care situation but that is important he's
[09:36.680 --> 09:40.120]  coming up here in about five minutes and usually with something this big I
[09:40.120 --> 09:43.840]  would cancel a guest but I'm not gonna cancel Frank Serpico he doesn't do a
[09:43.840 --> 09:47.480]  lot of radio interviews the famous New York police detective who exposed
[09:47.480 --> 09:53.640]  government drug dealing guys we repull me that Washington Post foreign affairs
[09:53.640 --> 09:57.560]  article that you gave me yesterday where they were talking about the US
[09:57.560 --> 10:03.160]  government shipping drugs with fast and furious I think the headline on it was
[10:03.160 --> 10:06.120]  a whitewash article but they had to admit that the head of the NRA is
[10:06.120 --> 10:10.440]  investigating it and says that's what he thinks Wayne LaPierre and then they
[10:10.440 --> 10:14.360]  said oh it's dangerous people all over Washington now think it's about drug
[10:14.360 --> 10:18.800]  dealing and gun running and organized crime in the White House that that's
[10:18.800 --> 10:24.240]  what it is that's in federal court that was in the Chicago Tribune almost a
[10:24.240 --> 10:29.200]  year and a half ago and I guess it was in early 2011 hiding in plain view we've
[10:29.200 --> 10:34.600]  been talking about it at nauseam and so we're gonna be discussing all of that
[10:34.600 --> 10:41.000]  with Frank Serpico coming up and just corruption in general not just not just
[10:41.000 --> 10:47.280]  his story so Frank Serpico legendary whistleblower joining us coming up
[10:47.280 --> 10:52.840]  today okay obviously we've also got William Shatner and we called up
[10:52.840 --> 10:56.080]  William Shatner's people he's still in an airplane to South Africa and they're
[10:56.080 --> 11:00.400]  like oh we know who you are oh yeah yeah yeah he wants to come on show so we'll
[11:00.400 --> 11:05.400]  see if that happens cross our fingers hope to die stick a needle in our eye
[11:05.400 --> 11:10.920]  because let me tell you I love William Shatner that scene when he fights the
[11:10.920 --> 11:18.120]  reptoid in in in the old Star Trek is the best comedy in the galaxy and he is
[11:18.120 --> 11:22.360]  he's my I mean he's I love Ted Knight too but he's been dead forever I mean it's
[11:22.360 --> 11:26.800]  just that kind of comedy that's just but being serious at the same time I've
[11:26.800 --> 11:30.600]  never even really tried to get William Shatner on yeah I criticize him as
[11:30.600 --> 11:33.400]  transhumanist stuff but he just wants to live forever he said that so he hangs
[11:33.400 --> 11:36.880]  out with Kurzwell and all them we'll see what happens with that side issue that
[11:36.880 --> 11:41.480]  kind of makes me not be as depressed that that's what we got to do we don't
[11:41.480 --> 11:45.400]  even go out for celebrities we got to just start off IMDB pro just randomly
[11:45.400 --> 11:49.400]  calling all the big celebrities because a lot of one that being listeners we can
[11:49.400 --> 11:53.800]  just get them on the show boom like that but we'll see what happens we'll see
[11:53.800 --> 11:57.120]  what happens with all of that let me just stop right there don't get into the
[11:57.120 --> 12:02.560]  serious news there is a Joseph Curle article that I agree with part of but
[12:02.560 --> 12:05.960]  disagree with I mean it's all really your perspective it's kind of like Rand
[12:05.960 --> 12:11.120]  Paul well these are the two parties we have and you know do you work in the
[12:11.120 --> 12:15.040]  system or do you just sit there on the sidelines well when the whole systems of
[12:15.040 --> 12:20.760]  fraud you've got to do something again it's the trap of you can go this way or
[12:20.760 --> 12:25.560]  that way but both ways go into the lion's den in the final equation so we've got
[12:25.560 --> 12:32.280]  an article curl Roberts to the rescue for Romney and yes that's true this will
[12:32.280 --> 12:37.160]  make people it's true politically doesn't mean it's right and it doesn't mean
[12:37.160 --> 12:40.880]  that's why Roberts did it who looks like he's on he is on drugs for his seizures
[12:40.880 --> 12:45.360]  I mean it looks like a space cadet and I said that on air when years ago Bush was
[12:45.360 --> 12:48.920]  nominating him I said this guy looks like a space cadet and by the way we've
[12:48.920 --> 12:53.400]  dug it up I'm gonna get to this later after Tarpleys on John G. Roberts senior
[12:53.400 --> 12:57.320]  made all sorts of weird neural order speeches so we're gonna be really digging
[12:57.320 --> 13:03.040]  into this but the point is that that yes politically this will make people get
[13:03.040 --> 13:09.440]  behind Mitt Romney a conservative just just out of pure pure panic over what's
[13:09.440 --> 13:13.960]  happening with Obama and it doesn't even mean it's gonna do anything but yes it
[13:13.960 --> 13:20.320]  will energize the Republican base so that the guy that authored what was a
[13:20.320 --> 13:25.280]  large part of what became Obamacare can become president who's now pledged today
[13:25.280 --> 13:32.240]  and yesterday again that he will overturn it and says it's horrible so you
[13:32.240 --> 13:38.040]  know quite frankly I would love to just have hope and a prayer and think well
[13:38.040 --> 13:42.120]  then we need to get behind Mitt Romney because he's gonna go in there and
[13:42.120 --> 13:46.280]  overturn this but ladies and gentlemen there's a reason Roberts went with this
[13:46.280 --> 13:49.880]  and it's because that's what the insurance companies want the big ones
[13:49.880 --> 13:56.160]  this is the big secret that nobody will talk about I mean it's in the news and
[13:56.160 --> 13:59.400]  and Paul Watson wrote a big article about it this morning with the links to
[13:59.400 --> 14:06.040]  the admissions it's very very important article Michael Moore celebrates
[14:06.040 --> 14:10.280]  Obamacare law written by insurance companies owned by the big banks by the
[14:10.280 --> 14:17.200]  way and then he has all the proof in that article so again this is a tax that
[14:17.200 --> 14:22.960]  they make you pay 35 million people roughly 33 35 37 they debate the number
[14:22.960 --> 14:27.520]  that are unsure where you've got to go buy it and then they can always change it
[14:27.520 --> 14:30.960]  the law is wide open where they can you know ratchet it up and increases the
[14:30.960 --> 14:35.640]  price of the health care and it makes you go and buy it from the insurance
[14:35.640 --> 14:42.640]  companies it makes you go and get the health care it forces you on to it the
[14:42.640 --> 14:46.280]  working poor or others that just don't choose to be part of the medical system
[14:46.280 --> 14:50.400]  the establishment medical system and that's why they admit it's a tax and if
[14:50.400 --> 14:55.680]  you don't the IRS just takes the money out of your bank account and we've got
[14:55.680 --> 14:59.640]  reports coming and this has already been happening and people think this is free
[14:59.640 --> 15:03.160]  health care they have no idea what they're talking about and of course health
[15:03.160 --> 15:06.160]  care roughly in the last two years has already gone up just just in
[15:06.160 --> 15:11.840]  anticipation 25% they're talking about 50% you saw the stocks go up of the big
[15:11.840 --> 15:15.000]  banks and the insurance companies and the health care companies because of
[15:15.000 --> 15:19.720]  course their stocks went up and some spin it and say well that's because the
[15:19.720 --> 15:26.960]  uncertainty has been removed no no they wanted this okay I read it in the Wall
[15:26.960 --> 15:31.000]  Street Journal I read it all over where they're the spokespeople for the big
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.080]  insurance company banking lobbies others they were all for this they get what
[15:35.080 --> 15:40.160]  they want the big banks lobby for all this in Europe they want that money and
[15:40.160 --> 15:43.600]  they want control and they want you dependent and they are going to make
[15:43.600 --> 15:50.320]  30 plus million people go buy insurance from them now and then they also have
[15:50.320 --> 15:56.200]  the nightmare situation where now that they've got things
[15:56.200 --> 16:01.440]  communalized that the social engineers are already saying it will never control
[16:01.440 --> 16:05.120]  what you eat and what you drink because you're making all of us spend money
[16:05.120 --> 16:08.480]  because you have an unhealthy lifestyle so now we've got to surveil what you're
[16:08.480 --> 16:11.760]  doing with your little smart card that you pay your national sales tax with
[16:11.760 --> 16:14.520]  that they're all getting in line this is what the Federal Reserve has been
[16:14.520 --> 16:17.600]  proposing this is what they shell is the idea to get rid of the income tax
[16:17.600 --> 16:20.440]  they're not going to get rid of that they're gonna keep it but just call it
[16:20.440 --> 16:25.040]  the Social Security tax and then ratchet it up so it'll end up being 9 9 9 9
[16:25.040 --> 16:32.880]  the hidden 9 but it'll end up being 10 10 10 10 11 11 11 11 12 12 12 12 this
[16:32.880 --> 16:38.120]  is their plan this is what they're maneuvering us into signing us on to
[16:38.120 --> 16:41.960]  the zombie banks you had an article called zombie banks I wrote a few weeks
[16:41.960 --> 16:45.360]  ago in a video people are like this guy's crazy saying zombies run the banks
[16:45.360 --> 16:50.160]  that's the financial name the public is just so ignorant that's why they're
[16:50.160 --> 16:54.920]  getting away with all of this because I try to be informed I spend probably
[16:54.920 --> 17:00.080]  10 hours a day no exaggeration researching one way or the other and I'm
[17:00.080 --> 17:03.400]  just totally overwhelmed and there's so many crimes I can't even keep track of
[17:03.400 --> 17:08.200]  it and the special interest the crony capitalist that make their bread and
[17:08.200 --> 17:15.040]  butter off of government subsidies and monopolies and bailouts and here's the
[17:15.040 --> 17:21.880]  $10 trillion point not the $64 million question but the massive you know you
[17:21.880 --> 17:28.320]  know quadrillion answer until the Republicans realize that there are
[17:28.320 --> 17:35.120]  massive special interests that are above the law and our monopoly operators
[17:35.120 --> 17:39.880]  controlling government and using it to knock out their competition and create
[17:39.880 --> 17:45.680]  monopolies and combines it's over and the foolish child like Democrats that
[17:45.680 --> 17:50.720]  want free houses and cars and think that everything is this cornucopia of
[17:50.720 --> 17:56.640]  goodies and and who hate libertarians and the rest of it libertarianism the
[17:56.640 --> 18:00.320]  idea that someone else isn't your property or your slave and and it'll
[18:00.320 --> 18:04.160]  well they'll make the big government work they'll they'll create a utopia with
[18:04.160 --> 18:08.040]  it there they know how to tweak it it's just the right people are in charge it
[18:08.040 --> 18:11.920]  it doesn't work like that and it ends up creating massive dependency and the
[18:11.920 --> 18:15.760]  nightmare we now see and you've got the Democrats running around hailing this
[18:15.760 --> 18:21.840]  new healthcare package as if it's heaven on earth and and and Michael Moore
[18:21.840 --> 18:27.400]  saying oh this is the beginning of the what was this quote of the of the you
[18:27.400 --> 18:32.480]  know unified healthcare system with the government run by a bunch of eugenicists
[18:32.480 --> 18:38.200]  in control of it and the death panels and the rationing all admitted remember
[18:38.200 --> 18:44.080]  none of that existed but now now they admit oh yeah we are gonna ration your
[18:44.080 --> 18:47.920]  care because everybody's got to share and now they've got all these dependents
[18:47.920 --> 18:52.480]  who are into this psychology and don't know any other way to make their way in
[18:52.480 --> 18:57.880]  life without a government check who are now the army that is going to rule for
[18:57.880 --> 19:02.200]  the bankers and they will do anything and and again we're gonna break them
[19:02.200 --> 19:05.800]  into what's your tarp to get into Syria where he's been that whole thing also it
[19:05.800 --> 19:08.760]  is take office in the healthcare situation I'm not sure quite what it'll
[19:08.760 --> 19:13.840]  be but we'll we'll find out with the doctor tarp Lee here in a moment and then
[19:13.840 --> 19:17.680]  of course later William Shatner I mentioned that we've called him up we're
[19:17.680 --> 19:22.400]  probably get him on the show but as soon as he's able but the point here is LAX
[19:22.400 --> 19:29.880]  and they go to check inside his pants and it says they singled him out and his
[19:29.880 --> 19:33.320]  pants fell down in his underwear and people laughed at him and he said it was
[19:33.320 --> 19:38.560]  the most humiliating thing of his life I'll read the full quote coming up and
[19:38.560 --> 19:42.760]  again this is what happens at LAX I've talked to people in Hollywood they say
[19:42.760 --> 19:49.320]  it's well-known stalkers are getting jobs there so they can grope whoever they
[19:49.320 --> 19:53.120]  want imagine you get to grope William Shatner that's what you're into it you
[19:53.120 --> 19:57.280]  know some perv at the airport I mean this is how ridiculous this is the
[19:57.280 --> 20:02.760]  Pentagon runs Al Qaeda attacking Syria a little over a year ago I began to do a
[20:02.760 --> 20:06.880]  lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still
[20:06.880 --> 20:11.400]  starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils
[20:11.400 --> 20:14.240]  that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[20:14.240 --> 20:18.480]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the
[20:18.480 --> 20:23.520]  key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight
[20:23.520 --> 20:28.440]  off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral

[24:08.760 --> 24:16.080]  mind. Well some are saying that Roberts did this to supercharge Mitt Romney's
[24:16.080 --> 24:20.600]  campaign. Funny I thought judges were black robes because it's supposed to
[24:20.600 --> 24:26.240]  cloak who they are as a person they're supposed to just judge the law because
[24:26.240 --> 24:31.080]  the Constitution says you can't compel somebody to buy some private good and
[24:31.080 --> 24:35.240]  this precedent is very very dangerous I'm gonna get to it later after after
[24:35.240 --> 24:41.080]  Webster gets into Syria is that's why I've got him here but here are some of
[24:41.080 --> 24:46.880]  the articles that are at infowars.com to Poletano. Obamacare ruling will drive
[24:46.880 --> 24:52.640]  libertarians to Romney. Yeah no no kidding and then the guy that wrote it. The
[24:52.640 --> 24:58.360]  Obamacare precedent the second amendment is next. Kurt Nemo. Key article read it.
[24:58.360 --> 25:02.720]  Michael Moore celebrates Obamacare with law written by insurance companies report
[25:02.720 --> 25:07.120]  more people killed by bees and drowning in bath than from terrorism you know I
[25:07.120 --> 25:10.480]  looked those statistics up years ago and kept parroting it and now it's like all
[25:10.480 --> 25:13.880]  of the news are picking that up that's just what I randomly chose to show the
[25:13.880 --> 25:17.920]  illustration just shows what you can do with the radio show reaching millions.
[25:17.920 --> 25:22.760]  15 reasons why the Obamacare decision is a mind-blowing disaster for America
[25:22.760 --> 25:28.280]  that's coming up but right now let's go to Webster Griffin Tarpoli on Syria
[25:28.280 --> 25:31.840]  because he was just there I don't know six eight months ago or less he was there
[25:31.840 --> 25:35.520]  while there were sniper attacks and things. It's now admitted and I've shown
[25:35.520 --> 25:40.440]  the Fox News articles you can look them up I've shown I mean even Fox LA Times
[25:40.440 --> 25:45.360]  that al-Qaeda was used in Libya now in Syria and now the special forces
[25:45.360 --> 25:50.440]  Western forces are backing al-Qaeda. Webster what in the world is going on
[25:50.440 --> 25:56.640]  with the situation in Syria and what is this bode for the world oil prices all
[25:56.640 --> 26:05.000]  of it? Well as of right now it's inching towards war a general Middle East
[26:05.000 --> 26:12.000]  war slowly by fits and starts one step forward two steps back and so forth. The
[26:12.000 --> 26:17.320]  news this morning is on the one side Turkey has massed military forces along
[26:17.320 --> 26:23.000]  the border with Syria in the wake of this shooting down by Syria of a Turkish
[26:23.000 --> 26:29.000]  jet that had invaded Syrian airspace probably testing so the Turks have got
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.200]  their military forces lined up on the Syrian border in the north and then
[26:33.200 --> 26:38.560]  there's this strange report from a debka file which is not a reliable source
[26:38.560 --> 26:45.240]  Israeli intelligence that the Saudis are sending elements of their military
[26:45.240 --> 26:48.680]  there's a Saudi army it's made up completely of mercenaries right there
[26:48.680 --> 26:53.120]  and no no Saudi princes get their hands dirty in basic training but there is a
[26:53.120 --> 26:57.240]  Saudi army it's it's got some special forces and that they're sending them
[26:57.240 --> 27:01.560]  through Jordan so that they could threaten Syria from the from the south
[27:01.560 --> 27:06.280]  of the southeast or or so forth so you've got obviously an attempt to
[27:06.280 --> 27:13.320]  intimidate Syria right now everything is in the wake of that Syrian it's an F4
[27:13.320 --> 27:18.040]  phantom reconnaissance configured that went into Syrian airspace it was I
[27:18.040 --> 27:22.560]  would call it a Gulf of Tan Ken pattern you go into Syrian airspace then out
[27:22.560 --> 27:27.560]  then in and out and eventually the Syrians take take the provocation and
[27:27.560 --> 27:33.600]  shoot you down it does also show that the Syrian air defense is capable that
[27:33.600 --> 27:38.720]  they're alert that it's not a cakewalk and anybody going in there is gonna have
[27:38.720 --> 27:44.600]  a price to pay so I think that was interesting right now it's a big weekend
[27:44.600 --> 27:49.200]  of diplomacy you've got Hillary Clinton meeting with Lavrov the Russian foreign
[27:49.200 --> 27:53.440]  minister in St. Petersburg that's a preparation for a Geneva conference
[27:53.440 --> 28:00.760]  tomorrow which is it's the US the British the French the Russians the Chinese not
[28:00.760 --> 28:07.440]  Syria as far as I can see Turkey Iraq Kuwait Qatar Saudis not there which is
[28:07.440 --> 28:12.800]  crazy and Iran not there that's even more crazy so it's it's kind of a conference
[28:12.800 --> 28:16.880]  on them on Syria and the Middle East but it's got some of the most important
[28:16.880 --> 28:23.040]  people not there and the US insisted that Iran not go and the other side of it
[28:23.040 --> 28:28.400]  is that the US is demanding that there be a plan to get rid of Assad and Russia
[28:28.400 --> 28:31.920]  is simply saying no so that I think is going to be that's going to be a
[28:31.920 --> 28:35.240]  complete failure but you get me for a moment I mean you've been over there I
[28:35.240 --> 28:39.440]  haven't I found debacle files certainly as a pro-Israel slant and is connected
[28:39.440 --> 28:43.560]  Israeli intelligence but I found a lot of what they put out turns out to be true
[28:43.560 --> 28:47.960]  I mean days before it was admitted that Western forces are in there advising
[28:47.960 --> 28:53.840]  the jihadis in moving into attack Damascus days later it came out that
[28:53.840 --> 28:57.720]  indeed that was going on so did I miss hear you when you said you don't find
[28:57.720 --> 29:01.400]  it to be a credible source I think they're very uneven I mean they put
[29:01.400 --> 29:04.880]  things in there that are that are quite wild but then again sometimes it's
[29:04.880 --> 29:09.040]  true right they they have to mix mix in real things to keep your to keep your
[29:09.040 --> 29:16.160]  sight going so I the summary I would give is this NATO has used the methods of
[29:16.160 --> 29:21.360]  Hitler in revival in regard to to Syria first of all they did to Syria what
[29:21.360 --> 29:27.400]  Hitler did to Czechoslovakia in in 1938 meaning that they they fomented a
[29:27.400 --> 29:33.400]  rebellion inside and then use that to start you know
[29:33.400 --> 29:38.840]  Libya I mean that's the strategy okay we'll be back with Webster terribly
[29:38.840 --> 29:43.160]  terribly dotnet's website I'm Alex Jones with info wars dot com and prison
[29:43.160 --> 29:46.760]  planet dot com we'll be right back to look at why this is so important

[33:34.480 --> 33:37.840]  secretary of the army saying they're getting ready basically for martial law
[33:37.840 --> 33:42.600]  and to put troops in every city oh gee I wonder what's coming oh our guests in
[33:42.600 --> 33:46.920]  the Obama deception broke it down Webster Tarpley it is the global
[33:46.920 --> 33:51.800]  collapse and reorganization post-industrial new world order system
[33:51.800 --> 33:56.840]  and I'm gonna get Tarpley's take on that the health care situation in this
[33:56.840 --> 34:03.320]  house could arrest holder with inherent contempt power and I covered this on the
[34:03.320 --> 34:10.440]  TV show last night yes in the past the Congress had a jail just like the
[34:10.440 --> 34:15.320]  president claims he has this power to kill people he doesn't really have that
[34:15.320 --> 34:20.640]  now if there was an enemy Navy attacking New York 200 years ago the
[34:20.640 --> 34:24.800]  president could say defend without going to Congress because it was imminent but
[34:24.800 --> 34:28.880]  to declare war on a country you'd have to so the point is the Congress has
[34:28.880 --> 34:31.880]  handed over all its authority because the system wants a bunch of people that
[34:31.880 --> 34:40.760]  lay down on their backs but they could also go right now to the district
[34:40.760 --> 34:45.840]  attorney of the district of Columbia and call for him to have a grand jury
[34:45.840 --> 34:49.280]  investigation of what holders done shipping guns and hang grenades into
[34:49.280 --> 34:53.400]  Mexico and drugs back into the US and again this is bubbling over here is the
[34:53.400 --> 34:57.880]  Washington post farm policy calm as their publication fast in the ridiculous
[34:57.880 --> 35:01.800]  in Mexico it's taken as fact of the United States is backing drug cartels
[35:01.800 --> 35:05.320]  and then it goes on it says Wayne LaPierre says this is needs to be looked
[35:05.320 --> 35:09.000]  into and other big people what are we gonna do people are listening to this
[35:09.000 --> 35:13.360]  it's only been in the news for over a year and a half El Paso times come on
[35:13.360 --> 35:18.480]  reporters listening to look it up El Paso times Chicago Tribune we've done
[35:18.480 --> 35:22.040]  countless articles and info wars.com on it you're like well how do we find them
[35:22.040 --> 35:27.880]  search fast and furious involves drug dealing just look it up it's not hard
[35:27.880 --> 35:32.600]  I'm ranting it's just news overload webster finish up with the serious
[35:32.600 --> 35:37.040]  situation I mean in your research opinion am I right to be concerned about
[35:37.040 --> 35:40.760]  this because Mediadev Putin regardless of what people think of them they have
[35:40.760 --> 35:46.240]  nuclear weapons the bankers run us and they've shown they're insane with 40 to
[35:46.240 --> 35:49.680]  one bets with MF global and stuff and now they're moving weapons all around
[35:49.680 --> 35:53.560]  Europe up against Russia they've got jihadi's running around wearing al-qaeda
[35:53.560 --> 35:59.320]  uniforms with flying al-qaeda flags desecrating orthodox churches I was
[35:59.320 --> 36:03.080]  saying Catholic summer Catholic most orthodox urinating all over thing
[36:03.080 --> 36:08.520]  defacing Jewish and Christian graves I mean just acting like complete maniacs
[36:08.520 --> 36:12.320]  and you see Christians rioting everywhere no we're just like good we
[36:12.320 --> 36:15.440]  deserve it and then all the neocons that loved him is
[36:15.440 --> 36:19.560]  llamaphobia they're they're saying nothing about this and I mean it's
[36:19.560 --> 36:24.240]  twilight zone Webster I feel like I'm living in the twilight zone what do you
[36:24.240 --> 36:29.880]  say this is very important about about the massacres right because we had
[36:29.880 --> 36:35.560]  this story from Terry Mason that Ben Rhodes of the Obama White House is
[36:35.560 --> 36:41.080]  preparing this endgame maneuver similar to Operation Mermaid or whatever they
[36:41.080 --> 36:46.520]  had in in Libya last August that the NATO forces would take control of Arab
[36:46.520 --> 36:51.080]  sat and Nile sat and they would push the Syrian channels the pro-government
[36:51.080 --> 36:55.520]  channels off the air they bombed one of them this week to to probably prepare
[36:55.520 --> 37:01.400]  part of that and then they would put on fake CIA produced Arab speaking
[37:01.400 --> 37:06.400]  channel saying Assad is fleeing and they have these fake sets in in Saudi
[37:06.400 --> 37:11.440]  Arabian Qatar similar to the fake set of the green square in Libya last year
[37:11.440 --> 37:16.680]  they've got downtown Syria downtown Aleppo downtown Damascus downtown Aleppo
[37:16.680 --> 37:20.520]  downtown Homs and the presidential palace so they've got they've got sound
[37:20.520 --> 37:27.120]  stages ready ready to do that at that point so they're coming along but now
[37:27.120 --> 37:31.840]  the thing is if you do that and you have a coup if the Muslim brotherhood and the
[37:31.840 --> 37:37.960]  the al-Qaeda essentially take over Syria there's going to be a huge massacre of
[37:37.960 --> 37:41.680]  Alawites but there's also going to be a massacre of Christians and you're right
[37:41.680 --> 37:46.040]  to say those are Greek Orthodox but they're also Catholic in other words
[37:46.040 --> 37:51.720]  Greek Catholic so-called Melchites I have to thank them I stayed with them for
[37:51.720 --> 37:56.440]  quite a number of days when I was in Syria that's basically who invited me so
[37:56.440 --> 38:00.720]  there's a there's a great danger of a massacre of Alawites and Christians now
[38:00.720 --> 38:05.600]  it's interesting that Cass Sunstein in another wing of the Obama White House
[38:05.600 --> 38:09.120]  has already thought about this you got Ben Rhodes preparing the bloody coup in
[38:09.120 --> 38:15.800]  Syria Cass Sunstein and his wife Samantha Power Samantha Power ran the coup in
[38:15.800 --> 38:20.080]  Egypt last year Cass Sunstein has got this thing going against the Vatican
[38:20.080 --> 38:25.760]  Vatican Spring Vatican leaks right and all this stuff that the Vatican is a
[38:25.760 --> 38:30.880]  criminal enterprise and they launder money and all this stuff and this is a
[38:30.880 --> 38:36.160]  way to prepare the massacre in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East because
[38:36.160 --> 38:40.560]  this has been going on it's happening in in Libby even today right Syria Christians
[38:40.560 --> 38:46.200]  are getting killed displaced if the Pope decides to rise up against this and and
[38:46.200 --> 38:50.040]  do something he could really hurt Obama but they want to put the Vatican on the
[38:50.040 --> 38:54.160]  defensive right they want to say we're gonna suppress the Vatican because we're
[38:54.160 --> 38:57.440]  gonna have them you know worried about getting accused of being drug money
[38:57.440 --> 39:02.920]  launderers so that they won't be able to protest a huge you've got a doctorate
[39:02.920 --> 39:07.240]  in the nation history and other things and you actually work at the Vatican and
[39:07.240 --> 39:10.760]  lived in Italy you speak so you know what you're talking about where is the
[39:10.760 --> 39:14.880]  Vatican in this whole new-old order because I'm not Catholic I don't I mean
[39:14.880 --> 39:18.360]  I've studied the history of it I know quite a bit but when it gets into the
[39:18.360 --> 39:22.120]  current things I'm not defending a lot of stuff you know some of the things the
[39:22.120 --> 39:26.480]  Catholic Church does are obviously pro-globalist and things but I do see in
[39:26.480 --> 39:31.120]  the media and in the culture and Obama saying you've got to hire people that
[39:31.120 --> 39:35.760]  aren't Catholics you've got to pay for abortions there is an assault you've
[39:35.760 --> 39:41.600]  had the the the liberal globalist red diaper doper babies say infiltrate
[39:41.600 --> 39:45.000]  become priest I mean I wouldn't even say it's the priesthood that's do it's the
[39:45.000 --> 39:48.520]  predators went in there because the kids are there but then the church did
[39:48.520 --> 39:54.440]  cover that up which is wrong yeah I mean just this whole thing so I'm now
[39:54.440 --> 39:58.680]  ranting but what's really going on with the with the Vatican if remember that
[39:58.680 --> 40:02.560]  the fundamental thing is the Vatican and the British monarchy have been at war
[40:02.560 --> 40:07.680]  for 500 years right since skyfox and the and the gunpowder plot and really for
[40:07.680 --> 40:12.200]  almost a century before that so you've always got to factor that in right the
[40:12.200 --> 40:17.480]  British hate the Vatican and it's mutual on the other hand there's this
[40:17.480 --> 40:24.500]  oligarchical faction the Venetians the the Roman black nobility right the
[40:24.500 --> 40:29.800]  feudal aristocrats of Rome the Orsini the Colonna the various princely families
[40:29.800 --> 40:36.040]  these people are also more hostile to the Vatican than not so the Vatican is a
[40:36.040 --> 40:40.040]  big institution it has within it everything that exists in the world
[40:40.040 --> 40:44.760]  it's probably the only it's the oldest continuous institution I guess on the
[40:44.760 --> 40:49.160]  planet there may be some competition on that but you get the idea it's been
[40:49.160 --> 40:53.280]  around for a long time it's got everything in it and the quality since
[40:53.280 --> 40:58.800]  it's an elective monarchy the quality of popes varies greatly you can go from a
[40:58.800 --> 41:04.920]  good one to a bad one with simply one one conclave but I think right now the
[41:04.920 --> 41:09.000]  thing that I see is that the US line towards the Vatican is to bash them
[41:09.000 --> 41:14.000]  because the whole US line in the Middle East and the Mediterranean is a pro
[41:14.000 --> 41:19.160]  Muslim Brotherhood pro al-Qaeda policy which is going to get a lot of
[41:19.160 --> 41:24.680]  Christian and again we're not just saying that hidden in plain view al-Qaeda more
[41:24.680 --> 41:29.600]  than ever is out in the open run by NATO who are known narcotics traffickers the
[41:29.600 --> 41:34.800]  troops grow the opium publicly on Fox News everything is twilight zone they've
[41:34.800 --> 41:38.600]  got tanks rolling around in cities all over the US getting us ready for the
[41:38.600 --> 41:44.400]  total collapse and we're just sitting here sliding into it let me just add
[41:44.400 --> 41:48.880]  though another aspect of this thing the question of war and peace regarding
[41:48.880 --> 41:54.360]  Syria comes down to this guy Erdogan it's written Erdogan but in Turkish
[41:54.360 --> 42:00.000]  Erdogan or something like that he's the the prime minister of Turkey now he
[42:00.000 --> 42:06.440]  heads an Islamic fundamentalist party I guess an Islamist party call it that
[42:06.440 --> 42:10.720]  it's not quite fundamentalist but it represents a departure from the Ataturk
[42:10.720 --> 42:14.440]  tradition which which has been I think quite successful in Turkey although
[42:14.440 --> 42:19.840]  there were abuses but now the question is how crazy is Erdogan right is he
[42:19.840 --> 42:26.240]  crazy enough to start a war with Syria because if he does that will be the end
[42:26.240 --> 42:30.440]  of modern Turkey I was in Beirut Lebanon last November part of this trip to
[42:30.440 --> 42:36.680]  Syria I met General Michel Aoun General Michel Aoun is like the de Gaulle of
[42:36.680 --> 42:42.800]  Lebanon in many ways he's the leader of the Maronite Christians and he's in an
[42:42.800 --> 42:47.320]  alliance with Hezbollah which the US obviously doesn't like and he said you
[42:47.320 --> 42:52.760]  have to understand Turkey is the most fragile country in the world half of
[42:52.760 --> 42:57.560]  them are Islamists half of them are strong secularists they don't want to
[42:57.560 --> 43:02.600]  have any religious attributes in the government and there's this minority of
[43:02.600 --> 43:09.480]  Kurds 25 to 30 percent are Kurds so what you see right now is the Turks are they
[43:09.480 --> 43:13.480]  became a base for Al Qaeda there's no other way to put it it's funny Rick
[43:13.480 --> 43:17.480]  Perry said this remember Rick Perry in those debates he said Turkey is now a
[43:17.480 --> 43:21.080]  base for terrorists by God he was right he must have gotten a good a good
[43:21.080 --> 43:25.840]  briefing it's gone to rune don't don't go to any hotels in Iskandarun Turkey
[43:25.840 --> 43:29.880]  because you're going to find Al Qaeda in the next room so forget the tourist
[43:29.880 --> 43:34.760]  industry in Turkey but the question then is is he going to take the plunge
[43:34.760 --> 43:39.480]  because if he does here's what's going to happen already the Kurdish rebels
[43:39.480 --> 43:46.480]  against Turkey are getting safe haven from the Syrians in the Syrian Kurdish
[43:46.480 --> 43:52.560]  area and if this if the Turks insist on starting a war the Syrian response will
[43:52.560 --> 43:59.080]  be to foment a general uprising of that 25 percent of this Turkish population who
[43:59.080 --> 44:04.800]  are Kurds and that will be really a cataclysm for everybody because Iraq
[44:04.800 --> 44:11.680]  Iran Syria and Turkey would all be carved if you get an independent Kurdish
[44:11.680 --> 44:19.120]  state so I would urge Erdogan to pull back in other words this is crazy he has
[44:19.120 --> 44:23.320]  gotten this this theory that he's the new Ottomans right he's the new Ottoman
[44:23.320 --> 44:27.960]  Empire the new Turkish Empire and by the way you mentioned that business
[44:27.960 --> 44:32.040]  insider others reporting that troops are piling up on both sides of the Syrian
[44:32.040 --> 44:37.120]  Turkey border and Turkey obviously said four days ago they said on Monday they
[44:37.120 --> 44:41.880]  said if you even come near your own border with troops Syria we're gonna
[44:41.880 --> 44:48.480]  attack you so so Turkey really wants to have a war I guess at NATO's behest and
[44:48.480 --> 44:53.640]  then the Russians have reportedly for several weeks put in Marines special
[44:53.640 --> 44:58.680]  forces Spitznets so what do you expect Russia to do is the 64 million dollar
[44:58.680 --> 45:03.240]  question because Webster they're clearly going ahead with this proxy war
[45:03.240 --> 45:07.520]  situation it looks that way and remember that there's also the question of the
[45:07.520 --> 45:12.680]  campaigning season which the season for military operations is now the
[45:12.680 --> 45:17.280]  Mediterranean everybody should know the big thing about the Mediterranean is
[45:17.280 --> 45:23.000]  once it gets to be October starts to rain right winter rains autumn and winter
[45:23.000 --> 45:26.840]  rains that's the Mediterranean it's not sunny anymore when you get when you get
[45:26.840 --> 45:32.520]  into into October this fog and things like this so there's an urge to act
[45:32.520 --> 45:39.880]  now if Erdogan takes the plunge that will be the breakup of modern Turkey the
[45:39.880 --> 45:46.160]  the people like Hillary Clinton I think are increasingly crazy you've got the
[45:46.160 --> 45:53.880]  new the new foreign minister of France is also a warmonger Fabius Fabius he
[45:53.880 --> 45:58.480]  once had a debate with Shirak the guy who later became president of France and
[45:58.480 --> 46:06.320]  Shirak said to him you're a little occur you're a little attack dog Fabius so
[46:06.320 --> 46:11.520]  right now Fabius is working as the attack dog for NATO so that looks bad on
[46:11.520 --> 46:17.080]  the other hand Putin was in the Middle East this week he was in Israel Putin
[46:17.080 --> 46:21.480]  sat down with Netanyahu and I believe delivered a a pointed warning to him he
[46:21.480 --> 46:27.480]  said dear Netanyahu according to reports dear Netanyahu you have the devil you
[46:27.480 --> 46:32.080]  know Assad and you have done fairly well with Assad you have had peace on the
[46:32.080 --> 46:37.640]  Golan Heights for the past 40 years practically if you get the devil you
[46:37.640 --> 46:42.000]  don't know you could be in big trouble and then of course the other dimension
[46:42.000 --> 46:47.880]  that you point to what will Putin do he will do something what will it be I
[46:47.880 --> 46:52.200]  think this is this is the threat upon which the the hope of peace now hangs
[46:52.200 --> 46:56.560]  let's expand on that what is the Bankster strategy manipulating the West
[46:56.560 --> 47:02.200]  into this to put Al Qaeda light Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt to back all of this
[47:02.200 --> 47:07.280]  destabilization I mean where does Israel really stand in that because you
[47:07.280 --> 47:12.200]  Israel's wanting to go after Iran but but then all the Iranian proxies in the
[47:12.200 --> 47:17.480]  Middle East the the the Hezbollah but instead now they're gonna have to deal
[47:17.480 --> 47:23.360]  with the classically you know jihadist Saudi Arabian aligned groups I mean
[47:23.360 --> 47:28.160]  because I see the constant spam on info wars it's got to be bots or something
[47:28.160 --> 47:32.360]  in there yet and again Israel is a lot of bad stuff all these big countries do
[47:32.360 --> 47:35.520]  all these powerful countries but this obsession that if you slip on a banana
[47:35.520 --> 47:39.480]  peel Israel did it but but I look at the different geopolitical makeup this
[47:39.480 --> 47:43.360]  doesn't look good for Israel and I've seen a lot of noises that Israel doesn't
[47:43.360 --> 47:47.000]  like all the Al Qaeda people being put in around them what's really going on
[47:47.000 --> 47:52.280]  there well the Israeli situation is going to be desperate more or less
[47:52.280 --> 47:55.760]  independently or whatever happens because of the of the refusal to make
[47:55.760 --> 48:00.120]  peace right the the way out for Israel is make peace now make or get the best
[48:00.120 --> 48:04.840]  conditions you can get make peace wrap it up normalize with everybody net and
[48:04.840 --> 48:10.560]  yahoo is the opposite of that but then you look at at the Israeli debate when
[48:10.560 --> 48:14.920]  this Arab spring stuff started right Tunisia the destabilization of the Arab
[48:14.920 --> 48:18.960]  world there were two schools in Egypt one of them in Israel one of them said
[48:18.960 --> 48:24.000]  this is bad for us because we're gonna get these fanatics taking power and the
[48:24.000 --> 48:28.760]  other schools said it won't be that bad because these fanatics will break up the
[48:28.760 --> 48:33.200]  Arab states in other words that the the Egyptian state the Libyan state will be
[48:33.200 --> 48:39.520]  smashed and what we see in Libya to be sure is that the Libyan state has been
[48:39.520 --> 48:42.920]  smashed they're not going to be any threats to Israel coming out of Libya
[48:42.920 --> 48:47.680]  not not anything serious of the type Gaddafi represented because they're
[48:47.680 --> 48:52.080]  the you know hundreds of dead in a given week there's fighting all the time
[48:52.080 --> 48:56.080]  gangs it's a failed state right the wonderful outcome of the singing
[48:56.080 --> 49:00.760]  tomorrows of democracy is a failed state then you look at Egypt Egypt is in
[49:00.760 --> 49:04.480]  danger I think of going that way because you've got the army on the one hand you
[49:04.480 --> 49:08.560]  got the Muslim Brotherhood on the other they could cooperate if both were
[49:08.560 --> 49:12.960]  reasonable and said look we'll have power sharing and we'll have a gradual
[49:12.960 --> 49:17.760]  transition you know a guided democracy and then a full democracy but the late
[49:17.760 --> 49:22.800]  in the Egyptian presidential elections the runoff was between Morsi the guy
[49:22.800 --> 49:27.000]  who's now the president Morsi of them of the Muslim Brotherhood he got a little
[49:27.000 --> 49:32.040]  you know 51 and the other guy who got 49 is Shafiq the representative of the
[49:32.040 --> 49:35.480]  generals I would stress there was a better candidate the guy who came in
[49:35.480 --> 49:42.760]  third was my candidate the Nasserist and that is Hamdine Sabahi Sabahi pro
[49:42.760 --> 49:48.160]  labor pro reform never had anything to do with Mubarak actually was jailed by
[49:48.160 --> 49:55.560]  Mubarak open we got no military dictatorship and no
[49:55.560 --> 49:59.400]  theocracy that would have been the way out but right now Egypt is on the brink
[49:59.400 --> 50:05.320]  of you know pretty serious destabilization Sudan by the way the
[50:05.320 --> 50:08.960]  new thing is they may be a they may be getting a color revolution going in
[50:08.960 --> 50:13.160]  Sudan although I doubt it it's possible anyway these some Israelis would say
[50:13.160 --> 50:17.080]  look at this all the Arab states are being smashed they're all going to be
[50:17.080 --> 50:21.560]  failed states that's good for us that would be a cynical Israeli position that
[50:21.560 --> 50:27.000]  you hear so basically put al-Qaeda in direct everything so so I mean do you
[50:27.000 --> 50:30.320]  think Netanyahu is supporting that I mean do you think Israel is involved in
[50:30.320 --> 50:34.640]  this thing Netanyahu goes back and forth but I think yeah I think that would
[50:34.640 --> 50:39.880]  be that would certainly have an appeal to Netanyahu no doubt and then they can
[50:39.880 --> 50:43.640]  use al-Qaeda to take our liberties here at home and the public so dumb and
[50:43.640 --> 50:48.680]  ignorant they don't even know that al-Qaeda al-Qaeda is a threat in Pakistan but
[50:48.680 --> 50:53.080]  in Libya and in Egypt and Syria they're the the singing tomorrows of
[50:53.080 --> 50:56.760]  democracy so you gotta have double the gotta go to break we're gonna come back

[54:32.680 --> 54:37.720]  get into the latest on the fashion furious situation with contempt will
[54:37.720 --> 54:44.120]  they criminally go after Holder but webs where we got five minutes left I want to
[54:44.120 --> 54:47.400]  shift gears I know you've got to go and tape your own show that's here on
[54:47.400 --> 54:52.480]  Genesis on the weekends World Crisis Radio but we're here at the World Crisis
[54:52.480 --> 54:56.800]  this is a direct tax to the insurance companies from my research they wrote
[54:56.800 --> 55:00.040]  this health care plan a lot of the socialists and people think it's a
[55:00.040 --> 55:03.920]  step towards their communist dream what is your view of what's happened what do
[55:03.920 --> 55:11.080]  you make of Roberts John G. Roberts crossing over and putting it in the
[55:11.080 --> 55:18.480]  basket for Obamacare and do you think Romney will try to repeal it well let
[55:18.480 --> 55:21.720]  me say first of all there is there is some evidence now that Roberts
[55:21.720 --> 55:25.040]  originally voted to strike down everything and I think what obviously
[55:25.040 --> 55:30.080]  happened was the insurance companies Wall Street came to Roberts and they
[55:30.080 --> 55:33.840]  leaned on him and they said listen sonny we know you believe in this you know
[55:33.840 --> 55:38.400]  original intent and all this crazy ideology and we financed that ideology
[55:38.400 --> 55:41.640]  but we don't believe our own propaganda we want that money we want
[55:41.640 --> 55:46.320]  everybody paying the insurance company so Roberts then flipped to the other side
[55:46.320 --> 55:50.280]  and he got you got some day reportedly flipped and the earlier writing look
[55:50.280 --> 55:53.320]  he was gonna this is actually in mainstream news and then he came out and
[55:53.320 --> 55:59.760]  was like crying but look here's the point this is a victory of the finance
[55:59.760 --> 56:05.000]  oligarchs over the crazed petty bourgeoisie the middle class who think
[56:05.000 --> 56:08.000]  that this thing is the end of the world and I wouldn't look at it that way
[56:08.000 --> 56:14.840]  remember my position is Medicare for all easiest reform remove the 65 let's
[56:14.840 --> 56:19.520]  be clear this is not though the socialist free health care which would be a lot
[56:19.520 --> 56:23.680]  cheaper which would be a lot cheaper than letting the IRS be the enforcer of
[56:23.680 --> 56:29.560]  the bankers I want Medicare for all with no no age limit $100 per person per
[56:29.560 --> 56:33.480]  month if you're destitute if you're unemployed you get it for free and you
[56:33.480 --> 56:38.680]  pay for that by taxing Wall Street Wall Street is not taxed they pay zero they
[56:38.680 --> 56:43.280]  pay zero on their corporate income tax they pay zero on their quadrillions of
[56:43.280 --> 56:48.280]  turnovers tax that that's my tax now however let's look at it from a
[56:48.280 --> 56:54.600]  different point of view suppose you're one of the 30 or 40 million or maybe 50
[56:54.600 --> 56:58.160]  million because it usually comes down to a group of about 50 million poverty
[56:58.160 --> 57:02.520]  stricken Americans right they've been left out in the cold you are not poor
[57:02.520 --> 57:06.520]  enough for Medicaid because for Medicaid you got to be practically
[57:06.520 --> 57:14.200]  destitute in many states you are not old enough for Medicare you are too old for
[57:14.200 --> 57:19.480]  S chip because you can get child health insurance right no matter how poor you
[57:19.480 --> 57:24.600]  are you can get it for your kids you're not a veteran and you're not getting
[57:24.600 --> 57:29.520]  Cobra because you're not you know coming out of a job one man so here's the
[57:29.520 --> 57:35.520]  problem there's a mass of people now the result of this thing is Wall Street gets
[57:35.520 --> 57:40.880]  paid but if you're in the middle within 18 months you're gonna be able to get
[57:40.880 --> 57:45.680]  some kind of coverage and I think that's a positive aspect that was it's not all
[57:45.680 --> 57:51.440]  bad Wall Street's gonna get paid yeah look if the opposition is Ron Paul on
[57:51.440 --> 57:55.280]  the one side and add busters on the other Wall Street will get their way
[57:55.280 --> 58:00.160]  because that's there's no real opposition but even within that in order to get it
[58:00.160 --> 58:03.960]  through the Congress they had to put in this thing no pre-existing conditions
[58:03.960 --> 58:09.680]  that's gonna be over you're gonna get some coverage it's written by the
[58:09.680 --> 58:14.360]  insurance companies I mean but they had to make concessions to some kind of
[58:14.360 --> 58:20.360]  reality so I think the big thing is remove them I'm back in Medpec remove
[58:20.360 --> 58:26.200]  the death panels stop the rationing and restore the rationing always comes with
[58:26.200 --> 58:30.520]  socialist health care Webster thank you so much on the nightmare of England look
[58:30.520 --> 58:34.920]  I got I've got people that work for me that live in England it's a hellhole but
[58:34.920 --> 58:39.720]  Webster thank you we'll talk to you more about it next week we'll be right back
[58:42.040 --> 58:48.880]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network

[58:57.520 --> 59:02.080]  if the unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets

[59:57.840 --> 01:00:09.760]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:17.280]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:37.600]  Alex Jones all right it's second hour of global transmission I guess that'd be
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:42.680]  one o'clock Eastern high noon central where I come to you from Austin Texas
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:46.400]  here's the deal I want to give you a chance to tell me what you think about
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:54.120]  Obamacare global care banker care and the Supreme Court ruling John Romberts
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:58.680]  the reports that he changed his votes 15 minutes before that's that's got a bunch
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:05.360]  of news articles people saying he was crying or he was on drugs I mean they
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:09.200]  they were going to announce and the word was that was unconstitutional last
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:15.920]  week but then they postponed it I mean and I said who that doesn't bode well and
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:21.040]  it's because of the trillions that the banksters that own the big insurance
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.440]  companies are going to get and that's what nobody in the right wing is going
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:28.760]  to tell you God bless their little hearts I mean I agree with them on the
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:33.200]  second amendment on abortion but but but on all the other issues they're just
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:38.960]  bamboozled by crony capitalist the crony capitalist are the ones everywhere
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:43.600]  that fund the communist system and they destroy your industry shut everything
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:48.640]  down where you've got to be on the government dole because that becomes the
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:52.400]  economy that becomes you know the the factories are at the prisons and then
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:58.640]  it's a trap that's what this corrupt sickening ruling class has done they're
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:02.240]  putting a bunch of TSA people all over the place from pulling William Shatner's
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:07.400]  pants down I mean this I just want to be left alone by these people I want to
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:12.040]  just have some victories but in a way the fact of things are getting worse so
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:16.200]  much faster is a victory I mean I get the point of Joseph Kerr all the
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:20.720]  Washington Times is that it is that worse is better that's what the
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:23.800]  communists used to say you know they wanted to undermine things so it
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:26.560]  collapsed they could take over well we're not glad the globalist are
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:30.120]  collapsing things but yeah worse is better I guess it will wake people up
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:36.200]  that's what Andrew de Palatano judge de Palatano is saying he's saying this
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:40.880]  will get libertarians behind Romney I don't know anybody hardly that's really
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:46.280]  supports Romney or they say well he's Obama light really is he Obama light I
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:51.880]  mean holders a crook and discredited Obama's a crook and discredited you
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:55.280]  really think Obama could stay in four years and get away with martial law get
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.920]  away with new wars get away with this I don't think so even we try to race war
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:03.720]  like a tribal Trayvon Martin and again I don't even sit here and
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:07.440]  theorize about politics what would work better I mean I know everybody else does
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:11.040]  that I just say justice be done the heavens fall people say oh well that's
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:17.080]  that's not a very you know nuanced or complex way of thinking look I'm engaged
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:20.520]  in a lot of complex thinking all right ladies and gentlemen all I do is study
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:25.720]  literature and art and history and in news and I know how little I do know
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:30.960]  that's how much I know which is a whole lot but I'm telling you the way we're
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:35.080]  going is the way every corrupt empire goes and our death is being accelerated
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:40.600]  our our our rotting degeneration is moving very quickly and it isn't pretty
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:45.920]  and this is going to swallow up the ruling class as well the crony capitalist
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:49.240]  and their and working with communists and socialists is going to end up
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:52.280]  destroying them and they think they can have this balancing act and play the
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:55.640]  communists and the dependents and the welfare people often what's left the
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:58.640]  middle class it isn't going to work and let me tell you then there's the
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:04.600]  zombification of society people either get in the fast lane and drive 20 miles
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:09.120]  under the speed limit I saw this today would just enjoyment that's like their
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:14.440]  power or they drive recklessly some guy I'm in the middle lane driving to work
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:22.720]  on 290 I'm going 70 miles an hour speed limit in the middle lane car three car
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:26.160]  links four car links ahead of me I don't even usually follow that close but

[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:35.560]  legendary whistleblower joining us Frank Serpico and we'll get his take on all
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:38.680]  the corruption in the world he's the guy of course one of the most famous
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:43.800]  police officers in US history who exposed that basically all the detectives
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:49.400]  were dealing drugs and running whores everything else you can imagine and many
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:53.800]  cities have just fallen to where the police are total mafia is now and the
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:57.120]  troops grow the opium in Afghanistan no one wants to hear this it's like oh
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:01.320]  don't don't talk about about the troops the troops themselves aren't bad they're
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:07.000]  the ones complaining about it but the bureaucrats and the bankers running
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.480]  things think we're so stupid they run al-Qaeda in Libya they they're now
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:18.640]  putting al-Qaeda into Syria publicly and it's not an outrage and I know I talk
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:22.920]  about that every hour I just can't get over it myself how ridiculous it's all
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:28.040]  gotten the federal government's building up for war with us the drones
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:34.400]  they're launching this this Obamacare thing is such a nightmare so
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:39.200]  authoritarian so unconstitutional and then you get the socialists that think
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:44.800]  government can help people yeah I mean it saws off a leg and gives you gives you
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:48.840]  a peg that they're like well it is for the insurance companies they did write
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:53.000]  it you know tarply earlier but you're right it is a payoff to them and it is
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.880]  a tax to them but some people that aren't covered will be covered now yeah
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:02.040]  when they bankrupt the whole system and allows them to control the care I mean
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:06.280]  have you seen the banksters have lobbied for this in Europe and everywhere else
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:15.080]  and it destroys the health care system it wrecks everything and you'll never be
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:23.480]  happy until you wreck everything all right I'm ranting and then I everybody
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:32.840]  from Sarah Palin to Rush Limbaugh to Rick Perry is freaking out over John G
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:39.800]  Roberts the Bush appointee towards W. Bush appointee the word is changing his
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:44.440]  vote and coming out the red-eyed and everything and did he have a seizure did
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:47.800]  they threaten him oh gee you think people get threatened when trillions of
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:53.800]  dollars are on the table I mean look at all look look again I'm not even a
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:58.800]  Republican but look at the Democratic appointees I mean they they would win
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:02.320]  an ugly contest and I don't usually go off how somebody looks because I'm not
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:05.440]  the prettiest person in the world but let me tell you something their eyes their
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:12.640]  mannerisms show to my or Elena Kagan I mean these are gibbering weirdos Ruth
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:16.960]  Bader Ginsburg what a freak who says the UN should make our laws go look it up
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:20.760]  and that and they should control our rulings okay I'm already ranting I'm
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:23.680]  gonna give you the number I want to get your take if you can get in medical
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:27.840]  doctors nurses wherever hey you like this idea you think this is a great idea
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:32.200]  or are there people out there that support it I promise that I'm gonna try
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:36.160]  to control myself I can't guarantee it but I if you disagree you can get in as
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:45.240]  well we don't screen your calls 800-25-99231 800-25-99231 the phones are
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:51.400]  open but the guy called in he gave the NPR line of this will do just like social
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:56.040]  security it won't be bad like you say and I'm like thinking of what a Ponzi scheme
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:00.440]  social security is I'm thinking of how what a scam it is how the banks are set
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:04.240]  up to make us dependent and here he is they just believe in this system they
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:09.280]  like it but see the systems coming to an end which was planned to bring in this
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:13.880]  even more horrible public world government run by mega banks that say on
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:19.040]  the news we're their slaves you know CNBC yes we're slaves of the bankers they
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:23.240]  rule us and we're slaves are we slaves guess yes absolutely what about you are
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:27.920]  we slaves of the bankers yes we're absolutely slaves I mean don't you get
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:32.320]  it they want this they want open borders they want government-run health care
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:39.120]  and by the way I'm an expert on eugenics I'm an expert I've read over the years
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:42.960]  probably 50 60 books written by these people hundreds of their papers their
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:47.360]  documents Aaron's read over a hundred books we got a whole library written by
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:52.120]  these people their dream is to get control of health care so they can
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:57.280]  control it the death panels the rationing it's all real or even if you've got
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:04.640]  money all Watson's got money to go to a private doctor he does one of the best
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:08.440]  jobs anybody working here so he's paid the most and let me tell you something
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:13.240]  he's a contractor he couldn't go get health care when he needed he had to go
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:18.760]  to the NHS and they wouldn't help him they wouldn't even do a test he could
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:23.920]  hardly do his job for a month with a chest cold I wasn't watching C-span
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:26.620]  where they get up there and go yes they're waiting a year and a half or two
[01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:31.360]  years for a surgery and they're dying yes it's true we need to do more killing
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:35.680]  people killing old people literally killing them and now they tell you in
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:40.040]  Newsweek and Time how great it is Paul Watson not even 30 years old been
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:44.960]  working for me 10 years couldn't go get a chest cold they didn't even swab it I
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:49.080]  that chest colds before I couldn't get rid of that's about a week of it I go
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:53.880]  to the clinic I'm going to the hospital I go to clinic here in town one of my
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:58.840]  dad's friend's owns I go in there doctor nurse sticks a swab in there they go
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:02.280]  call come back in two hours when we've sent it to the lab and they find out
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:08.960]  what I've got so that I can then get the drug or the antibiotic specifically for
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:14.320]  that they just I'm now ranting you go to the dirt bag national health service
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:19.560]  and they didn't even swab Watson who tried to get well for two weeks and he
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:22.880]  goes in there trying to get in for two weeks and he gets in there they just go
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:26.480]  here's a little pack with some aspirin and some stuff in it you're gonna be
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:30.280]  alright he's like you're not gonna check me you're not no and then he starts
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:33.560]  going in saying okay I want the form where I can go see a private doctor you
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:37.280]  have to get their permission this is the stinking nanny state that socialist
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:41.080]  health creates and again them well-meaning socialists some are
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:45.200]  intelligent they're smart like tarpoli but they just don't understand but the
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:49.440]  bankers understand how this works they understand full well what they're doing
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:53.880]  and there's this trust of the state there's this there's this there's this
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:57.160]  take tarpoli I'm gonna get him on sometimes I had him on last hour and I
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:01.680]  like tarpoli he's a funny guy smart guy but you know he comes here and he's like
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:05.920]  I like Diet Coke I like McDonald's I like GMO it's no problem what are you
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:09.280]  gonna do Alex oh vaccines are good get your flu shot I'm like you know all
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:12.760]  about eugenics and all this but it's like some kind of thing of like believing
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:16.600]  because it's proletariat that it's like somehow good because it's the government
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:20.680]  let's all go do something collective it's some kind of I mean they just don't
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:25.240]  get it they've they're missing something in their mind that historically lets
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:30.120]  them see what's happened and it's so weird it's so weird so I don't hate
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:34.800]  Democrats or liberals or socialists and people a lot of them mean well but they
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:38.120]  just don't get it just like Republicans don't get it they can make all these
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:44.040]  excuses about what John Roberts did that's exactly what I expected because I
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.840]  knew one of those Republicans would defect because that's what the system
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:51.440]  needed this is about foreign banks getting us totally dependent and I'm
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:54.440]  gonna say this now this is what the headline should read no one is saying
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:58.440]  this and this is in plain view I've been saying for two years this is a direct
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:02.040]  tax to the bankers who own the insurance companies over and over and over and over
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:08.360]  again in fact guys just search the term Obamacare is taxed to bankers in
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:11.760]  full wars.com I mean I'm sure we've named one of the videos that because I know
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:16.160]  I've said it hundreds of times on air and now it's finally admitted what it is
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:21.320]  and it's not about how I'm right this is in plain view they lobby to make you buy
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:26.200]  it from them and the government calls it a tax and if you don't the Uncle Sam
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:30.240]  with the IRS collection agency for the fellow reserve comes and takes your
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:35.160]  money so Obamacare is a tax to the Federal Reserve but everybody's saying
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:38.920]  it's a tax to the government it's a tax to the Federal Reserve sure people that
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:41.640]  are uninsured and stuff the government's gonna be jerking stuff out of your bank
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:45.840]  account out of your check and then you'll get government care but the rest of
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:50.000]  it is forcing everyone on to it so it's a government tax and a Federal Reserve
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:57.160]  tax I'm now at the rant point here and again this is all run by a bunch of
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:00.360]  criminals that ship hangar names to Mexico I mean these are terrorists
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:04.080]  they're capable of anything you're not gonna play games with this system they
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:07.960]  all need to go to jail and by the way the truth is starting to come out I've
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:13.880]  got a London Telegraph article here is it time to consider locking up bankers
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:19.240]  absolutely now you're starting to talk and I don't mean the banker down the
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:23.680]  street that gives you a loan to buy a tractor or a car or a business I'm
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:29.600]  talking about the big six mega banks the ones that lobbied in unison for this
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:34.760]  Obamacare and that's all I need to know about it being bad okay now I'm out of
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:37.880]  control let's go ahead and make a phone call here we'll go to Frank Ricardo Matt

[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:03.520]  year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:07.720]  sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact
[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:11.800]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:16.040]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all

[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:57.120]  you know you know what's funny about this i thought the new world order didn't exist
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:03.440]  or when we defined it as mega banks running our society and us being slaves
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:06.960]  and the bankers being eugenicists that say they want to kill everybody
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:10.640]  and then now it's all being announced but it's good to kill grandma and it's
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:13.920]  good to kill babies after they're born and it's good
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:16.960]  good to shut off the energy and shut down the power plants
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:21.600]  and it's good to have checkpoints and it's good to be controlled in a slave
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:26.320]  but it still doesn't exist and i'm bad for talking about it i'm the extremist
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:41.600]  anilo a new world order a new world order i'm burning inside burning inside
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:45.600]  i am sick of it
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:50.480]  my dad's got a dental office so they mail in those southern prairie law center
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:53.760]  intelligence reports that send the barbershops everywhere and it's like alex

[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:03.040]  world government farming and here's a law enforcement cd that comes with it
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:06.080]  i gave it to kurt earlier in the way we haven't done a report on it all because
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:11.840]  i just see what's happening i mean i i'm moron could see what's going on
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:16.240]  okay i'm now ranting it's i'm venting on air let's go to matt
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:20.720]  in ohio matt you are on the air are you burning inside
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:24.160]  are you getting ready like all those obama supporters four years ago about
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:27.920]  thank you mr president i'm getting a free house and a free car now of course they
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:31.280]  didn't get it and you're not going to get free health care either unless it's
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:36.640]  you know euthanasia and prozac what are you thinking right now are you pretty excited
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:41.600]  i'm pretty sick um i actually have an upset stomach all day yesterday even just
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:44.960]  just about all that stuff you don't like the irs going to have your medical
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:48.000]  records and take money out of your account for a whole new reason
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.840]  and you don't like the bankers running your life come on
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:56.000]  absolutely not aka the uh inland revenue service
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:02.160]  yes but uh anyway um there was two things that i wanted to bring up uh
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:05.920]  one is actually uh kind of with the health care um there was
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:12.080]  there was an uh a uh a speech back in i think 1969 by dr gay that went through
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:14.880]  this entire thing that they're going to do and i'm sure you're probably
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:18.000]  familiar with it but um yeah it talks about how they're going to take over
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.760]  health care and everything i mean step by step it even has stuff
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:25.200]  so above that they said that they're going to release the new um
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:28.960]  financial market on a weekend and it's going to be like a winner
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:32.480]  it it spells everything out and um if you've never seen
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:36.000]  something that maybe you should look up it's definitely worth looking at
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.920]  you know you know i've uh i think i've heard of that speech and
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:44.560]  in fact isn't there there's text of it is there a video of that
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:48.240]  no um they're they're actually the when they did this speech
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:51.520]  he asked for all recording devices to be turned off
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:54.320]  and not to uh take any notes but there was one person that actually took all
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:57.520]  the notes and um he really doesn't matter now it
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:59.680]  all happened i mean they were already setting up
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:03.120]  socialist health care back in the 50s in different countries good points good
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:06.000]  to hear from you let's go to uh carolin in
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:12.080]  tennessee you're on the air welcome hi alex last time i talked to you i was
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:15.120]  pretty upset because the hospital i was working for was going
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:18.800]  to force us to take the flu shot to maintain our position
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:21.920]  and i just wanted to i wanted to talk to you about a couple things but i wanted
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:25.200]  to fill you on it on what happened there i just
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:30.240]  decided i was fed up and i left but i don't think anybody else quit
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:34.400]  the last number one hospitals cannot make you take a vaccine
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:37.920]  that's law but they lie and try to tell you it's the law
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:41.040]  then if you say no they go you have to wear a mask now
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:44.480]  like you're diseased and bad because you don't take a flu shot
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:48.720]  that has never protected you from the flu it never is the right mutation they
[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:50.960]  pick a year out and is linked to all sorts of
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:55.920]  neurological problems from narcolepsy to uh seizures
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:29:01.760]  to you name it uh show i mean it's just all a hoax all a fraud
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:05.200]  well they did it and um the last time i was in the hospital they had one of the
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:08.720]  nurses running around with a mask on they wouldn't let me wear a mask because
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:14.240]  i'm not allergic to eggs and i couldn't come up with a religious um
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:19.280]  you know uh out on it so um i saw a nurse run around with a mask she's allergic
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:23.840]  eggs but you told me the masks aren't any good anyway so it's like distinct
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:28.000]  cars ma'am the mask is is to act like you're a leper
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.560]  or like you know nazi germany wearing a yellow star it's all theater it's all
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:36.320]  shunning they're like you won't let us shoot you up with whatever we want

[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:21.840]  it's alex jones
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:35.440]  we're updating info wars.com right now
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:37.920]  i was just on structureport.com that we checked in
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:41.440]  in your link just like we check info wars.com
[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:45.040]  and saw the big headline about if we can put it up on screen for people watching
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:48.640]  on tv but for radio listeners you can just go there the big red link is
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:55.040]  the wiretaps in fast and furious and i when i saw that i'm like well yeah
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:59.760]  didn't i see that a few days ago because it is now
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:05.120]  June 29th but because the roll call link wouldn't work because it's getting
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:08.800]  well the top drudge link's the biggest link on the internet
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:12.640]  that's the biggest traffic link you can get so it's it's shut down roll call
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:17.280]  but i was like wait i already saw that this is just confirming what's happening
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:19.840]  is
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:26.080]  the the congress and issa into the congressional record is confirming
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:30.960]  what the examiner broke you got to give them credit
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:38.160]  back on June 12th that indeed in fact even at articles before that
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:42.560]  that they had the recordings confirming that basically holder was in command of
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:45.600]  the operation wait a minute guys i asked for this
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:49.280]  earlier in the week we're so busy we forgot they're pulling it off youtube
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:54.080]  will you go get due to give you our reports from like six months ago
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:57.840]  proof that white house was running fast and furious
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:02.320]  and it's their press conferences janet napolitano and holder admitting it
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:05.440]  we'll air those i'll play him with serpica when he comes up
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:09.520]  the point is that's that's proof when we don't even need wiretaps
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:12.640]  they admit they were running the program then they just didn't say
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:16.320]  what it entailed and then they're like we knew nothing we didn't know this was
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:19.840]  happening but but the point is i that roll call link wouldn't
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:24.640]  work so i went and found this and emos posting it right now
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:29.760]  revealed secret wiretap tapes trouble for attorney general eric holder and
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:33.360]  doj and i've got the article here i'm looking
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:38.000]  for who the writer is on this i remember seeing at the time
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.480]  and it's anonymous source presented secret wiretap
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:45.680]  applications last week with chairman of the congressional committee
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:49.200]  which could spell disaster to attorney general holder you know i know who
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:52.640]  first told me about this now i just remembered
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:56.160]  and they said judge roll getting shot and that congresswoman
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:02.560]  was actually tied to this and then get me um we need to get on the show
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:04.720]  it's happening because i'm just thinking this all out on air because there's no
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:08.480]  time to do it off air uh wane madson
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:11.840]  see if you can get wane madson on like the last 10 minutes of the show today
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:17.760]  because i remember him talking about his his source that had wiretaps
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:21.280]  and it was fantastical but i mean this was like three four months ago
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:25.680]  on the nightly news he covered that wow wow so the point is they've got wiretaps
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:29.920]  of this of course and wane madson worked for the nsa
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:34.080]  anonymous sources presented secret wiretap applications last week to the
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:39.760]  chairman of the congressional committee and that's issa and now issa went into
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:42.960]  the congressional record today and said he has these wiretaps so the reason
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:46.160]  this news is so big that roll calls covering up there on
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:48.880]  capitol hill they're the paper that covers that for folks that don't know
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:52.800]  what's called roll call hence how they vote it's called the roll call
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:56.400]  they're reporting that he's confirming he's got this so that is huge news
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:59.680]  but the story roll call doesn't really have much info
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:03.600]  stories in the examiner and i wonder how they got all this
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:07.360]  anonymous sources presented secret wiretap applications last week the
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:10.240]  chairman of the congressional committee which could spell disaster to
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:15.440]  attorney general eric holder that's in furious defense
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:18.720]  the evidence reveals high-level department of justice officials
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:22.080]  approve the gun walking tactics that could have led to the death of u.s
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:25.600]  board patrol agent it's more than one the committee has been trying for 15
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:29.520]  months to get information from holder who has used every legal and arguably
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:34.000]  illegal means to stall the committee from furthering their investigation
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.440]  with information from the department of justice man this is turning into nixon
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:42.880]  stuff but a nixon was just stealing some medical records according to the hill
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:47.200]  indicate the secret documents reveal high-level doj
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:51.840]  officials knew about the approval for the gun walking tactics
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:55.040]  yesterday representative darrell issa said the investigation panel
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:59.040]  would vote next week to hold holder in contempt of congress and again they did
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:01.600]  that later took about two weeks
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:06.480]  we can have the justice department is out of excuses he went on to say and it
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:11.280]  goes on to talk about uh the reported wiretaps
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:16.480]  so there you go and again i i don't have enough writers i'm trying to hire all
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:20.720]  these reporters i need to hire more writers
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:23.680]  to understand all this just because the guys i have are great but they're busy
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:26.960]  just posting stuff writing stuff because we haven't even tutored our horn
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:29.440]  which is not what we want to get killed doing this
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:33.200]  but we haven't even put out our articles now the washington post is responding
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:36.400]  to white house drug dealing in fast and furious
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:40.160]  but acting like it's a conspiracy theory when it's
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:44.400]  been in major newspapers again chicago tribune
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:48.160]  el paso times things like that by the time it hits the pages of the washington
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:51.920]  post uh publication foreign policy dot com
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:55.840]  it's just like oh well wane lopier says he thinks it's true and so does a big
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:59.040]  libertarian banker that this writer met with
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:03.200]  and uh you know yeah it's common knowledge they think in mexico the u.s
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:06.960]  government runs it yeah the criminal elements i mean this stuff
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:11.040]  is so near the surface now we are just millimeters
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:15.920]  from all of this coming out millimeters from all of this coming out so
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:19.680]  we'll get the article out of rule call the link to it but it's
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:22.880]  down but we were able to get the tax part of that and then we'll put it up
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:25.920]  there with a link to the examiner up at info wars dot com
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:29.920]  right now uh curtain m o is doing that i think the headline we're going to have
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:37.600]  is something like uh issa confirms wiretaps
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:40.960]  fast and furious wiretaps i mean it's it's it's bombshell because
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:45.520]  before this was just floating around now it's in the record
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:51.680]  so that is uh big news again this is just so much is coming in at us now
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:56.160]  and house could arrest holder with inherent contempt power
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:40:01.360]  or they could have a grand jury and panel in the district of columbia
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:04.480]  district of criminals
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:12.320]  we also now the agent who started fast and furious defending the gun running

[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:14.560]  approves of it and um in school they're actually pushing us to like
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:18.080]  obama they're pushing us to do certain things like
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:23.120]  we have to listen to a speech and i i wanted to go to the bathroom but they
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:26.400]  wouldn't let me they said they said to me exactly

[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:41.600]  humor you're out in california where they try to give you shots
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:45.200]  without your parents consent without your parents saying it's okay
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:49.280]  are they trying to make you take vaccines at the government facility
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:53.280]  yeah yeah they are they um i went to the doctor's office
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:57.840]  a couple months ago and they tried is it oh you have to have an appointment to get
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:01.840]  this vaccine this this and this and no we never went to my
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:05.520]  appointment because my dad said it's horrible it can make you go
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:09.920]  mentally insane let's just say that
[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:13.280]  and well it can certainly screw your brain up yes uh what do you think of
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:16.880]  government-run health care what you're calling about today isabella
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:20.880]  um well well certainly like how to just push
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:24.080]  him obama and they're pushing this and that in health care
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:29.200]  and um same gender marriage like my little sister's
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:33.120]  um gym teacher said she's getting married to a girl
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:36.880]  another girl and well i mean that's what it's all about
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:40.720]  is targeting children and that's where these type of people go and work
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:45.040]  and they want to go over to your little sister how old is your little sister
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:48.480]  she's seven and she wants to indoctrinate her
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:52.080]  you know it's one thing if she wants to go off and do something sexual herself
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:56.000]  as an adult but i came at your 11 i shouldn't even
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.600]  the point is they shouldn't be talking to you about this
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:05.200]  or your sister and again i understand they've wrecked the economy where most
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:07.440]  parents have to put their children in a government
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:11.040]  reeducation camp uh but uh have your parents gone and
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:15.840]  said anything to them about them trying to screw your sister up
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:18.960]  no um they just like they're like just almost knew it
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:22.800]  it's dumb how they're just trying to do that i mean the point is they shouldn't
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:27.200]  be there talking about that to children and the fact
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:30.160]  that we now have to talk about it because they've they've brought it up
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:33.440]  trying to destroy your innocence and look at how they're destroying our
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:36.080]  society everybody who pushes the system it's
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:41.760]  destroying us it's not good listen you're gonna win
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:45.600]  by never using drugs never taking their prescription drugs
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:48.480]  being healthy and helping people in your community
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:52.160]  don't let them destroy you and it sounds like you've got good parents though

[01:43:54.720 --> 01:44:00.240]  now i'm i'm always listening to it and um it's just like it's stupid how the
[01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:03.200]  school is trying to brainwash it and trying to
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:07.040]  make a monopoly out of everything like obama's trying to monopoly his
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:10.400]  healthcare everything well listen you've got to do this
[01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:14.480]  just take material to school they're going to try to stop you
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:17.920]  from educating people and then you make that a bigger issue
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:23.040]  don't conform to their reeducation camp if you've got to be in a reeducation
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:26.480]  camp do what you're doing resist it point it out
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:30.160]  like the teachers say you'll be arrested if you talk about about obama
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:33.520]  al gore goes to the schools and says tell your parents what to do
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:36.720]  they want to destroy your family these are brainwashed
[01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:41.360]  minions of the system and you know the fact that you've got to be in their camp
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:46.000]  can be turned towards good if you use it to wake people up god bless you
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.120]  winning and staying out of trouble will defeat the scum
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:53.920]  thank you for calling okay let's talk to robert in texas robert you're on the
[01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:57.200]  air alex great show today thanks for having
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:01.840]  me on i was able to sneak past allen combs and laura
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:04.880]  ingram's call screeners and dropped some builder bomb
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:08.080]  some builder burg info on their shows on live on the air
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:11.280]  i got that video up at funk master five youtube channel
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:15.360]  uh allen combs was actually hilarious i he got mad and just
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:18.480]  started attacking me and calling me stupid because he really had no rebuttal
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:21.120]  for the information
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:27.360]  well good job you know all these guys still say world government doesn't exist
[01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:31.360]  as it's in all the newspapers as a solution to all our problems
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:35.840]  uh i i mean when you bring up builder bar group for years they said it didn't
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:38.400]  exist it really upsets them that they've
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:43.120]  defended the facade and now the facade is collapsing
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:47.040]  just watch how they react that's why i do these videos because people have to see
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:51.360]  the way these shills react when their disinformation is broken up with
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:55.920]  true information they go ad hominem and attack you or they try to cut you off
[01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:59.120]  and hang up on you on uh you know as quick as they can
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:03.520]  and uh you know there is a lot behind it there you had a record protest this
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:06.880]  year and hardly any media coverage and then when you call on their shows and
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:11.040]  talk about it they they freak out they panic so i hear your brother god bless
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:14.080]  you keep up the good work that guy is called into so many national shows
[01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:17.280]  and that's something i asked listeners to do i don't talk about this enough
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:20.800]  we're putting it all on the line and we're expending
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:24.800]  the funds we've accrued uh to hire i think i'm going to hire like four
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:28.480]  reporters slash editors i announced the uh female
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:31.680]  winner last night but we're going to try to hire two or three
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:35.680]  depends on how much how much you know they want to be paid or whatever i've
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:40.240]  got to figure out our budget uh and then to tonight on the nightly news i'll
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:44.000]  announce uh the male uh winner because we're under male and
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.680]  female reporter but i they're also great i want to hire a bunch of people

[01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:04.400]  reporters and again the sky's the limit if we just can organize things but then
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:07.280]  you've got to check their reports and you know we're having to put more
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:10.640]  editorial control into the office and things because i like to just hire
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:13.280]  folks i can totally trust and pretty much turn them loose but
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:16.320]  sometimes i can't even trust myself because things are moving so fast you
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:19.600]  know you start making mistakes but we're trying to go to the next level
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:23.840]  so spread the word about info wars dot com spread the word about prison planet

[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:17.120]  choose the male reporter and i've i've i've now decided but i've got at the
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:20.480]  end of the show today i go codify some things and
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:24.720]  some other issues but we're going to be announcing that and i i need to hire
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:28.560]  some more writers not just folks who have their own blogs and we pick their
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:31.760]  stories but that's great but lots of stuff that i know is going on and
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:34.720]  people get on and investigate and report on
[01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:38.800]  uh i mean i want a couple more reporters i need a couple more video editors i
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:42.480]  need a couple more graphics people with video and and and
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:46.160]  websites and everything i'm so busy i never even cut new ads
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:49.760]  you know for products and videos or for sponsors i never even plugged stuff
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:52.560]  hardly anymore y'all go a couple days sometimes without
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:56.000]  plugging books or videos then you'll hear me do a whole show where you know i
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.840]  kind of infomercial for an hour and that's just to catch up
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:03.600]  to try to get the funds in to to do all this and we've got
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:07.200]  three million listeners a day conservatively 15 million a week listen
[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:10.320]  one way or the other you count youtube and everything else
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:15.120]  uh and that's pretty much in north america there's millions overseas but
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:18.400]  we're trying our best and we know the responsibility we've got
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:22.000]  we've got a platform here and we've got to do a better job i'm talking about
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:27.120]  myself i've got to realize consciously every minute how big a deal this is
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:31.840]  but i'm asking you the listeners call in to good talk radio shows bad talk radio
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:36.240]  establishment anti-establishment so many radio stations and i started this
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:40.480]  five years ago so i could do a sunday show
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:44.480]  five years ago so that stations could take that and test it and it's been an
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:47.840]  incredible success but now it's accelerating big
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:51.680]  stations you know big big stations but always
[01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:56.480]  independence the big chains don't pick us up
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:50:00.960]  but but the big independence now are putting us on sunday and seeing
[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:07.440]  explosive results uh and ratings increase very quickly
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:13.200]  and are like wow see right now we're reaching the real danger threshold
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:17.360]  i mean i mean here's an example wnox number one station in noxville we've
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:21.680]  got a great station wbcr we've been on like 12 years outside town that
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:24.160]  goes into town it's gotten ratings over the years
[01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:27.280]  when it had no ratings before i was on there to speak of it had listeners
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:31.280]  but you know wasn't really showing up big in the book its ratings went up
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:36.320]  that got wnox's attention they put it on sunday one sunday and i was on their
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:39.360]  show this morning the morning show they said never has the station had a
[01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:43.440]  response like that to somebody you see that's what's happening
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:47.520]  positive and so they're like we want to get you on weekdays
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:50.880]  you see that's how that works that's happening everywhere
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:54.640]  i mean imagine i mean i'm going on multiple new stations every week now
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:58.320]  and they're big ones it it's just amazing
[01:50:58.320 --> 01:51:01.840]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing

[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:35.680]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live i'm going to take your calls a little bit
[01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:39.200]  in this segment and the next and frank serpacos joining us we'll just cover
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:42.800]  the general culture of out of control corruption with him
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:47.600]  but but just briefly getting back to the broadcast the things i talk about
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:52.720]  sound really scary and crazy and i wish that they weren't true
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:57.120]  and i certainly make mistakes sometimes but i'm the first to correct them but
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:01.520]  the general information i cover is right down the line what's really going on
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:06.160]  in this world and we've proven that we know what we're talking about
[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:09.600]  we do the research we eat drink sleep and live
[01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:13.440]  trying to get as close to reality as we can we all look through rose colors
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:17.120]  glasses but i want the truth i want veritas
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:20.560]  that's what delivers freedom and prosperity
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:26.320]  not delusion not illusion reality is going to save our culture in our society
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:32.080]  and we are going towards the icebergs we've already hit some icebergs
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:38.800]  and the fact that now my radio show is exploding is not something i'm like
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:42.960]  ooh i'm a big shot this is great it's the realization of wow
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:46.480]  the fact that i'm becoming accepted more and more
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:49.600]  shows just how much trouble we're in it's it's actually very sad
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:53.840]  and it's also very dangerous and i don't get into being followed and threatened
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:57.040]  and stuff like that happens some and i'm just committed to whatever happens but
[01:55:57.040 --> 01:56:02.640]  just remember this is real folks this is real what's going on here
[01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:06.960]  and the fact that alex jones is becoming more and more mainstream accepted

[02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:12.800]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:19.440]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:24.160]  you know it clicked that wane madson three four months ago maybe longer on the
[02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:27.440]  nightly news said he had confidential federal
[02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:32.400]  informants that there were wiretaps of uh attorney general
[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:36.400]  see it's not just a high level just just part of the sources supposedly of him
[02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:39.360]  that they killed judge roll and tried to kill geffords because they were
[02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:41.840]  investigating it then i talked to some state
[02:00:41.840 --> 02:00:45.200]  legislators and people in new mexico who said that was the
[02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:49.760]  word they had heard uh existence going on all over the
[02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:56.320]  west texas to mexico into arizona it's just that's madson it's so wild
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:59.120]  i mean he's the stuff he talks about sometimes sounds so wild that it turns
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:02.640]  out to be true he did work for the nsa all
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:07.040]  that i mean it is just crazy it is just crazy uh
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:10.800]  because now they're they're revealing secret wiretaps
[02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:14.080]  it's been read in the congressional record that they got holder
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:17.760]  i mean this is this is the white house constates terror attacks anything a new
[02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:21.280]  war distract from this this is just wild
[02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:25.920]  this is absolutely wild but again he's the sacrificial political lamb
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:29.760]  now that they want to divert us off of the socialist health care thing that
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:33.920]  is being spun as a victory because it'll get romney in who authored it
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:38.240]  i mean talk about delusion and i understand politically yes
[02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:42.800]  that's true it would probably get romney in but obama is just a puppet the
[02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:46.720]  system the banks wanted this okay that's enough i'm ranting
[02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:49.840]  courtney in virginia up there by the scene of the crime
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:55.040]  you're on the air welcome hi thank you alex it's good to be on i'm uh been
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:57.520]  listening for a while but my first time falling in
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:01.840]  thank you for putting up with me i know i'm noxious go ahead no so
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:06.320]  i mean i i appreciate the uh the emotion at least you know
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:09.680]  it's it's different than what you see on the zombie mainstream that's for sure
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:12.640]  we're here to get you out of the zombification yes
[02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:16.080]  yeah and your broadcast has definitely played a large part
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:19.600]  um i wanted to kind of throw some out there and see if it was something you
[02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:22.800]  had considered i uh have a sales and marketing
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:25.680]  background so i tend to think of uh how i can
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:29.840]  generate more leads or more people um and i when this
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:34.080]  obama care ruling came out i didn't see much of this overlining but
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:39.040]  um i did see maybe an opportunity for you um if you were to
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:43.760]  maybe devote um like a a segment of your regular broadcast to
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:47.360]  like obama care 101 uh are once in the bell
[02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:51.920]  the implications um we could maybe reach out sure basically they can change it
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:55.120]  whenever they want however they want it's a federal reserve
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:59.200]  takeover of 35 million people but it also takes over the general health care
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:02.800]  system uh it lets the irs you have to file with them
[02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:05.840]  the type of health care you have they can now take money out of your account
[02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:10.240]  i mean it's just the irs and the nanny state sticking their hand
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:16.320]  down your pants like the tsa basically absolutely and uh but i think um you
[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:19.520]  know because there's a large segment of people of people um
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:22.640]  and who are still caught in the left right paradigm so they
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:27.360]  you know may identify themselves as uh you know with the gop or republican who
[02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:32.400]  are semi-awake but you know have the potential to go back to sleep for
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:36.560]  or uh you know along those lines but obama care is definitely one of those
[02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:40.480]  issues that um a lot of people are up in arms about and for good reason
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:44.480]  so i was just kind of positioning that to you that maybe if uh
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:48.320]  you were to do um just a portion of your broadcast to
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:52.640]  um obama care and consolidate all of the information that
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:55.600]  we the listeners could spread the word that it's happening
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:03:59.520]  um and get more people to tune in who wouldn't otherwise
[02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:03.680]  know if you were or necessarily no you're right on on
[02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:07.600]  on issues of obama care gun restrictions anything we should
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:12.080]  and we do write articles about it but that boil it all down but
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:16.000]  i think we posted an article this morning um
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:20.960]  you know basically titled you know 20 reasons why obama care is a disaster
[02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:23.840]  and i think that's a good article to go read it's now scrolled off into the
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:27.280]  featured archive but there's that red link that says breaking that's the

[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:50.880]  frank serpicoe and he joined us last year for a visit and we've got him for
[02:08:50.880 --> 02:08:54.960]  about 45 minutes or so today the last few minutes we're going to have an update
[02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:58.960]  on the secret wiretaps of eric holder being revealed
[02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:02.720]  now that story at the hill crash we were able to find a blog copy of it and
[02:09:02.720 --> 02:09:06.320]  posted it up at info wars.com if you want to read that
[02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:10.000]  this is really coming to a head very very quickly
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:15.520]  with talk of the house going to the grand jury in the district of columbia
[02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:19.360]  as in calling for criminal charges this is getting
[02:09:19.360 --> 02:09:22.960]  very nixonian and we'll talk about general corruption
[02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:26.800]  you know i wanted to get frank serpicoe on about police corruption what he
[02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:30.080]  witnessed in general society because last time we talked mainly about his
[02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:33.440]  story but there's so much happening i just
[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:37.760]  want to get his view overall on the state of the world today
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:40.480]  he doesn't really need any introduction but he joined the new or police
[02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:45.200]  department in 59 a police officer for 12 years his attempts to report police
[02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:48.720]  corruption to his superiors and the department fell on deaf ears
[02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:52.880]  until he was shot but basically over to to boil it all down
[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:56.480]  and then he moved to switzerland for a while and i could say a lot more about
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:09:58.880]  him but best-selling books have been written about him
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:02.960]  big blockbuster hollywood films but he's a pretty humble
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:07.440]  guy frank good to have you back on with us today i appreciate you joining us
[02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:12.800]  hey alex it's a pleasure and the first thing i want to do is apologize
[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:16.720]  for the last show when my phone went bust and
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:21.040]  i found myself screaming into the wall phone there so how's the transmission
[02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:24.560]  today it is good sir the transmission is
[02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:28.320]  super duper and it's good to have you frank
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:31.360]  i want to ask you out of the gates instead of asking questions
[02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:35.760]  what is front and center on your radar screen right now
[02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:39.680]  we haven't talked before this interview what what is front and center in your
[02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:42.960]  mind right now well first of all uh when you
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:48.320]  start the show you mentioned the name uh oral
[02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:53.120]  yes sir did you mean George Orwell the guy who wrote 1984
[02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:56.880]  yes sir okay so we know where we're at you know
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:04.000]  i and um foremost on my mind is that uh you can't trust the government
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:09.280]  you can't trust the media and uh you can't trust the medical
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:13.120]  profession and i want to say i mean there are always
[02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:18.480]  exceptions to the rule but uh uh you know what happens is
[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:23.040]  you have these pundits they get their degrees and they write their books
[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:26.880]  and they change history they're uh revisionist
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:30.640]  so you got to be careful you know what you're reading
[02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:34.640]  and who wrote it and and what their intention is
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:41.120]  so um uh we were talking about fast and furious and uh
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:44.880]  i was wondering how many of your listeners remember the
[02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:52.240]  iran contra affair with ollie north and israel you know delivering guns
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:56.640]  to iran and then also israel
[02:11:56.640 --> 02:12:03.360]  seeking uh an american to uss liberty and then all kinds of cover-ups were
[02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:06.480]  written they didn't know it was an american ship but
[02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:11.680]  uh i heard one of the men on board saying he could see the pilots as they
[02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:16.480]  flew by and the amazing thing is is what this
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:20.240]  government allows others to get away with when they
[02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:25.760]  slaughter americans and they claim to have our best interest at heart
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:30.400]  so what i'm saying is no you can't trust the government if they told me uh
[02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:35.440]  the fun was shining i'd bring my umbrella out
[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:40.320]  uh you know you make the parallel to iran contra that's guns out of the
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:44.000]  country drugs into the country now even the washington post is having a
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:48.400]  report on the fact that fast and furious has connections to narcotics
[02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:51.920]  that came out in federal court they were authorizing cartels to bring drugs in
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:55.200]  that the feds are arming street gangs in the us
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:58.320]  i mean literally fast and furious is the tip
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:02.400]  of the iceberg from your decades of studying this and living it
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:05.840]  uh and and i mean your words last time you said almost all the detectives
[02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:08.720]  around you were on the take or corrupt i said what was the percentage you said
[02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:13.840]  basically all but but i what what would you call this system
[02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:17.280]  there you said tip of the iceberg i want to make that
[02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:24.800]  the tip of the dung heap but um like i say i hear sometimes cops
[02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:30.000]  they say to me oh you're uh it's just like if you speak up they say you're
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:33.200]  anti-american i say no i'm just anti-corruption
[02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:37.920]  i'm not anti-police i'm anti-corruption just last week
[02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:42.400]  a new york city police detective gave me
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:47.680]  his his shield his detective shield and his patrolman shield
[02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:53.760]  that was awarded to him by his narcotics squad when he retired
[02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:57.440]  and uh i don't know how many of your listeners know about uh
[02:13:57.440 --> 02:14:03.120]  the palladium murder and the the gentleman that i'm speaking of and
[02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:07.840]  others that i will speak of i say they are truly worthy
[02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:13.600]  of the title of new york's finest and the world's best detectives
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:21.200]  but it seems they are at a minimum or if they're not their buddies are afraid
[02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:26.560]  to speak up because they will be made examples of it and in this case the
[02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:31.840]  detective i'm speaking of and and the your listeners can go online
[02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:38.320]  his name is bobby of dollarado and he found that two men
[02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:44.080]  were charged with murder they were even at the scene
[02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:47.920]  and they served uh ten years and then two years
[02:14:47.920 --> 02:14:55.360]  more uh in a penitentiary um and he fought not to keep them in there
[02:14:55.360 --> 02:14:59.280]  but to get them out of there and and that's what he did
[02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:06.160]  uh so there are good police out there but the problem is that at the top
[02:15:06.160 --> 02:15:10.240]  like with bobby's case um he becomes the victim
[02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:16.480]  um and um and in cases that are going on in new york city today that
[02:15:16.480 --> 02:15:20.000]  cops that are exposing these illegal search and
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:27.040]  seizures where last year alone 700 000 stops and
[02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:31.120]  risks were performed by the new york city police department
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:35.360]  and one of the men who's been uh suspended and
[02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:42.320]  uh uh because he refused uh to uh give people
[02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:48.720]  uh as summons is not committing any crime and in one case the lieutenant
[02:15:48.720 --> 02:15:53.440]  said to him give that guy a ticket and he said what for
[02:15:53.440 --> 02:16:00.640]  he said um an unlicensed dog the guy said he doesn't even have a dog
[02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:06.960]  but you know who's going to contest it when a cop gives you a ticket uh what
[02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:11.360]  do you want to do bring your dog to court and you know so the system
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:14.720]  is broken and the men that want to speak out
[02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:19.360]  they become the victims and there's others i i don't want to
[02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:25.600]  talk too much about them because um um you know only the worst will happen to
[02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:28.240]  them well that was my next question that was my
[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:32.960]  next question a legendary frank serpico a police officer whistleblower hero
[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:36.000]  uh shot and almost killed for telling the truth exposing government drug
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:39.360]  dealing uh that was my next question and it seems
[02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:43.840]  like you're getting there before i even ask it compared to the
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:48.240]  incredible corruption you saw in the new york police department
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:52.000]  uh now with your sources people that obviously come to you
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:56.800]  is it is it worse today or how is the corruption different
[02:16:56.800 --> 02:17:03.280]  um well the corrupt this is what i'm told by men in the street the corruption
[02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:08.160]  is different is that cops don't want to be cops and bosses don't want to be bosses
[02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:12.080]  nobody wants to take any chances nobody wants to stick their neck out
[02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:15.280]  they just want to collect their paycheck and go home
[02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:18.480]  true in my day they had what they call the pad
[02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:23.600]  that was actually a pad with a list of all the uh the numbers runners and the
[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:27.200]  banks and the dealers you know paid off and if you
[02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:31.600]  didn't pay off uh you'd get arrested and sometimes worse
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:36.880]  and uh intimidated and and if they found that you didn't have all your
[02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:41.440]  employees listed i'm talking about the underworld you would get
[02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:45.600]  fined they ran it like a like a business now
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:50.400]  there are a lot of police that say oh come on a cop would never do that drugs
[02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:54.640]  that's horrible off and but what happened to show you
[02:17:54.640 --> 02:17:59.840]  how the line is so thin oh i started out in plain
[02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:05.680]  clothes that was bison gambling and uh you would get an envelope
[02:18:05.680 --> 02:18:10.240]  every month without doing anything in fact for doing nothing
[02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:16.400]  uh and for not arresting the people that were violating the law
[02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:21.840]  so the the uh the rule in the police department at the time was you had to
[02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:27.040]  serve four years in plain clothes and then they said
[02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:32.400]  if you keep your nose clean uh you will be automatically made a
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:36.240]  detective so here's what happens and they had this
[02:18:36.240 --> 02:18:40.240]  expression the graph eaters and the meat eaters
[02:18:40.240 --> 02:18:43.760]  and the graph eaters were the ones that just grazed
[02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:47.280]  you know like uh they might take uh traffic money or
[02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:52.160]  gambling money or prostitution money and they'd say well you know that's
[02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:56.960]  you know that's just uh devices that people want anyway but
[02:18:56.960 --> 02:19:00.960]  never touched that dirty drug money so here's what happened
[02:19:00.960 --> 02:19:05.440]  after four years of grazing on a salary
[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:10.480]  that a police officer isn't accustomed to and these guys
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:14.720]  would hire yachts on the weekend they would come to work
[02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:19.120]  as in the case of a guard in the dirty 30 they would sell guns
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:26.480]  shields narcotics one guy sniffed cocaine off his um a cruiser off his
[02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:30.480]  police car and he would never have been caught
[02:19:30.480 --> 02:19:34.240]  if it wasn't for a sting operation by another agency
[02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:38.240]  in another county where he left the city limits to go
[02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:42.000]  and um and squeeze some of our drug dealers
[02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:46.720]  so this isn't something that was caught by the nypb themselves
[02:19:46.720 --> 02:19:50.880]  and what i'm saying is after you get used to that lifestyle
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:55.040]  for four years all of a sudden you're in narcotics
[02:19:55.040 --> 02:19:59.120]  now you think all of a sudden you're going to change your lifestyle
[02:19:59.120 --> 02:20:02.560]  so now you become the meat eater and the meat eaters are
[02:20:02.560 --> 02:20:08.960]  uh blood thirsty, carnivorous and they'll do anything for a buck
[02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:13.600]  and now our government is converting from being good old boy boss hog
[02:20:13.600 --> 02:20:17.760]  or what i'd you know with term of boss hog is what you call a grass eater
[02:20:17.760 --> 02:20:23.680]  to now just savage out of control eyes bugging out listen i've been to
[02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:26.880]  new york quite a few times and i've seen people ask for directions who aren't
[02:20:26.880 --> 02:20:30.400]  from new york and be screamed at and just the example of you know a
[02:20:30.400 --> 02:20:34.880]  corruption accelerating uh and i've had i mean i've seen videos of our
[02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:39.440]  reporters and in in in one case luke redalsky was
[02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:44.000]  protesting out front building seven talking about larry silverstein's
[02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:48.960]  involvement in 9-11 and the security guards come out
[02:20:48.960 --> 02:20:52.480]  looking like guys out of goodfellas smoking pipes
[02:20:52.480 --> 02:20:55.600]  you know the classic thug with a pipe thinking he's a gentleman
[02:20:55.600 --> 02:20:59.920]  and going with a cartoon gangster accent
[02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:05.120]  uh going you know what's gonna happen we're gonna call the police and say
[02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:09.600]  your camera's a bomb you're gonna get shied with terrorism and i know
[02:21:09.600 --> 02:21:13.760]  i know you're not a terrorist but you're gonna get 30 days in the hole
[02:21:13.760 --> 02:21:17.920]  the cops show up the gangsters literally out of central casting
[02:21:17.920 --> 02:21:21.520]  but if i was a hollywood director i would hire them for sopranos
[02:21:21.520 --> 02:21:26.400]  then commands 20 police or so who grab him and take his camera and say it's a
[02:21:26.400 --> 02:21:29.840]  gun and a bomb i mean this is listen i have this
[02:21:29.840 --> 02:21:33.440]  on tape they didn't even bother to erase the tape
[02:21:33.440 --> 02:21:37.760]  they frame him on tape and don't even care and don't even erase the tape
[02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:42.080]  that to me showed such incredible
[02:21:42.080 --> 02:21:48.000]  in such incredible hubris that they and now i see footage that um
[02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:52.640]  are uh corresponded shoot new york where the police walk around with
[02:21:52.640 --> 02:21:58.400]  cigarettes and and and cigars uh arresting abc news reporters there's
[02:21:58.400 --> 02:22:02.640]  footage of that online with their hats on sideways i mean now it's
[02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:06.560]  becoming comical and and now i'm seeing in other parts of the
[02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:09.360]  country take seattle where i saw articles even in their
[02:22:09.360 --> 02:22:13.440]  local paper where the police in some areas own half the bars because they
[02:22:13.440 --> 02:22:17.280]  will sell themselves drugs in the bathroom and then take the people's
[02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:20.560]  bars so now they're not even shaking down criminals
[02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:24.080]  which is the old excuse as you know for grazers or whatever
[02:22:24.080 --> 02:22:27.280]  so so they're becoming survival the fittest the
[02:22:27.280 --> 02:22:31.520]  the bigger the meat eater the more power they get and so
[02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:34.400]  now what a meat eater would have been
[02:22:34.400 --> 02:22:37.680]  20 years ago is now a grazer do you see what i'm saying
[02:22:37.680 --> 02:22:43.440]  yeah yeah there was one uh uh police and uh commander
[02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:49.040]  he even uh complained to this guy instead if it wasn't for that f and so
[02:22:49.040 --> 02:22:52.240]  pico i would have been a millionaire today
[02:22:52.240 --> 02:22:56.400]  so it shows you the amount of money that's floating out there
[02:22:56.400 --> 02:23:01.040]  and in the new york times op ed monday june 18th
[02:23:01.040 --> 02:23:06.080]  of this year is an article we're called policing by the numbers
[02:23:06.080 --> 02:23:12.560]  and it's uh written by a john eternal uh who's a retired new york city police
[02:23:12.560 --> 02:23:17.200]  captain he's a professor of criminal justice
[02:23:17.200 --> 02:23:24.720]  and all that stuff but he says um an officer assigned to an impact zone
[02:23:24.720 --> 02:23:30.640]  a high crime area told me that the constitution does quote the constitution
[02:23:30.640 --> 02:23:34.720]  has been thrown out the window when it comes to stops
[02:23:34.720 --> 02:23:40.240]  he is given strict daily quotas and asked at the end of his tour about his
[02:23:40.240 --> 02:23:44.880]  numbers an officer who fails to meet the required number
[02:23:44.880 --> 02:23:49.280]  for the day is berated sometimes in front of his
[02:23:49.280 --> 02:23:54.720]  not allowed time off and given unpalatable work assignments
[02:23:54.720 --> 02:24:00.480]  nothing is asked about maintaining order interacting with the community
[02:24:00.480 --> 02:24:04.320]  or other kinds of police works the result of this
[02:24:04.320 --> 02:24:10.160]  performance culture needless summons is for minor violations putting
[02:24:10.160 --> 02:24:14.960]  one's feet on the subway seats playing chess in a park
[02:24:14.960 --> 02:24:18.800]  failing to wear a seat belt another quota-driven activity
[02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:22.560]  this does not make for efficient policing
[02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:29.280]  etc so that's where it is today i am at another police officer said to me
[02:24:29.280 --> 02:24:37.040]  uh our cop today is nothing more than an armed tax collector i mean
[02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:42.160]  these people who have legitimate permits these vendors on the street
[02:24:42.160 --> 02:24:46.160]  trying to make a limit uh they're given fines at times
[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:51.520]  up to a thousand dollars how are they ever going to pay these fines
[02:24:51.520 --> 02:24:54.720]  and and the crazy thing is if you go out of the city
[02:24:54.720 --> 02:24:59.520]  and you can make a turn you can make a right turn on a red light
[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:05.200]  when it's safe in the city you try that and the ticket is like a hundred dollars
[02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:09.200]  they tow your cars away it's just now listen i talked to people that i've
[02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:12.880]  known for like 16 years he owned a couple dump trucks made a
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:16.080]  decent living now he's just out of business because of the
[02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:19.600]  fines and fees they'll even pull a new truck over and say there's dirt on the
[02:25:19.600 --> 02:25:22.480]  bumper here in austin and the cops just don't care
[02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:26.000]  they're all people are going bankrupt only big companies can come in
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:29.840]  and then pass on the expenses to people that hire them it's destroying the
[02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:33.520]  economy and the government loves it they love it it's just i mean they're
[02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:37.760]  going to kill this country yeah yeah this guy goes on to
[02:25:37.760 --> 02:25:42.480]  say policing in a democracy is not easy nor is it meant to be
[02:25:42.480 --> 02:25:49.440]  reducing crime numbers is simple if you disregard basic rights ignore victims
[02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:55.600]  mandate quotas and manipulate numbers the lunacy of this policy performance
[02:25:55.600 --> 02:25:59.040]  culture can end only with stranger leadership
[02:25:59.040 --> 02:26:04.400]  greater transparency uh stronger leadership that is uh which would be
[02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:08.480]  strange uh greater transparency and more meaningful
[02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:13.040]  relationship with communities and then it says it is worth
[02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:18.880]  heating what detective frank serpico testified on police corruption told the
[02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:25.040]  nap commission in 1971 quote the department must realize
[02:26:25.040 --> 02:26:30.240]  that an effective continuing relationship between the police and the public
[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:35.040]  is more important than an impressive arrest record
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:40.640]  uh and that's what i became a cop for frank where is it all going
[02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:44.160]  where is it all going because you're in one jurisdiction and the police are
[02:26:44.160 --> 02:26:48.320]  changing flat tires helping people actually going after bad guys but
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:51.520]  that's more and more rare and you go in another jurisdiction i don't care if
[02:26:51.520 --> 02:26:55.600]  it's in the south the north the west and the police are crazed
[02:26:55.600 --> 02:27:00.320]  wild-eyed thugs who instinctively i i can just by their bearing
[02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:04.800]  automatically tell her the enemy of of society i mean where is this going from
[02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:07.920]  your research and your experience if the corruption
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:14.320]  continues to grow this fast well it's uh it's not going good uh if it's not
[02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:18.320]  stopped because uh this kind of activity
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:22.320]  doesn't happen if it's not condoned at the top
[02:27:22.320 --> 02:27:27.760]  uh for example the uh the commissioner in new york in charge of press
[02:27:27.760 --> 02:27:32.080]  relations uh you know he commented about me
[02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:36.480]  he says my comments are born out of ignorance uh
[02:27:36.480 --> 02:27:41.440]  from being away for 40 years and my response to him is well what's his
[02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:45.600]  excuse doesn't he watch uh and see uh you know all these
[02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:49.760]  videos that are being taken by independent people of the
[02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:54.960]  harassment and uh that's my question how could police
[02:27:54.960 --> 02:28:01.200]  walk up on a video and say we're going to say your camera is a gun and a bomb
[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:04.720]  and and then and then and frame someone on tape
[02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:09.200]  and not even care to erase the tape i mean where this confidence says
[02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:13.040]  they're going to get promoted for stomping on somebody's rights and
[02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:17.440]  setting them up well i didn't know if you know the case of
[02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:24.240]  adrian schoolcraft uh uh a police officer who refused to go along and
[02:28:24.240 --> 02:28:28.880]  they broke into his house that night hand cuffed him behind his back and
[02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:32.880]  took him to the psycho ward where he was handcuffed to a gurney
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:37.840]  for six days and then you read the police blog and nobody wants to believe
[02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:42.720]  it because you can't just psycho a guy with uh
[02:28:42.720 --> 02:28:47.280]  you know um but if it's the mayor and the police
[02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:51.840]  commissioner who's behind it then you know who's gonna
[02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:56.640]  say no and um so it's really terrible and
[02:28:56.640 --> 02:29:00.000]  what amazes me is that the the people aren't up
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:08.000]  in arms as they uh did uh in um in egypt you know you think the people
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:13.520]  would have had enough uh and say no more but um
[02:29:13.520 --> 02:29:19.120]  somehow um i'm sure you're familiar with uh
[02:29:19.120 --> 02:29:26.000]  young marcus tulius cicero who back in uh it was 70 years before the birth of
[02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:30.080]  christ and the roman republic uh the foremost
[02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:34.880]  tower of its day had reached its zenith and its leadership had attained unbound
[02:29:34.880 --> 02:29:38.720]  wealth and unstincted power the rules were intolerant of
[02:29:38.720 --> 02:29:42.320]  restraint indifferent to the man i'll tell you what frank serpicoe stay there

[02:33:05.200 --> 02:33:09.760]  wow that's perfect timing i was talking to frank serpico and i said you know
[02:33:09.760 --> 02:33:14.320]  what's the bottom line he said it's mind control
[02:33:14.320 --> 02:33:18.800]  and then that bumper plays frank repeat what you were saying off there
[02:33:18.800 --> 02:33:23.760]  um i mean on all those issues you were saying well your show says it all
[02:33:23.760 --> 02:33:26.800]  war on for your mind what's going on here well
[02:33:26.800 --> 02:33:30.320]  um the human race has been torn to the highest bidder
[02:33:30.320 --> 02:33:34.640]  you know i mean it amazes me that these young kids
[02:33:34.640 --> 02:33:40.240]  kowtow you know to all these uh you know the pope the queen the media the
[02:33:40.240 --> 02:33:44.640]  government you know the queen who is one of the
[02:33:44.640 --> 02:33:48.240]  uh whatever she is she's certainly not a princess
[02:33:48.240 --> 02:33:53.200]  you know the queen b with the bees works more than the rest of the workers
[02:33:53.200 --> 02:33:58.240]  uh these people who have exploited the world and races
[02:33:58.240 --> 02:34:02.480]  uh that people should curtsy to them i mean it is
[02:34:02.480 --> 02:34:08.320]  mind boggling it's insane that they think that they're better than the rest of
[02:34:08.320 --> 02:34:11.680]  the human race i mean you know what i'm talking about where
[02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:15.200]  you know if you're with the prince or you're with them you have to curtsy
[02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:19.040]  my god i mean one of the people going to wake up you know they're being held
[02:34:19.040 --> 02:34:22.240]  prisoners in their own minds
[02:34:22.800 --> 02:34:28.000]  you're absolutely right and then you know i get a letter from the naa cp which i
[02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:31.440]  remember and uh you know i believe in equality and justice
[02:34:31.440 --> 02:34:36.400]  but they say frank taking a stand for what is right sometimes comes with grave
[02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:39.680]  consequences yes that's true and then they go
[02:34:39.680 --> 02:34:44.480]  since taking office as you know attorney general what they're saying
[02:34:44.480 --> 02:34:48.080]  sadly extreme elements within the u.s house
[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:53.840]  are threatening the attorney but i mean this what's happening
[02:34:53.840 --> 02:34:58.960]  uh it's um there are no principles it should be principles above
[02:34:58.960 --> 02:35:04.000]  personality and um it's all this cronyism and i wish
[02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:10.800]  uh these young kids today they would wake up and um well you remember what
[02:35:10.800 --> 02:35:14.240]  happened at kent state when the national guard opened fire on its own
[02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:17.120]  citizens maybe that's what they're afraid of but
[02:35:17.120 --> 02:35:20.160]  um well let me raise that because it's funny you brought that up they're
[02:35:20.160 --> 02:35:22.480]  announcing more more military on the streets
[02:35:22.480 --> 02:35:25.760]  secretary of the army wants to station a brigade in every city
[02:35:25.760 --> 02:35:29.360]  it's not for al-qaeda now they're their little buddies they're using over in
[02:35:29.360 --> 02:35:33.920]  libyan siri it's for us they're announcing armed drones they're announcing
[02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:37.200]  450 million rounds of 40 cal hollow point four

[02:35:40.720 --> 02:35:46.640]  uh pill boxes uh what do you think this whole build up is for sarpica
[02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:51.360]  well uh if it's uh the way it's happening it's not for the good it's
[02:35:51.360 --> 02:35:57.040]  just to press the masses uh we got another um
[02:35:57.040 --> 02:36:01.360]  uh syria uh you know it's going to be uh
[02:36:01.360 --> 02:36:06.000]  the u.s. is uh they say to united states but
[02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:11.040]  the people have to get united against oppression is what they have to do and
[02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:16.240]  this is what the government is afraid of so uh they're going to uh
[02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:21.840]  you know control the people by force of arms
[02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:26.160]  and uh you know i mean i live in a country i mean the
[02:36:26.160 --> 02:36:31.360]  you know what they say um i can spend i can spend a buck i could um
[02:36:31.360 --> 02:36:35.440]  run a trial line and uh country boy can survive you know
[02:36:35.440 --> 02:36:41.440]  uh the people are arming up uh they don't trust the government so
[02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:46.880]  you know it's it's not just a few it's those that are awake and
[02:36:46.880 --> 02:36:51.040]  you know are they going to say that i'm you know i'm i'm talking uh
[02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:57.600]  uh you know uh accuse me of trying to cite the masses
[02:36:57.600 --> 02:37:00.880]  you don't know what this government is capable of
[02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:04.800]  and let me tell you you know you were saying i was in switzerland
[02:37:04.800 --> 02:37:08.080]  you know why i left switzerland because i was run out
[02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:13.840]  by the fbi uh because they wanted me to come back to new york and be a part of
[02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:19.040]  their sham and i refused and they sent out a subpoena and said i would be
[02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:23.920]  held in contempt if i refused and so i had to take it on the
[02:37:23.920 --> 02:37:29.840]  lamb in uh how to switzerland but again you have one country you
[02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:33.680]  have another country i i ended up in holland um
[02:37:33.680 --> 02:37:39.680]  and uh i i ended up pulling a little kid out of the canal uh that had fallen
[02:37:39.680 --> 02:37:44.960]  into the canal and a crowd um you know assembled and then the police and i
[02:37:44.960 --> 02:37:48.400]  i snuck out through the crowd before the police got there
[02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:53.520]  then a couple of nights later uh there was a burglary in progress across the
[02:37:53.520 --> 02:37:56.960]  canal because i was living on the canal and i had my dog with me and he was
[02:37:56.960 --> 02:38:03.200]  back and i looked and uh call it muscle memory or reflex i called the
[02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:07.520]  police and then i went out there and they they had the um
[02:38:07.520 --> 02:38:11.920]  the guy uh and uh with all the booty it took off the boat and
[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:18.160]  i was really impressed by the way that he uh was handled by the police and the
[02:38:18.160 --> 02:38:21.040]  next morning two detectives came to my door and
[02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:25.600]  escorted me to police headquarters and they brought me through the cells and i
[02:38:25.600 --> 02:38:29.600]  thought are they going to throw me in the flammer but at least i thought look at
[02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:34.320]  this you can eat off the floor here stainless steel and uh it was civil not
[02:38:34.320 --> 02:38:38.560]  like the dungeons they have in new york and other places and then they didn't
[02:38:38.560 --> 02:38:42.160]  throw me in there they brought me upstairs to the police commissioner
[02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:45.600]  and the commissioner a gray-haired gentleman
[02:38:45.600 --> 02:38:50.800]  he jumped to his feet he reached out his hand and he said mania
[02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:56.480]  sir may i shake your hand and i thought what am i dreaming or something
[02:38:56.480 --> 02:39:00.960]  he had a copy of his book on my desk on his desk
[02:39:00.960 --> 02:39:04.480]  and i said it's always a pleasure to shake the hand of a police officer that
[02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:08.800]  wants to shake my hand uh and that's what i wrote in his book
[02:39:08.800 --> 02:39:14.640]  and a couple years ago when uh uh i was involved with um the drug
[02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:19.040]  wars uh the damage done the drug wars and uh it was
[02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:23.600]  premiering in amsterdam the police commissioner the new police
[02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:31.120]  commissioner came uh to introduce me and he said in 1974
[02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:38.400]  i had to choose between becoming uh an f-16 pilot or the sports academy
[02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:42.000]  and he says and then i saw a movie called surfy coast
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:47.360]  and my mind was made up so my point is what we have to do
[02:39:47.360 --> 02:39:51.760]  we have to inspire people uh because by our deeds
[02:39:51.760 --> 02:39:56.080]  they're like pebbles that you throw into a body of water they make ripples
[02:39:56.080 --> 02:40:02.320]  and i never would have imagined that you know 30 40 years after
[02:40:02.320 --> 02:40:08.400]  people are still uh being inspired and and that's what the people need they
[02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:12.800]  need inspiration well like your show that you know tells people what's really
[02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:18.240]  going on in the world and um but uh you know
[02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:21.120]  i know they play with words they got their own
[02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:24.480]  their own vocabulary they say freedom isn't free
[02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:27.520]  you bet your ass it isn't free you have to fight for it
[02:40:27.520 --> 02:40:31.680]  but not in foreign countries right here in our own country that's where they
[02:40:31.680 --> 02:40:37.120]  you have to fight for your freedom wow frank serpico this is a amazing
[02:40:37.120 --> 02:40:41.120]  interview you are definitely on fire today we're going to overdrive folks we
[02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:44.560]  can finish the hour with them we're just going to go into the fourth hour with
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:47.200]  wane madson coming up if he's able to do that with
[02:40:47.200 --> 02:40:50.960]  he's got the inside scoop on fast and furious murders all of it
[02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:56.720]  uh former nsa uh a officer and congressional reporter uh he he
[02:40:56.720 --> 02:40:59.600]  everything he told me three or four months ago was actually about a year
[02:40:59.600 --> 02:41:01.760]  ago but three or four months ago really got clear with
[02:41:01.760 --> 02:41:05.920]  informants and people he had to leave the country for a while over all this
[02:41:05.920 --> 02:41:08.960]  he's going to be joining us uh dealing with it because reportedly the white
[02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:12.480]  house had a hit man out after him but once that went public they left him
[02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:16.800]  alone that's another issue just to talk about freedom not being free
[02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:20.400]  you know they killed the dc madam after she was on my show
[02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:24.640]  and they just throw these lies at everybody and when everybody starts
[02:41:24.640 --> 02:41:28.160]  just trying to go along to get along that's what allows corruption to run
[02:41:28.160 --> 02:41:33.280]  rampant but what frank was talking about all the good police he's inspired
[02:41:33.280 --> 02:41:37.440]  and others and and that's what you've got to do all of us doing little things
[02:41:37.440 --> 02:41:41.040]  like the pebbles in a pond but you can feel
[02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:45.040]  the the the evil intensifying right now you can see
[02:41:45.040 --> 02:41:50.320]  the insane corruption frank let me raise uh a curveball on you here
[02:41:50.320 --> 02:41:52.800]  because you know we didn't talk before you came on today
[02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:58.320]  what about 9 11 it's been used as the foundation of everything that we see
[02:41:58.320 --> 02:42:01.600]  happening that the warrantless spying that's illegal the
[02:42:01.600 --> 02:42:05.680]  highway checkpoints all over the country the tsa
[02:42:05.680 --> 02:42:09.040]  sticking their hands down our pants i want to ask you about that
[02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:14.160]  uh william shatner now being wrote by him uh today leaving lax i mean oh here's
[02:42:14.160 --> 02:42:18.720]  william shatner let's pull his pants down you know i mean he may be a terrorist
[02:42:18.720 --> 02:42:22.320]  this this training is all that we're prisoners while ignoring the real
[02:42:22.320 --> 02:42:26.320]  criminals that are all around us but but the official story of 9 11
[02:42:26.320 --> 02:42:29.840]  uh i mean now am we're all the lockie number three in al qaeda they admit was
[02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:33.440]  really cia the head of the 7 7 bombings they admit was
[02:42:33.440 --> 02:42:37.840]  mi6 now they publicly use al qaeda to take over libya
[02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:42.320]  and now syria and they admit this in the news well yeah al qaeda
[02:42:42.320 --> 02:42:46.720]  is working for us but they're good guys but i've got to have tsa growth my
[02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:50.400]  family and william shatner's got to have him pull his pants down
[02:42:50.400 --> 02:42:53.360]  because they're going in his pants and that's what they did they they went in
[02:42:53.360 --> 02:42:56.560]  his pants they fell off it happens all the time to people
[02:42:56.560 --> 02:43:00.320]  make old ladies get out of wheelchairs i mean i'm ranting here serpa co but but
[02:43:00.320 --> 02:43:04.000]  this this foundation of 9 11 what's your view on that
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:08.240]  first of all you know i refuse to fly because when i came back in the country
[02:43:08.240 --> 02:43:12.400]  i was stripped searched uh by the customs people
[02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:17.040]  and uh they knew everything that was going on uh in my life for over the
[02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:23.280]  police which was supposed to be secret so but i i have to say one thing that
[02:43:23.280 --> 02:43:28.720]  the the thing is it's the hierarchy that forces these men to do it like their
[02:43:28.720 --> 02:43:31.440]  quotas and these guys as they said to me
[02:43:31.440 --> 02:43:35.600]  you know frank uh i mean it might be rationalizing but they say
[02:43:35.600 --> 02:43:39.840]  you know we got our jobs are home we have to pay the mortgage
[02:43:39.840 --> 02:43:45.680]  so they are the victims uh but they just have to be strong enough but how you're
[02:43:45.680 --> 02:43:50.720]  going to do it when they hold the ax over you i wrote an article about 9 11 for
[02:43:50.720 --> 02:43:54.080]  chronogram chronogram magazine way back when i don't
[02:43:54.080 --> 02:43:59.440]  remember all the names and stuff now but about the iron triangle and that the
[02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:04.640]  night before 9 11 you know uh ben laden's uh i
[02:44:04.640 --> 02:44:08.400]  think it was his brother and all these heads of state
[02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:14.800]  had this meeting at uh i forget what which hotel it was here it was the rich
[02:44:14.800 --> 02:44:17.360]  carlton rich carlton yeah you know that was in the
[02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:21.840]  london guardian right yeah the bush and all the bin laden's and then only they
[02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:25.280]  were allowed to leave the country on the day of 9 11 when all the air traffic
[02:44:25.280 --> 02:44:29.680]  was shut down that's confirmed yes yeah so wasn't that a coincidence
[02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:35.200]  yeah yeah no i mean they blew it sky high yeah it's it's it's a fact and then
[02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:42.800]  this other character uh juliani uh rudy juliani you know there's
[02:44:42.800 --> 02:44:46.720]  you know there still is hope for democracy in america i gotta say that
[02:44:46.720 --> 02:44:50.080]  because there's this street artist and his name is
[02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:53.920]  uh no relation to the show host it's not
[02:44:53.920 --> 02:44:58.240]  i think it's dave uh i uh something
[02:44:58.240 --> 02:45:02.320]  robert letterman or something but anyway he was a street artist
[02:45:02.320 --> 02:45:06.880]  and he would make um paintings of juliani and he would cry them
[02:45:06.880 --> 02:45:13.280]  ate off juliani with a mustache and uh things like that juliani the mayor of
[02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:17.760]  new york had him arrested 41 times
[02:45:17.760 --> 02:45:21.520]  and this street artist managed to beat him
[02:45:21.520 --> 02:45:25.440]  every time so there are some good judges out there
[02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:28.720]  and they have to inspire the others we have to
[02:45:28.720 --> 02:45:33.520]  you know uh there was a quote i was looking for here from
[02:45:33.520 --> 02:45:37.600]  from cicero you know about the diligence the
[02:45:37.600 --> 02:45:42.400]  um um you're talking about the heights of the roman empire you were building
[02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:46.000]  it up we had to go to break right right um
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:53.280]  but there's the i lost i lost the um the the uh the the quote
[02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:59.520]  but in the end he says and who shall say we are worthy of mayor so
[02:45:59.520 --> 02:46:02.960]  you know you can't blame nobody if you sit on your laurels
[02:46:02.960 --> 02:46:06.640]  and uh and you don't do uh don't do anything about it
[02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:10.480]  um so the people you know they're strengthen numbers
[02:46:10.480 --> 02:46:14.880]  but he says the liberty is established by law
[02:46:14.880 --> 02:46:19.280]  we must be vigilant for liberty to enslave us
[02:46:19.280 --> 02:46:26.240]  is always present under that very liberty how constitution speaks
[02:46:26.240 --> 02:46:31.120]  of the general welfare of the people under that phrase
[02:46:31.120 --> 02:46:34.960]  all sorts of successes can be employed by
[02:46:34.960 --> 02:46:41.360]  lasting tyrants to make us bondsmen so
[02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:47.600]  that doesn't say at all um you know i i don't know what does you know and uh
[02:46:47.600 --> 02:46:53.920]  um so uh anyway and of course cicero really helped promote the idea
[02:46:53.920 --> 02:46:56.720]  i don't know how much time we have but it's uh
[02:46:56.720 --> 02:47:03.360]  always a pleasure talking to you and uh and uh visiting uh your website uh
[02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:07.440]  about our our great pope and all the work he did
[02:47:07.440 --> 02:47:10.800]  and uh you know that's that's the opiate of the masses
[02:47:10.800 --> 02:47:15.280]  uh you know as i said before you know the pope the queen uh
[02:47:15.280 --> 02:47:22.080]  you know these rock stars the they had the labels inside your
[02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:29.040]  your clothes you know it's um the corporations that uh make plans
[02:47:29.040 --> 02:47:33.760]  out of the public and um you know telling you uh
[02:47:33.760 --> 02:47:38.000]  then you then you see these guys uh these uh
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:41.440]  television guys are on public television and uh
[02:47:41.440 --> 02:47:45.840]  they put a brand new suit every time and and the commissioner too in new york
[02:47:45.840 --> 02:47:49.200]  city thousand dollar suit hundred dollar ties
[02:47:49.200 --> 02:47:52.480]  you know they're setting a good example for
[02:47:52.480 --> 02:47:57.200]  um you know tightening your belt what do you think about
[02:47:57.200 --> 02:48:00.960]  eric holder from my research he was intimately involved in Oklahoma city
[02:48:00.960 --> 02:48:05.040]  and in the cover-up and it's in federal court it was even in the Chicago
[02:48:05.040 --> 02:48:09.040]  Tribune and El Paso times that the drug cartels
[02:48:09.040 --> 02:48:13.600]  sinola got caught with five tons they're in court and the feds come in and go
[02:48:13.600 --> 02:48:17.280]  yeah it's national security we authorize them to bring the
[02:48:17.280 --> 02:48:19.600]  drugs in and then it happened with a bunch of other
[02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:23.840]  cartels and then we found out that they're giving guns to gangs all over
[02:48:23.840 --> 02:48:30.480]  the u.s but also overseas i mean it's just they are nothing but total gangsters
[02:48:30.480 --> 02:48:34.320]  who you're talking about the government is uh
[02:48:34.320 --> 02:48:42.000]  is exactly that the thing is um um they we never would even
[02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:48.160]  probably heard about uh what happened in Mexico that wasn't for the killing of
[02:48:48.160 --> 02:48:53.120]  the federal agent you know they say nothing of the
[02:48:53.120 --> 02:48:59.440]  200 other Mexicans that were slaughtered uh so you know
[02:48:59.440 --> 02:49:04.400]  body count doesn't mean anything to uh two people
[02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:08.080]  that are running the show you know it's collateral damage uh
[02:49:08.080 --> 02:49:15.600]  and um so that's why uh you know uh the NAACP says here in their letter
[02:49:15.600 --> 02:49:22.000]  to however it says um the NAAC supports accountability and
[02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:26.960]  transparency at every level fine but they say however this crusade in
[02:49:26.960 --> 02:49:31.360]  Congress reeks of partisan politics well i want to
[02:49:31.360 --> 02:49:35.760]  say what does this letter wreak up you know and so everybody's using words

[02:54:24.960 --> 02:54:28.720]  166 we're going to him first had about four or five minutes left with frank
[02:54:28.720 --> 02:54:32.880]  serpica what a legend like he said we've got to inspire other people
[02:54:32.880 --> 02:54:35.920]  and he gave the examples of how he inspired people and never knew he was
[02:54:35.920 --> 02:54:38.960]  doing it i know he certainly inspired me i was
[02:54:38.960 --> 02:54:43.520]  growing up as a child i'm only 38 i was probably like 12 years old or
[02:54:43.520 --> 02:54:49.520]  something my dad uh you know we went and rented serpica and
[02:54:49.520 --> 02:54:54.240]  popped it in the vcr or it was on i don't know hbo or something i don't
[02:54:54.240 --> 02:54:57.680]  remember i think we had cable when i was 12 the point is i remember being a
[02:54:57.680 --> 02:55:00.800]  little kid with my dad watching it my dad going this is a true story
[02:55:00.800 --> 02:55:04.880]  and then i started noticing a few years later that the police were dealing
[02:55:04.880 --> 02:55:07.680]  drugs where i lived outside dallas and then
[02:55:07.680 --> 02:55:11.280]  still pulling people over and harassing them and i'd be like
[02:55:11.280 --> 02:55:14.800]  you deal drugs what are you doing asking if i have drugs i don't use drugs
[02:55:14.800 --> 02:55:17.760]  i'll kill you kids you're going to jail you know
[02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:21.360]  dragging me out of the car where i was riding to school with older kids and
[02:55:21.360 --> 02:55:24.960]  take me to jail and and they told my dad through
[02:55:24.960 --> 02:55:28.480]  our lawyer because he got contacted and they said we're going to kill your son
[02:55:28.480 --> 02:55:32.400]  if he doesn't shut up but then later the sheriff got busted
[02:55:32.400 --> 02:55:37.280]  shipping cocaine in by the fbi who are a bunch of drug dealers too at the top
[02:55:37.280 --> 02:55:42.000]  frank briefly uh you wanted to make some comments uh i forget about what we were
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:45.920]  talking during the break what was our kissinger oh yeah kissinger go ahead
[02:55:45.920 --> 02:55:49.760]  i mean it's just a classic example how these
[02:55:49.760 --> 02:55:53.520]  you know terrible people are held up by our government
[02:55:53.520 --> 02:55:57.520]  as the good people you know as examples and uh
[02:55:57.520 --> 02:56:02.080]  the other day uh i i don't know how old it was on the internet
[02:56:02.080 --> 02:56:05.760]  uh some journalists claimed he saw
[02:56:05.760 --> 02:56:10.080]  kissinger being groped you know and uh no no no kissinger admitted that happened
[02:56:10.080 --> 02:56:13.520]  at the airport yeah well the thing is i was saying
[02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:18.720]  well they had a right to maybe uh he did have a weapon of mass destruction on
[02:56:18.720 --> 02:56:24.240]  him you know because he is a terrorist but anyway when i went to see the blog
[02:56:24.240 --> 02:56:28.480]  i was um pleased to see all the comments
[02:56:28.480 --> 02:56:32.240]  that the people were making back and forth you know the people know that he
[02:56:32.240 --> 02:56:36.000]  was a uh a war criminal you know and
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:40.560]  one said winning the novel prize is not hard when you are one of the founding
[02:56:40.560 --> 02:56:47.600]  members of the build apart xion club you know and you know comments like that so
[02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:50.960]  people are aware you know they're not asleep and i'm saying
[02:56:50.960 --> 02:56:56.000]  this is all uh due to the internet where people can uh
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:00.000]  you know reach uh millions of people around the world
[02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:04.800]  anyway in the words of james madison he said no nation could preserve its
[02:57:04.800 --> 02:57:08.480]  freedom in the midst of continual warfare
[02:57:08.480 --> 02:57:11.600]  and that's where we're in now continual warfare
[02:57:11.600 --> 02:57:17.040]  and um and uh how much time do we have because i like to close with the words
[02:57:17.040 --> 02:57:23.200]  of uh lewis d brandy's uh who was a specular humanist
[02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:27.040]  and uh i think uh wasn't he also in the court
[02:57:27.040 --> 02:57:30.960]  um lewis d brandy's sure go ahead we got about a minute
[02:57:30.960 --> 02:57:34.720]  he says we can have democracy in this country
[02:57:34.720 --> 02:57:39.280]  or we can have great wealth in the hands of a few
[02:57:39.280 --> 02:57:42.720]  but we can't have both

[03:00:56.160 --> 03:00:59.840]  with a guest talking or listening to a caller reading an article and something
[03:00:59.840 --> 03:01:03.680]  will click i'll go wait a minute we haven't had wane madson on in like
[03:01:03.680 --> 03:01:08.480]  two three months but four or five interviews ago i don't know five six
[03:01:08.480 --> 03:01:11.840]  months ago or longer i know a year ago or so
[03:01:11.840 --> 03:01:17.360]  he was he said i have a federal informant you know they're being tracked
[03:01:17.360 --> 03:01:20.800]  gifords was shot but roll was the main target and then i later had separate
[03:01:20.800 --> 03:01:24.880]  sources that confirmed that was part of the fast and furious cover-up
[03:01:24.880 --> 03:01:27.840]  and then i remember madson was on whenever it was four or five months ago
[03:01:27.840 --> 03:01:32.560]  was talking about their reportedly wiretaps of the attorney general
[03:01:32.560 --> 03:01:35.760]  he broke that i don't even remembers that he has such good sources
[03:01:35.760 --> 03:01:38.720]  you'll watch any national security hearing in congress you'll see wane
[03:01:38.720 --> 03:01:42.080]  madson back during the audience he was an anti-submarine warfare and then he
[03:01:42.080 --> 03:01:47.120]  worked for the nsa rca a lot of other agencies and groups
[03:01:47.120 --> 03:01:51.120]  and uh i'm not trying to to his horn it's just a fact that
[03:01:51.120 --> 03:01:54.000]  so much of what he says is so groundbreaking and then it and then it
[03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:57.520]  just kind of gets put out there and nothing ever even gets
[03:01:57.520 --> 03:02:01.120]  you know done with the information but i thought let's get him on with all his
[03:02:01.120 --> 03:02:04.400]  new intel on fast and furious and and wane
[03:02:04.400 --> 03:02:08.240]  you know we cover so much we hardly even never double back to it but
[03:02:08.240 --> 03:02:12.320]  when was that interview that you were bringing up big stuff on fast and furious
[03:02:12.320 --> 03:02:16.400]  and there are reported wiretaps because i remember you saying that do you
[03:02:16.400 --> 03:02:19.520]  remember saying that oh certainly i think it was about
[03:02:19.520 --> 03:02:24.720]  three months ago or something like that um i had an fbi confidential
[03:02:24.720 --> 03:02:29.680]  informant uh tell me that uh look this whole thing had to do with guns
[03:02:29.680 --> 03:02:33.280]  coming from mexico going to mexico across
[03:02:33.280 --> 03:02:37.840]  especially the arizona mexico border and uh judge roll and
[03:02:37.840 --> 03:02:41.360]  congresswoman gifords were actually having meetings
[03:02:41.360 --> 03:02:45.920]  in phoenix about what to do with this situation
[03:02:45.920 --> 03:02:50.000]  so this nutcase shows up at a campaign stop and
[03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:53.520]  tries to kill both of them gets the judge and um
[03:02:53.520 --> 03:02:57.120]  you know severely injures gifords to the point where she
[03:02:57.120 --> 03:03:01.040]  uh could not stay in congress anymore
[03:03:01.040 --> 03:03:04.880]  yeah and and the reason i asked what it was is we've i think the last time i
[03:03:04.880 --> 03:03:08.000]  interviewed you was was about three months ago
[03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:12.320]  but there was an interview before that i think it's longer than
[03:03:12.320 --> 03:03:16.160]  wasn't it about six months ago because because i've got a bunch of interviews
[03:03:16.160 --> 03:03:19.280]  with you i want to go find it and then play it on the nightly news tonight to
[03:03:19.280 --> 03:03:23.040]  point out that you broke this right well you know there's
[03:03:23.040 --> 03:03:26.880]  there's a lot more to this than meets the eye i have a story up
[03:03:26.880 --> 03:03:31.120]  on my website today about the fact that there are now
[03:03:31.120 --> 03:03:38.320]  investigations of weapon smuggling by various state national guard personnel
[03:03:38.320 --> 03:03:42.480]  there's a huge investigation now going on in california
[03:03:42.480 --> 03:03:46.480]  and uh what you brought that up three months ago and now that's in the news
[03:03:46.480 --> 03:03:49.680]  right here's what i want to do i want to go to break come back and have you
[03:03:49.680 --> 03:03:53.200]  start over because some stations don't carry the segment most do
[03:03:53.200 --> 03:03:56.800]  start over with your informant what they told you because for those that just
[03:03:56.800 --> 03:03:59.760]  joined us it's now the big headline out there roll call
[03:03:59.760 --> 03:04:04.480]  reporting that ishub who's got his own past
[03:04:04.480 --> 03:04:08.240]  was reading into the record that indeed what the examiner
[03:04:08.240 --> 03:04:13.520]  said back in early july is indeed true that there is and all this is up at
[03:04:13.520 --> 03:04:15.920]  info wars dot com right now the roll call
[03:04:15.920 --> 03:04:20.000]  of it also the the link to the examiner and the rest of it
[03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:25.440]  that that that these wiretaps exist to the attorney general
[03:04:25.440 --> 03:04:29.760]  and so now that's confirmed is the point and then i was just remembering
[03:04:29.760 --> 03:04:33.920]  that you had said wane and one of the interviews that oh they already had all
[03:04:33.920 --> 03:04:36.880]  the proof and wiretaps that your source had told you which gives more
[03:04:36.880 --> 03:04:40.000]  credibility to what they said about the other issue so i was just remembering i
[03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:43.280]  heard this first from you so let's codify your thoughts on that subject
[03:04:43.280 --> 03:04:46.400]  because i know i just sprung this on you just called you and then we'll get your
[03:04:46.400 --> 03:04:58.480]  take on it straight ahead stay with us
[03:04:58.480 --> 03:05:03.200]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide
[03:05:03.200 --> 03:05:08.480]  it's alex jones
[03:05:08.480 --> 03:05:17.760]  i'm alex jones
[03:05:18.640 --> 03:05:24.880]  we are live it is friday 29th day of june 2012
[03:05:24.880 --> 03:05:27.680]  your calls are coming up for those have been patiently holding
[03:05:27.680 --> 03:05:31.600]  like dean and tennessee listing on xm 166 and others
[03:05:31.600 --> 03:05:36.000]  uh fast and furious is blowing wide open the nightmare
[03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:39.680]  uh obama care written by the insurance companies to rip everybody off is in
[03:05:39.680 --> 03:05:42.080]  place it's all going to get broken down here
[03:05:42.080 --> 03:05:45.520]  but they've got him in contempt but i mean holger is just the front man for
[03:05:45.520 --> 03:05:49.440]  all this investigative journalist wane madson
[03:05:49.440 --> 03:05:54.240]  of wane madson report dot com was on the nightly news
[03:05:54.240 --> 03:05:57.600]  about six months ago and then he reiterated this about three months ago
[03:05:57.600 --> 03:06:01.680]  last time he was on with us that judge roll had been shot to cover up
[03:06:01.680 --> 03:06:06.080]  gun running through arizona into mexico and since then
[03:06:06.080 --> 03:06:08.960]  you know news has come out that these different towns and cities were involved
[03:06:08.960 --> 03:06:12.640]  not just from texas from west texas all the way to arizona
[03:06:12.640 --> 03:06:16.560]  and and that that had been really a hit he has a federal uh confidential
[03:06:16.560 --> 03:06:19.280]  informant he formally worked of course with the nsa he's a great
[03:06:19.280 --> 03:06:21.760]  investigative journalist but i remember in the interview we're
[03:06:21.760 --> 03:06:25.040]  talking about oh they they've got proof in congress i'm
[03:06:25.040 --> 03:06:28.800]  told they're wiretaps so i remember you talking about that
[03:06:28.800 --> 03:06:32.720]  so so recap because that means you were the first person i know of to break
[03:06:32.720 --> 03:06:36.160]  these wiretaps that issa has now read into the record
[03:06:36.160 --> 03:06:39.120]  that indeed there were confidential wiretaps
[03:06:39.120 --> 03:06:42.720]  uh of people in the justice department or proving that they knew
[03:06:42.720 --> 03:06:46.240]  and were directing this i mean this is amazing
[03:06:46.240 --> 03:06:49.520]  uh i mean tell us what's really going on here and how deep
[03:06:49.520 --> 03:06:55.600]  fast and furious goes well nsa has for some time had the authority to
[03:06:55.600 --> 03:07:00.000]  uh listen and eavesdrop on the phone conversations and now the email of
[03:07:00.000 --> 03:07:04.560]  course of any government official including the attorney general now
[03:07:04.560 --> 03:07:07.760]  they do that for communication security purposes
[03:07:07.760 --> 03:07:10.720]  but it's obvious that they're wiretapping and they
[03:07:10.720 --> 03:07:14.800]  uncover any kind of information especially that which may
[03:07:14.800 --> 03:07:18.160]  involve a foreign intelligence operation
[03:07:18.160 --> 03:07:22.160]  they will maintain those wiretaps um and um
[03:07:22.160 --> 03:07:28.240]  certainly nsa would be very interested in anything having to do with
[03:07:28.240 --> 03:07:34.000]  shipping guns to two of the worst drug cartels the very bloody
[03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:37.760]  and violent zetas and sineloa cartels in mexico
[03:07:37.760 --> 03:07:41.280]  but now we have a royal canadian mount a police report
[03:07:41.280 --> 03:07:47.360]  came out not long ago about guns being shipped up interstate 75
[03:07:47.360 --> 03:07:53.040]  from as far south as florida into ontario uh so it's not just mexico it's
[03:07:53.040 --> 03:07:56.720]  canada and a couple weeks ago a national guard member in
[03:07:56.720 --> 03:08:01.840]  north carolina was arrested he was with special operations for special forces
[03:08:01.840 --> 03:08:07.040]  for the north carolina national guard was arrested for shipping guns into china
[03:08:07.040 --> 03:08:12.400]  into 16 cities and provinces in china uh and the fbi and the ministry of public
[03:08:12.400 --> 03:08:15.840]  security in beijing jointly busted that operation
[03:08:15.840 --> 03:08:20.160]  so uh it looks like guns are being shipped out of the united states
[03:08:20.160 --> 03:08:24.880]  mexico china for the purpose of destabilization that would be a
[03:08:24.880 --> 03:08:29.360]  foreign that would be and they've been catching navy seal shipping hang grenades
[03:08:29.360 --> 03:08:32.960]  and guns that you don't get at a gun shop into mexico a few months ago you
[03:08:32.960 --> 03:08:37.280]  talked about the special forces army veterans
[03:08:37.280 --> 03:08:41.280]  uh a gang of black guys were caught shipping them into mexico
[03:08:41.280 --> 03:08:45.280]  and and drugs back in i mean this is just massive what's going on
[03:08:45.280 --> 03:08:48.640]  so so tell us about the wiretaps though because
[03:08:48.640 --> 03:08:52.400]  i remember you being the first person was like out of the blue
[03:08:52.400 --> 03:08:56.800]  and i'm like wow there's wiretaps i mean how did you get that i mean
[03:08:56.800 --> 03:09:00.560]  who was i mean not who was your source but i mean what did they tell you
[03:09:00.560 --> 03:09:06.880]  well as i said nsa uh always listens into the communications
[03:09:06.880 --> 03:09:10.400]  of government officials and now they have even more authority under
[03:09:10.400 --> 03:09:16.400]  intelligence directive 700 which was issued by a former general
[03:09:16.400 --> 03:09:20.240]  tire general james clapper the director national intelligence after the leaks on
[03:09:20.240 --> 03:09:25.600]  the white house kill list for the drone attacks and also the
[03:09:25.600 --> 03:09:28.560]  flame malware virus that infected iranian
[03:09:28.560 --> 03:09:31.680]  computing systems now they have even more authority
[03:09:31.680 --> 03:09:35.920]  to do wiretaps of government officials to plug leaks essentially that's what
[03:09:35.920 --> 03:09:39.680]  it's about so but they've had this for quite some time so
[03:09:39.680 --> 03:09:45.040]  again uh the information is that uh holder and especially the people under
[03:09:45.040 --> 03:09:50.320]  him uh were being listened in on uh ostensibly for
[03:09:50.320 --> 03:09:53.840]  communication security but we know after the bush administration
[03:09:53.840 --> 03:09:57.200]  that's just a mantra that's used to cover up
[03:09:57.200 --> 03:10:00.400]  listening in on government officials it was done to call in power
[03:10:00.400 --> 03:10:04.080]  he was secretary of state and it was done to several others when you were
[03:10:04.080 --> 03:10:07.360]  doing that say i mean i know you were compartmentalized but you worked in
[03:10:07.360 --> 03:10:12.000]  some highly classified areas i know uh from bios i've seen out there
[03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:18.800]  i mean what was the level of spying then compared to what it is now
[03:10:18.800 --> 03:10:23.200]  well it's it wasn't there were rules in place uh not to just
[03:10:23.200 --> 03:10:27.440]  conduct surveillance merely for political intelligence purposes
[03:10:27.440 --> 03:10:31.040]  but that all changed after 9 11 now anything's fair game
[03:10:31.040 --> 03:10:35.440]  but even before 9 11 uh there was nsa documents to show that
[03:10:35.440 --> 03:10:39.840]  when she was first lady hillary clinton was being eavesdropped upon
[03:10:39.840 --> 03:10:43.920]  for some of her international uh uh operation she was in
[03:10:43.920 --> 03:10:48.560]  involved with and also uh former president jimmy carter
[03:10:48.560 --> 03:10:52.240]  was being eavesdropped upon when he was trying to negotiate a peace
[03:10:52.240 --> 03:10:56.720]  settlement in bosnia his phone calls were listening in on when he was in
[03:10:56.720 --> 03:11:00.320]  sariebo the bosnian capital but now it's much worse now
[03:11:00.320 --> 03:11:06.080]  now uh all you need is uh uh they've got blanket authority
[03:11:06.080 --> 03:11:09.600]  basically to eavesdrop on on anyone and that would include of course the
[03:11:09.600 --> 03:11:13.200]  president states again for communication security what does it
[03:11:13.200 --> 03:11:16.320]  signify because obviously there were gun-running scandals
[03:11:16.320 --> 03:11:23.120]  before uh and and normally if holder played the card that i predicted he
[03:11:23.120 --> 03:11:27.200]  would that hey bush did some gun-running scandals as well
[03:11:27.200 --> 03:11:31.280]  normally that would make him back off but issa and the republicans aren't
[03:11:31.280 --> 03:11:35.920]  which i say is a good thing overall but what type of war is going on what's
[03:11:35.920 --> 03:11:40.000]  happening right now in washington well let's see how far is so we'll go
[03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:45.120]  because back when uh blackwater uh was under investigation in 07 when
[03:11:45.120 --> 03:11:48.800]  henry waxman was chairman of the same committee that is his
[03:11:48.800 --> 03:11:53.920]  chairman of now um issa was a big defender of blackwater now we
[03:11:53.920 --> 03:11:57.600]  and that was at the time when some blackwater x blackwater employees were
[03:11:57.600 --> 03:12:02.160]  arrested for smuggling weapons uh from the united states into iraq
[03:12:02.160 --> 03:12:07.360]  and issa came to eric prince uh the chair uh ceo of blackwater came to his
[03:12:07.360 --> 03:12:11.680]  defense and said this was a a political witch hunt against blackwater
[03:12:11.680 --> 03:12:17.440]  but if if he is aware now of other information um and he actually
[03:12:17.440 --> 03:12:21.520]  lettered last year to the white house saying hey look some of waxman's
[03:12:21.520 --> 03:12:25.440]  questions were never answered i'm not happy with that i want to answer so
[03:12:25.440 --> 03:12:29.760]  he may be on to something but let's see how far he goes because i think this
[03:12:29.760 --> 03:12:34.960]  is a this is a uh intelligence operation probably a very compartmentalized
[03:12:34.960 --> 03:12:37.920]  operation that's allowing weapons to go into
[03:12:37.920 --> 03:12:43.520]  mexico china and now we know uh and it may be for purposes of political
[03:12:43.520 --> 03:12:47.120]  destabilization well no kidding i mean that's what
[03:12:47.120 --> 03:12:50.560]  celica still told us six years ago he said they're training people in south
[03:12:50.560 --> 03:12:54.160]  texas when calderon gets in the civil war is going to start
[03:12:54.160 --> 03:12:58.160]  it's meant to destabilize and knock out cartels controlled by the mexican
[03:12:58.160 --> 03:13:01.520]  government so the big banks can fully monopolize it but
[03:13:01.520 --> 03:13:05.840]  those mexican cartels allied uh with their own systems
[03:13:05.840 --> 03:13:11.840]  have been in many levels defeating the goldman sacks jp morgan
[03:13:11.840 --> 03:13:15.840]  wells fargo army by the way folks it's in uh if you're a new listener you're
[03:13:15.840 --> 03:13:19.040]  like well that's quite an accusation two years ago it was in bloomberg and
[03:13:19.040 --> 03:13:24.240]  associated press 376 billion laundered by wells fargo
[03:13:24.240 --> 03:13:29.120]  and guacovia in just a two-year period i mean obviously 500 billion a year in
[03:13:29.120 --> 03:13:32.080]  narcotics money into the u.s is not being hidden in the
[03:13:32.080 --> 03:13:37.680]  crackhouse uh closets or uh in their mattresses
[03:13:37.680 --> 03:13:41.280]  right and we have to remember we have a presidential election in mexico this
[03:13:41.280 --> 03:13:45.680]  sunday uh day after tomorrow where the institutional
[03:13:45.680 --> 03:13:49.840]  revolutionary party that ruled mexico for many years may come back into power
[03:13:49.840 --> 03:13:53.360]  and uh the presidential candidate has talked about coming to some
[03:13:53.360 --> 03:13:56.800]  sort of agreement with the cartels now obviously that's not
[03:13:56.800 --> 03:13:59.840]  uh music to the ears of the people in washington so
[03:13:59.840 --> 03:14:03.120]  there'd be a great uh interest in trying to keep things
[03:14:03.120 --> 03:14:06.400]  in mexico the way they are with the high level of
[03:14:06.400 --> 03:14:10.240]  terrible violence uh being committed beheadings and everything else but this
[03:14:10.240 --> 03:14:13.600]  has a link of course to the guns that are being
[03:14:13.600 --> 03:14:16.560]  shipped into mexico and were shipped under fast and furious
[03:14:16.560 --> 03:14:20.880]  and now we have uh information that uh governor brown in california governor
[03:14:20.880 --> 03:14:24.480]  perry in texas are both investigating and the involvement of their own
[03:14:24.480 --> 03:14:30.320]  national guards and weapons smuggling and embezzlement of national guard funds
[03:14:30.320 --> 03:14:33.440]  so it is getting crazy in the few minutes we've got left
[03:14:33.440 --> 03:14:37.840]  Wayne matz and you always drop big bomb shells on us any other tidbits that i
[03:14:37.840 --> 03:14:41.120]  haven't brought up that that that you think are important
[03:14:41.120 --> 03:14:44.560]  dealing with fast and furious and all the rest of this
[03:14:44.560 --> 03:14:48.160]  well i would just keep uh keep a close eye on
[03:14:48.160 --> 03:14:51.600]  what happens now obviously there's going to be a civil
[03:14:51.600 --> 03:14:55.440]  uh a civil charge a civil charge is filed
[03:14:55.440 --> 03:15:00.000]  with the contempt uh resolution uh the criminal
[03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:03.920]  thing won't go far because why would holder want to investigate himself
[03:15:03.920 --> 03:15:07.920]  it's it'll be referred to the u.s. attorney for the district to columbia
[03:15:07.920 --> 03:15:12.000]  but that individual works for eric holder so uh i think we won't see anything
[03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:14.880]  there the only way would see any investigation
[03:15:14.880 --> 03:15:18.320]  is to see the independent special counsel come back but that
[03:15:18.320 --> 03:15:21.600]  comes and goes depending on the political wins in washington
[03:15:21.600 --> 03:15:26.640]  we certainly had one during watergate we had one uh for uh whitewater so
[03:15:26.640 --> 03:15:30.000]  basically it's about political point scoring but if you get out of hand
[03:15:30.000 --> 03:15:33.360]  you're dead reckoning will obama go the way of nixon
[03:15:33.360 --> 03:15:37.040]  or does he have too much dirt on the other uh kleptocrats
[03:15:37.040 --> 03:15:41.760]  i think this is uh i think we talked about mexico but this is a mexican
[03:15:41.760 --> 03:15:45.920]  standoff uh basically uh they have the dirt on one another
[03:15:45.920 --> 03:15:50.000]  i don't think uh issa will really go that far
[03:15:50.000 --> 03:15:54.400]  if uh he starts to expose uh the involvement of people
[03:15:54.400 --> 03:15:58.080]  the cia and other agencies that may be involved in
[03:15:58.080 --> 03:16:03.760]  this weapons uh smuggling for uh intelligence uh covert operation
[03:16:03.760 --> 03:16:07.360]  purposes well sure i mean we already knew years ago eight
[03:16:07.360 --> 03:16:10.880]  agencies were involved it's drugs coming back in i mean that's in federal
[03:16:10.880 --> 03:16:15.360]  court uh and now we're seeing all the whitewash articles out there
[03:16:15.360 --> 03:16:18.720]  this is just another iran contra do you agree with that
[03:16:18.720 --> 03:16:22.880]  oh i think that's it and uh you know the problem is when the intelligence
[03:16:22.880 --> 03:16:26.080]  agencies get this kind of power which they have all that
[03:16:26.080 --> 03:16:29.360]  never had this much power in the past they're gonna abuse it they're gonna
[03:16:29.360 --> 03:16:32.720]  take advantage of it and we get you know the situation with
[03:16:32.720 --> 03:16:37.280]  embezzling funds like we saw during around connetra globalist one is is
[03:16:37.280 --> 03:16:40.480]  everybody corrupt wayne madson have a great weekend thank you so much for
[03:16:40.480 --> 03:16:43.040]  that report that would be the alley you bet
[03:16:43.040 --> 03:16:46.320]  wayne madson report dot com's his site info wars dot commas ours
[03:16:46.320 --> 03:16:49.840]  okay we're gonna go to dean quentin and others straight ahead stay with us your
[03:16:49.840 --> 03:17:06.240]  calls up next
[03:17:06.240 --> 03:17:09.840]  over at examiner dot com a terry webster
[03:17:09.840 --> 03:17:14.000]  has written a pretty good boil down article of the points i raise against
[03:17:14.000 --> 03:17:17.600]  government run nightmare health care it's called jones blast
[03:17:17.600 --> 03:17:21.440]  supreme court health care ruling i raise that because i just happened to see the
[03:17:21.440 --> 03:17:23.840]  article and read over it during the break
[03:17:23.840 --> 03:17:27.200]  and i noticed that a lady called earlier saying there should be a basic boil
[03:17:27.200 --> 03:17:29.440]  down and we've done those but here's a new one
[03:17:29.440 --> 03:17:32.800]  it goes over at all we'll get it linked up at info wars dot com
[03:17:32.800 --> 03:17:36.560]  let's go to dean and tennessee listing on xm 166 then quentin
[03:17:36.560 --> 03:17:41.280]  dean welcome thanks for holding now it's a pleasure to speak with you uh i'm
[03:17:41.280 --> 03:17:44.880]  calling me if you think the globalist may have shot themselves in the foot
[03:17:44.880 --> 03:17:50.240]  by calling obama care tax because all federal taxes are
[03:17:50.240 --> 03:17:53.520]  required to be originated in the house representatives
[03:17:53.520 --> 03:17:56.960]  so if obama care didn't originate in house representatives it should be
[03:17:56.960 --> 03:18:02.080]  deemed an illegal tax you know i knew one version of it originated in the
[03:18:02.080 --> 03:18:05.280]  senate but didn't they then change that and go back and get and change it in the
[03:18:05.280 --> 03:18:08.880]  house uh you know that's a good point i have to i have
[03:18:08.880 --> 03:18:14.240]  to look at that but i pardon me guys
[03:18:14.240 --> 03:18:18.000]  okay so so uh cj says he followed that i mean my memory was
[03:18:18.000 --> 03:18:22.640]  they did try that but then it went back to the house and they fully voted to
[03:18:22.640 --> 03:18:27.600]  basically go with that version uh but look taxes to be paid to private
[03:18:27.600 --> 03:18:31.120]  interest you know that's the issue they're saying you pay this to an
[03:18:31.120 --> 03:18:34.800]  insurance company or we come take your money
[03:18:34.800 --> 03:18:38.560]  uh and then they call that a tax it's it's
[03:18:38.560 --> 03:18:42.080]  look it's totally illegal it's classical tyranny
[03:18:42.080 --> 03:18:48.320]  on its face what do you say i i i'd say you need to go away
[03:18:48.320 --> 03:18:52.000]  immediately well here's the deal a bunch of republican governors say they're
[03:18:52.000 --> 03:18:56.000]  just going to ignore it and uh i mean the answer is if you
[03:18:56.000 --> 03:18:59.200]  can't ignore it see you got to choose your battles
[03:18:59.200 --> 03:19:02.320]  i've asked my crew over and over again and they don't want
[03:19:02.320 --> 03:19:05.280]  to get the health care they want the full amount of money they can get it if
[03:19:05.280 --> 03:19:08.960]  they want it under this i'm going to have to come up with some plan tell them
[03:19:08.960 --> 03:19:12.160]  what it is and then do it but but i have to choose my
[03:19:12.160 --> 03:19:16.000]  battles do i not get the insurance and get in a big lawsuit with the government
[03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:19.920]  and penalties and interest or do i fight them on all the other subjects
[03:19:19.920 --> 03:19:24.320]  uh but you roll over to this i mean you've got to choose your battles but
[03:19:24.320 --> 03:19:27.440]  i think the way to go with this is non-compliance at this point but we
[03:19:27.440 --> 03:19:30.960]  need to debate that thank you for the call let's talk to quentin in louis
[03:19:30.960 --> 03:19:33.920]  iguana you're on the air quentin
[03:19:33.920 --> 03:19:37.440]  reading dialects from the cashlist state of louis iguana where you could be
[03:19:37.440 --> 03:19:40.960]  arrested for buying something second hand with cash
[03:19:40.960 --> 03:19:44.720]  are you like that i've you know i i saw that last year and couldn't believe it
[03:19:44.720 --> 03:19:47.680]  and it's actually actually is the law you can't buy
[03:19:47.680 --> 03:19:50.800]  things second hand with cash you get arrested because you're a prisoner
[03:19:50.800 --> 03:19:56.720]  and prisoners can't be trusted to have lemonade stands or garage sales prisoner
[03:19:56.720 --> 03:20:01.520]  exactly alex uh first of all i totally disagree with obama care
[03:20:01.520 --> 03:20:05.280]  um the only thing that the american people to look forward to
[03:20:05.280 --> 03:20:08.960]  is just another deduction line on their on their checks the right under social
[03:20:08.960 --> 03:20:12.720]  security um free health care that's a total dream
[03:20:12.720 --> 03:20:16.720]  um second thing i want to get into is i have a message
[03:20:16.720 --> 03:20:20.000]  for the preachers of america or behind the pulpit
[03:20:20.000 --> 03:20:23.680]  that they need to stop preaching a watered down gospel
[03:20:23.680 --> 03:20:27.680]  and start preaching the true gospel of jesus christ and telling the american
[03:20:27.680 --> 03:20:32.000]  people and waking them up and stop all this nonsense
[03:20:32.000 --> 03:20:35.600]  i agree with you sir and even if we don't believe in god
[03:20:35.600 --> 03:20:40.160]  the issue is this is an immoral country people are acting like zombies and
[03:20:40.160 --> 03:20:43.680]  slobs myself included we need to recognize the
[03:20:43.680 --> 03:20:47.760]  good from the bad and try to be good but if you just say oh we're just animals
[03:20:47.760 --> 03:20:51.200]  there's no good or bad well now it's law of the jungle folks
[03:20:51.200 --> 03:20:54.480]  and that isn't pretty let's go to another caller here
[03:20:54.480 --> 03:20:58.160]  let's go ahead and speak to jake in origan you got about a minute and a
[03:20:58.160 --> 03:21:02.720]  half brother hey alex how you doing good
[03:21:02.720 --> 03:21:06.640]  hey uh i have a question uh what do you think will happen when mit romney
[03:21:06.640 --> 03:21:10.080]  if mit romney gets elected uh many people have told me that i might go to war
[03:21:10.080 --> 03:21:15.200]  because i'm uh young and i'll be uh that era
[03:21:15.200 --> 03:21:19.120]  i think if mit romney gets in the same special interest that financed obama
[03:21:19.120 --> 03:21:22.560]  will just continue but with a fresh pony people will be like but he's a
[03:21:22.560 --> 03:21:26.400]  republican why is it continuing because this is the agenda they want you know
[03:21:26.400 --> 03:21:30.240]  why did roberts he was a republican why did he flip why
