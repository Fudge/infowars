[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:20.860]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.860 --> 00:36.560]  well the jury in the Zimmerman Martin case murder trial they go to the
[00:36.560 --> 00:42.280]  Liberations as early as today and you've got the new Black Panther Party leader
[00:42.280 --> 00:47.380]  coming out saying go into white areas and burn down all their houses and
[00:47.380 --> 00:54.260]  basically kill everybody and he's not being arrested which guarantees him as
[00:54.260 --> 00:59.580]  a federal provocateur probably under the control of the Justice Department who
[00:59.580 --> 01:04.580]  day one has been caught organizing the demonstrations and the calls for violence
[01:04.580 --> 01:08.380]  if George Zimmerman is not found guilty
[01:09.300 --> 01:16.880]  obviously ladies and gentlemen there are some forces in the White House through
[01:16.880 --> 01:24.800]  the lifelong Democrat judge who is trying to get him convicted that that do
[01:24.800 --> 01:29.420]  want to see Zimmerman go to jail but at the same time there's also forces from
[01:29.420 --> 01:34.280]  the White House this is usually how the it works there's different camps that
[01:34.280 --> 01:39.620]  are trying to get a race war going in this nation so they can then bring
[01:39.620 --> 01:44.960]  Homeland Security out to quell the disorder as a pretext to have Americans
[01:44.960 --> 01:51.020]  accept more and more tyranny and further divide the country and you saw massive
[01:51.020 --> 01:57.280]  riots of course the LA riots over the situation with the Rodney King verdict
[01:57.280 --> 02:02.140]  this is truly disgusting while we have all these serious issues going on massive
[02:02.140 --> 02:07.660]  unemployment deindustrialization all of this incredible corruption happening
[02:07.660 --> 02:12.660]  foreign banks looting us the tune of $85 billion a month and all anyone wants to
[02:12.660 --> 02:17.160]  talk about and I don't blame them it's very interesting is the Zimmerman trial
[02:17.160 --> 02:22.080]  so we're going to be discussing that and about 40 minutes Larry Pinkney who is
[02:22.080 --> 02:27.960]  the head of information nationwide worldwide of the real Black Panther Party
[02:27.960 --> 02:31.920]  and who they've tried to put in prison over and over again on Trump's up
[02:31.920 --> 02:35.920]  garbage and that's even been declassified with Cohen tell pro he is
[02:35.920 --> 02:40.760]  going to be popping in the last 20 minutes of this hour to give us his take
[02:40.760 --> 02:44.760]  on it I don't know what his take is but he's a really smart guy he's been here
[02:44.760 --> 02:47.560]  before we interviewed him for a bomb deception to have interviewed him under
[02:47.560 --> 02:51.960]  the last decade quite a few times on air so I would imagine that he'll basically
[02:51.960 --> 02:57.920]  have the same take I have but this is unprecedented what's going on and and
[02:57.920 --> 03:03.080]  just like the white supremacist Hal Turner would call for violence and for
[03:03.080 --> 03:09.040]  whites to attack minorities and would call for attacks on judges I said that
[03:09.040 --> 03:13.960]  guy's a fed or he wouldn't be able to do that year after year and finally he got
[03:13.960 --> 03:18.800]  hacked it got released that he was a high-level FBI national security asset so
[03:18.800 --> 03:22.400]  then they burned their own asset and sent him to prison for threatening state
[03:22.400 --> 03:30.320]  judges the FBI came to trial since the Chicago Tribune by the way and said yeah
[03:30.320 --> 03:35.560]  it's true national security he works for us still still he got prosecuted and
[03:35.560 --> 03:39.480]  went to jail even though the FBI came in and said yeah here's the national
[03:39.480 --> 03:43.720]  security letter he was a highest level national security asset and then they
[03:43.720 --> 03:49.360]  talked to the judge privately and still sent Turner to prison now if you're
[03:49.360 --> 03:54.560]  informed I said for a decade on air that he was a fed I mean that's like saying a
[03:54.560 --> 03:58.360]  duck as a duck swimming around at the local park you know in a pond I mean
[03:58.360 --> 04:02.240]  it's not hard or the Sun's in the sky there's the Sun he would constantly say
[04:02.240 --> 04:07.840]  that I was a work for Israel he would constantly say that I you know it was
[04:07.840 --> 04:13.080]  blah blah blah that I needed to be dealt with when when when none of that was
[04:13.080 --> 04:19.160]  true I mean I know a fed when I see one and of course he was a fed and I'm
[04:19.160 --> 04:25.200]  telling you I'm telling you these black panther guys the new black panther
[04:25.200 --> 04:31.080]  party that's just basically like a black supremacist group probably doesn't work
[04:31.080 --> 04:34.520]  for the FBI because I've learned the different groups they work directly for
[04:34.520 --> 04:38.720]  the White House and directly for probably a group like the Ford Foundation or
[04:38.720 --> 04:43.560]  Southern Barber Law Center if I had to guess the from past operations we've
[04:43.560 --> 04:49.240]  seen somebody this dangerous and it's getting away with this well it's like
[04:49.240 --> 04:52.760]  the Southern Barber Law Center was running Elohim city that McVeigh was it
[04:52.760 --> 04:57.120]  that came out in court documents I mean this this guy's super high level

[08:23.400 --> 08:34.200]  GCN radio network ladies and gentlemen it is Friday the 12th day of July 2013
[08:34.200 --> 08:41.600]  I'll also be back this Sunday this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. Central and of course
[08:41.600 --> 08:46.520]  Monday we'll have live continued coverage of whatever happens with the
[08:46.520 --> 08:54.600]  Zimmerman Trayvon Martin murder case out in Florida the judge is a Democratic
[08:54.600 --> 08:59.240]  Party operative that's on record we'll go over those articles today the judge is
[08:59.240 --> 09:05.720]  trying to prejudice the jury every way she can and telling because I believe
[09:05.720 --> 09:14.600]  evidence shows the jury because I believe evidence shows the jury is going
[09:14.600 --> 09:21.720]  to do the right thing and acquit Mr. Zimmerman there is political pressure
[09:21.720 --> 09:30.320]  to convict him for race relations so so I guess getting rid of justice means it
[09:30.320 --> 09:35.520]  will help quote race relations no this is really about demonizing the right to
[09:35.520 --> 09:39.840]  self-defense and I've said this about a hundred times I think Zimmerman was
[09:39.840 --> 09:45.120]  stupid to follow Trayvon Martin around and I think Trayvon Martin from all the
[09:45.120 --> 09:51.720]  evidence was as dumb as well to jump on top of him and start slamming his head
[09:51.720 --> 09:57.000]  into the concrete but when somebody walks up to you with a gun in their hand
[09:57.000 --> 10:02.320]  and says what are you doing I mean when I was 17 18 years old I would have
[10:02.320 --> 10:08.280]  definitely malved off to the person and again that's why Zimmerman was older
[10:08.280 --> 10:11.920]  he should have been more a more intelligent about the fact to not go
[10:11.920 --> 10:16.800]  following somebody around who you think is suspicious unless they're on your
[10:16.800 --> 10:22.920]  property and still I would just open the door and say get off my property
[10:22.920 --> 10:26.480]  because I don't want to just shoot somebody that's a deal with all the
[10:26.480 --> 10:32.360]  repercussions from it so I think Zimmerman was in the wrong and negligent
[10:32.360 --> 10:36.640]  in his behavior but that does not deserve a manslaughter or a higher charge
[10:36.640 --> 10:43.440]  of murder it certainly wasn't premeditated he certainly was begging
[10:43.440 --> 10:47.800]  for his life being brutally assaulted having his head driven into the concrete
[10:47.800 --> 10:54.360]  and so I'm done talking about that this is a totally political diversion I'm
[10:54.360 --> 10:57.240]  done talking about what happened there with the case the evidence is
[10:57.240 --> 11:03.480]  overwhelming this is a witch hunt and the White House and Obama from day one
[11:03.480 --> 11:08.320]  has has made it racial saying Trayvon looks like the son I never had and
[11:08.320 --> 11:14.480]  invoking that and the Justice Department on record they're spending
[11:14.480 --> 11:18.880]  thousands of dollars a day last year with operatives and that's just what we
[11:18.880 --> 11:24.280]  know about on the ground trying to drum up demonstrations and trying to make it
[11:24.280 --> 11:29.040]  a Democrat Republican white versus black issue the Democratic Party has always
[11:29.040 --> 11:34.560]  been about race politics they are the experts in it they ran much of the
[11:34.560 --> 11:38.200]  country not just the south but the west and the north in many areas they were
[11:38.200 --> 11:42.480]  the dominant party based on race and then when the demographics swung and
[11:42.480 --> 11:46.240]  they saw that change coming because mainly white Christians would not be
[11:46.240 --> 11:49.720]  part of segregation and racism anymore whites were you know 80% of the
[11:49.720 --> 11:54.520]  population they went with that and then started race politics from a from the
[11:54.520 --> 11:58.840]  other perspective and that's why they fund the Hispanic Ku Klux Klan groups
[11:58.840 --> 12:03.040]  of Metsha and La Raza and the new Black Panther Party and all the rest of it and
[12:03.040 --> 12:10.520]  we have the former head of the Black Panthers communications one of the first
[12:10.520 --> 12:14.720]  people you know when it was first founded Larry Pinkney will be joining us
[12:14.720 --> 12:19.360]  of the real Black Panther Party that the feds came in and took over and the feds
[12:19.360 --> 12:23.520]  put out fake racist comic books showing black folks killing white police
[12:23.520 --> 12:27.960]  officers and things to then demonize the group we have some of those articles
[12:27.960 --> 12:34.520]  up on infoworks.com today to then get rid of a real liberation group and bring
[12:34.520 --> 12:38.280]  in the synthetic fake one which is the new Black Panther Party and let me get
[12:38.280 --> 12:46.080]  to that right now before I get to the latest on the case Wayne Madsen will be
[12:46.080 --> 12:53.640]  joining us today in studio formerly with the NSA and Wayne really opened up to
[12:53.640 --> 12:57.200]  me last night about some of the stuff he's been involved in he's more than
[12:57.200 --> 13:03.720]  just somebody that worked at the NSA very interesting international freelance
[13:03.720 --> 13:09.840]  journalist spy I guess you could call it he was telling me about infiltrating
[13:09.840 --> 13:14.560]  countries with British intelligence and stuff last night was pretty wild but
[13:14.560 --> 13:17.760]  everything he's talked about by the way has been demonized for months later
[13:17.760 --> 13:22.680]  years later or weeks later the last few months as then comes out CNN was
[13:22.680 --> 13:28.640]  demonizing him on Sunday with their stupid reliable sources show run by a
[13:28.640 --> 13:32.320]  bunch of White House operatives saying oh it's ridiculous he says that the
[13:32.320 --> 13:35.360]  Europe works for the US and spying and then it all comes out and is confirmed
[13:35.360 --> 13:38.360]  it's ridiculous we're tapping the transatlantic cable and then that all
[13:38.360 --> 13:42.400]  comes out the next day it's ridiculous that they were countering stuff he'd
[13:42.400 --> 13:46.640]  said two weeks before on my show and just on and on and on they're like it's
[13:46.640 --> 13:53.640]  ridiculous he says the Sun comes up so that's gonna be coming up and then
[13:53.640 --> 13:59.080]  James O'Keeffe has got a new book out you know they had up the Veritas project
[13:59.080 --> 14:05.840]  which really is the Bible from my view on how to create your own activist media
[14:05.840 --> 14:10.320]  organization that'll really damage the New World Order and because they're
[14:10.320 --> 14:15.880]  mafia in your town in your state globalist to Jenna 21 Democratic Party
[14:15.880 --> 14:22.560]  especially they are just down and dirty gangsters and the book is available at
[14:22.560 --> 14:28.120]  infowarstore.com it's breakthrough and let me tell you you know I've been
[14:28.120 --> 14:30.680]  doing this longer than these guys have been doing it but I don't do it as well
[14:30.680 --> 14:34.840]  as they do and let me tell you you can look at we are changed you can look at
[14:34.840 --> 14:39.400]  breakthrough you can look at the work I've done as an activist journalist an
[14:39.400 --> 14:43.960]  investigative journalism I'm telling you folks this is the book to get people
[14:43.960 --> 14:49.240]  asking all day how do I do this how do I do that you want to wage war legally and
[14:49.240 --> 14:53.880]  lawfully in info war there's a reason they're trying to ban journalism in
[14:53.880 --> 14:57.280]  this country and cameras and research and the reason they are so scared of
[14:57.280 --> 15:00.880]  leakers and government exposing corruption because really an old-fashioned
[15:00.880 --> 15:08.560]  muck-racking journalist is a spy for the people that's what it is the stuff the
[15:08.560 --> 15:14.240]  CIA and people do that they make so sexy and so the avant-garde and oh my gosh you
[15:14.240 --> 15:18.600]  know it's James Bond that's not really how it is it's mainly Wayne Mads and
[15:18.600 --> 15:24.800]  shuffling around you know in his sports jacket you know infiltrating things and
[15:24.800 --> 15:28.600]  asking questions and talking to whistleblowers going into places with
[15:28.600 --> 15:36.360]  hidden cameras that's what real human intelligence spy craft is against the
[15:36.360 --> 15:38.960]  globalist and that's what they're afraid of because they're committing crimes
[15:38.960 --> 15:46.320]  everywhere and all you've got to do is learn the basics of this and go engage
[15:46.320 --> 15:52.640]  them I don't care if it's the local zoning board I don't care if it's the
[15:52.640 --> 15:56.880]  local corrupt cops I don't care what it is they are scared to death and they
[15:56.880 --> 16:01.400]  should be because if you go and investigate your government here's an
[16:01.400 --> 16:05.680]  example if the cops are changing people's tires in your town and friendly and
[16:05.680 --> 16:09.120]  nice and waving at you and only in really going after criminals when your
[16:09.120 --> 16:14.120]  house gets broken into you can go go to the bar they're at and sit there and
[16:14.120 --> 16:17.720]  listen in on things and nothing's gonna be going on they're gonna be talking
[16:17.720 --> 16:22.320]  about politics and saving America you go you got cops bugging their eyes out at
[16:22.320 --> 16:27.160]  you searching people's cars without warrants acting arrogant not responding
[16:27.160 --> 16:31.080]  to crimes you go to the local cop bar or whatever they're gonna be talking about
[16:31.080 --> 16:37.080]  whores they're running drugs they're dealing people they're killing and look
[16:37.080 --> 16:40.240]  you can get killed doing this let me just tell you okay they tried to set up
[16:40.240 --> 16:43.920]  they've gone after everything else but if you really want to save America I'm
[16:43.920 --> 16:49.040]  telling you folks I have brought down you can look it up all sorts of people in
[16:49.040 --> 16:53.880]  the zoning department the health department the police department the
[16:53.880 --> 16:58.360]  city I mean I investigations I've done have sent people to prison over and over
[16:58.360 --> 17:04.840]  again and it's almost instantaneous I start investigating day one and use
[17:04.840 --> 17:11.800]  basic spy tactics police tactics whatever you want to call it I mean I
[17:11.800 --> 17:15.120]  walk into a board meeting and I go I know you're covering up the you've
[17:15.120 --> 17:19.040]  committed crimes I don't even address anybody individually so there's no
[17:19.040 --> 17:23.640]  libel and then I look at who freaks out and then I corner them with a while I'm
[17:23.640 --> 17:27.360]  recording them that's why mafia run states have laws against this so check
[17:27.360 --> 17:31.880]  your local laws and I say I you know I've got the info on you and then they

[24:12.600 --> 24:18.920]  all right Alex Jones your host here back live we're gonna have former real
[24:18.920 --> 24:23.080]  black panther original black panther party head of communications minister
[24:23.080 --> 24:29.320]  communications Larry pink neon to talk about the new black panther party that
[24:29.320 --> 24:34.680]  says unrest all over America if Zimmerman acquitted and they go on to
[24:34.680 --> 24:38.920]  talk about putting cutting crackers heads off and putting them in book bags
[24:38.920 --> 24:44.000]  quote being attributed to the new black panther party leader Shamir Shabazz by
[24:44.000 --> 24:48.440]  numerous internet site states this time we're going to do it right this time
[24:48.440 --> 24:51.960]  we're not burning down our communities and he said stuff like this before in
[24:51.960 --> 24:57.000]  public this time we're going out to whitey suburbs and burning down his
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.680]  community remember Michael Moore said whites are buying guns because they're
[25:00.680 --> 25:04.520]  racist to protect themselves I thought everybody was buying guns to protect
[25:04.520 --> 25:08.200]  themselves I don't think that will go too well except in like Chicago and
[25:08.200 --> 25:11.440]  New York and a few places where the government's taking the guns everybody's
[25:11.440 --> 25:16.760]  victims I couldn't imagine if anybody tried to come into neighborhoods and say
[25:16.760 --> 25:23.400]  Texas and burn things down it would not go well that's all I cuz I'm sorry my
[25:23.400 --> 25:28.240]  guns haven't been turned in the corrupt government or black panther groups
[25:28.240 --> 25:31.640]  working for the Justice Department aren't gonna just be able to cut my head off so
[25:31.640 --> 25:34.400]  easy though I should come out because all whites are racist and early bad and
[25:34.400 --> 25:39.680]  cut my own head off continuing here this time we're doing it right this time
[25:39.680 --> 25:43.320]  we're not burning down our communities this time we're going out to whitey
[25:43.320 --> 25:47.520]  suburbs and burning down his entire community we're going to make whitey
[25:47.520 --> 25:53.840]  feel the pain this appears to be no primary evidence that Shabazz actually
[25:53.840 --> 25:57.200]  made that statement although he has previously made vile threats about
[25:57.200 --> 26:01.160]  murdering white people yet sounds like what he says according to the group's
[26:01.160 --> 26:06.800]  Twitter feed so this is their official 23 to engage in in no unlawful activity
[26:06.800 --> 26:10.880]  in response to the verdict but the organization also states we can't and
[26:10.880 --> 26:16.680]  won't try to control the general dissatisfied population for sure we
[26:16.680 --> 26:20.760]  are organizing the group is also planning rallies and street maneuvers
[26:20.760 --> 26:25.240]  but refuses to provide details and you've got these guys out front polling
[26:25.240 --> 26:30.680]  places with you know baseball bats and clubs so no one stops black people from
[26:30.680 --> 26:33.920]  voting like in the middle of a mainly black city you're gonna have white guys
[26:33.920 --> 26:38.320]  there stopping people voting I mean it's it's again this is actually meant to
[26:38.320 --> 26:43.200]  invoke race if you listen to what these guys say and the way they behave it's
[26:43.200 --> 26:47.160]  the exact kind of stuff you'd hear from like the clan a hundred years ago but
[26:47.160 --> 26:51.800]  see it's called reverse racism as if racism could only come from white
[26:51.800 --> 26:55.880]  people it's tribalism folks in Africa you'll have one black group killing the
[26:55.880 --> 26:59.560]  other black group or you know you'd have one Scottish clan killing the other
[26:59.560 --> 27:04.800]  Scottish clan of 700 years ago or a thousand years ago or we all know the
[27:04.800 --> 27:10.960]  history of it people look for reasons to get into gangs and to be in gang
[27:10.960 --> 27:16.400]  psychology and it's its loser psychology in my view and it's how the power
[27:16.400 --> 27:23.120]  structure manipulates people for the record whatever God moves black people
[27:23.120 --> 27:27.560]  to do after the verdict I can never be called a riot it's called a rebellion
[27:27.560 --> 27:32.320]  on the Twitter feed from the new black Panther Party another tweet the group
[27:32.320 --> 27:35.880]  comments that there is a high chance of rebellion across the nation if Zimmerman
[27:35.880 --> 27:40.840]  is acquitted on all charges in addition to another message which states if
[27:40.840 --> 27:44.400]  Zimmerman is acquitted there's likely to be unrest all over America it would be
[27:44.400 --> 27:52.040]  way beyond the capacity of the new black Panther Party yeah but it just takes
[27:52.040 --> 27:57.000]  groups calling for it and then when the police come out and say please don't you
[27:57.000 --> 28:02.680]  know how many violence the time magazine comes out yesterday and says it's racist
[28:02.680 --> 28:07.000]  folks when you look at the police department area Florida I was looking
[28:07.000 --> 28:11.080]  at the numbers like half the people on it are here are Hispanic and then a large
[28:11.080 --> 28:16.600]  portion are black the whites are already minority in most areas this country and
[28:16.600 --> 28:19.960]  will be a total minority what is it in five years but it still doesn't matter
[28:19.960 --> 28:26.480]  it's as if the evil only emanates out of white people and it's just crazy to see
[28:26.480 --> 28:31.280]  time magazine again mainly white people it's always white authors trying to stir
[28:31.280 --> 28:34.960]  up racial divide because they sit there and play off of it you turn on MSNBC
[28:34.960 --> 28:40.040]  it's amazing the race baiting that goes on and how the president came out and
[28:40.040 --> 28:42.960]  said he looks like my son and then sent the Justice Department down there
[28:42.960 --> 28:49.400]  secretly but this came out though and spent masses of amounts of money on
[28:49.400 --> 28:57.320]  record funding groups to organize demonstrations and then we've already
[28:57.320 --> 29:01.880]  had stores ransacked and things last year over this this is so amazing ladies
[29:01.880 --> 29:05.560]  and gentlemen and the media is showing images of Trayvon when he's 12 not only
[29:05.560 --> 29:10.320]  17 you know with the grill and and trying to make the gangster face and the
[29:10.320 --> 29:14.680]  fact that his mother sent him to his dad because of all the trouble he was getting
[29:14.680 --> 29:18.440]  into in the burglary tools and the you see there's a culture in America because
[29:18.440 --> 29:22.520]  we've become a prison state of where it's tough to be a thug it's tough to be a
[29:22.520 --> 29:26.640]  gangster across the board black white Hispanic it's everywhere and kids get
[29:26.640 --> 29:32.680]  bullied into joining gangs at school and then you get sent to juvenile for almost
[29:32.680 --> 29:36.840]  no reason and then once you're there you basically are forced to join a gang
[29:36.840 --> 29:44.640]  that's the culture it's so disgusting to see this happening and the police
[29:44.640 --> 29:48.600]  themselves are being turned into a gang we're gonna look at a new app when we
[29:48.600 --> 29:53.800]  come back that helps you title on your neighbor's guns we're on the March the

[33:46.080 --> 33:54.320]  points the big score anyone any sex over 75 years old has been up the
[33:54.320 --> 34:07.360]  100 points as always how fast you move determines how long you live resistance
[34:07.360 --> 34:14.400]  to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[34:18.080 --> 34:21.560]  all right coming up in about seven eight minutes we're gonna have Larry
[34:21.560 --> 34:28.000]  pink me a real black panther a real humanitarian joining us to talk about I
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.560]  talked to him privately while he was here about how the new black Panther
[34:30.560 --> 34:35.000]  Party no doubt is federally handled and some of its members are reportedly
[34:35.000 --> 34:38.840]  calling for basically racially organized attacks and I've seen members of the
[34:38.840 --> 34:43.760]  new black Panther Party on Fox television actually saying don't mug in the
[34:43.760 --> 34:48.840]  black community go blow mug in the white community just absolutely the
[34:48.840 --> 34:52.920]  opposite of what Martin Luther King talked about judging people by the
[34:52.920 --> 34:58.120]  character of their deeds and what they stood for not by what color they are
[34:58.120 --> 35:02.640]  but this is the racial politics the globalist want to engage in and again
[35:02.640 --> 35:06.160]  I'm on record saying that I believe what Zimmerman did was stupid and negligent
[35:06.160 --> 35:10.560]  to go following somebody around with a gun but the way the media has hyped this
[35:10.560 --> 35:15.360]  and they're now trying to not give him a fair trial is another travesty of
[35:15.360 --> 35:19.680]  justice and they're playing this out to create division we're gonna be going
[35:19.680 --> 35:23.120]  over the divide and conquer race politics with Larry pink me coming up
[35:23.120 --> 35:26.280]  here in just a few minutes I haven't gotten into Janet Napolitano to head
[35:26.280 --> 35:30.240]  the California college system where she gets triple the money she gets his head
[35:30.240 --> 35:39.120]  of Homeland Security right now I will not miss the tyrant that heads up
[35:39.120 --> 35:42.040]  Homeland Security but I will assure you things will not get better with her
[35:42.040 --> 35:46.040]  leaving and in a way it's bad that a new face will be there because she's so low
[35:46.040 --> 35:50.960]  that this big sis that it's very effective tool to expose Homeland
[35:50.960 --> 35:55.040]  Security's activities by pointing out the caricature of kind of a hairman
[35:55.040 --> 36:02.240]  gearing in drag that that she has become so we're gonna be talking about Ms.
[36:02.240 --> 36:06.440]  Napolitano of course the real intel I've got is it was all the sexual stuff
[36:06.440 --> 36:10.280]  going on at the Justice Department and at the Homeland Security and the
[36:10.280 --> 36:13.720]  settlements they're doing with the men there the group of women that run
[36:13.720 --> 36:18.640]  things up there if you can call them women and so we're going to be breaking
[36:18.640 --> 36:23.520]  all of that down as well but they are fleeing the sinking ship that is the
[36:23.520 --> 36:29.560]  rat-infested vermin command base that is the district of criminals that that is
[36:29.560 --> 36:33.080]  hoping that its paramilitary force is going to allow it to continue to loot
[36:33.080 --> 36:37.040]  this country and that is hoping that division is going to help them divide
[36:37.040 --> 36:40.400]  us so we don't go after the real globalists that have hijacked this
[36:40.400 --> 36:45.200]  country I'm telling you they're in deep trouble and they have a chance of
[36:45.200 --> 36:48.640]  being defeated if we unify around liberty in the Bill of Rights and
[36:48.640 --> 36:53.560]  Constitution and human justice now I briefly wanted to get Leigh Ann
[36:53.560 --> 36:57.200]  McAdoo one of our great reporters here at Info Wars on the radio and also on
[36:57.200 --> 37:02.080]  the TV on because tonight she's going to have a in-depth piece on the Don
[37:02.080 --> 37:06.440]  Salazar article that she worked on with him dealing with all these new apps
[37:06.440 --> 37:09.880]  coming out the title on your neighbor they leave their lights on the title on
[37:09.880 --> 37:12.680]  your neighbor if they're not you know watering on the wrong day to title on
[37:12.680 --> 37:15.840]  your neighbor if they're not composting properly to tell you the green police
[37:15.840 --> 37:20.600]  well now they have apps the government's out there promoting that that allow you
[37:20.600 --> 37:24.200]  to report guns you've seen the billboards up in the last decade that say
[37:24.200 --> 37:27.960]  report illegal guns they have them in Texas and it shows a revolver or a
[37:27.960 --> 37:32.600]  shotgun those aren't illegal I mean there's only a few cities like DC New
[37:32.600 --> 37:35.880]  York where they're illegal and that's unconstitutional the Supreme Court said
[37:35.880 --> 37:41.280]  five years ago in DC versus Heller so but it creates the illusion that they're
[37:41.280 --> 37:47.000]  illegal and will have false reports made and folks I see it even in Texas you
[37:47.000 --> 37:51.280]  put your dear rifle on your truck even in semi-rural areas and somebody who
[37:51.280 --> 37:55.040]  doesn't understand that it's legal calls the cops they still pull you over and
[37:55.040 --> 37:59.520]  freak out and sometimes take the gun because it's like a holy sacrament in
[37:59.520 --> 38:05.480]  the tattletale world to always respond to their fake complaints their Stasi
[38:05.480 --> 38:09.100]  complaints but then your car gets stolen your house gets broken into and the
[38:09.100 --> 38:14.080]  police are like sorry we can't come out I've had my car stolen in Austin and in
[38:14.080 --> 38:18.680]  Dallas and the police wouldn't come out till I hung the phone up in Dallas one
[38:18.680 --> 38:23.200]  time and the cops show up five minutes later pushed their way into the apartment
[38:23.200 --> 38:26.720]  when I opened the door this is back when I was younger and you didn't know how to
[38:26.720 --> 38:30.560]  respond for it searching things going why'd you hang up 911 well you said you
[38:30.560 --> 38:34.680]  couldn't help me you weren't given permission yet and I was on the phone
[38:34.680 --> 38:37.720]  like 10 minutes so you can't help me they ever find the car this is where I
[38:37.720 --> 38:41.800]  call to see if they tow truck it in and then I'll be charged for the tow trucking
[38:41.800 --> 38:44.760]  and sure enough they found it all chopped you know the engine taking out
[38:44.760 --> 38:48.480]  parts up at the wheels I was like okay whatever what even rude just hung up
[38:48.480 --> 38:53.200]  boom five minutes later cops are there so here to briefly talk about what's
[38:53.200 --> 38:56.400]  coming up tonight on the nightly news seven o'clock Central is Leanne McAdoo
[38:56.400 --> 39:01.520]  Leanne tell us about this story well it's the United Stasi of America they
[39:01.520 --> 39:06.880]  strike again with this app is going to crowdsource your neighbors to build a
[39:06.880 --> 39:12.120]  de facto gun registry so and it's not just you know illegal guns it's they
[39:12.120 --> 39:17.320]  want all the guns anyone who they think is a first-time gun owner who might not
[39:17.320 --> 39:22.640]  be familiar with the basic rules of gun safety so they want to create fake cases
[39:22.640 --> 39:27.280]  yeah sin cops out this is incredible this is a anti-gun Stasi yeah that's
[39:27.280 --> 39:32.320]  well that's their mission is to influence the national policy with this app it
[39:32.320 --> 39:35.840]  says it right there on their website great an anti-gun witch which I saw a
[39:35.840 --> 39:39.480]  witch yeah we start throwing gun owners into the water with lead weights on them
[39:39.480 --> 39:42.800]  and if they drowned it proves they weren't a witch but if they float we
[39:42.800 --> 39:46.800]  burn them right well the Gestapo now they have a new tool it's now it's not
[39:46.800 --> 39:51.640]  just word-of-mouth tattle-tailing now they have this app that you can basically
[39:51.640 --> 39:58.240]  flag any home where it's a first-time gun owner you know if someone has an NRA
[39:58.240 --> 40:02.000]  bumper sticker they might not be that bad but they're probably also you know
[40:02.000 --> 40:05.560]  very anti-government yeah so it actually says if they have that go ahead and
[40:05.560 --> 40:10.040]  report them yeah it says if they have an NRA bumper sticker they they're they
[40:10.040 --> 40:13.840]  may already be kind of letting you know that they have a gun on the property but
[40:13.840 --> 40:18.680]  you might want to go ahead and flag it just as a warning to others so it's just
[40:18.680 --> 40:23.320]  this is terroristic in my view you know they've lost lawsuits over this and
[40:23.320 --> 40:26.720]  newspapers have gotten a lot of trouble when they publish concealed carry
[40:26.720 --> 40:30.800]  holders at home addresses which is like hey here's the place to go Rob if you
[40:30.800 --> 40:34.280]  want guns like people putting that on Facebook so they know where to come Rob
[40:34.280 --> 40:38.720]  and so there's been lawsuits over this and and you're saying on the app page
[40:38.720 --> 40:42.720]  because I read your article with a dime but but on their page they actually say
[40:42.720 --> 40:48.120]  flag in a public app system exactly where the guns are at exactly and it says
[40:48.120 --> 40:52.080]  to get really descriptive on what you think the person's mental health is if
[40:52.080 --> 40:56.120]  you think they are someone who has a mental issue like it I mean it says be
[40:56.120 --> 41:00.800]  descriptive and mark it and flag it and there's no opt-out option you can't
[41:00.800 --> 41:05.440]  challenge an erroneous marking it's just someone can flag your spot but it says
[41:05.440 --> 41:09.840]  if you know that the person's a criminal or if there's you know gangsters
[41:09.840 --> 41:12.880]  stuff going on you shouldn't mark it oh no no cuz that's probably being run by
[41:12.880 --> 41:17.080]  acorn well it's being run by Obama so you don't yeah exactly you can't go
[41:17.080 --> 41:22.240]  mark 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue you know what I mean or all the new IRS people
[41:22.240 --> 41:25.120]  with their their new guy that congressman was trying to get a tour to go
[41:25.120 --> 41:27.880]  went why are they buying billions of bullets and he walks into the training
[41:27.880 --> 41:33.320]  center and it's IRS agents with m16s yeah literally shooting targets of women
[41:33.320 --> 41:38.680]  and children well don't mark the criminals though because they're not
[41:38.680 --> 41:41.520]  gonna pay their taxes so they got to see when I saw this story and went to their
[41:41.520 --> 41:45.040]  site and so I couldn't even believe it it's like it's satire but it's not satire
[41:45.040 --> 41:50.400]  tell people about the group well the group they are the it's the gun geomarker
[41:50.400 --> 41:54.280]  they have a few other apps out but they're they're useless and we'll put
[41:54.280 --> 41:57.880]  the article on screen for folks there that are watching us on TV it's new
[41:57.880 --> 42:03.320]  app allows its users to title on gun owners and it says apps website encourages
[42:03.320 --> 42:07.480]  users to report gun owners who hold anti-government political views I mean
[42:07.480 --> 42:12.720]  this is the citizen stasi yes ahead of them staging whenever they stage and
[42:12.720 --> 42:17.280]  coming after us my goodness this is the gun geomarker app created by a group
[42:17.280 --> 42:21.640]  called the walking tools laboratory and available through the Google Play
[42:21.640 --> 42:26.640]  Android marketplace says marking dangerous sites on the app map will let
[42:26.640 --> 42:29.760]  you and others be aware of the risk in your neighborhood people have asked me
[42:29.760 --> 42:34.320]  to do an app like this Leanne but you know about globalist or new world order
[42:34.320 --> 42:38.320]  people but I won't do it because they'll put innocent people on there and I'm not
[42:38.320 --> 42:42.240]  gonna organize some deal I mean I think legally and lawfully you really can't do
[42:42.240 --> 42:46.760]  this we could create something where we vet it's a globalist and then I put my
[42:46.760 --> 42:50.480]  name on it but still that'd be a huge responsibility they have a name for this
[42:50.480 --> 42:55.960]  this is called ultra dangerous witch hunt yeah a high-tech lynching man this
[42:55.960 --> 42:59.320]  is creepy wow I mean people got to read the rest the article this should be
[42:59.320 --> 43:03.200]  national national news any other comments on this you're gonna be covering it
[43:03.200 --> 43:06.800]  more than nine on the night having a full report on this tonight on the info
[43:06.800 --> 43:12.200]  wars nightly news and yeah I don't think it's gonna do very well it's already got
[43:12.200 --> 43:16.400]  over a thousand two thousand comments from people saying this is ridiculous I
[43:16.400 --> 43:20.560]  hope you get sued if you ever put my information up there you know I'm gonna
[43:20.560 --> 43:25.280]  take you down so they've been on Fox News like defending you know this is we're
[43:25.280 --> 43:29.280]  just trying to save kids and this is but it's not it says it says right there on
[43:29.280 --> 43:33.120]  their website they want to change national policy with this app well that's
[43:33.120 --> 43:35.920]  why they put billboards up I've been all over the country that everybody's seen
[43:35.920 --> 43:40.240]  them I've done reports and shot video which shows a revolver last time I saw
[43:40.240 --> 43:43.480]  one was a couple years ago in Galveston I took a shot of it I think tweeted it but
[43:43.480 --> 43:47.840]  it says report illegal guns yeah and I had a carpet cleaner in my house 15 years
[43:47.840 --> 43:52.800]  ago who saw a shotgun I didn't have kids then you know on the wall in a gun rack
[43:52.800 --> 43:58.160]  and he started freaking out because it was a black pump like $300 at the time
[43:58.160 --> 44:05.160]  Winchester defender and he saw it started going I can't I got a and left and I'm
[44:05.160 --> 44:08.680]  like you're not calling the cops I mean and I call the place is he calling the
[44:08.680 --> 44:12.680]  cops sir we he called us we understand but he isn't comfortable cleaning your
[44:12.680 --> 44:18.480]  house okay I mean it's a witch hunt yeah this is basically like the same thing
[44:18.480 --> 44:22.760]  that they're doing with pedophiles and they're basically equating gun owners
[44:22.760 --> 44:26.920]  with building a database yeah but if you had a database saying I think this guy
[44:26.920 --> 44:30.160]  looked weird at my kid while he was watering his lawn you know maybe the
[44:30.160 --> 44:34.280]  guys having a pain in their head or something it's been so many times back
[44:34.280 --> 44:37.400]  when I live near neighbors that I'd be in the yard watering something talking to
[44:37.400 --> 44:40.520]  myself or like picking my nose or whatever and I look up my neighbors
[44:40.520 --> 44:43.720]  looking at me I mean what I look weird now they're gonna like I think he's a
[44:43.720 --> 44:48.800]  Herbert or something you know he's he's got mustard yeah that's what this whole
[44:48.800 --> 44:53.400]  thing is about based on user feelings about the situation it's that's it's like
[44:53.400 --> 44:57.360]  do you think this person's able to that's how it was in the Soviet Union I
[44:57.360 --> 45:02.320]  think yeah you might be anti-communist well two years in a labor camp
[45:02.320 --> 45:07.280]  by the way the Army manual says they now have re-education centers that that's
[45:07.280 --> 45:10.560]  the thing why I freak out on early and this stuff look at these FBI reports
[45:10.560 --> 45:12.880]  and we're going to our guest Larry Pinkney till a little bit the next hour
[45:12.880 --> 45:16.600]  he's on the line now via video Skype they have hundreds of these every year
[45:16.600 --> 45:20.920]  they put out communities against terrorism and it says using cash to buy
[45:20.920 --> 45:26.040]  coffee political indicators of terrorist activities and rental properties
[45:26.040 --> 45:30.400]  talks to renters ask questions they say in here are nice to police that's why
[45:30.400 --> 45:33.080]  I've walked up because hey how you doing guys don't go why are you talking to me
[45:33.080 --> 45:38.240]  yes yeah we're not supposed to talk to slaves I've noticed that that's just
[45:38.240 --> 45:41.480]  paying for your morning coffee with cash a potential terrorist activity oh this
[45:41.480 --> 45:45.960]  is not Monty Python folks I mean there's hundreds of these we wrote articles
[45:45.960 --> 45:51.200]  about him a few days ago it's the people that make frequent references to the US
[45:51.200 --> 45:57.320]  Constitution yeah yeah they're terrorists if you believe in liberty it's
[45:57.320 --> 46:00.360]  terror but why do they say if there really are like if you actually see
[46:00.360 --> 46:03.720]  them shooting people or you actually see them dealing drugs do not mark them well
[46:03.720 --> 46:07.600]  that's just one of the flaws in the app it only lets you tag a place that you
[46:07.600 --> 46:12.120]  are physically standing at the location so you have to be able to stand there
[46:12.120 --> 46:19.720]  for up to a minute and mark the place well Steve quail was told he was told
[46:19.720 --> 46:24.080]  of the radio host author two years before that they were going to mark our
[46:24.080 --> 46:27.960]  doors so they could raid people's houses that were marking it for gun owners
[46:27.960 --> 46:30.320]  and everybody freaked out on him and you know what it turned out that was
[46:30.320 --> 46:34.320]  true so see and then he says all this other stuff I'm like is the rest of it
[46:34.320 --> 46:38.320]  true yeah it's like it just gets weirder it's like when I heard they have fetal
[46:38.320 --> 46:42.480]  tissue and Pepsi I'm like that's not true yeah that's true yeah I mean I mean
[46:42.480 --> 46:47.560]  it's like what is going on here it's like we are living in bizarro world when's
[46:47.560 --> 46:52.000]  bizarro gonna fly by I mean it's like I know we just need bizarro on the green
[46:52.000 --> 46:57.280]  screen well listen Leanne you're gonna be covering this in depth tonight nightly
[46:57.280 --> 47:00.720]  news seven o'clock sent for anything else you want to absolutely just thanks
[47:00.720 --> 47:04.960]  for having me and I guess everyone go and review the app don't don't don't tag
[47:04.960 --> 47:08.400]  me the fact that we have concealed carry guys that work at the office we can't
[47:08.400 --> 47:11.440]  tag the Department of Homeland Security and the IRS and all that because we're
[47:11.440 --> 47:15.560]  not physically there so we want all of our listeners to go tag the White House
[47:15.560 --> 47:19.360]  and that's actually a good way to counter this just go tag there are
[47:19.360 --> 47:23.200]  criminals there well it's like a curtain you walk in you go I've got underage sex
[47:23.200 --> 47:26.520]  slaves I don't run the op well we got people to work with it they go to
[47:26.520 --> 47:29.480]  office after office because that's I mean this is a criminal organization yeah
[47:29.480 --> 47:32.960]  exactly go flag the dangerous gun owners we know where they're at well if you
[47:32.960 --> 47:36.520]  got an IRA sticker by all means oh for sure well I've seen that on Discovery

[54:07.120 --> 54:11.240]  all right I wanted to get Larry pink me on the day and I really appreciate him
[54:11.240 --> 54:16.520]  joining us because he is a veteran of the Black Panther Party the former
[54:16.520 --> 54:20.320]  minister of interior the Republic of New Africa a former political prisoner and
[54:20.320 --> 54:24.000]  the only American who successfully self-opered his civil political rights
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.440]  case the United Nations under the International Covenant of Civil and
[54:26.440 --> 54:30.240]  Political Rights and it's also come out even in Congress that he was set up under
[54:30.240 --> 54:35.120]  Coantel pro and he has been very critical of the New Black Panther Party
[54:35.120 --> 54:40.520]  which is just like the Cook loss clan in my view federally handled run meant to
[54:40.520 --> 54:44.800]  act completely idiotic and make everybody hate each other Larry give us the
[54:44.800 --> 54:49.440]  inside scoop on what you think of the attempts by a lot of different sides to
[54:49.440 --> 54:56.520]  try to create a racial explosion out of the tragic Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman
[54:56.520 --> 55:01.920]  case what's your take on that my take on first of all my brother Alex is good
[55:01.920 --> 55:06.680]  to hear your voice thank you thank you for your ears all right and thank all
[55:06.680 --> 55:11.280]  your your viewers and listeners now to answer your question this is Coantel
[55:11.280 --> 55:16.920]  pro all over again this is a counterintelligence program on steroids
[55:16.920 --> 55:23.880]  you dig it's on steroids and and the fact is is that we need to understand it
[55:23.880 --> 55:30.800]  for what it really is this is about divide conquer keep in fear and control
[55:30.800 --> 55:35.880]  that's what this is about Alex my brother we need to keep on putting that
[55:35.880 --> 55:41.400]  information out there you need to keep on putting that information as do I out
[55:41.400 --> 55:50.080]  there that's my perspective on that I agree and it's so transparent you know
[55:50.080 --> 55:54.720]  they've they've declassified FBI fake comic books they would put out about the
[55:54.720 --> 55:58.880]  Black Panther showing Black Panthers killing white people to be blamed on
[55:58.880 --> 56:03.720]  you I mean this is just it's pretty obvious this new what's your inside
[56:03.720 --> 56:07.880]  take on the new Black Panther Party because you've told me off air they're
[56:07.880 --> 56:15.200]  pretty bad Nash well look I want everybody everybody black white brown
[56:15.200 --> 56:20.200]  red and yellow folk all my brothers and sisters all my sisters and brothers I
[56:20.200 --> 56:25.040]  want you to stop and I want you to think just for I know it's hard to think
[56:25.040 --> 56:32.040]  but stop and think just for a few seconds who are these people who is
[56:32.040 --> 56:38.480]  funding these people where do they come from whose interests are they serving
[56:38.480 --> 56:46.080]  okay good questions more often than not turn out to be in themselves good
[56:46.080 --> 56:52.880]  answers all right why is it that the so-called new Black Panther Party is
[56:52.880 --> 57:01.520]  always on hand to fan the flames of hatred to fan the flames of fear the
[57:01.520 --> 57:08.960]  fan the flames of this unity no we need unity among black white brown red and
[57:08.960 --> 57:14.840]  yellow everyday ordinary people so I'm throwing some questions out there the
[57:14.840 --> 57:20.320]  original Black Panther Party formed in October of 1966 of which I was a member
[57:20.320 --> 57:25.240]  believed in all power to the people black white brown red and yellow people
[57:25.240 --> 57:32.400]  alright all of us because we understood and we understand today that this
[57:32.400 --> 57:41.080]  struggle is about all of us you know resistance is not futile it is essential
[57:41.080 --> 57:47.720]  to our life and our liberty absolutely I mean so transparent with the new Black
[57:47.720 --> 57:52.600]  Panther Party the stuff that comes out it's it's meant to to to make it all
[57:52.600 --> 57:57.120]  about race instead of about the issues and if anybody was for real and talk
[57:57.120 --> 58:02.480]  like that they'd be arrested right right I mean ask yourself this question or we
[58:02.480 --> 58:09.360]  should ask ourselves this question now the Black Panther Party was formed in
[58:09.360 --> 58:15.200]  October of 1966 I ain't talking I'm not talking about the so-called new Black
[58:15.200 --> 58:22.520]  Panther okay jive jive jive as we say back in the day but it's worse than jive
[58:22.520 --> 58:29.920]  because when you talk about going into communities and killing people in those
[58:29.920 --> 58:36.520]  communities what you're talking about is spanning hatred you're talking about
[58:36.520 --> 58:40.160]  absolutely stay there we're back in 60 seconds I want to talk about what would
[58:40.160 --> 58:48.760]  happen if this actually took place this is GCN the Genesis communications

[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:14.880]  brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:22.400]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:35.240]  Alex Jones coming up we're going to have Wayne Madsen a real NSA whistleblower in
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:39.640]  studio weather she's been demonized by CNN this week where the fact that he
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:45.840]  continues to reveal bombshell info right now Larry Pinckney joins us and
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:49.200]  perhaps we should get Larry on the news tonight so he can go for like 30 minutes
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:53.920]  uninterrupted by ads and really break down what's happening here but it's so
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:57.440]  transparent that when they turn turns out the feds are funding the white
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:01.400]  supremacist and having a march to create division or then they're funding
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:04.960]  radical racist black groups to create the division so then everybody's scared of
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:08.720]  each other and government can then play the part of the referee that's what I
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:12.400]  take away from the reports at the new Black Panther Party people that we have
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:18.400]  upon info wars.com we're talking about reportedly you know going in and burning
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:22.640]  down the white neighborhoods or whatever that means what you were getting to
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:26.840]  what's really behind this a former real member of the original Black Panther
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:32.080]  Party their head of information Larry Pinckney Larry look the bottom line is
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:38.840]  this if we want unity then we're going to have to work out our problems work
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:43.560]  out whatever our disagreements might be we're gonna have to work them out
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:52.480]  together you cannot and I repeat no one we cannot fight quote racism or
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:59.320]  exploitation economic exploitation with more racism and economic
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:06.520]  exploitation it does not take a rocket scientist to figure that out and we
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:13.480]  ordinary everyday black white brown red and yellow people are very astute but I
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:18.440]  mean how does pulling regional dining out and bashing his face in or or burning
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:23.440]  down a predominantly white neighborhood we're just random people in it I mean
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:27.400]  it's the same way like the Klan going out just randomly lynching black people
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:33.280]  I mean it it's just mindless it's worse than the Klan let me tell you why I say
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:40.680]  to you that it is worse than the Klan black people and white people of good
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:48.360]  will and brown and red and yellow people have fought for many decades in this
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:55.520]  country for equality of all people then you have a group of people quote unquote
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:02.880]  who come along and say nah you know white folk you know they devils white
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:08.680]  folks we're gonna kill them no that's unacceptable as brother Malcolm said and
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:13.960]  that's why I love brother Malcolm because he evolved he grew he understood and
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:19.720]  Malcolm said right is right and wrong is wrong no matter who says it or who does
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:24.240]  it and he's absolutely correct that's why they killed him of course but the
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:29.240]  bottom line is that we need to learn from that these people made sacrifices
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:36.000]  dr. King made sacrifices Rosa Parks John Brown Frederick Douglass I can go on and
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:44.560]  on and on the point is let's not be sucked in by this insidious insipid
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:50.400]  blood-sucking corporate stream media all they want to do is get you to watch
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:59.280]  their vomit okay on television read their vomit in newspapers and magazines the
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:04.320]  last thing they want you to do they don't ever want you to critically think
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:09.360]  for us to critically think and Lord knows they do not want us to come
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:14.360]  together to communicate directly absolutely no they want to get us all
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:17.040]  fighting with each other and then they're the referee I want to come back we
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:20.040]  got Wayne Madsen coming in but do five more minutes with you because I'm gonna
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:23.000]  pull up the name of it we did a video on the nightly news it's now on YouTube
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.360]  that's like an hour long where you eloquently break down what's happening

[01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:20.480]  want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:35.600]  live from Austin Texas Alex Jones Larry Pinkney who is an original black
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:40.320]  panther and one of their main leaders back in the 60s to the 70s was on with
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:43.040]  us a little bit in the last hour he's finishing up now he's had a few other
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:47.800]  questions for him but he said undoubtedly the new black panther party who's
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:50.600]  reportedly been calling for unrest and things and violence in white
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:55.920]  neighborhoods or predominantly white areas is basically there just to create
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:01.160]  divide and conquer so the government can play the part of the savior and you
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:04.600]  can see the media the White House going in there with the Justice Department
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:09.480]  trying to get protests going because they just wanted to be about race instead
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:14.240]  of the economic corruption the foreign banks sucking us dry the big mega
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:19.480]  billionaires tax exempt lobbying for higher taxes on the poor people the so
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:23.640]  called Obamacare written by the insurance companies to rip people off and
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:28.640]  have a private tax they don't want that discussed they don't want real
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:32.200]  unemployment discussed they want us fighting with each other but we've
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:35.800]  talked before and we'll punch it up on screen there's a video that we air on
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:38.640]  the nightly news about a month ago when you were here a mr. painting being
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:41.800]  interviewed for the Obama deception to we want to just put the whole raw
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:45.520]  interview up clips of it'll be in the film and it was titled black panther
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:51.880]  condemns Obama Larry pink me now when you search that it has like 60 something
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:56.880]  thousand hits on the Alex Jones channel views but you cannot search it in YouTube
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:02.680]  and find it on our channel and this started about three weeks ago where none
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:07.080]  of our headlines are searchable only on other people sites that have a copy of
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:11.480]  the headline and so that's why the thousands of other YouTube sites might
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:17.120]  get a million views on a video I do and it gets 30,000 on our site they are
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:23.320]  trying to block us they know we're reaching what let's not exaggerate 15
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:29.200]  plus million a week on AM FM shortwave XM YouTube and a lot of other platforms
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:32.480]  people handing DVDs to each other the point is they're scared of this info
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:38.000]  and they have heavily censored our interviews with mr. Pinkney where they
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.120]  just don't show up they're like ghosts in the machine and they're trying to shut
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:44.000]  down our channel with 300 something million views that's just one channel
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.960]  we've got we've got a whole bunch of others go to the channel where there's
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:50.960]  thousands of incredible reports and videos copy those to your channel give
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:56.000]  them other names jam the system you got to go to conspiracy scope to find the
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.080]  black panther condemns Obama and you know gets into how he's not a lesser of
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:05.800]  two evils he's a more effective of evils for the front of the globalist so
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:09.240]  finishing up with the Democratic Party because I just see them you know they
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:13.020]  fail with their race politics with white racism so now they've just moved into
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:17.000]  divide and conquer your take on that and then if you could just briefly tell
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.480]  your Malcolm X story and how he changed your life you got a chance to get to
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:23.880]  talk to him and know him just like Charlton Heston took time out to talk
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:29.400]  to me and encourage me he was a civil rights activist but for civil rights
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:34.080]  here in the US but then for guns as well just like Malcolm X took time out to
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:37.760]  encourage you early on so let's briefly tell that story then we're gonna go to
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:42.200]  NSA whistleblower Wayne Madsen okay let me say first of all let me send my
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:47.600]  kudos love strength and respect to brother Wayne Madsen I he's a great
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:53.280]  researcher fantastic writer and I read everything that the month that the man
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:58.080]  writes thank you so much look moving on to what you said Alex the bottom line is
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:05.280]  this that I learned we all learn but I certainly learned from brother Malcolm
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:14.560]  when I met him in 1961 and I understood even at that young age that I was then
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:21.760]  that this is a struggle about all people now with respect to the federal
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:27.600]  government and what they are doing you know Obama was groomed and raised by
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:33.760]  the CIA let's be honest stop playing with ourselves stop this intellectual
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:39.800]  masturbation he was groomed and raised by the central intelligence agency he is
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:46.240]  simply carrying on that which is predecessors had already begun now I
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:53.520]  think Alex that we have to understand that we have a responsibility as every
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:59.960]  day ordinary black white brown red and yellow people to communicate with each
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:04.600]  other not only to communicate but to come together whatever our
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:09.480]  disagreements may be and we will have them as Malcolm said we have them in the
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:15.080]  closet but we come out as a united front and that's what we do we have an
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:22.360]  obligation to come together to to fight this national and global power elite
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:30.240]  what we're seeing with the so-called new black Panther Party again I ask you whose
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:36.200]  interests are these people serving going to the white community and burn down
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:45.440]  their homes excuse me kill white babies excuse me but it ain't about that yes
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:50.720]  I'm slipping off into a little ghetto ease it ain't about that it's about the
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:55.480]  power of the people all power to the people black white brown exactly and the
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:58.160]  globalists are scared to death of that and of course you're probably talking
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:01.520]  about some of the earlier new black Panther Party people who would say go
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:05.600]  to the go to the neighborhoods get their babies murder their babies kill the
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:09.800]  women of the military manufacturing center when I'm I'm white and I can tell
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:13.800]  you right now growing up in Dallas my family there wasn't any racist stuff it
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:20.520]  was the opposite but there is there is a then a still a fear and a concern when
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:27.600]  the media plays it up constantly where then instead of of being racist you
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:31.800]  feel so guilty and bad you don't want to be around black people because it makes
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:35.480]  you uncomfortable because you feel like you're so bad see it and again they know
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:40.080]  what they're doing they want us all they want black folks to feel the same not
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:44.120]  that whites are all racist and hate them but that they're uncomfortable as well
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:48.600]  can you speak to that briefly yes the bottom line is what I call in in the
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:53.160]  presentation that you were referring to that that you all covered and thank you
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:58.840]  very much you care that you're carrying I called it an introverted form of
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:04.840]  racism and that's what this is it's where they take racism they twist it and
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:11.480]  distort it you know why is it I'm sick and tired of every time I use the word
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:18.800]  slave black people go what are you talking about me don't they know don't we know
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:25.520]  that slaves were of all colors all colors and you know what today we are
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:32.200]  slaves of all colors just because we have a colored charlatan a colored
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:38.600]  charlatan by the name of Barack Obama who is nothing more than a Trojan horse
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:43.920]  for the national and global power elite just because we have this person
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:49.000]  sitting in the quote White House has not changed anything in fact to the
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:56.600]  contrary things have been made even more insidious and worse so all I have to say
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:03.680]  and I'm gonna say it and tell the day I die that we the people we the people must
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:08.560]  come together for our constitutional right with respect to the bill of rights
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:13.920]  with respect to international law and first and foremost with respect to the
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:22.000]  human rights of all people absolutely all right well listen I appreciate you
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.480]  spending time with us and we'll talk to you very soon Larry probably next week
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:30.960]  this verdict could come out any day in the aftermath of that maybe this Sunday
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:35.280]  we'll we'll stay in close contact thank you so much for spending time with us
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:39.640]  and we'll talk to you soon thank you please John love you Alex watch your
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:43.200]  back and keep on keeping absolutely well we love you as well we love everybody
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:45.920]  that stands up for human dignity and liberty because I'm here to tell you
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:49.680]  folks we're not going to have freedom for anybody under this divide and conquer
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:53.720]  we either unify under liberty and freedom and the individual and what
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:58.200]  people stand for what they produce and who they are instead of what group
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:02.120]  they're in or we're never gonna have a future for our children and humans have
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:06.080]  always been tribal and as he said there have been slaves in every culture in the
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:10.200]  world they never teach that at the schools because they want black folks to
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:15.640]  think it's only them to have this identity this this this inferiority
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:20.560]  complex to then be racially obsessed with it so the government then can
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:24.400]  basically provide them with the propaganda and direct their lives and
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:27.840]  since the government took over the black community you've seen what they've
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:31.440]  done and every other community the government's taking over just that black
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:35.120]  community has been in the clutches of this new world order longer now we're
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:38.840]  gonna go to break and come back with Wayne Madsen I've got like a thousand
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:43.200]  points that I want to go over with him an amazing interview on the nightly news
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:46.440]  last night I sat in the control room while they were you know on the news
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:50.200]  doing the interview him and Rob do it was just so many amazing things and then
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.960]  Wayne's been down to awesome before I've been interviewing Wayne I don't know for
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:57.760]  like 15 years or so off and on on the radio at least about 13 14 I guess it's
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:06.960]  about 1999 so I guess yeah wow 14 years time flies and it's just everything he
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:09.920]  talks about later comes out and turns out to be true I mean this guy's got one
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:13.880]  of the best track records I've ever seen in fact I forgot to get you guys to get
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:17.520]  this I want to play this later in the hour a clip of it it's called reliable
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:23.080]  sources on live unreliable sources it's the show reliable sources but they
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:26.760]  called it unreliable source so just type in reliable sources unreliable source
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:30.120]  takes you to see an end they have the video dues already grabbed it actually
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:33.080]  over on that side so ask him he'll give it to you so you don't have to grab it I
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:37.400]  want to play it where they just spent off and on but I'll play a short clip like
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:41.960]  20 minutes demonizing Wayne Madsen this weekend not just on that show but even
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:46.880]  others saying this guy's a cook he's nuts he says they're tapping the trans
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:50.880]  Atlantic cable that already come out that was true they say that we work with
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:54.600]  the Europeans to spy on everybody that's already admitted I mean he's like Wayne
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:59.840]  Madsen says that water is wet and then it turns out who these guys are from the
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:02.880]  Daily Beast this is a White House operation we're gonna get into that
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:07.440]  first then we're going to get into the latest on the NSA where all this is
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:13.200]  going and then Wayne as a journalist was telling me about and I remember reading
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:16.960]  this a while back about just a few years ago doing stuff with British
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:20.000]  intelligence and all this other stuff I mean this is a really interesting guy
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.320]  and if you want to know what a citizen journalist spy looks like it looks like
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:27.280]  Wayne Madsen they don't most of them don't look like the guy and James Bond
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:31.080]  you know running around kicking people and cars with gadgets all over and the
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:35.480]  rest of it and I guess he's kind of a spy working for the people but he's
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:38.840]  really interesting last night because I can't follow everything he does so
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:41.880]  prolific he was telling me all this other stuff and I was like wow this is
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:46.400]  really wild he can tell you stories about run-ins with the head of the NSA
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:51.480]  and others at the CIA building and all sorts of stuff Wayne Madsen this is a
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:55.640]  guy you could be great to go on a fishing trip with this guy to a cabin for a

[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:53.960]  do we start let me let's start with you're on here a month ago you're on her
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:57.560]  two weeks ago everything you said you guys did this last night weeks after we
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:01.440]  show the clip where you say it or where you said it and then it comes out admitted
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:05.160]  but then they're simultaneously saying you're not a good source you're bad
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:08.880]  because they're upset about you aren't they also hijacked your computer right
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:12.240]  when you got here and wiped it I mean I mean describe what's going on with
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:15.400]  CNN and others and why they're so upset about you because folks may not remember
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:20.120]  I remember ten years ago you were the main NSA master whistleblower who was
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:22.720]  bringing out all these other whistleblowers the difference was bush
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:28.720]  was it prosecuting him right well 15 years ago I was with a group called the
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:33.120]  electronic privacy information center a public you're on the board I was a
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:38.880]  senior fellow with them and we took on as one of the projects the ex expose of
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:43.280]  echelon which was this system by your electronic frontier foundation to you
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:46.600]  were a whole we were allies with them you're a whole bunch of stuff I mean we
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:50.800]  worked with them quite closely we also work with the European Parliament to
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:56.800]  expose this NSA eavesdropping they issued a report I testified before their
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:00.400]  representatives who came to watch it's on record that Hayden had a whole group
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:06.760]  spying on you they had a group called it was a project called first fruits it was
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:11.760]  spying specifically against journalists who wrote about NSA I was told by
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:16.960]  somebody who worked on first fruits I was on the list James Banford was on the
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:21.120]  list Vernon Lowe from the post Bill Gertz from the Washington Times Cy
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:26.120]  Hertz from New Yorker and then it was expanded and then when you see Hayden
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:29.960]  what does he do he even knows what you look like yeah I was told by good
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:34.320]  sources at NSA at the time when Hayden was a director that he got a once a week
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:38.960]  briefing on what I was doing obviously you know what did you hear on his phone
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:44.600]  calls his email and then his deputy Bill Black was briefed daily at you know
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:49.880]  Monday through the thing is you never to your horn you're like the iconic master
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:55.240]  whistleblower guy I mean I mean that's why they're saying this guy's nobody he
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:59.680]  they even said your name wrong over and over again trying to confuse people well
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:03.920]  right I mean on CNN I was referred to as Michael Madsen obviously confused me
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:08.320]  with the actor at least they didn't confuse me with Virginia Madsen who's
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:14.580]  Michael Madsen's sister but you know these people can't get it right they
[01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:18.360]  were saying it anyone who googled me would find out you know I had written
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:21.480]  controversial things in the past of course I do that's how I make my living
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:24.880]  I I'm trying to bring back muckraking journalism as it was practiced by Jack
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:30.480]  Anderson Drew Pearson I have stone HL Menken we can go back into history that's
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:34.640]  been lost we don't have journalism like that anymore we have the reality is
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:40.760]  sensational absolutely so you know I mean so these that these people who were
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:45.320]  attacking we're using Google and they were using Wikipedia Wikipedia my
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:49.760]  entry in Wikipedia my birth date is incorrect so you know my point is I
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:53.360]  know they spell my name wrong on there and my mother's like why is your name
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:56.640]  wrong everywhere emirate can I go they won't change it right I've even sent them
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:01.240]  my driver's license a copy to Wikipedia and they go we're not changing it the
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:05.520]  minute it's full of crap right the minute you change Wikipedia back to you
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:09.120]  know something that looks halfway legitimate somebody goes in and changes
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:14.080]  it back and puts all it's not many journalists and I myself we've all been
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:18.200]  burned by using Wikipedia we just don't you well you can't take what it says if
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:22.200]  the references on the bottom are good a lot of it is really good yeah you go
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:26.120]  it's just that sometimes it's got pure bull like Alex Jones dot of heart attack
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:29.320]  right so I'm getting calls see it out of our deck I know I promise I didn't
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:32.520]  you go to the references see if they're legit that's how you have to use
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:36.760]  Wikipedia but these people did not do their job they used incorrect
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:41.840]  information they use Twitter they look they use all the social networking that
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:46.440]  the Soros people use to overthrow foreign governments and and so it's easy
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:51.280]  to attack a single journalist in this country using the same means that they
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:56.120]  use to overthrow governments in Ukraine and Georgia and Tunisia and I get these
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:59.880]  wave attacks all the time and then I'll search who it is and it's guys active

[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:41.000]  California College school system part of the agreement for her to get the job is
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.800]  she has to wear a muzzle when she enters the ladies room I'm sorry I'm sorry
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:49.600]  Madsen you actually made that joke during the break and I had to steal it
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:55.280]  it's too funny but listen it's not I'm not even against people that are into
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:59.080]  her persuasion I could that's not even my ball game it's that there is the big
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:02.560]  controversy up there and that's my intel a bunch of their deputies have had to
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:06.560]  resign just department they've had people you know do the out-of-court
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:11.480]  settlements what does this they do to the men because they almost do it's the
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:15.400]  men actually that they make I guess like Abu Ghraib crawl around with the dog
[01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:19.520]  leash and stuff so I mean I guess they do need to be politically muzzled in
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:23.240]  there because so so it's like this certain breed of woman that's like
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:26.760]  hyper-dominant I hear they take testosterone and stuff I mean what is
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:31.400]  that you know I don't know we knew this with the Abu Ghraib and some of the
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:35.400]  abuses in Guantanamo and some of the CIA black sites of Saddam
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:40.480]  Saddam masochistic behavior by these interrogators and guards I mean we're
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:45.720]  who who came up with all this I mean these these guards and I think about
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:50.120]  this on CIA did yeah yeah they admit they're mainlining something they just
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:53.640]  like to do yeah and then I was told by a very good source of some of the videos
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:58.920]  of this sexual abuse was being live streamed up to the White House where
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:02.360]  you know Dick Cheney and his buddies were watching it well that actually came
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:06.640]  out in the news that that Congress would would would get the thousands of
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:10.160]  videos and really enjoyed it yeah and then the closet that was streaming all
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:14.120]  this the electrical closet the comm closet and in the old executive office
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:17.840]  building caught on fire it was like a two alarm or three alarm fire the DC
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:22.640]  fire department you know came in there to put the fire out so you know the video
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:26.680]  streaming equipment burned up just when there was interest being expressed in
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:32.840]  what you know Cheney Cheney's role was in in all this abuse that Abu Ghraib and
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:38.400]  other sites but it's like Joseph Mingla all these guys always get into like
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:42.720]  cornered people they control and that's what tyranny is about is they then these
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:47.240]  psychos get to do whatever they want right right so you know the you know the
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:51.760]  people in charge have some real issues well it goes back to Jack or whoever
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:56.720]  like Larry Pinckney was saying you know we one thing we forget is his co-intel
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:03.560]  pro and how they they infiltrated the the black panthers with the people I when
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:07.480]  I was investigating the Obama the book on Obama and the CIA I had members of
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:11.800]  the original Black Panther Party from Chicago tell me that when Obama showed
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:17.200]  up they knew he was you know he's not one of us this guy's a plant they knew
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:21.640]  all about co-intel pro and although that you know at that point in time in the
[01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:26.920]  80s the Black Panther Party the original one was kind of subsiding from the news
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:31.120]  they knew what they had on their hands they had a plant they knew it he was
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:36.480]  even his mother Obama's mother Stanley Ann Dunham said she was shocked to see the
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:43.080]  change in behavior of her son becoming like more of a street guy rather than you
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:47.520]  know the son she raised that's because he was playing and he was play acting and
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:54.240]  it was so good he even fooled his mother apparently amazing there's so much to
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:37:01.240]  talk about but specifically let's let's let's get into what's happening with
[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:05.960]  Snowden your overall take on him is he for real where's all this going what
[01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:09.360]  else is going to come out because Snowden is putting stuff out that you put
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:14.480]  out 15 years ago that Bamford put out on Nightline 12 years ago body of
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:18.520]  secrets we had him on and it was all confirmed to be accurate so they they
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:22.600]  freak out over stuff it's like today they discovered the Grand Canyon it's
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:27.520]  incredible I mean it so what's really going on here well Snowden what he has
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:31.880]  done is he's probably he's we've known all this but you know this this
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:35.640]  information comes in waves we had the echelon interest you know I was on 60
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:41.280]  minutes being interviewed that was back in 2000 we had the in 2099 and we had
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:45.860]  the EU report it was in the news and what Snowden has done is by releasing this
[01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:50.080]  information he's shown where we've come that these programs still exists they've
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:54.640]  that exists they've gotten bigger that the target audience that who they're
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:58.320]  targeting the secret interpretation of the Patriot Act is everything right all
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:03.720]  info but but didn't the head of the total information awareness network wrote
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:06.840]  a New York Times article saying everything you do we're keeping it
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:10.560]  right Admiral Poindexter why didn't he get arrested go ahead Admiral Poindexter
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:18.320]  got hired by DARPA the the Pentagon's research arm to come up with total
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:22.800]  information awareness this was total information awareness so when I when the
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:26.720]  Congress pulled the funding I was told by people look it's just gonna go over
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:30.720]  to NSA you know it's not good it's being pulled out of the Pentagon because
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:33.720]  you know it's well they gave it to private contractors yeah booze Al and
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:37.840]  SEIC they're all have a piece of the action so I think Snowden's for real and
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:41.720]  what he's done is he what he's provided us as the new covered terms for these
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:47.760]  projects tempora for the cable tap prism which was developed by Palantir you
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:52.240]  know at the Pentagon metro station it's the only metro station DC you can't take
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:55.800]  a photograph Palantir took over the whole station with their ad campaign on
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:39:00.040]  the floor on the walls on these signs and one of the things I remembered it I
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:03.400]  wanted to take a picture but they arrest you if you do it there at Pentagon
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:09.720]  Metro was a was a prism showing all this feed coming in and a single feed
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:12.460]  going out on the other side of the prison what do you think that is that's
[01:39:12.460 --> 01:39:18.440]  prism now they denied it they course NSA is going to use off-the-shelf software
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:22.960]  they've done it for years so prism is is Palantir Palantir is also one of the
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:27.520]  sock puppet companies it was you know that attacked Plain Greenwald when he
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:30.320]  was going after the Bank of America for those that don't know what a sock puppet
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:34.440]  is explain it a sock puppet is somebody paid to be on the internet usually
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:38.240]  they're they're operating out of the US cyber command which is a sister command
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:43.840]  of NSA up at Fort Meade each military service has these socks they get on and
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:49.680]  they just make comments on these blogs and that's admitted but but expanding
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:55.920]  they now have programs where one guy can have millions of comments going where
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:58.360]  they go and have a computer program that's why they're now saying they're
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:01.760]  gonna have robots write the news they put out one press release the government
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:06.480]  does and then even with fake names the computer rewrites it different ways to
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:10.400]  make it look like there's variety yeah one person will have like maybe 80 to
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:13.880]  100 identities and it looks like you know the hit in the same website looks
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:17.360]  like 80 people this would happen with when the observer ran my story on the
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:20.160]  front page it looked like they were being inundated by people around the
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:23.920]  world saying how could you put this guy on blah blah blah blah blah I boiled it
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:29.360]  down it was about six to eight people doing this and they constantly put the
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:33.960]  information out there these these comments and it looked like the they
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:38.920]  were big in numbers they're very small but this is how they operate well Israel
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:43.760]  admits for 15 years they've got private citizen brigades and they call it
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:47.120]  megaphone and they've got a computer icon that pops up on the smartphone of
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:50.600]  the computer and then tells people where to go and what to say the Hasbara
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:58.400]  brigade right it's megaphone and and gi y us give is really your united support
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:04.040]  and they've done that for years yeah it makes them look like you know we're
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:08.560]  outraged that some article that criticizes Israel when in fact these are
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:12.800]  dedicated people that populate these comments and see the difference is what
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:14.680]  they haven't gotten around with YouTube even though it's part of their own
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:21.920]  system you'll have 97% positive votes but mainly negative comments because they
[01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:25.600]  don't because the IP addresses even if they jump YouTube's recognizing and not
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:30.480]  letting them vote right and okay then you get the real people to put things
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:34.600]  from the Bible in there that's all part of this operation the YouTube comment
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:37.840]  section it's all this it's just where they'll change the subject
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:41.520]  aversionary right this is what they do they don't want real debate happening
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:44.720]  absolutely they want to just have thinking people tune out of it and by the way
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:48.440]  Casunstein admitted this five years ago cognitive dissonance is what he called
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:55.560]  it listen let me ask your opinion of Adam Kokesh you know you live around DC
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:42:01.680]  you've been around him I I think he has courage on the surface DC Heller has
[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:06.320]  been overthrown and so I tend to not want to nitpick people who I think have a
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:12.240]  lot of courage but I respect your view and opinion of things Adam Kokesh why
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:17.240]  yeah the one thing that intrigues me is why every time he has a run-in with the
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:20.720]  law why is it it's always the US Park police even though it's an area where
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:25.240]  the US Park police has no jurisdiction it's almost like he you know it's he's
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:29.800]  assigned he's got the US Park police assigned to him and I find that very
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:33.920]  unusual well he goes always to park police property he always goes to their
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:37.120]  square there he does it on their jurisdiction right even but you know I
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:40.600]  guess they're ready to ask him about that running in Herndon Virginia and I
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:44.480]  don't think the park has anything they've got Manassas out there but it's
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:49.640]  nowhere near Herndon Virginia and and I remember a guy who was with the Vietnam
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:53.840]  veterans against the war who you know publicly threw his medals over the
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:58.720]  White House fence and was always seen with that these anti-war John Kerry John
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:03.900]  Kerry right wasn't he just the guy to be there you know and later I mean
[01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:08.720]  it's pretty apparent that John Kerry was was infiltrating the anti-war movement
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:13.200]  and look where he is today I have a blind spot because I get accused of being
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:17.720]  an infiltrator so much and I know full well I'm not maniac yes infiltrator I
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:21.080]  guess I'm a people's infiltrator I mean I don't like being a slave I guess I have
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:24.280]  that you know that opposition thing to with the two corrupt authority I'm
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:28.160]  kind of evil so then I start hearing oh yeah this is an operative that's an
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:33.000]  operative and I just get to the point where I don't listen to it but then
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.480]  sometimes it is an operative I don't think his guys are I mean those are real
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:41.400]  guys yeah you know and it was a case with Kerry with the Vietnam vets you
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:45.960]  know the people who were associated with him were you know legitimate anti-war
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:50.280]  protesters who served in Vietnam but John Kerry was just always did you know
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:54.200]  every time he showed up before Congress he had his fatigues on they were they
[01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:58.000]  were dry clean they were pressed you know and his hair was quaffed very nicely
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:01.160]  and the guy the guy was a shill all right I'm gonna I'm gonna throw in it you
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:05.180]  know what your honest response because I know you're for real and I'm just you
[01:44:05.180 --> 01:44:08.480]  keep giving us intel it turns out accurate hundreds of times in the last
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:13.200]  15 years and everything you've said about Snowden's come true so I respect
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:17.520]  your view what do you think of info wars comm and Alex Jones my operation I
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:23.200]  think this operation is so necessary because you know that the corporate
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:27.680]  media look at the over attention now in this Trayvon Martin case that that's
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:32.480]  the Jerry's springerization of the news and nobody you know I mean there's
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:37.240]  things going on all around the world in Syria right now we had this we had a
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:40.880]  commander of the Free Syrian Army being killed by al-Qaeda guys who are being
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:45.840]  armed by Mr. Obama right as we speak he's given them weapons we have this
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:51.800]  mess in Egypt but all we get is this you know this fodder for the Greta
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:58.520]  Vance Sustrans and this you know Grace woman on on CNN headline news remember
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:03.400]  that was headline news now it's all tabloid garbage sure but your bottom
[01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:10.160]  line analysis and here I'm showing viewers a image of the FSA people with
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:13.880]  a four-year-old girl tied up while they murder her family you know cutting
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:18.280]  Christians heads off our own government funding al-Qaeda the Congress saying it's
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:20.600]  time to give him heavy weapons they've been giving him heavy weapons I want to
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:23.560]  you've been to Syria I want to get your take on that but what is your take your
[01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:30.920]  analysis because I really want your psychoanalyzing on Alex Jones you know
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:35.080]  I talked about muckraking journalism for Jack Anderson and Drew Pearson that's
[01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:38.880]  what you're doing here this is the information that people need to know
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:42.920]  it you know you get you get through all the nonsense out there all the stupid
[01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:49.680]  non-stories and you know did you know dig down and and that's why what you're
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:52.480]  doing here so sure sure but I mean my point is you you're the victim of
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:55.320]  sock puppet stuff so am I and it doesn't bother me to be lied about the
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:46:00.040]  tact except it bothers me that people that are just now waking up get diverted
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:05.320]  with you know I work for this I work for that no no I built this myself with my
[01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:08.960]  listeners support and I have all these guests on and we have film contest that
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:14.800]  reach you know 10 million people and and and we're having a huge effect and the
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:18.840]  co-intell pro just like they use on the black Panthers is I'm a fed I'm bad blah
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:23.960]  blah blah but but no it's the people saying that that are I will assure every
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:27.800]  listener viewer that I have been through your the facility here there is no
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:32.960]  secret NSA office not like Microsoft has across the street Baltimore Washington
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:37.920]  Parkway for the NSA headquarters where they work closely with NSA there's the
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:43.920]  others no there's no secret NSA office here FBI office I you know I've looked
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:47.880]  I've been through the whole facility it's a it's a bootstrap operation but
[01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:51.520]  that's the point is that is that I know I've had victories and I've seen other
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:56.320]  people do huge things who take action and the general public cannot believe
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:47:00.800]  that someone could be successful they cannot believe that that that someone
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:05.400]  could do something when all I've seen is good people take action we have victories
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:10.320]  and it's just it's so frustrating to see people not be able to believe that they
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:13.200]  can have an effect the people were fighting are just people like us as well
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:17.280]  well if you've been fed a steady diet for so long of Anderson Cooper and
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:23.880]  Pierce Morgan and an Ed Schultz I mean it isn't funny how Ed Schultz changed the
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:28.080]  whole story on Snowden saying I think the guy I think the guy's a trader I
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:31.680]  think the guy did the wrong thing you know but it was let's get back and start
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:36.400]  talking about you know you know that what's happening in Wisconsin and with
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:40.560]  the unions and all that's all important but you know he's a diversionary guy that's
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:45.760]  why he and he got fired from his show and get replaced by this this policy
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:50.520]  wonky guy Chris Hayes so why is he still why is he still following why have we
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:55.440]  never I've never seen such a totally transparent operation where the
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:59.200]  White House the Pentagon the whole system is not having people behind the scenes
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:03.480]  now they're putting them all in the positions of the actual pundits we have
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:08.480]  a state-run media absolutely these you know when I saw pundits reporting on the
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:12.280]  plane crash the Oziana plane crash in San Francisco you don't have pundits
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:16.200]  reporting on plane crashes you have reporters reporting on plane crashes
[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:21.280]  these people are not journalists by trade they're lawyers they're political
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:25.480]  hacks and so that's what's wrong with the media you were talking about that
[01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:28.680]  last night how you know 20 30 years ago you go to the press club it was real
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:32.040]  reporters now I mean there's no journalism what is it oh no there's
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:36.320]  nobody there I mean they they've seen her better days it used to be four deep
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:40.280]  with real journalists there at the at that the bar at happy hour they'd all be
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:43.960]  talking about the you know their stories of course they don't want to you know
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:47.800]  them ripping each other off but you know there was a lot more camaraderie it was
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:52.480]  real journalists now what you got our PR flax you got lawyers you got you know
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:56.920]  some some people that just you know they had they don't even know what you
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:00.600]  you're working they don't understand what what the news is well that's right
[01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:04.560]  most operatives of the globalists are into are totally want to go play golf
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:10.080]  visit their mistress and they're totally lazy they just take a press release
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:13.200]  from the central government repeated that's why I'm saying our enemy is
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:16.800]  actually pretty weak they don't even know how to think anymore you were talking
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:20.280]  about the old days people are really smart right I mean it's just it's it's
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:24.200]  bizarre I when I use the when I first became a member of the press club I I
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:29.280]  was able to talk to guys who covered the Kennedy assassination Oswald being shot
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:34.560]  guys like Ike Pappas who was with WNEW in Dallas who who Oswald brushed up
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:39.200]  against I mean Jack Ruby brushed up against the shoot Oswald so you know
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:42.720]  these are the real the real journalists but now they're saying they may even get
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:46.640]  rid of press conferences and have an Obama hologram who isn't even him but
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:50.680]  his voice delivery max headroom yeah that the talking points and there's gonna
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:54.480]  they're already saying they're gonna have robots right the news yeah I mean you
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:58.880]  and you got you know you got the Jay Carney and I mean the guy looks like
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:02.840]  Doogie Howser you know and here's his he's the press secretary why would why
[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:06.800]  would Gibbs go on TV and go yeah we lied to you and said there were no drone
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:10.560]  programs when it was an admitted program and he said the funny thing is this is
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:14.840]  admitted to exist but I say it doesn't and they all laugh like it's fun as a
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:20.520]  joke on their viewers what is that it's inside baseball you know there's a list
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:24.200]  when they have a press conference who they go to first this why they went
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:28.920]  after Helen Thomas when they you know the same sock puppets went after her when
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:32.760]  she was caught with a camera that would had been snuck into the White House he
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:35.720]  was in the White House how do you get a camera hidden camera there you gotta go
[01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:40.040]  through secret service checks it's like what happened to Dan rather these the
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:46.640]  small group of these these yellers and shouters on the internet can take down

[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:31.000]  now about a month ago Wayne Madsen was on with this thing about two weeks ago and
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:36.240]  he talked about being part of the EU Commission more than a decade ago he
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:41.000]  talked about all the admissions James Bamford's book ABC News about how
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:45.880]  decades ago really back to World War two Europe the NSA all of it shares the
[01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:51.440]  data they use foreigners to listen to us so that if anything too sensitive comes
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:56.400]  out it doesn't cause a scandal here in the US this is like talking about you
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:54:59.520]  know that Disney World is an Orlando and them saying it doesn't exist there's the
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:03.920]  Irish Times Snowden claims Germany is in bed with NSA that came out about a week
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:07.440]  after Wayne Madsen was on two weeks ago now I'm gonna play a clip from seeing in
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:11.520]  this weekend reliable sources because they told you they were reliable like the
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:15.000]  Patriot acts patriotic just butchers the Bill of Rights or drug and half the
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:19.280]  school kids it's called new freedom or all of this Orwellian or homeland security
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:23.160]  actually makes this insecure but they call it homeland security and then and
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:26.840]  they go oh it made the rounds they retracted their story on Wayne Madsen
[01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:33.160]  but the problem is they didn't retract they denotist erased it and then days
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:39.280]  after they retracted it comes out everywhere that it's true but they just
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:43.280]  hope they're moron viewers and we're talking about maybe 200,000 I mean
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:47.200]  with these be like 10 million so they're talking to I guess themselves I guess it
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:50.520]  kind of gives the talking point orders out though because then it is regurgitated
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:54.320]  by the rest of the media so the dinosaur media all vomiting together can still
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:57.600]  be a pretty good bucket size whereas before one of these guys could turn
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:02.920]  around and spray political diarrhea over our entire country but they are shadows
[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:06.560]  of their former selves and I hate to use gross analogies but it's all I've got
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:10.360]  I mean it's what I think of when I look at them but I mean wait it's an AP
[01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:13.880]  Reuters everything now that okay Snowden's in bigger trouble and Germany's
[01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:18.320]  embarrassed okay we're spying it used to be getting a Pulitzer prize Bob but
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:22.520]  instead they're saying things like this to their moron viewers here it is odd
[01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:27.040]  turn this past week when it's sister paper the observer ran a front page story
[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:31.920]  that claimed European officials had reached a secret deal with the NSA to
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:37.520]  turn over private data to the USA now that sure sounds scandalous but here's
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:42.920]  the thing the article based its claims on a single very unreliable source and a
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:46.960]  story is conspiracy theorist named Wayne Madsen whom reporter Jamie Dowered
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:51.120]  never even spoke with and not surprisingly the article was eventually
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:54.960]  retracted but not before it made the rounds on the internet even receiving a
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:57:02.360]  coveted drudge report link a coveted drudge report link we're about to go to
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:06.760]  break but just respond respond to that because you did talk to the paper yeah
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:11.200]  and this is all over the and you told them and they quoted stuff oh you were
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:14.560]  like look at the European Commission oh it was admitted 12 years ago oh yeah
[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:19.540]  they're mad because this is hiding in plain view and you're like ABCD and so
[01:57:19.540 --> 01:57:23.360]  their answer is to say you're a liar well yeah I mean it was incorrect when
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:28.760]  this guy said I hadn't spoken directly to the reporter I spoke to him on the phone
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:34.480]  and I have emails exchange emails with him before the story came out he they
[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:39.720]  know that it's called lying to their audience about 12 emails so I mean they
[01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:44.040]  get away with that the Pointer Institute which is a media watchdog ran with a
[01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:48.440]  story based on what they said and I've been in touch with them they published

[02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:48.480]  little bit earlier we're getting James O'Keefe on who brought down Acre and you
[02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:52.200]  name it so much more you know you know I'm nonpartisan a libertarian
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:55.080]  constitutionalist kind of would lean with what you call Republicans just
[02:00:55.080 --> 02:00:59.120]  because they give lip service to guns and things like that and sovereignty but
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:03.080]  the more I learn and get a little more seasoned being around Democrats watching
[02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:07.280]  them am I wrong in saying Republicans are like this big imperial starship
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:11.320]  corruption and just labishing themselves in country clubs and helicopters
[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:16.240]  Democrats are like they have their mafia level and they're slick as well but
[02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:21.480]  grassroots this is really gangsters these are these these really are cuz in any
[02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:25.960]  operation they're involved in or even their low-level people you find out will
[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:30.400]  tell you yeah we're gangsters and they're all involved in crimes and things I
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:35.720]  mean from your research of Democrats who are they well I mean look at the
[02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:39.720]  veterans of the Obama administration Rahm Emanuel the mayor of Chicago he's a
[02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:43.880]  thug he's a gangster look what he's doing in Chicago public school system and
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:49.440]  he's benefiting from this Penny Pritzker who was Obama's number one fundraiser in
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:55.000]  Chicago is now the Commerce Secretary he breathes through a nomination there
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:00.160]  wasn't a question asked about her her unsavory ties in Chicago she's the
[02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:06.720]  heiress to the Hyatt Hotel fortune also has to do with a lot of things get a lot
[02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:12.160]  of information that arose in Chicago about Hyatt maybe benefiting from the
[02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:17.480]  introduction of casino gambling of course the Navy Pier on Lake Michigan so
[02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:22.640]  yes he's mobbed up so yeah they tend the Democrats who support Obama tend to
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:27.240]  be more of the what we would expect to find from big-city machine politics you
[02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:30.320]  know Obama gets fake excited when he's lying to old ladies saying I'll get your
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:33.880]  free house all this stuff but when he does these gay and lesbian events he
[02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:38.480]  really gets excited and acts really weird and I I mean I just the body
[02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:43.040]  language my gaydar goes off with Obama I mean yeah I mean we we know about his
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:46.720]  background now from Chicago he's tried to cover it up you know my issue is they
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:50.440]  can use it for blackmail oh that's that was the whole point you know whether
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:56.280]  you agree with it or not you know back when there were you know being a
[02:02:56.280 --> 02:03:00.960]  homosexual was considered to be a highly blackmail okay we had Jagger Hoover at
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:06.320]  the FBI but the the the word that was the whole point the mob was running him it
[02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:09.520]  was all blackmail right they were running him it was all that you could be
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:15.080]  blackmailed because there was such a social stigma attached to it that you
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:18.520]  wouldn't want the information to come out it's different now but that's what
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:22.920]  the original idea was back in the day when they investigated well I'm told by
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:30.160]  Hollywood and this is also coming out in the Vatican that you've almost got to
[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:33.280]  be involved in that to be part of it now it's like we're learning about this
[02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:37.320]  mafia and hip-hop where they tell them you know you gotta come to the party and
[02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:40.680]  do this if you're gonna be in the club I mean that that's really weird you know
[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:44.080]  all through the history you read books on the history of Hollywood and you find
[02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:49.440]  out not only actresses had to wind up on the directors casting couch but a lot
[02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:54.800]  of male actors as well and some very big names or were associated with that
[02:03:54.800 --> 02:03:58.560]  people would be I just don't I just don't get it I guess it's the power isn't
[02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:03.600]  it is power I think Henry Kissinger who I despise is as the only unindicted
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:07.960]  work from the great aphrodisiac is power exactly that's what he said and that in
[02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:11.720]  that respect that's the one thing that he'll always be remembered for because
[02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:16.360]  that's absolutely true what he said and reportedly Kissinger is quite the horn
[02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:21.160]  dog well he's up in years now but yeah remember he used to be considered quite
[02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:26.320]  the bachelor with the dating starlets Jill St. John and you know what's
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:30.880]  disgusting as it was in a couple newspapers that the Prince of Darkness
[02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:36.800]  Pearl goes to parties and to women and says I control lots of stuff and kill
[02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:40.960]  lots of people and he thinks that like shows off to women and even those our

[02:08:25.880 --> 02:08:32.920]  don't trust Congress and don't trust federal judges to make sure that we're
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:37.000]  abiding by the Constitution due process and rule of law then we're gonna have
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:45.600]  some problems. The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind and
[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:51.120]  remember Obama said we shouldn't listen to these people that warn about tyranny
[02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:54.840]  around the corner well it didn't run the corner it's sitting on top of us we
[02:08:54.840 --> 02:08:59.040]  can't trust federal judges the federal there's total illegal spying across the
[02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:05.280]  board it's been public for at least 15 years. Wayne Madsen goes here media look
[02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:08.520]  at this European Commission admitting the sharing the data all these
[02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:11.800]  governments are lying blaming it on the US they're all involved they're like
[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:16.720]  this man's crazy you know he pointed out admitted facts and Snowden all Snowden's
[02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:20.240]  in trouble in my view and I want your brief take on this and take calls we're
[02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:24.120]  gonna trade on Martin in the whole case and about to go to the jury and we got
[02:09:24.120 --> 02:09:27.240]  the Veritas project head joining us with his book to get he'll give us take on
[02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:33.280]  that as well but his real crime is they don't want the moral authority of
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:37.720]  someone in government because they've endowed that with godlike status to say
[02:09:37.720 --> 02:09:41.640]  no we're spying on the press and the people and the government's out of
[02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:44.880]  control and Bradley Manning says we were killing innocent people like a kid
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:48.600]  burning bugs with a magnifying glass they don't want the government
[02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:53.160]  politically vocal just like they're arresting CIA guys that go yeah we did
[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:56.400]  illegally torture well you're not supposed to get arrested for whistle-blowing
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:02.760]  exposing a crime so it's unprecedented and only Obama could get away with this
[02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:07.400]  show I mean why do you I mean do you think that's known as big crime yeah
[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:15.280]  look Obama has brought more espionage act violations the 1917 espionage act
[02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:20.400]  put in by Woodrow Wilson he's brought more charges under the espionage act than
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:25.600]  any other previous president combined Snowden being the last the latest one
[02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:29.800]  Tom Drake it's not as espionage is to give missile secrets to the Chinese
[02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:34.040]  oops our government did that by partisan a very good intelligence agency
[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:37.240]  asset president that's what he was designed to do that's what he was
[02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:46.120]  groomed to do that's what he's doing so yeah I mean spying on the Associated
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:50.160]  Press over a hundred reporters and editors at the AP James Rosen of Fox News
[02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:54.800]  the list goes on and on trying to get the Jim Ryzen from now they're saying
[02:10:54.800 --> 02:11:00.280]  they may indict Rupert Murdoch and look I know obviously the spying scandal not
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:04.800]  good over there in England but compared to the Justice Department and all the
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:08.880]  stuff it's doing what a magnitude of a thousand times right so you know the
[02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:14.960]  deal the situation is is that some people said what Obama's done is
[02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:19.520]  criminalized investigative journalism and it's true the president the AP Gary
[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:23.400]  Pruitt told the press club couple weeks ago all our sources have gone cold on us
[02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:26.560]  they don't want their fear and that's why they killed Hastings because he said
[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:30.920]  all of us have to unite America's being taken down they've declared war on us
[02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:34.560]  we declare war on them release all the info have courage they would have courage
[02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:40.200]  boom right right briefly on on on Hastings I had his buddies staff sergeant
[02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:44.800]  Biggs on yesterday I mean now it's come out they basically killed him yeah it
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:49.720]  doesn't pass the smell test I mean we had Richard Clark even suggest the former
[02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:54.000]  counterterrorism guy that you know you can manipulate in Mercedes I after a
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:58.040]  princess Diana died in the crash in Paris I was in Paris right after that and
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:03.200]  and it was quite clear the French police is that somebody has sped that car up
[02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:08.040]  inside the tunnel and causing it to crash at a high rate rate of speed so
[02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:11.600]  yes that technology's been around an awful long time well no kidding they
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:16.240]  got robot Google cars driving around absolutely ridiculous they had robot
[02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:21.240]  cars remote control by radio control 80 years ago absolutely so whether it was
[02:12:21.240 --> 02:12:25.920]  that or a bomb clearly it was a bomb it was sabotage they sabotage
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:29.720]  witnesses said it was driving and blew up on the road the engine shot the
[02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:33.620]  opposite direction right right so it's a it looks like if it happened in Bay
[02:12:33.620 --> 02:12:37.840]  Root or Damascus there'd be no question as to whether it was it was a terrorist
[02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:41.320]  it maybe that's the new thing maybe like special forces jumps out puts a bomb on
[02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:45.720]  you they go up ropes and helicopters you blow up and they go spontaneous
[02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:49.600]  combustion let's go to some phone calls here Mike in Oregon you're on the air

[02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:13.720]  Austrian police do the same thing especially with immigrants you do not

[02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:54.380]  go ahead and talk to chase in Texas welcome to the airwaves well thank you
[02:14:54.380 --> 02:14:58.240]  Starsman a while and I'm glad to be here and you on 1300 out of Beaumont
[02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:02.240]  Texas sorry sure as good to hear y'all but the truth here that's right you're
[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:06.880]  listening on KSET 1300 I never plug stations like I should everybody in
[02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:10.160]  Beaumont I got feelings from Beaumont on my grandmother side to my mom's side
[02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:13.920]  everybody in Beaumont he's just spread the word that we're on there God bless
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:18.520]  that station go ahead sir yes sir and in my younger misguided youth you know I
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:22.640]  was I was very overzealous at the top I think at first as far as calling in a
[02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:28.240]  little over the top and and pushing this so my question for Mr. Madsen is is
[02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:33.000]  if saying these things and and doing that obviously you're going to be on the
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:37.280]  list and kind of like what John Hancock said I want my name at the top of the
[02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:42.520]  list though I don't want to die I love life I'm a Christian what do you stand
[02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:47.360]  as far as if you call in one time on Washington Journal on any of these shows
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:53.640]  and you and they kind of do they rat hole you into an area where we'll save
[02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:58.160]  this person for another day or he fits into this but what you do is you
[02:15:58.160 --> 02:16:02.120]  say I'm an American I'm a Liberty lover I'm a constitutionalist and they want to
[02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:05.680]  call you independent liberal conservative just say I'm liberal because
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:09.920]  Thomas Jefferson was a liberal well these terms mean nothing now just say
[02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:13.640]  whatever gets you on the air I mean don't lie but just say oh I'm a liberal
[02:16:13.640 --> 02:16:17.280]  because a real liberal would be against all this tyranny or I'm a
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:22.200]  conservative I want to conserve the old liberal values that made this country so
[02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:26.040]  great it was liberal to own a gun it was liberal to own your own property was
[02:16:26.040 --> 02:16:30.440]  liberal to be free the liberal means more freedom not less freedom say they've
[02:16:30.440 --> 02:16:35.240]  stolen all these terms and God bless you sir good to have you listening there
[02:16:35.240 --> 02:16:43.680]  in Beaumont Texas what do you call yourself Wayne I I consider myself a
[02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:51.480]  pretty much a populist I look at FDR as a good president I think he helped the
[02:16:51.480 --> 02:16:55.080]  people in this country when the people needed now we can argue about what he
[02:16:55.080 --> 02:16:58.960]  knew about Pearl Harbor and all that but let's look he never lived long enough to
[02:16:58.960 --> 02:17:02.560]  get the second new deal and that there was a lot of good things in there we
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:05.240]  wouldn't be having these discuss you can argue good and bad and all that but
[02:17:05.240 --> 02:17:08.960]  anything they take its collectivist will end up making people dependent but I get
[02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:12.040]  your point at least he broke up the big banks and didn't let him he broke up the
[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:15.160]  big bang to the derivatives Eddie Roosevelt who was a Republican and his
[02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:20.600]  cousin broke up to the the monopolies I mean this is these are the people we
[02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:25.280]  should be a highlight well it's not good for business to let monopolies run
[02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:28.840]  things or will turn Mexico's got monopolies do we want to live like that
[02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:31.840]  yeah I mean I look at Dwight Eisenhower is a great president the
[02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:35.240]  things he was able to do he kept us out of war he got it why doesn't he get
[02:17:35.240 --> 02:17:38.920]  credit for the Civil Rights Act and all that because you know there were people
[02:17:38.920 --> 02:17:46.400]  that back then calling Eisenhower a pinko you know I mean and then you know
[02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:50.000]  Jack Kennedy didn't live long enough to do the things he wanted to do and then
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:54.880]  we got we started then we got our first really corrupt really corrupt
[02:17:54.880 --> 02:18:00.480]  presidents Lyndon Johnson followed by Nixon by the time Jimmy car Ford was a
[02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:04.560]  placeholder he was a yes man absolutely let's German Jimmy poor Jimmy Carter
[02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:08.960]  tried and you know they set him up with the Iran hostage thing just let's go to
[02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:11.160]  Alex in Illinois you're on the air with Wayne Madsen go ahead with your
[02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:17.800]  question sir party on Wayne party on Alex yeah I was wondering if Wayne could
[02:18:17.800 --> 02:18:24.520]  elaborate on NSA slash DARPA slash CIA brain scanner eyes like a truth machine
[02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:28.600]  yeah well what these are is quack frauds just like lie detectors and they're now
[02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:32.640]  have a passive brain scanners at some airports people think that's crazy
[02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:35.680]  looking up I think five airports have it in the US last time I checked then they
[02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:40.720]  claim oh brain waves show you're agitated like yeah I'm late yeah I got an
[02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:44.920]  ulcer I mean you know it's like you're sweating well yeah it's hot in here look
[02:18:44.920 --> 02:18:49.880]  and any go back and look at any science fiction movie and I guarantee you some
[02:18:49.880 --> 02:18:54.280]  part of the US intelligence community is working on that technology and send in
[02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:57.520]  New York Times today that they've created but you know the prototype
[02:18:57.520 --> 02:19:02.560]  Terminator robot called Atlas it's a scary looking thing it's huge yeah well
[02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:06.120]  you guys print the Terminator killer robot for me well I was told by Marines
[02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:11.440]  14 years ago that they about that robot they've got a whole bunch of them right
[02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:17.480]  and I said my grandfather sold a prototype riot control it was remote
[02:19:17.480 --> 02:19:21.280]  control had these big arms with cattle prods on it and they only got their money
[02:19:21.280 --> 02:19:25.320]  back and they sold that to the Pentagon yeah it's like the movie minority report
[02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:29.680]  where they let these little nano insects robotic insects go into people's homes
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:32.720]  and spy on you already have that they have that they have that they had it when
[02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:36.800]  that came out they crawl they fly they go underwater they can do all that stuff
[02:19:36.800 --> 02:19:40.640]  yeah that was just nothing the real weapons platforms are big armor tanks
[02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:45.840]  the mini tanks that have like 10 guns on them nerve gas you name it and they
[02:19:45.840 --> 02:19:48.560]  just drew and that those things are autonomous yeah you look at this and
[02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:52.000]  you think of Charlton Heston at the final scene at Planet of the Apes they
[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:56.240]  end them all to hell they finally did it you know yeah yeah yeah exactly all a

[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:53.640]  country and good job putting this this this master workout I pray now that

[02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:08.760]  it being a citizen journalist Mr. O'Keeffe how's the book doing I hear it's
[02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:13.320]  selling pretty well yeah thanks Alex the breakthrough is a New York Times best
[02:27:13.320 --> 02:27:17.160]  seller it's gotten all positive reviews and like you said it was sort of a
[02:27:17.160 --> 02:27:21.160]  David versus Goliath struggle asymmetrical warfare we have to fight
[02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:26.320]  to subvert that complacent media and a corrupt government I have been targeted
[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:31.040]  in every way you could possibly imagine I've survived from prosecutions to
[02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:35.760]  indictments to potential indictment the Department of Justice trying to criminalize
[02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:40.120]  the First Amendment everything this book is more like a thriller than it is an
[02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:44.680]  actual political book but it's all true and it's a fascinating story and it's a
[02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:48.320]  hopeful story because you know like you said if you just don't give up you just
[02:27:48.320 --> 02:27:53.360]  keep going keep fighting you can actually break through well Jim Garrison
[02:27:53.360 --> 02:27:55.600]  said that they said why are you still alive and he said because I'm in the
[02:27:55.600 --> 02:28:01.960]  spotlight and when they persecute me and lie about me and try to set me up it
[02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:05.040]  gives me even more energy to fight them and it's actually exciting it's not
[02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:10.280]  scary is that the experience you've had well I think you're right I think if
[02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:14.760]  you're if you're in the spotlight if you're in the public realm it's less
[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:19.960]  likely they're gonna do something to you and we have a certain we have sort of
[02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:25.080]  they run out of arrows in their quiver so to speak but I mean this book takes
[02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:29.720]  you in the trenches it shows you that the Department of Justice will instead of
[02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:34.320]  looking you know instead of working in Massachusetts they were trying to track
[02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:40.720]  me down the FBI they've just a federal judge to lead the evidence I have had
[02:28:40.720 --> 02:28:44.640]  defamation lawsuits settle I've used the proceeds of those defamation lawsuits to
[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:49.120]  fund more investigation it's really incredible what you can accomplish if
[02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:53.680]  you just focus on the truth and we use we call it Veritas Veritas Latin for
[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:58.440]  truth cinema verite exposing things for what they really are and there's really
[02:28:58.440 --> 02:29:02.800]  no way around it but I think at this point the good news is that you we've
[02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:07.240]  gotten to such a position of prominence in the public spotlight I don't think
[02:29:07.240 --> 02:29:10.480]  they'll be able to shut us down now you are incredible and again you've gone
[02:29:10.480 --> 02:29:16.040]  through the storm I'm sure there'll be more that come but as you said in a way
[02:29:16.040 --> 02:29:20.280]  you and others we're starting to break them they want to demoralize us we're
[02:29:20.280 --> 02:29:23.240]  demoralizing them with the truth and they're they're beginning to dawn on
[02:29:23.240 --> 02:29:27.680]  them as their viewers collapse as their poll numbers collapse that this is only
[02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:31.840]  the beginning no amount of two billion bullets or brainwashing or race war is
[02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:37.360]  going to help them Liberty is rising and in that fist smashing the tyrant

[02:33:41.400 --> 02:33:46.320]  how-to book to be a real investigative journalist and how to change history
[02:33:46.320 --> 02:33:50.480]  because the globalist and their forces are so corrupt if you just point out
[02:33:50.480 --> 02:33:53.640]  what they're doing is wrong when they're on MSNBC in promo saying your
[02:33:53.640 --> 02:33:59.080]  children don't belong to you they belong to the state or you know when they're on
[02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:03.360]  TV saying we now have an app out to report all gun owners and put them in a
[02:34:03.360 --> 02:34:07.280]  database for the public and then people get sued over that like when
[02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:12.480]  newspapers publish you know where gun owners live I mean it's time to stop
[02:34:12.480 --> 02:34:16.160]  groveling to these people you pick a target politically do the right thing
[02:34:16.160 --> 02:34:20.760]  stand up for yourself the evil will collapse Thomas Jefferson said all
[02:34:20.760 --> 02:34:24.240]  the evil men in tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do
[02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:29.200]  nothing the book breakthrough our guerrilla war to expose fraud and save
[02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:33.560]  democracy James O'Keeffe it is an absolute tour de force ladies and
[02:34:33.560 --> 02:34:39.040]  gentlemen and you need to get it at infowarstore.com and you need to give it
[02:34:39.040 --> 02:34:43.600]  to friends and family and you need to let them know that this fight is going
[02:34:43.600 --> 02:34:48.840]  on because anytime I see people start standing up and start questioning even
[02:34:48.840 --> 02:34:51.840]  if it's your city council with local stuff going on you start getting big
[02:34:51.840 --> 02:34:55.680]  results and at first they act all powerful and all arrogant but after a
[02:34:55.680 --> 02:34:59.400]  couple years if you just start once a month going out videotape but something
[02:34:59.400 --> 02:35:04.320]  doing something you will wreck them that's why they laugh and act arrogant
[02:35:04.320 --> 02:35:09.560]  they don't laugh later they squeal ladies and gentlemen and I mean I'm
[02:35:09.560 --> 02:35:12.880]  describing what I've been through you've seen what James O'Keeffe has done
[02:35:12.880 --> 02:35:16.520]  really I've told my reporters that's why our reporters I said do stuff like
[02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:21.640]  veritas let's start we already do some of this but I said let's get
[02:35:21.640 --> 02:35:26.880]  really aggressive and again you don't have to get to this level of like you
[02:35:26.880 --> 02:35:34.360]  know NFL dream team you know NFL a Super Bowl level of this right away in
[02:35:34.360 --> 02:35:37.720]  fact you probably never will maybe you don't want to that's when it gets
[02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:41.880]  dangerous the little stuff is easy and not dangerous so get the book infowar
[02:35:41.880 --> 02:35:46.000]  store.com talk about some of the stories in the book talk about the entire
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:50.920]  and currently you know to what you see the Obamanoids doing talking about
[02:35:50.920 --> 02:35:57.640]  criminal charges against News Corp and Rupert Murdoch in the US over reporters
[02:35:57.640 --> 02:36:03.760]  talking to cops in England. Yeah Alex this is this is sort of the mainstreaming
[02:36:03.760 --> 02:36:08.560]  of the criminalization of journalism people thought I was crazy a couple
[02:36:08.560 --> 02:36:11.480]  years ago when I talked about how the Department of Justice was leaking my
[02:36:11.480 --> 02:36:16.160]  emails people thought I was nuts in fact now with the news scandals everyone
[02:36:16.160 --> 02:36:19.920]  believes me we had reason to believe that the US Attorney's Office and
[02:36:19.920 --> 02:36:25.260]  Louisiana was leaking my emails now we see Glenn Greenwald you have David
[02:36:25.260 --> 02:36:29.520]  Gregory at NBC News talking about how he's aiding in the bedding a source I
[02:36:29.520 --> 02:36:33.680]  mean they're literally the establishment people are talking are calling for the
[02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:38.400]  criminalization of the news reporting and why have been on the front lines I
[02:36:38.400 --> 02:36:43.840]  have I have count on the absolute front lines of this I had agents come to my
[02:36:43.840 --> 02:36:48.360]  house for three years federal agents harassing my family I had them almost
[02:36:48.360 --> 02:36:52.520]  raid the home of one of my colleagues for exposing voter fraud in the state of
[02:36:52.520 --> 02:36:57.800]  Hampshire even though our expose they showing dead people voting led to the
[02:36:57.800 --> 02:37:03.320]  state passing a voter identification law so we have been on the front lines as
[02:37:03.320 --> 02:37:08.080]  citizen and at this turning point in our country we have to establish the left
[02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:11.840]  and the right have to come together on the first amendment and I don't see that
[02:37:11.840 --> 02:37:16.320]  happening I see a rift I see some people being protected I see the Department
[02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:19.920]  Justice protecting certain journalists and prosecuting other journalists based
[02:37:19.920 --> 02:37:24.080]  on the information they exposed this book there's so many stories I mean I
[02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:31.240]  don't even know where to begin but it's all about that that fight that fight you
[02:37:31.240 --> 02:37:34.240]  know I want to play a clip here in a few minutes what did you think of Hastings
[02:37:34.240 --> 02:37:38.600]  and now that they won't release the report of what they did with his body
[02:37:38.600 --> 02:37:42.840]  I've talked to the family I've talked to his friends the family scared to come on
[02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:47.680]  air I've talked to staff Sergeant Biggs about he said I'm going into hiding
[02:37:47.680 --> 02:37:52.680]  they're death-threading me biggest story ever CIA they're coming to all our
[02:37:52.680 --> 02:37:56.520]  houses and the FBI lied now I've talked to people that went to the funeral they
[02:37:56.520 --> 02:38:00.600]  were visited by the FBI the FBI lied about visiting them and then his car
[02:38:00.600 --> 02:38:06.200]  blows up and then where's the so-called big left media they're making fun of
[02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:11.360]  anybody that questions his death and I mean it's pretty much open and shut it
[02:38:11.360 --> 02:38:14.720]  was a car bomb from what I've seen well what what interests me about Hastings
[02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:18.320]  I'm glad you brought him up is that I was I was reading a little bit about
[02:38:18.320 --> 02:38:21.800]  looking into him because I think toward the end of his life Michael Hastings
[02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:26.320]  had a little bit of an awakening about our media and he gave an interview with
[02:38:26.320 --> 02:38:32.280]  I think it was Chen Unger I don't know where I saw on YouTube and he was
[02:38:32.280 --> 02:38:36.320]  saying that he had to leave Newsweek because in Newsweek his hands were tied
[02:38:36.320 --> 02:38:39.440]  he said he could he had to go into the wilderness as he called it he had to
[02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:44.240]  become independent he had to branch out and freelance right for Rolling Stone
[02:38:44.240 --> 02:38:48.320]  which is a little more of a rag that Newsweek was and I see it I see it all
[02:38:48.320 --> 02:38:53.040]  over the media I see reporters they have to be independent in order to get the
[02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:57.920]  truth out they have to branch out and leave these established papers with
[02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:01.120]  big salaries he was talking about his editors wouldn't let him do what he wanted
[02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:05.280]  to do and I think this is unfortunately where we are we have to be independent
[02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:09.120]  people we have to take it upon ourselves could you know what does that mean it
[02:39:09.120 --> 02:39:12.760]  means that the First Amendment needs to protect the people who become independent
[02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:17.680]  in fact the established groups they're not even doing journalism anymore so it's
[02:39:17.680 --> 02:39:22.320]  it's really shocking to see the Justice Department you know protecting the guy
[02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:25.800]  who bugged McConnell who committed a felony through you know take them through
[02:39:25.800 --> 02:39:30.560]  a wall he's considered a journalist you know Daniel Ellberg is considered a
[02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:33.480]  hero and all these other people are considered heroes but now the citizens
[02:39:33.480 --> 02:39:37.920]  who actually do the journalism are prosecuted and by the way next week I'll
[02:39:37.920 --> 02:39:42.120]  be releasing a video actually confronted the corrupt United States attorneys
[02:39:42.120 --> 02:39:46.240]  to prosecute me and you will not believe what they did in response they you
[02:39:46.240 --> 02:39:51.360]  were unbelievable footage it's coming next week at Project Veritas well the
[02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:54.160]  clip we played a few weeks ago Hastings said they've declared war on
[02:39:54.160 --> 02:39:58.160]  journalists they've declared war on liberty and it's time that the
[02:39:58.160 --> 02:40:01.360]  journalists stand together and just release everything this corrupt
[02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:08.080]  government's doing and I think that scared him because he was a leader and I
[02:40:08.080 --> 02:40:12.560]  just can't believe other than some TV stations in LA and San Diego none of
[02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:17.920]  them are saying there's a cover-up this should be investigated well I mean like
[02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:20.880]  I said I think Hastings was having a little bit of an awakening toward the end
[02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:25.840]  of his life but I think there's a there's like a false dichotomy on the
[02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:29.160]  left and the right you know I think Hastings was kind of seeing that false
[02:40:29.160 --> 02:40:33.240]  dichotomy a little bit that that I think we all need to come together and support
[02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:37.160]  the first done it Alex there's stories in this book breakthrough where I was
[02:40:37.160 --> 02:40:40.320]  researching all types of things the last three years I would I wasn't allowed to
[02:40:40.320 --> 02:40:44.360]  travel the government would not let me travel over misdemeanor crime I didn't
[02:40:44.360 --> 02:40:48.120]  even commit so I was in the library in New Jersey investigating the National
[02:40:48.120 --> 02:40:52.360]  Education Association and the librarian came up to me and said now what are you
[02:40:52.360 --> 02:40:56.400]  doing here I said well I'm doing it I'm a reporter I'm investigating you know
[02:40:56.400 --> 02:41:00.240]  voter fraud in the education education association and she said why are you
[02:41:00.240 --> 02:41:04.140]  doing that no no you can't do that so I discovered that I'm always behind enemy
[02:41:04.140 --> 02:41:08.400]  lines oh I know I don't call these people liberals and again I'm a
[02:41:08.400 --> 02:41:12.920]  constitutional libertarian obviously Republicans talk more like I like
[02:41:12.920 --> 02:41:19.720]  sovereignty family anti-abortion pro-life things like that but of course then
[02:41:19.720 --> 02:41:23.080]  they sell us out because they're part of the same power structure but the
[02:41:23.080 --> 02:41:28.660]  Democrats even their rank and file the old well-meaning liberals now no
[02:41:28.660 --> 02:41:32.320]  Democrats are bad and they're awakened or more of like a libertarian liberal but
[02:41:32.320 --> 02:41:36.160]  those that are still behind it think they're part of like an authoritarian
[02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:40.320]  club and they'll come over to our reporters in Austin and go when they
[02:41:40.320 --> 02:41:42.960]  were just talking to someone on the street you know one in a suit interviewing
[02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:45.440]  people and go I don't think you're allowed to be on the street interviewing
[02:41:45.440 --> 02:41:49.800]  I'm calling the police and then the police come I mean they call the police
[02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:53.600]  on us when we're handing out magazines and the cops come and go yeah you can't
[02:41:53.600 --> 02:41:58.640]  do that it's upsetting people I think there's a distinction I'm glad you
[02:41:58.640 --> 02:42:02.000]  brought this up I think there's a this because I've spent many much much time
[02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:05.400]  thinking about this because it affected me in a very personal way there's a
[02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:10.440]  different criticism and censorship and what I see is I see sometimes I described
[02:42:10.440 --> 02:42:14.760]  this in breakthrough liberalism that yielded to fascism and there is a there
[02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:18.440]  is a distinct difference between why this silence and people and shut down
[02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:22.520]  information and have a conversation with that information mean in my case they
[02:42:22.520 --> 02:42:25.640]  want to shut me down they want to censor me they know that's what I'm saying is
[02:42:25.640 --> 02:42:30.560]  that they're they're authoritarians and they'll laugh at me and say yeah I know
[02:42:30.560 --> 02:42:36.680]  we're taken over it's like Democrats now don't care of Obama kills bombs or even
[02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:41.920]  rips them off it's like they feel like they're part of an evil team it means
[02:42:41.920 --> 02:42:44.920]  like when you went in all the acre offices are like you got child sex slaves
[02:42:44.920 --> 02:42:49.760]  or whatever you got underage prostitutes bring them all you know be I mean it's
[02:42:49.760 --> 02:42:55.840]  scary that the rank and you get my point I mean have you picked up on the average
[02:42:55.840 --> 02:43:01.480]  Democrat being like a criminal well I mean I see the Department of Justice is
[02:43:01.480 --> 02:43:07.000]  like I said protecting as a guy who who planted a listening device through wall
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:10.520]  which you know maybe you argue that's justified still it's still a
[02:43:10.520 --> 02:43:15.360]  pest felony and they're protecting him and they're prosecuting my colleagues
[02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:20.600]  who did nothing illegal so I'm actually I've lived it I have lived it I see the
[02:43:20.600 --> 02:43:24.560]  censorship I I want the left and the right to come together on this issue I
[02:43:24.560 --> 02:43:29.240]  think it's possible for the left and the right to come together on this issue of
[02:43:29.240 --> 02:43:33.520]  we should not support censorship but I see these people this is what they say
[02:43:33.520 --> 02:43:37.080]  to me say Alex you shouldn't be investigating a corn you should not be
[02:43:37.080 --> 02:43:41.180]  investigating election fraud you should not be doing because these are good
[02:43:41.180 --> 02:43:45.240]  things you don't want to go after good organization and it's the it's the it's
[02:43:45.240 --> 02:43:48.760]  the moral statement that you shouldn't be doing something because you're
[02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:53.360]  investigating good people and I was like we're doing bad things because we're
[02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:56.880]  good did you see I think they signed the law yesterday well you guys try to pull
[02:43:56.880 --> 02:44:02.560]  it up if you can we're five non-citizens at one time can run the polling places
[02:44:02.560 --> 02:44:08.880]  they pass laws so non-citizens can run the polling places and probably vote
[02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:12.960]  over and over again in California did you see that I didn't see that news item
[02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:17.640]  though I'll pull it up it's it's so insane I covered it yesterday but yeah
[02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:22.120]  yeah no California I think the headline was the passes law where immigrants can
[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:27.200]  run polling places it really is crazy I want to play you this Hastings clip this
[02:44:27.200 --> 02:44:30.480]  is about a week before he died with the young Turks and I've checked it
[02:44:30.480 --> 02:44:36.120]  sink eager or whatever his name is I hunger how do you say it yes hunger he's
[02:44:36.120 --> 02:44:40.000]  been on the show but I think he's a funny guy but the whole I wasn't missed his
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:43.440]  name on purpose is my point folks I'm babbling here but you know I don't think
[02:44:43.440 --> 02:44:46.440]  he's come out and said it should be investigated he broke down and cried for
[02:44:46.440 --> 02:44:50.960]  his friend but won't dare say it's suspicious because all the government
[02:44:50.960 --> 02:44:54.360]  never does anything wrong let's play this clip here it is the Obama
[02:44:54.360 --> 02:44:59.240]  administration has clearly declared war on on the press it's a good war on
[02:44:59.240 --> 02:45:04.040]  investigative journalists are sources I think the only recourse to this kind of
[02:45:04.040 --> 02:45:08.400]  behavior by the government is to say back to the government we declare war on
[02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:12.680]  you and from this point forward we should no longer as as a media as a whole
[02:45:12.680 --> 02:45:17.320]  cooperate in any manner with with with the government in terms of when we're
[02:45:17.320 --> 02:45:20.960]  doing national security stories we should withdraw all our cooperation and we
[02:45:20.960 --> 02:45:24.640]  should publish everything we know because it's a free press it's not a free
[02:45:24.640 --> 02:45:27.680]  except for when the government tells me to do it press and it would be been way
[02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:30.720]  too way too easy going with these guys we've let them get away with this for
[02:45:30.720 --> 02:45:34.320]  years we've let them tell us what to print what not to print and I say I say
[02:45:34.320 --> 02:45:37.160]  be done with it and everybody should just get together and fire back because
[02:45:37.160 --> 02:45:41.840]  no one else is gonna defend the press all right and that's sink hunger I can
[02:45:41.840 --> 02:45:47.480]  also pronounce my own name folks I'm sorry but I mean sink but don't get them
[02:45:47.480 --> 02:45:51.400]  on the show again last time I couldn't go on his shows maybe he's mad at me but
[02:45:51.400 --> 02:45:55.920]  try to get him on the show he's always asked for notice I mean where are you
[02:45:55.920 --> 02:46:01.760]  where is current TV I guess unbiologist here on this very suspicious death of
[02:46:01.760 --> 02:46:06.600]  this journalist again what do you think of what Hastings just said from the
[02:46:06.600 --> 02:46:11.600]  grave well I think I think Hastings writing to you like I said before he
[02:46:11.600 --> 02:46:15.840]  was having an awakening you have to go through a lot of cognitive business do
[02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:22.320]  that I also think that Hastings was was disillusioned by what he saw as his
[02:46:22.320 --> 02:46:28.920]  press corps like Newsweek which he worked for before was what his hand was
[02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:32.640]  tied they were not allowing him to print the stuff he wanted to print he said he
[02:46:32.640 --> 02:46:36.440]  had to go out into the wilderness as he put it and go completely independent and
[02:46:36.440 --> 02:46:40.920]  you know he got to the war you know I confronted the US Attorney who prosecuted
[02:46:40.920 --> 02:46:46.560]  me the other day and this guy screamed that he lost control himself he called
[02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:50.920]  the sheriff he wanted to put me in jail they just they're drunk with power they're
[02:46:50.920 --> 02:46:55.920]  drunk with power and they want to use that power to shut people down and we
[02:46:55.920 --> 02:47:00.920]  have to stand together I mean we have to do exactly is that the video that's
[02:47:00.920 --> 02:47:06.400]  coming out next week yeah yeah he this guy it's all on KP he lost this is a
[02:47:06.400 --> 02:47:12.600]  former United States Attorney who resigned for corruption related issues in
[02:47:12.600 --> 02:47:17.240]  Louisiana and I confronted them with my book I said sir what why did you do what
[02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:21.120]  did I just ask them a simple question I was very kind I was very nice I said yeah
[02:47:21.120 --> 02:47:25.560]  here's a copy my book I'd like you to see it and I want you to give you a I
[02:47:25.560 --> 02:47:29.720]  want to give you a chance to respond to what you've done you took three years of
[02:47:29.720 --> 02:47:34.000]  my life from me your your leadership team engaged in corrupt activities we
[02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:37.840]  have reasonably be leaking my emails why did you do it and he lost control of
[02:47:37.840 --> 02:47:41.560]  it can't wait to see that well listen I went and walked around July 4th in
[02:47:41.560 --> 02:47:45.440]  downtown Austin on a hiking bike trail and I was shooting short little videos
[02:47:45.440 --> 02:47:49.480]  over the pedestrian walk bridge and later I noticed the man and woman that
[02:47:49.480 --> 02:47:52.760]  confronted me were like 30 plus feet away couldn't even hear me I was being
[02:47:52.760 --> 02:47:56.520]  low-voiced you know just saying and here you have this and the public blah blah
[02:47:56.520 --> 02:48:01.400]  blah so I turned my camera off go back to walking and then jogging because I
[02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:06.320]  was jogging and walking and talking to people and doing reports and the woman
[02:48:06.320 --> 02:48:10.760]  goes shut up with your brainwashing she looked like she was about a 45 year old
[02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:15.240]  Hispanic woman and look like she was with her husband it was like a white
[02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:20.400]  guy look like like a government bureaucrat type and I said excuse me she
[02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:23.720]  said you know shut up with your brainwashing and you're and I was like
[02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:27.000]  well what am I brainwashing and she and her husband goes get out of here buddy
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:30.840]  and I went wait a minute I'm just walking by you just said that to me and
[02:48:30.840 --> 02:48:34.400]  later I saw in the video earlier video if they were down looking at me couldn't
[02:48:34.400 --> 02:48:39.680]  even hear me but knew I was he goes get out of here and I went hey your I bet
[02:48:39.680 --> 02:48:43.120]  your wife can't you know back up why I'm a brainwasher man tell me I'm a brain
[02:48:43.120 --> 02:48:47.040]  washer now wasn't even taping I wasn't being confrontational he gets up and he
[02:48:47.040 --> 02:48:53.080]  goes I told you get out of here and I said and I said well actually I was
[02:48:53.080 --> 02:48:57.080]  gonna keep going but now I'm gonna just stand here and I stood and put my hands
[02:48:57.080 --> 02:48:59.560]  on the railing looking over the bridge I'm not gonna let you tell me what to do
[02:48:59.560 --> 02:49:04.400]  but I'm telling you because she was wearing like a Democratic Party hat
[02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:08.840]  that's how I know these were Obama people and I'm telling you conservatives if
[02:49:08.840 --> 02:49:11.840]  they hear you saying something they don't agree with they might say something
[02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:15.720]  but then they're gonna debate you and when I run into these Democrats they
[02:49:15.720 --> 02:49:20.520]  will tell me shut up they think I need to shut up and now you see the
[02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:24.920]  persecution of the press by Obama it shows these are authoritarian creeps
[02:49:24.920 --> 02:49:30.040]  yes I think and now people are starting to begin to see they're starting to
[02:49:30.040 --> 02:49:32.880]  begin to see how bad it is and and that's what that's the fight that I've
[02:49:32.880 --> 02:49:36.960]  had to fight out last couple years in my life just to get people to agree on the
[02:49:36.960 --> 02:49:41.240]  fundamental idea that there shouldn't be the censorship of the press and what's
[02:49:41.240 --> 02:49:46.440]  what shocking to me is before the state wants censorship of the free press they
[02:49:46.440 --> 02:49:50.480]  don't like that we call it cinema verite the full raw video they don't want you
[02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:54.560]  to see the full raw tape because they want they want package stories for you
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:58.120]  and shove those narratives down your throat I I want I just want people to
[02:49:58.120 --> 02:50:01.640]  have all the information I've I trust the American people if they have the
[02:50:01.640 --> 02:50:05.080]  information they can make the best decision for themselves if you walk into
[02:50:05.080 --> 02:50:09.240]  my housing assistance private business and said I want to run underage whores
[02:50:09.240 --> 02:50:14.320]  into America I would say oh wait right here I'd walk in my office and call the
[02:50:14.320 --> 02:50:20.320]  police well I got sued for privacy on that I because I saw me a may corn
[02:50:20.320 --> 02:50:23.040]  employees and some of them sued me for not being allowed to take them the
[02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:27.880]  conversation became not what we exposed but the tactics we use to expose it
[02:50:27.880 --> 02:50:30.240]  that's what they're doing with Edward Snowden they're making the
[02:50:30.240 --> 02:50:34.680]  conversation about him and not what the information is actually exposed this is
[02:50:34.680 --> 02:50:39.800]  the diversion this is the obfuscation that the board the state uses and you
[02:50:39.800 --> 02:50:43.440]  know you need to learn how to how to break through that well people need to
[02:50:43.440 --> 02:50:46.680]  support you you've been through hell but come to the other side and are the
[02:50:46.680 --> 02:50:50.560]  model of perseverance towards Washington for almost eight years fought

[02:56:41.920 --> 02:56:45.640]  realize like when you're sitting in a federal jail cell and you know a judge
[02:56:45.640 --> 02:56:49.400]  destroys your evidence yeah you're scared to death I mean it's the biggest

[03:01:05.120 --> 03:01:09.920]  interviews next week I have to figure out where I understand the project
[03:01:09.920 --> 03:01:14.240]  veritas.org is that the best main site to visit it's easier he's going to
[03:01:14.240 --> 03:01:18.680]  project veritas.com they all direct to the same place project veritas.com you

[03:01:22.600 --> 03:01:26.400]  goes the same place yeah fantastic want to make sure I'm putting the right one
[03:01:26.400 --> 03:01:31.920]  out fantastic breakthrough our guerrilla war to expose fraud and save
[03:01:31.920 --> 03:01:36.880]  democracy in the last three minutes we've gotten this short segment other
[03:01:36.880 --> 03:01:42.760]  points you'd like to add well I think I think you know there's rules there's
[03:01:42.760 --> 03:01:47.000]  lessons in this book break through this 39 veritas rules as I call them
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:52.120]  shortcuts for the would-be entrepreneurial citizen reporter I think you
[03:01:52.120 --> 03:01:56.080]  should use the power video I think it's the most effective medium I think that
[03:01:56.080 --> 03:01:59.560]  the only way we have to reclaim our power from our from our elected representatives
[03:01:59.560 --> 03:02:02.960]  and people say James why don't you call this book Save the Republic and we are
[03:02:02.960 --> 03:02:06.640]  a constitutional republic I acknowledge that but really what this is about is
[03:02:06.640 --> 03:02:11.400]  bringing power back to the people through information through sunlight they
[03:02:11.400 --> 03:02:15.280]  are extraordinary mechanisms built in to prevent us from reclaiming that power
[03:02:15.280 --> 03:02:19.520]  and the only remaining way if I don't think it's even through voting anymore
[03:02:19.520 --> 03:02:23.680]  I think the only remaining way we can reclaim our power as citizens in this
[03:02:23.680 --> 03:02:28.720]  democratic republic is through exposing the fraud when you expose the fraud you
[03:02:28.720 --> 03:02:31.920]  bring the left and the right together you put you breathe there's a false
[03:02:31.920 --> 03:02:36.200]  dichotomy breaks down and people realize just how broken the system is and you
[03:02:36.200 --> 03:02:39.640]  don't take my word for it you can look at the results of our work six states
[03:02:39.640 --> 03:02:42.680]  change their laws people resigned just two weeks ago who released an
[03:02:42.680 --> 03:02:45.600]  investigation into the federally subsidized lifeline program are they
[03:02:45.600 --> 03:02:49.280]  giving up free phones those phones were sold for drugs they fired the workers
[03:02:49.280 --> 03:02:54.120]  that retraining the whole program we get results we get actual results and we
[03:02:54.120 --> 03:03:02.080]  get the federal government to respond to us who who inspired you as a
[03:03:02.080 --> 03:03:07.240]  journalist well we had a lot of a lot of inspirations one of them might shock
[03:03:07.240 --> 03:03:13.800]  you actually I read Saul linsky and you know let me be clear I'm not you know
[03:03:13.800 --> 03:03:18.280]  endorsing everything that's all in he said but I read him and I understood
[03:03:18.280 --> 03:03:23.800]  kind of where they're coming from and I understood what the tactics they use and
[03:03:23.800 --> 03:03:27.760]  how they make their adversaries live up to their own principles they expose
[03:03:27.760 --> 03:03:32.080]  hypocrisy so I was inspired to expose apocrisy in my college campus being
[03:03:32.080 --> 03:03:35.880]  around professors and they're telling me you can't say this you can't say that
[03:03:35.880 --> 03:03:41.280]  it's a it's offensive to say things and it's and they were expelling people and
[03:03:41.280 --> 03:03:45.440]  really there's this authoritarian scumbag bullies right but I but I use
[03:03:45.440 --> 03:03:49.120]  that against them I've created a video I I said I was on a ban lucky charm the
[03:03:49.120 --> 03:03:52.680]  breakfast cereal on the grounds with racist against Irish people so being an
[03:03:52.680 --> 03:03:56.400]  Irish-American and they took it seriously they said they were gonna remove lucky
[03:03:56.400 --> 03:04:01.720]  charm so I threw it right back in their face using their own Orwellian kind of
[03:04:01.720 --> 03:04:06.880]  silencing tactics and it worked yeah that's like saying let's get rid of Santa
[03:04:06.880 --> 03:04:11.320]  Claus it's mean to Dutch people or let's get rid of saying the redskins
[03:04:11.320 --> 03:04:17.800]  that's like honorable warriors you know it's like an honor you know to it's like
[03:04:17.800 --> 03:04:22.920]  the Vikings it's making fun of Norse people it's just ridiculous yeah it's
[03:04:22.920 --> 03:04:27.920]  ridiculous they were forced to choose between being ridiculous or being you
[03:04:27.920 --> 03:04:32.240]  know or or being hypocrites so it's it's really a beautiful thing because we put
[03:04:32.240 --> 03:04:35.960]  people in situations just or like the recent video we did were with the guns

[03:09:42.040 --> 03:09:48.440]  build a civilization that goes to the stars and I know that's gonna happen but
[03:09:48.440 --> 03:09:55.080]  we have to inspire not just ourselves but future generations my heroes have
[03:09:55.080 --> 03:10:02.840]  always lived their lives on the limb all I remember is I want to be like them
[03:10:03.200 --> 03:10:09.200]  you hear me getting all excited having James O'Keefe on that guy goes through

[03:10:15.080 --> 03:10:20.360]  tyranny that's the model I get excited with people like we are changing Luke
[03:10:20.360 --> 03:10:25.480]  Rodowski out there taking action and I'm so honored that I inspired them I can
[03:10:25.480 --> 03:10:31.760]  see all the things that I helped grow and foster and it's not a power trip it's
[03:10:31.760 --> 03:10:36.600]  the fact that it's exciting to know that humanity has a destiny humanity has
[03:10:36.600 --> 03:10:52.400]  power and that you have power song says it all all right ladies and gentlemen I'm
[03:10:52.400 --> 03:10:55.600]  gonna jam in a few phone calls have been holding patiently and then it's some
[03:10:55.600 --> 03:11:01.200]  final news here on the live transmission but if you go to drudgereport.com it's
[03:11:01.200 --> 03:11:05.200]  it's got about the best wide-spectrum coverage of what's happening with the
[03:11:05.200 --> 03:11:12.280]  whole situation there in Florida with the Zimmerman trial Trayvon Martin
[03:11:12.280 --> 03:11:18.880]  debacle and I got to tell you right now I hope this is not the calm before the
[03:11:18.880 --> 03:11:23.520]  storm and I hope people don't riot and then the cops you know tear gas and
[03:11:23.520 --> 03:11:27.880]  rubber bullet people and then a big circus happens and they use it for
[03:11:27.880 --> 03:11:32.840]  another excuse to lock down cities in the US and then have free speech zones
[03:11:32.840 --> 03:11:36.160]  which they're already announcing and and then it turns into I mean I saw the
[03:11:36.160 --> 03:11:40.600]  police chief from from Boston who he knows covering up what really happened
[03:11:40.600 --> 03:11:44.200]  there going we need a unified system for all communications that the public can't
[03:11:44.200 --> 03:11:48.480]  hear I mean just total FEMA mouthpiece propaganda saw on C-span back
[03:11:48.480 --> 03:11:54.600]  there in the coffee room back during the kitchen about an hour ago it's just a
[03:11:54.600 --> 03:11:58.560]  non-stop power grab going on but Zimmerman defense makes final case be
[03:11:58.560 --> 03:12:05.200]  vigilant diligent in deciding this trial live broadcast nets poised to pounce on
[03:12:05.200 --> 03:12:16.800]  verdict show judge has a long life as a Democrat that's that's a bunch of different
[03:12:16.800 --> 03:12:19.480]  talk show hosts are about their limbaugh and Levin are saying that yeah it's true
[03:12:19.480 --> 03:12:24.120]  she's big Democratic operative pressured by Obama administration there's a lot of
[03:12:24.120 --> 03:12:28.400]  evidence to that that's our article in fours.com Levin blasts he's obnoxious and
[03:12:28.400 --> 03:12:32.160]  pathetic she's more than that she's obstructing justice she's tampering with
[03:12:32.160 --> 03:12:39.040]  the jury she's she's done no one's ever seen judges act like this a pastor says
[03:12:39.040 --> 03:12:43.280]  Miami will be ground zero for riots and looting police readying first
[03:12:43.280 --> 03:12:47.960]  amendment zones he'll be the problem in Miami for for looters they've still got
[03:12:47.960 --> 03:12:57.640]  some second amendment in Miami and what is the point of looting your city when
[03:12:57.640 --> 03:13:01.280]  it only destroys the economy you what's the point of burning your
[03:13:01.280 --> 03:13:05.960]  neighborhoods down and you got the new black Panther Party is saying unrest
[03:13:05.960 --> 03:13:12.280]  all over America if Zimmerman goes free I mean look can there be a charge for
[03:13:12.280 --> 03:13:14.760]  Zimmerman doing something stupid following somebody around with a gun I
[03:13:14.760 --> 03:13:21.480]  mean it's pretty clear he did that but it's also clear that Trayvon bum rush
[03:13:21.480 --> 03:13:25.520]  team he led a 12 year old kid he was 17 year old big guy and was pretty much
[03:13:25.520 --> 03:13:29.840]  beaten to death so he had a right to shoot him from the preponderance of
[03:13:29.840 --> 03:13:34.960]  evidence is that there isn't enough evidence to convict Zimmerman you just
[03:13:34.960 --> 03:13:38.640]  don't convict somebody because people think it's too bad this happened I mean
[03:13:38.640 --> 03:13:42.000]  are there gonna be riots that there are hundreds of black people killed every
[03:13:42.000 --> 03:13:45.680]  year in Chicago with blacks killing blacks no no no no it's all cuz it's a
[03:13:45.680 --> 03:13:55.000]  white guy cuz NPR said he was white and I'm sorry Zimmerman doesn't even really
[03:13:55.000 --> 03:14:01.400]  look Hispanic to me he looks like Kim Jong-un so I mean is there gonna be an
[03:14:01.400 --> 03:14:06.120]  attack on me is there a Korean community in Miami or not area of the
[03:14:06.120 --> 03:14:11.480]  surrounding area of Florida and then the larger question yeah here's the
[03:14:11.480 --> 03:14:14.720]  article people people from the street have come up to me last night and I've
[03:14:14.720 --> 03:14:18.160]  got emails going what the Justice Department ran it yeah it's on record
[03:14:18.160 --> 03:14:20.480]  the Justice Department admitted last year let's put the article back up I'll
[03:14:20.480 --> 03:14:24.440]  give them the headline why did the Obama administration organize and manage
[03:14:24.440 --> 03:14:31.840]  protests against George Zimmerman I guess he might look a little Hispanic but
[03:14:31.840 --> 03:14:36.920]  he looks he kind of looks like Filipino which I guess is Spanish background
[03:14:36.920 --> 03:14:41.960]  Asian background I mean I don't know what does it even matter he's a guy who
[03:14:41.960 --> 03:14:46.880]  they had robberies in the area and and and maybe there's a stereotype of a big
[03:14:46.880 --> 03:14:50.040]  black guy with a hoodie over his head walking around between things and you
[03:14:50.040 --> 03:14:53.600]  said I mean I wouldn't see a black guy in a hoodie and think oh my gosh I'm being
[03:14:53.600 --> 03:14:59.320]  robbed but there's that image in MTV and everything that's pushed that you might
[03:14:59.320 --> 03:15:03.080]  think that I guess I'm hip enough to know people wear hoodies all over the
[03:15:03.080 --> 03:15:08.480]  place people in my office white people black people whatever wear hoodies I
[03:15:08.480 --> 03:15:13.200]  like to keep it so cold in the office but so again yes I can get why people
[03:15:13.200 --> 03:15:17.760]  have been inflamed but the inflaming is being used as a political diversion and
[03:15:17.760 --> 03:15:21.600]  whenever the whenever they go to the jury whenever it might be an hour might
[03:15:21.600 --> 03:15:25.920]  be two days I think they're gonna deliberate a while just you know to
[03:15:25.920 --> 03:15:28.720]  try to make it look like they deliberated I think you're gonna get a
[03:15:28.720 --> 03:15:34.160]  not guilty if there's any justice because I mean if there's any question
[03:15:34.160 --> 03:15:38.720]  that somebody didn't do something cold-bloodedly then they should go free
[03:15:38.720 --> 03:15:42.960]  him he'll definitely get on an appeal is there gonna be rioting two years from
[03:15:42.960 --> 03:15:47.840]  now when appeal gets heard and everything this is such a diversion I
[03:15:47.840 --> 03:15:52.320]  mean where is the new black Panther Party talking about 40,000 people most
[03:15:52.320 --> 03:15:55.360]  of them black killed by all the counterforces in Libya the last three
[03:15:55.360 --> 03:15:59.440]  years hacked up with the Shaddys and through this they don't care it's just
[03:15:59.440 --> 03:16:06.240]  political garbage to create division and the new black Panther Party I've been
[03:16:06.240 --> 03:16:09.960]  to meetings and events that they've been at I mean really come off like just the
[03:16:09.960 --> 03:16:18.920]  dumbest stupidest FBI handled provocateur flaming racist that because
[03:16:18.920 --> 03:16:22.200]  I've gone and protested the Ku Klux Klan some of these clips are online the full
[03:16:22.200 --> 03:16:25.840]  clips my cancer can't find them I'm protesting him here in Austin and also
[03:16:25.840 --> 03:16:29.040]  about and wake up they threaten to kill me and stuff on the dais and then the
[03:16:29.040 --> 03:16:36.400]  police would do nothing about it but it's the same it's like it's even more
[03:16:36.400 --> 03:16:40.840]  crazed than what I've seen with the Klan and we're showing some LA riot stuff
[03:16:40.840 --> 03:16:45.520]  here and we found a Reginald Denny having his head beat in just some white
[03:16:45.520 --> 03:16:50.480]  guy driving a truck turned out he was a big liberal and you know just I mean if
[03:16:50.480 --> 03:16:54.800]  I live in LA and I was a black racist rioter would I be smart enough to know
[03:16:54.800 --> 03:17:01.360]  most people that live in Los Angeles or total liberals and who absolutely buy
[03:17:01.360 --> 03:17:04.840]  into the whole system I mean why would you just here here's a white guy let's
[03:17:04.840 --> 03:17:09.840]  beat his head in with bricks by the way if I was a truck driver and people did
[03:17:09.840 --> 03:17:13.240]  that it'd be like oh you're not my witness are gonna assault me here say
[03:17:13.240 --> 03:17:16.880]  hello to my little friend I don't care what color you are you're trying to
[03:17:16.880 --> 03:17:19.880]  kill me with a rock you're gonna get shot that's what the second it's all
[03:17:19.880 --> 03:17:23.360]  about see the globalists don't want us to have guns bill protect ourselves they
[03:17:23.360 --> 03:17:28.480]  want martial law in place let's go to Jim but a great political diversion from
[03:17:28.480 --> 03:17:33.400]  the NSA the IRS scandal all of it what a great diversion from Benghazi the
[03:17:33.400 --> 03:17:36.240]  Justice Department is trying to stir up here with that judge tampering with the
[03:17:36.240 --> 03:17:40.840]  jury I think he'll be found not guilty eat I think they'll buck the judge but
[03:17:40.840 --> 03:17:45.680]  it isn't I think you're gonna have some unrest I don't think it's gonna be huge
[03:17:45.680 --> 03:17:51.960]  I hope it isn't let's talk to Jim in Florida Jim you're on the air hello
[03:17:51.960 --> 03:17:57.720]  Alex you may be crazy but I wonder if you're crazy enough to to urge all your
[03:17:57.720 --> 03:18:06.040]  listeners to go to the NSA site and the FBI site download the Freedom of
[03:18:06.040 --> 03:18:13.300]  Information Act form fill it out and mail it snail mail with a return receipt
[03:18:13.300 --> 03:18:19.400]  requested to those respective organizations yeah I've sent certified
[03:18:19.400 --> 03:18:23.040]  letters before and never even got a response under law they're supposed to
[03:18:23.040 --> 03:18:27.400]  in fact I've told the crew I want to hire one of those lawyers that does it and
[03:18:27.400 --> 03:18:31.360]  I want my files from these scum and then I'm gonna sue them when they don't give
[03:18:31.360 --> 03:18:35.520]  them to me because I want to read all the made-up stuff and informants and
[03:18:35.520 --> 03:18:42.360]  spies and all the rest of it that's a good idea everybody should do for your
[03:18:42.360 --> 03:18:47.240]  request on have they been spied on their name that's a good idea yeah their name
[03:18:47.240 --> 03:18:52.960]  and and from what I understand the way you do it is as you give them your
[03:18:52.960 --> 03:18:58.080]  social security number and your driver's license so whatever they have under those
[03:18:58.080 --> 03:19:03.040]  particular files they're supposed to give you and if they don't and if we get
[03:19:03.040 --> 03:19:10.920]  enough enough people who are declined I would think we could do we could file
[03:19:10.920 --> 03:19:14.920]  class action suits well we need to have class action suits over four years they
[03:19:14.920 --> 03:19:18.640]  said we're gonna have a secret CIA and make the government secret but don't
[03:19:18.640 --> 03:19:22.000]  worry there won't be any problems because you'll be able to do an open records
[03:19:22.000 --> 03:19:25.080]  request and we have to give it to you must especially class and now they're
[03:19:25.080 --> 03:19:28.360]  classifying all their crimes and they're ignoring four years all the time
[03:19:28.360 --> 03:19:32.760]  because they're an out-of-control group of Craven scum at the top most the
[03:19:32.760 --> 03:19:36.120]  mid-level people aren't that bad but they're still told to go out and do
[03:19:36.120 --> 03:19:43.480]  things that I know they statutorily can't do absolutely they do it all the
[03:19:43.480 --> 03:19:48.360]  time but but the other thing too is by sending if we could get enough people to
[03:19:48.360 --> 03:19:52.040]  do this and I'm gonna be doing it because I've had a I've had an open file since
[03:19:52.040 --> 03:19:56.360]  the 60s when I was with the special forces and and we're not all like the
[03:19:56.360 --> 03:20:01.680]  like the ones that you talk about Alex oh listen I'll be honest with you I have
[03:20:01.680 --> 03:20:05.240]  found the special forces in military period I don't just say that to be the
[03:20:05.240 --> 03:20:10.440]  most awake best people that are out there that's when I found because they're
[03:20:10.440 --> 03:20:14.040]  in it they see it they know it's not bullets like Staff Sergeant Biggs he
[03:20:14.040 --> 03:20:17.640]  said I was in it I saw all the fraud you know as a ranger I've been like six
[03:20:17.640 --> 03:20:23.360]  years out of combat everywhere you know in armored vehicles blown up by IEDs I
[03:20:23.360 --> 03:20:28.280]  find the military and even police on average are more awake than the general
[03:20:28.280 --> 03:20:32.360]  public but there's so many bad ones as well and they're trying to get the bad
[03:20:32.360 --> 03:20:37.280]  guys and promote them and trying to persecute people that won't do things
[03:20:37.280 --> 03:20:43.040]  that are illegal I had a state agency come here before they set a routine
[03:20:43.040 --> 03:20:48.080]  audit and I looked at the law and stuff all I could have even fought showing
[03:20:48.080 --> 03:20:52.200]  them the employee roles just to make sure unemployment insurance you know was
[03:20:52.200 --> 03:20:57.840]  being properly paid or whatever and and we use a major payroll firm anyway so
[03:20:57.840 --> 03:21:01.160]  it's all handled and in the three years ago they wanted an audit it was just to
[03:21:01.160 --> 03:21:05.400]  see those those records well now the guy wanted to come here turned out he was a
[03:21:05.400 --> 03:21:09.320]  listener and who I was and said I promise you're not being singled out this
[03:21:09.320 --> 03:21:14.800]  is random and I'm like that finally I had to get some stuff done before my
[03:21:14.800 --> 03:21:18.200]  accountant left and so it was supposed to go an hour like two hours later the
[03:21:18.200 --> 03:21:22.000]  guy's still there he says he's listening and so I go in there and I was like okay
[03:21:22.000 --> 03:21:24.680]  well she's got to leave in like 30 minutes he said oh actually I've
[03:21:24.680 --> 03:21:27.440]  actually got everything I need now but when he first got there he had this
[03:21:27.440 --> 03:21:31.960]  sheet saying we want your corporate minutes we want your blah blah blah and
[03:21:31.960 --> 03:21:34.680]  I statutorily had already checked it before I knew they were coming they
[03:21:34.680 --> 03:21:38.400]  can't ask for all that but he said well this is what my supervisor says I do
[03:21:38.400 --> 03:21:42.000]  now well I mean your supervisor next will probably ask to you know if they
[03:21:42.000 --> 03:21:45.680]  can do a proctology exam on my wife on the side of the highway I mean that's
[03:21:45.680 --> 03:21:49.080]  what the state police I mean can I walk the cop and say you know I want to stick
[03:21:49.080 --> 03:21:53.200]  my hand in your pants in and into your body just to make sure there's not
[03:21:53.200 --> 03:21:57.080]  marijuana in there the cop would would freak out on me and probably should well
[03:21:57.080 --> 03:21:59.880]  how do they pull you over go you know what I'm gonna search the car without a
[03:21:59.880 --> 03:22:02.800]  warrant and I'm gonna stick my hand in your body and I'm gonna go over here
[03:22:02.800 --> 03:22:06.520]  to another woman and use the same dirty glove I mean if I'd have been told that
[03:22:06.520 --> 03:22:11.960]  10 years ago that that could happen in Texas I would have said no way no way
[03:22:11.960 --> 03:22:16.040]  and it just shows how I mean they came here with a census and said we're gonna
[03:22:16.040 --> 03:22:19.240]  come after you if you don't fill out this business census it's now yearly
[03:22:19.240 --> 03:22:23.760]  would just would cost me $50,000 to answer those questions properly with
[03:22:23.760 --> 03:22:27.040]  accountants and people under penalty of perjury I don't have the time for all
[03:22:27.040 --> 03:22:31.800]  this stuff and I said no fifth amendment send it back so I think that's
[03:22:31.800 --> 03:22:37.680]  probably what's going on too and just Ted Anderson in Minnesota literally had
[03:22:37.680 --> 03:22:40.960]  to move his offices because the bureaucrats were harassing him they said
[03:22:40.960 --> 03:22:45.640]  you can move in here it's zoned for it four years later made a move he lost you
[03:22:45.640 --> 03:22:49.080]  know like a half million bucks and these bureaucrats has come in his office and
[03:22:49.080 --> 03:22:53.120]  just literally kicked their feet up on the desk and just boss everybody around
[03:22:53.120 --> 03:22:57.040]  get me coffee and they're there they live there the different agencies but
[03:22:57.040 --> 03:23:01.960]  it's not just him up in Minnesota it's every business and again they not the
[03:23:01.960 --> 03:23:05.800]  average rank and file they don't get it but I'm telling you even in Texas now
[03:23:05.800 --> 03:23:10.680]  they want to shut down small operations big big global groups know all the rules
[03:23:10.680 --> 03:23:14.840]  all the regs you walk in they go here's the card of our corporate staff they do
[03:23:14.840 --> 03:23:17.880]  something wrong grievances are found they don't go in the big buildings they
[03:23:17.880 --> 03:23:22.300]  don't go over to Google they don't go over to Dincorps downtown probably
[03:23:22.300 --> 03:23:26.680]  trafficking kids through there they do it internationally no no no no they don't
[03:23:26.680 --> 03:23:31.000]  go to the Federal Reserve laundering drug money they come to your office and
[03:23:31.000 --> 03:23:35.720]  the mission is shut America down I know I'm ranting serve anything else you'd
[03:23:35.720 --> 03:23:41.720]  like to add well one thing I'd like to add that this off the national security
[03:23:41.720 --> 03:23:50.240]  agency subject is is a big sis was was a classic Peter principal lateral shift
[03:23:50.240 --> 03:23:55.120]  because she was creating too much trouble so basically all she's done is
[03:23:55.120 --> 03:24:01.200]  changed her hat from Heinrich Mueller to to Joseph Mengele and Werner
[03:24:01.200 --> 03:24:08.960]  Heisenberg because the University of California has huge nuclear research
[03:24:08.960 --> 03:24:13.880]  labs as well as huge medical research oh yeah no that's wrong with her and
[03:24:13.880 --> 03:24:17.480]  yeah with her in charge you can imagine what kind of research are going to be
[03:24:17.480 --> 03:24:21.400]  doing oh yeah there's tens of billions of federal and state money going to those
[03:24:21.400 --> 03:24:24.480]  research facilities in California you're right about that you know your stuff
[03:24:24.480 --> 03:24:28.440]  oh yeah they're gonna be sucking it dry giving it to insiders she's there to
[03:24:28.440 --> 03:24:32.320]  run a criminal operation you can guarantee that and they're smart to get
[03:24:32.320 --> 03:24:39.480]  rid of her because she did become a nice eyesore and so it's actually a good
[03:24:39.480 --> 03:24:43.560]  move by them I thought they were really getting arrogant and was enjoying it so
[03:24:43.560 --> 03:24:46.760]  I'm gonna miss her but but don't worry we're gonna continue to follow her did
[03:24:46.760 --> 03:24:50.160]  you hear my joke or Wayne Madsen joke about are they gonna muzzle her around
[03:24:50.160 --> 03:24:54.960]  the students yeah that was hilarious from what I've heard I think they
[03:24:54.960 --> 03:24:59.440]  actually have to all right thank you very much God bless you what up what a
[03:24:59.440 --> 03:25:03.840]  pig like creature that's a big genitus and and people say man you're really
[03:25:03.840 --> 03:25:08.360]  messing with I just don't care anymore I mean I defile them they are
[03:25:08.360 --> 03:25:12.120]  disgusting maggots and I don't mean because of her sexual preferences I
[03:25:12.120 --> 03:25:17.960]  mean the the bullying the thuggish lying the walmarts with announcements that
[03:25:17.960 --> 03:25:23.720]  look for terrorists that's beyond 1984 and they put those only in a few hundred
[03:25:23.720 --> 03:25:28.360]  of the 800 plus walmarts because people backlashed about going watch everyone
[03:25:28.360 --> 03:25:34.360]  hi I'm big sister that's real video from a Walmart in Minnesota speaking of the
[03:25:34.360 --> 03:25:37.160]  devil Minnesota is probably one of the prettiest states I've been to but let me
[03:25:37.160 --> 03:25:40.560]  tell you the people are smart they're friendly they're nice but they are
[03:25:40.560 --> 03:25:48.960]  submissive and I mean just what is there nothing Minnesota won't put up with hi

[03:26:02.440 --> 03:26:06.960]  Homeland Security I'm injecting Diana ball and security begins with hometown

[03:26:27.280 --> 03:26:32.360]  hello earthlings we are here to take care of you trust no one but us your
[03:26:32.360 --> 03:26:37.160]  neighbors are all terrorists George Washington is a pig I am your mommy
[03:26:37.160 --> 03:26:44.320]  William in New York you're on the air I'm sorry go ahead sir I just want to
[03:26:44.320 --> 03:26:49.240]  get bring up something about a Trevon Martin I had a little Instagram debate
[03:26:49.240 --> 03:26:54.600]  from earlier today and I just I don't understand you know they're talking about
[03:26:54.600 --> 03:26:59.720]  all these riots and stuff like that but when Casey Anthony was acquitted
[03:26:59.720 --> 03:27:04.920]  nobody's mentioned anything about riot when O.J. Simpson was acquitted people
[03:27:04.920 --> 03:27:09.120]  actually stood in the streets and cheered and there's videos on YouTube with
[03:27:09.120 --> 03:27:14.400]  that and I just I don't understand you know what the you know the black dancers
[03:27:14.400 --> 03:27:19.040]  coming on saying that they're gonna be in rest alone with the United States people
[03:27:19.040 --> 03:27:25.520]  don't need to you know look at at color you know African-Americans you know they
[03:27:25.520 --> 03:27:31.880]  like to pull the race card every race does that no matter what no no listen
[03:27:31.880 --> 03:27:36.440]  listen I got a lot of crew I'm around a lot of people everybody uses political
[03:27:36.440 --> 03:27:40.560]  correctness now at some level I'm just completely sick of it I want to be shown
[03:27:40.560 --> 03:27:43.360]  what people do what they will who they are
[03:27:43.360 --> 03:27:48.720]  instead of what color their skin is Martin Luther King said it's not the
[03:27:48.720 --> 03:27:52.520]  content it's the it's the contact of someone's character not their skin
[03:27:52.520 --> 03:27:56.360]  color and we all you need to stand tonight it if Zimmerman's wrong he's
[03:27:56.360 --> 03:28:00.640]  wrong I personally don't feel that way but I'm sure there's gonna be people
[03:28:00.640 --> 03:28:05.080]  that you know will have their opinions but if he's wrong he's wrong if he's
[03:28:05.080 --> 03:28:10.360]  right he's right people need to stand together as one color not most sure
[03:28:10.360 --> 03:28:13.040]  well here's the but here's what here's also people don't get about juris
[03:28:13.040 --> 03:28:17.160]  prudence and Magna Carta and our system of common law and the Bill of Rights and
[03:28:17.160 --> 03:28:22.960]  law you've got to have the preponderance of evidence he's guilty that's a high
[03:28:22.960 --> 03:28:27.880]  standard if there's any doubt you got to let him off I think what he did was
[03:28:27.880 --> 03:28:31.800]  wasn't that smart but because there's all these witnesses that Trayvon was
[03:28:31.800 --> 03:28:34.640]  beating him up and putting his head in the ground which the evidence shows
[03:28:34.640 --> 03:28:40.600]  you've got to acquit now you know can they dig up something of a weapons deal
[03:28:40.600 --> 03:28:43.680]  that he was off his property with a gun and I mean there's you know their
[03:28:43.680 --> 03:28:47.480]  citizens arrest stuff I think it was stupid but I don't think you can send
[03:28:47.480 --> 03:28:51.160]  him to prison for it and then people got to understand that that's the way it is
[03:28:51.160 --> 03:28:55.120]  I mean if there was no witnesses that Trayvon was beating him up he would get
[03:28:55.120 --> 03:29:00.600]  he would get a murder charge probably even premeditated that might be murder
[03:29:00.600 --> 03:29:04.560]  one you know I'm a he's a racist he's gonna go out and kill a black guy I mean
[03:29:04.560 --> 03:29:07.440]  I don't think that's what he is turns out when his best friends is black he's
[03:29:07.440 --> 03:29:12.520]  all the spanish families and it goes by Jorge I mean you know I mean are there
[03:29:12.520 --> 03:29:16.040]  Hispanics that don't like black people yeah I guess but I mean it's I mean I
[03:29:16.040 --> 03:29:19.240]  gotta be honest I'm a white guy okay I grew up in the so-called South Texas I
[03:29:19.240 --> 03:29:27.200]  never heard about all this stuff I just did not experience it I've traveled in
[03:29:27.200 --> 03:29:29.720]  the north and actually heard more race stuff but I think it's more of a joke
[03:29:29.720 --> 03:29:33.360]  like everybody does it to each other and I think that's the answer to this is
[03:29:33.360 --> 03:29:37.360]  just make it all a big joke get over it and just start getting back to being
[03:29:37.360 --> 03:29:42.800]  people but they will use a any type of disturbances to take more of our
[03:29:42.800 --> 03:29:46.920]  liberties and play the public off against the cops as well it's more divide
[03:29:46.920 --> 03:29:50.200]  and conquer info works not only news tonight 7 and I will be live on the
