[00:00.000 --> 00:11.920]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:11.920 --> 00:19.440]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:19.440 --> 00:40.280]  Alex Jones
[00:40.280 --> 00:47.280]  it is Monday the 22nd day of August 2011 we're gonna be live here for the
[00:47.280 --> 00:51.120]  next three hours I am your host Alex Jones joining us coming up in an hour
[00:51.120 --> 00:56.400]  and a half from now Gerald Solente the trends research forecaster will be
[00:56.400 --> 01:02.480]  joining us to talk about the economy and other major world events in Libya and
[01:02.480 --> 01:07.440]  other nations across the planet including Syria next target on the
[01:07.440 --> 01:12.120]  globalist hit list Webster Griffin Tarpley who's been to Libya many times
[01:12.120 --> 01:17.200]  over the years and spent several weeks there a few months ago will be joining
[01:17.200 --> 01:24.280]  us of course the conflict that lasted six months total four and a half months of
[01:24.280 --> 01:31.080]  ongoing public NATO involvement is far from over now the al-Qaeda forces that
[01:31.080 --> 01:35.360]  have taken over much of Tripoli and most the other major cities will now engage
[01:35.360 --> 01:41.400]  in a reign of bloody slaughter terror and mass murder show trials you name it and
[01:41.400 --> 01:48.360]  of course much of the gold and much of the frozen Libyan bank accounts will be
[01:48.360 --> 01:53.280]  given to al-Qaeda as a new command base and I predict within the next few years
[01:53.280 --> 01:57.240]  they'll have to be another invasion and the media won't even point out that the
[01:57.240 --> 02:01.720]  West put these guys in and they'll say oh my gosh al-Qaeda hit us and hit as hard
[02:01.720 --> 02:08.760]  we've got to invade Libya again because of that dirty al-CIA to so we're going
[02:08.760 --> 02:13.600]  to be going over those reports coming up after the first break NATO hands
[02:13.600 --> 02:19.240]  terrorist who killed US troops control of Libya Paul Joseph Watson has a detailed
[02:19.240 --> 02:26.360]  report at info wars.com and prison planet.com live from Western Tripoli
[02:26.360 --> 02:32.160]  Western media complicit in NATO's humanitarian bloodbath that's what
[02:32.160 --> 02:35.160]  reporters for global research are saying on the ground and they admit
[02:35.160 --> 02:40.560]  thousands of dead but again it's not a war it is a peace action by the Nobel
[02:40.560 --> 02:48.720]  Peace Laureate a supreme leader dear gracious leader Obama continuing with
[02:48.720 --> 02:56.640]  these reports after the break 1,300 dead in attack on Tripoli government
[02:56.640 --> 03:02.280]  spokesman it's French news agency also the battle for Libya is almost over as
[03:02.280 --> 03:07.960]  is the battle for its 144 tons of gold that's why Chavez is getting his gold
[03:07.960 --> 03:11.160]  out of England and other places you know they're about to put sanctions on
[03:11.160 --> 03:16.600]  them and seize those goodies also NATO loots Libyan gold as Tripoli falls
[03:16.600 --> 03:24.360]  that's just some of the reports we have there and now the eastern backed al-Qaeda
[03:24.360 --> 03:30.200]  groups are going to have quite an orgy of bloodletting excuse me
[03:30.200 --> 03:36.600]  humanitarian assistance inside Libya and the country of course will be gutted
[03:36.600 --> 03:41.880]  end-to-end completely deindustrialized and the once prosperous nation when the
[03:41.880 --> 03:48.200]  next few years you'll see starvation lines and people begging UNICEF for food
[03:48.200 --> 03:55.160]  they'll be given the food as long as they take the special injections of course
[03:55.160 --> 03:58.560]  Gaddafi I remember five years ago caught the UN adding sterilization
[03:58.560 --> 04:02.400]  hormones to vaccines something they've been caught in India and other parts of
[04:02.400 --> 04:06.480]  Africa in the past doing and that's another reason the Gaddafi is being
[04:06.480 --> 04:13.160]  taken out I'm not a fan of the dictator but in the final equation he's being
[04:13.160 --> 04:18.720]  taken out to put something even worse in and he was trying to get Africa with
[04:18.720 --> 04:24.000]  its own currency he was trying to industrialize Africa and at the same
[04:24.000 --> 04:29.920]  time Gaddafi of course was sitting on top of all of that gold that the
[04:29.920 --> 04:33.960]  establishment wanted and Gaddafi was foolish enough seven years ago to make
[04:33.960 --> 04:38.320]  a deal with the West and start investing the country's money with Goldman Sachs
[04:38.320 --> 04:44.760]  JP Morgan and others and once he started democratizing the country that allowed
[04:44.760 --> 04:49.440]  Western intelligence agencies to come in and fully scope things out so their
[04:49.440 --> 04:54.440]  legendary attack dog Al-Qaeda who took down the Serbs and took down the
[04:54.440 --> 05:02.000]  Russians could be loosed we'll be right back Al-Qaeda's another great job hundreds
[05:02.000 --> 05:06.360]  of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last
[05:06.360 --> 05:11.400]  chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're
[05:11.400 --> 05:15.000]  pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home I've termed it as
[05:15.000 --> 05:19.400]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[05:19.400 --> 05:24.560]  sharks I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[05:24.560 --> 05:29.080]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[05:29.080 --> 05:33.760]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[05:33.760 --> 05:37.800]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[05:37.800 --> 05:41.480]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[05:41.480 --> 05:46.560]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen

[07:03.960 --> 07:08.120]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[07:08.120 --> 07:12.440]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[07:12.440 --> 07:16.400]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[07:16.400 --> 07:20.760]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[07:20.760 --> 07:25.080]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[07:25.080 --> 07:28.840]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[07:28.840 --> 07:32.960]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[07:32.960 --> 07:36.960]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[07:36.960 --> 07:40.720]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[07:40.720 --> 07:43.440]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[07:43.440 --> 07:48.720]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolar
[07:48.720 --> 07:53.200]  backup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the

[08:00.200 --> 08:08.200]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:13.800 --> 08:22.840]  it is Monday the 22nd day of August 2011 Gerald Salente is coming up at the
[08:22.840 --> 08:27.520]  bottom of the next hour to break down the current developments in the economy
[08:27.520 --> 08:31.840]  and his future predictions on where it is going we'll also get his take on other
[08:31.840 --> 08:36.360]  geopolitical trends like the situation in Libya in the last 30 minutes of the
[08:36.360 --> 08:40.840]  broadcast today Webster Griffin Tarpley historian and of course economist who
[08:40.840 --> 08:46.200]  traveled and spent several weeks a month or so ago in Libya will be joining us to
[08:46.200 --> 08:52.640]  break down the latest developments there also coming up later I covered some of
[08:52.640 --> 08:55.960]  this yesterday on the Sunday broadcast want to get more into it Ron Paul
[08:55.960 --> 09:00.200]  they're setting the stage for violence in this country that's what he said when
[09:00.200 --> 09:04.840]  he was asked by a reporter you concerned about the National Emergencies Center's
[09:04.840 --> 09:10.000]  establishment act that sets up FEMA camps or basically just openly legalizes
[09:10.000 --> 09:13.920]  them and funds them to a greater extent they're admittedly there in place
[09:13.920 --> 09:17.920]  working the Houston Chronicle and other publications and Ron Paul said yeah
[09:17.920 --> 09:21.360]  that's their goal they're setting up the stage for violence in this country no
[09:21.360 --> 09:27.320]  doubt about it responded Ron Paul so we're going to be going over some of
[09:27.320 --> 09:33.120]  that today also the economic news let me hit that first social security
[09:33.120 --> 09:39.240]  disability on the verge of insolvency associated press is reporting do you
[09:39.240 --> 09:44.440]  have any idea how many people are on social security disability how many
[09:44.440 --> 09:48.360]  families are already basically moving in together but trying to survive and can
[09:48.360 --> 09:53.200]  even pay for gas money this is the working poor how many people with that
[09:53.200 --> 09:57.800]  are on the verge of eating dog food or already are because there hasn't been a
[09:57.800 --> 10:02.240]  cost of living cola increase in social security in two years they're talking
[10:02.240 --> 10:06.560]  about doing it for a third and fourth year you have any idea what dollar
[10:06.560 --> 10:11.080]  devaluation means to this country a number of delinquent mortgages is on the
[10:11.080 --> 10:17.320]  rise again that's out of CNBC gold advances to record as platinum climbs
[10:17.320 --> 10:25.120]  gold came just shy of 1900 dollars an ounce earlier in the day we're going to
[10:25.120 --> 10:31.120]  continue to track that Wall Street aristocracy got 1.2 trillion in secret
[10:31.120 --> 10:36.240]  fed loans at 0% or less and then of course loaned it back to the public at
[10:36.240 --> 10:41.120]  exorbitant prices or just sat on it being paid by the government interest for
[10:41.120 --> 10:46.720]  holding it you can't make that up continuing stocks jump over 1% all
[10:46.720 --> 10:52.840]  S&P sectors higher that was earlier in the day before it began dropping again
[10:52.840 --> 10:57.920]  in Baltimore homes are selling for ten thousand dollars and less Baltimore
[10:57.920 --> 11:03.720]  son is reporting the Greeks of course gave into the banksters and signed their
[11:03.720 --> 11:07.440]  country's resources over to them so now they're being brought into the next level
[11:07.440 --> 11:15.840]  of debt as the four largest banks agreed to take up a 50 million euro convertible
[11:15.840 --> 11:22.760]  bond to help recapitalize proton bank a smaller lender so that slide is
[11:22.760 --> 11:30.080]  continuing a newly reality for many baby boomers will be to work as wage slaves
[11:30.080 --> 11:33.960]  until they drop dead they're going to push retirement past the average age of
[11:33.960 --> 11:40.880]  death 76 continuing on Wall Street again is in the news calling for even more
[11:40.880 --> 11:51.560]  banker bailouts and QE3 which will only accelerate the demise of the dollar again
[11:51.560 --> 11:56.480]  there's more expectation of continued private Federal Reserve quote stimulus
[11:56.480 --> 12:03.240]  they're only stimulating their own sectors of the economy that is all
[12:03.240 --> 12:09.520]  coming up as well and I want to open the phones up on any issue any news item
[12:09.520 --> 12:15.480]  anything you'd like to talk about the toll free number to join us is 800 259
[12:15.480 --> 12:22.520]  92 31 1 800 259 92 31 now you can call in them with any subject you want to
[12:22.520 --> 12:26.160]  raise but I'm going to try to move on to the next caller quickly I've done a
[12:26.160 --> 12:30.200]  little bit better job as of late but still I wouldn't even call it passable
[12:30.200 --> 12:36.520]  the number of calls we go to and I enjoy your calls I like your calls I like the
[12:36.520 --> 12:41.200]  different directions you take us in and so I will attempt to take more calls in
[12:41.200 --> 12:49.440]  the future including today 800 259 931 I would ask listeners though just
[12:49.440 --> 12:53.200]  specifically at least comment on some of the big topics we're raising here the
[12:53.200 --> 12:58.440]  fact that we're in a depression the fact that Europe is being taken over now by
[12:58.440 --> 13:02.280]  a private banking consortium as part of the establishment of a bank of the
[13:02.280 --> 13:09.360]  world that all of this has been engineered and that after six months of
[13:09.360 --> 13:15.800]  Western backed Al Qaeda driven the core is Al Qaeda back the majority are
[13:15.800 --> 13:21.520]  admitted Al Qaeda that they have now reportedly taken over most of the city
[13:21.520 --> 13:27.400]  of Tripoli and there's ongoing fighting happening right now Gaddafi's disappeared
[13:27.400 --> 13:32.040]  his sons are reportedly been captured but we've heard that before but there's
[13:32.040 --> 13:37.720]  no doubt there are uprisings in Tripoli and that Gaddafi is on his way out now
[13:37.720 --> 13:41.920]  we've heard five or six times that he'd gone to Venezuela or Tunisia or that he
[13:41.920 --> 13:47.400]  had fallen or that the rebels had taken Tripoli but it appears this time it may
[13:47.400 --> 13:52.120]  actually be true we saw Obama say that we'd be there days not weeks that was
[13:52.120 --> 13:57.080]  four and a half months ago and so I was very reticent in the last two days as
[13:57.080 --> 14:02.680]  they announced that the rebels were at the gates but it appears that at least
[14:02.680 --> 14:08.000]  a part of this is true now it'd be one thing if they went in and had elections
[14:08.000 --> 14:14.240]  and the and the people of Libya were allowed to move forward into the future
[14:14.240 --> 14:22.280]  the problem is they had a British backed monarchy dictatorship there before
[14:22.280 --> 14:29.240]  Gaddafi staged his coup 40 years ago and that regime brutally kept the tribes
[14:29.240 --> 14:31.760]  from killing each other the different I don't know there's more than five
[14:31.760 --> 14:37.000]  different tribes in them in the region three of the tribes were loyal to
[14:37.000 --> 14:44.760]  Gaddafi the other two groups out of eastern Libya or more Saudi Arabian and
[14:44.760 --> 14:53.240]  what Yemen backed and now they have been going into every town and city they've
[14:53.240 --> 14:57.640]  taken and just murdering people in mass hanging people from lamp poles
[14:57.640 --> 15:06.840]  anybody they see that's black that that's associated with with people not of
[15:06.840 --> 15:13.080]  Arab descent and so it goes back to that old ancient bigotry of some of the
[15:13.080 --> 15:17.000]  Arabs in the region in the black slave trade and so they're just being killed
[15:17.000 --> 15:22.320]  on the spot and there's no doubt this has been a humanitarian mega disaster and
[15:22.320 --> 15:27.520]  that the globalists want chaos and carnage they'll get control the oil
[15:27.520 --> 15:31.320]  fields and guard them they'll get control of the refineries and guard them and
[15:31.320 --> 15:38.240]  it will shut off the supply to a great extent both to the Libyans and to Europe
[15:38.240 --> 15:41.840]  and you think well wait Europe wants to go in NATO wants to go in to get that oil
[15:41.840 --> 15:46.280]  no no no no there's too much oil that's why our own government won't let us have
[15:46.280 --> 15:49.800]  90 plus percent of the oil out of Alaska even though they've got the fields
[15:49.800 --> 15:56.120]  developed since the 1980s it's about artificial scarcity in the globalist
[15:56.120 --> 16:02.000]  monopoly game they artificially make light bulbs where they break in a few
[16:02.000 --> 16:06.880]  months when they could last 50 years they artificially went in and bought up
[16:06.880 --> 16:13.720]  most of the smaller refineries in the US in the 90s to create a bottleneck so
[16:13.720 --> 16:19.840]  that even if you could deliver oil you can't get it refined AP sued in 2000 and
[16:19.840 --> 16:26.560]  got the documents of the big oil companies meeting in secret in 1996 to buy
[16:26.560 --> 16:30.560]  up which they did did do the refineries in the US that they don't own and to
[16:30.560 --> 16:36.120]  shut them down then they say oh it's the environmentalists they're keeping us from
[16:36.120 --> 16:41.840]  being able to open new refineries pure bull oh they'll have some hippies stand
[16:41.840 --> 16:45.920]  out front of refinery and call for it to be shut down and then the hippies
[16:45.920 --> 16:52.960]  wonder why it's been shut down think they have all this power it's really
[16:52.960 --> 16:57.840]  funny actually and boy people think the hippies are keeping the people that run
[16:57.840 --> 17:02.360]  our country from opening up all those oil fields the folks that have hijacked
[17:02.360 --> 17:06.800]  our nation invade countries and kill over a million people to shut off the
[17:06.800 --> 17:14.440]  oil aka Iraq production way down since the liberation eight years ago this is
[17:14.440 --> 17:21.200]  what it's all about ladies and gentlemen this is what it's all about they
[17:21.200 --> 17:25.400]  could create a half million jobs the studies show in just a few months if
[17:25.400 --> 17:29.240]  they opened up drilling in Alaska and opened it up in many other areas on
[17:29.240 --> 17:34.040]  public lands but they're not going to do it if they do it'll be to a limited
[17:34.040 --> 17:41.080]  token extent and so now the true mass murder deindustrialization of Libya can
[17:41.080 --> 17:46.040]  start there will be ongoing bombings and civil wars and tit for tat tribal
[17:46.040 --> 17:52.600]  killings basically forever now and I predict that the West in the next two
[17:52.600 --> 17:56.880]  to five years will have to invade and notice they're now announcing oh the
[17:56.880 --> 18:00.880]  US forces will now come in to help NATO forces will now come in to help the
[18:00.880 --> 18:05.400]  air cover is going to continue of course it's going to continue the rebels as they

[23:52.600 --> 24:00.240]  to understand the system call 800 686 2237 that's 800 686 2237
[24:22.600 --> 24:29.760]  it was staggering for me when 9-11 took place to watch the media tell us how
[24:29.760 --> 24:35.240]  Al Qaeda was this enemy and that the government had no idea that they had a
[24:35.240 --> 24:40.720]  plan to attack us I knew they'd been used and created to attack the Russians
[24:40.720 --> 24:48.440]  in Afghanistan I knew that they had been used to attack the Serbs in Kosovo and
[24:48.440 --> 24:54.320]  when the Serbs resisted that attack that NATO had bombed Belgrade into the
[24:54.320 --> 24:58.080]  Stone Age bombing their power plants their water treatment their television
[24:58.080 --> 25:04.040]  stations with depleted uranium weapons now a decade later their birth defects
[25:04.040 --> 25:08.880]  have more than tripled in those cities that were bombed these are ruthless
[25:08.880 --> 25:14.960]  globalist and to see the rebel commander brag to the Washington Post and
[25:14.960 --> 25:21.160]  others that yes I've killed Americans in Iraq and now I only quote hate the
[25:21.160 --> 25:28.280]  Americans 50% that's right the groups out of Saudi Arabia and other areas that
[25:28.280 --> 25:35.840]  are in Libya under NATO and US command on record are real Al Qaeda real fighters
[25:35.840 --> 25:41.400]  who go all over the world fighting for their Islamic jihad and they wanted to
[25:41.400 --> 25:47.600]  get rid of Muammar Gaddafi because he was a socialist and secular he paid lip
[25:47.600 --> 25:53.520]  service to Islam he did obviously keep a lot of money for himself and was
[25:53.520 --> 25:58.840]  corrupt but in the standards of dictators did build up the country did
[25:58.840 --> 26:04.920]  have a welfare state and that's all bye bye now Libya is going to be driven into
[26:04.920 --> 26:10.360]  the Stone Age just as America is in fact there's a new article out that's so
[26:10.360 --> 26:14.680]  important that we need to get out to everyone it just got published at
[26:14.680 --> 26:19.560]  info wars.com and prisonplanet.com I worked on this report with Paul Watson
[26:19.560 --> 26:26.760]  this morning Obama gets struggling Americans with energy rate hikes and as
[26:26.760 --> 26:32.080]  I said Drudge ran the Fort Worth Star Telegram Washington Post and others
[26:32.080 --> 26:36.960]  yesterday where they admitted that yes we're already having blackouts when it
[26:36.960 --> 26:40.920]  gets cold or gets hot and there's high energy demands because of the last six
[26:40.920 --> 26:45.760]  years of policies under Bush and now under Obama and now they're announcing
[26:45.760 --> 26:49.760]  massive plant closures these are plants that nothing comes out of them that
[26:49.760 --> 26:55.120]  water vapor and carbon dioxide but they've listed at the EPA carbon dioxide
[26:55.120 --> 27:01.640]  as a toxic waste now remember you exhale carbon dioxide plants then engage in
[27:01.640 --> 27:06.920]  photosynthesis with it and the Sun it's part of the carbon cycle it's part of
[27:06.920 --> 27:11.240]  our atmosphere it's part of the symbiotic relationship but that has been
[27:11.240 --> 27:15.240]  named as toxic and that's why they're calling for carbon taxes and carbon
[27:15.240 --> 27:20.080]  credits and a carbon allotment a ration for every man woman and child Congress
[27:20.080 --> 27:23.720]  would not pass this law two years ago when Obama brought it forward first
[27:23.720 --> 27:28.520]  piece of legislation he simply said I'll just have the EPA do it just like they
[27:28.520 --> 27:32.880]  couldn't get Congress to pass tax hikes they just got rid of Congress being able
[27:32.880 --> 27:37.920]  to bring bills forward and they now have a super Congress that does that and if
[27:37.920 --> 27:41.200]  the Congress doesn't pass their bills they just go ahead and pass whatever the
[27:41.200 --> 27:45.000]  super Congress wanted they say we've we've created this package up or down
[27:45.000 --> 27:49.480]  vote and if you say no they just implement the policies that's a
[27:49.480 --> 27:56.360]  dictatorship of this oligarchy I mean we are in incredible times gun control
[27:56.360 --> 28:04.160]  without laws now being implemented by the ATF the finally the they did
[28:04.160 --> 28:08.960]  something good for a change we'll see if they lose the case on purpose but
[28:08.960 --> 28:19.680]  finally even the so-called second amendment organization came out the
[28:19.680 --> 28:25.440]  National Rifle Association and is suing Obama over that so oh he is gonna
[28:25.440 --> 28:29.960]  legalize 300,000 deportees and all future deportees unless the president
[28:29.960 --> 28:33.240]  feels that they need to be deported he says maybe felons will be deported so
[28:33.240 --> 28:36.800]  Congress wouldn't legalize the Legals so Obama just violates federal immigration
[28:36.800 --> 28:41.600]  law and deportation law and waves as executive wand gun control executive
[28:41.600 --> 28:47.400]  wand wars executive wand super Congress executive wand carbon taxes
[28:47.400 --> 28:55.880]  executive wand waivers to insiders on healthcare laws to give him money campaign
[28:55.880 --> 29:04.440]  contributions magic executive wand and now energy rate increases for the few
[29:04.440 --> 29:07.200]  companies that are allowed to operate like General Electric who got the waiver
[29:07.200 --> 29:13.160]  in February they got the waiver that turns out their former executives at the
[29:13.160 --> 29:18.040]  EPA and the White House wrote the red the new regulations they wrote them just
[29:18.040 --> 29:23.880]  like big Agra last year wrote the Food Safety Act I mean why not if we don't
[29:23.880 --> 29:27.960]  have a government this constitutional and out of control you you don't think
[29:27.960 --> 29:34.320]  big corporations are gonna come in and pay them to pass legislation or put
[29:34.320 --> 29:39.240]  executive orders in place to shut down their competition absolutely and the
[29:39.240 --> 29:43.960]  government's getting away with all of it so what's gonna happen even more see

[33:39.760 --> 33:45.600]  have now publicly stolen more than 70 billion dollars of the Libyan people's
[33:45.600 --> 33:52.840]  investment they are going after the 144 tons of gold just like the US military on
[33:52.840 --> 33:59.800]  record went in with foreign contractors and robbed every one of the museums in
[33:59.800 --> 34:05.160]  Baghdad and then no one knows where it all went this is just outright total

[34:35.520 --> 34:40.080]  to Columbia and kill the FARC to consolidate the cocaine what you think
[34:40.080 --> 34:44.560]  you'd train Los Zetas 10,000 plus over the last decade and then send them down
[34:44.560 --> 34:50.080]  to Mexico to try to knock out the cartels and that you would then ever get
[34:50.080 --> 34:55.600]  your pension fund too of course the average military person didn't even get
[34:55.600 --> 34:59.280]  any of the drug money and isn't aware of it and it's compartmentalized but but
[34:59.280 --> 35:04.800]  we have a lawless criminal government completely lawless completely criminal
[35:04.800 --> 35:10.880]  and they're now engaging in bolder and bolder activities I'd say the type of
[35:10.880 --> 35:15.480]  corruption we saw under George Herbert Walker Bush a three and a half on the
[35:15.480 --> 35:19.880]  Richter scale it was going on but they were trying to keep it hidden under Bill
[35:19.880 --> 35:25.040]  Clinton the five on the Richter scale under George W. Bush a seven on the
[35:25.040 --> 35:30.640]  Richter scale under Obama it's a whopping 10 remember it grows
[35:30.640 --> 35:36.200]  exponentially on the Richter scale I mean now he's just I don't need Congress for

[38:35.000 --> 38:38.360]  financial terrorists are you are the terrorist and they know they're the
[38:38.360 --> 38:43.560]  terrorist they understand anybody who actually knows what America is really
[38:43.560 --> 38:48.760]  all about is a terrorist you look at the government training manuals returning
[38:48.760 --> 38:53.480]  veterans gun owners in the Fedders Ron Paul supporters Bob Barr supporters
[38:53.480 --> 39:00.960]  libertarian party supporters land rights activist by the way I was driving in I
[39:00.960 --> 39:05.360]  forgot to pull this up he was reading the news article the FDA is going after
[39:05.360 --> 39:09.160]  vitamin C now and he was Ben Fuchs was reading the articles well you guys type
[39:09.160 --> 39:16.440]  in food and drug administration moves to restrict or ban he was reading two
[39:16.440 --> 39:20.040]  different articles one article was restrict vitamin C the other was banned
[39:20.040 --> 39:23.360]  vitamin C over the counter and I know that's already starting in Europe under
[39:23.360 --> 39:27.480]  Codex Alimentarius I've got articles here where they're arresting people all
[39:27.480 --> 39:34.920]  over the United States now from DC to Washington State those are just the two
[39:34.920 --> 39:41.280]  articles today when you try to sell lemonade they don't just find you now
[39:41.280 --> 39:45.440]  if children come out and sell lemonade they're actually finding and threatening
[39:45.440 --> 39:52.080]  to arrest Girl Scout selling cookies now or Girl Scout popcorn I mean ladies and
[39:52.080 --> 39:56.880]  gentlemen it is on they're letting us know you live in a Soviet America where
[39:56.880 --> 40:00.880]  the where the book is thrown at average law abiding citizens and criminals are
[40:00.880 --> 40:10.000]  above the law it is so hard core it is so hard core like later we'll pull this
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.520]  video up and play it children defy police in Washington purchase lemonade in the
[40:14.520 --> 40:19.360]  capital city and are arrested it's incredible footage of the of them being
[40:19.360 --> 40:23.520]  threatened the police acting like they're narcotics traffickers and then
[40:23.520 --> 40:27.200]  meanwhile it's well-known you we had Serpico on Frank Serpico the legendary
[40:27.200 --> 40:32.440]  New York narcotics detective and I said around the time you got shot the face
[40:32.440 --> 40:38.320]  and run out of there I've read 75% of the detectives were later proven on the
[40:38.320 --> 40:46.120]  take and he said well in my group it was 100% 100% ladies and gentlemen the town
[40:46.120 --> 40:53.400]  I grew up in Rockwall I was not even a druggie I was a jock and I would go to
[40:53.400 --> 41:01.160]  parties and when I was 12 years old it started playing baseball down the
[41:01.160 --> 41:06.640]  street one of my friends invites me over his older brothers in high school cop
[41:06.640 --> 41:13.240]  shows up in uniform goes in the house sells him drugs to distribute and I'll
[41:13.240 --> 41:17.720]  never forget my buddy's big brother said hey when I was 13 a year later I had a
[41:17.720 --> 41:23.280]  moped and he said I'll pay you 20 bucks to deliver this marijuana to this house
[41:23.280 --> 41:28.560]  this house in that house of course I didn't do it and he got mad at me and
[41:28.560 --> 41:34.160]  didn't trust me anymore but the point is that's how America operates that's how
[41:34.160 --> 41:39.320]  America operates and I stood the cops would would be having dare programs and
[41:39.320 --> 41:43.440]  talking about the drug testing at the school and drug dogs and I would see
[41:43.440 --> 41:48.160]  cops that I knew were involved in drug dealing and I would say you're not going
[41:48.160 --> 41:52.520]  to search me I don't use drugs like you do and the cops would flip out take me
[41:52.520 --> 41:56.640]  out of the office slam my head in the desk and scream at me they were so mad
[41:56.640 --> 42:02.800]  that I wouldn't love their evil and bow down to their drug dealing anymore okay
[42:02.800 --> 42:09.840]  this is what America is rotten as Hades itself and if we don't admit this we
[42:09.840 --> 42:16.320]  have no future it's coming to a terminal head now you may live in a town where
[42:16.320 --> 42:27.600]  the cops don't deal the drugs but that's the exception not the rule all right I'm
[42:27.600 --> 42:35.240]  gonna shut up and go to your calls it's just that in my gut in my intellect in
[42:35.240 --> 42:39.280]  my spirit my discernment whatever you want to call it I am on the edge of my
[42:39.280 --> 42:46.640]  seat right now I've told you in the last year that my spidey sense we all have it
[42:46.640 --> 42:55.240]  my sixth sense my gut has been absolutely on edge like I'm at the edge of a
[42:55.240 --> 43:00.320]  cliff and now it's intensifying intensifying every hour they are
[43:00.320 --> 43:06.360]  preparing some type of World War three startup the globalist are preparing
[43:06.360 --> 43:13.960]  massive terror attacks in America and Europe and it is going to be hellish it
[43:13.960 --> 43:17.760]  is going to be absolutely horrible and we're gonna have to watch the murderers
[43:17.760 --> 43:26.400]  the social engineers who've done the attacks grandstand as our saviors and as
[43:26.400 --> 43:30.600]  the public gets scared during a depression and during a war they think
[43:30.600 --> 43:35.920]  you're gonna go along with their takeover of America and it's time for
[43:35.920 --> 43:41.280]  every radio talk show host every police officer every pastor every college
[43:41.280 --> 43:47.320]  professor every school teacher every doctor every lawyer every auto mechanic
[43:47.320 --> 43:57.200]  every farmer every rancher every factory worker every lawn person I don't
[43:57.200 --> 44:04.480]  care what you do every retail clerk to count the cost to face history to
[44:04.480 --> 44:09.840]  realize that while we've been tuned into a false reality of football and and
[44:09.840 --> 44:14.720]  and celebrity and all the rest of it that people are such experts on that
[44:14.720 --> 44:18.120]  reality's been going on all around you while you're busy out in the middle of
[44:18.120 --> 44:23.000]  a field watching a television and you think that television's the only thing
[44:23.000 --> 44:28.920]  in the world you didn't hear the wolves howling now the wolves are all around you
[44:28.920 --> 44:32.920]  in the dark and you can look out from the glow of the TV in the middle of this
[44:32.920 --> 44:37.720]  field we're in collectively and see their eyes and hear their growling and
[44:37.720 --> 44:42.040]  the television is telling you those are friends lay down show them your neck
[44:42.040 --> 44:47.920]  they want to lick it and the TV says lay down the wolves are here to help and
[44:47.920 --> 44:54.240]  many Americans are going okay all right here's my neck and we watch as
[44:54.240 --> 45:00.280]  Americans are grabbed by the wolves and drug out into the night good people have
[45:00.280 --> 45:05.280]  to get together around a code of ethics and ideas and defend those or
[45:05.280 --> 45:14.080]  civilization always falls one of the globalist biggest problems to handle
[45:14.080 --> 45:20.520]  is how do they balance the countries they're looting and how do they keep
[45:20.520 --> 45:24.560]  safe havens for themselves to move to after they've totally destroyed
[45:24.560 --> 45:30.760]  societies they want to play the military industrial complex foot soldiers the
[45:30.760 --> 45:34.240]  police the military the private contractors off against the American
[45:34.240 --> 45:40.200]  people but the 30 pieces of silver you're being given to carry out the
[45:40.200 --> 45:48.000]  destruction of America the conversion of America to a third world dictatorship
[45:48.000 --> 45:55.440]  of the plutocrats you're destroying your own nest your own future your children's
[45:55.440 --> 46:03.720]  future you are you are selling your birthright for nothing for nothing for
[46:03.720 --> 46:18.000]  a pittance I'm gonna go to Dana Lennon Carl Sean Sean and others but I just want to
[46:18.000 --> 46:26.880]  impart to you the magnitude of this we are entering a nightmare tyranny
[46:26.880 --> 46:35.760]  there is no doubt a nightmare it could stop anytime people start valuing
[46:35.760 --> 46:41.400]  liberty but when the average man thinks that being a man is lifting weights and
[46:41.400 --> 46:45.560]  having big muscles and strutting around and watching football and driving a big
[46:45.560 --> 46:52.280]  pickup truck and I like big pickup trucks too I'm saying that's not being a man
[46:52.280 --> 46:56.680]  doesn't mean you act like you're a man and act like you're looking for trouble
[46:56.680 --> 47:04.520]  with somebody that cuts in front of you at the grocery store at the liquor aisle
[47:06.160 --> 47:13.000]  being a man means you're informed being a man means you're involved being a man
[47:13.000 --> 47:20.400]  means that you see it as your absolute mission to defend our republic
[47:20.400 --> 47:28.600]  whatever the cost is and being a man means you have the courage to not be
[47:28.600 --> 47:34.120]  brainwashed and buy into the false psychological warfare paradigm that
[47:34.120 --> 47:43.000]  you're fed let's go to Dana in Alabama you're on the air thanks for holding hey
[47:43.000 --> 47:46.800]  Alex it's good to talk to you again good to talk to you sir what's on your mind

[47:52.680 --> 47:57.760]  but I've seen a lot of craziness by this government look my eyes are telling me
[47:57.760 --> 48:02.480]  something that my mind is telling me is impossible but it might be my spidey
[48:02.480 --> 48:07.920]  sense my spidey sense making me ask this question when is somebody gonna do a
[48:07.920 --> 48:15.400]  facial measurement comparison between photos of Osama and photos of Obama to
[48:15.400 --> 48:21.760]  prove whether or not this is the same person in these pictures they do look a
[48:21.760 --> 48:29.240]  little bit alike that is hilarious that Osama Obama oh by the way will you
[48:29.240 --> 48:34.240]  repull that strat for a very respected private intelligence group based here in
[48:34.240 --> 48:38.560]  Austin Texas that even does reportage for the federal government has come out
[48:38.560 --> 48:42.080]  and said that that wasn't been lied and they killed at that compound and then
[48:42.080 --> 48:46.120]  it's as phony as a three dollar bill Dana I appreciate your call that that's
[48:46.120 --> 48:51.280]  hilarious I know they've done the voice prints in universities in Canada and in
[48:51.280 --> 48:56.520]  France of the supposed bin Laden video audio of the new videos that came out
[48:56.520 --> 49:03.920]  in the last seven eight years and none of it was bin Laden okay let's go ahead

[54:46.080 --> 54:51.680]  many nights and we're developing it for prison planet TV members and we have a
[54:51.680 --> 54:57.360]  lot of cable networks and systems that are interested in picking it up like I've
[54:57.360 --> 55:00.760]  had people offer me you know hey produce the TV show and we'll put it on our
[55:00.760 --> 55:05.840]  cable system or we'll put it on the satellite system but I've had people
[55:05.840 --> 55:10.040]  come to us years ago and again this year even last month and say add it together
[55:10.040 --> 55:14.360]  every day the highlights of your three-hour radio show that's also streamed
[55:14.360 --> 55:18.320]  out as TV at prison planet TV that you know the production is pretty good we
[55:18.320 --> 55:22.960]  like to put it on this guy television feed or we'd like to put it on this
[55:22.960 --> 55:27.560]  German feed or this Japanese feed or this feed that's you know channel thousand
[55:27.560 --> 55:32.120]  something in the US and I just haven't had the time the energy to get that done
[55:32.120 --> 55:37.520]  but now that's what the news show is going to be about and so now is a
[55:37.520 --> 55:42.200]  better time than ever to become a member at prison planet TV and one of my
[55:42.200 --> 55:48.000]  great IT people's father died of a heart attack last week we would have already
[55:48.000 --> 55:52.760]  launched some new features for prison planet TV but his dad died last Monday
[55:52.760 --> 55:58.800]  and so he isn't coming back until Wednesday we could have already launched
[55:58.800 --> 56:01.680]  it too but we need him here to make sure when we do we launched these new
[56:01.680 --> 56:06.120]  features at present planet dot TV so our prayers go out to that particular
[56:06.120 --> 56:11.520]  individual here in the office okay Lenin yeah you gotta be clear we had the
[56:11.520 --> 56:16.760]  front man Al Jorgensen of ministry on saying everything's gonna collapse so
[56:16.760 --> 56:20.480]  bad you won't even want gold so wasn't Dave Mustaine that you heard
[56:20.480 --> 56:30.040]  criticizing gold right and so you know he could be right in effect that this
[56:30.040 --> 56:35.160]  economy looks like it's gonna collapse the world economy looks like it's gonna
[56:35.160 --> 56:40.480]  collapse it was done by design by Ivy League economists like Paul Krugman who
[56:40.480 --> 56:44.920]  and his Nobel Nobel laureate speech said there's gonna be a rise of firms
[56:44.920 --> 56:50.400]  and we're setting this corporate talk or see up the fascist economy up well it
[56:50.400 --> 56:54.560]  doesn't look like it we've got the IMF World Bank documents and that's how we
[56:54.560 --> 57:00.440]  predicted all this with total precision this is a hundred percent scripted right
[57:00.440 --> 57:04.880]  but when it does collapse you see there's still gonna need to be a store of
[57:04.880 --> 57:12.600]  wealth and a means of exchange and by definition gold is money and let me just
[57:12.600 --> 57:17.200]  run through this for listen listen Lenin if people don't understand this
[57:17.200 --> 57:21.200]  they're never gonna understand it if they don't understand that the dollars
[57:21.200 --> 57:28.520]  been devalued so gold's almost 1900 and silver was $5 and it's 43 today it's an
[57:28.520 --> 57:33.600]  industrial metal it's always been money since civilization existed and it's a
[57:33.600 --> 57:37.200]  hedge against inflation and it's something you can barter with and it's
[57:37.200 --> 57:41.680]  easily transportable store of wealth if people don't understand that that in
[57:41.680 --> 57:46.920]  Africa 5,000 years ago it was money in China 5,000 years ago it was money that
[57:46.920 --> 57:52.320]  was money with the Aztecs 2,000 years ago you're not going to be able to
[57:52.320 --> 57:55.800]  explain it to them I appreciate your call you're not gonna be able to explain
[57:55.800 --> 58:02.360]  it listen Mike Adams wrote a really nice article about me because he's had a
[58:02.360 --> 58:06.480]  chance to come in our office and see that we're here working hard and it's the

[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:13.960]  total collapse total depression but you'll still get to act tough and
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:20.240]  waddle around and deal narcotics to people so both of those videos are up at
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:25.600]  info wars.com and prisonplanet.com city shuts down cancer victims yard sale
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:31.360]  and they're telling the police don't really respond to major crimes in many
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:36.720]  cities like Oakland where they don't respond to 35 major crimes go out and
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:43.200]  revenue generate and if a cop complains you're fired okay we're here to raise
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:47.240]  money that's it and they tell the cops keep raising money you won't lose your
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:50.760]  job or you won't get your pay cut but in the end you're gonna lose everything
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:55.040]  you see because you made a deal with the devil and you went along with it and
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:58.840]  the same thing for the bureaucrats and the defense contractors and all of you
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:05.760]  who let us get to this point all of you who who sold out and decided corruption
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:11.480]  was okay well now we have sown the win we're gonna reap the whirlwind Jan
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:15.640]  Klein was holding yard sales each weekend in her backyard to raise money to pay
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:19.080]  her medical bills but the city of Salem shut her down after a neighbor
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:25.760]  complained ah good good Stasi a city ordinance prohibits people from holding
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:30.120]  more than three yard sales a year the city has the ordinance because it says
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:34.440]  in the past people had set up flea market-style sales on their property the
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:37.520]  story galvanized people who were outraged at the city wouldn't make an
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:41.520]  exception how about freedom how about if you want to go somewhere where you're
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:45.800]  not allowed to have yard sales you go and and move into one of these little
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:52.320]  Nazi homeowners associations which almost always have corruption and money
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:57.840]  stealing going on in them go go do that but but people live in regular houses
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.920]  they should have their own rights the city ordinances where you can't have
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:05.360]  gardens or you can't have garage sales baloney and now they're annexing rural
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:08.640]  areas and pulling up in front of old farmers houses saying get rid of those
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:12.440]  old tractors and those old junk cars and the old lady your old man looks at him
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:16.120]  and says sonny get out of here then the old man you've seen the cases doesn't pay
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.400]  the fines he holds himself up in the house the SWAT team comes and shoots him
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:24.160]  and then goes out and has beers afterwards that's what men do they kill
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:30.120]  old veterans now that's how things operate here these are real tough guys
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:33.200]  here you know they like to kill Americans and they do and they will kill
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:37.600]  more don't worry meanwhile the big mega banks can steal tens of trillions of
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:42.160]  dollars and get in zero trouble major mega banks can launder hundreds of
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:45.920]  millions of dollars a year publicly no one gets in trouble came out last week
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:50.280]  what we already knew you know the Bernie Madoff situation insiders for 11 years
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:55.800]  gave the SEC the Securities and Exchange Commission total dossiers on what
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:13:02.800]  Madoff was doing and nothing was done except for having the dossiers destroyed
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:08.880]  now it turns out in thousands of insider reports of corruptions oh yeah back it up
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:14.520]  the evil eliminate sales people were trying to go the officer got him good
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:18.960]  good good good and if you try to have a yard sale he's gonna get you try to sell
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:24.840]  tomatoes he's gonna get you all over the country it's not just not just at a park
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:31.560]  you know 400 yards away from the supreme rulers you know the people's park oh
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:37.520]  look at him patting her down yes patting the terrorists down they'll show you
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:42.200]  meanwhile Obama just violated federal law and legalized 300,000 illegals who
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:47.000]  were being held for deportation deportation is over the migra no longer
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:53.720]  exist haha and the law no longer exist only general electric and two other
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:57.840]  companies are exempt to keep their power plants open all others are to be shut
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:02.240]  down you'll now have rolling blackouts and massive power increased prices but
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:06.600]  so what it's all part of the fun wars without congressional approval gun
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:11.800]  control without laws the great time of evil is here oh and don't think you're
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:15.560]  gonna vote out Obama and the next puppet's gonna save you oh no I'm afraid
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:20.440]  it's going to only get worse unless you elect a Ron Paul who's never
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:24.080]  compromised and who has identified the exact problem and been proven right
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:28.080]  that's why the whole system is against him Republican Democrat pundits across
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:34.480]  the board Pew research shows less media coverage than any other candidate because
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:38.200]  they're scared but they're not gonna really criticize except for the
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:42.400]  White House to do it to elevate him Rick Perry saying that the Fed is almost
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:47.560]  treasonous no those that go along with the ones that are treasonous it's a
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:51.880]  foreign entity it's doing what foreign corporate entities do it's taking over
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:57.280]  it's it's it's had a corporate takeover of America and the cops know about
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:01.760]  football scores and how to act tough and how to get a handout on the side when
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:07.840]  they turn their turn they're blind it's got to feel good to be these cops in
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:11.120]  these corrupt cities where they literally got their bellies hanging out the
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:14.520]  hats are on the back of their heads they'll smoke cigarettes or cigars right
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:17.880]  in front of you you walk up with your family in New York and say officer do
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:21.200]  you know where this is they will to families just say do I look like a
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:24.960]  phone book to you I mean even a gangbanger would tell you where something
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:30.320]  was but they're so hard and so gangster and so rolling that they want you to know
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:38.120]  you're a scum dirt slime filth trash in New York the police the model of
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:42.680]  America are so corrupt that if you're protesting they'll walk up on camera and

[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:59.200]  charge you with terror hardcore felony calling in a fake bomb threat on video
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:03.160]  they even hand you the camera because they are invincible the heroin the
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:07.080]  cocaine now they're into kidnapping little kids and selling them overseas the
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:11.880]  pure evil of hell has been released just like in Soviet Russia just like in
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:16.760]  Nazi Germany now good people could still wake up and turn this around but
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:21.760]  you're going to have to face the facts and get upset we're gonna go to Sean
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:25.440]  next and others but first I wanted to just briefly for three minutes bring
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:30.000]  Ted Anderson up with today's Midas gold update of where silver and gold is and
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.360]  what's happening in the markets Ted Anderson tell us what's going on well
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:39.600]  we've seen a high of 1895 10 on gold $44 silver my god it's just running up
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:46.560]  1888 40 current on gold 43 37 silver I mean it Alex I'm just reading all the
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:49.560]  articles that I have from Bloomberg and writers I mean they're all talking about
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:55.040]  the economy turning down worldwide and gold is just climbing I mean almost
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:17:00.680]  $1,900 an ounce today that $2,000 is so short and around the corner when I
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:04.880]  wouldn't doubt it a bit that if we see it within two months there's no question
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:08.720]  about it people should get moving in addition to this I've held down prices
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:14.160]  on Franks and British sovereigns walking Liberty halves $20 gold pieces 10s
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:18.840]  I've got a whole a whole proof of different items that you can be picking up
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:24.560]  I even capped even those silvers at $44 an ounce now you're special for the book
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:31.400]  and the DVD the American dream at 83 bucks Alex and you that's that's below
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:34.760]  the cost on the silver dollars themselves add the videos in the
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:39.000]  postage and everything else in there take advantage of it now because I can't
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.880]  keep doing it because of the fact that the prices have just shot up like a
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:48.320]  rocket I mean right now I've got Franks at 406 currently Franks right now even
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:52.200]  on my internet prices which are incredibly competitive Franks right now

[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:52.600]  memories and in the other chip connect to 65k synapses they're trying to create
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:57.320]  an artificial humanoid brain and of course much of this they admit is for
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:05.920]  implantation into humans they were fabricated using 45 NMSOICOM OS's
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:11.320]  synapses aims to replicate the computing power of the human brain within the size
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:16.800]  and power consumption restraints of the human brain IBM calls its two prototype
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:23.720]  chips neurosynaptic nodes aimed at cognitive computing so they don't they're
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:29.000]  not going to need humans pretty soon for their military the globalist military
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.480]  they're already converting everything over to drones in the air and soon on the
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:38.520]  ground that's why the elites all write publications saying they don't need us
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:49.000]  anymore does the future need a bunch of arrested development TV watchers who
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.680]  have no idea what time it is well I'm here to warn everybody and maybe folks
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:59.800]  want to listen it's a fact that most major vaccines that are tested are filled
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:03.720]  with live cancer viruses you might enjoy the fact that cancer is exploding you
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:08.600]  might like being murdered think it's cute I don't I'm an extremist I'm a weirdo
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:16.840]  let's go ahead and take a call here let's talk to Sean welcome Sean in North
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:21.480]  Carolina thanks for holding thanks Alex how are you doing today I'm doing all
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:31.200]  right sir I have two issues for you one I keep getting on the rush radio show in
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:37.960]  Greensboro and Raleigh I debated the talk show host there I forget what her name
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:43.520]  was Demetria I believe and we're discussing Palin how she's wanting to
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:49.240]  go into into the election if she's gonna do it or if not and the thing about her
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:54.720]  was she was saying that voters were stupid and then she said well between
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:27:02.960]  these four candidates Sarah Palin Bachman Perry and some other one she
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:08.640]  didn't even mention Ron Paul sir that's the talking point everywhere they're
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:13.360]  told to do this or they're weak-minded and see the mainstream media not doing
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:17.040]  it so they go oh I want to be establishment they say we can't talk
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:21.680]  about him why he's only the leader a number one number two or number three
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:25.720]  anyway you slice it he's a key front-runner and he's been right about
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:29.760]  everything let's just again they get into the petty power trip of keeping
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:36.080]  info from people they enjoy playing like their globalist controllers it was
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:41.360]  really funny Alex when I mentioned well Ron Paul the constant guest on Alex
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:48.360]  Jones of info wars calm and he's always right and so is Ron Paul and the
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:54.840]  since I said your name on there they started oh it was hilarious but anyway
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:58.720]  I wanted to thank you for waking me up and thank you for what you're doing well
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:07.040]  thank you so much sir I appreciate you calling I've studied history I haven't
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:12.600]  lived through Soviet occupation or Nazi brutalization or Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:17.960]  in Cambodia or the hundreds of other examples but I've studied it and let me
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:23.520]  tell you there's no doubt the globalists want to break America forever they want
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:29.360]  to really bring in a hardcore tyranny not a soft tyranny and they want arrest
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:36.040]  and purges and persecutions in all the civil wars that come with that just like
[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:41.120]  what they're doing in Libya they want destabilization they'll sit back let us
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:47.240]  have a war with each other for years in a deep depression and out of it they
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:51.080]  believe from their studies that they're going to have the central government
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:57.200]  come out on top and a type of 21st century reconstruction and out of it a
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:03.680]  metamorphosized America they cut off the food and water and electricity for
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:13.120]  long enough the the tyranny gets bad enough
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:23.520]  they think that you're going to break they think that you're going to give
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:27.920]  into whatever they say that's why they've worked so hard to eradicate any
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:33.640]  type of barter any type of gardens any type of lemonade stands girl scouts they
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:37.720]  don't want you they want to extinguish the practice of people meeting at the
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:41.560]  town square in the old days that's what the town square is where the open
[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:46.200]  markets were they want to make you go to the big box stores to buy the Chinese
[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:52.600]  slave goods everything is about forming a monopoly we're on the march the

[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.840]  atheist and a citizen of the world he has appeared as a guest on Oprah Winfrey
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:13.760]  show Glenn Beck you name it NBC nightly news trendsresearch.com and again it was
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:20.280]  a dead cat bounce he said by the end of 2010 you're going to know we're in a
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:25.520]  depression and every real housing number jobless number social security cola
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:34.080]  number every inflation number every single number show that by every classical
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:39.000]  benchmark we were in a depression and when the government didn't announce a
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.920]  depression in December some people said oh look so let me say we'd be in a
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:46.920]  depression well now they're saying it's the greatest recession and the former
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:50.640]  head of the private fellow reserve told me the press don't worry we won't
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:56.520]  default we'll just print more money that is a default just unbelievable things
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:01.240]  are now being admitted I wish that I was wrong I wish Gerald was wrong but he's
[01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:11.960]  been absolutely right and he had the the guts the Cajones the Wavos to actually
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:17.000]  put a date on it and so what happened is we were in the big depression by the
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  time he said we would be but they said that no no no no no everything's fine
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.480]  and and still they're saying well we're in the greatest recession but but don't
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:30.800]  worry everything's going to be okay as they simply stall all they put their
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:35.960]  police state in Gerald Salente break it down for us please sir well you hit on
[01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:41.680]  it Alex they're covering it up this came out of Bloomberg yesterday it's not in
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:46.640]  today's Wall Street Journal it's not in that Turlett paper record the New York
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:55.280]  Times and it's not even in the Financial Times Wall Street aristocracy got 1.2
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:42:05.680]  trillion in fed secret loans that's what they did as all these banks like JP
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:14.440]  Morgan Chase like the Goldman Sachs gang like the city group criminals like the
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:21.640]  Barkley bandits who all said hey our balance sheets are okay things are
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:28.840]  really fine they were getting tens of billions of dollars worth of loans Alex
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:34.760]  loans like you would get and maybe I'll charge you 1% because you're one of the
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:41.040]  white shoe boys they keep propping up this Ponzi scheme and they keep lying to
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:46.640]  us and the only reason these numbers just came out is because of the Dodd
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:53.240]  Frank bill but there's that clause in there you know the insanity clause we
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:59.440]  got to wait two years before we release these numbers because you know we don't
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:04.120]  want people to see the real truth and they may pull their money out of these
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:09.640]  criminal organizations so they give us this baloney that that's why they can't
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:14.680]  put out these numbers and this is only what we're seeing look what Obama look
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:20.400]  where he's on that vacation again you know where did he spend last night oh at
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:25.640]  the Presta Toots house that's right the guy that owns NBC
[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:32.920]  Comcast it's all one club and we're not in it and you know you were talking
[01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:39.320]  about you know Venezuela North Korea now now this is fascism USA I said it
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:44.520]  when Obama got elected I said it when you did the Obama deception and that's
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:52.240]  what it is it's the merger of state and corporate powers you pointed out all the
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:57.720]  breaks that the big guys get like general electric you know like all of them
[01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:03.480]  they get the allowances while they are screwing the little people you mention
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:09.840]  it the lemonade stands the cheese how about that awesome foods incident that
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:16.720]  you reported on a couple of weeks ago in Los Angeles where the food Gestapo came
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:22.120]  in and busted them and they were only supposed to take representative samples
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:26.200]  of what they was what they were it's a club they weren't even selling this
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:31.680]  stuff you belong to a club and what do they do a representative sample happened
[01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:38.280]  to be every piece of article in the joint so now as I'm speaking look at the
[01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:46.360]  price of gold one thousand eight hundred and eighty nine dollars an ounce and we
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:50.880]  had forecast at the beginning of this year I'm on all the major media two
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:58.040]  thousand dollars an ounce why is it going up one simple reason the entire
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:03.600]  global financial system is collapsing and only the little children believe
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:08.240]  that it's going to be safe and let me throw this at you let me throw this at
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:13.400]  you because you did predict two thousand by the end of the year a bold
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:17.760]  prediction and that was a long time ago you made that prediction and it's
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:20.880]  because you've been proven right that they're not going to be inviting you on
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:24.640]  all these shows and all these newspapers aren't going to interview you that called
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:31.000]  you a pessimist porno dealer just like the Pew research showed Ron Paul is
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.680]  getting less coverage than any other candidate including candidates that have
[01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:38.840]  dropped out because in reality he's in the top three candidates he's a major
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:44.040]  front-runner and he's been right so they're going to ignore him but when
[01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:49.920]  you're a liar well then they'll put you on national television it's because it's
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:56.160]  the houses of prostitution they're just there to serve their masters you just saw
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:46:03.680]  Obama make a trip to the master's house at Comcast this yesterday up at Martha's
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:08.240]  Vineyard and that's all it is and I'm not a member I told you I think you know
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:12.160]  there also might be I think maybe they don't like the way I dress and I don't
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:16.840]  wear those Brooks Brothers suits you know and maybe this Salenti does a ring
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:22.880]  right with them or that Bronx accent so I'm going to become maybe a J. Endicott
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:30.600]  Crestcott the third and if that doesn't work maybe Josh O'Shaughnessy Greenberg
[01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:34.760]  then I really be brilliant you know
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:40.600]  like first and now the third and then change your name to Winford Springfield
[01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:52.760]  Dmitry Rockefeller the 17th oh yeah yeah yeah they got these guys on CNBC
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:58.360]  every day you know I you can't it's like it's a comic so going back to what's
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:04.080]  going on let's look what's going on over in Europe the game is over they're
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:09.640]  talking about Euro bonds Merkel doesn't want to do it nobody really does so
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:14.200]  that's collapsing where they're going to get the money they're in zero interest
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:20.120]  rates so as we're talking the stock market took a little pop-up today why
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:29.120]  this is what they have the goal to say on the good news that Ben Bernanke may
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:37.360]  announce QE3 by the end of the week the good news great more digital money not
[01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:43.240]  worth the paper it's not printed on will keep those interest rates near zero so
[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:47.960]  all you people out there that used to put money in the bank and think you were
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:52.360]  going to get a return on it you're not gonna get anything unless you invest in
[01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:57.920]  the Ponzi scheme called Wall Street the whole system is collapsing and you
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:03.680]  mentioned about Biden being over in China sucking up and bowing down there's a
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:08.360]  photo of them last week he's walking down the gangplank you know this what
[01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:13.320]  Air Force to you know this this plane is big enough to move there for city you
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:18.080]  know and he's holding a hand of this young attractive woman I say wow who's
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:24.000]  that and at the end it's his granddaughter Naomi and here you know
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:29.040]  they got all these guys saluting the red carpet what kind of baloney is this I
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:33.280]  thought he's going over there to do business he takes his granddaughter
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:37.520]  with him you know and who's paying for this stuff it's the same like Hillary
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:43.200]  Clinton she said Chelsea to the to the soccer game you know to cheer on the
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:49.600]  team everybody get this straight you have a royalty in his country
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:55.720]  Harvard Princeton Yale the bullets banks and bombs club and the only time
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:49:02.720]  when they want you is for cannon fodder and to pick your pocket so people that
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:08.400]  believe that you're going to have change you could believe in whether of voting
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:13.800]  for the Republicans and the Democrats you better grow up if you haven't grown
[01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:19.200]  up by now absolutely I want to play a clip for you and get your take on it to
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:26.360]  have Greenspan on meet the prostitutes to adopt your term that's I'm noticing is
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:29.760]  now becoming popularized so you've you've actually coined a phrase that's
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:34.360]  not going to be in popular use they say that's a real sign of true influence so
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:38.920]  congratulations the prostitutes and I hope our listeners will start using it
[01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:43.760]  he was on meet the prostitutes and he said hey don't worry we're not going to
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:47.880]  default we'll just print money and they had the former White House financial
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:53.600]  advisor on there at Ghoulsby and he literally got shaken up and couldn't
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:58.320]  believe that Greenspan just said that so they've got the Hutzpah the arrogance
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:04.400]  to come right out in the open and say we're gonna devalue the dollar down to
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:09.960]  nothing let's play that clip here it is our US Treasury bonds still safe to
[01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:17.280]  invest in very much so I think there's a this is not an issue of credit rating
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:24.120]  the United States can pay any debt it has because we can always print money to
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:31.200]  do that so there is zero probability of default what and he's up there with a
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:34.960]  skull and bones or when we come back we'll get Gerald Salente's take on that
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:39.600]  and the skull and bones guy who's the other guest with him literally starts
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:44.120]  smiling you could tell as an adrenaline rush and you see a little bit of flush
[01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:48.280]  to come to his face he actually he actually blushes like he goes my gosh
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:53.520]  that was just said and that's what Gerald was just getting into QE3 is like
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:58.040]  another bullet in the head I'll explain what this means on the other side the

[01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:22.560]  board we'd love to hear from you 800-259-9231 I've got a host of other
[01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:28.360]  issues I want to pick Gerald Salente's brain on but Gerald finishing up with
[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:33.000]  that clip we just played before the break of Greenspan with a very arrogant
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:36.760]  look on his face this is the guy that told Lair News Hour that the Federal
[01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:41.320]  Reserve is above the law and its own branch of government she I didn't read
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:46.200]  that in the Constitution plus it's private I mean when does it end because
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:50.280]  they're old men and look like they've been put in a microwave and are wearing
[01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:54.760]  suits we've got to just let them gut and destroy everything what does it
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:59.400]  signify that they're talking about just printing money to a Weimar Republic
[01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:07.320]  level and that they're openly talking about QE3 Gerald well again look now
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:11.640]  what is gold at now it's eight eight thousand one thousand eight hundred and
[01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:17.120]  ninety one dollars an ounce so that's what they're doing maybe you remember the
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:21.800]  old Weimar Republic they had the wheel barrows maybe we could have Bernanke
[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:26.680]  barrows now so you could load them up we'll put bungee cords on them to hold
[01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:31.760]  the money in so you could buy a loaf of bread there's not one thing I agree with
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:36.200]  with that guy Rick Perry over there that's running for president except this
[01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:42.600]  one thing about him saying that Bernanke should be brought up for treason and so
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:48.800]  should this other guy Greenspan and by the way everything that these guys
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:53.400]  predicted has been wrong just just for the record but they keep bringing them
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:57.880]  back for their expertise they are robbing the people in front of our
[01:55:57.880 --> 01:56:04.360]  eyes I read to you that piece of Bloomberg that was reported yesterday
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:14.000]  1.2 trillion dollars go into JP Morgan Chase go into credit suites Society
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:21.520]  General Barclays and not a nickel for you or a nickel for me no no our tax money
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:27.160]  had to pay for this by the way MSNBC got hundreds of millions of dollars and as
[01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:31.360]  you said earlier and I have the article here who does he go visit but the head of
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:36.880]  Comcast that owns MSNBC and literally the subsidiaries they took control of are
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:41.840]  getting government money and so they talk about other people having state-run
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:47.600]  media we have state-run media it's just foreign banker run through the state I
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:53.600]  mean it's ridiculous it's state-run media you have it by the way if anybody
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:59.840]  wants to get a glimpse of what's going on over in Libya I suggest you tune into
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:04.960]  RT you know Russian to Russia today because they're the only ones that are
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:11.840]  getting another side of the story and just like the prostitutes got us into
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:17.120]  that Iraq war remember that one remember Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:23.000]  destruction remember Katie Corick on the today's show walking across that map on
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:28.440]  the floor with that other prostitute what's that guy that former general they
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:34.440]  always dredge up all the time to send the people to war and they do it all
[01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:40.960]  remember the New York Times to print the paper the toilet paper a record about
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:48.080]  Saddam Hussein's yellow cape and an aluminum tubes their liars that all
[01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:55.520]  they're doing is what every prostitute does they serve their masters and if you
[01:57:55.520 --> 01:58:00.120]  were to put them all together you wouldn't come up with one pair of
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:06.480]  cojones among them all they're all suck ups and sellouts and they're selling

[02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:46.160]  Fox News headline 9-1-1 first responders to be excluded from 10th
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:53.280]  anniversary ceremony because it's seen that they are disgruntled about the fact
[02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:56.840]  the government knowingly lied about the deadly dust well you shouldn't believe
[02:08:56.840 --> 02:09:01.920]  the government guys and that it's seen at their hostile the government now now
[02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:05.320]  when I've been down at ground zero a couple years after it happened and was
[02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:09.640]  saying 9-1-1 was an inside job about half the folks were getting mad at me
[02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:15.280]  firemen police folks like that the last time I was there two three years ago
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:20.000]  they were all patting me on the back shaking my hand captains and fire
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:24.080]  department commanders and police commanders were nodding and smiling and
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:28.360]  saying we appreciate you Alex we know we know and I was like say that on tape
[02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:34.040]  was like no just know we know it was incredible and I'm not getting Gerald
[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:39.840]  off into that the point is is that that's why they're excluded Fox News AP
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:45.920]  Reuters again the first responder heroes ten years later are excluded why
[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:50.480]  because the vast majority of them know that those buildings were all blown sky
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:55.840]  high and they know they're angry they got their phones tapped you name it okay
[02:09:55.840 --> 02:10:05.480]  now Gerald digressing into another area it just came out in the nation magazine
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:12.240]  that strat for a large and establishment global intelligence private
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:16.120]  intelligence group that's been around for a very long time based in Austin
[02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:21.160]  Texas has come out and the nation magazines reporting strat for disputes
[02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:26.400]  OBL killing an obama bod and it goes on to say globally recognized intelligence
[02:10:26.400 --> 02:10:31.040]  and forecast strat for has rejected the US central intelligence claim that the
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:35.680]  man killed an obama bod compound by US Navy SEALs was al-Qaeda chief of
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:39.280]  summit bin Laden this was one of the reasons the CIA kept Pakistan's
[02:10:39.280 --> 02:10:44.480]  premier intelligence agency interservice intelligence in the dark and it goes on
[02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:50.760]  to say it's not true wow my my intel is it's totally fake I know you've laughed
[02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:54.320]  at the cement shoe thing but that's a big deal with somebody like strat for
[02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:58.200]  because they're highly respected comes out could we be coming to the end of the
[02:10:58.200 --> 02:11:02.640]  lies could people go ahead and realize there's no future if we don't stop going
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:07.880]  along with it no now I don't see that happening not the way it is now the whole
[02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:12.800]  game is so rigged we have such little freedom where do we where do we voice
[02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:17.280]  our discontent you have the Republicans and the Democrats you know how I feel
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:22.240]  about it the bananas of the Gambino's at your choice no it's not going to change
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:27.640]  until the individual changes Alex it's a much deeper issue than that as I see it
[02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:32.760]  that means my belief I believe it's you know it's emotional it's like it's
[02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:39.480]  spiritual it's physical and it's emotional and until those levels change
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:43.640]  morality has to come back but people have to live that near individual lives
[02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:48.280]  and I'm not talking about this phony you know religious stuff we know where
[02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:52.520]  people tell you they are I know the real God and this is what it says I'm gonna
[02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:57.080]  talk about that one I'm talking about the inner truth and and most people
[02:11:57.080 --> 02:12:01.520]  haven't reached that yet you look at the you look at the state of the nation you
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:06.960]  look at this presidential reality show going on I mean it's bad theater I mean
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:11.160]  every time you see one of these candidates that show up in a farm state
[02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:15.840]  you think they could ever sit anywhere other than on a bail a hay and the
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:20.720]  people keep buying this baloney so it's until the individual changes is that
[02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:26.960]  wonderful Hindus saying when the students ready the teacher appears and
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:31.280]  right now I don't believe the people are ready spiritually emotionally or
[02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:36.920]  physically well I agree the average man thinks that watching football is what
[02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:42.640]  it is to be a male not to be informed involved in their community and I mean
[02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:48.240]  real men the old-fashioned icon of it was not wanting to be a chump not being
[02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:53.240]  conned being independent and and and not trusting the government and being
[02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:57.960]  involved in your community now the men just basically just run around acting
[02:12:57.960 --> 02:13:03.480]  like adolescents women act like tarts and is there any wonder that we've been
[02:13:03.480 --> 02:13:09.840]  totally taken over by criminal interest and it's more than that it's it's the
[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:14.480]  drugs to and I'm not talking about and let's stop this baloney this war on
[02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:19.920]  drugs and busting people for pot what a lot of crap that is how about busting
[02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:25.040]  people for Xanax and all these wonderful drugs they put out there like you know
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:31.800]  oxy cotton there's a good winner for you so all these drugs these riddolins and
[02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:37.200]  the tons of drugs that people are taking the anti-depressants that's added
[02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:43.000]  into it as well and and as you mentioned about men and this is as I said you
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:46.800]  know when people upright have an uprising in this country these aren't
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:52.160]  just mommy's boys they're soccer mommy's boys look at these guys these
[02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:58.000]  prestitute reporters out there I mean again you know they're the goody two
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:03.320]  shoes I got an email from someone today that said they weren't renewing their
[02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:08.440]  subscription I'm not making this one up they said that although they bought gold
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:15.480]  in 2008 I think gold was trading for what about that six seven hundred dollars
[02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:21.280]  back then and and although they were a little more 800 I think so it's double
[02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:26.600]  more than double now and they did very well on our forecast by believing the
[02:14:26.600 --> 02:14:34.960]  forecast we haven't given enough information on how moms could do more to
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:43.760]  help their kids how moms could do more this is a soccer mommy society look at
[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:50.560]  the TV shows look at the commercials have you ever seen a guy that could put
[02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:56.480]  one foot in front of his other without tripping over or being helped by some
[02:14:56.480 --> 02:15:02.760]  smart woman that's what I wanted to say women watch TV and men have bought into
[02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:07.320]  the roll deck like goofballs but women so much the time really want to boss
[02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:11.160]  everybody around on average and they buy into this idea that they're the
[02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:15.080]  government enforcer and the government's their friend and and it was
[02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:18.440]  Hitler that said first you get the women then you've you know got the
[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:24.040]  children so follow the men and it's really true but hey don't worry I mean
[02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:28.280]  look Madison Avenue knows that women make about 80% of the purchases it's
[02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:31.600]  not that women are dumb or bad they've been targeted and they've bought into
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:36.160]  the little narrative that that Obama's gonna help them and stuff and they're
[02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:40.320]  gonna enjoy the Road Warrior Society that they've helped conjure and again if
[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:44.560]  the whole country's been feminized and if it's not that if it's not the the
[02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:49.960]  women that is the little kids I haven't met a little kid yet that isn't either
[02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:58.520]  amazing brilliant or special so it's either the little kids that are smarter
[02:15:58.520 --> 02:16:04.880]  than the guys or the women so the whole country's become feminized look at
[02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:12.760]  Congress look at these guys every one of them the only one again I have any
[02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:17.680]  respect for is Ron Paul I've said this I don't agree with him on some of his
[02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:23.040]  libertarian issues particularly on the environment and other but overall that's
[02:16:23.040 --> 02:16:29.360]  who I would cast my vote for at least he speaks his mind and has a spine the
[02:16:29.360 --> 02:16:34.960]  other ones go with the wind or else they help the special interests that give
[02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:41.000]  them the most so the nation is in this state so when you ask me will people
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:46.720]  wake up no not until they grow up absolutely let's take a few calls here
[02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:54.760]  let's talk to Ari in California you're on the air Ari thanks for holding hey
[02:16:54.760 --> 02:17:00.280]  hi Alex thanks for taking my call welcome what's on your mind I am gonna go
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:05.040]  off topic here a little bit but you mentioned something that at the beginning
[02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:10.400]  of your show today and I've heard you say that a few times before and it was
[02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:18.720]  about Serbia and NATO yes now somebody who lived through Coastal War I have no
[02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:23.320]  doubt they'll probably had their own interest to go there but to portray
[02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:28.960]  Serbia as some victim like you often do I just don't understand from somebody
[02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:34.360]  who is as informed as you are no no I'm not saying that Tito before was some
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:38.120]  great guy and I understand that both sides everybody was killing each other
[02:17:38.120 --> 02:17:43.880]  I'm not I mean I don't have any Serbian background so I don't have a dog in the
[02:17:43.880 --> 02:17:49.760]  hunt here what I was saying was is just like Libya they're going in creating a
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:55.040]  civil war they did fund Muslim groups out of Albania to attack the Serbs I'm
[02:17:55.040 --> 02:17:59.360]  talking about that into the war when NATO then came in and used to pleaded
[02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:05.120]  uranium and what came out of that do you have any comments on this Gerald yes I
[02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:11.000]  do in one of my books with Zizi gave honey boy I wrote about how USA today
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:16.520]  came out in an article years later saying how the United States and they
[02:18:16.520 --> 02:18:21.920]  did it on July 4th weekend when nobody was reading the newspapers about how
[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:26.680]  they trumped up the atrocities and it wasn't as bad as the United States said
[02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:32.240]  and the bottom line of course to all of this is it's none of our business how
[02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:38.160]  about straightening out Detroit cleaning up East St. Louis or St. Louis so it's
[02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:44.480]  this whole idea of the United States spreading democracy when we're taking
[02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:49.280]  it away from us over in our country over here that's my point is that they were
[02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:52.960]  knocking out the strongest country in the middle of all that and they were
[02:18:52.960 --> 02:18:57.520]  using al-Qaeda just as they're using al-Qaeda in Libya and ma'am I
[02:18:57.520 --> 02:19:00.560]  appreciate your call in fact maybe you should send me an email with your
[02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:05.120]  perspective perhaps I read it on air but I want to pick up on that as well
[02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:10.360]  because Serbia that you because the former Yugoslavia was the only country
[02:19:10.360 --> 02:19:15.600]  that was not buying in to that whole capitalist wave that was another issue
[02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:21.360]  because if you remember during the communist days Yugoslavia was doing
[02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:26.240]  better than just about anybody they were trying to export that you go wasn't
[02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:30.520]  much of an automobile but they were way ahead they were making some of the
[02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:36.080]  premier locomotives of the day it's the same thing in Libya same reason they've
[02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:40.160]  taken over Libya Gerald we are out of time I hope folks will visit your website

[02:24:08.800 --> 02:24:13.560]  all right Webster Tartley was recently in Libya is coming up I wanted Paul Watson
[02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:18.760]  to join us via video skype just briefly to give us a breakdown of an article I
[02:24:18.760 --> 02:24:24.360]  worked on with him this morning Obama hits struggling Americans with energy
[02:24:24.360 --> 02:24:31.400]  rate hikes this is a big deal dealing with agenda 21 and then segue into Libya
[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:37.080]  another article he did NATO hands terrorist who killed US troops control
[02:24:37.080 --> 02:24:43.840]  of Libya al Qaeda gets new home as rebels seize Tripoli I mean now that
[02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:49.480]  they've pretty much taken over and Gaddafi scurrying around somewhere now
[02:24:49.480 --> 02:24:52.400]  it's just gonna be an endless civil war which is exactly what they want Paul
[02:24:52.400 --> 02:24:59.560]  Watson well that's right Alex and I mean back in on July 8th I wrote an article
[02:24:59.560 --> 02:25:05.280]  and also I was on your show when Mike Adams was hosting it and the headline of
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:10.240]  the article was US wants Gaddafi toppled by September the United States and
[02:25:10.240 --> 02:25:14.400]  France set a deadline September 2nd to topple the Libyan leader Colonel
[02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:18.520]  Gaddafi and basically there at that time they were saying to him look if you
[02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:23.760]  don't step down now we're gonna launch a massive bombardment of NATO and we're
[02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:27.240]  gonna basically bomb you out of there and that's exactly what happened on
[02:25:27.240 --> 02:25:34.480]  Saturday and Sunday had NATO jets RAF fighters bombarded Tripoli and then
[02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:40.840]  al Qaeda rebels can now storm in and steal the 144 tons of gold and take over
[02:25:40.840 --> 02:25:46.280]  the country and basically turn it into an extremist backwater Libya of course
[02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:51.280]  because Gaddafi had spent most of the oil money on he'd reinvested it in the
[02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:55.840]  country was they had one of the highest living standards in the region now
[02:25:55.840 --> 02:25:59.360]  that's all gonna be eviscerated and I mean that's what that's why in the
[02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:03.880]  middle-class support Gaddafi in the first place because relatively in
[02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:07.560]  comparison to other countries in North Africa and the Middle East it's a good
[02:26:07.560 --> 02:26:12.600]  standard of living for those people in Libya in Tripoli in the major cities so
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:18.800]  now that's all eviscerated you've got a bomber and Cameron you know grandstanding
[02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:24.280]  at the glorious victory as if they commanded the the army themselves and
[02:26:24.280 --> 02:26:29.080]  basically it's gonna turn into another quagmire once those extremists get
[02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:33.520]  control it's gonna turn into another Iraq and of course the irony irony is
[02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:38.760]  that the very terrorists who killed US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan the same
[02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:46.000]  al Qaeda that was funded by MI5 in 1996 to assassinate Gaddafi is now gonna be
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:50.960]  firmly in control with globalist blessings in Libya well you again you're
[02:26:50.960 --> 02:26:55.440]  anti America anti England that you don't support al Qaeda would you like to
[02:26:55.440 --> 02:27:00.600]  apologize for not supporting the glorious al Qaeda well I'm just still
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:05.600]  surprised that those people that rioted and looted in the UK a couple weeks ago
[02:27:05.600 --> 02:27:10.360]  aren't the legitimate government because I thought that's how we do business now
[02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:15.280]  I mean they were called protesters remember back in March even as they
[02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:20.640]  seized military tanks and fighter jets the media called them protesters for
[02:27:20.640 --> 02:27:25.800]  three weeks just to give the UN time enough to craft this resolution which
[02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:31.040]  they instantly violated the no-fly zone turned into a bombardment overnight and
[02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:35.520]  then arming training funding the rebels again violating their own resolution
[02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:41.680]  and now we come to this operation mermaid dawn endgame and of course the
[02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:45.840]  establishment media is all joyous at these celebrations as if it's some
[02:27:45.840 --> 02:27:51.240]  organic uprising there was a massive sustained bombardment on Saturday and
[02:27:51.240 --> 02:27:57.720]  Sunday night some you know 1300 people dead 5,000 injured and that the media is
[02:27:57.720 --> 02:28:02.120]  treating it as if it's just some organic uprising no way now those planes bombs
[02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:06.880]  they were dropping killing people that was peace peace bombs from the peace
[02:28:06.880 --> 02:28:11.800]  laureate Barack Obama who has more troops deployed than George W. Bush did at
[02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:16.840]  any time in his presence with you Paul I mean working with al Qaeda and bombing
[02:28:16.840 --> 02:28:23.640]  killing civilians is peace it's kinetic action exactly well you're very you're
[02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:27.720]  very evil I mean look it's totally going to disintegrate into badlam which is
[02:28:27.720 --> 02:28:31.520]  order out of chaos that's what they want so now the rest of Africa will sink
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:35.320]  deeper into the murk what about the fact that the White House responded us in
[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:39.120]  February and now it's totally confirmed they're saying they're going to shut
[02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:42.760]  down most the power plants not owned by General Electric who's been given the
[02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:48.360]  waivers this article we've got out today is so important Paul it's important
[02:28:48.360 --> 02:28:52.120]  because it's not just the fact that they're hitting Americans with massive
[02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:56.960]  power bill rises you know right on the edge of a double-dip recession which is
[02:28:56.960 --> 02:29:01.520]  exactly what's happening in the UK double percentage point increases on your
[02:29:01.520 --> 02:29:05.200]  gas and electricity they made the same announcements your carbon taxes are set
[02:29:05.200 --> 02:29:10.360]  to double your prices yeah and it's it's not just hollowing out the American
[02:29:10.360 --> 02:29:15.800]  industry it's cap and trade via the back door because remember Obama tried to get
[02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:20.520]  it passed in Congress he failed and now he's going to these power companies
[02:29:20.520 --> 02:29:24.360]  through the APPA and saying you have to get these controls in place they can't
[02:29:24.360 --> 02:29:28.920]  do it so they're just having to purchase credit carbon credits from the other
[02:29:28.920 --> 02:29:32.520]  power companies that the pollution is still going out there but Al Gore
[02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:36.760]  Obama and the Ross Childs are still getting their carbon payments so
[02:29:36.760 --> 02:29:41.280]  everything's okay well that's good Al Qaeda isn't victorious that that's
[02:29:41.280 --> 02:29:45.840]  pro-america the only the insiders get to have power plants prices are going up
[02:29:45.840 --> 02:29:50.440]  that's good and so it's wonderful
[02:29:50.560 --> 02:29:57.560]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[02:32:58.600 --> 02:33:17.320]  we're going to be talking with Webster Griffin Tarpley who was recently in
[02:33:17.320 --> 02:33:22.840]  Tripoli under the bombardment reporting for MFullWars.com in a moment some of his
[02:33:22.840 --> 02:33:28.200]  colleagues that he knows have been wounded in the humanitarian bloodbath
[02:33:28.200 --> 02:33:34.160]  that is known as Nobel Peace and we're going to be looking at that and reports
[02:33:34.160 --> 02:33:40.520]  of a Qaddafi counterattack of fake dead Qaddafi photos drifting around this is
[02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:45.520]  quite the spectacle and the new model of how the UN will invade you they will
[02:33:45.520 --> 02:33:50.520]  fund terrorist to attack they will uprise if you fight back in any way you
[02:33:50.520 --> 02:33:57.440]  will be bombarded with kinetic love bombs and if you're not for Al Qaeda you're
[02:33:57.440 --> 02:34:03.440]  an American now I guess I'm an American then because it's admitted and we have
[02:34:03.440 --> 02:34:07.200]  the quotes here of the rebel leaders that they've killed Americans in Iraq
[02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:11.400]  and that they still hate America well then why would our government be doing
[02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:16.640]  this because they don't like stable countries they want to destabilize all
[02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:21.120]  of Africa even further so that's coming up with Webster Tarpoli Watson finishing
[02:34:21.120 --> 02:34:25.160]  up with your central article I've seen the articles in England in the London
[02:34:25.160 --> 02:34:29.320]  telegraph just a few weeks ago power prices set to double in the next three
[02:34:29.320 --> 02:34:34.760]  years and so they can't get the carbon tax that's paid to the Rothschild slash
[02:34:34.760 --> 02:34:39.440]  Rockefeller Al Gore I mean they openly own it carbon exchanges you go to them
[02:34:39.440 --> 02:34:43.680]  and pay them money I'm I'm burning coal I'll pay you money Al Gore and he goes
[02:34:43.680 --> 02:34:50.200]  good my son your family is taken out of purgatory I absolve you pay more money
[02:34:50.200 --> 02:34:54.880]  and we will get you the rest of your family out of hell itself oh thank you
[02:34:54.880 --> 02:34:59.800]  Al Gore oh great man bear pig but now they've already had rolling blackouts
[02:34:59.800 --> 02:35:06.520]  massive power increased cost and now in your article you've got all these major
[02:35:06.520 --> 02:35:09.640]  power companies that aren't part of the insider group you've got the Texas Power
[02:35:09.640 --> 02:35:13.880]  Commission the Texas Public Utility Commission saying get ready for huge
[02:35:13.880 --> 02:35:18.640]  blackouts and double the power prices the Fort Worth star telegrams reporting
[02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:23.880]  that and this will be more of a blessing with General Electric who's had a
[02:35:23.880 --> 02:35:28.120]  waiver since February running around giggling and laughing in front of
[02:35:28.120 --> 02:35:35.360]  everyone obviously increasing power output at their factories at their
[02:35:35.360 --> 02:35:40.360]  generating systems I mean this is totally mafia this is like saying you can
[02:35:40.360 --> 02:35:45.440]  only buy groceries from you know Obama's maybe they'll start a string of
[02:35:45.440 --> 02:35:48.960]  grocery stores I guess they kind of have done that with naft and gat with
[02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:55.800]  Walmart so finishing up Paul Watson from England well precisely I mean G gives
[02:35:55.800 --> 02:35:59.480]  Obama half a million dollars they get the waiver that's how it works that's
[02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:03.720]  how that's Chicago land for you but this this is tens of millions of profit
[02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:09.760]  conservatively over the next few years for a half mil well precisely I mean it
[02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:14.520]  it's it's over a hundred billion dollars just in the immediate cost that these
[02:36:14.520 --> 02:36:18.840]  power companies will have to pay and as I said before even if you believe that
[02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:22.200]  carbon dioxide and these other greenhouse gases that they're talking
[02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:26.560]  about you know deadly killers they're gonna be emitted anyway it's just the
[02:36:26.560 --> 02:36:30.960]  power companies are gonna buy the carbon credits from Al Gore the Rothschilds
[02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:36.040]  and Obama who is also invested in it and they're gonna pass the cost on to the
[02:36:36.040 --> 02:36:40.760]  consumers that's why our bills are going up 20% but the Rothschilds have yachts
[02:36:40.760 --> 02:36:45.440]  and private jets that put out a special gas that counteracts the devil carbon
[02:36:45.440 --> 02:36:49.800]  dioxide so you want to pray to them did you know that the Rothschilds flatulence
[02:36:49.800 --> 02:36:55.040]  is actually the only gas humans live off of well precisely and you know Ted
[02:36:55.040 --> 02:36:59.520]  Turner can have five kids Rockefeller can have six kids but overpopulations a
[02:36:59.520 --> 02:37:04.200]  problem we can't have any the thing is though I mean look at this UK faces
[02:37:04.200 --> 02:37:08.800]  green agenda backlash as energy prices rise for the for the moment they're
[02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:13.080]  going up 20% they'll go up more next year but that's also the amount that they
[02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:17.360]  spend on so-called green energy and this is the same in both countries and it
[02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:22.640]  mainly goes on wind turbines which are notoriously inefficient in northern
[02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:26.840]  Europe when we get cold weather like we did last winter you know coldest winter
[02:37:26.840 --> 02:37:31.560]  in a hundred years they don't work do you have to get really powerful winds for
[02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:35.720]  them to work and even then they're so much more expensive to run they always
[02:37:35.720 --> 02:37:39.400]  break you know birds are flying into them you can't maintain them because
[02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:43.320]  they're out in these isolated locations and all our money is being spent on this
[02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:48.700]  because they've got this commitment to generate 20% green energy I think it's
[02:37:48.700 --> 02:37:52.880]  wonderful the next 10 years I think it's totally reasonable that insiders get
[02:37:52.880 --> 02:37:57.920]  waivers from not having to buy health care on Obamacare and that General
[02:37:57.920 --> 02:38:02.480]  Electric gets a waiver that they wrote I mean they wrote it to shut down their
[02:38:02.480 --> 02:38:06.320]  competition I think that's fine and I think Al Qaeda taking over Libby is a
[02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:10.120]  wonderful thing and I just again I'm really ashamed that you're not for for
[02:38:10.120 --> 02:38:15.680]  Al Qaeda Paul well I guess that you know as long as we as long as we do pay our
[02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:19.920]  carbon credits at least the space aliens won't attack because that's what the
[02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:24.680]  NASA scientists told us last week space aliens are concerned about global
[02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:29.200]  if we don't line the pockets of Al Gore the first carbon billionaire you know
[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:33.440]  ET might come and get us so by the way Jaren actually when I talked about this
[02:38:33.440 --> 02:38:38.160]  yesterday did post the Guardian article a NASA funded scientist and this is the
[02:38:38.160 --> 02:38:43.160]  one in Guardian headline came out and said pay Al Gore the money or the aliens
[02:38:43.160 --> 02:38:47.400]  are gonna kill us I mean Paul next they're gonna say Freddie Kruger is
[02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:51.400]  coming if you don't pay Man Bear Pig and of course I joked about the flatulence
[02:38:51.400 --> 02:38:55.000]  of the Rothschilds they are now in Europe and it's starting in the US
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:39:00.120]  Canada already passed it the Cal flatulence tax and so they're saying
[02:39:00.120 --> 02:39:04.360]  that Cal's flatulence is gonna kill the earth even though the Earth's always been
[02:39:04.360 --> 02:39:10.560]  covered with with herbivores bovine creatures I mean you know they wiped
[02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:15.880]  out the tens of millions of buffalo and replaced it with a animal that can breed
[02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:21.240]  with it another type of domesticated cow that's I mean it's insane they say
[02:39:21.240 --> 02:39:26.800]  aliens are gonna get us Cal flatulence is evil pay Rothschild more money I mean
[02:39:26.800 --> 02:39:30.560]  you could not make up a joke this disgusting and this sick they're paying
[02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:37.080]  a sheep flatulence tax in Australia now and they're openly the New York Times of
[02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:41.560]  the headline three years ago attacks on breathing they're not playing games and
[02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:45.440]  there's all these weird goody-two-shoes running around who like get off on
[02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:50.160]  hating themselves and they want to pay a tax for breathing these are mentally ill
[02:39:50.160 --> 02:39:55.760]  people Paul oh yes save the planet kill yourself but these people are in power
[02:39:55.760 --> 02:39:59.640]  John Holdren's in control of the geoengineering and then you've got this
[02:39:59.640 --> 02:40:03.880]  Plandopolis agenda which is what the big oil companies and the British
[02:40:03.880 --> 02:40:07.640]  government put out a couple of years ago where they say if you want to drive a
[02:40:07.640 --> 02:40:10.560]  car you're gonna have to apply for permission from the government we're
[02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:14.720]  gonna have a global food council you're gonna get meat as a rare delicacy maybe
[02:40:14.720 --> 02:40:19.280]  want them one incidentally they've got trendies posing as patriots liberal
[02:40:19.280 --> 02:40:23.160]  filmmakers making movies about the same plastic cities we're all gonna have to go
[02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:29.200]  live in yeah and it's a it's a throwback to Maoist China even as recently as the
[02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:34.800]  80s people who lived in China poor people they meet was a rare delicacy once a
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:39.720]  month treats and in this Plandopolis slave opolis the people who resist are
[02:40:39.720 --> 02:40:44.120]  gonna be thrown in these cry freedom ghettos where they're segregated off
[02:40:44.120 --> 02:40:48.920]  from the rest of society that's not my terminology that's what they call them in
[02:40:48.920 --> 02:40:54.040]  their own video promoting this agenda so people need to realize that these people
[02:40:54.040 --> 02:40:59.240]  are in control they're insane and that you know they're holding the reins of
[02:40:59.240 --> 02:41:02.960]  power they're insane like a fox their low-level minions are mentally ill and
[02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:07.160]  just like a moth to flame enjoy the control freak authoritarianism and
[02:41:07.160 --> 02:41:10.920]  believe that they're gonna be part of it because they've given themselves to it
[02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:15.320]  you know that's your average general loser but on top they're cold-blooded they
[02:41:15.320 --> 02:41:18.880]  say how do we sell slavery and make folks love it we teach people how to help
[02:41:18.880 --> 02:41:23.480]  themselves and then have a new green Nazism sold while they fly around in
[02:41:23.480 --> 02:41:26.600]  their private jets Paul Watson will continue to track these articles as
[02:41:26.600 --> 02:41:31.120]  they unfold the White House responded to us in February everybody needs to get
[02:41:31.120 --> 02:41:36.040]  this article out Obama hit struggling Americans with energy rate hikes thank
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:40.600]  you so much Paul Watson thanks Alex all right Webster Griffin Tarpley who
[02:41:40.600 --> 02:41:44.720]  bravely spent several weeks in Libya a little over a month ago and reported to
[02:41:44.720 --> 02:41:50.080]  us live under the peaceful kinetic military bombardment that's killed
[02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:53.680]  thousands and thousands of people but I'm politically correct it is peaceful
[02:41:53.680 --> 02:41:58.440]  and non-military because they said so now it's confirmed Al Qaeda are the
[02:41:58.440 --> 02:42:03.240]  leaders headline NATO hence terrorists who killed US troops control over Libya
[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:08.840]  Al Qaeda gets new home as rebels sees triply what is the stratagem here what's
[02:42:08.840 --> 02:42:13.080]  the latest that Webster Griffin Tarpley has he also reported to me that one of
[02:42:13.080 --> 02:42:22.080]  his colleagues Dr. Franklin Lamb shot in triply by NATO Al Qaeda peace activist
[02:42:22.080 --> 02:42:26.920]  Webster Tarpley tell us more about the peace that's reportedly killed thousands
[02:42:26.920 --> 02:42:30.720]  in the last 24 hours well what we're dealing with here is a carefully
[02:42:30.720 --> 02:42:35.360]  cynically planned military operation by the NATO high command with the US
[02:42:35.360 --> 02:42:38.960]  playing a very very important role in it don't listen to anything to the
[02:42:38.960 --> 02:42:44.280]  contrary it is called operation mermaid dawn and in the middle of that you've
[02:42:44.280 --> 02:42:49.680]  also got something called operation mermaid or operation siren similar
[02:42:49.680 --> 02:42:55.360]  terms coming maybe from the French but this is a military operation and it's
[02:42:55.360 --> 02:43:00.240]  basically this they're facing the mid-september deadline when the United
[02:43:00.240 --> 02:43:05.520]  Nations Security Council resolution runs out and without that resolution it's
[02:43:05.520 --> 02:43:11.000]  very hard for Italy and Canada and a bunch of smaller NATO countries to play
[02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:15.480]  a role and since the main bases have to be in Italy because of the geography
[02:43:15.480 --> 02:43:22.120]  there's a hysterical attempt in in NATO to put an end to this now what they've
[02:43:22.120 --> 02:43:26.880]  done is first of all carpet bombing instead of
[02:43:26.880 --> 02:43:32.720]  thought crime love bombing yeah right carpet bombing carpet bombing of
[02:43:32.720 --> 02:43:37.280]  civilians no concern for civilian casualties just a mad dash to get it
[02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:42.240]  all over with so very very heavy bombing of Tripoli and of the approaches to
[02:43:42.240 --> 02:43:47.960]  Tripoli in the past week or so and in addition a very aggressive use of these
[02:43:47.960 --> 02:43:53.760]  Apache helicopters with a lot of strafing of civilians with machine guns
[02:43:53.760 --> 02:43:59.560]  especially in some rockets and this this is accounted for something upwards of
[02:43:59.560 --> 02:44:07.360]  1300 dead civilians in the past 48 hours let's say 1300 dead as of yesterday and
[02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:12.360]  then many more overnight so this is this is the protection of civilians under
[02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:17.160]  the UN Security Council resolution so carpet bombing Apache helicopters that
[02:44:17.160 --> 02:44:21.520]  accounts for the rapid progress of the rebels now the other thing that accounts
[02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:28.040]  for it is amphibious landings all reports now agree that smaller landing
[02:44:28.040 --> 02:44:33.760]  craft as well as larger NATO warships cruised up very close to the coast there
[02:44:33.760 --> 02:44:38.360]  to the port of Tripoli on the Mediterranean and landed these death
[02:44:38.360 --> 02:44:44.080]  squads these terror teams of al-Qaeda killers who had been shipped in from
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:49.680]  Benghazi and Tobruk and and Durna and places like this so this I think
[02:44:49.680 --> 02:44:54.160]  let me look we're pro-america here on this show so don't don't criticize the
[02:44:54.160 --> 02:44:58.360]  valley and al-Qaeda forces right by the way they're they're banning first
[02:44:58.360 --> 02:45:03.040]  responders from the 9-11 remembrance events so the 9-11 responders are bad
[02:45:03.040 --> 02:45:06.680]  al-Qaeda is good I'm gonna have to have you apologize for talking about about
[02:45:06.680 --> 02:45:12.480]  al-Qaeda we're gonna have to let you go okay so the this I think accounts for
[02:45:12.480 --> 02:45:16.160]  this it's it's like it's what you call it more for a coup de main in other words
[02:45:16.160 --> 02:45:20.920]  they've they've taken some key parts of the of the city however the reports I'm
[02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:24.200]  getting and these come from Franklin lamb that you mentioned wounded though he
[02:45:24.200 --> 02:45:29.320]  is he continues to report Lizzie Phelan who has been in the rick sose hotel and
[02:45:29.320 --> 02:45:35.680]  Darius Mahdi Nazem Rolaia you can see a lot of this on Russia today they
[02:45:35.680 --> 02:45:40.480]  continued to report during the night and especially Franklin lamb is up in a in
[02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:45.200]  a high-rise hotel and he can see the approaches coming into Tripoli from the
[02:45:45.200 --> 02:45:51.000]  from the west so what we've got is reports of a counterattack being
[02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:56.600]  organized by the Gaddafi forces starting from the Gaddafi compound with heavy
[02:45:56.600 --> 02:46:02.200]  fighting going on there tanks under Gaddafi and his supporters moving
[02:46:02.200 --> 02:46:07.360]  towards green square we're even told that the rebels have lost control at
[02:46:07.360 --> 02:46:12.520]  least temporarily did lose control of green square when a column of Gaddafi
[02:46:12.520 --> 02:46:17.000]  forces went through there the counterattack seems to be under the
[02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:23.800]  command of Thomas Gaddafi K-H-A-M-I-S that's the one son who has not been
[02:46:23.800 --> 02:46:29.720]  captured three other sons captured one son killed months ago the other thing
[02:46:29.720 --> 02:46:34.200]  we have is from Franklin lamb in his vantage point in this high-rise hotel
[02:46:34.200 --> 02:46:41.720]  he says that he saw a convoy of 25 pro-gaddafi military trucks going
[02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:48.800]  towards the center of the city so this I don't think is over and there's some
[02:46:48.800 --> 02:46:53.240]  indications that there was actually a strategy I would say the Gaddafi forces
[02:46:53.240 --> 02:46:57.880]  were taken by surprise by the amphibious landings this may be accounts for why
[02:46:57.880 --> 02:47:02.280]  they didn't use their anti ship missiles which they are known to have by the way
[02:47:02.280 --> 02:47:08.320]  my sources say US NATO and private contractors were inserted two days ago
[02:47:08.320 --> 02:47:13.280]  from the sea it's probably not just the valiant al-qaeda people yes well the
[02:47:13.280 --> 02:47:18.040]  report that I have if you if you look look at toply.net I've got the the
[02:47:18.040 --> 02:47:22.520]  report is that from May saw that the al-qaeda fighters from Benghazi that
[02:47:22.520 --> 02:47:27.360]  were landed by NATO were under the control of NATO officers so European
[02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:32.280]  officers which reproduces the eternal pattern of the colonial army just with
[02:47:32.280 --> 02:47:37.240]  the Libyans that thought that they'd they'd gotten rid of so heavy fighting I
[02:47:37.240 --> 02:47:41.680]  think goes on there is a humanitarian emergency in particular I would mention
[02:47:41.680 --> 02:47:46.720]  that the people in this rickso's hotel the international reporters these are
[02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:50.920]  international reporters who are basically anti-nato they don't agree with this
[02:47:50.920 --> 02:47:55.360]  DIA line and that would that would be makhty daria snazum rohaya that you can
[02:47:55.360 --> 02:48:00.800]  see on Russia today Franklin Lamb is in a different hotel and Terime so is also
[02:48:00.800 --> 02:48:05.600]  still in the city I would also point out there seems to be a danger to the life
[02:48:05.600 --> 02:48:10.680]  of Musa Ibrahim who is the spokesperson of the regime as well as his wife and
[02:48:10.680 --> 02:48:15.160]  his son the rebels are telling people on on YouTube that they're going to
[02:48:15.160 --> 02:48:19.520]  exact a terrible fate now you can yeah that's peace to the killing women and
[02:48:19.520 --> 02:48:22.280]  children you know that's that's what the good guys do right not going to
[02:48:22.280 --> 02:48:26.760]  criticize torture on this show are you that we could we I think we can we can
[02:48:26.760 --> 02:48:30.640]  simply you know if you want to start to take a case study of the human rights
[02:48:30.640 --> 02:48:34.800]  record of these Benghazi rebels see what happens to Musa Ibrahim and his family
[02:48:34.800 --> 02:48:39.600]  that will tell you everything now in terms of what's going to happen now
[02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:46.480]  Gaddafi if Gaddafi can can maintain some kind of a of a position in the in the
[02:48:46.480 --> 02:48:50.040]  capital or nearby that's that's a very different scenario from what the
[02:48:50.040 --> 02:48:55.600]  television is telling you if Gaddafi is decisively defeated in the Tripoli area
[02:48:55.600 --> 02:49:01.600]  he would probably be well advised to to take the example of Mubarak and go to
[02:49:01.600 --> 02:49:07.640]  some friendly place and perhaps lay low for a while and wait for the inevitable
[02:49:07.640 --> 02:49:11.160]  civil war among these thieves because these are thieves who are going to fall
[02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:14.480]  out you can already they've been constantly killing each other and
[02:49:14.480 --> 02:49:18.400]  calling in airstrikes on each other that's admitted exactly so that would be
[02:49:18.400 --> 02:49:23.840]  this Khalifa hipster the top CIA guy is Khalifa hipster but of course he lived
[02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:28.480]  in Virginia he lived here by between the Pentagon and the CIA for 20 years and
[02:49:28.480 --> 02:49:32.560]  they're going to be factional differences between him and say a bunch of
[02:49:32.560 --> 02:49:38.920]  guys like the ones who were in Darna who had been fighting the US in Iraq and
[02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:42.600]  Afghanistan I don't see how they're gonna get along very well you've also got
[02:49:42.600 --> 02:49:49.360]  Chalil who is the the presentable face and Jibril these people have really no
[02:49:49.360 --> 02:49:53.920]  mass support they're there to have a presentable face that they can send to
[02:49:53.920 --> 02:49:59.240]  the United Nations and so forth so I would expect a bloody civil war to break
[02:49:59.240 --> 02:50:04.840]  out among the rebel factions quite soon and especially we've got this 70 page
[02:50:04.840 --> 02:50:09.960]  report of what the occupation is going to look like the occupation calls for
[02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:16.200]  tens of thousands of troops from the United Arab Emirates Emirates now those
[02:50:16.200 --> 02:50:20.720]  guys are royalists their reactionaries in all of their social policies whereas
[02:50:20.720 --> 02:50:26.120]  Gaddafi is one of the most progressive socially oriented people like all the
[02:50:26.120 --> 02:50:31.440]  oil money was used or to logic set for for health care for they're gonna send
[02:50:31.440 --> 02:50:35.120]  in foreigners to help make sure all the money is stolen and to enforce
[02:50:35.120 --> 02:50:40.880]  privatization deregulation the race to the bottom the usual IMF shock therapy
[02:50:40.880 --> 02:50:45.800]  agenda but if the foreign troops come in even if they're so-called Arabs from the
[02:50:45.800 --> 02:50:51.240]  United Arab Emirates or even worse Qatar the the people there in Doha that will
[02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:55.640]  lead to a civil war I think in short order so my my advice stay there so
[02:50:55.640 --> 02:51:01.680]  basically absolute humanitarian disaster in the name of stopping what
[02:51:01.680 --> 02:51:05.400]  you're about to hear are the real experiences of women over 40 who finally
[02:51:05.400 --> 02:51:09.720]  lost weight by becoming hormonally balanced again I lost 20 pounds I lost
[02:51:09.720 --> 02:51:17.000]  40 pounds I lost 55 pounds I went from a size 14 to a size 8 their secret is
[02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:21.920]  amber in the revolutionary formula for women over 40 that balances hormones
[02:51:21.920 --> 02:51:26.640]  naturally the leading cause of weight gain over 40 is hormonal imbalance
[02:51:26.640 --> 02:51:31.040]  until you balance your hormones losing weight can be practically impossible but
[02:51:31.040 --> 02:51:35.200]  amber in restores hormonal balance naturally so the weight can just fall
[02:51:35.200 --> 02:51:40.000]  right off even that stubborn belly fat plus amber in eliminates other symptoms
[02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:44.520]  of hormonal aging like hot flashes night sweats low libido difficulty
[02:51:44.520 --> 02:51:48.480]  concentrating and more be one of the first 50 callers right now and they'll

[02:54:03.080 --> 02:54:08.640]  Webster Griffin Tarpley is our guest I've seen three polls out this weekend
[02:54:08.640 --> 02:54:13.920]  where Ron Paul is number one the Drudge Report at DrudgeReport.com we're also
[02:54:13.920 --> 02:54:18.360]  posting this at infowars.com has the headline that Ron Paul is evenly
[02:54:18.360 --> 02:54:24.080]  matched against Obama he's neck and neck with Obama there it is Gallup Obama
[02:54:24.080 --> 02:54:28.920]  closely matched against Paul and Bachman so as I keep telling you because I'm not
[02:54:28.920 --> 02:54:33.520]  just cheerleading here and saying Ron Paul can win you know three and a half
[02:54:33.520 --> 02:54:38.600]  years ago I was just pointing out he's an underdog but he should win now if you
[02:54:38.600 --> 02:54:41.760]  look at all the hundreds of polls I've seen different straw polls he's number
[02:54:41.760 --> 02:54:47.080]  one number two or number three now that is a front runner that's with them
[02:54:47.080 --> 02:54:52.960]  ignoring him or demonizing him so they're definitely scared of Ron Paul
[02:54:52.960 --> 02:54:57.800]  now shifting years back to Webster Griffin Tarpley of Tarpley.net Webster
[02:54:57.800 --> 02:55:02.360]  anyway you slice and I'm not a fan of Gaddafi but compared to Al Qaeda there
[02:55:02.360 --> 02:55:06.760]  is such a thing as lesser of two evils and he wasn't a total pig I mean he did
[02:55:06.760 --> 02:55:11.160]  build up the country and the rest of Africa and we know it means civil war
[02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:18.680]  death destruction of a comparative jewel in the region and this is the same
[02:55:18.680 --> 02:55:22.680]  reason they took down Serbia again not a fan of Miloževic or any of those guys
[02:55:22.680 --> 02:55:29.040]  but at the end of the day why did NATO do this? Well on the one hand Gaddafi
[02:55:29.040 --> 02:55:33.760]  represents an ideological threat because of this Arab socialism which he
[02:55:33.760 --> 02:55:39.840]  actually practiced Libya probably has the best record of any oil-producing
[02:55:39.840 --> 02:55:44.720]  country in terms of reinvesting that in social development they this was the
[02:55:44.720 --> 02:55:49.640]  top country on the United Nations human development index for Africa and they
[02:55:49.640 --> 02:55:54.440]  were at 57 in the world which meant that they were beating Russia beating
[02:55:54.440 --> 02:55:58.960]  Ukraine beating Brazil and it's remarkable because they had started so
[02:55:58.960 --> 02:56:04.520]  near rock bottom they were absolute basically nomads until about when I'm
[02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:10.440]  1965 1970 when when Gaddafi came in we remember you've got that great man made
[02:56:10.440 --> 02:56:13.360]  river which means that they're gonna have a quarter for the next couple of
[02:56:13.360 --> 02:56:18.680]  hundred years unless NATO has bombed it in the meantime and that you know
[02:56:18.680 --> 02:56:22.040]  health care was for free housing allowances were given these are the
[02:56:22.040 --> 02:56:26.640]  things that NATO hates so they want to go in there now and privatize all that
[02:56:26.640 --> 02:56:30.560]  and they had been the weakening of Gaddafi is due to the fact that there
[02:56:30.560 --> 02:56:35.720]  was a first privatization offensive in 2003 when they demanded the partial
[02:56:35.720 --> 02:56:39.800]  privatization is certain of the oil and because he was he was under the gun of
[02:56:39.800 --> 02:56:43.880]  what Bush had just done in Iraq he felt that he had to make concession then
[02:56:43.880 --> 02:56:47.760]  unfortunately that even reached up into his into his family and now it's
[02:56:47.760 --> 02:56:51.640]  admitted that the 70 plus billion in banks is being stolen the tens of
[02:56:51.640 --> 02:56:56.400]  billions in gold is now going to disappear and stolen from the people of
[02:56:56.400 --> 02:57:01.920]  Libya I mean this is just so outrageous right that the the frozen assets that
[02:57:01.920 --> 02:57:06.200]  the State Department has got custody of now the US part I don't know how many
[02:57:06.200 --> 02:57:09.640]  billion there are but there are there are quite a few billion that's gonna go
[02:57:09.640 --> 02:57:16.640]  into the Swiss bank accounts of these pacemen like Jaleel Jabriel Hifter the
[02:57:16.640 --> 02:57:20.200]  people who are running that Benghazi rebel council and none of that will
[02:57:20.200 --> 02:57:24.600]  ever be seen as humanitarian aid this is gonna be a kleptocracy beyond your
[02:57:24.600 --> 02:57:29.520]  wild that's my next issue are they gonna use Libya as their new al-Qaeda base to
[02:57:29.520 --> 02:57:34.240]  then menace the West yeah you can imagine al-Qaeda piracy in the
[02:57:34.240 --> 02:57:38.480]  Mediterranean no it's funny and if you go back to American history in the
[02:57:38.480 --> 02:57:43.600]  early 1800s Thomas Jefferson the big concern was the the bobby pirates right
[02:57:43.600 --> 02:57:47.600]  Stephen Decatur and all this so it meant that these these these ports in North
[02:57:47.600 --> 02:57:53.100]  Africa were the bases of pirates and the pirates of course worked with the
[02:57:53.100 --> 02:57:56.920]  British because the British bought protection others couldn't the US
[02:57:56.920 --> 02:58:00.880]  couldn't and didn't and therefore had to wage these wars today you've got the
[02:58:00.880 --> 02:58:06.920]  US intervening in a place like Libya to reestablish piracy but this time under
[02:58:06.920 --> 02:58:12.360]  al-Qaeda auspices so this is gonna have a big effect on the entire Mediterranean
[02:58:12.360 --> 02:58:17.240]  literal from Spain to Italy to Greece all the way across this is now going to
[02:58:17.240 --> 02:58:22.440]  fundamentally change what the Mediterranean looks like and again it's
[02:58:22.440 --> 02:58:26.720]  going to be an open sore if you didn't want al-Qaeda to have a sanctuary if
[02:58:26.720 --> 02:58:30.640]  that was the point of Afghanistan they have just been given a sanctuary or at
[02:58:30.640 --> 02:58:34.520]  least it's our webster stay there let's do five Europe let's do five more minutes

[02:59:51.520 --> 02:59:57.520]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[02:59:57.520 --> 03:00:15.960]  Broadcasting Network okay folks we're in a little overdrive here at prison planet
[03:00:15.960 --> 03:00:20.040]  dot TV with Webster Tarpley Webster was bringing up the fact that reporters are
[03:00:20.040 --> 03:00:24.400]  being shot a lot of things are happening and Russia today has gone with the
[03:00:24.400 --> 03:00:28.800]  story that a CNN reporter threatened one of their reporters and said you'll be
[03:00:28.800 --> 03:00:32.440]  lucky to basically get out of here alive he interpreted that as a death threat
[03:00:32.440 --> 03:00:38.600]  Webster tell us about that this is Maki Darius Nazem Rolaia and he's he's a guy
[03:00:38.600 --> 03:00:41.880]  that that Russia today had been interviewing basically every hour
[03:00:41.880 --> 03:00:47.240]  during the night now between Sunday and Monday and some of these reports were
[03:00:47.240 --> 03:00:50.360]  very dramatic because he'd be sitting there and he said the security has
[03:00:50.360 --> 03:00:55.800]  disappeared and there you can hear gunfire outside there was snipers outside
[03:00:55.800 --> 03:01:01.520]  of the hotel he tried to go out and put up placards saying press TV don't shoot
[03:01:01.520 --> 03:01:07.520]  and snipers were shooting at him as he was trying to put up these placards and
[03:01:07.520 --> 03:01:10.240]  during the night you could see him walking around the corridors of this
[03:01:10.240 --> 03:01:15.600]  hotel very eerie but he says now this is Darius Maki Nazem Rolaia says on
[03:01:15.600 --> 03:01:21.840]  Russia today that the CNN correspondent or one of them came to him and conveyed
[03:01:21.840 --> 03:01:26.880]  what he interpreted as something threatening which was I I'm surprised
[03:01:26.880 --> 03:01:32.040]  you're still putting out anti-nato news you know that could be very dangerous so
[03:01:32.040 --> 03:01:36.560]  this I think can be interpreted quite easily and of course this is in the
[03:01:36.560 --> 03:01:42.960]  context of Franklin Lam having been shot at the pool of a different hotel the
[03:01:42.960 --> 03:01:47.320]  first incident is at the Rixos the second one is at a hotel I call it the
[03:01:47.320 --> 03:01:51.840]  Radisson it's the 26th story but I think it used to be called the Carinthia and
[03:01:51.840 --> 03:01:57.760]  that's what everybody calls it there anyway he was walking by the pool if a
[03:01:57.760 --> 03:02:03.200]  funny story he had a bicycle and he was out riding around Tripoli to see what
[03:02:03.200 --> 03:02:07.920]  the story was yesterday morning Sunday morning he did fine and he found no
[03:02:07.920 --> 03:02:13.320]  particular evidence of rebel forces he gets back to the hotel he puts the
[03:02:13.320 --> 03:02:17.520]  bicycle aside and he walks by the pool and he thinks he was shot by a sniper
[03:02:17.520 --> 03:02:24.440]  out of the abandoned Marriott Hotel nearby so that would seem to have been
[03:02:24.440 --> 03:02:27.920]  pretty much planned I have to say Franklin when I was there I saw him
[03:02:27.920 --> 03:02:32.160]  repeatedly he would go to the pool spend an hour there every day and then
[03:02:32.160 --> 03:02:37.440]  you've got there's a there's a written report from Thierry Maison of France that
[03:02:37.440 --> 03:02:42.040]  Franklin Franklin Lam is from the US Nazem Roli from Canada Maison from
[03:02:42.040 --> 03:02:46.320]  France and he put out a basically a summary of what had happened by the way
[03:02:46.320 --> 03:02:50.840]  he's a very well-respected reporter in France yes and he's he's somebody who
[03:02:50.840 --> 03:02:55.080]  has lived in the Middle East I mean he's felt he felt obliged to live in the
[03:02:55.080 --> 03:03:00.240]  Middle East since Sarkozy has come in because it was getting too dangerous to
[03:03:00.240 --> 03:03:05.840]  be to be in France and that seems to be the trend anyway well there's no doubt
[03:03:05.840 --> 03:03:09.320]  the tyrants have gone into overdrive they're trying to bring down Syria right
[03:03:09.320 --> 03:03:15.360]  now too yes now I think this is going to be a totally different thing the merit
[03:03:15.360 --> 03:03:20.400]  of Gaddafi I think Gaddafi has many merits in terms there's no need to
[03:03:20.400 --> 03:03:25.760]  apologize for Gaddafi compared to most of the people in the US Empire this is
[03:03:25.760 --> 03:03:31.320]  clearly many cuts above but the real merit of Gaddafi lately has been that
[03:03:31.320 --> 03:03:35.800]  he blocked this process of the color revolutions remember they said we got
[03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:41.640]  Ben Ali of Tunisia we overthrew in in January and then we overthrew Mubarak
[03:03:41.640 --> 03:03:45.520]  of Egypt in February and they really thought they could overthrow Gaddafi in
[03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:50.320]  March and now it's August and he is still fighting he's still in the field and
[03:03:50.320 --> 03:03:54.800]  who knows how long it will last and what the outcome will be I wouldn't want to
[03:03:54.800 --> 03:03:59.720]  guess the Libya has not been time to invaders you can go back to Lukens
[03:03:59.720 --> 03:04:03.600]  Farsali I understand that I've claimed he's fallen five or six times previous
[03:04:03.600 --> 03:04:08.760]  but it looks like this could be it and then the loved peaceful civil war can
[03:04:08.760 --> 03:04:12.000]  then start and really get some deindustrialization going to the Civil
[03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:15.560]  War I mean that's that's what it has been but the effect of Gaddafi's
[03:04:15.560 --> 03:04:19.340]  resistance has been that the entire timetable was slowed down I mean they
[03:04:19.340 --> 03:04:24.720]  wanted Gaddafi gone in March Assad gone in in April or May and then they'd
[03:04:24.720 --> 03:04:28.880]  be on to Algeria by now and they might even get around to the monarchies
[03:04:28.880 --> 03:04:33.560]  right Morocco and Jordan and Saudi Arabia are certainly also on the same list if
[03:04:33.560 --> 03:04:37.720]  they can be intimidated fine if not they're going to be overthrown so
[03:04:37.720 --> 03:04:42.400]  Gaddafi has more or less put on the brakes and floated or practically stopped
[03:04:42.400 --> 03:04:47.040]  it for six months and that's a merit all right we'll have to follow this more
[03:04:47.040 --> 03:04:51.360]  Webster as it unfolds pray for peace over there and I don't mean the type that
[03:04:51.360 --> 03:04:55.760]  comes with 2,000 pound bombs if you want to look at my Twitter feed you find
[03:04:55.760 --> 03:04:59.600]  the numbers to the state department absolutely Webster we're out of time
[03:04:59.600 --> 03:05:24.560]  shiver buddy back tomorrow live
