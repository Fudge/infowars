[00:00.000 --> 00:04.420]  For a long time now, there's been too much secrecy in this city.
[00:04.420 --> 00:08.720]  The old rules said that if there was a defensible argument for not disclosing something to the
[00:08.720 --> 00:12.380]  American people, then it should not be disclosed.
[00:12.380 --> 00:14.160]  That era is now over.
[00:14.160 --> 00:19.500]  Remember when President Obama claimed that his administration would be the most transparent
[00:19.500 --> 00:20.500]  in history?
[00:20.500 --> 00:26.140]  We have put in place the toughest ethics laws and toughest transparency rules of any administration
[00:26.140 --> 00:27.140]  in history.
[00:27.140 --> 00:36.600]  Fast forward to today, Obama's administration will go down as the least transparent in American
[00:36.600 --> 00:37.600]  history.
[00:37.600 --> 00:43.560]  Denying access to FOIA requests, censoring government files, and as the AP reports a
[00:43.560 --> 00:49.520]  mountain of claims that the Obama administration couldn't find the requested documents on well
[00:49.520 --> 00:52.120]  over 215,000 occasions.
[00:52.120 --> 00:56.040]  The Obama administration isn't just non-transparent.
[00:56.040 --> 01:02.240]  It is also blatantly criminal, acknowledging that within nearly one in three cases, that
[01:02.240 --> 01:07.880]  its initial decisions to withhold or censor records were improper under the law, but only
[01:07.880 --> 01:09.560]  when it was challenged.
[01:09.560 --> 01:14.240]  And under that umbrella of deceit, a Goliath spy state has grown.
[01:14.240 --> 01:18.760]  It may appear that Obama is a lame duck president, but while we were distracted with the erosion
[01:18.760 --> 01:24.760]  of our national security, President Obama recently penned a memo to ramp up an expansion
[01:24.760 --> 01:30.200]  of the sharing network of intercepted data of American citizens by the NSA.
[01:30.200 --> 01:34.720]  Last month, President Obama released his fiscal 2016 budget request.
[01:34.720 --> 01:40.760]  Of course, the transparency concerning billions of dollars requested for the giant tax dollar
[01:40.760 --> 01:45.160]  sucking tick feeding on our Bill of Rights was missing.
[01:45.160 --> 01:47.320]  U.S. News & World Report wrote,
[01:47.320 --> 01:53.120]  Representative Peter Welch, a Democrat from Vermont, said of Obama's black budget omission,
[01:53.120 --> 01:59.360]  the top-line intelligent budgets for 16 federal agencies are unknown to the American taxpayer
[01:59.360 --> 02:05.120]  and largely unknown to most members of Congress, in spite of the strong recommendation by the
[02:05.120 --> 02:07.920]  9-11 Commission that they be disclosed.
[02:07.920 --> 02:13.120]  The Office of the Director of National Intelligence disclosed the administration's aggregate non-military
[02:13.120 --> 02:23.040]  intelligence spending request as $53.9 billion, up from $50.4 billion for fiscal year 2015.
[02:23.040 --> 02:27.780]  And of course, all those billions are doing very little to stop terror.
[02:27.780 --> 02:34.680]  As yet, once again, Heretz reports that Belgian intelligence had a precise warning of the
[02:34.680 --> 02:37.160]  recent airport and subway attacks.
[02:37.160 --> 02:42.400]  But rather than protect our freedoms as a result of the Brussels-Belgium bombings, the
[02:42.400 --> 02:48.760]  TSA is incrementally expanding outside of the airport into all forms of mass transit.
[02:48.760 --> 02:53.720]  As a blanketed police state of Viper teams become the new norm at train stations, bus
[02:53.720 --> 02:55.440]  stations and sporting events.
[02:55.440 --> 03:02.240]  Well, if the TSA is preparing to launch a specialized group, a specialized unit at airports
[03:02.240 --> 03:07.600]  in major cities in so-called Viper teams, they use everything from bomb-sniffing dogs
[03:07.600 --> 03:10.640]  to advanced specialized screening.
[03:10.640 --> 03:14.960]  And although the federal government says there is no threat, when you look at the procedures
[03:14.960 --> 03:20.040]  we're seeing across the nation, it is clear that the attacks overseas has stoked increased
[03:20.040 --> 03:23.400]  concerns over the U.S. transit system.
[03:23.400 --> 03:29.200]  Ushering in random bag checks and drug-sniffing dogs to become commonplace occurrences, you
[03:29.200 --> 03:33.120]  may say, what else are we supposed to do?
[03:33.120 --> 03:36.200]  Terrorist events are spiraling out of control.
[03:36.200 --> 03:41.200]  But if you pull back the curtain, it's clear that it is the entire New World Order system
[03:41.200 --> 03:43.800]  that is spiraling out of control.
[03:43.800 --> 03:46.200]  This really happened.
[03:46.200 --> 03:52.840]  This executive order, 12,425, gives complete and total diplomatic immunity to all members
[03:52.840 --> 03:55.180]  or designated agents of Interpol.
[03:55.180 --> 04:00.120]  This big private police consortium out of Europe, now global, one of the dirtiest police organizations
[04:00.120 --> 04:04.520]  on the planet, hooked in with just drug-running, child kidnapping.
[04:04.520 --> 04:07.240]  You can pull up all the mainstream news articles about it.
[04:07.240 --> 04:12.960]  And they are to have total diplomatic immunity, something police, military, FBI don't have
[04:12.960 --> 04:14.400]  and they shouldn't have.
[04:14.400 --> 04:19.040]  But worse than that, then the FBI, if they act through Interpol, they do get it.
[04:19.040 --> 04:20.040]  And then here's FEMA.
[04:20.040 --> 04:27.080]  This is a FEMA press release in LA09 held back in July with troops from 14 different
[04:27.080 --> 04:30.560]  countries to, quote, take on American domestic terrorists.
[04:30.560 --> 04:37.960]  So, I mean, the Army War College teaches they're going to use foreign assets in America.
[04:37.960 --> 04:42.000]  I mean, they're actually getting the police and military ready through the Threat Fusion
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.600]  Integration Centers for foreign troops.
[04:45.600 --> 04:48.120]  Groups like ISIL can't destroy us.
[04:48.120 --> 04:49.120]  They can't defeat us.
[04:49.120 --> 04:50.240]  They don't produce anything.
[04:50.240 --> 04:54.480]  They're not an existential threat to us.
[04:54.480 --> 04:59.720]  Once your mind is enslaved, imprisoning your body is a simple task.
[04:59.720 --> 05:06.360]  Ted Cruz ignores the real source of radical Islam, and that is the special relationship
[05:06.360 --> 05:09.680]  between the United States and Saudi Arabia.
[05:09.680 --> 05:15.640]  After candidate Ted Cruz sidestepped his proposal to patrol Muslim neighborhoods during an interview
[05:15.640 --> 05:16.640]  with CNN.
[05:16.640 --> 05:20.480]  If you have a neighborhood where there is a high level of gang activity, the way to
[05:20.480 --> 05:25.280]  prevent it is you increase the law enforcement presence there and you target the gang members
[05:25.280 --> 05:26.680]  to get them off the street.
[05:26.680 --> 05:31.680]  I am talking about any area where there is a higher incidence of radical Islamic terrorism.
[05:31.680 --> 05:34.680]  Cruz completely sidestepped the real issue.
[05:34.680 --> 05:40.360]  That is the creation, promotion, and support of radical Islamic terrorists by Saudi Arabia
[05:40.360 --> 05:41.800]  and the United States.
[05:41.800 --> 05:47.800]  As a political opportunist supported by Goldman Sachs, the CFR, and the establishment, Cruz
[05:47.800 --> 05:54.680]  must embrace the terror war narrative and its lies, delusions, emissions, and misrepresentations
[05:54.680 --> 05:55.680]  of the truth.

[08:20.040 --> 08:29.320]  Obama has really been enjoying his Cuban and Central and South American tour at a state
[08:29.320 --> 08:30.840]  dinner in Buenos Aires.
[08:30.840 --> 08:37.840]  He's out there dancing with the legendarily lovely ladies showing off his tango moves.
[08:37.840 --> 08:40.480]  So it's okay the NSA spying on you illegally.
[08:40.480 --> 08:43.240]  It's okay he's funding ISIS and al-Qaeda.
[08:43.240 --> 08:49.800]  It's okay that he sold us out for tens of trillions more in derivatives and banker bailouts.
[08:49.800 --> 08:57.880]  It's okay that our country is teetering towards total collapse because you turn on any late
[08:57.880 --> 09:07.240]  night comedy show, you turn on ESPN, you turn on HBO, almost any entertainment film I try
[09:07.240 --> 09:13.800]  to watch or any time I'm surfing through cable late at night maybe once or twice a week to
[09:13.800 --> 09:16.080]  eat a bowl of ice cream and watch a movie.
[09:16.080 --> 09:21.680]  I am assailed by Barack Obama in entertainment.
[09:21.680 --> 09:22.840]  That is unprecedented.
[09:22.840 --> 09:32.480]  That is what Edward Bernays 100 years ago called for a fusion of Hollywood with entertainment
[09:32.480 --> 09:37.040]  and the political class so that no one could tell the difference.
[09:37.040 --> 09:41.080]  That's when royalty began to behave like they were the new movie stars as well.
[09:41.080 --> 09:46.720]  Full advised by the man who created the Department of Defense, he changed the name in the 40s
[09:46.720 --> 09:48.760]  from the Department of War.
[09:48.760 --> 10:03.480]  Again just spinning every word, assaulting reality in every way they can.
[10:03.480 --> 10:10.560]  Now continuing with the news here today, I just want to point out that more and more
[10:10.560 --> 10:12.200]  we are successfully doing this.
[10:12.200 --> 10:19.000]  I'm shifting somewhat from 100% covering government documents, news items and developing
[10:19.000 --> 10:27.360]  breaking news to 80% of what we do being covering breaking news and information because most
[10:27.360 --> 10:38.160]  of the public does not get any of their cultural guidance from ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox News, CNN,
[10:38.160 --> 10:39.680]  you name it.
[10:39.680 --> 10:45.320]  They're getting it from the sitcoms, the dramas, the late night comedy shows.
[10:45.320 --> 10:51.320]  That's where the real indoctrination is going on to the general public with young people
[10:51.320 --> 10:57.640]  it's going on even more hardcore in the government run schools and the colleges as hardcore as
[10:57.640 --> 11:05.200]  the anti-family brainwashing is on mainstream television and Nickelodeon and the NFL and
[11:05.200 --> 11:06.200]  the rest of it.
[11:06.200 --> 11:14.160]  It is nothing compared to the captive audiences at government run reservations and government
[11:14.160 --> 11:21.960]  accredited reservations of quote, primary and secondary learning.
[11:21.960 --> 11:31.880]  And now you see them taking the military which had been a cult of death, a cult of honor,
[11:31.880 --> 11:42.240]  a cult of following orders, a mix of those, a cult of male prowess, a cult of courage
[11:42.240 --> 11:46.840]  and turning it into a cult of classic Soviet style brainwashing.
[11:46.840 --> 11:50.920]  That's why the military, the army makes the men wear red high heel shoes to know what
[11:50.920 --> 11:53.120]  it's like to be a woman.
[11:53.120 --> 11:56.800]  That's why they are announcing that they will give the green beret to women and will
[11:56.800 --> 12:05.080]  lower standards and they will give the coveted Navy SEAL a trident to women and they will
[12:05.080 --> 12:10.880]  lower standards and they will give us movies with Demi Moore a decade or more before to
[12:10.880 --> 12:18.400]  condition us and prepare us and not to empower the Navy SEALs or Army Special Operations but
[12:18.400 --> 12:20.400]  to wreck it.
[12:20.400 --> 12:25.040]  And that is the plan, that is the design, they've had top generals and the former chairman
[12:25.040 --> 12:28.960]  of the Joint Chiefs and others come out in just the last two months and say, we will
[12:28.960 --> 12:34.560]  follow orders and we will put women in front line special operations and it will completely
[12:34.560 --> 12:36.160]  wreck us.
[12:36.160 --> 12:43.880]  That's the plan, then we'll have to accept the drones, the robots, the combat robots
[12:43.880 --> 12:48.680]  with technicians of men and women miles back running them.
[12:48.680 --> 12:55.840]  This is how you take humans out of the loop to end the problem of spree decor and the
[12:55.840 --> 13:04.040]  more elite troops get, the more they try to follow common sense, common law.
[13:04.040 --> 13:07.760]  What is the different slogans of special forces groups around the world?
[13:07.760 --> 13:13.320]  To free the oppressed, to defend the weak, to bring liberty.
[13:13.320 --> 13:20.440]  Those slogans, just like do no harm with our doctors, 15 years ago in 2000, every university
[13:20.440 --> 13:27.600]  in the world's globally state UN accredited under UNESCO ended the Hippocratic Oath on
[13:27.600 --> 13:34.240]  the same year 2000, I guess 16 years ago now.
[13:34.240 --> 13:39.200]  Worldwide standardization, not to free the oppressed, not to free the weak, not to do
[13:39.200 --> 13:45.000]  no harm, but to heal, but to kill.
[13:45.000 --> 13:49.680]  They are taking humanity out of the equation and building in their own words a technocracy,
[13:49.680 --> 14:03.160]  it's why I harp on this, a technocracy that ends the decision making process for the average
[14:03.160 --> 14:04.160]  person.
[14:04.160 --> 14:07.880]  That's why they call it in public schools all over the world, zero tolerance.
[14:07.880 --> 14:14.280]  You had a toy gun with your Star Wars doll, the police are taking you to jail, you're
[14:14.280 --> 14:17.960]  not just suspended.
[14:17.960 --> 14:22.280]  You had an empty tobacco can in the back of your pickup truck, we're taking you to jail,
[14:22.280 --> 14:27.280]  zero tolerance, the police officers, the teachers aren't allowed to use their own discretion,
[14:27.280 --> 14:29.880]  that turns you into a robot.
[14:29.880 --> 14:36.080]  You said the word mother or father or he or she, we're suspending you.
[14:36.080 --> 14:42.000]  All sounds outrageous, but it's meant to be outrageous.
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.520]  Because if they can get away with outrageous things, they can get away with anything.
[14:47.520 --> 14:54.200]  And so now they feel the word African American is hurtful, so they say don't use that some
[14:54.200 --> 14:57.760]  places or don't say black or don't say this or don't say that.
[14:57.760 --> 15:04.280]  It's all meant just to create basket case mental illness.
[15:04.280 --> 15:06.440]  And that's what they're doing to the military.
[15:06.440 --> 15:11.440]  They're doing to the colleges, the high schools, the middle schools, the elementary schools
[15:11.440 --> 15:17.120]  is removing social skills, removing critical thinking, removing basic reading, writing
[15:17.120 --> 15:24.280]  on arithmetic and imposing societal collapse programs.
[15:24.280 --> 15:32.960]  This is a cultural virus on record to terminate the human family as we know it.
[15:32.960 --> 15:39.560]  That's why humans must come together around men and women being together, around families,
[15:39.560 --> 15:51.600]  around children, and around basic culture, and around gardens and metallurgy, blacksmithing,
[15:51.600 --> 15:54.680]  sewing.
[15:54.680 --> 16:01.680]  All of those activities on record now release chemicals and triggers in the brain that are
[16:01.680 --> 16:08.680]  good triggers that release basically other deeper instincts that activate your real human
[16:08.680 --> 16:10.720]  programming that God gave you.
[16:10.720 --> 16:17.320]  And it's that template that is designed to overcome any obstacle.
[16:17.320 --> 16:26.440]  And everything in the artificial world is about suppressing your normal latent talent.
[16:26.440 --> 16:33.760]  And taking your instinctive talent for tribalism or for hunting and twisting it into new languages
[16:33.760 --> 16:40.840]  not based on science but based on a science of engineered basket case mental illness to
[16:40.840 --> 16:48.040]  be offended by all culture, all symbols, all peoples including yourself with a self loathing
[16:48.040 --> 16:55.640]  of yourself and humanity to turn off your life force survival instinct.
[16:55.640 --> 17:02.080]  It is extremely sophisticated but if you're aware of the enemy programming, if you're
[17:02.080 --> 17:09.480]  aware and have joy and have happiness and have friends and have family that you love
[17:09.480 --> 17:15.720]  and people you lift up, it will shatter that control system.
[17:15.720 --> 17:19.400]  Now what I'm laying out here is the key to bringing the enemy down and Lord knows I got
[17:19.400 --> 17:20.800]  black circles around my eyes.
[17:20.800 --> 17:21.800]  I'm exhausted.
[17:21.800 --> 17:24.640]  I get very sad sometimes having to focus on this.
[17:24.640 --> 17:29.240]  I stay in the arena a lot more than most people so I have some of the side effects of having
[17:29.240 --> 17:32.080]  to study the enemy constantly.
[17:32.080 --> 17:37.640]  Don't look too long into the abyss, at least you become the abyss niche it was right again.
[17:37.640 --> 17:42.040]  But that's what does not kill you only makes you stronger as well if you're aware of the
[17:42.040 --> 17:43.600]  larger paradigm.
[17:43.600 --> 17:49.880]  So when I preach being happy and being joyful and being thankful and having less screen time
[17:49.880 --> 17:53.120]  and spending more time with your family and getting out in nature and feeling the dirt
[17:53.120 --> 17:57.720]  between your toes and going and visiting the Amish or the Mennonites, they're around your
[17:57.720 --> 18:00.320]  town and getting the raw milk.
[18:00.320 --> 18:07.160]  All of it is a journey of a thousand miles but each step is like 50 miles.
[18:07.160 --> 18:13.640]  The journey of a thousand miles does start with a single step, the Chinese proverb.
[18:13.640 --> 18:16.920]  But once you begin to walk, the first step is a centimeter.
[18:16.920 --> 18:21.880]  The next step is an inch, then a foot, then 50 feet, then 100 miles you might get pushed
[18:21.880 --> 18:25.040]  back 50 miles but the next step is 600 miles.
[18:25.040 --> 18:28.400]  Now you've walked a thousand miles, now you're doing a new level.
[18:28.400 --> 18:30.240]  Now a trillion miles lays out.
[18:30.240 --> 18:32.400]  The first step is a million miles.
[18:32.400 --> 18:34.240]  The next step is a billion miles.
[18:34.240 --> 18:39.560]  Before you know it, you've gone trillions of cultural light years from where you were
[18:39.560 --> 18:41.920]  under enemy bombardment.
[18:41.920 --> 18:46.280]  The first thing they want you to do is to think you're ugly and that you're fat and
[18:46.280 --> 18:48.760]  that you're stupid and that you're pathetic.
[18:48.760 --> 18:54.200]  Now I myself get up here and call the enemy zombies, the trendy brainwashed brain damaged
[18:54.200 --> 18:57.000]  drones, horrible, stupid, evil, hateful people.
[18:57.000 --> 19:00.280]  You have to understand they've been programmed and turned into that.
[19:00.280 --> 19:08.160]  Many of them from childhood never became conscious humans and are literal walking dead.
[19:08.160 --> 19:11.800]  So I do dislike them at a primitive level because I have to see them as an enemy and
[19:11.800 --> 19:12.800]  defeat them.
[19:12.800 --> 19:16.960]  They're gone already so I'm taking my programming and saying thank you God for this so I don't
[19:16.960 --> 19:19.200]  feel too bad about it, you are now scum in the enemy.
[19:19.200 --> 19:22.440]  I'm sorry you're gone, you're unconscious.
[19:22.440 --> 19:27.080]  But for all my hatred of the enemy, I have so much more love for everybody else and I
[19:27.080 --> 19:28.920]  understand now why I have hate for them.
[19:28.920 --> 19:33.880]  God gave it to me so that I don't feel bad when I have to look at them because I'm actually
[19:33.880 --> 19:35.040]  very sad for them.
[19:35.040 --> 19:40.440]  They're so pathetic, they're like a lobotomized child with a huge butcher knife attacking
[19:40.440 --> 19:44.160]  us and we just have to stand up to them but it's still, it doesn't give me pleasure to
[19:44.160 --> 19:48.360]  see what they've done to our people, what they've turned the human form into.
[19:48.360 --> 19:52.440]  This is what the enemy wants to do, is mutilate and vandalize humanity.
[19:52.440 --> 19:56.600]  We got big Donald Trump news coming up here after the break and concerns in full wars.
[19:56.600 --> 19:59.920]  Stay with us.

[22:04.400 --> 22:08.160]  The municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.

[24:08.080 --> 24:12.720]  Roger Stone normally comes on about once a week, but he wanted to wait until next Monday.
[24:12.720 --> 24:16.840]  He's going to be breaking at infowars.com.
[24:16.840 --> 24:23.520]  Exclusive information that he says is basically the biggest, one of the biggest, if not the
[24:23.520 --> 24:27.080]  biggest developments of the campaign.
[24:27.080 --> 24:32.840]  Major positive developments to report and big mom shells.
[24:32.840 --> 24:35.560]  So that is coming up on Monday with Roger Stone.
[24:35.560 --> 24:37.960]  I know that's like five days out still.
[24:37.960 --> 24:44.400]  That's not the new Trump news.
[24:44.400 --> 24:47.520]  And the new Trump news is not shocking claims.
[24:47.520 --> 24:52.920]  Perv Ted Cruz caught cheating with five secret mistresses.
[24:52.920 --> 24:56.200]  That's really a mean headline, even for the inquire.
[24:56.200 --> 24:58.440]  He's a perv for being with women.
[24:58.440 --> 25:03.040]  I guess in the modern world, being heterosexual is perverted, but okay, whatever.
[25:03.040 --> 25:09.080]  I thought perverted is like getting caught with a whatever.
[25:09.080 --> 25:13.960]  But continuing here, the big Donald Trump news is he just tweeted out his tens of millions
[25:13.960 --> 25:20.240]  of listeners and followers and fans, a Alex Jones video, the same one that Drudge report
[25:20.240 --> 25:24.560]  linked to a month ago that went viral and got millions of views.
[25:24.560 --> 25:26.880]  And that was my interview with Roger Stone.
[25:26.880 --> 25:30.560]  Let's go ahead and put the tweet on screen if we can for TV viewers.
[25:30.560 --> 25:32.680]  Real Donald J. Trump.
[25:32.680 --> 25:37.680]  And he goes on to say, Cruz and the Republican establishment are scared.
[25:37.680 --> 25:43.200]  And again, he just retweeted an old video from a month ago that's a YouTube copy of
[25:43.200 --> 25:48.960]  our Facebook mentions from somebody else's page, Alex Jones, Roger Stone Insider leaks
[25:48.960 --> 25:52.040]  Koch Brothers plan to stop Trump.
[25:52.040 --> 25:55.080]  And a month later, all of that meeting is public.
[25:55.080 --> 26:01.800]  It's all admitted it was all dead on, including that Jeb Bush would endorse Ted Cruz and that
[26:01.800 --> 26:03.880]  he was a sleeper agent.
[26:03.880 --> 26:04.880]  He said that a month ago.
[26:04.880 --> 26:06.360]  I think that was more than a month ago.
[26:06.360 --> 26:07.840]  What's the date on that?
[26:07.840 --> 26:10.080]  And then he was here in town.
[26:10.080 --> 26:17.240]  And then he said it again last Wednesday, and it ended up happening on Wednesday, a
[26:17.240 --> 26:18.880]  week later.
[26:18.880 --> 26:23.120]  So that's why it's important when Stone comes on the broadcast.
[26:23.120 --> 26:27.920]  That was posted on February 26, but it happened a couple days before that in our live Facebook
[26:27.920 --> 26:30.120]  mentions.
[26:30.120 --> 26:31.120]  And it's crazy.
[26:31.120 --> 26:32.840]  We did in studio two hour interview.
[26:32.840 --> 26:35.040]  We did other big interviews and those get big.
[26:35.040 --> 26:38.480]  But then I shoot some little Facebook mentions and it's got millions and millions of views
[26:38.480 --> 26:43.120]  and had a big effect thanks to dredgerport.com and others linking to it.
[26:43.120 --> 26:50.280]  But the point is you're getting real intel when you come on this broadcast.
[26:50.280 --> 26:52.920]  You're getting hardcore information.
[26:52.920 --> 26:54.200]  You're not going to get anywhere else.
[26:54.200 --> 26:58.160]  And everybody's got to differentiate themselves in media that, hey, we're special.
[26:58.160 --> 26:59.720]  You should tune in here.
[26:59.720 --> 27:02.280]  But info wars really is special.
[27:02.280 --> 27:06.000]  We really do have our finger on the pulse of what's really happening and really unfolding.
[27:06.000 --> 27:13.400]  So big news, I hate to sit on news like this till Monday, but that's what they want to do.
[27:13.400 --> 27:19.120]  And obviously a stone is somewhat of a surrogate, let's just say for Trump, I'll just leave
[27:19.120 --> 27:20.120]  it at that.
[27:20.120 --> 27:23.240]  I think everybody can tell that and knows that.
[27:23.240 --> 27:28.400]  But that's what it comes down to is that we'll have some big news for you on Monday.
[27:28.400 --> 27:32.800]  Maybe I can twist his arm until Sunday, but he thinks Monday's when he wants to do that.
[27:32.800 --> 27:37.640]  So stay tuned for that.
[27:37.640 --> 27:41.440]  I'm going to go to break along segments coming up and then I'm going to get into the latest
[27:41.440 --> 27:43.600]  Brussels, Belgium bombing news.
[27:43.600 --> 27:48.600]  And man, I got to tell you, I look at the news and info wars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[27:48.600 --> 27:52.200]  And I just cannot even believe it.
[27:52.200 --> 27:55.160]  The, how do you say their names?
[27:55.160 --> 28:02.760]  Bakarie, Bakarwee, Bakarwee brothers may have planned to blow up Belgium.
[28:02.760 --> 28:04.280]  Belgium nuclear power plants.
[28:04.280 --> 28:05.280]  That's one of the stories.
[28:05.280 --> 28:08.720]  Obviously they had those on lockdown since it happened two days ago, but here's the
[28:08.720 --> 28:09.720]  big one.
[28:09.720 --> 28:12.520]  Talan agency boss who confronted, she just talked to her.
[28:12.520 --> 28:14.320]  You're not allowed to have free speech.
[28:14.320 --> 28:18.880]  You can make her wear a hood on her head, cut her genitals off if you own her under radical
[28:18.880 --> 28:23.880]  Islam, but you don't talk if you're a liberal less than her.
[28:23.880 --> 28:29.200]  Talan agency boss who confronted a Muslim woman in London and asked her to explain Brussels
[28:29.200 --> 28:33.400]  is arrested for inciting racial hatred.
[28:33.400 --> 28:34.400]  That's right.
[28:34.400 --> 28:38.320]  A group, a part of a religion screams Allah Akbar blows you up.
[28:38.320 --> 28:39.320]  That's okay.
[28:39.320 --> 28:43.600]  But if you ask about it, you are arrested just like the yoga teacher saw these young Muslims
[28:43.600 --> 28:48.880]  celebrating the attacks, talked about it, police came and got him.
[28:48.880 --> 28:51.600]  I mean, it's incredible.
[28:51.600 --> 28:54.080]  I'm the immigrant effing your daughter.
[28:54.080 --> 28:58.720]  That's Sue Sweden is hired to head up the state funded Institute for the migrants integrating
[28:58.720 --> 28:59.720]  into society.
[28:59.720 --> 29:06.040]  So he announced in his first official tweet that your daughter's belong gosh.
[29:06.040 --> 29:10.160]  And if you criticize SWAT teams are on the way.
[29:10.160 --> 29:11.160]  Well cops are on the way.
[29:11.160 --> 29:14.360]  If you don't submit and go to jail with them and learn how to get slapped around a little
[29:14.360 --> 29:20.280]  bit, then then the SWAT teams coming.
[29:20.280 --> 29:22.840]  You want to live under leftist total oppression.
[29:22.840 --> 29:28.320]  You're going to and when they're throwing gay people off roofs, I'm telling you, the
[29:28.320 --> 29:33.520]  liberals salute it because they hate themselves and that's a sacrament.
[29:33.520 --> 29:34.920]  They're into being cuckold folks.
[29:34.920 --> 29:38.680]  They like to, it's like the guys that like to see their wife with, you know, six guys
[29:38.680 --> 29:39.680]  in bed.
[29:39.680 --> 29:43.000]  It's a family show, but we have to scientifically describe it, but it's beyond that.
[29:43.000 --> 29:46.400]  It's like guys that want to see their wife have her jaw broken or teeth pulled out with
[29:46.400 --> 29:49.000]  pliers and their head chopped off.
[29:49.000 --> 29:52.760]  We're on the March, the empires on the run.
[29:52.760 --> 29:59.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[29:59.760 --> 30:06.440]  Ted Cruz ignores the real source of radical Islam and that is the special relationship
[30:06.440 --> 30:09.720]  between the United States and Saudi Arabia.
[30:09.720 --> 30:14.440]  Presidential candidate Ted Cruz sidestepped his proposal to patrol Muslim neighborhoods
[30:14.440 --> 30:16.840]  during an interview with CNN.
[30:16.840 --> 30:20.520]  If you have a neighborhood where there is a high level of gang activity, the way to
[30:20.520 --> 30:25.320]  prevent it is you increase the law enforcement presence there and you target the gang members
[30:25.320 --> 30:26.720]  to get them off the street.
[30:26.720 --> 30:32.040]  I am talking about any area where there is a higher incidence of radical Islamic terrorism.
[30:32.040 --> 30:37.320]  Cruz completely sidestepped the real issue, that is the creation, promotion and support
[30:37.320 --> 30:43.600]  of radical Islamic terrorists by Saudi Arabia and the United States as a political opportunist
[30:43.600 --> 30:47.840]  supported by Goldman Sachs, the CFR and the establishment.
[30:47.840 --> 30:54.720]  Cruz must embrace the terror war narrative and its lies, delusions, omissions and misrepresentations
[30:54.720 --> 30:55.720]  of the truth.
[30:55.720 --> 31:25.680]  He can read more right now at Infowars.com.

[33:12.520 --> 33:18.120]  InfowarsLives.com is a dangerous place not because of evil but because of those who look
[33:18.120 --> 33:20.920]  on and do nothing.
[33:20.920 --> 33:25.280]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:25.280 --> 33:30.920]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, it's Alex Jones.
[33:30.920 --> 33:38.840]  You know that's not fluff building the show up, in fact it's pretty scary.
[33:38.840 --> 33:44.480]  Infowars is undoubtedly when it comes to actually fighting the globalist worldwide for an independent
[33:44.480 --> 33:50.760]  news agency, the biggest, the strongest, the most informed, the most effective.
[33:50.760 --> 33:57.560]  And we're small compared to the enemy constellation, we are ragtag, we are stumbling through the
[33:57.560 --> 34:01.160]  day half the time, we're in trouble.
[34:01.160 --> 34:06.560]  But so many times in history it's ragtag groups that take on the lieth but I'm here to tell
[34:06.560 --> 34:08.880]  you folks.
[34:08.880 --> 34:12.000]  There's great sites like Drudge that break through the electronic Berlin wall and show
[34:12.000 --> 34:16.480]  people the elephant in the room, there's WorldNet Daily, a few others but it's really up to
[34:16.480 --> 34:20.520]  all of you who understand what's happening, understand the paradigm.
[34:20.520 --> 34:24.720]  Start your own local news sites, start going out and covering news, start gathering city
[34:24.720 --> 34:29.240]  council information, start showing what the globalists are doing locally and people will
[34:29.240 --> 34:31.800]  come to you and you will be a leader.
[34:31.800 --> 34:38.480]  The best way to fight the enemy is to operate as a news agency and to have credibility and
[34:38.480 --> 34:45.960]  be focused but not mince words and then form satellite organizations in your area because
[34:45.960 --> 34:53.880]  information is power and war is now based on information and the enemy has their frauds,
[34:53.880 --> 34:54.880]  we have the truth.
[34:54.880 --> 34:58.320]  Can you believe Donald Trump said with all these unvetted Muslims coming in, we should
[34:58.320 --> 35:03.840]  stop all immigration until they start vetting them and doing a basic check.
[35:03.840 --> 35:07.680]  That's like saying you shouldn't open the portal on the submarine at a thousand feet
[35:07.680 --> 35:09.760]  under the water, it will kill everybody.
[35:09.760 --> 35:14.440]  Donald Trump says don't open the submarine portal and they go did you hear that psychopath?
[35:14.440 --> 35:16.480]  He said that nut.
[35:16.480 --> 35:19.880]  He said don't pour gasoline on yourself and light it on fire.
[35:19.880 --> 35:22.080]  Whoa, what will he say next?
[35:22.080 --> 35:24.040]  Don't take a gun, shove it in your mouth and pull the trigger?
[35:24.040 --> 35:28.960]  I mean, everybody knows you're supposed to do that.
[35:28.960 --> 35:31.320]  This is their attempt to overthrow reality.
[35:31.320 --> 35:32.320]  They know what they're doing.
[35:32.320 --> 35:36.200]  They want to so confuse people where the public just goes I'll give in, I won't say mother
[35:36.200 --> 35:41.120]  or father or boy or girl, I'll dress however you say, I'll talk like you say, I'll eat
[35:41.120 --> 35:47.480]  GMO, I'll take all the shots, I love you, I'll do whatever you say, just give me some
[35:47.480 --> 35:50.960]  good drugs while I die of brain damage so I don't feel the pain.
[35:50.960 --> 35:55.040]  The government's like, absolutely, we're getting euthanasia ready for you.
[35:55.040 --> 35:58.440]  Silent greens man out of people, yeah, we eat the hospitals with dead babies, yeah,
[35:58.440 --> 36:02.640]  we sell the baby parts for cosmetics, yeah, we keep them alive and harvest their organs,
[36:02.640 --> 36:04.000]  big deal.
[36:04.000 --> 36:08.880]  Everything we told you about 10, 15, 20 years ago, mainstream now, yeah, there's chimeras
[36:08.880 --> 36:13.840]  all over the United States and all over the world, part human, part animal, growing inside
[36:13.840 --> 36:18.720]  cows, sheep and pigs and we're selling their organs, big deal.
[36:18.720 --> 36:24.520]  I was talking to a family member the other day and they were talking about chimeras
[36:24.520 --> 36:29.400]  and now it was finally in the news and somebody walked over to them and said they were crazy.
[36:29.400 --> 36:35.880]  I spent around at least 30 years, these people, these people, I mean, there it is, MIT, human
[36:35.880 --> 36:41.000]  animal chimeras are gestating on US research farms and they had a bunch of articles a few
[36:41.000 --> 36:45.600]  weeks ago, a White House run group put out one and everybody in the media copied it and
[36:45.600 --> 36:51.720]  said, Jones is crazy and claims humanoid clones are growing in cows and that space aliens
[36:51.720 --> 36:52.720]  run it.
[36:52.720 --> 36:57.200]  No, I said, Chris Carter, you know, thinks it's space aliens, I guess, and I said, who
[36:57.200 --> 37:00.520]  knows, it might as well be alien, these people act like they want to destroy the planet.
[37:00.520 --> 37:06.560]  You know, the Bible says it's the devil, fallen angel from space, so I guess Christian cosmology
[37:06.560 --> 37:09.840]  is like science fiction, who knows?
[37:09.840 --> 37:15.440]  And they've got scores of articles, Jones has gone nuts, says the devil is an alien and
[37:15.440 --> 37:19.160]  runs the world, we're just stating what's in the Bible.
[37:19.160 --> 37:20.800]  I don't know what's going on.
[37:20.800 --> 37:25.480]  I just know the elite are re-engineering the entire world, creating all these abominations
[37:25.480 --> 37:30.600]  that don't even work right and are all screwed up and they're poisoning everything while
[37:30.600 --> 37:35.200]  hopping around telling us they're saving the world.
[37:35.200 --> 37:36.520]  That's all I know.
[37:36.520 --> 37:41.120]  And then putting people in charge everywhere, Paul's got to write another article.
[37:41.120 --> 37:47.480]  He's incredible, but he always writes it on one issue, which is important, but I remember
[37:47.480 --> 37:54.600]  at least 30 articles the last year where the head of the Sweden immigrant group joins ISIS
[37:54.600 --> 37:59.120]  and wants to overthrow the government and the government keeps them there.
[37:59.120 --> 38:06.680]  Or head of immigrant group, you know, tells German women, you must supply sex to us.
[38:06.680 --> 38:10.960]  And then the German government says, yes, that's a nice thing to do, you know, or the
[38:10.960 --> 38:16.680]  mayor says, don't wear short skirts, it's your fault, you know, behave yourself.
[38:16.680 --> 38:20.240]  Because this is by plan to break our will.
[38:20.240 --> 38:23.280]  I mean, look at this.
[38:23.280 --> 38:30.400]  A talent agency head sees some women wearing beekeeper suits, Halloween outfits, and they
[38:30.400 --> 38:37.120]  got their faces covered up like we're in Saudi Arabia, you go, oh, be nice, be open.
[38:37.120 --> 38:40.920]  When I go to Saudi Arabia and walk down the street with my wife without a headdress on,
[38:40.920 --> 38:41.920]  they'll kill me.
[38:41.920 --> 38:45.640]  If you teach the Bible one time, they'll put you in prison for 10 years.
[38:45.640 --> 38:47.240]  The second time they'll execute you.
[38:47.240 --> 38:53.680]  Where's the tolerance there, you filthy fascist scumbag liberals, allied with radical Islam.
[38:53.680 --> 38:58.400]  You people are filth and you know it and you love it and you cozy up to it because you're
[38:58.400 --> 38:59.680]  not really liberals.
[38:59.680 --> 39:04.480]  You are fascist takeover criminal pirates who know full well what you're doing.
[39:04.480 --> 39:10.120]  You are piratical, lazy criminal dirtbags.
[39:10.120 --> 39:19.160]  So, talent agency boss who confronted a Muslim woman in London and asked her to explain Brussels
[39:19.160 --> 39:21.360]  is arrested for inciting racial hatred.
[39:21.360 --> 39:25.040]  You guys give me the full Daily Mail article because I only got the front page, sorry.
[39:25.040 --> 39:28.720]  A PR boss who asked a Muslim woman to explain Brussels, just explain Brussels.
[39:28.720 --> 39:33.320]  Free speech, you can say that, has been arrested on suspicion of inciting racial hatred.
[39:33.320 --> 39:34.320]  That's right.
[39:34.320 --> 39:39.840]  He's been arrested for free speech in 1984 by the Ministry of Love.
[39:39.840 --> 39:44.720]  Matthew Doyle and LSE alums and partner at South London based, talent agency sparked
[39:44.720 --> 39:50.920]  outrage by the social justice warriors at Twitter and Facebook that are controlled after
[39:50.920 --> 39:54.960]  he confronted a Muslim woman about the Brussels attack which killed 34 people.
[39:54.960 --> 39:58.240]  Yeah, but those were herderves to be blown up.
[39:58.240 --> 40:01.920]  He wrote on Twitter, I confronted a Muslim woman in Criedon yesterday and asked her
[40:01.920 --> 40:03.120]  to explain Brussels.
[40:03.120 --> 40:08.120]  She said, nothing to do with me, a mealy mouth reply.
[40:08.120 --> 40:13.920]  Yeah, never, I decry that, I'm against that.
[40:13.920 --> 40:17.560]  Then there were a bunch of other tweets, no more Muslim immigration, Trump for president
[40:17.560 --> 40:22.560]  and so here come the police to intimidate free speech in the birthplace of Magna Carta
[40:22.560 --> 40:26.080]  run by a bunch of criminals now.
[40:26.080 --> 40:28.520]  Shame on you collaborators, shame on you.
[40:28.520 --> 40:33.880]  You won't stand up for free speech in England, but you love Saudi Arabia, murdering Christians
[40:33.880 --> 40:35.880]  and chopping their heads off.
[40:35.880 --> 40:40.320]  I can chop a chicken's head off and funding ISIS to go in and murder in mass and then
[40:40.320 --> 40:48.920]  another arrogant, mutated, politically Islamic radical fused in with liberal trendiness.
[40:48.920 --> 40:54.200]  Look at this, I'm the immigrant effing your daughter.
[40:54.200 --> 41:01.760]  State backed Swedish Institute hands control of Twitter account to Lebanese migrant.
[41:01.760 --> 41:04.720]  The state backed Swedish Institute handed control of official Twitter account to Lebanese
[41:04.720 --> 41:08.360]  migrant who then proceeded to tweet on it.
[41:08.360 --> 41:12.560]  I'm the immigrant effing your daughter while you're trying to sleep, ignoring her moans
[41:12.560 --> 41:15.920]  calling me daddy.
[41:15.920 --> 41:17.920]  Build as a new suite every week.
[41:17.920 --> 41:22.720]  Oh yeah, because you're one of the one Muslims kills somebody, it's a German, a Sweden, they
[41:22.720 --> 41:23.720]  did it.
[41:23.720 --> 41:28.160]  The Twitter account rotates between different individuals tweet about life in Sweden under
[41:28.160 --> 41:32.640]  the umbrella of the curators of Sweden project.
[41:32.640 --> 41:36.880]  The Swedish Institute itself is partly taxpayer funded body, which says its mission is promote
[41:36.880 --> 41:41.120]  Sweden and Swedish issues globally and then they set that up now.
[41:41.120 --> 41:42.480]  I'll see you on CNN.
[41:42.480 --> 41:50.880]  Let's look at the art of Germany or France and it's like anything but German.
[41:50.880 --> 41:55.520]  It's cultural suicide.
[41:55.520 --> 41:57.560]  Now let's continue.
[41:57.560 --> 42:03.280]  No borders activist welcomed Brussels attack as a good thing.
[42:03.280 --> 42:04.800]  A good thing.
[42:04.800 --> 42:05.800]  Go read about that.
[42:05.800 --> 42:07.800]  That's on inforwars.com.
[42:07.800 --> 42:10.120]  The view host admit Trump was right about Brussels.
[42:10.120 --> 42:11.280]  I can't believe it.
[42:11.280 --> 42:13.000]  He seems reasonable.
[42:13.000 --> 42:18.320]  Oh yeah, in the full clip, if you're not vetting anybody and they stopped vetting and even
[42:18.320 --> 42:22.960]  looking at IDs, we have to do this, which is in the news.
[42:22.960 --> 42:29.560]  Dozens of college students in fear, close quote in Atlanta after Trump 2016, it chalked
[42:29.560 --> 42:33.680]  across campus, not Trump KKK, which the false flaggers do.
[42:33.680 --> 42:34.680]  No, no, no.
[42:34.680 --> 42:35.680]  Trump 2016.
[42:35.680 --> 42:40.320]  And they're now having psychologists and meetings and having to cancel part of the school as
[42:40.320 --> 42:47.920]  everyone goes in and says, we're scared, we're so much robbed, it was almost as bad
[42:47.920 --> 42:51.800]  as Yale last year.
[42:51.800 --> 42:56.960]  And then again this year, but last year, they fired them this year, where they were calling
[42:56.960 --> 43:00.120]  for all costume parties to be banned, period.
[43:00.120 --> 43:04.920]  And for a dress code to be in, we're so liberal, dressed like we say, we're not in a cold
[43:04.920 --> 43:06.640]  free thing.
[43:06.640 --> 43:11.080]  And then the two professors over that department said on email saying, listen, costume parties
[43:11.080 --> 43:12.080]  are part of freedom.
[43:12.080 --> 43:13.080]  This is true liberalism.
[43:13.080 --> 43:18.120]  You're allowed to have different ideas and dress like you want, and you have your freedom
[43:18.120 --> 43:19.120]  as well.
[43:19.120 --> 43:21.400]  And so they caught them out in the square and began screaming at them and threatening
[43:21.400 --> 43:27.120]  them and threatening to hit them and going, help me, I'm scared, I'm not safe, oh my gosh,
[43:27.120 --> 43:28.120]  you're hurting me.
[43:28.120 --> 43:32.080]  I mean, I can't even scream as loud and as hysterically and as freaked out as they did
[43:32.080 --> 43:37.120]  and guess what, Yale fired both of them, fired the people that dare say that was freedom.
[43:37.120 --> 43:41.320]  Because you think it's crazy that they got a guy out there running something saying your
[43:41.320 --> 43:43.200]  daughter's mine.
[43:43.200 --> 43:47.840]  I've got the Imam of Jerusalem on TV going, we are coming to America and Europe.
[43:47.840 --> 43:48.840]  You are weak.
[43:48.840 --> 43:49.840]  Europeans are weak.
[43:49.840 --> 43:51.340]  We will take your daughters.
[43:51.340 --> 43:57.600]  We rule you now, like out of a movie, like out of the Blues Brothers, where they go,
[43:57.600 --> 43:58.960]  how much for your life?
[43:58.960 --> 44:06.320]  How much for the little, hey, I mean, this is what's just, just the frothing.
[44:06.320 --> 44:07.320]  You have no instinct.
[44:07.320 --> 44:08.320]  You have no will.
[44:08.320 --> 44:09.560]  You have no strength.
[44:09.560 --> 44:10.680]  You have no culture.
[44:10.680 --> 44:18.160]  We're going to eat you like a piece of steak on a, on a shish kebab, you, you slaves.
[44:18.160 --> 44:20.880]  We're coming to take your women.
[44:20.880 --> 44:21.880]  Nothing will stop us.
[44:21.880 --> 44:22.880]  We're going to kill you too.
[44:22.880 --> 44:25.000]  We're going to beat your brains out.
[44:25.000 --> 44:29.720]  We're going to jihad all of you and they're not even the Wahhabis with the headdresses
[44:29.720 --> 44:30.720]  on.
[44:30.720 --> 44:31.720]  They weren't like gangster shirts.
[44:31.720 --> 44:38.640]  It's like mutated into weaponized CIA, Hollywood garbage, Islam is coming and your daughters
[44:38.640 --> 44:42.840]  will wear the hijab.
[44:42.840 --> 44:48.200]  And again, this is done for cultural clash and to make sure the radical Muslims are accepted
[44:48.200 --> 44:56.160]  and they can dominate the Jordanians, the Iraqis, some of the Shiite groups, some of
[44:56.160 --> 44:59.560]  the Alawites that are not radical and have a history of freedom.
[44:59.560 --> 45:05.120]  Our governments are overthrowing secular governments and putting the worst radicals run out of
[45:05.120 --> 45:06.120]  Saudi Arabia.
[45:06.120 --> 45:07.120]  You can.
[45:07.120 --> 45:08.680]  The enemy attack.
[45:08.680 --> 45:13.240]  And when they blow stuff up and shoot people up, they're going to take our freedoms as
[45:13.240 --> 45:19.520]  they've announced, Viper teams at bus stations, train stations, malls, searching everyone
[45:19.520 --> 45:25.200]  while the borders open and they fly planes in and don't even check their IDs.
[45:25.200 --> 45:27.880]  You see how that works?
[45:27.880 --> 45:29.560]  Now the police don't like what's happening.
[45:29.560 --> 45:33.280]  Even the feds know what's happening and think it's wrong, but it doesn't matter because
[45:33.280 --> 45:40.600]  we're all directed by the criminal bureaucracy that is so arrogant, it's saying we'll appoint
[45:40.600 --> 45:45.360]  Hillary of Bernie Beats and we'll appoint somebody else if Trump's the nominee.
[45:45.360 --> 45:47.960]  We just won't let him have it.
[45:47.960 --> 45:52.920]  This is outside criminal groups that have hijacked everything and are now admitting
[45:52.920 --> 45:58.280]  it to you and admitting they're preparing for a purge of veterans, returning veterans,
[45:58.280 --> 46:04.800]  gun owners, Christians, conservatives, libertarians and others.
[46:04.800 --> 46:08.600]  They're taking over and they're bringing in their muscle.
[46:08.600 --> 46:13.840]  They're bringing in combat veterans by the millions into Europe and the hundreds of
[46:13.840 --> 46:19.960]  thousands from the Syria affair, trained in Qatar, trained in Saudi Arabia, trained sleeper
[46:19.960 --> 46:20.960]  cells.
[46:20.960 --> 46:22.360]  This is the military, by the way, knows this.
[46:22.360 --> 46:25.480]  And you know, I've got top military contacts on the record.
[46:25.480 --> 46:26.480]  They have confirmed.
[46:26.480 --> 46:28.040]  They said, no, it's true.
[46:28.040 --> 46:30.800]  And we're going to be ordered to stand down during all this and we're not going to do
[46:30.800 --> 46:31.800]  it.
[46:31.800 --> 46:36.320]  Do you understand that the people running the government are going to give the addresses
[46:36.320 --> 46:41.360]  of combat and special forces veterans to these Muslim groups when they activate them
[46:41.360 --> 46:43.320]  to wipe them out?
[46:43.320 --> 46:46.120]  I cannot believe how bold the globalist are, but you know what?
[46:46.120 --> 46:49.440]  We deserve it because we've been so gullible.
[46:49.440 --> 46:51.680]  I cannot believe it.
[46:51.680 --> 46:55.400]  For two years, the FBI and federal marshals tried to stop the San Bernardino shooters
[46:55.400 --> 47:00.000]  and were investigated and almost charged with civil rights violations for investigating
[47:00.000 --> 47:01.720]  those two.
[47:01.720 --> 47:04.880]  The sleeper cells are being given new identities.
[47:04.880 --> 47:08.040]  They're not even being given Middle Eastern or Arabic identities.
[47:08.040 --> 47:14.880]  They are being given new fake names and covers by the feds as we speak in every major city.
[47:14.880 --> 47:16.360]  We have a report coming next week.
[47:16.360 --> 47:17.560]  Just wait.
[47:17.560 --> 47:22.200]  It's in the news, but we have, oh, it's all just over the top.
[47:22.200 --> 47:25.720]  I can't believe my life is... Info wars is insane.
[47:25.720 --> 47:27.760]  You ought to be behind the scenes here, folks.
[47:27.760 --> 47:28.840]  You ought to see it for yourself.
[47:28.840 --> 47:31.200]  This country is being completely set up.
[47:31.200 --> 47:35.640]  God help us that this country awakened.
[47:35.640 --> 47:39.720]  The elite ran America, helped set up a world empire with it, and now they're getting ready
[47:39.720 --> 47:43.320]  to fully gut it and bring it down as a trophy to mount on the wall.
[47:43.320 --> 47:45.520]  The globalist hate Christians.
[47:45.520 --> 47:51.000]  If you even have a Christian family and background, they want to kill you.
[47:51.000 --> 47:52.320]  They're bitter clingers.
[47:52.320 --> 47:54.440]  They hate you.
[47:54.440 --> 47:58.320]  The only way you can get out of this is to join them and hurt innocent people, and nobody's
[47:58.320 --> 48:00.280]  going to do that.
[48:00.280 --> 48:05.480]  And they've taken our restraint and the fact that their operation is so over the top for
[48:05.480 --> 48:08.560]  weakness.
[48:08.560 --> 48:09.840]  And maybe, maybe we are weak.
[48:09.840 --> 48:15.080]  Maybe we deserve to have to hand our daughters and our families over to people that say they
[48:15.080 --> 48:16.200]  own us.
[48:16.200 --> 48:20.880]  Maybe this is our self-loathing and our hatred, and we will become a third world help it.
[48:20.880 --> 48:25.440]  I mean, you know, even Lew Rockwell came out and Pat Buchanan said the West is now committing
[48:25.440 --> 48:27.320]  suicide in front of our eyes.
[48:27.320 --> 48:32.680]  This is the leadership that runs things is diabolical and evil and exempts themselves
[48:32.680 --> 48:37.200]  from everything they do to us.
[48:37.200 --> 48:42.360]  Pastor Manning's coming up, and I think he's already hosting the fourth hour.
[48:42.360 --> 48:46.000]  Before I go any further, this is some really important information, so please listen very,
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.440]  very intently, because it's a big deal.
[48:48.440 --> 48:53.840]  Most people don't do the full deep cleanse, and they don't do the apple cider vinegar
[48:53.840 --> 48:55.880]  and all the rest of it, the six day cleanse.
[48:55.880 --> 48:56.880]  That is super dramatic.
[48:56.880 --> 49:01.720]  A lot of folks just do the liver shield, and they also do the deep cleanse, which is a
[49:01.720 --> 49:07.560]  totally separate product that detoxifies and draws so much garbage out of the body.
[49:07.560 --> 49:12.800]  And with all the things we're being hit by, and all the poisons, and all the rest of it,
[49:12.800 --> 49:16.920]  it's now more important than ever to chelate and detoxify.

[50:12.600 --> 50:18.880]  into the rock and then comes out like oil that is biological.
[50:18.880 --> 50:23.200]  Most oil is abiotic, but some of it is actually biological in nature, and this is what chelage
[50:23.200 --> 50:24.200]  is.
[50:24.200 --> 50:29.200]  But it's an organic, super essential oil, indescribable, put the Russian athletes, one

[50:45.720 --> 50:47.280]  you want in water and drink it.
[50:47.280 --> 50:48.280]  It tastes pretty good.
[50:48.280 --> 50:53.160]  It doesn't taste great, and you can see big effects there by itself as well.

[51:59.520 --> 52:03.440]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[52:03.440 --> 52:07.600]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young books in
[52:07.600 --> 52:09.640]  head-to-head fitness tests.
[52:09.640 --> 52:11.520]  How is this even possible?
[52:11.520 --> 52:15.960]  Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated
[52:15.960 --> 52:19.160]  fountain-of-youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[52:19.160 --> 52:22.560]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's

[52:26.960 --> 52:32.440]  Previously this drink was only available to elite military units, but for a limited time,
[52:32.440 --> 52:37.120]  the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free sample packs
[52:37.120 --> 52:40.080]  specifically for our conservative friends.
[52:40.080 --> 52:41.600]  But you must act fast.
[52:41.600 --> 52:45.560]  Due to the high demand from members of the Coast Guard, our supply is extremely limited

[54:27.000 --> 54:33.000]  After years of Islamists' invasion of Europe, Bordekayim urged Donald Trump, make America
[54:33.000 --> 54:34.000]  great again.
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.520]  You were an example for many of us here.
[54:36.520 --> 54:41.440]  And again, folks, a lot of third-world populations do improve your city when you bring in a big
[54:41.440 --> 54:42.440]  group of people.
[54:42.440 --> 54:48.600]  They've got energy, they want to work hard, they bring food, their culture's clothing.
[54:48.600 --> 54:49.600]  It enriches.
[54:49.600 --> 54:53.800]  That's the fun part about New York City, all the great different areas you can go to.
[54:53.800 --> 54:59.240]  It's fun, but the cultures work together and they share all this great fusion food.
[54:59.240 --> 55:04.560]  They're like Chinese with Southern cooking or, I mean, it's wild.
[55:04.560 --> 55:07.240]  But no, that's not what happens.
[55:07.240 --> 55:11.760]  Islam is run by Wahhabis who are the most extreme people you can imagine and basically
[55:11.760 --> 55:13.440]  imprison everybody.
[55:13.440 --> 55:16.040]  It's a death cult.
[55:16.040 --> 55:21.880]  And their allied with the left and the Saudi Arabians basically own our governments.
[55:21.880 --> 55:25.760]  And they have total disdain when one of the kings comes to France, they'll shut down ten
[55:25.760 --> 55:31.160]  miles of populated beach so he doesn't have to look at people.
[55:31.160 --> 55:35.760]  They rule us just like the filthy British crown, all of them.
[55:35.760 --> 55:41.800]  It's unbelievable, it's pathetic, but this is political correctness.
[55:41.800 --> 55:47.600]  And you've got the latest study of the new king lecturing us in the news and lecturing
[55:47.600 --> 55:50.320]  Donald Trump.
[55:50.320 --> 55:59.720]  You're not my king, you are the fourth generation, third generation of bandits that robbed people
[55:59.720 --> 56:05.120]  in the desert for thousands of years, you're sex slavers.
[56:05.120 --> 56:08.560]  That's what your family made money in, that's who you are.
[56:08.560 --> 56:12.160]  So of course you've adopted a brand of Islam where women are slaves.
[56:12.160 --> 56:16.280]  I mean, you are literally the filth of earth.
[56:16.280 --> 56:18.640]  I just, you're not my god.
[56:18.640 --> 56:20.760]  No, I will break the political correctness.
[56:20.760 --> 56:29.920]  I am not for pouring acid on little girl's faces, filth, go to hell where you came from.
[56:29.920 --> 56:33.840]  And anyone else hating on about any enemy will be brought to justice, understand that.
[56:33.840 --> 56:37.840]  I'm sorry, let's go to this leader of this party, warning two weeks before the attacks,
[56:37.840 --> 56:40.680]  here it is.
[56:40.680 --> 56:43.920]  I fully support Donald Trump.
[56:43.920 --> 56:50.800]  I am not a professional politician, and I also want to restart, to reset our current
[56:50.800 --> 56:54.360]  and inefficient political system here.
[56:54.360 --> 56:58.800]  America should not become another Brussels.
[56:58.800 --> 57:04.920]  It was once a vibrant, entrepreneurial, joyful, peaceful city.
[57:04.920 --> 57:15.480]  That was before Brussels becoming a third world city, with a majority of Muslim migrants
[57:15.480 --> 57:25.120]  within 15 to 20 years, according to demographic studies, but more than half of them have strong
[57:25.120 --> 57:31.080]  Islamist beliefs as well as anti-Semitic prejudice.
[57:31.080 --> 57:39.960]  And this situation, already worrying, is aggravated by the current migrant crisis, with the invasion
[57:39.960 --> 57:47.920]  of Europe that our European leaders failed so far to prevent.
[57:47.920 --> 57:57.480]  The artists that have killed a few months ago, 130 innocent people in Paris, and wounded
[57:57.480 --> 58:04.040]  many more, came out of them from Brussels.
[58:04.040 --> 58:12.560]  Mr. Trump, we have this in common, we speak the truth, we name things.
[58:12.560 --> 58:21.160]  Of course, the political and media elites will never forgive us for that, but ordinary
[58:21.160 --> 58:31.680]  citizens, the voiceless, are not fooled or abused, Mr. Trump, make America great again.
[58:31.680 --> 58:59.720]  We'll be back, we'll be back with Jihadist threatening, stay with us.
[58:59.720 --> 59:02.120]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[59:02.120 --> 59:07.400]  I am a relatively short time listener, and I'm a quite a supporter of your fine, fine
[59:07.400 --> 59:08.400]  products.
[59:08.400 --> 59:09.400]  Welcome to the InfoWare.

[59:21.480 --> 59:22.480]  have they worked for you?
[59:22.480 --> 59:25.440]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.

[59:26.440 --> 59:34.760]  Everything from SuperMail, to BrainForce, to Winterson, X2, even got a little DNA force,
[59:34.760 --> 59:38.480]  so when I just re-upped everything, and I just went to Autofill.

[1:00:12.920 --> 1:00:19.680]  Joe Biggs has sent me a text telling me about this, maybe you didn't call him to show about
[1:00:19.680 --> 1:00:20.680]  it.
[1:00:20.680 --> 1:00:24.000]  He's got the flu and pneumonia.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:26.880]  He's had all sorts of lung issues because he was in an armored vehicle that was on fire
[1:00:26.880 --> 1:00:31.640]  and it took him a while, I think like 15 minutes to get him out, so he coughs up a lot of blood
[1:00:31.640 --> 1:00:35.840]  and still the VA won't help him, and they won't even fill his prescription.
[1:00:35.840 --> 1:00:39.960]  Somebody go over to Biggs' house and go get him and take him to the doctor, and I'll
[1:00:39.960 --> 1:00:42.880]  pay for it just because the VA's not doing it.
[1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:47.040]  Somebody go get him before he ends up getting sicker, I know he's been sick for two days.
[1:00:47.040 --> 1:00:51.040]  Somebody do pick somebody from the office to go get Biggs and take him to the doctor.
[1:00:51.040 --> 1:00:54.960]  Might as well shoot a story about it, I know that's what he wants to do.
[1:00:54.960 --> 1:00:58.040]  He's always complaining about the VA, how he's been there probably 20 times since he
[1:00:58.040 --> 1:01:02.200]  moved to Austin, they always say they lost his paperwork.
[1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:07.320]  He's honorably discharged, purple hearts, whole nine yards, he's got shrapnel wounds
[1:01:07.320 --> 1:01:12.440]  all over him, but blown up in vehicles, legs all broken arms, you name it, and they want
[1:01:12.440 --> 1:01:17.000]  him to fix his knee, and I'm just so tired of it, I'm always like, well, here, let's
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  get insurance.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:20.520]  No, they're supposed to pay for it, they don't give him anything.
[1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:25.320]  They have these big, giant buildings, though, I'm not blaming the average, even VA person,
[1:01:25.320 --> 1:01:28.960]  but the death panels, the don't treat list, I'm so tired of it.
[1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:31.920]  Just somebody coming here and waving at the door, just let me know somebody's going to
[1:01:31.920 --> 1:01:32.920]  do it.
[1:01:32.920 --> 1:01:37.600]  I don't have a McBrain or friends, it's a McBrain with a camera, too.
[1:01:37.600 --> 1:01:41.280]  Let's go show what's going on and go show the VA, first came to the doctor getting better,
[1:01:41.280 --> 1:01:45.120]  but I mean, that's a dramatic show, I'm not getting treatment, you can even call them,
[1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:48.880]  maybe even go in again after you get some medicine, but this is the type of garbage
[1:01:48.880 --> 1:01:53.120]  I'm talking about, and those two are friends, or jacari, whoever, I wish he'd get them over
[1:01:53.120 --> 1:02:00.000]  there and get bigs at the hospital or to the clinic, this is just ridiculous.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:03.240]  Well I have the flu and pneumonia, the VA wouldn't fill my prescription, even though
[1:02:03.240 --> 1:02:06.600]  they said I am in the system and recognize the VA patient.
[1:02:06.600 --> 1:02:10.520]  They said I needed to go to eligibility and get an appointment for later with the doctor
[1:02:10.520 --> 1:02:17.080]  so they could get an ER did last night, by then my lungs would be so full of liquid.
[1:02:17.080 --> 1:02:22.720]  So they essentially said F off and have to wait for an appointment later on, not today,
[1:02:22.720 --> 1:02:23.920]  like in a week.
[1:02:23.920 --> 1:02:29.320]  Good thing pneumonia isn't one of those bad things, he's sarcastic, and so we're going
[1:02:29.320 --> 1:02:32.880]  to document what's happening to bigs, because I was already talking to him last night, he
[1:02:32.880 --> 1:02:35.920]  was so mad, I wanted to do a report about it when he gets better, so that's how I can
[1:02:35.920 --> 1:02:36.920]  speak for him.
[1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:39.640]  That's what he wants to do, so let's go make sure he's getting better.
[1:02:39.640 --> 1:02:43.840]  I didn't know he went to the ER last night after I talked to him at midnight, I didn't
[1:02:43.840 --> 1:02:46.160]  know he was that sick, so pray for Joe Biggs.
[1:02:46.160 --> 1:02:52.400]  What an insane example of how we're bringing in all these jihadis, we're bringing all these
[1:02:52.400 --> 1:02:57.160]  people from war-torn areas where our own government financed the overthrow, or the attempted overthrow
[1:02:57.160 --> 1:03:03.720]  of Libya and Syria, overthrew our allies that stabilized the whole region, religious freedom,
[1:03:03.720 --> 1:03:08.120]  you name it, women had more freedoms in Egypt than many areas, all of that erased.
[1:03:08.120 --> 1:03:14.320]  Our government overthrowing it, putting Morrissey in, and then trying to block a new government
[1:03:14.320 --> 1:03:19.320]  coming in that stopped that, and the jihadists, once they got control of the government, were
[1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:24.920]  blowing up police stations, bombing ships, attacking the Navy, attacking the Marines,
[1:03:24.920 --> 1:03:33.160]  crucifying Christians in the government palace, upside down, and then they raided their houses
[1:03:33.160 --> 1:03:37.280]  and the Egyptian government came out and said, Obama is running the Muslim Brotherhood, we
[1:03:37.280 --> 1:03:40.880]  have all the documents, we can't believe it, why did you do this?
[1:03:40.880 --> 1:03:44.720]  And then suddenly, you never hear about Egypt in the news anymore, and now Egypt is allied
[1:03:44.720 --> 1:03:53.960]  with Russia, been allied with the US for 45 years, plus.
[1:03:53.960 --> 1:04:00.120]  Now has brought in the Russian Navy and Russian weapons to protect them, and you see the Egyptians
[1:04:00.120 --> 1:04:04.040]  on their TV channels translated into English, and it's their generals, it's their leadership,
[1:04:04.040 --> 1:04:09.480]  very smart, educated people that want to be free and want to have science and want to
[1:04:09.480 --> 1:04:17.720]  be prosperous, an ancient civilization, 6,000 plus years old, and it's their top generals
[1:04:17.720 --> 1:04:21.720]  and leaders on TV going, why do you fund the jihadists to kill us?
[1:04:21.720 --> 1:04:23.000]  Why do you want to overthrow?
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:28.720]  We want election governments, but you can't blow up 500 churches in one month, they blow
[1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:31.120]  up thousands.
[1:04:31.120 --> 1:04:36.080]  Two runs our country, and they got all the documents out of, what we told you before
[1:04:36.080 --> 1:04:40.360]  was even in the news, from Dr. Corsi, he had the documents, other documents, Obama and
[1:04:40.360 --> 1:04:47.000]  his cousins and others running things out of Kenya, just south of Egypt, up the Nile,
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:53.440]  trying to overthrow Egypt and put foaming at the mouth, head chopper lunatics on, who
[1:04:53.440 --> 1:04:59.440]  just run around in diapers all day, beating their wives up, doing no work.
[1:04:59.440 --> 1:05:05.520]  The left-leaning women from the popular daytime TV show, The View, are finally starting to
[1:05:05.520 --> 1:05:12.680]  admit that they agree with Donald Trump on his foreign policy and views on ISIS.
[1:05:12.680 --> 1:05:15.120]  I thought Donald Trump sounded really reasonable today.
[1:05:15.120 --> 1:05:21.560]  My law enforcement background kicked in, because we need to be forceful, we can't have these
[1:05:21.560 --> 1:05:27.040]  muted responses to terror, and let me also say this about Donald Trump, we trash him
[1:05:27.040 --> 1:05:33.760]  often here, bottom line is in January, and you've been saying that, Raven, in January
[1:05:33.760 --> 1:05:38.840]  of this year, he said Brussels was a hellhole, he said there is something going on, Maria,
[1:05:38.840 --> 1:05:41.040]  and it is not good talking about Belgium.
[1:05:41.040 --> 1:05:42.040]  He was right.
[1:05:42.040 --> 1:05:43.040]  So he's right on a couple of things.
[1:05:43.040 --> 1:05:45.560]  So his foreign policy isn't so outrageous.
[1:05:45.560 --> 1:05:48.240]  So is Donald Trump really the voice of reason?
[1:05:48.240 --> 1:05:53.360]  And which candidate makes you feel safer, Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton?
[1:05:53.360 --> 1:05:55.920]  Let us know what you think in the comment section.

[1:06:58.920 --> 1:07:04.840]  In the first decade of my battle against the globalist, I gained close to 100 pounds.
[1:07:04.840 --> 1:07:09.560]  Now in the last four years, with help from the products at InfowarsLife.com, I have lost
[1:07:09.560 --> 1:07:12.280]  80 plus pounds of that weight.
[1:07:12.280 --> 1:07:17.040]  And as many viewers have noted, the weight loss has accelerated in the last year.
[1:07:17.040 --> 1:07:21.000]  The big turning point was when I did my first liver cleanse.
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:25.240]  My friends, I have gotten a lot of dramatic results with the incredible products at InfowarsLife.com,
[1:07:25.240 --> 1:07:30.960]  but the most dramatic hands down and the reviewers agree with me is the ultimate cleanse pack
[1:07:30.960 --> 1:07:32.360]  and the results you will see.
[1:07:32.360 --> 1:07:36.840]  We're giving you 20% off the ultimate cleanse pack with liver shield, oxy powder and deep
[1:07:36.840 --> 1:07:41.040]  cleanse all combined with a huge 20% discount at InfowarsLife.com.
[1:07:41.040 --> 1:07:45.040]  A lot of my family and a lot of the office are now doing the cleanse with me and so I'm
[1:07:45.040 --> 1:07:50.200]  challenging you, the fellow Infowars, to take action with me and do the cleanse as well.
[1:07:50.200 --> 1:07:54.520]  Let's go to InfowarsLife.com for yourself, go to the liver cleanse, deep cleanse page
[1:07:54.520 --> 1:07:56.120]  and see the facts.
[1:07:56.120 --> 1:08:24.360]  That is game changing.
[1:08:24.360 --> 1:08:27.320]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to play the clip from the view where they
[1:08:27.320 --> 1:08:33.000]  come out and say Donald Trump really is making sense and these are the liberal women on the
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  show.
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:39.360]  We've got the leader of one of the major parties in Belgium saying Donald Trump's absolutely
[1:08:39.360 --> 1:08:42.840]  right, we're going to face more terror attacks, that was two weeks ago, we just played that
[1:08:42.840 --> 1:08:43.840]  clip earlier.
[1:08:43.840 --> 1:08:48.640]  I'm going to play it again, it's so important and then we have this clip that is a Michael
[1:08:48.640 --> 1:08:57.600]  Delaforte who went as a Westerner, joined ISIS to create a caliphate and was inside
[1:08:57.600 --> 1:09:02.080]  of it until he figured out that it was a cult, boy that's like going to a clan rally and
[1:09:02.080 --> 1:09:06.160]  sitting around and figuring out you're with a bunch of white supremacists, I mean how
[1:09:06.160 --> 1:09:11.440]  hard is it to figure out these people are whacked out of their brains and he's still
[1:09:11.440 --> 1:09:12.440]  supporting it I guess.
[1:09:12.440 --> 1:09:19.480]  So, well how is he walking around on TV, it's just crazy.
[1:09:19.480 --> 1:09:24.320]  And then I've got all these other clips I mentioned where the police went to the talent
[1:09:24.320 --> 1:09:29.280]  agency heads house because he put out a tweet that in the park he talked to women wearing
[1:09:29.280 --> 1:09:34.680]  these beekeeper suits, these the hoods, talent agency boss who confronted a Muslim woman
[1:09:34.680 --> 1:09:38.320]  in London just asked her to explain Brussels, she of course wouldn't disavow it, that's
[1:09:38.320 --> 1:09:45.720]  the whole point, was arrested for inciting racial hatred, it's racial, it's religious
[1:09:45.720 --> 1:09:49.440]  and I mean I can't go to Saudi Arabia and preach the Bible, they'll kill me on the
[1:09:49.440 --> 1:09:54.800]  second offense, put me in jail for 10 years on the first and then this guy, I'm the immigrant
[1:09:54.800 --> 1:10:00.040]  bleeping your daughter, this is who the state appointed over the state funded board to represent
[1:10:00.040 --> 1:10:05.400]  Swedish culture and his tweet said I'm the immigrant effing your daughter while you're
[1:10:05.400 --> 1:10:08.600]  trying to sleep ignoring her moans calling me daddy.
[1:10:08.600 --> 1:10:13.000]  Now folks, we're a radio show slash TV show, I've been on the year 21 years, everybody
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:16.640]  knows, I have a very clean mouth, okay.
[1:10:16.640 --> 1:10:20.520]  But I have to get like this because this is who governments are putting in charge, this
[1:10:20.520 --> 1:10:24.520]  is what they're saying, this is what they're pushing, this is what they're doing.
[1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:29.160]  I have to talk about five-year-olds being taught how to perform oral sex because that's
[1:10:29.160 --> 1:10:32.680]  what they teach in schools, I have to talk about five-year-olds being confused about
[1:10:32.680 --> 1:10:38.680]  their gender with a third bathroom put in because that's what they're doing, it is just
[1:10:38.680 --> 1:10:46.640]  a full out insane devilish assault and it's crazy.
[1:10:46.640 --> 1:10:52.600]  No borders activist welcomes Brussels attack as a good thing, this is the left celebrating
[1:10:52.600 --> 1:10:58.680]  radical Islam which is becoming dominant Islam, leftist urge migrants to exploit chaos caused
[1:10:58.680 --> 1:11:03.680]  by bombings, the bridges are being overflowed, the trains, the ships, the tunnel, it was
[1:11:03.680 --> 1:11:07.440]  in the news last week, the British police arrested five people last year, thousands run through
[1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:10.360]  a day, Europe is wide open.
[1:11:10.360 --> 1:11:16.400]  They announced in major French news last month that quote, quote, the French highway system
[1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:24.320]  is collapsing and in a state of anarchy with over a half million migrants invaders that
[1:11:24.320 --> 1:11:27.920]  haven't found a place yet of the other two million that have come into France last three
[1:11:27.920 --> 1:11:31.680]  years, it's five million total in Europe, Germany and France the lion's share because
[1:11:31.680 --> 1:11:37.040]  it is total bedlam, go to YouTube, there are thousands of videos in France of just cars
[1:11:37.040 --> 1:11:41.040]  and families being drug outed, people breaking into trucks and grabbing them out and beating
[1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:46.080]  them and aid workers trying to give them food, beating them, I mean just every day, BBC being
[1:11:46.080 --> 1:11:51.560]  attacked in Sweden at a train station, broad daylight and they're so entitled, I was in
[1:11:51.560 --> 1:11:58.440]  London the last time I was videotaping just to get some scene cutaways and Muslims across
[1:11:58.440 --> 1:12:03.000]  the street ran over screaming at me that I was filming and of course I was American,
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:06.800]  I said you know basically get out of my face, you want a bow up, let's go, I wasn't looking
[1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:10.320]  for trouble but I got a free speech, then they turned around and ran off, they were
[1:12:10.320 --> 1:12:13.720]  used to Brits, I'm not trying to be mean, Brits didn't used to be like this, they literally
[1:12:13.720 --> 1:12:17.600]  get on the ground in a fetal position and begin urinating all over themselves, that
[1:12:17.600 --> 1:12:21.640]  will be the new national flag, I mean this is crazy, that same thing happened to me when
[1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:27.040]  I was about to interview a former MI5 agent for my film Terror Storm outside of hotel,
[1:12:27.040 --> 1:12:30.760]  I'm getting a cutaway shot, he calls me on the cell phone, I'm arriving in three minutes,
[1:12:30.760 --> 1:12:34.720]  good, I go for the film and it's in the film, I want you arriving when you pull up in the
[1:12:34.720 --> 1:12:40.120]  cab as a cutaway shot, because I also run camera, not just my crew, I'm out there waiting
[1:12:40.120 --> 1:12:43.160]  to have my camera and these people come up and get in my face, his wife's got a hood
[1:12:43.160 --> 1:12:48.160]  on, he speaks some English, I go I'm making a film, a guy's coming, he yells at me again,
[1:12:48.160 --> 1:12:53.200]  I said listen, go call the police if you want, free speech, I'm working here, what I'm saying
[1:12:53.200 --> 1:12:59.920]  is the attitude is over the top, arrogant and aggressive and I am not going to be a
[1:12:59.920 --> 1:13:07.160]  slave here ladies and gentlemen, I am not putting up with it, it's like, national review
[1:13:07.160 --> 1:13:12.520]  last week had an article going, it's white people and also rust belt people, poor people
[1:13:12.520 --> 1:13:17.760]  that don't like NAFTA and get in their jobs being gone but like Trump, you deserve it,
[1:13:17.760 --> 1:13:22.320]  you deserve it and it was like this, I don't like seeing any group put down and told they
[1:13:22.320 --> 1:13:26.080]  deserve something, they're a bunch of scum just for who they are, but David Knight made
[1:13:26.080 --> 1:13:30.720]  the point, I'm not going to sit at the back of the bus because I'm white, they have taken
[1:13:30.720 --> 1:13:35.520]  everything that Martin, Martin Luther King talked about that was so true and inverted
[1:13:35.520 --> 1:13:40.640]  it now and it is a crazy free for all where every weirdo leftist group, you know, some
[1:13:40.640 --> 1:13:46.120]  10-year-old quote, transsexual can get to go in the room with your daughters and take
[1:13:46.120 --> 1:13:50.560]  showers with them at gym because they think they're a girl, it's all about them dominating
[1:13:50.560 --> 1:13:54.680]  us, I'm going to Pastor Manning with a balance of the hour, sort of taking your calls at
[1:13:54.680 --> 1:13:58.640]  about 40 after but I am wound up, I'm going to play this one clip we didn't get to last
[1:13:58.640 --> 1:14:06.440]  hour, this is this person that fought reportedly with ISIS, Michael Delaforte and talks about
[1:14:06.440 --> 1:14:11.320]  his dream to live under an Islamic caliphate would become a reality in Europe and now
[1:14:11.320 --> 1:14:15.840]  he I guess he still supports it and is I guess allowed to go around and do this, so let's
[1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:16.840]  go ahead and play it.
[1:14:16.840 --> 1:14:21.080]  How many people do you know from your group of friends who've left for Syria who went
[1:14:21.080 --> 1:14:22.080]  to join ISIS?
[1:14:22.080 --> 1:14:23.080]  Sixty.
[1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:24.080]  Sixty?
[1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:25.080]  Yeah.
[1:14:25.080 --> 1:14:26.080]  What happened to those 60 people?
[1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:27.080]  One of them went to paradise.
[1:14:27.080 --> 1:14:28.080]  Went to paradise huh?
[1:14:28.080 --> 1:14:36.080]  Look at that guy, I think he's so tough and scary, looks like a devil doesn't he?
[1:14:36.080 --> 1:14:40.760]  He's a little devil.
[1:14:40.760 --> 1:14:47.400]  My dream is still to live underneath the caliphate, underneath the Islamic law, that's my dream.
[1:14:47.400 --> 1:14:49.400]  And they let him back here?
[1:14:49.400 --> 1:14:50.400]  In Europe?
[1:14:50.400 --> 1:14:51.400]  Yes.
[1:14:51.400 --> 1:14:52.400]  There will be a day.
[1:14:52.400 --> 1:14:54.080]  There will be a day, yes, when it's Islamic gold.
[1:14:54.080 --> 1:14:57.400]  You think sooner or later they'll make it to Europe?
[1:14:57.400 --> 1:15:02.760]  I think they're already in Europe because ISIS is not a group, it's an ideology.
[1:15:02.760 --> 1:15:09.080]  He thinks he's so tough, like it's so mysterious to be part of such an evil cowardly group.
[1:15:09.080 --> 1:15:13.040]  And all over Europe, the Swedes you name it, bring them back in and give them psychological
[1:15:13.040 --> 1:15:17.600]  counseling and welfare because they were in ISIS and then still let them operate and put
[1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:22.540]  them on the news and what do you want about trendy liberal 18-year-old women, text him
[1:15:22.540 --> 1:15:24.400]  and want to hang out with him.
[1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:28.040]  Just like they want to get picked up by a pimp and used and have cigarettes put out on their
[1:15:28.040 --> 1:15:29.040]  eyeballs.
[1:15:29.040 --> 1:15:30.040]  They love it.
[1:15:30.040 --> 1:15:36.080]  Dr. Manning joins us from Ottla, A-T-L-A-H dot O-R-G.
[1:15:36.080 --> 1:15:41.120]  He spearheaded the boycott nationwide to get Al Sharpton kicked off MSNBC.
[1:15:41.120 --> 1:15:43.880]  He is in the face of the dragon.
[1:15:43.880 --> 1:15:46.040]  He's got the eye of the tiger, doesn't need to be introduced here.
[1:15:46.040 --> 1:15:50.560]  I appreciate him holding while I was ranting, but I am particularly getting wound up now
[1:15:50.560 --> 1:15:55.960]  because this is just crazy, Ottla dot O-R-G, Pastor Manning, thank you so much for coming
[1:15:55.960 --> 1:15:58.240]  on to give us your commentary and your analysis.
[1:15:58.240 --> 1:16:01.520]  You heard me ranting there, but this is real anger.
[1:16:01.520 --> 1:16:07.240]  This is getting so crazy where there are resting people that mildly criticize Islam, not just
[1:16:07.240 --> 1:16:08.560]  in Europe, but here.
[1:16:08.560 --> 1:16:10.840]  I want to ask you, who is the left?
[1:16:10.840 --> 1:16:15.680]  Who are these people that would take the countries that have given them so much freedom
[1:16:15.680 --> 1:16:21.080]  and then try to bring in the most radical forms of Islam that would literally murder
[1:16:21.080 --> 1:16:22.080]  them?
[1:16:22.080 --> 1:16:24.240]  Well, Alex, there are a couple of things about it.
[1:16:24.240 --> 1:16:25.800]  We thank you so very much for having me.
[1:16:25.800 --> 1:16:28.920]  It's always a great honor to share on your broadcast.
[1:16:28.920 --> 1:16:29.920]  There are a couple of things.
[1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:34.760]  One, to your earlier point, regarding the language that you, I mean, you've been broadcasting
[1:16:34.760 --> 1:16:39.000]  for 21 years and we know that your language is always upscale.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:43.280]  But with respect to what's happening now, especially with this transgender sexual ideology
[1:16:43.280 --> 1:16:49.040]  that's going on, they are counting on you using wimpy, if you will, politically correct
[1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:53.280]  language that they might be able to continue to advance their calls.
[1:16:53.280 --> 1:16:59.920]  So, your language, if you don't get salty, you're going to get slaughtered by the politically
[1:16:59.920 --> 1:17:00.920]  correct crowd.
[1:17:00.920 --> 1:17:06.880]  The other thing is that you made mention of in your rant, first of all, Islam is the
[1:17:06.880 --> 1:17:13.080]  biggest con game in terms of getting people to go out to fight that I've ever heard of.
[1:17:13.080 --> 1:17:15.840]  You get promised 70 virgins in paradise.
[1:17:15.840 --> 1:17:22.760]  If you get killed, if there's a con game of con games, that is the most unique of all
[1:17:22.760 --> 1:17:29.600]  con games, and yet it is pervasive among a billion people who believe that con game.
[1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:31.640]  And so they go out and they do all of this fighting.
[1:17:31.640 --> 1:17:38.400]  But I think the other thing, Alex, with respect to what the view is going to say about Trump
[1:17:38.400 --> 1:17:46.000]  and about Brussels, what's happening there today, you know, I have this desire to look
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:52.600]  further and deeper into why is it that a city like Brussels or Paris, if you're looking
[1:17:52.600 --> 1:17:57.000]  at these reasons, why are they hitting the places that literally roll out a red carpet
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  to them?
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:00.920]  Yeah, well, I mean, there has to be another answer other than what we're getting from
[1:18:00.920 --> 1:18:02.480]  the dung head media, Alex.
[1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:04.160]  I mean, I don't believe them.
[1:18:04.160 --> 1:18:07.360]  And we're going to have to look deeper and perhaps you will have, you know, just looking
[1:18:07.360 --> 1:18:11.440]  closer at this would have a better answer, because it doesn't make sense.
[1:18:11.440 --> 1:18:15.880]  They're not hitting an organization or states or nations that are hostile to them in many
[1:18:15.880 --> 1:18:16.880]  ways.
[1:18:16.880 --> 1:18:22.240]  I mean, you, you go to Paris and France or in Belgium as a Muslim and you get treated
[1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:29.600]  like, I mean, royally, they roll out the red carpet, so why is this happening here rather
[1:18:29.600 --> 1:18:34.520]  than some other nation, perhaps, where we might be a little bit more adverse to Islamic
[1:18:34.520 --> 1:18:36.800]  thought or ISIS in general?
[1:18:36.800 --> 1:18:40.320]  I don't understand it, but I don't believe what I'm saying on the dung head media.
[1:18:40.320 --> 1:18:41.320]  I just don't.
[1:18:41.320 --> 1:18:42.960]  So there's something else behind this.
[1:18:42.960 --> 1:18:46.760]  Well, clearly, I've talked to a lot of insiders and others and they say they're bringing them
[1:18:46.760 --> 1:18:52.120]  into attack, then they're going to make Christians and others control our speech as not upset
[1:18:52.120 --> 1:18:56.720]  the Muslims and they're also going to use it to roll out a police state against everybody.
[1:18:56.720 --> 1:18:57.720]  I don't know.
[1:18:57.720 --> 1:18:59.160]  I mean, that's, that's a possibility.
[1:18:59.160 --> 1:19:03.800]  I'm not sure that that is the ultimate, but there's something going on with the powers
[1:19:03.800 --> 1:19:08.680]  that be the, the world order that wants to control everything.
[1:19:08.680 --> 1:19:15.560]  And I think they see ISIS, Islam rather as a vehicle through which they can either use
[1:19:15.560 --> 1:19:18.680]  them as a stepping stone to do more world control.
[1:19:18.680 --> 1:19:21.240]  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not sure.
[1:19:21.240 --> 1:19:27.080]  There could be some adverse thoughts to the nonproductive state of a state like Brussels
[1:19:27.080 --> 1:19:32.960]  or Belgium, for instance, or in Paris, there is, there's no love of Jesus that the Parisians
[1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:34.960]  are without God.
[1:19:34.960 --> 1:19:39.920]  They're pretty much a godless people with a liberal mindset as far worse than anything
[1:19:39.920 --> 1:19:42.040]  that we can experience here.
[1:19:42.040 --> 1:19:47.320]  I mean, you know, 9 11 appointed everybody to hate Muslims.
[1:19:47.320 --> 1:19:49.000]  It changed the entire world order.
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:53.880]  I mean, if we were just to talk about, let's say for instance, a security firm, a Bill
[1:19:53.880 --> 1:20:00.120]  Gates type who writes patterns and programs for security said, listen, let's knock down
[1:20:00.120 --> 1:20:05.560]  the world trade center and everybody in their brother worldwide will have to spend billions
[1:20:05.560 --> 1:20:11.600]  of dollars in new security ideas, new security techniques that will be implemented and you
[1:20:11.600 --> 1:20:14.120]  make a billion, you make a zillion dollars.
[1:20:14.120 --> 1:20:19.120]  You're right, it created a whole new economy based on select groups controlling the rollout
[1:20:19.120 --> 1:20:20.680]  of the technocracy.
[1:20:20.680 --> 1:20:21.680]  Right.
[1:20:21.680 --> 1:20:27.880]  So, I mean, what's behind what's happening in Belgium and in France, I don't believe
[1:20:27.880 --> 1:20:32.280]  it's just Muslims want to force the Koran and get people to say Allah Akbar.
[1:20:32.280 --> 1:20:33.360]  Oh, I agree with you.
[1:20:33.360 --> 1:20:34.960]  I was against the earlier wars.
[1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:38.600]  I would be against quote Islamophobia, just hate Muslims.
[1:20:38.600 --> 1:20:42.960]  But clearly they're putting the most radical in charge Saudi Arabia is allowing to bring
[1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:43.960]  them in.
[1:20:43.960 --> 1:20:48.880]  They're killing people and the left is defending it and acting like Donald Trump is to blame.
[1:20:48.880 --> 1:20:49.880]  That's where I get so angry.
[1:20:49.880 --> 1:20:54.360]  So, I agree, it's a lot bigger than just getting upset with the radical Islamist, but I think
[1:20:54.360 --> 1:20:58.240]  at the end of the day, the globalist admit they want to clash the civilizations in their
[1:20:58.240 --> 1:21:04.160]  own PNAC documents and out of the clash between the dying decadent West and radical Islam,
[1:21:04.160 --> 1:21:08.640]  a world government will come in to basically referee and arbitrate.
[1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:10.760]  Well, you know, let me be clear.
[1:21:10.760 --> 1:21:14.200]  I'm not here in support of Islam in any way, shape, form or fashion.
[1:21:14.200 --> 1:21:16.080]  I think they are a barbaric group.
[1:21:16.080 --> 1:21:21.160]  They were prophesied to be so, but hey, God's birth of Ishmael way back there during the
[1:21:21.160 --> 1:21:22.160]  days of Abraham.
[1:21:22.160 --> 1:21:23.560]  I want to be clear about that.
[1:21:23.560 --> 1:21:29.840]  But I think your phrase just a few moments ago of a dying decadent West, perhaps there
[1:21:29.840 --> 1:21:33.680]  is some sort of a new regeneration that they're trying to put forward.
[1:21:33.680 --> 1:21:34.680]  I'm not sure.
[1:21:34.680 --> 1:21:36.000]  I just don't believe the rhetoric.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  I agree.
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:43.320]  I've looked at that allowing these outrages by radical Islam could spark a rebirth of
[1:21:43.320 --> 1:21:46.080]  Western values and appreciation of liberty and freedom.
[1:21:46.080 --> 1:21:49.240]  But then I look at what the political correct people are doing.
[1:21:49.240 --> 1:21:50.800]  They really want to get rid of free speech.
[1:21:50.800 --> 1:21:55.680]  I just think I think the left is degenerated into pure evil and their ally with radical
[1:21:55.680 --> 1:21:57.920]  Islam because they hate bitter clingers.
[1:21:57.920 --> 1:22:03.800]  Listen, if you let's look at a group like Black Lives Matter, for instance, I mean,
[1:22:03.800 --> 1:22:08.640]  you would think after the alleged black president who really isn't black, but okay, everybody's
[1:22:08.640 --> 1:22:15.480]  said so, and Barack Hussein Obama, that the political movement, especially among black
[1:22:15.480 --> 1:22:21.080]  people under what have been taught by Dr. King, would advance into a different approach
[1:22:21.080 --> 1:22:24.720]  to dealing with social or political ideas or elections.
[1:22:24.720 --> 1:22:33.720]  Here we got a radical group, just a grade below ISIS or Islam storming campaigns, taking
[1:22:33.720 --> 1:22:36.920]  it, going in and creating all kinds of havoc.
[1:22:36.920 --> 1:22:44.040]  But the other thing, then giving to black people in general, Alex, a blanket, if you
[1:22:44.040 --> 1:22:49.600]  will, view that all black people are radical, just one step short of being black panthers,
[1:22:49.600 --> 1:22:55.480]  Black Lives Matter, which was absolutely unnecessary for them to approach political
[1:22:55.480 --> 1:22:56.480]  policy.
[1:22:56.480 --> 1:23:00.160]  They'll definitely be a backlash now by dumbed down racist white people against innocent
[1:23:00.160 --> 1:23:01.160]  black people.
[1:23:01.160 --> 1:23:02.160]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:07.280]  I mean, I see the ISIS thing and the Black Lives Matter sort of got kind of compatible.
[1:23:07.280 --> 1:23:10.160]  You're seeing the dialectic of problem reaction solution.
[1:23:10.160 --> 1:23:11.160]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:23:11.160 --> 1:23:12.160]  Absolutely.
[1:23:12.160 --> 1:23:17.480]  So, you know, what is really going on behind this?
[1:23:17.480 --> 1:23:22.960]  It isn't just the fact that ISIS or Muslims want to take charge of territory.
[1:23:22.960 --> 1:23:26.320]  Listen, Saudi Arabia's got tons and tons and tons of money.
[1:23:26.320 --> 1:23:30.680]  George Bush was in the pocket of King Abdullah, and so is Obama.
[1:23:30.680 --> 1:23:35.040]  So, I mean, they don't need to be militant and to kill a whole bunch of people to get
[1:23:35.040 --> 1:23:36.040]  their way.
[1:23:36.040 --> 1:23:40.720]  They can buy their way or bribe their way into the lives of politicians and do what
[1:23:40.720 --> 1:23:41.720]  they want to do.
[1:23:41.720 --> 1:23:45.600]  I'm just highly suspicious of what's going on, and wish I had a better answer for your
[1:23:45.600 --> 1:23:46.600]  audience today.
[1:23:46.600 --> 1:23:49.760]  Well, I think you had a better answer because you just laid out, I wasn't even thinking
[1:23:49.760 --> 1:23:52.720]  about the Galilean dialectic and all that, and then there you are laying it out in its
[1:23:52.720 --> 1:23:53.720]  prima facia.
[1:23:53.720 --> 1:23:56.320]  You know, it's true on the surface.
[1:23:56.320 --> 1:24:03.080]  Obama doesn't even lean down when he meets a Christian leader, and he shouldn't, by the
[1:24:03.080 --> 1:24:04.400]  way, because he's ahead of state.
[1:24:04.400 --> 1:24:09.400]  But he does bow down to any Muslim leader he finds or foreign royalty.
[1:24:09.400 --> 1:24:10.400]  That is disgusting.
[1:24:10.400 --> 1:24:12.120]  What do you think that's about?
[1:24:12.120 --> 1:24:16.320]  I think it's about simply what's in his heart.
[1:24:16.320 --> 1:24:20.040]  As a man, think of it in his heart, so is he.
[1:24:20.040 --> 1:24:25.320]  You have reverence for certain principles, Alex, I've known you over the years, and
[1:24:25.320 --> 1:24:29.400]  you could hear the change in your voice when there comes to various patriotic reverences
[1:24:29.400 --> 1:24:34.840]  and also the sternness in your voice, and the clarity and resolve when you talk about
[1:24:34.840 --> 1:24:35.840]  the globalist.
[1:24:35.840 --> 1:24:41.840]  I mean, your voice changes as an attitude that these people are dangerous, they're diabolical,
[1:24:41.840 --> 1:24:46.000]  and don't mistake my voice, or mistake what I'm saying.
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:52.640]  So when Obama comes in contact with the Muslims and others, his heart tells him to bow down
[1:24:52.640 --> 1:24:53.640]  to this power.
[1:24:53.640 --> 1:24:57.720]  Well, he's so sweet to him, and then every Easter, he badmouthed Christians and said,
[1:24:57.720 --> 1:25:00.400]  remember last year, and says, we're mean and hateful.
[1:25:00.400 --> 1:25:07.880]  Well, you know, the funeral of Judge Justice Scalia was not attended by the Mac Daddy Obama.
[1:25:07.880 --> 1:25:09.240]  He didn't go.
[1:25:09.240 --> 1:25:15.280]  And one of my audience participants said the reason why he did not go is because it was
[1:25:15.280 --> 1:25:16.280]  in the Catholic Church.
[1:25:16.280 --> 1:25:20.360]  You know, the Catholics are heavy on biblical symbolism.
[1:25:20.360 --> 1:25:25.280]  They've got the cross and Jesus all over everywhere in their sanctuaries.
[1:25:25.280 --> 1:25:32.400]  And when Obama in his first year of office spoke at Notre Dame and also at George Weston
[1:25:32.400 --> 1:25:37.760]  University there in Washington, DC, if I'm pronouncing the university correct, he made
[1:25:37.760 --> 1:25:43.280]  them cover up the picture of Jesus and cover up the cross at Notre Dame and also at the
[1:25:43.280 --> 1:25:44.280]  university.
[1:25:44.280 --> 1:25:49.600]  But he couldn't get the Catholics to do that at Scalia's funeral, so he didn't go.
[1:25:49.600 --> 1:25:50.600]  That's his.
[1:25:50.600 --> 1:25:51.600]  You're right.
[1:25:51.600 --> 1:25:52.600]  He bashes Christians.
[1:25:52.600 --> 1:25:56.920]  Well, it's almost like a vampire because I forgot he'll never be seen with a cross
[1:25:56.920 --> 1:25:57.920]  around him.
[1:25:57.920 --> 1:25:58.920]  What is it?
[1:25:58.920 --> 1:25:59.920]  He's a vampire.
[1:25:59.920 --> 1:26:00.920]  He's a vampire.
[1:26:00.920 --> 1:26:01.920]  He will not.
[1:26:01.920 --> 1:26:13.000]  I mean, a cross will actually bring him to his knees, so he has it covered up.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:17.680]  I was so put out when Notre Dame did that going back, you remember when he did that
[1:26:17.680 --> 1:26:21.280]  happen going back a year ago, not a year ago, but several years ago.
[1:26:21.280 --> 1:26:22.680]  I forgot about that.
[1:26:22.680 --> 1:26:23.680]  No.
[1:26:23.680 --> 1:26:27.960]  And Dr. Alan Keyes was out there on his knees begging people to wake up to what's going
[1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:32.440]  on that you got to cover up the cross of Jesus to get this low light piece of trash
[1:26:32.440 --> 1:26:37.040]  called Obama to come and speak at one of the Catholics most leading in the notorious
[1:26:37.040 --> 1:26:38.040]  organized schools.
[1:26:38.040 --> 1:26:39.040]  That's crazy.
[1:26:39.040 --> 1:26:42.680]  Because when he goes to India or anywhere else, he will stand in front of any other
[1:26:42.680 --> 1:26:47.800]  religious symbol but the cross and they do cover it up everywhere.
[1:26:47.800 --> 1:26:48.800]  Wow.
[1:26:48.800 --> 1:26:52.320]  That is such a message that he doesn't want to be seen worldwide with that image associated
[1:26:52.320 --> 1:26:53.320]  with him.
[1:26:53.320 --> 1:26:54.820]  That is unbelievable.
[1:26:54.820 --> 1:26:58.280]  What are we going to do about Christians in America that allow that to take place who
[1:26:58.280 --> 1:27:06.320]  feel a coward rather into allowing him to do that hands of tide were just helpless.
[1:27:06.320 --> 1:27:12.480]  Must preach the speech freedom of religion means that separation of church and state
[1:27:12.480 --> 1:27:15.160]  means that as Christians, we shouldn't challenge him.
[1:27:15.160 --> 1:27:20.480]  I was about to say I've never worn jewelry other than a watch, but I'm I just feel moved
[1:27:20.480 --> 1:27:24.520]  the last year or so to get a small cross and start running around my neck just because
[1:27:24.520 --> 1:27:25.920]  the enemy hates it so much.
[1:27:25.920 --> 1:27:28.920]  Why does the enemy hate that symbol so much?
[1:27:28.920 --> 1:27:33.480]  Because it's the most powerful symbol in all of the known universe.
[1:27:33.480 --> 1:27:38.960]  You can go from planet to planet, from star to star, from galaxy to galaxy and the cross
[1:27:38.960 --> 1:27:39.960]  is it, Alex.
[1:27:39.960 --> 1:27:40.960]  It's it.
[1:27:40.960 --> 1:27:41.960]  I got one right here.
[1:27:41.960 --> 1:27:42.960]  Can y'all see it?
[1:27:42.960 --> 1:27:43.960]  Hey, look here.
[1:27:43.960 --> 1:27:44.960]  I got it right here.
[1:27:44.960 --> 1:27:45.960]  I'm wearing a cross right here.
[1:27:45.960 --> 1:27:49.280]  It's on a little chain on my vest, but I'm wearing it.
[1:27:49.280 --> 1:27:50.880]  Alex, go get one.
[1:27:50.880 --> 1:27:51.880]  It's power.
[1:27:51.880 --> 1:27:54.120]  I like to see Obama.
[1:27:54.120 --> 1:27:56.320]  If I first thing I do, I'd flash him.
[1:27:56.320 --> 1:27:58.160]  I'd have my jacket closed, you know.
[1:27:58.160 --> 1:28:02.120]  If I came into his presence, I'd have my jacket closed.
[1:28:02.120 --> 1:28:04.480]  Then when I came up to him, I'd flash over my cross.
[1:28:04.480 --> 1:28:08.040]  Well, I've talked to people about how the flies are always landing on him.
[1:28:08.040 --> 1:28:10.840]  People leave it inside the White House and I talked to another prominent person and they
[1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:14.200]  said, no, there's something really evil about Obama when you're in his presence.
[1:28:14.200 --> 1:28:15.840]  Have you ever been in his presence?
[1:28:15.840 --> 1:28:16.840]  No, never.
[1:28:16.840 --> 1:28:17.840]  No.
[1:28:17.840 --> 1:28:20.080]  I boycotted him when he came to Harlem.
[1:28:20.080 --> 1:28:24.880]  I was just a door or two away from him across the street when he came to Harlem at the Red
[1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:25.880]  Rooster.
[1:28:25.880 --> 1:28:26.880]  I let a boycott.
[1:28:26.880 --> 1:28:30.520]  Our church is out there in mass numbers boycotting him, but that's the closest I've ever been
[1:28:30.520 --> 1:28:32.080]  to the creep.
[1:28:32.080 --> 1:28:33.160]  I want to go to break.
[1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:34.160]  I want to come back.
[1:28:34.160 --> 1:28:36.800]  The toll-free number to join us because callers always bring up great issues that I wouldn't
[1:28:36.800 --> 1:28:37.800]  bring up.
[1:28:37.800 --> 1:28:38.800]  800-259-9231.
[1:28:38.800 --> 1:28:39.800]  800-2599-231.
[1:28:39.800 --> 1:28:44.480]  Pastor Manning is a great guy.
[1:28:44.480 --> 1:28:48.320]  He doesn't ask me to do this, but people like him that come on, I ask the listeners to check
[1:28:48.320 --> 1:28:49.320]  out his ministry.
[1:28:49.320 --> 1:28:54.280]  That'd be a great place in my view to tithe and support people if you only have globalist
[1:28:54.280 --> 1:28:55.920]  churches in your area.
[1:28:55.920 --> 1:28:59.600]  He feeds the local folks, teaches them about what's happening with the New World Order.
[1:28:59.600 --> 1:29:03.320]  He really is the type of church I would attend if I lived near to him.
[1:29:03.320 --> 1:29:08.880]  Otla.org, great videos, great reports, great TV show, radio show, great materials for
[1:29:08.880 --> 1:29:10.640]  everybody free there on the site.
[1:29:10.640 --> 1:29:15.720]  But Otla.org, he's been through a lot in Harlem over 30 years fighting and has now become
[1:29:15.720 --> 1:29:20.520]  a major leader in the area by being willing to go up against gangsters like Al Sharpton.
[1:29:20.520 --> 1:29:22.800]  So he's a good friend and a great patriot.
[1:29:22.800 --> 1:29:25.800]  Pastor James at David Manning, Otla.org.
[1:29:25.800 --> 1:29:26.800]  I'm Alex Schoen, your host.
[1:29:26.800 --> 1:29:32.760]  I want to get into the Trump phenomenon, the economy, geopolitics and a lot more and the
[1:29:32.760 --> 1:29:36.280]  real meaning of Easter because I started just thinking about Obama just now.
[1:29:36.280 --> 1:29:39.720]  He'll never be seen with a cross, he badmouthed Christianity on Easter.
[1:29:39.720 --> 1:29:42.440]  I mean, why does he hate it so much?
[1:29:42.440 --> 1:29:44.560]  Why not act like he just likes it?
[1:29:44.560 --> 1:29:46.000]  What is the problem there?
[1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:48.440]  That tells you everything, doesn't it?
[1:29:48.440 --> 1:29:49.720]  We're on the march.
[1:29:49.720 --> 1:30:05.520]  The left-leaning women from the popular daytime TV show, The View, are finally starting to
[1:30:05.520 --> 1:30:12.720]  admit that they agree with Donald Trump on his foreign policy and views on ISIS.
[1:30:12.720 --> 1:30:15.160]  I thought Donald Trump sounded really reasonable today.
[1:30:15.160 --> 1:30:17.160]  My law enforcement background kicked in.
[1:30:17.160 --> 1:30:18.160]  What?
[1:30:18.160 --> 1:30:19.160]  What?
[1:30:19.160 --> 1:30:20.960]  We need to be forceful.
[1:30:20.960 --> 1:30:24.360]  We can't have these muted responses to terror.
[1:30:24.360 --> 1:30:26.560]  And let me also say this about Donald Trump.
[1:30:26.560 --> 1:30:29.040]  We trash him often here.
[1:30:29.040 --> 1:30:34.800]  Bottom line is in January, and you've been saying that, Raven, in January of this year,
[1:30:34.800 --> 1:30:36.960]  he said Brussels was a hellhole.
[1:30:36.960 --> 1:30:41.080]  He said there is something going on, Maria, and it is not good talking about Belgium.
[1:30:41.080 --> 1:30:42.080]  He was right.
[1:30:42.080 --> 1:30:43.080]  So he's right on a couple of things.
[1:30:43.080 --> 1:30:45.600]  So his foreign policy isn't so outrageous.
[1:30:45.600 --> 1:30:50.720]  So is Donald Trump really the voice of reason, and which candidate makes you feel safer?
[1:30:50.720 --> 1:30:53.440]  Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton?
[1:30:53.440 --> 1:30:59.200]  Let us know what you think in the comment section right now at Infowars.com.
[1:30:59.200 --> 1:31:02.480]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[1:31:57.840 --> 1:32:04.960]  Yeah, first of all, I want to say, take the 12-actin-2 SuperMail Brain Force Prostagart
[1:32:04.960 --> 1:32:06.720]  Silver Bull, and I use them all.
[1:32:06.720 --> 1:32:07.720]  They're phenomenal.
[1:32:07.720 --> 1:32:08.720]  They work.
[1:32:08.720 --> 1:32:09.720]  Thank you, brother.
[1:32:09.720 --> 1:32:11.800]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[1:32:11.800 --> 1:32:17.520]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine
[1:32:17.520 --> 1:32:18.520]  products.
[1:32:18.520 --> 1:32:19.520]  Welcome to the Infowar.
[1:32:19.520 --> 1:32:24.600]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the Infowar at
[1:32:24.600 --> 1:32:25.600]  the same time.
[1:32:25.600 --> 1:32:26.600]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[1:32:26.600 --> 1:32:30.080]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, Casio FX, Nacinot, and I.
[1:32:30.080 --> 1:32:31.200]  Right, let me ask you a question.
[1:32:31.200 --> 1:32:32.200]  Have they worked for you?
[1:32:32.200 --> 1:32:35.120]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[1:32:35.120 --> 1:32:36.120]  What products are you taking?
[1:32:36.120 --> 1:32:37.120]  Are you taking?
[1:32:37.120 --> 1:32:42.600]  I'm taking from SuperMail to Brain Force to Winterson, X2.
[1:32:42.600 --> 1:32:47.560]  Even got a little DNA force, so when I just re-upped everything and I just went to Auto
[1:32:47.560 --> 1:32:48.560]  Built.

[1:33:10.240 --> 1:33:35.040]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:40.240 --> 1:33:49.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back broadcasting worldwide.
[1:33:49.320 --> 1:33:51.440]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[1:33:51.440 --> 1:33:55.240]  Pastor David J. Manning is our guest, or James David Manning is our guest.
[1:33:55.240 --> 1:33:56.240]  My dad's name's David.
[1:33:56.240 --> 1:34:02.080]  I tell you, my head is spinning right now because I know I start hyperventilating.
[1:34:02.080 --> 1:34:06.680]  It's just when you study the news all day and you look at what these people are doing
[1:34:06.680 --> 1:34:08.600]  and you start making the connections.
[1:34:08.600 --> 1:34:15.240]  I'd forgotten that just last month he wouldn't be seen with the crosses and with images of
[1:34:15.240 --> 1:34:18.400]  Christ and other Christian iconography.
[1:34:18.400 --> 1:34:22.400]  I forgot that they've actually made them, when he gives speeches at churches, cover
[1:34:22.400 --> 1:34:23.400]  it up.
[1:34:23.400 --> 1:34:28.800]  And I forgot that the Methodist Church has always been, quote, liberal, but like abolitionist
[1:34:28.800 --> 1:34:33.320]  liberal in a good way, and I've got family that's some family that's Baptist, others
[1:34:33.320 --> 1:34:37.720]  that are Methodist, and they can't even go to their Methodist churches anymore, including
[1:34:37.720 --> 1:34:42.200]  the biggest one here in town because let me tell you, they get up there and they're talking
[1:34:42.200 --> 1:34:46.040]  about all over the country taking crosses out.
[1:34:46.040 --> 1:34:48.840]  Germany's doing it too saying, it's hurtful to those that aren't Christian.
[1:34:48.840 --> 1:34:51.800]  Well, then you're not a church anymore.
[1:34:51.800 --> 1:34:55.120]  So that's what this move is about.
[1:34:55.120 --> 1:34:58.320]  Everybody else's symbols can be there, but Christians.
[1:34:58.320 --> 1:34:59.320]  This is so discriminatory.
[1:34:59.320 --> 1:35:01.320]  We're going to go back to Pastor Manning.
[1:35:01.320 --> 1:35:05.080]  In a moment we got David and Doug and Mike and Robert and many others that are patiently
[1:35:05.080 --> 1:35:13.240]  holding the number to join us on this live Thursday edition is 800-259-9231.
[1:35:13.240 --> 1:35:17.800]  But as they attempt to intimidate free speech, it's time to take action.
[1:35:17.800 --> 1:35:23.520]  Lord Moncton said he didn't used to wear a big cross until they started trying to restrict
[1:35:23.520 --> 1:35:26.600]  him and said, don't wear him in England and the UK on the news.
[1:35:26.600 --> 1:35:27.600]  They said they're hurtful.
[1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:30.040]  He wears a giant one now.
[1:35:30.040 --> 1:35:34.960]  But you know what, I just thought of it, I'm going to put out a t-shirt that's basically
[1:35:34.960 --> 1:35:40.760]  crusader style with a big shield and a big cross with something like defending free
[1:35:40.760 --> 1:35:47.840]  speech since 13-something because it was Islam that invaded Europe dozens of times, killed
[1:35:47.840 --> 1:35:51.000]  millions till the crusades responded to push it out.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:56.200]  And I was taught in school and college that the West was bad in the crusades, even though
[1:35:56.200 --> 1:36:01.880]  the very textbook admitted that Islam started expanding before Muhammad even died.
[1:36:01.880 --> 1:36:05.480]  It had taken over thousands of miles.
[1:36:05.480 --> 1:36:08.880]  So I mean, I'm just, it's crazy.
[1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:19.280]  It's crazy to sit there and blame groups that didn't do anything for things that happened
[1:36:19.280 --> 1:36:20.280]  in history.
[1:36:20.280 --> 1:36:21.280]  It just shows the attack on reality.
[1:36:21.280 --> 1:36:24.120]  It's like blaming Donald Trump for saying we're not vetting any of the people coming
[1:36:24.120 --> 1:36:25.120]  in from the Middle East.
[1:36:25.120 --> 1:36:27.520]  We'll block them all till we vet them.
[1:36:27.520 --> 1:36:29.040]  Before that, he's like, well, we've got to bring the Christians in.
[1:36:29.040 --> 1:36:30.040]  They're being killed.
[1:36:30.040 --> 1:36:31.040]  No, sir.
[1:36:31.040 --> 1:36:34.320]  They're not letting the Christians come out for every couple of hundred Muslims.
[1:36:34.320 --> 1:36:35.320]  They'll let one Christian in.
[1:36:35.320 --> 1:36:36.320]  That's in the news.
[1:36:36.320 --> 1:36:40.760]  They won't let Shiites in because they're not allied with Obama.
[1:36:40.760 --> 1:36:41.760]  It's crazy.
[1:36:41.760 --> 1:36:45.680]  We're going back to our guest, back to the news, and then your phone calls, but briefly,
[1:36:45.680 --> 1:36:47.560]  it's important to exercise the First Amendment.
[1:36:47.560 --> 1:36:50.880]  We sold out, of course, the limited edition Hillary for present t-shirt, but now we have
[1:36:50.880 --> 1:36:52.880]  a new limited edition.
[1:36:52.880 --> 1:36:57.800]  It looks like a campaign shirt, Hillary for present, 2016 and beyond.
[1:36:57.800 --> 1:37:06.560]  She's tried to call up to different major comedy groups and others and comedy clubs
[1:37:06.560 --> 1:37:09.280]  and said, you can't criticize me or I'll have your license revoked.
[1:37:09.280 --> 1:37:11.240]  We have to exercise the First Amendment or lose it.
[1:37:11.240 --> 1:37:14.880]  A little bit of money we make when we sell each t-shirt is vital to run this operation.
[1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:17.680]  It's like Trump funded his campaign with ball caps and t-shirts.
[1:37:17.680 --> 1:37:19.840]  It takes a lot of them to fund the operation.
[1:37:19.840 --> 1:37:24.520]  So infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com to find the nutraceuticals.
[1:37:24.520 --> 1:37:26.520]  We have 10% off the deep cleanse.
[1:37:26.520 --> 1:37:32.360]  It's a whole bunch of zeolites and other known compounds that pull out toxins from the body
[1:37:32.360 --> 1:37:36.040]  and massively detoxifies.
[1:37:36.040 --> 1:37:40.480]  And the highest quality shilligy, you know, government and others criticize shilligy because
[1:37:40.480 --> 1:37:42.240]  it's so incredible.
[1:37:42.240 --> 1:37:43.240]  It's just amazing.
[1:37:43.240 --> 1:37:46.360]  Research, it's the highest quality shilligy, pulls out the toxins.
[1:37:46.360 --> 1:37:49.800]  It's what the Russians, one of their secrets in the Olympics, it's legal and lawful.
[1:37:49.800 --> 1:37:50.960]  Find out about it.
[1:37:50.960 --> 1:37:51.960]  It's so amazing.
[1:37:51.960 --> 1:37:54.280]  You can just put this in your water under your tongue every day.
[1:37:54.280 --> 1:37:56.720]  The detox is amazing, 10% off that.
[1:37:56.720 --> 1:38:00.120]  Get it with the liver cleanse, you can also just put it in water by itself and not do
[1:38:00.120 --> 1:38:01.120]  the intense cleanse.
[1:38:01.120 --> 1:38:02.560]  That's what a lot of folks do.
[1:38:02.560 --> 1:38:05.800]  And it works synergistically together, 15% off when you get the two together, or get
[1:38:05.800 --> 1:38:10.320]  it with oxy powder, all three together, and get 20% off when you get the ultimate cleanse
[1:38:10.320 --> 1:38:15.960]  pack at infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com or by calling toll three, we can answer all
[1:38:15.960 --> 1:38:20.160]  your questions, 888-253-3139.
[1:38:20.160 --> 1:38:23.120]  And I want to thank you all for your support.
[1:38:23.120 --> 1:38:25.000]  Thank you all for your prayers.
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:28.680]  Thank you all for spreading the word, because I know I'm hard to put up with sometimes,
[1:38:28.680 --> 1:38:30.200]  but people know my heart's in the right place.
[1:38:30.200 --> 1:38:34.040]  And when I have these guests, Pastor Manning's never asked me to plug his website or plug
[1:38:34.040 --> 1:38:35.040]  his ministry.
[1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:39.120]  I just know from local news and follow him for a decade, the type of good work he does.
[1:38:39.120 --> 1:38:43.840]  When I say please support him if you can, or you find it in your heart, or support us,
[1:38:43.840 --> 1:38:44.840]  we're trying to support you.
[1:38:44.840 --> 1:38:46.480]  I'm not complaining if you don't support us.
[1:38:46.480 --> 1:38:48.800]  I know how poor people are under this depression.
[1:38:48.800 --> 1:38:53.240]  They want to make us poor in their own documents with Cloward and Piven and others, so that
[1:38:53.240 --> 1:38:56.840]  the West is so broken, we're busy just trying to get food every day.
[1:38:56.840 --> 1:38:59.080]  They want to make us poor as a tool of control.
[1:38:59.080 --> 1:39:02.560]  That's why the globalists want to bankrupt us with socialism and communism, because
[1:39:02.560 --> 1:39:04.280]  they can't compete with free market.
[1:39:04.280 --> 1:39:07.960]  And that's just a fact, but our kids are so dumbed down, many of them, they don't know
[1:39:07.960 --> 1:39:09.840]  that at these colleges.
[1:39:09.840 --> 1:39:14.240]  Because the big robber barons like Bill Gates don't want them to know how successful they
[1:39:14.240 --> 1:39:15.240]  could be.
[1:39:15.240 --> 1:39:19.600]  The globalists are in competition with competition, as John D. Rockefeller said, competition is
[1:39:19.600 --> 1:39:20.600]  a sin.
[1:39:20.600 --> 1:39:21.600]  Look it up for yourself.
[1:39:21.600 --> 1:39:26.240]  So whether it's spreading the word about the broadcast, supporting our local affiliates,
[1:39:26.240 --> 1:39:31.080]  supporting their local sponsors, becoming a sponsor locally, praying for us, sending
[1:39:31.080 --> 1:39:35.040]  out the video links, the story links, whatever the case is, it's all having a giant effect
[1:39:35.040 --> 1:39:36.040]  and God bless you.
[1:39:36.040 --> 1:39:39.880]  But our audience is metrically more than doubling every year.
[1:39:39.880 --> 1:39:44.320]  All about five years ago, as audience went up, money went up.
[1:39:44.320 --> 1:39:48.320]  We're in such a recession slash depression that audience doubles, triples, quadruples
[1:39:48.320 --> 1:39:51.360]  now in a year, money doesn't go up.
[1:39:51.360 --> 1:39:54.520]  So I know for people like Manning, without asking him, I bet it's tough, even though
[1:39:54.520 --> 1:39:59.520]  his audience is explode, because this country and this world's in trouble, folks, and that's
[1:39:59.520 --> 1:40:04.200]  why we're pulling to turn our jobs back on, pulling to turn our factories back on, pulling
[1:40:04.200 --> 1:40:09.280]  to not shut down the coal power plants, they're totally clean, and our power prices have doubled.
[1:40:09.280 --> 1:40:12.560]  That's why we're pulling for Trump, because we want to make America free and great again.
[1:40:12.560 --> 1:40:19.080]  So infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or a-t-l-a-h dot o-r-g, to go support Pastor
[1:40:19.080 --> 1:40:23.320]  Manning and his important work, or just spread his videos out as well, because this is what
[1:40:23.320 --> 1:40:24.320]  it's all about.
[1:40:24.320 --> 1:40:28.920]  I'm not in competition with Pastor Manning, with James David Manning, or World Net Daily,
[1:40:28.920 --> 1:40:34.040]  or Daily Caller, or Matt Drudge at DrudgeReport.com, or anybody else for that matter.
[1:40:34.040 --> 1:40:37.960]  I don't want to be in competition with Glenn Beck, who's constantly trying to sabotage
[1:40:37.960 --> 1:40:39.880]  this dirty trick.
[1:40:39.880 --> 1:40:44.800]  I want more of us out there to fight together to restore the Republic, and to restore religious
[1:40:44.800 --> 1:40:45.800]  freedom in the First Amendment.
[1:40:45.800 --> 1:40:49.680]  Now, I got him on, so I might as well go to him, but I'm just really upset today, as people
[1:40:49.680 --> 1:40:50.680]  can tell.
[1:40:50.680 --> 1:40:53.600]  Pastor Manning, I want to go to calls in about six, seven minutes, I want to play some clips
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:40:58.080]  as well, but perhaps you can, I know you have your own show coming up, but perhaps you
[1:40:58.080 --> 1:41:01.920]  can stay a little bit, maybe five minutes into the next hour, so we can finish up with
[1:41:01.920 --> 1:41:04.240]  more of the callers that are here holding.
[1:41:04.240 --> 1:41:09.440]  But I just feel such an earnestness, and it seems like the enemy is moving on all fronts.
[1:41:09.440 --> 1:41:14.320]  Is the enemy moving on all fronts because they're in trouble, or because they're emboldened?
[1:41:14.320 --> 1:41:16.760]  And what do you think about Trump, other big issues?
[1:41:16.760 --> 1:41:19.240]  What's front and center for you right now?
[1:41:19.240 --> 1:41:23.840]  I'll get to Trump in just a moment, but let me say this, we are, I'm getting ready to
[1:41:23.840 --> 1:41:30.640]  have a staff meeting with our programming department and our ministry, we would broadcast,
[1:41:30.640 --> 1:41:34.400]  we could prepare ourselves for the collapse of the dung head media, one of the things
[1:41:34.400 --> 1:41:38.880]  that, and to speak about Trump, one of the things that Trump has been able to do profoundly
[1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:44.760]  is to demonstrate that all media, that they are phonies, they're liars, they're inconsistent,
[1:41:44.760 --> 1:41:48.360]  they're not for the American people, they're bought and paid for.
[1:41:48.360 --> 1:41:53.360]  It doesn't matter whether it's Fox or whether it's MSNBC, he doesn't make a distinction,
[1:41:53.360 --> 1:41:57.920]  they're all in it, if you will, in a way that doesn't produce, that doesn't benefit the
[1:41:57.920 --> 1:41:58.920]  American people.
[1:41:58.920 --> 1:42:03.800]  You made that clear, what I want to say about the Manning report and things we do here,
[1:42:03.800 --> 1:42:07.840]  and certainly you might want to think about it as well, and get your supporters to think
[1:42:07.840 --> 1:42:15.360]  about how we need to start having investment procedures so that we can protect ourselves
[1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:21.880]  at the collapse of the media that are going to collapse as a result of what Trump is
[1:42:21.880 --> 1:42:26.640]  doing, because a number of institutions that are presently standing are not going to stand
[1:42:26.640 --> 1:42:28.560]  on the Trump presidency.
[1:42:28.560 --> 1:42:33.600]  I've said so and everybody listening to me on our broadcast know, I've said that your
[1:42:33.600 --> 1:42:41.240]  ministry, Alex Jones, and Four Wars will be number one when ABC and others go out of business.
[1:42:41.240 --> 1:42:47.120]  You have been bringing the truth, the news to people without being paid for by the advertisers
[1:42:47.120 --> 1:42:51.320]  or the lobbyists or politicians that will not come on your broadcast unless you give
[1:42:51.320 --> 1:42:54.320]  a particular point of view of support for them.
[1:42:54.320 --> 1:42:59.120]  So I think what I'd like to say to our audience is this, is that we need to get prepared to
[1:42:59.120 --> 1:43:05.640]  be better, to be stronger financially, to be able to pick up the mantle as I think the
[1:43:05.640 --> 1:43:11.320]  mantle will fall into our laps in not too many days with what Trump is doing to every
[1:43:11.320 --> 1:43:13.480]  aspect of the established order.
[1:43:13.480 --> 1:43:16.480]  So astute, I've got to have you one more because you're so on target.
[1:43:16.480 --> 1:43:20.320]  The whole facade has already collapsed, they just don't know it yet, and they're only
[1:43:20.320 --> 1:43:22.000]  digging their grave faster.
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:25.080]  Yes, absolutely, absolutely.
[1:43:25.080 --> 1:43:30.160]  And Trump has no power of giving them the shovel and the place to throw the dirt.
[1:43:30.160 --> 1:43:33.640]  So what do you think Trump's place is already in history?
[1:43:33.640 --> 1:43:38.520]  I mean, for whatever reason, he is just devastating them on every front.
[1:43:38.520 --> 1:43:42.040]  What is your view overall of how Trump's doing and where this is going because I'm really
[1:43:42.040 --> 1:43:43.680]  concerned for his safety.
[1:43:43.680 --> 1:43:45.000]  I am too.
[1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:48.880]  And I don't like to talk a lot about it because I don't want to give people ideas, but I am
[1:43:48.880 --> 1:43:52.840]  prayerful there for a prayerful answer, but I would ask everybody else to be concerned.
[1:43:52.840 --> 1:44:02.080]  But Trump is a revolutionary that has you when I look at Trump and I look at George Washington
[1:44:02.080 --> 1:44:03.960]  and everybody please listen to me very carefully.
[1:44:03.960 --> 1:44:07.120]  I'm not trying to raise a man above his statue.
[1:44:07.120 --> 1:44:08.120]  It doesn't profit me.
[1:44:08.120 --> 1:44:13.560]  I've been living too long to do such when I look at how George Washington handled the
[1:44:13.560 --> 1:44:19.560]  establishment of King George and when the revolution was called that we needed to be
[1:44:19.560 --> 1:44:28.440]  set free from England and its tyranny over us as a free and independent people and Washington
[1:44:28.440 --> 1:44:33.480]  was able to lead a fierce battle to have that happen in the Revolutionary War and then become
[1:44:33.480 --> 1:44:34.480]  the president.
[1:44:34.480 --> 1:44:41.960]  You know, when I look at Donald Trump, taking back 200 years back to the 17th to 1800s and
[1:44:41.960 --> 1:44:47.720]  put on him a military suit like George Washington, I think we're cooking with the same gas, if
[1:44:47.720 --> 1:44:52.960]  you will, that and Trump is staring up the hearts of the revolution of Americans.
[1:44:52.960 --> 1:44:55.240]  Well, we will listen to Alex.
[1:44:55.240 --> 1:44:58.180]  We want to take our nation back from the globalist.
[1:44:58.180 --> 1:45:02.280]  We want to take our nation back and Trump is our leader right now.
[1:45:02.280 --> 1:45:04.680]  And he's saying it and he knows it and inside baseball.
[1:45:04.680 --> 1:45:05.680]  He knows even more.
[1:45:05.680 --> 1:45:07.520]  He is on the same page as us.
[1:45:07.520 --> 1:45:09.840]  And that's why the enemy is so scared to death of him.
[1:45:09.840 --> 1:45:12.160]  They know he's not just acting like a populist.
[1:45:12.160 --> 1:45:15.880]  They know from the dossiers on him and the rest of it that he's been aware of this.
[1:45:15.880 --> 1:45:18.800]  He gave money against NAFTA and get 25 years ago.
[1:45:18.800 --> 1:45:20.080]  He hates it all.
[1:45:20.080 --> 1:45:22.440]  He has been basically under the radar.
[1:45:22.440 --> 1:45:24.400]  And so they know and they're scared.
[1:45:24.400 --> 1:45:25.400]  Yeah.
[1:45:25.400 --> 1:45:34.120]  And I think the American people have been have we've not seen such an incitement in the American
[1:45:34.120 --> 1:45:39.000]  people in a very, very long time in this nation.
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  We've spent a very long time.
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:42.840]  Reagan did not bring this kind of excitement.
[1:45:42.840 --> 1:45:51.160]  I know people gradually kind of gravitated to Reagan, but he wasn't a firebrand starting
[1:45:51.160 --> 1:45:57.000]  out the way and he just simply became powerful as time went on.
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:46:02.600]  But Trump has started out a firebrand and the people of America are excited again.
[1:46:02.600 --> 1:46:04.200]  We have to listen to Alex.
[1:46:04.200 --> 1:46:06.120]  We are Americans again.
[1:46:06.120 --> 1:46:13.240]  I mean, we are Americans demanding our constitutional rights, demanding the freedom of excessive
[1:46:13.240 --> 1:46:14.440]  taxation.
[1:46:14.440 --> 1:46:20.120]  We are Americans again, demanding that the government works for us rather than tyranny
[1:46:20.120 --> 1:46:21.680]  towards us.
[1:46:21.680 --> 1:46:25.680]  This is exciting what Trump is doing.
[1:46:25.680 --> 1:46:30.760]  Speaking of that, let's play a clip from the view today where they and the full videos
[1:46:30.760 --> 1:46:31.760]  on info wars.com.
[1:46:31.760 --> 1:46:35.720]  It's about eight minutes long, but here's just a snippet of them talking about Trump
[1:46:35.720 --> 1:46:38.440]  being right about Brussels, Belgium, here it is.
[1:46:38.440 --> 1:46:40.560]  And let me also say this about Donald Trump.
[1:46:40.560 --> 1:46:43.000]  We trash him often here.
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:48.560]  Bottom line is in January, and you've been saying that, Raven, in January of this year,
[1:46:48.560 --> 1:46:55.160]  he said Brussels was a hellhole and this is an interview with Maria Baratiromo, I believe
[1:46:55.160 --> 1:46:56.160]  CNBC.
[1:46:56.160 --> 1:46:57.520]  I could be wrong about that.
[1:46:57.520 --> 1:47:01.880]  He said there is something going on, Maria, and it is not good talking about Belgium, where
[1:47:01.880 --> 1:47:04.440]  they want Sharia law, where they want this, where they want that.
[1:47:04.440 --> 1:47:06.040]  You know, there has to be some assimilation.
[1:47:06.040 --> 1:47:07.040]  There is no assimilation.
[1:47:07.040 --> 1:47:08.040]  You go to Brussels.
[1:47:08.040 --> 1:47:09.960]  I was in Brussels a long time ago, 20 years ago.
[1:47:09.960 --> 1:47:10.960]  So beautiful.
[1:47:10.960 --> 1:47:11.960]  Everything was beautiful.
[1:47:11.960 --> 1:47:12.960]  Now it's living.
[1:47:12.960 --> 1:47:13.960]  It's like living in a hellhole.
[1:47:13.960 --> 1:47:14.960]  Okay.
[1:47:14.960 --> 1:47:15.960]  He said that in January.
[1:47:15.960 --> 1:47:16.960]  Okay.
[1:47:16.960 --> 1:47:19.760]  And he also was right about the fact that we went into Iraq, which was a huge mistake
[1:47:19.760 --> 1:47:20.760]  and part of the problem.
[1:47:20.760 --> 1:47:21.760]  He was right.
[1:47:21.760 --> 1:47:22.760]  So he's right on a couple of things.
[1:47:22.760 --> 1:47:25.080]  So his foreign policy isn't so outrageous.
[1:47:25.080 --> 1:47:27.200]  You know, we were talking about this in the makeup room.
[1:47:27.200 --> 1:47:29.960]  Did we ever think that Donald Trump would be the voice of reason?
[1:47:29.960 --> 1:47:34.880]  And I think his reputation and the fear that so many people have of him is that he's got
[1:47:34.880 --> 1:47:35.880]  the nuclear code.
[1:47:35.880 --> 1:47:36.880]  He's got his finger on the body.
[1:47:36.880 --> 1:47:37.880]  She throws that back in.
[1:47:37.880 --> 1:47:40.240]  But yesterday he came out with NATO and said, let's not be.
[1:47:40.240 --> 1:47:41.240]  Let's stop another that.
[1:47:41.240 --> 1:47:44.520]  He pointed out NATO has actually been fun and ISIS in Al Qaeda.
[1:47:44.520 --> 1:47:46.160]  He actually knows what he's talking about.
[1:47:46.160 --> 1:47:47.520]  That's why they're so upset with him.
[1:47:47.520 --> 1:47:50.920]  But it's common sense if you're bringing in a bunch of people, they're not even checking
[1:47:50.920 --> 1:47:51.920]  their IDs.
[1:47:51.920 --> 1:47:54.880]  He said, stop it till you check until there's some process.
[1:47:54.880 --> 1:47:56.280]  Well, that's common sense.
[1:47:56.280 --> 1:47:59.240]  That's like, don't drill a hole in the bottom of your boat, so you're sure it's not going
[1:47:59.240 --> 1:48:00.240]  to sink.
[1:48:00.240 --> 1:48:05.640]  I mean, the hulks of trying to act like he was bad to say these common sense things,
[1:48:05.640 --> 1:48:06.640]  Pastor Manning.
[1:48:06.640 --> 1:48:07.640]  I see it beginning.
[1:48:07.640 --> 1:48:08.640]  No, he was.
[1:48:08.640 --> 1:48:09.640]  It was absolutely right.
[1:48:09.640 --> 1:48:10.640]  He was absolutely right.
[1:48:10.640 --> 1:48:11.640]  I knew it.
[1:48:11.640 --> 1:48:17.240]  There was not a scintilla daylight between me and my agreement with Trump when he said
[1:48:17.240 --> 1:48:20.320]  what we should do with Muslims in terms of them coming into this nation.
[1:48:20.320 --> 1:48:21.720]  He was absolutely right.
[1:48:21.720 --> 1:48:28.640]  And any reasonable thinking person who loves this nation or even who loves Islam would
[1:48:28.640 --> 1:48:33.520]  say, yes, we ought to make sure we clear, we sort out what the problems are, learn how
[1:48:33.520 --> 1:48:40.320]  to deal with this issue before we continue to allow the floodgates to be open, not knowing
[1:48:40.320 --> 1:48:41.320]  what we're getting.
[1:48:41.320 --> 1:48:42.320]  He's right.
[1:48:42.320 --> 1:48:48.160]  It was those liberals, if you will, bleeding hearts that rose up against Trump.
[1:48:48.160 --> 1:48:53.320]  But even now, people like these older liberals on the view are beginning to say, hey, he's
[1:48:53.320 --> 1:48:54.320]  right.
[1:48:54.320 --> 1:49:01.960]  If we see you, if we have an event of terrorism in America on the order, on the American scale
[1:49:01.960 --> 1:49:06.200]  order is that they're having an either in Paris or in Brussels, you're going to see
[1:49:06.200 --> 1:49:07.840]  many other people.
[1:49:07.840 --> 1:49:12.400]  So what is Obama and the Democratic Party and others thinking when they bring in hundreds
[1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:15.880]  of thousands of these people knowing it's only a matter of time until somebody attacks,
[1:49:15.880 --> 1:49:17.800]  we already saw San Bernardino.
[1:49:17.800 --> 1:49:19.320]  What's the calculus there?
[1:49:19.320 --> 1:49:22.920]  Well, I had a person on our broadcast.
[1:49:22.920 --> 1:49:28.480]  I'm so embarrassed, I can't think of his name right now, he's a very good friend of mine
[1:49:28.480 --> 1:49:35.920]  who is Israeli and he has been watching the Islamic progression now for several years.
[1:49:35.920 --> 1:49:40.960]  And he has told me that the chatter that he's picked up over the years is that Obama wishes
[1:49:40.960 --> 1:49:49.400]  to flood America with thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of Muslims, displace our culture,
[1:49:49.400 --> 1:49:55.720]  give them a new place to set up mosque and to practice their religion and push Christianity
[1:49:55.720 --> 1:49:59.720]  and be if you will, middle Americans to the curb.
[1:49:59.720 --> 1:50:00.960]  And that's Obama's plan.
[1:50:00.960 --> 1:50:01.960]  That's it.
[1:50:01.960 --> 1:50:02.960]  I mean, the West is weak.
[1:50:02.960 --> 1:50:03.960]  We don't have a culture now.
[1:50:03.960 --> 1:50:08.120]  We've given up on God, taken Christ out, and now we're going to bring the Wahhabist religion
[1:50:08.120 --> 1:50:10.040]  of enslavement of women in.
[1:50:10.040 --> 1:50:11.040]  Right.
[1:50:11.040 --> 1:50:12.040]  That's what he said.
[1:50:12.040 --> 1:50:15.440]  And he's been saying that and he will not back down and left this women at universities
[1:50:15.440 --> 1:50:21.480]  almost to a woman line up and Gloria Steinem wouldn't even criticize even radical Islam
[1:50:21.480 --> 1:50:23.440]  when she was on the bill, Mark.
[1:50:23.440 --> 1:50:26.480]  Well, we see where that's going to take us.
[1:50:26.480 --> 1:50:28.920]  And we see exactly how this happening.
[1:50:28.920 --> 1:50:34.960]  But Donald Trump, perhaps maybe our only way in which the recourse is, I would like to
[1:50:34.960 --> 1:50:43.240]  know more about Obama's plan towards either getting the GOP to stop Donald Trump, because
[1:50:43.240 --> 1:50:45.920]  otherwise Donald Trump stops his plans completely.
[1:50:45.920 --> 1:50:51.480]  He does not plan to allow a big old crowbar right in the mix of their machine.
[1:50:51.480 --> 1:50:53.480]  We're going to come back with calls with Pastor Manning.
[1:50:53.480 --> 1:50:54.480]  I'm a significant state.
[1:50:54.480 --> 1:50:55.480]  Maybe 15 minutes to the next hour.
[1:50:55.480 --> 1:50:56.480]  He may have to go.
[1:50:56.480 --> 1:51:00.160]  Regardless of one of your calls next segment, stay with us.
[1:51:00.160 --> 1:51:04.040]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[1:51:04.040 --> 1:51:08.280]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks and
[1:51:08.280 --> 1:51:10.280]  head to head fitness tests.
[1:51:10.280 --> 1:51:12.160]  How is this even possible?
[1:51:12.160 --> 1:51:16.600]  Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated
[1:51:16.600 --> 1:51:19.800]  fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[1:51:19.800 --> 1:51:23.200]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's
[1:51:23.200 --> 1:51:27.560]  made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[1:51:27.560 --> 1:51:31.960]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[1:51:31.960 --> 1:51:36.360]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number
[1:51:36.360 --> 1:51:40.720]  of free sample packs specifically for our conservative friends.
[1:51:40.720 --> 1:51:42.240]  But you must act fast.
[1:51:42.240 --> 1:51:46.200]  Due to the high demand from members of the Coast Guard, our supply is extremely limited
[1:51:46.200 --> 1:51:47.200]  right now.
[1:51:47.200 --> 1:51:53.120]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to greens75.com.

[1:51:59.320 --> 1:52:03.560]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[1:52:03.560 --> 1:52:04.560]  It's true.
[1:52:04.560 --> 1:52:08.320]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[1:52:08.320 --> 1:52:10.840]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[1:52:10.840 --> 1:52:15.520]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[1:52:15.520 --> 1:52:22.400]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals,
[1:52:22.400 --> 1:52:28.400]  BPA, pesticides, bacteria, and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.

[1:52:37.720 --> 1:52:39.200]  cents per gallon.

[1:54:14.160 --> 1:54:25.120]  Every day I see articles that show the discrimination against conservatives, Christians, libertarians,
[1:54:25.120 --> 1:54:26.120]  anti-Satans, basically.
[1:54:26.120 --> 1:54:29.160]  Pepsi, Visa, and Chevron are exempt from Health and Human Services mandate, which is huge
[1:54:29.160 --> 1:54:31.280]  tax, basically.
[1:54:31.280 --> 1:54:36.160]  But little sisters of the poor are not, see, any real charity, any Christian group.
[1:54:36.160 --> 1:54:43.680]  In the last five years, Obama's issued one Christian charity, 501c3, that was conservative,
[1:54:43.680 --> 1:54:45.720]  and tens of thousands of quote liberals.
[1:54:45.720 --> 1:54:48.120]  See how this works?
[1:54:48.120 --> 1:54:50.400]  This is total takeover.
[1:54:50.400 --> 1:54:54.200]  That story is from Life News, it's up on drugreport.com and infowars.com.
[1:54:54.200 --> 1:55:00.240]  But it just shows, now, oh, thousands of big companies are exempt from Obamacare, but your
[1:55:00.240 --> 1:55:03.800]  company isn't, meaning that it makes it where you can't compete.
[1:55:03.800 --> 1:55:09.280]  A mom-and-pop hamburger place isn't exempt, but McDonald's is.
[1:55:09.280 --> 1:55:13.640]  But we're all busy thinking about skin color as discriminatory, that's why they try to
[1:55:13.640 --> 1:55:17.920]  drive it in our heads all day, because that goes on, but nothing like the New World Order
[1:55:17.920 --> 1:55:20.000]  that's exempt from taxes and above the law.
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:27.160]  I want to go to David, Kyle, Steven, Mike, Robert, Mr. Manning, Pastor James David Manning
[1:55:27.160 --> 1:55:30.480]  will be with us 15 minutes in, or 20 minutes into the next hour.
[1:55:30.480 --> 1:55:31.480]  We appreciate that.
[1:55:31.480 --> 1:55:35.880]  Then I've got so much other news coming up as well, and a bunch of special reports I haven't
[1:55:35.880 --> 1:55:36.880]  hit yet.
[1:55:36.880 --> 1:55:42.240]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[1:55:42.240 --> 1:55:46.240]  Let's go ahead and talk to some folks in Washington.
[1:55:46.240 --> 1:55:50.000]  Kyle, he wants to talk about Obama and his Islamic ring.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:51.720]  Yeah, the media says that's debunked.
[1:55:51.720 --> 1:55:54.600]  No, he wears an Arabic-Islamic ring.
[1:55:54.600 --> 1:55:55.920]  He speaks perfect Arabic.
[1:55:55.920 --> 1:56:02.000]  His first speech was in Cairo, a bunch of his family are Muslims, and he badmouts Christianity
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:03.000]  every Easter.
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  So, let's get your question on that, Kyle.
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  Go ahead.
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:11.440]  Oh, yeah, I find it very interesting, I mean, he's worn this ring even before he got married
[1:56:11.440 --> 1:56:18.200]  and his colleagues found it odd, and the ring actually says there is no God except Allah.
[1:56:18.200 --> 1:56:22.400]  So when we were just saying, you know, he can't even be seen next to a cross, I mean,
[1:56:22.400 --> 1:56:27.680]  this guy clearly has all the ties to Islamic beliefs, Islamic religion, and still won't
[1:56:27.680 --> 1:56:31.160]  even call it radicalized Islam, and it's just ridiculous.
[1:56:31.160 --> 1:56:35.200]  Sure, well, they say Napoleon converted near the end, but then got beat for an alliance
[1:56:35.200 --> 1:56:36.200]  to Islam.
[1:56:36.200 --> 1:56:41.400]  But I wonder if this is another bait to switch the credit class of civilizations, or is Obama
[1:56:41.400 --> 1:56:48.280]  with a shadowy CIA history, and his mom and his tranny, a nanny, and then in Arabic schools,
[1:56:48.280 --> 1:56:51.840]  I mean, in any Muslim school, they kill a tranny.
[1:56:51.840 --> 1:56:56.640]  What do you think is going on here, a pastor manning, is he really a Muslim, or is he just
[1:56:56.640 --> 1:56:57.640]  something else?
[1:56:57.640 --> 1:56:59.640]  Well, I can tell you this, what's his name?
[1:56:59.640 --> 1:57:00.640]  What's his name?
[1:57:00.640 --> 1:57:02.160]  Barack Hussein Obama.
[1:57:02.160 --> 1:57:04.280]  Well, how Muslim is that?
[1:57:04.280 --> 1:57:10.880]  I mean, that you don't get any more Muslim than that, and his ring is simply an insignia
[1:57:10.880 --> 1:57:14.400]  of what he, what, who he is.
[1:57:14.400 --> 1:57:16.360]  And you know, our names are very important, Alex.
[1:57:16.360 --> 1:57:18.320]  They say a lot about us.
[1:57:18.320 --> 1:57:19.560]  They are very powerful.
[1:57:19.560 --> 1:57:21.240]  I can tell you probably came from questions.
[1:57:21.240 --> 1:57:22.240]  Your name's David.
[1:57:22.240 --> 1:57:23.240]  My dad's name's David.
[1:57:23.240 --> 1:57:24.240]  Right.
[1:57:24.240 --> 1:57:26.440]  So there you have it.
[1:57:26.440 --> 1:57:33.120]  So his ring is simply a, if you will, his name rather demonstrates that he will wear,
[1:57:33.120 --> 1:57:36.720]  that's why he's wearing that ring, that there is no other God than Allah.
[1:57:36.720 --> 1:57:39.320]  And he has this very profound Islamic name.
[1:57:39.320 --> 1:57:41.680]  I've never heard, I've never heard you put it so good.
[1:57:41.680 --> 1:57:42.680]  Nobody ever made that point.
[1:57:42.680 --> 1:57:45.920]  His name, his name is bigger than the ring.
[1:57:45.920 --> 1:57:47.720]  It's Barack Hussein Obama.
[1:57:47.720 --> 1:57:49.200]  There you have it.
[1:57:49.200 --> 1:57:51.000]  What am I going to say next?
[1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:53.520]  I mean, there you have it.
[1:57:53.520 --> 1:57:54.520]  It's incredible.
[1:57:54.520 --> 1:57:56.960]  So he, so it's not just a CIA cover.
[1:57:56.960 --> 1:58:00.400]  You think he, well, a lot of insiders believe, I mean, I'm talking how the Pentagon, they
[1:58:00.400 --> 1:58:02.480]  say no, Secret Service, you name it.
[1:58:02.480 --> 1:58:05.200]  The word is he actually gets down before Mecca every day.
[1:58:05.200 --> 1:58:10.360]  Well, I think that we need to understand that the CIA is not necessarily a patriot organization
[1:58:10.360 --> 1:58:12.240]  nor a Christian organization.
[1:58:12.240 --> 1:58:17.560]  I think they're a globalist inspired organization and their allegiance would be to Islam as
[1:58:17.560 --> 1:58:18.560]  well as anybody else.
[1:58:18.560 --> 1:58:22.720]  I mean, though they are financed by American tax dollars, we need to be clear about that.
[1:58:22.720 --> 1:58:26.280]  Well, Brandon reported, he's lived in Saudi Arabia 20 years and converted to a hobbyism.
[1:58:26.280 --> 1:58:29.000]  I see, you know, the head of the CIA.
[1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  Wow.
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:31.000]  I tell you, I know this.
[1:58:31.000 --> 1:58:32.000]  They hate Christians and gun owners.
[1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  They hate prosperity.
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:36.520]  They hate our coal plants, doubling our prices, they're doing everything they can to shut
[1:58:36.520 --> 1:58:37.520]  this country down.
[1:58:37.520 --> 1:58:38.680]  They're not making stupid deals.
[1:58:38.680 --> 1:58:39.680]  They hate this country.
[1:58:39.680 --> 1:58:40.680]  Trump's wrong.
[1:58:40.680 --> 1:58:41.680]  Thank you for listening.
[1:58:41.680 --> 1:58:42.680]  They're not making dumb deals.
[1:58:42.680 --> 1:58:43.800]  They're making deals to shut us down.

[1:59:51.480 --> 1:59:58.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:58.480 --> 2:00:15.480]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:15.480 --> 2:00:22.280]  Alright, Pastor Manning's with us to the end of the next segment.
[2:00:22.280 --> 2:00:26.280]  This is a short segment and a 12-minute segment coming up.
[2:00:26.280 --> 2:00:30.880]  I'm not apologizing for the fact some days I get really excited, but I'm like somebody
[2:00:30.880 --> 2:00:34.480]  running around trying to warn my neighbors their house is on fire, and they're not listening
[2:00:34.480 --> 2:00:36.600]  to me, and now they're on fire.
[2:00:36.600 --> 2:00:39.560]  And then next, my house is going to be on fire.
[2:00:39.560 --> 2:00:41.400]  So it's not even I'm a goody two-shoes empathy.
[2:00:41.400 --> 2:00:47.000]  I do have empathy, but seeing people get screwed over, you know, seeing somebody get run over,
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:50.120]  I've seen somebody hit by a car before, and they have empathy for them.
[2:00:50.120 --> 2:00:52.040]  It feels horrible.
[2:00:52.040 --> 2:00:53.720]  And I just don't get where the empathy is.
[2:00:53.720 --> 2:00:58.400]  And I think so much of what's happening in our civilization is that we're losing empathy,
[2:00:58.400 --> 2:01:03.360]  and that's being done by the system so that we don't want to do unto others as we would
[2:01:03.360 --> 2:01:04.520]  have them do unto us.
[2:01:04.520 --> 2:01:08.080]  I mean, the golden rule makes a lot of sense, doesn't it, Pastor Manning?
[2:01:08.080 --> 2:01:13.360]  Absolutely, but one of the reasons for that, Al, it's not the ultimate reason and the only
[2:01:13.360 --> 2:01:19.720]  reason, but there's a biblical phrase about people becoming at ease and xime.
[2:01:19.720 --> 2:01:23.880]  America has become or had become so prosperous and so powerful.
[2:01:23.880 --> 2:01:29.080]  I mean, it was like an overdrive and everybody who simply put their heart to the American
[2:01:29.080 --> 2:01:31.880]  dream prospered.
[2:01:31.880 --> 2:01:35.480]  And so at that point, we stopped defending our borders.
[2:01:35.480 --> 2:01:40.800]  We stopped thinking about how precious our Constitution is, our better rights.
[2:01:40.800 --> 2:01:45.600]  The thing that brought us to that point of great prosperity, great wealth, Harold is
[2:01:45.600 --> 2:01:48.600]  the greatest nation in civilization ever.
[2:01:48.600 --> 2:01:50.520]  We just became very much at ease.
[2:01:50.520 --> 2:01:53.800]  It's like having a super gorgeous, nice girlfriend for four or five years.
[2:01:53.800 --> 2:01:56.400]  You start taking her for granted pretty soon she's gone.
[2:01:56.400 --> 2:01:57.400]  Right.
[2:01:57.400 --> 2:02:01.520]  And that's exactly what happened to us.
[2:02:01.520 --> 2:02:02.760]  And so we need to reclaim that.
[2:02:02.760 --> 2:02:07.680]  We need to look at how that has taken place and try to come back to trying to get that
[2:02:07.680 --> 2:02:12.800]  girlfriend back and learn how to treat her once the right way, treat her like a lady
[2:02:12.800 --> 2:02:14.160]  when we do get her back.
[2:02:14.160 --> 2:02:15.160]  Wow.
[2:02:15.160 --> 2:02:16.160]  I want to go to breaks.
[2:02:16.160 --> 2:02:18.280]  We have plenty of time to take these calls and not interrupt you, but the three minutes
[2:02:18.280 --> 2:02:22.000]  we've got left before we go to break, you use so many amazing points.
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:25.720]  What else is on your radar that you haven't imparted to folks, Pastor Manning?
[2:02:25.720 --> 2:02:32.960]  I mean, again, our prayers are for Donald Trump, we have a Harlem for Trump campaign here,
[2:02:32.960 --> 2:02:39.000]  Alex, right here in Harlem, where we're actively campaigning to get people to vote for Trump
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:41.960]  in the primary and also in the general.
[2:02:41.960 --> 2:02:47.000]  We have, we're telling people in this community where you've got 53% unemployment in this
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:50.840]  community that Trump can put you back to work again.
[2:02:50.840 --> 2:02:55.920]  We're getting people ready to be trained as air conditioner repair people, refrigeration,
[2:02:55.920 --> 2:03:03.480]  plumbers, electricians, landscape architect people under the Trump campaign and Trump
[2:03:03.480 --> 2:03:08.040]  bringing jobs back from India and China is going to put America back and put Harlem back
[2:03:08.040 --> 2:03:09.040]  to work again.
[2:03:09.040 --> 2:03:11.040]  I want to talk about that.
[2:03:11.040 --> 2:03:12.040]  Well, that's exciting.
[2:03:12.040 --> 2:03:13.280]  And I don't want to get off in this diversion.
[2:03:13.280 --> 2:03:16.960]  They still asking why won't disavow in the Klan after he's done over a hundred times.
[2:03:16.960 --> 2:03:22.080]  He always had, they just lied and said he hadn't and you know, there he was having great
[2:03:22.080 --> 2:03:24.040]  history working with everybody.
[2:03:24.040 --> 2:03:29.200]  It just shows how what liars they are that they keep just injecting race this race that
[2:03:29.200 --> 2:03:33.640]  but I've seen in polls, he gets double the black vote of what Mitt Romney did in national
[2:03:33.640 --> 2:03:34.640]  polls.
[2:03:34.640 --> 2:03:39.760]  So at least some black people out there are figuring this out on a date that he was he
[2:03:39.760 --> 2:03:42.400]  was pummeled on this issue of the Klan.
[2:03:42.400 --> 2:03:46.480]  I talked with Michael Cohen, who is Trump's very special assistant.
[2:03:46.480 --> 2:03:49.760]  We have been going back and forth for the last couple of weeks talking personally over
[2:03:49.760 --> 2:03:55.040]  several items going on here in New York City and Michael and I both agree.
[2:03:55.040 --> 2:03:56.800]  Trump handled the question.
[2:03:56.800 --> 2:04:06.040]  He indicated that he denied the white supremacy idea and the Klan and David Duke in a manner
[2:04:06.040 --> 2:04:10.400]  that was respectful if there was a respectful reporter to report it.
[2:04:10.400 --> 2:04:16.240]  The problem is however I pointed out to Michael Cohen is that David Duke has a right to vote
[2:04:16.240 --> 2:04:19.760]  for what he's still a citizen, whether you like his policies or not, whether you like
[2:04:19.760 --> 2:04:20.760]  his politics.
[2:04:20.760 --> 2:04:23.600]  And I don't agree with David Duke, but he's still a citizen.
[2:04:23.600 --> 2:04:27.280]  And if he wants to vote for Donald Trump and wants to make it a public statement that wants
[2:04:27.280 --> 2:04:29.600]  for Donald Trump, what the hell is Donald Trump supposed to do?
[2:04:29.600 --> 2:04:32.320]  Don't vote for me because I don't like your policies.
[2:04:32.320 --> 2:04:36.520]  Then there'd be a whole lot of people that would be exercised from the voting system.
[2:04:36.520 --> 2:04:37.760]  Disappear dirty stunt.
[2:04:37.760 --> 2:04:41.560]  But then even after he kept disavowing, they kept saying, why won't you disavow one time
[2:04:41.560 --> 2:04:43.560]  at the same press conference?
[2:04:43.560 --> 2:04:45.440]  Three reporters almost in a row.
[2:04:45.440 --> 2:04:47.440]  By the third one, he went, I just did it.
[2:04:47.440 --> 2:04:48.920]  Oh, you're going to edit this.
[2:04:48.920 --> 2:04:49.920]  Yes, I disavowed in.
[2:04:49.920 --> 2:04:53.080]  Playing this game, hoping he would say I just disavowed it.
[2:04:53.080 --> 2:04:56.400]  I tell you, they are so dirty and the American people are seeing through it.
[2:04:56.400 --> 2:04:57.840]  Your calls are three minutes away.
[2:04:57.840 --> 2:04:59.280]  Stay with us, Mike, David and others.
[2:04:59.280 --> 2:05:05.320]  The left-leaning women from the popular daytime TV show, The View, are finally starting to
[2:05:05.320 --> 2:05:12.520]  admit that they agree with Donald Trump on his foreign policy and views on ISIS.
[2:05:12.520 --> 2:05:14.960]  I thought Donald Trump sounded really reasonable today.
[2:05:14.960 --> 2:05:20.720]  My law enforcement background kicked in because we need to be forceful.
[2:05:20.720 --> 2:05:24.240]  We can't have these muted responses to terror.
[2:05:24.240 --> 2:05:26.320]  Let me also say this about Donald Trump.
[2:05:26.320 --> 2:05:28.840]  We trash him often here.
[2:05:28.840 --> 2:05:34.560]  Bottom line is, in January, and you've been saying that, Raven, in January of this year,
[2:05:34.560 --> 2:05:36.760]  he said Brussels was a hellhole.
[2:05:36.760 --> 2:05:40.880]  He said there is something going on, Maria, and it is not good talking about Belgium.
[2:05:40.880 --> 2:05:41.880]  He was right.
[2:05:41.880 --> 2:05:42.880]  So he's right on a couple of things.
[2:05:42.880 --> 2:05:45.360]  Your policy isn't so outrageous.
[2:05:45.360 --> 2:05:48.080]  So is Donald Trump really the voice of reason?
[2:05:48.080 --> 2:05:53.200]  And which candidate makes you feel safer, Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton?
[2:05:53.200 --> 2:05:57.840]  Let us know what you think in the comment section right now at infowars.com.
[2:05:57.840 --> 2:05:59.840]  Hey, how are you doing?
[2:05:59.840 --> 2:06:00.840]  Good, brother.
[2:06:00.840 --> 2:06:01.840]  Just recently started using your products.
[2:06:01.840 --> 2:06:03.840]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[2:06:03.840 --> 2:06:08.240]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[2:06:08.240 --> 2:06:11.680]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation, but doing that I know
[2:06:11.680 --> 2:06:13.800]  I've got to have the highest quality.
[2:06:13.800 --> 2:06:19.680]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of
[2:06:19.680 --> 2:06:20.680]  using synthetic chemicals.
[2:06:20.680 --> 2:06:26.320]  We do the super male and the super female vitality, big changes, a lot of energy.
[2:06:26.320 --> 2:06:31.240]  We've gotten off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, a big ton of money there.
[2:06:31.240 --> 2:06:36.960]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated,
[2:06:36.960 --> 2:06:38.480]  or maximum potency.
[2:06:38.480 --> 2:06:42.920]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a
[2:06:42.920 --> 2:06:47.040]  while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally
[2:06:47.040 --> 2:06:49.040]  going goes right to the source.
[2:06:49.040 --> 2:06:50.960]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[2:06:50.960 --> 2:06:56.840]  Visit infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products
[2:06:56.840 --> 2:07:00.280]  from Info Wars Life.
[2:07:00.280 --> 2:07:04.040]  Thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry.
[2:07:04.040 --> 2:07:08.920]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[2:07:08.920 --> 2:07:11.760]  to organize and prepare a defense.
[2:07:11.760 --> 2:07:18.000]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[2:07:18.000 --> 2:07:20.520]  of their own, air raid sirens.
[2:07:20.520 --> 2:07:26.000]  But in the 21st century, there were silent weapons for quiet war, pathogens added to
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones,
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:34.520]  and accelerate our journey towards death.
[2:07:34.520 --> 2:07:38.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:45.960]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation
[2:07:45.960 --> 2:07:49.200]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[2:07:49.200 --> 2:07:52.160]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[2:07:52.160 --> 2:07:57.040]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at infowarslife.com
[2:07:57.040 --> 2:07:58.040]  with Anthroplex.
[2:07:58.040 --> 2:08:24.600]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:08:24.600 --> 2:08:30.120]  Well, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, has come out and said something
[2:08:30.120 --> 2:08:32.760]  that I actually agree with.
[2:08:32.760 --> 2:08:34.720]  This will be a day long remember.
[2:08:34.720 --> 2:08:40.280]  Giuliani, Hillary Clinton, could be considered a founding member of ISIS.
[2:08:40.280 --> 2:08:42.240]  Trump has already begun to talk about this.
[2:08:42.240 --> 2:08:49.120]  It's a fact that she funded Al Qaeda in Syria and in Libya and in Egypt.
[2:08:49.120 --> 2:08:51.160]  I mean, we have her right handed.
[2:08:51.160 --> 2:08:52.240]  That's what Benghazi is.
[2:08:52.240 --> 2:08:55.800]  This is so big, that's from CNN News of all places.
[2:08:55.800 --> 2:08:56.800]  This is massive.
[2:08:56.800 --> 2:09:02.120]  And, of course, we have Donald Trump tweeting out an interview I did with Roger Stone out
[2:09:02.120 --> 2:09:03.120]  on his Twitter.
[2:09:03.120 --> 2:09:05.160]  That makes the media really, really upset.
[2:09:05.160 --> 2:09:08.840]  And if they don't like that, they're not going to like what Roger Stone talks about
[2:09:08.840 --> 2:09:10.840]  on Monday here.
[2:09:10.840 --> 2:09:15.280]  The folks over at the Trump operation with Roger Stone, it's not part of the Trump
[2:09:15.280 --> 2:09:17.280]  operation, wink, wink.
[2:09:17.280 --> 2:09:22.200]  They're going to be breaking some big news here on Monday because they know the media
[2:09:22.200 --> 2:09:27.080]  likes to come attack the info here, as if it's discredited if it's said here, when
[2:09:27.080 --> 2:09:31.200]  actually it only blasted out more if it's said here, which shows the arrogance.
[2:09:31.200 --> 2:09:33.920]  Pastor, I want to go right to these calls, but you're right in the belly of the beast
[2:09:33.920 --> 2:09:34.920]  there in New York City.
[2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:38.360]  You've shown your various stupe with your predictions and the things you say.
[2:09:38.360 --> 2:09:41.120]  I mean, I really am genuinely wanting your opinion.
[2:09:41.120 --> 2:09:44.840]  You talk about the death of the mainstream media is nigh.
[2:09:44.840 --> 2:09:48.840]  I agree, they're already collapsing, but they still are incredibly arrogant.
[2:09:48.840 --> 2:09:53.680]  They still don't seem to know how things work or how hated they are.
[2:09:53.680 --> 2:09:59.360]  I think that's really our biggest leg up is that I don't think they realize yet that
[2:09:59.360 --> 2:10:00.360]  they've already fallen.
[2:10:00.360 --> 2:10:04.200]  I think Humpty Dumpty still thinks he's up on that wall.
[2:10:04.200 --> 2:10:09.520]  What the problem is with them is that they cannot confess, they cannot repent and confess
[2:10:09.520 --> 2:10:13.600]  and come clean because they've committed so many crimes.
[2:10:13.600 --> 2:10:19.040]  They're better off taking their shot with arrogance and trying to maintain the status quo, hoping
[2:10:19.040 --> 2:10:21.040]  their problem will go away.
[2:10:21.040 --> 2:10:24.520]  But they can't just turn around and confess and say, this is what we've done.
[2:10:24.520 --> 2:10:27.240]  This is how we've manipulated the American people.
[2:10:27.240 --> 2:10:30.840]  We've manipulated the news, manipulated politics.
[2:10:30.840 --> 2:10:33.000]  They can't do that, Alex.
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:35.840]  It's just deadly if they did.
[2:10:35.840 --> 2:10:39.880]  So they'd rather take their chance on being arrogant and hoping that they can drain every
[2:10:39.880 --> 2:10:45.440]  ounce of another minute of life and their so-called freedom and prosperity and power
[2:10:45.440 --> 2:10:46.440]  that they can.
[2:10:46.440 --> 2:10:47.440]  They're not going to repent.
[2:10:47.440 --> 2:10:49.320]  They're not going to confess.
[2:10:49.320 --> 2:10:55.120]  Remember Gruber came out in six different clips, or more now, and said, the public are idiots.
[2:10:55.120 --> 2:10:56.120]  Good thing they're dumb.
[2:10:56.120 --> 2:10:57.120]  Good thing they don't pay attention.
[2:10:57.120 --> 2:11:01.080]  I met with Obama on ways to lie and triple prices.
[2:11:01.080 --> 2:11:06.440]  He adopted my plan and all these PhDs are worshiping him because they're learning how
[2:11:06.440 --> 2:11:08.200]  to be liars and get jobs.
[2:11:08.200 --> 2:11:13.040]  You don't learn how to build a better healthcare plan or have better metrics to get a job.
[2:11:13.040 --> 2:11:16.160]  It's now about being the most deceitful devil in the room.
[2:11:16.160 --> 2:11:20.360]  But Gruber didn't get the memo that you're not supposed to go on C-span and brag about
[2:11:20.360 --> 2:11:22.360]  it to everybody.
[2:11:22.360 --> 2:11:23.360]  Yeah.
[2:11:23.360 --> 2:11:24.360]  You're right.
[2:11:24.360 --> 2:11:25.860]  He didn't.
[2:11:25.860 --> 2:11:32.880]  But these things happen, and Alex, at some point in time, you and I and others continue
[2:11:32.880 --> 2:11:33.880]  to do what we're doing.
[2:11:33.880 --> 2:11:39.560]  Somebody's going to have not, would not have gotten the memo about Obama's eligibility,
[2:11:39.560 --> 2:11:42.520]  his shadowy involvement in the CIA.
[2:11:42.520 --> 2:11:45.320]  Somebody's going to come out and speak about that as well.
[2:11:45.320 --> 2:11:50.200]  You can't keep all of that information under lock and key.
[2:11:50.200 --> 2:11:53.840]  At some point, somebody's going to slip, and we're going to hear some things that you've
[2:11:53.840 --> 2:11:55.640]  been talking about for years.
[2:11:55.640 --> 2:11:57.040]  Well, that's right.
[2:11:57.040 --> 2:12:00.280]  They tried to intimidate whistleblowers, but more and more, so many people are speaking
[2:12:00.280 --> 2:12:01.280]  out.
[2:12:01.280 --> 2:12:02.280]  They can't stop everybody.
[2:12:02.280 --> 2:12:05.640]  You've been visited and threatened, you've been visited and threatened by the government.
[2:12:05.640 --> 2:12:09.320]  And you know, I just laugh and say, and usually they're like, we don't like doing this.
[2:12:09.320 --> 2:12:10.320]  We just told to come here.
[2:12:10.320 --> 2:12:11.800]  I'm like, yeah, the country's collapsing.
[2:12:11.800 --> 2:12:13.920]  Why don't you go do something more important?
[2:12:13.920 --> 2:12:17.920]  I know you've had those visits, and it's just crazy.
[2:12:17.920 --> 2:12:22.320]  Were the people that visited you on a power trip, or do they look kind of ashamed of themselves?
[2:12:22.320 --> 2:12:27.720]  You know, when they came, they brought not only the government officials, the CIA group,
[2:12:27.720 --> 2:12:32.600]  but they recruited members of the local police department to come to Flankow Church and to
[2:12:32.600 --> 2:12:34.440]  walk in with them.
[2:12:34.440 --> 2:12:37.200]  And I suppose they thought it was a racial thing.
[2:12:37.200 --> 2:12:44.120]  So they brought several high-ranking African-American black police officers to pave the way.
[2:12:44.120 --> 2:12:48.320]  They didn't come by themselves, but they asked the questions.
[2:12:48.320 --> 2:12:49.320]  You've asked me questions.
[2:12:49.320 --> 2:12:50.320]  Think about that.
[2:12:50.320 --> 2:12:53.760]  The CIA scared to come talk to a well-known, loving black preacher.
[2:12:53.760 --> 2:12:55.920]  I mean, how cowardly is that?
[2:12:55.920 --> 2:12:57.560]  But that's what they did.
[2:12:57.560 --> 2:12:58.560]  They did not come by.
[2:12:58.560 --> 2:13:00.160]  They brought the local police department with them.
[2:13:00.160 --> 2:13:02.440]  I mean, I would be so comfortable walking into a black church.
[2:13:02.440 --> 2:13:03.440]  Been in many of them growing up.
[2:13:03.440 --> 2:13:05.720]  I mean, these people are so disconnected from reality.
[2:13:05.720 --> 2:13:12.800]  Well, I'm going to tell you, but they were kind of like we're just doing our job.
[2:13:12.800 --> 2:13:16.280]  I don't know if we necessarily dislike you or hate you, but we've been told to come
[2:13:16.280 --> 2:13:18.480]  and check you out, and that's what they did.
[2:13:18.480 --> 2:13:20.360]  They weren't arrogant.
[2:13:20.360 --> 2:13:24.480]  They weren't like we were going to arrest you or anything of that nature.
[2:13:24.480 --> 2:13:28.080]  It was just an attempt to intimidate because it was their orders and didn't work too well.
[2:13:28.080 --> 2:13:29.080]  Did it?
[2:13:29.080 --> 2:13:31.680]  I think you've up what you've done probably five times since then.
[2:13:31.680 --> 2:13:32.680]  I've gotten even bolder.
[2:13:32.680 --> 2:13:33.680]  You're right.
[2:13:33.680 --> 2:13:36.960]  I mean, I've gone off the chain since that experience.
[2:13:36.960 --> 2:13:39.040]  So it didn't, it didn't, it didn't help them.
[2:13:39.040 --> 2:13:40.040]  And I don't know what it is.
[2:13:40.040 --> 2:13:41.760]  When I get threatened, it's not even like a one up.
[2:13:41.760 --> 2:13:42.760]  I can't help it.
[2:13:42.760 --> 2:13:43.760]  I get more bold.
[2:13:43.760 --> 2:13:44.760]  I get more energy.
[2:13:44.760 --> 2:13:46.760]  It's crazy.
[2:13:46.760 --> 2:13:50.520]  I don't appreciate being threatened, first of all, by anything or anybody.
[2:13:50.520 --> 2:13:56.440]  I, I just don't like people saying to me that they're going to, they're going to have
[2:13:56.440 --> 2:14:00.640]  a power over me unless I act a particular way.
[2:14:00.640 --> 2:14:03.160]  I don't like that from anybody or anything.
[2:14:03.160 --> 2:14:04.160]  And I never have.
[2:14:04.160 --> 2:14:07.760]  From the time I was a schoolboy, I just don't like that.
[2:14:07.760 --> 2:14:09.160]  But that's what they did.
[2:14:09.160 --> 2:14:14.800]  They thought that by coming that I would tone down what I was saying and I would be looking
[2:14:14.800 --> 2:14:19.960]  at prison bars and a long prison sentence and I would abdicate my own integrity to
[2:14:19.960 --> 2:14:21.440]  avoid prison.
[2:14:21.440 --> 2:14:22.440]  Nothing could have been further from the truth.
[2:14:22.440 --> 2:14:27.880]  We all know a coward does a thousand deaths and Pastor David J. Manning is our guest
[2:14:27.880 --> 2:14:32.640]  or James David Manning, the stuff that America's made of with this audience and our great guest.
[2:14:32.640 --> 2:14:34.560]  Let's go to Mike in Texas.
[2:14:34.560 --> 2:14:37.880]  You're on the year with Pastor James David Manning of otlud.org.
[2:14:37.880 --> 2:14:38.880]  Go ahead.
[2:14:38.880 --> 2:14:39.880]  Thanks for holding.
[2:14:39.880 --> 2:14:40.880]  Yeah.
[2:14:40.880 --> 2:14:41.880]  Good afternoon, Pastor Manning.
[2:14:41.880 --> 2:14:44.000]  What a great, I love to listen to you talk.
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:46.560]  It's what the neighborhoods and neighbors should be sitting down.
[2:14:46.560 --> 2:14:47.960]  There's these types of discussions.
[2:14:47.960 --> 2:14:51.200]  So, thank you for what you do.
[2:14:51.200 --> 2:14:56.840]  The question I had was, why do you think so many Americans and Obama supporters can't
[2:14:56.840 --> 2:15:00.400]  see the hypocrisy in his words and actions?
[2:15:00.400 --> 2:15:06.760]  For example, there's this huge movement to label Mr. Trump as a, as Hitler and a Nazi.
[2:15:06.760 --> 2:15:13.040]  And in his own words during his campaign, he stated in direct relation to terrorism
[2:15:13.040 --> 2:15:16.880]  that we need a civilian force as big and well funded as the military.
[2:15:16.880 --> 2:15:19.120]  I mean, that's hypocrisy right there.
[2:15:19.120 --> 2:15:20.120]  Wouldn't you agree?
[2:15:20.120 --> 2:15:22.120]  I mean, the Brownshirts theology.
[2:15:22.120 --> 2:15:23.120]  Sure.
[2:15:23.120 --> 2:15:28.000]  If you want parallels to Hitler, I mean, isn't Obama a lot more parallels than Trump?
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:29.000]  Absolutely.
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:33.960]  And he did make the Brownshirts statement in the early days of his administration.
[2:15:33.960 --> 2:15:39.400]  But I think Mike, what's happening is that many people that voted for him did so for
[2:15:39.400 --> 2:15:47.120]  a religious purpose, more so than a political one, and they too cannot walk back.
[2:15:47.120 --> 2:15:53.400]  The fact that they entered into a spiritual worship of this man that now they'd have to
[2:15:53.400 --> 2:15:59.160]  completely state was, was a mistake and would make them look like they, they have no ability
[2:15:59.160 --> 2:16:01.000]  to make right decisions.
[2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:07.120]  And so they're holding on to that decision, even though they know it was a wrong decision.
[2:16:07.120 --> 2:16:08.120]  Absolutely.
[2:16:08.120 --> 2:16:10.120]  And now they just can't stop.
[2:16:10.120 --> 2:16:15.480]  They're just keep saying Nazi, Nazi, Nazi, Nazi, racist, racist, racist, as if, as if
[2:16:15.480 --> 2:16:16.480]  that people are going to buy it.
[2:16:16.480 --> 2:16:17.840]  I don't see it working anymore.
[2:16:17.840 --> 2:16:18.840]  Thank you, Mike.
[2:16:18.840 --> 2:16:22.360]  David, New Jersey, a little bit closer to where James David Manning is up in New York.
[2:16:22.360 --> 2:16:23.360]  Go ahead.
[2:16:23.360 --> 2:16:25.360]  Hey, greetings, guys.
[2:16:25.360 --> 2:16:27.360]  I thank God for you both.
[2:16:27.360 --> 2:16:32.200]  Pastor, this is a gospel and a Martin Luther King question, please.
[2:16:32.200 --> 2:16:39.680]  Yeah, I think the optics of hate against to shut down free speech are so incredible that
[2:16:39.680 --> 2:16:48.200]  it's such an opportunity for nonviolence to really respond in streets, on these news programs,
[2:16:48.200 --> 2:16:52.600]  to really bring what the Martin Luther King stood for and really what the Constitution
[2:16:52.600 --> 2:16:56.360]  stands for into, into the limelight.
[2:16:56.360 --> 2:16:58.040]  What do you think about that?
[2:16:58.040 --> 2:17:02.280]  And do you think that there's a way to organize people electronically with a meetup?
[2:17:02.280 --> 2:17:04.480]  Because I don't want to just tell you, give you a new job.
[2:17:04.480 --> 2:17:06.040]  I want to help you.
[2:17:06.040 --> 2:17:11.160]  I think that, to answer the latter part of your question, the process procedure would
[2:17:11.160 --> 2:17:17.080]  be what I would refer to as kitchen tables kind of organization.
[2:17:17.080 --> 2:17:23.920]  The media is not going to give me or Alex the opportunity to demonstrate what is considered
[2:17:23.920 --> 2:17:26.840]  free speech.
[2:17:26.840 --> 2:17:30.880]  The media only considers free speech that they like.
[2:17:30.880 --> 2:17:35.680]  They consider anything that they don't approve of as hate speech, though you have the freedom
[2:17:35.680 --> 2:17:36.680]  to say it.
[2:17:36.680 --> 2:17:41.400]  But then they say it's hate speech and they try to null and void it and null and void
[2:17:41.400 --> 2:17:43.800]  your constitutional right and say so.
[2:17:43.800 --> 2:17:48.360]  What I would think would be the approach and what must be the approach is that we're going
[2:17:48.360 --> 2:17:53.480]  to have to get Americans around the kitchen table who can then come as family members
[2:17:53.480 --> 2:17:58.800]  or friends and talk about the issues in a real and constructive way.
[2:17:58.800 --> 2:18:05.080]  You can't go on your job if you are an attorney or if you are not a mechanic at Pep Boys.
[2:18:05.080 --> 2:18:08.920]  If you are, if you believe, and if you are against Obama, if you're against all of what's
[2:18:08.920 --> 2:18:15.080]  happening in our nation, you would then get fired from your job or ostracize if you simply
[2:18:15.080 --> 2:18:16.560]  speak your mind.
[2:18:16.560 --> 2:18:20.640]  It has to happen in the confines now of the kitchen table ministry that we've talked about
[2:18:20.640 --> 2:18:21.640]  from time to time.
[2:18:21.640 --> 2:18:24.400]  Absolutely, and people don't listen to mainstream media anymore.
[2:18:24.400 --> 2:18:29.040]  Mainstream metrics, marketing info shows that some big corporations are spending hundreds
[2:18:29.040 --> 2:18:33.520]  of billions in the Western world every year to actually pay focus groups to go out and
[2:18:33.520 --> 2:18:39.760]  talk things up at community events, call into radio to write articles, to write reviews.
[2:18:39.760 --> 2:18:44.080]  That's why all of us that love freedom and love God and love just basic justice, we
[2:18:44.080 --> 2:18:48.120]  have to get active with reviews and calling into shows and going to speak at the city
[2:18:48.120 --> 2:18:50.720]  council or going down a little local church.
[2:18:50.720 --> 2:18:54.280]  If you want to defeat racism and the globalist balkanization, there's big movements to do
[2:18:54.280 --> 2:18:59.920]  this, go to a predominant white church of your black or just a visit or a black church
[2:18:59.920 --> 2:19:06.480]  of your white and break that balkanization they're engaged in.
[2:19:06.480 --> 2:19:10.520]  We should put out a promo piece that shows Martin Luther King saying one thing and then
[2:19:10.520 --> 2:19:13.920]  the globalist saying another thing and just show how they've manipulated it, but speaking
[2:19:13.920 --> 2:19:19.640]  of Obama and his national civilian force, they want this during the collapse.
[2:19:19.640 --> 2:19:24.880]  One out of high school two years compulsory service, but instead it's going to be acorn-like
[2:19:24.880 --> 2:19:31.160]  community organizing political correctness under something called strong cities of the
[2:19:31.160 --> 2:19:37.960]  UN officially announced mainstream news last year, the UN running your local city attached
[2:19:37.960 --> 2:19:38.960]  to federal dollars.
[2:19:38.960 --> 2:19:44.240]  The feds give the money, but you've got to get the seal of approval from the UN and
[2:19:44.240 --> 2:19:48.600]  offices they're opening right now nationwide to run your city.
[2:19:48.600 --> 2:19:50.600]  Let's go to the clip.
[2:19:50.600 --> 2:19:56.280]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security
[2:19:56.280 --> 2:19:58.280]  objectives that we've set.
[2:19:58.280 --> 2:20:04.320]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[2:20:04.320 --> 2:20:05.320]  just as well funded.
[2:20:05.320 --> 2:20:08.480]  And the people expect to see it like a foreign army coming over the hill.
[2:20:08.480 --> 2:20:14.400]  No, it's just suddenly local community groups, government funded, directed by the UN pastramanning.
[2:20:14.400 --> 2:20:17.160]  I just, I can't even believe it's happened.
[2:20:17.160 --> 2:20:20.360]  Now believe it, now believe it.
[2:20:20.360 --> 2:20:26.880]  When you consider the globalist ideology and this one world nation idea, the United Nations
[2:20:26.880 --> 2:20:30.720]  will be the place where the head of the beast would sit.
[2:20:30.720 --> 2:20:35.800]  And so it would start as the process of the strongest nation in America.
[2:20:35.800 --> 2:20:39.520]  That's why the UN building needs to get out of New York City, first of all.
[2:20:39.520 --> 2:20:41.480]  And then the other thing, when they come here, they clog up the streets.
[2:20:41.480 --> 2:20:45.520]  You can't buy a hot dog because traffic is so tight.
[2:20:45.520 --> 2:20:51.440]  But on the other hand, the head of the beast would sit at that building under those auspices.
[2:20:51.440 --> 2:20:58.120]  And by the way, if you ever see a panoramic view of the UN Security Council or the General
[2:20:58.120 --> 2:21:04.120]  Assembly, you'll notice most of the heads of states there are Islamic or something other
[2:21:04.120 --> 2:21:06.600]  than Western or Christian.
[2:21:06.600 --> 2:21:07.600]  That's right.
[2:21:07.600 --> 2:21:11.960]  Saudi Arabia runs the Human Rights Council when they're probably the second most abusive
[2:21:11.960 --> 2:21:14.880]  country in the world after North Korea.
[2:21:14.880 --> 2:21:17.360]  And they run the Rights Council.
[2:21:17.360 --> 2:21:19.240]  I mean, that ought to tell everybody something.
[2:21:19.240 --> 2:21:24.440]  I want to go to a few final calls, but since you mentioned tyranny and who runs this, what
[2:21:24.440 --> 2:21:29.080]  about Obama with Raul Castro, half a million political dissidents, arresting people that
[2:21:29.080 --> 2:21:34.800]  just said Libertay, ESPN celebrated as people were drug away and beat up and thrown in police
[2:21:34.800 --> 2:21:35.800]  cars.
[2:21:35.800 --> 2:21:37.120]  Where's all the liberal groups there?
[2:21:37.120 --> 2:21:38.680]  Oh, I forgot.
[2:21:38.680 --> 2:21:45.440]  Back Lives Matters ideological founder is a cop killer and has been in Cuba since the
[2:21:45.440 --> 2:21:46.440]  80s.
[2:21:46.440 --> 2:21:48.960]  And again, we're not saying there aren't some problems with the police folks, but just
[2:21:48.960 --> 2:21:52.900]  supporting communist movements that want to shoot random cops in the back of the head.
[2:21:52.900 --> 2:21:54.400]  This is crazy.
[2:21:54.400 --> 2:21:55.960]  Her name is Joanne Cheshemar.
[2:21:55.960 --> 2:21:56.960]  Yes.
[2:21:56.960 --> 2:22:04.200]  Killer New Jersey State Patrol, a state patrol officer in the dead of night and then fled
[2:22:04.200 --> 2:22:10.840]  down to Cuba is living a life of luxury and freedom and Cuba being smuggled out and having
[2:22:10.840 --> 2:22:16.720]  boyfriends smuggled in to Cuba from time to time to do what they do to her.
[2:22:16.720 --> 2:22:21.440]  She's living a great life and Obama goes there never mentions her name.
[2:22:21.440 --> 2:22:26.920]  And I haven't heard anybody of no, the presidential state mentioned Joanne Cheshemar name, but
[2:22:26.920 --> 2:22:30.680]  she is a cold, blooded killer.
[2:22:30.680 --> 2:22:35.920]  And I believe she comes back and forth to America from time to time under the auspices
[2:22:35.920 --> 2:22:43.400]  of the Cubans that are in Florida and the Cuban protection that she has in Cuba.
[2:22:43.400 --> 2:22:44.400]  I can't prove it.
[2:22:44.400 --> 2:22:48.320]  Well, look at how they won't even criticize communist China now, but they tell us the
[2:22:48.320 --> 2:22:52.840]  biggest mass murders in history that pastor that we can't have Donald Trump.
[2:22:52.840 --> 2:22:57.080]  Shouldn't Americans say no to being lectured by all these foreign governments, England,
[2:22:57.080 --> 2:23:02.800]  Saudi Arabia, Mexico, that we can't have Donald Trump, that's globalism right there.
[2:23:02.800 --> 2:23:05.200]  Probably what most Americans, at least I did.
[2:23:05.200 --> 2:23:11.240]  I know that Trump is going to pulverize them, their economy.
[2:23:11.240 --> 2:23:16.280]  And he's going to make America great again, as he said, through the economic wheel of
[2:23:16.280 --> 2:23:23.320]  action that he was going to put into play as a result of removing Chinese power and
[2:23:23.320 --> 2:23:25.920]  the jobs that have been shipped to China and India.
[2:23:25.920 --> 2:23:29.600]  And so I really don't see them as a threat anymore.
[2:23:29.600 --> 2:23:35.040]  My prayers right now is to get Trump through the nomination, that process, because he's
[2:23:35.040 --> 2:23:41.280]  got the entire political establishment, both Democrat and Republican, and the media against
[2:23:41.280 --> 2:23:42.280]  him.
[2:23:42.280 --> 2:23:44.280]  If we can get him through this process, I think we'll be home safe.
[2:23:44.280 --> 2:23:45.280]  We're getting you out here in a few minutes.
[2:23:45.280 --> 2:23:47.000]  We're about to go to break with Chairman Tumor.
[2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:50.440]  Let's talk to Robert Missouri, you're on the air with Pastor James David Manning of
[2:23:50.440 --> 2:23:51.440]  otla.org.
[2:23:51.440 --> 2:23:57.000]  Hey, gentlemen, I wanted to run this scenario by both of you.
[2:23:57.000 --> 2:24:02.440]  The United Nations High Committee on Refugees, there's a corporation called Accenture, and
[2:24:02.440 --> 2:24:04.400]  they're contracted with the World Bank as well.
[2:24:04.400 --> 2:24:09.960]  I think they're using this Islamic terror to scare the Europeans into those conversations
[2:24:09.960 --> 2:24:13.000]  that you had with Aaron Russo, Alex, before he died.
[2:24:13.000 --> 2:24:16.120]  Oh yeah, they admitted it's about a castle society, banning free speech, but none of
[2:24:16.120 --> 2:24:17.120]  the Muslims.
[2:24:17.120 --> 2:24:21.360]  And absolutely, Peter Sutherland that runs the refugee program is the creator of the
[2:24:21.360 --> 2:24:25.120]  EU and says, we don't want Western Christians culture.
[2:24:25.120 --> 2:24:26.200]  Go look at his quotes.
[2:24:26.200 --> 2:24:27.720]  They admit it's to destroy Europe.
[2:24:27.720 --> 2:24:29.720]  Go ahead.
[2:24:29.720 --> 2:24:33.760]  And then you guys, with Leo Zagami, which was a great interview, he talked about this
[2:24:33.760 --> 2:24:36.600]  calergy plan, and this is coming to fruition.
[2:24:36.600 --> 2:24:40.280]  They're going to scare these Europeans into the point where they're going to take a biometric
[2:24:40.280 --> 2:24:46.360]  system because they're so scared of the Islamic terror, which I believe is almost gladio part
[2:24:46.360 --> 2:24:47.360]  two.
[2:24:47.360 --> 2:24:50.360]  And I just wanted to throw that at you guys and see what you thought.
[2:24:50.360 --> 2:24:51.360]  That's a great point.
[2:24:51.360 --> 2:24:52.360]  Pastor Manning.
[2:24:52.360 --> 2:24:56.320]  Well, you know, there's several ways of looking at that, but I'd like to look at it through
[2:24:56.320 --> 2:24:58.720]  the eyes of a Trump presidency.
[2:24:58.720 --> 2:25:05.760]  I believe that a Trump presidency would wake up the cousins or wake up our cousins in Europe.
[2:25:05.760 --> 2:25:10.760]  And once we see how wonderfully it is working in America, Angela Merkel will catch the same
[2:25:10.760 --> 2:25:13.240]  vision in Germany.
[2:25:13.240 --> 2:25:15.760]  And there's the same thing in London.
[2:25:15.760 --> 2:25:21.120]  You mentioned earlier on Alex that you were in London and you were taking pictures and
[2:25:21.120 --> 2:25:26.280]  move for a cutaway and some of the Muslims came over and began to yell at you, but you
[2:25:26.280 --> 2:25:28.200]  stood up.
[2:25:28.200 --> 2:25:35.000]  London has been in many of those neighborhoods and I think East London taken over by Islamic
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:36.000]  thought.
[2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:40.080]  But I believe that a Trump presidency using America as a paradigm, we're putting the brakes
[2:25:40.080 --> 2:25:41.960]  on Islam completely.
[2:25:41.960 --> 2:25:47.160]  You might find that the European nations may decide to follow the Trump principle of putting
[2:25:47.160 --> 2:25:52.600]  a break on Muslims also and sending them back to the 22 nations, by the way.
[2:25:52.600 --> 2:25:56.280]  I mean, there are a lot of people without a country, Saudi Arabia hasn't taken one of
[2:25:56.280 --> 2:25:57.280]  them.
[2:25:57.280 --> 2:26:02.320]  Well, you know, you've got 22 nations over there at the Horn of Africa and from Pakistan
[2:26:02.320 --> 2:26:07.520]  all the way back over to Morocco, where they can find habitation and eat their own food
[2:26:07.520 --> 2:26:12.880]  and have their own, if you will, worship centers and not bother us here in America and let
[2:26:12.880 --> 2:26:14.360]  us go on with our Christian ideas.
[2:26:14.360 --> 2:26:15.360]  That's right.
[2:26:15.360 --> 2:26:16.360]  Okay.
[2:26:16.360 --> 2:26:17.360]  One more call.
[2:26:17.360 --> 2:26:18.360]  We're going to let Pastor Manning go.
[2:26:18.360 --> 2:26:19.360]  I'll come back from break.
[2:26:19.360 --> 2:26:20.360]  Get some clips and take more calls.
[2:26:20.360 --> 2:26:21.360]  A lot of great calls here for him.
[2:26:21.360 --> 2:26:23.360]  But no, he's got his own program to do and other things.
[2:26:23.360 --> 2:26:25.640]  Steve in Texas, you're on the air and thanks for holding.
[2:26:25.640 --> 2:26:26.640]  Go ahead.
[2:26:26.640 --> 2:26:33.640]  Yeah, my question is, you know, the, I see really see the church now as the lukewarm
[2:26:33.640 --> 2:26:38.400]  church and it's been cold or hot, I think political correctness is really, you know,
[2:26:38.400 --> 2:26:39.400]  advocated that.
[2:26:39.400 --> 2:26:44.280]  And so we're just standing down and not saying anything and kind of, I was wondering if Pastor
[2:26:44.280 --> 2:26:48.880]  Manning, you thought that Islam is going to become the world religion, that one world
[2:26:48.880 --> 2:26:50.380]  religion.
[2:26:50.380 --> 2:26:54.720]  So the people actually become a slave class to women and children.
[2:26:54.720 --> 2:27:00.680]  No, I don't, I don't, I don't believe Islam does not have the spiritual power to do so.
[2:27:00.680 --> 2:27:05.320]  I think Christianity and the power to work, listen, the church has become lukewarm.
[2:27:05.320 --> 2:27:10.240]  In fact, I'm not sure I want to call many of these organizations churches anymore.
[2:27:10.240 --> 2:27:16.840]  I think their organizations are socially that has some pretext to the Bible, but I think
[2:27:16.840 --> 2:27:21.200]  the strength of salvation preaching against sin, preaching the power to blood of Jesus
[2:27:21.200 --> 2:27:26.920]  is and preaching the church as the womb and bride of Christ is what a church is.
[2:27:26.920 --> 2:27:28.080]  I don't see that happening.
[2:27:28.080 --> 2:27:31.880]  So if it doesn't walk like a duck, talk like a duck, then it ain't a duck.
[2:27:31.880 --> 2:27:32.880]  Sure.
[2:27:32.880 --> 2:27:35.680]  What they do with the world council of churches, it's all declassified with the Rockefellers
[2:27:35.680 --> 2:27:36.680]  last hundred years.
[2:27:36.680 --> 2:27:39.960]  They come in with the seminary control at the top of the church, usually threaten them
[2:27:39.960 --> 2:27:40.960]  or whatever.
[2:27:40.960 --> 2:27:41.960]  That's the problem.
[2:27:41.960 --> 2:27:42.960]  Exactly.
[2:27:42.960 --> 2:27:45.520]  And I mean, please elaborate, come back in a whole show or do a minute on this here in
[2:27:45.520 --> 2:27:46.520]  just a second.
[2:27:46.520 --> 2:27:51.480]  They come in and they go, we've got to incrementally in Christianity, but we do it slowly, claiming
[2:27:51.480 --> 2:27:58.280]  we want to be more inclusive until the first Methodist Church of Austin, Texas basically
[2:27:58.280 --> 2:28:01.560]  is like the most hardcore MSNBC program you've ever seen.
[2:28:01.560 --> 2:28:04.720]  Pastor Manny, can you elaborate on what the world council of churches has done?
[2:28:04.720 --> 2:28:09.200]  Well, what has happened is that we've had this seminary train as you have stated leaders
[2:28:09.200 --> 2:28:16.520]  minute them coming out of what was from the end of World War Two and the influx of a lot
[2:28:16.520 --> 2:28:22.840]  of German theologians who began, especially at the Bonhoeffer, and I'm not against him.
[2:28:22.840 --> 2:28:23.840]  He was against Hitler.
[2:28:23.840 --> 2:28:25.400]  There's no doubt about it.
[2:28:25.400 --> 2:28:31.400]  But most of these seminaries, Alex, that were the training of these world council leaders
[2:28:31.400 --> 2:28:37.120]  and those that get the big positions on world council church leadership have been seminary
[2:28:37.120 --> 2:28:38.120]  trained.
[2:28:38.120 --> 2:28:43.360]  They've been seminary trained by very liberal German theologians whose ideas are incompatible
[2:28:43.360 --> 2:28:45.000]  with Christianity.
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:51.440]  And if, for instance, you take person like James Cohn at Union Theological Seminary,
[2:28:51.440 --> 2:28:56.360]  his black theology has nothing to do with Christ or with the blood of Jesus.
[2:28:56.360 --> 2:29:02.560]  And then he influenced a person like Jeremiah Wright, who later in Ford Foundation, it's
[2:29:02.560 --> 2:29:07.720]  declassified, did it so people wouldn't have identities of Christ and freedom and family.
[2:29:07.720 --> 2:29:11.920]  The identity is being race baited and controlled and upset, right?
[2:29:11.920 --> 2:29:12.920]  Yes.
[2:29:12.920 --> 2:29:18.200]  And so that's why you've got the world council of churches being as liberal as it is.
[2:29:18.200 --> 2:29:23.840]  And we're not even having, lukewarm churches might be, we might be able to tolerate them.
[2:29:23.840 --> 2:29:27.400]  We have very few churches that are preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ biblically
[2:29:27.400 --> 2:29:28.400]  these days.
[2:29:28.400 --> 2:29:29.400]  All right.
[2:29:29.400 --> 2:29:30.400]  Very, very few.
[2:29:30.400 --> 2:29:33.640]  Well, we know Ott was doing it online on every Wednesday night and every Sunday and every
[2:29:33.640 --> 2:29:38.360]  day serving bills to the poor and others, Ott-la-a-t-l-a-h dot o-r-g.
[2:29:38.360 --> 2:29:41.080]  Pastor James Hibbett Manning, we salute you, we love you.
[2:29:41.080 --> 2:29:42.080]  God bless you.
[2:29:42.080 --> 2:29:43.600]  We'll see you again soon, my friend.
[2:29:43.600 --> 2:29:44.600]  We love you, Alex.
[2:29:44.600 --> 2:29:45.600]  God keep you going to work.
[2:29:45.600 --> 2:29:46.600]  Keep on going.
[2:29:46.600 --> 2:29:47.600]  Thank you.
[2:29:47.600 --> 2:29:48.600]  We're all this together, brother.
[2:29:48.600 --> 2:29:49.600]  We're going to be back.
[2:29:49.600 --> 2:29:50.600]  Thank you, sir.
[2:29:50.600 --> 2:29:51.600]  We're on the march.
[2:29:51.600 --> 2:29:52.600]  The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:52.600 --> 2:30:18.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:18.720 --> 2:30:24.360]  We need to be forceful, we can't have these muted responses to terror.
[2:30:24.360 --> 2:30:29.040]  And let me also say this about Donald Trump, you know, we trash him often here.
[2:30:29.040 --> 2:30:34.800]  Bottom line is in January, and you've been saying that, Raven, in January of this year,
[2:30:34.800 --> 2:30:36.960]  he said Brussels was a hellhole.
[2:30:36.960 --> 2:30:41.120]  He said there is something going on, Maria, and it is not good talking about Belgium.
[2:30:41.120 --> 2:30:42.120]  He was right.
[2:30:42.120 --> 2:30:43.120]  So he's right on a couple of things.
[2:30:43.120 --> 2:30:45.600]  So his foreign policy isn't so outrageous.
[2:30:45.600 --> 2:30:50.800]  So is Donald Trump really the voice of reason, and which candidate makes you feel safer?
[2:30:50.800 --> 2:30:53.440]  Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton?
[2:30:53.440 --> 2:30:58.120]  Let us know what you think in the comment section right now at Infowars.com.
[2:30:58.120 --> 2:31:02.800]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[2:31:02.800 --> 2:31:08.040]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[2:31:08.040 --> 2:31:11.200]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[2:31:11.200 --> 2:31:13.160]  Just one of the key compounds.
[2:31:13.160 --> 2:31:16.480]  The ILPQQ is backed by major clinical studies.

[2:32:03.800 --> 2:32:08.320]  and purchase your supply of Survival Shield X2 Nacin iodine and all the great products
[2:32:08.320 --> 2:32:09.320]  at Infowarslife.com.
[2:32:09.320 --> 2:32:13.800]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists
[2:32:13.800 --> 2:32:19.800]  and the answer is clear, iodine is key, is paramount and there's still so much new information
[2:32:19.800 --> 2:32:22.840]  coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[2:32:22.840 --> 2:32:28.280]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these
[2:32:28.280 --> 2:32:31.760]  purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[2:32:31.760 --> 2:32:35.680]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[2:32:35.680 --> 2:32:38.640]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[2:32:38.640 --> 2:32:43.280]  And frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of Survival Shield Nacin iodine, that major
[2:32:43.280 --> 2:32:47.360]  brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula and that
[2:32:47.360 --> 2:32:51.440]  they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[2:32:51.440 --> 2:33:17.440]  It is exclusive to Infowarslife.com and the Infowarslife family of incredible products.
[2:33:17.440 --> 2:33:43.440]  It is exclusive to Infowarslife.com and the Infowarslife family of incredible products.
[2:33:43.440 --> 2:33:51.800]  11 a.m., 3 p.m. Central, Anthony Gucciardi, Infowars health and wellness expert, will
[2:33:51.800 --> 2:33:56.240]  be hosting in the fourth hour, but he's also really informative on news, politics, state
[2:33:56.240 --> 2:34:00.280]  of the world, you name it.
[2:34:00.280 --> 2:34:16.480]  And he will be hosting the fourth hour.
[2:34:16.480 --> 2:34:21.480]  I love this line, I'll give you television.
[2:34:21.480 --> 2:34:25.480]  When I said I was sad that David Bowie was dead, people said, that guy's a big liberal
[2:34:25.480 --> 2:34:26.480]  weirdo.
[2:34:26.480 --> 2:34:32.000]  You know, why are you sad he's dead?
[2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:35.400]  I mean, I don't care, I like people's music, I like their art and I'm sad when anybody
[2:34:35.400 --> 2:34:40.760]  dies unless it's like Joe Stalin or Mao Zedong or Adolf Hitler.
[2:34:40.760 --> 2:34:50.400]  See, I want people to be free.
[2:34:50.400 --> 2:34:52.320]  I'm a real liberal.
[2:34:52.320 --> 2:34:56.040]  He kind of explained that to everybody.
[2:34:56.040 --> 2:35:00.440]  So if you're a mainline establishment conservative and you want everybody to conform to a certain
[2:35:00.440 --> 2:35:03.760]  little box, that's not who I am.
[2:35:03.760 --> 2:35:06.200]  I want people to leave kids alone.
[2:35:06.200 --> 2:35:07.560]  I want low taxes.
[2:35:07.560 --> 2:35:09.120]  I want fair trade deals.
[2:35:09.120 --> 2:35:10.840]  I want national sovereignty.
[2:35:10.840 --> 2:35:13.040]  I want to honor the human species.
[2:35:13.040 --> 2:35:16.520]  That means men and women and children.
[2:35:16.520 --> 2:35:20.680]  It is the control left that wants to control language and dumb everybody down.
[2:35:20.680 --> 2:35:27.680]  And it's the controlled establishment right that over and over and over and over and over
[2:35:27.680 --> 2:35:33.160]  and over and over and over again goes out there and bosses everybody around and tries
[2:35:33.160 --> 2:35:40.640]  to bring in their own tyranny that is a monotheistic tyranny, not of Christ, because Christ isn't
[2:35:40.640 --> 2:35:45.760]  a tyranny, to choice and a relationship.
[2:35:45.760 --> 2:35:53.520]  But a monotheistic tyranny of the establishment and only one wing of the same oppression.
[2:35:53.520 --> 2:35:55.080]  And that's where I'm coming from on that.
[2:35:55.080 --> 2:35:59.160]  We have the right to write what we want, say what we want, do what we want as long as it
[2:35:59.160 --> 2:36:02.200]  doesn't hurt anybody else.
[2:36:02.200 --> 2:36:05.640]  But then you have the right to tell somebody you think they're wrong.
[2:36:05.640 --> 2:36:11.040]  And then if I disagree with you, it doesn't mean I'm saying I hate you.
[2:36:11.040 --> 2:36:12.440]  It just means I have a different view.
[2:36:12.440 --> 2:36:17.920]  How many liberals who aren't liberal, they use that term, they look at me and they say,
[2:36:17.920 --> 2:36:19.560]  you attacked me back from my views.
[2:36:19.560 --> 2:36:21.560]  You're trying to suppress my views.
[2:36:21.560 --> 2:36:27.040]  No, when I respond back to you and they have different radical Muslim grips online, trying
[2:36:27.040 --> 2:36:31.560]  to get our YouTube channel shut down right now, filing all sorts of fake complaints, we're
[2:36:31.560 --> 2:36:38.460]  getting ready to do a big report on it, foreign government media outlets from Turkey and others
[2:36:38.460 --> 2:36:45.480]  that really want to get in a lawsuit and others.
[2:36:45.480 --> 2:36:50.000]  And they think it's all about running everyone over and making everybody submit to their
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:51.320]  worldview.
[2:36:51.320 --> 2:36:55.240]  That dog isn't going to hunt here anymore.
[2:36:55.240 --> 2:37:02.040]  And you and all your buddies and you and all the establishment minions and all the weird
[2:37:02.040 --> 2:37:08.640]  kleptocratic, oppressive, fake left people, fake Renaissance people that point at culture
[2:37:08.640 --> 2:37:11.440]  and society and claim they built all this.
[2:37:11.440 --> 2:37:15.480]  Obama just doesn't say you didn't build your business and government did.
[2:37:15.480 --> 2:37:17.600]  They also act like they built culture.
[2:37:17.600 --> 2:37:18.600]  They built art.
[2:37:18.600 --> 2:37:23.120]  They are the reason there's all these beautiful and wonderful things because they always associate
[2:37:23.120 --> 2:37:25.480]  themselves with them.
[2:37:25.480 --> 2:37:28.040]  The truth is, big government gives you Cuba.
[2:37:28.040 --> 2:37:34.520]  It gives you North Korea and I want to go to your calls on the news, but I tell you,
[2:37:34.520 --> 2:37:41.400]  it really hit me the last three, four days when Obama was in Cuba for two days, knowing
[2:37:41.400 --> 2:37:45.480]  what's in Cuba, talking to people that have been there and worked there, even leftist.
[2:37:45.480 --> 2:37:48.440]  I mean, most of the houses have caved in.
[2:37:48.440 --> 2:37:51.520]  There are no new cars that anybody built.
[2:37:51.520 --> 2:37:54.080]  Most of the cars are from the 40s and 50s.
[2:37:54.080 --> 2:38:01.000]  The public work as slaves, farmers and fishermen and people might get to keep 10 percent of
[2:38:01.000 --> 2:38:03.080]  what they produce.
[2:38:03.080 --> 2:38:08.640]  There's all these little spoiled, rotten children of the revolution whose parents were the party
[2:38:08.640 --> 2:38:11.160]  officials who are now the party officials.
[2:38:11.160 --> 2:38:17.440]  It's handed in a hereditary way down and the people look at America, the flower of the
[2:38:17.440 --> 2:38:20.320]  Renaissance and go, it's about being white.
[2:38:20.320 --> 2:38:23.640]  It's about being entitled undoubtedly.
[2:38:23.640 --> 2:38:27.880]  If you were from the right family in the right town and the right universities and the right
[2:38:27.880 --> 2:38:32.640]  sororities and the right fraternities and had the right looks, you would be given positions
[2:38:32.640 --> 2:38:33.640]  of power.
[2:38:33.640 --> 2:38:39.960]  But America was about getting away from that, away from the crown, away from lords, away
[2:38:39.960 --> 2:38:44.240]  from foreign governors.
[2:38:44.240 --> 2:38:48.400]  George Washington's biggest reason for wanting to be in the war was that he was one of the
[2:38:48.400 --> 2:38:56.120]  best soldiers in that colony and led huge groups of other soldiers that won huge victories
[2:38:56.120 --> 2:39:02.920]  and was an advisor and a scout to mainline British troops for 20 plus years.
[2:39:02.920 --> 2:39:04.920]  Really it's close to 30.
[2:39:04.920 --> 2:39:07.760]  And he got about 10 percent, 20 percent of the pay they got.
[2:39:07.760 --> 2:39:09.840]  He was treated by CRUD.
[2:39:09.840 --> 2:39:14.640]  If he wanted to even be able to go to dinner with some of them to try to get a better contractor
[2:39:14.640 --> 2:39:19.720]  or a better job, he had to arrive in the perfect green or black carriage that he had to buy
[2:39:19.720 --> 2:39:20.920]  from London.
[2:39:20.920 --> 2:39:23.400]  You weren't allowed to produce it in the US.
[2:39:23.400 --> 2:39:24.400]  That was law.
[2:39:24.400 --> 2:39:28.400]  He had to have the perfect clothes made in London or France, not allowed to be made in
[2:39:28.400 --> 2:39:30.400]  the colonies.
[2:39:30.400 --> 2:39:32.080]  He couldn't go buy property himself.
[2:39:32.080 --> 2:39:34.840]  He had to go to a lord and do it under him.
[2:39:34.840 --> 2:39:39.680]  He was basically a high powered slave.
[2:39:39.680 --> 2:39:43.040]  He could not do what they could do.
[2:39:43.040 --> 2:39:47.120]  And so he envisioned his slaves not being slaves and wrote about it.
[2:39:47.120 --> 2:39:51.640]  He envisioned himself not being second class citizen of the British.
[2:39:51.640 --> 2:39:56.440]  And he was sick of the arrogant British officers shooting their mouths off and acting tough
[2:39:56.440 --> 2:39:59.840]  in front of a lot better men.
[2:39:59.840 --> 2:40:05.240]  And so he led an army in a six year war, three to one, five to one, ten to one at some times,
[2:40:05.240 --> 2:40:10.800]  including giant Hessian armies of German slave soldiers who had so much free to core they
[2:40:10.800 --> 2:40:12.440]  didn't even know they were slaves.
[2:40:12.440 --> 2:40:13.760]  They knew they were slaves.
[2:40:13.760 --> 2:40:20.520]  They were proud of the slave collars they wore around their neck because they were ceremonial.
[2:40:20.520 --> 2:40:27.680]  They were such proud slaves that they didn't even need to be chained up at night.
[2:40:27.680 --> 2:40:30.000]  But you know what happened?
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:37.800]  They never had German really Prussian and other defectors in other major campaigns around
[2:40:37.800 --> 2:40:45.240]  Europe, but they had major desertions in the colonies because there were so many German
[2:40:45.240 --> 2:40:46.240]  immigrants here.
[2:40:46.240 --> 2:40:53.280]  They were probably the second biggest ethnic group at that time, even above Irish or Scottish.
[2:40:53.280 --> 2:40:56.240]  Depending on the area, New York would be the Dutch with the second most prominent group.
[2:40:56.240 --> 2:40:58.680]  And they speak to them in German and say, you're crazy.
[2:40:58.680 --> 2:40:59.680]  You're a slave.
[2:40:59.680 --> 2:41:00.680]  You're an idiot.
[2:41:00.680 --> 2:41:02.800]  You're totally controlled in that fancy uniform.
[2:41:02.800 --> 2:41:05.120]  Throw that off right now.
[2:41:05.120 --> 2:41:07.560]  I got daughters that, you know, that need a good man.
[2:41:07.560 --> 2:41:09.440]  Join our community right here.
[2:41:09.440 --> 2:41:13.360]  And by the way, once they joined, it's in the history books within a few weeks, they usually
[2:41:13.360 --> 2:41:18.720]  took up arms.
[2:41:18.720 --> 2:41:22.720]  America is where so much of the freedom started, then they pointed our problems because the
[2:41:22.720 --> 2:41:25.880]  public's ignorant and don't know much of it started here.
[2:41:25.880 --> 2:41:30.520]  Most of it started here and in England in 1215, I'm going to go to your calls in the
[2:41:30.520 --> 2:41:31.520]  news.
[2:41:31.520 --> 2:41:36.440]  It's just so frustrating to see the public completely ignorant about the history of this
[2:41:36.440 --> 2:41:42.480]  country or where it really came from or what went on.
[2:41:42.480 --> 2:41:52.440]  Imagine that George Washington couldn't go on a boat to England, but she never did when
[2:41:52.440 --> 2:41:53.440]  he was a young man.
[2:41:53.440 --> 2:41:58.360]  But he could have to get a pair of boots because then there was an import tax bill to
[2:41:58.360 --> 2:42:00.560]  bring it back into the colony.
[2:42:00.560 --> 2:42:05.920]  So if he tried to buy the pair of boots that he had to have to be accepted at one of the
[2:42:05.920 --> 2:42:10.920]  clubs to do business, talk about discriminatory 99.
[2:42:10.920 --> 2:42:16.080]  Whatever percent and it was more than 99% of white people could not get in those dinner
[2:42:16.080 --> 2:42:19.000]  clubs with the English gentleman.
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:24.080]  If you didn't have an English last name, you could hardly get into it unless you had German
[2:42:24.080 --> 2:42:29.280]  letters behind your name from a university or French letters.
[2:42:29.280 --> 2:42:37.480]  If you were a doctor or a doctor of philosophy, then and you had the proper dress, then you
[2:42:37.480 --> 2:42:41.920]  could get into one of those private club meetings.
[2:42:41.920 --> 2:42:47.200]  You're sitting around talking about white privilege folks, give me a break.
[2:42:47.200 --> 2:42:50.000]  Maybe 2% of the South owned slaves.
[2:42:50.000 --> 2:42:54.920]  The real racism came when it ended because then the whites had to compete in some cases
[2:42:54.920 --> 2:43:00.160]  with half the population being black and the whites were already almost starving to death
[2:43:00.160 --> 2:43:03.600]  or starving to death as sharecroppers, no fault of the black slaves.
[2:43:03.600 --> 2:43:10.480]  And now they were starving to death because half the population was black in many areas
[2:43:10.480 --> 2:43:15.480]  of the South and they didn't have any place to live or any jobs anymore.
[2:43:15.480 --> 2:43:20.760]  See, these are the real histories no one's taught because they want to keep us all at
[2:43:20.760 --> 2:43:28.360]  each other's throats and they use total ignorance to sell the entire thing and I'm sick of it.
[2:43:28.360 --> 2:43:31.520]  You ought to read George Washington's letters where he would just groan having to spend
[2:43:31.520 --> 2:43:35.960]  almost all his money trying to get the right carriage or the right boots and how foppish
[2:43:35.960 --> 2:43:41.800]  it was, how dandy it was, which means, you know, like a feminine, just like a soldier
[2:43:41.800 --> 2:43:47.840]  tough guy, you know, six months out in the brush, you know, fighting, comes back, he's
[2:43:47.840 --> 2:43:51.880]  squared off all this land, he wants to be able to get a piece of it for himself because
[2:43:51.880 --> 2:43:55.280]  he's not part of the crown.
[2:43:55.280 --> 2:43:58.080]  He can't even get property for himself.
[2:43:58.080 --> 2:44:07.920]  He has to go and sell the land that he's just almost died for fighting the French for to
[2:44:07.920 --> 2:44:09.920]  someone above him who then just basically steals it.
[2:44:09.920 --> 2:44:11.440]  Oh, thank you for all this here.
[2:44:11.440 --> 2:44:14.080]  I get a hundred gold coins, you get one.
[2:44:14.080 --> 2:44:17.080]  That's why George Washington did what he did because he was being discriminated against
[2:44:17.080 --> 2:44:19.520]  and you go, oh, well, I bet he was stealing land from some native group.
[2:44:19.520 --> 2:44:22.720]  Let me tell you, natives were just as bad as the French for anybody else.
[2:44:22.720 --> 2:44:25.000]  I'm not saying worse, just as bad.
[2:44:25.000 --> 2:44:27.200]  You'll see the Revenant.
[2:44:27.200 --> 2:44:28.400]  That's a very accurate movie.
[2:44:28.400 --> 2:44:36.040]  As far as it goes with the natives, one tribe might be honorable and sweet as pie.
[2:44:36.040 --> 2:44:40.000]  Next tribe totally psychotic, whacked out on the loose engines constantly running around
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:44.280]  murdering everybody and they would come to your little hut or wherever and say, you're
[2:44:44.280 --> 2:44:46.960]  going to give me guns and powder and you're going to go help me kill these neighbors
[2:44:46.960 --> 2:44:49.960]  I don't like or I'm going to kill you.
[2:44:49.960 --> 2:44:53.480]  So you'd go join them in the expansion.
[2:44:53.480 --> 2:44:56.520]  The natives got screwed over because they didn't stick together.
[2:44:56.520 --> 2:44:58.020]  You talk about racist.
[2:44:58.020 --> 2:45:03.480]  They were the most tribal modern term racist people you could imagine, Native Americans.
[2:45:03.480 --> 2:45:09.280]  And by the way, interesting people, amazing in many respects, neat culture, I am proud
[2:45:09.280 --> 2:45:14.920]  of my Native American roots on my dad's side, just you name it, three different backgrounds,
[2:45:14.920 --> 2:45:19.840]  very different, Seminole, Comanche and Cherokee.
[2:45:19.840 --> 2:45:23.600]  And of course, Seminole, for those that don't know, is part of one of the big trail of tears.
[2:45:23.600 --> 2:45:28.040]  They were really out of Oklahoma too, sent down and North Texas, sent into Florida.
[2:45:28.040 --> 2:45:30.640]  Well, those Seminole Indians, most of them are really out of Oklahoma.
[2:45:30.640 --> 2:45:31.640]  They just call them Seminals.
[2:45:31.640 --> 2:45:34.400]  Those are the locals call them because they're in the Seminals, swam.
[2:45:34.400 --> 2:45:39.800]  I mean, my dad didn't go to reservations where they're sitting there with tourists watching
[2:45:39.800 --> 2:45:40.800]  them.
[2:45:40.800 --> 2:45:42.800]  My dad, when he was a kid, went to the real reservations.
[2:45:42.800 --> 2:45:47.840]  You know, people dancing for two days, and his grandpa and grandma would go back into
[2:45:47.840 --> 2:45:51.000]  town and were like, you know, some of the leaders of the town and everybody else.
[2:45:51.000 --> 2:45:53.720]  But let me tell you, they went pretty wild.
[2:45:53.720 --> 2:45:54.800]  Dance around two days around the fire.
[2:45:54.800 --> 2:45:55.800]  You get wild too.
[2:45:55.800 --> 2:45:56.800]  Wonder what they were doing.
[2:45:56.800 --> 2:46:01.320]  See, I don't just sit up here with all this fake liberal garbage around me and go, Oh,
[2:46:01.320 --> 2:46:02.320]  the natives.
[2:46:02.320 --> 2:46:03.320]  Oh, they're so perfect.
[2:46:03.320 --> 2:46:04.320]  Oh, they're so good.
[2:46:04.320 --> 2:46:05.320]  Oh, they're so.
[2:46:05.320 --> 2:46:13.320]  A load of baloney.
[2:46:13.320 --> 2:46:14.320]  Absolute bull.
[2:46:14.320 --> 2:46:19.520]  I remember when I was a kid, my dad told me about Kwanah Parker and all sorts of family
[2:46:19.520 --> 2:46:20.520]  stories and stuff.
[2:46:20.520 --> 2:46:23.120]  You going on these trendy bars, they got Kwanah Parker all the place.
[2:46:23.120 --> 2:46:27.160]  If I told them the stories my grandma told me, my dad's grandmother, she was 103, had
[2:46:27.160 --> 2:46:28.160]  the name Moon.
[2:46:28.160 --> 2:46:29.920]  That's how Indian she was.
[2:46:29.920 --> 2:46:32.040]  These trainees would fall down on the ground and start worshiping.
[2:46:32.040 --> 2:46:35.840]  I mean, these people have no idea what's all around them, the history, Indiana.
[2:46:35.840 --> 2:46:37.720]  They just know they hate America.
[2:46:37.720 --> 2:46:38.800]  They hate free market.
[2:46:38.800 --> 2:46:39.800]  They hate wealth.
[2:46:39.800 --> 2:46:40.800]  They hate power.
[2:46:40.800 --> 2:46:41.800]  They hate success.
[2:46:41.800 --> 2:46:51.800]  They hate all the choices that they got from this Renaissance culture that's now captured
[2:46:51.800 --> 2:46:57.480]  and has now been taken control of by globalists that hate us as we go out doing all their
[2:46:57.480 --> 2:47:07.520]  dirty work to bring in the planetary world government.
[2:47:07.520 --> 2:47:11.040]  They got it all figured out and Manning said it perfectly.
[2:47:11.040 --> 2:47:13.920]  I went too far defending the Muslims before and got criticized for it.
[2:47:13.920 --> 2:47:17.000]  I admit it, that when I used to just totally defend it and try to stop it, because I didn't
[2:47:17.000 --> 2:47:18.720]  want the class of civilizations to happen.
[2:47:18.720 --> 2:47:21.080]  The class of civilizations is here.
[2:47:21.080 --> 2:47:24.560]  And now I'm not dealing with Muslims that want to go to the university and be doctors
[2:47:24.560 --> 2:47:28.640]  and want to be successful and are smart people.
[2:47:28.640 --> 2:47:34.800]  I'm dealing with the Wahhabist and the people that invaded Syria and murdered all those folks
[2:47:34.800 --> 2:47:38.120]  now coming here looking at me like they want to kill me.
[2:47:38.120 --> 2:47:39.120]  They feel inadequate.
[2:47:39.120 --> 2:47:40.120]  They don't feel wealthy.
[2:47:40.120 --> 2:47:44.120]  They're in the middle of all this, like a stranger in a strange land, like a Martian
[2:47:44.120 --> 2:47:49.200]  come to earth and they are angry and the left is there to fill them full of hatred of America
[2:47:49.200 --> 2:47:53.960]  and everybody else and they are taking the bait.
[2:47:53.960 --> 2:47:58.520]  But my real discuss is with the fake feminists, the foundations, the liberals who hate this
[2:47:58.520 --> 2:48:08.000]  country and freedom and Christians so much, they love radical Muslims.
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:17.640]  But I tell you, there is nobody more oppressive, more weird, more retinive and cloistered and
[2:48:17.640 --> 2:48:24.040]  fidgeting and weird and perverted and pervy, seedy, creepy than the Wahhabist.
[2:48:24.040 --> 2:48:26.040]  I mean, they make my skin crawl.
[2:48:26.040 --> 2:48:30.160]  It's like when you see a pedophile on TV that's been caught with like little kids or
[2:48:30.160 --> 2:48:35.920]  something and you just, they look real sick and potbellied and demonic, they have little
[2:48:35.920 --> 2:48:36.920]  skinny arms.
[2:48:36.920 --> 2:48:37.920]  That wasn't the same.
[2:48:37.920 --> 2:48:40.320]  I don't care if they're black, white, whatever.
[2:48:40.320 --> 2:48:41.320]  They look the same.
[2:48:41.320 --> 2:48:44.640]  There's something about them and your skin crawls.
[2:48:44.640 --> 2:48:49.400]  When I look at the royal Saudis and I look at all those people and I look at the al-Qaeda
[2:48:49.400 --> 2:48:51.120]  and ISIS, my skin crawls.
[2:48:51.120 --> 2:48:56.920]  It's like this ISIS guy on TV bragging how he wants Islam to take over and how great
[2:48:56.920 --> 2:48:57.920]  it is.
[2:48:57.920 --> 2:48:59.080]  He has this sick demonic look in his eye.
[2:48:59.080 --> 2:49:00.240]  He looks really weak.
[2:49:00.240 --> 2:49:04.760]  He's got that beard I want to pull out and I want to just climb in a ring with him and
[2:49:04.760 --> 2:49:08.440]  say, you're a real man, here's a hatchet, I got one now.
[2:49:08.440 --> 2:49:09.680]  Let's just see what happens, punk.
[2:49:09.680 --> 2:49:13.840]  And it's not that I'm even a tough guy looking for trouble and I'm saying figuratively here
[2:49:13.840 --> 2:49:18.520]  at an instinctive level, I want to ram my head into his and say, you want to bang heads
[2:49:18.520 --> 2:49:19.520]  with me?
[2:49:19.520 --> 2:49:20.520]  Let's just see who'll ram heads harder.
[2:49:20.520 --> 2:49:21.520]  Okay?
[2:49:21.520 --> 2:49:22.520]  Let's just find out right now.
[2:49:22.520 --> 2:49:27.240]  You want to praise all this crap going on and people getting blown up at an American
[2:49:27.240 --> 2:49:29.200]  Airlines ticket counter in a cowardly way.
[2:49:29.200 --> 2:49:32.960]  I'm sick of how they think it's trendy and cool and how you wear these diaper outfits
[2:49:32.960 --> 2:49:37.880]  all over the place around our culture with our spacecraft and our reactors and all of
[2:49:37.880 --> 2:49:41.840]  our good stuff that God gave us.
[2:49:41.840 --> 2:49:46.800]  You like to push women around while the feminists parade around all day and lecture the West
[2:49:46.800 --> 2:49:51.200]  that holds women up to the highest level and then these spoiled rotten women of the West
[2:49:51.200 --> 2:49:57.640]  look at men of the West and tell us, we've got a problem, we did something to women.
[2:49:57.640 --> 2:49:58.640]  That is ridiculous.
[2:49:58.640 --> 2:50:03.640]  Yeah, I'm going to go to break, take off for a few seconds and see if he's taken over.
[2:50:03.640 --> 2:50:04.640]  I'm starting to get mad.
[2:50:04.640 --> 2:50:05.640]  I can't do it because I'm going to get too exhausted.
[2:50:05.640 --> 2:50:07.280]  I got a lot of stuff coming up.
[2:50:07.280 --> 2:50:14.240]  I'm going to take part of an original show for the Easter event that's coming up this
[2:50:14.240 --> 2:50:15.240]  Sunday, four to six PM.
[2:50:15.240 --> 2:50:18.040]  I'm going to take some of that today and tomorrow and some of it will be best stuff.
[2:50:18.040 --> 2:50:21.560]  That'll be four to six PM Sunday and I'm going to be shooting a lot of reports throughout
[2:50:21.560 --> 2:50:22.560]  the deal.
[2:50:22.560 --> 2:50:24.080]  I'm going to break here.
[2:50:24.080 --> 2:50:25.080]  Just we need funding.
[2:50:25.080 --> 2:50:27.280]  Obviously, we don't want to just stay the same size or implode.
[2:50:27.280 --> 2:50:30.400]  You either get bigger, you get smaller, big fishy little fish.
[2:50:30.400 --> 2:50:34.320]  We had a lot of great specials and full wars live.com right now.
[2:50:34.320 --> 2:50:37.360]  We have deep cleanse that has the zeolites, the chelogy, all of it.
[2:50:37.360 --> 2:50:40.400]  You can just take without doing a big cleanse, just put it in your water every day.
[2:50:40.400 --> 2:50:41.400]  Absolute amazing cleansers.
[2:50:41.400 --> 2:50:42.400]  Just go check it out for yourself.
[2:50:42.400 --> 2:50:43.400]  Read the reviews.
[2:50:43.400 --> 2:50:45.120]  The liver shield is discounted with it today.
[2:50:45.120 --> 2:50:51.200]  20% off and you get all three of them together with the oxy powder as well and just look.
[2:50:51.200 --> 2:50:55.600]  If you flood me with funds and get high quality products, you'll energize the operation.
[2:50:55.600 --> 2:50:58.240]  We will rise up and do a huge creature and smash the enemy.
[2:50:58.240 --> 2:50:59.960]  That's how it works.

[2:51:07.960 --> 2:51:09.560]  of dollars of profits.

[2:51:38.440 --> 2:51:42.400]  Traditional control agents contain toxic chemicals which do more harm than good.

[2:52:04.120 --> 2:52:07.120]  Your body's primary metabolic function is to make protein.
[2:52:07.120 --> 2:52:10.120]  One World Way is a unique, non-denatured protein.
[2:52:10.120 --> 2:52:14.560]  This enables your body to have virtually 100% utilization, whereas typical whey protein
[2:52:14.560 --> 2:52:18.440]  powders offer no more than 18% utilization of protein.
[2:52:18.440 --> 2:52:21.560]  One World Way also delivers life-giving frequencies to your cells.
[2:52:21.560 --> 2:52:26.280]  The net result for so many people is improved energy, mood and elimination of pain from

[2:52:31.360 --> 2:52:36.960]  I'm 36 years old and for the past several years I've been struggling with lack of energy,
[2:52:36.960 --> 2:52:37.960]  dryness and stamina.
[2:52:37.960 --> 2:52:41.960]  And after just two weeks on this product I'm feeling so much more energy.
[2:52:41.960 --> 2:52:46.560]  My yoga practice has deepened and as a massage therapist I'm able to see more clients than
[2:52:46.560 --> 2:52:48.120]  I've been able to in years.
[2:52:48.120 --> 2:52:51.320]  I've never felt results that quick with anything I've ever taken.

[2:52:56.120 --> 2:52:58.560]  That's oneworldwhey.com.
[2:52:58.560 --> 2:53:06.640]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a select quote agent with a true story of how select quote goes
[2:53:06.640 --> 2:53:09.640]  to bat for you by in term life insurance.
[2:53:09.640 --> 2:53:13.320]  A while back a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[2:53:13.320 --> 2:53:17.560]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[2:53:17.560 --> 2:53:19.120]  I said, let me see.
[2:53:19.120 --> 2:53:23.920]  Well I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly rated, price competitive
[2:53:23.920 --> 2:53:29.080]  companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what
[2:53:29.080 --> 2:53:30.640]  he had been quoted.
[2:53:30.640 --> 2:53:35.760]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience
[2:53:35.760 --> 2:53:42.680]  and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.
[2:53:42.680 --> 2:53:43.680]  How about you?
[2:53:43.680 --> 2:53:56.800]  For your free quote, call 1-800-654-1632 or go to selectquote.com.
[2:53:56.800 --> 2:53:58.520]  We shop, you save.
[2:53:58.520 --> 2:54:06.600]  I don't know folks who are holding for past remaining, but obviously after an hour and
[2:54:06.600 --> 2:54:08.320]  a half he had to make the jump into hyperspace.
[2:54:08.320 --> 2:54:12.760]  I could have kept him longer, but he's got his own ministry to run and thinks he's a
[2:54:12.760 --> 2:54:13.760]  guy.
[2:54:13.760 --> 2:54:18.480]  You see, Pastor Manning and I may have different colored skin, but that's really about it.
[2:54:18.480 --> 2:54:20.080]  He wants freedom.
[2:54:20.080 --> 2:54:21.080]  He doesn't like tyranny.
[2:54:21.080 --> 2:54:24.040]  He wants to see us empowered and wealthy and successful.
[2:54:24.040 --> 2:54:26.560]  He wants us to have religious freedom.
[2:54:26.560 --> 2:54:32.240]  That's truly classical liberalism that Thomas Jefferson pushed, not what we're facing today.
[2:54:32.240 --> 2:54:36.600]  And Rudolph Giuliani's come out and told the truth, Hillary Clinton could be considered
[2:54:36.600 --> 2:54:38.080]  a founding member of ISIS.
[2:54:38.080 --> 2:54:43.160]  And the fact that we first exposed ISIS and al-Qaeda to be Western run and then countless
[2:54:43.160 --> 2:54:47.360]  others came out and exposed it now means people like him can expose Hillary for that
[2:54:47.360 --> 2:54:48.840]  and so can Trump.
[2:54:48.840 --> 2:54:51.680]  And that's the type of job you as listeners are doing.
[2:54:51.680 --> 2:54:52.880]  That's why you're the tip of the spear.
[2:54:52.880 --> 2:54:55.240]  You're the most important.
[2:54:55.240 --> 2:54:59.640]  We are the most important because we're willing to say it when nobody else will up front because
[2:54:59.640 --> 2:55:02.720]  it's the truth to make it safe for others to say it.
[2:55:02.720 --> 2:55:04.120]  Take Trump.
[2:55:04.120 --> 2:55:09.080]  A month after the interview went viral, he tweeted it today, interview breaks down how
[2:55:09.080 --> 2:55:12.400]  Koch brothers are controlling the Republic of Establishment.
[2:55:12.400 --> 2:55:17.240]  And Trump tweeted out about that a month later and it's all over the nose and the media is
[2:55:17.240 --> 2:55:20.640]  criticizing Trump for sending out an info or tweet.
[2:55:20.640 --> 2:55:22.320]  You see, that's how that works.
[2:55:22.320 --> 2:55:24.280]  Well, get this media.
[2:55:24.280 --> 2:55:26.720]  We don't need Trump to send our stuff out for it to get out.
[2:55:26.720 --> 2:55:27.720]  You understand how that works?
[2:55:27.720 --> 2:55:29.840]  Let's go to some calls this segment the next.
[2:55:29.840 --> 2:55:30.840]  Tom, I apologize.
[2:55:30.840 --> 2:55:31.840]  Tom, I didn't see you.
[2:55:31.840 --> 2:55:34.880]  You're calling from London or I would have gone to you sooner.
[2:55:34.880 --> 2:55:39.320]  You're on the air from, I guess, old Britannic Majesty's headquarters.
[2:55:39.320 --> 2:55:40.320]  Go ahead.
[2:55:40.320 --> 2:55:41.320]  Yes.
[2:55:41.320 --> 2:55:42.320]  Hello.
[2:55:42.320 --> 2:55:43.320]  Thank you.
[2:55:43.320 --> 2:55:44.320]  Lord Alec.
[2:55:44.320 --> 2:55:45.320]  Let's talk to him.
[2:55:45.320 --> 2:55:46.320]  Yes.
[2:55:46.320 --> 2:55:52.560]  So radical Islam being the dominant group of Islam.
[2:55:52.560 --> 2:55:58.640]  Now that I've heard you say that a few times and it's completely false.
[2:55:58.640 --> 2:56:01.320]  I mean, they're the tiniest group of Islam.
[2:56:01.320 --> 2:56:05.000]  Well, I think the ones actually blowing stuff up and killing people are, but from a lot
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:10.600]  of experts I've seen, isn't the Wahhabist form dominating more and more Sunni Islam
[2:56:10.600 --> 2:56:13.240]  and Sunni Islam, 79% of Muslims.
[2:56:13.240 --> 2:56:19.800]  I mean, isn't there a new expansionist faction of Islam that, when I say the dominant, aren't
[2:56:19.800 --> 2:56:23.960]  they, aren't they the ones beginning to start to lead Islam?
[2:56:23.960 --> 2:56:31.280]  Well, they're trying to, but they've, you know, they're, they're like a tiny person
[2:56:31.280 --> 2:56:35.240]  percentage of a tiny percentage of a tiny percentage.
[2:56:35.240 --> 2:56:42.640]  I mean, Islamic cultures, Islamic communities, they're actually very resistant to that sort
[2:56:42.640 --> 2:56:48.400]  of radicalization because they're based around family structures.
[2:56:48.400 --> 2:56:56.400]  So, you know, a Muslim person would listen to their parents, their grandparents, maybe
[2:56:56.400 --> 2:56:58.920]  their local elders, and then it would be the Imam.
[2:56:58.920 --> 2:57:00.400]  So that's why you can't bring in-
[2:57:00.400 --> 2:57:01.400]  You know, I agree.
[2:57:01.400 --> 2:57:04.840]  That's one reason ISIS and Al Qaeda recruit a bunch of Western idiots who haven't ever
[2:57:04.840 --> 2:57:07.000]  been Muslims is because they're easier to recruit.
[2:57:07.000 --> 2:57:11.440]  What you're saying is true, but sir, Saudi Arabia is funding radical Islam.
[2:57:11.440 --> 2:57:16.840]  It controls the dominant Sunni system, you know, it's Sunni than Shiite.
[2:57:16.840 --> 2:57:22.960]  Shiite's about 19%, Alawite and other groups about 2%, Sunni Islam, what's 79% and the
[2:57:22.960 --> 2:57:27.320]  minority of that is Wahhabist, but that's what the royal family follows and they're
[2:57:27.320 --> 2:57:31.040]  trying to take over with that right now.
[2:57:31.040 --> 2:57:37.640]  Iran is sheer, Syria is sheer, most of North Africa is sheer, so you're right in saying
[2:57:37.640 --> 2:57:43.240]  that Saudis control the very radical element of Sunni.
[2:57:43.240 --> 2:57:44.240]  Yes.
[2:57:44.240 --> 2:57:45.400]  Listen, hey, I've studied history.
[2:57:45.400 --> 2:57:50.480]  For 200 years, Islam was a light in the world and the West was in barbarism, so Islam's
[2:57:50.480 --> 2:57:55.920]  in period has been a renaissance, but I mean, currently what I say with Saudi Arabia running
[2:57:55.920 --> 2:57:58.800]  in, I don't think so, but I'm not saying all Muslims.
[2:57:58.800 --> 2:58:01.360]  I don't hate Muslims because they're Muslims.
[2:58:01.360 --> 2:58:02.640]  I used to be a big apologist.
[2:58:02.640 --> 2:58:06.920]  I just am sick and tired of seeing this alliance with the left and the Wahhabist.
[2:58:06.920 --> 2:58:13.040]  Yes, you don't hate Muslims, the new world order hates Muslims and you used to know that,
[2:58:13.040 --> 2:58:19.640]  you used to say this on your show, they are a highly resistant group.
[2:58:19.640 --> 2:58:23.520]  Yes, and so they're using the Wahhabist that run around and murder all the Muslims that
[2:58:23.520 --> 2:58:28.680]  aren't going along with it in Egypt and in Libya and in Syria and countless areas, and
[2:58:28.680 --> 2:58:32.240]  I said that with Manning earlier, that they're going to use radical Islam as a way to play
[2:58:32.240 --> 2:58:35.840]  us off against each other in a class of civilizations and kill everybody.
[2:58:35.840 --> 2:58:40.520]  That said, though, all these radical Wahhabists merging with hip hop gangster culture are
[2:58:40.520 --> 2:58:44.960]  my enemies and then Muslims need to stand up against them and say no.
[2:58:44.960 --> 2:58:45.960]  That's all I'm saying.
[2:58:45.960 --> 2:58:46.960]  I appreciate it.
[2:58:46.960 --> 2:58:47.960]  God bless you, Tom.
[2:58:47.960 --> 2:58:55.080]  Yeah, first of all, I want to say, take the 12-actitude, super male, brain force, prostagart,
[2:58:55.080 --> 2:58:56.880]  silver bullet, I use them all.
[2:58:56.880 --> 2:58:57.880]  They're phenomenal.
[2:58:57.880 --> 2:58:58.880]  They work.
[2:58:58.880 --> 2:58:59.880]  Buy info.
[2:58:59.880 --> 2:59:00.880]  Thank you, brother.
[2:59:00.880 --> 2:59:01.880]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[2:59:01.880 --> 2:59:07.880]  I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[2:59:07.880 --> 2:59:09.880]  Welcome to the Info War.
[2:59:09.880 --> 2:59:14.600]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the Info War
[2:59:14.600 --> 2:59:15.600]  at the same time.
[2:59:15.600 --> 2:59:19.200]  I'm a nine-year listener, I buy all the nutraceuticals, Cascio FX, Nacin.org, I buy all the nutraceuticals,
[2:59:19.200 --> 2:59:20.200]  Cascio FX, Nacin.org.
[2:59:20.200 --> 2:59:21.200]  Why?
[2:59:21.200 --> 2:59:22.200]  God, let me ask you a question.
[2:59:22.200 --> 2:59:23.200]  Have they worked for you?
[2:59:23.200 --> 2:59:25.280]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[2:59:25.280 --> 2:59:26.280]  What products are you taking?
[2:59:26.280 --> 2:59:34.600]  Everything from super male to brain force to winter sun, X2, even got a little DNA force.
[2:59:34.600 --> 2:59:38.320]  So when I just re-upped everything and I just went to auto-fill.
[2:59:38.320 --> 2:59:43.360]  Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[2:59:43.360 --> 2:59:52.080]  Visit infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[2:59:52.080 --> 3:00:20.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:22.080 --> 3:00:27.080]  That's how dreams work, though, until the crystal cracked.
[3:00:27.080 --> 3:00:31.080]  I was a little kid, I wanted to be in voiceovers.
[3:00:31.080 --> 3:00:41.800]  And then, by the time I've been on radio, about five, six years, I was cutting commercials
[3:00:41.800 --> 3:00:50.720]  for national movie releases and for insurance companies and you name it, and it's crazy.
[3:00:50.720 --> 3:00:54.720]  I'm not bragging, it just shows the power of dreams.
[3:00:54.720 --> 3:01:00.080]  I could make more money and just be by myself, maybe with an agent, more money personally
[3:01:00.080 --> 3:01:05.040]  doing national voiceovers than I could as this major radio host, because I take a huge
[3:01:05.040 --> 3:01:10.720]  amount of money that comes in and put almost all of it back into the operation, so we reach
[3:01:10.720 --> 3:01:12.520]  more people.
[3:01:12.520 --> 3:01:13.520]  But you know what?
[3:01:13.520 --> 3:01:18.680]  There is no desire to even do voiceovers, because I could fly to New York and D.C. and
[3:01:18.680 --> 3:01:23.720]  L.A., but mainly L.A. in New York, but on these big jobs, they want you to audition
[3:01:23.720 --> 3:01:26.920]  and you're there with all these other actors and people, maybe 10, 15 of them, you go in
[3:01:26.920 --> 3:01:30.680]  for like 20, 30 minutes, then you go eat lunch, then they usually call you back, then it's
[3:01:30.680 --> 3:01:35.440]  two or three down to two or three, the director's listening of the movie, the TV show, the ad,
[3:01:35.440 --> 3:01:37.120]  then they say, okay, you got the job.
[3:01:37.120 --> 3:01:44.200]  The times I did that, I always got the job until they wanted me to do the voiceover for
[3:01:44.200 --> 3:01:48.080]  Jesse Ventura's TV show and I was busy, I didn't want to do it, and I didn't do a very
[3:01:48.080 --> 3:01:51.000]  good job and I didn't get that one.
[3:01:51.000 --> 3:01:52.000]  And that was Union Scale.
[3:01:52.000 --> 3:01:53.000]  I had a bunch of money doing that.
[3:01:53.000 --> 3:01:54.960]  I don't know why I'm telling a story about this.
[3:01:54.960 --> 3:02:01.240]  It just shows the power of dreams and the power of having an idea, liking to make fun
[3:02:01.240 --> 3:02:07.480]  of cartoon characters like Marvin the Martian, and then actually getting into RTF because
[3:02:07.480 --> 3:02:11.280]  of that, but being politically aware, being mad at the globalist, so deciding to just
[3:02:11.280 --> 3:02:14.720]  on the side fight the New World Order, because that's what I really wanted to do for no pay,
[3:02:14.720 --> 3:02:16.920]  and then that actually became my career.
[3:02:16.920 --> 3:02:21.400]  But I'm just pointing out what motivates me, not, oh my gosh, I just made all this money.
[3:02:21.400 --> 3:02:24.680]  It's like, oh my gosh, I've got to make a bunch of money to pay all this crew and these
[3:02:24.680 --> 3:02:29.200]  reporters and researchers to give the globalists a run for their money, so I can fly guested
[3:02:29.200 --> 3:02:33.360]  to be in studios so we can have investigative journalists all over the world doing really
[3:02:33.360 --> 3:02:34.440]  important work.
[3:02:34.440 --> 3:02:37.480]  It's amazing and I want to thank you all for your support and help.
[3:02:37.480 --> 3:02:40.160]  It's been incredible.
[3:02:40.160 --> 3:02:44.920]  And your dreams can come true as well, if it's done for the right reason.
[3:02:44.920 --> 3:02:48.680]  So many people I know get into fighting the New World Order for six months a year, they
[3:02:48.680 --> 3:02:53.860]  even have talent, other talk show hosts, people that were secular, not in politics, like
[3:02:53.860 --> 3:02:57.800]  Glenn Beck was a big liberal, and he said, oh I can do the Alex Jones shtick, well it's
[3:02:57.800 --> 3:03:04.360]  not a shtick, it's not about control and the movement, it's about defeating the globalist.
[3:03:04.360 --> 3:03:10.800]  And I'm just digressing, I don't even know why, I'm teleprompter free, so I start thinking
[3:03:10.800 --> 3:03:14.600]  about something and remembering something and then it just takes me down a rabbit trail,
[3:03:14.600 --> 3:03:22.480]  but so many people I've seen have gotten involved in media and politics because it's like somebody
[3:03:22.480 --> 3:03:25.680]  wasn't successful in acting, they want to be a weatherman or a weatherwoman or they
[3:03:25.680 --> 3:03:29.360]  want to be on the local news because they're a narcissist.
[3:03:29.360 --> 3:03:34.560]  With me it's the opposite, I could never be on TV, radio again and love it because I don't
[3:03:34.560 --> 3:03:40.360]  like being a public person, I don't do this because I want to be somebody.
[3:03:40.360 --> 3:03:44.200]  I do this because I take it personal, they're coming for my kids, they say my kids belong
[3:03:44.200 --> 3:03:48.440]  to the state, they want my guns, they want to overrun me with political correctness,
[3:03:48.440 --> 3:03:54.400]  they've got cults running at the schools saying the family is evil, this is ridiculous.
[3:03:54.400 --> 3:03:57.960]  And so many people I've seen in the Liberty Movement, not the grassroots, but others,
[3:03:57.960 --> 3:04:03.560]  they get involved and in a year they want to be the biggest swing and you know what,
[3:04:03.560 --> 3:04:05.120]  they want to be the big shot.
[3:04:05.120 --> 3:04:09.400]  So they start attacking other people in the movement and the rest of it to make themselves
[3:04:09.400 --> 3:04:13.480]  the kingpin and then claim that I've attacked them and it's so sad.
[3:04:13.480 --> 3:04:16.960]  But those aren't people that are meant to be leaders in this fight.
[3:04:16.960 --> 3:04:20.680]  You that have a pure heart, you that really want to fight tyranny, you've got to start
[3:04:20.680 --> 3:04:26.080]  a radio show or a TV show or a magazine or a YouTube channel or make a film or write
[3:04:26.080 --> 3:04:30.800]  a book or whatever, write a letter to the editor, just take that first step because
[3:04:30.800 --> 3:04:34.160]  you know you're in it for the right reasons and when you get attacked by trolls and stuff
[3:04:34.160 --> 3:04:38.360]  ignore the end fighting, they attempt that just to divert you off into distractions and
[3:04:38.360 --> 3:04:40.840]  move forward and that's how we're going to change the world.
[3:04:40.840 --> 3:04:45.200]  Speaking of fighting the operation, we got a big special that ends in just a few days
[3:04:45.200 --> 3:04:48.040]  on the Deep Cleanse Shiloh GZO light, you name it.
[3:04:48.040 --> 3:04:49.040]  No big deep cleanse, neither.
[3:04:49.040 --> 3:04:52.680]  You just put it in water, drink it every day, incredible with the stuff for me and my family
[3:04:52.680 --> 3:04:56.520]  and a bunch of other specials at m4slife.com and those purchases from this operation,
[3:04:56.520 --> 3:04:59.320]  thank you for your support.
[3:04:59.320 --> 3:05:03.920]  I predict that Gardasil will become the greatest medical scandal of all times because at some
[3:05:03.920 --> 3:05:08.400]  point in time, the evidence will add up to prove that this vaccine, technical and scientific
[3:05:08.400 --> 3:05:13.360]  feat that it may be, has absolutely no effect on cervical cancer and that all, the very
[3:05:13.360 --> 3:05:17.880]  many adverse effects which destroy lives and even kill, serve no other purpose other
[3:05:17.880 --> 3:05:20.520]  than to generate profit for the manufacturers.
[3:05:20.520 --> 3:05:25.280]  That was a statement made in April 2014 by a French medical doctor Bernard Delberg, he's
[3:05:25.280 --> 3:05:29.720]  a former pharmaceutical industry physician with Merck, the manufacturer of the HPV vaccine
[3:05:29.720 --> 3:05:30.720]  Gardasil.
[3:05:30.720 --> 3:05:34.840]  And now almost two years later, Dr. Singh Hang Lee, director of the Milford Molecular
[3:05:34.840 --> 3:05:38.400]  Diagnostics Laboratory in Connecticut, has proved these predictions correct.
[3:05:38.400 --> 3:05:42.040]  He published a letter sent to the US CDC, the World Health Organization and the Ministry
[3:05:42.040 --> 3:05:46.360]  of Health in Japan and others documenting scientific misconduct among the world's leading
[3:05:46.360 --> 3:05:50.560]  health organizations tasked with providing vaccine safety by deliberately misleading
[3:05:50.560 --> 3:05:53.760]  Japanese health authorities on the safety of the HPV vaccine.

[3:07:53.480 --> 3:08:03.440]  This is Uncle Sam with Music and the Truth Until Dawn.
[3:08:03.440 --> 3:08:07.400]  Right now, I got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[3:08:07.400 --> 3:08:11.400]  The chair is against the wall, John has a long mustache.
[3:08:11.400 --> 3:08:13.480]  This is the heart of 1776.
[3:08:13.480 --> 3:08:19.080]  It's 12 o'clock Americans, another day closer to victory and for all of you out there on
[3:08:19.080 --> 3:08:31.440]  a behind the lines, this is your song.
[3:08:31.440 --> 3:08:32.440]  Welcome back.
[3:08:32.440 --> 3:08:33.440]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[3:08:33.440 --> 3:08:34.440]  It's Thursday.
[3:08:34.440 --> 3:08:35.440]  This is the Alex Jones show Overdrive.
[3:08:35.440 --> 3:08:37.040]  We're going to have a lot of fun today.
[3:08:37.040 --> 3:08:41.400]  There's a lot of crazy news, truly, truly crazy news.
[3:08:41.400 --> 3:08:46.520]  And there's some good news as well, but mainly I've got some very interesting information
[3:08:46.520 --> 3:08:52.080]  about what the FBI is doing to spy on high school kids and how the FBI is warning that
[3:08:52.080 --> 3:08:54.680]  car hacking is real and what you can do about it.
[3:08:54.680 --> 3:08:57.640]  But beyond that, we're going to play a David Knight video that's really important first
[3:08:57.640 --> 3:08:59.000]  and we'll be right back with some more news.
[3:08:59.000 --> 3:09:00.000]  Here it is.
[3:09:00.000 --> 3:09:01.000]  DavidKnightFriendForWars.com.
[3:09:01.000 --> 3:09:07.320]  I'm here in Colonial Williamsburg and every time I spend or have to go to Washington,
[3:09:07.320 --> 3:09:12.720]  D.C. and witness this empire that has become everything that the founders of this country
[3:09:12.720 --> 3:09:15.440]  detested, I like to come by this place.
[3:09:15.440 --> 3:09:21.200]  It's a meticulous recreation of the American colonies right as the American Revolution
[3:09:21.200 --> 3:09:23.080]  was beginning.
[3:09:23.080 --> 3:09:27.440]  And it's nice to reattach to these founding principles, to the optimism, to the liberty
[3:09:27.440 --> 3:09:29.160]  that was there.
[3:09:29.160 --> 3:09:30.840]  Behind me is the House of Burgess.
[3:09:30.840 --> 3:09:35.480]  This is where the legislative body met for Virginia.
[3:09:35.480 --> 3:09:38.560]  And then this other direction over here is Shields Tavern.
[3:09:38.560 --> 3:09:40.440]  Shields Tavern was where we just ate lunch.
[3:09:40.440 --> 3:09:44.640]  And what they do is they have historical and actors, people in costume who will come by
[3:09:44.640 --> 3:09:45.640]  your table.
[3:09:45.640 --> 3:09:50.120]  They'll talk to the crowd in the room, give them some stories about what life was like
[3:09:50.120 --> 3:09:52.880]  at the time in character.
[3:09:52.880 --> 3:09:57.560]  This lady was saying that they would like to run up large bills because they didn't
[3:09:57.560 --> 3:10:00.720]  like to handle a lot of money.
[3:10:00.720 --> 3:10:03.240]  She said that they would take the dollars, they would cut them into pieces of eight.
[3:10:03.240 --> 3:10:04.720]  That's a whole other story I won't go into.
[3:10:04.720 --> 3:10:09.080]  But she told us about one particular customer, George Washington.
[3:10:09.080 --> 3:10:13.880]  She said he ran up a rather large bill of 21 days staying there, food and lodging.
[3:10:13.880 --> 3:10:17.480]  And he left that bill for over a year and a half, and that was not uncommon.
[3:10:17.480 --> 3:10:22.760]  But he came by here and settled his bill in 1775 as he was on his way to the Continental
[3:10:22.760 --> 3:10:24.000]  Congress.
[3:10:24.000 --> 3:10:25.760]  Concord and Lexington had just happened.
[3:10:25.760 --> 3:10:26.880]  He knew there was going to be a war.
[3:10:26.880 --> 3:10:30.280]  He thought he might die, so he wanted to settle his accounts.
[3:10:30.280 --> 3:10:34.200]  She also talked about how when he went to the Continental Congress, he met with John
[3:10:34.200 --> 3:10:35.200]  Adams.
[3:10:35.200 --> 3:10:41.200]  And John Adams, a man who doesn't like anyone, did not like anyone, took a great deal of
[3:10:41.200 --> 3:10:45.480]  liking to George Washington, thought he was very intelligent, an honest man, said he was
[3:10:45.480 --> 3:10:49.320]  going to nominate him to be the commanding general of the Continental Army.
[3:10:49.320 --> 3:10:50.320]  And he did that the next day.
[3:10:50.320 --> 3:10:52.960]  And George Washington showed up in uniform.
[3:10:52.960 --> 3:10:57.920]  He was nominated, and showing up in uniform was not to impress people, but it was to quietly
[3:10:57.920 --> 3:11:02.640]  convey that he was available for the office.
[3:11:02.640 --> 3:11:04.820]  Very understated way to do this.
[3:11:04.820 --> 3:11:07.440]  As they nominated him and proceeded to vote, he left.
[3:11:07.440 --> 3:11:15.720]  Now, I want to contrast that with Ted Cruz, a man who epitomizes ruthless ambition without
[3:11:15.720 --> 3:11:19.280]  principles, dishonest and desperate.
[3:11:19.280 --> 3:11:25.040]  We've seen Ted Cruz, just over the last couple of weeks, throw Donald Trump and his supporters
[3:11:25.040 --> 3:11:30.280]  under the bus saying they were to blame because they didn't use the gentle language of political
[3:11:30.280 --> 3:11:31.920]  correctness.
[3:11:31.920 --> 3:11:37.240]  Saying that they were to blame for the people who infiltrated their rallies, who aggressively
[3:11:37.240 --> 3:11:42.000]  confronted people, and then went out in the parking lot and stopped ambulances, attacked
[3:11:42.000 --> 3:11:46.880]  cars that had bumper stickers that they didn't like, damaging those cars.
[3:11:46.880 --> 3:11:49.640]  Today we see something even more amazing.
[3:11:49.640 --> 3:11:53.040]  And I want to read you this quote from Ted Cruz.
[3:11:53.040 --> 3:11:56.560]  This is what he said in response to the shootings in Brussels.
[3:11:56.560 --> 3:12:01.800]  He said, well, I will say it's striking that the day after Donald Trump called for America
[3:12:01.800 --> 3:12:07.120]  weakening NATO with drawing from NATO, we see Brussels, where NATO is headquartered,
[3:12:07.120 --> 3:12:10.480]  the subject of a radical Islamist terror attack.
[3:12:10.480 --> 3:12:14.920]  So Donald Trump is wrong that America should withdraw from the world and abandon our allies.
[3:12:14.920 --> 3:12:19.640]  Donald Trump is wrong that America should retreat from Europe.
[3:12:19.640 --> 3:12:25.720]  Now I want to ask you, what would the founders of our country say to a man like Ted Cruz,
[3:12:25.720 --> 3:12:31.640]  a man who puts his own personal ambition ahead of the eligibility requirements in the Constitution?
[3:12:31.640 --> 3:12:36.000]  Who says that we need to be at a state of perpetual war?
[3:12:36.000 --> 3:12:41.520]  And who takes every opportunity to throw his political opponents under the bus in the most
[3:12:41.520 --> 3:12:43.200]  dishonest ways?
[3:12:43.200 --> 3:12:44.200]  That is Ted Cruz.
[3:12:44.200 --> 3:12:49.320]  It's not enough for him to go to APAC yesterday and be the most groveling of all the candidates.
[3:12:49.320 --> 3:12:53.600]  I thought it was disgusting that we have to have our presidential candidates parade before
[3:12:53.600 --> 3:12:58.320]  people who put the foreign interests of another country ahead of America.
[3:12:58.320 --> 3:13:01.200]  We should never put Israel's interests ahead of America.
[3:13:01.200 --> 3:13:03.960]  No other country should be put ahead of America.
[3:13:03.960 --> 3:13:06.000]  We need America first.
[3:13:06.000 --> 3:13:07.640]  This is America.
[3:13:07.640 --> 3:13:09.700]  And this is what we're having an election here.
[3:13:09.700 --> 3:13:14.640]  We should not put the interests of Mexico or Israel or France or Belgium, anyone ahead
[3:13:14.640 --> 3:13:17.120]  of Americans' interest.
[3:13:17.120 --> 3:13:19.360]  But that's what they did for Israel yesterday.
[3:13:19.360 --> 3:13:24.680]  And of all the sycophants there, the worst one was Ted Cruz.
[3:13:24.680 --> 3:13:27.280]  Donald Trump is even saying we need to pull back from NATO.
[3:13:27.280 --> 3:13:30.200]  We need to distance ourselves from the United Nations control.
[3:13:30.200 --> 3:13:33.600]  And, you know, it's not in your interest, Israel, to have the United Nations controlling
[3:13:33.600 --> 3:13:34.600]  your country either.
[3:13:34.600 --> 3:13:37.760]  He's pulling back from the globalism to some degree.
[3:13:37.760 --> 3:13:42.680]  I would like to see a complete repudiation of the American Empire.
[3:13:42.680 --> 3:13:47.000]  And we were warned by our founders that it would become despotic at home, that it would
[3:13:47.000 --> 3:13:49.680]  become the very thing that we were fighting abroad.
[3:13:49.680 --> 3:13:53.200]  It was John Adams who said, we don't go abroad seeking monsters to destroy.
[3:13:53.200 --> 3:13:54.200]  Now we do.
[3:13:54.200 --> 3:13:55.200]  Now we do.
[3:13:55.200 --> 3:14:00.120]  And if we don't have those monsters, we create those monsters and we keep ourselves perpetually
[3:14:00.120 --> 3:14:05.920]  tied together in these foreign entanglements that George Washington warned us about.
[3:14:05.920 --> 3:14:08.920]  For FLWARS.com, at Colonial Williamsburg, I'm David Knight.
[3:14:08.920 --> 3:14:11.560]  Well, there's a few thoughts from David Knight.
[3:14:11.560 --> 3:14:15.360]  You know, what's interesting to me is that when something horrible happens, like what
[3:14:15.360 --> 3:14:20.800]  happened in Brussels with the terrorist attacks, a truly tragic event, the news focus changes
[3:14:20.800 --> 3:14:21.800]  completely.
[3:14:21.800 --> 3:14:22.800]  And for good reason, right?
[3:14:22.800 --> 3:14:23.800]  Why wouldn't we want to discuss these things?
[3:14:23.800 --> 3:14:24.800]  We have to.
[3:14:24.800 --> 3:14:26.120]  It's the biggest event out there.
[3:14:26.120 --> 3:14:31.280]  But what also happens is, it's kind of like a magnifying glass and there's a huge, huge
[3:14:31.280 --> 3:14:32.280]  map, right?
[3:14:32.280 --> 3:14:34.280]  And we're just looking at one thing.
[3:14:34.280 --> 3:14:37.880]  And again, obviously we have to talk about these things as the biggest thing out there.
[3:14:37.880 --> 3:14:43.560]  But what I've got in front of me is news that no one's paying attention to because of all
[3:14:43.560 --> 3:14:46.600]  of the mania and the craziness behind Brussels.
[3:14:46.600 --> 3:14:47.600]  And again, it is craziness.
[3:14:47.600 --> 3:14:48.600]  It is mania.
[3:14:48.600 --> 3:14:49.600]  There's stuff to talk about, right?
[3:14:49.600 --> 3:14:50.600]  It is big, huge news.
[3:14:50.600 --> 3:14:51.600]  We should be discussing it.
[3:14:51.600 --> 3:14:56.040]  But at the same time, I've got a pretty big stack here that I haven't seen anyone else
[3:14:56.040 --> 3:14:57.440]  talk about.
[3:14:57.440 --> 3:15:00.400]  And what I wanted to do is we'll cover some Brussels stuff for sure.
[3:15:00.400 --> 3:15:02.880]  And we're going to take some calls also, by the way.
[3:15:02.880 --> 3:15:06.520]  And the caller's on the line, I don't want to drop you.
[3:15:06.520 --> 3:15:10.520]  I don't want to drop you, but I want you to be on topic of what we're talking about now.
[3:15:10.520 --> 3:15:13.240]  So let's do that because I don't want to drop you.
[3:15:13.240 --> 3:15:14.240]  I know you've been waiting.
[3:15:14.240 --> 3:15:17.120]  So I don't want to be disrespectful in that way, but we have to be on topic now.
[3:15:17.120 --> 3:15:18.720]  And I will answer your questions.
[3:15:18.720 --> 3:15:20.960]  I'm also taking some questions on Twitter.
[3:15:20.960 --> 3:15:22.920]  I'm going to read those live on air.
[3:15:22.920 --> 3:15:26.800]  So if you tweet me at AS, Gucci Yarding, I'm going to read some questions on air so everyone
[3:15:26.800 --> 3:15:29.040]  can get their questions in.
[3:15:29.040 --> 3:15:33.160]  But look, again, the Brussels thing is huge, but there's so much going on in these stacks
[3:15:33.160 --> 3:15:34.720]  that we need to talk about.
[3:15:34.720 --> 3:15:39.120]  One thing that people also seem to miss back earlier in March, and then we're going to
[3:15:39.120 --> 3:15:44.880]  get some more breaking news, is what the FBI is doing with a new plan to spy on children
[3:15:44.880 --> 3:15:45.880]  in the classroom.
[3:15:45.880 --> 3:15:50.520]  So not even just spy on adults, children whose brains are developing and they have no idea
[3:15:50.520 --> 3:15:51.800]  what's even going on.
[3:15:51.800 --> 3:15:56.120]  They're using new surveillance program to urge teachers to report students critical of government
[3:15:56.120 --> 3:15:58.480]  policies and Western corruption.
[3:15:58.480 --> 3:15:59.560]  This is from Alternet.
[3:15:59.560 --> 3:16:03.280]  This story is absurd.
[3:16:03.280 --> 3:16:06.880]  This is one of those stories too where you can share with somebody and send it to them
[3:16:06.880 --> 3:16:08.960]  when they say, everything's great.
[3:16:08.960 --> 3:16:12.440]  The people that run the country just love you and you're crazy and you're a conspiracy
[3:16:12.440 --> 3:16:13.440]  theorist.
[3:16:13.440 --> 3:16:17.200]  If you question anything about the establishment, this is a great story to send.
[3:16:17.200 --> 3:16:21.080]  So under new guidelines, the FBI is instructing high school students across the country to
[3:16:21.080 --> 3:16:23.880]  report students who do what?
[3:16:23.880 --> 3:16:29.000]  Criticize government policies and quote Western corruption as, what are they going to report
[3:16:29.000 --> 3:16:30.000]  them as?
[3:16:30.000 --> 3:16:34.560]  Potential future terrorists warning that anarchist extremists are in the same category
[3:16:34.560 --> 3:16:40.440]  as ISIS and young people who are poor immigrants or travel to suspicious countries are more
[3:16:40.440 --> 3:16:42.480]  likely to commit horrific violence.
[3:16:42.480 --> 3:16:44.840]  So let me tell you something.
[3:16:44.840 --> 3:16:49.600]  People that like to align with the political leaders that are part of the very, very deeply
[3:16:49.600 --> 3:16:53.280]  entrenched establishment system and think they get power from doing so and think they
[3:16:53.280 --> 3:16:58.640]  get power from debating on behalf of the truly corrupt, quote, unquote, Western corruption
[3:16:58.640 --> 3:16:59.640]  that I'm discussing.
[3:16:59.640 --> 3:17:02.720]  I'm now a terrorist under these guidelines.
[3:17:02.720 --> 3:17:07.880]  Those are the people that will read something like this and their illusion, their facade
[3:17:07.880 --> 3:17:11.920]  will just be shattered like glass, like bullet to glass.
[3:17:11.920 --> 3:17:14.760]  And they will just say, wait a minute, what?
[3:17:14.760 --> 3:17:22.400]  Because it's politically correct, it's politically correct to protect the very people that they're
[3:17:22.400 --> 3:17:25.080]  now saying are terrorists, very, very strange, right?
[3:17:25.080 --> 3:17:30.560]  So it says, again, young people who are poor immigrants and travel to suspicious countries
[3:17:30.560 --> 3:17:32.480]  are more likely to commit horrific violence.
[3:17:32.480 --> 3:17:35.040]  They are more likely, I guess, to be classified as a terrorist.
[3:17:35.040 --> 3:17:36.040]  This is from Alternet.
[3:17:36.040 --> 3:17:40.860]  This isn't something I'm making up from a blog or something that I read on Twitter.
[3:17:40.860 --> 3:17:46.440]  This is from a new source that uses citations and it's on Salon, too.
[3:17:46.440 --> 3:17:50.000]  So it's not a so-called any type of right-wing conspiracy or whatever.
[3:17:50.000 --> 3:17:51.000]  It's on Salon as well.
[3:17:51.000 --> 3:17:53.320]  FBI has planned to spy on high school kids.
[3:17:53.320 --> 3:17:57.600]  So it just brings you back to the reality that maybe the people that are deeply entrenched
[3:17:57.600 --> 3:18:00.240]  in the establishment that are corrupt aren't on your side.
[3:18:00.240 --> 3:18:05.080]  Wait a minute, maybe it's the grassroots opposition and independent thinkers and people that actually
[3:18:05.080 --> 3:18:08.520]  care about you and humanity in the future that are on your side.
[3:18:08.520 --> 3:18:10.520]  Could that be possible?
[3:18:10.520 --> 3:18:11.840]  Consider for one moment, right?
[3:18:11.840 --> 3:18:14.400]  Consider for one moment that I actually care about you.
[3:18:14.400 --> 3:18:19.680]  Consider for one moment that I actually care about the future of not only this country
[3:18:19.680 --> 3:18:22.000]  but this planet and intellectual thought.
[3:18:22.000 --> 3:18:26.560]  Consider for a moment that independent media actually cares as opposed to the establishment
[3:18:26.560 --> 3:18:29.200]  that you try to draw power from, some of you.
[3:18:29.200 --> 3:18:31.000]  Very, very sad but very, very eye-opening.
[3:18:31.000 --> 3:18:34.720]  And at the same time, you know, I was sitting in my car earlier today and has one of those
[3:18:34.720 --> 3:18:38.400]  fobs where you can unlock it and lock it and trigger the alarm or whatever.
[3:18:38.400 --> 3:18:46.480]  And I was thinking, gosh, people keep acting like that their car is so safe and secure.
[3:18:46.480 --> 3:18:51.800]  We've got people that are hacking into NSA databases, all right?
[3:18:51.800 --> 3:18:56.400]  Like 14-year-olds that are like DDoSing websites and hacking into government establishment
[3:18:56.400 --> 3:19:02.520]  databases that use super high quality, amazing firewalls and everything like that.
[3:19:02.520 --> 3:19:03.880]  They're just breaking into it.
[3:19:03.880 --> 3:19:07.440]  Why are we thinking that people aren't soon going to develop easy systems to get into
[3:19:07.440 --> 3:19:08.440]  our cars?
[3:19:08.440 --> 3:19:09.960]  I mean, they set them up just like that.
[3:19:09.960 --> 3:19:15.120]  They set them up, obviously, so they can, you know, the car manufacturers or law enforcement
[3:19:15.120 --> 3:19:16.440]  wherever can get into them.
[3:19:16.440 --> 3:19:18.440]  Well, guess who else can also get into them?
[3:19:18.440 --> 3:19:21.560]  People that are going to develop these technologies, it's already been done with a number of different
[3:19:21.560 --> 3:19:22.560]  brands I saw.
[3:19:22.560 --> 3:19:25.320]  They said, yeah, well, you know, the way it works.
[3:19:25.320 --> 3:19:28.920]  And the so-called white hat hackers, which are actually amazing, awesome people that
[3:19:28.920 --> 3:19:32.880]  I very much respect, they figure out how to get into these things in the interest of
[3:19:32.880 --> 3:19:33.880]  public safety.
[3:19:33.880 --> 3:19:36.320]  And they're learning more and more how they're getting into these cars.
[3:19:36.320 --> 3:19:39.680]  So when we get back here in a moment, we're going to talk about how people can actually
[3:19:39.680 --> 3:19:43.640]  hack into your vehicle and some stuff that you can maybe do to prevent it and where that's
[3:19:43.640 --> 3:19:44.640]  all heading.
[3:19:44.640 --> 3:19:46.960]  Some very interesting stuff and a lot more news coming right back.
[3:19:46.960 --> 3:19:59.680]  Anthony Guccardi, this is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[3:19:59.680 --> 3:20:21.080]  No God, that's what I said.

[3:20:59.640 --> 3:21:05.800]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits
[3:21:05.800 --> 3:21:06.800]  of silver.

[3:22:25.840 --> 3:22:28.800]  From the Robert Allen system, current return is not indicative of future results.
[3:22:28.800 --> 3:22:31.960]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[3:22:31.960 --> 3:22:35.160]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River.
[3:22:35.160 --> 3:22:36.160]  I loved my dad.
[3:22:36.160 --> 3:22:37.480]  But boy was he stubborn.
[3:22:37.480 --> 3:22:40.440]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[3:22:40.440 --> 3:22:41.440]  His excuse?
[3:22:41.440 --> 3:22:42.640]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[3:22:42.640 --> 3:22:44.240]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.

[3:22:49.040 --> 3:22:50.040]  for my father.

[3:22:55.840 --> 3:22:56.840]  ones.

[3:22:57.840 --> 3:22:58.840]  Hey, everyone.
[3:22:58.840 --> 3:23:02.680]  With 20-plus years as a radio host, I've seen about everything.
[3:23:02.680 --> 3:23:08.120]  One thing that keeps recurring, though, are these timeshare charlatans, these high-pressure
[3:23:08.120 --> 3:23:13.440]  salespeople who get folks to come out to some resort for a special weekend offer, then they
[3:23:13.440 --> 3:23:17.440]  get them in a corner and browbeat them and coerce them into buying a timeshare they don't
[3:23:17.440 --> 3:23:19.440]  need, they don't want, and they can't afford.
[3:23:19.440 --> 3:23:23.000]  And then they're stuck with that thing forever, monthly payments, mortgage payments, annual
[3:23:23.000 --> 3:23:24.720]  fees that keep going up and up.
[3:23:24.720 --> 3:23:27.920]  Well, up until recently, people thought they couldn't get rid of these things.
[3:23:27.920 --> 3:23:31.360]  You know, you can't get out of the contract, you can't get out of the deed or the membership.
[3:23:31.360 --> 3:23:32.680]  Well, that's not true.
[3:23:32.680 --> 3:23:38.400]  My friends at American Consumer Credit, a timeshare release company, can get you free.
[3:23:38.400 --> 3:23:40.080]  That's their personal guarantee.
[3:23:40.080 --> 3:23:45.600]  12 years in business, free consultation, A-plus rating with the BBB, they're the real deal.
[3:23:45.600 --> 3:23:47.640]  You want to get out of your timeshare contract?
[3:23:47.640 --> 3:23:48.640]  Call them now.
[3:23:48.640 --> 3:23:49.640]  That's 805-87-EXIT.
[3:23:49.640 --> 3:23:50.640]  That's 805-87-3948.
[3:23:50.640 --> 3:23:51.640]  805-87-EXIT.
[3:23:51.640 --> 3:23:52.640]  Call now.
[3:23:52.640 --> 3:23:53.640]  805-87-3948.
[3:23:53.640 --> 3:23:54.640]  All right, we're back.
[3:23:54.640 --> 3:24:07.760]  We're going to talk a little bit more about this car hacking stuff.
[3:24:07.760 --> 3:24:08.760]  It's very, very interesting.
[3:24:08.760 --> 3:24:13.800]  We're going to talk about how hackers could get into your vehicle and how the FBI and
[3:24:13.800 --> 3:24:18.640]  the government are saying, watch out for the hackers.
[3:24:18.640 --> 3:24:22.320]  And it's funny to me because the manufacturers and the law enforcement agencies of course
[3:24:22.320 --> 3:24:26.920]  worked to build in all the smart technologies that now they're warning you against and saying
[3:24:26.920 --> 3:24:27.920]  you could be hacked at any time.
[3:24:27.920 --> 3:24:30.680]  So we're going to talk about that in a minute, maybe what you can do about it.
[3:24:30.680 --> 3:24:34.200]  But first, what I want to do is I want to continue to take some more calls.
[3:24:34.200 --> 3:24:37.160]  We have some people patiently waiting, but we're going to open up those phone lines.
[3:24:37.160 --> 3:24:39.720]  And here's what I want to talk about.
[3:24:39.720 --> 3:24:42.320]  So there's an article that came out this month.
[3:24:42.320 --> 3:24:46.200]  For 80 years, young Americans have been getting more anxious and depressed, and no one is
[3:24:46.200 --> 3:24:48.200]  quite sure why.
[3:24:48.200 --> 3:24:52.800]  And that ties also in with an article about how depression isn't more than just a mental
[3:24:52.800 --> 3:24:53.800]  disorder.
[3:24:53.800 --> 3:24:54.800]  It affects the whole organism.
[3:24:54.800 --> 3:24:56.120]  Basically, it's killing you if you're depressed.
[3:24:56.120 --> 3:24:59.200]  And they say they don't know why people are so depressed and upset and their dreams have
[3:24:59.200 --> 3:25:01.800]  been crushed for the last 80 years.
[3:25:01.800 --> 3:25:03.160]  We don't know what's going on.
[3:25:03.160 --> 3:25:08.000]  Well, I have a theory and a few thoughts on that that I think 100% answer the question.
[3:25:08.000 --> 3:25:10.600]  So I'm going to get to that as well and tell you my thoughts on it.
[3:25:10.600 --> 3:25:12.080]  But I want to know what you think.
[3:25:12.080 --> 3:25:13.760]  Why do you think people are so upset?
[3:25:13.760 --> 3:25:15.080]  Why do you think they're so depressed?
[3:25:15.080 --> 3:25:17.200]  Why do you feel like they're so defeated?
[3:25:17.200 --> 3:25:22.480]  Why did they wake up in the morning and think it's Monday, I hate my life, I can't last
[3:25:22.480 --> 3:25:27.000]  another week, I cannot wait till it's Friday, God, I just want to get out of this, the society
[3:25:27.000 --> 3:25:28.000]  is terrible.
[3:25:28.000 --> 3:25:30.320]  Why are people so frustrated?
[3:25:30.320 --> 3:25:35.440]  Could it be because they're led into a false hope and a false dream?
[3:25:35.440 --> 3:25:42.160]  Could it be that they are treated in an establishment meat grinder where their hopes and dreams
[3:25:42.160 --> 3:25:47.400]  go to die, where they're worked until they're a ripe old age of retirement and they're told
[3:25:47.400 --> 3:25:51.120]  that they must think and act a certain way and they're not allowed to do anything that
[3:25:51.120 --> 3:25:52.600]  is out of the ordinary?
[3:25:52.600 --> 3:25:54.400]  I think that might be it and we'll get into that too.
[3:25:54.400 --> 3:25:56.120]  So give me a call.
[3:25:56.120 --> 3:26:00.200]  We've got a few open, we've got some people still waiting, I believe, but why are people
[3:26:00.200 --> 3:26:01.200]  so upset right now?
[3:26:01.200 --> 3:26:02.280]  Your thoughts on that?
[3:26:02.280 --> 3:26:06.480]  So call in, but back to this car hacking for a moment.
[3:26:06.480 --> 3:26:07.480]  For a moment.
[3:26:07.480 --> 3:26:11.320]  It's been eight months since a pair of security researchers proved beyond any doubt that car
[3:26:11.320 --> 3:26:16.080]  hacking is more than an action movie plot device when they remotely killed the transmission
[3:26:16.080 --> 3:26:21.040]  of a 2014 Jeep Cherokee as it drove down St. Louis, as I drove down St. Louis Highway,
[3:26:21.040 --> 3:26:23.360]  this is written in first person in an article.
[3:26:23.360 --> 3:26:27.000]  Now the FBI has caught up with the news and it's warning Americans to take the risk of
[3:26:27.000 --> 3:26:29.480]  vehicular cyber-sabotage seriously.
[3:26:29.480 --> 3:26:31.600]  Yeah, of course.
[3:26:31.600 --> 3:26:35.520]  Like I said, they hack Chinese government systems.
[3:26:35.520 --> 3:26:42.160]  By the way, the call-in number is 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231, the call on those issues
[3:26:42.160 --> 3:26:43.560]  I just talked about.
[3:26:43.560 --> 3:26:49.680]  So now the FBI is giving out a public service announcement saying the Department of Transportation
[3:26:49.680 --> 3:26:54.760]  and National Highway Traffic and all those blah, blah, blah, is saying watch out for
[3:26:54.760 --> 3:26:57.320]  over-the-internet attacks on cars and trucks.
[3:26:57.320 --> 3:27:00.200]  The announcement doesn't reveal any sign the agencies have learned about incidents
[3:27:00.200 --> 3:27:01.880]  of car hacking that weren't already public.
[3:27:01.880 --> 3:27:04.600]  Yeah, I'm sure that's never happened before.
[3:27:04.600 --> 3:27:06.600]  Definitely not.
[3:27:06.600 --> 3:27:10.560]  Quote, modern motor vehicles often include new connected vehicle technologies that aim
[3:27:10.560 --> 3:27:15.480]  to provide benefits such as added safety features, improve fuel economy, and greater overall convenience.
[3:27:15.480 --> 3:27:20.120]  The public service announcement reads, aftermarket devices are also providing consumers with new
[3:27:20.120 --> 3:27:22.780]  features to monitor the status of their vehicles.
[3:27:22.780 --> 3:27:26.040]  This increased connectivity is important to consumers and manufacturers, maintain awareness
[3:27:26.040 --> 3:27:27.840]  of potential cybersecurity threats.
[3:27:27.840 --> 3:27:29.840]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:27:29.840 --> 3:27:34.120]  And the problem is you can't push that kind of stuff and say how great it is for law enforcement
[3:27:34.120 --> 3:27:37.440]  and for the manufacturers and stuff and say, well, it's actually kind of bad.
[3:27:37.440 --> 3:27:38.840]  You should really watch out.
[3:27:38.840 --> 3:27:43.440]  Thankfully, we have white hat hackers who go in and hack it and try to give the information
[3:27:43.440 --> 3:27:44.440]  out.
[3:27:44.440 --> 3:27:47.320]  Jeep had to send everybody flash drives and do a recall of their vehicle because you
[3:27:47.320 --> 3:27:48.680]  could turn it off.
[3:27:48.680 --> 3:27:49.840]  And there's other ones that it mentions.
[3:27:49.840 --> 3:27:51.320]  You can turn the brakes off.
[3:27:51.320 --> 3:27:53.000]  It is crazy stuff.
[3:27:53.000 --> 3:27:57.520]  And one time I broke down on the side of the road and I pressed a little connected drive
[3:27:57.520 --> 3:27:58.520]  thing on my car.
[3:27:58.520 --> 3:28:00.280]  I had never used it before.
[3:28:00.280 --> 3:28:05.360]  It just kind of beep sometimes and makes me wonder if it, you know, what it's doing.
[3:28:05.360 --> 3:28:09.280]  And so I pressed it and I thought I would have to explain, well, you know, I'm on such
[3:28:09.280 --> 3:28:10.280]  and such road.
[3:28:10.280 --> 3:28:11.280]  They're like, no, we have your exact GPS location.
[3:28:11.280 --> 3:28:13.560]  We'll be sending out an officer right away.
[3:28:13.560 --> 3:28:16.400]  And your nearest, you know, dealership is such and such.
[3:28:16.400 --> 3:28:19.760]  And the ETA is an hour and 10 minutes or whatever it is.
[3:28:19.760 --> 3:28:21.400]  And you need anything else.
[3:28:21.400 --> 3:28:24.520]  And we could even take some of the diagnostics from your vehicle.
[3:28:24.520 --> 3:28:28.200]  Pretty crazy stuff to think, well, gee, maybe.
[3:28:28.200 --> 3:28:30.920]  Maybe someone could take advantage of that information.
[3:28:30.920 --> 3:28:35.320]  Maybe someone could take advantage of the GPS locations every single place you've gone.
[3:28:35.320 --> 3:28:40.160]  Maybe that metadata is really valuable to certain agencies or corporations.
[3:28:40.160 --> 3:28:42.840]  It's almost like kind of like how Facebook sells metadata.
[3:28:42.840 --> 3:28:44.440]  That's really crazy.
[3:28:44.440 --> 3:28:46.960]  And it's obviously not just the metadata, right?
[3:28:46.960 --> 3:28:49.120]  So we're going to get in some more news before we come back.
[3:28:49.120 --> 3:28:53.960]  And I've got a very special video for you to play, play that Alex wants you to see.
[3:28:53.960 --> 3:28:55.400]  So we're going to play that when we come back as well.
[3:28:55.400 --> 3:28:58.240]  First, let's get into a little bit more news and then we're going to take your calls.
[3:28:58.240 --> 3:29:01.560]  This is a super loaded show, lots of stuff out there.
[3:29:01.560 --> 3:29:04.480]  One thing we've talked about before are super flares.
[3:29:04.480 --> 3:29:08.200]  And everyone seems to kind of talk about for a little bit and the scientists freak out
[3:29:08.200 --> 3:29:10.320]  and say there's a super flare that could happen.
[3:29:10.320 --> 3:29:11.320]  And no one cares.
[3:29:11.320 --> 3:29:13.680]  And I'm going to put this into perspective for you.
[3:29:13.680 --> 3:29:15.280]  What is a super flare?
[3:29:15.280 --> 3:29:18.080]  Researchers explain devastating consequences of an eruption from the sun.
[3:29:18.080 --> 3:29:20.080]  I'm going to tell you why I'm talking about this.
[3:29:20.080 --> 3:29:21.080]  Very important.
[3:29:21.080 --> 3:29:25.960]  So a super flare, if it one erupted from the sun, it'll have a devastating effect on earth.
[3:29:25.960 --> 3:29:27.840]  And it goes on to talk about radio communication.
[3:29:27.840 --> 3:29:30.040]  A lot of stuff will be taken down.
[3:29:30.040 --> 3:29:31.640]  And they say one could be coming, right?
[3:29:31.640 --> 3:29:36.880]  I'm going to tell you why that's important and what we could actually do to, you know,
[3:29:36.880 --> 3:29:39.280]  why basically wrap our minds around the craziness.
[3:29:39.280 --> 3:29:40.280]  We'll be right back.
[3:29:40.280 --> 3:29:48.760]  And I've got a video coming up as well.
[3:29:48.760 --> 3:30:05.440]  The left-leaning women from the popular daytime TV show, The View, are finally starting to
[3:30:05.440 --> 3:30:12.640]  admit that they agree with Donald Trump on his foreign policy and views on ISIS.
[3:30:12.640 --> 3:30:15.080]  I thought Donald Trump sounded really reasonable today.
[3:30:15.080 --> 3:30:17.120]  My law enforcement background kicked in.
[3:30:17.120 --> 3:30:18.720]  This isn't crazy.
[3:30:18.720 --> 3:30:20.840]  We need to be forceful.
[3:30:20.840 --> 3:30:24.240]  We can't have these muted responses to terror.
[3:30:24.240 --> 3:30:26.440]  And let me also say this about Donald Trump.
[3:30:26.440 --> 3:30:28.920]  We trash him often here.
[3:30:28.920 --> 3:30:34.680]  Bottom line is in January, and you've been saying that, Raven, in January of this year,
[3:30:34.680 --> 3:30:36.840]  he said Brussels was a hellhole.
[3:30:36.840 --> 3:30:41.000]  He said there is something going on, Maria, and it is not good talking about Belgium.
[3:30:41.000 --> 3:30:42.000]  He was right.
[3:30:42.000 --> 3:30:43.000]  So he's right on a couple of things.
[3:30:43.000 --> 3:30:45.480]  So his foreign policy isn't so outrageous.
[3:30:45.480 --> 3:30:48.200]  So is Donald Trump really the voice of reason?
[3:30:48.200 --> 3:30:53.360]  And which candidate makes you feel safer, Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton?
[3:30:53.360 --> 3:30:57.960]  Let us know what you think in the comment section right now at Infowars.com.
[3:30:57.960 --> 3:31:05.200]  In the first decade of my battle against the globalist, I gained close to 100 pounds.
[3:31:05.200 --> 3:31:09.880]  Now in the last four years, with help from the products at InfowarsLife.com, I have lost
[3:31:09.880 --> 3:31:12.680]  80 plus pounds of that weight.
[3:31:12.680 --> 3:31:17.400]  And as many viewers have noted, the weight loss has accelerated in the last year.
[3:31:17.400 --> 3:31:21.320]  The big turning point was when I did my first liver cleanse.
[3:31:21.320 --> 3:31:25.600]  My friends, I have gotten a lot of dramatic results with the incredible products at InfowarsLife.com.
[3:31:25.600 --> 3:31:31.320]  But the most dramatic hands down, and the reviewers agree with me, is the ultimate cleanse pack
[3:31:31.320 --> 3:31:32.720]  and the results you will see.
[3:31:32.720 --> 3:31:37.200]  We're giving you 20% off the ultimate cleanse pack with liver shield, oxy powder, and deep
[3:31:37.200 --> 3:31:41.400]  cleanse all combined with a huge 20% discount at InfowarsLife.com.
[3:31:41.400 --> 3:31:45.000]  A lot of my family and a lot of the office are now doing the cleanse with me.
[3:31:45.000 --> 3:31:49.920]  And so I'm challenging you, the fellow Infowars, to take action with me and do the cleanse
[3:31:49.920 --> 3:31:50.920]  as well.
[3:31:50.920 --> 3:31:54.960]  Just go to InfowarsLife.com for yourself, go to the liver cleanse, deep cleanse page,
[3:31:54.960 --> 3:31:56.440]  and see the facts.
[3:31:56.440 --> 3:31:58.800]  It is game changing.
[3:31:58.800 --> 3:32:02.000]  Hey everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side.
[3:32:02.000 --> 3:32:05.880]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[3:32:05.880 --> 3:32:09.520]  You've all heard the shocking statistics, despite spending trillions of dollars in health
[3:32:09.520 --> 3:32:13.640]  care nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country.
[3:32:13.640 --> 3:32:18.240]  Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[3:32:18.240 --> 3:32:21.480]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone
[3:32:21.480 --> 3:32:24.080]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[3:32:24.080 --> 3:32:27.320]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain
[3:32:27.320 --> 3:32:31.280]  your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate
[3:32:31.280 --> 3:32:35.840]  nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting
[3:32:35.840 --> 3:32:40.040]  the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids
[3:32:40.040 --> 3:32:45.560]  it needs to do its healing work, you need to check out InfowarsTeam.com.
[3:32:45.560 --> 3:32:47.400]  Give your body the gift of good nutrition.
[3:32:47.400 --> 3:33:14.240]  Head over to InfowarsTeam.com, your body will be very grateful.
[3:33:14.240 --> 3:33:18.800]  So we're talking about super flares, and the implications of a super flare, we've talked
[3:33:18.800 --> 3:33:22.600]  about that before, and all the scientists just, they almost like to kind of like nerd
[3:33:22.600 --> 3:33:26.040]  out on the possibility of a super flare, because it's such an insane thing, but it's a very
[3:33:26.040 --> 3:33:28.080]  devastating thing.
[3:33:28.080 --> 3:33:31.960]  But first, before we go into the super flare, and what could be going down with that, I
[3:33:31.960 --> 3:33:36.520]  want to tell you about, first of all, we also have a video coming up, but before we even
[3:33:36.520 --> 3:33:39.800]  go to that, there's just so much stuff on the show, truly, there's so much news and
[3:33:39.800 --> 3:33:42.040]  so many videos and things to do.
[3:33:42.040 --> 3:33:47.840]  If you go to InfowarsLife.com right now, the ultimate cleanse pack, which is oxy powder,
[3:33:47.840 --> 3:33:54.280]  liver shield, and deep cleanse, is 20% off, 20% off, and it has everything you need to
[3:33:54.280 --> 3:33:57.960]  really start cleansing and doing a proper liver cleanse.
[3:33:57.960 --> 3:34:06.680]  So I've done about seven liver cleanses, and let me tell you something, it's a dramatic
[3:34:06.680 --> 3:34:07.680]  difference.
[3:34:07.680 --> 3:34:11.580]  I don't want to get into too much detail here, because it's kind of disgusting, you can imagine
[3:34:11.580 --> 3:34:13.520]  what happens when you're cleansing the liver, right?
[3:34:13.520 --> 3:34:16.960]  When you take these products, and you can take them individually, by the way, of course,
[3:34:16.960 --> 3:34:20.360]  you can take the oxy powder, the liver shield, and the deep cleanse individually, you don't
[3:34:20.360 --> 3:34:21.760]  even have to do the full liver cleanse.
[3:34:21.760 --> 3:34:26.040]  You can just take it daily, and it will definitely make a difference.
[3:34:26.040 --> 3:34:31.000]  But if you want to do a liver cleanse, if you want to do a liver cleanse, you will not
[3:34:31.000 --> 3:34:32.000]  regret it.
[3:34:32.000 --> 3:34:34.920]  I've talked to a bunch of people that were just like, oh, liver cleanse, I don't know,
[3:34:34.920 --> 3:34:36.480]  I don't know if I could handle that.
[3:34:36.480 --> 3:34:40.160]  Let me tell you, you'll want to handle it, and when you do it, and you see what comes
[3:34:40.160 --> 3:34:44.040]  out of you, you'll realize it's the real deal.
[3:34:44.040 --> 3:34:48.160]  If you go to m4slife.com, and click on the Ultimate Cleans Pack, you can read the reviews
[3:34:48.160 --> 3:34:49.480]  for yourself.
[3:34:49.480 --> 3:34:55.160]  Not just for me, there's lots of listeners that are on there, talking about their experiences
[3:34:55.160 --> 3:34:56.160]  detailing it.
[3:34:56.160 --> 3:34:57.720]  If you click on liver shield, you can read those reviews.
[3:34:57.720 --> 3:35:00.960]  The Ultimate Cleans Pack is new, obviously, so it might not have all those reviews, but
[3:35:00.960 --> 3:35:04.960]  there are thousands throughout oxy powder, liver shield, and deep cleanse.
[3:35:04.960 --> 3:35:08.400]  And plus it's 20% off, so now's the time to stock up on all those products.
[3:35:08.400 --> 3:35:13.200]  To me, you're going to probably get them anyway if you're a regular user, so why not get
[3:35:13.200 --> 3:35:14.320]  them when they're 20% off?
[3:35:14.320 --> 3:35:20.560]  So today is the day, Ultimate Cleans Pack, 20% off, but don't take it from me, right?
[3:35:20.560 --> 3:35:25.320]  Take it from someone that is way more attractive that recently did a liver cleanse with her
[3:35:25.320 --> 3:35:26.920]  friend, and that's Leanne McAdoo.
[3:35:26.920 --> 3:35:31.680]  So we're going to play her video and her results of the liver cleanse, and she's going to break
[3:35:31.680 --> 3:35:32.680]  it down for you.
[3:35:32.680 --> 3:35:33.680]  So let's watch that video.
[3:35:33.680 --> 3:35:38.400]  Obviously, well, myself and Emmy Robin are here, we're getting ready to do the liver
[3:35:38.400 --> 3:35:40.240]  shield cleanse.
[3:35:40.240 --> 3:35:41.240]  Very excited.
[3:35:41.240 --> 3:35:48.480]  As you can see here, the night before the first day is all about prepping, so that is
[3:35:48.480 --> 3:35:53.960]  what we have going on here, and I felt pretty good rolling out of the grocery store looking
[3:35:53.960 --> 3:35:54.960]  like a health nut.
[3:35:54.960 --> 3:35:59.960]  Well, we're checking in for day two of the InfoWars Life liver shield cleanse.
[3:35:59.960 --> 3:36:05.800]  I got to say, crankier today than yesterday, Emmy to the rescue, once again, she's brought
[3:36:05.800 --> 3:36:11.520]  me some delicious food to try to tame the beast, she's being a real Hillary Clinton.
[3:36:11.520 --> 3:36:14.880]  Yeah, but we're still hanging in there, hope you guys are too.
[3:36:14.880 --> 3:36:21.600]  Be sure to check out the product, InfoWarsLife.com, it's the liver shield cleanse along with
[3:36:21.600 --> 3:36:26.240]  the oxy powder, and you don't have to go all the way and take the liver cleanse challenge,
[3:36:26.240 --> 3:36:31.560]  but I highly recommend it, and that's me, Evil Queen, on day two.
[3:36:31.560 --> 3:36:32.560]  You can do it.
[3:36:32.560 --> 3:36:33.560]  I can do it.
[3:36:33.560 --> 3:36:34.560]  You can do it.
[3:36:34.560 --> 3:36:38.920]  Hi guys, here we are checking in day three of the InfoWarsLife liver shield cleanse.
[3:36:38.920 --> 3:36:43.840]  I got to say today, I thought I was expecting it to be really intense and cranky and bad,
[3:36:43.840 --> 3:36:45.160]  but I feel pretty good.
[3:36:45.160 --> 3:36:46.160]  Nice.
[3:36:46.160 --> 3:36:47.160]  How about you?
[3:36:47.160 --> 3:36:48.160]  I'm glad.
[3:36:48.160 --> 3:36:49.160]  I got a little dizzy today.
[3:36:49.160 --> 3:36:53.640]  I'm not going to lie, and then the cravings have come on, like I said, on day three.
[3:36:53.640 --> 3:36:56.640]  It's always towards the end of the day, of course, when I was driving over here.
[3:36:56.640 --> 3:36:57.640]  Yes.
[3:36:57.640 --> 3:36:58.640]  Here, commercial for cake pops.
[3:36:58.640 --> 3:37:03.640]  I don't even eat cake, nor do I eat cake pops, but they sound delicious right now,
[3:37:03.640 --> 3:37:09.520]  so I might have to try one on Monday or Tuesday, but yeah, it's weird.
[3:37:09.520 --> 3:37:13.920]  Day three, for some reason, no matter how many times I cleanse, and I've cleansed a lot.
[3:37:13.920 --> 3:37:16.760]  Day three, I always just get the strangest cravings.
[3:37:16.760 --> 3:37:20.960]  We're not using pharmaceutical drugs, we're not, you know, I've seen so many posts of
[3:37:20.960 --> 3:37:24.880]  people getting their gallbladders taken out, and people don't understand, like, it's not
[3:37:24.880 --> 3:37:29.520]  like your wisdom teeth, like your gallbladder is a huge horse organ along with your liver
[3:37:29.520 --> 3:37:34.960]  that cleanses your body, and you can't just take that out because it helps cleanse the
[3:37:34.960 --> 3:37:39.120]  body, so why not try a cleanse and get rid of the stuff in the gallbladder?
[3:37:39.120 --> 3:37:43.720]  As promised, we are checking in for day four of the Infowars Life Liver Shield Cleanse.
[3:37:43.720 --> 3:37:45.520]  I gotta say, Emmy, you were right.
[3:37:45.520 --> 3:37:47.840]  Day four, I feel tremendous.
[3:37:47.840 --> 3:37:54.440]  I woke up this morning feeling really light, a lot of clarity, no hunger pains, and I actually
[3:37:54.440 --> 3:37:58.480]  felt like I was floating through the grocery store, everyone was sort of looking at me
[3:37:58.480 --> 3:38:03.520]  like, oh, pardon me, excuse me, and I wasn't in there cute or anything, like it just was
[3:38:03.520 --> 3:38:06.120]  like, I feel like I am glowing.
[3:38:06.120 --> 3:38:08.120]  And you're not even that hungry, right?
[3:38:08.120 --> 3:38:12.080]  No, not at all, I didn't even want to eat today because I felt so good.
[3:38:12.080 --> 3:38:16.680]  So obviously this cleanse for me has really showed me that it is all about retraining
[3:38:16.680 --> 3:38:17.800]  our brain.
[3:38:17.800 --> 3:38:21.520]  Like I said, how can you resist tyranny if you can't resist the taco stand?
[3:38:21.520 --> 3:38:25.080]  Now if you want to see our before and after photos, I think they said they've got them
[3:38:25.080 --> 3:38:26.280]  ready.
[3:38:26.280 --> 3:38:31.720]  Like I said, mine aren't before and almost after because I'm not done with my flesh,
[3:38:31.720 --> 3:38:39.160]  but you can see those if you go to infowars.com forward slash show, whoa, Emmy Fletch.
[3:38:39.160 --> 3:38:44.320]  And I was, I promise you, I promise you, I was not sticking out in that first picture.
[3:38:44.320 --> 3:38:49.640]  I just literally was relaxed and even in the second picture, I was relaxed, but like looking
[3:38:49.640 --> 3:38:50.640]  really crazy.
[3:38:50.640 --> 3:38:52.640]  Look at those butts in your side.
[3:38:52.640 --> 3:38:55.200]  No, I know I can see the muscles in my stomach.
[3:38:55.200 --> 3:38:56.960]  It's nuts in my legs.
[3:38:56.960 --> 3:38:58.360]  I feel like my legs look skinnier.
[3:38:58.360 --> 3:38:59.360]  I don't know.
[3:38:59.360 --> 3:39:03.760]  I started off at like a, I mean, for my height, I'm almost five nine.
[3:39:03.760 --> 3:39:08.440]  So I started off at relatively healthy weight because I had done the liver cleanse in July
[3:39:08.440 --> 3:39:12.120]  and then I went straight into working and on a production for three months where I was
[3:39:12.120 --> 3:39:15.200]  working 18 hour days on my feet doing like eight miles a day.
[3:39:15.200 --> 3:39:18.280]  So I mean, I wasn't super out of shape, but when I started that first liver cleanse,
[3:39:18.280 --> 3:39:19.760]  I was pretty out of shape.
[3:39:19.760 --> 3:39:20.760]  So that before and after.
[3:39:20.760 --> 3:39:21.760]  Yeah.
[3:39:21.760 --> 3:39:25.440]  You said you're actually at the lowest weight of your weight in a decade, I guess.
[3:39:25.440 --> 3:39:26.440]  Yeah.
[3:39:26.440 --> 3:39:27.440]  Pretty much.
[3:39:27.440 --> 3:39:30.160]  I'm almost back to where when I was a fitness model, which would they have, do they have
[3:39:30.160 --> 3:39:32.240]  mine before and almost afters?
[3:39:32.240 --> 3:39:33.240]  Are we going to hold those off?
[3:39:33.240 --> 3:39:34.240]  Oh my goodness gracious.
[3:39:34.240 --> 3:39:35.240]  Look at you.
[3:39:35.240 --> 3:39:36.240]  Yeah.
[3:39:36.240 --> 3:39:39.760]  I can see it in your arms and your legs.
[3:39:39.760 --> 3:39:43.800]  Well where I really see it and where I really wanted it was in my sides.
[3:39:43.800 --> 3:39:47.480]  I guess you would call that the spare tire and you can actually see where there's that
[3:39:47.480 --> 3:39:48.480]  little roll.
[3:39:48.480 --> 3:39:49.480]  Oh my God.
[3:39:49.480 --> 3:39:50.480]  This is so embarrassing.
[3:39:50.480 --> 3:39:54.960]  There's that little roll kind of on the, like the back fat and you can see it's, it's
[3:39:54.960 --> 3:39:55.960]  gone away.
[3:39:55.960 --> 3:39:56.960]  Look below your chin.
[3:39:56.960 --> 3:39:57.960]  Look below your chin though.
[3:39:57.960 --> 3:39:58.960]  Oh my gosh.
[3:39:58.960 --> 3:40:01.120]  You see, it was a little bit in your face too.
[3:40:01.120 --> 3:40:03.360]  That's where I saw it big time the first time around.
[3:40:03.360 --> 3:40:05.200]  There you go everyone before and afters.
[3:40:05.200 --> 3:40:07.440]  And like I said, mine is not even an after yet.
[3:40:07.440 --> 3:40:12.440]  I should probably take more pictures later when all the sodium has left my body.
[3:40:12.440 --> 3:40:16.040]  I wanted to let everybody know this cleanse is on sale right now.
[3:40:16.040 --> 3:40:17.440]  The liver shield is on sale.

[3:40:39.160 --> 3:40:44.080]  All right, there's Leigh Ann's video and I'll tell you what, it's not as hard as you think

[3:40:53.800 --> 3:40:54.800]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[3:40:54.800 --> 3:40:59.480]  Anyway, so back to some news and we're going to take your calls here in a second and answer
[3:40:59.480 --> 3:41:01.080]  some questions coming in on Twitter.
[3:41:01.080 --> 3:41:03.960]  So keep those questions coming.
[3:41:03.960 --> 3:41:07.080]  Then the super flare, what is the super flare?
[3:41:07.080 --> 3:41:10.480]  Researchers explain devastating consequences of an eruption from the sun.
[3:41:10.480 --> 3:41:16.600]  Basically, if there was a super flare from the sun, it would break down radio communication,
[3:41:16.600 --> 3:41:21.160]  power supplies will be destroyed and threaten the ability of our atmosphere.
[3:41:21.160 --> 3:41:22.600]  Now why am I talking about this?
[3:41:22.600 --> 3:41:26.000]  Am I talking about this to scare you that something you cannot control could happen
[3:41:26.000 --> 3:41:29.120]  and ruin your life and potentially kill you, most likely kill you?
[3:41:29.120 --> 3:41:35.640]  Now, I'm talking about this to put everything into perspective because it teaches us a valuable,
[3:41:35.640 --> 3:41:37.400]  valuable point.
[3:41:37.400 --> 3:41:41.520]  When we watch the media, when we go home and watch the nightly news, if that's what you
[3:41:41.520 --> 3:41:47.440]  watch on television, it's a juxtaposition from this because there's a solar flare that
[3:41:47.440 --> 3:41:48.840]  could happen at any time.
[3:41:48.840 --> 3:41:53.920]  It could wipe out a large percentage of the population, but they're not constantly talking
[3:41:53.920 --> 3:41:55.120]  about that.
[3:41:55.120 --> 3:41:58.760]  When you go in your car and you drive down the street, you could get in an accident.
[3:41:58.760 --> 3:41:59.760]  You could die.
[3:41:59.760 --> 3:42:02.040]  They could hack your vehicles.
[3:42:02.040 --> 3:42:08.880]  You're more likely to die from the crap you're eating in the food supply than the local murderer.
[3:42:08.880 --> 3:42:14.280]  But once again, we must remember our focus is taken away and put towards whatever it
[3:42:14.280 --> 3:42:16.320]  is, if it bleeds, it leads, right?
[3:42:16.320 --> 3:42:18.440]  Whatever it is, we're focused on it.
[3:42:18.440 --> 3:42:22.120]  Even very, very tragic events where maybe five or 10 people die, that's all we focus
[3:42:22.120 --> 3:42:26.320]  on for like a week or two weeks instead of the more realistic threats.
[3:42:26.320 --> 3:42:31.080]  So that's just a reminder that the narrative of the mainstream media does not necessarily
[3:42:31.080 --> 3:42:33.000]  correlate to any form of reality.
[3:42:33.000 --> 3:42:35.560]  We're not freaking out about solar flares all day, are we?
[3:42:35.560 --> 3:42:36.560]  That would be a horrible show.
[3:42:36.560 --> 3:42:40.080]  If I sat here for three hours and talked about solar flares, that would be terrible.
[3:42:40.080 --> 3:42:41.400]  No, no, no.
[3:42:41.400 --> 3:42:47.760]  But just remember the rabbit hole that you're sometimes sent down when you go into the mania.
[3:42:47.760 --> 3:42:50.000]  They don't tell you about the things that are actually a threat.
[3:42:50.000 --> 3:42:52.240]  Sometimes they tell you about a bunch of mumbo jumbo.
[3:42:52.240 --> 3:42:54.480]  Anyway, so we're about to take these calls.
[3:42:54.480 --> 3:42:58.960]  And the question was pertaining to this article, which is very, very important, because we
[3:42:58.960 --> 3:43:01.000]  could talk about news all day.
[3:43:01.000 --> 3:43:04.560]  But for 80 years, young Americans have been getting more anxious and depressed, and no
[3:43:04.560 --> 3:43:05.880]  one is quite sure why.
[3:43:05.880 --> 3:43:10.920]  So for 80 years, not just today's generation of young Americans, and then the story about
[3:43:10.920 --> 3:43:14.240]  how depression is more than mental disorder, it affects the whole organism, it basically
[3:43:14.240 --> 3:43:15.240]  breaks you down.
[3:43:15.240 --> 3:43:18.720]  It breaks you down, it makes you sick, it makes you want to die, okay?
[3:43:18.720 --> 3:43:20.960]  And for 80 years, this has been going on.
[3:43:20.960 --> 3:43:26.880]  I asked you guys to call in and tweet me whatever, and tell me why you think people have been
[3:43:26.880 --> 3:43:30.200]  more depressed and more beaten down than ever before.
[3:43:30.200 --> 3:43:31.200]  Tell me why.
[3:43:31.200 --> 3:43:34.200]  I'll tell you my reason, and then I'll take some calls here.
[3:43:34.200 --> 3:43:36.520]  A short example.
[3:43:36.520 --> 3:43:40.920]  When you're a young kid, you have so many dreams and so many passions and ideas, you
[3:43:40.920 --> 3:43:44.600]  might want to do something crazy like being an astronaut, you might even want to be something
[3:43:44.600 --> 3:43:46.600]  impossible like Superman or something.
[3:43:46.600 --> 3:43:52.760]  But what happens is, all these beautiful ideas and the idea, even of grassroots, you know,
[3:43:52.760 --> 3:43:56.200]  liberty and resistance and all those things that we were brought up to think that we could
[3:43:56.200 --> 3:44:00.560]  do, what happens is you go into the establishment meat grinder.
[3:44:00.560 --> 3:44:03.600]  And in that meat grinder, you're told that you can't do any of that.
[3:44:03.600 --> 3:44:07.320]  No, you got to go, you got to go to school, you got to go to college, you got to get a
[3:44:07.320 --> 3:44:11.600]  job, you got to get a, you know, you got to do all those things, you got to go in debt,
[3:44:11.600 --> 3:44:15.000]  you got to get that house, you got to get that car payment, because if you don't have
[3:44:15.000 --> 3:44:20.120]  that, you're not cool, and you better be wearing the nicest brands to support those corporations.
[3:44:20.120 --> 3:44:24.600]  You better be wearing the nicest everything, nicest shoes, and you better be presentable,
[3:44:24.600 --> 3:44:28.960]  and you better act nice, and you better not offend anyone, because if you offend somebody,
[3:44:28.960 --> 3:44:30.200]  that's really, really bad.
[3:44:30.200 --> 3:44:34.400]  So you better fit in this little box where you're easy to control, and you're funding
[3:44:34.400 --> 3:44:39.280]  the corporations, and you're not thinking too big, because that could be devastating.
[3:44:39.280 --> 3:44:46.920]  That could ripple the establishment fragile, fake glass around you, the trap, the mental
[3:44:46.920 --> 3:44:51.720]  trap that you are a worthless little creature, and you better fit in that box.
[3:44:51.720 --> 3:44:55.760]  But what happens is, when you go in that box, because you're told that you're going to get
[3:44:55.760 --> 3:45:00.080]  social proof if you act cool, and if you're politically correct, and you go to the right
[3:45:00.080 --> 3:45:05.320]  colleges, and you wear those rings, and you go out, and you get in debt, you get a house,
[3:45:05.320 --> 3:45:08.480]  you get a nice house for your family, you get that car, you've been told so could you
[3:45:08.480 --> 3:45:09.480]  get those clothes?
[3:45:09.480 --> 3:45:13.760]  And by the way, I have a nice car, I have nice clothes, I like nice things, but I don't
[3:45:13.760 --> 3:45:16.920]  buy into this lie that it's everything, and that you're worthless without it.
[3:45:16.920 --> 3:45:21.160]  And again, this is not attacking capitalism, this is the establishment system, turning
[3:45:21.160 --> 3:45:24.440]  your brain into the meat grinder, okay?
[3:45:24.440 --> 3:45:28.120]  Putting it in the meat grinder, making you think you're worthless unless you follow their
[3:45:28.120 --> 3:45:29.120]  system.
[3:45:29.120 --> 3:45:32.240]  But what happens at the end of the brown brick road, not the yellow brick road, the brown
[3:45:32.240 --> 3:45:36.760]  brick road, is you sit there and you're depressed, because you grow up thinking all these amazing
[3:45:36.760 --> 3:45:40.280]  things are possible, and then the system tells you it's not.
[3:45:40.280 --> 3:45:43.640]  It tells you it's not possible, you have to go in there, a little system, you go down
[3:45:43.640 --> 3:45:46.760]  the whole road, you do it all, you said, I tried so hard, I thought I was going to be
[3:45:46.760 --> 3:45:48.960]  happy now, but you're not happy.
[3:45:48.960 --> 3:45:55.400]  Because you were told and fed a lie, a bunch of horse BS, horse BS, I made that up, not
[3:45:55.400 --> 3:45:57.560]  just BS, horse BS, that's two animals.
[3:45:57.560 --> 3:46:01.160]  So you're lied to your entire life, you get to the end of it, and you said, I tried so
[3:46:01.160 --> 3:46:02.160]  hard, what's going on?
[3:46:02.160 --> 3:46:06.240]  Oh, you were fed a lie, you bought into the system, you bought into the establishment,
[3:46:06.240 --> 3:46:09.200]  that's what free thinking is the way to be happy.
[3:46:09.200 --> 3:46:12.120]  Actually caring about something, standing up for something, being independent, thinking
[3:46:12.120 --> 3:46:14.800]  for yourself, that's the route to happiness.
[3:46:14.800 --> 3:46:18.840]  Not buying into the systems lie to you that you're going to be worthless unless you align
[3:46:18.840 --> 3:46:23.480]  with it and go down the brown brick road, the black brick road, to really just total
[3:46:23.480 --> 3:46:28.560]  mediocracy in debt and enslavement, where you have 50 credit cards to keep up with it.
[3:46:28.560 --> 3:46:31.760]  And I know people like this, I'm not trashing you if you're like this, I have empathy for
[3:46:31.760 --> 3:46:34.320]  you and I want to bring you on to the other side.
[3:46:34.320 --> 3:46:37.640]  Okay, because this isn't just the grass is greener on this side, there's actually grass
[3:46:37.640 --> 3:46:38.640]  on this side.
[3:46:38.640 --> 3:46:41.360]  Over there is decaying, rotting, dirt and death.
[3:46:41.360 --> 3:46:45.440]  Come over to this side of free thought and ideology, please, please do it.
[3:46:45.440 --> 3:46:48.600]  You don't have to buy into the system and be depressed.
[3:46:48.600 --> 3:46:51.640]  Young people, so-called young people, it's been for 80 years, so it's people that are
[3:46:51.640 --> 3:46:55.480]  actually dead now, have been depressed because of this in my view.
[3:46:55.480 --> 3:46:59.000]  We're going to take some calls and see if they agree or if they disagree.
[3:46:59.000 --> 3:47:00.960]  That's great, I want to hear everyone's opinion.
[3:47:00.960 --> 3:47:05.200]  Let's talk to Tony in Minnesota, he wants to talk about his views on this.
[3:47:05.200 --> 3:47:06.200]  What's up, Tony?
[3:47:06.200 --> 3:47:07.200]  What do you think?
[3:47:07.200 --> 3:47:08.920]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[3:47:08.920 --> 3:47:14.120]  First, my background is I was governor appointed to the Minnesota Behavioral Health and Therapy
[3:47:14.120 --> 3:47:20.080]  Board, Hennepin County Children's Mental Health Council, executive member there, and so I've
[3:47:20.080 --> 3:47:23.880]  been doing this for over 16 years.
[3:47:23.880 --> 3:47:28.560]  The main thing, one point I wanted to make is that my son, I asked him, what do you want
[3:47:28.560 --> 3:47:32.200]  to be when you grow up, and he said, well, all the things I wanted to be, I can't be,
[3:47:32.200 --> 3:47:33.200]  and those were superheroes.
[3:47:33.200 --> 3:47:38.360]  So I told him, well, what are some transferable things that you can apply to the real world?
[3:47:38.360 --> 3:47:42.800]  No, but here's the thing, Tony, Tony, I think he could be a superhero, okay?
[3:47:42.800 --> 3:47:49.200]  He doesn't have to be Superman with bulletproof ribcage and laser vision and stuff, but what
[3:47:49.200 --> 3:47:50.200]  is a superhero?
[3:47:50.200 --> 3:47:51.200]  It's above a hero.
[3:47:51.200 --> 3:47:52.200]  What is a hero?
[3:47:52.200 --> 3:47:53.200]  Someone that helps someone, someone that saves people.
[3:47:53.200 --> 3:47:56.720]  To me, there's a million superheroes in the world, and I'm not being cheesy.
[3:47:56.720 --> 3:47:58.720]  This isn't some cheesy stuff, okay?
[3:47:58.720 --> 3:47:59.720]  This is the real deal.
[3:47:59.720 --> 3:48:00.920]  There's a million superheroes in the world.
[3:48:00.920 --> 3:48:02.280]  There's people that actually do good.
[3:48:02.280 --> 3:48:03.280]  There's heroes everywhere.
[3:48:03.280 --> 3:48:04.280]  You know what I mean?
[3:48:04.280 --> 3:48:05.280]  I love the idea.
[3:48:05.280 --> 3:48:06.280]  I used to want to be Superman.
[3:48:06.280 --> 3:48:07.280]  That's what I wanted to be.
[3:48:07.280 --> 3:48:10.760]  The idea of Superman going out and helping people and actually doing something, that
[3:48:10.760 --> 3:48:11.760]  is totally transferable.
[3:48:11.760 --> 3:48:14.560]  I'm not, I get where you're going with this, but it's totally transferable.
[3:48:14.560 --> 3:48:15.560]  I mean-
[3:48:15.560 --> 3:48:19.840]  Okay, and the other thing, the other point I wanted to make was a lot of the, a lot
[3:48:19.840 --> 3:48:25.680]  of the, a lot of it is about coping mechanisms, but now with my daughter, they, the schools
[3:48:25.680 --> 3:48:30.800]  have got this gender confusion going on where they're programming the kids, and so now the
[3:48:30.800 --> 3:48:36.160]  guidance counselor put her on a gender reassignment list without her knowledge or consent, and
[3:48:36.160 --> 3:48:37.160]  you know that-
[3:48:37.160 --> 3:48:40.960]  To put your kid on a gender reassignment list without your knowledge or consent?
[3:48:40.960 --> 3:48:45.160]  Yes, and the problem is, is that we already had her in therapy because we were explaining
[3:48:45.160 --> 3:48:49.400]  to her that, you know, once you do this, you'll no longer have orgasms, and your lymph system
[3:48:49.400 --> 3:48:54.120]  will no longer be working properly, and that's where cancer lives, so we're, we're dealing
[3:48:54.120 --> 3:48:55.120]  with that-
[3:48:55.120 --> 3:48:56.120]  How old is your child?
[3:48:56.120 --> 3:48:58.120]  What, where, where is this happening?
[3:48:58.120 --> 3:49:01.080]  This is in Minnesota, and, and I don't want to mention anything-
[3:49:01.080 --> 3:49:04.080]  No, I don't want the names or anything, I just, I just meant, okay, it's in Minnesota.
[3:49:04.080 --> 3:49:05.080]  And how old is your child?
[3:49:05.080 --> 3:49:06.960]  I don't want any personal details, please.
[3:49:06.960 --> 3:49:07.960]  But-
[3:49:07.960 --> 3:49:13.440]  17, and she, she has a boyfriend, she's not even gay, and so this is, they've got her
[3:49:13.440 --> 3:49:19.080]  talk, you know, it's this whole group of folks there that, you know, it's, it's kind
[3:49:19.080 --> 3:49:26.920]  of a, definitely a onslaught of what I call genital mutilation, and possibly, what do
[3:49:26.920 --> 3:49:32.080]  you call that, sterilization tactics, like creating modern day eunuchs in this fashion
[3:49:32.080 --> 3:49:39.640]  just for the industrial complexes, recidivism, because the studies show that more kids after
[3:49:39.640 --> 3:49:45.640]  the reassignment are suicidal, and 60% of them want to be, to have it reversed, but
[3:49:45.640 --> 3:49:48.920]  to find out that they can't, they commit suicide after that.
[3:49:48.920 --> 3:49:52.680]  Well, I have no idea what's going on with your situation, but that, I'm, yeah, it's
[3:49:52.680 --> 3:49:56.960]  very sad, a lot of people that ultimately want to kill themselves for whatever reason,
[3:49:56.960 --> 3:50:00.240]  but that, that sounds, yeah, a lot of crazy stuff going on.
[3:50:00.240 --> 3:50:04.640]  Well, thank you so much for your call, Tony, and let's go ahead and go to a few more here,
[3:50:04.640 --> 3:50:06.320]  get to as many as we can.
[3:50:06.320 --> 3:50:09.640]  Let's talk to Shane in Carolina, North Carolina, he wants to comment on it.
[3:50:09.640 --> 3:50:11.640]  Why do you think people are so upset and depressed?
[3:50:11.640 --> 3:50:19.320]  Well, there's various reasons, but in that article, you, you see that they, they claim
[3:50:19.320 --> 3:50:23.320]  that nobody knows why, which I think is the most absolutely ridiculous thing I've ever
[3:50:23.320 --> 3:50:28.240]  heard, because it's, it's pretty obvious why, and there are lots of reasons, including
[3:50:28.240 --> 3:50:33.760]  everything that you've said in your opening dialogue on the topic, I completely concur
[3:50:33.760 --> 3:50:36.320]  with everything that you've said.
[3:50:36.320 --> 3:50:40.440]  Quick comment on that last caller, wow, if someone was doing that to my kid, I, I, I,
[3:50:40.440 --> 3:50:44.280]  I think it's time to pull him out of school, even if they're senior, that is, I didn't
[3:50:44.280 --> 3:50:47.760]  even know that, that kind of thing was going on, I know things have gone pretty far, but
[3:50:47.760 --> 3:50:48.760]  that's outrageous.
[3:50:48.760 --> 3:50:49.760]  Definitely.
[3:50:49.760 --> 3:50:50.760]  Hey, we're about to jump to break.
[3:50:50.760 --> 3:50:54.720]  That does sound totally outrageous, definitely have to look into that one, but we'll be right
[3:50:54.720 --> 3:50:57.520]  back with another segment, we'll take some more calls and cover some more news.
[3:50:57.520 --> 3:50:59.640]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[3:50:59.640 --> 3:51:00.640]  Thanks for watching.
[3:51:00.640 --> 3:51:05.960]  Do you or someone you know suffer from chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol, or irregular
[3:51:05.960 --> 3:51:07.200]  heartbeat?
[3:51:07.200 --> 3:51:11.640]  Are you looking for a more natural solution to overcome these health challenges?
[3:51:11.640 --> 3:51:17.320]  You hear the ads all the time, if this stuff's so good, why doesn't my doctor prescribe it?
[3:51:17.320 --> 3:51:20.920]  That's easy, there's more money in treating symptoms.
[3:51:20.920 --> 3:51:27.000]  Extendivite heart tonic does want you to be as healthy as you can be, and it really works.
[3:51:27.000 --> 3:51:31.000]  Take Extendivite for six months and your doctor will say, I don't know what you're doing,
[3:51:31.000 --> 3:51:33.560]  but don't stop, it's working for you.
[3:51:33.560 --> 3:51:36.040]  Get the dependability of Extendivite.
[3:51:36.040 --> 3:51:38.040]  See how you feel in six months.

[3:52:40.000 --> 3:53:05.080]  It's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus can inflict severe
[3:53:05.080 --> 3:53:10.240]  damage in the human body. Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has
[3:53:10.240 --> 3:53:15.960]  been developed. Supernatural silver is a revolutionary broad spectrum antibacterial,

[3:53:28.400 --> 3:53:33.720]  technology that is highly effective against coals, flus, infections, food poisoning, and yeast.

[3:54:08.840 --> 3:54:14.040]  All right, it's the last segment of the show. It's been a good show. It's been definitely a lot of
[3:54:14.040 --> 3:54:18.760]  interesting stuff talked about today. We're going to take as many more calls as we possibly can,
[3:54:18.760 --> 3:54:23.560]  and if callers are listening, I want to go through you guys and we have to keep it under a minute,
[3:54:23.560 --> 3:54:26.720]  even 30 seconds if you could just state your point. That would be awesome so we could get
[3:54:26.720 --> 3:54:31.600]  some more in. I'm going to blitz through some news here and also want to remember you to go to
[3:54:31.600 --> 3:54:36.520]  infowarslife.com and get the ultimate cleanse pack. It's 20% off, oxy powder, liver shield, deep
[3:54:36.520 --> 3:54:41.400]  cleanse, start cleansing, stop putting it off, do it. It'll actually make a difference in your
[3:54:41.400 --> 3:54:46.600]  life. All right, so people with Rage Disorder twice as likely to have Toxoplasmosis. So you've
[3:54:46.600 --> 3:54:51.880]  heard about crazy cat ladies, right? Crazy cat people. People with tons of cats, there's always
[3:54:51.880 --> 3:54:56.520]  been this kind of, I guess you could call it some type of a superstition or whatever, that they're
[3:54:56.520 --> 3:55:02.720]  crazy or the normal people. Well, Toxoplasmosis is basically a parasite that has been linked
[3:55:02.720 --> 3:55:08.640]  with cat feces, and I've been reading and talked about this for years, but now I think most people
[3:55:08.640 --> 3:55:12.560]  are finally starting to understand it's real. I remember being with Alex actually hanging out,
[3:55:12.560 --> 3:55:18.680]  talking to some people about Toxoplasmosis, saying, you realize that cats that go outside can get
[3:55:18.680 --> 3:55:22.640]  Toxoplasmosis, which is a parasite, and they go to the bathroom and you clean their litter and
[3:55:22.640 --> 3:55:26.160]  your face is right there cleaning it. You're inhaling that stuff and it goes in your brain
[3:55:26.160 --> 3:55:33.000]  tissue and they're like, no, you just don't like cats. I have cats. I like cats. No, they have a
[3:55:33.000 --> 3:55:39.760]  brain parasite in their feces that can go into your brain and live in your tissue and it's been
[3:55:39.760 --> 3:55:44.480]  linked to schizophrenia. Let's see what it is. Exactly. It's been linked to schizophrenia,
[3:55:44.480 --> 3:55:50.080]  bipolar disorder, suicide behavior, and now people with rage disorder are twice as likely to have it.
[3:55:50.080 --> 3:55:55.760]  So very interesting stuff, something to consider. A little bit of ridiculous news. I always have
[3:55:55.760 --> 3:56:01.160]  a little stack of ridiculous news. TMZ sued for naming wrong rapper who cut off his penis,
[3:56:01.160 --> 3:56:07.920]  and that reminded me of jurors in Hulk Hogan vs. Gawker trial say they made absolutely correct
[3:56:07.920 --> 3:56:13.600]  decision awarding Hogan $140 million for posting his sex tape and just commenting on them and
[3:56:13.600 --> 3:56:17.880]  stuff. And it's interesting to note that, in fact, we should probably pull up a picture. If you
[3:56:17.880 --> 3:56:24.440]  just look up Hulk Hogan court do rag, he went into court. He went into, I guess it was a federal court
[3:56:24.440 --> 3:56:30.520]  and wore a do rag and still won $140 million. That's when you know you have a strong case.
[3:56:30.520 --> 3:56:36.640]  So anyway, Saudi Prince sued by owner of notorious Hollywood Hills party mansion who claims to
[3:56:36.640 --> 3:56:41.560]  trash $100,000 a month rental pad with wild cocaine and stripper fueled parties. Sounds very
[3:56:41.560 --> 3:56:47.800]  Christian. Texas women furious after home mistakenly demolished. It's helpful. New
[3:56:47.800 --> 3:56:52.640]  study claims people with higher IQs don't require large social circles. All right,
[3:56:52.640 --> 3:56:55.680]  now we're going to try and blitz through these calls. Last thoughts and comments. We're going to
[3:56:55.680 --> 3:56:59.280]  go to Fred in Pennsylvania. Why do you think people are so upset with the state of the world?
[3:56:59.280 --> 3:57:08.200]  Yeah, I was going to be a caller on your program, but this is absolutely the worst hour. The most
[3:57:08.200 --> 3:57:18.480]  disjointed, pointless, hyperactive brain damaged hour that I've ever heard on Alex Jones. And that's
[3:57:18.480 --> 3:57:23.120]  saying a lot because I've been listening since 2000. Thank you very much. I appreciate the
[3:57:23.120 --> 3:57:28.560]  compliment that it's a very hyperactive hour. Yes, we've talked about a number of discussions,
[3:57:28.560 --> 3:57:33.080]  perhaps a little intellectual discussion as well, talking about more than one or two pieces of
[3:57:33.080 --> 3:57:36.560]  news. I know it's a little crazy. It's a little high speed, right? It's a little bit too much
[3:57:36.560 --> 3:57:44.000]  sometimes for some people. Even even talking about something that goes beyond maybe NFL,
[3:57:44.000 --> 3:57:49.960]  or the Super Bowl, or Kim Kardashian, or even just what the other news people are talking about,
[3:57:49.960 --> 3:57:55.120]  just we have to just continually hit on one point for the whole show. You're right. I apologize
[3:57:55.120 --> 3:57:59.600]  that it's a little bit too fast for you. Anyway, thanks for watching everyone. Sorry we couldn't
[3:57:59.600 --> 3:58:03.840]  get to the rest of the calls and there is also more news, but Alex will be back from tomorrow
[3:58:03.840 --> 3:58:09.000]  11 to 2 p.m. Central and then two to three for the fourth hour. I'm Anthony Gucciardi. Thanks
[3:58:09.000 --> 3:58:38.000]  so much for watching the fast-paced fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
