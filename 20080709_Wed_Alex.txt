[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:05.000 --> 00:09.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:09.000 --> 00:14.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:14.000 --> 00:30.000]  Very important broadcast lined up for you today, the ninth day of July, 2008.
[00:30.000 --> 00:35.000]  I talked to Governor Ventura from his home this morning.
[00:35.000 --> 00:39.000]  I'll be telling you about that conversation coming up in the next segment.
[00:39.000 --> 00:48.000]  It concerns a fraudulent report by ABC News saying that he had announced for the U.S. Senate.
[00:48.000 --> 00:58.000]  Though I will tell you that it was lined up to have him either way announce that next Tuesday will be the date.
[00:58.000 --> 01:00.000]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:00.000 --> 01:03.000]  But we'll tell a little bit more about this controversy.
[01:03.000 --> 01:11.000]  It's very important on the other side, just as an educational example of the dirty tricks that the establishment plays
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.000]  and all the more reason he needs to run, showing that they are concerned about him.
[01:16.000 --> 01:24.000]  Pat Carmack, the maker of the Money Masters, amazing three-hour-plus film available at infowars.com,
[01:24.000 --> 01:30.000]  about the history of the private banking cartel that owns and runs our society.
[01:30.000 --> 01:38.000]  And they're now fully imploding the currency and the economy so they can have a criminal consolidation.
[01:38.000 --> 01:46.000]  They will be joining us, both Pat Carmack and the narrator, for an hour and a half at noon central time today.
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  Then for 30 minutes, Steve Watson, he was taken in by the anti-terror police.
[01:51.000 --> 01:56.000]  And as millions of Britons are now, it's all part of the new secret policing system.
[01:56.000 --> 02:00.000]  We don't have to talk about this happening to others. This has happened to me. It's happened to Steve.
[02:00.000 --> 02:02.000]  It's happening to many others.
[02:02.000 --> 02:11.000]  And then Ralph Winterwood, a very interesting fellow who's really done some great research into these private mercenary agencies of government,
[02:11.000 --> 02:19.000]  he'll be joining us for his maiden voyage with us the first time he'll be on with us, coming up in the fourth hour today.
[02:19.000 --> 02:25.000]  This will also be the first time that we have had the makers of the Money Masters,
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.000]  the preeminent film on the Federal Reserve crime syndicate.
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.000]  Very well done. I remember that sucker was out in 1998.
[02:32.000 --> 02:36.000]  Remember putting it on access television, airing it over and over again.
[02:36.000 --> 02:42.000]  That was the four hour version. It's been cut down to about three and a half hours. That's on one DVD again.
[02:42.000 --> 02:49.000]  And even if you know all about it, your neighbors, friends, and family don't get the 1995 film at infowars.com.
[02:49.000 --> 02:55.000]  But Pat Carmack and others joining us. Okay, huge news today.
[02:55.000 --> 03:01.000]  Really important information that we are going to be going over and covering.
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.000]  There is so much of it that we'll be covering after the break.
[03:05.000 --> 03:11.000]  This radio show today is shaping up for one of those that nobody wants to miss,
[03:11.000 --> 03:17.000]  because the information that is going to be conveyed and covered and relayed in the next four hours,
[03:17.000 --> 03:19.000]  here's some of the news coming up.
[03:19.000 --> 03:23.000]  Ventura ABC Senate Report run a lie flat out misrepresentation.
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.000]  He told me that just about an hour and a half ago.
[03:27.000 --> 03:32.000]  Also, the disinfo piece itself from ABC News, Jesse Ventura to run for Senate.
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.000]  Oil rebounds on Iranian missile launch.
[03:36.000 --> 03:42.000]  California town creates parking havens for the growing number of homeless Americans living in their cars.
[03:42.000 --> 03:48.000]  Russia warns U.S. over check missile shield, warns military action against U.S.
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.000]  Terror stop for putting my hand in my pocket, Steve Watson.
[03:52.000 --> 04:00.000]  Toddlers who do dislike spicy food are racist and are being recorded in the racist terror file.
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  This is London Telegraph. You can't make this up. We are all hardcore crooks now.
[04:04.000 --> 04:09.000]  You're going to spend hardcore time in forced labor camps, ladies and gentlemen, for any reason at all.
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.000]  And if you don't like it, the SWAT teams will gun you down in a pile of bloody heap.
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.000]  You think I'm joking? This is the hell force that's being released on us.
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.000]  Higher CO2 levels may be good for plants German scientists report.
[04:23.000 --> 04:31.000]  This is out of the Associated Press and the French news agencies also reporting on it.
[04:31.000 --> 04:41.000]  This revelation is like saying animals may thrive on oxygen or fish may like to live in water.
[04:41.000 --> 04:49.000]  But it's a big announcement. CO2 may be good. No.
[04:49.000 --> 05:01.000]  We'll be right back.
[05:21.000 --> 05:25.000]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings,

[06:08.000 --> 06:11.000]  for American people and farmers but legal to import.
[06:11.000 --> 06:14.000]  The founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.

[07:52.000 --> 08:07.000]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:07.000 --> 08:14.000]  About six months ago, we wrote stories at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com,
[08:14.000 --> 08:20.000]  breaking the news at Homeland Security in their own public reports
[08:20.000 --> 08:26.000]  that Congress was considering and looking at technologies to have us all wear taser bracelets.
[08:26.000 --> 08:31.000]  This is the new, I mean, that's worse than 1984, worse than Brave New World.
[08:31.000 --> 08:34.000]  I mean, only the prisoners wore those in the running man.
[08:34.000 --> 08:41.000]  We would all wear them when getting on airplanes. All guilty until proven innocent.
[08:41.000 --> 08:46.000]  And then the debate within Homeland Security would be would terrorists be able to take the bracelets off instead of
[08:46.000 --> 08:50.000]  what type of society is this? Can you trust the government to do that?
[08:50.000 --> 08:55.000]  I mean, how obviously corrupt is this? How ridiculous the government that would push this?
[08:55.000 --> 08:58.000]  They're the threat. And people didn't believe it.
[08:58.000 --> 09:01.000]  They didn't believe it when we posted the company out of Canada pushing it
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.000]  with their little presentation video. They didn't believe it when we posted the Homeland Security links.
[09:06.000 --> 09:12.000]  It's in the Washington Post yesterday. The Washington Post is reporting on it and talking about it
[09:12.000 --> 09:17.000]  and basically copying articles that we wrote and others wrote about it.
[09:17.000 --> 09:22.000]  I mean, it's an anti-Taser bracelet story.
[09:22.000 --> 09:25.000]  I mean, I guess the establishment thinks it's not quite time in the Washington Post
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.000]  to tell us how great it is. They're just introducing it to us.
[09:28.000 --> 09:32.000]  Kind of like the Washington Post six years ago, I had the writer on for Wash Tech,
[09:32.000 --> 09:38.000]  their technology section, saying, yes, I've been to technology consortium meetings
[09:38.000 --> 09:45.000]  where they say that they're promoting the body modification and piercing community
[09:45.000 --> 09:51.000]  in television and movies to prepare the public for microchip implantation.
[09:51.000 --> 09:56.000]  Of course, Aaron Russo said that he met with Nick Rockefeller and he said the same thing.
[09:56.000 --> 10:02.000]  And then now you see the Washington Post and others reporting that it's great to have implantable chips.
[10:02.000 --> 10:06.000]  So, I mean, this is a massive concerted effort to condition you.
[10:06.000 --> 10:11.000]  And then we got Army reports saying they were using the media to condition you to prepare the public
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.000]  for implantation of chips to control you. That's a public Army report.
[10:16.000 --> 10:24.000]  Army War College declassified in January 7th, 2000 by the Federation of American Scientists.
[10:24.000 --> 10:29.000]  This is not Alex Jones saying this. This is really what they plan to do.
[10:29.000 --> 10:34.000]  And now you hear England announcing two weeks ago BBC reporting saying it's wonderful
[10:34.000 --> 10:40.000]  that they want to make all prisoners take implantable chips and then all parolees, you see.
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.000]  England's always on the cutting edge of everything tyrannical.
[10:44.000 --> 10:50.000]  So, we're here. It's happening.
[10:50.000 --> 10:58.000]  And all of this integrates in to the basic fact that the U.S., the British, and other Western governments
[10:58.000 --> 11:04.000]  from the 40s through to today release lethal chemical and biologicals on a routine basis
[11:04.000 --> 11:08.000]  in small towns and big cities, killing groups of Americans and others,
[11:08.000 --> 11:15.000]  and then having military doctors in place at local hospitals under grants to quietly cover up the deaths
[11:15.000 --> 11:18.000]  and then to file reports which are then later even declassified.
[11:18.000 --> 11:21.000]  They murdered us at will. They murdered us continually.
[11:21.000 --> 11:26.000]  They write books calling the military and police dumb animals that follow our orders.
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.000]  They're laughing at you, police and military. They nerve gas military.
[11:30.000 --> 11:36.000]  They test biologicals on police. We believe they did that eight years ago at the DPS headquarters.
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.000]  A bunch of people got sick there. We know they were running a test at the time.
[11:39.000 --> 11:45.000]  Do you like being sprayed by your masters? I mean, we know they're doing this.
[11:45.000 --> 11:49.000]  Just like yesterday, I played a clip mainstream news about it.
[11:49.000 --> 11:54.000]  This is happening. They are poisoning the food. They are poisoning the water.
[11:54.000 --> 12:02.000]  You are under eugenics attack. The question is, will you stop denying it and at least look at the claims I just made?
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.000]  I mean, if there's a 1% chance what I just said is true, you better look into it now.
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.000]  Well, it's 100%. It's absolutely documented.
[12:09.000 --> 12:16.000]  And you take my challenge, police officers listening right now, you go look into it and you find out if they're doing this.
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.000]  And then you ask yourselves, why are they doing it?
[12:19.000 --> 12:30.000]  It is to create cadres of hundreds of thousands of internal enforcers who, if they'll even spray their own police and if they'll even spray their own military,
[12:30.000 --> 12:36.000]  then they will certainly do it to the population. This is a test to create cold-blooded automatons.
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.000]  Here's an example. It's in mainstream news yesterday.
[12:40.000 --> 12:51.000]  They have the citizen, you know, quote, auxiliary police who were unarmed all over England and they have been ordered to fresk everybody,
[12:51.000 --> 12:58.000]  search everybody, randomly line people up and question them to get them into files, into databases.
[12:58.000 --> 13:06.000]  And they've been ordered not to help grounding people, so when they see kids grounding in the river, in the Thames, they don't help them.
[13:06.000 --> 13:13.000]  And they stand by and watch a small child right there on the edge of the water, drowned, saying, we have orders not to help.
[13:13.000 --> 13:22.000]  See, I mean, it's total automaton. They are, they're not even evil. They are, it's all robotic training.
[13:22.000 --> 13:30.000]  Everything is robotic training, just like it's robotic training for a helicopter pilot to fly over U.S. troops in a field.
[13:30.000 --> 13:38.000]  He doesn't ask what's in the tank. He robotically follows orders. He sprays it. The men collapse and die.
[13:38.000 --> 13:45.000]  And then other military comes and picks up the dead bodies and then they're told, this is classified. You don't talk about this.
[13:45.000 --> 13:50.000]  And then they've, they bring in the men in a month later. They brief them. What's your feelings on this?
[13:50.000 --> 13:56.000]  What do you think about it? Those that say, well, it looks like a test we need to do. I know they died, but, you know, this is just, we've got to do this.
[13:56.000 --> 14:02.000]  Know what the enemy's going to do? They say, that's it. You're going straight up to command level. You're going to be running entire ops.
[14:02.000 --> 14:09.000]  Boom. Houses in Maui, millions of dollars. Next, you're dealing narcotics. Next, you're running hit squads.
[14:09.000 --> 14:19.000]  Next, you're put into the black op government because you would openly take part in murdering your own people, your own police officers, your own military people.
[14:19.000 --> 14:35.000]  You go right to the top. You understand how this works. And so there's a cadre now of at least 200 plus thousand military police, government, company executives, all in this criminal network.
[14:35.000 --> 14:59.000]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, do you know the hardcore will, the, the, I mean, the dark power, I mean, the dark will to take a two year old child, a healthy, happy baby and put him in a radiation chamber in New Mexico or Arizona or Texas or New York and to flip the switch and hit him with so much radiation, they die an hour later.
[14:59.000 --> 15:21.000]  I mean, to take a little baby, a little toddler and to murder them. Your government did that more than 4,000 times in in game. We have the atomic energy agencies own admissions a link to their page where they disclose it all.
[15:21.000 --> 15:31.000]  Murdering children. And again, it's like you train a dog. They first said, we're going to radiate a terminally ill retarded child.
[15:31.000 --> 15:53.000]  And well, it's sad, but we got to test what radiation does. And it's, well, this child is a little brain damaged. All right, then all right, now we're going to kill 4,000 healthy children, get ready, got to test what happens with healthy ones. These children were taken from their parents, their parents are, you know, white trash single parent.
[15:53.000 --> 16:15.000]  See, that's the eugenics idea, just like they had the head of the Psychiatry Association in Texas last year. It's an in game before the state legislature and Susanna Hupp, Representative Susanna Hupp says, well, why are 67% of the children on psychotropic drugs?
[16:15.000 --> 16:30.000]  And he said, well, they have a bad gene pool, they have bad genes, we have to do that. Of course, that's all quackery, but even if you believe it's bad genes, they don't test, they don't look, they don't just, well, the bad genes is evident by the fact that we see PS their children.
[16:30.000 --> 16:42.000]  And so we give them drugs that then result in all sorts of mental problems and health problems. And the average child, of course, that they have on those drugs is on seven.
[16:42.000 --> 16:55.000]  I mean, I've seen it in mainstream news reports where they put a kid's healthy and happy, get CPS or gets in trouble or goes and has a BB gun fight with a neighbor kid and the police arrest them, something most of us did.
[16:55.000 --> 17:07.000]  And then four years later, they're in a coffin because they put them on 14 drugs. And then they were having seizures on sevens, they put them on seven more than they just die.
[17:07.000 --> 17:27.000]  And they're dying all around you, they're dying. And then they take children and they test pesticides on them till they die. And they even put it in the mainstream papers and report, well, should they be, should they have taken eight-year-old Gregory from his mother, healthy black boy and fed him pesticide till he died?
[17:27.000 --> 17:38.000]  The first few days of the facility, Gregory was walking around and happy and doing well. But as they tested the pesticide on him at the private facility, he was then in the bed and poor Gregory tried to escape, so they strapped him down.
[17:38.000 --> 17:46.000]  And then, you know, after a month of having an administered young Gregory died, is that good?
[17:46.000 --> 18:04.000]  Kind of like, you know, we play the Australian piece about the U.S. government asked the Australians to nerve gas with lethal nerve gas 200 of their troops. Is that good? We played that news case. Is that a good thing? See, just oh, they just nerve gas troops and want to kill them?
[18:04.000 --> 18:12.000]  I mean, is that okay? I mean, is that illegal?
[18:12.000 --> 18:24.000]  I'm going to tell you again, military and police, your masters, those that make you think you have authority and you're the good guys and you're doing it all for a good reason and you're going to take blood from us at checkpoints.
[18:24.000 --> 18:34.000]  You're being trained to perform medical procedures. You'll see them the next year or two now after this federal grant announced. Well, since you've already been doing that, now you're going to do forced inoculations.
[18:34.000 --> 18:45.000]  You know, our officers have already taken blood. You see, it's a path to hell. It's increments.
[18:45.000 --> 18:56.000]  And now, toddlers who dislike spicy food are racist. It is a government group, watchdog group, funded about $24 million or 12 million pounds a year.
[18:56.000 --> 19:14.000]  And they are telling all the government toddler preschools and private ones under law that if a child doesn't like food, they are to be put in a racist database and to be turned over to police because not liking a spicy food, what child does?
[19:14.000 --> 19:21.000]  I mean, let me give you a newsflash. Children don't like spicy food in Thailand. They don't feed them that until they're about three.
[19:21.000 --> 19:28.000]  But, I mean, you're saying that sounds crazy. It's meant to be crazy. Behavioral psychologists came up with this to where it's all so nuts what the government's doing.
[19:28.000 --> 19:39.000]  You just kind of have your mouth hanging open. Two-year-olds are being put in criminal databases. If their parents have a criminal record, they're saying it's their genetics.
[19:39.000 --> 19:47.000]  I mean, this is a reign of terror that is upon us. We'll cover this when we get back, then get into the Jesse Ventura news I talked to him this morning and a lot more.
[19:47.000 --> 19:53.000]  Tons of key info. Very important to stay with us. prisonplanet.com is the website.
[20:17.000 --> 20:39.000]  For the report, the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[20:52.000 --> 20:59.000]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-Eleven was an inside job.
[20:59.000 --> 21:02.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[21:02.000 --> 21:09.000]  How do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a stage? Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, that's for a lateral commission, the CFR?
[21:09.000 --> 21:18.000]  We said I'm shadowing. The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[21:18.000 --> 21:24.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.000]  An inside job? How dare you?
[21:31.000 --> 21:35.000]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[21:35.000 --> 21:43.000]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue. And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-Eleven.

[24:06.000 --> 24:30.000]  Front porch sitting in an old rocking chair. The sun is hot in the Texas sky. Garden growing, clothes out on a line. A dusty road when a car goes by.
[24:30.000 --> 24:48.000]  Story fell out a days long ago. And the only place she'd ever been. Singing softly, this world is not my home.
[24:48.000 --> 25:12.000]  And memories take me back again. When I was young, and grandma wasn't old. What she guided me is I want to live on full. Anything we didn't have, we didn't really need to hold.
[25:12.000 --> 25:37.000]  When I was young, and grandma wasn't old.
[25:37.000 --> 25:57.000]  Now, if our criminal government, the black op government that took over completely in 1947 of the National Security Act, and began immediately killing its own military, its own citizens spring towns with chemicals, biologicals, radiologicals, and then practicing the cover-up in the news media,
[25:57.000 --> 26:10.000]  practice the co-opting in the local and stabular, that's what it's all about. Why do they want to do that? To build an evil force in government, a secret force that would do anything. And then decades later, it's declassified in our face.
[26:10.000 --> 26:20.000]  People say, well, why do they do that? It's just part of the throwing in your face, part of the conditioning. Regardless of why they do it, they do it and they admit it.
[26:20.000 --> 26:39.000]  And so if they would take more than 4,000, this is what they admit, children and murder them with radiation in the U.S. and pay Israel to radiate 110,000 children, all declassified, all public, then why wouldn't they kill 3,000 of us on 9-11?
[26:39.000 --> 26:53.000]  Stop being chumps. Stop being in denial. This is life and death. I'm a very serious person in my private life. Years ago, I screwed around, joked a lot, was really a lot more happy.
[26:53.000 --> 27:05.000]  But every day, every moment, every time I catch myself distracted by a good novel or by some entertainment movie I want to see or going out with friends and eating a good dinner, maybe drinking a beer, don't do that anymore.
[27:05.000 --> 27:12.000]  You know why? Because I know, folks, that I've got a total responsibility to warn you. Do I do the best job of it? Probably not.
[27:12.000 --> 27:23.000]  The point is, I mean, we got psychos running things. They're killing us. It's absolutely admitted. They carried out 9-11. This is surely as they radiated those children and admit they did.
[27:23.000 --> 27:40.000]  And I know I'm talking more and more about this because it's just more and more, I realize, when you try to convince somebody about 9-11, when I was on the BBC and they had 5-1 on live international BBC radio, the main BBC, 5-1 against me worldwide,
[27:40.000 --> 27:48.000]  tens of millions of listeners, conservatively, 5-1. I knew I had to hit them fast and I came right out with it. You can hear the audio online.
[27:48.000 --> 27:55.000]  And I said, first off, I just want to say it's declassified. Our government staged a Gulf of Tonkin attack, staged a U.S. Liberty attack, now admitted.
[27:55.000 --> 28:10.000]  Planned other attacks like Operation Northwoods, Operation Ajax and Iran. Our government staged terror attacks. And then I tried to come out with the second volley of, and they did the Tuskegee experiment with syphilis and black men and they radiated children
[28:10.000 --> 28:18.000]  and they're still doing it right now and they sterilized 500,000 in the U.S. alone that we know of and eugenics, but they cut me off.
[28:18.000 --> 28:25.000]  But still, they then had a debate about that and they had to admit, okay, what he said was true, but they didn't carry out the big terror attack.
[28:25.000 --> 28:35.000]  And I had them. I defeated them all right there. It was like in a boxing match. I came right out, 5-1, and I hit the biggest one right square in the nose and broke their nose in the debate and they fell over.
[28:35.000 --> 28:45.000]  It didn't matter if they piled on with as much disinfo as they wanted. The fact is the criminals that run our government have done this stuff over and over again.
[28:45.000 --> 28:57.000]  You understand that if I wasn't as prominent as I am, my life wouldn't be worth one red cent. You think I enjoy the fact that I have gone head up against psycho killers that have killed hundreds of millions last century
[28:57.000 --> 29:07.000]  and have already killed tens of millions this century in the last eight years worldwide with eugenics operations and wars and starvation. We have their own State Department plan to do it.
[29:07.000 --> 29:19.000]  You think I like that. You think it's some macho thrill. It makes my blood flow like ice water, but I am committed to defend the weak.
[29:19.000 --> 29:35.000]  I am committed to face the truth no matter how horrible it is and make provisions for it. And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what overrides that cold ice water feeling is the fiery passion and love I have for my fellow man.
[29:35.000 --> 29:42.000]  My love of all your innocence and all your decency, I will defend you. I will stand for you.

[34:03.000 --> 34:06.000]  Thunder and lightning in her thighs.
[34:06.000 --> 34:17.000]  Alright, we are back live, ladies and gentlemen. And I want to play a song for you. Top ranking by Bob Marley here in just a moment when I want to get back out of the news.
[34:17.000 --> 34:27.000]  All of us, you know, have differences. I mean, I'm different from Bob Marley. He was had a black mama and a white daddy.
[34:27.000 --> 34:40.000]  His daddy was a captain in the British Royal Marines. His mama was a 4-18-year-old girl on a sugarcane plantation that always asked Bob Marley what color are you.
[34:40.000 --> 34:51.000]  And he said, well, I'm on the white side of the black side. I'm on God's side. The individual, the entity that decided that I'd be black and white.
[34:51.000 --> 35:02.000]  And he talks about top ranking. People love to fight with each other and sometimes you can't resist. I mean, I love Hispanic people.
[35:02.000 --> 35:08.000]  I like a lot of things about their culture. I'm not individually against them wanting a better life.
[35:08.000 --> 35:14.000]  But I understand they've been brainwashed and told the US belongs to them and it needs to be brought down. That is the illegal aliens.
[35:14.000 --> 35:22.000]  And our own government's funded for 60-plus years to make sure that they've been taught that and the general public's not aware of it.
[35:22.000 --> 35:30.000]  And all I know is the globalists want to bring down this country and they're helping use third world labor and third world balkanization to do it.
[35:30.000 --> 35:40.000]  So I'm against the open borders. But that's not because I'm against the illegal aliens, even though I know that they think I'm the evil gringo, many of them.
[35:40.000 --> 35:48.000]  But it doesn't mean that I then still don't fight against the policy which the New World orders for. Because anything the New World orders for, I'm against.
[35:48.000 --> 35:57.000]  I can even in an unintellectual level just know anything there for must be bad and then I can intellectually track back that yes, that decision is correct.
[35:57.000 --> 36:05.000]  What does that mean? I'm against the poor, desperate people in Mexico where all the toxic waste of the United States, much of it's being dumped.
[36:05.000 --> 36:15.000]  We're upwards of one-third of their children are born in Mexico City without a brain. There's a syndrome where it's about a tenth the size and basically they're just born as complete vegetables and comas.
[36:15.000 --> 36:30.000]  It's horrible. I want that to stop. But that won't stop. We'll just have a fake carbon tax on carbon dioxide while the real toxic waste and genetic engineering and all the true crises and deforestation accelerates.
[36:30.000 --> 36:45.000]  Do I want to shut down all the death mills, killing blacks, killing Hispanics, killing whites, the Planned Parenthood facilities, calling people of color, subhuman trash, weeds that need to be exterminated?
[36:45.000 --> 36:55.000]  Do I get angry at the pimp leaders of the blacks and the Hispanics and the whites who will never tell their people the truth?
[36:55.000 --> 37:15.000]  Yes. Do I get frustrated when I know who the real enemy is, the tiny cabal of a less than 2,000 globalist and their cadres of only a few hundred thousand enforcers who are carrying out this merciless attack on humanity?
[37:15.000 --> 37:26.000]  Does it make me mad when I reach out and try to expose how they cherry pick the black community for their most vicious biological and chemical and radiological test currently going on?
[37:26.000 --> 37:36.000]  And then some black supremacist individual puts a YouTube video out saying I'm a white devil and I'm a demon and nothing good can come from a white person.
[37:36.000 --> 37:51.000]  Do I realize how mindless and wicked that is and how blinded that person is spiritually, mentally, intellectually? Yes. But I still don't hate black people because some black people hate my guts because I happen to be from northern Europe.
[37:51.000 --> 37:54.000]  Predominantly, I've got some Native American.
[37:54.000 --> 38:06.000]  I realize we're all human beings and I realize if they're murdering black children in New York or in Angola that my children aren't safe at an instinctive level. I mean, emotionally, I'm upset by it.
[38:06.000 --> 38:16.000]  But I can analyze my programming, my basic makeup and understand why it's there because what comes around goes around, you reap what you sow.
[38:16.000 --> 38:30.000]  You know, they want us all fussing and fighting with each other. They want us attacking each other. They want us to debate, you know, within our own movement against tyranny in the New World Order to spend all our time fighting with each other like at some type of popularity contest.
[38:30.000 --> 38:39.000]  It isn't. This is a pitch battle, life and death. I'm in the ditch on the front lines, swinging my musket against the New World Order and you're not helping me a lot of you.
[38:39.000 --> 38:50.000]  You're busy back, armchair quarter backing, critiquing everybody else, debating all day exactly who's at the top of the pyramid while we are under chemical and biological red level attack.
[38:50.000 --> 39:02.000]  The number one thing you need to educate people about is government sponsored terror and the tens of thousands of declassified examples of how they're murdering all of us no matter what color you are, we're all under soft kill attack.
[39:02.000 --> 39:12.000]  And if you don't know what a soft kill weapon is, brothers, you better find out, brothers and sisters, I don't care what color you are.
[39:12.000 --> 39:30.000]  I'm not dedicating my life and putting myself in the way of the New World Order fist for nothing. I am doing it because my humanity cries out against what's happening and it's time to unify against the New World Order and direct all of our energies against them.
[39:30.000 --> 39:49.000]  This song is for all of you out there, all of you to get refocused on the prize of exposing world government, exposing their program, exposing that government, local, state and federal is the engine, the mechanism, the drill bit they use to attack you and your family
[39:49.000 --> 40:00.000]  and that it must be hacked back and reduced in size and that it must be fully discredited or it will now carry out its great work which is the extermination of 80 to 90 percent of us.
[40:00.000 --> 40:06.000]  You think it's going to be bad war and depression? That's nothing compared to the next phases that come after that.
[40:06.000 --> 40:14.000]  The nerve gassing, the biological attacks, always, you know, your flat screen TV is telling you it's a man with a beard that did it with a turban.
[40:14.000 --> 40:26.000]  So you clutch to the knee of the black ski mask cop who himself is under attack but thinks he's working for a system that's defending you or it's really a system that's killing him and you.
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.000]  So here it is, Bob Marley's Top Rankin'.
[40:30.000 --> 40:48.000]  They don't want to see us unite. What they want us to do is keep on forcing us by today.
[40:48.000 --> 41:02.000]  They don't want to see us live together. What they want us to do is keep on killing one another.
[41:02.000 --> 41:22.000]  Top Rankin', Top Rankin', for you skankin', for you skankin', for you skankin', for you Top Rankin', oh did you mean what you said?
[41:22.000 --> 41:33.000]  For you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you.
[41:33.000 --> 41:43.000]  They say the blood runs and it runs through our lion and the heart, or the heart of man.
[41:43.000 --> 41:58.000]  And John saw them come, or with the truth come an ancient term.
[41:58.000 --> 42:16.000]  The brotherly love, the sisterly love, sisterly love. I feel this morning, I feel this morning, brotherly love, brotherly love.
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.400]  The sisterly love, sisterly love
[42:19.400 --> 42:21.400]  I feel it's a border
[42:21.400 --> 42:23.400]  For all of you right now
[42:23.400 --> 42:25.400]  This morning
[42:25.400 --> 42:27.400]  We're together
[42:27.400 --> 42:30.400]  They don't want us to
[42:30.400 --> 42:32.400]  Unite
[42:32.400 --> 42:34.400]  Unite
[42:34.400 --> 42:38.400]  All they want us to do is
[42:38.400 --> 42:42.400]  Keep on fucking and fighting
[42:42.400 --> 42:44.400]  They don't want to see us
[42:44.400 --> 42:46.400]  Live together
[42:49.800 --> 42:52.800]  All they want us to do is
[42:52.800 --> 42:55.800]  Keep on killing one another
[42:55.800 --> 42:57.800]  Top racket
[42:57.800 --> 42:59.800]  Top racket
[42:59.800 --> 43:01.800]  Did you mean what you said?
[43:01.800 --> 43:02.800]  Top racket
[43:02.800 --> 43:04.800]  Are you skankin?
[43:04.800 --> 43:06.800]  Skankin, skankin
[43:06.800 --> 43:08.800]  Are you skankin?
[43:08.800 --> 43:10.800]  Skankin, skankin
[43:10.800 --> 43:12.800]  Top racket
[43:12.800 --> 43:14.800]  Did you mean what you said?
[43:14.800 --> 43:16.800]  Top racket
[43:16.800 --> 43:18.800]  Are you skankin?
[43:18.800 --> 43:20.800]  Are you skankin?
[43:20.800 --> 43:22.800]  Skankin, skankin
[43:22.800 --> 43:24.800]  Top racket
[43:24.800 --> 43:26.800]  Top racket
[43:26.800 --> 43:28.800]  Top racket
[43:28.800 --> 43:30.800]  Top racket
[43:30.800 --> 43:50.800]  Are you skankin?
[44:32.800 --> 44:34.800]  I was just reading his report last night
[44:34.800 --> 44:36.800]  With the numbers of dead and dying from it
[44:36.800 --> 44:40.800]  It is incredibly cold blooded what the elite are doing
[44:40.800 --> 44:42.800]  What the globalists are doing to us
[44:44.800 --> 44:46.800]  And it's time to come together
[44:46.800 --> 44:48.800]  It's time to
[44:48.800 --> 44:50.800]  Focus on the issues that really matter
[44:50.800 --> 44:52.800]  And not let the co-and-tell pro-operations
[44:52.800 --> 44:54.800]  The new old order get us in fighting with each other
[44:54.800 --> 44:56.800]  I'll say this, it's its human nature
[44:56.800 --> 44:58.800]  Our society is degenerating
[44:58.800 --> 45:00.800]  We all know that
[45:00.800 --> 45:02.800]  I have been betrayed and backstabbed by so many people
[45:02.800 --> 45:04.800]  I've tried to give a hand up in this movement
[45:04.800 --> 45:08.800]  Others have delusionally believed I've done things to them
[45:08.800 --> 45:10.800]  And I just say a lot of times
[45:10.800 --> 45:12.800]  I have hate for those people and dislike
[45:12.800 --> 45:14.800]  I'm going to bury the hatchet
[45:14.800 --> 45:16.800]  That doesn't mean I'll associate with any of them
[45:16.800 --> 45:18.800]  But I'm not going to
[45:18.800 --> 45:20.800]  I'm not going to hate them at a spiritual level
[45:20.800 --> 45:22.800]  Or a mental level
[45:22.800 --> 45:26.800]  And I'm just going to turn the other cheek yet again
[45:26.800 --> 45:28.800]  To everybody
[45:28.800 --> 45:30.800]  Because folks
[45:32.800 --> 45:34.800]  I am so frustrated and upset
[45:34.800 --> 45:36.800]  By all the deceived people I see in our movement
[45:36.800 --> 45:38.800]  Who spend their time spinning their wheels
[45:38.800 --> 45:40.800]  Going down rabbit trails that don't matter
[45:40.800 --> 45:42.800]  All I want to do
[45:42.800 --> 45:44.800]  Is to get you to be the leaders you are
[45:44.800 --> 45:46.800]  And to reach out to others
[45:46.800 --> 45:48.800]  And to reach out to them
[45:48.800 --> 45:50.800]  And expose them to the reality
[45:50.800 --> 45:52.800]  Of what is coming down
[45:52.800 --> 45:54.800]  The holocaust
[45:54.800 --> 45:56.800]  The annihilation
[45:56.800 --> 45:58.800]  The desolation that is happening on so many fronts
[45:58.800 --> 46:00.800]  The intensification
[46:00.800 --> 46:02.800]  Of the New World Order plan
[46:02.800 --> 46:04.800]  To turn this world into hell
[46:04.800 --> 46:06.800]  Which they think is a heaven
[46:08.800 --> 46:10.800]  I don't know what you call
[46:10.800 --> 46:12.800]  Hundreds of thousands of art-owned troops
[46:12.800 --> 46:14.800]  You may dehumanize the Iraqis and not care about them
[46:14.800 --> 46:16.800]  Nobody cares when they kill Iraqi kids on tape
[46:16.800 --> 46:18.800]  And they care if they kill a dog
[46:18.800 --> 46:20.800]  Well, you better care about our own troops
[46:20.800 --> 46:22.800]  I mean, I watch the Senate hearings
[46:22.800 --> 46:24.800]  As the people are in the wheelchairs dying
[46:24.800 --> 46:26.800]  And then you hear a week later they've died
[46:26.800 --> 46:28.800]  I read the reports
[46:28.800 --> 46:30.800]  I get the calls
[46:30.800 --> 46:32.800]  I get mailed medical reports
[46:32.800 --> 46:34.800]  Where they say absolutely
[46:34.800 --> 46:36.800]  To put your radiums destroyed your lungs
[46:36.800 --> 46:38.800]  Or dying of cancer
[46:38.800 --> 46:40.800]  And then they go to the VA and the VA says
[46:40.800 --> 46:42.800]  We're not going to look at that other medical report
[46:42.800 --> 46:44.800]  You're not going to get any care
[46:44.800 --> 46:46.800]  Just go die
[46:46.800 --> 46:48.800]  Meanwhile
[46:48.800 --> 46:50.800]  In another area of society
[46:50.800 --> 46:52.800]  They're saying that when a Muslim's
[46:52.800 --> 46:54.800]  Having their house searched in England
[46:54.800 --> 46:56.800]  The dog will wear booties
[46:56.800 --> 46:58.800]  Little footies, little shoes
[46:58.800 --> 47:00.800]  So that the dirty devil dog
[47:00.800 --> 47:02.800]  Doesn't get any of its evil in their home
[47:02.800 --> 47:04.800]  See, that's how the globalists operate
[47:04.800 --> 47:06.800]  They will do something silly
[47:06.800 --> 47:08.800]  That makes everybody think
[47:08.800 --> 47:10.800]  Oh, they're rolling a red carpet out for the Muslims
[47:10.800 --> 47:12.800]  But then they'll arrest Muslims
[47:12.800 --> 47:14.800]  And citizens
[47:14.800 --> 47:16.800]  And Christians, it doesn't matter
[47:16.800 --> 47:18.800]  What they do with them
[47:18.800 --> 47:20.800]  With no warrant, torture them
[47:20.800 --> 47:22.800]  Fly them out of the country for torture
[47:22.800 --> 47:24.800]  Even if they're a citizen
[47:24.800 --> 47:26.800]  So they'll take their basic rights
[47:26.800 --> 47:28.800]  But then give them ridiculous ones that don't exist
[47:28.800 --> 47:30.800]  Just to make it look silly and stupid
[47:32.800 --> 47:34.800]  See how they operate
[47:34.800 --> 47:36.800]  The games they play
[47:36.800 --> 47:38.800]  Here's an article, London Telegraph
[47:38.800 --> 47:40.800]  And you can go to the government report on this
[47:40.800 --> 47:42.800]  Toddlers who dislike spicy food
[47:42.800 --> 47:44.800]  Racist
[47:44.800 --> 47:46.800]  And they're put in racism databases
[47:46.800 --> 47:48.800]  For life at age two to three
[47:48.800 --> 47:50.800]  If they, and they give them hot sauce
[47:50.800 --> 47:52.800]  And of course any child
[47:52.800 --> 47:54.800]  Would not like hot sauce
[47:54.800 --> 47:56.800]  But see, that's how I thought crime
[47:56.800 --> 47:58.800]  You won't know what life's going to be like very soon
[47:58.800 --> 48:00.800]  Look what it's like for children
[48:00.800 --> 48:02.800]  You draw a picture, they say draw a picture
[48:02.800 --> 48:04.800]  Of your father or your mother
[48:04.800 --> 48:06.800]  For career day, you draw a picture of your dad
[48:06.800 --> 48:08.800]  Who's a marine corps major
[48:08.800 --> 48:10.800]  You're arrested
[48:10.800 --> 48:12.800]  Because there's a sidearm on him
[48:12.800 --> 48:14.800]  That's a real case
[48:14.800 --> 48:16.800]  You're valovictorian, it's the last day of school
[48:16.800 --> 48:18.800]  You brought a cake to your teacher
[48:18.800 --> 48:20.800]  Because you're the teacher's pet
[48:20.800 --> 48:22.800]  To have a little party after school
[48:22.800 --> 48:24.800]  Security guard sees a plastic box
[48:24.800 --> 48:26.800]  Of Dixie knives, forks and spoons
[48:26.800 --> 48:28.800]  You're arrested, you're stripped of your diploma
[48:28.800 --> 48:30.800]  Real case
[48:30.800 --> 48:32.800]  See, it's about mindless zero-tolerance
[48:32.800 --> 48:34.800]  Enforcement
[48:34.800 --> 48:36.800]  Like, oh, the auxiliary police in England
[48:36.800 --> 48:38.800]  Are not supposed to help someone drowning
[48:38.800 --> 48:40.800]  They are told to call a official officer
[48:40.800 --> 48:42.800]  So the small child in three feet of water is drowning
[48:42.800 --> 48:44.800]  You don't help them
[48:44.800 --> 48:46.800]  The older brother goes in
[48:46.800 --> 48:48.800]  Against drowning to get the child
[48:48.800 --> 48:50.800]  You don't help them, you watch them die
[48:50.800 --> 48:52.800]  And you are promoted
[48:52.800 --> 48:54.800]  For mindless
[48:54.800 --> 48:56.800]  Robotic
[48:56.800 --> 48:58.800]  That's what they want from you
[49:00.800 --> 49:02.800]  And so they say to the government
[49:02.800 --> 49:04.800]  Funded, they call it smart start
[49:04.800 --> 49:06.800]  In England, it's all under the same program
[49:06.800 --> 49:08.800]  It's all systematic everywhere, all the programs run by the same people
[49:08.800 --> 49:10.800]  Doesn't matter what nation
[49:10.800 --> 49:12.800]  If the child is
[49:12.800 --> 49:14.800]  To be fed to teach them not to be racist
[49:14.800 --> 49:16.800]  Because eating
[49:16.800 --> 49:18.800]  Jolapenias, eating curry
[49:18.800 --> 49:20.800]  It lists those
[49:20.800 --> 49:22.800]  If you don't like jolapenias when you're three
[49:22.800 --> 49:24.800]  Whose taste buds are ready
[49:24.800 --> 49:26.800]  Mexican children here in Texas
[49:26.800 --> 49:28.800]  Don't eat jolapenias at three
[49:28.800 --> 49:30.800]  I didn't start eating until I was about four
[49:30.800 --> 49:32.800]  I love them now, just gobble them
[49:32.800 --> 49:34.800]  But the point is, is that
[49:34.800 --> 49:36.800]  The child doesn't even know what the concept of racism is
[49:36.800 --> 49:38.800]  They're just there in their class
[49:38.800 --> 49:40.800]  With all these other kids
[49:40.800 --> 49:42.800]  And oh, you don't, it says if they say
[49:42.800 --> 49:44.800]  Yuck, they go in the racism database
[49:44.800 --> 49:46.800]  Police are called
[49:46.800 --> 49:48.800]  Yuck is racism, just like
[49:48.800 --> 49:50.800]  They arrested Robin Page, BBC reporter
[49:50.800 --> 49:52.800]  For saying
[49:52.800 --> 49:54.800]  Rural communities have served the same rights as
[49:54.800 --> 49:56.800]  Muslims and homosexuals
[49:56.800 --> 49:58.800]  The word homosexual is scientific
[49:58.800 --> 50:00.800]  But it is considered by some to be hurtful
[50:00.800 --> 50:02.800]  He was arrested
[50:02.800 --> 50:04.800]  Toddlers who turn their noses up
[50:04.800 --> 50:06.800]  At spicy food from overseas
[50:06.800 --> 50:08.800]  Could be branded racist by
[50:08.800 --> 50:10.800]  A government sponsored agency
[50:12.800 --> 50:14.800]  See
[50:14.800 --> 50:16.800]  Now Steve Watson was detained
[50:16.800 --> 50:18.800]  For putting his hand
[50:18.800 --> 50:20.800]  In his pocket with his date
[50:20.800 --> 50:22.800]  Getting on a bus
[50:22.800 --> 50:24.800]  This just happened
[50:24.800 --> 50:26.800]  I have been detained for
[50:26.800 --> 50:28.800]  Videotaping in London
[50:28.800 --> 50:30.800]  Everyone, it's just
[50:30.800 --> 50:32.800]  Worse than East Germany
[50:32.800 --> 50:34.800]  At its height, there's just secret police
[50:34.800 --> 50:36.800]  Everywhere running up to you, it's all over
[50:38.800 --> 50:40.800]  This is the new system
[50:40.800 --> 50:42.800]  This is the new system
[50:42.800 --> 50:44.800]  If you question the government, your house gets robbed
[50:44.800 --> 50:46.800]  A day after, by the police
[50:46.800 --> 50:48.800]  I mean, this is it
[50:48.800 --> 51:10.800]  You're going into it, you understand?
[51:24.800 --> 51:26.800]  But before that
[51:26.800 --> 51:28.800]  He was known as a military genius
[51:28.800 --> 51:30.800]  With many a battlefield victory
[51:30.800 --> 51:32.800]  But few know of one of his
[51:32.800 --> 51:34.800]  Battle secrets
[51:34.800 --> 51:36.800]  Few know of one of his secrets
[51:36.800 --> 51:38.800]  That's called a trade secret
[51:38.800 --> 51:40.800]  And since his trade was war
[51:40.800 --> 51:42.800]  You might call it his war trade secret
[51:42.800 --> 51:44.800]  The story goes that it had to do
[51:44.800 --> 51:46.800]  With what they called the idiot
[51:46.800 --> 51:48.800]  Who was, according to story
[51:48.800 --> 51:50.800]  Stationed right outside
[51:50.800 --> 51:52.800]  His battlefield command tent
[51:52.800 --> 51:54.800]  So called because the man was
[51:54.800 --> 51:56.800]  Mentally slower than most men
[51:56.800 --> 51:58.800]  You might say he was
[51:58.800 --> 52:00.800]  Mentally impaired
[52:00.800 --> 52:02.800]  This man in Napoleon's employ
[52:02.800 --> 52:04.800]  Called the idiot
[52:04.800 --> 52:06.800]  Was responsible in part
[52:06.800 --> 52:08.800]  In great part
[52:08.800 --> 52:10.800]  For many of Napoleon's great victories
[52:10.800 --> 52:12.800]  It's quite a story
[52:12.800 --> 52:14.800]  How he used the idiot
[52:14.800 --> 52:16.800]  Battle field tactics and command
[52:16.800 --> 52:18.800]  And we tell that story
[52:18.800 --> 52:20.800]  At anotheruntoldstory.com

[52:24.800 --> 52:26.800]  Applies to you and the commander
[52:26.800 --> 52:28.800]  And chief over you
[52:28.800 --> 52:52.800]  Go to anotheruntoldstory.com
[52:52.800 --> 52:54.800]  On September 11th, 2001
[52:54.800 --> 52:56.800]  Along with hundreds
[52:56.800 --> 52:58.800]  Of my fellow troops I went to grounds here
[52:58.800 --> 53:00.800]  And we knew what to do
[53:00.800 --> 53:02.800]  Or at least we thought we did
[53:02.800 --> 53:04.800]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[53:04.800 --> 53:06.800]  That finally gives first responders
[53:06.800 --> 53:08.800]  A platform to tell their story
[53:08.800 --> 53:10.800]  Whitman
[53:10.800 --> 53:12.800]  EPA director
[53:12.800 --> 53:14.800]  On the 18th made a statement
[53:14.800 --> 53:16.800]  That the air
[53:16.800 --> 53:18.800]  Was safe to breathe
[53:18.800 --> 53:20.800]  This film follows the growing momentum
[53:20.800 --> 53:22.800]  Of 9-11 truth as brave souls
[53:22.800 --> 53:24.800]  Throughout the world take action
[53:24.800 --> 53:26.800]  To make their way to the stars
[53:26.800 --> 53:28.800]  He had his hand over the radio
[53:28.800 --> 53:30.800]  While he was getting a countdown
[53:30.800 --> 53:32.800]  He takes his hand off and you hear
[53:32.800 --> 53:34.800]  3, 2, 1, and it was boom
[53:34.800 --> 53:36.800]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
[53:36.800 --> 53:38.800]  This is an emergency transmission

[53:46.800 --> 53:48.800]  Or order the DVD at infowars.com
[53:48.800 --> 53:50.800]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror
[53:50.800 --> 53:52.800]  They're going to commit moracks
[53:52.800 --> 54:02.800]  Music
[54:02.800 --> 54:04.800]  I saw a report yesterday
[54:04.800 --> 54:06.800]  By the American Medical Association
[54:06.800 --> 54:08.800]  They said that
[54:08.800 --> 54:10.800]  Children as
[54:10.800 --> 54:12.800]  Young as 3
[54:12.800 --> 54:14.800]  Need to be put on anti-
[54:14.800 --> 54:16.800]  Cholesterol statins
[54:16.800 --> 54:18.800]  Now the studies are just now coming out
[54:18.800 --> 54:20.800]  That statins really don't help you
[54:20.800 --> 54:22.800]  Especially hurt you
[54:22.800 --> 54:24.800]  That what's making people die is trans fats
[54:24.800 --> 54:26.800]  Which just turned into like
[54:26.800 --> 54:28.800]  Basically plastic inside your arteries
[54:28.800 --> 54:30.800]  It builds up, it's not natural
[54:30.800 --> 54:32.800]  But that won't matter, they won't tell you not to eat those
[54:32.800 --> 54:34.800]  They'll just say reduce your cholesterol
[54:34.800 --> 54:36.800]  By the way your connective tissues
[54:36.800 --> 54:38.800]  Made out of, your collagen
[54:38.800 --> 54:40.800]  Your heart valves, your brain
[54:40.800 --> 54:42.800]  You actually need the quote good and bad cholesterol
[54:42.800 --> 54:44.800]  We've got all the studies on that
[54:44.800 --> 54:46.800]  People who don't even have seizures
[54:46.800 --> 54:48.800]  They don't get enough fat
[54:48.800 --> 54:50.800]  Seizures are way up
[54:50.800 --> 54:52.800]  With these people that have the
[54:52.800 --> 54:56.800]  Non-fat diets and don't get the type of fats they need
[54:56.800 --> 54:58.800]  Especially in some of these
[54:58.800 --> 55:00.800]  Hard core vegetarians that don't eat anything
[55:00.800 --> 55:02.800]  That's got any real fat in it
[55:02.800 --> 55:04.800]  I'm not knocking vegetarians, the point is
[55:04.800 --> 55:06.800]  You're going to get sick
[55:06.800 --> 55:08.800]  Now
[55:08.800 --> 55:10.800]  They don't care
[55:10.800 --> 55:12.800]  Of course it's Merck, the same folks that brought you
[55:12.800 --> 55:14.800]  Vioxx made, all people have the heart attacks
[55:14.800 --> 55:16.800]  Same people that brought you Gardasil
[55:16.800 --> 55:18.800]  This is how they're targeting the children
[55:18.800 --> 55:20.800]  This is even ABC News
[55:20.800 --> 55:22.800]  Admitting Gardasil under fire for health issues
[55:22.800 --> 55:24.800]  Now this is a whitewash
[55:24.800 --> 55:26.800]  The drug was really approved
[55:26.800 --> 55:28.800]  About 16 months ago
[55:28.800 --> 55:32.800]  Or in early 2007
[55:32.800 --> 55:34.800]  But they said it was approved 2 years ago
[55:34.800 --> 55:36.800]  And then they give the numbers
[55:36.800 --> 55:38.800]  The numbers we got a year ago
[55:38.800 --> 55:40.800]  When they first got some preliminaries
[55:40.800 --> 55:42.800]  There have been 7802
[55:42.800 --> 55:44.800]  Adverse event reports
[55:44.800 --> 55:46.800]  Remember about 1 in 10
[55:46.800 --> 55:48.800]  Where the new drug gets reported
[55:48.800 --> 55:50.800]  So you can say it's 10 times that
[55:50.800 --> 55:52.800]  Reports from, so that's close to
[55:52.800 --> 55:54.800]  70,000 something
[55:54.800 --> 55:56.800]  FDA approved its use 2 years ago
[55:56.800 --> 55:58.800]  According to the CDC
[55:58.800 --> 56:00.800]  Girls and women have blamed the vaccine
[56:00.800 --> 56:02.800]  For causing ailments from nausea to paralysis
[56:02.800 --> 56:04.800]  Even death
[56:04.800 --> 56:06.800]  I know women here in Austin that have taken it
[56:06.800 --> 56:08.800]  And almost died and had to have
[56:08.800 --> 56:10.800]  Parts of their bodies amputated
[56:10.800 --> 56:12.800]  The CDC says
[56:12.800 --> 56:14.800]  The 10 confirmed deaths were linked to the vaccine
[56:14.800 --> 56:16.800]  That's not true
[56:16.800 --> 56:18.800]  They admitted in the trials there were deaths
[56:18.800 --> 56:20.800]  So you'd read ABC News here
[56:20.800 --> 56:22.800]  And they go, boy, it's admitting
[56:22.800 --> 56:24.800]  You know, 7,000 plus have gotten
[56:24.800 --> 56:26.800]  Really sick and all this
[56:26.800 --> 56:28.800]  It's saying there's been 10 deaths
[56:28.800 --> 56:30.800]  But they're saying
[56:30.800 --> 56:32.800]  That part's not linked
[56:32.800 --> 56:34.800]  Then you go to Gardasil
[56:34.800 --> 56:36.800]  Merck's own website
[56:36.800 --> 56:38.800]  And it says it doesn't protect you
[56:38.800 --> 56:40.800]  From that particular virus
[56:40.800 --> 56:42.800]  I think it might
[56:42.800 --> 56:44.800]  But if you already are infected with the virus
[56:44.800 --> 56:46.800]  It's about half the women in America are
[56:46.800 --> 56:48.800]  Who are over the age of 20
[56:48.800 --> 56:50.800]  If you've had more than 3 sexual partners
[56:50.800 --> 56:52.800]  You probably got it, very common
[56:52.800 --> 56:54.800]  In fact, you can get it at playground
[56:54.800 --> 56:56.800]  You can get it at the gym, it's all over folks
[56:56.800 --> 56:58.800]  You ever had a ward on you?
[56:58.800 --> 57:00.800]  Well, most of those are this virus
[57:00.800 --> 57:02.800]  You ever had a ward, folks?
[57:02.800 --> 57:04.800]  Ever had one between your fingers?
[57:04.800 --> 57:06.800]  Ever had one? I mean, I've not had a lot of wards
[57:06.800 --> 57:08.800]  But I stepped on a nail when I was a kid and got one
[57:08.800 --> 57:10.800]  I got to go cut off or something
[57:10.800 --> 57:12.800]  Oh, it's tiny Gardasil, it's all over
[57:12.800 --> 57:14.800]  For me
[57:14.800 --> 57:16.800]  Now they're saying boys need it
[57:16.800 --> 57:18.800]  Boys need to have it
[57:18.800 --> 57:20.800]  Because it's associated with cancer
[57:20.800 --> 57:22.800]  And that's right, a woman gets into cervix
[57:22.800 --> 57:24.800]  And let's hundreds of wards grow over years
[57:24.800 --> 57:26.800]  It irritates the skin
[57:26.800 --> 57:28.800]  Just like cigarette smoke, irritates the lung tissue
[57:28.800 --> 57:30.800]  It breaks down the cell walls
[57:30.800 --> 57:32.800]  And then you get cancer
[57:32.800 --> 57:34.800]  But that's what happens
[57:34.800 --> 57:36.800]  Body parts that get extra wear and tear
[57:36.800 --> 57:38.800]  Cells only have so many divisions
[57:38.800 --> 57:40.800]  And then they wear out and malfunction
[57:40.800 --> 57:42.800]  So the wards make you have too many cell divisions
[57:42.800 --> 57:44.800]  And then you get cancer
[57:44.800 --> 57:46.800]  But if you go get them scraped off
[57:46.800 --> 57:48.800]  And get your gynecological exam and get cleaned up
[57:48.800 --> 57:50.800]  You're not going to get it
[57:50.800 --> 57:52.800]  But this shot gives you a 45% increase
[57:52.800 --> 57:54.800]  In getting a cancer
[57:54.800 --> 57:56.800]  They say we don't know if it prevents the cervical cancer
[57:56.800 --> 57:58.800]  But we know it gives you the cancer
[57:58.800 --> 58:00.800]  If you already have the virus
[58:02.800 --> 58:04.800]  Merck is telling you your death sentence
[58:04.800 --> 58:06.800]  But that's the weird contract law
[58:06.800 --> 58:08.800]  As long as you know what you're signing on to
[58:08.800 --> 58:10.800]  They can kill you
[58:12.800 --> 58:14.800]  Guard a cylinder of fire for health issues
[58:14.800 --> 58:16.800]  You'll see, it's the same company saying
[58:16.800 --> 58:18.800]  We want to put kids on heart medication
[58:18.800 --> 58:20.800]  Which fries your liver and everything else
[58:20.800 --> 58:22.800]  Yeah, let's put the three year olds
[58:22.800 --> 58:24.800]  On statin drugs
[58:24.800 --> 58:26.800]  Which admittedly are killing people wholesale
[58:26.800 --> 58:28.800]  But people are going to do it folks
[58:28.800 --> 58:34.800]  They do whatever the scumbag you Genesis tell them

[58:46.800 --> 58:48.800]  In the near future
[58:48.800 --> 58:52.800]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government
[58:52.800 --> 58:54.800]  It's known as the Bilderberg group
[58:54.800 --> 58:57.800]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[58:57.800 --> 58:59.800]  For thousands of years
[58:59.800 --> 59:01.800]  Their dark order grew
[59:01.800 --> 59:03.800]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order
[59:03.800 --> 59:05.800]  Their great dream
[59:05.800 --> 59:07.800]  Of exterminating 80% of humanity
[59:07.800 --> 59:09.800]  Is at hand

[59:19.800 --> 59:21.800]  The entire new world order agenda
[59:23.800 --> 59:25.800]  Most people have no idea
[59:25.800 --> 59:27.800]  They have all the money they need

[1:00:07.800 --> 1:00:09.800]  Live from Austin, Texas
[1:00:09.800 --> 1:00:11.800]  Alex Jones
[1:00:11.800 --> 1:00:13.800]  You have found it
[1:00:13.800 --> 1:00:15.800]  The solemn defense of humanity
[1:00:15.800 --> 1:00:17.800]  The solemn defense
[1:00:17.800 --> 1:00:19.800]  Of the unorganized
[1:00:19.800 --> 1:00:21.800]  World population
[1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:23.800]  Discovering a wicked eugenics plan
[1:00:23.800 --> 1:00:25.800]  To poison and dumb down
[1:00:25.800 --> 1:00:27.800]  The entire population
[1:00:27.800 --> 1:00:29.800]  To build a giant
[1:00:29.800 --> 1:00:31.800]  Police state world government
[1:00:31.800 --> 1:00:33.800]  To carry out the orderly extermination
[1:00:33.800 --> 1:00:35.800]  Of 80 to 90% of us bare minimum
[1:00:35.800 --> 1:00:37.800]  A lot of the globalists and transhumanists
[1:00:37.800 --> 1:00:39.800]  Say 99%
[1:00:39.800 --> 1:00:41.800]  Or total extermination of humanity
[1:00:41.800 --> 1:00:43.800]  They are completely psychopathic
[1:00:43.800 --> 1:00:45.800]  They control the issuance of currency
[1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:47.800]  And credit and world government
[1:00:47.800 --> 1:00:49.800]  They are upon us
[1:00:49.800 --> 1:00:51.800]  We'll be getting into the Federal Reserve
[1:00:51.800 --> 1:00:53.800]  With top experts on that
[1:00:53.800 --> 1:00:55.800]  The next hour and a half
[1:00:55.800 --> 1:00:57.800]  And Steve Watson detained by the secret police
[1:00:57.800 --> 1:00:59.800]  In England will be joining us
[1:00:59.800 --> 1:01:01.800]  I said I'd talk about my conversation
[1:01:01.800 --> 1:01:03.800]  With Governor Ventura this morning
[1:01:03.800 --> 1:01:05.800]  And I'll do that briefly after the break
[1:01:05.800 --> 1:01:07.800]  A serious example of media disinformation
[1:01:07.800 --> 1:01:09.800]  And propaganda coming up
[1:01:09.800 --> 1:01:11.800]  After the next break
[1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:15.800]  Some of the other news
[1:01:15.800 --> 1:01:17.800]  Imagine a science fiction movie
[1:01:17.800 --> 1:01:19.800]  Made 20, 30 years ago
[1:01:19.800 --> 1:01:21.800]  Where you heard headlines like this
[1:01:21.800 --> 1:01:23.800]  Toddlers who dislike spicy food
[1:01:23.800 --> 1:01:25.800]  Are wanted to be branded racist
[1:01:25.800 --> 1:01:27.800]  And police are to be called on them by
[1:01:27.800 --> 1:01:29.800]  Preschools
[1:01:29.800 --> 1:01:31.800]  The 366 page guide
[1:01:31.800 --> 1:01:33.800]  For staff in charge of preschool children
[1:01:33.800 --> 1:01:35.800]  And racial justice
[1:01:35.800 --> 1:01:37.800]  Warned racist incidents among children
[1:01:37.800 --> 1:01:39.800]  In early years settings tend to be
[1:01:39.800 --> 1:01:41.800]  Around name calling
[1:01:41.800 --> 1:01:43.800]  Casual foughtlessness comments
[1:01:43.800 --> 1:01:45.800]  In peer group relationships
[1:01:45.800 --> 1:01:47.800]  So teaching kids to be suppressed repressed
[1:01:47.800 --> 1:01:49.800]  You get in trouble if you say
[1:01:49.800 --> 1:01:51.800]  Yuck to jalapenos
[1:01:51.800 --> 1:01:53.800]  It advises nursery teachers
[1:01:53.800 --> 1:01:55.800]  To be on the alert for child abuse
[1:01:55.800 --> 1:01:57.800]  Such as
[1:01:57.800 --> 1:01:59.800]  And it goes on to say that
[1:01:59.800 --> 1:02:01.800]  You don't like the food
[1:02:01.800 --> 1:02:03.800]  Warned children might also react negatively
[1:02:03.800 --> 1:02:05.800]  To culinary traditions other than
[1:02:05.800 --> 1:02:07.800]  Their own by saying yuck
[1:02:07.800 --> 1:02:09.800]  And see it's not that the child doesn't
[1:02:09.800 --> 1:02:11.800]  Like curry
[1:02:11.800 --> 1:02:13.800]  Because it burns into
[1:02:13.800 --> 1:02:15.800]  Children's mouths in the subcontinent
[1:02:15.800 --> 1:02:17.800]  No, no, they have to be taught
[1:02:17.800 --> 1:02:19.800]  About the differences in race
[1:02:19.800 --> 1:02:21.800]  They have to be taught to dislike each other
[1:02:21.800 --> 1:02:23.800]  They have to get in a database and be criminals
[1:02:23.800 --> 1:02:25.800]  And have policemen come to two and
[1:02:25.800 --> 1:02:27.800]  Three-year-olds, it says it
[1:02:27.800 --> 1:02:29.800]  And see parents have to have a license
[1:02:29.800 --> 1:02:31.800]  To hug their children
[1:02:31.800 --> 1:02:33.800]  To change their diapers, you're going to be arrested
[1:02:33.800 --> 1:02:35.800]  It's all pedophilia, this is the sixth state
[1:02:35.800 --> 1:02:37.800]  Destroying the family
[1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:39.800]  Destroying everything, frying children
[1:02:39.800 --> 1:02:41.800]  This is behavioral psychologists saying
[1:02:41.800 --> 1:02:43.800]  How do we screw these children up
[1:02:43.800 --> 1:02:45.800]  As bad as we can cold bloodedly
[1:02:45.800 --> 1:02:47.800]  Remember, this is a government
[1:02:47.800 --> 1:02:49.800]  The British government that sprayed its country
[1:02:49.800 --> 1:02:51.800]  Hundreds of times declassified
[1:02:51.800 --> 1:02:53.800]  From end to end with chemicals
[1:02:53.800 --> 1:02:55.800]  Biologicals and radiologicals
[1:02:55.800 --> 1:02:57.800]  Bubonic plague
[1:02:57.800 --> 1:02:59.800]  Siren and VX nerve gas
[1:02:59.800 --> 1:03:01.800]  Murdering people in every
[1:03:01.800 --> 1:03:03.800]  Major town and city quietly
[1:03:03.800 --> 1:03:05.800]  Spraying neighborhoods, having the military
[1:03:05.800 --> 1:03:07.800]  Doctors at the local hospital cover up
[1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:09.800]  What happened to test how to cover up
[1:03:09.800 --> 1:03:11.800]  And to test what the agents do
[1:03:11.800 --> 1:03:13.800]  But to really create cadres of killers
[1:03:13.800 --> 1:03:15.800]  And if you're listening for the first time
[1:03:15.800 --> 1:03:17.800]  You do not roll your eyes at me
[1:03:17.800 --> 1:03:19.800]  Oh, you're going to check out
[1:03:19.800 --> 1:03:21.800]  What I just said tonight when you get home
[1:03:21.800 --> 1:03:23.800]  You're going to Google
[1:03:23.800 --> 1:03:25.800]  Google entire of
[1:03:25.800 --> 1:03:27.800]  England tested
[1:03:27.800 --> 1:03:29.800]  In secret army test
[1:03:29.800 --> 1:03:31.800]  Or plague bombs
[1:03:31.800 --> 1:03:33.800]  Dropped on Scotland
[1:03:33.800 --> 1:03:35.800]  Try that one, or
[1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:37.800]  U.S. troops killed in
[1:03:37.800 --> 1:03:39.800]  Chemical tests, try that
[1:03:39.800 --> 1:03:41.800]  It's thousands of articles
[1:03:41.800 --> 1:03:43.800]  All admitted how they're murdering you
[1:03:43.800 --> 1:03:45.800]  With pleasure
[1:03:45.800 --> 1:03:47.800]  I had to stand by when they gassed
[1:03:47.800 --> 1:03:49.800]  People down at the DPS eight years ago
[1:03:49.800 --> 1:03:51.800]  And of course the DPS came out
[1:03:51.800 --> 1:03:53.800]  Like I was the enemy out there
[1:03:53.800 --> 1:03:55.800]  And they'd had a test done on them
[1:03:55.800 --> 1:03:57.800]  They're all going to the hospital
[1:03:57.800 --> 1:03:59.800]  Falling down, vomiting, and I'm saying
[1:03:59.800 --> 1:04:01.800]  You've been tested on, you've been tested on
[1:04:01.800 --> 1:04:03.800]  But they don't care
[1:04:03.800 --> 1:04:05.800]  It's too important to believe the lies
[1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:07.800]  It's too important
[1:04:07.800 --> 1:04:09.800]  To be conned and manipulated
[1:04:09.800 --> 1:04:11.800]  You see the army had been in town that week
[1:04:11.800 --> 1:04:13.800]  They'd done a fake nuclear spill
[1:04:13.800 --> 1:04:15.800]  On I-35 and Kyle
[1:04:15.800 --> 1:04:17.800]  I had sources inside the army
[1:04:17.800 --> 1:04:19.800]  And in the city
[1:04:19.800 --> 1:04:21.800]  I went on air and said it was fake
[1:04:21.800 --> 1:04:23.800]  It was announced it was fake
[1:04:23.800 --> 1:04:25.800]  Then I said they're going to do
[1:04:25.800 --> 1:04:27.800]  Biological tests and chemical tests downtown
[1:04:27.800 --> 1:04:29.800]  And then they shut down downtown
[1:04:29.800 --> 1:04:31.800]  A bunch of people got sick, Austin police
[1:04:31.800 --> 1:04:33.800]  Collapsed, and then they hit the DPS
[1:04:33.800 --> 1:04:35.800]  With whatever it is
[1:04:35.800 --> 1:04:37.800]  This is your stinking government
[1:04:37.800 --> 1:04:39.800]  They're hurting you and your family
[1:04:39.800 --> 1:04:41.800]  For heaven's sakes, at least check into
[1:04:41.800 --> 1:04:43.800]  What I'm telling you
[1:04:43.800 --> 1:04:51.800]  Yeah
[1:04:51.800 --> 1:04:53.800]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close
[1:04:53.800 --> 1:04:55.800]  To the disaster of food costs
[1:04:55.800 --> 1:04:57.800]  From shortages already destroying
[1:04:57.800 --> 1:04:59.800]  Millions of American families
[1:04:59.800 --> 1:05:01.800]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive
[1:05:01.800 --> 1:05:03.800]  Than it was about a year ago
[1:05:03.800 --> 1:05:05.800]  Food costs continue to double because
[1:05:05.800 --> 1:05:07.800]  There's no food worldwide
[1:05:07.800 --> 1:05:09.800]  The only solution is to use now
[1:05:09.800 --> 1:05:11.800]  And store for later
[1:05:11.800 --> 1:05:13.800]  Super bulk foods that cost

[1:06:51.800 --> 1:06:53.800]  I've come with a message of information
[1:06:53.800 --> 1:06:55.800]  9-11 was an inside job
[1:06:55.800 --> 1:06:57.800]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[1:06:57.800 --> 1:06:59.800]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[1:06:59.800 --> 1:07:01.800]  How do the American people know
[1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:03.800]  That the nation was a stage
[1:07:03.800 --> 1:07:05.800]  Was engineered by you, David Rockefeller
[1:07:05.800 --> 1:07:07.800]  For a lateral commission to see it far
[1:07:07.800 --> 1:07:09.800]  We sit down and shadow
[1:07:09.800 --> 1:07:11.800]  The day that we stop asking questions
[1:07:11.800 --> 1:07:13.800]  Is the day that we have allowed the seeds
[1:07:13.800 --> 1:07:15.800]  Of just patism to grow at our own door
[1:07:15.800 --> 1:07:18.800]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11
[1:07:18.800 --> 1:07:21.800]  A global awakening has taken place
[1:07:21.800 --> 1:07:23.800]  An inside job
[1:07:23.800 --> 1:07:25.800]  How dare you
[1:07:25.800 --> 1:07:29.800]  If you know that there's treason going on
[1:07:29.800 --> 1:07:31.800]  You can be held accountable for treason yourself
[1:07:31.800 --> 1:07:34.800]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue
[1:07:34.800 --> 1:07:36.800]  And if the government has not told the truth
[1:07:36.800 --> 1:07:39.800]  In five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of life
[1:07:39.800 --> 1:07:40.800]  Truth rising

[1:07:45.800 --> 1:08:12.800]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level
[1:08:12.800 --> 1:08:15.800]  We're going to be joined by Pat Carmack and Bill Still
[1:08:15.800 --> 1:08:17.800]  The makers of the Money Masters
[1:08:17.800 --> 1:08:19.800]  The premonit film and the private banking cartel
[1:08:19.800 --> 1:08:21.800]  That owns and controls our society
[1:08:21.800 --> 1:08:23.800]  Here in just a few minutes
[1:08:23.800 --> 1:08:26.800]  I talked to Governor Jesse Ventura this morning
[1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:28.800]  Called him in his home
[1:08:28.800 --> 1:08:30.800]  Because I got up and got on the computer
[1:08:30.800 --> 1:08:32.800]  And had been working for a few hours
[1:08:32.800 --> 1:08:34.800]  When it suddenly popped up on Drudge
[1:08:34.800 --> 1:08:37.800]  The headline, Jesse Ventura to Run for Senate
[1:08:37.800 --> 1:08:39.800]  It's on
[1:08:39.800 --> 1:08:42.800]  And so I called Governor Ventura
[1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:45.800]  Because he had told us that he was going to announce
[1:08:45.800 --> 1:08:49.800]  One way or the other next Tuesday
[1:08:49.800 --> 1:08:53.800]  And we of course were lining him up for next week
[1:08:53.800 --> 1:08:55.800]  That was going to be a surprise
[1:08:55.800 --> 1:08:57.800]  And then suddenly
[1:08:57.800 --> 1:08:59.800]  Suddenly
[1:08:59.800 --> 1:09:03.800]  We see this from ABC News
[1:09:03.800 --> 1:09:06.800]  And so I called the governor
[1:09:06.800 --> 1:09:09.800]  And his quote was to me
[1:09:09.800 --> 1:09:11.800]  That the report was a lie
[1:09:11.800 --> 1:09:14.800]  A flat out misrepresentation
[1:09:14.800 --> 1:09:16.800]  Now the issue here is
[1:09:16.800 --> 1:09:19.800]  This is the political blog
[1:09:19.800 --> 1:09:21.800]  Put out by ABC News
[1:09:21.800 --> 1:09:24.800]  And I clearly believe it is meant to preempt
[1:09:24.800 --> 1:09:26.800]  Him getting any type of big media coverage
[1:09:26.800 --> 1:09:28.800]  Kind of a false start
[1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:31.800]  Or a stealing of
[1:09:31.800 --> 1:09:33.800]  Governor Ventura's thunder
[1:09:33.800 --> 1:09:35.800]  Because having him in the U.S. Senate
[1:09:35.800 --> 1:09:37.800]  He's 9-11's an inside job
[1:09:37.800 --> 1:09:39.800]  He knows about the private fellow reserve now
[1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:41.800]  He has seen a bunch of my films
[1:09:41.800 --> 1:09:43.800]  I first gave to him almost two years ago
[1:09:43.800 --> 1:09:45.800]  And then that caused him to watch loose change
[1:09:45.800 --> 1:09:47.800]  And fully wake up as he said here on air
[1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:50.800]  A few months ago when he went public on 9-11
[1:09:50.800 --> 1:09:53.800]  And so by them coming out
[1:09:53.800 --> 1:09:55.800]  And announcing that he will run
[1:09:55.800 --> 1:09:57.800]  Now when he says it next week
[1:09:57.800 --> 1:09:59.800]  If he does announce that he's running
[1:09:59.800 --> 1:10:02.800]  That will really dampen the amount of press it gets
[1:10:02.800 --> 1:10:04.800]  They know exactly what they're doing
[1:10:04.800 --> 1:10:06.800]  And the reason I know it's a setup by ABC
[1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:08.800]  Is because their proof
[1:10:08.800 --> 1:10:10.800]  When you go to the NPR website
[1:10:10.800 --> 1:10:12.800]  The interview Ventura says
[1:10:12.800 --> 1:10:14.800]  He's asked by NPR, well if you do run
[1:10:14.800 --> 1:10:16.800]  Why would you run?
[1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:18.800]  And then the headline on there says
[1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:20.800]  Ventura says he may run
[1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:22.800]  So ABC News, their source
[1:10:22.800 --> 1:10:24.800]  NPR was clear
[1:10:24.800 --> 1:10:26.800]  They said Jesse Ventura may run
[1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:28.800]  Well something he said a month ago
[1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:30.800]  Last time he was on here
[1:10:30.800 --> 1:10:32.800]  A month and a half ago
[1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:35.800]  So they report that
[1:10:35.800 --> 1:10:37.800]  And then ABC News runs the headline
[1:10:37.800 --> 1:10:39.800]  Now they changed their headline a few minutes ago
[1:10:39.800 --> 1:10:41.800]  But they did not
[1:10:41.800 --> 1:10:43.800]  Say that it was a retraction
[1:10:43.800 --> 1:10:46.800]  They just put a question mark after it
[1:10:46.800 --> 1:10:49.800]  But in the article itself they say
[1:10:49.800 --> 1:10:51.800]  That he will run for senate
[1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:53.800]  An interview with NPR's David Wellin
[1:10:53.800 --> 1:10:55.800]  That ran today
[1:10:55.800 --> 1:10:57.800]  Former Governor Jesse the body of Ventura
[1:10:57.800 --> 1:10:59.800]  Says he will run for the senate
[1:10:59.800 --> 1:11:01.800]  Challenging incumbent Senator Norm Coleman
[1:11:01.800 --> 1:11:03.800]  Who Ventura defeated for governor
[1:11:03.800 --> 1:11:04.800]  N98
[1:11:04.800 --> 1:11:06.800]  As was Democratic nominee and former
[1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:09.800]  Saturday Night Live humorous Al Franken
[1:11:09.800 --> 1:11:11.800]  And he goes on to give a
[1:11:11.800 --> 1:11:13.800]  I'll run because it angers me
[1:11:13.800 --> 1:11:15.800]  All you Minnesotans take a good
[1:11:15.800 --> 1:11:17.800]  Hard look at all three of us
[1:11:17.800 --> 1:11:19.800]  Well they cut the front part of the interview off
[1:11:19.800 --> 1:11:21.800]  He asks well if you do run why would you run
[1:11:21.800 --> 1:11:23.800]  And he says well if I did run it's because
[1:11:23.800 --> 1:11:25.800]  And then the rest of the quote
[1:11:25.800 --> 1:11:27.800]  So this was premeditated
[1:11:27.800 --> 1:11:30.800]  Lying by ABC
[1:11:30.800 --> 1:11:32.800]  Just like they just lied
[1:11:32.800 --> 1:11:34.800]  And said well there's been a bunch of deaths
[1:11:34.800 --> 1:11:36.800]  And thousands have gotten sick
[1:11:36.800 --> 1:11:38.800]  But the government says the deaths weren't
[1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:40.800]  Caused by Gardasil
[1:11:40.800 --> 1:11:42.800]  So
[1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:44.800]  We first reported USA Today
[1:11:44.800 --> 1:11:46.800]  About an hour after we reported it
[1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:48.800]  Did pick up that from the governor's
[1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:50.800]  Press office
[1:11:50.800 --> 1:11:52.800]  Former governor's press office
[1:11:52.800 --> 1:11:54.800]  That it is true that
[1:11:54.800 --> 1:11:56.800]  He has not announced he's running as we told you
[1:11:56.800 --> 1:11:58.800]  So we got it directly from
[1:11:58.800 --> 1:12:00.800]  The governor's mouth as they say
[1:12:00.800 --> 1:12:02.800]  Governor Ventura and
[1:12:02.800 --> 1:12:04.800]  If I was a betting man I'd say he's running next week
[1:12:04.800 --> 1:12:06.800]  He will announce next Tuesday
[1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:08.800]  Now he's not sure yet
[1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:10.800]  But
[1:12:10.800 --> 1:12:12.800]  I'm just going to give you a hint here
[1:12:12.800 --> 1:12:14.800]  He's leaning towards it
[1:12:14.800 --> 1:12:16.800]  We'll just say that
[1:12:16.800 --> 1:12:18.800]  So watch

[1:12:50.800 --> 1:12:52.800]  Classic.prisonplanet.com
[1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:54.800]  And I'm very proud of the work
[1:12:54.800 --> 1:12:56.800]  That Paul Watson, Kurt Nemo, Steve Watson
[1:12:56.800 --> 1:12:58.800]  Everybody are doing so please visit the websites
[1:12:58.800 --> 1:13:00.800]  Okay we do have
[1:13:00.800 --> 1:13:02.800]  Our guest on the line
[1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:04.800]  And they've got lengthy bios
[1:13:04.800 --> 1:13:06.800]  But I think it's better if they introduce themselves
[1:13:06.800 --> 1:13:08.800]  Bill Still and Pat Carmack
[1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:10.800]  Made an amazing film
[1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:12.800]  Bill Carmack of course
[1:13:12.800 --> 1:13:14.800]  Is the narrator
[1:13:14.800 --> 1:13:16.800]  And Pat's the producer
[1:13:16.800 --> 1:13:18.800]  And they both I guess co-produce it together
[1:13:18.800 --> 1:13:20.800]  I remember seeing this when it first came out
[1:13:20.800 --> 1:13:22.800]  In 98 we aired it over and over again
[1:13:22.800 --> 1:13:24.800]  Actually Jeff Davis put it on tape
[1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:26.800]  And turned it in and it aired probably
[1:13:26.800 --> 1:13:28.800]  50 times here locally
[1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:30.800]  Woke up so many people in Austin
[1:13:30.800 --> 1:13:32.800]  It was so popular
[1:13:32.800 --> 1:13:34.800]  Everybody was I mean it had a buzz on the street
[1:13:34.800 --> 1:13:36.800]  And it just methodically
[1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:38.800]  In a very genteel way
[1:13:38.800 --> 1:13:40.800]  An expert way lays out their whole system
[1:13:40.800 --> 1:13:42.800]  How they engineer collapses
[1:13:42.800 --> 1:13:44.800]  How they engineer depressions
[1:13:44.800 --> 1:13:46.800]  And they're doing that now
[1:13:46.800 --> 1:13:48.800]  And so not only we talk about the film
[1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:50.800]  The next hour and a half
[1:13:50.800 --> 1:13:52.800]  We talk about these guys are monetary specialists
[1:13:52.800 --> 1:13:54.800]  And I've heard them
[1:13:54.800 --> 1:13:56.800]  I really put forward a better plan than even Ron Paul has
[1:13:56.800 --> 1:13:58.800]  And I love Ron Paul
[1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:00.800]  But I do tend to agree with them
[1:14:00.800 --> 1:14:02.800]  That we don't want to have a gold standard
[1:14:02.800 --> 1:14:04.800]  Because the globalists own 95% of the gold
[1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:06.800]  And that would give them a new monopoly
[1:14:06.800 --> 1:14:08.800]  But not as bad as we have now
[1:14:08.800 --> 1:14:10.800]  They have a monetary reform act
[1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:12.800]  That it's at the end of their film
[1:14:12.800 --> 1:14:14.800]  That I remember studying 10 years ago
[1:14:14.800 --> 1:14:16.800]  That is very very effective
[1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:18.800]  And again their film The Money Masters
[1:14:18.800 --> 1:14:20.800]  Is available right now
[1:14:20.800 --> 1:14:22.800]  Get a masters degree in how they're
[1:14:22.800 --> 1:14:24.800]  The key to the globalist power
[1:14:24.800 --> 1:14:26.800]  How they bought up the world through fraud
[1:14:26.800 --> 1:14:28.800]  How they control the currency
[1:14:28.800 --> 1:14:30.800]  Is available at infowars.com
[1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:32.800]  And so without further ado
[1:14:32.800 --> 1:14:34.800]  We go to Bill Still and Pat Carmack
[1:14:34.800 --> 1:14:36.800]  Let's go to Bill first
[1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:38.800]  Bill tell us a little bit about yourself
[1:14:38.800 --> 1:14:40.800]  How you woke up who you are
[1:14:40.800 --> 1:14:42.800]  Then we'll go get that from Pat
[1:14:42.800 --> 1:14:44.800]  And then I want to go through the history of the bankers
[1:14:44.800 --> 1:14:46.800]  An abbreviated history
[1:14:46.800 --> 1:14:48.800]  Well I started out
[1:14:48.800 --> 1:14:50.800]  Life as a newspaper editor
[1:14:50.800 --> 1:14:52.800]  Here in northern Virginia
[1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:54.800]  One day an old gentleman called me up
[1:14:54.800 --> 1:14:56.800]  And said boy have I got a story for you
[1:14:56.800 --> 1:14:58.800]  There's no girl left in Fort Knox
[1:14:58.800 --> 1:15:00.800]  And I just kind of rolled my eyes
[1:15:00.800 --> 1:15:02.800]  And said yeah okay
[1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:04.800]  And you learn to develop a standard response
[1:15:04.800 --> 1:15:06.800]  Because you get a lot of crazies calling in
[1:15:06.800 --> 1:15:08.800]  And that as you say
[1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:10.800]  Well send me something in the mail
[1:15:10.800 --> 1:15:12.800]  Most people don't have anything to send
[1:15:12.800 --> 1:15:14.800]  Well two days later I got about a two inch thick
[1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:16.800]  Packet of stuff
[1:15:16.800 --> 1:15:18.800]  This guy was an Ohio implements
[1:15:18.800 --> 1:15:20.800]  A manufacturer
[1:15:20.800 --> 1:15:22.800]  He had moved to northern Virginia
[1:15:22.800 --> 1:15:24.800]  To pursue his hobby
[1:15:24.800 --> 1:15:26.800]  Which was to try to get
[1:15:26.800 --> 1:15:28.800]  The United States government
[1:15:28.800 --> 1:15:30.800]  To provide a physical audit
[1:15:30.800 --> 1:15:32.800]  Of the gold reserves in Fort Knox
[1:15:32.800 --> 1:15:34.800]  It's required to do so
[1:15:34.800 --> 1:15:36.800]  By law on an annual basis
[1:15:36.800 --> 1:15:38.800]  Yet one has not been done since 1957
[1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:40.800]  This guy obviously knew
[1:15:40.800 --> 1:15:42.800]  What he was doing
[1:15:42.800 --> 1:15:44.800]  This guy obviously knew what he was talking about
[1:15:44.800 --> 1:15:46.800]  He letters from
[1:15:46.800 --> 1:15:48.800]  Treasury officials
[1:15:48.800 --> 1:15:50.800]  Mint officials
[1:15:50.800 --> 1:15:52.800]  All the senators
[1:15:52.800 --> 1:15:54.800]  Congressman and all that
[1:15:54.800 --> 1:15:56.800]  But it just took me about 15 years
[1:15:56.800 --> 1:15:58.800]  To figure out what in the heck
[1:15:58.800 --> 1:16:00.800]  Does gold have to do with
[1:16:00.800 --> 1:16:02.800]  A better reserve than any of this
[1:16:02.800 --> 1:16:04.800]  And I finally figured it out
[1:16:04.800 --> 1:16:06.800]  Wrote a book called
[1:16:06.800 --> 1:16:08.800]  On the horns of the beast of the better reserve
[1:16:08.800 --> 1:16:10.800]  In the new world
[1:16:10.800 --> 1:16:12.800]  He called me up
[1:16:12.800 --> 1:16:14.800]  And he said let's do something else
[1:16:14.800 --> 1:16:16.800]  Let's do a video and so off we went
[1:16:16.800 --> 1:16:18.800]  And that's how it got started
[1:16:18.800 --> 1:16:20.800]  Okay fantastic
[1:16:20.800 --> 1:16:22.800]  Let's now go ahead and get
[1:16:22.800 --> 1:16:24.800]  Pat Carmack to introduce himself
[1:16:24.800 --> 1:16:26.800]  And tell us how he went down the rabbit hole
[1:16:26.800 --> 1:16:28.800]  Well I was in
[1:16:28.800 --> 1:16:30.800]  The oil business in Oklahoma
[1:16:30.800 --> 1:16:32.800]  And
[1:16:32.800 --> 1:16:34.800]  Naturally get involved in finance
[1:16:34.800 --> 1:16:36.800]  And the prosperity
[1:16:36.800 --> 1:16:38.800]  Of the banks and their growth
[1:16:38.800 --> 1:16:40.800]  Rapidly increasing wealth
[1:16:40.800 --> 1:16:42.800]  Attracted my attention
[1:16:42.800 --> 1:16:44.800]  And just from a business perspective
[1:16:44.800 --> 1:16:46.800]  I wanted to understand
[1:16:46.800 --> 1:16:48.800]  Why the banks were doing well
[1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:50.800]  Regardless of the general state of the economy
[1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:52.800]  And you discovered it was fractional reserve banking
[1:16:52.800 --> 1:16:54.800]  Ultimately that's right
[1:16:54.800 --> 1:16:56.800]  It's fractional reserve banking
[1:16:56.800 --> 1:16:58.800]  And it's rooted in the Federal Reserve Act of 1913
[1:16:58.800 --> 1:17:00.800]  There was a long history to it
[1:17:00.800 --> 1:17:02.800]  And Bill had already
[1:17:02.800 --> 1:17:04.800]  An excellent job probing into that
[1:17:04.800 --> 1:17:06.800]  And as Bill mentioned
[1:17:06.800 --> 1:17:08.800]  I wanted to put it in a more accessible format
[1:17:08.800 --> 1:17:10.800]  Because there's actually a lot of books on this topic
[1:17:10.800 --> 1:17:12.800]  It's just people don't read them
[1:17:12.800 --> 1:17:14.800]  They're unfamiliar with them and they don't get press
[1:17:14.800 --> 1:17:16.800]  What do you do in the oil business?
[1:17:16.800 --> 1:17:18.800]  Everything exploration production
[1:17:18.800 --> 1:17:20.800]  Owned a utility company
[1:17:20.800 --> 1:17:22.800]  Wow
[1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:24.800]  You kind of sound like a landman
[1:17:24.800 --> 1:17:26.800]  No I'm an attorney actually
[1:17:26.800 --> 1:17:28.800]  Yeah
[1:17:28.800 --> 1:17:30.800]  You know most landmen are
[1:17:30.800 --> 1:17:32.800]  But anyways
[1:17:32.800 --> 1:17:34.800]  A lot of money you're right
[1:17:34.800 --> 1:17:36.800]  But I got out of the oil business
[1:17:36.800 --> 1:17:38.800]  Back in 1991
[1:17:38.800 --> 1:17:40.800]  And I redirected my attention elsewhere
[1:17:40.800 --> 1:17:42.800]  And one of the things that
[1:17:42.800 --> 1:17:44.800]  Shortly after that that we did was Bill and I connected
[1:17:44.800 --> 1:17:46.800]  And did the video
[1:17:46.800 --> 1:17:48.800]  Which took about six months and
[1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:50.800]  Was filmed all over the world
[1:17:50.800 --> 1:17:52.800]  And now we ship it all over the world
[1:17:52.800 --> 1:17:54.800]  As you mentioned
[1:17:54.800 --> 1:17:56.800]  It's kind of a classic now in the subject
[1:17:56.800 --> 1:17:58.800]  Because it is partly a history
[1:17:58.800 --> 1:18:00.800]  And there's nothing like it
[1:18:00.800 --> 1:18:02.800]  This goes back to the origins of it
[1:18:02.800 --> 1:18:04.800]  Now we're living with what you
[1:18:04.800 --> 1:18:06.800]  At the end of the film you say is going to happen
[1:18:06.800 --> 1:18:08.800]  How they're going to basically
[1:18:08.800 --> 1:18:10.800]  Devalue the currency
[1:18:10.800 --> 1:18:12.800]  And consolidate it
[1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:14.800]  And now we see them and
[1:18:14.800 --> 1:18:16.800]  What is it like to see the blind general public guys
[1:18:16.800 --> 1:18:18.800]  Who you try to tell they're devaluing the dollar
[1:18:18.800 --> 1:18:20.800]  And they just say what's that
[1:18:20.800 --> 1:18:22.800]  Well it's
[1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:24.800]  It's interesting
[1:18:24.800 --> 1:18:26.800]  Because we were far enough ahead of our time
[1:18:26.800 --> 1:18:28.800]  So the times were just catching up to us
[1:18:28.800 --> 1:18:30.800]  Hopefully we weren't so far ahead
[1:18:30.800 --> 1:18:32.800]  That we'll get forgotten in the shuffle
[1:18:34.800 --> 1:18:36.800]  I first saw your film in 98
[1:18:36.800 --> 1:18:38.800]  When did it come out?
[1:18:38.800 --> 1:18:40.800]  96
[1:18:40.800 --> 1:18:42.800]  Maybe it was 97 I saw it
[1:18:42.800 --> 1:18:44.800]  It was somewhere right when it first came out
[1:18:44.800 --> 1:18:46.800]  We've got about a minute before we break
[1:18:46.800 --> 1:18:48.800]  When we get back
[1:18:48.800 --> 1:18:50.800]  Where should we start
[1:18:50.800 --> 1:18:52.800]  Bill and Pat
[1:18:52.800 --> 1:18:54.800]  Well probably on the root of the problem
[1:18:54.800 --> 1:18:56.800]  Because it's not
[1:18:56.800 --> 1:18:58.800]  The superficial economic
[1:18:58.800 --> 1:19:00.800]  Problems which are serious
[1:19:00.800 --> 1:19:02.800]  Like unemployment and so on deficit
[1:19:02.800 --> 1:19:04.800]  But deeper the root of the economic problem
[1:19:04.800 --> 1:19:06.800]  We're facing
[1:19:06.800 --> 1:19:08.800]  Alright
[1:19:08.800 --> 1:19:10.800]  Is the cause of most world poverty
[1:19:10.800 --> 1:19:12.800]  At this point
[1:19:12.800 --> 1:19:14.800]  Really important subject
[1:19:14.800 --> 1:19:16.800]  Oh absolutely there's nothing more important than understanding
[1:19:16.800 --> 1:19:18.800]  Where all of this new world order power flows
[1:19:18.800 --> 1:19:20.800]  From why are they able
[1:19:20.800 --> 1:19:22.800]  To finance it all
[1:19:22.800 --> 1:19:24.800]  Well they literally control the issuance of currency
[1:19:24.800 --> 1:19:26.800]  And credit and liquidity
[1:19:26.800 --> 1:19:28.800]  Bill Still and Pat Carmack
[1:19:28.800 --> 1:19:30.800]  The Money Masters the film
[1:19:30.800 --> 1:19:32.800]  We are carrying it on DVD
[1:19:32.800 --> 1:19:34.800]  At infowars.com
[1:19:34.800 --> 1:19:36.800]  Only 1995 ladies and gentlemen
[1:19:36.800 --> 1:19:38.800]  To get the full history of
[1:19:38.800 --> 1:19:40.800]  The true owners of the planet
[1:19:40.800 --> 1:19:42.800]  Now they got control of the planet through fraud
[1:19:42.800 --> 1:19:44.800]  That means it's illegitimate
[1:19:44.800 --> 1:19:46.800]  That means we can declare independence
[1:19:46.800 --> 1:19:56.800]  Against these robber bearers
[1:20:36.800 --> 1:20:38.800]  Knowledge is power
[1:20:38.800 --> 1:20:40.800]  And the information you need
[1:20:40.800 --> 1:20:42.800]  To effectively wake up your fellow man
[1:20:42.800 --> 1:20:44.800]  And fight the new world order
[1:20:44.800 --> 1:20:50.200]  On invasion,
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  Killing.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:54.500]  Now you can get back on your feet
[1:21:02.500 --> 1:21:05.500]  All nations will add to this
[1:21:05.500 --> 1:21:08.520]  For the US world is the right of future
[1:21:08.520 --> 1:21:10.520]  We're bringing you relationships
[1:21:10.520 --> 1:21:15.000]  and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  over.
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:20.220]  They are called Illuminati, elite, opponents of the New World Order.
[1:21:20.220 --> 1:21:23.000]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:27.520]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago, everything they have built
[1:21:27.520 --> 1:21:32.200]  over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning
[1:21:32.200 --> 1:21:37.200]  of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority
[1:21:37.200 --> 1:21:39.780]  that has now been delegated to us.
[1:21:39.780 --> 1:21:48.160]  Visit our website at UnveilingThem.com, that's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G, them.com, the message of
[1:21:48.160 --> 1:21:49.840]  His Kingdom.
[1:21:49.840 --> 1:21:54.040]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[1:21:54.040 --> 1:21:59.040]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching
[1:21:59.040 --> 1:22:06.680]  a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[1:22:06.680 --> 1:22:11.200]  The U.S. economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution
[1:22:11.200 --> 1:22:13.080]  called the Federal Reserve System.
[1:22:13.080 --> 1:22:17.200]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[1:22:17.200 --> 1:22:21.160]  It's bad enough that the U.S. citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[1:22:21.160 --> 1:22:25.480]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of
[1:22:25.480 --> 1:22:27.680]  growth in a stock portfolio.

[1:23:49.600 --> 1:23:55.200]  We're talking about the owners of the globe.
[1:23:55.200 --> 1:24:01.640]  They did it through a massive scam, a fraud, a trick of the money changers, of the gold
[1:24:01.640 --> 1:24:09.720]  smiths, and Bill still tells me the real expert, the brain behind the film is Pat Carmack, so
[1:24:09.720 --> 1:24:11.800]  we'll talk to him both here on air now.
[1:24:11.800 --> 1:24:14.960]  Okay, Bill, you've gotten to the point of you start waking up, you start looking at
[1:24:14.960 --> 1:24:19.920]  banking, then you get connected in with Bill still, you guys decide to make a film.
[1:24:19.920 --> 1:24:20.920]  Go through it.
[1:24:20.920 --> 1:24:24.200]  I mean, go through the big secret, the biggest game in town here.
[1:24:24.200 --> 1:24:31.600]  Well, actually, we had some help from Milton Friedman during the making of the film.
[1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:33.480]  It kind of morphed slightly.
[1:24:33.480 --> 1:24:40.080]  I talked to Friedman out at Stanford, he was a professor at Stanford University, and
[1:24:40.080 --> 1:24:44.640]  he said, boy, you know, if you kill the Federal Reserve System, you haven't done anything
[1:24:44.640 --> 1:24:46.640]  unless you kill Fractional Reserve, too.
[1:24:46.640 --> 1:24:53.640]  And so that kind of re-emphasized the importance of the Fraction Reserve System as well.
[1:24:53.640 --> 1:24:55.960]  I'll let Pat take it from there.
[1:24:55.960 --> 1:25:03.200]  Well, what Dr. Friedman talked about with us and wrote to us about was, you know, as
[1:25:03.200 --> 1:25:07.440]  Bill Mccintosh Fractional Reserve banking, and what it is, it's where the banks literally
[1:25:07.440 --> 1:25:09.600]  create money.
[1:25:09.600 --> 1:25:14.760]  And obviously, if banks can create money and they loan it at interest, then they have,
[1:25:14.760 --> 1:25:19.240]  you know, the goose that laid the gold leg and the money starts flowing to them, and
[1:25:19.240 --> 1:25:25.680]  the wealth gets concentrated in our society in the hands of bankers, and the key, I want
[1:25:25.680 --> 1:25:30.920]  you to speak to this, they have an incentive to get real assets to over extend people's
[1:25:30.920 --> 1:25:34.520]  credit, wanting them to not pay it back so they get real assets.
[1:25:34.520 --> 1:25:35.520]  Sure.
[1:25:35.520 --> 1:25:41.320]  Whenever there's a recession or depression, then they're able to foreclose on, you know,
[1:25:41.320 --> 1:25:44.840]  the people who can't pay the bills, and that's inevitable when they tighten credit.
[1:25:44.840 --> 1:25:47.880]  So, so, so that's their boom time is our bust.
[1:25:47.880 --> 1:25:50.320]  That's the vampire feeding.
[1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:51.320]  That's right.
[1:25:51.320 --> 1:25:52.320]  But you have to understand mainly the big banks.
[1:25:52.320 --> 1:25:56.040]  The small banks often are victimized too, but they're not part of the, you know, of
[1:25:56.040 --> 1:25:58.120]  the insiders on the global scale.
[1:25:58.120 --> 1:25:59.120]  Yes.
[1:25:59.120 --> 1:26:01.480]  It's always a sharing and consolidation period.
[1:26:01.480 --> 1:26:02.480]  Continue.
[1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:07.240]  Well, for instance, you know, the five major banks in this country have over one million
[1:26:07.240 --> 1:26:14.040]  employees that work directly for them of the $6 trillion of deposits in banks.
[1:26:14.040 --> 1:26:18.400]  These five major banks control approximately 3.5 trillion.
[1:26:18.400 --> 1:26:23.560]  So over half of the money in the entire country is five major banks, and they have interlocking
[1:26:23.560 --> 1:26:24.560]  directorates.
[1:26:24.560 --> 1:26:28.120]  So it's very easy to see how they can control the entire economy.
[1:26:28.120 --> 1:26:32.280]  If you can, if anyone can control the economy and they can, and this was one of Friedman's
[1:26:32.280 --> 1:26:37.960]  main critiques of the existing system, that's too much power to put in the hands of a handful
[1:26:37.960 --> 1:26:38.960]  of people.
[1:26:38.960 --> 1:26:41.480]  And we're now seeing accelerated vertical integration.
[1:26:41.480 --> 1:26:44.600]  Yes, and that's just concentration of wealth.
[1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:46.320]  It's happening on a global scale too.
[1:26:46.320 --> 1:26:50.960]  I mean, it's, it, there's virtually no nations that are exempt from this because they all
[1:26:50.960 --> 1:26:54.200]  have fallen into this fractional reserve banking system.
[1:26:54.200 --> 1:26:58.720]  In short, they've turned over to private banks or private corporations owned by private
[1:26:58.720 --> 1:27:04.560]  persons, their economies, and the result is those people are using it to concentrate wealth
[1:27:04.560 --> 1:27:05.560]  even further.
[1:27:05.560 --> 1:27:11.520]  And it's been released figures that approximately 200 people now own as much of the world as
[1:27:11.520 --> 1:27:14.520]  the poorest 3 billion.
[1:27:14.520 --> 1:27:22.400]  And in the United States, it's not far from that 1% own 95% of the wealth, 13,000 families
[1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:31.880]  on as much as in the United States on as much as 20, the rest 20% of the poorest people
[1:27:31.880 --> 1:27:35.520]  in the United States, which would be about 60 million people, but it's not just how much
[1:27:35.520 --> 1:27:39.720]  they own by having that much wealth, they can also then steer and control the rest.
[1:27:39.720 --> 1:27:41.720]  Yeah, it's leveraged very well.
[1:27:41.720 --> 1:27:46.160]  I mean, in other words, the average person owns a home, a car, a few minor assets.
[1:27:46.160 --> 1:27:49.440]  When you exceed, you know, the power to pay your utilities and all, then you start putting
[1:27:49.440 --> 1:27:55.520]  it, at least if you're power hungry, start putting it into media, into political donations
[1:27:55.520 --> 1:27:56.520]  to politicians.
[1:27:56.520 --> 1:28:01.280]  You know, you leverage it so that, so that even though they're, you know, they may not
[1:28:01.280 --> 1:28:04.280]  own everything in this country yet and they certainly don't.
[1:28:04.280 --> 1:28:06.960]  It's leveraged for a maximum political power.
[1:28:06.960 --> 1:28:10.160]  Right, the word, the operative word is hegemony.
[1:28:10.160 --> 1:28:13.880]  In other words, you don't have to own everything to control most of it.
[1:28:13.880 --> 1:28:20.360]  You know, everyone always complains these days that Washington doesn't seem to be responsive
[1:28:20.360 --> 1:28:21.720]  to the voting electorate.
[1:28:21.720 --> 1:28:28.960]  And this is why, because money has become concentrated into so few hands that they control the political
[1:28:28.960 --> 1:28:33.680]  process, whether the politicians going in think that they can do it or not.
[1:28:33.680 --> 1:28:35.240]  They ultimately can.
[1:28:35.240 --> 1:28:42.040]  So by eliminating, by reforming our monetary system, it not only gives more money to the
[1:28:42.040 --> 1:28:46.400]  rest of us, it also returns our democracy to us.
[1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:47.400]  Absolutely.
[1:28:47.400 --> 1:28:48.400]  Please continue.
[1:28:48.400 --> 1:28:55.600]  Well, we were talking about the root of it and it's this fractional reserve banking and
[1:28:55.600 --> 1:28:56.600]  we go into the history.
[1:28:56.600 --> 1:29:03.640]  It goes way back, but in terms of modern times, it really started in the 1600s in Sweden with
[1:29:03.640 --> 1:29:07.280]  the Reich's bank there, which made loans to the government, even though it was a private
[1:29:07.280 --> 1:29:08.280]  bank.
[1:29:08.280 --> 1:29:10.040]  We're going to break in a moment, sir.
[1:29:10.040 --> 1:29:13.400]  Long segment coming up was one of an interruption for a while.
[1:29:13.400 --> 1:29:17.880]  But I think it's important to go back even earlier so people get a basic grasp of what
[1:29:17.880 --> 1:29:18.880]  money is.
[1:29:18.880 --> 1:29:24.880]  You know, it's just a greed upon symbol of wealth to get past just barter and maybe get
[1:29:24.880 --> 1:29:28.160]  into the tally sticks and things like you guys do.
[1:29:28.160 --> 1:29:32.040]  Because I think it's important to understand first that and then accelerate through.
[1:29:32.040 --> 1:29:37.040]  We're talking to some of the leading experts on the banking system, on the owners of the
[1:29:37.040 --> 1:29:40.600]  planet, Pat Carmack and Bill Still.
[1:29:40.600 --> 1:29:51.160]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:29:51.160 --> 1:29:56.160]  Question is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[1:29:56.160 --> 1:30:01.160]  The world economic collapse could come any day.
[1:30:01.160 --> 1:30:07.280]  Question are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[1:30:07.280 --> 1:30:14.960]  Question do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?

[1:31:47.080 --> 1:31:50.000]  or thirty dollars outside the US.
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:55.600]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Sierra
[1:31:55.600 --> 1:31:59.120]  and we knew what to do or at least we thought we did.
[1:31:59.120 --> 1:32:04.400]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[1:32:04.400 --> 1:32:06.000]  to tell their story.
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:15.000]  Whitman, EVA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:19.760]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world
[1:32:19.760 --> 1:32:21.960]  take action against their global masters.
[1:32:21.960 --> 1:32:25.160]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[1:32:25.160 --> 1:32:31.000]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[1:32:40.360 --> 1:32:43.000]  the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:46.680]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[1:32:46.680 --> 1:33:05.760]  and bring in martial law.
[1:33:05.760 --> 1:33:11.360]  I'd love to stick David Rockefeller, Queen Elizabeth, Queen Beatrix, Lord Rothschild
[1:33:11.360 --> 1:33:16.920]  in Folsom Prison.
[1:33:16.920 --> 1:33:23.960]  Not only do they control the issuance of currency credit liquidity and steer the world's wealth,
[1:33:23.960 --> 1:33:26.040]  they're also into eugenics.
[1:33:26.040 --> 1:33:30.160]  That's the other part of this equation.
[1:33:30.160 --> 1:33:36.920]  They are very sinister people and they control our destiny and future as long as they have
[1:33:36.920 --> 1:33:38.320]  control of the monetary system.
[1:33:38.320 --> 1:33:42.880]  We're going to go right back to our guests in just a moment, again, the new film that

[1:33:48.280 --> 1:33:52.560]  carried out, bombs in the buildings, but who the 9-11 truth movement is, how the media
[1:33:52.560 --> 1:33:56.320]  is trying to set us up with talking points saying we're terrorists, police walking up
[1:33:56.320 --> 1:34:00.160]  saying we're going to plant bombs on you and say you're terrorists, incredible stuff, world
[1:34:00.160 --> 1:34:07.080]  leaders being confronted, Willie Nelson, Jesse Ventura, Martin Sheen, George Carlin, we interviewed
[1:34:07.080 --> 1:34:13.000]  him a few months ago, just died, all in the new film available on DVD at infowars.com.

[1:34:41.400 --> 1:34:46.720]  Going back to our guest, we're talking to Pat Carmack, the producer and director and
[1:34:46.720 --> 1:34:50.360]  of course the fellow that narrated it and traveled all over the world, it's an amazing
[1:34:50.360 --> 1:34:52.040]  film, Bill Still.
[1:34:52.040 --> 1:34:57.800]  Pat, we were getting into the history of money, how this happened, you've got the floor,
[1:34:57.800 --> 1:35:01.960]  you and Bill just, again, go back and forth amongst yourselves.
[1:35:01.960 --> 1:35:08.040]  Well, you know, the definition of money varies, there's different definitions out there.
[1:35:08.040 --> 1:35:16.400]  Aristotle defined it as simply a medium of exchange and more recently, Von Mice's Austrian
[1:35:16.400 --> 1:35:22.720]  school is defined as a commodity that's used as a medium of exchange, which is a nuance
[1:35:22.720 --> 1:35:28.040]  that results in people advancing the gold standard more than those who understand Aristotle.
[1:35:28.040 --> 1:35:32.640]  But for Aristotle it was anything, it's anything that people agree on can be used as a medium
[1:35:32.640 --> 1:35:35.880]  of exchange so we get beyond the barter system.
[1:35:35.880 --> 1:35:39.440]  In a complex society, if someone builds a car, for instance, it's very hard for them
[1:35:39.440 --> 1:35:46.400]  to trade it for groceries, there has to be some medium that has a value that can be applied
[1:35:46.400 --> 1:35:50.840]  to both of those items, so you can sell a car for money and you can buy groceries for
[1:35:50.840 --> 1:35:57.840]  money and what it's, again, what it's constituted by is just subject to different definitions
[1:35:57.840 --> 1:36:00.840]  and cultural heritages.
[1:36:00.840 --> 1:36:06.640]  You're aware that in this country when the original discoverers came here, the Native
[1:36:06.640 --> 1:36:13.520]  Americans used wampum or seashells, it's perfectly alright in Oceania, in certain islands they
[1:36:13.520 --> 1:36:21.280]  use large rocks that have a hole in them and we use paper, at one time our paper had some
[1:36:21.280 --> 1:36:27.080]  tied to gold and no longer does, so money is really whatever people agree to accept
[1:36:27.080 --> 1:36:34.000]  in exchange for goods or services, so that's the formal definition of it.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:43.440]  As a practical matter, the most common forms of money became gold and silver over time
[1:36:43.440 --> 1:36:51.320]  because they're relatively rare, they have other value, valuable uses and they're durable
[1:36:51.320 --> 1:36:56.760]  and so they have various qualities that lend themselves, for instance you couldn't use
[1:36:56.760 --> 1:37:01.040]  a mercury because the liquid you can't put in your pocket and so forth, so these had
[1:37:01.040 --> 1:37:07.120]  various qualities that helped facilitate that use, but there's nothing intrinsically
[1:37:07.120 --> 1:37:14.720]  about gold or silver that makes them more valuable, more useful as money.
[1:37:14.720 --> 1:37:22.240]  And as I might say, Julius Caesar, for example, was very popular with the population because
[1:37:22.240 --> 1:37:28.280]  he made coins, he made money plentiful, these coins were not necessarily gold and silver
[1:37:28.280 --> 1:37:34.920]  coins, they were copper coins primarily, actually he just announced that this would
[1:37:34.920 --> 1:37:42.360]  be the coin of the realm and so they circulated just like money, gold and silver is not necessary
[1:37:42.360 --> 1:37:48.320]  for coinage or for money, Caesar was very popular, he won the hearts of the people with
[1:37:48.320 --> 1:37:55.920]  this plentiful supply of government-issued money, he built the Roman Empire and as a
[1:37:55.920 --> 1:38:00.040]  matter of fact that's good for the people, but if it's good for the people, who is it
[1:38:00.040 --> 1:38:01.040]  bad for?
[1:38:01.040 --> 1:38:05.680]  It was bad for the senators and so that's why the Senate murdered him.
[1:38:05.680 --> 1:38:16.400]  And to be clear, because having King Henry in England got tired of the goldsmiths either
[1:38:16.400 --> 1:38:23.800]  lending out their gold money plentifully or hoarding it and reducing the money supply,
[1:38:23.800 --> 1:38:26.280]  when they reduce the money supply, what happens?
[1:38:26.280 --> 1:38:31.200]  It's just like when the money supply in your pocket is reduced, you feel poor, a depression
[1:38:31.200 --> 1:38:35.360]  sets in, when you have plenty of money, you have plenty of money in your pocket and you
[1:38:35.360 --> 1:38:38.440]  spend freely, it's the good times.
[1:38:38.440 --> 1:38:46.360]  Well, what the goldsmiths found out is that beyond their own pocketbook, they could control
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:50.200]  the political destiny of the sovereign, of the king.
[1:38:50.200 --> 1:38:53.320]  If they created a depression, they didn't get the blame.
[1:38:53.320 --> 1:38:56.760]  The king got the blame just as we see today.
[1:38:56.760 --> 1:39:01.880]  The Federal Reserve has caused this problem with our financial system right now and who's
[1:39:01.880 --> 1:39:07.000]  getting the blame, the president, just as the next president will get even greater blame,
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:09.320]  no matter which president it is.
[1:39:09.320 --> 1:39:15.560]  So King Henry in 1100 AD got tired of this, so he created his own money.
[1:39:15.560 --> 1:39:19.840]  It was not gold or silver coins, which the goldsmiths, of course, had a monopoly on.
[1:39:19.840 --> 1:39:26.720]  It was merely sticks of polished wood with notches cut in the sticks to denote the denomination
[1:39:26.720 --> 1:39:30.880]  and then the stick was split down the middle to prevent counterfeiting.
[1:39:30.880 --> 1:39:36.000]  These were called tally sticks, just as in the Roman Empire.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:40.920]  Once there was plentiful government-issued money outside of the hands of the goldsmiths,
[1:39:40.920 --> 1:39:47.480]  who, of course, hoarded all the profit from money, when they were issuing only their gold
[1:39:47.480 --> 1:39:55.200]  coins, suddenly that profit went to the government, and so the greatest empire in the history
[1:39:55.200 --> 1:39:59.640]  of the world, the British Empire, the empire upon which the sun never set, was built on
[1:39:59.640 --> 1:40:03.560]  the back of this tally stick money.
[1:40:03.560 --> 1:40:09.520]  Tally sticks served as money for over 700 years until, once the Bank of England, the
[1:40:09.520 --> 1:40:14.600]  first privately owned central bank in England, became established, they eventually were able
[1:40:14.600 --> 1:40:16.720]  to outlaw the tally stick system.
[1:40:16.720 --> 1:40:17.720]  Okay, Bill.
[1:40:17.720 --> 1:40:19.440]  That is what the essence of this is.
[1:40:19.440 --> 1:40:24.400]  That's what Abraham Lincoln did with issuing goldback, greenback money.
[1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:27.360]  That is money issued by the Congress of the United States.
[1:40:27.360 --> 1:40:29.000]  Yes, it's fiat money.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:32.600]  Yes, they can't abuse it, but they are electable.
[1:40:32.600 --> 1:40:33.600]  Bill?
[1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:36.720]  The Federal Reserve is not electable, and they abuse it anyway.
[1:40:36.720 --> 1:40:38.400]  Bill, can you hear me?
[1:40:38.400 --> 1:40:39.400]  Yes.
[1:40:39.400 --> 1:40:40.400]  Great.
[1:40:40.400 --> 1:40:43.800]  I just wanted to go back, because you're covering so much, and this is great, exactly
[1:40:43.800 --> 1:40:49.720]  what I'm able to hear and understand, and I meant to get into our current financial
[1:40:49.720 --> 1:40:59.640]  system and the fiat system now, but going back to explain to people, the goldsmiths
[1:40:59.640 --> 1:41:05.960]  to explain fractional reserve banking, let's say they had 1,000 ounces of gold, they soon
[1:41:05.960 --> 1:41:08.600]  learned that people didn't want to carry their gold around with them, they wanted to store
[1:41:08.600 --> 1:41:15.000]  it there in their vault, that they could loan out 5, 10, 20, 30 times in little gold certificates
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:20.360]  to people and then get interest on those, and that people rarely all came at once wanting
[1:41:20.360 --> 1:41:25.760]  their physical gold, so I wanted to go back and explain that and just state that I agree
[1:41:25.760 --> 1:41:33.080]  with you, if we go back on a gold standard, the rich families have dominated and hoarded
[1:41:33.080 --> 1:41:37.200]  the gold to probably one of the greatest vertical integrations we've ever seen, and
[1:41:37.200 --> 1:41:42.280]  that will be a new monopoly that they control, but if we have a transparent monetary reform
[1:41:42.280 --> 1:41:47.120]  and have a fiat system, like with Lincoln, that the bankers killed him over, that then
[1:41:47.120 --> 1:41:52.760]  it makes that artificial input that his currency not be as important anymore, and it does make
[1:41:52.760 --> 1:41:59.240]  goods and services and true trade what society centered around, and then we see our prosperity
[1:41:59.240 --> 1:42:03.440]  explode, so I totally agree with you, it's a historical fact, I just wanted to go back
[1:42:03.440 --> 1:42:08.320]  and ask you and Pat to maybe flesh that out a bit more.
[1:42:08.320 --> 1:42:15.120]  Yeah, well the interest, instead of going into the hands of these families, because
[1:42:15.120 --> 1:42:21.000]  it's a gold back currency, goes into the hands of the general public for the welfare of everyone
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  equally.
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  But let's explain, let's explain.
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:27.440]  The narrator of the film, Pat is, and Pat was the producer of the film.
[1:42:27.440 --> 1:42:28.440]  I understand.
[1:42:28.440 --> 1:42:34.560]  Bill, I understand that we need to also be clear that our current fiat system, the profit
[1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:39.640]  from the interest, basically goes back to the private bank, so they get the power from
[1:42:39.640 --> 1:42:40.640]  the interest as well.
[1:42:40.640 --> 1:42:44.960]  This is their fiat system, people then start debating, because the Federal Reserve and
[1:42:44.960 --> 1:42:49.720]  the private families have a fiat, they then start thinking, well gold must be good, because
[1:42:49.720 --> 1:42:53.720]  it's the opposite of a fiat, I think we need to explain that either way, we don't want
[1:42:53.720 --> 1:42:58.120]  a gold standard or a silver standard under them, and we don't want a fiat system under
[1:42:58.120 --> 1:43:02.760]  them, we want them out of it, then we can have a national debate about what we do want.
[1:43:02.760 --> 1:43:06.880]  That's correct, you understand the problem quite deeply.
[1:43:06.880 --> 1:43:11.480]  We were under a gold system during the Great Depression of the late 20s and 30s, so gold
[1:43:11.480 --> 1:43:13.080]  is not the answer.
[1:43:13.080 --> 1:43:20.760]  Yeah, if you go back a step before you mentioned about the goldsmiths, at that time there was
[1:43:20.760 --> 1:43:25.960]  essentially a gold standard, there were other forms of money, but gold and silver predominated.
[1:43:25.960 --> 1:43:30.320]  Gold, as you mentioned, did not want to carry that around, often if they were engaged in
[1:43:30.320 --> 1:43:34.480]  a large transaction, they couldn't physically carry it around, and so what they did is they
[1:43:34.480 --> 1:43:40.240]  deposited it with the goldsmiths who already had vaults to protect their gold candlesticks
[1:43:40.240 --> 1:43:45.640]  and jewelry and so forth, and they received a receipt from the goldsmith, and so pretty
[1:43:45.640 --> 1:43:50.680]  soon everyone started depositing their gold and silver with the goldsmiths, and they traded
[1:43:50.680 --> 1:43:51.880]  these receipts.
[1:43:51.880 --> 1:43:57.200]  Originally, the owner of the receipt had to go back to the goldsmith and say, write this
[1:43:57.200 --> 1:44:04.160]  out to Bill, but ultimately they became bearer notes, so they could simply be traded between
[1:44:04.160 --> 1:44:07.680]  the individuals, and the gold never left the goldsmiths' vault.
[1:44:07.680 --> 1:44:12.200]  Well, people came into the goldsmiths and wanted to borrow money, and the goldsmiths
[1:44:12.200 --> 1:44:17.040]  had gold of their own, and they also had this other gold that people had deposited there,
[1:44:17.040 --> 1:44:19.960]  and they would loan them these receipts.
[1:44:19.960 --> 1:44:25.120]  But no one did an audit or check to see how much gold was in their vaults, of course,
[1:44:25.120 --> 1:44:29.200]  so the goldsmiths soon learned that because not everyone walked in the same day to cash
[1:44:29.200 --> 1:44:33.760]  in the receipts for gold or silver, in fact very few did, that they could start loaning
[1:44:33.760 --> 1:44:36.960]  more of these out than they actually had gold in deposit.
[1:44:36.960 --> 1:44:41.200]  In fact, they could loan it out on the other people's gold who were unaware it was happening,
[1:44:41.200 --> 1:44:47.240]  and ultimately they could loan it out beyond the quantity of gold and silver they had entirely.
[1:44:47.240 --> 1:44:53.800]  The amount they did this originally back in the 1600s, 15 and 1600s, would be typically
[1:44:53.800 --> 1:45:00.800]  about three to one, up to perhaps five to one, so if they had, for instance, $10,000
[1:45:00.800 --> 1:45:07.120]  in gold in the vault that might loan out $50,000 in these gold receipts in charge, interest
[1:45:07.120 --> 1:45:09.520]  on the ones they had loaned out.
[1:45:09.520 --> 1:45:14.280]  When this was discovered occasionally, when people would find out due to some economic
[1:45:14.280 --> 1:45:19.640]  calamity or some reason the community needed more money and they wanted to go get their
[1:45:19.640 --> 1:45:23.840]  gold and the goldsmith didn't have that much, a number of them were actually hung.
[1:45:23.840 --> 1:45:24.840]  It was against the law.
[1:45:24.840 --> 1:45:25.840]  It was a capital offense.
[1:45:25.840 --> 1:45:26.840]  It was fraud.
[1:45:26.840 --> 1:45:30.360]  Then the goldsmiths amassed great power.
[1:45:30.360 --> 1:45:33.560]  They internationalized so they could run from country to country.
[1:45:33.560 --> 1:45:36.000]  The family split up for safety.
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:39.720]  They developed their own intelligence networks that were the most sophisticated.
[1:45:39.720 --> 1:45:45.880]  They began to pay off local lords and royals for protection from the mob, and then the
[1:45:45.880 --> 1:45:51.400]  corruption began setting in, what would you say, by 16, 1700 or so, to where now they
[1:45:51.400 --> 1:45:57.040]  can go 10 to one, 20 to one, but I guess that digresses, do you guys want to comment on
[1:45:57.040 --> 1:45:58.040]  that?
[1:45:58.040 --> 1:45:59.040]  Well, you're basically correct.
[1:45:59.040 --> 1:46:00.040]  That's right.
[1:46:00.040 --> 1:46:01.040]  The timing's about right.
[1:46:01.040 --> 1:46:09.240]  It reached a national scale where nations, typically it was aristocracy back in the 17th
[1:46:09.240 --> 1:46:13.640]  century, needed to borrow money for various wars.
[1:46:13.640 --> 1:46:20.800]  They would go to the goldsmiths and the goldsmiths would give them, in essence, this fake money.
[1:46:20.800 --> 1:46:25.000]  They formed into corporations called banks, which is simply a word that comes from benches
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:30.160]  where these transactions took place in Italy in earlier days, but essentially they were
[1:46:30.160 --> 1:46:34.800]  just corporate bodies or groups of these people, these goldsmiths, who grouped together
[1:46:34.800 --> 1:46:37.360]  and loaned the money to the governments.
[1:46:37.360 --> 1:46:42.040]  The government's been paid interest on it, and so wealth became more and more concentrated
[1:46:42.040 --> 1:46:48.080]  and you're right, they used this money to corrupt the political system.
[1:46:48.080 --> 1:46:51.280]  And then pretty soon it didn't matter if they cheated, nobody got in trouble, and they would
[1:46:51.280 --> 1:46:57.280]  just send out the guard to attack the small middle classes when they got ripped off, just
[1:46:57.280 --> 1:46:58.280]  absolutely amazing.
[1:46:58.280 --> 1:46:59.520]  Well, please continue.
[1:46:59.520 --> 1:47:03.160]  This is riveting information for people, and for those that don't know, that's who the
[1:47:03.160 --> 1:47:08.600]  New World Order is, is it's basically an amalgamation of European royalty with the goldsmiths who
[1:47:08.600 --> 1:47:12.080]  have all intermarried, and they now own the planet.
[1:47:12.080 --> 1:47:18.720]  Yeah, by 1668 the Reichsbank in Sweden, which was privately owned, was loaning money that
[1:47:18.720 --> 1:47:24.280]  they created to the government of Sweden, but they didn't actually create the national
[1:47:24.280 --> 1:47:25.280]  currency.
[1:47:25.280 --> 1:47:30.960]  That happened when bankers in Amsterdam financed the Glorious Revolution, which was when William
[1:47:30.960 --> 1:47:35.680]  III and Mary invaded England over through the stewards and so forth.
[1:47:35.680 --> 1:47:39.040]  Payback was they were allowed to create the Bank of England, which was privately owned
[1:47:39.040 --> 1:47:43.600]  until World War II when it was nationalized.
[1:47:43.600 --> 1:47:49.320]  And the Bank of England, which most Englishmen assumed was a government entity, was in fact
[1:47:49.320 --> 1:47:53.720]  privately owned, and the Bank of England created money out of nothing.
[1:47:53.720 --> 1:47:57.680]  It loaned it to the British government, which used it to expand the empire.
[1:47:57.680 --> 1:47:59.360]  The interest was paid through taxes.
[1:47:59.360 --> 1:48:03.360]  The taxes were put on the common man, and there you had the transfer of wealth from
[1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:10.280]  the common man to the bankers, and the growth of the empire, which required massive borrowing
[1:48:10.280 --> 1:48:14.880]  by the government, actually facilitated this transfer of wealth to the bankers.
[1:48:14.880 --> 1:48:19.800]  So you can see where imperialism becomes something that the bankers desire and actively
[1:48:19.800 --> 1:48:23.000]  promote, and wars as well, because it's part of it.
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:33.640]  They're very expensive, government borrows the money for wars, and the bankers profit.
[1:48:33.640 --> 1:48:39.240]  That brings us up to the, after the Bank of England, we had essentially the same process
[1:48:39.240 --> 1:48:43.040]  take place in the United States.
[1:48:43.040 --> 1:48:49.520]  In the colonial days, the Bank of England was providing the money, the paper money,
[1:48:49.520 --> 1:48:56.400]  and the colonies, the colonists didn't like that, and they began to create their own money
[1:48:56.400 --> 1:49:02.840]  called Colonial Script, and Bill, do you want to talk about the script a bit?
[1:49:02.840 --> 1:49:09.200]  Well, yeah, and in fact, Benjamin Franklin was a big supporter of the United States
[1:49:09.200 --> 1:49:11.520]  creating its own money.
[1:49:11.520 --> 1:49:21.360]  When he was ambassador to England, he was talking to the officials from the Bank of
[1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:24.000]  England, and they asked him, why is America so rich?
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:28.240]  And Franklin said, that's easy, because in America we create our own money and have
[1:49:28.240 --> 1:49:30.080]  no interest to pay to no one.
[1:49:30.080 --> 1:49:35.720]  Well, the Bank of England quickly put it into that by passing the Currency Act, and
[1:49:35.720 --> 1:49:36.720]  what did that do?
[1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:42.080]  They outlawed American paper money, because America, there wasn't much gold in America,
[1:49:42.080 --> 1:49:45.480]  but there was a thriving economy.
[1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:51.200]  They outlawed American paper money and put America onto the gold standard, forcing payment
[1:49:51.200 --> 1:49:55.560]  only in gold coins, so that created a tremendous depression.
[1:49:55.560 --> 1:50:00.680]  It would be just like, if you had a bunch of paper money in your wallet, and somebody
[1:50:00.680 --> 1:50:06.280]  outlawed the paper money in your wallet and said you had to have bluebird feathers to
[1:50:06.280 --> 1:50:07.280]  pay.
[1:50:07.280 --> 1:50:08.760]  And the country almost fell apart.
[1:50:08.760 --> 1:50:10.920]  Well, you'd be in bad shape.
[1:50:10.920 --> 1:50:17.800]  Well, in any case, Franklin later said that this depression that set in as a result of
[1:50:17.800 --> 1:50:23.880]  America being forced back onto a gold standard was really the root cause of the American
[1:50:23.880 --> 1:50:28.840]  Revolution, just an astonishing fact when you understand the implications.
[1:50:28.840 --> 1:50:34.120]  Yeah, everything revolves around this, your whole lives, your financial future, your entire

[1:53:48.080 --> 1:53:56.880]  American Revolution.
[1:53:56.880 --> 1:54:20.480]  We lived in complete bondage financially since 1913.
[1:54:20.480 --> 1:54:23.720]  Our presidents all fought against the bankers.
[1:54:23.720 --> 1:54:27.560]  Many were assassinated over it.
[1:54:27.560 --> 1:54:34.560]  Others had attempted murder committed against them like Andrew Jackson.
[1:54:34.560 --> 1:54:40.080]  Every American understood the private bankers, the goldsmiths, how the scam worked.
[1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:45.200]  Even when everyone knew we fell to them in 1913 through trickery.
[1:54:45.200 --> 1:54:48.240]  The bankers came out against the Federal Reserve and that ruse fooled everyone even though
[1:54:48.240 --> 1:54:49.720]  they'd secretly authored it.
[1:54:49.720 --> 1:54:50.720]  The film covers it all.
[1:54:50.720 --> 1:54:53.800]  The moneyman is available at infowars.com.
[1:54:53.800 --> 1:54:59.200]  Your friends, your family, your neighbors, your pastor, your schoolteachers, professors,
[1:54:59.200 --> 1:55:04.080]  they don't know and we're not going to turn around what's happening in this society unless
[1:55:04.080 --> 1:55:05.080]  we do.
[1:55:05.080 --> 1:55:09.680]  The bankers are raping us, squeezing us, laughing at us, engineering everything you're seeing
[1:55:09.680 --> 1:55:10.680]  right now.
[1:55:10.680 --> 1:55:15.480]  I tell you, the time has flown by, they're with us for another 40 minutes or so and I
[1:55:15.480 --> 1:55:19.800]  got to have them up for two, three hours in the future to take calls as the producer,
[1:55:19.800 --> 1:55:24.680]  one of the leading experts out there on the situation, Pat Carmack and of course the fellow
[1:55:24.680 --> 1:55:29.480]  that is in the film, travel around and of course narrates it.
[1:55:29.480 --> 1:55:33.800]  All over the world, Bill Still is our guest as well.
[1:55:33.800 --> 1:55:38.000]  Gentlemen, please continue breaking down what we're facing, the basic history of this.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:40.280]  I think a good place, you were talking about American history.
[1:55:40.280 --> 1:55:42.920]  Tell folks about old Andrew Jackson for don't know.
[1:55:42.920 --> 1:55:47.120]  I mean, on his deathbed, he said at the harmitage, of all the things you've done in your life,
[1:55:47.120 --> 1:55:48.200]  what are you most proud of?
[1:55:48.200 --> 1:55:54.480]  This was an incredible person whose life is more unbelievable than a fictional character,
[1:55:54.480 --> 1:55:55.480]  like Rambo.
[1:55:55.480 --> 1:56:01.640]  I mean, he made Davey Crockett Palin's significance, but he was more proud of, quote, killing the
[1:56:01.640 --> 1:56:02.640]  bank.
[1:56:02.640 --> 1:56:10.680]  If I could say jump before then a little bit, the very root of our problem was correctly
[1:56:10.680 --> 1:56:14.160]  identified by Thomas Jefferson.
[1:56:14.160 --> 1:56:18.880]  He put it this way, if the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue
[1:56:18.880 --> 1:56:25.240]  of their currency, which is of course a situation today, first by inflation, then by deflation,
[1:56:25.240 --> 1:56:30.040]  the banks and corporations which grow up around them will deprive the people of all
[1:56:30.040 --> 1:56:36.880]  property until their children wake up homeless on the continent, their fathers conquered.
[1:56:36.880 --> 1:56:43.280]  And that's exactly the situation we see going on this year, 2008.
[1:56:43.280 --> 1:56:47.280]  And nothing, there is only one solution to this.
[1:56:47.280 --> 1:56:51.360]  They can't, no amount of money they pump into the system through their various guises is
[1:56:51.360 --> 1:56:52.360]  going to work.
[1:56:52.360 --> 1:56:54.880]  None of this is going to work.
[1:56:54.880 --> 1:57:01.720]  Only one thing will work, and that's monetary reform as per the bill that Pat Carmack has
[1:57:01.720 --> 1:57:02.720]  authored.
[1:57:02.720 --> 1:57:05.760]  We're going to spend time on that at the end, but now I want to continue with who the enemy
[1:57:05.760 --> 1:57:08.880]  is because they have to understand how the system works.
[1:57:08.880 --> 1:57:13.720]  Great families who have unlimited liquidity, they can buy anybody and anything, people
[1:57:13.720 --> 1:57:19.480]  will kill their mothers for this fiat currency and what we're getting is bondage.
[1:57:19.480 --> 1:57:20.480]  Andrew Jackson.
[1:57:20.480 --> 1:57:27.560]  Well, if we, Andrew Jackson fought the second bank, pardon me, the first bank of the United
[1:57:27.560 --> 1:57:32.640]  States and then the second bank of the United States when he was president, if we step back
[1:57:32.640 --> 1:57:38.000]  just a couple of years after the revolution dealt it, you know, blow to the bank of England
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:41.600]  and the United States was free to create their own money.
[1:57:41.600 --> 1:57:45.960]  Right away, the European bankers tried to finance a replacement in this country called
[1:57:45.960 --> 1:57:51.000]  the Bank of North America, and we go into this history in the video, but very briefly
[1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:57.200]  it lasted from 1781 to 1785 when it was killed.
[1:57:57.200 --> 1:58:03.120]  It was succeeded by another attempt called the first bank of the United States, and this
[1:58:03.120 --> 1:58:05.120]  one was killed in 1811.
[1:58:05.120 --> 1:58:10.280]  Oh, stay there, got a break for 70 seconds, right back to both of you, and we're talking
[1:58:10.280 --> 1:58:13.800]  to the makers of the incredible film, The Money Masters.
[1:58:13.800 --> 1:58:20.440]  You need to get it today, folks, it's so vital, infowars.com, because this shapes our entire
[1:58:20.440 --> 1:58:23.000]  history and who we are today.
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:32.280]  All right, this is the central issue, we'll be right back.
[1:58:32.280 --> 1:58:34.760]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:58:34.760 --> 1:58:37.840]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:37.840 --> 1:58:41.760]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[1:58:41.760 --> 1:58:44.760]  I've come with a message of information.
[1:58:44.760 --> 1:58:47.760]  9-11 was an inside job.
[1:58:47.760 --> 1:58:48.760]  You like being a puppet, sir?
[1:58:48.760 --> 1:58:50.360]  You like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[1:58:50.360 --> 1:58:53.440]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[1:58:53.440 --> 1:58:57.760]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.A.F.R.?
[1:58:57.760 --> 1:59:05.040]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of just
[1:59:05.040 --> 1:59:06.760]  patissim to grow at our own door.
[1:59:06.760 --> 1:59:12.760]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:59:12.760 --> 1:59:15.400]  An inside job?
[1:59:15.400 --> 1:59:16.400]  How dare you?
[1:59:16.400 --> 1:59:18.920]  I don't think that the public is just in a job, it's 9-11.
[1:59:18.920 --> 1:59:22.760]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:59:22.760 --> 1:59:25.760]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:59:25.760 --> 1:59:30.760]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th
[1:59:30.760 --> 1:59:31.760]  anniversary of 9-11.
[1:59:31.760 --> 1:59:32.760]  Truth rising.
[1:59:32.760 --> 1:59:36.760]  Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:59:36.760 --> 2:00:04.760]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[2:00:04.760 --> 2:00:08.760]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:08.760 --> 2:00:13.760]  We have the man who traveled the world and narrated and presented the incredible film,
[2:00:13.760 --> 2:00:18.760]  The Money Masters, Bill Still, and we have the man who produced and directed it, Pat
[2:00:18.760 --> 2:00:23.760]  Carmack, on the line, had recognized one of the leading experts on the private run-for-profit
[2:00:23.760 --> 2:00:24.760]  Federal Reserve.
[2:00:24.760 --> 2:00:29.760]  I already knew he was one of the top experts out there, but I just love it and feel like
[2:00:29.760 --> 2:00:30.760]  I know Bill Still.
[2:00:30.760 --> 2:00:34.760]  Even though it's the first time we've personally talked because of seeing his film, I don't
[2:00:34.760 --> 2:00:40.760]  know, five or six times when locals here aired it on TV over and over again back in the late
[2:00:40.760 --> 2:00:41.760]  1990s.
[2:00:41.760 --> 2:00:44.760]  And I already knew a lot about the Federal Reserve, but they let it out so well.
[2:00:44.760 --> 2:00:49.760]  I mean, I loved Javelin Griffin's film, Creature from Jekyll Island, but that's more one-dimensional.
[2:00:49.760 --> 2:00:52.760]  This is three-dimensional and so important.
[2:00:52.760 --> 2:00:55.760]  Okay, we've gotten up to Andrew Jackson.
[2:00:55.760 --> 2:01:01.760]  I mean, Americans don't know the struggles we've had and that we had 10, 11, 12 percent
[2:01:01.760 --> 2:01:09.760]  growth rates previously, zero inflation until the bankers take over in 1913, but going back
[2:01:09.760 --> 2:01:12.760]  to the 1830s and Andrew Jackson.
[2:01:12.760 --> 2:01:21.760]  Well, if you step back to Hamilton and Washington, Washington was not a financial expert, obviously.
[2:01:21.760 --> 2:01:27.760]  He was a terrific first president, founder, but Hamilton pushed the idea of the private
[2:01:27.760 --> 2:01:28.760]  banks.
[2:01:28.760 --> 2:01:31.760]  He was connected to European financial powers.
[2:01:31.760 --> 2:01:38.760]  And you had opposed to him Jefferson, Monroe, Adams, almost everybody, but because of the
[2:01:38.760 --> 2:01:42.760]  needs of the government in Washington, he didn't side with Jefferson.
[2:01:42.760 --> 2:01:45.760]  He sided with Hamilton because he just didn't understand it.
[2:01:45.760 --> 2:01:47.760]  And there was a lot of ignorance about it at that time.
[2:01:47.760 --> 2:01:50.760]  There were internal struggles within the government.
[2:01:50.760 --> 2:01:51.760]  That's right.
[2:01:51.760 --> 2:01:56.760]  And Hamilton's view prevailed briefly with the first bank of the United States.
[2:01:56.760 --> 2:01:58.760]  It had a 20-year charter.
[2:01:58.760 --> 2:02:06.760]  When it expired in 1811, there was an attempt to restore the charter and that was defeated.
[2:02:06.760 --> 2:02:14.760]  Again, in 1816, the second bank of the United States, which is very similar to the Fed,
[2:02:14.760 --> 2:02:19.760]  and again, it gives us private money creation power out of the government into private hands
[2:02:19.760 --> 2:02:21.760]  that these banks were owned by private stock.
[2:02:21.760 --> 2:02:26.760]  That'd be like if I called my business a federal government bookstore and just claimed I was
[2:02:26.760 --> 2:02:28.760]  a federal government selling books.
[2:02:28.760 --> 2:02:30.760]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[2:02:30.760 --> 2:02:31.760]  Right.
[2:02:31.760 --> 2:02:36.760]  And so the second bank of the United States, chartered in 1816, was the one Andrew Jackson
[2:02:36.760 --> 2:02:38.760]  fought against.
[2:02:38.760 --> 2:02:43.760]  He fought to have the charter defeated and not renewed.
[2:02:43.760 --> 2:02:45.760]  He was ultimately successful.
[2:02:45.760 --> 2:02:49.760]  In the whole process, there was an assassination attempt against him.
[2:02:49.760 --> 2:02:53.760]  Both guns misfired, so he was spared.
[2:02:53.760 --> 2:02:54.760]  And that's amazing.
[2:02:54.760 --> 2:02:56.760]  I mean, is that not Providence?
[2:02:56.760 --> 2:02:58.760]  Well, it is, of course.
[2:02:58.760 --> 2:03:04.760]  The United States was spared falling under the control of bankers at that time.
[2:03:04.760 --> 2:03:10.760]  So we had kind of a free laissez-faire banking situation until the Civil War and there was
[2:03:10.760 --> 2:03:13.760]  tremendous prosperity and growth in the country.
[2:03:13.760 --> 2:03:20.760]  And that was, with very few exceptions in that period, that was basically the situation until
[2:03:20.760 --> 2:03:26.760]  the middle of the Civil War when Lincoln needed money to finance the war effort.
[2:03:26.760 --> 2:03:32.760]  He got Congress to provide it initially by simply issuing money called greenbacks because
[2:03:32.760 --> 2:03:36.760]  the back of them was printed with green ink, but it was just U.S. notes.
[2:03:36.760 --> 2:03:40.760]  So there were government notes that were used to pay bills, to pay soldiers, to pay for
[2:03:40.760 --> 2:03:42.760]  ammunition, and so forth.
[2:03:42.760 --> 2:03:46.760]  But the European bankers had saddled up to him, sidled up to him, and tried to get him
[2:03:46.760 --> 2:03:50.760]  into debt, and he said no, and they just pulled their hair out with rage.
[2:03:50.760 --> 2:03:54.760]  Meanwhile, they were funding the South trying to break the country up.
[2:03:54.760 --> 2:03:55.760]  That's right.
[2:03:55.760 --> 2:03:59.760]  It's not uncommon for major bankers to fund both sides in a war because they're after
[2:03:59.760 --> 2:04:02.760]  primarily profits, unfortunately.
[2:04:02.760 --> 2:04:09.760]  So Congress eventually was, it was initially supported Lincoln and these U.S.
[2:04:09.760 --> 2:04:14.760]  notes, which he had about 400 million issued at that time, which colossal amount of money
[2:04:14.760 --> 2:04:19.760]  to finance the war, but then Congress turned against him as the bankers financed politicians
[2:04:19.760 --> 2:04:22.760]  who were not in favor of these U.S. notes.
[2:04:22.760 --> 2:04:30.760]  So Lincoln had to compromise, I think it was in 1863, and in order to get more of these
[2:04:30.760 --> 2:04:38.760]  U.S. notes, he had to reestablish the central banking system through the National Banking
[2:04:38.760 --> 2:04:39.760]  Act.
[2:04:39.760 --> 2:04:40.760]  We'll take it from there when we get back.
[2:04:40.760 --> 2:04:44.760]  Long segment coming up with both of our amazing guests, prisonplanet.com.

[2:05:47.760 --> 2:05:50.760]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[2:05:50.760 --> 2:05:55.760]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes and more?
[2:05:55.760 --> 2:05:59.760]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients.
[2:05:59.760 --> 2:06:01.760]  Most of which are synthetic.
[2:06:01.760 --> 2:06:02.760]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[2:06:02.760 --> 2:06:07.760]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing,
[2:06:07.760 --> 2:06:12.760]  wheezing and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin and mucous membranes.
[2:06:12.760 --> 2:06:14.760]  Now compare a cow and pure soap.
[2:06:14.760 --> 2:06:18.760]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[2:06:46.760 --> 2:06:53.760]  Here I am at a gathering of friends minding my own business when one of our buddies, Bob, walks up to me very concerned.
[2:06:53.760 --> 2:06:56.760]  He says, wow, have you seen the gasoline prices lately?
[2:06:56.760 --> 2:06:57.760]  I said, oh, of course.
[2:06:57.760 --> 2:06:58.760]  Whoo, they're high.
[2:06:58.760 --> 2:07:00.760]  He says, yeah, he says, what am I going to do?
[2:07:00.760 --> 2:07:01.760]  I've got a truck.
[2:07:01.760 --> 2:07:03.760]  There's no way anybody's going to buy my truck in this market.
[2:07:03.760 --> 2:07:05.760]  I really need the truck for my job.
[2:07:05.760 --> 2:07:07.760]  It uses more gas than I can afford.
[2:07:07.760 --> 2:07:09.760]  I've got to find a way to come up with some extra money.
[2:07:09.760 --> 2:07:11.760]  I got a wife with four kids at home.
[2:07:11.760 --> 2:07:12.760]  I don't know what to do.
[2:07:12.760 --> 2:07:13.760]  I said, Bob, relax.
[2:07:13.760 --> 2:07:14.760]  I know what to do.
[2:07:14.760 --> 2:07:18.760]  Call efoodsdirect.com or go up on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[2:07:18.760 --> 2:07:29.760]  They will deliver food, really good, high quality, nutritional, delicious food to your door, your door now right there in front of your house for about half the price that you were paying for groceries last year.

[2:07:37.760 --> 2:07:38.760]  Why don't you do that, Bob?
[2:07:38.760 --> 2:07:46.760]  He said efoodsdirect.com. I said, yep, call him at 1-800-409-5633. That's 800-409-5633. Do it now.
[2:07:47.760 --> 2:07:50.760]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[2:07:50.760 --> 2:07:53.760]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:07:58.760 --> 2:08:00.760]  Bob Carmack, the maker.
[2:08:02.760 --> 2:08:05.760]  Have an amazing film, The Money Masters.
[2:08:05.760 --> 2:08:11.760]  I can think of no film overall that is more central to our entire world.
[2:08:11.760 --> 2:08:12.760]  They are the great architects.
[2:08:12.760 --> 2:08:14.760]  They took control of the world through fraud.
[2:08:14.760 --> 2:08:20.760]  They have steered our societal development for 100 years at least in the western world.
[2:08:20.760 --> 2:08:23.760]  They had almost complete domination in England 200 years ago.
[2:08:23.760 --> 2:08:31.760]  And of course we skipped over how they ran the scam with Napoleon saying he'd won to make them run on the banks and then buy it all up.
[2:08:31.760 --> 2:08:35.760]  I mean, there's so much to talk about and I want to spend some time on monetary reform.
[2:08:35.760 --> 2:08:41.760]  The problem is when you've got a general public that really thinks there's no oil because of peak oil,
[2:08:41.760 --> 2:08:45.760]  the media tells them there's no more oil, that's why they're paying more, not that the dollar's been devalued.
[2:08:45.760 --> 2:08:49.760]  When you've got a public that doesn't even know what dollar devaluation means,
[2:08:49.760 --> 2:08:54.760]  what currency inflation means, what hyperinflation means, and I'm not being sardonic.
[2:08:54.760 --> 2:08:55.760]  I'm not even that smart.
[2:08:55.760 --> 2:08:56.760]  I mean, I want to make that clear.
[2:08:56.760 --> 2:09:01.760]  It's so obvious our whole history is struggling against these people.
[2:09:01.760 --> 2:09:04.760]  And you brought us up to the Civil War.
[2:09:04.760 --> 2:09:08.760]  Please continue, Pat and Bill.
[2:09:08.760 --> 2:09:12.760]  Well, if I could just insert a quote by Otto von Bismarck,
[2:09:12.760 --> 2:09:15.760]  just shortly after the Lincoln era.
[2:09:15.760 --> 2:09:19.760]  Bismarck, of course, was chancellor of Germany.
[2:09:19.760 --> 2:09:22.760]  He put it this way, quote,
[2:09:22.760 --> 2:09:27.760]  not to be doubted, I know of absolute certainty that the division of the United States
[2:09:27.760 --> 2:09:31.760]  into two federations of equal force was decided long before the Civil War
[2:09:31.760 --> 2:09:34.760]  by the high financial powers of Europe.
[2:09:34.760 --> 2:09:38.760]  These bankers were afraid that the United States, if they remained as one block
[2:09:38.760 --> 2:09:43.760]  and were to develop as one nation, would attain economic and financial independence,
[2:09:43.760 --> 2:09:47.760]  which would upset the capitalist domination of Europe over the world.
[2:09:47.760 --> 2:09:52.760]  And also, something else Pat neglected to mention was,
[2:09:52.760 --> 2:10:00.760]  and I'll let him speak to it because he has more facts at the tip of his fingers than I do,
[2:10:00.760 --> 2:10:09.760]  and that's the result of the United States not rechartering the first bank in the United States in 1811,
[2:10:09.760 --> 2:10:14.760]  was the British threatened to invade the country if the bank was not rechartered.
[2:10:14.760 --> 2:10:20.760]  And of course, the recharter bill did not pass Congress and the British did invade,
[2:10:20.760 --> 2:10:24.760]  and that was the absolute root cause of the war of 1812.
[2:10:24.760 --> 2:10:25.760]  Let me stop you.
[2:10:25.760 --> 2:10:28.760]  The IMF and World Bank, their documents have come out.
[2:10:28.760 --> 2:10:31.760]  That's why Serbia was attacked. They had their own bank.
[2:10:31.760 --> 2:10:35.760]  That's why Iraq got set up and told to invade Kuwait and then blown to bits
[2:10:35.760 --> 2:10:38.760]  because they wouldn't allow the central banks to come in and take over.
[2:10:38.760 --> 2:10:43.760]  Every rogue nation on the PNAC list is a country that isn't dominated
[2:10:43.760 --> 2:10:45.760]  by the private central banks.
[2:10:45.760 --> 2:10:49.760]  So this is a hive borg that took us over a long time ago. Go ahead.
[2:10:49.760 --> 2:10:53.760]  Yeah. In fact, on that point, if people are interested,
[2:10:53.760 --> 2:11:00.760]  they can go to the IMF annual reports and there's a chart that's in each one.
[2:11:00.760 --> 2:11:03.760]  It's called the Nations in a Rears.
[2:11:03.760 --> 2:11:10.760]  And the Nations in a Rears almost invariably are those that are either invaded.
[2:11:10.760 --> 2:11:13.760]  There's a coup. They're bombed.
[2:11:13.760 --> 2:11:18.760]  If any nation that has things like that happen to them are one of those Nations in a Rears,
[2:11:18.760 --> 2:11:20.760]  it's an effective collection effort.
[2:11:20.760 --> 2:11:25.760]  And it's to get them in line with the fractional reserve banking system of the West.
[2:11:25.760 --> 2:11:29.760]  But to go back to Lincoln and bring it up rather quickly,
[2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:33.760]  he had to compromise with the New York bankers at that time.
[2:11:33.760 --> 2:11:36.760]  So he passed the National Banking Act of 1863 and then 1864.
[2:11:36.760 --> 2:11:41.760]  This restored much of the power, not all, and it was decentralized to the banks
[2:11:41.760 --> 2:11:44.760]  so they could create money, but it was limited.
[2:11:44.760 --> 2:11:46.760]  That situation prevailed.
[2:11:46.760 --> 2:11:50.760]  And I'll skip through some of the minor things that happened in the interim,
[2:11:50.760 --> 2:11:53.760]  but prevailed until the 20th century.
[2:11:53.760 --> 2:12:02.760]  In 1907, there was an artificial panic created by the J.P. Morgan interest in New York City,
[2:12:02.760 --> 2:12:07.760]  which resulted in the bankruptcy of some of the local banks in New York City.
[2:12:07.760 --> 2:12:11.760]  And there was a call that they financed for bank reform.
[2:12:11.760 --> 2:12:15.760]  And this was, of course, engineered by them.
[2:12:15.760 --> 2:12:21.760]  And the bank reform they wanted was the restoration of a national central bank privately owned.
[2:12:21.760 --> 2:12:25.760]  And ultimately, to cut that history a little short,
[2:12:25.760 --> 2:12:31.760]  it resulted in passage in 1913 under Woodrow Wilson of the Federal Reserve Act.
[2:12:31.760 --> 2:12:35.760]  For those that don't know, I don't want to cut this too short because it's so central.
[2:12:35.760 --> 2:12:38.760]  They ran all these big newspaper articles saying,
[2:12:38.760 --> 2:12:43.760]  oh, it's horrible, don't pass the Federal Reserve Act, J.P. Morgan and the Rockefellers,
[2:12:43.760 --> 2:12:46.760]  and oh my gosh, it's just so evil, don't do it.
[2:12:46.760 --> 2:12:51.760]  And that fooled the public into supporting it, but still there wasn't enough support.
[2:12:51.760 --> 2:12:57.760]  So they passed it in the dead of night a few days before Christmas, as they always do.
[2:12:57.760 --> 2:13:01.760]  And then they had their Duke Woodrow Wilson before they poisoned him on the train,
[2:13:01.760 --> 2:13:05.760]  who wrote letters saying, I've been scammed, it's a private takeover.
[2:13:05.760 --> 2:13:07.760]  The New World Order is bad.
[2:13:07.760 --> 2:13:10.760]  You know, it's a British aristocracy takeover.
[2:13:10.760 --> 2:13:12.760]  And that's all in the history.
[2:13:12.760 --> 2:13:18.760]  But again, we have a public who doesn't even know what a continent is or who the vice president is.
[2:13:18.760 --> 2:13:20.760]  So how are they going to know about all this?
[2:13:20.760 --> 2:13:28.760]  Well, that's right. Teddy Roosevelt and Taft were both financed in part by bankers,
[2:13:28.760 --> 2:13:31.760]  hoping they would support a central banking act.
[2:13:31.760 --> 2:13:33.760]  They didn't. They both opposed it.
[2:13:33.760 --> 2:13:36.760]  And that's why they had to get a Democrat in.
[2:13:36.760 --> 2:13:43.760]  Of course, William Jennings Bryant had opposed it most dramatically in his cross of gold speech.
[2:13:43.760 --> 2:13:51.760]  But Bryant failed to get elected president and the bankers financed this unknown Woodrow Wilson.
[2:13:51.760 --> 2:13:53.760]  He was the president of Princeton.
[2:13:53.760 --> 2:13:55.760]  I want to stop you again.
[2:13:55.760 --> 2:14:02.760]  We've gone from every newspaper, every president, everyone knowing huge debates to it's a conspiracy theory.
[2:14:02.760 --> 2:14:05.760]  The Federal Reserve isn't private. Everything's wonderful.
[2:14:05.760 --> 2:14:07.760]  Yeah, that's a really good point, Alex.
[2:14:07.760 --> 2:14:13.760]  The public at that time was very well informed. Most of the leading politicians were.
[2:14:13.760 --> 2:14:19.760]  They had to find ignorant ones, which wasn't easy to raise up in order to use them to get their bills passed.
[2:14:19.760 --> 2:14:23.760]  And Wilson was one of them. He was totally ignorant on economics.
[2:14:23.760 --> 2:14:27.760]  He was a schooled in it by agents for the bankers.
[2:14:27.760 --> 2:14:32.760]  And he ultimately signed a Federal Reserve act, which he later deeply regretted when he understood what he had done.
[2:14:32.760 --> 2:14:35.760]  Edward Mandel House, from right here in Austin, Texas.
[2:14:35.760 --> 2:14:39.760]  That's right. House was told him to support the act.
[2:14:39.760 --> 2:14:44.760]  Some of the senators who passed it. In fact, they couldn't find anybody who'd read the thing.
[2:14:44.760 --> 2:14:49.760]  And it was passed, as you said, during the Christmas break.
[2:14:49.760 --> 2:14:53.760]  There is a mythology on it that really didn't have enough votes and so forth it did.
[2:14:53.760 --> 2:14:58.760]  But it was done when many of the senators and representatives were gone.
[2:14:58.760 --> 2:15:03.760]  I think it was signed on Christmas Day, in fact, by Wilson.
[2:15:03.760 --> 2:15:06.760]  And so it became the law of the land.
[2:15:06.760 --> 2:15:11.760]  Whether or not there's legal flaws enough to attack is another argument, and there probably are.
[2:15:11.760 --> 2:15:17.760]  But nonetheless, it is the present law and it allows bankers, private banks, to create money.
[2:15:17.760 --> 2:15:23.760]  And the mechanism for that we can go into here and it's probably a good place to do it.
[2:15:23.760 --> 2:15:29.760]  And now they can crony whoever they like. They can use their own loans to buy up all the industries, assets, governments.
[2:15:29.760 --> 2:15:33.760]  And now I want to get to what they're currently doing to us today.
[2:15:33.760 --> 2:15:37.760]  And we can go through the National Security Act and how they built the police state apparatus
[2:15:37.760 --> 2:15:41.760]  or the federally-chartered state police and how we're all federalized now.
[2:15:41.760 --> 2:15:47.760]  But these criminals, if they're fully going to social engineers and really turn us into chattel slaves physically,
[2:15:47.760 --> 2:15:54.760]  not just financially, they've got to have a police state mechanism in place to make sure we don't ever,
[2:15:54.760 --> 2:16:01.760]  if we ever do find out, put them in prison for their crimes. So now we have the police state grid and the prisons in place.
[2:16:01.760 --> 2:16:09.760]  And now they're bringing us down to the final, taking us from any semblance of a free market into a new feudal state.
[2:16:09.760 --> 2:16:15.760]  Well, you know, there's two arguments on that. One of them is that, you know, the best form of slavery
[2:16:15.760 --> 2:16:21.760]  are slaves who want their slavery, who desire it and don't really even know what freedom is or seek it.
[2:16:21.760 --> 2:16:27.760]  And that's accomplished, you know, in history through ignorance, you know, through making sure that people aren't educated,
[2:16:27.760 --> 2:16:28.760]  don't understand.
[2:16:28.760 --> 2:16:29.760]  And through debt, you know.
[2:16:29.760 --> 2:16:31.760]  And through debt, that's certainly the case.
[2:16:31.760 --> 2:16:39.760]  And so we've seen the middle class, for instance, disappear since about 1971 at the rate of about 1% per year.
[2:16:39.760 --> 2:16:45.760]  And so the average Americans considerably worse off financially to the point where, now,
[2:16:45.760 --> 2:16:50.760]  when the average American retires at about age 65 or when they used to retire at age 65,
[2:16:50.760 --> 2:16:52.760]  they have zero net wealth.
[2:16:52.760 --> 2:16:59.760]  Now, 100 years ago at around 1900, typically, an American family owned a farm debt-free.
[2:16:59.760 --> 2:17:03.760]  So they had a means of production, they had no debt, and they were independent.
[2:17:03.760 --> 2:17:05.760]  And they had independent thought.
[2:17:05.760 --> 2:17:10.760]  In 100 years, that's reversed as we've urbanized and people have gone further into debt through the,
[2:17:10.760 --> 2:17:14.760]  from the National, from the Federal Reserve Act, the consequences of it.
[2:17:14.760 --> 2:17:19.760]  So now the average American at 65 owns nothing, which is incredible.
[2:17:19.760 --> 2:17:25.760]  And they're systematically changing laws to shut down the family farms and ranches.
[2:17:25.760 --> 2:17:30.760]  The Tyson chickens don't have to have tracker chips, but everybody else is due to shut them down.
[2:17:30.760 --> 2:17:33.760]  I mean, it's all happening now.
[2:17:33.760 --> 2:17:38.760]  Yeah, and the nature of the system is that there's never enough money for the populace
[2:17:38.760 --> 2:17:41.760]  so that increasingly people have to go into debt.
[2:17:41.760 --> 2:17:47.760]  And because all of our money is created out of debt, it's a debt money system.
[2:17:47.760 --> 2:17:54.760]  And so how that's actually accomplished is typically what happens in this country.
[2:17:54.760 --> 2:18:00.760]  Let's take, for instance, a year like the current one, where the deficits exceed $400 billion.
[2:18:00.760 --> 2:18:02.760]  Well, where does the government get that?
[2:18:02.760 --> 2:18:08.760]  If they don't raise taxes and they haven't sufficiently to do that, then they have to borrow it.
[2:18:08.760 --> 2:18:11.760]  If they borrowed $400 billion on the credit markets, it collapsed the economy
[2:18:11.760 --> 2:18:16.760]  because there'd be no money for anything else, no money to finance industry or house buying or anything.
[2:18:16.760 --> 2:18:23.760]  So what they do is the Federal Reserve, in the case using an example of needing $400 billion,
[2:18:23.760 --> 2:18:31.760]  the government needing to borrow that, the Federal Reserve steps in and buys $40 billion,
[2:18:31.760 --> 2:18:35.760]  or 10% of the amount needed of government bonds.
[2:18:35.760 --> 2:18:39.760]  Or lately they've used it for other purposes, but typically for government bonds.
[2:18:39.760 --> 2:18:41.760]  So where do they get that $40 billion?
[2:18:41.760 --> 2:18:43.760]  Well, the Fed creates it out of nothing.
[2:18:43.760 --> 2:18:48.760]  It's on a keyboard, that money's transferred to the banks of the sellers of those bonds.
[2:18:48.760 --> 2:18:52.760]  That could be you or me or anybody that owns a government bond, T-bill, so forth.
[2:18:52.760 --> 2:18:53.760]  So they buy those.
[2:18:53.760 --> 2:18:56.760]  So that $40 billion goes into those banks.
[2:18:56.760 --> 2:19:02.760]  Those banks now, through the Fractional Reserve Banking, can loan out 90% of that money.
[2:19:02.760 --> 2:19:05.760]  So a $40 billion, they can loan out $36 billion.
[2:19:05.760 --> 2:19:10.760]  And then they create subsidiaries and leverage it out again to the power of infinity.
[2:19:10.760 --> 2:19:11.760]  Sure.
[2:19:11.760 --> 2:19:15.760]  And if you don't like it, a SWAT team will drop by and kill you.
[2:19:15.760 --> 2:19:16.760]  Gentlemen, we've got a break.
[2:19:16.760 --> 2:19:19.760]  When we come back, I want to talk about what you think is going to happen now that we're
[2:19:19.760 --> 2:19:21.760]  going into this phase of hyperinflation.
[2:19:21.760 --> 2:19:24.760]  And then I want to keep you till 40 after.
[2:19:24.760 --> 2:19:26.760]  I want to do 10 minutes on solutions.
[2:19:26.760 --> 2:19:34.760]  And folks, you've got to get the film three-plus hours long available at infowars.com 1995.
[2:19:34.760 --> 2:19:36.760]  It is the money master's.
[2:19:36.760 --> 2:19:42.760]  It is you'll have a master's degree in this once you've seen it, or you can remain ignorant.
[2:19:42.760 --> 2:19:46.760]  We'll be right back with our amazing guest after this quick break.
[2:19:46.760 --> 2:19:49.760]  Hey, Bonnie, no more pickpocketing for us.
[2:19:49.760 --> 2:19:53.760]  I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without even knowing they've been robbed.
[2:19:53.760 --> 2:19:54.760]  How so, Clyde?
[2:19:54.760 --> 2:19:59.760]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet just by waving it near you.
[2:19:59.760 --> 2:20:02.760]  I can skim your credit card information while your card is still in your purse.
[2:20:02.760 --> 2:20:03.760]  Just watch.
[2:20:03.760 --> 2:20:05.760]  Hey, look, that's my info on the screen.
[2:20:05.760 --> 2:20:07.760]  You've got to be kidding me.
[2:20:07.760 --> 2:20:12.760]  Nope, with 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune.
[2:20:12.760 --> 2:20:14.760]  As long as people don't hear about identity stronghold.
[2:20:14.760 --> 2:20:15.760]  Why?
[2:20:15.760 --> 2:20:17.760]  What's identity stronghold?
[2:20:17.760 --> 2:20:18.760]  They make the secure sleeve.
[2:20:18.760 --> 2:20:22.760]  When people keep their credit cards in the shielded secure sleeve, I can't read them.
[2:20:22.760 --> 2:20:25.760]  Do a lot of people already know about the secure sleeve?
[2:20:25.760 --> 2:20:26.760]  No way.
[2:20:26.760 --> 2:20:29.760]  Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[2:20:29.760 --> 2:20:32.760]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[2:20:32.760 --> 2:20:33.760]  I already got some.
[2:20:33.760 --> 2:20:35.760]  I also got some to fit our passports.
[2:20:35.760 --> 2:20:40.760]  Identity stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at idstronghold.com.
[2:20:40.760 --> 2:20:42.760]  idstronghold.com?
[2:20:42.760 --> 2:20:43.760]  Right.
[2:20:43.760 --> 2:20:47.760]  Or you can call them at 1-800-610-2770.
[2:20:47.760 --> 2:20:53.760]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[2:20:53.760 --> 2:20:55.760]  And we knew what to do.
[2:20:55.760 --> 2:20:56.760]  Or at least we thought we did.
[2:20:56.760 --> 2:21:03.760]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[2:21:03.760 --> 2:21:12.760]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:21:12.760 --> 2:21:19.760]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[2:21:19.760 --> 2:21:22.760]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[2:21:22.760 --> 2:21:28.760]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[2:21:28.760 --> 2:21:31.760]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[2:21:31.760 --> 2:21:37.760]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.

[2:21:40.760 --> 2:21:46.760]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[2:21:46.760 --> 2:21:53.760]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[2:21:53.760 --> 2:21:58.760]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical,
[2:21:58.760 --> 2:22:01.760]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[2:22:01.760 --> 2:22:07.760]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt,
[2:22:07.760 --> 2:22:09.760]  ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[2:22:09.760 --> 2:22:14.760]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[2:22:14.760 --> 2:22:19.760]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[2:22:19.760 --> 2:22:23.760]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[2:22:23.760 --> 2:22:29.760]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[2:22:29.760 --> 2:22:34.760]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[2:22:34.760 --> 2:22:37.760]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[2:22:42.760 --> 2:22:46.760]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[2:22:46.760 --> 2:22:52.760]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints, lack of energy, and weight gain,
[2:22:52.760 --> 2:22:57.760]  I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet, but it just seems so difficult.
[2:22:57.760 --> 2:23:01.760]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter water ionizer from SnyderHealth.com
[2:23:01.760 --> 2:23:06.760]  and detox my body even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[2:23:06.760 --> 2:23:09.760]  Drinking water? Now that's something I can handle.
[2:23:09.760 --> 2:23:15.760]  The guys at SnyderHealth took the time to explain all of the different options and helped me choose the ionizer that was right for me.
[2:23:15.760 --> 2:23:19.760]  I use my new Jupiter ionizer for everything, for drinking, for cooking.
[2:23:19.760 --> 2:23:25.760]  And since I've been drinking the water, I have more energy, my joint pains are gone, and I already lost 7 pounds,
[2:23:25.760 --> 2:23:27.760]  and my skin looks great.
[2:23:27.760 --> 2:23:34.760]  Give them a call today at 877-356-2508 to find out which ionizer is right for you.
[2:23:34.760 --> 2:23:39.760]  They offer a full 30-day money-back guarantee and free shipping, so there's absolutely no risk.
[2:23:39.760 --> 2:24:05.760]  You can visit them on the web at SnyderHealth.com. That's SNYDRHealth.com.
[2:24:09.760 --> 2:24:17.760]  I'm a US farmer. I make a living off the land. I ride a John Deere tractor. I'm a liberated man,
[2:24:17.760 --> 2:24:27.760]  but the rain hasn't fallen since the middle of July. And if it don't come soon, my crops will die.
[2:24:27.760 --> 2:24:37.760]  The bankman says he likes me, but there's nothing he can do. He tells me that he's coming, but the clouds are coming too.
[2:24:37.760 --> 2:24:43.760]  He ain't my friend, and I'll ride again.
[2:24:43.760 --> 2:24:51.760]  Well, we've got a former banker who is our friend on the line with us, Pat Carmack, the producer, the maker of the Money Masters
[2:24:51.760 --> 2:24:55.760]  and the fellow all over the world, and did a splendid job.
[2:24:55.760 --> 2:25:01.760]  Former newspaper editor and reporter of presenting the information all over the world.
[2:25:01.760 --> 2:25:06.760]  Bill Still, this is a short segment, the final segment with you guys coming up with solutions.
[2:25:06.760 --> 2:25:13.760]  But right now, gentlemen, I mean, Ron Paul, Joseph Sticklets, the head of Newark Business School,
[2:25:13.760 --> 2:25:19.760]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, I mean, I've interviewed them all. They say if things aren't reversed, and they're not going to be, it looks like,
[2:25:19.760 --> 2:25:27.760]  within two and a half years, a hyperinflationary depression that makes 1929 US look tame
[2:25:27.760 --> 2:25:33.760]  and more of a German Weimar Republic type blood in the streets.
[2:25:33.760 --> 2:25:44.760]  Well, that's correct, and unfortunately, since you are convinced by the US notes solution that we offer,
[2:25:44.760 --> 2:25:51.760]  you're going to be one of the few. There's going to be an increasing drumbeat for a gold-backed solution.
[2:25:51.760 --> 2:26:00.760]  That is the alternative solution. That's why the bankers unloaded Fort Knox back in the late 1960s, early 70s.
[2:26:00.760 --> 2:26:06.760]  That's my belief. They always know that Ponzi schemes come to an end. They've got to start a new one.
[2:26:06.760 --> 2:26:14.760]  And they will be the ones ultimately behind and funding this return to a gold-backed currency.
[2:26:14.760 --> 2:26:22.760]  That's what I believe is behind the Ludwig von Meisters Institute, and you're going to be swimming against the tide.
[2:26:22.760 --> 2:26:29.760]  I want to be clear. I think those pushing for gold mean well because it would be better than the current system at its end,
[2:26:29.760 --> 2:26:35.760]  but you're right. It puts us just back into another monopoly of currency situation.
[2:26:35.760 --> 2:26:43.760]  As long as fractional reserve banking itself, the ability of these private banks to create money isn't the primary focus.
[2:26:43.760 --> 2:26:53.760]  If it's redirected to the nature of money, whether it be gold or silver, any other form of basket of commodities has been proposed,
[2:26:53.760 --> 2:27:01.760]  like portion of wheat and rice and so on. Anything like that is a red herring. It doesn't matter if in fact the private banks are still creating the money,
[2:27:01.760 --> 2:27:06.760]  because they're still going to be concentrating wealth more and more into their own hands.
[2:27:06.760 --> 2:27:11.760]  That's it. It's real simple. It's a rigged game. Who always wins a game of monopoly? The bank.
[2:27:11.760 --> 2:27:20.760]  The bank always wins. They have an 18-wheeler full of funny money, folks, and you're fighting your life out for a few little scraps of pink and purple and green paper.
[2:27:20.760 --> 2:27:32.760]  Well, we kind of hopped over William Jennings Bryant. Bryant gave what was widely considered to be the most important speech at the Democratic National Convention
[2:27:32.760 --> 2:27:37.760]  when he was running for president. In the conclusion, he put it this way,
[2:27:37.760 --> 2:27:51.760]  we will answer their demand for a gold standard. In other words, a return to a gold-backed money by saying to them, you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.
[2:27:51.760 --> 2:27:54.760]  Bryant understood the situation.
[2:27:54.760 --> 2:28:03.760]  By the way, I'm flattered by the New York Times calling me the William Jennings Bryant 911 Truth Movement, just not tooting my horn. It's just crazy to be compared to him. Go ahead.
[2:28:03.760 --> 2:28:15.760]  Well, you should be flattered because that's high praise. You know, Bryant is one of the people who has been expunged from history just like much of Andrew Jackson's heroic acts to save the country from the bankers
[2:28:15.760 --> 2:28:27.760]  because typically they either own or have a major interest or advertise in a way with publishing houses so that this whole important part of history is just gone.
[2:28:27.760 --> 2:28:37.760]  So here's an interesting little quote from Sir Josiah Stamp, the director of the Bank of England in 1928. He was the second wealthiest man in England at the time.
[2:28:37.760 --> 2:28:44.760]  He said, if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery, let them continue to create money.
[2:28:44.760 --> 2:28:49.760]  And we've got in the videos, you know, there's many quotes like that. There's a lot of us.
[2:28:49.760 --> 2:28:54.760]  It's unbelievable. And who's the fellow that does that voiceover?
[2:28:54.760 --> 2:29:01.760]  He was a radio talk show host who is now deceased. I forget his name, but he just had a great voice, didn't he?
[2:29:01.760 --> 2:29:09.760]  Well, I'm just telling you, Bill, that because I've made a few films myself, you're a great presenter and a great voiceover, too.
[2:29:09.760 --> 2:29:15.760]  I'm just a big fan of you. Final segment, gentlemen, you bet. Final segment, gentlemen, I want to come back.
[2:29:15.760 --> 2:29:24.760]  And I mean, as a one-off film, you guys went to master level out of the gates. You guys are naturals. I wish you'd make more films.
[2:29:24.760 --> 2:29:27.760]  When we come back, I want to do a final segment with you on Solutions.
[2:29:27.760 --> 2:29:32.760]  Then Steve Watson joins us from London, England. He got picked up by the secret police, all part of the new freedom.
[2:29:32.760 --> 2:29:37.760]  Stay with us. Final segment with our guests.
[2:29:37.760 --> 2:29:46.760]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[2:30:52.760 --> 2:30:57.760]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:30:57.760 --> 2:31:02.760]  It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[2:31:02.760 --> 2:31:13.760]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:31:13.760 --> 2:31:20.760]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:31:20.760 --> 2:31:24.760]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[2:31:24.760 --> 2:31:27.760]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:31:27.760 --> 2:31:31.760]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.
[2:31:31.760 --> 2:31:32.760]  Yes, they're after music.

[2:31:55.760 --> 2:31:58.760]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[2:31:58.760 --> 2:32:02.760]  Finalized the contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston.
[2:32:02.760 --> 2:32:08.760]  Online from my desk with WebEx. WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.

[2:32:52.760 --> 2:32:59.760]  With their fabulous wealth, the European private banking families married into the royalty.
[2:32:59.760 --> 2:33:10.760]  This predatory hybrid of control freak merciless psychopaths engineered and funded the modern eugenics movement.
[2:33:10.760 --> 2:33:14.760]  The movement of propaganda and advertising.
[2:33:14.760 --> 2:33:22.760]  They have dumbed the population down. They're carrying out chemical weapon and biological weapons soft kill operations against the whole planet.
[2:33:22.760 --> 2:33:32.760]  They decided they want to play God and reduce the world's population forcibly by 80 to 90% in all of their public treatises.
[2:33:32.760 --> 2:33:37.760]  They are setting up a worldwide police state grid to reduce us to 500 million.
[2:33:37.760 --> 2:33:39.760]  That's the other side of the story.
[2:33:39.760 --> 2:33:45.760]  They've got a bankrupt. You see your peon slave so they can carry out their eugenics on you.
[2:33:45.760 --> 2:33:55.760]  You see if you're middle class you'll be educated and informed and have a chance to combine forces as a middle class to overthrow the hegemonic corrupt elite.
[2:33:55.760 --> 2:33:59.760]  The enemy has studied history. That's why they call it the final revolution.
[2:33:59.760 --> 2:34:09.760]  They intend on damning up resistance forever and ensuring the monopoly of power forever as the elite and their progeny travel to the stars.
[2:34:09.760 --> 2:34:14.760]  It is the ultimate greediness and self-centeredness and the words I'm telling you are their own.
[2:34:14.760 --> 2:34:20.760]  They intend to blot us out of history to strike our names off all the monuments.
[2:34:20.760 --> 2:34:24.760]  We will not even be remembered in history if the elite has their way.
[2:34:24.760 --> 2:34:32.760]  Their evil has metastasized into a nightmare vision from hell itself.
[2:34:32.760 --> 2:34:35.760]  Steve Watson waiting in the wings 10 minutes away.
[2:34:35.760 --> 2:34:44.760]  Heads up infowars.net and is the weekend editor of prisonplanet.com, himself picked up by the secret police in England that are now everywhere.
[2:34:44.760 --> 2:34:47.760]  We've got a bunch of mainstream news about that.
[2:34:47.760 --> 2:34:53.760]  They also stand by while children drown. That's mainstream news saying it's not their job to save drowning children in the fames.
[2:34:53.760 --> 2:34:58.760]  This is the dehumanization and the robotic brain system that they've been given.
[2:34:58.760 --> 2:35:07.760]  In closing with our amazing guests, Pat Carmack and Bill Still of the Money Masters Film, solutions, gentlemen, solutions.
[2:35:07.760 --> 2:35:15.760]  How do we put your monetary reform act that I do believe, and I've read scores of books from all different sides and studied it and interviewed most of the world's experts.
[2:35:15.760 --> 2:35:26.760]  I believe your plan is preeminent, but first there should be a public debate about why we're going into this hardship and then a debate so that people can choose the system they want.
[2:35:26.760 --> 2:35:32.760]  But unfortunately, as you were saying, we're going to be thrown from one fire into another pit.
[2:35:32.760 --> 2:35:34.760]  Go ahead, gentlemen.
[2:35:34.760 --> 2:35:44.760]  Well, I'd like to take credit for the act and I'm sure Bill would too, but really it's antecedents include Milton Friedman and many other monetary reformers.
[2:35:44.760 --> 2:35:47.760]  But the essence of it is very simple.
[2:35:47.760 --> 2:35:55.760]  It's that the United States government pays off its national debt with United States notes.
[2:35:55.760 --> 2:35:57.760]  They're debt-free.
[2:35:57.760 --> 2:36:00.760]  And that are debt-free that it creates out of nothing.
[2:36:00.760 --> 2:36:08.760]  Now, the objection to that is always raised, well, that would be hyperinflationary because there's $9.5 trillion in national debt, and that would be true.
[2:36:08.760 --> 2:36:23.760]  And so to take care of that part of it, and this was Friedman's brilliant contribution, is at the same time he simultaneously increased the reserve requirements for banks from 10%, which it is now, which is what allows them to create 90% of the U.S. money supply.
[2:36:23.760 --> 2:36:37.760]  Yes, your inflationary plan curve is microscopic compared to the black hole vortex that Frasional Reserve Banking creates where it's mathematically a certainty designed to implode all wealth unto itself.
[2:36:37.760 --> 2:36:50.760]  Well, right, but actually, if you increase the reserve requirement to 100% during the same time period where you're paying off the national debt, which we propose as a year, then there is no inflation, exactly equal each other.
[2:36:50.760 --> 2:36:58.760]  So it's a brilliant solution that is principally earlier reformers and Milton Friedman's that the video goes into.
[2:36:58.760 --> 2:37:01.760]  And it's also detailed on our website.
[2:37:01.760 --> 2:37:07.760]  It's on the page that says monetary reform act under the moneymasters.com website.
[2:37:07.760 --> 2:37:10.760]  That's right, moneymasters.com to get the monetary reform act.
[2:37:10.760 --> 2:37:25.760]  Yeah, so the word be in front of it. And you can read the whole thing. It's 18 sections, and we go into considerable detail in it, but that would abolish the ability of banks, private banks, to create money.
[2:37:25.760 --> 2:37:32.760]  This is the stake. Do we have the energy to approach the vampires and to drive it through their hearts?
[2:37:32.760 --> 2:37:40.760]  Well, that's a question of political will, but the last time that there was a reasonable prospect of reform was in the Great Depression.
[2:37:40.760 --> 2:37:46.760]  And of course, as many economic commentators have noted, we're in the closest thing to it since that time period.
[2:37:46.760 --> 2:38:00.760]  At that time, he had a lot of brilliant reform proposals, and they were promoted by people who were widely listened to by the American people, including Bob LaFollette, Huey Long, Father Coglin.
[2:38:00.760 --> 2:38:10.760]  He's had tens of millions of listeners and followers, and people were becoming educated about how the economic system works.
[2:38:10.760 --> 2:38:20.760]  And many partial reform proposals were passed at that time, but the Federal Reserve was not abolished. The war intervened.
[2:38:20.760 --> 2:38:32.760]  So we're in a similar situation where the economy is becoming so bad that people are paying attention, they're reading, they're listening, and of course, shows like this help educate the public.
[2:38:32.760 --> 2:38:43.760]  And I'd just like to say that the argument that you'll hear against this is that bankers should be responsible for creating money. They're the only ones that know how to do it.
[2:38:43.760 --> 2:38:53.760]  And they said that in 1913 and promised no more panics that were microscopic compared to the Great Depression, and they engineered the Great Depression just a few years later.
[2:38:53.760 --> 2:39:03.760]  And what this is, is a plutocracy. That concept is the very basis of plutocracy, which is ruled by the rich. That's what we have today. We do not have a democracy.
[2:39:03.760 --> 2:39:19.760]  We have a plutocracy. If you believe in democracy, you must believe that the closest federally elected body, the people in the Congress, should control money, and no less an authority than Abraham Lincoln.
[2:39:19.760 --> 2:39:33.760]  And one other objection is, well, we're just turning it back over to Congress, which we've said the bankers control. Well, that's true, but the bankers control it through the creation of wealth. If you take away that vehicle from them, then you begin to rebuild the independence of Congress.
[2:39:33.760 --> 2:39:48.760]  You put the power of fiat currency in the hands of the people, and you educate them about its nature, and it's very transparent, and you debate it and discuss it, and then it energizes back to 10-12% growth rates, and back to where one person can work, and the family can have milk and honey.
[2:39:48.760 --> 2:39:56.760]  With our manufacturing systems today, we could all live like kings, but the elite aren't going to allow that. And so this is your entire future, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:39:56.760 --> 2:40:10.760]  You better go to themoneymasters.com, read the monetary reform section. If you don't, shame on you, and you better go to infowars.com and get the DVD for 1995 while you're at it. Get my new film, Truth Rising, and have groups to your house.
[2:40:10.760 --> 2:40:25.760]  Show this to people. Show this to your local economics professor or your business teacher in public school. People are very receptive to this right now, and I hear them like blind sheep saying, oh, why is everything so expensive?
[2:40:25.760 --> 2:40:46.760]  I mean, they're so economically ignorant that I talk to business people, and they don't understand currency devaluation and how it's being done by design, and how the private banking families have put all their assets into real commodities and property, and then now they're leaving us at the tail end of the Ponzi scheme holding the bag, and then now they're going to pose as saviors again.
[2:40:46.760 --> 2:41:03.760]  The Federal Reserve has said, oh, give us global power for a global bank, buy carbon credits from us. That'll be their new Ponzi bubble, along with the gold, as you were saying, and they've said, come to us, and we will regulate all banks globally.
[2:41:03.760 --> 2:41:17.760]  We will make you buy carbon credits, so they screw it all up, poses the saviors. Not only do we have no hope of averting the disaster, but we have no hope of ever getting out of it if they're able to go to the next level.
[2:41:17.760 --> 2:41:30.760]  They've got their grid in place to make the Great Depression look like a tea party, and 8 million people, according to a major university study that came out last month, the Associated Press, starved to death during the Great Depression during the nine years.
[2:41:30.760 --> 2:41:45.760]  We now are 90% urban, not 90% agrarian and rural, so it'll be much worse now. We're talking about, gentlemen, do you see any way of averting the depression in their engineering?
[2:41:45.760 --> 2:41:52.760]  No, there's absolutely no way outside of the Monetary Form Act, and everything else will come to naught.
[2:41:52.760 --> 2:42:04.760]  Well, historically, I mean, there is, you know, one way that has been used is war, and because it, you know, it changes the whole, you know, it results in all kinds of economic controls and so forth.
[2:42:04.760 --> 2:42:17.760]  And that's a psychological diversion, so we accept the depression. The war is only meant as a salve, as a foil, as a shield for the bankers to go ahead and implode things, but then have us rally around them while they suck our blood.
[2:42:17.760 --> 2:42:25.760]  That's right, and it also continues the process of concentrating more and more wealth in their hands, even more rapidly.
[2:42:25.760 --> 2:42:34.760]  Well, gentlemen, I want to close the interview with Professor Carol Quigley, renowned late Georgetown historian, President Clinton's mentor.
[2:42:34.760 --> 2:42:46.760]  The powers of financial capitalism had a far-reaching plan, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political systems of each country and the economy of the world as a whole.
[2:42:46.760 --> 2:42:53.760]  Their secret is that they have annexed from governments, monarchies, and republics the power to create the world's money.
[2:42:53.760 --> 2:42:58.760]  And gentlemen, you have created a rosetta stone to expose and defeat the enemy.
[2:42:58.760 --> 2:43:06.760]  I salute you both, and I want to have you back up both of you for two hours in the near future to focus more on reform and the history and to take calls.
[2:43:06.760 --> 2:43:08.760]  I salute you. Thank you for joining us.
[2:43:08.760 --> 2:43:09.760]  Thank you for having us.
[2:43:09.760 --> 2:43:19.760]  Take care. There they go, the producers of the Money Masters. Get it at infowars.com today or call toll 3-888-253-3139.
[2:43:19.760 --> 2:43:24.760]  It's in the shopping cart, and there's a link on the front page of infowars.com.
[2:43:24.760 --> 2:43:36.760]  Now, joining us from London, England for the balance of this hour before Ralph Winterwood joins us in the final hour is Steve Watson.
[2:43:36.760 --> 2:43:48.760]  He is the head of infowars.net, and of course, he also is the weekend editor of prisonplanet.com, two of my most successful sites.
[2:43:48.760 --> 2:43:54.760]  A few years ago, I was in England, not just bullhorning parliament a day before they banned protests in that area.
[2:43:54.760 --> 2:44:01.760]  The birthplace of the Magna Carta was actually running me, but that's where it's enshrined there in 1215.
[2:44:01.760 --> 2:44:09.760]  Before that, I was just filming in the streets of London and talking to people about what do you think about what's happening?
[2:44:09.760 --> 2:44:11.760]  What do you think about these street cameras?
[2:44:11.760 --> 2:44:15.760]  And police would listen to what you had to say, and if they didn't like it, they'd walk over and say,
[2:44:15.760 --> 2:44:20.760]  give me your name, give me your ID, I'm putting you in a database, big, long form.
[2:44:20.760 --> 2:44:24.760]  And then they'd say, turn your camera off, don't tape me, and you're not allowed to tape in London.
[2:44:24.760 --> 2:44:31.760]  What's the law? And they just said, shut up, and start petting their billy clubs.
[2:44:31.760 --> 2:44:39.760]  They also have these minion Stasi police that are just citizens, but have the common law right to arrest that really any citizen has.
[2:44:39.760 --> 2:44:48.760]  And they questioned us and bossed us about, but now millions and millions of people have been put in the database, and they're everywhere.
[2:44:48.760 --> 2:44:54.760]  And they leave foreigners alone, they leave real thugs on, they've been told to.
[2:44:54.760 --> 2:44:57.760]  More and more thugs are imported to scare the British into submission.
[2:44:57.760 --> 2:45:03.760]  And this is secret police, just like in Cuba or in Russia or in Nazi Germany, and they just come over and say, where are you going?
[2:45:03.760 --> 2:45:05.760]  What are you doing? I want to see inside your pockets.
[2:45:05.760 --> 2:45:08.760]  They mainly, and it's in the news, they mainly target old people.
[2:45:08.760 --> 2:45:14.760]  Now, there's another mainstream media report of the parents are about to sue where this little girl fell into the water,
[2:45:14.760 --> 2:45:18.760]  a little child fell in the water, and then the brother jumped in, they were drowning and they did drown.
[2:45:18.760 --> 2:45:20.760]  And it was right there on the edge of the river.
[2:45:20.760 --> 2:45:23.760]  And the police said, we don't do that.
[2:45:23.760 --> 2:45:28.760]  We, we are not authorized to help people under orders, only a quote full officer can do it.
[2:45:28.760 --> 2:45:30.760]  So they waited and watched them die.
[2:45:30.760 --> 2:45:33.760]  And these people are robotic.
[2:45:33.760 --> 2:45:37.760]  And they have been, they're told, you advance the more robotic you are.
[2:45:37.760 --> 2:45:39.760]  So this happened to Steve Watson.
[2:45:39.760 --> 2:45:47.760]  And now you're arrested, if you say you don't like hot food, as you're putting a terror database as a child, that's mainstream news.
[2:45:47.760 --> 2:45:48.760]  You can't make this up.
[2:45:48.760 --> 2:45:51.760]  London Telegraph, I mean, it's all happening.
[2:45:51.760 --> 2:45:53.760]  It's all what you say, what you do.
[2:45:53.760 --> 2:45:56.760]  No society's ever been this controlled.
[2:45:56.760 --> 2:45:58.760]  Steve Watson, tell us what happened.
[2:45:58.760 --> 2:46:00.760]  Well, Alex, I did.
[2:46:00.760 --> 2:46:01.760]  Good, my friend.
[2:46:01.760 --> 2:46:08.760]  Well, yeah, basically what happened to me was I was coming back into London on Sunday.
[2:46:08.760 --> 2:46:12.760]  I've been to a festival to see Neil Young play, which was very good indeed.
[2:46:12.760 --> 2:46:19.760]  So I was in high spirits and basically walking with my girlfriend, deciding how we were going to get home.
[2:46:19.760 --> 2:46:24.760]  Came into Trafalgar Square, debating which bus to get home.
[2:46:24.760 --> 2:46:31.760]  Suddenly, I hear this voice order me, just says, you, stand over there.
[2:46:31.760 --> 2:46:46.760]  So at first I thought, you know, they must be talking to somebody behind me, turn around and there's two bright yellow, jacketed police community support officers standing there.
[2:46:46.760 --> 2:46:50.760]  And I just said, are you talking to me?
[2:46:50.760 --> 2:46:54.760]  And he said, just repeated it, robotically, just stand over there.
[2:46:54.760 --> 2:46:55.760]  That's right.
[2:46:55.760 --> 2:46:56.760]  And they also cover their badges.
[2:46:56.760 --> 2:47:01.760]  It's all about not knowing who they are either if they're starting that here in the United States.
[2:47:01.760 --> 2:47:03.760]  It's about letting you know you're the slave.
[2:47:03.760 --> 2:47:07.760]  That's why you take your shoes off at the airport to get athletes foot, why they yell at you.
[2:47:07.760 --> 2:47:10.760]  It's all about being trained how to be a slave.
[2:47:10.760 --> 2:47:11.760]  So yeah.
[2:47:11.760 --> 2:47:13.760]  And so I said, no, thanks.
[2:47:13.760 --> 2:47:15.760]  I think I'll just stay here.
[2:47:15.760 --> 2:47:22.760]  I was, you know, just stood near the bus stop and he just repeated it again, stand over there.
[2:47:22.760 --> 2:47:30.760]  And this went on for about five minutes until I said to him, I'm not going to move until you tell me why you want me to move.
[2:47:30.760 --> 2:47:33.760]  Which, you know, they can't, they have to give you a reason.
[2:47:33.760 --> 2:47:36.760]  They can't just stop anybody and say and order them around.
[2:47:36.760 --> 2:47:43.760]  So this went on for a while and then he started saying, we can either do this that easy way or the hard way.
[2:47:43.760 --> 2:47:53.760]  Now, I don't know what the hard way is, but basically he's just ordering me around speaking to me as if I'm some kind of animal.
[2:47:53.760 --> 2:47:54.760]  Well, that's the new thing here.
[2:47:54.760 --> 2:48:01.760]  If you ask police here, most of them, and I've been to Chicago, New York all over, they'll just say, you want to do this the easy way or the hard way.
[2:48:01.760 --> 2:48:03.760]  People that ask questions get hurt.
[2:48:03.760 --> 2:48:05.760]  Go ahead.
[2:48:05.760 --> 2:48:16.760]  So anyway, after five minutes, he eventually said, I'm stopping you because I saw you adjust your shirt and put your hand in your pocket.
[2:48:16.760 --> 2:48:21.760]  So naturally, I was a little bit baffled by this.
[2:48:21.760 --> 2:48:26.760]  Now, Steve, I sat on park benches and rode around in buses and watched them all over harassing people.
[2:48:26.760 --> 2:48:27.760]  They now do it in DC.
[2:48:27.760 --> 2:48:29.760]  I just witnessed it there a month ago.
[2:48:29.760 --> 2:48:31.760]  You're a good looking guy.
[2:48:31.760 --> 2:48:32.760]  I've seen some of your other girlfriends.
[2:48:32.760 --> 2:48:33.760]  I don't know this girlfriend.
[2:48:33.760 --> 2:48:34.760]  Probably good looking.
[2:48:34.760 --> 2:48:37.760]  They hate good looking, happy looking people.
[2:48:37.760 --> 2:48:43.760]  It's just lowest common denominator scum trolls out harassing people.
[2:48:43.760 --> 2:48:44.760]  And I've seen it.
[2:48:44.760 --> 2:48:47.760]  They go after people they're jealous of.
[2:48:47.760 --> 2:48:49.760]  Go ahead.
[2:48:49.760 --> 2:48:52.760]  So he started saying to me, have you got what's in your pocket?
[2:48:52.760 --> 2:48:55.760]  Have you got anything in your pocket that you shouldn't have?
[2:48:55.760 --> 2:48:57.760]  So I just said, like what?
[2:48:57.760 --> 2:49:00.760]  And he just went, you tell me.
[2:49:00.760 --> 2:49:04.760]  And so I'm just saying, well, no, you tell me it's your job, you've stopped me.
[2:49:04.760 --> 2:49:07.760]  You tell me what you think I've got in my pocket.
[2:49:07.760 --> 2:49:15.760]  And this went on for another few minutes until he, until I just, I mean, this was at sort of 1245 a.m.
[2:49:15.760 --> 2:49:17.760]  It was quarter to one in the morning.
[2:49:17.760 --> 2:49:19.760]  So I just wanted to get home really.
[2:49:19.760 --> 2:49:21.760]  I mean, it's still, it was in Trafalgar Square.
[2:49:21.760 --> 2:49:23.760]  It's still a busy area at that time.
[2:49:23.760 --> 2:49:24.760]  But I was tired.
[2:49:24.760 --> 2:49:26.760]  I just wanted to go home.
[2:49:26.760 --> 2:49:32.760]  And so I just, you know, kind of sped up the situation.
[2:49:32.760 --> 2:49:34.760]  You submitted him.
[2:49:34.760 --> 2:49:38.760]  No, I didn't submit, but I sped up the situation because I know what they do.
[2:49:38.760 --> 2:49:40.760]  The police support community.
[2:49:40.760 --> 2:49:42.760]  No, I mean, my point is the general public's being trained.
[2:49:42.760 --> 2:49:46.760]  I mean, they train children to go on FEMA buses to camps, but then go ahead.
[2:49:46.760 --> 2:49:52.760]  Basically, if you don't give them ID or show them what's in your pocket, they just call the police.
[2:49:52.760 --> 2:49:55.760]  You have to wait half an hour for the police to come.
[2:49:55.760 --> 2:49:58.760]  And then if you don't cooperate with the police, they tell you to police station.
[2:49:58.760 --> 2:49:59.760]  So I just wanted to get home.
[2:49:59.760 --> 2:50:01.760]  So I said, look, I've got nothing in my pocket.
[2:50:01.760 --> 2:50:02.760]  Showed him what was in my pocket.
[2:50:02.760 --> 2:50:03.760]  Gave him ID.
[2:50:03.760 --> 2:50:09.760]  He put a call into the higher authorities to just to check that I wasn't a wanted felon.
[2:50:09.760 --> 2:50:17.760]  And all the while he's got this colleague who's, you know, stood a few steps away from me just saying,
[2:50:17.760 --> 2:50:19.760]  look, this is just procedure.
[2:50:19.760 --> 2:50:20.760]  You've done nothing wrong.
[2:50:20.760 --> 2:50:21.760]  You've got nothing to worry about.
[2:50:21.760 --> 2:50:23.760]  Just let him get on with it.
[2:50:23.760 --> 2:50:28.760]  And it's a procedure to go through airport scanners that scan your neck and body now in mobile trucks.
[2:50:28.760 --> 2:50:35.760]  It's just a procedure to take your blood on the side of the highway from Austin, Texas to Chicago, Illinois without true warrants.
[2:50:35.760 --> 2:50:40.760]  It's just a procedure to have them put mercury in your child's vaccine as they have convulsions.
[2:50:40.760 --> 2:50:42.760]  I want to talk behind scenes with you, Steve.
[2:50:42.760 --> 2:50:43.760]  Stay there.
[2:50:43.760 --> 2:50:47.760]  We're going to Steve right now.
[2:50:47.760 --> 2:50:49.760]  Life has changed.
[2:50:49.760 --> 2:50:51.760]  We're not 21 anymore.
[2:50:51.760 --> 2:50:54.760]  We have responsibilities.
[2:50:54.760 --> 2:50:57.760]  That's why there's Drink and Made Hangover Defense.
[2:50:57.760 --> 2:50:59.760]  Sure, we've done our share of partying.
[2:50:59.760 --> 2:51:00.760]  Yeah, dude.
[2:51:00.760 --> 2:51:04.760]  Now kicking back with the neighbors and a few beers is more our style.
[2:51:04.760 --> 2:51:10.760]  But let's face it, as we get older, even that can leave us feeling run down the next morning.
[2:51:10.760 --> 2:51:15.760]  With Drink and Made, you can have a few drinks tonight without waking up feeling like you had a few.
[2:51:15.760 --> 2:51:21.760]  Drink and Made's patented and proven formula of guava leaf extract has antioxidants and other unique properties
[2:51:21.760 --> 2:51:27.760]  that help prevent the headache, queasy stomach, and dehydration even a few drinks can leave behind.
[2:51:27.760 --> 2:51:31.760]  Just dissolve one Drink and Made in water and take it before bed.
[2:51:31.760 --> 2:51:32.760]  It's that easy.
[2:51:32.760 --> 2:51:36.760]  The next morning, bring on the responsibilities.
[2:51:36.760 --> 2:51:40.760]  Drink and Made Hangover Defense is available at retailers nationwide.
[2:51:40.760 --> 2:51:41.760]  Pick up some today.
[2:51:41.760 --> 2:51:45.760]  Remember your Drink and Made, and wake up feeling great.
[2:51:45.760 --> 2:51:48.760]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[2:51:48.760 --> 2:51:50.760]  I've come with a message of information.
[2:51:50.760 --> 2:51:53.760]  9-Eleven was an inside job.
[2:51:53.760 --> 2:51:54.760]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[2:51:54.760 --> 2:51:56.760]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[2:51:56.760 --> 2:51:59.760]  How do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a state?
[2:51:59.760 --> 2:52:03.760]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR.
[2:52:03.760 --> 2:52:05.760]  We sit down and shout.
[2:52:05.760 --> 2:52:12.760]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[2:52:12.760 --> 2:52:18.760]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[2:52:18.760 --> 2:52:20.760]  An inside job?
[2:52:20.760 --> 2:52:22.760]  How dare you?
[2:52:22.760 --> 2:52:28.760]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:52:28.760 --> 2:52:31.760]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:52:31.760 --> 2:52:37.760]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-Eleven.

[2:53:46.760 --> 2:54:12.760]  Okay, Steve Watson, dear in the behind the scenes of prisonplanet.tv viewers and the info war stream listeners, we were talking about how they're putting three-year-olds in criminal databases if they say yuck when the government school feeds them curry.
[2:54:12.760 --> 2:54:19.760]  Yuck is now not allowed. Police are called. I mean, we're not kidding, folks. This is maximum enforcement on the general public.
[2:54:19.760 --> 2:54:33.760]  Just absolute control. And so finish up. He's there with the big form filling it out on you. You're going in the national database because you put your hand in your pocket at a bus stop. Go ahead.
[2:54:33.760 --> 2:54:43.760]  Well, he wasn't filling in the form until he asked me, do you want to wait 15 minutes while I fill in this form?
[2:54:43.760 --> 2:54:51.760]  And I just said, no, I don't want to wait 15 minutes. Just fill it in and put me in the database with the rest of the innocent people.
[2:54:51.760 --> 2:54:55.760]  Yeah, he was offering you a copy. He was going to fill the form and I had two forms.
[2:54:55.760 --> 2:55:04.760]  They have to buy law. I mean, let's be clear. Now, just like the federal marshal said last year in the Denver Post, they said, look, we're ordered with quotas to put people in it.
[2:55:04.760 --> 2:55:13.760]  Children, a mother takes a photo out of plain window for the rest of their lives are listed as terrorists. This is false. We've been ordered to put innocent people in.
[2:55:13.760 --> 2:55:24.760]  Now there's over 2 million Britons in this in just a year. That means they over 25 years, each individual, that's how much time has been spent filling this out if one person did all the filling out, Paul.
[2:55:24.760 --> 2:55:26.760]  I mean, Steve.
[2:55:26.760 --> 2:55:34.760]  Yeah, there was an article in the, it was the telegraph yesterday because there were a load of figures released yesterday by the government stop and search figures.
[2:55:34.760 --> 2:55:39.760]  And this is the other thing. We've separated it into stop and search and stop and account.
[2:55:39.760 --> 2:55:46.760]  Now, that's not all. They also even mainstream reporters are grabbing cameras of all types in rural areas and cities.
[2:55:46.760 --> 2:55:57.760]  They'll come up to news vans and grab cameras and then there's, they give them a forum saying camera confiscated and you don't get it back. I mean, it's, it's just incredible.
[2:55:57.760 --> 2:56:09.760]  Yeah, and the figures released yesterday showed that there's been a rise of one third in the amount of people stops. It's now close to two. Well, it was 0607.
[2:56:09.760 --> 2:56:16.760]  Two million people were stopped, which was a rise from 1.4 million the previous year.
[2:56:16.760 --> 2:56:21.760]  Now, in New York last year, I saw the numbers and they went up from like 200,000 to 500 plus thousand random searches.
[2:56:21.760 --> 2:56:26.760]  And you'll be in New York. They'll block off the street. Everybody get up the wall. This is in end game, by the way.
[2:56:26.760 --> 2:56:34.760]  And not an end game in, in, uh, Truth Rising, my newest film. And they just cordon off the street, search every person, search every car. No warrants.
[2:56:34.760 --> 2:56:36.760]  Go ahead, Steve.
[2:56:36.760 --> 2:56:47.760]  Yeah. And, um, what I was saying, the most, most common reason for the searches that was given is they, you know, the police suspect they've got drugs or stolen property.
[2:56:47.760 --> 2:56:55.760]  And they're searching them under terrorism laws. So it's a clear, clear merging of crime prevention with terrorism.
[2:56:55.760 --> 2:57:00.760]  Until proven innocent. Well, when they have all these come to the local Tattletail FBI meeting, you get there to fight terror.
[2:57:00.760 --> 2:57:07.760]  We got video of it and they say, all right, is your neighbor smoking pot? Uh, they dumping garbage. Uh, they spanking their kids.
[2:57:07.760 --> 2:57:15.760]  Report this to us. You're now deputy, you know, minions. And because there is no real terror that they're not staging.
[2:57:15.760 --> 2:57:22.760]  Yeah. And the government here continues to, you know, push for even stronger stop and search laws under terrorism.
[2:57:22.760 --> 2:57:35.760]  I mean, at the moment, police can, they can carry out random searches. They designate an area, a chief officer does, and they can just go in there and.
[2:57:35.760 --> 2:57:38.760]  We just lost our connection to London.
[2:57:38.760 --> 2:57:41.760]  Oh, okay. Good. You're, you're back with Steve. Can you hear me?
[2:57:41.760 --> 2:57:42.760]  Yep.
[2:57:42.760 --> 2:57:49.760]  Probably my SDN. It's, it's been hellish. Stay there. We're going to come back on to one more segment, but, but this article is up on info wars.net.
[2:57:49.760 --> 2:57:56.760]  It's a very eloquent, lots of links to what they're doing. I mean, Steve, this is already Orwellian, uh, to the max.
[2:57:56.760 --> 2:58:03.760]  This is already the prisoner on steroids and it's only getting worse.
[2:58:03.760 --> 2:58:04.760]  Yeah.
[2:58:04.760 --> 2:58:12.760]  So we'll come back with a final segment with Steve Watson and Ralph Winterwood from Alaska is going to be joining us to talk about these private federal agencies.
[2:58:12.760 --> 2:58:14.760]  Letter of Mark is what they have.
[2:58:14.760 --> 2:58:20.760]  Is that the Queen of England would say to private shipping groups, go out and rob whoever you want. Here's a letter of Mark.
[2:58:20.760 --> 2:58:23.760]  Well, that's what most government agencies are now.
[2:58:23.760 --> 2:58:26.760]  We'll be talking about that. Steve Watson, stay with us.

[2:59:45.760 --> 3:00:02.760]  Folks, there are hundreds of articles in every major British and U.S. paper hyping war with Iran, saying they've got EMP weapons to destroy all our electronics in the U.S.
[3:00:02.760 --> 3:00:09.760]  Nukes, deadly poison monkeys, they're claiming their little missiles to go a couple hundred miles are deadly.
[3:00:09.760 --> 3:00:11.760]  I mean, they're hyping everything.
[3:00:11.760 --> 3:00:20.760]  It is just clearly the push for war is on. And throughout the week, we're going to be covering all of this in great detail with other key guests.
[3:00:20.760 --> 3:00:24.760]  That's even tourist schedule for Monday or Tuesday.
[3:00:24.760 --> 3:00:26.760]  So we'll see what happens then.
[3:00:26.760 --> 3:00:34.760]  Got another big guest coming up later this week, Steve Watson in closing in the four minutes we've got before Ralph Winterwood joins us.
[3:00:34.760 --> 3:00:45.760]  Any other key areas or points you want to make about what happened to you yesterday and how it ended after he he puts you into the terrorist database for life?
[3:00:45.760 --> 3:00:55.760]  Yeah, well, I'm in there now with everyone else, but out of the two million, you know, the figures released yesterday out of the two million people that were stopped.
[3:00:55.760 --> 3:01:05.760]  It's interesting to note that in the same year, only two hundred and twenty one were actually charged with terrorism offenses. And after that fact, 40 were convicted.
[3:01:05.760 --> 3:01:16.760]  And we know from looking at the articles and reading about those 40 that they were basically all complete, completely mentally retarded, basically.
[3:01:16.760 --> 3:01:22.760]  So they have terrorism suspects right there, but they stopped two million. They convicted 40.
[3:01:22.760 --> 3:01:30.760]  Yeah, they have their favorite thing is to arrest registered schizophrenics so they can beat up and drug up who they put on the news saying they did it.
[3:01:30.760 --> 3:01:37.760]  It's admitted schizophrenics or they will get people with 70 IQs or folks with brain injuries. And that's every one of them.
[3:01:37.760 --> 3:01:46.760]  Now, in your article, you list all the 84, 85, 80 year old innocent people walking down the street, they're being grabbed. Tell us about that.
[3:01:46.760 --> 3:01:57.760]  Yeah, I mean, there's an 82 year old, before in the break, there's an 82 year old Labour MP called Walter Wolfgang.
[3:01:57.760 --> 3:02:07.760]  In 2005, he was ejected from the party conference for shouting nonsense when Jack Straw was defending the party's Iraq policy.
[3:02:07.760 --> 3:02:10.760]  He was detained under terrorism laws.
[3:02:10.760 --> 3:02:19.760]  There was an 11 year old girl who was walking past the protest with a father who was searched by police under terrorism laws.
[3:02:19.760 --> 3:02:30.760]  There was a woman who was held for four hours by police for walking or trespassing as they called it on a cycle path in Scotland.
[3:02:30.760 --> 3:02:39.760]  There was a woman arrested for a Times of London headline, I believe it was two years ago,
[3:02:39.760 --> 3:02:47.760]  that said something bad about Blair and the cops said, you're not allowed to have a newspaper that says that and they arrested her.
[3:02:47.760 --> 3:02:55.760]  I think she was reading out names of soldiers who had been killed in Iraq. She was just reading them out.
[3:02:55.760 --> 3:03:03.760]  That was deemed protest and she was detained under terrorism laws for reading a paper.
[3:03:03.760 --> 3:03:10.760]  Now again, folks, this is England, this is the United States, this is clear tyranny, they're making their move.
[3:03:10.760 --> 3:03:12.760]  Steve, what do we do about this?
[3:03:12.760 --> 3:03:20.760]  Well, I mean, we just got to, I mean, I've been getting emails telling me I should have just told them to, you know, to F off or whatever.
[3:03:20.760 --> 3:03:24.760]  But if you do that, you get detained under public authority.
[3:03:24.760 --> 3:03:28.760]  No, no, these cockroaches would murder you on video camera and say you did it.
[3:03:28.760 --> 3:03:33.760]  That's exactly what they want. That's the attitude that they want, what they want you to do.
[3:03:33.760 --> 3:03:44.760]  So I think we just got it. We've got to just keep exposing it, rise above it, approach it with, you know, dignity and sound mind and not come down to the level that they want.
[3:03:44.760 --> 3:03:51.760]  Well, the good news is that Brits are finally getting mad and once you get them mad, it's hard to get, once you get them mad, things seem to change.
[3:03:51.760 --> 3:03:57.760]  I mean, that's what I'm seeing in the news and talking to people. They are starting to figure out that they're in a lot of trouble, aren't they?
[3:03:57.760 --> 3:04:12.760]  Yeah, I mean, I got off lucky as well because we've got an article up today about a young man who was basically hauled off a train, hauled to the ground and had six or seven submachine guns pointed at his head.
[3:04:12.760 --> 3:04:17.760]  He turned out he'd done nothing. He was just the wrong guy.
[3:04:17.760 --> 3:04:26.760]  Well, so you're shocked by that in England. I mean, try being tastered to death every day for nothing. Soon they'll be murdering you everywhere, giggling, laughing, running around, drinking their fluoride,
[3:04:26.760 --> 3:04:32.760]  begging to be chemical attacked by their gods. Steve Watson, great job. Thank you for spending time with us.
[3:04:32.760 --> 3:04:33.760]  Thanks a lot.
[3:04:33.760 --> 3:04:44.760]  There he goes. Read his great report at infowars.net. Some people are saying this is fear-mongering. It's just the facts. They are going and grabbing three-year-olds for saying they don't like food.

[3:05:44.760 --> 3:05:50.760]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[3:05:50.760 --> 3:05:55.760]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.

[3:06:19.760 --> 3:06:25.760]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[3:06:25.760 --> 3:06:30.760]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[3:06:44.760 --> 3:06:53.760]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[3:06:53.760 --> 3:07:00.760]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[3:07:00.760 --> 3:07:09.760]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:07:09.760 --> 3:07:16.760]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[3:07:16.760 --> 3:07:19.760]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[3:07:19.760 --> 3:07:25.760]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:07:25.760 --> 3:07:28.760]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[3:07:28.760 --> 3:07:37.760]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:07:37.760 --> 3:07:43.760]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[3:07:48.760 --> 3:07:56.760]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[3:07:56.760 --> 3:08:06.760]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:08:06.760 --> 3:08:11.760]  Well, he has been fighting the new order for a long, long time. He's a radio talk show host.
[3:08:11.760 --> 3:08:14.760]  He also has a website and done a lot of research.
[3:08:14.760 --> 3:08:20.760]  And I've interviewed a lot of law experts, a lot of people that have been successful, actually found out what's real and what isn't.
[3:08:20.760 --> 3:08:26.760]  And I've been checking out Ralph Winterich stuff for several years and it's good info.
[3:08:26.760 --> 3:08:32.760]  It's what I separately have discovered. You have these thousands of agencies, state, local, federal, international.
[3:08:32.760 --> 3:08:38.760]  The private letter of mark and the criminal government gives them a letter of mark to operate outside reality.
[3:08:38.760 --> 3:08:42.760]  That's why in the past, even military officers had to be commissioned by Congress.
[3:08:42.760 --> 3:08:48.760]  Well, now you have the complete, you know, different operation with private mercenaries like Blackwater Worldwide,
[3:08:48.760 --> 3:08:52.760]  who's now outside the U.S. coming in and going up against U.S. citizens.
[3:08:52.760 --> 3:09:00.760]  So I wanted to talk about his research into that and then just some of the horror stories he's witnessed over the years and things that are happening.
[3:09:00.760 --> 3:09:05.760]  You know, you hear about England, where of a toddler in a government preschool, they feed them hot sauce there.
[3:09:05.760 --> 3:09:13.760]  And if they don't like the hot sauce, that's there. Then police come and they're put for life into a racism database and lose all basically their liberties.
[3:09:13.760 --> 3:09:20.760]  You think that's crazy. Well, it's meant to be crazy. It's meant to get everybody in the system to get them in now.
[3:09:20.760 --> 3:09:26.760]  And it's the same thing here in the U.S. I mean, the government is predatory. It is coming for you. Period.
[3:09:26.760 --> 3:09:35.760]  Remember, this is a government that thousands of times marches U.S. British groups into gas chambers, murders them in Sarin VX nerve gas test,
[3:09:35.760 --> 3:09:44.760]  and then tells their families they died of the flu. This is a government that puts mercury in our vaccines, fluoride in our water, sodium fluoride knowing it hurts us.
[3:09:44.760 --> 3:09:52.760]  We have their own documents on that. This is a eugenics super state whose number one job, we have their own documents, destroy the family,
[3:09:52.760 --> 3:09:59.760]  break down the sovereignty to base the dollar. It's all happening. And Ralph Winner-Rude, I think it's best you describe yourself,
[3:09:59.760 --> 3:10:06.760]  what you think people should know for an audience that may not know who you are, about how you got started in this and what you've discovered.
[3:10:06.760 --> 3:10:14.760]  Well, I got started in this. I was in the telecommunications business and I had the largest privately held telephone connect company in Alaska.
[3:10:14.760 --> 3:10:25.760]  And when I went to bid this, I found out that they had added 7 million to a sealed bid and I took it to the Supreme Court and they said they couldn't see the problem.
[3:10:25.760 --> 3:10:30.760]  And I said, what in the world is going on? I mean, we got a couple of pieces of paper that a 10-year-old kid could figure out.
[3:10:30.760 --> 3:10:35.760]  They added 7 million to a sealed bid. So I got around and I started doing research.
[3:10:35.760 --> 3:10:38.760]  But then, hold on. Explain what that means for people.
[3:10:38.760 --> 3:10:44.760]  Well, what that means is I had a bid for 5 million dollars and these other people had bid 1.5 million.
[3:10:44.760 --> 3:10:55.760]  They forgot to add in another 7 million. The bid was open and all of a sudden, they allowed them to add 7 million to a sealed bid that had been open in public.
[3:10:55.760 --> 3:10:59.760]  And I took it to the Supreme Court because this is a real simple issue, right?
[3:10:59.760 --> 3:11:06.760]  I said, you know, the lawyer said this is good. I said, what's good? It's simple. Go to the Supreme Court of Alaska and they said, we don't see a problem.
[3:11:06.760 --> 3:11:15.760]  So basically, that was in the days before they just did no bid contracts and engaged in whatever fraud they wanted and paid 100 times what something was worth to their buddy.
[3:11:15.760 --> 3:11:26.760]  I mean, now it's just out and out, total criminality. John McCain goes to England, goes to the Rothschild Palace, raises a couple million dollars, every dollar is a felony.
[3:11:26.760 --> 3:11:35.760]  The news admits it's a felony and he just says, go to hell. I mean, they're just completely lawless now, but please continue.
[3:11:35.760 --> 3:11:46.760]  Well, they were there then. The telecommunications is probably right up there with the absolute rottenest, most corrupt, because I had no idea when I got into that business.
[3:11:46.760 --> 3:11:58.760]  I had to pay up from anywhere from 2 to 5% of the bid to get the job. I was offered money to not complain about losing a bid. I had no idea.
[3:11:58.760 --> 3:12:08.760]  I mean, it was just rotten clear to the top and finally the state of Alaska quit going to bid, just because of me, because I took them to the Supreme Court of Alaska a couple times.
[3:12:08.760 --> 3:12:11.760]  And that's why I got me started doing this.
[3:12:11.760 --> 3:12:26.760]  By the way, just fighting for access TV, payoffs to people. I've got people sent to prison for stealing money, PIs following us, all sorts of threats, cutting our show off cable,
[3:12:26.760 --> 3:12:37.760]  literally turning the switch off. I mean, exactly. I mean, it's just, it's so rotten. It's kind of like a tree. In fact, I have a tree in my backyard that we like.
[3:12:37.760 --> 3:12:44.760]  It's a oak tree. Thought it was healthy. All of a sudden, a big limb just fell off and there's carpenter ants all in it. That's basically us.
[3:12:44.760 --> 3:12:49.760]  We look healthy, but under the surface, we're just nothing but a big fat maggot. Go ahead.
[3:12:49.760 --> 3:12:58.760]  So anyway, I really got involved in the research. I actually got the signatures and I ran under the Patriot Party, which was a break off of Ross Perot,
[3:12:58.760 --> 3:13:08.760]  unknowing that that was taken over by Farrakhan. And so anyway, I ran for governor of the state of Alaska and I saw on the election results.
[3:13:08.760 --> 3:13:17.760]  I saw numbers go backwards. Can you believe that? They were scared, spineless, that I would just give. I mean, I wasn't going to win, but they didn't want the party established.
[3:13:17.760 --> 3:13:24.760]  But so anyway, I really got involved in this heavy because I am a guy that I want to do, I want to know what's going on.
[3:13:24.760 --> 3:13:32.760]  I want the real truth because I, and I was looking, I went all over. I met with the Montana Freeman. I met with the Republic of Texas people.
[3:13:32.760 --> 3:13:38.760]  And, you know, just to see what was really what they were up to, I knew the Montana Freeman personally.
[3:13:38.760 --> 3:13:50.760]  And I mean, because back then I had money and I got hooked up with Dan Medder, which is now deceased. And that's how I got involved in the IRS issues.
[3:13:50.760 --> 3:14:00.760]  And then Greg Pound here in the last year, I got involved with the child custody issues. Before that, I want to talk about, that's what I want to talk about is two subjects.
[3:14:00.760 --> 3:14:08.760]  The horror stories of the child issues and how it's totally lawless. And I've been there. I've watched it. I've been to court. You're right. It's just, it's not even reality.
[3:14:08.760 --> 3:14:15.760]  And then I also want to get into first of these agencies for people to understand how illegitimate this government is.
[3:14:15.760 --> 3:14:25.760]  Well, what I discovered is we have no government. It's been gone a long time because you have to understand the real basics of a constitutional republic.
[3:14:25.760 --> 3:14:33.760]  It's about the people by the people for the people. There are some bright line issues. And by the way, before I forget to say this, the IRS is broke.
[3:14:33.760 --> 3:14:41.760]  It's absolutely, we are, we're attacking it. But the bright line issues for a constitutional republic are quite simple.
[3:14:41.760 --> 3:14:52.760]  And these are tests that must be made because anytime someone comes up to you, it's by what authority are you authorized over my life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, including property?
[3:14:52.760 --> 3:14:58.760]  For a constitutional republic, if we're the sovereign, number one, we must have a contract called our constitution.
[3:14:58.760 --> 3:15:03.760]  There's a limited delegation of power called it's like a limited power of attorney.
[3:15:03.760 --> 3:15:14.760]  Okay, so this person comes up to me. Okay, your office powers and duties must be created either by the constitution or by the legislature defining what exercise, what part of it you're going to do.
[3:15:14.760 --> 3:15:23.760]  So number one, we've got to have the office. That's got to be created. Number two, to qualify for that office, there's only two ways you get there.
[3:15:23.760 --> 3:15:33.760]  You must have a certificate of election from the qualified electors. Or number two, you must have a civil commission, which the signature is the evidence of the appointment.
[3:15:33.760 --> 3:15:39.760]  That was established back in Marbury versus Madison in 1803. So now we've got two ways to get to the office.
[3:15:39.760 --> 3:15:50.760]  Number three, to enter that office, then you, number one, must have an oath of office, but it's an oath of office as a public officer, which means you have discretion.
[3:15:50.760 --> 3:15:55.760]  They just do oath of office. That's for employees, which I'll get to in a minute.
[3:15:55.760 --> 3:16:05.760]  And then when you get into this office, after you've done the oath of office as a public officer, to keep you honest, it was set up to have what's called a performance bond,
[3:16:05.760 --> 3:16:12.760]  which is known as official bond, where you must put up your personal asset to make sure you're honest.
[3:16:12.760 --> 3:16:19.760]  Now in Alaska, we still have all of the official bonds on the books. Would you like to guess how many official bonds we have in Alaska?
[3:16:19.760 --> 3:16:20.760]  None.
[3:16:20.760 --> 3:16:23.760]  You got it, because we had no public officers.
[3:16:23.760 --> 3:16:36.760]  Now, so once that was established, the test that I came to, and over the years with Child custody and the IRS and the president of the Senate, Leida Green, she's not going to run anymore,
[3:16:36.760 --> 3:16:48.760]  but she's president of the Senate out of Genoa, Alaska, said with agencies, this is right out of her office, we fund them, we do not control them, and they have no oversight.
[3:16:48.760 --> 3:16:50.760]  Now, when you go checking...
[3:16:50.760 --> 3:16:58.760]  Let me stop you, just an example for laymen out there, Ralph Winterwood, and this is so important as info is dead on, folks, listen carefully.
[3:16:58.760 --> 3:17:07.760]  LCRA, private group with quasi-governmental power. They own most of the water in Central Texas. They have SWAT teams. They have cameras up all over Austin.
[3:17:07.760 --> 3:17:12.760]  They surveil us all. They arrest people. They surveil people.
[3:17:12.760 --> 3:17:22.760]  They tried to, before I even knew who they were, about 12 years ago, tried to say to the local radio station, we want to spend a bunch of money advertising.
[3:17:22.760 --> 3:17:30.760]  They don't advertise anything. It was just these public service announcements, but we don't like Alex Jones. We don't want it on his show, and we don't want him talking about us.
[3:17:30.760 --> 3:17:37.760]  Well, the program director and actually the manager said, I've never heard of anything like this, but they said they're going to advertise, but don't talk about them.
[3:17:37.760 --> 3:17:42.760]  He said, you say something about them? And I said, no, I don't even know who the LCRA is. That's why I found out.
[3:17:42.760 --> 3:17:50.760]  I mean, that's how diabolical, but I didn't know who they were, and they were trying to make payments to keep me quiet. I mean, do you understand this?
[3:17:50.760 --> 3:17:58.760]  I mean, this folks, it's so shot, you have no idea. They've got the force, they've got the troops, they've got the machine guns, and they rule you.
[3:17:58.760 --> 3:18:01.760]  And they're going to take your property. Go ahead, Ralph.
[3:18:01.760 --> 3:18:10.760]  So now, I've tracked this all the way back, and right after the Civil War, they did some very nefarious things.
[3:18:10.760 --> 3:18:16.760]  They usurped the executive and judicial power, the executive power of the United States.
[3:18:16.760 --> 3:18:21.760]  Fifty-nine years later, finally, the Supreme Court got around and restored part of that.
[3:18:21.760 --> 3:18:27.760]  But what they did is they set up what's called independent establishment, which means they're totally outside the government.
[3:18:27.760 --> 3:18:33.760]  And their reason was, well, they'll be free of all political people that are working on it.
[3:18:33.760 --> 3:18:36.760]  And they'll be a great thing. They're called independent agencies today.
[3:18:36.760 --> 3:18:40.760]  So what these things are, they sit outside of our government.
[3:18:40.760 --> 3:18:48.760]  And what they do is Congress or the state gives marching orders to these agencies.
[3:18:48.760 --> 3:18:57.760]  Now, these agencies, because they are foreign, they're actually, you could call them foreign and domestic enemies,
[3:18:57.760 --> 3:19:05.760]  what they do to rule us then, Congress said we are going to fund these things,
[3:19:05.760 --> 3:19:12.760]  and they will publish in the federal register, which is the federal newspaper, to give us legal notice,
[3:19:12.760 --> 3:19:15.760]  what they are going to do to us.
[3:19:15.760 --> 3:19:20.760]  And in that federal register, these agencies are operating under rules and regulations.
[3:19:20.760 --> 3:19:22.760]  Rules are government and regulations is us.
[3:19:22.760 --> 3:19:25.760]  And they are literally letters of mark.
[3:19:25.760 --> 3:19:33.760]  The Imperium gives them seal to engage in piracy, to engage in forfeiture against the slave enemy.
[3:19:33.760 --> 3:19:38.760]  Just like when the Soviets took over, they called everyone rebels and then gave letters of mark to their agents.
[3:19:38.760 --> 3:19:41.760]  It is, you are the enemy of the government.
[3:19:41.760 --> 3:19:43.760]  They have sent forth armies to eat out your substance.
[3:19:43.760 --> 3:19:44.760]  We'll be right back.
[3:19:44.760 --> 3:19:46.760]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[3:19:46.760 --> 3:19:51.760]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you,
[3:19:51.760 --> 3:19:53.760]  but the symptoms are there.
[3:19:53.760 --> 3:19:58.760]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat
[3:19:58.760 --> 3:20:01.760]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[3:20:01.760 --> 3:20:07.760]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[3:20:07.760 --> 3:20:11.760]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[3:20:11.760 --> 3:20:16.760]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[3:20:16.760 --> 3:20:18.760]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[3:20:18.760 --> 3:20:26.760]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[3:23:43.760 --> 3:23:59.760]  Music
[3:23:59.760 --> 3:24:02.760]  Coming up, Ralph Winterwood is going to get into CPS.
[3:24:02.760 --> 3:24:08.760]  In every hospital, every clinic, they upload with computers by law
[3:24:08.760 --> 3:24:13.760]  to the local health department that carries out the eugenics operation under the federal charter.
[3:24:13.760 --> 3:24:15.760]  They report on your child.
[3:24:15.760 --> 3:24:17.760]  Neighbors, dog bites, some kids are gone.
[3:24:17.760 --> 3:24:21.760]  Child breaks their finger playing Pee Wee Football in front of witnesses.
[3:24:21.760 --> 3:24:23.760]  CPS is coming. Does it matter?
[3:24:23.760 --> 3:24:28.760]  Then, once they get them in the pedophile guild clutches, and we're not joking when we, I mean that,
[3:24:28.760 --> 3:24:33.760]  then the hospitals are not allowed to report on sexual or physical abuse,
[3:24:33.760 --> 3:24:37.760]  and that's why they're five times more likely in fed zone numbers to abuse children.
[3:24:37.760 --> 3:24:39.760]  This is the Seco force.
[3:24:39.760 --> 3:24:41.760]  I mean, this is a guild of pedophiles.
[3:24:41.760 --> 3:24:44.760]  But the globalists do it because they want to break up families,
[3:24:44.760 --> 3:24:47.760]  so they contract with the pedophiles to run this.
[3:24:47.760 --> 3:24:52.760]  And in every state, they've been caught, Texas, Florida, with pedophiles running the whole system.
[3:24:52.760 --> 3:24:55.760]  It's mainstream news, but the health force is just increasing.
[3:24:55.760 --> 3:24:57.760]  But I want to get back into that later.
[3:24:57.760 --> 3:25:00.760]  Right now, Ralph, get into what these agencies are.
[3:25:00.760 --> 3:25:05.760]  Well, what I finally discovered then when they meet none of the qualifications of a public officer
[3:25:05.760 --> 3:25:09.760]  that has discretion, or they meet none of the qualifications of what's called
[3:25:09.760 --> 3:25:13.760]  an officer of the United States or an inferior officer of the United States.
[3:25:13.760 --> 3:25:15.760]  They're all employees.
[3:25:15.760 --> 3:25:17.760]  Now, here, it lies the danger.
[3:25:17.760 --> 3:25:20.760]  You can't fire them. They don't work for us.
[3:25:20.760 --> 3:25:24.760]  You can't hold them accountable. It's almost impossible to sue them.
[3:25:24.760 --> 3:25:30.760]  Now, if they all look like they had turbines like out of Iraq or Iran, we'd know what they were.
[3:25:30.760 --> 3:25:34.760]  But they're sitting out here, and they're funded by the state or by the feds,
[3:25:34.760 --> 3:25:36.760]  and they're all employees.
[3:25:36.760 --> 3:25:38.760]  And that's called ministerial duties.
[3:25:38.760 --> 3:25:41.760]  They hold no public office. They have no discretion.
[3:25:41.760 --> 3:25:44.760]  They're mandated to work by the rules and regulations.
[3:25:44.760 --> 3:25:47.760]  That's the only thing that holds them accountable.
[3:25:47.760 --> 3:25:49.760]  They are no part of a government.
[3:25:49.760 --> 3:25:51.760]  We have no constitutional republic.
[3:25:51.760 --> 3:25:55.760]  If people use this word agency, it's got nothing to do with us.
[3:25:55.760 --> 3:25:59.760]  I researched out the police like in Alaska, the troopers.
[3:25:59.760 --> 3:26:00.760]  They're paramilitary.
[3:26:00.760 --> 3:26:04.760]  This guy get up and testifies his word paramilitary, which means they're outside the government.
[3:26:04.760 --> 3:26:06.760]  They're just like Blackwater.
[3:26:06.760 --> 3:26:11.760]  Ralph, two years ago, I saw the head of the Naval War College get up on C-Span and say,
[3:26:11.760 --> 3:26:14.760]  we work for Wall Street. We don't work for the American people.
[3:26:14.760 --> 3:26:16.760]  We work for the global government.
[3:26:16.760 --> 3:26:19.760]  I mean, it's just right out in the open now.
[3:26:19.760 --> 3:26:21.760]  Well, it is, but the people are...
[3:26:21.760 --> 3:26:24.760]  I'm sorry to say this, but they're litter ignorant and stupid,
[3:26:24.760 --> 3:26:26.760]  and we've got a bunch of them that are, unfortunately, in the stupid area,
[3:26:26.760 --> 3:26:31.760]  because this is so far-fetched, they won't even consider the truth, the facts.
[3:26:31.760 --> 3:26:35.760]  I sit in this court, and I listen to him describe their definition of force,
[3:26:35.760 --> 3:26:39.760]  the Alaska State Troopers, is force until, up until you submit.
[3:26:39.760 --> 3:26:42.760]  And he said, we operate under the use of force continuum.
[3:26:42.760 --> 3:26:44.760]  Level one, officer present.
[3:26:44.760 --> 3:26:46.760]  Level two, orders are military orders.
[3:26:46.760 --> 3:26:49.760]  Level three is our soft-hand techniques.
[3:26:49.760 --> 3:26:51.760]  Level four is pepper spray.
[3:26:51.760 --> 3:26:55.760]  The next level up is we go to batons, and then we go up to guns.
[3:26:55.760 --> 3:26:57.760]  And at whatever level...
[3:26:57.760 --> 3:27:00.760]  And that's why worse than Abu Ghraib torture happens everywhere.
[3:27:00.760 --> 3:27:04.760]  I have video in martial law in my film with them breaking men and women's arms
[3:27:04.760 --> 3:27:06.760]  for not getting up off a sidewalk.
[3:27:06.760 --> 3:27:10.760]  And then now, in Canada, they say, if they catch you without a ticket on a train or a bus,
[3:27:10.760 --> 3:27:14.760]  it says, you are tasered for punishment, and the police chief came out and said,
[3:27:14.760 --> 3:27:16.760]  yes, we now punish you.
[3:27:16.760 --> 3:27:19.760]  I mean, that's Judge Dredd. They now punish you.
[3:27:19.760 --> 3:27:21.760]  Well, they don't work for us.
[3:27:21.760 --> 3:27:25.760]  And right out of the wassaila police manual, I got, it says, we are professionals
[3:27:25.760 --> 3:27:27.760]  at making citizens arrest.
[3:27:27.760 --> 3:27:30.760]  They have no police power. It says they have no police power.
[3:27:30.760 --> 3:27:32.760]  They're hired guns, just like...
[3:27:32.760 --> 3:27:35.760]  By the way, these new auxiliary police in England say the same thing.
[3:27:35.760 --> 3:27:38.760]  They say, we're authorized under English common law.
[3:27:38.760 --> 3:27:42.760]  But see, then they tell us we can't exercise our common law.
[3:27:42.760 --> 3:27:47.760]  That's true. And the other part of this is, see, they can beat the living daylights out of us.
[3:27:47.760 --> 3:27:51.760]  If you touch one of them, you can be charged with a crime.
[3:27:51.760 --> 3:27:54.760]  You just touch them. Just touch your finger. I've already tried these things.
[3:27:54.760 --> 3:27:56.760]  It's a wonderland for control-free cowards.
[3:27:56.760 --> 3:27:59.760]  They get to rape, kill, abuse, rape children.
[3:27:59.760 --> 3:28:02.760]  I mean, folks, when you read about the Texas Youth Commission,
[3:28:02.760 --> 3:28:06.760]  where every facility was raping children, making films,
[3:28:06.760 --> 3:28:10.760]  having public rape parties, public gladiatorial fights,
[3:28:10.760 --> 3:28:13.760]  I mean, just something out of a nightmare.
[3:28:13.760 --> 3:28:19.760]  It's just, I call them the Hell Force, Ralph. I mean, the Hell Force is among us.
[3:28:19.760 --> 3:28:23.760]  Well, let me tell you this. Right out of the federal register,
[3:28:23.760 --> 3:28:25.760]  first of all, there's an act of Congress.
[3:28:25.760 --> 3:28:31.760]  I think it's 97 or 98 under Clinton that says they are going to average out
[3:28:31.760 --> 3:28:33.760]  the three-year baseline of kids to adopt.
[3:28:33.760 --> 3:28:37.760]  There's mandatory requirements for the feds for if you're in the state program
[3:28:37.760 --> 3:28:40.760]  to get money to adopt.
[3:28:40.760 --> 3:28:45.760]  And they give $4,000 for the healthy one, $2,000 for the crippled one.
[3:28:45.760 --> 3:28:47.760]  And that's above the baseline.
[3:28:47.760 --> 3:28:49.760]  So every year, the baseline keeps increasing.
[3:28:49.760 --> 3:28:53.760]  So that's an automatic self-destruct for our families.
[3:28:53.760 --> 3:28:55.760]  And number two in the federal register.
[3:28:55.760 --> 3:28:58.760]  Let me be clear. The bounty for the number of children that must be kidnapped
[3:28:58.760 --> 3:29:02.760]  is increasing, and they just have a cold-blooded bounty,
[3:29:02.760 --> 3:29:06.760]  and they go after nice families because CPS is found.
[3:29:06.760 --> 3:29:08.760]  Why trash will blow your head off?
[3:29:08.760 --> 3:29:12.760]  Okay. They don't like messing with tough types or criminal types.
[3:29:12.760 --> 3:29:15.760]  They like the nice little family that keeps thinking,
[3:29:15.760 --> 3:29:18.760]  well, I'm innocent. I'll get my child back someday.
[3:29:18.760 --> 3:29:21.760]  And the fat pedophile says, yeah, you'll get him back someday.
[3:29:21.760 --> 3:29:27.760]  And you can just see him, big, fat, disgusting, demonic, child-raping, built from hell.
[3:29:27.760 --> 3:29:31.760]  The last, what, five, six heads of the CPS in Florida have been child-rapist.
[3:29:31.760 --> 3:29:34.760]  You must be a convicted child-rapist to get a job.
[3:29:34.760 --> 3:29:37.760]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.

[3:30:47.760 --> 3:30:50.760]  Last month, Ready Reserve Foods stated that by fall,
[3:30:50.760 --> 3:30:53.760]  food would be in short supply, and the government would be forced
[3:30:53.760 --> 3:30:57.760]  to impose controls on food and food distribution because of civil unrest and panic.
[3:30:57.760 --> 3:31:02.760]  Well, the floods in the heartland of America have all but assured this will happen.
[3:31:02.760 --> 3:31:06.760]  It is estimated that 5 million acres of farmland will not be producing
[3:31:06.760 --> 3:31:09.760]  over 700 million bushels of corn alone.
[3:31:09.760 --> 3:31:13.760]  If you have ever thought about storing food, now is the time to do so.

[3:31:22.760 --> 3:31:26.760]  stated on June 6th that the USDA has only enough wheat stored to make
[3:31:26.760 --> 3:31:29.760]  one half of a loaf of bread for every American.

[3:32:10.760 --> 3:32:13.760]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th,
[3:32:13.760 --> 3:32:16.760]  a global awakening has taken place.
[3:32:16.760 --> 3:32:23.760]  An inside job? How dare you?
[3:32:23.760 --> 3:32:26.760]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:32:26.760 --> 3:32:29.760]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[3:32:29.760 --> 3:32:32.760]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years,
[3:32:32.760 --> 3:32:35.760]  we will be here on the 10th anniversary of...
[3:32:35.760 --> 3:32:40.760]  Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now, or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:32:40.760 --> 3:33:06.760]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[3:33:06.760 --> 3:33:10.760]  I remember about nine years ago, I called into other radio shows crying as I drove home,
[3:33:10.760 --> 3:33:12.760]  because it really hit me then.
[3:33:12.760 --> 3:33:15.760]  It's been quite a journey, you know, that's why I have all this anger.
[3:33:15.760 --> 3:33:18.760]  They went down and snatched this woman's baby for no reason,
[3:33:18.760 --> 3:33:25.760]  and then filed a name from a year before of a three-year-old child, totally separate from her.
[3:33:25.760 --> 3:33:28.760]  And the reason I got Ralph Vaughn as I was listening to this radio show one Sunday
[3:33:28.760 --> 3:33:31.760]  or locally in Austin driving, and I heard him talk about in these cases
[3:33:31.760 --> 3:33:34.760]  how they file wrong names, they're not even filled outright,
[3:33:34.760 --> 3:33:39.760]  the courts aren't real, it's all private contractors, and I have it on tape.
[3:33:39.760 --> 3:33:41.760]  I got copies of it, I showed it on my TV show.
[3:33:41.760 --> 3:33:46.760]  It's on YouTube, you know, from eight, nine years ago, Mike Hansen got it and re-uploaded it.
[3:33:46.760 --> 3:33:50.760]  Where, imagine for me, I didn't know how bad the government was then,
[3:33:50.760 --> 3:33:53.760]  or this private murder gangs that call themselves government.
[3:33:53.760 --> 3:33:55.760]  I mean, they don't even file...
[3:33:55.760 --> 3:33:59.760]  They don't even care, they just laugh and file the same case with other people's names.
[3:33:59.760 --> 3:34:02.760]  I mean, it's Ralph getting into the horrors of these people,
[3:34:02.760 --> 3:34:05.760]  because for all the crimes of these private agencies,
[3:34:05.760 --> 3:34:09.760]  carrying this out with the private federal reserve with government seal and signant,
[3:34:09.760 --> 3:34:12.760]  the stuff happening to the children is the mother load.
[3:34:12.760 --> 3:34:16.760]  It's over, what, a million for a year the pedophile ring seizes.
[3:34:16.760 --> 3:34:19.760]  But again, it's the bankers carrying out eugenics,
[3:34:19.760 --> 3:34:22.760]  they just hire the pedophile rings to carry out the ops,
[3:34:22.760 --> 3:34:25.760]  then the family judges who aren't real judges,
[3:34:25.760 --> 3:34:29.760]  have family centers named after them in the local cities as they sit.
[3:34:29.760 --> 3:34:35.760]  It's always the same, it's always a butch-cut demon woman running it,
[3:34:35.760 --> 3:34:39.760]  with fat, nilly men as their worker bees.
[3:34:39.760 --> 3:34:42.760]  It even operates like a hive, go ahead.
[3:34:42.760 --> 3:34:46.760]  Well, like I said when we discovered this,
[3:34:46.760 --> 3:34:50.760]  it is government-sponsored sexual abuse pedophile,
[3:34:50.760 --> 3:34:53.760]  because they have, the government is 6%,
[3:34:53.760 --> 3:34:56.760]  Florida happens to be one out of every 20 child.
[3:34:56.760 --> 3:34:59.760]  Legally can be sexually or physically abused,
[3:34:59.760 --> 3:35:01.760]  and they pay you money for this.
[3:35:01.760 --> 3:35:03.760]  That's unbelievable.
[3:35:03.760 --> 3:35:06.760]  Give people the details of these state contracts.
[3:35:06.760 --> 3:35:08.760]  Well, they're called cooperative agreements,
[3:35:08.760 --> 3:35:11.760]  and for the states, they have one with a court,
[3:35:11.760 --> 3:35:15.760]  and the judge is bound to, he's supposed to abide by the regulations,
[3:35:15.760 --> 3:35:18.760]  so that everybody gets their cut of the money.
[3:35:18.760 --> 3:35:21.760]  And the sheriff has a contract, it's cooperative agreements,
[3:35:21.760 --> 3:35:24.760]  usually with the county commissioners, he is an independent contractor,
[3:35:24.760 --> 3:35:29.760]  and to get away from the liability part of this under the 11th amendment,
[3:35:29.760 --> 3:35:32.760]  what the state does, like in Florida and everywhere,
[3:35:32.760 --> 3:35:34.760]  they will hire, like the YMCA down there,
[3:35:34.760 --> 3:35:37.760]  they hire them as an independent contractor,
[3:35:37.760 --> 3:35:39.760]  and they give them goals.
[3:35:39.760 --> 3:35:42.760]  You must have this many children in the system,
[3:35:42.760 --> 3:35:44.760]  you must adopt out this many children,
[3:35:44.760 --> 3:35:48.760]  and if you don't, you could be penalized up to 10% of them.
[3:35:48.760 --> 3:35:52.760]  And to be clear, they then spied for kids to grab within their own systems,
[3:35:52.760 --> 3:35:56.760]  the hospitals, the schools, everything is pedophile ring-run,
[3:35:56.760 --> 3:35:58.760]  or then they have criminals that just want money,
[3:35:58.760 --> 3:36:02.760]  and so they're all spying with a mark on your kids everywhere.
[3:36:02.760 --> 3:36:05.760]  Well, what we found down there in Florida,
[3:36:05.760 --> 3:36:08.760]  they actually have it highlighted in the hospital side,
[3:36:08.760 --> 3:36:11.760]  that's part to use, because every time you take a child to the hospital,
[3:36:11.760 --> 3:36:14.760]  young children that automatically goes over to the child custody,
[3:36:14.760 --> 3:36:17.760]  and they have quotas, so they can just pick and choose
[3:36:17.760 --> 3:36:20.760]  what kind of child they want, they find an excuse,
[3:36:20.760 --> 3:36:23.760]  because there is no excuse to have a bruise or any accent.
[3:36:23.760 --> 3:36:25.760]  Every one of them is covered by child custody,
[3:36:25.760 --> 3:36:27.760]  so they just come out and say,
[3:36:27.760 --> 3:36:30.760]  well, let's see, we need, like, Greg, we need four or four kids,
[3:36:30.760 --> 3:36:32.760]  oh, they're good kids, this is good stuff here,
[3:36:32.760 --> 3:36:35.760]  we can sell them out, which they've already adopted them out,
[3:36:35.760 --> 3:36:38.760]  and we got a minimum of $16,000, actually in Florida then,
[3:36:38.760 --> 3:36:43.760]  they've also set it up so that if the Florida state employees get them,
[3:36:43.760 --> 3:36:47.760]  they get $5,000 or $10,000 per head just to adopt them out,
[3:36:47.760 --> 3:36:50.760]  and then, of course, the state gets around and pays for help
[3:36:50.760 --> 3:36:52.760]  with the education and the medical,
[3:36:52.760 --> 3:36:55.760]  so we take these kids that are in the Christian movement,
[3:36:55.760 --> 3:36:57.760]  why, and at home schooling,
[3:36:57.760 --> 3:37:00.760]  and we're going to reestablish them over on our side.
[3:37:00.760 --> 3:37:02.760]  Let's be clear, in the state of California,
[3:37:02.760 --> 3:37:04.760]  as you know, three months ago,
[3:37:04.760 --> 3:37:07.760]  ruled that the state court said, parents are not parents,
[3:37:07.760 --> 3:37:10.760]  it is abusive to not have them in school,
[3:37:10.760 --> 3:37:13.760]  they will be taken, home schooling is illegal.
[3:37:13.760 --> 3:37:15.760]  They said, you have to have a teaching certificate
[3:37:15.760 --> 3:37:17.760]  and have a child in your own home,
[3:37:17.760 --> 3:37:20.760]  and they also say that home schooling is abuse,
[3:37:20.760 --> 3:37:22.760]  even though they're all the top scores.
[3:37:22.760 --> 3:37:26.760]  God, this is the hell force, this is the hell force.
[3:37:26.760 --> 3:37:31.760]  Well, there is a root to this particular problem,
[3:37:31.760 --> 3:37:34.760]  the root of the tree that produces the poisonous root,
[3:37:34.760 --> 3:37:36.760]  it started in 1866,
[3:37:36.760 --> 3:37:39.760]  and they created a citizen of the United States,
[3:37:39.760 --> 3:37:42.760]  out of thin air, they just made it up.
[3:37:42.760 --> 3:37:45.760]  It was strictly for the Negroes, the extreme court has said so,
[3:37:45.760 --> 3:37:46.760]  and what they said.
[3:37:46.760 --> 3:37:47.760]  Now, this is pretty astounding,
[3:37:47.760 --> 3:37:49.760]  and you can check it out on the internet,
[3:37:49.760 --> 3:37:52.760]  because all my stuff I do is, I document.
[3:37:52.760 --> 3:37:54.760]  Now, give out your website, give out your email.
[3:37:54.760 --> 3:38:02.760]  My email is Ralph R-A-L-P-H at justbelly-J-U-S-B-E-L-L-I dot com,
[3:38:02.760 --> 3:38:05.760]  and justbelly.com is my home page,
[3:38:05.760 --> 3:38:10.760]  and I have a special list, too, where I put out documents
[3:38:10.760 --> 3:38:12.760]  so that you don't have to go look for it.
[3:38:12.760 --> 3:38:15.760]  Tell us what justbelly means, or justbelly.
[3:38:15.760 --> 3:38:18.760]  It means law of war, because they're waging war on the people.
[3:38:18.760 --> 3:38:19.760]  That's right, and they state that,
[3:38:19.760 --> 3:38:24.760]  letter of Mark, we are enemy, rebels, and savages to be exterminated.
[3:38:24.760 --> 3:38:25.760]  Go ahead.
[3:38:25.760 --> 3:38:26.760]  That's what they're doing.
[3:38:26.760 --> 3:38:29.760]  Stated, letter of Mark, go ahead.
[3:38:29.760 --> 3:38:33.760]  And the root of the tree that produces this poisonous fruit,
[3:38:33.760 --> 3:38:36.760]  all we've got to do, everybody's got to look in the mirror,
[3:38:36.760 --> 3:38:39.760]  because most people still don't know that the Federal Reserve
[3:38:39.760 --> 3:38:42.760]  has not got nothing to do with our government.
[3:38:42.760 --> 3:38:43.760]  Well, guess what?
[3:38:43.760 --> 3:38:47.760]  A citizen of the United States has nothing to do with our government either.
[3:38:47.760 --> 3:38:49.760]  That was created 1866.
[3:38:49.760 --> 3:38:54.760]  It was memorialized in the 14th Amendment in 1868,
[3:38:54.760 --> 3:38:58.760]  and then in 1870, they quietly made it so that the blacks
[3:38:58.760 --> 3:39:00.760]  were exactly equal to the whites.
[3:39:00.760 --> 3:39:04.760]  Of course, we are, everybody thinks they're a citizen of the United States.
[3:39:04.760 --> 3:39:05.760]  Well, what they said.
[3:39:05.760 --> 3:39:09.760]  They're not raised up, everyone was brought down.
[3:39:09.760 --> 3:39:11.760]  Well, we work with affectionate law.
[3:39:11.760 --> 3:39:13.760]  If they said everybody's going to be Santa Claus,
[3:39:13.760 --> 3:39:15.760]  and we're going to have root off in every garage,
[3:39:15.760 --> 3:39:17.760]  we'd say, no, no, no, that's not so.
[3:39:17.760 --> 3:39:20.760]  But everybody thinks they're a citizen of the United States,
[3:39:20.760 --> 3:39:25.760]  and what it's found today in Title 42, 1981, 82, and 88.
[3:39:25.760 --> 3:39:26.760]  And here's what it says.
[3:39:26.760 --> 3:39:28.760]  This is astounding.
[3:39:28.760 --> 3:39:32.760]  Congress is going to grant you the benefit of to sue and be sued
[3:39:32.760 --> 3:39:36.760]  for personal or private and personal property to write the contract
[3:39:36.760 --> 3:39:40.760]  and to have the same rights as enjoyed by white citizens.
[3:39:40.760 --> 3:39:42.760]  Does that sound just a little racist?
[3:39:42.760 --> 3:39:44.760]  And that is what a citizen of the United States is.
[3:39:44.760 --> 3:39:47.760]  It's still there today in the code.
[3:39:47.760 --> 3:39:48.760]  Unbelievable, isn't it?
[3:39:48.760 --> 3:39:52.760]  And the Supreme Court said, if you take the status, this benefit,
[3:39:52.760 --> 3:39:55.760]  you then have no right to any court of law
[3:39:55.760 --> 3:39:57.760]  and you have no right to a remedy.
[3:39:57.760 --> 3:39:58.760]  That's bad cop.
[3:39:58.760 --> 3:40:02.760]  Do you a ward of the state or a chattel?
[3:40:02.760 --> 3:40:03.760]  Well, it's like you have a child.
[3:40:03.760 --> 3:40:05.760]  You have a child at home, you say, OK, I'm going to get around
[3:40:05.760 --> 3:40:07.760]  and I'll give you a dollar, do the dishes.
[3:40:07.760 --> 3:40:08.760]  No, you pissed me off.
[3:40:08.760 --> 3:40:10.760]  I'm not going to give you any money at all.
[3:40:10.760 --> 3:40:12.760]  There's no remedy for the child.
[3:40:12.760 --> 3:40:13.760]  And that's what we've done.
[3:40:13.760 --> 3:40:14.760]  We have surrendered.
[3:40:14.760 --> 3:40:17.760]  We have sold our birthright for a bowl of porridge.
[3:40:17.760 --> 3:40:20.760]  We've been hoodwinked.
[3:40:20.760 --> 3:40:22.760]  And that's our problem today.
[3:40:22.760 --> 3:40:26.760]  And the foolish cops and workers that carry all this out
[3:40:26.760 --> 3:40:30.760]  are having their water and food and everything poisoned publicly.
[3:40:30.760 --> 3:40:32.760]  And it's just they love dying of cancer.
[3:40:32.760 --> 3:40:34.760]  They love being slaves.
[3:40:34.760 --> 3:40:36.760]  But the average cop is just completely ignorant.
[3:40:36.760 --> 3:40:40.760]  They just have no idea what they're part of now.
[3:40:40.760 --> 3:40:43.760]  And not even all social workers are in the wicked guild.
[3:40:43.760 --> 3:40:46.760]  But now they're snatching old people and taking their money.
[3:40:46.760 --> 3:40:50.760]  I mean, now it's just, my God, we're in hell.
[3:40:50.760 --> 3:40:55.760]  Well, the thing is, you give people with no accountability
[3:40:55.760 --> 3:40:57.760]  what they perceive as power.
[3:40:57.760 --> 3:41:00.760]  And we got Hitler's like Hitler never had Hitler's in Germany.
[3:41:00.760 --> 3:41:03.760]  God, there was only one of that suckery in Germany.
[3:41:03.760 --> 3:41:05.760]  We got them all over out here because these people,
[3:41:05.760 --> 3:41:07.760]  there's no accountability.
[3:41:07.760 --> 3:41:08.760]  They just do whatever they want.
[3:41:08.760 --> 3:41:10.760]  And they're called agents.
[3:41:10.760 --> 3:41:14.760]  And that's why they're moving matrix because they can just appear anywhere.
[3:41:14.760 --> 3:41:18.760]  And when I finally figured this out, we have no government.
[3:41:18.760 --> 3:41:19.760]  It's gone, folks.
[3:41:19.760 --> 3:41:22.760]  It's because everybody uses the word agency.
[3:41:22.760 --> 3:41:27.760]  I got news for all the crooks and agencies in uniform who think it's all funny.
[3:41:27.760 --> 3:41:29.760]  Your masters are going to hurt you bad.
[3:41:29.760 --> 3:41:31.760]  You think you're part of the system.
[3:41:31.760 --> 3:41:32.760]  You're going to find out.
[3:41:32.760 --> 3:41:33.760]  Keep laughing.
[3:41:33.760 --> 3:41:34.760]  Keep laughing.
[3:41:34.760 --> 3:41:37.760]  I mean, Ralph, here's the problem at the top of the pyramid.
[3:41:37.760 --> 3:41:40.760]  I'm sure you know about all the thousands of admitted chemical, biological,
[3:41:40.760 --> 3:41:43.760]  radiological tasks on the troops and police and others.
[3:41:43.760 --> 3:41:48.760]  They kill our troops all the time for 60 years in test
[3:41:48.760 --> 3:41:51.760]  to create other cadres of military that will do the killing
[3:41:51.760 --> 3:41:53.760]  just as a test.
[3:41:53.760 --> 3:41:57.760]  And it's an admitted declassified fact and the public can't figure out
[3:41:57.760 --> 3:42:00.760]  that, of course, they carried out 9-11.
[3:42:00.760 --> 3:42:03.760]  I mean, if our government were to radiate 4,500 children,
[3:42:03.760 --> 3:42:08.760]  U.S. children frying them to death just to test radiation systems,
[3:42:08.760 --> 3:42:10.760]  oh, but they wouldn't kill you on 9-11.
[3:42:10.760 --> 3:42:15.760]  I mean, it's a wonderland for psychos, isn't it?
[3:42:15.760 --> 3:42:16.760]  Well, it is.
[3:42:16.760 --> 3:42:21.760]  And you know, it's just like, I look for black and white issues.
[3:42:21.760 --> 3:42:23.760]  What I call a bright light.
[3:42:23.760 --> 3:42:24.760]  Oklahoma City.
[3:42:24.760 --> 3:42:26.760]  They had all kinds of video cameras.
[3:42:26.760 --> 3:42:27.760]  You know what's missing in Oklahoma City?
[3:42:27.760 --> 3:42:29.760]  There's no hole in the ground out in front.
[3:42:29.760 --> 3:42:31.760]  So therefore, there was no fertilizer bomb.
[3:42:31.760 --> 3:42:33.760]  It's all a fricking lie.
[3:42:33.760 --> 3:42:36.760]  And they won't release the videos and the FBI that's seen it say that.
[3:42:36.760 --> 3:42:40.760]  No, but these are the TV camera videos of all the different
[3:42:40.760 --> 3:42:41.760]  out of the helicopters.
[3:42:41.760 --> 3:42:42.760]  They were flying around.
[3:42:42.760 --> 3:42:43.760]  I know those.
[3:42:43.760 --> 3:42:44.760]  I agree.
[3:42:44.760 --> 3:42:45.760]  There's no hole.
[3:42:45.760 --> 3:42:46.760]  I agree.
[3:42:46.760 --> 3:42:47.760]  I'm saying.
[3:42:47.760 --> 3:42:48.760]  But then the close-up videos, they seized.
[3:42:48.760 --> 3:42:49.760]  Yeah.
[3:42:49.760 --> 3:42:50.760]  Yeah.
[3:42:50.760 --> 3:42:51.760]  You go to 9-11.
[3:42:51.760 --> 3:42:52.760]  The Pentagon.
[3:42:52.760 --> 3:42:53.760]  There's no plane.
[3:42:53.760 --> 3:42:54.760]  There's no motors.
[3:42:54.760 --> 3:42:56.760]  And there's no people.
[3:42:56.760 --> 3:42:57.760]  And the towers.
[3:42:57.760 --> 3:43:00.260]  There's never been a steel building come down yet.
[3:43:00.260 --> 3:43:02.760]  And two of them came down in the same day within hours.
[3:43:02.760 --> 3:43:05.760]  And then the other building seven, you can see it go down.
[3:43:05.760 --> 3:43:09.760]  And we'd listen to Dan, rather, or some other idiot.
[3:43:09.760 --> 3:43:10.760]  Here's an example.
[3:43:10.760 --> 3:43:13.260]  The Gardasil vaccine admittedly kills people.
[3:43:13.260 --> 3:43:14.760]  They admit it in their own insert.
[3:43:14.760 --> 3:43:16.760]  It says, this gives you cancer.
[3:43:16.760 --> 3:43:17.760]  This kills you.
[3:43:17.760 --> 3:43:19.760]  And they run out and inject themselves.
[3:43:19.760 --> 3:43:20.760]  Have you heard the latest?
[3:43:20.760 --> 3:43:23.760]  They're going to put three to eight-year-olds on statin,
[3:43:23.760 --> 3:43:24.760]  cluster-roll drugs?
[3:43:24.760 --> 3:43:25.760]  Oh, God.
[3:43:25.760 --> 3:43:28.760]  I mean, it's just, it's hell-force, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:43:28.760 --> 3:43:29.760]  You understand?
[3:43:29.760 --> 3:43:34.760]  Well, there's two interesting things that I was watching.
[3:43:34.760 --> 3:43:37.760]  One is I watched what happened in Texas when they kidnapped.
[3:43:37.760 --> 3:43:38.760]  And that's what they're doing.
[3:43:38.760 --> 3:43:41.760]  They're kidnapping children for money, for slavery.
[3:43:41.760 --> 3:43:44.760]  They kidnap them, hold them for ransom, and they sell them off.
[3:43:44.760 --> 3:43:48.760]  The interesting part is, what happened in Texas when they took all those children?
[3:43:48.760 --> 3:43:50.760]  They filed a mandamus.
[3:43:50.760 --> 3:43:55.760]  And a mandamus is to obey your rules and regulations.
[3:43:55.760 --> 3:43:57.760]  Now, this is what I've come up with.
[3:43:57.760 --> 3:44:00.760]  And this week, we are finally attacking the IRS.
[3:44:00.760 --> 3:44:04.760]  Because they must follow their rules and regulations.
[3:44:04.760 --> 3:44:07.760]  That's the only thing that holds them accountable.
[3:44:07.760 --> 3:44:09.760]  The code laws is a waste of time.
[3:44:09.760 --> 3:44:11.760]  That's just the marching orders.
[3:44:11.760 --> 3:44:14.760]  The statutes are the, they call them statutes or the state.
[3:44:14.760 --> 3:44:15.760]  It's all baloney.
[3:44:15.760 --> 3:44:17.760]  They are not bound by it.
[3:44:17.760 --> 3:44:22.760]  The only thing, the courts are bound by, the only thing, the agencies are bound by it.
[3:44:22.760 --> 3:44:26.760]  The only thing that the agents are bound by is what's published in the federal register.
[3:44:26.760 --> 3:44:28.760]  And I know there is some success with that.
[3:44:28.760 --> 3:44:34.760]  The problem is that they will only accept that from higher directives of someone higher at the totem pole.
[3:44:34.760 --> 3:44:38.760]  And these Mormons had a boatload of money and the government's so hated now.
[3:44:38.760 --> 3:44:41.760]  It was a PR backfire.
[3:44:41.760 --> 3:44:48.760]  My whole issue is, is that they selectively enforce even their own codes and regulations, as you know.
[3:44:48.760 --> 3:44:49.760]  Well, they do.
[3:44:49.760 --> 3:44:51.760]  But I've been jerking the judge around here.
[3:44:51.760 --> 3:44:53.760]  I provide research to material that we're going to fight this.
[3:44:53.760 --> 3:44:56.760]  And we've been starting to now to jerk these judges around.
[3:44:56.760 --> 3:45:01.760]  I've got two summary judgments on the killed commercial stuff here in the last three weeks.
[3:45:01.760 --> 3:45:04.760]  But we're going to see how this plays out.
[3:45:04.760 --> 3:45:10.760]  Because this is the only thing that binds these people because they don't work for us.
[3:45:10.760 --> 3:45:18.760]  Now getting back to the hell force, let's just go over the makeup of the family destruction services,
[3:45:18.760 --> 3:45:22.760]  their own books they take in college, say the families of disease, to be eradicated.
[3:45:22.760 --> 3:45:24.760]  We provided all those to you.
[3:45:24.760 --> 3:45:28.760]  So their job, eradicate the family, break down homeschoolers.
[3:45:28.760 --> 3:45:31.760]  They viciously hate Christians.
[3:45:31.760 --> 3:45:42.760]  Let's go over that how that particular mercenary force operates and how illegitimate they are.
[3:45:42.760 --> 3:45:52.760]  Well, like I say, it is because Congress has set this up and they can target any group that they want to tear apart.
[3:45:52.760 --> 3:45:55.760]  Number one, they must tear apart the families.
[3:45:55.760 --> 3:45:59.760]  So they have set up the adoption part that we have.
[3:45:59.760 --> 3:46:02.760]  It's something short of bounty hunting.
[3:46:02.760 --> 3:46:04.760]  They offer money for every child.
[3:46:04.760 --> 3:46:07.760]  If you get over this amount, you start making money.
[3:46:07.760 --> 3:46:11.760]  And that means that these child custody folks then they can hire more of them.
[3:46:11.760 --> 3:46:13.760]  That means your job is secure.
[3:46:13.760 --> 3:46:16.760]  So I mean, these people are, they're going to do it.
[3:46:16.760 --> 3:46:18.760]  And that's what they do.
[3:46:18.760 --> 3:46:21.760]  It's growing like a flesh-eating bacteria infection.
[3:46:21.760 --> 3:46:23.760]  It's exponentially growing.
[3:46:23.760 --> 3:46:25.760]  It's like mold eating a whole loaf of bread.
[3:46:25.760 --> 3:46:26.760]  It's like cancer.
[3:46:26.760 --> 3:46:28.760]  They're just going wild in our blood.
[3:46:28.760 --> 3:46:35.760]  Well, it's like, okay, the Act of Congress says we take the average of a three-year, the last three years baseline.
[3:46:35.760 --> 3:46:37.760]  Now we take the next three years.
[3:46:37.760 --> 3:46:38.760]  Well, the next year is higher.
[3:46:38.760 --> 3:46:43.760]  So that means we have to kill, we have to kidnap more kids to keep our jobs.
[3:46:43.760 --> 3:46:44.760]  And so then we do that.
[3:46:44.760 --> 3:46:51.760]  So every year it's an automatic setup means that we are going to destroy the family.
[3:46:51.760 --> 3:46:53.760]  That's right. Clinton accelerated that one in 97.
[3:46:53.760 --> 3:46:54.760]  Explain that.
[3:46:54.760 --> 3:46:58.760]  They have to up the bounty just to get the original money.
[3:46:58.760 --> 3:46:59.760]  Well, right.
[3:46:59.760 --> 3:47:03.760]  And every year the numbers keep going up.
[3:47:03.760 --> 3:47:05.760]  The number of children in the system.
[3:47:05.760 --> 3:47:09.760]  Well, of course, if your job depends on kidnapping your child, what are you going to do?
[3:47:09.760 --> 3:47:10.760]  You're going to go kidnap them.
[3:47:10.760 --> 3:47:11.760]  And where do they find them?
[3:47:11.760 --> 3:47:20.760]  They have the schools and they have the hospitals where they send them the information of any child that had a bruise or anything.
[3:47:20.760 --> 3:47:21.760]  It's worse than that.
[3:47:21.760 --> 3:47:22.760]  Let me give you an example.
[3:47:22.760 --> 3:47:23.760]  Let me give you an example.
[3:47:23.760 --> 3:47:25.760]  You're at the hospital having a baby.
[3:47:25.760 --> 3:47:26.760]  This just happened to me.
[3:47:26.760 --> 3:47:27.760]  And I go there because I know the doctor.
[3:47:27.760 --> 3:47:28.760]  She's a fan.
[3:47:28.760 --> 3:47:29.760]  She's not bad.
[3:47:29.760 --> 3:47:30.760]  But the system is.
[3:47:30.760 --> 3:47:31.760]  And I've already had three children.
[3:47:31.760 --> 3:47:32.760]  So I know how it is.
[3:47:32.760 --> 3:47:33.760]  And I'm in there.
[3:47:33.760 --> 3:47:35.760]  And she says, oh, honey, you run this down.
[3:47:35.760 --> 3:47:37.760]  The master nurse getting my wife ready to go in.
[3:47:37.760 --> 3:47:40.760]  We run this file down to the floor next to me.
[3:47:40.760 --> 3:47:41.760]  Thank you.
[3:47:41.760 --> 3:47:42.760]  And then I leave.
[3:47:42.760 --> 3:47:44.760]  I wink at my wife and the lady says, how is your home?
[3:47:44.760 --> 3:47:46.760]  I got plenty of money, plenty of food.
[3:47:46.760 --> 3:47:47.760]  That's enough.
[3:47:47.760 --> 3:47:48.760]  Take care.
[3:47:48.760 --> 3:47:49.760]  It's right there.
[3:47:49.760 --> 3:47:50.760]  As your husband, nice to you.
[3:47:50.760 --> 3:47:51.760]  You got a good relationship.
[3:47:51.760 --> 3:47:52.760]  You can tell me, honey.
[3:47:52.760 --> 3:47:54.760]  You got a computer hooked into the police.
[3:47:54.760 --> 3:47:56.760]  Not telling you, not reading your rights.
[3:47:56.760 --> 3:47:57.760]  Nothing.
[3:47:57.760 --> 3:47:58.760]  My wife says, no, we're fine.
[3:47:58.760 --> 3:47:59.760]  We're great.
[3:47:59.760 --> 3:48:00.760]  We're doing good.
[3:48:00.760 --> 3:48:02.760]  And then I come back and the woman slyly on her power trip.
[3:48:02.760 --> 3:48:04.760]  Thank you for doing that.
[3:48:04.760 --> 3:48:07.760]  She's a bucket of pus because she has to do this for a job.
[3:48:07.760 --> 3:48:09.760]  She does it to love it.
[3:48:09.760 --> 3:48:10.760]  She's on her own power trip.
[3:48:10.760 --> 3:48:11.760]  But something's happening.
[3:48:11.760 --> 3:48:13.760]  Now they're going to grab her grandchildren's kids.
[3:48:13.760 --> 3:48:14.760]  Now they're not wanting to do it.
[3:48:14.760 --> 3:48:17.760]  I talked to other nurses about how horrible it is.
[3:48:17.760 --> 3:48:18.760]  They all know what's going on.
[3:48:18.760 --> 3:48:19.760]  Some of them are fans.
[3:48:19.760 --> 3:48:21.760]  But the point is, is this is it.
[3:48:21.760 --> 3:48:24.760]  This is this is you are being reported on everywhere.
[3:48:24.760 --> 3:48:25.760]  Go ahead, Ralph.
[3:48:25.760 --> 3:48:29.760]  Well, like a lady that I've been helping here.
[3:48:29.760 --> 3:48:32.760]  She was in there and they took her child for no reason.
[3:48:32.760 --> 3:48:33.760]  And they adopted it out.
[3:48:33.760 --> 3:48:37.760]  So you had another child down in Montana and they come in there and their big issue.
[3:48:37.760 --> 3:48:39.760]  Well, you've already had one child taken out.
[3:48:39.760 --> 3:48:43.760]  There's no facts, but we don't think you know how to change diapers either.
[3:48:43.760 --> 3:48:47.760]  But the big issue is she happens to be a very large woman around 300 pounds.
[3:48:47.760 --> 3:48:52.760]  So therefore you might damage your child, so therefore we're going to take your child just because of your weight.
[3:48:52.760 --> 3:48:56.760]  And that's what the cashless grid, the cashless tracking system is about.
[3:48:56.760 --> 3:49:00.760]  Well, have you heard now they're talking about taking children in England at the parents hug them in public.
[3:49:00.760 --> 3:49:02.760]  You have to have a license to hug your children.
[3:49:02.760 --> 3:49:04.760]  That's licensing the family.
[3:49:04.760 --> 3:49:10.760]  And then also they feed the children curry at age two in the government preschools.
[3:49:10.760 --> 3:49:12.760]  The dumb mothers take them in, you know, because it's quote free.
[3:49:12.760 --> 3:49:17.760]  And I got it on mainstream news and if the child says yuck when they eat hot food,
[3:49:17.760 --> 3:49:22.760]  police are called because that is a racist term to say yuck to spicy food.
[3:49:22.760 --> 3:49:23.760]  I'm not getting.
[3:49:23.760 --> 3:49:27.760]  Well, the other one of the things that we have to look at here is like in Alaska,
[3:49:27.760 --> 3:49:31.760]  we have a two people got in the pissing match over a tabby.
[3:49:31.760 --> 3:49:33.760]  There was a cat in the business.
[3:49:33.760 --> 3:49:36.760]  And so they actually had a trial by jury of who's going to get the cat.
[3:49:36.760 --> 3:49:40.760]  Now they get around and they take children with no trial by jury.
[3:49:40.760 --> 3:49:42.760]  And no facts.
[3:49:42.760 --> 3:49:47.760]  They just make it up and then they close the initial hearing off.
[3:49:47.760 --> 3:49:48.760]  It does not have any high.
[3:49:48.760 --> 3:49:50.760]  I mean, how did the cat come into this one?
[3:49:50.760 --> 3:49:56.760]  Well, what I was saying is you can have a cat and they will have a trial by jury before you give the ownership of the cat away.
[3:49:56.760 --> 3:49:59.760]  You take children and there's no trial by jury.
[3:49:59.760 --> 3:50:00.760]  That's right.
[3:50:00.760 --> 3:50:06.760]  There's no nothing and explain these family courts are literally part of the just outside.
[3:50:06.760 --> 3:50:10.760]  Well, here's an example here in Austin.
[3:50:10.760 --> 3:50:13.760]  Judge Jean Mayor and her designate set up portable buildings at every school.
[3:50:13.760 --> 3:50:17.760]  Now if a child's like the class three times that doesn't violate state truancy law,
[3:50:17.760 --> 3:50:19.760]  they falsely charge you with that.
[3:50:19.760 --> 3:50:26.760]  But then have the father sign a form saying your child's on probation for doing something that isn't against the law.
[3:50:26.760 --> 3:50:28.760]  And then now you're in the system.
[3:50:28.760 --> 3:50:30.760]  See what I'm saying?
[3:50:30.760 --> 3:50:37.760]  It's a total over though. There's no evidence there's no anything and because the people do not understand don't know how to fight this thing.
[3:50:37.760 --> 3:50:41.760]  And they have a belief system that the cop has police power that these these people.
[3:50:41.760 --> 3:50:42.760]  Stay there. Stay there.
[3:50:42.760 --> 3:50:44.760]  We're going to keep talking during the break.
[3:50:44.760 --> 3:50:49.760]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[3:50:49.760 --> 3:50:54.760]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[3:50:54.760 --> 3:50:55.760]  Hi, folks. Alex Jones here.

[3:51:43.760 --> 3:51:45.760]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[3:51:45.760 --> 3:51:49.760]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[3:51:49.760 --> 3:51:51.760]  But in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope.
[3:51:51.760 --> 3:51:55.760]  The first time in modern history the people are beginning to wake up.
[3:51:55.760 --> 3:52:01.760]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[3:52:01.760 --> 3:52:05.760]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[3:52:05.760 --> 3:52:10.760]  In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[3:52:10.760 --> 3:52:13.760]  Prisonplanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[3:52:42.760 --> 3:52:44.760]  Prisonplanet.tv.
[3:52:44.760 --> 3:52:45.760]  Wake up Protestant America.
[3:52:45.760 --> 3:52:49.760]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[3:52:49.760 --> 3:52:55.760]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting block.
[3:52:55.760 --> 3:52:59.760]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[3:52:59.760 --> 3:53:04.760]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty of conscience.
[3:53:04.760 --> 3:53:09.760]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate.
[3:53:09.760 --> 3:53:13.760]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[3:53:13.760 --> 3:53:15.760]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[3:53:15.760 --> 3:53:20.760]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[3:53:20.760 --> 3:53:24.760]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[3:53:24.760 --> 3:53:27.760]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[3:53:27.760 --> 3:53:30.760]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late.
[3:53:30.760 --> 3:53:32.760]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[3:53:32.760 --> 3:53:33.760]  Jesus is coming soon.

[3:53:50.760 --> 3:53:52.760]  Yeah, Ralph here in the behind the scenes segment.
[3:53:52.760 --> 3:53:58.760]  I'm going to have him back up soon to really spend time, maybe get him up with some of the people that have gone through this, Mr. Pound and others.
[3:53:58.760 --> 3:54:07.760]  You understand, he goes and fights with the kids CPS has got where they chain them up and maggots are eating them outside and they're raping them, killing them and CPS defends it.
[3:54:07.760 --> 3:54:11.760]  This is a group of people that like to rape and torture kids.
[3:54:11.760 --> 3:54:17.760]  The eugenicists, that's how CPS started, they set it up because they want to break the family up.
[3:54:17.760 --> 3:54:19.760]  But imagine the scum that would do this.
[3:54:19.760 --> 3:54:21.760]  Well, that's who gravitates to do it.
[3:54:21.760 --> 3:54:32.760]  And my God, being a carpet cleaner for a summer, I saw a lot of these, a lot of these smaller foster home houses where the kids are on dirty mattresses.
[3:54:32.760 --> 3:54:37.760]  You got these dope head drug addict, pedophile parents, waddling around in the house.
[3:54:37.760 --> 3:54:40.760]  And I just can't handle it anymore.
[3:54:40.760 --> 3:54:41.760]  I just can't handle it.
[3:54:41.760 --> 3:54:42.760]  These bastards rule.
[3:54:42.760 --> 3:54:45.760]  They suck our blood and they're going to go to hell.
[3:54:45.760 --> 3:54:48.760]  I know you're evil, you murdering bastards.
[3:54:48.760 --> 3:54:52.760]  Ralph Winterwood, give out your website, spell it out, and we're going to have you up again soon.
[3:54:52.760 --> 3:54:54.760]  Yeah, it's Jess Belly.
[3:54:54.760 --> 3:54:55.760]  It's a Latin word.
[3:54:55.760 --> 3:54:58.760]  J is in Jack, J-U-S, and then like a bell, bravo.
[3:54:58.760 --> 3:55:01.760]  It's J-U-S-B-E-L-L-I dot com.
[3:55:01.760 --> 3:55:04.760]  And my email is Ralph at Jessbelly dot com.
[3:55:04.760 --> 3:55:05.760]  All right.
[3:55:05.760 --> 3:55:10.760]  I want to set you up next week for two hours and maybe I'll stick a rag and I'm out or something.
[3:55:10.760 --> 3:55:17.760]  I just want to back you up and everything you're saying is true to talk about how to fight these bastards because you found some good effective ways to do it.
[3:55:17.760 --> 3:55:22.760]  And I'm going to be getting George Gordon and a lot of the people on to try to give people some solutions.
[3:55:22.760 --> 3:55:23.760]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[3:55:23.760 --> 3:55:24.760]  Okay.
[3:55:24.760 --> 3:55:26.760]  Thanks for having me and we'll talk to you later.
[3:55:26.760 --> 3:55:27.760]  Absolutely.
[3:55:27.760 --> 3:55:31.760]  Folks, do not be in Florida, Michigan, California, New York state.
[3:55:31.760 --> 3:55:37.760]  I mean, they supply kids to drug testing and pesticide testing in those states.
[3:55:37.760 --> 3:55:39.760]  Texas is bad.
[3:55:39.760 --> 3:55:40.760]  And God help us.
[3:55:40.760 --> 3:55:42.760]  I wish what I was saying wasn't true.
[3:55:42.760 --> 3:55:43.760]  We're out of time.
[3:55:43.760 --> 3:55:50.760]  I want you to stay with us, though, because without these sponsors, we wouldn't exist.
[3:55:50.760 --> 3:55:53.760]  One of them is inner food and inner food is really great stuff.
[3:55:53.760 --> 3:55:54.760]  It's the best green food out there.
[3:55:54.760 --> 3:55:56.760]  I saw my wife taking it this morning.

[3:58:34.760 --> 3:58:42.760]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero and we knew what to do.
[3:58:42.760 --> 3:58:43.760]  Or at least we thought we did.
[3:58:43.760 --> 3:58:50.760]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[3:58:50.760 --> 3:58:59.760]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:58:59.760 --> 3:59:06.760]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[3:59:06.760 --> 3:59:09.760]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
