[00:59.340 --> 01:02.040]  I finally read it because so many listeners mailed it to me over the
[01:02.040 --> 01:06.000]  last year and a half and it's got a lot of new information very well researched
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.280]  a very easy read this is something everybody needs to have we're promoting
[01:10.280 --> 01:14.960]  it and selling it at info wars dot com by Ron McDonald and Robert Rowan they

[01:23.480 --> 01:30.240]  up in the second hour today we also have Wayne Madsen briefly popping in on all
[01:30.240 --> 01:36.160]  the new WikiLeaks stuff obviously Julian Assange has been arrested and I've seen
[01:36.160 --> 01:40.440]  some early news articles about this a few weeks ago but now it's confirmed he
[01:40.440 --> 01:46.580]  had consensual sex with two women but the country that this happened in is so
[01:46.580 --> 01:50.760]  globalist and they do teach at the University of Texas and all over the
[01:50.760 --> 01:57.700]  U.S. that sex between a man and a woman is rape men are inherently evil and they
[01:57.700 --> 02:03.120]  consensually let him have sex with them without a condom they kind of said oh
[02:03.120 --> 02:07.880]  you need to wear a condom they were having a party that they put on for
[02:07.880 --> 02:12.320]  him they had a party after and it turns out that one of these women is
[02:12.320 --> 02:20.000]  confirmed right inside serious CIA operations now I've been talking about
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.840]  them basically flushing their Lee Harvey Oswald down the commode I don't
[02:23.840 --> 02:28.600]  think Julian Assange is a bad guy individually and I don't like to come
[02:28.600 --> 02:34.720]  out and talk bad about people without having serious proof I my shelf have
[02:34.720 --> 02:37.920]  been the victim of people making stuff up about me and lying and
[02:37.920 --> 02:42.160]  exaggerating and twisting so I don't like to bear false witness but I really
[02:42.160 --> 02:46.880]  respect Webster Tarpley and I respect Wayne Madsen but also respect dr. Paul
[02:46.880 --> 02:50.600]  Craig Roberts and he's traveling today so he couldn't come on but he had an
[02:50.600 --> 02:58.600]  editorial out yesterday that we posted on info wars.com titled the loss of
[02:58.600 --> 03:04.160]  Western society's morals in fact I forget the exact headline guys we print
[03:04.160 --> 03:10.160]  that for me what was the headline sorry I thought you were telling me the
[03:10.160 --> 03:16.000]  headline the point is dealing with the fact that regardless of what you think
[03:16.000 --> 03:21.600]  of Julian Assange how has the media turned all this around there's the
[03:21.600 --> 03:25.880]  headline Western civilization has shed its values dr. Paul Craig Roberts
[03:25.880 --> 03:29.920]  published at info wars.com and prison plunder.com and I tend to agree with it
[03:29.920 --> 03:34.360]  regardless of what you think of Julian Assange he may be a good guy maybe a bad
[03:34.360 --> 03:39.680]  guy maybe like most of us a little bit in between you know I don't sit in
[03:39.680 --> 03:44.680]  in judgment without absolute proof on somebody but regardless how has this all
[03:44.680 --> 03:50.240]  been twisted into being about Assange or about how horrible it is that he leaked
[03:50.240 --> 03:56.160]  this stuff he needs to be executed as Bill O'Reilly and others have been
[03:56.160 --> 04:03.320]  promoting instead of wow look at how corrupt our government is and look at
[04:03.320 --> 04:07.080]  how they're paying people off and spying on folks and trying to destabilize
[04:07.080 --> 04:11.600]  things how has it all been turned around and and and could it be out of the
[04:11.600 --> 04:15.960]  tens of thousands of different cables that the media spun and cherry picked
[04:15.960 --> 04:21.720]  the areas they wanted to focus on to then push the globalist agenda this is
[04:21.720 --> 04:28.680]  very sophisticated but there are the George Soros connections that is there
[04:28.680 --> 04:35.080]  and so I'm very suspicious of the whole thing also you couldn't have scripted
[04:35.080 --> 04:40.720]  this better to have him play the part of the victim but then the allegations of
[04:40.720 --> 04:46.080]  rape and molestation then come out are completely asinine and then there's CIA
[04:46.080 --> 04:49.960]  connections this way he looks like Daniel Ellsberg who actually got
[04:49.960 --> 04:54.920]  prosecuted as well but then was exonerated the whole thing plays like
[04:54.920 --> 05:00.600]  a movie we'll be right back after the break stay with us info wars.com

[08:34.760 --> 08:41.440]  to give us his latest take and research on the ongoing and gigantic story of
[08:41.440 --> 08:48.200]  WikiLeaks and the arrest and now denial of bail of mr. Assange and we've got a
[08:48.200 --> 08:52.280]  researcher who's written an amazing book Ron McDonald also co-wrote it with
[08:52.280 --> 08:57.200]  Robert Rowan medical doctor they own it all including you coming up to get into
[08:57.200 --> 09:04.040]  the whole monetary situation in the second hour today okay let me just
[09:04.040 --> 09:07.000]  just mention the different stacks of news I have here that I'm going to cover
[09:07.000 --> 09:11.360]  in detail in this hour and then go back through with our guest in the second and
[09:11.360 --> 09:16.280]  third hour today Republicans have achieved their top goal in Obama tax cut
[09:16.280 --> 09:20.440]  plan we're going to be looking at what these tax cuts really mean overall this
[09:20.440 --> 09:25.240]  is very good news and shows massive grassroots pressure and that's one of the
[09:25.240 --> 09:28.400]  few areas that will cause stimulation because it is people making a hundred
[09:28.400 --> 09:31.480]  thousand dollars a year a hundred twenty five thousand dollars a year
[09:31.480 --> 09:36.400]  individually quarter million a year as couples that hire most people and keep
[09:36.400 --> 09:40.560]  most the small businesses going so that's certainly some positive news but
[09:40.560 --> 09:44.280]  if you don't write off the one point five quadrillion six hundred trillion of
[09:44.280 --> 09:48.000]  that reportedly owed by the American people through fraud the central banks
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.000]  nothing will fix it you know this is a band-aid on a severed leg but still a
[09:53.000 --> 09:57.520]  band-aid I guess with a leg spring gouts of blood is better better than nothing
[09:57.520 --> 10:01.880]  it's it's at least one degree back in the right direction we'll be breaking down
[10:01.880 --> 10:08.240]  the details of that also Americans are outraged as big sis launches DHS
[10:08.240 --> 10:14.000]  invasion of society that's the prison planet dot com headline upon info wars
[10:14.000 --> 10:22.840]  dot com the article gets into the fact that the big sis invasion of Walmart is
[10:22.840 --> 10:29.160]  the open rollout of what Obama announced the civilian security force so we're
[10:29.160 --> 10:33.800]  gonna be talking about that the drudge report is just amazing it is the biggest
[10:33.800 --> 10:39.640]  single news website in the world hands down overall ratings wise I guess the
[10:39.640 --> 10:43.720]  Huffington Post has a few more visitors but they have thousands of articles and
[10:43.720 --> 10:49.920]  videos a day it's all fractured it's a community their drudge is like 30 40
[10:49.920 --> 10:55.280]  articles and that's it and it's almost as big as the Huffington Post so it's
[10:55.280 --> 10:59.760]  just amazing the amount of coverage news gets there and how it sets the agenda
[10:59.760 --> 11:05.960]  now it broke at about 1 o'clock central that they're invading Walmart with the
[11:05.960 --> 11:11.280]  telescreens as we predicted it's now happening literally shouting orders at
[11:11.280 --> 11:17.240]  you and the opening message is big sis telling you to spy on other shoppers but
[11:17.240 --> 11:20.920]  it's going to be now are there illegal guns does your neighbor spank their
[11:20.920 --> 11:25.480]  child you know just someone smoke marijuana your license plates are going
[11:25.480 --> 11:29.040]  to be digital soon with government messages being flashed on them and
[11:29.040 --> 11:32.520]  people that are wanted billboards on the sides of the road are already doing
[11:32.520 --> 11:36.480]  this with toll-free numbers to report illegal guns and quote terrorist then
[11:36.480 --> 11:40.040]  the carpet cleaner this happened to me sees the billboard saying report illegal
[11:40.040 --> 11:43.960]  guns they're in your house and see a gun case and call the police because they
[11:43.960 --> 11:49.960]  think your shotguns illegal I mean this is the total stasi takeover of this
[11:49.960 --> 11:54.000]  nation I want to break down all the facets of that but the point is I got
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.240]  off air yesterday went did some errands before I came back to the office and then
[11:57.240 --> 12:01.600]  did some more errands listened to San Antonio Austin Dallas syndicated in
[12:01.600 --> 12:06.520]  local radio all any of them were covering was the drudge report who just
[12:06.520 --> 12:10.280]  got a press release from big sis about how they're going to put in 800 plus
[12:10.280 --> 12:14.240]  Walmart's telescreens at the checkout counters everywhere we were a captive
[12:14.240 --> 12:18.520]  audience being bossed around by a federal government now putting telescreens out
[12:18.520 --> 12:22.400]  of 1984 in marketplaces I'm going to break this down coming up later after I
[12:22.400 --> 12:26.520]  get into the WikiLeaks info so we're going to get into the economy we're
[12:26.520 --> 12:31.360]  going to get into silver now surging past 30 gold surging to close to its all
[12:31.360 --> 12:36.880]  time high of 1420 plus dollars and the announcements worldwide that they are
[12:36.880 --> 12:40.800]  going to completely basically devalue the dollar like Zimbabwe or Weimar
[12:40.800 --> 12:47.880]  Republic but just finishing up with the fact that I heard mainline talk show
[12:47.880 --> 12:53.200]  hosting this is 1984 this is stasi society if big sis wants me to report
[12:53.200 --> 12:56.400]  something I'll report the fact that I don't trust the government it's out of
[12:56.400 --> 13:01.560]  control everything I was thinking the points I was making yesterday people
[13:01.560 --> 13:06.360]  independently we're all making the exact same points and I saw it on the YouTube
[13:06.360 --> 13:12.400]  comments on the Homeland Security video site 99 plus percent in fact I saw no
[13:12.400 --> 13:16.520]  one yesterday or last night I was obsessed with it reading hundreds and
[13:16.520 --> 13:20.480]  hundreds of comments no one on the official Homeland Security YouTube with
[13:20.480 --> 13:26.920]  her with her message for Walmart that's going into the Walmart's everyone I say
[13:26.920 --> 13:31.520]  99 because there might be one in there I missed everyone said you're a thug it's
[13:31.520 --> 13:35.840]  a takeover this is the domestic police force this is to make us not trust each
[13:35.840 --> 13:40.040]  other but see big government as our mommy and our daddy governor Ridge two
[13:40.040 --> 13:43.680]  years ago or a year and a half ago admitted that the government put out
[13:43.680 --> 13:48.960]  fake terror alerts now why don't you protect the border you which I mean it
[13:48.960 --> 13:56.880]  was America is starting to wake up because when I tune in to Jeff Ward on
[13:56.880 --> 14:01.520]  590 and it sounds like the Alex Jones show and I tune into W. A. I. and San
[14:01.520 --> 14:06.020]  Antonio and it sounds like the Alex Jones show and I tune in to W. A. P. and
[14:06.020 --> 14:10.000]  Dallas and it sounds like the Alex Jones show I mean I pulled in last night
[14:10.000 --> 14:13.940]  about seven at home and was sitting in the car for like 30 minutes just going
[14:13.940 --> 14:18.200]  through the dial every show talking about it now I did hear one one caller to
[14:18.200 --> 14:24.520]  590 he could barely talk out of scores of callers calling in ranting sounding
[14:24.520 --> 14:30.960]  just like yours truly I heard one caller call in and the poor guy literally
[14:30.960 --> 14:35.520]  sounded almost like he was mentally retarded and he was like well you know
[14:35.520 --> 14:39.280]  there are a lot of people so he talked he said there are a lot of people in
[14:39.280 --> 14:44.160]  Walmart eat the biggest wheat Taylor and Al-Qaeda might try to hit it I'm not
[14:44.160 --> 14:50.000]  kidding ladies and gentlemen I got a call Thomas McDonald who runs Ward's
[14:50.000 --> 14:55.240]  show I think he gets in about now and ask him it was when I heard that call it
[14:55.240 --> 15:02.000]  was about 530 or so he'll know the caller it was the one caller and he was
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.520]  because I mean you know I've gotten calls from 590 before and played him here
[15:05.520 --> 15:09.320]  I mean you cannot underestimate the level of the of some people's ignorance
[15:09.320 --> 15:14.320]  he was like Al-Qaeda might try to hit it we need these screams in there because
[15:14.320 --> 15:18.880]  they're gonna try to hit us inside the Walmart and we need to be safe and the
[15:18.880 --> 15:22.120]  host was like but the borders are wide open I mean the terrorists could hit
[15:22.120 --> 15:25.160]  anywhere none of this is gonna stop anything it's gonna cause a bunch of
[15:25.160 --> 15:30.480]  paranoia no I think it's a good idea that the you could be Al-Qaeda might hold
[15:30.480 --> 15:35.560]  our country by blowing up Walmart they might make a bomb well yeah an asteroid
[15:35.560 --> 15:39.240]  from Pluto might come kill us all tomorrow green aliens might land and
[15:39.240 --> 15:44.160]  eat your brain pal leprechauns might come and put you in the oven tonight I
[15:44.160 --> 15:52.320]  mean it he literally couldn't hardly talk he really thinks there's Al-Qaeda
[15:52.320 --> 15:56.120]  under the desk trying to come up and suck blood out of his feet like a
[15:56.120 --> 16:01.680]  vampire now that was a medieval fable they told children keep your feet under
[16:01.680 --> 16:05.520]  the covers because vampires will come up and drink blood out of your feet in the
[16:05.520 --> 16:10.040]  middle of the night and I mean they might as well told the public that we're
[16:10.040 --> 16:14.800]  putting up telescreens to warn about vampires I mean it's it's as real as
[16:14.800 --> 16:19.320]  that you got a better chance being killed by a terrorist you got a better
[16:19.320 --> 16:23.800]  chance being killed by bees every year over a hundred people down average then
[16:23.800 --> 16:27.200]  you do being killed by terrorists and then every time you research terrorism
[16:27.200 --> 16:33.280]  it's almost all staged and manufactured but the good news is not one comment on
[16:33.280 --> 16:37.320]  the official DHS and you want to see all the other videos DHS has a has a
[16:37.320 --> 16:42.000]  YouTube channel in fact guys will you pull it up so I can show it to people
[16:42.000 --> 16:48.480]  it'll be the page that has the YouTube linked in our article 1984 arrives in

[24:27.720 --> 24:34.240]  started ranting about it the good news is there is almost a 100 percent
[24:34.240 --> 24:42.080]  revulsion and disgust with this and almost no one is going to buy it but
[24:42.080 --> 24:45.920]  see the globalists admit that they're trying to shock us putting their hands
[24:45.920 --> 24:53.320]  down our pants body scanning us making people remove colostomy bags making
[24:53.320 --> 24:58.160]  women remove prosthetic breasts who've had them amputated with mastectomies
[24:58.160 --> 25:03.960]  making people raise their dresses in public they know it's outrageous they're
[25:03.960 --> 25:08.880]  breaking your will and they don't care of it freaks you out it's meant to freak
[25:08.880 --> 25:12.440]  you out the public reason we're told this is being done is because they want to
[25:12.440 --> 25:17.040]  keep us safe but it's about making us not trust each other for the dumb down
[25:17.040 --> 25:23.080]  population but for everybody else it's meant to make us paranoid of government
[25:23.080 --> 25:27.720]  and go whoa we are in a tyranny whoa they do have secret police I better shut
[25:27.720 --> 25:34.600]  up and go along so then we'll be angry about it but expect it to happen that
[25:34.600 --> 25:38.440]  oh now they're citizen spies now there's infraguard now there's clarity response
[25:38.440 --> 25:43.720]  team now there's the Boy Scouts I remember four years ago it started coming
[25:43.720 --> 25:48.000]  out that the Boy Scouts in mainstream news are training for door-to-door gun
[25:48.000 --> 25:52.160]  confiscation the Explorer Scouts and to quote take on disgruntled veterans and
[25:52.160 --> 25:56.240]  they have drills with Homeland Security where they practice literally going in
[25:56.240 --> 26:00.720]  and killing veterans in their homes New York Times writes it with a straight
[26:00.720 --> 26:08.120]  face shows a photo montage how great it is the veterans are cast as evil gun
[26:08.120 --> 26:14.080]  owners who are violent but the 14 year olds they go in and take them out that's
[26:14.080 --> 26:23.280]  being done under the auspices of federal funds through Secure Corps which is a
[26:23.280 --> 26:28.000]  division of AmeriCorps and this was going on under Bush now it's expanding
[26:28.000 --> 26:34.920]  under Obama and so they're getting the young dumb people and also very poor
[26:34.920 --> 26:39.160]  very ignorant blue-collar people who don't can't find any other jobs and
[26:39.160 --> 26:44.440]  they're throwing them in jumpsuits and giving them weapons and so now you're
[26:44.440 --> 26:48.160]  just seeing the emergence of this like oh look at those billboards telling me
[26:48.160 --> 26:52.920]  to watch my neighbors oh they're at public high schools in junior highs in
[26:52.920 --> 26:57.080]  middle schools and colleges it's it's it's in the news we're getting emails

[33:51.120 --> 33:55.080]  land I mean this is so Orwellian in every case it's as if they're using the
[33:55.080 --> 34:00.200]  book as a handbook this is all about setting up citizen spies the TSA being
[34:00.200 --> 34:04.520]  at all bus terminals train stations highways inside schools they've

[34:08.080 --> 34:13.120]  locations at the checkout counter Janet Napolitano giving you messages about
[34:13.120 --> 34:18.440]  spying on other people shopping training us to be spies not to trust each
[34:18.440 --> 34:25.240]  other this is all part of infregard secure cord it's all part of the quote
[34:25.240 --> 34:28.960]  infrastructure protection meanwhile our borders are literally wide open

[34:33.200 --> 34:37.440]  deaths the last two years more deaths than again per year in Vietnam but they
[34:37.440 --> 34:42.800]  don't care that's not the issue they're here training us that basically anyone
[34:42.800 --> 34:45.400]  could be a terrorist and that the government's got to have this
[34:45.400 --> 34:51.000]  surveillance state in place an actual telescreens right out of 1984 on the
[34:51.000 --> 34:55.560]  street corners on the billboards take the Schwarzenegger movie the running man
[34:55.560 --> 35:00.120]  with billboards saying report terrorist a big video billboards in every
[35:00.120 --> 35:06.480]  dystopic book or film this is the hallmark well now in Walmart and we've
[35:06.480 --> 35:12.600]  got falling prices and falling freedom and rising tyranny I mean this is out
[35:12.600 --> 35:20.720]  of control and we have Homeland Security putting up billboard signs handing
[35:20.720 --> 35:25.120]  these out in high schools colleges all over the country these sheets that say
[35:25.120 --> 35:30.600]  if you see something say something as if we're idiots and I was talking to one
[35:30.600 --> 35:34.600]  of the guys in the office who works in sound equipment and one morning was
[35:34.600 --> 35:40.040]  putting boxes in a truck with people and they're white guys can you imagine
[35:40.040 --> 35:43.560]  that I had brown skin and a guy pulls up the pickup truck with one of the
[35:43.560 --> 35:47.320]  bumper stickers that said terrorists hunting license and says where are you
[35:47.320 --> 35:50.240]  going what are you doing what are you loading in there and they said sound
[35:50.240 --> 35:54.280]  equipment he goes I'm just making sure you're not al-qaeda so you've got a
[35:54.280 --> 35:57.560]  better chance of dying from a bee sting over a hundred a year die from that then
[35:57.560 --> 36:02.520]  dying of terrorism but they're saying spy on everybody and now we're gonna have
[36:02.520 --> 36:06.960]  government announcements being pumped through the telescreens at Walmart and
[36:06.960 --> 36:10.360]  other retailers and California's announced they're coming out with digital
[36:10.360 --> 36:15.920]  license plates that have wanted signs on it and and flashes government
[36:15.920 --> 36:20.880]  messages and now the FCC this is out of the hill newspaper pushes to regulate
[36:20.880 --> 36:25.480]  news and they openly say they want to shut down talk radio and alternative
[36:25.480 --> 36:29.080]  media and censor the internet and you're gonna have to get government approval
[36:29.080 --> 36:32.720]  to have a talk show they're just announcing it all America is becoming
[36:32.720 --> 36:39.480]  East Germany we first wrote about this months ago in June Kurt Nemo did FCC
[36:39.480 --> 36:44.320]  stealth plan to censor internet content Kurt's got a new report out FCC to push
[36:44.320 --> 36:49.480]  to Sovietized broadcast media in America I'm gonna play a video clip of one of
[36:49.480 --> 36:53.480]  the top people in the FCC openly saying this I mean they're really going for
[36:53.480 --> 37:00.000]  broke so homeland security wants us to report on the terrorist and and on who's
[37:00.000 --> 37:05.640]  corrupt and they say did you see something suspicious communicate to work
[37:05.640 --> 37:10.400]  again it says did you see something suspicious commuting to work or grabbing
[37:10.400 --> 37:15.560]  some lunch then say something to local authorities to make it right a federal
[37:15.560 --> 37:20.000]  announcement and the TSA showing up on the streets of America groping people
[37:20.000 --> 37:24.480]  it's popping up on local news all over the nation Texas Florida New York
[37:24.480 --> 37:29.760]  Massachusetts California I mean this is a federal takeover of society that
[37:29.760 --> 37:33.240]  recruiting citizen spies you name it and when you look at the mack and
[37:33.240 --> 37:36.440]  homeland security reports that we got more than a year and a half ago from
[37:36.440 --> 37:40.280]  good law enforcement and it was later confirmed by mainstream media Homeland
[37:40.280 --> 37:44.400]  Security admitted they'd done this that the number one focus is gun owners
[37:44.400 --> 37:49.440]  conservatives and returning veterans now if that isn't a creepy authoritarian
[37:49.440 --> 37:54.080]  out-of-control government acting like a bunch of villains I don't know what is
[37:54.080 --> 37:59.960]  so Homeland Security wants you to report where you think terrorism is coming
[37:59.960 --> 38:05.240]  from well we have Operation Northwoods the mainstream you know ABC News has
[38:05.240 --> 38:09.520]  covered it US government plan to stage 9-11 style attacks and we have Gulf of
[38:09.520 --> 38:14.640]  Tonkin admittedly being staged to get us into Vietnam we have Fox News
[38:14.640 --> 38:19.920]  exclusive al Qaeda leader dined at the Pentagon just months after 9-11 and
[38:19.920 --> 38:24.160]  we're all a lucky maybe the first American on the CIA's killer capture list
[38:24.160 --> 38:27.920]  but he was also a lunch guest of military brass of the Pentagon within
[38:27.920 --> 38:32.400]  months of September 11th hanging out with the Secretary of the Army so he
[38:32.400 --> 38:36.240]  was number three in al Qaeda at the time he's number one under bin Laden today he
[38:36.240 --> 38:41.760]  handled the underwear bomber the Fort Hood shooter he he he literally runs
[38:41.760 --> 38:45.080]  these people but then he's always protected and then it turns out he's
[38:45.080 --> 38:49.040]  working with the US government so they can take our rights so shouldn't that be
[38:49.040 --> 38:52.840]  reported to Homeland Security shouldn't all the new NIST videos that have been
[38:52.840 --> 38:56.840]  released that show firemen talking about bombs and other buildings or that show
[38:56.840 --> 39:00.520]  police say and get back they're gonna blow up building seven shouldn't all
[39:00.520 --> 39:04.520]  that be reported to Homeland Security so I'm gonna call this public number

[45:10.720 --> 45:15.000]  leaks we got key intel on that I'm Alex Jones defending the Republic from
[45:15.000 --> 45:23.840]  enemies foreign and domestic mind control alert mind control alert
[45:23.840 --> 45:30.080]  hi I'm Janet Napolitano secretary of the Department of Homeland Security
[45:30.080 --> 45:37.680]  Homeland Security begins with hometown security well it's here 1984 in America
[45:37.680 --> 45:42.480]  this is the straw that breaks the camel's back there is no doubt that we're in deep
[45:42.480 --> 45:47.040]  trouble as a society the head of Homeland Security Big Sis Janet Napolitano
[45:47.040 --> 45:51.840]  has now come out and announced that over 800 Walmart's in the next month are
[45:51.840 --> 45:57.120]  going to install telescreens at the checkout scanner with different federal
[45:57.120 --> 46:03.840]  orders to spy on the other people shopping that's why I'm pleased that
[46:03.840 --> 46:08.840]  Walmart is helping to make our communities more safe and secure if you
[46:08.840 --> 46:13.320]  see something suspicious in the parking lot or in the store say something
[46:13.320 --> 46:17.280]  immediately Homeland Security's putting up billboards all over the country but
[46:17.280 --> 46:20.880]  say if you see something suspicious communicate it okay well I'm gonna
[46:20.880 --> 46:24.400]  communicate something to you Homeland Security I see it suspicious that
[46:24.400 --> 46:27.560]  trillions of dollars have come up missing and the private fellow reserve
[46:27.560 --> 46:30.600]  won't tell Congress where it's gone and it turns out it's foreign banks and
[46:30.600 --> 46:34.440]  corporations I find all the corruption in government that's growing out of
[46:34.440 --> 46:39.280]  control to be suspicious no wonder you want to distract us with all your fables
[46:39.280 --> 46:44.160]  about terrorist buggy men for anybody who studied it history this is completely
[46:44.160 --> 46:50.360]  obvious we are going into hardcore tyranny report suspicious activity to
[46:50.360 --> 46:56.400]  local police or sheriff if you need help ask a Walmart manager for assistance
[46:56.400 --> 47:01.960]  this is Big Brother on steroids and folks this is not a surprise to people
[47:01.960 --> 47:05.480]  that have been reading our sites because Homeland Security for at least two years
[47:05.480 --> 47:09.760]  has been on record starting these Viper teams and and checkpoints in Boston and
[47:09.760 --> 47:14.280]  New York City and Miami it suddenly it's on the local news showing them doing the
[47:14.280 --> 47:18.560]  grope downs grabbing people's genitals patting them down on the streets of
[47:18.560 --> 47:22.360]  America this is wrong on so many fronts it's a violation of the Tenth
[47:22.360 --> 47:27.240]  Amendment Tower Tampa Police and federal governments agencies are teaming up to
[47:27.240 --> 47:31.640]  keep your family safe it's the sort of security we've seen a lot of since
[47:31.640 --> 47:36.040]  9-11 now here at the bus station it's all part of what Homeland Security calls
[47:36.040 --> 47:41.000]  Viper for visible intermodal prevention and response this way us and our
[47:41.000 --> 47:44.920]  partners are ready to move in at a moment's notice folks it doesn't get
[47:44.920 --> 47:48.960]  any more Big Brother 1984 than this but it's not gonna be Big Brother it
[47:48.960 --> 47:55.120]  literally is Big Sis when you're checking out looking down on you telling
[47:55.120 --> 48:00.360]  you to spy on people around you injecting paranoia into the society this
[48:00.360 --> 48:05.320]  is worse than those terror threat levels they had and now the former head of
[48:05.320 --> 48:08.720]  Homeland Security Ridge has gone public saying they would issue those for
[48:08.720 --> 48:13.400]  political purposes a vigorous some might say dramatic discussion ensued
[48:13.400 --> 48:18.000]  Ashcroft strongly urged an increase in the threat level and was supported by
[48:18.000 --> 48:21.960]  Rumsfeld there was absolutely no support for that position within our
[48:21.960 --> 48:27.000]  department that's Homeland Security none I wondered is this about security or
[48:27.000 --> 48:33.920]  politics this is our nation turning into an East German Stasi society and now
[48:33.920 --> 48:37.920]  the system doesn't care I mean wired magazine feds warrantlessly tracking
[48:37.920 --> 48:42.080]  Americans credit cards in real time with no warrants completely illegal they
[48:42.080 --> 48:45.280]  don't care they're announcing it the Wall Street Journal comes out and says
[48:45.280 --> 48:49.400]  is your video game machine watching you and goes on to admit that the new
[48:49.400 --> 48:54.120]  Microsoft Kinect system face scans you and has microphones on board and can
[48:54.120 --> 48:57.680]  identify everybody in your home our culture has been so conditioned to
[48:57.680 --> 49:02.120]  accept big brother that schools in Pennsylvania and other states come right
[49:02.120 --> 49:06.120]  out and say yeah the government issued laptops we give you we're watching you
[49:06.120 --> 49:11.360]  at home when you're in bed make no mistake this is the story of America's
[49:11.360 --> 49:15.040]  enslavement if we will put up with this we will go along with anything and
[49:15.040 --> 49:19.400]  notice this is happening as the economy implodes law enforcement sent my office
[49:19.400 --> 49:23.320]  the Homeland Security and my act reports over a year and a half ago where the
[49:23.320 --> 49:27.160]  government's internal documents admit 90 plus percent of Homeland Security
[49:27.160 --> 49:31.960]  funding is for gun owners conservatives libertarians returning veterans the big
[49:31.960 --> 49:37.640]  secret is this Homeland Security system is for the American people and we had
[49:37.640 --> 49:41.280]  all better come together and defend the Bill of Rights and Constitution or it's
[49:41.280 --> 49:49.440]  over for our society again it is not my opinion that Homeland Security is already
[49:49.440 --> 49:52.560]  on the streets of America and now they've purchased hundreds of high-powered
[49:52.560 --> 49:56.520]  x-ray vans driving around looking through our walls and our cars that's on record
[49:56.520 --> 50:01.360]  in Forbes they've now purchased dozens of these huge 18-wheeler tractor trailers
[50:01.360 --> 50:05.840]  for football games and music events where Homeland Security is gonna make you
[50:05.840 --> 50:13.320]  march through these I mean this is total takeover of society under the future
[50:13.320 --> 50:17.920]  attributes screening technologies or fast program the Department of Homeland
[50:17.920 --> 50:22.280]  Security is developing innovative physiological and behavioral screening
[50:22.280 --> 50:27.680]  technologies to streamline the screening process at security checkpoints the
[50:27.680 --> 50:32.200]  mobility of the fast demonstration laboratory allows security officials to
[50:32.200 --> 50:37.160]  quickly and efficiently establish security boundaries inside the screening

[50:47.000 --> 50:51.840]  America and at the end I talk about the fact that a boycott of Walmart is in
[50:51.840 --> 50:57.000]  order Walmart as I've told you for years is an arm of Homeland Security it is
[50:57.000 --> 51:03.480]  just like Microsoft I mean the it is the governor attention shoppers we stay in

[54:41.960 --> 54:45.360]  for them but you know they can go along with the corruption I'm not going along
[54:45.360 --> 54:50.160]  with it now if they can stick their hands down your pants they're also
[54:50.160 --> 54:53.520]  gonna try to start shutting down free speech because when you look at these
[54:53.520 --> 54:57.040]  Homeland Security videos on YouTube posted by Homeland Security on their
[54:57.040 --> 55:01.040]  channel they're dumb enough to allow comments no one agrees with them
[55:01.040 --> 55:07.440]  everyone I'm talking 99 plus percent sees right through you so you keep
[55:07.440 --> 55:12.000]  playing along that everybody loves Shilchescu everybody loves Stalin
[55:12.000 --> 55:16.920]  everybody loves Hitler no we don't like you we know who you are trucks okay
[55:16.920 --> 55:22.120]  we're done we're done you've already and look the globalists know we're awake
[55:22.120 --> 55:25.000]  so they just are robbing everything right now they're trying to wreck this
[55:25.000 --> 55:30.840]  country as much as they can now back to Julian Assange regardless of what you
[55:30.840 --> 55:35.000]  think of him there's a lot of important stuff showing deception lies
[55:35.000 --> 55:42.080]  corruption spying destabilization in these cables sure they represent the
[55:42.080 --> 55:46.080]  delusional views of the globalist sure people in government are more brain
[55:46.080 --> 55:49.160]  watched than any other group so you're just seeing a reflection of that echo
[55:49.160 --> 55:53.520]  chamber but the fact that it is confirmed that these women especially one
[55:53.520 --> 55:57.360]  of them are directly tied into the CIA we've got an article up by Paul Watson
[55:57.360 --> 56:01.320]  detailing it for mainstream news sources today the fact that we now learn
[56:01.320 --> 56:05.560]  after months of the media implying since August that he's some type of rapist
[56:05.560 --> 56:11.640]  and molester that he had consensual sex with him but they're claiming he didn't
[56:11.640 --> 56:14.960]  use a condom and it turns out one of them is a feminist who writes articles
[56:14.960 --> 56:18.840]  about how to basically set men up and get back at them and that all sex is
[56:18.840 --> 56:22.240]  rape that's taught at almost all universities now and that they take
[56:22.240 --> 56:25.320]  anything wholesome and good between a man and a woman who were married and
[56:25.320 --> 56:31.440]  turned into something bad and that's how sick this culture is to divide us so
[56:31.440 --> 56:36.240]  men and women are isolated from each other so the globalist can corner us
[56:36.240 --> 56:42.160]  now the first judge that got this stuff in August in Europe threw it out and
[56:42.160 --> 56:46.360]  literally laughed and said you had parties for him you had parties for him
[56:46.360 --> 56:52.200]  after the supposed sex and you're saying because he said come on honey I
[56:52.200 --> 56:57.520]  don't want to wear a condom and that that that that that is molestation and
[56:57.520 --> 57:05.120]  rape I mean if that's the case I guess most people were not celibate until
[57:05.120 --> 57:09.720]  they got married I guess most American men and women are rapist of some type I
[57:09.720 --> 57:13.080]  mean if you and you're right to talk about subjects like this but if you
[57:13.080 --> 57:18.680]  never wore a condom at one time you're now a molester okay I mean that's like
[57:18.680 --> 57:22.120]  people who were 18 who have a 17 year old girlfriend and they go to prison for
[57:22.120 --> 57:25.800]  it for statutory rape but then meanwhile Dinecore and Halliburton can be
[57:25.800 --> 57:29.080]  caught running giant child kidnapping rings and they don't get in trouble even
[57:29.080 --> 57:33.800]  there's congressional hearings about it but Assange turned himself into Scotland
[57:33.800 --> 57:40.660]  Yard about eight hours ago he was then officially arrested he's now in his
[57:40.660 --> 57:47.880]  court date right now and they've denied bail Julian Assange has been denied
[57:47.880 --> 57:52.280]  bail judge Dine's WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange bail a British judge jailed
[57:52.280 --> 57:56.600]  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange today ordering the leader of the secret
[57:56.600 --> 58:00.880]  spilling website behind bars as his organization's finances came under
[58:00.880 --> 58:04.800]  increasing pressure so a lot of people I respect are saying this is a George
[58:04.800 --> 58:09.080]  Soros op and there are connections but they're clearly then burning him and he
[58:09.080 --> 58:13.640]  was a useful dupe to them and we've got to stand for him to be released this is
[58:13.640 --> 58:17.920]  all trumped up we have got to get this Lee Harvey Oswald they're trying to
[58:17.920 --> 58:23.280]  frame out of there before they drug him up or whatever they're gonna do I mean
[58:23.280 --> 58:28.840]  this is incredible and Aaron pointed out to me earlier and I have the text of it
[58:28.840 --> 58:32.560]  and the Nixon tapes but we have to cut the profanity out where they tried this
[58:32.560 --> 58:36.160]  with Daniel Ellsberg saying he was a pervert and turned out that wasn't true
[58:36.160 --> 58:45.160]  so some of our guests may be wrong about WikiLeaks thank you for listening to GCN

[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:41.280]  we've got a guest coming on to get into the Federal Reserve the toxic money
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:44.560]  system then later towards the end of the hour I'm going to get into the
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:48.960]  incredible news and the video clips we've got FCC pushes to regulate news
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:53.120]  draws fire and they are they're really doing it they've been lining up their
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:57.760]  people they've got their czars in place they're putting telescreens in Walmart
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.600]  sticking their hands down your pants to fly and training your preachers to spy
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:06.880]  on you and training you know a 14 year old Boy Scouts to take on vets I mean
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:09.840]  that's all in the open of course they're gonna try to shut down the press
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:16.360]  everyone sees through Chalcescu Obama the puppet the neocons the system is
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:21.240]  desperate they stolen us blind now they've got to get away with it so that
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:27.920]  is coming up but finishing up with Julian Assange I I have an open mind on
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:33.120]  this I've had guest on that appraised Assange in the last few years like
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:38.080]  Brigitte Jones daughter year who knows him Assange has sent us many emails and
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:41.640]  agreed to come on many times but they never never said it so I've tried to
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:46.200]  get him on it's got to be more than 50 times Jaren has tried the last year and
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:50.240]  a half to get Assange on many times over and over again he says yeah I'll come on
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:55.880]  next week he never does so we've tried to give you his view but I will tell you
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:59.600]  that a lot of people I respect and a lot of evidence has come out that elements
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:05.160]  of the government release the Pentagon Papers they may have been good elements
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:10.200]  to get us out of Vietnam War because they knew it was a failure and some are
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:14.840]  saying that's what's happening today others are saying Assange is totally
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.320]  George Soros run there are some connections to that but that may be the
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:22.320]  CIA through them to keep their friends close and their enemies even closer
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:27.520]  also he may not know what's happening they may be putting fake you know
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:30.400]  charges of rape on him knowing that now that it's come out that it was
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:33.880]  consensual sex but they're saying is there was no condom that that's now
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:39.240]  abuse that people will see that as asinine see it as persecution and then buy
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:43.640]  into what's in these leaks but the bigger issue is what Dr. Paul Craig
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:47.400]  Roberts pointed out in his editorial published at info wars comm yesterday
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:53.240]  and that is that regardless of all of that look at the immorality and
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:59.040]  corruption that these cables show the spying the lying you know the payoffs
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:04.160]  the all of this stuff that's also going on against the American people and the
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:07.880]  media is acting like that's a great thing and how dare anybody release this
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:12.480]  stuff I mean we do have this national security state operating in secret with
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:16.640]  a license to kill a license to steal of course we're in trouble of course they've
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:21.040]  created 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives of course they got telescreens going in
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:26.320]  Walmart because you allow people to operate in secrecy with unlimited power
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:31.360]  they're going to abuse it and it's been sixty three years since the National
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:37.960]  Security Act of 1947 and in the corruption we had them with the
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:41.840]  Federal Reserve they got government power at that time and now they built a
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:46.120]  world empire out of it and they decided to go ahead and rob the golden goose the
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:50.400]  fluoride head goose that is the American people as we waddle around on our
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:55.520]  little duck feet drunk from all of the entertainment and drugs pumped into our
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:59.960]  food and water supply so they're moving on to China right now so the fact that
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:03.960]  they've denied his bond and are now saying now we're looking at finances see
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:11.000]  they've used this admitted CIA connection with these women this trumped up
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:16.840]  garbage saying you can beat the rap you can't beat the ride and a son showed no
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:20.960]  reaction as judge Howard Riddle denied him bail in an extradition case that
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:24.920]  could see him sent to Sweden to face the allegations of rape molestation and
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:30.120]  unlawful coercion they had a party he had sex with these women for two nights

[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:37.880]  pled and pledged to fight the extradition while a spokesman for his
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:41.440]  organization the US diplomatic secrets would keep on flowing regardless of
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:45.000]  what happened to the group's founder and they say if something happens to him

[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:05.400]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:09.000]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.320]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:17.280]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:21.640]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:26.000]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.720]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:33.840]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:37.840]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:41.640]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:44.360]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:50.360]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:06.160]  the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:10.280]  produced colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:13.520]  of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:18.680]  solutions anywhere in or on the body my name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:22.840]  developer of the silver lungs generator not only does the silver lung system
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:27.040]  produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:30.880]  with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:37.960]  solutions directly to key target areas this includes the eyes ears nose lungs

[01:07:54.160 --> 01:08:01.600]  to answer any questions you may have that's www.silverlungs.com Genesis
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:06.720]  Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:10.520]  there's a war on for your mind
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:21.760]  all right the next 40 minutes or so then I'm getting into the open announcement
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:27.160]  they now have confirmed all of our reverse engineered reports from the
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:32.600]  different pieces we have cast Sunstein the FCC diversities are now the head of
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:36.920]  the FCC and others have said they are going to censor the internet talk radio
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:42.520]  internet radio TV they're very bold we've had the head of one of the key
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:46.280]  committees senator Jay Rockefeller say we'd be better off without the internet
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:51.600]  that he quote wants to shut down Fox News and MSNBC if they can knock off the
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:56.120]  big ones who've been in these political fights and and you know bring this kind
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:04.960]  of East German you know just dry Soviet style news they're going to do it that
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:08.440]  is coming up this is a big issue then we're getting into WikiLeaks and the
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:12.920]  newest developments with Wayne Madsen popping in and then Max Kaiser on silver
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:16.080]  are going above $30 they're trying to drive it down right now but they're not
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:21.560]  successful you watch the graph the last ten years silver and gold are going
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:25.920]  straight up but if you zoom in on the graph month to month week to week it
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:30.320]  might dip a little but it always races back up even more because of dollar
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:35.120]  devaluation globally so Kaiser's popping in the last 15 minutes the show or so
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:42.080]  today to talk about that as well very important information on that front in
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:46.040]  the last year and a half I've gotten a lot of calls saying you've got to read
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:50.640]  they own it all including you by means of toxic currency by Ron McDonald and
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:57.080]  Robert Rowan MD and you know I know a lot about the Federal Reserve I've been
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:59.680]  studying for 17 years and I think I don't need to read another book but I
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:03.640]  finally did and I said well we got to carry this it's easy to understand it
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:07.560]  gets in depth into a lot of things that I was aware of but the general public
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:12.480]  isn't or your friends or family may not be but it's really tied together well
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:19.560]  and so I hope people will get it it's they own it all including you by means
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:25.360]  of toxic currency and it's available at info wars dot com discounted by the way
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:29.160]  and he has the great quote I care not what puppet is placed in the throne of
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:33.480]  England to rule the Empire the man that controls Britain's money supply controls
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:37.600]  the British Empire and I control the money supply that was Baron Nathan
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:42.520]  mayor Rothschild of the Rothschild International Banking Cartel and so to
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:46.280]  break down the book that I hope everybody gets by the way we got 800 a
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:51.760]  Charlotte Isherby's book it's now out of print and we sold out of them in less

[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:20.920]  at the tip of the spear and having a huge effect now no doubt I'll have him
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:24.120]  back up again because I'm a fan of the book I haven't actually finished the
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:28.720]  whole thing but I've read about 80% of it it goes into John D Rockefeller you know
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:33.480]  the whole system but in this abbreviated transmission Ron McDonald break down
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:37.640]  what the book covers and what you've discovered. Well probably the most
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:41.800]  important thing about the book is understanding the real defining of the
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:49.720]  term income and what I've discovered is through a case that I had researched I
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:14:01.400]  noted and the case is three thousand nine hundred seventy six dollars and sixty two cents in currency and one Ford 1964 station wagon in that case this
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:07.680]  property was seized on the land in in the Midwestern state and what happened there
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:12.560]  is that the Internal Revenue Service got involved with that and I looked for the
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:17.240]  authority of how they did that on the land the seizure usually is out at sea
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:22.800]  and this is a quote from the case and it says although presumably for the purpose
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:27.480]  of obtaining jurisdiction action for forfeiture under internal revenue laws
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:32.360]  is commenced as proceeding in admiralty after jurisdiction is obtained
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:37.520]  proceeding takes on character of civil action at the law and at least at such
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:42.400]  stage of proceeding rules of civil procedure control. Well let me stop you
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:46.520]  for a moment Ron because your phone's okay but it's a little low so try to
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:50.520]  speak right in the receiver but I've seen this in cases where the feds are
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:54.200]  taking people's land for literally no reason or an adverse possession they
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:58.760]  will declare admiralty and they will talk about it being maritime jurisdiction
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:04.160]  or literally a quasi private agency engaged in the letter of mark and you
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:07.440]  write your checks out to the private Federal Reserve so that's where you're
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:12.040]  going with this is that we do have this maritime criminal rogue group please
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:17.480]  continue. Oh absolutely and the rules of civil procedure I looked up and actually
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:23.200]  it fell under rule C of the Admiralty rules of court and under that rule it
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:28.600]  says for mere maritime hypothecation but that's a very big now that your level
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.560]  is perfect start over get into what you were reading with the admiralty go ahead
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:36.960]  okay and from the quote from that seizure or forfeiture on the land I quote
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:41.920]  although presumably for the purposes of obtaining jurisdiction action for
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:46.800]  forfeiture under internal revenue laws is commenced as proceeding in admiralty
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:51.280]  after jurisdiction is obtained proceeding takes on character of civil
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:56.000]  action at law and at least at the such stage proceedings rules of civil
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.520]  procedure control why research the rules of civil procedure but it led me to the
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:06.880]  actual rule rule C of the Admiralty rules and under that rule it says for mere
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:12.440]  maritime hypothecation well mere maritime hypothecation is a lien for the
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:17.680]  creditors interest in something this case talked about currency and a board
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:23.160]  station wagon so understanding how they could seize both currency and for a
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:27.520]  station wagon they did it because there were liens on there I'm going to break
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:33.800]  down what actual money is and currency is the gold coin that was once the lawful
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:40.160]  coin of the realm here in America so under the mint act of 1792 in that gold
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:44.840]  coin were an infinite number of qualities inclusive of title rights and
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:49.600]  interest when you use that gold coin to buy something to purchase something the
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:53.760]  title rights and interest transferred from the gold coin into the very thing
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:58.680]  you purchased so now you had title rights and interest in that thing whether
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:03.880]  with a table or a house or whatever however with the Federal Reserve note you
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:07.640]  have a lien in there that's that mere maritime that's why the government holds
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:11.640]  the title to your car everything is basically like rented or through a
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:17.080]  feudal surf system oh absolutely and with that lien in the Federal Reserve note
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:22.040]  it transfers also because that's the quality in nature of currency whether
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:26.440]  it's gold coin or whether it's Federal Reserve note and that lien transfers
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:30.880]  into the very thing so when you buy a table for $10 better reserve note a
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:36.680]  lien of 100% owned by the creditor travels right into that table and we
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:42.200]  understand this to be true because before 1933 in order for the state to
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:47.040]  seize anything from you it had to go through the courts and the courts were
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:51.920]  courts of law today if you leave your car on the side or they arrest you they
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:57.560]  seize it immediately there's no longer are in touch with the common law court
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:04.040]  so we've lost that aspect of our of our society of our liberty in 1933 this
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:07.240]  actually happened and I'm going to disregard everything that happened up
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:12.600]  to 1933 but it started at the commencement of the country but 1933 the
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:19.120]  president of the United States was given complete unlimited control over
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:24.000]  economics in this country that meant he had the right to control every aspect of
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:31.120]  the country's economy and this was because they determined that competition
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:37.000]  was a scourge on society that meant that to build a better mouse trap cheaper
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:42.440]  mousetrap was no longer a good thing for the people they want planned economies
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:46.760]  which vertically integrate old power to the elite's hands absolutely and you
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:49.920]  understand one thing about building a better mousetrap whether it's a better
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:54.200]  car whether it's better whatever is that it actually increases the value of
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:58.840]  money in the in in your pocket the overall wealth of a nation that's why
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:03.040]  then your money in its fiat has value because it's all staked on the credit
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:07.120]  and faith that's the system they moved us to but now they've debased the nation
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:11.200]  itself because they're waging war against any independent wealth oh
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:17.280]  absolutely absolutely so so we were told that to compete against each other to
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:23.120]  build better things to increase the money value in our pocket was a basically
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:28.760]  a evil on our society so the president was given unlimited power and you have
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:32.840]  the question well his office is enumerated with power so where did
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:37.400]  they get this extra power this is the first breach of the not the first but
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:41.240]  it is a breach of the federal constitution because that power had it
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:45.320]  come from the judicial and from the the Congress all right Ron Ron McDonald a

[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:46.360]  mind we unlock is so valuable to the overall fight for liberty you were
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:51.400]  getting up to the president and this this false monetary system please continue
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:57.480]  1933 was a crucial point in the history of America because both the wealth and
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:02.240]  the law of the American people was stolen from them and at that point the
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:06.960]  president became a mini-government the Congress gave the president the
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:11.800]  ability to legislate to determine and enforce the laws of economic control
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:16.680]  and that meant he could for example he could license everyone and that's what
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:20.240]  he did under the National Industry Recovery Act and that's why they set up
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:23.720]  state police that were federally chartered and began the licensing oh
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:28.760]  absolutely absolutely and licensing comes basically after remember the
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:32.600]  aristocrats and you probably saw in a robbery in that you know it's it's
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:36.040]  feudalism you've got to have a lot a license is the authorization to do
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:40.160]  something that's illegal so traveling is illegal in America right and it's even
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:44.120]  more than that it's the aristocrat being able to take your bride before you had
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:49.480]  her that's what a licensure is it's the ability of a because he owned you like
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:55.080]  deer on his property and prima noctua was practice oh absolutely absolutely so
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:59.680]  under that we we lost our law because what happened is administrative law came
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:04.360]  in under the National Industry Recovery Act that meant the thousands of codes
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:09.600]  were adopted throughout the states and that meant you had to conform to these
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:15.000]  codes and the president then had the ability to regulate how many doctors
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.320]  would be licensed a year how many pieces of China would be made how they would be
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:25.520]  made every facet of our society and now the global licensure is the agenda 21
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:30.440]  Oh absolutely absolutely and then also with the stealing of the wealth of the
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:35.880]  American people I'll give you an example in 1933 prior to the fiat currency if you
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:40.280]  bought your your house for ten thousand dollars it had you had the title rights
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:44.280]  and interest in that house but the very next day after the fiat money was
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:49.480]  enacted now you had ten thousand dollars of federal lean on it was a swooping down
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:55.200]  of that valuation they turned wealth into debt with a slide of hand but yes
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:27:01.480]  without one one shot being fired but here's the here's the issue on on the
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:06.320]  income what is the income when you think about it let me ask you with your state
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:11.240]  income tax and your federal income tax I'm going to describe it differently the
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:17.160]  state income tax is a domestic income tax form it's whatever happens within the
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:21.680]  state if that's the true nature of an income tax in the state then what is
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:25.720]  that for the federal jurisdiction I'm going to read one thing the United
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:29.240]  States government is a foreign corporation with respect to the state
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:35.280]  and that's volume 20 corpus juror secunum section 1785 so what is that
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:40.960]  federal income tax it's international income tax form how do you find yourself
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:45.040]  in international law that's the law of the high seas either Admiralty or
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:49.080]  maritime Admiralty being the contract on the high seas and the time of war
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:52.760]  maritime contract on the high seas and a time of peace and that's why they
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:57.320]  always redeclare emergencies every year is to keep that going absolutely well
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:02.400]  here's the bottom line the Federal Reserve is a foreign corporation it is
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:08.160]  the creditor to the United States and in title 12 6 and 411 it says that the
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:12.600]  Federal Reserve note our obligations of the United States that means the United
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:17.240]  States the debtor the Federal Reserve is the creditor now let's put ourself in
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:21.360]  the picture well let's let's go right to the ports of entry every time a
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:26.000]  merchant brings in merchandise into this country there's a duty put on that
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:31.680]  merchandise isn't there and he's working under international law well I just
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:35.840]  described that the Federal Reserve is a foreign corporation it is the credit of
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:40.800]  the United States when you import a Federal Reserve note into your household
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:46.040]  you now become a merchant subject to international law having to pay a duty on
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:52.080]  those products and I heard that once I heard the Federal Reserve call their
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:57.080]  merchandise products now you're importing and exporting every month
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:00.760]  importing the Federal Reserve into your household through your bank account
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:05.180]  negotiating checks would have you and you export them out when you pay your
[01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:10.920]  PG&E water bill and everything else that is the basis of income tax law and if
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:15.840]  you read the Huntress it'll tell you that revenue and I probably should read
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:20.000]  it it says in this country revenue causes have long been the subject of
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.320]  admonitry cognizance that the Congress considered them as civil causes of
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:29.440]  admonitry and maritime jurisdiction and to preclude any doubt that might arise
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:34.360]  carefully added the clause including etc. this is clear proof that Congress
[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:38.920]  considered these words to be used in the sense they before and the point is
[01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:44.320]  that all income tax is revenue revenue is income tax is foreign well that's why
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:47.840]  England calls their tax you have the inland revenue system stay there will

[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:36.480]  that they own you as well and they hide this in plain view that that's why they
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:41.880]  call us human resources that's what the globalists openly say there's too many
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:46.280]  of us we're a negative asset they want to get rid of us so first there's the
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:51.320]  process of takeover and domestication now there is the ongoing wars the
[01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:56.400]  starvation that's in State Department memorandum 200 that they want to reduce
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:00.040]  world population please continue breaking it down all covered in the book
[01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:05.120]  they own it all including you available at info wars.com well definitely in the
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:09.240]  bottom line with using those notes and most of your listeners already know
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:13.440]  this is that there's debtors instruments they do not pay off they
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:18.120]  actually discharge debt from one to another to another they give no title
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:21.720]  rights and interest in anything that you purchase so everything that you have
[01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:26.880]  does not belong to you when you have when your wife gives birth to your child
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:31.320]  you actually pay the hospital with these federal reserve notes that lien
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:36.240]  travels all the way through right onto the baby's head because that is the
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:41.160]  nature of what currency and what money is it is the qualities within these
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:46.600]  instruments that flow through to the very thing that is purchased now going
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:51.480]  back to the jurisdiction considering what jurisdiction we're in most of us
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:54.640]  think that we're in the common law jurisdiction probably not your listeners
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:59.400]  but most Americans do you know if you ask them is that federal reserve note the
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:03.480]  money of the United States they said certainly they don't know that it is not
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:08.800]  domestic currency they have no idea it's foreign currency it would be like if we
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:13.480]  were to import Japanese yen right over here right now and fell our entire
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:17.920]  system with Japanese yen American people would be up in arms but because they
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:22.200]  call it a federal reserve note no one is aware that it's a foreign product not
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:27.080]  owned by the United States not owned by you it's owned by the Federal Reserve and
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:31.880]  I guarantee you if you try and take out 10,000 or more Federal Reserve out of
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:35.680]  this country you've broken the law if you don't declare it or if you pay your
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:41.520]  your your property tax with them over 10,000 there's a red flag that goes up
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:45.000]  or if you put more than 10,000 at a bank there's a red flag that goes up and
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.800]  let's briefly talk about that what's happening here is we think of the dollar
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:54.480]  as the World Reserve currency that's not a greenback a US government issued
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:59.960]  fiat that is a private fellow reserve fiat and so when we hear about the
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:05.080]  dollar crisis worldwide that's a fiat private banker crisis they're using this
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:09.880]  system to control the world as well oh absolutely it's in every country it
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:14.000]  doesn't matter the nature of the currency none of it is backed by a
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.840]  commodity that the people themselves own and that's the one thing that people's
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:23.080]  eyes should be focused on do you actually own that that you're using well
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:27.880]  no you don't and it and again there was there was a quote in the the New
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:31.680]  Testament says nunchal buying or sell without the mark of the beast well you
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:36.320]  have to consider that the market beef is invisible it have to be invisible it
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:41.240]  would be the very nature of money and when you when you examine that that
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:46.720]  prophecy it is a commercial prophecy isn't it buying and selling is commerce
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:50.760]  so you would have to look into that jurisdiction to see where that mark of
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:55.080]  the beast is well here it is it's right out there in the open it is a lien that
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:59.160]  travels all the way around there's not one product not one service in this
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:05.360]  country that isn't now leaned they own it all including you because we exist
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:12.000]  purely by means of this toxic currency so he makes all take it both free both
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:18.200]  the slave great small everyone uses it yeah and it doesn't matter whether you
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:24.280]  believe or don't believe in a religion or not this is a commercial prophecy and
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:30.520]  merely is the law of the as back far reaching as Babylon itself it's the
[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:35.720]  merchant law that's all it is but when you when we go through society there's
[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:40.600]  something that one should be aware of being in common law meant the law of
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:46.080]  the land came and arose from the land itself that's the law of the land is
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:50.680]  common law that's why it's stated like that but when you when you're driving
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:55.560]  down or let's say you go to register a vehicle you'll see it from the DMV you'll
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:38:00.880]  get be given a form and I'll say the vehicle backslash vessel with that
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:06.040]  backflash backflash means equality that means they mean the same thing well
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:10.240]  that should be your first clue that you're the jurisdictions are mixed right
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:15.240]  there the land or the the sea is mixed right on there but are they when you're
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:21.040]  driving down the highway in your car do you not pass islands in the middle of
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:25.760]  the street are there painted islands are there raised islands and what about those
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:30.080]  lanes called shipping lanes do you see the truck going down there with the cargo
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:35.280]  and when that truck goes back and starts delivering its cargo it backs up into a
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:40.040]  tool bay which could be in the middle of a state no water around and unload the
[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:47.160]  cargo onto the dock and what is the the driver do he hands over a bill of
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:50.720]  lading now if you were to find the bill of lading you to look in a law
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:56.480]  dictionary and they'll say for goods on a vessel now did they confuse the
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:01.840]  terminology there if you were to look up ways bill if he had a ways bill it would
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:06.160]  be goods on land to see the nature of where we are let me back up what you're
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:10.800]  saying here because I've read the SPP documents that judicial watch soon and
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:17.120]  God I've studied the inland ports at Kansas City and Dallas Texas and other
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:22.240]  areas they admit that that's what the NAFTA superhighways are our
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:28.360]  international jurisdiction taxation lanes and corridors that they admit is the
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:33.880]  international takeover of our country so this is all actually admit it yeah and
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:38.920]  it's like I said with the merchant law highways were laying shipping lanes on
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:44.520]  the high seas and back in the 50s they changed all roads all boulevards all
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:49.200]  avenues into highways and you have to ask why that they do that because what
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:54.120]  they did was bring bring into the the system the Admiralty maritime or the
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:58.240]  commerce jurisdiction and you we even your commercial your previous
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:03.160]  commercial says we'll ship anywhere ship if you go to the post office after you
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:06.440]  leave this is thank you for your shipping and you may have just mailed the
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:11.400]  litter across to a neighbor for a birthday how are you involved in shipping
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:15.840]  when you're on the land and that's how the feds have the postal laws and this
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:20.240]  is all admitted that's what's incredible when you go to court it's all that Roman
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:25.640]  law you know praying to the court in your pleadings it's it's all there in
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:31.520]  front of everyone the ancient merchant law and then any good lawyer knows this
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:37.760]  and it's supplanting the common law yeah absolutely so we've been separated from
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:42.360]  our common law and the only way a man can defend this through his common law
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:46.720]  that's where he he actually gets his elinable rights and everything else but
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:52.720]  when you put out to see then you have all the the laws all the the immunities all
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:56.520]  the privileges come from the Admiralty and that's where we are right now and
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:00.840]  that's why we're in regulatory law and everything is regulated if it goes
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:05.160]  through society just count the things that you cannot do without permission you
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:09.360]  cannot go through the intersection when it has to stop there without permission
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:12.720]  you can't get into your car unless you have a license you can't build a house
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:16.360]  unless you have permit you can't get married unless you have a license it
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:22.320]  you know it is it is unbelievable how restrained Americans are and they think
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:27.440]  they have a liberty it's not there and now we're entering an intensification in
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:33.040]  this phase where they are really expanding this international private
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:38.720]  corporate jurisdiction with their admirals who Janet Napolitano the
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:44.480]  regional governor the 10 governors over the 10 FEMA regions the government in
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:49.320]  the John Warner Defense Authorization Act admitting there's a takeover you have
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:52.920]  these cities within a city you have London the city of London within London
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:57.600]  who admittedly is its own private corporate sovereign land you have the Vatican
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:01.640]  that's its own private corporate sovereign land and set up the EU you have
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:07.400]  the Washington DC this command base this this district of the Admiralty and
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:11.800]  what's incredible is you read globalist reports that are public they this is
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:16.080]  this is common knowledge to them but you tell the general public this you tell
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:21.080]  a state police officer that they're really a Admiralty agent and an
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:25.840]  enforcer of an offshore bank they can't even understand you but but it's
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:30.560]  absolute fact oh absolutely and you know I'll give you an example here in the
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:34.600]  state of California where I am they have two quotes in the government codes one
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:39.680]  is 6850 I'll quote it says the money of accounts of this state is the dollar the
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:44.360]  cent of the mill they're referring back to the weights of gold or silver that's
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:50.600]  what the money of account of California is but it also says in 6852 it says all
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:56.240]  legal tender note issued by the United States and I emphasize issued by the
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:00.680]  United States shall be received at par and payment for all taxes due this
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:04.920]  state or to any county or municipal corporation of the state
[01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:08.880]  understand it says issued by the United States is the Federal Reserve note
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:14.000]  issued by the United States it's issued to the United States from the Federal
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:19.480]  Reserve there is no law in the state of California and I've researched them all
[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:23.400]  all the codes and statutes that says they have a right to accept better
[01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:27.920]  reserve notes or foreign product into this state see that's a crucial point
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:31.560]  and that's in every state and that's how they expand the Commerce Clause way
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:36.320]  outside its jurisdiction is because when your state starts accepting that private
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:40.240]  product you through contract are consenting to it just like they say
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:43.560]  hey when you try to fly we're allowed to stick our hands down your pants and
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:48.160]  ready at you because you consent it you're absolutely on point that's the
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:53.000]  bottom line when you go and you're hired by an employer you will agree to accept
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:58.720]  better reserve notes $8 an hour $10 an hour whatever it is you've agreed to it
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:02.320]  but and they have the minimum wage law which then allows them to control
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:06.280]  individuals contracting with each other they're taking over every facet of
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:10.320]  society including the family which they admit is their main target oh
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:15.200]  absolutely absolutely and as far as do we own property here it is right here
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:21.160]  in Senate document number 43 Senate resolution 62 page 9 paragraph 2 April
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:27.440]  17th 1933 same year that we went off the gold standard I quote the ultimate
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:31.880]  ownership of all property is in the state individual so-called called
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:36.080]  ownership is only by virtue of government example law amounting to mere
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:39.800]  user and use must be in accordance with the law and
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:45.080]  coordinate to the necessities of the state now the state is not necessarily your
[01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:50.480]  state it's the creditor is the state in this in this and notice and notice when
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:55.920]  you get software you are not the owner you are the user when you buy a car now
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:45:00.560]  you don't buy it they hold as we said earlier you know they hold the title you
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:06.400]  are the user we are literally feudal serfs and slaves all this is is a 21st
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:10.960]  century version of ancient feudalism that was operated the same way in Japan
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:16.920]  Babylon I'll be on which is England it's the same system oh absolutely and
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:22.400]  that's the bottom line and this is what your tax on using the product not on the
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:27.480]  product itself but the use of the product and the bottom line to all this
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:32.600]  is this is an unconscionable contract because ask any American and they
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:37.480]  honestly believe that that is real money of the United States they have no clue
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:42.040]  it is not their money and a contract executed in fraud by either party is
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:46.400]  null and void under every common law a system globally
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:53.480]  again absolutely and at the bottom line of the contract when someone deals to
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:59.160]  you a worthless instrument for your actual labor that is criminal conversion
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:03.840]  isn't it and that's what happened in 1913 they got the Federal Reserve they
[01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:07.320]  got rid of our senators being state-controlled they brought in the
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:12.280]  income tax that was the true coup d'etat the beachhead 33 total
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:17.040]  receivership since then we are under total foreign banking cartel and from
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:21.760]  your research Rothschild Rockefeller Dutch royalty Queen of England ownership
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:26.080]  and their eugenicist and now they just want us off their land they see us as
[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:29.840]  rats that are overbreeding and so they're now poisoning our water supply and
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:34.040]  food gauging if we'll notice as you know half the people on your block get
[01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:38.440]  diabetes or die of cancer yeah absolutely you know that the difference
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:42.800]  between a Federal Reserve note and a gold coin if you put a lawful gold coin
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:47.960]  in a mason jar and held it for 20 years it would still be the same amount it
[01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:52.000]  would not duplicate itself but would not increase but take that Federal Reserve
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:57.200]  note that draws interest every second of every day put it in a mason jar if
[01:46:57.200 --> 01:47:03.640]  it's $20 Federal Reserve note in 10 years it will have double triple to
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:08.960]  whatever because it has a rising debt to it yeah to explain that 5,000 years
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:13.000]  ago a man could buy the finest you know suit of clothes for one gold ounce coin
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:17.760]  you could still buy you know a very nice suit and clothes for that one gold coin
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:24.120]  and again people get confused why do I buy gold okay it was it was 300 bucks
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:30.680]  eight years ago now it's 14 plus 100 but how do I buy things with it at the
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:36.200]  point you unfreeze the gold cash it in for the fiat and and now you've stopped
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:42.440]  the bankers from cheating you out of your savings yeah you know and I can't
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:47.600]  I can't continue without saying how they defined the income tax on the
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:52.960]  first case and was called Bruce Schaber versus Union Pacific Railroad 240 US one
[01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:59.360]  at a 1916 case and the constitutionality of the income tax was pursued and it is
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:03.840]  this case and the government of the United States cites as to the
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:07.800]  constitutionality of the income tax I'm gonna quote what Chief Justice White
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:13.280]  said and I quote the appellate filed his bill to enjoin or command the
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:18.120]  corporation from complying with income tax provision of the tariff act of
[01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:22.920]  October 3rd 1913 most people reading that wouldn't understand what just said
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:27.960]  there but he identified the tax as a tear you know what the tariff is yeah
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:32.280]  it's a foreign corporate government putting a tariff on us I mean this is
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:37.800]  total economic domination I'm gonna have you back up for a full hour to take
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:41.120]  calls in the near future the book is they own it all including you by means of
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:47.480]  toxic currency Ron McDonald and Robert Rowan MD it's you know it's a thick
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:52.520]  book but an easy read it's about 220 pages long it's very well documented
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:56.400]  everybody needs this you think you know it all about the Federal Reserve system
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:49:00.960]  folks I learned a lot from this book and I hope you'll go to info wars.com and

[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:16.920]  using this to remove the actual resources from us this is very predatory
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:20.600]  these people are extremely dangerous as you're now seeing we're coming to the
[01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:26.480]  end of this phase it's only gonna get crazier from here knowledge is power the
[01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:30.400]  people perish for lack of knowledge as Jesus Christ said this book they own it
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:33.800]  all including you available at info wars.com we've got about a minute left
[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:39.640]  for Ron in closing how do we get out of this how do we extricate ourselves well
[01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:43.800]  well first of the first thing the people have to do is look at their states
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:50.200]  as their own home this is your house clean it up if every if all 50 states
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:54.680]  were to start tackling their own states and not worry about the other states we
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:58.960]  would take back this country within a month there's no doubt in my mind we
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:04.040]  have to change the net nature of currency to an honest money system and we can
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:07.400]  do that well if you look at the Homeland Security grid the John War
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:11.400]  Defense Authorization Act all the rest of it it's all designed and stated to
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:14.720]  suppress the states to remove governors I mean because they know our
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:18.880]  legitimate redress is to take the states back and then take the the central
[01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:24.600]  government back yes well there are a lot of remedies to this thing including how
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:30.120]  to get your state to act and we have to be for another show or yeah I'm gonna
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:33.000]  have you back on because I know you've got a really good idea that you've been
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  promoting and well I will get you back either the first of the year or even in

[01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:33.440]  FCC pushed to regulate news draws fire the Hill newspaper and they've got all
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:37.200]  these different FCC board members going on international television national
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:42.080]  television and pitching and if we think there needs to be quality of news that's
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:46.280]  what Jay Rockefeller said a few weeks ago and that's why we want to shut down
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:50.560]  Fox and MSNBC they're partisan you know they're getting people arguing
[01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:54.040]  politically we can't have that and you've got to prove you're serving your
[01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:57.920]  community and then now the FCC announced this week that they will regulate the
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:02.080]  internet even internet talk radio you've got to get a license the government's
[01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:07.320]  going to set up community boards that decide if you get to have a show they're
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:14.680]  panicked they're scared they know that people are becoming wise to them they
[01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:22.120]  know that people are waking up to them there's a new drudge report out here
[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:25.280]  sources editors of Time magazine will name WikiLeaks founder person of the
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:28.840]  year developing we're going to get into WikiLeaks coming up in about 10 minutes
[01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:33.080]  with Wayne Madsen but getting back into this FCC situation here's the Hill
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:35.760]  maybe you'll listen to them when they tell you some of you out there that are
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:39.720]  in denial Republican Joe Barton pushed back on money against a contention by
[01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:43.440]  Democratic FCC commissioner that the government should create new regulations
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:48.800]  to promote diversity in news programming Barton was reacting to a proposal made
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:53.160]  last week by FCC commissioner Michael Cops who is in a speech suggesting that
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:59.680]  broadcasters be subject to new public values test every four years so you have
[01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:03.560]  to have a license from the government to be able to have a website news blog you
[01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:09.680]  name it let's go ahead and play the FCC head on BBC and even the BBC that state
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:14.600]  run propaganda was shocked by what he said here it is in what you call it's
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:19.200]  hour of grave peril that's a pretty serious condemnation it's a pretty
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:23.040]  serious situation that we're in I think American media has a bad case of
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:28.800]  substance abuse right now we are not producing the body of news and information
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:34.040]  that democracy needs to conduct a civic dialogue hit pause using as much news as
[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:40.360]  we I mean listen to the FCC member FCC commissariat like in East Germany or
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:43.400]  Russia where there was a government board that decided if your play could get
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:46.840]  made or if you could get on television and they got all the women in power out
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:52.160]  of it it's pure top-down tyranny that you mean the New York Times you mean Fox
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:56.400]  and CNN that promoted the government's lies about WMD's you mean the mainstream
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:00.760]  media that tells us fluoride is good this is meant to shut down any political
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:04.000]  debate or discussion that isn't establishment government written the
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.320]  government has been paying billions of dollars a year into corporate media to
[01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:12.800]  prop it up to put out propaganda now the alternative media has overthrown them
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:16.480]  and they realize that so they're rushing in to shut us down let's continue
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:22.000]  with a slime bag on American at five years ten years 15 years ago and we
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:26.840]  have to we have to reverse that trend or I think we are gonna be pretty close to
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:31.480]  denying our citizens the essential news and information that they need to have
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:36.200]  in order to make intelligent decisions about the future of their country see
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:40.400]  we need government programming of TV and radio and print to make intelligent
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:44.720]  decisions oh yes yes I mean they just we need
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:49.360]  telescreens in the shopping malls we need checkpoints we need open borders we
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:52.960]  need fluoride in our water we need lithium that's the FCC commissioner
[01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:56.920]  Michael cops trying to police free speech let's go back to this commissar here
[01:57:56.920 --> 01:58:01.400]  he is what you've called for to redress this situation is what you're calling a
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:08.640]  public value test doesn't that raise the specter of overt government control of
[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:12.720]  information I mean people would say to you what one person's public value is
[01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:17.320]  is not another person what we've had in recent years is an aberration where we
[01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:21.360]  have had no oversight of the media for years and years we had some public
[01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:26.840]  interest guidelines part of the Americans didn't know what radio was
[01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:30.360]  90 years ago so the government could come in and take it over before that we
[01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:33.960]  had complete free-for-all free speech that's America scumbag I'm gonna come
[01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:38.240]  back and finish up with the rest of it but you know what earlier I said I'd
[01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:46.360]  tell you the key to WikiLeaks I'll tell you that we come back to this is GCN the
[01:58:46.360 --> 01:58:54.280]  Genesis communications radio network hundreds of nations have fallen to
[01:58:54.280 --> 01:58:59.520]  tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history
[01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:03.760]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we pulling the rug from underneath the
[01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:08.440]  Americans at home I've turned menace influence on our president in Congress
[01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:13.200]  and they really are calling the shots I think it's that incumbent upon all of us
[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:18.040]  as American citizens to pay attention fall of the Republic identifies the
[01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:22.840]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying
[01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:26.800]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner
[01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:30.760]  Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is
[01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:34.840]  saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and

[02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:56.360]  places and Walmart and shopping malls and Mall of America giving us orders then
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:01:00.560]  they're going to successfully convert us to a Nazi Germany type system so the
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:04.760]  choice is now here that's why we got a boycott flying and if you got a fly
[02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:11.560]  boycott the body scanning and the rest of it and we got a boycott Walmart now
[02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:15.320]  we're gonna get into WikiLeaks but it's been said by many others the last few
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:19.880]  days and I agree with them and I've been saying this for months myself this is
[02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:26.560]  the Internet's 9-11 and now the government's saying that we've got to
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:31.600]  pass this law to restrict what's on the web and have web IDs and tax it we've
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:36.080]  got to start shutting down free speech look Julie in a Sange when he's not
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:40.200]  running around have an unprotected sex with women connected to the CIA that's
[02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:44.880]  what he's charged with that's the headline not wearing a condom and the
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:48.960]  women had sex with him again and having parties I mean it's insane this is
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:56.960]  political correctness now they've got him no bail and I smell a rat I know
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:00.480]  Soros is connected to this but why aren't we talking about what's in the
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:05.640]  leaks why aren't we talking about the evidence of corruption it shows again I
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:10.080]  don't know what's going on here but I do know it's being used as a internet free
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:15.440]  speech 9-11 and I've been predicting actually for a year they're going to use
[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:18.480]  WikiLeaks to try to start shutting down freedom on the web and track everything
[02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:22.440]  and they're already setting the grids up to do it making the announcements let's
[02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:28.080]  finish up with the FCC head cops here he is so what you've called for to
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:33.120]  redress this situation is what you're calling a public value test doesn't that
[02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:39.440]  raise the specter of overt government control of information I mean people would
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:43.280]  say to you what one person's public value is is not another person what we've
[02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:48.520]  had in recent years is an aberration boss had no over he doesn't deny it's a
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:52.840]  government taking over and deciding if you can have a blog or a radio show or a
[02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:58.280]  newspaper or a TV channel or a radio station he doesn't deny that he just
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:03:02.320]  says we've had an aberration no the aberration came with the FCC and the
[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:07.680]  fairness doctrine that is pure Soviet tyranny I do believe local news should
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:11.400]  have corporations and sponsors that step up during elections to give a lot of
[02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:14.720]  candidates more attention but I do not believe in the fairness doctrine because
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:18.840]  it's totally unfair like the Patriot Act is totally unpatriotic or the new
[02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:22.400]  freedom initiative to try to force drug half of American children that's public
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:27.840]  news for six years is not new freedom let's finish up with this ghoulish East
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:33.720]  German type fog he makes me want to throw up go back to him side of the media
[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:39.200]  for years and years we had some public interest guidelines that was part of the
[02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:44.840]  quid pro quo between broadcasters and the government for the free use of
[02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:48.520]  airways that belong to us you gotta love that spin all the airways belong to
[02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:53.880]  American people that's why foreign corporations own it and now because the
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:57.760]  bandwidths open and and the bandwidth on radio is unlimited basically and
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:00.960]  internet's unlimited like oh we've got to come in and shut it down it's because
[02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:04.600]  it's unlimited and these arrogant people thought they'd use the web to
[02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:09.800]  control us instead it's backfiring on him so now this ghoul comes out and says
[02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:14.080]  he's going after our free speech cats out of a bag zombie cats out of the bag
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:18.960]  Nosferatu I mean he looks like Nosferatu from the German 1920s film put him
[02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:25.720]  back up play Nosferatu and then return for that free use and the ability to
[02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:30.200]  make a lot of money they agreed to serve the public interest and that public
[02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:34.160]  interest to me right now is crying news and information news and information
[02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:38.560]  news and information by the way when he says news and information all right good
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:44.600]  for you the family is bad wars are good cutting people's pensions is good paying
[02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:48.000]  the bankers all our money is good worshipping the Federal Reserve is
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:53.160]  good being a slave is good government tell us greens to give us their orders
[02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:56.720]  and they want to take the media over have you figured it out we're not

[02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:10.680]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[02:06:10.680 --> 02:06:14.600]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:18.960]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:23.400]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:28.160]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:06:28.160 --> 02:06:31.960]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:35.560]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:39.920]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:09.840]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:16.840]  Max Kaiser coming up in about 25 minutes until the bottom of the hour
[02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:22.840]  journalist researcher former of the NSA Wayne Madsen is going to be joining us coming in about two minutes
[02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:33.840]  but if you look at the Hill newspaper today FCC pushed to regulate news draws fire I just played the head of the FCC the chairman say
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:46.840]  freedom on the internet freedom on radio freedom on freedom in the media is an aberration the government will give you a license and you will not make political distinctions you will not have political views in America
[02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:53.840]  and that's because the big mainline TV and radio they already pay for that with your stimulus money it's state run media
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:09:06.840]  and they'll publicly punish some of them and make a scene out of it as J Rockefeller said I'd shut down Fox and MSNBC if I could we'd be better off without the internet well what they're giving you isn't the free internet
[02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:14.840]  but remember Kurt Nemo we you know we read the proposals months ago this was in June this is three four months ago or more
[02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:29.840]  FCC stealth plan to censor internet content and this week they announced we have jurisdiction over the internet to protect it kind of like Hitler was the guardian of the Reich and Stalin was the guardian of Russian
[02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:41.840]  so the point is this stuff is now out in the open now inner WikiLeaks regardless of what you think about Assange he's a hero he's a bad guy he's a useful idiot he's an evil mastermind
[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:48.840]  no matter what your view is of him he's being used as I said a year ago and six months ago it'll be used to censor the internet
[02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:57.840]  now they've got two bills introduced to basically censor the web make you have web IDs to put you in prison for life if you let any government secret out that's even mild
[02:09:57.840 --> 02:10:10.840]  I would go to prison for the police sending me the myac report where Homeland Security is really for the American people the government's going into a very criminal phase right now because they're collapsing the world economy by design they know it
[02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:20.840]  now Assange has been arrested and I've said I said days ago I said I believe they're going to flush him down the toilet just like Lee Harvey Oswald or just like any other other puppets
[02:10:20.840 --> 02:10:31.840]  I believe that because I can from what I've seen that he really believes he's doing a good job he's being used as the front man there's all these lawyers and people behind the scenes that do have the Soros connections
[02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:43.840]  and now they're holding him on having consensual sex but the woman complained and said don't you want to use a condom and he said no honey let's not and they said okay let's go then they had a party for him the next day
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:11:07.840]  and these women we have the article up on info wars dot com and AP's reporting on it there's also mainline reports from raw story it is confirmed at least one woman worked directly inside a CIA operation against Fidel Castro that she's this wild feminist which Gloria Steinem admitted five years ago that she was CIA Miss magazine was CIA
[02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:22.840]  they don't care about women they want to break families up so everybody has to pay taxes and so the state can raise children it's time for women and men to get together against the globalist but turns out she writes blogs about how to set men up how to get your revenge
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:38.840]  she believes this is taught by most feminist that all sex is is an act of rape so and hey you know liberal Sweden globalist Sweden I mean how is that supposedly liberal they are on record you're saying yeah no I'm protected sex he's going to go to prison
[02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:53.840]  and the brothers say absolutely we're holding him and now they're going after him on money issues and I would imagine his lawyers advising well the fact that's admitted to turn himself in everything will be okay see the first judge laughed this out in Europe but they don't care
[02:11:53.840 --> 02:12:09.840]  so this is very very very very serious Dr. Paul Craig Roberts who I respect wrote an article yesterday for M4 Wars and said look don't make it about Assange why is the media defending all these dishonest tactics by government have we lost our moral compass and I tend to agree with him
[02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:26.840]  now Wayne Madsen I respect Webster Tarpley I respect they turn out to be off right about 90% of the time they say it's all a fraud but I wanted to get him up here to talk about these new developments and to really comment on the full spectrum Wayne Madsen that I just threw out there what's your take
[02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:50.840]  well I think this was bound to happen of course I think the problem with Julian Assange is he had more than his Andy Warhol 15 minutes of fame you know he wanted to be in the media spotlight and now he's paying the price for it and yeah I think it's I think there's Anna Arden this woman who brought the one of the women that brought the charges against him
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:13:19.840]  the word is that she's tied up with Posada Corralis this is his Cuban he's the convicted bomber yeah yeah he's a bomber he bombed a Cubana Airlines Boeing 707 in 1976 it flew from Bridgetown Barbados I was stationed in Barbados the year after that happened and I know that even the movie based on divers there to pick up bodies of children so this is a nasty player and if he's hanging around people like that the loop
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:44.840]  Assange has hung around these kinds of iffy people in the past back during the first Gulf War he was apparently associated with a group called the Chaos Computer Club a bunch of hackers out of Hamburg Germany I sat one meeting at the CIA headquarters on these guys hacking into US Defense Department computers Assange was part of that operation apparently
[02:13:44.840 --> 02:14:06.840]  but most days the Pentagon had no idea what was going on now they've you know now they've got cyber command and they've got cyber security teams and offensive information warfare people I think Assange has been overtaken by events he I think he was used and as you say now we have the predicted
[02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:20.840]  there's some Congress to extend one of them says extend the Patriot Act to the Internet that's right I was scanning over these two new bills and it just is the it's the complete end of the Internet I mean just everything they want
[02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:37.840]  cyber security is already in place now they just want to legalize it they clearly set this guy up I mean he fits the MO of somebody and his lawyers told him go turn themselves in they're the one Soros connected I think he's going to be pretty freaked out when he realizes they're hanging him out to dry
[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:57.840]  he should be released I mean Wayne I mean what probably half the males in America or Europe would be going to jail if I mean I'd say half the men out there are more you know said come on baby I don't want to wear a prophylactic and then she's like okay and then now that's that's called molestation and rape but of course it is that's
[02:14:57.840 --> 02:15:15.840]  what the hardcore CIA feminists teach well I kind of feel sorry for the judge I mean here's a guy you know he had his ODI or fun glasses he had all his different hair and haircuts and now you know now he's a guest of Scotland Yard and now that he's in that system
[02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:32.840]  you know that come out you know and I'm sure the groups are now allowing the Americans to have access to him I wouldn't be surprised if that were the case but I think you know we have to look at the bigger picture like one of these bills in Congress is it has a very really
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:54.840]  big name called the shield wall that's not the kind of shield wall we need to protect German sources this is the shield of US intelligence contacts abroad from being maimed in the press that would essentially shut me down because you know if there's a nasty player in Costa Rica where they're planning to launch another
[02:15:54.840 --> 02:16:13.840]  war against Nicaragua I've named some of these characters in Costa Rica and Honduras's CIA operatives that I would go to jail if this law is signed and I believe that President Obama has every intention of signing such legislation into law
[02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:28.840]  so this is the Internet's 9-11 they've the Israelis admittedly launched the Stuxnet against Iran now we've got to give up our internet because of that the government runs the underwear bomber and we're all a locky I mean they're just staging it right out in the open
[02:16:28.840 --> 02:16:43.840]  Wayne shifting gears briefly what do you think of TSA now all over the streets of America sticking their hands in pants and groping and now telescreens to be in Mall of America 800 Walmart's basically everywhere when they're done with constant government messages
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:59.840]  this is directly out of Stephen King's The Running Man this is directly out of 1984 I mean I mean is Napolitano going to start wearing knee-high jack boots and walking around with a riding crop and maybe have a hot blonde assistant I mean are we going right to
[02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:14.840]  Sattar here? Yeah I don't know what Napolitano does with her girlfriend these days but anyway no you're right I think what we're seeing here we all got stucked in on this open change nonsense
[02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:32.840]  you know Obama was told like that new form of Pepsi Cola they even used a certain logo as Pepsi and now we're stuck for the consequences I think look I'm wrapping up the potential for maybe having to get out of here at some point
[02:17:32.840 --> 02:17:45.840]  wow it's funny you say that I was on 590 a.m. yesterday and I just had to talk to my wife on the phone and you know I've said I'll go down with the ship but at a certain point I mean other countries are horrible that's why I wouldn't leave because it's a global government
[02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:55.840]  but at a certain point I mean if they telescreens and black uniforms I mean we may have to get out of here Wayne I mean this sucker is going down faster than I thought
[02:17:55.840 --> 02:18:08.840]  yeah I know I mean I thought at this point in my life I'd be looking at you know planning for retirement now looking at political exile abroad I mean that's how bad it's got in this country
[02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:19.840]  and you know I've seen it just go down here and it's disgusting and this new congress by the way it's not going to change anything because I understand that
[02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:32.840]  it's all going to be real conservative and and and all right at least like execute anybody that leaks anything and lets arrest anybody that videotapes cops and the Republicans are like yeah get rid of the internet I like it
[02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:37.840]  get rid of free speech that's how we get tough on that fancy pants asonge
[02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:52.840]  you know the freshman republican class has already been taken through the heritage foundation to be given their marching orders so they're going to be caught up in that republican clutching machine and they're not going to whatever they said during the campaign that's not what they're going to do when they're in
[02:18:52.840 --> 02:19:08.840]  just like Obama it's just going to get worse and worse and worse and meanwhile boner excuse me Boehner is trying to block Ron Paul from the committee chairmanship on that banking committee I mean it's just a bunch of it and republicans are like I like Boehner
[02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:22.840]  I mean they're just folks you're going to get hurt real bad for those of you out there that are still giggling and you know picking your nose and everything you better get it through your head this is real bonafide tyranny you got it and tyranny is aimed at the average schmo
[02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:31.840]  they want your property they want your money they're going to take it all I mean Wayne what do you make of the New York Times telling us how great it is that they're going to cut veterans pay
[02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:39.840]  and pensions and make veterans get their own insurance you're a veteran of the Navy I mean I mean I mean how brazen is that
[02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:54.840]  well this is how they're going to stick the veterans into the Obamacare mess that's what I see you know and you know the veterans are going to basically if every veteran applies for the benefits that would break the veterans administrative
[02:19:54.840 --> 02:20:00.840]  stay there let's come back and talk about that get more into WikiLeaks where you see this going this is disgusting

[02:24:20.840 --> 02:24:27.840]  tops at the FCC was the chairman I know it's not he's the commissioner
[02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:33.840]  he is a commissioner whatever one of the heads of the FCC openly saying shut down our free speech I've had enough of it
[02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:35.840]  going back to Wayne Madsen
[02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:39.840]  Wayne in closing other thoughts on WikiLeaks
[02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:43.840]  Drudge is reporting that he's going to be man of the year person of the year
[02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:47.840]  and they're going to really use him I guess is the internet bin Laden
[02:24:47.840 --> 02:24:52.840]  is a face like I guess the West and and and so here we go I mean this is this is horrible
[02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:59.840]  well you know the other thing I find interesting is that we've got a leak of State Department cable would have shown up on a Lebanese
[02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:07.840]  newspaper's website Al Akbar that apparently are not from WikiLeaks but we may have another source which I think tends to take the
[02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:12.840]  attention off of this private first class manning I don't think he was the guy
[02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:19.840]  if we've got another source outside of WikiLeaks back that I as far as I'm concerned I think that exonerates
[02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:24.840]  well there's no way I mean you worked at the NSA and of course in the Naval Data Command as well
[02:25:24.840 --> 02:25:27.840]  you know they don't just have everything in one spot like this
[02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:31.840]  no no and it would trigger all kinds of auditory
[02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:37.840]  that much information was being accessed but then on top of that being copied
[02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:44.840]  okay expanding on that he's talking about this doomsday code that he's got to release the mother load
[02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:47.840]  they'll reportedly dwarf what we've even seen so far
[02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:53.840]  but you said six months ago or more that he would start going after George Soros's enemies
[02:25:53.840 --> 02:25:57.840]  and now sure enough he's going after financial institutions
[02:25:57.840 --> 02:26:04.840]  yeah Bank of America probably maybe a couple other banks the first one is a Swiss bank called Julius Bear
[02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:13.840]  when he went after them their stock plummeted and it became like a hospital takeover by none other than Mr. Soros
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:17.840]  so we've seen him play games with Soros before
[02:26:17.840 --> 02:26:25.840]  you know I think I really think Assange was in this way over his head and now he's found out the hard way
[02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:28.840]  what it's like to deal with these kinds of people
[02:26:28.840 --> 02:26:34.840]  apparently he was co-opted after the work he did with the Chaos Computer Club
[02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:39.840]  and you only know these and you know he's been working with these people ever since
[02:26:39.840 --> 02:26:47.840]  so now he's found out that you know sometimes they don't let the spies come in from the coal they leave him out there to dry
[02:26:47.840 --> 02:26:51.840]  well they always pick a type like him to flush down the toilet
[02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:58.840]  and I mean people that work for this system it's just like Bush admits in all these books and stuff that he ordered torture
[02:26:58.840 --> 02:27:02.840]  but when it all came out about the torture we had the White House memos ordering it
[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:07.840]  saying it's not illegal when the president orders it from John Yoo and Alberta Gonzalez
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:12.840]  they sent a bunch of people to prison that followed orders who were still in prison Wayne
[02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:16.840]  as you know but Bush can hop around admitting he ordered it
[02:27:16.840 --> 02:27:22.840]  I mean that is it's the same thing with Assange people who work for this group need to under...
[02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:25.840]  why do the globalists love to flush their own people down the toilet?
[02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:30.840]  Oh they're useful they're just there's far away items we've seen it time and time again
[02:27:30.840 --> 02:27:36.840]  whether they're a guy like Assange or there's somebody like Manuel Morega or Saddam Hussein
[02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:42.840]  they just you know rolled up like an old bed piece of toilet paper from outside
[02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:44.840]  that's what we've seen it time and time again
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:50.840]  the globalists think of somebody like you or I people that really are legitimately fighting the global corrupt system
[02:27:50.840 --> 02:27:52.840]  I mean what do they think of us?
[02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:56.840]  Well I don't know I guess you know when you go from being an annoyance to being a problem
[02:27:56.840 --> 02:28:02.840]  I guess they have the ante on you so I'm always looking behind me
[02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:07.840]  I look that way before I cross the street
[02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:10.840]  Well I'm seeing America really start to wake up
[02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:14.840]  I talked about the YouTube videos put out the Homeland Security and every comment
[02:28:14.840 --> 02:28:18.840]  I've spent a lot of time reading hundreds of them last night and today
[02:28:18.840 --> 02:28:22.840]  I couldn't find anybody that agreed with telescreens at Walmart
[02:28:22.840 --> 02:28:29.840]  and they were all very thought-provoking and showed a full spectrum understanding of the public
[02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:32.840]  of what's really happening here I mean is that not encouraging?
[02:28:32.840 --> 02:28:40.840]  Well we catch out in the Colorado doing audio messages on DC subway and Metro Bus
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:45.840]  basically said if you see something suspicious the reporter immediately
[02:28:45.840 --> 02:28:47.840]  so we've already had a taste of that here in Washington
[02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:50.840]  So they're turning all of America into one big airport?
[02:28:50.840 --> 02:28:51.840]  Absolutely
[02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:55.840]  But I mean the good news is is that no one's buying it that I've talked to
[02:28:55.840 --> 02:28:59.840]  I hope not I mean you know the question is
[02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:03.840]  when was it the proper time to get out of Nazi Germany?
[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:08.840]  Was it 34, 35, 36, too long? It was too late
[02:29:08.840 --> 02:29:11.840]  So you're really I mean sure you're walking around
[02:29:11.840 --> 02:29:13.840]  there's announcements of watch out for a terrorist
[02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:16.840]  this message is brought to you by Homeland Security
[02:29:16.840 --> 02:29:21.840]  I mean it is super it's like they watched a B movie about a nightmare police state
[02:29:21.840 --> 02:29:23.840]  and are copying it
[02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:29.840]  well it's like Gaddaf got rollerbladed and a few of those other enemies spade all rolled up in the run
[02:29:29.840 --> 02:29:33.840]  It's nuts and it's all because the bankers want to suck everybody dry

[02:32:31.840 --> 02:33:00.840]  Let's talk to the owner of 5star soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say
[02:33:02.840 --> 02:33:07.840]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups
[02:33:07.840 --> 02:33:10.840]  You want answers? Well so does he
[02:33:10.840 --> 02:33:19.840]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:33:19.840 --> 02:33:23.840]  You know, you can cut the benefits and the healthcare of veterans all day
[02:33:23.840 --> 02:33:26.840]  You can pre-social security, you can raise taxes
[02:33:26.840 --> 02:33:31.840]  We're never going to get out of debt because the bankers don't want us to get out of debt until they go to prison
[02:33:31.840 --> 02:33:33.840]  The big mega bank, it's not your local bank
[02:33:33.840 --> 02:33:40.840]  Until we ride off the thousands of trillions of made-up, made-off type scam money
[02:33:40.840 --> 02:33:44.840]  And that's the issue, this is designed to destroy our economy
[02:33:44.840 --> 02:33:52.840]  I want to get into the economy and Obama's little press release and the press conference he's giving right now about tax cuts
[02:33:52.840 --> 02:34:01.840]  That is coming up, but first I wanted to play a short little video that was made three months ago
[02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:07.840]  And you'll notice when the video was made, silver was $22 an ounce, now it's above $30
[02:34:07.840 --> 02:34:14.840]  It'll probably go back down a few dollars, but then surge back even more if you follow the trends, if you follow the graphs
[02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:17.840]  Overall it's going straight up because of dollar devaluation
[02:34:17.840 --> 02:34:25.840]  But I wanted to play this video that I think really illustrates what's happening and what's unfolding
[02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:27.840]  It's called the silver perspective
[02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:34.840]  But remember, the equations they're giving you here in this little three-minute video is dealing with silver at about $22 an ounce
[02:34:34.840 --> 02:34:36.840]  It's already above $30
[02:34:36.840 --> 02:34:48.840]  So here it is
[02:35:07.840 --> 02:35:11.840]  How valuable is one ounce of silver?
[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:17.840]  The mainstream media constantly touts silver's all-time high as being $50 an ounce
[02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:21.840]  Which was reached in 1980 when the Hunt Brothers quartered the silver market
[02:35:21.840 --> 02:35:25.840]  So how much money was $50 in 1980?
[02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:28.840]  Well, a movie ticket cost about $2.50
[02:35:28.840 --> 02:35:31.840]  A first-class stamp cost $0.15
[02:35:31.840 --> 02:35:33.840]  And a gallon of gas was $1.25
[02:35:33.840 --> 02:35:38.840]  While the median household income in the United States was $17,700
[02:35:38.840 --> 02:35:41.840]  So inflation means everything
[02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:45.840]  Accounting for inflation is key when discussing silver
[02:35:45.840 --> 02:35:51.840]  With that perspective, let's go back to the much-discussed $50 all-time high for silver
[02:35:51.840 --> 02:35:59.840]  In today's dollars, the real all-time high for silver when adjusting for inflation is $138 an ounce
[02:35:59.840 --> 02:36:03.840]  This, according to Eric King and esteemed economist John Williams
[02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:07.840]  Just as a movie ticket in 1980 was $2.50
[02:36:07.840 --> 02:36:10.840]  Today, a movie ticket is pushing $10
[02:36:10.840 --> 02:36:17.840]  So too, the inflation-adjusted all-time high in silver is much higher than the oft-reported $50 an ounce
[02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:20.840]  At today's silver price of approximately $21.50
[02:36:20.840 --> 02:36:25.840]  Silver is 57% below its $19.80 high of $50
[02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:35.840]  However, at $21.50 an ounce, silver is 85.5% below its inflation-adjusted all-time high of $138 an ounce
[02:36:35.840 --> 02:36:42.840]  No wonder billionaire investor Jim Rogers often states that silver is still 85% below its high
[02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:47.840]  To keep our perspective on the tremendous opportunities silver currently offers investors
[02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:53.840]  We must remember, in 1980, when silver reached $50 per ounce, there was no derivatives bubble
[02:36:53.840 --> 02:36:56.840]  There was no concern of fiat dollars flooding the world
[02:36:56.840 --> 02:37:00.840]  There was no multi-trillion dollar bailouts of all street banks
[02:37:00.840 --> 02:37:07.840]  And most importantly, there was no proven 100-to-1 paper manipulation of gold and silver markets
[02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:12.840]  Precious metals are financial assets and like currencies and T-bills and T-bonds
[02:37:12.840 --> 02:37:16.840]  They trade in the multiples of 100 times the underlying physical
[02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:20.840]  They trade in the multiples of 100 times the underlying physical
[02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:24.840]  Silver is such an undervalued bargain, it defies belief
[02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:29.840]  Until you come to understand that the banks have suppressed the price with paper shorts and paper silver
[02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:32.840]  Then, it makes perfect sense
[02:37:32.840 --> 02:37:36.840]  At this very moment, we are living through dramatic historical events
[02:37:36.840 --> 02:37:42.840]  Both gold and silver are now breaking the bonds of the manipulation that has long suppressed them
[02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:49.840]  And silver trading in lockstep with gold is returning to its 5,000-year history as a monetary medal
[02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:52.840]  The gains investors have made to date have been stunning
[02:37:52.840 --> 02:37:55.840]  But as the bankers are forced to cover their short positions
[02:37:55.840 --> 02:37:59.840]  And the true value of these precious metals is once again rediscovered
[02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:05.840]  The pricing moves for gold and silver that lie in the years ahead will be talked about for generations
[02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:21.840]  All right, that's the Silver Perspective by SGTBullo7 on YouTube. Excellent videos on that channel. Max Kaiser is coming up in about 3 minutes because silver has risen again
[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:30.840]  And I've had major newspapers, magazines, TV networks calling me saying, so you and Max Kaiser did this
[02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:35.840]  I certainly don't deserve much of the credit. My audience does, to a certain extent
[02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:42.840]  Kaiser jumped on a bandwagon already going by grass-rich people. He pointed that out. He did supercharge it
[02:38:42.840 --> 02:38:48.840]  But I'm not even sure we're having the overall or even a minority effect on silver going up
[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:55.840]  It's the dollar devaluation. It's the Chinese upping their holdings of gold 5-fold according to the Financial Times
[02:38:55.840 --> 02:39:00.840]  They're calling their acceleration of purchasing silver. You know, we hear about Euro down, dollar up
[02:39:00.840 --> 02:39:07.840]  Now today Euro up, dollar down, and it's all the same big global banks. They just run one up, one run down
[02:39:07.840 --> 02:39:13.840]  But overall the currencies are being devalued and commodities are going up. I mean, it's a very simple equation
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:18.840]  Here's market watch. US dollar slips versus Euro as uncertainties ease
[02:39:18.840 --> 02:39:21.840]  And then it'll be the US that goes down, then it'll be the Euro that goes down
[02:39:21.840 --> 02:39:26.840]  Then they'll both go back up a little and then down even more. They're going down incrementally
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:31.840]  Gold and silver going up incrementally. Look at the long-term, ten-year, five-year, one-year graphs
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:36.840]  Not the weekly graphs. Gold's down a few bucks today. Silver, last time I checked it still up
[02:39:36.840 --> 02:39:41.840]  To near record highs, over 30 bucks. But we'll get the latest from Ted Anderson here briefly
[02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:46.840]  Comics gold is higher, hits new record high on solid investor demand
[02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:53.840]  So that's ongoing today where the futures are up, but the gold a few hours ago was down
[02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:57.840]  I got to talk to Ted in a minute. So we've got some of that news here
[02:39:57.840 --> 02:40:06.840]  Also, oil surges above $90 a barrel and they're talking about over $3 an average soon in the country
[02:40:06.840 --> 02:40:13.840]  So that inflation is starting to kick back in and notice oils or gas is $1.50 a gallon, five, six, seven years ago
[02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:17.840]  Goes up to three, you get angry, goes down to two, you feel like you're getting a good deal
[02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:21.840]  Goes to 350, goes back to 250, that's psychological warfare
[02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:26.840]  Then it goes to five bucks, then it goes down to three, then it goes to six bucks, then it goes down to five
[02:40:26.840 --> 02:40:30.840]  And you're incrementally accepting the inflation
[02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:34.840]  Let's briefly go to Ted Anderson and then to Max Kaiser
[02:40:34.840 --> 02:40:39.840]  Ted, give us the latest on gold and silver prices right now and what you're watching in the market
[02:40:39.840 --> 02:40:44.840]  Well, right now, silver had gone up just incredibly today, Alex
[02:40:44.840 --> 02:40:47.840]  I mean, $30.73 at the peak
[02:40:47.840 --> 02:40:48.840]  Wow
[02:40:48.840 --> 02:40:55.840]  I mean, when I seen silver hit $30.10, I was like, whoa, it just broke through $30 like nobody's business
[02:40:55.840 --> 02:40:57.840]  Now we're almost at $31 an ounce
[02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:01.840]  Gold hit a high today too of $1,432.50
[02:41:01.840 --> 02:41:05.840]  A little bit of profit taking later on in the day, but the markets aren't closed yet
[02:41:05.840 --> 02:41:09.840]  But if you want to be getting in on silver or gold, man, I tell you, Alex
[02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:15.840]  At $97 for three of your videos and three silver dollars, that isn't going to last very long
[02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:18.840]  Man, I cannot hold it at that price
[02:41:18.840 --> 02:41:22.840]  That price has got to go up over $100 for that same deal
[02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:26.840]  And I'm holding it because I want people to get your videos
[02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:30.840]  And what an attractive buy now, three silver dollars like that
[02:41:30.840 --> 02:41:34.840]  I mean, you just can't, I don't think you can beat that anywhere
[02:41:34.840 --> 02:41:38.840]  Not at $97, and this is delivered too with your videos
[02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:43.840]  I mean, the other thing that I'm holding back in price, which is also going to increase
[02:41:43.840 --> 02:41:47.840]  And it's just a matter of timing, and I have to go out and buy the darn stuff
[02:41:47.840 --> 02:41:50.840]  Are those walking Liberty Haves at $12.84?
[02:41:50.840 --> 02:41:53.840]  I mean, that is such a great buy
[02:41:53.840 --> 02:41:55.840]  And the other thing that I added to the mix
[02:41:55.840 --> 02:42:03.840]  So we're talking about less than $26 for an ounce of silver when silver is at over $30
[02:42:03.840 --> 02:42:07.840]  So folks cannot find that anywhere else at that price
[02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:12.840]  Yeah, right now at this particular time, that walking Liberty is going to increase in price
[02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:15.840]  So is this the last day because you've been holding it over?
[02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:18.840]  Well, you know, Alex, I want people to get silver, honestly
[02:42:18.840 --> 02:42:21.840]  I mean, that's why I have that video priced down too
[02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:27.840]  We also have what I call the survival pack, which is 1000 dimes
[02:42:27.840 --> 02:42:32.840]  I mean, a dime is a small fraction of silver, and you can use that to spend anywhere you need to
[02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:34.840]  Yeah, these are the pre-what, 66 dimes?
[02:42:34.840 --> 02:42:36.840]  No, pre-1964
[02:42:36.840 --> 02:42:37.840]  Yeah
[02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:41.840]  And that is also just another reason, another buy that is
[02:42:41.840 --> 02:42:43.840]  And how much can you cash one of those in for?
[02:42:43.840 --> 02:42:46.840]  Well, the dimes are worth about 21 cents a piece
[02:42:46.840 --> 02:42:50.840]  So I mean, that gives you an idea of what the value is there
[02:42:50.840 --> 02:42:55.840]  I mean, it's just a great way to be getting involved in the silver market
[02:42:55.840 --> 02:42:57.840]  And you can find them right on your website
[02:42:57.840 --> 02:43:02.840]  Almost out of time, you've got to go to Max Kaiser Ted and Ted, the owner of Genesis and Minus Resources
[02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:04.840]  The best deals out there are going to find
[02:43:04.840 --> 02:43:08.840]  His regular deals are great, but these radio specials, I mean, just do the math
[02:43:08.840 --> 02:43:12.840]  These are absolutely incredible deals, and he's got it there on hand
[02:43:12.840 --> 02:43:16.840]  Almost everybody else has run out weeks ago or has huge premiums
[02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:18.840]  Ted's got great deals on gold and silver
[02:43:18.840 --> 02:43:22.840]  Just ask them for the list of radio specials in gold and silver
[02:43:22.840 --> 02:43:28.840]  800-686-2237-800-686-2237
[02:43:28.840 --> 02:43:31.840]  Give Minus Resources a call today
[02:43:31.840 --> 02:43:33.840]  800-686-237
[02:43:33.840 --> 02:43:35.840]  Ted Anderson, thank you so much for popping in with us
[02:43:35.840 --> 02:43:37.840]  Yeah, thanks a lot for having me up, Alex
[02:43:37.840 --> 02:43:38.840]  You bet, amazing
[02:43:38.840 --> 02:43:42.840]  I wanted to briefly today bring up Max Kaiser
[02:43:42.840 --> 02:43:45.840]  Because Max has really been promoting the fact
[02:43:45.840 --> 02:43:48.840]  Of course, the inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange system
[02:43:48.840 --> 02:43:53.840]  And a journalist with a BBC, an RT, you name it
[02:43:53.840 --> 02:43:55.840]  MaxKaiser.com
[02:43:55.840 --> 02:43:58.840]  Obviously, for those that don't know, I just want to let you in on the fact
[02:43:58.840 --> 02:44:02.840]  He's been flogging the idea of Buy Silver Crash J.P. Morgan
[02:44:02.840 --> 02:44:05.840]  I know he's a big supporter of the Gold Antitrust Committee
[02:44:05.840 --> 02:44:08.840]  But Gata's treasurer put out a little article a few days ago
[02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:10.840]  Saying, look, what Max is doing is positive
[02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:14.840]  It'll show that they're manipulating the silver market down
[02:44:14.840 --> 02:44:18.840]  It'll probably drive it up, but that J.P. Morgan can cover this
[02:44:18.840 --> 02:44:21.840]  So I wanted to get your response to that article
[02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:24.840]  And see if you disagree with them
[02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:26.840]  Yeah, hi, Alex
[02:44:26.840 --> 02:44:28.840]  Yeah, cover it with what?
[02:44:28.840 --> 02:44:30.840]  What are they going to cover that with?
[02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:33.840]  Well, most of the market, they say, is covered in cash
[02:44:33.840 --> 02:44:36.840]  Yeah, that's how they increase the cash supply
[02:44:36.840 --> 02:44:38.840]  To cover their liabilities
[02:44:38.840 --> 02:44:40.840]  What happens to the value of the cash?
[02:44:40.840 --> 02:44:43.840]  Yeah, but we're talking about trillions of cash being pumped out a month
[02:44:43.840 --> 02:44:45.840]  So three and a half billion pumped out
[02:44:45.840 --> 02:44:47.840]  I mean, I'm not poo-pooing what you're saying
[02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:49.840]  I'm just throwing it out there that overall it's positive
[02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:51.840]  I'm talking about three and a half billion
[02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:57.840]  The over-the-counter silver market is, published by the Bank of International Settlement
[02:44:57.840 --> 02:45:02.840]  200 billion is dedicated over-the-counter short silver contract
[02:45:02.840 --> 02:45:05.840]  J.P. Morgan is half of that, that's 100 billion
[02:45:05.840 --> 02:45:09.840]  That's 3.3 billion ounces of silver, they are short
[02:45:09.840 --> 02:45:11.840]  Every dollar silver goes up
[02:45:11.840 --> 02:45:15.840]  What's the three and a half billion then?
[02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:16.840]  What's that?
[02:45:16.840 --> 02:45:19.840]  What's the 3.3 or 3.5 billion?
[02:45:19.840 --> 02:45:21.840]  Every dollar silver goes up
[02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:25.840]  The J.P. Morgan fit with 3.3 billion on their balance sheet
[02:45:25.840 --> 02:45:27.840]  Every dollar for silver
[02:45:27.840 --> 02:45:31.840]  Silver goes up 10 dollars, that's 33 billion to J.P. Morgan
[02:45:31.840 --> 02:45:34.840]  Their whole market caps is 150 billion
[02:45:34.840 --> 02:45:41.840]  So you're saying, and I guess that would mean that GATA article is wrong because they're only looking at 3 billion or so
[02:45:41.840 --> 02:45:42.840]  Please continue
[02:45:42.840 --> 02:45:46.840]  Well, I talked with Chris Powell of GATA about this
[02:45:46.840 --> 02:45:51.840]  And a couple of other people have made a comment that J.P. Morgan would bail out
[02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:53.840]  They bailed out with what? US dollars
[02:45:53.840 --> 02:45:58.840]  If you keep bailing, what's happening to this, to the dollars becoming diluted?
[02:45:58.840 --> 02:46:00.840]  Why are people buying gold and silver?
[02:46:00.840 --> 02:46:02.840]  Because the US keeps bailing out banks
[02:46:02.840 --> 02:46:05.840]  Well, just to be clear, Max, I had you on to promote this
[02:46:05.840 --> 02:46:07.840]  And I think you're a great guy
[02:46:07.840 --> 02:46:08.840]  I'm not saying you're wrong
[02:46:08.840 --> 02:46:10.840]  I'm just injecting debate into this
[02:46:10.840 --> 02:46:11.840]  Please continue
[02:46:11.840 --> 02:46:14.840]  No, I'm just pointing out the obvious
[02:46:14.840 --> 02:46:20.840]  If you cover your short with paper money
[02:46:20.840 --> 02:46:23.840]  The value of that money is debased even more
[02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:27.840]  Well, it certainly exposes that they're suppressing the price of silver
[02:46:27.840 --> 02:46:34.840]  Yeah, why is the price going up? Because everybody around the world is buying gold and silver
[02:46:34.840 --> 02:46:36.840]  In particular, silver
[02:46:36.840 --> 02:46:41.840]  Since I was on your show when we started this Googlebomb three and a half weeks ago
[02:46:41.840 --> 02:46:43.840]  It's up 11%
[02:46:43.840 --> 02:46:46.840]  That's an annualized return of over 100%
[02:46:46.840 --> 02:46:50.840]  It was up earlier today, 13% from when I was on your show
[02:46:50.840 --> 02:46:59.840]  So this idea that you've got GATA, Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee, simultaneously working to expose the short to the silver market
[02:46:59.840 --> 02:47:05.840]  And then kind of hedging themselves a bit saying that, well, we are trying to...
[02:47:05.840 --> 02:47:10.840]  You know, JPMorgan and HSBC are now their subject of an investigation from manipulating the market
[02:47:10.840 --> 02:47:14.840]  As part of a lot of the work from GATA and Ted Butler and all the work that's been done
[02:47:14.840 --> 02:47:20.840]  And now there's an open investigation for manipulating the silver market
[02:47:20.840 --> 02:47:25.840]  And so he, I think, is fearful of a collapsed banking system
[02:47:25.840 --> 02:47:29.840]  He's expressed to me privately that he's afraid that this thing could take off
[02:47:29.840 --> 02:47:31.840]  That banks around the world will collapse
[02:47:31.840 --> 02:47:33.840]  He's fearful of that
[02:47:33.840 --> 02:47:34.840]  And my point is...
[02:47:34.840 --> 02:47:36.840]  Well, the banks are collapsing our society
[02:47:36.840 --> 02:47:39.840]  So you know what? They want to take me down, I'll take them down with me
[02:47:39.840 --> 02:47:42.840]  Well, that's my point. We're going to go down anyway
[02:47:42.840 --> 02:47:46.840]  So Chris Powell at GATA is trying to have his cake and eat it too
[02:47:46.840 --> 02:47:50.840]  He wants to expose the fraudsters, but he doesn't want too much damage to the banking system
[02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:55.840]  My point is that we've got to take down these banking cartels
[02:47:55.840 --> 02:47:58.840]  Because they are holding us hostage
[02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:00.840]  Yeah, we've got to get on the offense
[02:48:00.840 --> 02:48:03.840]  And you know what? Justice be done, may the heavens fall
[02:48:03.840 --> 02:48:06.840]  And people are buying this thing all over the world
[02:48:06.840 --> 02:48:08.840]  As you see, this thing has gone viral
[02:48:08.840 --> 02:48:11.840]  We launched it on your show with the Googlebomb on the 11th of November
[02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:13.840]  The silver is climbing
[02:48:13.840 --> 02:48:16.840]  I'll do a press release with you
[02:48:16.840 --> 02:48:18.840]  The company hasn't released this yet
[02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:22.840]  There's a company in the Pacific Northwest that's going to market
[02:48:22.840 --> 02:48:28.840]  They put it in initial order and for 10,000 pure silver coins
[02:48:28.840 --> 02:48:32.840]  To crash J.P. Morgan by silver that they'll be available
[02:48:32.840 --> 02:48:34.840]  My involvement is zero
[02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:37.840]  I have no consideration at all with the company
[02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:40.840]  I said you have free use of my name and my image
[02:48:40.840 --> 02:48:41.840]  You have free use
[02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:44.840]  If you feel that this is going to help the cause, then so be it
[02:48:44.840 --> 02:48:48.840]  So they're going to launch it until a global silver coin is going to be
[02:48:48.840 --> 02:48:55.840]  Well, you should just tell all the silver coin stampers to go with my silver crash J.P. Morgan
[02:48:55.840 --> 02:48:56.840]  Yeah, I have
[02:48:56.840 --> 02:48:59.840]  I've released my name and image for anyone to go forward with a campaign like this
[02:48:59.840 --> 02:49:05.840]  I just got an email from a group in Poland that's now using this campaign as part of their thing
[02:49:05.840 --> 02:49:08.840]  And I said, look, we've all got to be in this together
[02:49:08.840 --> 02:49:11.840]  And I have no tie to these things at all
[02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:16.840]  Wow, if this is successful, which it looks like it's starting to be, nothing succeeds like success
[02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:22.840]  It's pretty scary that this radio show would be the Cape Carnaveral Launch Pad
[02:49:22.840 --> 02:49:25.840]  To fire Max Kaiser into the heart of the New World Order
[02:49:25.840 --> 02:49:28.840]  Right, and to crash J.P. Morgan, and I want to bring up an interesting point
[02:49:28.840 --> 02:49:34.840]  Actually, Stacy, who's got really good contacts in London where Julian Assange is currently located
[02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:38.840]  She was talking to her contacts over there
[02:49:38.840 --> 02:49:43.840]  She's very close with the people over at the Frontline Club, which is the premier journalist club in London
[02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:46.840]  And they know Julian very well, they know what's going on
[02:49:46.840 --> 02:49:50.840]  She has great contacts, and she was pointing out to me something very, very interesting
[02:49:50.840 --> 02:49:55.840]  You know, basically the bank lynched Julian Assange
[02:49:55.840 --> 02:49:58.840]  When they cut off his Visa card, his Mastercard, his PayPal account
[02:49:58.840 --> 02:50:02.840]  We've seen here the first example of an electronic banking lynching
[02:50:02.840 --> 02:50:04.840]  They lynched him, they pushed him
[02:50:04.840 --> 02:50:06.840]  Now it shows the global control grid
[02:50:06.840 --> 02:50:08.840]  Please continue
[02:50:08.840 --> 02:50:10.840]  Yeah, this is exactly what it does show
[02:50:10.840 --> 02:50:15.840]  That any of these credit card companies, they don't have to go through the rule of law or legal system at all
[02:50:15.840 --> 02:50:17.840]  They just take you off the grid
[02:50:17.840 --> 02:50:21.840]  Mastercard, Visa, PayPal, they simply said, you're no longer on the grid
[02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:25.840]  And this is why today, and this is what the talk in London is today
[02:50:25.840 --> 02:50:27.840]  Today we're seeing relative strength in the dollar
[02:50:27.840 --> 02:50:34.840]  Because today, for the paper cartel, for the plastic pushers, the Visa, the Mastercard, the debt pushers
[02:50:34.840 --> 02:50:38.840]  This was a victory today to put Julian Assange in front of the magic thing
[02:50:38.840 --> 02:50:43.840]  And he's going to jail because a feminist didn't like the fact that he had sex with her afterwards
[02:50:43.840 --> 02:50:45.840]  Because she was jilted
[02:50:45.840 --> 02:50:50.840]  I mean, so now in Europe, you go to jail if a woman has to the central sex with you
[02:50:50.840 --> 02:50:53.840]  And she's a feminist because they consider all sex rape
[02:50:53.840 --> 02:50:57.840]  Boy, I tell you, these are liberals, keep me away from them
[02:50:57.840 --> 02:51:26.840]  Max Kaiser, stay there
[02:51:27.840 --> 02:51:34.840]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government
[02:51:34.840 --> 02:51:40.840]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system
[02:51:40.840 --> 02:51:43.840]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20
[02:51:43.840 --> 02:51:47.840]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else
[02:51:47.840 --> 02:51:49.840]  And I got news for you, you're everyone else

[02:58:50.840 --> 02:58:55.840]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[02:58:55.840 --> 02:58:59.840]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:58:59.840 --> 02:59:05.840]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:59:05.840 --> 02:59:11.840]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:59:11.840 --> 02:59:15.840]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:59:15.840 --> 02:59:20.840]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:59:20.840 --> 02:59:23.840]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:59:23.840 --> 02:59:27.840]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages
[02:59:27.840 --> 02:59:32.840]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[02:59:32.840 --> 02:59:35.840]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science
[02:59:35.840 --> 02:59:37.840]  One of my old sponsors
[02:59:37.840 --> 02:59:42.840]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[02:59:42.840 --> 02:59:46.840]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com

[02:59:51.840 --> 02:59:55.840]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[02:59:55.840 --> 03:00:18.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[03:00:18.840 --> 03:00:25.840]  Okay, we're in overdrive right now with Max Kaiser and yes, the neocons are all out before
[03:00:25.840 --> 03:00:30.840]  It's calling for espionage charges against the media, including the New York Times
[03:00:30.840 --> 03:00:34.840]  Government is putting telescreens in the Walmarts Mall of America
[03:00:34.840 --> 03:00:38.840]  We are literally, it's like they're using 1984 as a playbook
[03:00:38.840 --> 03:00:43.840]  Max Kaiser, your take on the TSA and invading the countryside now
[03:00:43.840 --> 03:00:48.840]  The telescreens that are in London and now the U.S.
[03:00:48.840 --> 03:00:52.840]  And the point you were making about how this is their internet media 9-11
[03:00:52.840 --> 03:00:54.840]  Please continue
[03:00:54.840 --> 03:00:59.840]  Alex, you live in a penal colony called the United States of America
[03:00:59.840 --> 03:01:03.840]  It's a penal colony, the citizens there live in prison, it's a penal colony
[03:01:03.840 --> 03:01:07.840]  I haven't been there in ten years, people say, come on, visit, come back
[03:01:07.840 --> 03:01:10.840]  I say, why would I visit a penal colony? It's like going to Devil's Island
[03:01:10.840 --> 03:01:15.840]  Or some, you know, lockdown prison, that's not my idea of fun
[03:01:15.840 --> 03:01:20.840]  I mean, it's become a joke, people who live outside the America now
[03:01:20.840 --> 03:01:22.840]  Refer to America and laugh out loud
[03:01:22.840 --> 03:01:25.840]  What do you mean, but hold on Max, Max, I mean, let's be fair
[03:01:25.840 --> 03:01:30.840]  You're losing your freedoms in Europe, England, this is a worldwide tyranny
[03:01:30.840 --> 03:01:34.840]  After all, Devil's Island was a French prison outfit
[03:01:34.840 --> 03:01:36.840]  I mean, come on, I mean
[03:01:36.840 --> 03:01:40.840]  Yeah, but I mean, you don't see, you know, this Walmart thing
[03:01:40.840 --> 03:01:44.840]  With people like asking you to tattletail on your shopper
[03:01:44.840 --> 03:01:47.840]  Like, your shopper next to you might be a terrorist
[03:01:47.840 --> 03:01:50.840]  Imagine, imagine, Homeland Security
[03:01:50.840 --> 03:01:53.840]  Information technology companies, the defense contracting companies
[03:01:53.840 --> 03:01:57.840]  They ran out of third world countries to corrupt, they bankrupted the rest of the world
[03:01:57.840 --> 03:02:00.840]  Now they're going to bankrupt America, and that's a big joke is that
[03:02:00.840 --> 03:02:06.840]  Americans stampeding on themselves to go shopping on Black Friday, killing themselves to be a spectacle from network TV
[03:02:06.840 --> 03:02:11.840]  And look, has utter contempt on Americans and treats them like performing stunt pigs
[03:02:11.840 --> 03:02:15.840]  And says, look at these pigs killing themselves for a deal on food and milk
[03:02:15.840 --> 03:02:18.840]  It's not hilarious, it's a joke
[03:02:18.840 --> 03:02:21.840]  It's still living there and not migrating out of there
[03:02:21.840 --> 03:02:24.840]  It's the same thing back in Nazi Germany
[03:02:24.840 --> 03:02:28.840]  Why did the Jews stay behind? They said it couldn't happen to us, it could never happen to us
[03:02:28.840 --> 03:02:32.840]  We were citizens of this country, it's a democracy, they'll never put us in jail
[03:02:32.840 --> 03:02:35.840]  They got burned to death, what do you think is going to happen in America?
[03:02:35.840 --> 03:02:39.840]  It's going to be the final solution, people have no ability to make money
[03:02:39.840 --> 03:02:42.840]  There's no benefit to these people, like Joe Lieberman
[03:02:42.840 --> 03:02:45.840]  He's now investigating the New York Times for espionage, he'll come out and say
[03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:50.840]  I believe in the final solution, I'm Joe Lieberman, we need to incinerate poor Americans today
[03:02:50.840 --> 03:02:55.840]  Or we're going to be overcome by our poverty
[03:02:55.840 --> 03:02:58.840]  That's where they're headed, if you're still there in two years' time
[03:02:58.840 --> 03:03:02.840]  There's a risk you'll be burnt to death in a government-owned oven
[03:03:02.840 --> 03:03:05.840]  Get out, get out now
[03:03:05.840 --> 03:03:11.840]  Well it is true that we have more people in our prisons than dozens of other major nations combined
[03:03:11.840 --> 03:03:14.840]  We have four times what China...
[03:03:14.840 --> 03:03:19.840]  The incarceration rate of America, it's the biggest growth population in America is a prison population
[03:03:19.840 --> 03:03:22.840]  And increasingly that's where they're getting all their cheap labor
[03:03:22.840 --> 03:03:28.840]  It's a prison labor population, who do you think is manufacturing all the license plates and trap keys that they're selling overseas
[03:03:28.840 --> 03:03:31.840]  It's the prisoners that they put in prison with those three-strike-your-out rules
[03:03:31.840 --> 03:03:35.840]  All the private prison operators like Prison Corps of America, all the restaurants and hotels
[03:03:35.840 --> 03:03:37.840]  You go to prison, you end up in a restaurant there
[03:03:37.840 --> 03:03:41.840]  The profit centers are you being prison, that's the most profitable business
[03:03:41.840 --> 03:03:44.840]  Prisons and casinos, you see now that they want to...
[03:03:44.840 --> 03:03:47.840]  This guy ahead of the Democrats wants to legalize gambling
[03:03:47.840 --> 03:03:51.840]  In America, online poker of course, because they want everyone to be...
[03:03:51.840 --> 03:03:56.840]  Yeah, you predicted that, it's hellish
[03:03:56.840 --> 03:03:58.840]  Well you live in there, you gotta get out of there
[03:03:58.840 --> 03:04:04.840]  I don't think there's any nobility in being a guy, the last guy into the incinerator
[03:04:04.840 --> 03:04:06.840]  I don't think there's anything noble about it
[03:04:06.840 --> 03:04:11.840]  I think anyone should get out to protect yourself and your family, go to another country
[03:04:11.840 --> 03:04:15.840]  There's plenty of opportunities elsewhere in the world, and it's not that hard to expatriate
[03:04:15.840 --> 03:04:20.840]  And say to hell with you, I'm not going to participate in your gulag casino nightmare
[03:04:20.840 --> 03:04:22.840]  I'm going to go to some other country, go to Chile
[03:04:22.840 --> 03:04:25.840]  Chile is a fantastic country these days, go to South America, go to Central America
[03:04:25.840 --> 03:04:28.840]  There's plenty of opportunities around the world
[03:04:28.840 --> 03:04:30.840]  The U.S. has become a penal colony
[03:04:30.840 --> 03:04:33.840]  Why would you voluntarily go to a penal colony? Makes no sense
[03:04:33.840 --> 03:04:35.840]  Have you expatriated?
[03:04:35.840 --> 03:04:38.840]  Well, it's in the process
[03:04:38.840 --> 03:04:44.840]  It's very, very difficult to sever ties with the U.S. completely
[03:04:44.840 --> 03:04:47.840]  It's a very long drawn-out process
[03:04:47.840 --> 03:04:50.840]  Yeah, Max will talk to you again very soon
[03:04:50.840 --> 03:04:52.840]  Big success with the silver move there
[03:04:52.840 --> 03:04:54.840]  God bless you, we'll talk to you soon
[03:04:54.840 --> 03:04:56.840]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with retransmission
[03:04:56.840 --> 03:05:00.840]  When I call Homeland Security live on air and report the real terrorists
[03:05:00.840 --> 03:05:18.840]  That's coming up next. Stay with us
