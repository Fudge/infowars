[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:37.080]  Texas Alex Jones well this is going to be a jam-packed special edition on this
[00:37.080 --> 00:42.120]  Thursday transmission it is the I'd of March in the Ides of March it is the
[00:42.120 --> 00:54.000]  15th day of March 2012 and we are going to be live here for the next three hours
[00:54.000 --> 00:59.240]  and when I say we have a jam-packed transmission we certainly do Ed Haslam
[00:59.240 --> 01:06.280]  who is an investigator and author will be joining us in studio it gets into
[01:06.280 --> 01:12.640]  weaponized cancer viruses the JFK assassination and more and he of course
[01:12.640 --> 01:19.040]  has written Dr. Mary's monkey available at infowars.com and he also helped put
[01:19.040 --> 01:25.440]  the book together with a lady who reportedly and has the evidence dated
[01:25.440 --> 01:30.160]  Lee Harvey Oswald me and Lee so we're gonna be talking about both these books
[01:30.160 --> 01:37.240]  in the first hour boys at a heavy news day on top of it and then Jim Mars about
[01:37.240 --> 01:41.720]  10 minutes 15 minutes into the second hour is going to be joining us
[01:41.720 --> 01:46.360]  investigative journalist also in the JFK round but we're not going to get into
[01:46.360 --> 01:50.040]  that with him we're going into current issues and then congressman former
[01:50.040 --> 01:54.680]  congressman former CIA operative Bob Barr is going to give us an update on the
[01:54.680 --> 02:02.080]  TSA the Toilet Safety Administration I never watched South Park because I'm
[02:02.080 --> 02:06.880]  not big on potty humor and stuff but I got up early this morning well not that
[02:06.880 --> 02:14.480]  early I was out late last night and went in and watched it on the South Park
[02:14.480 --> 02:18.120]  website or as much of it as I could my children kept coming in the room so I
[02:18.120 --> 02:23.520]  had to turn it off but they've really hit the nail on the head because in the
[02:23.520 --> 02:30.000]  show somebody a woman falls into the toilet and gets hurt and so well since
[02:30.000 --> 02:36.160]  somebody got hurt she dies she falls into the toilet and suction basically
[02:36.160 --> 02:40.920]  sucks her down the toilet so then they say well one person died we've got to
[02:40.920 --> 02:44.880]  have safety at all toilets so they make you wear seat belts and they've got
[02:44.880 --> 02:49.760]  cameras watching you and it's absurd but that's actually where all this is
[02:49.760 --> 02:55.600]  going the nanny state is a planned takeover the globalists admitted on
[02:55.600 --> 03:00.920]  record meanwhile the TSA's engaged another Psyop TSA says it will stop
[03:00.920 --> 03:04.800]  groping grannies because they got caught lying about pulling we're talking
[03:04.800 --> 03:08.920]  95-year-old women in some cases behind closed doors ripping colostomy bags off
[03:08.920 --> 03:13.240]  of them urology bags trying screaming at them trying to make them walk they're
[03:13.240 --> 03:19.680]  like I'm going to Illinois to die they're like get up I told you get up
[03:19.680 --> 03:27.560]  that's what's happening and so then they lied said we don't strip search
[03:27.560 --> 03:34.480]  anybody I'm not a crook everything's fine now government loves you and of course
[03:34.480 --> 03:37.320]  then they got caught of course doing this kind like two years ago hey they're
[03:37.320 --> 03:40.520]  groping small children they're even taking their pants off taking their
[03:40.520 --> 03:44.160]  diapers off we're not doing that that's repostors oh here's 500 videos of me
[03:44.160 --> 03:48.320]  doing it well we're gonna stop it now then of course they never stop it so the
[03:48.320 --> 03:54.960]  new thing is we're gonna stop groping above 75 it's just you get an even more
[03:54.960 --> 04:00.360]  powerful body scan they actually say that it says double dose of radiation for
[04:00.360 --> 04:07.360]  seniors will allow them to avoid the pat downs and if you ran up in a park and
[04:07.360 --> 04:13.680]  rams a woman and grabbed her sexual organs and said I'm just doing a pat down
[04:13.680 --> 04:18.120]  here you you go to prison for about five years and you should but not in this
[04:18.120 --> 04:23.240]  case not with the toilet safety administration you know why I love it
[04:23.240 --> 04:26.640]  we've posted joke videos about the TSA and they always get them blocked or
[04:26.640 --> 04:29.920]  taken down because they know humor is what's really gonna destroy them and
[04:29.920 --> 04:33.840]  this huge federal power grab and this dog training slave training they're doing
[04:33.840 --> 04:38.840]  and mocking the new world order I think is one of the most important things not
[04:38.840 --> 04:43.200]  being scared of them realizing that yeah they're dangerous yeah they're in
[04:43.200 --> 04:48.360]  control but they're also a bunch of scum and they're just human by the way I've
[04:48.360 --> 04:51.560]  got an amazing story what happened last night I don't even know I'm gonna tell

[07:07.440 --> 07:11.800]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[07:11.800 --> 07:15.200]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[07:15.200 --> 07:19.840]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace
[07:19.840 --> 07:24.480]  elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be
[07:24.480 --> 07:29.280]  healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there

[09:07.720 --> 09:13.440]  latest on the TSA the police state the NDAA the federal courts announcing
[09:13.440 --> 09:18.480]  they'll give you felony charges for protesting just the dissent into
[09:18.480 --> 09:25.280]  tyranny that we are living in here in this once great republic but people are
[09:25.280 --> 09:29.600]  waking up you don't know what you've got until it's gone and the population by
[09:29.600 --> 09:34.320]  and large those that are going to wake up are starting to wake up wow all the
[09:34.320 --> 09:38.120]  news here is just insane there's a lot of telegraph article there's also one of
[09:38.120 --> 09:43.640]  the Associated Press soldiers asked to disarm during Leon Panetta's speech in
[09:43.640 --> 09:50.280]  Afghanistan and this is now happening at yet combat bases in Iraq as well top
[09:50.280 --> 09:56.400]  generals will not speak in front of armed troops they won't even go on base
[09:56.400 --> 10:01.320]  areas around troops when they have guns let me explain this to you the
[10:01.320 --> 10:05.760]  Secretary of Defense will not get around armed soldiers you just heard me say
[10:05.760 --> 10:09.360]  that now what does that tell you about this government this is not our
[10:09.360 --> 10:13.560]  government and what does it say about what they're doing in Afghanistan we're
[10:13.560 --> 10:17.520]  about to get into medical tyranny here but it's on record in wired magazine it's
[10:17.520 --> 10:20.640]  on record a lot of other publications they just report it like they're
[10:20.640 --> 10:25.320]  talking about stock prices or something very dry or what the weather is supposed
[10:25.320 --> 10:29.520]  to be tomorrow oh by the way we're doing mass experiments for you know a decade
[10:29.520 --> 10:34.560]  now in Afghanistan mainly in giving the troops aggression drugs in an amnesics
[10:34.560 --> 10:40.280]  after missions and that's why you had a group of Delta Force remember like five
[10:40.280 --> 10:44.360]  years ago they came back from Afghanistan and four guys in one day went
[10:44.360 --> 10:49.440]  crazy and three of them killed their families the other didn't but then
[10:49.440 --> 10:53.160]  burned his house down and the police pulled up it was in the it was in the
[10:53.160 --> 10:56.920]  local paper that's outside Fort Bragg and said that the Delta Force well this
[10:56.920 --> 11:00.480]  guy was a captain was flopping around on the ground foaming at the mouth that's
[11:00.480 --> 11:05.840]  not PTSD that's mind control going on and you got this guy flipping out as you
[11:05.840 --> 11:09.320]  know over the weekend and going out now where we learn it's 18 people he
[11:09.320 --> 11:13.280]  reportedly killed in just the town going into houses killing family shooting
[11:13.280 --> 11:18.640]  children something's going on there ladies and gentlemen and I've reserved
[11:18.640 --> 11:25.280]  comment on it but but you see this this is not PTSD some things going on they
[11:25.280 --> 11:29.920]  have screwed some of these soldiers up so bad with the drugs they're giving them
[11:29.920 --> 11:34.800]  in things and this is admitted but details are classified again oh we're
[11:34.800 --> 11:39.080]  testing amnesics and we're testing aggression drugs on them in fact I've
[11:39.080 --> 11:44.440]  seen reports that out of a brigade of say 4,000 people in the army over there as
[11:44.440 --> 11:50.080]  many as 500 are being tested on and I need to open the phones up sometime in
[11:50.080 --> 11:53.600]  the next week or so we don't have a bunch of guests lined up just to have
[11:53.600 --> 11:56.600]  military calling about this and I need to go back and pull all the articles on
[11:56.600 --> 12:00.320]  this and report on it because it's again it's being reported on but it's just
[12:00.320 --> 12:06.280]  like oh yeah we're doing some testing on their minds what's mind control so now
[12:06.280 --> 12:10.120]  soldiers were asked to disarm during a speech by Leon Panetta the American
[12:10.120 --> 12:16.160]  Defense Secretary in a sign of growing concern over spats just spats you know
[12:16.160 --> 12:20.080]  mass killing of seemingly random violence yeah they're just killing
[12:20.080 --> 12:24.840]  officers are killing people trips are killing other trips worse than Vietnam
[12:24.840 --> 12:28.200]  ever was and then the people are saying well I don't know why I did it it's not
[12:28.200 --> 12:32.000]  like I got mad at the sergeant because he's been you know doing so I threw a
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.880]  hang grenade in there no no we're not talking about just fragging you know that's
[12:35.880 --> 12:42.080]  going on in every army forever this is just I don't know why I started killing
[12:42.080 --> 12:45.640]  people I don't know why I went to barracks and started shooting people I
[12:45.640 --> 12:49.800]  don't remember so we're gonna be talking about that and speaking of mind
[12:49.800 --> 12:53.040]  control and we're gonna go to our guests and I'll intersperse we got so many
[12:53.040 --> 12:58.440]  guests today news throughout the transmission big pharma pushes drug to
[12:58.440 --> 13:01.960]  cure racism now remember I we had the report Monday where they're saying
[13:01.960 --> 13:06.280]  that they're going to start well they admit they want to put drugs in the
[13:06.280 --> 13:12.200]  water to make us not be aggressive and submit but also to make a smaller they're
[13:12.200 --> 13:16.000]  now saying the big bioethicist grips and and they're publishing it and of
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.920]  course they say kill babies up to age three and but seeing that suddenly they
[13:19.920 --> 13:23.600]  know that we're aware of them they're just trying to acclimate us to make it
[13:23.600 --> 13:29.120]  as insane as possible but it's all over the news that oh we're gonna start
[13:29.120 --> 13:34.720]  giving you a heart drug so you're not racist whatever that means cuz some
[13:34.720 --> 13:38.000]  psychiatrists say so and they want to put lithium in the water too but
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.640]  everything's okay yeah they're drugging the troops but I could tell you exactly
[13:40.640 --> 13:45.560]  what but just they don't let the brass get around them though that nothing's
[13:45.560 --> 13:50.160]  going on though everything's fine just a precaution and yeah they're announcing
[13:50.160 --> 13:53.760]  they're gonna secretly arrest citizens whenever they want but again everything's
[13:53.760 --> 13:57.200]  they but they're oh they're now trying to say vaccines are the law to take you
[13:57.200 --> 14:00.880]  know there's no law I've got a journal pediatrics is recommending forced
[14:00.880 --> 14:06.440]  Gardasil for boys as well so they don't get to cervical cancer did you catch
[14:06.440 --> 14:12.480]  that again big pharma pushes drug to cure racism and they're saying it's I
[14:12.480 --> 14:15.400]  can say this until I get on the air it's one of the few things I get stage
[14:15.400 --> 14:18.640]  fright with is weird drug names on there that I'm gonna mess them up pro
[14:18.640 --> 14:25.760]  pranolol and it's in the Journal of Psychopharmacology and they're just
[14:25.760 --> 14:29.120]  saying generally we need to start drugging the public now the reason I
[14:29.120 --> 14:37.720]  find our guest research so amazing is because he he just stumbled into into
[14:37.720 --> 14:40.400]  the truth and didn't brush himself off and just walk off in the distance
[14:40.400 --> 14:44.320]  ignore it because I guess his dad had worked around this lady he had a you
[14:44.320 --> 14:48.160]  know connection to her and he began to research and he fell down the rabbit hole
[14:48.160 --> 14:53.760]  and the book is Dr. Mary's monkey how the unsolved murder of a doctor a secret
[14:53.760 --> 14:57.200]  laboratory in New Orleans and the cancer-causing monkey virus are linked to
[14:57.200 --> 15:01.320]  Lee Harvey Oswald the JFK assassination emerging global epidemics and his
[15:01.320 --> 15:04.680]  research again just proves on top of all the other proof that a Lee Harvey
[15:04.680 --> 15:08.480]  Oswald was a government asset that there was weaponized cancer programs going on
[15:08.480 --> 15:13.720]  even you know the film JFK has some of that it based on Jim Mars work he's
[15:13.720 --> 15:18.320]  joining us next hour and you know he's got all these documents wants to go
[15:18.320 --> 15:21.480]  over and then that's great when we 92% of people in the average pull another
[15:21.480 --> 15:24.240]  government killed Kennedy and there's a whole shadow government and what you're
[15:24.240 --> 15:28.320]  proud of for me it's that his research dovetails with all the confirmed info
[15:28.320 --> 15:32.520]  or hundreds of millions of people then exposed to cancer viruses and tens of
[15:32.520 --> 15:37.200]  millions of died conservatively I mean this is the biggest story ever and he
[15:37.200 --> 15:42.240]  has you know a juncture right into original source documents government
[15:42.240 --> 15:46.560]  documents research in Dr. Mary's monkeys and it's a page turn I mean it's
[15:46.560 --> 15:51.120]  reality and it's frightening but but also it's it's a who-done-it I mean it's
[15:51.120 --> 15:55.920]  a masterpiece book and we do sell it at info wars.com and it dovetails with me
[15:55.920 --> 16:02.640]  and Lee how I came to know love and lose Lee Harvey Oswald and we're gonna talk
[16:02.640 --> 16:06.200]  some about this book that he helped put together with the lady who on got the
[16:06.200 --> 16:10.680]  proof you know was dating the government operative Lee Harvey Oswald but
[16:10.680 --> 16:14.120]  Edward T. Haslam thank you so much of course the forward to your books written
[16:14.120 --> 16:17.440]  by Jim Mars I should add is here we're going to break it about four minutes but
[16:17.440 --> 16:22.600]  you've got the floor pretty much for the hour I mean tell us about your journey
[16:22.600 --> 16:25.920]  how you found the rabbit hole I think something this big that's a good place
[16:25.920 --> 16:30.960]  to start so let's start at the beginning. Well Mary Sherman was a colleague of my
[16:30.960 --> 16:35.560]  father's and they were both professors of orthopedic surgery at Tully Medical
[16:35.560 --> 16:41.020]  School in New Orleans I even sat on her lap once as a child and so when she was
[16:41.020 --> 16:45.120]  murdered it was kind of big news in our family because she was like my father's
[16:45.120 --> 16:50.800]  best friend and because of that I knew things about Mary Sherman and her
[16:50.800 --> 16:55.680]  murder that the public didn't know and I was very suspicious for a very long time
[16:55.680 --> 17:00.560]  my father who came out of Harvard Medical School had like the utmost of
[17:00.560 --> 17:04.680]  respect for this woman who's out of the University of Chicago turns out that she
[17:04.680 --> 17:09.240]  was good friends with Enrico Fermi she was bringing radiation into medicine and
[17:09.240 --> 17:15.300]  she was published in cancer articles even University of Texas published a book
[17:15.300 --> 17:20.640]  called tumors of the bone and soft tissue that had several articles by her in
[17:20.640 --> 17:25.200]  there in which she challenged the very language that was used to describe cancer
[17:25.200 --> 17:30.240]  okay so she was a high-level hitter and that's the first part I knew and the
[17:30.240 --> 17:35.560]  other part I knew was that her arm was missing and it wasn't until I got my
[17:35.560 --> 17:38.960]  the documents and there's a lot of people have had bad information about this
[17:38.960 --> 17:43.920]  but I went and got the police reports and the autopsy reports and the homicide
[17:43.920 --> 17:49.240]  report all from the public library and I got all of the newspaper articles about
[17:49.240 --> 17:54.680]  two weeks of coverage and I laid them out on my table and I noticed that this
[17:54.680 --> 17:59.640]  fact that was very clear in the police reports and in the autopsy which was that
[17:59.640 --> 18:05.600]  Mary Sherman's entire right arm and rib cage had been disintegrated by heat and
[18:05.600 --> 18:08.280]  even the cops on the scene said they could stand there and see the internal
[18:08.280 --> 18:14.640]  organs of her body okay this was never not in a single newspaper ad I mean
[18:14.640 --> 18:19.800]  newspaper story okay so why was it that they didn't tell the public about this
[18:19.800 --> 18:24.080]  and as you get into it you realize that there's nothing in her apartment that
[18:24.080 --> 18:28.680]  could have possibly burned off her arm and right next to that is unburned
[18:28.680 --> 18:35.040]  human hair so how do you get thousands and thousands of degrees to disintegrate
[18:35.040 --> 18:38.360]  they come to somebody's house nothing's on fire and a person's got a cauterized
[18:38.360 --> 18:41.960]  like they've been shot by you know stormtroopers you're wondering what's
[18:41.960 --> 18:45.880]  going on here right and there's nothing in it so that you have to be left with
[18:45.880 --> 18:49.920]  the conclusion that they brought her body back to her apartment after an
[18:49.920 --> 18:55.760]  incident somewhere else and faked this murder scene and they didn't want people
[18:55.760 --> 18:59.040]  running around uptown New Orleans looking for the machine that burned off her
[18:59.040 --> 19:04.600]  arm and it turns out they were firing radiation into different viruses and
[19:04.600 --> 19:09.640]  other things and trying to create well tell folks what what she was working on
[19:09.640 --> 19:12.840]  we're about to go to break but tell folks well what happened with polio
[19:12.840 --> 19:16.680]  vaccine is after they released a hundred million doses of it they realized
[19:16.680 --> 19:21.760]  there was a cancer-causing virus in it so they decided at that point to make it
[19:21.760 --> 19:26.480]  secret and to get busy looking for a anti-cancer vaccine and they were in a
[19:26.480 --> 19:31.360]  hurry so they started using radiation to mutate the cancer-causing monkey virus
[19:31.360 --> 19:35.280]  to try to create a vex at least that's what they told the researchers well this
[19:35.280 --> 19:40.040]  is what was happening in 6061 it changes and gets much darker after the
[19:40.040 --> 19:46.120]  Cuban Missile Crisis in 62 by 63 they are deliberately making a biological
[19:46.120 --> 19:51.400]  weapon with this aggressive cancer stay there amazing the book is Dr. Mary's
[19:51.400 --> 19:56.440]  monkey Edward T. Haslam hope you enjoy the government killing most of you out
[19:56.440 --> 20:01.240]  there they're nice people though they want to keep us safe I've seen the

[20:04.840 --> 20:08.840]  using them had a little bit of results but I wasn't following the regimen every

[24:24.120 --> 24:31.480]  search engine cancer viruses in vaccines it's not just the polio vaccines we
[24:31.480 --> 24:36.760]  find this across the board and I know it's not as scary as men with turbines
[24:36.760 --> 24:39.520]  and beards that you have a better chance of dying from a honey bee sting I
[24:39.520 --> 24:43.480]  understand it's fun to get scared of them and beg for the TSA to give you a
[24:43.480 --> 24:50.160]  public proctology exam but the real threat is this medical mafia that knows
[24:50.160 --> 24:52.960]  you're waking up so that's why they're announcing oh we're just gonna drug
[24:52.960 --> 24:58.640]  your water it's Fox News you name it just we're gonna put lithium in there see
[24:58.640 --> 25:02.440]  it's all out in the open now but the public needs to understand and I'm not
[25:02.440 --> 25:08.440]  kidding I've done the research from every angle on this a large portion of
[25:08.440 --> 25:13.240]  those the evidence shows the majority of people that have died of cancer in the
[25:13.240 --> 25:19.000]  last 50 years or so you can direct right back to the polio vaccine the rest of it
[25:19.000 --> 25:26.360]  and this is the silent slow painful holocaust that we're going through and
[25:26.360 --> 25:29.200]  please continue this is short segment long segment coming up we're gonna keep
[25:29.200 --> 25:33.160]  you 20 minutes the next hour with Jim Mars to cross over on this subject but
[25:33.160 --> 25:37.120]  please continue getting into the rabbit hole well I want to just make a
[25:37.120 --> 25:42.320]  comment on this terrorism thing you just brought up because on September 11
[25:42.320 --> 25:47.320]  2001 we lost about three and a half thousand people due to terrorism that
[25:47.320 --> 25:51.480]  same day we lost about three and a half thousand people due to cancer the next
[25:51.480 --> 25:56.520]  day we lost three and a half thousand people due to cancer we have lost 12
[25:56.520 --> 26:04.960]  and a half million people due to cancer since September 11th and where's the
[26:04.960 --> 26:11.040]  where's the fear I mean it's why is it skyrocketing we need that oh but it's
[26:11.040 --> 26:16.280]  always find a cure not find out why it's happening right and there's and I mean
[26:16.280 --> 26:20.680]  just ask anybody you know do you have anybody in your family or friend circle
[26:20.680 --> 26:27.760]  with cancer yes they do I mean this is a epidemic that's about 15 or 20 times the
[26:27.760 --> 26:33.200]  size of the polio epidemic but they never refer to it as a cancer epidemic I
[26:33.200 --> 26:37.040]  mean this is straight out of Orwell's on Newspeak you know they're
[26:37.040 --> 26:41.480]  manipulating oh now they're gonna and they make like a party like oh the kid a
[26:41.480 --> 26:44.920]  lot of kids at school have it you're part of the cancer group now and they
[26:44.920 --> 26:49.280]  never discuss why is it skyrocketing again it's it's I mean if people were
[26:49.280 --> 26:53.600]  suddenly dying of arsenic poisoning or cyanide poisoning they wouldn't say
[26:53.600 --> 26:57.440]  let's find a way to cure something so you don't die when you eat you know a
[26:57.440 --> 27:01.120]  deadly poison you'd say why are people getting this poisoning so I started
[27:01.120 --> 27:05.560]  researching Dr. Mary Sherman and her background okay and I discovered that
[27:05.560 --> 27:09.680]  she had gone to the University of Chicago Medical School as a first-year
[27:09.680 --> 27:14.280]  medical student with a woman named Sarah Stewart and it was Sarah Stewart who
[27:14.280 --> 27:19.400]  was the MD PhD researcher at the National Cancer Institute who discovered
[27:19.400 --> 27:23.720]  the cancer-causing virus and her research partner up there was Bernice
[27:23.720 --> 27:28.440]  Eddy and it was Bernice Eddy that discovered that it was in the polio
[27:28.440 --> 27:32.640]  vaccine and why was it in the polio vaccine because they grew the polio
[27:32.640 --> 27:38.360]  vaccine on monkey kidney cells and these are cancer-causing monkey viruses and
[27:38.360 --> 27:42.160]  they were taken monkeys from Asia and monkeys from Africa and putting them in
[27:42.160 --> 27:48.340]  the same cage and they were getting cross-infected with each other's viruses
[27:48.340 --> 27:54.520]  mutating yeah and when they took the polio virus out to make the vaccine they
[27:54.520 --> 27:59.200]  got all the other viruses and there were dozens of them in there and I've got
[27:59.200 --> 28:03.880]  that on page one of the National Cancer Institute newsletter I mean this is not
[28:03.880 --> 28:07.720]  a theory this is what happened and you've got it all in your book you've got
[28:07.720 --> 28:12.140]  government documents all of it it's just wow well when I saw that I had
[28:12.140 --> 28:17.040]  to ask a question I said if this woman is telling us there is going to be an
[28:17.040 --> 28:21.520]  epidemic of cancer and that's what Bernice Eddy said in 1916 when she got
[28:21.520 --> 28:26.240]  into so much trouble for saying it okay I said she's trying to warn us did this
[28:26.240 --> 28:30.520]  epidemic ever show up so I went to the medical library and I got the NCI
[28:30.520 --> 28:35.520]  statistics for Nixon's war on cancer which was about a 16-year-old window
[28:35.520 --> 28:40.520]  and you see these four soft tissue cancers breast prostate melanoma and
[28:40.520 --> 28:44.520]  lymphoma erupt out of the whenever they have a war on something there's gonna be
[28:44.520 --> 28:47.960]  more of it they have a war on drugs they're shipping it in they're gonna
[28:47.960 --> 28:51.000]  have a war on cancer look out you're gonna be getting in well what I find
[28:51.000 --> 28:56.320]  interesting is that Nixon declared this war on cancer in his first week in the
[28:56.320 --> 29:00.520]  White House that implies a certain amount of premeditation for this and then
[29:00.520 --> 29:05.760]  you go back and realize that Nixon was VP during the release of the polio
[29:05.760 --> 29:10.960]  vaccine and Dwight's running the Cold War and Nixon's running the domestic
[29:10.960 --> 29:16.920]  stuff so Nixon's holding the roses on the polio vaccine and he knows it's
[29:16.920 --> 29:21.560]  contaminated now this is like the skeleton in the national closet this is
[29:21.560 --> 29:24.960]  the biggest this is the big kahuna the biggest mistake in the history of
[29:24.960 --> 29:28.960]  government of worldwide until you read the Rockefeller documents where they
[29:28.960 --> 29:35.840]  want to reduce our population I said mistake well stay there I want to come
[29:35.840 --> 29:39.040]  back and discuss that because you know that's what they tell the researchers
[29:39.040 --> 29:42.640]  that's what they tell the president that's the compartmentalization but no
[29:42.640 --> 29:45.880]  doubt it's going on and they've covered it up regardless it's going on we'll be
[29:45.880 --> 29:50.320]  back it's all in the book Dr. Mary's monkey and in full wars.com we're on
[29:50.320 --> 30:00.720]  the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this is
[30:00.720 --> 30:04.080]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[30:04.080 --> 30:08.040]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[30:08.040 --> 30:12.280]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[30:12.280 --> 30:16.560]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[30:16.560 --> 30:20.920]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[30:20.920 --> 30:25.000]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[30:25.000 --> 30:29.560]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[30:29.560 --> 30:33.680]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[30:33.680 --> 30:37.680]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[30:37.680 --> 30:41.480]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[30:41.480 --> 30:44.200]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[30:44.200 --> 30:49.160]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at WWW dot my
[30:49.160 --> 30:53.280]  solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the government

[34:23.200 --> 34:27.840]  via podcasts and audio streams that shows that people are hungry for the
[34:27.840 --> 34:33.160]  truth even if it's delivered by little old me people put up with me when I
[34:33.160 --> 34:37.840]  appreciate that again God bless you all for joining us here I understand that
[34:37.840 --> 34:44.560]  Jay-Z is pretty entertaining that that you know people are obsessing over
[34:44.560 --> 34:49.280]  basketball games right now I understand that it's spring break nice
[34:49.280 --> 34:53.440]  weather in many parts of the country but we are on a planet hurtling through space
[34:53.440 --> 34:59.880]  look out at the stars you are amongst the stars you are part of that cosmos you
[34:59.880 --> 35:03.840]  are out here in the boondocks on the edge of the Milky Way galaxy looking in
[35:03.840 --> 35:10.040]  to the core think of that magic and majesty and then recognize that real
[35:10.040 --> 35:14.320]  life is going on around you everywhere and in that sense of wonderment and
[35:14.320 --> 35:20.500]  investigation you'll see the good in the world and it does outnumber the bad but
[35:20.500 --> 35:24.760]  then you realize that bad understands how the world works but seeks to keep the
[35:24.760 --> 35:30.400]  good from ever becoming awake and people say this is really dark you know
[35:30.400 --> 35:34.520]  you and we've done nightly news pieces with the documents the video clips one
[35:34.520 --> 35:37.640]  of the inventors of the polio vaccine saying yeah we know it killed millions
[35:37.640 --> 35:42.080]  of people it's real funny we've played those clips this isn't a joke this is
[35:42.080 --> 35:47.000]  absolute fact and the magnitude of it in suffering if you've ever watched a
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.800]  family member you're wheezing and battling for breath in their death bed
[35:51.800 --> 35:55.320]  dying of cancer and you know that depending on the cancers there are
[35:55.320 --> 35:59.160]  thousands of percentile and the government tries to cook the numbers
[35:59.160 --> 36:02.960]  keep it quiet kind of like unemployment numbers it's exponential the United
[36:02.960 --> 36:09.280]  States it leads the world in illness in cancer in obesity in every form of
[36:09.280 --> 36:16.080]  degenerative disease across the board neurological joint bone everything now
[36:16.080 --> 36:20.360]  our guest has done deep research separately I've gone over many documents
[36:20.360 --> 36:25.000]  I mean it's an ocean of them the problem is that there isn't evidence there's too
[36:25.000 --> 36:29.680]  much be like in a batting cage and they've got 50 machines firing balls at
[36:29.680 --> 36:33.960]  you so fast I mean it's it's there's there's no way to even deal with it all
[36:33.960 --> 36:41.160]  but Dr. Mary's monkey in a human story with the documents goes over it and is a
[36:41.160 --> 36:46.320]  very important window to understand and I'm not trying to argue with you Ed but
[36:46.320 --> 36:50.440]  yes I understand that in the documents and things they say it's and from the
[36:50.440 --> 36:55.280]  research it's a mistake that the polio vaccine got the sv-40 in it but and then
[36:55.280 --> 36:59.400]  you say gets darker later but but but quantify what you're saying because I've
[36:59.400 --> 37:03.600]  got the documents where they admit there's programs from cancer viruses to
[37:03.600 --> 37:10.960]  microplasms to chemicals to biologicals to GMO to not just kill us but damage the
[37:10.960 --> 37:15.040]  human genome I mean it's it's it's like an alien force was doing this it's so
[37:15.040 --> 37:21.760]  wicked well there's there's a lot of things to address there one of the
[37:21.760 --> 37:29.000]  things that really got my attention was that the main virus that they were
[37:29.000 --> 37:35.680]  working on with this radiation was sv-40 but in that same batch of polio was siv
[37:35.680 --> 37:42.520]  which is the ancestor virus to AIDS and the idea that they were using radiation
[37:42.520 --> 37:51.680]  to shoot inside this test tube that had both sv-40 and siv in it is an
[37:51.680 --> 37:57.240]  extremely dangerous activity in my opinion because that ionizing gamma ray
[37:57.240 --> 38:02.200]  radiation has the ability to damage the DNA it's meant to accelerate mutation
[38:02.200 --> 38:05.280]  tell them why they're shooting radiation right well they're in a hurry and
[38:05.280 --> 38:10.520]  they're trying to accelerate the mutation I mean hopefully looking for a
[38:10.520 --> 38:13.760]  benign strain but they're getting back stronger and stronger strain but let's
[38:13.760 --> 38:16.040]  go back to this question and I'm gonna and then I want you to have the form
[38:16.040 --> 38:18.960]  really you spend the rest of the hour and then go into the next breaking it
[38:18.960 --> 38:23.520]  down people can read the book and really find out more but again you're saying it
[38:23.520 --> 38:26.720]  is an accident I'm saying what about all these other admitted weapons programs
[38:26.720 --> 38:30.640]  where they're deploying it against the population and covering up today what
[38:30.640 --> 38:33.920]  they've done and you were saying well this was an accident but from your
[38:33.920 --> 38:40.200]  research what's the overall program well it's easier for me frankly to take the
[38:40.200 --> 38:44.080]  position that it was an accident than to prove the position that it's not an
[38:44.080 --> 38:50.480]  accident okay and so I took what I call the road to hell path road to Pell was
[38:50.480 --> 38:55.760]  paved with good intentions and I blame it on hasty public health decisions but
[38:55.760 --> 39:00.040]  I started getting into where did this polio epidemic come from in the first
[39:00.040 --> 39:08.120]  place okay so I went to the CDC and I got the data and it erupts in 1943 I'll
[39:08.120 --> 39:11.480]  send you the graph so we can put it on here now we're gonna do a nightly news
[39:11.480 --> 39:18.480]  thing on this to you so in what happens in 1942 they start the clinical use of
[39:18.480 --> 39:23.240]  antibiotics there is a direct relationship between the introduction of
[39:23.240 --> 39:29.920]  antibiotics and the onset of the polio epidemic which goes in 43 it jumps from
[39:29.920 --> 39:34.120]  about 2,000 a year to over 10,000 a year and doesn't come back down to that
[39:34.120 --> 39:40.640]  10,000 level until after the 50s okay so looking at this from the point of view
[39:40.640 --> 39:49.040]  of the pharmaceuticals they say well we there have to greatly restrict the use
[39:49.040 --> 39:53.240]  of antibiotics limit it to like syphilis and gonorrhea and those kind of
[39:53.240 --> 39:59.160]  things or we have to find a vaccine to stop this polio because the antibiotics
[39:59.160 --> 40:07.360]  are leading to the polio and that is a less kind analysis of where this is
[40:07.360 --> 40:11.200]  coming from than the one I just gave you about hasty public health decisions
[40:11.200 --> 40:16.240]  this means they knew that there was a connection between the two and they the
[40:16.240 --> 40:21.200]  reason that they pushed the polio thing with this Cold War hysteria that they
[40:21.200 --> 40:27.280]  did people in armbands going around collecting money and and just the most
[40:27.280 --> 40:32.640]  extreme language possible in the media was that they were trying to sell us on
[40:32.640 --> 40:40.600]  the idea of a coast-to-coast mandatory force to that vaccination and it was to
[40:40.600 --> 40:46.560]  protect their profits well I mean look I've gone over the documents how they
[40:46.560 --> 40:50.920]  say drug the water to control the population you know reduce population
[40:50.920 --> 40:53.960]  we've caught to you in adding sterilants to vaccines there's a long history the
[40:53.960 --> 40:57.240]  secret experimentation all of it that we know was going on against Native
[40:57.240 --> 41:01.120]  Americans and blacks and others where they were putting people in the 40s and
[41:01.120 --> 41:04.640]  50s in chambers and radiating in the death so we know that there was that
[41:04.640 --> 41:08.360]  eugenics based program I understand that they made mistakes as well that
[41:08.360 --> 41:12.560]  generated a lot of this but look at how until four years ago they said never take
[41:12.560 --> 41:15.600]  a vaccine when you're pregnant they knew it caused autoimmune responses and
[41:15.600 --> 41:19.960]  miscarriages right and and the baby lived all sorts of you know mental
[41:19.960 --> 41:25.120]  retardation other things now they say if you're a woman take extra so it's it's
[41:25.120 --> 41:29.280]  like they're fleeing forward you know it's like okay you caught us drug in the
[41:29.280 --> 41:32.920]  water we think there should be more drugs in the water oh you you know it's
[41:32.920 --> 41:37.080]  causing miscarriages the little baby really needs it when it's inside mommy so
[41:37.080 --> 41:41.920]  I mean I see them just like you just just really just enjoying what they're
[41:41.920 --> 41:44.800]  doing I mean the worst possible stuff they can do that's why I say that but
[41:44.800 --> 41:48.680]  continue tying it in to just how big it is I mean how many people from your
[41:48.680 --> 41:54.920]  research in the documents has this cancer affected we got back 15 well in the
[41:54.920 --> 42:01.240]  initial release of the polio vaccine between 1955 and 1963 and I'm talking
[42:01.240 --> 42:05.520]  about the ones that were injected which is worse and then the sugar cube all
[42:05.520 --> 42:12.800]  right there were 200 million people who got that is like 198 the problem is this
[42:12.800 --> 42:17.360]  thing is sexually transmitted it's communicable yes so if you didn't get
[42:17.360 --> 42:23.520]  it you still may have it and as playlock points out it's being found in
[42:23.520 --> 42:28.320]  grandchildren of people who got the initial polio I saw a report in AFP
[42:28.320 --> 42:33.440]  years ago 98% or something of all Indians in India have it and they say
[42:33.440 --> 42:39.680]  it's in the sewage well I didn't see that report but that's typical of the
[42:39.680 --> 42:43.720]  kind of stuff you discover once you start looking at it because you know I
[42:43.720 --> 42:48.980]  I found the as I mentioned earlier the NCI newsletter had it on the front page
[42:48.980 --> 42:56.640]  you know so I mean there's no denying this they are will argue with you over
[42:56.640 --> 43:01.920]  who I mean what happens but the more I got into it I mean I got a phone book
[43:01.920 --> 43:07.520]  from NCI NIH actually the NIH master phone book and in about 2001 somebody
[43:07.520 --> 43:11.400]  brought it to me gave it to me and I was able to look at the names and discover
[43:11.400 --> 43:18.840]  that it was one of Dr. Oschner's students that was now controlling the
[43:18.840 --> 43:27.320]  funding for NCI and she had married Al Rapson who was Sarah Stewart's boss and
[43:27.320 --> 43:32.440]  now this is the boss of the woman who discovers the cancer-causing virus
[43:32.440 --> 43:38.240]  right and then she's killed now well Sarah Stewart don't understand but then
[43:38.240 --> 43:41.840]  she was also just doing research and discovering stuff as well right yeah but
[43:41.840 --> 43:47.800]  I think that she was running this linear particle accelerator at the US public
[43:47.800 --> 43:51.720]  health under this program is what I mean right because what happens is she is
[43:51.720 --> 43:59.000]  the lead researcher on this cancer-causing virus stuff at NCI in 1960
[43:59.000 --> 44:05.320]  and she suddenly transfers from NCI to the US public health service weird career
[44:05.320 --> 44:09.720]  move when you're already at the top of the heap why would you do something like
[44:09.720 --> 44:14.480]  that to put you in charge of the facility that's got the radioactive
[44:14.480 --> 44:19.400]  equipment in it and that's why I think that she moved over there why did the
[44:19.400 --> 44:27.200]  killer Mary Sherman yes I think they wanted to expose the laboratory if they
[44:27.200 --> 44:30.600]  wanted to shut her up they could have shut her up more easily just by shooting
[44:30.600 --> 44:35.840]  or a stabbing or something but what happens is she grabs a handle that's
[44:35.840 --> 44:39.080]  loaded with millions of volts of electricity and she's standing in front
[44:39.080 --> 44:44.000]  of a steel wall and her arm burns out like a spark plug now usually when you
[44:44.000 --> 44:48.240]  have that much electricity it goes down to the floor and blows your feet off
[44:48.240 --> 44:53.880]  hers feet are fine it goes out this special steel wall that has a cable
[44:53.880 --> 44:57.880]  routed to the ground to protect the operators of the linear particle
[44:57.880 --> 45:02.760]  accelerator from the radiation and stuff okay so that's what blows out her
[45:02.760 --> 45:07.680]  arm but it has not crossed her heart so her heart is still beating and and she's
[45:07.680 --> 45:12.160]  you know like the rib cage is gone you can see the lungs and everything and the
[45:12.160 --> 45:18.440]  sun's about to come up you know and they terminate her by carefully stabbing
[45:18.440 --> 45:22.320]  her in the heart it's still pumping at the time so there's blood all over the
[45:22.320 --> 45:26.840]  place inside of her and then they put her in a body bag and they take her back
[45:26.840 --> 45:31.520]  to her apartment where they fake this murder scene and there they take a knife
[45:31.520 --> 45:36.520]  and do one of these jobs on her but you don't believe when you're dead okay so
[45:36.520 --> 45:40.080]  we know that those stab wounds particularly the one to her liver did not
[45:40.080 --> 45:43.920]  happen at the same time as the other one so we got two sets of stab wounds that's
[45:43.920 --> 45:47.120]  like dr. David Kelly the weapons inspector that exposed Blair and Bush
[45:47.120 --> 45:51.280]  lying there's no blood with his wrist slit and then the pills are undigested
[45:51.280 --> 45:55.400]  yeah yeah exactly I mean there are things that happen when you're alive okay
[45:55.400 --> 45:59.240]  and then they take her back to her apartment and they try to set her on
[45:59.240 --> 46:04.000]  fire okay well the fire there it doesn't even nobody even reports seeing a flame
[46:04.000 --> 46:10.640]  there's just a bunch of smoke okay and the curtains next to her bed don't burn
[46:10.640 --> 46:14.680]  and the paper label in the sherry bottle doesn't burn I mean there's not much
[46:14.680 --> 46:18.600]  heat there and the clothes that they pile on top of her and they stab her
[46:18.600 --> 46:22.880]  through the clothes because of V cuts in there okay those things burn at 500
[46:22.880 --> 46:28.560]  degrees and they didn't burn okay so you got a less than 500 degree fire and
[46:28.560 --> 46:32.800]  that's supposed to explain why her arm is not there I mean there's a basic
[46:32.800 --> 46:37.120]  forensic problem with the with the crime scene and then you have a Jagger
[46:37.120 --> 46:42.480]  Hoover document here yes this is very interesting because this is a document
[46:42.480 --> 46:48.160]  from Jagger Hoover instructing his agents not to investigate the Mary
[46:48.160 --> 46:53.680]  Sherman murder because of jurisdiction now if I'm right and she was
[46:53.680 --> 46:57.640]  electrocuted on federal property then the FBI did have jurisdiction and
[46:57.640 --> 47:04.480]  bringing her back to a private residence moved it from FBI jurisdiction
[47:04.480 --> 47:10.560]  to NOPD jurisdiction then the NOPD contacts the FBI and says oh my gosh
[47:10.560 --> 47:17.720]  look what we found we've got a name in her address book that you need to tell
[47:17.720 --> 47:24.120]  the boss about right and this says you know her arm and ribs were burned next
[47:24.120 --> 47:29.760]  sentence somebody's name was found in her address book this person they didn't
[47:29.760 --> 47:36.440]  bother to say first name they only said last name well the FBI director's gonna
[47:36.440 --> 47:41.120]  know this guy just by his last name just by his last name and it's six letters
[47:41.120 --> 47:45.600]  long and I'm looking at this and I'm saying well I got two witnesses that
[47:45.600 --> 47:51.120]  said they saw Oswald in Mary Sherman's apartment building are they telling the
[47:51.120 --> 47:56.200]  head of the FBI at the height of the Warren Commission investigation that the
[47:56.200 --> 48:00.840]  murdered woman had Oswald's name and telephone number in her address book
[48:00.840 --> 48:06.120]  okay so I contact the FBI and I say you know I don't think this ought to be a
[48:06.120 --> 48:09.720]  mystery you know this is not a theory at this point there's a name in here and
[48:09.720 --> 48:14.200]  we need to know what it is FBI says we're not telling you appeal to the
[48:14.200 --> 48:17.600]  Department of Justice so I do all the forms I appeal to the Department of
[48:17.600 --> 48:22.280]  Justice they say we're not telling you so they tell us we've got freedom of
[48:22.280 --> 48:28.200]  information they tell us we've got JFK Records Act this new openness okay but
[48:28.200 --> 48:33.480]  they're not willing to tell us this one we're almost 50 years later that's right
[48:33.480 --> 48:36.200]  and we can't even be told this and of course then there's all the background
[48:36.200 --> 48:39.320]  stuff about they're in New Orleans it's on record they were doing this weaponized
[48:39.320 --> 48:42.640]  cancer test you were you just skipping head because we're gonna do a whole like
[48:42.640 --> 48:46.440]  hour special report add all the documents and we'll have it ready you know in a
[48:46.440 --> 48:49.640]  week or two to air on the nightly news we're doing all sorts of video shoots and
[48:49.640 --> 48:52.680]  special reports or we can actually go over all the little men new show people
[48:52.680 --> 48:56.520]  can obviously get the book Dr. Mary's monkey that info wars.com and read it
[48:56.520 --> 49:02.040]  and it's forwarded by Jim Mars we also carry me and Lee will we'll talk about
[49:02.040 --> 49:08.720]  some we start the next hour when Jim Mars joins us but you you were saying a
[49:08.720 --> 49:14.600]  few years later after 61 62 63 it does start getting darker and you did dig up
[49:14.600 --> 49:19.240]  in the public and dig up where there are weaponized cancer programs autoimmune
[49:19.240 --> 49:24.520]  programs viral weapon programs imagine how advanced they are now get into that
[49:24.520 --> 49:29.200]  when things did start to get a little darker well I was told way back in the
[49:29.200 --> 49:34.160]  1960s that Mary Sherman had been connected with David Ferry who was one of
[49:34.160 --> 49:38.640]  Jim Garrison's main suspects and they were doing some kind of secret cancer
[49:38.640 --> 49:48.720]  research program and I that was a Mary Ferry and the monkey virus okay which
[49:48.720 --> 49:52.640]  was self-published and it's kind of an underground thing but that was the
[49:52.640 --> 49:58.960]  subject of the don't what I was missing was the witness the hole in the donut
[49:58.960 --> 50:04.080]  and then in the year 2060 minutes contacted me and said that they were
[50:04.080 --> 50:08.880]  researching this woman who kept telling them that she was the technician in the
[50:08.880 --> 50:14.280]  laboratory that I said had to happen and I mean the laboratory had to have a
[50:14.280 --> 50:19.360]  technician with very special training to handle these cancer-causing viruses and
[50:19.360 --> 50:27.400]  they showed up with this woman Judith very Baker who could prove that she had
[50:27.400 --> 50:31.760]  all that specialized training to handle cancer-causing viruses and I thought
[50:31.760 --> 50:36.760]  that was very interesting but then when they were able to show me tax documents
[50:36.760 --> 50:42.080]  and pay stubs to prove that she worked with Lee Oswald at the Riley Coffee
[50:42.080 --> 50:48.000]  Company in New Orleans at the they started on the same day they were there
[50:48.000 --> 50:52.040]  for a week and transferred from a subsidiary over to parent company
[50:52.040 --> 50:56.080]  amazing let's tie Dr. Mary's monkey in with the book that you helped put
[50:56.080 --> 50:59.800]  together me and Lee we'll tell folks about that when we come back in three
[50:59.800 --> 51:05.400]  minutes a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even
[51:05.400 --> 51:08.920]  if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led
[51:08.920 --> 51:13.400]  me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in
[51:13.400 --> 51:16.400]  the United States and across the industrialized world are almost
[51:16.400 --> 51:21.480]  completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that
[51:21.480 --> 51:26.040]  our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then
[51:26.040 --> 51:30.760]  searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[55:51.040 --> 55:53.920]  about five minutes left in this segment five minutes and then after that I'm
[55:53.920 --> 55:56.880]  gonna get you know Jim for you guys to cross over but tying the two books
[55:56.880 --> 56:00.560]  together and all the bio weapons experts and people you know that pop up in
[56:00.560 --> 56:06.240]  these reports well in 2000 I mentioned that 60 minutes brought me this
[56:06.240 --> 56:11.440]  witness and I was very interested to meet her and find out what her story
[56:11.440 --> 56:19.040]  really was and she was I really had to sit down with her for hours to sort out
[56:19.040 --> 56:24.040]  her story and get her timeline straight in my head and I finally realized that
[56:24.040 --> 56:29.920]  she could prove that when she was in high school in a dirt floor laboratory with
[56:29.920 --> 56:34.840]  no budget that she was giving cancer to mice faster than they were able to do it
[56:34.840 --> 56:40.880]  at the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society held a press
[56:40.880 --> 56:45.040]  conference on their annual press briefing down in St. Petersburg Florida
[56:45.040 --> 56:50.480]  which is right up the road from where this gal lived in Bradenton and she
[56:50.480 --> 56:56.320]  lots of moxie she crashes the American Cancer Society press briefing so that she
[56:56.320 --> 57:01.120]  can tell them about her discoveries okay and while they're about to throw her out
[57:01.120 --> 57:05.840]  the head of research comes over and says young lady why are you here and she
[57:05.840 --> 57:11.280]  says I got this information you know and so they let her stay and when they
[57:11.280 --> 57:17.560]  realize what she is saying that she is outperforming NCI on this they say we
[57:17.560 --> 57:20.800]  want to go to your laboratory and check it out and the guy picks up the
[57:20.800 --> 57:25.480]  telephone and calls his buddy Alte Noshner who is president of the American
[57:25.480 --> 57:30.480]  Cancer Society some years before and says Alton get down here I want you to
[57:30.480 --> 57:35.400]  meet this woman so Alton comes down with this other guy the counter all kind of
[57:35.400 --> 57:40.240]  older guys at this point in baggy gray suits right but the three men and Judy
[57:40.240 --> 57:45.400]  get in the car and go to her high school to check this out okay and the first
[57:45.400 --> 57:49.120]  thing they do is say this is the most dangerous thing we have ever seen we're
[57:49.120 --> 57:53.480]  shutting your lab down and secondly you're coming with us up to Buffalo New
[57:53.480 --> 57:57.920]  York so we can train you how to handle cancer-causing viruses properly all right
[57:57.920 --> 58:03.840]  and I said Judy who's the third guy I mean we got Dr. Dio and Oshner who's the
[58:03.840 --> 58:09.000]  third guy and she said his name was Yuri and he was from the University of
[58:09.000 --> 58:12.280]  Chicago that's and he knew a lot about radiation and that's all I know about
[58:12.280 --> 58:18.640]  him so I look up Yuri University Chicago radiation and we got Harold Yuri who was
[58:18.640 --> 58:24.400]  the head of the war sciences program at Columbia yeah or two he starts what
[58:24.400 --> 58:30.400]  becomes the Manhattan Project with Zyler and Fermi and they all move out to the
[58:30.400 --> 58:34.840]  University of Chicago after the war so that the question is not connecting
[58:34.840 --> 58:39.320]  Yuri to Judy it's why was Alton Oshner exactly stay there
[58:39.320 --> 58:49.120]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network
[58:50.920 --> 58:55.640]  hi folks this is Alex Jones I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot

[1:00:19.880 --> 1:00:26.760]  Alex Jones Ed Haslams with us for another 20 minutes Jim Mars will be joining us
[1:00:26.760 --> 1:00:32.080]  right in shotgun in the next segment thank you for joining us it is the 15th
[1:00:32.080 --> 1:00:37.680]  day of March 2012 we have former Congressman Bob Barr also pop against
[1:00:37.680 --> 1:00:42.440]  start of the next hour you're tying the two books by the way you're available in
[1:00:42.440 --> 1:00:46.560]  the online video bookstore at info wars.com Dr. Mary's monkey and also me
[1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:52.440]  and Lee you were tying these two together tell us about the book me and
[1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:56.760]  Lee cuz you were just tying that together folks just joined us well Judy who
[1:00:56.760 --> 1:01:00.960]  wrote this book wants to be the person that finds the cure for cancer that's
[1:01:00.960 --> 1:01:05.920]  her goal in life and so she throws herself head and foot into it when
[1:01:05.920 --> 1:01:10.040]  she's in high school and she starts getting help from the military she's
[1:01:10.040 --> 1:01:13.800]  got the documents to prove it she starts getting that was big in the 50s and
[1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:18.640]  60s my dad was involved in that in high school you know and and was sitting on
[1:01:18.640 --> 1:01:21.720]  the MD Anderson and stuff but it was across the board yeah right and it was
[1:01:21.720 --> 1:01:26.160]  the WizKid program yeah that was it yeah and so she was part of all that and
[1:01:26.160 --> 1:01:31.160]  she was getting a lot of support and she was really making progress so when she
[1:01:31.160 --> 1:01:36.200]  goes to this American Cancer Society meeting and they bring in Harold Urie to
[1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:42.600]  look at her laboratory he is with Alton Oshner this is March of 1961 okay
[1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:46.960]  that's right when this linear particle accelerator is going on in New Orleans
[1:01:46.960 --> 1:01:50.160]  how did she have the proof to get you know the head of the weapons program
[1:01:50.160 --> 1:01:56.680]  down there she had all of her notes I mean she was trained by the woman that
[1:01:56.680 --> 1:02:00.960]  was in charge of the local chapter of the American Cancer Society how to do
[1:02:00.960 --> 1:02:07.080]  stuff in the laboratory and she had this Colonel Philip Doyle looking over her
[1:02:07.080 --> 1:02:11.280]  shoulder as part of a project so she's so they're trying to find the young bright
[1:02:11.280 --> 1:02:15.960]  minds and they see her dad and like whoa that's right she can prove that she's
[1:02:15.960 --> 1:02:21.000]  giving cancer to mice in seven days what she's doing him is roasting him with
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:26.440]  radiation to lower their immune systems then she's putting him in TSA in
[1:02:26.440 --> 1:02:31.480]  chambers smoke chambers where she's pumping cigarette smoke in there so
[1:02:31.480 --> 1:02:35.400]  she's overexposing them to cigarette smoke at the same time she's lowering
[1:02:35.400 --> 1:02:40.200]  their immune system and she's getting back cancer tumors in seven days and
[1:02:40.200 --> 1:02:45.920]  nobody up at NCI is able to do it that fast so they realized that they had
[1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:50.320]  an asset who's too young to even be caught because nobody would believe she
[1:02:50.320 --> 1:02:54.800]  could do all this stuff and they bring her up that summer they don't waste any
[1:02:54.800 --> 1:02:59.400]  time they bring her up that summer up to the Roswell Park Cancer Institute up in
[1:02:59.400 --> 1:03:03.760]  Buffalo New York and they have her work in Dr. Moore's lab he's in charge of the
[1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:08.880]  entire thing and they train her especially to handle cancer causing
[1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:12.720]  viruses okay because they have questions they want to ask that they don't want to
[1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:17.960]  tell the public they're asking like will radiation from x-ray machines trigger
[1:03:17.960 --> 1:03:21.680]  cancer in the people with the cancer-causing virus in it from the
[1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:25.680]  polio vaccine I mean that's a huge question because that threatens the
[1:03:25.680 --> 1:03:31.160]  whole use of radiation and x-ray in American medicine and they have her
[1:03:31.160 --> 1:03:35.920]  doing those research oh a binary weapon you've got the cancer now you get the
[1:03:35.920 --> 1:03:40.000]  radiation and activates it that's right and they want to know if that works
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:44.800]  without asking it in public and Judy's got enough evidence to show that she was
[1:03:44.800 --> 1:03:50.000]  doing that research with human melanoma cells and radiation and those
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:55.360]  documents are in this me and Lee book so the first five chapters of this is all
[1:03:55.360 --> 1:04:01.280]  about Judy's cancer background she doesn't get into the Lee Oswald subject
[1:04:01.280 --> 1:04:08.360]  until 1963 when she gets a phone call from Dr. Oschner that says Judy how would

[1:04:35.480 --> 1:04:40.560]  she accepts the offer from Oschner and goes to New Orleans and she is
[1:04:40.560 --> 1:04:44.680]  intercepted she's there early I mean she calls Oschner and he's out of town she
[1:04:44.680 --> 1:04:49.280]  calls Mary German she's out of town they send somebody in to intercept her to
[1:04:49.280 --> 1:04:54.680]  hang on to her to make sure she's safe they send in an ex-marine by the name
[1:04:54.680 --> 1:05:00.080]  of Lee Harvey Oswald who does that and stay there I gotta hear about this a
[1:05:00.080 --> 1:05:05.440]  little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I
[1:05:05.440 --> 1:05:09.040]  had a pretty good-sized meal that was still starving and my research led me
[1:05:09.040 --> 1:05:13.240]  to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here
[1:05:13.240 --> 1:05:16.360]  in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost
[1:05:16.360 --> 1:05:21.480]  completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that
[1:05:21.480 --> 1:05:26.080]  our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then
[1:05:26.080 --> 1:05:30.880]  searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:38.520]  and we are back now into our number two we have the researcher and amazing
[1:08:38.520 --> 1:08:45.520]  investigative journalist who's written two books that for my own separate
[1:08:45.520 --> 1:08:51.400]  research completely check out with the facts and it's Edward T. Haslam Dr.
[1:08:51.400 --> 1:08:56.200]  Mary's monkey on the unsolved murder of a doctor a secret laboratory in New
[1:08:56.200 --> 1:09:00.760]  Orleans and cancer-causing monkey viruses are linked to Lee Harvey Oswald the
[1:09:00.760 --> 1:09:06.360]  JFK assassination in emerging global epidemics and then he also has that
[1:09:06.360 --> 1:09:13.800]  book forwarded by the JFK Grand Puba expert Jim Mars former crime reporter
[1:09:13.800 --> 1:09:18.760]  with the Fortress Star Telegram a first person to teach a college course on JFK
[1:09:18.760 --> 1:09:24.000]  then you have me and Lee how I came to know love and lose Lee Harvey Oswald and
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:30.600]  that's a Judith very Baker with a afterward by Jim Mars now Jim Mars
[1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:34.160]  will be with us for the full hour but I wanted to have some crossover here and
[1:09:34.160 --> 1:09:38.960]  I'm kind of springing this on him here we're gonna get into the world banking
[1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:45.120]  situation that you know the globalism out in the open the TSA all those other
[1:09:45.120 --> 1:09:48.960]  issues with with Jim but in this little short segment well 12 minute segment
[1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:52.960]  we've got now I wanted to have him specifically bring up points that is
[1:09:52.960 --> 1:09:58.080]  there's so much that are in these books and so these two can you basically have
[1:09:58.080 --> 1:10:05.160]  a discussion here about it Jim why are these books Dr. Mary's monkey and me
[1:10:05.160 --> 1:10:12.080]  and Lee's so important oh well that's an easy one Alex number one once you
[1:10:12.080 --> 1:10:19.320]  understand about the adulteration of the polio vaccine back to 50 then you'll
[1:10:19.320 --> 1:10:23.880]  begin to understand why there's been such an upsurge in the cancer rate so
[1:10:23.880 --> 1:10:29.600]  this is a story that affects millions of people I mean this actually impacts the
[1:10:29.600 --> 1:10:34.240]  public all right not some celebrity news that who cares except the people
[1:10:34.240 --> 1:10:41.240]  involved and the second thing is it also rips open the the incredible
[1:10:41.240 --> 1:10:46.840]  tangled and darkly woven chemistry behind the Kennedy assassination and
[1:10:46.840 --> 1:10:52.720]  shows you the interconnections between CIA FBI intelligence agency the
[1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:58.480]  military secret laboratory secret biochemical warfare testing the war
[1:10:58.480 --> 1:11:03.920]  against Castro and what role Lee Harvey Oswald played in all this he was not
[1:11:03.920 --> 1:11:10.160]  just some long snook off the street and if you'll read it's two books Dr. Mary's
[1:11:10.160 --> 1:11:17.560]  monkey and me and Lee you will find out not only what Lee Harvey Oswald was
[1:11:17.560 --> 1:11:22.720]  actually up to when he was in New Orleans in the summer of 1963 but how he
[1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:28.040]  connects into this matrix of powerful and violent groups that were behind the
[1:11:28.040 --> 1:11:34.880]  Kennedy assassination bottom line who was Lee Harvey Oswald he was a low-level
[1:11:34.880 --> 1:11:41.680]  intelligence agent probably picked up when he went in the Marines actually I
[1:11:41.680 --> 1:11:49.480]  remember his mother I remember his mother Marguerite telling me that one
[1:11:49.480 --> 1:11:54.440]  day when he was in junior high school he came home with a military officer and
[1:11:54.440 --> 1:11:59.080]  this military officer told him hey Lee's a sharp kid needs a self motivator a
[1:11:59.080 --> 1:12:04.400]  self-starter thanks for himself he said just the kind of guy we need so I
[1:12:04.400 --> 1:12:07.800]  think they had him tagged all the way back to junior high school and they
[1:12:07.800 --> 1:12:12.480]  groomed him he went to Marines and their gaps in his military records where he
[1:12:12.480 --> 1:12:16.880]  probably underwent intelligence training probably started off with the
[1:12:16.880 --> 1:12:21.680]  office of naval intelligence considering that the Marines are part of the Navy
[1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:27.080]  and then was probably passed along to the CIA and then there's a lot of evidence
[1:12:27.080 --> 1:12:31.040]  to show that by the time of the assassination he probably was working
[1:12:31.040 --> 1:12:36.200]  for military intelligence and CIA they all had their hooks in him and including
[1:12:36.200 --> 1:12:42.680]  up and including accepting money as an FBI informant so he was not just some
[1:12:42.680 --> 1:12:47.360]  guy off the street but the I think the evidence if it was all presented to the
[1:12:47.360 --> 1:12:52.680]  public would clearly show he probably did not shoot president sure I mean it's
[1:12:52.680 --> 1:12:58.560]  elementary that he's at a super secret U2 spy base in Japan he goes over to
[1:12:58.560 --> 1:13:03.200]  Russia Mary's a wife you're supposedly gets in bed with the KGB and then they
[1:13:03.200 --> 1:13:06.680]  just let him right back into the United States and then he lives with a family of
[1:13:06.680 --> 1:13:09.720]  white Russians for those that don't know what that means it's not a it's not a
[1:13:09.720 --> 1:13:13.640]  drink with vodka in it you know that that was anti-communist forces that got
[1:13:13.640 --> 1:13:17.280]  kicked out you know during that big war with the Bolsheviks I mean it's
[1:13:17.280 --> 1:13:26.440]  ridiculous add your take on Lee Harvey Oswald well in New Orleans he is part of
[1:13:26.440 --> 1:13:32.440]  this underground medical laboratory he plays a operational support role he is
[1:13:32.440 --> 1:13:39.320]  Judy's babysitter she is the asset they need to perfect the weapon and he is in
[1:13:39.320 --> 1:13:44.080]  the middle of it now Judy and Lee both get cover jobs at the Riley coffee
[1:13:44.080 --> 1:13:51.680]  companies on May 10th and they start in a subsidiary run by an ex FBI agent by
[1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:55.880]  the name of William Moynihan and then one week later they both transfer over to
[1:13:55.880 --> 1:14:00.120]  the Riley coffee company and the reason for this is that allows Moynihan to
[1:14:00.120 --> 1:14:04.240]  control their background checks so they don't find the word cancer in Judy's
[1:14:04.240 --> 1:14:08.960]  background and they don't find the word Russia in Lee's background because what's
[1:14:08.960 --> 1:14:12.840]  going on at the Riley coffee company most of the employees don't know and what
[1:14:12.840 --> 1:14:17.360]  it is is Judy and Lee are sneaking out of the Riley coffee company and going
[1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:22.200]  over to David Ferri's apartment and doing the work with the cancer tumors and
[1:14:22.200 --> 1:14:27.880]  the mice and so there's this loop of laboratories one laboratory is using
[1:14:27.880 --> 1:14:32.160]  the radiation another laboratory is growing the cancer tumors in the mice
[1:14:32.160 --> 1:14:35.880]  and then they bring the mice over to Ferri's where Judy and Lee kill them and
[1:14:35.880 --> 1:14:41.440]  chop them up and make a puree out of the tumors Judy brings it over to Mary
[1:14:41.440 --> 1:14:45.320]  Sherman's apartment she reviews the work and they send it back for more
[1:14:45.320 --> 1:14:49.760]  radiation this is the loop and what they're doing the first they kill the
[1:14:49.760 --> 1:14:54.960]  mice then they start using it on monkeys and they kill the monkeys and first they
[1:14:54.960 --> 1:14:58.920]  use of South American monkeys and then they use African monkeys which are more
[1:14:58.920 --> 1:15:03.880]  expensive okay then after they kill all these things with cancer they need to
[1:15:03.880 --> 1:15:08.640]  test it on a human so a human where do you get a human you can kill but nobody's
[1:15:08.640 --> 1:15:15.120]  gonna miss okay from Angola and a Tenturi and they take that human over to
[1:15:15.120 --> 1:15:19.880]  the Jackson the East Louisiana State Hospital which is the Jackson Mental
[1:15:19.880 --> 1:15:27.120]  Hospital and inject him with the weapon to see if he kills him okay now part of
[1:15:27.120 --> 1:15:33.920]  this is the story of Lee being seen in Clinton, Louisiana well Clinton's right
[1:15:33.920 --> 1:15:37.880]  down the road from Jackson okay and what they're trying to do is they're
[1:15:37.880 --> 1:15:41.800]  waiting for the prisoner to come over and they're gonna go up there in rendezvous
[1:15:41.800 --> 1:15:46.480]  so that when they arrive at the front gate there's this nice van with a state
[1:15:46.480 --> 1:15:50.400]  seal on it with a prisoner in it and there's a black Cadillac behind it
[1:15:50.400 --> 1:15:54.360]  being driven by Clay Shaw all right so they're gonna use that to sneak the
[1:15:54.360 --> 1:16:00.280]  weapon and ferry and Oswald into the hospital by the way it's come out that
[1:16:00.280 --> 1:16:05.520]  prisons is one of the favorite places to do these tests on people and just out
[1:16:05.520 --> 1:16:10.480]  at the Huntsville a prison in East Texas it's famous it's come out they give
[1:16:10.480 --> 1:16:14.080]  people stuff so bad they kill them all the time and it even kills the guards
[1:16:14.080 --> 1:16:17.920]  that makes them sick and even pops up in the paper mystery illnesses mystery
[1:16:17.920 --> 1:16:22.360]  deaths I mean it's just hidden in plain view but they forgot to read the
[1:16:22.360 --> 1:16:26.280]  newspaper they forgot to read that Martin Luther King was giving is I have a
[1:16:26.280 --> 1:16:32.240]  dream speech on August 28th so when they arrive in this town in Clinton to wait
[1:16:32.240 --> 1:16:38.520]  for the van they're expecting it to be empty because it's a hot August
[1:16:38.520 --> 1:16:43.400]  afternoon and what's really going on is because of the Martin Luther King speech
[1:16:43.400 --> 1:16:47.680]  the day before the Congress on racial equality has scheduled a black voter
[1:16:47.680 --> 1:16:51.920]  registration drive in this essentially clan controlled town so what you've got
[1:16:51.920 --> 1:16:54.840]  is you've got the Marshall standing in the middle with the whites on one side
[1:16:54.840 --> 1:16:58.160]  of the square the blacks on the other side of the square and into the scene
[1:16:58.160 --> 1:17:02.640]  drives this black Cadillac so the Marshall says you know who is this
[1:17:02.640 --> 1:17:08.160]  outside agitators press government what and so the Marshall John Manchester goes
[1:17:08.160 --> 1:17:13.200]  over and to the guy driving the car and says may I see your ID and the guy
[1:17:13.200 --> 1:17:17.360]  pulls out his driver's license and says I'm Clay Shaw of the international
[1:17:17.360 --> 1:17:21.400]  trademark and then Oswald gets out of the backseat and goes over and gets in
[1:17:21.400 --> 1:17:24.640]  line with the blacks and tries to register to vote and that's why we have
[1:17:24.640 --> 1:17:30.920]  the record of this yes but the record was given to the House Select Committee
[1:17:30.920 --> 1:17:36.280]  on Assassinations back in the 70s they took it in executive section stamped
[1:17:36.280 --> 1:17:41.680]  it secret and did not tell us that they knew that Oswald was connected to Clay
[1:17:41.680 --> 1:17:46.960]  Shaw which was the essence of Jim Garrison's case okay they marked it
[1:17:46.960 --> 1:17:50.680]  secret and it did not come out until after Oliver Stone's move incredible
[1:17:50.680 --> 1:17:53.680]  well you're gonna have to go through all of this in a special report we're gonna
[1:17:53.680 --> 1:17:58.640]  shoot I'm gonna continue with the radio show here but and and with Jim but just
[1:17:58.640 --> 1:18:02.240]  amazing work people can read it in both books me and Lee and Dr. Mary's monkey
[1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:06.040]  available at info wars.com Jim we're about to go to break but a few more
[1:18:06.040 --> 1:18:13.080]  minutes on the issues here that we've been covering yeah well of course I you
[1:18:13.080 --> 1:18:17.640]  know I've been digging into the whole story for years when I met Ed and when
[1:18:17.640 --> 1:18:21.680]  I was reading his books and then when I met and interviewed you the very
[1:18:21.680 --> 1:18:26.560]  backer and heard all this whole story number one it all fit it just fits so
[1:18:26.560 --> 1:18:30.800]  perfectly as to everything else we knew but then I went back and started
[1:18:30.800 --> 1:18:36.800]  backtracking and for example Ed says that the Oswald's work at Riley coffee
[1:18:36.800 --> 1:18:40.720]  company was just a charade that it actually was leaving and going over the
[1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:44.160]  left so I went back and looked at the Warren Commission volumes and I found
[1:18:44.160 --> 1:18:50.160]  the affidavit from his immediate supervisor there at Riley and he said
[1:18:50.160 --> 1:18:54.560]  you know I never could find Lee he just never was around and when I finally
[1:18:54.560 --> 1:18:58.640]  catch up with him and say where you been he'd say oh I've just been around you
[1:18:58.640 --> 1:19:04.280]  know and then Judith Baker said that one of her jobs was to clock Oswald out
[1:19:04.280 --> 1:19:09.160]  each day all right on the time clock and so I went back check the time clock
[1:19:09.160 --> 1:19:15.240]  records and sure enough he was supposed to be at work at 8 and he got off at 5
[1:19:15.240 --> 1:19:22.120]  well you know like any normal person he'd clock in at 759 801 758 you know
[1:19:22.120 --> 1:19:27.360]  right about 8 but then when he clocked out it was 5 o'clock being 5 o'clock

[1:24:19.120 --> 1:24:24.840]  you know what I think I'm gonna bring a wild card out here with investigative
[1:24:24.840 --> 1:24:29.360]  journalist Jim Mars in the short segment and we'll get into the world economy the
[1:24:29.360 --> 1:24:36.800]  wars all of it with him in the next but Jim I talked about this yesterday it
[1:24:36.800 --> 1:24:40.280]  obviously it's it's it's getting a lot of news coverage that they're trying to
[1:24:40.280 --> 1:24:46.200]  spin it but this former Goldman Sachs high-level managing director in fact
[1:24:46.200 --> 1:24:48.960]  guys we repull me those articles from yesterday there's new ones today thank
[1:24:48.960 --> 1:24:53.920]  you comes out and says yeah no they call everyone scum and we're here to rip
[1:24:53.920 --> 1:24:57.920]  everyone off and it's a culture where they don't want to make their clients
[1:24:57.920 --> 1:25:01.000]  money they want to rip them off which people know that's not a very good
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:04.320]  business model will know it's the biggest because they've got super high
[1:25:04.320 --> 1:25:08.720]  frequency computers that only they're allowed to use so the whole market the
[1:25:08.720 --> 1:25:14.200]  whole stock market now is a complete joke yeah yeah for years people I guess
[1:25:14.200 --> 1:25:17.920]  because I write books they think I know something and the people say you know
[1:25:17.920 --> 1:25:22.000]  what stocks should I invest in and Alex for years I've told them go to Las
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:28.040]  Vegas the odds are better there well no but that's it but I mean we had the
[1:25:28.040 --> 1:25:32.280]  Timberwolf emails that were a division of Goldman Sachs where they litter they're
[1:25:32.280 --> 1:25:37.360]  like I'm gonna sell these moron scum total crud and bet against it I mean it
[1:25:37.360 --> 1:25:43.840]  is just a insane level of corruption and you realize you realize Goldman
[1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:50.480]  Sachs was at the bottom so to speak of the Gulf oil explosion and the
[1:25:50.480 --> 1:25:54.640]  contamination of the whole Gulf and they now have some of the internal memos
[1:25:54.640 --> 1:26:00.720]  and one of the one of the Goldman Sachs execs was saying yeah bye bye fishy you
[1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:05.000]  know they don't care they don't care crazy people they're like I don't care
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:09.680]  of reactors we own are blowing up who cares if my kids breathe it I mean it
[1:26:09.680 --> 1:26:15.120]  it's just they're nuts they really are it's it's this is this even to me goes
[1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:20.880]  beyond greed I mean greed is one thing but hey Alex you're from Texas and you
[1:26:20.880 --> 1:26:24.720]  know a little bit about Texas history Texas was built by entrepreneurs and
[1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:30.120]  and you know corporate guys basically they call them trust then railroad
[1:26:30.120 --> 1:26:34.960]  cattle oil okay and these guys made millions and they were tough and they
[1:26:34.960 --> 1:26:40.600]  you know they would screw you over in a heartbeat but they also knew like their
[1:26:40.600 --> 1:26:45.120]  fathers and grandfathers who were farmers they knew you have to let the feel
[1:26:45.120 --> 1:26:50.240]  like fallow one season so that they give you a bumper crop the next they knew and
[1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:54.640]  that's why so many of the wealthy all guys in Texas would turn around and put
[1:26:54.640 --> 1:27:00.680]  money into the arts into the symphony into the operas into the culture of the
[1:27:00.680 --> 1:27:07.000]  town because they knew that when they built up the and helped prosper the
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:12.280]  golden goose they get more golden eggs but you don't see that today there's it
[1:27:12.280 --> 1:27:17.680]  goes beyond greed they are just it's like hey nothing's gonna last let's get
[1:27:17.680 --> 1:27:22.800]  our last penny out of everything exactly I mean you have really I think hit a
[1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:27.680]  deep truth here driven the nail right through the board that I mean other
[1:27:27.680 --> 1:27:32.280]  elites are boss hoggish and corrupt but they still like seeing people doing well
[1:27:32.280 --> 1:27:36.880]  they like building big palaces they like they understand a rising tide raises
[1:27:36.880 --> 1:27:40.600]  the ships and when they get in control a lot of times strongmen in history have
[1:27:40.600 --> 1:27:44.880]  actually made things better kind of the philosopher king in a way because because
[1:27:44.880 --> 1:27:48.280]  they want to see things prosper kind of like Gaddafi not saying he's a good guy
[1:27:48.280 --> 1:27:52.240]  but compared to the globalist he was good the globalist really do want to wreck
[1:27:52.240 --> 1:27:57.640]  everything they're psychos I was I'm not gonna get into it I was at an elite
[1:27:57.640 --> 1:28:02.680]  party last night I got taken to and and there were like some of the biggest
[1:28:02.680 --> 1:28:07.080]  people in the IT world there and they were acting like little kids hopping
[1:28:07.080 --> 1:28:10.640]  around like crazy people for three hours in front of me and it was it was funny
[1:28:10.640 --> 1:28:14.000]  in a way and I was about to shoot a YouTube video somebody goes don't do
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:19.120]  that but I mean I'm going this is who's running things really but you know what
[1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:24.720]  I think if you look around I think I'm losing count but right now there's like
[1:28:24.720 --> 1:28:31.040]  over 250 resignations of bank money managers some of these top guys it's
[1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:37.160]  like the rats are deserting the ship do you get that impression yes and in fact
[1:28:37.160 --> 1:28:40.080]  that's well that's been pointed out that hundreds are leaving why do you think
[1:28:40.080 --> 1:28:44.560]  that's happening they don't want to get the blame for what's coming exactly
[1:28:44.560 --> 1:28:48.400]  they don't want to have they don't want to have to be put in the stocks or put a
[1:28:48.400 --> 1:28:51.880]  noose around there next so they're getting out they see the whole thing
[1:28:51.880 --> 1:28:56.440]  crumbling in fact it's all just kind of the whole world economy right now as
[1:28:56.440 --> 1:29:02.320]  far as I can tell is kind of held together with you know spit glue all I
[1:29:02.320 --> 1:29:07.600]  know is when you're watching you know billionaires juggling glasses and
[1:29:07.600 --> 1:29:11.960]  apples and running around crazy at parties with the energy of five-year-olds
[1:29:11.960 --> 1:29:16.760]  and then you talk to these people and I'm not and you're like they must not be
[1:29:16.760 --> 1:29:20.640]  running things or I guess they're blowing off steam I mean I more and more I
[1:29:20.640 --> 1:29:23.800]  understand the it's like the elite are in control there are some of them that
[1:29:23.800 --> 1:29:26.760]  are actually trying to run things but more and more of the elite are just
[1:29:26.760 --> 1:29:30.880]  like running around like crazy people do you do you see what I'm saying Jim absolutely
[1:29:30.880 --> 1:29:36.040]  in fact it reminds me of my study of the last days of Hitler's Third Reich down
[1:29:36.040 --> 1:29:39.640]  in the buckers in Berlin and all like that they weren't sitting around hoping
[1:29:39.640 --> 1:29:47.240]  they were getting drunk exactly that's exactly what's going on we'll be right

[1:34:33.960 --> 1:34:37.160]  I didn't even realize is like some giant pop star in her own right that shows how
[1:34:37.160 --> 1:34:40.600]  ignorant I am it's really really nice lady it's not like me name-dropping hey
[1:34:40.600 --> 1:34:43.480]  Billy Corrigan founder of smashing pumpkins hanging out at the office hey
[1:34:43.480 --> 1:34:49.560]  Dave Mustaine hey I just got a call from this big movie star yesterday 95% or
[1:34:49.560 --> 1:34:55.520]  more of the big stars and people that contact me never want to go on air in
[1:34:55.520 --> 1:34:59.640]  fact Billy when we went out to dinner a few nights ago and then we went walk around
[1:34:59.640 --> 1:35:04.240]  the Capitol and stuff and I did Twitter a photo of it he's really interesting
[1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:09.240]  fellow really smart he wasn't even sure he wanted to do an interview he just
[1:35:09.240 --> 1:35:12.320]  wanted to meet and talk to me I'm gonna talk to him over the phone and stuff
[1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:19.200]  before that and the reason I tell you this story is it resonates with the
[1:35:19.200 --> 1:35:23.680]  fact that there is a giant awakening happening and Billy said the same thing
[1:35:23.680 --> 1:35:27.520]  he said just five years ago I heard no one talk about the New World Order or the
[1:35:27.520 --> 1:35:32.840]  Federal Reserve or you know poison in the water or global government he said
[1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:37.440]  now all around me at restaurants and all over I hear it you know hear it in
[1:35:37.440 --> 1:35:41.440]  elevators that's what I'm saying see those of you out there who aren't a
[1:35:41.440 --> 1:35:46.920]  radio host or TV host you're feeling like you're alone I want to tell you
[1:35:46.920 --> 1:35:51.280]  something you're not alone that's why I say it's important to wear an info
[1:35:51.280 --> 1:35:55.760]  wars.com t-shirt or a Ron Paul shirt something that were in the Fed shirt
[1:35:55.760 --> 1:36:01.760]  something that you know wear your colors so people can identify you know
[1:36:01.760 --> 1:36:05.400]  that's why bird species will have a red dot on them that's so birds of the same
[1:36:05.400 --> 1:36:08.600]  species can see that and tell that's a male that's a female you know that's why
[1:36:08.600 --> 1:36:12.840]  militaries wear uniforms why the police wear uniforms we need to be you know go
[1:36:12.840 --> 1:36:16.680]  out there and get those radar pangs because I'm not here giving you a pep
[1:36:16.680 --> 1:36:21.080]  rally because I'm I'm I'm giving you what I believe is veritas I see through a
[1:36:21.080 --> 1:36:25.960]  rose-colored darkly a scanner darkly like everybody else but I think my darkly
[1:36:25.960 --> 1:36:29.360]  is a little bit thinner than some and that's my goal in life is to make that
[1:36:29.360 --> 1:36:34.080]  darkly thinner and thinner and get as close to real reality as I can get I am
[1:36:34.080 --> 1:36:38.720]  in love with reality I am in love with creation and I'm in love with doing the
[1:36:38.720 --> 1:36:43.680]  right thing because it feels good in my soul when I risked my life and my name to
[1:36:43.680 --> 1:36:48.640]  fight tyranny it is fulfilling I even know that if I get arrested and set up
[1:36:48.640 --> 1:36:52.240]  and my name destroyed and horrible things said about me that is going to be
[1:36:52.240 --> 1:36:57.080]  fulfilling I don't look forward to being tortured if that happens but that is the
[1:36:57.080 --> 1:37:04.400]  fulfillment of the powerful resistance to evil that is the that is the pay dirt
[1:37:04.400 --> 1:37:10.160]  that is the and I'm telling you I'm delivering the good so are you so is
[1:37:10.160 --> 1:37:13.640]  your marks when you talk to somebody even if they don't look like they woke up
[1:37:13.640 --> 1:37:17.840]  then it may take 20 times before they wake up it may take like a seed you
[1:37:17.840 --> 1:37:23.560]  plant one year that a bulb add some bulbs I planted like two years ago and they
[1:37:23.560 --> 1:37:26.800]  didn't sprout and then I was going back by the old house I lived at and I saw
[1:37:26.800 --> 1:37:30.960]  that they had sprouted got moved I'm like wow that's that's those bulbs that
[1:37:30.960 --> 1:37:36.680]  didn't sprout but two years later they did is just finally some rain I guess
[1:37:36.680 --> 1:37:42.040]  that's the side issue I need I need to go back to Jim it's just a I'm like a
[1:37:42.040 --> 1:37:45.160]  person at a buffet I get all these guest dogs I want to talk to them and
[1:37:45.160 --> 1:37:47.920]  think they're neat and then I've got all these points I want to make maybe I
[1:37:47.920 --> 1:37:50.160]  turn into a five-hour show I guess I've kind of done that with the nightly
[1:37:50.160 --> 1:37:57.520]  news but the point is it's it is always darkest before the dawn but I'm here to
[1:37:57.520 --> 1:38:00.960]  give you the good news there is a giant awakening the bad news is the evil knows
[1:38:00.960 --> 1:38:08.920]  that and is just like Jim just said it's going more crazy now the system in the
[1:38:08.920 --> 1:38:13.120]  face of this is is just is just going wild and like he said in the Nazi
[1:38:13.120 --> 1:38:18.440]  bunkers not just that they're in Berlin but others there was sex partying
[1:38:18.440 --> 1:38:24.360]  delusions that they were going to win imaginary armies and it's like Nero or
[1:38:24.360 --> 1:38:29.920]  Rome I mean I'm seeing craziness just a few years ago the elite were more
[1:38:29.920 --> 1:38:33.120]  scared now I think they realized they don't control stuff like they thought
[1:38:33.120 --> 1:38:36.600]  so now they're just going into crazy land Jim Mars you've got the floor on
[1:38:36.600 --> 1:38:39.120]  that subject
[1:38:40.320 --> 1:38:45.600]  guys we need to say them up I'm sorry go ahead start over Jim oh yeah you're on
[1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:52.360]  go ahead well I tell you what the one that's blown me away is Defense
[1:38:52.360 --> 1:38:58.000]  Secretary Leon Panetta goes to Afghanistan and they disarm the Marines
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:01.840]  around him they made them stack their arms and they wouldn't let him get
[1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:06.680]  anywhere near him with weapons and I was in the military and that the thing they
[1:39:06.680 --> 1:39:10.760]  drum into your head and certainly is you don't do anything you don't go to the
[1:39:10.760 --> 1:39:15.600]  bathroom without your weapon handy okay you just don't do it and they just
[1:39:15.600 --> 1:39:23.280]  armed the Marines around Panetta who is he scared of okay wait I mean what more
[1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:28.760]  do you need that they disarm our own troops around the Defense Secretary
[1:39:28.760 --> 1:39:34.160]  because they know the troops are beginning to figure out that two is not
[1:39:34.160 --> 1:39:38.840]  five you know I think you're right I started the show with this today the
[1:39:38.840 --> 1:39:43.600]  magnitude that the Associated Press London Telegraph are all reporting and
[1:39:43.600 --> 1:39:46.960]  admitting that in the minute and the Pentagon admits the troops cannot be
[1:39:46.960 --> 1:39:50.320]  trusted well that's why they say the troops are the number one enemy because
[1:39:50.320 --> 1:39:54.680]  they know these are killing machines that are going to wake up to the fact
[1:39:54.680 --> 1:39:58.880]  that the evil Empire took over America and the fact that they're scared of the
[1:39:58.880 --> 1:40:02.680]  troops and by the way police they hate you too anybody who's been taught to use
[1:40:02.680 --> 1:40:07.160]  force and anybody who knows the secret that the veneer of civilization is very
[1:40:07.160 --> 1:40:11.680]  thin and that you don't you're not afraid to use violence these little
[1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:16.960]  criminals hate you as Henry Kissinger said and want to kill you and that's
[1:40:16.960 --> 1:40:20.720]  why they inject you with soft kill cancer viruses when you're in the military
[1:40:20.720 --> 1:40:24.360]  now there are ways to try to counteract that but we've got it on record
[1:40:24.360 --> 1:40:28.600]  everyone that joins the military unless they're part of an elite family is given
[1:40:28.600 --> 1:40:34.800]  soft killed binary weapon systems so that by the time you hit 40 or 50 you
[1:40:34.800 --> 1:40:39.320]  start degenerating it's a self-destruct mechanism you're a robot that's meant to
[1:40:39.320 --> 1:40:43.120]  shut down because they know you're going to become self-aware most humans I
[1:40:43.120 --> 1:40:47.400]  found are unconscious and are basically biological androids when you become
[1:40:47.400 --> 1:40:51.520]  illuminated and again the the Illuminati creates counterfeits of everything real
[1:40:51.520 --> 1:40:56.160]  when you become awake that's self-aware not all humans are self are really
[1:40:56.160 --> 1:40:59.720]  self-aware they're trying to keep you from becoming self-aware with this whole
[1:40:59.720 --> 1:41:04.440]  control system and with the military they know you're becoming self-aware so
[1:41:04.440 --> 1:41:08.080]  they're building kill switches in what do you think about that Jim? Oh absolutely
[1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:13.400]  and I mean you know this is corporate mentality taken to the nth degree you
[1:41:13.400 --> 1:41:17.640]  create this killing machine and then you program it to self-destruct and that
[1:41:17.640 --> 1:41:22.800]  way you don't have to pay a lot of medical expenses VA treatments and you
[1:41:22.800 --> 1:41:28.960]  know retirement you know get rid of it's and all you have to do and you have
[1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:33.840]  Alex and the people who have apologized you for some time all you have to do is
[1:41:33.840 --> 1:41:37.560]  look at their own publications look at with the statements from people like
[1:41:37.560 --> 1:41:44.520]  Maxwell Taylor or Prince Philip or look at some of the publications from the
[1:41:44.520 --> 1:41:48.300]  Council on Foreign Relations I mean they just they make no bones about it they
[1:41:48.300 --> 1:41:53.040]  want to reduce the world's population by at least a third maybe two-thirds and
[1:41:53.040 --> 1:41:57.760]  wait a minute how you can do that you got to kill people and that's what they're
[1:41:57.760 --> 1:42:03.680]  into yeah I mean I'm not a fan of Saddam Hussein CIA on record put into power
[1:42:03.680 --> 1:42:09.080]  that whole history is there but not publicized and he could go out and
[1:42:09.080 --> 1:42:14.480]  stand in front of 10,000 people with grenade launchers and AK-47s firing in
[1:42:14.480 --> 1:42:20.480]  the air but the Defense Secretary says disarm the Marines when my helicopter
[1:42:20.480 --> 1:42:29.600]  lands exactly now here's another disconnect excuse me this my allergies
[1:42:29.600 --> 1:42:33.920]  are going down oh man it's hitting me hard as well yeah okay here's another
[1:42:33.920 --> 1:42:39.160]  disconnect now think about this we're in Afghanistan to begin with because we
[1:42:39.160 --> 1:42:44.440]  went in there to get Osama bin Laden well oops wait a minute he we didn't get
[1:42:44.440 --> 1:42:49.680]  him if we did get him according to the official story we got him here you know
[1:42:49.680 --> 1:42:56.080]  last year and we've already got him and if you really studied you find he's
[1:42:56.080 --> 1:43:02.320]  probably been dead since December of 2001 but anyway so the call celebrate for
[1:43:02.320 --> 1:43:06.760]  going to Afghanistan is no longer there so what's the rationale for us keeping
[1:43:06.760 --> 1:43:10.400]  troops in Afghanistan a country that's never been conquered by anybody
[1:43:10.400 --> 1:43:14.840]  including the British Empire and the Russian Empire all right well it's
[1:43:14.840 --> 1:43:20.520]  because we say well we can't pull our troops out until the Army the Afghan
[1:43:20.520 --> 1:43:27.080]  Army and the police forces are able to maintain control in that country which
[1:43:27.080 --> 1:43:30.720]  sounds good on paper but wait a minute folks and you've been reading the papers
[1:43:30.720 --> 1:43:34.520]  it's some of those Army guys and some of those police guys have been shooting at
[1:43:34.520 --> 1:43:39.840]  us they want us out of their country and I don't blame them I'd want red China out
[1:43:39.840 --> 1:43:45.200]  of Texas okay and yet we don't seem to catch this oh well we got to stay there
[1:43:45.200 --> 1:43:49.080]  so we can train their people but train them so they can kill us and shoot at us
[1:43:49.080 --> 1:43:55.920]  well people are like we're losing in Afghanistan we're not because we're
[1:43:55.920 --> 1:44:00.640]  not there the global bankers have got our military there to get the 500 billion
[1:44:00.640 --> 1:44:06.280]  a year conservatively an opium that again they get exposed growing it so they
[1:44:06.280 --> 1:44:08.760]  go well the troops are getting upset about growing the opium we'll have them
[1:44:08.760 --> 1:44:12.600]  form up in front of her all over there we'll have them admitted on TV and the
[1:44:12.600 --> 1:44:16.040]  psych warfare chiefs are like what's the point of that don't you get it hide in
[1:44:16.040 --> 1:44:20.800]  plain view it loses its power that's right and that's why by the way that's
[1:44:20.800 --> 1:44:25.520]  why the famous football star Pat Tillman you know he told all his buddies man when
[1:44:25.520 --> 1:44:28.280]  I get out I'm gonna go home tell everybody we're just over here guarding
[1:44:28.280 --> 1:44:33.640]  the the poppy fields and oh well he shot my head coming back from some routine
[1:44:33.640 --> 1:44:39.600]  mission by some snipers who just happened to just joined his outfit come on
[1:44:39.600 --> 1:44:46.720]  folks wake up spell the coffee yeah that he was a big PR bonanza for him but
[1:44:46.720 --> 1:44:52.600]  going in but they didn't want him coming out but in his murder that first they
[1:44:52.600 --> 1:44:56.880]  launched he charged single-handedly an al-qaeda nest been locked and might have
[1:44:56.880 --> 1:45:01.200]  even been there literally he was incredible the fire he took and how
[1:45:01.200 --> 1:45:04.360]  many al-qaeda's he took out turned out there was no one around they killed him
[1:45:04.360 --> 1:45:08.040]  he hid behind a rock is saying yeah after they already shot him a few times
[1:45:08.040 --> 1:45:11.720]  and they came up and they killed him right and and then the army the good
[1:45:11.720 --> 1:45:15.280]  news is the army coroner the Colonel would not lie and said this is homicide
[1:45:15.280 --> 1:45:21.880]  yeah well I mean you know a couple of taps to the head I don't think those
[1:45:21.880 --> 1:45:26.200]  Taliban are that good a shot besides that according to the reports I saw he was
[1:45:26.200 --> 1:45:29.960]  heading back and he was waving his arms he said hey it's me it's Pat Tillman you
[1:45:29.960 --> 1:45:36.480]  know me BAM BAM they should come on folks get with it of course you know then
[1:45:36.480 --> 1:45:40.320]  all they got do is throw some money and have a TV special or some especially
[1:45:40.320 --> 1:45:44.360]  make movie and turn the whole thing around and put the you know cover it all
[1:45:44.360 --> 1:45:48.680]  look at how they killed five members of the Private Lynch's unit the
[1:45:48.680 --> 1:45:51.720]  survivors were like she had she didn't fight anybody they're like oh you're all
[1:45:51.720 --> 1:45:57.960]  dead well same deal hey you know but those guys that supposedly went in and
[1:45:57.960 --> 1:46:04.040]  got Osama bin Laden well oh gee they got killed in the helicopter crash yeah
[1:46:04.040 --> 1:46:07.720]  they just crammed 23 of them on to an old rickety helicopter they're like and
[1:46:07.720 --> 1:46:11.200]  then but on the news they were going to a rescue mission to rescue people in the
[1:46:11.200 --> 1:46:15.840]  army and then later was like well that wasn't true right and then I've talked
[1:46:15.840 --> 1:46:20.080]  I mean I don't know why everybody believes anything anymore
[1:46:20.080 --> 1:46:26.520]  hey Alex my motto has become I don't believe anything's true until the
[1:46:26.520 --> 1:46:35.040]  government denies it exactly hey let's bring this up because it's so big I
[1:46:35.040 --> 1:46:39.000]  want to go back to it soldiers asked to disarm during Leon Panetta's speech in
[1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  Afghanistan and they said for the safety of the Secretary of Defense this is a
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:47.560]  guy who announced last week that yes the military is under UN command and the
[1:46:47.560 --> 1:46:53.400]  Congress has no authority over that exactly I'm sure his his hidden thought
[1:46:53.400 --> 1:46:58.560]  was oh my god what if they arrest me for treason because that's treasonous
[1:46:58.560 --> 1:47:03.400]  folks okay the Constitution says only Congress has the power to declare war
[1:47:03.400 --> 1:47:08.200]  now they've abdicated that time after time going all the way back to the phony
[1:47:08.200 --> 1:47:14.040]  Gulf of Tonkin incident which didn't even happen and then but but Linda Johnson
[1:47:14.040 --> 1:47:19.560]  says our boys are floating in the water and I brought out the power to respond
[1:47:19.560 --> 1:47:23.880]  so they passed the Gulf of Tonkin resolution in Congress which gave him
[1:47:23.880 --> 1:47:29.080]  the power to wage war in Vietnam okay and it was all based on a lie and a
[1:47:29.080 --> 1:47:33.280]  total phony thing and that's not some conspiracy theory that was an article in
[1:47:33.280 --> 1:47:38.640]  US News and World Report ten or fifteen years ago the phony battle that led to
[1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:45.920]  war okay it's just fact and but but at least Congress acted even though
[1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:51.880]  irresponsibly but now Panetta before Congress says no we only send the
[1:47:51.880 --> 1:47:59.440]  military in when foreign organization approve that like NATO okay a direct
[1:47:59.440 --> 1:48:03.280]  violation of the Constitution United States and I know when I went in the
[1:48:03.280 --> 1:48:08.520]  army I took an oath to defend not the president not the secretary of the
[1:48:08.520 --> 1:48:14.520]  defense but the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign
[1:48:14.520 --> 1:48:20.160]  or domestic and I'm here to tell you land Panetta and about three quarters of
[1:48:20.160 --> 1:48:25.840]  Congress are domestic enemy they are I mean by the very textbook if it's not
[1:48:25.840 --> 1:48:28.760]  just like Caesar taking over and saying I'm the king that's bad enough at least
[1:48:28.760 --> 1:48:32.460]  he was Roman they're saying no no we work for foreign powers and the Senate's
[1:48:32.460 --> 1:48:36.640]  like well that violates article one section 8 clause 11 they're like doesn't
[1:48:36.640 --> 1:48:40.040]  matter yeah and by the way we don't trust the troops around us with guns now
[1:48:40.040 --> 1:48:44.680]  take those guns away from those Marines you know they might actually take their
[1:48:44.680 --> 1:48:50.720]  oath to the Constitution seriously well that shows their NSA chatter that the
[1:48:50.720 --> 1:48:55.920]  military and that's what I get I I gotta save the troops I talked to especially
[1:48:55.920 --> 1:49:00.280]  they're actually combat troops I mean I run into some of these pencil pushers
[1:49:00.280 --> 1:49:05.200]  oh yeah yeah rear echelon guys yeah who literally don't know how to lace up their
[1:49:05.200 --> 1:49:09.200]  own boots but when you run into real soldiers I gotta say they're almost all
[1:49:09.200 --> 1:49:12.400]  of them are awake I don't really run into any of them that are idiots that
[1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:15.320]  be compared to the public the military is completely awake as I guess they live
[1:49:15.320 --> 1:49:20.680]  in the real world well I wonder if that's why that the most campaign
[1:49:20.680 --> 1:49:24.640]  contributions from the rank and follow the Army Navy and Air Force have come
[1:49:24.640 --> 1:49:31.320]  to Ron Paul boy is talking truth and it says we don't need to be fighting in
[1:49:31.320 --> 1:49:36.520]  those other countries well I tell you Ron Paul has come out but now it's not
[1:49:36.520 --> 1:49:39.960]  getting any attention that he has been defrauded he did win in the early states
[1:49:39.960 --> 1:49:44.120]  and they just blacked it out well that's it so so now they're disarming our
[1:49:44.120 --> 1:49:50.200]  soldiers now and then shooting them up with deadly vaccines and and all kinds
[1:49:50.200 --> 1:49:55.560]  of test experimental drugs and then they're they're taking our boat away
[1:49:55.560 --> 1:50:00.920]  from us and yet everybody's just going along you know hey everyone that's
[1:50:00.920 --> 1:50:05.080]  listening to this program take it upon yourself to go out and try to wake up one
[1:50:05.080 --> 1:50:09.960]  other person just one other person okay just say hey ask him hey if we're
[1:50:09.960 --> 1:50:13.760]  supposed to be so afraid of terrorists how come they won't secure the border and
[1:50:13.760 --> 1:50:19.440]  ask him hey what about that third tower that went down in New York on 9 11 you
[1:50:19.440 --> 1:50:22.860]  know do you know about that we'll look into it you know try to get them
[1:50:22.860 --> 1:50:29.040]  wake up it's just more of us than there are of them if we just say no it all
[1:50:29.040 --> 1:50:32.800]  come to a screeching halt are you seeing the big awakening I'm seeing Jim oh
[1:50:32.800 --> 1:50:36.400]  absolutely I see it all over the place the problem is everybody thinks they're
[1:50:36.400 --> 1:50:42.360]  alone they don't and because you don't see it on the mass corporate media it's
[1:50:42.360 --> 1:50:46.200]  like Sheldesh Q and Romania but finally unless people stood up it's like wow you
[1:50:46.200 --> 1:50:52.480]  don't like the government either really it's all there and they just got us
[1:50:52.480 --> 1:50:58.560]  count and they've got us bamboozled by I mean think about play stay there stay

[1:54:21.400 --> 1:54:25.240]  see that he's the guy talking about the big banks in the new world order he
[1:54:25.240 --> 1:54:42.480]  never gives an answer see the world spinning around Jim arts with us five
[1:54:42.480 --> 1:54:45.420]  minutes the next hour then we've got former congressman Bob Barron about the
[1:54:45.420 --> 1:54:50.520]  TSA the police state and more I forget the point you were getting to and we
[1:54:50.520 --> 1:54:56.000]  went to break you got cut off but I got to raise this this Coney 2012 thing with
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:59.880]  George Bush in it and all these globalist it's just a convenient boogie
[1:54:59.880 --> 1:55:04.960]  man to invade Africa that's now admitted the resolutions entered but the makers of
[1:55:04.960 --> 1:55:09.700]  the film went there to propagandize and the population chased them trying to
[1:55:09.700 --> 1:55:14.320]  stone them saying don't try to invade our country we know what you're doing no
[1:55:14.320 --> 1:55:19.080]  unseen Joseph Coney in six years I mean the Africans they're not living in
[1:55:19.080 --> 1:55:23.080]  fantasy land they know that when the UN says they want to invade to help folks
[1:55:23.080 --> 1:55:30.120]  they know that means get ready to die yep what do you make of that Jim I think
[1:55:30.120 --> 1:55:36.560]  that's exactly right you know the thing is traditionally Republican
[1:55:36.560 --> 1:55:40.680]  Democrat doesn't matter traditionally every time the economy gets in a band
[1:55:40.680 --> 1:55:46.680]  it's war it gets us out of it okay so they're trying to stir up anything they
[1:55:46.680 --> 1:55:50.280]  can they've they've had a hard time trying to get us to go against Iran
[1:55:50.280 --> 1:55:54.600]  because there's the big risk of getting China and Russia involved plus Iran
[1:55:54.600 --> 1:56:00.480]  wouldn't it gonna be some pushover like Iraq was and so they haven't problem
[1:56:00.480 --> 1:56:04.320]  with that so now it's well let's go to some African nation you know we go to
[1:56:04.320 --> 1:56:11.000]  Wally Gamba and nobody's gonna know or care and so yes that's exactly it this
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:16.240]  is their old modus operandi okay so it's nothing new it's exactly what they
[1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:20.320]  try and of course once you get a war started then you have to rally around
[1:56:20.320 --> 1:56:24.560]  the chief you have to you know support the troops you have to you know the same
[1:56:24.560 --> 1:56:28.640]  old bromide and look at them but speaking of the chief
[1:56:28.640 --> 1:56:34.640]  look at the past few months man oh man is it Centauri is it Sarah Palin is it
[1:56:34.640 --> 1:56:40.040]  is it Romney they're all fighting and they say this and they counter with that
[1:56:40.040 --> 1:56:44.840]  and by the way don't don't even don't even mention Ron Paul I mean he's just a
[1:56:44.840 --> 1:56:49.040]  nut he can't win so for goodness sakes don't look at him let's don't include him
[1:56:49.040 --> 1:56:54.680]  in the debate because he offers a real alternative but through all of that where
[1:56:54.680 --> 1:57:01.720]  was our attention on Barack Hussein Obama it wasn't there he's just skating
[1:57:01.720 --> 1:57:08.840]  and he's got a free ride didn't he he does man he is power grabbing and he's
[1:57:08.840 --> 1:57:13.160]  been doing you know he's run up the biggest deficit in US history he's
[1:57:13.160 --> 1:57:18.000]  reneged on every single one of his campaign promises he's created all these
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:23.760]  czars that have no real experience in government or business and yet they're
[1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:30.760]  now trying to redefine our whole society I mean he you know never mind the whole
[1:57:30.760 --> 1:57:37.280]  constitutional issues that are involved with the White House right now it it's
[1:57:37.280 --> 1:57:41.680]  incredible and yet he's getting a free ride because mass media keeps us
[1:57:41.680 --> 1:57:47.840]  distracted with just almost anything and everything else what do you think the
[1:57:47.840 --> 1:57:52.760]  flashpoint is is do things just continue to rot or do you see some upheaval
[1:57:52.760 --> 1:57:59.320]  coming well I see some upheaval but I unfortunately I don't see it stemming
[1:57:59.320 --> 1:58:04.960]  from an IRA population I see it coming because of external forces more
[1:58:04.960 --> 1:58:11.880]  earthquakes more tsunamis more volcanoes more tornadoes geophysical
[1:58:11.880 --> 1:58:17.720]  changes and then of course that would precipitate economic collapse too what
[1:58:17.720 --> 1:58:21.040]  do you think's driving that I mean obviously we pay Al Gore money that's
[1:58:21.040 --> 1:58:24.680]  not gonna fix it why do you think there are statistically more earthquakes and
[1:58:24.680 --> 1:58:29.680]  things happening it was a tsunami as you know yesterday at Japan right well I
[1:58:29.680 --> 1:58:35.680]  don't know but I'll tell you what they've been predicting that a massive
[1:58:35.680 --> 1:58:41.800]  body is coming into our solar system stay there stay there stay there you are

[2:00:01.080 --> 2:00:12.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[2:00:12.600 --> 2:00:20.120]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:00:20.120 --> 2:00:31.320]  Alex Jones former congressman Bob Bars and the join us after the break on a
[2:00:31.320 --> 2:00:35.600]  host of issues including the TSA the ignoring of the war powers act
[2:00:35.600 --> 2:00:41.120]  everything I should add best-selling author Jim Mars is with us his website
[2:00:41.120 --> 2:00:47.680]  is jimmars.com and Jim of course is a best-selling author you were getting
[2:00:47.680 --> 2:00:53.560]  into where you asked me why I thought that all these earth changes these
[2:00:53.560 --> 2:00:59.640]  geophysical changes are taking place and number one I don't know and in fact I'm
[2:00:59.640 --> 2:01:05.000]  not sure anybody knows for sure or if they do they're not telling us but what
[2:01:05.000 --> 2:01:08.920]  I was saying is is that I have news clippings all the way back into the 80s
[2:01:08.920 --> 2:01:13.120]  where they were saying that they had evidence that there was a some other
[2:01:13.120 --> 2:01:18.400]  body that was moving into a massive object moving into our solar system and
[2:01:18.400 --> 2:01:23.560]  what I do know for a fact is is that these changes are taking place are not
[2:01:23.560 --> 2:01:29.440]  limited to just the earth the polar caps on Mars are decreasing meaning that that
[2:01:29.440 --> 2:01:34.440]  ice is melting there's ice on some of the moons of Jupiter yeah but if you pay
[2:01:34.440 --> 2:01:38.560]  all your money he'd fix it I don't go yeah yeah we just need to put in a carbon
[2:01:38.560 --> 2:01:43.600]  tax and we can take care of that but then Sunspot activity is acting very
[2:01:43.600 --> 2:01:47.920]  erratic ice on these moons are melting the outer planets becoming more
[2:01:47.920 --> 2:01:54.400]  luminescent whatever's going on it's impacting our entire solar system now
[2:01:54.400 --> 2:01:59.000]  what exactly that is and what does it mean I don't know I'm not sure
[2:01:59.000 --> 2:02:03.880]  anybody does but all you got to do is look around you the youth I know you've
[2:02:03.880 --> 2:02:09.080]  mentioned the seaballs up in the Pittsburgh in Norway yeah the governments
[2:02:09.080 --> 2:02:12.160]  of corporations are acting like it's the end of the world they're all digging
[2:02:12.160 --> 2:02:16.320]  in that's right in fact they think think about this folks go to the FEMA
[2:02:16.320 --> 2:02:21.000]  website and the government website for FEMA and they will tell you if you're a
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:26.880]  smart you will stockpile enough food and water for three days okay and yet the
[2:02:26.880 --> 2:02:31.320]  government is building these huge underground bunker cities and they're
[2:02:31.320 --> 2:02:38.560]  stockpiling enough weapons food water the last 10 20 30 years okay so what is it
[2:02:38.560 --> 2:02:43.080]  they know and that they're not telling you and in Switzerland the public all
[2:02:43.080 --> 2:02:47.880]  has at least two-year supply underground generators water everything for
[2:02:47.880 --> 2:02:53.680]  their low tax rate on the population our government even per capita spent a lot
[2:02:53.680 --> 2:02:58.160]  more but those are top-secret only the elite gets them about those bases Jim
[2:02:58.160 --> 2:03:01.280]  because the government cares about us that's right well you know all I think
[2:03:01.280 --> 2:03:06.400]  about is when I was young man every major city had bomb shelters fully stocked
[2:03:06.400 --> 2:03:11.320]  with food water and everything else because of the Cold War and the fear
[2:03:11.320 --> 2:03:15.920]  that we might have a nuclear exchange well you know where's the civil defense
[2:03:15.920 --> 2:03:21.560]  today we don't have any because they don't care they want us dead and that's
[2:03:21.560 --> 2:03:25.400]  nothing folks when you listen Alex Jones and other people like this they're
[2:03:25.400 --> 2:03:28.120]  hollering and screaming and they're telling you better watch you better do
[2:03:28.120 --> 2:03:33.240]  something about all this listen this is not just politics this is not just
[2:03:33.240 --> 2:03:39.560]  getting involved with civics this is self-defense okay because these people
[2:03:39.560 --> 2:03:44.840]  want you dead and you better understand that you better start doing something or
[2:03:44.840 --> 2:03:50.280]  they're gonna get their wishes and they say they want us dead and and they
[2:03:50.280 --> 2:03:55.760]  admit all of this but it's all in scholarly documents it's but more and
[2:03:55.760 --> 2:04:01.680]  more they are publicly circulating it and it is we've got to come together

[2:04:55.800 --> 2:05:05.600]  front a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if
[2:05:05.600 --> 2:05:09.040]  I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led
[2:05:09.040 --> 2:05:13.560]  me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in
[2:05:13.560 --> 2:05:16.440]  the United States and across the industrialized world are almost
[2:05:16.440 --> 2:05:21.680]  completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that

[2:07:01.480 --> 2:07:05.240]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[2:07:05.240 --> 2:07:09.000]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[2:07:09.000 --> 2:07:13.480]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[2:07:13.480 --> 2:07:17.720]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[2:07:17.720 --> 2:07:22.360]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[2:07:22.360 --> 2:07:26.320]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[2:07:26.320 --> 2:07:30.480]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[2:07:30.480 --> 2:07:34.440]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[2:07:34.440 --> 2:07:38.600]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[2:07:38.600 --> 2:07:42.360]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar

[2:08:03.720 --> 2:08:10.760]  presents the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[2:08:10.760 --> 2:08:15.080]  all right we just talked to Bob Barr during the break and he thought he was
[2:08:15.080 --> 2:08:20.000]  on at 130 Central 230 Eastern but he says to be ready in five minutes because I
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:24.120]  want to hear what he has to say about his lawsuit with TSA and all the rest of
[2:08:24.120 --> 2:08:30.080]  it so he should be joining us here in about five minutes speaking of TSA news
[2:08:30.080 --> 2:08:36.720]  we did a report at mfolwars.com yesterday that got national
[2:08:36.720 --> 2:08:42.120]  attention via the drudge report.com and other sites that the big Orlando
[2:08:42.120 --> 2:08:49.400]  airport is looking at kicking the TSA out because it's killing tourism there's
[2:08:49.400 --> 2:08:55.520]  different numbers they vary widely between 20 billion 40 plus billion but
[2:08:55.520 --> 2:09:03.000]  the latest numbers are over 40 billion dollars in lost revenue to communities
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:08.960]  around this country and to this nation and to individuals obviously and to the
[2:09:08.960 --> 2:09:14.040]  parasitic government and tax money 40 billion dollars a year in lost tourism
[2:09:14.040 --> 2:09:20.600]  but Goldman Sachs that runs this country just doesn't care and you saw the
[2:09:20.600 --> 2:09:23.720]  headlines yesterday were one of their top managing directors came out and said
[2:09:23.720 --> 2:09:30.440]  I'm quitting I can't be part of a culture where we hate our customers and
[2:09:30.440 --> 2:09:35.480]  try to rip them off in fact I know you guys brought that back into me I meant
[2:09:35.480 --> 2:09:39.760]  to cover that again or did you guys bring that back in because I don't I
[2:09:39.760 --> 2:09:45.120]  don't see it here in my stack will you report me the Goldman Sachs exact Smith
[2:09:45.120 --> 2:09:52.520]  that I want to read his exact quotes I don't want to just I don't want to just
[2:09:52.520 --> 2:09:56.480]  give people my take on it yeah here it is maybe I'll ask Bob Bar about this too
[2:09:56.480 --> 2:10:01.280]  so I'll get to that later after Bob Bar leaves us here's the type of news I see
[2:10:01.280 --> 2:10:06.120]  all the time but it's from cyber news service CNS news comm it's in Texas
[2:10:06.120 --> 2:10:12.120]  newspapers when this stuff happens every few weeks now in fact they've stopped
[2:10:12.120 --> 2:10:17.080]  pledging allegiance not because they see it as fascistic as some people do in
[2:10:17.080 --> 2:10:21.440]  South Texas I was down there and saw in the papers last year but because it's
[2:10:21.440 --> 2:10:27.320]  racist and they've stopped in San Antonio you get in trouble if you say USA USA
[2:10:27.320 --> 2:10:32.520]  by the way if you're a new listener I'm not joking it'd be like of ten years ago
[2:10:32.520 --> 2:10:36.200]  I went on the radio and said yeah the TSA they're put in the airports that's a
[2:10:36.200 --> 2:10:42.560]  federal power grab they're gonna start grabbing your genitals no one would
[2:10:42.560 --> 2:10:45.360]  believe that they'd be like you know what buddy that's crazy you've gone too
[2:10:45.360 --> 2:10:49.480]  far now it's like yeah what's the big deal oh they go in the pants yeah that's
[2:10:49.480 --> 2:10:59.120]  freedom but what am I getting at I you know grew up born here in Texas and grew
[2:10:59.120 --> 2:11:06.360]  up going down across the border to go sightsee to go buy hats and burrows
[2:11:06.360 --> 2:11:13.000]  whatever knives bullwebs you know just fun stuff you want your kid
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:19.440]  araheads you know stuff like that and I have been in the last five six years down
[2:11:19.440 --> 2:11:25.760]  to a few of those places it looks like a war zone once vibrant border towns on
[2:11:25.760 --> 2:11:31.160]  both sides are hell holes with everything boarded up there are rocket
[2:11:31.160 --> 2:11:36.600]  attacks there are newspaper people being killed on both sides there is total
[2:11:36.600 --> 2:11:41.240]  fear and our criminal government doesn't care because it's shipping the guns down
[2:11:41.240 --> 2:11:46.880]  to Mexico to further destabilize things and the border region now is basically
[2:11:46.880 --> 2:11:56.320]  Mexico and I see articles like this gun battle in Mexico forces US to shut down
[2:11:56.320 --> 2:12:02.520]  to border crossings well actually when I was down by the border last year I went
[2:12:02.520 --> 2:12:06.760]  down to South Padre it was in the newspaper that there were gun battles
[2:12:06.760 --> 2:12:10.040]  you know outside the high school football game well it turned out was
[2:12:10.040 --> 2:12:14.160]  actually in the parking lot and then there were Mexican troop helicopters
[2:12:14.160 --> 2:12:22.480]  over on the US side and again this is just going on every day now and there
[2:12:22.480 --> 2:12:26.040]  are lakes that border Mexico and you see the cases where a husband wife around
[2:12:26.040 --> 2:12:30.880]  on jet skis and Mexican red car till shoot and kill the husband and the
[2:12:30.880 --> 2:12:35.200]  national media says shut up woman your husband drowned because there's no
[2:12:35.200 --> 2:12:40.680]  violence down there I mean this is a perfect psiop example of where you got
[2:12:40.680 --> 2:12:43.440]  a better chance of dying look up the statistics scientific American even in
[2:12:43.440 --> 2:12:45.520]  a report on this two years ago it's where we got a lot of our numbers
[2:12:45.520 --> 2:12:52.040]  champagne courts bee stings you know I talk about this at nauseam slipping and
[2:12:52.040 --> 2:12:57.720]  falling I mean are just many times more dangerous than terrorism but you would
[2:12:57.720 --> 2:13:03.400]  believe it was the end of the world no it's just a federal power grab that's
[2:13:03.400 --> 2:13:08.280]  all that's going on here meanwhile it's over 40,000 dead down the last what
[2:13:08.280 --> 2:13:13.760]  almost four years on the Mexico side it's over 2,000 on our side I mean that's
[2:13:13.760 --> 2:13:19.560]  that's huge that's war level we were losing what 2,000 troops a year in
[2:13:19.560 --> 2:13:25.320]  Iraq we're losing more than that and it's not even on the radar because they
[2:13:25.320 --> 2:13:29.360]  don't want you to be scared of something real they don't want you to be
[2:13:29.360 --> 2:13:32.560]  concerned about a real security threat because they're gonna use this to merge
[2:13:32.560 --> 2:13:36.040]  the entire continental security perimeter as they said four years ago the North
[2:13:36.040 --> 2:13:42.360]  American Union SPP documents but here's CNS news gun battles in Mexico force US
[2:13:42.360 --> 2:13:46.080]  to shut down two border crossings several gun battles between Mexican
[2:13:46.080 --> 2:13:50.240]  military forces and drug traffickers from the US authority is same one
[2:13:50.240 --> 2:13:53.920]  shipping guns in the Mexico temporarily shut down two international bridge
[2:13:53.920 --> 2:13:58.320]  crossings on the southwest border last week the two bridges are located at the
[2:13:58.320 --> 2:14:01.960]  US Customs and Border Protection Port of Entry in Eagle Pass Texas
[2:14:01.960 --> 2:14:10.520]  connecting Eagle Pass Texas to the Padres Negros in Mexico and it just goes
[2:14:10.520 --> 2:14:16.760]  on and this is all in the local newspapers but this is not in the
[2:14:16.760 --> 2:14:22.520]  national news unless it's CNS news or drudge reporter in full wars it just not
[2:14:22.520 --> 2:14:27.920]  being discussed it doesn't exist who has covered that impeachment proceedings
[2:14:27.920 --> 2:14:31.760]  that legislation of Obama continues to launch wars on congressional approval
[2:14:31.760 --> 2:14:35.880]  that impeachment is gonna be triggered you'd think that'd be a top news story it
[2:14:35.880 --> 2:14:41.520]  has never been anywhere but info wars calm from day one drudge report from day
[2:14:41.520 --> 2:14:47.960]  one and then world that daily and I every day I keep doing a search I found
[2:14:47.960 --> 2:14:53.480]  some little Gazette a small town some small town paper did a story on it I'm
[2:14:53.480 --> 2:14:58.200]  checking with with a Google search every newspaper in this country every day
[2:14:58.200 --> 2:15:06.680]  going come on come on this has got this has got to become a news item that we've
[2:15:06.680 --> 2:15:10.600]  got to force this out there now we are forcing the story out there it's it's
[2:15:10.600 --> 2:15:15.320]  been forced on a talk radio it is being discussed it is a big buzz in the
[2:15:15.320 --> 2:15:21.280]  military big buzz in Congress but it's like you got one world that's on the
[2:15:21.280 --> 2:15:27.600]  internet that knows this stuff's going on and then you've got people who do not
[2:15:27.600 --> 2:15:31.160]  know anything they don't know the branches of government they don't know
[2:15:31.160 --> 2:15:37.480]  about the Constitution and they think you're a weirdo if you want to know
[2:15:37.480 --> 2:15:49.280]  about this stuff they think fashion or sports is paramount and I know as
[2:15:49.280 --> 2:15:53.160]  listeners you know this I know you know this before you ever heard my radio
[2:15:53.160 --> 2:15:56.600]  show people have always marveled at how some people don't care don't want to be
[2:15:56.600 --> 2:16:00.840]  involved but those out there that do brush up against this show or other
[2:16:00.840 --> 2:16:05.960]  shows like it you need to understand there's a reason our economy is falling
[2:16:05.960 --> 2:16:10.160]  apart there's a reason corruptions at all-time highs there's a reason we're
[2:16:10.160 --> 2:16:22.360]  losing our optimism and it's because you can't have freedom if you do not have
[2:16:22.360 --> 2:16:30.400]  an informed population and I and people are like duh no kidding Sherlock look I
[2:16:30.400 --> 2:16:35.320]  know that seems really simple if you don't have liberty you're not gonna have
[2:16:35.320 --> 2:16:42.280]  prosperity if you don't have liberty then you do not have freedom they're
[2:16:42.280 --> 2:16:46.600]  like yeah liberties freedom look a lot of people don't get that they're like I
[2:16:46.600 --> 2:16:51.560]  don't care the government gets rid of our rights I have nothing to hide really
[2:16:51.560 --> 2:17:00.440]  do you think say a German or a French what was Gaul 20 200 years ago when the
[2:17:00.440 --> 2:17:04.320]  Romans were first starting to make forays into those areas to get slaves and
[2:17:04.320 --> 2:17:09.160]  gladiators and the rest of it I mean you think somebody fishing in say what's
[2:17:09.160 --> 2:17:15.840]  Gaul today or what's Austria today do you think somebody fishing when a bunch of
[2:17:15.840 --> 2:17:19.800]  Roman soldiers come marching over the hill do you think they did anything wrong
[2:17:19.800 --> 2:17:25.960]  do I mean do you think they know people want to enslave you they want to kill
[2:17:25.960 --> 2:17:28.520]  you and grab your women and haul them back over the hill and take them back
[2:17:28.520 --> 2:17:32.640]  to Rome and and and that's the point people need to get this through their
[2:17:32.640 --> 2:17:36.840]  heads and I'm talking to new listeners here just because you don't have
[2:17:36.840 --> 2:17:41.640]  something to hide that oh go ahead and take my privacy go ahead and make me
[2:17:41.640 --> 2:17:53.440]  guilty until proven innocent that idea is slavery that idea is the end of our
[2:17:53.440 --> 2:17:57.680]  society people say oh defend America oh Alex America's under attack we got to
[2:17:57.680 --> 2:18:01.840]  give our rights up what is America I mean America's not a perfect history but
[2:18:01.840 --> 2:18:09.440]  compared to others it's been the benchmark in freedom and that's what
[2:18:09.440 --> 2:18:14.560]  America is it's a set of ideas and a culture and a system and because we were
[2:18:14.560 --> 2:18:20.720]  so free we developed the wealth and so the powerful entrance came in and took
[2:18:20.720 --> 2:18:28.800]  control because we were the biggest baddest thing in town
[2:18:29.240 --> 2:18:35.640]  does he want to go down is he on the phone what does he want he can give us
[2:18:35.640 --> 2:18:41.640]  30 minutes right let's do bottom of the hour bottom of the hour we're doing
[2:18:41.640 --> 2:18:46.480]  producing on the air which is good hey come on in here Chris because that's an
[2:18:46.480 --> 2:18:49.120]  interesting point because you he said five minutes and would you call him back
[2:18:49.120 --> 2:18:54.160]  and he's happy either way I don't care what it will watch his preference what's
[2:18:54.160 --> 2:18:57.880]  his preference yeah let's not have it all broken up with breaks let's so he's
[2:18:57.880 --> 2:19:05.120]  happy at 33 after let's just get him on then 33 after good job I
[2:19:05.120 --> 2:19:10.800]  don't know it just seems like common sense I mean why would police want to
[2:19:10.800 --> 2:19:16.440]  stomp on people's rights when those are your rights to why would why would why
[2:19:16.440 --> 2:19:21.320]  would bureaucrats get off on boss and people around I mean do you want to
[2:19:21.320 --> 2:19:25.360]  live in a country where people act like that I mean this is your country too I
[2:19:25.360 --> 2:19:33.360]  mean what did Fred call it and I hate to use potty humor here but it's the only
[2:19:33.360 --> 2:19:40.440]  thing that works don't pee in the pool man I mean how does I go to public pools

[2:24:27.240 --> 2:24:34.560]  going I mentioned this earlier whenever I had the one the only Jim Mars on with
[2:24:34.560 --> 2:24:37.520]  us but we were covering so many topics so fast we didn't spend a lot of time on
[2:24:37.520 --> 2:24:45.840]  it we've got a big video coming out this afternoon that I want to go viral you
[2:24:45.840 --> 2:24:48.880]  know you never know what's gonna go viral I shot like four videos over the
[2:24:48.880 --> 2:24:53.280]  weekend just when I get mad I shoot a video and uploaded to the YouTube
[2:24:53.280 --> 2:24:58.120]  channel and all total they have like a million and a half views you know when
[2:24:58.120 --> 2:25:03.720]  I'm got like 600 something thousand by itself because I tend to get focused when
[2:25:03.720 --> 2:25:06.720]  I'm alone or just at home with the family because I get in the office and
[2:25:06.720 --> 2:25:10.160]  there's the crew and facts and things coming at me and it's fine it's just
[2:25:10.160 --> 2:25:15.120]  that I can really more cogent walking around in the woods with a little video
[2:25:15.120 --> 2:25:23.520]  camera but we we have a report we shot yesterday that Aaron stayed up most
[2:25:23.520 --> 2:25:27.040]  the night putting together that's gonna go up I don't know the title of it yet
[2:25:27.040 --> 2:25:31.840]  but it deals with the huge African invasion and all the proof of that and
[2:25:31.840 --> 2:25:36.360]  I think Aaron's spitting it out right now I wonder if he had time to add this I
[2:25:36.360 --> 2:25:43.000]  wish but by spitting it out the computers know rendering it which is one of
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:52.120]  the longest processes but my problem is when we're so right so often we don't
[2:25:52.120 --> 2:25:57.320]  ever toot our horn properly about how right we've been not so oh look I'm
[2:25:57.320 --> 2:26:01.480]  smart but so people understand we know what we're talking about I've noticed
[2:26:01.480 --> 2:26:05.360]  there's a Cointel pro operation because I've tracked it to sock puppet
[2:26:05.360 --> 2:26:11.440]  accounts other things on info wars and similar deal on YouTube I can go look
[2:26:11.440 --> 2:26:15.240]  their channels their history and search the names and I've done it you know just
[2:26:15.240 --> 2:26:19.920]  to study how the globalist operate they have both hired PR people but then they
[2:26:19.920 --> 2:26:25.160]  also have actual just software systems that do it and that's on record but it's
[2:26:25.160 --> 2:26:29.800]  like Alex Jones nothing he said ever came true and they're like he said
[2:26:29.800 --> 2:26:34.800]  there'd be war and Iran it never happened well if you think bombs going off
[2:26:34.800 --> 2:26:39.800]  every week military bases getting blown up and people being assassinated and
[2:26:39.800 --> 2:26:44.440]  magnet bombs being thrown on the cars and the media admitting that a proxy
[2:26:44.440 --> 2:26:48.000]  wars going on it I mean if you I mean I guess you know I said a bunch of wars
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:50.720]  were coming in the Middle East about two years ago to be proxy wars from
[2:26:50.720 --> 2:26:54.360]  documents they're like that never happened really you don't think Libya you
[2:26:54.360 --> 2:26:59.960]  don't think Egypt you don't think Syria you don't call those wars through
[2:26:59.960 --> 2:27:04.960]  proxies I told you the Arab Spring was staged because it was staged on record
[2:27:04.960 --> 2:27:09.600]  Google which I told you was run by the NSA that's now admitted the head of the
[2:27:09.600 --> 2:27:15.960]  NSA runs Google now the former head and so there's always this spin like
[2:27:15.960 --> 2:27:19.520]  other Alex what came true well World Government well that it would be run by
[2:27:19.520 --> 2:27:22.920]  mega banks whether they would start openly saying they were gonna drug the
[2:27:22.920 --> 2:27:27.000]  water well that happened to but what else that they start using military on
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:29.840]  the streets that they start saying to you in command of the military okay that
[2:27:29.840 --> 2:27:33.280]  that they start disarming the troops around officers oh that's happening well
[2:27:33.280 --> 2:27:35.680]  you were right there again that the government brings in the drugs and was
[2:27:35.680 --> 2:27:38.760]  shipping the guns into Mexico six years ago I told you and would blame the
[2:27:38.760 --> 2:27:42.640]  Second Amendment for it then that all got leaked okay you were right about that
[2:27:42.640 --> 2:27:50.000]  but Alex has never right about anything you think it was fun day one coming out
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:54.080]  and saying 9-11 was an inside job and losing 70 plus percent of my affiliates
[2:27:54.080 --> 2:27:59.960]  because I wouldn't shut up no but it had to be done and you know it's one of my
[2:27:59.960 --> 2:28:04.720]  most valuable accomplishments is that I could care less about being popular or
[2:28:04.720 --> 2:28:08.600]  how much money I was making that it was about I'm gonna tell the truth that's
[2:28:08.600 --> 2:28:13.000]  what has value to me and the fact that that idea is so rare as why we're in all
[2:28:13.000 --> 2:28:21.320]  this trouble that is my most prized possession is that I am uncompromising
[2:28:21.320 --> 2:28:28.320]  with the truth and I have courage and I'm not a coward because I understand you
[2:28:28.320 --> 2:28:34.440]  can't give in to evil that's that's that's valuable that's not chapters I
[2:28:34.440 --> 2:28:42.720]  look back at and think oh man I I'd be a lot bigger you know the system needs to
[2:28:42.720 --> 2:28:46.840]  pat me on the head and to make me think that I somehow have achieved something
[2:28:46.840 --> 2:28:54.040]  because it's there you know now giving me entree no I don't want that but we
[2:28:54.040 --> 2:29:00.720]  called I'll be honest though we did not call the county thing 100% right it was
[2:29:00.720 --> 2:29:05.360]  a lot worse than what I said we were dead on that was a new boogeyman launch
[2:29:05.360 --> 2:29:09.080]  operation now the UN admits that it's all public nine countries they want to
[2:29:09.080 --> 2:29:12.640]  invade in Africa with boogeymen in each one most of them haven't been seen in
[2:29:12.640 --> 2:29:15.400]  years perfect boogeymen who are probably dead so they can just blast
[2:29:15.400 --> 2:29:20.720]  everything the UN slaughtering people all over Uganda and Congo right now huge
[2:29:20.720 --> 2:29:26.600]  oil everything found there and here it is Coney 2012 video screening met with
[2:29:26.600 --> 2:29:32.000]  anger in northern Uganda and all over the country but they've got minions of

[2:29:34.360 --> 2:29:40.000]  completely blowing up because they know it is just abject total bull and a
[2:29:40.000 --> 2:29:44.640]  pretext to invade Africa nothing to do with Joseph Coney just a bad guy

[2:33:59.880 --> 2:34:07.720]  it the well I'll get into it later the point is across cultural lines everybody
[2:34:07.720 --> 2:34:12.400]  is sick of the TSA it is the big issue like nothing I've ever seen that has
[2:34:12.400 --> 2:34:20.280]  unified Americans along political lines religious lines racial regional everyone
[2:34:20.280 --> 2:34:25.560]  I know and I've seen the polls it's 90 plus percent cannot stand what the TSA is
[2:34:25.560 --> 2:34:29.560]  doing there's some conformist out there who on the news will say oh I don't like

[2:34:35.640 --> 2:34:40.280]  children to what top psychologists have said is pedophilia training to have

[2:35:00.360 --> 2:35:03.760]  other areas trying to defend liberties and I want to discuss some of those with
[2:35:03.760 --> 2:35:07.920]  him as well but a police are give us the latest and thank you for joining us on
[2:35:07.920 --> 2:35:15.560]  what's happening in your investigation and sparring with the TSA thanks very
[2:35:15.560 --> 2:35:19.840]  much Alex it's great to be back with you and your many many listeners once
[2:35:19.840 --> 2:35:25.840]  again by the way just as a sidelight on TSA about a week ago I was traveling and
[2:35:25.840 --> 2:35:34.840]  at a certain airport and I showed the the TSA a person by congressional ID as a
[2:35:34.840 --> 2:35:39.320]  former member of Congress I have an official government ID that identifies
[2:35:39.320 --> 2:35:43.440]  me as a former member of Congress it has an official government seal it says
[2:35:43.440 --> 2:35:48.520]  right on the face but that's US government identification has my name
[2:35:48.520 --> 2:35:54.840]  and so forth and the guard looked at it and he said I can't accept this do you
[2:35:54.840 --> 2:35:58.680]  have a driver's license and I said yes but that's an official government ID
[2:35:58.680 --> 2:36:04.280]  certainly is good for purposes of getting on an airplane well wait over
[2:36:04.280 --> 2:36:11.440]  here so he puts me aside and calls over a supervisor and the supervisor a
[2:36:11.440 --> 2:36:17.560]  gentleman probably about 50 years old he looks at it studies it under one of
[2:36:17.560 --> 2:36:21.280]  their little their little flashlight things that they think are so impressive
[2:36:21.280 --> 2:36:27.680]  shines a light on it and says I'm gonna have to look this up and I said well
[2:36:27.680 --> 2:36:32.080]  fine it's fine with me and then the other guy pipes up and says this guy refused
[2:36:32.080 --> 2:36:36.760]  to show me a driver's license I said I didn't refuse anything I just indicated
[2:36:36.760 --> 2:36:41.200]  to you that this was an official government ID so the guy the other guy
[2:36:41.200 --> 2:36:46.520]  then literally takes about five minutes to thumb through a couple of little
[2:36:46.520 --> 2:36:50.600]  little books that they have with the various forms of identification they
[2:36:50.600 --> 2:36:54.160]  says it's it's not in here I've never seen it before and I said well it doesn't
[2:36:54.160 --> 2:36:58.600]  matter whether you've seen it before it's an official government ID and but
[2:36:58.600 --> 2:37:02.480]  it's not in my book I said well it that's fine it's still an official
[2:37:02.480 --> 2:37:09.600]  government ID I the this is sort of typical Alex out of the other problems
[2:37:09.600 --> 2:37:15.640]  that that are that are magnified tens of thousands of times daily across the
[2:37:15.640 --> 2:37:21.080]  country just a minor problem but you know the more serious problems are the
[2:37:21.080 --> 2:37:25.040]  ones that you do you know you just mentioned and that that our organization
[2:37:25.040 --> 2:37:31.360]  Liberty Guard is is fighting we began this battle with that TSA back in
[2:37:31.360 --> 2:37:37.560]  November of 2010 you recall of course but that's when they started really
[2:37:37.560 --> 2:37:44.040]  hassling people and we began and started issuing cards to people we being
[2:37:44.040 --> 2:37:48.760]  Liberty Guard the opt-out alliance informing people giving them a little
[2:37:48.760 --> 2:37:55.720]  card if they if they wrote in or emailed into a delivery guard or and we sent
[2:37:55.720 --> 2:38:00.560]  them a card an opt-out alliance card that explained their rights you know if
[2:38:00.560 --> 2:38:04.600]  they wanted that they have a right to opt-out of one of these naked body
[2:38:04.600 --> 2:38:12.760]  scanners they have they have a right to have a private private frisk done and
[2:38:12.760 --> 2:38:17.760]  so forth and I don't agree with any of that but the point is that if you don't
[2:38:17.760 --> 2:38:21.760]  want to go through one of these naked body scanners you do have the right to
[2:38:21.760 --> 2:38:26.960]  opt-out and and then you have certain rights there under well and almost
[2:38:26.960 --> 2:38:33.120]  immediately after there was this big flap the and a group a number of folks
[2:38:33.120 --> 2:38:39.600]  were calling for an opt-out day all of a sudden right before Thanksgiving of 2010
[2:38:39.600 --> 2:38:45.240]  the TSA backed away and didn't use the machines well we thought this was mighty
[2:38:45.240 --> 2:38:49.160]  interesting that they make this big push they say these machines are absolutely
[2:38:49.160 --> 2:38:54.120]  essential and air travel safety will be severely compromised if not and so forth
[2:38:54.120 --> 2:38:58.480]  and then all of a sudden they don't do it when they're faced with a public
[2:38:58.480 --> 2:39:03.200]  backlash well of course we couldn't get any information out of them we filed a
[2:39:03.200 --> 2:39:07.200]  freedom of information act request and they denied them said oh this isn't
[2:39:07.200 --> 2:39:11.520]  covered we can't give this to you it's sensitive information so forth anyway we
[2:39:11.520 --> 2:39:15.720]  had this running paperwork battle with them for quite some time and finally we
[2:39:15.720 --> 2:39:19.320]  decided the Liberty Guard the only way to really get to the bottom of this is to
[2:39:19.320 --> 2:39:27.000]  file suit so we have filed suit and in US court in Virginia against TSA simply
[2:39:27.000 --> 2:39:33.480]  seeking access to the information that led them to both first say that these
[2:39:33.480 --> 2:39:37.720]  machines are essential and then all of a sudden they back away from it and we want
[2:39:37.720 --> 2:39:42.600]  to see the documents and that's the that's the status of our of our lawsuit
[2:39:42.600 --> 2:39:49.080]  right now Liberty Guard versus the the TSA now I want to give out websites and
[2:39:49.080 --> 2:39:52.280]  other contacts for folks that want to get the card because people say well
[2:39:52.280 --> 2:39:56.880]  what's the point of it it creates a form of unity it points out that we know we
[2:39:56.880 --> 2:40:01.920]  have our rights it it starts to create a lobby for Liberty and that's what we
[2:40:01.920 --> 2:40:05.680]  have to do is get together and it also lets them know as they see these cards
[2:40:05.680 --> 2:40:10.320]  more and more that there's a solidarity obviously congressman you know that but
[2:40:10.320 --> 2:40:13.120]  I'm just pointing it out for some new listeners that are saying what's the point
[2:40:13.120 --> 2:40:18.000]  of this do you agree with me that this is probably the biggest unifying issue
[2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:23.680]  that we've seen in a decade it is I think Alex because it affects so many
[2:40:23.680 --> 2:40:28.800]  people and the measures that the TSA are taking are so intrusive and so
[2:40:28.800 --> 2:40:34.120]  arbitrary that they really touch the heart and soul of what it means to be
[2:40:34.120 --> 2:40:38.400]  an American to not have to subject yourself to the humiliation the absolute
[2:40:38.400 --> 2:40:45.200]  humiliation of having the government be able to take a a public a a nude
[2:40:45.200 --> 2:40:53.040]  photograph to you in public and to subject you at their arbitrary whim to
[2:40:53.040 --> 2:40:58.800]  an extremely invasive papton I mean these this is the this is what you know I
[2:40:58.800 --> 2:41:03.200]  learned many many years ago in law school where such such acts is by the
[2:41:03.200 --> 2:41:07.520]  government that they could that they could only use on somebody on whom they
[2:41:07.520 --> 2:41:10.480]  had clear suspicion of criminal activity and now they're they're
[2:41:10.480 --> 2:41:16.280]  substituting average law-abiding American citizens and law-abiding foreign
[2:41:16.280 --> 2:41:20.640]  visitors to this country this this form of humiliation sure I mean if you saw
[2:41:20.640 --> 2:41:23.520]  somebody run out of a liquor store after a robbery you catch them down the
[2:41:23.520 --> 2:41:26.920]  street they look like they shove a gun down their pants both your safety as a
[2:41:26.920 --> 2:41:30.360]  police officer you tackle them you get the gun but you don't just march little
[2:41:30.360 --> 2:41:33.480]  kids up and everybody's guilty until proven innocent in fact you're a lawyer
[2:41:33.480 --> 2:41:37.560]  you've been in the CIA you've been at international delegations you know you've
[2:41:37.560 --> 2:41:40.920]  you've sat on key committees in Congress so you're you're a leading expert on
[2:41:40.920 --> 2:41:44.760]  these issues so let me ask you this this is a layman I'm not a lawyer I'm not all
[2:41:44.760 --> 2:41:48.480]  these things but but just as a person who studied the common law Bill of Rights
[2:41:48.480 --> 2:41:53.480]  Constitution rebel to founding fathers wrote read a few court cases had a lot
[2:41:53.480 --> 2:41:58.040]  of lawyers on constitutional lawyers I mean if the FBI can't randomly go to a
[2:41:58.040 --> 2:42:02.440]  park and start rubbing the outside of your pants or God forbid going inside as
[2:42:02.440 --> 2:42:08.400]  they're now doing the state police can't do it so how do the feds create a
[2:42:08.400 --> 2:42:11.840]  group that aren't even sworn bonded officers there's no discussion of
[2:42:11.840 --> 2:42:15.840]  jurisdiction and now I've confirmed they're on highway searching cars they're
[2:42:15.840 --> 2:42:21.840]  in Dallas they they now have army personnel with TSA you can just search
[2:42:21.840 --> 2:42:27.360]  TSA inspector and you'll see photos online of of National Guard out at a
[2:42:27.360 --> 2:42:32.640]  you know Bay Fest in Alabama and there is there's National Guard with guys that
[2:42:32.640 --> 2:42:38.400]  say TSA inspector searching little kids bags just randomly not even going into
[2:42:38.400 --> 2:42:42.080]  a sports stadium but entering downtown I mean it's to me it's nothing but
[2:42:42.080 --> 2:42:46.520]  acclimation but how how do they do this I mean where's the 10th amendment where's
[2:42:46.520 --> 2:42:51.480]  the fourth where is the due process I mean it Texas as you know tried to pass
[2:42:51.480 --> 2:42:56.360]  a law and I want you to speak to this last year unanimously pass the house the
[2:42:56.360 --> 2:43:03.480]  feds threaten a blockade of the airways so the the Senate backs off but but how
[2:43:03.480 --> 2:43:11.840]  do they do this how are they engaging in this type of activity that is the
[2:43:11.840 --> 2:43:17.600]  fundamental question Alex you pose it over and over again and the answer to it
[2:43:17.600 --> 2:43:22.440]  is they can do this because we the American people let them do it there is
[2:43:22.440 --> 2:43:27.360]  no reasonable basis at all in the Constitution of the United States of
[2:43:27.360 --> 2:43:33.160]  America including the Bill of Rights of course for the government to subject a
[2:43:33.160 --> 2:43:39.560]  person who simply seeks to travel interstate pays their money to the
[2:43:39.560 --> 2:43:43.920]  airline and has a contract with that airline there's no basis at all for the
[2:43:43.920 --> 2:43:49.160]  government to step in and prohibit that person from traveling interstate
[2:43:49.160 --> 2:43:54.200]  pursuant to their contract with the airline simply because the government
[2:43:54.200 --> 2:43:59.120]  without any reasonable suspicion whatsoever demands that the person
[2:43:59.120 --> 2:44:05.560]  subject themselves to some themselves to an invasive virtually body cavity
[2:44:05.560 --> 2:44:08.720]  search it hasn't gotten quite to that point but that's the direction they're
[2:44:08.720 --> 2:44:16.520]  going in and when you ask as I've done sometimes ask the TSA a person what is
[2:44:16.520 --> 2:44:22.320]  the reasonable basis what do you suspect what crime do you suspect me of they
[2:44:22.320 --> 2:44:27.440]  have no idea what you're even asking them but until the American people stand
[2:44:27.440 --> 2:44:32.280]  up both individually and collectively and through our representatives at the
[2:44:32.280 --> 2:44:36.320]  state level and at the federal level they're gonna continue to get away with
[2:44:36.320 --> 2:44:41.720]  this look folks can go to liberty guard org and find out more and organize and
[2:44:41.720 --> 2:44:45.040]  get involved in your community you guys are building powerful grassroots
[2:44:45.040 --> 2:44:49.200]  organization around the Fourth Amendment around states rights around due
[2:44:49.200 --> 2:44:54.920]  process innocent until proven guilty just an amazing website with with so much
[2:44:54.920 --> 2:44:59.240]  information and people are angry and want to fight back for their liberty not
[2:44:59.240 --> 2:45:03.680]  just for now but for the future get involved at liberty guard org and
[2:45:03.680 --> 2:45:08.760]  that's my next question a what is the government thinking because you know I
[2:45:08.760 --> 2:45:12.040]  didn't like Bush and I don't like Obama but really under Obama stuff has
[2:45:12.040 --> 2:45:18.040]  gotten markedly three or four times worse not just on that front but in the
[2:45:18.040 --> 2:45:24.520]  a protest bills being passed where it's a felony I mean it's getting downright
[2:45:24.520 --> 2:45:28.960]  creepy even for somebody like myself that is just you know wildly untrusting
[2:45:28.960 --> 2:45:33.680]  of government I mean it's even starting to really overshoot what I thought they
[2:45:33.680 --> 2:45:39.880]  would do I mean I guess I'm babbling the point is what are they thinking are
[2:45:39.880 --> 2:45:44.480]  they trying to turn the whole public against them listen it's not babbling
[2:45:44.480 --> 2:45:49.080]  at all Alex you bring up very very important points that they're repeating
[2:45:49.080 --> 2:45:54.480]  over and over and over again till this thinks into a strong majority of their
[2:45:54.480 --> 2:45:59.000]  American people far too many of our fellow citizens that despite your show
[2:45:59.000 --> 2:46:03.080]  despite the work that you do in getting these ideas out there and the work that
[2:46:03.080 --> 2:46:07.280]  I do with my small way to teach the Constitution and fighting court against
[2:46:07.280 --> 2:46:11.880]  the government despite our efforts there still are way too many people out
[2:46:11.880 --> 2:46:16.680]  there who are willing to accept this intrusiveness on the part of the
[2:46:16.680 --> 2:46:21.960]  government because they believe or sent that it makes them safer of course it
[2:46:21.960 --> 2:46:27.320]  doesn't and that does not still even if it did make us safer that does not make
[2:46:27.320 --> 2:46:32.640]  it right it does not make it constitutional and you mentioned the
[2:46:32.640 --> 2:46:40.400]  the so-called Viper program VIP are that the TSA is now using to stop to stop
[2:46:40.400 --> 2:46:46.120]  trucks on interstates to go to sporting events to go to bus stations to go to
[2:46:46.120 --> 2:46:53.080]  train stations and arbitrarily start start pristine people going through their
[2:46:53.080 --> 2:46:58.640]  bags and and so forth and this administration what makes it particularly
[2:46:58.640 --> 2:47:03.920]  troubling with this administration is that this administration the Obama
[2:47:03.920 --> 2:47:09.000]  administration both as a candidate when Senator Obama was running for president
[2:47:09.000 --> 2:47:14.720]  and shortly after he was sworn in as president over three years ago he said
[2:47:14.720 --> 2:47:20.720]  explicitly many times that he was going to pay closer he did the Constitution was
[2:47:20.720 --> 2:47:26.640]  not going to you know conduct the surveillance and intrusive activities
[2:47:26.640 --> 2:47:31.280]  that Bush administration but not only has he continued them in many respects as
[2:47:31.280 --> 2:47:36.960]  you just indicated Alex he's he's accelerated them and Congress has gone
[2:47:36.960 --> 2:47:44.640]  along have you seen the video a congressman Bob Barr joining us listeners
[2:47:44.640 --> 2:47:50.760]  have you seen last Tuesday the chairman of the Joint Chiefs Panetta and the
[2:47:50.760 --> 2:47:56.840]  chairman of the Joint Chiefs Dempsey with the Secretary of Defense Panetta up
[2:47:56.840 --> 2:48:03.520]  there telling senators that we don't need to get approval for wars now from
[2:48:03.520 --> 2:48:08.680]  Congress the president gets it from the UN have you seen that I did and it's one
[2:48:08.680 --> 2:48:13.640]  of those things that at first I thought I can't be this is a joke this is like
[2:48:13.640 --> 2:48:19.360]  they the daily onion or whatever yeah newspaper is the darned if it you know
[2:48:19.360 --> 2:48:26.480]  you look at it and unfortunately as bad as this is the Genesis for this started
[2:48:26.480 --> 2:48:31.240]  under Bush one when Bush one went to the United Nations to get the United Nations
[2:48:31.240 --> 2:48:38.360]  seal of approval to to kick Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait back in 1991 it
[2:48:38.360 --> 2:48:42.760]  started under Bush one and then it continued under Clinton and continued
[2:48:42.760 --> 2:48:49.040]  under Bush two and now we've we've moved to the point where that we have an
[2:48:49.040 --> 2:48:54.880]  administration saying it is more important for us to get the approval of
[2:48:54.880 --> 2:49:02.720]  the permission of foreign governments to place our troops in combat conflict
[2:49:02.720 --> 2:49:06.320]  situations more important than it is to get the approval of the Congress the
[2:49:06.320 --> 2:49:11.960]  United States unbelievable you're right and and and right mark went with that
[2:49:11.960 --> 2:49:15.400]  quote but within that seven and a half minute tape and I went watch the raw
[2:49:15.400 --> 2:49:22.680]  footage it was even worse on C-SPAN site they the senator sessions keep saying
[2:49:22.680 --> 2:49:27.320]  look go ahead and say article one section 8 clause 11 you know it's
[2:49:27.320 --> 2:49:32.520]  Congress that's in charge right and the Secretary of Defense says we get it from
[2:49:32.520 --> 2:49:36.840]  the UN that's where the president gets it in NATO and and then the senator says
[2:49:36.840 --> 2:49:41.040]  I'm losing my breath here I can't believe and I watched the weird
[2:49:41.040 --> 2:49:44.920]  certainness of the generals behind him it was almost like a standoff as I've
[2:49:44.920 --> 2:49:48.240]  watched so many congressional hearings you've been there with those guys in
[2:49:48.240 --> 2:49:52.040]  front of you but in the past they were deferential towards Congress their
[2:49:52.040 --> 2:49:57.480]  bosses they were acting kind of like hey move over little dog you know fat dogs
[2:49:57.480 --> 2:50:06.320]  moving in I mean it I don't I certainly hope that we don't face four more years
[2:50:06.320 --> 2:50:12.600]  of this administration but even if we don't if we do have hopefully a new
[2:50:12.600 --> 2:50:19.600]  president that's sworn in January 20th of 2013 these things these problems are
[2:50:19.600 --> 2:50:25.040]  not going to change overnight because they they reflect a a very gradual but
[2:50:25.040 --> 2:50:31.240]  very substantive change in the way our government operates it's going to take a
[2:50:31.240 --> 2:50:36.280]  lot of continued work on on your part Alex on our part with Liberty Guard other
[2:50:36.280 --> 2:50:41.160]  organizations and individuals staying involved we have to turn this around
[2:50:41.160 --> 2:50:46.720]  because every time they do something like this it builds on what has gone
[2:50:46.720 --> 2:50:52.080]  before and strengthens the ability of government to simply run rock shot over
[2:50:52.080 --> 2:50:55.640]  the American people and to run rough shot over the Constitution of the United
[2:50:55.640 --> 2:51:00.960]  States I know you're a newshound and any question I've ever asked you you've
[2:51:00.960 --> 2:51:05.320]  been informed of it and been able to comment this just broke this morning I
[2:51:05.320 --> 2:51:10.160]  don't know if you've seen it yet but soldiers asked to disarm during Leon
[2:51:10.160 --> 2:51:15.000]  Panetta speech in Afghanistan the Associated Press London telegraph for
[2:51:15.000 --> 2:51:18.640]  reporting the Pentagon admits that when Panetta went and spoke to a group of
[2:51:18.640 --> 2:51:25.560]  Marines they asked that they all leave their arms in their barracks and the
[2:51:25.560 --> 2:51:30.160]  Pentagon went on to say that it was for his security have you ever heard of
[2:51:30.160 --> 2:51:33.760]  something like this now where where the Secretary of Defense is afraid to be
[2:51:33.760 --> 2:51:40.520]  around US troops with weapons no and further on that story is that you just
[2:51:40.520 --> 2:51:46.920]  referred to as the fact that part of the the US generals excuse or rationale for
[2:51:46.920 --> 2:51:51.640]  doing this as well we had we had Afghan soldiers here and we didn't want to make
[2:51:51.640 --> 2:51:54.600]  them feel that they were being discriminated against by having them
[2:51:54.600 --> 2:51:59.280]  leave their weapons and US troops wouldn't have to so in order to make
[2:51:59.280 --> 2:52:03.840]  everybody feel good and not that they were being discriminated against we
[2:52:03.840 --> 2:52:08.640]  wouldn't allow any weapons in that's the correct tyranny yeah yeah everybody's
[2:52:08.640 --> 2:52:14.200]  a slave now everybody loses their rights because that is that nanny state
[2:52:14.200 --> 2:52:22.560]  tyranny sorry go ahead no it's the same sort of approach that we see over and
[2:52:22.560 --> 2:52:26.120]  over and over again here domestically in this country they just take the gun
[2:52:26.120 --> 2:52:31.200]  issue you have people out there who commit criminal acts with firearms well
[2:52:31.200 --> 2:52:35.760]  what do we do rather than strengthening our law enforcement effort to get those
[2:52:35.760 --> 2:52:40.360]  people and bring them to justice that is the criminals who you improperly use
[2:52:40.360 --> 2:52:45.640]  firearms for commissions of crimes what we do is we inconvenience and deny
[2:52:45.640 --> 2:52:51.120]  everybody the freedom to possess a firearm when and where it they need it
[2:52:51.120 --> 2:52:54.720]  and it's the same sort of thing that we see now in the military over there with
[2:52:54.720 --> 2:53:01.920]  his incident it is twilight zone what do you make of the NDAA and Obama saying
[2:53:01.920 --> 2:53:06.200]  he was against it the detention of US citizens the disappearing the black
[2:53:06.200 --> 2:53:11.200]  bagging and then we learned he demanded it be added and he said well don't worry
[2:53:11.200 --> 2:53:14.320]  I won't sign it then he did sign it then he said but don't worry I won't
[2:53:14.320 --> 2:53:17.280]  implement it but then the head of the FBI and the Justice Department of both
[2:53:17.280 --> 2:53:21.200]  said well we might do that actually and then you've got the shipping guns into
[2:53:21.200 --> 2:53:25.760]  Mexico I mean if we know about this what I mean what else are they planning why
[2:53:25.760 --> 2:53:31.000]  do you think they're doing this the first part of your question is a very
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:35.440]  good one and that is we're as bad as it is with what we're seeing here with
[2:53:35.440 --> 2:53:41.440]  regard to the the NDAA TSA and so forth what we're seeing is the tip of the
[2:53:41.440 --> 2:53:46.960]  iceberg there is so much of this going on below the radar screen that we don't
[2:53:46.960 --> 2:53:51.000]  know about that's what's really frightening which which is another reason
[2:53:51.000 --> 2:53:54.840]  why it's so important to it address at least what we do know about because
[2:53:54.840 --> 2:53:59.000]  there's so much that they're doing in furtherance these same policies that we
[2:53:59.000 --> 2:54:04.280]  don't that we don't know about what was the second party question Alex I'm sorry
[2:54:04.280 --> 2:54:08.280]  I got off on a tangent I was asking Congressman why do you think they're
[2:54:08.280 --> 2:54:12.040]  doing this because it's only making their approval ratings drop it's actually
[2:54:12.040 --> 2:54:16.520]  waking people up it's great for my radio show but I'd rather have my radio show
[2:54:16.520 --> 2:54:22.160]  recede off into the you know while blue yonder than then then then be right
[2:54:22.160 --> 2:54:27.920]  about just a total fascist takeover but when the when the military is being told
[2:54:27.920 --> 2:54:31.240]  that they can take on citizens when we're being told we can be disappeared
[2:54:31.240 --> 2:54:36.600]  and we're seeing such deception I mean why do you think government's doing this
[2:54:36.600 --> 2:54:42.080]  well ultimately because it's all about control and you used the word early on
[2:54:42.080 --> 2:54:46.000]  and in this segment that is a very appropriate one and that is acclimation
[2:54:46.000 --> 2:54:53.000]  there acclimating people to having no privacy whatsoever as I am ran said many
[2:54:53.000 --> 2:54:58.080]  many years ago Alex as you know you've studied her as well as I have that if you
[2:54:58.080 --> 2:55:03.560]  take away a man's privacy you gain the power to control that person absolutely
[2:55:03.560 --> 2:55:10.160]  they know that if we have no sense of privacy if we expect and and and if we
[2:55:10.160 --> 2:55:14.000]  expect and give the government the power to know everything there is about us and
[2:55:14.000 --> 2:55:19.280]  to control us then we have lost freedom that's ultimately what's going on here
[2:55:19.280 --> 2:55:25.720]  they also rely on the fact that even though these issues are important to you
[2:55:25.720 --> 2:55:30.040]  and I and to a lot of Americans the fact of the matter is by the time the
[2:55:30.040 --> 2:55:34.360]  election rolls around everybody will be focused on what is the government doing
[2:55:34.360 --> 2:55:39.880]  for me for the economy and these issues traditionally do not factor directly
[2:55:39.880 --> 2:55:44.560]  in a national election unfortunately hopefully this time will be different and
[2:55:44.560 --> 2:55:49.000]  we can get people to focus on these issues when they go to the polls in
[2:55:49.000 --> 2:55:53.440]  November but normally they don't which is why the government is able to get
[2:55:53.440 --> 2:55:57.400]  away with this despite the fact that it seems to be dropping their approval
[2:55:57.400 --> 2:56:01.280]  numbers final question we appreciate your time
[2:56:01.280 --> 2:56:07.920]  congressman Bob Barr heading up Liberty Guard where do you see it ending I mean
[2:56:07.920 --> 2:56:12.240]  don't have a crystal ball but I see the momentum is shifting against the TSA
[2:56:12.240 --> 2:56:17.000]  people really are getting more and more angry but the system seems to be digging
[2:56:17.000 --> 2:56:23.360]  their spurs and I mean in your gut how do you see this ending I see some rays of
[2:56:23.360 --> 2:56:29.160]  hope to be honest with you Alex you get the message out there the Orlando
[2:56:29.160 --> 2:56:35.400]  International Airport is now moving again they are not backing down in their
[2:56:35.400 --> 2:56:39.840]  effort to get TSA out of their airport so that they can have private
[2:56:39.840 --> 2:56:46.680]  individuals private security services handle the security the security
[2:56:46.680 --> 2:56:51.960]  screenings hopefully people in the Congress keep people like John Micah
[2:56:51.960 --> 2:56:56.160]  who represents part of the Orlando area and heads the transportation committee
[2:56:56.160 --> 2:57:01.000]  in the house will back them up to some extent he's fighting the Republican
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:05.320]  leadership the Republican leadership and the Democratic leadership and in
[2:57:05.320 --> 2:57:11.800]  in the Congress also they don't like to take on these government agencies but
[2:57:11.800 --> 2:57:15.520]  there are some individual members Darrell Issa from California John Micah
[2:57:15.520 --> 2:57:18.800]  from Florida they're really spearheading that good news let me throw
[2:57:18.800 --> 2:57:22.760]  this in real quickly what about there's more than one way to skin a cat we have
[2:57:22.760 --> 2:57:26.000]  inside our trading stuff opening up against members of Congress what about
[2:57:26.000 --> 2:57:28.960]  going after Chertoff who's making money off these scanners I mean there's gonna
[2:57:28.960 --> 2:57:33.720]  be more than one way because we cut the money off of the profiteering then they
[2:57:33.720 --> 2:57:40.080]  won't want to you know radiate grandma if they would do that that would be a
[2:57:40.080 --> 2:57:45.680]  very effective way Alex but we saw it with the Defense Authorization Bill
[2:57:45.680 --> 2:57:51.920]  and the FAA all of these government agencies are getting increased budgets
[2:57:51.920 --> 2:57:55.920]  not reduced budgets and as long as Congress just talks about it and does
[2:57:55.920 --> 2:58:00.120]  not cut off the funding nothing of any substance is going to happen to reform
[2:58:00.120 --> 2:58:03.600]  these agencies and that's why they're so arrogant well just because they have the
[2:58:03.600 --> 2:58:07.200]  power doesn't mean they're not losing the info war they are losing the hearts
[2:58:07.200 --> 2:58:11.040]  and minds and they cannot continue to govern with any amount of brute force if
[2:58:11.040 --> 2:58:15.360]  they don't have that former congressman Bob Barr Liberty Guard dot org thank you
[2:58:15.360 --> 2:58:19.160]  for the time sir Alex it's always an honor thank you for having me thank you
