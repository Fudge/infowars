[00:00.000 --> 00:04.740]  Gavin McInnis is back with his all-new online network, FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:04.740 --> 00:10.200]  Gavin McInnis, Joe Biggs, Miley Unopolis, and Sof, all at FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:10.200 --> 00:29.700]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the frontlines of the InfoWare.
[00:29.700 --> 00:36.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is an emergency broadcast. It's October 7th, 2019.
[00:36.000 --> 00:43.000]  I'm Alex Jones, coming to you from the embattled InfoWare's News Centers in Austin, Texas, broadcasting and transmitting worldwide.
[00:43.000 --> 00:46.000]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.000]  I come to you from not in my normal broadcast chair.
[00:51.000 --> 01:00.000]  I come to you standing up on my feet to basically highlight the fact that this country is in such a crisis and is at such a crossroads.
[01:00.000 --> 01:12.000]  I was sitting here 10 minutes ago before we were going to go live on this Monday transmission, and I thought, how after 25 years on air do I note to people how serious the situation is?
[01:12.000 --> 01:16.000]  And I thought, well, how about you do most of the show today on your feet?
[01:16.000 --> 01:22.000]  Because that way it'll get you into the mental mode that we're not in the normal political season anymore.
[01:22.000 --> 01:30.000]  We're in a time where criminals, we're terrorists, are terrorizing the American people, holding the economy hostage, trying to cause mass shootings,
[01:30.000 --> 01:38.000]  trying to cause race war and trying to remove our duly elected president because they have hijacked the nation and have been selling it out for decades
[01:38.000 --> 01:46.000]  and have sold us out of the shy comms and others and are angry and don't want us to take back control of our country.
[01:46.000 --> 01:53.000]  These are the stories up on infowars.com and newswars.com right now.
[01:53.000 --> 02:03.000]  U.S. Marine Reserve units activated for emergency within the United States, which will, quote, come with little warning,
[02:03.000 --> 02:05.000]  cites threats to the homeland.
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  That's all quotes.
[02:07.000 --> 02:13.000]  Quote, for emergency within the United States, quote, that will come a little warning, quote, threats to the homeland.
[02:13.000 --> 02:19.000]  And I've read the Marine Corps order and I've talked to Marine Corps retired officers and others.
[02:19.000 --> 02:21.000]  This is unprecedented.
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.000]  You can read the full order at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[02:25.000 --> 02:35.000]  For those thinking it's not real, you just simply click on the infowars.com or newswars.com article and you'll be at the marinecourt.mil website.
[02:35.000 --> 02:42.000]  Google and Facebook and Twitter are trying to block it when you share this.mil link.
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.000]  Now, it's the Marines that protect the president.
[02:44.000 --> 02:47.000]  This is talking about the civil emergency and the civil authorities.
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.000]  This is unprecedented in this link.
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.000]  The order we're going to be going over here with you today.
[02:52.000 --> 02:59.000]  But there it is, manpower guidance for activation and deactivation of reserve component Marines ordered to active duty.
[02:59.000 --> 03:01.000]  ISO, defense support of civil authorities.
[03:01.000 --> 03:03.000]  That was signed four days ago.
[03:03.000 --> 03:09.000]  Got no attention until naturalnews.com and Mike Adams and infowars.com and myself put out an article.
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.000]  Yesterday, Mike Adams will be here in the third hour today.
[03:13.000 --> 03:21.000]  Now remember, we're in a climate where the president says we're in a civil war and there is a deep state coup against the election and against the people.
[03:21.000 --> 03:22.000]  That's the truth.
[03:22.000 --> 03:32.000]  Now they've had Phil Mudd, former deputy director of the CIA, who ran assassination programs, go on TV and say they're going to kill Trump and they're going to stab him and Giuliani in the back.
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.000]  We played all the clips on the Sunday show of them on the different news shows saying,
[03:36.000 --> 03:45.000]  President's too good for him. We want to put him in solitary confinement or we're going to kill him and we're going to kill his family and we're going to kill the cabinet.
[03:45.000 --> 03:54.000]  And they're talking about what prisons, Kaleeb and AOC and all of these evil demons are openly frothing at the mouth how they want to butcher this country.
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.000]  The left is trying to cause race wars.
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  It's in all of their admitted documents.
[03:59.000 --> 04:01.000]  We're going to be breaking it all down.
[04:01.000 --> 04:10.000]  To tell you, Tucker Carlson, I believe, is the best person on TV for his understanding of things, his deep grasp of things.
[04:10.000 --> 04:20.000]  And he did a piece, I guess an emergency weekend report he did, that is so powerful that we're going to air it at the start of the next segment.
[04:20.000 --> 04:27.000]  Dealing with how the deep state is holding America hostage, how they're threatening to kill people that don't submit, these are terrorists.
[04:27.000 --> 04:35.000]  In fact, please print me the definition of terrorism. It's to threaten violence or carry out violence for a political aim.
[04:35.000 --> 04:41.000]  And when you have all these people threatening to destroy the economy, threatening to cause race wars, threatening to kill the president,
[04:41.000 --> 04:47.000]  attacking all the supporters of lawsuits and threats, going to their houses, I'm here to tell you you're a damn terrorist.
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.000]  And we're going to stand against you.
[04:49.000 --> 04:58.000]  Yeah, your Joker movie hasn't triggered the mass shootings you want yet, but I went and saw it. It's a worship of anti-fund mass death.
[04:58.000 --> 05:01.000]  You're a bunch of criminals. You love killing babies, and they're already born.
[05:01.000 --> 05:06.000]  Everyone knows you're a bunch of demonic scum that thinks they've conquered us, but you haven't filth.
[05:06.000 --> 05:20.000]  Trump has called out the Marines. Stay with us.
[05:37.000 --> 05:41.000]  This is 21st century war.
[05:41.000 --> 05:48.000]  And wars need money to be prosecuted, and we're actually winning the war, but the enemy's throwing their full weight at us right now.
[05:48.000 --> 05:54.000]  That's why we need financial support. It's a total 360 win, double patriot points, 50% off, store-wide free shipping.
[05:54.000 --> 05:58.000]  It's about to end, but we're running out of a lot of these products at infowarstore.com.
[05:58.000 --> 06:04.000]  And I need you to get in there, step to the plate, get high quality products you already need, and fund the information war.
[06:04.000 --> 06:09.000]  infowarstore.com
[06:35.000 --> 06:44.000]  Huge massive developments to report to you on this October 7th, 2019, Monday broadcast. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:44.000 --> 06:51.000]  Tucker Carlson this weekend put out a report that is devastatingly accurate, total veritas.
[06:51.000 --> 06:57.000]  That's why now he is their number two enemy in media to be taken off the year only after yours truly.
[06:57.000 --> 07:03.000]  And by the way, I don't say that with pleasure. It's not good to be hunted like this, but when you're over the target, that's what happens.
[07:03.000 --> 07:06.000]  We're going to go to his incredible report here in a moment.
[07:06.000 --> 07:12.000]  But I want to explain something. I've made calls to folks I know in the military who are officers.
[07:12.000 --> 07:16.000]  I've made calls to folks that I know that are Marines who retire, who are officers.
[07:16.000 --> 07:21.000]  And they say absolutely that this is serious and unprecedented.
[07:21.000 --> 07:29.000]  U.S. Marine Reserve units activated for emergency within the United States, which will come with little warning sites, threats in the homeland.
[07:29.000 --> 07:33.000]  Now, why is that so important?
[07:33.000 --> 07:39.000]  I had dinner with a very close Trump confidant right after Trump got into office.
[07:39.000 --> 07:49.000]  And this individual had just had dinner a few days before in Mar-a-Lago, a two hour private dinner with the president.
[07:49.000 --> 07:59.000]  And Trump was very fatalistic and said, I'm not going to back down. It was pure bull that he never thought he wouldn't win.
[07:59.000 --> 08:07.000]  And he said that if they try to remove him extrajudicially, the 22nd Amendment, without doing a proper impeachment, that Trump intends to call out the Marines to, quote,
[08:07.000 --> 08:19.000]  encircle the White House. Now, I was told this almost three years ago, and I had my mouth hanging open. Then I talked to some other folks, and that is where Trump is.
[08:19.000 --> 08:25.000]  That's what Trump is prepared to do. And that's why the globalists are freaking out, because there are a bunch of criminals that have hijacked this nation.
[08:25.000 --> 08:37.000]  They're literal terrorists threatening to destroy the economy, to cause race wars, to trigger mass shootings. The studies show if we don't capitulate to their thought police,
[08:37.000 --> 08:43.000]  their attack on our children, their abortion factories, their killing babies after they're born, all they're able.
[08:43.000 --> 08:57.000]  So this shows how serious this is. Just like with Balazi Ford, they use one fake to bring forward more fakes. Now, they've got more fake whistleblowers.
[08:57.000 --> 09:07.000]  The word is it's John Bolton. So the neocon globalist deep state run by Romney is making its move with the Democrats on Trump right now.
[09:07.000 --> 09:15.000]  And this could not be a more important broadcast. I'm going to lay out all the evidence. Democrats are all over the news with their talking point of how they're going to threaten Republicans and their families,
[09:15.000 --> 09:23.000]  just like I told you last week, until they make Trump resign or they're going to grab him and put him in a straight jacket under the 22nd Amendment.
[09:23.000 --> 09:31.000]  They're foaming at the mouth with their plans right now. And talking about how they're going to install Hillary or Pelosi.
[09:31.000 --> 09:38.000]  Now they're saying Hillary will run. That's all over the news. You've got Bannon coming out saying, well, where'd you hear it first?
[09:38.000 --> 09:45.000]  She's still planning that. And that's why she's got the impeachment rigged up. First, let's go to this very important report from Tucker Carlson.
[09:45.000 --> 09:55.000]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. Looking back, January of 2017 seems like another age. So much has happened in the years since then.
[09:55.000 --> 10:03.000]  In other ways, not that much has changed at all. Donald Trump had not even taken the oath of office yet. But by the first week of the new year of 2017,
[10:03.000 --> 10:10.000]  in case you don't remember, permanent Washington had already committed to destroying his presidency. And Trump seemed to know it.
[10:10.000 --> 10:17.000]  A little after 8 p.m. on the night of January 3rd, 2017, the president-elect wrote a tweet.
[10:17.000 --> 10:25.000]  He took a veiled dig at U.S. intelligence agencies for their handling of the then newly initiated Russia investigation.
[10:25.000 --> 10:33.000]  At pretty much the same moment, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York was arriving at MSNBC's Midtown Manhattan Studios.
[10:33.000 --> 10:41.000]  He went to the set. And the anchor of the show he was on that night, Rachel Maddow, pulled up Trump's tweet on a screen, live on TV,
[10:41.000 --> 10:48.000]  and asked Chuck Schumer to comment on that tweet. Now, Schumer hadn't seen the tweet before, of course. He couldn't have known it was coming.
[10:48.000 --> 10:54.000]  For one of the most calculating politicians in Washington, it was a rare unscripted moment.
[10:54.000 --> 11:01.000]  And so for the first time in a long time, Chuck Schumer just went with the unvarnished truth. Watch what he said.
[11:01.000 --> 11:14.000]  Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community. They have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you. So even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do this.
[11:14.000 --> 11:24.000]  So Schumer went on to say he didn't know exactly what the spy agencies would do to Donald Trump as punishment for being dumb enough to criticize them in public.
[11:24.000 --> 11:35.000]  But he warned, and this is a verbatim quote, from what I am told they are very upset about how he has treated them and talked about them, end quote, very upset.
[11:35.000 --> 11:47.000]  Got it? There's no mistaking what that was. That's a threat issued on live television with grave seriousness by a politician who's been in Washington long enough to know that it's absolutely real.
[11:47.000 --> 12:01.000]  In the end, Donald Trump ignored it, or more likely he decided to defy it. Day after day, he gave the finger to the permanent Washington establishment, often on Twitter, sometimes at press conferences, but always with unmistakable relish.
[12:01.000 --> 12:08.000]  Trump acted like a man who'd won an election in a democratic country. He seemed to feel free to say exactly what he really thought.
[12:08.000 --> 12:17.000]  He didn't appear to believe that the intelligence agencies had veto power over his agenda. In a thousand different ways, the new president refused to bow.
[12:17.000 --> 12:24.000]  And for that crime, more than any other crime, he was punished, most recently by the manufactured Ukraine scandal.
[12:24.000 --> 12:36.000]  The intel world, meanwhile, has become increasingly defiant. Just yesterday, former CIA Director John Brennan expressed outrage that anyone would dare impose oversight on the intelligence agencies that secretly oversee our lives.
[12:36.000 --> 12:53.000]  I'm supposedly going to be interviewed by Mr. Dorm as part of this non-investigation. I remember William Barr, you know, when he was testifying in front of Congress, he said he didn't understand the predication of the counterintelligence investigation that was launched into Russia's interference in 2016 election.
[12:53.000 --> 13:05.000]  I don't understand the predication of this worldwide effort to try to uncover dirt, either real or imagined, that would discredit that investigation in 2016 into Russian interference.
[13:05.000 --> 13:15.000]  John Brennan is a naked partisan, and he's a liar. He's acted in ways that would have shocked and horrified previous CIA directors, and that's saying a lot.
[13:15.000 --> 13:21.000]  But John Brennan is not ashamed, far from it. He's proud, and so are his many acolytes in Washington.
[13:21.000 --> 13:36.000]  Phil Mudd is a former CIA employee, like so many partisans from intelligence world, he's now a contributor at CNN. Last night, Mudd sent an on-air warning to the president and his lawyer, back off or prepare to get hurt.
[13:36.000 --> 13:49.000]  I spent a lot of time in government. There are State Department officials who will testify, intel guys, DOD, Department of Defense people, all of us are sort of a brotherhood and sisterhood. Rudy Giuliani parachutes in from Mars.
[13:49.000 --> 14:00.000]  The people who will testify are going to look at him, including State Department officials, and say, I don't have to protect that guy. He didn't operate by the rules. He didn't do what you're supposed to do in government.
[14:00.000 --> 14:09.000]  I suspect he's worried about what the Congress will do. If I were him, I'd be worried about whether people in government stick a shiv in his back. He's in trouble.
[14:09.000 --> 14:17.000]  So it's a brotherhood, says Phil Mudd, the CIA, a brotherhood that will stab you to death if you disobey.
[14:17.000 --> 14:26.000]  What Phil Mudd is describing is not a conventional government agency. It's nothing like what most of us imagine when we think about Washington is doing on our behalf.
[14:26.000 --> 14:34.000]  The CIA of John Brennan and Phil Mudd does not exist for our benefit. It exists solely for the benefit of the people who work there.
[14:34.000 --> 14:41.000]  We pay for the whole thing, but they do what they want, and they punish anyone who criticizes them. They brag about that.
[14:41.000 --> 14:47.000]  Now that's scary, of course. It's a perversion of democracy. It's exactly what the people who created the CIA feared most.
[14:47.000 --> 14:56.000]  We're going to go to break. It comes back and gets even more powerful, and if Tucker Carlson's wanting to get fired, this is how you do it.
[14:56.000 --> 15:01.000]  I know a little bit of the inside baseball. I'm not going to talk about it on air, but let's just say Tucker's got a lot of courage doing what he's doing.
[15:01.000 --> 15:09.000]  He's going up against murdering thugs that have hijacked this nation for 70 years and think they own it and think they own you, and they're a bunch of leftists.
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  I'm going to break some things down. These CIA guys running things, they haven't killed anybody, done anything.
[15:13.000 --> 15:19.000]  They hate the military. They hate the actual killers. They hate the patriots. They hate the people that actually do the work.
[15:19.000 --> 15:25.000]  They don't even associate with them. They eat lobsters and drink fine whiskey in armored bunkers while the troops go out and fight.
[15:25.000 --> 15:34.000]  They want to act like they're the big tough guys. Let me tell you, things go sideways. These guys are all going to get wiped out by the people that are watching them very, very closely.
[15:34.000 --> 15:42.000]  That's not a threat. That's a guarantee. Fill mud, all these people. Brennan are two inches away from being forced to walk the plank
[15:42.000 --> 15:47.000]  because they're so arrogant. They're going to lose this fight. The question is, how bad is it going to get?
[15:47.000 --> 15:55.000]  We're going to lay it all out coming up on the other side. History's happening right now. This criminal group knows they're all about to go to jail, so they're making their move on Trump.
[15:55.000 --> 16:03.000]  What do we do to make sure that we're all participants in saving this country? The decision is now, ladies and gentlemen. History is now.
[16:03.000 --> 16:07.000]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com, Infowars.com. Trump's called out the Marines.

[20:23.000 --> 20:33.000]  You're listening to an infowars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[20:33.000 --> 20:39.000]  Extremism and defense of liberty is no vice.
[20:39.000 --> 20:49.000]  Welcome back on this live Monday, October 7, 2019 transmission.
[20:49.000 --> 20:59.000]  The CIA leftist arm of it has openly come out with a battle plan to shut down all conservatives and nationalists and defeat Trump in 2020.
[20:59.000 --> 21:05.000]  This is mainstream news and I'm named.
[21:05.000 --> 21:08.000]  I mean, that's the top of stacks of news I have here.
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  That's the Atlantic Council.
[21:10.000 --> 21:15.000]  They've got a new book out called information wars.
[21:15.000 --> 21:20.000]  And now I've got to be shut down and how you've got to be shut up.
[21:20.000 --> 21:26.000]  The people that presided over the cell out of the country, they were about to finish this off with race and culture war.
[21:26.000 --> 21:30.000]  But America was aware of what they've been doing and had been out there warning people.
[21:30.000 --> 21:34.000]  So when their plans were openly announced four years ago for world government.
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  And the end of free speech.
[21:36.000 --> 21:40.000]  Now Hillary was going to cause a war between the sexes.
[21:40.000 --> 21:45.000]  We had the people in place, you had the people in place and we got Trump in.
[21:45.000 --> 21:50.000]  And the same phenomenon is happening worldwide with Brexit and all the rest of it.
[21:50.000 --> 21:53.000]  A very, very exciting time to be alive.
[21:53.000 --> 21:59.000]  And here's Tucker Carlson with the number two biggest cable show in the world.
[21:59.000 --> 22:16.000]  Seeing over 160 countries laying out how people from the CIA, former deputy director, is saying they're going to kill the president, kill Giuliani.
[22:16.000 --> 22:21.000]  This is just flagrant threats to make all the intelligence agencies think, well, we better do what they say.
[22:21.000 --> 22:25.000]  They're really the legitimate government by calling everyone Russians.
[22:25.000 --> 22:34.000]  Well, guess what? The CFR, the Atlantic Council, the leftist CIA came out again in this new report and said they're going Russia gate 2.0.
[22:34.000 --> 22:42.000]  And that all of us that are from Trump are Russian agents and can even be killed.
[22:42.000 --> 22:47.000]  Oh, they're starting to talk about using kinetic action. You've seen them on the news.
[22:47.000 --> 22:54.000]  When they're saying kinetic action on the news, that's so their people hear that and think, well, we better follow orders to take out the Russians.
[22:54.000 --> 23:04.000]  I mean, they're really got their targets. They've got their little orders in hands, little death warrants for the president and everybody else.
[23:04.000 --> 23:09.000]  Good luck when you try to play that hand, son. But they're crazy enough to do it.
[23:09.000 --> 23:23.000]  That's why they're on the news saying they're going to kill the president, stabbed Giuliani in the back because they've been in power sucking off this country for 70 years and they can't believe like a record skipping that the music ain't playing no more.
[23:23.000 --> 23:29.000]  And so they think, intimidate, intimidate. Hey, your terrorism isn't working. That's the definition of terrorism.
[23:29.000 --> 23:36.000]  Threatening violence or carrying out violence, political aims. The Joker, all these movies are designed to cause mass shootings and then blame us.
[23:36.000 --> 23:44.000]  It's not going to hunt. That dog don't hunt, boy. Let's play Tucker Carlson finishing up.
[23:44.000 --> 23:58.000]  Now, remember, this is an intelligence agency. So it's fair to judge their performance against whether or not they predicted crucial events over the past 70 years.
[23:58.000 --> 24:07.000]  And again and again, they didn't. The CIA, for example, was shocked by the Korean War. It didn't predict the Soviet atomic bomb, not a small thing.
[24:07.000 --> 24:15.000]  It missed the Cuban missile crisis in the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. It spent decades trying to bring down Fidel Castro to kill Fidel Castro.
[24:15.000 --> 24:18.000]  So naturally, his regime never fell.
[24:18.000 --> 24:24.000]  I'll hit pause real quick and back that up 15 seconds, please.
[24:24.000 --> 24:34.000]  They didn't predict Trump getting elected and they didn't predict info wars like we predicted it all because we bet on humanity. We believed in you because I believe in myself.
[24:34.000 --> 24:47.000]  You're a red-blooded American just like me. I know a lot of great Americans, every race, color, and creed. We're not stupid. We're not getting pushed around. We've been asleep. We're awake now. Back to Tucker.
[24:47.000 --> 24:57.000]  The CIA, for example, was shocked by the Korean War. It didn't predict the Soviet atomic bomb, not a small thing. It missed the Cuban missile crisis in the 1973 Arab-Israeli War.
[24:57.000 --> 25:02.000]  It spent decades trying to bring down Fidel Castro to kill Fidel Castro.
[25:02.000 --> 25:11.000]  So naturally, his regime never fell. Castro lived into his 90s. We know the CIA spent decades propping up the Shah of Iran so naturally he tumbled from power.
[25:11.000 --> 25:15.000]  They didn't even provide a warning before that happened because they had no idea it was going to happen.
[25:15.000 --> 25:25.000]  When the Iron Curtain finally fell in 1989, the CIA was completely blindsided by it. They thought they had just predicted, in fact, the Soviet Union was as strong as ever.
[25:25.000 --> 25:32.000]  And things didn't get better after that. The CIA had no idea that Saddam Hussein planned to invade Kuwait the next year in 1990.
[25:32.000 --> 25:41.000]  They were totally surprised by India's atomic bomb test eight years later. By 2003, they were totally confident that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  In fact, their biggest success in the past 50 years may have been creating the Taliban.
[25:46.000 --> 25:56.000]  If John Brennan had been working for a non-profit business, there would have been a shareholder revolt a long time ago and probably criminal charges. He would have been John DeLorean.
[25:56.000 --> 26:04.000]  But because it's a secretive government agency, the CIA has not been restrained. In fact, it's only become more powerful and more autonomous.
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  Powerful enough to take down a president? We'll see.
[26:08.000 --> 26:18.000]  One reason that permanent Washington is so powerful, of course, so resistant to change or oversight, is that it makes alliances with some of the least impressive but most ambitious members of Congress.
[26:18.000 --> 26:26.000]  Just days ago, for example, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff claimed his office had no contact whatsoever with the CIA whistleblower.
[26:26.000 --> 26:31.000]  First off, have you heard from the whistleblower? Do you want to hear from the whistleblower?
[26:31.000 --> 26:36.000]  We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower. We would like to.
[26:36.000 --> 26:42.000]  Schiff also claims to know nothing about what was in the whistleblower's complaint before it came out.
[26:42.000 --> 26:51.000]  But yesterday, the New York Times revealed that both those claims were lies. Schiff apologized in a way, saying that he, quote, should have been much more clear.
[26:51.000 --> 26:57.000]  Right. Schiff now admits his office spoke to the whistleblower, who by the way, we learned tonight, is a registered Democrat.
[26:57.000 --> 27:06.000]  But insists his office did nothing to shape the complaint itself. But why would we believe that at this stage?
[27:06.000 --> 27:15.000]  Tucker has hit on the heart of the matter that I'll discuss when we come back after a break, but there's really seven CIA's at least.
[27:15.000 --> 27:36.000]  But the dominant one that runs things is a bunch of a feat, pipe-smoking, wine-drinking wimps, who couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag, and who loathe the military, and who loathe farmers, and who loathe black people, and who loathe people that they see as beneath them.
[27:36.000 --> 27:49.000]  There are a bunch of white shoe-boy, frat boys who are in the elitist club and all go around kissing each other's asses. And that's why all they can do is preside over, sell them the country out.
[27:49.000 --> 27:55.000]  And the world's sick of them, America's sick of them, the military's sick of them. And look, you've already lost, okay?
[27:55.000 --> 28:00.000]  I don't sit here to make claims like you do, just to have confidence. We have kicked your ass.
[28:00.000 --> 28:07.000]  And so let me give you some more predictions when we come back, white shoe-boys, about what's going to happen to you. And I may not be alive at the end of it.
[28:07.000 --> 28:16.000]  A lot of us won't be if they want to go down this road. But let me tell you, they're going to get their asses handed to them. They need to surrender right now and get out of the way.
[28:16.000 --> 28:27.000]  Why not vindictive? They all just run off. They're stolen money. They'd be left alone. But with them, it's existential. They need to dominate us to ever feel like they're real men.
[28:27.000 --> 28:33.000]  That's their quest. They hate America. They always did. They hate the real strength of the country.
[28:33.000 --> 28:37.000]  We're going to go to break. We'll be right back on the other side. Please don't forget.
[28:37.000 --> 28:43.000]  We're only here because you support us and spread the word. Band-doc videos exploding and the amount of views and support it's getting.
[28:43.000 --> 28:49.000]  A lot of great stuff's happening at newswars.com and infowars.com. And I was going to have to end the big mega sale.
[28:49.000 --> 29:06.000]  You notice I barely plugged Friday. Didn't plug any extra on the Sunday show. I've been so busy on breaking news. So I don't have new specials yet. So for today or tomorrow max, the big giant mega sale, free shipping store wide, 50% off, double-patriot points are still running for 48 hours maximum.
[29:19.000 --> 29:31.000]  A few weeks and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong. Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[29:31.000 --> 29:35.000]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:35.000 --> 29:42.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:42.000 --> 29:50.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[30:44.000 --> 30:52.000]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[30:52.000 --> 31:09.000]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below. On your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want, be sure and share band.video.
[31:09.000 --> 31:16.000]  I'm up here with the crew. It's late at night, but I can't leave the office because history is happening right now.
[31:16.000 --> 31:25.000]  This is a battle of wills between those that want a free world and those that want tyranny. Those who've bet against humanity and those who've bet on humanity.
[31:25.000 --> 31:34.000]  So I am so thankful to you, the listeners. You are the salt of the earth. You are the people that understand what's happening and who have helped launch a worldwide revolution against tyranny.

[32:08.000 --> 32:17.000]  Silicon Valley thinks you're a dumb jellyfish. They think the West is dead. They think if they censor nationalist and patriots off the Internet, you'll just forget about us.
[32:17.000 --> 32:21.000]  And then they'll be the only information out there. Well, so far, that's not been working too well for them.
[32:21.000 --> 32:28.000]  Thanks to you spreading the word steadfastly that the resistance to globalism is alive and well at band.video.

[33:04.000 --> 33:16.000]  And it's up to you to unleash its full potential band.video.
[33:35.000 --> 33:42.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:42.000 --> 33:53.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:53.000 --> 33:59.000]  We are living in historic times and it's critical to understand that when you study history,
[33:59.000 --> 34:09.000]  most of the time before a giant world war starts or a cascade of wars or economic collapse or just major earth wrecking changes,
[34:09.000 --> 34:21.000]  people don't realize they're in the crisis until they're already deep into it or sometimes until it's already run over them like an out of control locomotive.
[34:21.000 --> 34:29.000]  So I don't want to just sit here as a spectator while the globalists rule over us. I want to be involved. I want to be a history's actor.
[34:29.000 --> 34:42.000]  Remember Carl Rove famously like 15 years ago during the first Bush term of W was that a cocktail party of the Washington Post and New York Times and others.
[34:42.000 --> 34:47.000]  And they're like, hey, the WMDs weren't there. I mean, you got proven to be a liar and you made it up and he goes, doesn't matter.
[34:47.000 --> 34:56.000]  I control reality. I'm history's actor and you will dutifully report whatever new reality I tell you, whether you know two plus two equals 10 or two plus two equals five.
[34:56.000 --> 34:59.000]  Whatever I tell you, you'll do.
[34:59.000 --> 35:05.000]  And then at the same cocktail party, Richard Pearl was there and he was walking up to women going.
[35:05.000 --> 35:11.000]  He later basically admitted this going, you know, I'm powerful. I've killed millions.
[35:11.000 --> 35:22.000]  They just go big fat guy probably couldn't even walk up a flight of stairs. You know, I kill a lot of people like Obama.
[35:22.000 --> 35:28.000]  I'm really good at killing people with predator drones.
[35:28.000 --> 35:33.000]  I know a lot of people that have killed hundreds of people a piece and they're not really proud of it.
[35:33.000 --> 35:37.000]  They did it because they thought it was right. They were ordered to but they certainly don't talk about it a lot.
[35:37.000 --> 35:40.000]  They certainly don't brag about it. That's not good luck.
[35:40.000 --> 35:47.000]  But all these guys that never even gotten a fist fight. Oh, they're going to kill Trump. Oh, they're going to get me.
[35:47.000 --> 35:53.000]  Oh, they're going to stab Giuliani in the back.
[35:53.000 --> 35:56.000]  Make a mistake you ever made.
[35:56.000 --> 36:00.000]  But you're going to make it, aren't you? I know you are.
[36:00.000 --> 36:05.000]  One way or another, losers always blow their feet off, don't they?
[36:05.000 --> 36:10.000]  Well, I'm going to do my best to walk through the huge giant news.
[36:10.000 --> 36:14.000]  And then we're going to open the phones up at the start of the next hour and I'm going to be very dutiful.
[36:14.000 --> 36:19.000]  I'm going to go to a lot of you and just please say dead-os they do on rush. No need to thank me.
[36:19.000 --> 36:22.000]  I love you. You love me. We're a happy family as Barron says.
[36:22.000 --> 36:27.000]  But I'm going to put people to the front of the line that disagree.
[36:27.000 --> 36:31.000]  You can disagree with me, Trump. I mean, we're not a cult here.
[36:31.000 --> 36:37.000]  I love to hear if you think Trump needs to be impeached or you really think we did was wrong.
[36:37.000 --> 36:40.000]  You'll have a chance to get on air as well.
[36:40.000 --> 36:45.000]  In fact, if you'd like to start lining up folks that disagree up front,
[36:45.000 --> 36:50.000]  I want to give people only the disagree to give a chance to call in at first and others can call in.
[36:50.000 --> 36:54.000]  You know, after we get some of those folks on the board, I know you're out there.
[36:54.000 --> 37:04.000]  877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539. Just please make your point and I'll try to respond to it.
[37:04.000 --> 37:09.000]  But I want to get you on 877-789-2539.
[37:09.000 --> 37:13.000]  Tell me Trump deserves to be impeached.
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.000]  Explain to me how he's done things that are bad, but all the deep states have not done anything at all.
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.000]  Or maybe you just don't care. You just don't like Trump. Tell me.
[37:21.000 --> 37:27.000]  Again, the toll free number is 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[37:27.000 --> 37:33.000]  And then after that, anybody that called in and didn't get on air yesterday, you're welcome up front as well after those folks.
[37:33.000 --> 37:39.000]  Then it'll just be general open phones. Please don't try to call if you agree or you're not somebody that disagrees until we start the next hour.
[37:39.000 --> 37:44.000]  The phones are only open right now. If people disagree, 877-789-2539.
[37:44.000 --> 37:47.000]  And then as soon as the next hour starts, I'll go to your calls.
[37:47.000 --> 37:54.000]  Now, let me announce the big enchilada, then we'll get into it in even more detail than yesterday.
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  And I have more information now.
[37:56.000 --> 38:08.000]  Four days ago, the Marine General that is actively in charge of the Marine Corps and their operations
[38:08.000 --> 38:14.000]  put a directive out from the Commander-in-Chief that the Marines are now directly under the President's command,
[38:14.000 --> 38:20.000]  which is his purview as Commander-in-Chief in wartime and that they're ready to act domestically
[38:20.000 --> 38:25.000]  for an emergency within the United States to stop illegal coup.
[38:25.000 --> 38:29.000]  We're going to walk over all of that and how historic this is and how big that is.
[38:29.000 --> 38:30.000]  Here's the actual quotes.
[38:30.000 --> 38:35.000]  The U.S. Marine Reserve units activated for emergency for the United States, which will come with little warning.
[38:35.000 --> 38:38.000]  Sites threats to the homeland. Those are quotes.
[38:38.000 --> 38:44.000]  Against the Marines that protect the President, specifically, and are directly under his command,
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  and that guard the White House and all the rest of it.
[38:46.000 --> 38:51.000]  And it was Marines that were called out to stop the coup against Roosevelt.
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  And the McCormick-Dickstein Committee exposed all that.
[38:53.000 --> 38:58.000]  There were quieter rest of thousands when that happened on the eve of World War II.
[38:58.000 --> 39:05.000]  It actually came to Smedley Butler to lead the Nazi takeover, working with George W. Bush's grandfather,
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.000]  Prescott Bush.
[39:09.000 --> 39:12.000]  But Prescott was too big to fail.
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.000]  He agreed to double-cross the Nazis at the end and transfer the money into U.S.
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  Manga Council. He was allowed to operate.
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.000]  But everybody else either got cement shoes or went to prison.
[39:22.000 --> 39:23.000]  But it was so embarrassing.
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  It was kept quiet till the end of World War II.
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  Then they had hearings to flush out all the things that went on.
[39:27.000 --> 39:31.000]  My film, Endgame, Blue River Global Enslavedment starts with congressional hearing clips.
[39:31.000 --> 39:32.000]  There's actually that happening.
[39:32.000 --> 39:39.000]  So we've been through this before actually quite a few times.
[39:39.000 --> 39:47.000]  And it was the Marines that were quietly called out to go kill the operatives in the United States quietly.
[39:47.000 --> 39:54.000]  So you better believe this is a very serious bridge to be crossing.
[39:54.000 --> 39:58.000]  And Hillary has this psychotic, fake confidence.
[39:58.000 --> 40:03.000]  She's still in command of the Democrats to a great extent, and that she believes she's invincible.
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  All because his other globalists died over the years.
[40:05.000 --> 40:10.000]  She was given a lot of the reins of power, kind of inherited it.
[40:10.000 --> 40:12.000]  And she's holding on, but she intends to run.
[40:12.000 --> 40:17.000]  And I told you this three years ago, two years ago, a year ago, six months ago, a month ago.
[40:17.000 --> 40:26.000]  Now, could Clinton's, could Trump's impeachment crisis push Hillary Clinton to run in 2020?
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.000]  She banned and predicts Hillary will run 2020.
[40:29.000 --> 40:32.000]  And we've got the reports for you all showing the evidence that she's already running.
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  She just hasn't announced it.
[40:34.000 --> 40:41.000]  It's one of the featured videos at banned.video, breaking Hillary Clinton runs for president 2020.
[40:41.000 --> 40:42.000]  That's all coming up as well.
[40:42.000 --> 40:48.000]  Meanwhile, Joe Biden donors gather for emergency closed door meeting as campaign loses steam.
[40:48.000 --> 40:52.000]  Three other candidates are raising more money than he is.
[40:52.000 --> 40:57.000]  I told you four months ago, he'd obviously had another stroke and would end up having to drop out.
[40:57.000 --> 41:02.000]  Now it's all over the news that he could drop out any day.
[41:02.000 --> 41:07.000]  I told you that I talked to security services that were in the room when he was cussing saying,
[41:07.000 --> 41:14.000]  why the hell do I do this auto just drop out tomorrow's news today.
[41:14.000 --> 41:17.000]  So we'll be looking at every angle of that.
[41:17.000 --> 41:25.000]  Please don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, that in this crisis, we're winning, but just barely.
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.000]  And your word of mouth, you're telling people about banned.video.
[41:28.000 --> 41:33.000]  You're emailing and text messaging and sending out articles and videos is beyond paramount.
[41:33.000 --> 41:36.000]  Your word of mouth is king in this war.
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  And please don't forget your financial support.
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  Without it, we will be shut down.
[41:40.000 --> 41:45.000]  We have been in the red this year operating just in the red.
[41:45.000 --> 41:48.000]  And then going in and out of black into the red.
[41:48.000 --> 41:52.000]  And I still just am expanding spending some backup reserves I saved.
[41:52.000 --> 42:00.000]  I don't like doing that, but gut level tells me just press the accelerator all the way down and that we're going to get to the next point going into 2020.
[42:00.000 --> 42:01.000]  They've hit us with a lot.
[42:01.000 --> 42:02.000]  I'm not complaining.
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.000]  It goes with the territory, but your financial support makes it all possible.
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  Since the impeachment and the martial law and all this came up, we're seeing a lot more orders.
[42:10.000 --> 42:11.000]  That's good.
[42:11.000 --> 42:26.000]  But at 50% off all the products, store-wide free shipping and double patriot points, some of these items like the high quality silver wound gel, skin cream with a hyaluronic acid and all the vitamins.
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.000]  I mean, that is a first rate product at 50% off.
[42:29.000 --> 42:30.000]  I just get so busy.
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  I said all the stuff, most 50% off.
[42:32.000 --> 42:35.000]  Well, that's not really a supplement, folks.
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  That's at cost, actually.
[42:37.000 --> 42:41.000]  In fact, with the free shipping, we lose money on it, but I'm leaving it up.
[42:41.000 --> 42:42.000]  We have small tubes and big tubes.
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  It's incredible for men, women, you name it.
[42:44.000 --> 42:45.000]  It's not just for your skin health.
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  It's for defending your body against viruses and bacteria.
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  It's something you can put on beforehand.
[42:49.000 --> 42:50.000]  It's amazing.
[42:50.000 --> 42:59.000]  And there's just so many other products, the toothpaste, the great coffee, the wonderful, super strong turmeric bodies, ultimate turmeric formula.
[42:59.000 --> 43:00.000]  It's all at infowarsstore.com.
[43:00.000 --> 43:03.000]  We have to extend this a couple more days because I've been so busy.
[43:03.000 --> 43:04.000]  I haven't come to the new special yet.
[43:04.000 --> 43:06.000]  It's our biggest special since Christmas.
[43:06.000 --> 43:08.000]  Take advantage of it.
[43:08.000 --> 43:12.000]  My friends, I've seen a lot of Donald Trump just like you have.
[43:12.000 --> 43:25.000]  And my goodness, yesterday's press conference, when they came in on him with all their garbage, the foreign reporters, the U.S. reporters, these little political sellouts, these whores, he just tore them to bits.
[43:25.000 --> 43:27.000]  And it's one thing to hear it if you're a radio listener.
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.000]  It's powerful, but if you see it, it's all at band.video.
[43:31.000 --> 43:36.000]  You've got the full press conference, we've got mine boiled down of how epic it is.
[43:36.000 --> 43:37.000]  It's all at band.video.
[43:37.000 --> 43:42.000]  And I just, you've got to share this with people because Trump was hitting on all 45 cylinders.
[43:42.000 --> 43:43.000]  This was amazing.
[43:43.000 --> 43:45.000]  And he turned the nitrous oxide on top of it.
[43:45.000 --> 43:49.000]  So infowars, America, Trump, all of us, incredible things are happening.
[43:49.000 --> 43:55.000]  And we're sharing the ideas that are going to defeat the tyrants at band.video.
[43:55.000 --> 44:01.000]  And I got to tell you, we've done great video work, we've done great films, we've done so much, but websites are not our thing.
[44:01.000 --> 44:02.000]  Well, now they are.
[44:02.000 --> 44:04.000]  I'm so proud of band.video, folks.
[44:04.000 --> 44:05.000]  Check it out.
[44:05.000 --> 44:33.000]  There's a lot of new features at band.video.
[44:33.000 --> 45:02.000]  Thanks for watching.
[45:03.000 --> 45:16.000]  You have all the power in the world, but you must use it.
[45:16.000 --> 45:18.000]  You must take action.
[45:18.000 --> 45:21.000]  As of taping this, it's Wednesday afternoon.
[45:21.000 --> 45:25.000]  We're running the biggest sale we've had since last Christmas.
[45:25.000 --> 45:34.000]  It's store-wide free shipping, 50% off the high quality supplements for infowars life, and all the preparedness items like water filtration, air filtration,
[45:34.000 --> 45:37.000]  storeable foods, shortwave radios, and so much more.
[45:37.000 --> 45:39.000]  This is a huge special.
[45:39.000 --> 45:41.000]  We just sell a lot of product to fund ourselves.
[45:41.000 --> 45:46.000]  And these sales are a great way for you to get great prices, but also support the infowar.
[45:46.000 --> 45:47.000]  Please take action today.
[45:47.000 --> 45:53.000]  I've got to end this sale by Sunday or Monday at the max because a bunch of the items are about to sell out.
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.000]  Again, too many deals to fit them all in here.
[45:56.000 --> 46:01.000]  Just please go to infowarsstore.com and realize you're in this critical time with the globalists trying to take us off the air.
[46:01.000 --> 46:03.000]  Your support is absolutely essential.
[46:03.000 --> 46:05.000]  So thank you.
[46:05.000 --> 46:09.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[46:09.000 --> 46:13.000]  The truth is President Trump is the most investigated president in history.
[46:13.000 --> 46:17.000]  He is working for American interests steadfastly.
[46:17.000 --> 46:23.000]  He is trying to preserve our country as the globalists try to break our borders, bankrupt, and devalue our dollar
[46:23.000 --> 46:29.000]  and sign us over to communist Chinese control who now own Hollywood and the majority of our debt.
[46:29.000 --> 46:32.000]  We have been maneuvered towards collapse and bankruptcy.
[46:32.000 --> 46:37.000]  But at the 11th hour, 58th minute, the American people put a populist in power.
[46:37.000 --> 46:39.000]  And it's happening all over the world.
[46:39.000 --> 46:43.000]  So great things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[46:43.000 --> 46:46.000]  You're very serious with this impeachment plan.
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.000]  It has bipartisan support.
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  And I'm telling you, President Trump needs our prayers.
[46:50.000 --> 46:53.000]  And Infowars needs your prayers and support.
[46:53.000 --> 46:56.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are trying to shut us down.
[46:56.000 --> 47:00.000]  But right now it's easier than ever to financially support us while getting great products at the same time.
[47:00.000 --> 47:19.000]  With Black Friday comes two months early with store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points, and, ladies and gentlemen, 50% off.
[47:31.000 --> 47:39.000]  I got to tell you, it feels good to be standing up, not just for my country, but for what's right.
[47:39.000 --> 47:45.000]  And you grow up hearing your parents talk about this relative of the Revolutionary War, that relative,
[47:45.000 --> 47:51.000]  meeting at the Hermitage in Tennessee with President Jackson and engineering the plan,
[47:51.000 --> 47:55.000]  who invade Texas for a takeover.
[47:55.000 --> 47:57.000]  But they planned to launch 10 years later.
[47:57.000 --> 48:02.000]  It was all premeditated. And you hear all this, and then later you read the history books and it's true.
[48:02.000 --> 48:05.000]  You think, man, how am I going to measure up?
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.000]  And then I never even intended to try to measure up to any of that.
[48:08.000 --> 48:12.000]  And here we are, living it again, ladies and gentlemen.
[48:12.000 --> 48:19.000]  And we're blessed enough to have a real president who will take on these people and challenge them to their face
[48:19.000 --> 48:24.000]  and defiantly not bow to their evil threats and their corruption.
[48:24.000 --> 48:28.000]  But they're going to try to take the president out. It's such an incredible time to be alive.
[48:28.000 --> 48:31.000]  So let me get to this stack of news.
[48:31.000 --> 48:38.000]  And I don't want to incorporate myself into a story for no reason, but I'm in the story.
[48:38.000 --> 48:43.000]  And so I have to incorporate myself, or I'd be lying to you.
[48:43.000 --> 48:47.000]  But if you look at what they're scared of, this is it.
[48:47.000 --> 48:53.000]  Independent, a support base that knows what's going on, that can't be bullied or driven off,
[48:53.000 --> 48:56.000]  and people that are focused and taking action.
[48:56.000 --> 48:59.000]  That's why the president has more support than ever.
[48:59.000 --> 49:06.000]  Even in their fake polls, he's three, four, five points ahead of where Obama was three years into his first term.
[49:06.000 --> 49:11.000]  That's why they're so scared.
[49:11.000 --> 49:16.000]  They're scared of you. They're scared of you knowing you're winning.
[49:16.000 --> 49:20.000]  So this article is up on infowars.com. It's a Steve Watson article.
[49:20.000 --> 49:28.000]  Hillary is making the rounds, saying Trump needs to be impeached again because the Russians got a man,
[49:28.000 --> 49:35.000]  and they're going to try to steal this next election, no evidence, all I.
[49:35.000 --> 49:40.000]  And that they need to use the powers they have to counter the Russian operatives.
[49:40.000 --> 49:45.000]  Then you read the groups they've got involved and how they say they're going to counter it.
[49:45.000 --> 49:53.000]  It's thousands of former Obama and Clinton and Bush appointees, but mainly liberals, leftists,
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.000]  who got those billions that Obama put in when he left office in the stay-behind network,
[49:57.000 --> 50:05.000]  the rebuilding America's defenses, you know, part 2.0, countering foreign disinformation propaganda act.
[50:05.000 --> 50:11.000]  Sounds like it's a good thing. No, it's countering patriots fighting the chai-com sell-out.
[50:11.000 --> 50:16.000]  And so Hillary's out there rebooting it and putting out Atlantic Council talking points.
[50:16.000 --> 50:26.000]  And that's, again, the private intelligence agencies that transferred the power out of the U.S. agencies to themselves,
[50:26.000 --> 50:34.000]  who still have security clearances operating the shadow-row government that's openly interfacing with the corporate lying media
[50:34.000 --> 50:44.000]  to try to drum up race war division, economic collapse, and the overthrow of the president because he is a populist nationalist candidate.
[50:44.000 --> 50:52.000]  So the destruction of your will, making themselves the permanent state openly.
[50:52.000 --> 50:58.000]  So Hillary comes out in this speech, she's given a bunch of these speeches,
[50:58.000 --> 51:01.000]  and she talks about the case for impeachment with the fake Russia.
[51:01.000 --> 51:06.000]  Now, you said that doesn't make any sense. That's been disproven. That's how they get the funding.
[51:06.000 --> 51:12.000]  That's how they tell their people, hey, we're not overthrowing an election. We're overthrowing a foreign Russian takeover.
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.000]  When they're the globalists, actually overthrowing the country.
[51:15.000 --> 51:21.000]  And now having that overthrow taken away from them at the 11th hour, 58th minute.
[51:21.000 --> 51:32.000]  So here's Hillary cites Russian conspiracy theory at George Washington University over the weekend. Here's what she said.
[51:32.000 --> 51:39.000]  All bets are off. If foreign governments think they can tilt the playing field as they did against me,
[51:39.000 --> 51:47.000]  which was a deliberate, well-planned effort laid out in indictments against Russian military...
[51:47.000 --> 51:51.000]  Then pause. Back it up 10 seconds.
[51:51.000 --> 51:59.000]  Layed out in these indictments of 13 Internet bots from the Internet Research Group.
[51:59.000 --> 52:06.000]  That's really a CIA, triple agent front group in DC.
[52:06.000 --> 52:10.000]  And then the people showed up in court who run the company saying, we're here.
[52:10.000 --> 52:14.000]  And so now Mueller doesn't know what to do.
[52:14.000 --> 52:18.000]  It's come out in court that they have no evidence and it's all made up and that there's just Internet companies in Russia
[52:18.000 --> 52:22.000]  you can hire that'll do any advertising you want and go around spam laws.
[52:22.000 --> 52:27.000]  And 80% of all the advertising done in 2016 was done for Hillary.
[52:27.000 --> 52:30.000]  Isn't that funny? 80% of the money in the campaign was given to Hillary
[52:30.000 --> 52:35.000]  and exactly 80% of spending in Russia was for Hillary.
[52:35.000 --> 52:42.000]  They're just like anybody else. You can go hire British bots, Mexican bots, Canadian bots.
[52:42.000 --> 52:45.000]  You go hire somebody outside your country to break your election rules.
[52:45.000 --> 52:51.000]  That's what Hillary did. She hired a bunch of firms and the PACs hired them.
[52:51.000 --> 52:57.000]  You can hire Russian firms to spam millions of people's email if you want with your URL.
[52:57.000 --> 53:03.000]  But again, she's saying Russians again to turn the apparatus of state loose on the American people
[53:03.000 --> 53:07.000]  and on Trump saying he's a traitor. Let's continue.
[53:07.000 --> 53:16.000]  Military actors and their allies, well, you know, the Republicans seem to think that, okay,
[53:16.000 --> 53:19.000]  so far Russia's playing on the red team.
[53:19.000 --> 53:22.000]  You're supposed to stop this again. Start it over. I'm sorry.
[53:22.000 --> 53:24.000]  Do you understand the magnitude of this?
[53:24.000 --> 53:29.000]  She's just saying, oh, we have foreign military actors and their allies.
[53:29.000 --> 53:33.000]  And so those allies can be killed. That's what mud and others are saying on TV.
[53:33.000 --> 53:39.000]  They're just saying this when she's the globalist that sold us out to China and Russia and anybody else that would pay.
[53:39.000 --> 53:47.000]  She's not a Russian agent or a Chinese agent. She's a pimp that sells us out. She's an enemy.
[53:47.000 --> 53:51.000]  And then you get into the Senate reports of these articles I've got. They named me as a Russian agent.
[53:51.000 --> 53:54.000]  I don't get a day in court. I don't get to face anybody.
[53:54.000 --> 53:59.000]  The people funding me are the American people buying our products and she damn well knows that.
[53:59.000 --> 54:03.000]  Let's see. That's how they turned all this loose on us. Continue.
[54:03.000 --> 54:15.000]  Military actors and their allies, well, you know, the Republicans seem to think that, okay, so far Russia's playing on the red team.
[54:15.000 --> 54:18.000]  And, you know, so we like it. We're not going to stand up against it.
[54:18.000 --> 54:24.000]  Well, who's to say that next week they're going to be playing on the blue team? It's crazy, my friends.
[54:24.000 --> 54:25.000]  They were always on the team.
[54:25.000 --> 54:43.000]  Impeachment is the appropriate remedy and it is such a serious assault on our democracy that is apparently asked for, aided and abetted by not only the president, but his allies who seem not to even care.
[54:43.000 --> 54:55.000]  She just lied and said the whole thing is Russia got Trump in when none of that's true. Just like Balazi Ford's, it's all lies. I can't listen to it anymore.
[54:55.000 --> 54:58.000]  Then she goes into how his allies have to pay. We've got to go after them, not just Trump.
[54:58.000 --> 55:05.000]  It's more of the same bullying. Hey, listen, lady, all that does is piss everybody off and it makes the American people angry.
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.000]  Now let's move on. This all ties together.
[55:09.000 --> 55:14.000]  Backfire, NBA, Houston Rockets, coward to communist China, get blasted online.
[55:14.000 --> 55:19.000]  Later we'll play the video from the team owner, all of its pathetic.
[55:19.000 --> 55:25.000]  Their manager said that he stands in solidarity with Hong Kong and their wish to not be extradited to China.
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  They're getting rid of all their freedoms. China's taking them over.
[55:27.000 --> 55:30.000]  Even though they have a treaty saying they can't.
[55:30.000 --> 55:34.000]  There was a backlash by the Chinese government and, quote, Chinese businesses in the U.S.
[55:34.000 --> 55:37.000]  That means Chinese government front companies.
[55:37.000 --> 55:43.000]  So he came out and apologized. The team owner came out and apologized and said that basically the Hong Kong people are horrible.
[55:43.000 --> 55:48.000]  Now there's even bigger backlash from Ted Cruz and others, and they're rightfully should be.
[55:48.000 --> 55:54.000]  This is the political correctness now where team managers can't even say they support Hong Kong.
[55:54.000 --> 55:59.000]  That's pathetic. That's the censorship. That's the gelding in this country.
[55:59.000 --> 56:06.000]  You give away all your rights. You give away all your liberties. You bow to everybody and pretty soon you are a nobody.
[56:06.000 --> 56:19.000]  There's no Chinese saying that if a man is wood and basically piles himself down for other people's tastes, pretty soon he won't exist.
[56:19.000 --> 56:23.000]  And that's a butchering of it out of the Mandarin. But I read it years ago.
[56:23.000 --> 56:28.000]  And that's it. You give a little bit of yourself up every time. Pretty soon you don't know who you are.
[56:28.000 --> 56:32.000]  And you have no power to even live your own life.
[56:32.000 --> 56:39.000]  Because it's all ties together. Concentration camp survivors. China using forced sterilization. Abortion for genocide.
[56:39.000 --> 56:45.000]  Hong Kong government considering internet ban to stop protest. Just not letting anybody have social media.
[56:45.000 --> 56:50.000]  That's where all this is going is incrementally just no social media or interaction to begin with.
[56:50.000 --> 56:56.000]  I've got a special report I'm filing later to Joe Rogan on this subject. It's a very powerful thing of the show.
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.000]  Now that ties into this piece I was mentioning.
[56:59.000 --> 57:09.000]  Caibe censorship does not end well. Rolling Stone goes on to say the Atlantic Council run by the CIA and the left in Congress is targeting Alex Jones to shut him down.
[57:09.000 --> 57:14.000]  That's the article. I wanted to show you that because here it is.
[57:14.000 --> 57:22.000]  The Atlantic Council has now published information wars, information wars, how we lost the global battle against disinformation and what we can do about it.
[57:22.000 --> 57:30.000]  It goes into talking about shutting me down, shutting all conservatives down by saying we're Russian agents and how operatives in the government can do this.
[57:30.000 --> 57:34.000]  Information wars. A conversation with Richard Stingle.
[57:34.000 --> 57:41.000]  Atlantic Council. That's the Spooks doing what Hillary said. Name us all as Russians and ban us having any speech bank accounts.
[57:41.000 --> 57:45.000]  They go on to say the NRA are Russian agents. I'm not kidding.
[57:45.000 --> 57:58.000]  Oh yeah, there's headlines that the Russian Putin runs the NRA. I'm not joking. They're coming after everything. They're coming after you by naming all Americans enemy spies when they're the enemy globalist.
[57:58.000 --> 58:04.000]  Globalism was doomed to fail if we just exposed it and then resisted it.
[58:04.000 --> 58:19.000]  Didn't I say a thousand times that there's no way you're going to have an authoritarian corporate world government above the law that doesn't pay taxes, that has diplomatic immunity, that runs around saying it's communist and socialist power to the people, but then meanwhile is tax exempt again offshore.
[58:19.000 --> 58:31.000]  Well, Trump got that and all these other populace get it. Why would you throw away wealthy, successful countries and cultures just so you could say the communist Chinese, the David Rockefeller, Putin power are better than everybody?
[58:31.000 --> 58:44.000]  That is a sick, freakish joke. And I will not stand by and watch humanity turn over to these people and I beg God for the strength and the will to have the discernment to help be part of their defeat.
[58:44.000 --> 58:58.000]  And I've been saying that prayer for 20 plus years and God is delivering because God is great. Thank God for his son, Jesus Christ. And now let's move forward against the NW.
[58:58.000 --> 59:06.000]  The globalist and their Democrat minions are on the verge of taking this cold civil war hot.
[59:06.000 --> 59:18.000]  They have pushed and pushed and pushed and engaged in hoaxes and crimes and censorship and sabotage of the economy and attacks run by the UN on the border that are nothing short of war.
[59:18.000 --> 59:29.000]  And that's because it is a war by multinational corporations, ally with the chai comms and others with the Hollywood, America hating, God hating filth to try to capture the United States.
[59:29.000 --> 59:38.000]  This is 21st century war and wars need money to be prosecuted and we're actually winning the war, but the enemy's throwing their full way at us right now.
[59:38.000 --> 59:44.000]  That's why we need financial support. It's a total 360 win, double patriot points, 50% off, store-wide free shipping.
[59:44.000 --> 59:48.000]  It's about to end with a running out of a lot of these products at infowarstore.com.
[59:48.000 --> 59:54.000]  And I need you to get in there, step to the plate, get high quality products you already need and find the information more.
[59:54.000 --> 59:56.000]  infowarstore.com.
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:04.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  All right, we got callers that disagree with me. They think Trump needs to be impeached. We're going to them next segment, Bonnie and Brandon and others.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  And then we're going to open the phones up for everybody on the civil war that's going hot more and more, the attempts to impeach Trump, the deep state openly threatening to kill Trump and others on TV.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  This is terrorism they're engaged in. So what do you do when these globalists that hate the country are doing this?
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  They're the ones that have taken us to this point. That's coming up next segment and more on the communist China threatening the NBA to accept their directives or they won't let the NBA into China.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  But first, here's a key report.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  After we got banned off YouTube and every other major platform last year, we set out to build something that's very easy to navigate, very easy to find.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  You're looking for it very, very easy to share. So the first thing you want to do is realize there's two different ways to easily navigate band.video.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  The first stop is up in the left hand corner, the three lines right by band.video logo.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  If you click that, it shows all the hosts, all the different contributors. When you go to their page, if they're live, it will show that they're live on air.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  If they're not live, their last full show will be archived in the first line of videos.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  Below that, you don't have time to watch the full show like most of us don't, we'll have hot informative clips and then beneath that we'll have special reports, documentaries, speeches, special events and guests underneath that as well.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  So there's these three rows of videos that make navigation easy on each one of the links you see on the side.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  The Alex Jones show, The War Room with Owen Schroyer, David Knight show, Firepower with that great crew, Paul Watson, Caitlin Bennett, Millie Lieber, John Baum, special reports and again a bunch of others that we've now added as well.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  Another way to navigate is simply right off the front page where the shows are posted from the top right down and if somebody's live, you'll see the live feature right there.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  You can click and watch the show. While watching the full shows or clips, when you find that vital piece of information that you really want to share with people, it's very, very easy to do.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  All you do to download is just click the download button below any of the videos and then it's yours. Free to Air. Share it however you want, stream it out, repost it, edit it.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  This is free to air, fair use, 100% your purview to use however you see fit in the information war. Whether it's an archive show, whether it's a clip, whether it's a hot meme, it's critical that you share the links,
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  especially the live shows when there's breaking news. That's a great way to go viral with the truth and get over that Berlin Wall of Lies, the globalist to put out there.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  And again, we've got a lot of different ways to share the videos right underneath them. That is the next part of the equation. When you do that, it changes the world.
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  All the censorship, all the attacks have been about stopping you from sharing that information.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  So keep checking back at band.video and realize there's nothing out there in the world that represents nationalism, patriotism, capitalism, the free market, Americana, that is this sophisticated or this good.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  Now granted, it's nothing compared to Facebook or Google, but that's how these things begin. So we built in four years ago, we've got radio satellites, we've got TV satellites, we're syndicated on radio and TV, we have our own audio and video feeds,
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  but we wanted to put something out that's easy to navigate like YouTube and that can be expanded. So this is really an arsenal of freedom going into 2020 to counter the globalist and their CHICOM handlers that are trying to overthrow this country
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  and force a coup against a sitting president while they try to silence all the independent media that are still faithful to our nation, faithful to truth, faithful to journalism, and our republic.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  So a new key weapon in the fight against the globalist and a key weapon to fight for a free humanity, not just for Americans but people worldwide is band.video.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  Please check it out today and also share it with your friends, family and neighbors in your community because we truly are in an information war and there is a war on for our minds.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  If we didn't have power, the system wouldn't be trying to shut us up. The truth is, truth does have power. So let's spread it today. The truth lives at band.video. So please join us in this epic fight. Thank you all.
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone. Simply go to band.video with your Safari browser. Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen. When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  It will then ask you to name the app. I suggest band.video. You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube. However you want, be sure and share band.video.
[1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  We are now into the second hour on this October 7, 2019 global transmission. About 25 minutes ago, open the phones up and said, if you disagree, I think Trump really should be impeached.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  Well, it's your chance to call in. You can always call in. We're not like leftist talk radio where they only get people that agree with them. That's what they do. We're not sensors like those that run the colleges now and have turned them into institutions of brainwashing and Soviet style learning.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  No, we want to hear from you. And I see that in 25 minutes or so, 30 minutes you've had to get on the phone and call us. Four of you have called and gotten on the line.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  Bonnie, Gerald, Brandon and someone else I see they're queuing up. So we're going to go to you here in just a moment.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  And then everybody else can now call in at this point 877789 Alex 8777892539 on this Monday edition. If you just joined us, the big giant, huge earth shaking news is on info wars.com and news wars.com.
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  And originates an article from Mike Adams at natural news.com. I worked with him on the report. I have some of my sources as well that confirm that President Trump, if he feels like he's being removed extra judicially outside of impeachment,
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  that he will call the Marines out to defend the executive branch from coup plotters. Just because Phil Mudd and Robert Mueller and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama say that Trump's a Russian agent when they're the globalist and they're the foreign agents,
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  like a travel agent selling us out to the highest bidder, just because they all say that doesn't mean they get to removing. And they're all over the Aspen Institute CNN MSNBC saying the government's going to kill this guy. We're going to stab him in the back.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  We're going to kill Giuliani. We're going to burn down their supporters. We're going to wipe out their supporters. These are all quotes.
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  I mean, I've been playing for months almost every day, compilations of them saying impeach, imprison, kill Trump, kill his family, kill his supporters, intimidate everybody, sue everybody, have fake women coming forward saying they were raped.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  None of that's true. It turns out the private fellow was herb trying to crash the economy to kill the Trump recovery. Bill Maher saying they want to kill the recovery to teach Trump supporters a lesson.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  This is terrorism. It's economic. It's physical. It's threats. It's the definition of terrorism. Let's pull up the definition of terrorism.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  It's threatening violent acts or carrying out violent acts for a political aim. That is the definition. And if that isn't what the Democrats and MSM are doing, I don't know what is.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  They use the violence or the threat of violence, especially against civilians in the pursuit of political goals. Resort to terrorizing methods as a means of coercion.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  A state of fear and submission produced by the prevalence of such methods. The act of terrorizing, a state of being terrorized, a mode of governance by terror intimidation.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  If you look at all studies, there's a big stack up right here. I've covered this probably 20 times the last few months, but I'll show it again later. Just type in. Studies show coverage of mass shootings causes the mass shootings.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  And they're always incel antifa that do it and they try to cover that up. And then they admit that Joker is meant to trigger an antifa bloody uprising and glorifies randomly shooting people on the streets of their white or police officers.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  Everybody that sees it goes, wow, you're right. It's glorification of antifa and killing everybody and all these beautiful losers, you know, going out and becoming more beautiful as little butterflies coming out of their.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  And murder it. Because there's no propaganda that overthrows countries. And so Hollywood already hates America. So they're perfect to take billions and Chicom money a quarter to spew all of this.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  By the way, it's in the news that the big six Hollywood production houses are owned by Chicoms. The other two or so are getting bought out. Trump blocked some of those.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  In the news that 10 cent this giant Chinese Chicom company has $1.5 billion and it's pulling that because a manager of the Rockets said on a tweet saying he supported.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  Hong Kong independence when they have a treaty that they shouldn't be under China.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  It's a level of bullying. Oh, one person said something in your giant organization that has tens of thousands of employees. Because they want their control here leveraged against us.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  And of course, he apologized and pissed all over himself. America and the world is at a crossroads. How much will you grovel? How much will you give in to just every special interest out there, including foreign, authoritarian countries?
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  And then Hillary tells us that Russia is running things. Putin says everywhere we should not be involved in any of America's decisions or any of their politics or culture, but you stay out of ours.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  And I'm here to tell you, Russia is not involved other than in their interest. Putin's cut the spending for the military. He's cut intelligence funding massively.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  I'm not fighting you. I know what you got planned. You're moving nukes up to our borders. I'm not going to do it. You're not going to bankrupt us with this.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  And then Putin helped us take out ISIS in al-Qaeda in Syria. It's admirable. And that's why Hillary and other globalists are so scared because they don't want real peace.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  Trump wants real peace, but people that want it, that China is our adversary because it doesn't respect us because the globalists put them in power and have used them as leverage to take us out economically and culturally.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  So which side are you on? Now I'm going to go to people that disagree. Brandon?
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  Now we got phones loaded now. So just give me a favor. Mark each one that disagrees. I'll go to them first. Bonnie's first, then Gerald, then Brandon, and there's one other that disagrees.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  I'm going to go to you all first. You think Trump should be impeached? So let's go to Bonnie in Nevada first. Bonnie, thanks for calling. Welcome.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  Hi, Alex. Can you hear me? Yes, I can. Go ahead.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  Great. Okay. Well, first I want to say that I'm a first-time caller. Thank you for taking my call and big supporter. I just am a new listener.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  I've only been listening a couple of weeks, but I just bought a huge amount of stuff on your infowars shop and I hope you stay around for a long, long time.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  So anyway, just to explain my thought processes here, I'm a big trans supporter. I helped, you know, I actually worked for him to get him into office and I don't think that he should be that there's anything that he's done yet that's impeachable.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  However, if, and I want to say this because my first husband is a retired military officer, retired U.S. pilot, U.S. Air Force pilot, second husband's a retired chief in the Army, and I have a degree in political science.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  And this is what my first husband taught me, and I think he's correct, that you cannot, and this is, you know, you have said that he's planning on possibly using the United States Marines to stave off a coup.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  If that's true, that would be impeachable. And this is why, because you cannot use the United States military on United States soil against United States citizens.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  His option for that would be if he feels there's going to be a coup. His option for protection is the guard.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  He cannot use the United States military. That would be a violation of the Constitution and it would be an abuse of his power as commander in chief.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  Yes, yes, and it would be disastrous for the country and for him. So what he needs to do, okay, and he should do, if he feels there's going to be a coup, is by gosh, he's got the guard.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  He's got plenty of guard. He's got guard in every state, and he should use them. That's what his options are for that.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  But using the United States military would just be a total disaster.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  Well, they're calling up marine reserves. Well, you know, it's still the Marines. It's still the United States military, and it's absolutely forbidden.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  Sure.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  Well, you're a smart lady, and I'm very honored to have you as a listener.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  I've written books on the police state. I've made films on it.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  And I'm absolutely against the police state, and I've had every constitutional lawyer you can imagine from Edwin Vieira to you name it.
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  I've had Rand Paul on. I've had Ron Paul on, and you know they're all against offensive wars.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  And I would think you'd agree with me that the people like Ron Paul are against the police state, right?
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  Yeah.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  And I am against the police state. Stay there. I'm going to come back to you. This is an important body.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  Don't hang up. Then Brandon, Gerald, and there's some others that disagree with the president as well that want phones open up.

[1:15:52.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  This is not the Marines for law enforcement. This is the Marines protecting a branch of government under assault by criminal group.
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  I'll explain it when we come back.

[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  The gauntlet has been thrown down.
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  Every major Democrat candidate has come out and said they want to confiscate all semi-auto firearms.
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  And now Buddha Judge has come out and said that it's about political power.
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  That's why they want the guns.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  Well, finally they're being honest because all their lies haven't got them to the point they want.
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  So now they're just trying to normalize all this tyranny.
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  It shows what incredible followers these people are.
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  The globalists know they're not going to get this without a civil war.
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:44.000]  And they know that the minions trying to carry this out are not going to be in a good position in that civil war.
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  But it's up to us to understand the big picture, to carry the fight to the enemy and the information war before they can kick off a hot civil war.

[1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:10.000]  But it's up to you to unleash its full potential. Banned.video.
[1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:18.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  We've got open phones. President Trump has said that we're entering a civil war. That deep state globalists that literally hate this country are attempting to have government employees tell lies.
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  Because they're in the Democratic Party and build a false consensus removing from office. They're now talking about using the 22nd Amendment by threatening his cabinet to remove him.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  They're now threatening to kill his cabinet or put them in prison if they don't do this. On the news.
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  About all these videos where they fantasize about what prison cells are going to put them in. This is terrorism. You better step down or I'm going to put you in prison. I'm going to kill you.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  Now, I totally agree that at the end of the civil war, we need to pass a law posse commentatus, but it's already in the Bill of Rights that you shouldn't quarter troops amongst the people that we don't want a standing domestic army.
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  And I'm against police states and everybody knows that. I want to explain something. If Martians hypothetically invaded, and I don't think they're really invading before the news runs that headline, and we're attacking the Pentagon.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  Well, that it would be the Marines, the Army, the Air Force, the Navy's job to defend the Pentagon.
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  You wouldn't say, oh, posse commentatus, you can't have the military operating because it's not that you can't have the military operating on domestic soil.
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  You can't have it involved with civilian law enforcement dealing with civilian laws and civilian courts because it's not its jurisdiction.
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  But when Mexican troops or cartels shoot at citizens or the border patrol or shipping drugs in, it's the President's purview to put the Air Force, the Army, the Marines on the border.
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  It's the National Guard that's called up by governors or then an emergency is unified under the President to deal with an earthquake or a tornado or a hurricane or a giant terror attack or a bio weapons release or a huge chemical plant that blows up.
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  That's what we're talking about.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  And so I understand the ladies and political scientists and she's had husbands that were in the government do these things. And I'm glad she's aware of posse commentatus. I really am.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  But I'm particularly aware I've been, I was warned by people in the mid 1990s, Bill Clinton was trying to prepare a plan to actually take over governors and others if they resisted in a martial law scenario.
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  That later came out that Clinton was looking at that. And I was told this by the Army, because they had Delta Force going around preparing this and doing this.
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  And I'm not going to go tell that whole story again. The point is, is that I've been all over this like flies on, you know what, or white on rice.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  It's the Democrats that have brought us this point. It's the deep state threatening and attacking and saying they're going to kill people and bringing forward fake information.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:05.000]  And now if they try to physically grab the president, he's checked with the Marines and understand their history.
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  And it's their job to protect the president if people try to take him in the United States extra judicially.
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  If they're having an impeachment and they have the Senate vote, even if they twist and threaten people in the Senate, and it probably looks like it was a scam, I'll support the because it's constitutional.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  This means, you know, we're a bunch of cowards and they got intimidated and threatened and the branches government failed us.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  But I wouldn't want Trump to become a dictator at that point.
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  But I would want to remove those senators and get somebody else elected.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  But because it would be too on the line to figure out exactly what happened and it would invite Trump behaving like a dictator, but he doesn't want to do that.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  He wants to turn the country around and fail off to the sunset. The Trump name be platinum.
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  So what does the president do if they go in a 22nd Amendment coup and try to grab him?
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  He's protected by the Marines that there's a reason that's going on.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  And the Marines aren't under Posse commentators in law, which I've said should be changed.
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  But if you go into the actual details of it, because it goes with maritime and our borders, there is a special subsection that gives them an immunity because of the president again.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  Don't you know Congress would raise its own army if it couldn't take over the courts would do it too.
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  We have three branches of government who balance power. This is an attack on the executive branch.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  The global escape incredible power to the executive branch before Trump got in because it was their puppet.
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  Now they're all freaked out. Trump got us out of WTO corruption and made them change.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  He got us out of the TPP. He did a whole bunch of stuff that was unprecedented using that power.
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  That's why they're freaking out. He's been very judicious.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  I don't think he's been strong enough on censorship.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  If anything, he hasn't acted strong enough because he's faced with a very authoritarian attack, a constellation of terroristic thugs.
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  Go ahead and blow that up for me. They found the subsection there. Although the Navy and Marine Corps are not included in the act, they were made subject to it by DOD regulation in 1992.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  But that's actually not in the act. That's a regulation that can be overridden by the president, the secretary of defense.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  See, I've done my homework. I didn't have them just pull that approve. I'm right.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  But Bonnie, this is all an issue of separation of powers.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  And if we really believe he's wrong, if they come after him and try to blow the White House up, they can try to kill him.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  If somebody tried to drive ammonium nitrate into the White House, it was driven by Phil Mudd, who says he wants to kill the president.
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  Would it be wrong for Marines to open fire on him? Would that be a violation of positive commentatus?
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  I would say the National Guard still needs to be used.
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  Okay, but if they're not there, it's Marines and they're up there with anti-tank missiles on the roof.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  They are on top of the roof with anti-tank missiles.
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  Okay, and let's say Phil Mudd, they got anti-aircraft missiles.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  Phil Mudd has a jet aircraft and he's going to fly it into the White House.
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  He said he's going to kill the president. He's going to stab Giuliani.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  So he's saying he's going to kill him. He's going to run counterterrorism.
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  So he has the means. He gets the jet, loads it up, he's a kamikaze.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  I guess the president just opens his chest up and says, posse commentatus, and then Phil Mudd just flies the airplane into his chest.
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  Why can't he mobilize the Guard right now to start to protect himself rather than having to go to that extreme?
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  You know, either way you look at it.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  Well, ma'am, just to be clear, I'm going to hold you over. I'm going to let you talk right now and we'll go to the calls at the break.
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  I'm using a ridiculous hypothetical. I'm saying it's the Marines guarding the White House. That's in the Constitution.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  It's not the National Guard, but please continue.
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  Oh, you're talking to me?
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  Yeah, go ahead and make your point. I apologize.
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  Okay, no, no. It becomes a revolution. It becomes the same coup that we're trying to avoid.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  So to me, it's the state. Remember the Rosa Park thing?
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  When they sent the Guard down there to make sure that the law was followed.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  Okay, when she couldn't, you know, the Guard?
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  You're absolutely right. That was the states. Why do you think it was the Marines that quietly stopped the attempted coup on FDR?
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  That's their job.
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  Well, I tell you, it's a debatable issue, Alex.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  Have you ever heard, like they said, the President will send a squad of Marines down to grab somebody if the President wants to talk to somebody in an emergency?
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  You understand the separation of powers. It's the purview that the Marines guard the President. You understand that, right?
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  I can see it on a foreign soil. Sure. If he's flying out on Air Force One and he's out in Libya or whatnot.
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  But what if globalists have taken over America and have the President surrounded?
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  But how do you, that's where everything becomes all muddy. Because then the Dems could get in and do the same thing and say it about themselves.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  Ma'am, I agree. It is muddy because Phil Mudd used to run assassination teams and he's on TV saying he's going to kill the President.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  So when they're all saying they're going to kill him, all over the news, he's activating the Marines in case they try it. That's all.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  Nothing offensive. He's just lifting a shield. As he told my confidant, his confidant, he would do.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:29:00.000]  Great points, Bonnie. Love to have smart collars like you. Think you've got legitimate points while we're debating it? Thank you. Call me back again.
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  Well, Brandon, you disagree with me as well. We'll talk to you straight ahead than the rest of the college. Stay with us in FullWars.com.
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  Go to BlackRifleRealEstate.com. That's BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:15.000]  The truth is President Trump is the most investigated President in history. He is working for American interests steadfastly.
[1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:27.000]  He is trying to preserve our country as the globalists try to break our borders, bankrupt and devalue our dollar and sign us over to communist Chinese control who now own Hollywood and the majority of our debt.
[1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  We have been maneuvered towards a collapse in bankruptcy, but at the 11th hour, 58th minute, the American people put a populist in power.
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:44.000]  And it's happening all over the world. So great things are happening, but the enemy is striking back. They're very serious with this impeachment plan.
[1:30:44.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  It has bipartisan support, and I'm telling you, President Trump needs our prayers, and InfoWars needs your prayers and support.
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:31:02.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are trying to shut us down, but right now it's easier than ever to financially support us while getting great products at the same time with Black Friday comes two months early with store-wide free shipping,
[1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:06.000]  double Patriot points and, ladies and gentlemen, 50% off.
[1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:28.000]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.video on your iPhone. Simply go to Band.video with your Safari browser, then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen.
[1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:36.000]  When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen. It will then ask you to name the app. I suggest Band.video.
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:42.000]  You will now have Band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:50.000]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:32:00.000]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube. However you want, be sure to share Band.video.
[1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  And of course he famously settled on many others that Trump is the Info Wars president.
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the Info Wars president.
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  You know what is true? Our audience of activists, our guests, our crew, and my drive and your drive has brought Trump to the White House and other nationalists to power around the world, and now Trump's openly coming out and declaring war on these globalist tyrants and their unelected anti-human tyrannies.
[1:32:50.000 --> 1:33:04.000]  So this is a day of great victory, and I salute you all, but now I'm the thick of the fight. So infowarstore.com for products you need, massive sales now so we can continue on to the future and give these bastards one hell of a fight right until the end
[1:33:04.000 --> 1:33:06.000]  until we've defeated them.
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  Alright, we're going to Brandon in Louisiana, then Gerald, then everybody else that has called in just on the general topic of impeachment of Trump and the Marines, being activated for domestic emergency, civil crisis, which will have little or no
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  warning sites threats the homeland. And this is all in this climate of martial law, civil war, impeachment, deep state saying they're going to kill the president, out of control private intelligence agencies thinking they're God.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  And these groups have totally sold us out the NBA, following orders from the communist Chinese to censure and maybe even fire a manager at the Rockets, because he said on Twitter he supported Hong Kong protesters.
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  That's globalism for you. That's the censorship Alex Jones last year. Now it's the Houston Rockets manager.
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  Oh, you can't have any political views.
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  Think about that. Oh, and the same company that basically bought Reddit for 150 million 10 cent. They're the ones involved pulling the 1.5 billion from the NBA deal being able to move into China because they didn't like what one employee of one company said.
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  That'll teach everybody. That's where the left censorship goes.
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  So these callers are disagreeing with me. They're talking about why Trump should be impeached. Well, she's saying if he uses the Marines, well, I think if he uses the Marines that grab his enemies, he should be.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  But I'm talking about if outside of government, just a rogue group comes out to the president or announces he's being removed, who protects the president? It's the Marines.
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  That's the point. So I think there's a misunderstanding here about Posse Commentatus. We're not saying the Marines are going to be running, you know, radar duty on the highway or any of that.
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  This just shows where we are, how things have escalated. Let's go to Brandon and then Gerald Brandon from Louisiana disagrees.
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  Please tell me why. Hey, how you doing, Alex? I like I like the preferences by saying I'm a patriot. I'm a veteran. I'm a huge supporter of info wars and I buy your products month. Well, thank you, sir.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  Sometimes by weekly. Yeah, no problem. I just want to jump straight to the chase that we've let this problem faster for the last three and a half years, and we should have taken action a long time ago.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  I understand that the president surrounded by cowards and people like Phil mud who say that he's going to come out to the president and do some do some really strange things to the president.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  I just I wanted action. A while ago, like I'll give you an analogy of Alex if you had a if you had a if you had the flu or you had a really bad illness, you wouldn't lay in bed for, you know, weeks at a time until the illness took off your body and almost killed you and then go see the doctor.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  You would get up when you started feeling funny or you had or you had some symptoms and you would go take care of it.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  I'm trying to know you're right. That's exactly what I would do before I really got sick and couldn't get out of bed. You're absolutely right.
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  Right. I'm trying to understand why we've we've got to this point, which I do, which is a rhetorical question. I do understand why we got to this point because he's surrounded by coward.
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  But I want him to I really want the solution to this problem. And you said this before is that we should be having national press conferences.
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  The president should have a national press conference detailing the amount of corruption that we're in because most people don't understand the amount of the level of corruption that we're up against.
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  And he should be playing your videos on a national level. Seeing it and everybody will tune in because they can't survive without him for the ratings.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  He should be playing your videos and detailing when you say that he should support a new independent Twitter.
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  He has the power still to take their power away to stop the censorship and to save this country.
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  And I agree he's not being hardcore enough because he doesn't want to panic the country.
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  Well, listen, they're taking that as a sign of weakness and they're moving against him.
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  So you mean this tongue in cheek because he hasn't done enough to protect himself in the country.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  If he's asking for it, hell, then let him have it's what you're saying.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  That's right. That's exactly what I'm saying. I don't want I don't want to I pray for you. I pray for the president.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  I pray for all Americans.
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  The world.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  I don't want anything bad to happen to the president. I don't want anything bad to happen to you or I.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  But if we're if we're if we're watching somebody breaking our back door and we don't engage that threat and we let them go walk around the house and go through our safe and fondle our wife and go ahead and make.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  And rape our kids future or kill our kid right in front of us. They're killing babies after they're born.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  No, you've got a great point. And I think the lady before was confused. We're not saying the Marines are going to run around and, you know, take people's guns.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  That's the Democrats saying that. No, I mean, Trump activating the Marines to protect himself.
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  I think shows he realizes now how much dangerous he's in and he has escalated his rhetoric.
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  But I hope that moves into indictments quickly. God bless you. I appreciate your call Brandon.
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  I don't really disagree. But we got one person really disagree. But I get his point. I mean, I get mad at Trump too.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  Gerald in New York disagrees. He says that Trump needs to be in peace. Go ahead.
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  Hello, Alex.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  Yes, sir.
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  How you doing, my brother?
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  Good.
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  I'm in I'm in Brooklyn, New York. I've been a long time listener to the program.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  And, you know, I've been following what's going on. The president I supported the president.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  But man, the brother, he don't even know how to talk to the press. He don't know how to talk to his constituents.
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  And he keep talking about low African American unemployment.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  Man, I've been struggling with my auto mechanic business trying to get that up and running.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  And every time that we try to move step forward, the brother's taken two steps back.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  And I'm just confused as to is he supported his people is supported himself. Where is he going with this?
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  The truth is the economy was already in a depression. Basically, Trump got in and tried to fix it.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  The Federal Reserve raised interest rate eight times to block that.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  And, you know, the truth is he can't get it all done. But I mean, I hear you, I've got a lot of family.
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  They've got multiple degrees and, you know, they can't find good decent jobs because we got sold out to China.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  So I think he just came in when the ship was already sinking and a lot of us get pissed because he can't ride it fast enough.
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  I just know this. The answer is he must go on the offense. We all must go on the offense.
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  Very aggressively, legal and lawfully because the the globalists are trying to intimidate us in the submission right now.
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  But, you know, he let this stuff go on way too long with Joe Biden.
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  He know about Joe Biden over in the Ukraine with the funny business with Hunter.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  And also he see this coming with the with the whole Russian collusion from day one and it let that faster.
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  He should have jumped on that.
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  Brother, I hear you. God bless you. I appreciate your call.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  You know, you talk about trying to run your own auto repair business. And believe me, I know that's a tough business.
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  I got a great crew that tries to do a great job and they do.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  Nowadays equipment, even in Fox News, I don't folks, it's constantly breaking.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  There's just the regulation and bureaucrats come banging on the door.
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  Believe me, imagine what it's like for Trump.
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  And I'm not saying you want instant gratification.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  But things are complex.
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  But I agree with you. He better get way more aggressive or they're going to destroy him.
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  He is overconfident sometimes.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  But that's a leadership trait. You know, Hillary's overconfident in a bad way.
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  So I agree with you. We're in an insane time right now.
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  OK, you've got Al killer, who's active duty Navy MP on Trump and the Marines.
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  We're going to go to him in a moment. We've got a Brad impeachment.
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  Would we accept it? That's a good question. What are we going to do if that happens?
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  If they were moving the impeachment derangement syndrome?
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  We'll talk to Dan. We'll talk to Will and Oregon. We'll talk to Joe, Alex, Jason.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  We'll get to everybody. We're going to come right back on the side of this break.
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  And then we'll just take calls with Mike Adams right through the next hour.
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  I'm going to get to everybody 877789 Alex 8777892539.
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  You heard the last caller before the last one talking about support the broadcast.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  Yes. And thank you very much, sir, from Louisiana for supporting us.
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  We make it very, very easy to support us. We have great fluoride free toothpaste,
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  four to five o'clock little silver and iodine. It's 50% off.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  We have the very best turmeric 95% of cumanoid. Nobody else has that that we know of.
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  Most brands have 5% and then still really helps with inflammation and just so many other things as an antioxidant.
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  It's just it's magic.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  We have the best krill oil. We have the best fish oil. We have the best honor roll for children.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  We have the very best bone broth. It's the strongest, best organic chicken bone broth.
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  It's got to be like the equivalent like 20 bowls of chicken broth without the calories of all that essence in every serving.
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  And then you've got the chaga mushroom, also the bee pollen and of course, turmeric as well.
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  So for just overall nutrients that are so good for your joints, your body, everything.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  If you don't know what real bone broth does, grandma certainly did check out her ultimate bone broth.
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  It's going to sell out soon and they won't have more until probably four or five months in the next year.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  Because I'm not going to order more until it sells out and it takes about four or five months to get an order back in.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  So that's available at InformerShore.com. I had to extend the super sale just a few more days.
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  Black Friday comes early because I've been so busy I haven't come up with a new sale yet.
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  But this is our best since Christmas. Store wide free shipping, 50% off, double Patriot points and a lot of other big specials.

[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  Well, Trump got that and all these other populace get it.
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  Why would you throw away wealthy, successful countries and cultures just so you can say the communist Chinese, the David Rockefeller put in power are better than everybody?
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:42.000]  That is a sick, freakish joke.
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  And I will not stand by and watch humanity turn over to these people.
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:52.000]  And I beg God for the strength and the will to have the discernment to help me part of their defeat.
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:57.000]  And I've been saying that prayer for 20 plus years and God is delivering because God is great.
[1:43:57.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  Thank God for his son, Jesus Christ. And now let's move forward against the NW.
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  It's all at band.video. We've got the full press conference. We've got my boil down of how epic it is.
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  It's all at band.video. And I just, you've got to share this with people because Trump was hitting on all 45 cylinders.
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  This was amazing. And he turned the nitrous oxide on top of it.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  So in full wars, America, Trump, all of us incredible things are happening.
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:53.000]  And we're sharing the ideas that are going to defeat the tyrants at band.video.
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  And I got to tell you, we've done great video work. We've done great films. We've done so much.
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  But websites are not our thing. Well, now they are. I'm so proud of band.video folks.

[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  This is 21st century war. And wars need money to be prosecuted. And we're actually winning the war.
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  But the enemy's throwing their full weight at us right now. That's why we need financial support.

[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  We represent the organic human resistance to tyranny. We grew right out of the Texas soil with your support.
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  We are 100% authentic. The globalists are 100% inauthentic. We are human. We believe in a human future.
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  And we believe in God our Creator will lead God and direct us. We open ourselves up for the transmissions of the Holy Spirit to guide us against the enemy.
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  And we will win. We have the top general. But that general gave us free will.
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  All right, you see this on screen right over here? Exclusive, Trump activates US Marine reserves for emergency within the United States to stop illegal coup.
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  Read the Marine Corps documents for yourself. It's at newswars.com and infowars.com with direct links to it.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  We're going to write back to your phone calls. And Mike Adams is going to be on next hour. We'll take calls with him as well on this key subject.
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  Now, I want to explain something.
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  If you see a coup in Guatemala or a coup in Venezuela or a coup in Turkey, you'll have a government faction backed by normally an offshore group.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  Sometimes they're a good coup. Sometimes they're a bad coup. Sometimes they're trying to overthrow a dictator. Sometimes they're trying to overthrow an election of a good president like we see here.
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  It's all about who can get control of the media and who can announce that it's legitimate and then who can get the president or prime minister or dictator, in the case of Venezuela, out of power, and is the president dug in with security services he can trust
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  while he gets a message out explaining, hey, Congress didn't impeach me. This isn't constitutional. This is illegal. I'm fine. I'm not mentally ill.
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  What they'll try to do is drug him. This is how this will work, one of the ways. They could try to drug him, then say he's gone insane, say he's having seizures, say he's in the hospital.
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  They could obviously shoot his vehicle with any tank missile, blow his helicopter up with any aircraft missile. It'll be an inside job.
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  I mean, they're saying they're going to kill him. So I think this is overdue him activating the Marines for the homeland to protect the executive branch from rogue elements in the government that are on national TV and control the media because it's
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  foreign owned saying he's illegitimate and a traitor and a criminal when they are illegitimate and they are the liars and they are the traitors and they are the criminals.
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  So in full wars, 25 years was built and made for this moment we're entering right now. And you notice we're just hitting on stride now.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  Our afterburners are hitting our final boosters to go to the next level right as this is all unfolding. It's God's plan. You're in God's plan as well.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  So it's frustrating to see all this evil and to know all this and not see more action. But remember, you're awake.
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  And so the takedown of the globalist is going to take longer, but it's exponential. That's why they're having to censor. It's why they're trying to do all this.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  The Chai comms are now trying to censor open US media, the National Basketball League.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  This is the awakening. The NFL is trying to hide it. Reportedly, they're more than half down in ticket sales. Their ratings are down 40% because they tried to tell America to suck Kami weenie.
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  Excuse my French, but it's not going to happen. They may have a bunch of zombies in San Francisco and some areas in New York, not know what planet they're on, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  But the rest of us, whether we're black, white, old, young, got our damn head screwed on half straight and we're not going to bend over to a bunch of globalist BS.
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  My God. Now, managers of baseball teams can't even say they support people that are being invaded by the Chai comms. That's how far we've come.
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  Big article up on infowars.com. Then they came for Joe Rogan. Got a big report I shot last night that's premiering right now. Go see it. Go share it.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:40.000]  They're now censoring him. Told him that. Let's go back to your phone calls right now.
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  Al killer is active duty Navy should have gone to them first in case they're at work and an MP on Trump and the Marines. Al killer. What's your take on this?
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  Well, Alex, first, I just want to say it's great to be back talking to you. I've been overseas the last two years, so I've been unable to call in.
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  Remember you calling years ago. Welcome back, Al killer.
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:52:05.000]  Absolutely. So, and no, I'm on leave right now, but I'll be going back tomorrow. So I have plenty of time to talk. But so let's go.
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  Let's start with President Trump activating the Marine Reserve. You had about three colors back. You had somebody mentioned that the United States Navy Marine Corps, not under the positive commentators.
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  And that's exactly right. We were not even supposed to have a standing army. The Navy is the only constitutional military branch is every right to activate the United States Marine Reserve for any purpose he wants.
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  That's right. It's in the Constitution that that's the only standing military. Exactly. And that is off top. He's completely justified in doing what he's doing. Obviously, we don't want the slippery slope is what we don't want.
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  But President Trump is not going to go there.
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  Well, it's the globalist saying kill the president overthrow everyone since they're the ones already overthrowing the country. So in a way, if he doesn't start taking action against him, it's a dereliction of duty.
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:07.000]  I'm sorry. And that's what the other caller was saying. If Trump doesn't really start moving against him, then he's letting him do this to us. And I'm not trying to be mean to the president. He's surrounded by a bunch of cowards.
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  But we're here to tell him the American people aren't cowards. We don't want him to resign. We don't want him to step down because that's what they're threatening to do. I meant to start the show with this.
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  And I'll go back to you, sir. I'm sorry. They're all over. And I'll play it next hour. Joy Reid. They're all over ABC, NBC, MSNBC.
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  The new talking point is resign or will cause a civil war. So that's the terrorism I'm talking about. We need to be calling the White House and everything else saying do not resign. We're ready to go to whatever we have to.
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  We're not going to start the fight like Bunker Hill. But if they came looking for a war, they're going to get one. Are you ready?
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:42.000]  Here's the other thing.
[1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  I'm asking you a question, Al Killer. Are you ready and the people you know in the military?
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:55.000]  I will give my life right now. I would pour gasoline on me to paraphrase the great Lieutenant Colonel Allen West and light a match on it for this Republican for this country and for my God.
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  Me too.
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:54:01.000]  Because it's about not letting these damn child molesters have their way anymore. It's about fighting evil.
[1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  Exactly. I called the FBI last night after your show about Phil Mudd. We're talking about sticking a shiv in ex mayor Giuliani's back. Everybody needs to do it. I did the same thing when he threatened to say that the president would be killed two or three years ago right after listening to your show.
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:27.000]  I called the FBI. Everybody should flood the line. We're not going to have a bunch of unelected bureaucrats threatening our president or any other citizens that are sticking up.
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  And remember, Mudd ran the kill teams. He never did it himself. He's a pencil pusher, but this is a guy that ran assassination squads saying he's going to kill the president.
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  And another guy, as Gerald Salante says, can't run up a flat stairs, can't punch the way out of a paper bag that sends other people to do the dirty work.
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  He's got a lot of nerve, but he's there to get people to believe that they're in charge. He's not, is he?
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  If they were in charge, they wouldn't be out there talking. If people don't understand what is going on with all these ex spooks and intelligence agents on the mainstream media, how more obvious does it have to be what is going on here?
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  And I want to tell you something. Lee Stranahan has everything nailed down. He was just talking about a New York time article or it could be Washington Post or Washington Times.
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  I could be wrong from about a month before President Kennedy was assassinated saying that if any agency was going to carry out a coup, it would be the CIA.
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  Yeah, that was a New York Times interview. I've seen that. I almost covered that last week. We should get Lee Stranahan back on. He's a really smart guy.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  Where Kennedy was saying the CIA may basically engage in a coup against me. And again, it's the criminals at the top of it that run it.
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  I'm not defending the agency. It's just if you say the whole thing, that's ridiculous. It's the people running it believe they own this country.
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  People appointees that are there to be the managers with the blackmail that they could tell the agents what to do and keep them compartmentalized. That's why they're political appointees.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  So they don't go after what's really going on. I hate when Kennedy says the 99% or whatever with the FBI. Of course we understand that.
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  It's the people that are on the ground, other people really doing the work. But nobody says anything or does anything about these unelected people on TV and on top of these agencies.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  How would Hillary Clinton not be behind bars?
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  Well, that's it. And that's why they're so arrogant. And that's why they think they're so powerful. That's why they think, hey, we've had control forever.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  So we can do whatever we want. God bless you, Al. Killer. Good to hear from you.
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  All right, let's jam in one more before we go to break them. We'll hold them over as well. Let's talk to Dan in Texas. Dan, thanks for holding her on the air.
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  Yeah, how are you doing, Alex? I love your show.
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  Thank you.
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  Yeah, hey, I just wanted to kind of recap and touch on a couple of different subjects. One being where does the line actually stop and begin from where you have mainstream media out like calling for any kind of violence against say President Trump or any of this.
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  It seems like they're pushing this narrative more and more.
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  Oh, well, that's it. They're normalizing that they're getting ready to grab him or kill him or say they had to do it and then threaten everybody else to just go along with it.
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  They're actually testing. You know how a parent will put its beak out to test a branch to see if the branch will hold it.
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:33.000]  These bastards, these pieces of filth. I know a lot of good folks that cover single parents. That's not a nice name. Call bastards, you know. These pieces of Roach filth are testing the waters to kill Trump.
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  And then they're saying, and we're going to come after all the supporters. Well, guess what, jackasses? I mean, I'm tired of talking with these people. You little chicken next son of them.
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:48.000]  You know what? Fill mud in all of them. I've got some big problems on their hands and they better back off right now.
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:55.000]  That's not a threat. You're going to get their asses handed to them. They keep pushing this crap. You want a war? You're going to get one, son.
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:25.000]  Faso Beats helps support the body's natural nitric oxide production. Oh, that is the biggie. Well, guess what, ladies and gentlemen?

[1:59:55.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  Thank you so much. God bless you.
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:25.000]  Well, it's an epic time, ladies and gentlemen, and Mike Adams, investigative journalist, par excellence.
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  We're going to be riding shotgun with us in Gerald Salente's coming up. We're going to get Lee Strayer in the hand on tomorrow.
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:37.000]  He's making a lot of really great points as well. We're taking your phone calls right now. Who's been holding the longest here?
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  That would be, well, we'll go to Brian in Wisconsin, we'll go to Brad in Boston, but right now, Jason in Michigan's been holding the longest. Jason, you're on the air. Welcome, sir.
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  I think when it comes to impeachment, the one thing no one's brought up is Julian Assange. And to me, that's probably the most important. And the reason being is, without Julian Assange, there's no info wars.
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  Alex Jones would probably be in jail right now, along with Rob do, along with Paul Watson. In fact, if I remember correctly, didn't you just release classified information about Obama setting up prison camps within China?
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  Yep, I sure did. The weird thing is, is Julian Assange does it, and he loses everything, everything. You do it, and the money keeps pouring in. Maybe you can explain that.
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  Well, sir, we didn't string your call. You're here, so there's not any nebulous stuff. If you want to accuse me of something, just go ahead and do it. What are you accusing me of?
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  I just gave you facts. You released classified information to your 40 million listeners, and nothing happens to you. Julian Assange did it, which saved your career. It probably saved your life. And for some reason, you're able to release classified information.
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  Listen, I don't like this. I don't like this snake eats his tail. Thanks, sir. I've said that the biggest thing Trump's done bad is tell Julian Assange, or whoever's got the WikiLeaks, he said, release the WikiLeaks, and then they turned the crime into releasing it instead of the crimes Hillary committed.
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  And I have had petitions and mailed them to the White House. We had like 50,000 signatures. We mailed them there. We sent digital copies. I've written hundreds of articles. It's come out in Google documents that they want me off the air because I support Julian Assange and whistleblowers.
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:51.000]  Obama waged unprecedented war on whistleblowers, and on the press, Trump hasn't, except he hasn't helped Assange, and that's wrong. And if Trump could be impeached for anything, and I'm not calling for that, is that he didn't stand up for Assange.
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  Now, just in case you know, I got sued 31 times by Democrat Party law firms, Hillary running it. I have had them try to take my kids away. I get followed around by the New York Times, Pulitzer Prize winning disinfo lady that took down who's the guy that took off Bill O'Reilly.
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  I mean, I've got them all over me and stuff I can't mention on air for security reasons. I have to have security, and you're acting like I'm the assailant. There's press all the time releasing secret stuff. As long as it's illegal what you're exposing or bad, it's good and you're covered.
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  Whistleblower protections are very, very important. And what's happened to Assange getting grabbed in Europe and going to this black hole is wrong, and I've been exposing it from the beginning. So it's not fair, unless you just tune in for the first time, people call and say, you're not covering the private Federal Reserve.
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  What are you talking about? You're not covering Kim Trails. I was one of the first to cover it. So it's just not a fair statement to call in and imply I'm a bad guy. Why am I still on air? Well, they're trying to get me off air.
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:59.000]  And then once I don't have a platform, the plan is to put me in prison. They've said that first they destroy you with a straw man, then they silence you, then they railroad your ass into prison. And sir, did you not know they planted child porn on us?
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  Did you not let me in prison just three months ago? Did you know that, Jason? How come? Hey, Jason, you're nothing but a punk. I'm the real deal. I'm absolutely bonafide. I'm 100% authentic and real. And I've been around longer than Julian Assange.
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  And my audience has kicked total ass. And we brought the entire movement against the globalist and the information war. So you sit there calling up with that BS, you just hate me. You're a leftist. You're a Democrat, aren't you? You hate Trump.
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  Tell me you hate Trump, Jason.
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  Pays for you. Your money.
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:47.000]  Hold on a minute. Notice he wouldn't call in when we said calling and disagree. He's a deceiver. He's a liar. Hey, Jason, I know you want to piss on my grave, brother. I know you want to see me in prison. But God's on my side and the listeners are on my side. We'll see what happens.
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:05:02.000]  You little deceiving rat liar. But it doesn't matter. You called in, you played your fake hand, you're full of crap. I've done nothing but support Assange. So everything you said is a lie. You hate me because you're of your father, the devil. I can smell it.
[2:05:17.000 --> 2:05:32.000]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:48.000]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[2:06:02.000 --> 2:06:23.000]  It's full potential band dot video.
[2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:33.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[2:06:33.000 --> 2:06:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide. Thank you so much for joining us. It was live Monday show.
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:58.000]  Trump has the deep state trying to take him out right now. They're openly saying they're going to kill him. They're going to kill Giuliani on the news. And now coming up next segment, I'm going to play clips of Joy Reid and others fantasizing about how they're going to threaten his cabinet so that they basically remove
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:16.000]  him 22nd amendment or they threaten Trump where he leaves. Also one of his former quote executives, she works in one of his buildings says she thinks he'll resign. So what they're doing is they're telegraphing the message to Trump, give up and we'll let you go make a deal
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:29.000]  with us so that you don't win the next election and so we can discredit everything and discredit the American populace movement and continue rolling forward with the censorship, the open borders, the gun confiscation, the mask is off.
[2:07:29.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  We'll continue with your calls as well. Brad and Brian and Nathan and Will and Kenny and Alex will at least get to those calls in this hour.
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:55.000]  Then Gerald Salante always informative, hard hitting will be in the fourth hour in the war room. Oh and Shroyer then fire powers seven o'clock central with Will Johnson and Tom Papert and others kicking butt.
[2:07:55.000 --> 2:08:07.000]  And again, David night weekday mornings 8am. You can find it all at band.video. The site is exponentially logarithmically growing. Thanks to you word of mouth. Tell folks hey, you want to hear what you're not supposed to hear about the real war going on while the
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:17.000]  censorship is happening, what they don't want you to hear, band.video. So thank you for that and also support the local stations in your area, TV, radio, please tell folks about those.
[2:08:17.000 --> 2:08:27.000]  Mike Adams is an engineer. He also owns one of the largest testing facilities in Texas and one of the largest in the U.S. has a great job there.
[2:08:27.000 --> 2:08:39.000]  He owns a lot of scientific work. He owns Natural News. He's a filmmaker, documentary filmmaker and also author and then publishes multinational and he's an expert on a lot of the things happening with genetic engineering and more.
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  But the reason he joins us now, the reason he joins us today is to get into that big article that he published yesterday at naturalnews.com.
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  U.S. Marine Reserve Units activated for emergency within the United States, close quote, continuing which will and quotes come with little warning, quote, threats in the homeland.
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:13.000]  We are not calling for an end to positive comment on us. That's not troops on the street policing people in the civil authority. The president in an outside rogue group outside of the legislature outside of law tries to remove him as they're now saying they said in the
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:21.000]  Aspen Institute on CNN, we're going to remove him outside of impeachment and Butcher says, how are you going to do that? And they said, just watch.
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:32.000]  So that's illegal. That's dangerous. We did have a debate about this. What happens if they remove Trump? In fact, one of the callers says here, what happens after Trump is removed?
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  Well, we'll go to that call first. But Mike Adams break down here how huge this is. And we've never seen a Marine Corps order like this. It happened four days ago. You're linking your article to the order. This is not a joke.
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:51.000]  It's not a drill. The president says we're in a civil war. He says there is an active coup. We told people this a couple years ago, but now it's the president.
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  I'll say, even the hospital statesman was in the print edition. I saw it and people were telling me about it. Oh, suddenly the whole country's Alex Jones and info wars talk of martial law talk of civil war talk of coups by everybody.
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:15.000]  Well, that's because we're just covering reality. It was already going on. Now it's out in the open. What would you call this critical time and how huge this is, Mike Adams?
[2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:26.000]  It's important to understand that this order talks about these troops of Marine Corps reserve units. ISO civil authorities means in support of civil authorities.
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  So you're absolutely correct when you say this is not an attempt to bypass a Posse cometatus. This is using reserve Marine Corps forces to support civil authorities who will be engaged in a lawful pursuit to shut down those who are engaged in breaking the law.
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:54.000]  So that's step one of this, but I've reached out to my contacts in the military, active military as well as some retired military. And they've told me a couple of interesting things.
[2:10:54.000 --> 2:11:09.000]  Number one, they say that normally these orders have a 120 day window of being active. So if that's true, then what that means is Trump is expecting a hard coup, a kinetic coup within the next 120 days.
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  And that that timeline actually lines up with what we're seeing with the mass hysteria in the media, the calls for killing Trump or impeaching Trump or shiving Rudy Giuliani and so on.
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:27.000]  So there's a there's an amping up that seems to be pointing to a desperate timeline on the part of the Dems.
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:40.000]  We also know that the documents from the from the IG investigation and the DOJ, a G William Barr and so on are expected to be released in the next, perhaps two, maybe three, maybe four weeks on as an outlier.
[2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:53.000]  But within that 120 day window, and it's widely believed by those of us who are in the know here, and I know you believe this as well, that the Dems, the Democrats know many of them are going to go to jail.
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  They will be indicted, they will be criminally charged. Many of them will spend the rest of their lives in prison. When the truth comes out about their FISA warrant court abuse, their collusion, their obstruction of justice, their witness tampering, all the things that they did.
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  But there's one more scenario here that I'll share with you Alex that just came to light when I was talking to my contacts.
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:32.000]  And that is that with the US Marine Corps forces activated, Trump could flip this to invoking the insurrection act, and then reach out and arrest through military police, the traders, the treasonous actors in the United States, who are attempting to carry out a coup.
[2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:48.000]  It might be that the president is hoping that they will try this so that the president can then invoke the insurrection act and send out the Marines to literally hunt down, arrest, and detain these treasonous criminals to face military tribunals.
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  So those are the scenarios that are now being assessed by people who are in the know.
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  Well, let's be clear, if the president knows there's people in the executive branch who are not following orders and will try to organize a coup against the team, that's normally how it works.
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:11.000]  Traders inside the executive working with other groups in the legislature and then with financiers behind it, then the president needs to go after them.
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:25.000]  One of the things that happens in seven days in May with famous Hollywood actors, Burt Lancaster and others, is it's a simulated situation and then having to use the Marines to basically stop the other military from taking over.
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  I'm going from memory on that.
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  Guys, queue up the trailer for seven days in May, came out in the 1960s, because it was actually talk about this going on back then.
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:36.000]  This happens in third world countries all the time, and I want to be clear.
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:37.000]  We don't want a coup.
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:41.000]  President Trump was elected. The coup is illegal.
[2:13:41.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  And so you have to meet an attack with force and a response.
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:48.000]  And so this is good that the president's doing this.
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  The word is he already had the Marines at the highest levels ready.
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:55.000]  He's just taking the gun off safety, hoping they back down and we can move forward.
[2:13:55.000 --> 2:13:57.000]  He doesn't want to hurt the stock market.
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:14:01.000]  He doesn't want to have to have a crisis just to prove that he's dominant over these people.
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  He was elected.
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  They weren't.
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:07.000]  That's why they're saying all these violent things is to embolden others.
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  The Joker movie is a total antifa worship, kill the police, murder all the government people that are conservative, murder the Trump types.
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:19.000]  I mean, they admit they're trying to cause a civil war because they're losing and they're failing.
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:21.000]  So we don't want them to try this.
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:23.000]  That's why I went ahead and told the story.
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:32.000]  I was told by a very close Trump confidant who had dinner with him at Mar-a-Lago right when he was gotten into office.
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:37.000]  I guess it was probably the first trip to Mar-a-Lago and this individual, I'm not going to get into all the details.
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:41.000]  And I wasn't told never tell the story, but I never really told the story.
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  I just mentioned I'd heard this from others.
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  Then I did ask around about this, but Trump is very fatalistic.
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:48.000]  He said, I always wanted to get elected.
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  I always thought I could get elected.
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:51.000]  I didn't want to have to do this unless I had to.
[2:14:51.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  But if they try to take me out by impeachment or whatever, I'll go through it.
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:57.000]  I'll let them have the trial.
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  They removed me.
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  Then that's what happens.
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  I'm going to put everything on this, my name, everything because these people just can't be allowed to run this beautiful country in the ground.
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:12.000]  But he said, if they try a coup and if they try to remove me outside of law, I'm going to call out the Marines and surround the White House.
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  And then we're going to arrest their asses.
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:17.000]  So he's very fatalistic and I was told very fatalistic.
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:20.000]  And by fatalistic, he doesn't want to die or fail.
[2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:24.000]  He's peddled the medal beyond confident, committed that he's going to follow this course.
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  So I think it's good news to put that out.
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:28.000]  The president's not going to resign, folks.
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:31.000]  He's not going to resign until Hillary can slide in and get into office.
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  Not going to happen. Don't hold your breath.
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:44.000]  And Alex, watch for simultaneous activation of the terror cells that were brought into this country, relocated under the Obama administration, actually shipped to the cities to await orders.
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  And they were brought in with the illegal migrant caravan.
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:48.000]  So there are terror cells ready to be activated.
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:49.000]  By the way, that's confirmed.
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:51.000]  You'll have the floor when we come back, Mike Adams.
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:52.000]  I forgot about that.
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:53.000]  That's so critical.
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:15:57.000]  Also, they have the Hezbollah cells, the MS-13, all God's children that Pelosi talks about.
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:15:59.000]  This isn't a game. This isn't a joke.
[2:15:59.000 --> 2:16:01.000]  This is the globalist making their move on America.
[2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:30.000]  Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[2:16:31.000 --> 2:16:32.000]  We'll be right back.
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:09.000]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:14.000]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:22.000]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[2:17:22.000 --> 2:17:30.000]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:41.000]  Not a security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.

[2:20:16.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live. I promise we're going to your phone calls for everybody holding next segment. My cat is riding shotgun with us, researcher, engineer, naturalnews.com and Alex Jones with newswords.com and Band Dot Video.
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:56.000]  Again, to explain how this coup works, these private multinationals that have taken control of the national security apparatus have openly tried to intimidate everybody in the media, everybody in government.
[2:20:56.000 --> 2:21:04.000]  Tell them that when Trump gets taken out, you're going to get it too. So that's why so many people pay lip service against Trump because they're scared.
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  Just like the polls show, people won't tell people they're for Trump, but when they actually vote, they vote for Trump. It's the same thing. It's that little secret.
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:20.000]  Well, it's important to not be secret about it. It's important to be out in the open about it and realize the score, what we're facing here.
[2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:34.000]  There are a lot of powerful, evil forces are right against America. But if we ever expose those forces and if people realize who those forces are, folks are going to choose the right way. Prosperity, justice, freedom, it's all waiting.
[2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:45.000]  And so let's talk about the way they go kinetic and how they're preparing to go kinetic. They're testing their perch. They're testing the water right now, the level not seen the last three years, not seen since this began.
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:51.000]  And why you think the time is so critical and why Trump's activated the Marines in case they try to take them out?
[2:21:51.000 --> 2:22:04.000]  Well, it's critical to understand that if once they pull the trigger on this kinetic coup or hard coup against Trump, as we're calling it, this will be accompanied by many other plans that have been put in place since Barack Obama.
[2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:17.000]  The Obama administration installed terror cells all across America. Former President Obama is, I believe, a terrorist against America. He actively sought to provide nuclear weapons to Iran.
[2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:24.000]  He actively sought to share U.S. technology with China and Iran by arranging for the capture of a U.S. drone.
[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  He responded the whole Arab Spring and destabilized all of that. He means business.
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:37.000]  And his plans are still in place, and he is still their commander-in-chief. So there are terror cells waiting for an order from Obama.
[2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:45.000]  And when the coup goes down, you are, I predict, you're going to see attempts to sabotage the power grid by these terror cells.
[2:22:45.000 --> 2:22:54.000]  So there are going to be local grid down situations. You're going to see attempts to sabotage military bases, especially in places like California.
[2:22:54.000 --> 2:23:01.000]  And those bases could be hit with all kinds of things, including small-scale EMP weapons as well.
[2:23:01.000 --> 2:23:10.000]  So you're going to see chaos across America. And they want this chaos. They want to cause a market crash, no matter what happens to the impeachment outcome.
[2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:15.000]  The Democrats and the deep state know if they can crash the market, then they can roll out a whole new narrative.
[2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:20.000]  Oh, well, Trump survived impeachment. But look, the economy has gone to pot.
[2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:29.000]  The biggest movie in years, Joker, is openly about Antifa. Paul Watson went to it, felt physically ill. The darkness left with him for days.
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:37.000]  It is an Antifa, rise up, murder police, burn buildings, kill everybody. It's beautiful to be a psychotic. It's meant to cause mass shootings.
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:39.000]  I mean, they're really trying to do this.
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:46.000]  Well, and don't forget that in California now, and Breitbart is in a big war with, I think, the Los Angeles Police Department right now,
[2:23:46.000 --> 2:23:51.000]  in Los Angeles, they will not hire conservatives to be police officers, but they will hire gang members.
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:58.000]  So you're actually seeing an MS-13 infiltration of law enforcement in Los Angeles and perhaps other cities across California.
[2:23:58.000 --> 2:24:07.000]  This is consistent with what Obama did to bring terrorists into America and have them infiltrate, in fact, law enforcement, and California itself run by...
[2:24:07.000 --> 2:24:10.000]  Oh, New Mexico's hiring illegal aliens to be police.
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  Oh, yeah, right. So this is happening across the board. They are waiting for an activation signal, and that activation signal will coincide with a hard coup attempt.
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:30.000]  And of course, CNN will stage this, or they will be there to film this being staged, exactly as they staged the raid on Roger Stone.
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:34.000]  CNN was tipped off so that they could make Roger Stone look guilty on camera.
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:43.000]  Or during the Arab Spring, the CNN reporters are saying how wonderful it was that freedom was taking over, but they were murdering and killing Christians and others en masse.
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  Exactly right. But of course, CNN and the Democrats, they vastly underestimate the will of the people.
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:58.000]  So we're talking about bikers for Trump, truckers for Trump, even union workers for Trump, former law enforcement, former military, veterans for Trump,
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:10.000]  just armed citizens for Trump, for America. It's a massive contingent of people who are just not going to stand by and let their country be steamrolled and watch Hillary Clinton be installed as a president.
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:20.000]  You know this scenario, Alex. If they get rid of Trump and Pence, Nancy Pelosi becomes president. Nancy Pelosi appoints Hillary as the vice president, and then Pelosi resigns, making Hillary the president.
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:25.000]  Their plan is to install Hillary Clinton as president by the end of this year. That's their plan.
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:32.000]  And let's explain why she wouldn't run. That way, all the corruption isn't brought up. That way, all the other candidates chew themselves up. That way, an impeachment begins.
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  Trump's quote in trouble. And then in the slides, Hillary Clinton, she's been collecting the money. She's been telling her underlings she's still going to run. This is a fact.
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:43.000]  And now it's all over the news that she doesn't tend to run.
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  And if they succeed in this plan, by the way, and I think they will fail, but in their minds they think they will succeed, then she doesn't have to campaign. She will be installed as president.
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  That's what they hope to do. They don't even need her to go to any debates. They're going to install an authoritarian dictatorship, or at least they think they will.
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:11.000]  And from that point on, it's mass executions of all Trump supporters. You and me and all of us will be on the hit list, the death squad list.
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:20.000]  That's exactly what will happen because there's zero tolerance in the minds of leftists for the existence of Christians, conservatives, or Trump supporters, or gun owners, for that matter.
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  It's going to be nationwide gun confiscation, mass death squads. They're going to take down any opposition to Democrats, and they're going to try to rule. This is their plan again. I think they will fail.
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:36.000]  But their plan is to rule America forevermore as basically communist China rules over China. That's their plan.
[2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:45.000]  China is the model for the way the Democrats want to rule America. So what's stopping them, of course, is the Second Amendment, veterans, patriotism, common sense.
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:54.000]  But that's why when they then carry out the attack, if anybody resists, they're going to go, oh, it's the white nationalist resisting everybody who's brown, shoot the white nationalist.
[2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:57.000]  You can see the whole admitted preparation for this.
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  Yep. And this is why you've seen deep state elements declare white nationalism as being terrorism recently. They're setting the stage for the narrative that you just described.
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:17.000]  And they know exactly what groups that UT and every other university that control Antifa, they're just the decoys, ready with hit list, ready with their quote A teams.
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:23.000]  And of course, they're pathetic, but they're just the front people for real hit teams that are going to be coming. We're not trying to scare folks.
[2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  This is the globalist attempt to take down a country couldn't be taken down as powerful of us from without, but it can be done from within.
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:39.000]  We're going to go to break soon. We'll go to calls. We come back. I'm going to play an MSNBC clip where they say, oh, we're going to remove Trump, put Pelosi in.
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  Then we have a quote, former Trump executive saying, oh, I think he'll resign. They're putting all this out there.
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:58.000]  Mike, how do we reach out to the president and others and Congress and say, hey, hold the line. Don't back down to the intimidation that we've got to understand that if we give into this, it means red terror.
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:28:05.000]  Well, we do exactly what we're doing right now. You stay alive. You stay on the air. You stay successful. You keep growing your network as you're doing.
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  It's extraordinary that in the face of all these attacks and all these attempts to shut you down, you continue to grow and gain support.
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:19.000]  And, you know, that caller earlier that was saying that you're bad because you're still alive. That's absurd. You're fighting like crazy to stay alive and stay on the air.
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  And I am too. And just the fact that we are still here is a miracle that probably means God is literally protecting us because this is an important mission for all of humanity.
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:41.000]  You know, like you're you're only innocent. If you're dead, that doesn't make any sense. No, we're alive. We're fighting. We're fighting for America. And more people are joining us in this effort because we will not be steamrolled by these
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:41.000]  Exactly.
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:29:03.000]  It's like when some bully starts a fight with you and you kick his ass, you go, wow, I did that. Folks got to believe we can really change the world. Of course, M4s is real. But that was just a leftist calling in to put in doubt. He wasn't being legitimate.
[2:29:03.000 --> 2:29:18.000]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me. You don't know me and we'll never meet. I had a problem like you once. I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[2:29:18.000 --> 2:29:37.000]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me. If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the national treatment advisors.

[2:31:01.000 --> 2:31:12.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[2:31:12.000 --> 2:31:16.000]  Band Dot Video
[2:31:16.000 --> 2:31:34.000]  No, it's easier than ever to have Band Dot Video on your iPhone. Simply go to Band Dot Video with your Safari browser. Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen. When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen. It will then ask you to name the app. I suggest Band Dot Video.

The Globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[2:31:48.000 --> 2:31:58.000]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the Share buttons below. On your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want, be sure and share Band Dot Video.
[2:31:58.000 --> 2:32:04.000]  Band Dot Video
[2:32:04.000 --> 2:32:27.000]  The Gauntlet has been thrown down. Every major Democrat candidate has come out and said they want to confiscate all semi-auto firearms, and now Buddha Judge has come out and said that it's about political power. That's why they want the guns. Well, finally they're being honest, because all their lies haven't got them to the point they want.
[2:32:27.000 --> 2:32:42.000]  So now they're just trying to normalize all this tyranny. It shows what incredible followers these people are. The Globalists know they're not going to get this without a civil war, and they know that the minions trying to carry this out are not going to be in a good position in that civil war.
[2:32:42.000 --> 2:32:58.000]  It's up to us to understand the big picture, to carry the fight to the enemy in the information war before they can kick off a hot civil war. That's our mission. If you choose to accept it, so please spread the word about m4wars.com.
[2:32:58.000 --> 2:33:16.000]  And take advantage of store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points, 50% off. It's about to end at m4wars.com.
[2:33:16.000 --> 2:33:28.000]  Where are the clowns? Send in the clowns.
[2:33:28.000 --> 2:33:42.000]  And who are the clowns? They're all the disheveled, drug addict leftists who were told they were supposed to be the ruling class for the left that sold them worthless college degrees and taught them there was no God and the family wasn't good.
[2:33:42.000 --> 2:33:55.000]  But now they go out and kill some rich people, kill some white people. If they hate America, if they engage in mass shootings, they'll be movie stars, they'll be good guys, they'll be heroes. Really, all you'll do is burn down your neighborhood.
[2:33:55.000 --> 2:34:08.000]  And it's the ultra-rich that sold America out who are actually funding a class warfare system. And America's not buying it. So they produce more movies. They make more Netflix shows. They make more jokers to do it all.
[2:34:08.000 --> 2:34:17.000]  But you know what happened on the way? Epic times. I remember reading it in the early 2000s. Falun Gong got involved, set it up. They were being killed, having their organs taken in China.
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:29.000]  So some Chinese Americans got together and they set up the epic times. And then just six, seven years ago, they started to do multimedia. You know, they're in the top ten media worldwide for videos.
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:40.000]  Billions and billions of views a year. And so they gave them full wars. Well, now the State Department would have left us still in it. And NBC and CNN want the epic times taken off the air.
[2:34:40.000 --> 2:34:44.000]  Why, they're supporting the people in Hong Kong. You can't have that. Look at the rockets.
[2:34:44.000 --> 2:34:51.000]  Why, Communist China said, you apologize for criticizing us. We're saying Hong Kong deserves freedom. And they said, you're right. We'll do what you say.
[2:34:51.000 --> 2:35:01.000]  Send in the clowns. But epic times put all this together about a year ago.
[2:35:01.000 --> 2:35:13.000]  And it shows the whole spy gate, Brennan, Clapper, Hillary, how they set it up, how Obama did it, all the fake spies, all the fake info, how it's all a giant fraud with the media, the insurance policy.
[2:35:13.000 --> 2:35:22.000]  Now, zoom in on that. It's all right there. That's free, by the way, on their website. They're not paying me to promote this. It's good to see real journalism.
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:35.000]  You know, they reversed engineered it all just like we did, but they made a nice graph out of it. You can find that online. The epic times investigation into the insurance policy, the one into spy gate and the dossier networks.
[2:35:35.000 --> 2:35:49.000]  It's got them all right there. How they carried it out. How they did it. Now, these same networks got a book out called Information War, put up with the CIA talking about how well they've lost the war against the American people.
[2:35:49.000 --> 2:35:57.000]  But they can censor and take it back. They actually say that. You know, they are losing the war and they're going to lose no matter what they do because you're scum.
[2:35:57.000 --> 2:36:05.000]  You're trying to say, where are the traders? Where are the outsiders? Where are the people that hate America? No, it's you and everybody knows it. You can't even shut your fat mouths.
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:13.000]  In between foaming at the mouth, wanting to kill already born babies and promoting pedophilia and devil worship and everything else you're into. It's your disease, psychotics.
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:28.000]  Now you tell us your kill babies after they're born. It's incredible. Mike Adams is here with us. I want to play this clip. Get his take and then take calls on Joy Reed. I'm not going to play Trump's quote former executive. She ran one of his buildings going, I think he'll step down.
[2:36:28.000 --> 2:36:43.000]  He's not for real. If you just go after him, he'll resign. If you just stock the impeachment. So that's all what they're putting out. And we'll put Pelosi or Hillary. They'll fix it for us.
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:48.000]  Here's Joy Reed having a fantasy event with her panel.
[2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:58.000]  How does anything change if Donald Trump is no longer at the top of this sort of, you know, web of corruption, but Pence is then.
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:12.000]  I'm sorry, start it over. Start over from the beginning. This web of corruption. He's surrounded by cowards. The web is you. Perfect psychological projection. Sorry, start it over.
[2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:24.000]  How does anything change if Donald Trump is no longer at the top of this sort of, you know, web of corruption, but start it over. Start it over. I gotta say this. I'm serious.
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:35.000]  You watch all the now they say we've got to get everyone below it. All the nationalists, all the patriots, the folks you couldn't intimidate. See, where you were always coming after our gods, you were always coming after our kids.
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:45.000]  You're a bunch of knuckle-draggers, but you don't like civilization. You didn't build the country. You're globalist. And so now you're coming after us. Here it is.
[2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:56.000]  How does anything change if Donald Trump is no longer at the top of this sort of, you know, web of corruption, but Pence is then at the top.
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:38:07.000]  Well, I think a couple of things happen. One, the American voters will actually see, and I remain sort of a Pollyanna that I believe facts ultimately matter.
[2:38:07.000 --> 2:38:18.000]  And that, in fact, even 20 Republican senators might come to their senses and say, the country is at risk if I don't vote this way. And the facts are clear.
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:28.000]  And I think in this case, we have very clear facts. There is, and Liz and I talked about this before the show, you could impeach Pence first.
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:41.000]  The problem is that Donald Trump then has to name his replacement. But I think that maybe a deal could be struck where he was told if you don't make a replacement, then Nancy Pelosi does become president.
[2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:52.000]  And so you are going to be impeached and convicted. You need to make this replacement so that the proper party contains remains in power.
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:39:05.000]  The proper party remains in power. That's a total coup. By threatening people, we could make a deal where it's Nancy Pelosi is obviously on a bunch of amphetamines.
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:14.000]  You can barely talk. Mike Adams, I want to go to these calls, but only patiently. But these people are power men. They're like pretending to be soldiers.
[2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:26.000]  They're like pretending to be rulers. But really, it's just a bunch of fat old women on drugs, most of them, you can tell, up there about how they're going to dominate us and rule everyone and overthrow elections.
[2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:35.000]  I mean, this is their plan. They're telling us, wow, talk about dangerous. I mean, I guess we deserve to be conquered by this if we roll over to it.
[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:38.000]  And her tricom handlers, what do you want to say to this skexie?
[2:39:38.000 --> 2:39:46.000]  Well, they're admitting their plan that we've described, which is to install Hillary Clinton as president by first making Nancy Pelosi president.
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:52.000]  And you watch these women, they are delusional, they're living in a bubble world and they're gaslighting each other.
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:40:03.000]  That's, you know, if facts matter, as she said, if facts matter, the Democrats are done for forever. If facts matter, the deep state is over because it will be drained if facts matter.
[2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:14.000]  You know, the facts are on our side. The nation is on our side. We are on the side of America. All of those people that you just saw, they are opposed to every principle of this nation.
[2:40:14.000 --> 2:40:23.000]  And many of them are deliberately functioning as enemies of the people of America. And they will probably face a day of reckoning for that, I would imagine.
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:25.000]  So that's my take on that.
[2:40:25.000 --> 2:40:31.000]  I totally agree. And the fact that they're in their own little bubbles and nothing against people that live in city areas.
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:35.000]  But you go downtown, Austin or downtown Manhattan or whatever, especially younger. I mean, they're like bubble people.
[2:40:35.000 --> 2:40:41.000]  They don't know how to fix a tire. They don't even know how the world works, but they all just live in their own BS.
[2:40:41.000 --> 2:40:48.000]  And these globalists walk around amongst all these zombies and feel powerful. Look, you know, humans are finished. No, we're not finished.
[2:40:48.000 --> 2:40:56.000]  America's not done. And the globalists had a chance if they kind of ignored Trump, tried to co-opt him, told him what he wanted to hear, went along with him for a lot of it.
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:41:01.000]  They could have waited it out. The fact that they're having a big war with us right up front, I think derails them forever.
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:04.000]  I mean, it's going to be rough on you and I and the listeners and everybody.
[2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:08.000]  But you know, I think in the end, the way they're acting is going to make it a lot worse.
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:12.000]  What happens if they kill Trump? Doesn't that make it worse if they kill Trump too? For them?
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:18.000]  Oh, absolutely. Then it becomes an activation of patriots all across America instantly.
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:25.000]  That's why they will be very reluctant to try to do that. They want to get Trump through a process that pretends to be legal.
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:32.000]  Remember, there has been no vote for impeachment proceedings. There are no real subpoenas being issued by Congress. It's all fake. It's gaslighting. It's theater.
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:36.000]  Everything the left does is theater. And so they're just rolling out the same theater again.
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:41.000]  You made that point on the phone the other day. I mean, it's just like all the fake me too and all the fake stuff with Kavanaugh.
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:48.000]  And then they just admit the first guy wasn't even real. Now this second one, oh, that's not real. It's all just crap because it can never stand up a scrutiny.
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:50.000]  It's just made up.
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:42:00.000]  Remember, one thing I said to you privately, which I'll share here is that there will be an infinite number of whistleblowers just like there are an infinite number of genders because it's all make believe.
[2:42:00.000 --> 2:42:03.000]  It's all delusional. They're fabricating everything.
[2:42:03.000 --> 2:42:08.000]  Why are they promoting? I saw the Joker, the whole thing worships Antifa and worships mental illness is sexy.
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:14.000]  Is that just because Hollywood is so diseased and drugged out that they're just projecting their mental illness on us?
[2:42:14.000 --> 2:42:23.000]  Yes, exactly. Yeah, they're projecting what they are. I mean, many of these people in Hollywood, the vast majority are not only extreme substance abusers like heroin and so on,
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:28.000]  but also, of course, child traffickers, child molesters, child rapists, you know, some of them have child.
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:33.000]  Do you want to see it on the airplane with that whole suitcase of all those high power drugs?
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:41.000]  Yeah, yeah. So these people just projecting their mental illness and hoping to sweep America into their twisted world of death and destruction and suffering.
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:44.000]  That's what Democrats stand for. They're the party of death.
[2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:46.000]  This could not be a more epic site.
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:51.000]  Mike Adams, naturalnews.com. Your phone calls, I promise. The next couple of segments then he's taken over.
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:42:58.000]  Gerald Salente, but I promise I'm going to your calls. Bam, bam, bam with Mike Adams. Stay with us. This is just so historical. I just can't even believe it.
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:02.000]  You can cut the suspense with a knife and this isn't a movie.
[2:43:04.000 --> 2:43:08.000]  Do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance is wrong, trying to fact check the present?
[2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:20.000]  The deceptive, humpy, dumpy troll known as Brian Stelter and his little weasel minion, Oliver Darcy, have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air into censor us.
[2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:24.000]  And of course, he famously said along with many others that Trump is the Info Wars president.
[2:43:24.000 --> 2:43:32.000]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the Info Wars president.
[2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:41.000]  And you know what is true? Our audience of activists, our guests, our crew and my drive and your drive has brought Trump to the White House and other nationalists to power around the world.
[2:43:41.000 --> 2:43:47.000]  And now Trump's openly coming out declaring war on these globalist tyrants and their unelected anti-human tyrannies.
[2:43:47.000 --> 2:43:52.000]  So this is a day of great victory and I salute you all but now I'm the thick of the fight.
[2:43:52.000 --> 2:44:03.000]  So infowarstore.com for products you need, massive sales now so we can continue on to the future and give these bastards one hell of a fight right until the end until we've defeated them.
[2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:07.000]  My friends, I've seen a lot of Donald Trump just like you have.
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:21.000]  And my goodness, yesterday's press conference, when they came in on him with all their garbage, the foreign reporters, the U.S. reporters, these little political sell-outs, these whores, he just tore them to bits.
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:27.000]  And it's one thing to hear it if you're radio listeners, it's powerful, but if you see it, it's all at band.video.
[2:44:27.000 --> 2:44:31.000]  You've got the full press conference. We've got my boil down of how epic it is.
[2:44:31.000 --> 2:44:38.000]  It's all at band.video and I just, you've got to share this with people because Trump was hitting on all 45 cylinders.
[2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:41.000]  This was amazing and he turned the nitrous oxide on top of it.
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:51.000]  So info wars, America, Trump, all of us, incredible things are happening and we're sharing the ideas that are going to defeat the tyrants at band.video.
[2:44:51.000 --> 2:44:57.000]  And I got to tell you, we've done great video work, we've done great films, we've done so much, but websites are not our thing.
[2:44:57.000 --> 2:45:02.000]  Well, now they are. I'm so proud of band.video, folks. Check it out. There's a lot of new features band.video.
[2:45:28.000 --> 2:45:35.000]  But at the 11th hour, 58th minute, the American people put a populist in power and it's happening all over the world.
[2:45:35.000 --> 2:45:42.000]  So great things are happening, but the enemy is striking back. They're very serious with this impeachment plan.
[2:45:42.000 --> 2:45:49.000]  It has bipartisan support and I'm telling you, President Trump needs our prayers and info wars needs your prayers and support.
[2:45:49.000 --> 2:45:52.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are trying to shut us down.
[2:45:52.000 --> 2:45:57.000]  But right now it's easier than ever to financially support us while getting great products at the same time.

[2:46:39.000 --> 2:46:48.000]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.

[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:48.000]  Let's go to Brian in Wisconsin. Thanks for holding her on the ear.
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:57.000]  Thanks for having me on, Alex. Start off, I just touched base. I'll meet the press episode there I saw with Ron Johnson and Chuck Todd.
[2:48:57.000 --> 2:49:01.000]  Ron Johnson is a senator from Wisconsin.
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:09.000]  Chuck Todd started screaming at him saying, you must believe the FBI and CIA, Trump's a traitor, he must have. It's just all made up. None of it's even true.
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:21.000]  I spent my morning calling and thanking Ron Johnson for doing that. It showed what the truth is behind this call with the Ukrainian president. It also showed the corruption of the media and the bias.
[2:49:21.000 --> 2:49:29.000]  But on another point, you guys were just talking about Civil War and possibly here. What's going on in Iraq right now?
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:40.000]  You've got tens of thousands dead. You've got just absolute bad luck as the Shiites and Sunnis and others. The whole world's going crazy right now.
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:47.000]  You've got Pakistan and India threatening nuclear war with each other. Most experts agree. That's how the world could end was between those two.
[2:49:47.000 --> 2:49:51.000]  It's what I'm saying. There's times in history when just so much happens.
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:49:59.000]  Our government's watching real close what's going on over in Iraq right now. I hear curfews. I hear numerous dead, numerous injured, right?
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:05.000]  I mean, you think they're not watching what's going to happen there? The deep states got their ear to the ground on that.
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:13.000]  Oh, you're absolutely right. I mean, look, as above so below, and you've got Revolution and war and Civil War and killings and happening everywhere.
[2:50:13.000 --> 2:50:21.000]  You've got globalists being thrown out of office everywhere. You've got Turkey invading Syria right now.
[2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:27.000]  I mean, I've been focusing on the left trying to overthrow the president, but you're right. All hell's breaking loose. Thanks for the call.
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:32.000]  Mike, you're a geopolitical wonk yourself. What do you make of all this movement?
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:40.000]  Well, real quick, the deep state in America has been the exporter of death and destruction and suffering all around the world.
[2:50:40.000 --> 2:50:47.000]  The best way to help the world is to help Trump survive this and drain the swamp. Then the world will benefit as a result of America being strong and free.
[2:50:47.000 --> 2:50:48.000]  That's my short answer.
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:54.000]  And he's definitely trying to stabilize the planet and leave the globalist model of destabilization.
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:51:03.000]  Absolutely. Look, Trump is humanity's last hope, not just America, but really for a free world because Communist China is rising.
[2:51:03.000 --> 2:51:09.000]  Look at their nuclear weapons. They're hypersonic missiles. They're aircraft carrier factories now. They're going to be threatening the whole world.
[2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:15.000]  Trump needs to be strong. America needs to be strong as a sovereign nation, not part of some globalist cabal.
[2:51:15.000 --> 2:51:19.000]  Absolutely. Let's talk to Dennis in Virginia. You're on the air, Dennis.
[2:51:19.000 --> 2:51:23.000]  Hey, guys. Hi, Alex and Mike. You guys are awesome today. Great show.
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:24.000]  Thank you.
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:29.000]  What it's called about the left, it seems as though they keep pushing it further and further.
[2:51:29.000 --> 2:51:38.000]  You know, I'm hoping Trump does do something with all these threats and I guess him, his family, it just goes on and on.
[2:51:38.000 --> 2:51:43.000]  Now, the question is, didn't they used to arrest people for threatening the president and his family?
[2:51:43.000 --> 2:51:47.000]  I mean, they keep at it because there's no consequences so far.
[2:51:47.000 --> 2:51:54.000]  Well, again, they're trying to say they're going to kill everybody and kill the president on TV, Phil Mudd, hoping somebody does something.
[2:51:54.000 --> 2:51:57.000]  Because when they're calling for martial law and civil war, he goes, hey, that's civil war.
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:51:59.000]  They go, oh, impeach him. He said civil war.
[2:51:59.000 --> 2:52:07.000]  So they're trying to push Trump into something. It's just at a certain point when they've committed all these crimes, push comes to shove.
[2:52:07.000 --> 2:52:11.000]  And notice too that the tech giants ban people.
[2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:13.000]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[2:52:13.000 --> 2:52:20.000]  No, it's okay, Mike. Yeah, that's what they want. I think they keep wanting to push it. And Mike, you touched on it earlier about Trump's base.
[2:52:20.000 --> 2:52:26.000]  I mean, I think it's larger than they think and it keeps getting bigger and bigger, thanks to guys like you.
[2:52:26.000 --> 2:52:30.000]  Well, that's it. They can't intimidate you to back off the American people.
[2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:33.000]  The more they push, the more it awakens people.
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:39.000]  And the globalists are in such echo chambers. I don't think they realize that. Mike, or do you think they do?
[2:52:39.000 --> 2:52:45.000]  Well, yeah, they do realize that. But the point I was going to make is that the tech giants consider hate to be conservative ideas.
[2:52:45.000 --> 2:52:53.000]  But when leftists or even media personalities directly threaten the president and call for violence and killings and executions, that's not considered hate by the left.
[2:52:53.000 --> 2:52:57.000]  That's just considered correct. That's the way the world should be in their twisted view.
[2:52:57.000 --> 2:52:58.000]  Absolutely.
[2:52:58.000 --> 2:52:59.000]  That's why those people aren't banned.
[2:52:59.000 --> 2:53:01.000]  Anything else, Dennis?
[2:53:01.000 --> 2:53:04.000]  No, just a quick plug on that X3. That's some good stuff, Alex.
[2:53:04.000 --> 2:53:08.000]  I've been using it for about a month and a half, almost two months, and I can really tell it different.
[2:53:08.000 --> 2:53:10.000]  Thank you, sir. I really appreciate you.
[2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:16.000]  Yeah, X3 is probably better than X2, but everybody likes X2 because it's the pure deep breath crystal type.
[2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:22.000]  But I've talked to some scientists and medical doctors and people, and they said, listen, some people can't absorb pure eutonic iodine.
[2:53:22.000 --> 2:53:28.000]  Now, a lot of folks can't absorb the other iodines, but the three together is something that's more holistic
[2:53:28.000 --> 2:53:31.000]  and that overall is better.
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:35.000]  So it's tri-iodine, m4store.com, 100% reviews.
[2:53:35.000 --> 2:53:39.000]  And it's what I give my children instead of the X2, which is a lot stronger.
[2:53:39.000 --> 2:53:40.000]  We go, wait, this is stronger.
[2:53:40.000 --> 2:53:44.000]  I know, different strokes, different folks. Everybody's bodies are different.
[2:53:44.000 --> 2:53:46.000]  But believe me, iodine is the missing link.
[2:53:46.000 --> 2:53:49.000]  Mike's got some great iodine over at naturalnews.com as well.
[2:53:49.000 --> 2:53:51.000]  Okay, let's keep going to calls.
[2:53:51.000 --> 2:53:53.000]  We see Will and Orga's been holding a long time.
[2:53:53.000 --> 2:53:55.000]  Another caller was just holding a long time. He just hung up.
[2:53:55.000 --> 2:53:57.000]  We'll go to Will and Alex now.
[2:53:57.000 --> 2:54:01.000]  Will and Oregon, thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:54:01.000 --> 2:54:02.000]  Hey, Alex, how's it going?
[2:54:02.000 --> 2:54:04.000]  Good, sir. Thank you for holding. Go ahead.
[2:54:04.000 --> 2:54:08.000]  Good. First off, I just want to go ahead and say to you that I'm about to X2.
[2:54:08.000 --> 2:54:12.000]  My family takes it. I have my, you know, say, take no into pregnant.
[2:54:12.000 --> 2:54:15.000]  My daughter is just a beautiful, bright young thing.
[2:54:15.000 --> 2:54:18.000]  Really appreciate everything you guys do.
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:19.000]  Thank you.
[2:54:19.000 --> 2:54:22.000]  I just want to say, man, I've just been thinking about it.
[2:54:22.000 --> 2:54:27.000]  I've been listening to you for about 15 years and just really giving me a lot of anxiety.
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:33.000]  I think that the divide in this country is just like beyond the point of reconciliation.
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:40.000]  You know, so it's pretty, pretty scary to think about the way things are going to unfold.
[2:54:40.000 --> 2:54:43.000]  Sorry, I've been thinking about what's safe for a long time.
[2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:45.000]  Think about how far we've come in 15 years.
[2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:47.000]  Nobody knew the Federal Reserve was private 98%.
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:49.000]  Nobody knew about the New World Order.
[2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:51.000]  That was a good theory. It's all out in the open now.
[2:54:51.000 --> 2:54:55.000]  That's why the globalists are pushing so hard is because they're coming to the end of the line.
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:54:57.000]  Yeah, man, I totally agree.
[2:54:57.000 --> 2:55:03.000]  You know what? My brother woke me up and it's just been a process of trying to get people information, you know.
[2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:08.000]  And it's all you doing word of mouth is changing the world and bypassing big tech censorship.
[2:55:08.000 --> 2:55:14.000]  Yeah. And the other thing I wanted to comment on is just about your encouraging people to get into action.
[2:55:14.000 --> 2:55:20.000]  Is there anywhere or is it something you guys could create something to show like I'm in Oregon, you know?
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:22.000]  So we got Ron White and that stuff.
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:26.000]  And I just would like to be able to get like some bullet points on things that can prompt people about.
[2:55:26.000 --> 2:55:30.000]  Well, there's a four minute promo. I haven't aired yet. It's been on the website. I forget the name of it.
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:34.000]  We might air it before Salante comes on, but it gets into how to take action.
[2:55:34.000 --> 2:55:40.000]  We have action at M4 Wars. We can send any videos, but just go out to public events, politicians are at.
[2:55:40.000 --> 2:55:43.000]  Go to city councils, anything that's on TV and talk about these issues.
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:48.000]  Just get out there and get a buzz going. Call Congress, call Talk Radio, call C-Span.
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:51.000]  You can call C-Span and talk to a couple hundred thousand people.
[2:55:51.000 --> 2:55:55.000]  You don't have to save the world yourself. Just get the ball rolling. God bless you.
[2:55:55.000 --> 2:55:58.000]  Mike, what are some examples of what people can do?
[2:55:58.000 --> 2:56:05.000]  Well, it's like you said, is sharing these sources of information since we've all been blacklisted by the search engines and the social media platforms.
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:09.000]  And it's really about promoting the alternative platforms like band.video.
[2:56:09.000 --> 2:56:12.000]  I mean, I'm so thrilled that you have that platform.
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:20.000]  I want to be clear. If something's blacklisted, folks, that's what you got to spread. If it's black, that means they want it in the dark.
[2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:25.000]  That means what's black is what's good. Get the stuff they want to cover up out. It's very simple.
[2:56:25.000 --> 2:56:32.000]  That's right. And I just want to say your team invited me to upload videos to band.video very soon.
[2:56:32.000 --> 2:56:37.000]  We're doing some special exclusive reports just for band.video. That'll be in just a few weeks. So that's coming.
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:45.000]  Well, Mike, your work is all incredible. We embed your videos and in most our stories. And so I'm very honored to have you and other great contributors going to be coming on board at band.video.
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:51.000]  We post our stuff over at Brighton. Again, it's all, as you know, a team effort. And I love the fact that you've been so team oriented.
[2:56:51.000 --> 2:56:54.000]  Well, you've been coming on the show, what, 15 years or so?
[2:56:54.000 --> 2:56:57.000]  Well, I don't know if it's that long, but I tell you what.
[2:56:57.000 --> 2:57:03.000]  How long have you been? I don't know. It's been a long time. I mean, I've been in these studios 12, 13 years and you've been on at least that whole time.
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:10.000]  Well, it's been so long that when I first came on your show, I was a vegan. Imagine that.
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:22.000]  So, you know, things have changed. I've learned, learned a lot more about food. And today I'll eat good southern Texas barbecue with the superfoods that help protect you against any, you know, burn fascia.
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:26.000]  I should not give you more brain power. I mean, all the studies show, you know, brain's got bigger for me than me.
[2:57:26.000 --> 2:57:31.000]  What I know now is how to eat healthy and still enjoy life at the same time. That's the key right there.
[2:57:31.000 --> 2:57:34.000]  You have done well, Lord Vader. Let's take a few more calls. I know you've got to go.
[2:57:34.000 --> 2:57:41.000]  And then coming up, I'll introduce Gerald Salente in the fourth hour. Bottom line, folks, we're in an incredible historic crossroads.
[2:57:41.000 --> 2:57:45.000]  We're in a fighting position. Thanks to you. We're all in this together.
[2:57:45.000 --> 2:57:50.000]  Is that, guys, will you print me Cicero on the Trader? That's what it's for. I'm going to...
[2:57:50.000 --> 2:57:53.000]  And the man in the arena. Print me those, please.
[2:57:54.000 --> 2:57:58.000]  I know most of you realize this, but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly.
[2:57:58.000 --> 2:58:02.000]  You are just as important as I am or the rest of the crew at Info Wars.
[2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:07.000]  And we are the individuals that have done the research to understand the Globalist Battle Plan.
[2:58:07.000 --> 2:58:10.000]  And we know how to take them down. That's why they're so upset.
[2:58:10.000 --> 2:58:15.000]  Think how far we've come together. You know, even if we were losing, we'd all still keep fighting on,
[2:58:15.000 --> 2:58:22.000]  because it's the right thing to do against the truly satanic forces of the New World Order who've really taken the mask off.
[2:58:22.000 --> 2:58:24.000]  The lines in the sand for everybody now.
[2:58:24.000 --> 2:58:29.000]  But you'd already chosen to fight the corruption and to stand with God and to stand with the unborn.
[2:58:29.000 --> 2:58:35.000]  So I just want to take time out again to salute the audience, because you are truly activist in the arena.
[2:58:35.000 --> 2:58:39.000]  And without you and your prayers and your word of mouth and your financial support,
[2:58:39.000 --> 2:58:43.000]  this operation that you built, that your operation would not be here.
[2:58:43.000 --> 2:58:48.000]  We've got some giant specials running right now at inforwarsstore.com. A lot of items, 50% off.
[2:58:48.000 --> 2:58:54.000]  Please take advantage of it at inforwarsstore.com to help us fight even harder into the future.
[2:59:18.000 --> 2:59:23.000]  When it comes up, you simply click add to home screen. It will then ask you to name the app.
[2:59:23.000 --> 2:59:31.000]  I suggest band.video. You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[2:59:31.000 --> 2:59:36.000]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app,
[2:59:36.000 --> 2:59:39.000]  and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[2:59:39.000 --> 2:59:43.000]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below.
[2:59:43.000 --> 2:59:49.000]  On your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want, be sure and share band.video.
[3:00:14.000 --> 3:00:17.000]  Alright, let's go right to your phone calls with Mike Adams at naturallose.com.
[3:00:17.000 --> 3:00:19.000]  I'm Alex Jones with band.video.
[3:00:19.000 --> 3:00:24.000]  Let's go ahead and go to Kenny in Florida, then Alex and Paul, and that'll be it for calls.
[3:00:24.000 --> 3:00:28.000]  Kenny in Florida brings up a point. DC is a district. Talk about that.
[3:00:28.000 --> 3:00:34.000]  Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call, and I thank God for you and your great crew every day.
[3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:40.000]  I think that Paul's under different guidelines, and President Trump has the right to do whatever he needs to do
[3:00:40.000 --> 3:00:43.000]  to save what's left of this republic.
[3:00:43.000 --> 3:00:49.000]  Well, and that's really true that he's not offensively saying the Marines are going to go throw somebody out of office.
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:00:52.000]  It's the deep state saying they're going to throw him out of office outside of law.
[3:00:52.000 --> 3:00:56.000]  They've been saying that on TV. He'd be crazy not to activate the Marines.
[3:00:56.000 --> 3:00:58.000]  Exactly. You can't make this stuff up, Alex.
[3:00:58.000 --> 3:01:03.000]  And it's time to grow our lawns and pray and get ready to do whatever we have to do.
[3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:07.000]  Well, Kenny, that's why I'm asking everybody to spread the word more than ever
[3:01:07.000 --> 3:01:12.000]  so that even if we go into a physical conflict, we have affected the battle space to a great extent.
[3:01:12.000 --> 3:01:16.000]  You've been holding for like an hour to make some points. What else do you want to say?
[3:01:16.000 --> 3:01:21.000]  I bought about 50% of everything you sell. I love all your products.
[3:01:21.000 --> 3:01:26.000]  Man, I can't say enough how much we appreciate what you and your crew.
[3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:32.000]  You know, you've spent time away from your families and everything, and my hats off to you guys.
[3:01:32.000 --> 3:01:33.000]  We love you.
[3:01:33.000 --> 3:01:37.000]  Well, my hats off to you, brother. Listen, wild horses can't drag me away.
[3:01:37.000 --> 3:01:41.000]  That's my problem. I work too much, then I become a jerk to the crew, and I apologize to them
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:44.000]  because I get really mad about this. This isn't a game.
[3:01:44.000 --> 3:01:47.000]  That's why people call in and say, oh, you're not for real. You're a fake.
[3:01:47.000 --> 3:01:50.000]  I mean, give me a break, folks. We just brought the war.
[3:01:50.000 --> 3:01:54.000]  The CIA just put out a book, the left CIA, saying we've got to be taken off the air
[3:01:54.000 --> 3:01:57.000]  and that we're kicking their ass. That means you're kicking their ass.
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:01:59.000]  Mike Adams, you want to speak to that?
[3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:03.000]  You know, Saturday or Sunday, you know, sometimes you and I will talk or text.
[3:02:03.000 --> 3:02:08.000]  We're always working. Evenings, holidays, you name it, because this fight never ends
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:11.000]  for freedom and liberty and our republic and protecting our president.
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:17.000]  So we are totally dedicated to this, and I think that's part of the reason why we are still here.
[3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:22.000]  Anyone who tries to take us out, they know we'll have fierce resistance.
[3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:26.000]  Well, my middle daughter, my youngest daughter, went to bed at nine o'clock last night,
[3:02:26.000 --> 3:02:30.000]  and I worked till midnight and I got up at 5 a.m. because they were so sweet and so good.
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:35.000]  I physically had to go research and get ready so I do a better show today, and we did.
[3:02:35.000 --> 3:02:39.000]  I had to just get my mind in the zone because I was mad about yesterday's show.
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:41.000]  It wasn't bad, but I just really had to get them.
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:43.000]  I think we've done really powerful broadcasts today.
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:46.000]  People can see that because I just totally got in the zone.
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:02:50.000]  I dreamed about this for the five hours I was asleep.
[3:02:50.000 --> 3:02:54.000]  Wow. Well, it's your brain organizing the information for the presentation.
[3:02:54.000 --> 3:02:58.000]  Look, your show is fantastic. Your information is light years ahead.
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:03:01.000]  It's not that good a lot of the time. The point is we're fighting hard.
[3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:03.000]  I'm just letting the listeners know we appreciate them, and I appreciate you.
[3:03:03.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  You talk about organizing things we couldn't do without you, Mike.
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:11.000]  Well, you know what? It's a team effort for this nation, and you and I aren't going to be around forever.
[3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:18.000]  But while we're here, while we're on this planet, while we're serving, frankly, the interests of God,
[3:03:18.000 --> 3:03:21.000]  we are just here to help defend life and liberty, and that's it.
[3:03:21.000 --> 3:03:24.000]  And we're going to do it for as long as we can. End of story.
[3:03:24.000 --> 3:03:29.000]  I got to tell you, that's the thing when the listeners think me, it's a privilege to do this.
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:33.000]  It's what we're meant to do, my cells. Everything goes, this is what I'm supposed to do.
[3:03:33.000 --> 3:03:39.000]  The satisfaction of this is, I mean, that's what people think.
[3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:42.000]  Oh, it's hard to fight tyranny. Yeah, they go after you and physically things.
[3:03:42.000 --> 3:03:45.000]  It doesn't matter when the spirits lined up.
[3:03:45.000 --> 3:03:50.000]  Yeah, that's right. I mean, at the end of every day, we can go home knowing in our hearts
[3:03:50.000 --> 3:03:56.000]  and in our minds, even at a spiritual level, that we are fighting the good fight for freedom,
[3:03:56.000 --> 3:04:00.000]  for all human beings, for life, for all human beings, including the unborn.
[3:04:00.000 --> 3:04:04.000]  And that's something that goes with us beyond this lifetime, by the way.
[3:04:04.000 --> 3:04:09.000]  There's a spiritual element to this that, you know, it almost can't even be comprehended on the planet.
[3:04:09.000 --> 3:04:13.000]  Now, I want to be clear. I agree. It's not a goody-two-shoes thing, like, oh, we're goodies.
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:17.000]  We're saving everyone. No, we're humans under attack. We're men. We realize it.
[3:04:17.000 --> 3:04:21.000]  And so we're in the fight. And I'm telling people, man, you're missing out if you aren't fully committed.
[3:04:21.000 --> 3:04:26.000]  You'll be so alive for those of you that serve evil if you just renounce the devil.
[3:04:26.000 --> 3:04:30.000]  Well, and they're literally going to burn in hell. You know, their souls will burn in hell,
[3:04:30.000 --> 3:04:35.000]  and they will suffer a thousand times over for the suffering that they cause on this planet.
[3:04:35.000 --> 3:04:40.000]  Those days are coming for them, and I pity them. I pity them, and I pray for them, too,
[3:04:40.000 --> 3:04:43.000]  because maybe they still have a chance to turn around while they're alive.
[3:04:43.000 --> 3:04:47.000]  Maybe they could do something good for a change, but who knows? We'll have to watch and see.
[3:04:47.000 --> 3:04:50.000]  Amazing. It's true. And what comes around goes around, folks.
[3:04:50.000 --> 3:04:52.000]  You will pay for what you've done in this life of the next.
[3:04:52.000 --> 3:04:54.000]  Thank you, my God. It was naturalnews.com.
[3:04:54.000 --> 3:04:57.000]  A few more calls, and Joe Salete's taking over. He's ready, too.
[3:04:57.000 --> 3:05:02.000]  He's in the dugout. He's coming out like a raging bull. Stay with us.
[3:05:02.000 --> 3:05:09.000]  The globalists and their Democrat minions are on the verge of taking this cold civil war hot.
[3:05:09.000 --> 3:05:15.000]  They have pushed and pushed and pushed and engaged in hoaxes and crimes and censorship
[3:05:15.000 --> 3:05:22.000]  and sabotage of the economy and attacks run by the U.N. on the border that are nothing short of war.
[3:05:22.000 --> 3:05:27.000]  And that's because it is a war by multinational corporations, allies with the Cheycombs and others,
[3:05:27.000 --> 3:05:32.000]  with the Hollywood, America-hating, God-hating filth to try to capture the United States.
[3:05:32.000 --> 3:05:38.000]  This is 21st-century war, and wars need money to be prosecuted.
[3:05:38.000 --> 3:05:42.000]  And we're actually winning the war, but the enemy's throwing their full weight at us right now.
[3:05:42.000 --> 3:05:45.000]  That's why we need financial support. It's a total 360 win.
[3:05:45.000 --> 3:05:48.000]  Double patriot points. 50% on store-wide free shipping.
[3:05:48.000 --> 3:05:52.000]  It's about to end with a running out of a lot of these products at infowarstore.com.
[3:05:52.000 --> 3:05:56.000]  And I need you to get in there, step to the plate, get high-quality products you already need,
[3:05:56.000 --> 3:06:08.000]  and find the information more at infowarstore.com.
[3:06:08.000 --> 3:06:16.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[3:06:16.000 --> 3:06:20.000]  From Kingston, New York, TrendsResearch.com, Gerald Salinde taking over.
[3:06:20.000 --> 3:06:23.000]  In just a few minutes, I promised to get to every caller that got in on the phone lines.
[3:06:23.000 --> 3:06:28.000]  These are like call 25 and 26 we're going to go to, so we're getting that goal to take more calls.
[3:06:28.000 --> 3:06:32.000]  And the listeners are loving it. I'm loving it. All the great points you bring up.
[3:06:32.000 --> 3:06:36.000]  Let's talk to Paul and then Alex, or Alex and then Paul. It's been holding long.
[3:06:36.000 --> 3:06:41.000]  That will be Alex. Alex in the great state of Texas, you're on the air. Welcome.
[3:06:41.000 --> 3:06:45.000]  All righty. I don't think that impeachment is going to work,
[3:06:45.000 --> 3:06:50.000]  but I think they're going to use an economic collapse in a way to remove him.
[3:06:50.000 --> 3:06:56.000]  That's what my worry is. And the criticism I have with Trump has to do with the economy.
[3:06:56.000 --> 3:07:02.000]  Now, candidate Trump was really emphasizing just how inaccurate they measure GDP
[3:07:02.000 --> 3:07:08.000]  and the Federal Reserve and all that. He's kind of gone off track a little bit on that.
[3:07:08.000 --> 3:07:13.000]  You know, you're a million percent right about that, but that's what he had to deal with.
[3:07:13.000 --> 3:07:17.000]  The China and others are in a giant deflation operation.
[3:07:17.000 --> 3:07:22.000]  We're in an economic war, and as soon as Trump got in, they tried to kill the economy further.
[3:07:22.000 --> 3:07:26.000]  So he said, well, Dan, if you do, Dan, if you don't, so we got into an inflation war with them.
[3:07:26.000 --> 3:07:29.000]  That's super bad. But the alternative, he believed, was worse.
[3:07:29.000 --> 3:07:32.000]  If they stalled the economy completely, they would have already removed him.
[3:07:32.000 --> 3:07:34.000]  That they're trying to kill it now to do that.
[3:07:34.000 --> 3:07:38.000]  So Joe Salete is right. Best thing Trump said is we don't need China.
[3:07:38.000 --> 3:07:43.000]  They're using their own people. And it's all on one-sided deal.
[3:07:43.000 --> 3:07:47.000]  But I mean, absolutely. And he's hung a saun's job to dry, and he's done a bunch of other stuff.
[3:07:47.000 --> 3:07:51.000]  The thing is, though, the deep state wants him out because Hillary was 20 times worse.
[3:07:51.000 --> 3:07:56.000]  And so that's why it's so dangerous that they're trying to remove him by force
[3:07:56.000 --> 3:08:01.000]  and talking about doing it on the news to see if they can normalize it. Anything else, Alex?
[3:08:01.000 --> 3:08:07.000]  There was a great South Park episode, so making fun of China, you might want to check that out.
[3:08:07.000 --> 3:08:12.000]  I was told about that last week by Connor in there, and I need to play that out.
[3:08:12.000 --> 3:08:14.000]  Tell me about the episode.
[3:08:14.000 --> 3:08:19.000]  Well, they're just showing how they're buying up everything.
[3:08:19.000 --> 3:08:25.000]  They're using entertainment. We're kind of selling ourselves out. That's where it comes down to.
[3:08:25.000 --> 3:08:30.000]  Boy, I got to tell you, I was the first 18 years ago to say that China was buying up Hollywood
[3:08:30.000 --> 3:08:32.000]  because I was out in Hollywood and learned it from...
[3:08:32.000 --> 3:08:35.000]  Most people meet high-powered producers.
[3:08:35.000 --> 3:08:44.000]  I mean, I'm talking The Lawyer for Steven Spielberg, The Lawyers for people like Mark Berg,
[3:08:44.000 --> 3:08:47.000]  The Lawyers for people... I'm not name-dropping here.
[3:08:47.000 --> 3:08:51.000]  I got out as quick as I could for people like James Cameron.
[3:08:51.000 --> 3:08:56.000]  I mean, I'm talking The Lawyers and others.
[3:08:56.000 --> 3:09:00.000]  And they were just openly talking about the chai comms taking over and buying everything.
[3:09:00.000 --> 3:09:04.000]  So I saw it for myself. God bless you. I appreciate your call.
[3:09:04.000 --> 3:09:06.000]  People sure made jokes about that when I talked about it.
[3:09:06.000 --> 3:09:09.000]  Now, the NBA bows to communist China and says,
[3:09:09.000 --> 3:09:15.000]  We'll fire our manager that said he supports people not being killed by the Chinese military in Hong Kong.
[3:09:15.000 --> 3:09:17.000]  We're sorry. They said too late.
[3:09:17.000 --> 3:09:22.000]  Same group that bought Reddit and banned the Donald said,
[3:09:22.000 --> 3:09:27.000]  Oh, you know, you're not going to get to go into the China now.
[3:09:27.000 --> 3:09:30.000]  Be a tin cent. I mean, it's pathetic.
[3:09:30.000 --> 3:09:35.000]  Big article up on infowars.com. Then they came for Joe Rogan, meant to play it today, didn't have time.
[3:09:35.000 --> 3:09:39.000]  But it's really a good report where I just say, look, Joe, I told you all this.
[3:09:39.000 --> 3:09:43.000]  You could help lead us out of all the censorship, but instead you're going to wait.
[3:09:43.000 --> 3:09:45.000]  They're going to carve you down to nothing before they're done.
[3:09:45.000 --> 3:09:49.000]  That's why I really went after Joe, mainly to get him to try to wake up.
[3:09:49.000 --> 3:09:51.000]  But I didn't want to be fed the bone to get on a show.
[3:09:51.000 --> 3:09:56.000]  I wanted him to understand what was going to happen. He's a smart guy, man.
[3:09:56.000 --> 3:10:00.000]  People go, Oh, Joe Rogan, you know, is he smart? Is he not? No, I know Joe real well.
[3:10:00.000 --> 3:10:04.000]  He knows everything I know and more. He's super smart. He knows all this stuff.
[3:10:04.000 --> 3:10:08.000]  And he thinks he can, you know, walk a tightrope and I'm sorry, you can't do that.
[3:10:08.000 --> 3:10:11.000]  You've got to decide which side you're on, Joe.
[3:10:11.000 --> 3:10:15.000]  One more call than Joe Salim. They've taken over Paul in South Carolina.
[3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:17.000]  You're on the air. Welcome, sir.
[3:10:17.000 --> 3:10:22.000]  Hello. First of all, big fan of your show. Loving every bit of it.
[3:10:22.000 --> 3:10:27.000]  Keep an America grape with your podcast. And I just have a quick question.
[3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:32.000]  So you've been banned by Twitter, YouTube,
[3:10:32.000 --> 3:10:40.000]  and you've been trashed by the mainstream media for saying the truth, which I respect.
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:44.000]  So like, I just got to ask you, like, how do you keep yourself motivated?
[3:10:44.000 --> 3:10:50.000]  And how do you just not give up the way you do, which is admirable about you, by the way?
[3:10:50.000 --> 3:10:53.000]  I wish I could grow up and be just like you.
[3:10:53.000 --> 3:10:56.000]  Well, sir, let me just explain a paradigm shift here.
[3:10:56.000 --> 3:10:59.000]  I am nothing special. I'm just primitive.
[3:10:59.000 --> 3:11:04.000]  But nowadays being domesticated means you're stupid, you're weak, you're passive, you give in,
[3:11:04.000 --> 3:11:08.000]  which we all do to a certain extent. I'm weak and soft compared to my ancestors.
[3:11:08.000 --> 3:11:12.000]  My ancestors didn't have the access to medicine I have or even knowledge itself,
[3:11:12.000 --> 3:11:17.000]  but they had common sense and on average were much tougher and much more rugged
[3:11:17.000 --> 3:11:20.000]  and much more inventive and lived close to the ground.
[3:11:20.000 --> 3:11:25.000]  And so they were street smart. They were smart to the ways of the wild.
[3:11:25.000 --> 3:11:27.000]  They were more rugged.
[3:11:27.000 --> 3:11:32.000]  And so people say, what's it like to be under attack and lied about and demonized?
[3:11:32.000 --> 3:11:36.000]  Well, that's a sign of failure. No, no, that's a sign of success.
[3:11:36.000 --> 3:11:40.000]  If you're a cruise missile coming in to deliver a nuclear weapon over your enemy,
[3:11:40.000 --> 3:11:42.000]  you're going to have radar shooting at you.
[3:11:42.000 --> 3:11:46.000]  You're going to have high-powered Aegis guns trying to shoot you down.
[3:11:46.000 --> 3:11:48.000]  You're going to have countermeasure missiles trying to stop you.
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:51.000]  You get into the target, detonate and vaporize the enemy.
[3:11:51.000 --> 3:11:54.000]  You've been destroyed, but you just won.
[3:11:54.000 --> 3:11:56.000]  Now, I don't want to die on this. I'm not fatalistic.
[3:11:56.000 --> 3:11:58.000]  But if I need to, I'll step up right now.
[3:11:58.000 --> 3:12:03.000]  And so that's what this is all about because I'm not going to sit here and watch a bunch of evil people
[3:12:03.000 --> 3:12:08.000]  that are anti-human take over and destroy our destiny and domesticate us even further on purpose.
[3:12:08.000 --> 3:12:14.000]  I want us to make it to the next level because my very genes, my genetics, my cells cry out for it.
[3:12:14.000 --> 3:12:18.000]  So it's admirable to want to survive.
[3:12:18.000 --> 3:12:20.000]  And to realize I'm trying to change things.
[3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:23.000]  I'm not trying to make friends with the system or get a bigger house or a better car.
[3:12:23.000 --> 3:12:25.000]  If we have freedom, that'll all come with it.
[3:12:25.000 --> 3:12:29.000]  But that's a side issue. I want the spirit of liberty.
[3:12:29.000 --> 3:12:34.000]  I want that true power for my progeny to be able to have a chance to live like they want to
[3:12:34.000 --> 3:12:38.000]  and have their own destiny, not be told who they'll be or what they're going to be.
[3:12:38.000 --> 3:12:41.000]  It's like Joe Salente talks about if he was brought up in Italy today,
[3:12:41.000 --> 3:12:45.000]  he wouldn't be able to be super successful in all these number one New York Times bestselling books
[3:12:45.000 --> 3:12:48.000]  and all the things he's done because he'd be in a caste system.
[3:12:48.000 --> 3:12:52.000]  Same thing with India, but in America he had a chance to be who he was.
[3:12:52.000 --> 3:12:55.000]  Same thing with so many other great Americans.
[3:12:55.000 --> 3:12:57.000]  I don't want to start harping on Italians, but like Frank Sinatra,
[3:12:57.000 --> 3:12:59.000]  think he could be like that in Italy? No, he couldn't be.
[3:12:59.000 --> 3:13:02.000]  You think somebody from Germany or Japan could do that in their country?
[3:13:02.000 --> 3:13:05.000]  No, here they could do it. And we're losing that.
[3:13:05.000 --> 3:13:08.000]  In other countries, it wasn't about merit who was a general.
[3:13:08.000 --> 3:13:12.000]  It wasn't about merit who was the top artist. It was about who your family was.
[3:13:12.000 --> 3:13:16.000]  In America, it was about merit to a great extent. We're losing that.
[3:13:16.000 --> 3:13:19.000]  And so it's an honor to be attacked, to be a sacrificial lamb.
[3:13:19.000 --> 3:13:23.000]  It's an honor to have these enemies lie about me because I believe in you
[3:13:23.000 --> 3:13:26.000]  and I believe we're going to make it through all this and I believe we're going to change things.
[3:13:26.000 --> 3:13:30.000]  But leadership isn't about just how well you speak or whatever.
[3:13:30.000 --> 3:13:35.000]  It's about willing to go under the knife to be attacked, to be shot up,
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:39.000]  to have broken bones, literally and figuratively, to get an idea out there
[3:13:39.000 --> 3:13:42.000]  so that it takes root and then the end flourishes.
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:46.000]  With all great civilization came incredible sacrifice.
[3:13:46.000 --> 3:13:52.000]  And so I spiritually am ready to pay it back for those that brought me where I am,
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:55.000]  for others in the future, because I'm a very selfish person.
[3:13:55.000 --> 3:13:59.000]  And I know I live on through my progeny and through the great dream
[3:13:59.000 --> 3:14:02.000]  and through the great things my children and grandchildren, their children are going to have.
[3:14:02.000 --> 3:14:05.000]  So it's very selfish to stand up against evil in a good way.
[3:14:05.000 --> 3:14:07.000]  People think, oh, it's giving. No.
[3:14:07.000 --> 3:14:11.000]  No, being a slave of the devil system is sick.
[3:14:11.000 --> 3:14:13.000]  It's a joke. I don't want to be a slave.
[3:14:13.000 --> 3:14:15.000]  And so I want to be free.
[3:14:15.000 --> 3:14:20.000]  And that means that it's the exercise of resistance that is the destination.
[3:14:20.000 --> 3:14:24.000]  It is the exercise of standing up and being sovereign and real
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:27.000]  and standing for who you really are and being legitimate
[3:14:27.000 --> 3:14:33.000]  and being original and authentic instead of fake.
[3:14:33.000 --> 3:14:35.000]  I'm not a follower. I'm a leader.
[3:14:35.000 --> 3:14:39.000]  And so this is the journey, the path. My God, I've won the frickin' lottery.
[3:14:39.000 --> 3:14:43.000]  They imprison me if they kill me. I still win because I was real to the end
[3:14:43.000 --> 3:14:48.000]  and I delivered and I changed the world and I measured up to my ancestors already
[3:14:48.000 --> 3:14:50.000]  and I intend to go the whole way.
[3:14:50.000 --> 3:14:51.000]  God bless you. I appreciate your call.
[3:14:51.000 --> 3:14:54.000]  Gerald Salente is about to take over, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:14:57.000]  The only way they're going to make a shut us down is to put a bullet in my head
[3:14:57.000 --> 3:14:59.000]  or if you don't finance us.
[3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:01.000]  And they're already shutting everything down.
[3:15:01.000 --> 3:15:04.000]  So we're going to have a big victory. Believe me, we've already got the jump on them.
[3:15:04.000 --> 3:15:08.000]  We knew it was all coming. And so we're dug in and it's going to be one hell of a fight.
[3:15:08.000 --> 3:15:12.000]  But I got to tell you, just get coffee, get the fish oil, get turmeric,
[3:15:12.000 --> 3:15:15.000]  get all the great water filters, air filters, stuff you already need,
[3:15:15.000 --> 3:15:19.000]  non-GMO heirloom seeds, great films, great books, great t-shirts, great ball caps.
[3:15:19.000 --> 3:15:22.000]  It's all there at infowarstore.com. You get great stuff you need.
[3:15:22.000 --> 3:15:26.000]  You finance us and it totally pisses off the globalists that they're unable to shut us down.
[3:15:26.000 --> 3:15:28.000]  And it's all about an information war.
[3:15:28.000 --> 3:15:30.000]  Will info war save the world? No.
[3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:32.000]  But will you save the world? All of us together? Damn right.
[3:15:32.000 --> 3:15:35.000]  Because rolling over to these people to let them control the future
[3:15:35.000 --> 3:15:38.000]  and dominate our minds and tell us to roll over and die
[3:15:38.000 --> 3:15:41.000]  and that we don't have any effect in the world is a damn lie.
[3:15:41.000 --> 3:15:43.000]  The new Renaissance is almost here.
[3:15:43.000 --> 3:15:46.000]  If we don't launch the new Renaissance, then we're going to have nuclear war and starvation
[3:15:46.000 --> 3:15:48.000]  and kill our damn future.
[3:15:48.000 --> 3:15:50.000]  Why the hell would we do that like a bunch of jerks?
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:52.000]  Look at our ancestors, all the stuff they built.
[3:15:52.000 --> 3:15:54.000]  Look what we built today, a bunch of crap.
[3:15:54.000 --> 3:15:57.000]  We're going to go to the future by going back to the future.
[3:15:57.000 --> 3:15:59.000]  Gerald Salante takes over.
[3:15:59.000 --> 3:16:01.000]  Really appreciate the crew today. So much more.

[3:18:24.000 --> 3:18:29.000]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches,
[3:18:29.000 --> 3:18:31.000]  it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[3:18:31.000 --> 3:18:33.000]  It sells itself.
[3:18:33.000 --> 3:18:41.000]  But normal turmeric only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[3:18:41.000 --> 3:18:43.000]  Originally obviously from India.

[3:20:31.000 --> 3:20:37.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Salente.
[3:20:37.000 --> 3:20:43.000]  Hey, welcome, welcome to the Alex Jones Show. Great to be here.
[3:20:43.000 --> 3:20:49.000]  You know, Alex was saying so much and so little of time as I'm waiting to go on the air.
[3:20:49.000 --> 3:20:57.000]  I can't remember everything, but what he said was very heartwarming to me and very true to my soul.
[3:20:57.000 --> 3:21:03.000]  And when one of the callers asked him, you know, about, you know, what he was doing and great things now, Alex said,
[3:21:03.000 --> 3:21:10.000]  you know, I can't compare to the Ancestors. You know, they really fought, you know, they had street knowledge.
[3:21:10.000 --> 3:21:16.000]  And boy, you know, I'm listening to them and it's just, you know, warming my heart because I feel the same way.
[3:21:16.000 --> 3:21:20.000]  I could hold a candle to my Ancestors.
[3:21:20.000 --> 3:21:27.000]  And, you know, the time when they came to America, by the way, they didn't like Italians when they came to America.
[3:21:27.000 --> 3:21:34.000]  You know, we were discriminated against. These caused guineas and whops.
[3:21:34.000 --> 3:21:39.000]  I'm up here in Kingston. I belong to the Ulster County Italian American Foundation.
[3:21:39.000 --> 3:21:46.000]  Matter of fact, this coming Sunday, we have the Italian Festival, Columbus Day weekend.
[3:21:46.000 --> 3:21:49.000]  No, I'm not allowed to say Columbus Day, huh? Yeah.
[3:21:49.000 --> 3:21:58.000]  Anyway, and they tell the stories that when there's a lot of Italians in Ulster County, we're 90 miles north of New York City.
[3:21:58.000 --> 3:22:05.000]  They used to have brickyards here and they, and stone, you know, used to bring all the stone.
[3:22:05.000 --> 3:22:11.000]  They're building New York City, this whole area. They're bringing stuff down the Hudson River, right on Hudson River.
[3:22:11.000 --> 3:22:19.000]  And so they brought all these masons and all these craftsmen from Italy and they tell the stories into the 40s and 50s.
[3:22:19.000 --> 3:22:26.000]  How Italians couldn't buy a house in the white sections of Kingston.
[3:22:26.000 --> 3:22:32.000]  You know, so what Alex is talking about is, you know, how we lifted ourselves up.
[3:22:32.000 --> 3:22:38.000]  And now you had pride in yourself and elegance and you had standards.
[3:22:38.000 --> 3:22:47.000]  These people fought. As he said, you know, we have it easy now with all the things that are available to us.
[3:22:47.000 --> 3:22:52.000]  So I thank everything that I am to the ancestors, you know.
[3:22:52.000 --> 3:23:02.000]  And, and as he said, you know, I couldn't be me if I was born in Alta Ville Appinoe, Vica Quentin in Italy.
[3:23:02.000 --> 3:23:06.000]  I'm only because me, because I'm monopoly Donald born in the Bronx.
[3:23:06.000 --> 3:23:10.000]  You know, my blood is Italian, but my heart is American.
[3:23:10.000 --> 3:23:15.000]  And I write about that and everything that I've been writing and I've been writing for many years.
[3:23:15.000 --> 3:23:23.000]  I've been reading The Trends Journal, my best selling books, but my favorite is what Zizi Zizi I gave Honey Boy.
[3:23:23.000 --> 3:23:27.000]  And Zizi is the Neapolitan dialect for your auntie.
[3:23:27.000 --> 3:23:31.000]  So Zia means aunt and Zizi was your auntie.
[3:23:31.000 --> 3:23:33.000]  And the name of the book.
[3:23:33.000 --> 3:23:38.000]  What Zizi gave Honey Boy, she used to call me Honey Boy.
[3:23:38.000 --> 3:23:47.000]  It's a huge story about love, wisdom, and the soul of America.
[3:23:47.000 --> 3:23:53.000]  And that's what's lost, the soul of America.
[3:23:53.000 --> 3:23:57.000]  What the ancestors brought to this country.
[3:23:57.000 --> 3:24:01.000]  And I write about how my grandfather, maybe they all rest in peace.
[3:24:01.000 --> 3:24:07.000]  He used to be the first one online to go vote on election day.
[3:24:07.000 --> 3:24:13.000]  He was so proud to be Americans for all this country that gave us.
[3:24:13.000 --> 3:24:19.000]  And he got people complaining about this and that. Hey, who's perfect in their lives?
[3:24:19.000 --> 3:24:26.000]  Yeah, Americans did terrible things to genocide against indigenous people.
[3:24:26.000 --> 3:24:31.000]  And the continuing genocide against us.
[3:24:31.000 --> 3:24:33.000]  Are you worried about climate change?
[3:24:33.000 --> 3:24:36.000]  How about all the poisons?
[3:24:36.000 --> 3:24:41.000]  Are you dumping into our water, into the air and into the food?
[3:24:41.000 --> 3:24:43.000]  You like all those vaccinations?
[3:24:43.000 --> 3:24:45.000]  Oh, I can't say that.
[3:24:45.000 --> 3:24:54.000]  How about all those chemicals injected into our food to the whole system?
[3:24:54.000 --> 3:25:01.000]  How about drinking the rotten water laden with lead and other chemicals?
[3:25:01.000 --> 3:25:04.000]  Yeah, it's a different kind of genocide.
[3:25:04.000 --> 3:25:11.000]  So what Alex says about being proud to be who we are and looking back to the past
[3:25:11.000 --> 3:25:14.000]  and what you can do to achieve and move higher.
[3:25:14.000 --> 3:25:20.000]  If my parents, my mother was a drug addict and I didn't know who my father was,
[3:25:20.000 --> 3:25:22.000]  you think I'd have a shot?
[3:25:22.000 --> 3:25:25.000]  I'm only me because of where I came from.
[3:25:25.000 --> 3:25:27.000]  And that's what I write in this book.
[3:25:27.000 --> 3:25:35.000]  And the soul of America before it's been robbed from us by the multinationals.
[3:25:35.000 --> 3:25:45.000]  When I was a kid, there were fish stores, stationery stores, drug stores, grocery stores,
[3:25:45.000 --> 3:25:58.000]  mom and pop shops, dress shops, men's shops, shoe stores, not anymore.
[3:25:58.000 --> 3:26:01.000]  Give it all to the big guys.
[3:26:01.000 --> 3:26:09.000]  Get rid of those laws that they had in place that made the immigrants here move up to the middle class.
[3:26:09.000 --> 3:26:16.000]  Kill that Roberts and Patman Act is to the Clayton anti-trust act.
[3:26:16.000 --> 3:26:21.000]  Sherman anti-trust act, Glast eagle act, get rid of them all.
[3:26:21.000 --> 3:26:25.000]  Give all the money to the big guys.
[3:26:25.000 --> 3:26:34.000]  Make us all workers on the plantation of slave landia, the multinational plantation.
[3:26:34.000 --> 3:26:36.000]  So that's where we're at.
[3:26:36.000 --> 3:26:38.000]  And that's where we have to move out of.
[3:26:38.000 --> 3:26:45.000]  We have to bring this country back to we the people, not we the corporations.
[3:26:45.000 --> 3:26:49.000]  Hey, the Supreme Court made those corporations, we the people.
[3:26:49.000 --> 3:26:57.000]  Yeah, to the Supreme Court dressed up in their judge drag and telling us what to do.
[3:26:57.000 --> 3:27:05.000]  Ripping up the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, they could care less.
[3:27:05.000 --> 3:27:12.000]  Look at the militarized police system we have, you break the law, they break your chops.
[3:27:12.000 --> 3:27:16.000]  Big cats, how about that Obama, huh?
[3:27:16.000 --> 3:27:25.000]  Nothing more than a pathological liar like most politicians, that's all they are, are pathological liars.
[3:27:25.000 --> 3:27:34.000]  Maybe he was going to do the deal for the dirty dealers and put them in jail, robbing us of all our money, those two big to fails.
[3:27:34.000 --> 3:27:36.000]  Didn't put one in jail.
[3:27:36.000 --> 3:27:40.000]  He brought in Eric Holder, yeah, hold this.
[3:27:40.000 --> 3:27:46.000]  Too big to jail as the attorney general that did nothing.
[3:27:46.000 --> 3:27:55.000]  Except go back to work for the white shoe boy firms over there and Wall Street law firms.
[3:27:55.000 --> 3:28:05.000]  So the only way this country is going to go back to me is to go back to rise is also what Alex said. I forgot so many things that he said.
[3:28:05.000 --> 3:28:08.000]  A renaissance.
[3:28:08.000 --> 3:28:17.000]  Ale Ramona Alantica in the manner of the Romans and the ancients, the Italians said to describe the quality of their work during the renaissance.
[3:28:17.000 --> 3:28:21.000]  They just went through the black plague.
[3:28:21.000 --> 3:28:25.000]  Some 60% of Europe was destroyed.
[3:28:25.000 --> 3:28:34.000]  They realized they had to go back to joy and beauty to rise to a higher level.
[3:28:34.000 --> 3:28:37.000]  And that's what we have to do now.
[3:28:37.000 --> 3:28:48.000]  Renaissance, just like Alex Jones said, and I've been saying, Renaissance 2.0.
[3:28:48.000 --> 3:28:56.000]  We need to go higher and stop letting the low lives drag us lower.
[3:28:56.000 --> 3:29:02.000]  So we're going to be right back and remember by those products from info wars stores.
[3:29:02.000 --> 3:29:07.000]  That's why we're introducing what we know is going to be a massive bestseller, Chillforce.
[3:29:07.000 --> 3:29:10.000]  Now let's look at what's in this powerful formula.
[3:29:10.000 --> 3:29:17.000]  Ashwagandha root extract, an ancient medicinal herb used for over 3,000 years to treat stress and relax the patient.
[3:29:17.000 --> 3:29:21.000]  A special amino acid naturally found in some tea leaves.
[3:29:21.000 --> 3:29:26.000]  The compound has been called the stress killer because of its powerful relaxation benefits.
[3:29:26.000 --> 3:29:32.000]  Gabba, an important neurotransmitter that controls functions of the body and mind, including nervous system relaxation.
[3:29:32.000 --> 3:29:35.000]  Gabba is a choice for many to help reduce anxiety.
[3:29:35.000 --> 3:29:40.000]  Rodeola rosea root extract found in the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.
[3:29:40.000 --> 3:29:48.000]  This root is considered a super adaptogen and is believed to help the body in the fight against emotional, mental and physical stress.
[3:29:48.000 --> 3:30:13.000]  It's time to do what I did and take action with the Chillforce challenge at infowarslive.com.
[3:30:13.000 --> 3:30:18.000]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone.

[3:30:31.000 --> 3:30:33.000]  I suggest band.video.

[3:30:38.000 --> 3:30:46.000]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[3:30:46.000 --> 3:30:51.000]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below.

[3:31:10.000 --> 3:31:15.000]  This is a battle of wills between those that want a free world and those that want tyranny.
[3:31:15.000 --> 3:31:19.000]  Those who've bet against humanity and those who've bet on humanity.
[3:31:19.000 --> 3:31:21.000]  So I'm so thankful to you, the listeners.
[3:31:21.000 --> 3:31:22.000]  You are the salt of the earth.

[3:32:05.000 --> 3:32:07.000]  They think the West is dead.
[3:32:07.000 --> 3:32:11.000]  They think if they censor nationalist and patriots off the internet, you'll just forget about us.
[3:32:11.000 --> 3:32:13.000]  And then they'll be the only information out there.
[3:32:13.000 --> 3:32:15.000]  Well, so far, that's not been working too well for them.
[3:32:15.000 --> 3:32:22.000]  Thanks to you spreading the word steadfastly that the resistance to globalism is alive and well at band.video.

[3:32:58.000 --> 3:33:01.000]  But it's up to you to unleash its full potential.
[3:33:01.000 --> 3:33:11.000]  Thanks for listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:31.000 --> 3:33:43.000]  The only reason the Alex Jones show is here is because not the only reason but to keep it going.
[3:33:43.000 --> 3:33:49.000]  You have to support it. You have to put your money where your heart is and they have great deals going on now.
[3:33:49.000 --> 3:34:01.000]  50 percent off info was life. 50 percent off brain force plus with free shipping and double patriot points. 50 percent off survival shield X to free shipping and double points.

[3:34:21.000 --> 3:34:30.000]  My favorite super male vitality with free shipping and double patriot points.
[3:34:30.000 --> 3:34:33.000]  So the censorship is only going to get worse.
[3:34:33.000 --> 3:34:45.000]  We put one video up a week from my podcasts. The trends in the news. And the last one we put up just up now is called monetary methadone.
[3:34:45.000 --> 3:34:53.000]  And that's the injections at the central banks and junk injecting into the system to keep it going.
[3:34:53.000 --> 3:34:58.000]  So we get a notice from Google. We got that word methadone there.
[3:34:58.000 --> 3:35:07.000]  So this thing got to be checked out. We just can't let you put that there. That's how strict the censorship is.
[3:35:07.000 --> 3:35:12.000]  So do what you can to support info wars.
[3:35:12.000 --> 3:35:25.000]  So as I was saying Alex really nailed it when he talked about the ancestors what they've gone through how hard life used to be and how easy we have it.
[3:35:25.000 --> 3:35:32.000]  He also said we're the ones that can make the difference. There are enough of us that does not take a majority to prevail.
[3:35:32.000 --> 3:35:42.000]  But rather an irate tireless minority keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men and women. Samuel Adams.
[3:35:42.000 --> 3:35:49.000]  So you're in charge. We're putting out the information the facts the data the analysis and the forecasts.
[3:35:49.000 --> 3:35:58.000]  It's up to you to make the change to think for yourself and do what you can. What's going on in Hong Kong. Look how the people are fighting over there.
[3:35:58.000 --> 3:36:04.000]  They know that they don't want to be under the dictatorship of communist rule China.
[3:36:04.000 --> 3:36:13.000]  A little over seven million people two million take to the streets. We're lucky to get a million people out on a pink pussy hat day.
[3:36:13.000 --> 3:36:22.000]  The country of over three hundred and twenty five million people. So this we have to stand up speak out.
[3:36:22.000 --> 3:36:34.000]  I mean who got it in their head that we have to take orders from authorities. What authority. We're a democratic nation.
[3:36:34.000 --> 3:36:42.000]  This is a lot of baloney and they're taking over. And so if we don't fight back we're gone games over fights on.
[3:36:42.000 --> 3:36:50.000]  Moving on to the big issue of course as I see it because it's going to affect the equity markets very deeply.
[3:36:50.000 --> 3:36:59.000]  And the economy and the nation is this BS impeachment process that they're pushing through on the Democratic end.
[3:36:59.000 --> 3:37:12.000]  It's brought to you by the CIA in the deep state. Could you imagine. Could you imagine. That we have the CIA spying on the president in the White House.
[3:37:12.000 --> 3:37:23.000]  I'm not making that up. And of course the headline today from the toilet paper record the New York Times.
[3:37:23.000 --> 3:37:34.000]  Second person blows whistle. On Trump in Ukraine. First hand knowledge could support case for impeachment.
[3:37:34.000 --> 3:37:48.000]  Whistleblower or a blow job. Look at the hypocrisy here. Look how they pumped that up. But hey if Chelsea Manning blows that whistle.
[3:37:48.000 --> 3:38:00.000]  Blow him her into jail. Julian Assange blows that whistle. Put that guy in jail. Keep him locked up.
[3:38:00.000 --> 3:38:12.000]  Ruin his life. Hey how about Snowden huh. Don't blow that whistle about the NSA spying on us.
[3:38:12.000 --> 3:38:20.000]  Watching everything that they do listening to everything that we say. Chelsea Manning yeah.
[3:38:20.000 --> 3:38:36.000]  Oh yeah shows those pictures of those brave guys murdering innocent civilians in Iraq. Put him in jail. Julian Assange for what.
[3:38:36.000 --> 3:38:45.000]  But hey pump those whistleblowers up. They blow good. They're good blow.
[3:38:45.000 --> 3:38:55.000]  Job whistleguides or women. Got to be equal. We don't know.
[3:38:55.000 --> 3:39:04.000]  Look how disgusting this is. And everyone knows I'm not a fan of Trump. I'm not a fan of any of them.
[3:39:04.000 --> 3:39:17.000]  I agree with Trump on the border issues. I agree with him on on tariffs and redoing the whole trade negotiations with communist China.
[3:39:17.000 --> 3:39:27.000]  And NAFTA totally against what he's doing in Venezuela. Totally against his Iranian policy.
[3:39:27.000 --> 3:39:37.000]  And I'm totally against what they're trying to do to get him out of office. This is just Russia gate 2.0.
[3:39:37.000 --> 3:39:43.000]  And we'll call it something else. We'll call it impeachment. What's the big deal here.
[3:39:43.000 --> 3:40:01.000]  Oh I know the big deal. He wanted to find out the dirty deal that Hunter Biden got his boy Biden's boy by getting on the board of directors of barista energy.
[3:40:01.000 --> 3:40:07.000]  The largest energy company in Ukraine.
[3:40:07.000 --> 3:40:13.000]  And of course he wants to do it for presidential purposes as well to win the presidential reality show.
[3:40:13.000 --> 3:40:22.000]  This is not a national crime. A national crime is the dirty slime.
[3:40:22.000 --> 3:40:39.000]  That they should have impeached and should be put in jail. George W. Bush the lying piece of garbage scummy crap of a human being who lied us into the Iraq war.
[3:40:39.000 --> 3:40:48.000]  And a lot of us knew it and a lot of us wrote about it and a lot of us talked about it as it was happening.
[3:40:48.000 --> 3:41:00.000]  He started impeaching the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner Barack Obama a lioness into the Libyan war.
[3:41:00.000 --> 3:41:15.000]  The destruction of Syria. The Afghan troops surge and all of those people that quote I'm really good at killing people with drone strikes.
[3:41:15.000 --> 3:41:34.000]  And look at the people that they have on the mainstream media to support the deep state that's digging it in deep to Trump clapper running.
[3:41:34.000 --> 3:41:48.000]  Yep CNN NBC free press grow up. They got the intelligence agencies right there in front of you intelligence.
[3:41:48.000 --> 3:41:58.000]  What an oxymoron word that is right in front of you telling us what we should believe.
[3:41:58.000 --> 3:42:06.000]  And again that's why you have to support info wars if you want to keep truth alive.
[3:42:06.000 --> 3:42:12.000]  And of course subscribe to our magazine the Trends Journal and by the way you get my book.
[3:42:12.000 --> 3:42:18.000]  I've never written of anything when says he gave Honey Boy when you go to Trends Journal dot com.
[3:42:18.000 --> 3:42:28.000]  What Alex is saying I am one hundred percent behind when it's against the impeachment. This is a disgrace.
[3:42:28.000 --> 3:42:37.000]  The facts are all there. You pick up the toilet paper record. New York Times. No waste of times.
[3:42:37.000 --> 3:42:45.000]  A whole front page with nothing more than stupid excerpts from that telephone conversation that Trump had with the Ukrainian president.
[3:42:45.000 --> 3:42:56.000]  Go inside another full page of nothing but stupid garbage coming from the toilet paper record.
[3:42:56.000 --> 3:43:01.000]  So support info support the truth support the Trends Journal.
[3:43:01.000 --> 3:43:06.000]  My friends I've seen a lot of Donald Trump just like you have.
[3:43:06.000 --> 3:43:13.000]  And my goodness yesterday's press conference when they came in on him with all their garbage the foreign reporters the U.S.
[3:43:13.000 --> 3:43:19.000]  reporters these little political sellouts these whores he just tore them to bits.
[3:43:19.000 --> 3:43:25.000]  And it's one thing to hear it if you're radio listeners powerful but if you see it it's all at band.video.
[3:43:25.000 --> 3:43:31.000]  You've got the full press conference. We've got my boil down of how epic it is. It's all about video.
[3:43:31.000 --> 3:43:36.000]  And I just you've got to share this with people because Trump was hitting on all 45 cylinders.
[3:43:36.000 --> 3:43:39.000]  This was amazing and he turned the nitrous oxide on top of it.
[3:43:39.000 --> 3:43:43.000]  So in full wars America Trump all of us incredible things are happening.
[3:43:43.000 --> 3:43:48.000]  And we're sharing the ideas that are going to defeat the tyrants at band.video.

[3:44:43.000 --> 3:44:46.000]  and then tell others about it so they can get the app.

[3:45:59.000 --> 3:46:03.000]  Infowars tomorrow's news today.
[3:46:03.000 --> 3:46:08.000]  Globalism was doomed to fail if we just exposed it and then resisted it.
[3:46:08.000 --> 3:46:13.000]  Didn't I say a thousand times that there's no way you're going to have an authoritarian corporate
[3:46:13.000 --> 3:46:17.000]  world government above the law that doesn't pay taxes that has diplomatic community
[3:46:17.000 --> 3:46:21.000]  that runs around saying it's communist and socialist power to the people
[3:46:21.000 --> 3:46:24.000]  but then meanwhile is tax exempt again offshore.
[3:46:24.000 --> 3:46:27.000]  Well Trump got that and all these other populists get it.
[3:46:27.000 --> 3:46:30.000]  Why would you throw away wealthy successful countries and cultures
[3:46:30.000 --> 3:46:34.000]  just so you could say the communist Chinese that David Rockefeller put in power
[3:46:34.000 --> 3:46:39.000]  are better than everybody. That is a sick freakish joke.
[3:46:39.000 --> 3:46:43.000]  I will not stand by and watch humanity turn over to these people
[3:46:43.000 --> 3:46:47.000]  and I beg God for the strength and the will to have the discernment
[3:46:47.000 --> 3:46:52.000]  to help be part of their defeat and I've been saying that prayer for 20 plus years
[3:46:52.000 --> 3:46:57.000]  and God is delivering because God is great. Thank God for his son Jesus Christ
[3:46:57.000 --> 3:47:13.000]  and now let's move forward against the NW.
[3:47:28.000 --> 3:47:33.000]  And now your host Gerald Salente.
[3:47:33.000 --> 3:47:38.000]  Hello, hello. Glad you like the show. Hope you like the show.
[3:47:38.000 --> 3:47:43.000]  Anyway, great to be here. And I was mentioning about the impeachment process.
[3:47:43.000 --> 3:47:45.000]  The implications are going to be great.
[3:47:45.000 --> 3:47:51.000]  Go back to when they had the impeachment thing going on with slick Willie Clinton.
[3:47:51.000 --> 3:47:53.000]  You remember that murderer, right?
[3:47:53.000 --> 3:47:58.000]  Oh, you forgot all those 500,000 Iraqi children on the age of five
[3:47:58.000 --> 3:48:03.000]  that were dead because of sanctions on Iraq and Madeline not all that bright
[3:48:03.000 --> 3:48:08.000]  on 60 minutes when she was ambassador to the United Nations of America
[3:48:08.000 --> 3:48:16.000]  asked by Leslie Stahl if the price of those 500,000 Iraqi children
[3:48:16.000 --> 3:48:20.000]  that are dead was worth the sanctions and she said yes it was.
[3:48:20.000 --> 3:48:24.000]  Anyway, when slick Willie was getting impeached,
[3:48:24.000 --> 3:48:28.000]  the equity markets were down some 20%.
[3:48:28.000 --> 3:48:31.000]  That's right, 19 point something.
[3:48:31.000 --> 3:48:36.000]  The markets can't afford to take a hit now because when Clinton was there
[3:48:36.000 --> 3:48:41.000]  we were going through the dot com boom and then markets were flying up.
[3:48:41.000 --> 3:48:45.000]  Now they're being propped up that monetary method.
[3:48:45.000 --> 3:48:50.000]  Keep though, keep some flowing.
[3:48:50.000 --> 3:48:54.000]  So you're seeing a global slowdown happening.
[3:48:54.000 --> 3:49:01.000]  Oh, here's a little headline of just a little bit of interest.
[3:49:01.000 --> 3:49:11.000]  HSBC to axe up to 10,000 jobs.
[3:49:11.000 --> 3:49:17.000]  And when you're looking around the world, let's see.
[3:49:17.000 --> 3:49:24.000]  In August, Deutsche Bank said it would eliminate 18,000 jobs.
[3:49:24.000 --> 3:49:26.000]  One after another.
[3:49:26.000 --> 3:49:30.000]  They're cutting jobs the banksters because they can't make money
[3:49:30.000 --> 3:49:35.000]  with all of this cheap money, low interest rates and there's a global slowdown.
[3:49:35.000 --> 3:49:38.000]  Going back to putting all the pieces together.
[3:49:38.000 --> 3:49:43.000]  The economy cannot afford to take a hit from impeachment.
[3:49:43.000 --> 3:49:48.000]  So when it dries down the market this time is not a lot to prop it up
[3:49:48.000 --> 3:49:51.000]  like back in the Clinton days.
[3:49:51.000 --> 3:49:56.000]  And I also believe that the Democratic National Committee,
[3:49:56.000 --> 3:50:02.000]  which is part of the CIA, considering what they did to Bernie Sanders as well
[3:50:02.000 --> 3:50:05.000]  and how they kept playing the whole Russia Gates story.
[3:50:05.000 --> 3:50:13.000]  And now they're doing this one that they want not only Trump out of there
[3:50:13.000 --> 3:50:16.000]  because Trump's not a member of the club.
[3:50:16.000 --> 3:50:20.000]  He's not one of the white shoe boys as much as he tried to be.
[3:50:20.000 --> 3:50:24.000]  He had to build his own country clubs because the white shoe boys wouldn't let him in.
[3:50:24.000 --> 3:50:29.000]  Didn't go to Harvard, Princeton and Yale. They want him out of there.
[3:50:29.000 --> 3:50:34.000]  And who do they want to buy naked and make it?
[3:50:34.000 --> 3:50:41.000]  How about, how about Elizabeth Warren?
[3:50:41.000 --> 3:50:48.000]  One of the things, one of the things, the thing I do every day is I read tons of information
[3:50:48.000 --> 3:50:57.000]  and I'll just show you outlining salient points of the story.
[3:50:57.000 --> 3:51:00.000]  One after another. Where was that folder here?
[3:51:00.000 --> 3:51:05.000]  Here we go. This is a day's work right here.
[3:51:05.000 --> 3:51:13.000]  All these stories, read an outline, all different information from everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere
[3:51:13.000 --> 3:51:18.000]  in the world that I can go to. The Alexander in a library.
[3:51:18.000 --> 3:51:21.000]  That's the internet today. You get a lot of stuff.
[3:51:21.000 --> 3:51:25.000]  So what you do is you read and then you start seeing the trends happening.
[3:51:25.000 --> 3:51:34.000]  All of a sudden, Warren says donors gave $24.6 million.
[3:51:34.000 --> 3:51:36.000]  This is from one day.
[3:51:36.000 --> 3:51:40.000]  How Warren honed her message.
[3:51:40.000 --> 3:51:42.000]  The business of fearing Elizabeth Warren.
[3:51:42.000 --> 3:51:44.000]  One Warren story after another.
[3:51:44.000 --> 3:51:48.000]  They know that Biden can't win.
[3:51:48.000 --> 3:51:52.000]  It's my belief. They're going to be pushing Warren.
[3:51:52.000 --> 3:51:55.000]  Could Warren pull it off?
[3:51:55.000 --> 3:51:58.000]  She's going to get the woman vote.
[3:51:58.000 --> 3:52:01.000]  A big portion of it. More than Hillary Clinton did.
[3:52:01.000 --> 3:52:05.000]  I think Trump got more women votes than she did.
[3:52:05.000 --> 3:52:09.000]  And she's going to get the millennial and Generation Z vote.
[3:52:09.000 --> 3:52:15.000]  But it's going to be tough for her to win those swing states.
[3:52:15.000 --> 3:52:18.000]  And that's what the election depends on.
[3:52:18.000 --> 3:52:22.000]  It's not popular vote. It's electoral votes.
[3:52:22.000 --> 3:52:25.000]  So Trump may still be able to beat her then.
[3:52:25.000 --> 3:52:30.000]  His talk that Trump might withdraw, might end the presidency.
[3:52:30.000 --> 3:52:34.000]  I don't see it. Not as to who he is.
[3:52:34.000 --> 3:52:39.000]  So just I want to end on that note and also that Bernie Sanders,
[3:52:39.000 --> 3:52:41.000]  he's out of the race.
[3:52:41.000 --> 3:52:44.000]  That heart attack isn't going to help him.
[3:52:44.000 --> 3:52:50.000]  He's 78 years old and there's going to be a negative for him.
[3:52:50.000 --> 3:52:54.000]  So again, staying on the economy, I just read to you,
[3:52:54.000 --> 3:52:57.000]  the big banksters are going down.
[3:52:57.000 --> 3:53:01.000]  You see the money that they're shoving in the QE for.
[3:53:01.000 --> 3:53:05.000]  They're pumping in more money into the banking system
[3:53:05.000 --> 3:53:08.000]  with the repose every day.
[3:53:08.000 --> 3:53:12.000]  They said they were going to stop pumping it in October 10th
[3:53:12.000 --> 3:53:15.000]  to November 4th. They need more cheap money.
[3:53:15.000 --> 3:53:17.000]  They need that monetary method on.
[3:53:17.000 --> 3:53:20.000]  And again, the banksters are getting hurt.
[3:53:20.000 --> 3:53:23.000]  So the economy is going to go down.
[3:53:23.000 --> 3:53:30.000]  Warren is not giving any examples on how to push it back up.
[3:53:30.000 --> 3:53:33.000]  All she's doing is talking about taxing the rich,
[3:53:33.000 --> 3:53:36.000]  which by the way, I'm in favor of as well,
[3:53:36.000 --> 3:53:38.000]  the billionaires could afford to pay more.
[3:53:38.000 --> 3:53:43.000]  And to me, starting at 50 million, they've started increasing the taxes.
[3:53:43.000 --> 3:53:45.000]  That's OK with me.
[3:53:45.000 --> 3:53:47.000]  Give some back to society.
[3:53:47.000 --> 3:53:50.000]  Let's spread it back because the game's been rigged
[3:53:50.000 --> 3:53:52.000]  so the bigs could get more.
[3:53:52.000 --> 3:53:57.000]  So on the economic front, we're heading toward the greatest oppression.
[3:53:57.000 --> 3:54:02.000]  And the system that I teach in trend forecasting is global nomic.
[3:54:02.000 --> 3:54:04.000]  You have to know what's going on in the world,
[3:54:04.000 --> 3:54:07.000]  not only in economics and politics,
[3:54:07.000 --> 3:54:11.000]  but also whether it's the environment, social change,
[3:54:11.000 --> 3:54:15.000]  health, fitness, food, on and on and on.
[3:54:15.000 --> 3:54:18.000]  So I want to just spend these last couple of minutes
[3:54:18.000 --> 3:54:20.000]  talking about what is going on in the world
[3:54:20.000 --> 3:54:23.000]  and how you can see the global depression starting to heat up
[3:54:23.000 --> 3:54:25.000]  and how it's going to get worse
[3:54:25.000 --> 3:54:29.000]  and why you should consider preparing to prosper and prevail later.
[3:54:29.000 --> 3:54:32.000]  And that's what we do at our magazine, The Trends Journal.
[3:54:32.000 --> 3:54:35.000]  So here's just a couple of quick headlines.
[3:54:35.000 --> 3:54:38.000]  Ecuadorian government arrests hundreds
[3:54:38.000 --> 3:54:43.000]  and deploys military action against nationwide strike.
[3:54:43.000 --> 3:54:50.000]  Iran's, that's not one, sweep of mass arrests in Egypt
[3:54:50.000 --> 3:54:54.000]  subdues a protest movement for now.
[3:54:54.000 --> 3:54:59.000]  A rock in flames, Baghdad and lockdown.
[3:54:59.000 --> 3:55:03.000]  Over 100 people have died these protests.
[3:55:03.000 --> 3:55:10.000]  Peru in turmoil after presidential, after president suspended.
[3:55:10.000 --> 3:55:13.000]  One story after another.
[3:55:13.000 --> 3:55:18.000]  The foundation of all of these stories, except the one in Peru,
[3:55:18.000 --> 3:55:20.000]  which they're trying to, well, not really,
[3:55:20.000 --> 3:55:22.000]  because he's trying to break up the corruption
[3:55:22.000 --> 3:55:24.000]  that the government is running,
[3:55:24.000 --> 3:55:27.000]  and this is a new guy from the outside.
[3:55:27.000 --> 3:55:29.000]  It's about the lack of jobs.
[3:55:29.000 --> 3:55:32.000]  It's about the lack of a future.
[3:55:32.000 --> 3:55:35.000]  Take the new job numbers that came out
[3:55:35.000 --> 3:55:37.000]  from the United States last week.
[3:55:37.000 --> 3:55:39.000]  Hey, guess what?
[3:55:39.000 --> 3:55:42.000]  No increase in wages.
[3:55:42.000 --> 3:55:45.000]  Nope, no more for the top.
[3:55:45.000 --> 3:55:48.000]  Populism, social unrest.
[3:55:48.000 --> 3:55:51.000]  It's going on globally.
[3:55:51.000 --> 3:55:55.000]  When people lose everything and have nothing left to lose,
[3:55:55.000 --> 3:55:59.000]  they lose it, and they're losing it around the globe.
[3:55:59.000 --> 3:56:03.000]  When this greatest depression hits, it's going to be much, much worse.
[3:56:03.000 --> 3:56:10.000]  Back then in 1930s, 2 billion cats and kittens on the planet.
[3:56:10.000 --> 3:56:17.000]  Now, we've added 5.5 billion more people since then.
[3:56:17.000 --> 3:56:21.000]  You think you've got a refugee and migrant crisis now?
[3:56:21.000 --> 3:56:24.000]  I'm showing you what's going on over the world from South Africa.
[3:56:24.000 --> 3:56:27.000]  You name it, South America.
[3:56:27.000 --> 3:56:29.000]  They're going to be flooding out of the Middle East,
[3:56:29.000 --> 3:56:32.000]  out of these war zones, out of everywhere
[3:56:32.000 --> 3:56:36.000]  to find safety, to get away from poverty,
[3:56:36.000 --> 3:56:41.000]  to escape criminality and corruption.
[3:56:41.000 --> 3:56:45.000]  It's going to be one mad global madhouse
[3:56:45.000 --> 3:56:48.000]  as the greatest depression hits.
[3:56:48.000 --> 3:56:53.000]  So what we're suggesting is that you prepare, prevail, and prosper now
[3:56:53.000 --> 3:56:56.000]  because this thing is going to come down hard
[3:56:56.000 --> 3:57:02.000]  and the impeachment process is only going to speed it up and make it worse.
[3:57:02.000 --> 3:57:06.000]  If nothing really happens to any great extent right now,
[3:57:06.000 --> 3:57:11.000]  my forecast is the great recession won't hit the United States.
[3:57:11.000 --> 3:57:17.000]  The Great Depression, excuse me, won't hit the United States until 2011.
[3:57:17.000 --> 3:57:23.000]  But thanks to the demo craps and the repulsive kins,
[3:57:23.000 --> 3:57:29.000]  it may hit sooner because if they don't stop this madness,
[3:57:29.000 --> 3:57:31.000]  it's going to get worse.
[3:57:31.000 --> 3:57:35.000]  And another important trend, do not spend your time,
[3:57:35.000 --> 3:57:39.000]  a lot of it wasted on this impeachment stuff.
[3:57:39.000 --> 3:57:42.000]  Learn about the current events forming future trends
[3:57:42.000 --> 3:57:45.000]  and you can learn about them by subscribing to The Trends Journal
[3:57:45.000 --> 3:57:47.000]  and remember, support info wars.
[3:57:47.000 --> 3:57:53.000]  Keep the truth alive. See you next time.
