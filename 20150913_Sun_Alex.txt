[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on the Sunday, September 13, 2015.
[00:25.000 --> 00:27.000]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[00:27.000 --> 00:32.000]  Alex Jones is going to be joining us in the next segment with a breakdown of today's news
[00:32.000 --> 00:34.000]  and there is a lot of it.
[00:34.000 --> 00:37.000]  We've got an article here from, that's just from the Drudge Report.
[00:37.000 --> 00:38.000]  Give them a hat tip.
[00:38.000 --> 00:44.000]  The New York Times talking about Justice Breyer, one of the Supreme Court justices who is promoting a new book.
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.000]  He's going to be on the Colbert late show tomorrow night on CBS,
[00:48.000 --> 00:52.000]  the new show that Stephen Colbert has taken over from David Letterman.
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.000]  He's going to be pushing that book, talking about that book. Listen to the title of the book,
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.000]  The Court and the World, American Law and the New Global Realities.
[01:02.000 --> 01:07.000]  Because, you know, we have to not be so concerned about things that are in America like the Constitution.
[01:07.000 --> 01:12.000]  We really need to make our decisions based on what the rest of the world is doing.
[01:12.000 --> 01:17.000]  That's essentially the thrust of his book and as the New York Times points out in their article,
[01:17.000 --> 01:23.000]  he is someone who more than anyone else has voted with the majority this last year.
[01:23.000 --> 01:30.000]  So at 77, Justice Breyer really is the mainstream of thought in the Supreme Court.
[01:30.000 --> 01:34.000]  And what we're seeing, regardless of what you think about these different issues,
[01:34.000 --> 01:41.000]  what we're seeing over and over again, is a court that of course legislates unashamedly, legislates from the bench.
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.000]  They don't really care what the laws are, they don't care what the Constitution is,
[01:44.000 --> 01:51.000]  they don't see Congress see their job as interpreting the Constitution or the laws that Congress passes in light of the Constitution.
[01:51.000 --> 01:57.000]  No, they're there to reflect what they consider to be the wishes of the people.
[01:57.000 --> 02:00.000]  That's what we saw with the Supreme Court's decisions on marriage.
[02:00.000 --> 02:03.000]  It really wasn't a constitutional determination.
[02:03.000 --> 02:11.000]  They were basically, they threw in some issues out of, they threw in the amendment about some of the amendments
[02:11.000 --> 02:16.000]  after the Civil War that were set up to establish equal protection for slaves,
[02:16.000 --> 02:22.000]  establish the legal rights of former slaves who were now free to give them voting rights and other rights.
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.000]  They threw some of that stuff in that clearly was not what it was talking about.
[02:25.000 --> 02:30.000]  Look, if you want to talk about Supreme Court decisions, just look at the abortion decision
[02:30.000 --> 02:36.000]  where they said that the right to kill your child is a decision of privacy.
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  Clearly, they're cherry picking and playing with the definitions of privacy.
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.000]  They could care less about your privacy when it comes to dragnet surveillance.
[02:43.000 --> 02:49.000]  They could care less about your privacy at the airport when the government sticks their hands on you and makes demands of you.
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.000]  They don't care one fig about your privacy.
[02:53.000 --> 02:58.000]  This is simply the straws that they use to reflect their personal agenda.
[02:58.000 --> 03:02.000]  And now they're saying that they're doing things that reflect what America wants.
[03:02.000 --> 03:09.000]  But now we're moving to the position where they're unashamedly talking about reflecting global values.
[03:09.000 --> 03:16.000]  And he even references how much of a crisis is created when some Supreme Court justices
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  referred to foreign law as a basis for the decision in the past.
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.000]  They even brought up calls for impeachment, as it should.
[03:24.000 --> 03:30.000]  They took an oath to the Constitution, not to the French law, not to British law, not to German law,
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.000]  not to any other law, not to the UN's regulations.
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  They took an oath to the Constitution.
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.000]  But of course, we've been seeing this going on for a very long time.
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.000]  What is different about all this is what we continue to see.
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.000]  The mask is coming off.
[03:44.000 --> 03:47.000]  They've tried to pretend that they're operating under the rules that we've had.
[03:47.000 --> 03:50.000]  They try to pretend that they are operating under the Constitution,
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  which gives them their legitimate authority.
[03:52.000 --> 03:55.000]  If they had legitimate authority, they would be operating under it.
[03:55.000 --> 04:00.000]  When they get out from underneath the Constitution, they delegitimize their authority.
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.000]  But now they're doing it openly, just as we saw the mask come off with the NSA.
[04:05.000 --> 04:12.000]  There was an amazing article from James Clapper saying that the US intelligence community is kind of like Spider-Man.
[04:12.000 --> 04:16.000]  He says Spider-Man is known for his precognitive spidey senses.
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  Well, many of our customers expect us to be clairvoyant when it comes to things.
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.000]  Interesting that James Clapper would talk about being clairvoyant.
[04:24.000 --> 04:33.000]  We talk about precognition because James Clapper has been from the very beginning intimately tied into geospatial intelligence.
[04:33.000 --> 04:38.000]  It looks at your activity that tries to map you out in the human domain analytics.
[04:38.000 --> 04:44.000]  Now, the analogy to Spider-Man is with great power comes great responsibility.
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.000]  And if you throw away the Constitution, you've thrown away your responsibility as well as your authority.
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.000]  Stay with us. Alex Jones is going to break down the news when we come back.
[04:52.000 --> 05:04.000]  We'll be right back after this break.
[05:22.000 --> 05:27.000]  Call toll free 888-253-3139.
[05:52.000 --> 05:58.000]  That's infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[06:22.000 --> 06:26.000]  Thousands flock to anti-migrant demonstrations in Eastern Europe.
[06:26.000 --> 06:30.000]  Top feminist says put all men in concentration camps.
[06:30.000 --> 06:34.000]  She writes for the Guardian. She's not joking. She says she's not joking.
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.000]  And end heterosexuality. That's been the plan the whole time.
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.000]  Psychopaths are running the world. Former U.S. Marine blows the whistle.
[06:41.000 --> 06:44.000]  On Syrian false flag exposes real agenda.
[06:44.000 --> 06:48.000]  GOP defund Planned Parenthood even if it didn't break the law.
[06:48.000 --> 06:51.000]  Well, it did break the law and we shouldn't be funding it.
[06:51.000 --> 06:56.000]  Continuing private property expropriated by German state for refugees.
[06:56.000 --> 06:59.000]  That's just some of the headlines up on infowars.com.
[06:59.000 --> 07:01.000]  We're breaking down today.
[07:01.000 --> 07:04.000]  But first off, let's look at the quote migrant crisis.
[07:04.000 --> 07:09.000]  Because within that you have a prism through which you can see all the spectrums of lies.
[07:09.000 --> 07:12.000]  The entire cacophony of fraud.
[07:12.000 --> 07:15.000]  First off, they're not migrants.
[07:15.000 --> 07:21.000]  A migrant would be, say, Bedouin in Saudi Arabia who by law are allowed as desert people
[07:21.000 --> 07:26.000]  to just basically cross highways wherever they want, block traffic, do whatever they want.
[07:26.000 --> 07:30.000]  It's kind of like farmers are allowed to drive 10 miles an hour down the side of the road with their tractor.
[07:30.000 --> 07:34.000]  Because it's part of the culture. It's part of commerce.
[07:34.000 --> 07:36.000]  It's part of what was before.
[07:36.000 --> 07:41.000]  It's like Native Americans are allowed on their ancestral lands to basically do their own rituals
[07:41.000 --> 07:46.000]  and to engage in some of those ancient migrations.
[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  That is what a migrant is.
[07:48.000 --> 07:56.000]  People out of North Africa, the Middle East, Asia, you name it, coming in on boats, coming in on planes,
[07:56.000 --> 08:03.000]  driving in, walking in, carjacking, truckjacking, and then coming in by the hundreds of thousands per month per country
[08:03.000 --> 08:08.000]  and just demanding everything free is not a migrant.
[08:08.000 --> 08:13.000]  See if I show up at your house and knock on the door and say,
[08:13.000 --> 08:18.000]  hi, I'm a migrant and I'd like you to have me move into your bedroom as they're doing in Sweden,
[08:18.000 --> 08:20.000]  telling them how's the illegals.
[08:20.000 --> 08:23.000]  I would be an invader and you'd laugh at me and say, get off my front porch.
[08:23.000 --> 08:27.000]  But see if you're brought in by the government and put on welfare, given driver's license, voting cards,
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  you're now a protected group.
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  And it's wrong. I can't go to Saudi Arabia.
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  I can't go to Syria.
[08:34.000 --> 08:36.000]  I can't go to Libya and get stuff for free.
[08:36.000 --> 08:39.000]  I can't have a baby for free. It's a fraud.
[08:39.000 --> 08:45.000]  And this is a political, admitted, clowered, piven plan to collapse the West and it's working quite nicely.
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000]  Okay?
[08:47.000 --> 08:48.000]  It's crazy.
[08:48.000 --> 08:55.000]  And then in Germany and in Hungary and in Romania and in France and in other countries,
[08:55.000 --> 09:02.000]  in England, in the UK, they're banning, quote, anti-migrant demonstrations.
[09:02.000 --> 09:07.000]  And if you pull even recent immigrants that came legally, they don't want this either.
[09:07.000 --> 09:11.000]  They're not crazy. They're running from the destabilization of the Middle East.
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  And a lot of people argue, well, the West destabilized you with all these wars, so we deserve it.
[09:15.000 --> 09:20.000]  I was against this. You were against this. Most of those wars were unpopular.
[09:20.000 --> 09:25.000]  NATO and others launched this attack on Syria and these aren't even the Syrians we attacked that are coming in.
[09:25.000 --> 09:29.000]  These are the Wahhabist on record that are coming in.
[09:29.000 --> 09:34.000]  They're very people who've been involved in the takeover. Now they can't get the central government of Damascus.
[09:34.000 --> 09:38.000]  They can't get the last third of the country that has the biggest population, so they're out there with nothing.
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.000]  So they are refugees from their attempt to take over.
[09:41.000 --> 09:47.000]  They launched an evil revolution with Saudi Arabian forces and Qatari forces and others with the West backing them.
[09:47.000 --> 09:51.000]  This has all been declassified. Defense Intelligence Head, the general, went public.
[09:51.000 --> 09:57.000]  Deputy Head of the CIA went public this week. Everything we told you years ago now, I'll admit it, because we have the sources.
[09:57.000 --> 10:03.000]  And so that failed, so they won't try to go back into Iraq. They're getting kicked out of there, so they're coming here.
[10:03.000 --> 10:09.000]  Which, again, is the class of civilizations. They stabilize the Middle East, put their forces in, and then just have them go around raising havoc,
[10:09.000 --> 10:12.000]  and then call them angel cakes when they come here.
[10:12.000 --> 10:21.000]  Just like four years ago with the attempted overthrow of Egypt, they took out our old ally, put in the Wahhabist, again, the Muslim Brotherhood.
[10:21.000 --> 10:26.000]  They went around enslaving, blowing up churches, murdering people in mass, killing tens of thousands.
[10:26.000 --> 10:34.000]  I remember watching Anderson Cooper of the Central Intelligence Agency say their freedom fighters, this is wonderful news, what's happening in Cairo.
[10:34.000 --> 10:41.000]  You all saw that. So they've done this, problem-reaction solution, now they're flooding the West.
[10:41.000 --> 10:53.000]  Now we're going to get into some other stories here in a moment, but it all ties together to the very same central system of ending the fact that human families and communities are self-sufficient.
[10:53.000 --> 10:58.000]  That's why the family has to be destroyed. That's why foreigners have to be brought in to destabilize things.
[10:58.000 --> 11:04.000]  That's why free speech, criticizing globalism, has to be banned by authoritarian EU.
[11:04.000 --> 11:11.000]  That's why demonstrations in England against radical Islamic groups calling for murder and bombing are banned and people are arrested,
[11:11.000 --> 11:15.000]  because they cannot allow people to ever stand up.
[11:15.000 --> 11:22.000]  The greatest crime in the UK is defending yourself when someone's trying to rape your wife in your own home, or stabbing somebody who's robbing you in your own home.
[11:22.000 --> 11:29.000]  You're thrown in prison, the criminals are turned loose. If a criminal falls through your skylight, you get sued, you lose your home.
[11:29.000 --> 11:35.000]  That's real cases, because they've got to be worshiped. They're allied with the state. They're part of the destabilization.
[11:35.000 --> 11:39.000]  They're part of making things so bad, you just give up.
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.000]  So that's why it's important to have your own garden. That's why it's important to have your own friends and neighbors.
[11:43.000 --> 11:54.000]  That's why it's important to have your own cook stove and not let them ban basic agrarian activities and wood stoves that's happening from Australia to the United States to Germany.
[11:54.000 --> 12:06.000]  It's a system, again, of serfdom, of feudalism with a high-tech upgrade. That's what's happening in 2015. It's called Agenda 21. It's a worldwide treaty.
[12:06.000 --> 12:15.000]  Now, before I get back into this, I wanted to tell you why I'm not doing the show today. This happens to me every three, four years.
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.000]  I'm a big swimmer, a big open water swimmer. I'm not like Olympic or anything, but I can swim three, four, five miles easily.
[12:20.000 --> 12:26.000]  And I like to swim in creeks. I like to swim in rivers. There's been a lot of rain lately in Central Texas.
[12:26.000 --> 12:36.000]  I came out here on Labor Day last weekend to visit some friends. I was jumping off their two-and-a-half, almost three-story dock into the water.
[12:36.000 --> 12:48.000]  At a bunch of water, I didn't think, shot up my nose. And I thought, oh my gosh, last time that happened, I got real sick and it got into my lymph nodes and my whole face like a chipmunk swole up.
[12:48.000 --> 12:56.000]  You can probably see it's swollen, the lymph nodes, you name it. I almost didn't do the show Friday. These were so swollen.
[12:56.000 --> 13:04.000]  I began taking colloidal silver a couple days ago, and it's really helped. The last few times I had this happen.
[13:04.000 --> 13:11.000]  It happens again every two, three years. They would say, oh, it's bacterial. I'll go to the doctor. They'll give me antibiotics. It wouldn't go away for a week.
[13:11.000 --> 13:19.000]  Whether it's the colloidal silver or not, this time it's gone down 30%, 40% in the last couple days, a lot quicker than the last time with antibiotics.
[13:19.000 --> 13:28.000]  And so I am taking, this is a plug at the same time, but it's a true story. I actually didn't have enough of this at home, and I went back into the office today.
[13:28.000 --> 13:34.000]  And then I called Buckley and I said, let's shoot a video about this because here I am getting colloidal silver because I've already used up the bottles I had at home.
[13:34.000 --> 13:41.000]  And I don't tell you to do this. This is what I personally do when I'm getting rid of something. It's great topically as well. It's classic antibiotic.
[13:41.000 --> 13:50.000]  But consult your physician. This is just my personal opinion and view. When I have an infection, I drink a bottle over three, four days.
[13:50.000 --> 13:56.000]  And I told the story. Well, Buckley's shooting the video. He remembers it. I hate to bring it up. He'll probably tear up.
[13:56.000 --> 14:05.000]  And it was a year and a half ago that my uncle died of a respiratory illness. I got it while I was there. My dad got it. It was sick for two months.
[14:05.000 --> 14:10.000]  And I don't know why I didn't think colloidal silver. I was going to get antibiotics. Two different rounds didn't work.
[14:10.000 --> 14:16.000]  I drank two bottles over a week, so did my dad, and we got better. And I mean, this was the worst infection of my life.
[14:16.000 --> 14:21.000]  And I just want to thank God that I got healed and thank God we have natural things like a silver bullet.
[14:21.000 --> 14:27.000]  And I'm not saying it's the ultimate silver bullet, but it's the closest thing in my life I found to a silver bullet.
[14:27.000 --> 14:33.000]  We're going to go to break here. I'm going to have David take us out. And when we come back, I've got a little bit more other stories I want to cover.
[14:33.000 --> 14:43.000]  And then we will throw things to David so that he can continue with the broadcast, take your calls, have some guests on, and more on this Sunday worldwide broadcast.
[14:43.000 --> 14:49.000]  But that's why I'm not here today. And it's important to rest when you have something like this. I may not be in tomorrow, but David will do a great job.
[14:49.000 --> 14:58.000]  But I'll also tape some reports. I feel okay, but these bacterial infections are not something to mess around with.
[14:58.000 --> 15:04.000]  Thank God it's not an amoeba. You know, like Travis, people die almost every year with these amoebas when it gets above 90 degrees in the water.
[15:04.000 --> 15:12.000]  It's cooled off now, so it's safer. Almost every year somebody dies. And I just think they're migrants. I mean, they're not invading bacteria.
[15:12.000 --> 15:18.000]  I mean, I have smaller ones, which is what I have right now. So I have smaller amoebas that are in me, but not the big ones that eat the brain.
[15:18.000 --> 15:26.000]  You know, the sinus, that's how these got into the smaller bacteria. And I just, they're not, they're not invaders. They're migrants.
[15:26.000 --> 15:36.000]  They're here loving me. They deserve to come in. They deserve to do this. And if they kill me, you know, so what? I mean, they deserve a home as well.
[15:36.000 --> 15:42.000]  So I salute the amoebas. Sorry, sorry, sorry guys. I'm not going to do too well.
[15:42.000 --> 15:53.000]  I'll be clear. A amoeba is a giant single cell bacteria, the biggest. I have little bitty bacteria. I don't have amoebas, but the point is, is that it's the same deal.
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  And so these are migrants right now that have my head swole up with white blood cells fighting them.
[15:57.000 --> 16:06.000]  It's now more clear than ever. The globalists have launched a planetary destabilization plan. Here at the Info Wars operation, we hope and pray that this is not the case.
[16:06.000 --> 16:10.000]  But the signs of things deteriorating around the world are unmistakable.
[16:10.000 --> 16:17.000]  For many years, I've been working with my patriots supply, and we have now developed a private label called Info Wars Select.
[16:17.000 --> 16:22.000]  Look, it's important to have firearms and water filtration during a collapse, but you've also got to have food.
[16:22.000 --> 16:30.000]  Info Wars Select is a wide variety of their highest quality packages at the lowest price they have ever offered before.
[16:30.000 --> 16:32.000]  It's an introductory offer for only two weeks.
[16:32.000 --> 16:43.000]  Visit infowarselect.com or infowarsstore.com and find out why these meals are the highest quality, longest lasting, easiest to transport food solutions you're going to find anywhere.

[20:23.000 --> 20:27.000]  In defense of human liberty Alex Jones.
[20:32.000 --> 20:37.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on the Sunday September 13th 2015.
[20:37.000 --> 20:40.000]  I had to think Friday was September 11th the days of 13th.
[20:40.000 --> 20:42.000]  We've got a lot of news coming up in this broadcast.
[20:42.000 --> 20:49.000]  We've got a Supreme Court Justice who's now pushing a book that says we should take a global view of law.
[20:49.000 --> 20:52.000]  I know they haven't had the Constitution in mind for a long time.
[20:52.000 --> 20:56.000]  And now they're openly talking about how we need to take a globalist view of this.
[20:56.000 --> 21:01.000]  We've got Lindsey Graham saying the conditions are ripe for another 9-11.
[21:01.000 --> 21:02.000]  There you go.
[21:02.000 --> 21:05.000]  You know that story has been around so long that it has gotten ripe.
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.000]  And it stinks to the high heavens.
[21:07.000 --> 21:09.000]  Anybody that's taking a look at the facts of it.
[21:09.000 --> 21:10.000]  But it may not.
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  It's not always going to come around in the same way.
[21:13.000 --> 21:18.000]  What may happen this time may be the release of a Department of Defense bio weapon.
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.000]  We've had some very, very troubling news that's come out yet again.
[21:22.000 --> 21:31.000]  There's every couple of months we find out about a massive loss of control with weaponized viruses and diseases.
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  And yet again this is happening.
[21:33.000 --> 21:36.000]  We see this happening over and over and over again.
[21:36.000 --> 21:37.000]  Another expose.
[21:37.000 --> 21:47.000]  We've got a report on it on infowars.com as well as a report from USA Today because there's a reporter there that's been very good at following these kind of releases.
[21:47.000 --> 21:49.000]  They bring in the deadliest bacteria.
[21:49.000 --> 21:52.000]  This time it's the black plague and other pathogens.
[21:52.000 --> 21:53.000]  They weaponize them.
[21:53.000 --> 21:54.000]  They call them select agents.
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.000]  This is militarized folks.
[21:56.000 --> 22:00.000]  This is what the Department of Defense is doing along with the CDC.
[22:00.000 --> 22:06.000]  They militarize these deadly pathogens that are not native to our area and they weaponize them.
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  They call it gain of function.
[22:08.000 --> 22:14.000]  That's Pentagon speak for making them more deadly and more easily transmitted.
[22:14.000 --> 22:19.000]  We should be very concerned because they're also extremely lax in the way that they handle this.
[22:19.000 --> 22:28.000]  They're constantly getting out of their biosafety labs, even shipping them in standard federal express shipping containers,
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  which is what we're seeing happening yet again.
[22:30.000 --> 22:33.000]  So maybe that's the way the next 9-11 is going to come.
[22:33.000 --> 22:37.000]  And of course we could always conveniently blame it on the terrorists.
[22:37.000 --> 22:43.000]  Whether it is an accident or whether it is deliberate, they will use it that way folks.
[22:43.000 --> 22:51.000]  And of course we've got Donald Trump joining forces with Senator Sessions against the TPP perhaps.
[22:51.000 --> 22:53.000]  That would be a very welcome thing.
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.000]  I don't agree with the rationale that Donald Trump has put out.
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.000]  Maybe he's doing that to walk a political line.
[22:58.000 --> 23:02.000]  But if he opposes it, I will take it anyway it goes.
[23:02.000 --> 23:03.000]  So we're going to talk about that.
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  I find that to be a very hopeful sign.
[23:05.000 --> 23:11.000]  And of course, John Boehner, one of the people who supported fast track for Obama trade.
[23:11.000 --> 23:14.000]  He supported Obamacare in reality.
[23:14.000 --> 23:15.000]  Why wouldn't he support Obamacare?
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  And in fact, he did.
[23:17.000 --> 23:25.000]  And we now have some congressmen like Justin Amash who are talking about why they should oppose the Iran agreement.
[23:25.000 --> 23:30.000]  Because he says this is a treaty and it needs the votes of the people.
[23:30.000 --> 23:31.000]  We have a constitution.
[23:31.000 --> 23:32.000]  Remember who we started?
[23:32.000 --> 23:37.000]  The Supreme Court Justice, Justice Breyer says that we need to take a global dispute.
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  The constitution doesn't matter to any of these people anymore.
[23:39.000 --> 23:45.000]  That's why they can do something like the transatlantic or trans-Pacific partnerships,
[23:45.000 --> 23:49.000]  which are really treaties, and say we don't need to go through the constitutional process to do it.
[23:49.000 --> 23:53.000]  Well, they're not going through the constitutional process with this agreement with Iran.
[23:53.000 --> 23:56.000]  And whether you're for the agreement or against the agreement,
[23:56.000 --> 24:00.000]  you should understand that we don't want to be ruled by dictators.
[24:00.000 --> 24:03.000]  And that's precisely what they're saying with the trans-Pacific partnership.
[24:03.000 --> 24:10.000]  Many of the people who oppose it say, look, like Donald Trump, he says, I don't necessarily oppose a trade agreement like this,
[24:10.000 --> 24:12.000]  but I don't want Obama negotiating it.
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.000]  Well, everybody can say that.
[24:14.000 --> 24:20.000]  We don't want to have a nation that is ruled by the dictates of one individual.
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  That's called a dictatorship.
[24:22.000 --> 24:26.000]  We have this in every area of our government now.
[24:26.000 --> 24:35.000]  Remember, when we're talking about the rules that the NSA broke when they did dragnet surveillance,
[24:35.000 --> 24:41.000]  we had the generals Hayden saying, well, I didn't need section 215.
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  I had a direct order from the president.
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.000]  I had a direct order from the president.
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  That trumped everything.
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  We know what that kind of government is called.
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  It's called a dictatorship.
[24:51.000 --> 24:58.000]  We have a dictatorship when it comes to national security, of course, because everything has to lay down for national security.
[24:58.000 --> 24:59.000]  That trumps everything.
[24:59.000 --> 25:02.000]  We could care less about individual liberty anymore.
[25:02.000 --> 25:09.000]  I mean, this has gotten to be an Orwellian world that we live in where safety equals war,
[25:09.000 --> 25:13.000]  just like Orwell's peace sequel, war equals peace, that type of thing.
[25:13.000 --> 25:14.000]  That's what they're selling us.
[25:14.000 --> 25:19.000]  You can never be safe people if you give up your freedom.
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  You're then a slave, a prisoner.
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  Prisoners and slaves are not safe.
[25:23.000 --> 25:24.000]  You're never safe.
[25:24.000 --> 25:30.000]  The only way that you can ever hope to achieve safety is if you put liberty first.
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.000]  You cannot trade away your liberty for security or for safety.
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  But we see that coming at us over and over again.
[25:36.000 --> 25:46.000]  And I want to go back to what Alex Jones was talking about in the last segment when he was talking about the massive influx that is happening throughout Europe.
[25:46.000 --> 25:49.000]  Whereas we may soon be calling it Arabia.
[25:49.000 --> 25:52.000]  That was Mark Stein's term for it.
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  And I think it's clearly going to fit.
[25:54.000 --> 26:00.000]  He was talking about a demographic change in the sense that Europeans were not reproducing anymore.
[26:00.000 --> 26:07.000]  You take a country like Italy where they used to have the highest number of children per family, well over five.
[26:07.000 --> 26:12.000]  And now it's well under two, which means that they are cutting their population almost down to one,
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.000]  which means that their population gets cut in half every generation.
[26:16.000 --> 26:23.000]  So if you have any immigration from Muslims who do have a high number of children in their family,
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  then they're going to very quickly take over the demographics.
[26:25.000 --> 26:28.000]  But now it has accelerated quite a bit.
[26:28.000 --> 26:29.000]  So let's talk about that.
[26:29.000 --> 26:34.000]  Before we do, I want to let you know that this hour of the Alex Jones show is brought to you by Brainforce.
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.000]  We've just got a new shipment of Brainforce in from our manufacturer.
[26:37.000 --> 26:44.000]  You can find that at InfowarsLife.com, both listeners and the Infowar crew can't stop talking about what Brainforce does for them.
[26:44.000 --> 26:45.000]  I take it regularly.
[26:45.000 --> 26:48.000]  I've noticed a real difference with me when I take it.
[26:48.000 --> 26:51.000]  And so it's something that I do all the time, take it regularly.
[26:51.000 --> 26:55.000]  Unlike some energy drinks and supplements, things like just taking caffeine,
[26:55.000 --> 27:02.000]  Brainforce uses natural brain activation ingredients like Urbimate Extract and Alpha GPC.
[27:02.000 --> 27:10.000]  Brainforce and InfowarsLife.com already has hundreds of five-star reviews that you can read for yourself along with all the other research and information.
[27:10.000 --> 27:13.000]  Let me read you one of those reviews that's on our site right now.
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.000]  And that's a good way to determine wherever you're buying products.
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.000]  That's one of the things I like at Amazon.com.
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.000]  I can see people's reviews of the product there, and we've done the same thing here.
[27:22.000 --> 27:25.000]  Here's Lydia from Bedford, UK.
[27:25.000 --> 27:28.000]  She says she takes one to two tablets a day.
[27:28.000 --> 27:31.000]  She finds the clarity of thinking has increased massively.
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  So do I.
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  Another one by Blue from Gainesville, Florida.
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.000]  He says, at first I was skeptical because I didn't notice or feel an immediate difference.
[27:39.000 --> 27:43.000]  But after three weeks of daily use, I started to feel razor sharp in the afternoons.
[27:43.000 --> 27:49.000]  After taking Brainforce while eating lunch every day, on days that I did not take the supplement, the intensity was not there.
[27:49.000 --> 27:52.000]  Bottom line, it works, and I have reordered it.
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.000]  And of course, you can take a look at the ingredients.
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  You can do your own research online.
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.000]  You can look at the comments from people on infowarslife.com.
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.000]  And again, we have Brainforce in.
[28:03.000 --> 28:10.000]  Get it while we have it in supply because it went out very, very quickly when we first introduced it and for good reason.
[28:10.000 --> 28:16.000]  Now, Alex was talking about this massive crisis that's going on in Europe.
[28:16.000 --> 28:25.000]  Germany has been the centerpiece of where everybody has been going because Germany is really the victim of political correctness, quite frankly.
[28:25.000 --> 28:31.000]  They've become so sensitive and rightfully so based on what happened with World War II.
[28:31.000 --> 28:39.000]  That they are so eager to prove that they are not like Hitler and the Nazis, that they bend over backwards to take everyone.
[28:39.000 --> 28:42.000]  But you know what? They can't do it. It's not possible.
[28:42.000 --> 28:47.000]  When we come back, we're going to talk about the emergency controls that have been put on in Germany and why.
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.000]  How people in Europe and Munich are saying, how can we cope? They can't cope.
[28:51.000 --> 28:57.000]  We'll be right back to talk about it. Stay with us.
[28:57.000 --> 29:03.000]  Another major health threat. This one in Toledo, Ohio where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[29:03.000 --> 29:06.000]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[29:06.000 --> 29:13.000]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[29:13.000 --> 29:16.000]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[29:16.000 --> 29:19.000]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[29:19.000 --> 29:24.000]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo. You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[29:24.000 --> 29:29.000]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[29:29.000 --> 29:33.000]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[29:33.000 --> 29:36.000]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[29:36.000 --> 29:43.000]  The Pro Pure Pro 1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must have for every modern independently minded household.

[33:01.000 --> 33:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:09.000 --> 33:15.000]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
[33:15.000 --> 33:19.000]  Government is the problem.
[33:19.000 --> 33:27.000]  From time to time we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule.
[33:27.000 --> 33:35.000]  That government by an elite group is superior to government for, by and of the people.
[33:35.000 --> 33:41.000]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind.
[33:41.000 --> 33:47.000]  Hello me, meet the real me and my misfits wave life.
[33:47.000 --> 33:51.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this Sunday, September 13, 2015.
[33:51.000 --> 33:53.000]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[33:53.000 --> 33:59.000]  As we begin the show, Alex is breaking down the news about what is going on in Europe.
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.000]  The massive uncontrolled immigration.
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.000]  I talked about it on the nightly news on Friday night.
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  I talked about the barbarians at the gate.
[34:07.000 --> 34:09.000]  And that's what we're seeing with Western civilization.
[34:09.000 --> 34:14.000]  And that's not calling the people who were fleeing the war that we created in Syria.
[34:14.000 --> 34:16.000]  That's not a reference to them.
[34:16.000 --> 34:19.000]  I'm talking about the way the Roman Empire came down.
[34:19.000 --> 34:27.000]  When people invaded the Roman Empire from outside, those who were there no longer really cared to maintain the Roman Empire.
[34:27.000 --> 34:28.000]  They were fed up with the corruption.
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.000]  They were fed up with the oppression.
[34:30.000 --> 34:32.000]  They really could care less.
[34:32.000 --> 34:38.000]  That's an element that you see right now, but this is also part of political correctness.
[34:38.000 --> 34:41.000]  We see people as I mentioned when we're going to the break in Germany,
[34:41.000 --> 34:46.000]  they were so concerned to show that they are not anything at all like Adolf Hitler,
[34:46.000 --> 34:56.000]  that they will destroy themselves and commit suicide as a nation in order to show how caring and compassionate they are to other people.
[34:56.000 --> 35:02.000]  You can do that without destroying your nation, but they're very concerned about political correctness.
[35:02.000 --> 35:05.000]  And now the suicide pact is political correctness.
[35:05.000 --> 35:10.000]  I understand the popularity of Donald Trump because Donald Trump is a white male.
[35:10.000 --> 35:14.000]  He's actually even rich, and you know what? He's not ashamed of any of it.
[35:14.000 --> 35:20.000]  Maybe he shouldn't brag so much about it, and he would not be as offensive to so many people.
[35:20.000 --> 35:27.000]  But people are so sick and tired of the cowering of the false shame that's being imposed on people.
[35:27.000 --> 35:32.000]  That Donald Trump comes across as very powerful as the antithesis of all this.
[35:32.000 --> 35:37.000]  And of course, people are fed up with the corruption in government.
[35:37.000 --> 35:44.000]  But this is also something that is being manipulated by the elitists, by the globalists who are trying to create a world government.
[35:44.000 --> 35:48.000]  This isn't just a breakdown of society like it was with the Roman Empire.
[35:48.000 --> 35:52.000]  They have already engineered out and have been working for several decades.
[35:52.000 --> 35:58.000]  Going back to the 1950s, we had the plan for the European Union, for the Euro.
[35:58.000 --> 36:06.000]  And of course, economic crises, these kind of immigration crises, and the partnerships that we see that are being collected.
[36:06.000 --> 36:10.000]  They're all part of this globalist plan that we can now see very clearly.
[36:10.000 --> 36:13.000]  We've been telling you how this was designed, how it was engineered.
[36:13.000 --> 36:17.000]  Most people don't want to read the books that Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote.
[36:17.000 --> 36:21.000]  They don't want to look at the mission statements of the Trilateral Commission.
[36:21.000 --> 36:31.000]  Three different blocks around the world that they are now creating so that they can then combine into the next step of global governance.
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.000]  They don't want to look at the blueprints. They don't want to look at the plans.
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  They don't want to understand that none of this stuff happened.
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.000]  I'm not listening. I'm not listening is what the media says.
[36:39.000 --> 36:42.000]  But we can see that it is now playing out.
[36:42.000 --> 36:44.000]  Let's take a look at specifically what's happening now.
[36:44.000 --> 36:48.000]  As you can see that B-roll of the massive influx of people coming in.
[36:48.000 --> 36:55.000]  The people in Germany want to help these people that are suffering severely in this war that we created.
[36:55.000 --> 37:00.000]  But they say, how can we cope? Munich is overwhelmed by the record influx.
[37:00.000 --> 37:05.000]  And as they're saying, scenes of Germans waiting at the Munich station carrying refugees or welcome banners,
[37:05.000 --> 37:09.000]  clutching teddy bears to give weary children their long journey from war and persecution
[37:09.000 --> 37:15.000]  have also become endearing images of an unprecedented migrant crisis hitting Europe.
[37:15.000 --> 37:19.000]  This reminds me of the teddy bears and Glenn Beck going to the border saying,
[37:19.000 --> 37:28.000]  I'm going to go down there and I'm going to help the massive influx of children who have been able to make this journey
[37:28.000 --> 37:35.000]  across Central America through the drug cartels and the terrorism that's going on through that very dangerous thing.
[37:35.000 --> 37:39.000]  These eight-year-olds made this journey so I want to be there at the border with teddy bears for them.
[37:39.000 --> 37:42.000]  I mean, do you really believe that? Glenn Beck really believed that.
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  Do his viewers really believe that these eight-year-olds made this journey?
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.000]  Is he really just enabling human trafficking?
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.000]  See, that's the thing. We can have compassion for people.
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  And there are things that we can do that make sense.
[37:54.000 --> 37:59.000]  But there are things that we can do that don't help them in the long run and destroy us in the near term.
[37:59.000 --> 38:05.000]  If you fly on a plane as I just did on vacation, what do they tell you if the oxygen masks drop down?
[38:05.000 --> 38:10.000]  Because you've got a problem. They say, first, put it on yourself so that you can help other people.
[38:10.000 --> 38:13.000]  It's not being selfish. It's being rational.
[38:13.000 --> 38:17.000]  You have to be able to maintain your consciousness.
[38:17.000 --> 38:21.000]  You have to be able to survive before you can help other people.
[38:21.000 --> 38:25.000]  We can help other people in their countries. We've done that sort of thing in the past.
[38:25.000 --> 38:33.000]  One of the ways that we can help them is by not creating massive civil wars for our geopolitical purposes.
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  That's what our elites have been doing.
[38:35.000 --> 38:39.000]  We create these wars and we say, well, this is a humanitarian issue now.
[38:39.000 --> 38:42.000]  We need to be able to help them.
[38:42.000 --> 38:45.000]  Again, from the Daily Mail, we can't take anymore, they say.
[38:45.000 --> 38:53.000]  Germany stops all trains from Austria as they reintroduce border controls and temporarily suspend the Schengen agreement.
[38:53.000 --> 38:58.000]  They say Munich has become the main entry point. It is now at the breaking point.
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  Remember when Nancy Pelosi went to the border?
[39:00.000 --> 39:05.000]  She said, I wish we could take everyone, all these children.
[39:05.000 --> 39:10.000]  Well, you know, Nancy Pelosi, first of all, has not adopted a single child. Let's understand that.
[39:10.000 --> 39:18.000]  In spite of all the millions of dollars that she has ripped off the American taxpayers with this corrupt system of government that we have,
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.000]  saying that she's doing it in public service, she hasn't adopted a single child.
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.000]  But there's a reason that she can't adopt all of these children personally.
[39:26.000 --> 39:32.000]  With all of her money, with all of her power, Nancy Pelosi cannot adopt thousands of children.
[39:32.000 --> 39:38.000]  And you know what? The United States taxpayer cannot adopt an unlimited number of children,
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  regardless of where they're coming from in the world.
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.000]  And that's what we were saying. It wasn't an anti-Hispanic thing.
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  It did have a thing to do with where they were coming from.
[39:46.000 --> 39:49.000]  We know that there's a massive influx of refugees from China.
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  We're going to have a massive influx from the Middle East.
[39:51.000 --> 39:55.000]  It's the number of people that are coming in. It isn't who they are.
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  We all wish that we could help them.
[39:57.000 --> 40:05.000]  Of course, there's that wonderful story about the guy who's walking along the beach with all the starfish that are on the ocean.
[40:05.000 --> 40:08.000]  And they've washed up and they're dying.
[40:08.000 --> 40:11.000]  And one guy walks over and he picks one and he throws it into the water.
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.000]  And another guy says, what are you doing? You can't save all these starfish.
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.000]  And he goes, I can save that one. I can save that one.
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.000]  We can do that individually. We can do what we can.
[40:24.000 --> 40:31.000]  But we as a nation do not have infinite resources to take everybody in the world here and make them our dependents.
[40:31.000 --> 40:41.000]  And of course, people like Nancy Pelosi are not going to be spending any of their money to take care of these people who are coming in.
[40:41.000 --> 40:45.000]  So where's all this going? We've got two different ways that this is being reported.
[40:45.000 --> 40:50.000]  USA Today takes a look at those who are holding welcoming rallies.
[40:50.000 --> 40:57.000]  They talk about there's tens of thousands of people in London, Madrid, Athens, Budapest, Lisbon, Warsaw, Geneva, Sweden,
[40:57.000 --> 41:01.000]  all part of the solidarity movement supporting the refugees.
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  Fine, fine.
[41:03.000 --> 41:07.000]  Will they bring them to live in their home? Will they adopt them?
[41:07.000 --> 41:12.000]  Or will they put them on the public trough and forget about them and go back to work the next day?
[41:12.000 --> 41:20.000]  Now, the Hungarian Prime Minister and there's several of the Eastern European countries who have recently joined the European Union
[41:20.000 --> 41:25.000]  and they know what it's like to live under deprived conditions.
[41:25.000 --> 41:32.000]  They're living under the former Soviet Union's thumb for a very long time and they do not want to return to those harsh conditions.
[41:32.000 --> 41:37.000]  The Hungarian Prime Minister Orban said there is no fundamental right to a better life.
[41:37.000 --> 41:41.000]  You understand that? There is no fundamental right to a better life.
[41:41.000 --> 41:44.000]  He says there's only a right to security and human dignity.
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  Why do we have governments?
[41:46.000 --> 41:51.000]  In the American system, we had governments we were created to protect our rights.
[41:51.000 --> 41:54.000]  Remember the Declaration of Independence? We have certain inalienable rights
[41:54.000 --> 41:58.000]  that among these are blah, blah, blah, okay, life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.
[41:58.000 --> 42:03.000]  To secure these rights, governments are instituted among men and when they become destructive of those rights,
[42:03.000 --> 42:09.000]  it is our duty and our right to destroy or alter those governments.
[42:09.000 --> 42:13.000]  That's what the Constitution is about. That's what our form of government is about.
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  That's what we said when we declared our independence.
[42:15.000 --> 42:21.000]  We said this is the purpose of government. It is to secure our individual rights.
[42:21.000 --> 42:25.000]  Now, Obama was a constitutional lawyer.
[42:25.000 --> 42:32.000]  He understood and actually talked about the difference between concepts that we've called positive rights and negative rights.
[42:32.000 --> 42:35.000]  Positive rights say that you have a right to something.
[42:35.000 --> 42:38.000]  I have a right to food. I have a right to shelter. I have a right to education. I have a right to all these different things.
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  That means somebody has to provide it for you.
[42:40.000 --> 42:44.000]  That was not what our country was formed on. He knew that.
[42:44.000 --> 42:49.000]  Our country said we have a right to be left alone and we have a right to have a rule of law.
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  Stay with us. We're going to continue with this when we come back.
[43:20.000 --> 43:26.000]  The truth is, the state encourages gender wars.
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.000]  It's a divide and conquer tactic designed to keep us fighting amongst ourselves.
[43:30.000 --> 43:35.000]  In fact, the feminist movement was hijacked by the political class to exploit women.
[43:35.000 --> 43:39.000]  As the late Aaron Russo revealed, the Rockefellers bankrolled feminism.
[43:39.000 --> 43:46.000]  And not because they had any interest in women's rights, but because women in the workforce was the ultimate trifecta.
[43:46.000 --> 43:51.000]  The state collects more tax dollars, children are indoctrinated at an earlier age,
[43:51.000 --> 43:54.000]  and the traditional family structure destroyed.
[43:54.000 --> 44:17.000]  We'll be back at a reporting for infowars.com.
[44:24.000 --> 44:53.000]  We'll be back at a reporting for infowars.com.

[47:01.000 --> 47:14.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:14.000 --> 47:21.000]  Hello, this is Hank Hill and I'm telling you what you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[47:21.000 --> 47:26.000]  In, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in.
[47:26.000 --> 47:40.000]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[47:40.000 --> 47:43.840]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight, your host as we've been
[47:43.840 --> 47:48.700]  talking about in this hour. We're talking about the massive immigration crisis in
[47:48.700 --> 47:52.520]  Europe. I pointed out it's like the barbarians of the gate with Roman Empire.
[47:52.520 --> 47:58.240]  We see that many people in Europe are willing to commit suicide because of a
[47:58.240 --> 48:02.560]  guilt that's been foisted upon them by political correctness. In the United
[48:02.560 --> 48:06.080]  States we see in a recent poll, this is an article that's up on Infowars, we're
[48:06.080 --> 48:10.960]  going to talk about that coming up. We have a third of Americans would support a
[48:10.960 --> 48:17.760]  military coup. This is how bad it's getting. The forces are there for a
[48:17.760 --> 48:22.520]  massive, massive disruption in the West because of course the West needs to be
[48:22.520 --> 48:27.560]  taken down for the globalist plans of what they want to create. That's the
[48:27.560 --> 48:31.840]  only obstacle in their way for global governance are the Western nations. The
[48:31.840 --> 48:35.560]  rest of the countries are already too weak. They've already been taken down by
[48:35.560 --> 48:41.040]  colonial powers, by massive exploitation, by continuous war. So now they need to
[48:41.040 --> 48:44.440]  import that unrest that they've been creating and of course these massive
[48:44.440 --> 48:48.520]  refugees that are flowing out of Syria. That is a direct consequence of our
[48:48.520 --> 48:54.600]  long-term planned foreign policy in the area. You want to talk about how we need
[48:54.600 --> 49:00.040]  to get rid of Syria and Iran? What about Saudi Arabia? They're attacking Yemen in
[49:00.040 --> 49:05.160]  a bloody war with massive civilian casualties there. This is a regime that
[49:05.160 --> 49:09.880]  beheads more people than ISIS does on a regular basis. You carry a Bible in there.
[49:09.880 --> 49:15.240]  You're going to go to prison or worse, far worse in many cases. This is a
[49:15.240 --> 49:19.520]  repressive regime but there are allies. Saudi Arabia. We aren't worried about
[49:19.520 --> 49:26.440]  Saudi Arabia. We're worried about Saudi Arabia's enemies, Syria and Iran, who are
[49:26.440 --> 49:32.600]  not currently invading anybody, any of their any of their neighbors like the
[49:32.600 --> 49:36.400]  Saudis are. But of course we have to destroy that regime because that was
[49:36.400 --> 49:39.760]  our plan of operation. Going way back to what Wesley Clark was talking about. He
[49:39.760 --> 49:43.520]  said we've got this country this guy and it was Syria then Iran and so forth and
[49:43.520 --> 49:47.200]  so on. They had their list. We're going right down the globalist checklist.
[49:47.200 --> 49:51.280]  They're executing the plan, checking off all of the boxes on their plan. We've
[49:51.280 --> 49:54.480]  been telling you about this and their reaction from mainstream media is like
[49:54.480 --> 49:59.320]  what plan? I don't see a plan. Go read their books. Go read what Zabigniew
[49:59.320 --> 50:04.640]  Brzezinski said in 1970. The elites liked it so much they put him in charge of the
[50:04.640 --> 50:09.240]  Trilateral Commission. So they could consolidate the world governance into a
[50:09.240 --> 50:12.920]  European and Asian and a North American bloc and then consolidate those into a
[50:12.920 --> 50:17.440]  global governance. This is where it's all going. Can't you see the plan
[50:17.440 --> 50:22.240]  unfolding now? Can't you see the fact that the unrest that's in the West is
[50:22.240 --> 50:25.800]  something that is right before our very eyes? You need to prepare for yourself.
[50:25.800 --> 50:31.280]  At the very least, there's unrest that is coming in. Prepare for your own. We have
[50:31.280 --> 50:35.640]  Info Wars Life Select that's powered by Pantry at Pantry, a new line of
[50:35.640 --> 50:38.680]  storeable food. We've just introduced it. We have some great deals on it. I tell you
[50:38.680 --> 50:42.600]  it's just traveling. We should have, of course, we went on vacation before they
[50:42.600 --> 50:45.960]  started. I should have gotten some of this stuff and just taken this with us on
[50:45.960 --> 50:52.560]  our road trip because a two-week food supply, $80, that is incredibly cheap.
[50:52.560 --> 50:58.120]  A four-week food supply, $156. They're exclusive slimline totes. You can use it
[50:58.120 --> 51:02.480]  for space-saving packaging. All the packages have ziplocs, so
[51:02.480 --> 51:08.600]  nothing goes to waste. And there's no MSG, no auto-lized yeast extract. It's all
[51:08.600 --> 51:13.200]  US ingredients. It's not made in China. This is made and packaged in the United
[51:13.200 --> 51:18.600]  States. It's not grown or manufactured in China. It's not packaged in China. It's
[51:18.600 --> 51:23.640]  all packaged in the United States. It's got a 25-year shelf life and on and on.
[51:23.640 --> 51:27.760]  You can find this at infowarslife.com. This is a special introductory offer.
[51:27.760 --> 51:32.560]  Incredible prices that we have right now on Info Wars Life Select. That's
[51:32.560 --> 51:38.240]  storeable foods offered by Patriot Pantry. Now going back to the immigration
[51:38.240 --> 51:41.200]  crisis, again, we were talking just before we went to the break about the
[51:41.200 --> 51:46.280]  reports from USA Today, talking about how in the established Western countries
[51:46.280 --> 51:51.080]  of London and capitals like London, Madrid, Athens, Budapest, Lisbon, Warsaw,
[51:51.080 --> 51:58.520]  Geneva, Sweden, they have massive rallies in support of the immigrants. And of
[51:58.520 --> 52:03.240]  course we all understand what's going on there. We all want to help them. But
[52:03.240 --> 52:07.280]  nobody is addressing the root cause. And we'll talk about that in a moment. But
[52:07.280 --> 52:11.200]  then in other countries, and I don't know getting conflicts here because Warsaw
[52:11.200 --> 52:14.160]  is in Poland, Poland is one of the countries, the four countries where
[52:14.160 --> 52:21.560]  there is massive opposition to this unlimited inflow of refugees. Is the
[52:21.560 --> 52:27.440]  Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary? What they're concerned about is the fact
[52:27.440 --> 52:31.160]  and here's the here's the smoking gun again. The fact that this is being
[52:31.160 --> 52:35.720]  foisted upon them by the European Union. The European Union is trying to force
[52:35.720 --> 52:42.080]  nations into accepting unlimited amounts of these refugees. And they're not
[52:42.080 --> 52:46.440]  having it in those four countries. They're having counter demonstrations of
[52:46.440 --> 52:50.920]  tens of thousands of people in those countries. Look at what's going on in
[52:50.920 --> 52:55.560]  Germany. This is an article from Infowars.com. Private property expropriated by
[52:55.560 --> 53:00.640]  the German state for the benefit of the refugees. Now we've already seen this
[53:00.640 --> 53:05.280]  back in May. In Sweden, the migration board in May in Sweden evicted elderly
[53:05.280 --> 53:10.600]  residents from the Milmark Center outside of Torsby, according to a Swedish
[53:10.600 --> 53:14.480]  language daily newspaper. The residents are told that there were plans to make
[53:14.480 --> 53:19.680]  the property an asylum accommodation for refugees. So if you're a retired person
[53:19.680 --> 53:23.440]  in Sweden and they said that they are going to take care of you, they're
[53:23.440 --> 53:26.840]  going to give you these benefits, they've made that social contract with you.
[53:26.840 --> 53:30.040]  You depended upon that and then things change and they throw you out of your
[53:30.040 --> 53:34.480]  home. Quite literally, threw them out of their home to make way for the refugees.
[53:34.480 --> 53:39.440]  That's one of the reasons they say that the anti-immigrant parties and even
[53:39.440 --> 53:43.200]  socialist Sweden are leading in the polls. And of course the same thing is
[53:43.200 --> 53:46.600]  happening in the UK and France and Germany and Austria and other places as
[53:46.600 --> 53:52.880]  the current crop of political leaders do everything they can to subjugate their
[53:52.880 --> 53:57.560]  citizens, to treat their citizens as second-class citizens, to take non-citizens
[53:57.560 --> 54:02.280]  and make them the preferred people because they are the ones who are going
[54:02.280 --> 54:06.680]  to do what they're told. And of course it's going to permit unrest within the
[54:06.680 --> 54:11.120]  country, something that they desperately want to have. This is why you see
[54:11.120 --> 54:15.640]  Donald Trump soaring in the polls because people understand where this is
[54:15.640 --> 54:20.240]  going. Nevertheless, you don't see Donald Trump or many of the others going back
[54:20.240 --> 54:25.800]  to the roots of this crisis. We cannot forget where this came from. This came
[54:25.800 --> 54:31.480]  from a Syrian civil war, the current crisis is a Syrian civil war, which we
[54:31.480 --> 54:37.240]  have been working on for nearly a decade. Starting in 2007, the US was already in
[54:37.240 --> 54:40.240]  the process of engineering the overthrow and destruction of all prevailing
[54:40.240 --> 54:44.520]  political orders across the Middle East and Northern Africa. This is from New
[54:44.520 --> 54:49.480]  Eastern Outlook. Exactly true, the headline is Social Engineering 101 How
[54:49.480 --> 54:54.960]  to Manufacture a Refugee Crisis. And of course we've been telling you this story
[54:54.960 --> 54:59.000]  at Info Wars for a very long time, how the US has engineered this, how they've
[54:59.000 --> 55:02.360]  been meeting with people. For example, John McCain, we've seen all the pictures
[55:02.360 --> 55:05.600]  of John McCain shaking hands with people. As I point out here, he posed for
[55:05.600 --> 55:10.880]  pictures with terrorist leaders from Libya. Libya, you know, 9-11 was the
[55:10.880 --> 55:15.440]  anniversary of Benghazi, not just the attack in New York this last Friday. You
[55:15.440 --> 55:20.000]  didn't hear too much about that, did you? I don't know. We'll see. Maybe there'll
[55:20.000 --> 55:23.560]  be something in these latest Hillary Clinton emails, but we'll talk about
[55:23.560 --> 55:27.360]  Hillary Clinton in a moment. Nevertheless, Northern Africa and the Middle
[55:27.360 --> 55:31.000]  East, that's exactly what they were saying. So he met with leaders in Libya,
[55:31.000 --> 55:34.200]  he met in Syria, and now one of these guys who he was meeting with, remember
[55:34.200 --> 55:37.360]  we talked about it at the time, we knew they were terrorist leaders. This isn't
[55:37.360 --> 55:42.880]  any revelation. They've now openly come out, and one of them is now the head of
[55:42.880 --> 55:48.800]  ISIS in Libya. That's not a surprise. We told you they were already terrorists
[55:48.800 --> 55:53.080]  when he was meeting with them. It isn't blowback. It isn't even bad public
[55:53.080 --> 55:59.080]  policy. This is by design. You need to understand that. It would be bad enough
[55:59.080 --> 56:05.040]  if it was just bad policy, if we were just failing in our policy. And of course,
[56:05.040 --> 56:09.200]  the troubling thing is that we see many people, as Donald Trump began to walk
[56:09.200 --> 56:13.080]  back his comment saying, yeah, you know, I'm against people coming across the
[56:13.080 --> 56:16.480]  border uncontrolled from Central and South America, but we need to bring in
[56:16.480 --> 56:20.320]  those people from Syria because it's a humanitarian crisis. Then he started to
[56:20.320 --> 56:25.760]  walk it back. And he said, well, if I was present, I think what Obama did wrong
[56:25.760 --> 56:30.440]  was he didn't finish off Syria to start with. All that would have done is make
[56:30.440 --> 56:35.440]  the crisis happen even sooner or in a much larger, we don't need to go to war
[56:35.440 --> 56:40.840]  with Syria. They're not attacking anyone. We are the aggressor in Syria. Let's
[56:40.840 --> 56:44.960]  understand that. We walked us back multiple times here at Info Wars. We
[56:44.960 --> 56:49.240]  pointed out multiple false flag attacks. Remember the Seren gas attacks we talked
[56:49.240 --> 56:53.440]  about. We said they're trying to start a war. It got traction. We had people in
[56:53.440 --> 57:00.080]  the military saying, I'm not going to fight for Al Qaeda. We had Ron Paul. We
[57:00.080 --> 57:05.320]  had Rand Paul. We had Dennis Kasinich saying they were not going to be the
[57:05.320 --> 57:09.880]  Air Force for Al Qaeda. People understood what was happening. We stopped them
[57:09.880 --> 57:14.840]  once. We stopped them twice. They continue to press this. They created ISIS. And
[57:14.840 --> 57:18.680]  now we have this massive refugee crisis and we're told that we have to let them
[57:18.680 --> 57:23.280]  overrun our countries. We need to stop the wars. Stay with us. We'll be right
[57:23.280 --> 57:25.480]  back.
[57:25.480 --> 57:28.480]  Yeah.
[57:46.480 --> 57:50.480]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide.

[57:59.280 --> 58:02.720]  mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique
[58:02.720 --> 58:07.200]  shade grown Arabica beans. We have now managed to secure the sought after beans
[58:07.200 --> 58:13.520]  in a highly customized blend. Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend 100%

[58:22.680 --> 58:26.480]  me personally hands down. This is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years
[58:26.480 --> 58:30.960]  to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers dropped by the
[58:30.960 --> 58:34.800]  site today or to a bag or two. And I don't think you're going to be disappointed

[59:50.800 --> 59:56.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:05.200]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:12.680]  information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:18.040]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. We're going to cover some news at the top
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:23.560]  of the hour. We're going to have also a report from Alex Jones joining us in this
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:28.400]  next hour with a special report about the article that Paul Watson put up about
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:32.400]  a top feminist saying that all men need to be put in concentration camps. She
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:36.600]  hopes that heterosexuality doesn't survive. Yes that's the brave new world
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:40.280]  that they're preparing for us. We have to understand that at the bottom rung of
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:47.040]  society. Brave New World is really what we're looking at. All this Huxley's vision
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:51.840]  of an authoritarian government that operates based on controlling the
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:56.840]  population through hedonism and sensuality. The kind of distractions
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:02.280]  that those involve. Basically just keeping them doped up and happy with
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:08.520]  bread and circuses essentially. If there's a group that opposes them however, if
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:12.720]  there's somebody, the people who are awake, who are paying attention, who have
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:17.600]  issues or things, those people are going to get the Orwellia 1984 treatment, the
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:25.680]  boot and the face. So we see both aspects of those novels, those classic dystopian
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:31.320]  novels. Operational today, Alex Jones is going to be talking about the Aldous
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:36.600]  Huxley aspect of this. He won't be putting it in that in that vein I don't
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:40.720]  think but he's going to be talking about this report of this idiotic feminist
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:46.520]  who wants to put men in concentration camps. It's just absolutely insane. Some
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:49.000]  of the other things we're going to be talking about in this hour of course are
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.920]  the massive numbers of people in America who would support a military coup
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:02:00.360]  according to the latest poll. 29% of Americans poll said they would support a
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:05.120]  military coup. We have another article. Psychopaths are running the world as a
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:09.520]  former Marine. We're going to talk about all this as well as a West Point law
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:18.040]  professor who resigned after posting an article in an academic area saying that
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:26.360]  we needed to attack anyone who does not support the war agenda. This is a kind of
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:32.320]  oppression against free speech and free thought that is very very dangerous and
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:36.440]  of course it's interesting to see that they force his resignation. We've had
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:41.760]  former West Point professors. Remember the professor a couple years ago who was
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:48.560]  talking about the hypothetical scenario in South Carolina where he allied the
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:52.640]  Tea Party people with Islamic terrorists. This is somebody who had been
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:57.240]  teaching at West Point for years and years. He was retired. This guy was just
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:00.160]  beginning to teach at West Point. We're going to talk about some of the things
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:04.200]  he said. We're going to talk about the openness of the American people to a
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:09.640]  military coup. Certainly something that I don't want to see but there's also
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:15.160]  another military story that's laying here and that is the massive
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:20.520]  mismanagement again of dangerous select agents that have been brought in. These
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:26.320]  are deadly viruses that have been brought in to be made even more deadly, even more
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.640]  easy to transmit. That's called gain of function and we've had yet another
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:35.380]  shocking mishandling of this. This time it's the black plague as well as an
[01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:39.960]  equine, a couple of different strains of equine and cephalitis which are
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:47.440]  incredibly fatal and very high rate of fatalities for humans who get it. Also
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:54.600]  Sanders is now leading Hillary Clinton in both New Hampshire and Iowa. A big lead
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:58.680]  in as a matter of fact. In New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders is leading Hillary Clinton
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:06.560]  by more than 20 points. That's 52 to 30 percent in New Hampshire. In Iowa he's
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:13.360]  leading her by 10 points, 43 to 33. Her campaign literally is collapsing. We saw
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:17.520]  that the backdrop of the stage there waiting for her to come on. We saw
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:21.240]  that fall over this last week. That was a wonderful metaphor for what's
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:28.320]  going on and it's encouraging to see that there is a blowback against the
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:31.600]  corruption against the lies that we've seen from the Clintons for a very long
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:35.680]  time. This whole idea that she thinks that she is above national security.
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:41.360]  National security has been the cover for everything criminal that the
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:46.240]  government does and yet here's somebody who violates every tenet of national
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:49.600]  security with their private email servers and she's given it a pass. Here's
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:53.400]  what's interesting about the same number of people support Hillary Clinton
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:57.560]  that support a military coup. What does that tell us? We've got some problems in
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:01.720]  America. We'll be right back. For all of recorded history, civilizations around

[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:23.880]  You want to stop tyranny? Well so does he. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:31.480]  Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host on
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:36.080]  this Sunday, September 13, 2015. Alex Jones is going to be joining us in the
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:43.040]  next segment with a special report about a crazy feminist who wants to put all
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:49.080]  men in a concentration camp and hopes to end heterosexuality. Now of course we
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:54.320]  could just dismiss this as her incredible delusions, but there is a wide
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:58.720]  spread movement throughout academia to sell this and has been for many decades.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:03.560]  It is part of the suicide of the West. We see this unfolding with the open
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:06.840]  borders that they cannot bring themselves to oppose because they don't
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:12.520]  want to be accused of being xenophobic or racist. They're being told that we
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:16.520]  have white and European privilege, but that other people have rights. Think
[01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:20.320]  about that for a moment. You understand when we use those two terms, when we
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:24.480]  talk about privilege, when we talk about rights, you understand of course that
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:28.640]  rights are something that you fundamentally possess, but a privilege
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:32.400]  as your nature is a human being. That's why we had the Declaration of
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:36.520]  Independence talking about these rights that we get by nature of us being human.
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:41.840]  But when we talk about privilege, we're talking about licenses and special
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:45.920]  things that are given to us by a government or someone who grants this
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:50.680]  privilege to us, and that of course can be taken away at any time for any
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:57.440]  reason. You don't have a right to move around in this country. We're told, we're
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:03.240]  told that our driver's licenses are privilege. Didn't used to be that way. My
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:06.560]  father was driving when he was eight years old. As soon as he could reach the
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:13.560]  pedals, my grandfather gave him the keys to the car, and it used to be in
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:16.920]  America you didn't have to have a passport across the borders into a
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:20.720]  country. You didn't have to have the permission of your masters to move
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:25.560]  around within the country or across the borders, but now you do. Because now
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:31.000]  everything is a privilege that is granted to us. We don't have fundamental
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.160]  rights unless you're from outside of the country. If you're somebody that the
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:40.160]  government prefers, then they give them rights, but you still get the privileges.
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:43.520]  So we need to understand where this is all coming from. Another couple of
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:48.760]  articles that are up on infowars.com I think are very telling. Drone policing in
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:52.640]  the US is seen as quote-unquote the Wild West. That's what the ACLU calls it. They
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:57.520]  say interconnected drones could enable mass tracking of vehicles and people in
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:00.760]  wide areas. Well, of course they could. That's precisely one of the reasons why
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:05.640]  they're doing it. There is a massive amount of really high-powered drones that
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:11.640]  are being used by the Bureau of Land Management, the beloved BLM. The people
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:15.720]  who stole the tried to steal land from the Bundy's, the Cowboys, they went out
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:20.360]  and they were successful to stealing the land from the Indians with John McCain
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:26.880]  in Arizona, trying to take land from the miners, trying to overturn mining
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:32.880]  agreements and property rights that have been in existence since the 1860s, 1850s
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:39.720]  in many cases. That same agency is mapping out vast areas of the West with
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:44.480]  these drones and of course it isn't just because they're taking inventory of what
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:48.200]  they perceive to be theirs and they will make it theirs. This is also part of
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:52.160]  population control. They want to know everything that you're doing and along
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:57.000]  those lines we reported on Friday about the digital pill. Remember it was on the
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.200]  drudge report, the pill that they can monitor and understand if you have, they
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:04.840]  can track it to make sure that you're taking your medication. The nurse
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:08.000]  ratchet thing, medication time, medication, have you taken your medication?
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.640]  You're not going to be able to slip it under your tongue and then spit it out.
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:14.720]  They're going to monitor it with this digital device. Now there's another
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:20.520]  article that came out today from popular science, embedded 3D barcodes
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:24.280]  to ensure that the pills are real. So we need to make sure that the pills are
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:28.240]  authentic, we need to make sure that you have taken your pills. What's going on
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:34.520]  with this? Being suspicious as I am of people in government, I would say that
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:38.560]  when we look at mandatory insurance, which is unconstitutional, there's
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.920]  nothing in the Constitution that gives the federal government any power to
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:46.160]  mandate insurance, to define what level of insurance we have to buy from the
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:51.680]  crony capitalists that have donated to Obama and to Mitt Romney, but they
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:55.200]  mandated our insurance. They're removing our informed consent when it comes to
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:58.920]  vaccines. They need to have something electronic because, you know, you can
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.920]  shoot the vaccine and that's somebody else does that to you, so they can know,
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:05.480]  they can check off the mark that they have shot that into you, but if they give
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:08.600]  you a bunch of pills, then once you take that on a daily basis, they have to have
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:13.920]  some way to make sure that they're mandating medication for you that you're
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:18.160]  taking it. And of course, to be able to inventory it to make sure that it's
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:21.400]  genuine and not a counterfeit pill as well. And of course, I understand the
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:27.680]  genuine concerns. I understand that there's massive problems with everything
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:31.600]  being counterfeited in China. That's part of the China price. That's something
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:36.400]  that China has been doing for a very long time that gives them an economic
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:39.760]  advantage over other people, and that is counterfeiting, and that's a real danger.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:45.360]  When they make things in China, then of course, some criminal people in China can
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:50.080]  take that same packaging, and they do do this, that same packaging and make fake
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:54.200]  products. We've seen situations like disc brakes that weren't made out of
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:59.040]  brake material, or they were made out of paper. And then people put them in their
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:03.400]  brakes, they can't tell the difference. Their car, their truck crashes, and they
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:08.920]  bought this from an American company, and the packaging all looked authentic, and
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:14.320]  yet it was a counterfeit. It was garbage. And so not only are the American
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:17.520]  companies or the other companies that are manufacturing this stuff in China and
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:22.800]  getting ripped off of that, not only are they losing the sale of this, people
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.740]  think they're buying something authentic and they aren't, they're then facing
[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:31.440]  liability issues. So I understand that Big Pharma wants to make sure that people
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:37.480]  aren't counterfeiting their pills. Nevertheless, when we see embedded 3D bar
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:41.560]  codes to ensure that pills are real, when we see patents to make sure that we've
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:46.040]  got digital pills to know whether or not we're taking our medications, and if
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:50.680]  they hadn't been throwing informed consent under the bus so heavily for the
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:54.280]  last year, then I wouldn't be so suspicious. But when we see a government
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:59.280]  that no longer believes that you are a human being who should make your own
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:02.680]  decisions about your health care and about the health care of your family, I
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:07.480]  find it very troubling to see all of these types of controls being put on
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:12.000]  pills. Now I want to get back to what we were talking about, some of our main
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.240]  thrusts here. We were talking about the massive immigration that's coming in in
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:21.640]  the West. I've mentioned several times about the poll, so as many people are
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:26.480]  supporting a, would support a military coup, about 29% of the people in the
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:31.240]  United States. We have an article up on infowars.com. PsychoPASS are running the
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:34.960]  world, a former U.S. Marine blows a whistle on a Syrian false flag and he
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:39.160]  exposes the real agenda, and he did this a couple of years ago. I want to play you
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:44.200]  a clip from what he said a couple years ago, because this guy lays it out for
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:48.960]  you. What's going on with this? First off, all of these players, these politicians
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:52.440]  are nothing more than puppets. They don't serve the people. There is no real
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:55.760]  democracy. They really serve the rich and powerful who run the world, and that
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:59.800]  would be the bankers who control the money supply. The bankers of course make
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:03.880]  huge amounts of money. Whether they make bad investments or not, wars are great
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:08.360]  for them, and ultimately they control the politicians, and that is why we see
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:13.160]  these policies. Obama and Cameron are nothing more than puppets who read the
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:16.680]  script, and the script is, we need another war. And the reason why we need
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:19.760]  another war, according to these PsychoPASS who are running the world, is
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:23.360]  because more and more people, despite the clueless masses who continue to be
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:27.640]  entranced by things so ridiculous as X-Factor and American Idol, there is
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:31.320]  larger numbers of people around the world who are realizing the truth and
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:35.160]  beginning to recapture the capacity to think for themselves, and they can see
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:39.400]  that these people who are being put in positions of public trust are defying that
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:42.640]  trust and representing an agenda which they could never speak about openly
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:46.560]  because they're nothing more than prostitutes and nothing more than minions
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:51.480]  for the powers that be. Very well said, and of course as a former Marine Ken
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:56.920]  O'Keeffe, he is now an ex-patriot. He is now a citizen of other countries
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:59.920]  because he's so concerned about what's going on in America, and as he points out
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:04.200]  in further remarks, he says we don't operate under law. We have a law of the
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:09.080]  jungle in which the rich and powerful basically determine what goes and what
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:12.400]  doesn't go, and that's what we're seeing happening here. He says the so-called
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:15.680]  war and terror is nothing more than a well-planned strategy to be in a
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:21.040]  perpetual state of war, to destabilize the region for the greater Israel plan
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:28.480]  precisely, and of course for Saudi Arabia as well. It is the Saudi-Israeli axis
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:33.320]  that is running this. It's not the Syrians and Iranians that I believe pose the
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:36.920]  greatest threat to us. They're not the ones, or to the region, certainly they're
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:40.560]  not the ones who are fomenting war. It is the United States and our allies who
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:44.360]  are escalating things. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:01.520]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in. No one has put
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:05.680]  together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:10.040]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time. Just one of the key

[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:12.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:24.200]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones. Alex Jones back
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:28.400]  breaking down some of the latest news and developments. Paul Watson has an
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:33.720]  article in a video up on infowars.com titled top feminist says put all men in
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:38.120]  concentration camps. Journalist also hopes heterosexuality doesn't survive
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:43.400]  and is inherently a bad institution. That's what I've explained here. I'm not
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:48.560]  against or I don't hate people who have other sexual preferences. Quite frankly
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:55.720]  I'm not obsessed with it. I think it's a football issue but the larger situation
[01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:59.400]  behind it is not just bread and circus not just a distractionary political
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:04.200]  issue from other bigger issues. It's the fact that as we cover in my film in game
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:10.240]  1.5 an online update the university papers are clear from the 60s the plan
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:15.200]  to not just get women on the workforce of the state raises the kids but to then
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:19.600]  start breaking up the family itself and if you're able to do that it's game over
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:25.680]  and this lady in multiple articles that Watson quotes and in other states
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:29.520]  statements says hey I'm serious many do you put in reeducation camps
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:34.840]  heterosexuality is bad period men are bad I hate men and you can go read her
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:39.960]  quotes and this is probably one of the top 10 so-called feminist out there and
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:45.000]  if you look at these top feminists they're all the same just power crazed
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.800]  weirdos that look like men themselves and so I guess she needs to be the first
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:58.000]  person to put herself in a reeducation camp but this is the state and social
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:03.600]  engineers getting in between not the oldest human institution the oldest
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:08.760]  institution of life is reproduction between male and female whether it's
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:16.560]  insects or fish or amphibians or mammals or marsupials it's not sexist at
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:23.160]  the duck bill platypus is male or female it's not bad that I breathe oxygen and
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:28.840]  exhale carbon dioxide it's not bad the sky is blue these people literally are
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:32.600]  the biggest con artist on earth in my view because they triple and quadruple
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:38.000]  down and just say we're gonna tell you how to talk no more he she no more man
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.640]  woman no more husband wife because it hurts people's feelings we're gonna
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:49.160]  tell you no more sports and schools no more contact no more tag no more dodge
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:52.680]  ball no more competition because that hurts somebody's feelings and somebody
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:57.880]  loses these people are scientifically creating a culture of jellyfish that can
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:03.240]  be overwritten and destroyed and once the family the basis of the nucleus to
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:09.120]  set up a camp to set up an operation you know a good camp of gardens and farming
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:14.880]  and machine shops and working with others once that human basic building
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:18.480]  block has been destroyed the globals have taken over and I've said this
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:24.800]  hundreds of times I'll say it again if I was an alien species studying the
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:30.560]  planet earth from afar like looking at microbes under a petri dish through a
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:36.480]  microscope this is exactly how I take down the planet how I take down humans
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:40.680]  and I would also come in with genetically engineered plants so that
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:44.320]  plants wouldn't reproduce anymore I would come in and fundamentally change
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:49.040]  the atmosphere with the chemtrailing with the geoengineering I would
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:52.840]  fundamentally do what we see happening and the truth is I don't believe it's
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:58.160]  space aliens carrying this out but it's humans that are psychopathic served by
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:03.320]  sociopaths who hate goodness and hate the basic order of the world and want to
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:06.920]  play God and that's what they're doing they destroy the environment with
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:10.680]  glyphosate and GMO and then tell us carbon dioxide the plants breathe is
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:16.680]  bad and we've all got to be tracked in tax because we're all guilty they
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:21.240]  radicalized Islam bringing into the west to rape kill and murder and then arrest
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:26.480]  anybody protesting against it again it is an upside down reality and these
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:30.320]  people know they're totalitarians they know they're hateful they know it's
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:33.920]  social engineering I've read their textbooks I've read their writings I
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:39.720]  mean I remember 15 years ago 16 years ago being mailed a copy of the major
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:44.040]  textbook used for social services in college and I showed it on air and
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:48.560]  people didn't believe it and it said the family belongs to the dark ages the
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:52.520]  family belongs to prehistoric times I mean I'm quoting it exact as I've
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:57.320]  quoted it so many times dark ages prehistoric times before that it must
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:02.800]  be eradicated so when Melissa Harris Perry gets up on MSNBC and a promo and
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:06.160]  says we're gonna go over the idea that your kids belong to you they belong to
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:11.160]  you know the collective or the state you've got to understand folks they they
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:15.080]  mean business they mean to forcibly inoculate you and your family they
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:19.520]  mean to force you to eat GMO they mean to open our borders up and raise our
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:24.160]  taxes and track everything we do with all smart this smart that but if we turn
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:27.520]  against this as a civilization as a culture it's game over for the new
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:31.760]  world order info wars.com and prison planet.com of the front lines of fighting
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:36.760]  these hardcore tyrants who set themselves up and say we want to quality we want to
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:39.760]  be nice to you we want to do as we say and then as soon as they get their
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:45.040]  police state in place they go take over revolution get rid of the police you
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:48.960]  know world government get rid of men get rid of father and mother get rid of
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:54.000]  brown bags do what we say we're in control and it just keeps doubling and
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.800]  tripling down and people say it's over the top but this is the point it's the
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:04.080]  overton window where they move it so far towards insanity that it just changed
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:08.720]  our whole perspective and folks tend if the lies so big to just submit to it
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:12.120]  that's what we got to be hardcore and point out how sick they are to pull it
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:16.720]  back and get through this learned helplessness or the mass Stockholm
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:20.480]  syndrome the term I've going to Stockholm syndrome of course was discovered
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:24.520]  back in the was the 60s where lady was kidnapped and they ended up serving the
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:29.560]  kidnappers but it's been around forever that's just a clinical term for it where
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:33.920]  people tend to adapt to their captors and women are wonderful resilient smart
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:39.840]  creatures but they're designed more than men to adapt into oppression that's what
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:43.640]  slave boats coming in from West Africa or with the Romans when they bring in
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:47.000]  slaves out of Germany the handbooks have been written so they would always just
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:52.640]  kill all the men the old men 13 and older generally the Romans would kill them
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:57.080]  the Jews considered you to be a man when you were 13 as well the Romans did as
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:01.240]  well in the old world it was 13 not just not just in Israel and they'd kill
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:05.000]  everybody 13 and up that's why you always hear about Pharaoh says kill all
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:10.160]  the male child I mean it's it's the state is a bunch of powerful men the
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:13.920]  Pharaoh's a man but he understands that it's a bunch of young men that are his
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:17.680]  problem and that's why they're flooding Europe with mainly 90% combat age
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:22.640]  military age men is these will be the leftist jihad force with the left
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:27.440]  getting in with radical Islam to bring down the West this is the ultimate

[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:19.880]  that architects of authoritarian societies have always proposed going back
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:24.560]  to Plato's Republic taking a look at Huxley's brave new world they always

[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:04.200]  country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called stingrays
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:09.160]  which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:15.840]  without warrants the technology comes courtesy of the FBI who have forced our
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:20.720]  nation's police departments into signing non-disclosure agreements forbidding
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:25.320]  them from publicly talking about the technology needless to say this is a
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:29.760]  direct violation of our fourth amendment and they have no legal authority
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:34.320]  for warrantless stingray spying where we now know that police are collecting
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:39.240]  information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of

[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:26.680]  network welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight your host this
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:30.160]  segment i want to talk about something we touched on a little bit earlier
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:35.800]  liberty versus licensing you know when they give you a license when they give
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:40.160]  you a privilege they can take that away at any time they can control everything
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:45.840]  that you do they deny that you have certain inalienable rights whether it's
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:49.960]  moving about freely in the country or whether it's engaging in a in a business
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:52.960]  always thought it was interesting when i had a business that i had to buy a
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:57.280]  privilege license every every kind of business has to get a privilege license
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:01.480]  i said to my wife you know it's interesting having a business and
[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:06.880]  working is a privilege but collecting welfare is right doesn't that seem kind
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:10.440]  of upside down here we've got a situation personal trainers they say are
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:15.120]  sweating as washington dc ready's new rules when i first saw this from Reuters
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:19.120]  i thought whoa are they gonna is is washington now going to try to license
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:23.840]  all personal trainers will not just yet this is something that is just the city
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:28.520]  of washington the district of criminals they're saying that the capital city is
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:31.320]  preparing to regulate personal fitness trainers in a move that could ripple
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:37.160]  through the country's booming 24 billion dollar gem industry and his fight
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:42.040]  against flab you know that's the key right there 24 billion dollars that's a
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:47.760]  lot of money and i can guarantee you that the politicians want to get a piece
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:52.240]  of that action it's just like the mafia that's the way they operate and they go
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:54.840]  through the old streets of new york and they see a guy with a business and they
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:58.320]  say you know you got a great business here it'd be a shame if anything would
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:01.920]  have happened to it why don't you pay me for some protection money and of course
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:06.320]  they're going to protect you from themselves okay that's that's what
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:09.240]  you're getting protection from and so now they're saying that they have to take
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:14.120]  personal trainers and they have to license and look understand the personal
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:17.280]  trainer could have you do too much exercise or could have you do an
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:22.040]  exercise it's inappropriate for you whatever caveat emptor let the buyer
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:26.160]  beware take a look at this guy's credentials get to know them if they're
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:28.680]  telling you to do stuff that's not comfortable for you don't do it whatever
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:33.080]  but you could make this argument about anything you could make this argument
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:37.680]  about the guy who's mopping the floor is that he needs to have a federal license
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:41.320]  from the government because he might leave the floor wet and not put up a sign
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:45.560]  and somebody could fall and become paralyzed and I'm sure they could get a
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:49.720]  have a congressional hearing where they could parade people before congressmen
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:54.080]  and say yes Sally slipped on the wet floor and she broke her back and now
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:58.120]  she's living in a life of misery and paralysis and so we need to license all
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:02.160]  floor moppers from the federal government and so this is where this is all
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:08.480]  headed but let's look at something else that is going to hit us all much more
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:13.040]  directly and that is our ability to move around without the government's
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:17.960]  permission without making it a privilege now you may think that it'd be
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:23.360]  great when you have a self-driving car we know that the head of uber has said
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:27.480]  that eventually everybody's going to be driving around in the cars that he owns
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:31.760]  private ownership he says is going to go away once we have autonomous driving
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:36.400]  cars it'll go away for everybody of course except for uber CEO Travis
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:39.720]  Kalalnik okay he's gonna own all the cars he'll be the only one with private
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:43.880]  ownership of cars and of course he'll be operating it in conjunction with the
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:48.600]  bureaucrats and a kind of fascist economic system because that's what it is
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:51.920]  chronic capitalism let's call it what it is it's fascism okay it's economic
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:55.600]  fascism they're not waving the flag and doing the kind of stuff that Hitler
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:37:00.400]  did no economic fascism says that you know you've got this this agreement
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:04.920]  between the corporations and between government they have private property but
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:10.200]  only for the privileged and those people use it in a way that reinforces the
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:14.400]  power of those who are rulers that's the kind of crony capitalism that we're
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:17.440]  going to have in this country and of course the what we're looking at with
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:21.960]  our transportation system now the uber CEO was just on the late show with
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:26.040]  Stephen Colbert he just began this this last week and he's had a very powerful
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:30.560]  lineup of I guess in the last week I want to play you this clip when Stephen
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:35.800]  Colbert talked to him about concerns that people had in the competition between
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:41.960]  licensed taxi drivers and uber which doesn't have to get a license from the
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:46.960]  cities that they operate in here's what the uber CEO said
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:53.360]  taxi driver spends $40,000 a year renting a car that should be a Bentley that
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:56.600]  you're riding around it but instead it goes to a taxi owner who owns the
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:00.840]  license to own and operate a cab in the uber world you can use your own car you
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:06.760]  don't pay $40,000 to rent a vehicle you make more dollars per hour and it's
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:10.000]  flexible that is one of the most dishonest things you'll ever hear from
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:14.120]  anybody he he says you have to pay the taxi company if you're a taxi driver you
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:19.320]  got to pay the taxi company $40,000 to rent that taxi and of course all that
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:24.000]  money goes to the taxi company that is a lie and he knows it
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:30.560]  taxi medallions are something that the taxi companies buy from the local
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:35.840]  governments and of course it is incredibly regulated it has been a
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:40.000]  nexus of corruption in most of the states and that's one of the reasons why
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:45.680]  you've seen so many people who typically support free markets and and
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:50.240]  siding with uber and I think they're wrong to do it this is not the jitney
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:55.280]  taxi situation many many years many decades ago we had situations that
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:39:00.200]  arose in minority communities they were called jitney taxis and these were
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:03.880]  dangerous perceived to be dangerous minority neighborhoods that the regular
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:09.160]  taxis the licensed taxis would not go into and so you had some entrepreneurs
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:12.800]  some minority entrepreneurs who said I'll I'll provide a taxi service to the
[01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:16.160]  people who live in my community I'm not if I live here I'll do it so they
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:20.920]  created these jitney taxis they were not licensed okay they didn't have a big
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:24.520]  wall street backer behind them like uber but they were not licensed they
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:29.400]  didn't buy these expensive medallions from the city of New York for $40,000 a
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:34.880]  year they were driven out of business even though the other companies didn't
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:38.040]  want to go in there because the government is a protection racket it
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:42.520]  wants everybody to operate and buy their licenses from them and when he talks
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:48.240]  about the $40,000 license that is really disingenuous and a lie Stephen
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:52.160]  Colbert did not call him on that that $40,000 I don't know how much that the
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:56.440]  taxi licenses but the bulk of that is going to go to the city then ask
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:40:03.440]  yourself why is the city of New York not charging uber for those licenses time
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:09.840]  is up because they want uber to take over all private transportation and set up a
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:13.480]  control grid government has been trying to control our transportation
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:16.200]  especially starting in the inner cities for a very long time that's what all
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:21.120]  these boondoggle rail systems are about they want to control our
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:25.240]  transportation this is something that goes back many many decades our
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:29.640]  interstate system was essentially set up initially so that the military could
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:33.800]  use it to move about quickly just as Hitler created the first autobahn the
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:37.920]  predecessor to our system so the military could use it it's always been
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:41.600]  about control maintaining control and making sure that they're in control but
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:45.600]  also controlling the population they use it to enforce a 55 mile an hour speed
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:50.240]  limit that is nothing compared to what's coming down the pike when we look at
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:55.600]  agenda 21 they want to confine people into small areas inside the cities this
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:00.240]  is a United Nations agenda for the 21st century one of the ways you have or
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:04.040]  you're going to do that is to make sure that people can't easily travel outside
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:07.560]  of those areas you're going to make it difficult for them to do that you're
[01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:11.320]  going to make it difficult for people to live in the suburbs they hate the
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:15.840]  suburbs they want to concentrate people because it works to their control and if
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:22.840]  they can get a CEO like uber to be uber the regulations above the regulations
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:28.120]  above all transportation to own all private cars that is precisely what
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:32.120]  they want that person then they can deal with that's somebody that they can
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:36.360]  control they can make arrangements with that will be a way for them to control
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:39.600]  your transportation and of course if they have a highway grid where they're
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:43.920]  constantly monitoring your cars seeing how fast you're driving where you're
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:47.080]  going I mean we know that the government wants to know everything about us they
[01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:50.720]  want to be able to tax us by the mile there's so many different aspects of
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:56.360]  this but we've even seen them selling the idea that ubers taxis are going to
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:42:00.840]  save the planet because somehow they're going to use less carbon dioxide than
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:06.160]  regular cars do so the fix is in and it's kind of interesting because there's
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:11.160]  also this other side uber where you got now an article from W&D kidnappers and
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:15.720]  perverts are posing as uber drivers because you don't see the marked taxi
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:19.160]  people are using their personal cars essentially how do you know you call uber
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:22.680]  and a guy pulls up they see somebody who is looking for uber and they just say
[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:27.600]  yeah that's me and then they get the kids into their car and that's what we've
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:33.480]  had happen several times but what's really going on is uber is posing as a
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:37.800]  free-market solution and it is nothing of the sort they're being given for the
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:43.880]  time being a special entry into this market giving a competitive advantage
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:47.360]  because they don't have to pay those licensing fees and you need to ask
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:52.320]  yourself why is that happening stay with us we'll be right back

[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:40.560]  welcome back to the alex jones show on this Sunday September 13th 2015 I'm
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:45.520]  David Knight this is our final segment of the show now of course today is the
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:51.560]  cusp of a couple of Jewish feasts they have the year of jubilee is just ending
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:55.440]  and and the time celebrating that and we're about to go into another one the
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:48:00.800]  feast of trumpets course the year jubilee was a a great tradition actually
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:05.240]  part of the Judaic law that God gave them in the Old Testament 49 years every
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:09.760]  49 years they would release people from their indebtedness people who were
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:14.200]  indentured servants and of course they called them slaves but they didn't have
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:18.240]  the kind of perpetual generational slaves that we have had in the west like
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:23.360]  we had in the south prior to their emancipation they would be people who
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:26.720]  were indentured servants so people many people came to the United States that
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:29.840]  way as indentured servants that they have to work that off but every 49 years
[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:33.440]  they would be they'll be released these people were free that's why they called
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:37.880]  it the year of jubilee a lot of people see these biblical prophecies the Hebrew
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:41.040]  calendar we've talked about this repeatedly on the info wars show as
[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:46.840]  well as many economic forecasters have seen the cycles that have been
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:50.080]  repeating with this this is an article out of the Salt Lake Tribune talking
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:53.800]  about Mormons who are stocking up say some Mormons are stocking up in the
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:57.200]  fears at doomsday could come this month they say of course they're called
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:00.600]  preppers oh that's a new term we haven't heard that before have we they're
[01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:04.000]  buying up food storage kits they say flashlights blankets tents some are
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.160]  even bracing to leave their homes if need be at one of these places where
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:11.600]  they're selling freeze-dried food they say cells are shot up 500% or more in
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:14.720]  the past a couple of months they say there's a sense of urgency like
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:17.800]  something is up a lot of people are mentioning things about September like a
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:22.720]  financial collapse and we've had multiple economic forecasters predicting
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:25.880]  that independent of any biblical prophecies or whatever so there's a
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:30.200]  sense that we need to prepare of course we always need to be prepared nobody
[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:33.640]  has done this better than the Mormons historically they have always
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:37.760]  collectively come together with food storage and other things to prepare for
[01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:42.240]  what they perceive might be emergencies but now it's taken on a new sense of
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:47.760]  urgency interestingly enough we have set up at this time a new product
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:52.880]  line at info wars life select we have storeable food that we're doing in
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:57.240]  conjunction with Patriot Pantry again this is excellent packaging that you'll

[01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:12.320]  presidential race of course we're going to have the debate this Wednesday at the
[01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:16.160]  same time we kick off the info wars money bomb we're going to be covering that
[01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:20.000]  debate and commenting on what happens with it live we're going to be doing I
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:26.440]  think it's 27 hours live broadcast marathon beginning on Wednesday at 11
[01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:31.520]  o'clock and going through the next day and right in the middle of that we're
[01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:35.320]  going to have the next presidential debate it's going to be carried at CNN of
[01:51:35.320 --> 01:51:39.480]  course Rick Perry did not make the debate he dropped out on Friday here's a
[01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:46.560]  clip of Rick Perry as he dropped out what he had to say I would rather one state
[01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:51.520]  get it wrong than the entire country and that's our point with the 10th
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:56.920]  amendment today Washington has discarded that 10th amendment it's been
[01:51:56.920 --> 01:52:02.880]  centralizing government for generations now failing to meet the test of
[01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:09.080]  leadership it is time for us to elevate this debate from divisive name
[01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:14.880]  calling from sound bites without solutions and start discussing how we will
[01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:21.760]  make the country better for all if a conservative is elected president today
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:30.240]  I submit to you his will remains a mystery but some things have come and
[01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:38.800]  become very clear to me that is why today I am suspending my campaign for the
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:45.040]  presidency of the United States so there you go as I guess he would say you
[01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:49.600]  won't have Ronald Raven to kick around anymore seriously though the discussion
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:52.040]  that he had there at the beginning of that about the 10th amendment that was
[01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:55.720]  very valuable I wish we had those kinds of discussions on the debates you won't
[01:52:55.720 --> 01:53:00.360]  hear those kinds of questions most likely asked instead it will be how many
[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:04.760]  jobs are you going to create do you realize how idiotic most of the
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:09.120]  presumptions of the mainstream media has of course we're going to be safe and
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:14.480]  secure we're going to achieve peace through having multiplied wars right
[01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:18.520]  we're going to create war everywhere so that we can all be more secure we're
[01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:24.320]  going to give unlimited access to a secretive closed police state so we can
[01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:28.520]  all be more secure and of course we're going to give all power to Washington
[01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:31.600]  that's one of the messages that Rick Perry had out I wish he had gotten
[01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:36.120]  traction for that message that was an important message but we and we hope
[01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:43.160]  that the CNN debate will not be along the lines of the of the Kelly debate
[01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:47.080]  going back and forth with personal attacks on people that we saw with
[01:53:47.080 --> 01:53:50.960]  Donald Trump hopefully there'll be something that is of substance and not
[01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:55.360]  just a celebrity big brother because that's what this is really boiled down
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:54:00.160]  to this is really about a reality TV show this is the way that Fox News has
[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:04.360]  done it and I don't expect anything any different from CNN I expect to hear the
[01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:10.040]  same tired litany of issues repeated over and over and over again and all
[01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:13.200]  these debates and they don't have anything new to say and there's going to
[01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:18.560]  be a lot of issues issues that are that would affect limiting the power of
[01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:21.920]  central government you're not going to hear those talked about you didn't hear
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:25.120]  the 10th Amendment talked about as as Rick Perry pointed out here's what
[01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:30.560]  Donald Trump has to say about Rick Perry leaving mr. Perry governor Perry he's
[01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:36.200]  gone good luck oh he was very nasty to me but you know yesterday I put out a
[01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:39.840]  tweet I said he's a wonderful man and I wish him well couldn't people couldn't
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:44.280]  believe but you know when you win everybody's wonderful right and I think
[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:48.200]  he's one I think he's actually a nice guy but he dropped out so we have a total
[01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:54.560]  of 16 people people don't have energy I don't think Ben has the energy Ben is a
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:59.560]  nice man but when you're negotiating against China and you're negotiating
[01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:04.080]  against these Japanese guys that are going to come at you in waves and they
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:07.920]  think we're all a bunch of jerks because our leaders are so stupid and so
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:13.400]  incompetent and so inept we need people that are really really smart and
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:19.920]  competent and can get things done we need people we would let's leave it right
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:23.800]  there we never get the idea that we've got leaders that are incompetent and
[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:31.480]  stupid well this is not a contest we see them demanding loyalty owes from Donald
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:34.720]  Trump in the first debate I would like to see some loyalty owes to the
[01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:39.640]  Constitution how about that how about a gotcha question on the Constitution can
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:43.600]  they name one amendment and what is about and they don't exclude the first
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:47.480]  and second amendment can you name one other amendment that is in the Bill of
[01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:51.240]  Rights and explain what's in it you don't even have to quote it just name one
[01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:54.160]  other one I mean that would be what I would ask them but of course we're not
[01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:58.080]  even going to get to that level we're not even to the level of a junior high
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:03.000]  school civics class here this is talking about people's energy yeah he was very
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.920]  mean to me he was very you know he's somebody I'm glad to see him go well
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:11.000]  here's where the latest horse races at this moment we've got as I mentioned
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:15.120]  earlier in the program Hillary Clinton fortunately is dropping on the Democrat
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:20.960]  side Bernie Sanders I'm not any big fan of Bernie's but I'm glad to see Hillary
[01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:25.440]  you know she needs to be going to prison as we have the info wars t-shirt that
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:30.720]  says Hillary for prison in 2016 that's precisely who she needs to be not in the
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:35.600]  White House but in the big house she is down by 20 points in New Hampshire to
[01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:40.200]  Bernie Sanders she's down by 10 points in Iowa to Bernie Sanders and the thing
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:44.560]  to me that is amazing is that with all of these issues with all this arrogance
[01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:49.640]  is that she still has 30% we support in those two areas that is pretty amazing
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:52.840]  to me of course there's not that many people running on the Democrat side on
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:57.640]  the Republican side it truly is like celebrity big brother my wife didn't
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:00.360]  know what that program was and I've never watched it we've never watched this
[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:04.200]  these big brother programs I had explained to her that you know one guy
[01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:07.720]  leaves every week or something like that you know and they and they put that
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:12.520]  out I think it was a deliberate predictive programming by the BBC to get
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:17.920]  people accustomed to the idea that hey I could be a celebrity if I get into this
[01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:22.800]  kind of voyeuristic social media and I put my life out there on social media
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:27.400]  and of course that is what we've been living with for the last couple of
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:32.760]  decades is a kind of I want to be a big brother celebrity and who better to do
[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:37.680]  this than a TV personality like Donald Trump and of course he's leading in the
[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:41.120]  polls will be talking about that more this week stay with us and we'll have
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:46.080]  debate coverage this Wednesday as part of our info wars money bomb beginning on
[01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:48.360]  Wednesday
