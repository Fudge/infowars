[00:00.000 --> 00:13.560]  Big Brother, mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[00:13.560 --> 00:26.640]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:26.640 --> 00:34.440]  Brigitte Jones-Dautier, a member of the Icelandic Parliament, will be joining us today in the
[00:34.440 --> 00:42.520]  third hour as they fight the British banking takeover of their entire nation. This is public,
[00:42.520 --> 00:49.640]  economic, conquest, and warfare going on in the last two years against Iceland, and they
[00:49.640 --> 01:00.580]  are fighting back. We have Catherine Austin-Fitz to give us her expert analysis on what's
[01:00.580 --> 01:10.560]  happening with the Bankster Gate and the economy in the last hour. And finally, coming up in
[01:10.560 --> 01:17.520]  the noontime hour, or hour number two, Tyrell Ventura will be joining us to talk about the
[01:17.520 --> 01:23.880]  final episode of the hit show Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura. He is the son of former
[01:23.880 --> 01:34.200]  Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura. So that is coming up in the second hour. And I'm going to
[01:34.200 --> 01:43.760]  spend about five minutes with Greg in Houston. He's the individual last week that confronted
[01:43.760 --> 01:52.760]  George Bush Sr. And I was sent this video. My office was sent it on, I guess, the eighth.
[01:52.760 --> 02:02.360]  And we get so much information that Rob forgot to tell me about it. But Rob wasn't even sure
[02:02.360 --> 02:07.600]  because the fellow sent us a little bitty video thumbnail of it so he could quickly
[02:07.600 --> 02:15.120]  get it to us. And Rob couldn't make out that it was George Herbert Walker Bush, the 41st
[02:15.120 --> 02:25.880]  President of the United States, in a pizza place. And I tell you, this guy has got a
[02:25.880 --> 02:37.280]  lot of nerve, nerves of steel to say what he said to George Bush Sr. And we can't play
[02:37.280 --> 02:43.600]  the video or audio here. He's cussing at him. But it's one of the number one videos.
[02:43.600 --> 02:51.880]  It's in the top 10 of YouTube right now. And Brett Bart TV picked it up yesterday. Drudge
[02:51.880 --> 03:01.760]  linked to it. And I'm still just processing it. The Secret Service, by the way, did come
[03:01.760 --> 03:14.560]  to his house. And I want to warn this guy about the Bushes when we talk to him in the
[03:14.560 --> 03:22.640]  next segment. If I sounded a bit out of it or more hoarse in the last couple weeks, we're
[03:22.640 --> 03:30.680]  having record cedar fever in Austin, record amounts of pollen. And Austin is the capital
[03:30.680 --> 03:34.680]  of allergies in the United States. It's rated by all the different medical services as the
[03:34.680 --> 03:42.520]  worst allergy city in the country because of the different types of flora and fauna
[03:42.520 --> 03:52.880]  that are in this area. So many different varieties of plants and trees. So if you hear me pausing
[03:52.880 --> 03:56.560]  occasionally, it's because I'm hitting the cough button and having a sneezing fit. I'm
[03:56.560 --> 04:08.800]  fighting one back right now. But a jam-packed radio transmission lined up for you today.
[04:08.800 --> 04:15.680]  Very impressed with the great work that my producers are doing. The fellas, Jared and
[04:15.680 --> 04:21.040]  Ryan and Craig that are in there running the show Monday through Friday and then coming
[04:21.040 --> 04:27.400]  in on Sundays. They all run the video cameras for prismplanet.tv. They all run the audio
[04:27.400 --> 04:33.320]  board. They set up the gas. They all work as a really great close-knit team. And that's
[04:33.320 --> 04:38.000]  the best producers I've ever had and the best integrated team when they're just getting
[04:38.000 --> 04:44.200]  better and better. So we've got a member of the Icelandic parliament fighting the bankers.
[04:44.200 --> 04:49.280]  Coming up, we've got Catherine Austin Fitz and we have Tyrell Ventura. We talk about
[04:49.280 --> 04:54.720]  the hit TV show Conspiracy Theory and what that means as a society that this show is
[04:54.720 --> 05:00.680]  a hit and that they even allowed it on air. Stay with us.
[05:00.680 --> 05:05.280]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[05:05.280 --> 05:09.720]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be
[05:09.720 --> 05:14.880]  all I can get. In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your
[05:14.880 --> 05:20.360]  only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts?
[05:20.360 --> 05:24.960]  When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food?
[05:24.960 --> 05:29.000]  Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.280]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems
[05:33.280 --> 05:38.320]  if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your
[05:38.320 --> 05:43.280]  life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm
[05:43.280 --> 05:51.680]  Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633
[05:51.680 --> 06:02.120]  or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[06:02.120 --> 06:06.640]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[06:06.640 --> 06:12.160]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, we'll be pulling the rug
[06:12.160 --> 06:16.960]  from underneath the Americans at home. I've turned an innocent influence on our president
[06:16.960 --> 06:22.160]  in Congress, and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of
[06:22.160 --> 06:27.680]  us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies
[06:27.680 --> 06:33.240]  of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[06:33.240 --> 06:37.600]  its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and their arsonists,
[06:37.600 --> 06:41.840]  they're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[06:41.840 --> 06:47.840]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[06:47.840 --> 06:54.160]  of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're
[06:54.160 --> 07:00.120]  watching online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[07:00.120 --> 07:04.360]  Hi everyone, Andy Anderson here. Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill
[07:04.360 --> 07:09.120]  germs, bacteria, and other nasties? In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy
[07:09.120 --> 07:13.160]  doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day. Did you know that once the
[07:13.160 --> 07:17.560]  alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, goodbye effectiveness. No more protection till you
[07:17.560 --> 07:22.360]  use it again. Pure works to the rescue. Our FDA compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray
[07:22.360 --> 07:27.480]  do not contain alcohol. Their killing power lasts up to four hours. Pure works disinfecting

[07:38.360 --> 07:42.080]  moles and fungus too. It's even safe around pets and children. You'll love how your skin
[07:42.080 --> 07:46.240]  fills with pure works soft and supple. No more dry skin. Here's to a little piece of

[07:59.840 --> 08:15.920]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Coming up in the
[08:15.920 --> 08:23.680]  third hour, Brequette Jones Duttiere for Jones Daughter, one of the leaders in the Icelandic
[08:23.680 --> 08:29.600]  Parliament against the hostile banking takeover of their entire nation. See, the big banks
[08:29.600 --> 08:34.720]  are now gobbling up first world countries and old world countries. They're not just
[08:34.720 --> 08:39.160]  wrecking third world countries by design and that's all public record. They're now doing
[08:39.160 --> 08:46.120]  that to England, to the United States, to Western European countries and the people
[08:46.120 --> 08:50.760]  of Iceland have been valiantly fighting. So I'm really looking forward to this interview
[08:50.760 --> 08:56.520]  coming up. Also, Catherine Austin Fitz on the whole banking scam on the latest on Bankster
[08:56.520 --> 09:00.760]  Gate with little Timmy Geithner in danger of being criminally indicted. That's in the
[09:00.760 --> 09:05.280]  last hour Tyrell Ventura, son of Jesse Ventura will talk about is his dad going to run for
[09:05.280 --> 09:11.040]  president in 2012. We're going to talk about the final episode of the hit TV show conspiracy
[09:11.040 --> 09:16.160]  theory that I appear in many episodes of and consult on. I've been told if it gets picked
[09:16.160 --> 09:19.880]  back up that I'm going to be a big part of the show, a even bigger part. I'm very excited
[09:19.880 --> 09:24.040]  about that. This is trailblazing, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that this is being allowed
[09:24.040 --> 09:29.440]  on air and that it's from our perspective and point of view. Okay, I'm not going to
[09:29.440 --> 09:35.680]  play the video or audio because there is some profanity in it. Obviously to get the courage
[09:35.680 --> 09:40.760]  up to confront the 41st president known as one of the most vindictive and dangerous people
[09:40.760 --> 09:48.080]  out there. I can't judge him for cussing at him. I probably wouldn't have done that while
[09:48.080 --> 09:55.040]  I have confronted George W. Bush and been arrested for it for politely saying sir and
[09:55.040 --> 10:03.600]  asking him a question at the end of a speech when he was supposed to have a press conference
[10:03.600 --> 10:09.240]  to try to get into the danger of the Bush family. We really have Greg on here because
[10:09.240 --> 10:12.800]  he's a listener and he first contacted us and it fell through the cracks last week when
[10:12.800 --> 10:18.120]  he sent it to us, I guess five days ago. And because if we don't put some spotlight on
[10:18.120 --> 10:22.800]  Greg, there's a good chance they're going to kill him. And I'm not trying to be melodramatic
[10:22.800 --> 10:35.880]  here, ladies and gentlemen. Just Google made dead at Bush's home and you will find dead
[10:35.880 --> 10:43.320]  maids in Kennebunkport, dead maids in Houston, dead maids in Virginia, dead maids everywhere.
[10:43.320 --> 10:47.400]  I mean they run them over in the parking lots, they kill them, they shoot them, whoever's
[10:47.400 --> 10:53.800]  doing this. I mean, but the maid makes them mad. They end up dead in the doornail. There
[10:53.800 --> 11:01.680]  was a woman said that George W. Bush had raped her and the word is in Texas he was incredibly
[11:01.680 --> 11:08.480]  wild back in his younger years and she committed suicide a week later and she said, I'm getting
[11:08.480 --> 11:13.720]  threats and, you know, he raped me and she was dead. And then you have the guy that wrote
[11:13.720 --> 11:20.080]  Fortune and Son right there in the campaign about the alcohol, the drug abuse, things
[11:20.080 --> 11:27.160]  that are on record, but back then it was not known and man, he slid his wrist in that bathtub
[11:27.160 --> 11:37.240]  in Arkansas. So I'm not trying to scare Greg. It doesn't matter whether Greg believes he's
[11:37.240 --> 11:42.560]  in danger or not. I know he is because I saw the look on George Herbert Walker Bush's
[11:42.560 --> 11:48.080]  face, former director of the CIA, a man who carried out the eugenics operations on Native
[11:48.080 --> 11:53.960]  Americans in the 70s sterilizing over 40% of them. The man who got the one child policy
[11:53.960 --> 11:59.760]  put into place in China, the man who put the sanctions in and launched the war that killed
[11:59.760 --> 12:07.040]  over a million Iraqis, the man who went after his business partner Manuel Noriega and just
[12:07.040 --> 12:14.920]  blew several of those cities, Panama city, namely into ashes with the C 130 puff the
[12:14.920 --> 12:20.560]  magic dragon gunships just indiscriminately blasting white phosphorus weapons were used
[12:20.560 --> 12:27.160]  particle beams were tested. They've now declassified that just literally storm troopers just blasting
[12:27.160 --> 12:36.240]  everything in sight. This guy is unbelievably evil, skull and bones, top Luciferian, Bohemian
[12:36.240 --> 12:43.080]  Grove. You know, it's one thing to have courage and certainly Greg has that we're going to
[12:43.080 --> 12:49.680]  Greg at a moment, but it's another thing to actually go jump off a cliff. And I understand
[12:49.680 --> 12:56.600]  his spontaneous anger and indignant outrage at facing a true war criminal. Greg has amazing
[12:56.600 --> 13:02.600]  courage. And it's because he had the courage and it's because at first he scares Bush and
[13:02.600 --> 13:07.560]  Bush starts basically jogging away and then turns once Secret Service get around Greg
[13:07.560 --> 13:16.680]  and Greg's already leaving and start and gives you a very menacing demonic smile. And I'll
[13:16.680 --> 13:23.520]  never forget Barbara Bush had to be 2002 on Larry King live. We wrote an article on it
[13:23.520 --> 13:30.000]  that info wars.com and in link to a video of it, the video since gone dead on whatever
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.040]  video service it was. But the point is sure somebody can find it. It was a Barbara Bush
[13:35.040 --> 13:39.880]  former first lady on Larry King live. And he said, what do you think about your family
[13:39.880 --> 13:43.120]  being in the news? What do you think about, you know, is that fair for the tabloids to
[13:43.120 --> 13:48.040]  cover the, you know, your granddaughters? He didn't mention falling down drunk in Austin
[13:48.040 --> 13:55.640]  or demanding Margaritas when they're 19 years old at Chewie's Mexican food restaurant. By
[13:55.640 --> 13:59.240]  the way, they then persecuted Chewie's, even though Chewie's had nothing to do with it.
[13:59.240 --> 14:03.560]  It was the waitress. And I have to know the whole inside scoop on that. I happen to know
[14:03.560 --> 14:07.800]  that some of the owners of Chewie's, but I'll just, I'll just leave it at that. The point
[14:07.800 --> 14:11.480]  is I've talked to some of the other waiters and managers, people that work there. I've
[14:11.480 --> 14:16.600]  seen the persecution from all sides with that. One time I was with Kevin Booth at his wife's
[14:16.600 --> 14:24.560]  birthday party at city grill steakhouse. And by then I think, yeah, the twins had turned
[14:24.560 --> 14:30.720]  21 and I come walking in and we're going to you, Greg. I just want to finish this story.
[14:30.720 --> 14:37.680]  We come walking in and I see federal marshals at the door and they said, Hey Alex, I'm a
[14:37.680 --> 14:41.680]  fan of your show. I was listening today and they had been listening. He told me about
[14:41.680 --> 14:49.600]  the show and I said, what do you hear for it? He said, I can't tell you. You'll probably
[14:49.600 --> 14:53.680]  notice. You'll probably understand. Well, guess what? Out of the big restaurant, they
[14:53.680 --> 15:01.040]  set us right next to the Bush twins, the daughters, dubious girls and with these two heavy metal
[15:01.040 --> 15:08.600]  guys they were with. And they were drinking quite a bit and Kevin Booth goes, I'm going
[15:08.600 --> 15:12.720]  to my car to get my video camera and I grabbed him by the arm. I said, don't do it. And he
[15:12.720 --> 15:18.160]  kept, he kept getting up to go. And I said, I said, Kevin, these people just launched
[15:18.160 --> 15:27.040]  anthrax attacks on American media because they took photos of them drunk in Austin.
[15:27.040 --> 15:31.320]  You see, I'm, I'm willing to have the globalists come kill me. I'm willing to have them set
[15:31.320 --> 15:38.640]  me up, you know, to be able to tell the truth. But, but I don't, I also understand this code.
[15:38.640 --> 15:45.040]  I don't mess with people's families. I don't want my families messed with, but remember
[15:45.040 --> 15:48.080]  Barbara Bush on Larry King live. He said, what do you think of the daughters? What do
[15:48.080 --> 15:51.680]  you think of them being the news? And she said, if you talk about my family or mess
[15:51.680 --> 15:56.040]  with my family, I will kill you. And Larry King said, you're joking. And she got all
[15:56.040 --> 16:00.240]  a weird face and look completely insane. She said, no, we will kill you. See, they're
[16:00.240 --> 16:06.120]  so corrupt. They're so evil. They can talk about how they'll kill people on television
[16:06.120 --> 16:09.960]  and how they'll kill anybody that messes with their family. Now they may not set you up
[16:09.960 --> 16:14.960]  or may not whack you, Greg, because you did confront one of the men, but you did shake
[16:14.960 --> 16:19.480]  him up a little bit and you've had the secret service visit you repeatedly now. And coming
[16:19.480 --> 16:23.080]  up in the next segment, I'm going to play, this is all up on your YouTube channel. You
[16:23.080 --> 16:26.080]  recorded them at the door. You told them you were recording them when they called you on
[16:26.080 --> 16:31.680]  the phone. So good that you did that. So it's on record and legal to do. But Greg, I tell
[16:31.680 --> 16:37.920]  you, again, I've got you here to put spotlight on you, show that hopefully you don't have
[16:37.920 --> 16:42.040]  an accident. You might want to tell folks you're not planning on committing suicide. Correct?
[16:42.040 --> 16:46.320]  That is correct. Okay, Greg, tell the story of what happened.
[16:46.320 --> 16:51.920]  Basically, I'd gone to lunch last Wednesday with two of my friends and, you know, people
[16:51.920 --> 16:55.520]  are seeing in the video, the first couple of items on the menu are the president and
[16:55.520 --> 17:00.440]  Barbara Bush pizzas. So that's a little sickening to see. And then the whole shrine on the back
[17:00.440 --> 17:07.800]  wall is this and so many restaurants around Houston when the bushes frequent a place. So
[17:07.800 --> 17:12.680]  at the end of my meal, well, I guess halfway through the meal, the secret service agent,
[17:12.680 --> 17:16.760]  one of them came into the establishment and was scoping it out. It was very obvious what
[17:16.760 --> 17:21.160]  was going on. I told my friends that, Hey, obviously, Bobby Bush is going to be coming
[17:21.160 --> 17:25.760]  in here in a moment. Sure enough, you know, several minutes later, the rest of them pull
[17:25.760 --> 17:31.000]  off. We were pretty much done eating. I walk out to my car to get my camera. I come back
[17:31.000 --> 17:35.240]  in and actually I was right next to him at one point. I mean, I had to stand directly
[17:35.240 --> 17:41.320]  behind him as he was in the doorway. I guess probably shaking somebody's hand there, whatnot.
[17:41.320 --> 17:45.480]  And I actually waited for him to get a good ways away from me in the restaurant with him
[17:45.480 --> 17:49.400]  alone. Barbara wasn't there. There were no females. There were no children in the place
[17:49.400 --> 17:54.560]  that was rather empty at that point. It was a late lunch. And when he got a good distance
[17:54.560 --> 18:00.000]  away, I started recording and that's when you hear the profanities that just came out.
[18:00.000 --> 18:04.240]  It wasn't planned like that by any means and the entire time I was doing that, I was making
[18:04.240 --> 18:08.720]  my way towards the door. So I waited for him to get away. I worked, you know, my way towards
[18:08.720 --> 18:15.040]  the door and all the way out the door. Um, and but you also forcefully did, did tell
[18:15.040 --> 18:20.640]  say he was a mass murder for Iraq and other wars. Yeah, I called him a Zionist, murderous.
[18:20.640 --> 18:28.560]  Yeah. And then the expletives. Um, why Zionist? I mean, I know Israel supported those wars,
[18:28.560 --> 18:33.160]  but if you really study the bushes at Scullin Bones and his grand, his father Prescott,
[18:33.160 --> 18:38.640]  uh, that they're also Nazis. But I mean, I, I mean, I guess he does support Israel. So
[18:38.640 --> 18:42.560]  he is a Zionist. Well, I wish I could have articulated a little bit better. I'm recently
[18:42.560 --> 18:47.120]  learning a lot more about this. You know, I woke up to nine 11 at the end of oh five.
[18:47.120 --> 18:51.000]  And at this point, my research and from what I see through all these facts that seems to
[18:51.000 --> 18:55.920]  me that it is the Israel Mossad and these Zionists that are pretty much behind most
[18:55.920 --> 19:01.200]  every single event that was through the Rothschild that started World War One, World War Two.
[19:01.200 --> 19:05.520]  The war is going on now. You know, they made Switzerland a neutral place so that they could
[19:05.520 --> 19:11.000]  fund it for both sides. Uh, I mean, the list goes on. They're the ones behind the first
[19:11.000 --> 19:15.400]  bank of this nation, the second bank, now the Federal Reserve. I see their hands tied
[19:15.400 --> 19:19.400]  to everything. So I know that you mentioned things like the CFR and Goldberg, all this,
[19:19.400 --> 19:23.760]  but when I actually looked at the top of these things that he's pulling those strings, that
[19:23.760 --> 19:32.120]  there is, I do now see the head of the beat and I see it is Zionist. So that's why I see
[19:32.120 --> 19:33.120]  that he is.
[19:33.120 --> 19:37.480]  Okay. Well, now we understand why stay there. Let's come back and play some audio, the videos
[19:37.480 --> 19:43.080]  up on your YouTube channels. We've got links to it up on infowars.com and prosimplanet.com,
[19:43.080 --> 19:48.200]  but it's youtube.com forward slash user forward slash live music where you can see all the
[19:48.200 --> 19:53.160]  videos in detail. We're going to come back play part of the confrontation with the Secret
[19:53.160 --> 19:57.840]  Service when they came to your house and then we'll get into, uh, you're not wanting to
[19:57.840 --> 20:01.320]  commit suicide. I think it's important to get that on record.

[22:01.880 --> 22:06.400]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[22:06.400 --> 22:11.880]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug
[22:11.880 --> 22:16.880]  from underneath the Americans at home. I have turned a tremendous influence on our president
[22:16.880 --> 22:21.920]  in Congress, and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of
[22:21.920 --> 22:27.440]  us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies
[22:27.440 --> 22:33.000]  of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[22:33.000 --> 22:37.640]  its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're
[22:37.640 --> 22:41.800]  asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[22:41.800 --> 22:47.640]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[22:47.640 --> 22:53.920]  of the Republic. Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're
[22:53.920 --> 23:00.240]  watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[23:00.240 --> 23:04.400]  Listen carefully to this message. If you're about to buy hardwood flooring, you're going
[23:04.400 --> 23:09.000]  to pay too much. Unless, of course, you buy from us. We're lumber liquidators, and no
[23:09.000 --> 23:13.200]  one, including those big box stores, can sell wood flooring for less. When you buy your
[23:13.200 --> 23:18.360]  quality hardwood flooring from lumber liquidators, you save hundreds, if not thousands, every
[23:18.360 --> 23:23.520]  time because we buy direct from the mills. We are truly the wood floor experts. To prove
[23:23.520 --> 23:30.400]  it, we'll send you our beautiful full-colored catalog absolutely free. Call 1-800-580-7310.
[23:30.400 --> 23:35.160]  It's filled with top-quality hardwood flooring for less. Solid hardwoods in cherry, oak and
[23:35.160 --> 23:39.920]  walnut, bamboo, laminates, and even bellowwood pre-finished flooring with a 50-year warranty.
[23:39.920 --> 23:43.800]  The same floor Bob Vila has in his home. Don't pay more than you have to for flooring.
[23:43.800 --> 23:48.440]  Call lumber liquidators now. We even offer installation and financing. Visit your local
[23:48.440 --> 23:57.000]  lumber liquidators or call now for your free catalog 1-800-580-7310. That's 1-800-580-7310.
[23:57.000 --> 24:09.040]  There has been a gigantic development on the naked body scanner front. It's far worse
[24:09.040 --> 24:14.640]  than I even thought. That's coming up in the next segment. Then Tyrell Ventura, son of
[24:14.640 --> 24:21.440]  Jesse Ventura, one of the producers, cameraman, researchers on the TV show. My idea to get
[24:21.440 --> 24:25.720]  him on because he's just a really great guy, very informed. He can give us some inside
[24:25.720 --> 24:30.560]  scoops on whether his dad's going to be running for president in 2012. We'll be discussing
[24:30.560 --> 24:31.560]  that.
[24:31.560 --> 24:35.760]  Then, of course, a member of the Icelandic Parliament about the banking takeover there
[24:35.760 --> 24:41.720]  and the people fighting back. This is a precedent-setting case. Then we also have Catherine Austin
[24:41.720 --> 24:48.440]  Fitz on Bankstergate coming up today. Regardless of what you think of Greg, it is his free
[24:48.440 --> 24:58.840]  speech right to yell at the former president. I wouldn't have used profanity, but regardless,
[24:58.840 --> 25:07.160]  I commend his courage. You can only marvel at it. Greg, you sound like you're informed
[25:07.160 --> 25:14.400]  on things. You understood how incredibly dangerous this person is. He's probably the most dangerous
[25:14.400 --> 25:17.000]  person to confront that I could think of.
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.960]  I do realize that, and I did realize that, but it's a moment that just kind of leaves
[25:21.960 --> 25:28.000]  your head. You know, when you just get that sense, that feeling, well, when he walks in,
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.400]  it was overwhelming. That's what came out.
[25:32.400 --> 25:37.760]  There is a tide in the affairs of men when taken at the flood leads on to fortune. I
[25:37.760 --> 25:44.360]  guess the fortune you're looking for is liberty and freedom in your time. The Bushes are a
[25:44.360 --> 25:49.400]  very complex family, and the power structure they belong to is very, very complex. But
[25:49.400 --> 25:52.960]  just to be on record here, you're not planning to commit suicide.
[25:52.960 --> 25:56.800]  I'm not planning to commit suicide. I would not be an activist. I would not do that stuff.
[25:56.800 --> 26:01.560]  I didn't see all of the beauty in life worth being here for, and I don't see how that viewpoint
[26:01.560 --> 26:03.720]  will ever change my mind.
[26:03.720 --> 26:04.960]  So you will never commit suicide?
[26:04.960 --> 26:10.440]  I will never commit suicide. Not a chance. But before I forget, I do want to tell people
[26:10.440 --> 26:14.400]  that they are in the Houston area. We have HoustonTruth.org. We've got some great activists
[26:14.400 --> 26:19.040]  and if there weren't for some of my, some of the core group of some of the trusted individuals
[26:19.040 --> 26:21.160]  yesterday would have been a lot tougher to stomach.
[26:21.160 --> 26:26.680]  Well, I got to DC Madam to say on air that she would never commit suicide. She told her
[26:26.680 --> 26:30.960]  landlord she was being followed, and they certainly killed her. Then they had a government
[26:30.960 --> 26:35.000]  minion come out and say, oh, she told me she was thinking about it. So, you know, even
[26:35.000 --> 26:38.400]  though you're on record saying you won't commit suicide, they'll, they'll have somebody pop
[26:38.400 --> 26:42.640]  up and they kill you and say, oh, yes, Greg said he was going to commit suicide. So if
[26:42.640 --> 26:48.480]  anybody says that they're a liar, they will definitely be a liar, not a friend of mine.
[26:48.480 --> 26:55.000]  Okay. I want to play a clip. Again, the video is up on the web, but here's an audio clip
[26:55.000 --> 26:57.200]  of the Secret Service at your front door. Here it is.
[26:57.200 --> 26:58.200]  Protection.
[26:58.200 --> 27:01.560]  Yeah, I apologize, sir, but we won't be able to talk with you if you're going to use the
[27:01.560 --> 27:04.640]  camera. And I understand if you won't use it, but I wouldn't be able to talk with you,
[27:04.640 --> 27:06.280]  sir. And I just needed a few minutes.
[27:06.280 --> 27:08.400]  You can have my time right now. So I'm happy to give it to you.
[27:08.400 --> 27:11.760]  I just can't do so under those circumstances, sir. I'm sorry for the interruption.
[27:11.760 --> 27:15.080]  I understand that. Thank you guys. I appreciate it. And let me let you know, please, because
[27:15.080 --> 27:19.360]  I understand obviously what this is about. I am no threat to the man. That's why I walked
[27:19.360 --> 27:23.400]  off and also appreciate the way I understand. I also want to let you know that I appreciate
[27:23.400 --> 27:28.000]  the way the Secret Service handed the handle handled it the other day. Because I know the
[27:28.000 --> 27:32.160]  police officer might handle it differently. I really do respect that treatment. And I
[27:32.160 --> 27:34.520]  do appreciate you coming by. I mean, as far as that, but
[27:34.520 --> 27:35.520]  Certainly.
[27:35.520 --> 27:38.200]  If you change your mind and you wish to talk with us, do you have a card that you can leave
[27:38.200 --> 27:39.200]  on my door?
[27:39.200 --> 27:42.960]  But if you'll call the Secret Service, the Houston telephone number and let us know,
[27:42.960 --> 27:44.280]  we'll meet somewhere and we can talk.
[27:44.280 --> 27:48.400]  Is there, do I call? What do I, what do I Google? Like, what do I search?
[27:48.400 --> 27:51.400]  The telephone number to the Secret Service is 713-868-2299.
[27:51.400 --> 27:52.400]  Okay.
[27:52.400 --> 27:55.160]  You can just call until you need to speak with someone in protection.
[27:55.160 --> 27:56.160]  Okay. Thank you, sir.
[27:56.160 --> 27:57.160]  Have a great day.
[27:57.160 --> 28:00.560]  That's the good cop one. Smiley one. That looked like a really dangerous one, the one that
[28:00.560 --> 28:05.120]  wasn't talking, who popped into view for a minute. Looked very predatory, Greg.
[28:05.120 --> 28:09.280]  The other one actually had quite a different look on his face when I first opened the door.
[28:09.280 --> 28:11.800]  The camera kind of changed that a little bit.
[28:11.800 --> 28:16.920]  Yeah. Well, one of them was looking at you like he was on a rabbit hunt. And so, and
[28:16.920 --> 28:20.520]  there's also the nine minute recording you did of them on the phone when they called
[28:20.520 --> 28:23.720]  you and you let them know you were recording that.
[28:23.720 --> 28:28.440]  So well, all I can say is you're going to see more of this. You're going to see more
[28:28.440 --> 28:32.760]  elitist being confronted by the people. That's why they want this cashless society control
[28:32.760 --> 28:39.840]  grid, this RFID face scanning grid so that everybody on a list, tens of millions of Americans,
[28:39.840 --> 28:43.840]  the establishment can just pull up a computer screen and see where everybody is in live
[28:43.840 --> 28:49.400]  time where their last known face scan was made or where your cell phone being tracked
[28:49.400 --> 28:53.840]  under federal law, everyone's cell phone attached to your social security number is.
[28:53.840 --> 28:58.720]  And so that's why they want this whole system is so they can get away with all their activities.
[28:58.720 --> 29:00.960]  But anything else you'd like to add?
[29:00.960 --> 29:05.200]  Well, first of all, can I remind people to please has nothing to do with me trying to
[29:05.200 --> 29:10.440]  get a bigger name for myself, but you this stuff on the live music YouTube channel that
[29:10.440 --> 29:15.120]  you had mentioned because, you know, like you said, safety in numbers. That's one reason
[29:15.120 --> 29:20.920]  like that's great to get my message out here on your show with your huge audience. But with
[29:20.920 --> 29:25.480]  all these people ripping off the video, you know, if I had stood up for some of that,
[29:25.480 --> 29:29.680]  you know, people may not even know who I was if I disappeared.
[29:29.680 --> 29:34.200]  But anyway, no, like I said, HoustonTruth.org, if you want to get active in Houston.
[29:34.200 --> 29:38.880]  All right, well, Greg, thank you for contacting us last week when this first happened. Sorry,
[29:38.880 --> 29:42.560]  we didn't make the connection. We just get bombarded with information. I'll talk to you

[33:10.600 --> 33:18.160]  During the break, Greg, who confronted George H. W. Bush, the 41st president in a Houston
[33:18.160 --> 33:24.640]  pizza place, he clarified a lot. The Secret Service visited him yesterday at his home
[33:24.640 --> 33:29.240]  and called him and still want him to come meet with them somewhere. He didn't want to
[33:29.240 --> 33:34.160]  go outside the door where they could just snatch him. When you're dealing with Bush,
[33:34.160 --> 33:43.840]  you never know. They could do anything. They came to visit him after the video went up
[33:43.840 --> 33:52.240]  on Brett Bart and on Drudge Report and other places. So, see, it's politically motivated.
[33:52.240 --> 33:58.840]  This was just going to be, I guess, ignored until the fact that he publicly put it out
[33:58.840 --> 34:04.840]  there because, see, the mafia can't let some little slave stand up against them and speak
[34:04.840 --> 34:11.800]  out against them. They can't allow that because then this whole system is held together by
[34:11.800 --> 34:22.200]  fear. This whole system is strung together and is integrated by fear, by people saying,
[34:22.200 --> 34:25.600]  oh, I'm in a free country, but you better not criticize the government. You'll get on
[34:25.600 --> 34:31.560]  a list. Oh, I live in a free country, but I'm not going to speak out because that's dangerous.
[34:31.560 --> 34:35.400]  Almost anybody you talk to will say that, but you're in a free country, though, but
[34:35.400 --> 34:41.880]  you better not speak out in your free country. And I will remind you that I confronted in
[34:41.880 --> 34:50.280]  a peaceable, polite manner, George W. Bush when he was governor at a press conference
[34:50.280 --> 34:57.200]  right before he ran for president. And I asked a question. You want to watch it. It's on
[34:57.200 --> 35:01.680]  YouTube. It's everywhere. Just Alex Jones arrested for asking George Bush a question
[35:01.680 --> 35:09.120]  in the name of the video. And all I did was say, sir, isn't what's hurting Texas in America,
[35:09.120 --> 35:12.720]  the council and farm relations, the offshore banks, the European Union that want to take
[35:12.720 --> 35:17.720]  over our country, which you now see as mainstream news that's happening through Copenhagen and
[35:17.720 --> 35:25.600]  other events, other instruments. And he just looked at the state police and they just came
[35:25.600 --> 35:30.800]  over, grabbed me, almost broke my arm, put my fist behind my back all the way up to my
[35:30.800 --> 35:35.840]  neck. I still have pain. You know, when you roll over in bed and you've got a torn shoulder,
[35:35.840 --> 35:40.480]  I've never got it worked on or gone to the doctor. When I lift weights, it hurts when
[35:40.480 --> 35:45.880]  I jog it hurts when I roll over in bed. It's incredibly painful. I mean, they hurt me,
[35:45.880 --> 35:50.960]  hurt me bad. And, you know, I didn't assume or mess with that. I don't have time. I mean,
[35:50.960 --> 35:54.400]  it goes with the territory, but I didn't know they were going to rough me up. I didn't know
[35:54.400 --> 35:59.320]  they were going to twist my arm behind my back for five minutes. You know, they say,
[35:59.320 --> 36:05.120]  trap his arms behind his back, trap him over here on the wall, didn't resist nothing. And
[36:05.120 --> 36:10.200]  that was for simply asking him a question saying, sir, don't you care about America?
[36:10.200 --> 36:13.760]  Don't you want to stop the globalist, the New World Order, the Council on Foreign Relations?
[36:13.760 --> 36:21.400]  This country's been taken over by Europe. And they had me by then. And I was there for
[36:21.400 --> 36:31.640]  radio station for talk station, FM talk 98 nine at the time. And there I was simply asking
[36:31.640 --> 36:39.400]  a question. So if they did that to me, can you and kidnapped me, they drove me around
[36:39.400 --> 36:43.440]  for an hour and they said, we're going to charge you with this and that. And then they
[36:43.440 --> 36:48.800]  came over the radio and said, go to cell phone. And the constable that had me went to cell
[36:48.800 --> 36:57.360]  phone as I was in the back of the police car driving around, around rock. And he says,
[36:57.360 --> 37:06.040]  the governor says releasing the governor says releasing. Okay. Okay. Oh, but don't drop
[37:06.040 --> 37:10.880]  him off in Austin, but not yet, not until the governor's gone. Okay, I'll drive him
[37:10.880 --> 37:17.280]  around for an hour hangs up and he goes, well, the governor says, release you, but not yet.
[37:17.280 --> 37:21.120]  And I said, sir, I waited for that three or four speeches over an hour and a half. I need
[37:21.120 --> 37:28.360]  to urinate. And he said, well, when I get you to Austin, you can do that. And then I said,
[37:28.360 --> 37:34.760]  look, you can't do this. I heard him say release me. This is kidnapping. And so he takes me
[37:34.760 --> 37:43.480]  in handcuffs into an H E B so I can go to the bathroom. And I tell you, that was a trick
[37:43.480 --> 37:49.200]  getting my pants down. And then he takes me puts me in the car, takes the handcuffs off,
[37:49.200 --> 37:52.200]  but says, you must get in the car. And I wasn't going to resist him, even though this was
[37:52.200 --> 37:57.280]  totally unlawful. It's ridiculous. After he saw a stupid, it wasn't me in the bathroom.
[37:57.280 --> 38:01.760]  You know, that, you know, so the handcuffs get taken off after that little shenanigan.
[38:01.760 --> 38:05.540]  And then he drives me around for another 20 minutes, drives me to North Austin and drops
[38:05.540 --> 38:12.640]  me off in front of an office building. And says, this is where my jurisdiction ends.
[38:12.640 --> 38:16.720]  And then he was acting scared. He rolled in the window and he goes, sorry, sorry, you
[38:16.720 --> 38:21.200]  know, 45 minutes before they were almost twisted my arm off my body. That was actually the state
[38:21.200 --> 38:27.600]  police playing close state police. But the, the, you know, the constables were jumping
[38:27.600 --> 38:33.080]  all over me while it was happening. It's just ridiculous in America. These guys have the
[38:33.080 --> 38:40.960]  bill of rights and constitution so asked backwards is the only word they have. It's so backwards
[38:40.960 --> 38:44.720]  that they really thought this was normal. They were really going to set me up and frame
[38:44.720 --> 38:50.520]  me and charge me with trespassing and with a whole bunch of other crimes. They were sitting
[38:50.520 --> 38:53.600]  there, you know, while they had me in the police car going over together, yeah, we'll
[38:53.600 --> 38:56.920]  charge him with this and we'll, we'll charge him with that. And you can hear him on the
[38:56.920 --> 39:02.400]  video because I had a wireless mic in my hand that was then on the ground while they're
[39:02.400 --> 39:05.120]  talking about it. What are we going to charge him with? We'll charge him with this. Well,
[39:05.120 --> 39:08.720]  we'll charge him with that. We'll charge him with, I mean, they just relished having
[39:08.720 --> 39:13.840]  an innocent man hurting my shoulder because I'm not a human being. See with psychopaths
[39:13.840 --> 39:18.240]  and these cops weren't all actual psychopaths, but they're in a psychopathic culture where
[39:18.240 --> 39:24.480]  I'm dehumanized. I don't matter. You know, if I would have twisted a cop's shoulder partway
[39:24.480 --> 39:32.240]  out of joint, it would have been assault on an officer 10 years in the pen. But you grab
[39:32.240 --> 39:40.560]  some reporter who doesn't resist you and almost twist their arm off their body. And I guess
[39:40.560 --> 39:46.160]  at the time I was too macho to say, Hey, you're hurting me too. It was burning and throbbing
[39:46.160 --> 39:50.640]  and they were pushing it and shoving it up as hard as they could. Same thing happened
[39:50.640 --> 39:55.000]  in New York when I got arrested. They lifted my arms way up behind my back, slammed the
[39:55.000 --> 40:00.240]  cuffs on where my arms were physically too high and I couldn't breathe. It was, I've
[40:00.240 --> 40:06.720]  got wide shoulders. I'm ranting. Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize.
[40:06.720 --> 40:12.200]  The point is, is that I don't even hate those officers. I feel sorry for them. I mean, they
[40:12.200 --> 40:18.800]  are so screwed up that they think setting an American citizen up a reporter who doesn't
[40:18.800 --> 40:24.240]  resist them. They were ready to charge me. They were ready. The round rock is so corrupt.
[40:24.240 --> 40:28.000]  Williamson County is so corrupt. One of the most corrupt in the nation. It's been rated
[40:28.000 --> 40:33.560]  as that. They would just love it. I'm not a human being. I don't have value. I don't
[40:33.560 --> 40:40.360]  have rights, but the governor, the God, and that's how it works in psychopathic cultures.
[40:40.360 --> 40:47.080]  The big man said release him. So they did, but not before I got driven around for another
[40:47.080 --> 40:52.840]  30 minutes. All right. Now listen, there has been a development with body scanners that
[40:52.840 --> 41:03.800]  really freaked me out. And I've always said that I'm 95% wrong on the information we present.
[41:03.800 --> 41:12.080]  But there's a twist to that 95% of the time it's worse than I say over 90%. It's always
[41:12.080 --> 41:21.160]  worse than I say. It's always worse. And it's so much more horrible than I even knew. Ladies
[41:21.160 --> 41:25.920]  and gentlemen, I'm going to cover this in about six minutes, but I want right now to
[41:25.920 --> 41:31.000]  go to a guest who I like to get on once a month, Lisa Pelton, regional director of sales
[41:31.000 --> 41:37.160]  for the wonderful Acola Blue Company. I contacted them to be a sponsor. Normally we get contacted
[41:37.160 --> 41:40.680]  by people that want to be sponsors and we turn down majority of them because I have
[41:40.680 --> 41:45.120]  to believe in the product. I tested out different atmospheric systems. I knew Williamson was
[41:45.120 --> 41:51.280]  into them and his system's fine. But I found this was the best cost, highest quality, best
[41:51.280 --> 41:56.360]  filtration. It is the Acola Blue 28 and Acola Blue 30. They have a whole bunch of other
[41:56.360 --> 42:01.480]  great systems. And I wanted to get Lisa Pelton on for five minutes to tell folks about another
[42:01.480 --> 42:06.720]  special they're doing. They do this every few months and they've got a new super special
[42:06.720 --> 42:10.120]  that she's going to tell you about today with these atmospheric water generators. You can't
[42:10.120 --> 42:17.080]  get better water, period. Lisa, thanks for coming on with us. Hi, Alex. I have to again
[42:17.080 --> 42:21.520]  compliment you for being able to get me all fired up. You know, you're the one who taught
[42:21.520 --> 42:28.120]  me to speak out and that's why I work for Acola Blue. So one thing I have to tell you
[42:28.120 --> 42:36.520]  how much I appreciate seeing you on conspiracy theory. You're getting the message out. People
[42:36.520 --> 42:41.320]  are calling me and saying, oh my God, it makes sense now. So just wanted to compliment you.
[42:41.320 --> 42:47.440]  Well, thank you. I mean, I'm amazed by how good that show is. It's the 2012 show tonight.
[42:47.440 --> 42:52.520]  And again, it's the most in depth report on 2012 you'll ever see. Yeah, I mean, it's
[42:52.520 --> 42:58.680]  just it's brilliant. And you just mentioned that you have a unit so you know what it provides
[42:58.680 --> 43:03.520]  you and your family to have an Acola Blue. It gets you off the grid. It gives you a little
[43:03.520 --> 43:09.080]  bit of peace of mind knowing that that's one last thing you have to worry about. We have
[43:09.080 --> 43:16.440]  the new Acola Blue 30 that produces up to eight gallons a day. It has a 12 stage filtration
[43:16.440 --> 43:20.600]  process. And when they deliver it to your door, all you do is plug it in because it
[43:20.600 --> 43:29.320]  comes complete with filters. It's pure water from the air. You don't need a water source.
[43:29.320 --> 43:36.920]  The new unit has a wonderful energy consumption rate. It's just absolutely fundamental to
[43:36.920 --> 43:43.520]  have this for your health of not only you, but you and your family. And the water quality
[43:43.520 --> 43:48.200]  at the highest level has been confirmed by seven independent labs. That's all at acolablu.com
[43:48.200 --> 43:54.800]  generates water from as low as 35% humidity produces up to eight gallons of water within
[43:54.800 --> 44:00.720]  24 hours. That's the new Acola Blue 30. The Acola Blue 28 does seven, seven and a half.
[44:00.720 --> 44:07.040]  It has seven filters. This one has 12 filters in it. I mean, this is getting to a ridiculous
[44:07.040 --> 44:10.800]  level of filtration. I mean, I have to say ridiculous, but it really is.
[44:10.800 --> 44:18.480]  Well, you know, we have to be concerned about the quality of water. And so it requires additional
[44:18.480 --> 44:24.520]  filtration every time we find out that they're going to put something new in the water or
[44:24.520 --> 44:28.280]  put something in the water. Absolutely. When I say ridiculous, I mean, it's just 12 filters.
[44:28.280 --> 44:32.480]  That's what's needed to get the ridiculous amount of garbage and junk and different things
[44:32.480 --> 44:37.920]  and it takes different types of filters. And it's reverse osmosis, carbon, UV light, stainless
[44:37.920 --> 44:47.640]  steel container, all these different filtration systems, acolablu.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[44:47.640 --> 44:52.240]  And you guys have got another special running. Tell folks about that, Lisa. Well, on our
[44:52.240 --> 45:00.120]  news, acolablu30, if anyone hits the website or calls the number and mentions Alice Jones
[45:00.120 --> 45:07.240]  or uses it as a promo code, they're going to get a complete two-year filtration with
[45:07.240 --> 45:13.760]  their unit. So it's actually $150 value. So you don't have to worry about your filters
[45:13.760 --> 45:14.760]  for two years.
[45:14.760 --> 45:18.400]  So you get another year supply because you got to replace the filters once a year.
[45:18.400 --> 45:25.520]  Now, I'm sorry, a year and a half. So basically you have two full years of filtration. You
[45:25.520 --> 45:26.920]  don't have to worry about it.
[45:26.920 --> 45:31.880]  Okay. So you're giving them an extra set of replacement filters?
[45:31.880 --> 45:38.640]  For 18 months. 18 months worth of filtration. Plus, your unit comes with filters. So basically
[45:38.640 --> 45:41.320]  you're getting two years of filters.
[45:41.320 --> 45:45.600]  Amazing. Or it sounds like more. It already comes with filters that are good for 18 months
[45:45.600 --> 45:51.680]  and another set. That's incredible. And so you're getting those free, just tacked on.
[45:51.680 --> 45:57.960]  Just tacked on because it's for your listeners, Alex. So they use the promo code, Alex Jones.
[45:57.960 --> 46:09.600]  Either go to the website, acolablu.com, that's E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com, or call 1-800-691-6043.
[46:09.600 --> 46:14.880]  Absolutely. And again, every month and a half, two months, you guys do a special for four
[46:14.880 --> 46:18.840]  or five days. It normally runs from Wednesday to Monday. Is that how long this is running
[46:18.840 --> 46:19.840]  again?
[46:19.840 --> 46:23.840]  This is running through the 17th of January.
[46:23.840 --> 46:30.920]  Oh, good. So this runs until, I guess, what day is that? Is that next Monday or Tuesday?
[46:30.920 --> 46:34.120]  That's a Sunday. Yeah. Through Sunday to 17th.
[46:34.120 --> 46:38.600]  Okay. So it's running through Sunday. And again, give people that number so they can
[46:38.600 --> 46:39.600]  call.
[46:39.600 --> 46:47.040]  So it's 1-800, or I'm sorry, forgive me, 1-800-691-6043.
[46:47.040 --> 46:48.040]  One more time.
[46:48.040 --> 46:56.120]  1-800-691-6043. And there's one more thing I have to ask you, Alex, ask you and your
[46:56.120 --> 46:57.120]  listeners.
[46:57.120 --> 46:59.120]  Sure.
[46:59.120 --> 47:06.920]  We know about the devastation in Haiti. And acolablu has a 200-liter industrial unit sitting
[47:06.920 --> 47:12.040]  in the warehouse. And we'd be happy to send it to Haiti if we could have somebody help
[47:12.040 --> 47:16.080]  us facilitate getting it there. We're just not in the business of...
[47:16.080 --> 47:20.920]  Well, that's the problem. Major corporations, the National Guard, the Coast Guard tried
[47:20.920 --> 47:25.400]  to help people. Walmart tried to help. One of the few good things, I guess they do, with
[47:25.400 --> 47:28.240]  Katrina and they weren't allowed to help.
[47:28.240 --> 47:34.520]  But you're saying if somebody can deliver this unit or get it to Haiti, you will get
[47:34.520 --> 47:40.200]  it to Haiti and will you send a technician? I mean, it's easy to use, but so when the
[47:40.200 --> 47:42.680]  Haitians get it, they know how to use it?
[47:42.680 --> 47:49.440]  We'll get it there, we'll send it back. It's going to provide at least 200 liters. The thing
[47:49.440 --> 47:56.000]  that we need most in a natural disaster is clean water and acolablu would be happy to
[47:56.000 --> 47:57.000]  help.
[47:57.000 --> 48:01.720]  Okay, so folks, if people want to help, they can also call that number to help you or give
[48:01.720 --> 48:02.720]  you ideas.
[48:02.720 --> 48:09.920]  That's right. 1-800-691-6043. And if they're interested in helping, they can ask for Tracy.
[48:09.920 --> 48:15.120]  Awesome. Ask for Tracy. Well, Lisa, acolablu.com, thank you so much. We'll talk to you again
[48:15.120 --> 48:16.120]  in a month or so.
[48:16.120 --> 48:18.160]  Keep up the good work, Alex.
[48:18.160 --> 48:23.480]  You too, take care. Yeah, seriously, we called up to get them as a sponsor and most of the
[48:23.480 --> 48:29.240]  people that worked there are big fans. So it was an easy sell, I guess a year or so ago.
[48:29.240 --> 48:33.920]  They've been sponsoring us that long, but we love the folks at acolablu, so they join
[48:33.920 --> 48:36.160]  us at least once a month.
[48:36.160 --> 48:41.760]  You know, I don't even want to cover the news I've got. I mean, some days I get in here
[48:41.760 --> 48:56.680]  and it's so humiliating. It's so ridiculous. It's so obvious. It's so stupid. And I go
[48:56.680 --> 49:02.400]  on radio shows. I learned about this yesterday and I was on a radio show and as a guest
[49:02.400 --> 49:09.320]  and I was talking about how amazing it is. And you know, people were saying, well, isn't
[49:09.320 --> 49:15.600]  this just for our safety, the naked body scanners? And we know it can cause cancer and we know
[49:15.600 --> 49:19.880]  that's in mainstream news. Top scientists saying you do this over and over again. It
[49:19.880 --> 49:27.760]  does increase your load of radiation, similar radiation, what you get from x-rays with the
[49:27.760 --> 49:32.520]  naked body scanners.
[49:32.520 --> 49:37.620]  And we know they're really getting a biometric scan of the body so that they can have passive
[49:37.620 --> 49:46.600]  systems that scan you and read your biometric identifiers from a distance. This is all admitted.
[49:46.600 --> 49:50.440]  In the government in Australia, the U.S. and England, they all admit that it is recording
[49:50.440 --> 49:57.320]  your naked body. They are storing the images. And I know that at least three, four years
[49:57.320 --> 50:02.920]  ago I saw articles about mobile body scanner trucks in England and I saw blurbs about our
[50:02.920 --> 50:08.360]  government says they may give them to TSA and FBI and local police for mobile body
[50:08.360 --> 50:22.920]  scanners on the street. But I learned yesterday that over a year and a half ago, major cities
[50:22.920 --> 50:32.720]  and major counties in the United States began purchasing and installing naked body scanners.
[50:32.720 --> 50:39.080]  This, well, I'll tell you what they're using it for when we get back on the other side.
[50:39.080 --> 50:48.720]  I just, this is so outrageous. This is so, this is a whole new level and it blows my
[50:48.720 --> 51:00.800]  mind and it is such a big deal. It is such a huge issue.
[51:00.800 --> 51:05.240]  That related health problems affect millions of people each year. Maybe you're one of
[51:05.240 --> 51:10.080]  the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive
[51:10.080 --> 51:15.560]  heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat or clondardaries. There is a solution
[51:15.560 --> 51:20.160]  that doesn't involve expensive prescription drugs that only mask the problem and leave
[51:20.160 --> 51:24.760]  you with horrible side effects. If you are ready to live your life free of sickness,
[51:24.760 --> 51:30.880]  pain and fear, live your life with increased vitality, energy and youthfulness and experience
[51:30.880 --> 51:35.800]  your body healing itself, then you're ready for heart and body extract from Healthy Hearts

[52:01.920 --> 52:06.440]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[52:06.440 --> 52:12.200]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from
[52:12.200 --> 52:18.200]  underneath Americans at home. I have a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and
[52:18.200 --> 52:23.360]  they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[52:23.360 --> 52:28.520]  citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the
[52:28.520 --> 52:34.640]  criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[52:34.640 --> 52:39.120]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches
[52:39.120 --> 52:42.720]  and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody
[52:42.720 --> 52:48.480]  does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[53:12.720 --> 53:17.000]  Exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these harmful toxins. Did you know that
[53:17.000 --> 53:21.440]  your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?

[53:57.520 --> 54:15.440]  to purify your life today. I spent more than an hour last night in absolute
[54:15.440 --> 54:22.920]  horror that for two plus weeks we've been launching a national campaign and contest
[54:22.920 --> 54:28.680]  and need to codify and post in the next few days at infowars.com the contest rules to expose
[54:28.680 --> 54:33.960]  the naked body scanners and what this agenda really means. It's so big, it's so key to
[54:33.960 --> 54:43.080]  their overall program of dehumanization and training us to be slaves that I could be researching
[54:43.080 --> 54:49.680]  this for years and also researching it intensely in the last two and a half weeks since the
[54:49.680 --> 54:53.960]  underwear bomber and they launched this whole PR campaign for the naked body scanners and
[54:53.960 --> 54:59.640]  record you, your wife, your children's bodies and store it with biometric data that I could
[54:59.640 --> 55:06.520]  miss this. But I was doing a radio interview and the producer said, oh yeah, we hate these
[55:06.520 --> 55:13.840]  naked body scanners. I had to go pay a traffic ticket and for anyone that goes into the county
[55:13.840 --> 55:21.800]  courthouse, everyone is put through the machine and I said, are you sure? And so I googled
[55:21.800 --> 55:28.280]  body scanners go to Denver and then I googled body scanners and courthouses and it's going
[55:28.280 --> 55:38.120]  in all over the country. It's been going in since early 2008. Here's one June 11th, 2008.
[55:38.120 --> 55:44.960]  This is a year and a half ago, the Denver News Channel, the denverchannel.com, ABC News,
[55:44.960 --> 55:55.680]  $250,000 machine takes 3D images and they just admit it, a total 3D image of your body
[55:55.680 --> 56:06.200]  and everyone must do it to go to traffic court. I mean, this is incredible. And so now to
[56:06.200 --> 56:11.600]  go to court and exercise your right to the court system, they are putting naked body
[56:11.600 --> 56:16.920]  scanners in all over the country. I got articles out of Texas, New York, California and then
[56:16.920 --> 56:24.040]  I saw articles in the last few months where they're ordering them at courthouses everywhere.
[56:24.040 --> 56:27.680]  And so it's not enough to have a metal detector. See, first they train you with that, then
[56:27.680 --> 56:32.520]  it's the naked body scanners, then they want shock bracelets to get on planes. Now imagine
[56:32.520 --> 56:37.480]  10 years ago when I warned people about face scanning cameras and biometrics and face scanning
[56:37.480 --> 56:42.520]  to buy and sell, it sounded crazy. It would never happen. And now they're face scanning
[56:42.520 --> 56:46.560]  you to get on planes, body scanning you to get on planes, body scanning you to get into
[56:46.560 --> 56:51.680]  airports. And it sounds crazy to say they're going to put taser bracelets on everyone to
[56:51.680 --> 56:56.600]  get on planes and then to go into courthouses. But Homeland Security says they want to do
[56:56.600 --> 57:02.400]  this and they're looking at doing it. Do you understand that it will just get worse and
[57:02.400 --> 57:09.920]  worse and worse? And then there's a whole nother facet to this. One guy goes in a courthouse
[57:09.920 --> 57:15.000]  and shoots people. We've all got to be naked body scanned. We're all treated guilty because
[57:15.000 --> 57:21.320]  of one person committing a crime. They have 152 murders of husbands and wives. And so
[57:21.320 --> 57:28.560]  the French government says arguing and raising your voice is not allowed now. And 61 million
[57:28.560 --> 57:32.880]  French are all guilty until proven innocent. I mean, if you have car wrecks, do you just
[57:32.880 --> 57:38.360]  ban cars? Yes, they're talking about within five years in many areas trying to implement
[57:38.360 --> 57:46.400]  a system that takes your car over and a computer drives it. Oh, it'll save people. See how
[57:46.400 --> 57:53.080]  this works? Oh, some parents might abuse their children. So first 2000 then 20,000. Now they're
[57:53.080 --> 57:59.120]  talking about all new parents in the United Kingdom for at least six months, having cameras
[57:59.120 --> 58:05.560]  all over their home that the government monitors guilty until proven innocent with no evidence
[58:05.560 --> 58:11.480]  of a crime that you're a good parent. That's BBC. Within a year, they've gone from 2000
[58:11.480 --> 58:18.200]  to 20,000 and now saying all children. See, I mean, this is the opposite of the Bill of
[58:18.200 --> 58:23.040]  Rights, the Constitution, the opposite of the Magna Carta, the opposite of even any basic
[58:23.040 --> 58:28.720]  freedom. And it's being run by a predatory scientific dictatorship, a world government
[58:28.720 --> 58:33.920]  that openly says their plan is world extermination and reduction of the population by at least
[58:33.920 --> 58:42.680]  80%. So this is a prison grid being set up. We're all living in prison. Thank you for
[58:42.680 --> 58:52.260]  listening to GCN. Visit GCN Live.com today. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[58:52.260 --> 58:57.000]  you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could
[58:57.000 --> 59:01.480]  easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to
[59:01.480 --> 59:06.360]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government
[59:06.360 --> 59:11.400]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in
[59:11.400 --> 59:16.200]  some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist
[59:16.200 --> 59:20.960]  legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a
[59:20.960 --> 59:25.000]  threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather
[59:25.000 --> 59:29.960]  related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[59:29.960 --> 59:33.440]  and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[59:33.440 --> 59:40.400]  Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[59:40.400 --> 59:49.680]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[1:00:10.400 --> 1:00:19.560]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin,
[1:00:19.560 --> 1:00:33.560]  Texas, Alex Jones. Coming up in the next hour, we have a member of the Icelandic Parliament
[1:00:33.560 --> 1:00:39.720]  who's leading the charge against not letting the British government through banking fraud
[1:00:39.720 --> 1:00:44.320]  take over their nation. This is economic criminal conquest. They've used anti-terror
[1:00:44.320 --> 1:00:50.920]  laws to seize the bank accounts of the entire nation. Now, this is just unbelievably outrageous.
[1:00:50.920 --> 1:00:55.040]  That's coming up in Catherine Austin Fitz, the hour after that. We're simulcasting three
[1:00:55.040 --> 1:01:03.040]  hours of the four-hour radio show today, visually, as we do every day, at prisonplanet.tv for
[1:01:03.040 --> 1:01:08.960]  all the prisonplanet.tv viewers out there tuning in. We are simulcasting now. For the
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:18.560]  rest of the hour, Tyrell Ventura, son of Jesse Ventura, he's a filmmaker in his own right.
[1:01:18.560 --> 1:01:25.400]  Also is involved in a lot of other media production. He is an associate producer on the show, did
[1:01:25.400 --> 1:01:30.240]  a lot of the research. He's the guy that first primed the pump with his dad four or five
[1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:34.640]  years ago, about 9-11. And then when I first met Jesse Ventura four years ago and gave
[1:01:34.640 --> 1:01:39.080]  him terror storms and some other films about government-sponsored terror, he said, yeah,
[1:01:39.080 --> 1:01:44.880]  my son's introduced me to this. And so that helped break the ice and get him further informed
[1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:51.840]  about what was happening, leading us today to the number one new show on TruTV, Record
[1:01:51.840 --> 1:01:57.360]  Ratings for a New Show, a conspiracy theory with Jesse Ventura. And so very, very exciting.
[1:01:57.360 --> 1:02:04.240]  We'll talk about his favorite last six episodes, this final episode of the first season. It'll
[1:02:04.240 --> 1:02:10.680]  be internal politics if it doesn't get picked up for another, even longer season. Again,
[1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:16.240]  incredibly successful. Even the major trade publications are reporting that. Record ratings.
[1:02:16.240 --> 1:02:23.480]  How did this get on air? So many facets to discuss with Tyrell Ventura. Then we'll also
[1:02:23.480 --> 1:02:28.960]  get the inside scoop on, does he think his dad will run for president in 2012 and what
[1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:32.480]  that might look like. But that's coming up later in the interview. We'll also open the
[1:02:32.480 --> 1:02:37.640]  phones up some for your specific questions about the show, conspiracy theory on TruTV.
[1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:44.320]  The final episode of the seven-part series airing tonight at 9 p.m. central and of course,
[1:02:44.320 --> 1:02:50.000]  10 p.m. Eastern. And they always air last week's episode in the hour before. So that'll
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:54.920]  be 8 o'clock central, 9 o'clock Eastern if you missed that, the lead-in coming up tonight.
[1:02:54.920 --> 1:02:59.080]  We're going to break in a moment, Tyrell. But first off, going to you, it's great to
[1:02:59.080 --> 1:03:00.080]  have you with us.
[1:03:00.080 --> 1:03:04.240]  Well, I'm happy to be here, man. Thank you for all the help you've given us in the production
[1:03:04.240 --> 1:03:10.760]  of the show and for coming on and giving Jesse a good format to use a voice's opinion.
[1:03:10.760 --> 1:03:14.960]  Well, I want to thank you for including me in the show. I want to thank your father,
[1:03:14.960 --> 1:03:23.200]  the producer, the creator for keeping his word and really having this be a fair fact-finding
[1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:28.160]  show where Jesse really goes out. I mean, what you're seeing is what happens. This is
[1:03:28.160 --> 1:03:33.760]  real. And to be part of something real and trailblazing on TV, this is groundbreaking.
[1:03:33.760 --> 1:03:39.040]  Oh, I love the fact that we are, you know, so many shows you watch like the History
[1:03:39.040 --> 1:03:43.720]  Channel National Geographic and all that. They immediately go to the kind of government-sponsored
[1:03:43.720 --> 1:03:47.520]  sense of history and it was kind of nice, refreshing for all of us to work on a show.
[1:03:47.520 --> 1:03:52.800]  Let's give all these other ideas a chance. You know, let's not follow the status quo
[1:03:52.800 --> 1:03:56.480]  and let's go and find things that no one's talking about in mainstream media and then
[1:03:56.480 --> 1:04:04.000]  put them on TV and a lot of credit for true TV for having the guts and the fun to stand
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:09.760]  behind us and then put us on the air. Tyrell, I don't know how you did it. Your
[1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:14.280]  father, Jesse Ventura, had a bet going that it wouldn't air. He was glad to be proven
[1:04:14.280 --> 1:04:19.360]  wrong with the production staff. I mean, you guys put incredible amounts of work and research
[1:04:19.360 --> 1:04:23.680]  and this was a big gamble for you guys to do this and it's been successful, so I commend
[1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:28.960]  you. Well, thank you. Thank you. But yeah, I mean, we had a great production staff that
[1:04:28.960 --> 1:04:34.600]  we worked tirelessly all summer and then Paul, you know, put this thing together. It took
[1:04:34.600 --> 1:04:38.240]  a long time and a lot of convincing and a lot of different edits and a lot of that.
[1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:42.520]  They're going to get this show the way it is now and we're all happy with it. You know,
[1:04:42.520 --> 1:04:46.480]  we couldn't be happy with the ratings and everything else and get the fan mail coming
[1:04:46.480 --> 1:04:50.240]  in and then, you know, thank you for everyone for believing in the show and watching it.
[1:04:50.240 --> 1:04:54.600]  You know, it's been a wild ride to get this stuff on the air, but it feels good to finally
[1:04:54.600 --> 1:05:00.320]  have it out there. Absolutely. Tyrell Ventura, stay there. We're coming right back.
[1:05:00.320 --> 1:05:06.240]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones. I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator. Now

[1:06:01.800 --> 1:06:06.360]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[1:06:06.360 --> 1:06:12.120]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from
[1:06:12.120 --> 1:06:16.800]  underneath the Americans at home. I've turned a tremendous influence on our President and
[1:06:16.800 --> 1:06:23.320]  Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[1:06:23.320 --> 1:06:28.440]  citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the
[1:06:28.440 --> 1:06:34.600]  criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[1:06:34.600 --> 1:06:39.600]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[1:06:39.600 --> 1:06:43.920]  is saying, who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care. And right
[1:06:43.920 --> 1:06:50.200]  now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Full of
[1:06:50.200 --> 1:06:57.000]  the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:07:05.280]  at prisonplanet.tv. Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor
[1:07:05.280 --> 1:07:10.080]  in maintaining high energy and vibrant health? Because alkalizing water helps your body rid
[1:07:10.080 --> 1:07:15.440]  itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body. Disease organisms like
[1:07:15.440 --> 1:07:21.120]  bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment. Alchivision

[1:08:03.680 --> 1:08:32.160]  And this Wednesday, the team heads north to investigate secrets in the Arctic tundra.
[1:08:32.160 --> 1:08:50.400]  What do you think they're doing out there? What type of offensive weapon does harp have
[1:08:50.400 --> 1:08:55.480]  the potential to be? Not only can they manipulate weather, but the idea of knocking aircraft
[1:08:55.480 --> 1:09:04.920]  out of the sky and leaving no residual damage. What you're saying to me is scary. Just over
[1:09:04.920 --> 1:09:21.440]  the ridge, it comes into view. Now that Jesse and his team have seen the facility with their
[1:09:21.440 --> 1:09:32.880]  own eyes, it's time for them to confront the people that run it head on. The installation
[1:09:32.880 --> 1:09:38.440]  is open to the public, but no one is allowed in. And just as the former governor approaches
[1:09:38.440 --> 1:09:50.240]  the gate, he's stopped. Jesse is about to walk right on through, when suddenly.
[1:09:50.240 --> 1:10:17.840]  Now that was the first episode. The last episode in the first series is airing tonight. Tyrell
[1:10:17.840 --> 1:10:34.720]  Ventura, one of the associate producers. Tyrell, tell us about the episode coming up tonight.
[1:10:34.720 --> 1:10:51.360]  Today we've got 2012, and we've started with all the rumblings of the whole elastic calendar.
[1:10:51.360 --> 1:10:59.680]  What if some major catastrophe is on the horizon and the powerful elite know about it? Would
[1:10:59.680 --> 1:11:06.760]  your government let the people know about it ahead of time, or would they just set out
[1:11:06.760 --> 1:11:13.920]  to protect themselves? It's a great way to finish the season, and it's pretty frightening
[1:11:13.920 --> 1:11:18.320]  for things we find out. You're going to watch it tonight and see the things we've uncovered
[1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:23.440]  and the places that we sent Jesse in this episode. It's a fun one.
[1:11:23.440 --> 1:11:27.640]  Talking to you and your father and some of the other researchers early on, you guys thought
[1:11:27.640 --> 1:11:32.320]  that a lot of what we're hearing about 2012 is baloney, and clearly there's a lot of hype,
[1:11:32.320 --> 1:11:39.120]  a thousand different views and ideas about what's coming up with 2012. But then after
[1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:43.360]  you guys did your investigation, I don't want to give away too much for tonight, you got
[1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:48.640]  convinced that, well, the government and rich people clearly think something's going on,
[1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:53.360]  and they are getting ready. Exactly, exactly. And I've talked to numerous friends of mine
[1:11:53.360 --> 1:11:57.920]  in big oil and things like that, acquaintances I have out here living in Los Angeles, you're
[1:11:57.920 --> 1:12:02.400]  kind of around a lot of power and money, especially in the film industry. You talked to some of
[1:12:02.400 --> 1:12:07.200]  those guys and they all tell you about, oh yeah, my family has a compound built here,
[1:12:07.200 --> 1:12:10.600]  and that kind of thing, you're kind of like, but for what purpose? And it's like, well,
[1:12:10.600 --> 1:12:14.680]  to keep us protected, but then they'll never follow through the chain of thought of, well,
[1:12:14.680 --> 1:12:19.880]  why? What do you know that I don't know? And that's what this episode's kind of about.
[1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:25.120]  I mean, it's not specifically that the world's going to end in 2012, but if a catastrophic
[1:12:25.120 --> 1:12:29.120]  event were to face the world, you know, who's going to, who's going to get protected? Not
[1:12:29.120 --> 1:12:32.520]  you or me. You know, they're not going to, I don't think they'd care about protecting
[1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:36.920]  us. I think they'd care more about, you know, protecting their own power and influence and
[1:12:36.920 --> 1:12:40.720]  making sure that their families lived on in a catastrophic event.
[1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:48.440]  Well, exactly. In Switzerland, they have well appointed facilities with food and water underground
[1:12:48.440 --> 1:12:55.680]  for their entire population for at least two years. Russia has it for their entire population
[1:12:55.680 --> 1:13:01.520]  for at least a year. Other nations have this, but growing up in Dallas, they designate the
[1:13:01.520 --> 1:13:07.420]  underground car garages as nuclear fallout shelters, but our government has spent more
[1:13:07.420 --> 1:13:13.180]  than all these other governments combined on its own secret bases and underground facilities.
[1:13:13.180 --> 1:13:17.880]  And the public isn't even allowed to know about it. The public is told if we get attacked
[1:13:17.880 --> 1:13:22.840]  or an asteroid hits or a bio weapon gets released or a chemical weapon gets released,
[1:13:22.840 --> 1:13:26.960]  sorry, you're out of luck, you're dead. And that, of course, giving people an idea is
[1:13:26.960 --> 1:13:31.520]  what this episode gets into. I mean, this is such an important subject and that's what's
[1:13:31.520 --> 1:13:37.920]  so amazing. You guys set out to investigate, you know, these modern issues that the media
[1:13:37.920 --> 1:13:43.960]  calls conspiracy theories. And on issue after issue, you actually find out the real truth
[1:13:43.960 --> 1:13:49.080]  and come to the same perspective that I've got from deep research. And that is what is
[1:13:49.080 --> 1:13:53.880]  so amazing because, you know, I don't want to overstate my role. I was just one consultant
[1:13:53.880 --> 1:13:59.760]  of many. You guys had always found the truth by the time you checked with me and said,
[1:13:59.760 --> 1:14:04.920]  what is your view on this? Our view is this. And I was always amazed by the fact that you
[1:14:04.920 --> 1:14:15.200]  guys came to really in depth, well calculated spectrum analysis of what's going on.
[1:14:15.200 --> 1:14:18.680]  You know, that's just, it's just being able to kind of, you know, look at the news as
[1:14:18.680 --> 1:14:22.640]  a whole. And then when you do the research and then, you know, a lot of respect to write
[1:14:22.640 --> 1:14:26.600]  even Holly or other two associate producers, you know, they were fantastic. You can kind
[1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:30.560]  of see them on the show at the table and then, you know, all the investigative team, you
[1:14:30.560 --> 1:14:35.000]  know, once you start reading the news, but reading through the news and then looking at
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:38.480]  the, you know, sequence of events and stories and things like that, and then going out and
[1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:42.440]  finding the right people to talk to and the people that are voicing at the tempting opinion
[1:14:42.440 --> 1:14:47.520]  of them, the popular opinion, you can start finding a lot of facts. And it doesn't take
[1:14:47.520 --> 1:14:51.600]  that much. I mean, any person at home can, can, you know, with a few mouse clicks can
[1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:55.280]  start learning the truth. And, you know, if they start telling their friends, then you
[1:14:55.280 --> 1:14:59.480]  get a nice steamroll effect and then that's when you can get the system crack and hopefully,
[1:14:59.480 --> 1:15:03.680]  you know, bring it back to what it should be. And not a, not a, you know, ruling class
[1:15:03.680 --> 1:15:05.880]  versus poor class.
[1:15:05.880 --> 1:15:15.480]  Well, I agree with you. I agree with you. And it's just very, it was, it was just great
[1:15:15.480 --> 1:15:18.880]  working on the show. I mean, I, there was things I didn't know about. And I try to
[1:15:18.880 --> 1:15:22.960]  pride myself with keeping ahead of what, you know, the, you know, appearing through the
[1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:26.680]  news and knowing what the truth is. And there were things that we discovered that I didn't
[1:15:26.680 --> 1:15:31.520]  even know about, you know, from, from the Manchurian candidates and how deep that went.
[1:15:31.520 --> 1:15:37.240]  That sounds like, oh, because folks are completely real. Um, you know, to, to the, to the 2012
[1:15:37.240 --> 1:15:42.520]  stuff, you know, it was fascinating to work on the show.
[1:15:42.520 --> 1:15:45.800]  What is your favorite episode of the seven Tyrell?
[1:15:45.800 --> 1:15:52.120]  Um, my favorite episode, probably the seven would be probably nine, 11, just because that
[1:15:52.120 --> 1:15:56.160]  was the kind of one that me and my dad, you know, that I was able to bring to my dad and
[1:15:56.160 --> 1:16:00.400]  kind of open his eyes, his eyes up through. So I've always kind of had to say this, but
[1:16:00.400 --> 1:16:04.960]  warm place, you know, for, for uncovering the facts of that, of what really happened
[1:16:04.960 --> 1:16:10.360]  that day. Um, you know, I just feel, obviously we're not, we weren't told what, what, what
[1:16:10.360 --> 1:16:15.200]  happened that day. And then a lot of questions still need to be answered. And that was a
[1:16:15.200 --> 1:16:20.040]  fun one just to see dad really simply to see something that is a pet project of his and
[1:16:20.040 --> 1:16:23.760]  to finally see it put on the air and to see, you know, to see the, the pride that he had
[1:16:23.760 --> 1:16:27.280]  that he was able to get a show like that in the air. Great, uh, great episode. And I
[1:16:27.280 --> 1:16:33.280]  mean, they're all fun. They all have had moments of just, you know, fantastic candidness and
[1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:37.280]  from, you know, and great stories and great interviews and things like that, which is
[1:16:37.280 --> 1:16:41.240]  all you can ask for. And you're trying to put together a, you know, a television show.
[1:16:41.240 --> 1:16:47.160]  Well, we don't, we don't know yet if it's going to be picked up again, but, uh, talking
[1:16:47.160 --> 1:16:52.280]  to your father and others, uh, I mean, with the type of top rating success it's gotten
[1:16:52.280 --> 1:16:57.520]  for the channel. Something's going on if conspiracy theory with Jesse Ventura doesn't
[1:16:57.520 --> 1:16:59.640]  get picked up for a second larger season.
[1:16:59.640 --> 1:17:04.240]  Well, you never know. I mean, we hit the Builderbergs pretty hard. And if they own all the pages
[1:17:04.240 --> 1:17:08.960]  you never know, but no, ratings are good. And you know, the key is that thing. I want
[1:17:08.960 --> 1:17:12.640]  to leave your fans with a show and you believe in the show, you know, don't be afraid to
[1:17:12.640 --> 1:17:17.400]  write true TV and let them know you want to see a second season. You know, uh, I can
[1:17:17.400 --> 1:17:20.040]  give you their address right here and you know, right into them, let them know they
[1:17:20.040 --> 1:17:23.560]  read their mail, they listen to the viewers, they want to know what you want. And it's
[1:17:23.560 --> 1:17:24.560]  sure.
[1:17:24.560 --> 1:17:31.480]  Give, give, uh, give the address to true TV for folks. Uh, true TV, TRU TV, uh, 600
[1:17:31.480 --> 1:17:37.480]  third avenue, New York, New York, one zero zero one six. And, uh, you know, right in
[1:17:37.480 --> 1:17:41.240]  there, go online and they get a great website, you know, true TV dot com. They actually have
[1:17:41.240 --> 1:17:46.280]  a, uh, uh, under the contact list. You can go right on there and, uh, but they really
[1:17:46.280 --> 1:17:51.600]  pay attention, but they really pay attention to physical letter. Sure. You can go online
[1:17:51.600 --> 1:17:56.400]  to true TV dot com and send them emails and that's important, but physically writing a
[1:17:56.400 --> 1:18:01.960]  letter and keep the show on the air. You know, we love Jesse. We love this show. If you
[1:18:01.960 --> 1:18:05.840]  believe in the show and then, you know, write them and let them know, but it, uh, you know,
[1:18:05.840 --> 1:18:10.000]  I don't know. We'll find out last episodes tonight. Hopefully get some good ratings tonight
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:15.800]  and go out with it, go out with a bang and, and then we'll see what happens. Tyrell separately,
[1:18:15.800 --> 1:18:23.560]  guaranteed, uh, this will be big on DVD. I hope you guys make a three disc set and it
[1:18:23.560 --> 1:18:29.880]  needs to be in stores. Uh, is there a movement towards getting a DVD of the show out?
[1:18:29.880 --> 1:18:34.120]  Well, I'm sure there will be. I mean, I can't wait. I haven't, we haven't talked about it
[1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:37.400]  quite yet because we're just kind of finishing up with the season. I'm sure in the next few
[1:18:37.400 --> 1:18:40.720]  months that that discussion will come up and you know, I can't wait for people. I mean,
[1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:43.920]  there was a lot of stuff. You don't need an hour, you know, to tell each story, which
[1:18:43.920 --> 1:18:49.640]  is actually not about 45 minutes in, in TV time. And you know, that, that there's a lot
[1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:53.120]  of stuff we had to put on the editing floor that we wished we could put in, but that
[1:18:53.120 --> 1:18:57.240]  to take out. So hopefully in the DVD set, we could include some of that and also then
[1:18:57.240 --> 1:19:00.000]  I just, you know, the more people that have in their hand, the more people that share
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:02.960]  it and, and, and you know, learn the truth, the better.
[1:19:02.960 --> 1:19:07.880]  And plus this is groundbreaking. Hollywood, uh, as, uh, Michael Breverman said on this
[1:19:07.880 --> 1:19:13.080]  show is run by an old guard. They want to keep it in the left right paradigm. Uh, Michael
[1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:18.720]  is really a smart guy. He understands all this and, uh, this is groundbreaking. If this
[1:19:18.720 --> 1:19:24.240]  is successful, which it has been, it shifts the paradigm and so many high powered Hollywood
[1:19:24.240 --> 1:19:27.480]  people, they don't want to be liberals. They don't want to be conservatives. They want
[1:19:27.480 --> 1:19:32.120]  to get into reality and what's really happening. And, and, and so a lot of people are watching
[1:19:32.120 --> 1:19:36.440]  to see what happens with his show. So they can start going public and going public with
[1:19:36.440 --> 1:19:42.120]  their own projects. It's a revolution against the control paradigm going on in Hollywood
[1:19:42.120 --> 1:19:46.520]  right now. And you guys are, and of course me involved as well, are right in the middle
[1:19:46.520 --> 1:19:51.920]  of it. This is so wonderful that this has turned out this good, this professional, this
[1:19:51.920 --> 1:19:57.760]  true, uh, to the reality. Uh, and it's, it's just such a good thing, Tyrell. We're going
[1:19:57.760 --> 1:20:01.440]  to come back, talk more about the show, your dad, a lot more.

[1:21:00.800 --> 1:21:05.560]  Did you know that the dollar has lost 10% of its value against other currencies in the
[1:21:05.560 --> 1:21:10.760]  last 90 days? Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your
[1:21:10.760 --> 1:21:16.360]  retirement plans? Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic? Let's put
[1:21:16.360 --> 1:21:22.200]  this another way. Who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing
[1:21:22.200 --> 1:21:26.600]  power? Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did. Gold does not require
[1:21:26.600 --> 1:21:31.560]  trust in a third party. You can possess it in your hand. You can take it with you. Gold
[1:21:31.560 --> 1:21:36.880]  is real money. Gold is honest money. My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources. To

[1:22:02.520 --> 1:22:07.080]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[1:22:07.080 --> 1:22:12.840]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from
[1:22:12.840 --> 1:22:18.800]  underneath Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and
[1:22:18.800 --> 1:22:24.040]  they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[1:22:24.040 --> 1:22:29.160]  citizens to pay attention. For the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the
[1:22:29.160 --> 1:22:35.280]  criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[1:22:35.280 --> 1:22:39.760]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches
[1:22:39.760 --> 1:22:43.360]  and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody
[1:22:43.360 --> 1:22:49.880]  does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic. Get your

[1:24:14.320 --> 1:24:21.520]  Tyrell Ventura, filmmaker, researcher, son of Jesse Ventura is the guy that
[1:24:21.520 --> 1:24:29.680]  woke his father up. We are excited to have him with us today, talking about the final episode
[1:24:29.680 --> 1:24:36.080]  of the first season of Conspiracy Theory, which Jesse Ventura, the last show, premieres tonight,
[1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:43.440]  9 p.m. Central, 10 p.m. Eastern, on TruTV. Getting more into tonight's episode, I mean,
[1:24:43.440 --> 1:24:49.040]  as much as you're allowed to tell the public, give people an idea of why they want to tune in tonight,
[1:24:49.040 --> 1:24:56.560]  Tyrell. Tonight, because you're going to find out just how the government could prepare for
[1:24:56.560 --> 1:25:03.920]  potential disaster and leave you above ground. If any, that's kind of where we went with this
[1:25:03.920 --> 1:25:09.920]  episode. It was fascinating to begin and see that in every emergency situation, and all the
[1:25:09.920 --> 1:25:16.400]  government, and all their files, and what's the word, the power structure, keeping the power
[1:25:16.400 --> 1:25:23.920]  structure in place takes priority to the citizenry. It's very frightening to think about that,
[1:25:23.920 --> 1:25:32.560]  and that's what we get into this episode, and we also uncover some massive underground
[1:25:32.560 --> 1:25:38.960]  facilities in other such places, right underneath your nose. It's a fun episode,
[1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:46.000]  watching Jesse go bunker busting. We'll leave it at that. Believe me, I think this is one of the
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:52.080]  strongest episodes. What episode really is your favorite? Like I said, probably 9-11,
[1:25:52.800 --> 1:25:57.520]  and global warming was interesting, too, because I'd never, I always assume that the
[1:25:57.520 --> 1:26:01.280]  global warming was real, and like we say in the show, we're not debating the signs of whether
[1:26:01.280 --> 1:26:08.240]  it's real or not. We just are debating the ideas that are being presented to help stop
[1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:12.560]  this problem. Are they really going to stop the problem, or are they just going to make
[1:26:12.560 --> 1:26:17.840]  the wealthy more wealthy, and then make people rich? Yeah, personally, my favorite episode
[1:26:18.800 --> 1:26:23.040]  is the global warming, because you just destroyed them. You have Ben Sander. I mean,
[1:26:23.040 --> 1:26:28.320]  that made newspaper news that he admitted, the head of the UN program, that they took out
[1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:32.880]  five scientists who in the report said, man, it's not causing global warming,
[1:26:32.880 --> 1:26:39.680]  and the UN knew that 10 years ago, on top of Climate Gate, that is as big as the emails.
[1:26:39.680 --> 1:26:45.520]  Oh, it's fantastic. I mean, the timing of that episode, what was going on in the world at that
[1:26:45.520 --> 1:26:51.280]  moment, I couldn't have been better. It was just one of those great moments in time where you're
[1:26:51.280 --> 1:26:58.080]  on top of a story as another facet of the story breaks, and I was very critical at first, like
[1:26:58.080 --> 1:27:03.440]  global warming. Come on, guys, really, and then as more research we did, the more I was convinced
[1:27:03.440 --> 1:27:09.360]  that, yeah, there's definitely something sneaky going on there, and hopefully the more people
[1:27:09.360 --> 1:27:12.960]  you get talking about these issues, the more we can try to change it. I mean, that's the whole
[1:27:12.960 --> 1:27:17.520]  point of doing shows like this, that get you talking, get you aware of what's going on around
[1:27:17.520 --> 1:27:22.400]  you, not just being spoonfed, everything you see on television. And when you see those...
[1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:27.360]  I didn't open, I didn't really open my dad's eyes up to the world of conspiracy theory. He
[1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:30.880]  definitely did that when he took me to see the movie JFK, when I was a little kid,
[1:27:32.960 --> 1:27:37.600]  like 10, 11 years old. So he definitely opened it up to that. I was able to kind of
[1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:43.040]  open his eyes up to the 9-11, because all of us were kind of shocked and had our head in the
[1:27:43.040 --> 1:27:49.040]  sand or certain degree after that it happened, and at first he was real hesitant to buy in,
[1:27:49.040 --> 1:27:52.800]  but then I just kept saying, just watch the blues change, watch this, it raises enough
[1:27:52.800 --> 1:27:57.680]  questions that will make you think about it. And then that kind of got him rolling on 9-11 and
[1:27:57.680 --> 1:28:03.520]  then opened up. Really, that got him rolling and into creating this show to a certain extent,
[1:28:03.520 --> 1:28:08.160]  because it kind of opened his mind up to other vast, you know, the other conspiracies out there
[1:28:08.880 --> 1:28:14.480]  beyond just JFK. Well, sure, Tyrell, but I mean, talking to your dad, the last time he was down
[1:28:14.480 --> 1:28:19.200]  here in Austin with me for a few days, I mean, he said he knew about JFK, he knew about some of
[1:28:19.200 --> 1:28:23.360]  the things, but that you had brought him so many books and evidence and material, and then I'd
[1:28:23.360 --> 1:28:27.840]  given him material, and then all of that, that he went down to Mexico and spent months and months
[1:28:27.840 --> 1:28:33.120]  reading and watching and all and doing research, and then he really had this awakening, you know,
[1:28:33.120 --> 1:28:40.640]  to a higher level of information. And then you guys had just gotten back from HARP in Alaska,
[1:28:40.640 --> 1:28:44.880]  when I hooked up with you guys at the hotel there in LA, and I was talking to your dad,
[1:28:44.880 --> 1:28:50.080]  and he said, Alex, my head's spinning. When I lay down at night, it's literally spinning and opening
[1:28:50.080 --> 1:28:55.360]  up, and that's the same process that all of us go through, even when we think we know what's
[1:28:55.360 --> 1:29:00.080]  going on, even when we think we're aware of the New World Order and the shadow government,
[1:29:00.080 --> 1:29:07.600]  it just gets more and more crazy, and this microcosm of the underground bases,
[1:29:07.600 --> 1:29:12.640]  how there's this giant archipelago of underground bases and continuity of government facilities
[1:29:12.640 --> 1:29:18.240]  that are even on record do exist, imagine what we don't know exist, and the general public has no
[1:29:18.240 --> 1:29:23.120]  idea all this is going on beneath them. I know, and they have no idea that most of their taxpayers
[1:29:23.120 --> 1:29:28.080]  is paying for all, most of their tax money is paying for all of them, you know, I mean, you want to
[1:29:28.080 --> 1:29:32.080]  know what you're buying and what, I mean, they're taking your money to do all this, and to run this
[1:29:32.080 --> 1:29:36.800]  this regime to do this, you know, not to mention, you know, this telling of drugs, you know,
[1:29:36.800 --> 1:29:40.880]  not to mention the CIA telling the drugs of the cities, you know, the inner city streets and all
[1:29:40.880 --> 1:29:45.520]  of that, I mean, you know, they're totally abusing you, I mean, it's no different than when the,
[1:29:45.520 --> 1:29:49.920]  you know, feudal lords were abusing the serfs, you know, back in the 1300s, I mean.
[1:29:49.920 --> 1:29:57.280]  Stay there, Tyrell. We're on the march, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[1:30:10.720 --> 1:30:16.400]  can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[1:30:16.400 --> 1:30:21.680]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[1:30:21.680 --> 1:30:26.320]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[1:30:26.320 --> 1:30:30.960]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[1:30:30.960 --> 1:30:35.600]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:30:35.600 --> 1:30:41.040]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't

[1:33:01.680 --> 1:33:08.800]  Alex, we always hear the term New World Order. What is that? The New World Order is the establishments.
[1:33:08.800 --> 1:33:12.960]  Catch all phrase for all these groups and organizations. Everything we've talked about.
[1:33:12.960 --> 1:33:18.160]  It's the name of their agenda, the global elite's vision for the planet. It is a hellish prison
[1:33:18.160 --> 1:33:24.080]  planet controlled by them against a defenseless public. How come this isn't exposed? They did
[1:33:24.080 --> 1:33:28.960]  report on it. The Council on Farm Relations now goes on C-SPAN. I mean, it's incredible.
[1:33:28.960 --> 1:33:31.600]  Now more and more, they just come right out with the facts. We're setting up.
[1:33:31.600 --> 1:33:41.440]  Okay, here's the deal. We've got Tyrell Ventura, part of the production team,
[1:33:41.440 --> 1:33:48.320]  associate producer, camera guy, researcher on conspiracy theory. The last episode,
[1:33:49.200 --> 1:33:56.560]  2012, the underground bunker program. That is coming up tonight, 9 p.m. Central, 10 p.m.
[1:33:56.560 --> 1:34:01.920]  Eastern. Believe me, you want to tune in and watch it. The hour before, they will re-air last week's
[1:34:01.920 --> 1:34:07.200]  show, which Jesse thinks is the most wild one, and that's the Manchurian candidate program
[1:34:07.200 --> 1:34:12.640]  that we know is real. Now, is every person out there saying they're a Manchurian candidate real?
[1:34:12.640 --> 1:34:18.560]  No, but that's going to re-air tonight, 8 o'clock Central leading in to the new episode.
[1:34:18.560 --> 1:34:26.480]  But we have callers for the guest only, questions about Jesse Ventura, questions about the series,
[1:34:26.800 --> 1:34:32.240]  questions about the production of conspiracy theory with Jesse Ventura. Tyrell Ventura is here
[1:34:32.240 --> 1:34:39.760]  giving us a different perspective or different angle on the production, 1-800-259-9231,
[1:34:39.760 --> 1:34:47.920]  1-800-259-9231. Tyrell, I want to get into your dad and politics, but before we do that,
[1:34:47.920 --> 1:34:52.160]  I've been asking the questions here. Any other points or ideas you were getting into government
[1:34:52.160 --> 1:34:56.720]  drug dealing, how many times they've been caught CI aircraft crashing full of cocaine,
[1:34:56.720 --> 1:35:01.280]  and you got cut off by the break? Any more statements on that or anything else you want to
[1:35:01.280 --> 1:35:07.200]  say to the audience? The thing I want to say too is, I read the talk back section on the Facebook
[1:35:07.200 --> 1:35:13.760]  page for the conspiracy theory show and all of that, and I've gotten a lot of mail to the company
[1:35:13.760 --> 1:35:18.880]  and to the production office of people telling us, look, I've uncovered this or I've found that.
[1:35:20.160 --> 1:35:25.760]  We do take that seriously. If we do get picked up for a second season, we need materials. If
[1:35:25.760 --> 1:35:29.760]  you have anything out there that you've uncovered or you think of, don't be afraid to send it to
[1:35:29.760 --> 1:35:36.880]  us. If interviewing people out there and finding the truth of stories is what's going to help us,
[1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:42.160]  and if you've got a little nugget of information about something that maybe you or yourself are
[1:35:42.160 --> 1:35:46.960]  afraid to bring to public, we can. We can do that. If we get picked up, that's why you've got to
[1:35:46.960 --> 1:35:51.520]  watch the show and write the truth TV and get us picked up for a second season so we can keep
[1:35:51.520 --> 1:35:56.240]  telling the truth. We've got Alex doing it on radio and in DVDs, and if we can keep doing it
[1:35:56.240 --> 1:36:00.320]  on TV, that creates the ground swell, and hopefully we can change the world that way.
[1:36:01.360 --> 1:36:06.080]  Well, there's no doubt that there's a huge awakening taking place, and you guys were already
[1:36:06.080 --> 1:36:11.680]  aware of that, but producing the show, being out there on the street, really plunging with both
[1:36:11.680 --> 1:36:17.280]  feet into the alternative media and bringing it to mainstream media, building that bridge. This
[1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:24.560]  is unprecedented trailblazing, avant-garde event that we've all witnessed, and I've just been
[1:36:24.560 --> 1:36:30.000]  honored to be involved in it. What has it been like truly immersing yourself in this, Tyrell?
[1:36:31.040 --> 1:36:36.480]  Well, I mean, it's like you say, your head starts spinning after a while, and it's tough sometimes
[1:36:36.480 --> 1:36:43.120]  to decipher which person's telling you the truth, which person isn't, whose side should
[1:36:43.120 --> 1:36:50.160]  you take in this? Who's got the most information on any subject that's going to fit right
[1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:55.360]  for the show and the style of the show and the editing? It was a tough, long thing to put
[1:36:55.360 --> 1:37:00.640]  together. You're out there interviewing people, sending Jesse up to Alaska, going all over the
[1:37:00.640 --> 1:37:08.080]  place, and the government's not being helpful at all, and stuff. It was a fun shoot to do,
[1:37:08.080 --> 1:37:13.200]  it worked with great people all around, and Jesse had a great time doing it. Your head
[1:37:13.200 --> 1:37:19.840]  starts spinning after a while, because you get so inundated with information that you just kind
[1:37:19.840 --> 1:37:24.400]  of got to pick the best ones he got right there and go with them. I mean, we had so much more
[1:37:24.400 --> 1:37:28.960]  information on each of these subjects that we could put in, that we only have an hour to talk
[1:37:28.960 --> 1:37:33.360]  about, so you kind of got to just grab the best things he can and then hope for the best.
[1:37:35.280 --> 1:37:39.840]  I haven't talked to your dad the last three weeks since he left to get down to Mexico,
[1:37:40.720 --> 1:37:45.680]  talking to him or talking to him over email down there. He was super excited when I talked to him
[1:37:45.680 --> 1:37:50.000]  three weeks ago. Is he even more excited now that the ratings have just continued?
[1:37:50.640 --> 1:37:54.400]  Of course he's excited. I mean, we're now we're just kind of all waiting to see him and hope we
[1:37:54.400 --> 1:38:01.520]  get picked up. But yeah, he loves the show and is very happy with it. A lot of, like I say,
[1:38:01.520 --> 1:38:07.040]  a lot of love the true TV. They never once really stepped in and said, no, you can't talk about this,
[1:38:07.040 --> 1:38:13.440]  or yes, you can. I mean, they were very hands-off, and they're a very good company to work for,
[1:38:13.440 --> 1:38:16.880]  same-relation with Productions, which is the production company that put it together.
[1:38:17.920 --> 1:38:21.600]  Great people to work for, and like I say, very hands-off, surprising. I was expecting
[1:38:21.600 --> 1:38:26.800]  the worst, and you get into media conglomerates and their own by Turner and all that. You never
[1:38:26.800 --> 1:38:32.000]  know what you're going to get into, but they were fantastic to work with. Well, I was involved
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:39.040]  in a big production for Discovery Channel with the director who did some kind of monster brothers
[1:38:39.040 --> 1:38:44.880]  keeper and a lot of other top documentary films, the very top of the genre. And he said, I've never
[1:38:44.880 --> 1:38:50.320]  seen this in 20 plus years of filmmaking. The whole show was done, executives came in and said,
[1:38:50.320 --> 1:38:56.560]  we're not doing this anti-New World Order stuff. $3.4 million budget killed the entire
[1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:05.120]  program. And I've seen that over and over again, where the system does do this, but talking to
[1:39:05.120 --> 1:39:10.400]  your dad and other people in the production, they say that his personality, his gravitas,
[1:39:10.400 --> 1:39:16.240]  his research, you know, proving it, you know, he told true TV, you know, I'm going in to just find
[1:39:16.240 --> 1:39:21.120]  the truth. I have an open mind. He found the truth. It's our perspective because we are telling the
[1:39:21.120 --> 1:39:27.200]  truth. And it is the first national television show that actually comes from the reality
[1:39:27.200 --> 1:39:34.320]  perspective. And so how do, how do you think this got on air? I think it got on air. I mean,
[1:39:34.320 --> 1:39:39.280]  I think A, the truth TV, you know, believed in Jesse and, you know, had the guts, you know,
[1:39:40.320 --> 1:39:43.440]  the executives up there had the guts to say, you know, let's take a gamble on this and let's
[1:39:43.440 --> 1:39:46.800]  take a chance. But there's an audience out there for this, which we found that there is.
[1:39:47.760 --> 1:39:50.880]  And also, I think, you know, we probably got in under the radar a little bit, you know,
[1:39:50.880 --> 1:39:54.800]  Jesse hadn't really been on the public eye for a while. And, you know, I think we flipped it by
[1:39:56.800 --> 1:40:00.640]  in terms of the, you know, the media lead and the powers that be. I think we kind of flipped
[1:40:00.640 --> 1:40:05.520]  this one by him. But, you know, the great thing about Hollywood and television and all of that is
[1:40:06.400 --> 1:40:13.040]  as much as they will push an agenda, they still love money. And in TV, it's advertising dollars.
[1:40:13.040 --> 1:40:16.960]  So, you know, like you say, the more people that watch the show and more people that want it on
[1:40:16.960 --> 1:40:20.160]  the air and want this kind of information out there, you know, you got to write in film to
[1:40:20.160 --> 1:40:24.880]  pick it up for the second piece because, you know, they'll follow, they'll follow money before
[1:40:24.880 --> 1:40:31.120]  they'll follow. Well, it comes first. There is no doubt that if you put this on primetime,
[1:40:31.120 --> 1:40:38.160]  CBS, ABC, NBC or Fox, that this would be a number one show. And I know there's been some
[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:43.600]  discussion down the road. I mean, we need to get another season on cable, but this needs to go
[1:40:43.600 --> 1:40:48.160]  to primetime television. Now, I don't think the powers that be are going to let that happen.
[1:40:49.520 --> 1:40:54.880]  Who knows? I mean, that primetime television is so locked into, you know, sitcoms that mean
[1:40:54.880 --> 1:41:00.000]  nothing and everything else, but, you know, and, you know, more investigation stories that
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:04.080]  aren't true. You know, that's the great thing about being, you know, on, on true TV and working
[1:41:04.080 --> 1:41:08.800]  with them is, you know, we feel, and like it says, we do not, you know, we feel in not reality,
[1:41:08.800 --> 1:41:13.360]  but actuality, you know, and it's a great network to work with. This is a real Perry Mason. I mean,
[1:41:13.360 --> 1:41:18.240]  you guys go out into a real investigation. Yeah, we're not, you know, we're not CSI out there
[1:41:18.240 --> 1:41:21.600]  pretending to, you know, fake that, but these are real issues. We're dealing with the real,
[1:41:21.600 --> 1:41:25.760]  you know, real people we're interviewing, you know, and that's what's so fun about the show is,
[1:41:25.760 --> 1:41:30.720]  you know, going into play, then meeting, you know, meeting them about a man who says he's a
[1:41:30.720 --> 1:41:36.080]  mentoring candidate and I shook his hand, I talked to him and I don't know if he's telling the truth
[1:41:36.080 --> 1:41:41.120]  or not, but I can tell you this is that he believes in what he's saying. Well, we know those programs
[1:41:41.120 --> 1:41:46.480]  are real, you know, and, and, and we know he had the car wreck and suddenly remembered all of this,
[1:41:46.480 --> 1:41:52.080]  and that's exactly in the real cases how this has happened. I mean, CIA officers like Olson
[1:41:52.880 --> 1:41:56.240]  died in these mind control programs. I mean, this is declassified.
[1:41:56.240 --> 1:42:00.560]  Oh, yeah. Yeah. And, and, you know, but to get out there and meet those people and, and, and,
[1:42:00.560 --> 1:42:04.320]  you know, and, and, you know, I just, I hope, you know, I can't wait for another season because
[1:42:04.320 --> 1:42:08.240]  there's a lot of other stories out there that we weren't able to get this, this time around. And,
[1:42:08.240 --> 1:42:11.840]  you know, like I say, you know, and get a good, get good ratings tonight and everything else.
[1:42:11.840 --> 1:42:17.120]  So we'll have a lot of fun next year, you know. Tyrell, give people the address of the different
[1:42:17.120 --> 1:42:23.680]  websites that you run in association with the conspiracy theory show, contact info, contact
[1:42:23.680 --> 1:42:28.240]  for true TV, some of the places people can interface with you and send you information.
[1:42:28.960 --> 1:42:34.000]  Yeah, they can. I mean, you can, you can definitely send mail to true TV, which is at
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:41.440]  600 3rd Avenue, New York, New York 10016. I check out the conspiracy theory, Jesse
[1:42:41.440 --> 1:42:45.600]  Ventura at Facebook.com, you know, go on there and then, you know, post things on there. I
[1:42:45.600 --> 1:42:51.760]  definitely read all the, all the talk back stuff in there. You know, it's a go out of the true
[1:42:51.760 --> 1:42:56.880]  TV website right through there. And then, you know, just voice your opinion and be heard, you know.
[1:42:57.760 --> 1:42:58.960]  Okay. Shifting gears.
[1:42:58.960 --> 1:43:00.720]  I can't take friend requests from everybody though.
[1:43:02.880 --> 1:43:07.680]  But you're on Facebook and that's my private page. Don't send me all the friend requests.
[1:43:09.520 --> 1:43:17.440]  I know it's a, it's a deluge. Shifting gears. I have congressmen on. I have political analysts on
[1:43:17.440 --> 1:43:24.800]  every week. I have top reporters on people that really understand politics, the political landscape.
[1:43:24.800 --> 1:43:28.560]  The Republicans have no credibility. The Democrats have no credibility.
[1:43:28.560 --> 1:43:34.480]  No matter who we put into office, governments get bigger. The wars get bigger. Our freedoms get
[1:43:34.480 --> 1:43:40.160]  attacked. The banks are looting us. The Democrats and Republicans in all the major polls don't want
[1:43:40.160 --> 1:43:45.360]  the government takeover of healthcare. They found out it's not free healthcare. No such animal.
[1:43:45.360 --> 1:43:51.680]  It's a boondoggle to the insurance companies. Even Howard Dean, head of the Democratic Party,
[1:43:51.680 --> 1:43:57.200]  is saying that. So people are really angry. And every time I talk to political strategists,
[1:43:57.200 --> 1:44:05.040]  they see no one out there with the name recognition or who has the dark horse history
[1:44:05.840 --> 1:44:13.760]  and the populist backing to run for president, except for Ron Paul and Jesse Ventura.
[1:44:13.760 --> 1:44:21.840]  And some people say Ron Paul, almost 75, will be 77 if he got elected and that's too old.
[1:44:21.840 --> 1:44:25.840]  I think he's in great shape, jogs every day, exercises. I don't think that's the case.
[1:44:25.840 --> 1:44:32.480]  I love Ron Paul. I support him. I know Governor Ventura is, is really waking up truly,
[1:44:33.840 --> 1:44:37.920]  under, you know, just gets better and better like fine wine as he politically grows.
[1:44:37.920 --> 1:44:43.120]  He's a real guy. He keeps his word. He doesn't want special interest. He can't be bought off.
[1:44:43.120 --> 1:44:47.680]  The media is demonizing for that. He was against the war right when it first happened,
[1:44:47.680 --> 1:44:50.960]  when many others were for it and then later said they were against it.
[1:44:50.960 --> 1:44:54.720]  You know, I mean, he's been right on so many issues. I disagree with him on a few, but, you know,
[1:44:55.680 --> 1:45:01.360]  everybody disagrees with each other. Nobody agrees 100%. But all these experts and myself
[1:45:01.360 --> 1:45:08.000]  included think that, and I know he wants to have his own life. He said, Alex, when you get the age
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:14.640]  I am, that, that time becomes the most valuable thing, not money, not fame, not even, you know,
[1:45:14.640 --> 1:45:19.920]  he said, I just want to do the right thing. I'm torn between being politically involved with all
[1:45:19.920 --> 1:45:24.240]  the nastiness and having to be around all the crooks in Washington. You know, if I do do it,
[1:45:24.240 --> 1:45:29.520]  I would purely do it. If the people are ready and want a true revolution back to the Constitution,
[1:45:29.520 --> 1:45:32.560]  you know, these are the private discussions we've had and we've had some on air.
[1:45:32.560 --> 1:45:36.720]  Can you tell us as much as you can about what your dad's really thinking, what he's doing?
[1:45:36.720 --> 1:45:44.960]  He's got to know that he's being looked at to run for president and that he's needed Tyrell Ventura.
[1:45:46.240 --> 1:45:49.840]  You know, he does know that and he does, and he does, you know, hear the,
[1:45:49.840 --> 1:45:53.520]  hear the people out there. I mean, there's numerous websites and things, you know, asking,
[1:45:53.520 --> 1:46:00.160]  you know, Jesse run in 2012 and, you know, we need you and that kind of thing. And, and, you know,
[1:46:00.160 --> 1:46:05.040]  I can tell you this, my father's a big believer in faith and if faith opens the door and says,
[1:46:05.040 --> 1:46:08.800]  you know, looks like didn't put him in a position where he's going to run for president,
[1:46:08.800 --> 1:46:13.600]  he might. But ultimately, I don't think that's on his mind right now. He's not,
[1:46:13.600 --> 1:46:18.080]  he's not shown me anything behind closed doors. It's said that he has a site set on the presidency,
[1:46:18.080 --> 1:46:21.840]  if anything, he wants to surf more and then continue to work on the television show.
[1:46:22.720 --> 1:46:26.320]  But, you know, it's a strange, funny world we live in. I mean, and you never know what can
[1:46:26.320 --> 1:46:31.920]  happen. But as of right now, no, he doesn't have any political ambitions right now,
[1:46:31.920 --> 1:46:38.000]  except for just waking people up and continue to be a voice of independence and a voice of
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:42.560]  revolution. Well, that's what he's told me. And people always ask me to run for office.
[1:46:43.120 --> 1:46:47.920]  And the reason I've said I will probably never do it is that I can be pure here.
[1:46:47.920 --> 1:46:51.600]  Nobody's telling me what to say. I can do whatever I want. I can tell the truth.
[1:46:51.600 --> 1:46:57.200]  I can feel good when I go to bed at night. And politics itself is inherently corrupting,
[1:46:57.200 --> 1:47:02.640]  inherently it's about compromising. Your dad knows he can write books, he can do TV and radio
[1:47:02.640 --> 1:47:08.160]  interviews. He can't have a hit TV show telling the truth, trailblazing, and that, and that he
[1:47:08.160 --> 1:47:14.000]  wants to be from the grassroots part of the revolution against tyranny with the people
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  as a foot soldier, as a commando, as a Navy SEAL. That's, that's what he sees is that front line
[1:47:20.560 --> 1:47:24.800]  general out there, you know, on the front lines in the fight.
[1:47:24.800 --> 1:47:29.520]  You know what it is, Alex, is that one of the greatest experiences he ever had in his life
[1:47:29.520 --> 1:47:33.440]  was teaching political science at Harvard, you know, and they hadn't come out there for a,
[1:47:33.440 --> 1:47:38.720]  for a semester at Harvard, was able to teach all these young kids about third party politics and
[1:47:38.720 --> 1:47:45.120]  about, you know, 9-11 and about JFK and things like that. And he was able to really, you know,
[1:47:45.120 --> 1:47:48.960]  kind of, those are the people that are going to change the world. And I think my dad's kind of
[1:47:48.960 --> 1:47:52.880]  getting to a point in his life now where he would rather inspire the person who is going to change
[1:47:52.880 --> 1:47:57.200]  the world rather than change the world. He's taken it as, you know, pretty far now. And he's
[1:47:57.200 --> 1:48:01.920]  gone, you know, from governor and everything else. But, you know, I think, you know, as he gets up
[1:48:01.920 --> 1:48:06.560]  there, he wants to surf more. He kind of wants to pass the reins on. So, you know, hopefully,
[1:48:06.560 --> 1:48:10.080]  you know, there's someone out there who will have that curriculum and will have that, that, that
[1:48:10.080 --> 1:48:15.040]  third party know how to, you know, take, take this country back for us. And when it starts with all
[1:48:15.040 --> 1:48:19.680]  of us, it doesn't take one person. You can't put your face into one person. Tyrell, I want to hold
[1:48:19.680 --> 1:48:23.840]  you, Tyrell, I want to hold you five minutes in the next hour if you can. So we have two,
[1:48:23.840 --> 1:48:28.480]  two short segments to be able to take calls. You can do that, can't you? Of course. Okay,
[1:48:28.480 --> 1:48:35.840]  great. We're going to come back and go to Noel, Mark, Rose, Ron, Tim and others for Tyrell Ventura,
[1:48:35.840 --> 1:48:40.400]  specifically on the show or Jesse Ventura or on Tyrell. But I just want to say this here
[1:48:40.400 --> 1:48:45.520]  as we go to break. Studying the founding fathers, they weren't perfect. They were men,
[1:48:45.520 --> 1:48:50.720]  but they had good hearts and they were intelligent and they truly wanted liberty. George Washington,
[1:48:50.720 --> 1:48:56.880]  Thomas Jefferson, you know, those are icons. Those are my idols. And really getting to know
[1:48:56.880 --> 1:49:04.400]  your dad and studying now in hindsight, what he's done in his life and knowing that he doesn't want
[1:49:04.400 --> 1:49:10.960]  to be president. He doesn't want the power. He doesn't want to have the attention and be at
[1:49:10.960 --> 1:49:17.040]  all the big dinners. He just wants freedom. That's just like George Washington, who, you know,
[1:49:17.680 --> 1:49:22.880]  turned in his command. They wanted him to be king. He said no. And then they basically drafted him
[1:49:22.880 --> 1:49:26.640]  to run for president. And all he wanted to do was get back to Mount Vernon. He wanted to leave
[1:49:26.640 --> 1:49:31.840]  New York and, and, and, and, you know, go back to where Washington DC is today, his, his farm.
[1:49:31.840 --> 1:49:36.240]  And so that's exactly why we need your dad to run for president, because I've genuinely looked
[1:49:36.240 --> 1:49:40.240]  into his eyes. He doesn't want to do it because he doesn't want to be around all that corrupt
[1:49:40.240 --> 1:49:46.400]  slime. And, and he just wants to be a common person. But then he wants to run because he
[1:49:46.400 --> 1:49:51.520]  knows he wants to put real issues out. Imagine all these scumbag politicians, they would kill
[1:49:51.520 --> 1:49:56.000]  their children to be president. And that's why we don't want them to be president. Ron Paul doesn't
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:50:00.560]  want to run for president. I've talked to him privately. He wants to, but he fights tirelessly
[1:50:00.560 --> 1:50:05.040]  because of duty. Your dad doesn't want to be president, but he does want to stop the New World
[1:50:05.040 --> 1:50:10.480]  Order. Yes. Yes, of course. You know, like, yeah, no, completely. You know, you couldn't have said it best.
[1:50:10.480 --> 1:50:14.000]  You know, could have said it any better. That's, you know, he, he just wants to continue his
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:17.920]  right and to open people's minds up and to get people thinking, you know, thinking of third
[1:50:17.920 --> 1:50:21.440]  party. Don't fall into the left or the right. You know, be your own, be your own person,
[1:50:21.440 --> 1:50:25.040]  be an independent thinker, you know, study the founding fathers, you know, learn what they
[1:50:25.040 --> 1:50:29.600]  created here in this great, great country we have, you know, and then don't let it fall into the
[1:50:29.600 --> 1:50:36.240]  hands of the root. Well, your dad really does with all of his colorful history and all the
[1:50:36.240 --> 1:50:41.520]  great things he's done as a trailblazer. The fact that he doesn't want power, the fact that he just
[1:50:41.520 --> 1:50:47.680]  wants to be on a lonely sea shore by himself reading books. That's why he needs to be president
[1:50:47.680 --> 1:50:53.360]  or somebody like Ron Paul instead of Sarah Palin and the Democrats and the rep, all these
[1:50:53.360 --> 1:50:59.760]  painted trollops and trumpets who want power. That's the people we don't want in government.

[1:51:59.600 --> 1:52:05.040]  today. Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[1:52:05.040 --> 1:52:09.440]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[1:52:09.440 --> 1:52:14.000]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have outperformed
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:18.160]  even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again.
[1:52:18.160 --> 1:52:23.440]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[1:52:23.440 --> 1:52:29.360]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[1:52:29.360 --> 1:52:33.120]  for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically
[1:52:33.120 --> 1:52:38.560]  modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. So
[1:52:38.560 --> 1:52:44.640]  visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at
[1:52:44.640 --> 1:52:56.080]  877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the
[1:52:56.080 --> 1:52:59.920]  ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[1:54:33.840 --> 1:54:38.720]  rest of the hour. A member of the Icelandic parliament fighting the banker takeover over
[1:54:38.720 --> 1:54:42.560]  there. Very, very exciting. We've got this segment the next with Tyrell Ventura and I'm
[1:54:42.560 --> 1:54:47.200]  going to your calls with Tyrell. They're in the break. You made a statement that was not
[1:54:47.200 --> 1:54:51.520]  conclusive, but closer to conclusive. So finish up that statement about your dad.
[1:54:52.480 --> 1:54:56.080]  Well, essentially, they say this, like, you know, you asked me as the governor for president
[1:54:56.080 --> 1:55:00.720]  in 2012 and things like that. And I say, you know, right now I would say I'm probably 85%
[1:55:01.360 --> 1:55:06.880]  sure that he's not going to run for president. However, you know, his life has been so dynamic
[1:55:06.880 --> 1:55:11.280]  and strange that, you know, you never can stay never with him. So he, you know, who knows?
[1:55:12.640 --> 1:55:16.640]  You know, if you had told me that we'd have the conspiracy theory show on and we were getting
[1:55:16.640 --> 1:55:20.480]  great ratings a year ago, I'd have been like, oh, no way they'd ever put it on, but they did.
[1:55:20.480 --> 1:55:24.160]  If you told me he was going to run for governor and win, I'd have said no way, but he did.
[1:55:24.160 --> 1:55:28.400]  So you never know. You never know with him, but as of right now,
[1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:32.240]  doesn't look like he's running, but you know, never say never.
[1:55:33.680 --> 1:55:38.240]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen. Jesse wants to ride off into the sunset with his TV show and
[1:55:38.240 --> 1:55:42.320]  tell the younger generation, take your country back, but he might still run for president.
[1:55:42.320 --> 1:55:46.160]  And Noel in Ohio, you're on the air with Tyrell Ventura.
[1:55:47.200 --> 1:55:53.040]  Alex Tyrell. Pleasure to talk to you a little nervous. Sorry, but I've been reading the
[1:55:53.040 --> 1:55:59.040]  Grill and News Networks book, True Lies, and you're mentioned in it. And I thought it would
[1:55:59.040 --> 1:56:06.400]  be a good idea for maybe a second season show to do a show on the depleted uranium that though
[1:56:06.400 --> 1:56:12.880]  we're giving the troops is ammunition. That is a great subject because the army's
[1:56:12.880 --> 1:56:19.600]  own manuals admitted. Tyrell. That's a fantastic subject. I just saw a piece about that the other
[1:56:19.600 --> 1:56:24.320]  day that was devastated. You know, what's happening over there from using those and weaponry and
[1:56:24.320 --> 1:56:28.480]  things like that. Why are we, you know, there's no reason for us to depleted uranium and weapon.
[1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:33.760]  Well, it's a toxic waste, just like fluoride is a toxic waste. They put it in the water.
[1:56:33.760 --> 1:56:38.960]  It's a toxic waste from, uh, spent fuel rods at nuke plants. So they put it into weaponry
[1:56:38.960 --> 1:56:42.880]  when the army's own manuals in the 80s. So this will kill you dead in the hammer if you breathe
[1:56:42.880 --> 1:56:50.240]  it. Now they say, oh no, it's good for you. No, it's just typical, you know, it's
[1:56:50.240 --> 1:56:54.000]  the corporation trying to get rid of its toxic waste. So they figure out we can sell it to
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:58.640]  the military. They have good use for it. And then they always wrap themselves in the flag,
[1:56:58.640 --> 1:57:02.480]  but they could really care less about these troops. Oh, of course. Now they don't care.
[1:57:02.480 --> 1:57:06.960]  No, it's sad when you, when you, when you, you know, you see these young kids going over there,
[1:57:06.960 --> 1:57:10.640]  my generation and younger, you know, going over to Iraq on their, you know,
[1:57:10.640 --> 1:57:16.160]  fourth, fifth, sixth tour now, if not eighth, uh, you know, being used completely as corporate
[1:57:16.160 --> 1:57:23.360]  pawns, you know, it's terrible. No, anything else? No, it's gone. Mark and Oregon, quickly, go ahead.
[1:57:24.320 --> 1:57:29.200]  Morning, Alex and Tyrell. I want to congratulate you both on your very successful expose of
[1:57:29.200 --> 1:57:37.760]  evil here and the dark side. I'd like to make a quick comment and ask a question.
[1:57:39.360 --> 1:57:46.080]  I think your dad Tyrell and Ron Paul interchangeably on the ticket. I don't know which would
[1:57:46.080 --> 1:57:50.640]  be vice president or president, but that would certainly gather in a lot of people
[1:57:50.640 --> 1:57:57.120]  between the independent type of voter as well as the Republican voter and perhaps quite a
[1:57:57.120 --> 1:58:02.080]  few Democrats, something to think about. At any rate, I wanted to ask you, Tyrell, do you have
[1:58:02.080 --> 1:58:10.160]  any knowledge of, um, Turner broadcasting Ted Turner's, uh, conglomerate actually having ownership
[1:58:10.160 --> 1:58:15.760]  or a large interest in the true TV network? I'd heard it again. I don't have knowledge of it.
[1:58:15.760 --> 1:58:20.960]  I mean, I, I know that he doesn't have a controlling interest. He's, he's now out of the decision
[1:58:20.960 --> 1:58:25.520]  making process in those companies. Yeah. I think it's just called Turner broadcast.
[1:58:25.520 --> 1:58:29.600]  I think that's the name of it. Yeah. I mean, he's been, he's been out of decision making
[1:58:29.600 --> 1:58:34.720]  process for five, six years, but it doesn't matter. It's globalist above the globalist
[1:58:34.720 --> 1:58:39.520]  still running. That's a big question. Why was this allowed on TV? Because they can't hide the truth
[1:58:39.520 --> 1:58:52.080]  any longer. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCN live.com today. This is Alex Jones with five good
[1:58:52.080 --> 1:58:57.040]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation
[1:58:57.040 --> 1:59:02.160]  could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control
[1:59:02.160 --> 1:59:07.120]  how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of
[1:59:07.120 --> 1:59:12.400]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the
[1:59:12.400 --> 1:59:17.760]  country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only
[1:59:17.760 --> 1:59:22.480]  compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[1:59:22.480 --> 1:59:26.960]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five,
[1:59:26.960 --> 1:59:31.360]  a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks,
[1:59:31.360 --> 1:59:35.200]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science. One of my
[1:59:35.200 --> 1:59:42.160]  oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[1:59:42.160 --> 1:59:49.840]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[2:00:12.400 --> 2:00:21.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:22.560 --> 2:00:28.880]  I have thought long and hard about why this show is allowed on air, how the show is from our
[2:00:28.880 --> 2:00:34.240]  perspective and proves the government's doing all this evil stuff, because that's what Ventura
[2:00:34.240 --> 2:00:38.960]  found. And why is it on air? They know they've got to mix a little bit of this in. They can't
[2:00:38.960 --> 2:00:43.920]  just fully ignore it. It's gotten too big. Too many people know, so they put it on true TV.
[2:00:45.520 --> 2:00:49.680]  And also, they know it's very popular, so they'll make money. They think so little of you,
[2:00:49.680 --> 2:00:54.240]  it's just right out in the open. But I think they've miscalculated. It's also titrating the dose.
[2:00:54.240 --> 2:00:58.240]  It's like people that are around cobras. They take small amounts of the venom until they get
[2:00:58.240 --> 2:01:02.880]  immune to it. And the elite are slowly, kind of like they've admitted world government now.
[2:01:03.440 --> 2:01:08.560]  But I think they've miscalculated. I mean, it's hurting them worse to ignore it all,
[2:01:08.560 --> 2:01:12.640]  because then people say, well, why are they hiding it? I think they're just trying to put it right
[2:01:12.640 --> 2:01:17.440]  out in the open. Tyrell, you think that's a good assessment? Oh, I think, I think, I think it's
[2:01:17.440 --> 2:01:20.880]  that. And also, yeah, I think that, you know, they kind of feel that, you know, we'll let them
[2:01:20.880 --> 2:01:24.400]  talk about this and have this little corner and, you know, they're never going to be a threat to
[2:01:24.400 --> 2:01:28.160]  us. But yeah, the more, the more people are talking about it, the more people are exposed to
[2:01:28.160 --> 2:01:32.240]  truth, you know, that that will get that ball rolling and get us, you know, get, take our,
[2:01:32.240 --> 2:01:37.120]  take our liberty back, take our country back, you know, and stop programs like, you know,
[2:01:37.120 --> 2:01:42.320]  Mentoree and Canada's programs, you know, stop being fleeced for our money and, you know,
[2:01:42.320 --> 2:01:48.720]  find out what the government has as plans, as backup plans in case of a catastrophe on an
[2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:53.600]  epic scale. You know, how is it going to stay with people? Ask questions with the government.
[2:01:53.600 --> 2:01:56.960]  Absolutely. I'm going to try to... That's the mental thing that we have, you know.
[2:01:56.960 --> 2:02:02.000]  Absolutely. I'm going to try to jam in some quick calls. Quick question for Tyrell Ventura.
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  Rose in Montana, you're on the air. Hi, Alex and Tyrell. I'm first-time caller. Alex, I want to
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:13.120]  thank you very much because without your tireless efforts, I don't think any of this would be possible.
[2:02:13.120 --> 2:02:17.360]  And for the first time in three years since I became awake, I'm starting to feel hopeful
[2:02:18.160 --> 2:02:23.360]  because, you know, you just keep pummeling, pummeling, pummeling. Exactly. We now are having
[2:02:23.360 --> 2:02:27.600]  victory. Look at Copenhagen setting up world government going down in flames. We're having
[2:02:27.600 --> 2:02:32.720]  victory on every level. Tyrell? I agree. You know, like I said, the more people talking about it,
[2:02:32.720 --> 2:02:38.000]  the more, you know, programs like Alex's, Wistman 2, shows like our watch, and the more
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:42.160]  you get that piece of truth out there, what people hang onto it, you know, or at least just
[2:02:42.160 --> 2:02:46.480]  a different opinion. I mean, even if you don't believe anything that we're saying, at least
[2:02:46.480 --> 2:02:51.280]  just Wistman 2 has different opinions in your life. Momentum is shifting towards liberty.
[2:02:51.280 --> 2:02:56.880]  Freedom is on the rise. Tyranny's been rising for a long time. Now, liberty is rising.
[2:02:58.160 --> 2:03:02.240]  Thank you very much for that because without your tireless efforts, and those who have followed
[2:03:02.240 --> 2:03:07.280]  you, this would not be possible. And today was, yesterday was the first day that I felt really
[2:03:07.280 --> 2:03:17.040]  hopeful when, you know, your program on what was going on with TARP and AIG and European media
[2:03:17.040 --> 2:03:23.040]  bursting loose on H1N1. Okay. And I thank you so much because I don't think true TV would be
[2:03:23.040 --> 2:03:32.480]  possible without your work. That's right. The head of the EU health councilist said it was all a
[2:03:32.480 --> 2:03:39.280]  fraud, dangerous vaccine to make money. Again, we've been purely vindicated. Tyrell, so much
[2:03:39.280 --> 2:03:45.520]  is coming out now. The government's being just absolutely discredited. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean,
[2:03:45.520 --> 2:03:51.440]  as you can find the truth, I mean, every like news article they put out, you know, it was
[2:03:51.440 --> 2:03:55.360]  trading their end or what they want you to believe, you can find an alternate viewpoint.
[2:03:55.360 --> 2:04:00.000]  And like I said, it's even if you don't believe every alternate viewpoint you come across,
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:03.440]  you know, you have to leave yourself open. It shouldn't just be a right or left debate.
[2:04:03.440 --> 2:04:08.320]  You know, you can't just be spoon-fed your whole life. It's okay to be a free thinker.
[2:04:08.320 --> 2:04:11.280]  Even if you're proven wrong, you could have a great theory or a great, you know,
[2:04:11.280 --> 2:04:15.840]  could like we've tracked down many conspiracies that ended up being dead ends or facts ended up
[2:04:15.840 --> 2:04:20.720]  being untrue. So we had to move in a different direction. But that's the nature of investigation,
[2:04:20.720 --> 2:04:26.960]  the nature of good public discourse, you know, is being able to have all sorts of viewpoints
[2:04:26.960 --> 2:04:33.040]  presented. Well said Tyrell Ventura. Great job on the show. And I want to be clear, it's you,
[2:04:33.040 --> 2:04:37.440]  the audience, it's you, the people getting the word out of the grassroots that deserve all the
[2:04:37.440 --> 2:04:42.640]  credit for the awakening that's happening. I'm only a small part of that. Tyrell is a small part.
[2:04:42.640 --> 2:04:48.480]  Ventura is a small part. But all of us together is extremely powerful. Tyrell, hope to see you
[2:04:48.480 --> 2:04:52.720]  in Minnesota or out in Los Angeles or come to Austin soon. Hope the show gets picked up again
[2:04:52.720 --> 2:04:58.000]  so I can work with you some more. We love what you're doing. Tell your dad I said hi and surfs up.
[2:04:59.600 --> 2:05:05.760]  Take care. Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle
[2:05:05.760 --> 2:05:10.960]  and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I
[2:05:10.960 --> 2:05:16.640]  can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[2:05:16.640 --> 2:05:21.920]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[2:05:21.920 --> 2:05:26.560]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[2:05:26.560 --> 2:05:31.120]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[2:05:31.120 --> 2:05:36.560]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your
[2:05:36.560 --> 2:05:41.760]  ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.

[2:07:02.160 --> 2:07:07.200]  should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily
[2:07:07.200 --> 2:07:12.560]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power
[2:07:12.560 --> 2:07:17.440]  your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity
[2:07:17.440 --> 2:07:22.400]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[2:07:22.400 --> 2:07:27.920]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[2:07:27.920 --> 2:07:33.120]  the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands
[2:07:33.120 --> 2:07:37.840]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[2:07:37.840 --> 2:07:42.320]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[2:07:42.320 --> 2:07:46.480]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more

[2:08:01.840 --> 2:08:07.520]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[2:08:07.520 --> 2:08:17.600]  She's a member of Iceland's parliament. She's also the chairman of her party.
[2:08:18.160 --> 2:08:24.000]  She's been involved in Friends of Tibet. She's been involved all over the world fighting tyranny.
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:31.920]  Her bio is lengthy. Her name is Pirgita Jones-Dottier, or daughter of Jones. And we are very
[2:08:31.920 --> 2:08:38.080]  honored to have her joining us via video Skype from the capital of Iceland. She is with us
[2:08:38.080 --> 2:08:44.160]  for the next 52 minutes, and we really appreciate her coming on in her busy schedule. We'll give
[2:08:44.160 --> 2:08:50.320]  you the party's website and a lot more information. Here is the London Guardian. Britain's anti-terror
[2:08:50.320 --> 2:08:55.520]  laws being deployed for all sorts of ends, as Iceland has just discovered. They declared the
[2:08:55.520 --> 2:09:02.560]  country basically terrorist, stole many of their bank accounts. They want the country to pay private
[2:09:02.560 --> 2:09:08.720]  debts for derivatives to Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of England, and others. And the country,
[2:09:08.720 --> 2:09:12.800]  just like third world nations have been taken over, is being taken over by offshore banks. The
[2:09:12.800 --> 2:09:18.080]  people are saying, no, now the banks are backing off, saying, well, maybe we had assets we didn't
[2:09:18.080 --> 2:09:23.040]  tell you about and you don't owe that much. It's all made up. If they can win their fight there,
[2:09:23.040 --> 2:09:27.840]  it will send a domino effect throughout Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America, the United States.
[2:09:27.840 --> 2:09:33.760]  This debt is created through fraud. We also have Bankstergate with Tim Geithner, open discussions
[2:09:33.760 --> 2:09:38.800]  of him being indicted for fraud, getting money for himself and others out of bailout money,
[2:09:38.800 --> 2:09:44.400]  and ordering the government to cover that up at AIG. And so we'll get her take on Bankstergate
[2:09:44.400 --> 2:09:52.160]  as well. But we are very honored to have Birgitta Jones-Dottier on with us. Thank you so much for
[2:09:52.160 --> 2:09:58.320]  coming on. Well, thanks for having me. However, I have to correct one thing about the banks,
[2:09:59.040 --> 2:10:04.000]  the bank that we are supposed to be covering was a privately run bank by Icelanders.
[2:10:05.120 --> 2:10:11.680]  But it made the investments in the derivatives. Yes, of course. So we were basically conned.
[2:10:11.680 --> 2:10:17.840]  The entire nation was conned. And the thing is that the Brits and the Dutch, they want us to pay back
[2:10:17.840 --> 2:10:25.680]  with huge interest. So they're actually making money of us, money that never reached Iceland.
[2:10:25.680 --> 2:10:29.920]  And most Icelanders had never heard of these accounts before everything collapsed.
[2:10:30.560 --> 2:10:37.760]  And they put the terrorist law on us, almost like guinea pigs, because they had not tried to use that
[2:10:37.760 --> 2:10:43.920]  particular terror act law. And instead of putting it on the bank in the beginning, which was privately
[2:10:43.920 --> 2:10:50.000]  owned, they put it on Iceland. And actually, during our incredible system, almost entire system
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:57.040]  collapsed when all the big banks collapsed, they decided to put the terrorist act on us. So we were
[2:10:57.040 --> 2:11:02.960]  very close to not having food in Iceland. Amazing. Now, start at the beginning for people that don't
[2:11:02.960 --> 2:11:09.120]  understand what's happening and why this is so important globally with what happened in Iceland,
[2:11:09.120 --> 2:11:14.960]  the chain of events. And now the incredible fight you and others are leading against the banking
[2:11:14.960 --> 2:11:21.680]  cartel, literally turning your country into a vassal state through economic fraudulent conquest.
[2:11:22.960 --> 2:11:28.240]  Well, it all happened a few years ago. All the big banks were actually government owned or the
[2:11:28.240 --> 2:11:35.360]  people owned them. And we had a conservative party run Iceland for 18 years. And during that period,
[2:11:35.360 --> 2:11:40.640]  they basically privatized everything the people owned, including the banks a few years ago. And
[2:11:40.640 --> 2:11:47.920]  they sold the banks relatively cheaply to friends and allies. And they made in a very short period
[2:11:47.920 --> 2:11:55.120]  of time, all the legislation vanished, that would have them, you know, having to not expand as quickly
[2:11:55.120 --> 2:12:01.840]  as they did, they became five times bigger than the annual GDP. And so when they collapsed, you
[2:12:01.840 --> 2:12:12.480]  can imagine how huge blow it was for the nation. Now, today, in Iceland, there's been what almost
[2:12:12.480 --> 2:12:17.840]  a year of protest and people taking over government buildings and saying no. And a key vote is coming
[2:12:17.840 --> 2:12:22.880]  up by the people of Iceland on whether or not you're going to capitulate to this fraud. Can you
[2:12:22.880 --> 2:12:30.800]  walk us through that? Yes. Just around the time when, you know, the banking system collapsed,
[2:12:30.800 --> 2:12:37.760]  protest started, people were actually quite shocked because they had been conned. And we wanted to get
[2:12:37.760 --> 2:12:45.520]  the government out of office, which is impossible by legislation. So we had the soft revolution
[2:12:45.520 --> 2:12:52.320]  driving the government away. And then when we got a new government, which apparently is just like
[2:12:52.320 --> 2:12:59.600]  the old one, unfortunately, with all their secret secrecy and bound to the IMF, which, you know,
[2:12:59.600 --> 2:13:07.760]  I really think that we need to get a plan B to get rid of. There's been an ongoing protest and it's
[2:13:07.760 --> 2:13:12.480]  growing bigger and bigger again, because people are very unhappy with the way the new government
[2:13:12.480 --> 2:13:18.000]  is handling things, even though it is the first left-wing government in the history of Iceland.
[2:13:19.760 --> 2:13:26.240]  Because you can't run left-wing politics with the IMF controlling the national budget.
[2:13:26.240 --> 2:13:32.160]  And we've been, you know, in the parliament that just got fresh into parliament, you know, I'm not
[2:13:32.160 --> 2:13:38.160]  really a politician by heart. And our movement, we were created out of all the different grassroots
[2:13:38.160 --> 2:13:46.000]  that popped up after the collapse. And we got just in eight weeks, more than 7% of the vote. And we
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:52.560]  didn't have any money, no big money, people behind us, just a relentless effort of ordinary people
[2:13:52.560 --> 2:14:01.200]  who wanted to build a bridge between parliament and the people. So, you know, when we got into
[2:14:01.200 --> 2:14:08.560]  parliament, the ISF dilemma landed in our lap. And we found out that they wanted to pass this huge
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:17.680]  burden on the nation without even the parliamentarians seeing the contract between Iceland and the
[2:14:17.680 --> 2:14:25.520]  Dutch and the British government. So, the fight started there. And fortunately, the contract
[2:14:25.520 --> 2:14:31.440]  was leaked. And that has been a great blessing for us that so much of the material they wanted to hide
[2:14:31.440 --> 2:14:37.680]  from us and the nation has been leaked, on the sides like WikiLeaks and into the media in Iceland.
[2:14:39.360 --> 2:14:44.880]  However, we passed, we managed to change the contract this summer, which was actually
[2:14:44.880 --> 2:14:52.400]  a totally unique and a new way also for other nations that are suffering from, you know,
[2:14:52.400 --> 2:14:59.440]  spending all their national budget, all the GDP on dispaying interest of foreign debt. So, in the
[2:15:00.480 --> 2:15:06.320]  changes on the bill, we managed to put in that we would never pay more than we could handle.
[2:15:06.960 --> 2:15:10.960]  And of course, the British and the Dutch did not like that. And they demanded that we would
[2:15:10.960 --> 2:15:19.840]  actually change Icelandic law in order for them to accept it. And our government decided to listen
[2:15:19.840 --> 2:15:30.080]  to them. Unbelievable that they pushed another bill through with, there was a question if they
[2:15:30.080 --> 2:15:35.120]  would actually manage to get majority for the not. And when they passed it during that time,
[2:15:35.120 --> 2:15:44.240]  which was by force, the nation got up to its feet and 23 percent of the nation signed the petition
[2:15:44.880 --> 2:15:51.840]  asking the president of Iceland, who is the last person to sign all law, to not sign this law and
[2:15:51.840 --> 2:15:56.720]  let the nation vote on it. So this is the first time in Icelandic history since we were there
[2:15:56.720 --> 2:16:03.680]  on becoming a sovereign state when we got out of the Danish colonialism in 1944. So it's truly
[2:16:03.680 --> 2:16:10.400]  historical. And I really hope that we will have the courage to vote no to this out of courage,
[2:16:10.400 --> 2:16:15.520]  but not, yes, out of fear, because of course, there is a great spin. And that is why it is so
[2:16:15.520 --> 2:16:20.480]  important for the aesthetic people to feel the support of the people of the world who are fed up
[2:16:20.480 --> 2:16:29.600]  with bailing out the bankers. We're talking to Birgitta Jones, a member of the Icelandic parliament.
[2:16:29.600 --> 2:16:35.760]  She is also the chairman of her new party that is rising to power there as people see that they're
[2:16:35.760 --> 2:16:42.080]  actually standing up for the population against fraud. The population has been on the edge of
[2:16:42.080 --> 2:16:46.960]  near revolt. We've played those videos here of people taking over banks, government buildings,
[2:16:46.960 --> 2:16:53.920]  you know, mainline families, middle class, wealthy people, working class, because literally
[2:16:53.920 --> 2:17:01.520]  the country was imploded by design. Food wasn't even coming in. They export and import in a lot of
[2:17:01.520 --> 2:17:07.840]  their food, just absolutely hellish. So I want to go over the fact that some news reports have said
[2:17:07.840 --> 2:17:15.760]  five times your GDP that the bank went into with derivative scams. Some have said 10 times GDP.
[2:17:15.760 --> 2:17:23.120]  You're saying five times GDP. And I mean, the actual bondage, the financial enslavement to the
[2:17:23.120 --> 2:17:28.080]  government, to these people and that they were doing it all in secret, just like our banker take
[2:17:28.080 --> 2:17:34.480]  over in October of 2008 was done in secret and everything else is done in secret by these banks
[2:17:34.480 --> 2:17:40.880]  that form the shadow government. So can you speak to the type of hardship this has created for your
[2:17:40.880 --> 2:17:49.280]  country and the secrecy that these people were trying to engage in to get your country to sign
[2:17:49.280 --> 2:17:56.960]  on to even more tyranny? Well, what the previous government managed to do was to create a law that
[2:17:56.960 --> 2:18:03.680]  allowed the banks to maintain complete secrecy of like, you know, their, their loan books and so
[2:18:03.680 --> 2:18:10.880]  forth. Even if now all the banks, especially the bank that controls the ISA accounts is now,
[2:18:11.920 --> 2:18:16.880]  you know, taken over by the government, we, the parliamentarians can't not even the minister
[2:18:16.880 --> 2:18:24.160]  of finance has seen what is supposed to be the bond or the assets that are supposed to cover ISA.
[2:18:25.600 --> 2:18:33.040]  And I've asked for it from day one since last summer, officially and unofficially. And they,
[2:18:33.040 --> 2:18:42.400]  they're just the state within the state, the liquidity committees. However, I think people
[2:18:42.400 --> 2:18:48.880]  are awakening to the fact and starting to demand more, which they didn't. And I think one of the
[2:18:48.880 --> 2:18:54.640]  good things about this difficult situation, which means, you know, there's a lot of people moving
[2:18:54.640 --> 2:19:01.280]  away from Iceland, there's a wave of, there's a huge brain drain already happening. And we used
[2:19:01.280 --> 2:19:07.920]  to be the fifth richest nation in the world. And now we're ranked among the fourth most likely
[2:19:07.920 --> 2:19:14.960]  nation to go bankrupt or go into debt moratorium. And, you know, we had very little poverty here.
[2:19:15.760 --> 2:19:21.600]  There was a very little gap between the rich and poor. However, that all changed with the
[2:19:22.320 --> 2:19:26.160]  new billionaires that basically got everything given on a silver platter.
[2:19:27.360 --> 2:19:33.600]  And are now responsible for the reason why we're here, but like their assets have not been frozen
[2:19:33.600 --> 2:19:38.800]  yet. Birgit, just stay there. We're going to come right back to you after this break. But this is
[2:19:38.800 --> 2:19:43.840]  the story. This is what the IMF, the World Bank does in countries all over the world. They're
[2:19:43.840 --> 2:19:50.320]  done destroying a third world. They're now moving in to loot the first world, one of the most wealthy
[2:19:50.320 --> 2:19:56.640]  nations on earth overnight becoming poor. And they're saying, no, this debt is a fraud. This is
[2:19:56.640 --> 2:20:02.000]  a scam. You bankers ran off with the money. We don't owe you more money. You may be new to

[2:24:09.120 --> 2:24:14.880]  Birgitta Jones-Dottier, member of the Icelandic parliament, leading the charge against the bank
[2:24:14.880 --> 2:24:22.880]  or takeover. Americans are losing their jobs or having their pay cut. Their savings are being
[2:24:22.880 --> 2:24:29.200]  destroyed. We're going through the same process as Main Street dies, as everything is fed into the
[2:24:29.200 --> 2:24:35.360]  big banks. But they tell Americans, oh, we've got a great economy. So we're in the same boat
[2:24:35.360 --> 2:24:43.440]  as Iceland. Going back to our guest, Birgitta, looking at this and the fraud they're engaged in,
[2:24:43.440 --> 2:24:50.960]  go over the con for people, the type of fraud these banks are engaged in, and then tie that in
[2:24:50.960 --> 2:24:57.280]  with the spin they're putting out to counter you and other Icelanders that are refusing to become
[2:24:57.280 --> 2:25:08.480]  slaves. Well, I guess the con started relatively sneakily, because they were sort of passing
[2:25:08.480 --> 2:25:14.640]  loans between the banks with nothing really behind it. They were making all these fancy bundles and
[2:25:14.640 --> 2:25:23.280]  stuff like that. And I honestly don't have the English terms for it. But then in the end, when
[2:25:23.280 --> 2:25:29.680]  they were truly becoming desperate for cash, they started to con elderly people and immigrants,
[2:25:30.880 --> 2:25:35.680]  asking them to move their savings to high-risk accounts, saying that they were no risk accounts,
[2:25:35.680 --> 2:25:43.600]  and telling them that even though it had better interest, it would be still completely safe for
[2:25:43.600 --> 2:25:50.640]  them to save the money there. And then they basically rinsed out all that money into God knows
[2:25:50.640 --> 2:25:59.120]  what, probably it's all resting in total islands or something like that. The spin that's happening
[2:25:59.120 --> 2:26:05.920]  right now with the Icelandic government and the media, it's almost shocking. It feels like they are,
[2:26:05.920 --> 2:26:14.880]  you know, somehow working with the Dutch and the British in order to make us submit to their
[2:26:14.880 --> 2:26:21.040]  fear-mongering, because one of the mantras they had in parliament when they were forcing this bill
[2:26:21.040 --> 2:26:27.120]  through was that Iceland would become completely isolated. We would become Cuba of the north
[2:26:27.120 --> 2:26:35.200]  or the Zimbabwe of the north, Nigeria of the north. And that, you know, everybody would stop doing
[2:26:35.200 --> 2:26:41.600]  business with us. We could not get loans anywhere. And our export would be in danger. Nobody would
[2:26:41.600 --> 2:26:47.600]  want to invest. So financial terrorism. We have the same thing here in October of 2008. They said,
[2:26:47.600 --> 2:26:52.800]  you will have martial law. You will have a collapsed economy. Give us unlimited power.
[2:26:52.800 --> 2:26:56.560]  And then now there's talk of criminal charges against Geithner and others. I mean,
[2:26:56.560 --> 2:27:02.080]  they're committing crimes. It's the same people that robbed us, robbed you. Why not have the people
[2:27:02.080 --> 2:27:07.920]  of Iceland swear out warrants and arrest these bankers that engaged in fraud? That will end
[2:27:07.920 --> 2:27:14.720]  their propaganda immediately when the people openly see them in irons. Yeah, that's what everybody's
[2:27:14.720 --> 2:27:20.000]  waiting for. There is actually, I'm on a committee that has just been funded to go through the,
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:27.040]  there is a truth commission report coming out early next month. And everybody's waiting in
[2:27:27.040 --> 2:27:33.520]  anticipation about what is going to be in that report. I hope that both politicians who were
[2:27:33.520 --> 2:27:42.080]  sleeping or openly engaged in this scam and allowing all the institutions to be laid down or
[2:27:42.080 --> 2:27:50.320]  or afford it with new legislation and the criminals that stole the money and actually
[2:27:50.320 --> 2:27:57.360]  the guys that owned Landspunky, the Isave host have been openly, you know, associated with
[2:27:57.360 --> 2:28:03.840]  Russian mafia. So we're dealing with very big elements here. And that is why I think that
[2:28:05.600 --> 2:28:10.560]  the people in Iceland needs more than anything to feel that we're not alone in the world, that
[2:28:10.560 --> 2:28:17.040]  the people of the world more than anything are behind us. And I'm studying an international
[2:28:17.040 --> 2:28:22.800]  petition where the only thing people need to do is just to say that they support us in this quest
[2:28:22.800 --> 2:28:28.960]  for freedom from this tyranny and blackmail. And they've also been using the EU because what the
[2:28:28.960 --> 2:28:35.360]  new government did was to apply for membership of the European Union, despite the fact that
[2:28:35.360 --> 2:28:41.600]  majority of the nation is not willing to join it. And one people have to bear in mind that even
[2:28:41.600 --> 2:28:47.120]  though we're very few, there are 320,000 people living on the island, who is the island is the
[2:28:47.120 --> 2:28:57.840]  same size as Kentucky. We have incredible resources. And we are located very strategically for warfare.
[2:28:57.840 --> 2:29:02.080]  And that's why we had an American base here for, you know, since the World War, Second World War
[2:29:02.080 --> 2:29:10.080]  until recently. And since the Cold War stopped, then we became redundant as a location to the
[2:29:10.080 --> 2:29:18.560]  great joy of many. But however, the North pathway for ships to travel from Asia to this part of
[2:29:18.560 --> 2:29:26.720]  the world in a much shorter and quicker way is opening. So. All right, stay there. Stay there.
[2:29:26.720 --> 2:29:32.480]  Member of Parliament from Iceland leading the fight against the bankers, a bellwether test
[2:29:32.480 --> 2:29:37.040]  case. They're set to vote very soon on whether they're going to let the bankers continue their
[2:29:37.040 --> 2:29:41.200]  raping. The bankers are now cornered in the London Guardian reports. They're now saying,
[2:29:41.200 --> 2:29:46.640]  oh, guess what? You don't owe as much money as we said. The bank has all these assets.
[2:29:47.200 --> 2:29:50.880]  We're going to talk about that when we come back. Iceland is standing up.
[2:29:50.880 --> 2:29:58.160]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[2:31:05.760 --> 2:31:10.480]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[2:31:10.480 --> 2:31:16.160]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I've turned an endless influence
[2:31:16.160 --> 2:31:22.160]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all
[2:31:22.160 --> 2:31:28.160]  of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our
[2:31:28.160 --> 2:31:34.640]  nation. The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[2:31:34.640 --> 2:31:39.520]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and
[2:31:39.520 --> 2:31:44.080]  the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care.
[2:31:44.080 --> 2:31:50.480]  And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the republic. Get your copy of Full

[2:35:23.520 --> 2:35:36.000]  this Wednesday, the 13th day of January 2010 is 1-800-259-9231 and joining us via video Skype
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:41.840]  from the capital of Iceland is the member of parliament and the chairman of her party that is
[2:35:41.840 --> 2:35:46.160]  really getting more and more seats and more and more popularity as the people stand up and find
[2:35:46.160 --> 2:35:53.040]  their legs against the bankers. Birgitta Jones-Dottier again is our guest. As we went to break,
[2:35:53.040 --> 2:35:58.560]  I was asking the question for people that just joined us, now that it looks like Iceland's
[2:35:58.560 --> 2:36:02.000]  going to vote against paying this fraudulent debt to the bankers that have already robbed you,
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:07.760]  they just want more now, now they go, oh, suddenly we found all these assets in the bank,
[2:36:07.760 --> 2:36:12.000]  looks like you don't owe us even though it's fraudulent, owe us as much as we thought.
[2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:17.120]  So now they're backing off going, okay, we won't destroy you, we won't embargo you,
[2:36:17.120 --> 2:36:21.520]  we won't put blockades up, we won't destroy your nation after we already robbed it,
[2:36:21.520 --> 2:36:27.520]  if you just pay us a third of what we wanted. So again, we're showing that these guys are paper
[2:36:27.520 --> 2:36:32.720]  tigers, straw man, if you'll just stand up and fight them and leading that fight, we are so
[2:36:32.720 --> 2:36:37.680]  honored to have you and we salute you because we're all in this fight together, please continue.
[2:36:39.120 --> 2:36:43.440]  Okay, I just want to clarify one thing, that the people that are really leading this fight are
[2:36:43.440 --> 2:36:49.760]  the people of Iceland. Yes. Yeah, but I mean, you come up and all the major newspapers around
[2:36:49.760 --> 2:36:59.680]  the world and of anybody, you really are the figurehead and a quite well-spoken one as well.
[2:37:01.360 --> 2:37:04.080]  So I mean, it's your face, they're on the front of the ship.
[2:37:05.760 --> 2:37:10.800]  Well, in some respects, but however, it's been a lot of people working on this and so I don't
[2:37:10.800 --> 2:37:17.680]  want to take all the credit for it. One thing that we should also bear in mind when it comes to the
[2:37:17.680 --> 2:37:23.600]  Icelandic Sahara, the ISA Sahara and the entire collapse is that I actually, I met with John
[2:37:23.600 --> 2:37:31.040]  Perkins last year just before I got elected into parliament and I asked him, you know, what should
[2:37:31.040 --> 2:37:40.720]  we do to get rid of the IMF? And he told me that he was the most important thing we could do and I
[2:37:40.720 --> 2:37:46.240]  think the same applies to you in the States and all over the world is that you are the creator of
[2:37:46.240 --> 2:37:52.640]  your reality. And if you want changes, you are going to have to do something. Okay. And, you know,
[2:37:53.280 --> 2:37:58.720]  obviously, we were hit by an economic hitman. I don't know who it is or if there were many,
[2:37:58.720 --> 2:38:03.440]  but it is blatantly obvious. And it was very interesting how Iceland, when we were actually
[2:38:03.440 --> 2:38:09.840]  doing really well, they decided to go into the biggest construction, constructing a huge dam
[2:38:09.840 --> 2:38:17.040]  in order to give Alkoa dirt cheap energy that nobody knows the price of. And that's one of the
[2:38:17.040 --> 2:38:23.840]  battles is just to find out how cheap they're getting the energy. And the policy of the government
[2:38:23.840 --> 2:38:29.440]  that was previously and the government that was previous to that was basically to sell
[2:38:29.440 --> 2:38:36.480]  Iceland's energy dirt cheap. They were basically pimping Iceland. If you were reading, if you would
[2:38:36.480 --> 2:38:42.800]  read some of the proposals on getting all the aluminum smelters into Iceland, which is, by the
[2:38:42.800 --> 2:38:53.520]  way, one of the last pristine nature in Europe, you would be shocked. So there are many aspects
[2:38:53.520 --> 2:39:01.600]  to this. And we're just in the beginning of understanding how deep it goes. And it will
[2:39:01.600 --> 2:39:10.960]  be very interesting to see who are the corrupt people and if the nation has the guts to have
[2:39:10.960 --> 2:39:18.080]  them punished in one way or another for how they have sold out our country. And the interesting
[2:39:18.080 --> 2:39:24.480]  thing as well is that when the British decided to use the terrorist act on Iceland, very similar to
[2:39:24.480 --> 2:39:30.560]  how the Chinese took over Tibet. The Tibetans didn't have any army. They had a few people with guns
[2:39:30.560 --> 2:39:37.040]  that were haptors. Icelanders don't have any army or military and our cops don't even carry guns.
[2:39:37.040 --> 2:39:43.200]  So, you know, it's probably the least threatening nation in the world to being passed on side by
[2:39:43.200 --> 2:39:51.280]  side to Al-Qaeda and and the same pathway and North Korea. So, but the thing, the lesson to be
[2:39:51.280 --> 2:39:57.600]  learned for the rest of the people in the world is that we are the first one to be hit. You could
[2:39:57.600 --> 2:40:10.080]  be next. Absolutely. The establishment is now moving on to gobbling up first world nations.
[2:40:10.080 --> 2:40:16.880]  They they're doing the same process here. And so this key vote coming up, I mean,
[2:40:16.880 --> 2:40:22.000]  is Iceland going to be able to not just stop the bankers from robbing you but actually arrest some
[2:40:22.000 --> 2:40:27.200]  of these criminals or at least put arrest warrants out for them and signify that they are the
[2:40:27.200 --> 2:40:33.200]  criminals. They are the bad guys. I mean, that will destroy them in the PR war if they're rightfully
[2:40:33.200 --> 2:40:38.880]  indicted for fraud. Yeah, like some of them actually still hold the media, the main media,
[2:40:38.880 --> 2:40:44.640]  and they're still allowed to own it. It's unbelievable. But I think that we will have another,
[2:40:44.640 --> 2:40:50.880]  I mean, there is a huge wave of anger brewing again among the nation. And if the president would not
[2:40:50.880 --> 2:40:58.960]  have allowed us to give us this responsibility of voting on this particular bill, there would have
[2:40:58.960 --> 2:41:04.160]  been another revolution. And this time I fear it would have been more violent. The other one was
[2:41:04.160 --> 2:41:12.160]  relatively soft. But if the bankers and the people that are responsible for where we are at now
[2:41:12.160 --> 2:41:19.600]  are not going to get punished and put into jail, or, you know, I would like to see them expelled
[2:41:19.600 --> 2:41:27.040]  from Iceland forever and ever, then we will have another revolution on our hands.
[2:41:28.320 --> 2:41:35.120]  Well, I mean, what do you call people in thousands of demonstrations, hundreds, every day taking
[2:41:35.120 --> 2:41:39.920]  over government buildings, protesting on the streets, saying no, no, no. I've seen polls in
[2:41:39.920 --> 2:41:46.720]  Iceland where the vast majority are upset and saying they're not going to be part of it.
[2:41:46.720 --> 2:41:52.960]  Can you give us some of those numbers? Well, when we started protesting, you know,
[2:41:53.840 --> 2:41:58.720]  I come from that sort of grassroots level where I've organized protests and been part of protests
[2:41:58.720 --> 2:42:03.920]  for a long time in Iceland. We were just a handful of us in the beginning. There were actually more
[2:42:03.920 --> 2:42:10.960]  foreign media than us. However, it gradually grew into thousands of people. And because
[2:42:10.960 --> 2:42:16.320]  the numbers you would get in the Icelandic media would be always according to what the police
[2:42:16.320 --> 2:42:22.320]  estimated, because the media couldn't bother to go and count it, we only got accurate numbers when
[2:42:22.320 --> 2:42:27.680]  the foreign media came and counted the protesters. And it was thousands and thousands of people and
[2:42:27.680 --> 2:42:37.760]  some of the big protests. And then when we had the, you know, the soft revolution that in the end
[2:42:37.760 --> 2:42:46.560]  drove the government away. I don't know, there were people protesting day and night and it was
[2:42:46.560 --> 2:42:51.680]  in the middle of winter here. It was really cold. I had a friend that got ammonia from
[2:42:51.680 --> 2:42:58.240]  standing outside and they were doing this. They, you know, they got all these drummers and all
[2:42:58.240 --> 2:43:02.240]  these people that were banging on pots and pans and it was sort of similar to the revolution
[2:43:02.240 --> 2:43:06.960]  in Argentina. The pots and pans revolution and that is what it was called in Iceland.
[2:43:06.960 --> 2:43:15.840]  It was extremely noisy. And it was driving the people in the parliament crazy. So maybe it
[2:43:15.840 --> 2:43:21.280]  was the noise that got them to resign. I don't know. But it was getting quite violent. They took,
[2:43:21.280 --> 2:43:26.160]  it was a huge Christmas tree outside parliament that the Norwegians always give us every Christmas.
[2:43:26.720 --> 2:43:32.080]  And they took that and burned it down. And this sort of protest had not been happening in Iceland
[2:43:32.080 --> 2:43:37.680]  since we joined NATO because- Yeah, when the people started burning stuff down, the government
[2:43:37.680 --> 2:43:45.600]  started backing off. Yes, absolutely. And also the police was attacked and they actually didn't
[2:43:45.600 --> 2:43:50.960]  have enough mace. They were running out of mace. So they started to use tear gas. And the moral is
[2:43:50.960 --> 2:43:55.520]  when people actually finally get mad and take action, nothing, no amount of SWAT teams,
[2:43:55.520 --> 2:44:01.440]  no amount of garbage can stop them. And people always forget in revolution the power of fire.
[2:44:01.440 --> 2:44:07.600]  And I'm not saying that's something that needs to go on here, but I mean, look, a true revolutionary
[2:44:07.600 --> 2:44:11.840]  force cannot be stopped when it's got right on its side. And so now they're backing off.
[2:44:12.480 --> 2:44:17.760]  Also, people took over some buildings too, didn't they? Well, they did not take over the parliament
[2:44:17.760 --> 2:44:23.040]  or anything, but they did get into the national treasury, but they didn't take it over. They
[2:44:23.040 --> 2:44:29.280]  were just inside. Yes, they were just inside. And I guess the media spun it and called it a takeover.
[2:44:29.280 --> 2:44:34.080]  Just like for months, they wouldn't even show your protest or they'd show the corner of a small
[2:44:34.080 --> 2:44:38.160]  group and say, these five people are out here. And then if they would have panned the camera,
[2:44:38.160 --> 2:44:43.440]  which YouTube showed tens of thousands, that's how they minimize that. We've had events here in
[2:44:43.440 --> 2:44:48.800]  Austin with two, three thousand people. The news will come shoot the back of the crowd or a corner
[2:44:48.800 --> 2:44:54.640]  and only show five or six people. Yeah, that's so typical. And I've actually, you know, been following
[2:44:54.640 --> 2:45:01.440]  what's going on in the States and seeing that, you know, the news that are not really broadcasted
[2:45:01.440 --> 2:45:08.640]  in the main media. And it's an entirely different situation. I mean, there are pretty grim things
[2:45:08.640 --> 2:45:13.760]  happening in the States right now. And exactly. And they're trying to make the opposition right
[2:45:13.760 --> 2:45:19.120]  wing controlled by Glenn Beck and the Republicans so that they can get back into power and continue
[2:45:19.120 --> 2:45:25.040]  the fraud is like Obama continued the fraud. But the truth is the tea parties are really libertarian
[2:45:25.040 --> 2:45:30.400]  and grassroots. Yeah, I've been actually following them because we're also working on this level
[2:45:30.400 --> 2:45:35.280]  that we think left and right is redundant and that what we really need to focus on are the issues
[2:45:36.080 --> 2:45:42.640]  and our causes. And our moment, for example, does not define itself as left or right.
[2:45:42.640 --> 2:45:48.720]  Our main objective is to bring more power to the people or the power that they rightfully own
[2:45:48.720 --> 2:45:52.800]  back to them. So what's going to happen? What's going to happen? I mean, I know you can't tell
[2:45:52.800 --> 2:45:57.680]  the future, but right now the banks are starting to back off and saying, OK, you don't owe us as
[2:45:57.680 --> 2:46:03.760]  much money. I mean, they should go to jail much less not. Well, I think it's not really in the
[2:46:03.760 --> 2:46:09.200]  hands of the bank banks anymore. It is in the hands of the British and the Dutch and the Icelandic
[2:46:09.200 --> 2:46:15.120]  governments. And that is the big problem. It is being driven through the financial ministries of
[2:46:15.120 --> 2:46:21.200]  these countries. Instead of taking it as what it is, it is a foreign affairs issue. Well,
[2:46:21.200 --> 2:46:27.040]  why can't your parliament march in and take over the treasury? There's nothing in the treasury.
[2:46:27.040 --> 2:46:31.440]  No, but I'm saying not let. I mean, you're saying the bureaucracy is still making the
[2:46:31.440 --> 2:46:35.360]  decisions. But you're the boss. You're the people's representative. I mean,
[2:46:35.360 --> 2:46:42.320]  well, the thing is, you know, the the petition and the fact that we get to vote on it, I really
[2:46:42.320 --> 2:46:47.280]  hope that they will not take that away from us. They can take the voting from us by pulling back
[2:46:47.280 --> 2:46:53.600]  the bill. But I really think it is extremely important that we have this national referendum
[2:46:53.600 --> 2:47:01.520]  because it will set an example for that the people can again call for national referendum
[2:47:01.520 --> 2:47:05.840]  if a certain percentage of the nation calls for it. And that's coming up soon.
[2:47:07.040 --> 2:47:15.120]  Yes, it's it's set for around 27th of February. So we'll see what happens in the meantime. I'm
[2:47:15.120 --> 2:47:21.600]  part of since I'm acting chairman right now for the moment, I get to go to all the hands of state
[2:47:21.600 --> 2:47:28.960]  meetings and so forth. And we're trying to form a sort of joint approach to this, which I think
[2:47:28.960 --> 2:47:35.760]  is very important that the politicians who are supposed to be representing the nation come out
[2:47:35.760 --> 2:47:44.800]  with a strong message that we, you know, are not going to take this as it is today, because I feel
[2:47:44.800 --> 2:47:50.000]  it is more than anything a blackmail, especially, you know, because the British in the Dutch have
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:57.520]  also been saying that if we don't do what they say, our application to the EU is not going to happen.
[2:47:57.520 --> 2:48:01.920]  And why would you want to be part of the EU and go under all their taxes and control?
[2:48:02.560 --> 2:48:08.560]  Well, I don't I don't want to do it, especially because I'm in the committee that deals with
[2:48:08.560 --> 2:48:12.560]  the application and I've seen what sort of thing the European Union is.
[2:48:13.440 --> 2:48:18.400]  Tell us what the European Union as a member of parliament seeing the application. Tell folks
[2:48:18.400 --> 2:48:22.480]  what it does. I mean, that's like saying, give us all your power or we won't beat you in the head
[2:48:22.480 --> 2:48:26.160]  with a hammer. Don't you want to be beaten the head with a hammer? We're going to take away you
[2:48:26.160 --> 2:48:30.320]  being beaten the head with a hammer. If you don't do what we say, you know, I mean, I mean,
[2:48:30.320 --> 2:48:34.960]  it's ridiculous. It's like, if you don't do what we say, we're not going to make you eat 20 pounds
[2:48:34.960 --> 2:48:44.560]  of rotten meat. Well, it's a very strange organization, which is probably the heaven of
[2:48:44.560 --> 2:48:52.880]  bureaucrats and the heaven of bureaucrats. Yes. Yes. So, but the social democrats who are the
[2:48:52.880 --> 2:48:57.360]  biggest party now, they have been it's been their dream for a long time to join the European Union.
[2:48:57.360 --> 2:49:02.000]  So, they put in the application and they had sold the nation. That was another con.
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:08.000]  They sold the nation that, oh, in order for us to see, you know, what the European Union has to
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:14.480]  offer to us, we have to apply. But they did not tell us that they actually is an integration
[2:49:14.480 --> 2:49:20.960]  process. And in the meanwhile, you know, while we're really suffering from this financial collapse,
[2:49:20.960 --> 2:49:25.440]  we're spending so much money on this particular application, whereas you could get all the
[2:49:25.440 --> 2:49:33.040]  information about the deal without applying. Amazing. Absolutely. I mean, the EU is completely
[2:49:33.040 --> 2:49:37.920]  undemocratic. The bureaucrats will take you over. If you started saying you agreed with them and
[2:49:37.920 --> 2:49:44.080]  if you voted for it, you'd suddenly have some $500,000, $300,000 lavish job in Brussels.
[2:49:45.040 --> 2:49:49.040]  They're exempt from most of the taxes they levy on the countries. I mean, you, I mean,
[2:49:49.040 --> 2:49:54.640]  that's the mark of corruption is when the government is exempt from the laws the people are under.
[2:49:55.360 --> 2:50:02.000]  Yeah. I totally agree. I don't think, you know, in any way, if, you know, I were for the EU,
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:07.600]  this is not the right time to go and apply for membership because, you know, we're on our knees
[2:50:07.600 --> 2:50:13.840]  and that is not a good space to negotiate at all for a good deal. But if the banks still take over
[2:50:13.840 --> 2:50:19.440]  and loot you guys, the public's going to rise up again. Certainly your populations learn the
[2:50:19.440 --> 2:50:26.480]  lesson that standing up to the answer. Absolutely. And I really, really hope that by, you know, if
[2:50:26.480 --> 2:50:31.840]  we can get support from people from around the world who are fed up with the same sort of,
[2:50:32.960 --> 2:50:37.120]  you know, responsibilities they're given by the bankers, but basically, you know,
[2:50:37.760 --> 2:50:42.720]  they're basically a race in the middle class. That's what they're doing. Every time you get a
[2:50:42.720 --> 2:50:47.440]  house, you own a house, you have savings, they suck it up when their bubble's burst. So we need to
[2:50:47.440 --> 2:50:52.880]  do this together. We do, we're doing it together. Final segment coming up, we may twist your arm to
[2:50:52.880 --> 2:50:57.680]  five more minutes after that so we can take calls. Scott, Fred, Alex, Rick stay there.

[2:52:09.520 --> 2:52:14.240]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at
[2:52:14.240 --> 2:52:20.800]  home and have tremendous influence on our president in Congress. And they really are calling the shots.
[2:52:20.800 --> 2:52:27.040]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic
[2:52:27.040 --> 2:52:33.680]  identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[2:52:33.680 --> 2:52:38.640]  and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, the arsonists, they're
[2:52:38.640 --> 2:52:42.480]  asking for more matches. And the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[2:52:42.480 --> 2:52:48.800]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the

[2:54:24.480 --> 2:54:30.000]  Yeah, sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.
[2:54:37.200 --> 2:54:38.400]  That's what the bankers are.
[2:54:44.000 --> 2:54:49.600]  Brigitte Jones-Dottier, chairman of her party in Iceland, a member of parliament. She's with us
[2:54:49.600 --> 2:54:56.240]  for another five minutes in the next hour. Then we are joined by Katherine Austin Fitz. You do not
[2:54:56.240 --> 2:55:02.320]  want to miss that on Bankergate. This is the big issue that affects everybody. And she was assistant
[2:55:02.320 --> 2:55:06.800]  secretary of housing and federal housing commissioner in the first Bush administration.
[2:55:06.800 --> 2:55:11.840]  Always powerful interview. That's coming up. But right now let's go to your phone calls for our
[2:55:11.840 --> 2:55:19.760]  guests. Scott, you're on the air from Texas with our guests. Go ahead, Scott. Hi, Brigitte. Back during
[2:55:19.760 --> 2:55:27.920]  the banking crisis when it hit the news here, Ron Paul was interviewed and asked his opinion of what
[2:55:27.920 --> 2:55:36.240]  we should do. And of course, he said, let the banks fail. And then they asked Dr. Paul, well,
[2:55:36.240 --> 2:55:43.680]  what does Congress think we should do? And Dr. Paul said Congress doesn't have a clue. Or do you
[2:55:43.680 --> 2:55:49.040]  have the same frustration in Iceland that would you say it's the same level that Dr. Paul has here
[2:55:49.040 --> 2:55:56.160]  of the ignorance, just plain old ignorance that exists in the body of lawmakers?
[2:55:58.400 --> 2:56:05.520]  Absolutely. Thank you for this question. I think it has actually been quite shocking to see the
[2:56:05.520 --> 2:56:12.000]  level of ignorance and lack of being able to see the whole picture. And I remember I went to parliament
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:19.120]  when the past the emergency law, I was just an ordinary citizen back then. And I was looking
[2:56:19.120 --> 2:56:24.320]  at the members of parliament and they all looked like five-year-old children feeling really embarrassed
[2:56:24.320 --> 2:56:29.440]  about the situation. It did not make me feel very comfortable. And then the expert bankers from the
[2:56:29.440 --> 2:56:34.560]  Treasury prance in and use a bunch of fancy language and tell them what to do. It's time to
[2:56:34.560 --> 2:56:41.360]  arrest these people. Absolutely. One good thing about this entire economical collapse in Iceland,
[2:56:41.360 --> 2:56:45.760]  I don't know how it is in the States, is that people have actually educated themselves a lot
[2:56:45.760 --> 2:56:51.520]  about what real economy is. Yes, it is waking people up. That's been the goodbye product. Yes.
[2:56:52.240 --> 2:56:59.600]  So I have a tendency to try to look into what can we learn from it and are there any positive
[2:56:59.600 --> 2:57:05.040]  elements in the situation? And I think there is a lot of good positive elements in this.
[2:57:05.680 --> 2:57:11.200]  For me, it is a dream come true to see the Icelandic wake up to realize that they can actually
[2:57:12.560 --> 2:57:17.040]  be the change makers in their own world. Yes, real change, not fake Obama change.
[2:57:17.040 --> 2:57:21.360]  Thank you, Scott. Good question. Fred in Ohio, your question to the lawmaker from Iceland.
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:28.560]  Yes, my question to your guest, Alex, is how can we, the American people, support your fight in
[2:57:28.560 --> 2:57:36.000]  your fight for sovereignty and what surprise might be needed? Well, I'd say this, email their media,
[2:57:36.800 --> 2:57:42.720]  letters to the editor, call people you know in Iceland, spread the news, the articles that our
[2:57:42.720 --> 2:57:47.680]  guest, Jones Dotier writes. What else can they do to support your fight against the New World Order?
[2:57:49.280 --> 2:57:55.920]  We're setting up a site that is going to be open about a week called when I'm just reading out
[2:57:55.920 --> 2:58:01.520]  the site address. It's not ready yet. It's going to be probably something on it tomorrow. It's
[2:58:01.520 --> 2:58:08.720]  savethepeopleofisland.com. And I think more than anything, the Icelandic people need to feel that
[2:58:08.720 --> 2:58:14.160]  they are supported by you guys who are listening to this and who have been reading mine. Yes,
[2:58:14.160 --> 2:58:21.920]  savethepeopleofisland.com. Save the people of Iceland.com. What great questions. Anything else,
[2:58:21.920 --> 2:58:27.040]  friend? No, that's it. Thank you. We're going to come back and talk to Alex and Rick and a few
[2:58:27.040 --> 2:58:33.520]  others. One minute break, final five minutes with Bergita Jones Dotier. I'm Alex Jones.
[2:58:33.520 --> 2:58:39.600]  Worldwide, the people rising against the International Banking Crime Syndicate. We must prevail.
[2:58:42.960 --> 2:58:48.720]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:48.720 --> 2:58:56.080]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle
[2:58:56.080 --> 2:59:01.280]  and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I
[2:59:01.280 --> 2:59:06.960]  can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[2:59:06.960 --> 2:59:12.240]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[2:59:12.240 --> 2:59:16.880]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[2:59:16.880 --> 2:59:21.440]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[2:59:21.440 --> 2:59:26.160]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:59:26.160 --> 2:59:31.600]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't
[2:59:31.600 --> 2:59:36.960]  know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live
[2:59:36.960 --> 2:59:45.760]  to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:59:45.760 --> 2:59:49.760]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[2:59:54.000 --> 2:59:59.200]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[3:00:08.720 --> 3:00:11.040]  Here we are, already into hour number four.
[3:00:11.040 --> 3:00:18.720]  Catherine Austin Fitz coming up at T-minus seven minutes. Let's go right back to the calls for
[3:00:18.720 --> 3:00:23.520]  our guest, member of Iceland's parliament, the real leadership, the chairman of her party
[3:00:23.520 --> 3:00:27.360]  against the banker takeover. They've got a good chance of beating them. The bankers are already
[3:00:27.360 --> 3:00:31.440]  starting to fold and saying, okay, you don't have to be total slaves. We'll let you keep
[3:00:31.440 --> 3:00:38.960]  a couple of Icelandic dollars. Let's go to Alex in Georgia. You're on the air with our guest,
[3:00:38.960 --> 3:00:46.400]  Birgitta Jones. Go ahead. Hey, Birgitta, I had a question. It might be a little redundant
[3:00:46.400 --> 3:00:51.760]  from the last caller, but you mentioned something about an international online petition. Is
[3:00:51.760 --> 3:00:58.240]  that still in the works or is that something that could be at the website? Yes, I'm actually
[3:00:58.240 --> 3:01:04.160]  putting it together and I haven't had time to finish it off today, but it is going to be on this
[3:01:04.160 --> 3:01:10.800]  website, savethepeopleofisland.com. And I guess the only thing that we're asking is that people
[3:01:10.800 --> 3:01:16.880]  just put their name there that they support us in this battle. Well, Iceland is the very front line
[3:01:16.880 --> 3:01:22.240]  of the bankers trying to rape and rob the first world. We've got to stop them there and we've
[3:01:22.240 --> 3:01:28.400]  got a good chance. Anything else, Alex? No, that's just wondering where I can help out and support
[3:01:28.400 --> 3:01:34.640]  the cause and get for it. Thank you for caring. Birgitta, what else can we do to help Iceland?
[3:01:35.760 --> 3:01:45.840]  Just spread the word and if you happen to stumble across any information that might help us get
[3:01:45.840 --> 3:01:56.160]  the IMF out of Iceland, use services like WikiLeaks because we feel that this is a much bigger problem
[3:01:56.160 --> 3:02:05.840]  than just Iceland's problem. Like they said, experts in the European law have said that it is
[3:02:05.840 --> 3:02:10.480]  actually a question if we have any legal responsibility in it. It is a big legal question.
[3:02:12.160 --> 3:02:17.520]  You don't. You have bankers that engage in fraud. The instruments sold to them by Goldman Sachs
[3:02:17.520 --> 3:02:21.600]  and others in the Bank of England are fraud. They're using anti-terror laws to try to grab
[3:02:21.600 --> 3:02:27.120]  people's accounts. They're threatening embargoes against your nation. This is terrorism. This is
[3:02:27.120 --> 3:02:35.200]  blackmail that must be defeated. We can't let them devour your nation. Absolutely true. And like I
[3:02:35.200 --> 3:02:41.840]  said, this might just be the beginning. We might be the first world country to suffer from this
[3:02:41.840 --> 3:02:47.280]  sort of attack. Well, we see Greece saying no. We see other nations saying no. We identify these
[3:02:47.280 --> 3:02:53.440]  frauds for what they are and let the banks fail. The people don't owe this debt. Thank you so much,
[3:02:53.440 --> 3:02:59.840]  Alex. Rick in California, you're on the air. Go ahead. Yeah, thanks, Alex, for taking that call.
[3:02:59.840 --> 3:03:03.840]  Real quick, I see a lot on the media. I watch a lot. I listen to you guys. I listen to a lot of
[3:03:03.840 --> 3:03:07.840]  other news sources. The key thing I just was curious about is that you have a lot of these
[3:03:07.840 --> 3:03:12.720]  people now that are pushing for credit unions as like the new way to kind of help the economy or
[3:03:12.720 --> 3:03:18.000]  help defeat the banks in some way. She performed a putting a run on the major banks. But isn't
[3:03:18.000 --> 3:03:23.600]  that kind of like the dog, you know, wagging the tail wagging the dog type scenario? Well,
[3:03:23.600 --> 3:03:28.080]  whatever you can do to decentralize to get out of the big banks to support local,
[3:03:28.080 --> 3:03:33.200]  it's all part of a process of learning and awakening to these parasites. Birgita.
[3:03:33.920 --> 3:03:36.720]  Yeah, I totally agree. Actually, one of the first things that I did
[3:03:36.720 --> 3:03:43.120]  during the collapse of the banks was to see if there were any banks in Iceland that had not
[3:03:43.120 --> 3:03:51.600]  been, you know, overinvesting or, you know, part of this big scam. And there are actually two banks
[3:03:51.600 --> 3:03:56.400]  that are found in Iceland and they're in the countryside. So I moved, I actually didn't have
[3:03:56.400 --> 3:04:01.920]  much money. So I moved the little money I had and all my transactions owe to there. And I encourage
[3:04:01.920 --> 3:04:07.600]  people not to participate in the big back scams. I mean, the only way to change anything is to
[3:04:07.600 --> 3:04:14.240]  change your own ways. Absolutely. And I'm trying to do that as well. We have an operation that's
[3:04:14.240 --> 3:04:18.240]  international. So we do have some money in several big banks, but we're trying to move it into smaller
[3:04:18.240 --> 3:04:22.960]  smaller banks. But that's a great idea. Thank you so much, Rick. I wish we'd go to Randy and
[3:04:22.960 --> 3:04:28.400]  others, but we can't. We could talk to Catherine Austin Fitz coming up if you'd like. Birgita Jones
[3:04:28.400 --> 3:04:33.760]  Daughtier, member of the Icelandic parliament will certainly have you back up as things unfold in
[3:04:33.760 --> 3:04:40.080]  this key battleground sector that you're in. And we thank God that great people like yourself have
[3:04:40.880 --> 3:04:47.120]  have been risen up to the fore in this key juncture in human society. So we appreciate your fight for
[3:04:47.120 --> 3:04:52.720]  liberty and justice and the truth. And we are with the people of Iceland against this tyranny.
[3:04:52.720 --> 3:05:00.160]  God bless you. I bless you. Thank you. We'll talk to you again soon. We'll be right back. Take care.

[3:07:02.480 --> 3:07:07.440]  Hi, neighbor. They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Certainly, we'd never
[3:07:07.440 --> 3:07:11.920]  intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left at any price.
[3:07:11.920 --> 3:07:16.160]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable
[3:07:16.160 --> 3:07:21.200]  to care for themselves. We would intend not to be standing in the bread line with the ignorant and
[3:07:21.200 --> 3:07:26.320]  the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue. If the experience of
[3:07:26.320 --> 3:07:32.320]  the Katrina disaster is evidence, the bread line may have no bread. Just like the good intentions
[3:07:32.320 --> 3:07:37.280]  on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will
[3:07:37.280 --> 3:07:42.800]  not feed us. Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the
[3:07:42.800 --> 3:07:56.240]  future. Call 800-409-5633. 800-409-5633 on the web, efoodsdirect.com. Who am I? Some of who cares.
[3:07:56.240 --> 3:08:13.440]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[3:08:14.080 --> 3:08:22.400]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:08:22.400 --> 3:08:29.280]  Solari.com is her website. Our websites are infowars.com and prismplenit.com. She's Catherine
[3:08:29.280 --> 3:08:36.560]  Austin Fitz. I was talking to Birgitta Jones-Dottier leading the charge to beat the banks in Iceland,
[3:08:36.560 --> 3:08:41.920]  not tooting my horn. An example of what you the activists have done. A few months ago,
[3:08:41.920 --> 3:08:46.000]  she got a copy of the Obama deception and she already knew a lot, but that helped,
[3:08:46.000 --> 3:08:50.640]  you know, give her even more info. And so another example of how the Obama deception
[3:08:50.640 --> 3:08:56.000]  fall the Republic, the type of effect these films are having all over the world. Every
[3:08:56.000 --> 3:08:59.840]  few days I get newspapers calling up saying, these films have been seen tens of millions of
[3:08:59.840 --> 3:09:04.880]  times for free online. How much money are you making on those free views? And I say nothing.
[3:09:05.680 --> 3:09:12.000]  I don't want money. I want freedom. I see every person we wake up like a diamond in my hand.
[3:09:12.000 --> 3:09:18.240]  I'm into defeating tyranny. I mean, again, it's a hierarchy of needs. I own stuff,
[3:09:18.240 --> 3:09:23.200]  but stuff doesn't own me. I'm into truth and justice and liberty. I know that's not corny.
[3:09:23.200 --> 3:09:28.320]  I know that's real. I want my children to live in a free society. My son and my daughters.
[3:09:28.320 --> 3:09:31.920]  I want my grandchildren who aren't even born yet to live in a free society.
[3:09:32.800 --> 3:09:37.840]  They won't even be able to have children under the one child policy. Give the globalist are
[3:09:37.840 --> 3:09:45.200]  successful. Now, Catherine Austin Fitz has an amazing bio. She has managed more than 25
[3:09:45.200 --> 3:09:50.480]  billion of transactions and invested today in his letter portfolio strategy for 300 billion of
[3:09:50.480 --> 3:09:56.480]  financial assets and liabilities. She was also the number two person at the department of housing,
[3:09:56.480 --> 3:10:03.280]  assistant secretary of housing and the commissioner of the first Bush administration.
[3:10:03.280 --> 3:10:07.760]  And it just goes on and on and on the things that she's done again, assistant secretary of housing,
[3:10:07.760 --> 3:10:12.480]  federal housing commissioner in the first Bush administration of president, Hamilton securities
[3:10:12.480 --> 3:10:18.080]  group, Washington DC investment banks, super high powered lady in the system coming out and
[3:10:18.080 --> 3:10:23.840]  exposing it. And she's talked about the crimes committed by Geithner and other people. And you
[3:10:23.840 --> 3:10:31.040]  have Geithner at the New York Fed that runs policy for the Fed. You have Paulson at the time at
[3:10:31.040 --> 3:10:36.080]  treasury, the former head of Goldman Sachs, Geithner formerly of Goldman Sachs, giving themselves
[3:10:36.080 --> 3:10:43.040]  a hundred cents on the dollar for made up derivatives they made that the public had no, you know,
[3:10:43.040 --> 3:10:48.800]  contractual agreement to pay for to them. You have them also ordering AIG to make it secret.
[3:10:48.800 --> 3:10:53.360]  And now that's continued on. And that clearly, according to judge Napolitano and many others
[3:10:53.360 --> 3:10:57.680]  is a federal crime. But somebody who really understands this is Catherine Austin Fitz.
[3:10:57.680 --> 3:11:01.840]  So we're going to talk about Bankster gate or banker gate. I don't want to call it just Timmy
[3:11:01.840 --> 3:11:07.600]  Geithner gate, tiny Tim gate, because he's just one of these people. It goes to Larry Summers.
[3:11:07.600 --> 3:11:12.720]  It goes to Robert Rubin. It goes to Ben Bernanke. It goes to everybody that got rid of the Glass
[3:11:12.720 --> 3:11:18.000]  Stegal Act. So joining us is a true bonafide expert in all of this. Catherine Austin Fitz,
[3:11:18.000 --> 3:11:21.920]  great to have you on with us. It's always an absolute privilege and a pleasure.
[3:11:24.080 --> 3:11:27.440]  Well, you're busy. You know what I would love to tell everybody about
[3:11:27.440 --> 3:11:33.680]  is how important this Geithner story is. You know, it kind of seems like a big sort
[3:11:33.680 --> 3:11:38.720]  of inside baseball squabble, but I really want everyone to understand what's at the heart of
[3:11:38.720 --> 3:11:44.720]  this. Now, just and I want to use the metaphor, let's pretend you have a neighbor. And every
[3:11:44.720 --> 3:11:49.040]  time whenever you and your wife go to buy a car, you have to pay 5% to get a loan,
[3:11:49.040 --> 3:11:54.800]  but he can get a loan for zero or 1%. And then when you get a mortgage, you have to pay,
[3:11:54.800 --> 3:12:00.720]  you know, 8% to 10%, but he can get a mortgage for zero or 1%. And then when he starts a business,
[3:12:00.720 --> 3:12:06.400]  he can get special loans from the local municipality for 0%. And then you have to,
[3:12:06.400 --> 3:12:10.320]  you know, use your savings or borrow your money or take another loan on your house. Well,
[3:12:10.320 --> 3:12:13.920]  it doesn't take long to figure that he's going to, you know, if this keeps going on,
[3:12:13.920 --> 3:12:16.240]  he's going to be able to buy up everything in town, right?
[3:12:16.800 --> 3:12:17.280]  Yes.
[3:12:17.280 --> 3:12:23.040]  And that's what this is about is we've got two classes of players. We've got a Federal Reserve
[3:12:23.040 --> 3:12:30.240]  Bank that's saying we reserve the right to provide low cost, if not free, cost to capital and even
[3:12:30.240 --> 3:12:36.880]  now give, you know, so instead of him borrowing money at 1%, they just give him the money so he
[3:12:36.880 --> 3:12:42.560]  can buy the, you know, all the houses up in the neighborhood. And what we're talking is a backdoor
[3:12:42.560 --> 3:12:47.840]  financial mechanism that allows a small group of people to basically buy up and take control of
[3:12:47.840 --> 3:12:54.640]  everything because they have, you know, low cost to free money, whereas everybody else has to pay,
[3:12:54.640 --> 3:13:00.080]  you know, market rate, you know, or a much higher rate, number one. But number two,
[3:13:00.640 --> 3:13:05.440]  if let's say he gets in trouble, he gets bailed out, you get in trouble, you lose your house,
[3:13:05.440 --> 3:13:11.520]  you lose your car, you lose your family. And so we're talking about a society that is
[3:13:11.520 --> 3:13:18.400]  is turning into it, you know, two societies, two economies, and one is getting rigged money. And
[3:13:18.400 --> 3:13:23.680]  that's what this is about because if, if you've got a secretary of the Treasury who's basically
[3:13:23.680 --> 3:13:28.320]  trying to rig things, not for the people who are productive, not for the people who are making our
[3:13:28.320 --> 3:13:32.960]  economy strong, not for the people who are creating jobs, but the people who are the best dirty
[3:13:32.960 --> 3:13:39.360]  players, then, then, you know, it's for a financial person, this can go no place good. It can, it
[3:13:39.360 --> 3:13:44.880]  can never work because instead of allocating capital base to, you know, who's productive,
[3:13:44.880 --> 3:13:50.400]  we're allocating capital to who's the best dirty player with the most inside pull. You know, it's,
[3:13:50.400 --> 3:13:57.360]  it's kind of devolved into, you know, the schoolyard in, in Lord of the Rings or something. I mean,
[3:13:57.360 --> 3:14:03.840]  or in, in the, you know, in animal farm. It's the only, you know, this is the financial version
[3:14:03.840 --> 3:14:09.440]  of animal farm. And that's what this is about because we've seen, you know, since the, since
[3:14:09.440 --> 3:14:15.200]  the beginning of the republic till two years ago, in all the wars, Alex, in all the programs,
[3:14:15.200 --> 3:14:20.880]  in all the government ways, in all the government spending, we build up $12 trillion of debt.
[3:14:21.760 --> 3:14:27.920]  And then in, in a year and a half, this administration has lent or given as a
[3:14:27.920 --> 3:14:34.640]  gift, $12 trillion to Wall Street and the, and the financial firms. And, and that is,
[3:14:34.640 --> 3:14:39.360]  can you imagine that is amount equivalent to all the money we've ever borrowed since
[3:14:39.360 --> 3:14:45.840]  the beginning of the republic. It's incredible. It's a financial coup d'etat. And that's what
[3:14:45.840 --> 3:14:52.080]  it's about. And the, and the power of this thing is, are we going to create a level playing field
[3:14:52.080 --> 3:14:57.040]  or are we not? Cause if we're going to rig caught, if we've got a secretary, the treasury is going
[3:14:57.040 --> 3:15:03.360]  to rig the game, you know, invisible secretive ways. And one of the magical things here is,
[3:15:03.360 --> 3:15:08.320]  and I got to give him a lot of credit is, is Bloomberg has brought a lawsuit. They won in
[3:15:08.320 --> 3:15:14.080]  the first round in August for freedom of information act against the federal reserve,
[3:15:15.200 --> 3:15:20.720]  brought a lawsuit and, and won in the first round in August and the Fed has now appealed.
[3:15:20.720 --> 3:15:26.960]  It's in the court of appeals and the Fed is saying, we need the ability to lend an insider
[3:15:26.960 --> 3:15:33.360]  group of firms 12, I mean, $2 trillion, which is part of the 12 trillion and not tell you who
[3:15:33.360 --> 3:15:38.880]  got it and on what terms. And, and we don't have to provide that under freedom of information
[3:15:38.880 --> 3:15:44.400]  law. It's just, it's an arrogance, which takes your breath away. And they're setting the precedent
[3:15:44.400 --> 3:15:49.680]  to do even more in the future. And, and you talk about a rig game where they get the free money
[3:15:49.680 --> 3:15:55.360]  and now it's just given to them. They then use that money as weapons to buy off states, buy
[3:15:55.360 --> 3:16:00.560]  media, buy infrastructure, blow out third world countries, now blow out first world nations.
[3:16:01.120 --> 3:16:07.200]  And they have their people in both parties, as you know, in all the major regulatory positions.
[3:16:07.920 --> 3:16:13.680]  And I think that's why they're so arrogant now is they're going for broke. The big question is,
[3:16:13.680 --> 3:16:18.480]  and I want to get into how we can push to get Geithner indicted or a special prosecutor or
[3:16:18.480 --> 3:16:23.680]  something like that. But, but the big question is where are they headed? If we don't stop them,
[3:16:23.680 --> 3:16:28.720]  because they have the incentive to shut off money to Main Street, so it's destitute,
[3:16:28.720 --> 3:16:32.800]  so they can come in and buy it up for pennies on the dollar. Right. And that's what they're doing.
[3:16:32.800 --> 3:16:36.880]  I mean, the reports now, if you look at the commercial real estate market, and we haven't
[3:16:36.880 --> 3:16:41.840]  began to see all the falls in the, in the commercial real estate market, you know,
[3:16:41.840 --> 3:16:46.640]  they're talking about buying things that 50% or less of, you know, the market height. And this
[3:16:46.640 --> 3:16:51.680]  is what I saw as assistant secretary of housing. I came in as assistant secretary of housing in
[3:16:51.680 --> 3:16:57.440]  1989. And at the time, FHA was the largest property owner because of our foreclosures.
[3:16:57.440 --> 3:17:05.200]  And then the RTC got created to handle the dispositions of the SNL. And, and we started to
[3:17:05.200 --> 3:17:10.000]  auction off where our, my secretary was on the board of the RTC. And so I was involved.
[3:17:10.560 --> 3:17:15.680]  And, and we were taking in massive amounts of property and the fraud, Alex was off the
[3:17:15.680 --> 3:17:19.920]  charts, you know, you'd get a portfolio and says, there are 10 mortgages on this block in
[3:17:19.920 --> 3:17:24.640]  Detroit and you'd go there and there were no house there. You know, so the fraud was off the
[3:17:24.640 --> 3:17:29.440]  charts. But what happened is when the first bid came in, no one knew if the bids would work.
[3:17:30.160 --> 3:17:35.360]  And, and I looked at the first three bids and I said, Oh my God, the people buying this are
[3:17:35.360 --> 3:17:40.960]  buying at 10 cents on the dollar, what their syndicate sold two years ago for, you know, 200%
[3:17:41.520 --> 3:17:46.000]  of market value. So it was a pump and dump. And they were going to make, you know, they were going
[3:17:46.000 --> 3:17:53.360]  to triple quadruple the money they'd made selling out at the high. So, so this is a scam. And,
[3:17:53.360 --> 3:17:58.880]  and I think part of what may be different this time is you now have something you didn't have
[3:17:58.880 --> 3:18:04.000]  in 1989. You know, we didn't have the internet. We didn't have, you know, Alex Jones. We didn't
[3:18:04.000 --> 3:18:09.120]  have all these different ways of communicating and seeing how monstrous the game was.
[3:18:09.120 --> 3:18:14.080]  And the fraud is much bigger. Oh, the fraud is so much bigger because they played the game.
[3:18:14.080 --> 3:18:18.720]  You know, the black budget game happened in the real estate market and the mortgage market
[3:18:18.720 --> 3:18:25.200]  in 19 in the 80s, but it didn't happen in, in the securities market. And, and the other thing
[3:18:25.200 --> 3:18:29.680]  that didn't happen, Alex, was we didn't have what's called the, the plunge protection team,
[3:18:29.680 --> 3:18:36.160]  which is we, if you look at the market manipulation done by treasury and, and the Fed is a matter of
[3:18:36.160 --> 3:18:41.840]  policy, we didn't have that. And so, you know, a firm like, like a Goldman Sachs or the firms
[3:18:41.840 --> 3:18:46.400]  involved in this, in the squabble now with Geithner, you know, they didn't begin to have the
[3:18:46.400 --> 3:18:51.360]  opportunities to trade on inside information that now exists. You know, you've read the stories of
[3:18:51.360 --> 3:18:55.840]  front running or naked short selling, you know, all these things have been documented. And I think,
[3:18:56.480 --> 3:19:01.520]  you know, when I first, I live in Hickory Valley, Tennessee, and when I first moved here in 1999,
[3:19:01.520 --> 3:19:04.800]  saying that said, I want out of Washington and Wall Street, they've gone nuts.
[3:19:04.800 --> 3:19:11.680]  People here could not fathom the extent of the, of the corruption. But, but what I see
[3:19:11.680 --> 3:19:17.280]  happening, which is so exciting, your story about the Obama deception is a, is a great example,
[3:19:17.280 --> 3:19:22.480]  is people are beginning to realize, you know, this thing is not an adult. You know, we're not
[3:19:22.480 --> 3:19:27.120]  watching a group of adults, we're watching a group of people who've been getting away with it for
[3:19:27.120 --> 3:19:33.040]  so long that they are no longer connected to reality. And, and the rest of us are seeing if,
[3:19:33.040 --> 3:19:38.720]  you know, if, if a bunch of psychopaths can finance a 0% and you and I are subject to not
[3:19:38.720 --> 3:19:44.320]  only the constraints of the market, but the regulations and costs they load and pile on to us,
[3:19:44.320 --> 3:19:48.800]  then there's no way out. It's a little bit Curtis Mayfield had a great song called New World Order
[3:19:48.800 --> 3:19:54.400]  recent. He said, there's, there's one way in and no way out. And that's what Geithner is giving us
[3:19:54.400 --> 3:19:59.840]  financially. He's giving us a financial and they're hoping Northcom can, can, can protect them from
[3:19:59.840 --> 3:20:06.640]  us. Stay there. This is an emergency alert. People don't die of H1N1 infection. They die

[3:21:10.720 --> 3:21:16.880]  agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have tremendous influence
[3:21:16.880 --> 3:21:22.640]  on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon
[3:21:22.640 --> 3:21:28.720]  all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of
[3:21:28.720 --> 3:21:34.720]  our nation. The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[3:21:34.720 --> 3:21:39.200]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for
[3:21:39.200 --> 3:21:43.840]  more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody
[3:21:43.840 --> 3:21:50.720]  does care. And right now in Washington D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy
[3:21:50.720 --> 3:21:57.360]  of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high
[3:21:57.360 --> 3:22:04.320]  quality at prisonplanet.tv. On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping
[3:22:04.320 --> 3:22:09.440]  to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years. Unfortunately, with taxation,
[3:22:09.440 --> 3:22:14.720]  the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below
[3:22:14.720 --> 3:22:19.680]  the poverty line. Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve
[3:22:19.680 --> 3:22:24.720]  Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes? These questions
[3:22:24.720 --> 3:22:29.120]  and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[3:22:29.120 --> 3:22:34.240]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[3:22:34.240 --> 3:22:38.480]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

[3:23:08.160 --> 3:23:12.720]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want

[3:24:07.680 --> 3:24:09.360]  Obviously, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:24:11.760 --> 3:24:15.360]  they're trying to ram through government health care. The Democrats have now actually read it,
[3:24:15.360 --> 3:24:20.080]  discovered it's another bailout, another scam to the insurance companies owned by the banks.
[3:24:20.080 --> 3:24:26.240]  I want to get Catherine Austin Fitz take on that. Also, they're now reporting hundreds
[3:24:26.240 --> 3:24:31.840]  of thousands dead in Haiti from the earthquake. Hundreds of thousands dead. I mean, they're
[3:24:31.840 --> 3:24:36.800]  talking about all Americans being naked body scan and recorded, all courthouses having
[3:24:36.800 --> 3:24:40.560]  naked body scanners. They're going in all over the country. I found out two years ago,
[3:24:40.560 --> 3:24:45.120]  a year and a half ago, Denver already had it. I'm kind of all over the map here. It's just crazy.
[3:24:45.680 --> 3:24:49.840]  Earthquakes kill hundreds of thousands, but we've all got to go through naked body scanners
[3:24:49.840 --> 3:24:56.080]  because somebody might blow an airplane up. Oh, men and women are fighting in France. 150-plus
[3:24:56.080 --> 3:25:02.720]  people kill each other a year. Let's ban arguing or ban marriage outright. That's the mindset of
[3:25:02.720 --> 3:25:07.120]  these tyrants and how they're selling us on tyranny. They could care less about you and your
[3:25:07.120 --> 3:25:12.000]  safety. I've got a law enforcement article here where SWAT says options for multiple
[3:25:12.000 --> 3:25:16.960]  shooter tactics. Says we've got to get rid of Posse commentatus and put the army on the streets.
[3:25:16.960 --> 3:25:20.880]  Katharine, I'm all over the map here. It's just... No, no, no, no. Because you're dealing.
[3:25:20.880 --> 3:25:25.840]  You see the, like the Pillsbury Doughboy, you squeeze one place, it pops out another.
[3:25:26.400 --> 3:25:32.400]  And what you're seeing is the lockdown across the board. And it's coming in in every direction.
[3:25:32.960 --> 3:25:38.560]  And whether it's the economic insanity and sort of the two-class system or it's the,
[3:25:39.760 --> 3:25:44.080]  you know, what they're doing is they're rolling out all sorts of different controls
[3:25:44.080 --> 3:25:48.640]  because they know when people figure out that our retirement system has been basically
[3:25:49.280 --> 3:25:54.240]  moved offshore and now there's nothing to, you know, to keep the commitments, people are going
[3:25:54.240 --> 3:26:00.000]  to get upset. And by that time, they plan to have the food system and the healthcare system
[3:26:00.000 --> 3:26:05.040]  and all these different systems under lockdown. To me, one of the scariest ones you haven't
[3:26:05.040 --> 3:26:10.080]  brought up yet, Alex, is the idea of sending over a million Americans around to collect all sorts
[3:26:10.080 --> 3:26:15.760]  of data on all of us. I'm sure you've had, have you ever had Edwin Black on the show to describe
[3:26:15.760 --> 3:26:22.320]  how the Nazis put together their original databases? Yes, he wrote the book on IBM. And yes, the
[3:26:22.320 --> 3:26:29.760]  census people are now telling people to tell them about their stocks and bonds and what type of
[3:26:29.760 --> 3:26:35.200]  toilet they have. And now TSA is just downloading a large percentage of people's computers
[3:26:35.200 --> 3:26:40.560]  without warrants and just saying, we're keeping it. I mean, it's just wall-to-wall evil. Meanwhile,
[3:26:40.560 --> 3:26:46.240]  Geithner and others, who is most to blame in the crime, in the criminal acts from your expert view?
[3:26:46.240 --> 3:26:50.880]  How do we get Geithner indicted? I mean, there's open talk of it happening.
[3:26:50.880 --> 3:26:56.160]  Okay. Well, here, you know, I think, I think lots of pressure brought on, you know, this is a time
[3:26:56.160 --> 3:27:02.320]  when calls to Congress can make it very, and calls to the White House can make it very uncomfortable
[3:27:02.320 --> 3:27:08.480]  for the, for the White House to not make a change here. But at the heart of this matter, if you
[3:27:08.480 --> 3:27:14.400]  really want to make a significant shift, what we're going to have to do is, is work at the state
[3:27:14.400 --> 3:27:19.680]  and local level. And let me describe why. Have you seen the governor of Arizona state of the state
[3:27:19.680 --> 3:27:27.360]  address yet? No, I haven't. Okay. It's fabulous. She just came out. She said, and this was on
[3:27:27.360 --> 3:27:32.240]  healthcare. She said there are 14 attorney generals around the country, state attorney generals,
[3:27:32.240 --> 3:27:38.720]  now working together to prepare, you know, real 10th Amendment arguments to stop the
[3:27:38.720 --> 3:27:44.160]  implementation of this healthcare reform. And if my attorney general won't join them, I will.
[3:27:45.760 --> 3:27:50.560]  Wow. Right. And where this is all going to come down, it's going to come down to 10th Amendment
[3:27:50.560 --> 3:27:57.120]  and where we can get a governor, an attorney general, and a majority of the sheriff in a
[3:27:57.120 --> 3:28:03.440]  jurisdiction, because you know, Alex, the sheriff is the most powerful, you know, I mean, the,
[3:28:03.440 --> 3:28:08.160]  the sheriff elected representative in the county more powerful than the military. Yes. So, you
[3:28:08.160 --> 3:28:12.720]  know, but where we can align the attorney general, the governor and the majority of the sheriff in
[3:28:12.720 --> 3:28:16.480]  a jurisdiction, that's what's going to happen. Cause the only thing that's going to stop this
[3:28:16.480 --> 3:28:21.920]  is when you say no. And, and when, when they say that, when they declare the 10th Amendment,
[3:28:21.920 --> 3:28:25.760]  that's when we're going to have to have an argument about the cash flows, because you
[3:28:25.760 --> 3:28:30.880]  can't keep sending money to Washington if Washington keeps using it to break the law.
[3:28:30.880 --> 3:28:35.520]  And it's not just Washington. We have international banks running Washington. I mean, we don't
[3:28:35.520 --> 3:28:40.560]  have our government. Right. Congress is not in control. And so, you know, we're, it's almost
[3:28:40.560 --> 3:28:45.760]  like we're, we're at a party. Everybody's drunk. Everybody's stoned. Everything's out of control.
[3:28:45.760 --> 3:28:50.240]  Where do you build the power to stay? No. And ultimately, what you're going to have to do
[3:28:50.240 --> 3:28:54.960]  is you're going to need a combination of two things. You're going to need a group of, of
[3:28:54.960 --> 3:28:58.720]  leadership, and it's going to come down to governor, attorney general, and, and sheriff
[3:28:58.720 --> 3:29:02.400]  in a play. And either sheriff to show up and break up the party. Well, they're going to,
[3:29:02.400 --> 3:29:05.760]  one, they're going to have to say no, but they're going to have to do something else. Cause what
[3:29:05.760 --> 3:29:09.440]  the federal government has been doing to prevent them from saying no, is trying to get them to
[3:29:09.440 --> 3:29:14.160]  be financially dependent. Yes. And of course, the worst things get the economy, you know,
[3:29:14.160 --> 3:29:18.640]  we're in a downward spiral. And so we've got to reverse the economic spiral at the same time
[3:29:18.640 --> 3:29:23.200]  that you take a strong legal stand. And that's going to come down to the cash flows. And for
[3:29:23.200 --> 3:29:28.240]  years, what I've said is, and you can do this, if you get a 10th amendment movement in a place,
[3:29:28.240 --> 3:29:33.600]  what I've said is we ought to assert a common law right of offset for any money that's been wasted,
[3:29:33.600 --> 3:29:38.800]  spend, or, or is missing by criminal means. Alright, Catherine, not to interrupt, but long
[3:29:38.800 --> 3:29:42.400]  segment coming up, we got a break. We're going to come back and I want you to roll through this
[3:29:43.360 --> 3:29:47.760]  and a lot more. Stay with us. We'll also look into this new year, what you see happening with
[3:29:47.760 --> 3:29:54.000]  the economy versus the media spin. Stay with us salari.com. We're on the march. The empire's on
[3:29:54.000 --> 3:30:03.280]  the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you
[3:30:03.280 --> 3:30:08.320]  should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily
[3:30:08.320 --> 3:30:13.280]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much
[3:30:13.280 --> 3:30:18.560]  power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity
[3:30:18.560 --> 3:30:23.520]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[3:30:23.520 --> 3:30:29.040]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[3:30:29.040 --> 3:30:33.840]  the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year,
[3:30:33.840 --> 3:30:38.480]  thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power
[3:30:38.480 --> 3:30:43.200]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar
[3:30:43.200 --> 3:30:47.680]  power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more

[3:31:10.240 --> 3:31:15.840]  finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I've turned
[3:31:15.840 --> 3:31:22.000]  members' influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots. I think it's
[3:31:22.000 --> 3:31:28.400]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the republic identifies the
[3:31:28.400 --> 3:31:34.000]  enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty,
[3:31:34.000 --> 3:31:38.800]  and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[3:31:38.800 --> 3:31:42.880]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[3:31:42.880 --> 3:31:49.200]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the

[3:33:18.800 --> 3:33:27.040]  I can't get no relief. There must be some kind of way out of here. Said the Joker to the thief.
[3:33:27.040 --> 3:33:32.800]  We have to identify the parasite psychopaths that have given themselves the power
[3:33:32.800 --> 3:33:37.840]  to create money out of nothing. But that money doesn't have any real value till they convince us
[3:33:37.840 --> 3:33:44.720]  to borrow it. Then they get us into debt and take over the planet. Solari.com is the amazing
[3:33:44.720 --> 3:33:56.080]  investment and slash news site and so much more. Solari.com. Catherine Austin Fitz is our gracious
[3:33:56.080 --> 3:34:02.880]  guest, a very busy lady spending time with us today. We appreciate her coming on. Okay, you got cut
[3:34:02.880 --> 3:34:08.880]  off by the break and you were getting into where all this is going, what these people are doing,
[3:34:08.880 --> 3:34:16.800]  the police state grid. They're setting up the magnitude of Bankster Gate. And you, very astutely,
[3:34:16.800 --> 3:34:21.520]  people said, well, wait, Obama's been in office less than a year, right out of year next week.
[3:34:21.520 --> 3:34:26.160]  How can she say this administration for a year and a half? But all of my expert guests said that
[3:34:26.160 --> 3:34:33.200]  the last six months or so of Bush's reign, the power was fully given over to the Federal Reserve,
[3:34:33.200 --> 3:34:41.520]  to the banks, and that you had total fusion and coordination between the Bush bankers and the
[3:34:41.520 --> 3:34:47.440]  Obama bankers. This is completely bipartisan. Yes. You know, this is people who believe in freedom
[3:34:47.440 --> 3:34:53.760]  against people who don't. And it's got nothing to do with those kind of party lines. So this is
[3:34:53.760 --> 3:34:58.560]  totally bipartisan. And in fact, if you look at the people who've stayed between the Clinton
[3:34:58.560 --> 3:35:02.880]  administration and the Bush administration or then held over between the Bush administration,
[3:35:02.880 --> 3:35:08.480]  at a deeper level, it's the same team. So this is not, you know, this is not,
[3:35:09.200 --> 3:35:18.080]  two-party system is the one, you know, it's the party of just us. So now the opportunity, again,
[3:35:18.080 --> 3:35:24.080]  Alex, is if in those states where we have alignment between the governor, the attorney general,
[3:35:24.080 --> 3:35:28.720]  and the sheriff or majority of the sheriff, and you can take a legal stand, then the question is,
[3:35:28.720 --> 3:35:34.080]  how do you re-engineer the cash flows so that the, you know, so that the federal government
[3:35:34.080 --> 3:35:38.560]  and the Federal Reserve don't pull the rug out from under? And so there has to be an economic
[3:35:38.560 --> 3:35:42.960]  plan that has to deal with all the money we're sending to Washington and all the money we're
[3:35:42.960 --> 3:35:49.200]  getting back. And the reality is, I think they're very powerful legal arguments that say, at a
[3:35:49.200 --> 3:35:53.600]  state or local level, you can assert common law right of offset for all the money that's been
[3:35:53.600 --> 3:35:58.800]  stolen, all the money that's missing, escrow federal taxes and say, you know something,
[3:35:58.800 --> 3:36:03.520]  don't send any money, we'll pay our own stuff here and literally take control of the cash flows.
[3:36:04.080 --> 3:36:08.000]  And, but what it's going to mean is in a lot of different industries,
[3:36:08.000 --> 3:36:11.360]  we're going to have to start behaving in very productive ways because the,
[3:36:12.000 --> 3:36:17.120]  one of the ways that the money has worked is the banksters are allowed to get away with murder
[3:36:17.120 --> 3:36:20.960]  because we get a lot of subsidies and we've allowed to, you know, we've allowed ourselves
[3:36:20.960 --> 3:36:26.960]  to get very unproductive. So we have, for example, we have a whole local medical community and the
[3:36:26.960 --> 3:36:32.320]  infrastructure in every one of our places and state that is used to very, you know, it's got a
[3:36:32.320 --> 3:36:39.040]  very high cost infrastructure. So we're all going to have to organize and change. And the biggest
[3:36:39.040 --> 3:36:44.800]  one is we now have, you know, say I live in a county, the war on drugs is our biggest business.
[3:36:44.800 --> 3:36:50.160]  It's our biggest industry. And we don't have enough people to farm because everybody's too
[3:36:50.160 --> 3:36:55.840]  busy dealing or growing drugs. So, you know, we're going to have to change the local level yet,
[3:36:55.840 --> 3:36:59.360]  and we're going to have to get very, very productive. Now, if we're willing to do that,
[3:36:59.360 --> 3:37:04.320]  we can absolutely turn around the, you know, the economic spiral because it's small business
[3:37:04.320 --> 3:37:09.120]  that creates jobs. And at some point, prisons and drug dealing is, you know, it's not something
[3:37:09.120 --> 3:37:16.400]  that makes a nation great. The parasite, the parasite economy is killing the host. Yep.
[3:37:16.400 --> 3:37:24.320]  Yep. Yeah. Well, it's more than, you know, it is now eating through a great deal of muscle. And we
[3:37:24.320 --> 3:37:28.400]  have another year or two or three to make this change. But if we don't make it in a year or two
[3:37:28.400 --> 3:37:36.240]  or three, then we are really, you know, we will have gone across into the abyss. So we have a
[3:37:36.240 --> 3:37:40.800]  period now, and it's all going to come down to the state and local governments, whether we can get
[3:37:40.800 --> 3:37:46.880]  a turn. And my guess is in some places you can, in some, you can't, you and I are both speaking.
[3:37:46.880 --> 3:37:51.440]  I'm in Tennessee, you're in Texas. We're in states where the governors have played a leadership
[3:37:51.440 --> 3:37:55.200]  role in the 10th Amendment, and there are a lot of sheriffs and there's a lot of infrastructure.
[3:37:55.760 --> 3:38:01.280]  And this is not impossible. And we have more and more states, 30 plus moving towards 10th Amendment
[3:38:01.280 --> 3:38:06.720]  declarations. The media spins that like it's a secession or something. It's not. It's declaring
[3:38:06.720 --> 3:38:12.640]  10th and 9th Amendment. And we have those success stories and leaders at the state level that will
[3:38:12.640 --> 3:38:20.560]  speak out and will be bold. We can then catapult that movement also into Washington and accurately
[3:38:20.560 --> 3:38:27.040]  assess the criminals that we're facing. And so we do see some bright things happening.
[3:38:27.040 --> 3:38:33.120]  What we've seen up until now is every time you start to see at the state and local level,
[3:38:33.120 --> 3:38:39.120]  people start to really stand up and lead that way. They get bought off. The banksters are willing
[3:38:39.120 --> 3:38:44.720]  to throw an awful lot of money to buy a leader off. Or their girlfriend. They play the control
[3:38:44.720 --> 3:38:49.680]  file. They play the dirty trick. They play the entrapment. There's all sorts of positive incentives
[3:38:49.680 --> 3:38:54.640]  and negative games they can play. And I think the question is, is there a way we can communicate
[3:38:54.640 --> 3:38:59.840]  and organize locally so that they can't? Because if you look at all the different laws that are
[3:38:59.840 --> 3:39:06.000]  happening right now, healthcare, food safety is a big one. Census, all these things. We are
[3:39:06.000 --> 3:39:11.040]  across the constitutional line. And the important thing I want to make, really the important point
[3:39:11.040 --> 3:39:15.840]  everybody needs to get in their spirit, is these are the things that are destroying the economy.
[3:39:16.400 --> 3:39:22.320]  I mean, when you, it's like taking a horse or taking a boxer and tying his hands and tying
[3:39:22.320 --> 3:39:27.040]  his legs and then putting him in the ring. He's going to lose. So when you make this many rules
[3:39:27.040 --> 3:39:33.280]  and you, you overlay this much expense on small business, you kill the heart of the economy.
[3:39:33.280 --> 3:39:40.560]  And so, and so all of this stuff is, is what's killing the economy. You turn that around and
[3:39:40.560 --> 3:39:45.760]  you can unleash incredible wealth. Let me give you a perfect example. Do you know who is the,
[3:39:45.760 --> 3:39:51.120]  the number one provider of services to the food stamp program in this country? Alex?
[3:39:51.120 --> 3:39:58.960]  Yes, it's offshore central banks. It's JP Morgan Chase. And they outsource the data
[3:39:58.960 --> 3:40:03.520]  servicing to India, which means in Tennessee, which is one of the states where they provide
[3:40:03.520 --> 3:40:12.320]  the services, we have, we now have 20% of our population on food stamps. Okay. So more than
[3:40:12.320 --> 3:40:17.840]  a million people on food stamps. And, and those people, many of them get unemployment checks or
[3:40:17.840 --> 3:40:23.680]  welfare checks. They get food stamps and they sit around and we pay them not to work. Meantime,
[3:40:23.680 --> 3:40:29.600]  we have Boku, beautiful farmland, you know, the farmers can't find labor. Everybody's too busy,
[3:40:29.600 --> 3:40:35.520]  you know, dealing drugs or, you know, being on whatever government subsidy. And, and, and we've
[3:40:35.520 --> 3:40:42.480]  got the big agribusiness moving down into Latin America, controlling the agriculture, you know,
[3:40:42.480 --> 3:40:47.440]  shipping the food in. It's, it's highly processed. It's makes, makes us sick. That's part of the
[3:40:47.440 --> 3:40:53.360]  health care problem. And so, and, and JP Morgan Chase is doing the servicing work. And the theory
[3:40:53.360 --> 3:40:59.440]  is that we can pay somebody in India or in Latin America to do something that, that the people
[3:40:59.440 --> 3:41:04.160]  who are getting those food stamps could do a year. And it's cheaper to pay them not to work and then
[3:41:04.160 --> 3:41:08.560]  pay somebody else in Latin America to do the farming and somebody in Asia to do the data
[3:41:08.560 --> 3:41:14.480]  servicing. And that's just not true. The numbers don't add up. And that's why if, if the state and,
[3:41:14.480 --> 3:41:20.800]  and local players can sit down and say, okay, how could we re-engineer this, move all those jobs back
[3:41:20.800 --> 3:41:26.480]  to our state, do this on an economic basis, where's the opportunity to create lots more
[3:41:27.040 --> 3:41:32.480]  cash flows into the local small businesses, lots, lots more equity, lots more skills, lots more
[3:41:32.480 --> 3:41:38.320]  knowledge. You know, it's all there, but you're going to have to deal with, okay, we can't let
[3:41:38.320 --> 3:41:42.960]  the feds have control because they're literally draining our lifeblocks. It's like a vampire.
[3:41:43.520 --> 3:41:47.200]  Well, I think the number one mission is to continue to point out their criminals out on
[3:41:47.200 --> 3:41:52.240]  the open who won't say where trillions of dollars went. And then we find out it went to them personally
[3:41:52.240 --> 3:41:56.800]  and they ordered the holding companies that they laundered the money through like AIG
[3:41:56.800 --> 3:42:03.200]  to not in federal filings tell the feds or the public that, that the very bankers running policy
[3:42:03.200 --> 3:42:08.800]  and government were the ones that were getting the money. I mean, a five-year-old can understand that
[3:42:08.800 --> 3:42:14.800]  basic fraud and the fact that we do hear talk of indictment on MSNBC and we do even see Ed
[3:42:14.800 --> 3:42:20.800]  Schultz saying, man, Obama's really bad. What about the Obama hoax? I mean, obviously, it's all dog
[3:42:20.800 --> 3:42:25.600]  and pony show. Obviously, you know, eight years of Bush, people figure out he's a fraud, the new
[3:42:25.600 --> 3:42:30.000]  savior, he's just meant to con people long enough for them to get their agenda through.
[3:42:30.000 --> 3:42:34.240]  Then Glenn Beck's organizing the right wing to get Republicans back in.
[3:42:34.240 --> 3:42:39.280]  The reality is the change we're talking about cannot be engineered to Washington.
[3:42:39.280 --> 3:42:42.880]  Alex, no, I know, but we need to discredit Washington is what I'm saying.
[3:42:42.880 --> 3:42:46.640]  What? So that, so that people will accept the states taking back over.
[3:42:47.360 --> 3:42:52.160]  You, you have got, you've got to make the changes because the, the re-engineering that
[3:42:52.160 --> 3:42:56.160]  has to happen in Austin, Texas is totally different than the re-engineering that has
[3:42:56.160 --> 3:43:01.040]  to happen in Hickory Valley, Tennessee. And so there's got to be a fundamental economic change
[3:43:01.040 --> 3:43:06.880]  bottom up. Okay, here's an example in Austin. They spend 170 million on the buses that 1%
[3:43:06.880 --> 3:43:13.840]  of Austin uses and they spend 70 million on the roads. I mean, I mean, Austin is run by,
[3:43:13.840 --> 3:43:17.920]  they're not liberals. They're a bunch of criminals that openly rob and steal everything,
[3:43:17.920 --> 3:43:22.160]  steal property. I mean, everywhere I go, it's just crooks running everything.
[3:43:22.160 --> 3:43:28.080]  Right. And you know why? Because we have created a financial mechanism that would allow us to
[3:43:28.080 --> 3:43:33.520]  borrow massive amounts of money globally. And so we've had massive amounts of money and,
[3:43:33.520 --> 3:43:38.320]  and as long as the criminals could engineer that subsidy, this could keep going and they
[3:43:38.320 --> 3:43:43.200]  could offer more money at cheaper prices. And we've been willing to go along with that. Now,
[3:43:43.200 --> 3:43:47.840]  you, you were, do you remember my red button story? Yes, but you, I recap it.
[3:43:47.840 --> 3:43:53.120]  Okay. So I was giving a speech to a group of people called Spiritual Frontiers Foundation.
[3:43:53.120 --> 3:43:57.760]  They have a conference once a year to talk about how we can evolve our society spiritually,
[3:43:57.760 --> 3:44:02.320]  very committed, dedicated people. I'm in the middle of the speech and explaining
[3:44:02.320 --> 3:44:06.240]  that the Department of Justice in 1999 had told a reporter I was working with
[3:44:06.240 --> 3:44:11.200]  that the U.S. economy launders 500 billion to a trillion dollars a year of all dirty money. So
[3:44:11.200 --> 3:44:16.320]  not just narcotics trafficking, but illegal gambling, tax evasion, financial fraud, everything.
[3:44:16.320 --> 3:44:20.880]  Okay. Now with the financial fraud, it's much bigger, but, but at that time, 500 billion to
[3:44:20.880 --> 3:44:26.640]  a trillion. So I said to this wonderfully spiritual evolved audience, if you could push a red button
[3:44:26.640 --> 3:44:31.520]  to stop all narcotics trafficking in your community, your neighborhood, your, you know,
[3:44:31.520 --> 3:44:35.040]  your country tomorrow, thus offending the people who control all this money,
[3:44:35.040 --> 3:44:39.200]  who here would push the button out of a hundred people? Only one would push the button.
[3:44:39.200 --> 3:44:43.760]  I said, why would you not push the button? They said, we don't want our mutual funds to go down.
[3:44:43.760 --> 3:44:48.080]  We don't want our government checks. But see, that's the scam justice be done.
[3:44:48.080 --> 3:44:53.760]  May the heavens fall. I mean, all of these parasitic systems cost more than they make
[3:44:53.760 --> 3:45:00.160]  and they're wrong. Right. And so, and so it's going, what it's going to come down to is we cannot,
[3:45:00.160 --> 3:45:04.320]  we've seen the fed monetize the whole treasury and mortgage market last year.
[3:45:04.960 --> 3:45:10.400]  And so we can't, obviously you can't keep monetizing at this rate. And so now the day has
[3:45:10.400 --> 3:45:15.760]  come where the bell is ringing and saying, we can't get free money forever anymore.
[3:45:16.320 --> 3:45:21.680]  So something's got to give and we've got to change. And those changes are going to happen,
[3:45:21.680 --> 3:45:26.400]  Alex, in the places where our governors, our attorney generals and our sheriffs can come
[3:45:26.400 --> 3:45:30.880]  together, assert 10th amendment right. And now we're all going to have to support them
[3:45:30.880 --> 3:45:35.920]  in reengineering the economic flows. But when it comes out the other side of the sausage maker,
[3:45:35.920 --> 3:45:42.480]  we're all going to have to be a lot more productive. Well, it is true that half the population is on
[3:45:42.480 --> 3:45:47.920]  some form of government dole or payment or job. And the government's only getting more aggressive,
[3:45:47.920 --> 3:45:54.400]  more parasitic, more militarized. Right. And, and, and what the cops and the bureaucrats don't
[3:45:54.400 --> 3:45:58.880]  understand is the bankers have already moved offshore. They're literally for three years
[3:45:58.880 --> 3:46:02.720]  been buying homes offshore. They believe they're probably going to lose control,
[3:46:02.720 --> 3:46:08.240]  but they've already run off with the bag of money. Right. And that's why this guy's nerd.
[3:46:08.240 --> 3:46:12.960]  I think it is very, very important. I said in my year in wrap up, which I called the year of the
[3:46:13.520 --> 3:46:20.400]  giant vampire squid, uh, the wonderful story from Rolling Stone, uh, declared Goldman Sachs,
[3:46:20.400 --> 3:46:26.160]  the giant vampire squid. Basically what these guys did, Alex, in the 90s and early 2000s,
[3:46:26.160 --> 3:46:31.920]  they moved trillions of dollars out of the country, a lot of it illegal to do that. They
[3:46:31.920 --> 3:46:37.920]  issued massive fraudulent securities and derivatives. And what this bailout did was it refinanced them
[3:46:37.920 --> 3:46:44.240]  out of the fraud. And so they have pulled off not only the financial coup d'etat, but pushing the
[3:46:44.240 --> 3:46:49.920]  liabilities for the fraudulent securities they issued to do it back onto the taxpayers. And
[3:46:49.920 --> 3:46:53.840]  they're, you know, they're basically, they're pulling their train out of the station and
[3:46:53.840 --> 3:46:59.440]  leaving us to grapple. And they're moving their base of operations to China and openly bad-mouthing
[3:46:59.440 --> 3:47:03.600]  America and saying it's not a good place to invest to further depress it so they can buy
[3:47:03.600 --> 3:47:10.400]  everything up. I mean, the door is not completely shut. The guy, a guy, a guy through investigation
[3:47:10.400 --> 3:47:16.480]  in a diamond, because we now have, remember, we have guys that are saying, Oh, you know, I proposed
[3:47:17.120 --> 3:47:22.880]  a deal where I didn't give Goldman Sachs a hundred cents on the dollar. And they said they were
[3:47:22.880 --> 3:47:26.800]  fully hedged so they didn't care. And they'd rather see a default. They'd pick it up on the
[3:47:26.800 --> 3:47:32.800]  other side. And we now have the Goldman CEO and chairman saying in testimony today, well,
[3:47:32.800 --> 3:47:37.440]  wait a minute, you know, nobody offered me that deal. So one of them has got to be lying. So we
[3:47:37.440 --> 3:47:42.240]  now have pitted the secretary of the treasury and the chairman Goldman Sachs and one has got to be
[3:47:42.240 --> 3:47:49.200]  lying. So if you can turn this into, you know, testimony under oath investigation, you know,
[3:47:49.200 --> 3:47:55.040]  you can still open a door and unravel this whole thing. So it is not, you know, it's never,
[3:47:55.040 --> 3:47:59.520]  it's never, since I'm a big woman, I hate to say it's never over till the fat ladies things,
[3:47:59.520 --> 3:48:04.880]  but it's never over till the fat ladies things. So I think that I think you're hammering on the
[3:48:04.880 --> 3:48:09.920]  Geithner and a possible Geithner indictment is very, very important. Cause let me tell you,
[3:48:10.560 --> 3:48:15.600]  it is inconceivable to me that there is, that the Geithner is not criminally liable for what's
[3:48:15.600 --> 3:48:21.440]  happened. Well, we have to pierce this veil of infallibility and, and, and, and, and popery or
[3:48:21.440 --> 3:48:26.080]  whatever you want to call it, where the elites just stumble around in fancy suits with SWAT teams
[3:48:26.080 --> 3:48:31.440]  around them saying, I will rob this, I will rob that. Everyone just, just bows down to them. And
[3:48:31.440 --> 3:48:36.560]  the image of these criminals being indicted or in trouble like Watergate, but these crimes are a
[3:48:36.560 --> 3:48:42.000]  trillion times that literally could, could bring them down just like Copenhagen went down. You
[3:48:42.000 --> 3:48:45.920]  know, the whole Copenhagen thing went down in flames. The banks wanting to leverage a new
[3:48:45.920 --> 3:48:51.520]  Ponzi scheme on global carbon tax. I mean, on every front, they're in trouble. Well, do the, do the
[3:48:51.520 --> 3:49:01.440]  math on that one trade. Geithner gave Goldman Sachs $10 billion. Okay. Now, if the average American
[3:49:01.440 --> 3:49:06.480]  taxpayer pays a hundred thousand lifetime, a hundred thousand dollars of federal taxes
[3:49:06.480 --> 3:49:11.760]  in a lifetime, say how much is 10 billion divided by a hundred thousand? That's how many people
[3:49:11.760 --> 3:49:18.480]  are going to work their whole life for that one giveaway by Timmy Geithner. In other words,
[3:49:18.480 --> 3:49:25.360]  don't think of it as $10 billion. Think of it as we got to do the math. Think of it as that many
[3:49:25.360 --> 3:49:32.160]  lives. It's slavery. It is, I mean, it's literally slavery. Let me do the math. And it sets the
[3:49:32.160 --> 3:49:38.960]  precedent for even, if we don't stop them now, they're setting up new bubbles, new scams, new
[3:49:38.960 --> 3:49:43.360]  frauds. Right. So if I'm not mistaken, a hundred thousand people are going to work their entire
[3:49:43.360 --> 3:49:52.080]  life to pay the taxes for Geithner to do that. You know, and it's not just, here's the thing,
[3:49:52.080 --> 3:49:56.640]  Alex. It's not just Americans. It's people all over the world because people all over the world
[3:49:56.640 --> 3:50:02.960]  are being forced to buy Treasury securities. You know, it's a global taxation system. They buy
[3:50:02.960 --> 3:50:08.480]  Treasury securities. The Treasuries go down 5, 10% a year. And so they get drained just like
[3:50:08.480 --> 3:50:13.200]  communities all over America being drained. It's global. It's not just in America. And so,
[3:50:13.200 --> 3:50:20.320]  you know, here, I mean, people are giving up luxuries, you know, or now necessities to play
[3:50:20.320 --> 3:50:24.160]  this game. But, you know, people are losing their lives all over the world because of this drain.
[3:50:24.880 --> 3:50:30.160]  So it's not just when you give away 10 billion, you know, say it costs you give away a hundred
[3:50:30.160 --> 3:50:35.920]  thousand tax lives in America, but you're literally giving away lives, you know, around the world.
[3:50:35.920 --> 3:50:41.360]  So it's a slavery, it's a slavery system engineered through financial means. And it's
[3:50:41.360 --> 3:50:44.240]  highly invisible. But I think we're beginning to understand it.
[3:50:44.800 --> 3:50:49.600]  It is a high-tech slavery. We're going to come back and get into more solutions with Catherine
[3:50:49.600 --> 3:50:55.760]  Austin Fitz of Solari.com. I agree with her. One of the biggest things we have against the
[3:50:55.760 --> 3:51:01.600]  enemy is the states and their rightful power and arresting these criminals.
[3:51:01.600 --> 3:51:06.880]  America is in deep, deep trouble because we don't know our rights. Let's get real freedom back into
[3:51:06.880 --> 3:51:12.080]  America by teaching and promoting the Bill of Rights with the 2010 Freedom Calendar. Why?

[3:52:08.320 --> 3:52:13.920]  to not relive history. Is it finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[3:52:13.920 --> 3:52:20.080]  Americans at home? I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[3:52:20.080 --> 3:52:26.400]  calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:52:26.400 --> 3:52:32.160]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel held
[3:52:32.160 --> 3:52:37.280]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner,
[3:52:37.280 --> 3:52:41.600]  Bernanke, their arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying,
[3:52:41.600 --> 3:52:46.240]  who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington,
[3:52:46.240 --> 3:52:53.280]  D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD

[3:53:06.000 --> 3:53:10.880]  here's a few facts about your food you may want to change. Did you know that nearly 100% of the
[3:53:10.880 --> 3:53:15.680]  food on store shelves comes from a few corporations and that most is genetically engineered,
[3:53:15.680 --> 3:53:20.640]  chemically sprayed and transported great distances? Baker Creek heirloom seed company like you

[3:54:04.720 --> 3:54:10.080]  Folks, we're offering a new video at infowars.com on DVD. It's shadow government,
[3:54:10.080 --> 3:54:16.640]  but very impressive with Catherine Albrecht, G. Evergryff and many others. This film is really
[3:54:16.640 --> 3:54:22.080]  well done and will wake up a lot of people, get shadow government today. I saw the trailer we
[3:54:22.080 --> 3:54:26.320]  put up for it on YouTube and there's some guy in there saying, Jones is being sensationalist.
[3:54:26.320 --> 3:54:31.280]  There's no such thing as a shadow government. They have now admitted the shadow government,
[3:54:31.280 --> 3:54:37.040]  the national security state. It's all over the news. Just Google shadow government. You'll see
[3:54:37.040 --> 3:54:42.400]  hundreds of mainstream news articles. People are still kind of in the old propaganda of 10 years
[3:54:42.400 --> 3:54:48.160]  ago that there's no global government. It's all being announced and you people don't want to admit
[3:54:48.160 --> 3:54:52.880]  you were wrong. So you're denying it's happening because you're lazy. Now, I know the listeners
[3:54:52.880 --> 3:54:56.560]  aren't like that, but you got to give this film shadow government. You can get fall, the republic
[3:54:56.560 --> 3:55:01.920]  have price when you get it with shadow government. You can also get one of the free t-shirt deals.
[3:55:01.920 --> 3:55:08.240]  Got a bunch of specials at info wars.com. There's also the salari report and you can subscribe
[3:55:08.240 --> 3:55:14.880]  to that at salari.com and she breaks down precious metals. You name it. Just incredible incisive
[3:55:14.880 --> 3:55:20.000]  info on the economy. Catherine Austin fits. Where do you see gold going even though they've been
[3:55:20.000 --> 3:55:25.360]  trying to drive it down? It's going back up now. Well, I think we're in a long-term bull market for
[3:55:25.360 --> 3:55:29.840]  what I call tangibles, real things, you know, throughout history, through investment history,
[3:55:29.840 --> 3:55:35.760]  Alex, you go through periods where financial assets perform much better than than tangibles
[3:55:35.760 --> 3:55:41.520]  and then tangibles perform much better than financial assets. And so, but what's happening is
[3:55:41.520 --> 3:55:45.360]  that the investor, Jimmy Rogers, somebody asked him whether he believes in peak oil. He said,
[3:55:45.360 --> 3:55:50.400]  forget peak oil. Let's peak everything. And you know, the fundamental economics of the planet is
[3:55:50.400 --> 3:55:56.240]  we have we have 6 billion people in growing and there's only so much real stuff, whether it's
[3:55:56.240 --> 3:56:02.240]  space metals or precious metals, commodities. So, so we're absolutely in a long-term bull market.
[3:56:02.240 --> 3:56:07.280]  And when you have all this inflation and paper scams, people always run back to real assets.
[3:56:07.280 --> 3:56:13.360]  And that's, you know, if you look at the one currency that people recognize, not because
[3:56:13.360 --> 3:56:17.840]  anybody requires them to or not because the government has it the law, but the currency
[3:56:17.840 --> 3:56:23.200]  that is liquid and recognized all around the world is gold and silver. And so, so I think what
[3:56:23.200 --> 3:56:29.120]  you're seeing is a lot of, you know, we've printed all this paper, whether it's treasury
[3:56:29.120 --> 3:56:34.960]  securities or derivatives or other kinds of fiat currencies. And, and, you know, and now people
[3:56:34.960 --> 3:56:40.080]  are saying, well, you know, what can I, what can I hold is real? And not only that, what can I hold
[3:56:40.080 --> 3:56:44.880]  is real that I can put in my pocket and take with me. So I think we're in a long-term bull market
[3:56:44.880 --> 3:56:49.760]  for precious metals. I don't think it's a, you know, it's a magic bullet. You know, you can't,
[3:56:49.760 --> 3:56:54.880]  it's not food. It's not water. You know, so it's no magic bullet. It's got to be part of your
[3:56:54.880 --> 3:57:00.960]  portfolio. You know, this is definitely an asset that people should understand and consider
[3:57:01.680 --> 3:57:04.960]  that I'm, I'm low to say it should be in everybody's portfolio because everybody's
[3:57:04.960 --> 3:57:09.840]  different, you know, and so there's unique, you know, it's unique for everybody. It's,
[3:57:09.840 --> 3:57:15.200]  it's extremely volatile. So it's something that you, before you, you know, before you tiptoe
[3:57:15.200 --> 3:57:18.720]  into this, it's something you really, really want to learn. And we have some great audio
[3:57:18.720 --> 3:57:24.160]  seminars, you know, and of course on the Salier report, we do one, one a month on precious
[3:57:24.160 --> 3:57:29.440]  metals. So there's a lot of good information if you, if you want to learn more. Well, Catherine,
[3:57:29.440 --> 3:57:34.080]  I appreciate you spending time with us. Even if we don't get Geithner indicted and they're talking
[3:57:34.080 --> 3:57:38.800]  about it and they're having congressional hearings about it, we can at least politically
[3:57:39.840 --> 3:57:46.560]  convict them and politically crucify them because they deserve it. And just openly in the court of
[3:57:46.560 --> 3:57:51.440]  public opinion, explain, these are a bunch of swindlers. So as they try to carry out more
[3:57:51.440 --> 3:57:57.760]  scams in the future, people don't buy into it. It's, it's, it's so important, Alex, that everyone
[3:57:57.760 --> 3:58:05.760]  understand that, that we're, we're looking at a group of people who really have gone across the line
[3:58:06.320 --> 3:58:11.120]  and are not going to come back. These are not, these are not responsible leaders that we can
[3:58:11.120 --> 3:58:16.880]  look to. These are people who are across the line in something that is really, if it keeps going,
[3:58:16.880 --> 3:58:23.040]  is going to kill many of us. Well, that's it. I mean, they have already stolen tens of trillions,
[3:58:23.040 --> 3:58:29.120]  robbed, committed crimes openly. Why not commit a million more crimes and they're wrecking society
[3:58:29.120 --> 3:58:35.280]  to do it, order out of chaos. Catherine Austin fits. Thank you. Thank you so much for spending
[3:58:35.280 --> 3:58:41.040]  time with us. Retransmission with so many incredible guests starts now infowars.com.
[3:58:42.960 --> 3:58:48.720]  Great job crew. Thank you for listening to GCN. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent live.com today.
[3:58:48.720 --> 3:58:53.600]  All right folks, retransmission starts now. Take by this. Hello, this is Alex Jones with some
[3:58:53.600 --> 3:58:58.400]  important questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm,
[3:58:58.400 --> 3:59:03.760]  how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and
[3:59:03.760 --> 3:59:08.880]  the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you
[3:59:08.880 --> 3:59:13.840]  want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper
[3:59:13.840 --> 3:59:18.800]  identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine
[3:59:18.800 --> 3:59:23.600]  and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out
[3:59:23.600 --> 3:59:29.280]  all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom
[3:59:29.280 --> 3:59:34.560]  and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm
[3:59:34.560 --> 3:59:42.800]  Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633
