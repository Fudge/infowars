[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:29.520]  I've got a lot on my mind I know you've got a lot on your mind we've got an
[00:29.520 --> 00:33.800]  important broadcast lined up for you today thank you for joining us it is
[00:33.800 --> 00:40.440]  Monday the 13th day of June 2011 we're gonna be live here for the next three
[00:40.440 --> 00:46.240]  hours today Dominique bedding the member of the Swiss Parliament who did try to
[00:46.240 --> 00:49.920]  get into Bilderberg will be joining us of course a member of the European Union
[00:49.920 --> 00:57.000]  Parliament was beat up and we've got those reports MEP assaulted by
[00:57.000 --> 01:03.760]  Bilderberg security to take legal action that's from the big Swiss National AP
[01:03.760 --> 01:10.880]  equivalent Swiss info I'm gonna attempt to go over all this news today and
[01:10.880 --> 01:18.000]  there's a lot of it but this year's Bilderberg was extremely historical and
[01:18.000 --> 01:21.680]  got more attention on it than any other Bilderberg group meeting in
[01:21.680 --> 01:26.800]  history and people are asking why are elected quote officials meeting with
[01:26.800 --> 01:30.520]  the fortune 100 in secret and what are they doing well we know what they're
[01:30.520 --> 01:35.200]  doing they're openly trying through governments to rob the wealth of the
[01:35.200 --> 01:39.320]  general population through quote bailouts they are pushing monopoly
[01:39.320 --> 01:44.880]  capitalism or fascism the opposite of the free market and I've made a film of
[01:44.880 --> 01:48.360]  course in game blueprint for global enslavement detailing many of their
[01:48.360 --> 01:51.960]  admitted crimes many of their own minutes many of their own books they've
[01:51.960 --> 01:55.600]  written Bilderberg group members write books and brag about how they're setting
[01:55.600 --> 02:01.040]  up a world government and it's very exciting to go from the point of being
[02:01.040 --> 02:07.240]  made fun of a decade ago or more if you talked about it to now people knowing
[02:07.240 --> 02:11.360]  that it's a real situation identifying the actual puppet masters not the
[02:11.360 --> 02:23.800]  puppets Bill Maher talking about it CNN Fox News CNBC Newsweek they have been
[02:23.800 --> 02:28.480]  forced associated press reported on it one hour after the meeting ended they
[02:28.480 --> 02:31.160]  did leave early they normally leave in the afternoon or even stay over till
[02:31.160 --> 02:34.920]  Monday this is the earliest they've ever left according to Jim Tucker some were
[02:34.920 --> 02:40.640]  helicoptering out by Saturday there was a torch lit procession and then they
[02:40.640 --> 02:47.360]  said we're bringing candles to David Rockefeller's birthday on midnight
[02:47.360 --> 02:52.320]  June 12th so it'd be Saturday into Sunday night we have video of that
[02:52.320 --> 02:56.720]  marching with their torches like villagers coming to burn it down but
[02:56.720 --> 03:01.640]  they were nonviolent it was making a point really good satire a political
[03:01.640 --> 03:05.160]  satire away saying oh we're bringing you a birthday cake and we have these
[03:05.160 --> 03:12.640]  burning tip torches as candles for you and then the police backed off and
[03:12.640 --> 03:16.360]  weren't holding people back you know 300 yards like they were previously after
[03:16.360 --> 03:19.320]  three members of the Swiss Parliament showed up and delivered letters to the
[03:19.320 --> 03:22.880]  police chief and others and said look you will allow the demonstrators you will
[03:22.880 --> 03:27.960]  allow the media you'll stop harassing people we have free speech here and so
[03:27.960 --> 03:32.240]  the police their body language can it wasn't that oppressive before but it got
[03:32.240 --> 03:37.720]  very positive after that but even I at the point of watching villagers with
[03:37.720 --> 03:43.960]  their torches I this is some amazing stuff this is some amazing stuff and
[03:43.960 --> 03:47.960]  well we'll play that video shot by we are change Switzerland coming up
[03:47.960 --> 03:54.560]  obviously I'm not just going to cover the whole Bilderberg situation today

[08:45.240 --> 08:51.200]  June 2011 and we have a lot of important news to talk about obviously the
[08:51.200 --> 09:00.840]  incredible ground-breaking aftermath of what has been unfolding with bilderberg
[09:00.840 --> 09:06.880]  in the last four days and I want to go over the highlights of what has
[09:06.880 --> 09:14.160]  developed and also a transpired Saturday evening and Sunday as 125 of the
[09:14.160 --> 09:20.440]  richest and most powerful people met in secret and we know what their agenda is
[09:20.440 --> 09:24.600]  we have moles inside it is the end of the free internet and free speeches we
[09:24.600 --> 09:29.920]  know it it is massive tax increases the lion's share of the money paid directly
[09:29.920 --> 09:36.120]  through government into private coffers expanded bailouts as the thievery is
[09:36.120 --> 09:44.960]  labeled for the public they always give it some spin-filled name to hide what
[09:44.960 --> 09:48.440]  they're really doing we're gonna get into what's happening with the stock
[09:48.440 --> 09:54.600]  market we're gonna cover the election 2012 starting to heat up here in the
[09:54.600 --> 10:02.120]  United States also in texas bandera county the sheriff is out in the news
[10:02.120 --> 10:07.520]  saying that he's got terrorist domestic terrorist in his county ready to
[10:07.520 --> 10:12.280]  strike any minute and it turns out it's people that don't like the private
[10:12.280 --> 10:16.520]  fellow reserve of the bilderberg group or support ron paul and the fact that the
[10:16.520 --> 10:20.320]  police more and more are going public with what the feds are teaching them
[10:20.320 --> 10:24.360]  behind the scenes see the feds don't say this publicly because they know it
[10:24.360 --> 10:28.760]  would create a political firestorm and his political demonization and as a
[10:28.760 --> 10:32.760]  fraud their mayac and homeland security reports other documents that good
[10:32.760 --> 10:40.600]  police have sent us over the years but what happens is local police tend to
[10:40.600 --> 10:45.640]  then go public with what they've been trained in just like pastors three years
[10:45.640 --> 10:50.120]  ago three years after we broke the news here on the genesis radio network that
[10:50.120 --> 10:54.640]  secretly homeland security and fema have accrued it now over a hundred thousand
[10:54.640 --> 11:00.080]  preachers think about how creepy and in soviet style that is to spy on their
[11:00.080 --> 11:04.440]  flocks to teach them that guns are bad and to go to the fema center when you're
[11:04.440 --> 11:09.280]  ordered to and take your inoculations roman's 13 and even though we had those
[11:09.280 --> 11:13.120]  documents with fema phone numbers on them and the actual training manuals
[11:13.120 --> 11:18.520]  folks didn't believe it for three years until on multiple newscast in louisiana
[11:18.520 --> 11:23.560]  and in california local pastors and police went public and said yes we do
[11:23.560 --> 11:27.840]  what the government tells us it's roman's 13 and during an emergency take
[11:27.840 --> 11:31.680]  the shots go where you're told we're called the clergy response teams we're
[11:31.680 --> 11:40.360]  of the lord so this is the type of system guys I can't reach my coffee and
[11:40.360 --> 11:46.920]  I'm down I gotta drive I'll just get it here you know I'm like a prisoner when
[11:46.920 --> 11:49.720]  I'm doing the radio show I can't move around in here but I got it I got the
[11:49.720 --> 11:58.440]  coffee I am somewhat exhausted from New York today but I will warm up here as
[11:58.440 --> 12:07.600]  things progress we will open the phones up as I said but this whole bizarro
[12:07.600 --> 12:13.400]  world of saying we've got domestic terrorists in our county in our city
[12:13.400 --> 12:20.400]  and having this openly said shows you how far they've gone this is what I want
[12:20.400 --> 12:36.240]  to say even even if you believe 9-11 was an outside job let's say 19 Arabs from a
[12:36.240 --> 12:40.680]  cave were able to have norad stand down they did have magic passports not one
[12:40.680 --> 12:43.800]  but two that came out of their clothing through the fireball through the
[12:43.800 --> 12:48.800]  building and and we're then found on the ground within a day by the FBI in all
[12:48.800 --> 12:53.560]  of that bedlam if you believe that or you believe that cell phones were
[12:53.560 --> 12:59.680]  working at above 30,000 feet when I every time I've flown have snuck and had my
[12:59.680 --> 13:03.560]  wife on the phone or had friends on the phone and I've never gotten a phone to
[13:03.560 --> 13:07.800]  work above 5,000 feet let's say magically the hijackers not using
[13:07.800 --> 13:12.960]  air phones or or or the passengers not using air for phones or this or the
[13:12.960 --> 13:18.760]  flight attendants not using air phones that they did work at 15 20 25,000 30,000
[13:18.760 --> 13:24.000]  36,000 feet if you believe that great let's just say that's real magically the
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.120]  laws of physics were suspended that day building 7 fell in its own footprint
[13:28.120 --> 13:32.360]  magically from small fires forget the CNN footage of police saying get back
[13:32.360 --> 13:36.240]  they're gonna bring down building 7 that building's about to blow up and there
[13:36.240 --> 13:39.680]  was a 10-second countdown and it was announced on the news they were gonna
[13:39.680 --> 13:43.880]  blow it up I heard it have seen it we've got the newscast we've played them
[13:43.880 --> 13:48.480]  they're gonna bring down building 7 New Yorkers all heard it as well let's just
[13:48.480 --> 13:54.040]  forget all of that let's just say it's real okay bin Laden wasn't a CIA asset
[13:54.040 --> 14:00.200]  even though on record he was and and and let's just go along and say it was real
[14:00.200 --> 14:07.160]  for the sake of argument today okay passports came out we're found not
[14:07.160 --> 14:14.680]  damaged one of them the other slightly damaged it's real okay cell phones
[14:14.680 --> 14:20.400]  working at 30 something thousand feet real all real all true nobody's lying
[14:20.400 --> 14:25.040]  to us forget all the scripting that day within 15 minutes saying bin Laden did
[14:25.040 --> 14:28.720]  it and saying we got to go into Iraq and all the rest of it let's just forget all
[14:28.720 --> 14:33.440]  of that forget all the scripting that was evidence of the inside job forget it
[14:33.440 --> 14:40.280]  for the sake of argument let's just say bin Laden did it no one can argue and no
[14:40.280 --> 14:48.640]  one can debate that the tragic events the horrific events of 9-11 have been
[14:48.640 --> 14:53.000]  used to take our liberties and our freedoms and have been used for the
[14:53.000 --> 14:57.200]  military industrial complex which are offshore corporations that could care
[14:57.200 --> 15:05.080]  less about America have used it to put in a now in the last nine years trillion
[15:05.080 --> 15:10.720]  dollar or more it's hundreds of billions a year giant infrastructure of control
[15:10.720 --> 15:16.280]  where they profit from surveilling us and violating our rights and no one can
[15:16.280 --> 15:20.760]  deny that per state per year the Patriot Act on record it was just in the news
[15:20.760 --> 15:26.800]  again last week is used in non-terror related cases marijuana plants domestic
[15:26.800 --> 15:32.960]  violence fist fights embezzlement they're suspending the Constitution they're
[15:32.960 --> 15:38.960]  suspending due process in thousands of cases per state every year using the
[15:38.960 --> 15:44.000]  federal statute no one could deny they've gone from saying oh just five years
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.880]  ago we're not listening to you without warrants we promise that we're not
[15:47.880 --> 15:53.120]  listening to you without warrants we we promise remember Bush and those press
[15:53.120 --> 15:56.440]  conferences and then it turned out they were listening to basically everything
[15:56.440 --> 16:01.720]  in real time without warrants and it's non-terror related no one can deny that
[16:01.720 --> 16:06.040]  we're losing our freedoms no one can deny that they're training us to have
[16:06.040 --> 16:09.640]  our genitals grabbed on the outside and the inside of our pants and to be put
[16:09.640 --> 16:13.360]  in microwave ovens and the TSA and the federal government and Homeland Security
[16:13.360 --> 16:20.920]  have been caught lying about the radiation level no one can deny it and
[16:20.920 --> 16:28.840]  so let's just say 9-11 was an outside job run by people out of Afghanistan it's
[16:28.840 --> 16:32.760]  not true the facts show this the opposite but let's just for the sake of
[16:32.760 --> 16:37.960]  debate say that okay what is giving up my freedoms and my liberties due to
[16:37.960 --> 16:43.360]  protect me from that it doesn't I mean Janet Napolitano was in the news last
[16:43.360 --> 16:49.280]  week saying that it's illogical it does not make logical sense was the quote to
[16:49.280 --> 17:00.360]  profile Muslim men now 100% of the supposed terror attacks other than
[17:00.360 --> 17:05.320]  Oklahoma City you know the the big international and national attacks they
[17:05.320 --> 17:12.600]  hype 100% are supposedly Muslims so it makes no logical sense to profile them
[17:12.600 --> 17:17.320]  see it's asinine ladies and gentlemen you know we had Congress been on at the
[17:17.320 --> 17:21.440]  time we had sheriff's on we had state reps on at the time going back five
[17:21.440 --> 17:27.640]  years ago six years ago saying they're not building a fence they put giant game
[17:27.640 --> 17:32.560]  migration points through them that are five feet tall where people are allowed
[17:32.560 --> 17:36.560]  to walk through the border patrol is ordered to not stop illegals except for
[17:36.560 --> 17:41.320]  when news crews are there as part of stunts now all of that has been
[17:41.320 --> 17:47.640]  officially admitted and you find out Obama for two years has been shipping
[17:47.640 --> 17:52.000]  tens of thousands of guns knowingly allowing them to be shipped to Mexico
[17:52.000 --> 17:55.680]  so they can then try to trace them back to then blame the Second Amendment I
[17:55.680 --> 18:00.640]  mean it's just it's it's a joke our liberties are not being taken to
[18:00.640 --> 18:04.000]  protect us as Benjamin Franklin said if you give up your liberty to paraphrase
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.480]  him you don't deserve liberty or security and you're not going to get
[18:08.480 --> 18:12.800]  either when you give up liberty you don't get security and that's just common
[18:12.800 --> 18:18.720]  sense I mean who protects us from the big monolithic mega corporations that
[18:18.720 --> 18:22.800]  control our federal government and can get away with bloody murder I mean it's
[18:22.800 --> 18:27.760]  really that simple and then you get the law enforcement manuals you get the
[18:27.760 --> 18:32.440]  training manuals I talked to countless detectives and an intelligence unit
[18:32.440 --> 18:36.720]  police and then I see them quoted in the news as well and they'll admit over
[18:36.720 --> 18:44.080]  nine out of ten times their training seminars are about gun owners libertarians
[18:44.080 --> 18:49.280]  people that want to be left alone people that are growing their own crops who
[18:49.280 --> 18:53.800]  these are dirty people who they don't like the Federal Reserve they don't like
[18:53.800 --> 18:58.520]  the New World Order they want out of the UN well I'm an American I'm allowed to
[18:58.520 --> 19:02.240]  want to have a garden I'm allowed to think fluorides bad I have the proof I'm
[19:02.240 --> 19:06.880]  allowed to not like the private Federal Reserve we didn't have till 1913 I'm
[19:06.880 --> 19:11.920]  allowed to not like the IRS that we didn't have till 1913 I'm allowed to
[19:11.920 --> 19:15.320]  not like the fact that our senators are popularly elected should have been
[19:15.320 --> 19:23.720]  elected by the state legislatures I'm I'm allowed to be informed and know that
[19:23.720 --> 19:28.520]  the Tent Amendment and states rights are the secret to getting this country back
[19:28.520 --> 19:34.160]  I'm not bad because I know what America is all about and so while you're being
[19:34.160 --> 19:38.640]  told give up your rights to fight al-Qaeda when you actually get into the
[19:38.640 --> 19:44.640]  real training it's all about you and that's the paradox here the average
[19:44.640 --> 19:48.520]  hardcore conservative is a good person even if they're missing informal many
[19:48.520 --> 19:52.640]  subjects of the war on terror and while they're supporting these attacks on
[19:52.640 --> 19:57.240]  liberty to protect America they don't know behind the scenes it's all about
[19:57.240 --> 20:02.520]  them they're supporting this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about a

[24:40.640 --> 24:53.560]  familiar stain try to kill it all away but I remember but I remember everything
[24:53.560 --> 25:06.160]  I love Johnny Cash what have I become my sweetest friend my sweetest friend
[25:06.160 --> 25:24.560]  everyone I know goes away and this just at all and you could have it all my empire
[25:24.560 --> 25:41.360]  all right enough of the great one you know that's another point I want to make
[25:41.360 --> 25:44.600]  that I'm getting into all the new FBI powers all the incredible police state
[25:44.600 --> 25:51.520]  stuff you know yesterday I'm not gonna tell the story because it's
[25:51.520 --> 25:59.720]  unbelievable but it's on record I had something bad happen yesterday and when
[25:59.720 --> 26:02.600]  the police were getting ready to put the person in handcuffs I just said let him
[26:02.600 --> 26:08.000]  go even though this person was demonic horrible evil laughing at me God just
[26:08.000 --> 26:15.360]  said let him go I'm not gonna tell the story that's it I'm not talking about it
[26:15.360 --> 26:22.320]  you know the issue is that I know the system's coming after me and that's
[26:22.320 --> 26:33.920]  fine because people that are serving this corrupt system you are in the
[26:33.920 --> 26:41.880]  crosshairs just as much as I am this is a system that is insane just on the
[26:41.880 --> 26:48.880]  genetic engineering front alone with the cows that produce human breast milk and
[26:48.880 --> 26:54.440]  the monkeys that glow in the dark and have the jellyfish genes and the
[26:54.440 --> 26:59.440]  sometimes a hundred different insect genes in one plant that we're then
[26:59.440 --> 27:05.080]  eating I mean do I need to explain to you the fact that it's not a question of
[27:05.080 --> 27:09.600]  if but when we're not just gonna have increased allergies and bowel disorders
[27:09.600 --> 27:15.360]  and diabetes and cancer from these GMOs it is undoubted that it's gonna create
[27:15.360 --> 27:18.760]  super mutagens that are gonna create plagues they're gonna make the black
[27:18.760 --> 27:26.600]  plague that killed 30 to 40% of Europe look like a Sunday picnic and and where
[27:26.600 --> 27:30.120]  else do I go I have thousands of such issues to cover here and it's not my
[27:30.120 --> 27:34.320]  opinion I'm absolutely targeted on this I know what I'm talking about we're
[27:34.320 --> 27:43.160]  destroying ourselves you know I went to the talkers event and I meant to write
[27:43.160 --> 27:47.520]  some notes upon this morning and give my reflections on it it's a very important
[27:47.520 --> 27:54.720]  the most important individual insider talk radio events been going on for
[27:54.720 --> 27:59.640]  decades and Rush Limbaugh has been the keynote speaker Sean Hannity people like
[27:59.640 --> 28:03.840]  that in the past and I went and I was the keynote speaker and I was shocked to
[28:03.840 --> 28:08.560]  see congressman former congressman you know Steven Baldwin in the audience
[28:08.560 --> 28:14.360]  Fox News people I was like wow this really is high-powered and I got up
[28:14.360 --> 28:17.440]  there and you know gave him a I think an okay speech it wasn't one of my better
[28:17.440 --> 28:22.600]  ones but they put out a press release saying it was dynamite and then I was
[28:22.600 --> 28:25.840]  there with a station owner that's got me on a few other stations and he played
[28:25.840 --> 28:31.640]  me a commentary that is off his iPhone that his mother had you know had done
[28:31.640 --> 28:36.080]  about me on the radio and I looked at the guy is we were eating dinner and I
[28:36.080 --> 28:42.680]  said you think it makes me feel good that you're smart sweet old mother is it
[28:42.680 --> 28:46.880]  looks up to me and thinks I'm this great guy and has all this love for me in her
[28:46.880 --> 28:51.760]  voice I said no it makes me feel horrible he was like why do you say that
[28:51.760 --> 28:56.920]  and and it it's not that I'm ashamed of what I've done and it's not that I'm
[28:56.920 --> 29:03.400]  misleading people I'm proud of a lot of what I've done but compared to what I'm
[29:03.400 --> 29:09.160]  proud of I also am disgusted with my delivery and disgusted with who I am
[29:09.160 --> 29:14.920]  because I never expected to be in this position and to have my position of
[29:14.920 --> 29:20.000]  prominence and power growing exponentially it's it's it's it's not
[29:20.000 --> 29:27.080]  fun I'm not in and again I'm not criticizing her I'm saying a nice good
[29:27.080 --> 29:33.760]  person counting on me the responsibility of all these young people and old
[29:33.760 --> 29:38.520]  people and at the airport's families with shining eyes coming up to me looking
[29:38.520 --> 29:46.720]  at me like I I'm going to save them I mean I just I'm trying to quantify it
[29:46.720 --> 29:50.400]  when I come back I just I never knew this responsibility would feel like this
[29:50.400 --> 29:59.120]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[29:59.280 --> 30:03.240]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[30:03.240 --> 30:07.600]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[30:07.600 --> 30:11.760]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[30:11.760 --> 30:15.800]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[30:15.800 --> 30:19.720]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[30:19.720 --> 30:23.840]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[30:23.840 --> 30:28.160]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[30:28.160 --> 30:32.440]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[30:32.440 --> 30:36.160]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[30:36.160 --> 30:40.360]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[30:40.360 --> 30:43.760]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[32:05.000 --> 32:09.520]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[32:09.520 --> 32:13.480]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[32:13.480 --> 32:18.160]  turned a menace influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[32:18.160 --> 32:22.800]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[32:22.800 --> 32:27.160]  citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our
[32:27.160 --> 32:32.400]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[32:32.400 --> 32:36.720]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[32:36.720 --> 32:40.200]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[32:40.200 --> 32:45.440]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[32:45.440 --> 32:51.360]  have seen a fall of the Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at
[32:51.360 --> 32:56.360]  info wars.com we're watching online right now in super high quality at
[32:56.360 --> 33:07.080]  prisonplanet.tv you are obsolete mr. Wordsworth lie no man is obsolete you
[33:07.080 --> 33:11.360]  have no function mr. Wordsworth you're an anachronism like a ghost from another
[33:11.360 --> 33:16.200]  time I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by
[33:16.200 --> 33:21.360]  burning pages you're a bug mr. Wordsworth a crawling insect ugly
[33:21.360 --> 33:26.120]  misforn little creature who has no purpose here no meaning I am a human
[33:26.120 --> 33:33.480]  being words mr. Wordsworth that have no substance and no dimension like air like
[33:33.480 --> 33:40.200]  a wind I don't care I tell you I don't care I'm a human being I exist if I
[33:40.200 --> 33:46.040]  speak one for a lot that lives even after I'm shoveled in my grave
[33:46.040 --> 33:53.320]  delusions mr. Wordsworth delusions that you inject into your veins to make you
[33:53.320 --> 33:57.640]  think you have a strength but you have no strength at all you have nothing but
[33:57.640 --> 34:04.880]  spindly limbs and a dream and the state has no use for your kind resistance to
[34:04.880 --> 34:11.760]  tyrants his obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[34:11.760 --> 34:17.880]  all right you tune into this broadcast for the history the philosophy the guest
[34:17.880 --> 34:30.480]  the news but really trying to quantify what I was getting into earlier I it's
[34:30.480 --> 34:35.720]  really simply this to have so many people counting on me to have so many
[34:35.720 --> 34:40.560]  people looking up to me I just see myself as a fighter against tyranny I
[34:40.560 --> 34:45.640]  see myself as someone who wants to be free but then in my own humanness I know
[34:45.640 --> 34:51.720]  I make mistakes I know I fail just as many times as I succeed and then I
[34:51.720 --> 34:56.600]  realize that people are looking up to me I've got to do an even better job and I
[34:56.600 --> 35:02.560]  see my own weak frail humanness and I realize I don't have the answers or or
[35:02.560 --> 35:09.760]  or all the answers or or enough energy to ever deliver things perfectly to
[35:09.760 --> 35:18.640]  people or anywhere close to it and it's just it's quite an experience it is
[35:18.640 --> 35:27.520]  quite an experience in the final final equation to constantly see so many
[35:27.520 --> 35:35.480]  people looking up to me because I think what if I make a mistake what if I let
[35:35.480 --> 35:43.760]  the enemy destroy me what if what if everything then you know begins to be
[35:43.760 --> 35:47.800]  about Alex Jones in the fight against tyranny instead of the fight against
[35:47.800 --> 35:55.160]  tyranny then I can be destroyed politically or physically and then they
[35:55.160 --> 36:00.520]  can tell never lies they want that's the thing it's the realization that even
[36:00.520 --> 36:06.040]  if I do the very best job I can the system will just make stuff up or the
[36:06.040 --> 36:11.120]  system will take things and twist them and then try to hurt our movement for
[36:11.120 --> 36:17.800]  free humanity through that it's just the continued awakening to the fact that
[36:17.800 --> 36:23.160]  with great power comes great responsibility I go back to one of the
[36:23.160 --> 36:26.200]  spider-man movies I saw I haven't seen them all I've seen one of them but it's
[36:26.200 --> 36:31.320]  the one where where they don't pay him his money after he's been wrestling and
[36:31.320 --> 36:37.240]  he's just beaten you know the other wrestler and he goes in the back room
[36:37.240 --> 36:40.440]  and says give me my money and they cheat him he's saying ah kid you didn't read
[36:40.440 --> 36:46.960]  the fine print and a guy comes in and robs him and he has a chance to stop him
[36:46.960 --> 36:52.840]  but he doesn't stop the robber and and the robber says thanks kid and runs out
[36:52.840 --> 36:59.040]  on the street and then kills his uncle car jacks his uncle that was there to
[36:59.040 --> 37:06.520]  pick him up and then he sees oh my gosh I thought I was doing something evil to
[37:06.520 --> 37:10.880]  get back at somebody but it came right back on me see I'm actually aware that
[37:10.880 --> 37:15.480]  that's how the universe works and so I constantly try to be moral I constantly
[37:15.480 --> 37:20.440]  try to be good I constantly try to be upstanding I constantly try to get it
[37:20.440 --> 37:26.000]  right but I'm human like everybody else and then in hindsight days later weeks
[37:26.000 --> 37:29.760]  later years later I will see things I've done that weren't accurate completely
[37:29.760 --> 37:34.520]  or things that weren't right or times I lost my temper or times I was worldly
[37:34.520 --> 37:42.200]  or arrogant or overly competitive and it's it's really the horror of realizing
[37:42.200 --> 37:47.560]  that I'm falling just like everybody else on this planet and then there's the
[37:47.560 --> 37:55.600]  pain of seeing other people who are 10 20 30 40 times more worldly more corrupt
[37:55.600 --> 38:00.600]  than I am who they want to be corrupt they think it's good they've completely
[38:00.600 --> 38:06.400]  given themselves over to it and I don't even hate those people anymore I'm not
[38:06.400 --> 38:10.240]  even angry at them anymore before I hated them was angry at them and that was
[38:10.240 --> 38:16.280]  somewhat of a psychological shield now I'm more just depressed by it but then I
[38:16.280 --> 38:24.480]  see all the positive good things in the world and I think about how good people
[38:24.480 --> 38:30.200]  are if we could just get the good kind-hearted loving intelligent people
[38:30.200 --> 38:34.960]  out there who don't see themselves as leaders to see themselves as leaders if
[38:34.960 --> 38:40.520]  there are people out there listening to this broadcast right now that if you got
[38:40.520 --> 38:45.080]  involved in the media if you got involved in warning people if you started
[38:45.080 --> 38:49.320]  an access television show if you went and got a local weekend radio show and
[38:49.320 --> 38:55.360]  if you organized and turned loose your passion and got involved and and and
[38:55.360 --> 38:59.440]  didn't get tied down by in-fighting and Cointel pro that you would be able to do
[38:59.440 --> 39:06.400]  things much greater than I've done and it's that potential humanity has a
[39:06.400 --> 39:12.400]  potential to reach the stars not reach for the stars reach the stars and we
[39:12.400 --> 39:18.640]  also have the potential to drag civilization into absolute hell and
[39:18.640 --> 39:24.880]  every form of avarice and corruption and degeneracy is being turned loose when
[39:24.880 --> 39:30.000]  I go on trips and I see the public and I travel and I listen to people and I watch
[39:30.000 --> 39:37.360]  them it is such a amalgamation of decadence and sullenness and entitlement
[39:37.360 --> 39:43.640]  and corruption and and and people obsessed with diversions I mean I see it
[39:43.640 --> 39:50.080]  all and I see humanity being sucked downward but the same time I see other
[39:50.080 --> 39:55.320]  people rising so so it's a it's a spectrum it's not just humanity sinking
[39:55.320 --> 40:01.360]  it's hills and valleys some people are rising others are sinking and it's a
[40:01.360 --> 40:05.720]  battle going on there is at the end of the day there is a battle of good and
[40:05.720 --> 40:09.600]  evil we wouldn't have a private fellow reserve running our society we wouldn't
[40:09.600 --> 40:15.240]  have a society dominated by lies and deception if good people hadn't slowly
[40:15.240 --> 40:20.240]  been seduced by it by degrees to accept it is what I'm saying so more and more
[40:20.240 --> 40:26.520]  it's the philosophy of liberty versus tyranny that dominates culture and but
[40:26.520 --> 40:30.600]  you have to be able to recognize what is liberty what is tyranny what is good
[40:30.600 --> 40:35.960]  what is evil and more and more it is the ability to recognize reality that will
[40:35.960 --> 40:40.440]  save our society or doom it as Winston Smith being tortured in the fictional
[40:40.440 --> 40:47.120]  1984 says freedom is the power to say two plus two equals four and and that
[40:47.120 --> 40:50.720]  sounds ridiculous you're like well I can say two plus two equals four can you
[40:50.720 --> 40:55.360]  say two plus two equals four or do you sit there like the BBC did when they
[40:55.360 --> 40:59.440]  were here a few weeks ago I haven't even talked about this and I'm in the
[40:59.440 --> 41:05.560]  interview with the guy and I was very depressed after the interview and I
[41:05.560 --> 41:10.000]  wanted to get out of the interview not because I after the show not because I
[41:10.000 --> 41:15.080]  couldn't answer the questions I didn't want to be in the presence of the person
[41:15.080 --> 41:21.920]  I sat there and I see he had all his little 9-11 questions that he was all
[41:21.920 --> 41:25.480]  prepared for and and you know things that were honeypots things that couldn't
[41:25.480 --> 41:31.480]  be proven one way or the other and I would say well what about the the magic
[41:31.480 --> 41:34.640]  passports coming out of the planes and then in the down the ground and then
[41:34.640 --> 41:38.760]  being found I mean that's impossible on both counts it's impossible they would
[41:38.760 --> 41:42.200]  survive unharmed but it's it's near impossible they would be immediately
[41:42.200 --> 41:46.760]  found I mean do you see how convenient that is and I said you notice they don't
[41:46.760 --> 41:51.720]  use that anymore in fact within a few weeks they quit using that in the
[41:51.720 --> 41:55.920]  media because it was so ridiculous people were like what I mean even the
[41:55.920 --> 41:59.960]  dumb-down public didn't buy that and the guy just giggled at me and smiled with
[41:59.960 --> 42:03.520]  a twinkle and said I do believe it and right then I realized this is a
[42:03.520 --> 42:08.680]  mercenary this guy could care less he could care less what the truth is he
[42:08.680 --> 42:16.120]  was a cold-blooded mercenary and I had a desire to do something you know I mean
[42:16.120 --> 42:22.280]  and because I knew see if I'm confronted with some gutter-snipe level
[42:22.280 --> 42:26.560]  decadent person that's turned himself over to the world but but but but just
[42:26.560 --> 42:29.880]  thinks that that's what life is then I feel sorry for him but when I'm
[42:29.880 --> 42:41.800]  confronted with someone who knows and thinks this stuff's funny you think I
[42:41.800 --> 42:47.080]  want to come on air and say 9-11's an inside job do you think my ego wanted
[42:47.080 --> 42:53.560]  to lose two-thirds the affiliates I had nine years ago when 9-11 took place we
[42:53.560 --> 42:59.160]  were over a hundred stations we've just now gone over a hundred since then and
[42:59.160 --> 43:02.480]  Ted Anderson didn't censor me great guy that he is but he would come in and say
[43:02.480 --> 43:05.440]  well yeah these stations are gonna turn you off if you don't stop talking about
[43:05.440 --> 43:12.160]  it I'd say I can't stop that's it okay but see to for me it's not that I'm
[43:12.160 --> 43:17.120]  some great wonderful moral person that I can't compromise that I can't sell out
[43:17.120 --> 43:21.680]  consciously my fear is is I'll make mistakes and end up selling out even
[43:21.680 --> 43:32.720]  if I don't try by degrees and here I am nine years later more successful than
[43:32.720 --> 43:41.600]  I've ever been at getting the word out to people and well you know I rarely get
[43:41.600 --> 43:46.800]  up here and you know actually engage in open soul searching on the air so I
[43:46.800 --> 43:49.600]  know this makes a lot of sense to some people doesn't make sense to other
[43:49.600 --> 43:56.840]  people I'm just being a hundred percent real with you and I wish every day a lot
[43:56.840 --> 44:04.400]  of times I wake up at like 3 4 in the morning with my heart pounding wishing
[44:04.400 --> 44:11.960]  that 9-11 wasn't an inside job and not because I have I've had to be demonized
[44:11.960 --> 44:16.280]  and attacked and ridiculed and scorned and been a heretic for telling the
[44:16.280 --> 44:20.440]  truth no no no I wake up the middle of the night because it's scary that it's
[44:20.440 --> 44:25.040]  an inside job I know why people are repulsed by it why people run from it
[44:25.040 --> 44:29.720]  because yeah believe me I want to run from it too but you can't run from it
[44:29.720 --> 44:34.280]  if it isn't inside job what does that say about the system that runs our
[44:34.280 --> 44:38.200]  country what does that say about how much trouble we're in oh believe me I
[44:38.200 --> 44:44.000]  know why you don't want to face that fact because it is frightening it is
[44:44.000 --> 44:51.680]  nauseating it is terrifying it screams danger danger danger danger danger
[44:51.680 --> 44:58.000]  danger at will Robinson but all of you in your gut are you more afraid of the
[44:58.000 --> 45:03.440]  turban men with the big beards if they were all gone tomorrow would you be at
[45:03.440 --> 45:08.200]  peace no you wouldn't be everybody knows in their gut and intellectually who the
[45:08.200 --> 45:13.320]  threat is it's the government but that's an oversimplification the government's
[45:13.320 --> 45:16.520]  made of people just like you and I it's the people running it it's the
[45:16.520 --> 45:20.400]  philosophy it's the captain I'm not worried about the guy in engineering
[45:20.400 --> 45:23.720]  running the boilers I'm not worried about the person up on the top deck
[45:23.720 --> 45:27.320]  busing tables I'm not worried about the bartender I'm not worried about the lady
[45:27.320 --> 45:30.760]  that that changes the beds I'm not worried about the people that are
[45:30.760 --> 45:33.800]  working in the galley I'm not worried about the doctor I'm not worried about
[45:33.800 --> 45:39.360]  the dentist and the cruise ship I'm worried about the captain and his inner
[45:39.360 --> 45:44.760]  crew are a bunch of murderous scum who write books about how much they want to
[45:44.760 --> 45:48.160]  set up world government and exterminate us and they publish the books they
[45:48.160 --> 45:52.040]  constantly talk about it the White House science are on and on and on Ted
[45:52.040 --> 45:56.880]  Turner Prince Philip all of them and I'm here saying folks we're in trouble
[45:56.880 --> 46:00.000]  they're like well our government wouldn't do that our government's been
[46:00.000 --> 46:05.840]  taken over I'll use another analogy if you were on board a plane this has
[46:05.840 --> 46:09.440]  happened a lot of times in history and because hijackers there've been real
[46:09.440 --> 46:15.120]  hijackers in history real terrorists real political activists that think
[46:15.120 --> 46:18.320]  they're doing this to draw attention to something but they are going after
[46:18.320 --> 46:23.040]  men women and children which in the code of ethics in war is disgusting and
[46:23.040 --> 46:27.160]  filthy and bad them in the modern time they call it terrorist but whether it's
[46:27.160 --> 46:33.120]  bombing Dresden or bombing London or bombing Tokyo or killing men women and
[46:33.120 --> 46:38.520]  children by anybody it's a war crime it's against humanity the rules are you
[46:38.520 --> 46:47.400]  don't touch women and children and what happens is I start going down one path
[46:47.400 --> 46:52.760]  while I'm talking and I forget what the original point was why was I I was not
[46:52.760 --> 46:55.440]  getting off into that
[46:57.280 --> 47:05.840]  well I remember Rush Limbaugh a few months ago he was talking about the
[47:05.840 --> 47:10.320]  Rolling Stone articles where you know they're killing innocent people shooting
[47:10.320 --> 47:15.280]  innocent people in Afghanistan and he said oh well the army is not doing a
[47:15.280 --> 47:20.480]  good job we played the clip he goes I agree with Rolling Stone in the media but
[47:20.480 --> 47:26.680]  not in the way they think the army is saying we're sorry we're accidentally
[47:26.680 --> 47:29.760]  killing innocent people and Limbaugh said well there used to be a time in this
[47:29.760 --> 47:35.600]  country when we wanted to kill everybody and that's how we won bombing Dresden
[47:35.600 --> 47:43.440]  in Germany bombing Tokyo bombing Hiroshima bombing Nagasaki he said you
[47:43.440 --> 47:50.800]  know there was a time in America when we wanted to kill women and children and I
[47:50.800 --> 47:54.840]  just listened to that like like some men think it's tough to talk about killing
[47:54.840 --> 48:03.680]  women and children you see once you get rid of those rules once you get rid of
[48:03.680 --> 48:11.360]  those rules then everybody's fair game and I thought about how people think it's
[48:11.360 --> 48:16.000]  manly to be for torture and secret arrest they think it's tough they think
[48:16.000 --> 48:22.480]  it's cool they think it's sexy and it's not you know other civilizations time and
[48:22.480 --> 48:26.160]  time again have figured out that that's against the rules because really bad
[48:26.160 --> 48:31.840]  things happen if men want to march off and kill each other that's one thing but
[48:31.840 --> 48:35.520]  no the United States up until World War two never acted like that and never
[48:35.520 --> 48:47.240]  behaved like that and so now we're told well we should behave like that again and
[48:47.240 --> 48:55.280]  that somehow that's tough but then we're told if Arabs target us the same way but
[48:55.280 --> 49:00.600]  not with 2,000 pound bombs dropped on villages but with bombs strapped to
[49:00.600 --> 49:05.400]  themselves their cowards their terrorist their bad their evil oh my gosh it's
[49:05.400 --> 49:10.520]  horrible oh my gosh Gaddafi might have shot some protesters so let's invade but
[49:10.520 --> 49:15.080]  it's not an invasion but oh my gosh Israel just mowed down a bunch of people
[49:15.080 --> 49:19.000]  that's a good thing to do whether you're for Israel doing that or not just don't
[49:19.000 --> 49:29.040]  give me your schizophrenic double-think hypocritical line about how you care
[49:29.040 --> 49:32.920]  about humanity and you care about individuals and you care about not
[49:32.920 --> 49:42.320]  killing civilians that's the point I'm getting it but up until World War two our
[49:42.320 --> 49:45.920]  government didn't do that and certainly Hitler was a bad warmonger and did attack
[49:45.920 --> 49:53.360]  civilians cities when he invaded Poland other areas but with the British he
[49:53.360 --> 49:58.520]  targeted military bases first in the Blitz and then the British flew in a
[49:58.520 --> 50:05.680]  big Saudi of aircraft and bomber Lynn and civilian targets and it was later
[50:05.680 --> 50:10.000]  declassified they did that knowing that Hitler would then turn his attack on to
[50:10.000 --> 50:15.080]  the civilian cities and not the military bases and they also in the reports
[50:15.080 --> 50:18.440]  said that within and their psychological research would get the British fully
[50:18.440 --> 50:26.880]  behind the war when they were targeted and so then the rest is history Germany
[50:26.880 --> 50:32.320]  was completely leveled more than 20 million Germans died and Hitler was
[50:32.320 --> 50:38.640]  played like a fiddle five hundred thousand people died what in one week of
[50:38.640 --> 50:45.960]  bombing on Dresden which was quote a safe city for the children so I don't
[50:45.960 --> 50:50.120]  care if it's a black African child a German child whoever it is in war this
[50:50.120 --> 50:53.480]  because you're fighting with somebody's daddy doesn't mean you kill their two
[50:53.480 --> 50:58.120]  year old baby well they're right back stay with us

[54:17.280 --> 54:22.120]  what I was really getting at earlier I think it's summation is that we're all
[54:22.120 --> 54:27.080]  in individual struggles with ourselves to decide what do we stand for who all
[54:27.080 --> 54:32.680]  are we what is our cultural values and the American cultural values and it's
[54:32.680 --> 54:36.120]  not that the United States has ever been perfect but the American cultural values
[54:36.120 --> 54:41.920]  what America stood for what made this country great is under assault anyone
[54:41.920 --> 54:46.680]  who studied basic history common sense knows that whether it's Republicans or
[54:46.680 --> 54:51.440]  Democrats at the end of the day we're losing everything that was good about
[54:51.440 --> 54:56.520]  this country when this nation's going in the wrong direction and lies have become
[54:56.520 --> 55:02.960]  the norm not just Wiener gate or Bill Clinton lying or George W. Bush lying
[55:02.960 --> 55:08.280]  about WMDs or his dad lying about read my lips known to taxes but but but a lot
[55:08.280 --> 55:14.960]  bigger lies the not so dominant old line media the dying media the dying
[55:14.960 --> 55:20.440]  corporate media loves to focus on a Wiener gate loves to focus on something
[55:20.440 --> 55:24.760]  that's individualized at one person that doesn't indict the whole system for its
[55:24.760 --> 55:31.520]  lies but our fundamental monetary system has been a lie for 97 plus years it'll
[55:31.520 --> 55:43.560]  be 100 years coming up in 2013 19 13 2013 and it's a fact of this monetary
[55:43.560 --> 55:47.680]  system that for every dollar created a dollar of debt is created and we are to
[55:47.680 --> 55:52.000]  pay that debt to who the private Federal Reserve and we're now coming to the end
[55:52.000 --> 55:56.280]  of the cycle we've now had our wealth stolen we've had our buying power stolen
[55:56.280 --> 56:00.320]  we've been deindustrialized we were told NAFTA and GATT would be great that
[56:00.320 --> 56:03.640]  Walmart would be wonderful Walmart's profits are plunging I was just reading
[56:03.640 --> 56:08.280]  an article yesterday where they're now gonna roll out with small local stores
[56:08.280 --> 56:13.040]  trying to put what's left out of business because their big box business is
[56:13.040 --> 56:19.160]  falling apart but that's a necessary process of what Walmart's done of what
[56:19.160 --> 56:24.480]  Chinese slave goods have done is that at the end it Walmart destroys itself but
[56:24.480 --> 56:27.360]  the people running it don't care because they will always move on to the next
[56:27.360 --> 56:29.880]  country which they admit they're doing that's what they're doing their main
[56:29.880 --> 56:34.640]  investments now outside the US even though the US is over 60% of their total
[56:34.640 --> 56:39.480]  global profit so they're done they've mined us out there was no attitude of
[56:39.480 --> 56:43.560]  build-up America it was just oh we've got big American flags hanging up made
[56:43.560 --> 56:47.640]  America buy America and then you can't find American in there but people think
[56:47.640 --> 56:50.920]  they're buying American because there's big American flags up everywhere and I
[56:50.920 --> 56:56.000]  think that jingoism symbolizes the curse that we're under and I'm not even
[56:56.000 --> 57:00.160]  just going after Walmart here that there's American flags everywhere but
[57:00.160 --> 57:05.240]  even the American flags hanging on the wall are made in China so you feel good
[57:05.240 --> 57:12.360]  while you're there buying the stuff at Walmart but it's all a lie and a lie
[57:12.360 --> 57:21.000]  will get you hurt okay look I've been ranting and we do have dominating batting
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.960]  a member of the Swiss Parliament coming on incredibly positive historical
[57:24.960 --> 57:28.320]  things happened at Bilderberg and I think what I was getting to earlier is I
[57:28.320 --> 57:32.000]  don't even feel worthy to even cover things that are this important and all
[57:32.000 --> 57:35.600]  the subtle intricacies a lot of times when I leave the show at the end of the
[57:35.600 --> 57:38.960]  day I I feel terrible I feel like I should have made these points I should
[57:38.960 --> 57:47.880]  have made that point and it's because I have an intense desire to warn people an
[57:47.880 --> 57:52.360]  intense desire to turn things around an intense desire to not go down the road
[57:52.360 --> 57:56.720]  we're going down and I get frustrated by seeing people who have no desire to be
[57:56.720 --> 58:01.840]  informed no desire to be involved in society no desire to be players on the
[58:01.840 --> 58:07.760]  field they just want to be spectators but the good news at the end of the day is
[58:07.760 --> 58:12.680]  this it's never been a majority that engages in evil and takes over it's
[58:12.680 --> 58:16.760]  never been a majority that defeats the evil it's always a minority on the side
[58:16.760 --> 58:22.880]  of evil and a minority on the side of good that are able to either take over
[58:22.880 --> 58:28.120]  for bad or take over for good all right tons of news coming up on a host of
[58:28.120 --> 58:32.520]  issues video clips a guest and I will give the phone number out later talk

[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:32.640]  it feels like an avalanche of news and information and that's because that's
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:40.200]  what it is everything is going into high gear right now and I was going over
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:45.000]  the new FBI manual where they say they're going to put surveillance teams on
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.080]  anybody they want without even probable cause dig through household trash that's
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:54.280]  a violation of the Fourth Amendment plant tracker chips on your cars you name it
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:58.720]  and it's called the domestic investigations operations guide and we
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:02.520]  have that dovetail I'm going to cover this coming up the next segment with
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:07.120]  bandera County Sheriff's Office issues domestic terrorism warning law
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:11.200]  enforcement agency concerned radical anti-government groups may be moving into
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:14.560]  the area that means Americans that are awake that the feds have set up spy
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:18.520]  centers and are engaging in all sorts of crimes and the government's run by
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:21.760]  foreign banks they're looting us if you try to warn people they're gonna start
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:25.320]  coming out now and trying to imply your terrorist and they're announcing now hey
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:29.240]  we're calling you terrorists we're gonna spy on you so you get scared it's an
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:32.920]  intimidation we're in the right we're the good guys we understand the crimes
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:37.080]  that have been committed and they're now kicking into high gear shifting out
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:41.400]  of hey the police states for al-qaeda to know it's for you people that like Ron
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:46.000]  Paul doesn't matter Ron Paul last election cycle and now I'm told it started
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.080]  up this election cycle is getting the largest percentage of military donations
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:55.680]  of anybody else like three years ago he got the majority of military donations
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:00.120]  not just the largest percentage in the aggregate so the good news is the cops
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:03.520]  and military are really waking up and we're in a war right now to reach them
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:09.200]  and wake them up so that's coming up and I have the bandera county press release
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:15.200]  and this is really really dangerous stuff so they're getting ready your
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:18.560]  your Amish you're trying to live on a farm you're trying to be left alone you
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:22.480]  want to kill cops I mean that's basically the message that they're telling
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:26.160]  police and then the cops will start persecuting people and then it will
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:30.200]  become a self-fulfilling prophecy let's not let the globalist play us ladies
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:35.600]  and gentlemen okay they know what they're doing but I did get chills reading
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:40.360]  this report out of the st. Libby SL Tribune I believe that's the st. Louis
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:45.960]  Tribune that's the New York Times republished in SL Treb and we're gonna
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:52.720]  be going over that report it's also MSNBC FBI agents at leeway to push
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:57.720]  privacy bounds and also in the aftermath of that story when talking about the
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:03.680]  aftermath of Bilderberg 2011 also right on time as I've been telling you in the
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:07.560]  last year every time they try to pass the cyber security act in the last four
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:10.960]  years now or is it three there's massive cyber attacks right when they're
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:15.120]  trying to pass it and Europe's trying to put government control hubs over the
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:21.000]  entire infrastructure in Europe so it's also happening there just like they've
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.360]  now had the genetically engineered E. Coli outbreak in Europe coming to the
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:28.040]  US and they of course have reintroduced the food safety act written by big
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:32.840]  agra who's generally the culprit in most major problems in the food chain if you
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:37.480]  look up past cases so they can start shutting down their competition so the
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:44.200]  monopoly men are working in overdrive right now we'll also get into all the
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:49.760]  Middle East news and some of the good news stocks open higher after six down
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:55.520]  weeks CNBCs reporting then some really bad news from CNBC US is even worse
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:59.360]  shape financially than Greece Gross says they had a PIMCO that's one of the
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:03.080]  biggest brokerage firms out there but he talks about being in worse shape with
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:09.280]  14.3 trillion in debt even USA Today last week had to admit it's 60 what they
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:14.240]  say 64 trillion is not you know not the current what's owed but if you look just
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:19.240]  right out after the next year it's 60 plus but then if you count all the
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:23.120]  derivatives that we've been forced to sign on it's 600 plus trillion
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:25.800]  domestically according to the Washington Post and I agree with those
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:29.160]  numbers because we've had other economists on previous to their analysis
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:33.560]  saying that and globally it's over 1.5 quadrillion so once you start talking
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:39.040]  about numbers like this yeah the US is in bad shape because we bought into
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:44.560]  fractional reserve banking which always ends in hyperinflation and debt
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:48.400]  defaults and the Chinese of course on Friday came out and said the United
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:53.280]  States is already technically defaulting that they're not officially doing it but
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:57.720]  they're doing it by means of hyperinflation which will now come home
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:00.720]  to roost here domestically we'll be right back
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:05.400]  hi folks this is Alex Jones I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot

[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:50.600]  Bilderberg security to take legal action so it happened they marched on it we're
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:54.920]  going to be breaking all of the huge developments down and why this is such a
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:09:00.280]  big deal and the fact that globally the dam is officially broken on media
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:04.760]  cover-ups dinosaur media cover-ups of Bilderberg at the very tip top of the
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:09.440]  global government pyramid these are the people setting the nightmare planetary
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:13.760]  agenda known as the New World Order so that's coming up but right now let me
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:19.720]  get into this report as we start the second hour here and this of course is
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:23.800]  one of the top stories up on drudge it's also up on infowars.com and
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:29.720]  prisonplanet.com FBI expands agents investigative power well that doesn't
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:34.760]  sound too scary does it and they have a link to the new manual here and it goes
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:39.520]  on at the federal Bureau of Investigation is given significant new powers in a
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:46.200]  manual it's not a law it's just a manual in its roughly 14,000 agents and all
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:51.960]  their auxiliary spies allowing them more leeway to search databases that means
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:55.720]  your computer without warrants go through household trash you you heard
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:10:00.800]  that right or use surveillance teams to scrutinize and that's the million
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:05.520]  private contractors they hire oh it's private teams yeah or go through
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:11.640]  household trash or use surveillance teams to scrutinize the lives of people
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:20.000]  who have attracted their attention and it goes on to say no judge no jury no
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.080]  probable cause just if they feel like it and of course the Patriot Act says
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:27.360]  sneak and peek where they break in your house and you never know they were there
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:32.240]  digging through your trash breaking in your house no reason to do it that is the
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:37.280]  Stasi that's as bad as it gets wasn't even routine in the Soviet Russia but the
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:40.480]  East Germans did it and who did the Homeland Security hire eight years ago
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:45.240]  Marcus Wolf two years in a row million-dollar contract one point one
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:48.520]  million each year and I first heard about that eight and a half years ago I
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:52.400]  didn't believe it and I went in and looked up the federal funding order that
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:57.360]  was public and like Houston Chronicle reported when when Halliburton got three
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:02.080]  one million man camp contracts for FEMA camps in America for American
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:07.160]  citizens Houston Chronicle right there in the federal purchase directives
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:11.960]  where putting bids out for it Halliburton got it it continues the FBI soon
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:16.040]  plans to issue the new edition of its manual called the domestic investigations
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:20.000]  and operation guide according to an official not a servant an official who
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.320]  has worked on the draft document and several others and they have sections
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:28.320]  of it here who have been briefed on its contents the new rules add to several
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:33.560]  measures taken over the past decade to give agents more latitude as they search
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:39.640]  for signs search for signs pre-crime as they search for signs of criminal or
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:44.180]  terrorist activity not oh we're getting a bite on the line now we investigate no
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:47.780]  just no more fourth amendment after all the TSA's taking their hands down your
[01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:55.080]  pants we're just going to do this the FBI recently briefed several privacy
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:59.520]  advocates about the coming changes among them Michael German a former FBI agent
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:04.920]  who is now a lawyer for the American civil civil liberties union argued it was
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:10.120]  unwise to further ease restrictions on agents power to use potentially
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:14.840]  intrusive techniques especially if they lacked a firm reason to suspect someone
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:20.720]  of wrongdoing and they also do public intimidation you you have an anti-war
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:25.280]  rally in Austin scores of people and some of them videotaped it FBI just come
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:30.440]  the door and say why were you at that rally against the war are you planning
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:32.760]  to do something bad you know any terrorists and they're like no I'm
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:37.640]  against the war then I went later and saw footage of the rally just anti-war
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:40.360]  rally they're like well we're here to talk to you about why you went to an
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:46.600]  anti-war rally do you know about any terrorist plans can we come in and it's
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:50.960]  all meant to scare you and folks if America gives into this fear they know
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:55.000]  that teachers stormed the Texas Capitol two weeks ago we stormed it days before
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  that they followed our example we followed the Wisconsin example on
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.440]  whatever political side of the paradigm you are the system wants to scare you the
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:08.280]  system wants a chilling effect and if you give into that it's over
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:13.120]  continuing here the long dark night begins folks if you like oh I better not
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:18.320]  talk about freedom the ADL will attack me I I better not talk about the
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:22.600]  Constitution or how I like Ron Paul folks we are the majority of people that
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:27.440]  are active in the country we're not the majority of Americans but of people
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:32.320]  awaken active politically every metric shows what they call a super patriot is
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:36.960]  just an American I'm pro-gun I'm pro-family I'm pro-private property I'm
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:40.760]  against the private Federal Reserve oh you're evil well you know what 85% of
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:45.240]  Americans in major polls want to abolish or audit the Fed so I guess well
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:49.440]  that they call you kooks and conspiracy theorists if you think that the
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:53.200]  government may have been involved in killing JFK well over 90% the average
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:56.880]  polls so go ahead and tell us we're dangerous terrorist we're the majority
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:02.680]  we're on the right your buffalo job your intimidation job isn't gonna work and
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:07.720]  it goes on planning additional theories to investigate people only further
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:11.800]  raises the potential for abuse Fairman said pointing to complaints about the
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:16.120]  Bureau surveillance of domestic political advocacy groups like Ron Paul no
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:24.640]  Ron Paul has been by the Army and by the FBI I mean Ron Paul himself how dare
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:29.720]  you know the 75 year old doctor man he's he's evil we got to watch him he's
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:37.040]  actually a real American and he went on to point out the fact that they targeted
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:41.840]  mosque I notice how the media always says mosque because political correctness
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:46.240]  still allows people to to to go after Muslims so the idea is who they're a
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:50.400]  real threat you know let the FBI go out for the Muslims the point is again over
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:54.640]  90% of this stuff is for gun owners conservatives libertarians regardless of
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:15:02.160]  your religious bent it goes on some of the most notable changes apply to the
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:07.720]  lowest category of investigations called an assessment the category created in
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:12.720]  December of 08 allows agents because they have a manual that says so to look
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:17.480]  into people and organizations proactively and without firm evidence for
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:24.120]  suspecting criminal or terrorist activity and this is the FBI and churches
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:32.280]  this is the FBI going to the land rights organizations or FBI going to gun
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:36.280]  rights rallies and I've been at these and it's obviously an FBI agent it's the
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:40.640]  classic type six foot four clean cut looks like Clark Kent and they go Alex
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:44.960]  come here Alex you want to attack cops with me tomorrow and I'm like are you
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:48.760]  with the FBI or are you a federal marshal you guys have assessed me years
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:53.760]  ago you know I'm not planning anything violent I mean it was your bosses stage
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:57.600]  Oklahoma city and that's what I tell them I go I'm not gonna blow things up
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:03.240]  like your bosses did I didn't test that rider truck six months before at the BAT
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:09.560]  FE testing range in New Mexico I didn't test the rider truck like they did I
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:13.160]  didn't get the warning to go to work that day like your people did and then
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:16.600]  you'll kind of shake them up I'll go oh you know about that don't you no don't
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:20.840]  worry I'm not gonna blow anything up like you are hey get over here camera guy
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:27.120]  we're gonna follow this guy they're like boom out of there no no I'm not doing
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:33.680]  that okay I'm sorry I did I don't target daycares like you like your bosses do
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:38.040]  and like your bosses are getting ready to do again I don't put out multiple
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:42.800]  White House advisor memos and then put it out to Democratic fundraisers in
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:47.240]  in letters saying that Alex Jones and Glenn Beck are gonna cause a new
[01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:51.280]  Oklahoma City and even Glenn Beck had to come out and say they're preparing to
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:54.320]  blame me Glenn Beck for the new Oklahoma City and then he played the
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:58.560]  clips or they said it'd be so great if we had a new Oklahoma City that sure
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:03.600]  helped us last time gee can't we have another one please please Obama they
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:07.100]  think we're so dumb that in the financial times of London and public
[01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:13.560]  memos they multiple top Democratic strategists say if Obama doesn't have a
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:21.960]  big terror attack like like Oklahoma City he's he's done I mean I have to sit
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:26.400]  here and watch these people getting ready to do what they're gonna do so they
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:30.280]  convince say well I heard those people didn't like the fellow reserve but you
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:34.840]  know after they blew up the Chicago Tower or whatever they're planning you
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:40.480]  know after that happened we just gee we just can't talk about about the
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:45.400]  banksters anymore it's the only card they've got and the point I'm getting to
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:50.240]  here is they're getting ready to roll out publicly what's been going on since
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:54.880]  and before 9-11 that this whole anti-terror apparatus is for real
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:59.240]  Americans people that really know what it is to be an American people that
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:05.480]  really stand for true freedom people who are opposed to the criminal corporate
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:12.160]  takeover of America of the Republic it's happened they're looting us we're
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:16.440]  waking up we're saying we don't like it and they're gonna stage terror attacks
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:22.360]  it's the only card they got to blame it on us and I'm risking my life here to
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:26.400]  bring you this information and to tell you this information yeah this is not
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:31.800]  fun this is survival this is doing the right thing you're like well you said
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:37.880]  it's dangerous how's it survival not for me you see I'm not perfect but I've got
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:42.800]  that basic instinct of a man to protect my tribe the first thing they do is
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:49.320]  train you to only care about yourself so you can be broken down and and isolated
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:53.080]  by the structure so that so that you don't have a family so that you don't
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:57.520]  have any morals you don't have any compass to stand up for so that the fake
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:02.400]  plastic corporate culture can be superimposed over what it was to be human
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:08.280]  so that we can be rendered castrated now I'm gonna go to break when I come back
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:13.080]  I'm gonna get into even bigger news but get going through your trash for no

[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:14.080]  developments is actually interviewed in Ventura's police state episode that I
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:17.680]  consulted on and also appeared in Michael German and he agrees in the piece
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:24.640]  that the threat fusion centers are the federalization spy command bases to
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:30.480]  federalize police and then to spy on the general public everyone and then
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:34.680]  basically recruit local spies and roll out against the public now why is all
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:38.940]  this just now kicking in they built the infrastructure in the name of al-qaeda it
[01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:43.400]  was never about that but for sake of argument let's say al-qaeda is real you
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:46.620]  know they're horrible and evil the point is that you go look at the
[01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:49.880]  infrastructure the training it's all about the American people so they're
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:55.640]  using the threat of al-ciyeda to take our rights now no one can debate that this

[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:19.440]  you think in Texas when I first saw the headline this morning at like 6 a.m. I
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:23.000]  thought well they must finally be admitting that tens of thousands of
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:27.600]  deaths and the kidnappings that the drug cartels are terrorist and that Texas is
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:33.360]  in trouble sure enough though it was that these groups don't believe in the
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:36.560]  Federal Reserve they don't like the government you mean the illegitimate
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:39.720]  government and here's the Sheriff's Department we have domestic terrorism
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:46.120]  right here on our doorstep no attacks no bombings nothing illegal but oh it's
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:50.120]  these sovereign citizen and some people say well I don't claim I don't need a
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:53.280]  driver's license they don't care they call that one group of terrorists you're
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:56.000]  not terrorists don't have a driver's license the illegal aliens don't have
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.760]  them you got like 20-something states saying no to the federalized ID under
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:04.320]  real IDX it's unconstitutional the Brits won't accept an ID car because they
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:10.360]  know that it's big brother you know the point is that they expand out from that
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:14.080]  to got a Ron Paul sticker love the founding fathers talk about the
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:18.320]  constitutional lot and we've got the training manuals we published them it's
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:22.440]  bizarre have cell phones wear blue jeans have camera equipment in their home
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:26.800]  don't talk a lot at work keep their desk locked it's basically everybody
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:30.400]  they're saying don't trust anybody the Walmart telescreens tattle on your
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:33.720]  neighbors why are they gearing up for this because we're going into a
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:37.520]  depression they're gonna trigger terror attacks clamp down their political
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:43.200]  opposition who understands what's happening to America so the fact that
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:46.760]  they're pre hyping all this now and all over the country not just Texas saying
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:51.160]  these patriot people are about to strike that's because the feds are telling the
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:56.560]  locals that to get them scared to run under the feds dark wings when this
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:01.800]  happens when it's the feds and their private contractors that are staging it
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:05.560]  let's go ahead and play part of this local newscast where they sit there with
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:10.720]  a straight face talking about the evil American sovereign citizens here it is
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:15.360]  the Vandera County Sheriff's Office issuing a warning to citizens about an
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:20.040]  anti-government movement known for acts of domestic terrorism followers of the
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:24.920]  sovereign citizens movement have been known to carry out violent acts including
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:28.840]  killing law enforcement officers and other public servants the Sheriff's
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:32.920]  Office tells our Tim Gerber the warning was prompted by the recent shooting death
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:39.000]  of Bear County Sheriff's Deputy Kenneth van we have domestic terrorism right at
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.600]  our doorstep Captain Charlie Hicks said while there is no evidence the death of
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:46.160]  Kenneth van has any links to the sovereign citizens it's the same type of
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.360]  crime followers are known for last May and West Memphis Arkansas a father and
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:54.560]  his teen son opened fire on two police officers with an assault rifle during a
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:58.320]  routine traffic stop the officers were killed in that shootout the father and
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:01.760]  son died in a second shootout with officers that's that's our main concern
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:06.760]  is citizens safety and police officer safety in this area Hicks says followers
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:10.000]  share the belief that the 14th Amendment tricked Americans into becoming
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.560]  citizens of the United States offering them privileges such as driver's
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:17.080]  licenses and other government benefits which act as hidden contracts through
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:20.800]  which Americans gave up their sovereignty followers are often very vocal
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:25.600]  about their beliefs they're very very serious of in their beliefs and very
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:30.800]  serious when they're when they do go to violence you know they'll kill you in
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:34.360]  the New York minute Hicks says while a training camp for similar anti-government
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:37.880]  groups was discovered in Kerr County in the past there is no evidence any
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:41.760]  members are operating in Bandera County okay citizens should still be cautious
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:46.160]  let's stop right there so so if you want the rest of the story as Paul Harvey
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:50.400]  would say what I tell you two years ago what I tell you a month ago they're
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:55.080]  gonna have to the local police and your cell phones local radio you name it the
[01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:59.640]  new alert system and they always have this planned first they train you about
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:04.080]  terror alerts nationally then they deliver them to the locals because they
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:07.920]  found that will create more fear and more chatter because folks don't believe
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:12.880]  national news people don't believe government nationally Congress is a
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:17.400]  9% approval rating so now the new terror alerts and this is admitted are
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:22.960]  delivered locally now no proof no nothing nothing going on but my gosh look
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:26.800]  out there's terrorists who are they they're the sovereign citizens then
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:32.320]  they'll have local meetings with the FBI and others at the Rotary Club at the
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:37.800]  4-H Club telling them they don't like the Federal Reserve they don't like to
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:42.880]  you in they're like well my brother does that your brother's a terrorist so see

[01:34:55.040 --> 01:35:00.160]  developments of Bilderberg 2011 parliamentarian betting it's good to
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:07.480]  have you here thank you tell us about why you're concerned about the Bilderberg
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:11.720]  group and exactly as we have the footage at night while you're there at the
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:17.680]  front gate talking to them but exactly what transpired okay first I have to
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:26.280]  apologize because I think it's very bad and second Bilderberg represent for for
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:35.120]  me the worst that could happen big number of foreign bankers foreign
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:42.120]  politicians the farmer and other people we work together without any
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:49.480]  transparency and without to be elected and they want to meet secretly in my
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:54.560]  country and some politicians of my country were also involved in that and
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:59.560]  we were very afraid that they could discuss about the future of my country
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:08.320]  about my bank my farm my neutrality my freedom of speech Switzerland is still
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:16.040]  an island of freedom in Europe and the world and this meeting represents
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:22.880]  something which is dangerous for free expression of mind and free free
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:30.280]  enterprise free democracy absolutely sir if you can a member of parliament
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:33.800]  Dominic betting just speak right into your telephone force you're a bit
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:38.720]  mobile but we are able to hear what you're saying joining us from Switzerland
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:42.600]  specifically we have gotten documents out of Bilderberg and we have sources
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:47.640]  inside Bilderberg it has been on their agenda to try to force Switzerland into
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:51.440]  the Euro but I've seen polls at Swiss info one of your big national
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:56.800]  publications that over 80% of Swiss do not want to be part of the Euro and
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:02.320]  also saw polls recently that close to 80% are very angry at Bilderberg why do
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:06.760]  you think they chose Switzerland as a place to meet because it's one of the
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:10.360]  few countries they haven't wrecked everybody else's rioting because of
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:15.960]  their banking takeovers probably yes they choose the Switzerland because
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:23.280]  Switzerland is still resistant is resistant against this new world
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:30.040]  disorder and we we are afraid what would happen with our independence with our
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:36.480]  money so two former meetings in Europe were in Greece and in Spain and you
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:41.800]  know now exactly what is happening with Greece and Spain economy they have big
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:46.960]  problems there and I'm afraid that it means this is the very meeting in my
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:53.000]  country would mean big problems for my country for my economy for my freedom
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:58.800]  for my welfare absolutely the London Guardian is reporting that the Google
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:02.480]  Boys were there looking at also trying to crack down on web freedom and we see
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:06.920]  at the very same time public meetings in the Euro talking about censoring the
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:11.360]  web and Sarkozy of France is the leader of that there's no doubt these are a
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:20.440]  group of authoritarian yes I heard about that they will try to censure
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:26.840]  the web and of course it's problem for me I'm afraid with that well this is
[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:33.320]  unprecedented sir I have never heard or seen anything like this in the 35 years
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:37.120]  that there's been coverage of Bilderberg it's obviously been around for 60 or
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:44.000]  more but this really is unprecedented what we're seeing happen right now to
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.060]  have a member of the European Union Parliament attacked and bloodied and
[01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:54.160]  that's now confirmed official government complaint and EU complaint and also have
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:58.600]  yourself and two other parliamentarians show up and deliver letters can you tell
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:02.720]  us first off what you think of the confirmed reports of the Italian
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:07.200]  European Parliament member being violently assaulted by security guards
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:10.680]  outside the site of the elitist Bilderberg conference at the Saretta
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:14.680]  Hotel in St. Mort's and the fact of the Italian government Swiss Info's
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:20.800]  reporting has lodged an official complaint yes it's a shame it's a shame
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:27.160]  that the European Parliament member could not go in this hotel at this night
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:33.720]  and I can't understand that it's a shame for my country it's a shame the
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:40.720]  freedom of speech and it means that this conference has the right of quasi-experimental
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:46.360]  reality and it's also a shame that I couldn't as Swiss politician as member
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:50.600]  of the Swiss Parliament I couldn't go in this hotel to talk with the
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:55.960]  participants I can't understand that incredible what happened when you went
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:59.240]  up to the front there's footage of it but the police made our cameras stay
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:07.440]  back 30 yards or so what was discussed when you went up a few nights ago it was
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:13.560]  a Saturday evening around midnight and talked to the security people the idea
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:18.600]  was first to have a contact with the security to ask them if everything is
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:24.920]  alright I can understand that probably this policeman didn't agree with the
[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:30.600]  fact that this conference was there but okay the chief was not there we tried to
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:36.440]  ask them to make the chief that the superintendent come to speak with us but
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:41.840]  nobody comes they said they we have to come tomorrow morning my idea was to
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:46.560]  have to discuss with them and to ask them the rights to go in the hotel and
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:51.680]  probably to have a glass in the bar and have the opportunity to talk with the
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:56.360]  participants but of course it wasn't possible and such an idea was impossible
[01:40:56.360 --> 01:41:00.880]  to realize it impossible to go in yeah answer to me without the
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:05.000]  criticism you can't go in search impossible well I'm all for free
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:08.840]  association and people being able to have private events the problem as you
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:12.080]  know sir and I've looked at the Swiss law you have the equivalent of the Logan
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:17.520]  Act we have a Logan Act we had sitting Secretary of Defense there confirmed we
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:20.480]  have other government leaders from your government meeting there it's illegal in
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:24.440]  your country it's illegal in our country and the fact is that they're in
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:29.400]  their setting policy they even had the German minister on video that we first
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:35.680]  posted it at info wars.com the dredge reports linked to it right now where the
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:38.840]  German minister and others that were caught outside and they were confronted
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:41.880]  by German speakers and they said you're in their setting agendas and he said
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:45.560]  that's right it's none of your business what agendas we're setting but we've
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:50.320]  gotten the minutes out before by our spies they are in there making deals with
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:54.840]  our elected representatives I mean this is outrageous this is not a private
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:58.400]  meeting they're setting government policy that's why you have a law against
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:02.800]  it are you going to call for criminal investigations of the Swiss members of
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:10.040]  government that were inside. Yes I agree completely with you it's a shame it's a
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:17.480]  shame but we we have we have we had the first success that it was written in the
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:22.280]  press and in the papers and for the first time probably that people could
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:27.800]  know what is happening in this country and I shall go on and to ask other
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:35.600]  questions and to inform the people about what probably happened in that
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:41.520]  conference for the Dredd Dancer all those important people from foreign
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:48.840]  governments probably talking about war in Libya probably talking about ways
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:57.640]  how to break national economy of other countries and it's not a private
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:03.280]  meeting of course it's aggressive policy against free countries in this
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:09.440]  world and I can't agree with that of course. Sir have you heard about the
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:14.280]  march because they discovered Saturday evening into Sunday morning that it was
[01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:19.440]  June 12 David Rockefeller's birthday and so literal villagers with torches
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:24.760]  saying that it's for your birthday came with a cake for Rockefeller and chanted
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:31.240]  at the gates have you seen that footage? No I don't know anything about that. Well
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:35.040]  it's quite an archetypal image and of course they didn't do anything violent
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:42.720]  and that's good but the video David Rockefeller and his birthday cake is
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:47.160]  the video up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com they normally leave
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:51.920]  Sunday evening or Monday morning a lot of them stay Jim Tucker who's covered for
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:56.040]  35 years said that they left very early and that some even left Saturday via
[01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:59.720]  helicopter and this hasn't been seen before what do you make of them high
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:08.600]  tailing and out of Switzerland? Sorry I didn't understand your question. It's
[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:14.240]  been confirmed that the Bilderberg members left earlier than they normally do
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:20.400]  do you think that they were driven out of Switzerland? Probably it was not so nice
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:27.440]  for them to to be in the spot of interest of activists and I hope that
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:32.240]  they will never come again in Switzerland. I said to them okay bye bye don't
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:39.520]  come and come back never in Switzerland. Keep out of Switzerland please. And we're
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:42.800]  showing some video right now later in the video or perhaps it's the first it
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:47.840]  shows them marching down through the night with the torches very very powerful
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:56.320]  archetypal scene like something out of the novel Frankenstein as the town's
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:01.360]  people want the monster out of their out of their town now now going back to
[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:06.480]  the day before you arrived member parliament betting from Switzerland you
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:10.000]  wrote a letter in German and we've translated it because the police were
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:15.440]  shoving people around and being very aggressive initially they they did
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:18.280]  behave themselves after you sent a letter you sent a letter to the police
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:27.160]  chief and others what did you tell them in that letter I told them that they
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:35.160]  should have to how to say that to make less less control to leave people go
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:43.480]  free in this city and the mayor of the hotel it was not possible so that police
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:50.280]  men attack or control people who were just working on the road and ask them
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:59.800]  to to have it cool and to stay stay back as much as possible and it probably was
[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:06.280]  successful well I mean you've got to be proud of Switzerland you guys marched up
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:08.920]  there and got in their face something our representatives have never done when
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:14.600]  they meet here in the US over four years the member of the EU parliament from
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:18.840]  Italy got bloodied that's now become a big diplomatic incident all over the
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:24.120]  Italian news their government is hopping mad that's going on and it's
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:31.000]  literally in hundreds of European papers dozens here so the dam has broken on the
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:39.320]  Builderburg cover-up yes what's the thing probably it was a big step in
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:46.760]  sense of progress and they will know now that it's not so good to come to to
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:50.760]  Switzerland and there are more and more people right to right and left-wing
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:58.760]  people we feel concerned about the fact that this secret discreet world
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:05.720]  government discusses without to be on the democratic control this is a big
[01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:11.480]  problem for these those people are not fully elected and they decide for our
[01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:16.360]  future without we have the right to know what is going on and it's not good that
[01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:22.000]  such meeting happen in Switzerland it's not in the free country independent
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:28.520]  and direct democratic country and it was a shame that such a meeting
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:36.200]  is current meeting could be in Switzerland well I hardly agree with you
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:41.240]  sir but again it does send a serious message to these people that decades
[01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:45.680]  ago they could hide the secret now more and more they're being exposed and they
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:49.040]  are the authors of the economic implosion happening worldwide that's on
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:53.040]  record and more and more they're being identified not there not their puppet
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:57.280]  politicians and real statesmen like yourself and Ron Paul and others I'm
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:01.840]  told folks in Switzerland a lot of them like Ron Paul
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:09.320]  sorry I didn't understand a congressman Ron Paul I'm told that folks know of
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:14.560]  Ron Paul and a lot of people in Switzerland like congressman Ron Paul I
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:20.120]  know Ron Paul I appreciate this politician do you mean you will come to
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:24.480]  Switzerland no no I mean I I just heard from my crew that was there that a lot
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:34.240]  of Swiss talked favorably about Ron Paul okay okay well in closing sir from your
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:39.600]  research what is this world government wanting to set up
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:51.240]  my first concern is the my money of Switzerland and the reserve of gold of
[01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:59.600]  Spain Switzerland could be used to to save the economy of Greece of Portugal
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:08.280]  and I'm very anxious with that the fact that there is more now in maybe I'm
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:16.880]  probably to tomorrow Syria or Iran is also a concern for me I want to be
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:24.520]  neutral in this affair and also I know that such people are discussing about
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:32.240]  all the new technologies the global technologies industrial technologies we
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:44.720]  make people be dependent from how to say that from external needs they try also
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:53.160]  to organize the campaign with food and science and the play with fear of
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:50:00.960]  catastrophe and it means that people will have no choice if they will be
[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:07.440]  waxing or not the big dance a big coordination of mass movement against
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:13.840]  freedom of everybody this is the problem yeah for those that may have
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:17.560]  missed exactly what you said but tell me I'm correct you're saying there is an
[01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:22.800]  organized psychological warfare operation using the threat of the flu wars
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:27.240]  terrorism you're saying staged to to menace us into giving up our rights is
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:34.160]  that what you just said yeah exactly I'd stay there sir one one final segment I

[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:22.560]  did a LeBron James video Drudge linked to it they got 600,000 views maybe I
[01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:26.120]  should talk about LeBron James and how it's a big distraction and his ego
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:30.080]  mania is a symptom of what's happened to this country people need to stop
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:34.440]  tattooing chosen one on their backs and start and need to start actually trying
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:38.160]  to build a better society but that is the big news in America today not the
[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:43.240]  plunging economy but that LeBron James is saying hey you know my life's better
[01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:47.600]  than your life I'm a sore loser but we won't really be talking too much about
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:51.160]  that I've got really a lot of other key news coming up the next hour and your
[01:54:51.160 --> 01:54:56.000]  phone calls will open the phones up but going back to Swiss member of Parliament
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.840]  also a psychiatrist Dominic Betting who I'm told is kind of the Ron Paul over
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:05.080]  there very popular very prominent hopefully he'll run for Prime Minister
[01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:10.320]  and get in there so he can defend his country as a statesman against these
[01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:15.000]  people but I heard in there what you were getting into about using stage crises
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:22.240]  and problem reaction events Reichstag events to take over Switzerland the same
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:26.600]  thing is being done here in America they're teaching people now that if
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:30.160]  you're against Bilderberg or the Federal Reserve you're a terrorist but then they
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:34.800]  say there's no evidence of violence from the Alex Jones Ron Paul people but
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:39.480]  we're bad and and and so that's very creepy but do they try to do that in
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:43.720]  Switzerland is any of your media demonize people sir that that are against
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:47.520]  the New World Order you know if you're not a traitor do they go after you for
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:54.360]  standing up for Switzerland yes the idea the idea is to say that people who are
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:58.840]  talking or asking questions about Bilderberg groups
[01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:03.720]  conspiracies it means that people who are crazy which think there is a big
[01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:10.640]  plot in the world that they try to discredit us like that it's the big
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:16.000]  idea where we are special people crazy people we believe in in plot
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:22.800]  theories all around the world it's very difficult to to have the courage to ask
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:27.520]  questions because also in my party many people said oh don't do that here you
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:31.640]  will be labeled as a conspiracy and that's not good for you for you with
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:38.000]  mental health or political health and this is the idea we are crazy we are
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:45.280]  people who think that the world is organized by the secret societies and
[01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:50.120]  all the time because but sir but sir isn't it the opposite I mean you're a
[01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:54.160]  psychiatrist we're the ones that aren't crazy we've Bilderberg members have
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:58.320]  written books bragging about global government the Financial Times has written
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:02.200]  admitting it's authoritarian but for own good they admit they quote want green
[01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:08.920]  green fascism they they openly are are pushing you know unelected bureaucracies
[01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:14.160]  controlling nations and just five years ago they said it didn't exist and we
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:19.320]  were insane now it exists but we're insane for not liking it I mean this is
[01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:30.040]  incredible exactly yes yes but we could do this time with other people we could
[01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:36.160]  do the fact to ask questions to the government and the press was obliged to
[01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:42.600]  to talk about that I mean it's a big success because all see our questions
[01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:47.120]  with the fact that first among these democracy direct democracy it's very
[01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:52.760]  important it's a cultural policy in my country people after the last word in
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:59.280]  in the group government each people has their last world and the fact that big
[01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:04.880]  rich foreign people can meet and without people have the right to know what is
[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:09.400]  happening not good enough tradition well that's why you're so wealthy and so
[01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:14.040]  free because you are of whippersnappers when it comes to freedom and and you're
[01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:17.800]  in there in their face and you dominated media coverage your points got out
[01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:22.240]  mainstream media they're starting to say yeah Bilderberg is sinister the
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:26.000]  Bilderberg guys got caught out and surrounded and said yeah we do have an
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:29.520]  agenda none of your business so we showed their arrogance I'll say by theater
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:33.560]  in the break but we'll let you go member of parliament in Switzerland
[01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:37.520]  Dominique Betting we really appreciate you joining us third hour straight ahead

[02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:19.920]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:30.840]  Alex Jones okay I do want to sometimes when you're too close to something it's
[02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:35.200]  hard to afterwards to really go over the aftermath of it and then probably put
[02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:38.960]  it in context but I do want to run through some of the big Bilderberg news
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:45.120]  coming up later in the hour but we need to continue the discussion of the new
[02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:48.800]  FBI manual and it says we'll go through your trash we'll tap you without
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:54.200]  warrants we'll spy on you we'll break in your house without warrants and yeah it
[02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:57.520]  has nothing to do with Al Qaeda if you don't like the Federal Reserve gang rape
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:02.120]  and you were coming well they can't get everybody they can't stop everybody from
[02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:07.920]  speaking out and saying no and we're at a big crossroads here right now we're at
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:17.760]  a we're at a huge huge crossroads right now where the system knows that we're
[02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:21.720]  waking up they know that we're identifying their criminal activities
[02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:29.480]  they know that the awakening is exponential and so undoubtedly I believe
[02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:35.840]  the system is going to stage terror attacks in America and the next wave
[02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:41.320]  will be a mixture of foreign attacks and domestic it'll all really be globalist
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:46.320]  launched and so after I take some calls I'm gonna go back over that but you need
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:50.400]  to understand if you tuned in last hour and you heard me talk about this for
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:55.120]  about 10 minutes and I said here's the rest of the story please understand
[02:01:55.120 --> 02:02:00.240]  that none of that was my opinion it's a hundred percent a rollout an
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:04.680]  incremental takeover of society it's always more more more more more and
[02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:10.120]  everything they always add on every month every year to the secret police
[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:16.040]  network was announced before 9-11 by the Rand Corporation and others of what
[02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:20.040]  they were going to build so it's the fact that it's all an architecture designed
[02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:24.240]  I've got the blueprints I'm telling you what's coming next I always know it's
[02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:30.080]  gonna come next because I'm watching them okay I have their blueprint so it's
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:33.160]  like if I had the blueprints and I was watching a house being built down the
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:37.880]  street from my home and I could sit there in my front window you know eating
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:43.560]  biscuits and mustard like sling blade and I'm I'm watching them and I go well
[02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:48.280]  the plans say they're gonna lay the foundation now the plans say that North
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:52.080]  Wall is gonna go up next and then they're gonna put in the second floor
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:55.640]  and they're gonna put in the plumbing they're gonna put in the electrical I'm
[02:02:55.640 --> 02:03:01.880]  sitting here watching it being built and to newbies who don't study geopolitical
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:07.480]  systems who don't study the current military industrial complex ruling
[02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:11.240]  class you know they hear somebody saying yeah you know the government's plans
[02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:14.720]  you know what they're rolling out you know what they're gonna do next they
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:18.280]  just can't even believe it a because they weren't listening years ago and I
[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:23.360]  let it all out b because they can't imagine someone knows all about this
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:30.800]  listen I'll be honest I watch people that are basketball fans or golf fans or
[02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:39.360]  you know fans of complex card games like bridge or something and it's like man
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:43.040]  they really know all the subtle nuances and all the rules of this this looks
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:46.720]  really complex but then once you actually try to play the game and start
[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:49.680]  watching and start studying it then you think well why didn't I know that all
[02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:56.840]  along if we can have a mass understanding of what's going on a a mass
[02:03:56.840 --> 02:04:01.040]  awakening we're really going to be able to turn the corner against tyranny
[02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:04.560]  worldwide now I want to open the phones up but I want to open them up for
[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:10.320]  specific people and then tomorrow we'll have wide-open phones for everybody who
[02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:14.920]  were in Switzerland or were Americans or Brits or others who went to the
[02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:19.440]  Bilderberg conference I want to hear from you about what you saw on the ground
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:23.560]  what you thought do you think this is historical when we come back from break
[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:26.120]  I'll probably take four or five of those and then towards the end of the hour if
[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:36.440]  we have time I'll open up for general calls 1-800-259-9231-8259-9231 and I
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:40.560]  forget the toll number for folks that can't call 1-800 out of Europe I forget
[02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:43.600]  that I'll look it up during the break and give it out on the other side but
[02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:50.640]  800-259-9231 I just want to say great job to the 300 400 or so the news
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:54.200]  reported that ended up showing up the demonstration that's a lot to go to the
[02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:58.040]  middle of nowhere on short notice so great job we'll be back with more news
[02:04:58.040 --> 02:05:03.440]  stay with us this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:07.680]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:11.880]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[02:05:11.880 --> 02:05:15.800]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[02:05:15.800 --> 02:05:19.440]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:24.000]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:28.640]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:32.400]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:35.880]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:39.800]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:28.480]  for a couple segments to give us your take on the criminal global elite many
[02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:31.520]  of which have written books individually admitting they want to set up a
[02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:35.600]  tyrannical world government a global carbon tax the end of national sovereignty
[02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:40.960]  the end of individual private property the end of internet freedom this is
[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:44.520]  their policy this is what they want this is what they admit they want to do and
[02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:49.760]  and their over-driving policy is world population reduction founded by the
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:53.000]  Nazi Prince Bernhardt of the Netherlands whose wife was the Queen of the
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:56.520]  Netherlands his daughter is the head of Bilderberg today along with Etienne
[02:08:56.520 --> 02:09:02.480]  Davin on the Viscount now here's the toll number it's not toll free because
[02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:09.040]  folks overseas unless they're calling on Skype can't call toll free one six five
[02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:14.880]  one six nine five seven seven seven seven one six five one six nine five seven
[02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:19.720]  seven seven seven or if you're in Europe and want to comment about the austerity
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:23.840]  the Bilderberg group is bringing in raising your taxes cutting your benefits
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:29.840]  to pay them money on debts they created six five one six nine five seven seven
[02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:34.760]  seven seven your country code into the US our country code than six five one six
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:39.480]  nine five seven seven seven but I want to play the audio in the video of the
[02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:45.000]  exclusive footage that great activist there handed off to Aaron and Aaron
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:48.840]  Dykes who did just a fabulous job there also the crew here at home couldn't do it
[02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:53.480]  without them working as a team I got this video has been up on Drudge now
[02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:57.880]  through the one in Guardian for two days hundreds of thousands of views RT has
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:10:01.600]  now gotten a hold of some footage from Luke Radowski who was also there and
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:05.040]  it's even a little bit clearer than our footage I got a lot of emails and saw a
[02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:09.120]  lot of comments saying why is some of your footage not zooming in and out why
[02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:14.560]  is your footage a little bit blurry well because we were shooting it on Apple
[02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:22.640]  iPhones live and transmitting it up to Justin TV and people complain about ads
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:26.520]  on Justin TV we don't get any of that we ought to sign up and find out if we
[02:10:26.520 --> 02:10:32.280]  should three million five hundred thousand views on Justin TV it was a test
[02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:36.360]  account we had we never really used and it's gotten over three hundred three
[02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:40.040]  million five hundred thousand views in the last four or five days so just an
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:46.200]  example the power of info wars calm and prison planet calm but it's blurred
[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:51.480]  because it's not high res it's low res video that was pumped out over the
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:55.200]  cell phone networks and we bought a phone that would work in Switzerland and
[02:10:55.200 --> 02:11:00.360]  then the guys called me and said well the data package ran out and now it's
[02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:04.880]  basically five hundred dollars per two minute video and I said keep going well
[02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:08.440]  the guys did keep going and it looks like the bills gonna be upwards of ten
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:13.880]  thousand dollars so that's ten thousand dollars of money we blew to bring you the
[02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:18.720]  footage to have it first because sure we could shoot video go cut it out encode it
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:22.720]  load it try to get it over the hotel slow internet not get it out no we were
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:26.800]  shooting live on the ground so yes that's why it's a little bit blurry but
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:30.760]  it's still quite clear and it looks like the internet video did look six seven
[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:35.560]  years ago yeah we're so used to really high res on the web now but that is a
[02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:40.960]  point I need to call AT&T and try to get the bigger data package now maybe
[02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:46.560]  retroactively I forgot to tell the IT folks that here I am engaged in behind
[02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:50.400]  the scene stuff on air just because I have absolutely no time and I'm and I'm
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:54.520]  you had to make the decision to spend all that money just to give you the live
[02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:58.840]  instant reports for folks that were watching but for folks that weren't
[02:11:58.840 --> 02:12:02.840]  watching it live here is that audio and video and I'll be talking over some of
[02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:07.920]  the points where you just hear the crowd screaming at Bilderberg group members
[02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:14.680]  who had basically snuck out and taken the the ski lifts up the top of the
[02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:19.280]  mountain to a resort up there the police would not let our guys even get up
[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:22.960]  there when they were there via the road whatever was going on up there was so
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:26.920]  special and here comes the head of Google and others and then you know
[02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:31.880]  British foreign ministers and German ministers and German Chinese ministers
[02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:38.720]  down the hill led by some woman in a Princess Leia outfit literally it was
[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:44.040]  very bizarre and then then they tried to basically duck under the police line to
[02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:48.360]  get away from the crowds so this is historical on so many fronts here's
[02:12:48.360 --> 02:13:08.600]  that footage
[02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:37.720]  says this is horrible when the crowd gets up there
[02:13:37.720 --> 02:13:42.200]  they're talking to the German minister they say we don't like your secret
[02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:46.960]  agenda tells what you're doing he goes our agenda the guardians translated it
[02:13:46.960 --> 02:14:01.720]  we're discussing our agenda it's none of your business there's Lord Mandelson
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:17.480]  heavily hated in England and that's where he talks about it's our agenda and
[02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:21.560]  it's none of your business you've got government leaders of Germany England
[02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:25.520]  and others in the US Robert Gates violated the Logan Act the Defense
[02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:29.680]  Secretary to meet at that Hillary was fined over $300,000 for it in the
[02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:40.360]  mid-90s a crank this up from Germany and life reporting from St. Moritz and yes
[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:47.600]  the Bilderberger did it they dared it and they tried to show their face they
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:56.760]  showed their face and went really round about one half kilometer from up the
[02:14:56.760 --> 02:15:06.240]  hill down to the main resort and I recognized even mr. Steinbrück who
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:15.040]  was the former financial minister of Germany and also of course the others
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:19.520]  recognized him and here again somebody came
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:36.840]  all right and there's a lot more of it Aaron will be back soon but I got to
[02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:40.760]  give him a few days off I know Aaron he won't want to be off but to like boil
[02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:44.040]  down all this amazing footage we've got and pump it out to everybody at
[02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:50.160]  prisonplanet.tv again we loaded the phone lines up from Europe last Friday
[02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:55.800]  when I did this and I do see some calls now coming in but we're just taking
[02:15:55.800 --> 02:15:59.960]  calls from people that were there or we can widen it to people in Europe to get
[02:15:59.960 --> 02:16:03.800]  your take on what's happened the toll-free number to join us dial the
[02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:12.360]  US country code and then 651-695-7777 and we'll get you up and on the air but
[02:16:12.360 --> 02:16:17.200]  big coverage the London Guardian is the biggest paper not just in England but in
[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:21.320]  Europe because English is the language that's how the Europeans all communicate
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:25.840]  with each other is with English so most Europeans are bilingual and so that the
[02:16:25.840 --> 02:16:32.280]  Guardian is is conservatively the biggest paper in England and probably in
[02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:38.880]  Europe as well. Bilderberg 2011 Lord Mandelson's nature walk Charlie
[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:44.760]  Skelton looks on as Peter Mandelson and some billionaire buddies take the air at
[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:48.560]  Bilderberg and he breaks it down and then links to our footage of that we
[02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:53.640]  appreciate the great reportage of Charlie Skelton there at Bilderberg 2011
[02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:58.600]  we're probably gonna be getting him on the show to pop in tomorrow we also have
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:02.800]  AP with the headline they reported on they waited till Bilderberg had closed
[02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:07.280]  Sunday and they had all basically fled early to run the headline VIP's
[02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:12.440]  conspiracy theorist descend on Swiss resort yeah you got members of
[02:17:12.440 --> 02:17:18.720]  Parliament European Union Parliament psychiatrists doctors media they're
[02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:22.400]  wanting to know what's going on and you're a conspiracy theorist you see
[02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:26.320]  these are the same conspiracy theorists that knew this existed back when the AP
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:32.440]  made jokes about it a decade ago not existing but still because they will be
[02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:38.640]  basically work for these people they say oh VIP's they're very important persons
[02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:44.600]  but you are a conspiracy theorist so translated wonderful powerful important
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:51.520]  humans and subhumans descend on Swiss resort and you heard the doctor earlier
[02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:57.440]  when we had the member of the Swiss Parliament Dr. Dominic Betting on you
[02:17:57.440 --> 02:18:00.440]  heard him breaking down the fact that that's what they say that if you ask
[02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:04.760]  questions you're a conspiracy theorist that's what a conspiracy theorist is oh
[02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:11.000]  sure there are people who do theorize who ask questions about maybe the son is a
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:18.040]  isn't is a fried egg but they have no proof we say politicians constantly lie
[02:18:18.040 --> 02:18:21.920]  power crops absolute power crops absolutely powerful people get together
[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:25.920]  and want more power here's all our evidence of Bilderberg here's our moles
[02:18:25.920 --> 02:18:29.920]  inside Bilderberg here's what their agenda is we've been proven accurate
[02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:34.560]  year after year after year after year and their intellectual answer to that is
[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:43.200]  you are a conspiracy theorist and you know I kind of like this experience this
[02:18:43.200 --> 02:18:49.960]  I've never in 16 years of being on radio not had callers even I'm not gonna call
[02:18:49.960 --> 02:18:55.040]  from callers from Japan and they call in I can call from callers from Mexico they
[02:18:55.040 --> 02:18:59.840]  call in load the lines I guess because I'm going up for such a small group 300
[02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:04.280]  400 people that actually went that they're either at work or haven't gotten
[02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:08.120]  home yet so they're not calling in I guess that is a small small window of
[02:19:08.120 --> 02:19:11.600]  people to be able to call into the show it is a elite minority of great folks
[02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:16.120]  that went more part of history really breaking the dam of the Bilderberg group
[02:19:16.120 --> 02:19:20.080]  cover-up this is the beginning of the fall of Bilderberg and so I'll just open

[02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:25.480]  it's so important and I'm gonna cover that more tomorrow but this is the new
[02:24:25.480 --> 02:24:30.760]  terror threat alert system not my opinion remember I told you it was gonna
[02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:34.880]  be individual alerts to towns and cities that would then be fear-mongered as if
[02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:39.480]  they were real and it's now admitted Homeland Security tells thousands of
[02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:42.600]  counties all over the country and now hundreds the Bandera one got picked up
[02:24:42.600 --> 02:24:47.380]  by drugs so folks know about that in Texas but this is all over the news the
[02:24:47.380 --> 02:24:51.880]  police chiefs are coming out the sheriffs are coming out saying terrorists
[02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:55.000]  that don't like the Federal Reserve in the New World Order about to hit they
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:58.600]  want to kill cops by the way there's no evidence they're in the area or that
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:03.040]  they are gonna kill cops just if they talk about freedom and the New World
[02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:08.440]  Order they're evil they want to kill you citizens please tattle on them and it's
[02:25:08.440 --> 02:25:13.680]  created chilling effect it's branding real Americans is bad this is how bad
[02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:18.120]  guys take over they don't go we're bad guys the feds go and tell local cops
[02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:21.960]  this and well-meaning cops then who don't understand what's happening come out
[02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:26.680]  and then tell everybody this the feds couldn't get any credibility the last
[02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:32.600]  nine years with their stupid you know color-coded thing so they've shifted to
[02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:38.160]  this local threat system put out by the feds and it's nothing but fear mongering
[02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:43.960]  it's a political desperation tool and they're kicking it into gear right now
[02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:48.160]  because Obama isn't so much trouble and then Robert Shapiro and all these other
[02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:54.880]  Obama advisors put out reports saying we need another Oklahoma City to save
[02:25:54.880 --> 02:26:04.400]  Obama I mean it is only one millimeter of it being veiled because they think
[02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:10.000]  you're so stupid now the globalists are gonna have a problem the minute the feds
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:14.000]  blow up a new federal building the minute you hear that they've blown up a
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:18.560]  chemical plant or blown up a building and they'll be saying it's patriots that
[02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:22.480]  people that like Ron Paul did it or Alex Jones listeners you've got to get
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:27.120]  there with cameras because with the Oklahoma City the local news was like
[02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:31.080]  there they are removing the other bombs yes the ATF was going to work that day
[02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:33.840]  because and then you know they had to kill some of the witnesses and stuff
[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:37.600]  later and but because of that it really caught them with their pants down this
[02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:41.400]  time we're gonna really catch him it's like Kurt Haskell with the underwear
[02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:45.520]  bomber saw the US government get him on the plane for a month and a half the
[02:26:45.520 --> 02:26:49.320]  media said your conspiracy theorist then the pressure got to him the under
[02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:54.040]  secretary of state said I was ordered by an unnamed US intelligence agency to
[02:26:54.040 --> 02:27:01.400]  get him on the plane without a passport now we're gonna catch you you better be
[02:27:01.400 --> 02:27:05.040]  aware of that you can call us terrorist all day we know you're the murdering
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:09.840]  stinking filth government you're not our government your crooks posing as our
[02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:13.640]  government and we're aware of you and the jigs up let's go to phone calls I
[02:27:13.640 --> 02:27:17.640]  got a bunch of other news here it's just I kind of got exhausted in New York I
[02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:21.200]  think I'm doing a good radio show today it's just that I I am a little a little
[02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:27.880]  bit a little bit frazzled I'll put it to you that way and the excitement of last
[02:27:27.880 --> 02:27:32.120]  week with Bilderberg I barely slept Thursday and for no no Wednesday and
[02:27:32.120 --> 02:27:35.680]  Thursday I barely slept I went to bed like two in the morning got up at about
[02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:41.440]  five and then I barely slept in New York so I don't know why I'm saying that on
[02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:44.440]  air it's just I always say what I'm thinking that's why I'm thinking man I
[02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:48.120]  feel like I got run over by freight train Richard in Indiana you're on the
[02:27:48.120 --> 02:27:52.440]  air go ahead hi Alex thank you for the great Bilderberg coverage and your team
[02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:56.240]  what a great job but on a different subject I've been following crude oil
[02:27:56.240 --> 02:28:00.280]  prices lately and wondered if you've heard from Lindsay Williams why the
[02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:03.840]  retreat over the last three weeks and it's kind of held gone up a little down
[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:09.080]  a little anything new about what Lindsay might say from the insiders well
[02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:13.760]  when you get Lindsay back on I mean I've done for years that it was Ken from
[02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:17.000]  former head of Atlantic Ridgefield was one of them I know who the other source
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:21.440]  is I can't give that out and I've always said you know those sources that's what
[02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:24.880]  they believe is gonna go on and they are high-level people but it doesn't mean
[02:28:24.880 --> 02:28:28.080]  they're always a hundred percent right they don't run everything you know
[02:28:28.080 --> 02:28:31.360]  Obama's gonna get his health care repealed do you think they want that to
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:34.960]  happen no but we're gonna repeal it you know they're not all powerful but
[02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:41.000]  Lindsay you know did say when oil was 60 something dollars a barrel he did say
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:45.960]  that it would go up to 150 or 200 in the next six months to a year he said that
[02:28:45.960 --> 02:28:50.560]  in October so we're now eight nine months into this and it did go up on 40
[02:28:50.560 --> 02:28:56.080]  something dollars so he's partially right but his elite friends won't be
[02:28:56.080 --> 02:29:02.320]  right if within about three months it hasn't gone to 150 or more but but I
[02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:05.680]  know who the sources are I know they're telling him this I've always said though
[02:29:05.680 --> 02:29:09.640]  that occasionally they could throw in a lie to Lindsay you know so this is not
[02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:15.320]  100% I mean Lindsay's a truthful guy he has real sources he's he's credible it's
[02:29:15.320 --> 02:29:18.520]  not that Lindsay's being deceptive I don't trust these people completely I
[02:29:18.520 --> 02:29:22.920]  don't even a hundred percent trust Tucker's sources because someday they
[02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:28.240]  could give him disinfo even though Jim Tucker sources have been proven 100
[02:29:28.240 --> 02:29:33.320]  percent accurate which then proves that Bilderberg is to a great extent calling
[02:29:33.320 --> 02:29:37.680]  the shots because Tucker said some stuff sounded crazy over the years and it
[02:29:37.680 --> 02:29:43.200]  happens right on time in fact Tucker it was reading back over the news it turns
[02:29:43.200 --> 02:29:49.440]  out he talked about it going from 16 to 150 back in 2008 and it did with people
[02:29:49.440 --> 02:29:56.160]  thought was crazy we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[02:29:56.160 --> 02:29:59.640]  GCN radio network
[02:30:01.480 --> 02:30:06.320]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[02:30:06.320 --> 02:30:10.880]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[02:30:10.880 --> 02:30:14.840]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[02:30:14.840 --> 02:30:19.520]  termed in this influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[02:30:19.520 --> 02:30:24.120]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:28.480]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[02:30:28.480 --> 02:30:33.760]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on

[02:30:38.080 --> 02:30:41.560]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[02:30:41.560 --> 02:30:46.800]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we

[02:33:34.200 --> 02:33:39.400]  Goodyear blimp plunges of the ground in flames over Germany I mean it's just
[02:33:39.400 --> 02:33:44.800]  wild what a crazy world we live it looks like the Hindenburg but I guess they

[02:33:51.760 --> 02:33:57.880]  valiant pilot getting them out of there and then burning up himself what a hero

[02:34:12.040 --> 02:34:17.760]  talk to Mabel in Virginia thanks for holding her on the air hello hi yeah
[02:34:17.760 --> 02:34:23.040]  I'm first-time caller and I've been supporting you for a couple years now
[02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:31.200]  65 years old and what I see a lot of problem is with the mainstream media is
[02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:37.080]  why a lot of people don't want to listen and think I'm a conspiracy theorist is
[02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:42.320]  I feel like there's a problem with the mainstream media they don't pick up
[02:34:42.320 --> 02:34:46.520]  anything about the Bilderbergs or anything like that although I did see Ron
[02:34:46.520 --> 02:34:53.440]  Paul twice on CNN and I don't believe them anymore and I just wonder what you
[02:34:53.440 --> 02:34:58.040]  thought about what you could do about the mainstream media well here's what's
[02:34:58.040 --> 02:35:04.120]  happening and and and and that's a great question Mabel it's good to hear from
[02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:09.080]  you I appreciate the call that's what my speech was about at talkers to the big
[02:35:09.080 --> 02:35:14.120]  radio execs and hosting people in New York was they wanted to know why I was
[02:35:14.120 --> 02:35:20.680]  so successful but they wanted to some of them about a magic widget I had or some
[02:35:20.680 --> 02:35:24.840]  technical thing I had that made us so successful and I got up there and I said
[02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:28.760]  listen I'm not even the best talker in the world a lot of you are a lot more
[02:35:28.760 --> 02:35:32.560]  well-spoken than I am you have bigger vocabularies you're just as smart or
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:37.120]  smarter I said I've been successful because I have passion and I've been
[02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:42.720]  proven accurate and people trust me and we've also had to innovate to get our
[02:35:42.720 --> 02:35:46.760]  message out so we've tried everything and so we've had a lot of success in
[02:35:46.760 --> 02:35:52.640]  different venues because we've tried everything I mean I tried Justin TV three
[02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:57.400]  years ago at the DNC and you know we got a few hundred thousand views but the
[02:35:57.400 --> 02:36:02.320]  technology was so cruddy that I dropped it we tried it again this week got over
[02:36:02.320 --> 02:36:08.480]  three million views and we're looking at some other platforms as well as we could
[02:36:08.480 --> 02:36:12.040]  stream live free video to people when we're on the ground I mean that really
[02:36:12.040 --> 02:36:15.640]  is the future of reporting all citizen journalists well we'll be able to use
[02:36:15.640 --> 02:36:20.920]  this and on top of all of our other tens of millions of listeners and viewers I
[02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:26.760]  mean three million plus three and a half million and growing I checked it last
[02:36:26.760 --> 02:36:30.320]  night it was three and a half million I don't know what it is now just on the
[02:36:30.320 --> 02:36:35.360]  Justin TV channel my guys with cell phones in Switzerland shooting little
[02:36:35.360 --> 02:36:41.960]  two-minute videos and three million people watched it I mean Glenn Beck at his
[02:36:41.960 --> 02:36:46.920]  height had three million viewers a night people kill for three million viewers
[02:36:46.920 --> 02:36:54.320]  people people go to any length for that and here we are on every media format
[02:36:54.320 --> 02:37:02.160]  growing now the system to answer your question ma'am see see here's why I
[02:37:02.160 --> 02:37:05.840]  can't be simple everything is really complex the world is complex and we've
[02:37:05.840 --> 02:37:10.280]  gotten in these bad positions and media dominant corporate media is not so
[02:37:10.280 --> 02:37:15.080]  dominant these days is able to lie to you because most of their own operatives
[02:37:15.080 --> 02:37:19.040]  are just dumbed down as well and just repeating what corporations and
[02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:23.480]  government press releases tell them out of pure laziness they don't have a
[02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:28.160]  passion for the news they don't have passion for analysis they're not
[02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:33.800]  obsessed with it and so most media that's you know quote establishment is
[02:37:33.800 --> 02:37:40.000]  not even so much lying to you purposefully they don't know which end is
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:46.400]  up now what's happening is cable networks plunging broadcast TV
[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:52.440]  disintegrating newspapers decimated I mean you know the drill none of this is
[02:37:52.440 --> 02:37:58.520]  a secret alternative media we have Saturn rockets tied to our backs I mean
[02:37:58.520 --> 02:38:05.000]  we are blasting through the stratosphere people in fact we've even done a
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:10.480]  test I've done videos in my new fancy studio people don't even like it as
[02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:22.560]  much folks just automatically do not like anything that's slick now they just
[02:38:22.560 --> 02:38:31.360]  out of hand do not like the mainstream media and again we need to stop using
[02:38:31.360 --> 02:38:37.560]  that term mainstream media because more and more it is not the mainstream it is
[02:38:37.560 --> 02:38:44.480]  the propaganda media it is the establishment press release repeater
[02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:53.640]  network now it's no secret that they're falling apart but what have I told you
[02:38:53.640 --> 02:38:58.960]  from for more than 10 years since 2000 for 11 years what have I told you each
[02:38:58.960 --> 02:39:03.080]  and every week on the week how many hundreds of articles have I written and
[02:39:03.080 --> 02:39:07.080]  Aaron Dykes and Paul Watson and Steve Watson are doubly Paul's been with us
[02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:11.720]  almost 10 years now it'll be 10 10 years next month how many hundreds of
[02:39:11.720 --> 02:39:15.680]  articles have we written saying here's how they're going to kill the internet
[02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:20.080]  here's exactly how they're going to do it here's how they're gonna phase out the
[02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:26.120]  internet you knew and put you on to an internet that is not free and we explain
[02:39:26.120 --> 02:39:31.560]  the taxes the regulations the tracking the internet IDs the new private
[02:39:31.560 --> 02:39:36.720]  network internets the cloud systems the internet to network where oh yeah you
[02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:40.440]  can still be on the old internet that the Pentagon is going to cyber attack and
[02:39:40.440 --> 02:39:44.040]  basically shut down but if you want to be on our new internet you're going to be
[02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:47.680]  tracked you're going to be traced you're going to be taxed and you're we're
[02:39:47.680 --> 02:39:55.120]  going to decide via terms of service what you can and can't say and so I
[02:39:55.120 --> 02:40:01.480]  told you a decade ago they didn't call it cloud computing then internet to put
[02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:06.960]  out public minutes of their meetings in Tokyo and Austin Texas and Chicago one
[02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:15.320]  one meeting a year fortune 500 top universities and government and they
[02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:18.560]  get at the meetings they stand up there and they tell you exactly how they're
[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:23.400]  going to kill the web and it's it's complex it's a lot of different things
[02:40:23.400 --> 02:40:26.640]  like Lego pieces you see them all over the table you're like how does that kill
[02:40:26.640 --> 02:40:32.400]  the internet internet IDs internet taxes to platforms cloud computing you
[02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:37.960]  notice Microsoft Apple and Google have all announced in the last month the
[02:40:37.960 --> 02:40:41.280]  cloud computing and you're like well that's great I don't have to have a big
[02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:47.280]  device on me uh-huh yes everything's a double-edged sword technology is neutral
[02:40:47.280 --> 02:40:54.480]  generally but you're going to now have your information on their system and
[02:40:54.480 --> 02:41:00.720]  soon the devices are not going to be able to store your data on them the
[02:41:00.720 --> 02:41:06.160]  software is not going to interface with the cloud systems and they described it
[02:41:06.160 --> 02:41:11.560]  back in 2000 2001 as everything will be on private networks private servers the
[02:41:11.560 --> 02:41:15.600]  devices you have a lonely interface and then you'll be under their rules and
[02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:19.800]  their control and you're like well I just won't go on their websites they have
[02:41:19.800 --> 02:41:24.640]  set up with government and corporate money the new internet the new servers
[02:41:24.640 --> 02:41:30.240]  the new systems where that is the internet and they're shunting off the
[02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:35.400]  majority of the regular real organic internet more and more into their
[02:41:35.400 --> 02:41:40.640]  systems and the big technology companies the technologists are getting
[02:41:40.640 --> 02:41:45.640]  together and openly charting and bragging about this system and how it's a
[02:41:45.640 --> 02:41:51.080]  monopoly for them it's very simple it's kind of like foreign companies coming
[02:41:51.080 --> 02:41:55.920]  into the u.s. financing your state legislature and a year later they sign
[02:41:55.920 --> 02:41:59.920]  over half the highways in your state to the foreign company to put tolls on
[02:41:59.920 --> 02:42:05.560]  existing roads and you say it's illegal to put tolls on existing roads well
[02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:09.840]  Bush signed a waiver an executive order saying it was okay well that itself is
[02:42:09.840 --> 02:42:13.200]  unconstitutional well we've got to enforce the Constitution it's there to
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:18.840]  protect us people say well the Constitution failed but he's something
[02:42:18.840 --> 02:42:23.520]  new no we failed it and it's the same thing with this internet too so that's
[02:42:23.520 --> 02:42:27.440]  why the head of Microsoft was there that's why the head of Google was at
[02:42:27.440 --> 02:42:31.040]  Bilderberg that's why they're meeting with Mandelson who's openly called for
[02:42:31.040 --> 02:42:36.840]  internet censorship there's a headline from ZD net dragons in the cloud
[02:42:36.840 --> 02:42:43.360]  Apple Google Amazon and Microsoft and what did Google and Microsoft and others
[02:42:43.360 --> 02:42:47.960]  help the Chinese government the last decade you know Google and Microsoft and
[02:42:47.960 --> 02:42:53.760]  others helped set up the protocols for tracking for blacklist for internet
[02:42:53.760 --> 02:42:59.560]  IDs for firewalls against alternative media in China they know how to do it
[02:42:59.560 --> 02:43:04.400]  you know when I hear these idiotic statements of well you you know they
[02:43:04.400 --> 02:43:09.400]  won't be able to censor the internet I haven't even gotten into one-tenth of it
[02:43:09.400 --> 02:43:12.960]  that's the problem I said I'd go to your calls but the lady raises an important
[02:43:12.960 --> 02:43:17.280]  point their old media is dying they're desperate they're a bunch of crooks who
[02:43:17.280 --> 02:43:20.240]  know they've been caught are they gonna let the internet continue to operate as
[02:43:20.240 --> 02:43:24.840]  it was no they're not gonna stop with clouds and new devices they only work
[02:43:24.840 --> 02:43:28.880]  on clouds they're not gonna stop with internet IDs and internet taxes you see
[02:43:28.880 --> 02:43:32.800]  all those things getting passed the cyber security act openly says under
[02:43:32.800 --> 02:43:38.360]  federal law all IT professionals will have to get a federal certification all
[02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:44.200]  IT that serves a hundred or more customers that means readers even will
[02:43:44.200 --> 02:43:49.960]  have to have federally approved devices in their internal network to protect you
[02:43:49.960 --> 02:43:56.800]  from hacking in quotes and alert government to the hacking now you
[02:43:56.800 --> 02:43:59.720]  notice they're trying to pass cyber security again they've already put this
[02:43:59.720 --> 02:44:02.720]  in place they just want to make it the law now so they can come out in the open
[02:44:02.720 --> 02:44:07.600]  with it and what are they saying oh my gosh we're being hacked oh the IMF
[02:44:07.600 --> 02:44:12.880]  World Bank's being hacked oh we've got to pass the cyber security and this is not
[02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:17.320]  my opinion this is what they always said they would do so they build the web
[02:44:17.320 --> 02:44:21.400]  your your tax money going into government systems but predominantly your
[02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:25.520]  purchase of bandwidth computers telecommunication services it's the
[02:44:25.520 --> 02:44:30.120]  only growth area in our economy in the last decade or so the only thing keeping
[02:44:30.120 --> 02:44:34.480]  America afloat is technology and integration of these systems and the
[02:44:34.480 --> 02:44:38.600]  development and now they're just gobbling it up as monopoly men in the
[02:44:38.600 --> 02:44:44.480]  name of security it's the same on every front the threat of cyber terror the
[02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:49.000]  threat of physical terror it's the skeleton key that opens every door for
[02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:54.120]  these people and so the fight is on will people organize against it will folks
[02:44:54.120 --> 02:45:00.280]  recognize what it is I don't know but we're already blocked on Google news we
[02:45:00.280 --> 02:45:05.080]  weren't a year ago they already are trying to block our Google bombs
[02:45:05.080 --> 02:45:09.120]  undoubtedly with a key index of keywords that have been blocked if I give some
[02:45:09.120 --> 02:45:13.640]  obscure word it becomes number one I can't give big terms like Bilderberg
[02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:16.640]  now and have it be number one they blocked it there's no doubt we went to
[02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:21.240]  number one they blocked it it wasn't even in the top hundred last week they
[02:45:21.240 --> 02:45:27.280]  blocked it so they know what they're doing and already they admittedly had
[02:45:27.280 --> 02:45:31.440]  changed their algorithm three times this year so far and Google openly said it's
[02:45:31.440 --> 02:45:38.280]  to block alternative media websites like info wars calm and drudge report we're
[02:45:38.280 --> 02:45:42.640]  not alternative media we are the media I mean I could have 10 billion listeners
[02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:46.760]  and others not 10 billion people it's hypothetical I could have 7 billion
[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:50.680]  listeners every person on earth and Google would say I was alternative media
[02:45:50.680 --> 02:45:55.120]  and block me what they mean is they don't want you having the choice they
[02:45:55.120 --> 02:46:00.160]  don't want my ideas on the intellectual store shelf they don't want you
[02:46:00.160 --> 02:46:04.440]  having access to it they're already testing censorship models they're
[02:46:04.440 --> 02:46:10.240]  already trying to block us they're already trying to squeeze us the feds
[02:46:10.240 --> 02:46:13.400]  are announcing in the kill switch I told you wouldn't just be a kill switch
[02:46:13.400 --> 02:46:18.440]  government messages of a radio TV your cell phone it got announced last month
[02:46:18.440 --> 02:46:22.440]  I told you they'd have telescreens in public places it got announced four
[02:46:22.440 --> 02:46:27.120]  months ago folks this is happening I told you the FBI was gonna start breaking
[02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:30.920]  in your house without warrants and going through your trash it's been announced
[02:46:30.920 --> 02:46:35.360]  Associated Press New York Times no warrants going through your garbage
[02:46:35.360 --> 02:46:40.960]  breaking into your house they're doing it okay they tell us what they're gonna
[02:46:40.960 --> 02:46:46.280]  do years before in their internal memorandums and reports oh heaven help
[02:46:46.280 --> 02:46:53.080]  us they're not adding all this because the terror threat is increasing they're
[02:46:53.080 --> 02:46:58.280]  always adding more of this stuff because it's part of an architecture it's part
[02:46:58.280 --> 02:47:03.440]  of a rollout plan it's part of a blueprint Jordan in Texas so here's
[02:47:03.440 --> 02:47:11.480]  another one has Google Panda update hurt demand media stock and yeah there it
[02:47:11.480 --> 02:47:16.800]  goes there's the news reporting how that print that for me how these systems
[02:47:16.800 --> 02:47:21.440]  are really shutting down the free flow of information on the web I mean it's
[02:47:21.440 --> 02:47:26.000]  it's what it's designed to do ladies and gentlemen they're putting the bigger
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:32.480]  gates in the gatekeeper slots of the web Jordan in Texas you're on the air thanks
[02:47:32.480 --> 02:47:38.120]  for taking my call again welcome I think we'll keep you Alex two questions do you
[02:47:38.120 --> 02:47:41.560]  have to know the 9-11 documentary is supposed to come out on June 6 because I
[02:47:41.560 --> 02:47:46.040]  can't remember it had Dave Mustaine and I think Rosie O'Donnell if I remember right
[02:47:46.040 --> 02:47:51.740]  and to what was it the iPhone 4 you were talking about with a guest I think
[02:47:51.740 --> 02:47:57.360]  about six weeks ago did it like you could scan other people's phones and get
[02:47:57.360 --> 02:48:01.600]  like other data and their address and stuff like that I want to find that
[02:48:01.600 --> 02:48:04.600]  episode on present plan of TV so I can download it because I have a subscription
[02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:07.560]  none of my friends seem to believe about this stuff so if you could help me on
[02:48:07.560 --> 02:48:15.520]  well no I mean the NSA and the and the threat fusion centers admittedly have
[02:48:15.520 --> 02:48:20.240]  antenna systems that can grab all the cell phone data and go through it they
[02:48:20.240 --> 02:48:23.520]  also in Michigan and other areas I don't remember I was like a month ago I
[02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:28.120]  covered that I can't read the exact day was it was in the Detroit Free Press it
[02:48:28.120 --> 02:48:31.160]  was everywhere where they pull you over for speeding and then grab your phone
[02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:35.280]  and plug it in and it has a code breaker when then seconds breaks the code and
[02:48:35.280 --> 02:48:39.720]  downloads everything in your phone and then about two weeks ago federal court
[02:48:39.720 --> 02:48:44.760]  in San Francisco rule they can do that so that's all over the news if you just
[02:48:44.760 --> 02:48:51.840]  search police taking cell phone data without warrants it's all over the news
[02:48:51.840 --> 02:48:55.080]  okay and what about the documentary the 9-11 document do you have to remember
[02:48:55.080 --> 02:48:58.560]  what I'm talking about on that one no I didn't know Dave Mustaine is in the 9-11
[02:48:58.560 --> 02:49:03.120]  truth documentary yeah it is I thought it was for about probably good month or

[02:55:16.960 --> 02:55:21.760]  appreciate you taking my call here I just wanted to let you know I graduated
[02:55:21.760 --> 02:55:28.840]  from prestigious college last summer film school and one of my private loan
[02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:34.120]  lenders Sally May maybe you've heard of them they ended up pulling the rug out
[02:55:34.120 --> 02:55:38.240]  from underneath me about a semester before I graduated so I literally was
[02:55:38.240 --> 02:55:42.520]  almost not able to graduate I didn't have the finances to do it so I ended up
[02:55:42.520 --> 02:55:46.640]  going to the college and just begging them for some assistance they ended up
[02:55:46.640 --> 02:55:50.760]  giving me a private loan through the school and one of the conditions and I
[02:55:50.760 --> 02:55:54.760]  didn't understand this until well after the fact one of the conditions of them
[02:55:54.760 --> 02:55:58.840]  giving me this private loan to finish my schooling was that they're going to
[02:55:58.840 --> 02:56:03.840]  withhold my diploma and my transcripts until after I pay this loan back well
[02:56:03.840 --> 02:56:07.320]  here does a year later I'm unemployed because I don't have my diploma and I
[02:56:07.320 --> 02:56:11.680]  don't have my transcripts the school's withholding that stuff and I'm kind of
[02:56:11.680 --> 02:56:16.400]  you know I'm sitting here doomed now I got Sally May pestering me constantly for
[02:56:16.400 --> 02:56:21.400]  the $150,000 that I owe them have you heard about the SWAT team visits people
[02:56:21.400 --> 02:56:26.240]  are getting now no what's that now the Department of Education now has federal
[02:56:26.240 --> 02:56:30.440]  good enforces that SWAT team you to for unpaid student loans even though there's
[02:56:30.440 --> 02:56:35.560]  no law and they and it's against the law to send that for debt collection why
[02:56:35.560 --> 02:56:39.160]  shouldn't they I mean the FBI now it's gonna come in your house without warrants
[02:56:39.160 --> 02:56:43.040]  and dig through your trash what's the big deal well right I've been getting
[02:56:43.040 --> 02:56:46.920]  phone calls from their goon squad they call my house they call my parents house
[02:56:46.920 --> 02:56:51.080]  threatening this that and the other thing I mean I've been considering trying
[02:56:51.080 --> 02:56:55.440]  to do chapter 11 bankruptcy just to get these guys off my case but then of
[02:56:55.440 --> 02:56:58.720]  course my mom being a co-signer they just go after her and take her house so I'm
[02:56:58.720 --> 02:57:03.720]  doomed either way and so the banks made all this up out of nothing and by
[02:57:03.720 --> 02:57:07.640]  throwing all this money at education it massively inflated the cost of
[02:57:07.640 --> 02:57:12.640]  education I hear you it's just terrible my friend and it's gonna get a lot worse
[02:57:12.640 --> 02:57:16.760]  I'm really concerned I thought globalism was gonna be great for our
[02:57:16.760 --> 02:57:21.200]  country oh sorry it killed it but the globalist answer is more globalism but
[02:57:21.200 --> 02:57:28.560]  don't worry don't worry they've got was it three million dollars plus for for
[02:57:28.560 --> 02:57:33.800]  chimpanzees to watch pornography I'm not kidding that was in the news last week
[02:57:33.800 --> 02:57:39.360]  millions for shrimp on treadmills and don't worry here in Austin that they
[02:57:39.360 --> 02:57:45.840]  have taxpayers have to pay for city and county paid for abortions but if you
[02:57:45.840 --> 02:57:50.920]  don't give them all that money a SWAT team's coming here's BBC countries
[02:57:50.920 --> 02:57:57.080]  pledge four point three billion in funding for child vaccines because they
[02:57:57.080 --> 02:58:01.080]  care so much about the children and of course that'll be a big boondoggle of
[02:58:01.080 --> 02:58:06.240]  money paid to the big pharma companies of your tax money countries of pledge and
[02:58:06.240 --> 02:58:09.640]  unprecedented four point three billion to help vaccinate children against
