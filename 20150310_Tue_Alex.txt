[01:31.200 --> 01:36.560]  amendment is being prepared to be dismantled. Simpson Brenner one of the
[01:36.560 --> 01:40.160]  globalist members of Congress does some good things some bad things introduces
[01:40.160 --> 01:44.400]  the real ID act but then you know supports Justin Amash and folks that are
[01:44.400 --> 01:52.840]  Ron Paul ask but he now has come out and wants to quote abolish the ATF but the
[01:52.840 --> 01:58.040]  problem on that is they would just put the agency and the very people under the
[01:58.040 --> 02:04.880]  DEA and the FBI now these are more competent groups the DEA and the FBI
[02:04.880 --> 02:09.600]  competent and carrying on globalist crime in many cases and can you imagine
[02:09.600 --> 02:16.080]  the giant war on drugs apparatus and the asset forfeiture seizure apparatus
[02:16.080 --> 02:19.920]  that's federalizing local police everywhere when they switch to the war on
[02:19.920 --> 02:24.080]  guns with all these nickel-and-dime rules and regulations that aren't even law
[02:24.080 --> 02:29.800]  this is the war on the American gun owner promised by the globalist this is a
[02:29.800 --> 02:36.120]  full mega alert ladies and gentlemen and in fact today I want to open the phones
[02:36.120 --> 02:40.600]  up and I want to ask the listeners what are you going to do to defend the second
[02:40.600 --> 02:46.120]  amendment tomorrow I'm going to talk about positive things and uplifting the
[02:46.120 --> 02:50.400]  human spirit and how to transcend the globalist at least at a gut level so
[02:50.400 --> 02:53.600]  that their evil doesn't get us too depressed while we fight them so we're
[02:53.600 --> 02:56.960]  in the world but not of it I was gonna do that today but but the second amendment
[02:56.960 --> 03:01.640]  issue is so incredibly central it is second amendment today when we talk
[03:01.640 --> 03:06.200]  about callers and throughout the compendium of the broadcast interspersed
[03:06.200 --> 03:10.880]  with literally hundreds of different incredibly important news stories that
[03:10.880 --> 03:16.000]  we're going to attempt to cover but it's on we know the enemy's plan we know
[03:16.000 --> 03:21.760]  their operations we know how they behave and now they've just got to sell this to
[03:21.760 --> 03:26.160]  local government and the police and the military and the FBI and the ATF and
[03:26.160 --> 03:29.960]  others so that they believe most of them actually believe they're doing a hard
[03:29.960 --> 03:33.680]  job and the world's against them and they get you know attacked unfairly and
[03:33.680 --> 03:37.360]  things get spun I mean here's a great example and we'll cover this after the
[03:37.360 --> 03:43.800]  break South Carolina National Guard conducts door-to-door wellness checks
[03:43.800 --> 03:49.560]  gun confiscation exercises now now now in this compendium if if if the police
[03:49.560 --> 03:53.880]  and military can understand this and the public can understand this it's what I
[03:53.880 --> 03:57.040]  call a rosetta stone through this you can decode everything this is just a
[03:57.040 --> 04:01.200]  snapshot example microcosm that hooks into everything you understand the
[04:01.200 --> 04:05.720]  micro you understand the macro the National Guard are really hard-working

[04:17.280 --> 04:20.840]  get the National Guard even regular army involved in door-to-door behavior we've
[04:20.840 --> 04:24.600]  documented and it's been in the news that it is part of the integration of
[04:24.600 --> 04:29.160]  military into civilian life for the oppression to come so they carry out a
[04:29.160 --> 04:33.800]  legitimate helpful mission gather intel though that that's been fed to health
[04:33.800 --> 04:38.960]  departments to be used in spy databases on citizens so they send out smiling
[04:38.960 --> 04:42.400]  faces knowing that there's a very positive view of the military and of the
[04:42.400 --> 04:47.880]  National Guard they use them open the door to let the nice guy in to then let

[09:28.920 --> 09:33.520]  they're not going to use a bunch of wordsmithing and manipulation to hide
[09:33.520 --> 09:38.920]  what they're doing Obama has promised to destroy the second amendment his
[09:38.920 --> 09:44.320]  criminal attorney general was caught shipping guns into Mexico and the
[09:44.320 --> 09:48.800]  memos came out CBS News to demonize and false flag and set up the second
[09:48.800 --> 09:53.320]  amendment this is really happening we have on a host of issues open borders
[09:53.320 --> 09:56.960]  total treason without even a law the president is just legalizing all the
[09:56.960 --> 10:01.040]  illegals giving him social security cards that's in the news today we have the
[10:01.040 --> 10:05.240]  president shutting off her energy capacity and moving our jobs overseas by
[10:05.240 --> 10:11.640]  design on record globalism to make us dependent outside of law the carbon
[10:11.640 --> 10:15.600]  taxes outside of law the shutting down of the rest of our infrastructure
[10:15.600 --> 10:19.280]  outside of law we have the president launching military operations outside of
[10:19.280 --> 10:23.720]  Congress and outside of law we have the president engaging in selective
[10:23.720 --> 10:27.320]  enforcement via Obamacare against his political enemies engaged in IRS
[10:27.320 --> 10:32.000]  witch hunts on record against whole political classes they don't like with
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.800]  MSNBC traitorously admitting that they are targeting conservatives and saying
[10:36.800 --> 10:41.720]  good go after the Tea Party with the IRS not even the Nazis openly got on the
[10:41.720 --> 10:47.000]  radio and said go take all of our enemies money they just did it so this is
[10:47.000 --> 10:51.440]  the beginning of economic embargo we have articles out of Nevada this isn't
[10:51.440 --> 10:56.240]  out of England where parents can't adopt children if they have concealed carry
[10:56.240 --> 11:04.880]  permits you see we are the new Jews the new gypsies the the new underclass if

[11:09.120 --> 11:14.800]  game for the new totalitarians to exercise these operations on us but then
[11:14.800 --> 11:19.080]  once they're done they're going to move on to everybody as well but this is the
[11:19.080 --> 11:26.920]  game being played right now epic news and I use that word a lot because what
[11:26.920 --> 11:33.840]  we're seeing is gargantuan power grabs of the internet of you name it now the
[11:33.840 --> 11:39.000]  Republicans are proposing and look out they're proposing abolishing the ATF but
[11:39.000 --> 11:42.400]  that only means like they abolish the border patrol and just put it under ice
[11:42.400 --> 11:50.880]  six years ago no they are moving for a long time ATF under the DEA and the FBI
[11:50.880 --> 11:54.360]  we're gonna be talking about that with David Knight here in just a moment to
[11:54.360 --> 11:59.440]  give them the incredible reach of informants and power to now totally
[11:59.440 --> 12:04.280]  criminalized gun owners with a bunch of invisible regulations and red tape to
[12:04.280 --> 12:08.920]  then throw people in jail for bullets for gun accessories you name it the real
[12:08.920 --> 12:13.160]  reign of terror that Bloomberg and others promised that was microcosm in
[12:13.160 --> 12:16.360]  California the last three years with the Bloomberg headline gun
[12:16.360 --> 12:20.680]  confiscations began in California it's coming the veterans aren't able to buy
[12:20.680 --> 12:25.560]  guns in many cases now no crimes no record no nothing it's here totalitarianism
[12:25.560 --> 12:29.840]  via bureaucracy incrementally being turned up but a certain point even if
[12:29.840 --> 12:33.600]  you incrementally you're turning it up it starts to boil here's the articles on
[12:33.600 --> 12:38.520]  info wars dot com right now 52 senators and we need to be hammering this on
[12:38.520 --> 12:44.120]  info wars dot com and we are 52 senators warrant of sweeping ammo bans say
[12:44.120 --> 12:49.040]  second amendment is quote at risk absolutely the plan has always been to
[12:49.040 --> 12:53.160]  be able to ban one type of rifle ammo claiming it can kill cops well of course
[12:53.160 --> 12:58.960]  it can kill cops and then I mean any ammo can kill somebody and then expanding
[12:58.960 --> 13:05.680]  it out basically to everything 52 senators warrant of sweeping ammo bans
[13:05.680 --> 13:09.880]  say second amendment at risk a majority in both the Senate and the House 52
[13:09.880 --> 13:15.560]  senators 238 House members have joined to oppose the Obama administration's move
[13:15.560 --> 13:18.800]  well let's see him actually do something to ban a popular type of ammo
[13:18.800 --> 13:25.720]  used in upselling AR-15 rifles and pistols because it pierces police body
[13:25.720 --> 13:30.040]  armor a week after House members led by judiciary committee representative Bob
[13:30.040 --> 13:35.120]  Goodlaw today if I say that right sent a letter of opposition to the Bureau of
[13:35.120 --> 13:38.320]  Alcohol Tobacco Farms and explosives Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman

[13:43.680 --> 13:48.960]  going to be reading some of what they had to say coming up but if you add this
[13:48.960 --> 13:53.320]  into the entire attack profile the entire constellation of what's happening
[13:53.320 --> 13:57.600]  it shows that the enemy is very confident well they shouldn't be in every
[13:57.600 --> 14:01.960]  poll number they're plunging they're in deep political trouble Hillary's in big
[14:01.960 --> 14:06.480]  trouble Obama's in big trouble you read the news headlines even his own
[14:06.480 --> 14:09.680]  faithful or losing faith in their Messiah the Lord and Savior Barack
[14:09.680 --> 14:14.440]  who sent Obama to quote Jamie Fox so why are they so confident because they have
[14:14.440 --> 14:18.600]  globalist backing they have an agenda they have stage terror up their sleeve
[14:18.600 --> 14:23.640]  new big wars up their sleeve economic crises up their sleeve and most
[14:23.640 --> 14:28.800]  importantly they have traitorous Republicans like John Boehner and others
[14:28.800 --> 14:32.960]  protecting the entire agenda keeping Obamacare in place as it rapes the
[14:32.960 --> 14:36.040]  American people and breaks our financial back destroys our health care system
[14:36.040 --> 14:39.840]  and federalizes it as a new enforcement spy grid breaking the
[14:39.840 --> 14:43.880]  country's back ending sovereignty ending the borders saying you know
[14:43.880 --> 14:48.880]  worldwide CNN every day as articles come to America it's all free ha ha the

[15:00.040 --> 15:05.760]  melting down is being dismantled in front of us and if they can get the
[15:05.760 --> 15:10.440]  second amendment and if the Republican leadership can ride herd and just put
[15:10.440 --> 15:14.400]  out you know a lawsuit or complain and act like they're doing something and
[15:14.400 --> 15:19.400]  move it on into a process it's over we need investigations we need hearings we

[15:24.680 --> 15:28.880]  we're on the defense and the best offense is ladies and gentlemen to take
[15:28.880 --> 15:33.200]  action to tell the truth and to not back down so they've been attacking us the
[15:33.200 --> 15:37.800]  best defense is an aggressive offense we don't have any more time our worst
[15:37.800 --> 15:42.600]  fears have been confirmed we're dealing with a red level hardcore scientific
[15:42.600 --> 15:47.160]  global technocratic attempted takeover of the United States ahead of the
[15:47.160 --> 15:51.160]  worldwide financial collapse and under this new system Katie bar the door

[16:22.920 --> 16:27.440]  now in the streets with signs you name it aggressively so they back down we've
[16:27.440 --> 16:31.520]  done it before when they ran their Sandy Hook hop and others we can do it again
[16:31.520 --> 16:35.480]  if we rally David Knight absolutely Alex you know there's a group of pro
[16:35.480 --> 16:39.000]  lifers who are very upset with John Boehner because he'd promised that he
[16:39.000 --> 16:44.440]  was going to pass a late-term abortion bill in January of course he hasn't done
[16:44.440 --> 16:47.600]  that like hasn't done anything else so they're going to Capitol Hill they said
[16:47.600 --> 16:50.480]  they're going to sit at his office they're going to get arrested whatever
[16:50.480 --> 16:54.520]  people need to get upset about these issues and of course that's a key issue
[16:54.520 --> 17:00.920]  so is the takedown of the second amendment my take on this was positive
[17:00.920 --> 17:05.280]  yesterday because Alex we see so many different bureaucracies that are trying
[17:05.280 --> 17:11.080]  to expand their territory look at the FCC going over the internet grabbing my
[17:11.080 --> 17:15.560]  different agency absolutely Anthony Gutiarty talked about how the FTC the
[17:15.560 --> 17:20.040]  Federal Trade Commission is trying to extend its authority over the internet
[17:20.040 --> 17:24.200]  by going through the ad portals essentially and so we see all these
[17:24.200 --> 17:28.680]  these organizations these bureaucracies that exist permanently they're not
[17:28.680 --> 17:31.840]  elected by the people they're not accountable to the people and so we
[17:31.840 --> 17:35.760]  have absolutely no control we can we can have a comment period where we can
[17:35.760 --> 17:39.840]  send them our comments about their proposed legislation they don't have to
[17:39.840 --> 17:42.720]  listen to us as that if they don't listen to us there's nothing we can do if you
[17:42.720 --> 17:46.360]  look at what the FCC just did they just passed this legislation without even
[17:46.360 --> 17:51.120]  having no comment nobody can see it not even the congressmen have seen it a
[17:51.120 --> 17:55.440]  week after they passed this so when I looked at this and said when he said
[17:55.440 --> 17:59.600]  let's let's eliminate the ATF my first reaction was absolutely that's what I
[17:59.600 --> 18:03.160]  would do if I was there I would go on the offensive I would say let's shut down
[18:03.160 --> 18:06.760]  these bureaucracies that are metastasized into their own little separate
[18:06.760 --> 18:10.720]  empires I think what he's the only positive thing that would come out of
[18:10.720 --> 18:14.160]  this he's going to move the functionality as you point out to the FBI to the DEA
[18:14.160 --> 18:18.720]  they could be more ruthlessly enforced and we know of course that the FBI has
[18:18.720 --> 18:22.360]  set people up with false flags we just talked to Barrett Brown yesterday about
[18:22.360 --> 18:26.840]  how the FBI brought all kinds of false charges against him misconstrued Twitter
[18:26.840 --> 18:30.360]  statements that he'd made he said we no longer have a rule of law we have a rule
[18:30.360 --> 18:35.000]  of law enforcement and of course that would continue but on the other hand we
[18:35.000 --> 18:39.120]  would get rid of this upper echelon of ATF management that's been responsible
[18:39.120 --> 18:44.120]  for Fast and Furious that is working with Obama to create a situation where
[18:44.120 --> 18:47.880]  they totally bypass this absolutely Congress and neuter the Second Amendment
[18:47.880 --> 18:51.400]  by going after ammunition and Obama has been going after ammunition from the
[18:51.400 --> 18:55.640]  very beginning and that's the mark the power structure goes with this
[18:55.640 --> 19:00.600]  senatorial idea then you know it's bad news I'm just pointing out how you can
[19:00.600 --> 19:04.520]  go from one incompetent agency to one of these really dangerous dark agencies
[19:04.520 --> 19:08.960]  and they do plan to have a war on guns like they've had a war on quote drugs
[19:08.960 --> 19:13.200]  that's right out of the mouth of Rahm Emanuel they don't want people put on a
[19:13.200 --> 19:16.760]  no-fly list to be able to buy guns no judge no jury so we're going to this
[19:16.760 --> 19:22.120]  extra judicial system whether it's the internet or whether it's borders we are
[19:22.120 --> 19:27.160]  moving to a completely dictatorial model the good news is Hillary Clinton may
[19:27.160 --> 19:31.080]  not be able to survive what's happening the sense is the people are very angry
[19:31.080 --> 19:35.040]  very upset the worm is politically turning not just here but all over the
[19:35.040 --> 19:39.360]  world but I totally agree with you David that this is a very important time
[19:39.360 --> 19:42.080]  for everyone to be aware of what's happening and to get aggressive and
[19:42.080 --> 19:45.400]  let's expand on that when the Republicans didn't have a majority in the
[19:45.400 --> 19:50.440]  Senate but they'd had a smaller majority in the House last year 2014 they were
[19:50.440 --> 19:54.920]  able to pass up a partial birth abortion ban and in the House the Senate
[19:54.920 --> 19:59.480]  killed it now we have the Senate have the House they have no excuse so they

[24:25.920 --> 24:29.880]  Natalie News anchor co-hosting the broadcast with us from Austin Texas
[24:29.880 --> 24:37.680]  and I'm really glad that David brought up in conjunction with this whole second
[24:37.680 --> 24:42.160]  amendment story this whole second amendment move I mean it's really
[24:42.160 --> 24:48.600]  happening that at the same time the Republicans had the votes in the House
[24:48.600 --> 24:53.720]  and Senate and could have banned partial birth abortion but didn't do it they
[24:53.720 --> 24:58.080]  could repeal Obamacare they won't even change any of it they could control our
[24:58.080 --> 25:02.080]  borders they won't do it last week they sent Obama during Netanyahu's speech
[25:02.080 --> 25:07.400]  and admitted distraction now the blank check to just do it every once with
[25:07.400 --> 25:10.360]  Homeland Security no strings attached because Congress passes the money and
[25:10.360 --> 25:14.560]  says what it's for but you said you know what here's a blank check baby here's
[25:14.560 --> 25:18.000]  here's over a hundred billion dollars just do whatever you want to have fun
[25:18.000 --> 25:24.920]  it's all yours it's all yours bounty hunter we are just being thrown down the
[25:24.920 --> 25:31.160]  trash can here we are being looted seven ways to Sunday just like China for over
[25:31.160 --> 25:34.440]  a hundred years by the Western powers was before the Boxer Rebellion look it
[25:34.440 --> 25:37.520]  up and they use drugs shipped in by British intelligence to bring down
[25:37.520 --> 25:42.840]  China it's the same story to divide and conquer the country and for all of you
[25:42.840 --> 25:45.960]  out there that are part of the system when it's all said and done you're gonna
[25:45.960 --> 25:50.200]  have your wealth looted as well this is extremely predatory it's going to
[25:50.200 --> 25:55.560]  basically the bottom and it's got to be reversed so again I asked the listeners
[25:55.560 --> 26:00.720]  we're gonna open the phones up coming up in the next segment I asked the listeners
[26:00.720 --> 26:06.720]  what do we do to point out that a even if Congress passed an ammo ban it would
[26:06.720 --> 26:10.760]  be unconstitutional this isn't even a law this isn't even about the Second
[26:10.760 --> 26:14.640]  Amendment now it's about dictatorship of the executive branch in these
[26:14.640 --> 26:20.360]  bureaucracies that literally are run by a bunch of corporate chiefs in
[26:20.360 --> 26:29.960]  revolving doors the former you know head of Monsanto runs the EPA excuse me the
[26:29.960 --> 26:36.320]  FDA and then they also got their people inside the the eat I mean just makes the
[26:36.320 --> 26:41.120]  hedge spin when you look at almost every agency and it's a revolving door
[26:41.120 --> 26:46.360]  where Monsanto's got their people in the FDA and the EPA and it's the same for
[26:46.360 --> 26:50.920]  every agency this is how we've been completely sold out and now they're
[26:50.920 --> 26:55.080]  coming for the second amendment folks that's what I keep saying if they get
[26:55.080 --> 26:58.480]  away with dictatorial actions at a level never before seen and even mainstream
[26:58.480 --> 27:02.240]  media and members of Congress say Obama is acting like a dictator the bigger
[27:02.240 --> 27:06.840]  issue is why is Congress green lighting everything and just handing him the
[27:06.840 --> 27:10.320]  tacit power David Knight the toll-free number for listeners to join us is
[27:10.320 --> 27:16.920]  800-259-9231 are you angry are you focused you understand this is make
[27:16.920 --> 27:20.800]  it or break it we're entering a major sector with a globalist are probing and
[27:20.800 --> 27:27.160]  moving on every front this is an incredible time to be alive 800-259-9231
[27:27.160 --> 27:31.480]  what about the pro-lifers David I mean they've got the right idea everywhere
[27:31.480 --> 27:35.880]  Boehner goes he should be besieged he's gonna allow the continued murder of all
[27:35.880 --> 27:39.640]  these children people have to get angry enough Alex where they stand up and they
[27:39.640 --> 27:45.000]  do something and that's why when I looked at this initially I'm so concerned
[27:45.000 --> 27:47.840]  about the passivity of Congress and this is something that's been going on for
[27:47.840 --> 27:51.320]  decades they have been turning over their legislative function to these
[27:51.320 --> 27:56.760]  bureaucracies that they've created like the ATF like the FDA whatever every one
[27:56.760 --> 28:00.520]  of these bureaucracies the EPA going after wood stoes as we talked about
[28:00.520 --> 28:07.080]  yesterday they just keep expanding their reach into our lives without any reason
[28:07.080 --> 28:10.960]  and they're their little governments unto themselves they write the laws they
[28:10.960 --> 28:15.160]  legislate they enforce the laws they have their own courts and so when I saw
[28:15.160 --> 28:20.000]  somebody in Congress saying let's go on the offensive let's take down one of
[28:20.000 --> 28:23.800]  these that would be a lesson to all of the agency so from that standpoint I
[28:23.800 --> 28:26.560]  think it's a good thing now of course the government is still going to be coming
[28:26.560 --> 28:29.280]  after the Second Amendment it would be different agencies that be coming after
[28:29.280 --> 28:32.200]  it one of the things Alex that I thought was interesting I think they're
[28:32.200 --> 28:36.080]  losing the hearts and minds of the people certainly on the war on drugs we've
[28:36.080 --> 28:40.160]  seen this over and over again state after state to the Second Amendment yeah
[28:40.160 --> 28:45.840]  yeah and so if they were to take the alcohol and tobacco to the DEA that
[28:45.840 --> 28:49.880]  would be one way to kind of placate that powerful bureaucracy which in and of
[28:49.880 --> 28:54.080]  itself is like an own its own separate government that be kind of way to the
[28:54.080 --> 28:59.360]  DEA will now be involved in alcohol and tobacco I mean yeah I mean just deliver people to be
[28:59.360 --> 29:04.320]  tortured in Afghanistan to the DEA the DEA is one of the scariest most clandestine
[29:04.320 --> 29:08.080]  operative groups out there but nobody thinks of it as sexy like the Navy
[29:08.080 --> 29:12.520]  Seals of the CIA because the DEA is smart enough to stay below the radar I mean
[29:12.520 --> 29:17.840]  they are super wicked super bad I mean I mean they bring in the narcotics folks
[29:17.840 --> 29:21.840]  you talk about fast and furious I mean that everything that the DEA has been
[29:21.840 --> 29:25.120]  doing for decades has been an entire fast and furious operation running both
[29:25.120 --> 29:31.120]  sides of it absolutely I mean I shake to think of the DEA over the Second
[29:31.120 --> 29:35.400]  Amendment so I mean we're talking about a lower small two inch demon right now
[29:35.400 --> 29:38.560]  the ATF that everybody hates they've been hated since they were the revenuers
[29:38.560 --> 29:42.760]  you know 150 years ago going after moonshiners to a guerrilla that
[29:42.760 --> 29:56.880]  laid 600 pounds I mean we're talking about a 600 pound gorilla of the DEA we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the G.C.N. radio network

[33:13.400 --> 33:17.360]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we have Alex Jones
[33:17.360 --> 33:20.120]  joining us we've been talking about the Second Amendment that's going to be our
[33:20.120 --> 33:25.800]  focus today we also in other news we see that the CDC is back at the two-lane
[33:25.800 --> 33:31.080]  bio weapons lab trying to find out how this got out of lab these are gain of
[33:31.080 --> 33:35.720]  function experiments trying to weaponize bacteria we have our federal
[33:35.720 --> 33:39.680]  government weaponizing their powers and that's what we're talking about with the
[33:39.680 --> 33:44.880]  Second Amendment how did we get these clueless people who are weaponizing and
[33:44.880 --> 33:50.040]  adding function to their powers how do we bring them in is the way we do it
[33:50.040 --> 33:54.200]  with a band on the ATF do we disassemble the ATF and move its
[33:54.200 --> 33:58.920]  responsibilities to the FBI and the DEA how do we move back as a people
[33:58.920 --> 34:03.680]  certainly Congress is not going to do what do you think Alex well David we
[34:03.680 --> 34:07.920]  have to have a national debate about what it is to be a free country versus a
[34:07.920 --> 34:12.360]  tyranny and we have to admit to ourselves that we have fallen as a nation
[34:12.360 --> 34:18.360]  the minute that we rationalized killing babies in the womb then old people were
[34:18.360 --> 34:21.880]  going to be worthless the veterans were going to be worthless the troops were
[34:21.880 --> 34:24.800]  going to be worthless our women would be worthless our men would be worthless
[34:24.800 --> 34:28.800]  our children would be worthless we have been chopping our children up and
[34:28.800 --> 34:32.280]  throwing them in trash cans and now using them for Pepsi flavoring and now
[34:32.280 --> 34:40.280]  using them for vaccine flesh production stock for so long that now so what if
[34:40.280 --> 34:45.120]  we've got one in 56 with autism from one in 25,000 30 years ago so what if
[34:45.120 --> 34:49.320]  breast cancer is up 3,000 percent so what if it comes out in big British
[34:49.320 --> 34:53.120]  government studies confirming the Harvard studies that fluoride makes you fat
[34:53.120 --> 35:00.120]  unhappy and very depressed and makes your thyroid fail and your pancreas fail so
[35:00.120 --> 35:03.760]  what I mean it's just an attitude of where we've been conditioned and have
[35:03.760 --> 35:10.840]  adapted by having our wheel broken to just accept anything and now we've seen
[35:10.840 --> 35:16.400]  the power grabs going on for a long time after Kennedy right through to
[35:16.400 --> 35:23.760]  President Obama and now it's just a bum rush the dam has broken and they are
[35:23.760 --> 35:27.120]  going to probably stage on their mass shooting and just announce start turning
[35:27.120 --> 35:31.760]  your guns in it'll be first turn in the AR 15 so the M4s and then they won't
[35:31.760 --> 35:35.160]  have to stage terror attacks people will resist they'll be called terrorists in
[35:35.160 --> 35:38.920]  the Civil War will start then the occupying government will probably blow
[35:38.920 --> 35:42.640]  up federal buildings and blame it on us and undoubtedly this show within
[35:42.640 --> 35:47.240]  minutes of a federal building going up in a mushroom cloud my face will be on
[35:47.240 --> 35:50.760]  national television and they will say it's all my fault and that's why we're
[35:50.760 --> 35:55.160]  here every day exposing that it's not our fault we're trying to stop it we
[35:55.160 --> 35:59.240]  understand the enemy operation they're going to blame drudge report they're
[35:59.240 --> 36:03.240]  going to blame Rush Limbaugh they're going to blame any media they don't
[36:03.240 --> 36:07.840]  control doesn't mean drudge is perfect doesn't mean I'm perfect doesn't mean
[36:07.840 --> 36:11.720]  Limbaugh's perfect it just means we've supported the Second Amendment we've
[36:11.720 --> 36:16.000]  been pro-life we've been against collectivism we have to be silenced
[36:16.000 --> 36:20.400]  discredited destroyed and world net dailies the same talk radios the same
[36:20.400 --> 36:25.240]  that's what the FCC takeover of the web is about this is it I mean every
[36:25.240 --> 36:31.240]  instinct I've got is to haul anchor and get out of this country my flesh my flesh
[36:31.240 --> 36:36.280]  wants to flee to the South Pacific my flesh wants to flee to New Zealand my
[36:36.280 --> 36:40.160]  flesh wants to flee to Chile and you know just get some cottage up in the
[36:40.160 --> 36:43.680]  mountains in a low crime area and get to know the locals and hope everybody's
[36:43.680 --> 36:48.640]  nice you know and go local that's what my flesh wants to do but see it's the
[36:48.640 --> 36:51.640]  spirit that's going to defeat this evil and my spirit says you're going to stay
[36:51.640 --> 36:54.600]  here you're going to fight this you're going to go on to the end whatever the
[36:54.600 --> 36:57.880]  cost may be and what we've done as a culture in a society is we've gone with
[36:57.880 --> 37:00.560]  our flesh I don't have a baby with this woman I'm just going to pay for an
[37:00.560 --> 37:04.680]  abortion it's not really human and then they give you a rationale and then oh I'm
[37:04.680 --> 37:08.360]  not gonna worry about my grandparents or my parents I'm just gonna stick them in
[37:08.360 --> 37:11.040]  the facility and so what if they euthanize them basically with morphine
[37:11.040 --> 37:14.360]  you know they've had a good life and now whatever and oh you know what you know
[37:14.360 --> 37:17.800]  I've got a handicap kid let's go ahead and kill them up to age five now the
[37:17.800 --> 37:20.400]  mainline liberal publications are calling for killing children up to age
[37:20.400 --> 37:23.920]  five or even if you just don't like how your kid looks and oh let's have designer
[37:23.920 --> 37:29.520]  babies and oh oh oh oh let's let's take children from parents to give them to
[37:29.520 --> 37:33.480]  quote gay families but then let's not let people that own guns and have no
[37:33.480 --> 37:38.680]  criminal record in Nevada adopt a child you see it's discriminatory they come
[37:38.680 --> 37:42.280]  in and they claim they're here to empower and they play off our bleeding
[37:42.280 --> 37:47.480]  hearts who are true classical liberals at heart in a Jeffersonian way to go
[37:47.480 --> 37:50.880]  yeah you're right let's pay for the immigrants to come have their babies
[37:50.880 --> 37:55.400]  here yeah you're right let's let's let's turn our guns in so children don't get
[37:55.400 --> 38:01.080]  hurt anymore it's all about guilting us into total and complete submission and
[38:01.080 --> 38:04.840]  we just have to break with that guilt break with that being bullied and
[38:04.840 --> 38:08.440]  hen packed into a corner that we're going to submit to the system and we're
[38:08.440 --> 38:12.160]  going to comply and we're going to bow down and we're going to go along with
[38:12.160 --> 38:16.240]  them and we have to really see how epic this takeover is I mean look at the
[38:16.240 --> 38:19.120]  second amendment issue then we're gonna get David's take and start taking some
[38:19.120 --> 38:23.520]  phone calls and David can see the callers on screen he can he can call
[38:23.520 --> 38:26.280]  those out and go to those as well the fact I've now got the call screen thank
[38:26.280 --> 38:28.520]  you I haven't gone on the road in a while so I'm working out some of the
[38:28.520 --> 38:32.880]  bugs the crews doing a great job look at this headline info wars.com and
[38:32.880 --> 38:36.080]  prisonplanet.com that Dove tells everything we're talking about and
[38:36.080 --> 38:42.280]  within this is a microcosm to see the mind control South Carolina National
[38:42.280 --> 38:47.800]  Guard conducts door-to-door wellness checks gun confiscation exercises troops
[38:47.800 --> 38:52.840]  unknowingly trained for martial law excellent article and it goes into the
[38:52.840 --> 38:58.120]  breakdown of the entire situation I think we probably should play this
[38:58.120 --> 39:03.320]  report coming up that Rob do shot about it operation vigilant guardian which we
[39:03.320 --> 39:09.520]  exposed five years ago as an exercise to set up gun confiscations and in turn
[39:09.520 --> 39:14.440]  citizens is being run across the country under the guise of helping
[39:14.440 --> 39:19.720]  citizens even though we've seen at National Guard go door-to-door and the
[39:19.720 --> 39:24.040]  video report that needs to go viral breaks it down that see they tried this
[39:24.040 --> 39:30.160]  five years ago and it was even in local newspapers we covered it to have them
[39:30.160 --> 39:34.680]  drill to quote in Arcadia Iowa in places to take the guns to confiscate the
[39:34.680 --> 39:38.920]  firearms we had kernels on who admitted it it was a big national story so then
[39:38.920 --> 39:42.400]  that backfired so now they're calling it wellness checks so the troops
[39:42.400 --> 39:46.200]  themselves are just being trained to go door-to-door and ask social worker
[39:46.200 --> 39:49.800]  questions and put it in a database they're not bad people because the meal
[39:49.800 --> 39:52.520]  say oh you're saying the troops are bad no they're not they're being put in a
[39:52.520 --> 39:57.080]  bad position so they're the loving good face that people trust that there's a
[39:57.080 --> 40:01.000]  higher approval rating for National Guard and in military than there is for
[40:01.000 --> 40:05.320]  any other government agency or group so they want to use them as their front to
[40:05.320 --> 40:10.080]  condition and prepare the public for this and it's absolutely dastardly and
[40:10.080 --> 40:16.000]  it ties in again to the compendium of the takeover that we see I mean David do
[40:16.000 --> 40:19.480]  you have any doubt do you think I'm being alarmist or what does your gut tell
[40:19.480 --> 40:25.080]  you as a engineer a father an entrepreneur a business owner somebody
[40:25.080 --> 40:30.520]  who studied history I'm concerned that we're not info wars isn't taking this
[40:30.520 --> 40:34.520]  as seriously as we should that I'm not that I've been too long close to
[40:34.520 --> 40:38.000]  tyranny fighting it that I've almost become comfortable with it and pretty
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.280]  much just expect all this evil to come when I forget all the animating contest
[40:42.280 --> 40:45.960]  of liberty that we've been in where we've had victory and held the enemy back
[40:45.960 --> 40:50.240]  for so long that's why they're forced to reveal themselves now as you said
[40:50.240 --> 40:56.640]  earlier show their cards in a desperate brazen braggant power grab that if we
[40:56.640 --> 41:01.200]  actually stand up against maybe their downfall and give us a reprieve of a
[41:01.200 --> 41:07.200]  decade or 100 years just as Ninevo was given a reprieve as in the old so as in
[41:07.200 --> 41:11.920]  the new this is what we're looking at I just don't want to decide that we're
[41:11.920 --> 41:15.400]  going to submit to this obviously we're not but I don't want us at a gut
[41:15.400 --> 41:19.680]  spiritual level to feel like we're on a fool's errand and are just doing this
[41:19.680 --> 41:24.240]  because justice be done may the heavens fall that's not what we're doing yes at
[41:24.240 --> 41:28.240]  one level we are but greater than that is that we will have victory if we
[41:28.240 --> 41:32.560]  simply demand it and take it that's God's promise but we have to stand up
[41:32.560 --> 41:37.320]  against the enemy when they come in David I mean I'm ranting here but this is
[41:37.320 --> 41:41.920]  just over the top to actually see all of this unfold the power grabbing of one
[41:41.920 --> 41:46.360]  month dwarfs what I've seen the last ten years David what are we going to see on
[41:46.360 --> 41:50.200]  the next month David I don't know Alex but you know what you said is exactly
[41:50.200 --> 41:53.880]  right people have to stand up that's what's right about these people going
[41:53.880 --> 41:57.480]  to Banner's office and saying you said you were going to do this you didn't do
[41:57.480 --> 42:00.600]  it and of course the larger picture is they've taken it and those to the
[42:00.600 --> 42:04.920]  comp the Constitution and they're walking that back what you're saying for
[42:04.920 --> 42:09.160]  people to stand up and peacefully demand their rights is what we saw at the
[42:09.160 --> 42:13.760]  Bundy Ranch that was very encouraging I saw the Second Amendment exercised in
[42:13.760 --> 42:18.680]  the way that the founders meant for it to be exercised and that is as a deterrence
[42:18.680 --> 42:23.000]  to criminal actions by the government the government had come in there they
[42:23.000 --> 42:27.840]  had confiscated his cattle but more importantly they had attacked people they
[42:27.840 --> 42:31.560]  had set up signs that said this was the First Amendment area the people in that
[42:31.560 --> 42:36.440]  area were sick of the abuse they put on their weapons and they stood them down
[42:36.440 --> 42:40.680]  no violence happened but they did it peacefully structure it since shock waves
[42:40.680 --> 42:44.480]  the power structure yes when you guys stood up to them and they had to back
[42:44.480 --> 42:47.720]  down and let them know that we're not going to be bullied forever and at a
[42:47.720 --> 42:51.120]  certain point we're not going to back down do they really want the next
[42:51.120 --> 42:55.200]  licensure concord do the globalist who are barely hanging on right now really
[42:55.200 --> 42:59.000]  want this civil war because when they blow stuff up to demonizes it ain't
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.520]  going to work this time the police and military know what's going on now you
[43:03.520 --> 43:07.800]  ain't gonna work the dog ain't gonna hunt David I don't think that the Senate
[43:07.800 --> 43:11.720]  has our back on this like anything else Alex this letter from the 52 senators
[43:11.720 --> 43:16.240]  they talk about what the ATF calls as framework quote an ATF framework for
[43:16.240 --> 43:20.280]  determining whether certain projectiles are primarily intended for sporting
[43:20.280 --> 43:25.040]  purposes that's what the ATF is putting out there and they're saying that we're
[43:25.040 --> 43:28.560]  going to determine the ATF is going to determine whether or not the ammunition
[43:28.560 --> 43:32.880]  is intended primarily for sporting purposes and the Senate is saying you
[43:32.880 --> 43:35.480]  don't have the right to make that determination but what they're not
[43:35.480 --> 43:39.480]  talking about Alex is the elephant in the room the fact that the Second
[43:39.480 --> 43:43.440]  Amendment is not about sporting it's not about hunting it's not about target
[43:43.440 --> 43:48.160]  shooting it's about a check on the power of government and that check can be done
[43:48.160 --> 43:52.760]  peacefully just as we saw during the Cold War we had a stand down a mutual
[43:52.760 --> 43:56.160]  assured destruction and that can be done peacefully that's why we have the
[43:56.160 --> 43:59.200]  Second Amendment it's not for hunting and absolutely the collectives are
[43:59.200 --> 44:01.920]  trying to gut the country right now because they're losing they know the
[44:01.920 --> 44:05.960]  country is waking up they're scared ladies and gentlemen but they want to
[44:05.960 --> 44:10.360]  try to bully us now into submission it cannot happen in fact later at the
[44:10.360 --> 44:14.360]  bottom of the next hour we ought to air the audio in the video of that epic
[44:14.360 --> 44:19.600]  footage it's got like a million views I think the name of the video is a fed
[44:19.600 --> 44:23.120]  surrender to citizens what's the name of that video David that you and Josh shot
[44:23.120 --> 44:27.720]  live on the ground there I'm I'm sure it was something about the Bundy Ranch
[44:27.720 --> 44:33.480]  standoff it's got about 1.3 million views on it by now I think it's fed
[44:33.480 --> 44:38.000]  surrender to citizens Bundy Ranch might be put that on screen for folks we should
[44:38.000 --> 44:41.760]  have articles about that and explain this is the blueprint not so much with an
[44:41.760 --> 44:45.520]  armed standoff but the fact that when they did pull the guns and say we're
[44:45.520 --> 44:48.640]  gonna shoot you that's when the people wrote across and said go ahead and do
[44:48.640 --> 44:53.080]  it there it is historic feds forces surrender to the American citizens that
[44:53.080 --> 44:58.280]  sent shockwaves through the globalist Harry Reid and others shook with fear and
[44:58.280 --> 45:02.720]  said this cannot be allowed to stand there will be repercussions what you
[45:02.720 --> 45:06.560]  gonna start a bigger war don't you people get it that we're not afraid we
[45:06.560 --> 45:09.640]  just have tried to fix things peacefully and we don't want to have a needless
[45:09.640 --> 45:12.640]  civil war with the police and the military as their rights have been
[45:12.640 --> 45:16.200]  destroyed to and their citizens as well don't you understand world governments
[45:16.200 --> 45:20.920]  real America really has been captured you're living in an epic time folks like
[45:20.920 --> 45:25.480]  a movie like where the French resistance this isn't a game people we are
[45:25.480 --> 45:30.520]  occupied the globalist have seized control it's real there really is baby
[45:30.520 --> 45:35.960]  flavoring used with dead babies for Pepsi there really are dead babies in the
[45:35.960 --> 45:41.560]  vaccines you understand I mean it's all over the top people they really do eat
[45:41.560 --> 45:47.120]  hospitals in Oregon and in London all over the world with dead babies we I mean
[45:47.120 --> 45:51.120]  the globalist are evil do you understand it isn't a game we were right it's all
[45:51.120 --> 45:55.480]  happening and we're not happy about being right damn it excuse me I apologize
[45:55.480 --> 46:00.880]  but this is not a game people it's not a game do you understand they're coming
[46:00.880 --> 46:04.320]  they're killing us they put it in the fact things people are dying everywhere
[46:04.320 --> 46:10.000]  they're murdering us with soft-kill weapons I mean it's just unbelievable we
[46:10.000 --> 46:13.000]  probably go to some phone calls David fact let's just go ahead and go to some
[46:13.000 --> 46:18.200]  phone calls let's go to let's go to Greg into Mexico or Craig into Mexico go
[46:18.200 --> 46:23.240]  ahead you're on the air hello first-time caller been listening guys for years and
[46:23.240 --> 46:27.840]  years and I couldn't agree with you more what I'm looking at is on the second
[46:27.840 --> 46:32.440]  amendment then going after the ammunition is what they're most likely
[46:32.440 --> 46:37.280]  going to do and this is from what I'm noticing is a false flag and then they're
[46:37.280 --> 46:42.280]  going to go with John Kerry signed the United Nations Small Arms Treaty and
[46:42.280 --> 46:46.840]  what they will do is what it looks like if they will say since we're on the
[46:46.840 --> 46:51.520]  Small Arms Treaty we want to ban any imported ammunition coming into the
[46:51.520 --> 46:56.120]  country and if you think about it what that'll immediately do is all you have
[46:56.120 --> 47:01.320]  ever with AK-47s AK-74s anything that that comes from out of the country which
[47:01.320 --> 47:05.440]  is a good majority of the ammunition that's produced immediately takes that
[47:05.440 --> 47:10.200]  out of the public and then they can have on the gun owners and let's go back
[47:10.200 --> 47:13.880]  but and then next they'll ban having it you're absolutely right and the dominoes
[47:13.880 --> 47:17.520]  will fall quickly remember what's the war on guns been the whole time it's been
[47:17.520 --> 47:22.440]  the war on ammo with the feds buying every caliber known in existence
[47:22.440 --> 47:27.400]  basically by the billions to create a massive increase in prices they've done
[47:27.400 --> 47:32.360]  everything they can like it's a military operation to degrade our capacity to
[47:32.360 --> 47:36.440]  uphold the Second Amendment go ahead caller exactly Alex and now when you
[47:36.440 --> 47:41.480]  look at them going after the ammunition again you now watch price skyrocketing
[47:41.480 --> 47:45.080]  for the ammunition now you're seeing shells being picked clean again and
[47:45.080 --> 47:48.560]  every time you start seeing where there's a surplus of ammunition there's
[47:48.560 --> 47:52.940]  something that goes on and they try to take it away and think about all the
[47:52.940 --> 47:56.200]  people that have those those rifles as soon as if they have the stockpiled
[47:56.200 --> 48:01.360]  ammunition as soon as that happens they no longer have access to any ammunition
[48:01.360 --> 48:05.440]  exactly and I'm also been a big person for the Second Amendment I'm also a
[48:05.440 --> 48:11.200]  veteran I'm an oath keeper and I also thought about this a year ago when they
[48:11.200 --> 48:17.440]  went after the 5.45 by 3 9 round immediately you saw the prices jump on
[48:17.440 --> 48:20.920]  those you saw rounds just nobody nobody could get him any longer you couldn't
[48:20.920 --> 48:25.360]  buy him online now when the surplus is then there's no longer surplus it's now
[48:25.360 --> 48:30.120]  it has to be modern manufactured for them to be able to use it and that's why
[48:30.120 --> 48:34.600]  everything just about curtailing the Second Amendment and understand folks we
[48:34.600 --> 48:39.160]  have literal foreign enemies in control of trying to disarm the people the
[48:39.160 --> 48:43.400]  Republican leadership is scared to death bullied into submission and if you
[48:43.400 --> 48:46.320]  wanted to bring America down they're shutting our energy off opening our
[48:46.320 --> 48:50.520]  borders driving down wages putting regulations raising taxes executive tax
[48:50.520 --> 48:54.920]  raising Obama has now announced it's on if you wanted to really bring the
[48:54.920 --> 48:58.240]  country down which the globalists want to do at some point you would cause a
[48:58.240 --> 49:02.640]  civil war which will effectively bring the entire country down and will kill
[49:02.640 --> 49:07.680]  millions and I just keep hammering that because the plan is civil war painting
[49:07.680 --> 49:11.080]  conservatives and libertarians and veterans as the enemy with the
[49:11.080 --> 49:15.720]  government and its giant Third World hordes dumb down believing the
[49:15.720 --> 49:19.200]  government loves them as the new constabulary I mean can you imagine a
[49:19.200 --> 49:24.320]  more hellish thing this is their plan I ask you this is not rhetoric I mean what
[49:24.320 --> 49:29.680]  I'm saying it's real is this not just over the top bizarro land I mean are we
[49:29.680 --> 49:35.120]  really going to let this happen is the FBI and the CIA and the joint chiefs and
[49:35.120 --> 49:38.880]  everybody else you're really gonna do this you I mean you're really gonna kill
[49:38.880 --> 49:42.560]  the country you're really that nuts you really go along with the globalist that
[49:42.560 --> 49:46.760]  hate freedom and hate liberty and hate free market and hate fathers so much
[49:46.760 --> 49:50.640]  that you want to break this country completely in multiple pieces because I'm
[49:50.640 --> 49:53.920]  gonna tell you something there is no way you're ever gonna get away with this
[49:53.920 --> 49:57.520]  from your own masters you understand your own masters once they've taken over
[49:57.520 --> 50:00.640]  you've studied history you know that the number one rule is burn every one of you
[50:00.640 --> 50:04.560]  traders they're not gonna leave you top we're going to break in one minute call
[50:04.560 --> 50:08.720]  or any other points okay can I can I make one more comment before I let some
[50:08.720 --> 50:13.200]  go there I came up with it with something to circumvent what they're
[50:13.200 --> 50:16.480]  doing if you look at the ammunition that's coming from outside the country
[50:16.480 --> 50:20.200]  it's all Burden primer I know if you're familiar with Burden primers it's all
[50:20.200 --> 50:25.840]  steel-taste ammunition you can't get brass to reload for those cartridges it's
[50:25.840 --> 50:30.440]  nearly impossible to find especially in a crisis situation so even if people
[50:30.440 --> 50:34.720]  wanted to reload those those cartridges they couldn't do it I actually came up
[50:34.720 --> 50:38.840]  and I actually came up and I patented a system but now you can reload your steel
[50:38.840 --> 50:45.560]  cartridges and I have a little plug Russian reloads.com and I sell a kit
[50:45.560 --> 50:50.160]  that you can convert your steel cartridges to reload very exciting a lot of
[50:50.160 --> 50:54.040]  time we're gonna get David Knight's take on this on the other side the big
[50:54.040 --> 50:59.720]  issue is they're coming for the guns period set the precedent harvest right

[54:05.560 --> 54:09.280]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and Alex is joining us from
[54:09.280 --> 54:13.240]  the road we've just been talking about the crisis for the Second Amendment and
[54:13.240 --> 54:17.800]  it is a crisis they're trying to take the ammunition and they're doing it by
[54:17.800 --> 54:21.880]  writing their own rules at the executive level at the bureaucratic level what are
[54:21.880 --> 54:25.040]  we going to do about it we just had a caller call in and talk about how you
[54:25.040 --> 54:28.760]  could no longer find brass that's one of the first things the Obama
[54:28.760 --> 54:33.160]  administration did back in 2009 they said they were not going to let the
[54:33.160 --> 54:37.080]  military recycle brass back into the commercial market they were gonna have
[54:37.080 --> 54:41.600]  them crush it sell it to the Chinese as scrap metal they had a letter from
[54:41.600 --> 54:44.560]  senators said don't do that they they said we're gonna change the policy and
[54:44.560 --> 54:49.240]  sell it but Alex we found years later that at least one place I believe it
[54:49.240 --> 54:53.240]  was Fort Drum in New York in their recycling plan they were still crushing
[54:53.240 --> 54:57.920]  and selling brass instead of putting it back into the market they want to take
[54:57.920 --> 55:02.480]  ammunition away from us we have nothing but clubs if they do that in fact in
[55:02.480 --> 55:06.680]  early 2014 about a year ago I guess it was in February last year so over a year
[55:06.680 --> 55:12.320]  ago the last lead smelting plant in the United States closed so we cannot even
[55:12.320 --> 55:16.680]  smell lead for bullets we have to buy it from China and then Obama can put in
[55:16.680 --> 55:21.720]  bargos as he's announcing on that executively this is true treason now we
[55:21.720 --> 55:26.640]  start the next hour Indico kid Antoine Doug Dylan Chris we're gonna go to your
[55:26.640 --> 55:30.680]  calls bam bam bam so have your point or your comment ready on the Second
[55:30.680 --> 55:35.520]  Amendment and this crisis please don't forget the fact that we're listeners
[55:35.520 --> 55:38.880]  supported we have high-quality nutraceuticals the highest quality
[55:38.880 --> 55:42.800]  like ancient defense herbal immunity booster you get a free bottle of that
[55:42.800 --> 55:47.320]  when you purchase two bottles of survival shield nascent iodine x2 that is
[55:47.320 --> 55:51.920]  our flagship unprecedented form of iodine that no one else has truly amazing
[55:51.920 --> 55:56.200]  from our deep earth crystal source it's some amazing things for myself it's the
[55:56.200 --> 56:00.760]  good halogen blocks out those bad halogens in the thyroid and more now
[56:00.760 --> 56:05.240]  we've got products that are 1495 like a bottle of ancient defense leading
[56:05.240 --> 56:09.080]  competitors with similar formulas I'll just tell you quite frankly to the big
[56:09.080 --> 56:12.960]  giant factory that makes it for us does a great job one of the biggest in the
[56:12.960 --> 56:17.280]  world organic puts out a similar one and sold in Whole Foods for double that but
[56:17.280 --> 56:21.960]  the point is 1495 is very affordable so we have high quality stuff super
[56:21.960 --> 56:27.760]  affordable we have things like DNA force where one ingredient the bio PQQ is
[56:27.760 --> 56:32.640]  $12,000 a kilo well we just purchased more to make a new run it'll take about
[56:32.640 --> 56:38.000]  six weeks we're gonna sell out very soon of DNA force and it's gonna cost more
[56:38.000 --> 56:42.800]  than $12,000 a kilo okay and it's got a bunch of those and you know CoQ 10 the
[56:42.800 --> 56:47.080]  true organic types I mean you can buy synthetic stuff for really cheap this
[56:47.080 --> 56:54.160]  product is normally $154 we lowered it to $134 until it sells out at this rate
[56:54.160 --> 56:57.240]  it should sell out by next week I just that's what I do when something's already
[56:57.240 --> 57:00.720]  selling out I just sell for cheaper just an obnoxious free market thing I do to
[57:00.720 --> 57:06.840]  give folks the best deal ever 94 47 so we have the Lamborghini Countach or the
[57:06.840 --> 57:13.320]  Ferrari quality DNA force leading competitors $300 to $600 these have
[57:13.320 --> 57:17.640]  patented proven ingredients where you can actually make claims on them you can
[57:17.640 --> 57:22.040]  go see the videos at m4slife.com and you know read all the specific stuff
[57:22.040 --> 57:25.760]  written up by the lawyers as much as we can say but most supplements can't do
[57:25.760 --> 57:29.360]  things like that because they're not nutraceuticals I mean this I take this
[57:29.360 --> 57:33.440]  every day everybody says I look younger everybody says I'm more aggressive I
[57:33.440 --> 57:38.560]  just the stuff it does to the various working areas of your cells is what the
[57:38.560 --> 57:42.680]  oxy powder does to your intestines it just blows it out and I take two tablets

[57:54.680 --> 57:58.720]  I'm just telling you you've heard the listeners this isn't a game look into
[57:58.720 --> 58:02.920]  what bio PQQ does look at what CoQ 10 does and all these other ingredients in
[58:02.920 --> 58:08.720]  here you want supercharged you know longevity quality it's DNA force it is

[58:27.040 --> 58:31.880]  after marketing and after staff everybody we make about $20 on it when

[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:26.920]  Jones show I'm David Knight in the studio we have Alex Jones with us on the
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:30.920]  road and we're talking about the second amendment now the government has been
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.800]  coming after ammunition from the beginning of the Obama administration
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.200]  they're banning components they're not recite they're like lead they're not
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:44.080]  recycling the brass into the marketplace they've passed the UN ATT to try to they
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:50.520]  not passed it they've had the Secretary of State sign it yeah absolutely they're
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:53.920]  going to try to use that Alex to stop ammunition from coming across the borders
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.560]  as well because right now because the shortages and the panic in the American
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:02.560]  market people are importing a lot of ammunition from abroad and that's why
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:08.000]  they did the false flag fast and furious to try to support the UN ATT I mean we
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.520]  are in the hands of criminals David let me ask you this question do you think
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.360]  they're doubling and tripling down because they know the country's waking up
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:17.720]  I mean that's what I see happening but I don't want to be delusional what what do
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:21.360]  you really think in your spirit I think that's true I think there's also a
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:26.440]  time frame I've talked about it several times the the fourth turning that some
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:32.840]  sociologist Strauss and how have noted a a cycle in the history of man of
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:36.080]  government there seems to be a generational cycle everything they've
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:40.800]  been talking about is pointing to the 2020-2025 time frame that they're
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:44.720]  working on so I think that's one aspect of it I think people are also waking up
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:47.320]  there's a lot of evidence of people waking up look at what's going on with
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:52.640]  McDonald's they've had nine straight months of declining sales and of course
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:58.000]  they're pulling them on Santo a growth hormone to make your daughter seven
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.240]  feet tall they're growing young cancers on record they're pulling a bunch of
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:07.240]  other GMO and a bunch of other toxic things from their food I mean these
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:10.680]  announcements are daily David like you said because we still have some free
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:14.680]  market we still have some internet we're crushing them and that's why they
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:18.640]  want to come in and with Google and start censoring health sites and
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:22.120]  alternative news and the stories we put out because the truth is getting out
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:26.800]  there they're not stopping the signal we're taking phone calls throughout this
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.160]  hour I'm gonna shut up now get to one call before we go to break and come back
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:35.360]  and take others Indico kid on the executive gun grab happening right now
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:39.240]  will we get stirred up like an ant hill and do something or will we lie back and
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:43.040]  just let them take the guns because if they set the precedent here 52 senators
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:48.400]  have said they're gonna go for all the ammo of course they are well so what I
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:52.200]  think will happen in America is that if we don't start having open carry
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:56.440]  marches then we'll have stories like a break in at four in the morning or some
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:00.200]  kid gets flashbang there's baby or whatever so eventually it will leave the
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:03.760]  open carry marches but it's kind of a question of whether or not it will be
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:08.960]  like the one year ranch or 1776 you know like Lexington and Concord and I think
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:14.160]  that uh they'll definitely blow up federal buildings and like my dream that
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.800]  I once had though there's like holding facilities or that have like illegals
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:21.880]  that are women and children only they'll blow those up to start like get a race
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:27.040]  war started and stuff but ultimately I think that uh it's the house cards of
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:30.640]  bureaucracy that's really what will change then is when you know you work
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.840]  for the ATF and then the DEA breaks into your house at four in the morning and
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:37.880]  shoots your kid stuff like that I mean that's when you know like if you work
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:42.400]  the CIA the NSA is spying on you CIA is spying on you so eventually people are
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:46.440]  gonna have to kind of shrug and just do what's common sense and I've never
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:50.720]  really promoted anarchy or anything but I think we're moving toward anarchy and
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:55.040]  the system is trying to game that and the only way it could even possibly work
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:00.440]  is if people follow karmic principles if there's spirituality involved if we're
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:05.160]  informed citizenry then we can maybe be capable of self-rule that's right when
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:09.080]  you say really deep point you're making right now I'm gonna hold you over to
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:12.720]  finish your point the next segment and get David's take on this as well before
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:16.520]  we go to other callers so don't hang up indigo kid well you know about karmic
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:21.280]  rules you know I'm not a Zen Buddhist but Christianity teaches you reap what
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:25.480]  you sow in fact what you do will come back on you I inherently feel that and
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:29.040]  everything I do it's called being God fearing these idiots that are building
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:33.960]  this tyranny think a tyranny is gonna make them safe it is the pit in which

[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:21.480]  hi folks we are back live David Knight is in the studio in Austin Texas at the
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:26.600]  info wars news center there are a lot of key headlines at info wars.com we
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:30.120]  haven't even gotten to yet we won't do that till later in the hour because I
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:33.800]  want to race through some of your phone calls right now as we look at the over
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:38.840]  the top incredible power grab from the FCC grabbing the internet to Obama putting
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:42.200]  our military under UN command shutting off our power plants opening the
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:46.480]  borders completely giving the illegal social security cards free tuition free
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:51.680]  health care free everything. Obamacare wrecking things doubling tripling prices
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:55.640]  now ammo bands with the Democrats saying we're gonna go after basically all the
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:09:01.840]  ammo 42 senators warned that they will go after all the ammo I mean it is just
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:07.040]  epic what's going on other headlines live before sex you're a rapist. New
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:11.160]  Snowden documents CIA documents showed how ten years ago they had meetings
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:15.800]  how to put back doors into all the new smartphones UN says conservatism a
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:19.840]  threat to women's rights down plays Islam and you're chopping women's
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:23.320]  genitals off and torturing them selling them into rape slave gangs that's
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:29.160]  trendy and liberal because it's a foreign culture but if you like NASCAR and
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:34.480]  wear pants and your wife didn't tell you to step and fetch it you actually just
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:39.120]  get along with your wife you're a bad person that's right Obama signs executive
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:43.480]  order declaring Venezuela a national security threat Venezuela is to
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:47.760]  biometrically fingerprint you when you go to the grocery store now and it's a
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:52.880]  tyranny in Venezuela it's a great evil oh look at the communist dictatorship oh
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:59.560]  my gosh but when I complained about it at the DMV or the scanners going in on
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:03.400]  the Microsoft system it's like oh big deal Alex well wait till they track
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:09.240]  everything you do and tax everything you do that's where all of this is going
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:13.840]  again if you just joined us what are we going to do to defend the second
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:18.400]  amendment well first we have to get the true talking points out this 223 green
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:22.160]  tip ammo ban is meant to be expanded into basically every other caliber out
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:26.600]  there they want to get handguns you can hide they want to get semi-auto rifles
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:30.760]  they if they can get the bushmaster if they can get the 223 they can get the
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:36.000]  m4 variant they can get them all so we've got that but it's all part of a
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.360]  larger power grab where they won't block Obama on grabbing the borders and
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:44.960]  leaving them wide open they won't go after Obama on going after the guns they
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:49.480]  won't go after him on anything because the Republican leadership of the big
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:58.280]  issue here is what do we do to shut this down what do we do to get the message
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:01.680]  out that the globalist have dropped the hammer it's kind of like you're on a
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:07.960]  roller coaster up to the top we've now gotten to the top and then we're getting
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:10.640]  ready to roll down the hill in fact I've already started to go down the hill
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:16.120]  folks where we're that deep into this analogy now I was hoping we were at the
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:20.320]  top of the hill we're now rock starting to go down the roller coaster ladies and
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:24.400]  gentlemen and we had just better get the country out of the coma yes it's
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:28.240]  somewhat awake but not all the way David get your take on what I just said
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:31.320]  some of the other news stories you want to hit we're gonna go to indigo kid Doug
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:36.920]  Antoine Dylan and Chris in short order you know Alex it is very concerning to
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:41.080]  see that the government of course is practicing these door-to-door raids you
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:44.640]  know saying that they're there to help you not just to come in and rest your
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:48.200]  and confiscate the guns but you know they don't have to confiscate the guns if
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:52.080]  they shut down the supply of ammunition and it makes it very easy for them to
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:55.000]  confiscate the guns if they do that we've always heard the thing that the
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:00.080]  citizens power comes out of boxes we've got the jury box the election box we've
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:03.960]  got the cartridge box it wasn't the gun it was the cartridge box you've got to
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:07.800]  have the ammunition that's why the Obama administration has been after the
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:11.560]  ammunition from the get-go and of course how do we support all those we
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:16.400]  support those with the soap box the first amendment waking people up to what
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:21.520]  the danger is sorry and it's under attack as well absolutely absolutely and
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:25.120]  you know people don't even know what their rights are as jurors so we have
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:28.120]  to educate them as to what their rights are as jurors and we have to educate
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:33.480]  them as to what their rights are as citizens being able to own weapons the
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:38.120]  right to keep and bear arms when the senators the 52 senators who sent this
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:42.480]  protest letter to the AFDF saying that you know you have set up without any
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:47.720]  support you purport to create an objective test never before applied for
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:51.080]  delineating which projectiles are primarily intended to be used for
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:56.200]  sporting purposes well fine yes they have done this they have just gone out on
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:00.080]  their own they purport to set up an objective standard but the Senate still
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:05.400]  doesn't get it it's not even about using this stuff for sporting purposes they
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:09.520]  won't address that issue and that's the core thing Alex well that's right and
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:12.560]  they're setting the precedent again if they could ban one type of ammo the most
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:16.040]  popular they could ban it all now let's pull back before we go this call you just
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:20.760]  hit something key there if you want to shut down cars and people traveling you
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:25.680]  make gas more expensive and the Bilderberg group in public memos and
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:29.720]  then also from our sources is always obsessing on we want to shut down the
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:34.360]  economy so that there can't be protesters here they understand that
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:38.640]  having some money being middle-class gives you autonomy gives you a position
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:44.560]  to negotiate with the powers that be from a position of strength why in
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:48.160]  ancient war would you have a siege around the city for a year to then make
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:51.280]  them give up because if you're starving to death you don't have any
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:55.240]  negotiation power and that's why they want us dependent under clowered and
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:57.640]  pivot and that's why they don't want you to know how to skin a buck or run a
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:03.680]  truck line and it's going to be ill-billy true redneck culture for blacks
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:07.040]  Hispanics whites I don't care you go to Mexico the folks they're independent
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:10.480]  down there more redneck than he read neck I ever saw in Texas they don't want
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:14.960]  wild men they don't want hill people they don't want folks like that with the
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:19.880]  solar power with technology that know how to run machine shops and know how to
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:23.800]  reload ammo and know how to skin a buck run a trot line and who run their own
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:29.640]  government and who have farmers markets and that's why they're going after the
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:33.880]  ammo buying it up driving up prices banning importation restricting the
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:38.840]  brass not letting the military sell it back in a civilian reloading almost all
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:43.560]  308 223 I used to buy or or 9 millimeter when I was younger and that was the
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:49.360]  military around was reloaded US military very inexpensive high quality they are
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:53.880]  trying to make it a lead us to have guns and ammo so that it isn't a popular
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:58.200]  thing in the culture they the globalist this is so key that we're going to your
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:00.920]  calls I want everyone to listen up and listen up good because when I'm
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:05.080]  cogitating when I'm calm driving on a road trip and really think about how to
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:10.240]  beat the enemy I know how to beat them it's common sense of history culture
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:16.240]  beats culture velvet revolution beats their system we have a culture that's
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:22.240]  powerful that's sexy that's God-given that says prowess that is common sense
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:28.160]  that is empowering and a gun culture with men and women together hunting
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:33.120]  and shooting and and and defending and and killing criminals when they come in
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:37.600]  your house and standing up and taking our streets back and the prosperity that
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:44.480]  comes with it is so empowering they want to drive up prices simply so that the
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:48.840]  general public can't exercise in it and can't be part of it because so many
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:53.200]  liberals are getting deprogrammed and are getting the gun bug and are I mean
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.080]  you go down to Austin the mega city most popular for LA trendies and others in
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:00.760]  New York trendies to flee their collapsing lovelace compounds you go and
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:06.400]  it's liberals buying guns it's liberals wearing blue jeans and cut-off shirts and
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:11.120]  driving Ford pickup trucks it's liberals going and literally bringing back
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:16.320]  country dancing two-stepping and basically modern square dancing and all
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:20.960]  the new hot clubs in Austin you go to these things there's like 500 people
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:26.040]  women men dancing black white old young doesn't matter and they're
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:31.560]  absolutely adopting Americana hillbilly culture the globalist are panicking
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:35.680]  right now trying to teach five-year-olds how to engage in oral sex trying to
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:39.400]  inject trainees into the bathroom to freak everybody out and cause a fake
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:43.680]  debate while we're all being robbed and meanwhile the liberals are finding X
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:48.320]  caliber they're finding that a free man has a gun they're finding what it's all
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:54.320]  about the women want it and so that manly culture John Wayne and 707 horsepower
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:59.240]  cars is coming back and it threatens the new world order and it's culture that
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:05.240]  we've got 1776 that trumps them we got the ace of spades we've got a fist
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:10.040]  full of aces if we just play them let's go back to that one caller then we go to
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:13.520]  break I promise look at everybody in the go kid you've got the floor here to
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:19.680]  take us out to break thanks Alex um well my wife coach have a exercise here
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:23.320]  you can do in the left hand column you're right entitlement that's the title of
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:27.720]  the left-hand column and in the right-hand column you title it gratitude so under
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:31.040]  entitlement you write self-esteem and diametrically opposed to that under
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:34.440]  gratitude itself compassion those are really different ideas people should
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:39.080]  research also under entitlement you have the structure of narcissism which the
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:42.280]  opposite of healthy narcissism which is kind of a dumb term but you can look up
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:46.440]  on Wikipedia basically Western innovation has been pushed by healthy
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:51.120]  narcissism and under entitlement you also have relative truth which
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:54.640]  diametrically opposed absolute truth as you know Alex the relative truth
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:59.840]  movement basically says I'm trendy therefore if Muslims want to rape kids
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:03.040]  radical Muslims that that's their business where absolute truth says
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:07.440]  that's absolutely not the case and finally a fatalism diametrically
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:11.000]  opposes parmic principles those are just terms that people can look up but it's
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.200]  all the same thing entitlement that's left-hand magic and today a Christian
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:19.840]  sense gratitude right hand magic there's thousands of ways to look at it really
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:24.800]  well I mean listen when I get into the trendies getting into wearing checkered
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:29.640]  shirts and blue jeans and cowboy boots and buying guns that scares the system
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:34.960]  because if guns become trendy which they have all the top shows on TV were gun
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:38.160]  shows you notice they all kind of got removed the last year all these shooting
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:42.560]  shows got canceled you know they had top ratings because we're winning David
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:46.240]  Knight I mean do you agree with that statement I agree I think we're winning
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:49.360]  the information war but I also agree with what you're saying that the attack is
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:54.720]  not just on removing our ammunition it's on making us poor so that we can't
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:59.000]  resist what they're doing and that kind of stratification Alex we had a story
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:04.320]  on info wars.com earlier today 95% of new homes are being built for the rich and
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:09.440]  for the poor middle-class homes so it's these two extremes eliminating the
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:13.440]  middle-class which is what the people who want to control you the people who
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:16.600]  are authoritarians the people who are socialists they hate the middle class
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:19.760]  the bourgeoisie as they call it and they're eliminating that and you can
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:23.560]  see that right now in the people that can afford to have homes of course the
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:26.680]  poor homes are being bought for them they want everybody to be poor and
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:31.960]  dependent on this small elite ruling class. Absolutely criminal it's called
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:36.360]  slavery it's called domestication it's called bondage the middle class is the
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:40.800]  latter for the poor people to innovate it's the Renaissance engine everyone
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:44.520]  knows it but notice all the snot nose criticisms and media of the nuclear
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:49.000]  family and how three meals a day is racist no cutting off avocas food is
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.440]  racist we're gonna expose it all we're going right to your calls straight ahead
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:59.520]  on the other side of the break it's the fight for the Second Amendment why use

[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:37.440]  not but so what do we do do we abandon ship it's a global government there's
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:40.920]  nowhere to run do we have a civil war with these people they're gonna blow
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:44.760]  stuff up and frame us I mean we're gonna probably have one whether we want one or

[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:51.760]  from Austin Texas with us I'll be back tomorrow co-hosting the whole three
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:56.440]  hours and then I'm taking off Thursday and back in studio Friday again David
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:59.040]  night doing a great job wanted to take my kids down the Texas coast for a few
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:03.080]  days they could do some deep sea fishing and so I'm enjoying the rainy Texas
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:06.960]  coast right now but still on the job because wild horses couldn't drag me
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:12.560]  away Antoine in California thanks for holding you're on the air yeah this is
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:17.560]  Antoine can you hear me Alex yes sir welcome Alex okay yeah so I wanted to
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:24.800]  talk about how the dictatorship in the in the censorship it all it is is
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:31.040]  because I think that we are like you say a mass awakening is about to happen so I
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:36.120]  think it'll really hit the paid earth once this election starts and he's the
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:41.760]  base starter I think that they're really really afraid of these debates I think
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:45.320]  once these debates start they're gonna start talking and you're gonna start
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:50.640]  hearing all these bad the bad news and conspiracies about Clinton and the
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:54.440]  Republicans is all gonna hit the dirt is gonna hit the mainstream because it's
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:58.760]  gonna be a talking point so I think they might nuke us they might buy a weapon
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:02.120]  they might weather weapon they come they might start a war with Russia
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:08.560]  whatever it is this is one of the worst like debated debated about the
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:13.520]  presidents of debates for presidents I've ever seen like this should be David
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:19.560]  that David Knight pointed out that its interagency fighting is a bad thing but
[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:22.960]  it's also a good thing separation of powers even though they've gotten rid of
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:26.240]  separation of powers with the legislative executive judicial there's
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:31.920]  still a natural infighting within the agencies themselves that was the genius
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:35.080]  of what the founders set up that they're too busy fighting with each other to
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:39.360]  ever get their act together to take over but they're still kind of doing it
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:43.640]  that's a really great point thank you so much Antoine yeah this election is
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:46.520]  coming up and they usually don't like dirt to come out but some of the dirt
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:50.440]  will come out as different agencies and different candidates flame each other
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:54.600]  David Knight I don't know I hope so Alex I mean we've seen all these revelations
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:59.760]  about what the NSA is doing people got very angry about it have we seen them
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:06.040]  camping out on people's offices have we seen any changes being proposed no
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:08.960]  people are getting used to it they're accepting it they're saying yeah of
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:12.000]  course they're watching us you know just yesterday Apple came out with a new
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.760]  wristwatch it's going to be an accessory to your iPhone and that's what it's

[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:36.560]  a database all the TVs are watching you you're in a free country but Alex Jones
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:40.280]  is a cook and don't listen to them full wars.com absolutely David you know we
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:44.760]  there's another article that was up on a dredge report today about new memories
[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:48.880]  being implanted in mice while they sleep and it starts out sleeping minds
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:52.040]  prepared to be hacked this is an experiment Alex they did in Paris
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:57.360]  France and of course we've seen the DARPA funding this same type of
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:01.520]  research saying that they want to remove bad memories from people we want to help
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:06.400]  the troops with PTSD that's not the way it's going to be used it's going to be
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:10.600]  used against political opponents against enemies of the state absolutely
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:14.480]  right let's jam in another call here thank you Antoine let's go ahead and
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:19.880]  talk to Dylan in Texas you're on the air go ahead hey guys good afternoon God
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:23.000]  bless you and thank you for everything you're doing real quickly one of two
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.480]  things I think what we're gonna have to do is is there's gonna have to be
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:30.720]  basically a constitutional take back of our rights at the White House meaning
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:35.200]  there's gonna have to be you know some quite number of gathering of people and
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:39.440]  we're gonna have to basically throw these people out of office as a collective
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:43.800]  and agree upon the people that we want to in place immediately if we're actually
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:48.080]  serious about doing anything and actually want to get anything done second
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:53.200]  point the economic class I know you I notice you use a frog in the boiling pot
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:57.080]  example and that's exactly right that's what we're seeing right now in the
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:01.600]  stock market for a week straight now everything's been going down but we've
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:07.480]  been seeing real heavy moves to everything stocks in the Europe and
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:11.400]  other corporations are now starting to shift and move away from us so it's
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:16.480]  pretty much exactly how you explain that well remember the globalists pretty
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:19.600]  much are far and pretty much European and they've got they've been in an
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:22.960]  alliance with China and they're totally selling us out they'll probably break
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:26.040]  that alliance later but they're basically all ganged up on Russia right now
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:29.560]  and that doesn't mean that Russia are angel cakes it just means they're not
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:33.560]  offensive they're being ganged up on because they're seen as the weakest but
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:36.720]  the Russians always get seen as the weakest by Hitler Napoleon you name it
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:41.160]  and they find out that's not the case the Russians only seem to get up and get
[01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:44.360]  fighting once their corner we'll be back with more calls thank you caller great
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:53.360]  points Dylan we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:20.160]  the road is Alex Jones and we're talking about the Second Amendment Alex how do we
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:26.320]  pull this back how do we pull back this bureaucratic executive order to take our
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:30.600]  ammunition well the only time I've ever had success in my life is when I get
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:35.160]  angry and get focused and actually state what's going on versus the rhetoric
[01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:40.440]  they put out you know the the the FCC claims they're protecting the internet
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:45.080]  well they have no business regulating it yes the Patriot Act is not patriotic
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:48.880]  unless you're patriotic to tyranny all these Orwellian names and when I was
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:53.600]  20 years old they were trying to pass laws in the State House here in Texas and
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:57.440]  people asked how you defeated I'm gonna kind of tell it in a story a parable
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:02.440]  true story but an allegory and I went down to the State House I went and got
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:07.360]  involved in the different Second Amendment organizations because they
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:11.040]  were going to ban people under 18 being able to shoot guns with their parents
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:15.200]  the different shooting clubs the YMCA you name it they were going to ban gun
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:20.080]  shows I understood that that was a move to take our guns not a move to protect
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:23.080]  the children not that I was a rocket scientist I just knew that was
[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:27.680]  fundamental by getting politically involved at one level I then became
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:32.200]  somewhat seasoned and learned about how other things worked and I'd also studied
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:36.160]  a lot of history so I wasn't doomed to repeat it I understood the classical
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:40.320]  forms of manipulation deception and oppression when I was witnessing it we
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:47.400]  have a politically and geopolitically and culturally illiterate population on
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:51.520]  average now the globalists have done that so that they are dealing with
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:56.560]  basically a population that's ignorant that goes without saying but that
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:02.480]  actually is a downfall for the system because we can wake up their peoples
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:06.960]  that they've been controlling very easily with crash courses in history and
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:11.640]  common sense because ingrained in them are still the instincts to recognize
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:16.040]  what's happening and there are a lot more of us that are awake and understand
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:20.080]  what's going on out of the sea of dumb down people then there are globalist
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:27.240]  controllers so we really have the leg up the initiative on so many fronts you
[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:30.600]  ask how do we defeat it I want to get your take on it I want to get listeners
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:33.720]  take on it and I want to ask listeners we're about to go right back to in a
[01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:39.720]  moment what they think the next shoe is to drop but David I think we label this
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:46.320]  what it is not hey come on the cops say this is hardly used in crime and hardly
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:51.760]  ever suits a cop and you know why are you doing that and and no you're you're
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:56.880]  setting the precedent to ban almost all ammo you've said you want to go after
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:00.520]  the Second Amendment you've done it you promised you wouldn't you've been caught
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:07.640]  staging a false flag you are criminals that want a totalitarian takeover while
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:12.760]  you arm against us you and us disarm it's very simple you are criminals and
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:17.200]  once you just raise the rhetoric to that level they that's what defeats them
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:20.920]  they're always don't have rhetoric don't be aggressive don't say radical things
[01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:25.640]  well when they're radically power grabbing we have to state what they're
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:29.040]  doing and yes it's gonna sound radical because we're just a mirror of what
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:32.200]  they're doing for every action there's an opposite equal reaction Newtonian
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:36.800]  physics so a we got to get mad we got to get stirred up we've got to get
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:43.000]  aggressive and we've got to take liberal trendy brainwash heads out to shoot
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:48.400]  guns religiously all of us have to pick one of these victims one of these one
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:55.200]  of these conditioned jellyfish slaves of the state and not column names like I
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:59.480]  just did I know it's hard but lovingly understand these are brainwash creatures
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:03.560]  who didn't have fathers that taught them how to skin a buck or run a trot line
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:06.840]  these are people that don't get independence these are people that
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:10.480]  don't get having a gun in your house not because you live in fear but because
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:14.960]  you live in strength we have to get people into guns get people into self
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:18.960]  defense we have to promote the family we have to explain that the enemy is trying
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:23.160]  to bring us down we have to come together and not just attack the feminist at
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:26.080]  the low level because they're just victims as well explain to them how it's a
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:29.840]  disempowerment social engineering program show them the different documents
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:34.040]  and proof and people are ready people understand that the trendiness that the
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:39.480]  system hasn't delivered they're ready to come out of Egypt they're ready we have
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:44.240]  to go as you said and have sit-ins at Boehner and other traders offices until
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:48.480]  they begin impeachment hearings of Obama for this outrageous gun grab and the
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:53.280]  borders being wide open we have to understand that we've sat back and been
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:57.520]  lazy for so long thinking that oh America will just go on forever there's so
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:02.080]  much prosperity but that's not the case now we have the bobbles the trinkets the
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:07.160]  signants of wealth but the spirit of of freedom that helped generate all this
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:12.520]  wealth is dying right now at so many levels it's also being rekindled at so
[01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:16.920]  many levels so it's a minute by minute second by second battle that we're
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:20.400]  involved in we've got to have sit-ins at their home offices of the Congress
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:24.120]  people we've got to get aggressive we've got to go out and protest the ATF
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:28.360]  offices we've got to go I've done that before we've got to have rallies of
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:33.280]  capitals we've got to call the media we've got to get aggressive and we've
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:39.480]  got to also say look we're not backing down we're not turning our guns in if
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:44.200]  you want them come and take them and then we have to know if the enemy the
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:47.680]  minute they bomb a federal building we've got to drive there whoever's
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:51.360]  closest in videotape the globalists are so obvious they'll probably be walking
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:55.480]  around putting bomb casings in the back of their ATF vehicles like last time
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:59.240]  I mean the ATF was just loading the bombs with the FBI and staying in the
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:02.560]  hotels in front of everybody and people say what are you doing at Oklahoma
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:05.640]  City and they'd say oh we're doing telephone work putting big gray sticks
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:10.160]  of butter in the walls I mean why aren't a building takes weeks and you know
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:13.920]  there's all these quote handsome guys you know I've had the witnesses on Jane
[01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:18.160]  Graham and others and I guess they are kind of handsome hardcore killers you
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:21.480]  know German intelligence was there you name it loading up the building with
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:26.360]  bombs next time you see that start videotaping we are the humid you know
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:29.760]  just because we don't wear black suits and have sunglasses and talking to our
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:35.320]  sleeves we are the real intelligence agency of 1776 okay we got to have our
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:40.400]  cameras have our phones heads up and be tracking enemy operations everywhere we
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:44.640]  see something we say something just like Kurt Haskell exposed the government
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:48.720]  did the underwear bombing he was later confirmed to be accurate our listener
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:52.680]  knew what to look for and he was there and he blew their operation wide open
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:56.840]  and that's what scares the enemy our people are everywhere that's why they
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:01.000]  want to start shutting down internet freedom before they bring in the real
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.800]  tyranny well guess what you're not going to stop the signal our people are
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:09.240]  everywhere including in the police agencies and the military and that's
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:12.240]  what scares them I'm going right back to calls but David Knight I want to get a
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:15.360]  two-minute response from you on that rant I think you're absolutely right
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:18.720]  Alex I think we need to have a grassroots empowerment they understand
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:23.400]  that it's very empowering for people to have weapons to protect themselves but
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:26.520]  the way we typically see it is in Hollywood where they portray it as
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:31.320]  criminally dangerous and so people need this to experience that as you point out
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:34.600]  but I think that as far as a legal framework I don't think we're gonna get
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:37.880]  anything from our people in the federal government I think it's gonna have to
[01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:41.480]  come at the state level with state nullification it's gonna have to come
[01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:45.760]  with jury nullification people refusing to convict their fellow citizens for
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:49.720]  things that are not legitimate laws because they violate the Constitution and
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:54.880]  people standing up and asserting their freedom as in the states just as they
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:59.840]  have with the legalization of marijuana they have stood directly against the
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:03.400]  federal government's mandates as far as marijuana and that is standing because
[01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:06.960]  they first won the hearts and minds and the understanding of the people on
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:11.760]  marijuana and they understand that it can be used medically and they understand
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:14.480]  that's being abused and so they're they're shutting down the federal
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:19.600]  government we need to understand that just like the war on drugs the ammunition
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:24.520]  war is coming from the United Nations they enact these agendas the US signs
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:30.200]  on the treaty and then ten years later we had the war on drugs began exactly
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:33.400]  that we do timelines for people on the nightly news because I know we all know
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:36.240]  this our listeners know it but it's always about the new viewer who is who
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:39.320]  we're really targeting the new listener try to free their minds we're in a war
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:44.800]  for hearts and minds here people and I just got chills this is so epic we need
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:49.840]  to explain to people they signed that UN treaty December 24th and all hell broke
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:54.480]  loose even though Congress and senators was a 30-something senators sent a
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:58.360]  letter to Obama threatening him with impeachment hearings if he signed that
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:03.960]  treaty well he did it we never hold him accountable because so much of Congress
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:08.520]  has paid off or they're blackmailed and they're scared they're scared I mean
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:13.320]  they put Susie is in prison right now folks for making a movie basically I
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:17.080]  mean I mean these people do not play games people like yeah Alex they may get
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:23.040]  you well they may but I mean come on we're fighting for the homeland we're
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:28.880]  here this is the Republic this is real this is 21st century warfare folks this
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:32.960]  is your chance to defend the Republic against the takeover and I know there's
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:38.080]  ESPN and you know other stuff to do but this is real we're being usurped and
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:43.000]  when they usurp the public they want the 320 million Americans they want you as
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.280]  their slaves you understand that this is a criminal energy all right I'm gonna
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:52.960]  race through calls now let's go to who's up next here let's talk to Chris in
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:57.320]  Minnesota you're on the air thanks for holding

[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:10.560]  let Chris in Minnesota go we'll shift gears now and we'll go to Michael in
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:17.920]  Wyoming Michael in Wyoming you're on the air yes hi Alex hi and my colors are
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:24.400]  welcome can the network feed me hi our audio just for the callers go ahead yes
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:29.960]  Alex can you hear me yes I can okay look people need to understand the game
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:34.960]  we're playing here back in 1933 and I'll refer you to representative Jim
[01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:38.840]  Trafficking's comments for the Congressional record that he made back
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:45.920]  in 1993 regarding the bankruptcy of this country back in 33 and we've been
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:52.120]  operated as a dictatorship essentially under martial law ever since then the
[01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:57.120]  Constitution's Act of 1933 when Roosevelt took over yeah and they've
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:02.320]  they've they've continued to to create phony emergencies year after year to
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:08.120]  keep that it going on in perpetuity so you know if it appears that they're
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:11.920]  trashing the Constitution as I was listening to Dave yesterday and you
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:16.840]  today folks there is no Constitution as as Bush said it's a gd piece of paper
[01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:22.840]  and in their minds it's history they're going into collecting the mode as in the
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:30.080]  IRS to collect what they consider to be a bankrupt nation and basically they see
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:37.120]  you as slaves of the corporatized government so and the only law that
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:42.440]  really is in effect now is commercial law since every one of these agencies
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:49.680]  from the EPA down to your local county sheriff and your local courts are all
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:57.720]  corporations listed on Dunn and Brad Street and what you just said and of
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:01.480]  course Michael's been calling for 15 years or so he's a medical doctor really
[01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:06.040]  smart guy involved the Republican Party and stuff let me try to break down and
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:10.360]  expand on what you're saying it's true that they declared the war powers act
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:14.440]  and brought us under that in 1933 that proclamation is public it's why they
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:17.920]  declare an emergency every year in Congress to supersede the Constitution
[01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:21.200]  that's how they tell the congressman you can do this because of the emergency
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:27.440]  but there's still force of will and force of law and force de jure so they
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:33.160]  started building with 1913 in the 1933 the full takeover this illegal beach
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:38.440]  yet but it is a fraudulent contract so we can declare it fraudulent there was
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:42.000]  still the old republic the old Constitution the old rights were still
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:46.640]  in operation by practice and possession is nine-tenths of the law and so our
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:51.920]  refusal to turn in guns our refusal to register wells our refusal to register
[01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:55.960]  when we have farmers markets our refusal at the grassroots to not comply which is
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:59.680]  now about survival not complying with tyranny is obedience to God to
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:04.240]  paraphrase George Washington and so there was a parallel republic still there
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:08.480]  for now 80 years they've been really a hundred with the Federal Reserve they've
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:13.360]  been dismantling the old republic now they're busy cutting down the last pieces
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:19.320]  so now we're going to see a real dictatorship of foreign banks pressing
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:23.080]  in against us so Michael give me your take on that that I want David Knights
[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:28.160]  response yeah you're absolutely right you you can still obtain your sovereign
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:32.320]  status and I know that's it's a little hackneyed at this point but it's it's
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:37.480]  true even even in this corporatized world that we live in let me recommend two
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:42.640]  books they're real short and they've got there just back with information they're
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:47.520]  both put out by the National Liberty Alliance.org one is that called the
[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:52.840]  UCC connection subtitle how to free yourself from legal tyranny and the
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:58.680]  other one's called meet your straw man and whatever whatever you want to know
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:04.080]  subtitle both these will tell you how to communicate that basically it's through
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:10.640]  affidavit is is how you re-assert yourself absolutely tell the system who
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:18.720]  you are and it's all real but so many people do it without properly studying
[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:22.400]  or don't do it right there's so much bad advice and the system tends to try to
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:28.360]  ignore it but if you do it right pro se litigants are having better effect some
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:31.280]  of my folks I know are having better effect against the feds with it van
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:36.160]  through with lawyers and when you get top lawyers you actually get people that
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:40.600]  actually do this themselves I mean I've seen lawyers stick letters under the
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:44.840]  courthouse door and refuse to even go in the courtroom and and do things that I
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:49.480]  heard from the you know Patriots 20 years ago so it's absolutely real and
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:53.800]  everything's being phased into admiralty law under administrative law and I've
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:57.480]  seen in UN documents court rulings where they're taking people's land and stuff
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:03.720]  actually declare admiralty and war powers under 1933 so it's just so
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:08.360]  incredible how many judges and people know all this and it is a criminal
[01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:12.160]  conspiracy unbelievable thank you so much Michael David Knight your take on
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:16.240]  what he just said yeah Alex I understand and I think it's very important for the
[01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:21.520]  public to understand that the people in government at all levels take an oath to
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:25.880]  the Constitution and so I think we talk about the Constitution because people
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:29.520]  need to understand the public needs to understand this disconnect these people
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:34.120]  who come in they are not elected king they are merely stewards under the
[01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:37.120]  Constitution that's what they're publicly telling everybody that we're
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:40.320]  going to be we're under the Constitution we're taking an oath to it
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:44.360]  that's how they assert their just authority and many of them believe that
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:48.120]  they are doing that we point out where they're wrong about that just like with
[01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:51.000]  the Lord of the Rings the analogy that the king has been replaced by this
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.920]  steward who now wants to keep himself and his progeny permanently and entrenched
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:58.760]  as the king that's what the return of the king was about throwing this guy out
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:03.040]  who is the unfaithful steward who usurp the authority people can understand
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:07.240]  what the caller was just talking about but first they need to understand that
[01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:10.280]  this is an illegitimate government saying they derive their power from the
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:14.360]  Constitution we are going to restore the Constitution just as the king was
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:18.120]  restored and Lord of the Rings we're going to put the rifle king back that's
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:22.000]  right and expand that's we the people under God not under the state not under
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:26.200]  a permanent dictatorship because you know it says Romans 13 well even if you
[01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:30.000]  take the fake extrapolation the modern churches do like Hitler did and say
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.120]  submit to government well our government is for oven by the people so when you
[01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:37.320]  violate the Constitution the Bill of Rights and Declaration of Independence
[01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:41.360]  you're violating God's commandments now I don't agree with that twisted
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:45.800]  extrapolation that you know that they use with Romans 13 but but taking their
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:49.440]  argument they're defeated right there but if you then extrapolate out from that
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:54.040]  point they did create a parallel system for themselves to operate in the
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:50:00.040]  parallel system of law going back to basically Roman ship law Roman commerce
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:05.440]  law is is is the globalist duplicate that the British were following that
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:11.200]  they've kind of segued us on to it's actually even older than our law but
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:15.120]  it's only for people that aren't slaves who are part of the establishment but
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:19.680]  there's a there's a public document out there a Constitution that lays out how
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:23.320]  we would like to see the government run they swear that they have allegiance to
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:26.520]  it that's where they say they get their their power from it so we need to hold
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:30.360]  that up and we need to say this is how the Constitution works
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:35.080]  yeah let's come back and flesh that what I'm saying is I understand I'm saying
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:39.680]  they parallel fraud right okay oh absolutely but say they get their
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:42.840]  authority from the Constitution so yes they are under that even though they
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:45.640]  want to try to jump back and forth and play games stay with us ladies and

[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:18.160]  here back live coming to you from the road David Knight is co-hosting with me
[01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:23.640]  doing a great job there in Austin Texas at the info wars dot com news center
[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:29.520]  coming up top geo peers as it's time to dissolve the ATF but take the agency and
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:35.480]  basically put it under the DEA careful what you wish for also us since
[01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:41.200]  heavily armored groups to Baltic states deter Russia that's AFP this is
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:45.560]  escalating very very quickly we'll get into the latest with the Iran deal and a
[01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:51.920]  bunch of other news that I haven't even gotten to yet and then about 40 after the
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:55.640]  debut of Rex Jones I mean you've seen a few of the reports he's done without
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:59.320]  releasing his name over the years or without showing his face but I tell you
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:03.680]  I was not involved in this production Rex pretty much directed it with his
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:07.600]  cousin my first cousin Buckley Hammond who has been working in the offices for
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:10.920]  20 years actually buckley's been working with us since before I ever started in
[01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:14.040]  full wars he helped me launch it and he was gone for 12 years and just came back
[01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:19.320]  but Rex pretty much wrote and directed this it comes off it's a really good
[01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:23.160]  report comes off pretty mainstreamy though and very newsy it shows both
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:27.880]  sides of it I wanted to just see what my 12 year old son would do and I'd give
[01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:31.800]  him an A plus he's a little more timid in the video than he is in person but
[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:36.200]  he's only 12 I'd be more nervous than he was when I was 12 I mean he really did
[01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:42.680]  this with the camera guys and Buckley but but I'd say 90% of the what you're
[01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:47.760]  gonna see was was Rex's own words I'm pretty proud of him that's coming up at
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:51.440]  40 after it's much better than the other kid productions to see out there I'm
[01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:54.680]  giving him to make stuff for children and young adults and if he creates a good
[01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:59.160]  core group doing that I may then start branching out and talking to other
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:02.680]  Patriot parents and folks out there who've been through kind of the JBS school
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:07.040]  Rex's never been to the JBS camps never even read their publications but he's
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:11.200]  read he reads adult PhD level history books just it's what he's into more than
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:16.680]  ever I was he's gonna be a much better version much better latest adaptation of
[01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:20.360]  the info warrior and I'm very very proud of him I'm not pushing him to do it he
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:24.000]  has a lot of passion for it so that's coming up in the next hour and we're
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:31.200]  gonna go to Mark in Oregon and Jason and Robert and Gerald and Rob and others
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:36.960]  here bam bam bam quick comments briefly we are lizard supported we're going to
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:39.960]  sell out of the ancient defense because we're giving a free bottle of that high
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:44.000]  quality product when you purchase two bottles of the X2 nasin iodine and
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  stock up on that and we are also selling out of that very very quickly probably a
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:54.040]  few days left of that infowarslife.com your purchase does fund the
[01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:58.160]  operation in our defensive the unborn the defense of the Second Amendment it's
[01:56:58.160 --> 01:57:02.240]  very important to support us and I know you are so God bless you and DNA force
[01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:05.800]  we have low end stuff that's super high quality like ancient defense that's
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:09.800]  1495 because the ingredients aren't very expensive so we can give you a really
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:14.040]  good price on high quality organic stuff that's known to boost immunity but then
[01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:18.120]  we've got the super high end where it was 150 something bucks leading
[01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:21.880]  competitors are 300 to 600 dollars for something similar so this is a Rolls
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:28.120]  Royce or Ferrari product at a Ford Explorer price still high quality well
[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:33.440]  we slash prices down first it was 150 something then to 130 something it was
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:36.320]  getting close to selling out it's very popular product one of our best sellers
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:40.400]  helps fund the operation my dad had an idea with dr. group to put out something
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:44.920]  that was just Rolls Royce level we did it's been very popular it's now 90 what
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:51.760]  is it today 90 because I came up this last week 94 47 30% off the already
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:55.760]  discounted price to try out the bottle of DNA force and see what it does for you
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:58:00.680]  and the small profit we make there's one ingredient here's like 50 bucks one
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:04.040]  ingredient we added this like 50 bucks a bottle just give you an idea I mean this
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:07.720]  is just just the people that manufacturers for it so one of the most
[01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:11.400]  fancy you know best places in the country said they've never seen anybody do
[01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:16.360]  something like this they just said it is over people go to clinics basically

[02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:57.240]  you know empowering the human spirit the globals are all about suppressing it
[02:00:57.240 --> 02:01:02.000]  I'm not negative when I bring up all this bad news I want to fix it let's go to
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:05.240]  your phone calls right now mark in Oregon thanks for holding you're on the
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:11.440]  here hi Alex hi David actually Alex you'd mentioned a handful of aces that
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:16.880]  we've got I really just see one ace in our hand and that is the people there's
[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:21.880]  a lot of construction that's already been completed as far as informing those
[02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:25.840]  who will listen over the years you've pretty much been at the head of that
[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:30.760]  alex I would say that we only have one ace it's an ace of spades that can't
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:36.320]  fail and that is simply that we take it out into the public while we've been
[02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:40.920]  talking you've been talking to us others have other broadcasters we've been
[02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:44.680]  talking to others they've been walking and they're making a whole lot of
[02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:48.880]  progress and it's time for the talking to stop as far as the private quarters go
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:54.120]  of the broadcast ways need to get out there in public need to get out and have
[02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:59.680]  what I call seminar days and combine it with a recall petition effort which was
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:04.840]  certainly I should be recalled he should be removed a speaker but but if
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:08.240]  but if they're too cowardly to do it we need to start recalling him in his
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:14.000]  home state absolutely needs to do with Bloomberg Bloomberg spent hundreds of
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:17.240]  millions of dollars just the last few years hundreds of millions getting
[02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:21.320]  matching funds from Bill Gates and others and Warren Buffett on record to go
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:24.480]  and try to unseat good sheriffs and good members of legislatures and members
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:29.720]  of Congress where is the NRA they need to give 20 million dollars I mean they
[02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:33.280]  asked for it they get it right now from there from their five million members
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:36.440]  or whatever it is you know ask for five dollars from each one of them they'd
[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:40.400]  have the money they need to go give 20 million dollars for a recall a banner and
[02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:45.800]  remove him remove that piece of trash that's a great point thanks for the call
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:49.320]  let's get David Knight's take on that absolutely Alex I think it needs to be
[02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:52.480]  shut down from the outside I think Washington is too corrupt one of the
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:56.920]  best ways to do it is to call him back from the state level we've seen that
[02:02:56.920 --> 02:03:01.560]  happen when they've passed regulations out west we see the gun control
[02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:07.160]  regulations we had legislators that were recalled out in what was it Colorado I
[02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:13.880]  believe it was Governor Davis I mean he was nothing compared to Banner and
[02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:18.120]  the Republicans now I mean hardcore commies are nothing compared to people
[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:21.880]  oh absolutely I still think what we need to do is we need to use state
[02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:25.640]  nullification we need to use jury nullification people need to understand
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:29.880]  the legal constitutional framework for that they say that they are swearing
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:34.160]  allegiance to the Constitution let's let them prove it let's exercise the rights
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:38.120]  that we publicly have under state nullification and jury nullification to
[02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:41.920]  shut this thing down and I see it happening I see it happening with the
[02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:46.000]  marijuana legislation that we see popping up in different states and there's
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:52.200]  been proposals at state level that they should be able to allow they should be
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:56.400]  able to manufacture firearms as well as ammunition within a state and that the
[02:03:56.400 --> 02:03:59.240]  federal government would not have any authority over that if it didn't cross
[02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:02.680]  the state lines that is how the Constitution was set up we should assert
[02:04:02.680 --> 02:04:05.000]  that authority we should make our own ammunition if they're gonna ban the
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:10.200]  ammunition make ammunition inside Texas for Texans well that's the way to do it
[02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:15.280]  is innovation is what will defeat these people making art making culture they
[02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:19.440]  have a dead culture the globalist are a corporate board if we simply promote our
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:23.960]  culture side by side with theirs people will vote for our culture just like the
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:28.480]  organics the true hippie true liberal movement the good parts of it understand
[02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:32.840]  states rights they've used it to get a trump card on organics to get a trump
[02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:38.200]  card on marijuana and it has a dark side folks but it's not a federal issue and
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:43.240]  it's the people's right to do that so now the left can't argue against us on

[02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:17.200]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight in Austin and joining us on
[02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:21.920]  the road is Alex Jones and you know Alex we talked about this article is up on
[02:08:21.920 --> 02:08:26.120]  drudge about them and planting memories and demise successfully I think it's a
[02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:30.320]  great analogy for what's going on in the info war one of the things that they
[02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:34.640]  point out they said they've been able to do subconscious association while
[02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:38.280]  animals were sleeping in the past this is the first time they've been able to
[02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:43.160]  plant a conscious memory into people but think about how easy it is for them to
[02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:48.240]  do it to humans when we're asleep when we're just passively accepting what they
[02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:51.560]  feed us and the news and the media and the television and the movies that we
[02:08:51.560 --> 02:08:56.520]  watch they can build all kinds of passive associations and it's very easy for them
[02:08:56.520 --> 02:09:00.200]  and that's a lot of guardians sorry and the stories of the London Guardian today
[02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:03.280]  from the process has joined us and then you've got the Attorney General saying
[02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:07.080]  let's brainwash the public against guns and we wonder why there's subliminals
[02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:13.440]  against Alex Jones info wars drudge I mean we've shown people where we catch
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:19.880]  them with half-second long stuff that says Ron Paul is a drug is a method you
[02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:23.480]  know I'm breaking bad or Alex Jones is a coup that thinks you know they're
[02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:28.720]  building you know Elvis or or Michael Jackson is at the space station this is
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:33.760]  what they're doing and folks that's 101 subliminal programming this is a all-out
[02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:39.320]  war and the war has put people into a trance they found in major studies that
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:44.120]  the average person watches about five hours of TV above the age of 40 or so
[02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:48.480]  people can pull these articles up speaking of that it's in the Guardian but
[02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:52.320]  people below that are watching up to 10 hours a day of some form of media or
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:57.280]  screen time this is this is literally brain-damaging the public screwing up
[02:09:57.280 --> 02:10:00.640]  kids hundreds of pediatrics organizations and studies have come out
[02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:06.640]  saying don't give your kids an iPad or iPod or droid period period ladies and
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:12.760]  gentlemen and then of course before he died they asked Steve Jobs hey do you
[02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:17.960]  give your kids iPads he said absolutely not never so they know what they're
[02:10:17.960 --> 02:10:23.560]  doing and then Google Alzheimer's TV viewing and it's they've known for 30
[02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:28.760]  years neurological disorders are linked to watching TV they can flash
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:36.200]  strobe lights in fact it's well known at raves that will put people into a
[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:42.480]  trance without being on drugs that's how widespread this technology is and I
[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:45.560]  was just talking to a lady the other day who went to a rock concert never had
[02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:49.160]  epilepsy and they flash the lights a certain way and a bunch of people not
[02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:53.560]  just her basically fell out having convulsions well it's well known you can
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:58.000]  put a computer program if you have the right light bank to make a certain
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:01.760]  number of percentage people go into convulsions or into a mesmerized state
[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:05.960]  where you can then program them if it's coming out of a television set with a
[02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:10.920]  carrier wave or messages directly to the subconscious that cannot be blocked so we
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:15.560]  have these hypnotic triggers and this isn't me folks this is taught at the
[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:19.000]  University of Texas psychology department 15 years ago I was allowed in
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:22.440]  there and stuff and saw some secret DARPA stuff or let's just say restricted
[02:11:22.440 --> 02:11:27.120]  but that part wasn't even secret this is what's taught 101 this is what's going
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:31.400]  on 101 this is the scientific takeover where everything is about dominating
[02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:37.200]  engaging and controlling humanity and it's just being rolled out now to
[02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:42.760]  control everyone remember must have been 20 something years ago thousands of
[02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:46.680]  children in Japan thousands in the US went into convulsions and when
[02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:51.440]  Pokemon when the eyes flashed that's because they know the carrier wave
[02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:56.160]  they're doing these as mass test ladies and gentlemen we're not in Kansas
[02:11:56.160 --> 02:12:01.400]  anymore and we know they're putting in vaccines with the troops I'd cover this
[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:05.280]  10 years ago covered six years ago and videos like brain eating vaccines people
[02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:08.640]  didn't believe me even when it was in the literature now it's like oh we're
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:12.520]  giving the troops shots that don't make them be upset anymore oh then a lot of
[02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:15.800]  them commit suicide later they say it's like they're not alive anymore but
[02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:22.880]  they're not in pain anymore either the vaccines go in and eat the receptors in
[02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:26.840]  the area your brain associated with spiritual consciousness higher brain
[02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:31.720]  waves we are living in a science fiction movie but we're not on the black hole
[02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:37.760]  spaceship with Maximilian shell and the robots weren't good enough for him so
[02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:43.880]  he digitally with electricity lobotomized us with electro shock the
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:48.880]  crew to be his slaves they're already way past you know Disney movies like the
[02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:52.440]  black hole folks they don't need to do that they can give you a shot you'll
[02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:57.040]  still go to work you'll do what you're told you'll still be partially there but
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:13:03.560]  the spiritual connection is severed at least partially I mean it's already
[02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:09.240]  going on it's already happening and that's why I freak out this is a normal
[02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:14.680]  response to someone who's not been put under a trance I mean people 100 years
[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:18.160]  ago would act 10 times crazier than me if somebody tried to do something to their
[02:13:18.160 --> 02:13:22.040]  kids if Jocelyn elders got up 20 years ago and said working on our cakes for
[02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:25.920]  little kids how to reach down and touch themselves and masturbate it's a good
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:30.680]  thing people would have flipped why are we so comfortable because with chemicals
[02:13:30.680 --> 02:13:36.280]  and drugs and flashing lights and subliminals and culture and our own
[02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:40.480]  laziness they have put us into a trance break the trance I'm telling you
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:45.720]  folks prayer has shown to take you even if you're an atheist to a higher level
[02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:49.480]  of consciousness I'm telling you if even if you're an atheist if you just pray
[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:53.480]  to Jesus Christ to break your conditioning to unlock your mind in
[02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:57.280]  your soul and just invite Christ to him because it's a free will universe and
[02:13:57.280 --> 02:14:03.080]  say Christ if you're real come into my life free my mind of this conditioning
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:05.560]  even if you don't believe that Christ is real but that you're going to a higher
[02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:08.360]  level of your mind I don't believe that's what's happening at one level
[02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:12.200]  that's there but then God connects to that if you just ask Christ to come into
[02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:16.960]  your heart come into your soul and show you the truth and empower you and open
[02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:22.560]  your mind I'm telling you if you say that with free will God will will give
[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:26.080]  you a choice but when the Holy Spirit folks comes to you and start showing you
[02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:30.040]  this stuff if you say okay God I know you're real and I don't want you that is
[02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:36.200]  the ultimate sin to reject the spirit of Christ ladies and gentlemen and I'm
[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:40.720]  just telling you it's real if you want discernment if you want real power Christ
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:44.760]  is ready to give it to you but you will then be under Christ control doesn't mean
[02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:48.000]  my flesh is an evil doesn't mean I don't do bad things but in my heart in my
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:52.800]  soul and my my conscience when I when I'm when I'm not doing the right thing it's
[02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:56.440]  literally there and you cannot then reject that spirit so I'm telling you
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:15:00.160]  if spirits are real folks if you will simply and people say oh this is a bunch
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:05.080]  of mumbo jumbo do it prepare yourselves to break free of Satan prepare
[02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:08.760]  yourselves ladies and gentlemen to be able to see and come out of the matrix
[02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:14.160]  ask Jesus Christ into your heart and pray that our leaders like Saul of Tarsus
[02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:19.000]  be struck with reality I know there's some men in the system and women that
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:23.400]  aren't pure evil that could be turned to good pray that God move on them as well
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:28.280]  pray that God's spirit move on the land David night I didn't mean to go off end
[02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:30.600]  of that but these are desperate times I'm just telling folks that where I
[02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:34.520]  really stand David night here's take on that we're gonna go back to calls yeah
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:37.840]  Alex you're absolutely right it's ultimately a spiritual battle these
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:41.520]  things perpetuate over multiple generations we know that it's
[02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:45.680]  accelerating right now my wife read to me a very interesting testimony from the
[02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:50.160]  actor Denzel Washington I would encourage people to take a look at what he
[02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:59.360]  said in terms of his encounters with God but I'm very very concerned about what
[02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:03.480]  is going on in terms of you're talking about chemical lobotomies that they're
[02:16:03.480 --> 02:16:07.240]  able to do of course they did massive surgical lobotomies on veterans when they
[02:16:07.240 --> 02:16:11.560]  came back from World War two there was a long series of abuse about that in the
[02:16:11.560 --> 02:16:15.160]  Wall Street Journal but now they're moving beyond that to doing electronic
[02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:19.560]  lobotomies and the things that they're able to do people can't even understand
[02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:24.000]  that's how asleep the public is and that's what is so dangerous about this is
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:27.520]  that when we're in kind of a semi-conscious not even paying attention
[02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:31.320]  not really truly even physically sleeping but just not paying attention it's
[02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:35.800]  very easy for them to do these things to us subconsciously as well as consciously
[02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:39.560]  when we look at these experiments that they're doing with the mouse brains when
[02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:43.360]  we look at the brain initiative that Obama has put in we talked about that
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:47.880]  we talked about artificial intelligence yeah it's very dangerous excellent
[02:16:47.880 --> 02:16:50.480]  points David I don't mean to go off in a jag when you brought that up but it's so
[02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:54.400]  incredibly important in fact they just pulled up the Denzel Washington clip if
[02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:58.520]  we get the audio of that maybe we can play that later as well right now let's
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:02.560]  go back to the calls who's been holding the longest here Jason in Tennessee God
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:08.200]  bless you for holding you're on the air thank you thanks guys I'll be short
[02:17:08.200 --> 02:17:12.960]  Alex I really do believe that in the very end of this for up we will have to
[02:17:12.960 --> 02:17:18.840]  take up arms but in the meantime what we have to do and and a group in my
[02:17:18.840 --> 02:17:24.600]  little town in Tennessee East Tennessee we have gone to alerting the public of
[02:17:24.600 --> 02:17:31.120]  all the school board meetings all the council meetings and we we regularly have
[02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:35.760]  the rooms are full when they have those meetings just to let these people know
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:42.800]  that we're watching you we we distribute flyers that tell what's going on in the
[02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:48.160]  town we've been we have actually had a corrupt mayor that was kicked out because
[02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:54.280]  of the alertness that the people have taken on to be awakened we have a lot
[02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:59.360]  of people that are still asleep and we have got to wake these people up we have
[02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:03.840]  to start with our young people we have to turn turn these young people over to
[02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:09.680]  the truth about things to get them away from this mesmerizing trance that
[02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:13.280]  they're in to get them away from that to show them what this country was like
[02:18:13.280 --> 02:18:19.360]  40 50 60 70 years ago with the way it was that it could be like that again and
[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:24.120]  even stronger Alex we can go and we can go to these meetings we can look these
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:28.480]  people and I we can stand there never even say a word but let them know that
[02:18:28.480 --> 02:18:34.440]  we are standing strong we are watching you and we will do what it takes for you
[02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:40.000]  to do what you you are supposed to do in this in this union thank you Alex God
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:44.960]  bless you sir thanks for holding to say that very strong testimony and give them
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:51.760]  literature talk to them we have to make a noise we have to act like chickens hop
[02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:54.320]  up and down when a weasel comes into the coop you can go out there and shoot the
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:57.120]  weasel well we're a lot better than chickens folks we can at least hop around
[02:18:57.120 --> 02:19:02.320]  and squawk I mean this is a big deal I mean they just got rid of the borders
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:06.440]  folks David take us out to break I mean it's what do you expect to happen next
[02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:11.880]  David the the executive tax increases well Alex you know Petraeus said that
[02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:15.800]  we we no longer have America we now have North America they're taking the mask off
[02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:20.360]  they're showing people that the the agreement that they passed 20 years ago
[02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:24.040]  NAFTA he even referred to NAFTA they're showing people that that wasn't simply a
[02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:28.040]  trade agreement it was something that directly affected our sovereignty and
[02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:30.760]  now they're showing us that and they're going to the next up they're showing us
[02:19:30.760 --> 02:19:34.480]  that because they're going to the next level with this trans-pacific transatlantic
[02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:37.160]  partnership and there's an article that we could talk about that's on New
[02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:40.760]  American where they said it's really kind of coming to a point now with that
[02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:45.720]  that's the real danger I think but we defeat this at the local level well we
[02:19:45.720 --> 02:19:48.560]  gotta just stop complying I mean they want to have these specific partnerships
[02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:51.840]  other things making decisions here they won't even let us see it I mean it's
[02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:55.640]  game over no it's not legitimate like King George wasn't legitimate

[02:24:15.600 --> 02:24:19.360]  the road and before we go back to Alex I want to get his take on this they're
[02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:22.680]  talking about the Apple Watch which came out yesterday one of the things they
[02:24:22.680 --> 02:24:26.880]  said about it was it's capable of displaying a barcode that will act as
[02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:32.560]  an airline boarding pass think about that image a barcode on your wrist to
[02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:36.800]  allow you to travel what does that conjure up does that sound like something
[02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:42.200]  out of a concentration camp what do you think Alex well David it's funny that
[02:24:42.200 --> 02:24:44.720]  you brought that up because when you were talking about all this beast
[02:24:44.720 --> 02:24:50.880]  technology last segment I was thinking about how they're going to make us have
[02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:55.880]  smartphones smart devices to travel and just live our lives it's there watching
[02:24:55.880 --> 02:25:00.360]  us it's our little guardian demon that will track our heart rate what we eat
[02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:05.200]  what we do how much we exercise to carbon tax us and track everything we do
[02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:10.560]  and this has all been announced just as other big TV manufacturers now go no
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:15.080]  we're recording and watching everything you do and all the smartphones London
[02:25:15.080 --> 02:25:18.440]  telegraph came out last week are in their terms of service watching and
[02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:23.440]  listening to you physically not just tracking the cookies and so see it makes
[02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:27.560]  everything we said pass a but we're still cooks because we said it first see
[02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:31.560]  it's like telling somebody were to strike gold and then you strike gold then
[02:25:31.560 --> 02:25:35.080]  you spit in their face well folks we're right about all the rest of it too
[02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:38.760]  believe me we give you all the documentation why do you think the
[02:25:38.760 --> 02:25:42.880]  military so awake they're training them for nationwide coordinating of cities
[02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:48.040]  and gun confiscation and their number one enemy is the gun owners the veterans
[02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:52.760]  they train to arrest veterans they train to kill veterans the military is
[02:25:52.760 --> 02:25:57.080]  freaking out but it's like someone who can see a thousand miles from a
[02:25:57.080 --> 02:26:02.360]  mountaintop talking to amoebas that don't even know they're in a petri dish
[02:26:02.360 --> 02:26:07.880]  when the military tries to warn people and so it's that disconnect the
[02:26:07.880 --> 02:26:12.680]  enforcers are being prepared for all out hell and they don't like it and they
[02:26:12.680 --> 02:26:16.120]  don't want to be part of it they don't want to back al-qaeda in Syria wars they
[02:26:16.120 --> 02:26:20.960]  don't want to be immoral and evil but the politicians run by foreign globalists
[02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:25.280]  are the problem and so we've got to identify the enemy we got to identify
[02:26:25.280 --> 02:26:29.560]  that America really is occupied America really is run by globalists we really
[02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:33.680]  are in a one-world government just like Italy has had their president appointed
[02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:38.160]  and Greece has had people appointed I mean think about how over the top that is
[02:26:38.160 --> 02:26:43.160]  that they've got all these secret Asia trade agreements and we get one part of
[02:26:43.160 --> 02:26:46.600]  the document from WikiLeaks and it's the total takeover of the internet and
[02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:52.280]  free speech it's Sopa and Syspa and it's secret we're under FCC regulation now
[02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:57.000]  the entire internet telecommunications and they won't release it because they're
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:01.720]  making a dictatorial move they've made the decision to go for a blog they're
[02:27:01.720 --> 02:27:05.640]  coming after the bullets they're coming after the guns and I'm just here
[02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:09.760]  screaming bloody murder on the parapets saying enemies are climbing the gates and
[02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:15.480]  then what do you do when they shut us down they're coming folks they're here
[02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:20.480]  it isn't a game and I'm not trying to get hyped up it's every time I think
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:24.960]  about how epic this is and how criminal this is and how ridiculous it is how
[02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:30.240]  over the top it is I mean I covered this Sunday mainstream US and British
[02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:36.720]  newspapers admitting that the vaccines were brain damaging people and admitting
[02:27:36.720 --> 02:27:40.120]  that glyphosates caused a five-fold increase in kidney failure you wonder
[02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:43.760]  why Dallas's places are popping up everywhere and I mean they're just
[02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:47.800]  murdering us they're murdering us they know they're murdering us it's a sick
[02:27:47.800 --> 02:27:52.160]  joke it's interesting Alex when you're talking about vaccines it was an
[02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:55.720]  interesting article guys pull this up about the former Morrisville child this
[02:27:55.720 --> 02:28:00.240]  is in North Carolina just outside Charlotte they're educating the public
[02:28:00.240 --> 02:28:05.160]  in this article about the vaccine court now this is a child that was damaged by
[02:28:05.160 --> 02:28:11.040]  vaccines she had encephalopathy brain injury they say she got $2 million plus
[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:16.800]  $250,000 a year for the rest of her life from the vaccine court Alex and the
[02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:21.160]  mother said I'm very angry because people want to put people like me who are
[02:28:21.160 --> 02:28:24.720]  concerned about vaccine safety now she's got a daughter that got $2 million
[02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:28.440]  and a quarter million dollar for life she's concerned about vaccine safety
[02:28:28.440 --> 02:28:32.880]  she says they want to put people like me in jail let's expand on that let's
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:36.880]  expand on that since they set the court up in the 70s it's been kept secret she's
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:40.400]  not even supposed to speak out when they put her daughter because the daughters
[02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:44.000]  admitted the truth you know they have a normally when they shoot your kid up and
[02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.680]  they have the convulsion never talk again and they get paralyzed they get put
[02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:50.280]  on a breathing machine they arrest you and claim you beat them up but now the
[02:28:50.280 --> 02:28:53.680]  science is there they know it's the vaccine and so she's supposed to sit
[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:57.760]  down take her to mail and then sit there with her vegetable daughter and
[02:28:57.760 --> 02:29:04.840]  absolutely now look me here's the article right here out of Fox News gun owners
[02:29:04.840 --> 02:29:09.640]  will not be allowed to adopt children heartbroken couple denied being able to
[02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:15.040]  adopt a child because they have a gun permit I mean ladies and gentlemen they
[02:29:15.040 --> 02:29:20.120]  are preparing to persecute and say if you've got guns you can't fly or if you
[02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:23.960]  don't take vaccines you can't have a job this is the tyranny you're supposed to
[02:29:23.960 --> 02:29:28.120]  let them brain damage your kids and carry out their black ops and they're
[02:29:28.120 --> 02:29:32.200]  shooting our troops up with soft kill but the good news is is the bad news
[02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:35.480]  they've hurt so many people there's so many victims that everybody knows the
[02:29:35.480 --> 02:29:41.360]  enemy and folks the enemy is scared and and as Coca-Cola and McDonald's falls so

[02:33:43.840 --> 02:33:48.800]  info wars.com and prisonplanet.com but I want to put on screen for TV viewers it
[02:33:48.800 --> 02:33:52.680]  came out in US papers and in British papers just last week we covered it
[02:33:52.680 --> 02:33:59.560]  where fluoride in new studies linked to obesity depression and failing thyroid
[02:33:59.560 --> 02:34:02.960]  there's the headline fluoride drinking water triggering depression weight gain
[02:34:02.960 --> 02:34:06.480]  warren scientist okay I mean there are literally when I say literally I mean
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:12.400]  literally thousands of obnoxious studies since 1900 or so a UT study from the
[02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:16.240]  30s found all this I mean it's ridiculous what hydrofluorosalic acid does
[02:34:16.240 --> 02:34:21.080]  turbocharged fluoride it's it's been souped up and had electrons added to it
[02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:25.880]  basically it just fries you and it adjuvants all the other toxins I mean
[02:34:25.880 --> 02:34:30.080]  it just mega kills your thyroid makes it makes you fatter than a pig you have no
[02:34:30.080 --> 02:34:35.040]  energy the X2-nation iodine is the good halogen it did exactly what Dr.
[02:34:35.040 --> 02:34:38.920]  group said it would do for me it's incredible info wars life.com and that's
[02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:43.280]  special been taken down I'm adding it back till it sells out two bottles of
[02:34:43.280 --> 02:34:47.480]  X2 get a free bottle of ancient defense DNA 4 is normally 150 something bucks
[02:34:47.480 --> 02:34:51.040]  because it's such as expensive proprietary formula similar stuff 300 to
[02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:56.240]  $600 it's a $94 today it's our highest quality most expensive product for
[02:34:56.240 --> 02:35:00.080]  those that want to experience well just experience for yourself bare minimum
[02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:02.720]  you're funding the broadcast but at this price you're not really funding it
[02:35:02.720 --> 02:35:09.360]  info wars life.com or 888-253-3139 but my point in ranting about the water
[02:35:09.360 --> 02:35:13.080]  filtration is we sell the highest quality gravity fed filters that cut out the
[02:35:13.080 --> 02:35:19.080]  fluoride if the glyphosate all of it it's insane if you're not filtering your
[02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:22.520]  water it's the number one thing you can do you can fund the broadcast get your
[02:35:22.520 --> 02:35:28.200]  g2 pro on systems we're clearly filtered in others an infowarstore.com
[02:35:28.200 --> 02:35:36.040]  that's infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139 now let's race through your calls or if
[02:35:36.040 --> 02:35:41.000]  not David can get to them after the break let's talk to Gerald in Arkansas
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:46.000]  Gerald you're on the air thanks for holding yeah Alex you guys are doing a
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:49.760]  great job but you're the only one out there I know because I've been around a
[02:35:49.760 --> 02:35:54.200]  while I'm a former Marine I served under John F Kennedy I've done my homework
[02:35:54.200 --> 02:35:58.400]  to the military industrial complex all these different things you're saying
[02:35:58.400 --> 02:36:03.720]  you're the only one I know that is daily putting this out and those that will
[02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:08.560]  listen they're they're heeding the call but we just have to keep putting it out
[02:36:08.560 --> 02:36:14.680]  there like you're doing not opinion but fact and and but the one thing that I
[02:36:14.680 --> 02:36:19.880]  see that has been missing not just from you but what you were talking about
[02:36:19.880 --> 02:36:25.360]  Admiralty law well really what we're under is uniform commercial code yes
[02:36:25.360 --> 02:36:30.720]  that's just realizing of everything and but the common law Alex here's the thing
[02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:37.080]  I don't hear talked about common law is still the law look up put under and
[02:36:37.080 --> 02:36:43.000]  Google under uniform commercial code and then one day one oh six common law it
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:48.920]  explains we can bring a common law action against this crap let me add
[02:36:48.920 --> 02:36:54.080]  something I was recently in a court case that I was victorious in private
[02:36:54.080 --> 02:36:58.640]  matter but I was victorious in it and my lawyers with common law trumped all the
[02:36:58.640 --> 02:37:03.480]  BS and brought in Magna Carta era information and the judge accepted it
[02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:08.160]  you're absolutely right common law trumps everything
[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:13.720]  amen now listen please and I will get up but here's the thing I send the IRS and
[02:37:13.720 --> 02:37:20.560]  I'm being open here they challenged me years ago I was a taxpayer and all this
[02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:27.120]  crap because I was ignorant but I was open-minded and so Joe Bannister is the
[02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:34.360]  one that that one of the ones that taught me God use him you hi armor
[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:38.640]  treasure agent really good guy yeah yeah yeah and see here's the thing God use
[02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:44.160]  the you uses it's the truth it's the truth there is no substitute anyway I
[02:37:44.160 --> 02:37:49.160]  send them a bill of debt under the Constitution a bill of attainer clause of
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:56.320]  the Constitution for the United States this this is all of a constitutional so
[02:37:56.320 --> 02:38:00.960]  David Knight is right you're right and this is how you just you just the
[02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:05.520]  documented this is how we kind of these people they can't answer this Alex you
[02:38:05.520 --> 02:38:10.240]  know what the IRS I've gotten letters from all these different agencies and
[02:38:10.240 --> 02:38:15.080]  when I keep sending back these court cases of Joe Bannister and Dale Long in
[02:38:15.080 --> 02:38:21.520]  93 were a full failure to file its hard work and once a jury hears all this they
[02:38:21.520 --> 02:38:25.320]  they fill it out that's why the IRS are now losing a lot of its cases
[02:38:25.320 --> 02:38:29.760]  absolutely the enemy is very afraid right now appreciate your call the IRS
[02:38:29.760 --> 02:38:33.880]  folks collects for the private fellow dessert we didn't have until 1913 great
[02:38:33.880 --> 02:38:38.200]  great points I'm going to move quick here let's go ahead and talk to Rob in
[02:38:38.200 --> 02:38:41.520]  Missouri you're on the air what's your solution to defeat this attempted gun
[02:38:41.520 --> 02:38:46.840]  grab well hi Alex and David I think that the key to our taking our Republic
[02:38:46.840 --> 02:38:50.240]  back is to educate the people what their rights and their protections are under
[02:38:50.240 --> 02:38:54.920]  the existing law we don't need new laws we got plenty of laws people don't know
[02:38:54.920 --> 02:38:58.920]  what the laws are people may give up their guns during a gun confiscation
[02:38:58.920 --> 02:39:05.680]  because they don't know that the US code title 42 section 5207 states that the
[02:39:05.680 --> 02:39:10.280]  confiscation of firearms is prohibited the president can make all the UN and the
[02:39:10.280 --> 02:39:15.560]  foreign treaties that he likes but really that they have no teeth because
[02:39:15.560 --> 02:39:20.120]  let's expand on that I mean let's briefly expand on it and make your
[02:39:20.120 --> 02:39:23.520]  court point about the Supreme Court he's saying the borders are wide open without
[02:39:23.520 --> 02:39:28.000]  a law he's saying shut down power plants without a law he's saying that the FCC
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:31.760]  takes over the Internet without a law exactly and even the laws can be trumped
[02:39:31.760 --> 02:39:35.320]  by the Constitution when they violate the people's basic rights the bill of
[02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:42.320]  rights or under Article 9 what was already there as a free human absolutely
[02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:47.720]  it's all total fraud a final comment on that I want to get David Knight's take
[02:39:47.720 --> 02:39:57.560]  on 354 US 1 1956 states that and there is no law no foreign no foreign treaty
[02:39:57.560 --> 02:40:01.960]  that can trump or usurp the US Constitution and the bill of rights and
[02:40:01.960 --> 02:40:06.440]  also the president one of his few powers is to make treaties I mean that's one of
[02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:10.640]  the few things that article 2 of the Constitution grants him his powers are to
[02:40:10.640 --> 02:40:16.000]  command the military to seek and to give opinions to the Congress and then to
[02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:21.720]  grant pardons and to make appointments that's the limit of his powers
[02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:25.960]  according to the Constitution we're out of time right now gotta jump thanks for
[02:40:25.960 --> 02:40:28.960]  calling we're gonna come back over the special report after the break and David
[02:40:28.960 --> 02:40:33.280]  will finish up with your calls and go into overdrive if he so wishes again
[02:40:33.280 --> 02:40:36.600]  David we got about one minute before we go to this report that my son put
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:41.520]  together put a book in on what you just heard I would quote G Edward Griffin
[02:40:41.520 --> 02:40:45.360]  where he said we have to stand collectively for individual rights and
[02:40:45.360 --> 02:40:48.240]  that's what we're gonna have to do we're gonna have to do that at the local
[02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:52.680]  level we need to do things like stand up at these agenda 21 meetings they they've
[02:40:52.680 --> 02:40:56.320]  got a United Nations agenda they tell people that this is something that we're
[02:40:56.320 --> 02:40:59.520]  doing locally in your community we want your input they don't want your input
[02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:04.080]  the whole thing is a deception and so as you point out earlier Alex just like a
[02:41:04.080 --> 02:41:07.560]  chicken that starts jumping up and down when a weasel gets in there that's what
[02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:10.760]  we need to do we need to wake up each other but we need to stand collectively
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:14.840]  at the local level it's not sexy to do it at the local level it's very sexy to
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:18.600]  do it at the national level but this whole thing with the Republicans now is
[02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:22.560]  just a distraction Boehner is nothing but a distraction he's totally irrelevant
[02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:25.760]  he's not gonna do anything all these trials at the doing are just show
[02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:30.520]  trials that's right thank you so much David Knight you'll be back to complete
[02:41:30.520 --> 02:41:34.800]  the transmission after the break coming up David Knight will also be hosting
[02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:39.080]  with Leanne McAdoo, Jacarie Jackson, Rob Dove, Darren McBreen and so many other
[02:41:39.080 --> 02:41:43.520]  great reporters, M4s, Nightly News, 7 o'clock central standard time,
[02:41:43.520 --> 02:41:47.440]  Wheat Nights and of course that is on some cable and TV systems now we're
[02:41:47.440 --> 02:41:50.600]  working on getting a big list of that together in the satellite systems here
[02:41:50.600 --> 02:41:54.760]  very very soon that's next on our agenda also the redesign of infowars.com
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:41:58.160]  and prisenplanet.com so we're working very hard and thanks to all your
[02:41:58.160 --> 02:42:01.880]  support we're able to do it please consider becoming a member of

[02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:37.760]  prisenplanet.tv now here is the debut of my son not wearing a mask like he did
[02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:41.920]  in some of the earlier reports this is Rex Jones 12 years old he pretty much put
[02:42:41.920 --> 02:42:45.320]  this report together himself with Buckley Hammond and so here it is on the
[02:42:45.320 --> 02:42:50.080]  good the bad the ugly of the robot rise of the drone
[02:42:56.720 --> 02:43:05.360]  Hi I'm Rex Jones and this is a report about drones. What are drones? What are
[02:43:05.360 --> 02:43:10.960]  their uses in today's society? Will they make humanity obsolete compared to the
[02:43:10.960 --> 02:43:16.360]  new age of robotics and computer chips of tomorrow?
[02:43:18.520 --> 02:43:24.360]  What exactly is a civilian drone? A civilian drone is a drone that won't
[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:30.840]  attack you, spy on you, or tase you in any way shape or form. These civilian
[02:43:30.840 --> 02:43:35.760]  drones normally go for a non-threatening look and style and approach like this
[02:43:35.760 --> 02:43:40.680]  little thing over here they're used in filming, photography, and just old
[02:43:40.680 --> 02:43:46.040]  plane recreational fun. In the media drones are becoming more and more popular
[02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:51.360]  using drones in films is actually one of the number one new filmmakers trends
[02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:57.000]  that is going on in the USA today. Later we're gonna have an expert veteran drone
[02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:01.640]  operator come on the show and have him explain to us all the little quirks and
[02:44:01.640 --> 02:44:06.720]  kinks that these drones have to offer. Before we go to our expert I would just
[02:44:06.720 --> 02:44:13.400]  like to explain to you a few facts about drones. A drone as Wikipedia and Webster
[02:44:13.400 --> 02:44:19.320]  describe it is an unmanned aircraft or ship guided by remote control or onboard
[02:44:19.320 --> 02:44:26.600]  computer. When operating a drone the owner must have a direct line of sight
[02:44:26.600 --> 02:44:31.520]  the direct line of sight allows the owner of the drone to fly it safely and to
[02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:37.320]  make sure he does not get disoriented. Now let's take a look at the job market
[02:44:37.320 --> 02:44:43.040]  with more and more drones being spat out of factories the jobs are opening up.
[02:44:43.040 --> 02:44:49.280]  Amazon is looking for drone pilots to drop gifts off at people's houses and
[02:44:49.280 --> 02:44:54.080]  all sorts of other companies are lining up and making sure they hire for new
[02:44:54.080 --> 02:44:58.920]  drone operators. So hey if you're a hobbyist you just got a job. Now that
[02:44:58.920 --> 02:45:03.360]  we've covered the basics of drones let's go to a real expert. I would like to
[02:45:03.360 --> 02:45:09.860]  introduce you to Gerard of IM Aerial. How does a drone work? Surprisingly the
[02:45:09.860 --> 02:45:14.200]  technology of drones is a lot like cell phones. Basically cell phones have a GPS
[02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:18.720]  they have what they call an IMU which tells you its orientation they have a
[02:45:18.720 --> 02:45:22.720]  compass. So basically these are the same kind of things that you find in a drone
[02:45:22.720 --> 02:45:28.440]  a GPS internally you'll have a compass exactly here you'll have a place where
[02:45:28.440 --> 02:45:32.880]  you can attach your camera. So really the technology is very similar to a
[02:45:32.880 --> 02:45:37.960]  cell phone. I'm looking at this this is a battery right? Yep. So what makes this so
[02:45:37.960 --> 02:45:44.440]  different than the average Duracell D or AA battery you buy at Target? First of
[02:45:44.440 --> 02:45:49.440]  all it's a lithium polymer battery and it's it's very light and it's a very
[02:45:49.440 --> 02:45:54.200]  high voltage so it gives these these guys a lot of thrust and gets them up in
[02:45:54.200 --> 02:46:00.960]  the air and flying for a good amount of time. Amazon is looking at hiring ex
[02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:07.280]  military personnel to fly drones and deliver packages to their customers. How
[02:46:07.280 --> 02:46:10.920]  do you feel about that and what are some problems there? Well I think it's a really
[02:46:10.920 --> 02:46:15.960]  neat concept I think a lot of things need to be figured out as far as you
[02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:20.600]  know allowing these drones to travel through cities and buildings and just
[02:46:20.600 --> 02:46:25.080]  being very careful and mindful of where these things go especially when you lose
[02:46:25.080 --> 02:46:29.560]  sight of them and that's a big thing with flying drones that you always want
[02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:34.880]  to have line of sight. What happens when a drone gets out of control like take
[02:46:34.880 --> 02:46:40.160]  this one article for example drone owner located after device lands in
[02:46:40.160 --> 02:46:46.400]  family's backyard there's some obvious concerns about privacy there. Sure yeah
[02:46:46.400 --> 02:46:51.600]  and you know that's a very unfortunate case and it doesn't happen all the time
[02:46:51.600 --> 02:46:58.880]  but sometimes if the battery runs out or there's some pilot air the the drone
[02:46:58.880 --> 02:47:04.080]  will fly away and fortunately with a lot of these systems is built in what they
[02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:09.440]  call return to home so for example with this this remote if I just powered off
[02:47:09.440 --> 02:47:13.280]  the drone knows to automatically come back to the point where I launched it
[02:47:13.280 --> 02:47:17.680]  from because it's locked in by the GPS. The government has started to put kill
[02:47:17.680 --> 02:47:23.000]  switches into these drones to where it's in the firmware to restrict drone
[02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:29.360]  usage in certain areas. If I was flying this drone near the White House or any
[02:47:29.360 --> 02:47:34.400]  other top-secret government area it would immediately fall out of the sky or
[02:47:34.400 --> 02:47:37.880]  just return to home. The most important thing I think it's a safety issue and
[02:47:37.880 --> 02:47:42.280]  for example if you try to fly these drones within five miles of an airport
[02:47:42.280 --> 02:47:46.400]  you can literally be flying and it's almost like it hits a brick wall and
[02:47:46.400 --> 02:47:52.560]  it will just not go into that airspace. This is designed by for a reason right
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:57.520]  we don't want drones in the airspace of planes and all that kind of stuff. But the
[02:47:57.520 --> 02:48:02.760]  problem with that is that when they get when we come out with like you know how
[02:48:02.760 --> 02:48:05.960]  Google's talking always talking about smart cars and smart planes that will
[02:48:05.960 --> 02:48:10.640]  self-drive. The problem is what would happen if the firmware was in those as
[02:48:10.640 --> 02:48:14.800]  well in one day if it was in a computer chip that could be implanted into
[02:48:14.800 --> 02:48:19.520]  humans. So there's concerns there about the government regulating. Yeah
[02:48:19.520 --> 02:48:24.200]  absolutely. Gerard it was great to have you here. Thank you Rex appreciate it. In this
[02:48:24.200 --> 02:48:28.600]  chilling commercial put out by the Pennsylvania Tax Committee they brag
[02:48:28.600 --> 02:48:34.280]  about how they might use drones to track us and spy on us. They claim that they
[02:48:34.280 --> 02:48:37.960]  would only use it on tax cheats but what if you were a government dissident. This
[02:48:37.960 --> 02:48:43.960]  easy pay online by June 18th and we'll skip your penalty and take half off your
[02:48:43.960 --> 02:48:52.840]  interest because Tom we do know who you are. Now that we're done with consumer
[02:48:52.840 --> 02:48:57.040]  drones it's time to move on to military and law enforcement drones. These drones
[02:48:57.040 --> 02:49:02.120]  go from tiny nano spy drones that they're using in Iraq to track criminals to
[02:49:02.120 --> 02:49:07.640]  the giant Reaper drones which can fire four hellfire missiles raining down on
[02:49:07.640 --> 02:49:12.840]  villages. Let's go through a few info wars dot com articles about the drone
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:19.320]  threat today. U.S. drone kills four Al Qaeda suspects not confirmed in Yemen.
[02:49:19.320 --> 02:49:24.200]  Says here a U.S. drone killed four suspected Al Qaeda militants in the
[02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:29.720]  northeast Yemen on Monday morning officials and tribesmen said. I wonder
[02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:33.800]  how many other people got hurt by the shrapnel in the blast because this was
[02:49:33.800 --> 02:49:37.560]  in a village this was not out in the middle of nowhere. Now it's like the
[02:49:37.560 --> 02:49:43.000]  law enforcement side of things. Riot control drone to shoot pepper spray
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:49.240]  blips at protesters how nice for decades now riot control has always been a
[02:49:49.240 --> 02:49:53.400]  government must have. There are a lot of these riot control drones and I want to
[02:49:53.400 --> 02:49:59.320]  go to another one a DHS funded taser drone that was launched right here in
[02:49:59.320 --> 02:50:06.280]  Texas. Montgomery County in Texas spent two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
[02:50:06.280 --> 02:50:13.320]  on a taser drone that can follow a suspect and shoot four barbed electrodes
[02:50:13.320 --> 02:50:16.920]  that can be shot at a distance of a hundred feet delivering
[02:50:16.920 --> 02:50:22.280]  neuromuscular incapacitation to the victim. I think this is a very proactive
[02:50:22.280 --> 02:50:26.040]  way to steal our rights. Well we've learned a lot about drones today but
[02:50:26.040 --> 02:50:30.040]  that's not all. Go online and be active and find more knowledge.
[02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:36.120]  infowars.com is in a bad place to start either so have fun.
[02:50:36.120 --> 02:50:59.000]  I'm Rex Jones reporting for infowars.com.
[02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:02.840]  This is Dan Pilla. Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay? Are tax debts

[02:51:54.200 --> 02:52:00.280]  The future of talk radio GCN. Hi folks Alex Jones here with some important
[02:52:00.280 --> 02:52:03.080]  information. I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk
[02:52:03.080 --> 02:52:06.200]  and his team of patriots over at MyPatriot Supply.
[02:52:06.200 --> 02:52:09.160]  Several years ago Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment
[02:52:09.160 --> 02:52:12.360]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans
[02:52:12.360 --> 02:52:16.600]  willing to sell us out for a quick buck. Deciding to take action, a company run
[02:52:16.600 --> 02:52:21.000]  by patriots for patriots was born. MyPatriot Supply has never taken
[02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:24.680]  a loan or accepted outside funding. They now operate two distribution
[02:52:24.680 --> 02:52:28.680]  facilities and employ over 50 hardworking American men and women.
[02:52:28.680 --> 02:52:31.880]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach
[02:52:31.880 --> 02:52:36.680]  and that's why I stock MyPantry with high quality storeable foods from MyPatriot
[02:52:36.680 --> 02:52:40.280]  Supply. Go to MyPatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex

[02:53:00.520 --> 02:53:04.520]  that 60% of our bodies are made of water. Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[02:53:04.520 --> 02:53:07.960]  It's the cleanest best water ever. Mom says it's because the Berkey's
[02:53:07.960 --> 02:53:11.080]  filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure
[02:53:11.080 --> 02:53:14.520]  delicious water. I know right? You love it too!
[02:53:14.520 --> 02:53:18.600]  Yeah I'm thirsty too. Let's go get some. Get Berkey clean water by calling
[02:53:18.600 --> 02:53:27.640]  877-886-3653. That's 877-886-3653 or visit goberkey.com.
[02:53:27.640 --> 02:53:31.720]  It's happening again. The Feds are trying to ban your freedom to own body
[02:53:31.720 --> 02:53:35.960]  armor. In January a newly introduced bill HR 378
[02:53:35.960 --> 02:53:39.960]  will take away your right to buy level three and higher body armor.
[02:53:39.960 --> 02:53:44.040]  Katie Armor offers the most affordable level three body armor packages on the
[02:53:44.040 --> 02:53:48.200]  market today. Protect yourself. Buy your body armor now

[02:54:04.120 --> 02:54:07.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight in studio. We've had Alex
[02:54:07.240 --> 02:54:10.600]  joining us on the road. We're going to go to your calls in just a moment. We just
[02:54:10.600 --> 02:54:14.840]  heard that special report from Alex's son Rex Jones.
[02:54:14.840 --> 02:54:18.520]  That's parents. That's a great way to get your kids
[02:54:18.520 --> 02:54:21.560]  going on things that are going to matter for their life. Let them pursue their
[02:54:21.560 --> 02:54:24.440]  interests. We tend to over protect our children especially
[02:54:24.440 --> 02:54:26.520]  today and say well you've got to wait until your
[02:54:26.520 --> 02:54:30.040]  certain age to do this or do that. I'm not a big fan of that kind of
[02:54:30.040 --> 02:54:33.560]  approach to parenting. A lot of homeschoolers know that kids can do
[02:54:33.560 --> 02:54:37.800]  a lot more than we give them credit for. Great report from
[02:54:37.800 --> 02:54:41.080]  Rex about drones and of course that's a burgeoning industry
[02:54:41.080 --> 02:54:47.800]  that the FAA is moving to shut down. Finding people for flying a five pound
[02:54:47.800 --> 02:54:51.240]  styrofoam plane, finding them $10,000,
[02:54:51.240 --> 02:54:56.600]  mandating that you have to have commercially trained pilots to fly
[02:54:56.600 --> 02:54:59.880]  these drones, as well as watchers. They're going to load that up with
[02:54:59.880 --> 02:55:03.320]  regulations to try to take that over just like the FCC is trying to take over
[02:55:03.320 --> 02:55:05.960]  the internet, just like the FTC is trying to take over the internet.
[02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:10.360]  Got the FAA, the FCC, the FTC. If we don't get these guys under control,
[02:55:10.360 --> 02:55:14.040]  we are truly going to be effed completely.
[02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:17.800]  That's what we've got. We've got to stop down these burgeoning
[02:55:17.800 --> 02:55:21.080]  bureaucracies. But let's go to your calls right now. We've got Shelley. We're also
[02:55:21.080 --> 02:55:24.600]  going to try to go to Chad, Todd, Erin, Dan. We'll go in to Overdrive to try to
[02:55:24.600 --> 02:55:28.040]  get everybody. Appreciate you holding. Let's go to Shelley in Tennessee.
[02:55:28.040 --> 02:55:33.400]  Shelley? Hey, you know I just happened to catch the
[02:55:33.400 --> 02:55:38.280]  Knoxville News Sentinel, the local newspaper here.
[02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:44.920]  There was an attempted entry into the Y-12 national complex
[02:55:44.920 --> 02:55:52.280]  by an Arabic guy. His last name was Malakar.
[02:55:52.280 --> 02:55:59.960]  What kind of a complex is that? It's the Y-12 national security complex.
[02:55:59.960 --> 02:56:04.600]  They store stuff there. I'm not really sure.
[02:56:04.600 --> 02:56:08.680]  I don't have a clearance, so I wouldn't know.
[02:56:08.680 --> 02:56:12.120]  Well, it's interesting. There's a lot of these stories that pick up
[02:56:12.120 --> 02:56:16.200]  locally that don't go national, and we don't realize how close we are
[02:56:16.200 --> 02:56:19.800]  not even to people breaking into a secure facility and doing something
[02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:23.960]  malicious, but just out of even, let's say, sheer incompetence, if that's what's
[02:56:23.960 --> 02:56:26.600]  going on in the story that we've been following into
[02:56:26.600 --> 02:56:30.280]  Lane at the primate center, where this very dangerous
[02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:34.040]  bacteria they brought into the country to weaponize, somehow it got out of their
[02:56:34.040 --> 02:56:39.320]  biosafety lab level three lab, into the outdoor cages, which are
[02:56:39.320 --> 02:56:41.560]  right next door to wetlands, a neighborhood, a school.
[02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:44.440]  I mean, you know, how did that happen? They still don't know.
[02:56:44.440 --> 02:56:48.520]  They sent back another crew to try to investigate how that breach occurred,
[02:56:48.520 --> 02:56:52.200]  and if it's escaped beyond that area. What happened in Tennessee, though?
[02:56:52.200 --> 02:56:55.400]  What did the local news say about that? Did he get in?
[02:56:55.400 --> 02:57:00.040]  No, of course he didn't, but you know, just the fact that he even attempted,
[02:57:00.040 --> 02:57:04.520]  and he just walks in to the visitor's center, and he went
[02:57:04.520 --> 02:57:09.480]  through a back door, and it was like a Friday evening, about 6.30, I guess,
[02:57:09.480 --> 02:57:13.400]  and somebody caught up to him, and you know,
[02:57:13.400 --> 02:57:17.320]  probably today, what are you doing? And he demanded a tour,
[02:57:17.320 --> 02:57:20.280]  and of course they told him to go pound sand,
[02:57:20.280 --> 02:57:23.960]  so he left there, and they mostly called the police,
[02:57:23.960 --> 02:57:27.400]  and he left there, and he went right down the road, because we have like three
[02:57:27.400 --> 02:57:31.480]  complexes here that are ran by the Department of Energy,
[02:57:31.480 --> 02:57:35.640]  and so he went right down the road to the Oak Ridge National Lab,
[02:57:35.640 --> 02:57:41.240]  and he drove up to the front gate, and of course, you know, it's secured also,
[02:57:41.240 --> 02:57:44.280]  you know, you have to have a badge to get in, and you know,
[02:57:44.280 --> 02:57:48.680]  security denied him access there, and he demanded a tour to get into there,
[02:57:48.680 --> 02:57:53.720]  and that's when the cops picked him up, but he was,
[02:57:53.720 --> 02:57:58.440]  he had a California driver's license, which was suspended,
[02:57:58.440 --> 02:58:02.280]  and his vehicle was registered in Texas.
[02:58:02.280 --> 02:58:05.720]  Yeah, he probably just walked across the border, we've got open borders, so if we
[02:58:05.720 --> 02:58:08.200]  got open borders, it's going to be pretty hard to try to
[02:58:08.200 --> 02:58:11.080]  catch anybody that's coming in, but you know the interesting thing about the
[02:58:11.080 --> 02:58:15.080]  open borders is they're not open if you're flying in, or if you're
[02:58:15.080 --> 02:58:17.240]  trying to get out, and when we look at the way they
[02:58:17.240 --> 02:58:20.440]  scrutinize people traveling by air travel, and the way they keep the other
[02:58:20.440 --> 02:58:23.320]  borders completely open, that should give us a clue that the
[02:58:23.320 --> 02:58:26.040]  real danger is to close those borders.
[02:58:26.040 --> 02:58:29.400]  We need to stop the incentives that are pulling people in. We'll be right back
[02:58:29.400 --> 02:58:39.240]  with more of your calls, stay with us.
[02:58:41.560 --> 02:58:48.840]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:48.840 --> 02:58:52.520]  Sold out for weeks through the difficult and extensive proprietary process
[02:58:52.520 --> 02:58:55.080]  behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life
[02:58:55.080 --> 02:58:57.800]  secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[02:58:57.800 --> 02:59:01.640]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted
[02:59:01.640 --> 02:59:05.160]  and developed over the last two years, and is based on cellular science
[02:59:05.160 --> 02:59:08.360]  of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[02:59:08.360 --> 02:59:12.360]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic,
[02:59:12.360 --> 02:59:16.920]  and could not be properly absorbed by the body. Secret 12 is a binary of
[02:59:16.920 --> 02:59:22.440]  nutromedical grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12, methylcobalamin, the same
[02:59:22.440 --> 02:59:26.280]  kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin, the most
[02:59:26.280 --> 02:59:29.720]  bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[02:59:29.720 --> 02:59:32.840]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:59:32.840 --> 02:59:37.000]  No needles, no injections. Don't take my word for it. Try it for yourself.
[02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:41.720]  Discover the secret. Secret 12. Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.

[02:59:51.320 --> 02:59:56.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:00.200 --> 03:00:03.800]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[03:00:03.800 --> 03:00:09.880]  the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:00:09.880 --> 03:00:13.400]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, and we're in overdrive. I
[03:00:13.400 --> 03:00:17.240]  wanted to give Aaron, Chad, Todd, Luke a chance to
[03:00:17.240 --> 03:00:19.640]  call. So we're going to go to those calls right away. Try to move through them
[03:00:19.640 --> 03:00:24.200]  very quickly. Let's go to Aaron in California, Aaron.
[03:00:24.200 --> 03:00:28.120]  Go ahead, Aaron. Hey. Hey, go ahead. I just want to say that
[03:00:28.120 --> 03:00:30.680]  I just want to say that if Alex Jones is listening,
[03:00:30.680 --> 03:00:38.280]  he's my hero. I'm sorry. Yeah, let's okay. Let's go to Chad in North Carolina.
[03:00:38.280 --> 03:00:43.720]  Chad? Hey, how's it going? Long-time fan, first-time caller, and I was
[03:00:43.720 --> 03:00:48.920]  wondering if there were any follow-ups to the FCC situation going on with
[03:00:48.920 --> 03:00:52.360]  their taker of the internet, which is completely insane, and
[03:00:52.360 --> 03:00:56.920]  exactly what the objective of the FTC involvement there is.
[03:00:56.920 --> 03:00:59.640]  Well, you know, that's interesting, Chad, because we've had a lot of people,
[03:00:59.640 --> 03:01:03.160]  especially in the liberal press, who say, isn't this great? We now have
[03:01:03.160 --> 03:01:07.640]  net neutrality. Thank you so much, FCC. It's been a week. We haven't even seen
[03:01:07.640 --> 03:01:11.160]  the rules that they passed. And we've got a Congress that is so
[03:01:11.160 --> 03:01:14.280]  incredibly passive. They're not doing anything about it.
[03:01:14.280 --> 03:01:17.160]  That's one of the reasons why when I looked at this bill to shut down the
[03:01:17.160 --> 03:01:21.160]  ATF, my first response, I don't know what the Congress
[03:01:21.160 --> 03:01:24.440]  can do to try to get control of these bureaucracies that they created and
[03:01:24.440 --> 03:01:27.000]  abdicated their authority to. One of the things they can do is to cut
[03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.800]  their budget. We saw that as part of the fight to try to
[03:01:29.800 --> 03:01:34.360]  control Obama's edicts for open borders. They said, let's
[03:01:34.360 --> 03:01:38.120]  control the budget for the Department of Homeland Security. But then,
[03:01:38.120 --> 03:01:41.560]  of course, they cave. They couldn't do that. That's about the only thing they
[03:01:41.560 --> 03:01:45.000]  can do at this point is to cut their budgets. But, of course, the FCC is now
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:48.040]  going to assert that they have control over the Internet. That's the
[03:01:48.040 --> 03:01:51.160]  important thing to understand, Chad. We don't know what they're going to do
[03:01:51.160 --> 03:01:53.880]  with net neutrality. And, of course, we've had a functioning
[03:01:53.880 --> 03:01:57.880]  Internet for decades. It served us just fine. That's an issue that was a couple
[03:01:57.880 --> 03:02:01.240]  of years old that was negotiated between the competing companies. They
[03:02:01.240 --> 03:02:04.840]  worked that out. It's not a crisis. It's not a problem. The
[03:02:04.840 --> 03:02:08.680]  Internet is not broken. They merely want to assert control,
[03:02:08.680 --> 03:02:11.480]  and they're still not telling us what they're going to do with these
[03:02:11.480 --> 03:02:15.320]  regulations a week afterward. That's the takeaway from this, is the
[03:02:15.320 --> 03:02:20.280]  arrogance of these regulatory agencies that won't even tell Congress, let alone
[03:02:20.280 --> 03:02:23.800]  the public, what they're going to do. And we're still waiting for an answer as to
[03:02:23.800 --> 03:02:26.600]  what they're doing. Does that answer your question?
[03:02:26.600 --> 03:02:31.720]  Yeah, yeah. And I was watching a documentary the day before yesterday about
[03:02:31.720 --> 03:02:36.600]  via the Turning with the Enemies Act, how we all considered enemies of the
[03:02:36.600 --> 03:02:40.360]  state, which is insane. And I think that had something to do
[03:02:40.360 --> 03:02:45.240]  with the Federal Reserve taking away private ownership of gold and
[03:02:45.240 --> 03:02:47.960]  mass amounts. Well, the Federal Reserve is definitely the bottom of this, but we
[03:02:47.960 --> 03:02:50.920]  just talked to Bear Brown yesterday. And in that railroaded case, they
[03:02:50.920 --> 03:02:54.680]  confiscated his Declaration of Independence. The FBI said it was proof that he was
[03:02:54.680 --> 03:02:58.360]  a radical. They were going to keep it. And there's actually an order that he
[03:02:58.360 --> 03:03:02.120]  tweeted out that showed the judge saying, no, I know you were going to keep
[03:03:02.120 --> 03:03:04.680]  his Declaration of Independence as part of the plea bargaining, but you need to
[03:03:04.680 --> 03:03:08.520]  give it back to him. But you know what? He only got back was a piece of paper.
[03:03:08.520 --> 03:03:12.840]  They kept his rights, and they're taking your rights that same way. Thank you,
[03:03:12.840 --> 03:03:16.040]  Chad. Let's go on to Todd in California. Todd?
[03:03:16.040 --> 03:03:19.320]  Hello, David. I've got a lot of info, so I'm just going to try to get it out
[03:03:19.320 --> 03:03:22.600]  quickly. First of all, I think the overall
[03:03:22.600 --> 03:03:26.040]  disinfo operations of the globalists, they see it in two different fronts.
[03:03:26.040 --> 03:03:28.840]  There's the public front where the general public is
[03:03:28.840 --> 03:03:33.640]  vastly, you know, way too dumb down to ever, you know,
[03:03:33.640 --> 03:03:38.200]  be used to anyone. And then there's the law enforcement front where
[03:03:38.200 --> 03:03:42.280]  they're trying to keep people in government totally compartmentalized
[03:03:42.280 --> 03:03:47.800]  so that they're pretty much ineffective.
[03:03:47.800 --> 03:03:51.000]  And so the reason why I think the question has been asked,
[03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:55.640]  why are they exponentially going for broke on so many fronts,
[03:03:55.640 --> 03:03:59.160]  is because I think they have noticed that
[03:03:59.160 --> 03:04:03.560]  as far as law enforcement is concerned, people in government
[03:04:03.560 --> 03:04:07.800]  have started to wake up a lot quicker than they predicted.
[03:04:07.800 --> 03:04:11.800]  I agree. Yeah, I agree. And that's why they got to get control of the internet.
[03:04:11.800 --> 03:04:15.800]  Absolutely. I want to move real quickly to, thanks Todd. I want to move real
[03:04:15.800 --> 03:04:19.240]  quickly to Luke. I think, are you calling from Vietnam, Luke?
[03:04:19.240 --> 03:04:24.520]  Yes, I'm calling from Vietnam. I actually was listening to you yesterday
[03:04:24.520 --> 03:04:30.200]  talking about Barrett Lancaster Brown, who is charged by the FBI.
[03:04:30.200 --> 03:04:33.240]  It's something very similar to me. I've talked about before, I won't talk about
[03:04:33.240 --> 03:04:37.000]  my own saga again of obtaining information on a law enforcement officer.
[03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:41.720]  But something our cases have in common is that the state has gone after our
[03:04:41.720 --> 03:04:44.680]  family members as well in both of our cases.
[03:04:44.680 --> 03:04:48.520]  Yes, like they did with Barrett Brown. I'm sorry, you know, call in,
[03:04:48.520 --> 03:04:51.960]  we'll put you at the head of the line. We've run out of time and overdrive.
[03:04:51.960 --> 03:04:55.080]  I'm sorry I didn't see that you were calling from Vietnam earlier.
[03:04:55.080 --> 03:04:57.960]  I would have gotten to you sooner. Call us back. We'll put you at the head of the
[03:04:57.960 --> 03:05:19.720]  line. Thanks so much.
