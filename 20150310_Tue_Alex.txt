[00:00:04.983 --> 00:00:09.810]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.392]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.392 --> 00:00:12.934]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.934 --> 00:00:17.140]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.205]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.206 --> 00:00:31.648]  Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen, on this live worldwide broadcast.
[00:00:31.648 --> 00:00:37.132]  I'm Alex Jones, on the road with my family, coming to you from the Texas coast.
[00:00:37.132 --> 00:00:43.636]  And David Knight, of course, is in the big official InfoWars.com studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:00:43.636 --> 00:00:50.701]  And we'll cut to David Knight so he can give you a preview of some of the topics and issues he's going to be raising today.
[00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:56.865]  And believe me, there's a lot of them, a lot of special reports, a lot of different important news developments.
[00:00:57.325 --> 00:01:01.248]  That we're going to be bringing you live from the InfoWars studio.
[00:01:01.248 --> 00:01:06.953]  I'm going to be here as well, going over just the epic level movement of tyranny.
[00:01:06.953 --> 00:01:14.138]  And I use that word epic a lot because what we're seeing is over-the-top epic, seismic in its ramifications.
[00:01:14.138 --> 00:01:19.282]  Whether we submit to it or don't submit to it, the hammer has fallen.
[00:01:19.282 --> 00:01:24.226]  The globalists are moving at full speed worldwide, not just here in the United States.
[00:01:25.507 --> 00:01:30.571]  Fifty-two senators warn of sweeping ammo bans, say Second Amendment is quote, at risk.
[00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:34.454]  Yes, the Second Amendment is being prepared to be dismantled.
[00:01:34.454 --> 00:01:39.718]  Sensenbrenner, one of the globalist members of Congress, does some good things, some bad things.
[00:01:39.718 --> 00:01:46.063]  Introduces the Real ID Act, but then supports Justin Amash and folks that are Ron Paul-esque.
[00:01:46.063 --> 00:01:50.927]  But he now has come out and wants to quote, abolish the ATF.
[00:01:52.356 --> 00:02:01.182]  But the problem with that is they would just put the agency and the very people under the DEA and the FBI.
[00:02:01.182 --> 00:02:08.927]  Now these are more competent groups, the DEA and the FBI, competent at carrying out globalist crime in many cases.
[00:02:08.927 --> 00:02:12.290]  And can you imagine the giant war on drugs apparatus?
[00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:24.722]  And the asset forfeiture seizure apparatus that's federalizing local police everywhere when they switch to the war on guns with all these nickel and dime rules and regulations that aren't even law.
[00:02:24.722 --> 00:02:29.587]  This is the war on the American gun owner promised by the globalists.
[00:02:29.587 --> 00:02:31.449]  This is a full mega...
[00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.730]  All right.
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.382]  At least at a gut level so that their evil doesn't get us too depressed while we fight them.
[00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:55.043]  So we're in the world, but not of it.
[00:02:55.043 --> 00:02:59.544]  I was going to do that today, but the Second Amendment issue is so incredibly central.
[00:02:59.544 --> 00:03:11.850]  It is Second Amendment today when we talk about callers and throughout the compendium of the broadcast interspersed with literally hundreds of different incredibly important news stories that we're going to attempt to cover.
[00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.950]  It's on.
[00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.751]  We know the enemy's plan.
[00:03:15.751 --> 00:03:17.471]  We know their operations.
[00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:19.771]  We know how they behave.
[00:03:19.771 --> 00:03:34.914]  And now they've just got to sell this to local government and the police and the military and the FBI and the ATF and others so that they believe, most of them actually believe, they're doing a hard job and the world's against them and they get, you know, attacked unfairly and things get spun.
[00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:37.635]  I mean, here's a great example and we'll cover this after the break.
[00:03:39.692 --> 00:03:46.077]  South Carolina National Guard conducts door-to-door wellness checks, gun confiscation exercises.
[00:03:46.077 --> 00:03:55.203]  Now, in this compendium, if the police and military can understand this, and if the public can understand this, it's what I call a Rosetta Stone.
[00:03:55.203 --> 00:03:56.544]  Through this, you can decode everything.
[00:03:56.544 --> 00:04:00.586]  This is just a snapshot example microcosm that hooks into everything.
[00:04:00.586 --> 00:04:02.788]  You understand the micro, you understand the macro.
[00:04:04.056 --> 00:04:08.358]  The National Guard are really hard-working, great people that do a lot of wonderful work.
[00:04:08.358 --> 00:04:11.539]  Some of the most awake people out there.
[00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:13.240]  They're not bad.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:22.644]  But it's true that when you do these wellness checks and you get the National Guard and even regular Army involved in door-to-door behavior, we've documented and it's been in the news
[00:04:23.024 --> 00:04:23.224]  That's
[00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:43.482]  Smiling faces knowing that there's a very positive view of the military and of the National Guard.
[00:04:43.482 --> 00:04:51.928]  They use them, open the door, let the nice guy in, to then let the vampire in a week later, or a month later, or a year later.
[00:04:51.928 --> 00:04:58.092]  So this is the nice little kid, the friendly kid selling lollipops, you know, or Girl Scout cookies that you let in.
[00:04:58.672 --> 00:04:59.753]  But now beyond the body...
[00:05:17.836 --> 00:05:23.360]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.304]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[00:05:29.304 --> 00:05:34.247]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[00:05:34.247 --> 00:05:38.190]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:44.414]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:05:44.794 --> 00:05:49.941]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[00:05:49.941 --> 00:05:53.686]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:55.568]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:05:59.161 --> 00:06:02.822]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:06:02.822 --> 00:06:07.103]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:06:07.103 --> 00:06:08.883]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:06:08.883 --> 00:06:14.205]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[00:06:14.205 --> 00:06:16.745]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.

[00:06:24.507 --> 00:06:27.328]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:06:28.792 --> 00:06:32.293]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:06:32.293 --> 00:06:40.536]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:06:40.536 --> 00:06:45.957]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:06:45.957 --> 00:06:48.478]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:06:58.962 --> 00:07:00.222]  Another major health threat.
[00:07:00.222 --> 00:07:05.203]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:07:05.203 --> 00:07:07.884]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:07:07.884 --> 00:07:14.926]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:07:14.926 --> 00:07:17.926]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:07:17.926 --> 00:07:20.947]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:07:20.947 --> 00:07:22.867]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:07:22.867 --> 00:07:25.748]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:07:25.828 --> 00:07:31.536]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:07:31.536 --> 00:07:35.061]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:07:35.061 --> 00:07:38.145]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:07:38.145 --> 00:07:42.431]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have.

[00:08:10.489 --> 00:08:15.006]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:08:15.006 --> 00:08:16.391]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:18.746 --> 00:08:22.530]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Tuesday, March 10, 2015.
[00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.832]  It is a huge news-breaking day.
[00:08:24.832 --> 00:08:28.995]  We've got some major moves happening, trying to ban ammunition.
[00:08:28.995 --> 00:08:32.939]  We have some different moves that are being made by Senate Republicans.
[00:08:32.939 --> 00:08:37.063]  We've got gain-of-function experiments out of control by the CDC.
[00:08:37.063 --> 00:08:41.326]  We've got the Russian people are angrier at the U.S.
[00:08:41.326 --> 00:08:42.247]  than they have ever been.
[00:08:42.247 --> 00:08:45.090]  And joining us now is Alex Jones to break this down.
[00:08:45.945 --> 00:08:46.625]  That's right.
[00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:50.067]  Again, I'm co-hosting here from the road today with David Knight.
[00:08:50.067 --> 00:08:56.251]  I'll be back tomorrow as well with David Alex Jones coming to you from Texas, the Texas coast.
[00:08:56.251 --> 00:09:02.615]  David Knight coming to you from theinfowars.com, news studios in Austin, Texas, and broadcasting worldwide.
[00:09:02.615 --> 00:09:06.177]  There is so much to cover, so much to go over today.
[00:09:07.017 --> 00:09:14.020]  The first thing I want to break down before I get into all the other news is this is going to be a Second Amendment-centered transmission.
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:22.603]  When we open the phones up towards the end of this hour and throughout the entire broadcast today, after that, I want to hear what you're planning to do to defeat the move to take our guns.
[00:09:23.203 --> 00:09:34.769]  And I want to hear what you're planning to do to get a hold of these criminal politicians to let them know they're going to be held accountable and that they're not going to use a bunch of wordsmithing and manipulation to hide what they're doing.
[00:09:34.769 --> 00:09:38.871]  Obama has promised to destroy the Second Amendment.
[00:09:38.871 --> 00:09:40.092]  His criminal attorney general
[00:09:41.343 --> 00:09:49.150]  Was caught shipping guns into Mexico and the memos came out CBS News to demonize and false flag and set up the Second Amendment.
[00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:50.731]  This is really happening.
[00:09:50.731 --> 00:09:55.675]  We have on a host of issues, open borders, total treason without even a law.
[00:09:55.675 --> 00:09:58.898]  The President's just legalizing all the illegals, giving them Social Security cards.
[00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:00.620]  That's in the news today.
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:08.386]  We have the President shutting off our energy capacity and moving our jobs overseas by design on record, globalism, to make us dependent.
[00:10:09.728 --> 00:10:11.211]  Outside of law.
[00:10:11.211 --> 00:10:13.134]  The carbon taxes, outside of law.
[00:10:13.134 --> 00:10:16.440]  The shutting down of the rest of our infrastructure, outside of law.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.267]  We have the President launching military operations outside of Congress and outside of law.
[00:10:21.328 --> 00:10:39.559]  We have the president engaging in selective enforcement via Obamacare against his political enemies, engaged in IRS witch hunts on record against whole political classes they don't like, with MSNBC traitorously admitting that they are targeting conservatives and saying, good, go after the Tea Party with the IRS.
[00:10:39.559 --> 00:10:44.722]  Not even the Nazis openly got on the radio and said, go take all of our enemies' money.
[00:10:44.722 --> 00:10:45.343]  They just did it.
[00:10:46.556 --> 00:10:49.257]  So this is the beginning of economic embargo.
[00:10:49.257 --> 00:10:57.260]  We have articles out of Nevada, this isn't out of England, where parents can't adopt children if they have concealed carry permits.
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:04.923]  You see, we are the new Jews, the new gypsies, the new underclass.
[00:11:04.923 --> 00:11:11.326]  If you're white, if you're libertarian, if you're conservative, you are open, free game for the new totalitarians
[00:11:11.946 --> 00:11:18.052]  To exercise these operations on us, but then once they're done, they're going to move on to everybody as well.
[00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:23.236]  But this is the game being played right now.
[00:11:23.236 --> 00:11:24.177]  Epic news.
[00:11:24.177 --> 00:11:29.983]  And again, I use that word a lot because what we're seeing is gargantuan power grabs.
[00:11:31.047 --> 00:11:33.308]  of the Internet, of you name it.
[00:11:33.308 --> 00:11:44.035]  Now the Republicans are proposing, and look out, they're proposing abolishing the ATF, but that only means like they abolished the Border Patrol and just put it under ice six years ago.
[00:11:44.035 --> 00:11:50.839]  No, they are moving for a long time ATF under the DEA and the FBI.
[00:11:50.839 --> 00:11:57.684]  We're going to be talking about that with David Knight here in just a moment, to give them the incredible reach of informants and power
[00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:08.432]  To now totally criminalize gun owners with a bunch of invisible regulations and red tape to then throw people in jail for bullets, for gun accessories, you name it.
[00:12:08.432 --> 00:12:17.880]  The real reign of terror that Bloomberg and others promised that was microcosm in California the last three years with the Bloomberg headline, gun confiscations began in California.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.161]  It's coming.
[00:12:19.161 --> 00:12:21.842]  The veterans aren't able to buy guns in many cases now.
[00:12:21.842 --> 00:12:24.084]  No crimes, no record, no nothing.
[00:12:24.084 --> 00:12:24.524]  It's here.
[00:12:24.524 --> 00:12:28.787]  Totalitarianism via bureaucracy, incrementally being turned up.
[00:12:28.787 --> 00:12:32.750]  At a certain point, even if you're incrementally turning it up, it starts to boil.
[00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.592]  Here's the articles on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:12:35.592 --> 00:12:39.815]  52 senators, and we need to be hammering this on InfoWars.com, and we are.
[00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:46.656]  Fifty-two Senators warned of sweeping ammo bans, say Second Amendment is, quote, at risk.
[00:12:46.656 --> 00:12:47.417]  Absolutely.
[00:12:47.417 --> 00:12:52.821]  The plan has always been to be able to ban one type of rifle ammo, claiming it can kill cops.
[00:12:52.821 --> 00:12:55.002]  Well, of course it can kill cops.
[00:12:55.002 --> 00:12:58.204]  And then, I mean, any ammo can kill somebody.
[00:12:58.204 --> 00:13:01.267]  And then expanding it out basically to everything.
[00:13:03.629 --> 00:13:07.192]  52 Senators warn of sweeping ammo bans, say Second Amendment at risk.
[00:13:07.192 --> 00:13:21.364]  A majority in both the Senate and the House, 52 Senators, 238 House members have joined to oppose the Obama administration's move, well let's see them actually do something, to ban a popular type of ammo used in upselling AR-15 rifles.
[00:13:22.822 --> 00:13:26.824]  And pistols because it pierces police body armor.
[00:13:26.824 --> 00:13:43.552]  A week after House members led by Judiciary Committee Representative Bob Goodlatte, if I say that right, sent a letter of opposition to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Senator Chuck Grassley echoed that in his own letter signed by 51 others.
[00:13:43.552 --> 00:13:47.134]  We're going to be reading some of what they had to say coming up but
[00:13:48.314 --> 00:13:56.358]  If you add this into the entire attack profile, the entire constellation of what's happening, it shows that the enemy is very confident.
[00:13:56.358 --> 00:13:57.298]  Well, they shouldn't be.
[00:13:57.298 --> 00:13:59.479]  In every poll number, they're plunging.
[00:13:59.479 --> 00:14:00.840]  They're in deep political trouble.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.461]  Hillary's in big trouble.
[00:14:02.461 --> 00:14:04.282]  Obama's in big trouble.
[00:14:04.282 --> 00:14:11.965]  You read the news headlines, even his own faithful are losing faith in their Messiah, the Lord and Savior, Barack Hussein Obama, to quote Jamie Foxx.
[00:14:11.965 --> 00:14:13.146]  So why are they so confident?
[00:14:13.925 --> 00:14:38.486]  Because they have globalist backing, they have an agenda, they have staged terror up their sleeve, new big wars up their sleeve, economic crises up their sleeve, and most importantly, they have traitorous Republicans like John Boehner and others protecting the entire agenda, keeping Obamacare in place as it rapes the American people and breaks our financial back and destroys our healthcare system and federalizes it as a new enforcement spy grid.
[00:14:39.247 --> 00:14:48.837]  Breaking the country's back, ending sovereignty, ending the borders, saying, you know, worldwide, CNN Every Day has articles, come to America, it's all free, ha ha!
[00:14:48.837 --> 00:14:57.405]  The land of milk and honey, the Golden Valley, the heaven, heaven on earth, Fantasy Island, it's all free, ha ha!
[00:14:57.405 --> 00:14:59.267]  I mean, it is just red level.
[00:14:59.267 --> 00:15:01.189]  The country is melting down.
[00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:02.390]  Yes.
[00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:20.206]  Yeah.
[00:15:36.178 --> 00:15:37.439]  Have any more time.
[00:15:37.439 --> 00:15:39.221]  Our worst fears have been confirmed.
[00:15:39.221 --> 00:15:49.111]  We're dealing with a red-level, hardcore, scientific, global, technocratic, attempted takeover of the United States ahead of the worldwide financial collapse.
[00:15:49.111 --> 00:15:59.061]  And under this new system, Katie, bar the door, they're going to turn loose the giant multi-million person army of snitches, spies, killers, enforcers in a new gun war.
[00:15:59.742 --> 00:16:03.445]  In America, it's not a drug war, a war on the Second Amendment.
[00:16:03.445 --> 00:16:05.806]  David Knight, give us your breakdown on this.
[00:16:05.806 --> 00:16:11.050]  Do you disagree with me that we are entering heart-pounding times?
[00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.251]  This signals they're going for broke.
[00:16:13.251 --> 00:16:15.533]  Again, our worst fears have been confirmed, folks.
[00:16:15.533 --> 00:16:16.213]  Gear up.
[00:16:16.213 --> 00:16:16.954]  This is it.
[00:16:16.954 --> 00:16:20.496]  But we don't need to just gear up for physical confrontation when they come to confiscate the guns.
[00:16:20.496 --> 00:16:27.341]  We have to politically hammer them right now in the streets with signs, you name it, aggressively so they back down.
[00:16:27.341 --> 00:16:29.422]  We've done it before when they ran their sand
[00:16:29.522 --> 00:16:30.186]  Thank you, David.
[00:16:33.433 --> 00:16:34.113]  Absolutely, Alex.
[00:16:34.113 --> 00:16:43.798]  You know, there's a group of pro-lifers who are very upset with John Boehner because he promised that he was going to pass a late-term abortion bill in January.
[00:16:43.798 --> 00:16:45.739]  Of course, he hasn't done that like he hasn't done anything else.
[00:16:45.739 --> 00:16:47.319]  So they're going to Capitol Hill.
[00:16:47.319 --> 00:16:49.180]  They said they're going to sit at his office.
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.081]  They're going to get arrested, whatever.
[00:16:51.081 --> 00:16:53.162]  People need to get upset about these issues.
[00:16:53.162 --> 00:16:55.023]  And of course, that's a key issue.
[00:16:55.023 --> 00:16:58.144]  So is the takedown of the Second Amendment.
[00:16:58.144 --> 00:17:01.786]  My take on this was positive yesterday because
[00:17:02.446 --> 00:17:07.610]  Alex, we see so many different bureaucracies that are trying to expand their territory.
[00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.811]  Look at the FCC going over the internet.
[00:17:09.811 --> 00:17:11.913]  There's power grabbing by different agencies.
[00:17:11.913 --> 00:17:12.453]  Absolutely.
[00:17:12.453 --> 00:17:22.581]  Anthony Gucciardi talked about how the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, is trying to extend its authority over the internet by going through the ad portals, essentially.
[00:17:23.061 --> 00:17:28.426]  And so we see all these organizations, these bureaucracies that exist permanently.
[00:17:28.426 --> 00:17:29.967]  They're not elected by the people.
[00:17:29.967 --> 00:17:31.549]  They're not accountable to the people.
[00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:33.150]  And so we have absolutely no control.
[00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:39.295]  We can have a comment period where we can send them our comments about their proposed legislation.
[00:17:39.295 --> 00:17:40.777]  They don't have to listen to us.
[00:17:40.777 --> 00:17:42.558]  If they don't listen to us, there's nothing we can do.
[00:17:42.558 --> 00:17:44.040]  If you look at what the FCC just did,
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.822]  They just passed this legislation without even having no comment.
[00:17:47.822 --> 00:17:48.562]  Nobody can see it.
[00:17:48.562 --> 00:17:52.444]  Not even the congressmen have seen it a week after they passed this.
[00:17:52.444 --> 00:17:59.287]  So, when I looked at this and said, when he said, let's eliminate the ATF, my first reaction was, absolutely.
[00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:00.888]  That's what I would do if I was there.
[00:18:00.888 --> 00:18:01.948]  I would go on the offensive.
[00:18:01.948 --> 00:18:07.331]  I would say, let's shut down these bureaucracies that have metastasized into their own little separate empires.
[00:18:08.382 --> 00:18:14.828]  I think the only positive thing that would come out of this, he's going to move the functionality, as you pointed out, to the FBI, to the DEA.
[00:18:14.828 --> 00:18:17.431]  It could be more ruthlessly enforced.
[00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:19.933]  And we know, of course, that the FBI has set people up with false flags.
[00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:21.335]  We just talked to Barrett Brown yesterday.
[00:18:22.267 --> 00:18:28.128]  About how the FBI brought all kinds of false charges against him, misconstrued Twitter statements that he'd made.
[00:18:28.128 --> 00:18:31.829]  He said, we no longer have a rule of law, we have a rule of law enforcement.
[00:18:31.829 --> 00:18:33.770]  And of course, that would continue.
[00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:45.753]  But on the other hand, we would get rid of this upper echelon of ATF management that's been responsible for Fast and Furious, that is working with Obama to create a situation where they totally bypass this.
[00:18:45.753 --> 00:18:45.993]  Absolutely.
[00:18:45.993 --> 00:18:48.993]  And neuter Congress and neuter the Second Amendment by going after ammunition.
[00:18:48.993 --> 00:18:51.234]  And Obama has been going after ammunition from
[00:18:51.254 --> 00:18:53.056]  From the very beginning, and that's the sheer play.
[00:19:12.637 --> 00:19:15.061]  People put on a no-fly list to be able to buy guns.
[00:19:15.061 --> 00:19:16.102]  No judge, no jury.
[00:19:16.102 --> 00:19:20.929]  So we're going to this extrajudicial system, whether it's the internet or whether it's borders.
[00:19:21.874 --> 00:19:24.917]  We are moving to a completely dictatorial model.
[00:19:24.917 --> 00:19:29.341]  The good news is Hillary Clinton may not be able to survive what's happening.
[00:19:29.341 --> 00:19:32.063]  The sense is the people are very angry, very upset.
[00:19:32.063 --> 00:19:35.406]  The worm is politically turning, not just here, but all over the world.
[00:19:35.406 --> 00:19:42.032]  But I totally agree with you, David, that this is a very important time for everyone to be aware of what's happening and to get aggressive.
[00:19:42.032 --> 00:19:42.913]  And let's expand on that.
[00:19:43.473 --> 00:19:54.567]  When the Republicans didn't have a majority in the Senate, but they had a smaller majority in the House last year, 2014, they were able to pass a partial birth abortion ban in the House.
[00:19:54.567 --> 00:19:55.569]  The Senate killed it.
[00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:57.611]  Now we have the Senate, have the House.
[00:19:57.611 --> 00:19:58.632]  They have no excuse.
[00:19:59.093 --> 00:20:03.054]  It's no secret that government and big business buy in bulk and get huge discounts.
[00:20:03.054 --> 00:20:04.655]  Not available to the little guy.
[00:20:04.655 --> 00:20:05.815]  Until now.

[00:20:29.579 --> 00:20:30.579]  Hey, Boomer!
[00:20:30.579 --> 00:20:34.020]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.680]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.640]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:43.481]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[00:20:43.481 --> 00:20:44.302]  I know, right?
[00:20:44.302 --> 00:20:45.622]  You love it, too!
[00:20:45.622 --> 00:20:47.062]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[00:20:47.062 --> 00:20:48.082]  Let's go get some!
[00:20:48.082 --> 00:20:49.843]  Get Berkey clean water by calling 877-886-3653.

[00:20:58.544 --> 00:21:01.466]  It's time to kick some ash.
[00:21:01.466 --> 00:21:04.107]  Because cigarettes have met their match.
[00:21:04.107 --> 00:21:06.809]  Smokers are switching to Vapriate e-liquid by Le Cig.
[00:21:06.809 --> 00:21:10.451]  Because when you kick ash, you kick tar and smelly smoke, too.
[00:21:10.451 --> 00:21:14.173]  Le Cig smokes the competition with real people customer service.

[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.821]  Kick some ash.
[00:21:28.123 --> 00:21:29.604]  Attention Alex Jones listeners.

[00:21:58.363 --> 00:22:07.957]  As the New World Order continues to tighten its grip on every facet of our lives, we're all asking ourselves, how can we maintain our independence?
[00:22:07.957 --> 00:22:09.519]  The answer is clear.
[00:22:09.519 --> 00:22:12.122]  Get prepared and you get prepared now.
[00:22:12.122 --> 00:22:14.666]  Now the only question left is where do we begin?
[00:22:15.567 --> 00:22:17.809]  My Patriot Supply is here to help.
[00:22:17.809 --> 00:22:24.694]  Call 800-247-3070 to get started with your 72-hour emergency food supply for only $10.
[00:22:24.694 --> 00:22:28.156]  We're even covering the cost of shipping.
[00:22:28.156 --> 00:22:32.379]  Are you willing to rely on the government and FEMA in the event of an emergency?
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:41.287]  Call 800-274-3070 to get started with your 72-hour emergency food supply for only $10!
[00:22:41.287 --> 00:22:46.952]  You won't be able to find this deal online, and there is a strict limit of 4 per caller, so don't wait!
[00:22:46.952 --> 00:22:47.612]  Call now!
[00:22:47.612 --> 00:22:47.673]  800-274-3070.
[00:22:47.673 --> 00:22:48.053]  That's 800-274-3070.
[00:22:48.053 --> 00:22:48.453]  Call right now!
[00:22:57.799 --> 00:23:04.540]  Usually, the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:08.941]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[00:23:08.941 --> 00:23:12.442]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[00:23:12.442 --> 00:23:13.582]  Not fun!
[00:23:13.582 --> 00:23:21.964]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[00:23:21.964 --> 00:23:26.725]  One World Whey is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[00:23:27.065 --> 00:23:28.226]  My name is Errol.
[00:23:28.226 --> 00:23:29.767]  I'm 74 years old.
[00:23:29.767 --> 00:23:32.328]  You know, the taste of One World Whey is amazing.
[00:23:32.328 --> 00:23:40.193]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your trace mineral supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[00:23:40.193 --> 00:23:46.497]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.
[00:23:46.497 --> 00:23:46.977]  Call 888-988-3325.
[00:23:46.977 --> 00:23:47.177]  That's 888-988-3325.
[00:23:47.177 --> 00:23:48.258]  Or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[00:24:09.802 --> 00:24:23.506]  I'm Alex Jones coming to you from the road.
[00:24:23.506 --> 00:24:30.908]  We've got David Knight, InfoWars Natalie News anchor, co-hosting the broadcast with us from Austin, Texas.
[00:24:30.908 --> 00:24:34.729]  And I'm really glad that David brought up
[00:24:35.925 --> 00:24:49.184]  In conjunction with this whole Second Amendment story, this whole Second Amendment move, I mean it's really happening, that at the same time the Republicans had the votes in the House and Senate.
[00:24:50.293 --> 00:24:53.615]  And could have banned partial birth abortion, but didn't do it.
[00:24:53.615 --> 00:24:55.395]  They could repeal Obamacare.
[00:24:55.395 --> 00:24:57.236]  They won't even change any of it.
[00:24:57.236 --> 00:24:58.537]  They could control our borders.
[00:24:58.537 --> 00:24:59.337]  They won't do it.
[00:24:59.337 --> 00:25:08.802]  Last week, they sent Obama, during Netanyahu's speech, an admitted distraction now, the blank check to just do whatever he wants with Homeland Security, no strings attached.
[00:25:08.802 --> 00:25:11.323]  Because Congress passes the money and says what it's for.
[00:25:11.323 --> 00:25:12.423]  They just said, you know what?
[00:25:12.423 --> 00:25:13.464]  Here's a blank check, baby.
[00:25:14.778 --> 00:25:16.580]  Here's over a hundred billion dollars.
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:18.843]  Just do whatever you want, have fun.
[00:25:18.843 --> 00:25:20.766]  It's all yours.
[00:25:20.766 --> 00:25:23.290]  It's all yours, bounty hunter.
[00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:26.094]  We are just being thrown down the trash can here.
[00:25:27.008 --> 00:25:34.213]  We are being looted seven ways to Sunday, just like China for over a hundred years by the Western powers was before the Boxer Rebellion.
[00:25:34.213 --> 00:25:38.416]  Look it up, and they use drugs shipped in by British intelligence to bring down China.
[00:25:38.416 --> 00:25:41.939]  It's the same story to divide and conquer the country.
[00:25:41.939 --> 00:25:47.643]  And for all of you out there that are part of the system, when it's all said and done, you're going to have your wealth looted as well.
[00:25:47.643 --> 00:25:49.444]  This is extremely predatory.
[00:25:49.444 --> 00:25:51.725]  It's going to basically the bottom
[00:25:52.606 --> 00:25:53.688]  And it's got to be reversed.
[00:25:53.688 --> 00:25:58.638]  So again, I ask the listeners, we're going to open the phones up coming up in the next segment.
[00:25:59.873 --> 00:26:07.778]  I ask the listeners, what do we do to point out that, A, even if Congress passed an ammo ban, it would be unconstitutional.
[00:26:07.778 --> 00:26:09.679]  This isn't even a law.
[00:26:09.679 --> 00:26:11.480]  This isn't even about the Second Amendment now.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:21.747]  It's about dictatorship of the executive branch and these bureaucracies that literally are run by a bunch of corporate chiefs in revolving doors.
[00:26:21.747 --> 00:26:23.428]  The former head of Monsanto.
[00:26:24.537 --> 00:26:25.277]  I don't know.
[00:26:47.702 --> 00:26:53.324]  This is how we've been completely sold out, and now they're coming for the Second Amendment.
[00:26:53.324 --> 00:26:54.745]  Folks, that's what I keep saying.
[00:26:54.745 --> 00:27:07.650]  If they get away with dictatorial actions at a level never before seen, and even mainstream media and members of Congress say Obama is acting like a dictator, the bigger issue is why is Congress green-lighting everything and just handing him the tacit power?
[00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:10.571]  David Knight, the toll-free number for listeners to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:27:14.412 --> 00:27:15.132]  Are you angry?
[00:27:15.132 --> 00:27:15.832]  Are you focused?
[00:27:15.832 --> 00:27:17.793]  Do you understand this is make it or break it?
[00:27:17.793 --> 00:27:21.974]  We're entering a major sector where the globalists are probing and moving on every front.
[00:27:21.974 --> 00:27:23.495]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[00:27:23.495 --> 00:27:24.515]  800-259-9231.
[00:27:24.515 --> 00:27:29.416]  What about the pro-lifers, David?
[00:27:29.416 --> 00:27:31.137]  I mean, they've got the right idea.
[00:27:31.137 --> 00:27:33.697]  Everywhere Boehner goes, he should be besieged.
[00:27:33.697 --> 00:27:36.918]  He's going to allow the continued murder of all these children.
[00:27:36.918 --> 00:27:40.859]  People have to get angry enough, Alex, where they stand up and they do something.
[00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:42.740]  And that's why when I looked at this initially,
[00:27:44.316 --> 00:27:48.361]  I'm so concerned about the passivity of Congress, and this is something that's been going on for decades.
[00:27:48.361 --> 00:27:56.311]  They have been turning over their legislative function to these bureaucracies that they've created, like the ATF, like the FDA, whatever.
[00:27:56.311 --> 00:28:01.077]  Every one of these bureaucracies, the EPA, going after wood stoves, as we talked about yesterday.
[00:28:01.758 --> 00:28:07.181]  They just keep expanding their reach into our lives without any reason.
[00:28:07.181 --> 00:28:09.603]  And they're little governments unto themselves.
[00:28:09.603 --> 00:28:14.365]  They write the laws, they legislate, they enforce the laws, they have their own courts.
[00:28:14.365 --> 00:28:22.610]  And so when I saw somebody in Congress saying, let's go on the offensive, let's take down one of these, that would be a lesson to all of the agencies.
[00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:24.631]  So from that standpoint, I think it's a good thing.
[00:28:24.631 --> 00:28:27.533]  Now, of course, the government is still going to be coming after the Second Amendment.
[00:28:27.533 --> 00:28:29.334]  It would be different agencies that would be coming after it.
[00:28:29.674 --> 00:28:35.977]  One of the things, Alex, that I thought was interesting, I think they're losing the hearts and minds of the people, certainly, on the war on drugs.
[00:28:35.977 --> 00:28:38.198]  We've seen this over and over again, state after state.
[00:28:38.198 --> 00:28:40.039]  That's a government shift to the Second Amendment.
[00:28:40.039 --> 00:28:41.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:48.864]  And so, if they were to take the alcohol and tobacco to the DEA, that would be one way to kind of placate that powerful bureaucracy
[00:28:49.304 --> 00:28:52.506]  Which, in and of itself, is like its own separate government.
[00:28:52.506 --> 00:28:56.729]  That'd be kind of way too... The DEA will now be involved in alcohol and tobacco?
[00:28:56.729 --> 00:29:01.873]  I mean, Joe Biggs used to deliver people to be tortured in Afghanistan to the DEA.
[00:29:01.873 --> 00:29:12.080]  The DEA is one of the scariest, most clandestine operative groups out there, but nobody thinks of it as sexy like the Navy SEALs or the CIA, because the DEA is smart enough to stay below the radar.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.103]  I mean, they are super wicked, super badasses.
[00:29:15.799 --> 00:29:18.405]  I mean, they bring in the narcotics, folks.
[00:29:18.405 --> 00:29:19.788]  Yeah, you talk about Fast and Furious.
[00:29:19.788 --> 00:29:25.641]  I mean, everything that the DEA has been doing for decades has been an entire Fast and Furious operation, running both sides of it.
[00:29:27.421 --> 00:29:27.921]  Absolutely.
[00:29:27.921 --> 00:29:31.863]  I mean, I shake to think of the DEA over the Second Amendment.
[00:29:31.863 --> 00:29:36.645]  So, I mean, we're talking about a lower, small, two-inch demon right now, the ATF, that everybody hates.
[00:29:36.645 --> 00:29:44.048]  They've been hated since they were the revenuers, you know, 150 years ago, going after moonshiners, to a gorilla that weighs 600 pounds.
[00:29:44.048 --> 00:29:48.410]  I mean, we're talking about a 600-pound gorilla of the DEA.
[00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:49.811]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.811 --> 00:29:52.332]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.332 --> 00:29:55.013]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:18.805]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy-Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:30:18.805 --> 00:30:21.726]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[00:30:21.926 --> 00:30:22.427]  I don't know.
[00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:48.993]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[00:32:32.633 --> 00:32:36.915]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:32:36.915 --> 00:32:38.696]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:32:38.696 --> 00:32:44.019]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[00:32:44.019 --> 00:32:46.540]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:47.701]  But for how long?
[00:32:47.701 --> 00:32:49.902]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[00:32:49.902 --> 00:32:54.324]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:32:54.324 --> 00:32:56.205]  Infidel Body Armor.
[00:32:56.205 --> 00:32:57.146]  Just won't quit.
[00:33:01.781 --> 00:33:08.415]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:33:08.415 --> 00:33:11.401]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:13.766 --> 00:33:15.286]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:15.286 --> 00:33:17.967]  I'm David Knight and we have Alex Jones joining us.
[00:33:17.967 --> 00:33:19.627]  We've been talking about the Second Amendment.
[00:33:19.627 --> 00:33:20.888]  That's going to be our focus today.
[00:33:20.888 --> 00:33:30.310]  We also, in other news, we see that the CDC is back at the Tulane Bioweapons Lab trying to find out how this got out of the lab.
[00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:33.931]  These are gain-of-function experiments trying to weaponize bacteria.
[00:33:34.651 --> 00:33:40.714]  We have our federal government weaponizing their powers and that's what we're talking about with the Second Amendment.
[00:33:40.714 --> 00:33:47.938]  How did we get these clueless people who are weaponizing and adding function to their powers?
[00:33:47.938 --> 00:33:49.419]  How do we bring them in?
[00:33:49.419 --> 00:33:52.021]  Is the way we do it with a ban on the ATF?
[00:33:52.021 --> 00:33:56.943]  Do we disassemble the ATF and move its responsibilities to the FBI and the DEA?
[00:33:56.943 --> 00:33:59.285]  How do we move back as a people?
[00:33:59.285 --> 00:34:00.765]  Certainly Congress is not going to do it.
[00:34:00.765 --> 00:34:01.506]  What do you think, Alex?
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:09.246]  Well, David, we have to have a national debate about what it is to be a free country versus a tyranny.
[00:34:09.246 --> 00:34:16.133]  And we have to admit to ourselves that we have fallen as a nation the minute that we rationalized killing babies in the womb.
[00:34:17.625 --> 00:34:19.327]  Then old people were going to be worthless.
[00:34:19.327 --> 00:34:21.370]  The veterans were going to be worthless.
[00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:22.831]  The troops were going to be worthless.
[00:34:22.831 --> 00:34:23.953]  Our women would be worthless.
[00:34:23.953 --> 00:34:25.174]  Our men would be worthless.
[00:34:25.174 --> 00:34:26.275]  Our children would be worthless.
[00:34:26.275 --> 00:34:37.969]  We have been chopping our children up and throwing them in trash cans and now using them for Pepsi flavoring and now using them for vaccine flesh production stock for so long that
[00:34:39.375 --> 00:34:44.597]  Now, so what if we've got 1 in 56 with autism from 1 in 25,000 30 years ago?
[00:34:44.597 --> 00:34:47.498]  So what if breast cancer is up 3,000%?
[00:34:47.498 --> 00:34:59.982]  So what if it comes out in big British government studies confirming the Harvard studies that fluoride makes you fat, unhappy, and very depressed, and makes your thyroid fail and your pancreas fail?
[00:34:59.982 --> 00:35:00.823]  So what?
[00:35:00.823 --> 00:35:06.545]  I mean, it's just an attitude of where we've been conditioned and have adapted by having our will broken.
[00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:10.053]  To just accept anything.
[00:35:10.053 --> 00:35:18.168]  And now we've seen the power grabs going on for a long time after Kennedy right through to President Obama.
[00:35:19.247 --> 00:35:19.327]  And
[00:35:41.431 --> 00:35:50.298]  Undoubtedly this show, within minutes of a federal building going up in a mushroom cloud, my face will be on national television and they will say it's all my fault.
[00:35:50.298 --> 00:35:53.941]  That's why we're here every day exposing that it's not our fault.
[00:35:53.941 --> 00:35:55.122]  We're trying to stop it.
[00:35:55.122 --> 00:35:56.483]  We understand the enemy operation.
[00:35:57.364 --> 00:35:59.125]  They're going to blame Drudge Report.
[00:35:59.125 --> 00:36:01.065]  They're going to blame Rush Limbaugh.
[00:36:01.065 --> 00:36:03.806]  They're going to blame any media they don't control.
[00:36:03.806 --> 00:36:06.367]  Doesn't mean Drudge is perfect.
[00:36:06.367 --> 00:36:07.427]  Doesn't mean I'm perfect.
[00:36:07.427 --> 00:36:08.868]  Doesn't mean Limbaugh's perfect.
[00:36:08.868 --> 00:36:11.588]  It just means we've supported the Second Amendment.
[00:36:11.588 --> 00:36:12.889]  We've been pro-life.
[00:36:12.889 --> 00:36:14.589]  We've been against collectivism.
[00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:17.850]  We have to be silenced, discredited, destroyed.
[00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:19.391]  And WorldNetDaily's the same.
[00:36:19.391 --> 00:36:20.791]  TalkRadio's the same.
[00:36:20.791 --> 00:36:22.812]  That's what the FCC takeover of the web is about.
[00:36:23.874 --> 00:36:24.695]  This is it.
[00:36:24.695 --> 00:36:29.120]  I mean, every instinct I've got is to haul anchor and get out of this country.
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:33.204]  My flesh, my flesh wants to flee to the South Pacific.
[00:36:33.204 --> 00:36:36.207]  My flesh wants to flee to New Zealand.
[00:36:36.207 --> 00:36:38.750]  My flesh wants to flee to Chile.
[00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:44.737]  And, you know, just get some cottage up in the mountains in a low crime area and get to know the locals and hope everybody's nice, you know, and go local.
[00:36:45.916 --> 00:36:47.858]  That's what my flesh wants to do.
[00:36:47.858 --> 00:36:55.526]  But see, it's the spirit that's going to defeat this evil, and my spirit says you're going to stay here, and you're going to fight this, and you're going to go on to the end, whatever the cost may be.
[00:36:55.526 --> 00:36:58.389]  And what we've done as a culture and a society is we've gone with our flesh.
[00:36:58.389 --> 00:36:59.971]  I don't want to have a baby with this woman.
[00:36:59.971 --> 00:37:00.952]  I'm just going to pay for an abortion.
[00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:02.113]  It's not really a human.
[00:37:02.113 --> 00:37:03.194]  And then they give you a rationale.
[00:37:04.099 --> 00:37:07.441]  And then, oh, I'm not going to worry about my grandparents or my parents.
[00:37:07.441 --> 00:37:11.463]  I'm just going to stick them in the facility, and so what if they euthanize them basically with morphine?
[00:37:11.463 --> 00:37:13.243]  You know, they've had a good life and whatever.
[00:37:13.243 --> 00:37:14.444]  And oh, you know what?
[00:37:14.444 --> 00:37:15.465]  I've got a handicapped kid.
[00:37:15.465 --> 00:37:17.505]  Let's go ahead and kill them up to age five.
[00:37:17.505 --> 00:37:23.028]  Now, the mainline liberal publications are calling for killing children up to age five, or even if you just don't like how your kid looks.
[00:37:23.028 --> 00:37:24.569]  And oh, let's have designer babies.
[00:37:24.569 --> 00:37:30.592]  And oh, oh, oh, oh, let's take children from parents to give them to, quote, gay families
[00:37:31.312 --> 00:37:36.274]  But then let's not let people that own guns and have no criminal record in Nevada adopt a child.
[00:37:36.274 --> 00:37:38.334]  You see, it's discriminatory.
[00:37:38.334 --> 00:37:48.857]  They come in and they claim they're here to empower and they play off our bleeding hearts, who are true classical liberals at heart, in a Jeffersonian way, to go, yeah, you're right.
[00:37:48.857 --> 00:37:51.558]  Let's pay for the immigrants to come have their babies here.
[00:37:51.558 --> 00:37:52.318]  Yeah, you're right.
[00:37:52.318 --> 00:37:56.179]  Let's turn our guns in so children don't get hurt anymore.
[00:37:56.179 --> 00:37:57.380]  It's all about guilting us.
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.041]  We're good to go.
[00:38:20.837 --> 00:38:23.159]  And David can see the callers on screen.
[00:38:23.159 --> 00:38:24.921]  He can call those out and go to those as well.
[00:38:24.921 --> 00:38:26.122]  In fact, I've now got the call screen.
[00:38:26.122 --> 00:38:26.442]  Thank you.
[00:38:26.442 --> 00:38:28.825]  I haven't gone on the road in a while, so I'm working out some of the bugs.
[00:38:28.825 --> 00:38:30.987]  The crew's doing a great job.
[00:38:30.987 --> 00:38:36.192]  Look at this headline on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that dovetails everything we're talking about.
[00:38:36.192 --> 00:38:40.015]  And within this is a microcosm to see the mind control.
[00:38:41.056 --> 00:38:50.465]  South Carolina National Guard conducts door-to-door wellness checks, gun confiscation exercises, troops unknowingly trained for martial law.
[00:38:50.465 --> 00:38:51.907]  Excellent article.
[00:38:51.907 --> 00:38:55.951]  And it goes into the breakdown of the entire situation.
[00:38:55.951 --> 00:39:01.236]  I think we probably should play this report coming up that Rob Duce shot about it.
[00:39:01.236 --> 00:39:04.659]  Operation Vigilant Guardian, which we exposed five years ago,
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:19.553]  As an exercise to set up gun confiscations and in turn citizens is being run across the country under the guise of helping citizens, even though we've seen National Guard go door to door.
[00:39:19.553 --> 00:39:23.156]  And the video report that needs to go viral breaks it down.
[00:39:23.156 --> 00:39:27.160]  See, they tried this five years ago and it was even in local newspapers, we covered it.
[00:39:29.634 --> 00:39:35.139]  To have them drill to quote in Arcadia, Iowa and places to take the guns, to confiscate the firearms.
[00:39:35.139 --> 00:39:36.820]  We had colonels on who admitted it.
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:38.562]  It was a big national story.
[00:39:38.562 --> 00:39:39.823]  So then that backfired.
[00:39:39.823 --> 00:39:41.905]  So now they're calling it wellness checks.
[00:39:41.905 --> 00:39:47.731]  So the troops themselves are just being trained to go door to door and ask social worker questions and put it in a database.
[00:39:48.331 --> 00:39:50.434]  They're not bad people.
[00:39:50.434 --> 00:39:56.701]  They're being put in a bad position so they're the loving good face that people trust.
[00:39:56.701 --> 00:40:04.811]  There's a higher approval rating for National Guard and military than there is for any other government agency or group, so they want to use them as their front.
[00:40:05.231 --> 00:40:05.831]  We're good to go.
[00:40:27.499 --> 00:40:31.922]  I'm concerned that we're not, InfoWars isn't taking this as seriously as we should.
[00:40:31.922 --> 00:40:33.022]  That I'm not.
[00:40:33.022 --> 00:40:55.878]  That I've been too long close to tyranny fighting it, that I've almost become comfortable with it, and pretty much just expect all this evil to come, when I forget all the animating contest of liberty that we've been in, where we've had victory and held the enemy back for so long, that's why they're forced to reveal themselves now, as you said earlier, show their cards, in a desperate brazen braggand power grab,
[00:40:56.198 --> 00:41:09.887]  That if we actually stand up against maybe their downfall and give us a reprieve of a decade or a hundred years, just as Nineveh was given a reprieve, as in the old, so as in the new, this is what we're looking at.
[00:41:09.887 --> 00:41:13.130]  I just don't want to decide that we're going to submit to this.
[00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:21.976]  Obviously we're not, but I don't want us at a gut spiritual level to feel like we're on a fool's errand and are just doing this because justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[00:41:21.976 --> 00:41:23.017]  That's not what we're doing.
[00:41:23.857 --> 00:41:30.221]  Yes, at one level we are, but greater than that is that we will have victory if we simply demand it and take it.
[00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:31.422]  That's God's promise.
[00:41:31.422 --> 00:41:35.365]  But we have to stand up against the enemy when they come in.
[00:41:35.365 --> 00:41:40.588]  David, I mean, I'm ranting here, but this is just over the top to actually see all of this unfold.
[00:41:40.588 --> 00:41:45.471]  The power grabbing of one month dwarfs what I've seen the last 10 years, David.
[00:41:45.471 --> 00:41:47.333]  What are we going to see in the next month, David?
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.642]  I don't know, Alex, but what you said is exactly right.
[00:41:50.642 --> 00:41:52.062]  People have to stand up.
[00:41:52.062 --> 00:41:58.006]  That's what's right about these people going to Boehner's office and saying, you said you were going to do this, you didn't do it.
[00:41:58.006 --> 00:42:03.490]  And of course, the larger picture is they've taken an oath to the Constitution and they're walking that back.
[00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:09.915]  What you're saying, for people to stand up and peacefully demand their rights, is what we saw at the Bundy Ranch.
[00:42:09.915 --> 00:42:11.517]  That was very encouraging.
[00:42:11.517 --> 00:42:16.702]  I saw the Second Amendment exercised in the way that the founders meant for it to be exercised.
[00:42:16.702 --> 00:42:21.847]  And that is, as a deterrence to criminal actions by the government.
[00:42:21.847 --> 00:42:26.011]  The government had come in there, they had confiscated its cattle, but more importantly, they had
[00:42:26.651 --> 00:42:27.752]  Uh, attack people.
[00:42:27.752 --> 00:42:30.794]  They had set up signs that said this is a First Amendment area.
[00:42:30.794 --> 00:42:34.257]  The people in that area were sick of the abuse.
[00:42:34.257 --> 00:42:37.119]  They put on their weapons and they stood them down.
[00:42:37.119 --> 00:42:39.581]  No violence happened, but they did it peacefully.
[00:42:39.581 --> 00:42:41.583]  It sent shockwaves through the power structure.
[00:42:42.223 --> 00:42:49.888]  When you guys stood up to them and they had to back down and let them know that we're not going to be bullied forever and at a certain point we're not going to back down.
[00:42:49.888 --> 00:42:52.409]  Do they really want the next Lexington or Concord?
[00:42:52.409 --> 00:42:56.452]  Do the globalists who are barely hanging on right now really want this civil war?
[00:42:56.452 --> 00:43:00.374]  Because when they blow stuff up to demonize us, it ain't going to work this time.
[00:43:00.374 --> 00:43:03.476]  The police and military know what's going on now.
[00:43:03.476 --> 00:43:04.557]  It ain't going to work.
[00:43:04.557 --> 00:43:06.238]  The dog ain't going to hunt, David.
[00:43:06.718 --> 00:43:10.179]  I don't think that the Senate has our back on this like anything else, Alex.
[00:43:10.179 --> 00:43:14.780]  This letter from the 52 Senators, they talk about what the ATF calls as framework.
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:21.342]  Quote, an ATF framework for determining whether certain projectiles are primarily intended for sporting purposes.
[00:43:21.342 --> 00:43:23.123]  That's what the ATF is putting out there.
[00:43:23.743 --> 00:43:31.672]  And they're saying that we're going to determine, the ATF is going to determine, whether or not the ammunition is intended primarily for sporting purposes.
[00:43:31.672 --> 00:43:34.956]  And the Senate is saying, you don't have the right to make that determination.
[00:43:34.956 --> 00:43:38.200]  But what they're not talking about, Alex, is the elephant in the room.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:41.563]  The fact that the Second Amendment is not about sporting.
[00:43:41.563 --> 00:43:42.504]  It's not about hunting.
[00:43:42.504 --> 00:43:43.886]  It's not about target shooting.
[00:43:43.886 --> 00:43:44.547]  It's about
[00:43:45.027 --> 00:43:50.889]  A check on the power of government, and that check can be done peacefully, just as we saw during the Cold War.
[00:43:50.889 --> 00:43:55.391]  We had a stand-down, a mutual assured destruction, and that can be done peacefully.
[00:43:55.391 --> 00:43:56.771]  That's why we have the Second Amendment.
[00:43:56.771 --> 00:43:58.132]  It's not for hunting and transporting.
[00:43:58.132 --> 00:43:58.452]  Absolutely.
[00:43:58.452 --> 00:44:01.513]  The collectivists are trying to gut the country right now because they're losing.
[00:44:01.513 --> 00:44:03.213]  They know the country's waking up.
[00:44:03.213 --> 00:44:08.275]  They're scared, ladies and gentlemen, but they want to try to bully us now into submission.
[00:44:08.275 --> 00:44:09.515]  It cannot happen.
[00:44:09.515 --> 00:44:14.077]  In fact, later, at the bottom of the next hour, we ought to air the audio and the video of that epic
[00:44:14.697 --> 00:44:16.840]  I'm sure it was something about the Bundy Ranch standoff.
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.123]  It's got about 1.3 million views on it by now.
[00:44:32.967 --> 00:44:36.028]  I think it's Fed surrender to Citizens Bundy Ranch.
[00:44:36.028 --> 00:44:37.789]  Put that on screen for folks.
[00:44:37.789 --> 00:44:39.549]  We should have articles about that and explain.
[00:44:39.549 --> 00:44:40.970]  This is the blueprint.
[00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:49.252]  Not so much with an armed standoff, but the fact that when they did pull the guns and say we're going to shoot you, that's when the people wrote across and said go ahead and do it.
[00:44:49.252 --> 00:44:49.692]  There it is.
[00:44:49.692 --> 00:44:50.273]  Historic.
[00:44:50.273 --> 00:44:53.013]  Fed forces surrender to the American citizens.
[00:44:53.013 --> 00:44:55.974]  That sent shockwaves through the globalists.
[00:44:55.974 --> 00:44:59.976]  Harry Reid and others shook with fear and said this cannot be allowed to stand.
[00:45:00.876 --> 00:45:02.096]  There will be repercussions.
[00:45:02.096 --> 00:45:04.077]  What, you're going to start a bigger war?
[00:45:04.077 --> 00:45:06.498]  Don't you people get it that we're not afraid?
[00:45:06.498 --> 00:45:14.660]  We just have tried to fix things peacefully, and we don't want to have a needless civil war with the police and the military, as their rights are being destroyed too, and their citizens as well.
[00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:15.540]  Don't you understand?
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:16.921]  World government's real.
[00:45:16.921 --> 00:45:18.801]  America really has been captured.
[00:45:18.801 --> 00:45:23.322]  You're living in an epic time, folks, like a movie, like we're the French Resistance.
[00:45:23.322 --> 00:45:25.243]  This isn't a game, people.
[00:45:25.243 --> 00:45:26.463]  We are occupied.
[00:45:26.463 --> 00:45:28.104]  The globalists have seized control.
[00:45:28.104 --> 00:45:28.704]  It's real.
[00:45:29.184 --> 00:45:34.533]  There really is baby flavoring used with dead babies for Pepsi.
[00:45:34.533 --> 00:45:37.337]  There really are dead babies in the vaccines.
[00:45:37.337 --> 00:45:38.078]  You understand?
[00:45:38.078 --> 00:45:40.262]  I mean, it's all over the top, people.
[00:45:40.262 --> 00:45:41.003]  They really do heat.
[00:45:42.102 --> 00:45:46.846]  Hospitals in Oregon and in London, all over the world with dead babies.
[00:45:46.846 --> 00:45:48.508]  I mean, the globalists are evil.
[00:45:48.508 --> 00:45:49.129]  Do you understand?
[00:45:49.129 --> 00:45:50.069]  It isn't a game.
[00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.830]  We were right.
[00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:52.051]  It's all happening.
[00:45:52.051 --> 00:45:53.753]  And we're not happy about being right.
[00:45:53.753 --> 00:45:54.333]  Dammit!
[00:45:54.333 --> 00:45:55.835]  Excuse me, I apologize.
[00:45:55.835 --> 00:45:58.077]  But this is not a game, people!
[00:45:58.077 --> 00:45:59.378]  It's not a game!
[00:45:59.378 --> 00:46:00.339]  Do you understand?
[00:46:00.339 --> 00:46:01.100]  They're coming!
[00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:01.800]  They're killing us!
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.081]  They put in the vaccines!
[00:46:03.081 --> 00:46:04.643]  People are dying everywhere!
[00:46:04.643 --> 00:46:06.485]  They're murdering us with soft kill weapons!
[00:46:07.947 --> 00:46:09.910]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:11.353]  We probably need to go to some phone calls, Dave.
[00:46:11.353 --> 00:46:14.598]  In fact, let's just go ahead and go to some phone calls.
[00:46:14.598 --> 00:46:17.082]  Let's go to Greg in New Mexico.
[00:46:17.082 --> 00:46:18.124]  Or Craig in New Mexico.
[00:46:18.124 --> 00:46:18.925]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:46:19.963 --> 00:46:21.544]  Hello, first time caller.
[00:46:21.544 --> 00:46:25.768]  I've been listening to you guys for years and years and I couldn't agree with you more.
[00:46:25.768 --> 00:46:36.958]  What I'm looking at is, on the Second Amendment, them going after the ammunition, is what they're most likely going to do, and this is from what I've been noticing, is a false flag.
[00:46:36.958 --> 00:46:42.103]  And then they're going to go with John Kerry signed the United Nations Small Arms Treaty.
[00:46:42.683 --> 00:46:52.686]  And what they will do, is what it looks like, is they will say, since we're on this small arms treaty, we want to ban any imported ammunition coming into the country.
[00:46:52.686 --> 00:47:07.231]  And if you think about it, what that'll immediately do is you'd have everybody with AK-47s, AK-74s, anything that comes from out of the country, which is a good majority of the ammunition that's produced, immediately takes that out of the public.
[00:47:07.651 --> 00:47:10.874]  And then they can have a war on the gun owners and let's go back.
[00:47:10.874 --> 00:47:12.335]  And then next they'll ban having it.
[00:47:12.335 --> 00:47:13.356]  You're absolutely right.
[00:47:13.356 --> 00:47:14.878]  And the dominoes will fall quickly.
[00:47:14.878 --> 00:47:17.260]  Remember, what's the war on guns been the whole time?
[00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:27.109]  It's been the war on ammo with the feds buying every caliber known in existence, basically, by the billions to create a massive increase in prices.
[00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:33.534]  They've done everything they can, like it's a military operation, to degrade our capacity to uphold the Second Amendment.
[00:47:33.534 --> 00:47:34.035]  Go ahead, Collar.
[00:47:35.163 --> 00:47:35.984]  Exactly, Alex.
[00:47:35.984 --> 00:47:42.634]  And now when you look at them going after the ammunition again, you now watch prices skyrocketing for the ammunition.
[00:47:42.634 --> 00:47:45.017]  Now you're seeing shells being picked clean again.
[00:47:45.017 --> 00:47:51.166]  And every time you start seeing where there's a surplus of ammunition, there's something that goes on and they try to take it away.
[00:47:52.427 --> 00:47:54.809]  Think about all the people that have those rifles.
[00:47:54.809 --> 00:48:02.036]  As soon as, if they have the stockpiled ammunition, as soon as that happens, they no longer have access to any ammunition.
[00:48:02.036 --> 00:48:05.038]  And I'm also been a big person for the Second Amendment.
[00:48:05.038 --> 00:48:06.420]  I'm also a veteran.
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:07.901]  I'm an oath keeper.
[00:48:07.901 --> 00:48:08.702]  And I also
[00:48:09.182 --> 00:48:10.983]  I thought about this a year ago.
[00:48:10.983 --> 00:48:17.947]  When they went after the 5.45 by 3.9 round, immediately you saw the prices jump on those.
[00:48:17.947 --> 00:48:20.588]  You saw rounds just nobody could get them any longer.
[00:48:20.588 --> 00:48:22.109]  You couldn't buy them online.
[00:48:22.109 --> 00:48:29.713]  Now when there's no longer surplus, it now has to be modern manufactured for them to be able to use it.
[00:48:29.713 --> 00:48:30.613]  That's right.
[00:48:30.613 --> 00:48:33.255]  Everything is about curtailing the Second Amendment.
[00:48:33.255 --> 00:48:37.157]  And understand folks, we have literal foreign enemies in control of the government.
[00:48:37.797 --> 00:48:39.058]  Trying to disarm the people.
[00:48:39.058 --> 00:48:43.022]  The Republican leadership is scared to death, bullied into submission.
[00:48:43.022 --> 00:48:52.931]  And if you wanted to bring America down, they're shutting our energy off, opening our borders, driving down wages, putting regulations, raising taxes, executive tax raising Obama has now announced.
[00:48:52.931 --> 00:48:53.872]  It's on.
[00:48:53.872 --> 00:49:01.559]  If you wanted to really bring the country down, which the globalists want to do at some point, you would cause a civil war, which will effectively bring the entire country down.
[00:49:02.159 --> 00:49:03.199]  And we'll kill millions.
[00:49:03.199 --> 00:49:18.322]  And I just keep hammering that because the plan is civil war, painting conservatives and libertarians and veterans as the enemy, with the government and its giant third world hordes dumbed down, believing the government loves them, as the new constabulary.
[00:49:18.322 --> 00:49:20.623]  I mean, can you imagine a more hellish thing?
[00:49:20.623 --> 00:49:22.083]  This is their plan.
[00:49:22.083 --> 00:49:23.904]  I ask you, this is not rhetoric.
[00:49:23.904 --> 00:49:24.844]  I mean what I'm saying.
[00:49:24.844 --> 00:49:25.284]  It's real.
[00:49:26.548 --> 00:49:29.289]  Is this not just over-the-top bizarro land?
[00:49:29.289 --> 00:49:31.831]  I mean, are we really going to let this happen?
[00:49:31.831 --> 00:49:37.574]  Is the FBI and the CIA and the Joint Chiefs and everybody else, you're really going to do this?
[00:49:37.574 --> 00:49:39.475]  I mean, you're really going to kill the country?
[00:49:39.475 --> 00:49:40.895]  You're really that nuts?
[00:49:40.895 --> 00:49:50.380]  You really go along with the globalists that hate freedom and hate liberty and hate free market and hate fathers so much that you want to break this country completely in multiple pieces?
[00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:51.661]  Because I'm going to tell you something.
[00:49:51.661 --> 00:49:55.063]  There is no way you're ever going to get away with this from your own masters.
[00:49:55.683 --> 00:49:56.883]  You understand, you're on masters.
[00:49:56.883 --> 00:49:58.864]  Once they've taken over, you've studied history, you know that.
[00:49:58.864 --> 00:50:01.265]  The number one rule is burn every one of you traitors.
[00:50:01.265 --> 00:50:03.346]  They're not going to leave you.
[00:50:03.346 --> 00:50:04.446]  We're going to break in one minute.
[00:50:04.446 --> 00:50:06.427]  Caller, any other points?
[00:50:06.427 --> 00:50:09.368]  Okay, can I make one more comment before I let somebody in there?
[00:50:10.246 --> 00:50:13.770]  I came up with it with something to circumvent what they're doing.
[00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:17.914]  If you look at the ammunition that's coming in from outside the country, it's all Berdan primer.
[00:50:17.914 --> 00:50:19.936]  I don't know if you're familiar with Berdan primers.
[00:50:19.936 --> 00:50:21.938]  It's all steel-cased ammunition.
[00:50:21.938 --> 00:50:25.661]  You can't get brass to reload for those cartridges.
[00:50:25.661 --> 00:50:29.745]  It's nearly impossible to find, especially in a crisis situation.
[00:50:29.745 --> 00:50:33.489]  So even if people wanted to reload those cartridges, they couldn't do it.
[00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:39.571]  I actually came up and I patented a system that now you can reload your steel cartridges.
[00:50:39.571 --> 00:50:42.813]  What's the name of the system?
[00:50:42.813 --> 00:50:49.056]  RussianReloads.com and I sell a kit that you can convert your steel cartridges to reload.
[00:50:49.056 --> 00:50:50.516]  We're out of time.
[00:50:50.516 --> 00:50:53.818]  We're going to get to David Knight's take on this on the other side.
[00:50:53.818 --> 00:50:55.578]  The big issue is they're coming for the guns.
[00:50:55.578 --> 00:50:56.059]  Period.
[00:50:56.059 --> 00:50:56.799]  Set the precedent.

[00:51:06.032 --> 00:51:08.034]  Their greenhouses simply snap together.

[00:51:09.134 --> 00:51:11.576]  As a greenhouse, it will stand for decades.
[00:51:11.576 --> 00:51:16.460]  It's incredibly strong, long-lasting, and it can be quickly put up or taken down.
[00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:19.382]  It is also ideal when used as an emergency shelter.

[00:51:28.809 --> 00:51:30.690]  By now, you've heard about Bitcoins.
[00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:34.173]  But did you know that over 65,000 businesses accept Bitcoins?
[00:51:34.173 --> 00:51:40.457]  Listen, if you're already earning Bitcoins or trying to make money in the Bitcoin market, you've gotta know BidBit.co.

[00:54:04.588 --> 00:54:07.491]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:07.491 --> 00:54:09.794]  I'm David Nye and Alex is joining us from the road.
[00:54:09.794 --> 00:54:14.058]  We've just been talking about the crisis for the Second Amendment and it is a crisis.
[00:54:14.804 --> 00:54:21.668]  They're trying to take the ammunition and they're doing it by writing their own rules at the executive level, at the bureaucratic level.
[00:54:21.668 --> 00:54:22.628]  What are we going to do about it?
[00:54:22.628 --> 00:54:26.731]  We just had a caller call in and talk about how you could no longer find brass.
[00:54:26.731 --> 00:54:31.293]  That's one of the first things the Obama administration did back in 2009.
[00:54:31.293 --> 00:54:36.656]  They said they were not going to let the military recycle brass back into the commercial market.
[00:54:36.656 --> 00:54:39.858]  They were going to have them crush it, sell it to the Chinese as scrap metal.
[00:54:40.498 --> 00:54:43.019]  They had a letter from Senators that said, don't do that.
[00:54:43.019 --> 00:54:44.900]  They said, we're going to change the policy and sell it.
[00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:56.984]  But Alex, we found years later that at least one place, I believe it was Fort Drum in New York, in their recycling plan, they were still crushing and selling brass instead of putting it back into the market.
[00:54:56.984 --> 00:54:59.525]  They want to take ammunition away from us.
[00:54:59.525 --> 00:55:01.386]  We have nothing but clubs if they do that.
[00:55:02.006 --> 00:55:11.575]  In fact, in early 2014, about a year ago, I guess it was in February last year, so over a year ago, the last lead smelting plant in the United States closed.
[00:55:11.575 --> 00:55:14.138]  So we cannot even smelt lead for bullets.
[00:55:14.138 --> 00:55:15.639]  We have to buy it from China.
[00:55:15.639 --> 00:55:19.883]  And then Obama can put embargoes, as he's announcing, on that executively.
[00:55:19.883 --> 00:55:21.485]  This is true treason.
[00:55:21.485 --> 00:55:25.249]  Now, when we start the next hour, Indico Kidd, Antoine, Doug, Dylan,
[00:55:25.729 --> 00:55:27.050]  Chris, we're going to go to your calls.
[00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:27.930]  Bam, bam, bam.
[00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:32.352]  So have your point or your comment ready on the Second Amendment and this crisis.
[00:55:32.352 --> 00:55:36.455]  Please don't forget the fact that we're listener-supported.
[00:55:36.455 --> 00:55:41.237]  We have high-quality nutraceuticals, the highest quality, like Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Booster.
[00:55:41.237 --> 00:55:46.440]  You can get a free bottle of that when you purchase two bottles of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:51.162]  That is our flagship, unprecedented form of iodine that no one else has.
[00:55:51.162 --> 00:55:52.623]  Truly amazing from our deep earth.
[00:55:53.203 --> 00:55:55.965]  Crystal Source, it's done amazing things for myself.
[00:55:55.965 --> 00:56:00.708]  It's the good halogen, blocks out those bad halogens in the thyroid and more.
[00:56:00.708 --> 00:56:06.611]  Now, we've got products that are $14.95, like a bottle of Ancient Defense, leading competitors with similar formulas.
[00:56:06.611 --> 00:56:17.138]  Well, I'll just tell you quite frankly, the big giant factory that makes it for us and does a great job, one of the biggest in the world, Organic, puts out a similar one and sold at Whole Foods for double that.
[00:56:17.138 --> 00:56:18.719]  But the point is, $14.95 is very affordable.
[00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:22.582]  High quality stuff, super affordable.
[00:56:22.582 --> 00:56:30.050]  We have things like DNA Force, where one ingredient, the Bio PQQ, is $12,000 a kilo.
[00:56:30.050 --> 00:56:32.272]  Well, we just purchased more to make a new run.
[00:56:32.272 --> 00:56:33.193]  It'll take about six weeks.
[00:56:33.193 --> 00:56:35.595]  We're going to sell out very soon of DNA Force.
[00:56:36.856 --> 00:56:40.360]  And it's going to cost more than $12,000 a kilo, okay?
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:44.004]  And it's got a bunch of those, you know, CoQ10, the true organic types.
[00:56:44.004 --> 00:56:46.967]  I mean, you can buy synthetic stuff for really cheap.
[00:56:46.967 --> 00:56:48.829]  This product is normally $154.
[00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:49.910]  We lowered it to $134 until it sells out.
[00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:51.151]  At this rate, it should sell out by next week.
[00:56:56.036 --> 00:56:56.757]  I just that's what I do.
[00:56:56.757 --> 00:56:59.159]  When something's already selling out, I just sell it for cheaper.
[00:56:59.159 --> 00:57:03.622]  Just an obnoxious free market thing I do to give folks the best deal ever.
[00:57:03.622 --> 00:57:04.003]  $94.47.
[00:57:04.003 --> 00:57:10.048]  So we have the Lamborghini Countach or the Ferrari quality DNA Force.
[00:57:10.048 --> 00:57:12.990]  Leading competitors $300 to $600.
[00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:17.514]  These have patented proven ingredients where you can actually make claims on them.
[00:57:17.514 --> 00:57:18.395]  You can go see the videos at
[00:57:18.615 --> 00:57:18.995]  Thank you.
[00:57:41.471 --> 00:57:44.574]  And I take two tablets a day.
[00:57:44.574 --> 00:57:48.577]  You've heard people call in because, I mean, this is one of the quote good side effects.
[00:57:48.577 --> 00:57:54.642]  If you've had nerves and stuff that are damaged, they'll get numb and fire up and then just, well, you know, I'm not going to even get into it.
[00:57:55.376 --> 00:57:58.338]  I'm just telling you, you've heard the listeners, this isn't a game.
[00:57:58.338 --> 00:58:00.380]  Look into what BioPQQ does.
[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:03.522]  Look at what CoQ10 does and all these other ingredients in here.
[00:58:03.522 --> 00:58:07.325]  You want supercharged, you know, longevity, quality.
[00:58:07.325 --> 00:58:08.586]  It's DNA Force.
[00:58:08.586 --> 00:58:13.410]  It is now discounted, ladies and gentlemen, a absolutely massive amount.
[00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:17.293]  DNA Force, 30% off the already discounted.
[00:58:17.293 --> 00:58:18.253]  It was $150-something.
[00:58:18.253 --> 00:58:18.554]  Now it's $94.47.
[00:58:23.357 --> 00:58:24.737]  And it will sell out.
[00:58:24.737 --> 00:58:34.140]  And I can tell you, after paying for it, and then after marketing, and after staff, everybody, we make about $20 on it when we're selling it for this price, okay?
[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:36.281]  So, and you're like, well that's a markup, Alex.
[00:58:36.281 --> 00:58:41.022]  I'm not complaining.
[00:58:41.022 --> 00:58:44.143]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:49.361 --> 00:58:50.302]  Alex Jones here.
[00:58:50.302 --> 00:58:59.530]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:58:59.530 --> 00:59:04.775]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and even GMOs.
[00:59:05.095 --> 00:59:08.816]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:59:08.816 --> 00:59:18.358]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge and prepare your body for what experts admit is the most dangerous season of the year.

[01:00:04.997 --> 01:00:06.298]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.298 --> 01:00:08.079]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.079 --> 01:00:09.841]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.841 --> 01:00:11.422]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.422 --> 01:00:12.963]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.963 --> 01:00:17.167]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.167 --> 01:00:21.210]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.534 --> 01:00:23.995]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:23.995 --> 01:00:25.135]  I'm David Knight in the studio.
[01:00:25.135 --> 01:00:30.017]  We have Alex Jones with us on the road, and we're talking about the Second Amendment.
[01:00:30.017 --> 01:00:35.119]  Now, the government has been coming after ammunition from the beginning of the Obama administration.
[01:00:35.119 --> 01:00:36.580]  They're banning components.
[01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:37.360]  They're not recycling.
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:38.020]  They're like lead.
[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:40.761]  They're not recycling the brass into the marketplace.
[01:00:40.761 --> 01:00:44.923]  They've passed the UNATT to try to... They've not passed it.
[01:00:44.923 --> 01:00:47.584]  They've had the Secretary of State sign it.
[01:00:47.584 --> 01:00:48.945]  But they're going to try to use that.
[01:00:49.625 --> 01:00:50.285]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:00:50.285 --> 01:00:54.686]  They're going to try to use that, Alex, to stop ammunition from coming across the borders as well.
[01:00:54.686 --> 01:01:02.088]  Because right now, because of the shortages and the panic in the American market, people are importing a lot of ammunition from abroad.
[01:01:02.088 --> 01:01:07.690]  And that's why they did the false flag, fast and furious, to try to support the UNATT.
[01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:09.510]  I mean, we are in the hands of criminals.
[01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:11.091]  David, let me ask you this question.
[01:01:11.091 --> 01:01:14.432]  Do you think they're doubling and tripling down because they know the country's waking up?
[01:01:14.432 --> 01:01:17.112]  I mean, that's what I see happening, but I don't want to be delusional.
[01:01:17.112 --> 01:01:18.733]  What do you really think in your spirit?
[01:01:19.693 --> 01:01:20.497]  I think that's true.
[01:01:20.497 --> 01:01:22.085]  I think there's also a time frame.
[01:01:22.085 --> 01:01:23.352]  I've talked about it several times.
[01:01:24.724 --> 01:01:33.648]  The fourth turning that some sociologists, Strauss and Howe, have noted a cycle in the history of man, of government.
[01:01:33.648 --> 01:01:35.629]  There seems to be a generational cycle.
[01:01:35.629 --> 01:01:43.073]  Everything they've been talking about is pointing to the 2020-2025 time frame that they're working on, so I think that's one aspect of it.
[01:01:43.073 --> 01:01:44.794]  I think people are also waking up.
[01:01:44.794 --> 01:01:46.474]  There's a lot of evidence that people are waking up.
[01:01:46.474 --> 01:01:48.635]  Look at what's going on with McDonald's.
[01:01:48.635 --> 01:01:53.718]  They've had nine straight months of declining sales, and of course New York Times is saying
[01:01:54.418 --> 01:02:01.281]  They're pulling the Monsanto growth hormone that makes your daughter 7 feet tall and grow giant cancers on record.
[01:02:01.281 --> 01:02:06.723]  They're pulling a bunch of other GMO and a bunch of other toxic things from their food.
[01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:08.684]  I mean, these announcements are daily, David.
[01:02:08.684 --> 01:02:12.746]  Like you said, because we still have some free market, we still have some internet.
[01:02:13.286 --> 01:02:22.550]  We're crushing them and that's why they want to come in with Google and start censoring health sites and alternative news and the stories we put out because the truth is getting out there.
[01:02:22.550 --> 01:02:24.371]  They're not stopping the signal.
[01:02:24.371 --> 01:02:27.132]  We're taking phone calls throughout this hour.
[01:02:27.132 --> 01:02:30.734]  I'm going to shut up now and get to one call before we go to break and come back and take others.
[01:02:30.734 --> 01:02:31.995]  Indico Kid on the
[01:02:33.175 --> 01:02:35.617]  Executive gun grab happening right now.
[01:02:35.617 --> 01:02:38.278]  Will we get stirred up like an anthill and do something?
[01:02:38.278 --> 01:02:40.220]  Or will we lie back and just let them take the guns?
[01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:44.882]  Because if they set the precedent here, 52 senators have said they're going to go for all the ammo.
[01:02:44.882 --> 01:02:47.604]  Of course they are.
[01:02:47.604 --> 01:02:59.131]  Well, Alex, so what I think will happen in America is that if we don't start having open carry marches, then we'll have stories like a break-in at four in the morning or some kid gets flash-banged or some baby or whatever.
[01:02:59.131 --> 01:03:01.493]  So eventually it will lead to open carry marches, but
[01:03:02.088 --> 01:03:08.172]  It's kind of a question of whether or not it will be like the Blondie Ranch or 1776, you know, like Lexington and Concord.
[01:03:08.172 --> 01:03:12.314]  And I think that they'll definitely blow up federal buildings.
[01:03:12.314 --> 01:03:19.338]  And like in my dream that I once had, there's like holding facilities where they have like illegals that are women and children only.
[01:03:19.338 --> 01:03:23.100]  They'll blow those up and start trying to like get a race war started and stuff.
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:29.544]  But ultimately, I think that if the House of Cards bureaucracy, that's really what will change things is when
[01:03:30.203 --> 01:03:36.065]  You know, you work for the ATF and then the DEA breaks into your house at four in the morning and shoots your kid and stuff like that.
[01:03:36.065 --> 01:03:45.888]  I mean, that's when, you know, like if you work for the CIA, the NSA is spying on you, CIA is spying on you, so eventually people are going to have to kind of shrug and just do what's common sense.
[01:03:45.888 --> 01:03:51.890]  And I've never really promoted anarchy or anything, but I think we're moving toward anarchy and the system is trying to game that.
[01:03:52.734 --> 01:04:04.297]  And the only way it could even possibly work is if people follow karmic principles, if there's spirituality involved, if we're informed citizenry, then we can maybe be capable of self-rule.
[01:04:04.297 --> 01:04:05.037]  Well, that's right.
[01:04:05.037 --> 01:04:13.659]  When you say a really deep point you're making right now, I want to hold you over to finish your point in the next segment and get David's take on this as well before we go to other callers.
[01:04:13.659 --> 01:04:15.339]  So don't hang up, Indigo Kid.
[01:04:15.339 --> 01:04:16.960]  Well, you know about karmic rules.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.260]  You know, I'm not a Zen Buddhist.
[01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:21.861]  But Christianity teaches you reap what you sow.
[01:04:21.861 --> 01:04:23.901]  In fact, what you do will come back on you.
[01:04:23.901 --> 01:04:26.242]  I inherently feel that in everything I do.
[01:04:26.242 --> 01:04:27.782]  It's called being God-fearing.
[01:04:27.782 --> 01:04:32.143]  These idiots that are building this tyranny think a tyranny is going to make them safe.
[01:04:32.143 --> 01:04:34.844]  It is the pit in which they're going to fall.
[01:04:34.844 --> 01:04:36.084]  So stay there, Indigo Kid.
[01:04:36.084 --> 01:04:40.665]  We're going to come back and get some more information from you on this, how we can stop it.
[01:04:40.665 --> 01:04:41.025]  I agree.
[01:04:41.025 --> 01:04:42.586]  Open carry nationwide is the answer.
[01:04:43.226 --> 01:04:43.546]  We're good to go.
[01:04:58.894 --> 01:05:02.397]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:05:02.397 --> 01:05:10.643]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:05:10.643 --> 01:05:16.067]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:05:16.067 --> 01:05:18.609]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:06:04.728 --> 01:06:05.569]  Security alert.
[01:06:05.569 --> 01:06:06.790]  Security alert.
[01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:08.791]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:06:08.791 --> 01:06:09.672]  Analysis.

[01:06:10.412 --> 01:06:12.373]  Building independent media operations.
[01:06:12.373 --> 01:06:17.377]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:06:17.377 --> 01:06:18.417]  Crying directive.
[01:06:18.417 --> 01:06:19.978]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:06:19.978 --> 01:06:22.820]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:26.062]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:06:26.062 --> 01:06:28.224]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:06:28.404 --> 01:06:29.865]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:06:29.865 --> 01:06:32.025]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:06:32.025 --> 01:06:34.646]  They are never going to stop.
[01:06:34.646 --> 01:06:38.688]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:06:38.688 --> 01:06:42.310]  Block free iPhone ads at InfoWars.com.

[01:06:45.651 --> 01:06:46.631]  Imperative.
[01:06:46.631 --> 01:06:48.572]  Destroy Little Minute TV.
[01:06:48.572 --> 01:06:53.354]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:06:53.354 --> 01:06:55.455]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[01:06:58.488 --> 01:07:04.610]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[01:07:04.610 --> 01:07:09.191]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:16.893]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[01:07:17.153 --> 01:07:22.677]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.

[01:07:37.509 --> 01:07:44.116]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[01:07:44.116 --> 01:07:49.281]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[01:07:49.281 --> 01:07:53.005]  Now available in our limited first run at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:53.005 --> 01:07:54.907]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:08:01.365 --> 01:08:04.149]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.149 --> 01:08:06.953]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:14.808 --> 01:08:18.830]  Hi folks, we are back live.
[01:08:18.830 --> 01:08:23.712]  David Knight is in the studio in Austin, Texas at the InfoWars News Center.
[01:08:23.712 --> 01:08:27.774]  There are a lot of key headlines at InfoWars.com we haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:08:27.774 --> 01:08:36.218]  We won't do that till later in the hour because I want to race through some of your phone calls right now as we look at the over-the-top incredible power grab from the FCC
[01:08:36.778 --> 01:08:39.921]  Grabbing the internet to Obama, putting our military under U.N.
[01:08:39.921 --> 01:09:01.158]  command, shutting off our power plants, opening the borders completely, giving the illegal Social Security cards, free tuition, free health care, free everything, Obamacare wrecking things, doubling, tripling prices, now ammo bans with the Democrats saying they're going to go after basically all the ammo, 42 senators warn that they will go after all the ammo.
[01:09:01.158 --> 01:09:03.159]  I mean, it is just epic what's going on.
[01:09:03.159 --> 01:09:05.922]  Other headlines, lie before sex, you're a rapist.
[01:09:06.949 --> 01:09:14.332]  New Snowden documents, CIA documents showed how 10 years ago they had meetings on how to put back doors into all the new smartphones.
[01:09:14.332 --> 01:09:18.554]  UN says conservatism a threat to women's rights downplays Islam.
[01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:23.196]  Yeah, they're chopping women's genitals off and torturing them and selling them to rape slave gangs.
[01:09:23.196 --> 01:09:27.898]  That's trendy and liberal because it's a foreign culture.
[01:09:27.898 --> 01:09:29.719]  But if you like NASCAR and wear pants,
[01:09:31.272 --> 01:09:35.555]  And your wife didn't tell you to step and fetch it and you actually just get along with your wife?
[01:09:35.555 --> 01:09:37.196]  You're a bad person.
[01:09:37.196 --> 01:09:38.076]  That's right.
[01:09:38.076 --> 01:09:42.579]  Obama signs executive order declaring Venezuela a national security threat.
[01:09:42.579 --> 01:09:46.301]  Venezuela is to biometrically fingerprint you when you go to the grocery store now?
[01:09:47.475 --> 01:09:49.677]  And it's a tyranny in Venezuela.
[01:09:49.677 --> 01:09:50.818]  It's a great evil.
[01:09:50.818 --> 01:09:53.221]  Oh, look at the communist dictatorship.
[01:09:53.221 --> 01:09:54.562]  Oh, my gosh.
[01:09:54.562 --> 01:10:02.530]  But when I complain about it at the DMV or scanners going in on the Microsoft system, it's like, oh, big deal, Alex.
[01:10:02.530 --> 01:10:05.173]  Well, wait till they track everything you do and tax everything you do.
[01:10:05.173 --> 01:10:09.677]  That's where all of this is going.
[01:10:09.677 --> 01:10:09.917]  Again,
[01:10:11.243 --> 01:10:14.085]  If you just joined us, what are we going to do to defend the Second Amendment?
[01:10:14.085 --> 01:10:16.628]  Well, first we have to get the true talking points out.
[01:10:16.628 --> 01:10:23.033]  This .223 green tip ammo ban is meant to be expanded into basically every other caliber out there.
[01:10:23.033 --> 01:10:24.834]  They want to get handguns you can hide.
[01:10:24.834 --> 01:10:27.116]  They want to get semi-automatic rifles.
[01:10:27.116 --> 01:10:32.401]  If they can get the Bushmaster, if they can get the .223, if they can get the M4 variant, they can get them all.
[01:10:33.342 --> 01:10:34.442]  So we've got that.
[01:10:34.442 --> 01:10:42.786]  But it's all part of a larger power grab where they won't block Obama on grabbing the borders and leaving them wide open.
[01:10:42.786 --> 01:10:44.867]  They won't go after Obama on going after the guns.
[01:10:44.867 --> 01:10:48.628]  They won't go after him on anything because the Republican leadership won't get the same.
[01:10:48.628 --> 01:10:55.971]  So the big issue here is what do we do to shut this down?
[01:10:55.971 --> 01:11:00.993]  What do we do to get the message out that the globalists have dropped the hammer?
[01:11:00.993 --> 01:11:02.294]  It's kind of like you're on a roller coaster.
[01:11:04.445 --> 01:11:05.019]  Up to the top!
[01:11:05.856 --> 01:11:09.219]  We've now gotten to the top, and we're getting ready to roll down the hill.
[01:11:09.219 --> 01:11:12.301]  In fact, we've already started to go down the hill, folks.
[01:11:12.301 --> 01:11:15.324]  We're that deep into this analogy now.
[01:11:15.324 --> 01:11:16.665]  I was hoping we were at the top of the hill.
[01:11:16.665 --> 01:11:21.289]  We're now starting to go down the roller coaster, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:21.289 --> 01:11:24.091]  And we had just better get the country out of the coma.
[01:11:24.091 --> 01:11:26.573]  Yes, it's somewhat awake, but not all the way.
[01:11:26.573 --> 01:11:29.956]  David, get your take on what I just said, some of the other news stories you want to hit.
[01:11:29.956 --> 01:11:33.900]  We're going to go to Indigo Kid, Doug, Antoine, Dylan, and Chris in short order.
[01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:45.894]  You know, Alex, it is very concerning to see that the government, of course, is practicing these door-to-door raids, you know, saying that they're there to help you, not just to come in and arrest you and confiscate the guns.
[01:11:45.894 --> 01:11:50.019]  But, you know, they don't have to confiscate the guns if they shut down the supply of ammunition.
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:53.642]  And it makes it very easy for them to confiscate the guns if they do that.
[01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:56.945]  We've always heard the thing that the citizens' power comes out of boxes.
[01:11:56.945 --> 01:12:01.789]  We've got the jury box, the election box, we've got the cartridge box.
[01:12:01.789 --> 01:12:03.510]  It wasn't the gun, it was the cartridge box.
[01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:05.612]  You've got to have the ammunition.
[01:12:05.612 --> 01:12:09.475]  That's why the Obama administration's been after the ammunition from the get-go.
[01:12:09.475 --> 01:12:11.456]  And of course, how do we support all those?
[01:12:11.456 --> 01:12:17.080]  We support those with the soap box, the First Amendment, waking people up to what the danger is.
[01:12:18.081 --> 01:12:19.002]  Sorry?
[01:12:19.002 --> 01:12:20.263]  And it's under attack as well.
[01:12:20.263 --> 01:12:21.423]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:12:21.423 --> 01:12:24.806]  And you know, people don't even know what their rights are as jurors.
[01:12:24.806 --> 01:12:27.247]  So we have to educate them as to what their rights are as jurors.
[01:12:27.247 --> 01:12:35.313]  And we have to educate them as to what their rights are as citizens being able to own weapons, the right to keep and bear arms when the
[01:12:36.093 --> 01:12:52.181]  Senators, the 52 senators who sent this protest letter to the AFDF saying that, you know, you have set up without any support, you purport to create an objective test never before applied for delineating which projectiles are primarily intended to be used for sporting purposes.
[01:12:52.181 --> 01:13:01.145]  Well fine, yes, they have done this, they have just gone out on their own, they purport to set up an objective standard, but the Senate still doesn't get it.
[01:13:01.145 --> 01:13:02.606]  It's not even about
[01:13:03.616 --> 01:13:05.299]  Using this stuff for sporting purposes.
[01:13:05.299 --> 01:13:07.101]  They won't address that issue.
[01:13:07.101 --> 01:13:08.884]  And that's the core thing, Alex.
[01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:09.425]  Well, that's right.
[01:13:09.425 --> 01:13:11.047]  And they're setting the precedent again.
[01:13:11.047 --> 01:13:13.651]  If they could ban one type of ammo, the most popular, they could ban it all.
[01:13:13.651 --> 01:13:15.814]  Now, let's pull back before we go to this call.
[01:13:15.814 --> 01:13:16.836]  You just hit something key there.
[01:13:18.194 --> 01:13:22.899]  If you want to shut down cars and people traveling, you make gas more expensive.
[01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:32.949]  And the Bilderberg Group, in public memos and then also from our sources, is always obsessing on, we want to shut down the economy so that there can't be protesters here.
[01:13:32.949 --> 01:13:41.417]  They understand that having some money, being middle class, gives you autonomy, gives you a position to negotiate with the powers that be.
[01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:44.040]  From a position of strength.
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:49.107]  Why, in ancient war, would you have a siege around a city for a year to then make them give up?
[01:13:49.107 --> 01:13:52.972]  Because if you're starving to death, you don't have any negotiation power.
[01:13:52.972 --> 01:13:55.535]  And that's why they want us dependent, under-clowered, and pivoted.
[01:13:55.535 --> 01:13:58.679]  And that's why they don't want you to know how to skin a buck or run a truck line.
[01:13:58.679 --> 01:13:59.681]  And it's going to be...
[01:14:00.882 --> 01:14:05.526]  Hillbilly, true redneck culture for blacks, Hispanics, whites, I don't care.
[01:14:05.526 --> 01:14:10.031]  You go to Mexico, the folks that are independent down there are more redneck than any redneck I ever saw in Texas.
[01:14:10.031 --> 01:14:11.752]  They don't want wild men.
[01:14:11.752 --> 01:14:13.153]  They don't want hill people.
[01:14:13.153 --> 01:14:26.105]  They don't want folks like that with solar power, with technology, that know how to run machine shops, and know how to reload ammo, and know how to skin a buck, run a trot line, and who run their own government, and who have farmers markets.
[01:14:27.210 --> 01:14:38.418]  And that's why they're going after the ammo, buying it out, driving up prices, banning importation, restricting the brass, not letting the military sell it back into civilian reloading.
[01:14:38.418 --> 01:14:46.144]  Almost all .308, .223 I used to buy, or 9mm when I was younger and that was the military round, was reloaded US military.
[01:14:46.144 --> 01:14:48.026]  Very inexpensive, high quality.
[01:14:48.786 --> 01:14:55.554]  They are trying to make it elitist to have guns and ammo so that it isn't a popular thing in the culture.
[01:14:55.554 --> 01:14:58.558]  The globalist is so key that we're going to your calls.
[01:14:58.558 --> 01:15:05.707]  I want everyone to listen up and listen up good because when I'm cogitating, when I'm calm, driving on a road trip and really think about how to beat the enemy...
[01:15:07.355 --> 01:15:08.236]  I know how to beat them.
[01:15:08.236 --> 01:15:08.917]  It's common sense.
[01:15:08.917 --> 01:15:09.758]  It's history.
[01:15:09.758 --> 01:15:12.060]  Culture beats culture.
[01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:15.143]  Velvet Revolution beats their system.
[01:15:15.143 --> 01:15:23.553]  We have a culture that's powerful, that's sexy, that's God-given, that has prowess, that is common sense, that is empowering.
[01:15:24.073 --> 01:15:40.181]  And a gun culture with men and women together hunting and shooting and defending and killing criminals when they come in your house and standing up and taking our streets back and the prosperity that comes with it is so empowering.
[01:15:41.201 --> 01:16:00.134]  They want to drive up prices simply so that the general public can't exercise in it and can't be part of it because so many liberals are getting deprogrammed and are getting the gun bug and are, I mean you go down to Austin, the mega city most popular for LA Trendies and others and New York Trendies to flee their collapsing globalist compounds.
[01:16:00.134 --> 01:16:04.197]  You go and it's liberals buying guns, it's liberals wearing
[01:16:04.597 --> 01:16:07.999]  Blue jeans and cut-off shirts and driving Ford pickup trucks.
[01:16:07.999 --> 01:16:18.463]  It's liberals going and literally bringing back country dancing, two-stepping, and basically modern square dancing at all the new hot clubs in Austin.
[01:16:18.463 --> 01:16:30.069]  You go to these things, there's like 500 people, women, men, dancing, black, white, old, young, doesn't matter, and they're absolutely adopting Americana hillbilly culture.
[01:16:30.069 --> 01:16:30.889]  The globalists are
[01:16:31.049 --> 01:16:44.583]  They're panicking right now, trying to teach five-year-olds how to engage in oral sex, trying to inject trannies into the bathroom to freak everybody out and cause a fake debate while we're all being robbed, and meanwhile the liberals are finding Excalibur.
[01:16:44.583 --> 01:16:47.126]  They're finding that a free man has a gun.
[01:16:47.126 --> 01:16:48.688]  They're finding what it's all about.
[01:16:48.688 --> 01:16:49.749]  The women want it!
[01:16:50.049 --> 01:16:50.489]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:16:50.489 --> 01:16:51.750]  Well, I'm a life coach.
[01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.910]  I have a...
[01:17:18.852 --> 01:17:20.433]  Exercise here, people can do.
[01:17:20.433 --> 01:17:22.735]  In the left-hand column, you write entitlement.
[01:17:22.735 --> 01:17:26.598]  That's the title of the left-hand column, and in the right-hand column, you can title it gratitude.
[01:17:26.598 --> 01:17:32.622]  So, under entitlement, you write self-esteem, and diametrically opposed to that under gratitude is self-compassion.
[01:17:32.622 --> 01:17:35.905]  Those are really different ideas people should research.
[01:17:35.905 --> 01:17:43.130]  Also under entitlement, you have destructive narcissism, which is the opposite of healthy narcissism, which is kind of a dumb term, but you can look it up on Wikipedia.
[01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:47.053]  Basically, Western innovation has been pushed by healthy narcissism.
[01:17:47.677 --> 01:17:53.959]  And under entitlement, you also have relative truth, which biometrically opposes absolute truth, as you know, Alex.
[01:17:53.959 --> 01:18:05.662]  The relative truth movement basically says, I'm trendy, therefore, if Muslims want to rape kids, radical Muslims, then that's their business, where absolute truth says that's absolutely not the case.
[01:18:05.662 --> 01:18:09.064]  And finally, a fatalism biometrically opposes karmic principles.
[01:18:09.064 --> 01:18:12.204]  Those are just terms that people can look up, but it's all the same thing.
[01:18:12.204 --> 01:18:13.765]  Entitlement, that's left-hand magic.
[01:18:14.386 --> 01:18:17.309]  The Judeo-Christian sense, gratitude, white hand magic.
[01:18:17.309 --> 01:18:19.131]  There's thousands of ways to look at it, really.
[01:18:20.575 --> 01:18:29.980]  Well, I mean, listen, when I get into the trendies, getting into wearing checkered shirts and blue jeans and cowboy boots and buying guns, that scares the system.
[01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:37.583]  Because if guns become trendy, which they have, all the top shows on TV were gun shows, you notice they all kind of got removed last year.
[01:18:37.583 --> 01:18:42.306]  All these shooting shows got cancelled, even though they had top ratings, because we're winning.
[01:18:42.306 --> 01:18:44.347]  David Knight, I mean, do you agree with that statement?
[01:18:45.126 --> 01:18:57.075]  I agree, I think we're winning the information war, but I also agree with what you were saying, that the attack is not just on removing our ammunition, it's on making us poor, so that we can't resist what they're doing.
[01:18:57.075 --> 01:19:05.142]  And that kind of stratification, Alex, we had a story on Infowars.com earlier today, 95% of new homes are being built for the rich and for the poor.
[01:19:05.822 --> 01:19:06.082]  That's right.
[01:19:06.082 --> 01:19:07.283]  Not middle class homes.
[01:19:07.283 --> 01:19:16.790]  So it's these two extremes, eliminating the middle class, which is what the people who want to control you, the people who are authoritarians, the people who are socialists, they hate the middle class.
[01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:18.451]  The bourgeoisie, as they call it.
[01:19:18.451 --> 01:19:23.235]  And they're eliminating that and you can see that right now in the people that can afford to have homes.
[01:19:23.235 --> 01:19:25.156]  Of course, the poor homes are being bought for them.
[01:19:25.156 --> 01:19:29.420]  They want everybody to be poor and dependent on this small elite ruling class.
[01:19:30.288 --> 01:19:31.648]  Absolutely criminal.
[01:19:31.648 --> 01:19:32.609]  It's called slavery.
[01:19:32.609 --> 01:19:34.089]  It's called domestication.
[01:19:34.089 --> 01:19:35.409]  It's called bondage.
[01:19:35.409 --> 01:19:39.030]  The middle class is the ladder for the poor people to innovate.
[01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:40.450]  It's the renaissance engine.
[01:19:40.450 --> 01:19:41.370]  Everyone knows it.
[01:19:41.370 --> 01:19:47.592]  But notice all the snot-nosed criticisms in media of the nuclear family and how three meals a day is racist.
[01:19:47.592 --> 01:19:49.672]  No, cutting off Africa's food is racist.
[01:19:49.672 --> 01:19:50.592]  We're going to expose it all.
[01:19:50.592 --> 01:19:53.413]  We're going right to your calls, straight ahead on the other side of the break.
[01:19:53.413 --> 01:19:54.533]  It's the fight for the Second Amendment.
[01:19:59.184 --> 01:20:02.788]  Why use dial-up when you can use broadband?
[01:20:02.788 --> 01:20:03.789]  Why travel with this?
[01:20:04.850 --> 01:20:06.711]  When you can use this.
[01:20:06.711 --> 01:20:12.693]  And why would anyone use colloidal or ionic silver when you can use supernatural silver?
[01:20:12.693 --> 01:20:19.915]  Supernatural silver is state-of-the-art and it's been clinically proven to be several hundred times more effective than those other silvers.
[01:20:19.915 --> 01:20:25.857]  It's powerful enough to protect you and your family from the threat of deadly viruses, bacteria and fungus.
[01:20:25.857 --> 01:20:29.078]  But it's so safe that it can be used internally or topically.
[01:20:29.578 --> 01:20:34.260]  And you'll never again deal with the nasty side effects of harsh drugs or antibiotics.
[01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:44.784]  Hundreds of scientific studies by independent universities, hospitals, and research institutions have all shown Supernatural Silver is a powerful weapon in the fight against invading pathogens.
[01:20:44.784 --> 01:20:48.005]  Supernatural Silver is a must-have for your arsenal.

[01:21:58.246 --> 01:22:07.550]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:22:07.550 --> 01:22:08.330]  This capitalism?
[01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:14.493]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:14.493 --> 01:22:18.194]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[01:22:57.632 --> 01:22:59.574]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:22:59.574 --> 01:23:03.197]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[01:23:03.197 --> 01:23:04.558]  A pair of scissors.
[01:23:04.558 --> 01:23:10.343]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[01:23:10.343 --> 01:23:15.287]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[01:23:15.287 --> 01:23:16.268]  The phone line.
[01:23:16.268 --> 01:23:21.533]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[01:23:21.533 --> 01:23:25.256]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[01:23:25.416 --> 01:23:28.719]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[01:23:28.719 --> 01:23:31.201]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.

[01:23:59.586 --> 01:24:02.349]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:24:02.349 --> 01:24:05.032]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:09.002 --> 01:24:14.344]  The tendency to get so wound up when they're attacking the borders, our sovereignty, our children, the Second Amendment.
[01:24:14.344 --> 01:24:17.725]  The Second Amendment or abortion issue, I just go off the chart.
[01:24:17.725 --> 01:24:20.006]  So people have been holding, we haven't gotten but to two callers.
[01:24:20.006 --> 01:24:25.507]  We're going to now neurotically, I promise, go to call after call to get your take on how do we defend the Second Amendment?
[01:24:25.507 --> 01:24:27.228]  What's the next big shoe to drop?
[01:24:27.228 --> 01:24:31.789]  Am I being hysterical about Obama becoming a dictator and just power grabbing everything?
[01:24:31.789 --> 01:24:32.950]  I mean, I'm not.
[01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:34.270]  But so what do we do?
[01:24:34.270 --> 01:24:35.851]  Do we abandon ship?
[01:24:36.491 --> 01:24:38.196]  It's a global government, there's nowhere to run!
[01:24:38.196 --> 01:24:40.222]  Do we have a civil war with these people?
[01:24:40.222 --> 01:24:42.048]  They're gonna blow stuff up and frame us!
[01:24:43.029 --> 01:24:45.050]  I mean, we're going to probably have one whether we want one or not.
[01:24:45.050 --> 01:24:47.110]  I mean, it's just we're in the hands of criminals.
[01:24:47.110 --> 01:24:49.511]  David Knight's co-hosting from Austin, Texas with us.
[01:24:49.511 --> 01:24:52.711]  I'll be back tomorrow co-hosting the whole three hours.
[01:24:52.711 --> 01:24:55.932]  And then I'm taking off Thursday and back in studio Friday.
[01:24:55.932 --> 01:24:57.253]  Again, David Knight doing a great job.
[01:24:57.253 --> 01:25:01.154]  Wanted to take my kids down to the Texas coast for a few days so they could do some deep sea fishing.
[01:25:01.154 --> 01:25:07.795]  And so I'm enjoying the rainy Texas coast right now, but still on the job because wild horses couldn't drag me away.
[01:25:07.795 --> 01:25:09.756]  Antoine in California, thanks for holding.
[01:25:09.756 --> 01:25:10.276]  You're on the air.
[01:25:11.986 --> 01:25:13.088]  Yeah, this is Antoine.
[01:25:13.088 --> 01:25:14.169]  Can you hear me, Alex?
[01:25:14.169 --> 01:25:14.650]  Yes, sir.
[01:25:14.650 --> 01:25:15.211]  Welcome.
[01:25:15.211 --> 01:25:16.292]  Alex?
[01:25:16.292 --> 01:25:17.073]  Okay, yeah.
[01:25:17.073 --> 01:25:25.825]  So I wanted to talk about how the dictatorship and the censorship and all of this is because I think
[01:25:26.562 --> 01:25:30.425]  That we are, like you said, a mass awakening is about to happen.
[01:25:30.425 --> 01:25:36.910]  So I think it'll really hit the pay dirt once this election starts and these debates start.
[01:25:36.910 --> 01:25:41.553]  I think that they're really, really afraid of these debates.
[01:25:41.553 --> 01:25:45.997]  I think once these debates start, they're going to start talking and you're going to start hearing all these
[01:25:46.597 --> 01:25:52.141]  I think it's one of the worst, like, debated, debated about presidents, debates for presidents I've ever seen.
[01:25:52.141 --> 01:25:52.941]  Like, there should be more talk.
[01:26:15.795 --> 01:26:20.539]  David Knight pointed out that it's inter-agency fighting is a bad thing, but it's also a good thing.
[01:26:20.539 --> 01:26:22.000]  Separation of powers.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:30.486]  Even though they've gotten rid of separation of powers with the legislative executive judicial, there's still a natural infighting within the agencies themselves.
[01:26:31.567 --> 01:26:31.947]  I think so.
[01:26:51.837 --> 01:26:52.257]  I don't know.
[01:26:52.257 --> 01:26:53.078]  I hope so, Alex.
[01:26:53.078 --> 01:26:57.220]  I mean, we've seen all these revelations about what the NSA is doing.
[01:26:57.220 --> 01:26:58.420]  People got very angry about it.
[01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:03.282]  Have we seen them camping out on people's offices?
[01:27:03.282 --> 01:27:05.964]  Have we seen any changes being proposed?
[01:27:05.964 --> 01:27:06.264]  No.
[01:27:06.264 --> 01:27:07.684]  People are getting used to it.
[01:27:07.684 --> 01:27:08.425]  They're accepting it.
[01:27:08.425 --> 01:27:10.226]  They're saying, yeah, of course, they're watching us.
[01:27:10.226 --> 01:27:13.007]  You know, just yesterday, Apple came out with a new wristwatch.
[01:27:13.007 --> 01:27:14.848]  It's going to be an accessory to your iPhone.
[01:27:15.228 --> 01:27:16.329]  And that's what it's going to do.
[01:27:16.329 --> 01:27:17.190]  It's going to watch you.
[01:27:17.190 --> 01:27:21.974]  It's going to push this idea that it's going to be monitoring your biometrics.
[01:27:21.974 --> 01:27:22.614]  It's a healthy thing.
[01:27:22.614 --> 01:27:23.555]  That's how they mainline it.
[01:27:23.555 --> 01:27:27.298]  They go over the top to the power of 10, where we're not spying on anything.
[01:27:27.298 --> 01:27:31.782]  Absolutely, the watch knows where you go, your heartbeat, what you eat, what you do.
[01:27:31.782 --> 01:27:32.563]  It tracks you.
[01:27:32.563 --> 01:27:33.664]  It keeps a database.
[01:27:33.664 --> 01:27:35.165]  All the TVs are watching you.
[01:27:35.165 --> 01:27:37.367]  You're in a free country, but Alex Jones is a kook.
[01:27:37.367 --> 01:27:39.028]  And don't listen to InfoWars.com.
[01:27:39.028 --> 01:27:39.689]  Absolutely, David.
[01:27:39.929 --> 01:27:47.271]  You know, there's another article that was up on Drudge Report today about new memories being implanted in mice while they sleep.
[01:27:47.271 --> 01:27:49.912]  And it starts out, sleeping minds, prepare to be hacked.
[01:27:49.912 --> 01:27:52.473]  This is an experiment, Alex, they did in Paris, France.
[01:27:52.473 --> 01:28:00.476]  And of course, we've seen the DARPA funding this same type of research, saying that they want to remove bad memories from people.
[01:28:00.476 --> 01:28:04.057]  We want to help the troops with PTSD.
[01:28:04.057 --> 01:28:05.858]  That's not the way it's going to be used.
[01:28:05.858 --> 01:28:09.159]  It's going to be used against political opponents, against enemies of the state.
[01:28:10.114 --> 01:28:10.835]  You're absolutely right.
[01:28:10.835 --> 01:28:12.538]  Let's jam in another call here.
[01:28:12.538 --> 01:28:13.359]  Thank you, Antoine.
[01:28:13.359 --> 01:28:15.783]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dylan in Texas.
[01:28:15.783 --> 01:28:16.324]  You're on the air.
[01:28:16.324 --> 01:28:16.604]  Go ahead.
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:19.701]  Hey guys, good afternoon.
[01:28:19.701 --> 01:28:21.841]  God bless you and thank you for everything you're doing.
[01:28:21.841 --> 01:28:30.504]  Real quickly, one of two things I think what we're going to have to do is, is there's going to have to be basically a constitutional take back of our rights at the White House.
[01:28:30.504 --> 01:28:45.690]  Meaning there's going to have to be, you know, some quite number of gathering of people and we're going to have to basically throw these people out of office as a collective and agree upon the people that we want to emplace immediately if we're actually serious about doing anything and actually
[01:28:46.110 --> 01:28:46.670]  We're good to go.
[01:29:15.299 --> 01:29:18.782]  Well, remember, the globalists pretty much are foreign, pretty much European.
[01:29:18.782 --> 01:29:22.444]  And they've, yeah, they've made an alliance with China, and they're totally selling us out.
[01:29:22.444 --> 01:29:26.608]  They'll probably break that alliance later, but they're basically all ganged up on Russia right now.
[01:29:26.608 --> 01:29:28.889]  And that doesn't mean that Russia are angel cakes.
[01:29:28.889 --> 01:29:30.631]  It just means they're not offensive.
[01:29:30.631 --> 01:29:33.693]  They're being ganged up on because they're seen as the weakest.
[01:29:33.693 --> 01:29:37.156]  The Russians always get seen as the weakest by Hitler, Napoleon, you name it.
[01:29:37.156 --> 01:29:39.257]  And they find out that's not the case.
[01:29:39.257 --> 01:29:42.580]  The Russians only seem to get up and get fighting once they're cornered.
[01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:43.641]  We'll be back with more calls.
[01:29:43.641 --> 01:29:44.261]  Thank you, caller.
[01:29:44.261 --> 01:29:44.882]  Great points, Dylan.
[01:29:48.365 --> 01:29:52.293]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.293 --> 01:29:54.958]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.068 --> 01:30:08.055]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[01:30:08.055 --> 01:30:18.602]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[01:30:18.602 --> 01:30:24.667]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:30:25.007 --> 01:30:31.414]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:30:31.414 --> 01:30:40.023]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[01:30:40.023 --> 01:30:43.107]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:30:43.107 --> 01:30:44.248]  No needles, no injections.
[01:30:44.608 --> 01:30:46.009]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:30:46.009 --> 01:30:47.209]  Try it for yourself.
[01:30:47.209 --> 01:30:48.530]  Discover the secret.
[01:30:48.530 --> 01:30:49.631]  Secret 12.
[01:30:49.631 --> 01:30:51.972]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.
[01:30:51.972 --> 01:30:55.834]  Secure yours today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:30:59.028 --> 01:31:02.690]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:31:02.690 --> 01:31:06.973]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:31:06.973 --> 01:31:08.754]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:31:08.754 --> 01:31:14.077]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[01:31:14.077 --> 01:31:16.598]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[01:31:16.598 --> 01:31:17.739]  But for how long?

[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:24.383]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:31:24.383 --> 01:31:26.264]  Infidel Body Armor.
[01:31:26.264 --> 01:31:27.205]  Just won't quit.
[01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:32.072]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:32.072 --> 01:31:40.316]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:40.316 --> 01:31:45.739]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:31:45.739 --> 01:31:48.260]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:31:48.260 --> 01:31:50.381]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[01:32:15.277 --> 01:32:23.302]  You don't have to be a doctor to know the fall and winter months are the most dangerous time of year in North America when it comes to you and your family's health.

[01:32:53.087 --> 01:32:53.448]  Silver Bullet.
[01:33:12.199 --> 01:33:15.060]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:16.340]  I'm David Knight in Austin.
[01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:19.541]  Joining us on the road is Alex Jones and we're talking about the Second Amendment.
[01:33:19.541 --> 01:33:21.041]  Alex, how do we pull this back?
[01:33:21.041 --> 01:33:28.042]  How do we pull back this bureaucratic executive order to take our ammunition?
[01:33:28.042 --> 01:33:35.664]  Well, the only time I've ever had success in my life is when I get angry and get focused and actually state what's going on versus the rhetoric they put out.
[01:33:37.219 --> 01:33:40.601]  You know, the FCC claims they're protecting the Internet.
[01:33:40.601 --> 01:33:42.542]  Well, they have no business regulating it.
[01:33:42.542 --> 01:33:43.402]  Yes.
[01:33:43.402 --> 01:33:47.184]  The Patriot Act is not patriotic unless you're patriotic to tyranny.
[01:33:47.184 --> 01:33:48.424]  All these Orwellian names.
[01:33:48.424 --> 01:33:54.327]  And when I was 20 years old, they were trying to pass laws in the Statehouse here in Texas.
[01:33:54.327 --> 01:33:55.768]  People asked how you defeated them.
[01:33:55.768 --> 01:33:58.269]  I'm going to kind of tell it in a story, a parable.
[01:33:58.269 --> 01:34:00.790]  A true story, but an allegory.
[01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:02.031]  And I went down to the Statehouse.
[01:34:02.031 --> 01:34:05.973]  I went and got involved in the different Second Amendment organizations.
[01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:14.423]  Because they were going to ban people under 18 being able to shoot guns with their parents, the different shooting clubs, the YMCA, you name it.
[01:34:14.423 --> 01:34:16.123]  They were going to ban gun shows.
[01:34:16.123 --> 01:34:20.965]  I understood that that was a move to take our guns, not a move to protect the children.
[01:34:20.965 --> 01:34:24.126]  Not that I was a rocket scientist, I just knew that was fundamental.
[01:34:24.126 --> 01:34:30.548]  By getting politically involved at one level, I then became somewhat seasoned and learned about how other things worked.
[01:34:31.496 --> 01:34:34.837]  And I'd also studied a lot of history, so I wasn't doomed to repeat it.
[01:34:34.837 --> 01:34:40.219]  I understood classical forms of manipulation, deception, and oppression when I was witnessing it.
[01:34:40.219 --> 01:34:48.701]  We have a politically, and geopolitically, and culturally illiterate population on average.
[01:34:48.701 --> 01:34:53.823]  Now the globalists have done that so that they are dealing with basically a population that's ignorant.
[01:34:53.823 --> 01:34:54.663]  That goes without saying.
[01:34:56.052 --> 01:35:13.184]  But that actually is a downfall for the system because we can wake up their people that they've been controlling very easily with crash courses in history and common sense because ingrained in them are still the instincts to recognize what's happening.
[01:35:13.184 --> 01:35:21.169]  And there are a lot more of us that are awake and understand what's going on out of the sea of dumbed-down people than there are globalist controllers.
[01:35:21.169 --> 01:35:22.430]  So we really have
[01:35:24.127 --> 01:35:27.129]  The leg up, the initiative on so many fronts.
[01:35:27.129 --> 01:35:28.390]  You ask, how do we defeat it?
[01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:29.791]  I want to get your take on it.
[01:35:29.791 --> 01:35:31.693]  I want to get listeners take on it.
[01:35:31.693 --> 01:35:36.036]  And I want to ask listeners, we're about to go right back to in a moment, what they think the next shoe is to drop.
[01:35:37.168 --> 01:35:40.470]  But, David, I think we label this what it is.
[01:35:40.470 --> 01:35:48.653]  Not, hey, come on, the cops say this is hardly used in crime and it hardly ever suits a cop.
[01:35:48.653 --> 01:35:50.754]  And, you know, why are you doing that?
[01:35:50.754 --> 01:35:55.516]  No, you're setting a precedent to ban almost all ammo.
[01:35:55.516 --> 01:35:57.957]  You've said you want to go after the Second Amendment.
[01:35:57.957 --> 01:35:58.958]  You've done it.
[01:35:58.958 --> 01:36:00.038]  You promised you wouldn't.
[01:36:00.038 --> 01:36:02.980]  You've been caught staging a false flag.
[01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:05.701]  You are criminals that want a totalitarian takeover.
[01:36:07.540 --> 01:36:09.902]  While you arm against us, you want us disarmed.
[01:36:09.902 --> 01:36:11.323]  It's very simple.
[01:36:11.323 --> 01:36:13.304]  You are criminals.
[01:36:13.304 --> 01:36:17.227]  And once you just raise the rhetoric to that level, that's what defeats them.
[01:36:17.227 --> 01:36:21.109]  They always don't have rhetoric, don't be aggressive, don't say radical things.
[01:36:21.109 --> 01:36:23.331]  Well, when they're radically power grabbing,
[01:36:24.434 --> 01:36:29.838]  We have to state what they're doing, and yes, it's going to sound radical, because we're just a mirror of what they're doing.
[01:36:29.838 --> 01:36:33.081]  For every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction in Newtonian physics.
[01:36:33.081 --> 01:36:38.706]  So, A, we got to get mad, we got to get stirred up, we've got to get aggressive, and we've got to take...
[01:36:39.764 --> 01:36:44.686]  Liberal trendy brainwash heads out to shoot guns religiously.
[01:36:44.686 --> 01:36:55.711]  All of us have to pick one of these victims, one of these conditioned jellyfish slaves of the state and not call them names like I just did.
[01:36:55.711 --> 01:36:56.232]  I know it's hard.
[01:36:56.952 --> 01:37:03.923]  But lovingly understand, these are brainwashed creatures who didn't have fathers that taught them how to skin a buck or run a trot line.
[01:37:03.923 --> 01:37:06.166]  These are people that don't get independence.
[01:37:06.166 --> 01:37:09.090]  These are people that don't get having a gun in your house.
[01:37:09.090 --> 01:37:11.754]  Not because you live in fear, but because you live in strength.
[01:37:11.754 --> 01:37:12.215]  We have to...
[01:37:12.856 --> 01:37:14.176]  Get people into guns.
[01:37:14.176 --> 01:37:15.717]  Get people into self-defense.
[01:37:15.717 --> 01:37:17.237]  We have to promote the family.
[01:37:17.237 --> 01:37:19.978]  We have to explain that the enemy is trying to bring us down.
[01:37:19.978 --> 01:37:25.040]  We have to come together and not just attack the feminists at the low level because they're just victims as well.
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:28.601]  Explain to them how it's a disempowerment social engineering program.
[01:37:28.601 --> 01:37:30.721]  Show them the different documents and proof.
[01:37:30.721 --> 01:37:31.782]  And people are ready.
[01:37:31.782 --> 01:37:35.543]  People understand that the trendiness that the system hasn't delivered.
[01:37:35.543 --> 01:37:37.864]  They're ready to come out of Egypt.
[01:37:37.864 --> 01:37:38.364]  They're ready.
[01:37:39.224 --> 01:37:50.111]  We have to go, as you said, and have sit-ins at Boehner and other traders' offices until they begin the impeachment hearings of Obama for this outrageous gun grab and the borders being wide open.
[01:37:50.111 --> 01:37:58.697]  We have to understand that we've sat back and been lazy for so long, thinking that, oh, America will just go on forever, there's so much prosperity.
[01:37:58.697 --> 01:37:59.898]  But that's not the case now.
[01:38:00.638 --> 01:38:10.885]  We have the baubles, the trinkets, the signets of wealth, but the spirit of freedom that helped generate all this wealth is dying right now at so many levels.
[01:38:10.885 --> 01:38:13.406]  It's also being rekindled at so many levels.
[01:38:13.406 --> 01:38:17.469]  So it's a minute-by-minute, second-by-second battle that we're involved in.
[01:38:17.469 --> 01:38:21.091]  We've got to have sit-ins at their home offices of the Congress people.
[01:38:21.091 --> 01:38:22.392]  We've got to get aggressive.
[01:38:22.392 --> 01:38:24.574]  We've got to go out and protest the ATF offices.
[01:38:25.395 --> 01:38:26.196]  We've got to go.
[01:38:26.196 --> 01:38:27.198]  I've done that before.
[01:38:27.198 --> 01:38:28.921]  We've got to have rallies at capitals.
[01:38:28.921 --> 01:38:30.965]  We've got to call the media.
[01:38:30.965 --> 01:38:33.049]  We've got to get aggressive.
[01:38:33.049 --> 01:38:34.812]  And we've got to also say, look!
[01:38:35.799 --> 01:38:37.460]  We're not backing down.
[01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:39.620]  We're not turning our guns in.
[01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:41.761]  If you want them, come and take them.
[01:38:41.761 --> 01:38:49.283]  And then we have to know if the enemy, the minute they bomb a federal building, we've got to drive there, whoever's closest, and videotape.
[01:38:49.283 --> 01:38:55.505]  The globalists are so obvious, they'll probably be walking around putting bomb casings in the back of their ATF vehicles like last time.
[01:38:55.805 --> 01:39:02.811]  I mean, the ATF was just loading the bombs with the FBI and staying in the hotels in front of everybody and people say, what are you doing in Oklahoma City?
[01:39:02.811 --> 01:39:07.115]  And they'd say, oh, we're doing telephone work, putting big gray sticks of butter in the walls.
[01:39:07.115 --> 01:39:09.417]  I mean, wiring a building takes weeks.
[01:39:09.417 --> 01:39:14.602]  And, you know, there's all these, quote, handsome guys, you know, I've had the witnesses on, Jane Graham and others.
[01:39:15.702 --> 01:39:18.324]  I guess they are kind of handsome hardcore killers.
[01:39:18.324 --> 01:39:22.047]  German intelligence was there, you name it, loading up the building with bombs.
[01:39:22.047 --> 01:39:24.769]  Next time you see that, start videotaping!
[01:39:24.769 --> 01:39:26.250]  We are the HUMET!
[01:39:26.250 --> 01:39:32.475]  Just because we don't wear black suits and have sunglasses and talk into our sleeves, we are the real intelligence agency of 1776!
[01:39:34.196 --> 01:39:40.317]  Okay, we gotta have our cameras, have our phones, heads up, and be tracking enemy operations everywhere.
[01:39:40.317 --> 01:39:42.338]  We see something, we say something.
[01:39:42.338 --> 01:39:46.478]  Just like Kurt Haskell exposed the government did the underwear bombing.
[01:39:46.478 --> 01:39:48.259]  He was later confirmed to be accurate.
[01:39:48.259 --> 01:39:53.220]  Our listener knew what to look for, and he was there, and he blew their operation wide open.
[01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:54.740]  That's what scares the enemy.
[01:39:54.740 --> 01:39:56.440]  Our people are everywhere.
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:59.261]  That's why they want to start shutting down internet freedom before
[01:40:00.242 --> 01:40:01.644]  They bring in the real tyranny.
[01:40:01.644 --> 01:40:02.425]  Well, guess what?
[01:40:02.425 --> 01:40:04.127]  You're not going to stop the signal.
[01:40:04.127 --> 01:40:09.914]  Our people are everywhere, including in the police agencies and the military, and that's what scares them.
[01:40:09.914 --> 01:40:14.599]  I'm going right back to calls, but David Knight, I want to get a two-minute response from you on that rant.
[01:40:14.599 --> 01:40:15.781]  I think you're absolutely right, Alex.
[01:40:15.781 --> 01:40:18.204]  I think we need to have a grassroots empowerment.
[01:40:18.204 --> 01:40:18.864]  They understand.
[01:40:19.525 --> 01:40:23.347]  That it's very empowering for people to have weapons to protect themselves.
[01:40:23.347 --> 01:40:28.511]  But the way we typically see it is in Hollywood, where they portray it as criminally dangerous.
[01:40:28.511 --> 01:40:31.393]  And so people need to experience that, as you point out.
[01:40:31.393 --> 01:40:37.116]  But I think that as far as a legal framework, I don't think we're going to get anything from our people in the federal government.
[01:40:37.116 --> 01:40:39.418]  I think it's going to have to come at the state level.
[01:40:39.418 --> 01:40:42.820]  With state nullification, it's going to have to come with jury nullification.
[01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:57.587]  People refusing to convict their fellow citizens for things that are not legitimate laws because they violate the Constitution, and people standing up and asserting their freedom in the states, just as they have with the legalization of marijuana.
[01:40:57.587 --> 01:41:07.853]  They have stood directly against the federal government's mandates as far as marijuana, and that is standing, because they first won the hearts and minds and the understanding of the people on marijuana.
[01:41:08.473 --> 01:41:14.778]  And they understand that it can be used medically, and they understand that it's being abused, and so they're shutting down the federal government.
[01:41:14.778 --> 01:41:21.944]  We need to understand that just like the war on drugs, the ammunition war is coming from the United Nations.
[01:41:21.944 --> 01:41:24.306]  They enact these agendas, the U.S.
[01:41:24.306 --> 01:41:28.289]  signs onto the treaty, and then ten years later we had the war on drugs begin.
[01:41:29.853 --> 01:41:30.353]  Exactly.
[01:41:30.353 --> 01:41:32.716]  We do timelines for people on the nightly news.
[01:41:32.716 --> 01:41:38.742]  I know we all know this, our listeners know it, but it's always about the new viewer who we're really targeting, the new listener, to try to free their minds.
[01:41:38.742 --> 01:41:42.045]  We're in a war for hearts and minds here, people.
[01:41:42.045 --> 01:41:43.586]  I just got chills.
[01:41:43.586 --> 01:41:44.647]  This is so epic.
[01:41:44.647 --> 01:41:45.668]  We need to explain to people
[01:41:46.309 --> 01:41:47.990]  They signed that U.N.
[01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:58.734]  treaty December 24th and all hell broke loose, even though Congress and Senators, what was it, 30-something Senators, sent a letter to Obama threatening him with impeachment hearings if he signed that treaty.
[01:41:58.734 --> 01:41:59.834]  Well, he did it!
[01:41:59.834 --> 01:42:01.775]  We never hold him accountable.
[01:42:02.967 --> 01:42:07.051]  Because so much of Congress has paid off, or they're blackmailed, and they're scared!
[01:42:07.051 --> 01:42:08.392]  They're scared!
[01:42:08.392 --> 01:42:14.077]  I mean, they put... Mr. Sousa is in prison right now, folks, for making a movie, basically.
[01:42:14.077 --> 01:42:15.839]  I mean, these people do not play games.
[01:42:15.839 --> 01:42:17.400]  People are like, yeah, Alex, they may get you.
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:18.821]  Well, they may!
[01:42:18.821 --> 01:42:21.203]  But, I mean, come on!
[01:42:21.203 --> 01:42:22.905]  We're fighting for the homeland.
[01:42:22.905 --> 01:42:23.505]  We're here.
[01:42:23.505 --> 01:42:24.867]  This is the Republic.
[01:42:24.867 --> 01:42:25.667]  This is real.
[01:42:26.508 --> 01:42:28.789]  This is 21st century warfare, folks.
[01:42:28.789 --> 01:42:32.509]  This is your chance to defend the Republic against a takeover.
[01:42:32.509 --> 01:42:36.810]  And I know there's ESPN and, you know, other stuff to do, but this is real.
[01:42:36.810 --> 01:42:38.411]  We're being usurped.
[01:42:38.411 --> 01:42:42.392]  And when they usurp the public, they want the 320 million Americans.
[01:42:42.392 --> 01:42:44.292]  They want you as their slaves.
[01:42:44.292 --> 01:42:45.333]  You understand that?
[01:42:45.333 --> 01:42:46.533]  This is a criminal energy.
[01:42:46.533 --> 01:42:48.513]  All right, I'm going to race through calls now.
[01:42:48.513 --> 01:42:51.014]  Let's go to who's up next here.
[01:42:51.014 --> 01:42:54.195]  Let's talk to Chris in Minnesota.
[01:42:54.195 --> 01:42:54.775]  You're on the air.
[01:42:54.775 --> 01:42:55.295]  Thanks for holding.
[01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:02.061]  Okay, do we have that caller, guys?
[01:43:02.061 --> 01:43:04.281]  Chris, go ahead.
[01:43:04.281 --> 01:43:05.862]  Okay, he's not responding.
[01:43:05.862 --> 01:43:07.642]  We'll let Chris in Minnesota go.
[01:43:07.642 --> 01:43:11.704]  We'll shift gears now and we'll go to Michael in Wyoming.
[01:43:11.704 --> 01:43:14.824]  Michael in Wyoming, you're on the air.
[01:43:14.824 --> 01:43:16.885]  Yes, hi Alex.
[01:43:16.885 --> 01:43:22.407]  Hi, and my call is, can the network feed me our audio just for the callers?
[01:43:22.407 --> 01:43:24.267]  Go ahead.
[01:43:24.267 --> 01:43:25.768]  Yes, Alex, can you hear me?
[01:43:25.768 --> 01:43:26.148]  Yes, I can.
[01:43:27.355 --> 01:43:28.956]  Okay.
[01:43:28.956 --> 01:43:30.997]  People need to understand the game we're playing here.
[01:43:30.997 --> 01:43:52.069]  Back in 1933, and I'll refer you to Representative Jim Traffickin's comments for the Congressional Record that he made back in 1993 regarding the bankruptcy of this country back in 33, and we've been operated as a dictatorship, essentially under martial law, ever since then.
[01:43:52.069 --> 01:43:55.511]  The Constitution... That's the Looper Palace Act of 1933 when Roosevelt took over.
[01:43:56.397 --> 01:44:05.562]  Yeah, and they've continued to create phony emergencies year after year to keep that going on in perpetuity.
[01:44:05.562 --> 01:44:14.626]  So, you know, if it appears that they're trashing the Constitution, as I was listening to Dave yesterday and you today, folks, there is no Constitution.
[01:44:14.626 --> 01:44:19.629]  As Bush said, it's a GD piece of paper, and in their minds, it's history.
[01:44:19.629 --> 01:44:23.331]  They're going into collecting mode, as in the IRS.
[01:44:24.391 --> 01:44:28.532]  Uh, to collect what they consider to be a bankrupt nation.
[01:44:28.532 --> 01:44:34.653]  And, uh, basically they see you as slaves of the corporatized government.
[01:44:34.653 --> 01:44:46.376]  So, uh, and the only law that really is in effect now is commercial law, since every one of these, uh, agencies from the EPA down to your local county sheriff and the
[01:44:47.524 --> 01:44:52.869]  Uh, your local courts are all corporations listed on Dun and Bradstreet.
[01:44:52.869 --> 01:44:55.791]  That is absolutely true.
[01:44:55.791 --> 01:45:03.877]  What you just said, and of course Michael's been calling for 15 years or so, he's a medical doctor, really smart guy involved in the Republican Party and stuff.
[01:45:03.877 --> 01:45:05.058]  Let me try to break down...
[01:45:06.039 --> 01:45:08.120]  And expand on what you're saying.
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:12.142]  It's true that they declared the War Powers Act and brought us under that in 1933.
[01:45:12.142 --> 01:45:14.003]  That proclamation's public.
[01:45:14.003 --> 01:45:17.945]  That's why they declare an emergency every year in Congress to supersede the Constitution.
[01:45:17.945 --> 01:45:21.786]  That's how they tell the Congressman, you can do this because of the emergency.
[01:45:21.786 --> 01:45:27.189]  But there's still force of will and force of law and force du jour.
[01:45:27.189 --> 01:45:29.890]  So they started building with 1913 and the 1933, the full takeover, this illegal beachhead.
[01:45:34.738 --> 01:45:38.199]  But it is a fraudulent contract, so we can declare it fraudulent.
[01:45:38.199 --> 01:45:43.860]  There was still the old republic, the old constitution, the old rights were still in operation by practice.
[01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:46.241]  And possession is nine-tenths of the law.
[01:45:46.241 --> 01:45:57.423]  And so our refusal to turn in guns, our refusal to register wells, our refusal to register when we have farmers markets, our refusal at the grassroots to not comply, which is now about survival.
[01:45:57.423 --> 01:46:01.244]  Not complying with tyranny is obedience to God, to paraphrase George Washington.
[01:46:01.804 --> 01:46:04.765]  And so, there was a parallel republic still there.
[01:46:04.765 --> 01:46:10.707]  For now, 80 years, they've been, or really 100 with the Federal Reserve, they've been dismantling the old republic.
[01:46:10.707 --> 01:46:13.828]  Now they're busy cutting down the last pieces.
[01:46:13.828 --> 01:46:21.170]  So now we're going to see a real dictatorship of foreign banks pressing in against us.
[01:46:21.170 --> 01:46:23.571]  So Michael, give me your take on that, then I want David Knight's response.
[01:46:24.795 --> 01:46:26.195]  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[01:46:26.195 --> 01:46:36.819]  You can still obtain your sovereign status, and I know that's a little hackneyed at this point, but it's true, even in this corporatized world that we live in.
[01:46:36.819 --> 01:46:38.219]  Let me recommend two books.
[01:46:38.219 --> 01:46:42.520]  They're real short, and they're just packed with information.
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:46.841]  They're both put out by the nationallibertyalliance.org.
[01:46:46.841 --> 01:46:48.562]  One is called the UCC Connection
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:50.641]  Tell the system who you are.
[01:47:12.557 --> 01:47:19.682]  And it's all real, but so many people do it without properly studying or don't do it right.
[01:47:19.682 --> 01:47:23.285]  There's so much bad advice, and the system tends to try to ignore it.
[01:47:23.285 --> 01:47:28.269]  But if you do it right, pro se litigants are having better effect.
[01:47:28.269 --> 01:47:32.772]  Some of my folks I know are having better effect against the feds with it than through with lawyers.
[01:47:32.772 --> 01:47:37.296]  And when you get top lawyers, you actually get people that actually do this themselves.
[01:47:37.296 --> 01:47:38.116]  I mean, I've seen lawyers.
[01:47:39.156 --> 01:47:47.661]  Stick letters under the courthouse door and refuse to even go in the courtroom and do things that I heard from the Patriots 20 years ago.
[01:47:47.661 --> 01:47:53.585]  So it's absolutely real and everything's being phased into admiralty law under administrative law.
[01:47:53.585 --> 01:47:57.787]  And I've seen in UN documents, court rulings where they're taking people's land and stuff.
[01:47:57.787 --> 01:48:02.010]  They actually declare admiralty and war powers under 1933.
[01:48:02.010 --> 01:48:06.713]  So it's just so incredible how many judges and people know all this.
[01:48:07.373 --> 01:48:08.993]  And it is a criminal conspiracy.
[01:48:25.618 --> 01:48:29.041]  People need to understand, the public needs to understand this disconnect.
[01:48:29.041 --> 01:48:32.244]  These people who come in, they are not elected king.
[01:48:32.244 --> 01:48:34.846]  They are merely stewards under the Constitution.
[01:48:34.846 --> 01:48:36.808]  That's what they're publicly telling everybody.
[01:48:36.808 --> 01:48:40.731]  That we're going to be, we're under the Constitution, we're taking an oath to it.
[01:48:40.731 --> 01:48:45.235]  That's how they assert their just authority, and many of them believe that they are doing that.
[01:48:45.695 --> 01:48:47.597]  We need to point out where they're wrong about that.
[01:48:47.597 --> 01:48:56.584]  Just like with the Lord of the Rings, the analogy that the king has been replaced by this steward who now wants to keep himself and his progeny permanently entrenched as the king.
[01:48:56.584 --> 01:48:57.945]  That's what the return of the king was about.
[01:48:57.945 --> 01:49:01.888]  Throwing this guy out who is the unfaithful steward who usurped the authority.
[01:49:01.888 --> 01:49:10.875]  People can understand what the caller was just talking about, but first they need to understand that this is an illegitimate government saying they derive their power from the Constitution.
[01:49:11.155 --> 01:49:15.719]  We are going to restore the Constitution just as the king was restored in Lord of the Rings.
[01:49:15.719 --> 01:49:18.022]  We're going to put the rightful king back.
[01:49:18.022 --> 01:49:23.867]  That's right, and that's we the people under God, not under the state, not under a permanent dictatorship.
[01:49:23.867 --> 01:49:33.596]  Because, you know, it says Romans 13, well, even if you take the fake extrapolation that modern churches do, like Hitler did, and say submit to government, well, our government is for, of, and by the people.
[01:49:33.596 --> 01:49:35.778]  So when you violate the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,
[01:49:36.658 --> 01:49:37.198]  I don't know.
[01:49:50.834 --> 01:50:07.504]  They did create a parallel system for themselves to operate and a parallel system of law going back to basically Roman ship law, Roman commerce law is the globalist duplicate that the British were following that they've kind of segued us on to.
[01:50:07.504 --> 01:50:09.705]  It's actually even older than our law.
[01:50:09.705 --> 01:50:11.106]  Yeah, I understand.
[01:50:11.106 --> 01:50:14.008]  But it's only for people that aren't slaves who are part of the establishment.
[01:50:14.588 --> 01:50:21.653]  I understand, but there's a public document out there, a constitution that lays out how we would like to see the government run.
[01:50:21.653 --> 01:50:23.475]  They swear that they have allegiance to it.
[01:50:23.475 --> 01:50:25.816]  That's where they say they get their power from it.
[01:50:25.816 --> 01:50:29.599]  So we need to hold that up and we need to say, this is how the constitution works.
[01:50:29.599 --> 01:50:32.221]  These people are frauds.
[01:50:32.221 --> 01:50:33.082]  Let's come back and flesh that.
[01:50:33.082 --> 01:50:34.603]  What I'm saying is, I understand.
[01:50:34.603 --> 01:50:37.045]  I'm saying they're parallel fraud.
[01:50:37.045 --> 01:50:37.265]  Right.
[01:50:37.265 --> 01:50:37.785]  Okay.
[01:50:37.785 --> 01:50:38.306]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:50:38.916 --> 01:50:44.888]  They say they get their authority from the Constitution, so yes, they are under that, even if they want to try to jump back and forth and play games.
[01:50:44.888 --> 01:50:45.970]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:51:31.917 --> 01:51:34.677]  But surviving is not recreation.
[01:51:34.677 --> 01:51:37.437]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[01:52:58.351 --> 01:53:02.172]  Last year, in the Nevada desert, one family took a stand for freedom.
[01:53:02.172 --> 01:53:06.673]  Numana Food Storage was the first and only company to support the rights of the Bundys.
[01:53:06.673 --> 01:53:13.115]  While others stood down, Numana took donations and provided storable foods to the men at Bunkerville.

[01:53:40.285 --> 01:53:45.167]  It's incredibly strong, long-lasting, and it can be quickly put up or taken down.
[01:53:45.167 --> 01:53:48.089]  It is also ideal when used as an emergency shelter.

[01:54:12.242 --> 01:54:14.844]  There's a lot of other news that we haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:54:14.844 --> 01:54:16.866]  Alex Jones here back live coming to you from the road.
[01:54:16.866 --> 01:54:24.714]  David Knight is co-hosting with me, doing a great job there in Austin, Texas at the InfoWars.com News Center.
[01:54:24.714 --> 01:54:25.795]  Coming up, Top G.O.
[01:54:25.795 --> 01:54:31.881]  Pierce says it's time to dissolve the ATF, but take the agency and basically put it under the DEA.
[01:54:31.881 --> 01:54:33.183]  Careful what you wish for.
[01:54:34.634 --> 01:54:35.314]  Also, U.S.
[01:54:35.314 --> 01:54:40.135]  sends heavily armored groups to Baltic states to deter Russia.
[01:54:40.135 --> 01:54:40.955]  That's AFP.
[01:54:40.955 --> 01:54:43.176]  This is escalating very, very quickly.
[01:54:43.176 --> 01:54:49.417]  We'll get into the latest with the Iran deal and a bunch of other news that I haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:54:49.417 --> 01:54:58.819]  And then, at about 40 after the debut of Rex Jones, I mean, you've seen a few of the reports he's done without releasing his name over the years or without showing his face.
[01:54:58.819 --> 01:55:00.980]  But I tell you, I was not involved in this production.
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:08.865]  Uh, Rex pretty much directed it with his cousin, my first cousin, Buckley Hammond, who's been working in the offices for 20 years.
[01:55:08.865 --> 01:55:11.646]  Actually, Buckley's been working with us since before I ever started InfoWars.
[01:55:11.646 --> 01:55:14.588]  He helped me launch it, and then he was gone for 12 years and just came back.
[01:55:14.588 --> 01:55:17.930]  But Rex pretty much wrote and directed this.
[01:55:17.930 --> 01:55:19.671]  It comes off, it's a really good report.
[01:55:19.671 --> 01:55:21.833]  It comes off pretty mainstream-y, though.
[01:55:21.833 --> 01:55:22.653]  Very news-y.
[01:55:22.653 --> 01:55:24.274]  It shows both sides of it.
[01:55:24.274 --> 01:55:26.376]  I wanted to just see what my 12-year-old son would do.
[01:55:27.456 --> 01:55:27.696]  I don't know.
[01:55:47.635 --> 01:55:47.895]  I don't
[01:56:10.343 --> 01:56:10.684]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:26.844 --> 01:56:31.927]  And Jason, and Robert, and Gerald, and Rob, and others here.
[01:56:31.927 --> 01:56:33.829]  Bam, bam, bam, quick comments.
[01:56:33.829 --> 01:56:36.530]  Briefly, we are Lizard Supported.
[01:56:36.530 --> 01:56:44.996]  We're going to sell out of the Ancient Defense because we're giving a free bottle of that high-quality product when you purchase two bottles of the X2 Nation Iodine and stock up on that.
[01:56:46.056 --> 01:56:49.758]  And we are also selling out of that very, very quickly.
[01:56:49.758 --> 01:56:51.339]  Probably a few days left of that.
[01:56:51.339 --> 01:56:58.083]  Infowarslife.com and your purchase does fund the operation in our defense of the unborn, the defense of the Second Amendment.
[01:56:58.083 --> 01:57:01.445]  It's very important to support us, and I know you are, so God bless you.
[01:57:01.445 --> 01:57:12.972]  And DNA Force, we have low-end stuff that's super high quality, like Ancient Defense, that's $14.95 because the ingredients aren't very expensive, so we can give you a really good price on high-quality organic stuff that's known to boost immunity.
[01:57:13.812 --> 01:57:17.893]  But then we've got the super high-end, where it was $150-something bucks.
[01:57:17.893 --> 01:57:21.174]  Leading competitors are $300 to $600 for something similar.
[01:57:21.174 --> 01:57:26.655]  So this is a Rolls-Royce or Ferrari product at a Ford Explorer price.
[01:57:26.655 --> 01:57:27.976]  Still high quality.
[01:57:27.976 --> 01:57:30.356]  Well, we slashed prices down.
[01:57:30.356 --> 01:57:33.277]  First it was $150-something, then to $130-something.
[01:57:33.277 --> 01:57:34.437]  It was getting close to selling out.
[01:57:34.437 --> 01:57:35.537]  It's a very popular product.
[01:57:35.537 --> 01:57:36.558]  One of our best sellers.
[01:57:36.558 --> 01:57:37.438]  Helps fund the operation.
[01:57:38.078 --> 01:57:42.105]  My dad had an idea with Dr. Group to put out something that was just Rolls-Royce level.
[01:57:42.105 --> 01:57:42.505]  We did it.
[01:57:42.505 --> 01:57:43.547]  It's been very popular.
[01:57:43.547 --> 01:57:45.410]  It's now 90, what is it today?
[01:57:45.410 --> 01:57:47.533]  90, because I came up with this last week, 94.
[01:57:50.274 --> 01:57:57.356]  47, 30% off the already discounted price to try out a bottle of DNA Force and see what it does for you and the small profit we make.
[01:57:57.356 --> 01:58:00.596]  Because one ingredient in here is like 50 bucks.
[01:58:00.596 --> 01:58:02.597]  One ingredient we added to this is like 50 bucks a bottle.
[01:58:02.597 --> 01:58:12.039]  Gentlemen, just to give you an idea, I mean, this is just, just, the people that manufacture this for us, one of the most fancy, you know, best places in the country, said they've never seen anybody do something like this.
[01:58:12.919 --> 01:58:14.780]  They just said it is over.
[01:58:14.780 --> 01:58:19.642]  People go to clinics, basically, richy rich folks, to get stuff like this for 600 bucks a month.
[01:58:19.642 --> 01:58:20.162]  Okay?
[01:58:20.162 --> 01:58:20.742]  Similar things.
[01:58:20.742 --> 01:58:26.105]  I mean, I gotta buy this stuff from, you know, Japanese Mitsubishi in the U.S.
[01:58:26.105 --> 01:58:27.205]  in huge labs.
[01:58:27.205 --> 01:58:28.446]  That's just one of the ingredients.
[01:58:28.446 --> 01:58:28.906]  $12,000 a kilo.
[01:58:28.906 --> 01:58:30.187]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:58:30.187 --> 01:58:30.907]  Get your DNA force.

[01:59:22.687 --> 01:59:26.969]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:59:26.969 --> 01:59:28.750]  Can you put two and two together?

[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:06.302]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.302 --> 02:00:08.064]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.064 --> 02:00:09.827]  Government cover-ups.

[02:00:12.972 --> 02:00:17.158]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.158 --> 02:00:21.223]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.056 --> 02:00:27.117]  Most people kind of punch out a reality because it's too hardcore.
[02:00:27.117 --> 02:00:27.497]  Not me.
[02:00:27.497 --> 02:00:28.317]  I love it.
[02:00:28.317 --> 02:00:29.977]  I love the Animating Contest of Liberty.
[02:00:29.977 --> 02:00:32.437]  I love being in the arena.
[02:00:32.437 --> 02:00:34.738]  I love not being a spectator.
[02:00:34.738 --> 02:00:36.438]  And life is epic.
[02:00:36.438 --> 02:00:40.099]  Tomorrow I'll be live with David Knight, co-hosting.
[02:00:40.099 --> 02:00:46.120]  And we're gonna, unless there's a huge event, which I'm sure there probably will be the way stuff works these days, be covering news.
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:47.840]  But talk about what's epic about life.
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:48.600]  What's positive.
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:49.941]  What's worth defending.
[02:00:49.941 --> 02:00:50.981]  What's good about humanity.
[02:00:50.981 --> 02:00:51.941]  Who your heroes are.
[02:00:52.887 --> 02:00:55.748]  I want to talk about, you know, empowering the human spirit.
[02:00:55.748 --> 02:00:57.868]  The Globos are all about suppressing it.
[02:00:57.868 --> 02:01:00.149]  I'm not negative when I bring up all this bad news.
[02:01:00.149 --> 02:01:01.689]  I want to fix it.
[02:01:01.689 --> 02:01:03.490]  Let's go to your phone calls right now.
[02:01:03.490 --> 02:01:04.350]  Mark in Oregon.
[02:01:04.350 --> 02:01:07.071]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:01:07.071 --> 02:01:07.651]  Hi, Alex.
[02:01:07.651 --> 02:01:09.011]  Hi, David.
[02:01:09.011 --> 02:01:11.972]  Actually, Alex, you had mentioned a handful of aces that we've got.
[02:01:11.972 --> 02:01:15.613]  I really just see one ace in our hand, and that is the people.
[02:01:16.737 --> 02:01:23.785]  There's a lot of construction that's already been completed as far as informing those who will listen over the years.
[02:01:23.785 --> 02:01:27.088]  You've pretty much been at the head of that, Alex.
[02:01:27.088 --> 02:01:29.291]  I would say that we only have one ace.
[02:01:29.291 --> 02:01:30.472]  It's an ace of spades.
[02:01:30.472 --> 02:01:31.193]  It can't fail.
[02:01:32.305 --> 02:01:35.748]  And that is simply that we take it out into the public.
[02:01:35.748 --> 02:01:43.655]  While we've been talking, you've been talking to us, others have, other broadcasters, we've been talking to others, they've been walking.
[02:01:43.655 --> 02:01:50.961]  And they're making a whole lot of progress, and it's time for the talking to stop as far as the private quarters go or the broadcast ways.
[02:01:50.961 --> 02:01:58.708]  Need to get out there in public, need to get out and have what I call seminar days, and combine it with a recall petition effort.
[02:01:59.835 --> 02:02:00.776]  I agree.
[02:02:00.776 --> 02:02:02.758]  Boehner should be recalled.
[02:02:02.758 --> 02:02:04.599]  He should be removed as Speaker.
[02:02:04.599 --> 02:02:10.364]  But if they're too cowardly to do it, we need to start recalling him in his home state.
[02:02:10.364 --> 02:02:12.085]  The NRA needs to do what Bloomberg.
[02:02:12.085 --> 02:02:25.256]  Bloomberg spent hundreds of millions of dollars just the last few years, hundreds of millions, getting matching funds from Bill Gates and others and Warren Buffett, on record, to go and try to unseat good sheriffs and good members of legislatures and members of Congress.
[02:02:25.256 --> 02:02:26.317]  Where is the NRA?
[02:02:26.317 --> 02:02:27.277]  They need to give
[02:02:28.458 --> 02:02:28.979]  $20 million.
[02:02:28.979 --> 02:02:34.524]  I mean, if they asked for it, they'd get it right now from their 5 million members or whatever it is.
[02:02:34.524 --> 02:02:36.325]  You know, ask for $5 from each one of them.
[02:02:36.325 --> 02:02:41.530]  They'd have the money they need to go give $20 million for a recall of Boehner and remove him.
[02:02:41.530 --> 02:02:44.032]  Remove that piece of trash.
[02:02:44.032 --> 02:02:45.173]  That's a great point.
[02:02:45.173 --> 02:02:46.134]  Thanks for the call.
[02:02:46.134 --> 02:02:47.475]  Let's get David Knight's take on that.
[02:02:48.095 --> 02:02:48.735]  Absolutely, Alex.
[02:02:48.735 --> 02:02:50.416]  I think it needs to be shut down from the outside.
[02:02:50.416 --> 02:02:52.257]  I think Washington is too corrupt.
[02:02:52.257 --> 02:02:56.359]  One of the best ways to do it is to call him back from the state level.
[02:02:56.359 --> 02:03:00.281]  We've seen that happen when they've passed regulations out west.
[02:03:00.281 --> 02:03:02.082]  We see the gun control regulations.
[02:03:02.082 --> 02:03:07.925]  We had legislators that were recalled out in, what was it, Colorado, I believe it was.
[02:03:07.925 --> 02:03:10.827]  California recalled Governor Davis.
[02:03:12.129 --> 02:03:15.051]  I mean, he was nothing compared to Boehner and the Republicans now.
[02:03:15.051 --> 02:03:18.393]  I mean, hardcore commies are nothing compared to these people.
[02:03:18.393 --> 02:03:19.313]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:03:19.313 --> 02:03:22.915]  I still think what we need to do is we need to use state nullification.
[02:03:22.915 --> 02:03:24.516]  We need to use jury nullification.
[02:03:24.516 --> 02:03:28.018]  People need to understand the legal constitutional framework for that.
[02:03:28.018 --> 02:03:31.540]  They say that they are swearing allegiance to the Constitution.
[02:03:31.540 --> 02:03:32.901]  Let's let them prove it.
[02:03:32.901 --> 02:03:39.025]  Let's exercise the rights that we publicly have under state nullification and jury nullification to shut this thing down.
[02:03:39.025 --> 02:03:40.205]  And I see it happening.
[02:03:40.205 --> 02:03:40.966]  I see it happening.
[02:03:41.306 --> 02:03:45.728]  With the marijuana legislation that we see popping up in different states.
[02:03:45.728 --> 02:04:00.116]  And there's been proposals at state level that they should be able to allow, they should be able to manufacture firearms as well as ammunition within a state and that the federal government would not have any authority over that if it didn't cross state lines.
[02:04:00.116 --> 02:04:02.137]  That is how the Constitution was set up.
[02:04:02.137 --> 02:04:03.217]  We should assert that authority.
[02:04:03.217 --> 02:04:04.298]  We should make our own ammunition.
[02:04:04.298 --> 02:04:07.880]  If they're going to ban the ammunition, make ammunition inside Texas for Texans.
[02:04:09.090 --> 02:04:13.212]  Well, that's the way to do it, is innovation is what will defeat these people.
[02:04:13.212 --> 02:04:16.193]  Making art, making culture, they have a dead culture.
[02:04:16.193 --> 02:04:18.274]  The globalists are a corporate board.
[02:04:18.274 --> 02:04:27.418]  If we simply promote our culture, side by side with theirs, people will vote for our culture, just like the organics, the true hippie, true liberal movement, the good parts of it.
[02:04:28.018 --> 02:04:29.279]  Understand states' rights.
[02:04:29.279 --> 02:04:35.603]  They've used it to get a Trump card on organics, to get a Trump card on marijuana.
[02:04:35.603 --> 02:04:38.705]  It has a dark side, folks, but it's not a federal issue.
[02:04:38.705 --> 02:04:41.127]  And it's the people's right to do that.
[02:04:41.127 --> 02:04:48.632]  So now the left can't argue against us on internal currency, silver currency, state banks, Second Amendment, our own ammo.
[02:04:48.632 --> 02:04:49.352]  That's the way.
[02:04:49.352 --> 02:04:49.953]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:58.846 --> 02:05:02.348]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:05:02.348 --> 02:05:10.612]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[02:06:59.821 --> 02:07:04.805]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:07:04.805 --> 02:07:07.467]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:07:07.467 --> 02:07:14.512]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:07:14.512 --> 02:07:17.535]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:07:17.535 --> 02:07:20.457]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:07:20.457 --> 02:07:22.479]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:07:22.479 --> 02:07:25.341]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:07:25.401 --> 02:07:31.124]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:07:31.124 --> 02:07:34.626]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:07:34.626 --> 02:07:37.727]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[02:08:01.865 --> 02:08:08.513]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:08.513 --> 02:08:11.496]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:13.820 --> 02:08:15.181]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:15.181 --> 02:08:19.043]  I'm David Knight in Austin and joining us on the road is Alex Jones.
[02:08:19.043 --> 02:08:25.646]  And you know, Alex, we talked about this article is up on Drudge about them implanting memories and demise successfully.
[02:08:25.646 --> 02:08:29.207]  I think it's a great analogy for what's going on in the InfoWar.
[02:08:29.207 --> 02:08:31.689]  One of the things that they point out, they said they've been able to do...
[02:08:32.469 --> 02:08:36.873]  subconscious association while animals were sleeping in the past.
[02:08:36.873 --> 02:08:41.137]  This is the first time they've been able to plant a conscious memory into people.
[02:08:41.137 --> 02:08:52.327]  But think about how easy it is for them to do it to humans when we're asleep, when we're just passively accepting what they feed us in the news, in the media, in the television, in the movies that we watch.
[02:08:52.327 --> 02:08:56.872]  They can build all kinds of passive associations and it's very easy for them.
[02:08:56.872 --> 02:08:58.113]  And that's the line in Guardians.
[02:08:58.593 --> 02:08:58.833]  Sorry?
[02:08:58.833 --> 02:09:01.817]  And the stories on the London Guardian today from folks that just joined us.
[02:09:01.817 --> 02:09:05.583]  And then you've got the Attorney General saying, let's brainwash the public against guns.
[02:09:05.583 --> 02:09:11.090]  And we wonder why there's subliminals against Alex Jones, InfoWars, Drudge.
[02:09:11.090 --> 02:09:15.516]  I mean, we've shown people where we catch them with half-second long...
[02:09:16.537 --> 02:09:21.279]  Stuff that says Ron Paul is a meth head, you know, on Breaking Bad.
[02:09:21.279 --> 02:09:28.421]  Or Alex Jones is a kook that thinks, you know, they're building, you know, Elvis or Michael Jackson is at the space station.
[02:09:28.421 --> 02:09:32.643]  This is what they're doing, and folks, that's 101 subliminal programming.
[02:09:32.643 --> 02:09:37.104]  This is a all-out war, and the war has put people into a trance.
[02:09:37.104 --> 02:09:38.285]  They found in major studies.
[02:09:39.198 --> 02:09:44.262]  That the average person watches about five hours of TV above the age of 40 or so.
[02:09:44.262 --> 02:09:45.903]  People can pull these articles up.
[02:09:45.903 --> 02:09:48.364]  Speaking of that, it's in the Guardian.
[02:09:48.364 --> 02:09:54.028]  But people below that are watching up to 10 hours a day of some form of media or screen time.
[02:09:54.028 --> 02:09:58.011]  This is literally brain damaging the public, screwing up kids.
[02:09:58.011 --> 02:10:04.636]  Hundreds of pediatrics organizations and studies have come out saying, don't give your kids an iPad or iPod or Droid, period.
[02:10:05.427 --> 02:10:06.008]  Here's what's next!
[02:10:20.245 --> 02:10:27.130]  Alzheimer's TV viewing and it's they've known for 30 years neurological disorders are linked to watching TV.
[02:10:27.130 --> 02:10:30.692]  They can flash strobe lights.
[02:10:30.692 --> 02:10:36.877]  In fact, it's well known at raves that will put people into a trance.
[02:10:37.637 --> 02:10:39.057]  Without being on drugs.
[02:10:39.057 --> 02:10:42.318]  That's how widespread this technology is.
[02:10:42.318 --> 02:10:52.300]  And I was talking to a lady the other day who went to a rock concert, never had epilepsy, and they flashed the lights a certain way and a bunch of people, not just her, basically fell out having convulsions.
[02:10:52.300 --> 02:11:03.602]  Well, it's well known you can put a computer program, if you have the right light bank, to make a certain number of percentage people go into convulsions or into a mesmerized state where you can then program them
[02:11:04.142 --> 02:11:10.735]  If it's coming out of a television set with a carrier wave or messages directly to the subconscious that cannot be blocked.
[02:11:10.735 --> 02:11:11.918]  So we have these hypnotic...
[02:11:12.799 --> 02:11:14.080]  Triggers.
[02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:14.940]  This isn't me, folks.
[02:11:14.940 --> 02:11:18.362]  This is taught at the University of Texas Psychology Department 15 years ago.
[02:11:18.362 --> 02:11:24.286]  I was allowed in there and stuff and saw some secret DARPA stuff, or let's just say restricted, but that part wasn't even secret.
[02:11:24.286 --> 02:11:26.267]  This is what's taught 101.
[02:11:26.267 --> 02:11:28.328]  This is what's going on 101.
[02:11:28.328 --> 02:11:38.814]  This is the scientific takeover where everything is about dominating, engaging, and controlling humanity, and it's just being rolled out now to control everyone.
[02:11:38.814 --> 02:11:41.436]  Remember, must have been 20-something years ago,
[02:11:42.156 --> 02:11:45.320]  Thousands of children in Japan, thousands in the U.S.
[02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:49.365]  went into convulsions when Pokemon, when the eyes flashed.
[02:11:49.365 --> 02:11:51.909]  That's because they know the carrier wave.
[02:11:51.909 --> 02:11:54.752]  They're doing these as mass tests, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:11:54.752 --> 02:11:59.718]  We're not in Kansas anymore, and we know they're putting in vaccines with the troops.
[02:12:00.970 --> 02:12:02.352]  I'd cover this ten years ago.
[02:12:02.352 --> 02:12:05.055]  I'd cover it six years ago in videos like brain-eating vaccines.
[02:12:05.055 --> 02:12:07.458]  People didn't believe me, even when it was in the literature.
[02:12:07.458 --> 02:12:11.944]  Now it's like, oh, we're giving the troops shots that don't make them be upset anymore.
[02:12:11.944 --> 02:12:14.087]  Oh, then a lot of them commit suicide later.
[02:12:14.087 --> 02:12:18.152]  They say it's like they're not alive anymore, but they're not in pain anymore either.
[02:12:18.152 --> 02:12:18.913]  The vaccines...
[02:12:20.129 --> 02:12:27.459]  Go in and eat the receptors in the area of your brain associated with spiritual consciousness, higher brain waves.
[02:12:27.459 --> 02:12:32.846]  We are living in a science fiction movie, but we're not on the black hole spaceship.
[02:12:33.885 --> 02:12:45.728]  With Maximilian Schell, and the robots weren't good enough for him, so he digitally, with electricity, lobotomizes, with electroshock, the crew to be his slaves.
[02:12:45.728 --> 02:12:49.809]  They're already way past, you know, Disney movies like The Black Hole, folks.
[02:12:49.809 --> 02:12:51.150]  They don't need to do that.
[02:12:51.150 --> 02:12:52.330]  They can give you a shot.
[02:12:52.330 --> 02:12:53.550]  You'll still go to work.
[02:12:53.550 --> 02:12:54.830]  You'll do what you're told.
[02:12:54.830 --> 02:13:00.072]  You'll still be partially there, but the spiritual connection is severed.
[02:13:00.712 --> 02:13:02.213]  At least partially.
[02:13:02.213 --> 02:13:04.894]  I mean, it's already going on.
[02:13:04.894 --> 02:13:06.754]  It's already happening.
[02:13:06.754 --> 02:13:08.035]  And that's why I freak out.
[02:13:08.035 --> 02:13:13.537]  This is a normal response to someone who's not been put under a trance.
[02:13:13.537 --> 02:13:18.859]  I mean, people 100 years ago would act 10 times crazier than me if somebody tried to do something to their kids.
[02:13:18.859 --> 02:13:26.481]  If Jocelyn Elders got up 20 years ago and said, we're going to teach the little kids how to reach down and touch themselves and masturbate, it's a good thing.
[02:13:26.481 --> 02:13:27.902]  People would have flipped.
[02:13:28.462 --> 02:13:29.763]  Why are we so comfortable?
[02:13:29.763 --> 02:13:39.052]  Because with chemicals and drugs and flashing lights and subliminals and culture and our own laziness, they have put us into a trance.
[02:13:39.052 --> 02:13:40.773]  Break the trance, I'm telling you folks.
[02:13:41.832 --> 02:13:47.294]  Prayer has shown to take you, even if you're an atheist, to a higher level of consciousness.
[02:13:47.294 --> 02:13:58.978]  I'm telling you, even if you're an atheist, if you just pray to Jesus Christ to break your conditioning, to unlock your mind and your soul, and just invite Christ in, because it's a free will universe, and say, Christ, if you're real,
[02:14:00.018 --> 02:14:01.459]  Come into my life.
[02:14:01.459 --> 02:14:03.241]  Free my mind of this conditioning.
[02:14:03.241 --> 02:14:07.805]  Even if you don't believe that Christ is real, but that you're going to a higher level of your mind, I don't believe that's what's happening.
[02:14:07.805 --> 02:14:10.607]  At one level, it's there, but then God connects to that.
[02:14:10.607 --> 02:14:19.814]  If you just ask Christ to come into your heart, come into your soul, and show you the truth, and empower you, and open your mind, I'm telling you, if you say that with free will,
[02:14:20.715 --> 02:14:36.042]  God will give you a choice, but when the Holy Spirit, folks, comes to you and starts showing you this stuff, if you say, okay, God, I know you're real and I don't want you, that is the ultimate sin to reject the Spirit of Christ, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:36.042 --> 02:14:37.183]  And I'm just telling you it's real.
[02:14:37.183 --> 02:14:39.864]  If you want discernment, if you want real power,
[02:14:40.484 --> 02:14:44.449]  Christ is ready to give it to you, but you will then be under Christ's control.
[02:14:44.449 --> 02:14:53.659]  Doesn't mean my flesh isn't evil, doesn't mean I don't do bad things, but in my heart, in my soul, in my conscience, when I'm not doing the right thing, it's literally there.
[02:14:53.659 --> 02:14:55.901]  And you cannot then reject that spirit.
[02:14:55.901 --> 02:15:01.628]  So I'm telling you, if spirits are real, folks, if you will simply, and people say, oh, this is a bunch of mumbo-jumbo, do it!
[02:15:02.188 --> 02:15:04.730]  Prepare yourselves to break free of Satan.
[02:15:04.730 --> 02:15:09.314]  Prepare yourselves, ladies and gentlemen, to be able to see and come out of the Matrix.
[02:15:09.314 --> 02:15:16.500]  Ask Jesus Christ into your heart and pray that our leaders, like Saul of Tarsus, be struck with reality.
[02:15:16.500 --> 02:15:21.064]  I know there are some men in the system and women that aren't pure evil that can be turned to good.
[02:15:21.064 --> 02:15:23.626]  Pray that God move on them as well.
[02:15:23.626 --> 02:15:26.329]  Pray that God's Spirit move on the land.
[02:15:27.196 --> 02:15:29.677]  David Knight, I didn't mean to go off into that, but these are desperate times.
[02:15:29.677 --> 02:15:31.237]  I'm just telling folks where I really stand.
[02:15:31.237 --> 02:15:32.618]  David Knight, your take on that.
[02:15:32.618 --> 02:15:34.398]  Then we're going to go back to calls.
[02:15:34.398 --> 02:15:35.819]  Yeah, Alex, you're absolutely right.
[02:15:35.819 --> 02:15:37.739]  It's ultimately a spiritual battle.
[02:15:37.739 --> 02:15:40.660]  These things perpetuate over multiple generations.
[02:15:40.660 --> 02:15:42.941]  We know that it's accelerating right now.
[02:15:42.941 --> 02:15:47.502]  My wife read to me a very interesting testimony from the actor Denzel Washington.
[02:15:47.502 --> 02:15:52.184]  I would encourage people to take a look at what he said in terms of his encounters with God.
[02:15:52.184 --> 02:15:53.044]  Pull it up.
[02:15:53.044 --> 02:15:54.064]  I want to see some of that.
[02:15:54.064 --> 02:15:54.625]  The next segment.
[02:15:54.625 --> 02:15:54.945]  Pull it up.
[02:15:54.945 --> 02:15:55.345]  I want to see it.
[02:15:56.138 --> 02:16:03.961]  Yeah, I'm very, very concerned about what is going on in terms of, you're talking about chemical lobotomies that they're able to do.
[02:16:03.961 --> 02:16:08.803]  Of course, they did massive surgical lobotomies on veterans when they came back from World War II.
[02:16:08.803 --> 02:16:12.604]  There was a long series of abuse about that in the Wall Street Journal.
[02:16:12.604 --> 02:16:16.226]  But now they're moving beyond that to doing electronic lobotomies.
[02:16:16.226 --> 02:16:19.627]  And the things that they're able to do, people can't even understand.
[02:16:19.627 --> 02:16:21.988]  That's how asleep the public is.
[02:16:21.988 --> 02:16:25.009]  And that's what is so dangerous about this, is that when we're in kind of a
[02:16:25.669 --> 02:16:31.253]  Semi-conscious, not even paying attention, not really truly even physically sleeping, but just not paying attention.
[02:16:31.253 --> 02:16:36.137]  It's very easy for them to do these things to us subconsciously as well as consciously.
[02:16:36.137 --> 02:16:45.183]  When we look at these experiments that they're doing with the mouse brains, when we look at the brain initiative that Obama has put in, we talked about that and we talked about artificial intelligence.
[02:16:45.183 --> 02:16:46.284]  Yeah, it's very dangerous.
[02:16:47.585 --> 02:16:48.326]  Excellent points, David.
[02:16:48.326 --> 02:16:52.089]  I didn't mean to go off on a jag when you brought that up, but it's so incredibly important.
[02:16:52.089 --> 02:16:54.370]  In fact, they just pulled up the Denzel Washington clip.
[02:16:54.370 --> 02:16:57.933]  If we can get the audio of that, maybe we can play that later as well.
[02:16:57.933 --> 02:16:59.774]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[02:16:59.774 --> 02:17:01.536]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[02:17:01.536 --> 02:17:02.496]  Jason in Tennessee.
[02:17:02.496 --> 02:17:03.677]  God bless you for holding.
[02:17:03.677 --> 02:17:04.298]  You're on the air.
[02:17:04.298 --> 02:17:06.059]  Thank you.
[02:17:06.059 --> 02:17:06.719]  Thanks, guys.
[02:17:06.719 --> 02:17:08.080]  I'll be short.
[02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:14.445]  Alex, I really do believe that in the very end of this, we will have to take up arms.
[02:17:14.445 --> 02:17:15.486]  But in the meantime,
[02:17:16.348 --> 02:17:37.941]  What we have to do, and a group here in my little town in Tennessee, East Tennessee, we have gone to alerting the public of all the school board meetings, all the council meetings, and we regularly have, the rooms are full when they have those meetings, just to let these people know that we're watching you.
[02:17:37.941 --> 02:17:43.204]  We distribute flyers that tell what's going on in the town.
[02:17:43.204 --> 02:17:44.104]  We have actually
[02:17:45.700 --> 02:17:53.702]  Had a corrupt mayor that was kicked out because of the alertness that the people have taken on to be awakened.
[02:17:53.702 --> 02:17:59.104]  We have a lot of people that are still asleep, and we have got to wake these people up.
[02:17:59.104 --> 02:18:00.784]  We have to start with our young people.
[02:18:00.784 --> 02:18:13.008]  We have to turn these young people over to the truth about things, to get them away from this mesmerizing trance that they're in, to get them away from that, to show them what this country was like
[02:18:14.157 --> 02:18:21.099]  40, 50, 60, 70 years ago with the way it was that it could be like that again and even stronger, Alex.
[02:18:21.099 --> 02:18:23.480]  We can go and we can go to these meetings.
[02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:24.980]  We can look these people in the eye.
[02:18:24.980 --> 02:18:30.341]  We can stand there and never even say a word, but let them know that we are standing strong.
[02:18:30.341 --> 02:18:38.664]  We are watching you and we will do what it takes for you to do what you are supposed to do in this in this union.
[02:18:38.664 --> 02:18:39.224]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:18:39.895 --> 02:18:40.615]  God bless you, sir.
[02:18:40.615 --> 02:18:41.576]  Thanks for holding to say that.
[02:18:41.576 --> 02:18:43.497]  Very strong testimony.
[02:18:43.497 --> 02:18:45.558]  And give them literature.
[02:18:45.558 --> 02:18:48.199]  Talk to them.
[02:18:48.199 --> 02:18:49.480]  We have to make a noise.
[02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:55.002]  We have to act like chickens hop up and down when a weasel comes into the coop, and you can go out there and shoot the weasel.
[02:18:55.002 --> 02:18:56.363]  Well, we're a lot better than chickens, folks.
[02:18:56.363 --> 02:18:59.004]  We can at least hop around and squawk.
[02:18:59.004 --> 02:19:01.105]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[02:19:01.105 --> 02:19:03.386]  I mean, they just got rid of the borders, folks.
[02:19:03.386 --> 02:19:04.607]  David, take us out to break.
[02:19:04.607 --> 02:19:07.028]  I mean, what do you expect to happen next, David?
[02:19:07.028 --> 02:19:08.949]  The executive tax increases?
[02:19:09.807 --> 02:19:14.615]  Well Alex, you know, Petraeus said that we no longer have America, we now have North America.
[02:19:14.615 --> 02:19:24.811]  They're taking the mask off, they're showing people that the agreement that they passed 20 years ago, NAFTA, he even referred to NAFTA, they're showing people that that wasn't simply a trade agreement.
[02:19:25.331 --> 02:19:27.954]  It was something that directly affected our sovereignty.
[02:19:27.954 --> 02:19:29.275]  And now they're showing us that.
[02:19:29.275 --> 02:19:35.161]  And they're showing us that because they're going to the next level with this Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic partnership.
[02:19:35.161 --> 02:19:41.128]  And there's an article that we can talk about that's on New American where they say it's really kind of coming to a point now with that.
[02:19:41.128 --> 02:19:42.649]  That's the real danger, I think.
[02:19:42.649 --> 02:19:44.171]  But we defeat this at the local level.
[02:19:45.540 --> 02:19:46.862]  Well, we've got to just stop complying.
[02:19:46.862 --> 02:19:50.285]  I mean, they want to have these Pacific partnerships and other things making decisions here.
[02:19:50.285 --> 02:19:51.607]  They won't even let us see it.
[02:19:51.607 --> 02:19:52.428]  I mean, it's game over.
[02:19:52.428 --> 02:19:54.230]  No, it's not legitimate.
[02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:55.832]  Like, King George wasn't legitimate.
[02:19:55.832 --> 02:19:56.513]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:56.513 --> 02:19:57.514]  Stay with us.
[02:19:59.144 --> 02:20:02.425]  I'm really glad my buddy Mark turned me on to Guns80.com.
[02:20:02.425 --> 02:20:05.465]  I gotta tell ya, I didn't want to buy any more firearms.
[02:20:05.465 --> 02:20:08.526]  I didn't want a paperwork trail headed back to Big Brother.
[02:20:08.526 --> 02:20:10.606]  I want 100% privacy.
[02:20:10.606 --> 02:20:12.626]  I want to be an invisible gun owner.
[02:20:12.626 --> 02:20:13.326]  Hello?
[02:20:13.326 --> 02:20:18.187]  So Mark says, hey, you know, Guns80.com, Ghost AR-15.
[02:20:18.187 --> 02:20:19.527]  Ghost means invisible.
[02:20:19.527 --> 02:20:20.008]  Get it?
[02:20:20.008 --> 02:20:21.388]  Ghost AR-15.

[02:20:31.722 --> 02:20:40.607]  I was concerned about my cholesterol readings because I knew that high cholesterol is related to clogging of the arteries and increases the risk for heart attack and stroke.
[02:20:40.607 --> 02:20:46.790]  One day, I heard an ad for Heart and Body Extract and I was skeptical, but I decided to give it a try.
[02:20:46.790 --> 02:20:48.691]  Man, the numbers don't lie.

[02:21:58.492 --> 02:22:02.695]  As the new world order continues to tighten its grip on every facet of our lives.
[02:22:03.652 --> 02:22:08.075]  We're all asking ourselves, how can we maintain our independence?
[02:22:08.075 --> 02:22:09.636]  The answer is clear.
[02:22:09.636 --> 02:22:12.238]  Get prepared and you get prepared now.
[02:22:12.238 --> 02:22:15.701]  Now the only question left is where do we begin?
[02:22:15.701 --> 02:22:17.942]  My Patreon supply is here to help.

[02:22:48.186 --> 02:22:48.586]  Call right now!
[02:22:58.004 --> 02:23:04.746]  Usually the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[02:23:04.746 --> 02:23:09.127]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[02:23:09.127 --> 02:23:12.629]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[02:23:12.629 --> 02:23:13.769]  Not fun!
[02:23:13.769 --> 02:23:22.171]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[02:23:22.171 --> 02:23:26.933]  One World Whey is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[02:23:27.273 --> 02:23:28.434]  My name is Errol.

[02:23:29.974 --> 02:23:32.535]  You know, the taste of One World Whey is amazing.
[02:23:32.535 --> 02:23:40.399]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your trace mineral supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[02:23:40.399 --> 02:23:46.682]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.
[02:23:46.682 --> 02:23:47.182]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:23:47.182 --> 02:23:47.382]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:23:47.382 --> 02:23:48.463]  Or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[02:24:04.538 --> 02:24:05.433]  This is the end.
[02:24:11.391 --> 02:24:12.772]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:12.772 --> 02:24:13.772]  I'm David Knight in Austin.
[02:24:13.772 --> 02:24:16.393]  We're joined by Alex Jones on the road.
[02:24:16.393 --> 02:24:19.235]  And before we go back to Alex, I want to get his take on this.
[02:24:19.235 --> 02:24:21.816]  They're talking about the Apple Watch, which came out yesterday.
[02:24:21.816 --> 02:24:29.219]  One of the things they said about it was it's capable of displaying a barcode that will act as an airline boarding pass.
[02:24:29.219 --> 02:24:30.540]  Think about that image.
[02:24:30.540 --> 02:24:34.662]  A barcode on your wrist to allow you to travel.
[02:24:34.662 --> 02:24:35.902]  What does that conjure up?
[02:24:35.902 --> 02:24:38.184]  Does that sound like something out of a concentration camp?
[02:24:38.184 --> 02:24:38.844]  What do you think, Alex?
[02:24:39.858 --> 02:24:55.042]  Well, David, it's funny that you brought that up, because when you were talking about all this beast technology last segment, I was thinking about how they're going to make us have smartphones, smart devices, to travel and just live our lives.
[02:24:55.042 --> 02:24:56.123]  It's they're watching us.
[02:24:56.123 --> 02:25:05.286]  It's our little guardian demon that will track our heart rate, what we eat, what we do, how much we exercise, to carbon tax us and track everything we do.
[02:25:05.286 --> 02:25:06.546]  And this has all been announced
[02:25:07.771 --> 02:25:13.097]  Just as other big TV manufacturers now go, no, we're recording and watching everything you do.
[02:25:13.097 --> 02:25:22.148]  And all the smartphones, Lennon Telegraph came out last week, are in their terms of service, watching and listening to you physically, not just tracking the cookies.
[02:25:22.148 --> 02:25:24.470]  And so see, it makes everything we said passe.
[02:25:25.071 --> 02:25:28.132]  But we're still kooks because we said it first, see?
[02:25:28.132 --> 02:25:32.975]  It's like telling somebody where to strike gold, and then you strike gold, and then you spit in their face.
[02:25:32.975 --> 02:25:35.216]  Well, folks, we're right about all the rest of it, too.
[02:25:35.216 --> 02:25:36.256]  Believe me.
[02:25:36.256 --> 02:25:38.297]  We give you all the documentation.
[02:25:38.297 --> 02:25:40.058]  Why do you think the military is so awake?
[02:25:40.058 --> 02:25:48.101]  They're training them for nationwide cordoning of cities and gun confiscation, and their number one enemy is the gun owners, the veterans.
[02:25:48.101 --> 02:25:50.342]  They train to arrest veterans.
[02:25:50.342 --> 02:25:52.003]  They train to kill veterans.
[02:25:52.003 --> 02:25:53.544]  The military is freaking out.
[02:25:54.164 --> 02:26:04.616]  But it's like someone who can see a thousand miles from a mountaintop talking to amoebas that don't even know they're in a petri dish when the military tries to warn people.
[02:26:05.430 --> 02:26:07.051]  And so it's that disconnect.
[02:26:35.890 --> 02:26:48.099]  I mean, think about how over-the-top that is, that they've got all these secret Asia trade agreements, and we get one part of the document from WikiLeaks, and it's the total takeover of the Internet and free speech!
[02:26:48.099 --> 02:26:50.461]  It's SOPA and CISPA, and it's secret!
[02:26:50.461 --> 02:26:53.763]  We're under FCC regulation now, the entire Internet!
[02:26:53.763 --> 02:26:56.525]  Telecommunications, and they won't release it!
[02:26:56.525 --> 02:26:59.007]  Because they're making a dictatorial move!
[02:26:59.007 --> 02:27:01.609]  They've made the decision to go for a broke!
[02:27:01.609 --> 02:27:03.050]  They're coming after the bullets!
[02:27:03.050 --> 02:27:04.331]  They're coming after the guns!
[02:27:05.071 --> 02:27:09.952]  And I'm just here screaming bloody murder on the parapets saying enemies are climbing the gates!
[02:27:09.952 --> 02:27:13.593]  And then, what do you do when they shut us down?
[02:27:13.593 --> 02:27:14.893]  They're coming, folks.
[02:27:14.893 --> 02:27:15.793]  They're here.
[02:27:15.793 --> 02:27:17.554]  It isn't a game.
[02:27:17.554 --> 02:27:19.194]  And I'm not trying to get hyped up.
[02:27:19.194 --> 02:27:26.256]  It's every time I think about how epic this is, and how criminal this is, and how ridiculous it is, how over the top it is.
[02:27:26.256 --> 02:27:28.676]  I mean, I covered this Sunday.
[02:27:28.676 --> 02:27:30.837]  Mainstream US and British newspapers.
[02:27:31.835 --> 02:27:39.880]  Admitting that the vaccines were brain damaging people and admitting that glyphosates caused a five-fold increase in kidney failure.
[02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:42.042]  You wonder why dialysis places are popping up everywhere.
[02:27:42.042 --> 02:27:44.723]  And I mean, they're just murdering us!
[02:27:44.723 --> 02:27:45.764]  They're murdering us!
[02:27:45.764 --> 02:27:47.285]  They know they're murdering us!
[02:27:47.285 --> 02:27:48.326]  It's a sick joke!
[02:27:49.454 --> 02:27:52.816]  You know, it's interesting, Alex, when you're talking about vaccines, there was an interesting article.
[02:27:52.816 --> 02:27:55.638]  Guys, pull this up about the former Morrisville child.
[02:27:55.638 --> 02:27:58.860]  This is in North Carolina, just outside Charlotte.
[02:27:58.860 --> 02:28:02.983]  They're educating the public in this article about the vaccine court.
[02:28:02.983 --> 02:28:05.885]  Now, this is a child that was damaged by vaccines.
[02:28:06.645 --> 02:28:08.908]  She had encephalopathy, brain injury.
[02:28:08.908 --> 02:28:16.575]  They say she got $2,000,000 plus $250,000 a year for the rest of her life from the vaccine court, Alex.
[02:28:16.575 --> 02:28:23.081]  And the mother said, I'm very angry because people want to put people like me who are concerned about vaccine safety now.
[02:28:23.081 --> 02:28:26.745]  She's got a daughter that got $2,000,000 and a quarter million dollar for life.
[02:28:26.745 --> 02:28:28.506]  She's concerned about vaccine safety.
[02:28:28.506 --> 02:28:30.689]  She says they want to put people like me in jail.
[02:28:31.878 --> 02:28:33.679]  Let's expand on that, let's expand on that.
[02:28:33.679 --> 02:28:36.761]  Since they set the court up in the 70s, it's been kept secret.
[02:28:36.761 --> 02:28:49.630]  She's not even supposed to speak out when they put her daughter, because the daughter's admitted the truth, you know, they have a... Normally when they shoot your kid up and they have the convulsion, never talk again, and they get paralyzed, and they get put on a breathing machine, they arrest you and claim you beat them up.
[02:28:49.630 --> 02:29:01.118]  But now the science is there, they know it's the vaccine, and so she's supposed to sit down, take her 2 mil, and then sit there with her vegetable daughter, and absolutely, now, look, here's the article right here.
[02:29:02.138 --> 02:29:06.663]  Out of Fox News, gun owners will not be allowed to adopt children.
[02:29:06.663 --> 02:29:12.970]  Heartbroken couple denied being able to adopt a child because they have a gun permit.
[02:29:12.970 --> 02:29:18.796]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, they are preparing to persecute and say, if you've got guns, you can't fly.
[02:29:19.597 --> 02:29:22.398]  Or if you don't take vaccines, you can't have a job.
[02:29:22.398 --> 02:29:23.458]  This is the tyranny.
[02:29:23.458 --> 02:29:27.899]  You're supposed to let them brain damage your kids and carry out their black ops.
[02:29:27.899 --> 02:29:30.140]  And they're shooting our troops up with soft kill.
[02:29:30.140 --> 02:29:32.321]  But the good news is, is the bad news.
[02:29:32.321 --> 02:29:33.361]  They've hurt so many people.
[02:29:33.361 --> 02:29:36.382]  There's so many victims that everybody knows the enemy.
[02:29:36.382 --> 02:29:38.543]  And folks, the enemy is scared.
[02:29:38.543 --> 02:29:42.904]  And as Coca-Cola and McDonald's falls, so does the whole New World Order.
[02:29:42.904 --> 02:29:45.345]  And I'll explain that and take calls on the other side.
[02:29:45.345 --> 02:29:45.925]  Stay with us.
[02:29:45.925 --> 02:29:46.685]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:48.348 --> 02:29:51.354]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.354 --> 02:29:54.981]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.019 --> 02:30:06.225]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[02:31:18.600 --> 02:31:21.521]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.

[02:31:44.284 --> 02:31:49.629]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.

[02:31:59.221 --> 02:32:00.142]  Alex Jones here.
[02:32:00.142 --> 02:32:09.392]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[02:32:09.392 --> 02:32:14.638]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and even GMOs.
[02:32:14.938 --> 02:32:18.659]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[02:33:01.832 --> 02:33:08.453]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:33:08.453 --> 02:33:11.434]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:13.956 --> 02:33:15.157]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:15.157 --> 02:33:16.358]  I'm David Knight in studio.
[02:33:16.358 --> 02:33:19.962]  We're going to take your calls, but first, let's go back to Alex.
[02:33:19.962 --> 02:33:20.322]  That's right.
[02:33:20.322 --> 02:33:22.344]  We're going right to your calls after this plug.
[02:33:22.344 --> 02:33:26.048]  We're going to be going to Gerald Solutions.
[02:33:26.048 --> 02:33:28.030]  We're going to be talking to Rob.
[02:33:28.030 --> 02:33:32.955]  We're going to be talking to Robert, Shelly, and Aaron, and that'll be it for calls.
[02:33:32.955 --> 02:33:36.638]  David's going to come back after the special report with Rex Jones on drones.
[02:33:38.123 --> 02:33:42.166]  And he will put a bookend on the transmission today.
[02:33:42.166 --> 02:33:45.789]  There's a lot of other news we didn't get to that's on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:33:45.789 --> 02:33:49.751]  But I want to put on screen for TV viewers, it came out in U.S.
[02:33:49.751 --> 02:33:59.619]  papers and in British papers just last week, we covered it, where fluoride in new studies linked to obesity, depression, and failing thyroid.
[02:33:59.619 --> 02:34:00.319]  There's the headline.
[02:34:00.319 --> 02:34:03.902]  Fluoride in drinking water, triggering depression, weight gain, warned scientists.
[02:34:04.522 --> 02:34:11.564]  I mean, there are literally, when I say literally, I mean literally thousands of obnoxious studies since 1900 or so.
[02:34:11.564 --> 02:34:13.465]  A UT study from the 30s found all this.
[02:34:13.465 --> 02:34:16.526]  I mean, it's ridiculous what hydrofluorosilic acid does.
[02:34:16.526 --> 02:34:18.346]  Turbocharged fluoride.
[02:34:18.346 --> 02:34:21.687]  It's been souped up and had electrons added to it basically.
[02:34:21.687 --> 02:34:23.588]  It just fries you.
[02:34:23.588 --> 02:34:25.688]  And it adjuvants all the other toxins.
[02:34:25.688 --> 02:34:28.569]  I mean, it just mega kills your thyroid.
[02:34:28.569 --> 02:34:29.689]  Makes you fatter than a pig.
[02:34:29.689 --> 02:34:30.490]  You have no energy.
[02:34:31.770 --> 02:34:34.191]  The X2 niacin iodine is the good halogen.
[02:34:34.191 --> 02:34:36.211]  It did exactly what Dr. Grieb said it would do for me.
[02:34:36.211 --> 02:34:36.871]  It's incredible.
[02:34:36.871 --> 02:34:38.692]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:34:38.692 --> 02:34:39.912]  And that special's been taken down.
[02:34:39.912 --> 02:34:42.653]  I'm adding it back until it sells out.
[02:34:42.653 --> 02:34:45.654]  Two bottles of X2 get a free bottle of Ancient Defense.
[02:34:45.654 --> 02:34:50.075]  DNA 4 is normally 150-something bucks because it's such an expensive proprietary formula.
[02:34:50.075 --> 02:34:51.115]  Similar stuff, $300 to $600.
[02:34:51.115 --> 02:34:53.436]  It's $94 today.
[02:34:53.436 --> 02:34:57.577]  It's our highest quality, most expensive product for those that want to experience
[02:34:58.317 --> 02:34:59.659]  Well, just experience for yourself.
[02:34:59.659 --> 02:35:01.262]  Bare minimum, you're funding the broadcast.
[02:35:01.262 --> 02:35:03.024]  But at this price, you're not really funding it.
[02:35:03.024 --> 02:35:07.731]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:35:07.731 --> 02:35:13.540]  But my point in ranting about the water filtration is, we sell the highest quality gravity-fed filters that cut out the fluoride.
[02:35:15.642 --> 02:35:17.083]  The glyphosate, all of it.
[02:35:17.083 --> 02:35:19.404]  It's insane if you're not filtering your water.
[02:35:19.404 --> 02:35:20.884]  It's the number one thing you can do.
[02:35:20.884 --> 02:35:28.668]  You can fund the broadcast, get your G2 Pro1 systems, clearly filtered in others, at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:35:28.668 --> 02:35:33.631]  That's InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:35:33.631 --> 02:35:38.674]  Now let's race through your calls, or if not, David can get to them after the break.
[02:35:38.674 --> 02:35:41.495]  Let's talk to Gerald in Arkansas.
[02:35:41.495 --> 02:35:42.536]  Gerald, you're on the air.
[02:35:42.536 --> 02:35:43.136]  Thanks for holding.
[02:35:44.656 --> 02:35:46.797]  Yeah, Alex, you guys are doing a great job.
[02:35:46.797 --> 02:35:50.079]  You're the only one out there I know, because I've been around a while.
[02:35:50.079 --> 02:35:51.460]  I'm a former Marine.
[02:35:51.460 --> 02:35:53.481]  I served under John F. Kennedy.
[02:35:53.481 --> 02:35:56.904]  I've done my homework, too, at the Military-Industrial Complex.
[02:35:56.904 --> 02:36:02.427]  All these different things you're saying, you're the only one I know that is daily putting this out.
[02:36:02.427 --> 02:36:06.449]  And those that will listen, they're heeding the call.
[02:36:06.449 --> 02:36:11.993]  But we just have to keep putting it out there like you're doing, not opinion, but fact.
[02:36:12.518 --> 02:36:13.079]  Yes, sir.
[02:36:13.079 --> 02:36:13.519]  Yes, sir.
[02:36:42.655 --> 02:36:49.441]  Let me add something.
[02:36:49.441 --> 02:37:03.715]  I was recently in a court case that I was victorious in, private matter, but I was victorious in it, and my lawyers with common law trumped all the BS and brought in Magna Carta era information and the judge accepted it.
[02:37:03.715 --> 02:37:04.615]  You're absolutely right.
[02:37:04.615 --> 02:37:07.078]  Common law trumps everything.
[02:37:08.829 --> 02:37:12.191]  Hey man, now listen, please, and I will get off, but here's the thing.
[02:37:12.191 --> 02:37:16.072]  I send the IRS, and I'm being open here.
[02:37:16.072 --> 02:37:23.255]  They challenged me years ago, I was a taxpayer and all this crap, because I was ignorant.
[02:37:23.255 --> 02:37:25.156]  But I was open-minded.
[02:37:25.156 --> 02:37:29.638]  And so, Joe Bannister is the one that, one of the ones that taught me.
[02:37:29.638 --> 02:37:31.379]  God used him like he was an infant.
[02:37:31.379 --> 02:37:34.280]  Former Treasury Agent?
[02:37:34.280 --> 02:37:34.380]  Huh?
[02:37:34.380 --> 02:37:35.701]  Former Treasury Agent, really good guy, yeah.
[02:37:36.553 --> 02:37:37.173]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:37:37.173 --> 02:37:38.114]  And see, here's the thing.
[02:37:38.114 --> 02:37:41.535]  God uses you, uses the... It's the truth!
[02:37:41.535 --> 02:37:42.236]  It's the truth.
[02:37:42.236 --> 02:37:43.616]  There is no substitute.
[02:37:43.616 --> 02:37:53.641]  Anyway, I send them a bill of debt under the Constitution, a bill of attainment clause of the Constitution for the United States.
[02:37:53.641 --> 02:37:56.202]  This is all constitutional.
[02:37:56.202 --> 02:37:57.802]  So, David Knight is right.
[02:37:57.802 --> 02:37:58.743]  You're right.
[02:37:58.743 --> 02:38:01.724]  And this is how... You just documented it.
[02:38:01.724 --> 02:38:03.805]  This is how we counted these people.
[02:38:03.805 --> 02:38:05.446]  They can't answer this, Alex.
[02:38:05.446 --> 02:38:05.946]  You know what?
[02:38:06.900 --> 02:38:19.114]  The IRS, I've gotten letters from all these different agencies, and when I keep sending back, these court cases of Joe Bannister and Dale Long in 93, will fulfill you to file is Hogwarts.
[02:38:19.114 --> 02:38:22.518]  And once a jury hears all this, they throw it out!
[02:38:23.171 --> 02:38:25.453]  That's why the IRS are now losing a lot of its cases.
[02:38:25.453 --> 02:38:27.435]  Absolutely, the enemy is very afraid right now.
[02:38:27.435 --> 02:38:29.116]  I appreciate your call.
[02:38:29.116 --> 02:38:31.819]  The IRS folks collects for the private fellows, sir.
[02:38:31.819 --> 02:38:33.741]  We didn't have it until 1913.
[02:38:33.741 --> 02:38:34.601]  Great, great points.
[02:38:34.601 --> 02:38:35.882]  I've got to move quick here.
[02:38:35.882 --> 02:38:38.745]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rob in Missouri.
[02:38:38.745 --> 02:38:39.386]  You're on the air.
[02:38:39.386 --> 02:38:41.788]  What's your solution to defeat this attempted gun grab?
[02:38:43.188 --> 02:38:45.049]  Well, hi Alex and David.
[02:38:45.049 --> 02:38:51.533]  I think that the key to taking our Republic back is to educate the people what their rights and their protections are under the existing law.
[02:38:51.533 --> 02:38:52.613]  We don't need new laws.
[02:38:52.613 --> 02:38:53.834]  We've got plenty of laws.
[02:38:53.834 --> 02:38:56.636]  It's just that people don't know what the laws are.
[02:38:56.636 --> 02:39:01.098]  People may give up their guns during a gun confiscation because they don't know that the U.S.
[02:39:01.098 --> 02:39:08.282]  Code, Title 42, Section 5207 states that the confiscation of firearms is prohibited.
[02:39:08.282 --> 02:39:10.043]  The President can make all the U.N.
[02:39:10.043 --> 02:39:12.465]  and the foreign treaties that he likes, but
[02:39:13.530 --> 02:39:18.436]  Really, they have no teeth because... Let's expand on that.
[02:39:18.436 --> 02:39:21.240]  Let's briefly expand on that and then make your court point about the Supreme Court.
[02:39:22.028 --> 02:39:24.150]  He's saying the borders are wide open without a law.
[02:39:24.150 --> 02:39:26.352]  He's saying shut down power plants without a law.
[02:39:26.352 --> 02:39:29.435]  He's saying the FCC takes over the internet without a law.
[02:39:29.435 --> 02:39:30.256]  Exactly!
[02:39:30.256 --> 02:39:36.543]  And even the laws can be trumped by the Constitution when they violate the people's basic rights in the Bill of Rights.
[02:39:36.543 --> 02:39:41.568]  Or, under Article 9, what was already there as a free human.
[02:39:41.568 --> 02:39:43.850]  Absolutely, it's all total fraud.
[02:39:43.850 --> 02:39:45.712]  A final comment on that, then I want to get David Knight's take.
[02:39:49.587 --> 02:39:51.008]  354 U.S.
[02:39:51.008 --> 02:40:00.390]  1, 1956 states that there is no law, no foreign treaty that can trump or usurp the U.S.
[02:40:00.390 --> 02:40:02.210]  Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[02:40:02.210 --> 02:40:05.991]  And also, the President, one of his few powers is to make treaties.
[02:40:05.991 --> 02:40:09.832]  I mean, that's one of the few things that Article 2 of the Constitution grants him.
[02:40:09.832 --> 02:40:16.794]  His powers are to command the military, to seek and to give opinions to the Congress, and then to grant pardons.
[02:40:17.470 --> 02:40:21.913]  Absolutely.
[02:40:21.913 --> 02:40:24.874]  Listen, we're out of time right now.
[02:40:24.874 --> 02:40:25.594]  I've got to jump.
[02:40:25.594 --> 02:40:26.615]  Thanks for calling.
[02:40:26.615 --> 02:40:32.998]  We're going to come back after this special report after the break and David will finish up with your calls and go into overdrive if he so wishes.
[02:40:32.998 --> 02:40:37.781]  Again, David, we've got about one minute before we go to this report that my son put together.
[02:40:37.781 --> 02:40:39.142]  Put a book in on what you just heard.
[02:40:40.154 --> 02:40:45.257]  I would quote G. Edward Griffin where he said we have to stand collectively for individual rights.
[02:40:45.257 --> 02:40:46.578]  And that's what we're going to have to do.
[02:40:46.578 --> 02:40:49.280]  We're going to have to do that at the local level.
[02:40:49.280 --> 02:40:52.181]  We need to do things like stand up at these Agenda 21 meetings.
[02:40:52.181 --> 02:40:54.323]  They've got a United Nations agenda.
[02:40:54.323 --> 02:40:57.625]  They tell people that this is something that we're doing locally in your community.
[02:40:57.625 --> 02:40:58.766]  We want your input.
[02:40:58.766 --> 02:40:59.606]  They don't want your input.
[02:40:59.606 --> 02:41:00.867]  The whole thing is a deception.
[02:41:01.187 --> 02:41:08.069]  And so, as you pointed out earlier, Alex, just like a chicken that starts jumping up and down when a weasel gets in there, that's what we need to do.
[02:41:08.069 --> 02:41:12.391]  We need to wake up each other, but we need to stand collectively at the local level.
[02:41:12.391 --> 02:41:14.112]  It's not sexy to do it at the local level.
[02:41:14.112 --> 02:41:16.212]  It's very sexy to do it at the national level.
[02:41:16.212 --> 02:41:19.834]  But this whole thing with the Republicans now is just a distraction.
[02:41:19.834 --> 02:41:21.614]  Boehner is nothing but a distraction.
[02:41:21.614 --> 02:41:22.735]  He's totally irrelevant.
[02:41:22.735 --> 02:41:23.975]  He's not going to do anything.
[02:41:23.975 --> 02:41:26.176]  All these trials that they're doing are just show trials.
[02:41:27.298 --> 02:41:28.098]  That's right.
[02:41:28.098 --> 02:41:29.358]  Thank you so much, David Knight.
[02:41:29.358 --> 02:41:32.999]  You'll be back to complete the transmission after the break coming up.
[02:41:32.999 --> 02:41:40.121]  David Knight will also be hosting with Leanne McAdoo, Jakari Jackson, Rob Dube, Darren McBreen, and so many other great reporters.
[02:41:40.121 --> 02:41:44.002]  InfoWars Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central Standard Time.
[02:41:44.002 --> 02:41:47.343]  Weeknights, and of course that is on some cable and TV systems now.
[02:41:47.343 --> 02:41:51.364]  We're working on getting a big list of that together on the satellite systems here very, very soon.
[02:41:51.364 --> 02:41:52.444]  That's next on our agenda.
[02:41:53.084 --> 02:42:00.308]  Also, the redesign of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, so we're working very hard, and thanks to all your support, we're able to do it.
[02:42:00.308 --> 02:42:03.490]  Please consider becoming a member of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:42:03.490 --> 02:42:06.091]  It's only 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month.
[02:42:06.091 --> 02:42:07.712]  Sign up for a year, you get three months free.
[02:42:07.712 --> 02:42:09.033]  It's even less.
[02:42:09.033 --> 02:42:10.734]  20 people can use each membership.
[02:42:10.734 --> 02:42:14.556]  It takes about one minute to sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:42:14.556 --> 02:42:19.939]  You can do a monthly or yearly membership, and then 20 people can use your username simultaneously.
[02:42:20.419 --> 02:42:24.441]  If you ever try to log in and you can't, praise God, 20 people used it.
[02:42:24.441 --> 02:42:28.263]  So it's really like 100 memberships because most folks aren't going to use it all the time.
[02:42:28.263 --> 02:42:33.846]  Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central, archives of all the films and so much more at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:42:33.846 --> 02:42:39.168]  Now, here is the debut of my son, not wearing a mask like he did in some of the earlier reports.
[02:42:39.168 --> 02:42:40.989]  This is Rex Jones, 12 years old.
[02:42:40.989 --> 02:42:44.151]  He pretty much put this report together himself with Buckley Hammond.
[02:42:44.151 --> 02:42:48.173]  And so here it is on the good, the bad, the ugly of the robot rise of the drone.
[02:42:57.333 --> 02:43:02.878]  Hi, I'm Rex Jones, and this is a report about drones.
[02:43:02.878 --> 02:43:05.140]  What are drones?
[02:43:05.140 --> 02:43:07.963]  What are their uses in today's society?
[02:43:07.963 --> 02:43:14.549]  Will they make humanity obsolete compared to the new age of robotics and computer chips of tomorrow?
[02:43:19.398 --> 02:43:22.421]  What exactly is a civilian drone?
[02:43:22.421 --> 02:43:30.028]  A civilian drone is a drone that won't attack you, spy on you, or tase you in any way, shape, or form.
[02:43:30.028 --> 02:43:36.874]  These civilian drones normally go for a non-threatening look and style and approach, like this little thing over here.
[02:43:36.874 --> 02:43:42.018]  They're used in filming, photography, and just old plain recreational fun.
[02:43:42.779 --> 02:43:46.643]  In the media, drones are becoming more and more popular.
[02:43:46.643 --> 02:43:54.590]  Using drones in films is actually one of the number one new filmmakers trends that is going on in the USA today.
[02:43:54.590 --> 02:44:03.398]  Later, we're gonna have an expert veteran drone operator come on the show and have him explain to us all the little quirks and kinks that these drones have to offer.
[02:44:04.471 --> 02:44:11.034]  Before we go to our expert, I would just like to explain to you a few facts about drones.
[02:44:11.034 --> 02:44:19.899]  A drone, as Wikipedia and Webster describe it, is an unmanned aircraft or ship guided by a remote control or onboard computer.
[02:44:23.004 --> 02:44:27.029]  When operating a drone, the owner must have a direct line of sight.
[02:44:27.029 --> 02:44:35.177]  The direct line of sight allows the owner of the drone to fly it safely and to make sure he does not get disoriented.
[02:44:35.177 --> 02:44:37.840]  Now let's take a look at the job market.
[02:44:37.840 --> 02:44:42.606]  With more and more drones being spat out of factories, the jobs are opening up.
[02:44:43.892 --> 02:44:49.715]  Amazon is looking for drone pilots to drop gifts off at people's houses.
[02:44:49.715 --> 02:44:55.657]  And all sorts of other companies are lining up and making sure they hire for new drone operators.
[02:44:55.657 --> 02:44:58.679]  So hey, if you're a hobbyist, you just got a job.
[02:44:58.679 --> 02:45:02.940]  Now that we've covered the basics of drones, let's go to a real expert.
[02:45:02.940 --> 02:45:07.462]  I would like to introduce you to Gerard of I Am Ariel.
[02:45:07.462 --> 02:45:08.463]  How does a drone work?
[02:45:08.943 --> 02:45:12.587]  Surprisingly, the technology of drones is a lot like cell phones.
[02:45:12.587 --> 02:45:14.568]  Basically, cell phones have a GPS.
[02:45:14.568 --> 02:45:18.432]  They have what they call an IMU, which tells you its orientation.
[02:45:18.432 --> 02:45:19.713]  They have a compass.
[02:45:19.713 --> 02:45:22.876]  So basically, these are the same kind of things that you find in a drone.
[02:45:22.876 --> 02:45:27.420]  A GPS, internally, you'll have a compass, exactly.
[02:45:27.420 --> 02:45:30.203]  Here, you'll have a place where you can attach your camera.
[02:45:30.203 --> 02:45:33.426]  So, really, the technology is very similar to a cell phone.
[02:45:33.706 --> 02:45:36.067]  When I'm looking at this, this is a battery, right?
[02:45:36.067 --> 02:45:36.807]  Yep.
[02:45:36.807 --> 02:45:44.189]  So, what makes this so different than the average Duracell D or AA battery you'd buy at Target?
[02:45:44.189 --> 02:45:50.270]  First of all, it's a lithium polymer battery and it's very light and it's very high voltage.
[02:45:50.270 --> 02:45:57.672]  So, it gives these guys a lot of thrust and gets them up in the air and flying for a good amount of time.
[02:45:57.672 --> 02:45:58.272]  Amazon?
[02:45:59.321 --> 02:46:07.206]  is looking at hiring ex-military personnel to fly drones and deliver packages to their customers.
[02:46:07.206 --> 02:46:09.708]  How do you feel about that and what are some problems there?
[02:46:09.708 --> 02:46:11.989]  Well, I think it's a really neat concept.
[02:46:11.989 --> 02:46:25.238]  I think a lot of things need to be figured out as far as, you know, allowing these drones to travel through cities and buildings and just being very careful and mindful of where these things go, especially when you lose
[02:46:25.618 --> 02:46:27.199]  What happens when a drone gets out of control?
[02:46:46.275 --> 02:47:00.661]  Yeah, and you know, that's a very unfortunate case, and it doesn't happen all the time, but sometimes if the battery runs out, or there's some pilot error, the drone will fly away.
[02:47:00.661 --> 02:47:05.283]  And fortunately, with a lot of these systems, it's built in what they call return to home.
[02:47:05.283 --> 02:47:15.568]  So, for example, with this remote, if I just power it off, the drone knows to automatically come back to the point where I launched it from, because it's locked in by the GPS.
[02:47:15.908 --> 02:47:24.996]  The government has started to put kill switches into these drones to where it's in the firmware to restrict drone usage in certain areas.
[02:47:24.996 --> 02:47:35.445]  If I was flying this drone near the White House or any other top secret government area, it would immediately fall out of the sky or just return to home.
[02:47:35.845 --> 02:47:38.047]  The most important thing, I think it's a safety issue.
[02:47:38.047 --> 02:47:50.298]  And for example, if you try to fly these drones within five miles of an airport, you can literally be flying and it's almost like it hits a brick wall and it will just not go into that airspace.
[02:47:50.298 --> 02:47:53.080]  And it's designed for a reason, right?
[02:47:53.080 --> 02:47:56.844]  We don't want drones in the airspace of planes and all that kind of stuff.
[02:47:57.304 --> 02:48:07.027]  But the problem with that is that when we come out with, like, you know how Google's always talking about smart cars and smart planes that will self-drive?
[02:48:07.027 --> 02:48:11.648]  The problem is, what would happen if the firmware was in those as well?
[02:48:11.648 --> 02:48:16.190]  One day, if it was in a computer chip, that could be implanted into humans.
[02:48:16.190 --> 02:48:19.071]  So, there's concerns there about the government regulating.
[02:48:19.071 --> 02:48:20.371]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:48:20.371 --> 02:48:22.372]  Gerard, it was great to have you here.
[02:48:22.372 --> 02:48:22.912]  Thank you, Rex.
[02:48:22.912 --> 02:48:23.372]  Appreciate it.
[02:48:24.005 --> 02:48:33.529]  In this chilling commercial put out by the Pennsylvania Tax Committee, they brag about how they might use drones to track us and spy on us.
[02:48:33.529 --> 02:48:37.831]  They claim that they would only use it on tax cheats, but what if you were a government dissident?
[02:48:37.831 --> 02:48:38.991]  It's easy.
[02:48:38.991 --> 02:48:45.434]  Pay online by June 18th, and we'll skip your penalty and take half off your interest.
[02:48:45.434 --> 02:48:48.775]  Because, Tom, we do know who you are.
[02:48:51.468 --> 02:48:56.554]  Now that we're done with consumer drones, it's time to move on to military and law enforcement drones.
[02:48:56.554 --> 02:49:08.127]  These drones go from tiny nano-spy drones that they're using in Iraq to track criminals to the giant Reaper drones which can fire four Hellfire missiles raining down on villages.
[02:49:09.028 --> 02:49:14.431]  Let's go through a few InfoWars.com articles about the drone threat today.
[02:49:14.431 --> 02:49:14.772]  U.S.
[02:49:14.772 --> 02:49:19.775]  drone kills four al-Qaeda suspects, not confirmed, in Yemen.
[02:49:19.775 --> 02:49:20.995]  Says here, a U.S.
[02:49:20.995 --> 02:49:28.260]  drone killed four suspected al-Qaeda militants in northeast Yemen on Monday morning, officials and tribesmen said.
[02:49:29.491 --> 02:49:33.275]  I wonder how many other people got hurt by the shrapnel and the blast.
[02:49:33.275 --> 02:49:34.436]  Because this was in a village.
[02:49:34.436 --> 02:49:36.998]  This was not out in the middle of nowhere.
[02:49:36.998 --> 02:49:40.121]  Now let's look at the law enforcement side of things.
[02:49:40.121 --> 02:49:44.906]  Riot control drone to shoot pepper spray bullets at protesters.
[02:49:44.906 --> 02:49:45.446]  How nice.
[02:49:46.147 --> 02:49:51.114]  For decades now, riot control has always been a government must-have.
[02:49:51.114 --> 02:49:54.939]  There are a lot of these riot control drones, and I want to go to another one.
[02:49:54.939 --> 02:49:59.885]  A DHS-funded Taser drone that was launched right here in Texas.
[02:50:01.013 --> 02:50:20.746]  Montgomery County in Texas spent $250,000 on a taser drone that can follow a suspect and shoot four barbed electrodes that can be shot at a distance of 100 feet, delivering neuromuscular incapacitation to the victim.
[02:50:20.746 --> 02:50:23.668]  I think that this is a very proactive way to steal our rights.
[02:50:23.988 --> 02:50:27.212]  Well, we've learned a lot about drones today, but that's not all.
[02:50:27.212 --> 02:50:30.156]  Go online and be active and find more knowledge.
[02:50:30.156 --> 02:50:33.279]  Infowars.com isn't a bad place to start either.
[02:50:33.279 --> 02:50:38.285]  So, have fun!
[02:50:38.285 --> 02:50:41.549]  I'm Rex Jones, reporting for Infowars.com.
[02:50:59.670 --> 02:51:00.490]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:51:00.490 --> 02:51:02.271]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:51:02.271 --> 02:51:03.932]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:51:03.932 --> 02:51:06.754]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:51:06.754 --> 02:51:09.035]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:51:09.035 --> 02:51:13.558]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[02:51:13.558 --> 02:51:17.500]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[02:51:17.500 --> 02:51:21.262]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[02:51:21.262 --> 02:51:21.702]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[02:51:21.702 --> 02:51:23.323]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.

[02:51:54.271 --> 02:51:56.571]  The Future of Talk Radio.
[02:51:56.571 --> 02:51:58.371]  GCN.
[02:51:58.371 --> 02:51:58.912]  Hi, folks.
[02:51:58.912 --> 02:52:01.192]  Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:52:01.192 --> 02:52:06.313]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at My Patriot Supply.
[02:52:06.313 --> 02:52:14.135]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:52:14.435 --> 02:52:18.960]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:52:18.960 --> 02:52:22.945]  By Patriots Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:52:22.945 --> 02:52:28.892]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:52:28.892 --> 02:52:29.292]  It is rare
[02:52:29.312 --> 02:52:29.532]  We're good.
[02:52:58.565 --> 02:52:59.586]  Hey, Boomer!
[02:52:59.586 --> 02:53:03.028]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[02:53:03.028 --> 02:53:04.689]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[02:53:04.689 --> 02:53:06.650]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[02:53:06.650 --> 02:53:12.494]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[02:53:12.494 --> 02:53:13.314]  I know, right?
[02:53:13.314 --> 02:53:14.635]  You love it too!
[02:53:14.635 --> 02:53:16.076]  Yeah, I'm thirsty too.
[02:53:16.076 --> 02:53:17.097]  Let's go get some!
[02:53:17.097 --> 02:53:18.818]  Get Berkey Clean Water by calling 877-886-3653.
[02:53:18.818 --> 02:53:19.198]  That's 877-886-3653.
[02:53:19.198 --> 02:53:19.898]  Or visit GoBerkey.com.
[02:53:27.763 --> 02:53:28.924]  It's happening again.
[02:53:28.924 --> 02:53:32.546]  The Feds are trying to ban your freedom to own body armor.
[02:53:32.546 --> 02:53:35.968]  In January, a newly introduced bill, H.R.
[02:53:35.968 --> 02:53:40.010]  378, will take away your right to buy level 3 and higher body armor.
[02:53:40.010 --> 02:53:45.514]  Katie Armor offers the most affordable level 3 body armor packages on the market today.
[02:53:45.514 --> 02:53:46.634]  Protect yourself.
[02:53:46.634 --> 02:53:49.716]  Buy your body armor now before it's too late.
[02:53:49.716 --> 02:53:51.437]  Go to katiarmor.com.
[02:53:51.437 --> 02:53:54.419]  That's k-a-t-i-armor.com.
[02:53:54.419 --> 02:53:55.480]  Come and take it.
[02:54:04.306 --> 02:54:05.667]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:05.667 --> 02:54:06.688]  I'm David Knight in studio.
[02:54:06.688 --> 02:54:08.550]  We've had Alex joining us on the road.
[02:54:08.550 --> 02:54:10.351]  We're going to go to your calls in just a moment.
[02:54:10.351 --> 02:54:15.496]  We just heard that special report from Alex's son, Rex Jones.
[02:54:15.496 --> 02:54:20.660]  Parents, that's a great way to get your kids going on things that are going to matter for their life.
[02:54:20.660 --> 02:54:22.061]  Let them pursue their interests.
[02:54:22.061 --> 02:54:28.207]  We tend to overprotect our children, especially today, and say, well, you've got to wait until you're a certain age to do this or do that.
[02:54:28.727 --> 02:54:31.370]  I'm not a big fan of that kind of approach to parenting.
[02:54:31.370 --> 02:54:35.855]  A lot of homeschoolers know that kids can do a lot more than we give them credit for.
[02:54:35.855 --> 02:54:38.799]  Great, great report from Rex about drones.
[02:54:38.799 --> 02:54:43.804]  And of course, that's a burgeoning industry that the FAA is moving to shut down.
[02:54:44.685 --> 02:54:58.532]  Finding people for flying a five-pound styrofoam plane, fining them $10,000, mandating that you have to have commercially trained pilots to fly these drones, as well as watchers.
[02:54:58.532 --> 02:55:05.735]  They're going to load that up with regulations to try to take that over, just like the FCC is trying to take over the internet, just like the FTC is trying to take over the internet.
[02:55:05.735 --> 02:55:08.576]  You've got the FAA, the FCC, the FTC.
[02:55:08.576 --> 02:55:13.399]  If we don't get these guys under control, we are truly going to be effed completely.
[02:55:14.161 --> 02:55:14.982]  That's what we've got.
[02:55:14.982 --> 02:55:18.864]  We've got to stop down these burgeoning bureaucracies.
[02:55:18.864 --> 02:55:20.205]  But let's go to your calls right now.
[02:55:20.205 --> 02:55:20.846]  We've got Shelly.
[02:55:20.846 --> 02:55:23.587]  We're also going to try to go to Chad, Todd, Aaron, Dan.
[02:55:23.587 --> 02:55:25.229]  We'll go into overdrive to try to get everybody.
[02:55:25.229 --> 02:55:26.349]  Appreciate you holding.
[02:55:26.349 --> 02:55:28.171]  Let's go to Shelly in Tennessee.
[02:55:28.171 --> 02:55:29.551]  Shelly?
[02:55:29.551 --> 02:55:30.752]  Hey.
[02:55:30.752 --> 02:55:37.797]  You know, I just happened to catch the Knoxville News Sentinel, the local newspaper here, and
[02:55:39.744 --> 02:55:49.366]  There was an attempted entry into the Y-12 National Complex by a Arabic guy.
[02:55:49.366 --> 02:55:52.107]  His last name was Malachar.
[02:55:52.107 --> 02:55:56.007]  What kind of a complex is that?
[02:55:56.007 --> 02:56:02.729]  It's the Y-12 National Security Complex, and they store stuff there.
[02:56:02.729 --> 02:56:03.569]  Not really sure.
[02:56:03.569 --> 02:56:07.070]  I don't have a clearance, so I wouldn't know.
[02:56:08.851 --> 02:56:28.684]  Well it's interesting, there's a lot of these stories that pick up locally that don't go national, and we don't realize how close we are, not even to people breaking into a secure facility and doing something malicious, but just out of even, let's say, sheer incompetence, if that's what's going on in the story that we've been following in Tulane at the Primate Center, where they
[02:56:29.244 --> 02:56:33.026]  This very dangerous bacteria they brought into the country to weaponize.
[02:56:33.026 --> 02:56:41.729]  Somehow it got out of their biosafety lab, level 3 lab, into the outdoor cages, which are right next door to wetlands, a neighborhood, a school.
[02:56:41.729 --> 02:56:43.830]  I mean, you know, how did that happen?
[02:56:43.830 --> 02:56:44.550]  They still don't know.
[02:56:44.550 --> 02:56:50.412]  They sent back another crew to try to investigate how that breach occurred and if it's escaped beyond that area.
[02:56:50.412 --> 02:56:52.313]  What happened in Tennessee, though?
[02:56:52.313 --> 02:56:53.854]  What did the local news say about that?
[02:56:53.854 --> 02:56:54.294]  Did he get in?
[02:56:55.538 --> 02:57:14.666]  No, of course he didn't, but, you know, just the fact that he even attempted, and he just walks in to the Visitor Center, and he went through a back door, and it was like a Friday evening, about 6.30, I guess, and somebody caught up to him and, you know, probably said, hey, what are you doing?
[02:57:14.666 --> 02:57:23.230]  And he demanded a tour, and of course, they told him to go pound sand, so he left there, and they must have called the police.
[02:57:24.191 --> 02:57:35.120]  And he left there and he went right down the road, because we have like three complexes here that are ran by the Department of Energy, and so he went right down the road to the Oak Ridge National Lab.
[02:57:37.256 --> 02:57:43.761]  He drove up to the front gate, and of course, you know, it's secured also, you know, you have to have a badge to get in.
[02:57:43.761 --> 02:57:51.888]  And, you know, security denied him access there, and he demanded a tour to get into there, and that's when the cops picked him up.
[02:57:51.888 --> 02:58:01.036]  But he was, he had a California driver's license, which was suspended, and his vehicle was registered in Texas.
[02:58:02.335 --> 02:58:04.175]  Yeah, you can probably just walk across the border.
[02:58:04.175 --> 02:58:09.917]  We've got open borders, so if we've got open borders, it's going to be pretty hard to try to catch anybody that's coming in.
[02:58:09.917 --> 02:58:16.118]  But you know, the interesting thing about the open borders is they're not open if you're flying in or if you're trying to get out.
[02:58:16.118 --> 02:58:26.200]  And when we look at the way they scrutinize people traveling by air travel and the way they keep the other borders completely open, that should give us a clue that the real danger is to close those borders.
[02:58:26.200 --> 02:58:28.881]  We need to stop the incentives that are pulling people in.
[02:58:28.881 --> 02:58:30.381]  We'll be right back with more of your calls.
[02:58:30.381 --> 02:58:30.781]  Stay with us.
[02:58:41.676 --> 02:58:45.675]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:48.931 --> 02:58:57.937]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[02:58:57.937 --> 02:59:08.463]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[02:59:08.463 --> 02:59:14.547]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:59:14.887 --> 02:59:21.291]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:59:21.291 --> 02:59:29.897]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[02:59:29.897 --> 02:59:32.979]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:59:32.979 --> 02:59:34.500]  No needles, no injections.
[02:59:34.500 --> 02:59:35.901]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:59:35.901 --> 02:59:37.102]  Try it for yourself.
[02:59:37.102 --> 02:59:39.524]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.
[02:59:39.524 --> 02:59:41.845]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.
[02:59:41.845 --> 02:59:44.287]  Secure yours today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:44.747 --> 02:59:51.431]  Or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:59:51.431 --> 03:00:00.296]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:00.296 --> 03:00:05.699]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:05.699 --> 03:00:08.001]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:00:09.986 --> 03:00:11.307]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:11.307 --> 03:00:13.408]  I'm David Knight and we're in Overdrive.
[03:00:13.408 --> 03:00:17.591]  I wanted to give Aaron, Chad, Todd, Luke a chance to call.
[03:00:17.591 --> 03:00:19.092]  So we're going to go to those calls right away.
[03:00:19.092 --> 03:00:20.193]  Try to move through them very quickly.
[03:00:20.193 --> 03:00:21.634]  Let's go to Aaron in California.
[03:00:21.634 --> 03:00:24.396]  Aaron?
[03:00:24.396 --> 03:00:25.436]  Go ahead, Aaron.
[03:00:25.436 --> 03:00:25.937]  Hey.
[03:00:25.937 --> 03:00:26.577]  Hey, go ahead.
[03:00:26.577 --> 03:00:33.401]  I just want to say that... I just want to say that if Alex Jones is listening, he's my hero.
[03:00:33.401 --> 03:00:33.762]  I'm sorry?
[03:00:33.762 --> 03:00:38.205]  Yeah, let's... Okay, let's go to Chad in North Carolina.
[03:00:38.205 --> 03:00:38.285]  Chad?
[03:00:40.140 --> 03:00:41.641]  Hey, how's it going?
[03:00:41.641 --> 03:00:56.551]  Long-time fan, first-time caller, and I was wondering if there were any follow-ups to the FTC situation going on with their takeover of the internet, which is completely insane, and exactly what the objective of the FTC, the involvement there is.
[03:00:57.079 --> 03:01:02.404]  Well, you know, that's interesting, Chad, because we've had a lot of people, especially in the liberal press, who say, isn't this great?
[03:01:02.404 --> 03:01:04.185]  We now have net neutrality.
[03:01:04.185 --> 03:01:05.907]  Thank you so much, FCC.
[03:01:05.907 --> 03:01:09.610]  It's been a week, we haven't even seen the rules that they passed.
[03:01:09.610 --> 03:01:14.574]  And we've got a Congress that is so incredibly passive, they're not doing anything about it.
[03:01:14.574 --> 03:01:19.658]  That's one of the reasons why when I looked at this bill to shut down the ATF, my first response, I don't know what...
[03:01:20.539 --> 03:01:27.928]  What the Congress can do to try to get control of these bureaucracies that they created and abdicated their authority to, one of the things they can do is to cut their budget.
[03:01:27.928 --> 03:01:33.935]  We saw that as part of the fight to try to control Obama's edict for open borders.
[03:01:33.935 --> 03:01:37.999]  They said, let's control the budget for the Department of Homeland Security.
[03:01:37.999 --> 03:01:39.161]  But then, of course, they caved.
[03:01:39.161 --> 03:01:39.822]  They couldn't do that.
[03:01:40.660 --> 03:01:43.541]  That's about the only thing they can do at this point is to cut their budgets.
[03:01:43.541 --> 03:01:47.802]  But of course, the FCC is now going to assert that they have control over the Internet.
[03:01:47.802 --> 03:01:49.602]  That's the important thing to understand, Chad.
[03:01:49.602 --> 03:01:52.042]  We don't know what they're going to do with net neutrality.
[03:01:52.042 --> 03:01:55.183]  And of course, we've had a functioning Internet for decades.
[03:01:55.183 --> 03:01:56.603]  It's served us just fine.
[03:01:56.603 --> 03:02:01.164]  That's an issue that was a couple of years old that was negotiated between the competing companies.
[03:02:01.164 --> 03:02:02.385]  They worked that out.
[03:02:02.385 --> 03:02:03.765]  It's not a crisis.
[03:02:03.765 --> 03:02:04.805]  It's not a problem.
[03:02:04.805 --> 03:02:06.406]  The Internet is not broken.
[03:02:06.406 --> 03:02:08.286]  They merely want to assert control
[03:02:08.846 --> 03:02:12.930]  And they're still not telling us what they're going to do with these regulations a week after.
[03:02:12.930 --> 03:02:22.518]  That's the takeaway from this, is the arrogance of these regulatory agencies that won't even tell Congress, let alone the public, what they're going to do.
[03:02:22.518 --> 03:02:24.380]  And we're still waiting for an answer as to what they're doing.
[03:02:24.380 --> 03:02:25.141]  Does that answer your question?
[03:02:26.718 --> 03:02:38.967]  Yeah, yeah, and I was watching a documentary the day before yesterday about, via the Turning with the Enemies Act, how we are all considered enemies of the state, which is, again, insane.
[03:02:38.967 --> 03:02:46.073]  And I think that had something to do with the Federal Reserve taking away private ownership of gold and massive amounts of it.
[03:02:46.613 --> 03:02:47.193]  I mean, I don't know.
[03:02:47.193 --> 03:02:47.433]  I don't know.
[03:03:16.380 --> 03:03:20.703]  I've got a lot of info, so I'm just going to try to get it out quickly.
[03:03:20.703 --> 03:03:26.146]  First of all, I think the overall disinfo operations of the globalists, they see it in two different fronts.
[03:03:26.146 --> 03:03:35.211]  There's the public front, where the general public is vastly, you know, way too dumbed down to ever, you know, be any use to anyone.
[03:03:35.211 --> 03:03:45.537]  And then there's the law enforcement front, where they're trying to keep people in government totally compartmentalized so that they're pretty much ineffective.
[03:03:46.500 --> 03:04:06.990]  Um, and so the reason why I think the question has been asked, why are they exponentially going for broke on so many fronts, is because I think they have noticed that as far as law enforcement is concerned, people in government have started to wake up a lot quicker than they predicted.
[03:04:08.098 --> 03:04:09.679]  I agree.
[03:04:09.679 --> 03:04:12.020]  And that's why they've got to get control of the internet.
[03:04:12.020 --> 03:04:12.901]  Absolutely.
[03:04:12.901 --> 03:04:16.883]  I want to move real quickly to, thanks Todd, I want to move real quickly to Luke.
[03:04:16.883 --> 03:04:18.384]  Are you calling from Vietnam, Luke?
[03:04:19.406 --> 03:04:22.088]  Yes, I'm calling from Vietnam.
[03:04:22.088 --> 03:04:29.434]  I actually was listening to you yesterday talking about Barrett Lancaster Brown, who's charged by the FBI.
[03:04:29.434 --> 03:04:32.597]  There's something very similar to me I've talked about before.
[03:04:32.597 --> 03:04:37.181]  I won't talk about my own saga again of obtaining information on a law enforcement officer.
[03:04:37.181 --> 03:04:44.787]  But something our cases have in common is that the state has gone after our family members as well in both of our cases.
[03:04:44.787 --> 03:04:46.248]  Yes, like they did with Barrett Brown.
[03:04:46.869 --> 03:04:47.911]  I'm sorry.
[03:04:47.911 --> 03:04:50.136]  Call in and we'll put you at the head of the line.
[03:04:50.136 --> 03:04:52.140]  We've run out of time and overdrive.
[03:04:52.140 --> 03:04:55.026]  I'm sorry I didn't see that you were calling from Vietnam earlier.
[03:04:55.026 --> 03:04:56.629]  I would have gotten to you sooner.
[03:04:56.629 --> 03:04:58.413]  Call us back and we'll put you at the head of the line.
[03:04:58.413 --> 03:04:58.914]  Thanks so much.
