[00:00.000 --> 00:14.680]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.680 --> 00:31.800]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones this is going to be another
[00:31.800 --> 00:39.760]  completely jam-packed global transmission it's Tuesday the 30th day of June 2015 we're now way
[00:39.760 --> 00:46.240]  past half the year we are going to be having know me friends former managing director of
[00:46.240 --> 00:52.880]  Goldman Sachs on with us she left Goldman Sachs back in 2002 warning in several New
[00:52.880 --> 00:59.080]  York Times best-selling books about exactly what was coming in the future she's not somebody
[00:59.080 --> 01:04.920]  that's leaving now and criticizing the system so they don't get prosecuted she left 13 years
[01:04.920 --> 01:12.760]  ago and she worked directly under the head of the entire company even more powerful some estimate
[01:12.760 --> 01:20.280]  then JP Morgan Chase at the top of the pyramid there's no debate there are two horses that pull
[01:20.280 --> 01:26.040]  the New World Order at the very head of it it's Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and she was directly
[01:26.040 --> 01:32.600]  under kind of like the Darth Vader to Emperor Palpatine there's a lot of managing directors
[01:32.600 --> 01:38.920]  at Goldman Sachs not a lot but quite a few she was a managing director directly under
[01:39.640 --> 01:48.120]  serving directly under a top lieutenant to one of the dark lords and so that's all coming up
[01:48.120 --> 01:55.080]  today with the continued accelerated meltdown in Europe that ties into the entire planetary economy
[01:55.960 --> 02:01.240]  and again we keep talking about this for the last few months the huge build up for something big
[02:01.240 --> 02:05.240]  does that mean it's about to happen I don't like the bubble I wish we weren't in a bubble
[02:05.240 --> 02:10.440]  I'll be honest I want the bubble to keep expanding at a at a at a fleshly level because I don't want
[02:10.440 --> 02:15.880]  to see a depression slash global meltdown but it's true the bigger the bubble gets the worst
[02:15.880 --> 02:22.360]  it's going to be it's kind of like we're on a cliff that just keeps getting higher it's being
[02:22.360 --> 02:26.600]  thrust up out of the ground and I don't want to have to jump off but the longer we wait
[02:26.600 --> 02:32.680]  the further we've got to jump and we don't have a parachute and at a certain point the
[02:32.680 --> 02:40.200]  fall is going to be so great that it's going to be fatal so there's another allegory we have
[02:40.200 --> 02:45.080]  congressman Ron Paul joining us former congressman Thursday with huge news Jesse Ventura is also
[02:45.080 --> 02:52.520]  joining us Thursday have a lot of big guests coming up throughout the week when we come back
[02:52.520 --> 02:57.000]  I'm going to launch into all the news and it is extremely important obviously
[03:00.200 --> 03:03.000]  we will also be looking at maniac police today
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.200]  in the US and why are they recruiting people that behave like this some of the most amazing
[03:10.200 --> 03:17.320]  footage of maniac cop straps handcuff man to a chair and tortures him for resisting even when
[03:17.320 --> 03:24.680]  the other cops are telling him to stop and how this ties into the mindset of the controllers
[03:24.680 --> 03:29.720]  themselves top scientists are saying another mega earthquake and be getting ready to hit
[03:29.720 --> 03:34.520]  the San Andreas fault out on the west coast but I said I'd play this yesterday and I want to get
[03:34.520 --> 03:39.400]  to it today one of the top analysts and fund managers out there incredible record of accuracy
[03:39.400 --> 03:45.560]  Jim Rogers warning about the greece situation here it is how is that going to affect the economy
[03:45.560 --> 03:51.080]  there well of course it's going to affect it badly if you cannot get the money you cannot spend it
[03:51.080 --> 03:56.920]  and we don't not reverting to our border economy yet anyway but no of course the greece greek
[03:56.920 --> 04:01.560]  economy is going to collapse this week and probably for a while people are terrified and you would
[04:01.560 --> 04:07.800]  be too so would I what about the overall picture here greece blames the eu for the debt crisis but
[04:07.800 --> 04:13.400]  its finances and policies have been in a really bad state since joining the year really surely
[04:13.400 --> 04:19.000]  should take some responsibility you know the greek economy has been in a bad shape for about
[04:19.000 --> 04:24.920]  190 years as it goes back to when they became independent a long long long time ago no you're
[04:24.920 --> 04:30.520]  exactly right this economy has been having recurred crisis since they joined the eu this has been
[04:30.520 --> 04:35.320]  going on for several years now if you ask me what they should do is just go ahead and go bankrupt
[04:35.320 --> 04:39.720]  that's right get it over with and start over all right we're gonna break calling name here's the
[04:39.720 --> 04:45.560]  issue all of our countries are bankrupt by design we've been maneuvered into this and once you collapse
[04:45.560 --> 04:51.640]  like greece or mexico or argentina you hardly ever come back because the globalists never let you get
[04:51.640 --> 04:57.880]  out of it you should just let it all fold then rebuild but they don't do that they never ride off
[04:57.880 --> 05:05.640]  the debt a mother in westbrook main was arrested by police and charged with child endangerment
[05:05.640 --> 05:11.720]  after she let her seven-year-old daughter play unsupervised in a park only a few hundred feet
[05:11.720 --> 05:17.160]  from their home nicole jensen said that police asked her to accompany them to the station
[05:17.160 --> 05:23.240]  because her child was outside unsupervised and wouldn't you know it it was a nosy neighbor
[05:23.240 --> 05:28.680]  who called the cops after seeing the child alone in the park it has now become the norm
[05:28.680 --> 05:34.280]  for americans to panic and call the police if they see a child playing in a park even though
[05:34.280 --> 05:40.440]  jensen can see the park from her porch and requires that her kids check in with her every hour well it
[05:40.440 --> 05:45.800]  wasn't enough instead of walking the girl one minute to her home the cops took the child into
[05:45.800 --> 05:51.960]  custody the case has been deferred to the dhhs and jensen says she will go to court to fight
[05:51.960 --> 05:57.880]  against the charges of endangerment and you can learn more about this story right now at info wars

[11:18.440 --> 11:24.680]  they're going default i'm sure they deserve it because the media told us so just like Greece
[11:24.680 --> 11:28.760]  and just like you'll deserve to have part of your private bank account taken to save the economy
[11:28.760 --> 11:32.600]  in the next banker bailout and they'll have the media tell you it's all your fault even though
[11:32.600 --> 11:37.640]  you've paid your bills and paid 70 percent of what you make in one form of taxes of the other it
[11:37.640 --> 11:44.760]  doesn't matter us top court rules against obama administration over air pollution rule
[11:46.760 --> 11:52.520]  obama issues nineteen classified directives changing laws passed by congress
[11:54.600 --> 11:58.440]  not only now does the president act as a dictator in most cases
[11:58.440 --> 12:05.000]  but the dictatorial edicts are secret you can't get more Kafka or 1984 s
[12:05.000 --> 12:12.120]  award-winning comedian says politically correct left has killed comedy and you know i want the
[12:12.120 --> 12:17.000]  guys and the gals back there to grab the three clips here because i never played seinfeld a month
[12:17.000 --> 12:24.680]  ago jerry seinfeld amazing comic and a liberal by the way coming out and saying there's a fascist
[12:24.680 --> 12:30.040]  threat to freedom in america from political correctness well we got bill marr saying the same thing i
[12:30.040 --> 12:34.840]  mean that guy's a tyrant and a half i'm what you're criticizing about your victories
[12:40.680 --> 12:45.960]  that's what this is is language ending freedom ending garbage but there's three clips of top
[12:45.960 --> 12:51.960]  comedians in here talking about how horrible it is i thought we'd play some of those because
[12:51.960 --> 12:56.920]  there's some new clubs plus the one i mentioned rand paul raised money with marijuana industry
[12:56.920 --> 13:02.760]  in denver i love how the left all loves obama who promised to legalize marijuana and then
[13:02.760 --> 13:08.840]  doubled the raids on dispensaries and lawsuits and crackdowns conservatively that bush had against
[13:08.840 --> 13:20.280]  states legalizing medical marijuana it's not that paul's some doper it's that he realizes that you
[13:20.280 --> 13:25.160]  end up making it a black market empowering criminals when you have marijuana illegal
[13:25.160 --> 13:28.840]  you decriminalize it then you can tax it and control it and control the quality
[13:28.840 --> 13:33.960]  and yes that is his big crime he admits to the big secret in colleges he would take good looking
[13:33.960 --> 13:40.120]  girls down to the river in weiko and smoke pot with them oh my gosh that's why the left hates him
[13:41.640 --> 13:45.640]  because he won't throw him in prison and he wants to get rid of the phony drug laws
[13:47.000 --> 13:51.880]  you want a democratic party founded by the klan that wants your guns and wants to put you in
[13:51.880 --> 13:57.320]  presence doesn't matter if in democratic controlled states and cities blacks have the highest per capita
[13:57.880 --> 14:05.080]  incarceration rate it doesn't matter you love it because you want to imagine you're the liberal
[14:05.080 --> 14:09.000]  and imagine you're the winner oh i'm sorry i haven't gone through all the stacks yet i'm just
[14:09.000 --> 14:19.080]  i'm just giving you this top story in each stack could la's big one be even bigger than we thought
[14:19.080 --> 14:28.520]  now we have explosive new information helium is leaking from massive earthquake fault
[14:28.520 --> 14:34.760]  under los angeles and when that starts happening the animal start running out of the area and well
[14:34.760 --> 14:40.920]  you know what happens next and it's the only area on the ring of fire globally even the u.s
[14:40.920 --> 14:47.080]  geological survey admits this that has not triggered yet you've been seeing all the massive
[14:47.080 --> 14:53.640]  earthquakes the last eight years on the ring of fire all the way around the pacific and those plates
[14:54.200 --> 14:58.120]  the only place that has it triggered is right there and it's two years overdue
[15:00.600 --> 15:06.440]  but that's okay just say it's a conspiracy theory that that we are on big plates floating on
[15:06.440 --> 15:12.920]  ocean of magma and just say it doesn't exist don't say that the yellowstone isn't right rising and
[15:12.920 --> 15:18.280]  lowering in different areas and that mount st helens is now becoming a little more active than
[15:18.280 --> 15:23.160]  it was it's it's been quote dormant now they're arguing whether it's becoming active again oh
[15:23.160 --> 15:30.280]  it's active remember what mount st helens did in fact you can go on youtube and get footage of
[15:30.280 --> 15:39.480]  mount st helens eruption but you know what none of this matters what matters is confederate flags
[15:39.480 --> 15:49.960]  and katlyn jenner so that's coming up and uh new wiki leaks document reels nsa spied on top
[15:49.960 --> 15:54.840]  french companies yeah and it's not like it's spied on the companies to give it to us companies they
[15:54.840 --> 15:59.320]  give it to globalist companies and then move it to china move it to india and that's one reason
[15:59.320 --> 16:02.840]  you have to pretty much move to china or india because the globalists have development zones
[16:02.840 --> 16:09.720]  with those corrupt basically oligarchies whatever you want to call them tyrannies india is a tyranny
[16:09.720 --> 16:15.720]  as well not like it's bad as china but it's a tyranny and they go there because you have to
[16:15.720 --> 16:19.320]  work with the globalist or they won't ever let you basically bring anything to market
[16:19.960 --> 16:24.360]  that's what globalism is they don't just rig things with cheap labor and with internal tariffs
[16:24.360 --> 16:30.760]  against western goods and the taxes and all the rest of it they don't let you operate and they
[16:30.760 --> 16:36.360]  move your stolen designs to china where no one can stop them and they put you out of business
[16:37.240 --> 16:42.840]  that's the plan for world government and if you try to have an economy and try to become
[16:42.840 --> 16:48.840]  free market and try to reform yourself from a communist totalitarian command and control regime
[16:48.840 --> 16:55.880]  like russia they send in over 300 NGOs and spend 25 billion dollars in the last decade
[16:55.880 --> 17:02.760]  trying to collapse russia and then if russia doesn't like it and kicks the admitted certified foreign
[17:02.760 --> 17:11.400]  spies out they'll arrest them russia's called totalitarian let me tell you if they got russian
[17:11.400 --> 17:16.520]  spies running around trying to overthrow my country i see any of them i'm gonna punch them in the nose
[17:17.160 --> 17:22.280]  see i'm a sovereign nationalist folks i believe in a free country that i defend
[17:22.280 --> 17:29.480]  and i've got skin in the game this corrupt disgusting decadent bloated
[17:29.480 --> 17:35.080]  diseased demonically possessed country is a shell of its former self but i still love it and want
[17:35.080 --> 17:39.880]  to resuscitate it and then i see the globalists that have destroyed us trying to destroy russia
[17:39.880 --> 17:45.400]  and it makes me sick and i do feel a kinship with anyone being preyed upon by these people
[17:45.400 --> 17:56.360]  like i do for christians in syria or in iraq or in libya or in egypt where our filthy evil
[17:56.360 --> 18:03.240]  globalist controllers our occupiers are funding the prosecution of an ethnic cleansing operation
[18:03.240 --> 18:08.840]  against christians i feel kinship with anybody under attack from our enemy because we're under
[18:08.840 --> 18:14.520]  attack these are the people that feed us gmo and put glyphosate in our water supply and hydra
[18:14.520 --> 18:21.000]  floracistic acid and put our kids on all these drugs we are under attack this is a world government
[18:21.000 --> 18:26.600]  already in place playing countries off against each other sucking them dry sucking all the energy
[18:26.600 --> 18:34.200]  and wealth and patents and creativity and brains all the brain trust up into its globalist panopticon
[18:34.200 --> 18:42.040]  mother ships that are above the law the city of london washington dc new york city the vatican
[18:42.040 --> 18:49.160]  israel and i'm not saying the vatican's totally bad or israel's totally bad or new york's totally
[18:49.160 --> 18:54.920]  bad or dc's totally bad or the city of london's totally bad or the un's totally bad what do all
[18:54.920 --> 19:00.600]  these groups have they're above the law sovereign diplomatic community and allow the globalists
[19:00.600 --> 19:10.520]  to have redoubts switzerland let's list all of them luxenberg monnie carlo grand cayman cook islands
[19:10.520 --> 19:17.000]  the vatican switzerland israel city of london district of columbia
[19:19.800 --> 19:25.720]  above the law diplomatic community their own systems and above it all the united nations
[19:25.720 --> 19:30.920]  and the imf the world bank the international bank of settlements the xm bank all run by the
[19:30.920 --> 19:38.040]  same 200 people or so establishing this whole program bringing america down bringing russia down
[19:38.040 --> 19:42.840]  bringing china down siphoning off all the energy of the hardworking chinese to help
[19:42.840 --> 19:47.720]  bankrupt all the other nations playing us all off against each other in a symphony of destruction
[19:48.600 --> 19:52.440]  and once you understand the enemy program and the attack profile they can be defeated
[19:53.320 --> 19:58.920]  world government and the central banks are our mortal enemies not other countries not other races
[19:58.920 --> 20:04.200]  not other people it's time to build your own emergency food stockpile with the industry leader

[24:31.960 --> 24:41.640]  so
[24:44.120 --> 24:51.160]  for those out there that think we live in boring times you must be asleep at the switch we live
[24:52.200 --> 25:01.320]  in incredibly dynamic dangerous times and many times over the years i've been out with friends
[25:01.320 --> 25:07.000]  on their boats water skiing for years i had a glass tron ski bump and never had time to go out
[25:07.000 --> 25:13.400]  and use it so i got rid of it but there'd be a few times i was out on it and my dad was driving
[25:13.400 --> 25:19.240]  or i was driving and a boat turned when the lake was busy or i was getting near a sand bar
[25:19.880 --> 25:27.240]  and somebody says hey look out you know your 200 yards from land or look out for that boat look
[25:27.240 --> 25:34.200]  out for that sailboat and i didn't get mad at them and say you're an alarmist you're a fearmonger
[25:34.200 --> 25:39.000]  even though most of the time i was already turning back from getting a soft drink or whatever
[25:39.720 --> 25:45.320]  behind me or telling one of my kids not to you know stand up in the back whatever the distraction
[25:45.320 --> 25:51.800]  was i'd be turning back i had usually already turned i was already making a turn
[25:51.800 --> 26:00.920]  but still it was good that they were watching well what if your dad said hey look out you're
[26:00.920 --> 26:05.880]  going towards the land or look out for that boat and i said be quiet conspiracy theorist
[26:06.680 --> 26:11.880]  it's not good to have your eyes open it's not good to be vigilant even though the price of liberty
[26:11.880 --> 26:20.920]  is eternal vigilance just go to sleep you would run into the land at 50 miles an hour and probably
[26:20.920 --> 26:24.680]  kill everybody or you'd run into somebody else's boat and kill them
[26:27.400 --> 26:31.960]  and politically we've watched the social engineers the globalists who've announced themselves
[26:31.960 --> 26:38.520]  as the enemy of humanity that's how arrogant they are destroy nation after nation suck them dry
[26:39.080 --> 26:46.280]  and tell us how they deserved it and now they're setting the west up for a economic depression
[26:46.280 --> 26:52.440]  and financial consolidation that will make the great depression pale in significance
[26:52.440 --> 26:59.000]  and i'm simply here saying strap yourselves in make preparations get ready for a crash landing
[27:00.120 --> 27:06.760]  i hope we can get the plane up and it doesn't hit the ground i hope we pull out of this
[27:06.760 --> 27:12.440]  and it's just a global recession but that's not what the controllers want they want a controlled
[27:12.440 --> 27:23.400]  engineered global collapse and the only way they're going to back off is if it's exposed that
[27:23.400 --> 27:28.440]  they're in control and they stand again and that they've engineered this which has come out in the
[27:28.440 --> 27:33.960]  imf and world bank documents it's come out the financial times of london cnbc you name it that
[27:33.960 --> 27:40.120]  they do run things and that they are consolidating power and taking over their competition and being
[27:40.120 --> 27:46.760]  bailed out via too big to fail during these crises it is a fact should i play cnbc again
[27:46.760 --> 27:52.440]  with their panel of five people including the host all agreeing that we're slaves to central bankers
[27:54.680 --> 27:59.400]  while we're busy digging up confederate war generals and trying to rename military bases
[28:00.600 --> 28:03.160]  and trying to ban the sale of flags at walmart
[28:03.160 --> 28:12.920]  aren't we are becoming true slaves to a cashless society high tech system that jacks our food and
[28:12.920 --> 28:23.480]  water and is 10 times more scientific and evil than the most wicked slave master of the past i mean
[28:23.480 --> 28:29.800]  hands down the current major threat let's just say they were as evil as evil slave owners
[28:29.800 --> 28:34.520]  would we obsess over the old slave owners who aren't in front of our eyes
[28:35.400 --> 28:40.040]  or we obsess over the new ones we would obsess over the new ones but see we're all
[28:40.040 --> 28:45.800]  told to obsess over things that don't matter so while we live in la la land and fight with each
[28:45.800 --> 28:53.800]  other like a group of idiots the establishment is completing the final stages of their planetary
[28:53.800 --> 29:06.680]  takeover we stand at the precipice now we're going to go to break i'm going to come back and hit
[29:07.480 --> 29:09.160]  our most important current news
[29:12.680 --> 29:19.080]  and that of course is the former cia head said i wouldn't be surprised if terror attacks hit the
[29:19.080 --> 29:24.280]  u.s over the fourth of july weekend we have the video and that ties into some other important
[29:24.280 --> 29:32.120]  reports then we're going to expand back into what's happening in the middle east and how
[29:32.120 --> 29:36.200]  that ties together then what's happening with the european central banks that actually own our
[29:36.200 --> 29:41.240]  fellow reserve then we're going to look at what world war three would look like from time magazine
[29:41.240 --> 29:50.040]  and more plus vicious videos of psychopathic police attacking restrained prisoners on the march
[29:50.040 --> 29:55.400]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[29:59.960 --> 30:07.400]  who do you prefer barack obama for george dubby of bush well if you haven't figured it out by now
[30:07.400 --> 30:13.480]  these guys are corporate spokesmen they're not leaders i mean they both started illegal wars
[30:13.480 --> 30:19.080]  hell they both tortured people they bailed out criminal corporations and they spied on you
[30:19.080 --> 30:24.920]  they both violated the constitution and they even committed war crimes so what's it going to take
[30:24.920 --> 30:30.840]  i mean what will it take to finally wake you up think about it if joseph stalin ran for president
[30:30.840 --> 30:37.720]  as a democrat and adolf hitler ran as a republican one of them would end up leading our country
[30:37.720 --> 30:44.920]  its politics incorporated and your choice between the two parties is a myth because in reality it
[30:44.920 --> 30:52.760]  is a two-party tyranny with one ideology divide and conquer so join the revolution and break the
[30:52.760 --> 31:01.640]  false left versus right paradigm info wars dot com another major health threat this one in teledo

[36:19.800 --> 36:27.240]  i keep saying we've never had specials this good i began to get more involved in marketing the last
[36:27.240 --> 36:31.800]  few years i just used to just put stuff up there and hope it paid the bills and as we tweak things
[36:31.800 --> 36:35.960]  and as we get even more hardcore free market we just get more successful by the grace of god
[36:35.960 --> 36:41.160]  and they say necessity is the mother of invention we've expanded info wars i have a bigger nut to
[36:41.160 --> 36:46.840]  crack every month with payroll and servers and the building and the equipment and all of it
[36:48.360 --> 36:54.040]  and so i've set out to not let the media intimidate me that being successful is bad when they wish
[36:54.040 --> 37:00.360]  they were successful and we are by the grace of god sustaining ourselves and growing a little bit
[37:00.360 --> 37:05.880]  so i'm doubling down hiring more reporters more editors more video people you've heard the announcements
[37:06.600 --> 37:09.880]  that's a job in itself going through the folks and hiring them will probably have between
[37:09.880 --> 37:15.640]  five and ten people i'm looking at our budget but we know it's up to us to really take on the
[37:15.640 --> 37:20.280]  globalist be able to send reporters all over the world i want to be able to send reporters to europe
[37:20.280 --> 37:26.760]  to track this collapse that's going on that will undoubtedly lead to here but that takes money
[37:26.760 --> 37:32.280]  i'm tempted to go to europe for a week or so and then go to greece and go to spain where i believe
[37:32.280 --> 37:36.520]  the next collapse is coming and most analysts do and to go to england the city of london where
[37:36.520 --> 37:44.200]  they actually run the thing and to go to roam where they've installed the you know the leader of
[37:44.200 --> 37:53.800]  roam is a former goldman sacks director i mean this is world events that are happening the
[37:53.800 --> 37:59.240]  globalist a hundred years in the making and it's coming to a head it is legendary it is over the
[37:59.240 --> 38:07.720]  top it is epic it is historical all those words don't bring justice to it when you realize how

[39:53.240 --> 39:59.960]  it's the play that you don't go 100 plus percent when i was a kid i hear 110 and think that doesn't
[39:59.960 --> 40:05.640]  exist but in the human body it does we have a governor where most people can actually go 200
[40:05.640 --> 40:11.160]  or 300 percent when it comes to weightlifting or things like that there's another 10 percent when
[40:11.160 --> 40:17.000]  it comes to running that's really true that you have a governor in you that keeps you at what you
[40:17.000 --> 40:22.680]  think's 100 so you never even get near the hundred but you decide to shoot for 150 percent that's how
[40:22.680 --> 40:29.160]  you trick the brain to go to 110 so the globalists are doubling down right now because they're in
[40:29.160 --> 40:34.040]  trouble but they're dangerous and we're not beating them we finally are contending with them in a
[40:34.040 --> 40:39.400]  death struggle i mean we're in a fight they're bloodied we're bloodied it's on you got to go 110
[40:39.400 --> 40:44.520]  percent don't worry about getting hurt because the minute you get intimidated the minute you don't go
[40:44.520 --> 40:49.720]  110 percent the minute you don't switch on and get in the zone is the minute you're going to get run
[40:49.720 --> 40:56.280]  over and hurt we got to commit spiritually and intellectually to go 110 against these people
[40:56.280 --> 41:02.200]  and to not be cowards so i'm not mincing words i'm not pulling back i'm not holding reserves
[41:02.200 --> 41:08.360]  i'm all in i'm not worried about nothing because before my god and my family i'm going to be a real
[41:08.360 --> 41:15.240]  human and a real american like my ancestors and i'm not going to be a coward i'm going all in
[41:15.240 --> 41:20.520]  everything all in because let me tell you this is the moment we're entering the next few years
[41:20.520 --> 41:25.720]  and the decade after that but it's it's not hey it's coming hey the event horizon hey the threshold
[41:25.720 --> 41:31.880]  is closed and i've been telling you for years we now are crossing the line we're now steaming
[41:31.880 --> 41:39.720]  into the waters folks and there be monsters get ready see monsters to use the sea analogy
[41:39.720 --> 41:43.800]  that have already wrecked countless nations and killed hundreds of millions of people
[41:43.800 --> 41:52.760]  we are now in their territory they've now come to us and they claim this is their territory the
[41:52.760 --> 41:57.240]  only reason we have any basic freedom the only reason we have any basic private property is
[41:57.240 --> 42:04.760]  ancestors 800 years ago we're willing to stand up against the power elite we're willing to stand up
[42:04.760 --> 42:11.400]  against the establishment and we're willing to die so that they had basic freedoms and out of
[42:11.400 --> 42:22.680]  magna carta grew everything we see today that merged with uh judaic and christian law which
[42:22.680 --> 42:30.120]  were very similar to british common law and gave us what we have today and there's been a fight
[42:31.800 --> 42:34.920]  to bring in roman law babelonian law
[42:34.920 --> 42:49.640]  law the kings ever since and we're here now we've now we've now come to the crossroads
[42:49.640 --> 42:54.280]  we're now at the crossroads we're now at that magic moment in history
[42:54.280 --> 43:02.840]  800 years of magna carta on the 16th of this month a week and a half ago
[43:09.480 --> 43:15.800]  this will be a day long remember you can feel it in your bones you can see it in the streets
[43:15.800 --> 43:21.080]  you can see it in the news you can see it unfolding everywhere we're in a death battle
[43:21.080 --> 43:27.640]  battle and i just cannot stress that to people enough we are in a death battle
[43:29.640 --> 43:33.160]  excellent science fiction movie came out a year and a half two years ago
[43:35.640 --> 43:41.800]  oblivion not even a fan of tom cruise but it was excellent till they got to the cheesy you
[43:41.800 --> 43:52.040]  know classic hollywood ending stuff and i'll give you this allegory again and i'm going to spoil the
[43:52.040 --> 43:58.120]  movie for you if you haven't seen it right now it's basically 80 something years i go from memory
[43:58.840 --> 44:05.320]  after the moon gets hit by a giant asteroid and blown into pieces that causes earthquake
[44:05.320 --> 44:14.040]  seas to flood breakdown but then the surviving humans after 90 plus percent die from starvation
[44:14.040 --> 44:20.600]  and war over the resources that are left a decade later ships land and astronauts
[44:21.800 --> 44:26.360]  copies of astronauts that were picked up by the spaceship coming in you know
[44:26.360 --> 44:36.200]  uh light years out have mass replicated them and drones and attack the survivors and the
[44:36.200 --> 44:41.800]  survivors are programmed and still believe that they're basically astronauts who are fueling their
[44:41.800 --> 44:50.600]  spaceship up in orbit it's a big pyramid three-sided pyramid and it's sucking the oceans up
[44:50.600 --> 44:58.840]  and has these big factories built on the ground that they use drone humans humanoids to build
[44:59.880 --> 45:03.480]  and they think they're actually you know just leaving the earth they don't know they're actually
[45:03.480 --> 45:08.360]  they're killing the earth and sucking up the water turning into hydrogen propellant to send
[45:08.360 --> 45:18.040]  the parasite robot ai off to the next planet and it's the greatest allegory i've ever seen
[45:18.040 --> 45:23.080]  because that's what the new world order does it floats above the earth above the law a globalist
[45:23.080 --> 45:27.960]  operation the people serving it think they're trying to save the earth and bring global peace
[45:27.960 --> 45:31.480]  and the elite have decided to merge with machines and become god and leave the planet
[45:33.160 --> 45:37.640]  and they've got all these people that have drone programming and might as well be clones
[45:38.600 --> 45:46.600]  working for each other a year before oblivion even came out i designed a graphic that i said was key
[45:46.600 --> 45:49.640]  that described the new world order master plan
[45:52.760 --> 45:59.720]  DARPA the real skynet the end of humanity rise in the robots was the article info wars.com
[46:02.600 --> 46:06.520]  and then of course you go see the movie and it's basically the same creature and that's because
[46:06.520 --> 46:09.160]  it's an arc type and it's what they're manifesting
[46:09.160 --> 46:17.400]  it's the real deal and again i want to be clear to the new york times where they misinterpret
[46:17.400 --> 46:22.360]  this i'm not saying it's really aliens i'm not humans are master builders what we envision we
[46:22.360 --> 46:28.360]  end up creating or more the elite are envisioning this so of course in movies they're giving you
[46:28.360 --> 46:34.120]  revelation of the method of what they're actually planning they believe the earth is untenable
[46:34.120 --> 46:40.840]  they're going to suck and extract resources off elysium another example go off world to build
[46:40.840 --> 46:48.520]  their golden fields because they believe in the program to wipe out humanity because we might
[46:48.520 --> 46:53.720]  contend with them and not let them have their master plan they believe in that war against
[46:53.720 --> 46:58.280]  humanity they may actually destroy the planet i mean that's how whacked out of their minds they are
[46:58.280 --> 47:03.800]  and that's because the entity or the spirit or the archetype the mass consciousness whatever it is
[47:03.800 --> 47:09.720]  that's driving them really just wants to kill the planet finally the bible says that but they
[47:09.720 --> 47:13.800]  have this delusion that they're going to kill the planet and then they're going to get off of it and
[47:13.800 --> 47:19.800]  be okay we're not meant to save the planet we're meant to leave the planet how many movies have
[47:19.800 --> 47:27.240]  we been told that in no we're meant to save the planet and beyond that because we do
[47:27.240 --> 47:32.520]  because we decide that we have a destiny we're not just programmed by you new world order
[47:32.520 --> 47:38.360]  we see your mind we see your dreams that are nightmares to us and they may be heavenly to you
[47:38.360 --> 47:45.000]  but they're not we don't think hell raisers and owners manual we don't think hitler was cute or
[47:45.000 --> 47:50.600]  stalling or the new world order or cia black torture sites we reject you we don't want to be
[47:50.600 --> 47:59.560]  part of that now we see the headlines from associated press zero had you name it yesterday
[47:59.560 --> 48:04.440]  who could have foreseen it the greek bailout didn't work and of course zero had just been
[48:04.440 --> 48:08.520]  sarcastic that the media is everywhere going who could have thought Reese would fail who could
[48:08.520 --> 48:12.920]  have thought this would have happened who could have thought derivatives will be a problem who
[48:12.920 --> 48:17.640]  could have thought sticking your hand in a meat grinder might not feel good who could have thought
[48:17.640 --> 48:21.960]  shooting yourself in the head of the 12 gauge wouldn't feel good who could have thought isis
[48:21.960 --> 48:28.200]  would have reconstituted and attacked us i mean al qaeda was beaten after 13 years and now they're
[48:28.200 --> 48:33.320]  back with a new name the same flag rampaging everywhere they were the free syrian army our
[48:33.320 --> 48:38.200]  buddies and now they're the enemy oh but turkey's going to invade they've announced syria to take
[48:38.200 --> 48:45.160]  out the Kurds who were fighting al qaeda known as isis but don't worry i mean we told you over
[48:45.160 --> 48:49.640]  and over again they're then going to have them attack first the middle east some areas of europe
[48:49.640 --> 48:54.600]  i even predicted france uh north africa and then when they attack they'll quote take our liberties
[48:54.600 --> 48:58.840]  away to keep us safe from the attacks and now like clockwork that's happened and they set up
[48:58.840 --> 49:02.760]  there the mind-numb public saying who could have imagined who could have thought i mean this is
[49:02.760 --> 49:07.880]  like watching paint dry it's so easy to know what's happening this is like one is two plus two equal
[49:07.880 --> 49:13.000]  four but that's the ability to be free that's why obama says it equals five you go but that's
[49:13.000 --> 49:19.320]  outrageous they're meant to break your will they've got to be outrageous and have the surgeon general
[49:19.320 --> 49:26.760]  talking about five-year-olds masturbating it's meant to jack with you it's a joke our gross
[49:26.760 --> 49:33.400]  domestic product is now an olympic man who's turned into a woman who cares how's that going to save us
[49:33.400 --> 49:42.600]  from ai how does that give us the answer the unified field theory i don't care i don't hate you i
[49:42.600 --> 49:51.720]  don't love you i don't care stop forcing your weirdness on me sex i mean maybe like if they had
[49:51.720 --> 49:56.520]  the potty poop party or something where everybody talked about i can go to the bathroom wherever
[49:56.520 --> 50:03.880]  i want or something sexual and bodily functions is only one part of me i'm pointed at the stars
[50:03.880 --> 50:09.800]  i'm pointed at incredible discoveries i'm pointed at humans actualizing the power to
[50:09.800 --> 50:16.440]  instantaneously create as our creator has given us the power to grow into that's what i'm into
[50:17.240 --> 50:20.520]  not having our destiny taken control of and being run into the ground
[50:22.760 --> 50:28.200]  can you imagine in the future if we survive this looking back on the mind control obsessing over
[50:28.200 --> 50:35.480]  dead confederate generals and and rebel flags and and and transvestites and trannies i mean
[50:35.480 --> 50:42.600]  can you really imagine that what if we blow the earth up and don't make it how are you then gonna

[53:57.720 --> 54:15.720]  I read the news today about a lucky man who made the grave
[54:15.720 --> 54:29.240]  and the news was rather sad well i just had to laugh i saw the photograph
[54:30.680 --> 54:39.640]  i saw the photograph john lennon what a magical voice he blew his mind out in a car
[54:39.640 --> 54:43.160]  oh
[54:43.160 --> 54:53.160]  he didn't notice that the lights had changed no he didn't a crowd of people stood instead
[54:55.400 --> 55:01.160]  they'd seen his face before nobody was really sure he was from the house of
[55:01.160 --> 55:10.040]  love i saw humanity is so beautiful so great so good i just want to see it built up and strong
[55:11.000 --> 55:14.520]  the english army had just won the war
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.880]  the crowd of people turned away
[55:19.880 --> 55:28.920]  but i just have to look having read the
[55:34.040 --> 55:38.760]  let's go ahead and get into the news here then we'll get into just over the top
[55:38.760 --> 55:43.400]  it's the only word i got there's three articles today on obama power grabbing and it's it's what
[55:43.400 --> 55:49.480]  we thought but i mean it's even more inventive and wicked and evil than i thought they would do i
[55:49.480 --> 55:55.160]  mean it's just nine times out of ten things are worse than i say and i used to get accused
[55:55.160 --> 55:58.360]  of exaggerating a lot because people didn't actually read what we were getting into but
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.960]  that's the it's on purpose to be over the top again
[56:03.800 --> 56:09.320]  to just overwhelm you and break your will and at a genetic cellular level it hasn't broken my will
[56:10.040 --> 56:15.560]  but i just already know all this is coming so it's almost like we can't oppose it because
[56:15.560 --> 56:21.240]  we've been fighting it so long we just expect that we've made preparation for it in our hearts and
[56:21.240 --> 56:27.720]  minds and that's why they tell you what they're going to do to you even though it can unravel
[56:27.720 --> 56:35.240]  their plan is because humans are designed to adapt evolve overcome to their environment
[56:36.120 --> 56:42.120]  even if it's a scientific takeover so they've tricked us in algorithm to adapt to our slavery
[56:42.120 --> 56:47.080]  and i know i say that all the time because a very high-level globalist very sickeningly
[56:47.080 --> 56:53.080]  schooled me for about an hour on a three-hour flight to new york first class
[56:56.200 --> 57:00.760]  i've told this story many times but it's key i didn't even get it till i got off the plane
[57:02.280 --> 57:05.640]  and he said you think people are gonna adapt when they have this information resist
[57:05.640 --> 57:16.200]  they're going to adapt to it and he was slick he was smart he was good looking
[57:16.920 --> 57:22.280]  you know he was everything and it was just funny to him that his suit looked perfect
[57:22.280 --> 57:27.080]  his overcoat looked perfect i wouldn't even know how to look like that and that he could just
[57:27.080 --> 57:37.480]  arrogantly laugh at me when he walked off the plane and so many lay average folks would say to me
[57:38.600 --> 57:42.040]  oh yeah you really talk to this person they would really talk to you like that
[57:42.040 --> 57:47.160]  there's a whole nother world out there when you're a quote journalist
[57:47.160 --> 57:58.520]  a pundit when people know you live and die by not breaking confidences that the people will say
[57:58.520 --> 58:06.600]  this soft record right and i'll go yep and they'll go okay you're gonna fail it's like when i had
[58:07.240 --> 58:12.200]  15 years ago these things thomas barnett i'm going from memory just like that one of the
[58:12.200 --> 58:16.360]  heads of one of the war colleges and he'd done a c span thing about how the military works for
[58:16.360 --> 58:20.440]  world government now there's a global government takeover and how great it is enjoying with sauron
[58:20.440 --> 58:24.360]  with all these top generals watching him and he wouldn't come on once he figured out i was alex
[58:24.360 --> 58:29.080]  jones not alex s jones of the new york times with the other alex jones and he goes you fail
[58:29.080 --> 58:34.840]  nothing can stop us i mean it was almost like emperor palpatine to yoda saying you cannot win

[1:01:59.880 --> 1:02:05.560]  ah that's what you think you have nothing you'll never stop us i mean it was very palpatine-esque
[1:02:05.560 --> 1:02:10.840]  and and you can go to ted tv and see his big talk that's that that's how he acts he's all yes
[1:02:10.840 --> 1:02:19.320]  uh and it's inevitable join with it oh yes but and then i said harmon was it you right on the show
[1:02:19.320 --> 1:02:23.400]  back then i know you've been here about 15 years but i couldn't remember i knew it was right around
[1:02:23.400 --> 1:02:30.600]  9 11 thomas p.m uh barnett's globalization how we join with the world government i mean just type
[1:02:30.600 --> 1:02:37.800]  in his name go read about it this is just one of these guys just one of these guys harmon also heard
[1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:43.720]  roth cup and again he was the head of the kissinger group at the time and he didn't say it was off
[1:02:43.720 --> 1:02:47.800]  record so he you know harmon heard all that where he was like well i thought you might want to join
[1:02:47.800 --> 1:02:51.480]  with us i mean you're a reasonable guy you're part of the superclass leading the conspiracy
[1:02:51.480 --> 1:02:54.920]  theorist you know alice we're just trying to build a better world and that's why i came on but it's
[1:02:54.920 --> 1:03:01.080]  obvious that i wasted my time uh harmon did you not hear those conversations i absolutely that is a
[1:03:01.080 --> 1:03:07.800]  true story and um we'd get these guys on the line and they'd kind of start to uh change their tune
[1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:13.480]  once we they either figured out what show they were coming on and that uh you're you're uh
[1:03:13.480 --> 1:03:19.560]  you know global views didn't line up with theirs exactly to the t and uh they uh we get spooked
[1:03:19.560 --> 1:03:23.960]  off and there was other times where you'd bring out a guest and his lawyer would pop on the air
[1:03:23.960 --> 1:03:27.560]  oh you can't see that you can't say it and shut down the interview oh yeah like the time we had
[1:03:27.560 --> 1:03:32.680]  the director of harp on eos yes alice we actually ignite the sky by the way i like your show the
[1:03:32.680 --> 1:03:38.280]  guy was a fan the scientist and then the air force colonel comes on and shuts the interview off
[1:03:38.280 --> 1:03:42.680]  by the way we ought to find that and play it it's like 12 years ago it's an amazing interview
[1:03:42.680 --> 1:03:46.920]  you were there for that weren't you harmon absolutely they got really friendly and said oh
[1:03:46.920 --> 1:03:51.560]  you can come up and they invited you up there and said oh we'll show you around and we have nothing
[1:03:51.560 --> 1:03:56.920]  to hide oh you know i really should have gone no one gets invited into harp and people thought
[1:03:56.920 --> 1:04:02.280]  that interview was fake but it was because the technical director the civilian director was a
[1:04:02.280 --> 1:04:09.080]  listener i mean you can't make this stuff up harmon yeah this this is real i mean this is
[1:04:09.080 --> 1:04:15.240]  real radio jones is in uh austin texas and i'm just at a mixing board and i would call up a guest
[1:04:15.240 --> 1:04:21.080]  get him on the line the real guy and uh i mean this is do you remember barnett though basically
[1:04:21.080 --> 1:04:26.040]  cackling like palpatine at me absolutely it was just like i'm not going to do this interview and
[1:04:26.040 --> 1:04:32.200]  we're and i said hold on the line and as soon as we were going to break um i patched you guys in
[1:04:32.200 --> 1:04:38.920]  and uh yeah he just uh those remarks that is just uh was uh very bizarre he just changed his tune and
[1:04:38.920 --> 1:04:44.280]  hung up so do you remember him going like ha ha you will be defeated absolutely absolutely made
[1:04:44.280 --> 1:04:49.560]  some comment about how uh you're not going to win and that was it hung up the phone yeah yeah i mean
[1:04:49.560 --> 1:04:54.200]  i'm literally fighting with people that are taking over america and on off the other like you will
[1:04:54.200 --> 1:04:59.800]  win you'll be defeated i mean that's who we're fighting these are villains folks do you think you
[1:04:59.800 --> 1:05:03.800]  might be on a terror watch list because you don't like what the government's doing well you might be
[1:05:03.800 --> 1:05:07.880]  right in the article law enforcement more concerned about anti-government activists than al-qaeda
[1:05:07.880 --> 1:05:11.880]  terrorists curt nemo writes about a study conducted by the triangle center on terrorism and homeland
[1:05:11.880 --> 1:05:15.800]  security that reveals law enforcement agencies in the united states are more concerned about
[1:05:15.800 --> 1:05:20.760]  anti-government extremists than al-qaeda or isis inspired terrorism they perceive violent extremism
[1:05:20.760 --> 1:05:24.680]  to be a much more severe threat nationally than the threat of violent extremism in their own
[1:05:24.680 --> 1:05:29.240]  jurisdictions the report reads law enforcement agencies in the united states consider anti-
[1:05:29.240 --> 1:05:33.640]  government violent extremists not radicalized muslims to be the most severe threat to political
[1:05:33.640 --> 1:05:37.800]  violence that they face this comes on the heels of house democrats demanding that the obama
[1:05:37.800 --> 1:05:42.520]  administration issue an updated assessment on the dangers posed by violent right wing extremist
[1:05:42.520 --> 1:05:46.120]  groups and provide the department of homeland security with more resources to deal with the
[1:05:46.120 --> 1:05:50.280]  supposed threat so i guess if you're a conservative that doesn't like the government arming isis
[1:05:50.280 --> 1:05:54.280]  then you might be a threat to the government rob do reporting for info wars dot com and info wars

[1:11:40.360 --> 1:11:46.440]  want to play that clip and with cnbc admitting we're all slaves to international banks central banks
[1:11:48.360 --> 1:11:54.120]  this is a design program where they build it too big to fail set up the system and have a
[1:11:54.120 --> 1:12:00.280]  cascade of collapses that consolidate world power until they appoint the leaders of greece they
[1:12:00.280 --> 1:12:04.120]  appoint the leaders of italy they appoint the leaders in latin american countries and they
[1:12:04.120 --> 1:12:09.480]  basically select the leaders here that's all coming up but first here's jim rogers how is that
[1:12:09.480 --> 1:12:15.080]  going to affect the economy there well of course it's going to affect it badly if you cannot get
[1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:20.840]  the money you cannot spend it and we're not not reverting to our border economy yet anyway but no
[1:12:20.840 --> 1:12:25.560]  of course the grease of greek economy is going to collapse this week and probably for a while
[1:12:25.560 --> 1:12:30.520]  people are terrified and you would be too so would i know i mean what about the overall picture here
[1:12:30.520 --> 1:12:37.080]  grease we see the very same preparations they made in greece before the bank holiday the not
[1:12:37.080 --> 1:12:43.160]  letting folks get their money out or 66 euros a day being set up all over the western world we
[1:12:43.160 --> 1:12:48.920]  see elites ringing the alarm bells so they can act like they warned us but you warned us uh i guess
[1:12:48.920 --> 1:12:54.040]  14 years ago um i want to give you the floor for the eight minutes before break or i'll interrupt
[1:12:54.040 --> 1:12:57.720]  the whole time i want you to really give us the state of the world you've predicted this all very
[1:12:57.720 --> 1:13:01.880]  accurately in your books in your articles i want to talk about where we are right now financially
[1:13:01.880 --> 1:13:07.320]  then i want to look at your expert breakdown of the clintons and the bushes and the elections
[1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:14.040]  coming up here thanks for joining us thank you very much for for having me on alex um i i'm
[1:13:14.040 --> 1:13:20.520]  going to start then with um how our current big banking system culminated in the last well basically
[1:13:21.160 --> 1:13:28.280]  since their appeal of glass steagle act in 1999 but but really uh in the last 14 years there has
[1:13:28.280 --> 1:13:34.040]  been immense consolidation at the hands particularly the big six banks in the united states that's
[1:13:34.040 --> 1:13:40.920]  schoolman sacks morgan stanley bank of america city group jp morgan chase and wells fargo in two
[1:13:40.920 --> 1:13:45.640]  different stages the first stage um really relates a little bit of what you're talking about before in
[1:13:45.640 --> 1:13:50.360]  terms of international security and those kinds of issues that you discussed which was in the 2001
[1:13:50.360 --> 1:13:56.760]  2002 period when the enron scandal was breaking when the world comp scandal was breaking after banks
[1:13:56.760 --> 1:14:02.280]  had consolidated their first element of power in the wake of the glass steagle act being repealed
[1:14:02.280 --> 1:14:07.720]  under the clinton administration 1999 and enabling them therefore to become bigger and more concentrated
[1:14:07.720 --> 1:14:15.080]  and more in control of our capital worldwide those scandals were masked by ultimately 9 11 um and
[1:14:15.080 --> 1:14:19.400]  what happened in iraq while that was going on while attention was focused there something else
[1:14:19.400 --> 1:14:24.360]  happened in the united states which is that rates were cut bank started to accumulate more leverage
[1:14:24.360 --> 1:14:30.280]  trade more riskily and so forth in bigger fashion enabled by government policy enabled by the federal
[1:14:30.280 --> 1:14:36.920]  reserve policy this went on until we saw the break in 2007 2008 with the global financial crisis in
[1:14:36.920 --> 1:14:43.320]  which we are still consumed as a result of that phase right the global financial crisis beginning
[1:14:43.320 --> 1:14:48.280]  on the back of these banks concentrating their capital at the hands of government and federal
[1:14:48.280 --> 1:14:55.640]  reserve policy as well as global associated policy we had this financial catastrophe since then and
[1:14:55.640 --> 1:14:59.560]  this is important because it sets us up to what's happening in Greece and what's going on in europe
[1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:07.320]  and globally since then our big six banks the ones that were at the pinnacle at the crux at the at
[1:15:07.320 --> 1:15:15.000]  the creation of the financial crisis have grown just the us six banks have grown in assets by 42
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:23.560]  percent they have grown in deposits our deposits by 86 percent and their cash reserves because
[1:15:23.560 --> 1:15:31.000]  a federal reserve and other zero interest rate and quantitative easing policy are 400 percent
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:40.600]  larger so they are in despite that a tremendously precarious position and want more because they
[1:15:40.600 --> 1:15:45.320]  have wanted more and it's not just the big six banks the united states but they have really benefited
[1:15:45.320 --> 1:15:51.080]  the most from what's happened since the financial crisis globally in terms of their own concentration
[1:15:51.080 --> 1:15:56.280]  and power and and as i just mentioned the assets deposits and the cash that they have it's also a
[1:15:56.280 --> 1:16:01.320]  global phenomenon of course with the ECB and so forth so what has been seven years of enabling
[1:16:01.320 --> 1:16:07.720]  them to have zero interest rate cash to accumulate their own reserves to pretend that they are
[1:16:07.720 --> 1:16:12.760]  solvent because that was supposedly why the federal reserve stepped in to give them this gift of
[1:16:12.760 --> 1:16:17.480]  liquidity and cheap money which has really hurt everybody else we get nothing on our savings
[1:16:17.480 --> 1:16:22.760]  accounts we pay banks to hold our money and now they're talking about ways to bail in or continue
[1:16:22.760 --> 1:16:28.200]  to hold our money if there is another phase of this crisis which there will be now we turn over
[1:16:28.200 --> 1:16:33.480]  to what's happened since this accumulation has gone on in this phase to what's going on in Greece
[1:16:33.480 --> 1:16:41.560]  today in 2000 a Greece actually had the same debt to GDP ratio which was around 100 not great but the
[1:16:41.560 --> 1:16:48.840]  same as what France has today as what France the the sort of epicenter of core european power
[1:16:48.840 --> 1:16:55.960]  with Germany has today they had lower unemployment they could manage their funds they were actually
[1:16:55.960 --> 1:17:02.040]  okay but in the wake of the 2008 crisis when all banks around the world were looking to batten down
[1:17:02.040 --> 1:17:08.680]  the hatches and control capital and receive these benefits of low interest rate and and buying of
[1:17:08.680 --> 1:17:14.680]  their bonds and creation of more debt to go through the banks to then be repurchased by the Fed
[1:17:14.680 --> 1:17:20.440]  in quantitative NACB in quantitative easing programs places like Greece which is the epicenter
[1:17:20.440 --> 1:17:26.840]  obviously tragedy today have had to deal with the fallout so whereas today the blame the sort of
[1:17:26.840 --> 1:17:31.480]  perception is that that Greece couldn't manage its finances that its pensioners are lazy that
[1:17:31.480 --> 1:17:38.040]  its workers don't do anything the reality is in 2008 Greece was fine and as part of the global
[1:17:38.040 --> 1:17:44.600]  financial crisis a consolidation of control and capital and policies away from places like Greece
[1:17:44.600 --> 1:17:52.920]  it bore the brunt of downgrades of austerity programs of the acquisition in return for bailout
[1:17:52.920 --> 1:17:59.960]  funds of their country and as a result their country weakened any country would they were downgraded
[1:17:59.960 --> 1:18:06.520]  six times between 2011 2010 and 2011 during this part of this crisis while they were given bailout
[1:18:06.520 --> 1:18:11.560]  money while the terms of that bailout money from the Troika from the ECB and IMF and so forth were
[1:18:11.560 --> 1:18:17.560]  so heinous that all they did and I looked at my website actually I wrote a piece on this to break
[1:18:17.560 --> 1:18:23.480]  in 2012 February 2012 said the Greek tragedy is just beginning and it's on my thoughts page
[1:18:23.480 --> 1:18:30.520]  somewhere on my website but but the reality is it was beginning because it was the epicenter
[1:18:31.720 --> 1:18:37.640]  of this process of controlling a country's capital by forcing that country into not just
[1:18:37.640 --> 1:18:42.520]  austerity but into depression now there's lessons from the depression analysis this
[1:18:42.520 --> 1:18:47.080]  analysis is really cool that you mentioned this in the beginning of of your intro to me I appreciate
[1:18:47.080 --> 1:18:54.600]  it in the great depression the first one in the 30s that was catalyzed by the big six banks in the
[1:18:54.600 --> 1:19:00.520]  United States in the 1929 crash and and people were trying to get their money out of banks because
[1:19:00.520 --> 1:19:06.360]  at the time there was no deposit insurance and no banks were big and powerful and their leaders
[1:19:06.360 --> 1:19:10.040]  were associated with Washington and governments throughout the world they didn't have anywhere
[1:19:10.040 --> 1:19:14.920]  near as much power as they have today because at that point the Federal Reserve was still in its
[1:19:14.920 --> 1:19:21.080]  infancy and it didn't stick along with the ECB which didn't exist then seven trillion dollars worth
[1:19:21.080 --> 1:19:24.120]  no I mean we've got to go to break come back with this key point after we return
[1:19:24.760 --> 1:19:27.960]  but I just want to point out that's what we had you on I remember having gone when you
[1:19:27.960 --> 1:19:32.920]  wrote that article three years ago but even before that predicting all of this but here's the key you
[1:19:32.920 --> 1:19:39.480]  just calmly drop that bombshell which is public information but nobody's talking about it they've
[1:19:39.480 --> 1:19:44.600]  now had banker bailouts worldwide with our tax money the new model that's not enough they want to
[1:19:44.600 --> 1:19:50.360]  keep our money in the account and do a bail in like Cyprus and steal our money publicly
[1:19:51.480 --> 1:19:57.160]  doing what John Corzine only tried to do a few years ago at MF Global I mean this is unprecedented

[1:24:07.560 --> 1:24:13.880]  some of the interview for the obama deception too that i got so busy i never completed we are working
[1:24:13.880 --> 1:24:21.000]  on just releasing it to the public because it needs to be seen and in those videos i just clicked
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:26.440]  and i just remembered she laid out everything and predicted what would happen in greece is now
[1:24:26.440 --> 1:24:31.480]  happening and talked about how it's premeditated and again she worked at the highest levels inside
[1:24:31.480 --> 1:24:37.480]  these organizations but regardless of whether it's premeditated or not we know it is the same effect
[1:24:37.480 --> 1:24:42.760]  they're too big to fail they create the derivatives we bail out the banks then our nation states
[1:24:43.320 --> 1:24:48.760]  go into default because we bailed them out that's the biggest part of it and we're being
[1:24:48.760 --> 1:24:55.640]  maneuvered towards a global collapse which will give them even more power 2008 was just the global
[1:24:55.640 --> 1:25:02.760]  positioning for this and now the installation of world leaders under banker technocratic control
[1:25:02.760 --> 1:25:09.480]  their words not mine and the arrogance of the EU same as the american union or tpp same people
[1:25:10.280 --> 1:25:15.640]  threatening greece you you better not have a referendum no me prince joins us was managing
[1:25:15.640 --> 1:25:20.120]  director at goldman sacks new book all the president's bankers this is a short segment long
[1:25:20.120 --> 1:25:26.280]  segment coming up but you you got cut off going through a parallel of the same big five six mega
[1:25:26.280 --> 1:25:32.280]  banks in the depression who had up the private federal reserve that's their government quasi
[1:25:32.280 --> 1:25:38.120]  government consortium for those that don't know running the same playbook now but on a global
[1:25:38.120 --> 1:25:44.760]  scale but back then the us wasn't tied under an international bank of settlements so i love
[1:25:44.760 --> 1:25:48.760]  watching international bank of settlements a few days ago go all the global meltdowns coming
[1:25:48.760 --> 1:25:53.000]  it's terrible the federal reserve and other central banks did a bad job when they represent
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:58.120]  these people i mean i love watching them cattle on themselves playing on the public's financial
[1:25:58.120 --> 1:26:03.560]  illiteracy yeah no that that's that's what's amazing there they're 85th annual report the
[1:26:03.560 --> 1:26:07.800]  bank of international settlements which ties into that depression period so again those big six
[1:26:07.800 --> 1:26:12.600]  banks the federal reserve in its infancy our government at the time crash in 1929 happens
[1:26:12.600 --> 1:26:18.120]  people can't get their money so basically at the end of that people try to get their money we get
[1:26:18.120 --> 1:26:24.760]  deposit insurance we get a glass seagull act pass we we have some control over the division of our
[1:26:24.760 --> 1:26:30.120]  deposits our money from the rescue transactions and consolidation of the bigger banks and it
[1:26:30.120 --> 1:26:35.080]  worked for a number of decades but that started to dissipate in the 70s 80s and so forth that's when
[1:26:35.080 --> 1:26:40.360]  bail and economics started and what bail and economics which is a combination of the private
[1:26:40.360 --> 1:26:45.560]  banks and and leading these institutions as you mentioned as well as the governments as well as
[1:26:45.560 --> 1:26:50.600]  these the central bank institutions and the bis and the imf and so forth they now use the bailout
[1:26:50.600 --> 1:26:58.760]  as a way to put themselves into it hold us hostage to them through the fdic and similar systems
[1:26:58.760 --> 1:27:03.480]  well exactly and actually that was one of fdr's main concerns at the time put in the fdc because
[1:27:03.480 --> 1:27:07.720]  people were scared he wanted banks to be able to sit you know to have people's money protected
[1:27:07.720 --> 1:27:10.840]  otherwise they wouldn't put money in the bank so in a way it was helping the banks on the other
[1:27:10.840 --> 1:27:16.680]  hand he was concerned that this could happen because now our money is kind of hostage well it
[1:27:16.680 --> 1:27:21.000]  is actually hostage to this greater leverage in these greater plans and it has become that so when
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:25.320]  you see now what's going on in Greece where they had to they had no choice but to install capital
[1:27:25.320 --> 1:27:30.360]  controls that is reminiscent of the pre-great depression glass seagull days when people were
[1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:33.800]  trying to get money out of banks and they had no recourse at the time and when banks went under
[1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:38.360]  their money was just simply gone and now we see that happening in Greece clearly we see the
[1:27:38.360 --> 1:27:42.760]  preparations being made for this all over the west can you speak to that and what you think that
[1:27:42.760 --> 1:27:47.720]  signifies well what it signifies is that Greece is in this position where it's defending itself
[1:27:47.720 --> 1:27:52.920]  against these these egregious bailout terms that were put upon it to begin with as a result of
[1:27:52.920 --> 1:27:57.800]  capital you know killing them and then coming out in the 2008 period in the financial crisis so you
[1:27:57.800 --> 1:28:02.200]  know the big banks these institutions they want they wanted money from Greece they wanted Greece
[1:28:02.200 --> 1:28:05.560]  and now they have Greece in a chokehold and Greece is trying to do anything that can't
[1:28:05.560 --> 1:28:10.520]  to protect itself in the great depression what Greece did was it left its tie to the British
[1:28:10.520 --> 1:28:16.120]  pound on the British pound devalued it floated the drachma it sorted out its own economics and it
[1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:21.080]  actually flourished relative to the rest of Europe before a lot of the great depression was over
[1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:24.920]  relative to other countries so i mean i have a mechanism for but the point of the balance the
[1:28:24.920 --> 1:28:31.320]  point of going after cash is is bigger because what can now happen is large banks forgot the small
[1:28:31.320 --> 1:28:35.800]  ones in in in Greece but large banks like city group can go to well they they they are part of
[1:28:35.800 --> 1:28:39.080]  go to the federal reserve talk to the government say you know what we need to have mechanisms to
[1:28:39.080 --> 1:28:44.120]  control cash right now in case something like oh there as you know i covered it two weeks ago
[1:28:44.120 --> 1:28:49.240]  they're now speaking of city when you show that headline saying we need to control the cash to
[1:28:49.240 --> 1:28:55.160]  decide where it's spent and when just bizarre totalitarian statements negatively in the opening
[1:28:55.160 --> 1:28:59.880]  showing their trial ballooning right and rather than you know looking at Greece is something that
[1:28:59.880 --> 1:29:04.760]  requires leadership and fixing and and and you know the fact that these these bailout terms were
[1:29:04.760 --> 1:29:09.480]  egregious and austerity was to begin with they're using it and they will use it they will use it
[1:29:09.480 --> 1:29:16.920]  as an example of why these cash control mechanisms should be infused because the reality is they are
[1:29:16.920 --> 1:29:23.000]  not solvent after seven years of zero interest rate policy liquidity infusions from the central
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:27.880]  banks a seven trillion dollar book between the ECB and the federal reserve supporting the private
[1:29:27.880 --> 1:29:32.840]  banking system and these big banks even with that even with 400 percent more power than they have
[1:29:32.840 --> 1:29:36.680]  before even with less loans to people no me stay there i'm gonna give you the floor when we come
[1:29:36.680 --> 1:29:41.320]  back to roll with this i don't want to get into politics uh and how they're maneuvering their people
[1:29:41.320 --> 1:29:47.240]  in like a don king boxing match where they win either way stay with us i'm alex jones in full wars
[1:29:47.240 --> 1:29:55.400]  dot com we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:29:59.320 --> 1:30:02.600]  do you think you might be on a terror watch list because you don't like what the government's
[1:30:02.600 --> 1:30:07.000]  doing well you might be right in the article law enforcement more concerned about anti-government
[1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:10.680]  activists than al-qaeda terrorists kurt nimo writes about a study conducted by the triangle
[1:30:10.680 --> 1:30:14.600]  center on terrorism and homeland security that reveals law enforcement agencies in the united
[1:30:14.600 --> 1:30:19.320]  states are more concerned about anti-government extremists than al-qaeda or isis inspired terrorism
[1:30:19.320 --> 1:30:23.800]  they perceive violent extremism to be a much more severe threat nationally than the threat of violent
[1:30:23.800 --> 1:30:28.680]  extremism in their own jurisdictions the report reads law enforcement agencies in the united states
[1:30:28.680 --> 1:30:33.240]  consider anti-government violent extremists not radicalized muslims to be the most severe threat
[1:30:33.240 --> 1:30:37.560]  to political violence that they face this comes on the heels of house democrats demanding that the

[1:34:21.720 --> 1:34:29.080]  the exact same thing the opposite of what mainstream media tells you and now i asked you
[1:34:29.080 --> 1:34:35.320]  decades into this who was right the nomi prince the dr paul craig roberts the ron paul's ron paul

[1:34:49.800 --> 1:34:53.400]  finish up a point that got caught off by the break talk about where all this is going and
[1:34:53.400 --> 1:34:59.640]  talk about the mindset of these people because we had joseph sticklets on 2002 2006 you've had them
[1:34:59.640 --> 1:35:06.200]  on five six times two-time Nobel prize winner former head of economics of economics head
[1:35:06.200 --> 1:35:12.520]  economist at the world bank and he basically admitted here this is a planned takeover and
[1:35:12.520 --> 1:35:18.440]  that it's very immoral he didn't want to be part of it he left in 2002 nomi left goldman sacks around
[1:35:18.440 --> 1:35:24.600]  the same time so there was already corruption and problems and greed in global banking but it got
[1:35:24.600 --> 1:35:31.000]  really draconian around 2002 according to greg palis and other investigative journalists it really
[1:35:31.560 --> 1:35:37.800]  started getting bad and it's bipartisan across the world or tripartisan or quad partisan in like
[1:35:37.800 --> 1:35:43.480]  germany where there are four major parties three major parties in england two here and they just
[1:35:43.480 --> 1:35:52.040]  buy you off we've had hundreds of senior bankers killed arkansas and and all of this is building
[1:35:52.040 --> 1:35:56.520]  towards the head we're going to go back to our guest here in a moment her new book all the
[1:35:56.520 --> 1:36:03.960]  president's bankers the hidden alliances that drive american power i remember mainline republican
[1:36:03.960 --> 1:36:11.080]  oid talk show host 15 years ago saying i was a coup kind of liar and that there didn't even exist
[1:36:11.080 --> 1:36:16.520]  a council on foreign relations and that there were no global banks and global government now it's
[1:36:16.520 --> 1:36:23.000]  all pretty much out in the open but they first created a politically correct stigma towards
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:27.160]  criticizing it that stigma is kind of over in fact you guys have the famous there's a bunch
[1:36:27.160 --> 1:36:32.360]  of these clips but the msnbc where it's like five minutes long and all five of the pundits and the
[1:36:32.360 --> 1:36:39.240]  guest a host all agree that aren't we just slaves to central bankers and then they admit it we'll
[1:36:39.240 --> 1:36:46.280]  cue that up so so this is the big enchilada and they don't want to fix things because every crisis
[1:36:46.280 --> 1:36:51.720]  that comes they get more power we're going to go back to numy in a moment but get her book read it
[1:36:51.720 --> 1:36:56.840]  give it to friends and family pretty soon it'll be a conspiracy theory that people ever even read
[1:36:56.840 --> 1:37:02.680]  or that women gave birth vaginally or breastfed i mean or that seeds weren't gmo i mean i'm not
[1:37:02.680 --> 1:37:09.160]  joking this is a hardcore scientific takeover but before we go any further in the entire
[1:37:09.160 --> 1:37:13.560]  month of july i've decided to launch it a day early we've never done this for a whole month

[1:39:06.600 --> 1:39:12.760]  exposing the globalist exposing their paradigm this is huge getting people outside the matrix
[1:39:14.680 --> 1:39:20.680]  we're building towards that vieja vendetta moment but not an explosive violent moment but a
[1:39:20.680 --> 1:39:28.680]  revelation i was thinking about then we're going to our guest doing a piece like how ranch dressing
[1:39:29.480 --> 1:39:33.960]  could save the world and that's the kind of thing that'll wake up the sheeple they'll see a
[1:39:33.960 --> 1:39:38.680]  headline like that i'm sure somebody else will do this now that's fine and then the sheeple will
[1:39:38.680 --> 1:39:44.520]  click on that and i'll say that's right no one knows when people in the 80s started putting ranch
[1:39:44.520 --> 1:39:51.560]  dressing on pepperoni pizza mainly but now most major change and most restaurants offer it because
[1:39:51.560 --> 1:39:57.880]  it's popular no one knows it started it but it started with one person and now it's ubiquitous
[1:39:57.880 --> 1:40:03.640]  all over the world not just here you know why does that matter it doesn't but i've talked to top nsa
[1:40:03.640 --> 1:40:07.720]  insiders on air and off air we've had william benning the former technical director right here
[1:40:07.720 --> 1:40:13.720]  of two feet from me sitting here i've i had james bamford on i had his countless whistleblowers on
[1:40:13.720 --> 1:40:19.880]  20 years ago i did not engage in espionage against the criminal globalist i was approached at
[1:40:19.880 --> 1:40:24.600]  movie theaters where i did showings a few times and the rodeo by people claiming they had worked
[1:40:24.600 --> 1:40:30.280]  with the nsa and they would explain to me just like in a vieja vendetta moment where the cops
[1:40:30.280 --> 1:40:36.280]  were being talked to by v at the park and they told me it's about stealing other country's data
[1:40:36.280 --> 1:40:40.360]  and giving it to the globalist to build in china it's about destroying the free market it's about
[1:40:40.360 --> 1:40:45.000]  if strawberries are trending this was i was actually told this as an example getting ahead of the
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  trend and being able to dominate it's about shutting down trends that threaten the globalist
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:53.240]  or disruptive technology to their takeover and i kind of knew that but here they were telling me
[1:40:53.240 --> 1:40:57.320]  and in your scientific atlantic cable boxes are listening to you break one open on air and i did
[1:40:57.320 --> 1:41:02.760]  it was there and just on and on on the tv's already have microphones in them boom they were now it's
[1:41:02.760 --> 1:41:07.560]  all admitted and i'm talking about in the parking lot three minute conversations twice
[1:41:09.640 --> 1:41:14.760]  and like here's the technicals of the time warner system wired into the nsa and i called my dad he
[1:41:14.760 --> 1:41:18.200]  goes throw it away throw it in the trash can don't even look at it because it was true and they
[1:41:18.200 --> 1:41:25.400]  arrest you for that folks i don't even know it was a setup but the point is that that's the world
[1:41:25.400 --> 1:41:31.240]  where i live okay and now it's all come out and and and this is a total takeover
[1:41:33.560 --> 1:41:36.840]  and a lot of people gone through hell to bring you this information
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:42.840]  and now it's all coming out in the open because they're going to launch their final phases
[1:41:42.840 --> 1:41:47.000]  of the takeover now i've been ranting you got the floor for the 10 minutes left in this segment
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:51.400]  in six minutes the next no me friends all the president's bankers no me prints dot com
[1:41:51.400 --> 1:41:56.440]  um we should republish an info wars your article from three years ago predicting the whole gree
[1:41:56.440 --> 1:42:00.920]  situation in fact i'm going to do that now uh and put a link to your side at the bottom of it
[1:42:00.920 --> 1:42:06.760]  um but we've got interviews with you not just on radio but here in studio uh talking about i'm
[1:42:06.760 --> 1:42:11.000]  going to put that out in the next few days it just reminded me but no me you've heard my rant
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  here about where we stand do you think i'm wrong that they're lined up for their next big takeover
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:21.640]  their next big phase they're they have the pope calling for global government i mean it's getting
[1:42:21.640 --> 1:42:25.720]  really obvious now private central banks are going to implode the world economy
[1:42:25.720 --> 1:42:31.720]  and offer a new global s dr digital currency uh that pegs all the other currencies and they're
[1:42:31.720 --> 1:42:38.200]  getting ready for the final crisis to bring in their total takeover or is there another crisis
[1:42:38.200 --> 1:42:43.640]  after that go ahead yeah i was just listening to you alex and then when you said final crisis i'm
[1:42:43.640 --> 1:42:48.280]  not quite sure if there is a final one i i think you know as you as you capped off there there
[1:42:48.280 --> 1:42:54.040]  there could be a series of crises but but yes what has happened um and this has been decades in the
[1:42:54.040 --> 1:42:59.560]  building but more accelerated uh since the financial crisis 2008 because that was just the most recent
[1:42:59.560 --> 1:43:07.320]  inflection point of the most epic and unprecedented even with the bis the bank of international
[1:43:07.320 --> 1:43:12.760]  settlements the central bank of the central bank saying so at this point of subsidization
[1:43:12.760 --> 1:43:17.640]  because that's the first step in control it's always the first step in control financially
[1:43:17.640 --> 1:43:22.840]  um of the private banking slash central banking system they got to get us on the hook for their
[1:43:22.840 --> 1:43:28.600]  crimes well exactly and and this is what's been happening so you know it goes back to uh well it
[1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:34.280]  goes back a lot of ways but but but in the 80s you know we talk about uh ragan's treasury secretary
[1:43:34.280 --> 1:43:40.120]  was the ceo of maryl lynch back then the first ceo from a major u.s bank that was in that position
[1:43:40.120 --> 1:43:46.120]  uh he was friends with uh george hw bush they got together deregulated part of the industry
[1:43:46.120 --> 1:43:51.720]  to allow it to consolidate its power and its capital as a byproduct of that this was around
[1:43:51.720 --> 1:43:57.080]  the time of the latin american debt crisis that was kind of like the current grease in european
[1:43:57.080 --> 1:44:02.200]  and global crisis that we're having today which is that the private banks did a lot of tricky
[1:44:02.200 --> 1:44:07.000]  dealings lavished a lot of debt which was sort of cover for all sorts of other extractions of
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:11.480]  of private assets and other ways of sort of transporting what was in some of these countries
[1:44:11.480 --> 1:44:16.840]  into into their context into their asset base and when that failed when it went belly up when
[1:44:16.840 --> 1:44:22.600]  those countries couldn't sustain the bad terms of the debt that they had these countries came
[1:44:22.600 --> 1:44:25.560]  these banks i'm sorry they're country they are countries they're larger than countries these
[1:44:25.560 --> 1:44:31.400]  banks came to uh the united states government said we need a bailout and under under ragan under
[1:44:31.400 --> 1:44:35.640]  bush under brady under all these people starting in the 80s and then working in through the clinton
[1:44:35.640 --> 1:44:40.760]  administration the 90s the bush and obama administrations more recently they continued
[1:44:40.760 --> 1:44:48.680]  to receive banking subsidies liquidity subsidies capital the purchasing of their crappy toxic assets
[1:44:48.680 --> 1:44:56.520]  the ongoing um aid the ongoing aid to them for the risks they took with our money in
[1:44:56.520 --> 1:45:03.240]  greater and greater ways so the 2008 component of this particular phase of financial crises
[1:45:03.240 --> 1:45:08.040]  and consolidation of control and capital because it is about power and money together those two
[1:45:08.040 --> 1:45:13.560]  things are not distinct um is setting us up for the next phase and as i started to say before
[1:45:13.560 --> 1:45:18.360]  and we talked about it a little bit is is the money aspect um is the only thing that hasn't
[1:45:18.360 --> 1:45:23.960]  really been touched in this particular phase banks have had subsidies they've had liquidity
[1:45:23.960 --> 1:45:28.840]  injections the central banks for a minute said this is great look they're so well capitalized
[1:45:28.840 --> 1:45:33.640]  we put in all these new rules the next time there's a crisis they're going to be fine
[1:45:33.640 --> 1:45:39.480]  but everyone knows at that level those elite levels they are not fine and one of the ways
[1:45:39.480 --> 1:45:43.880]  we know we know publicly on our side of the equation that they are not fine is because they
[1:45:43.880 --> 1:45:49.000]  also want cash um and as i started to say before the the greek situation now putting in capital
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:55.640]  controls to defend itself from the extraction from these policies of taking smaller countries assets
[1:45:55.640 --> 1:46:02.840]  um diluting them and accumulating them outside into the larger more elite countries and governments
[1:46:02.840 --> 1:46:09.160]  and and powerful banks um is something that's going to continue um and so it's a political
[1:46:09.160 --> 1:46:13.800]  aspect it is a power aspect it's a private banking aspect and it is a central banking
[1:46:13.800 --> 1:46:19.640]  aspect all together and it's happening now in an unprecedented way because instead of after the 2008
[1:46:19.640 --> 1:46:27.560]  crisis of defusing this power all of these bodies came together to basically concentrate that power
[1:46:27.560 --> 1:46:31.720]  and that's why in particularly united states and this is really important in particularly united
[1:46:31.720 --> 1:46:37.640]  states banks have concentrated more of their power both politically as well as from a concentration
[1:46:37.640 --> 1:46:44.680]  of capital standpoint relative to europe so whereas before the 2008 crisis there was a sort of mix
[1:46:44.680 --> 1:46:49.640]  between the european banks going nuts with the bets that they were taking and the leverage they
[1:46:49.640 --> 1:46:54.280]  were taking and the problems that they were occurring on the local economies with not lending
[1:46:54.280 --> 1:46:58.920]  to them but instead saving the capital they were getting from their central bank from the ecb to
[1:46:58.920 --> 1:47:03.880]  to solidify themselves and make all of those rulers feel happy and content because it was free
[1:47:03.880 --> 1:47:10.440]  money to them the united states banking system has been the biggest recipient of this global policy
[1:47:10.440 --> 1:47:15.960]  to date so whereas initially going back a couple wars the end of world war one the end of world
[1:47:15.960 --> 1:47:22.040]  war two the united states always became a greater superpower because of its control over bank capital
[1:47:22.040 --> 1:47:28.120]  because of the policies the different entities could aggregate together and ensue upon the general
[1:47:28.120 --> 1:47:32.600]  financial system after world war two of course we got the imf we got the world bank those were
[1:47:32.600 --> 1:47:38.440]  those were mechanisms of deciding which countries would receive aid and which countries would receive
[1:47:38.440 --> 1:47:43.320]  real aid and real aid was cheap money the beginning of a banking-based global government
[1:47:44.120 --> 1:47:49.320]  and now what do you see this new consolidation doing because it looks like this this this big next
[1:47:49.320 --> 1:47:54.680]  epic phase not the final phase but for all intents and purposes the launch of global corporate
[1:47:54.680 --> 1:47:59.480]  government openly let me ask you this question what does it do to america and europe because it
[1:47:59.480 --> 1:48:06.360]  appears in the past they ate latin america africa areas of asia and the third world and old world
[1:48:06.360 --> 1:48:11.560]  now as the world bank document showed in 2002 they want to fully consolidate power here
[1:48:12.440 --> 1:48:18.520]  and have us bail them out yet again then making us their slaves in the process true alchemy
[1:48:19.720 --> 1:48:25.240]  i mean it my point is a lot of people think america being behind the global empire is good but
[1:48:25.240 --> 1:48:31.160]  doesn't the average person just fit the bill well we as as americans by being at the bottom of that
[1:48:31.160 --> 1:48:35.480]  equation you know so when the u.s banking system the political system federal reserve and and and
[1:48:35.480 --> 1:48:40.120]  still these policies across the world sort of control it i mean it was our treasury department
[1:48:40.120 --> 1:48:43.960]  united states treasury department united states federal reserve that incurred these policies
[1:48:43.960 --> 1:48:47.720]  throughout the world it was tim geithner and again who went over to europe and said and and
[1:48:47.720 --> 1:48:52.040]  jack flew afterwards you know you guys have to do these same policies you have to continue them
[1:48:52.040 --> 1:48:56.760]  we need zero interest rate we need you to buy bonds we need you to infiltrate um your policies
[1:48:56.760 --> 1:49:01.800]  which are our policies on a global basis that is control i mean that that is the united states
[1:49:01.800 --> 1:49:07.240]  controlling the equation and in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 we have become more in
[1:49:07.240 --> 1:49:13.080]  control over most of the global financial alchemy as you mentioned it where we don't have the same
[1:49:13.080 --> 1:49:18.120]  control is over through the russian and china the aspects that are trying to independently
[1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:23.960]  create their own trading systems their own currency their own development banks but those are still
[1:49:23.960 --> 1:49:28.600]  small they're still small relative to what's happening on the us european basis where the
[1:49:28.600 --> 1:49:35.880]  us is really controlling the shots because we had the first subsidy program for our private banks
[1:49:35.880 --> 1:49:41.560]  our banks became bigger relative to european banks after the financial crisis our fed has
[1:49:41.560 --> 1:49:45.880]  four and a half trillion dollars of assets on its balance sheet among all sorts of other
[1:49:45.880 --> 1:49:51.800]  plays to to to prop up this this global financial system as per coming from the united states
[1:49:51.800 --> 1:49:56.200]  elements versus of two and a half trillion that's being accumulated at the ecb it will
[1:49:56.200 --> 1:50:01.000]  probably grow to three trillion so what's happening is all of these subsidies are continuing to grow
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:06.680]  all of the central banks led by the united states are continuing to take signals from
[1:50:06.680 --> 1:50:10.600]  the united states and the u.s. government and whether it is an obama administration whether
[1:50:10.600 --> 1:50:15.800]  it is a hillary clinton administration whether it is a jeb bush administration will continue on this
[1:50:15.800 --> 1:50:20.280]  play in this play will continue to consolidate capital and power at the hands of these individuals
[1:50:20.280 --> 1:50:26.920]  who have the most legacy connections historical relationships and and similar ideologies from
[1:50:26.920 --> 1:50:32.840]  a globalist perspective um as the us banks have all right stay there i want to come back and get

[1:55:30.040 --> 1:55:35.000]  on the the generation of the western brain physically this isn't just culture what's
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:41.560]  happening investigative report live we're going to break it down coming up uh nomi there's a quote
[1:55:41.560 --> 1:55:48.840]  on info wars dot com and it's uh if you don't want a man unhappy politically don't give him two

[1:55:56.040 --> 1:56:01.480]  author well you know that's true but you want the illusion of choice and that's what carol quickly
[1:56:01.480 --> 1:56:07.640]  wrote about at georgetown in his secret cia state department published book that ended up going public
[1:56:07.640 --> 1:56:12.280]  tragedy and hope where he admitted we already own both parties we will more so in the future
[1:56:12.280 --> 1:56:17.080]  there will be the illusion of choice we'll have diversionary political battles gay marriage confederate
[1:56:17.080 --> 1:56:24.280]  flags while we take over and move us into a totalitarian system i mean these are admitted
[1:56:24.280 --> 1:56:29.000]  to totalitarians we've got three four minutes to break but break down your excellent article that
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:34.920]  goes over this hillary clinton jeb bush and the big banks all right so the whole idea totalitarian
[1:56:34.920 --> 1:56:39.960]  totalitarian power is about controlling money policy power i mean it's it's all part of the
[1:56:39.960 --> 1:56:44.600]  same equation so if we look at hillary and jeb there are just two examples of two dynasties
[1:56:44.600 --> 1:56:49.000]  that have gotten this right from their perspective not necessarily from our perspective and as you
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:53.800]  mentioned this isn't a left right thing it it doesn't actually matter because both of them
[1:56:53.800 --> 1:57:00.520]  are examples of decades long relationships associations similar ideologies with the largest
[1:57:00.520 --> 1:57:05.320]  banks you look at hillary clinton you find you know you find city group because of the
[1:57:05.320 --> 1:57:09.800]  robert rubin connection which also gets you to goldman sex because of the robert rubin connection
[1:57:09.800 --> 1:57:14.920]  who was the treasury secretary bill clinton who helped get bill clinton into office who helped
[1:57:14.920 --> 1:57:19.720]  wall street galvanized between the initial clinton bid for power and the white house and
[1:57:19.720 --> 1:57:24.680]  we're very successful they have all stayed friends hillary has spoken there bill clinton of course
[1:57:24.680 --> 1:57:28.520]  as we know through the clinton foundation was getting lots of money for speeches elsewhere
[1:57:28.520 --> 1:57:33.640]  while she was both secretary state and later speaking at goldman and other banking uh convention
[1:57:33.640 --> 1:57:38.600]  so that connection those relationships they stay in place that money that power that stays in place
[1:57:38.600 --> 1:57:42.840]  the same token you know jeb bush i mentioned before the merrill lynch connection because back
[1:57:42.840 --> 1:57:47.640]  in the day it was father bush and the former ceo of merrill lynch which is now part of bank
[1:57:47.640 --> 1:57:52.200]  america one of the big sixes who are part of the policy that deregulated the banking system
[1:57:52.200 --> 1:57:56.040]  which when that happens it allows the larger players in the banking system to have more money
[1:57:56.040 --> 1:58:01.320]  and power so the governments in place that help to deregulate the banks both get collaborative
[1:58:01.320 --> 1:58:05.080]  power from that equation know me we've got to go to break and i'll give you the next five minutes
[1:58:05.080 --> 1:58:10.040]  if you can stay with us for 72nd break but i'm putting on screen for tv viewers uh an article
[1:58:10.040 --> 1:58:14.760]  out of the daily mail piles of diamonds and porn concord and caviar haunting images of
[1:58:14.760 --> 1:58:21.160]  crumbling palaces of african dictators uh where despots once lived like emperors the only difference
[1:58:21.160 --> 1:58:25.400]  between these guys in north korean kim jong-un is they don't wear crowns same thing with the
[1:58:25.400 --> 1:58:30.360]  goldman sacks and jp morgan's they've stolen literally thousands of times what these african
[1:58:30.360 --> 1:58:36.520]  dictators did they're just smart and don't really consume so conspicuously but this is
[1:58:36.520 --> 1:58:41.000]  the opposite of free market we'll be back in 70 seconds with our guests to talk about that
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:46.120]  and where this is all going in the predator economy stay with us communications radio network
[1:58:49.240 --> 1:58:53.480]  ladies and gentlemen you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers and sponsors on my
[1:58:53.480 --> 1:58:58.920]  syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website info wars dot com because the companies
[1:58:58.920 --> 1:59:03.880]  i've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they
[1:59:03.880 --> 1:59:09.960]  should be so i refused probably 30 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then about
[1:59:09.960 --> 1:59:16.280]  six months ago we get contacted by head down firearms hd firearms dot com own and run by a
[1:59:16.280 --> 1:59:21.000]  bunch of former navy seals special ops people their veterans their patriots their listeners of the
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:26.280]  radio show and they want to support the broadcast it's always about security whether it's for yourself

[2:00:05.400 --> 2:00:12.680]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[2:00:12.680 --> 2:00:19.960]  he's alex jones all right on the gcn radio now let's go to nomi prince austin here's my three
[2:00:19.960 --> 2:00:23.720]  questions the five that we have left and i really appreciate your time and energy and your struggle
[2:00:23.720 --> 2:00:27.960]  and giving up your career very successful to expose the corruption and not going with the herd
[2:00:29.880 --> 2:00:34.920]  we see port urico saying they're getting ready to go bankrupt like greece we see we know that
[2:00:35.480 --> 2:00:39.640]  most counties and cities and states are worse off than greece and here in the us we look at the
[2:00:39.640 --> 2:00:45.560]  numbers we're signing on to the tpp obama's been given republican power to be a dictator
[2:00:45.560 --> 2:00:51.080]  gotta give the democrats credit for being against that it's just it's true uh as bad as obama is
[2:00:51.080 --> 2:00:55.880]  the republican leadership is just just as bad or worse we're in so much trouble where is this all
[2:00:55.880 --> 2:01:02.440]  going yeah i mean it's going to another another phase of the crisis that we're currently in all
[2:01:02.440 --> 2:01:07.720]  all of what you mentioned is is this is this movement of money and power away from well into
[2:01:07.720 --> 2:01:11.080]  the hands of those that already have it it continues to be a consolidation so if you look at
[2:01:11.080 --> 2:01:15.240]  port urico you look at greece you look at states you look at municipalities these are all entities
[2:01:15.240 --> 2:01:19.800]  that never had or hadn't had the power to begin with going into this latest phase of the financial
[2:01:19.800 --> 2:01:24.760]  crisis which gave the people at the top the elite bankers and politicians and central bankers the
[2:01:24.760 --> 2:01:31.960]  ability to take more in this period of time are they the new royalty they are the new royalty i
[2:01:31.960 --> 2:01:37.320]  mean that i i consider you know the bushes and the clinton's uh the same type of a monarchy is i mean
[2:01:37.320 --> 2:01:41.240]  actually more dangerous monarchy than you know anybody sort of you know the queen of england
[2:01:41.240 --> 2:01:47.320]  why because they control our capital you know all the old leaders and even what they were associated
[2:01:47.320 --> 2:01:53.080]  with over the centuries of monarchies did not control to the same extent the future capital
[2:01:53.080 --> 2:01:57.400]  because they didn't have the leverage they didn't have the ability to fictitiously create money
[2:01:57.400 --> 2:02:03.080]  and then spread it into the most powerful financial privates bodies in order for them to continue to
[2:02:03.080 --> 2:02:08.760]  amass control and to concentrate their their power over us we have fewer banks now than we had then
[2:02:08.760 --> 2:02:13.560]  we have more concentrated capital and power therefore than we had then so so yes it's it's a
[2:02:13.560 --> 2:02:18.280]  form of a monarchy it's a form of a totalitarian totalitarian government but it's also something
[2:02:18.280 --> 2:02:22.760]  that's continuing so i mean as i said a few years ago about greece as i said you know 12 years ago
[2:02:22.760 --> 2:02:26.040]  about what was going to happen in the financial sector how that was going to implode and and
[2:02:26.040 --> 2:02:31.560]  reconcentrate because that is what happens every time something negative happens financially in
[2:02:31.560 --> 2:02:37.400]  the world the people in power use it leverage the way to concentrate power this is will they get away
[2:02:37.400 --> 2:02:42.520]  this time with even a bigger power grab and bail out and grabbing our cash how will the government
[2:02:42.520 --> 2:02:47.080]  spend that i guess with some form of civil emergency or launch a war to get us to support
[2:02:47.080 --> 2:02:51.800]  the government well honestly depends on how much we are willing to take it because well not necessarily
[2:02:51.800 --> 2:02:56.360]  but what what it what it looks like will happen to be by how much we take it that our cash our
[2:02:56.360 --> 2:03:01.320]  money those deposits trillions and twenty dollars of deposits are the only thing on our side of the
[2:03:01.320 --> 2:03:06.440]  equation right now relative to the seven trillion from the two major central banks to all the policies
[2:03:06.440 --> 2:03:11.080]  to all the concentration power all those meetings in basal to everything that happens we are the
[2:03:11.080 --> 2:03:15.960]  only counteraction right now and yes that is why our money is at risk because there's nothing else
[2:03:15.960 --> 2:03:21.560]  to take there's no other plan so this is the plan there is no it's not a conspiracy there's no
[2:03:21.560 --> 2:03:27.720]  other way that's right and you to make it work we have a banking dictatorship no better in fact
[2:03:27.720 --> 2:03:33.800]  worse is more sophisticated the north korea's dynasty than african dictatorships we now have
[2:03:33.800 --> 2:03:38.840]  absolute criminals in control bipartisan and it's time to wake up and realize they're illegitimate
[2:03:38.840 --> 2:03:45.160]  because they want to wreck us for full control that's why africa and latin america are so poor
[2:03:45.160 --> 2:03:54.040]  their elites like to keep you poor ours are bigger so so you agree with that statement in 60 seconds
[2:03:54.040 --> 2:03:58.680]  dummy friends dummy friends dot com how do we stop them what do we do well again we have the power
[2:03:58.680 --> 2:04:02.040]  of our own money we have the power of our own vote we have the power of our own voice and that's
[2:04:02.040 --> 2:04:06.440]  really the only thing we can do we have the power of the truth behind us it's really hard this is
[2:04:06.440 --> 2:04:11.720]  this gets to be a harder fight every single day because we are on the losing side of a capital
[2:04:11.720 --> 2:04:16.840]  and power grab that has policy behind it that has that has those those institutions behind it that
[2:04:16.840 --> 2:04:22.440]  we are not but we are we do have ourselves and we do have our collective voices our collective cash
[2:04:22.440 --> 2:04:25.720]  our collective way of not keeping it in the biggest banks and put it again in small and
[2:04:25.720 --> 2:04:31.160]  backs banks are our ability to take it out of the market rather than be the backside of what is
[2:04:31.160 --> 2:04:35.480]  going on in terms of this accumulation of capital and power and so that is something that we have
[2:04:35.480 --> 2:04:40.760]  to be aware of we have to understand it's a truth it's not it's not a myth it's actually happening
[2:04:40.760 --> 2:04:44.360]  and we have to take control of our own cash our own voices our own assets that's right
[2:04:45.240 --> 2:04:48.840]  they want to take the cash because we can still vote for it with our dollars with our
[2:04:48.840 --> 2:04:53.400]  euros and change things it's the only power we have left that isn't a shooting war we salute
[2:04:53.400 --> 2:04:58.120]  you know me friends you're an amazing patriot for few humanity thank you so much
[2:04:59.160 --> 2:05:04.600]  hey daniels info wars dot com i came across some statistics from a gun control group which
[2:05:04.600 --> 2:05:10.840]  state that 12,558 people were killed after being shot last year now let's assume that's true but
[2:05:10.840 --> 2:05:16.600]  let's also compare them to other statistics such as the fact that guns prevent an estimated 2.5
[2:05:16.600 --> 2:05:23.400]  million crimes a year let's take 2.5 million and divide that by 12,558 what do we come up with
[2:05:23.400 --> 2:05:31.000]  199 in other words guns are used around 199 times more often to prevent crime than to kill even if
[2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:36.760]  we were to say double the number of people shot and killed last year to around 25,000 that would
[2:05:36.760 --> 2:05:42.520]  still mean that guns are used nearly a hundred times more often to prevent crime regardless
[2:05:42.520 --> 2:05:48.280]  it's a huge number to say the least and to say that guns are used more often for good than bad
[2:05:48.280 --> 2:05:53.400]  is a complete understatement also be sure to subscribe to our new youtube channel which is

[2:09:02.760 --> 2:09:07.960]  foreign the flavoring but we already know so enjoy the flavor we're going to get the real
[2:09:07.960 --> 2:09:12.600]  solution which is going to be a combination of death panels and and sales taxes i'm consistently
[2:09:12.600 --> 2:09:18.200]  pro-death i'm for assisted suicide i'm for regular zoas and i'm for whatever gets the freeway
[2:09:18.200 --> 2:09:22.440]  moving is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient
[2:09:23.000 --> 2:09:29.800]  would it be better not to lay off the those 10 teachers and to make that trade-off and medical
[2:09:29.800 --> 2:09:34.440]  cost but that's called the death panel uh and you're not supposed to have that discussion
[2:09:34.440 --> 2:09:44.920]  they told me to uh to say that they were sorry but that you had become unreliable
[2:09:48.920 --> 2:09:53.560]  is this the kind of society that you want to live in any kind of society that would do this to its
[2:09:53.560 --> 2:09:59.880]  children will do it to its senior citizens it will do it to its dissidents that kind of society
[2:09:59.880 --> 2:10:05.400]  will also eventually turn on its police on its army on its prison guards on the quizlings
[2:10:05.400 --> 2:10:12.440]  and the collaborators who make that possible this is nothing but a suicide cult the scoops are on
[2:10:12.440 --> 2:10:20.840]  their way the scoops are on their way i repeat the scoops are on their way you will find out why
[2:10:20.840 --> 2:10:36.520]  soylent green means life you will find out why soylent green means death you've got to tell him
[2:10:37.320 --> 2:10:43.400]  you've got to warn him next thing they'll be breeding us like cattle for food you've got to tell him
[2:10:43.400 --> 2:10:51.960]  i'm not name dropping i'm just proud of the fact that i knew charlton hesson interviewed him twice
[2:10:51.960 --> 2:10:57.000]  and talked to him a few times lengthy on the phone not bragging i just love charlton hesson
[2:10:57.000 --> 2:11:02.520]  it's hard for me to play that promo about how soylent green's becoming reality and see charlton
[2:11:02.520 --> 2:11:08.600]  hesson and just i celebrate humanity great poets great actors great scientists but i admire
[2:11:08.600 --> 2:11:15.000]  charlton hesson more because even though he was demonized and attacked he spent over 10 million
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:19.640]  dollars of his own money that's not really known that that's known by inside baseball people
[2:11:21.400 --> 2:11:25.640]  10 million dollars of his own money in that last decade or so flying around on a private jet
[2:11:26.280 --> 2:11:32.760]  giving speeches for the second amendment he wasn't paid by the nr a and by the way 10 million
[2:11:32.760 --> 2:11:36.520]  dollars even though he was been a huge actor back then you got paid maybe half million dollars
[2:11:36.520 --> 2:11:41.720]  for starring in a movie he spent most his money that's why his wife talked trash about him and
[2:11:41.720 --> 2:11:47.400]  stuff once he was senile and rolled him out on tv where he i'm sorry honey then a week later they
[2:11:47.400 --> 2:11:52.440]  announced he totally doesn't even know who he is talk about traitorous rolling out once he doesn't
[2:11:52.440 --> 2:11:58.040]  know who he is to have him denounce everything he stood for i think it was nbc i remember watch
[2:11:58.040 --> 2:12:05.720]  that interview going that's not charlton hesson god i'm hiding these people are sick i just admire
[2:12:05.720 --> 2:12:11.240]  charlton hesson because he was such an honorable person and spent basically his whole fortune
[2:12:11.240 --> 2:12:15.080]  the fight for the second amendment and he was a civil rights activist before it was cool
[2:12:15.960 --> 2:12:19.960]  in oklahoma and alabama that's why they called him racist on tv
[2:12:22.440 --> 2:12:27.480]  see if you get awards from hitler you get put on the cover of time magazine is a great person
[2:12:27.480 --> 2:12:32.040]  margaret singer or if you openly say you want to be like hitler and kill all the blacks and people
[2:12:32.040 --> 2:12:38.520]  then you get adl awards because you're on a sports scenario we fight proto-nazism eugenics that is the
[2:12:38.520 --> 2:12:45.160]  dominant global ideology we are called racist with no proof by msnbc adl southern barbie law center
[2:12:47.880 --> 2:12:53.800]  because they are scum they are traders to humanity they are filth i saw an article i meant to cover
[2:12:53.800 --> 2:12:59.240]  it last week i forget was it in raw story or salon i forget where and it was like alex jones
[2:12:59.240 --> 2:13:06.760]  is a fearmonger he has alarm ads on his show for wireless alarms they say are more effective on a
[2:13:06.760 --> 2:13:11.640]  cell phone based system that's been out for 15 years all the alarm companies sell that but for
[2:13:11.640 --> 2:13:15.720]  like 500 bucks the sponsor of the network has it's not even mine i wish we had them
[2:13:17.080 --> 2:13:21.480]  you could simply say for whatever it's like a fraction of that is just a cell phone system that
[2:13:21.480 --> 2:13:27.480]  calls the police when you see alarm ads on every major channel when they do it's okay
[2:13:27.480 --> 2:13:34.680]  but when we sell alarms it's bad for a lower price well i don't know why i just digressed
[2:13:34.680 --> 2:13:39.240]  off into that but i'm not ashamed of selling things and yes i'm going to tell you why i'm
[2:13:39.240 --> 2:13:43.640]  selling something right now we're funding our operation with hardcore things we use
[2:13:43.640 --> 2:13:46.440]  and i'm not even going to get to the news first cut the bottom of the gammer i'm going to play
[2:13:46.440 --> 2:13:51.720]  the videos of cops going crazy not to demonize police and play into a revolution against police
[2:13:51.720 --> 2:13:55.640]  which is a plan to bring down the country but to understand why the globalists have
[2:13:55.640 --> 2:14:00.440]  changed the hiring process through federal guidelines to produce these type of monsters
[2:14:00.440 --> 2:14:06.280]  to then set up departments we don't expose bad police to demonize all the police
[2:14:06.280 --> 2:14:10.680]  we do it to reform the police and give good police and good people locally a chance to
[2:14:10.680 --> 2:14:17.000]  reform themselves that's what we do that's why the police listen to us and actually
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:20.680]  check out what we're saying if we just attack them they're not going to listen they get driven
[2:14:20.680 --> 2:14:25.720]  in the globalist arms this is all divide and conquer folks so we're going to break that now
[2:14:25.720 --> 2:14:30.120]  we're going to get into the cia former director saying brace for terror attacks over july 4th
[2:14:30.120 --> 2:14:36.120]  from isis and who could have thought well we told you exactly this was all coming and it's not like

[2:18:27.080 --> 2:18:31.240]  just flushes out your gallbladder and so when you come on air and he said maybe i'm kind of shy but
[2:18:31.240 --> 2:18:36.280]  he said it's the swelling the inflammation in my body and i lost like i think he said 14 pounds
[2:18:36.280 --> 2:18:42.280]  in a week he said he was into day nine he's he's going ahead and just still doing the the the
[2:18:42.280 --> 2:18:47.480]  liver shell every day and he looked like a different person he looked 10 years younger i'm not exaggerating
[2:18:48.120 --> 2:18:51.560]  and i i told you this morning try to see if we can twist it more lian's friend
[2:18:52.200 --> 2:18:55.880]  she wants to come on sept contact this one's talking about what it did for her she's real
[2:18:55.880 --> 2:19:00.200]  healthy and she's on other cleanses she says this one blows it away by the way that's sold out the
[2:19:00.200 --> 2:19:06.600]  point is this is real life changing stuff it doesn't mean i'm a beach boy right now after 15
[2:19:06.600 --> 2:19:12.600]  years of killing myself but i've lost 60 plus pounds i'm super muscular with my shirt off
[2:19:12.600 --> 2:19:17.480]  you've people seen photos before and after just in 30-something days doing the last cleanse six
[2:19:17.480 --> 2:19:20.680]  months ago i never ended up doing the cleanse a few weeks ago then for two days and quit i'm
[2:19:20.680 --> 2:19:25.800]  going to do it again next monday but and then do the before and after photos i've even forgot to do
[2:19:25.800 --> 2:19:35.560]  that is this is such an epic time to be alive we can physically come in and do things that aren't
[2:19:35.560 --> 2:19:41.320]  in our diets that aren't in the i mean look young jevity in four self dot com they're beyond
[2:19:41.320 --> 2:19:46.840]  tangy tangerine 2.0 totally organic that's a huge game changer and help me as well it's a lot of
[2:19:46.840 --> 2:19:52.120]  things we don't have the minerals we need but we've launched something here that doesn't well it
[2:19:52.120 --> 2:19:55.240]  affects affects the whole body but it doesn't target the liver doesn't target the heart doesn't
[2:19:55.240 --> 2:19:59.880]  target the kidneys doesn't target the skin even though it does where you really feel it though
[2:19:59.880 --> 2:20:04.120]  is in the brain and i can't wait to hear the reviews for this because i've already seen them in the
[2:20:04.120 --> 2:20:10.760]  office we've had brain force in for three months with different formulas we worked on with the
[2:20:10.760 --> 2:20:16.040]  final formula that we have one of the biggest manufacturers in the country highest quality
[2:20:16.040 --> 2:20:21.880]  totally organic and they said to us this is insane the other leading competitors cost ten
[2:20:21.880 --> 2:20:31.880]  dollars more ten dollars more ten dollars more and have ingredients that aren't as good and
[2:20:31.880 --> 2:20:38.440]  aren't as strong this is undoubtedly better than formulas a hundred two hundred dollars
[2:20:38.440 --> 2:20:44.600]  for twenty nine ninety five it is a total game changer everybody's just too lazy too stupid
[2:20:44.600 --> 2:20:49.000]  too great to do what we're doing we're just vicious free market vicious innovators vicious
[2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:54.760]  vicious vicious total americana brain force is here ladies and gentlemen i've been on this
[2:20:54.760 --> 2:20:59.560]  the last few months you probably notice i've been more crazed more focused less brain fog
[2:20:59.560 --> 2:21:05.800]  more energy more special reports and it's because of brain force now we have a limited first time
[2:21:05.800 --> 2:21:10.280]  run i told you that with the last four products they're all sold out some of them for eight weeks
[2:21:10.280 --> 2:21:17.240]  liver shield all of it it's gone okay and that's because the foodies and the healthies go and
[2:21:17.240 --> 2:21:21.560]  research us go to third party sites read the reviews and discover we're putting out sick
[2:21:21.560 --> 2:21:26.440]  nutraceutical stuff better than what you get at doctor's offices you go to doctor's offices now
[2:21:26.440 --> 2:21:30.360]  and i go to a great one to check my blood and everything now i'm getting older i wanted to
[2:21:30.360 --> 2:21:35.240]  you know get in shape everything checked out they sell stuff similar to this but you got to get a
[2:21:35.240 --> 2:21:39.560]  prescription for it just because it's from a prescription system because they change some
[2:21:39.560 --> 2:21:44.280]  of the enzymes and things they just tweak it so they can say it's prescription people want that
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:51.080]  this ladies and gentlemen brain force is the most insane booster ever and it doesn't have
[2:21:51.080 --> 2:21:56.440]  stimulants it doesn't have garbage in it it has natural things that do it clean i mean what's
[2:21:56.440 --> 2:22:03.240]  that movie i meant to plug it uh limitless yeah limitless where he takes that and then and then
[2:22:03.240 --> 2:22:07.880]  i mean it's not like that but it's the closest thing that i've ever experienced and it's what
[2:22:07.880 --> 2:22:13.720]  god gave us the big pharmacist in the sky and to get you already i've been ranting brain force
[2:22:13.720 --> 2:22:18.840]  a limited supply a very limited run of this is in and when i heard you guys had ordered this
[2:22:19.400 --> 2:22:23.320]  this small amount i just said you know what i got a feeling this is going to be hot
[2:22:25.080 --> 2:22:29.240]  double the next order so this took us months to get in two weeks ago we put in the new order
[2:22:29.240 --> 2:22:33.000]  so when this sells out it'll be a month and a half till we get more so if you want your brain
[2:22:33.000 --> 2:22:37.400]  force get it now Anthony and then we're going to go into what's happened to the brain and the
[2:22:37.400 --> 2:22:42.920]  science of this in the special report but but this is just an example of what these compounds can do
[2:22:42.920 --> 2:22:49.160]  for you and i challenge you to try this formula or to go try one of the ingredients in it separately
[2:22:49.160 --> 2:22:53.960]  in the story you'll be paying the same amount for one ingredient or the store when this is a fusion
[2:22:53.960 --> 2:22:57.960]  anthony guttiarty we formulated this with some of the top formulators in the country
[2:22:58.680 --> 2:23:04.600]  describe what they said to us when we did this that's right and remember a couple months ago
[2:23:04.600 --> 2:23:07.560]  i was speaking to one of the chemists the top chemists in the united states for
[2:23:07.560 --> 2:23:11.560]  nutraceutical formulation on the east coast we're not joking this is really the real deal
[2:23:11.560 --> 2:23:16.040]  and he's used to people coming to him and saying hey look i want a pretty decent formula but i
[2:23:16.040 --> 2:23:20.440]  don't want to pay that much for it i want to cut corners i want to make something that's okay
[2:23:20.440 --> 2:23:25.960]  a dollar a bottle right a dollar a bottle sometimes 70 cents sometimes 50 cents top names right
[2:23:25.960 --> 2:23:30.120]  these are these are huge companies we won't talk about i've been told how they sweep
[2:23:30.120 --> 2:23:33.880]  herbs on the floor with brooms and pick them back up and put them in the conveyor belt so
[2:23:33.880 --> 2:23:38.440]  i mean it's it's straight from china really really bizarre so anyway we come in we say no we actually
[2:23:38.440 --> 2:23:42.680]  want the real deal we want what's comparable to the formulas that are a hundred and two hundred
[2:23:42.680 --> 2:23:47.720]  dollars but we want to make it affordable right so this guy says okay i'll look into it we kept
[2:23:47.720 --> 2:23:52.520]  changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle
[2:23:52.520 --> 2:23:57.560]  for example the l-theonine inside of it that is activated by the different compounds in the urbama
[2:23:57.560 --> 2:24:02.360]  te that we put inside of it as well and all together we put all these 10 different ingredients
[2:24:02.360 --> 2:24:06.200]  you could buy each one of these for about 20 dollars each we put 10 different ingredients
[2:24:06.200 --> 2:24:10.920]  we put it into a 30 dollar bottle and he told me point blank he said look this might be the best
[2:24:10.920 --> 2:24:15.880]  formula i've ever made you should probably order some more and we said oh whatever you know it's a
[2:24:15.880 --> 2:24:21.080]  pretty cool formula then i took the experimental version of it with the graphic designer as well
[2:24:21.080 --> 2:24:27.000]  here at the inform studio's i popped two pills and i was sitting there for about five minutes drank
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:31.480]  some water and i started to feel this really warm energy and you said it best to me earlier you
[2:24:31.480 --> 2:24:35.960]  said it doesn't give you like an energy spike like an energy drink i can't take bad one i can't take
[2:24:35.960 --> 2:24:40.360]  the five-hour stuff and i can't take the red bull because it gives me a dirty energy right right
[2:24:40.360 --> 2:24:46.520]  so that's like a dirty synthetic energy this we want organic based compounds so when you take it
[2:24:46.520 --> 2:24:51.800]  for me i feel sort of tingling in my scalp and that's when i know it's working and i get energy
[2:24:51.800 --> 2:24:56.760]  i get real what i would call like warm natural energy as opposed to like a spike like a freak
[2:24:56.760 --> 2:25:01.400]  out spike when you drink too much energy drinks so to me this is a consistent and sustainable
[2:25:01.400 --> 2:25:05.560]  and you were kind of telling me also one of the worst things with most energy products is it's
[2:25:05.560 --> 2:25:09.560]  not sustainable right you're going to crash afterwards and the cool thing about this is
[2:25:09.560 --> 2:25:14.040]  it's not just a bunch of energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher rpm or
[2:25:14.040 --> 2:25:19.320]  whatever which it does do this is sustainable this isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse
[2:25:19.320 --> 2:25:23.160]  and you're going to feel really bad afterwards this has a bunch of different antioxidants and
[2:25:23.160 --> 2:25:27.720]  compounds and polyphenols and i've been taking it with the x2 which i'm taking right now my water
[2:25:27.720 --> 2:25:32.600]  forgot to take it this morning and i then take it i only take one of the pills a day because i can't
[2:25:32.600 --> 2:25:38.680]  handle it i mean it just and then but the thing is again i've taken natural herbal stuff a few
[2:25:38.680 --> 2:25:42.440]  times to test it out we're thinking about selling and when i was approached for i even put it out
[2:25:42.440 --> 2:25:47.080]  my shelf by third parties years ago and i would you would get me going but then i feel horrible
[2:25:47.080 --> 2:25:50.520]  the next day this doesn't do that yeah exactly and if we want to get into the science of i have
[2:25:50.520 --> 2:25:55.000]  a hole in the stack too that i didn't get a chance to bring in but basically one of these compounds
[2:25:55.640 --> 2:25:59.800]  and it's amazing we're able to bring this to you it's alpha gpc one of the main compounds in
[2:25:59.800 --> 2:26:04.760]  brain force is actually a pharmaceutical drug in europe you cannot get it without a prescription
[2:26:04.760 --> 2:26:09.800]  that's how powerful it is they use it for cognitive health so let's say you go into a doctor i'm not
[2:26:09.800 --> 2:26:14.520]  going to get too persistent we've got it on screen from the encyclopedia alpha gpc you can't tell folks
[2:26:14.520 --> 2:26:18.920]  with that is we got plenty of time you can't get this in europe without a prescription one of the
[2:26:18.920 --> 2:26:24.120]  one one of the 10 ingredients in in brain force is actually a prescription drug and of course the
[2:26:24.120 --> 2:26:29.800]  united states the fda doesn't actually have that much interest in taking the natural compounds unless
[2:26:29.800 --> 2:26:33.400]  the big pharma corporations can make money on it and that's why it costs about 12 million dollars
[2:26:33.400 --> 2:26:39.000]  per prescription oh let's be clear they're trying to move to ban all this oh of course and theazine
[2:26:39.720 --> 2:26:44.520]  actually let's talk about lc9 again so lc9 is one of the main compounds of green tea and that's
[2:26:44.520 --> 2:26:49.240]  what's so interesting to me is that it like i said it's activated from the other ingredient
[2:26:49.240 --> 2:26:53.640]  inside of it so a lot of people say well i take lc9 and i spend 30 40 bucks on the super high
[2:26:53.640 --> 2:26:57.720]  quality form of it and i feel okay i get a little energy but doesn't really work that's because it's
[2:26:57.720 --> 2:27:02.600]  activating itself we're activating the alpha gpc the lc9 we're actually you're giving it the other
[2:27:02.600 --> 2:27:06.760]  things it needs to turn on in the brain and cause the chain reaction exactly and to my knowledge
[2:27:06.760 --> 2:27:12.360]  there's never been an activation complex like this before ever that's why the chemist was so blown away
[2:27:12.360 --> 2:27:17.400]  he said wow you're really gonna because and the chemist all love us because no one wants to let
[2:27:17.400 --> 2:27:22.280]  them do their cool ideas because they all are so cheap they want to just have marketing and have some
[2:27:22.280 --> 2:27:27.560]  you know woman in perfect shape up there and say it did it for them exactly and it's also a weird
[2:27:27.560 --> 2:27:31.560]  thing too because most people think if they're taking a certain compound right that like the alpha
[2:27:31.560 --> 2:27:36.200]  gpc that that's actually what's doing it for them they've already found out that it's actually a
[2:27:36.200 --> 2:27:41.480]  different compound that crosses the blood brain barrier that it is uh increasing this specific
[2:27:41.480 --> 2:27:45.560]  compound into the blood brain barrier all of these do that as well so there's never been
[2:27:45.560 --> 2:27:49.720]  a so really you already had the other thing in you now you take that it triggers exactly so you
[2:27:49.720 --> 2:27:53.960]  put them all in there together it makes sure it works yes and there's some products some ingredients
[2:27:53.960 --> 2:27:57.560]  as well the increased dopamine which is the feel good chemical so some people for example
[2:27:57.560 --> 2:28:01.080]  example the graphic designer and some other people i gave it to they were not even more about the
[2:28:01.080 --> 2:28:05.400]  energy they just said like i just feel happy i just feel good you know i feel like clean good
[2:28:05.400 --> 2:28:11.400]  like a clean energy a clean happiness as opposed to something like you get with an energy drink or
[2:28:11.400 --> 2:28:16.760]  one of those that are basically artificial drugs they order the brain to feel like it but it isn't
[2:28:16.760 --> 2:28:20.840]  the natural feeling right this just increases the compounds you already have the production this is
[2:28:20.840 --> 2:28:23.960]  what you're actually designed to run on exactly it's kind of like a coral run on one form of
[2:28:23.960 --> 2:28:27.800]  junky gas but it runs really good on what it's designed for and that's the principle of info
[2:28:27.800 --> 2:28:32.280]  war's life as far as i understand that you've always had is that it's not about synthetic
[2:28:32.280 --> 2:28:37.640]  chemicals and forcing actions it's about letting your body do its own thing and giving your body
[2:28:37.640 --> 2:28:41.880]  the tools it needs to create these different compounds that are super valuable and super
[2:28:41.880 --> 2:28:46.200]  beneficial and that's why of course in the in the u one of these ingredients is considered a drug
[2:28:46.200 --> 2:28:50.520]  because it actually let your body do its own thing it's really really powerful stuff and i'm
[2:28:50.520 --> 2:28:54.840]  pretty sure that this will be one of the new flagship products for info war's life there's no
[2:28:54.840 --> 2:28:58.680]  question in my mind this will be a best seller and i think it was it was a mess up like the
[2:28:58.680 --> 2:29:02.280]  chemist told us we should have ordered more in the beginning and he was excited about it and now i
[2:29:02.280 --> 2:29:08.120]  realize why taking it it's it's pretty evident to me i think that's also why you've been having
[2:29:08.120 --> 2:29:12.280]  such good shows lately too i remember we talked about earlier your shows have been super powerful
[2:29:12.280 --> 2:29:17.000]  and i wanted to tell people but we weren't ready yet i mean it's it's really helping me yeah i mean
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:20.680]  oftentimes my problem is i don't take my own products i've never been a vitamin mineral
[2:29:20.680 --> 2:29:24.920]  supplement taker so now i kind of sporadically do it and we're trying to get where i always take it
[2:29:24.920 --> 2:29:30.120]  i'm getting better and then it just is amazing info wars live dot com hey bottom line you're

[2:32:16.920 --> 2:32:22.520]  because they are not of the very highest quality or because they're not 100 organic or because they
[2:32:22.520 --> 2:32:28.040]  don't ask all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed in info wars life
[2:32:28.040 --> 2:32:34.120]  dot com whether it's survival shield nascent iodine or dna force super male vitality super

[2:32:41.320 --> 2:32:46.520]  blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited info wars

[2:32:51.880 --> 2:33:08.120]  today and the entire line of groundbreaking cutting-edge hardcore products
[2:33:11.720 --> 2:33:15.640]  look i know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen but it does happen
[2:33:15.640 --> 2:33:19.960]  you're listening
[2:33:22.600 --> 2:33:27.720]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[2:33:30.840 --> 2:33:34.200]  so bottom line we're all about win-win and i'm gonna stop talking about this in a moment but
[2:33:34.200 --> 2:33:40.440]  it's so important high quality water filtration that cuts out the glyphosates and sodium fluoride
[2:33:40.440 --> 2:33:44.680]  that they're putting in there to sterilize us and dumb us down on record find the operation to fight
[2:33:44.680 --> 2:33:49.880]  the enemy while we help people the globalist take your money forcibly with tax money and then use it
[2:33:49.880 --> 2:33:55.880]  to shut down your jobs see we're the opposite of them plus super high quality products at low
[2:33:55.880 --> 2:34:00.760]  prices people love you they become your customers you're successful the old-fashioned way like a
[2:34:00.760 --> 2:34:06.440]  restaurant that has really good food and that cleans its kitchen so folks don't get uh food
[2:34:06.440 --> 2:34:10.280]  poisoning and stop coming to you i mean you know but the globalist again have been insulated from
[2:34:10.280 --> 2:34:15.560]  liability that's why you see it getting so crazy so we also know we have massive liability not not
[2:34:15.560 --> 2:34:19.160]  just that i want to have high quality game changing products that's the real reason but that's why
[2:34:19.160 --> 2:34:23.800]  doing the right thing under god's plans the way to go because then we have the protection because
[2:34:23.800 --> 2:34:29.000]  it's high quality it's all double checked and tested the best labs in the country it's great
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:35.320]  it's affordable it's competitive it funds our operation it's a win-win the old-fashioned americana
[2:34:35.320 --> 2:34:39.160]  way brain force now we're only spend a few more minutes on this and these are stay with us and
[2:34:39.160 --> 2:34:45.800]  shift gears into the terrorism alerts i haven't gotten to the police um just absolutely hiring
[2:34:45.800 --> 2:34:50.680]  more and more psychotic thugs replace the money on video that's some of the most shocking i've
[2:34:50.680 --> 2:34:55.880]  seen in a while but entity you know i'm i'm i'm bumble on here get into all your research get into
[2:34:55.880 --> 2:35:00.120]  what the ingredients are that we think within a year they're already looking at making drugs
[2:35:00.120 --> 2:35:04.520]  here not even letting us have this product so uh that's why brain force is so amazing
[2:35:05.400 --> 2:35:08.360]  and i can't believe there's been a screw up by whoever that we only have a little bit of it and
[2:35:08.360 --> 2:35:14.040]  that's the truth watch it'll be sold out for a while uh anthony um tell us what's in brain force and
[2:35:14.040 --> 2:35:17.240]  then get into these news articles right here about what's happening and i know you want to get into
[2:35:17.240 --> 2:35:20.600]  the news i just had to bully you into talking about it for a minute because this is actually
[2:35:21.160 --> 2:35:25.160]  i'm really excited about it because i don't think anyone has had the guts before to put
[2:35:25.160 --> 2:35:30.920]  this much power into a formula for brain health before that i found and specifically now some
[2:35:30.920 --> 2:35:34.840]  of these things that most people don't know about and they don't know about them because we have the
[2:35:34.840 --> 2:35:37.560]  research and we know it's good for brain health and they're already using it for Alzheimer's and
[2:35:37.560 --> 2:35:43.720]  stuff like that in some cases but of course it's not a hot topic i mean how could the big pharmaceutical
[2:35:43.720 --> 2:35:47.240]  companies make money off this stuff right because i mean we're selling it at an affordable price of
[2:35:47.240 --> 2:35:52.200]  30 dollars so first thing i'm going to talk about is fast fatale searing and that's uh responsible
[2:35:52.200 --> 2:35:57.400]  for a lot of things but specifically it's the cell structure of the brain and that ties into the
[2:35:57.400 --> 2:36:03.000]  fact that the tv watching that's lowering iq and making kids stupid in general isn't just because
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:07.320]  they're in a trance and they're kind of just out of it for no it admits it causes cellular death
[2:36:07.320 --> 2:36:12.600]  major study last week it changes the cellular structure of their brain right it changes the
[2:36:12.600 --> 2:36:18.680]  wiring and once it rewires the the brain is designed to necrosis in the area is not being used
[2:36:18.680 --> 2:36:22.920]  exactly and why have you never heard about this compound before fast fatale searing because it
[2:36:22.920 --> 2:36:27.160]  actually helps the cell structure of the brain that's why we put it in there and then the other
[2:36:27.160 --> 2:36:32.360]  thing i'm going to talk about is hyperzine a okay and hyperzine a oh by the back go for by the way
[2:36:32.360 --> 2:36:37.480]  let's stop nico actually wanted to come on air nico's the head producer and they're doing a great
[2:36:37.480 --> 2:36:43.160]  job nico i hadn't told anybody about this because it sounds so wild i know i was going to do it but
[2:36:43.160 --> 2:36:48.360]  why not you've noticed a difference the last three weeks i've been on this three weeks uh
[2:36:48.360 --> 2:36:52.520]  religiously and before i was just trying it out here in there because i'm not good at taking pills
[2:36:52.520 --> 2:36:57.640]  you you've noticed a difference go ahead yeah i didn't realize that you were taking any supplements
[2:36:57.640 --> 2:37:01.800]  but i've absolutely noticed that you've been way more focused the past two weeks you mean brain
[2:37:01.800 --> 2:37:05.960]  supplement you didn't know i was on brain yeah the brain supplement you've had a pep in your step and
[2:37:05.960 --> 2:37:09.160]  you've been getting here early and you've been focused on the news more than you have been in a
[2:37:09.160 --> 2:37:13.000]  long time and it's been really awesome although i mean the listeners are noticing i mean i'm still
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:18.520]  my same old stuttering crazy person but i mean it really does work nico yeah i'm gonna have to get a
[2:37:18.520 --> 2:37:23.000]  bottom one we get it back absolutely well yeah the the trucks just got here that's why we're
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:27.640]  launching it today it was coming tomorrow thank you so much nico anything else you want to add nico
[2:37:27.640 --> 2:37:31.160]  i'm good all right he was just saying that you're in the break yeah i'm sorry go through what's
[2:37:31.160 --> 2:37:35.480]  on it it's fast for tidal serine stuff right it it's works for the cell structure of the brain
[2:37:35.480 --> 2:37:39.320]  and for a long time people have been using it but guess how they had to use to get it they had to go
[2:37:39.320 --> 2:37:45.480]  into a dead cow and dissect its brain extract it from the cow's brain okay now we get it from cabbage
[2:37:45.480 --> 2:37:50.200]  so that's the extent they were going to to protect themselves and get this fast for tidal serine they
[2:37:50.200 --> 2:37:55.080]  were going to dead cows brains and extracting it that's not smart but smart because of mad cows
[2:37:55.080 --> 2:37:58.520]  they sponge your form and stuff a lot of the yep and now we get it from cabbage and then
[2:37:58.520 --> 2:38:02.280]  there's hyperzine a and this is the compound that i'm pretty sure they're going to turn into a
[2:38:02.280 --> 2:38:07.240]  pharmaceutical drug well see listen 10 years ago before i started getting burnout i would not be
[2:38:07.240 --> 2:38:13.080]  able to say the name of the mad cow prion but now that i'm on this it's definitely this i'm like
[2:38:13.720 --> 2:38:18.520]  my photographic memories coming back uh it's amazing we've all been dumbed down whether we
[2:38:18.520 --> 2:38:24.200]  know it or not uh whether we actively engage in eating bad if there's always hidden additives in
[2:38:24.200 --> 2:38:28.200]  your food even organic food has hidden additives i mean we're looking at the television screen at
[2:38:28.200 --> 2:38:31.400]  least you know for research purposes wherever we've been doing trying to learn something or
[2:38:31.400 --> 2:38:35.960]  staring at the computer all day working doing good you're still damaging your brain ultimately we've
[2:38:35.960 --> 2:38:40.440]  all been dumbed down to some degree you know and that's why it's so empowering to have all these
[2:38:40.440 --> 2:38:44.360]  things race through the other ingredients list them all all right there's hyperzine a okay and
[2:38:44.360 --> 2:38:48.360]  it's so powerful it's being heavily researched now by big pharma because they want to turn into a
[2:38:48.360 --> 2:38:53.880]  top-selling drug which i believe it will be and this increases the it's called acetylcholine
[2:38:53.880 --> 2:38:58.440]  all right and this is the chemical that all of these the puzzle of brain force ultimately does
[2:38:58.440 --> 2:39:03.000]  is it increases this acetylcholine in your brain it doesn't give you artificial amounts of it
[2:39:03.000 --> 2:39:08.040]  increases the development of it in your brain and this we always go for what makes your body
[2:39:08.040 --> 2:39:13.160]  trigger it not the fake synthetic that copies it exactly because that messes up your own receptors
[2:39:13.160 --> 2:39:17.800]  yes and this acetylcholine is the thing that connects our nerves and allows us to send signals
[2:39:17.800 --> 2:39:21.800]  so that's why people with Alzheimer's have issues with acetylcholine they're not functioning at their
[2:39:21.800 --> 2:39:26.440]  highest level because their acetylcholine levels are often decreased when you can increase that and
[2:39:26.440 --> 2:39:30.520]  shut down those yeah when you can increase it though that's when you have some award-winning
[2:39:30.520 --> 2:39:34.920]  stuff and that's why they're taking this hyperzine a and they're already starting to say we might
[2:39:34.920 --> 2:39:39.480]  have to switch this over to a pharmaceutical drug and that's our concern because the other
[2:39:39.480 --> 2:39:44.680]  pharma gets it then it's over right we have your bramante leaf powder we all you love your
[2:39:44.680 --> 2:39:49.960]  bramante that's one that's part of the very very clean path out in there the lc and i talked about
[2:39:49.960 --> 2:39:55.160]  the alpha gcp also increases the acetylcholine and then we have the vitamin b12 and here's the
[2:39:55.160 --> 2:39:59.000]  difference too we also have the super high-powered secret 12 which is obviously going to be the
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:03.960]  best source of b12 but this is the same methylcobalamin in a small dose and what that does is it ties
[2:40:03.960 --> 2:40:08.760]  the rest of it together because we've found when you have these individually like i said a little
[2:40:08.760 --> 2:40:13.560]  bit of that's why my medical doctor gave me methylcobalamin i hate needles needles are so small
[2:40:13.560 --> 2:40:18.440]  to inject when i had my physicals eight months ago and whatever i have a prescription to it and i
[2:40:18.440 --> 2:40:23.160]  take it every few days because he said you have to have all this to be able to have your hormones
[2:40:23.160 --> 2:40:28.200]  be produced and be able to absorb all these vitamins you're taking right i mean b12 is
[2:40:28.200 --> 2:40:31.960]  important for the adrenal glands it ties everything together not not to mention the cell
[2:40:31.960 --> 2:40:37.640]  formation which is the same as the hypozine a and the fast but uh fast for tidal searing so all
[2:40:37.640 --> 2:40:41.320]  these things are congruently working together and that's what is money you go to the store almost
[2:40:41.320 --> 2:40:46.440]  every b12 is not methylcobalamin because it costs 10 times more literally it's cyanocobalamin which
[2:40:46.440 --> 2:40:52.120]  is the cyanide based synthetic form and that is exactly what the chemist told us he said look
[2:40:52.120 --> 2:40:56.440]  congratulations you're the only guy that i know is using that's using methylcobalamin in a brain
[2:40:56.440 --> 2:41:01.720]  formula now we're not in fact we probably get these people on we are worshiped by the manufacturers
[2:41:01.720 --> 2:41:07.000]  because these are the top good organic folks we go to and they go thank you no one wants to put
[2:41:07.000 --> 2:41:11.560]  this out out of hundreds of people they supply i mean this one company supplies i don't want to
[2:41:11.560 --> 2:41:17.320]  say it but walmart everybody yeah and they say look cyanocobalamin is a cyanide derivative are
[2:41:17.320 --> 2:41:21.080]  you she you know they tell these people are you sure you want the cyanocobalamin it's from cyanide
[2:41:21.080 --> 2:41:25.720]  and they still say yes but then again these are the same people sweeping up herbs from the floor
[2:41:25.720 --> 2:41:30.440]  and putting the back on the conveyor belt right so we just have a higher quality standard and we're
[2:41:30.440 --> 2:41:35.560]  not ever going we're not doing this to bash our competition it's true because i'll tell you i would
[2:41:35.560 --> 2:41:40.200]  just buy from the competition if cheap was good and sell that and private label it well we tried
[2:41:40.200 --> 2:41:43.880]  that remember we looked i don't know how many people we've contacted hey we want to work with
[2:41:43.880 --> 2:41:48.360]  you blah blah and we look at their stuff and we can't actually do it because of moral reasons i mean
[2:41:48.360 --> 2:41:53.160]  we can't sell certain things because they're too low quality it's had it's come down to us making
[2:41:53.160 --> 2:41:57.960]  all of it they're pretty much every single thing and we saw one thing oxy powder that's not under
[2:41:57.960 --> 2:42:03.960]  the info wars life brand that's it and it's a phenomenal product but out for a decade info wars
[2:42:03.960 --> 2:42:08.680]  life dot com what are these headlines over here you know this is some more stuff there's just so
[2:42:08.680 --> 2:42:14.280]  much this this study called the effects of fast paced cartoons looked at people watching spongebob
[2:42:14.280 --> 2:42:18.280]  for a period of seven to nine minutes and then tested them against people that did not watch
[2:42:18.280 --> 2:42:23.080]  spongebob and the people that watch spongebob performs poorly way more poorly compared to those
[2:42:23.080 --> 2:42:30.280]  that did not well why did um why did uh the head of apple before he died they said you know what kind
[2:42:30.280 --> 2:42:34.840]  of iPad your kids have he says i don't let them have any computer Steve jobs yeah and they said
[2:42:34.840 --> 2:42:38.760]  why he goes it brain damages you exactly because what they found is that let's say like you're
[2:42:38.760 --> 2:42:43.560]  playing a guitar or flute or whatever you progress right like once you learn one song you get better
[2:42:43.560 --> 2:42:47.800]  at the next one or once you learn how to forge berries for a more primal example you
[2:42:47.800 --> 2:42:52.120]  you know get better and you forge more berries once you fight you fight better tv is a plateau
[2:42:52.120 --> 2:42:58.200]  there's no increase or decrease you don't have any actual well they they're in a race to have it
[2:42:58.200 --> 2:43:01.320]  lower and lower attention span to keep you that's why it's all frenetic
[2:43:01.320 --> 2:43:09.480]  because it's just mint to sit but that fries your brain literally especially for kids and you said
[2:43:13.080 --> 2:43:17.160]  i mean that's i mean it's like a goldfish and earlier you should read the story that
[2:43:17.160 --> 2:43:21.000]  kids now and americans in general adults have less attention span than a goldfish
[2:43:21.960 --> 2:43:26.520]  and a goldfish has the lowest attention span period yes so we literally are flipping it's
[2:43:26.520 --> 2:43:31.080]  like it's like finding Nemo with what's the name of the fish that doesn't uh i don't know i know the
[2:43:31.080 --> 2:43:38.440]  seagulls go mine mine mine that's yeah yeah oh man i'm ranting here ladies and gentlemen all right
[2:43:38.440 --> 2:43:42.760]  info warslife.com we're not kidding it's kind of bittersweet though because i'm at the cells out
[2:43:42.760 --> 2:43:47.800]  in three days with the amount you guys got i can't keep track of everything that is a real
[2:43:47.800 --> 2:43:54.200]  ball dropper it was it was not a good move for sure i mean we've been working on this for a year
[2:43:55.640 --> 2:43:59.080]  more a little more than that i mean it is a sales gimmick to say something's gonna sell out but
[2:43:59.080 --> 2:44:02.920]  you notice four products are sold out well you know that's the other thing too you do say the
[2:44:02.920 --> 2:44:06.360]  products can sell out when they do sell out liver shield is sold out it's completely sold out it
[2:44:06.360 --> 2:44:10.120]  might not even be here for one to two months we've been sold out of prostagard we've been sold out of
[2:44:10.120 --> 2:44:15.080]  con uh e childies we're sold out of all of those it's not a gimmick it is sold out it's been sold
[2:44:15.080 --> 2:44:18.520]  out for like months people say why don't you just get more because we don't have the money to buy
[2:44:18.520 --> 2:44:21.880]  a big enough stockpile to have it sit there because we don't buy products for 10 cents a bottle where
[2:44:21.880 --> 2:44:26.360]  they just import crap from china we have high quality it's hard for them to line up getting it all
[2:44:26.360 --> 2:44:31.160]  then it all has to be triple tested by the lab then we test again even though that's not the law
[2:44:31.160 --> 2:44:34.440]  because we know we have enemies and stuff that are tracking everything so we keep bottles at the
[2:44:34.440 --> 2:44:38.840]  factory and here in case someone ever spikes it to set us up yeah as we've been threatened to do
[2:44:38.840 --> 2:44:43.080]  don't think we're not aware of that i mean we're neurotic praise god we've got a lot of angles
[2:44:43.080 --> 2:44:47.720]  covered here we're just winners and our enemies don't like it i mean they hate the fact we're
[2:44:47.720 --> 2:44:53.480]  funding info wars by not taking your tax money like ms nbc or cnb i mean they literally get
[2:44:53.480 --> 2:44:58.440]  taxpayer money we don't support our local amnf affiliates that is just as important as buying

[2:45:54.360 --> 2:45:57.320]  news anything else you want to add about this i mean you just got into one of your articles about
[2:45:57.320 --> 2:46:01.480]  them there's a lot but i think we're ready to move forward on it i mean well you're gonna get into
[2:46:02.120 --> 2:46:05.480]  everybody's on these drugs and knock their brain out because the brain's so fried
[2:46:05.480 --> 2:46:10.520]  only makes it worse look at xanax so you know xanax and ambien how many people do you know
[2:46:10.520 --> 2:46:15.080]  they're on xanax or ambien a lot i personally know multiple people right most of women you're
[2:46:15.080 --> 2:46:19.640]  running to are unfortunately what people think and their doctors tell them is that well you just
[2:46:19.640 --> 2:46:23.160]  take xanax every now and then and you'll feel a little better but then every now and then every
[2:46:23.160 --> 2:46:27.400]  once a month turns into five times a month ten times a month every single day and then that
[2:46:27.400 --> 2:46:30.520]  doesn't work so they start giving you two or three more drugs what happens is of course people
[2:46:30.520 --> 2:46:34.120]  aren't addressing the root issues in their lives and they're upset about it and they have no passion
[2:46:34.120 --> 2:46:37.080]  and they have no will to live and some of them are suicidal because they have no purpose they
[2:46:37.080 --> 2:46:41.720]  don't live a purpose driven life and what happens is they take ambien or they take xanax every day
[2:46:41.720 --> 2:46:46.360]  and their memory is going to be destroyed you're gonna have memory loss and you're gonna have to
[2:46:46.360 --> 2:46:52.840]  mention this is from AARP of all places from 2012 so we've known this more than more than a decade
[2:46:52.840 --> 2:46:58.440]  and it gives you cancer i mean it's all come out of course right and it people get dependent on
[2:46:58.440 --> 2:47:03.640]  them on them just like painkillers and they get they get their brain structure is ruined because
[2:47:03.640 --> 2:47:08.760]  they can't face the issue they have unfortunately it's very sad so they dumb themselves down
[2:47:08.760 --> 2:47:13.160]  and then when they dumb themselves down they get used to a limited state of brain functioning
[2:47:13.160 --> 2:47:16.520]  and in this limited state of brain functioning they don't have to face their issues maybe as much
[2:47:16.520 --> 2:47:20.680]  and they could sleep or whatever it is but that limited state stays permanent and their memory
[2:47:20.680 --> 2:47:25.240]  is destroyed and they're not able to function as human beings especially a lobotomy it is a lobotomy
[2:47:25.240 --> 2:47:29.400]  and of course the doctors don't tell them hey well what if you do this or what if you actually
[2:47:29.400 --> 2:47:35.800]  give value go climb a hill uh go do charity uh i mean all of this shows that because you're meant
[2:47:35.800 --> 2:47:40.760]  to have a purpose your brain you don't have a purpose but but nihilistic pleasure which is fun
[2:47:40.760 --> 2:47:46.520]  for a while i mean believe me i'm not a saint in my life uh it is not fulfilling no i mean i was in
[2:47:46.520 --> 2:47:50.200]  college had all these really hot girlfriends rest of it it was not fulfilling god was fulfilling
[2:47:50.200 --> 2:47:54.600]  having children was fulfilling helping people was fulfilling and it's because we're purpose driven
[2:47:54.600 --> 2:47:58.280]  if you aren't don't have a purpose you're not helping people your body starts shutting off
[2:47:58.280 --> 2:48:03.080]  because you're not needed i mean it's that simple they've cut open the brains of like
[2:48:03.080 --> 2:48:07.880]  90-year-old famous composers they're shriveled or tiny but the people were geniuses when they died
[2:48:08.520 --> 2:48:13.080]  because what was there in brain mass was all wired properly and they were purpose driven
[2:48:13.080 --> 2:48:17.000]  you i mean it's just like the physical exercise if you know an exercise you're gonna
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:21.560]  weigh 400 pounds you're gonna die of a heart attack when you're 45 if you're purpose driven
[2:48:21.560 --> 2:48:27.160]  and exercising you're gonna be dynamic and live to 85 and if you watch tv your mind is gonna have
[2:48:27.160 --> 2:48:31.240]  literal gray matter everywhere and you're not gonna develop any systems to actually do anything
[2:48:31.240 --> 2:48:35.080]  and that's the other thing too like you just said is people go to the doctor and they don't ever
[2:48:35.080 --> 2:48:39.160]  tell them to actually give value all these people want to take value they want to watch tv and
[2:48:39.160 --> 2:48:43.320]  absorb they want to absorb the media they want to take and not give exactly they don't want to give
[2:48:43.320 --> 2:48:48.040]  anything but the but giving is what makes you strong the only way they'll feel better i mean i
[2:48:48.040 --> 2:48:53.320]  went in and bench pressed i'm finally getting strong again you know 245 pounds uh i was getting
[2:48:53.320 --> 2:48:57.800]  10 reps of it a saturday went worked out when i was up in uh kalamazoo at the gym there in the
[2:48:57.800 --> 2:49:02.840]  radisson really nice radisson nice radisson i ever saw but that's a side issue and and it's
[2:49:02.840 --> 2:49:07.320]  like this attitude of oh that's heavy i do work and it was fun to do it and it gave me something
[2:49:07.320 --> 2:49:13.080]  to lift that weight what is exercise it's pushing out isn't it i mean it's exerting force people
[2:49:13.080 --> 2:49:17.080]  that don't exercise don't do anything don't give anything to life or society or the planet what
[2:49:17.080 --> 2:49:20.920]  are the globalists in that pentagon reported mitt on mastering the human domain they say
[2:49:20.920 --> 2:49:26.040]  we're worried about empowered individuals not about terrorists not about empowered individuals
[2:49:26.040 --> 2:49:32.360]  that's what threatens them anthony oh i bet i mean just look at the new media which is social media
[2:49:32.360 --> 2:49:35.960]  on there you have millions of followers who spread everything you say and they're super
[2:49:35.960 --> 2:49:39.880]  super powered up and they get value from that because they know they're helping people they're
[2:49:39.880 --> 2:49:43.000]  going to spread this video and they're going to help people and they're going to have value in
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:47.000]  their life our enemy is in there always saying you're failing you're nothing nobody listens to
[2:49:47.000 --> 2:49:51.720]  you wanting to disempower they're desperate of course they're like shut them down shut them
[2:49:51.720 --> 2:49:58.200]  down demonize them what are you doing but all the elite have are just masses of drones they have
[2:49:58.200 --> 2:50:04.600]  nothing but suppressive technology and suppressive acts nothing they do gives any value they're
[2:50:04.600 --> 2:50:08.840]  afraid of value and they're afraid of people sharing these videos and sharing the articles and
[2:50:08.840 --> 2:50:13.000]  the forwards and everything like that because that puts things out and gives value the people that
[2:50:13.000 --> 2:50:17.480]  detract and attack all they do is try to steal value like value vampires that's how the universe
[2:50:17.480 --> 2:50:22.280]  all these losers that will help that then backstab us they don't understand i always did it because
[2:50:22.280 --> 2:50:26.600]  the right thing to do but now understands the secret of the universe you give out good it comes back
[2:50:26.600 --> 2:50:31.240]  to you right but it's not some magic thing like name it and claim it pray and you'll get it no
[2:50:31.240 --> 2:50:35.880]  go out be a good person take action for the right reason and then the universe opens up
[2:50:35.880 --> 2:50:39.640]  their value vampires because it's the same people that go on on implores all day and
[2:50:39.640 --> 2:50:43.320]  comment and troll and everybody they're just stealing value they're not putting anything out
[2:50:43.320 --> 2:50:48.040]  who cares about them right the people that matter are the things yeah then they never criticized us
[2:50:48.040 --> 2:50:52.600]  effectively saying here's a better way to do it or here's my idea it's just attack the crab trying
[2:50:52.600 --> 2:50:56.280]  to get out of the bucket we'll be back ladies and gentlemen i gotta get into these cops i'm gonna do

[2:54:14.280 --> 2:54:22.760]  people can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which by any decent standard they ought not to
[2:54:22.760 --> 2:54:30.920]  enjoy i hope she would better stop from the beginning i hope she would better start from the
[2:54:30.920 --> 2:54:42.360]  beginning i hope she would better start from the beginning too many kids are what's making
[2:54:42.360 --> 2:54:47.400]  planet worse a lot of these kids come from bad gene pools they don't have stable parents making
[2:54:47.400 --> 2:54:54.760]  good decisions work to recontaining vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new
[2:54:54.760 --> 2:54:59.240]  studies in the journal pediatric these new studies suggest that the opposite that the
[2:54:59.240 --> 2:55:04.040]  preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance fluoride
[2:55:04.040 --> 2:55:09.960]  in water is supposed to fight tooth decay but could it also cause cancer oh yeah the government
[2:55:09.960 --> 2:55:15.160]  had the right under us law to conduct secret testing on the american public under specific
[2:55:15.160 --> 2:55:20.920]  conditions we have to work with dark side while we all spend time in the shadows any attempt to
[2:55:20.920 --> 2:55:26.600]  achieve world order must be the work of the devil will join me and i'm proud to sit here at the
[2:55:26.600 --> 2:55:37.000]  right hand to see there's a need for new world order someday in the next few years a solution
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:47.480]  really and that solution has already been the planetary cashless society backing everything
[2:55:47.480 --> 2:55:55.400]  you do an in game against humanity i'll do overdrive to finish up getting the news i haven't
[2:55:55.400 --> 2:55:59.800]  covered yet but i have already mentioned it they're funding ISIS they're running it they don't
[2:55:59.800 --> 2:56:03.880]  command them but they're funding them and turning them loose and letting them recruit all over the
[2:56:03.880 --> 2:56:09.160]  western world it's just outrageous criminal activity and when they attack they'll take more
[2:56:09.160 --> 2:56:14.520]  of our rights and when i fly the tsa will want to grow up my genitals and put me through a naked
[2:56:14.520 --> 2:56:19.720]  body scanner i'm not even blaming the tsa people themselves they're victims as well they're in
[2:56:19.720 --> 2:56:23.880]  their baking inside the radiation rooms and they lie to them and tell them it's fine for them they
[2:56:23.880 --> 2:56:31.080]  have cancer clusters and we all have to have our genitals grow up or whatever and take our shoes
[2:56:31.080 --> 2:56:35.560]  off and put our hands up like we're prisoners while the government funds al-qaeda publicly
[2:56:35.560 --> 2:56:40.600]  and then they can have the former cia deputy director on cbs saying he you know wouldn't
[2:56:40.600 --> 2:56:48.120]  be surprised by an attack here's that clip routinely um but there's nothing routine about
[2:56:48.120 --> 2:56:53.720]  this particular one to me this one really resonates with me for two reasons one is there's been about
[2:56:53.720 --> 2:56:59.480]  50 people in the last 12 months who've been arrested in the united states um for being radicalized
[2:56:59.480 --> 2:57:03.880]  by isis wanting to go fight there or wanting to conduct an attack here and they're not wound up
[2:57:03.880 --> 2:57:10.120]  a lot there who are seeing themselves as aligned with isis number one and then number two you have
[2:57:10.120 --> 2:57:15.160]  this isis call to arms during ramadan we are right in the middle of ramadan oh yeah they're
[2:57:15.160 --> 2:57:19.960]  called arms conduct attacks against our enemies so i'm worried about this one what does this mean
[2:57:19.960 --> 2:57:25.320]  for americans on port of july um i don't want to tell americans what to do or what not to do um
[2:57:25.320 --> 2:57:31.080]  but nor i wouldn't be surprised if we're sitting here a week from today talking about an attack
[2:57:31.080 --> 2:57:35.240]  over the weekend of the united states that's how serious this is and see they don't have to stage
[2:57:35.240 --> 2:57:40.600]  at this time because this isn't synthetic with the former you know with the grandson of the
[2:57:40.600 --> 2:57:46.200]  former head of the adl commanding al-qaeda adam gadan i mean how dumb they think we are they've
[2:57:46.200 --> 2:57:51.640]  actually created 200 man plus army 200 000 plus man army they've allowed them to get oil fills you
[2:57:51.640 --> 2:57:55.800]  name it they've left them alone they're allowed to fly back and forth they've allowed them to come in
[2:57:56.680 --> 2:58:00.760]  they bet you're so stupid and the media is so controlled that when they attack
[2:58:02.200 --> 2:58:07.160]  no one will say why'd you create them why'd you bring them in and that's why they hate us because
[2:58:07.160 --> 2:58:11.160]  we're going to be here pointing out and you can try to kill me or shut me up the words are already
[2:58:11.160 --> 2:58:16.600]  out so don't allow your people to attack here's the problem they don't completely control these yahoos
[2:58:16.600 --> 2:58:21.640]  these isis groups are not the standard mentally ill person that the government winds up
[2:58:22.360 --> 2:58:26.680]  to go out and do something so the fbi gets a caller and gets to be on the news
[2:58:28.680 --> 2:58:33.800]  this is real and i've been telling you that for about a year and now you see it i'm not saying
[2:58:33.800 --> 2:58:39.000]  they'll be in attack for that you lie but they're building up towards it to take our liberties and
[2:58:39.000 --> 2:58:43.320]  freedoms i'm gonna do some overdrive and get into the police and how they're trying to hire
[2:58:43.320 --> 2:58:46.280]  mental patients uh to fill their ranks stay with us
