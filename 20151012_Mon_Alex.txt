[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.680]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.680 --> 00:29.320]  more and more political analysts commentators comedians you name it are coming out from the
[00:29.320 --> 00:35.240]  left and the right and saying that political correctness is a form of mind control a form
[00:35.240 --> 00:41.280]  of social engineering a form of mass conditioning to destroy the language destroy debate and
[00:41.280 --> 00:45.720]  kill the Renaissance now I know his listeners of this broadcast probably before he ever
[00:45.720 --> 00:54.800]  found the transmission you knew that but we have to raise the rhetoric to the level of
[00:54.800 --> 01:01.280]  the actual attack and yes it's fantastical that we have psychiatrist psychologist run
[01:01.280 --> 01:06.880]  Pentagon programs of mind control being deployed against the American people but it's in the
[01:06.880 --> 01:14.080]  Washington Post it's in the New York Times with a straight flat face they say yes the
[01:14.080 --> 01:18.720]  CIA and Pentagon are involved conditioning the public and preparing you to accept the
[01:18.720 --> 01:26.400]  new system and yes national sovereignty does not exist the family does not exist mother
[01:26.400 --> 01:32.720]  and father does not exist private property does not exist the Amish do not exist you
[01:32.720 --> 01:40.600]  will be assimilated we are the board submit army destroyed it's so over the top that
[01:40.600 --> 01:46.560]  only a complete flipping against it has any chance and I was driving into work this morning
[01:46.560 --> 01:52.520]  I was thinking how do we get people to break their conditioning and it's just that people
[01:52.520 --> 01:58.880]  have to realize that you can't be reasonable you can't compromise with the globalist or
[01:58.880 --> 02:07.240]  the so-called political left they are not the left they are hardcore brazen scientifically
[02:07.240 --> 02:13.680]  focused groups conquering us when you get to even mid-level managers of the left they
[02:13.680 --> 02:18.320]  will laugh if you're sitting around a cocktail you know table with them and say of course
[02:18.320 --> 02:24.760]  we're taking over of course we're conditioning people tell us something we don't know I hate
[02:24.760 --> 02:32.680]  minorities I mean it's just oh you ought to join us you fool that's who they are of course
[02:32.680 --> 02:40.240]  we're aborting the blacks and then the left the general public is sits there like mindless
[02:40.240 --> 02:45.840]  victims like children climbing into a beat-up white creeper van because they heard ice cream
[02:45.840 --> 02:51.280]  truck music coming out of it but there's a demonic wildcat inside that vehicle to tear
[02:51.280 --> 03:00.560]  you apart they are enemies they are consciously evil and if you don't get that through your
[03:00.560 --> 03:05.720]  head and realize their psychotic predators and sociopaths and mercenaries under them
[03:05.720 --> 03:11.600]  you have no hope you have to break with these people you have to understand their evil you
[03:11.600 --> 03:17.320]  have to understand their enemy of you and your family and everything else is just window
[03:17.320 --> 03:23.900]  dressing and the world is understanding that very evil people captured America we had good
[03:23.900 --> 03:30.080]  will the planet we were some of the most moral aggressive free market people we weren't perfect
[03:30.080 --> 03:36.960]  but we were heads above everybody else we were exceptional and as great things tend to flip
[03:36.960 --> 03:43.080]  we flipped from the greatest and the best to the most evil and now we can flip again
[03:43.080 --> 03:47.880]  right back to where we were that's how history tends to work it doesn't tend to go and slow
[03:47.880 --> 03:54.280]  moving flag sure there's long periods of that but then there's periods where it just flips
[03:54.280 --> 03:59.560]  and the globalists are there right now trying to keep it going their direction they want
[03:59.560 --> 04:05.800]  to flip their current tyranny into an anti-human transhumanist deindustrialization skirmish
[04:05.800 --> 04:12.360]  wars economic war culture war that's why they flood everything I was sent a link by Buckley
[04:12.360 --> 04:17.760]  this weekend and by a bunch of other people in fact you guys printed for me it was in
[04:17.760 --> 04:23.120]  the Houston Chronicle and I saw the headline and I said is this a joke I went to the URL
[04:23.120 --> 04:28.080]  it wasn't the onion spoofing the Houston Chronicle and then it was in the Austin America statesman
[04:28.080 --> 04:32.920]  that the left is going to it was the headline in the statesman I couldn't believe students
[04:32.920 --> 04:41.000]  to wear giant dildos uh in cocks for glocks this is in the paper but everybody read front
[04:41.000 --> 04:46.400]  page of the paper the statesman also in the Houston Chronicles where I first saw it and
[04:46.400 --> 04:49.360]  he said well it's just silly it's stupid that's how they're going to protest people with guns
[04:49.360 --> 04:55.880]  on campus but no it's pure genius it's just mindless stupidness to just confuse everything
[04:55.880 --> 05:02.480]  it's cia warfare kit daniels info wars dot com did you know that guns are less deadly
[05:02.480 --> 05:07.560]  than alcohol at least 88,000 deaths per year are attributed to alcohol abuse and 30 people
[05:07.560 --> 05:12.320]  per day die in alcohol related auto accidents in the u.s. alone heavy drinkers are also
[05:12.320 --> 05:17.600]  more prone to violence suicide and risky sexual behavior in comparison there were 36,000 gun
[05:17.600 --> 05:22.920]  related deaths including suicides and accidents in the u.s. in 2013 and as percentage of all
[05:22.920 --> 05:27.720]  causes of death alcohol related deaths are over twice as common as deaths involving firearms
[05:27.720 --> 05:32.280]  even more interesting one-third of gun deaths are alcohol related so according to gun control
[05:32.280 --> 05:36.360]  logic we could eliminate one-third of gun related deaths overnight by banning alcohol
[05:36.360 --> 05:40.280]  yet you'll notice that mom's man action and other Bloomberg back groups aren't demanding
[05:40.280 --> 05:44.600]  we ban booze and beer that's because the true agenda behind gun control is to control the
[05:44.600 --> 05:48.440]  population because the government can only expand at the expense of individual rights
[05:48.440 --> 05:52.040]  such as the second amendment ryan mc macken of the mesis institute wrote an excellent

[07:09.160 --> 07:14.520]  nason iodine x2 it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years
[07:14.520 --> 07:19.880]  the federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine a crude form of it be added
[07:19.880 --> 07:24.520]  to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency and iodine

[07:53.480 --> 08:14.760]  life dot com or by calling 888-253-3139 the alex jones show because there is a war
[08:14.760 --> 08:28.600]  for your mind everything the social engineers do is about being silly and goofy and funny and the
[08:28.600 --> 08:34.280]  little trendies have their bouffant hair their little beards their little colorful shirts and
[08:34.280 --> 08:43.720]  they just say do what we want speak like we want you to be friendly be nice don't hurt us feel guilty
[08:43.720 --> 08:53.960]  do what we say and that's simply camouflage on the special forces operators of the big foundations
[08:53.960 --> 08:59.880]  who are here to take down society and they've got armies of phd is competing
[09:01.480 --> 09:07.320]  to be the most savage the most focused the most manipulative to get the positions of power in the
[09:07.320 --> 09:11.560]  national governments in the local governments in the state governments the county governments the
[09:11.560 --> 09:17.640]  city governments and the sub districts but above that they all wish to graduate to the
[09:17.640 --> 09:24.760]  world government level where you are tax exempt and have diplomatic community and fly on above the
[09:24.760 --> 09:33.640]  law corporate jets with no searches no seizure above the law you and diplomats lead slaves around in
[09:33.640 --> 09:42.040]  new york on chains the police can't even go to their houses that's who we're dealing with the new
[09:42.040 --> 09:55.240]  royalty and they sit there and tell us about class envy and class warfare and try to sick the giant
[09:55.240 --> 10:03.880]  unwashed masses that they've helped create on civilization and have a war against industry
[10:03.880 --> 10:11.000]  and a war against power a war against energy a war against prosperity a war against invention
[10:11.000 --> 10:21.400]  and ingenuity and innovation and exploration there are two competing forces in the world
[10:21.400 --> 10:30.760]  those that wish to create incredible civilization and those who wish to create a new dark age
[10:33.000 --> 10:40.920]  and that's what we face that's what the world comes down to right now if we innovate if humans
[10:40.920 --> 10:46.120]  go to the next level the globalists won't be able to control the future and play god and they are
[10:46.120 --> 10:55.800]  completely standing against humanity right now and the question is which side are we going to
[10:55.800 --> 11:02.920]  eternally decide to be on that's what the planetary government is about is the elite playing god and
[11:02.920 --> 11:09.640]  taking control of human evolution human development in their words and they've done it to a great
[11:09.640 --> 11:19.160]  extent and we've seen the fruits of their engineering and it is the most selfish twisted
[11:20.600 --> 11:32.280]  hateful paradigm and wavelengths that we could possibly imagine because when you sink to evil
[11:32.280 --> 11:36.280]  when you give yourself over to not caring about others and cutting yourself off from the world
[11:36.280 --> 11:44.680]  the universe you sink to the absolute center of the worst spirit the universe has ever produced
[11:47.400 --> 11:54.120]  this spirit doesn't just seek to destroy humanity it seeks to first render us down twist us take
[11:54.120 --> 12:02.600]  our hope and have a mass ritual of slow torture of the life force of this planet
[12:02.600 --> 12:12.280]  now do you kneel to that in fear believing and we'll give you power for a day do you submit to
[12:12.280 --> 12:22.840]  that force there is no submission to that force in logic and that's why it wages war against the
[12:22.840 --> 12:30.120]  psyche why it wages war against common sense why it wages war against prosperity independence
[12:30.120 --> 12:37.160]  and free will because all of those things are set diametrically opposed to that spirit
[12:41.160 --> 12:45.720]  now i'm done preaching i'm gonna stop for the day jesse ventura we had a heated debate last time
[12:45.720 --> 12:50.440]  you notice these these have not been the friendliest of interviews because he's kind of gone more left
[12:50.440 --> 12:55.960]  within that left-right paradigm he says he's transcended it but he's in the political atmosphere
[12:55.960 --> 12:59.640]  i think gone more left i'm gonna ask you about that today but i want to do a friendly interview
[12:59.640 --> 13:05.000]  he's reissued his book updated it american conspiracies we'll be talking about some of those issues
[13:06.600 --> 13:14.920]  and the election and more today with jesse ventura in the third hour but before we do that we're
[13:14.920 --> 13:20.600]  obviously going to open the phones up and cover a ton of news and information today so let me
[13:20.600 --> 13:32.360]  be just mention a smattering of some of the news that is going to be coming up today obviously
[13:38.040 --> 13:41.720]  we're going to look at some of the democratic debates coming up the fact that they think the
[13:41.720 --> 13:47.080]  ratings are going to be super low they're begging biden to get involved in all of that
[13:47.080 --> 13:54.440]  uh we're also going to be looking at info wars dot com and some of the top news that's there
[13:56.040 --> 14:01.160]  we have obama saying yes if i ran for president again i would win i'd love to do some more
[14:06.200 --> 14:10.040]  we've got a lot of political correctness news we're going to be breaking down
[14:10.040 --> 14:17.480]  down we have the uk ministry of defense denying tabloid reports that raf ready to shoot down
[14:17.480 --> 14:23.160]  russian planes in iraq and how that ties into other u.s government announcements on the situation
[14:24.920 --> 14:34.360]  we have a very important breakdown with merkel defending the refugee policy as an expression
[14:34.360 --> 14:43.240]  of humanity we have a lot of science health and tech news and of course economy news
[14:43.240 --> 14:48.600]  that we're going to be getting to today and i think the first thing i want to get into now
[14:48.600 --> 14:57.800]  is political correctness because i don't think the public is aware of the progenitor of this
[14:57.800 --> 15:07.400]  social engineers in england the united states france and germany who produced the communist
[15:07.400 --> 15:12.760]  ideology that was funded by the robber barons of europe and the united states in england
[15:14.040 --> 15:20.120]  that financed the bolstered revolution in 1917 the word political the term political correctness
[15:20.120 --> 15:30.600]  is from the soviet union during the linen and then the stalin era it finally began to stall out
[15:30.600 --> 15:38.840]  by the 1960s but continued on to a certain extent that this is western social engineering tested
[15:38.840 --> 15:47.480]  on the poor russians i always love how there's this cultural meme to hate the russians and there
[15:47.480 --> 15:52.840]  are enemy and all the rest of it when culturally scientifically they're like our brothers in the
[15:52.840 --> 16:00.360]  west it's where the west really meets the east and when our government and the british government
[16:00.360 --> 16:07.320]  committed the incredible crime of putting the bolsheviks in in 1917 and the reign of red terror
[16:07.320 --> 16:11.720]  that killed 50 million russians and other eastern europeans
[16:11.720 --> 16:18.120]  50 million people conservatively killed by linen install
[16:20.600 --> 16:26.600]  and the people that run our government today are the grandchildren and the children of the
[16:26.600 --> 16:32.840]  engineers that did that so make no mistake they want to do that here and a lot of people hear this
[16:32.840 --> 16:37.160]  show and they go look up the weathermen and they go look up ford's foundation and they go
[16:37.160 --> 16:42.280]  look up the statements of the army dot mill about reeducation camps they call it reeducation camps
[16:42.280 --> 16:47.400]  they use the soviet term because that's what it is and people find it out and they get really scared
[16:47.400 --> 16:51.720]  they send me letters or see them on the street and they say my god i checked out the fema camps
[16:51.720 --> 16:59.480]  it's all real what do we do it's so scary i can't i can't tune in anymore well the the camps and the
[16:59.480 --> 17:05.800]  preparations are there whether you want to believe it or not and only admitting all of this is going
[17:05.800 --> 17:14.120]  to stop it but what they did in the cultural revolution funded by the rockefellers on record
[17:14.120 --> 17:24.840]  in china in the 50s and 60s starting in 1949 and what they did starting in 1917 running up until
[17:24.840 --> 17:34.040]  about 1963 what they did is what they plan to do here they don't like you with your nice houses
[17:34.040 --> 17:39.400]  and swimming pools they don't like farmers with big pieces of property they don't like the amish
[17:39.400 --> 17:45.240]  they don't like anybody they don't control they want to take you and your families
[17:45.240 --> 17:49.800]  and put you in big compact cities and high rises and order you around and tell you what
[17:49.800 --> 17:53.160]  job you're going to have and tell you what you're going to be and tell you how much food you're
[17:53.160 --> 17:58.840]  going to get and sit there and watch everyone step and fetch as slaves to what they're bringing
[17:58.840 --> 18:05.880]  into this country under agenda 21 and so i'm not here to scare you this is already happening
[18:07.720 --> 18:13.160]  it's like the doctor telling you you got skin cancer we got a 95 chance to remove it get not
[18:13.160 --> 18:18.120]  coming back what you got to act now it's starting to metastasize and if it gets into other parts
[18:18.120 --> 18:25.000]  of your body you're going to die that's good news when you know it you can identify it you can deal
[18:25.000 --> 18:32.280]  with it but i'm here to tell you you can't screw around with this you cannot screw around with
[18:32.280 --> 18:40.600]  hardcore pure tyranny that has a lust a bloodthirst a will to dominate you and your family
[18:42.840 --> 18:48.680]  to tell you how to speak what to say what to do what to wear where to live and it's all done
[18:48.680 --> 18:55.160]  through touchy feely we love you we're going to protect you we care about you do what we say and
[18:55.160 --> 18:59.480]  everything's going to be all right but if you get out of line we've got swat teams and black
[18:59.480 --> 19:04.520]  uniforms and tanks down the street and helicopters would train killers to come after you
[19:06.680 --> 19:11.800]  so you can either do what we say and go under stock home syndrome and decide you love your
[19:11.800 --> 19:19.480]  captivity out of your fear or we're going to hurt you well here's the secret they're already
[19:19.480 --> 19:26.360]  hurting you with the fluoride and the gmo and the aspartame and the msg and the barium salts and
[19:26.360 --> 19:33.960]  the aluminum dioxide and the vaccines so you're already under attack you might as well admit it
[19:34.600 --> 19:40.120]  gut up decide to learn the facts decide to get aggressive to start voting with your dollars
[19:40.120 --> 19:45.960]  and your actions and start spreading the word and offensively waking people up while digging in
[19:45.960 --> 19:51.320]  and creating a culture of survival because that's what we face and we're going to make it through
[19:51.320 --> 19:55.720]  all this the ultimate destiny of humanity we're going to break down political correctness straight
[19:55.720 --> 20:04.840]  ahead my name is bill bonner and i'm the president of the largest private news and research network

[20:17.560 --> 20:23.560]  implications for life in america from where you shop to the doctors you visit and the family you

[29:53.960 --> 30:02.920]  radio network hit daniel's info wars dot com the college newspaper claimed that concealed
[30:02.920 --> 30:07.800]  carry is an example of white privilege you heard that right an article in a daily text in the
[30:07.800 --> 30:13.000]  campus newspaper of the university of texas at austin said quote based on the historical president
[30:13.000 --> 30:18.040]  of black people framed as dangerous the new gun policy which legalizes concealed carry on campus
[30:18.040 --> 30:22.600]  will endanger black students who choose to exercise their new rights but here's the ironic part the
[30:22.600 --> 30:27.400]  same article also pointed out the historical link between gun control and jim crow laws before the
[30:27.400 --> 30:31.960]  civil war southerners passed laws to keep guns away from slaves and freed black slaves to stifle
[30:31.960 --> 30:36.280]  potential revolt the article stated after the civil war and during the rise of the coup clux
[30:36.280 --> 30:41.160]  clan southern laws were passed to disarm the black man the article also referred to how california
[30:41.160 --> 30:45.720]  lawmakers passed an open carry ban in response to the black panthers this article is a microcosm
[30:45.720 --> 30:50.120]  of leftist logic banned the guns because of so-called white privilege even though gun control grew

[33:18.120 --> 33:25.560]  coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[33:26.280 --> 33:30.600]  i was just thinking during the break i've got paul watson here from london he's here for two weeks
[33:31.720 --> 33:36.440]  he's gonna be hosting the show one day this week why not have him in to talk about this because
[33:36.440 --> 33:44.680]  he's brought it up they have a natural english flag is white with a red cross uh i guess the
[33:44.680 --> 33:51.080]  british flag would be the union jack or the flag of the empire but it's being banned and if you
[33:51.080 --> 33:56.520]  fly it on your house he's told me about it people will come to your house not even the quote immigrants
[33:56.520 --> 34:02.760]  but the political correct and say you need to take that down so the e you can pull this up four
[34:02.760 --> 34:11.480]  years ago push to take away tax exemptives if the big european football league didn't get rid of
[34:11.480 --> 34:18.120]  spanish portuguese swiss dutch german greek football names national teams they want them to
[34:18.120 --> 34:24.920]  just be the tyrannosaurus or the goblins because they said it's nationalistic and that's not good
[34:24.920 --> 34:29.400]  see the political correctness here starts with well let's get rid of the redskins that's not
[34:29.400 --> 34:34.120]  dishonoring that of america saying they're strong and they're warriors um you know it's like saying
[34:34.120 --> 34:42.360]  black white you can say redskin is a insult maybe it is with somebody maybe you can argue maybe we
[34:42.360 --> 34:47.000]  should get rid of it but see they're not just doing that to be reasonable next it's don't say
[34:47.000 --> 34:52.600]  father or mother don't say boy or girl don't say he or she it's about setting the precedent they
[34:52.600 --> 34:57.160]  control the language so i remember like six years ago started out in san francisco and then in texas
[34:57.160 --> 35:04.840]  and other areas that kids wearing american flag shirts was hurtful to the illegal aliens because
[35:04.840 --> 35:12.760]  they've been told that was a hurtful flag and so now they're moving to remove the american flag
[35:12.760 --> 35:17.960]  more and more saying it's hurtful and you'll say oh that will never happen no they're teaching
[35:17.960 --> 35:23.240]  children in thousands of school districts and look it up national review other publications
[35:23.240 --> 35:29.880]  that in an official common core that you don't say boy or girl that's you're a purple penguin
[35:29.880 --> 35:34.920]  and they say why well there's some people that aren't boys and girls to confuse and jack with your
[35:34.920 --> 35:42.840]  kids to sexualize them to to be able to get in there and mess with their identity well that's
[35:42.840 --> 35:49.960]  that's god level parents shouldn't even do that notice it started out with dr spock and the rest
[35:49.960 --> 35:55.000]  of it the child psychologists don't tell your kids what they should be don't discipline them let
[35:55.000 --> 36:00.200]  them be as bad as they want so they wouldn't have any identity from you and the culture that was
[36:00.200 --> 36:07.560]  handed down from the ancients father to son mother to daughter they broke that so they could then come
[36:07.560 --> 36:14.920]  in with a blank slate of confused people and say we'll give you direction just like young
[36:14.920 --> 36:19.080]  people in the inner city who had their fathers taken away by social engineering can't have a
[36:19.080 --> 36:24.200]  man in the house within one generation you go from 15 20 percent illegitimacy in the black community
[36:24.200 --> 36:30.520]  to 85 90 percent and now who's the daddy the guy with the tattoos the guy that gives you a gun the
[36:30.520 --> 36:36.680]  guy that gives you the crack cocaine the guy that gives you the the pot to sell and he'll
[36:36.680 --> 36:41.480]  discipline you he'll attack you he'll beat you he'll kill you if you don't follow his orders
[36:41.480 --> 36:50.680]  that's your daddy now who's going to induct you into prison and that's the art of organized crime
[36:50.680 --> 36:56.040]  get a certain number of young people pick the ones you want burn certain ones for the police
[36:56.040 --> 37:01.720]  take the others put them into the combine give them jobs managing the whole criminal syndicate
[37:01.720 --> 37:05.000]  that sits right below the surface of every town in every city
[37:05.000 --> 37:12.360]  that's been taken over some areas have not been taken over and you just drive into that
[37:12.360 --> 37:17.080]  town you feel good you feel happy the good people are congregated there you drive another
[37:17.080 --> 37:22.760]  town you feel the spirit drive another town it feels kind of okay another town feels good
[37:22.760 --> 37:27.960]  because you're picking up on it your body has a sixth sense of where you should be who you should
[37:27.960 --> 37:38.200]  be amongst so cops wearing union jack badge in tribute to dead police officer ordered to remove

[37:55.000 --> 38:01.000]  line badges after pc david phillips was killed on duty because they might cause offense police
[38:01.000 --> 38:06.040]  officers wearing union jack badges in tribute to david phillips who was killed on duty were
[38:06.040 --> 38:09.880]  allegedly ordered to remove them because they might cause offense rector paul into police
[38:09.880 --> 38:14.280]  officer reportedly told not to wear the thin blue line badges union jack flag with the thin blue
[38:14.280 --> 38:19.080]  line in it because it could cause offense to some with certain communities so where's your speech
[38:19.080 --> 38:24.120]  because something might hurt someone's feelings that's why in germany now they're saying don't wear
[38:25.080 --> 38:30.760]  short dresses october fest in some towns they're saying yeah we may not want to have street parties
[38:30.760 --> 38:35.560]  like we've always done for a thousand years because it's going to make the muslims mad
[38:36.520 --> 38:43.080]  so they take western hospitality western renaissance western tolerance and then the left
[38:43.080 --> 38:51.640]  invokes all these outside groups to then dominate and make us submit and if they can get us to
[38:51.640 --> 38:56.920]  i have october fest or they can get us to not wear short skirts if they can get us to not dance
[38:56.920 --> 39:03.640]  if they if they can get us to give up our flags our culture we're in a cult so paul watchtons told
[39:03.640 --> 39:08.280]  me a lot about this and i know i've talked to lord montan about it how they're trying to get
[39:08.280 --> 39:11.400]  folks to fly the flags and things as well and now that they're seeing that they're getting
[39:11.400 --> 39:16.600]  excited as part of the uh u-kip you know it's controversial if they don't even have their
[39:16.600 --> 39:21.560]  symbol be the union jack and again you can say what you want about these flags the point is
[39:21.560 --> 39:25.800]  they're being conquered they're being replaced if they can tell you you can't have a flag look at
[39:25.800 --> 39:32.360]  peter southerland in statements insider e you must take more refugees get rid of sovereignty
[39:32.360 --> 39:36.520]  i will ask the government to cooperate this is a quote to recognize that sovereignty is an illusion
[39:36.520 --> 39:40.200]  that sovereignty is an absolute illusion that has to be put behind us close call
[39:40.200 --> 39:46.440]  that's the guy that runs it saying you will take unlimited i mean this is a real conquering paul
[39:47.080 --> 39:51.640]  yeah i mean in relation to the to the u-k flag which you just mentioned in the article a few
[39:51.640 --> 39:56.200]  months ago we had an incident in london right across from the houses of parliament where this
[39:56.200 --> 40:02.120]  guy was carrying around an isis flag he had a kid hoisted up on his shoulder with a huge isis flag
[40:02.120 --> 40:08.040]  bunch of other nos walking around central london the police question him they let him get away
[40:08.040 --> 40:12.920]  nothing happens he can continue flying his isis flag all around central london and then you get
[40:12.920 --> 40:19.000]  these cases where people have been told to remove their flags because it's offensive to immigrants
[40:19.000 --> 40:25.320]  three more cases just recently two years ago denis syed who had three english flags stuck in her
[40:25.320 --> 40:32.200]  taxi was told by the local council in devon to take them off because they breached equality laws
[40:32.200 --> 40:36.840]  so they've actually instituted laws having a bumper sticker with the union jack
[40:36.840 --> 40:41.640]  is not allowed yeah another one taxi drivers in southampton were asked to remove sent george
[40:41.640 --> 40:47.000]  flags from their cars showing they could speak english so that's actually a novelty now in
[40:47.000 --> 40:52.440]  england that a taxi driver is able to speak english but you can't signal that to anyone
[40:52.440 --> 40:59.480]  because that's racist another one laborer ben smith got in hot water with police when he claimed
[40:59.480 --> 41:05.160]  they told him to remove the flag on his parcel shelf because it was offensive to immigrants
[41:05.160 --> 41:10.360]  he was threatened with a 30 pounds fine if he refused to move it from view so that sounded
[41:10.360 --> 41:16.040]  like it was on you know his own private property offensive to immigrants the english flag the police
[41:16.040 --> 41:21.800]  told him to remove it and those are just three cases from you know recently this is globalism
[41:21.800 --> 41:26.440]  where they want it and they're moving to change the names of the national teams not let you fly
[41:26.440 --> 41:32.680]  your flags this is what happens when a foreign army conquers you we have been conquered we're still
[41:32.680 --> 41:37.960]  on air there's still a lot of freedom but the central governments are conquered so it's kind
[41:37.960 --> 41:42.920]  of like the nazis took over paris and a few other state capitals they don't have the provinces
[41:42.920 --> 41:50.520]  completely that's the allegory the the analogy the parallel this is real and now they're saying
[41:50.520 --> 41:55.240]  father and mother's bad now they're coming out on msnbc saying your kids belong to the state
[41:55.240 --> 42:00.040]  i mean they mean business paul and they're going to keep pushing it and this again this has nothing
[42:00.040 --> 42:04.360]  to do with equality because you know we had the story last week no whites allowed seattle yoga
[42:04.360 --> 42:10.360]  class for people of color excludes caucasians so if white people are offended if they're discriminated
[42:10.360 --> 42:16.440]  against it doesn't count because in the oppression olympics white people are ranked at the very bottom
[42:16.440 --> 42:22.520]  of the pile we're handicapped in a race we were bowling balls yeah so again they don't believe
[42:22.520 --> 42:29.160]  inequality another article up on info wars which just went up about 15 minutes ago mtv
[42:29.160 --> 42:35.480]  who basically their channel is all about how bad white people are how we we we behave incorrectly
[42:35.480 --> 42:40.120]  towards minorities how we say the wrong things how everything's politically incorrect they put
[42:40.120 --> 42:49.080]  a video up basically saying that using the phrases no can do and long time no see is racist because
[42:49.080 --> 42:56.600]  back in the 1920s in america chinese immigrants said no can do so even though no chinese people
[42:56.600 --> 43:03.160]  whatsoever even care now and nobody who uses these phrases as even any knowledge of their origins
[43:03.800 --> 43:09.640]  it's still racist and you're bad for using generic daily phrases that everybody uses and english is
[43:09.640 --> 43:15.160]  the world dominant language because it's the ultimate mongrel language of latin three different
[43:15.160 --> 43:23.480]  germanic uh languages as well and is designed to pick up other languages french is dying english
[43:23.480 --> 43:29.240]  grows we take indian words barbeque your native american words we take all these words it is the
[43:29.240 --> 43:34.520]  world language it will be the galactic language we make it off this planet it is the language
[43:34.520 --> 43:40.280]  because it isn't a language it's a mass language from all the countless wars and invasions that took
[43:40.280 --> 43:46.520]  place in what is southern britain today galak all these different languages more than 10 languages
[43:46.520 --> 43:53.160]  in english 500 years ago now there's hundreds of languages in english people hear the asians saying
[43:53.160 --> 43:59.480]  that the the the railway workers no can do and that's a really good term no can do yes and then
[43:59.480 --> 44:06.040]  you you adopt that language you take it on which is true melting pot and that's bad and
[44:07.560 --> 44:12.760]  i saw articles in fact i'm going to tell you guys do this a google um asian group criticizes the
[44:12.760 --> 44:19.160]  martian for not enough asians we went and saw the martian last night super boring super stupid
[44:19.160 --> 44:25.800]  super politically incorrect myself uh um anthony and paul super i mean i want to get your
[44:25.800 --> 44:30.520]  brief review you know you're being here doing this total mind control the whole thing politically
[44:30.520 --> 44:36.680]  correct and women are in charge of everything men are bumbling idiots except for the martian
[44:36.680 --> 44:45.880]  uh met demon uh and it's just we can't even build our rockets we have to go to the communist chinese
[44:45.880 --> 44:52.760]  shows the bullet bureau in china saving america with the communist voting to save our astronaut
[44:53.320 --> 44:57.400]  well it's the russian boosters we've got to have so it's not even accurate
[44:58.840 --> 45:03.880]  i mean the chinese rockets most of them blow up the u.s rockets blow up it's the russians
[45:03.880 --> 45:07.560]  still have the best heavy lifters but they don't even have the russians in it the people sitting
[45:07.560 --> 45:13.640]  there don't even know the whole movie is international propaganda and it's every movies like
[45:13.640 --> 45:20.360]  this folks they just hammer you with brainwashing sorry go ahead and the whole movie worships chinese
[45:20.360 --> 45:29.080]  people and then the chinese group bitches to add more to it i mean the chinese space program even
[45:29.080 --> 45:34.840]  when they went into lower earth orbit there were questions serious questions asked you know if they
[45:34.840 --> 45:39.560]  faked that footage because it just looked like they were doing it underwater so for the chinese to
[45:39.560 --> 45:44.520]  come to the rescue in this film and it was we're not bashing the chinese they're real smart the point
[45:44.520 --> 45:52.200]  is we use russian heavy lifters the movie is horse crap all of its deception all of its bs it's god
[45:52.200 --> 45:58.440]  i'm sick of the lying demonic culture no it and i sit there in the theater packed with all these
[45:58.440 --> 46:04.040]  victims all these stupid victims having no idea we're being hit with high-tech propaganda and
[46:04.040 --> 46:09.000]  they were all laughing at it it wasn't even funny i mean we both fell asleep before the end of it it
[46:09.000 --> 46:14.760]  was so mind-numbingly anties like stop it we're storing yeah he's sitting between us but i don't
[46:14.760 --> 46:19.160]  know why it's got such good reviews because it's obviously contrived political correctness you know
[46:19.160 --> 46:24.200]  women in positions of power minorities in positions of power the chinese they save the day
[46:24.200 --> 46:29.240]  and that's fine you know but when it's deliberately done just to be pc and then there's bitching that
[46:29.240 --> 46:34.440]  there's too many white people in yeah so yes and you know matt daemon got in trouble for saying that
[46:34.440 --> 46:39.400]  for saying that people should be cast for roles in hollywood based on their talent not their skin
[46:39.400 --> 46:44.440]  color that's true it well and it's true that when you have a certain propaganda films it's all about
[46:44.440 --> 46:48.440]  minorities but then when it's other ones it's all white people like i'm noticed with children's
[46:48.440 --> 46:52.200]  cartoons with new ones it's either all white people or it's all minorities so there's a lot
[46:52.200 --> 46:56.440]  of weird social engineering going on man it's really weird because they're testing this stuff on us
[46:56.440 --> 47:03.080]  yeah and another facet of the mtv article which just went up is they basically say she makes the
[47:03.080 --> 47:09.160]  argument that laws target gypsies in different european cities around the world the opposite is
[47:09.160 --> 47:15.000]  true i mean i lived next to a gypsy camp and she's on there saying oh even saying even using the
[47:15.000 --> 47:19.560]  word gypsy is bad and saying that they might steal and saying that they might break the law
[47:19.560 --> 47:24.280]  i mean that's how they got the stereotype because of their behavior not because of where they come
[47:24.280 --> 47:29.320]  from or their skin color the culture is and there's of course different groups but the dominant you
[47:29.320 --> 47:35.720]  know mainline group in europe it's the romans or whatever you call them it is the culture to rob
[47:35.720 --> 47:41.800]  you because you're scum yeah it is the culture to kidnap children it happens all the time i mean
[47:42.760 --> 47:48.040]  i mean my mother i all of us have had gypsies i mean try to rob us in in in rome and i guess
[47:48.040 --> 47:53.240]  i'll just roll over and you know go take everything you're a god oh this didn't just happen
[47:53.240 --> 47:59.480]  no there are organized gypsy gangs that use children to rob people in major european cities
[47:59.480 --> 48:06.040]  in madrid paris it's an epidemic and in england if the gypsies now this is the pikey's the irish
[48:06.040 --> 48:12.200]  gypsies this is bad they steal your travel trailers and they go well that's their culture and they
[48:12.200 --> 48:17.800]  let them keep it you can pull up bbc yeah it was just done there yeah oh they just put it up i mean
[48:17.800 --> 48:23.880]  they are allowed to steal your house and keep it but you're racist for even pointing it out it's like
[48:23.880 --> 48:28.920]  we're trying to fix the behavior and say why is this a negative aspect of this culture but they
[48:28.920 --> 48:33.560]  don't even allow us to have the discussion in the first place because it's racist it's like you know
[48:33.560 --> 48:38.040]  black people in the united states make up 13 percent of the population commit half of the
[48:38.040 --> 48:43.720]  homicides it's not because of their skin color it's because of this you know gangster glorification
[48:43.720 --> 48:47.960]  blacks were not killing each other until the 50s yeah so we need to and it was because they brought
[48:47.960 --> 48:51.400]  all the drugs in i mean if that was the liberal social engineering you can really blame that on
[48:51.400 --> 48:56.120]  the central government more social engineering again the same social engineers that will tell
[48:56.120 --> 49:00.520]  you mommy and daddy are bad are the ones that ship crack cocaine into the inner city yeah and it's
[49:00.520 --> 49:06.040]  you know like mtv some of the boss is named the big guy redstone you know it's all run by you know
[49:06.040 --> 49:11.800]  white billionaires creating this gangster culture which keeps black people oppressed keeps them in
[49:11.800 --> 49:16.200]  the ghetto and they're all and 90 percent of black people are killed by other black people but we
[49:16.200 --> 49:21.080]  can't discuss any of that we can't try to stop black people from killing other black people
[49:21.080 --> 49:26.360]  because it's racist even to say it in the first place Paul what are you working on right now
[49:26.360 --> 49:32.200]  from full wars dot com um i've got an interview coming up tomorrow with gad sad who is a behavioral

[50:20.840 --> 50:26.200]  that's trendy now a million political dissidents in gulags that's trendy yeah it's always these
[50:26.200 --> 50:31.320]  really weak pathetic ignorant people they want to wear nazi flags to think it has power but
[50:31.320 --> 50:35.400]  they know that's not trendy so communist is cool even though it's killed five times the nazi's
[50:35.400 --> 50:39.560]  step yeah that's trendy that's cool that's acceptable and they've got literally no idea what
[50:39.560 --> 50:43.720]  they're advocating well in the trendiest areas all over they have these mal bars mal restaurants
[50:43.720 --> 50:48.440]  stalling bars yeah they had to close those down in london because chinese people got
[50:48.440 --> 50:53.720]  rightly offended over it and they made no money out yeah the communists even removed mal at the end
[50:53.720 --> 50:59.320]  and imprisoned his wife paul but we're informed that's what we're able to stay with us most of us

[54:48.840 --> 54:56.520]  locally people don't like this across america so they're saying no and that's why the feds are
[54:56.520 --> 55:00.760]  coming in with the globalist with the u in and announcing they're going to be over local police
[55:00.760 --> 55:06.440]  departments and monitoring them and doing community organizing and them stirring up trouble and using

[57:26.120 --> 57:32.200]  deal they said we could do because we get these deals from my patriot free shipping and i didn't
[57:32.200 --> 57:37.320]  read the full memo i mean i remember hearing it but i just didn't think about it major brain glitch
[57:38.840 --> 57:45.560]  free shipping on food is huge and so i don't like to say i'm wrong but it looks like this deal is
[57:45.560 --> 57:50.440]  basically i guess they did the numbers as good as the last deal so i said that was introductory
[57:50.440 --> 57:58.120]  that was only all we could do well actually this is as good as good on some of the deals that may
[57:58.120 --> 58:02.680]  even be better some of the others not it depends on which package it is but this is the best deal

[58:57.800 --> 59:03.080]  a product like survival shield nason iodine x2 it's something that really has been hiding in plain
[59:03.080 --> 59:08.680]  view for over 100 years the federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine
[59:08.680 --> 59:13.480]  accrued form of it be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary
[59:13.480 --> 59:18.840]  deficiency in iodine was causing i want to challenge the listeners who've not tried x2 for yourselves

[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:54.760]  phone calls frank in new york thanks for calling in today you're on the air hey alex how are you
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:01:00.600]  god bless you and your crew you guys do a fantastic job thank you brother i have a question for
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:05.160]  your actually a statement for your first time listeners if you think alex jones was kidding
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:09.960]  around about immigration all you have to do is look at the mic report if you read the mic report
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:15.800]  it states that if you don't accept immigration or people are anti-immigration you're a terrorist
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:19.960]  if you don't believe me look it up for yourselves and you know and you'll speak that room talking about
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:25.160]  absolutely and it says ron paul if you like ron paul you're a terrorist if you like the second
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:29.480]  amendment you're a terrorist if you like erin russo you're a terrorist of course we broke that
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:32.760]  document and people didn't believe it was real for a week and the feds wouldn't know it's real
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:37.480]  i mean people didn't believe it when we broke two years ago because it was on the army's website
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:42.440]  that they have reeducation camps and people went and looked and said it's actually on the army site
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:50.440]  i mean they're not playing games but see the military's awake because they're now being trained
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:56.200]  for this and so the feds are seeing who freaks out who doesn't go along with it so they're purging
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:01.640]  the military brass that won't go along with it so i'm not trying to scare people into hiding out
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:06.280]  because of this we need to get vocal and say no and use the fact that the government's so evil
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:12.120]  against it to kick these usurpers out these are hijackers these are this is not our government
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:19.160]  go ahead can we another comment if i may please about the pope um i'm a catholic and um a lot of
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:23.800]  of my hispanic community actually are devoted catholic um unfortunately a lot of them actually
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:30.120]  believe in the pope so basically um i actually showed them the video about about jesus um failing
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:35.480]  on the cross and then basically another commentating me in the un saying that um i caught me in my name
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:39.400]  and they couldn't believe it when actually they saw it for themselves i mean they were really
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:44.840]  devastated and shocked and i saw him this guy's a false prophet and this guy's a deceiver of people
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:51.480]  well we know that he basically is 150 degrees different than pope john polis second on 180 he
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:57.480]  says some good things but overall his actions and we know that they blackmailed the vatican into
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:03.320]  putting him in so that's come out i mean there's two popes right now folks and this this is big
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:08.520]  and notice it's all happening right now so i'm not bashing catholics i've never been anti-catholic
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:14.760]  catholics i know are just great people across the board uh so i've been kind of uh you know
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:18.840]  the other way where i've defended catholics and like catholics have been criticized for it
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:22.520]  by a lot of protestants and patriot groups who were worried about the vatican
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:29.000]  but now that this pope's gone this far um i mean i've just got to say whoever he is he is bad news
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:37.240]  anything else frank so there's alex yes sir go ahead yes yes one more yes one more thing um
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:42.120]  you know john polis second um he wasn't a good guy he was not a good pope as well because he
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:48.440]  basically said i think it was on december 12 1984 he made a statement saying that come to him
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:54.520]  for forgiveness don't come to god come for come to him so he he wasn't as radical as this pope is
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:59.720]  but all popes are actually bad if you really study all of them they've had their attendance as well too
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:05.320]  listen i'm not the super expert on it and i hear what you're saying i just tried to stay out of
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:10.680]  sectarian fighting and all this and just promote liberty um but regardless if the catholic church
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:17.640]  was was had problems before it's really sunk to a new low now i don't think we can debate that
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:24.120]  and so where do you think this is all going well unfortunately um it's basically going to
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:29.640]  to a new word order look what you're on your guest said yesterday that that Italian person saying that
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:33.800]  you know that this pope's job is almost done basically to usher in the new word order it's
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:38.920]  scary guys people wake up because we're in big trouble if you don't wake up i still gotta say
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:45.000]  about it well said my friend god bless you appreciate the call we're gonna go to uh woody
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:52.200]  adam brad roger and many others on the other side 800 2599231 and i can't live out to read
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:56.440]  this headline on air but i am parental discretion is advised when we come back stay with us
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:26.520]  percentage of all causes of death alcohol related deaths are over twice as common as deaths
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:31.480]  involving firearms even more interesting one third of gun deaths are alcohol related so according
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:36.200]  to gun control logic we could eliminate one third of gun related deaths overnight by banning alcohol
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:40.600]  yet you'll notice that mom's man action and other bloomberg back groups aren't demanding we ban
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:45.160]  booze and beer that's because the true agenda behind gun control is to control the population
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:49.080]  because the government can only expand at the expense of individual rights such as the second
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:53.000]  amendment ronald mackin of the mesis institute wrote an excellent article breaking all of this

[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:22.360]  jesse ventura has put out a new version of his best-selling book american conspiracies
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.960]  we've kind of had some heated debates the last few times he was on

[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:37.320]  we're also obviously going to get into what i mentioned earlier the big syria developments
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:44.680]  and now the washington post is asking the question today did us weapons supplied to syrian rebels
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:53.640]  draw russia into the conflict i don't know does you know does barack obama wear a suit
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:09:03.160]  and a tide or the state of the union hope francis is out again warning about conspiracy theories
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:11.080]  about the vatican we're also going to get more into school suspense student over pro veteran shirt
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:17.080]  and see the shirt up on info wars dot com obama has come out and said yes i would win if i ran for
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:23.640]  president again i'd love to do some more we're going to play that video sheriff clark noticed
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:27.480]  everybody's picked up the meme that drudge launched here last tuesday it has been picked up by hundreds
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:32.520]  of different groups and people and it's not that people didn't already know this but but we need
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:38.360]  to really push the fact that the left has armed bodyguards that obama has all these guards that
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:43.000]  they were even criticizing in the news yesterday that donald trump admits he has a concealed carry
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.120]  like how dare you carry a gun like you know mexican drug cartel said they want to kill you and
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:53.960]  you're worth all these billions of dollars and are a major kidnapping target this is just crazy
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:59.800]  that you think you have a right to have a gun well then who can have a gun it's total discrimination
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:07.320]  so it ties into that sheriff clark's come out and said obama wants to disarm people
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.080]  he should start with his own security staff
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:15.800]  so we're going to play those clips coming up and again i know we know all this but
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:21.960]  bernie sanders says we need to ban semi-automatic rifles and he says because they're only meant to
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:29.320]  kill people well yes they are meant for killing people that's their first use is if someone tries
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:33.960]  to kill you someone tries to attack you and the criminals have heavy armament they're going
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:37.720]  to get guns regardless of what you do look at mexico the total gun ban for citizens
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:41.720]  and the highest crime rate in the world 100 plus thousand dead the last eight years that we know of
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.080]  and he just says it with his idiot followers who don't understand because they never own guns
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:53.080]  all you need these four is to kill people they kill people well then why does the government have
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:59.800]  them i mean if isis is attacking you you fight them with weapons that are at least as good
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:05.800]  or if i come into my downstairs and there's three criminals in my house
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:07.800]  and they're armed i'm going to take them out
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:15.400]  and the best thing to do it was a high-powered 308 rifle or a 223
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:26.760]  i mean i said i'd go to your phone calls it's just they're praying on people
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:32.840]  have you ever been around the average democrat they're either a college graduate that thinks
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:37.160]  they're super intellectual and are really stupid and are just kept on this little reservation of
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:42.760]  fear and are real neurotic about their political correctness or they are the most vapid airheaded
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:47.640]  well you've seen mark dice videos there's a new one out today mind control morons don't even understand
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:55.960]  what silver is on video and you talk to nine out of ten they want to put all gun owners in a camp
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:00.200]  we're going to put gun owners in a camp we're going to arrest them life in prison all gun owners

[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:10.760]  conservatives too buddy i hear he has to put them in jail and you're talking to like you know 60 70
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:18.440]  year old people that speak well and you say to them we want to put gun owners in forced labor camps
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:21.880]  and they say yeah so we're going to put them in slave camps absolutely you want to tell me

[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:33.480]  they just would love to know we were all in prison they want to dominate us they know we're the
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:38.920]  producers they know we're smarter than them they know we're stronger than them and they just get
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:44.920]  off on the evil they just get off on the power when you let scum take over folks they don't build
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:52.680]  incredible factories and and monuments and buildings and launch navies and and have inventions
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:58.680]  they build cultures of imprisonment and enslavement and domination
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:07.160]  they want to take you over they want to dominate you they say your kids belong to them
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:13.000]  they tell you what words you're going to use they tell you lower your flags the american flag
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.280]  the union jack the british flag take them down they're hateful we're offended you don't have any
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:24.600]  speech do what we say and it's directed by the government all these huge immigrant populations
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:28.840]  will just assimilate they used to love america they would want to be part of the country and are good
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:35.800]  for the country overall except now they're being twisted to evil let's go to your phone calls woody
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:41.480]  in washington thanks for calling today on this monday worldwide edition go ahead hi alex how you
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:46.760]  doing today good brother thank you for calling yes i'd like to make a couple of comments number one
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:53.400]  is the united nation small arms treaty that was signed by our secretary of state john carrey early
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:14:03.080]  this year uh if you read the uh the actual agreement it says that no uh signature participating uh
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:10.360]  country will allow their civilian population to possess any firearms whatsoever i know i mean
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:15.320]  we've read it on air it's a total gunman and then obama gets up there listen unidire when they
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:23.400]  first passed the treaty at the un level in 2001 in july of 2001 you can read this uh it was in
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:28.520]  the new american magazine but george uh some of my archivist folks actually went down and got it
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:34.360]  from the united nations archive in new york and because they have a library there and it said
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:39.880]  civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:45.560]  so they say the state must have the power monopoly citizens cannot be armed it's all
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:49.960]  about the state dominating they know this they've disarmed everybody else yes sir and now they've
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:54.040]  got to implement the treaty here because other countries have already done it and they've got
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:15:00.040]  to take our guns go ahead well that's why the united nations is here now and that's why we're
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:07.160]  seeing all this humanization of the police and i just want to say that uh i'm retired police
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:12.840]  and uh when they put body cameras on every police officer in in this country they are
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:22.280]  going to remove the one human critical element and that is discretion so technology is a double
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:29.400]  edge sword it cuts both ways no i agree i used to be for the body cameras until i got more sophisticated
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:34.360]  and i realized what i want that because now they're gonna nitpick on the good people and get rid of
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:38.280]  them and then the bad ones are going to be able to do whatever they want because again it's centrally
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:44.120]  controlled by bad people they're in a war against the police and we've got to understand it's it's a
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:49.720]  federal push for these cameras to federalize the police and it's not a good idea should there be
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:55.320]  cameras on the cars absolutely but when it goes to the next level of gps and all the rest of it
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:16:01.080]  then the cops are going to enforce on us when we all have gps taxing us by the mile as well see
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:07.560]  yeah when you remove discretion you are going to take away the key essential human element
[01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:13.880]  that will actually make it a horrible situation for the police to do their jobs and the citizens
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:19.560]  will pay the price for that well let's be clear let's say you're in a place where they've written
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:24.920]  the laws where guns are really illegal and the cop pulls over a family they see stuff's going on
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:30.600]  they see a deer rifle underneath the seat they know that the law is unconstitutional uh and
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:34.520]  then they just kind of don't see that gun the problem is when it's all on camera they're going
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:39.480]  to be able to enforce all this globalism down through the local police and federalize them
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:43.240]  and of course you talk about discretion it's going to go way beyond that absolutely it's a
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:48.840]  nightmare situation we should have no federal control over police then the cities can decide
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:53.800]  whether they have body cameras or whatever go ahead yeah the police will become specifically
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:59.240]  enforcers they will no longer be police peace officers the last thing I'd like to say is that
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:07.960]  the million man march occurred here saturday in dc and the model for their march was justice or
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:17.160]  health uh got no play basically in the mass media propaganda machine and uh i think the american
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:23.240]  people and i know a lot of retired law enforcement people a lot of retired military are taking notice
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:30.200]  this but the nation of islam is becoming a very powerful entity in this country
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:38.680]  well clearly they've been told via the white house they're following the george sorrell's
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:45.000]  white house script right now to hype everybody up and to say basically go out you know and get the
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.400]  police which again has meant to smash the police and then they're going to bring in the feds and
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:55.000]  it's a takeover it's what alsharpon said and as bad as some police are it's part of the rotting of
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:00.600]  the culture and when george sorrell's and the white house are trying to make the police enemy
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:06.840]  number one you know what the paradigm is but i know this number one most awake group uh woody
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:11.880]  is the military veterans number two is the police and again big problems in the police i
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:16.600]  criticize it i try to stop them being twisted i try to stop them being taken over but cops on
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:22.040]  average are more awake than anybody in the general civilian population on average and that's why this
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:26.280]  is happening and have you not seen the police officers you know and others really starting
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:31.000]  to understand the master plan now is there a an awakening you're seeing or are they just
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:37.880]  replacing people with numbskulls well they are replacing people with numbskulls that's been going
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:43.080]  on for the last decade and they've been they've been hiring people with criminal records uh
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:48.920]  that the problem is is that the the police now have developed a circle the wagons mentality
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:54.760]  and well they are awake they they i think most of the police officers that i know
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:19:01.160]  retired and active are very awake of what's going on but there were under such a barrage
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:08.520]  from the demonization campaign from the propaganda machine that uh the wagons have been circled and
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:14.600]  the only way that i can see that that that we can get out of this is for the american people
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:21.480]  to wake up and start supporting their police in mass and uh that would that would get the police
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:27.240]  out of that circle circling of the wagons but you gotta add support the police with an anti-globalist
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:33.080]  message of understanding why this is happening and for them to reform themselves so they can
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:38.440]  be honorable peace officers do you agree with that i agree with that yes it's gotta be done god
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:43.960]  bless you folks this is the breaking of america you mean this is a takeover and they want to
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:50.040]  destroy local government as bad as it is it's not globalist in most areas austin is run by the u n
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:56.440]  officially it's very very sad uh but even our police know that we'll be back with adam and others

[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:26.440]  i want to be clear every segment we're not being alarmist here the federal government
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:31.000]  with the ford foundation the cia the mainstream media
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:39.640]  i mean it's in the news the cia is involved in social engineering propaganda psi ops and has
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:45.960]  hired more than 20 000 psychiatrists to help work with the news to pacify the american people
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:53.960]  obama signed an executive order three weeks ago on it they legalized it last year repealed the law
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:00.360]  there's the washington post how the american government's trying to control what you think
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:06.840]  and you say wow you know last year the arming the undersecretary of defense came out and
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:11.800]  admitted an hour-long press conference that we've been lying to you but we're going to stop now and
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:16.600]  we're going to work with every local radio and tv station every newspaper and the pentagon's going
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:24.680]  to be in your community helping and the cia is going to be helping and they actually had young
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:29.560]  innocent information officers get up in their military uniforms and they go i'm sick of lying to
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:33.880]  people the public doesn't like us i'm going to get to tell the truth they go thank you man for
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:37.800]  your question sit down now and all these older men and women were just shaking their heads she
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:45.320]  didn't get it that that was a psi op that they were you have to hide it in plain view when you do
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:54.120]  something as brazen as putting the cia on the streets watch the video government promises
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:57.880]  a stop line because of drudge report spotlight but then you get into the article that's not really
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:06.200]  what it is and don salazar alex jones article this is the occupational government does that
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:11.320]  mean the average person in the cia is a bad person no most of them are compartmentalized
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:18.360]  most of them are analysts it's not like james bond that's a very small part of it
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:25.720]  i mean when the cia once people killed the army does it at least until recently and
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:32.840]  and the analysts have been going public first 50 of them then 100 plus then the former general who
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:37.960]  just left a few months ago comes out and says we've been ordered to lie to you with the intelligence
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:41.960]  we were premeditatedly ordered to arm al qaeda which we knew would become isis we're running
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:46.520]  while the president didn't know no no no we were ordered to do it they consciously did
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:55.080]  is that clear then the deputy director of the cia goes on cnn and cbs on a weekend and says the same
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:27:01.960]  thing and says this needs to be investigated so it's so immoral these guys are scared when they're
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:07.480]  saying i see the body language it's so immoral it's so evil these are like germans like urwin
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:13.880]  rommel in nazi germany the desert fox more highly decorated than even hitler in world war one big
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:19.640]  war hero top general of world war two undoubtedly he was going to overthrow hitler and operation
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:25.240]  valkyrie he'd been strafed in his car was already half paralyzed but he was running running the
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:29.320]  operation to kill hitler they came to his house so we're not going to kill your whole family
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:32.360]  just drive on the road take cyanide write a note that you committed suicide
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:43.800]  these guys are all one step away from that one step away you know former top generals
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:48.680]  former heads of special forces and others have bodyguards they have to pay for all the time
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:53.640]  and hardly leave their houses now because they've been covertly killing them with heart attacks and
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:28:04.520]  stuff i talked to him do you understand this ladies and gentlemen do you understand this
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:10.360]  i talked to the former head of special forces i talked to the former head of army intelligence
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:17.400]  i talked to the former i've talked to multiple heads of formerly of special forces they all know
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:23.800]  all this you think this is a joke you think this shows a game you think any of this no no this is
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:29.000]  real people and i've been praying a lot about this and we can see it's all moving it's worse than
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:35.160]  we thought we kept hoping america was still here and that it wouldn't get so crazy but i've just
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:41.720]  got to impress upon you that this country has been taken over and you heard that former cop
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:48.520]  earlier how concerned he was smart guy the government is seized by people that are trying
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:54.680]  to take all the anger at the corrupt government and focus it on the police random cops every week
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:29:01.560]  are just being shot in the back and a lot of dumbasses go well that'll show the cops quit
[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:04.840]  being so arrogant you know they've been shooting yeah there've been some crazy cops some psychos
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:08.680]  bad guys they've been protected it's wrong in many areas but they're indicting most of them
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:16.360]  they're getting in trouble but that's not the issue the globalists are running an operation
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:21.320]  to bully and terrorize the police into submitting to the takeover
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:31.720]  so you know you got a bold crazy government in charge when they're planning a civil war
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:38.360]  so we need the police and we need the military to keep speaking out and they are i mean our
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:43.480]  military exposed that our government's running al-qaeda our military on this show colonel shaffer
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:49.320]  and others years ago so the good news is the government's full of good people we're on the march
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:54.680]  the empire's on the run that news is alex jones and the gcr radio network
[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:03.880]  k daniels info wars dot com the college newspaper claimed that concealed carry is an example of
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:08.840]  white privilege you heard that right an article in a daily text in the campus newspaper of the
[01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:13.720]  university of texas at austin said quote based on the historical president of black people
[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:18.680]  framed as dangerous the new gun policy which legalizes concealed carry on campus will endanger
[01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:23.320]  black students who choose to exercise their new rights but here's the ironic part the same article
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:28.040]  also pointed out the historic link between gun control and jim crow laws before the civil war
[01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:32.440]  southerners passed laws to keep guns away from slaves and freed black slaves to stifle potential
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:37.160]  revolt article stated after the civil war and during the rise of the coup clux land southern
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:41.880]  laws were passed disarmed the black man the article also referred to how california lawmakers passed
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:46.760]  an open carry ban in response to the black panthers this article is a microcosm of leftist logic
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:51.080]  ban the guns because of so-called white privilege even though gun control grew out of racism once

[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:41.400]  what this shadow global government is is the snake it's cobra and then they have had news
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:45.640]  articles going jones believes cobra is real and runs things you know i say clearly in the video
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:52.120]  it's an allegory our government has been hijacked by criminal international above the law diplomatically
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:56.600]  immune combines worth hundreds of trillions of dollars that they've stolen they've signed us
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:01.640]  on the derivatives they have enslaved us through fraud they are running radical islam and using
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:08.040]  it to bring down europe right now they lower the borders they stir up the middle east they
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:14.920]  advertise everything's free come to germany come to france come to spain we're going to arrest you
[01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:25.400]  if you criticize it i'm going to go to brad roger mj elie kevin and many others here in just a few
[01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:31.640]  minutes but i wanted to play a few clips first since i mentioned this earlier here's bernie
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:36.440]  sanders on banning assault rifles that means semi-automatics because they they're designed to kill
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:44.120]  people well yeah they're designed to defend yourself and criminals can use them but that's
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:50.680]  what the second amendment's for and then secondarily it's about feeding yourself for plinking or
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:57.160]  hunting or having fun but a free person a person is not a slave to quote thomas jefferson has the
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:06.120]  right to own guns and it's a fight between the logical people that know more guns means less
[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:13.000]  crime and the poor fools that have never been around guns every metric every study every poll
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:17.720]  shows we're winning the fight against abortion in the hearts and minds we're winning those we're
[01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:21.880]  on the offensive that's why the enemy's moving so fast in a counter offensive and we're winning the
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:31.880]  fight on guns and that's why i was told by history channel by discovery channel by a any
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:39.320]  and by the one of the major production companies that produces reality television
[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:43.480]  that three years ago the order came down and i talked about at the time and you saw at the news
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:49.320]  that they were going to cancel all the major pro gun shows that were number one on every channel
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:39:00.600]  number one for those channels were gun shows and by the way i host
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:12.360]  currently two shows on discovery two on history it's not like i'm just here saying all this
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:16.600]  i'm the main commentator on four shows that are currently hearing
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:24.840]  so believe me i've been offered a lot tv shows and
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:36.520]  and that shows you the power of this takeover that they're losing hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:46.280]  not airing pro gun shows on history and discovery channel and a and a and you notice they've just
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:54.280]  canceled the big outdoor channel that was a giant profit system for that particular company we had
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:40:02.680]  ted newton on a month ago about it so there's a move going on because you know why they attack
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:06.520]  where they're weak they want to take over local government they want to take over the states because
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:10.280]  that's the natural response to a taken over federal government that's the rallying point
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:16.680]  through government legitimacy they are attacking the gun culture because if you take a trendy out
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:22.360]  and you teach him to shoot mike judge and i not once not twice but three times he's back in town
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:25.880]  he tried to go see him go out to his house i just got a call yesterday i need to call him
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:30.040]  not name dropping us remember i need to call him he brings out a bunch of hollywood people out to
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:35.960]  his big ranch we sit up there on his backport shooting down like 500 guards 50 cows you name it
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:43.240]  i took the the cast of silicon valley not once but twice shooting in his ranch i brought out a
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:49.640]  bunch of guns and judge and i were there we're like yeah we're here to uh make you not be anti-gun
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:54.280]  and within an hour of them shooting they were all pro-gun and said yeah i should be able to have one
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:41:02.200]  of these none of them were pro-gun of like 11 12 people the cast of silicon valley one of the top
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:09.480]  shows on HBO it was that easy and and we religiously did that he brings them here
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:17.560]  takes them out shooting and then we just sit there and crack a beer after we're done and just
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:26.280]  had a satisfying conversion to people becoming armed and they all go i get it now it's just weird
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:30.200]  until i shot and it was so easy and it was fun and you know these women were shooting bull's eyes
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:34.440]  and stuff at 200 yards and getting all excited and all and and and they were learning safety and
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:43.960]  everything and we're sitting there and they go yeah criminals are gonna have them why shouldn't
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:53.880]  i have them i can be trusted i'm not bad like these women we're like yeah it wouldn't be feminist for
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:58.440]  women to be armed because they say the feminists say women shouldn't have guns why women should be
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:07.800]  armed i'm just like sitting there just seeing it happen that's how we're going to defeat these
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:13.080]  people and see they got our kids in the schools they're teaching them your mommy and daddy aren't
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:23.320]  your boss here's how you perform fallatio it's all just just infantile silliness but that's
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:29.400]  just the cover of the non-threatening oh we're a culture of fun just join us just mesh with us
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:36.360]  just sink into the quicksand with us oh goofy goofy so the men run around acting stupid and
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:40.040]  then women are repulsed by him and then go off and find some butch woman to be with because they

[01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:49.000]  want to see strengthened and expanded i voted to ban certain types of assault weapons which are
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:54.360]  designed only to kill people i voted to end the so-called gun show looper what i did say
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:59.480]  is that we can keep shouting at each other which is what's going on here between arms
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:04.280]  in going nowhere and kids on campuses and children in schools are being slaughtered
[01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:09.720]  what i think there needs to be is a dialogue and here's what i do believe chuck i believe
[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:16.760]  what i would call common sense gun reform plus a revolution in mental health making sure that
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:22.200]  if people are having a nervous breakdown or uh suicidal or homicidal they get the care they
[01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:26.600]  need when they need it right there i think they're almost all these people got their guns illegally
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:34.920]  almost all these people they knew were mentally ill and did nothing plus crime with guns is down
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:41.960]  51% conservatively professor lot says 61 whatever the fbi says 51 let's just take their number
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:47.560]  since 1992 167 people die here in mass shootings most of those are gang related
[01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:55.720]  it's i mean it's nothing 60 plus percent of the 11 000 plus people that die every year it's always
[01:45:55.720 --> 01:46:02.840]  below 12 000 or suicides and you know you guys are for assisted suicide right out there i don't
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:07.400]  want the state involved but if you got bone cancer you're in incredible pain you want to blow your
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:18.920]  head off go ahead that's how men kill themselves we blow our heads off women take pills women are
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:23.400]  going to get pills men are going to get guns if you don't give them that they'll jump off a cliff
[01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:33.800]  and they all know this they sit there praying the children are being slaughtered yeah because
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:39.320]  you advertise these places where these mentally ill people instead of suicide by cop the new thing
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:43.560]  is you know go down and shoot people but thank god we've lowered the crime rate so much with this
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:48.360]  revolution of arming the american people that it's gone way down even though the mentally ill people
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:55.560]  attacking schools went up it's flat overall because other shootings went down on schools the gang
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:47:01.560]  related ones went down the crazy people went up but it's flat all other shootings are down mass
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:09.000]  shootings are flat the last 20 years look it up yourself flat now let's go to sheriff clark again

[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:24.200]  saying it's time for the armed class the people with bodyguards to turn their guns in
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:29.720]  it's time for them to just shut up i mean bernie sanders has secret service detail hey pull them

[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:33.880]  goes into his political bag of tricks to see what he can accomplish on his agenda and then i think
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:38.280]  that that's sad that he exploits these people and they saw right through it that's why i said i'm
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:41.960]  glad they did it you know there's a certain amount of respect for the president of the united state
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:48.760]  but when he uh takes advantage and uses them uh to achieve a political agenda i'm glad to see that
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:54.760]  they uh that they slap back this is a do as i say not as i do president and he speaks as he's
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:59.480]  surrounded by this protective bubble which he should have with the arm secret service if he

[01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:12.840]  and said he thinks standards may not even have secret service yet because the black lives matter
[01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:17.720]  example i think when you pull a certain number become number two during a campaign you automatically
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:22.840]  get them i know when you're the nominee you do we'll have to look into that the point is whether
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:28.200]  it's barack obama hillary clinton you know the speaker of the house michael more we know has
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:31.960]  armed bodyguards they've been arrested before having guns in legal areas they're hypocrites
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:36.920]  but there is the washington post saying should bernie sanders have secret service protection
[01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:45.560]  the point is is that he is basically on the bloomberg wagon to try to take our guns
[01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:49.640]  and obama said he wouldn't politicize mass shootings but he did that in oregon
[01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:54.920]  and when he arrives there last week and here is a clip of him with the governor
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:55:05.480]  and with the mayor there in roseburg origan there are gonna be i think moments as we go forward
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:09.560]  where we're gonna have to come together and figure out how to stop things like this
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:19.880]  to happen and you know i've got some very strong feelings about this because when you talk to these families
[01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:27.800]  you're reminded that this could be happening to your child or your mom or your dad or your
[01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:35.800]  your relative or your friend and so you know we're gonna have to come together as a country
[01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:42.200]  to see how we can prevent these issues from taking place but today it's about the families
[01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:49.480]  they're grief and the love we feel for them they surely do appreciate all the support
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:54.600]  notice it's horrible audio shot by a handheld camera officially by the white house
[01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:58.840]  they're in such a siege mentality because the thousands of protesters clearly over a thousand
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:04.120]  that they didn't do press conferences they had to hide out inside the college
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:08.280]  hide out inside government facilities to put out their propaganda didn't have a press conference
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:13.960]  because they know they can't stop the people so that's good he wants to come grandstand folks
[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:20.200]  are there and everywhere he goes we should be like hounds after a fox politically to expose him
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:23.400]  let's go to brad and louisiana thanks for holding her on the air brad
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:29.800]  hey cowboy i just wanted to let you know that uh you should you're gonna be the first to know
[01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:37.080]  that i'm no longer racist and i can prove it i had a high level respected source confirm the fact
[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:44.600]  that though i'm Caucasian i do have a color and we found out what color it is and uh it happens to
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:51.560]  be uh eggshell beige so i kept a copy of the swatch of paint from the home improvement paint
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:58.200]  manager in my wallet right behind my uh right behind my driver's license and so i'm a card
[01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:05.320]  carrying person of color now secondly i'd like to know i myself am kind of like a pink like piggy
[01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:14.520]  pink i'm sorry i've seen you into the rosy kind of a hues there a couple of times but yes i'm
[01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:22.360]  official so um i guess anybody can see anything about that and alex about social security and
[01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:30.280]  using the numbers to uh cull out gun owners i called social security administration on
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:38.280]  friday spoke to a woman at length and um to for the purpose of changing uh direct deposit
[01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:43.720]  into uh a check i'm a retired person i'm not sure they're saying that it means that you are
[01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:47.640]  incompetent if you get a direct wire the fbi said and that'll be reason to have your guns taken
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:51.560]  but just look they're gonna use your instant background check with your social security
[01:57:51.560 --> 01:57:59.400]  number to harass you i mean it's just it's so criminal but but she told me that the most that
[01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:08.840]  the treasury department will allow due to problems with cost and and delivery and and return that the
[01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:15.160]  treasury department will not allow an individual to get checks delivered at their house for more than
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:20.840]  two months and you automatically have to go back to direct deposit that's an angle that's an angle
[01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:24.520]  so they make you take direct deposit like a lot of jobs we're gonna call them and confirm that but
[01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:30.120]  i believe you so but you'll still have your guns taken wow whoa that is incredible thank you brad
[01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:33.240]  that's real journalism we're gonna look into that i believe you but we're gonna look at it that's a

[02:00:55.240 --> 02:01:00.520]  maybe i'm in fema region 10 then well you're in fema region 10 sorry it's in fema region nine
[02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:05.880]  there go ahead yeah i'm my mistake well the reason i called you is when i look out fast a global
[02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:11.080]  tyranny is spreading um i i know that you've got a plan to you know get the satellites out and be
[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:15.400]  able to reach people around the world through satellites the next couple of years i just don't
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:20.440]  think you've got that kind of time on your hands and so what i was proposing was i have an idea that
[02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:26.200]  you might not really like but i i think it has to be said um what i think you need to do is go to
[02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:29.720]  your really rich friends like you know mic judge people with hundreds of millions of billions of
[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:35.080]  dollars and ask them for you know half a million a million or even more so you can get the couple
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:39.800]  of the five million whatever it is that you need so you can go global like in the next six months
[02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:46.600]  or so because the bottom line if you don't get on places like uh like in spain or greece in the next
[02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:52.040]  few months you'll never get on because i'll just gonna block you well yeah a lot of these are free
[02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:55.960]  to air though so people pirate a lot of stuff in europe because they know what's going on and we are
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:02:00.840]  on the us satellite now there's little things like tones that that's on now we're just tweaking a few
[02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:04.680]  things then we're gonna start a promotion to get us on some stations in the next few weeks actually
[02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:10.920]  uh so if the money comes in i would do that you know a lot of rich people are nice and and they're
[02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:16.840]  cool uh i've never really asked people for money um while these folks are listeners if they ever
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:21.560]  wanted to come to me with that plan that'd be fine i tend to just fund myself selling products and
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:26.280]  things um but i you know i don't think us just putting our satellite up is going to save the
[02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:30.840]  world itself it's just one more act of resistance it's really the message if we put out the key
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:37.320]  reports the message the truth and people respond to that and realize the tyranny were under the power
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:43.080]  is the people and so uh i hear what you're saying though it would be great to be able to get on
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:48.600]  satellites all over the world sooner and we're trying to do that roger god bless you i appreciate
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:55.560]  your call let's talk to elie and montana you're on the air go ahead how's it going good brother go
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:03:02.280]  ahead all right so i've got two things i want to say real quick number one love your show i've
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:09.480]  been listening for a while now i've been trying to catch up from 2008 and 2009 and um in 2009 i
[02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:15.320]  think you mentioned doing a program where you did flash drives with all of the radio shows on them
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:21.800]  in case your show got taken down and i just wanted to bring that up to you i know one of the guys
[02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:26.760]  uh picked up the call before um it mentioned something about that and then the other question
[02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:34.520]  that i had was where do we draw the line in the sand the hard line in the sand it says this far
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:39.560]  no further i'm going to ask jesse ventura that that's a great question when he joins i was thinking
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:44.280]  about interesting questions to ask him and that's the number one question is in fact tweet your
[02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:51.400]  questions you have for jesse ventura at real alex jones we'll go over some of those what is your line
[02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:58.840]  in the sand and i'll tell you it's forced inoculations that they're now trying to put into law
[02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:07.080]  it's being taken from my political beliefs to a fema camp uh it is uh if the government starts
[02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:15.160]  arresting whole groups of people uh conservatives libertarians veterans liberals whatever uh even
[02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:24.200]  i mean it's not far to that so the line in the sand is being approached that's why that's why
[02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:31.720]  they try to leave kind of the vestiges and vestigial ceremonial signs of freedom around but in germany
[02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:35.080]  he's already crossed the line on the sand they're arresting people that criticize open borders
[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:41.160]  they're actually reactivating the old stasi so there's a leftist tyranny like under bush it was
[02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:45.800]  a right-wing tyranny but it didn't make as much headway under obama there's a leftist tyranny
[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:49.720]  and political correctness that a lot of folks are getting behind it's very very frightening
[02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:53.800]  good to hear from you elie i asked for the flash drives folks can do that themselves
[02:04:53.800 --> 02:04:57.480]  we have our archives online but yeah they come up with censorship systems that they can just shut
[02:04:57.480 --> 02:05:03.080]  everything down kit daniels info wars dot com did you know that guns are less deadly than alcohol
[02:05:03.080 --> 02:05:08.440]  at least 88 000 deaths per year are attributed to alcohol abuse and 30 people per day die in
[02:05:08.440 --> 02:05:13.320]  alcohol related auto accidents in the us alone heavy drinkers are also more prone to violence
[02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:18.760]  suicide and risky sexual behavior in comparison there were 36 000 gun related deaths including
[02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:24.600]  suicides and accidents in the us in 2013 and as percentage of all causes of death alcohol related
[02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:28.680]  deaths are over twice as common as deaths involving firearms even more interesting one
[02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:33.400]  third of gun deaths are alcohol related so according to gun control logic we could eliminate
[02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:37.400]  one third of gun related deaths overnight by banning alcohol yet you'll notice that mom's
[02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:41.880]  man action and other bloomberg back groups aren't demanding we ban booze and beer that's because
[02:05:41.880 --> 02:05:46.280]  the true agenda behind gun control is to control the population because the government can only
[02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:50.440]  expand at the expense of individual rights such as the second amendment ryan mc macken of the
[02:05:50.440 --> 02:05:54.920]  mesis institute wrote an excellent article breaking all of this down including the statistics i cited

[02:07:08.840 --> 02:07:14.360]  nason iodine x2 it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over 100 years the
[02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:19.720]  federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine accrued form of it be added to

[02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:14.200]  conspiracies then of course he had the hit tv show for several seasons that got censored
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:17.720]  uh and then they didn't air it anymore even though it was a hit show one of their top rated
[02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:24.680]  and that was american conspiracies uh conspiracy theory with jesse ventura so very very exciting

[02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:50.680]  better than phone so thanks for doing that man you have really lost some weight buddy you're
[02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:55.320]  looking good well i'm working out i've actually put a few pounds on alex i've been eating too
[02:09:55.320 --> 02:10:00.440]  many desserts lately but uh that's what you do sometimes but when i get back down off the grid
[02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:05.480]  i'll trim up even more and get back in better shape but you know alex did you happen to see the
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:12.040]  lisa ling thing on cnn the other night where she did the special on the mongols motorcycle club
[02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:20.520]  i missed it oh it said shivers up and down my spine alex the show ended with the song that i wrote
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:27.720]  you're kidding no wow that's crazy you were in the mongols motorcycle club tell us about that
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:34.040]  well years and many many moons ago this was way back when i was finishing up my naval career i
[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:40.120]  had finished my second deployment overseas i was riding harley davidson's and i seemed like it seemed
[02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:45.320]  like the right thing to do at the time so no i'm a black and white i'm a member of the mongols
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:52.920]  motorcycle club retired uh but uh they they asked me though when i was there to compose a song for
[02:10:52.920 --> 02:11:00.680]  them for my chapter and i did and here it is 40 45 years later and the club still sings that song
[02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:06.680]  i left my mark alex i was so happy over that i was just grinning year to year i never put it out
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:11.880]  but we videotaped when you and harry dean stanton got up and sang some amazing rock and roll songs
[02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:19.000]  we ought to you're a pretty good singer and pretty good musician oh no not really but i just had
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:24.440]  the laugh though it was a song you know in navy seal training you sing all these songs and i just
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:29.880]  adapted one to the mongols motorcycle club when i became a member and well the show's online we
[02:11:29.880 --> 02:11:33.720]  just showed it maybe we can go to the end is so is it the end of the piece yeah it's right on the
[02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:38.680]  end of the piece where you hear all the and it's heavily censored because there's a few nasty words
[02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:44.440]  in it that they won't allow over regular television well that's that's certainly you know it's crazy
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:48.200]  see something you did a long time ago that it pops back up on national television well it's
[02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:53.880]  it's start we are mongol raiders we're raiders of the night we're dirty blankety blanks who'd rather
[02:11:53.880 --> 02:12:00.760]  blankety blank shifting gears here i've got to bring up syria i've got to bring up all the
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:05.320]  things that are happening but a caller had a question earlier sure what is your line in the
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:10.760]  sand tyranny wise and will you just leave the us if it gets too bad like you kind of halfway done
[02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:19.160]  or will you fight back is there a line in the sand where 1776 is the answer well my line in the sand
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:25.560]  for me would be if they had put me in jail i guess would be the bottom line just the political
[02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:32.520]  president stuff well as long as i'm free and i believe that the the the oath keepers are out
[02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:39.320]  there who stand up for the constitution and the bill of rights as long as those two things are
[02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:45.160]  still intact i'm going to keep doing what i do alex and that is being a vigilant citizen
[02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:51.240]  mouthing off and talking and trying to make this great experiment the united states of america the
[02:12:51.240 --> 02:12:58.360]  best it can be and the only way you do that is to hold their feet to the fire absolutely you're
[02:12:58.360 --> 02:13:04.280]  wearing sunglasses today tell me why i don't know just i'm getting back into jesse the body a little
[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:09.400]  more you know i'm being a little more of a villain now you know they've they've the chris kyle thing
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:13.640]  has turned me back into a villain and i kind of like it so you're going to bring back the pink
[02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:23.640]  boa no maybe an earring or two though i'll tell you uh they are the villains and they masquerade
[02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:26.760]  as the good guys i'm not saying call was a villain but he was certainly been proven in court to
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:31.400]  have lied about you that's a sad thing and in in hurtful obviously to the navy seals and others
[02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:35.160]  but just crazy how they've allowed the seals be politicized we'll talk about an update
[02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:38.760]  in your case i don't even got to that last time there's been some updates but first
[02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:45.080]  what do you make of russia going in already turning ices ices is confirmed to be running
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:50.120]  into iraq right now it's our top generals have come out the former head of defense intelligence
[02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:55.320]  who just resigned five months ago said no we were ordered to create al qaeda and ices in the area
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:59.320]  so our own military is coming out and exposing it and then our government's trying to act like
[02:13:59.320 --> 02:14:04.680]  you know they're actually fighting ices but putin's gone in i mean i tell you i don't romanticize
[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:11.640]  putin but uh you know he is really putting a major crimp in the new world order what do you
[02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:17.880]  make of the whole syria situation well you know it's it's a mess and and what people need to
[02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:24.520]  understand is we created the mess when we went into iraq and the libya situation we destabilized
[02:14:24.520 --> 02:14:31.560]  the whole region so now you've got this chaos that's going on over there now the russians have come in
[02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:38.200]  and uh i tend to agree with donald trump i think the russians are going to get bogged down in
[02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:45.960]  there just like we are i mean we've spent 1.7 trillion dollars in the wars in the middle east
[02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:51.000]  right now imagine what we could have did with that alex they could have made social security
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:57.240]  solvent for a hundred years they could have spent that money and fixed our entire infrastructure
[02:14:57.240 --> 02:15:03.560]  just about throughout the united states of america we're getting bogged down in these unwinnable wars
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:08.760]  and i agree with donald trump i think the same thing could well happen to the soviets or russia
[02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:15.080]  they could get in there and get bogged down in the same mess that we're in i agree with you
[02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:20.520]  but the united states under the peanut document that you covered one of your tv shows rebuilding
[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:25.320]  america's defenses you know written in 2000 issued in april said we're going to go and stir it up
[02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:30.920]  up cause immigrant waves and then create a clash of civilizations and wesley clark as you know in
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:35.480]  two different speeches said i was shown the map of seven nations we were going to take down and
[02:15:35.480 --> 02:15:40.360]  destabilize so hillary didn't screw up when they went to libya the plan was to make it a fell state
[02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:45.640]  they want to break up syria they want to break up iraq so it's premeditated so russia has its only
[02:15:45.640 --> 02:15:53.480]  port and mediterranean there russia basically borders now what's the end game why is it they
[02:15:53.480 --> 02:15:59.320]  want to do all this and these to all these countries and destabilize them what's the end game they
[02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:04.280]  want to flood europe with giant immigrant waves and create another crisis there to demand a
[02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:09.000]  marshal plan to then get trillions to go prop up the middle east it's meant to implode the middle
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:14.840]  east they can come in and rebuild it and take it over that ain't gonna happen no matter what happens
[02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:21.400]  are you kidding me that place is in the stone age to begin with why don't why do we care so much
[02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:28.040]  about it is it strictly the oil it's got to be yeah plus but totally the oil because if there was
[02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:33.240]  an oil there i can't imagine that we'd even have any interest there you're right i mean the globalists
[02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:37.720]  only do something if it helps them on all fronts the the energies key number one but number two
[02:16:37.720 --> 02:16:43.800]  brzezinski wrote the grand chess board in 98 on this that it it controls southern russia it's the
[02:16:43.800 --> 02:16:50.280]  border to china it's the border to europe you control that middle area they believe you control
[02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:56.280]  the whole world well i would beg to differ with them i don't think in today's day and age holding
[02:16:56.280 --> 02:17:02.280]  one particular area will allow you to control the whole world in the in the age of technology
[02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:10.280]  i agree but that aside again i don't understand i i guess it's simply we're willing to trade
[02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:15.080]  blood for oil and it's that simple that's the reason we're there and that's the reason we won't
[02:17:15.080 --> 02:17:20.920]  leave i mean look at ronald reagan when reagan was president the icon of the republican party
[02:17:20.920 --> 02:17:27.080]  our marines lost 200 marines to a truck bomb in lebanon did reagan go to war no he got the
[02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:33.480]  hell out of there you know i don't get this why it's our job to go over there and make that place
[02:17:33.480 --> 02:17:38.360]  right so that's why i asked you alex what's the end game there's got to be a reason they're doing
[02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:44.680]  all oil strategic but also the defense contractors make money on losing wars oh yeah i understand
[02:17:44.680 --> 02:17:50.680]  that there there there's always the war makers that the profiteers the war profiteers like haliburton
[02:17:50.680 --> 02:17:56.360]  who used to be brown brown root when they got the uh billion dollar dredging contract in cameron
[02:17:56.360 --> 02:18:02.760]  bay from lbj and uh you know you know you're always going to have the war profiteers and i guess
[02:18:02.760 --> 02:18:08.520]  it's just they're that powerful that they can control our foreign policy i guess well they've
[02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:14.040]  certainly demonized america i wish russia well taking out isis because they're on their doorstep
[02:18:14.040 --> 02:18:19.160]  attacking russia as well but i agree with you it could be another trap like getting russia to go into
[02:18:19.160 --> 02:18:26.200]  afghanistan in the 80s and this could be a big setup well like i said i i i think anybody that goes
[02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:32.360]  in there is going to get bogged down and it because you you know i always like to talk about a thing
[02:18:32.360 --> 02:18:40.200]  that creates my policy on the middle east believe it or not and it's christopher columbus when he
[02:18:40.200 --> 02:18:46.200]  came on his mission and discovered the united states of america for the anglo-saxon world or
[02:18:46.200 --> 02:18:52.760]  the americas his mission was to find an alternative route to india to avoid the middle east yes the
[02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:59.960]  pirates now alex if they wanted to avoid the middle east back in 1492 nothing's changed there
[02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:06.600]  and columbus even at that time science said the world was flat so if you went out you'd fall off
[02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:12.760]  the earth so columbus was willing to fall off the earth rather than go through the middle east
[02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:17.960]  and i look at people go nothing's changed there wow that's a good point it's just upon being there
[02:19:19.160 --> 02:19:24.040]  well it's certainly true that it's not a very happy place in history and now it's really hellish
[02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:28.680]  and now it's a big problem we're going to go to break i want to get an update on your whole
[02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:33.320]  case with kyle and there's been some developments uh there then i want to shift gears in the election

[02:24:29.400 --> 02:24:33.720]  forward slash show and see the feeds there's only a six minute segment 18 minute segment
[02:24:33.720 --> 02:24:39.320]  coming up we'll go to calls and cover news then but you know i stand by people that i know are in
[02:24:39.320 --> 02:24:44.600]  the right and the reason we raise this is it's about assassination of people's character they've
[02:24:44.600 --> 02:24:49.000]  done that to me and folks have stood up for me you know matt drudge came here and visited us last
[02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:53.720]  week uh they've said that i influenced the boss and bombers that i want cops killed everybody
[02:24:53.720 --> 02:24:57.480]  knows that's not true they're mad that i'm trying to stop the whole kill the cop movement
[02:24:58.120 --> 02:25:02.520]  and reform the police at the same time but jesse ventura saw you know in the news that he'd been
[02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:07.240]  arrested you know basically out or you know the police had gone after him in california at the
[02:25:07.240 --> 02:25:13.000]  airport he hadn't been flying for two years when that happened he was in minnesota had to come on
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:16.280]  the show and say i'm in minnesota then they came up with this thing when right when he went into
[02:25:16.280 --> 02:25:20.680]  mexico right when he drove in knowing he'd be out of contact for a few days in his rv that
[02:25:20.680 --> 02:25:25.480]  he'd been beat up and was glad that navy seals were dying that's how they assassinate character
[02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:30.600]  i mean they could come out and say i'm a child molester and people better not turn against me
[02:25:30.600 --> 02:25:35.800]  if they do something or i'm a drug dealer i'm i'm uh who knows what they'll make up it's just that
[02:25:35.800 --> 02:25:40.360]  i've already been through this and it's it's it's crazy that they can get away with it and now
[02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:46.440]  they're trying to overturn his case they've got 30 something of the biggest news corporations out there
[02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:54.600]  are paying to to fight ventura to overthrow his verdict by the judge by the jury to overthrow his
[02:25:54.600 --> 02:26:01.000]  verdict to allow them to have unjust enrichment so they make a hundred million dollars line about you
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:04.840]  and then you can fight them spend a million dollars win a million dollars but then they
[02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:09.320]  could make all the money because they're allowed to get enriched by it uh i mean that is dangerous
[02:26:09.320 --> 02:26:13.880]  i mean that means i could write a book about some famous person making stuff up make a bunch of money
[02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:17.800]  and all they can do is get me for defamation if i'm you know if they're lucky jessie i'm kind of
[02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:22.280]  taking the time here you know putting my argument out but that's why this is important this is bigger
[02:26:22.280 --> 02:26:31.240]  than jesse ventura said this this could turn it into a business for them to where they could defame
[02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:36.920]  anybody they won't have to do any type of do diligence to see if what they write is true
[02:26:36.920 --> 02:26:43.560]  and uh then they then they'll be allowed to profit from wrongdoing or to profit from lying
[02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:49.560]  and they're hiding behind the first amendment they're claiming that the first amendment is the
[02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:56.520]  reason that they should be allowed to do this but i've stated many times i support the first
[02:26:56.520 --> 02:27:01.160]  amendment and it's all about freedom of speech and it's there to protect bad speech not good
[02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:07.480]  speech because bad speech needs protection but that doesn't mean you can go in as the as the
[02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:14.760]  old cliche is into a crowded theater and yell fire and be protected be protected by the first amendment
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:21.720]  just as i don't believe it allows you to lie about somebody and profit from that lie you should not
[02:27:21.720 --> 02:27:27.480]  be protected by the first amendment from profiting from a lie and that's in essence what they want
[02:27:27.480 --> 02:27:34.040]  to do with my court case is make millions of dollars a profit from lying about me and then
[02:27:34.040 --> 02:27:39.720]  destroy my reputation and his book sold nothing the first two weeks till he went on open an
[02:27:39.720 --> 02:27:44.040]  anthony and then he went on fox news everywhere and said he beat you up and because you were saying
[02:27:44.040 --> 02:27:49.320]  your glad veterans are dead which was crafted to destroy you and make money at the same time
[02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:54.920]  yeah well he you're exactly right there the book had a presale of four thousand
[02:27:54.920 --> 02:28:01.320]  and he went on television and went on open anthony and o'reilly in that and a hundred thousand in
[02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:07.480]  one day it went from four thousand to a hundred thousand in one day and yet they're trying to
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:13.560]  state that it wasn't my story that did it it was the only thing they talked about and they went so
[02:28:13.560 --> 02:28:20.440]  far alex is doing this if you typed in jessie ventura or ventura on the internet it would
[02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:27.400]  automatically take you to the chris kyle lie it was premeditated i mean we could see the crafting
[02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:32.520]  of it and i just it i'm not scared of him killing me even or put me in prison but i'm scared of him
[02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:37.880]  destroying my name and my family being embarrassed if they just make crap up it's just incredible
[02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:44.200]  what they do yeah it really is they you know and like i said that's why and the update on it is
[02:28:44.200 --> 02:28:50.680]  we've got oral arguments in the eighth circuit court of appeals on october the 20th tuesday
[02:28:51.560 --> 02:28:56.600]  and that it should be shortly thereafter that they will rule one way or the other but oral
[02:28:56.600 --> 02:29:02.360]  arguments are october 20th in the eighth circuit court of appeals in st paul well this will change
[02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:07.160]  i know your lawyers told you this but i've seen in the news this will change defamation law and the
[02:29:07.160 --> 02:29:12.600]  court will be going against all previous precedent going back to english common law if they say you're
[02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:19.160]  allowed to be unrichly uh unjustly enriched i would think so i mean it's they're asking for a law
[02:29:19.160 --> 02:29:24.520]  to be gotten rid of they're asking the eighth circuit court of appeals to change the law
[02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:30.120]  that is out there and we feel confident my my attorneys are very good they're not big name
[02:29:30.120 --> 02:29:36.360]  attorneys as you call them but they're very very good and uh like they've told me we've met every
[02:29:36.360 --> 02:29:42.200]  constitutional requirement for unjust enrichment it's already been stay there stay there so if you
[02:29:42.200 --> 02:29:49.480]  don't win we know the fix is in absolutely it's a slam dunk we'll be back we're on the march the
[02:29:49.480 --> 02:30:01.400]  empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network hit daniels info wars dot com the college
[02:30:01.400 --> 02:30:06.120]  newspaper claimed that concealed carry is an example of white privilege you heard that right an
[02:30:06.120 --> 02:30:11.320]  article in a daily text in the campus newspaper of the university of texas at austin said quote
[02:30:11.320 --> 02:30:15.800]  based on the historical president of black people framed as dangerous the new gun policy
[02:30:15.800 --> 02:30:20.280]  which legalizes concealed carry on campus will endanger black students who choose to exercise
[02:30:20.280 --> 02:30:24.920]  their new rights but here's the ironic part the same article also pointed out the historic link

[02:34:10.120 --> 02:34:13.000]  I'm sure he's got a bunch of stuff he wants to talk about. I've been asking questions so far.
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:17.880]  The new book, American Conspiracies, goes back on sale. It's been updated. We're going to talk
[02:34:17.880 --> 02:34:22.120]  about the updates and buy such a good book to wake up friends and family here in just a moment,
[02:34:22.120 --> 02:34:29.080]  put out by Skyhors Publishing. But before I do that, we are not like MSNBC that got over,
[02:34:29.080 --> 02:34:33.480]  well, their parent company, $5 billion in bailout stimulus money, and then over a billion went to
[02:34:33.480 --> 02:34:41.640]  their news divisions, NBC and MSNBC. We don't get taxpayer money. We don't get $450 million a year
[02:34:41.640 --> 02:34:46.120]  like NPR who still begs for money on top of it. And it's funded by the Rockefeller Foundation for
[02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:52.600]  the GAP. We are funded by our sponsors and by the products we sell, mainly by the products we sell,

[02:35:14.360 --> 02:35:19.400]  tiny bit still gets through. You've got to like do reverse osmosis to cut out almost everything,
[02:35:19.400 --> 02:35:23.800]  and then that cuts out the good minerals. But I choose to use gravity-fed systems. This is the
[02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:29.560]  best, and it's very affordable. Blows away the competition. We have 20% off Prosteguard. We

[02:36:35.240 --> 02:36:39.800]  and thank you all for your support and for spreading the word about the broadcast. They have
[02:36:39.800 --> 02:36:45.240]  tried to delist us more on Google. Alexa's derated us and cut our ratings by half, along with every
[02:36:45.240 --> 02:36:52.040]  other libertarian Patreon site in the last year. They're doing a lot to try to suppress us. Facebook
[02:36:52.040 --> 02:36:57.640]  is blocking a lot of our big shares now. Zuckerberg admits they're doing that, not just to us, but
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:03.640]  media that isn't in line with the administration's agenda. And that leads me now to get into the
[02:37:03.640 --> 02:37:09.640]  book with Jesse Ventura. I hated Bush. I made films about government involvement in 9-11. Now
[02:37:09.640 --> 02:37:14.280]  we've been vindicated. That's come out the 28 pages. Bare minimum Saudi Arabia quarterbacking
[02:37:14.280 --> 02:37:20.200]  the U.S. standing down. I've had congressmen on that have seen it. Walter Jones, it's bombshell.
[02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:25.080]  So we've been vindicated. And the Democrats are involved as well. But with Obama,
[02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:33.640]  there's this left cover. So Libya, Syria, the attacks on free speech, the regulations,
[02:37:33.640 --> 02:37:38.120]  the arresting record amounts of whistleblowers and journalists. I've had Jonathan Turley on,
[02:37:38.120 --> 02:37:44.440]  Big Liberal, top constitutional lawyer. He says Obama is basically three times worse than Bush.
[02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:52.200]  I mean, the NDAA, all of it. I mean, it is so bad that he launched a big giant whopper like Iraq.
[02:37:52.200 --> 02:37:57.880]  No. So Bush is worse when it comes to overall death, but he did accelerate Afghanistan. So I'm
[02:37:57.880 --> 02:38:02.520]  ranting, Governor Ventura, what is your take on the legacy of Obama? And I know you don't like
[02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:08.760]  either party, but man, I tell you, I mean, we need to, he's the guy in power right now. He needs to
[02:38:08.760 --> 02:38:13.720]  have somebody put the brakes on him. What is your view on Obama, the legacy, the election, all of it?
[02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:21.880]  Well, first of all, the election, I'd like to state that I wish we would pass a law in the
[02:38:21.880 --> 02:38:28.200]  United States that you're not even allowed to form a campaign committee until the year the
[02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:36.360]  election is actually going to take place. In other words, you can't start running for 2016
[02:38:36.360 --> 02:38:44.120]  until the year 2016, because the way it looks right now, whoever the new president who takes
[02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:52.120]  office in January of 2017, I imagine the election will start at that point for whoever going to
[02:38:52.120 --> 02:38:58.440]  run in 2020. Sure. It's like Christmas ends the 26th and then the countdown to Christmas
[02:38:58.440 --> 02:39:02.600]  and Santa Claus and all the stuff just stays out all year long. Yeah, it just begins and the
[02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:09.960]  advertising continues all the way till the next election. Obama, he's been a great disappointment
[02:39:09.960 --> 02:39:15.880]  from what he ran on. He ran that he was going to end the wars while clearly the wars aren't
[02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:21.800]  ended. We're neck deep in him as deep as we've just about ever been and on more fronts than we've
[02:39:21.800 --> 02:39:27.160]  just about ever been. He said that he'd close Gitmo. Well, that hasn't happened either.
[02:39:28.520 --> 02:39:34.360]  He seems to be accomplishing most of what he wants to do since he's become a lame duck.
[02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:41.160]  And I find that quite astounding at how he's able to do things now that he couldn't do
[02:39:41.960 --> 02:39:46.200]  when he was up for election and now he can't get elected again because he's
[02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:51.800]  in his second term and as you know, our constitution doesn't allow the president to serve more than
[02:39:51.800 --> 02:39:59.560]  two terms. But I think the main thing I draw from Obama's this is the fact that whether it's a
[02:39:59.560 --> 02:40:06.760]  Republican or whether it's a Democrat, it makes no difference. That's the big key I think that
[02:40:06.760 --> 02:40:12.760]  people need to wake up to that with these two parties, it does not make any difference which
[02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:19.880]  one gets elected. The same foreign policy will be carried out and probably this pretty much the same
[02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:26.200]  domestic policy will be carried out regardless. Sure. Well, Obamacare was written by Nelson
[02:40:26.200 --> 02:40:32.600]  Rockefeller in the 50s. The Republican Party got it in in in in Massachusetts, as you know,
[02:40:32.600 --> 02:40:39.000]  it is a screw job for the insurance companies to increase prices, ration care, but sold as liberal
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:43.480]  people went for it. Well, if we put up with that screw job Jesse, Governor Ventura joining us,
[02:40:44.040 --> 02:40:47.800]  then the sky is the limit. I mean, now in Europe, they're talking about bail ins
[02:40:48.920 --> 02:40:54.120]  where where they're going to just take money out of your bank account directly to the banks
[02:40:54.120 --> 02:40:59.480]  to pay off national debt. So isn't that direct corporate fascism, world government where banks
[02:40:59.480 --> 02:41:06.680]  Yeah, I would tell you that I Mussolini, I think it'd be extremely proud of the United States today
[02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:13.240]  and the direction we're going. In your gut, do you think humanity will survive another 100 years?
[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:20.360]  I'd like to believe so. I really would. I'd like to believe that, you know, because there's always
[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:26.520]  been times in history where people probably felt the world was going to hell in a handbasket.
[02:41:27.240 --> 02:41:33.000]  But we've always managed to prevail the human spirit. And I still want to believe the human
[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:37.800]  spirit will prevail even through this mess we're in right now. But the only way that's going to
[02:41:37.800 --> 02:41:43.960]  happen, in my opinion, is we need a revolution in this country. And when I say revolution,
[02:41:43.960 --> 02:41:48.680]  it doesn't necessarily have to be a violent one. Although it could lead to that, you never know.
[02:41:49.400 --> 02:41:56.280]  But we certainly need a revolution at the ballot box. We have to stop electing these same people
[02:41:56.280 --> 02:42:02.440]  to the same jobs. And that's where I cheer about Donald Trump. That's where I cheer about Bernie
[02:42:02.440 --> 02:42:08.120]  Sanders, because they're stirring it up and they're helping to destroy the two-party monopoly,
[02:42:08.120 --> 02:42:14.120]  the two-party dictatorship that runs this country. Doesn't it show the arrogance of the
[02:42:14.120 --> 02:42:18.440]  political establishment that they would try to foist Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton to quote
[02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:23.720]  drudge, you know, basically two brains in a jar? I mean, these political corrupt dynasties, what a
[02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:30.360]  joke. Well, the whole thing is they're all part of the same power team. They're all part of the
[02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:35.800]  same faction that's had the power. I mean, face it, these parties have been really unchallenged
[02:42:35.800 --> 02:42:42.600]  other than when Perot came up a little bit in 1990 and scared them. And then they sent Pat Buchanan
[02:42:42.600 --> 02:42:48.440]  and his legions into the reform party and destroyed our party. Well, now they're getting a taste of
[02:42:48.440 --> 02:42:53.960]  their own medicine. Remember, Donald Trump was with us at the reform party back then. Maybe
[02:42:53.960 --> 02:42:59.320]  Donald's just giving them a taste of their own medicine. Well, I know you're friends with Donald
[02:42:59.320 --> 02:43:03.960]  Trump. So let me ask you this question, noting for 20 plus years, do you think he's for real or
[02:43:03.960 --> 02:43:10.040]  is this a publicity stunt? Oh, it's for real now. I thought at first it might be a publicity stunt
[02:43:10.040 --> 02:43:16.520]  initially because Donald has always threatened to run. And then when push came to shove, he didn't do
[02:43:16.520 --> 02:43:23.000]  it. But for him to do what he's done within the Republican party, he's all in. He's all in now.
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:29.880]  And he's all in because his poll numbers are allowing him to stay in. As he stated, if his
[02:43:29.880 --> 02:43:35.720]  poll numbers drop to single digits, Donald's smart enough to get out. That would be the writing on
[02:43:35.720 --> 02:43:42.280]  the wall for you. Well, the people aren't buying my program. But as long as Trump remains the leader
[02:43:42.920 --> 02:43:49.320]  or up close to being the leader, I think he's in for the long haul now. But will he get by the
[02:43:49.320 --> 02:43:55.240]  convention? Personally, I think it ends at the Republican convention, no matter what he does,
[02:43:55.240 --> 02:44:01.160]  as will the same will happen to Bernie Sanders. The Washington Post came out with a big article
[02:44:01.160 --> 02:44:06.680]  comparing Trump to me, what I did in Minnesota, what Trump's doing now. But they forgot to
[02:44:06.680 --> 02:44:13.160]  compare me to Bernie Sanders too, because what's happening to Bernie is identical to what happened
[02:44:13.160 --> 02:44:20.200]  to me. The media ignores Bernie, but everywhere he goes, there's 20 to 25,000 people there to hear
[02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:25.560]  him. My problem with Sanders is... That's the way it was for me, Alex. And I'm not saying Bernie's
[02:44:25.560 --> 02:44:30.280]  the answer, but I'm just saying... No, I get it. He's an indicator of people are upset. No, I totally
[02:44:30.280 --> 02:44:34.520]  get what you're saying. Here's my problem. He's anti-gun. I mean, could you talk to Bernie or
[02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:39.480]  somebody and say, look, good guys with guns aren't the problem. We don't need to ban semi-autos.
[02:44:39.480 --> 02:44:47.000]  We'll work on Bernie. We'll work on him. Remember this. We still have the Second Amendment until
[02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:54.200]  they repeal the Second Amendment. We can keep our guns. But they are trying to get them. Are you
[02:44:54.200 --> 02:44:59.560]  concerned if they really try to ban guns that can start a civil war? Well, here's what I'm concerned
[02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:05.320]  about more than that. I'm concerned about the hypocrisy of it, Alex. They're out there talking
[02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:09.960]  about these school shootings. They're out there talking about all the bad things that happen
[02:45:09.960 --> 02:45:17.080]  with guns. And certainly, there are. No one can deny that. Humans misuse guns. It's a known fact
[02:45:17.080 --> 02:45:24.040]  we do it. But here's where I come from. When they come to me and tell me they're going to take my
[02:45:24.040 --> 02:45:30.440]  gun away, I think it's hypocrisy. When the United States of America, the government itself is the
[02:45:30.440 --> 02:45:36.920]  biggest arms dealer in the world. Of course. What is the difference if a child gets killed overseas
[02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:42.680]  or one gets killed in America? Is there a value difference between those two children? Not to
[02:45:42.680 --> 02:45:49.640]  me there isn't. A child is a child no matter where they're at. And our weapons are killing people
[02:45:49.640 --> 02:45:56.120]  that we sell internationally to all these thugs and governments and what have you throughout the
[02:45:56.120 --> 02:46:03.480]  world. So let the US government lead the way. When they come to me and say, Jesse Ventura,
[02:46:03.480 --> 02:46:10.680]  we've stopped selling guns throughout the whole world now. At that point in time, maybe I might
[02:46:10.680 --> 02:46:18.840]  listen a little. But until that happens, Jesse Ventura ain't listening until they not only talk
[02:46:18.840 --> 02:46:24.440]  to talk, our government's got to start walking the walk on guns. Bravo to that. And that's exactly
[02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:27.880]  what Ice Cube said and got demonized a few years ago. He said, I tell you what, when the government
[02:46:27.880 --> 02:46:31.960]  turns theirs in, I'll turn mine in. When all these rich people with their bodyguards, I couldn't
[02:46:31.960 --> 02:46:36.280]  believe it. It was an AP, AFP everywhere criticized Donald Trump this weekend when they found that
[02:46:36.280 --> 02:46:41.080]  he had a concealed permit for 20 years. And he said, yeah, I carry a gun sometimes. He's got
[02:46:41.080 --> 02:46:47.160]  cartels after him. He's rich, a kidnapping target. But the general public should be able to
[02:46:47.160 --> 02:46:51.560]  protect themselves. But the media thinks Donald Trump shouldn't be able to have a gun. I mean,
[02:46:51.560 --> 02:46:56.920]  who can have a gun if he can't? Well, let me give you how bad it was in Minnesota.
[02:46:57.560 --> 02:47:04.200]  In Minnesota, conceal and carry, I helped change the law to where it shall issue if you're qualified.
[02:47:04.840 --> 02:47:10.200]  I was the mayor of Brooklyn Park, and I went to my police chief to get concealed and carry,
[02:47:10.200 --> 02:47:16.920]  and he turned me down. Now, can you imagine, but I got my revenge on him. He later was made head
[02:47:16.920 --> 02:47:22.760]  of public safety in the state of Minnesota under Arnie Carlson. When I came into office, of course,
[02:47:22.760 --> 02:47:27.640]  I named my own commissioners. I looked at him and smiled, and I said, you shouldn't have turned
[02:47:27.640 --> 02:47:33.160]  down my conceal and carry chief, you're out of here. Good. What a, how could you look at a mayor
[02:47:33.160 --> 02:47:39.000]  and not let him have a gun? I don't know. All I wanted to conceal and carry. And in those days,
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:43.880]  in Minnesota, police chiefs could turn down, it was all in their hands. Oh, I remember that. Yeah,
[02:47:43.880 --> 02:47:48.360]  it was all the time. So we had all the people in northern Minnesota up in the woods could get
[02:47:48.360 --> 02:47:53.960]  concealed and carry like nothing. But if you were down in the urban centers of the Twin Cities,
[02:47:53.960 --> 02:48:01.080]  you couldn't get one no matter who you bribed. Unbelievable. It's just sick.
[02:48:01.080 --> 02:48:06.680]  But that's changed now, Alex. It happened with me, and then Governor Palenti continued on with it.
[02:48:06.680 --> 02:48:09.800]  Now, I know you did that. You've been pro-gun. We love it.
[02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:14.840]  We changed it to shell issue. If you're caught, but we made it stringent. You have to pass a
[02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:20.840]  background check. You have to take a gun training course, and you have to take target and shoot a
[02:48:20.840 --> 02:48:25.800]  minimum score. Because I don't want people carrying guns that don't know what the hell they're doing
[02:48:25.800 --> 02:48:31.080]  with them. Let's go ahead now and go to a few calls for Governor Jesse Ventura. And a couple
[02:48:31.080 --> 02:48:34.520]  of weeks, we're about to officially launch the satellite stuff. I'm not able to skip breaks
[02:48:34.520 --> 02:48:38.200]  ever again because of TV, but we can skip this one for Jesse because I want to have as much time
[02:48:38.200 --> 02:48:42.600]  as we can. I've been hogging him as usual, not going to calls. Let's go to Matthew,
[02:48:43.560 --> 02:48:47.480]  who is calling from... It doesn't say where he's calling from. He's calling from deep space.
[02:48:48.200 --> 02:48:50.520]  So, Matthew, you're on the air with Jesse Ventura. Go ahead.
[02:48:53.480 --> 02:48:55.720]  Very exciting call. Mr. Ventura. Yeah, go ahead, Matthew.
[02:48:55.720 --> 02:48:56.520]  Yes, Matthew.
[02:48:58.600 --> 02:49:03.080]  I'm coming from the former Republic of Tennessee. What FEMA region is that?
[02:49:03.080 --> 02:49:04.840]  I guess that'd be six or five. Go ahead.
[02:49:04.840 --> 02:49:10.440]  I'm calling from FEMA region six. Hail to you, Mr. Ventura. I understand you're from
[02:49:10.440 --> 02:49:17.480]  the men's department of the Navy. I'm from the men's department of the Navy? No, I wasn't a Marine.
[02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:23.640]  That's what the Marines used to always say. They'd always say, yeah, we're part of the
[02:49:23.640 --> 02:49:31.720]  Navy, the men's department. I'm not a Marine. I'm a fraud man. Always remember. Wait, always
[02:49:31.720 --> 02:49:36.840]  remember. The Marines claim they're first to shore, but UDT's been there before.
[02:49:37.720 --> 02:49:39.880]  That's right. Okay, go ahead, Colin.
[02:49:41.160 --> 02:49:47.800]  Okay, so speaking of how people obfuscate things mathematically, right, I've heard you mention
[02:49:48.600 --> 02:49:54.040]  similarities between Horace and Jesus. And one of the big reasons why, you know, this is so
[02:49:54.040 --> 02:49:58.600]  important to a lot of people is because there's something called the George Washington Retirement
[02:49:58.600 --> 02:50:03.960]  Plan. No retirement at all. People seeing it up, doing the right thing, even when they're tired,
[02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:10.840]  even when they're 54 years old. So speaking of the mathematical similarity between Jesus and Horace,
[02:50:10.840 --> 02:50:17.240]  I'm going to cite a book, Gerald Massey, The Natural Genesis, from 1883. So let's say you've
[02:50:17.240 --> 02:50:24.760]  got 200 independent events that Gerald Massey has identified as being similar between Jesus and Horace.
[02:50:24.760 --> 02:50:31.800]  That would be 0.5 to the 200th. That comes out 6.22 times 10 to the negative 21.
[02:50:31.800 --> 02:50:37.880]  Now, there are 400 prophecies fulfilled with Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ's death was not a
[02:50:37.880 --> 02:50:42.600]  victimization thing. It was an achievement. So that was... All right, listen, I'm going to jump
[02:50:42.600 --> 02:50:45.160]  here. I'm going to jump as I want to get to the caller, so I'm going to get... Just to believe
[02:50:45.160 --> 02:50:51.320]  all that. I'm sorry, but I don't. Well, I'm not getting a fight with a caller, and I don't screen
[02:50:51.320 --> 02:50:55.880]  the call, so that makes them interesting in wall cards, but... I guess he's doing that,
[02:50:55.880 --> 02:51:02.440]  trying to win me over from my atheist position. Well, I'm not sure quite what he was doing, but
[02:51:03.640 --> 02:51:09.720]  my big issue here... Don't get me wrong. I'm not anti-religion. People believe in anything you want.
[02:51:09.720 --> 02:51:15.480]  That's part of freedom. Let's go ahead now and take another call. These callers are all over the
[02:51:15.480 --> 02:51:22.840]  map for Jesse Ventura. How do you say that? Jera? In California, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:51:24.760 --> 02:51:28.200]  You can just call me an Info Warrior Princess for short.
[02:51:28.200 --> 02:51:30.040]  Okay, Info Warrior Princess. Go ahead.
[02:51:31.320 --> 02:51:39.320]  We flagged my resume. I'm a thousand percent prepared to serve anyone. I'm energized by all
[02:51:39.320 --> 02:51:46.680]  of your nutraceuticals and anyone not experiencing. Your product is missing out on the true essence
[02:51:46.680 --> 02:51:56.840]  of a vibrant life. Jesse and Alex, we don't need a drop of oil. Camp can fuel the world. Camp is
[02:51:56.840 --> 02:52:05.000]  mana from God. Camp will end the wars and heal the planet. Camp is a solution to creating
[02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:13.400]  cottage industries stamped, made in America. Camp is no pestilence. It grows with little water
[02:52:13.400 --> 02:52:21.320]  and neutralizes the soil. It burns hot and slow. It creates no pollution. Camp is world peace.
[02:52:21.320 --> 02:52:24.200]  Well, let me get Ventura's take on what you're bringing up, and I appreciate your call.
[02:52:25.160 --> 02:52:29.880]  Absolutely. Like 18 states have legalized it. That's marijuana, not just him. And still the
[02:52:29.880 --> 02:52:36.440]  feds won't back off. But yeah, the whole story, you've talked about that, how they banned hemp.
[02:52:36.440 --> 02:52:40.920]  So the cotton industry and also polyester can take over. What would you do as president with
[02:52:40.920 --> 02:52:45.720]  the drug laws, Jesse? Actually, it was William Randolph Hearst that got it banned because he
[02:52:45.720 --> 02:52:51.080]  owned thousands of acres of timber land. That's right. And he wanted to force us to use the timber
[02:52:51.080 --> 02:52:57.320]  to make paper rather than him. No, the caller's precisely, I won't quite take it to the limit
[02:52:57.320 --> 02:53:03.400]  she did, that it's the savior of the world. But hemp is a wonderful, hemp and marijuana
[02:53:03.400 --> 02:53:09.480]  is a wonderful product. God made it if you believe in God, right? And it has so many,
[02:53:09.480 --> 02:53:15.560]  it's a medical plant. It has so many uses from clothing to energy. Willie Nelson burns it
[02:53:15.560 --> 02:53:25.400]  in his biodiesel buses, not just in his pipe. And for us to eradicate it for 75 years is criminal
[02:53:25.400 --> 02:53:31.560]  and it's high time. If you want to become energy independent, then legalize hemp and marijuana
[02:53:31.560 --> 02:53:36.200]  through the entire United States of America and get it off. It should be left up to the
[02:53:36.200 --> 02:53:41.800]  states anyway. That's what we do with drinking and alcohol. It's left up to the states.
[02:53:41.800 --> 02:53:46.440]  This should be left, marijuana should be left up to the states also. Well, there's no doubt that
[02:53:47.080 --> 02:53:52.040]  alcohol is a lot worse than marijuana and people do abuse it. What I don't like is people either
[02:53:52.040 --> 02:53:57.000]  worship it or they hate it. And it has a lot of benefits. It has some problems when it's abused,
[02:53:57.000 --> 02:54:02.120]  anything does. And it's just, you shouldn't be putting people in prison for marijuana. I mean,
[02:54:02.120 --> 02:54:07.960]  that's so... Well, let me finish with a quote I always like to give Alex. Marijuana used to rock
[02:54:07.960 --> 02:54:14.840]  and roll. What beer is the baseball? Absolutely, it certainly is. We've got callers all over the
[02:54:14.840 --> 02:54:18.680]  map here. Let's go to Sherri in Texas. Once you talk to Jesse Ventura, Sherri, go ahead.
[02:54:18.680 --> 02:54:25.240]  Oh, thank you, Jesse Ventura. I love when you're the guest. I wouldn't miss it for the world.
[02:54:25.240 --> 02:54:29.000]  I have a question. I kind of grew for you Sanders, but it's only because we're not
[02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:36.520]  on an equal footing with the rest of Europe. They ban all these psychotrophics. And my question is,
[02:54:36.520 --> 02:54:42.600]  see, what do you think? How do we know who's going to be prescribed these drugs? They trigger
[02:54:42.600 --> 02:54:47.720]  alcohol consumption, which can lead to this manic behavior. And then what happens if there's a
[02:54:47.720 --> 02:54:53.160]  transportation or communication breakdown and they can't get these drugs? That creates the worst
[02:54:53.160 --> 02:55:05.640]  reaction of all. And they have as a side effect, suicide. So whatever percentage of suicide is
[02:55:05.640 --> 02:55:11.240]  the problem, that's the psychotropic drugs, not the guns. Well, sure, the insert says it can make
[02:55:11.240 --> 02:55:16.040]  you kill yourself or go psychotic. I appreciate your call, Governor Ventura. What is your view on
[02:55:16.040 --> 02:55:24.440]  SSRIs? Well, what's SSRIs, Alex? Saraton and Riepp Degenhebner. You know, Prozac.
[02:55:25.160 --> 02:55:29.960]  Oh, all of that stuff? Well, you know, they stick it in our water.
[02:55:31.240 --> 02:55:36.200]  You're right. Fluoride is the base of it. Fluoride's the base of Prozac, and they put it in the water
[02:55:36.200 --> 02:55:43.160]  to dumb you down. I've always been a believer that, unfortunately, our medical system today
[02:55:43.160 --> 02:55:49.640]  is controlled by pharma. And pharma also controls our media and television. Take a look in the
[02:55:49.640 --> 02:55:57.480]  afternoon on how many ads are pharmaceutical ads on television. Pharma controls television,
[02:55:57.480 --> 02:56:06.280]  mainstream television, and the point being is pharma, yes, they can do some great things with
[02:56:06.280 --> 02:56:14.600]  drugs, but they also, to every drug, there's a ying and a yang. There's a positive it can do,
[02:56:14.600 --> 02:56:20.360]  and there's always a negative side to any type of drug usage. You have to weigh those consequences,
[02:56:20.360 --> 02:56:26.920]  and there's a lot of other forms of healing out there rather than pharmaceutical. Exactly.
[02:56:26.920 --> 02:56:31.240]  Whether it's vaccines or SSRIs, they just want to act like there's no problems,
[02:56:31.240 --> 02:56:34.280]  and then we shouldn't have a debate about it, and just it's all safe and effective,
[02:56:34.280 --> 02:56:38.280]  and it's not. Let's go ahead and take another call. We're going to talk about the book briefly
[02:56:38.280 --> 02:56:41.160]  and let the governor get out of here in the fourth hour. It's coming up with Rob Dew.
[02:56:42.040 --> 02:56:47.640]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Jason in Minnesota. You're on the air with Ventura.
[02:56:50.200 --> 02:56:57.640]  Oh, yes, Jason. Go ahead. Hey, I just see I wanted to talk to you for a while.
[02:56:57.640 --> 02:57:05.160]  Well, apparently for my family, I heard you worked with my dad when you were a bouncer at a bar.
[02:57:05.160 --> 02:57:13.720]  My dad was James Gunter Horn. Did you know Jimmy? I'm not sure because I bounced at a number of
[02:57:13.720 --> 02:57:17.800]  bars, and it's so many years ago, I can't even remember the names of the bars.
[02:57:19.160 --> 02:57:23.400]  I see you do that ad for a liquor store, though, with the keg under your arm. That's funny.
[02:57:23.400 --> 02:57:31.240]  That was way back red. I wish I could say that I did, but again, I worked at a lot of bars because
[02:57:31.240 --> 02:57:38.440]  when you're at that age and you're big and you're powerful and strong, it's an easy way to make
[02:57:38.440 --> 02:57:43.480]  a living, but it's a way to make a living. Jason, we got a minute left with Ventura. He
[02:57:43.480 --> 02:57:47.320]  wanted to know about TPP. They signed that last week. We still can't read it, Jesse.
[02:57:47.320 --> 02:57:53.320]  What? The Trans-Pacific Partnership. They signed it last week, but we still can't see it.
[02:57:54.920 --> 02:57:59.080]  What, did they put it under national security? Yeah, they just won't let Congress see it.
[02:57:59.080 --> 02:58:03.720]  Won't anybody see it? It's just incredible. We ought to do a whole show on that. Briefly,
[02:58:03.720 --> 02:58:07.160]  what are some of the new chapters added to the book, American Conspiracies?
[02:58:07.160 --> 02:58:13.640]  Well, we cover, of course, we cover the GMOs and how they're poisoning all our food and
[02:58:13.640 --> 02:58:22.040]  the rate of danger from it and who's the big company again, Alex? Can't think of them right now.
[02:58:22.040 --> 02:58:30.680]  Monsanto? Monsanto. How Monsanto pays off the politicians with donations and then the politicians
[02:58:30.680 --> 02:58:37.160]  name Monsanto people to the FDA. You know Monsanto has never been turned down by you.
[02:58:37.160 --> 02:58:41.080]  We're out of time. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. American Conspiracies available now.
[02:58:41.080 --> 02:58:44.840]  Fourth hour coming up with Rob. Dude, he'll cover current mind control and more.
[02:58:51.720 --> 02:58:56.680]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[02:58:56.680 --> 02:59:01.400]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:59:01.400 --> 02:59:06.680]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control. Television, music, fast food, GMOs,
[02:59:06.680 --> 02:59:11.240]  sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being
[02:59:11.240 --> 02:59:17.000]  hammered daily by globalist concoctions. It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then
[02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:22.120]  are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs. Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula
[02:59:22.120 --> 02:59:26.280]  with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take. We worked with the
[02:59:26.280 --> 02:59:30.600]  leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most
[02:59:30.600 --> 02:59:36.120]  affordable and powerful calming formula out there, introducing child ease with herbs and calming
[02:59:36.120 --> 02:59:41.480]  extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great. Obtain
[02:59:41.480 --> 02:59:48.040]  your child ease today at infowarslife.com. That's child ease exclusively at infowarslife.com.
[02:59:51.080 --> 02:59:53.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:53.720 --> 03:00:07.720]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:07.720 --> 03:00:10.840]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:00:19.320 --> 03:00:23.000]  All right, we are live in the fourth hour. This is the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:27.320]  I'm your host Rob Dew, sitting in. We have a rotating cast here
[03:00:28.440 --> 03:00:33.000]  infowars.com with the fourth hour. If your radio station is not carrying the fourth hour and you're
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:37.880]  listening to this on YouTube or on our podcast, then please call your radio station and tell them
[03:00:37.880 --> 03:00:41.960]  to start carrying the fourth hour because we are doing it live every day just like the regular
[03:00:41.960 --> 03:00:46.120]  three hour Alex Jones show. I'm going to be getting into a lot of stuff. We're going to start off with
[03:00:46.120 --> 03:00:52.120]  a video here in a second, but I'm going to talk about this whole mindset that we've conditioned
[03:00:52.120 --> 03:00:56.200]  our children to be in this brainwashing about how we're controlling the language. Certain
[03:00:56.200 --> 03:01:02.200]  shirts aren't allowed while other shirts are allowed and promoted. Just all this madness,
[03:01:02.200 --> 03:01:08.120]  trying to keep kids in this narrow framework and what that leads to, what that leads to is a lot
[03:01:08.120 --> 03:01:12.760]  of suicides. I mean, you can go on any, any kid who's been, you see these suicides of kids who
[03:01:12.760 --> 03:01:18.360]  are cyber bullied and they can't take it and they kill themselves. That's because of what we do to
[03:01:18.360 --> 03:01:24.600]  our kids. It's because kids get a medal for participation and that's where it starts and
[03:01:24.600 --> 03:01:30.120]  what it leads to is no one being able to accept failure or loss. And that's a problem. My kids
[03:01:30.120 --> 03:01:35.880]  are in sports right now and it's funny watching the kids who lose how they react. Some of them
[03:01:35.880 --> 03:01:40.120]  are able to react very well and some of them just can't take losing. So let's go to this.
[03:01:40.920 --> 03:01:44.760]  What's losing right now is what's going on with the police. The police are trying,
[03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:49.160]  the feds are trying to take over the police forces and if that happens, you think you have
[03:01:49.160 --> 03:01:53.160]  racism now, you think you have killings now, it's going to be non-stop because federal agents think
[03:01:53.160 --> 03:01:58.120]  they are above the law 10 times over. So let's go to this John Bown report. We put it up over the
[03:01:58.120 --> 03:02:02.200]  weekend. Strong Cities Network is the new world order global police and we'll be back with more.
[03:02:02.200 --> 03:02:03.240]  This is Rob Dew with Overdrive.
[03:02:09.240 --> 03:02:13.960]  Who needs that old archaic constitution and annoying Congress when you can tour the world
[03:02:13.960 --> 03:02:19.160]  on the taxpayer's dime and trample their rights in the process, right? Attorney General Loretta
[03:02:19.160 --> 03:02:24.120]  Lynch? No one except your band of cohorts were impressed when you went after a meaningless
[03:02:24.120 --> 03:02:29.880]  game as you tackled FIFA instead of throwing the bankers laundering the drug cartels billions
[03:02:29.880 --> 03:02:35.720]  under the jail, kicking the proverbial soccer ball down the road. Rather than present her case
[03:02:35.720 --> 03:02:40.680]  to the American people from any number of American establishments, Attorney General Lynch
[03:02:40.680 --> 03:02:46.280]  basking in new world order arrogance bypassed the American people, bringing together a vile
[03:02:46.280 --> 03:02:51.720]  congregation to the Islamic High Council, the United Nations. Speakers included the diligent
[03:02:51.720 --> 03:02:58.040]  socialist mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, who expressed the ominous extremism doesn't discriminate,
[03:02:58.040 --> 03:03:03.880]  it comes in many forms, it comes in many different backgrounds and ideologies. Our mission should
[03:03:03.880 --> 03:03:10.760]  be to address extremism in all of its forms, and Jordan's High Commissioner for Human Rights,
[03:03:10.760 --> 03:03:17.000]  Prince Zaid Raad al-Hussein, a human rights council that just made the xenophobic and brutal
[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:22.600]  nation of Saudi Arabia a member. Writing for Breitbart, Pamela Geller explained,
[03:03:22.600 --> 03:03:28.680]  the United Nations is a Sharia compliant world body, and Obama, speaking there just days ago,
[03:03:28.680 --> 03:03:36.200]  insisted that violent extremism is not exclusive to Islam, which it is. Obama is redefining Jihad
[03:03:36.200 --> 03:03:43.240]  terror to include everyone but the Jihadists. So will the UN, driven largely by Sharia enforcing
[03:03:43.240 --> 03:03:49.640]  Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the OIC, and the pro-Islamic post-American President Obama,
[03:03:49.640 --> 03:03:56.360]  use a global police force to crush counter Jihad forces? This global police force was dreamed
[03:03:56.360 --> 03:04:01.640]  up by professors in the halls of Oxford and spearheaded by the New World Order think tank,
[03:04:01.640 --> 03:04:09.080]  the Institute of Strategic Dialogue, now launched as of September 29, 2015 by our Traders Government.
[03:04:09.080 --> 03:04:14.440]  It is described on the Strong Cities Network website as a global network of local authorities
[03:04:14.440 --> 03:04:20.200]  united in building resilience to prevent violent extremism. An international steering committee
[03:04:20.200 --> 03:04:25.720]  of cities and local authorities selected from different regions across the globe. Of course,
[03:04:25.720 --> 03:04:29.960]  Muslim Americans are complaining they will be targeted. And you can watch the rest of that
[03:04:29.960 --> 03:04:35.000]  report by going to the article Special Report Strong Cities Network Euphemism for New World Order
[03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:40.040]  Global Police Force. Now I've got some exclusive audio that I recorded with the pediatricians
[03:04:40.040 --> 03:04:43.320]  trying, three different pediatricians trying to convince me and my family to get that vitamin
[03:04:43.320 --> 03:04:58.360]  K shot. So stay tuned. There's a whole lot more. It's the Overdrive Hour. This is Rob Doome sitting in at the host chair. Thanks for watching.
[03:05:13.560 --> 03:05:19.320]  and risk sexual behavior. In comparison, there were 36,000 gun related deaths, including suicides
[03:05:19.320 --> 03:05:24.840]  and accidents in the US in 2013. And as a percentage of all causes of the death, alcohol related deaths
[03:05:24.840 --> 03:05:29.240]  are over twice as common as deaths involving firearms. Even more interesting, one third of gun
[03:05:29.240 --> 03:05:33.720]  deaths are alcohol related. So according to gun control logic, we could eliminate one third
[03:05:33.720 --> 03:05:38.120]  of gun related deaths overnight by banning alcohol. Yet you'll notice that mom's maned action and
[03:05:38.120 --> 03:05:42.280]  other Bloomberg backed groups aren't demanding we ban booze and beer. That's because the true
[03:05:42.280 --> 03:05:46.120]  agenda behind gun control is to control the population because the government can only
[03:05:46.120 --> 03:05:49.320]  expand at the expense of individual rights, such as the Second Amendment.
[03:05:49.320 --> 03:05:53.160]  Rodney MacKin of the Mises Institute wrote an excellent article breaking all of this down,
[03:05:53.160 --> 03:05:58.280]  including the statistics I cited. So check it out at infowars.com. And once again, this is Kit Daniels.

[03:06:58.040 --> 03:07:04.360]  Many of the products at infowarslife.com are true game changers. They are compounds that in many
[03:07:04.360 --> 03:07:08.360]  areas of the world are actually sold by prescription. But when we look at a product like survival
[03:07:08.360 --> 03:07:13.320]  shield nascent iodine x2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a
[03:07:13.320 --> 03:07:18.680]  hundred years. The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine accrued form
[03:07:18.680 --> 03:07:23.480]  of it be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency
[03:07:23.480 --> 03:07:28.200]  in iodine was causing. I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried x2 for yourselves.
[03:07:28.200 --> 03:07:32.360]  What do you have to lose? You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're
[03:07:32.360 --> 03:07:37.160]  getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives
[03:07:37.160 --> 03:07:41.640]  that I know. And the final reason to try x2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock. We ordered the
[03:07:41.640 --> 03:07:46.440]  biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out. It may be a month or two
[03:07:46.440 --> 03:07:51.000]  until more comes in. I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on survival
[03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:57.560]  shield x2 today at infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:07:57.560 --> 03:08:07.960]  From his central Texas command center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:07.960 --> 03:08:11.080]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:08:16.360 --> 03:08:19.480]  We are live here until 3 p.m. central and then we're back
[03:08:20.360 --> 03:08:26.280]  7 p.m. to 8 p.m. central with the info wars nightly news. This is Rob Dew hosting the fourth
[03:08:26.280 --> 03:08:29.960]  hour of overdrive. I've got three callers on the line and I'm going to go to you guys in the
[03:08:29.960 --> 03:08:36.440]  next segment. I got Doug, Herbert, or A-Bear as we used to say in Louisiana and Ivan. We're going
[03:08:36.440 --> 03:08:40.040]  to get to you guys in the next segment. I want to go through a series of videos that kind of
[03:08:40.040 --> 03:08:45.240]  illustrates the mindset that we're dealing with where people are totally uneducated about reality.
[03:08:45.240 --> 03:08:49.320]  And I'm going to contrast that with some video of people who are in the real world and using logic.
[03:08:49.320 --> 03:08:53.960]  But I want to go over this article first. This is from Kit Daniels. School suspends student
[03:08:53.960 --> 03:08:59.800]  over pro veteran t-shirt. School officials at Dexter McCarty Middle School in Gresham, Oregon
[03:08:59.800 --> 03:09:03.960]  demanded Allen Holmes change his shirt, which featured a battlefield cross consisting of a
[03:09:03.960 --> 03:09:09.000]  soldier's rifle stuck onto a bare boots with a helmet on top to show respect for soldiers killed
[03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:14.280]  in action. Obviously very racist. Look at that horrible t-shirt. You can see the t-shirt right
[03:09:14.280 --> 03:09:20.440]  there and the school didn't like that. Didn't even have a Confederate flag on it. Boy, they
[03:09:20.440 --> 03:09:23.800]  didn't like that at all. They won't let me wear a shirt that supports the people that keep us free.
[03:09:24.440 --> 03:09:28.680]  I'm not going to support them. Holmes told Fox 12, I was nervous and kind of heartbroken because I
[03:09:28.680 --> 03:09:34.520]  feel I should be able to support the troops that have died for us. Well, you know, in some ways,
[03:09:34.520 --> 03:09:39.080]  Allen, you're right. But in other ways, a lot of these troops are going and dying for giant
[03:09:39.080 --> 03:09:43.160]  corporations and multinational corporations in the wars. They want us to fight. We're not
[03:09:43.160 --> 03:09:47.480]  actually defending ourselves from an enemy who is invading us, which is why we were supposed to
[03:09:47.480 --> 03:09:52.200]  have armies and we were never supposed to have a standing army. That was supposed to be the domestic
[03:09:52.920 --> 03:09:57.640]  area. It was supposed to be guarded by militias. And a lot of people understand that in Oregon.
[03:09:58.200 --> 03:10:04.840]  He come to UT and nobody understands that. We had a gun control rally that happened recently
[03:10:04.840 --> 03:10:09.880]  in UT and we did some interviews out there. And I want to play this one. This is called
[03:10:09.880 --> 03:10:15.640]  gun control advocates get owned at their own rally and just listen to the logic that people use
[03:10:15.640 --> 03:10:20.440]  to defend the position of getting rid of guns and having gun free zones. Let's roll that report.
[03:10:21.480 --> 03:10:27.800]  The students here that are all very liberal and they mean well, but unfortunately they've been
[03:10:27.800 --> 03:10:35.400]  misinformed by their professors and by the media that the thing to do is to make the entire campus
[03:10:36.440 --> 03:10:41.560]  gun free. So when I first got here, I said, okay, where's my free gun? And all they did was laugh.
[03:10:41.560 --> 03:10:45.960]  I said, yeah, gun free doesn't mean anything. But when we say that we want gun free campuses for
[03:10:45.960 --> 03:10:52.040]  the aspect of educational purposes and security of our students, I believe that as well should be
[03:10:52.040 --> 03:10:56.440]  your specialty. But if you're saying that being a gun friend of campus security students, I can't
[03:10:56.440 --> 03:11:00.120]  seem to say that taking guns from everybody's security for the population. Because that's a
[03:11:00.120 --> 03:11:04.840]  hard to do. That's a generalization. That's a generalization you just made. That's a way
[03:11:04.840 --> 03:11:08.360]  bigger generalization you can think of. So it's okay like generalization as long as small. Where
[03:11:08.360 --> 03:11:16.200]  do you draw your line? That's a great point. You want to use like it says on the back of your
[03:11:16.200 --> 03:11:22.280]  shirt. Protect myself with reason. Okay, here comes a criminal. Oh, hey, let me reason with you.
[03:11:22.760 --> 03:11:27.400]  Don't shoot me. Don't take my money. Don't break my daughter. I'm going to use reason to stop you.
[03:11:27.400 --> 03:11:32.840]  And he's going to go, you stupid. Boom, shoot your, rape your wife, kill your children, take
[03:11:32.840 --> 03:11:37.000]  all your goods and run out the door. Let's have a conversation where you don't
[03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:48.440]  Okay, I'll try that. I'll try that. I promise I'll try that. I apologize for the language.
[03:11:48.440 --> 03:11:54.520]  Because if I get upset, it doesn't make sense. I understand, but that doesn't help anybody in any
[03:11:54.520 --> 03:11:58.520]  given situation to come to the middle ground because it's not going to be this extreme right
[03:11:58.520 --> 03:12:02.520]  or extreme left that's going to win. It's going to be able to come together. I don't care. I'm not about
[03:12:02.520 --> 03:12:07.480]  right and left. I don't understand about Democrats and Republicans. They're all I'm not I'm not talking
[03:12:07.480 --> 03:12:13.720]  about ABCs, all the media, all the media is wide to us. And I'm not talking about I'm not talking
[03:12:13.720 --> 03:12:17.560]  about Republicans and Democrats. You go to these schools and these classrooms. That's all they do
[03:12:17.560 --> 03:12:22.040]  here is put propaganda in your head. They're opinions, different professors opinions. You have
[03:12:22.040 --> 03:12:26.760]  citizens in the country that are different, that probably would have different sets of regulations
[03:12:26.760 --> 03:12:31.480]  out of way better, which is why the Second Amendment is a general right. We're not taking that away.
[03:12:31.480 --> 03:12:33.480]  We're taking it away. You're taking it away by infringing on it.
[03:12:33.480 --> 03:12:38.520]  There's going to be an issue in some locations. Yeah, so you're taking away a right. Let's just get
[03:12:38.520 --> 03:12:45.160]  that straight. We don't want, we as Second Amendment supporters do not want the right of a person to
[03:12:45.160 --> 03:12:51.480]  protect themselves with a firearm anywhere in the United States. I don't want to take it away
[03:12:51.480 --> 03:12:57.000]  by any individual or any group or any business or anybody. I realize private property has an
[03:12:57.000 --> 03:13:01.720]  exception. And they can say it's private property. You can't come on our property with a guy.
[03:13:01.720 --> 03:13:07.640]  Educate yourself. Take a class, learn what the laws are in your state. So that way you can actually
[03:13:07.640 --> 03:13:12.360]  And that's Michael Cargill right there. One of the best Second Amendment proponents here in this
[03:13:12.360 --> 03:13:17.880]  city of Austin. He owns a Central Texas gunworks, but just see those teachers they were wearing
[03:13:17.880 --> 03:13:23.080]  armed with reason. How did that work in Oregon? How did that work being armed with reason?
[03:13:23.080 --> 03:13:28.040]  You know, the shooter went in and was asking people what religion they were. It seems to be now he
[03:13:28.040 --> 03:13:34.680]  had a lot of meds in his system. And where did that get him? And now I want to go to a report.
[03:13:35.400 --> 03:13:39.080]  Where did that get the people who were in that classroom actually? Where did it get them? Got
[03:13:39.080 --> 03:13:44.760]  them dead because there was no armed security on that campus and nobody was allowed to be armed.
[03:13:45.800 --> 03:13:51.720]  Ridiculous. And actually, before we get to that, this is how ludicrous the people are at UT of
[03:13:51.720 --> 03:13:58.360]  Austin. There's a, this was out of the local chronicle, sex toys to replace guns at UT Austin
[03:13:58.360 --> 03:14:06.280]  campus carry protest. UT Austin students will hold a strap in protest against campus carry August
[03:14:06.280 --> 03:14:12.200]  24, 2016. They'll be carrying sex toys to class in violation of the campus obscenity policy.
[03:14:13.400 --> 03:14:19.000]  So I don't know if you've ever seen the movie Idiocracy, but they put the the heroes put in
[03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:24.280]  a car for rehabilitation and he goes up against this giant monster truck with a drill on it.
[03:14:24.280 --> 03:14:29.880]  And he's got this kind of rubber kind of looks like a sex toy on the front of it.
[03:14:29.880 --> 03:14:33.640]  That's what you're going to be going against. You know, if you, if some guy decides to come
[03:14:33.640 --> 03:14:38.840]  to the campus, you know, with our armed with a gun and you've got that, what are you going to do?
[03:14:39.640 --> 03:14:45.240]  Beat him with a rubber strap on. I mean, it's ridiculous. And that's the logic that these
[03:14:45.240 --> 03:14:50.120]  people use. And this is going to happen next year. They're already promoting it now nonstop.
[03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:57.160]  Now, you saw one of the, there was a couple of people dealing using logic in that video.
[03:14:58.200 --> 03:15:02.600]  Let's go to another one. This is just from over the weekend. This is Oregon citizens protest
[03:15:02.600 --> 03:15:07.240]  against Obama's gun grab. People really spoke up when their commander and chief showed up
[03:15:07.240 --> 03:15:12.280]  wanting to take away people's guns and using that tragedy as an opportunity to politicize
[03:15:12.280 --> 03:15:17.560]  his anti gun, gun grabbing agenda. And here's what the people who stood up, here's what they had to
[03:15:17.560 --> 03:15:23.320]  say. Jakari Jackson in Roseburg, Oregon. Now we're at the tarmac where Obama's helicopter is expected
[03:15:23.320 --> 03:15:27.160]  to land. There's a large crowd out here. So let's go talk to the people and see what they think
[03:15:27.160 --> 03:15:32.680]  about him coming into their community. It reminded me a lot of the Al Sharpton event where they,
[03:15:32.680 --> 03:15:35.720]  the community came together and they said, we're going to take care of the community. And they
[03:15:35.720 --> 03:15:39.800]  said, stay away. Only this administration is actually arrogant enough to show up anyways.
[03:15:39.800 --> 03:15:45.400]  And what's your sign you have here? I just kind of threw this together this morning. It says,
[03:15:45.400 --> 03:15:50.840]  Obama, no one trusts your lies. And I think the fact that the community here is standing against
[03:15:50.840 --> 03:15:56.840]  his visit, despite him coming out and trying to make a political spectacle of this tragic event.
[03:15:56.840 --> 03:16:01.960]  I think this really speaks to what's going on. So when you talk to your friends, you talk to your
[03:16:01.960 --> 03:16:05.800]  neighbors, you know, what's their thoughts about him coming into town? Not welcome.
[03:16:05.800 --> 03:16:13.880]  And it's not anti Obama. It's anti what his intent was in coming here originally. So,
[03:16:14.680 --> 03:16:19.320]  you know, a lot of people respect the president regardless of their personal beliefs.
[03:16:21.160 --> 03:16:25.720]  But it's, you know, it's unfortunate. He said what he said and you can't take that back.
[03:16:26.280 --> 03:16:29.640]  Now you talked about the reactions of people from around the country, you know, various agendas,
[03:16:29.640 --> 03:16:34.600]  like for you, what does this community need right now to heal? We need the media gone.
[03:16:34.600 --> 03:16:39.480]  And it's our time to heal. And the media is still here thinking this is just this too big of a story.
[03:16:40.040 --> 03:16:42.760]  You know, I mean, they were here for the shooting. They've been here for almost a week,
[03:16:43.400 --> 03:16:47.640]  week, you know, or so at whatever point we're at. Now we're at what, where we eight days,
[03:16:47.640 --> 03:16:51.000]  they've been here, you know, the media is going around this community and asking people if they
[03:16:51.000 --> 03:16:55.320]  knew the shooter. Guess what? We made a statement that we won't announce his name because we had
[03:16:55.320 --> 03:17:01.080]  nine that died that day, not 10. And the shooter is nothing but a murderer. He's a crook and we're
[03:17:01.080 --> 03:17:05.160]  not going to, we're not going to give him that, that praise, you know, and we're just ready for
[03:17:05.160 --> 03:17:09.560]  the media to go home, you know, get Obama, do whatever he's doing here, visit the families,
[03:17:09.560 --> 03:17:12.920]  whatever, and get that, get the heck out of our town because we're ready to just, we're ready to
[03:17:12.920 --> 03:17:21.640]  move on. We're still very fragile, still very vulnerable, you know, but to see the support
[03:17:21.640 --> 03:17:27.720]  here for, for our constitution, for a second amendment is overwhelming and it's awesome to
[03:17:27.720 --> 03:17:35.560]  see that they were all pulling together. I'm pro second amendment. I've, I've probably spent
[03:17:35.560 --> 03:17:41.800]  seven thousand hours riding on patrol and police cars. I worked for the federal government for the
[03:17:41.800 --> 03:17:49.800]  ATF and for the sheriff's department in Orange County. And I seriously doubt this is my position
[03:17:49.800 --> 03:17:57.560]  that anyone on patrol would be out there and in our society without a sidearm. And as we're seeing
[03:17:57.560 --> 03:18:05.240]  this, I think disintegration in our, in our values and our morals and kind of the foundation of what
[03:18:05.240 --> 03:18:10.760]  our country is about. We're seeing this increased escalation of violence around our country.
[03:18:12.120 --> 03:18:17.480]  I don't think the answer to our problems is guns. I think the answer to our problem is,
[03:18:17.480 --> 03:18:25.160]  is the hearts of people being changed. But because we live in a world where violence does happen and
[03:18:25.160 --> 03:18:33.480]  you know, the kind of tragedies that can happen with people. I think there is a necessity for
[03:18:33.480 --> 03:18:38.440]  us to arm ourselves and protect ourselves from that evil. You know, that's a man with peace in
[03:18:38.440 --> 03:18:43.400]  his heart. He doesn't want to go out and kill people. But he goes, the reality is there are other
[03:18:43.400 --> 03:18:48.360]  people out there with guns who will try to kill us and we have to be able to defend ourselves.
[03:18:48.360 --> 03:18:52.920]  And we have these politicians running around with their armed security forces and their details
[03:18:52.920 --> 03:18:58.200]  telling us that we have to disarm. That's when we have to stand up. And then you always have to
[03:18:58.200 --> 03:19:03.400]  support the Second Amendment and keep it healthy by going on to exercising your right, by joining
[03:19:03.400 --> 03:19:08.440]  a shooting club, learning the correct way, teaching your kids the correct way. That's what we have
[03:19:08.440 --> 03:19:12.360]  to do. But how do they do this? How do they change our culture? Well, they do things like this
[03:19:12.360 --> 03:19:18.360]  article from Paul Joseph Watson came out today, MTV saying no can do or a long time no see is racist.
[03:19:18.360 --> 03:19:23.320]  They've been talking about the term peanut gallery is offensive because it was once the place where
[03:19:23.320 --> 03:19:29.880]  black people were forced to sit in a theater during segregation. I never knew that. Apparently,
[03:19:29.880 --> 03:19:36.520]  no can do was used to make fun of the Chinese because they kind of condensed the language down.
[03:19:37.480 --> 03:19:42.440]  Those are sayings that we still have today. And I don't think you're racist if you use them.
[03:19:42.440 --> 03:19:47.000]  It's the intent behind those words. All right, so we'll be back with more. I'm going to get
[03:19:47.000 --> 03:19:52.200]  into this vitamin K shot, baby's first shot to push on you when you have a baby in the hospital.

[03:21:22.120 --> 03:21:27.240]  by globalist concoctions. It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on

[03:24:04.760 --> 03:24:18.120]  And just to continue on what we were talking about with this mindset of people just not knowing
[03:24:18.120 --> 03:24:23.800]  what reality is and the difference in it, Mark Dice went out over the weekend and asked people to
[03:24:23.800 --> 03:24:28.680]  put a value on a silver bar that he had. It's worth about $1,600 depending on the price.
[03:24:29.560 --> 03:24:34.120]  And people didn't even want to do it. This is a 100-ounce silver bar for free. Here's what people
[03:24:34.120 --> 03:24:36.680]  had to say. And then we're going to go to Doug in Minnesota and see what he has to say about
[03:24:36.680 --> 03:24:49.560]  gun control in Obama. So let's roll that clip. I don't know. $500? I don't know. $5,000?
[03:24:52.760 --> 03:24:58.840]  I don't know. Is it real silver? It's real silver. I don't know. I want to say it's like $20
[03:24:58.840 --> 03:25:04.360]  dollars, maybe? $20, $30? I'm not entirely sure how much silver goes for. For the bar?
[03:25:04.360 --> 03:25:10.840]  Yeah. $20 for the bar? $20 to $30, probably. I don't know. That's a 100-ounce bar right there.
[03:25:10.840 --> 03:25:17.800]  A 100-ounce bar for $20. That's about $1,600. $1,600. Yeah. Oh, wow. Well, better luck next time.
[03:25:19.560 --> 03:25:25.880]  You're the next contestant. What's the price of silver? Where you can win this free 100-ounce
[03:25:25.880 --> 03:25:33.720]  silver bar, about seven pounds, if you can tell me how much it's worth, plus or minus 50% of its value.
[03:25:38.280 --> 03:25:38.840]  Oh, gosh.
[03:25:41.320 --> 03:25:47.000]  Per ounce? Just total. Total. Come on. For this whole thing? Yeah. 100 ounces.
[03:25:47.560 --> 03:25:51.720]  100 ounces. You can do it. Come on. Is it? Oh, come on. You got it.
[03:25:51.720 --> 03:26:00.520]  Is it? Oh, my gosh. I don't even know. Oh, my gosh. Is it $500? $500. No, it's about $1,600,
[03:26:00.520 --> 03:26:20.520]  really. So you still weren't within the 50% range.
[03:26:31.320 --> 03:26:35.000]  Maybe even a little bit bigger. It was a 10-ounce bar. Yeah, a 10-ounce bar.
[03:26:35.000 --> 03:26:38.840]  Where's at least $200? Exactly. And they wanted the candy bar instead. I mean,
[03:26:38.840 --> 03:26:43.000]  people just don't understand what real money is. They don't understand because they've been
[03:26:44.200 --> 03:26:49.880]  mind-controlled to say they can't say certain things. Money is only on a credit card.
[03:26:51.080 --> 03:26:54.680]  Pretty soon it's going to be on your thumb. So they're conditioning us to accept
[03:26:54.680 --> 03:26:59.000]  this cashless society control grid that they're going to put us under. Doug, in Minnesota,
[03:26:59.000 --> 03:27:01.240]  you want to talk about gun control and Obama. What's on your mind?
[03:27:03.320 --> 03:27:09.400]  You know, this whole thing about us not having guns, them having guns. You know,
[03:27:09.400 --> 03:27:17.960]  you got Nancy Pelosi saying that she has a concealed carry permit. How about President
[03:27:17.960 --> 03:27:23.480]  Obama turning your drones? You know, I don't think there's enough emphasis put on
[03:27:23.480 --> 03:27:30.920]  how many people have been killed by the drones. So not only how many people, but how many innocent
[03:27:30.920 --> 03:27:37.000]  people, how many wedding parties have been droned. Exactly. And we're focusing so much
[03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:44.120]  on this other garbage that I shouldn't say garbage, but, you know, small amounts of life,
[03:27:44.840 --> 03:27:51.480]  which none is good. But, you know, the thing is what he does is okay. What everybody else does
[03:27:51.480 --> 03:27:56.920]  is wrong. Right. And that's the paradigm they put you in. You're exactly right, Doug. Thanks
[03:27:56.920 --> 03:28:01.960]  for calling. I mean, you totally, that's it. They want to have a certain set of standards
[03:28:01.960 --> 03:28:05.400]  that they get to live by and that they get to dictate and they can change whenever they want
[03:28:05.400 --> 03:28:11.480]  whenever it suits them. And they call it selective enforcement. They decide not to go after one of
[03:28:11.480 --> 03:28:17.080]  their buddies for some infraction. That's probably bilking people for billions of dollars with an,
[03:28:17.080 --> 03:28:21.960]  you know, an energy deal or something. Who knows? But you're out there growing your grass six inches
[03:28:21.960 --> 03:28:27.000]  taller. Well, you got the local government coming after you. You know, it just, it never ends. And
[03:28:27.000 --> 03:28:32.520]  the system has certainly been turned on its head. Let's go to Ivan in Texas. Let's talk about government
[03:28:32.520 --> 03:28:37.640]  water quality. I don't think it's very good, but what do you think? You know, honestly, I can tell
[03:28:37.640 --> 03:28:41.720]  you that pretty much anything and everything we consume is just full of everything that you don't
[03:28:41.720 --> 03:28:48.680]  need. I'm pretty sure that if you're not growing it or it's not filtered by you, you're pretty much
[03:28:48.680 --> 03:28:57.160]  in trouble. And along with many other things on top of gun control, I'll tell you this. I worked
[03:28:57.160 --> 03:29:04.280]  at a public range shooting range for three years. My job for $8.25 was to make sure everybody went
[03:29:04.280 --> 03:29:11.320]  home alive. Okay, $8.25. I risked my life to make sure everyone else had just the proper knowledge
[03:29:11.320 --> 03:29:15.400]  enough to say that they could stay alive to go home and have a family to go home to and say that
[03:29:15.400 --> 03:29:20.440]  they have the right to own guns. There you go. Hey, let me ask you, how do you filter your water?
[03:29:22.200 --> 03:29:27.000]  You know, honestly, I'm one of those guys who's, you know, I just purchased one of those filters
[03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:33.400]  that you can get anywhere at one of your local retailers that, you know, just go from there.
[03:29:33.400 --> 03:29:38.040]  And I mean, it's not that hard. I mean, that's a good start. Yeah, that's a good start.
[03:29:38.040 --> 03:29:43.080]  One of those pitcher fillers, I use the, the, the propure system and I got the fluoride filters.
[03:29:43.080 --> 03:29:46.280]  I get the fluoride out of my water because I don't want me and my family dumbed down. Stay
[03:29:46.280 --> 03:29:50.280]  tuned. We got half an hour left. We're on the march. Fourth hour of overdrive. Sorry,

[03:29:58.520 --> 03:30:03.480]  Presidential candidates today strategize over every last detail of a candidate's image,
[03:30:03.480 --> 03:30:08.760]  especially an identity candidate like Hillary. How important is it for there to be a woman
[03:30:08.760 --> 03:30:14.360]  president in the United States? National Journal has pointed out that candidates now view soundtracks
[03:30:14.360 --> 03:30:20.680]  as a key part of that carefully crafted image. So maybe Hillary should choose a campaign song
[03:30:20.680 --> 03:30:29.000]  that plays against type, you know, humble. I'm sorry. Hillary has paid a consulting firm
[03:30:29.000 --> 03:30:35.400]  $9,000 to create a soundtrack for her campaign. I just don't think people would believe this song,
[03:30:35.400 --> 03:30:40.760]  though. She's being abandoned by unions, by multinational corporate donors who are worried.
[03:30:41.400 --> 03:30:48.760]  44% of her Twitter followers, 1.4 million are fake. Maybe her campaign theme should be
[03:30:48.760 --> 03:30:55.960]  help. I need somebody help. Not just anybody for wars.com. I'm David Knight.

[03:33:07.640 --> 03:33:22.600]  We are at the bottom of the hour. Thanks for tuning in to the fourth hour overdrive of The Alex Jones
[03:33:22.600 --> 03:33:28.200]  Show. I'm your host Rob Dew. And before we get to the exclusive audio that I recorded of the
[03:33:28.200 --> 03:33:35.000]  pediatricians that you have to deal with when you have a young baby, young child, we had a baby
[03:33:35.000 --> 03:33:40.680]  daughter. We had three boys and a daughter, so that's pretty interesting. We weren't expecting
[03:33:40.680 --> 03:33:46.120]  a daughter. We were expecting another son, but hey, we're very happy. She's very healthy and
[03:33:46.120 --> 03:33:50.520]  everything's good. But one thing the pediatricians love to push on you are shots in the hospital.
[03:33:50.520 --> 03:33:55.000]  They want to push that hepatitis B shot because they're afraid your little baby might start using
[03:33:55.000 --> 03:33:59.720]  intravenous drugs right there in the hospital. They also want to push the vitamin K shot,
[03:33:59.720 --> 03:34:04.840]  which technically is not a vaccine, but it does have some interesting, at least one interesting
[03:34:04.840 --> 03:34:11.960]  chemical in it, a preservative of alcohol, which makes up nearly 1% of the shot. And it has over
[03:34:11.960 --> 03:34:17.560]  20,000 times the amount of vitamin K that they need. And I'm going to read you the warning that's
[03:34:17.560 --> 03:34:23.800]  on the insert for that vitamin K shot. So I always say read the insert. We'll get to that in a second.
[03:34:23.800 --> 03:34:30.360]  But first, secret 12, vitamin B12 is now 20% off. This is a product I use personally. I use it in
[03:34:30.360 --> 03:34:35.240]  conjunction with super male vitality. When I'm out playing basketball, I play basketball once a week
[03:34:35.240 --> 03:34:41.400]  in a pretty competitive rec league. And if I didn't take my secret 12 and super male vitality
[03:34:41.400 --> 03:34:46.680]  together, I would be pooped out after maybe 15 minutes of playing, but I'm able to go the entire
[03:34:46.680 --> 03:34:52.760]  game at my age. I think that's pretty amazing. I'm playing with guys who are 10, 15 years younger
[03:34:52.760 --> 03:35:00.280]  than me, and I'm able to keep up. So check out secret 12. It's now 20% off. And also, we have the

[03:35:49.000 --> 03:35:54.120]  tell you where though. And that's for me and my family. But the extra food I did have before
[03:35:54.120 --> 03:36:00.280]  that, I rotate my food out and I give it to my family, those who need it. And I want to get to
[03:36:00.280 --> 03:36:07.240]  this vitamin K shot debacle that I had three pediatricians trying to push the shot only. And
[03:36:07.240 --> 03:36:12.600]  you know, my first three kids, we said, no, we just want to use the oral version of the vitamin
[03:36:12.600 --> 03:36:16.520]  K. We just want to give them the oral dose through their mouth, let it go through the digestive
[03:36:16.520 --> 03:36:22.200]  system and let it percolate out that way. And this is the reason why. And I went and looked up the
[03:36:23.320 --> 03:36:29.560]  insert for the vitamin K. This is from Merck. And guys, just zoom in on here. You can pull it up
[03:36:29.560 --> 03:36:34.120]  right there. Zoom in right on that. Let's look at that warning. And it says warning intravenous use
[03:36:34.120 --> 03:36:39.080]  severe reactions, including fatalities have occurred during and immediately after the administration of
[03:36:39.880 --> 03:36:42.760]  I'm not even going to try to pronounce that name. That's the vitamin K shot though.
[03:36:42.760 --> 03:36:49.640]  Typically, the severe reactions have resembled hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, including shot,
[03:36:49.640 --> 03:36:54.600]  cardiac and respiratory arrest. Some patients have exhibited these severe reactions after
[03:36:54.600 --> 03:36:58.360]  receiving it for the first time. So there we go. And they're talking about intravenous use.
[03:36:59.080 --> 03:37:02.600]  And my pediatrician tried to school me saying, well, we're not shooting it in
[03:37:02.600 --> 03:37:07.080]  straight into the vein. We're putting it into the muscle. Well, then it goes into the bloodstream.
[03:37:07.080 --> 03:37:12.200]  But they say not as fast. And well, I'm not going to sit here and tell you what she said. This is
[03:37:12.200 --> 03:37:18.280]  pediatrician number one who first starts off with a history of scare tactics. I call this the soft
[03:37:18.280 --> 03:37:23.720]  scare tactic that they like to use talking about the bleeding disease, which does happen in infants.
[03:37:23.720 --> 03:37:28.760]  They can bleed. But there are ways to prevent that and ways to boost their vitamin K levels
[03:37:28.760 --> 03:37:33.240]  even before they were born. And I'll get to those. This is what other doctors have told me. And these
[03:37:33.240 --> 03:37:38.360]  are things that I use. So I'm not providing medical advice here, but you do need to learn
[03:37:38.360 --> 03:37:44.200]  how they push this stuff on you. My pediatrician, I was recording her from my iPhone. So here is
[03:37:44.200 --> 03:37:50.040]  the first one. This was in the hospital. And she came in to try and guide us into getting the shot.
[03:37:50.040 --> 03:37:59.000]  So here's the first clip. So I want to talk to you all about the vitamin K. So vitamin K has been
[03:37:59.000 --> 03:38:04.840]  around since 1960. And before 1960, I don't know if you've ever heard of hemorrhagic disease in
[03:38:04.840 --> 03:38:09.800]  newborns. So newborns, vitamin K is not transferred through the placenta very well. And babies can't
[03:38:09.800 --> 03:38:14.600]  build the stores for vitamin K. So they're pretty much deficient of vitamin K when they're first
[03:38:14.600 --> 03:38:20.120]  born. Right. Their bodies don't naturally start to produce it until they're several weeks old,
[03:38:20.120 --> 03:38:25.800]  like usually about four to six weeks. Once moms that are breastfeeding, you know, get that good
[03:38:25.800 --> 03:38:30.280]  bacteria in their gut. And then that gets colonized with all that good flora. And that flora makes
[03:38:30.280 --> 03:38:35.720]  the vitamin D endodgiously, you know, on its own. So it takes several weeks for that to happen.
[03:38:35.720 --> 03:38:41.080]  So babies are somewhat susceptible in the first several weeks of life to have chronic deficiency.
[03:38:41.640 --> 03:38:46.840]  Before 1960, the rate of hemorrhagic disease in newborn, and that's when babies could bruise
[03:38:46.840 --> 03:38:49.560]  all over, they'll have blood in their, they can have blood in their urine, they can have blood in
[03:38:49.560 --> 03:38:56.840]  their stool, they can have a bleeding in their head, was, you know, one out of 10,000. And then
[03:38:56.840 --> 03:39:01.800]  for late onset, and then one out of 1,000, I'm sorry, one for 10,000 for early onset. And then
[03:39:01.800 --> 03:39:08.600]  there's late onset, which is several weeks later, when 1,000 babies. They did a study not too long
[03:39:08.600 --> 03:39:18.280]  ago on 1,000 babies, MRIs. And they found that one of every four babies born non-traumatic, vaginal,
[03:39:18.280 --> 03:39:23.400]  no vacuum, no, you know, no force. It's nothing, just a normal delivery. Because delivery itself
[03:39:23.400 --> 03:39:28.440]  is not a compression, right? And there's a risk involved there. One of every four babies actually
[03:39:28.440 --> 03:39:33.240]  has an asymptomatic bleeding in their head, meaning a bleed without, you know, they don't have symptoms
[03:39:33.240 --> 03:39:39.960]  of initial, perfectly healthy looking babies. If babies don't get the clotting factor they need,
[03:39:39.960 --> 03:39:45.000]  and they don't get the vitamin K, the risk of that is the late onset presentation of hemorrhagic
[03:39:45.000 --> 03:39:49.720]  disease in newborn babies continues, and they develop seizures when they're on several weeks
[03:39:49.720 --> 03:39:53.800]  after life, and of course that's life threatening, you know, and that's a very scary thing.
[03:39:54.680 --> 03:39:59.800]  Very scary, they want you to get that shot, because if they can just set the stage early on
[03:39:59.800 --> 03:40:04.760]  that you have to have shots to be healthy, they can continue that process. And every time they
[03:40:04.760 --> 03:40:10.200]  have a shot for something, every time, whether you need it or not, they've got something ready for you.
[03:40:10.200 --> 03:40:15.880]  I want to get your attention on, this is from 2010, this is a potential dark side of the routine
[03:40:15.880 --> 03:40:21.880]  newborn vitamin K shot, it's off marcola.com, and it's a pretty long article, and there's also an
[03:40:21.880 --> 03:40:25.080]  interview in there, which I encourage you to listen to from a doctor talking about it, and I think
[03:40:25.080 --> 03:40:31.960]  he's from Germany. But the amount of vitamin K injected into newborns is 20,000 times the needed
[03:40:31.960 --> 03:40:36.200]  dose. Additionally, the injection may contain preservatives that can be toxic to your baby's
[03:40:36.200 --> 03:40:40.520]  delicate immune system, and among the most significant is inflicting pain immediately
[03:40:40.520 --> 03:40:44.840]  after birth, which has the potential to cause psychological emotional damage and trauma to
[03:40:44.840 --> 03:40:51.880]  newborns, I don't know how they figure that out, but maybe they can. But I mean, 20,000 times the
[03:40:51.880 --> 03:40:57.880]  amount of vitamin K that you need. And let's go to this, and then he's talking about the other
[03:40:57.880 --> 03:41:03.560]  preservatives here at the bottom, you guys can zoom in on this, this is from the Merck insert,
[03:41:03.560 --> 03:41:10.920]  right there, 0.9 of the benzo alcohol, 0.9%. So if you were to give your baby a shot of alcohol,
[03:41:10.920 --> 03:41:16.120]  you could get arrested, but we're allowed to inject it right into their muscle mass, into
[03:41:16.120 --> 03:41:20.840]  their bloodstream. And so then the pediatrician went on to tell me about an Australian study
[03:41:21.400 --> 03:41:24.520]  that they had taken, because we said, well, what about the oral? Why can't you just
[03:41:24.520 --> 03:41:29.560]  prescribe us the oral and we'll do it? We don't mind doing it multi doses. And this is what she
[03:41:29.560 --> 03:41:34.920]  had to say. And it's been safe. It's been around since 1960. It only has five ingredients in it,
[03:41:34.920 --> 03:41:42.280]  alcohol, cornstarch, no aluminum, there's no mercury. It's really a very safe injection.
[03:41:42.280 --> 03:41:46.920]  I think it's castor oil or some sort of castor oil. Right. Castor oil is one. Yeah. So, you know,
[03:41:46.920 --> 03:41:55.000]  it's all very basic ingredients that are very small, small, minute amounts. So in Australia,
[03:41:55.800 --> 03:42:01.560]  there was, you know, they did this period of time where people were refusing it and they were just
[03:42:01.560 --> 03:42:06.680]  offering oral binding K. And then they found that the oral binding K didn't work. The instance of
[03:42:06.680 --> 03:42:12.040]  hemorrhagic diseases, they weren't actually shot back up. There you go. So there's another
[03:42:12.040 --> 03:42:16.520]  scare tactic shot right up. You don't get this shot because they tried it. So then I went and
[03:42:16.520 --> 03:42:20.520]  after she said this, she goes, well, there'll be a different pediatrician in tomorrow and you can
[03:42:20.520 --> 03:42:25.320]  talk to her. But I went and looked up some studies and I just typed in oral vitamin K.
[03:42:25.320 --> 03:42:33.480]  I think a couple other keywords and studies. Here's one from Germany that says the oral vitamin
[03:42:33.480 --> 03:42:41.000]  K is just as effective as the shot. Here's one from Switzerland. It says pretty much the same
[03:42:41.000 --> 03:42:45.880]  thing that is just as good. Here's a multi-country study from Australia, Germany, Netherlands,
[03:42:45.880 --> 03:42:48.920]  and Switzerland. And I couldn't find the Australian studies she was talking about,
[03:42:48.920 --> 03:42:53.000]  at least in my initial search. Here's one from Denmark. And here at the end, they say,
[03:42:53.000 --> 03:42:58.760]  we consider the weekly regimen safe and appropriate. And so they did that. That was with
[03:42:59.640 --> 03:43:06.440]  135,000 infants. Geez. That's a big number, not just a thousand. Here's one from Thailand
[03:43:06.440 --> 03:43:10.840]  in Bangkok. The inexpensive oral pediatric, oh, inexpensive. Maybe that's why they like
[03:43:10.840 --> 03:43:15.960]  the shot so much because it costs more money than the oral version. So the oral pediatric
[03:43:15.960 --> 03:43:20.520]  drops may provide a practical form of primary health care for routine vitamin K in newborns.
[03:43:20.520 --> 03:43:26.680]  Here's one from India. The oral vitamin K is as effective as the injectable vitamin K.
[03:43:28.120 --> 03:43:32.360]  Here's one. This is, I'm not sure what country this is from, but they said it's translated
[03:43:32.360 --> 03:43:36.760]  from Spanish. Oral vitamin K is as effective as the intermuscular route and prevention of
[03:43:36.760 --> 03:43:44.600]  hemorrhagic disease in newborns. And here's the last one, just a 27-year study, I believe,
[03:43:44.600 --> 03:43:50.520]  they, from 1967, and this came out in 95. So they conclude we have met our duty of appropriate
[03:43:50.520 --> 03:43:56.920]  care. And they've, they gave the babies oral vitamin K, a single oral dose of vitamin K.
[03:43:57.880 --> 03:44:02.440]  So when I said, well, hey, what about this intravenous warning that's on the shot, on the
[03:44:02.440 --> 03:44:07.480]  insert? Here's, here's what the pediatrician had to say about that. She was ready.
[03:44:07.480 --> 03:44:14.680]  Into the muscle, we don't put into the vein. And by the way, anything you put intravenously, any kind of
[03:44:14.680 --> 03:44:20.440]  medication or vitamin, those risks that's going into the, you know, circulation immediately,
[03:44:20.440 --> 03:44:25.560]  right? Intramuscularly, it's a completely different absorption rate. And, you know,
[03:44:25.560 --> 03:44:30.200]  where we put it in the thigh and where we locate where the muscle is, you know, to put it in,
[03:44:30.200 --> 03:44:33.160]  it's not close to any vein, there's no risk of it. It's more like going in,
[03:44:33.160 --> 03:44:37.240]  directly into a vein that you worry about and you're not going to have that risk going into the thigh.
[03:44:37.240 --> 03:44:40.680]  But isn't that going to, when you're injecting it into the muscle, isn't that still going to go
[03:44:40.680 --> 03:44:45.160]  into the bloodstream more quickly than before? No, it's not fuses. It goes into the bloodstream,
[03:44:45.160 --> 03:44:50.280]  but it doesn't go at the high, high volume that you're talking about when you put it in directly
[03:44:50.280 --> 03:44:58.120]  into a vein. There you go. So you're still injecting it into the body, but I'm not a doctor. I don't
[03:44:58.120 --> 03:45:03.240]  know anything, but I just found nine studies, eight studies that show that the oral vitamin K is just
[03:45:03.240 --> 03:45:11.080]  as effective as the shot. And, but they would not prescribe the oral vitamin K for me. And
[03:45:11.080 --> 03:45:15.720]  she ended the whole speech. This was about a 20 minute meeting I had with the pediatrician.
[03:45:15.720 --> 03:45:20.520]  She was very nice lady, you know, of course she means well, I'm sure she does. She's just been
[03:45:20.520 --> 03:45:26.840]  conditioned by the Rockefeller medical paradigm. And here's what she had to say about having too
[03:45:26.840 --> 03:45:31.320]  much information available to parents because it's a very scary time. So here's. And I know
[03:45:31.320 --> 03:45:35.000]  what there's a lot of information out there and it's hard. I think this is the hardest time to be
[03:45:35.000 --> 03:45:40.200]  a parent. It really is. It's the hardest time to be a parent because there's so much information
[03:45:40.200 --> 03:45:44.840]  out there. And how do you filter through all that information to find out what's real, what's, you
[03:45:44.840 --> 03:45:49.320]  know, a real concern and what's not. Right. You know, I mean, I know you want to do what's best
[03:45:49.320 --> 03:45:54.680]  for her and I know you don't want to take any unnecessary with us, you know. Yeah, yeah,
[03:45:54.680 --> 03:45:58.920]  this is hard. There's so much information out there. I think it's harder for pediatricians
[03:45:58.920 --> 03:46:05.160]  to do their Rockefeller mandated job of prescribing pharmaceuticals based, you know,
[03:46:05.160 --> 03:46:10.360]  on oil derivatives and other such dangerous chemicals and SSRIs and everything else they
[03:46:10.360 --> 03:46:15.560]  want to inject in our bodies to keep us healthy and keep us safe. I think it's a harder job for
[03:46:15.560 --> 03:46:21.560]  them now because we have that information available. These final two clips are, I'm just,
[03:46:21.560 --> 03:46:25.800]  you guys can just run these together. This is from the pediatrician who came the next day and I
[03:46:25.800 --> 03:46:31.000]  said, Hey, can we just get the oral? And she said, it's not effective. It's not. And then when you go
[03:46:31.000 --> 03:46:35.480]  to a visit to your outside pediatrician, which we don't make too many of those because our kids
[03:46:35.480 --> 03:46:43.320]  don't get sick. I wonder why. Yeah. Anyway, I'm going to play play those two together. And then
[03:46:43.320 --> 03:46:47.560]  we'll move on. That's some other news to cover. So let's go to these final two clips. These are
[03:46:47.560 --> 03:46:52.040]  so three different pediatricians. None of them will prescribe the oral vitamin K anymore because
[03:46:52.040 --> 03:46:56.440]  it's been deemed because of a 1,000 person study in Australia. It's been deemed unaffected.
[03:46:57.400 --> 03:47:04.280]  Talk with you all about the vitamin K and that. Did you, did you all decide to give that to her
[03:47:04.280 --> 03:47:09.560]  or just defer on that? Well, we, we'd still like to give her the oral version of that and have
[03:47:11.560 --> 03:47:15.640]  Yeah, as opposed to nothing. That's what we'd, that's what we prefer to do.
[03:47:15.640 --> 03:47:24.840]  Because the oral is not readily absorbed and we don't know how much the baby gets. So it's
[03:47:25.720 --> 03:47:33.880]  not really that effective as having the IM. Oh, so the pediatrician didn't want to
[03:47:35.080 --> 03:47:41.880]  keep because we did this with all the other boys and it seemed to work out fine. And so we asked
[03:47:41.880 --> 03:47:49.240]  her about it and neither one of the pediatricians wanted to. Yeah, no, they found the, I know
[03:47:49.240 --> 03:47:54.200]  y'all did it with boys. They found the advocacy is just not that good and there's not an exact dose.
[03:47:54.200 --> 03:47:58.360]  And so that's why we usually don't recommend doing the oral vitamin K.
[03:47:59.880 --> 03:48:05.080]  So they can only give it the in shot form. That's it. That's the only, only thing. I got
[03:48:05.080 --> 03:48:08.520]  Sherry on the line. I want to go to Sherry next because she wanted to call about vaccines and
[03:48:08.520 --> 03:48:13.880]  shots. And then we'll get to Herbert in Florida. Sherry, what did you have to share with us today?
[03:48:13.880 --> 03:48:21.160]  Let's book in this little shot vaccine segment we just did. Well, all the vaccines that they're
[03:48:21.160 --> 03:48:27.160]  doing and, you know, the flu shots lining up at King's Super and get your discount for flu shots.
[03:48:27.800 --> 03:48:32.680]  I see it as just another piece of the puzzle trying to get, you know, the people aren't
[03:48:32.680 --> 03:48:39.160]  awake yet. They're going to dumb this down with the vaccine. Well, they're trying to make you
[03:48:39.160 --> 03:48:43.000]  sick. Definitely. I think, I don't think those things help. I think they're designed to lower
[03:48:43.000 --> 03:48:50.280]  your immune system. Exactly. And cause cancer, whether you die a year later or 20 years later.
[03:48:50.280 --> 03:48:54.840]  And for the people that don't get the shot, you know, they come at us from other ways with the
[03:48:54.840 --> 03:49:01.800]  GMOs and the second amendment, the first amendment. But and Alex, you know, the people that won't
[03:49:01.800 --> 03:49:09.240]  wake up. I talked to people, my mom, my neighbors. Why can't our governors review like the governor
[03:49:09.240 --> 03:49:17.240]  of Texas? Why can't they just say we're not going to enforce any of this or succeed from the federal?
[03:49:17.240 --> 03:49:22.040]  Well, there's a council of governors actually. And a lot of those people buy into the federal myth
[03:49:22.040 --> 03:49:26.360]  that if only the federal government knows what's best for you and nobody else knows anything.
[03:49:26.360 --> 03:49:30.040]  And we have to follow what the federal government says because they're our mommy and daddy.
[03:49:30.040 --> 03:49:34.280]  And everybody's people are brought up like that, you know, that the federal government is the
[03:49:34.280 --> 03:49:38.280]  be all end all whatever they say is gospel. And we have to listen to it. We shouldn't do our own
[03:49:38.280 --> 03:49:41.880]  research. Why would you want to do that? Why would you want to listen to somebody like a neurosurgeon
[03:49:41.880 --> 03:49:47.640]  like Dr. Blalock, who talks about the immune, how the immune system is stimulated every time you
[03:49:47.640 --> 03:49:51.880]  inject a baby with a vaccine and how it goes crazy. And that's why you have all these things like
[03:49:51.880 --> 03:49:58.520]  allergies and asthma and kids like an exponential rates from where even when I was a kid, I remember
[03:49:58.520 --> 03:50:02.920]  maybe one person having asthma. Now there's like on my kids teams, there's like five kids with
[03:50:02.920 --> 03:50:07.480]  inhalers. Everybody's got it now. It's crazy that that's what they do. Sherry, thanks for calling.
[03:50:08.440 --> 03:50:11.160]  Herbert in Florida, you want to talk about censorship? What's going on?
[03:50:11.880 --> 03:50:18.120]  Yes, sir. There's been recently a call for censoring the internet by Google ideas who have
[03:50:18.120 --> 03:50:24.840]  invited two feminist provocateurs to the UN to talk about how women are being viciously attacked
[03:50:24.840 --> 03:50:30.920]  online. And both of these women are involved in the Gamergate controversy, one of which sleeping
[03:50:30.920 --> 03:50:36.200]  with indie journalists to get reviews. And now they are trying to censor the web. I'm wondering
[03:50:36.200 --> 03:50:41.400]  if you heard about this and you know how far this may go. Well, I will talk about that after the
[03:50:41.400 --> 03:50:45.640]  break. I'm going to have David Knight in here in studio. He actually interviewed us. Paul just
[03:50:45.640 --> 03:50:50.200]  was interviewed somebody on Gamergate, but he'll definitely have some ideas on that. And I have
[03:50:50.200 --> 03:50:53.560]  some of my own. Stay tuned. We got one more segment here, the fourth hour overdrive. Thanks for calling
[03:50:53.560 --> 03:50:59.160]  Herbert. You're watching live right now info wars.com, prisonplanet.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[03:51:04.440 --> 03:51:08.280]  Hey neighbor, what are you doing digging? You had a heart attack last year.
[03:51:09.000 --> 03:51:13.960]  Oh, I know. I was told no more hard labor. Then why are you digging? Well, I've been taking
[03:51:13.960 --> 03:51:18.840]  Extendivite. It's been approved to help my heart. Extendivite. Is that a new drug?
[03:51:18.840 --> 03:51:24.200]  No, not a drug. It's more like an herbal combination made from garlic and cayenne.
[03:51:24.200 --> 03:51:28.680]  Herbal? How can that help? Well, actually, we've taken herbs for thousands of years.
[03:51:28.680 --> 03:51:33.480]  Extendivite is doing the job for me. Does your doctor know about Extendivite?
[03:51:33.480 --> 03:51:38.360]  Yeah, my doctor knows and he said it seems to be working for you. So don't stop taking it. I feel
[03:51:38.360 --> 03:51:49.560]  great taking Extendivite. I don't want to stop. To order, call 1-877-928-8822. That's 1-877-928-8822

[03:53:56.200 --> 03:54:15.480]  Final segment of the Overdrive Hour. This is Rob Do. Joining me in the studio is David Knight.
[03:54:15.480 --> 03:54:20.840]  Our last caller was talking about GamerGate and how the UN had invited these feminists
[03:54:20.840 --> 03:54:25.640]  up to talk about how if you say anything bad about somebody online you could get censored off the
[03:54:25.640 --> 03:54:30.920]  web. They basically want to kill any type of I guess trolling out there and I think that's just
[03:54:30.920 --> 03:54:35.080]  part of the internet and you have to learn how to deal with it. People are afraid to deal with it,
[03:54:35.080 --> 03:54:40.360]  David. There's so many stories of kids who commit suicide because somebody said something bad about
[03:54:40.360 --> 03:54:44.040]  them online. I think we need to like toughen up our kids a little more and take them out in the
[03:54:44.040 --> 03:54:49.400]  woods and show them how to be a real human. Part of it, Rob, is this whole thing with multiculturalism.
[03:54:49.960 --> 03:54:53.720]  Everybody is being shamed about this and about that and we have to understand
[03:54:53.720 --> 03:54:58.360]  that it's a tool of social control. So we're going to talk about the day in light of Columbus Day.
[03:54:58.360 --> 03:55:02.120]  So we're going to talk about on the nightly news. The original racist. Exactly. Well,
[03:55:02.840 --> 03:55:07.640]  and that's the other thing. We need to get over the oversimplification of history where we want
[03:55:07.640 --> 03:55:12.680]  to paint our side as completely good, completely in the right. These hagiographies where this
[03:55:12.680 --> 03:55:16.520]  guy is a saint, that guy is a saint, that civilization did nothing wrong. We need to
[03:55:16.520 --> 03:55:22.200]  understand that there are broader issues here. Where can we come together on issues and I think
[03:55:22.200 --> 03:55:25.560]  that we're going to look tonight on the nightly news. We're going to look at Columbus Day.
[03:55:25.560 --> 03:55:29.400]  We're going to look at what conservatives say about it. We're going to look at what
[03:55:29.400 --> 03:55:34.440]  Russell Means said about it as an Indian. Okay. And there's a common ground there though. And
[03:55:34.440 --> 03:55:39.640]  that is respect for the individual and true multiculturalism, which is being wiped out
[03:55:39.640 --> 03:55:43.880]  in Europe right now. Here's a picture I took of the Columbus. In Barcelona,
[03:55:43.880 --> 03:55:49.080]  they have a giant statue of Columbus there and there's a picture of it. And I didn't see
[03:55:49.080 --> 03:55:54.920]  any graffiti. Anybody saying that this guy is racist in Spain, they seem to kind of revere him,
[03:55:54.920 --> 03:55:58.360]  especially, you know, what he was Portuguese, right? And he said for Spain.
[03:55:59.800 --> 03:56:05.240]  And, you know, but basically under the Spanish flag, he went and discovered America. He thought
[03:56:05.240 --> 03:56:11.320]  he was discovering India. That's how we get Indians. And, you know, is that a bad thing?
[03:56:11.320 --> 03:56:16.280]  Is that a bad thing that people expanded out into new areas? And, you know,
[03:56:16.280 --> 03:56:19.720]  well, you have to understand that- Is that so bad? Yeah, you have to understand that the
[03:56:19.720 --> 03:56:23.480]  indigenous people had slavery. They had wars. They had all the issues because, you know what,
[03:56:23.480 --> 03:56:28.840]  they're human. And so we have the human condition. And regardless of what language you speak or what
[03:56:28.840 --> 03:56:34.200]  nation you belong to, we've all got the same issues. What came out of the American experiment,
[03:56:34.200 --> 03:56:38.920]  though, was an understanding of individual liberty that has now been lost. Part of that was based
[03:56:38.920 --> 03:56:43.560]  on Christianity, treating people as individuals and saying, we need to treat everyone as a creature
[03:56:43.560 --> 03:56:48.440]  of God. The whole concept of natural rights, that's gone as well because the churches themselves
[03:56:48.440 --> 03:56:53.320]  have now looked to government as being the tool that's going to accomplish social change.
[03:56:53.320 --> 03:56:57.080]  They have abdicated their responsibility just like Congress has. And so we're going to take
[03:56:57.080 --> 03:57:01.160]  a look at that. We're going to look at the neocolonialism of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[03:57:01.160 --> 03:57:04.280]  You know, one of the big issues that everybody has, and rightfully so,
[03:57:04.280 --> 03:57:08.440]  is a transatlantic slave trade that came about because of colonialism. Well, now we've got
[03:57:08.440 --> 03:57:13.320]  the transatlantic partnership. And it is going to essentially set up a new kind of slavery.
[03:57:13.320 --> 03:57:18.920]  We now have, colonialism has gone full circle. Now we have Europe, which used to be all these
[03:57:18.920 --> 03:57:23.640]  individual countries, very small with their own language, their own culture, their own currency.
[03:57:23.640 --> 03:57:29.560]  That is now being subsumed into a monolithic culture for globalist purposes. So now they
[03:57:29.560 --> 03:57:33.640]  basically are doing the same thing to Europe that the Europeans initially did to the Indians.
[03:57:33.640 --> 03:57:37.800]  How can we stop this? How can we learn from history and stop the repeating of these mistakes?
[03:57:37.800 --> 03:57:42.040]  Well, and all the trendies out there that'll be tweeting their, you know, Columbus was a racist.
[03:57:42.040 --> 03:57:47.720]  Don't forget that out on Twitter and everything. They're using their slave manufactured iPhones
[03:57:47.720 --> 03:57:51.480]  or other personal devices. They're going to be using those. They don't seem to have a problem
[03:57:51.480 --> 03:57:55.720]  with that because, you know, it's not trendy to talk about the slavery going on in China,
[03:57:55.720 --> 03:58:00.280]  but it's trendy to talk about how Columbus was this racist slave master owner,
[03:58:01.480 --> 03:58:05.320]  you know, killing people. And yet people did die. But you know what? Indians were killing
[03:58:05.320 --> 03:58:10.360]  each other before Columbus arrived. That's right. You know, and hey, that's why we need the Second
[03:58:10.360 --> 03:58:16.680]  Amendment more than ever. And my bow and arrow or my gun. Exactly. Exactly. There you go.
[03:58:17.320 --> 03:58:21.160]  So with that, that is our show today. This has been the fourth hour overdrive with Rob
[03:58:21.160 --> 03:58:25.240]  Dew hosting tomorrow. I think it's going to be David Knight sitting in the chair hosting.
[03:58:25.240 --> 03:58:30.200]  So stay tuned tonight for 7 p.m. Central for the info wars nightly news. And then back here tomorrow,
[03:58:30.200 --> 03:58:41.160]  2 p.m. to 3 or 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central. Thanks for watching.
