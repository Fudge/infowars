[00:00.000 --> 00:11.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.520 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:23.160]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:23.160 --> 00:30.360]  we have a very important radio show lined up for you today massive issues of
[00:30.360 --> 00:39.560]  great import coming up David Ike's gonna be on with us in the third and fourth
[00:39.560 --> 00:45.680]  hour for two full hours today to talk about a host of issues always interesting
[00:45.680 --> 00:50.520]  to get his perspective and his his take on the world through his rose colored
[00:50.520 --> 00:56.280]  darkly we all wear one so we all have different perspectives as our soul
[00:56.280 --> 01:03.660]  stares out through our eyes into the wider universe no man is an island to
[01:03.660 --> 01:09.720]  himself then we feel like it sometimes Sam LaBriere is going to be joining us
[01:09.720 --> 01:14.800]  with some huge breaking news on that Bilderberg steering group meeting they
[01:14.800 --> 01:19.480]  had for four days last week that ended on Friday he'll be popping in for 30
[01:19.480 --> 01:30.960]  minutes in the next hour a lot of things have been crystallizing for me or my
[01:30.960 --> 01:37.360]  level of knowledge has been hitting jump points where I tend to always
[01:37.360 --> 01:41.840]  gradually learn more about all the world works now the globalist operate and I
[01:41.840 --> 01:45.240]  am I'm always having you know basic realizations about their program their
[01:45.240 --> 01:52.080]  paradigm the way they carry out their operations but just like with development
[01:52.080 --> 01:58.480]  of technologies or development of the species or earthquakes with tectonic
[01:58.480 --> 02:03.680]  developments things tend to happen in big jumps and I have jump points all the
[02:03.680 --> 02:09.000]  time but I had a big one last night it almost knocked me over and when
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.480]  something's fresh and new to you you know there's so many possibilities and so
[02:14.480 --> 02:23.760]  many fractal factors that entered into it it's it's it's almost indescribable and
[02:23.760 --> 02:27.200]  I was scrabbling around in the house looking for my little voice recorder so
[02:27.200 --> 02:33.720]  I could do an audio blog and couldn't find it and then always in the morning
[02:33.720 --> 02:39.560]  it's there's the day's distractions and office business and other things that
[02:39.560 --> 02:54.120]  seem to cloud the the pronunciation the articulation of the deeper truths but so
[02:54.120 --> 02:57.720]  much of what I'm gonna talk about today we've already stated in so many ways here
[02:57.720 --> 03:04.280]  it's just that it really hit me last night like a ton of bricks that the
[03:04.280 --> 03:08.480]  public really is being dumbed down the public really is having the English
[03:08.480 --> 03:14.320]  language and other major world languages reduced in the vocabulary size and in
[03:14.320 --> 03:21.680]  the speed of speech and that large portions of the population are basically
[03:21.680 --> 03:27.520]  mentally retarded now both chemically but also culturally and that it's a
[03:27.520 --> 03:36.840]  feedback loop in this race to the bottom this race away from renaissance to a
[03:36.840 --> 03:51.560]  type of bleeding squat ogre-like grunting creatures I saw a video clip up on
[03:51.560 --> 03:55.640]  prisonplanet.com and info wars.com called corporate media cyber bullying
[03:55.640 --> 04:08.000]  propaganda from a television program called yo teach and when I watch this I
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.160]  realize how much I'm out of the loop you know I think I've got a handle on the
[04:12.160 --> 04:15.400]  globalist and what they're doing and how they're operating but I'm mainly
[04:15.400 --> 04:19.520]  reading newspapers and watching cable news and reading government documents
[04:19.520 --> 04:27.280]  and bills and the government documents and bills and white papers and MIT and
[04:27.280 --> 04:32.600]  Stanford Research Institute and IBM Prospectus and Google reports the
[04:32.600 --> 04:38.800]  stockholders are light years ahead of the pablum on Fox and CNN but then what
[04:38.800 --> 04:44.720]  the general public doesn't even watch news is tuned into on the sitcoms I
[04:44.720 --> 04:55.040]  mean that is I mean the mainstream TV news is quantum mechanics compared to
[04:55.040 --> 04:59.160]  things like yo teach I'll explain we get back and break down all the big news
[04:59.160 --> 05:03.400]  stay with us this is Alex Jones I want to tell you again about a company that

[06:13.560 --> 06:18.680]  well-funded the Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is
[06:18.680 --> 06:22.440]  working for the best interest of the American people while Obama's already
[06:22.440 --> 06:27.080]  fudging yeah but since day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a
[06:27.080 --> 06:31.760]  fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of
[06:31.760 --> 06:37.800]  a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism it's not about
[06:37.800 --> 06:42.280]  left or right it's about a one-world government this film documents who

[07:08.680 --> 07:12.440]  taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for
[07:12.440 --> 07:16.240]  someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day there is no
[07:16.240 --> 07:21.000]  job security you are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.200]  of your livelihood and own your own business since you are the boss nobody
[07:25.200 --> 07:30.000]  can fire you so MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is
[07:30.000 --> 07:34.440]  passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for

[08:01.200 --> 08:07.040]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[08:07.040 --> 08:13.640]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:15.080 --> 08:20.160]  we are going to break down what's happening in Iran today what's going on
[08:20.160 --> 08:26.520]  in Pakistan North Korea it's as if someone flipped a light switch in
[08:26.520 --> 08:34.600]  global crises are blowing up across the planet
[08:35.280 --> 08:39.800]  North Korea is threatening to nuke South Korea or Japan if anyone stops their
[08:39.800 --> 08:44.640]  ships this is as great an escalation as the Cuban the Cuban missile
[08:44.640 --> 08:53.080]  crisis Hillary Clinton says they're going to start boarding the North Korean
[08:53.080 --> 08:59.680]  ships the White House says China is behind it and supports it but when you
[08:59.680 --> 09:05.440]  actually read what the Chinese ambassador to the UN has said he said do
[09:05.440 --> 09:10.400]  not attack and do not engage in provocation with the North Koreans they've
[09:10.400 --> 09:16.720]  also told the North Koreans to not engage in provocations so more lies by the
[09:16.720 --> 09:24.880]  media China does not support what's going on and the average dumb-down person
[09:24.880 --> 09:28.960]  out there is tuning in for the first time a mainline liberal or a mainline fake
[09:28.960 --> 09:33.840]  conservative will think oh what are you for North Korea no I'm not for North
[09:33.840 --> 09:39.920]  Korea I'm not for Donald Rumsfeld in the mid-1990s as the chairman of ABB the
[09:39.920 --> 09:46.400]  Swiss nuke company transferring the nuclear reactors to North Korea so they
[09:46.400 --> 09:50.040]  could build their atomic weapons
[09:52.080 --> 09:57.440]  no I don't like the fact that the US British and Israeli governments armed
[09:57.440 --> 10:02.880]  through a Qcon laboratories Pakistan and then you should ask the question why
[10:02.880 --> 10:07.560]  are they passing nukes out why are they handing out nuclear weapons like party
[10:07.560 --> 10:13.960]  favors at a six-year-old's birthday party to every little third-world backwash
[10:13.960 --> 10:16.400]  nation
[10:18.840 --> 10:24.960]  why and then you'll understand what surrogate states are and how they
[10:24.960 --> 10:34.080]  plan to destabilize India and China with Pakistan Afghanistan North Korea
[10:34.080 --> 10:40.520]  situation and Japan and how Russia is being destabilized and circled by
[10:40.520 --> 10:50.400]  Poland Ukraine Czech Republic Georgia and other client states of NATO it's a
[10:50.400 --> 10:56.800]  fact right as Kim Jong-il is about to transfer power to a shine dying of cancer
[10:56.800 --> 11:02.280]  dying of multiple strokes now admitting he's on death's doorstep probably dead
[11:02.280 --> 11:08.240]  in the next year once you can hang on by his fingernails with like Fidel Castro
[11:08.240 --> 11:11.520]  it's amazing what you can do with a government medical care at the highest
[11:11.520 --> 11:23.560]  levels with top physicians attending to you right when his 20-something-year-old
[11:23.560 --> 11:29.360]  punk son is about to get power right when the state is its most dangerous and
[11:29.360 --> 11:36.480]  volatile they say they're gonna start searching their ships for WMD's or any
[11:36.480 --> 11:42.760]  weapons artillery machine guns they say you can't sell that to anybody when it's
[11:42.760 --> 11:48.520]  the only export they've got to buy the fuel oil and grain so their inner party
[11:48.520 --> 11:54.400]  can still pig out on Colby beef and so their population millions of which have
[11:54.400 --> 11:59.520]  died in the last decade of starvation and have some chance of living I don't
[11:59.520 --> 12:03.480]  want to hear about how we got to have World War three with North Korea because
[12:03.480 --> 12:09.360]  they might be shipping out artillery give me a break when the new world order
[12:09.360 --> 12:15.240]  gave them the frickin nukes now stick that in your fake conservative you think
[12:15.240 --> 12:19.000]  it's a manly to be a warmonger when you can't even find the stupid country on a
[12:19.000 --> 12:24.800]  map you think driving around and flexing your muscles and wearing shirts with big
[12:24.800 --> 12:29.800]  skulls on it and black bandanas is tough but you won't learn about the
[12:29.800 --> 12:33.160]  Bill of Rights and Constitution now our nation's been hijacked by foreign
[12:33.160 --> 12:39.000]  bankers we're trying to start World War three World War three is a political
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.280]  diversion while they steal everything we've got everything that is nailed down
[12:43.280 --> 12:48.120]  and isn't nailed down and I'm not knocking somebody with big muscles
[12:48.120 --> 12:54.600]  wearing black t-shirts with skulls and bandanas on their heads just everywhere
[12:54.600 --> 13:03.840]  I go I see those type guys at Academy I was buying some ammo last night or when
[13:03.840 --> 13:10.360]  I ran into a cafeteria I saw these big warrior type men everywhere some guy
[13:10.360 --> 13:15.960]  was jig giant muscles black bandana big black shirt with a skull on it in there
[13:15.960 --> 13:20.360]  with his wife and kids and I guarantee you that got urinate Oliver's leg of the
[13:20.360 --> 13:24.520]  cops pulled him over and told him to get on the ground I guarantee you that guy
[13:24.520 --> 13:28.840]  hidden down at the legislature trying to fight bills where the government can
[13:28.840 --> 13:35.760]  kidnap his children without even having a fourth amendment or a judge's order and
[13:35.760 --> 13:43.040]  I just want to ask you if you're such a man outside of watching ice truckers and
[13:43.040 --> 13:50.360]  playing with yourself why don't you stand up and be a real man why don't you
[13:50.360 --> 13:54.600]  stand up and defend the Republic as it's falling instead of having some vague
[13:54.600 --> 14:00.840]  thing about Apache helicopters shooting hellfire missiles into brown people's
[14:00.840 --> 14:06.200]  houses that's your idea manhood just some vague idea of aircraft carriers and
[14:06.200 --> 14:13.120]  missile cruisers launching tomahawks down people's chimneys that isn't manhood
[14:13.120 --> 14:20.120]  jackass manhood is taking care of your family in the country where you live you
[14:20.120 --> 14:23.720]  understand a scientific dictatorship has taken over all the farms and ranches
[14:23.720 --> 14:27.080]  they're seizing all the major industries they're shutting the United
[14:27.080 --> 14:37.640]  States off like you take an old man off life support get your head in gear get
[14:37.640 --> 14:43.320]  your guts in gear and get your brain in gear and all you guys in your cowboy hat
[14:43.320 --> 14:47.400]  strutting around your wranglers acting tough I mean I sit there watching men of
[14:47.400 --> 14:52.480]  America strut around like peacocks bugging their eyes out at people bugging
[14:52.480 --> 15:00.960]  their eyes out at some Leo little old man or something walk into the bathroom
[15:00.960 --> 15:04.840]  in a restaurant but you won't stand up for the Bellarites and Constitution
[15:04.840 --> 15:10.280]  you'll stick American flags made in China by Chinese slaves all over your car
[15:10.280 --> 15:20.160]  you like the idea of freedom but your idea of freedom is tyranny I don't mean
[15:20.160 --> 15:26.400]  to get off into that I just where are the men you know they have the rot rally
[15:26.400 --> 15:29.880]  here in Austin and you couldn't hardly go anywhere this Friday Saturday Sunday
[15:29.880 --> 15:33.560]  because of people driving around bugging their eyes out at people acting
[15:33.560 --> 15:38.160]  tough on motorcycles and I'm not saying you're bad to want to be on a motorcycle
[15:38.160 --> 15:43.920]  I've had motorcycles like motorcycles back when I was young and didn't care
[15:43.920 --> 15:48.080]  about dying before I found out I wasn't bulletproof now I've got important work
[15:48.080 --> 15:53.880]  to do so I don't have a motorcycle I want to risk my life I'll only spend my
[15:53.880 --> 15:58.320]  life on something worthy and I know it's fun to wear skull shirts and I what's
[15:58.320 --> 16:03.240]  fun to drive around acting tough and putting on the trappings of a modern
[16:03.240 --> 16:09.600]  day pirate it that's what you do and wearing the iron cross but you know what
[16:09.600 --> 16:13.240]  the iron cross why you like that symbol of dark power because it meant
[16:13.240 --> 16:21.000]  millions dead for machine gun bullets and nerve gas that dark symbol has power
[16:21.000 --> 16:29.160]  because it is the totem of giant piles of dead bodies and burnout cities and
[16:29.160 --> 16:33.840]  artillery being fired at point blank range into
[16:33.840 --> 16:43.480]  cowering masses as buildings collapse on them pictured a dead two-year-old little
[16:43.480 --> 16:48.120]  blonde-haired girl with her lower half blown off still clutching a teddy bear
[16:48.120 --> 16:53.960]  in her arms worms crawling in and out of her ears and nose and mouth and smell
[16:53.960 --> 17:00.640]  the dead flesh and then tell me you like the dark power of the iron cross you
[17:00.640 --> 17:08.880]  don't know anything about the iron cross or the gates of hell you don't know
[17:08.880 --> 17:13.760]  anything about the stench of dead children but it will soon be in your
[17:13.760 --> 17:22.480]  nostrils if you continue to conjure hell and death you hear the howl and the
[17:22.480 --> 17:29.120]  grind of the gears of death and you think it makes a beautiful sound from far
[17:29.120 --> 17:37.480]  away and it does have a black majesty a dark majesty like the smoke stacks of
[17:37.480 --> 17:45.920]  Hades but once you've been delivered to the lands of the four horses you will
[17:45.920 --> 17:57.200]  no longer love the darkness you grasp at the darkness because you are weak and
[17:57.200 --> 18:02.640]  because subconsciously you fear it so you think by embracing it it gives you
[18:02.640 --> 18:13.080]  power over it you have no power over darkness in darkness the only power over
[18:13.080 --> 18:20.600]  darkness is the light and not the counterfeit of the light the loving
[18:20.600 --> 18:27.880]  limp-rusted dove of the liberals the fake oozing death yet nothing but another
[18:27.880 --> 18:34.560]  vehicle of the true darkness no one must find the true light not its many
[18:34.560 --> 18:41.960]  counterfeits not the velvet gloved eugenicist who loves the black who loves
[18:41.960 --> 18:50.240]  the brown who loves you and saddles up to you the true darkness rarely
[18:50.240 --> 19:06.320]  festoons itself in its true cloak of iron and fire it wears that of a sheep and
[19:06.320 --> 19:16.080]  it baws sweetly in your ear for the carbon texas and helping the children
[19:16.080 --> 19:26.280]  and it whispers in your ears spells that turn your bones to jelly and your
[19:26.280 --> 19:44.840]  heart to weak shivering cold I will break down the news that we have before us on
[19:44.840 --> 19:54.320]  the other side of this transmission on the other side of these ads those
[19:54.320 --> 20:03.920]  merchants that fund our vessels heart disease is on the rise clogged arteries

[20:12.960 --> 20:17.080]  circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you
[20:17.080 --> 20:21.560]  that something is wrong here how heart and body extract is making a difference

[25:55.160 --> 26:01.560]  that's coming up David I can the third and fourth hour today I'm gonna talk
[26:01.560 --> 26:05.720]  about this coming up later in the hour this is the huge announcement it's
[26:05.720 --> 26:10.400]  just so important so many things clicked when I saw this last night things I'd
[26:10.400 --> 26:14.080]  already known things I talked about many many times but never articulated
[26:14.080 --> 26:17.320]  fully things I thought about a million times everything you'd thought about
[26:17.320 --> 26:23.920]  to we're all thinking the same thing here that we're in way over our heads but
[26:23.920 --> 26:30.000]  we don't have a choice but to fight on corporate media cyber bullying propaganda
[26:30.000 --> 26:34.280]  get into that roundup hate speech promoters this is being announced all
[26:34.280 --> 26:40.080]  over national news they're just saying arrest anybody that criticizes the
[26:40.080 --> 26:44.240]  government and of the three or four names they throw around guess who is in
[26:44.240 --> 26:55.600]  the mix Alex Jones I don't agree with the classic people that are singled out
[26:55.600 --> 27:00.720]  for hate crime and hate speech and thought crime and pre-crime but I've
[27:00.720 --> 27:07.320]  also been very careful not to step on those landmines as well because I don't
[27:07.320 --> 27:11.760]  want to be associated with the nest of government operatives in their foolish
[27:11.760 --> 27:17.400]  cohorts who don't know they're being led along to the slaughter so we'll talk
[27:17.400 --> 27:22.080]  about that also JP Morgan hire super tanker for storage brokers say I had this
[27:22.080 --> 27:26.520]  land on my desk a week ago never got to it I was cleaning off my desk and saw it
[27:26.520 --> 27:33.840]  this is just a nice microcosm example of the unbelievable corruption Bloomberg
[27:33.840 --> 27:41.760]  admits that JP Morgan like last summer is buying giant leasing giant triple
[27:41.760 --> 27:48.040]  hole super tankers filling them full of heating oil and crude oil and in some
[27:48.040 --> 27:59.520]  cases gasoline even more refined and expensive and they are parking them off
[27:59.520 --> 28:10.640]  Malta and other islands in the med to artificially bid up the price and jack
[28:10.640 --> 28:21.480]  up the price there there there there's a huge glut of oil too much oil that's on
[28:21.480 --> 28:24.520]  the markets the price was plunging to down to thirty two dollars a barrel and
[28:24.520 --> 28:28.400]  so JP Morgan takes the trillions of dollars pumped in the brokerage firms
[28:28.400 --> 28:37.160]  and private banks they take your tax money and they put it in to oil and
[28:37.160 --> 28:43.880]  other commodities they hoard it but drives at the price you pay for it with
[28:43.880 --> 28:50.840]  your tax money and then it's another direct tax to them in that you will pay
[28:50.840 --> 28:59.080]  more in the gas that they've speculated and driven up and then they'll jump on
[28:59.080 --> 29:05.120]  the market after bidding it up and make even bigger profits and that's just one
[29:05.120 --> 29:09.400]  little way they rape us in this rigged fake economy this is not free market
[29:09.400 --> 29:15.000]  and it's not socialism it's a pirate economy it's a predator economy it's a
[29:15.000 --> 29:24.920]  joke economy but I mentioned that headline judgment day broke California

[33:22.680 --> 33:29.480]  you know I say I've got this big revelation for everybody right now but
[33:29.480 --> 33:36.200]  the revelation is that we don't know how right we've really been when we sit
[33:36.200 --> 33:42.480]  around saying it's like the public's on drugs they're dumbed down it's like
[33:42.480 --> 33:50.920]  they're in a trance they can't wake up they are and a lot goes into this cocktail
[33:50.920 --> 33:59.760]  but when I saw this last night it hit me like a thunderbolt and so I ran in and
[33:59.760 --> 34:05.560]  about midnight and I turned on television and I began flipping around
[34:05.560 --> 34:12.120]  trying to find newer sitcoms newer shows newer dramas and I did find those on the
[34:12.120 --> 34:18.880]  children's and I'm sorry folks just walked in with a message hold on hold on
[34:18.880 --> 34:46.600]  just a moment I'm not that happens more and more I had some folks
[34:46.600 --> 35:01.160]  come in and talk to me but if you watch television you notice and you see that
[35:01.160 --> 35:08.760]  they are dumbing the language down more and more and more and more and more and
[35:08.760 --> 35:21.560]  more and more and then when you talk to the general public they are almost
[35:21.560 --> 35:35.760]  unable to even form intelligible sentences and I wrote a bunch of notes
[35:35.760 --> 35:39.200]  on this last night and then got distracted right before I left my house and
[35:39.200 --> 35:42.120]  didn't bring them down here so I'm gonna get into that with David I coming up
[35:42.120 --> 35:47.880]  when he's on the show with us today and this whole Iran situation in the North
[35:47.880 --> 35:53.840]  Korea situation there's just no end to it and the Rand Corporation is on record
[35:53.840 --> 35:57.480]  saying they want to get World War three going so they can help bring in the New
[35:57.480 --> 36:05.240]  World Order they need this global crisis to offer the global solution and I'm
[36:05.240 --> 36:08.520]  just so sick of the globalist and all the criminal activity they're carrying
[36:08.520 --> 36:22.000]  out but before I get into all of that today I want to first play this clip
[36:22.000 --> 36:27.080]  from Anderson Cooper on CNN
[36:27.080 --> 36:37.360]  Anderson Cooper who when I get up on air and I say he's CIA he admits he was
[36:37.360 --> 36:41.600]  recruited by the CIA out of college but then says he didn't like it and went into
[36:41.600 --> 36:47.240]  media and there's even mainstream news articles where they report on themselves
[36:47.240 --> 36:51.440]  like it's no big deal and just acclimate everybody we've got some of those up on
[36:51.440 --> 36:57.400]  fullwars.com today there's an article how the spooks took over the media and they
[36:57.400 --> 37:05.000]  just brag that they run CNN and Fox and MSNBC and they always have to a
[37:05.000 --> 37:10.480]  certain extent the producers and the editors and the heads of the TV companies
[37:10.480 --> 37:19.480]  but now now it's just right out in the open but the general public doesn't know
[37:19.480 --> 37:27.560]  that you know George Arwell worked at the BBC in propaganda BBC is government
[37:27.560 --> 37:34.960]  and is propaganda but it has to pose as a fake conservative fake liberal amalgamation
[37:34.960 --> 37:40.760]  of egalitarian compassion when really it's a bunch of cold-blooded control
[37:40.760 --> 37:44.760]  free criminal eugenicists who rationalize all the terrible things they do
[37:44.760 --> 37:50.480]  because they're carrying out eugenics against the population but yesterday on
[37:50.480 --> 37:53.120]  the Sunday show I didn't have time to get into much of this but I want to now
[37:53.120 --> 37:59.400]  the gangster government now we've certainly always had corruption in the
[37:59.400 --> 38:04.040]  state and the state's not perfect and the state more often than not 99% of the
[38:04.040 --> 38:08.160]  time goes rogue and criminal and abuses the people that's why you've got to have
[38:08.160 --> 38:12.640]  a rule of law and tie the hands of the state and it's better that 10 guilty men
[38:12.640 --> 38:17.440]  go free than one innocent man be imprisoned but now I've heard prosecutors
[38:17.440 --> 38:21.440]  and federal judges say man better some innocent people go to jail than
[38:21.440 --> 38:26.920]  criminals go loose ah you would expect a criminal to talk like that and oh torture
[38:26.920 --> 38:31.080]  is good if the good guys do it and oh secret arrest is good it's only for
[38:31.080 --> 38:38.960]  foreigners and now citizens and warrantless wiretapping is good and
[38:38.960 --> 38:47.200]  we're gonna do it to citizens been doing it but I told a story briefly to the
[38:47.200 --> 38:50.560]  show yesterday I ran out of time of me and one of my friends had been at the
[38:50.560 --> 38:56.280]  beach when I was still in high school like I was only 16 my body was a 17 we
[38:56.280 --> 39:00.600]  been down vision and friends at the Texas beach and we were driving back to
[39:00.600 --> 39:10.760]  Dallas on I-45 and a local cop some little town pulls us over and he wants
[39:10.760 --> 39:16.160]  to search the car and my buddy Mark it was actually Mark did it I just played
[39:16.160 --> 39:25.840]  along had a big swastika right on his forearm and Mark said oh nice tattoo
[39:25.840 --> 39:31.800]  kind of in a smart mouth way the guys ago you like it and did a little a little
[39:31.800 --> 39:36.320]  howl Hitler to us and we just kind of looked at him and smiled me let us go I
[39:36.320 --> 39:41.160]  guess he thought we were with him and I found in a lot of these cases the reason
[39:41.160 --> 39:47.960]  I bring that up is if you're black or Hispanic they're gonna take your car
[39:47.960 --> 39:52.160]  take your money take everything you got and it's on national news now in South
[39:52.160 --> 39:58.720]  Texas well in El Senizo and scores of other old towns the Mexican flag is
[39:58.720 --> 40:03.480]  flown at the city halls this is I told you about this in 1998 it's now been on
[40:03.480 --> 40:09.600]  mainstream news whitewashing it though and if you're a gringo and you come in
[40:09.600 --> 40:13.600]  those towns it's just like going to Mexico and you're a dumb gringo where
[40:13.600 --> 40:16.520]  they take your car and shake you down and put you in prison and run your credit
[40:16.520 --> 40:22.120]  line and have your family pay $20,000 to get you out of Mexico so my
[40:22.120 --> 40:26.080]  point is this is what any predator group does they always say oh we're only
[40:26.080 --> 40:30.200]  predators if we're white on the blacks and Mexicans and then if you're Mexican
[40:30.200 --> 40:35.240]  you're only a predator on the blacks and the whites and that's how the
[40:35.240 --> 40:39.480]  criminality always works or in the south oh you're a Yankee we're gonna take what
[40:39.480 --> 40:43.320]  you got and beat you up or if you're in the north you shouldn't be up here in
[40:43.320 --> 40:49.080]  New Jersey with Texas plates see it's always done to the outsider and the
[40:49.080 --> 40:52.080]  tyrants know how to do this oh we're only taking the rights of the brown
[40:52.080 --> 41:00.520]  Muslims of the Iraqis of the Afghans and they know how your primitive mindset
[41:00.520 --> 41:06.640]  works the tribalism it's all carried out scientifically but when the feds come
[41:06.640 --> 41:12.840]  out Anderson CIA Cooper and does report after report week after week of
[41:12.840 --> 41:18.600]  different Texas towns and they still even kind of whitewash it folks they
[41:18.600 --> 41:22.000]  pull over old ladies and grab 3,000 out of their wallet take their watch take
[41:22.000 --> 41:27.320]  their earrings take their car put them in jail for a week and say sign this
[41:27.320 --> 41:30.120]  form saying you won't sue and won't contest or we're gonna go ahead and
[41:30.120 --> 41:35.680]  charge you with drug dealing and the feds do it whenever you know I remember
[41:35.680 --> 41:40.480]  I've seen 60 minute shows about how how people try to get on an airplane and
[41:40.480 --> 41:46.160]  they see him pay with cash and then they search their bags and find $10,000 and
[41:46.160 --> 41:49.880]  the guy goes yeah I got you know one case of a guy in North Carolina he flies to
[41:49.880 --> 41:55.520]  Houston every year to pay for the freight shipments but to pick the trees as a
[41:55.520 --> 42:00.560]  landscape company owner that he's gonna have shipped about 18 wheeler all the
[42:00.560 --> 42:05.000]  way to the Carolinas I remember that case because we interviewed him saw it on
[42:05.000 --> 42:09.480]  60 minutes and I had him on probably 12 years ago and they don't care no judge
[42:09.480 --> 42:13.640]  no jury they just grab them they just grab the 10 grand out of his briefcase
[42:13.640 --> 42:17.400]  and they don't care if there's tax records of it they don't carry owns the
[42:17.400 --> 42:21.080]  business and they don't carry as receipts listen you're a slave and we're
[42:21.080 --> 42:26.080]  taking it and that ticket taker up there gets a bigger paycheck every year from
[42:26.080 --> 42:34.640]  the government than they do for running the ticket counter so my point is the
[42:34.640 --> 42:45.040]  hoity-toity New York CIA Astor boy heir to the Astor fortune Anderson Cooper he
[42:45.040 --> 42:56.280]  likes to make it all about how it's us buck-toothed redneck tobacco shoe and
[42:56.280 --> 43:00.800]  Texans that shake people down yeah like the cops don't shake people down in
[43:00.800 --> 43:06.600]  New York City like the cops don't shake people down all over that state like you
[43:06.600 --> 43:16.280]  don't have your own brand of hillbilly the issue is this is going on everywhere
[43:16.280 --> 43:20.240]  the Russians love to point out our corruption we love to point out theirs
[43:20.240 --> 43:24.160]  it's always nice to point at somebody else to say that's a bad man when evil
[43:24.160 --> 43:28.400]  is pandemic across the globe and it starts in our hearts and our minds and
[43:28.400 --> 43:32.360]  fixing it is about changing ourselves one person at a time because you get
[43:32.360 --> 43:36.440]  yourself right with God you get yourself right morally you're not going to
[43:36.440 --> 43:40.600]  believe these 501c3 whore churches you're gonna know you got to be out fighting
[43:40.600 --> 43:48.880]  corruption it's gonna compel you instead the fake spirit of Christianity in the
[43:48.880 --> 43:52.600]  churches today tells folks to lay down to it anyways I wanted to play this clip
[43:52.600 --> 43:58.160]  of a whitewash this is a town right outside Austin and they don't just grab
[43:58.160 --> 44:04.360]  the blacks and the Hispanics stuff they like grabbing your college kids and they
[44:04.360 --> 44:08.960]  like you know they catch a college kid with half a marijuana cigarette that
[44:08.960 --> 44:15.040]  big brand-new Chevy Tahoe daddy bought junior is gone and the three thousand
[44:15.040 --> 44:20.880]  dollars is gone and the juniors caught with pills everything's taken a lot of
[44:20.880 --> 44:23.720]  times the cops just keep it for themselves and don't even enroll it and
[44:23.720 --> 44:27.720]  the judges take the money for themselves let's go ahead and play this piece here
[44:27.720 --> 44:31.200]  it is report takes us back to the heart of Texas where Gary Tuckman has found
[44:31.200 --> 44:36.040]  another county awash in both cash and allegations of corruption the money more
[44:36.040 --> 44:39.080]  than a million dollars last year was seized from drivers who were pulled over
[44:39.080 --> 44:43.440]  by cops their allegations that some of those drivers were innocent so what's
[44:43.440 --> 44:46.920]  happening to all that money well that's where so many people that's why so many
[44:46.920 --> 44:52.200]  people are steamed Gary Tuckman tonight is keeping him on the dusty roads here in
[44:52.200 --> 44:56.480]  Texas Hill country have been a goldmine for police and prosecutors but some
[44:56.480 --> 45:02.080]  defense attorneys call it the best little ripoff in Texas it makes Texans
[45:02.080 --> 45:05.760]  look like buffoons and it makes it look like all of our judges and police
[45:05.760 --> 45:10.160]  officers are croaks down here in Texas and other states cops can pull over
[45:10.160 --> 45:13.960]  drivers suspected of serious crimes and they can actually seize their cash and
[45:13.960 --> 45:18.560]  valuables four times the former DA here spent tens of thousands of it for all
[45:18.560 --> 45:23.040]  expense paid trips to Hawaii for himself some of his staff and spouses do you
[45:23.040 --> 45:26.720]  think it was okay to spend that money to go to Hawaii absolutely why do you think
[45:26.720 --> 45:30.840]  that well it's part of the United States last time I checked and we have
[45:30.840 --> 45:34.520]  conferences all over the other state was a difference in a while the organizers
[45:34.520 --> 45:40.120]  of the annual trip to this resort in Oahu invite spouses sweeties friends the
[45:40.120 --> 45:44.120]  trip doesn't include 10 hours of law seminars 10 hours out of an entire week
[45:44.120 --> 45:49.400]  the rest of the time is for Sun Golf and luau's the price 4,000 bucks a couple
[45:49.400 --> 45:53.320]  steep but not what it's paid for by public money made back home on the
[45:53.320 --> 45:57.680]  highway Ron Sutton was the district attorney here for 32 years he didn't
[45:57.680 --> 46:01.240]  run again this fall they still working part-time in the DA's office but could
[46:01.240 --> 46:04.640]  you understand sir how it kind of looks bad to people that are going to Hawaii
[46:04.640 --> 46:07.840]  four times only to those people who are jealous because they haven't been
[46:07.840 --> 46:11.680]  Hawaii the money used by the former DA came from the Texas forfeiture law
[46:11.680 --> 46:15.880]  district attorneys offices get a cut of the seizure money and are allowed to use
[46:15.880 --> 46:20.920]  the cash for quote official purposes which the former DA says is anything
[46:20.920 --> 46:24.400]  used in connection with promoting and functioning of the office or training
[46:24.400 --> 46:29.360]  could be anything it's outrageous Texas State Senator John Whitmire says the
[46:29.360 --> 46:35.440]  forfeiture law often leads to corruption the law that I am going to change is so
[46:35.440 --> 46:40.360]  general that they they can literally get away with stealing in my mind the
[46:40.360 --> 46:44.520]  purpose of forfeiture is to strip real criminals of ill-gotten gains although in
[46:44.520 --> 46:48.480]  Texas there have been many accusations that innocent people often minorities are
[46:48.480 --> 46:52.560]  targeted and pull over deputies told this man he was driving too long in the
[46:52.560 --> 47:02.800]  passing lane it got violent the driver a Latino and a US Navy veteran was
[47:02.800 --> 47:06.440]  charged with endangering police after his lawyer got his hands on this video
[47:06.440 --> 47:12.360]  charges were dropped it was a like a probably a classic profile stop this is
[47:12.360 --> 47:16.520]  the Kimball County seat of Junction Texas there are only four thousand four
[47:16.520 --> 47:20.400]  hundred people who live in this entire county this is Main Street you can see
[47:20.400 --> 47:24.040]  it's a quiet sleepy place but the Sheriff's Department deputies here are
[47:24.040 --> 47:29.000]  very active and busy getting forfeiture money is a very important industry here
[47:29.000 --> 47:32.960]  how important the sheriff's office keeps more than an average of one million
[47:32.960 --> 47:36.640]  dollars annually in forfeitures the former DA says he had more than one
[47:36.640 --> 47:40.160]  million dollars in his account when he left office he says Hawaii wasn't a
[47:40.160 --> 47:44.200]  vacation but a way to learn and get legal credits but beyond paying for
[47:44.200 --> 47:48.040]  airfares and hotel rooms they're spending money for the group here's a check
[47:48.040 --> 47:51.720]  paid to cash for six thousand dollars to cover the week why do you guys need six
[47:51.720 --> 47:57.800]  thousand dollars well you go to Hawaii you'll see why a hamburger drinks $20 but
[47:57.800 --> 48:01.680]  what really got our attention was this the former DA says that one year he took
[48:01.680 --> 48:07.400]  this man to Hawaii a meal pro he's the judge who hears forfeiture cases but
[48:07.400 --> 48:10.480]  wouldn't have been better to say judge you can't come with us to Hawaii because
[48:10.480 --> 48:13.600]  we're using forfeiture money but that issue has never come up until right now
[48:13.600 --> 48:17.480]  okay so what's your answer the interest items anything wrong with it it's help
[48:17.480 --> 48:21.840]  educating the judge and what about this our search through the public record shows
[48:21.840 --> 48:25.720]  checks written directly to the judge here's one for three thousand dollars
[48:25.720 --> 48:30.160]  four thousand forty five hundred dollars why were checks written directly to the
[48:30.160 --> 48:33.680]  judge from the forfeiture account coverage expenses and conferences and see
[48:33.680 --> 48:36.800]  how taxpayers might say you know a little more documentation would be nice
[48:36.800 --> 48:41.880]  here well no retrospect maybe so who would I know I did nothing wrong my
[48:41.880 --> 48:45.000]  conscience is clear we asked for an interview with the judge but we're
[48:45.000 --> 48:48.720]  told he did not want to talk but we needed his side of the story so we
[48:48.720 --> 48:51.200]  caught up with them outside the courthouse to ask about his Hawaii
[48:51.200 --> 48:54.520]  trip you know I'm really not able to comment on that at this point I
[48:54.520 --> 48:58.640]  appreciate your interest some point I hope I can but at this point I can but
[48:58.640 --> 49:03.920]  I appreciate your interest how come you can't comment about it there there's
[49:03.920 --> 49:08.360]  just issues I've got four for your case is still pending and I can't so that's
[49:08.360 --> 49:11.760]  what I'm talking about is could you hear the forfeiture cases but that's the
[49:11.760 --> 49:16.400]  issue and we're dealing with that issue there is a new da here in Texas Hill
[49:16.400 --> 49:22.960]  Country he says there will be no more trips to Hawaii so like to carry let me
[49:22.960 --> 49:25.600]  just got a couple questions let me just get this straight though the judge who's
[49:25.600 --> 49:31.120]  hearing the forfeiture cases is getting cash money from the forfeiture cases
[49:31.120 --> 49:35.800]  right he's gotten expenses for at least one Hawaii trip and he's also gotten
[49:35.800 --> 49:39.840]  cash money to according to the old district attorney to attend conferences
[49:39.840 --> 49:44.120]  but it's not really well documented to say the least in the state center told
[49:44.120 --> 49:47.000]  you that you want to toughen the forfeiture law what's the situation
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.920]  without it is that happening well we've done three stories now and these
[49:50.920 --> 49:53.680]  forfeiture laws in Texas since we started doing the stories the state
[49:53.680 --> 49:58.120]  Senate voted unanimously for tougher laws a house committee voted unanimously for
[49:58.120 --> 50:02.280]  tougher laws expected the governor would sign the bill but then the full house
[50:02.280 --> 50:06.480]  dithered and dathered never got around to it the legislative session ended
[50:06.480 --> 50:10.480]  last week and here's the kicker Texas only meet the legislature every two
[50:10.480 --> 50:16.360]  years so a new law now can't be passed until 2011 and just in case viewers think
[50:16.360 --> 50:19.840]  oh I saw this story already you did this couple weeks ago this is an entirely
[50:19.840 --> 50:23.200]  different town than the other place where they were taking money from drivers
[50:23.200 --> 50:26.920]  and and not giving it back when those drivers turned out to be innocent of
[50:26.920 --> 50:31.480]  anything let's make it clear there's a lot of counties in Texas where there are
[50:31.480 --> 50:35.240]  no allegations whatsoever but we have found it so far at least three where
[50:35.240 --> 50:39.360]  there are substantial allegations of alleged improprieties involving this
[50:39.360 --> 50:42.560]  forfeiture account are you a little nervous driving through some of these
[50:42.560 --> 50:46.360]  counties in Texas Gary I hope you have people with you all right that's enough
[50:46.360 --> 50:51.800]  that's about federalizing all the police so they can carry out their corruption
[50:51.800 --> 50:56.360]  more scientifically we'll be right back finish breaking it down I'll continue
[50:56.360 --> 51:00.520]  the series as we look at gangster government

[54:35.200 --> 54:44.960]  boss hog backwards knuckle dragon Texans when that stuff goes on all over the
[54:44.960 --> 54:52.320]  country but they do it on Texas every single week and it is true the police in
[54:52.320 --> 54:58.400]  Oklahoma Texas other southern and western cities literally are treated
[54:58.400 --> 55:06.080]  like God this is the public is nice and friendly and puts up with anything and so
[55:06.080 --> 55:10.520]  the cops aren't thinking it's normal they will go on TV and say we took the old
[55:10.520 --> 55:16.840]  woman's $4,000 and I spent it on my house what's wrong with that I'm a I'm a
[55:16.840 --> 55:24.600]  DA and I'm allowed to have a little money honey and let me tell you people around
[55:24.600 --> 55:29.920]  here voted me in because I share the money with all of them you don't come
[55:29.920 --> 55:36.160]  through our town now boy sure that's going on but that expression of
[55:36.160 --> 55:41.200]  government out of control is going on a bigger scale at the federal level they're
[55:41.200 --> 55:45.680]  not stealing people's wallets they're stealing their entire future they're
[55:45.680 --> 55:54.840]  stealing GM and Chrysler now the feds encouraged in the 80s the passage of
[55:54.840 --> 55:59.400]  federal laws for asset forfeiture seizure the states would never allow
[55:59.400 --> 56:04.400]  previously the police to just grab your car or house without even charging you
[56:04.400 --> 56:09.440]  no drugs are found all over Florida Texas California some of the worst
[56:09.440 --> 56:13.720]  are famous cases of where counties in California would want to buy somebody's
[56:13.720 --> 56:18.560]  hundred acres of beautiful Canyon land worth tens of millions family land they
[56:18.560 --> 56:23.040]  wouldn't sell it police would just come gun the family down I could list all
[56:23.040 --> 56:26.600]  those cases fact Matt as hell actually covers at the air and so film we carry
[56:26.600 --> 56:30.000]  one case they just came to his house and shot him right in the back and the cops
[56:30.000 --> 56:35.600]  moved into it and sold it for themselves and there are corrupt counties in Texas
[56:35.600 --> 56:40.720]  where they will murder you for your land nice families will move into an area and
[56:40.720 --> 56:45.120]  the locals will come by and stop at the mailbox and go you better sell me this
[56:45.120 --> 56:51.040]  land for one penny on the dollar here's something bad's gonna happen you don't
[56:51.040 --> 56:54.280]  sell and they start pulling you over start beating you up burn your place
[56:54.280 --> 56:58.920]  down they'll gun you down because they've been doing it for generations and
[56:58.920 --> 57:06.000]  nobody's gonna stand up to them because we're a nation of cowards and that's
[57:06.000 --> 57:11.160]  what the feds do the feds will wrote the asset for which is seizure and then the
[57:11.160 --> 57:14.960]  states adopted through federal jurisdiction of the state seizure land
[57:14.960 --> 57:23.560]  or money under a federal operation in a federal joint JTF joint task force they
[57:23.560 --> 57:27.080]  get to keep 85% of the money if they do it at the state they only get to keep
[57:27.080 --> 57:32.600]  25% of the state law so see Anderson was telling you about the state seizures
[57:32.600 --> 57:36.560]  which don't hold the candle the feds that started it all the central
[57:36.560 --> 57:40.880]  intelligence agency you work for Anderson that ships the cocaine and heroin in

[1:00:19.720 --> 1:00:23.200]  Alex Jones
[1:00:35.720 --> 1:00:44.200]  there's a new satirical movie coming out put out by NBC making fun of sitcoms
[1:00:44.200 --> 1:00:47.680]  but it's really a sigh up it's not making fun of them this is exactly what
[1:00:47.680 --> 1:00:53.600]  they're like but it took the satire to really let me see from the few sitcoms
[1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:58.720]  I've the modern sitcoms I've witnessed how they've dumbed everything down that
[1:00:58.720 --> 1:01:02.080]  is coming up and I want to discuss the chemicalization the overall dumbing down
[1:01:02.080 --> 1:01:06.840]  the public because as stupid as these characters sound that's what the young
[1:01:06.840 --> 1:01:16.080]  people are like you try to talk to them they are about as smart as my dog so
[1:01:16.080 --> 1:01:19.680]  that's coming up also what's happening in Iran what's happening with North Korea
[1:01:19.680 --> 1:01:23.720]  all extremely important open phones later in the hour and we're gonna have
[1:01:23.720 --> 1:01:28.080]  David icon for two hours today that's always informative and interesting to get
[1:01:28.080 --> 1:01:35.000]  his perspective also two interesting articles a CNN I've been telling you
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:40.840]  this for years American al-Qaeda member acknowledges Jewish ancestry Adam
[1:01:40.840 --> 1:01:45.760]  Gadan also known as Azim the American yeah that's really what the Muslims call
[1:01:45.760 --> 1:01:49.680]  him Azim the American they always like chemical Ali oh Americans don't know
[1:01:49.680 --> 1:01:54.040]  the boogeymen in Iraq give them like comic book names like chemical Ali their
[1:01:54.040 --> 1:01:59.760]  little feeble brains can get that I mean how stupid do you like being treated
[1:01:59.760 --> 1:02:04.520]  he's the grandson of the former head of the ADL he got arrested repeatedly for
[1:02:04.520 --> 1:02:07.680]  beating up Muslims outside mosque I mean he hates Muslims that much
[1:02:07.680 --> 1:02:12.920]  rabid Zionist and then he becomes the head of al-Qaeda and then the Intel
[1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:17.560]  Center gets caught uploading his videos with the al-Qaeda watermark at the same
[1:02:17.560 --> 1:02:22.320]  video layer as the Intel Center and the Intel Center is publicly run by CIA
[1:02:22.320 --> 1:02:29.200]  former psych warfare experts under Rumsfeld publicly the CIA publicly this
[1:02:29.200 --> 1:02:38.080]  guy's probably in Miami but the public loves it they hate foreigners and so
[1:02:38.080 --> 1:02:48.320]  they'll don't understand the whole anti-terror apparatus is for them but
[1:02:48.320 --> 1:02:51.840]  I guess CNN's anti-Semitic for getting into that well no they're just spinning
[1:02:51.840 --> 1:02:56.480]  it because it's now popular knowledge of the solid that layer also an article by
[1:02:56.480 --> 1:03:04.800]  Ezra Levant Levin who's Jewish himself this is in the Ottawa citizen that's the
[1:03:04.800 --> 1:03:13.840]  in the capital of Canada big paper there and it says in 65 and 66 the Canadian
[1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:18.520]  Jewish Congress helped organize the fledgling Canadian Nazi Party that's why
[1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:23.680]  I'm attacked by the Nazis in the ADL don't like any of you guys that sounds
[1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:27.560]  crazy but it's true and I wrote about it in shakedown my new book about Canada's
[1:03:27.560 --> 1:03:32.920]  Human Rights Commissions which are meant to take everybody's free speech so it's
[1:03:32.920 --> 1:03:37.440]  the same thing it's been in the London Guardian that the major Nazi groups are
[1:03:37.440 --> 1:03:42.960]  run not not not infiltrated run and founded founded and run and the major
[1:03:42.960 --> 1:03:47.560]  clan groups are runned it are founded and run by the FBI and McVeigh was run
[1:03:47.560 --> 1:03:50.880]  out of Elohim City by the Southern Poverty Law Center that came out in
[1:03:50.880 --> 1:03:55.800]  declassified FBI documents Kurt Nemo posted this article but also did a blurb
[1:03:55.800 --> 1:04:04.920]  above it and added that added the declassified FBI document up there what
[1:04:04.920 --> 1:04:09.520]  happened is the FBI blacked one out in a lawsuit and another lawsuit they blacked
[1:04:09.520 --> 1:04:12.640]  out another part but with the two letters it was put together and you can
[1:04:12.640 --> 1:04:19.680]  see the basically the whole article oh god caught but hey Southern Poverty Law
[1:04:19.680 --> 1:04:23.840]  Center you got to have terrorists blowing up federal buildings or you can't

[1:08:20.520 --> 1:08:25.840]  top of it a bailout money and giving it to foreign corporations I mean just
[1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:32.680]  absolute robbery you are paying taxes to lose the company not paying taxes to
[1:08:32.680 --> 1:08:40.280]  prop it up so just crime on top of crime at levels number four scene that is
[1:08:40.280 --> 1:08:47.680]  coming up I want to get more into the CNN headline American al-Qaeda member
[1:08:47.680 --> 1:08:53.800]  acknowledges Jewish ancestry and then one out of the Ottawa citizen big paper
[1:08:53.800 --> 1:09:01.600]  in Canada creating anti-Semitism since 1965 Canadian Jewish Congress run by the
[1:09:01.600 --> 1:09:09.800]  Rothmans organize the fledgling Canadian Nazi party totally staged and I've been
[1:09:09.800 --> 1:09:14.800]  out to Nazi rallies to protest them in Austin we've shot video that showed it
[1:09:14.800 --> 1:09:19.920]  on TV and folks they're not Nazis and as far as there's a genetic type and we
[1:09:19.920 --> 1:09:23.680]  ought to dig those videos out and show it they were they were Jewish folks here
[1:09:23.680 --> 1:09:27.880]  in Austin I mean facts are facts and and it's being used to ban free speech in
[1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:32.480]  liberty in America and it's terrible and it's horrible but it's in the mainstream
[1:09:32.480 --> 1:09:38.400]  news and this is what false flag terrorism is are there real Nazis real
[1:09:38.400 --> 1:09:43.720]  white supremacists yes but now you wonder why I say was von Bruner under
[1:09:43.720 --> 1:09:51.480]  mind control he was under federal custody for six years in the 80s with a
[1:09:51.480 --> 1:09:56.760]  crazy box thing with fake dynamite and a gun that sounds fake then he pops back
[1:09:56.760 --> 1:10:01.880]  up and shoots this guard and he could be a real crazy but the issue here is you
[1:10:01.880 --> 1:10:05.560]  wonder why I say this could be an op look at the timing with the Federal Reserve
[1:10:05.560 --> 1:10:12.200]  about to be audited and the government wants to tar and feather the anti-
[1:10:12.200 --> 1:10:15.640]  Federal Reserve movements anti-Semitic one has nothing to do with that and they
[1:10:15.640 --> 1:10:19.960]  desperately want to do it they always have the Nazis sicked on me because I
[1:10:19.960 --> 1:10:25.160]  don't make it about religion or race and I know some of the groups that have
[1:10:25.160 --> 1:10:30.000]  been sicked on me are feds and it's come out they are feds and it's come out in
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:33.160]  the Orlando newspaper the you know the big Nazi rallies they have there were
[1:10:33.160 --> 1:10:36.960]  run by feds I mean German Nazis are started and run by feds the modern
[1:10:36.960 --> 1:10:40.200]  ones in the British I'm gonna break this down later we'll talk about it with
[1:10:40.200 --> 1:10:50.200]  David I but who gets caught in the middle Americans of all stripes Japanese
[1:10:50.200 --> 1:10:59.120]  Anglo-Saxon Jewish it's very sick listen I have a new sponsor I wanted to tell

[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:59.080]  the rest of the news information here I'm gonna play this clip first and then
[1:13:59.080 --> 1:14:05.320]  I'm gonna break down the full magnitude or at least closer to the full
[1:14:05.320 --> 1:14:09.600]  magnitude I mean the corruption is so incredible it's even hard to describe and
[1:14:09.600 --> 1:14:13.200]  what she's saying is what we've been talking about for months they plan three
[1:14:13.200 --> 1:14:17.920]  years ago that we knew of the hijacked Chrysler give it to billerberg group owned
[1:14:17.920 --> 1:14:29.320]  fiat to hijack GM as GM goes so goes the nation and hand it over to the
[1:14:29.320 --> 1:14:33.400]  Brazilians the Russians the Europeans the Chinese all the divisions that made
[1:14:33.400 --> 1:14:41.200]  money are being handed over to new private corporate owners and they're
[1:14:41.200 --> 1:14:47.320]  being paid billions of dollars a piece to take it and you understand that even
[1:14:47.320 --> 1:14:50.360]  under global law that we've signed on to criminally in the World Trade
[1:14:50.360 --> 1:14:53.920]  Organization they can't use the economic stimulus money or bailout money
[1:14:53.920 --> 1:15:00.160]  exclusively in the US so the argument is well you know the US per capita is
[1:15:00.160 --> 1:15:03.640]  only a small part of the world five percent of world population so the
[1:15:03.640 --> 1:15:07.080]  majority of the money the bailout money has to be spent outside the US they're
[1:15:07.080 --> 1:15:11.400]  not even allowed to use the bailout money and stimulus money domestically on
[1:15:11.400 --> 1:15:17.720]  only domestic projects that's the new world order just like the fourteen point
[1:15:17.720 --> 1:15:23.800]  eight trillion to go hedge all the markets drive up commodities and then you
[1:15:23.800 --> 1:15:28.400]  pay more in attacks of the bankers as a commodity and you pay to speculate and
[1:15:28.400 --> 1:15:33.520]  run up the price you see it's all about imploding society it's a risk clearing
[1:15:33.520 --> 1:15:38.000]  off all the other board pieces this is a game of chess folks we're being wiped
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:41.880]  out here these people aren't nice it's why they're in control so stop sucking
[1:15:41.880 --> 1:15:45.760]  your thumb and living in la la land they're gonna steal everything that is
[1:15:45.760 --> 1:15:51.200]  even nailed down including the kitchen sink everything they will implode
[1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:54.800]  everything and the fact you lay there being fooled by Obama and fooled by the
[1:15:54.800 --> 1:16:02.000]  republicans only encourages them this is economic warfare backed up by
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:09.600]  paramilitary force I mean if they're gonna let low if nobody can stop Texas and
[1:16:09.600 --> 1:16:13.800]  Alabama and Florida and Michigan cops randomly pulling over families and
[1:16:13.800 --> 1:16:17.880]  stealing their wallets they're not gonna be able to stop the bankers robbing
[1:16:17.880 --> 1:16:21.720]  everything till you get up off your fat butts and stop thinking that everything's
[1:16:21.720 --> 1:16:24.880]  okay I'm not talking to our general audience but the all the new stations
[1:16:24.880 --> 1:16:29.000]  picking us up and everybody tuning in listen to me I'm telling you the truth
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:33.360]  and you know it in your gut already and you know it intellectually we're not in
[1:16:33.360 --> 1:16:37.640]  Kansas anymore so get ready to go down the rabbit hole here but we don't have a
[1:16:37.640 --> 1:16:43.120]  prayer now let's play representative Michelle Bachman breaking it down and
[1:16:43.120 --> 1:16:47.440]  what she's saying is on record this is mafia government here it is so they
[1:16:47.440 --> 1:16:52.880]  could stay open that senator was able to arrange a meeting between the dealer
[1:16:52.880 --> 1:16:56.720]  and the officials at GM you know we have more time today back all the way to the
[1:16:56.720 --> 1:16:59.840]  start back at the ball at the start I know I yes they had you play it from
[1:16:59.840 --> 1:17:04.480]  there put live from the start here it is I think the gentleman from Missouri and
[1:17:04.480 --> 1:17:08.600]  I'm very concerned again about these motor takeovers from the federal
[1:17:08.600 --> 1:17:11.960]  government one thing that I'm very concerned about a story came out today
[1:17:11.960 --> 1:17:17.680]  where there's been approximately 1500 letters I believe that have gone out to
[1:17:17.680 --> 1:17:22.400]  GM dealerships one story that came out today there's a dealership that I know
[1:17:22.400 --> 1:17:28.480]  of that applied to their Democrat senator to appeal for help so that they
[1:17:28.480 --> 1:17:33.920]  could stay open that senator was able to arrange a meeting between the dealer
[1:17:33.920 --> 1:17:38.840]  and the officials at GM we all know GM is now government motors because it's
[1:17:38.840 --> 1:17:42.760]  owned by the American people it's been nationalized there's no private
[1:17:42.760 --> 1:17:47.360]  corporation the way we used to think of GM now the main stockholders the American
[1:17:47.360 --> 1:17:52.120]  government so this Democrat senator who was applied to for help was able to
[1:17:52.120 --> 1:17:57.400]  secure a meeting with general motors and the car dealership and they were able
[1:17:57.400 --> 1:18:01.120]  to get their dealership back well that's great that's wonderful there's also
[1:18:01.120 --> 1:18:06.680]  another article I saw today where a constituent had contacted one of the
[1:18:06.680 --> 1:18:09.880]  representatives a Democrat representative here in this chamber
[1:18:09.880 --> 1:18:14.360]  represent Bernie Frank Bernie Frank was able to go and talk to the right people
[1:18:14.360 --> 1:18:20.080]  and get this dealership back open is that what we have come to in this country
[1:18:20.080 --> 1:18:25.640]  that rather than a private business with a private contract with another
[1:18:25.640 --> 1:18:30.480]  private corporation they're no longer able to work out their agreements
[1:18:30.480 --> 1:18:35.960]  because his columnist Michael Barone has called he said now we've moved into the
[1:18:35.960 --> 1:18:40.760]  realm of gangster government we have gangster government when the federal
[1:18:40.760 --> 1:18:47.160]  government has set up a new cartel and private businesses now have to go
[1:18:47.160 --> 1:18:51.760]  begging with their handout to their local hopefully well politically
[1:18:51.760 --> 1:18:58.000]  connected congressman or their senator so they can buy a peace offering for
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:03.120]  that local business is that the kind of country we're going to have in the future
[1:19:03.120 --> 1:19:08.280]  when I was on the phone today for over an hour with one of my local dealers the
[1:19:08.280 --> 1:19:13.480]  very first thing out of her mouth was this she said this is the most un-American

[1:19:18.960 --> 1:19:24.960]  that my country would come to this point where having my dealership for 90

[1:33:30.840 --> 1:33:36.280]  a lot of them did but the elites learned to keep their hands off the american
[1:33:36.280 --> 1:33:42.200]  people at least to a certain extent
[1:33:42.200 --> 1:33:46.680]  and of course they get men back then didn't act tough they were tough
[1:33:46.680 --> 1:33:51.000]  physically they probably weren't as strong as the men of the day
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:54.440]  but their minds were strong
[1:33:55.160 --> 1:33:58.440]  and they were committed

[1:34:20.920 --> 1:34:23.720]  up in montreal
[1:34:24.280 --> 1:34:29.480]  and he found out there was a conference called the new world order and he sent
[1:34:29.480 --> 1:34:31.960]  us the documents for it they put out press releases
[1:34:31.960 --> 1:34:35.800]  now it's familiar with the group i'd read about it in spp
[1:34:35.800 --> 1:34:41.400]  documents that uh we'd gotten through for your acts
[1:34:41.400 --> 1:34:45.800]  international economic forum of the americas conference of montreal
[1:34:45.800 --> 1:34:50.440]  adapting to a new world order 15th annual conference hilton montreal
[1:34:50.440 --> 1:34:55.160]  bonaventure hotel 8 to the 11th so this ran through thursday
[1:34:55.160 --> 1:34:57.960]  ended friday
[1:34:59.320 --> 1:35:05.480]  officially ended thursday but some still there friday and uh
[1:35:05.480 --> 1:35:09.240]  just an amazing videos that he's posted we've linked him up on info wars.com
[1:35:09.240 --> 1:35:12.520]  and prisonplanet.com the police protecting it but but really that they
[1:35:12.520 --> 1:35:15.800]  put out this program this is exactly what we say the builderberg groups covering
[1:35:15.800 --> 1:35:18.280]  because we've gotten some of their minutes stolen them and
[1:35:18.280 --> 1:35:21.720]  they've also publicly released some now because they're in everybody's face and
[1:35:21.720 --> 1:35:25.880]  it calls for a global government global governance how to have the central
[1:35:25.880 --> 1:35:29.240]  banks take over so i thought we'd have him on about that but also we only had
[1:35:29.240 --> 1:35:33.160]  him on twice haven't had him on from thursday or friday what happened then
[1:35:33.160 --> 1:35:37.560]  so to give us a final recap of this key meeting remember though national news
[1:35:37.560 --> 1:35:39.880]  wrote several more stories over the weekend
[1:35:39.880 --> 1:35:44.920]  saying we're insane builderberg exist but they don't want world government
[1:35:44.920 --> 1:35:50.840]  yeah and uh birds don't fly and fish don't swim and
[1:35:50.840 --> 1:35:55.240]  politicians don't lie either right ah let's go to a sam labir
[1:35:55.240 --> 1:35:59.480]  sam good to have you here with us my friend hi alex good to talk to you
[1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:02.520]  thanks for having me good to have you sam okay recap the
[1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:05.480]  keys what was being covered there who you saw
[1:36:05.480 --> 1:36:09.320]  on all the new big developments uh that unfolded
[1:36:09.320 --> 1:36:12.680]  well uh one big thing that we learned about the conference
[1:36:12.680 --> 1:36:17.240]  is that it used to be done by invitation only exactly like the
[1:36:17.240 --> 1:36:20.760]  builderberg meeting and in the last few years they've
[1:36:20.760 --> 1:36:26.920]  opened it up to um to the public more uh you're able to buy your way in now and
[1:36:26.920 --> 1:36:30.040]  apparently they're going to release all the text of all the speeches that were
[1:36:30.040 --> 1:36:32.920]  given on their own website because there was the
[1:36:32.920 --> 1:36:36.360]  pressure from the public that this is the two secret of a meeting and what's
[1:36:36.360 --> 1:36:39.240]  going on and for those that don't know they've decided
[1:36:39.240 --> 1:36:43.240]  hiding and saying builderberg and cfr didn't exist as they did for decades
[1:36:43.240 --> 1:36:46.760]  blew up in their face so now they're going yeah there's world government but
[1:36:46.760 --> 1:36:51.240]  it's loving uh go ahead yeah so we're still waiting to see those
[1:36:51.240 --> 1:36:55.720]  documents on the website and uh we'll let you know uh we'll keep in touch about
[1:36:55.720 --> 1:37:00.840]  that there's still not up um the big thing on wednesday was madeline albright
[1:37:00.840 --> 1:37:05.400]  speech uh which was called the americas and the new world order
[1:37:05.400 --> 1:37:09.160]  now when we were interviewing people that were coming out uh and asked them
[1:37:09.160 --> 1:37:12.760]  what he talked about a lot of them said his speech was actually very boring
[1:37:12.760 --> 1:37:16.120]  and she didn't talk about anything in particular um
[1:37:16.120 --> 1:37:19.720]  however what we realized talking to a lot of these people that were coming out
[1:37:19.720 --> 1:37:23.160]  is if you think of the uh the new world order like a pyramid
[1:37:23.160 --> 1:37:27.160]  and you got Rockefeller and Kissinger at the top these are probably a few uh
[1:37:27.160 --> 1:37:31.720]  layers down in this is like what this is a regional thing just a co-opt
[1:37:31.720 --> 1:37:36.280]  and to make the locals feel important and to make them feel important and
[1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:40.120]  identify resistors so it's an intelligence gathering
[1:37:40.120 --> 1:37:42.760]  operation with all the phones tapped in the hotel
[1:37:42.760 --> 1:37:46.280]  everything in s.a. global run gsgq go ahead
[1:37:46.280 --> 1:37:50.360]  right exactly it's basically propagandizing the local elites to get them on
[1:37:50.360 --> 1:37:55.640]  board with uh with the agenda um so a lot of people that we interviewed
[1:37:55.640 --> 1:38:00.040]  they don't have really a concept of the new world order what's really going on
[1:38:00.040 --> 1:38:03.000]  in fact we talked to some of these up on youtube
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:06.120]  who are actually friends with key builder burgers in the city and they
[1:38:06.120 --> 1:38:09.240]  didn't even know that builder burger existed for those that don't know a
[1:38:09.240 --> 1:38:13.000]  local top banker in town comes out it's on video
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:16.600]  you're talking to him in french but you have a translation there for those in
[1:38:16.600 --> 1:38:21.400]  the uh who don't speak uh french and the issue is you see a top
[1:38:21.400 --> 1:38:24.840]  builder burger remember stop waving him and say don't talk too much to those
[1:38:24.840 --> 1:38:28.120]  guys and then drive off and then he said yeah i was
[1:38:28.120 --> 1:38:31.800]  inside there's no global government you're just you know going after ghost
[1:38:31.800 --> 1:38:35.720]  though i watched his body language i think he was being deceptive go ahead
[1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:41.480]  i'm not sure to be honest um i mean i was there interviewing him and if he was
[1:38:41.480 --> 1:38:45.240]  lying he's a very good liar because uh we were convinced that he
[1:38:45.240 --> 1:38:48.360]  he had never heard of builder burger he was being arrogant what it was
[1:38:48.360 --> 1:38:51.160]  well let me just tell you i'm a pretty good judge of people now after years of
[1:38:51.160 --> 1:38:55.320]  doing this he had an arrogant false aplomb
[1:38:55.320 --> 1:39:00.200]  on and yes he was bsing you in my opinion but go ahead
[1:39:00.200 --> 1:39:04.600]  well regardless um so there was there was uh quite a few people who came out
[1:39:04.600 --> 1:39:07.480]  and told us that madeline albright beast was about nothing
[1:39:07.480 --> 1:39:12.200]  um when we pushed on some people uh she said that she talked more about
[1:39:12.200 --> 1:39:16.040]  multilateralism and using the un a lot more
[1:39:16.040 --> 1:39:20.200]  and so it could be that if you knew what to listen for there actually were
[1:39:20.200 --> 1:39:23.160]  important things in her speech and just a lot of people didn't know what to
[1:39:23.160 --> 1:39:26.200]  listen for we're not sure yet we're hoping that they honor their promise
[1:39:26.200 --> 1:39:29.720]  and put up the full text well we know what was important what what they put
[1:39:29.720 --> 1:39:34.520]  out as their press release um on their own website that admits
[1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:39.160]  global government right there yeah yeah towards the global
[1:39:39.160 --> 1:39:44.440]  government was was uh on monday one of the uh key luncheon
[1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:48.360]  and like you said unesco the u n was there as the main sponsor with the
[1:39:48.360 --> 1:39:52.680]  genome Quebec and uh the local newspapers go ahead
[1:39:52.680 --> 1:39:56.200]  yeah it's really funny actually on tuesday the genomics was a big thing
[1:39:56.200 --> 1:40:00.120]  and on wednesday all the reporting in the media
[1:40:00.120 --> 1:40:05.080]  was talking about electric cars uh the big better results from tuesday were
[1:40:05.080 --> 1:40:08.760]  that electric cars were the new big thing and absolutely no mention of
[1:40:08.760 --> 1:40:12.040]  anything related to genetics
[1:40:12.040 --> 1:40:15.480]  all right let me just go over this it says finance and governance monday
[1:40:15.480 --> 1:40:19.320]  opening plenary session of the conference towards a new
[1:40:19.320 --> 1:40:25.480]  global economic order modernizing financial regulation that's translated to
[1:40:25.480 --> 1:40:28.520]  mean a new global bank of the world that sets all the tax rates they admit
[1:40:28.520 --> 1:40:31.000]  that making innovation strategy succeed in a
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:33.320]  globalized world that means using federal regulators
[1:40:33.320 --> 1:40:36.200]  to shut down all their competition and only allow the development of
[1:40:36.200 --> 1:40:39.640]  technologies owned by globalists the financial system
[1:40:39.640 --> 1:40:44.360]  out of the crisis new actors new issues creating new dummy corporations
[1:40:44.360 --> 1:40:48.120]  migration productivity and competition that means blasting out borders further
[1:40:48.120 --> 1:40:51.000]  destroying sovereignty the challenges of integration towards
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:54.360]  north american union that's what that means the challenges of integration means

[1:40:58.360 --> 1:41:02.920]  anything on that the new world governance
[1:41:02.920 --> 1:41:09.640]  no um that that was on um monday when there was a extreme police presence
[1:41:09.640 --> 1:41:13.240]  and uh nobody would talk to us when they were who and they were coming out
[1:41:13.240 --> 1:41:15.960]  now that was the real deal and thriving in a new financial
[1:41:15.960 --> 1:41:19.720]  oh yeah and then the other thing thing the other interesting thing about the
[1:41:19.720 --> 1:41:23.080]  global governor in the uh in the actual pamphlet
[1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:27.160]  uh with the with all the different events every almost every event had a

[1:41:34.520 --> 1:41:38.040]  had absolutely no blurb no description about what was going to be talked about
[1:41:38.040 --> 1:41:42.280]  no yeah and of course the real stuff went on at

[1:41:46.440 --> 1:41:50.120]  two thousand dollar an hour hookers were brought in and then it goes on
[1:41:50.120 --> 1:41:53.800]  sustainable development and innovations that means
[1:41:53.800 --> 1:41:56.680]  seizing the economy totally controlling what everybody can do
[1:41:56.680 --> 1:42:01.400]  except for select license global cartels agricultural production
[1:42:01.400 --> 1:42:07.000]  and food safety that means na is grabbing the farms the ranches openly
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:09.720]  minimizing risk to public health that's what that means

[1:44:59.240 --> 1:45:03.080]  facts for truth which started last year and what it was was um
[1:45:03.080 --> 1:45:07.240]  trying to organize fact campaigns for a 9-11
[1:45:07.240 --> 1:45:11.160]  and um with this recent um uh happening
[1:45:11.160 --> 1:45:16.120]  glenn beck uh labeling us as uh or labeling the holocaust museum shooter
[1:45:16.120 --> 1:45:20.040]  as a hero to our movement i've decided to uh to start the
[1:45:20.040 --> 1:45:24.520]  website up again so i'd like to announce it on your show that factsfortruth.com
[1:45:24.520 --> 1:45:28.680]  is going back online and uh we're starting a campaign today
[1:45:28.680 --> 1:45:32.200]  to get glenn beck fired removed from the airway for his
[1:45:32.200 --> 1:45:36.760]  uh completely irresponsible slandering of an entire movement
[1:45:36.760 --> 1:45:40.840]  uh trying to label us with the holocaust deniers and such
[1:45:40.840 --> 1:45:44.040]  well by the way the london guardians doing that that's the talking point and
[1:45:44.040 --> 1:45:47.640]  again there this is only giving credibility to all the nazis
[1:45:47.640 --> 1:45:51.960]  this is only making most 9-11 truth isn't about that
[1:45:51.960 --> 1:45:55.800]  and and there's no evidence quote that he's our hero that's just made up crap
[1:45:55.800 --> 1:46:01.960]  and when you hear beck he says i have no proof i mean like i said uh glenn beck
[1:46:01.960 --> 1:46:07.080]  uh is a uh hero to pedophiles that's not true
[1:46:07.080 --> 1:46:12.120]  i'll say it's anybody it's just his ashtonine you know i have to do it
[1:46:12.120 --> 1:46:16.040]  oh god i'm sorry go ahead i have to i have to do is say well i can't confirm
[1:46:16.040 --> 1:46:18.760]  or deny this and you can see whatever you want apparently
[1:46:18.760 --> 1:46:22.360]  i can't confirm or deny that glenn beck has children locked up in a basement and
[1:46:22.360 --> 1:46:25.640]  he cuts their heads off every night and i want to say on record that's not true
[1:46:25.640 --> 1:46:30.200]  i'm joking to make the point of what he's saying
[1:46:30.200 --> 1:46:33.560]  but why was vaughn broon let out of jail after five and a half years when he
[1:46:33.560 --> 1:46:37.640]  tried to attack the fellow reserve with handguns and dynamite
[1:46:37.640 --> 1:46:41.320]  oh there's so many questions it's a very strange case guys have fed
[1:46:41.320 --> 1:46:45.560]  hey hey separately did you see seeing in a minute adam gedon's the son of the
[1:46:45.560 --> 1:46:52.280]  former adl head the head of al-qaeda and also uh the auto a citizen reports
[1:46:52.280 --> 1:46:55.800]  and the headline creating anti-symmetism since 1965
[1:46:55.800 --> 1:47:01.400]  that in 1966 and 65 the canadian jewish congress helped organize the fledgling
[1:47:01.400 --> 1:47:05.400]  canadian nazi party i saw that actually today up on your website and
[1:47:05.400 --> 1:47:08.680]  um you were saying that it's related to the broncman
[1:47:08.680 --> 1:47:12.920]  now that's who set up the jewish con that yeah well the broncman are a huge
[1:47:12.920 --> 1:47:16.280]  family here in montreal so we're gonna have to go over and ask them about this
[1:47:16.280 --> 1:47:20.360]  because this is this is huge if it's true i tell you i don't enjoy going up
[1:47:20.360 --> 1:47:23.400]  against these people but i'm tired of the nazis
[1:47:23.400 --> 1:47:27.240]  and i'm tired of the of using the nazis to restrict free speech and
[1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:31.000]  pimping out the people killed by hitler i mean this is also
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:34.280]  you know hitler was a bad guy and did kill a lot of jews and other people
[1:47:34.280 --> 1:47:39.320]  millions of people and and it's wrong to use those people's dead
[1:47:39.320 --> 1:47:43.720]  to destroy liberty and freedom in the u.s and do the type of free speech attacks
[1:47:43.720 --> 1:47:48.200]  that hillar would do and i've just i mean this is really a dangerous game
[1:47:48.200 --> 1:47:52.440]  that uh the adl southern primary law center are using
[1:47:52.440 --> 1:47:56.200]  well it's like you say alex um i would rather be doing anything than having to
[1:47:56.200 --> 1:47:59.480]  fight these uh these new world order type people but we don't have a choice
[1:47:59.480 --> 1:48:03.880]  right we either live on our feet or die on our knees
[1:48:03.880 --> 1:48:07.080]  that's it but we die on our feet die on our feet or live on our knees
[1:48:07.080 --> 1:48:11.320]  what i meant to say sorry well i mean folks i want you to know a lot of you
[1:48:11.320 --> 1:48:14.680]  are getting recruited by the nazis because it is corrupt what israel's
[1:48:14.680 --> 1:48:18.600]  doing it is out of control is you know the i mean in front of the new york
[1:48:18.600 --> 1:48:21.640]  times ron emmanuel cracking his knuckles and
[1:48:21.640 --> 1:48:24.520]  and and you know when when the president tells him stop
[1:48:24.520 --> 1:48:27.800]  that's like hiking his leg and marking his territory on him
[1:48:27.800 --> 1:48:31.240]  this is part of a more sophisticated game
[1:48:31.240 --> 1:48:38.920]  and uh it's meant to persecute jews so they will then serve
[1:48:38.920 --> 1:48:42.600]  the more criminal elements of the zionist movement this is a very
[1:48:42.600 --> 1:48:46.520]  sophisticated game that's going to end up in a bunch of jews getting killed
[1:48:46.520 --> 1:48:50.680]  and in america falling because don't think the nazis aren't going to be defeated
[1:48:50.680 --> 1:48:55.800]  in the end of this this is a sophisticated high level game and
[1:48:55.800 --> 1:48:59.400]  that's why i have the nazis attacking me and i have the adl attacking me and
[1:48:59.400 --> 1:49:03.000]  i'm sick of it go ahead
[1:49:03.160 --> 1:49:07.160]  so um i've sent the information about the facts for truth
[1:49:07.160 --> 1:49:11.000]  the relaunching and the new campaign to get glenn beck off the airwaves to
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:15.080]  rob d and i hope it gets posted on your website it's also sent to 911 blogger
[1:49:15.080 --> 1:49:20.840]  i'd like to offer my services to you if uh in the future any sort of um
[1:49:20.840 --> 1:49:24.200]  event happens where we need to organize some sort of fax campaign it will always
[1:49:24.200 --> 1:49:29.000]  be open to uh to info wars and in the future i hope to uh start
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:33.080]  campaigns in the next few weeks supporting um ron paul's
[1:49:33.080 --> 1:49:37.000]  bill in the senate trying to now that he's got enough cosponsors in the house
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:40.200]  to have a fax campaign to get senators on board
[1:49:40.200 --> 1:49:43.800]  and also a fax to the white house now that joe pedin
[1:49:43.800 --> 1:49:48.040]  has received the uh hermetic evidence in the world trade center does
[1:49:48.040 --> 1:49:51.640]  teaching obama to act on this information so um
[1:49:51.640 --> 1:49:55.080]  so look out for that in the next two weeks separately though are you saying
[1:49:55.080 --> 1:49:59.560]  you send stuff out via fax machine yes well on the internet now you can send
[1:49:59.560 --> 1:50:02.840]  faxes for free if you have an email address you send faxes over the
[1:50:02.840 --> 1:50:07.400]  internet no let me stop you let me stop you people tend to ignore emails now
[1:50:07.400 --> 1:50:12.120]  to a great extent they're still useful but absolutely fax machines and there
[1:50:12.120 --> 1:50:17.000]  aren't a bunch of spam laws on those are devastatingly accurate because people
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:20.840]  tend to read faxes and i think you've really hit on something here
[1:50:20.840 --> 1:50:24.120]  uh that's intriguing so give folks that website out again
[1:50:24.120 --> 1:50:29.320]  that's it it's faxfortruth.com and uh yeah that's why i started
[1:50:29.320 --> 1:50:32.840]  creating it because like you said emails can be deleted very easily but faxes
[1:50:32.840 --> 1:50:36.600]  it's a lot harder to ignore and because now with the internet we can send faxes
[1:50:36.600 --> 1:50:39.720]  for free anybody can do it it's a great way to
[1:50:39.720 --> 1:50:44.760]  organize people and make an impact you know i think the reason to go after
[1:50:44.760 --> 1:50:48.120]  back is the fact that he's cia just like anderson
[1:50:48.120 --> 1:50:51.640]  kuber and he has cia on the show every night and he's following
[1:50:51.640 --> 1:50:55.320]  homeland security documents and battle plans
[1:50:55.320 --> 1:50:59.640]  stay there let's talk more about this when we get back on the other side

[1:55:41.320 --> 1:55:44.280]  gets to me and i pointed out that listeners should just

[2:00:26.840 --> 2:00:32.120]  it is monday june 15 2009 we've got two hours left
[2:00:32.120 --> 2:00:38.440]  spanning out like a vista before us as we go in through and beyond as we
[2:00:38.440 --> 2:00:43.000]  talk to one of the most prolific researchers one of the most prolific
[2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  minds out there in challenging the established
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:54.680]  false reality he is a great dispenser of hundreds of millions of red pills
[2:00:54.680 --> 2:00:58.600]  to humanity and he has taken a lot of people
[2:00:58.600 --> 2:01:02.920]  very very deep down the rabbit hole indeed to where we're not in kansas
[2:01:02.920 --> 2:01:06.600]  anymore you can question and debate the perceptions
[2:01:06.600 --> 2:01:10.840]  through the rose color darkly that uh david ike
[2:01:10.840 --> 2:01:14.600]  looks through but be careful that when you're getting the speck out of his eye
[2:01:14.600 --> 2:01:18.280]  you don't get the giant beam out of yours it's important to get that beam out
[2:01:18.280 --> 2:01:22.840]  we all see through different perceptions but certainly the perception of david
[2:01:22.840 --> 2:01:26.360]  ike has proven to be much more clear than the average
[2:01:26.360 --> 2:01:28.760]  man or woman out there so it's always great to have david with us
[2:01:28.760 --> 2:01:32.440]  i have a host of issues i want to talk to him about where the new order is going
[2:01:32.440 --> 2:01:34.920]  what they're doing currently trying to start world war three
[2:01:34.920 --> 2:01:37.960]  with iran trying to start things up over there
[2:01:37.960 --> 2:01:40.760]  trying to start things up with north korea knowing they're in the middle of a power
[2:01:40.760 --> 2:01:43.480]  sharing uh and a power transfer saying they're
[2:01:43.480 --> 2:01:46.840]  going to board their ships a new cuban missile crisis
[2:01:46.840 --> 2:01:49.880]  i think we're not defending north korea or iran the point is it's the bigger
[2:01:49.880 --> 2:01:54.120]  globalist evil using a smaller evil to bring in a global distraction
[2:01:54.120 --> 2:01:58.120]  and the south ossetia conflict nato encircling russia
[2:01:58.120 --> 2:02:03.000]  pakistan all of this today is the world launches into economic collapse launches
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:07.080]  into worldwide warfare as the rand corporation is called for
[2:02:07.080 --> 2:02:10.520]  so joining us at david ike dot com's the website our websites are in full wars
[2:02:10.520 --> 2:02:13.560]  dot com and prison planet dot com is
[2:02:13.560 --> 2:02:16.520]  the great david ike david ike thank you for joining us
[2:02:16.520 --> 2:02:21.480]  that's a pleasure alex how are you good you you heard me run down uh you know
[2:02:21.480 --> 2:02:24.040]  some of the ideas of things that i think are important right now
[2:02:24.040 --> 2:02:27.800]  let's start with suddenly somebody flips a switch
[2:02:27.800 --> 2:02:31.080]  and there's world crises we're on the edge of nuclear war
[2:02:31.080 --> 2:02:34.760]  they're saying north korea is going to nuke they're saying they're going to nuke
[2:02:34.760 --> 2:02:38.520]  people months ago you were on the show three or four months ago and you said
[2:02:38.520 --> 2:02:41.800]  you thought they were gearing up for a world war
[2:02:41.800 --> 2:02:45.480]  yeah well that's uh... where they want to go because uh...
[2:02:45.480 --> 2:02:50.440]  the world wars have served them very well um nothing changes society quicker
[2:02:50.440 --> 2:02:55.560]  and more fundamentally and completely uh... and uh... you know
[2:02:55.560 --> 2:03:00.680]  irreversibly than a war and so when you look at the world after world war one
[2:03:00.680 --> 2:03:04.920]  uh... it was uh... a world that was controlled by far fewer people
[2:03:04.920 --> 2:03:08.280]  and much more centralization of power than before
[2:03:08.280 --> 2:03:12.360]  world war two came along that process took a giant leap forward and we had all
[2:03:12.360 --> 2:03:17.720]  these global institutions and the united nations the breton woods agreement
[2:03:17.720 --> 2:03:21.080]  the european union was justified to a large extent to
[2:03:21.080 --> 2:03:25.880]  stopping war in europe uh... and so to complete the job to move into this
[2:03:25.880 --> 2:03:29.000]  this final global society that they want
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:33.960]  um... at third world war is what is on the agenda and uh...
[2:03:33.960 --> 2:03:38.200]  i would have mentioned this before but um... i had a letter from a
[2:03:38.200 --> 2:03:43.560]  a traffic warden a guy here in britain that's supposed to dispense
[2:03:43.560 --> 2:03:48.760]  tickets for people who have broken the parking laws and he contacted me
[2:03:48.760 --> 2:03:53.240]  uh... must be a year or so ago now and said that he'd been called in
[2:03:53.240 --> 2:03:58.520]  and uh... given uh... nuke cards that he was told to take home and put away till
[2:03:58.520 --> 2:04:02.360]  further notice one of them was the card that uh... gave him the right to be a
[2:04:02.360 --> 2:04:05.560]  traffic warden that you show for identity that's fair enough
[2:04:05.560 --> 2:04:09.240]  the second one was what they call a pace card which is the words that a police
[2:04:09.240 --> 2:04:12.440]  officer reads when he's arresting someone
[2:04:12.440 --> 2:04:15.480]  and the third one was the card giving him a traffic warden
[2:04:15.480 --> 2:04:19.000]  the right to uh... enter property without permission
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:22.600]  and of course he's he's he's questioning what the heck i do i need these for
[2:04:22.600 --> 2:04:26.280]  well just go leave them till further notice he then meets a friend of his a
[2:04:26.280 --> 2:04:29.080]  few days later who's a police officer
[2:04:29.080 --> 2:04:33.800]  um... and he said that um... this police officer said that he would he was a
[2:04:33.800 --> 2:04:37.160]  uh... a man designated in his county and there was someone like him in every
[2:04:37.160 --> 2:04:40.520]  county and they were there to prepare for a coming
[2:04:40.520 --> 2:04:43.480]  war stay there stay there david got a break long
[2:04:43.480 --> 2:04:46.280]  segment coming okay recap that when we come back
[2:04:46.280 --> 2:04:50.440]  same thing is happening here i can independently verify with government
[2:04:50.440 --> 2:04:54.440]  documents what you just said in the united states canada australia
[2:04:54.440 --> 2:05:00.920]  europe robert will be right back on the night
[2:05:00.920 --> 2:05:04.200]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider
[2:05:04.200 --> 2:05:07.480]  buying a solar power generator this summer number one new climate
[2:05:07.480 --> 2:05:10.200]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[2:05:10.200 --> 2:05:14.680]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[2:05:14.680 --> 2:05:18.120]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[2:05:18.120 --> 2:05:21.160]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[2:05:21.160 --> 2:05:24.760]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[2:05:24.760 --> 2:05:27.720]  overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[2:05:27.720 --> 2:05:31.240]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again
[2:05:31.240 --> 2:05:34.280]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[2:05:34.280 --> 2:05:37.480]  outages number five a solar power generator provides
[2:05:37.480 --> 2:05:41.320]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar
[2:05:41.320 --> 2:05:43.800]  power generators offered by solution from science

[2:08:01.080 --> 2:08:04.680]  the genesis communications radio network proudly presents
[2:08:04.680 --> 2:08:13.160]  the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[2:08:13.160 --> 2:08:16.440]  well he needs no introduction but i know some stations weren't carrying that
[2:08:16.440 --> 2:08:21.480]  last segment he was telling a story about a traffic warden
[2:08:21.480 --> 2:08:24.520]  who he knows in england who said he was given a card
[2:08:24.520 --> 2:08:29.400]  to put away for secret emergencies to be able to enter homes without warrants
[2:08:29.400 --> 2:08:31.720]  and then his friend didn't really know what that would be used for then he
[2:08:31.720 --> 2:08:35.320]  talked to another police officer who explained to him
[2:08:35.320 --> 2:08:39.080]  the key piece of the puzzle and then i was saying to david i can independently
[2:08:39.080 --> 2:08:43.640]  verify this is even in our news with infregard
[2:08:43.640 --> 2:08:46.680]  that we told people about a year before it was in the news now they admit it
[2:08:46.680 --> 2:08:50.760]  56 000 and growing that's a year old numbers
[2:08:50.760 --> 2:08:55.800]  infrastructure protection key people and power plants refineries businesses
[2:08:55.800 --> 2:08:59.800]  uh i have a guy here who worked in lcra security
[2:08:59.800 --> 2:09:02.680]  and uh five years six years ago but here before he worked here
[2:09:02.680 --> 2:09:06.520]  they gave him a card for infrastructure security basically get out of jail
[2:09:06.520 --> 2:09:09.960]  free card and all the police have these badges they
[2:09:09.960 --> 2:09:14.120]  supposed to keep them away and they're saying oh yes the american people are
[2:09:14.120 --> 2:09:16.360]  the terrorists the british people are the terrorist
[2:09:16.360 --> 2:09:19.880]  homeland securities for them martial laws coming a war is coming
[2:09:19.880 --> 2:09:22.920]  david continue with what the police officer told you
[2:09:22.920 --> 2:09:27.240]  well the police officer who's a friend of his traffic warden he called him
[2:09:27.240 --> 2:09:30.360]  aside uh one day and said look because i'm a good friend of you i'm going to
[2:09:30.360 --> 2:09:33.240]  tell you this but he said five times in the conversation you must not tell
[2:09:33.240 --> 2:09:37.880]  anyone else and what the police officer said was that um he had a job in that
[2:09:37.880 --> 2:09:40.600]  county and there was someone like him in every
[2:09:40.600 --> 2:09:44.440]  other county of the united kingdom and their job in the police force was to
[2:09:44.440 --> 2:09:48.280]  prepare for a coming war which they knew was coming and they were
[2:09:48.280 --> 2:09:53.640]  preparing for it well in advance and that uh the military
[2:09:53.640 --> 2:10:01.880]  and the regular police were going to be uh used to uh meet what they uh
[2:10:01.880 --> 2:10:05.560]  knew was coming in terms of civil unrest in the streets
[2:10:05.560 --> 2:10:09.720]  when that war uh started and then they built up to that war
[2:10:09.720 --> 2:10:14.840]  and he said you people traffic wardens and private security guards and and
[2:10:14.840 --> 2:10:19.240]  other uh such people are going to be given powers
[2:10:19.240 --> 2:10:23.800]  um that the police normally do so that you can do those things while we're
[2:10:23.800 --> 2:10:26.680]  dealing with the civil unrest as a result of this war
[2:10:26.680 --> 2:10:32.680]  and very very shortly after um the uh traffic warden contacted me the
[2:10:32.680 --> 2:10:36.680]  government changed the name of traffic wardens from traffic wardens to civil
[2:10:36.680 --> 2:10:41.240]  enforcement officers um and uh gave them more powers not
[2:10:41.240 --> 2:10:44.680]  all the powers but more powers that the police normally do
[2:10:44.680 --> 2:10:49.640]  and then about six months later the government announced a new type of
[2:10:49.640 --> 2:10:54.120]  person called a credited persons and these were wait for it
[2:10:54.120 --> 2:10:58.760]  private security guards and all the the kind of people that the policeman had
[2:10:58.760 --> 2:11:02.280]  listed who were going to be given uh the right
[2:11:02.280 --> 2:11:06.200]  to stop and question people to hand out certain
[2:11:06.200 --> 2:11:11.240]  fines to hold them till the police arrived um and it's all part of this
[2:11:11.240 --> 2:11:16.360]  layer by layer building of self-policing the people self-policing each other
[2:11:16.360 --> 2:11:19.640]  because of course when there's a few of you and you got
[2:11:19.640 --> 2:11:24.600]  you want to control the many there's not enough of you physically to do it
[2:11:24.600 --> 2:11:29.080]  so you have to get your target population or many of the people within it
[2:11:29.080 --> 2:11:33.640]  to police the target population you have to get the sheep herd to police each
[2:11:33.640 --> 2:11:38.760]  other so they don't need uh so many sheepdogs externally uh and
[2:11:38.760 --> 2:11:42.200]  shepherds externally that the sheep are doing it for themselves
[2:11:42.200 --> 2:11:45.400]  and this is what's being built all over the world and this
[2:11:45.400 --> 2:11:50.520]  this third world war is definitely in the agenda because it's a massive problem
[2:11:50.520 --> 2:11:55.320]  which will be uh in need of a global because of the global nature of the
[2:11:55.320 --> 2:11:59.880]  conflict a global solution which will be the uh the final
[2:11:59.880 --> 2:12:03.400]  move to this structure we've been talking about all these years of world
[2:12:03.400 --> 2:12:06.600]  government world army and all the rest of it because the world army
[2:12:06.600 --> 2:12:10.920]  will be justified by the only way to stop war is to have one world army and
[2:12:10.920 --> 2:12:14.440]  then no one can fight each other in terms of major conflicts anymore
[2:12:14.440 --> 2:12:17.400]  this these are the kind of things we're going to be seeing unfolding
[2:12:17.400 --> 2:12:21.480]  okay david uh i just want to back you up
[2:12:21.480 --> 2:12:25.160]  because people are hearing this or months from now watching this on youtube
[2:12:25.160 --> 2:12:29.960]  or prisonplanet.tv and they're saying okay what's the proof
[2:12:29.960 --> 2:12:34.360]  everything david just said every term he used
[2:12:34.360 --> 2:12:37.960]  i have hundreds of mainstream articles government documents let me just go over
[2:12:37.960 --> 2:12:41.560]  a few of them here in the united states
[2:12:41.560 --> 2:12:45.560]  they are preparing paramilitary police it's it's
[2:12:45.560 --> 2:12:49.400]  announced by the air force the army they have regular army in tennessee
[2:12:49.400 --> 2:12:52.840]  without warrants running warrantless checkpoints in the newspaper
[2:12:52.840 --> 2:12:57.400]  north commas announced that they are to take on the american people
[2:12:57.400 --> 2:13:02.360]  the homeland security documents uh dhs documents we broke that made national
[2:13:02.360 --> 2:13:05.080]  news state the number one threat is returning vets
[2:13:05.080 --> 2:13:08.040]  gun owners that the whole homeland security system is for us
[2:13:08.040 --> 2:13:11.880]  the british ministry of defense 10 year report
[2:13:11.880 --> 2:13:15.720]  one and guardian reported on it but it was declassified 120 pages
[2:13:15.720 --> 2:13:22.840]  was put out in september of 2007 and said in the coming next few years
[2:13:22.840 --> 2:13:26.120]  the public would rebel against the the corrupt government
[2:13:26.120 --> 2:13:29.960]  but that their job was to suppress the public to bring us into this new
[2:13:29.960 --> 2:13:33.720]  new world order and it said they will even of the british people they say
[2:13:33.720 --> 2:13:37.000]  try to march on london they will use neutron
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:39.720]  bombs on them and then dick cheney said in the peanut
[2:13:39.720 --> 2:13:42.920]  documents september 20th 2000 rebuilding america's defenses
[2:13:42.920 --> 2:13:46.920]  that they would use race specific bio weapons
[2:13:46.920 --> 2:13:53.160]  on us and now another layer under the paramilitary you know the the the spooks
[2:13:53.160 --> 2:13:57.240]  the paramilitary the police the traffic wardens auxiliary
[2:13:57.240 --> 2:14:00.280]  tattletales there's now the trusted traveler
[2:14:00.280 --> 2:14:04.440]  north american hemispheric card and if you have that flying internally say
[2:14:04.440 --> 2:14:08.360]  from austin to new york you show that and go through the head of the line
[2:14:08.360 --> 2:14:11.320]  so they're already making it that if you waive all your rights and take
[2:14:11.320 --> 2:14:14.440]  the special card you get to the head of the line then they're just going to
[2:14:14.440 --> 2:14:18.440]  make it mandatory for everybody david i well that's what they do i mean they
[2:14:18.440 --> 2:14:23.160]  they say oh this will be uh voluntary uh for the people to decide if they want
[2:14:23.160 --> 2:14:26.760]  to have it like uh identity cards and stuff like that
[2:14:26.760 --> 2:14:31.000]  but what they then do is make it so difficult to operate in society without
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:34.040]  one of them and eventually they say well there's so
[2:14:34.040 --> 2:14:36.920]  few people don't have them now it where everyone might have might might well
[2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:39.800]  have them by by law and all the rest of it these are the techniques they use
[2:14:39.800 --> 2:14:43.320]  and of course as we've talked about before on the show um
[2:14:43.320 --> 2:14:46.840]  a bush was the uh the problem part of this uh
[2:14:46.840 --> 2:14:52.760]  presidential handover and obama's been brought in as the uh person offering the
[2:14:52.760 --> 2:14:55.320]  solutions and of course the solutions are going to be
[2:14:55.320 --> 2:14:59.640]  the unfolding agenda and one of his um solutions of course is this
[2:14:59.640 --> 2:15:03.800]  civil army in effect that uh he's been talking about and roman manual has been
[2:15:03.800 --> 2:15:07.160]  talking about and uh that is another key
[2:15:07.160 --> 2:15:12.120]  layer of this police uh policing of the people by the people
[2:15:12.120 --> 2:15:14.760]  which is what you had in nazi germany and that's
[2:15:14.760 --> 2:15:19.640]  what kirin is always doing you know people have got to decide
[2:15:19.640 --> 2:15:23.880]  how long we're going to talk about this uh before we draw a draw a line in the
[2:15:23.880 --> 2:15:28.600]  sand and say hey instead of um sitting here and watching
[2:15:28.600 --> 2:15:32.440]  our prison being built and and uh discussing it and debating it what
[2:15:32.440 --> 2:15:35.960]  the heck are we going to do about it because there's going to come a point
[2:15:35.960 --> 2:15:41.240]  where we're going to cross a line where this uh uh momentum is going to be
[2:15:41.240 --> 2:15:44.360]  very difficult to turn back it needs a lot of people
[2:15:44.360 --> 2:15:48.920]  to with a lot of focus and a lot of disconnection of back sides from sofas
[2:15:48.920 --> 2:15:54.680]  now before this gets completely enough to the outer hand
[2:15:54.680 --> 2:15:58.200]  well david ike i hardly agree with you and and
[2:15:58.200 --> 2:16:01.960]  we're going to talk about a host of issues today
[2:16:01.960 --> 2:16:05.800]  and later in the next hour let's get into some of your ideas for solutions
[2:16:05.800 --> 2:16:09.720]  and and and breaking free of this matrix in fact let's go ahead and start
[2:16:09.720 --> 2:16:13.960]  talking about some of that now coming up in the next
[2:16:13.960 --> 2:16:21.240]  segment i'm going to play a video clip from a satire movie about sitcoms
[2:16:21.240 --> 2:16:26.920]  but when you watch it it actually has the same messages that really are in the
[2:16:26.920 --> 2:16:30.920]  children's programming and the sitcoms and they're dumbing the language down
[2:16:30.920 --> 2:16:34.760]  and they're reducing the language and how many words people use and
[2:16:34.760 --> 2:16:39.480]  people are talking slower and people don't even understand
[2:16:39.480 --> 2:16:45.640]  common words now uh people are being inserted into the matrix
[2:16:45.640 --> 2:16:49.400]  as the eyes tie into the television and the computers and people are texting to
[2:16:49.400 --> 2:16:53.000]  their friends who are five feet away instead of talking to them
[2:16:53.000 --> 2:16:57.080]  we are beginning to merge into the machines we're not programming them
[2:16:57.080 --> 2:17:00.120]  we're being programmed through the machines that have been programmed to
[2:17:00.120 --> 2:17:03.800]  program us and the consciousness is closing down
[2:17:03.800 --> 2:17:07.720]  with large swaths of the public while at the same time
[2:17:07.720 --> 2:17:11.400]  another large group is exploding their awakening
[2:17:11.400 --> 2:17:14.600]  uh and how you see this battle unfolding
[2:17:14.600 --> 2:17:17.400]  as we rush towards what the establishment calls
[2:17:17.400 --> 2:17:20.280]  the singularity
[2:17:22.440 --> 2:17:25.960]  so david what's your take on that i thought we're going to a break uh
[2:17:25.960 --> 2:17:29.080]  we're not saying when we come back from break i'm going to play a clip but but
[2:17:29.080 --> 2:17:31.480]  i mean now i've got you got you i thought we're going to break now
[2:17:31.480 --> 2:17:35.480]  no i mean you know this is this is my area really in in so many ways because
[2:17:35.480 --> 2:17:40.200]  uh particularly since about 2002 2003 i've really gone very very deeply into
[2:17:40.200 --> 2:17:43.640]  the nature of reality uh which not many people
[2:17:43.640 --> 2:17:47.880]  tend to do and when you start to realize what reality is my goodness does
[2:17:47.880 --> 2:17:51.720]  society as it's structured and the way it's structured start to make perfect
[2:17:51.720 --> 2:17:56.120]  sense first of all um it's so important to realize
[2:17:56.120 --> 2:17:59.720]  the difference between the body and consciousness it's not this it's not the
[2:17:59.720 --> 2:18:03.560]  same thing now you know we may have differing
[2:18:03.560 --> 2:18:08.280]  religions uh different people listen to this show but but one thing is
[2:18:08.280 --> 2:18:12.200]  kind of common to them is that some kind of uh consciousness
[2:18:12.200 --> 2:18:16.360]  soul whatever you want to call it is is apart from the body and and
[2:18:16.360 --> 2:18:22.280]  leaves the body at what we call death therefore the body and uh the soul the
[2:18:22.280 --> 2:18:26.200]  the consciousness whatever you want to call it and not the same thing
[2:18:26.200 --> 2:18:30.920]  the idea of the conspiracy the very bottom line of of the conspiracy is to
[2:18:30.920 --> 2:18:33.960]  disconnect those higher levels of awareness
[2:18:33.960 --> 2:18:37.640]  from what is the computer the body the body's a biological computer
[2:18:37.640 --> 2:18:42.440]  and and it ticks every single box of that and what i mean by biological is
[2:18:42.440 --> 2:18:46.360]  it's not like a desktop computer where you put data in and you press the
[2:18:46.360 --> 2:18:48.920]  button and you you you know exactly what it's going to do because it's
[2:18:48.920 --> 2:18:51.720]  programmed to do that although we're getting more and more like that
[2:18:51.720 --> 2:18:55.480]  biological computer means it has the ability to think and assess data
[2:18:55.480 --> 2:18:58.680]  this is what the immune system is doing all the time it's scanning data
[2:18:58.680 --> 2:19:01.720]  what's happening in the body and reacting to it that is these
[2:19:01.720 --> 2:19:06.680]  fit in the circumstances that it faces the idea of the conspiracy
[2:19:06.680 --> 2:19:11.400]  is to pull people's sense of awareness the point from which they observe the
[2:19:11.400 --> 2:19:16.200]  world from consciousness which is uh not in this world it is
[2:19:16.200 --> 2:19:19.400]  observing and experiencing this world through the body
[2:19:19.400 --> 2:19:23.080]  to pull that point of awareness into the body because once it does that it's
[2:19:23.080 --> 2:19:26.840]  pulled you into the computer level of of of awareness the computer level
[2:19:26.840 --> 2:19:32.120]  of sense of reality and what that does it pulls you into all the programs
[2:19:32.120 --> 2:19:34.920]  that are running through the body like software programs
[2:19:34.920 --> 2:19:39.080]  and these are all reaction programs which get you to react
[2:19:39.080 --> 2:19:42.360]  to data i.e situations they create in the world
[2:19:42.360 --> 2:19:47.160]  in precisely the way they want us to react so we become little more than
[2:19:47.160 --> 2:19:51.640]  biological robots which is where most people in this world are
[2:19:51.640 --> 2:19:55.240]  more and more i mean i've always known this concept to be true this
[2:19:55.240 --> 2:19:58.280]  you know the scientists and mind warfare experts say it themselves
[2:19:58.280 --> 2:20:05.000]  but now i'm consciously really realizing stay with us
[2:20:05.000 --> 2:20:09.000]  news flash unemployment is soaring over 10 percent
[2:20:09.000 --> 2:20:14.520]  the dollar is plummeting and banks are beginning to close their doors
[2:20:14.520 --> 2:20:19.160]  financial experts are saying we are headed for an economic depression depression
[2:20:19.160 --> 2:20:24.280]  the world is on the brink of total meltdown unless you expect the
[2:20:24.280 --> 2:20:28.120]  government to bail you out you must be able to grow your own

[2:24:15.640 --> 2:24:19.880]  and what david here is talking about is so important
[2:24:19.880 --> 2:24:23.880]  when you're in a view kind of above yourself outside the world
[2:24:23.880 --> 2:24:27.720]  realizing that this is a biological earth suit
[2:24:27.720 --> 2:24:33.480]  and that the the the system knows how to program it with hormones and drugs
[2:24:33.480 --> 2:24:37.960]  and war and feedback and sex when they're used sex to sell
[2:24:37.960 --> 2:24:44.360]  calvin klyne genes uh they are going at your primitive
[2:24:44.360 --> 2:24:47.880]  sexual centers in your lower brain this is all a fact
[2:24:47.880 --> 2:24:51.320]  and just to get the public to realize they're being bombarded they're being
[2:24:51.320 --> 2:24:55.000]  programmed if you can get them to do that they kind of wake up out of the
[2:24:55.000 --> 2:24:57.480]  trance realize you're being bombarded
[2:24:57.480 --> 2:25:02.120]  realize there's a game uh i mean i don't know how to quantify this david but
[2:25:02.120 --> 2:25:05.560]  you know to me you talk about being outside you know of the body consciousness
[2:25:05.560 --> 2:25:09.240]  or whatever i mean to me the term i would use is just
[2:25:09.240 --> 2:25:12.920]  realize that that you are being bombarded with
[2:25:12.920 --> 2:25:17.240]  data realize that that there is a manipulation going on knowing
[2:25:17.240 --> 2:25:21.160]  it's half the battle which is so important i'll give you an example
[2:25:21.160 --> 2:25:25.400]  um in my talks i put some pictures on the screen
[2:25:25.400 --> 2:25:30.840]  uh which are subliminal advertisements um and most people the vast majority
[2:25:30.840 --> 2:25:34.440]  people can't see them because that's what subliminal is below
[2:25:34.440 --> 2:25:38.120]  threshold uh the the conscious mind doesn't see them which the
[2:25:38.120 --> 2:25:41.080]  conscious mind actually sees very little compared with what actually is in
[2:25:41.080 --> 2:25:44.760]  front of it the subconscious mind however picks it all up and
[2:25:44.760 --> 2:25:47.960]  affects the person's reality without them realizing it by
[2:25:47.960 --> 2:25:50.760]  the message that's been passed through the subliminal
[2:25:50.760 --> 2:25:55.480]  image and then um i will put the picture back up again
[2:25:55.480 --> 2:25:59.880]  a few minutes later and this is the same with all subliminals
[2:25:59.880 --> 2:26:03.720]  the first thing you see once it's been pointed out
[2:26:03.720 --> 2:26:07.400]  earlier when you see the picture again is the subliminal
[2:26:07.400 --> 2:26:12.360]  so when people start to this is why this this area is so important
[2:26:12.360 --> 2:26:16.280]  when people start to realize how it's being done to them
[2:26:16.280 --> 2:26:20.920]  then they bring it from below threshold subliminal to the conscious
[2:26:20.920 --> 2:26:24.600]  awareness and the the the the defenses go up
[2:26:24.600 --> 2:26:28.600]  um which they don't have to think about them naturally the defenses up once the
[2:26:28.600 --> 2:26:31.960]  conscious mind is aware of the game it's involved in
[2:26:31.960 --> 2:26:38.360]  and we um we need to understand the fundamental significance
[2:26:38.360 --> 2:26:42.040]  to the whole conspiracy of something called the reptilian brain
[2:26:42.040 --> 2:26:45.640]  the reptilian brain is where we get along with other parts of the brain but
[2:26:45.640 --> 2:26:49.000]  massively the reptilian brain our survival instincts
[2:26:49.000 --> 2:26:53.480]  the reptilian brain is basically stupid David let me stop you this is not
[2:26:53.480 --> 2:26:57.000]  debatable about the reptilian brain this is a scientific name
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:27:00.520]  i put it up on the screen google reptilian brain and show them like a
[2:27:00.520 --> 2:27:04.840]  textbook area that's the lower brain that's breathing
[2:27:04.840 --> 2:27:09.560]  sex eating wanting to kill people uh you know i mean that's your
[2:27:09.560 --> 2:27:12.920]  i'm just interrupting you because some may think oh this is david ike and his
[2:27:12.920 --> 2:27:17.240]  you know his other issues with that yeah no no the scientists call it the r
[2:27:17.240 --> 2:27:21.320]  complex or the reptilian brain because um the way it functions and the way it
[2:27:21.320 --> 2:27:25.640]  reacts is almost exactly like the brain of a of a reptile or a lizard
[2:27:25.640 --> 2:27:30.120]  but it is i mean in fact students gives my dad went to medical school
[2:27:30.120 --> 2:27:33.560]  students shown a salt crocodile brain
[2:27:33.560 --> 2:27:37.080]  can't tell the difference between with a human lower brain it
[2:27:37.080 --> 2:27:40.360]  we basically do have a salt crocodile brain go ahead
[2:27:40.360 --> 2:27:44.440]  yeah and and what uh what happens uh is that the
[2:27:44.440 --> 2:27:48.760]  those behind the the dark suits those in the shadows will understand all this
[2:27:48.760 --> 2:27:53.000]  stuff and have worked constantly for centuries to take it out of
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:56.680]  circulation among the people so they're in ignorance of the very
[2:27:56.680 --> 2:27:59.560]  uh means through which they're being manipulated
[2:27:59.560 --> 2:28:03.720]  um they understand this and they target the reptilian brain
[2:28:03.720 --> 2:28:07.960]  the reptilian brain is basically stupid it's a reaction system it is
[2:28:07.960 --> 2:28:11.480]  so computer like it's and is incredible at that level
[2:28:11.480 --> 2:28:16.920]  it you know the brain does just react uh like a computer on the desktop and it
[2:28:16.920 --> 2:28:20.920]  doesn't learn from experience other people other parts of the brain
[2:28:20.920 --> 2:28:24.440]  learn from experience the reptilian brain doesn't it's
[2:28:24.440 --> 2:28:28.600]  its survival instincts are total it's constantly scanning the environment
[2:28:28.600 --> 2:28:33.720]  looking for possible um dangers as it perceives them the idea of the
[2:28:33.720 --> 2:28:37.640]  manipulation is to give the reptilian brain
[2:28:37.640 --> 2:28:43.720]  more and more and more reasons to see things in terms of a threat or a
[2:28:43.720 --> 2:28:47.720]  danger because then all rational thinking disappears
[2:28:47.720 --> 2:28:51.400]  all calm reflection and let's look at this calmly disappears
[2:28:51.400 --> 2:28:55.560]  because the reptilian brain is basically just reacting in a panic
[2:28:55.560 --> 2:28:59.240]  you know save me save me i want me mom that's what it's doing
[2:28:59.240 --> 2:29:02.360]  and and the reptilian brain interestingly if we get into this
[2:29:02.360 --> 2:29:07.240]  uh way that people are programmed communicates through images
[2:29:07.240 --> 2:29:11.160]  this is why images in advertising are so powerful in their manipulation of the
[2:29:11.160 --> 2:29:13.800]  reptilian brain which is you quite rarely point out
[2:29:13.800 --> 2:29:18.920]  is is the sexual center why because with the reptilian brain you have to keep
[2:29:18.920 --> 2:29:22.680]  one word in your mind all the time survival it's all about survival so it
[2:29:22.680 --> 2:29:28.040]  perceives the need for sexual uh uh uh reproduction
[2:29:28.040 --> 2:29:31.560]  as part of its survival that's understandable but also
[2:29:31.560 --> 2:29:36.360]  it sees in the world that we live in money as fundamental to its survival
[2:29:36.360 --> 2:29:40.840]  so the whole money issues that people have the fear of not having money that
[2:29:40.840 --> 2:29:44.440]  the that one thing that this is key sex and money
[2:29:44.440 --> 2:29:47.800]  all of it key information long segment coming up

[2:34:23.480 --> 2:34:27.800]  and they put on this fake liberal facade but they're a bunch of cold-blooded
[2:34:27.800 --> 2:34:31.080]  trash breaking up the family all their major textbooks that we've
[2:34:31.080 --> 2:34:34.680]  shown you here say the families their enemy you know and people say oh they
[2:34:34.680 --> 2:34:37.320]  want to break the family up or oh they want to dumb us down
[2:34:37.320 --> 2:34:40.920]  that isn't just a figment of imagination that's not just
[2:34:40.920 --> 2:34:47.400]  a statement or a verbal fancy
[2:34:47.400 --> 2:34:51.080]  it's the reality and it's a group of humans
[2:34:51.080 --> 2:34:54.920]  setting up a predatory system where they engage in their predator
[2:34:54.920 --> 2:34:58.680]  hunting mode against their own people and they're breeding us and dumbing us
[2:34:58.680 --> 2:35:02.200]  down to be more easily controlled that's what david ike's talking about and when
[2:35:02.200 --> 2:35:06.280]  you know i just took two years of rtf radio television film the first
[2:35:06.280 --> 2:35:09.880]  textbook was all about subliminal messages on radio
[2:35:09.880 --> 2:35:14.360]  80 years ago and tv 60 years ago and in movie theaters and how the billboards
[2:35:14.360 --> 2:35:16.920]  have it and how they use sex to sell and how
[2:35:16.920 --> 2:35:20.600]  they're hitting the reptilian brain this is a fact
[2:35:20.600 --> 2:35:24.440]  and so they're feeding through this virtual matrix
[2:35:24.440 --> 2:35:28.120]  and that's what it is it's not a physical matrix with us in tanks
[2:35:28.120 --> 2:35:31.640]  it's our brain in a tank inside this body suit
[2:35:31.640 --> 2:35:35.240]  being programmed by the false world by the
[2:35:35.240 --> 2:35:39.720]  image makers of television and madison avenue to keep us off the real world in
[2:35:39.720 --> 2:35:43.000]  the whole universe around us through fear
[2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:46.200]  through the desire for money sex survival all of this
[2:35:46.200 --> 2:35:50.200]  but when you do it christ said and turn loose he that gives up his life gains
[2:35:50.200 --> 2:35:53.240]  his life he that tries to save it loses it
[2:35:53.240 --> 2:35:56.440]  that means when you're ready to give it all up and just don't care anymore and
[2:35:56.440 --> 2:35:59.720]  stop letting that program totally control you
[2:35:59.720 --> 2:36:02.840]  then you go to the next level and that doesn't mean we don't bounce back and
[2:36:02.840 --> 2:36:05.720]  forth between the higher mind the cerebral cortex
[2:36:05.720 --> 2:36:09.800]  you know where they say the you know the cognitive in the soul's dwelling and if
[2:36:09.800 --> 2:36:14.120]  you don't believe that fine that's your issue and the the the animal brain
[2:36:14.120 --> 2:36:18.360]  regardless through this electrochemical computer
[2:36:18.360 --> 2:36:22.040]  we are being programmed and manipulated and the establishment brags about it
[2:36:22.040 --> 2:36:25.960]  and they put compulsions and mental blocks in you through culture through
[2:36:25.960 --> 2:36:29.320]  television through the jokes they make on tv
[2:36:29.320 --> 2:36:33.560]  that then are repeated by people on the ground giving it reality
[2:36:33.560 --> 2:36:36.760]  in this plane of existence not in the cyber world
[2:36:36.760 --> 2:36:40.520]  the make believe tv world it's now becoming reality that it's not kosher to
[2:36:40.520 --> 2:36:43.640]  talk about these things and so people are in a
[2:36:43.640 --> 2:36:46.840]  prison for their mind david ike please continue
[2:36:46.840 --> 2:36:50.280]  talking about it but but these paper in front of me and i've just been
[2:36:50.280 --> 2:36:54.280]  ticking off little things uh issues that you
[2:36:54.280 --> 2:36:57.640]  you brought up and um they come under one heading
[2:36:57.640 --> 2:37:01.480]  uh reptilian brain uh from the reptilian brain we get all the survival
[2:37:01.480 --> 2:37:06.600]  mechanisms yes for which break out into multiple different
[2:37:06.600 --> 2:37:09.560]  expressions of what the brain perceives to be uh
[2:37:09.560 --> 2:37:13.400]  necessary to survive from but we get cold-blooded behavior
[2:37:13.400 --> 2:37:18.200]  we get the desire for power over power over comes from survival
[2:37:18.200 --> 2:37:22.040]  the the idea that if you have power over then you've got a much greater chance
[2:37:22.040 --> 2:37:24.520]  of survival it's one where the reptilian brains
[2:37:24.520 --> 2:37:28.840]  where we get a ritual religious behavior i mean these guys um
[2:37:28.840 --> 2:37:33.320]  cause a big time into their satanic rituals but if you look at human society
[2:37:33.320 --> 2:37:39.800]  alex it's it's just a daily uh repeating of ritual repeating
[2:37:39.800 --> 2:37:43.000]  behavior the reptilian brain we get the desire for
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:46.840]  top-down hierarchical structures of power look at the world
[2:37:46.840 --> 2:37:50.200]  it's a it's a an expression of the reptilian brain
[2:37:50.200 --> 2:37:54.680]  you were talking there about you know addictions well addictions come from the
[2:37:54.680 --> 2:37:58.760]  the reptilian brain addiction to money addiction to sex addiction to
[2:37:58.760 --> 2:38:03.240]  to drugs and then you look at the uh the survival
[2:38:03.240 --> 2:38:06.840]  mechanisms and how they play out through problem reaction solution
[2:38:06.840 --> 2:38:10.760]  when they say oh swine flu pandemic
[2:38:10.760 --> 2:38:15.800]  what are they saying that to they're saying it to the survival responses in
[2:38:15.800 --> 2:38:19.880]  the reptilian brain of oh my god survival do something yes
[2:38:19.880 --> 2:38:24.440]  compulsory vaccination if anything terrorism oh yes war on terror
[2:38:24.440 --> 2:38:28.520]  um weapons of mass destruction yes in vatirac oh yes anything oh my god
[2:38:28.520 --> 2:38:32.360]  it's all through the reptilian brain because they understand how it works
[2:38:32.360 --> 2:38:35.880]  and and we need to understand how it works because once we do that
[2:38:35.880 --> 2:38:39.400]  the defense mechanisms start to go up and also we can start to
[2:38:39.400 --> 2:38:43.160]  observe our own behavior when we're reacting to things
[2:38:43.160 --> 2:38:49.880]  in a uh an emotional way without calm uh thinking then
[2:38:49.880 --> 2:38:54.280]  we can stop i mean i've been working on this for for years now in myself
[2:38:54.280 --> 2:38:57.720]  you get halfway through a sentence and you stop and you know you think no
[2:38:57.720 --> 2:38:59.800]  that's the reptilian brain being activated
[2:38:59.800 --> 2:39:03.240]  and what you're doing as you do that as you as you recognize it
[2:39:03.240 --> 2:39:07.160]  is you're stopping it having that reactive power over you that it had
[2:39:07.160 --> 2:39:09.960]  before and you you move into other parts of the
[2:39:09.960 --> 2:39:13.240]  brain in terms of the way that you filter reality and
[2:39:13.240 --> 2:39:17.560]  information and situations and those get more developed you start
[2:39:17.560 --> 2:39:21.000]  seeing the universe more and more through the higher levels of the brain
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:24.520]  and then knowledge just explosively opens where you
[2:39:24.520 --> 2:39:29.240]  can't even describe it well how can you how can you accumulate real
[2:39:29.240 --> 2:39:33.640]  knowledge and awareness when you're spending the day reacting emotionally
[2:39:33.640 --> 2:39:37.160]  uh all the time and you know i would say to people because you know i'm not
[2:39:37.160 --> 2:39:40.520]  sitting cross-legged on a mountain here saying here i'm the i'm the buddha i'm
[2:39:40.520 --> 2:39:45.960]  telling you all how it is and i'm perfect we all have are in these uh
[2:39:45.960 --> 2:39:49.640]  biological computers the question is are we going to let them
[2:39:49.640 --> 2:39:53.000]  live us are we going to live them are we going to live life or we're going to
[2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:56.280]  allow life to live us because most people allow life to live them because of
[2:39:56.280 --> 2:39:59.640]  these reactive processes that's what john carpenter
[2:39:59.640 --> 2:40:04.520]  is saying is they live the controllers we sleep
[2:40:04.520 --> 2:40:09.000]  we're sleeping when we're in the reptilian brain also tied into sleep
[2:40:09.000 --> 2:40:15.080]  we are unconscious we're really dead and they live it's all a big joke to them
[2:40:15.080 --> 2:40:21.320]  yeah and if we can start to take control of our reactions
[2:40:21.320 --> 2:40:25.000]  and and and when you kind of come from this point of view and you
[2:40:25.000 --> 2:40:29.000]  just um observe yourself for a few days uh just
[2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:32.600]  observe yourself in the way you react and you'll see how many
[2:40:32.600 --> 2:40:38.280]  conflicts between individuals arguments um uh emotional responses that are
[2:40:38.280 --> 2:40:41.880]  right over the top uh and and uh the way that we immediately
[2:40:41.880 --> 2:40:45.880]  react to something instead of saying hold on a second take a deep breath
[2:40:45.880 --> 2:40:48.200]  let's just calmly look at this before we start making instant
[2:40:48.200 --> 2:40:51.560]  decisions um when you when you do that you realize
[2:40:51.560 --> 2:40:55.400]  how many times a day the reptilian brain decides
[2:40:55.400 --> 2:40:59.480]  your decisions for you it's unbelievable the number of times it happens
[2:40:59.480 --> 2:41:02.360]  and collectively of course there's a collective version of this where you
[2:41:02.360 --> 2:41:04.600]  have the mob rule and all the rest of it
[2:41:04.600 --> 2:41:08.840]  where the reptilian brain happens is manipulated collectively to have a
[2:41:08.840 --> 2:41:13.720]  collective response and emotional reaction and we've got to get control of
[2:41:13.720 --> 2:41:17.240]  the computer system through our consciousness
[2:41:17.240 --> 2:41:20.600]  instead of um having our consciousness at the back of the bus and the computer
[2:41:20.600 --> 2:41:23.240]  system with its hands on the wheel because that's what the conspiracy is
[2:41:23.240 --> 2:41:27.000]  about while we're there they got us when we're not there
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:29.880]  they've lost their their ability to connect into us and therefore
[2:41:29.880 --> 2:41:34.360]  manipulate our perceptions all right let me expand on that
[2:41:34.360 --> 2:41:37.000]  because this has been scientifically proven as you know but for listeners who
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:40.600]  may not buy thousands of universities for over a hundred years
[2:41:40.600 --> 2:41:46.760]  that mice and other animals know when a hurricane or an earthquake is coming
[2:41:46.760 --> 2:41:51.640]  days or sometimes weeks beforehand they can also do double-blind studies where
[2:41:51.640 --> 2:41:55.000]  there's a 20-foot wall you can't hear what's going on the next room
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:58.920]  but if people are agitated in the next room or being hurt
[2:41:58.920 --> 2:42:04.920]  brainwaves uh you know go into a a a a a a a pattern of this array or being
[2:42:04.920 --> 2:42:10.120]  upset yourself kind of that hundredth monkey and the the system
[2:42:10.120 --> 2:42:14.920]  is trying to suppress this awakening uh or you know I mean just in
[2:42:14.920 --> 2:42:19.560]  scientific terms from people being you know in a higher level uh
[2:42:19.560 --> 2:42:22.760]  when it comes to the use of their brain so that's why they're putting the
[2:42:22.760 --> 2:42:25.320]  fluoride in the water that's why they're injecting us with mercury
[2:42:25.320 --> 2:42:29.080]  that's why they're feeding us the gmo food all of this
[2:42:29.080 --> 2:42:32.360]  that's why the television's dumbing everything down lowering everything
[2:42:32.360 --> 2:42:37.400]  down uh how do you see this battle shaking out
[2:42:37.400 --> 2:42:40.840]  david ike well if we if we don't become conscious
[2:42:40.840 --> 2:42:45.560]  and get out of control by computer uh uh programs
[2:42:45.560 --> 2:42:49.560]  then it's going to go on because the the computer programs are going to keep
[2:42:49.560 --> 2:42:53.080]  following the program this is why it's so important that no matter what our
[2:42:53.080 --> 2:42:57.400]  religious or non-religious or or or belief for anything
[2:42:57.400 --> 2:43:02.040]  but we we put that aside and and and look at the things that unite us instead
[2:43:02.040 --> 2:43:05.080]  of those that divide us like i said a few minutes ago i'd actually know
[2:43:05.080 --> 2:43:08.600]  we have all these religions who argue and cuss and fight
[2:43:08.600 --> 2:43:12.840]  but when you get to the core of them uh the real core of them they're not a
[2:43:12.840 --> 2:43:15.160]  million miles from what i'm talking about here
[2:43:15.160 --> 2:43:18.760]  if you get it down to the you know we people can argue about the detail i'd
[2:43:18.760 --> 2:43:21.240]  see why we should argue about the detail i mean you know believe what you like
[2:43:21.240 --> 2:43:23.400]  for long you don't force on anyone else but
[2:43:23.400 --> 2:43:28.200]  you know the basics of we are something beyond the body and when the body dies
[2:43:28.200 --> 2:43:32.120]  that something leaves what which i call awareness other people call the soul
[2:43:32.120 --> 2:43:35.720]  um if we can start to get down up to these levels where we all
[2:43:35.720 --> 2:43:39.080]  basically agree then we can start working together
[2:43:39.080 --> 2:43:43.880]  without letting the fault lines of detail uh and and and religious uh
[2:43:43.880 --> 2:43:49.400]  dogma um divide us and and we need to to move our point of observation from the
[2:43:49.400 --> 2:43:53.560]  body instead of looking in the mirror and saying that is me
[2:43:53.560 --> 2:43:57.320]  um it's looking in the mirror and saying that is the vehicle that the real me
[2:43:57.320 --> 2:44:00.520]  consciousness is using to explore and experience this reality see once you
[2:44:00.520 --> 2:44:03.800]  once you once you oh well we we have names so we can
[2:44:03.800 --> 2:44:06.600]  tell each other apart when we're in the world that we live in
[2:44:06.600 --> 2:44:10.600]  but you can have a name without without actually um being completely uh
[2:44:10.600 --> 2:44:14.200]  uh controlled uh by the fact that that's who you are
[2:44:14.200 --> 2:44:17.480]  see um i don't consider myself to be david ike that's the name of an
[2:44:17.480 --> 2:44:21.640]  experience i'm having now um at this time i am consciousness
[2:44:21.640 --> 2:44:25.320]  having that experience and when you when you come from from that
[2:44:25.320 --> 2:44:29.240]  point of view you don't get pulled into little me
[2:44:29.240 --> 2:44:32.280]  in other words you don't get pulled into computer level of
[2:44:32.280 --> 2:44:39.480]  that's it i gotta stop you exactly whenever i'm calm focused i can think
[2:44:39.480 --> 2:44:42.200]  a thousand times faster everything makes complete sense
[2:44:42.200 --> 2:44:46.040]  by the very nature of getting on the air having the lights on
[2:44:46.040 --> 2:44:49.320]  having the stress of having to perform i shift in
[2:44:49.320 --> 2:44:53.880]  to the you know fighter flight into the reptilian brain
[2:44:53.880 --> 2:44:58.200]  and then lose so much of my consciousness just even when i get on air
[2:44:58.200 --> 2:45:02.200]  instead of like at 10 or 11 12 at night when everything is so clear
[2:45:02.200 --> 2:45:06.280]  and it's just amazing but but you know
[2:45:06.280 --> 2:45:09.240]  what you just talked about whenever i get above it all
[2:45:09.240 --> 2:45:12.360]  then i don't hate my enemies that are attacking me and lying about me actually
[2:45:12.360 --> 2:45:15.800]  feel sorry for them and wish that they weren't
[2:45:15.800 --> 2:45:20.840]  you know at such a primitive uh level but then i also realize we can't do
[2:45:20.840 --> 2:45:23.480]  like some people in the east that get so
[2:45:23.480 --> 2:45:27.960]  into higher awareness that they stop caring even if their body's dying or
[2:45:27.960 --> 2:45:33.880]  they're sitting there homeless under a tree we have to have balance between
[2:45:33.880 --> 2:45:40.200]  the two levels because uh give people lose the
[2:45:40.200 --> 2:45:44.360]  will to even survive at this plane of existence
[2:45:44.360 --> 2:45:47.240]  then that i see also is a great danger here's an example
[2:45:47.240 --> 2:45:52.200]  you spray cockroaches with poison any uh exterminator will tell you this
[2:45:52.200 --> 2:45:55.320]  as soon as they get hit by poison they start having sex
[2:45:55.320 --> 2:45:59.640]  trying to uh to fertilize their eggs and it's just
[2:45:59.640 --> 2:46:03.160]  like after 9 11 there was a huge baby boom that was the
[2:46:03.160 --> 2:46:06.920]  establishment did a threat to the species grand event
[2:46:06.920 --> 2:46:11.080]  or our tribe just got devastated people immediately myself included
[2:46:11.080 --> 2:46:13.800]  went and got married or having children not even knowing why
[2:46:13.800 --> 2:46:18.280]  it was a compulsion of the species which are all interconnected and tied
[2:46:18.280 --> 2:46:21.080]  together you know we're all individuals but we're also part of a
[2:46:21.080 --> 2:46:26.040]  hive species almost like a jellyfish colony and so
[2:46:26.040 --> 2:46:29.800]  i mean david i'm throwing out a lot of ideas here the point i'm trying to make
[2:46:29.800 --> 2:46:35.960]  is that there we can also and i haven't done this
[2:46:35.960 --> 2:46:38.840]  consciously but now that i'm more conscious i can realize i did
[2:46:38.840 --> 2:46:42.200]  i've been successful with people waking them up to the first level
[2:46:42.200 --> 2:46:46.840]  because i did at a reptilian primitive level explain you have been enslaved
[2:46:46.840 --> 2:46:51.640]  there is more outside this system than you know but then now more and more i
[2:46:51.640 --> 2:46:54.600]  realize that when you do open up the entire
[2:46:54.600 --> 2:46:57.960]  universe and the majesty of the clouds and the stars
[2:46:57.960 --> 2:47:01.240]  and life and that your soul is looking out these windows
[2:47:01.240 --> 2:47:04.520]  and when i look at another person i'm looking at another soul and their
[2:47:04.520 --> 2:47:07.480]  entire genetic line and all those levels almost like a
[2:47:07.480 --> 2:47:10.440]  symbiotic organism is what i'm beginning to realize we are
[2:47:10.440 --> 2:47:14.760]  you know more than i mean i mean it's it's so incredible to open up to the
[2:47:14.760 --> 2:47:18.200]  entire universe and i agree with when you open up to that then
[2:47:18.200 --> 2:47:21.000]  you realize how ridiculous the new order is but still
[2:47:21.000 --> 2:47:24.840]  they are physically at this level hurting people and it's a test for the
[2:47:24.840 --> 2:47:28.680]  higher level to come down into the lower level and deal with this because
[2:47:28.680 --> 2:47:31.800]  almost when you get tied into the higher level you don't even want to be part of
[2:47:31.800 --> 2:47:35.080]  the world anymore but it's almost like god sending
[2:47:35.080 --> 2:47:38.360]  christ down to the earth to experience this in the flesh
[2:47:38.360 --> 2:47:42.040]  so do you understand what i'm saying david well you know i don't think we come
[2:47:42.040 --> 2:47:45.800]  into this world to then ignore the fact we've done so this is why we need the
[2:47:45.800 --> 2:47:50.200]  balance you've got uh people like uh it was called
[2:47:50.200 --> 2:47:53.800]  the new age movement and much of that was brilliantly described in a book i read
[2:47:53.800 --> 2:47:57.560]  a long time ago as uh people who were in a holding
[2:47:57.560 --> 2:48:03.640]  pattern above the airport refusing to land and i i i i there's a lot of um
[2:48:03.640 --> 2:48:10.520]  people that are in denial of what they need to do to make a difference um
[2:48:10.520 --> 2:48:14.520]  because they are using the thing of oh it's it's all all higher consciousness and
[2:48:14.520 --> 2:48:19.640]  all the rest of it and for me um what we need to do is bring that
[2:48:19.640 --> 2:48:23.400]  higher awareness um into the body computer because
[2:48:23.400 --> 2:48:27.960]  you know they can uh manipulate and program the body computer through the
[2:48:27.960 --> 2:48:32.440]  media through education through electrochemical means and they do all
[2:48:32.440 --> 2:48:36.520]  the time that that's the bottom line so we have to occupy the reptilian brain
[2:48:36.520 --> 2:48:39.800]  with the higher consciousness or they're always going to use it as a
[2:48:39.800 --> 2:48:43.480]  as a breach at the point i'm i'm i'm making here alex is
[2:48:43.480 --> 2:48:48.280]  we can program the computer from a from consciousness if consciousness um is
[2:48:48.280 --> 2:48:51.880]  allowed in and what does that mean it means opening the mind
[2:48:51.880 --> 2:48:55.400]  of a key thing i would say um is that from from
[2:48:55.400 --> 2:49:00.120]  the words that i i terms i'm using anyway the mind and consciousness are not the
[2:49:00.120 --> 2:49:04.760]  same thing the mind is is like a it's like an
[2:49:04.760 --> 2:49:09.480]  interface you see i'm sitting here now and in an office and if i want to go on
[2:49:09.480 --> 2:49:12.760]  the internet i can't just go on the internet i've got to go in on the
[2:49:12.760 --> 2:49:17.400]  internet through a computer that's my interface that allows me to experience
[2:49:17.400 --> 2:49:20.280]  the collective reality we call the worldwide web
[2:49:20.280 --> 2:49:24.680]  however um uh when i'm uh consciousness soul whatever you want to
[2:49:24.680 --> 2:49:28.360]  talk about it and i want to experience and and make a contribution to this
[2:49:28.360 --> 2:49:32.040]  reality i need an interface and that interface is mind
[2:49:32.040 --> 2:49:36.360]  and the mind is fundamentally part of the the the body computer system body
[2:49:36.360 --> 2:49:40.600]  mind they are different facets of each other and and what the uh
[2:49:40.600 --> 2:49:44.040]  illuminati are about is programming the mind
[2:49:44.040 --> 2:49:49.720]  and and you you talked earlier about um the way that people are using
[2:49:49.720 --> 2:49:53.720]  fewer and fewer words and and are speaking slower and all the rest of it
[2:49:53.720 --> 2:50:00.280]  this is all part of um programming uh people's not just ability to express
[2:50:00.280 --> 2:50:04.600]  themselves in words but their ability to express even their
[2:50:04.600 --> 2:50:07.720]  thoughts see on the level of consciousness
[2:50:07.720 --> 2:50:11.400]  we um become aware through something called knowing
[2:50:11.400 --> 2:50:14.760]  don't think it know it consciousness knows because it is
[2:50:14.760 --> 2:50:18.440]  it is the the the one consciousness the the all that is
[2:50:18.440 --> 2:50:22.600]  the mind uh the body mind computer system that
[2:50:22.600 --> 2:50:28.040]  thinks that's the blooming um uh chatter that goes on on in your head 24
[2:50:28.040 --> 2:50:31.160]  seven and never shuts up and says stupid things do you think why am i
[2:50:31.160 --> 2:50:34.280]  thinking that well you're not actually thinking at the body computer is
[2:50:34.280 --> 2:50:38.680]  and and that is it thinks in words it you know
[2:50:38.680 --> 2:50:42.040]  think now anybody listen to this show and you're thinking in words
[2:50:42.040 --> 2:50:46.360]  the more you remove words generation after generation
[2:50:46.360 --> 2:50:49.800]  detailed words that can express a real detailed thought
[2:50:49.800 --> 2:50:54.120]  you're you're removing the ability even to think in detail
[2:50:54.120 --> 2:50:57.720]  because these are symbols used in the brain to construct
[2:50:57.720 --> 2:51:01.720]  that mental image we'll be right back with david i pretty powerful stuff
[2:51:01.720 --> 2:51:05.240]  more than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water
[2:51:05.240 --> 2:51:08.360]  and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while
[2:51:08.360 --> 2:51:10.680]  taking hot showers than when drinking the water
[2:51:10.680 --> 2:51:14.200]  that's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others
[2:51:14.200 --> 2:51:17.480]  are absorbed into the skin the kdf dual media shower
[2:51:17.480 --> 2:51:21.400]  filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine
[2:51:21.400 --> 2:51:25.320]  lead mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria
[2:51:25.320 --> 2:51:29.400]  mold algae and fungus the kdf dual media shower filter typically
[2:51:29.400 --> 2:51:32.600]  lasts 10 000 gallons or one year whichever comes first
[2:51:32.600 --> 2:51:35.960]  hospitals restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to
[2:51:35.960 --> 2:51:38.840]  reduce chlorine iron heavy metals and bacteria
[2:51:38.840 --> 2:51:41.720]  what about you order your kdf shower filter normally

[2:54:40.680 --> 2:54:44.120]  themselves all I want to do is take blinders off people I don't claim they're
[2:54:44.120 --> 2:54:48.600]  going to see what I see I don't claim I have all the answers I just know this
[2:54:48.600 --> 2:54:53.480]  consciousness this universe is unbelievable I mean I just literally
[2:54:53.480 --> 2:54:58.840]  commune with it it is so every moment is exhilarating and it's torture
[2:54:58.840 --> 2:55:02.360]  to be here and to have to focus on the new world order and deal with it
[2:55:02.360 --> 2:55:05.560]  but at the same time we are never going to defeat these people as David said
[2:55:05.560 --> 2:55:07.560]  during the break to me said Alex we've got to go
[2:55:07.560 --> 2:55:11.640]  into this world we've got to be of this world
[2:55:11.640 --> 2:55:15.080]  in the world but not of it and we've got to be able to be in this world be able
[2:55:15.080 --> 2:55:18.520]  to get people by the hand and pull them out of it and does that mean we're
[2:55:18.520 --> 2:55:22.280]  perfect no we're just aware there's something else
[2:55:22.280 --> 2:55:25.480]  and as I said knowing is half the battle but don't forget the online video
[2:55:25.480 --> 2:55:28.600]  bookstore at info wars.com if you want to get the obama deception
[2:55:28.600 --> 2:55:31.720]  if you want to get truth rising or any of the books and films we carry
[2:55:31.720 --> 2:55:37.320]  info wars.com or 888-253-3139 be sure and peruse that
[2:55:37.320 --> 2:55:41.480]  while you're at it also folks can peruse davidike.com a lot of really
[2:55:41.480 --> 2:55:44.680]  interesting mind-blowing stuff from one of the great
[2:55:44.680 --> 2:55:50.360]  philosophers and minds of our day David Ike who was a former top champion
[2:55:50.360 --> 2:55:53.320]  world goalie before that and bbc news presenter
[2:55:53.320 --> 2:55:56.760]  and sports presenter and best-selling author davidike.com
[2:55:56.760 --> 2:56:00.680]  David you said you're working on a new book tell us about that yeah well I
[2:56:00.680 --> 2:56:04.920]  you know my journey is is over the last 20 years
[2:56:04.920 --> 2:56:08.280]  has you know gone through so many levels with
[2:56:08.280 --> 2:56:11.800]  all the five cents manipulation of engineered wars and
[2:56:11.800 --> 2:56:14.920]  and banking scammers and all the rest of it and then into
[2:56:14.920 --> 2:56:19.560]  deeper areas and there's come a point you know
[2:56:19.560 --> 2:56:22.760]  every day at the moment is a joy as I'm writing this because
[2:56:22.760 --> 2:56:28.600]  the insights are just coming so fast because you reach a point where
[2:56:28.600 --> 2:56:32.200]  so many dots start to connect on all these different levels and
[2:56:32.200 --> 2:56:36.760]  and you start to see you know how deep the rabbit hole really goes
[2:56:36.760 --> 2:56:40.600]  and what's good about it is it it's not just that it
[2:56:40.600 --> 2:56:44.280]  shows you how they manipulate us it shows you how we can stop them
[2:56:44.280 --> 2:56:49.000]  manipulating us and now we can take power of our over our reality back
[2:56:49.000 --> 2:56:53.080]  by reversing what they've done because consciousness is all powerful you know
[2:56:53.080 --> 2:56:58.520]  the illuminati is is a fly on an elephant's back to consciousness
[2:56:58.520 --> 2:57:03.080]  but the problem is we don't let consciousness in we we work on at the
[2:57:03.080 --> 2:57:05.880]  level of the body computer's sense of reality
[2:57:05.880 --> 2:57:10.440]  and to that the illuminati is not like a fly on the elephant's back
[2:57:10.440 --> 2:57:13.640]  so we let consciousness in by opening our minds
[2:57:13.640 --> 2:57:17.720]  and bingo things start to change massively the world starts to change
[2:57:17.720 --> 2:57:22.040]  because the world is a reflection of us and at the moment because we constantly
[2:57:22.040 --> 2:57:25.480]  give our power away we constantly think in terms of little me
[2:57:25.480 --> 2:57:29.480]  we live in a world in which the mass of the population constantly has no power
[2:57:29.480 --> 2:57:32.680]  and sees itself as little me when we change that
[2:57:32.680 --> 2:57:36.040]  self-perception that awareness of self from
[2:57:36.040 --> 2:57:40.360]  Charlie Jones who I am infinite consciousness having an experience as
[2:57:40.360 --> 2:57:43.960]  Charlie Jones then suddenly Charlie Jones starts to act and
[2:57:43.960 --> 2:57:47.880]  perceive in a totally different way that makes it much much more difficult to
[2:57:47.880 --> 2:57:51.000]  control and manipulate his reality and therefore his behavior
[2:57:51.000 --> 2:57:57.560]  and therefore his life absolutely now I don't believe that we are in a
[2:57:57.560 --> 2:58:01.560]  physical matrix living in little tanks with you know
[2:58:01.560 --> 2:58:05.320]  reptoid robots running around all over us but that came from
[2:58:05.320 --> 2:58:09.800]  1968 government documents declassified in 2000
[2:58:09.800 --> 2:58:13.080]  and clearly those movies came out before that and so they were having the
[2:58:13.080 --> 2:58:17.160]  information fed to them that is what the Pentagon says they want to build
[2:58:17.160 --> 2:58:20.200]  because for a control freak somebody from the reptilian level
[2:58:20.200 --> 2:58:24.040]  if everybody is encased in styrofoam for their own safety
[2:58:24.040 --> 2:58:27.320]  having perception fed to them through a wire
[2:58:27.320 --> 2:58:31.640]  then that's not tyranny that's just another reality
[2:58:31.640 --> 2:58:34.440]  so I want to elaborate on this idea when we come back
[2:58:34.440 --> 2:58:38.200]  okay whereas we are in a matrix in that our brain
[2:58:38.200 --> 2:58:41.800]  is perceiving all this stay with us
[2:58:41.800 --> 2:58:51.240]  thank you for listening to GCN be sure to visit gcnlive.com today
[2:58:51.240 --> 2:58:55.240]  many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the united

[2:59:52.360 --> 3:00:11.160]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[3:00:11.160 --> 3:00:15.880]  what are you you are a species that lives on a planet two-thirds of the
[3:00:15.880 --> 3:00:19.960]  whale the spiral arm of what we call the build a galaxy
[3:00:19.960 --> 3:00:23.400]  we're in a now eight planet that don't count Pluto but
[3:00:23.400 --> 3:00:30.440]  a nine planet solar system orbiting a very average sun
[3:00:30.440 --> 3:00:37.560]  and what we know of our history it probably has no reflection to the truth
[3:00:37.560 --> 3:00:41.320]  we have a sense of ourselves is very important and
[3:00:41.320 --> 3:00:45.880]  of having an ancient history we have a you know they call it delusions of
[3:00:45.880 --> 3:00:50.600]  grandeur but really it's a sense of wonderment
[3:00:50.600 --> 3:00:54.920]  as being part of an infinite universe and they want to narrow our perception
[3:00:54.920 --> 3:00:59.080]  they want to keep us small and focused and fearful and petty
[3:00:59.080 --> 3:01:02.600]  because then when we're focused in on that we don't see the wider
[3:01:02.600 --> 3:01:06.520]  universe and we're basically in change so
[3:01:06.520 --> 3:01:10.040]  i'm sure david's seen these it's in my book to send to tyranny but i know he's
[3:01:10.040 --> 3:01:12.920]  seen thousands of documents and articles i mentioned a few stories to him
[3:01:12.920 --> 3:01:15.800]  during a break and he was aware of all of them we're going to talk about later
[3:01:15.800 --> 3:01:20.520]  dealing with why he can't really go to Canada and why i can't but
[3:01:20.520 --> 3:01:23.960]  side issue trying to bring in this physical tyranny so they can bring in
[3:01:23.960 --> 3:01:27.720]  the drug tyranny the brainwashing tyranny to affect the mind
[3:01:27.720 --> 3:01:31.800]  that's really in the prison so they're bringing in a physical prison but also
[3:01:31.800 --> 3:01:35.640]  a mental prison but david we really are in a matrix
[3:01:35.640 --> 3:01:40.360]  of perception when we realize it is a brain with all these multifaceted
[3:01:40.360 --> 3:01:43.880]  layers and then our eyes are just brain stems
[3:01:43.880 --> 3:01:50.040]  looking out at the this small spectrum of reality as you say and others say
[3:01:50.040 --> 3:01:55.000]  and so it's competing matrices either we take control of the matrix
[3:01:55.000 --> 3:01:58.600]  or the establishment takes control of the matrix and because we've not been
[3:01:58.600 --> 3:02:02.520]  aware of the matrix they are in control of it is that what you're saying
[3:02:02.520 --> 3:02:06.040]  well what i would say is this um you know there's been
[3:02:06.040 --> 3:02:09.400]  uh many scientists over the years who've speculated that
[3:02:09.400 --> 3:02:14.280]  this reality needs an observer to be as we perceive it
[3:02:14.280 --> 3:02:17.880]  and i would say they were absolutely right and the evidence is overwhelming
[3:02:17.880 --> 3:02:24.840]  that that's true um if you think of radio stations
[3:02:24.840 --> 3:02:31.320]  and television stations and you tune the radio to a certain station
[3:02:31.320 --> 3:02:35.320]  that's the station you get so if you want to control
[3:02:35.320 --> 3:02:42.600]  the sense of perception and the experience and daily life
[3:02:42.600 --> 3:02:46.600]  of a symbolic radio then you need to control
[3:02:46.600 --> 3:02:53.800]  what it's tuned to and we are constantly receiving and
[3:02:53.800 --> 3:02:57.480]  transmitting information through the body computer this is why you know it's
[3:02:57.480 --> 3:03:02.680]  it's massively a crystalline entity organism because it's a
[3:03:02.680 --> 3:03:06.280]  receiver transmitter of information the dna is a receiver transmitters
[3:03:06.280 --> 3:03:09.240]  or every cell and we have trillions of them
[3:03:09.240 --> 3:03:12.840]  have receiver transmitters we're a receiver transmitter
[3:03:12.840 --> 3:03:19.240]  uh extraordinary but as with the radio if you can control the
[3:03:19.240 --> 3:03:23.880]  what you what it receives you controlling what it perceives
[3:03:23.880 --> 3:03:30.760]  and all the time we are being um bombarded with programs that dictate
[3:03:30.760 --> 3:03:36.120]  the way the body computer um reads and decodes reality because this
[3:03:36.120 --> 3:03:39.480]  this universe that we see is um solid and physical
[3:03:39.480 --> 3:03:42.440]  only exists in our in our head when it's decoded
[3:03:42.440 --> 3:03:46.200]  it's exactly the same principle as uh playing software
[3:03:46.200 --> 3:03:52.280]  on um a computer um and it reads the software now the software has no
[3:03:52.280 --> 3:03:55.480]  pictures on it it has no websites on it has no text on it
[3:03:55.480 --> 3:03:59.240]  it's just information but the computer reads that information
[3:03:59.240 --> 3:04:03.800]  and projects it on the screen as words pictures
[3:04:03.800 --> 3:04:07.720]  websites a collective reality we call the the internet or whatever else is on
[3:04:07.720 --> 3:04:12.680]  the on the um on the disk and um that's what we're doing the
[3:04:12.680 --> 3:04:18.920]  prime level of this matrix is vibrational this is why if you look at
[3:04:18.920 --> 3:04:21.640]  any absolutely anything no matter how solid it is
[3:04:21.640 --> 3:04:25.400]  through a powerful enough microscope you'll see bright vibrating energy
[3:04:25.400 --> 3:04:29.560]  if you um if you look at the inside of atoms which
[3:04:29.560 --> 3:04:34.040]  supposed to be the the the solid things if you like to make up the solid world
[3:04:34.040 --> 3:04:37.480]  they have no solidity the deeper and deeper you go into them eventually it
[3:04:37.480 --> 3:04:41.240]  becomes just space or empty space or what we perceive as empty space
[3:04:41.240 --> 3:04:44.280]  so what with what the body computer is doing
[3:04:44.280 --> 3:04:47.800]  through the five senses is turning that vibrational information into
[3:04:47.800 --> 3:04:50.680]  electrical information which is transmitted to the brain
[3:04:50.680 --> 3:04:54.600]  that constructs that information into this holographic reality it's like a
[3:04:54.600 --> 3:04:57.800]  computer leading me into that all right david stay there got a break long
[3:04:57.800 --> 3:05:01.080]  segment coming up this is a very important information
[3:05:01.080 --> 3:05:04.520]  this is alex jones and i want to tell you again about a company that has
[3:05:04.520 --> 3:05:06.920]  supported us in the truth movement for years

[3:06:04.440 --> 3:06:07.720]  buying a solar power generator this summer number one new climate
[3:06:07.720 --> 3:06:10.440]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[3:06:10.440 --> 3:06:14.520]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[3:06:14.520 --> 3:06:18.440]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[3:06:18.440 --> 3:06:21.400]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[3:06:21.400 --> 3:06:25.080]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[3:06:25.080 --> 3:06:27.960]  overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[3:06:27.960 --> 3:06:31.560]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again
[3:06:31.560 --> 3:06:34.600]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[3:06:34.600 --> 3:06:37.800]  outages number five a solar power generator provides
[3:06:37.800 --> 3:06:41.640]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar
[3:06:41.640 --> 3:06:45.640]  power generators offered by solution from science a long time sponsor of ours
[3:06:45.640 --> 3:06:50.360]  you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[3:06:50.360 --> 3:06:54.680]  that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun yet

[3:07:01.720 --> 3:07:06.840]  attention an important product from hempusa.org micro plant powder will
[3:07:06.840 --> 3:07:11.080]  change your life by removing all types of positive toxins such as heavy
[3:07:11.080 --> 3:07:15.320]  metals parasites bacteria viruses and fungus from the digestive tract in
[3:07:15.320 --> 3:07:19.560]  stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients micro plant powder is 89
[3:07:19.560 --> 3:07:22.600]  percent silica and packed with a negative charge that
[3:07:22.600 --> 3:07:26.440]  attracts positive toxins from the blood organ spine and brain
[3:07:26.440 --> 3:07:29.960]  this product has the ability to rebuild cartilagin bone which allows
[3:07:29.960 --> 3:07:34.360]  synovial fluid to return to the joints silica is a precursor to calcium
[3:07:34.360 --> 3:07:38.200]  meaning the body turns silica into calcium and is great for the heart
[3:07:38.200 --> 3:07:42.680]  there is no better time than now to have micro plant powder on your shelf or in

[3:08:05.080 --> 3:08:10.040]  alex jones on the gcn radio network
[3:08:18.760 --> 3:08:21.960]  your calls are coming up with david ike he's been very very nice to give us two
[3:08:21.960 --> 3:08:24.360]  hours today we're very very thankful to tell you about something speaking
[3:08:24.360 --> 3:08:27.320]  engagements that are coming up here in just a moment so get your pen and
[3:08:27.320 --> 3:08:29.720]  paper ready we're talking to the folks involved with
[3:08:29.720 --> 3:08:33.320]  the 2012 film that's all i can say i'm not even allowed to show the revision
[3:08:33.320 --> 3:08:36.600]  numbers of this but i have the 2012 script with woody
[3:08:36.600 --> 3:08:39.480]  harrelson i will just tell you that i just came in
[3:08:39.480 --> 3:08:43.800]  the mail i want to thank folks for that also want to thank
[3:08:43.800 --> 3:08:49.000]  people for this bob in spokane washington said
[3:08:49.000 --> 3:08:56.360]  god bless you alex jones i thought of you and what you do
[3:08:56.360 --> 3:09:01.080]  the info warrior i'm an info warrior myself i hear you talk about the tip of
[3:09:01.080 --> 3:09:05.720]  the spear this is a real indian spear and i had to give it to you
[3:09:05.720 --> 3:09:10.200]  may god bless you and your family and you can always tell the real ones
[3:09:10.200 --> 3:09:13.160]  because of the craftsmanship and the slower way they did it
[3:09:13.160 --> 3:09:17.480]  versus the factory made ones i don't know how prehistoric this is but it's got
[3:09:17.480 --> 3:09:21.080]  the look of a prehistoric because my grandfather gave my dad some
[3:09:21.080 --> 3:09:26.280]  spearheads much like this very very valuable gift i will put this
[3:09:26.280 --> 3:09:29.960]  in a little stand i've got at my house with little treasures thank you for
[3:09:29.960 --> 3:09:33.640]  this gift the listeners are just so amazing out there god bless you
[3:09:33.640 --> 3:09:36.920]  i will always keep it in treasure it gotta keep away from my kids though
[3:09:36.920 --> 3:09:40.040]  they'll break it i broke some of my dad's when i was growing up
[3:09:40.040 --> 3:09:44.360]  going back to david i uh david
[3:09:44.360 --> 3:09:47.480]  uh you got cut off there talking about the frequency talking about how the
[3:09:47.480 --> 3:09:50.840]  globalists the controllers keep us dialed into one point
[3:09:50.840 --> 3:09:55.480]  how do you see their neural order plan their goals to build this
[3:09:55.480 --> 3:09:58.440]  extermination grid this planetary government then carry out the
[3:09:58.440 --> 3:10:02.440]  population reduction to me it looks like things aren't going well for them
[3:10:02.440 --> 3:10:06.760]  we're having victory after victory and that there's an awakening accelerating
[3:10:06.760 --> 3:10:10.040]  now i know that they're going to counter strike and things are going to be rough
[3:10:10.040 --> 3:10:14.600]  and we're all going to be tested uh but am i somewhat
[3:10:14.600 --> 3:10:17.640]  in in in your expert opinion do you think i'm
[3:10:17.640 --> 3:10:22.360]  too close to the fact that we are going to win in the end and then i have a lot
[3:10:22.360 --> 3:10:26.760]  of faith because i'm deeper into this and and is that distorting my vision
[3:10:26.760 --> 3:10:31.160]  in your opinion that so many others aren't awake yet or going deeper
[3:10:31.160 --> 3:10:37.800]  into the control uh and so and so i'm skewing my view uh because i know the
[3:10:37.800 --> 3:10:41.160]  neural orders already lost because they don't control the entire universe or i
[3:10:41.160 --> 3:10:45.160]  mean do you get the point i'm making yeah i i've never doubted that it was a
[3:10:45.160 --> 3:10:51.160]  turnout of fine in the end um but the nature of the manipulation and the
[3:10:51.160 --> 3:10:54.600]  programming means that um a lot of people have
[3:10:54.600 --> 3:10:58.360]  got to go a long way down the road before they actually see it
[3:10:58.360 --> 3:11:02.360]  and it's a case of how deeply programmed you are before you
[3:11:02.360 --> 3:11:06.680]  you you you actually see it and and and start to realize what's happening
[3:11:06.680 --> 3:11:11.880]  and what i've seen over the last 20 years is an exponential curve without
[3:11:11.880 --> 3:11:15.720]  any question of people who are starting to get it they're starting to get it and
[3:11:15.720 --> 3:11:19.080]  bigger and bigger and bigger numbers and what i find interesting is they're
[3:11:19.080 --> 3:11:21.800]  starting to get it at higher levels immediately
[3:11:21.800 --> 3:11:26.280]  um from from uh uh uh being in the program to to
[3:11:26.280 --> 3:11:29.720]  seeing well outside of the program is taking very little time for some people
[3:11:29.720 --> 3:11:34.520]  now um there is something going on and the first book i ever wrote on the
[3:11:34.520 --> 3:11:38.840]  these subjects was nearly 20 years ago called truth vibrations
[3:11:38.840 --> 3:11:42.520]  and it was um named truth vibrations because it was
[3:11:42.520 --> 3:11:45.720]  based on the fact that i was understanding at the time
[3:11:45.720 --> 3:11:50.280]  that there was a vibrational change coming that was going to act like an
[3:11:50.280 --> 3:11:53.960]  alarm clock it was going to wake them up it was going to tease open their mind
[3:11:53.960 --> 3:11:57.640]  so consciousness could enter and at the time of course i'm thinking well
[3:11:57.640 --> 3:12:01.080]  there's no evidence of this whatsoever and it wasn't for a few years
[3:12:01.080 --> 3:12:05.160]  but with the turn into the 21st century i'm seeing it
[3:12:05.160 --> 3:12:09.240]  happening more and more and more and it needs to happen that this is this is the
[3:12:09.240 --> 3:12:13.400]  the way we're going to turn this around but they're going to uh push it
[3:12:13.400 --> 3:12:17.640]  obviously uh as much as they can uh to to to get their
[3:12:17.640 --> 3:12:22.840]  structure in place but i do sense um a feeling of of the increasing panic
[3:12:22.840 --> 3:12:27.560]  because every day they they take to do it more and more people are waking up
[3:12:27.560 --> 3:12:31.480]  and i'm very optimistic and although there's not going to be some enormous
[3:12:31.480 --> 3:12:34.920]  real big challenges uh to come uh but but
[3:12:34.920 --> 3:12:38.600]  i'm i'm getting more and more optimistic and you know
[3:12:38.600 --> 3:12:43.000]  we it's a phrase i use um from time to time
[3:12:43.000 --> 3:12:47.400]  life tends to give us our greatest gifts brilliantly disguised as our worst
[3:12:47.400 --> 3:12:50.920]  nightmares you know sometimes what appears to be our
[3:12:50.920 --> 3:12:54.360]  worst nightmare turns out to be our greatest gift like massive ridicule
[3:12:54.360 --> 3:12:58.760]  for me in the early 1990s right up to you know almost the year 2000 i went
[3:12:58.760 --> 3:13:03.240]  through incredible ridicule in britain but it set me free because it set me free
[3:13:03.240 --> 3:13:07.080]  of concern about what people thought of me which allowed me to open my mind and
[3:13:07.080 --> 3:13:11.320]  allow consciousness in and some of these challenges you know
[3:13:11.320 --> 3:13:14.680]  which we don't like i mean who does are actually going to
[3:13:14.680 --> 3:13:18.520]  um awake a lot of people up and set them free
[3:13:18.520 --> 3:13:22.120]  there's a line in a song uh which goes um
[3:13:22.120 --> 3:13:25.400]  freedoms just another word for nothing left to lose
[3:13:25.400 --> 3:13:29.240]  and you know when we think we've got something to lose that reptilian brain
[3:13:29.240 --> 3:13:32.360]  survival mechanism is is is controlling us oh my
[3:13:32.360 --> 3:13:35.000]  goodness yes anything i don't want to lose this anything
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:38.840]  but when you lose it you then you go well hold on a second what have i actually
[3:13:38.840 --> 3:13:42.520]  lost this is okay i can deal with this and actually life's nice
[3:13:42.520 --> 3:13:46.120]  and it's funny that people i talked to so many people who lived through the
[3:13:46.120 --> 3:13:50.200]  second world war in in britain who say life was much nicer during the war
[3:13:50.200 --> 3:13:53.320]  because people were nicer to each other and and all the rest of it they they
[3:13:53.320 --> 3:13:56.760]  never had much and they were helping each other because they never had much
[3:13:56.760 --> 3:13:59.960]  in ways that soon as the war was over every man for himself all that all that
[3:13:59.960 --> 3:14:04.040]  stopped and my goodness me as it as it stopped now and also made them enjoy
[3:14:04.040 --> 3:14:07.240]  things more because they had less uh
[3:14:07.240 --> 3:14:10.440]  they smelled the roses they smelled the roses because they thought they didn't
[3:14:10.440 --> 3:14:13.080]  know how long the roses were going to be there to be smelled
[3:14:13.080 --> 3:14:17.080]  and and you know there's so many challenges uh alex which and i've had
[3:14:17.080 --> 3:14:21.400]  some big ones in my life we all have when i look back i think i didn't like it
[3:14:21.400 --> 3:14:25.320]  at the time but i wouldn't change a thing because i am what i am not despite
[3:14:25.320 --> 3:14:29.640]  that but to a large extent because of it well there's that job if we see that
[3:14:29.640 --> 3:14:34.040]  if we if we if we experience these challenges from that perspective rather
[3:14:34.040 --> 3:14:39.160]  than oh my god reptilian brain then not only are we gonna um get through them
[3:14:39.160 --> 3:14:43.000]  with less pain and and all the rest of it we're actually going to think straight
[3:14:43.000 --> 3:14:46.600]  in a way that's going to allow us to get through them in a much more effective way
[3:14:46.600 --> 3:14:50.280]  absolutely and the point i was going to add is that so many people in these
[3:14:50.280 --> 3:14:54.840]  pyramidal power structures and i'd like you to speak to this
[3:14:54.840 --> 3:14:59.720]  they are just as imprisoned as lowly little minions totally of the system
[3:14:59.720 --> 3:15:03.720]  and more and more i'm talking to people to think of themselves as the elite
[3:15:03.720 --> 3:15:07.160]  and they're beginning to realize this is a prison
[3:15:07.160 --> 3:15:10.280]  they're beginning to realize they're drinking sodium fluoride their kids are
[3:15:10.280 --> 3:15:14.600]  drinking it they're beginning to realize that that that that that this system
[3:15:14.600 --> 3:15:18.600]  affects everybody and they're beginning to realize that the television and the
[3:15:18.600 --> 3:15:22.120]  culture and the dumbing down is taking their children from them
[3:15:22.120 --> 3:15:26.760]  and destroying their own destiny so i'd like you to speak to that and then i
[3:15:26.760 --> 3:15:32.200]  want to bring up rolling stone magazine that i just happened to see laying
[3:15:32.200 --> 3:15:37.480]  there on the commons table at the emis building where i was doing the sunday
[3:15:37.480 --> 3:15:41.160]  radio show syndicated show i want to break this down what rake herswell is
[3:15:41.160 --> 3:15:45.080]  saying and we've got our vision of the future liberty freedom
[3:15:45.080 --> 3:15:48.920]  you know dynamic human spirit and a new renaissance
[3:15:48.920 --> 3:15:52.920]  you know to the power of a trillion versus
[3:15:52.920 --> 3:15:57.560]  versus their renaissance of a very dark renaissance in their own words
[3:15:57.560 --> 3:16:00.680]  they just say that it's beautiful but clearly it's
[3:16:00.680 --> 3:16:04.840]  it's quite ugly but i mean can you speak to the point i just made
[3:16:04.840 --> 3:16:08.920]  yeah this is a point i i make as often as i can because
[3:16:08.920 --> 3:16:12.760]  we go back to the uh the the the sheet policing
[3:16:12.760 --> 3:16:16.600]  the herd the sheet policing themselves because
[3:16:16.600 --> 3:16:20.360]  when you're talking about people in full awareness
[3:16:20.360 --> 3:16:24.840]  of this agenda and in full support of advancing it
[3:16:24.840 --> 3:16:29.160]  you're talking about a dramatically few people compared with the global
[3:16:29.160 --> 3:16:32.200]  population you're certainly not looking at enough to
[3:16:32.200 --> 3:16:37.640]  administer the institutions of control um that that we see a cross global
[3:16:37.640 --> 3:16:41.640]  society so you need uh people in your target
[3:16:41.640 --> 3:16:45.720]  population to um do the administration for you this
[3:16:45.720 --> 3:16:49.400]  is why when you you look at the pyramid uh structure
[3:16:49.400 --> 3:16:54.680]  uh of these organizations and these uh secret societies whatever
[3:16:54.680 --> 3:16:58.280]  you're looking at the few at the top in full awareness of what it's all about
[3:16:58.280 --> 3:17:02.280]  and as you go further further down the pyramid you you each step down
[3:17:02.280 --> 3:17:05.720]  knows less and less and less about the big picture only their part in it
[3:17:05.720 --> 3:17:10.280]  and so they've got right across the system people in dark suits and
[3:17:10.280 --> 3:17:13.720]  and and they're like who are administering this system
[3:17:13.720 --> 3:17:18.360]  and are um uh welded to it in terms of their uh
[3:17:18.360 --> 3:17:22.680]  uh subordination to it all don't don't rock the boat all don't don't
[3:17:22.680 --> 3:17:26.760]  you don't step out of line don't say anything they get to dominate those
[3:17:26.760 --> 3:17:30.760]  under them and they get dominated from those above them it's a psychosystem
[3:17:30.760 --> 3:17:35.480]  yes it is and what we need to do is a very important area
[3:17:35.480 --> 3:17:41.880]  is to get those people to actually again look around them take a deep breath
[3:17:41.880 --> 3:17:45.720]  and just look at it again and by connecting dots
[3:17:45.720 --> 3:17:52.280]  um you can let people who are in those systems realize how their dot connects
[3:17:52.280 --> 3:17:55.880]  with everyone else's because stopping them realizing that is how the whole
[3:17:55.880 --> 3:18:00.920]  system works so people make their daily contribution to a control system not
[3:18:00.920 --> 3:18:04.840]  realizing that their dot is adding to other dots to make the control system
[3:18:04.840 --> 3:18:08.840]  and and it's it's so important that those people understand whether they're in
[3:18:08.840 --> 3:18:12.520]  uniform or whether they're in in in dark suit professions
[3:18:12.520 --> 3:18:17.320]  that their children are going to have to live in the world that they are
[3:18:17.320 --> 3:18:23.080]  helping fundamentally to introduce you know all these legislation that is even
[3:18:23.080 --> 3:18:28.120]  written and and administered around the world to build this police
[3:18:28.120 --> 3:18:32.760]  state he's done by people who are themselves and their children and
[3:18:32.760 --> 3:18:38.040]  grandchildren are going to be subjected to that uh police state that they're
[3:18:38.040 --> 3:18:41.480]  helping to build and talk about a fraud their own families
[3:18:41.480 --> 3:18:45.480]  you know and and they need to start stepping out of that pyramid because
[3:18:45.480 --> 3:18:50.440]  when they do and refusing to to uh uh play a part in it because
[3:18:50.440 --> 3:18:53.160]  when they do the pyramid collapses because they're holding it up
[3:18:53.160 --> 3:18:56.760]  just let me throw a point in here David exactly let me throw a point in i mean
[3:18:56.760 --> 3:19:00.360]  to talk about how it's all a facade all a matrix illusion look at the world
[3:19:00.360 --> 3:19:05.720]  banking system out of fiat currency uh with a handful of less than 15 families
[3:19:05.720 --> 3:19:09.800]  who rule the planet because they bought off governments to say that they
[3:19:09.800 --> 3:19:13.560]  issued the the backing of the money i mean it's all
[3:19:13.560 --> 3:19:17.640]  just a fraud and then out of that what they're doing right now economically
[3:19:17.640 --> 3:19:20.920]  trying to bankrupt things so we have to defend
[3:19:20.920 --> 3:19:23.880]  depend on the state and have to be under their control
[3:19:23.880 --> 3:19:27.880]  looks like a desperate gamble yeah we have to say we have to say
[3:19:27.880 --> 3:19:30.760]  no we're not building our own prison anymore and then
[3:19:30.760 --> 3:19:34.120]  something fantastic happens we stop building our own prison
[3:19:34.120 --> 3:19:37.480]  and the next thing is the prison isn't being built and there is no prison
[3:19:37.480 --> 3:19:41.800]  look how many people work for the banking system and administer it and make it
[3:19:41.800 --> 3:19:46.680]  happen compared with the number of people that own it it's fantastic
[3:19:46.680 --> 3:19:49.320]  David ike let's come back talk about solutions and at the bottom of the
[3:19:49.320 --> 3:19:53.800]  hour start taking phone calls i'm also going to get into this
[3:19:53.800 --> 3:19:57.400]  they say the elite are going to live forever in rolling stone oh i thought i
[3:19:57.400 --> 3:19:59.880]  heard that in endgame we'll break it down in

[3:24:14.600 --> 3:24:19.000]  all its competition commits genocide which we see ancient cultures doing to
[3:24:19.000 --> 3:24:23.080]  their neighbors over and over again if you kill everybody if you come in
[3:24:23.080 --> 3:24:26.920]  to the promised land or you're the Aztecs you're coming to a Mayan
[3:24:26.920 --> 3:24:30.440]  area and you kill everybody or you're the nazis
[3:24:30.440 --> 3:24:34.200]  you're going to go around the world and take over have an administrative system
[3:24:34.200 --> 3:24:38.840]  have carbon taxes the nazis propose similar taxes
[3:24:38.840 --> 3:24:42.520]  and then have one-child policies forced inoculations
[3:24:42.520 --> 3:24:47.480]  soft kill then you kill everybody except your people
[3:24:47.480 --> 3:24:52.120]  then you win that's the reptilian brain but of course then that idea continues
[3:24:52.120 --> 3:24:55.320]  and the nazis would have gone on forever basically killing each other
[3:24:55.320 --> 3:24:59.080]  just like the priest class were doing in israel whenever they didn't have some
[3:24:59.080 --> 3:25:02.600]  new enemy to fight they started pressing the tribes under them

[3:25:37.560 --> 3:25:40.760]  ray Kurzweil profit of the techno rapture he's made billions of dollars
[3:25:40.760 --> 3:25:47.720]  invented a bunch of computer systems by 2045 he really says 2020
[3:25:47.720 --> 3:25:51.000]  computers will surpass us in intelligence the universe itself will
[3:25:51.000 --> 3:25:55.160]  become conscious and humans will live forever
[3:25:55.160 --> 3:25:57.880]  but when you actually read what Kurzweil says and what the all the rest said
[3:25:57.880 --> 3:26:00.680]  they say the elite are going to kill off the majority of us
[3:26:00.680 --> 3:26:04.680]  they're going to merge with the silicon system that they call rational
[3:26:04.680 --> 3:26:08.680]  it's the reptilian brain logic they say it's logic that i kill all of you and
[3:26:08.680 --> 3:26:11.640]  then i win they say they revel in
[3:26:11.640 --> 3:26:16.040]  mathematic equations but really it's just cold-blooded wickedness
[3:26:16.040 --> 3:26:19.160]  they would say there is no such thing as wicked i am beyond good and evil i'm
[3:26:19.160 --> 3:26:23.320]  going to kill you now this article doesn't get into all of that it gets
[3:26:23.320 --> 3:26:26.840]  into some of it bill joys why the future doesn't need us does
[3:26:26.840 --> 3:26:30.280]  but it gets in all the things Kurzweil invented all the things he did molecular
[3:26:30.280 --> 3:26:33.800]  robots will spread through the tiniest recesses of all matter
[3:26:33.800 --> 3:26:38.200]  Kurzweil predicts turning rocks into trees and living computers
[3:26:38.200 --> 3:26:41.000]  we won't experience 100 years of progress the 21st century will be more
[3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:45.080]  like 20 000 years of progress and he just says oh you won't take
[3:26:45.080 --> 3:26:49.000]  brain chips it won't matter the nanotech will instantly take you over
[3:26:49.000 --> 3:26:53.960]  so they're saying resistance is futile you don't have a
[3:26:53.960 --> 3:26:58.200]  choice we are the final revolution and then they put in a liberal
[3:26:58.200 --> 3:27:03.000]  sicky feely packaging what say you to this because when i read the real
[3:27:03.000 --> 3:27:05.800]  globalist documents they say they're going to kill the majority of us
[3:27:05.800 --> 3:27:09.080]  because we don't deserve the life extension technology and that they can
[3:27:09.080 --> 3:27:13.080]  just be made to live to be 140 or so people that are like 70 now
[3:27:13.080 --> 3:27:18.440]  that then they'll have eternal lives as nanotech beings that will
[3:27:18.440 --> 3:27:23.720]  send their consciousness out of spores on the solar wind i'm not saying this
[3:27:23.720 --> 3:27:27.960]  they're saying it and they call us nuts david ike this is what the world
[3:27:27.960 --> 3:27:32.600]  elite believe this is their religion what is this
[3:27:32.600 --> 3:27:39.320]  well it's uh it's uh uh just a tenth amount to the the insanity that lies
[3:27:39.320 --> 3:27:43.080]  behind all that's happening see cleverness and
[3:27:43.080 --> 3:27:46.440]  wisdom are not the same thing and in fact cleverness without wisdom is the
[3:27:46.440 --> 3:27:51.080]  most destructive force on earth and they are on a mind level
[3:27:51.080 --> 3:27:54.120]  clever but they are not wise and that's why they're
[3:27:54.120 --> 3:27:57.800]  so destructive and devastatingly destructive in their
[3:27:57.800 --> 3:28:02.920]  in their potential to to to wreak havoc in even greater
[3:28:02.920 --> 3:28:07.000]  levels and amounts and they have up to this point they're basically insane
[3:28:07.000 --> 3:28:10.840]  they do not have the ability to connect through
[3:28:10.840 --> 3:28:14.840]  empathy through consciousness through any form of
[3:28:14.840 --> 3:28:18.120]  what we would call human connection and therefore
[3:28:18.120 --> 3:28:22.120]  you know they are and you know i know people have laughed and dismissed it in
[3:28:22.120 --> 3:28:25.480]  in the in the in the past and and good luck to them
[3:28:25.480 --> 3:28:29.240]  but there is a reason why these people understand fundamentally how to
[3:28:29.240 --> 3:28:32.280]  manipulate the reptilian brain of humans and that's because they are
[3:28:32.280 --> 3:28:38.360]  reptilian and uh they are the epitome of every trait
[3:28:38.360 --> 3:28:42.120]  that we talked about today um in the reptilian brain
[3:28:42.120 --> 3:28:47.240]  and one of one of them is that it is stupid and it does not learn from
[3:28:47.240 --> 3:28:53.160]  experience and it is it is um hell bent on taking this
[3:28:53.160 --> 3:28:58.040]  to to the sort of levels you're talking about but we and and they've been
[3:28:58.040 --> 3:29:01.080]  working towards this for a long time i mean i've been talking about this nano
[3:29:01.080 --> 3:29:05.000]  technology which are beyond microchips you see because the body
[3:29:05.000 --> 3:29:08.600]  is a biological computer you can access it through
[3:29:08.600 --> 3:29:12.520]  technological means this is what this whole thing about the
[3:29:12.520 --> 3:29:15.800]  computer brain interfaces where they're talking about putting a chip in the
[3:29:15.800 --> 3:29:18.840]  brain and then you can work your computer without using your hands
[3:29:18.840 --> 3:29:22.680]  um that's all because they're actually connecting two computers one more
[3:29:22.680 --> 3:29:26.600]  fantastic than the other yes but two computers and so this nano technology
[3:29:26.600 --> 3:29:30.360]  takes on a completely new light when you realize that because its ability to
[3:29:30.360 --> 3:29:33.400]  influence the body computer is fantastic and uh
[3:29:33.400 --> 3:29:36.760]  that's the real level that they're operating on the the nano level
[3:29:36.760 --> 3:29:40.360]  all right long segment coming up take phone calls 30 minutes left with david
[3:29:40.360 --> 3:29:42.840]  icke david icke.com and david tell me about your speaking

[3:36:02.600 --> 3:36:07.400]  David Ike briefly getting back into this Ray Kurzweil stuff I know you've read
[3:36:07.400 --> 3:36:10.520]  about the futurists the transhumanists and the eugenicists say
[3:36:10.520 --> 3:36:14.120]  and and and you're right they just say well we're scientific
[3:36:14.120 --> 3:36:18.040]  and we say that you have no right to the future and we're going to get rid of you
[3:36:18.040 --> 3:36:21.000]  but then if you talk about going after them physically they freak out and
[3:36:21.000 --> 3:36:24.760]  yell and scream and call SWAT teams on you so really it's just a
[3:36:24.760 --> 3:36:30.600]  cold-blooded as we say and again reptiles are cold-blooded the reptilian brain
[3:36:30.600 --> 3:36:36.280]  this is a cold-blooded idea and system and they sit there like our opinions
[3:36:36.280 --> 3:36:40.920]  don't even matter but that's a mind game we do have force of will we
[3:36:40.920 --> 3:36:45.480]  can stand up to them and they're scared of us having that purpose and deciding
[3:36:45.480 --> 3:36:48.840]  we're not listening to their propaganda we are warm-blooded
[3:36:48.840 --> 3:36:52.920]  we do have red blood and we're marching against their tyranny
[3:36:52.920 --> 3:36:57.400]  whatever the cost because humanity's future depends on it
[3:36:57.400 --> 3:37:02.120]  not being captured by a group of predatory homo sapiens sapiens
[3:37:02.120 --> 3:37:06.760]  who are acting like vampires
[3:37:06.760 --> 3:37:10.040]  yeah the thing is Alex that what they're terrified of
[3:37:10.040 --> 3:37:13.960]  more than anything else is people becoming conscious
[3:37:13.960 --> 3:37:17.560]  beyond mind and beyond the computer level of perception
[3:37:17.560 --> 3:37:21.320]  you can see in their own writings how they they use phrases like
[3:37:21.320 --> 3:37:26.600]  you know in in my words they they're terrified of mavericks mavericks are
[3:37:26.600 --> 3:37:29.080]  people that could could bring the whole thing down
[3:37:29.080 --> 3:37:32.760]  and what a mavericks mavericks are people who are not programmed who are not
[3:37:32.760 --> 3:37:36.520]  following secular ritual behavior and responses and reactions
[3:37:36.520 --> 3:37:40.680]  but are actually conscious enough to to act in ways that are different to the
[3:37:40.680 --> 3:37:45.880]  norm ways that you can't call and you know when it's so important
[3:37:45.880 --> 3:37:50.200]  that if you take the the body to be to be in the center of this
[3:37:50.200 --> 3:37:54.840]  on one side you've got the the illuminati families and I would say
[3:37:54.840 --> 3:37:59.320]  what is behind them trying to program the computer and try to
[3:37:59.320 --> 3:38:02.520]  destabilize the computer because all this stuff with fluoride and
[3:38:02.520 --> 3:38:07.560]  aspartame and and all these other electrochemical sources of disruption
[3:38:07.560 --> 3:38:11.160]  they're there to literally put viruses in the computer
[3:38:11.160 --> 3:38:14.760]  and when you put viruses in your laptop computer what happens it stops
[3:38:14.760 --> 3:38:17.880]  working properly it stops thinking straight it stops
[3:38:17.880 --> 3:38:22.200]  operating to full potential that's the idea but when consciousness enters the
[3:38:22.200 --> 3:38:26.520]  body it can overpower those programs and it
[3:38:26.520 --> 3:38:31.560]  can overpower those effects on the body I remember a story
[3:38:31.560 --> 3:38:35.560]  illustrates what I'm talking about when there was one of these uh these eastern
[3:38:35.560 --> 3:38:39.480]  mystic guys who was being used as part of an lsd
[3:38:39.480 --> 3:38:42.840]  experiment when they were they experimented in the 60s of lsd and
[3:38:42.840 --> 3:38:46.600]  some professor was over trying to see the
[3:38:46.600 --> 3:38:50.280]  effects on people and he gave this guy a dose of lsd
[3:38:50.280 --> 3:38:54.760]  which which should have blown his mind nothing happened the guy smiled at him
[3:38:54.760 --> 3:38:58.920]  he then doubled the dose eventually and the guy
[3:38:58.920 --> 3:39:03.320]  um still smiled at him and there was no effects of the lsd on this guy
[3:39:03.320 --> 3:39:07.400]  whatsoever why because the guy was conscious and through consciousness it
[3:39:07.400 --> 3:39:12.200]  overpowered the effect of the drug and that's just an illustration of how
[3:39:12.200 --> 3:39:16.200]  when we're conscious we can overpower all these attacks on the body
[3:39:16.200 --> 3:39:21.800]  and we can see through the uh the from a consciousness point of view blatant
[3:39:21.800 --> 3:39:26.760]  means of manipulation and that's what these guys are terrified of and I mean
[3:39:26.760 --> 3:39:30.280]  terrified because when humanity becomes conscious
[3:39:30.280 --> 3:39:34.760]  their game is over it's like we talked about last time in the
[3:39:34.760 --> 3:39:40.200]  the movie uh uh with the grasshoppers where it is said to be about the ants
[3:39:40.200 --> 3:39:44.120]  if they work out that there's uh you know
[3:39:44.120 --> 3:39:47.800]  loads of them and a few of us there goes our way of life
[3:39:47.800 --> 3:39:51.560]  when we become conscious there goes our way of life and that's why they work
[3:39:51.560 --> 3:39:55.800]  so constantly and incessantly through electrochemical means through
[3:39:55.800 --> 3:40:01.800]  programming through uh words and other means uh through religious uh belief
[3:40:01.800 --> 3:40:08.360]  uh extremism and uh and dogma to hold us in body consciousness and uh
[3:40:08.360 --> 3:40:11.720]  that's what they're terrified of of us breaking out of and we're doing it and
[3:40:11.720 --> 3:40:16.760]  that's why they're in a panic and david i mean just to simplify it
[3:40:16.760 --> 3:40:21.160]  by poisoning the higher brain you know the higher levels which is a
[3:40:21.160 --> 3:40:25.240]  physiological fact as people get poisoned and
[3:40:25.240 --> 3:40:30.360]  toxified more and more they revert to the lower animal
[3:40:30.360 --> 3:40:35.080]  reptile saltwater crocodile brain and just like a person once they've had
[3:40:35.080 --> 3:40:39.560]  Alzheimer's now people at 25 getting it from all the aluminum and mercury yeah
[3:40:39.560 --> 3:40:43.880]  everything reverts back to the level of a baby and the old man's throwing his
[3:40:43.880 --> 3:40:46.200]  feces against the wall i mean that's a horrible
[3:40:46.200 --> 3:40:50.040]  and uh parallel but that's they want to keep us in that
[3:40:50.040 --> 3:40:52.840]  and now you talk to the public you watch sitcoms
[3:40:52.840 --> 3:40:57.560]  and they talk slow and the public you see the public
[3:40:57.560 --> 3:41:01.320]  you'll see somebody who's upright and and and they'll kind of be at a store
[3:41:01.320 --> 3:41:04.520]  looking around and other people kind of freaked out i was having this experience
[3:41:04.520 --> 3:41:07.400]  last night in two stores i went to you could see people that were conscious
[3:41:07.400 --> 3:41:10.760]  they'd be like oh you're conscious and they were kind of all freaked out and
[3:41:10.760 --> 3:41:15.000]  then the rest of the people are like and i'm real and it seems like it's
[3:41:15.000 --> 3:41:18.600]  accelerating right now david it was kind of freaking me out
[3:41:18.600 --> 3:41:22.680]  because i wasn't on acid but it was almost like an acid trip
[3:41:22.680 --> 3:41:25.800]  watching and i was seeing other people that were noticing
[3:41:25.800 --> 3:41:29.480]  i mean do you see the point i'm making well the thing is there's a parting of
[3:41:29.480 --> 3:41:32.040]  the ways here i mean i'm seeing it more and more
[3:41:32.040 --> 3:41:35.640]  there are those that are becoming more and more programmed as the programming
[3:41:35.640 --> 3:41:39.160]  increases and there's those that are becoming less and less program as their
[3:41:39.160 --> 3:41:42.840]  program as their consciousness increases it's it's very much a parting of the
[3:41:42.840 --> 3:41:46.360]  ways there's two very much very different types of human
[3:41:46.360 --> 3:41:51.000]  being emerging which uh is becoming clearer and clearer by the week
[3:41:51.000 --> 3:41:55.000]  as as the people become conscious and people others get caught more and more
[3:41:55.000 --> 3:41:59.800]  in the programming and become less and less conscious and so the uh
[3:41:59.800 --> 3:42:03.480]  the difference between the two is going to be more and more obvious and
[3:42:03.480 --> 3:42:07.960]  demonstrable as as we go along this route see the thing about the the computer
[3:42:07.960 --> 3:42:11.480]  is it's vibrational on one level so you can get into it vibrationally
[3:42:11.480 --> 3:42:14.920]  it's uh electrochemical on another level so you can get into electrochemically
[3:42:14.920 --> 3:42:18.520]  it's electromagnetic on another level you get into electro magnet magnetically
[3:42:18.520 --> 3:42:22.840]  and and and you can get into it through words and and basically it's a war
[3:42:22.840 --> 3:42:26.280]  on the human body computer receiver transmission system and
[3:42:26.280 --> 3:42:30.280]  and it's much like a a stage hypnotist who is
[3:42:30.280 --> 3:42:33.800]  planting beliefs into the studios on the stage
[3:42:33.800 --> 3:42:38.280]  and a big leaf is is like a computer program it's like a piece of software
[3:42:38.280 --> 3:42:42.680]  because it it's a perception we believe that the
[3:42:42.680 --> 3:42:45.560]  federal reserve isn't private even though it is
[3:42:45.560 --> 3:42:48.600]  so people think it's the government and they and people will kill each other
[3:42:48.600 --> 3:42:52.280]  for a thousand dollars and they're just making it zeros and ones
[3:42:52.280 --> 3:42:56.360]  on a computer it's an illusion it's a spell yeah it's a spell yeah i mean one
[3:42:56.360 --> 3:43:01.080]  of the areas of my talk is breaking the spell and uh the um the the key
[3:43:01.080 --> 3:43:05.640]  point i'm i i want to make here is it's not so much the reality
[3:43:05.640 --> 3:43:11.160]  it's how we perceive reality that's the interface that they want to manipulate
[3:43:11.160 --> 3:43:14.040]  that i mean we live in an infinite reality
[3:43:14.040 --> 3:43:19.560]  but what they want to do is so program the receiver transmitter that reads
[3:43:19.560 --> 3:43:24.200]  reality um in this uh uh five cents world it's blind
[3:43:24.200 --> 3:43:28.040]  so that it reads reality to fit their agenda it's not reality
[3:43:28.040 --> 3:43:32.360]  it's the way we read it they want to manipulate and and basically you know
[3:43:32.360 --> 3:43:35.560]  you you can have a hypnotist on a stage and he'll get someone to um
[3:43:35.560 --> 3:43:38.920]  eat an apple but take a eat a potato but take an apple
[3:43:38.920 --> 3:43:43.160]  and all he's doing is putting a belief a program a software
[3:43:43.160 --> 3:43:47.240]  into the brain so that when the electrical signal from the tong
[3:43:47.240 --> 3:43:51.000]  uh with the uh information about the potato
[3:43:51.000 --> 3:43:55.560]  hits the brain it doesn't read it as a potato it reads it as an apple which is
[3:43:55.560 --> 3:43:59.240]  what it has been programmed to do it's it's it's um
[3:43:59.240 --> 3:44:04.120]  breaking into that um decoding system of the brain and they're doing that alex
[3:44:04.120 --> 3:44:07.720]  on multiple levels and that's what the new world order is
[3:44:07.720 --> 3:44:11.800]  is a mass hypnotist as you're saying and more and more i realize
[3:44:11.800 --> 3:44:15.320]  the cops the government people the new world order people
[3:44:15.320 --> 3:44:18.920]  uh you talk to a lot of them and and they are some of the blindest folks out
[3:44:18.920 --> 3:44:23.000]  there and and they're obsessive compulsive they're obsessed with
[3:44:23.000 --> 3:44:26.920]  you know like you said hierarchical systems and
[3:44:26.920 --> 3:44:30.440]  they are completely reduced down to almost nothing
[3:44:30.440 --> 3:44:36.120]  only getting that tiny bit of not not even small spectrum of reality false
[3:44:36.120 --> 3:44:41.000]  reality uh fed into them and then they arrange themselves in
[3:44:41.000 --> 3:44:46.280]  guilds they're the delusional crazy people because to me crazy denying what
[3:44:46.280 --> 3:44:50.360]  the full spectrum of reality is telling us we're crazy and they arrange
[3:44:50.360 --> 3:44:55.080]  themselves together above us that is a very very important point
[3:44:55.080 --> 3:44:59.800]  because um what happens is that these training programs
[3:44:59.800 --> 3:45:05.320]  for um people in uniform for government administrators and all the people that
[3:45:05.320 --> 3:45:10.920]  administer or law enforce the system these training programs are designed
[3:45:10.920 --> 3:45:15.400]  to program these people to read reality as the system
[3:45:15.400 --> 3:45:19.320]  once which is to read the systems version of reality there's an organization
[3:45:19.320 --> 3:45:23.080]  in this country i'm sure you'll know of a number in america
[3:45:23.080 --> 3:45:27.000]  it called common purpose common purpose started out
[3:45:27.000 --> 3:45:32.040]  uh with a person who um works from the office of the deputy prime minister
[3:45:32.040 --> 3:45:35.160]  under tony player it's the local non-governmental and the government
[3:45:35.160 --> 3:45:38.520]  gives them all the power and it really is the government to run every county
[3:45:38.520 --> 3:45:41.160]  every city yeah yeah what they're doing what what common
[3:45:41.160 --> 3:45:45.320]  purpose are doing and common purpose means common reality
[3:45:45.320 --> 3:45:49.000]  uh common purpose uh are going around uh and
[3:45:49.000 --> 3:45:55.480]  local government police um health services all these um institutions of
[3:45:55.480 --> 3:45:59.400]  the state are sending their people to these uh
[3:45:59.400 --> 3:46:03.400]  training programs at vast expense to the taxpayer
[3:46:03.400 --> 3:46:08.440]  to be programmed through classic mind manipulation techniques that they use
[3:46:08.440 --> 3:46:12.360]  and group uh uh uh intimidation techniques
[3:46:12.360 --> 3:46:18.760]  to get people to see reality in a common way that's what it's really about
[3:46:18.760 --> 3:46:23.480]  and then they go back um and and and they run their councils and the police
[3:46:23.480 --> 3:46:27.560]  and everything else in ways that to anyone who's conscious it's like you
[3:46:27.560 --> 3:46:30.200]  were talking about um um earlier in the supermarket
[3:46:30.200 --> 3:46:34.200]  anyone who's conscious is looking at this and going
[3:46:34.200 --> 3:46:39.080]  what are you what possibly is going on in your head that you can see this
[3:46:39.080 --> 3:46:42.920]  situation is justified but they do because that's the way they're
[3:46:42.920 --> 3:46:45.880]  reading reality they're all tomatons and that's what these
[3:46:45.880 --> 3:46:49.080]  training programs are there to do and these hypnotic techniques
[3:46:49.080 --> 3:46:52.840]  uh could much more advanced than the uc and the state shows
[3:46:52.840 --> 3:46:56.680]  uh what these people are trained to do well let me stand on that these people
[3:46:56.680 --> 3:46:59.240]  let me they and we're and we're gonna go to calls
[3:46:59.240 --> 3:47:03.400]  they have made it now where the police follow ridiculous orders
[3:47:03.400 --> 3:47:06.840]  and enforce it on the people to set the precedent
[3:47:06.840 --> 3:47:11.080]  where then the craziness of cops because an ambulance doesn't run
[3:47:11.080 --> 3:47:15.080]  I mean there's video of a cop car 100 miles an hour flies up on an ambulance
[3:47:15.080 --> 3:47:18.680]  the ambulance doesn't even know it's there it goes around the ambulance
[3:47:18.680 --> 3:47:22.920]  then pulls the ambulance over and beats the guy up and the cops then go to
[3:47:22.920 --> 3:47:26.440]  charge the guy they beat up on video who didn't touch them
[3:47:26.440 --> 3:47:30.200]  and then the cops think that's normal now that when they beat you up they
[3:47:30.200 --> 3:47:34.200]  charge you it's a cult like like like obriens torturing
[3:47:34.200 --> 3:47:37.160]  winston in 1984 and he's and he says we're the
[3:47:37.160 --> 3:47:42.520]  priest of power uh it's just raw reptilian exercise
[3:47:42.520 --> 3:47:46.200]  and then now the cps is grabbing everybody's kids for no reason and saying
[3:47:46.200 --> 3:47:49.800]  you can't raise your voice they are the cult and they're giving
[3:47:49.800 --> 3:47:53.640]  new download programs every week now to their minions
[3:47:53.640 --> 3:47:58.920]  in the sensitivity training to get crazier and crazier ramping up
[3:47:58.920 --> 3:48:04.680]  towards some horrible future some horrid mass culling telling us torturing
[3:48:04.680 --> 3:48:09.480]  people's good see the the point is here that we
[3:48:09.480 --> 3:48:12.840]  can talk about robots being made in the future and
[3:48:12.840 --> 3:48:17.800]  and all the rest of it but you take consciousness out of the human body
[3:48:17.800 --> 3:48:22.600]  and all you're left with is a biological computer in effect a robot
[3:48:22.600 --> 3:48:25.400]  and what they're doing is taking consciousness out
[3:48:25.400 --> 3:48:30.280]  um through their manipulation techniques and and leaving what is left
[3:48:30.280 --> 3:48:33.720]  which is just a computer system and what can you do with a computer system
[3:48:33.720 --> 3:48:39.080]  you can program it to do whatever you like so the whole process is
[3:48:39.080 --> 3:48:42.840]  make people unconscious and then program the reality of the computer that's
[3:48:42.840 --> 3:48:45.720]  left and that's why um you know anyone with
[3:48:45.720 --> 3:48:49.240]  consciousness looks at these people and goes this is just outrageous
[3:48:49.240 --> 3:48:53.960]  they can't see it any more than the computer in front of me would think it's
[3:48:53.960 --> 3:48:58.120]  outrageous and these to make it do something and the establishment test
[3:48:58.120 --> 3:49:01.320]  its biological androids they're testing the police to say
[3:49:01.320 --> 3:49:03.800]  okay beat up ambulance drivers for no reason
[3:49:03.800 --> 3:49:07.320]  okay taser somebody because they don't sign the ticket
[3:49:07.320 --> 3:49:11.720]  and then next they'll do something even more outrageous can someone fully lose
[3:49:11.720 --> 3:49:15.160]  consciousness uh i mean from the christian perspective
[3:49:15.160 --> 3:49:18.600]  that i see it that lose the soul the ultimate sin
[3:49:18.600 --> 3:49:22.200]  harden the heart goes so far that they become pure
[3:49:22.200 --> 3:49:26.920]  biological android vessels of the hive program system
[3:49:26.920 --> 3:49:31.320]  well yes because um you know we're all everything's one consciousness and you
[3:49:31.320 --> 3:49:35.320]  you can't uh lose a connection to to higher consciousness
[3:49:35.320 --> 3:49:40.040]  what you can lose is an awareness of it and then without that awareness you you
[3:49:40.040 --> 3:49:43.720]  you act in in in the sense of the awareness that you're left with which
[3:49:43.720 --> 3:49:47.240]  is a limited awareness that has a completely different
[3:49:47.240 --> 3:49:52.040]  uh perception of reality to what it would have if it if it was in its full
[3:49:52.040 --> 3:49:57.000]  uh uh level of uh awareness which is what i call consciousness so and so
[3:49:57.000 --> 3:50:01.720]  they're damned i mean well the thing that'd be like if there was a a a a
[3:50:01.720 --> 3:50:06.200]  dome city hypothetically two miles under my feet i don't know it's there
[3:50:06.200 --> 3:50:10.520]  therefore it doesn't exist yeah the thing is that in an ideal world
[3:50:10.520 --> 3:50:14.120]  you've got consciousness having experience through the physical body so
[3:50:14.120 --> 3:50:19.400]  you're in this water and you and and your your your um of it uh or not of it
[3:50:19.400 --> 3:50:25.080]  and the computer system and the mind the interface is is is fine
[3:50:25.080 --> 3:50:28.440]  it's the means through which like this computer in front of me allows me to
[3:50:28.440 --> 3:50:32.680]  um uh experience the collective reality we call the internet
[3:50:32.680 --> 3:50:38.840]  the key is when consciousness is is is kept out and what's left is the computer
[3:50:38.840 --> 3:50:42.520]  because then the computer is is deciding where you go on the internet and what
[3:50:42.520 --> 3:50:47.160]  you think of it and how you act on it not but not the person on the keyboard
[3:50:47.160 --> 3:50:51.880]  and that's what these people are incredible they would agree to go five ten
[3:50:51.880 --> 3:50:55.000]  minutes in in the overdrive we're gonna come back in the final segment
[3:50:55.000 --> 3:50:58.280]  and then in the overdrive will take the rest of calls as well just
[3:50:58.280 --> 3:51:01.720]  mind-blowing because as i research this i'm finding out he's right
[3:51:01.720 --> 3:51:06.120]  we are surrounded by harmful indoor air that can easily deliver many harmful
[3:51:06.120 --> 3:51:09.800]  toxins straight into our bodies take a deep breath
[3:51:09.800 --> 3:51:14.200]  can you actually feel the airborne influenza viruses mold bacteria and
[3:51:14.200 --> 3:51:17.800]  dangerous ozone entering your lungs have a glass of water
[3:51:17.800 --> 3:51:21.960]  can you taste the harmful chlorine fluoride lead pharmaceutical drugs and
[3:51:21.960 --> 3:51:25.800]  numerous other chemicals of course you can't the air that you breathe and the

[3:55:14.040 --> 3:55:18.680]  this is the this is the great crossroads that we're certainly at right
[3:55:18.680 --> 3:55:22.600]  now chris in florida you're on the air go ahead welcome
[3:55:22.600 --> 3:55:25.800]  hey alex hey david uh chris had a question
[3:55:25.800 --> 3:55:30.520]  um about the what we see a lot lately the elite are real obsessed and into the
[3:55:30.520 --> 3:55:34.760]  occult and they've kind of been commercializing it like with movies and
[3:55:34.760 --> 3:55:38.760]  with celebrities wearing like cabala bracelets you saw that for a while was a
[3:55:38.760 --> 3:55:43.800]  trend um they're big there are big rituals when
[3:55:43.800 --> 3:55:48.280]  like aspects to 911 and columbine and these types of things yes they may
[3:55:48.280 --> 3:55:51.640]  inline it and then and then it's revelation of the method because again
[3:55:51.640 --> 3:55:54.520]  they're engaging in mass programming at the art dipole
[3:55:54.520 --> 3:55:58.600]  reptilian brain david ike that's exactly what they're doing yeah and and
[3:55:58.600 --> 3:56:03.400]  other things too because again it's it's important to stress that
[3:56:03.400 --> 3:56:08.440]  these people understand reality uh to a far greater extent than they allow the
[3:56:08.440 --> 3:56:11.400]  people to you know that this is why they've
[3:56:11.400 --> 3:56:15.560]  destroyed ancient knowledge and destroyed uh ancient history and stuff
[3:56:15.560 --> 3:56:18.760]  like that as much as they can so they can replace it with their their fake
[3:56:18.760 --> 3:56:21.480]  history so we don't know um you know where all
[3:56:21.480 --> 3:56:24.520]  this has come from and it's very much more difficult to get a fix on where we
[3:56:24.520 --> 3:56:29.080]  are um and uh they understand reality and their
[3:56:29.080 --> 3:56:34.520]  rituals are designed to manipulate and uh um
[3:56:34.520 --> 3:56:38.920]  program reality that's why they do them and and people think of satanic rituals
[3:56:38.920 --> 3:56:42.840]  you know with people around a a slab at an altar and my goodness that they go
[3:56:42.840 --> 3:56:45.720]  on and some of the most famous people in the world take part in them
[3:56:45.720 --> 3:56:50.680]  but uh there are mass rituals too and something like a a war a second world
[3:56:50.680 --> 3:56:53.880]  war is a ritual uh at nine eleven is a ritual to them
[3:56:53.880 --> 3:56:57.880]  and they're doing it systematically and you know on one level
[3:56:57.880 --> 3:57:01.320]  uh this reality um and then even mainstream science is understanding
[3:57:01.320 --> 3:57:04.760]  this now is digital another reason why i think it's
[3:57:04.760 --> 3:57:08.120]  highly significant this move over to digital television personally
[3:57:08.120 --> 3:57:12.280]  and it's numbers it's mathematics and and so all this numerology and all these
[3:57:12.280 --> 3:57:17.160]  uh uh uh cult ritual codes that they use where they do things on a certain day
[3:57:17.160 --> 3:57:21.320]  and that you see thirty threes and nine elevens these are all coming from a
[3:57:21.320 --> 3:57:24.520]  level of knowledge of how you can manipulate numbers and let me throw
[3:57:24.520 --> 3:57:27.000]  this out we got a break here and start the next
[3:57:27.000 --> 3:57:29.560]  hour so let's get tim to call in on the new line
[3:57:29.560 --> 3:57:33.240]  there tim and ohio but let me throw this out the aztecs did it why do separate
[3:57:33.240 --> 3:57:36.520]  human cultures that don't even know each other do the same things this is a
[3:57:36.520 --> 3:57:40.120]  system of control the romans wrote that they use the gladiatorial
[3:57:40.120 --> 3:57:42.920]  events where you would go like it was entertainment
[3:57:42.920 --> 3:57:47.000]  and watch your neighbor have his guts torn out so a month later when you were
[3:57:47.000 --> 3:57:50.600]  getting your guts torn out your neighbor wouldn't stand up for you against
[3:57:50.600 --> 3:57:53.800]  the state it's making a sport like these cop shows
[3:57:53.800 --> 3:57:58.120]  out of seeing the cops hunt us down we're dehumanizing ourselves
[3:57:58.120 --> 3:58:02.360]  so the ritual has a reason there's a method to the madness is that what you're
[3:58:02.360 --> 3:58:05.880]  saying david oh absolutely i mean they are crazy
[3:58:05.880 --> 3:58:10.440]  but they're very clever in the way that they use the knowledge they have
[3:58:10.440 --> 3:58:14.600]  crazy like a fox info wars dot com prison planet dot com

[4:00:45.640 --> 4:00:49.800]  austin i hear me yes i can't hear you're on the air with david ike go ahead
[4:00:49.800 --> 4:00:53.320]  yeah thank you both alex you're doing an amazing job i really appreciate what
[4:00:53.320 --> 4:00:56.360]  you're doing david that's great to hear you on the show
[4:00:56.360 --> 4:01:00.600]  really quick thing about chemtrails uh we're seeing tons of them across
[4:01:00.600 --> 4:01:03.720]  america right now and i went and did my research
[4:01:03.720 --> 4:01:09.000]  two questions one how you know how can we uh make it more public uh because the
[4:01:09.000 --> 4:01:12.200]  media has ignored all my requests to take a look at it
[4:01:12.200 --> 4:01:15.800]  and two when i researched it and i dug into the patent
[4:01:15.800 --> 4:01:20.200]  uh huge patent they were gonna use thorium oxide and aluminum oxide and
[4:01:20.200 --> 4:01:22.840]  right now they're actually using barium oxide
[4:01:22.840 --> 4:01:25.720]  now if they really wanted to wipe us out quickly
[4:01:25.720 --> 4:01:29.400]  thorium oxide will cause men to go sterile
[4:01:29.400 --> 4:01:33.320]  but they chose barium oxide so we stop you say they chose that's only one
[4:01:33.320 --> 4:01:37.240]  program and i've looked at that as well there's thousands of different programs
[4:01:37.240 --> 4:01:41.560]  going on they're spraying a whole bunch of different types of metals and oxides
[4:01:41.560 --> 4:01:46.120]  in the atmosphere david ike the chemtrails and attempted to poisonous
[4:01:46.120 --> 4:01:50.200]  well i was uh earlier this year uh in um
[4:01:50.200 --> 4:01:56.280]  arizona and um i was sitting in a house uh every morning watching the sky i think
[4:01:56.280 --> 4:02:00.200]  from a it was coming up from an ab an arizona air base the sky being
[4:02:00.200 --> 4:02:05.320]  criss-crossed every day until the the blue sky disappeared and it was just
[4:02:05.320 --> 4:02:09.240]  uh all the chemtrails joined together to make a cloudy day it was
[4:02:09.240 --> 4:02:11.960]  extraordinary it happened day after day after day after day
[4:02:11.960 --> 4:02:17.000]  i tell you what my information is um uh and that's that uh among all the other
[4:02:17.000 --> 4:02:20.760]  stuff that is uh identifiable in these chemtrails
[4:02:20.760 --> 4:02:23.880]  what is what is also in there is nanotechnology
[4:02:23.880 --> 4:02:27.560]  it's interesting what you mentioned earlier in the show um alex and i think
[4:02:27.560 --> 4:02:32.440]  this is one way that they're putting um uh nanotechnology into the atmosphere
[4:02:32.440 --> 4:02:36.760]  i feel myself that um the chemtrails and the harp
[4:02:36.760 --> 4:02:41.800]  uh system is are completely connected i mean i think there's multi reasons why
[4:02:41.800 --> 4:02:45.320]  the chemtrails are there and there's multi things in them to have multi effects
[4:02:45.320 --> 4:02:48.680]  but i think what they're trying to do is create a
[4:02:48.680 --> 4:02:53.800]  sub-reality around the earth uh a simple thing how do you affect all the fish
[4:02:53.800 --> 4:02:59.160]  you affect the sea and um it's it the radio waves uh bouncing off the
[4:02:59.160 --> 4:03:03.320]  ionosphere from harp and the way they're changing the lower atmosphere i think
[4:03:03.320 --> 4:03:07.000]  are fundamentally connected i've not connected everything there but i'm
[4:03:07.000 --> 4:03:12.120]  sure that that's where the truth lies and it's to do with um creating a
[4:03:12.120 --> 4:03:17.160]  sub-reality in which they can feed in these uh thought forms and thought
[4:03:17.160 --> 4:03:22.920]  uh messages through the the radio waves uh on the frequency of the human body
[4:03:22.920 --> 4:03:26.360]  computer uh receive a transmission uh frequencies
[4:03:26.360 --> 4:03:29.800]  so they're feeding realities into us that way as well
[4:03:29.800 --> 4:03:33.960]  well we know that i mean i remember you talking about this over a decade ago
[4:03:33.960 --> 4:03:37.640]  seeing government documents at battens but i saw the baltimore sun like seven
[4:03:37.640 --> 4:03:41.400]  years ago saying oh darpa's gonna put in us cities
[4:03:41.400 --> 4:03:45.640]  towers with different wavelengths they found to calm people
[4:03:45.640 --> 4:03:50.200]  if there's ever an emergency i mean they are admitting they're doing this this
[4:03:50.200 --> 4:03:54.520]  is not our opinion yeah and you know in they live where
[4:03:54.520 --> 4:03:58.360]  uh at the end of the movie they find that there's a transmission from the top of
[4:03:58.360 --> 4:04:02.680]  the tv tower which is me making uh it impossible for the public to
[4:04:02.680 --> 4:04:08.040]  see um the real controllers i think that that that is also massively based on
[4:04:08.040 --> 4:04:12.600]  truth um because um the the body computer is as a
[4:04:12.600 --> 4:04:16.840]  receiver transmit a frequency if they can find technology of course they have
[4:04:16.840 --> 4:04:20.600]  which can broadcast on that frequency they're actually feeding information
[4:04:20.600 --> 4:04:24.120]  into the human mind and of course what do people think they they think it's
[4:04:24.120 --> 4:04:26.920]  their thoughts and also it can shut the human mind
[4:04:26.920 --> 4:04:30.440]  down so it's not seeing certain frequencies on which certain things
[4:04:30.440 --> 4:04:33.960]  are happening so that they're going on and we can't even see them just as
[4:04:33.960 --> 4:04:37.560]  uh they live kind of symbolized well david i want to take a few final calls
[4:04:37.560 --> 4:04:40.120]  and let you go we've taken enough of your time but
[4:04:40.120 --> 4:04:45.560]  why did you wake up why did i wake up why does some people wake up
[4:04:45.560 --> 4:04:50.200]  and other people don't well i think that uh it's
[4:04:50.200 --> 4:04:55.160]  literally the depth of programming you know if you if you um are surrounded by
[4:04:55.160 --> 4:04:58.760]  six foot of concrete it's much more difficult to perceive what's
[4:04:58.760 --> 4:05:01.720]  being what's outside you know if you if you've got an
[4:05:01.720 --> 4:05:05.800]  inch of concrete then you might hear something and uh and what's happening
[4:05:05.800 --> 4:05:12.520]  is that uh the people are waking up um and and uh in accordance to how asleep
[4:05:12.520 --> 4:05:16.360]  they were and what's happening now is people are waking up who
[4:05:16.360 --> 4:05:20.760]  further back down the line were very asleep and that's very very encouraging
[4:05:20.760 --> 4:05:23.800]  what about genetics you're always saying that the elites are obsessive
[4:05:23.800 --> 4:05:26.280]  genetics we know they are because they want to
[4:05:26.280 --> 4:05:30.840]  focus the genetics for the type of us predatory system they're into
[4:05:30.840 --> 4:05:34.600]  is it also genetics to be awake to this well well
[4:05:34.600 --> 4:05:38.600]  well consciousness can overpower the computer what what will overpower the
[4:05:38.600 --> 4:05:40.680]  reality of the computer what they're trying to do
[4:05:40.680 --> 4:05:45.400]  is put people so powerfully into computer reality through genetic manipulation
[4:05:45.400 --> 4:05:49.240]  uh and of course genetically modified food is only there for one reason it's
[4:05:49.240 --> 4:05:52.920]  genetic modify us oh they admit it kills the animals they feed it to
[4:05:52.920 --> 4:05:56.680]  yeah so so that so that the the body computer becomes a less and less
[4:05:56.680 --> 4:06:00.440]  effective receiver transmitter of of higher levels of information
[4:06:00.440 --> 4:06:03.480]  i don't know how long we got left but let me say this you got as much time as
[4:06:03.480 --> 4:06:07.000]  you want but i don't want to keep your past i just want to say this one thing
[4:06:07.000 --> 4:06:10.600]  because you brought up this thing about genetics this is what i feel
[4:06:10.600 --> 4:06:14.120]  you know i i've talked about this reptilian stuff and and and people
[4:06:14.120 --> 4:06:17.320]  kind of immediately kind of dismiss it because it's so different to their
[4:06:17.320 --> 4:06:20.600]  reality you look at some of the things in the
[4:06:20.600 --> 4:06:24.520]  bible you look at endless accounts in other
[4:06:24.520 --> 4:06:27.400]  ancient writings and you'll see this thing coming up
[4:06:27.400 --> 4:06:30.520]  for me i mean just do people think that the
[4:06:30.520 --> 4:06:34.200]  uh the snake in the in the garden of Eden with adam and eve which was all
[4:06:34.200 --> 4:06:37.400]  about genetics and the changing of humanity and all the rest of it
[4:06:37.400 --> 4:06:42.280]  uh and leaving the paradise um do um do they think it was literally a snake
[4:06:42.280 --> 4:06:47.240]  um and that story can be found uh it it in the same basic form all over the
[4:06:47.240 --> 4:06:51.080]  world he had legs and it says yes exactly but the
[4:06:51.080 --> 4:06:56.120]  jewish but the name for that uh the snake it actually refers to a
[4:06:56.120 --> 4:07:00.600]  humanoid being now for me that whole adam and eve
[4:07:00.600 --> 4:07:04.200]  kind of symbolism which you find around the world where it talks about these
[4:07:04.200 --> 4:07:08.680]  reptilian gods manipulating human genetics for me what they've done and
[4:07:08.680 --> 4:07:12.200]  there's increasing hard genetic evidence for this
[4:07:12.200 --> 4:07:16.360]  is they spliced the uh the the genes around and the dna around
[4:07:16.360 --> 4:07:21.880]  so that we stopped um perceiving decoding the frequency on which these
[4:07:21.880 --> 4:07:24.280]  people live because if you look at ancient accounts
[4:07:24.280 --> 4:07:27.720]  they often they talk about the gods living amongst them
[4:07:27.720 --> 4:07:31.720]  well where the hell are these gods i tell you what i feel and also they talk
[4:07:31.720 --> 4:07:35.160]  about people living uh incredible long lives and
[4:07:35.160 --> 4:07:38.200]  and incredible things that they could see that we think oh that must be
[4:07:38.200 --> 4:07:41.640]  fantasy because we can't see it i would say very strongly my
[4:07:41.640 --> 4:07:45.480]  research is moving so fast in this direction that the human
[4:07:45.480 --> 4:07:50.280]  form has been genetically manipulated and we we used to have far more strands
[4:07:50.280 --> 4:07:53.480]  of dna than we do now and it's all relates to this junk dna that they
[4:07:53.480 --> 4:07:56.600]  say they don't know what it does well i tell you what it does it connects us to
[4:07:56.600 --> 4:07:59.880]  all those um uh frequency areas we could decode at
[4:07:59.880 --> 4:08:03.800]  one point that we can't decode now what we call dark energy dark mass
[4:08:03.800 --> 4:08:08.200]  is just a continuation of of the reality that we have
[4:08:08.200 --> 4:08:11.880]  because of the manipulation of the receiver transmitter decoder the body
[4:08:11.880 --> 4:08:16.040]  we're not accessing the range of that reality that we used to
[4:08:16.040 --> 4:08:19.400]  well by the way david this is not just your opinion as you know
[4:08:19.400 --> 4:08:23.800]  major you know scientific institutions governments
[4:08:23.800 --> 4:08:27.560]  had always said it was junk dna but now they're noticing that
[4:08:27.560 --> 4:08:30.920]  even if you believe in evolution on a different evolutionary
[4:08:30.920 --> 4:08:35.960]  curve humans have in their dna copies of all these other life forms
[4:08:35.960 --> 4:08:40.040]  that aren't in our supposed evolutionary development
[4:08:40.040 --> 4:08:44.120]  with the way that you know they've put out evolution and all the
[4:08:44.120 --> 4:08:48.920]  disinformation packaged on that and top scientists who were atheist
[4:08:48.920 --> 4:08:53.560]  are now saying i don't know what made it but this stuff
[4:08:53.560 --> 4:08:58.280]  is engineered yeah well exactly and and you know um
[4:08:58.280 --> 4:09:03.000]  the the human condition can be uh brilliantly symbolized by what's happening
[4:09:03.000 --> 4:09:06.760]  in china we have a collective reality called the internet
[4:09:06.760 --> 4:09:11.640]  uh which is very very uh in in a much less away of course very symbolic of
[4:09:11.640 --> 4:09:14.840]  the the reality we're actually experiencing the matrix
[4:09:14.840 --> 4:09:17.800]  what they do in china the authorities because they don't want the people who
[4:09:17.800 --> 4:09:20.760]  have access to information that could wake them up and get them to see the
[4:09:20.760 --> 4:09:24.520]  situation is their firewalling off computers of course
[4:09:24.520 --> 4:09:29.320]  so that people in china can only access a much smaller part of the internet
[4:09:29.320 --> 4:09:32.920]  than the rest of the population but that didn't work hold on that didn't work so
[4:09:32.920 --> 4:09:35.080]  now they're going to by law make all new computers
[4:09:35.080 --> 4:09:38.920]  have a self regulator built into it that's the drugs that's the chemicals
[4:09:38.920 --> 4:09:42.680]  that's the programming in the computer itself not just the network
[4:09:42.680 --> 4:09:46.120]  yeah and what what initially happened i would suggest
[4:09:46.120 --> 4:09:52.760]  is that those body computers were programmed to not receive
[4:09:52.760 --> 4:09:57.640]  and therefore decode and experience the range of frequencies we could before
[4:09:57.640 --> 4:10:01.400]  which scientists are calling dark mass dark energy in this universe
[4:10:01.400 --> 4:10:05.400]  and so we're actually and look at it the visible light the only
[4:10:05.400 --> 4:10:09.240]  uh frequency range that we can perceive is
[4:10:09.240 --> 4:10:14.920]  ludicrously tiny uh why because it's been uh the body computer has been made
[4:10:14.920 --> 4:10:21.240]  to only access that frequency and uh that's what's happened and
[4:10:21.240 --> 4:10:25.880]  that's why we can't see the gods now that operate just outside of visible
[4:10:25.880 --> 4:10:28.680]  light as as the ancient accounts talked about
[4:10:28.680 --> 4:10:33.080]  in the in uh eons ago amazing we promised to go to these calls we're
[4:10:33.080 --> 4:10:35.480]  going to end the show in just a few minutes here quickly
[4:10:35.480 --> 4:10:38.920]  uh i've just got a new list here uh let's talk to leo
[4:10:38.920 --> 4:10:43.640]  leo you're on the air with david i go ahead hi this is leo from our tourists
[4:10:43.640 --> 4:10:47.000]  okay let's not screw around go ahead and ask your question david iker i'm gonna
[4:10:47.000 --> 4:10:50.680]  move on okay um i think what we should start
[4:10:50.680 --> 4:10:55.560]  uh letting everybody know about hitler's brown shirts being
[4:10:55.560 --> 4:10:59.000]  done in on the night of the long knives because that's
[4:10:59.000 --> 4:11:02.360]  how we get the police to understand that they're disposable
[4:11:02.360 --> 4:11:06.600]  and as far as calling people sheep with an insult to sheep
[4:11:06.600 --> 4:11:10.600]  because sheep are way too smart to watch television
[4:11:10.600 --> 4:11:14.040]  and uh we should call them as people because they're sleepwalking through
[4:11:14.040 --> 4:11:17.240]  life i hear you leo i appreciate your call
[4:11:17.240 --> 4:11:21.000]  yes uh the elites why do elites always terminate
[4:11:21.000 --> 4:11:24.040]  the group that helped them bring in the tyranny
[4:11:24.040 --> 4:11:27.640]  uh because uh they don't want them either i mean you know this is the thing
[4:11:27.640 --> 4:11:33.320]  about elites um they are as contemptuous in fact even more so
[4:11:33.320 --> 4:11:37.880]  of those that um blindly um uh help them
[4:11:37.880 --> 4:11:41.240]  bring in their tyrannies as they are the the general population that they
[4:11:41.240 --> 4:11:44.280]  tyrannized they've got total contempt you see
[4:11:44.280 --> 4:11:49.240]  these guys see humans in terms of the way so many humans see cattle
[4:11:49.240 --> 4:11:55.400]  and um you know they use the cattle to help them control the and
[4:11:55.400 --> 4:11:58.760]  tyrannize the rest of the cattle but they're still cattle
[4:11:58.760 --> 4:12:02.680]  they might have a fancy title yeah they might be head of this organization
[4:12:02.680 --> 4:12:06.600]  or but but to the elite of the elite they're still exactly and therefore
[4:12:06.600 --> 4:12:10.760]  disposable folks do you respect a cow more or a sheep or do you respect a
[4:12:10.760 --> 4:12:14.520]  grizzly bear or a wolf do you respect a killer whale
[4:12:14.520 --> 4:12:18.600]  more than you respect a jellyfish you see the elite respect
[4:12:18.600 --> 4:12:22.200]  people that fight them and resist them and know what they are they think of
[4:12:22.200 --> 4:12:25.240]  and i've had a you know globalist tell me that a few final calls got to let
[4:12:25.240 --> 4:12:28.840]  david go in here just a minute this is just amazing information
[4:12:28.840 --> 4:12:34.760]  uh let's talk to uh up next robert in kentucky or on the air go ahead
[4:12:34.760 --> 4:12:38.520]  oh great uh alex david um big fan of both yours
[4:12:38.520 --> 4:12:42.520]  an honor to talk to you uh i just wanted to know david from your
[4:12:42.520 --> 4:12:46.200]  perspective i'm glad you brought up the red gillian
[4:12:46.200 --> 4:12:51.000]  uh last week the u.s military cut off all information
[4:12:51.000 --> 4:12:55.640]  on incoming foreign bodies yes that was in the associated press in nasa
[4:12:55.640 --> 4:12:59.000]  all meteor storms you know they have them every year
[4:12:59.000 --> 4:13:03.720]  all everything's classified coming into the atmosphere now and all the rocks
[4:13:03.720 --> 4:13:06.200]  that come into the planet that they put on the news
[4:13:06.200 --> 4:13:10.280]  now national security david i know you saw that what are you
[4:13:10.280 --> 4:13:15.400]  sorry caller go ahead uh do you think that what what is your perspective on
[4:13:15.400 --> 4:13:20.680]  that playing into uh the return of the anarchy the the gods uh
[4:13:20.680 --> 4:13:25.240]  uh like i said i'll take the the answer or the globalist gonna stage a fake
[4:13:25.240 --> 4:13:29.000]  bluebeam go ahead thank you caller yeah well any of these things uh are
[4:13:29.000 --> 4:13:33.960]  possible i mean the the thing is that we are not the only
[4:13:33.960 --> 4:13:37.640]  life species in this universe but you know people
[4:13:37.640 --> 4:13:42.440]  um uh see visible light is the universe and like i say
[4:13:42.440 --> 4:13:46.440]  the universe is visible light plus all the dark matter which is the fast
[4:13:46.440 --> 4:13:50.520]  over and and math the vast majority of this universe
[4:13:50.520 --> 4:13:54.600]  we cannot decode and it's very badly named
[4:13:54.600 --> 4:13:58.920]  dark matter or dark energy because it gives the perception of being like
[4:13:58.920 --> 4:14:02.600]  somewhere with a light off it's not like that they call it dark because they
[4:14:02.600 --> 4:14:05.080]  can't see it and they can't see it because they're in bodies that can't
[4:14:05.080 --> 4:14:09.160]  decode it and uh a lot of these so-called um um
[4:14:09.160 --> 4:14:12.920]  aliens or extraterrestrial forms they actually come
[4:14:12.920 --> 4:14:18.040]  into visible light from the dark energy areas of the universe because they they
[4:14:18.040 --> 4:14:23.320]  can move frequencies and so um they can appear and disappear this is when
[4:14:23.320 --> 4:14:26.600]  people see see a UFO or some entity appear and disappear
[4:14:26.600 --> 4:14:30.520]  it's left the frequency of visible light so they can't decode it so to their
[4:14:30.520 --> 4:14:33.240]  perception it appears and disappears it doesn't
[4:14:33.240 --> 4:14:36.920]  it just it just moves into another now that we've gotten off in this realm we
[4:14:36.920 --> 4:14:39.880]  are on a planet the middle of the universe with billions of
[4:14:39.880 --> 4:14:43.640]  galaxies around us and caller i appreciate your call in closing david
[4:14:43.640 --> 4:14:47.000]  is there anybody going to come help us from the evil reptoid rulers i mean
[4:14:47.000 --> 4:14:50.280]  anybody going to save us or i guess that's up to us to do i don't i don't i
[4:14:50.280 --> 4:14:54.680]  don't think we need uh saving i i think the the means is already there it's a
[4:14:54.680 --> 4:14:58.600]  call becoming conscious and you see there's a reason why these guys are
[4:14:58.600 --> 4:15:01.400]  terrified of us becoming conscious and they work
[4:15:01.400 --> 4:15:05.080]  so desperately hard more so than ever before because they have to
[4:15:05.080 --> 4:15:09.640]  uh to keep us um in asleep because when when we wake up
[4:15:09.640 --> 4:15:13.080]  it's over for them and they know that i don't fully know the reason but this
[4:15:13.080 --> 4:15:17.320]  there's a reason they're terrified of us because of powers that the humans have
[4:15:17.320 --> 4:15:22.200]  that they do not have and and certainly when you are in uh at the
[4:15:22.200 --> 4:15:28.440]  depth uh of uh well i don't like using the word evil but the depth of imbalance
[4:15:28.440 --> 4:15:34.040]  and that they're in uh and sickness they cannot even begin to access
[4:15:34.040 --> 4:15:38.520]  consciousness they're so far away from it vibrationally because of the density
[4:15:38.520 --> 4:15:43.560]  their state of mind puts them in well david since you brought up uh the
[4:15:43.560 --> 4:15:48.280]  garden of eden and and and you know the issue here
[4:15:48.280 --> 4:15:53.800]  is we're made in the image of god are are i mean if you really interpret the
[4:15:53.800 --> 4:15:58.600]  bible that way are we a copy or or some manifestation of something else that's
[4:15:58.600 --> 4:16:03.480]  on other planets well i i i you see i think um
[4:16:03.480 --> 4:16:06.840]  that this whole um universe this whole reality this
[4:16:06.840 --> 4:16:12.120]  this whole infinite awareness is just so
[4:16:12.120 --> 4:16:15.480]  extraordinary compared with what we've been
[4:16:15.480 --> 4:16:21.400]  led to believe it through our lives you see you know even religions uh and and
[4:16:21.400 --> 4:16:24.920]  all these different ways of seeing a god in life
[4:16:24.920 --> 4:16:28.200]  we've got to remember that these have all developed
[4:16:28.200 --> 4:16:32.680]  within the limitations of human perception and that the perception of
[4:16:32.680 --> 4:16:36.840]  the of the the body computer and within this very narrow band we call
[4:16:36.840 --> 4:16:40.760]  visible light you know when we um uh expand our
[4:16:40.760 --> 4:16:44.520]  consciousness um out of that then and you've
[4:16:44.520 --> 4:16:47.640]  be hinted at it a few times the things you've said in the show
[4:16:47.640 --> 4:16:52.760]  you start to see the full incredible magnitude of what we're part of not
[4:16:52.760 --> 4:16:56.520]  just what we're part of but what we are and it's
[4:16:56.520 --> 4:16:59.480]  it's preventing us from that realization that
[4:16:59.480 --> 4:17:03.240]  self-realization that we are infinite consciousness
[4:17:03.240 --> 4:17:07.080]  that um they work so hard to to do because if they didn't
[4:17:07.080 --> 4:17:10.440]  and they weren't successful at doing it then what they do would be impossible
[4:17:10.440 --> 4:17:13.720]  well it's like bill hicks said then you figure out that it's just a ride
