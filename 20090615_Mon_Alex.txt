[00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:06.307]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.307 --> 00:00:08.088]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.088 --> 00:00:09.849]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:11.429]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.990]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.172]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.172 --> 00:00:22.035]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:29.098]  We have a very important radio show lined up for you today.
[00:00:29.098 --> 00:00:33.241]  Massive issues of great import.
[00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:33.801]  Coming up...
[00:00:36.704 --> 00:00:44.468]  David Icke is going to be on with us in the third and fourth hour for two full hours today to talk about a host of issues.
[00:00:44.468 --> 00:00:51.171]  Always interesting to get his perspective and his take on the world through his rose-colored darkly.
[00:00:51.171 --> 00:01:02.077]  We all wear one, so we all have different perspectives as our soul stares out through our eyes into the wider universe.
[00:01:02.077 --> 00:01:05.679]  No man is an island to himself, though we feel like it sometimes.
[00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:17.637]  Sam LaBriere is going to be joining us with some huge breaking news on that Bilderberg steering group meeting they had for four days last week that ended on Friday.
[00:01:17.637 --> 00:01:20.700]  He'll be popping in for 30 minutes in the next hour.
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:30.789]  A lot of things have been crystallizing for me.
[00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.471]  Or my level of knowledge has been hitting jump points.
[00:01:36.758 --> 00:01:41.660]  I tend to always gradually learn more about how the world works and how the globalists operate.
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:50.283]  And I'm always having basic realizations about their program, their paradigm, the way they carry out their operations.
[00:01:50.283 --> 00:02:02.127]  But just like with development of technologies or development of the species, or earthquakes with tectonic developments, things tend to happen in big jumps.
[00:02:02.127 --> 00:02:05.348]  And I have jump points all the time, but I had a big one last night.
[00:02:06.607 --> 00:02:07.748]  Almost knocked me over.
[00:02:07.748 --> 00:02:23.701]  And when something's fresh and new to you, you know, there's so many possibilities and so many fractal factors that enter into it, it's almost indescribable.
[00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:29.726]  And I was scrabbling around in the house looking for my little voice recorder so I could do an audio blog and couldn't find it.
[00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:53.767]  And then always in the morning, there's the day's distractions and office business and other things that seem to cloud the pronunciation, the articulation of the deeper truths.
[00:02:53.767 --> 00:02:59.689]  But so much of what I'm going to talk about today, we've already stated in so many ways here, it's just that it really hit me last night.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.541]  Like a ton of bricks that the public really is being dumbed down.
[00:03:06.541 --> 00:03:24.027]  The public really is having the English language and other major world languages reduced in the vocabulary size and in the speed of speech and that large portions of the population are basically mentally retarded now.
[00:03:24.027 --> 00:03:27.088]  Both chemically but also culturally.
[00:03:27.088 --> 00:03:30.729]  And that it's a feedback loop and this race to the bottom, this race
[00:03:35.396 --> 00:03:48.946]  Away from Renaissance to a type of bleeding, squat, ogre-like, grunting creatures.
[00:03:48.946 --> 00:04:03.576]  I saw a video clip up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com called Corporate Media Cyberbullying Propaganda from a television program called Yo Teach.
[00:04:07.025 --> 00:04:11.006]  And when I watch this, I realize how much I'm out of the loop.
[00:04:11.006 --> 00:04:22.169]  I think I've got a handle on the globalists and what they're doing and how they're operating, but I'm mainly reading newspapers and watching cable news and reading government documents and bills.
[00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:33.332]  And the government documents and bills and white papers and MIT and Stanford Research Institute and IBM Prospectus and Google reports to stockholders.
[00:04:35.327 --> 00:04:35.767]  Are you kidding?
[00:04:51.147 --> 00:04:57.169]  I mean, mainstream TV news is quantum mechanics compared to things like Yo Teach.
[00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.229]  I'll explain when we get back and break down all the big news.
[00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:00.190]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:06.052]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[00:05:06.052 --> 00:05:07.352]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[00:05:07.352 --> 00:05:11.613]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[00:05:11.613 --> 00:05:13.474]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[00:05:13.474 --> 00:05:19.796]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[00:05:20.916 --> 00:05:23.797]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[00:05:23.797 --> 00:05:25.537]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[00:05:25.537 --> 00:05:28.538]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[00:05:28.538 --> 00:05:30.258]  And their formula really works.
[00:05:30.258 --> 00:05:33.059]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:34.559]  Try the NutriCafe.
[00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:39.321]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[00:05:39.321 --> 00:05:41.741]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:44.202]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[00:05:44.202 --> 00:05:46.302]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[00:05:46.302 --> 00:05:47.423]  Go to www.
[00:05:57.007 --> 00:06:07.091]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.091 --> 00:06:14.094]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:06:14.671 --> 00:06:21.253]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:21.253 --> 00:06:23.233]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:23.233 --> 00:06:25.734]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:25.734 --> 00:06:37.297]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:06:37.297 --> 00:06:38.978]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:38.978 --> 00:06:40.318]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:06:40.828 --> 00:06:47.736]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:47.736 --> 00:06:56.006]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:56.006 --> 00:06:57.588]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.588 --> 00:06:58.790]  The people strike back.
[00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:05.025]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:07.587]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[00:07:07.587 --> 00:07:17.272]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[00:07:17.272 --> 00:07:23.476]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:26.177]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[00:07:26.177 --> 00:07:28.538]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[00:07:29.679 --> 00:07:36.283]  And he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[00:07:36.283 --> 00:07:46.850]  MZ wants to tell you about a low cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income.
[00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.873]  Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity.
[00:07:50.873 --> 00:07:53.615]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[00:07:53.795 --> 00:07:57.758]  We are going to break down what's happening in Iran today, what's going on in Pakistan, North Korea,
[00:08:24.255 --> 00:08:36.139]  It's as if someone flipped a light switch and global crises are blowing up across the planet.
[00:08:36.139 --> 00:08:41.001]  North Korea is threatening to nuke South Korea or Japan if anyone stops their ships.
[00:08:41.001 --> 00:08:49.724]  This is as great an escalation as the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:08:49.724 --> 00:08:53.505]  Hillary Clinton says they're going to start boarding the North Korean ships.
[00:08:55.387 --> 00:09:09.620]  The White House says China is behind it and supports it, but when you actually read what the Chinese ambassador to the UN has said, he said, do not attack and do not engage in provocation with the North Koreans.
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:15.145]  And they've also told the North Koreans to not engage in provocations.
[00:09:15.145 --> 00:09:17.707]  So more lies by the media.
[00:09:17.707 --> 00:09:20.730]  China does not support what's going on.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:32.883]  And the average dumbed-down person out there who's tuning in for the first time, a mainline liberal or a mainline fake conservative, will think, oh, what, are you for North Korea?
[00:09:32.883 --> 00:09:34.763]  No, I'm not for North Korea.
[00:09:34.763 --> 00:09:48.047]  I'm not for Donald Rumsfeld in the mid-1990s as the chairman of ABB, the Swiss nuke company, transferring the nuclear reactors to North Korea so they could build their atomic weapons.
[00:09:52.935 --> 00:10:01.318]  No, I don't like the fact that the U.S., British, and Israeli governments armed through AQ Khan Laboratories Pakistan.
[00:10:01.318 --> 00:10:05.059]  And then you should ask the question, why are they passing nukes out?
[00:10:05.059 --> 00:10:11.542]  Why are they handing out nuclear weapons like party favors at a six-year-old's birthday party?
[00:10:11.542 --> 00:10:19.685]  To every little third world backwash nation.
[00:10:19.685 --> 00:10:19.905]  Why?
[00:10:21.288 --> 00:10:50.207]  And then you'll understand what surrogate states are, and how they plan to destabilize India, and China, with Pakistan, Afghanistan, North Korea's situation, and Japan, and how Russia's being destabilized and circled by Poland, Ukraine, Czech Republic, Georgia, and other client states of NATO.
[00:10:50.207 --> 00:10:50.868]  It's a fact.
[00:10:51.983 --> 00:11:03.031]  Right as Kim Jong-il's about to transfer power to his son, dying of cancer, dying of multiple strokes, now admitting he's on death's doorstep, probably dead in the next year.
[00:11:03.031 --> 00:11:15.300]  Unless he can hang on by his fingernails with, like Fidel Castro, it's amazing what you can do with government medical care at the highest levels.
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.162]  With top physicians attending to you.
[00:11:22.122 --> 00:11:38.633]  Right when his twenty-something-year-old punk son is about to get power, right when the state is its most dangerous and volatile, they say they're going to start searching their ships for WMDs or any weapons.
[00:11:38.633 --> 00:11:49.060]  Artillery, machine guns, they say you can't sell that to anybody when it's the only export they've got to buy the fuel oil and grain so their inner party can still
[00:11:50.387 --> 00:11:59.273]  Pig out on Colby Beef, and so their population, millions of which have died in the last decade of starvation, can have some chance of living.
[00:11:59.273 --> 00:12:05.778]  I don't want to hear about how we've got to have World War III with North Korea, because they might be shipping out artillery.
[00:12:05.778 --> 00:12:06.699]  Give.
[00:12:06.699 --> 00:12:07.559]  Me.
[00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:08.460]  A break.
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:12.523]  When the New World Order gave them the frickin' nukes.
[00:12:12.523 --> 00:12:19.328]  Now stick that in your fake conservative... You think it's manly to be a warmonger, when you can't even find the stupid country on a map.
[00:12:21.684 --> 00:12:28.786]  You think driving around and flexing your muscles and wearing shirts with big skulls on it and black bandanas is tough?
[00:12:28.786 --> 00:12:37.488]  But you won't learn about the Bill of Rights and Constitution now our nation's been hijacked by foreign bankers who are trying to start World War III.
[00:12:37.488 --> 00:12:41.829]  World War III is a political diversion while they steal everything we've got.
[00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:46.030]  Everything that is nailed down and isn't nailed down.
[00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:51.171]  And I'm not knocking somebody with big muscles wearing black t-shirts with skulls and bandanas on their heads.
[00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:58.009]  Just everywhere I go I see those type of guys.
[00:12:58.009 --> 00:12:58.709]  At Academy.
[00:12:58.709 --> 00:13:07.733]  When I was buying some ammo last night or when I ran into a cafeteria.
[00:13:07.733 --> 00:13:10.074]  I saw these big warrior type men everywhere.
[00:13:10.074 --> 00:13:13.056]  Some guy would jig giant muscles.
[00:13:13.056 --> 00:13:17.938]  Black bandana, big black shirt with a skull on it in there with his wife and kids.
[00:13:17.938 --> 00:13:22.200]  And I guarantee you that guy would urinate all over his leg if the cops pulled him over and told him to get on the ground.
[00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:35.772]  I guarantee you that guy hidden down at the legislature trying to fight bills where the government can kidnap his children without even having a Fourth Amendment or a judge's order.
[00:13:35.772 --> 00:13:48.295]  And I just want to ask you, if you're such a man, outside of watching ice truckers and playing with yourself, why don't you stand up and be a real man?
[00:13:49.943 --> 00:14:01.847]  Why don't you stand up and defend the republic as it's falling, instead of having some vague thing about Apache helicopters shooting Hellfire missiles into brown people's houses.
[00:14:01.847 --> 00:14:11.971]  That's your idea of manhood, just some vague idea of aircraft carriers and missile cruisers launching tomahawks down people's chimneys.
[00:14:11.971 --> 00:14:14.312]  That isn't manhood, jackass!
[00:14:15.572 --> 00:14:20.095]  Manhood is taking care of your family and the country where you live.
[00:14:20.095 --> 00:14:24.077]  You understand a scientific dictatorship has taken over all the farms and ranches?
[00:14:24.077 --> 00:14:26.019]  They're seizing all the major industries.
[00:14:26.019 --> 00:14:30.141]  They're shutting the United States off.
[00:14:30.141 --> 00:14:35.124]  Like you take an old man off life support.
[00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:37.546]  Get your head in gear.
[00:14:37.546 --> 00:14:40.448]  Get your guts in gear and get your brain in gear.
[00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:45.352]  And all you guys in your cowboy hats strutting around your Wranglers acting tough.
[00:14:45.352 --> 00:15:05.306]  I mean, I sit there watching men of America strut around like peacocks, bugging their eyes out at people, bugging their eyes out at some, you know, little old man or something, walking to the bathroom in a restaurant, but you won't stand up for the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:15:05.306 --> 00:15:10.289]  You'll stick American flags made in China by Chinese slaves all over your car.
[00:15:12.179 --> 00:15:19.807]  You like the idea of freedom, but your idea of freedom is tyranny.
[00:15:19.807 --> 00:15:23.271]  I don't mean to get off into that, I just... Where are the men?
[00:15:23.271 --> 00:15:34.663]  You know, they had the Rot Rally here in Austin, and you couldn't hardly go anywhere this Friday, Saturday, Sunday, because of people driving around, bugging their eyes out at people, acting tough on motorcycles.
[00:15:35.842 --> 00:15:38.563]  And I'm not saying you're bad to want to be on a motorcycle.
[00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:47.227]  I've had motorcycles like motorcycles back when I was young and didn't care about dying before I found out I wasn't bulletproof.
[00:15:47.227 --> 00:15:50.128]  Now I've got important work to do so I don't have a motorcycle.
[00:15:50.128 --> 00:15:53.109]  I don't want to risk my life.
[00:15:53.109 --> 00:15:55.050]  I'll only spend my life on something worthy.
[00:15:56.374 --> 00:16:04.440]  And I know it's fun to wear skull shirts and I know it's fun to drive around acting tough and putting on the trappings of a modern-day pirate.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.821]  That's what you do.
[00:16:05.821 --> 00:16:09.044]  And wearing the Iron Cross.
[00:16:09.044 --> 00:16:12.747]  But do you know what the Iron Cross, why you like that symbol of dark power?
[00:16:12.747 --> 00:16:19.632]  Because it meant millions dead from machine gun bullets and nerve gas.
[00:16:19.632 --> 00:16:21.634]  That dark symbol has power because it
[00:16:23.007 --> 00:16:29.131]  Is the totem of giant piles of dead bodies in burnout cities.
[00:16:29.131 --> 00:16:38.637]  And artillery being fired at point-blank range into cowering masses as buildings collapse on them.
[00:16:41.277 --> 00:16:49.684]  Pictured a dead two-year-old little blonde-haired girl with her lower half blown off still clutching a teddy bear in her arms.
[00:16:49.684 --> 00:17:00.554]  Worms crawling in and out of her ears and nose and mouth and smell the dead flesh and then tell me you like the dark power of the Iron Cross.
[00:17:00.554 --> 00:17:05.078]  You don't know anything about the Iron Cross or the gates of hell.
[00:17:08.345 --> 00:17:20.871]  You don't know anything about the stench of dead children, but it will soon be in your nostrils if you continue to conjure hell and death.
[00:17:20.871 --> 00:17:29.555]  You hear the howl and the grind of the gears of death, and you think it makes a beautiful sound from far away.
[00:17:32.338 --> 00:17:40.040]  And it does have a black majesty, a dark majesty, like the smokestacks of Hades.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:54.183]  But once you've been delivered to the lands of the four horses, you will no longer love the darkness!
[00:17:54.183 --> 00:17:56.824]  You grasp at the darkness because you are weak!
[00:17:57.935 --> 00:18:00.255]  And because subconsciously you fear it!
[00:18:00.255 --> 00:18:04.296]  So you think by embracing it, it gives you power over it!
[00:18:04.296 --> 00:18:09.157]  You have no power over darkness!
[00:18:09.157 --> 00:18:18.179]  In darkness, the only power over darkness is the light!
[00:18:18.179 --> 00:18:22.740]  And not the counterfeit of the light, the loving, limp-wristed dove of the liberals.
[00:18:24.639 --> 00:18:31.923]  The fake oozing death, yet nothing but another vehicle of the true darkness.
[00:18:31.923 --> 00:18:46.732]  No, one must find the true light, not its many counterfeits, not the velvet-gloved eugenicist who loves the black, who loves the brown, who loves you and saddles up to you.
[00:18:46.732 --> 00:18:54.237]  The true darkness rarely festoons itself in its true cloak of iron
[00:18:56.562 --> 00:19:00.024]  And fire.
[00:19:00.024 --> 00:19:07.288]  It wears that of a sheep.
[00:19:07.288 --> 00:19:19.035]  And it baws sweetly in your ear for the carbon taxes and helping the children.
[00:19:19.035 --> 00:19:20.516]  And it whispers in your ears
[00:19:23.328 --> 00:19:37.619]  Spells that turn your bones to jelly and your heart to weak, shivering cold.
[00:19:37.619 --> 00:19:47.567]  I will break down the news that we have before us on the other side of this transmission
[00:19:50.862 --> 00:19:58.157]  On the other side of these ads, those merchants that fund our vessels.
[00:20:01.218 --> 00:20:03.199]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:20:03.199 --> 00:20:10.162]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:20:10.162 --> 00:20:18.565]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:20:18.565 --> 00:20:24.288]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:20:24.488 --> 00:20:26.309]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:28.490]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:33.033]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:20:33.033 --> 00:20:35.254]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:20:35.254 --> 00:20:43.079]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:20:43.319 --> 00:20:43.619]  We're good.
[00:21:01.371 --> 00:21:07.414]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:07.414 --> 00:21:13.276]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:21:13.276 --> 00:21:19.439]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:21.740]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.222]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:21:24.222 --> 00:21:37.409]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:21:37.409 --> 00:21:39.070]  It's not about left or right.
[00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.931]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:21:40.931 --> 00:21:47.155]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:21:47.842 --> 00:21:56.100]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.683]  The Obama Deception.
[00:21:57.683 --> 00:21:58.885]  The people strike back!
[00:22:00.501 --> 00:22:07.168]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:07.168 --> 00:22:15.295]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:15.295 --> 00:22:20.881]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[00:22:21.201 --> 00:22:23.462]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[00:22:23.462 --> 00:22:28.545]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:28.545 --> 00:22:33.768]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:33.768 --> 00:22:38.110]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:39.211]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:39.211 --> 00:22:43.713]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:22:43.713 --> 00:22:44.634]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:22:48.596 --> 00:22:51.597]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:22:51.597 --> 00:22:55.499]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:55.499 --> 00:22:56.939]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:56.939 --> 00:23:02.541]  The phone rings, and the questions are asked.
[00:23:02.541 --> 00:23:03.782]  I've been so sick!
[00:23:03.782 --> 00:23:05.462]  Will the life change tea help me?
[00:23:05.462 --> 00:23:06.863]  Our answer is always the same.
[00:23:07.321 --> 00:23:13.443]  Yes, toxins and chemicals from food, water, and air are attacking you this very moment.
[00:23:13.443 --> 00:23:19.325]  Fight back with our all-natural detoxifying tea that works immediately.
[00:23:19.325 --> 00:23:23.847]  Many companies use gimmicks and misleading free trials for their campaign.
[00:23:23.847 --> 00:23:25.248]  We use results.
[00:23:25.248 --> 00:23:30.009]  Life Change Tea's formula created by a PhD has been around for over 20 years.
[00:23:30.009 --> 00:23:34.271]  There are things happening in the world that are unseen and not healthy.
[00:23:34.611 --> 00:23:38.492]  The public has reached its all-time record for chronic sickness.
[00:23:38.492 --> 00:23:42.373]  This atrocity won't change unless you call us right now.
[00:23:42.373 --> 00:23:47.334]  Our number is 9-2-8-3-0-8-0-4-0-8.
[00:23:47.334 --> 00:23:50.335]  Again, that's 9-2-8-3-0-8-0-4-0-8.
[00:23:50.335 --> 00:23:54.096]  Or you can order online at GetTheTee.com.
[00:23:54.096 --> 00:23:56.636]  That's GetTheTee.com.
[00:23:56.636 --> 00:23:59.237]  And remember, we have the cheapest shipping in the industry.
[00:24:19.969 --> 00:24:26.472]  And the old nations of the West were seduced by the dark side.
[00:24:26.472 --> 00:24:33.195]  One by one they fell to the sway of the banks and the wicked social engineers.
[00:24:33.195 --> 00:24:45.701]  The pitch men, the psychiatrists, the sociologists that waged war on the minds of the mass.
[00:24:45.701 --> 00:24:46.722]  And the family fell.
[00:24:48.945 --> 00:25:00.032]  The farms, the ranches, any form of independence was reduced to slack.
[00:25:00.032 --> 00:25:04.234]  The mind war rolled on.
[00:25:04.234 --> 00:25:09.077]  Would the public wake themselves from the trance?
[00:25:09.077 --> 00:25:18.463]  Or would they be pushed inexorably towards the cliff to ever fall into total dehumanization?
[00:25:21.807 --> 00:25:39.798]  All of the tyranny we have witnessed so far is only the preparation for the great feast of devils of the vampires of the New World Order against you free humanity.
[00:25:39.798 --> 00:25:43.201]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:25:43.201 --> 00:25:44.001]  to 3 p.m.
[00:25:44.001 --> 00:25:48.824]  Central Standard Time we're here live and back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:25:48.824 --> 00:25:50.045]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:25:53.433 --> 00:25:55.834]  All right, let me just run through some of the news that's coming up.
[00:25:55.834 --> 00:25:58.195]  David Icke in the third and fourth hour today.
[00:25:58.195 --> 00:26:03.376]  I'm going to talk about this coming up later in the hour.
[00:26:03.376 --> 00:26:05.637]  This is the huge announcement.
[00:26:05.637 --> 00:26:07.258]  It's just so important.
[00:26:07.258 --> 00:26:10.058]  So many things clicked when I saw this last night.
[00:26:10.058 --> 00:26:14.880]  Things I'd already known, things I'd talked about many, many times, but never articulated fully.
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.461]  Things I'd thought about a million times.
[00:26:16.461 --> 00:26:17.701]  Everything you'd thought about, too.
[00:26:19.714 --> 00:26:23.837]  We're all thinking the same thing here, that we're in way over our heads.
[00:26:23.837 --> 00:26:26.738]  But we don't have a choice but to fight on.
[00:26:26.738 --> 00:26:31.501]  Corporate media, cyber bullying propaganda, I'm gonna get into that.
[00:26:31.501 --> 00:26:37.905]  Roundup hate speech promoters, this is being announced all over national news.
[00:26:37.905 --> 00:26:46.210]  They're just saying arrest anybody that criticizes the government, and of the three or four names they throw around, guess who is in the mix?
[00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:47.351]  Alex Jones.
[00:26:51.656 --> 00:26:59.842]  I don't agree with the classic people that are singled out for hate crime and hate speech and thought crime and pre-crime.
[00:26:59.842 --> 00:27:15.013]  But I've also been very careful not to step on those landmines as well because I don't want to be associated with the nest of government operatives and their foolish cohorts who don't know they're being led along to the slaughter.
[00:27:17.076 --> 00:27:18.017]  So we'll talk about that.
[00:27:18.017 --> 00:27:20.518]  Also, JP Morgan hires supertanker for storage.
[00:27:20.518 --> 00:27:24.941]  Brokers say, I had this laying on my desk a week ago, never got to it.
[00:27:24.941 --> 00:27:27.403]  I was cleaning off my desk and saw it.
[00:27:27.403 --> 00:27:33.467]  This is just a nice microcosm example of the unbelievable corruption.
[00:27:33.467 --> 00:27:45.516]  Bloomberg admits that JP Morgan, like last summer, is buying giant, leasing giant, triple-hull supertankers, filling them full of heating oil and crude oil,
[00:27:47.694 --> 00:27:55.535]  And in some cases gasoline, even more refined and expensive.
[00:27:55.535 --> 00:28:11.258]  And they are parking them off Malta and other islands in the Med to artificially bid up the price and jack up the price.
[00:28:11.258 --> 00:28:12.239]  There's a huge
[00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:21.211]  Glut of oil, too much oil.
[00:28:21.211 --> 00:28:22.132]  That's on the markets.
[00:28:22.132 --> 00:28:24.733]  The price was plunging down to $32 a barrel.
[00:28:24.733 --> 00:28:30.575]  And so JP Morgan takes the trillions of dollars pumped into brokerage firms and private banks.
[00:28:30.575 --> 00:28:38.079]  They take your tax money and they put it in to oil and other commodities.
[00:28:38.079 --> 00:28:42.320]  They hoard it, but drives up the price.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:47.783]  You pay for it with your tax money and then it's another indirect tax to them.
[00:28:50.157 --> 00:28:54.578]  In that you will pay more in the gas that they've speculated and driven up.
[00:28:54.578 --> 00:29:04.421]  And then they'll dump it on the market after bidding it up and make even bigger profits.
[00:29:04.421 --> 00:29:08.263]  And that's just one little way they rape us in this rigged, fake economy.
[00:29:08.263 --> 00:29:10.843]  This is not free market and it's not socialism.
[00:29:10.843 --> 00:29:13.124]  It's a pirate economy.
[00:29:13.124 --> 00:29:14.805]  It's a predator economy.
[00:29:14.805 --> 00:29:16.165]  It's a joke economy.
[00:29:19.451 --> 00:29:22.814]  I thought I'd mention that.
[00:29:22.814 --> 00:29:24.155]  Headline, Judgment Day.
[00:29:24.155 --> 00:29:29.519]  Broke California faces shutdown at Arnie Schwartzenhager's hands.
[00:29:29.519 --> 00:29:37.425]  NORAD and NORTHCOM exercise plan for mid-June kicks off in two days.
[00:29:37.425 --> 00:29:44.511]  Got a bunch of other key news coming up on Iran and North Korea.
[00:29:46.007 --> 00:29:53.978]  American Al Qaeda member acknowledges Jewish ancestry, CNN, Canadian Jewish Congress organizes... We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.978 --> 00:29:57.624]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.506 --> 00:30:05.710]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:09.734]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.734 --> 00:30:15.639]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:15.639 --> 00:30:20.503]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.703 --> 00:30:21.624]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.624 --> 00:30:27.252]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:30:27.252 --> 00:30:27.933]  Number 4.
[00:30:27.933 --> 00:30:30.836]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[00:30:30.836 --> 00:30:34.481]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:34.481 --> 00:30:35.342]  Number 5.
[00:30:35.342 --> 00:30:38.967]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[00:30:39.187 --> 00:30:44.909]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:49.610]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:51.390]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:53.951]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[00:30:56.632 --> 00:30:57.312]  It is a big idea.
[00:30:57.312 --> 00:30:58.732]  A new world order in the near future.
[00:31:07.199 --> 00:31:09.682]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:31:09.682 --> 00:31:13.105]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:31:13.105 --> 00:31:15.888]  Put their objective being world domination.
[00:31:15.888 --> 00:31:19.071]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:31:19.071 --> 00:31:26.398]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:31:29.417 --> 00:31:34.841]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:31:34.841 --> 00:31:38.723]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:31:38.723 --> 00:31:41.285]  Bill Burdick is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:31:41.285 --> 00:31:42.466]  Most people have no idea.
[00:31:42.466 --> 00:31:43.226]  They're not after money.
[00:31:43.226 --> 00:31:44.527]  They have all the money they need.
[00:31:44.527 --> 00:31:45.488]  They're after power.
[00:31:45.488 --> 00:31:46.649]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:31:55.374 --> 00:31:58.176]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:31:58.176 --> 00:31:59.237]  You have been warned.
[00:31:59.377 --> 00:32:02.219]  Yeah.
[00:32:02.219 --> 00:32:07.844]  If we could all see the germs that we encounter each day, we might have a different outlook on how we view our surroundings.
[00:32:07.844 --> 00:32:10.586]  In the past, you may not have put too much thought into it.
[00:32:10.586 --> 00:32:14.609]  But with the current health risks in the world today, it's impossible to ignore it.
[00:32:14.609 --> 00:32:17.191]  There is a solution, and it's called Hazred.
[00:32:17.191 --> 00:32:26.279]  Hazred utilizes a fogging device that disinfects, sanitizes, and protects against influenza, viruses, bacteria, allergen, mold, and more.
[00:32:27.125 --> 00:32:30.186]  It's tough on germs, but not on children and pets.
[00:32:30.186 --> 00:32:39.949]  You'll receive the Fogger Liquid Concentrate, enough to make up to 32 gallons of germ-killing power, three respirators, goggles, protective suit, and heavy-duty gloves.

[00:32:53.874 --> 00:32:56.696]  That's H-A-Z-A-R-I-D.
[00:32:56.696 --> 00:32:57.196]  Protect.
[00:32:57.196 --> 00:32:57.917]  Prepare.
[00:32:57.917 --> 00:32:58.837]  Get your hazard today.
[00:33:23.544 --> 00:33:29.365]  You know, I say I've got this big revelation for everybody right now.
[00:33:29.365 --> 00:33:34.006]  But the revelation is that we don't know how right we've really been.
[00:33:34.006 --> 00:33:45.408]  When we sit around saying it's like the public's on drugs, they're dumbed down, it's like they're in a trance, they can't wake up.
[00:33:45.408 --> 00:33:46.849]  They are.
[00:33:46.849 --> 00:33:48.989]  And a lot goes into this cocktail.
[00:33:51.957 --> 00:33:58.442]  But when I saw this last night, it hit me like a thunderbolt.
[00:33:58.442 --> 00:34:04.346]  And so I ran in at about midnight, and I turned on television.
[00:34:04.346 --> 00:34:10.731]  And I began flipping around, trying to find newer sitcoms, newer shows, newer dramas.
[00:34:10.731 --> 00:34:17.997]  And I did find those on The Children's and... I'm sorry, folks just walked in with a message.
[00:34:17.997 --> 00:34:18.717]  Hold on.
[00:34:18.717 --> 00:34:19.398]  Hold on just a moment.
[00:34:42.287 --> 00:34:43.668]  No, that happens more and more.
[00:34:43.668 --> 00:34:50.310]  I had some folks come in and talk to me.
[00:34:50.310 --> 00:35:09.678]  But if you watch television, you notice and you see that they are dumbing the language down more and more and more and more and more and more.
[00:35:12.771 --> 00:35:29.054]  And then when you talk to the general public, they are almost unable to even form intelligible sentences.
[00:35:34.892 --> 00:35:39.955]  And I wrote a bunch of notes on this last night and then got distracted right before I left my house and didn't bring them down here.
[00:35:39.955 --> 00:35:45.958]  So I'm going to get into that with David Icke coming up when he's on the show with us today.
[00:35:45.958 --> 00:35:52.121]  And this whole Iran situation and the North Korea situation, there's just no end to it.
[00:35:52.121 --> 00:35:58.084]  And the Rand Corporation is on record saying they want to get World War III going so they can help bring in the new world order.
[00:35:58.084 --> 00:36:01.566]  They need this global crisis to offer the global solution.
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:13.669]  And I'm just so sick of the Globalist and all the criminal activity they're carrying out.
[00:36:13.669 --> 00:36:24.440]  But before I get into all of that today, I want to first play this clip from Anderson Cooper on CNN.
[00:36:31.923 --> 00:36:43.828]  Anderson Cooper, who, when I get up on air and I say he's CIA, he admits he was recruited by the CIA out of college, but then says he didn't like it and went into media.
[00:36:43.828 --> 00:36:50.471]  And there's even mainstream news articles where they report on themselves like it's no big deal and just acclimate everybody.
[00:36:50.471 --> 00:36:52.792]  We've got some of those up on Infowars.com today.
[00:36:52.792 --> 00:37:00.055]  There's an article, How the Spooks Took Over the Media, and they just brag that they run CNN and Fox.
[00:37:01.348 --> 00:37:04.010]  And MSNBC.
[00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:10.594]  And they always have, to a certain extent, the producers and the editors and the heads of the TV companies.
[00:37:10.594 --> 00:37:17.818]  But now, now it's just right out in the open.
[00:37:17.818 --> 00:37:22.821]  But the general public doesn't know that.
[00:37:22.821 --> 00:37:26.443]  You know, George Orwell worked at the BBC in propaganda.
[00:37:26.443 --> 00:37:27.524]  BBC is government.
[00:37:28.194 --> 00:37:30.235]  And is propaganda.
[00:37:30.235 --> 00:37:38.959]  What it has to pose is a fake conservative, fake liberal amalgamation of egalitarian compassion.
[00:37:38.959 --> 00:37:48.544]  When really it's a bunch of cold-blooded, control-freak, criminal eugenicists who rationalize all the terrible things they do because they're carrying out eugenics against the population.
[00:37:48.544 --> 00:37:55.067]  But, yesterday on the Sunday Show, I didn't have time to get into much of this, but I want to now, the gangster government
[00:37:57.369 --> 00:37:59.891]  Now, we've certainly always had corruption in the state.
[00:37:59.891 --> 00:38:07.437]  The state's not perfect, and the state more often than not, 99% of the time, goes rogue and criminal and abuses the people.
[00:38:07.437 --> 00:38:16.083]  That's why you've got to have a rule of law and tie the hands of the state, and it's better that ten guilty men go free than one innocent man be imprisoned.
[00:38:16.083 --> 00:38:22.408]  But now I've heard prosecutors and federal judges say, meh, better some innocent people go to jail than criminals go loose.
[00:38:23.735 --> 00:38:26.336]  Ah, you would expect a criminal to talk like that.
[00:38:26.336 --> 00:38:28.457]  Oh, torture's good if the good guys do it.
[00:38:28.457 --> 00:38:30.618]  And oh, secret arrest is good.
[00:38:30.618 --> 00:38:36.360]  It's only for foreigners and now citizens.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.882]  And warrantless wiretapping is good.
[00:38:38.882 --> 00:38:40.882]  And we're going to do it to citizens.
[00:38:40.882 --> 00:38:45.444]  Been doing it.
[00:38:45.444 --> 00:38:47.905]  But I told a story briefly at the end of the show yesterday.
[00:38:47.905 --> 00:38:48.686]  I ran out of time.
[00:38:48.686 --> 00:38:50.867]  Me and one of my friends had been at the beach.
[00:38:51.874 --> 00:39:18.935]  When I was still in high school, in fact I was only 16, my buddy was a 17, we'd been down visiting friends at the Texas beach and we were driving back to Dallas on I-45 and a local cop, some little town, pulls us over and he wants to search the car and my buddy Mark, it was actually Mark did it, I just played along, had a big swastika right on his forearm
[00:39:22.012 --> 00:39:28.377]  And, uh, Mark said, Oh, nice tattoo, kind of in a smart mouth way.
[00:39:28.377 --> 00:39:29.478]  And the guys like, Oh, you like it?
[00:39:29.478 --> 00:39:32.880]  And did a little, a little how Hitler to us.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.303]  And we just kind of looked at him and smiled and he let us go.
[00:39:36.303 --> 00:39:37.464]  I guess he thought we were with him.
[00:39:37.464 --> 00:39:44.629]  And I found in a lot of these cases, the reason I bring that up is if you're black or Hispanic,
[00:39:46.991 --> 00:39:49.912]  They're going to take your car, take your money, take everything you got.
[00:39:49.912 --> 00:39:51.192]  And it's on national news.
[00:39:51.192 --> 00:40:01.076]  Now, in South Texas, in El Cenizo and scores of other little towns, the Mexican flag is flown at the city halls.
[00:40:01.076 --> 00:40:02.776]  I told you about this in 1998.
[00:40:02.776 --> 00:40:05.737]  It's now been on mainstream news.
[00:40:05.737 --> 00:40:08.098]  Whitewashing it, though.
[00:40:08.098 --> 00:40:10.299]  And if you're a gringo and you come in those towns,
[00:40:11.414 --> 00:40:21.943]  It's just like going to Mexico and you're a dumb gringo where they take your car and shake you down and put you in prison and run your credit line and have your family pay $20,000 to get you out of Mexico.
[00:40:21.943 --> 00:40:24.565]  So my point is, this is what any predator group does.
[00:40:24.565 --> 00:40:29.289]  They always say, oh, we're only predators if we're white on the blacks and Mexicans.
[00:40:29.289 --> 00:40:32.152]  And then if you're Mexican, you're only a predator on the blacks and the whites.
[00:40:34.824 --> 00:40:36.905]  And that's how the criminality always works.
[00:40:36.905 --> 00:40:41.108]  Or in the South, oh, you're a Yankee, we're gonna take what you got and beat you up.
[00:40:41.108 --> 00:40:46.872]  Or if you're in the North, ah, you shouldn't be up here in New Jersey with Texas plates.
[00:40:46.872 --> 00:40:48.954]  See, it's always done to the outsider.
[00:40:48.954 --> 00:40:50.455]  And the tyrants know how to do this.
[00:40:50.455 --> 00:40:57.780]  Oh, we're only taking the rights of the brown Muslims, of the Iraqis, of the Afghans.
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:01.643]  And they know how your primitive mindset works, the tribalism.
[00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:31.800]  It's all carried out scientifically, but when the Feds come out, Anderson, CIA, Cooper, and does report after report, week after week, of different Texas towns, and they still even kind of whitewash it, folks, they pull over old ladies and grab $3,000 out of their wallet, take their watch, take their earrings, take their car, put them in jail for a week and say, sign this form saying you won't sue and won't contest or we're going to go ahead and charge you with drug dealing.
[00:41:33.755 --> 00:41:34.756]  And the Feds do it.
[00:41:34.756 --> 00:41:47.954]  I've seen 60 Minutes shows about how people try to get on an airplane and they see them pay with cash and then they search their bags and find $10,000 and the guy goes, yeah.
[00:41:47.954 --> 00:41:50.617]  One case of a guy in North Carolina, he flies to Houston every year.
[00:41:53.032 --> 00:42:01.842]  Pay for the freight shipments, but to pick the trees is a landscape company owner that he's going to have shipped about 18-wheeler all the way to the Carolinas.
[00:42:01.842 --> 00:42:04.665]  I remember that case because we interviewed him.
[00:42:04.665 --> 00:42:08.490]  Saw it on 60 Minutes and I had him on probably 12 years ago.
[00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:09.131]  And they don't care.
[00:42:09.131 --> 00:42:10.032]  No judge, no jury.
[00:42:10.032 --> 00:42:11.493]  They just grabbed the 10 grand out of his pocket.
[00:42:13.223 --> 00:42:14.504]  Briefcase.
[00:42:14.504 --> 00:42:16.405]  They don't care if there's tax records of it.
[00:42:16.405 --> 00:42:17.846]  They don't care if he owns the business.
[00:42:17.846 --> 00:42:19.667]  They don't care if he has receipts.
[00:42:19.667 --> 00:42:21.948]  Listen, you're a slave and we're taking it.
[00:42:21.948 --> 00:42:33.394]  And that ticket taker up there gets a bigger paycheck every year from the government than they do for running the ticket counter.
[00:42:33.394 --> 00:42:42.800]  So my point is, the hoity-toity New York CIA Astor boy, heir to the Astor fortune, Anderson Cooper,
[00:42:44.946 --> 00:42:58.953]  He likes to make it all about how it's us buck-toothed, redneck, tobacco-chewing Texans that shake people down.
[00:42:58.953 --> 00:43:01.974]  Yeah, like the cops don't shake people down in New York City.
[00:43:01.974 --> 00:43:06.376]  Like the cops don't shake people down all over that state.
[00:43:06.376 --> 00:43:08.117]  Like you don't have your own brand of hillbilly.
[00:43:13.683 --> 00:43:17.226]  The issue is, this is going on everywhere.
[00:43:17.226 --> 00:43:19.227]  The Russians love to point out our corruption.
[00:43:19.227 --> 00:43:20.529]  We love to point out theirs.
[00:43:20.529 --> 00:43:23.391]  It's always nice to point at somebody else and say, that's a bad man.
[00:43:23.391 --> 00:43:28.815]  When evil is pandemic across the globe and it starts in our hearts and our minds.
[00:43:28.815 --> 00:43:31.998]  And fixing it is about changing ourselves one person at a time.
[00:43:31.998 --> 00:43:34.600]  Because you get yourself right with God.
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:36.061]  You get yourself right morally.
[00:43:36.061 --> 00:43:39.083]  You're not going to believe these 501c3 whore churches.
[00:43:39.083 --> 00:43:42.446]  You're going to know you've got to be out fighting corruption.
[00:43:42.446 --> 00:43:43.387]  It's going to compel you.
[00:43:45.854 --> 00:43:51.437]  Instead, the fake spirit of Christianity in the churches today tells folks to lay down to it.
[00:43:51.437 --> 00:43:53.538]  Anyways, I wanted to play this clip of a whitewash.
[00:43:53.538 --> 00:43:56.820]  This is a town right outside Austin.
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:02.523]  And they don't just grab the blacks and the Hispanics stuff.
[00:44:02.523 --> 00:44:13.269]  They like grabbing your college kids and they like, you know, they catch a college kid with half a marijuana cigarette, that big brand new Chevy Tahoe daddy bought junior is gone.
[00:44:14.235 --> 00:44:17.118]  And the $3,000 is gone.
[00:44:17.118 --> 00:44:19.220]  And the Junior's caught with pills.
[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:20.581]  Everything's taken.
[00:44:20.581 --> 00:44:24.244]  A lot of times the cops just keep it for themselves and don't even enroll it.
[00:44:24.244 --> 00:44:26.426]  And the judges take the money for themselves.
[00:44:26.426 --> 00:44:27.607]  Let's go ahead and play this piece.
[00:44:27.607 --> 00:44:27.988]  Here it is.
[00:44:28.564 --> 00:44:35.409]  This report takes us back to the heart of Texas, where Gary Tuchman has found another county awash in both cash and allegations of corruption.
[00:44:35.409 --> 00:44:40.173]  The money, more than a million dollars last year, was seized from drivers who were pulled over by cops.
[00:44:40.173 --> 00:44:42.815]  There are allegations that some of those drivers were innocent.
[00:44:42.815 --> 00:44:44.997]  So, what's happening to all that money?
[00:44:44.997 --> 00:44:47.739]  Well, that's where so many people, that's why so many people are steamed.
[00:44:47.739 --> 00:44:51.061]  Gary Tuchman tonight is keeping them up.
[00:44:51.061 --> 00:44:55.505]  The dusty roads here in Texas Hill Country have been a goldmine for police and prosecutors.
[00:44:56.203 --> 00:45:01.250]  But some defense attorneys call it the best little rip-off in Texas.
[00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:07.678]  It makes Texans look like buffoons, and it makes it look like all of our judges and police officers are crooks down here.
[00:45:07.678 --> 00:45:14.407]  In Texas and other states, cops can pull over drivers suspected of serious crimes, and they can actually seize their cash and valuables.
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:22.862]  Four times the former DA here spent tens of thousands of it for all-expense-paid trips to Hawaii for himself, some of his staff, and spouses.
[00:45:22.862 --> 00:45:25.343]  Do you think it was okay to spend that money to go to Hawaii?
[00:45:25.343 --> 00:45:26.343]  Absolutely.
[00:45:26.343 --> 00:45:28.104]  Why do you think that?
[00:45:28.104 --> 00:45:29.464]  Well, it's part of the United States.
[00:45:29.464 --> 00:45:32.345]  Last time I checked, we have conferences all over the other states.
[00:45:32.345 --> 00:45:33.786]  What's the difference in Hawaii?
[00:45:33.786 --> 00:45:40.068]  The organizers of the annual trip to this resort in Oahu invite spouses, sweeties, friends.
[00:45:40.068 --> 00:45:44.169]  The trip does include 10 hours of law seminars, 10 hours out of an entire week,
[00:45:44.724 --> 00:45:47.585]  The rest of the time is for sun, golf, and luau's.
[00:45:47.585 --> 00:45:48.025]  The price?
[00:45:48.025 --> 00:45:49.666]  4,000 bucks a couple.
[00:45:49.666 --> 00:45:52.427]  Steep, but not what it's paid for by public money.
[00:45:52.427 --> 00:45:54.428]  Made back home on the highway.
[00:45:54.428 --> 00:45:57.329]  Ron Sutton was the district attorney here for 32 years.
[00:45:57.329 --> 00:46:00.950]  He didn't run again this fall, but he's still working part-time in the DA's office.
[00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:05.592]  But could you understand, sir, how it kind of looks bad to people that you're going to Hawaii four times a month?
[00:46:05.592 --> 00:46:08.533]  Only to those people who are jealous because they haven't been to Hawaii.
[00:46:08.533 --> 00:46:11.694]  The money used by the former DA came from the Texas forfeiture law.
[00:46:12.245 --> 00:46:26.273]  District Attorney's offices get a cut of the seizure money and are allowed to use the cash for quote, official purposes, which the former DA says is... Anything used in connection with promoting and functioning of the office or training could be anything.
[00:46:26.273 --> 00:46:27.433]  It's outrageous.
[00:46:27.433 --> 00:46:31.636]  Texas State Senator John Whitmire says the forfeiture law often leads to corruption.
[00:46:31.636 --> 00:46:35.898]  The law that I am going to change is so general
[00:46:36.559 --> 00:46:40.280]  That they can literally get away with stealing in my mind.
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:44.221]  The purpose of forfeitures is to strip real criminals of ill-gotten gains.
[00:46:44.221 --> 00:46:50.584]  Although in Texas, there have been many accusations that innocent people, often minorities, are targeted and pulled over.
[00:46:50.584 --> 00:46:56.906]  Deputies told this man he was driving too long in the passing lane.
[00:46:56.906 --> 00:46:59.967]  It got violent.
[00:46:59.967 --> 00:47:01.847]  The driver, a Latino and a U.S.
[00:47:01.847 --> 00:47:04.128]  Navy veteran, was charged with endangering police.
[00:47:04.875 --> 00:47:07.856]  After his lawyer got his hands on this video, charges were dropped.
[00:47:07.856 --> 00:47:11.917]  It was probably a classic profile stop.
[00:47:11.917 --> 00:47:15.118]  This is the Kimball County seat of Junction, Texas.
[00:47:15.118 --> 00:47:18.958]  There are only 4,400 people who live in this entire county.
[00:47:18.958 --> 00:47:20.079]  This is Main Street.
[00:47:20.079 --> 00:47:22.439]  You can see it's a quiet, sleepy place.
[00:47:22.439 --> 00:47:26.080]  But the Sheriff's Department deputies here are very active and busy.
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:28.961]  Getting forfeiture money is a very important industry here.
[00:47:29.648 --> 00:47:30.628]  How important?
[00:47:30.628 --> 00:47:34.970]  The Sheriff's Office keeps more than an average of $1 million annually in forfeitures.
[00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:39.151]  The former DA says he had more than $1 million in his account when he left office.
[00:47:39.151 --> 00:47:43.353]  He says Hawaii wasn't a vacation, but a way to learn and get legal credits.
[00:47:43.353 --> 00:47:47.514]  But beyond paying for airfares and hotel rooms, there's spending money for the group.
[00:47:47.514 --> 00:47:51.016]  Here's a check paid to cash for $6,000 to cover the week.
[00:47:51.016 --> 00:47:53.157]  Why do you guys need $6,000?
[00:47:53.157 --> 00:47:54.937]  Well, if you go to Hawaii, you'll see why.
[00:47:54.937 --> 00:47:56.598]  A hamburger and a drink's $20.
[00:47:57.717 --> 00:47:59.838]  But what really got our attention was this.
[00:47:59.838 --> 00:48:04.421]  The former DA says that one year he took this man to Hawaii, Emil Prohl.
[00:48:04.421 --> 00:48:07.282]  He's the judge who hears forfeiture cases.
[00:48:07.282 --> 00:48:11.904]  Well, wouldn't it have been better to say, Judge, you can't come with us to Hawaii because we're using forfeiture money?
[00:48:11.904 --> 00:48:14.066]  Well, that issue has never come up until right now.
[00:48:14.066 --> 00:48:14.846]  Okay, so what's your answer?
[00:48:15.538 --> 00:48:17.099]  The answer is I don't see anything wrong with it.
[00:48:17.099 --> 00:48:18.979]  It's help educating the judge.
[00:48:18.979 --> 00:48:20.280]  And what about this?
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:24.282]  Our search through the public records shows checks written directly to the judge.
[00:48:24.282 --> 00:48:28.063]  Here's one for $3,000.
[00:48:28.063 --> 00:48:28.423]  $4,000.
[00:48:28.423 --> 00:48:28.804]  $4,500.
[00:48:28.804 --> 00:48:31.605]  Why were checks written directly to the judge from the forfeiture account?
[00:48:31.605 --> 00:48:33.405]  To raise expenses and coverages.
[00:48:33.405 --> 00:48:37.067]  Can you see how taxpayers might say, you know, a little more documentation would be nicer.
[00:48:37.705 --> 00:48:41.788]  Well, in retrospect, maybe so, but I know I did nothing wrong.
[00:48:41.788 --> 00:48:43.169]  My conscience is clear.
[00:48:43.169 --> 00:48:48.532]  We asked for an interview with the judge, but we're told he did not want to talk, but we needed his side of the story.
[00:48:48.532 --> 00:48:51.994]  So we caught up with him outside the courthouse to ask about his Hawaii trip.
[00:48:51.994 --> 00:48:54.396]  You know, I'm really not able to comment on that at this point.
[00:48:54.396 --> 00:48:55.576]  I appreciate your interest.
[00:48:55.576 --> 00:48:58.378]  At some point, I hope I can, but at this point, I can't.
[00:48:58.378 --> 00:48:59.799]  But I appreciate your interest.
[00:48:59.799 --> 00:49:01.220]  How come you can't comment about it?
[00:49:03.383 --> 00:49:05.044]  There's just issues.
[00:49:05.044 --> 00:49:12.148]  I've got forfeiture cases still pending, and I can't... That's why I'm talking about this, because you hear the forfeiture cases, but that's the issue.
[00:49:12.148 --> 00:49:14.510]  I understand, and we're dealing with that issue.
[00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:17.472]  There is a new DA here in Texas Hill Country.
[00:49:17.472 --> 00:49:21.874]  He says there will be no more trips to Hawaii.
[00:49:21.874 --> 00:49:23.856]  So, Mr. Carroll, let me just get a couple questions.
[00:49:23.856 --> 00:49:25.036]  Let me just get this straight, though.
[00:49:25.036 --> 00:49:30.320]  The judge who's hearing the forfeiture cases is getting cash money from the forfeiture cases?
[00:49:31.966 --> 00:49:42.536]  Right, he's gotten expenses for at least one Hawaii trip, and he's also gotten cash money to, according to the old district attorney, to attend conferences, but it's not really well documented.
[00:49:42.536 --> 00:49:46.340]  To say the least, and the state senator told you that he wants to toughen the forfeiture law.
[00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:47.561]  What's the situation with that?
[00:49:47.561 --> 00:49:48.162]  Is that happening?
[00:49:49.474 --> 00:49:52.076]  Well, we've done three stories now on these forfeiture laws in Texas.
[00:49:52.076 --> 00:49:56.338]  Since we started doing the stories, the state senate voted unanimously for tougher laws.
[00:49:56.338 --> 00:49:58.960]  A house committee voted unanimously for tougher laws.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:04.983]  It's expected the governor would sign the bill, but then the full house dithered and dathered, never got around to it.
[00:50:04.983 --> 00:50:08.185]  The legislative session ended last week, and here's the kicker.
[00:50:08.185 --> 00:50:13.288]  Texas only meets its legislature every two years, so a new law now can't be passed until 2011.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:28.908]  And just in case viewers think, oh, I saw this story already, you did this a couple weeks ago, this is an entirely different town than the other place where they were taking money from drivers and not giving it back when those drivers turned out to be innocent of anything.
[00:50:28.908 --> 00:50:40.215]  Let's make it clear, there's a lot of counties in Texas where there are no allegations whatsoever, but we have found so far at least three where there are substantial allegations of alleged improprieties involving this forfeiture account.
[00:50:41.124 --> 00:50:43.927]  Are you a little nervous driving through some of these counties in Texas, Gary?
[00:50:43.927 --> 00:50:45.268]  I hope you have people with you.
[00:50:45.268 --> 00:50:47.150]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:50.453]  That's about federalizing all the police.
[00:50:50.453 --> 00:50:52.916]  So they can carry out their corruption more scientifically.
[00:50:52.916 --> 00:50:55.959]  We'll be right back, finish breaking it down.
[00:50:55.959 --> 00:50:58.602]  I'll continue the series as we look at gangster government.
[00:51:01.124 --> 00:51:04.565]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:51:04.565 --> 00:51:08.827]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:51:08.827 --> 00:51:20.472]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:51:20.472 --> 00:51:26.314]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[00:51:26.554 --> 00:51:27.194]  We're good to go.
[00:51:55.111 --> 00:52:02.435]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:02.435 --> 00:52:07.818]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[00:52:07.818 --> 00:52:10.240]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:17.323]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by
[00:52:18.404 --> 00:52:19.725]  I'm calling the Bailout Group.
[00:52:19.725 --> 00:52:26.790]  This program has already settled over $100 million of debt and are saving individual consumers thousands of dollars.
[00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:33.114]  Folks, if you are struggling with credit card debt and those excessive interest payments, the time is now to take advantage of this opportunity.
[00:52:33.114 --> 00:52:37.057]  Call the Bailout Group today at 1-800-324-6554.
[00:52:37.057 --> 00:52:39.859]  I hope our listeners take advantage of this.
[00:52:39.859 --> 00:52:45.442]  The call is free and in 10 minutes they will show you how much you can save right over the phone with one simple call.
[00:52:45.442 --> 00:52:47.564]  Let the Bailout Group bail you out of debt.
[00:52:47.944 --> 00:52:49.706]  This is Alex Jones for American Tax Settlement.
[00:52:49.706 --> 00:52:56.372]  We have received news the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements on back taxes and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of dollars.
[00:53:12.626 --> 00:53:20.655]  If any of you out there owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, we have created an open phone line with American Tax Settlement.
[00:53:20.655 --> 00:53:26.602]  For all Alex Jones listeners to see if you qualify for a settlement with the IRS to save thousands, the number to call is 1-800.
[00:53:28.224 --> 00:53:30.045]  506-5904.
[00:53:30.045 --> 00:53:35.089]  Millions of taxpayers now may be eligible for this settlement to save thousands of dollars.
[00:53:35.089 --> 00:53:39.973]  Don't risk the IRS coming after you and garnishing your wages or seizing your property.
[00:53:39.973 --> 00:53:49.060]  American Tax Settlement specializes in negotiating with the IRS on your behalf, keeping the IRS off your back, and saving consumers millions of dollars.
[00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:53.204]  If you owe $10,000 or more in taxes to the IRS, the number to call is 1-800-506-5904.
[00:53:56.406 --> 00:53:58.967]  The average person would watch that CNN report
[00:54:27.995 --> 00:54:33.620]  See, oh look, CNN, New York, National Media.
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:41.927]  They're looking out for us against the Boss Hogg, Backwards, Knuckle Dragon Texans.
[00:54:41.927 --> 00:54:48.973]  When that stuff goes on all over the country, but they do it on Texas every single week.
[00:54:48.973 --> 00:54:49.734]  And it is true.
[00:54:51.724 --> 00:55:01.046]  The police in Oklahoma, Texas, other southern and western cities literally are treated like God.
[00:55:01.046 --> 00:55:05.867]  The public is nice and friendly and puts up with anything.
[00:55:05.867 --> 00:55:08.208]  And so the cops start thinking it's normal.
[00:55:08.208 --> 00:55:14.629]  They will go on TV and say, we took the old woman's $4,000 and I spent it on my house.
[00:55:14.629 --> 00:55:15.609]  What's wrong with that?
[00:55:15.609 --> 00:55:19.390]  I'm a DA and I'm allowed to have a little money.
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:24.243]  Honey!
[00:55:24.243 --> 00:55:29.427]  People around here voted me in because I share the money with all of them.
[00:55:29.427 --> 00:55:32.269]  You don't come through our town now, boy.
[00:55:32.269 --> 00:55:33.870]  Sure, that's going on.
[00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:41.076]  But that expression of government out of control is going on on a bigger scale at the federal level.
[00:55:41.076 --> 00:55:45.580]  They're not stealing people's wallets, they're stealing their entire future.
[00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:47.081]  They're stealing GM and Chrysler.
[00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:58.118]  Now, the feds encouraged in the 80s the passage of federal laws for asset forfeiture seizure.
[00:55:58.118 --> 00:56:04.547]  The states would never allow previously the police to just grab your car or house without even charging you.
[00:56:04.547 --> 00:56:05.548]  No drugs are found!
[00:56:06.329 --> 00:56:09.450]  All over Florida, Texas, California are some of the worst.
[00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:18.454]  There's famous cases of where counties in California would want to buy somebody's hundred acres of beautiful canyon land worth tens of millions, family land.
[00:56:18.454 --> 00:56:19.435]  They wouldn't sell it.
[00:56:19.435 --> 00:56:22.336]  Police would just come gun the family down.
[00:56:22.336 --> 00:56:23.636]  I could list all those cases.
[00:56:23.636 --> 00:56:27.158]  In fact, Matt as hell actually covers it, the Aaron Russo film we carry.
[00:56:27.158 --> 00:56:31.660]  One case, they just came to his house and shot him right in the back and the cops moved into it and sold it for themselves.
[00:56:34.087 --> 00:56:38.068]  And there are corrupt counties in Texas where they will murder you for your land.
[00:56:38.068 --> 00:56:50.770]  Nice families will move into an area and the locals will come by and stop at the mailbox and go, you better sell me this land for one penny on the dollar or something bad is going to happen.
[00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:55.411]  You don't sell and they start pulling you over, start beating you up, burn your place down.
[00:56:55.411 --> 00:56:56.291]  They'll gun you down.
[00:56:56.291 --> 00:57:02.612]  Because they've been doing it for generations and nobody's going to stand up to them because we're a nation of cowards.
[00:57:05.765 --> 00:57:06.886]  And that's what the Feds do.
[00:57:06.886 --> 00:57:13.269]  The Feds wrote the Asset Forfeiture Seizure, and then the states adopt it through federal jurisdiction.
[00:57:13.269 --> 00:57:25.735]  If the states seize your land or money under a federal operation, in a federal joint JTF, Joint Task Force, they get to keep 85% of the money.
[00:57:25.735 --> 00:57:28.736]  If they do it at the state, they only get to keep 25% under state law.
[00:57:28.736 --> 00:57:32.018]  So C. Anderson was telling you about the state seizures,
[00:57:33.322 --> 00:57:36.044]  Which don't hold a candle to the feds that started it all.
[00:57:36.044 --> 00:57:51.195]  The Central Intelligence Agency you work for, Anderson, that ships the cocaine and heroin in here, works for the same federal government that started all of this, you little tromp!
[00:57:51.195 --> 00:57:56.859]  And you know it, and I know it, punk!
[00:57:56.859 --> 00:58:01.463]  So shame on you acting like this is all a hillbilly operation.
[00:58:01.463 --> 00:58:02.564]  These hillbillies are about a
[00:58:04.306 --> 00:58:10.909]  Inch high to a grasshopper compared to you.
[00:58:10.909 --> 00:58:13.970]  You big ol' fat parasite.
[00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:18.451]  Drunk on the blood of the innocents.
[00:58:18.451 --> 00:58:23.173]  Let's see, the big parasites like to show the public the little parasites.
[00:58:23.173 --> 00:58:26.455]  Keep you busy with them.
[00:58:26.455 --> 00:58:29.836]  When we get back, I'm gonna get into what's happening with GM.
[00:58:32.082 --> 00:58:36.166]  And Chrysler, you know, they wouldn't go along with it, so the White House hijacked private companies.
[00:58:36.166 --> 00:58:37.507]  It's totally illegal.
[00:58:37.507 --> 00:58:38.829]  And what's happening right now?
[00:58:38.829 --> 00:58:42.392]  Big news.
[00:58:42.392 --> 00:58:43.814]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.759 --> 00:58:52.440]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:57.184]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:57.184 --> 00:59:00.146]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:00.146 --> 00:59:03.208]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:03.208 --> 00:59:09.273]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:59:09.273 --> 00:59:12.515]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:12.515 --> 00:59:19.420]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[00:59:53.544 --> 00:59:55.926]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.926 --> 01:00:05.233]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.233 --> 01:00:06.534]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.534 --> 01:00:08.316]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.316 --> 01:00:10.057]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.057 --> 01:00:11.638]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.638 --> 01:00:13.199]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.199 --> 01:00:17.383]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.383 --> 01:00:21.466]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:36.576 --> 01:00:44.721]  There's a new satirical movie coming out, put out by NBC, making fun of sitcoms.
[01:00:44.721 --> 01:00:45.802]  But it's really a psyop.
[01:00:45.802 --> 01:00:46.803]  It's not making fun of them.
[01:00:46.803 --> 01:00:48.944]  This is exactly what they're like.
[01:00:48.944 --> 01:00:51.186]  But it took the satire to really let me see
[01:00:52.756 --> 01:00:58.658]  From the few sitcoms, the modern sitcoms I've witnessed, how they've dumbed everything down.
[01:00:58.658 --> 01:01:03.099]  That is coming up and I want to discuss the chemicalization, the overall dumbing down of the public.
[01:01:03.099 --> 01:01:08.281]  Because as stupid as these characters sound, that's what the young people are like.
[01:01:08.281 --> 01:01:12.402]  You try to talk to them, they are about as smart as my dog.
[01:01:15.973 --> 01:01:16.853]  So that's coming up.
[01:01:16.853 --> 01:01:21.595]  Also, what's happening in Iran, what's happening with North Korea, all extremely important.
[01:01:21.595 --> 01:01:25.136]  Open phones later in the hour and we're going to have David Icahn for two hours today.
[01:01:25.136 --> 01:01:32.258]  That's always informative and interesting to get his perspective.
[01:01:32.258 --> 01:01:33.898]  Also, two interesting articles.
[01:01:33.898 --> 01:01:39.140]  CNN, I've been telling you this for years, American Al Qaeda member acknowledges Jewish ancestry.
[01:01:40.652 --> 01:01:44.155]  Adam Gadon, also known as Azeem the American.
[01:01:44.155 --> 01:01:47.257]  Yeah, that's really what the Muslims call him, Azeem the American.
[01:01:47.257 --> 01:01:48.718]  They're always like Chemical Ali.
[01:01:48.718 --> 01:01:51.140]  Oh, Americans don't know who the boogeyman in Iraq.
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:53.922]  Give them, like, comic book names like Chemical Ali.
[01:01:53.922 --> 01:01:55.904]  Their little feeble brains can get that.
[01:01:55.904 --> 01:01:58.966]  I mean, how stupid do you like being treated?
[01:02:00.543 --> 01:02:03.245]  He's the grandson of the former head of the ADL.
[01:02:03.245 --> 01:02:06.327]  He got arrested repeatedly for beating up Muslims outside mosques.
[01:02:06.327 --> 01:02:08.208]  I mean, he hates Muslims that much.
[01:02:08.208 --> 01:02:09.508]  Rabid Zionist.
[01:02:09.508 --> 01:02:12.230]  And then he becomes the head of Al-Qaeda.
[01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:20.255]  And then the Intel Center gets caught uploading his videos with the Al-Qaeda watermark in the same video layer as the Intel Center.
[01:02:20.255 --> 01:02:25.498]  And the Intel Center is publicly run by CIA former psych warfare experts under Rumsfeld.
[01:02:25.498 --> 01:02:26.299]  Publicly!
[01:02:26.299 --> 01:02:27.439]  The CIA!
[01:02:27.439 --> 01:02:28.140]  Publicly!
[01:02:29.113 --> 01:02:33.954]  This guy's probably in Miami!
[01:02:33.954 --> 01:02:35.695]  But the public loves it!
[01:02:35.695 --> 01:02:48.218]  They hate foreigners and so they'll don't understand the whole anti-terror apparatuses for them.
[01:02:48.218 --> 01:02:50.719]  But I guess CNN's anti-semitic for getting into that.
[01:02:50.719 --> 01:02:54.160]  Well no, they're just spinning it because it's now popular knowledge out there.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.681]  So I'll look into that later.
[01:02:55.681 --> 01:02:57.061]  Also an article by Ezra
[01:02:58.288 --> 01:03:02.972]  Levant, Levant, who's Jewish himself.
[01:03:02.972 --> 01:03:07.757]  This is in the Ottawa Citizen, that's in the capital of Canada.
[01:03:07.757 --> 01:03:11.440]  Big paper there.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:18.267]  And it says in 65 and 66, the Canadian Jewish Congress helped organize the fledgling Canadian Nazi Party.
[01:03:18.267 --> 01:03:20.309]  That's why I'm attacked by the Nazis and the ADL.
[01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:22.091]  I don't like any of you guys.
[01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:31.433]  That sounds crazy, but it's true, and I wrote about it in Shakedown, my new book about Canada's Human Rights Commissions, which are meant to take everybody's free speech.
[01:03:31.433 --> 01:03:33.695]  So, it's the same thing.
[01:03:34.727 --> 01:03:41.573]  It's been in the London Guardian that the major Nazi groups are run, not infiltrated, run and founded.
[01:03:41.573 --> 01:03:42.634]  Founded and run.
[01:03:42.634 --> 01:03:46.557]  And the major Klan groups are founded and run by the FBI.
[01:03:46.557 --> 01:03:50.160]  And McVeigh was run out of Ellingham City by the Southern Property Law Center.
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:53.543]  That came out in declassified FBI documents.
[01:03:53.543 --> 01:04:02.851]  Curt Nemo posted this article but also did a blurb above it and added that, added the declassified FBI document up there.
[01:04:04.804 --> 01:04:16.012]  What happened is the FBI blacked one out in a lawsuit, and in another lawsuit they blacked out another part, but with the two letters it was put together and you could see basically the whole article.
[01:04:16.012 --> 01:04:16.933]  Oh, got caught!
[01:04:18.709 --> 01:04:20.790]  Hey, Southern Poverty Law Center!
[01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:27.934]  You gotta have terrorists blowing up federal buildings, or you can't send out intelligence reports to all the professional people.
[01:04:27.934 --> 01:04:30.875]  You're a doctor or lawyer, you get their stupid intelligence report.
[01:04:30.875 --> 01:04:34.957]  Give up all your rights, get rid of free speech, or the Nazis will get us!
[01:04:34.957 --> 01:04:36.718]  Oh yeah!
[01:04:36.718 --> 01:04:37.819]  They'll get us!
[01:04:37.819 --> 01:04:40.560]  Big, mean, scary Nazis!
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.321]  Big, scary fangs!
[01:04:42.321 --> 01:04:43.702]  Bite, bite, snap, snap!
[01:04:47.102 --> 01:04:50.227]  And people wonder why I don't embrace the Nazis.
[01:04:50.227 --> 01:04:54.274]  I'm not going to embrace the ADL and Southern Providence Law Center.
[01:04:54.274 --> 01:04:57.739]  Or the real racists that are out there as well for all the tea in China.
[01:04:57.739 --> 01:04:59.261]  Got that, you big fat feds?
[01:05:00.885 --> 01:05:06.728]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from the resistant new strains of deadly bacteria and viruses?

[01:06:00.517 --> 01:06:09.623]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[01:06:09.623 --> 01:06:14.786]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[01:06:14.786 --> 01:06:17.368]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals
[01:06:17.768 --> 01:06:19.829]  Actually results in disease.

[01:07:18.683 --> 01:07:22.884]  And clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[01:07:22.884 --> 01:07:25.644]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.

[01:07:57.334 --> 01:07:59.435]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:59.435 --> 01:08:02.997]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.202 --> 01:08:12.163]  Alright, huge news blitz coming up.
[01:08:12.163 --> 01:08:16.726]  I'm going to break down what's happening with GM and Chrysler.
[01:08:16.726 --> 01:08:18.987]  I told you they're breaking them up in pieces.
[01:08:18.987 --> 01:08:25.451]  I mean, piling money on top of it, a bailout money, and giving it to foreign corporations.
[01:08:25.451 --> 01:08:27.673]  I mean, just absolute robbery.
[01:08:27.673 --> 01:08:31.695]  You are paying taxes to lose the company.
[01:08:31.695 --> 01:08:33.216]  Not paying taxes to prop it up.
[01:08:36.542 --> 01:08:39.963]  So just crime on top of crime at levels never before seen.
[01:08:39.963 --> 01:08:44.024]  That is coming up.
[01:08:44.024 --> 01:08:50.065]  I want to get more into the CNN headline, American Al Qaeda member acknowledges Jewish ancestry.
[01:08:50.065 --> 01:08:59.947]  And then one out of the Ottawa Citizen, big paper in Canada, creating anti-Semitism since 1965.
[01:08:59.947 --> 01:09:05.308]  Canadian Jewish Congress, run by the Brothmans, organized the fledgling Canadian Nazi Party.
[01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:06.128]  Totally staged.
[01:09:09.468 --> 01:09:13.591]  And I've been out to Nazi rallies to protest them in Austin.
[01:09:13.591 --> 01:09:15.353]  We've shot video of it and showed it on TV.
[01:09:15.353 --> 01:09:18.035]  And folks, they're not Nazis.
[01:09:18.035 --> 01:09:24.700]  And as far as there's a genetic type, and we ought to dig those videos out and show it, they were Jewish folks here in Austin.
[01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:25.881]  I mean, facts are facts.
[01:09:25.881 --> 01:09:29.564]  And it's being used to ban free speech and liberty in America.
[01:09:29.564 --> 01:09:32.807]  And it's terrible and it's horrible, but it's in the mainstream news.
[01:09:35.069 --> 01:09:37.271]  This is what false flag terrorism is.
[01:09:37.271 --> 01:09:39.272]  Are there real Nazis, real white supremacists?
[01:09:39.272 --> 01:09:41.334]  Yes.
[01:09:41.334 --> 01:09:44.296]  But now you wonder why I say, was Von Brun under mind control?
[01:09:44.296 --> 01:09:49.940]  He was under federal custody for six years.
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:51.301]  In the 80s.
[01:09:51.301 --> 01:09:56.104]  With a crazy box thing with fake dynamite and a gun that sounds fake.
[01:09:56.104 --> 01:09:58.006]  Then he pops back up and shoots this guard.
[01:09:58.006 --> 01:09:59.527]  Now he could be a real crazy.
[01:10:00.834 --> 01:10:03.915]  But the issue here is, you wonder why I say this could be an op?
[01:10:03.915 --> 01:10:08.096]  Look at the timing with the Federal Reserve about to be audited.
[01:10:08.096 --> 01:10:15.439]  And the government wants to tar and feather the anti-Federal Reserve movement as anti-Semitic when it has nothing to do with that.
[01:10:15.439 --> 01:10:16.639]  And they desperately want to do it.
[01:10:16.639 --> 01:10:23.822]  And they always have the Nazis sicked on me because I don't make it about religion or race.
[01:10:23.822 --> 01:10:27.863]  And I know some of the groups that have been sicked on me are feds and it's come out they are feds.
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:33.921]  It's come out in the Orlando newspaper, the big Nazi rallies they have there were run by Feds.
[01:10:33.921 --> 01:10:38.363]  I mean, German Nazis are started and run by Feds, the modern ones, and the British.
[01:10:38.363 --> 01:10:39.563]  I'm going to break this down later.
[01:10:39.563 --> 01:10:43.184]  We'll talk about it with David Icke.
[01:10:43.184 --> 01:10:48.546]  But who gets caught in the middle?
[01:10:48.546 --> 01:10:49.746]  Americans of all stripes.
[01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:54.928]  Japanese, Anglo-Saxon, Jewish.
[01:10:54.928 --> 01:10:55.528]  It's very sick.
[01:10:57.655 --> 01:10:59.455]  Listen, I have a new sponsor I wanted to tell you about.
[01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:11.498]  I'm going to have him up for an interview, not because he's a sponsor, but because everybody I always talk to, police, military, Joe Bannister was in here wearing a Front Sight t-shirt the other day.
[01:11:11.498 --> 01:11:13.298]  He said, oh, you're wearing a suit, should I put a suit on?
[01:11:13.298 --> 01:11:20.679]  He went and changed into a suit, but then he brought the Front Sight t-shirt and showed it before he even knew I'd just been contacted by the owner of Front Sight.
[01:11:20.679 --> 01:11:24.220]  This is reportedly the best and the most inexpensive
[01:11:29.409 --> 01:11:38.236]  Training out there, and I know a bunch of shooters, people that are obsessed with shooting competitions and things, and I've been in them years ago, more than a decade ago.
[01:11:38.236 --> 01:11:39.597]  Never been to Front Sight.
[01:11:39.597 --> 01:11:47.704]  But they supposedly are the best, and they've got an offer here for our listeners.
[01:11:47.704 --> 01:11:51.907]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot, Dr. Ignatius Piazza?
[01:11:51.907 --> 01:11:58.613]  The founder of the Front Sight Firearms Training Institute is offering a free handgun and five days of firearms training to my listeners.
[01:12:00.353 --> 01:12:06.738]  This offer is only available for a limited time because Dr. Piazza is literally paying his own money out of pocket to be able to offer you this deal.
[01:12:06.738 --> 01:12:07.919]  It won't last forever, so listen up.
[01:12:07.919 --> 01:12:18.128]  You're going to attend five days of world-class gun training at the Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-stake concealed weapon permit for pennies on the dollar.
[01:12:18.128 --> 01:12:25.053]  Act fast and they will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:12:25.053 --> 01:12:27.575]  I believe now is the time for you and your family to be armed

[01:13:14.637 --> 01:13:17.900]  There's a 10% chance of that happening, and it's a lot bigger than that.
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:21.743]  You should have storable foods, and this is the non-GMO, non-hybrid place to go.

[01:13:48.803 --> 01:13:52.705]  Okay, let me now hurry through all the rest of the news and information here.
[01:13:52.705 --> 01:14:00.971]  I'm going to play this clip first, and then I'm going to break down the full
[01:14:02.597 --> 01:14:04.238]  Magnitude.
[01:14:04.238 --> 01:14:05.899]  Or at least closer to the full magnitude.
[01:14:05.899 --> 01:14:10.243]  I mean, the corruption is so incredible it's even hard to describe.
[01:14:10.243 --> 01:14:12.544]  And what she's saying is what we've been talking about for months.
[01:14:12.544 --> 01:14:23.172]  They planned three years ago that we knew of to hijack Chrysler and give it to Bilderberg Group-owned Fiat, to hijack GM.
[01:14:23.172 --> 01:14:25.434]  As GM goes, so goes the nation, and hand it over.
[01:14:29.155 --> 01:14:32.316]  To the Brazilians, the Russians, the Europeans and the Chinese.
[01:14:32.316 --> 01:14:46.300]  All the divisions that made money are being handed over to new private corporate owners and they're being paid billions of dollars apiece to take it.
[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:55.163]  And you understand that even under global law that we've signed on to criminally in the World Trade Organization, they can't use the economic stimulus money or bailout money exclusively in the U.S.
[01:14:56.164 --> 01:14:59.287]  So, the argument is, well, you know, the U.S.
[01:14:59.287 --> 01:15:06.953]  per capita is only a small part of the world, 5% of the world population, so the majority of the money, the bailout money, has to be spent outside the U.S.
[01:15:06.953 --> 01:15:14.640]  They're not even allowed to use the bailout money and stimulus money domestically on only domestic projects.
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:17.442]  That's the New World Order, just like the $14.8 trillion
[01:15:19.366 --> 01:15:29.239]  To go hedge all the markets, drive up commodities, and then you pay more in a tax to the bankers as a commodity, and you pay to speculate and run up the price.
[01:15:29.239 --> 01:15:31.882]  You see, it's all about imploding society.
[01:15:31.882 --> 01:15:33.244]  It's risk.
[01:15:33.244 --> 01:15:34.987]  Clearing off all the other board pieces.
[01:15:36.459 --> 01:15:37.540]  This is a game of chess, folks.
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:39.020]  We're being wiped out here.
[01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:39.901]  These people aren't nice.
[01:15:39.901 --> 01:15:41.101]  That's why they're in control.
[01:15:41.101 --> 01:15:44.003]  So stop sucking your thumb and living in la-la land.
[01:15:44.003 --> 01:15:48.885]  They're gonna steal everything that is even nailed down, including the kitchen sink.
[01:15:48.885 --> 01:15:50.286]  Everything!
[01:15:50.286 --> 01:15:58.910]  They will implode everything, and the fact you lay there being fooled by Obama and fooled by the Republicans only encourages them.
[01:15:58.910 --> 01:16:03.272]  This is economic warfare, backed up by paramilitary force.
[01:16:06.704 --> 01:16:14.692]  I mean, if nobody can stop Texas and Alabama and Florida and Michigan cops randomly pulling over families and stealing their wallets...
[01:16:15.964 --> 01:16:22.146]  They're not going to be able to stop the bankers robbing everything until you get up off your fat butts and stop thinking that everything's okay.
[01:16:22.146 --> 01:16:26.947]  I'm not talking to our general audience, but all the new stations picking us up and everybody tuning in.
[01:16:26.947 --> 01:16:27.928]  Listen to me!
[01:16:27.928 --> 01:16:32.929]  I'm telling you the truth, and you know it in your gut already, and you know it intellectually!
[01:16:32.929 --> 01:16:35.170]  We're not in Kansas anymore!
[01:16:35.170 --> 01:16:39.251]  So get ready to go down the rabbit hole here, or we don't have a prayer!
[01:16:39.251 --> 01:16:40.652]  Now let's play Representative Michelle
[01:16:41.772 --> 01:16:44.754]  Bachman breaking it down and what she's saying is on record.
[01:16:44.754 --> 01:16:46.154]  This is mafia government.
[01:16:46.154 --> 01:16:47.115]  Here it is.
[01:16:47.115 --> 01:16:48.996]  So that they could stay open.
[01:16:48.996 --> 01:16:54.759]  That senator was able to arrange a meeting between the dealer and the officials at GM.
[01:16:54.759 --> 01:16:56.080]  You know, we got more time today.
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:57.321]  Back all the way to the start.
[01:16:57.321 --> 01:16:58.221]  Back all the way to the start.
[01:16:58.221 --> 01:17:00.022]  I know I, yesterday had you play it from there.
[01:17:00.022 --> 01:17:00.843]  Play it from the start.
[01:17:00.843 --> 01:17:01.123]  Here it is.
[01:17:02.935 --> 01:17:09.140]  I thank the gentleman from Missouri, and I'm very concerned again about these motor takeovers from the federal government.
[01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:19.529]  One thing that I'm very concerned about, a story came out today where there's been approximately 1,500 letters, I believe, that have gone out to GM dealerships.
[01:17:19.529 --> 01:17:25.394]  One story that came out today, there's a dealership that I know of that applied to their Democrat senator
[01:17:26.095 --> 01:17:30.018]  To appeal for help so that they could stay open.
[01:17:30.018 --> 01:17:36.181]  That senator was able to arrange a meeting between the dealer and the officials at GM.
[01:17:36.181 --> 01:17:40.144]  We all know GM is now Government Motors because it's owned by the American people.
[01:17:40.144 --> 01:17:41.385]  It's been nationalized.
[01:17:41.385 --> 01:17:45.607]  There's no private corporation the way we used to think of GM.
[01:17:45.607 --> 01:17:47.809]  Now the main stockholder is the American government.
[01:17:48.129 --> 01:17:58.992]  So this Democrat Senator, who was applied to for help, was able to secure a meeting with General Motors and a car dealership, and they were able to get their dealership back.
[01:17:58.992 --> 01:17:59.873]  Well, that's great.
[01:17:59.873 --> 01:18:00.813]  That's wonderful.
[01:18:00.813 --> 01:18:11.076]  There's also another article I saw today where a constituent had contacted one of the representatives, a Democrat representative, here in this chamber, Representative Barney Frank.
[01:18:11.576 --> 01:18:17.017]  Barney Frank was able to go and talk to the right people and get this dealership back open.
[01:18:17.017 --> 01:18:20.598]  Is that what we have come to in this country?
[01:18:20.598 --> 01:18:37.561]  That rather than a private business with a private contract with another private corporation, they're no longer able to work out their agreements because as columnist Michael Barone has called, he said, now we've moved into the realm of gangster government
[01:18:38.001 --> 01:18:59.287]  We have gangster government when the federal government has set up a new cartel and private businesses now have to go begging with their handout to their local, hopefully well politically connected, congressman or their senator so they can buy a peace offering for that local business.
[01:18:59.887 --> 01:19:03.570]  Is that the kind of country we're going to have in the future?
[01:19:03.570 --> 01:19:11.416]  When I was on the phone today, for over an hour, with one of my local dealers, the very first thing out of her mouth was this.
[01:19:11.416 --> 01:19:16.000]  She said, this is the most un-American thing I have ever seen in my life.
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:46.040]  I can't believe that I lived to see the day that my country would come to this point, where having my dealership for 90 years, I get a letter FedExed to me that tells me I have until Friday to sign this document to not only give up my company that was made worthless, worth $15 million, made worthless overnight, now GM is demanding that she hand over the customer list.
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:48.982]  They're doing it because they know we don't have any guts.
[01:19:48.982 --> 01:19:50.183]  They know we've capitulated.
[01:19:50.183 --> 01:19:51.264]  We've rolled over.
[01:19:51.264 --> 01:19:53.106]  We're not tough, folks.
[01:19:53.106 --> 01:19:54.046]  We're cowards.
[01:19:54.046 --> 01:19:55.848]  We've got to get our manhood back.
[01:19:55.848 --> 01:20:01.112]  I'll explain it and finish the clip on the other side.
[01:20:01.112 --> 01:20:07.357]  How would you like to cook any meal using no electricity or gas and cook your meals off the grid?
[01:20:07.357 --> 01:20:09.979]  Well, now you can, thanks to the Survival Oven.

[01:21:02.775 --> 01:21:05.596]  A new world order.
[01:21:05.596 --> 01:21:09.857]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:21:10.481 --> 01:21:13.303]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:21:13.303 --> 01:21:16.086]  Both their objective being world domination.
[01:21:16.086 --> 01:21:19.268]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:21:19.268 --> 01:21:26.595]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:21:29.628 --> 01:21:35.072]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:21:35.072 --> 01:21:38.934]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:21:38.934 --> 01:21:41.516]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:21:41.516 --> 01:21:42.677]  Most people have no idea.
[01:21:42.677 --> 01:21:43.457]  They're not after money.
[01:21:43.457 --> 01:21:44.738]  They have all the money they need.
[01:21:44.738 --> 01:21:45.719]  They're after power.
[01:21:45.719 --> 01:21:46.860]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:21:56.346 --> 01:21:58.387]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:21:58.387 --> 01:21:59.448]  You have been warned.
[01:21:59.568 --> 01:22:03.271]  Hi, I'm John Swenson at Midas Resources.
[01:22:03.271 --> 01:22:07.414]  800-686-2237, extension 128.
[01:22:07.414 --> 01:22:09.536]  And let's take in a brief mind movie.
[01:22:09.536 --> 01:22:15.220]  We're surrounded by Jesters, members of the nation's largest clown club based in Washington, D.C.
[01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:21.025]  Fuzzy hair, baggy pants, big yellow shoes, and now offering financial assurances that all will be well.
[01:22:21.025 --> 01:22:23.046]  The stimulus package is working.
[01:22:23.046 --> 01:22:24.928]  A bailout is coming your way.
[01:22:24.928 --> 01:22:28.791]  And while we're flat broke, we're also told that we've stepped back away from the brink.
[01:22:29.090 --> 01:22:30.251]  Pardon me?
[01:22:30.251 --> 01:22:31.492]  Back to the real world.
[01:22:31.492 --> 01:22:35.754]  We know that we can rely on no one but ourselves to generate financial security.
[01:22:35.754 --> 01:22:38.316]  Protecting your assets is solely up to you.
[01:22:38.316 --> 01:22:40.017]  No one else is coming to the rescue.
[01:22:40.017 --> 01:22:51.484]  Please call me, John Swenson, 800-686-2237, extension 128, to discuss investing in precious metals, gold and silver, with a 6,000 year track record of success and security.

[01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:06.412]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[01:23:06.412 --> 01:23:07.172]  Think about that.
[01:23:07.172 --> 01:23:10.293]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[01:23:10.293 --> 01:23:13.493]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[01:23:13.493 --> 01:23:23.296]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Chews for Health, a delicious tasting, chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables, and antioxidants.

[01:23:29.577 --> 01:23:30.738]  The choice is yours.

[01:23:53.729 --> 01:23:54.249]  Watch me!
[01:23:54.249 --> 01:23:56.571]  Watch me steal everything you got!
[01:24:12.242 --> 01:24:13.563]  Yeah!
[01:24:13.563 --> 01:24:16.125]  Alright!
[01:24:16.125 --> 01:24:17.526]  Woo!
[01:24:17.526 --> 01:24:19.187]  Yeah!
[01:24:19.187 --> 01:24:19.908]  Ha ha!
[01:24:19.908 --> 01:24:23.531]  Gonna take everything you got, baby, yeah!
[01:24:23.531 --> 01:24:24.331]  Ha ha!
[01:24:24.331 --> 01:24:25.092]  Ha ha ha!
[01:24:25.092 --> 01:24:26.593]  I feel good!
[01:24:33.817 --> 01:24:36.959]  Coming to America!
[01:24:36.959 --> 01:24:40.801]  Gonna rip you off!
[01:24:40.801 --> 01:24:45.764]  Where the police beat up ambulance drivers for no reason.
[01:24:45.764 --> 01:24:52.808]  Where the IRS take your money and not tell you where it goes.
[01:24:52.808 --> 01:24:53.528]  Oh yeah!
[01:24:53.528 --> 01:24:55.970]  Ha ha!
[01:24:55.970 --> 01:24:59.212]  Gonna take GM, gonna give it to my friends.
[01:25:00.219 --> 01:25:02.871]  Because I'm a gangster in chief, baby, yeah!
[01:25:07.578 --> 01:25:13.580]  And I don't need no one else.
[01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:15.541]  Sometimes I feel so nice.
[01:25:15.541 --> 01:25:18.982]  When we have 50 million abortions.
[01:25:18.982 --> 01:25:24.763]  And the stupid people don't even know it's a baby.
[01:25:24.763 --> 01:25:26.884]  These suckers is ready.
[01:25:26.884 --> 01:25:28.485]  So let's rape them good.
[01:25:28.485 --> 01:25:30.945]  Feeling good baby.
[01:25:42.842 --> 01:25:46.324]  Rape them good, up and down, side to side.
[01:25:46.324 --> 01:25:48.205]  Take it all, baby girl.
[01:25:48.205 --> 01:25:52.068]  I'm ready, ready, ready, ready, ready to take it all.
[01:25:52.068 --> 01:26:02.935]  So come on baby, and get ready, cause daddy's coming to town.
[01:26:02.935 --> 01:26:05.477]  You like abuse baby, I'm gonna give it to ya.
[01:26:07.494 --> 01:26:09.516]  You want daddy to hurt you real good?
[01:26:09.516 --> 01:26:10.598]  Well, get ready.
[01:26:10.598 --> 01:26:19.470]  How about I break your nose and knock your teeth out, bitch?
[01:26:19.470 --> 01:26:21.814]  You like SWAT teams and cameras?
[01:26:21.814 --> 01:26:23.116]  You my ho now!
[01:26:25.936 --> 01:26:28.397]  It's the American bitch.
[01:26:28.397 --> 01:26:30.438]  I drag her by the hair.
[01:26:30.438 --> 01:26:34.721]  She begs me to, begs me to take it easy.
[01:26:34.721 --> 01:26:38.683]  And that's when I put cigarettes out on her eyes.
[01:26:38.683 --> 01:26:41.364]  And she thinks me old.
[01:26:41.364 --> 01:26:43.745]  She says, keep doing it baby, yeah.
[01:26:43.745 --> 01:26:44.986]  I got that thing.
[01:26:44.986 --> 01:26:47.887]  Tell me what it's all about.
[01:26:47.887 --> 01:26:48.788]  I got soul.
[01:26:55.965 --> 01:27:09.897]  But I tell ya, I got a big problem here, baby.
[01:27:09.897 --> 01:27:13.160]  There's this one girl, Representative Michelle Bachman.
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:15.763]  That's why I got to control media going after her every day.
[01:27:15.763 --> 01:27:17.324]  Problem is how stupid she is.
[01:27:17.324 --> 01:27:19.466]  I'm a little bit scared of this bitch.
[01:27:19.466 --> 01:27:21.608]  She ain't doing what I tell her!
[01:27:21.608 --> 01:27:22.569]  Let's go ahead and play her!
[01:27:23.752 --> 01:27:25.753]  Maybe I'll send the IRS over to her house.
[01:27:25.753 --> 01:27:28.995]  Here she is talking about what I'm doing with the company.
[01:27:28.995 --> 01:27:30.556]  Here it is.
[01:27:30.556 --> 01:27:38.400]  When I was on the phone today for over an hour with one of my local dealers, the very first thing out of her mouth was this.
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:40.821]  She said this is the most un-American thing
[01:27:41.241 --> 01:27:43.422]  I have ever seen in my life.
[01:27:43.422 --> 01:28:09.315]  I can't believe that I lived to see the day that my country would come to this point where having my dealership for 90 years, I get a letter FedExed to me that tells me I have until Friday to sign this document to not only give up my company that was made worthless, worth 15 million dollars, made worthless overnight, now GM is demanding
[01:28:09.915 --> 01:28:16.617]  That she hand over her customer list, her service customer list to GM.
[01:28:16.617 --> 01:28:17.598]  Why?
[01:28:17.598 --> 01:28:20.939]  GM most likely will use those customer lists.
[01:28:20.939 --> 01:28:23.600]  They'll give it to her former competitors.
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:26.001]  That's how it works, baby!
[01:28:26.001 --> 01:28:28.201]  What's her remuneration?
[01:28:28.201 --> 01:28:31.743]  She had the rug pulled out from her and from her husband.
[01:28:31.743 --> 01:28:35.004]  They virtually lost everything overnight.
[01:28:35.004 --> 01:28:35.424]  To what?
[01:28:36.601 --> 01:28:41.325]  To what Michael Barone calls a gangster government.
[01:28:41.325 --> 01:28:44.607]  We need to call this for what this is, my colleague.
[01:28:44.607 --> 01:28:46.869]  We need to call this for what this is.
[01:28:46.869 --> 01:28:47.810]  Call it out.
[01:28:47.810 --> 01:28:54.495]  The American people need to get outraged and figure out that it could be them next.
[01:28:54.495 --> 01:28:56.437]  But you know you like gangsters, baby.
[01:28:56.437 --> 01:28:57.678]  You like the bad boys.
[01:28:57.678 --> 01:29:03.703]  The administration appoints czars, car czars, wage czars.
[01:29:03.703 --> 01:29:06.105]  There's over 20 czars that have been appointed.
[01:29:06.345 --> 01:29:10.567]  Come here Congresswoman, I'm gonna shoot you up with some mercury.
[01:29:10.567 --> 01:29:12.428]  That'll make you shut your mouth.
[01:29:12.428 --> 01:29:14.729]  We've been bypassed.
[01:29:14.729 --> 01:29:20.792]  We now have an imperial presidency where the president has appointed various czars.
[01:29:20.792 --> 01:29:23.434]  Drink your fluoride and shut up lady!
[01:29:23.434 --> 01:29:31.398]  Reaching into the confines of private businesses and overnight rendering them virtually worthless unless
[01:29:32.558 --> 01:29:38.679]  Unless they have a special tug, a political tie, to a local Democrat Congressman.
[01:29:38.679 --> 01:29:39.299]  That's how we roll.
[01:29:39.299 --> 01:29:40.620]  Is that what we've come to?
[01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:42.120]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:45.200]  Sorry, I got a bit racy there with the satire, but it's not satire.
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:51.202]  We're being raped by the Gangsta-in-Chief, baby!
[01:29:51.202 --> 01:29:52.602]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.602 --> 01:29:55.122]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.122 --> 01:29:57.823]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.317 --> 01:30:04.698]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:30:04.698 --> 01:30:08.600]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:14.202]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride, at less than 2 cents per gallon?
[01:30:14.202 --> 01:30:19.084]  Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride,
[01:30:22.722 --> 01:30:22.982]  I think so.
[01:30:45.573 --> 01:30:49.435]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:30:49.435 --> 01:30:54.337]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:31:14.944 --> 01:31:21.150]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:21.150 --> 01:31:23.512]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:23.512 --> 01:31:26.014]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:31:26.014 --> 01:31:36.984]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:31:37.575 --> 01:31:39.256]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:39.256 --> 01:31:41.118]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:31:41.118 --> 01:31:48.023]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:31:48.023 --> 01:31:56.289]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at Infowars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:31:56.289 --> 01:31:57.871]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:57.871 --> 01:32:01.193]  The people strike back.
[01:32:01.193 --> 01:32:06.177]  You've probably heard about the incredible, powerful, and natural antioxidants found in red wine.
[01:32:06.519 --> 01:32:10.982]  Unfortunately, not everyone is able to drink a glass of wine each day.
[01:32:10.982 --> 01:32:15.405]  Now, you don't have to drink even a single drop, thanks to NuRev.
[01:32:15.405 --> 01:32:21.610]  NuRev is America's number one anti-aging supplement, thanks to its active ingredient resveratrol.
[01:32:21.610 --> 01:32:31.937]  Resveratrol is the main nutrient found in red wine and has been proven to help slow down the aging process, help you lose weight, override an unhealthy lifestyle, boost your energy levels,
[01:32:34.482 --> 01:32:34.782]  I think so.
[01:33:12.042 --> 01:33:26.668]  The only reason we've had so much wealth in this country is our forebearers would kill anybody that tried to enslave them.
[01:33:26.668 --> 01:33:31.010]  They wanted their private property and they were ready to die to keep it.
[01:33:31.010 --> 01:33:33.391]  And a lot of them did.
[01:33:33.391 --> 01:33:38.213]  But the elites learned to keep their hands off the American people.
[01:33:38.213 --> 01:33:39.694]  At least to a certain extent.
[01:33:42.381 --> 01:33:46.783]  And of course, the men back then didn't act tough, they were tough.
[01:33:46.783 --> 01:33:51.125]  Physically, they probably weren't as strong as the men of today.
[01:33:51.125 --> 01:33:55.308]  But their minds were strong.
[01:33:55.308 --> 01:34:03.011]  And they were committed.
[01:34:03.011 --> 01:34:07.594]  Sam Labreer, we'll keep about 10-15 minutes, then I'm going to get into the mind control and the media.
[01:34:09.383 --> 01:34:16.607]  David Icke, straight ahead in 26 minutes.
[01:34:16.607 --> 01:34:30.616]  Sam LaBriere is with 9-11 Truth up in Canada, up in Montreal, and he found out there was a conference called the New World Order, and he sent us the documents for it.
[01:34:30.616 --> 01:34:33.157]  They put out press releases, and I was familiar with the group.
[01:34:33.157 --> 01:34:37.380]  I'd read about it in SPP documents that
[01:34:39.195 --> 01:34:41.496]  We've gotten through four year acts.
[01:34:41.496 --> 01:34:53.220]  The International Economic Forum of the Americas, Conference of Montreal, Adapting to a New World Order, 15th Annual Conference, Hilton Montreal, Bonaventure Hotel, 8 to the 11th.
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:59.422]  So this ran through Thursday, ended Friday.
[01:34:59.422 --> 01:35:01.543]  Officially ended Thursday, but some still were there Friday.
[01:35:05.558 --> 01:35:07.499]  Just an amazing videos that he's posted.
[01:35:07.499 --> 01:35:11.821]  We've linked him up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, the police protecting it.
[01:35:11.821 --> 01:35:13.641]  But really, they put out this program.
[01:35:13.641 --> 01:35:21.705]  This is exactly what we say the Bilderberg Group is covering, because we've gotten some of their minutes, stolen them, and they've also publicly released some now, because they're in everybody's face.
[01:35:21.705 --> 01:35:26.687]  And it calls for a global government, global governance, how to have the central banks take over.
[01:35:27.347 --> 01:35:30.489]  So I thought we'd have him on about that, but also we only had him on twice.
[01:35:30.489 --> 01:35:32.069]  Haven't had him on from Thursday or Friday.
[01:35:32.069 --> 01:35:33.350]  What happened then?
[01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:36.372]  So to give us a final recap of this key meeting.
[01:35:36.372 --> 01:35:41.174]  Remember though, National News wrote several more stories over the weekend saying we're insane.
[01:35:41.174 --> 01:35:44.956]  Bilderberg exists, but they don't want world government.
[01:35:44.956 --> 01:35:48.818]  Yeah, and birds don't fly and fish don't swim.
[01:35:51.007 --> 01:35:53.309]  Politicians don't lie either, right?
[01:35:53.309 --> 01:35:55.350]  Let's go to Sam LaBriere.
[01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:57.012]  Sam, good to have you here with us, my friend.
[01:35:57.012 --> 01:35:58.893]  Hi, Alex.
[01:35:58.893 --> 01:35:59.554]  Good to talk to you.
[01:35:59.554 --> 01:36:00.875]  Thanks for having me.
[01:36:00.875 --> 01:36:01.595]  Good to have you, Sam.
[01:36:01.595 --> 01:36:09.421]  Okay, recap the key, what was being covered there, who you saw, and all the new big developments that unfolded.
[01:36:09.421 --> 01:36:18.148]  Well, one big thing that we learned about the conference is that it used to be done by invitation only, exactly like the Bilderberg meeting.
[01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:24.883]  And in the last few years, they've opened it up to the public more.
[01:36:24.883 --> 01:36:36.889]  You're able to buy your way in now, and apparently they're going to release all the text of all the speeches that were given on their own website because there was pressure from the public that this is too secret of a meeting and what's going on.
[01:36:36.889 --> 01:36:44.213]  Yeah, and for those that don't know, they've decided hiding and saying Bilderberg and CFR didn't exist, as they did for decades, blew up in their face.
[01:36:44.213 --> 01:36:48.355]  So now they're going, yeah, there's world government, but it's loving... Go ahead.
[01:36:49.454 --> 01:36:56.280]  Yeah, so we're still waiting to see those documents on the website and we'll let you know, we'll keep in touch about that.
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:58.462]  They're still not up.
[01:36:58.462 --> 01:37:05.528]  The big thing on Wednesday was Madeleine Albright's speech, which was called the Americas and the New World Order.
[01:37:05.528 --> 01:37:16.277]  Now, when we were interviewing people that were coming out and asked them what she talked about, a lot of them said her speech was actually very boring and she didn't talk about anything in particular.
[01:37:16.277 --> 01:37:16.617]  However,
[01:37:17.116 --> 01:37:29.138]  What we realized, talking to a lot of these people that were coming out, is if you think of the New World Order like a pyramid, and you've got Rockefeller and Kissinger at the top, these are probably a few layers down.
[01:37:29.138 --> 01:37:38.300]  This is a regional thing, just to co-opt, and to make the locals feel important, and to make them feel important, and identify resistors.
[01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:45.661]  So, it's an intelligence gathering operation with all the phones tapped in the hotel, everything NSA, Global Run, GSGQ, go ahead.
[01:37:46.417 --> 01:37:47.098]  Right, exactly.
[01:37:47.098 --> 01:37:53.728]  It's basically propagandizing the local elites to get them on board with the agenda.
[01:37:53.728 --> 01:38:00.157]  So a lot of the people that we interviewed, they don't have really a concept of the New World Order, what's really going on.
[01:38:00.157 --> 01:38:02.721]  In fact, we talked to some, it's up on YouTube,
[01:38:03.123 --> 01:38:03.623]  We're good to go.
[01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.951]  I'm not sure, to be honest.
[01:38:20.951 --> 01:38:25.895]  I mean, I was there interviewing him, and if he was lying, he's a very good liar, because we were convinced that he
[01:38:45.393 --> 01:38:46.814]  He had never heard of Bilderberg?
[01:38:46.814 --> 01:38:47.915]  No, he was being arrogant.
[01:38:47.915 --> 01:38:52.059]  Well, let me just tell you, I'm a pretty good judge of people now, after years of doing this.
[01:38:52.059 --> 01:39:00.306]  He had an arrogant false aplomb on, and yes, he was BSing you in my opinion, but go ahead.
[01:39:00.306 --> 01:39:08.253]  Well, regardless, so there was quite a few people who came out and told us that Madeleine Albright's piece was about nothing.
[01:39:08.253 --> 01:39:09.814]  When we pushed on some people,
[01:39:10.764 --> 01:39:23.767]  She said that she talked more about multilateralism and using the UN a lot more, and so it could be that if you knew what to listen for, there actually were important things in her speech, and just a lot of people didn't know what to listen for.
[01:39:23.767 --> 01:39:24.447]  We're not sure yet.
[01:39:24.447 --> 01:39:27.307]  We're hoping that they honor their promise and put up the full text.
[01:39:27.307 --> 01:39:29.188]  Well, we know what was important.
[01:39:29.188 --> 01:39:34.049]  What they put out is their press release on their own website.
[01:39:34.049 --> 01:39:35.789]  That admits global government right there.
[01:39:37.591 --> 01:39:44.593]  Yeah, yeah, towards global governance was on Monday, one of the key luncheons.
[01:39:44.593 --> 01:39:51.855]  And like you said, UNESCO, the UN was there as the main sponsor, with the Genome, Quebec, and the local newspapers.
[01:39:51.855 --> 01:39:52.195]  Go ahead.
[01:39:52.195 --> 01:39:53.935]  Yeah, it was really funny, actually.
[01:39:53.935 --> 01:39:56.336]  On Tuesday, the genomics was the big thing.
[01:39:56.336 --> 01:40:01.837]  And on Wednesday, all the reporting in the media was talking about electric cars.
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:12.267]  The big results from Tuesday were that electric cars were the new big thing, and absolutely no mention of anything related to genetics.
[01:40:12.267 --> 01:40:13.508]  Alright, let me just go over this.
[01:40:13.508 --> 01:40:21.073]  It says, Finance and Governance Monday opening plenary session of the conference towards a new global economic order.
[01:40:23.024 --> 01:40:29.314]  Modernizing financial regulation, that's translated to mean a new global bank of the world that sets all the tax rates, they admit that.
[01:40:29.314 --> 01:40:37.607]  Making innovation strategies succeed in a globalized world, that means using federal regulators to shut down all their competition and only allow the development of technologies owned by globalists.
[01:40:38.522 --> 01:40:44.446]  The financial system, after the crisis, new actors, new issues, creating new dummy corporations.
[01:40:44.446 --> 01:40:49.509]  Migration, productivity and competition, that means blasting out borders, further destroying sovereignty.
[01:40:49.509 --> 01:40:53.271]  The challenges of integration towards North American Union, that's what that means.
[01:40:53.271 --> 01:40:55.453]  The challenges of integration means integrating the countries.
[01:40:55.453 --> 01:40:58.475]  The New World Governance was discussed at noon.
[01:40:58.475 --> 01:40:59.595]  Anything on that?
[01:40:59.595 --> 01:41:03.018]  The New World Governance?
[01:41:03.018 --> 01:41:04.719]  No, that was on...
[01:41:05.876 --> 01:41:13.360]  Monday, when there was an extreme police presence, and nobody would talk to us when they were coming out.
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:14.241]  Now that was the real deal.
[01:41:14.241 --> 01:41:17.443]  And then thriving in a new financial order.
[01:41:17.443 --> 01:41:34.252]  The other interesting thing about the global governance, in the actual pamphlet with all the different events, almost every event had a little blurb describing what was going to be talked about at the event, except towards the global governance.
[01:41:34.659 --> 01:41:38.361]  Had absolutely no blurb, no description about what was going to be talked about.
[01:41:38.361 --> 01:41:39.762]  Oh.
[01:41:39.762 --> 01:41:40.903]  Yeah.
[01:41:40.903 --> 01:41:45.285]  And of course the real stuff went on at 1700, opening cocktail.
[01:41:45.285 --> 01:41:45.465]  Yeah.
[01:41:45.465 --> 01:41:49.407]  I'm sure that's when all the $2,000 an hour hookers were brought in.
[01:41:49.407 --> 01:42:00.053]  And then it goes on, sustainable development and innovations, that means seizing the economy, totally controlling what everybody can do, except for select licensed global cartels.
[01:42:00.053 --> 01:42:02.595]  Agricultural production and food safety, that means
[01:42:04.082 --> 01:42:05.043]  We're good to go.
[01:42:26.735 --> 01:42:45.847]  Sustainable development, psychological health in the workplace, more rules, more regulation, more federal minders in your business, tattling, spying, taxing, sucking, bossing, pimping, gangstering, genomics towards a revolution, total eugenics takeover, the energy forum, sustainable development, renewable energy against
[01:42:46.769 --> 01:42:53.274]  Putting, like Austin just passed, incredible for home sales or buying or any upgrades to your home.
[01:42:53.274 --> 01:42:59.639]  Huge regulations, zoning, always upping the regulations to where nobody can afford to even own a home anymore.
[01:42:59.639 --> 01:43:03.142]  If it leaks any energy or any air conditioning, you won't be able to have air conditioning.
[01:43:03.142 --> 01:43:04.242]  Total shutdown of control.
[01:43:05.143 --> 01:43:07.146]  Why invest in genomics?
[01:43:07.146 --> 01:43:09.750]  Wednesday, public-private partnerships and infrastructure.
[01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:19.764]  That's the government paying all the taxpayer money to their wives and husbands and cousins in the open door, revolving door, where the cash of big government goes into private interest hands.
[01:43:20.365 --> 01:43:25.067]  Number four, European Union, America's free trade, the sensitive issues, that's making sure the U.S.
[01:43:25.067 --> 01:43:36.632]  doesn't have any protectionism or Canada, and making sure Europe doesn't as well, so we can be fully destroyed economically by the third world, and to make sure that they then can't use us as trading partners to lift themselves as well.
[01:43:36.632 --> 01:43:43.315]  Number nine, plan a recession, the economic crisis, international trade, which global market, lessons from Brazil, China, India.
[01:43:44.435 --> 01:43:47.216]  The Americas and the New World Order will be discussed at the luncheon.
[01:43:47.216 --> 01:43:49.617]  That's an impromptu deal, so it's all off record.
[01:43:49.617 --> 01:43:51.538]  Of course, for the North American Union.
[01:43:51.538 --> 01:43:54.379]  And then Thursday, the economic crisis and the role of central banks.
[01:43:54.379 --> 01:43:55.580]  How far can they go?
[01:43:55.580 --> 01:43:59.682]  Meaning, how far can the raping and open power of the criminals go?
[01:43:59.682 --> 01:44:10.747]  That's asking locals how much raping will the locals take before they, uh, you know, how many of us have to be homeless or our children kidnapped before we finally fight back to all the scum enforcers they have having their way with us.
[01:44:10.747 --> 01:44:11.187]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:44:11.949 --> 01:44:16.391]  Right, and they had Canadian and Mexican governors of their central banks there.
[01:44:16.391 --> 01:44:20.433]  Talk about the required joint action between central banks.
[01:44:20.433 --> 01:44:24.274]  This is straight out of the Bank of International Settlements playbook.
[01:44:24.274 --> 01:44:31.317]  The central bankers are on board 110% with the New World Order and integrating North America.
[01:44:31.317 --> 01:44:38.300]  One currency for the whole continent, I mean the whole thing.
[01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:39.561]  Just incredible, my friend.
[01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:43.870]  Go back to that conversation.
[01:44:43.870 --> 01:44:44.810]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:46.431]  How much time do we have?
[01:44:46.431 --> 01:44:51.493]  Because I have a big announcement, but it might take a few minutes if we're about to go to break.
[01:44:51.493 --> 01:44:54.994]  We have about six minutes left, so make your big announcement.
[01:44:54.994 --> 01:45:01.816]  Okay, well, I'm also the creator of a website called Facts for Truth, which started last year.
[01:45:01.816 --> 01:45:05.598]  And what it was, was trying to organize facts campaigns for 9-11.
[01:45:05.598 --> 01:45:06.418]  And with this recent
[01:45:10.499 --> 01:45:18.523]  Uh, happening, Glenn Beck, uh, labeling us as, uh, or labeling the Holocaust Museum shooter as, uh, a hero to our movement.
[01:45:18.523 --> 01:45:39.873]  I've decided to, uh, to start the website up again, so I'd like to announce it on your show that, uh, factsfortruth.com is going back online, and, uh, we're starting a campaign today to get Glenn Beck fired, removed from the airwaves for his, uh, completely irresponsible slandering of an entire movement, uh, trying to label us, uh, with, uh, Holocaust deniers and such.
[01:45:41.001 --> 01:45:42.822]  Well, by the way, the London Guardian's doing that.
[01:45:42.822 --> 01:45:44.023]  That's the talking point.
[01:45:44.023 --> 01:45:47.805]  And again, this is only giving credibility to all the Nazis.
[01:45:47.805 --> 01:45:52.267]  This is only making... Most... 9-11 Truth isn't about that.
[01:45:52.267 --> 01:45:54.408]  And there's no evidence, quote, that he's our hero.
[01:45:54.408 --> 01:45:55.989]  That's just made-up crap.
[01:45:55.989 --> 01:45:59.171]  And when you hear Beck, he says, I have no proof.
[01:45:59.171 --> 01:46:05.595]  I mean, that'd be like if I said, Glenn Beck is a hero to pedophiles.
[01:46:05.595 --> 01:46:07.235]  That's not true.
[01:46:07.235 --> 01:46:09.757]  I'll say it, but it's just as asinine.
[01:46:14.078 --> 01:46:18.941]  I have to do is say, well, I can't confirm or deny this, and you can say whatever you want, apparently.
[01:46:18.941 --> 01:46:24.305]  I can't confirm or deny that Glenn Beck has children locked up in a basement and he cuts their heads off every night.
[01:46:24.305 --> 01:46:25.746]  And I want to say on record, that's not true.
[01:46:25.746 --> 01:46:30.389]  I'm joking to make the point of what he's saying.
[01:46:30.389 --> 01:46:36.133]  But why was Von Brun let out of jail after five and a half years when he tried to attack the Federal Reserve with handguns and dynamite?
[01:46:37.833 --> 01:46:39.174]  Oh, there's so many questions.
[01:46:39.174 --> 01:46:40.155]  It's a very strange case.
[01:46:40.155 --> 01:46:41.435]  These guys are fed.
[01:46:41.435 --> 01:46:48.941]  Hey, separately, did you see CNN admitted Adam Gadon's the son of the former ADL head, the head of Al-Qaeda?
[01:46:48.941 --> 01:47:02.590]  And also, the Ottawa Citizen reports in a headline creating anti-Semitism since 1965, that in 1966 and 65 the Canadian Jewish Congress helped organize the fledgling Canadian Nazi Party?
[01:47:03.277 --> 01:47:08.821]  I saw that actually today up on your website, and you were saying that it's related to the Bronfman?
[01:47:08.821 --> 01:47:11.763]  Yeah, that's who set up the Jewish con, yeah.
[01:47:11.763 --> 01:47:18.608]  Well, the Bronfmans are a huge family here in Montreal, so we're going to have to go over and ask them about this, because this is huge if it's true.
[01:47:19.212 --> 01:47:29.815]  I tell you, I don't enjoy going up against these people, but I'm tired of the Nazis, and I'm tired of using the Nazis to restrict free speech and pimping out the people killed by Hitler.
[01:47:29.815 --> 01:47:41.979]  I mean, this is also, you know, Hitler was a bad guy and did kill a lot of Jews and other people, millions of people, and it's wrong to use those people's dead to destroy liberty and freedom in the U.S.
[01:47:41.979 --> 01:47:44.520]  and do the type of free speech attacks that Hitler would do.
[01:47:45.632 --> 01:47:51.434]  And I'm just, I mean, this is really a dangerous game that the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center are using.
[01:47:51.434 --> 01:48:00.076]  Well, it's like you say, Alex, I would rather be doing anything than having to fight these New World Order type people, but we don't have a choice, right?
[01:48:00.076 --> 01:48:04.018]  We either live on our feet or die on our knees.
[01:48:04.018 --> 01:48:05.598]  That's it, my friend.
[01:48:05.598 --> 01:48:08.079]  Die on our feet or live on our knees, is what I meant to say, sorry.
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:15.103]  Well, I mean, folks, I want you to know, a lot of you are getting recruited by the Nazis because it is corrupt what Israel's doing.
[01:48:15.103 --> 01:48:16.084]  It is out of control.
[01:48:16.084 --> 01:48:24.708]  In front of the New York Times, Rahm Emanuel cracking his knuckles when the President tells him to stop.
[01:48:24.708 --> 01:48:27.950]  That's like hiking his leg and marking his territory on him.
[01:48:27.950 --> 01:48:37.075]  This is part of a more sophisticated game and it's meant to persecute Jews so they will then serve
[01:48:38.882 --> 01:48:38.922]  So,
[01:49:04.299 --> 01:49:13.487]  I've sent the information about the Facts for Truth relaunching and the new campaign to get Glenn Beck off the airwaves to Rob G. and I hope it gets posted on your website.
[01:49:13.487 --> 01:49:15.288]  It's also sent to 911Blogger.
[01:49:15.288 --> 01:49:26.937]  I'd like to offer my services to you if, in the future, any sort of event happens where we need to organize some sort of Facts campaign, it will always be open to InfoWars.
[01:49:26.937 --> 01:49:32.122]  And in the future, I hope to start campaigns in the next few weeks supporting Ron Paul's
[01:49:33.174 --> 01:49:36.237]  Separately though, are you saying you send stuff out via fax machine?
[01:49:57.915 --> 01:50:00.677]  Yes, well, on the internet now, you can send faxes for free.
[01:50:00.677 --> 01:50:03.179]  If you have an email address, you can send faxes over the internet.
[01:50:03.179 --> 01:50:04.820]  No, no, let me stop you, let me stop you.
[01:50:04.820 --> 01:50:08.403]  People tend to ignore emails now to a great extent.
[01:50:08.403 --> 01:50:18.751]  They're still useful, but absolutely, fax machines, and there aren't a bunch of spam laws on those, are devastatingly accurate because people tend to read faxes.
[01:50:18.751 --> 01:50:23.635]  And I think you've really hit on something here that's intriguing, so give folks that website out again.
[01:50:23.635 --> 01:50:25.356]  That's it.
[01:50:25.356 --> 01:50:26.377]  It's faxfortruth.com.
[01:50:28.035 --> 01:50:42.918]  And, uh, yeah, that's why I started Creative, because, like you said, emails can be deleted very easily, but faxes, it's a lot harder to ignore, and because now, with the Internet, we can send faxes for free, anybody can do it, it's a great way to, uh, organize people and, uh, make an impact.
[01:50:42.918 --> 01:50:53.941]  You know, I think the reason to go after Beck is the fact that he's CIA, just like Anderson Cooper, and he has CIA on the show every night, and he's following Homeland Security documents and battle plans.
[01:50:55.515 --> 01:50:57.698]  Stay there, let's talk more about this when we get back on the other side.
[01:51:12.022 --> 01:51:18.467]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:51:18.467 --> 01:51:20.489]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:51:20.489 --> 01:51:28.435]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[01:51:28.655 --> 01:51:29.035]  I think so.
[01:51:44.005 --> 01:51:44.405]  We're good to go.
[01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:07.406]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.406 --> 01:52:13.292]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:13.292 --> 01:52:19.459]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:19.779 --> 01:52:21.740]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:24.202]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:24.202 --> 01:52:37.409]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:52:37.409 --> 01:52:39.070]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:39.070 --> 01:52:40.931]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:52:40.931 --> 01:52:47.155]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:52:47.822 --> 01:52:56.092]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:56.092 --> 01:52:57.673]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:57.673 --> 01:52:58.855]  The people strike back!
[01:53:00.808 --> 01:53:07.034]  If you've always wanted to experience the amazing benefits from using oil of oregano, the time to act is now!

[01:53:13.659 --> 01:53:15.121]  The answer is simple.
[01:53:15.121 --> 01:53:16.642]  Purebulk.com!
[01:53:16.642 --> 01:53:21.066]  Purebulk.com brings you ultra-pure, non-diluted oil of oregano with
[01:53:21.186 --> 01:53:21.966]  We're good to go.

[01:53:51.496 --> 01:53:53.417]  That's purebulk.com.
[01:53:53.417 --> 01:53:54.017]  Or call 406-251-3270.
[01:53:54.017 --> 01:53:54.237]  406-251-3270 today!
[01:54:12.159 --> 01:54:17.085]  We're going to go ahead and start getting David Icahn here in about four minutes, so we'll do this for a full two hours.
[01:54:17.085 --> 01:54:17.906]  Always informative.
[01:54:17.906 --> 01:54:26.155]  I'm just going to throw news items out at him and get his take on each one.
[01:54:26.155 --> 01:54:31.862]  I do also want to encourage listeners to support us by buying the books and videos and materials from Infowars.com.
[01:54:35.208 --> 01:54:41.374]  We always have different things going on around here that need support, and we're having a big effect.
[01:54:41.374 --> 01:54:42.174]  Thanks to all of you.
[01:54:42.174 --> 01:54:44.576]  The Money Bomb raised $275,000.
[01:54:44.576 --> 01:54:51.443]  That will hire, I think, two more video editors, two more webmasters, and help us get the space for the next year next door.
[01:54:51.443 --> 01:54:55.346]  And by the needed equipment, because we need equipment with those employees as well.
[01:54:55.346 --> 01:55:01.071]  So I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and know this, from me, you're getting 110% of what I'm able to deliver.
[01:55:01.952 --> 01:55:06.313]  And I'm trying to up my game against the Globalists, so God bless you all, and I thank you for your support.
[01:55:06.313 --> 01:55:16.117]  And if you forgot about the Money Bomb and would like to do it, you can still do it at infowarsmoneybomb.com or 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244.
[01:55:16.117 --> 01:55:26.480]  We also have a new listener supplied because a caller called in Friday when I was doing Burmese's show and really flipped me out because he mentioned a bill to
[01:55:31.417 --> 01:55:36.409]  A federal bill to let CPS basically kidnap people's kids, and he was listing some other bills.
[01:55:38.547 --> 01:55:40.548]  And I see him going after homeschoolers everywhere.
[01:55:40.548 --> 01:55:42.128]  And this stuff just really gets to me.
[01:55:42.128 --> 01:55:47.010]  And I pointed out that listeners should just write the articles, have the blurbs, have the bill sections.
[01:55:47.010 --> 01:55:48.451]  I can't keep track of it all.
[01:55:48.451 --> 01:55:52.032]  And then we'll have an editor scan over it and make sure it's all accurate.
[01:55:52.032 --> 01:55:52.872]  And help us!
[01:55:52.872 --> 01:55:56.094]  And send those emails to writers at InfoWars.com.
[01:55:56.094 --> 01:55:57.514]  Writers at InfoWars.com.
[01:55:57.514 --> 01:56:01.116]  And I'll make sure Kurt Nemo, Rob Due, and others check that.
[01:56:01.116 --> 01:56:05.777]  See, Aaron's gone now to interview Wayne Madsen for the upcoming Obama film in D.C.
[01:56:05.777 --> 01:56:06.958]  So he can't be here.
[01:56:08.370 --> 01:56:09.852]  I don't know.
[01:56:27.924 --> 01:56:34.850]  Okay, let's go back briefly here to our guest, Sam LaBeer, New World Order Conference.
[01:56:34.850 --> 01:56:46.900]  He covered up fares in Montreal, 9-11 Truth, and the website, of course, he was just mentioning for people to go to is factsfortruth.com.
[01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:48.181]  Go ahead and finish up the point you were making.
[01:56:48.181 --> 01:56:49.182]  You've got about a minute and a half, sir.
[01:56:50.399 --> 01:56:51.519]  Okay, Alex.
[01:56:51.519 --> 01:56:56.921]  Well, very quickly, I'd encourage everybody to go to FactsForTruth.com and get involved in the campaign.
[01:56:56.921 --> 01:56:58.542]  Send a fact every day this week.
[01:56:58.542 --> 01:57:03.484]  Bombard Fox News, telling them to fire Glenn Beck for his irresponsible practices.
[01:57:03.484 --> 01:57:15.868]  And here in Montreal, people who want to get involved, we're going to be organizing a march in the city on September 11th, which we hope will coincide with marches all around North America and the rest of the world on September 11th.
[01:57:15.868 --> 01:57:18.329]  They can get involved at the website Montreal911truth.com.
[01:57:21.162 --> 01:57:33.185]  And also, one of the head members of the group, JF, is also, uh, he works very closely with Richard Gage and is responsible for the World for 9-11 Truth petition, w9t.org.
[01:57:33.185 --> 01:57:39.446]  And I'd encourage everybody to go sign the petition for a new, uh, investigation into 9-11.
[01:57:39.446 --> 01:57:42.847]  And, uh, just check out the Truth or Girls username on YouTube.
[01:57:42.847 --> 01:57:47.488]  That's Sonia from Montreal 9-11 Truth is posting all the videos from the New World Order Conference.
[01:57:48.234 --> 01:57:50.837]  And congratulations again, Alex, on the Money Bomb.
[01:57:50.837 --> 01:57:52.679]  I wish you continued success.
[01:57:52.679 --> 01:57:53.600]  I'm a big fan of yours.
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:55.201]  I have been for years.
[01:57:55.201 --> 01:57:58.024]  And you're one of the only ones I trust.
[01:57:58.024 --> 01:57:58.925]  Well, God bless you.
[01:57:58.925 --> 01:58:00.767]  I can see you have a good soul as well, Sam.
[01:58:00.767 --> 01:58:01.688]  And we'll talk to you soon.
[01:58:02.782 --> 01:58:04.163]  Okay, Alex, thanks very much.
[01:58:04.163 --> 01:58:04.483]  You bet.
[01:58:04.483 --> 01:58:06.603]  Take care, Sam LeBear.
[01:58:06.603 --> 01:58:11.525]  Now, I hope that everybody will listen to what I just said and will start writing articles.
[01:58:11.525 --> 01:58:15.166]  You see some incredible bill that gets me hyperventilating on air?
[01:58:15.166 --> 01:58:16.947]  I told my writers to write a story about it.
[01:58:16.947 --> 01:58:17.427]  They didn't.
[01:58:17.427 --> 01:58:18.488]  They're overwhelmed.
[01:58:18.488 --> 01:58:21.409]  Kurt worked Saturday and Sunday from 8 a.m.
[01:58:21.409 --> 01:58:26.471]  in the morning till midnight, because I was working too and would see him online.
[01:58:26.471 --> 01:58:27.651]  I don't have the personnel.
[01:58:27.651 --> 01:58:29.592]  Now we're going to get them.
[01:58:29.592 --> 01:58:30.172]  Thanks to you!
[01:58:31.442 --> 01:58:34.785]  Because this is a mission, that's why I get my films out for free.
[01:58:34.785 --> 01:58:35.345]  On the internet.
[01:58:35.345 --> 01:58:37.827]  Alright, we'll be right back.

[01:58:56.710 --> 01:58:58.011]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:58:58.011 --> 01:59:02.292]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.

[01:59:36.984 --> 01:59:39.025]  Go to www.
[01:59:39.485 --> 01:59:41.346]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:41.346 --> 01:59:43.927]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:43.927 --> 01:59:44.407]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.813 --> 02:00:08.575]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.575 --> 02:00:10.336]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.336 --> 02:00:11.918]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.918 --> 02:00:13.479]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.479 --> 02:00:17.663]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.663 --> 02:00:21.707]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.184 --> 02:00:24.826]  We are live, my friends.
[02:00:24.826 --> 02:00:27.048]  It is the 15th day on this Monday.
[02:00:27.048 --> 02:00:29.790]  It is Monday, June 15th, 2009.
[02:00:29.790 --> 02:00:40.860]  We've got two hours left spanning out like a vista before us as we go in through and beyond as we talk to one of the most prolific researchers.
[02:00:41.897 --> 02:00:48.919]  One of the most prolific minds out there in challenging the established false reality.
[02:00:48.919 --> 02:00:56.641]  He is a great dispenser of hundreds of millions of red pills to humanity.
[02:00:56.641 --> 02:01:03.403]  And he has taken a lot of people very, very deep down the rabbit hole, indeed, to where we're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:01:03.403 --> 02:01:08.285]  And you can question and debate the perceptions through the rose-colored darkly that
[02:01:10.046 --> 02:01:16.988]  David Icke looks through, but be careful that when you're getting the speck out of his eye, you don't get the giant beam out of yours.
[02:01:16.988 --> 02:01:18.389]  It's important to get that beam out.
[02:01:18.389 --> 02:01:27.392]  We all see through different perceptions, but certainly the perception of David Icke has proven to be much more clear than the average man or woman out there.
[02:01:27.392 --> 02:01:28.692]  So it's always great to have David with us.
[02:01:28.692 --> 02:01:31.513]  I have a host of issues I want to talk to him about.
[02:01:31.513 --> 02:01:32.593]  Where are the new world orders going?
[02:01:32.593 --> 02:01:33.354]  What they're doing currently?
[02:01:33.354 --> 02:01:35.774]  Trying to start World War III with Iran.
[02:01:35.774 --> 02:01:37.355]  Trying to start things up over there.
[02:01:38.155 --> 02:01:47.081]  Trying to stir things up with North Korea, knowing they're in the middle of a power sharing and a power transfer, saying they're going to board their ships, a new Cuban missile crisis.
[02:01:47.081 --> 02:01:48.942]  Again, we're not defending North Korea or Iran.
[02:01:48.942 --> 02:01:54.305]  The point is, it's the bigger globalist evil using a smaller evil to bring in a global distraction.
[02:01:54.305 --> 02:02:06.653]  And the South Ossetia conflict, NATO encircling Russia, Pakistan, all of this today as the world launches into economic collapse, launches into worldwide warfare, as the RAND Corporation has called for.
[02:02:07.293 --> 02:02:09.475]  So, joining us, David Icke.com is the website.
[02:02:09.475 --> 02:02:15.059]  Our websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com is the great David Icke.
[02:02:15.059 --> 02:02:16.721]  David Icke, thank you for joining us.
[02:02:16.721 --> 02:02:17.621]  It's a pleasure, Alex.
[02:02:17.621 --> 02:02:17.922]  How are you?
[02:02:18.999 --> 02:02:19.899]  Good.
[02:02:19.899 --> 02:02:24.140]  You heard me run down some of the ideas of things that I think are important right now.
[02:02:24.140 --> 02:02:29.262]  Let's start with suddenly somebody flips a switch and there's world crises.
[02:02:29.262 --> 02:02:31.162]  We're on the edge of nuclear war.
[02:02:31.162 --> 02:02:33.823]  They're saying North Korea is going to nuke.
[02:02:33.823 --> 02:02:35.764]  They're saying they're going to nuke people.
[02:02:35.764 --> 02:02:40.545]  Months ago you were on the show, three or four months ago, and you said you thought they were gearing up for a world war.
[02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:48.623]  Yeah, well that's where they want to go, because the World Wars have served them very well.
[02:02:48.623 --> 02:02:57.767]  Nothing changes society quicker and more fundamentally and completely and irreversibly than a war.
[02:02:57.767 --> 02:03:07.631]  And so, when you look at the world after World War I, it was a world that was controlled by far fewer people and much more centralization of power than before.
[02:03:08.431 --> 02:03:35.464]  World War II came along, that process took a giant leap forward, and we had all these global institutions, and the United Nations, the Bretton Woods Agreement, the European Union was justified to a large extent to stopping war in Europe, and so to complete the job, to move into this final global society that they want, a third world war is on the agenda, and I don't know if I've mentioned this before, but
[02:03:36.744 --> 02:03:50.693]  I had a letter from a traffic warden, a guy here in Britain, that's supposed to just dispense tickets for people who have broken the parking laws, and he contacted me, must be a year or so ago now,
[02:03:51.667 --> 02:03:52.068]  I don't know.
[02:04:12.615 --> 02:04:19.196]  And the third one was a card giving him, a traffic warden, the right to enter property without permission.
[02:04:19.196 --> 02:04:22.717]  And of course he's questioning, what the heck do I need these for?
[02:04:22.717 --> 02:04:25.237]  Well, just go leave them until further notice.
[02:04:25.237 --> 02:04:29.858]  He then meets a friend of his a few days later, who's a police officer.
[02:04:29.858 --> 02:04:38.319]  And he said that, this police officer said that he was a man designated in his county, and there was someone like him in every county.
[02:04:38.319 --> 02:04:40.840]  And they were there to prepare for a coming war.
[02:04:41.644 --> 02:04:42.225]  Stay there.
[02:04:42.225 --> 02:04:42.706]  Stay there, David.
[02:04:42.706 --> 02:04:44.729]  We've got a bright, long segment coming up.
[02:04:44.729 --> 02:04:46.411]  Recap that when we come back.
[02:04:46.411 --> 02:04:48.294]  Same thing is happening here.
[02:04:48.294 --> 02:04:54.583]  I can independently verify with government documents what you just said in the United States, Canada, Australia.
[02:04:54.583 --> 02:04:56.566]  You're a proper... We'll be right back with David Icke.
[02:05:01.035 --> 02:05:06.257]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:05:06.257 --> 02:05:10.278]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:10.278 --> 02:05:16.180]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:16.180 --> 02:05:21.242]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:21.242 --> 02:05:21.742]  Number three,
[02:05:22.162 --> 02:05:28.447]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:05:28.447 --> 02:05:31.349]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:05:31.349 --> 02:05:35.873]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:35.873 --> 02:05:39.476]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:05:39.716 --> 02:05:45.438]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[02:08:01.194 --> 02:08:08.878]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:13.311 --> 02:08:14.751]  Well, he needs no introduction.
[02:08:14.751 --> 02:08:17.012]  I know some stations weren't carrying that last segment.
[02:08:17.012 --> 02:08:29.574]  He was telling a story about a traffic warden, who he knows in England, who said he was given a card to put away for secret emergencies to be able to enter homes without warrants.
[02:08:29.574 --> 02:08:31.614]  And then his friend didn't really know what that would be used for.
[02:08:31.614 --> 02:08:36.695]  Then he talked to another police officer who explained to him the key piece of the puzzle.
[02:08:36.695 --> 02:08:42.396]  And then I was saying to David, I can independently verify this is even in our news, with InfraGard,
[02:08:43.942 --> 02:08:45.665]  We told people about a year before it was in the news.
[02:08:45.665 --> 02:08:47.488]  Now they admit it.
[02:08:47.488 --> 02:08:48.549]  56,000 and growing.
[02:08:48.549 --> 02:08:50.913]  That's a year old numbers.
[02:08:50.913 --> 02:08:52.075]  Infrastructure protection.
[02:08:52.075 --> 02:08:56.542]  Key people in power plants, refineries, businesses.
[02:08:56.542 --> 02:08:58.865]  I have a guy here who worked in LCRA security.
[02:08:59.981 --> 02:09:07.889]  And five years, six years ago, about a year before he worked here, they gave him a card for infrastructure security, basically a get-out-of-jail-free card.
[02:09:07.889 --> 02:09:12.233]  And all the police have these badges, they're supposed to keep them away.
[02:09:12.233 --> 02:09:20.001]  And they're saying, oh yes, the American people are the terrorists, the British people are the terrorists, Homeland Security's for them, martial law's coming, a war is coming.
[02:09:20.001 --> 02:09:22.063]  David, continue with what the police officer told you.
[02:09:23.052 --> 02:09:34.556]  Well, the police officer, who is a friend of this traffic warden, he called him aside one day and said, look, because I'm a good friend of yours, I'm going to tell you this, but he said five times in the conversation, you must not tell anyone else.
[02:09:34.556 --> 02:09:42.618]  And what the police officer said was that he had a job in that county, and there was someone like him in every other county of the United Kingdom.
[02:09:42.618 --> 02:09:49.721]  And their job in the police force was to prepare for a coming war, which they knew was coming, and they were preparing for it well in advance.
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:10:09.954]  The military and the regular police were going to be used to meet what they knew was coming in terms of civil unrest in the streets when that war started and then the build-up to that war.
[02:10:09.954 --> 02:10:18.621]  And he said, you people, traffic wardens and private security guards and other such people, are going to be given powers
[02:10:20.001 --> 02:10:26.825]  That the police normally do, so that you can do those things while we're dealing with the civil unrest as a result of this war.
[02:10:26.825 --> 02:10:44.213]  And very, very shortly after the traffic warden contacted me, the government changed the name of traffic wardens from traffic wardens to civil enforcement officers, and gave them more powers, not all the powers, but more powers that the police normally do.
[02:10:44.213 --> 02:10:46.614]  And then about six months later,
[02:10:47.466 --> 02:11:10.267]  The government announced a new type of person called accredited persons and these were, wait for it, private security guards and all the kind of people that the policeman had listed who were going to be given the right to stop and question people, to hand out certain fines, to hold them until the police arrived and it's all part of this
[02:11:11.108 --> 02:11:24.693]  Uh, layer by layer building of self-policing, the people self-policing each other, because, of course, when there's a few of you, and you got, you want to control the many, there's not enough of you physically to do it.
[02:11:24.693 --> 02:11:31.495]  So you have to get your target population, or many of the people within it, to police the target population.
[02:11:31.495 --> 02:11:38.158]  You have to get the sheep herd to police each other, so they don't need, uh, so many sheep dogs externally, uh, and
[02:11:38.898 --> 02:11:42.381]  Shepherds externally, that the sheep are doing it for themselves.
[02:11:42.381 --> 02:12:04.880]  And this is what's being built all over the world, and this Third World War is definitely in the agenda because it's a massive problem which will be in need of a global, because of the global nature of the conflict, a global solution, which will be the final move to this structure we've been talking about all these years, of world government, world army, and all the rest of it.
[02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:05.841]  And of course, the world army
[02:12:06.664 --> 02:12:08.366]  Okay, David, I just want to back you up.
[02:12:21.656 --> 02:12:30.106]  Because people are hearing this or months from now watching this on YouTube or PrisonPlanet.TV and they're saying, okay, what's the proof?
[02:12:30.106 --> 02:12:37.335]  Everything David just said, every term he used, I have hundreds of mainstream articles, government documents.
[02:12:37.335 --> 02:12:38.497]  Let me just go over a few of them.
[02:12:39.619 --> 02:12:45.063]  Here in the United States, they are preparing paramilitary police.
[02:12:45.063 --> 02:12:47.384]  It's announced by the Air Force, the Army.
[02:12:47.384 --> 02:12:52.968]  They have a regular Army in Tennessee without warrants, running warrantless checkpoints in the newspaper.
[02:12:52.968 --> 02:12:59.233]  North Com has announced that they are to take on the American people, the Homeland Security documents.
[02:13:00.093 --> 02:13:08.238]  Uh, DHS documents we broke that made national news, state the number one threat is returning vets, gun owners, that the whole homeland security system is for us.
[02:13:08.238 --> 02:13:10.880]  The British Ministry of Defense 10-year report
[02:13:12.045 --> 02:13:35.323]  London Guardian reported on it, but it was declassified, 120 pages, was put out in September of 2007, and said in the coming next few years the public would rebel against the corrupt government, but that their job was to suppress the public, to bring us into this new world order, and it said they will, even if the British people, they say, try to march on London,
[02:13:36.064 --> 02:13:37.745]  They will use neutron bombs on them.
[02:13:52.694 --> 02:13:58.316]  The spooks, the paramilitary, the police, the traffic wardens, auxiliary tattletales.
[02:13:58.316 --> 02:14:02.497]  There's now the Trusted Traveler North American Hemispheric card.
[02:14:02.497 --> 02:14:08.479]  And if you have that flying internally, say from Austin to New York, you show that and go through the head of the line.
[02:14:08.479 --> 02:14:13.841]  So they're already making it that if you waive all your rights and take the special card, you get to the head of the line.
[02:14:13.841 --> 02:14:16.342]  Then they're just going to make it mandatory for everybody.
[02:14:16.342 --> 02:14:16.742]  David Icke.
[02:14:17.315 --> 02:14:18.215]  Well, that's what they do.
[02:14:18.215 --> 02:14:26.900]  I mean, they say, oh, this will be voluntary for the people to decide if they want to have it, like identity cards and stuff like that.
[02:14:26.900 --> 02:14:31.903]  But what they then do is make it so difficult to operate in society without one of them.
[02:14:31.903 --> 02:14:38.486]  And eventually they say, well, look, there's so few people that don't have them now, everyone might as well have them by law and all the rest of it.
[02:14:38.486 --> 02:14:40.027]  These are the techniques they use.
[02:14:40.027 --> 02:14:42.168]  And of course, as we've talked about before on the show,
[02:14:43.476 --> 02:14:44.277]  I think so.
[02:14:59.740 --> 02:15:05.123]  Civil Army, in effect, that he's been talking about, and Rahm Emanuel's been talking about.
[02:15:05.123 --> 02:15:16.428]  And that is another key layer of this policing of the people by the people, which is what you had in Nazi Germany, and that's what tyrannies always do.
[02:15:16.428 --> 02:15:28.053]  And, you know, people have got to decide how long we're going to talk about this before we draw a line in the sand and say, hey, instead of sitting here and watching
[02:15:28.815 --> 02:15:34.058]  Our prison being built and discussing it and debating it, what the heck are we going to do about it?
[02:15:34.058 --> 02:15:42.764]  Because there's going to come a point where we're going to cross a line where this momentum is going to be very difficult to turn back.
[02:15:42.764 --> 02:15:52.590]  It needs a lot of people with a lot of focus and a lot of disconnection of backsides from sofas now before this gets completely and utterly out of hand.
[02:15:54.892 --> 02:16:02.134]  Well, David Icke, I heartily agree with you and we're going to talk about a host of issues today.
[02:16:02.134 --> 02:16:08.696]  And later in the next hour, let's get into some of your ideas for solutions and breaking free of this matrix.
[02:16:08.696 --> 02:16:12.918]  In fact, let's go ahead and start talking about some of that now.
[02:16:12.918 --> 02:16:21.360]  Coming up in the next segment, I'm going to play a video clip from a satire movie about sitcoms.
[02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:22.541]  But when you watch it,
[02:16:23.835 --> 02:16:42.047]  It actually has the same messages that really are in the children's programming and the sitcoms, and they're dumbing the language down, and they're reducing the language, and how many words people use, and people are talking slower, and people don't even understand common words now.
[02:16:42.047 --> 02:16:44.749]  People are being inserted into the matrix.
[02:16:45.740 --> 02:16:55.745]  As the eyes tie into the television and the computers and people are texting to their friends who are five feet away, instead of talking to them, we are beginning to merge into the machines.
[02:16:55.745 --> 02:17:01.288]  We're not programming them, we're being programmed through the machines that have been programmed to program us.
[02:17:01.288 --> 02:17:07.011]  And the consciousness is closing down with large swaths of the public, while at the same time,
[02:17:07.831 --> 02:17:22.563]  Another large group is exploding their awakening and how you see this battle unfolding as we rush towards what the establishment calls the singularity.
[02:17:22.563 --> 02:17:23.924]  So David, what's your take on that?
[02:17:24.798 --> 02:17:26.439]  I'm sorry, I thought we were going to a break.
[02:17:26.439 --> 02:17:30.021]  No, no, I'm saying when we come back from break, I'm going to play a clip, but I mean now... Oh, gotcha, gotcha.
[02:17:30.021 --> 02:17:31.561]  I thought we were going to a break now.
[02:17:31.561 --> 02:17:44.568]  No, I mean, you know, this is my area, really, in so many ways, because particularly since about 2002, 2003, I've really gone very, very deeply into the nature of reality, which not many people tend to do.
[02:17:44.568 --> 02:17:52.892]  And when you start to realize what reality is, my goodness, does society as it's structured, and the way it's structured, start to make perfect sense.
[02:17:52.892 --> 02:17:53.433]  First of all,
[02:17:54.642 --> 02:17:59.166]  It's so important to realize the difference between the body and consciousness.
[02:17:59.166 --> 02:18:00.707]  It's not the same thing.
[02:18:00.707 --> 02:18:19.043]  Now, you know, we may have differing religions, different people listen to this show, but one thing is kind of common to them is that some kind of consciousness, soul, whatever you want to call it, is apart from the body and leaves the body at what we call death.
[02:18:19.043 --> 02:18:20.585]  Therefore, the body and the
[02:18:21.625 --> 02:18:24.924]  The soul, the consciousness, whatever you want to call it, are not the same thing.
[02:18:26.282 --> 02:18:35.908]  The idea of the conspiracy, the very bottom line of the conspiracy, is to disconnect those higher levels of awareness from what is a computer, the body.
[02:18:35.908 --> 02:18:40.872]  The body is a biological computer and it ticks every single box of that.
[02:18:40.872 --> 02:18:51.879]  And what I mean by biological is it's not like a desktop computer where you put data in and you press a button and you know exactly what it's going to do because it's programmed to do that, although we're getting more and more like that.
[02:18:51.879 --> 02:18:55.041]  Biological computer means it has the ability to think and assess data.
[02:18:55.641 --> 02:18:57.523]  This is what the immune system is doing all the time.
[02:18:57.523 --> 02:19:04.648]  It's scanning data, what's happening in the body, and reacting to it as it sees fit in the circumstances that it faces.
[02:19:04.648 --> 02:19:05.909]  The idea of the conspiracy...
[02:19:06.847 --> 02:19:07.267]  I think.
[02:19:27.518 --> 02:19:27.958]  We're good to go.
[02:19:51.707 --> 02:20:00.676]  More and more, I mean, I've always known this concept to be true, you know, the scientists and mine warfare experts say it themselves, but now I'm consciously really realizing it.
[02:20:00.676 --> 02:20:05.141]  Stay with us.
[02:20:05.141 --> 02:20:06.362]  Newsflash!
[02:20:06.362 --> 02:20:08.103]  Unemployment is soaring over 10%.
[02:20:08.103 --> 02:20:13.209]  The dollar is plummeting and banks are beginning to close their doors.
[02:20:14.615 --> 02:20:18.756]  Financial experts are saying we are headed for an economic depression.
[02:20:18.756 --> 02:20:23.217]  The world is on the brink of total meltdown.
[02:20:23.217 --> 02:20:30.219]  Unless you expect the government to bail you out, you must be able to grow your own healthy food.
[02:20:30.219 --> 02:20:38.542]  Survivalistseeds.com has just released a brand new heirloom seed pack at a dramatically reduced price.
[02:20:38.542 --> 02:20:42.363]  So you and your family have a long-term food solution.
[02:20:43.863 --> 02:20:47.645]  The choice between starvation and freedom is made by you.
[02:20:47.645 --> 02:20:48.805]  Right now.
[02:20:48.805 --> 02:20:51.326]  Go to survivalistseeds.com.
[02:20:51.326 --> 02:20:53.647]  That's survivalistseeds.com.
[02:20:53.647 --> 02:20:57.049]  Because you are almost out of time.
[02:20:57.049 --> 02:21:02.271]  Survivalistseeds.com.
[02:21:02.271 --> 02:21:07.513]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:21:08.289 --> 02:21:14.171]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:21:14.171 --> 02:21:20.673]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:21:20.673 --> 02:21:22.634]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:21:22.634 --> 02:21:25.114]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:21:25.114 --> 02:21:35.978]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:21:38.288 --> 02:21:39.949]  It's not about left or right.
[02:21:39.949 --> 02:21:41.810]  It's about a one world government.
[02:21:41.810 --> 02:21:48.732]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:21:48.732 --> 02:21:56.996]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:21:56.996 --> 02:21:58.556]  The Obama Deception.
[02:21:58.556 --> 02:21:59.737]  The people strike back.
[02:22:02.435 --> 02:22:04.436]  Hi, I'm John Swenson at Midas Resources.
[02:22:04.436 --> 02:22:08.560]  800-686-2237, extension 128.
[02:22:08.560 --> 02:22:10.701]  And let's take in a brief mind movie.
[02:22:10.701 --> 02:22:16.365]  We're surrounded by jesters, members of the nation's largest clown club based in Washington, D.C.
[02:22:16.365 --> 02:22:22.190]  Fuzzy hair, baggy pants, big yellow shoes, and now offering financial assurances that all will be well.
[02:22:22.190 --> 02:22:24.191]  The stimulus package is working.
[02:22:24.191 --> 02:22:26.073]  A bailout is coming your way.
[02:22:26.073 --> 02:22:30.276]  And while we're flat broke, we're also told that we've stepped back away from the brink.
[02:22:30.276 --> 02:22:30.576]  Pardon me?
[02:22:31.403 --> 02:22:32.643]  Back to the real world.
[02:22:32.643 --> 02:22:36.904]  We know that we can rely on no one but ourselves to generate financial security.
[02:22:36.904 --> 02:22:39.465]  Protecting your assets is solely up to you.
[02:22:39.465 --> 02:22:41.165]  No one else is coming to the rescue.
[02:22:41.165 --> 02:22:52.647]  Please call me, John Swenson, 800-686-2237, extension 128, to discuss investing in precious metals, gold and silver, with a 6,000 year track record of success and security.
[02:22:52.647 --> 02:22:59.629]  I'm John Swenson, 800-686-2237, extension 128, and together we'll create a package that really works for you.
[02:23:01.741 --> 02:23:02.442]  You worry.
[02:23:02.442 --> 02:23:04.783]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[02:23:04.783 --> 02:23:05.324]  Hi.
[02:23:05.324 --> 02:23:08.126]  Summer's coming, and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[02:23:08.126 --> 02:23:12.670]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[02:23:12.670 --> 02:23:15.132]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[02:23:15.132 --> 02:23:18.494]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[02:23:18.494 --> 02:23:20.416]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[02:23:20.416 --> 02:23:23.218]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[02:23:23.218 --> 02:23:26.941]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[02:23:26.941 --> 02:23:30.984]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[02:23:31.324 --> 02:23:35.426]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[02:23:35.426 --> 02:23:41.749]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[02:23:41.749 --> 02:23:44.110]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[02:23:44.110 --> 02:23:46.231]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[02:23:46.231 --> 02:23:50.873]  So go to offthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:23:50.873 --> 02:23:51.793]  Start now.
[02:23:51.793 --> 02:23:53.514]  Knowledge is power.
[02:23:53.514 --> 02:23:54.515]  Better take action.
[02:23:54.515 --> 02:23:55.475]  I think a storm's coming.
[02:24:04.462 --> 02:24:09.484]  Got David Icke with us for another hour and 35 minutes.
[02:24:09.484 --> 02:24:12.685]  And what David here is talking about is so important.
[02:24:19.977 --> 02:24:39.212]  When you're in a view kind of above yourself, outside the world, realizing that this is a biological earth suit, and that the system knows how to program it with hormones and drugs and war and feedback and sex, when they're using sex to sell Calvin Klein jeans,
[02:24:41.866 --> 02:24:46.488]  They are going at your primitive sexual centers in your lower brain.
[02:24:46.488 --> 02:24:48.029]  This is all a fact.
[02:24:48.029 --> 02:24:58.773]  And just to get the public to realize they're being bombarded, they're being programmed, if you can get them to do that, they kind of wake up out of the trance, realize you're being bombarded, realize there's a game.
[02:24:58.773 --> 02:25:06.036]  I mean, I don't know how to quantify this, David, but, you know, to me, you talk about being outside, you know, of the body consciousness or whatever.
[02:25:07.415 --> 02:25:13.338]  I mean, to me, the term I would use is just realize that you are being bombarded with data.
[02:25:13.338 --> 02:25:17.960]  Realize that there is a manipulation going on, knowing it's half the battle.
[02:25:18.590 --> 02:25:19.851]  Well, see, this is so important.
[02:25:19.851 --> 02:25:21.713]  I'll give you an example.
[02:25:21.713 --> 02:25:28.860]  In my talks, I put some pictures on the screen, which are subliminal advertisements.
[02:25:28.860 --> 02:25:35.866]  And most people, the vast majority of people, can't see them because that's what subliminal is, below threshold.
[02:25:35.866 --> 02:25:41.592]  The conscious mind doesn't see them, which the conscious mind actually sees very little compared with what actually is in front of it.
[02:25:42.112 --> 02:25:51.920]  The subconscious mind, however, picks it all up and affects the person's reality without them realising it by the message that's been passed through the subliminal image.
[02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:59.947]  And then I will put the picture back up again a few minutes later, and this is the same with all subliminals.
[02:25:59.947 --> 02:26:06.873]  The first thing you see, once it's been pointed out earlier, when you see the picture again, is the subliminal.
[02:26:11.394 --> 02:26:13.156]  I think it's important.
[02:26:32.078 --> 02:26:42.204]  And we need to understand the fundamental significance to the whole conspiracy of something called the reptilian brain.
[02:26:42.204 --> 02:26:49.148]  The reptilian brain is where we get, along with other parts of the brain, but massively the reptilian brain, our survival instincts.
[02:26:49.148 --> 02:26:51.009]  The reptilian brain is basically stupid.
[02:26:51.705 --> 02:26:52.806]  David, let me stop you.
[02:26:52.806 --> 02:26:55.308]  This is not debatable about the reptilian brain.
[02:26:55.308 --> 02:26:57.289]  This is a scientific name.
[02:26:57.289 --> 02:26:58.210]  Put it up on the screen.
[02:26:58.210 --> 02:27:01.792]  Google reptilian brain and show them like a textbook area.
[02:27:01.792 --> 02:27:08.056]  That's the lower brain that's breathing, sex, eating, wanting to kill people.
[02:27:08.056 --> 02:27:14.400]  I'm just interrupting you because some may think, oh, this is David Icke and his other issues with that.
[02:27:15.701 --> 02:27:25.786]  No, no, the scientists call it the R-complex, or the reptilian brain, because the way it functions and the way it reacts is almost exactly like the brain of a reptile or a lizard.
[02:27:25.786 --> 02:27:26.426]  But it is!
[02:27:26.426 --> 02:27:37.191]  I mean, in fact, students, gives my dad went to medical school, students shown a salt crocodile brain can't tell the difference with a human lower brain.
[02:27:37.191 --> 02:27:39.853]  We basically do have a salt crocodile brain.
[02:27:39.853 --> 02:27:40.153]  Go ahead.
[02:27:40.433 --> 02:28:02.135]  Yeah, and what happens is that those behind the dark suits, those in the shadows, who understand all this stuff and have worked constantly for centuries to take it out of circulation among the people, so they're in ignorance of the very means through which they're being manipulated, they understand this and they target
[02:28:02.791 --> 02:28:05.854]  The reptilian brain is basically stupid.
[02:28:05.854 --> 02:28:07.235]  It's a reaction system.
[02:28:07.235 --> 02:28:10.658]  It is so computer-like, it's incredible.
[02:28:10.658 --> 02:28:18.786]  At that level, the brain does just react like a computer on a desktop, and it doesn't learn from experience.
[02:28:18.786 --> 02:28:21.969]  Other parts of the brain learn from experience.
[02:28:22.769 --> 02:28:24.511]  The reptilian brain doesn't.
[02:28:24.511 --> 02:28:26.332]  Its survival instincts are total.
[02:28:26.332 --> 02:28:32.978]  It's constantly scanning the environment, looking for possible dangers as it perceives them.
[02:28:32.978 --> 02:28:39.985]  The idea of the manipulation is to give the reptilian brain more and more and more reasons
[02:28:40.811 --> 02:28:42.192]  We're good to go.
[02:29:05.057 --> 02:29:05.338]  Thank you.
[02:29:21.460 --> 02:29:22.440]  It's all about survival.
[02:29:22.440 --> 02:29:29.583]  So it perceives the need for sexual reproduction as part of its survival.
[02:29:29.583 --> 02:29:30.704]  That's understandable.
[02:29:30.704 --> 02:29:36.466]  But also, it sees in the world that we live in, money as fundamental to its survival.
[02:29:36.466 --> 02:29:42.368]  So the whole money issues that people have, the fear of not having money, the wanting more... Stay there.
[02:29:42.368 --> 02:29:43.149]  This is key.
[02:29:43.149 --> 02:29:44.629]  Sex and money.
[02:29:44.629 --> 02:29:45.449]  All of it.
[02:29:45.449 --> 02:29:46.150]  Key information.
[02:29:46.150 --> 02:29:47.930]  Long segment coming up.
[02:29:47.930 --> 02:29:48.371]  Right there.
[02:29:48.371 --> 02:29:48.891]  We'll come back.
[02:29:49.671 --> 02:29:51.313]  With the master plan.
[02:29:51.313 --> 02:29:51.674]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.674 --> 02:29:53.036]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.036 --> 02:29:55.559]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.559 --> 02:29:58.242]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:02.582 --> 02:31:05.404]  A New World Order.
[02:31:05.404 --> 02:31:10.286]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:31:10.286 --> 02:31:13.148]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:31:13.148 --> 02:31:15.930]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[02:31:15.930 --> 02:31:19.112]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:31:19.112 --> 02:31:26.436]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:31:29.448 --> 02:31:34.892]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:31:34.892 --> 02:31:38.775]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:31:38.775 --> 02:31:41.337]  Bill Burr is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:31:41.337 --> 02:31:42.498]  Most people have no idea.
[02:31:42.498 --> 02:31:43.279]  They're not after money.
[02:31:43.279 --> 02:31:44.560]  They have all the money they need.
[02:31:44.560 --> 02:31:45.540]  They're after power.
[02:31:45.540 --> 02:31:46.701]  That's what they're after these days.

[02:32:00.129 --> 02:32:07.336]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[02:32:07.336 --> 02:32:11.901]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.

[02:33:12.125 --> 02:33:16.866]  There's a man going around taking names.
[02:33:16.866 --> 02:33:22.467]  And he decides who to free and who to blame.
[02:33:22.467 --> 02:33:27.128]  Everybody will be treated all the same.
[02:33:27.128 --> 02:33:30.049]  There will be a golden letter reaching down.
[02:33:30.049 --> 02:33:32.869]  You know what Revelation talks about?
[02:33:32.869 --> 02:33:36.870]  How the kings of the earth traffic in the souls of men.
[02:33:38.823 --> 02:33:46.565]  And, you know, you read the old fables, and it describes kingdoms that were under spells, where they couldn't see corruption, couldn't see lies.
[02:33:46.565 --> 02:33:51.346]  And once you've committed to lies, little lies, then you start buying into the bigger ones.
[02:33:51.346 --> 02:33:52.366]  Torture's okay.
[02:33:52.366 --> 02:33:54.427]  Secret arrest is okay.
[02:33:54.427 --> 02:33:58.148]  You know, we're the good guys, but we're a country that loves death and destruction.
[02:33:58.148 --> 02:34:02.869]  And when you read the psychologists, the psychologists, the
[02:34:05.213 --> 02:34:14.776]  The sociologist, the anthropologist, the psychiatrist, the Edward Bernays 80-90 years ago, they all brag how we're dumb slaves.
[02:34:14.776 --> 02:34:20.458]  They all brag how they're programming us, how they're manipulating us, how they control everything we do.
[02:34:21.238 --> 02:34:29.501]  They're on incredible power trips, and they put on this fake liberal facade, but they're a bunch of cold-blooded trash breaking up the family.
[02:34:29.501 --> 02:34:33.343]  All their major textbooks that we've shown you here say the family's their enemy.
[02:34:33.343 --> 02:34:37.505]  You know, and people say, oh, they want to break the family up, or oh, they want to dumb us down.
[02:34:37.505 --> 02:34:40.006]  That isn't just a figment of imagination.
[02:34:40.006 --> 02:34:45.468]  That's not just a statement or a verbal fancy.
[02:34:47.560 --> 02:34:49.222]  It's the reality.
[02:34:49.222 --> 02:34:57.111]  And it's a group of humans setting up a predatory system where they engage in their predator hunting mode against their own people.
[02:34:57.111 --> 02:35:00.655]  And they're breeding us and dumbing us down to be more easily controlled.
[02:35:00.655 --> 02:35:01.796]  That's what David Icke is talking about.
[02:35:01.796 --> 02:35:04.179]  I just took two years of RTF.
[02:35:04.679 --> 02:35:05.600]  Radio, television, film.
[02:35:05.600 --> 02:35:19.016]  The first textbook was all about subliminal messages on radio 80 years ago, and TV 60 years ago, and in movie theaters, and how the billboards have it, and how they use sex to sell, and how they're hitting the reptilian brain.
[02:35:19.016 --> 02:35:23.701]  This is a fact, and so they're feeding through this virtual matrix
[02:35:24.542 --> 02:35:25.583]  And that's what it is.
[02:35:25.583 --> 02:35:28.305]  It's not a physical matrix with us in tanks.
[02:35:28.305 --> 02:35:41.857]  It's our brain in a tank, inside this body suit, being programmed by the false world, by the image makers of television in Madison Avenue, to keep us off the real world and the whole universe around us.
[02:35:41.857 --> 02:35:46.361]  Through fear, through the desire for money, sex, survival, all of this.
[02:35:46.361 --> 02:35:50.765]  But when you do what Christ said and turn loose, he that gives up his life gains his life.
[02:35:50.765 --> 02:35:52.146]  He that tries to save it loses it.
[02:35:53.442 --> 02:36:01.224]  That means when you're ready to give it all up and just don't care anymore and stop letting that program totally control you, then you go to the next level.
[02:36:01.224 --> 02:36:14.288]  And that doesn't mean we don't bounce back and forth between the higher mind, the cerebral cortex, where they say the cognitive and the soul's dwelling, and if you don't believe that, fine, that's your issue, and the animal brain.
[02:36:14.288 --> 02:36:15.448]  Regardless, through this
[02:36:16.894 --> 02:36:44.606]  Electrochemical computer, we are being programmed and manipulated, and the establishment brags about it, and they put compulsions and mental blocks in you, through culture, through television, through the jokes they make on TV, that then are repeated by people on the ground, giving it reality, in this plane of existence, not in the cyber world, the make-believe TV world, that's now becoming reality, that it's not kosher to talk about these things, and so people are in a prison for their mind.
[02:36:44.606 --> 02:36:45.687]  David Icke, please continue.
[02:36:47.251 --> 02:36:59.917]  I've just been ticking off little things, issues that you brought up, and they come under one heading, reptilian brain.
[02:36:59.917 --> 02:37:03.079]  From the reptilian brain we get all the survival mechanisms, yes, for which
[02:37:04.238 --> 02:37:05.179]  We're good to go.
[02:37:28.871 --> 02:37:40.858]  Of course, a big time into their satanic rituals, but if you look at human society, Alex, it's just a daily repeating of ritual repeating behavior.
[02:37:40.858 --> 02:37:45.741]  The reptilian brain, we get the desire for top-down hierarchical structures of power.
[02:37:45.741 --> 02:37:47.442]  Look at the world!
[02:37:47.442 --> 02:37:50.384]  It's an expression of the reptilian brain.
[02:37:50.384 --> 02:37:53.246]  You were talking there about, you know, addictions.
[02:37:53.246 --> 02:37:56.067]  Well, addictions come from the reptilian brain.
[02:37:56.067 --> 02:37:58.429]  Addiction to money, addiction to sex, addiction to
[02:37:58.929 --> 02:37:59.890]  We're good to go.
[02:38:22.342 --> 02:38:23.102]  Terrorism.
[02:38:23.102 --> 02:38:25.083]  Oh yes, war on terror.
[02:38:25.083 --> 02:38:26.264]  Weapons of mass destruction.
[02:38:26.264 --> 02:38:27.184]  Yes, invade Iraq.
[02:38:27.184 --> 02:38:27.984]  Oh yes, anything.
[02:38:27.984 --> 02:38:28.765]  Oh my god.
[02:38:28.765 --> 02:38:41.190]  It's all through the reptilian brain because they understand how it works and we need to understand how it works because once we do that, the defense mechanisms start to go up and also we can start to observe our own behavior.
[02:38:41.190 --> 02:38:49.153]  When we're reacting to things in an emotional way without calm thinking, then
[02:38:50.033 --> 02:38:50.934]  We can stop.
[02:38:50.934 --> 02:38:54.497]  I mean, I've been working on this for years now in myself.
[02:38:54.497 --> 02:38:59.962]  You get halfway through a sentence and you stop and you think, no, that's the reptilian brain being activated.
[02:38:59.962 --> 02:39:14.174]  And what you're doing as you do that, as you recognize it, is you're stopping it having that reactive power over you that it had before, and you move into other parts of the brain in terms of the way that you filter reality and information and
[02:39:15.494 --> 02:39:17.234]  And those get more developed.
[02:39:17.234 --> 02:39:26.436]  You start seeing the universe more and more through the higher levels of the brain, and then knowledge just explosively opens where you can't even describe it.
[02:39:26.436 --> 02:39:35.018]  Well, how can you accumulate real knowledge and awareness when you're spending the day reacting emotionally all the time?
[02:39:35.018 --> 02:39:40.499]  And, you know, I would say to people, because, you know, I'm not sitting cross-legged on a mountain here saying, hey, I'm the Buddha.
[02:39:40.499 --> 02:39:42.559]  I'm telling you all how it is, and I'm perfect.
[02:39:42.999 --> 02:39:47.402]  We all are in these biological computers.
[02:39:47.402 --> 02:39:51.484]  The question is, are we going to let them live us, or are we going to live them?
[02:39:51.484 --> 02:39:54.126]  Are we going to live life, or are we going to allow life to live us?
[02:39:54.126 --> 02:39:57.988]  Because most people allow life to live them because of these reactive processes.
[02:39:57.988 --> 02:40:00.449]  Well, that's what John Carpenter is saying.
[02:40:01.770 --> 02:40:04.632]  They live, the controllers, we sleep.
[02:40:04.632 --> 02:40:09.136]  We're sleeping when we're in the reptilian brain, also tied into sleep.
[02:40:09.136 --> 02:40:12.018]  We are unconscious, we're really dead.
[02:40:12.018 --> 02:40:15.220]  And they live, it's all a big joke to them.
[02:40:15.220 --> 02:40:20.965]  Yeah, and if we can start to take control of our reactions.
[02:40:22.777 --> 02:40:44.018]  When you kind of come from this point of view and you just observe yourself for a few days, just observe yourself and the way you react, and you'll see how many conflicts between individuals, arguments, emotional responses that are right over the top, and the way that we immediately react to something instead of saying, hold on a second,
[02:40:45.009 --> 02:40:45.970]  Take a deep breath.
[02:40:45.970 --> 02:40:49.552]  Let's just calmly look at this before we start making instant decisions.
[02:40:49.552 --> 02:40:57.077]  When you do that, you realize how many times a day the reptilian brain decides your decisions for you.
[02:40:57.077 --> 02:40:59.599]  It's unbelievable the number of times it happens.
[02:40:59.599 --> 02:41:12.207]  And collectively, of course, there's a collective version of this where you have the mob rule and all the rest of it, where the reptilian brain is manipulated collectively to have a collective response and emotional reaction.
[02:41:12.207 --> 02:41:14.749]  And we've got to get control of the computer system.
[02:41:15.109 --> 02:41:16.090]  Alright, let me expand on that.
[02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:48.799]  Because it's been scientifically proven, as you know, but for listeners who may not, by thousands of universities for over a hundred years, that mice and other animals know when a hurricane or an earthquake is coming days or sometimes weeks beforehand
[02:41:49.540 --> 02:42:17.920]  They can also do double-blind studies where there's a 20-foot wall, you can't hear what's going on in the next room, but if people are agitated in the next room, or being hurt, brainwaves, you know, go into a pattern of disarray or being upset yourself, kind of that hundredth monkey, and the system is trying to suppress this awakening, or, you know, I mean, just in scientific terms, from people being, you know, on a higher level,
[02:42:19.676 --> 02:42:21.497]  When it comes to the use of their brain.
[02:42:21.497 --> 02:42:23.698]  So, that's why they're putting the fluoride in the water.
[02:42:23.698 --> 02:42:25.479]  That's why they're injecting us with mercury.
[02:42:25.479 --> 02:42:28.001]  That's why they're feeding us the GMO food.
[02:42:28.001 --> 02:42:34.344]  All of this, that's why the television's dumbing everything down, lowering everything down.
[02:42:34.344 --> 02:42:37.966]  How do you see this battle shaking out, David Icke?
[02:42:38.450 --> 02:42:50.880]  Well, if we don't become conscious and get out of control by computer programs, then it's going to go on, because the computer programs are going to keep following the program.
[02:42:50.880 --> 02:43:03.070]  This is why it's so important that no matter what our religious or non-religious or belief or anything, that we put that aside and look at the things that unite us instead of those that divide us.
[02:43:03.070 --> 02:43:05.432]  And like I said a few minutes ago, Alex, you know, we have
[02:43:05.472 --> 02:43:15.275]  All these religions who argue and cuss and fight, but when you get to the core of them, the real core of them, they're not a million miles from what I'm talking about here.
[02:43:15.275 --> 02:43:20.236]  If you get it down to the, you know, people can argue about the detail, I don't see why we should argue about the detail.
[02:43:20.236 --> 02:43:22.817]  I mean, you know, believe what you like so long as you don't enforce it on anyone else.
[02:43:22.817 --> 02:43:31.580]  But, you know, the basics of, we are something beyond the body, and when the body dies, that something leaves, which I call awareness, other people call the soul.
[02:43:33.169 --> 02:43:46.456]  If we can start to get down to these levels where we all basically agree, then we can start working together without letting the fault lines of detail and religious dogma divide us.
[02:43:46.456 --> 02:43:50.838]  And we need to move our point of observation from the body, instead of looking in the mirror.
[02:43:51.784 --> 02:43:51.864]  I'm
[02:44:07.089 --> 02:44:14.274]  But you can have a name without actually being completely controlled by the fact that that's who you are.
[02:44:14.274 --> 02:44:16.775]  See, I don't consider myself to be David Icke.
[02:44:16.775 --> 02:44:20.578]  That's the name of an experience I'm having now at this time.
[02:44:20.578 --> 02:44:23.359]  I am consciousness having that experience.
[02:44:23.359 --> 02:44:29.403]  And when you come from that point of view, you don't get pulled into little me.
[02:44:29.403 --> 02:44:32.906]  In other words, you don't get pulled into computer level of perception.
[02:44:32.906 --> 02:44:33.326]  That's it!
[02:44:33.326 --> 02:44:34.226]  I've got to stop you!
[02:44:34.226 --> 02:44:34.867]  Exactly!
[02:44:36.465 --> 02:44:42.366]  Whenever I'm calm, focused, I can think a thousand times faster, everything makes complete sense.
[02:44:42.366 --> 02:45:01.730]  By the very nature of getting on the air, having the lights on, having the stress of having to perform, I shift in to the, you know, fight or flight, into the reptilian brain, and then lose so much of my consciousness just even when I get on air, instead of like at 10 or 11, 12 at night, when everything is so clear.
[02:45:03.823 --> 02:45:12.192]  It's just amazing, but what you just talked about, whenever I get above it all, then I don't hate my enemies that are attacking me and lying about me.
[02:45:12.192 --> 02:45:15.075]  I actually feel sorry for them and wish that they weren't.
[02:45:16.038 --> 02:45:31.842]  You know, it's such a primitive level, but then I also realized we can't do like some people in the East that get so into higher awareness that they stop caring even if their body's dying or they're sitting there homeless under a tree.
[02:45:31.842 --> 02:45:35.343]  We have to have balance between the two levels because
[02:45:37.566 --> 02:45:46.509]  If people lose the will to even survive at this plane of existence, then that I see also as a great danger.
[02:45:46.509 --> 02:45:47.430]  Here's an example.
[02:45:47.430 --> 02:45:49.730]  You spray cockroaches with poison.
[02:45:49.730 --> 02:45:52.451]  Any exterminator will tell you this.
[02:45:52.451 --> 02:45:54.592]  As soon as they get hit by poison, they start having sex.
[02:45:57.554 --> 02:45:59.334]  To fertilize their eggs.
[02:45:59.334 --> 02:46:02.555]  And it's just like after 9-11, there was a huge baby boom.
[02:46:02.555 --> 02:46:07.056]  That was, the establishment did a threat to the species grand event.
[02:46:07.056 --> 02:46:08.996]  Oh, our tribe just got devastated.
[02:46:08.996 --> 02:46:13.937]  People immediately, myself included, went and got married, started having children, not even knowing why.
[02:46:13.937 --> 02:46:19.358]  It was a compulsion of the species, which are all interconnected and tied together, you know.
[02:46:19.358 --> 02:46:24.299]  We're all individuals, but we're also part of a hive species, almost like a jellyfish colony.
[02:46:24.299 --> 02:46:24.759]  And so,
[02:46:26.246 --> 02:46:28.507]  I mean, David, I'm throwing out a lot of ideas here.
[02:46:28.507 --> 02:46:46.997]  The point I'm trying to make is that we can also, and I haven't done this consciously, but now that I'm more conscious I can realize I did, I've been successful with people waking them up to the first level because I did at a reptilian primitive level explain you have been enslaved.
[02:46:46.997 --> 02:46:52.160]  There is more outside this system than you know, but then now more and more I realize
[02:46:52.600 --> 02:47:10.130]  That when you do open up the entire universe and the majesty of the clouds and the stars and life and that your soul is looking out these windows and when I look at another person, I'm looking at another soul and their entire genetic line and all those levels, almost like a symbiotic organism is what I'm beginning to realize we are.
[02:47:13.172 --> 02:47:16.194]  It's so incredible to open up to the entire universe, and I agree with you.
[02:47:16.194 --> 02:47:20.256]  When you open up to that, then you realize how ridiculous the New World Order is.
[02:47:20.256 --> 02:47:32.903]  But still, they are physically at this level hurting people, and it's a test for the higher level to come down into the lower level and deal with this, because almost when you get tied into the higher level, you don't even want to be part of the world anymore.
[02:47:32.903 --> 02:47:38.506]  But it's almost like God sending Christ down to the earth to experience this in the flesh.
[02:47:38.506 --> 02:47:40.047]  So, do you understand what I'm saying, David?
[02:47:40.888 --> 02:47:44.570]  Well, you know, I don't think we come into this world to then ignore the fact we've done so.
[02:47:44.570 --> 02:47:46.910]  This is why we need the balance.
[02:47:46.910 --> 02:48:00.156]  You've got people like what's called the New Age Movement and much of that was brilliantly described in a book I read a long time ago as people who were in a holding pattern above the airport refusing to land.
[02:48:00.156 --> 02:48:07.419]  And there's a lot of people that are in denial of what
[02:48:08.079 --> 02:48:08.640]  Thank you very much.
[02:48:18.163 --> 02:48:22.826]  What we need to do is bring that higher awareness into the body computer.
[02:48:22.826 --> 02:48:33.073]  Because, you know, they can manipulate and program the body computer through the media, through education, through electrochemical means, and they do all the time.
[02:48:33.073 --> 02:48:34.114]  That's the bottom line.
[02:48:34.114 --> 02:48:40.698]  So we have to occupy the reptilian brain with the higher consciousness, or they're always going to use it as a breach.
[02:48:41.058 --> 02:48:49.246]  The point I'm making here, Alex, is we can program the computer from consciousness, if consciousness is allowed in.
[02:48:49.246 --> 02:48:50.427]  And what does that mean?
[02:48:50.427 --> 02:48:51.668]  It means opening the mind.
[02:48:51.668 --> 02:49:01.217]  A key thing I would say is that from the words that I, the terms I'm using anyway, the mind and consciousness are not the same thing.
[02:49:01.217 --> 02:49:03.039]  The mind is like a
[02:49:04.091 --> 02:49:05.893]  It's like an interface.
[02:49:05.893 --> 02:49:11.699]  You see, I'm sitting here now in an office, and if I want to go on the internet, I can't just go on the internet.
[02:49:11.699 --> 02:49:14.722]  I've got to go on the internet through a computer.
[02:49:14.722 --> 02:49:15.823]  That's my interface.
[02:49:15.823 --> 02:49:19.828]  That allows me to experience the collective reality we call the World Wide Web.
[02:49:20.408 --> 02:49:30.496]  However, when I'm a consciousness, soul, whatever you want to talk about it, and I want to experience and make a contribution to this reality, I need an interface.
[02:49:30.496 --> 02:49:32.197]  And that interface is mind.
[02:49:32.197 --> 02:49:36.821]  And the mind is fundamentally part of the body-computer system, body-mind.
[02:49:36.821 --> 02:49:39.283]  They are different facets of each other.
[02:49:39.283 --> 02:49:44.207]  And what the Illuminati are about is programming the mind.
[02:49:44.207 --> 02:49:46.368]  And you talked earlier about
[02:49:48.280 --> 02:50:05.067]  The way that people are using fewer and fewer words and are speaking slower and all the rest of it, this is all part of programming people's not just ability to express themselves in words but their ability to express even their thoughts.
[02:50:05.587 --> 02:50:11.489]  See, on the level of consciousness, we become aware through something called knowing.
[02:50:11.489 --> 02:50:12.769]  Don't think it, know it.
[02:50:12.769 --> 02:50:18.551]  Consciousness knows because it is the one consciousness, the all that is.
[02:50:18.551 --> 02:50:23.133]  The mind, the body-mind-computer system, that thinks.
[02:50:23.133 --> 02:50:30.495]  That's the blimmin' chatter that goes on in your head 24-7 and never shuts up and says stupid things.
[02:50:30.495 --> 02:50:31.756]  And you think, why am I thinking that?
[02:50:31.756 --> 02:50:32.916]  Well, you're not actually thinking it.
[02:50:32.916 --> 02:50:33.857]  The body-computer is.
[02:50:35.237 --> 02:50:37.939]  That is, it thinks in words.
[02:50:37.939 --> 02:50:39.420]  It, you know, think now.
[02:50:39.420 --> 02:50:42.182]  Anybody listen to this show and you're thinking in words.
[02:50:42.182 --> 02:50:54.249]  The more you remove words, generation after generation, detailed words that can express a real detailed thought, you're, you're removing the ability even to think in detail.
[02:50:54.249 --> 02:50:58.632]  Because these are symbols used in the brain to construct that mental image.
[02:50:58.632 --> 02:51:00.213]  We'll be right back with David Icke.
[02:51:00.213 --> 02:51:01.054]  Pretty powerful stuff.
[02:51:01.846 --> 02:51:05.368]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:51:05.368 --> 02:51:10.772]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:51:10.772 --> 02:51:15.735]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:51:15.735 --> 02:51:26.703]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[02:51:26.983 --> 02:51:32.725]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[02:51:32.725 --> 02:51:38.967]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:51:38.967 --> 02:51:39.828]  What about you?
[02:51:39.828 --> 02:51:41.748]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[02:51:41.748 --> 02:51:44.569]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[02:52:01.707 --> 02:52:03.229]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:52:03.229 --> 02:52:08.614]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[02:52:08.614 --> 02:52:11.016]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[02:52:11.016 --> 02:52:20.145]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by calling the bailout grid.
[02:52:20.165 --> 02:52:20.645]  I think?
[02:52:50.145 --> 02:52:50.345]  We're good.
[02:53:01.693 --> 02:53:04.035]  This is Alex Jones for American Tax Settlement.
[02:53:04.035 --> 02:53:13.562]  We have received news that the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements on back taxes, and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of dollars.
[02:53:13.562 --> 02:53:21.569]  If any of you out there owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, we have created an open phone line with American Tax Settlement.
[02:53:21.569 --> 02:53:27.514]  For all Alex Jones listeners to see if you qualify for a settlement with the IRS to save thousands, the number to call is 1-800.
[02:53:28.354 --> 02:53:28.934]  We're good to go.
[02:53:49.939 --> 02:53:54.104]  If you owe $10,000 or more in taxes to the IRS, the number to call is 1-800-506-5904.
[02:53:54.104 --> 02:53:54.384]  That's 1-800-506-5904.
[02:53:54.384 --> 02:53:55.145]  Call today.
[02:53:55.145 --> 02:53:56.726]  It's always amazing having David Aikman.
[02:54:12.790 --> 02:54:15.237]  During the break, we were having an amazing behind-the-scenes discussion.
[02:54:15.237 --> 02:54:17.283]  Perhaps we can relay that.
[02:54:17.283 --> 02:54:20.131]  Coming up in the next hour, we'll open the phones up specifically for David Icke.
[02:54:21.510 --> 02:54:29.296]  I want to respect our guests, so if you're calling about something else, please call another day.
[02:54:29.296 --> 02:54:29.996]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:54:29.996 --> 02:54:31.117]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:54:31.117 --> 02:54:41.705]  I hope folks will go to InfoWars.com and support the broadcast by purchasing books and videos from the online store so that we can continue the fight to unlock minds and get people to think for themselves.
[02:54:41.705 --> 02:54:43.606]  All I want to do is take blinders off people.
[02:54:43.606 --> 02:54:45.728]  I don't claim they're going to see what I see.
[02:54:45.728 --> 02:54:47.149]  I don't claim I have all the answers.
[02:54:47.149 --> 02:54:47.830]  I just know this.
[02:54:48.670 --> 02:54:52.479]  Consciousness, this universe, is unbelievable.
[02:54:52.479 --> 02:54:54.384]  I mean, I just literally commune with it.
[02:54:54.384 --> 02:54:57.711]  It is so... Every moment is exhilarating, and it's torture!
[02:54:58.922 --> 02:55:05.146]  To be here and to have to focus on the New World Order and deal with it, but at the same time, we are never going to defeat these people.
[02:55:05.146 --> 02:55:13.511]  As David said during the break to me, he said, Alex, we've got to go into this world, we've got to be of this world, in the world but not of it.
[02:55:13.511 --> 02:55:17.794]  And we've got to be able to be in this world, be able to get people by the hand and pull them out of it.
[02:55:17.794 --> 02:55:19.075]  And does that mean we're perfect?
[02:55:19.075 --> 02:55:19.235]  No!
[02:55:19.975 --> 02:55:22.457]  We're just aware there's something else.
[02:55:22.457 --> 02:55:24.498]  And as I said, knowing is half the battle.
[02:55:24.498 --> 02:55:26.940]  But don't forget the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[02:55:26.940 --> 02:55:34.005]  If you want to get the Obama deception, if you want to get Truth Rising or any of the books and films we carry, Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:55:34.005 --> 02:55:38.608]  Be sure and peruse that while you're at it.
[02:55:38.608 --> 02:55:40.750]  Also, folks, you can peruse DavidIke.com.
[02:55:40.750 --> 02:55:48.095]  A lot of really interesting, mind-blowing stuff from one of the great philosophers and minds of our day, David Ike.
[02:55:48.635 --> 02:55:49.396]  Yeah, well, my journey is...
[02:56:03.867 --> 02:56:27.652]  Over the last 20 years has, you know, gone through so many levels with all the five cents manipulation of engineered wars and banking scams and all the rest of it and then into deeper areas and there's come a point, you know, every day at the moment is a joy as I'm writing this because the insights are just coming so fast because you reach a point where
[02:56:28.707 --> 02:56:48.150]  So many dots start to connect on all these different levels and you start to see how deep the rabbit hole really goes and what's good about it is it's not just that it shows you how they manipulate us, it shows you how we can stop them manipulating us and how we can take power over our reality back.
[02:56:48.750 --> 02:56:48.950]  I think?
[02:57:07.501 --> 02:57:10.522]  The Illuminati is not like a fly on the elephant's back.
[02:57:10.522 --> 02:57:16.565]  So we let consciousness in by opening our minds, and bingo, things start to change massively.
[02:57:16.565 --> 02:57:17.826]  The world starts to change.
[02:57:17.826 --> 02:57:20.447]  Because the world is a reflection of us.
[02:57:20.447 --> 02:57:31.532]  And at the moment, because we constantly give our power away, we constantly think in terms of little me, we live in a world in which the mass of the population constantly has no power and sees itself as little me.
[02:57:31.532 --> 02:57:33.573]  When we change that self-perception,
[02:57:34.273 --> 02:57:34.553]  Absolutely.
[02:57:56.187 --> 02:58:04.169]  I don't believe that we are in a physical matrix living in little tanks with, you know, reptoid robots running around all over us.
[02:58:04.169 --> 02:58:14.591]  But that came from 1968 government documents declassified in 2000, and clearly those movies came out before that, and so they were having the information fed to them.
[02:58:14.591 --> 02:58:17.312]  That is what the Pentagon says they want to build.
[02:58:17.312 --> 02:58:23.513]  Because for a control freak, somebody from the reptilian level, if everybody is encased in styrofoam for their own safety,
[02:58:24.153 --> 02:58:31.815]  Having perception fed to them through a wire, then that's not tyranny, that's just another reality.
[02:58:31.815 --> 02:58:34.556]  So I want to elaborate on this idea when we come back.
[02:58:34.556 --> 02:58:35.577]  Okay.
[02:58:35.577 --> 02:58:39.518]  Whereas we are in a matrix in that our brain is perceiving all this.
[02:58:39.518 --> 02:58:43.199]  Stay with us.
[02:58:43.199 --> 02:58:45.800]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:51.334 --> 02:59:00.419]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[02:59:00.419 --> 02:59:05.602]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[02:59:05.602 --> 02:59:08.164]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals
[02:59:08.584 --> 02:59:10.645]  Actually results in disease.

[02:59:54.273 --> 02:59:56.655]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.655 --> 02:59:59.457]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:11.318 --> 03:00:12.899]  What are you?
[03:00:12.899 --> 03:00:20.085]  You are a species that lives on a planet two-thirds of the way out on the spiral arm of what we call the Milky Way Galaxy.
[03:00:20.085 --> 03:00:30.613]  We're in a now eight planet, they don't count Pluto, but a nine planet solar system orbiting a very average sun.
[03:00:30.613 --> 03:00:34.116]  And what we know of our history probably has no reflection to the truth.
[03:00:37.725 --> 03:00:43.868]  We have a sense of ourselves as very important and of having an ancient history.
[03:00:43.868 --> 03:00:53.292]  We have a, you know, they call it delusions of grandeur, but really it's a sense of wonderment as being part of an infinite universe.
[03:00:53.292 --> 03:00:55.053]  And they want to narrow our perception.
[03:00:55.053 --> 03:00:59.215]  They want to keep us small and focused and fearful and petty.
[03:00:59.215 --> 03:01:05.338]  Because then when we're focused in on that, we don't see the wider universe and we're basically in change.
[03:01:05.338 --> 03:01:05.498]  So,
[03:01:06.755 --> 03:01:07.635]  I'm sure David's seen these.
[03:01:07.635 --> 03:01:12.037]  It's in my book, Descent into Tyranny, but I know he's seen thousands of documents and articles.
[03:01:12.037 --> 03:01:17.299]  I mentioned a few stories to him during a break, and he was aware of all of them we're going to talk about later.
[03:01:17.299 --> 03:01:28.844]  Dealing with why he can't really go to Canada and why I can't, but side issue, trying to bring in this physical tyranny so they can bring in the drug tyranny, the brainwashing tyranny to affect the mind that's really in the prison.
[03:01:30.282 --> 03:01:32.463]  So they're bringing in a physical prism but also a mental prism.
[03:01:32.463 --> 03:01:49.027]  But David, we really are in a matrix of perception when we realize it is a brain with all these multifaceted layers and that our eyes are just brain stems looking out at this small spectrum of reality as you say and others say.
[03:01:50.157 --> 03:01:51.898]  And so it's competing matrices.
[03:01:51.898 --> 03:01:57.762]  Either we take control of the matrix, or the establishment takes control of the matrix.
[03:01:57.762 --> 03:02:01.264]  And because we've not been aware of the matrix, they are in control of it.
[03:02:01.264 --> 03:02:02.625]  Is that what you're saying?
[03:02:02.625 --> 03:02:05.006]  Well, what I would say is this.
[03:02:05.006 --> 03:02:13.592]  You know, there's been many scientists over the years who've speculated that this reality needs an observer to be as we perceive it.
[03:02:14.518 --> 03:02:20.501]  And I would say they were absolutely right, and the evidence is overwhelming that that's true.
[03:02:20.501 --> 03:02:33.548]  If you think of radio stations and television stations, and you tune the radio to a certain station, that's the station you get.
[03:02:33.548 --> 03:02:34.629]  So if you want to control
[03:02:35.445 --> 03:02:47.399]  The sense of perception and the experience and daily life of a symbolic radio, then you need to control what it's tuned to.
[03:02:48.428 --> 03:02:56.214]  And we are constantly receiving and transmitting information through the body computer.
[03:02:56.214 --> 03:03:04.281]  This is why, you know, it's massively a crystalline entity, organism, because it's a receiver transmitter of information.
[03:03:04.281 --> 03:03:06.743]  The DNA is a receiver transmitter.
[03:03:06.743 --> 03:03:10.586]  Every cell, and we have trillions of them, have receiver transmitters.
[03:03:10.586 --> 03:03:12.067]  We're a receiver transmitter
[03:03:13.694 --> 03:03:15.415]  Extraordinaire.
[03:03:15.415 --> 03:03:24.062]  But, as with the radio, if you can control what it receives, you're controlling what it perceives.
[03:03:24.062 --> 03:03:41.777]  And all the time, we are being bombarded with programs that dictate the way the body computer reads and decodes reality, because this universe that we see as solid and physical only exists in our head when it's decoded.
[03:03:42.569 --> 03:03:50.572]  It's exactly the same principle as playing software on a computer, and it reads the software.
[03:03:50.572 --> 03:03:55.614]  Now, the software has no pictures on it, it has no websites on it, it has no text on it.
[03:03:55.614 --> 03:03:57.095]  It's just information.
[03:03:57.095 --> 03:04:08.139]  But the computer reads that information and projects it on the screen as words, pictures, websites, a collective reality we call the internet or whatever else is on the disc.
[03:04:10.241 --> 03:04:12.424]  That's what we're doing.
[03:04:12.424 --> 03:04:15.749]  The prime level of this matrix is
[03:04:16.568 --> 03:04:17.649]  Vibrational.
[03:04:17.649 --> 03:04:26.094]  This is why if you look at absolutely anything, no matter how solid it is, through a powerful enough microscope, you'll see vibrating energy.
[03:04:26.094 --> 03:04:35.380]  If you look at the inside of atoms, which are supposed to be the solid things, if you like, that make up the solid world, they have no solidity.
[03:04:35.380 --> 03:04:41.404]  The deeper and deeper you go into them, eventually it becomes just space, or empty space, or what we perceive as empty space.
[03:04:41.404 --> 03:04:43.566]  So what the body computer is doing,
[03:04:44.429 --> 03:04:54.281]  ...through the five senses is turning that vibrational information into electrical information which is transmitted to the brain that constructs that information into this holographic reality.
[03:04:54.281 --> 03:04:56.403]  It's like a computer reading the internet.
[03:04:56.403 --> 03:04:57.304]  All right, David, stay there.
[03:04:57.304 --> 03:04:57.725]  Got a break.
[03:04:57.725 --> 03:04:58.726]  Long segment coming up.
[03:04:58.726 --> 03:05:00.929]  This is very important information.
[03:05:01.249 --> 03:05:07.114]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[03:05:07.114 --> 03:05:08.415]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[03:05:08.415 --> 03:05:12.678]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called InnerFood.
[03:05:12.678 --> 03:05:14.540]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[03:05:14.540 --> 03:05:20.865]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded InnerFood his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[03:05:21.986 --> 03:05:24.867]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[03:05:24.867 --> 03:05:26.588]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[03:05:26.588 --> 03:05:29.608]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[03:05:29.608 --> 03:05:31.309]  And their formula really works.
[03:05:31.309 --> 03:05:34.130]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[03:05:34.130 --> 03:05:35.630]  Try the NutriCafe.
[03:05:35.630 --> 03:05:40.392]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[03:05:40.392 --> 03:05:42.813]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[03:05:42.813 --> 03:05:45.274]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[03:05:45.274 --> 03:05:47.374]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[03:05:47.374 --> 03:05:48.475]  Go to www.
[03:05:58.320 --> 03:06:06.544]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:06:06.544 --> 03:06:10.266]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:06:10.586 --> 03:06:11.266]  Number 2.
[03:06:11.266 --> 03:06:16.469]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:06:16.469 --> 03:06:17.110]  It's true.
[03:06:17.110 --> 03:06:21.552]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:06:21.552 --> 03:06:22.453]  Number 3.
[03:06:22.453 --> 03:06:27.916]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[03:06:27.916 --> 03:06:28.757]  Number 4.
[03:06:28.757 --> 03:06:31.658]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[03:06:31.658 --> 03:06:35.320]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:06:35.320 --> 03:06:36.181]  Number 5.
[03:06:36.181 --> 03:06:39.783]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[03:06:40.023 --> 03:06:45.750]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[03:06:45.750 --> 03:06:50.455]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:06:50.455 --> 03:06:52.237]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:06:52.237 --> 03:06:54.800]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[03:07:02.529 --> 03:07:17.898]  An important product from hempusa.org, micro plant powder, will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins, such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[03:07:17.898 --> 03:07:19.319]  Micro plant powder is 89% silica.
[03:07:20.860 --> 03:07:21.621]  We're good to go!
[03:07:46.135 --> 03:07:47.896]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.895 --> 03:08:20.436]  Your calls are coming up with David Icke.
[03:08:20.436 --> 03:08:22.518]  He's been very, very nice to give us two hours today.
[03:08:22.518 --> 03:08:23.339]  We're very, very thankful.
[03:08:23.339 --> 03:08:28.283]  We'll tell you about some of the speaking engagements that are coming up here in just a moment, so get your pen and paper ready.
[03:08:28.283 --> 03:08:30.584]  We're talking to the folks involved with the 2012 film.
[03:08:30.584 --> 03:08:31.445]  That's all I can say.
[03:08:31.445 --> 03:08:38.190]  I'm not even allowed to show the revision numbers of this, but I have the 2012 script with Woody Harrelson.
[03:08:38.190 --> 03:08:39.051]  I will just tell you that.
[03:08:39.051 --> 03:08:39.932]  That just came in the mail.
[03:08:39.932 --> 03:08:41.853]  I want to thank folks for that.
[03:08:41.853 --> 03:08:42.754]  Also want to thank
[03:08:43.885 --> 03:08:53.563]  People for this, Bob in Spokane, Washington said, God bless you Alex Jones, I thought of you.
[03:08:54.758 --> 03:09:00.082]  And what you do, the Info Warrior, I'm an Info Warrior myself.
[03:09:00.082 --> 03:09:02.003]  I hear you talk about the tip of the spear.
[03:09:02.003 --> 03:09:04.144]  This is a real Indian spear.
[03:09:04.144 --> 03:09:05.845]  And I had to give it to you.
[03:09:05.845 --> 03:09:08.087]  May God bless you and your family.
[03:09:26.379 --> 03:09:26.479]  It's
[03:09:44.625 --> 03:09:50.970]  You got cut off there talking about the frequency, talking about how the globalists, the controllers, keep us dialed into one point.
[03:09:50.970 --> 03:10:00.097]  How do you see their New World Order plan, their goals, to build this extermination grid, this planetary government, then carry out the population reduction?
[03:10:00.097 --> 03:10:06.883]  To me, it looks like things aren't going well for them, and we're having victory after victory, and that there's an awakening accelerating.
[03:10:06.883 --> 03:10:11.586]  Now, I know that they're going to counter-strike, and things are going to be rough, and we're all going to be tested.
[03:10:13.028 --> 03:10:24.975]  But am I somewhat, in your expert opinion, do you think I'm too close to the fact that we are going to win in the end and that I have a lot of faith because I'm deeper into this?
[03:10:24.975 --> 03:10:33.141]  And is that distorting my vision, in your opinion, that so many others aren't awake yet or are going deeper into the control?
[03:10:33.141 --> 03:10:40.906]  And so I'm skewing my view because I know the New World Order is already lost because they don't control the entire universe.
[03:10:40.906 --> 03:10:42.167]  I mean, do you get the point I'm making?
[03:10:42.787 --> 03:10:51.734]  Yeah, I've never doubted that it would turn out fine in the end, but the nature of the manipulation and the programming
[03:10:52.501 --> 03:10:58.604]  Means that a lot of people have got to go a long way down the road before they actually see it.
[03:10:58.604 --> 03:11:06.868]  And it's a case of how deeply programmed you are before you actually see it and start to realize what's happening.
[03:11:06.868 --> 03:11:14.853]  And what I've seen over the last 20 years is an exponential curve without any question of people who are starting to get it.
[03:11:14.853 --> 03:11:17.294]  They're starting to get it in bigger and bigger and bigger numbers.
[03:11:17.294 --> 03:11:21.296]  And what I find interesting is they're starting to get it at higher levels immediately.
[03:11:22.117 --> 03:11:22.557]  Yes.
[03:11:40.769 --> 03:11:51.017]  Name truth vibrations, because it was based on the fact that I was understanding at the time that there was a vibrational change coming that was going to act like an alarm clock.
[03:11:51.017 --> 03:11:52.178]  It was going to wake them up.
[03:11:52.178 --> 03:11:55.741]  It was going to tease open their minds so consciousness could enter.
[03:11:55.741 --> 03:11:59.404]  And at the time, of course, I'm thinking, well, there's no evidence of this whatsoever.
[03:11:59.404 --> 03:12:00.685]  And there wasn't for a few years.
[03:12:01.582 --> 03:12:07.105]  With the turn into the 21st century, I'm seeing it happening more and more and more.
[03:12:07.105 --> 03:12:08.105]  And it needs to happen.
[03:12:08.105 --> 03:12:11.467]  This is the way we're going to turn this around.
[03:12:11.467 --> 03:12:18.750]  But they're going to push it, obviously, as much as they can to get their structure in place.
[03:12:18.750 --> 03:12:23.212]  But I do sense a feeling of increasing panic, because
[03:12:23.892 --> 03:12:27.713]  Every day they take to do it, more and more people are waking up.
[03:12:27.713 --> 03:12:37.355]  And I'm very optimistic, not that there's not going to be some enormous, real big challenges to come, but I'm getting more and more optimistic.
[03:12:37.355 --> 03:12:43.076]  And you know, it's a phrase I use from time to time.
[03:12:43.076 --> 03:12:47.977]  Life tends to give us our greatest gifts brilliantly disguised as our worst nightmares.
[03:12:48.661 --> 03:12:58.250]  You know, sometimes what appears to be our worst nightmare turns out to be our greatest gift, like massive ridicule for me in the early 1990s right up to, you know, almost the year 2000.
[03:12:58.250 --> 03:13:08.900]  I went through incredible ridicule in Britain, but it set me free because it set me free of concern about what people thought of me, which allowed me to open my mind and allow consciousness in.
[03:13:08.900 --> 03:13:10.542]  And some of these challenges, you know,
[03:13:11.494 --> 03:13:12.515]  Which we don't like.
[03:13:12.515 --> 03:13:13.775]  I mean, who does?
[03:13:13.775 --> 03:13:18.638]  Are actually going to wake a lot of people up and set them free.
[03:13:18.638 --> 03:13:25.581]  There's a line in a song which goes, freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.
[03:13:25.581 --> 03:13:32.205]  And you know, when we think we've got something to lose, that reptilian brain survival mechanism is controlling us.
[03:13:32.205 --> 03:13:33.465]  Oh my goodness, yes, anything.
[03:13:33.465 --> 03:13:34.626]  I don't want to lose anything.
[03:13:35.146 --> 03:13:38.070]  But when you lose it, then you go, well, hold on a second.
[03:13:38.070 --> 03:13:39.311]  What have I actually lost?
[03:13:39.311 --> 03:13:40.272]  This is OK.
[03:13:40.272 --> 03:13:41.393]  I can deal with this.
[03:13:41.393 --> 03:13:42.695]  And actually, life's nicer.
[03:13:42.695 --> 03:13:53.307]  And it's funny that people... I talk to so many people who lived through the Second World War in Britain who say life was much nicer during the war, because people were nicer to each other and all the rest of it.
[03:13:53.307 --> 03:13:54.088]  They never had much.
[03:13:54.708 --> 03:13:56.931]  And they were helping each other because they never had much.
[03:13:56.931 --> 03:14:02.699]  In ways that as soon as the war was over, every man for himself, all that stopped, and my goodness me, as it stopped now.
[03:14:02.699 --> 03:14:05.924]  And it also made them enjoy things more because they had less.
[03:14:07.860 --> 03:14:13.926]  They smelled the roses because they didn't know how long the roses were going to be there to be smelled.
[03:14:13.926 --> 03:14:18.351]  There's so many challenges, Alex, and I've had some big ones in my life.
[03:14:18.351 --> 03:14:19.412]  We all have.
[03:14:19.412 --> 03:14:27.200]  When I look back, I think I didn't like it at the time, but I wouldn't change a thing because I am what I am, not despite that, but to a large extent because of it.
[03:14:27.640 --> 03:14:29.021]  Well, there's that.
[03:14:29.021 --> 03:14:46.790]  If we see that, if we experience these challenges from that perspective rather than, oh my god, reptilian brain, then not only are we going to get through them with less pain and all the rest of it, we're actually going to think straight in a way that's going to allow us to get through them in a much more effective way.
[03:14:46.790 --> 03:14:53.714]  Absolutely, and the point I was going to add is that so many people in these pyramidal power structures, and I'd like you to speak to this,
[03:14:54.924 --> 03:15:07.272]  They are just as imprisoned as lowly little minions of the system and more and more I'm talking to people who think of themselves as the elite and they're beginning to realize this is a prison.
[03:15:07.272 --> 03:15:11.194]  They're beginning to realize they're drinking sodium fluoride, their kids are drinking it.
[03:15:11.194 --> 03:15:21.700]  They're beginning to realize that this system affects everybody and they're beginning to realize that the television and the culture and the dumbing down is taking their children from them and
[03:15:23.021 --> 03:15:25.482]  Destroying their own destiny.
[03:15:25.482 --> 03:15:39.206]  So I'd like you to speak to that, and then I want to bring up Rolling Stone Magazine that I just happened to see laying there on the Commons table at the Emmes building where I was doing the Sunday radio show, syndicated show.
[03:15:39.206 --> 03:15:51.990]  I want to break this down, what Ray Kurzweil is saying, and we've got our vision of the future, liberty, freedom, you know, dynamic human spirit, a new renaissance, you know, to the power of a trillion, versus
[03:15:53.010 --> 03:15:57.833]  Versus their renaissance, a very dark renaissance in their own words.
[03:15:57.833 --> 03:16:01.975]  They just say that it's beautiful, but clearly it's quite ugly.
[03:16:01.975 --> 03:16:03.576]  But I mean, can you speak to the point I just made?
[03:16:05.211 --> 03:16:29.839]  This is a point I make as often as I can, because we go back to the sheep policing the herd, the sheep policing themselves, because when you're talking about people in full awareness of this agenda and in full support of advancing it, you're talking about a dramatically few people compared with the global population.
[03:16:30.299 --> 03:16:38.667]  We're certainly not looking at enough to administer the institutions of control that we see across global society.
[03:16:38.667 --> 03:16:45.694]  So you need people in your target population to do the administration for you.
[03:16:45.694 --> 03:16:48.938]  This is why when you look at the pyramid structure,
[03:16:49.538 --> 03:16:49.958]  I don't know.
[03:17:10.499 --> 03:17:25.346]  And they're like, who are administering this system, and are welded to it in terms of their subordination to it, or don't rock the boat, or don't step out of line, don't say anything.
[03:17:25.346 --> 03:17:29.587]  They get to dominate those under them, and they get dominated from those above them.
[03:17:29.587 --> 03:17:30.668]  It's a psycho system.
[03:17:30.888 --> 03:17:43.394]  Yes it is, and what we need to do, this is a very important area, is to get those people to actually, again, look around them, take a deep breath, and just look at it again.
[03:17:43.394 --> 03:17:48.737]  And by connecting dots, you can let people who are in
[03:17:48.897 --> 03:17:48.997]  No.
[03:18:19.117 --> 03:18:19.798]  We're good.
[03:18:34.312 --> 03:18:34.632]  I don't
[03:18:53.522 --> 03:18:55.564]  Let me throw a point in here, David.
[03:18:55.564 --> 03:18:55.844]  Exactly.
[03:18:55.844 --> 03:18:56.665]  Let me throw a point in.
[03:18:56.665 --> 03:18:59.727]  I mean, talk about how it's all a facade and all a matrix illusion.
[03:18:59.727 --> 03:19:12.297]  Look at the world banking system out of fiat currency with a handful of less than 15 families who rule the planet because they bought off governments to say that they issued the backing of the money.
[03:19:12.737 --> 03:19:25.378]  I mean, it's all just a fraud, and then out of that, what they're doing right now economically, trying to bankrupt things, so we have to depend on the state and have to be under their control, looks like a desperate gamble.
[03:19:25.891 --> 03:19:30.193]  Yeah, we have to say, we have to say, no, we're not building our own prison anymore.
[03:19:30.193 --> 03:19:32.494]  And then, something fantastic happens.
[03:19:32.494 --> 03:19:37.576]  We stop building our own prison, and the next thing is, the prison isn't being built, and there is no prison.
[03:19:37.576 --> 03:19:44.179]  Look how many people work for the banking system, and administer it, and make it happen, compared with the number of people that own it.
[03:19:44.179 --> 03:19:46.780]  It's fantastic.
[03:19:46.780 --> 03:19:50.862]  David Icke, let's come back, talk about solutions, and at the bottom of the hour, start taking phone calls.
[03:19:50.862 --> 03:19:51.963]  I'm also going to get into this.
[03:19:53.905 --> 03:19:56.829]  They say the elite are gonna live forever in Rolling Stone.
[03:19:56.829 --> 03:19:58.832]  Oh, I thought I heard that in Endgame.
[03:19:58.832 --> 03:19:59.613]  We'll break it down.
[03:19:59.613 --> 03:20:01.916]  ControlWars.com.
[03:20:01.916 --> 03:20:06.042]  Are you concerned about the current strain of influenza spreading across the U.S.?
[03:20:06.042 --> 03:20:09.787]  At the rate this new virus is spreading, it's not a matter of if, but when it will affect you.
[03:20:12.517 --> 03:20:12.937]  We're good to go.
[03:20:27.728 --> 03:20:30.010]  You need to visit WholeCure.com.
[03:20:30.010 --> 03:20:33.472]  WholeCure.com has flu survival packages starting at $24.95.

[03:20:47.982 --> 03:20:48.802]  That's W-H-O-L-E-C-U-R-E.
[03:20:59.169 --> 03:21:04.692]  It is a big idea.
[03:21:04.692 --> 03:21:06.373]  A new world order.
[03:21:06.373 --> 03:21:11.276]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:21:11.276 --> 03:21:14.117]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:21:14.117 --> 03:21:16.899]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:21:16.899 --> 03:21:19.300]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:21:20.072 --> 03:21:27.377]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:21:30.424 --> 03:21:35.868]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:21:35.868 --> 03:21:39.730]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:21:39.730 --> 03:21:42.292]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:21:42.292 --> 03:21:43.473]  Most people have no idea.
[03:21:43.473 --> 03:21:44.253]  They're not after money.
[03:21:44.253 --> 03:21:45.534]  They have all the money they need.
[03:21:45.534 --> 03:21:46.515]  They're after power.
[03:21:46.515 --> 03:21:47.656]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[03:21:47.656 --> 03:21:52.419]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[03:21:52.419 --> 03:21:56.381]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:21:56.381 --> 03:21:57.142]  Endgame.
[03:21:57.142 --> 03:21:59.183]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[03:21:59.183 --> 03:22:00.264]  You have been warned.
[03:22:01.241 --> 03:22:07.924]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[03:22:07.924 --> 03:22:16.027]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[03:22:16.027 --> 03:22:24.191]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[03:22:24.191 --> 03:22:28.953]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:22:29.293 --> 03:22:34.517]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[03:22:34.517 --> 03:22:38.860]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[03:22:38.860 --> 03:22:39.941]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:22:39.941 --> 03:22:44.464]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[03:22:44.464 --> 03:22:49.368]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[03:22:49.368 --> 03:22:52.350]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[03:22:52.350 --> 03:22:53.991]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:57.253 --> 03:23:00.835]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:23:00.835 --> 03:23:03.937]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[03:23:03.937 --> 03:23:09.461]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[03:23:09.461 --> 03:23:15.184]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:23:15.184 --> 03:23:16.665]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:23:16.665 --> 03:23:25.571]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[03:23:25.971 --> 03:23:27.813]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[03:23:27.813 --> 03:23:32.018]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[03:23:32.018 --> 03:23:37.044]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.

[03:23:40.888 --> 03:23:41.648]  Keep it natural.
[03:23:41.648 --> 03:23:50.353]  Call Calvin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[03:23:50.353 --> 03:23:54.535]  Try Calvin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[03:23:54.535 --> 03:23:55.836]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[03:24:09.927 --> 03:24:12.448]  What would the reptilian brain do?
[03:24:12.448 --> 03:24:22.471]  It knows that if it wipes out and kills all its competition, commits genocide, which we see ancient cultures doing to their neighbors over and over again, if you kill everybody, if you come in,
[03:24:23.251 --> 03:24:44.246]  To the promised land, or you're the Aztecs, you come into a Mayan area, and you kill everybody, or you're the Nazis, you're gonna go around the world and take over, have an administrative system, have carbon taxes, the Nazis propose similar taxes, and then have one-child policies, forced inoculations, soft kill.
[03:24:44.246 --> 03:24:48.168]  Then you kill everybody, except your people, then you win.
[03:24:49.639 --> 03:24:50.740]  That's the reptilian brain.
[03:24:50.740 --> 03:24:58.205]  But of course, then that idea continues, and the Nazis would have gone on forever, basically killing each other, just like the priest class were doing in Israel.
[03:24:58.205 --> 03:25:02.788]  Whenever they didn't have some new enemy to fight, they started pressing the tribes under them.
[03:25:02.788 --> 03:25:06.350]  This is just what human beings do over and over again.
[03:25:06.350 --> 03:25:09.452]  And here is Rolling Stone.
[03:25:09.452 --> 03:25:10.953]  And you open this up.
[03:25:10.953 --> 03:25:13.755]  I should have put a bookmark in here.
[03:25:13.755 --> 03:25:14.996]  And it's Ray Kurzweil.
[03:25:16.411 --> 03:25:29.662]  This is exactly what I said in Endgame, from his writings, and the UN's writings, and the Club of Rome's writings, and the World Transhumanist Society, and all the big billionaire tech owners.
[03:25:29.662 --> 03:25:33.605]  They go to big meetings, and I mean, it's everywhere.
[03:25:33.605 --> 03:25:39.991]  When man and machine merge, and it says, meet Ray Kurzweil, prophet of the techno-rapture.
[03:25:39.991 --> 03:25:42.713]  He's made billions of dollars, invented a bunch of computer systems.
[03:25:42.713 --> 03:25:43.353]  By 2045, he releases 2020.
[03:25:47.895 --> 03:25:50.257]  Computers will surpass us in intelligence.
[03:25:50.257 --> 03:25:55.380]  The universe itself will become conscious and humans will live forever.
[03:25:55.380 --> 03:26:00.803]  But when you actually read what Kurzweil says and what all the rest say, they say the elite are going to kill off the majority of us.
[03:26:00.803 --> 03:26:04.866]  They're going to merge with the silicon system that they call rational.
[03:26:04.866 --> 03:26:06.247]  It's the reptilian brain.
[03:26:06.247 --> 03:26:06.667]  Logic.
[03:26:06.667 --> 03:26:09.969]  They say it's logic that I kill all of you and then I win.
[03:26:09.969 --> 03:26:13.172]  They revel in mathematic equations.
[03:26:13.172 --> 03:26:14.953]  But really it's just cold-blooded wickedness.
[03:26:16.240 --> 03:26:18.023]  They would say there is no such thing as wicked.
[03:26:18.023 --> 03:26:19.105]  I am beyond good and evil.
[03:26:19.105 --> 03:26:20.308]  I'm going to kill you.
[03:26:20.308 --> 03:26:23.153]  Now this article doesn't get into all of that.
[03:26:23.153 --> 03:26:24.395]  It gets into some of it.
[03:26:24.395 --> 03:26:26.179]  Bill Joyce, while the future doesn't need us, does.
[03:26:27.076 --> 03:26:29.877]  But it gets into all the things Kurzweil invented and all the things he did.
[03:26:29.877 --> 03:26:33.979]  Molecular robots will spread through the tiniest recesses of all matter.
[03:26:33.979 --> 03:26:38.402]  Kurzweil predicts turning rocks into trees and living computers.
[03:26:38.402 --> 03:26:40.703]  We won't experience 100 years of progress in the 21st century.
[03:26:40.703 --> 03:26:43.564]  It'll be more like 20,000 years of progress.
[03:26:43.564 --> 03:26:46.086]  And he just says, oh, you won't take brain chips?
[03:26:46.086 --> 03:26:46.706]  It won't matter.
[03:26:46.706 --> 03:26:49.127]  The nanotech will instantly take you over.
[03:26:49.127 --> 03:26:52.089]  So they're saying resistance is futile.
[03:26:52.089 --> 03:26:54.830]  You don't have a choice.
[03:26:54.830 --> 03:26:56.311]  We are the final revolution.
[03:26:57.051 --> 03:27:00.453]  And then they put it in a liberal, sicky-feely packaging.
[03:27:00.453 --> 03:27:02.214]  What say you to this?
[03:27:02.214 --> 03:27:22.086]  Because when I read the real globalist documents, they say they're going to kill the majority of us because we don't deserve the life extension technology, and that if they can just be made to live to be 140 or so, people that are like 70 now, that then they'll have eternal lives as nanotech beings that will send their consciousness out as spores on the solar wind.
[03:27:22.086 --> 03:27:23.287]  I'm not saying this
[03:27:23.787 --> 03:27:26.969]  They're saying it, and they call us nuts, David Icke.
[03:27:26.969 --> 03:27:29.110]  This is what the world elite believe.
[03:27:29.110 --> 03:27:30.771]  This is their religion.
[03:27:30.771 --> 03:27:31.372]  What is this?
[03:27:32.697 --> 03:27:41.903]  Well, it's just a tantamount to the insanity that lies behind all that's happening.
[03:27:41.903 --> 03:27:48.528]  See, cleverness and wisdom are not the same thing, and in fact, cleverness without wisdom is the most destructive force on Earth.
[03:27:48.528 --> 03:28:02.237]  And they are, on a mind level, clever, but they are not wise, and that's why they're so destructive and devastatingly destructive in their potential to wreak havoc in even greater
[03:28:02.917 --> 03:28:03.538]  I don't think so.
[03:28:25.653 --> 03:28:26.013]  I think so.
[03:28:44.352 --> 03:28:44.672]  That's
[03:28:58.118 --> 03:28:59.599]  Working towards this for a long time.
[03:28:59.599 --> 03:29:03.380]  I mean, I've been talking about this nanotechnology, which are beyond microchips.
[03:29:03.380 --> 03:29:10.143]  You see, because the body is a biological computer, you can access it through technological means.
[03:29:10.143 --> 03:29:19.447]  This is what this whole thing about the computer brain interface is, where they're talking about putting a chip in the brain and then you can work your computer without using your hands.
[03:29:19.447 --> 03:29:23.809]  That's all because they're actually connecting two computers, one more fantastic than the other.
[03:29:23.809 --> 03:29:24.789]  Yes, but two computers.
[03:29:25.309 --> 03:29:36.261]  And so this nanotechnology takes on a completely new light when you realize that, because its ability to influence the body computer is fantastic, and that's the real level that they're operating on, the nano level.
[03:29:36.261 --> 03:29:38.183]  All right, long segment coming up.
[03:29:38.183 --> 03:29:39.285]  Take phone calls.
[03:29:39.285 --> 03:29:40.606]  Thirty minutes left with David Icke.
[03:29:40.606 --> 03:29:41.487]  DavidIcke.com.
[03:29:41.487 --> 03:29:45.211]  And David, tell me about your speaking engagements when we get back.
[03:29:45.211 --> 03:29:46.272]  Okay, folks, stay with us.

[03:32:03.335 --> 03:32:04.456]  Hi, this is Steve Schenke.
[03:32:09.082 --> 03:32:09.322]  I think so.
[03:32:32.526 --> 03:32:32.966]  I think so.
[03:33:17.566 --> 03:33:25.630]  We're going to do 5-10 minutes of overdrive today because I want to just sit back and let David Icke make his statement about where he sees the world's going.
[03:33:25.630 --> 03:33:32.054]  I have a bunch of other stuff I want to get to but I want to take your calls and time is running out and I got some sponsors I need to thank right now.
[03:33:32.054 --> 03:33:34.715]  So we'll go back to David Icke here in just one moment.
[03:33:34.715 --> 03:33:38.277]  First off, acolablue.com.
[03:33:38.277 --> 03:33:42.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, your body is a biological computer, an electrochemical computer.
[03:33:43.925 --> 03:33:52.876]  And the establishment, on record, is forcibly medicating us with Prozac, statins, on record, in the water supply.
[03:33:52.876 --> 03:33:54.478]  And sodium fluoride and the rest of it.
[03:33:55.748 --> 03:34:04.070]  Mokola Blue is a high-quality atmospheric water generator that grabs the water out of the air and puts it through reverse osmosis, carbon, UV filters, you name it.

[03:34:13.572 --> 03:34:13.632]  1-800-691-6043.
[03:34:22.557 --> 03:34:26.381]  Continuing, one of our other great sponsors that makes the show possible is Home Game.
[03:34:26.381 --> 03:34:29.464]  You can check out Max Little Orange Gorilla.
[03:34:29.464 --> 03:34:32.787]  Gorilla on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.

[03:35:07.020 --> 03:35:10.402]  And again, if you forget the address, Max the Little Orange Gorilla.
[03:35:10.402 --> 03:35:13.004]  And last sponsor of the day, My Solar Backup.
[03:35:13.004 --> 03:35:14.665]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[03:35:14.665 --> 03:35:16.426]  Hurricanes, snow, and ice storms.
[03:35:16.426 --> 03:35:19.469]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid, and here's a good way to do just that.
[03:35:19.469 --> 03:35:23.491]  A solar power generator is now available from our longtime sponsors, Solutions from Science.
[03:35:23.491 --> 03:35:27.654]  It's designed to provide 1,800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage.
[03:35:27.654 --> 03:35:35.540]  You get an emergency power backup kit, which consists of a power source, 1,800 power plant, a high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity,
[03:35:36.570 --> 03:35:43.116]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but in a blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[03:35:43.116 --> 03:35:46.358]  The solar generators, like having a silent power plant hidden in your home.
[03:35:46.358 --> 03:35:49.021]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[03:35:49.021 --> 03:35:52.744]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move now.

[03:35:57.348 --> 03:35:57.448]  877-327-0365.
[03:35:57.448 --> 03:35:57.828]  David Ike!
[03:36:04.656 --> 03:36:18.246]  Briefly getting back into this Ray Kurzweil stuff, I know you've read what the futurists, the transhumanists, and the eugenicists say, and you're right, they just say, well we're scientific, and we say that you have no right to the future and we're going to get rid of you.
[03:36:18.246 --> 03:36:23.330]  But then if you talk about going after them physically, they freak out and yell and scream and call SWAT teams on you.
[03:36:23.330 --> 03:36:29.315]  So really it's just a cold-blooded, as we say, and again, reptiles are cold-blooded, the reptilian brain,
[03:36:30.734 --> 03:36:38.916]  This is a cold-blooded idea and system and they sit there like our opinions don't even matter but that's a mind game.
[03:36:38.916 --> 03:36:40.477]  We do have force of will.
[03:36:40.477 --> 03:36:47.459]  We can stand up to them and they're scared of us having that purpose and deciding we're not listening to their propaganda.
[03:36:47.459 --> 03:36:48.419]  We are warm-blooded.
[03:36:48.999 --> 03:37:06.924]  We do have red blood, and we're marching against their tyranny, whatever the cost, because humanity's future depends on it not being captured by a group of predatory homo sapiens sapiens who are acting like vampires.
[03:37:06.924 --> 03:37:11.605]  Yeah, the thing is, Alex, that what they're terrified of more than anything else is
[03:37:12.429 --> 03:37:17.652]  People becoming conscious beyond mind and beyond the computer level of perception.
[03:37:17.652 --> 03:37:26.096]  You can see in their own writings how they use phrases like, you know, in my words, they're terrified of mavericks.
[03:37:26.096 --> 03:37:29.238]  Mavericks are people that could bring the whole thing down.
[03:37:29.238 --> 03:37:30.199]  And what are mavericks?
[03:37:30.199 --> 03:37:36.262]  Mavericks are people who are not programmed, who are not following secular ritual behavior and responses and reactions.
[03:37:36.682 --> 03:37:37.323]  We're good to go.
[03:37:57.127 --> 03:38:11.338]  Trying to program the computer and trying to destabilize the computer, because all this stuff with fluoride and aspartame and all these other electrochemical sources of disruption, they're there to literally put viruses in the computer.
[03:38:11.338 --> 03:38:14.380]  And when you put viruses in your laptop computer, what happens?
[03:38:14.380 --> 03:38:15.982]  It stops working properly.
[03:38:15.982 --> 03:38:17.243]  It stops thinking straight.
[03:38:17.243 --> 03:38:19.304]  It stops operating to full potential.
[03:38:19.304 --> 03:38:20.545]  That's the idea.
[03:38:20.545 --> 03:38:22.527]  But when consciousness enters the body,
[03:38:23.956 --> 03:38:29.557]  It can overpower those programs and it can overpower those effects on the body.
[03:38:29.557 --> 03:38:48.062]  I remember a story illustrates what I'm talking about when there was one of these Eastern Mystic guys who was being used as part of an LSD experiment when they were experimenting in the 60s with LSD and some professor was over trying to see the effects on people.
[03:38:48.062 --> 03:38:52.163]  And he gave this guy a dose of LSD which should have blown his mind.
[03:38:52.823 --> 03:38:53.463]  Nothing happened.
[03:38:53.463 --> 03:38:54.904]  The guy smiled at him.
[03:38:54.904 --> 03:39:04.127]  He then doubled the dose eventually and the guy still smiled at him and there was no effects of the LSD on this guy whatsoever.
[03:39:04.127 --> 03:39:04.367]  Why?
[03:39:04.367 --> 03:39:09.649]  Because the guy was conscious and through consciousness it overpowered the effect of the drug.
[03:39:09.649 --> 03:39:11.350]  And that's just an illustration of how
[03:39:12.361 --> 03:39:23.588]  When we're conscious, we can overpower all these attacks on the body, and we can see, from a consciousness point of view, blatant means of manipulation.
[03:39:23.588 --> 03:39:26.289]  And that's what these guys are terrified of.
[03:39:26.289 --> 03:39:32.473]  And I mean terrified, because when humanity becomes conscious, their game is over.
[03:39:32.473 --> 03:39:34.014]  It's like we talked about last time in the
[03:39:34.875 --> 03:39:47.958]  The movie with the grasshoppers, where he said about the ants, if they work out that there's loads of them and a few of us, there goes our way of life.
[03:39:47.958 --> 03:39:50.378]  When we become conscious, there goes our way of life.
[03:39:50.378 --> 03:40:01.221]  And that's why they work so constantly and incessantly, through electrochemical means, through programming, through words and other means, through religious belief.
[03:40:02.562 --> 03:40:10.089]  And David, I mean, just to simplify it, by poisoning the higher brain, the higher levels, which is a physiological fact,
[03:40:23.533 --> 03:40:23.693]  Yeah.
[03:40:39.394 --> 03:40:39.594]  I think?
[03:40:59.472 --> 03:40:59.772]  Yeah.
[03:41:14.009 --> 03:41:17.030]  And it seems like it's accelerating right now, David.
[03:41:17.030 --> 03:41:26.613]  It was kind of freaking me out, because I wasn't on ACID, but it was almost like an ACID trip watching, and I was seeing other people that were noticing.
[03:41:26.613 --> 03:41:27.773]  Do you see the point I'm making?
[03:41:27.773 --> 03:41:30.394]  Well, the thing is, there is a parting of the ways here.
[03:41:30.394 --> 03:41:32.194]  I mean, I'm seeing it more and more.
[03:41:32.194 --> 03:41:41.077]  There are those that are becoming more and more programmed as the programming increases, and there's those that are becoming less and less programmed as their consciousness increases.
[03:41:41.497 --> 03:41:43.339]  It's very much a parting of the ways.
[03:41:43.339 --> 03:41:57.095]  There's two very different types of human being emerging which is becoming clearer and clearer by the week as the people become conscious and people, others, get caught more and more in the programming and become less and less.
[03:41:57.916 --> 03:41:59.057]  We're good to go.
[03:42:18.919 --> 03:42:38.786]  And you can get into it through words and basically it's a war on the human body computer receiver transmission system and it's much like a stage hypnotist who is planting beliefs into the stooges on the stage and a belief is like a computer program, it's like a piece of software because it
[03:42:40.572 --> 03:42:41.613]  It's a perception.
[03:42:41.613 --> 03:42:53.199]  We believe that the Federal Reserve isn't private, even though it is, so people think it's the government, and people will kill each other for a thousand dollars, and they're just making it zeros and ones on a computer.
[03:42:53.199 --> 03:42:53.979]  It's an illusion.
[03:42:53.979 --> 03:42:55.100]  It's a spell.
[03:42:55.100 --> 03:42:56.100]  Yeah, it's a spell, yeah.
[03:42:56.100 --> 03:43:04.865]  I mean, one of the areas of my talks is breaking the spell, and the key point I want to make here is it's not so much the reality
[03:43:05.789 --> 03:43:08.051]  It's how we perceive reality.
[03:43:08.051 --> 03:43:11.514]  That's the interface that they want to manipulate.
[03:43:11.514 --> 03:43:27.028]  I mean, we live in an infinite reality, but what they want to do is so program the receiver transmitter that reads reality in this five sense world, so that it reads reality to fit their agenda.
[03:43:27.028 --> 03:43:30.852]  It's not reality, it's the way we read it they want to manipulate.
[03:43:31.412 --> 03:43:39.140]  And basically, you know, you can have a hypnotist on a stage and he'll get someone to eat an apple, eat a potato, but taste an apple.
[03:43:39.140 --> 03:43:46.808]  And all he's doing is putting a belief, a program, a software into the brain so that when the electrical signal from the tongue...
[03:43:47.449 --> 03:43:48.750]  We're good to go.
[03:44:05.902 --> 03:44:22.405]  And that's what the New World Order is, is a mass hypnotist, as you're saying, and more and more I realize the cops, the government people, the New World Order people, you talk to a lot of them, and they are some of the blindest folks out there, and they're obsessive-compulsive, they're obsessed with
[03:44:23.446 --> 03:44:42.156]  Like you said, hierarchical systems, and they are completely reduced down to almost nothing, only getting that tiny bit of not even small spectrum of reality, false reality, fed into them, and then they arrange themselves in guilds.
[03:44:42.156 --> 03:44:52.341]  They're the delusional crazy people, because to me, crazy is denying what the full spectrum of reality is, telling us we're crazy, and they arrange themselves together above us.
[03:44:53.254 --> 03:45:07.906]  That is a very, very important point because what happens is that these training programs for people in uniform, for government administrators, and all the people that administer or law enforce the system,
[03:45:08.446 --> 03:45:18.550]  These training programs are designed to program these people to read reality as the system wants, which is to read the system's version of reality.
[03:45:18.550 --> 03:45:25.332]  There's an organization in this country, I'm sure you'll know of a number in America, called Common Purpose.
[03:45:25.332 --> 03:45:31.654]  Common Purpose started out with a person who works from the office of the Deputy Prime
[03:45:32.967 --> 03:45:39.610]  It's the local non-governmental and the government gives them all the power and it really is the government to run every county, every city, yeah.
[03:45:39.610 --> 03:45:56.039]  Yeah, what they're doing, what Common Purpose are doing, and Common Purpose means common reality, Common Purpose are going around and local government, police, health services, all these institutions of the state
[03:45:56.539 --> 03:45:56.999]  I think?
[03:46:11.724 --> 03:46:12.544]  Yeah, I think so.
[03:46:36.255 --> 03:46:41.196]  Possibly is going on in your head that you can see this situation is justified.
[03:46:41.196 --> 03:46:43.877]  But they do, because that's the way they're reading reality.
[03:46:43.877 --> 03:46:47.638]  They're automatons, and that's what these training programs are there to do.
[03:46:47.638 --> 03:46:54.820]  And these hypnotic techniques, much more advanced than what you see in the stage shows, are what these people are trained to do.
[03:46:54.820 --> 03:46:56.081]  Well, let me expand on that.
[03:46:56.841 --> 03:46:59.322]  Let me, and we're going to go to calls.
[03:46:59.322 --> 03:47:15.230]  They have made it now where the police follow ridiculous orders and enforce it on the people to set the precedent where then the craziness of cops, because an ambulance doesn't run, I mean, there's video of a cop car at 100 miles an hour flies up behind an ambulance.
[03:47:15.230 --> 03:47:17.231]  The ambulance doesn't even know it's there.
[03:47:17.231 --> 03:47:26.096]  It goes around the ambulance, then pulls the ambulance over and beats the guy up, and the cops then go to charge the guy they beat up on video who didn't touch him.
[03:47:26.596 --> 03:47:31.302]  And then the cops think that's normal now, that when they beat you up, they charge you.
[03:47:31.302 --> 03:47:32.524]  It's a cult!
[03:47:32.524 --> 03:47:39.052]  Like O'Brien's torturing Winston in 1984, and he says we're the priest of power.
[03:47:39.052 --> 03:47:42.137]  It's just raw reptilian exercise.
[03:47:42.677 --> 03:47:48.103]  And then now the CPS is grabbing everybody's kids for no reason and saying you can't raise your voice.
[03:47:48.103 --> 03:48:01.536]  They are the cult and they're giving new download programs every week now to their minions in the sensitivity training to get crazier and crazier ramping up towards some horrible future.
[03:48:01.536 --> 03:48:05.400]  Some horrid mass culling telling us torturing people's good.
[03:48:07.108 --> 03:48:22.717]  The point is here that we can talk about robots being made in the future and all the rest of it, but you take consciousness out of the human body and all you're left with is a biological computer, in effect a robot.
[03:48:22.717 --> 03:48:32.003]  And what they're doing is taking consciousness out through their manipulation techniques and leaving what is left, which is just a computer system.
[03:48:32.003 --> 03:48:32.483]  And what can
[03:48:32.483 --> 03:48:32.683]  And he's...
[03:48:56.772 --> 03:48:59.553]  And the establishment tests its biological androids.
[03:48:59.553 --> 03:49:03.893]  They're testing the police to say, okay, beat up ambulance drivers for no reason.
[03:49:03.893 --> 03:49:07.454]  Okay, taser somebody because they don't sign the ticket.
[03:49:07.454 --> 03:49:09.615]  And then next they'll do something even more outrageous.
[03:49:09.615 --> 03:49:26.418]  Can someone fully lose consciousness, you know, from the Christian perspective that I see it, that lose the soul, the ultimate sin, harden the heart, go so far that they become pure biological android vessels of the Hive program system?
[03:49:27.301 --> 03:49:35.484]  Yes, because, you know, everything's one consciousness, and you can't lose a connection to a higher consciousness.
[03:49:35.484 --> 03:49:38.084]  What you can lose is an awareness of it.
[03:49:38.084 --> 03:49:56.510]  And then, without that awareness, you act in the sense of the awareness that you're left with, which is a limited awareness that has a completely different perception of reality to what it would have if it was in its full level of awareness, which is what I call consciousness.
[03:49:56.812 --> 03:49:58.174]  And so they're damned!
[03:49:58.174 --> 03:50:05.246]  That'd be like if there was a dome city, hypothetically, two miles under my feet.
[03:50:05.246 --> 03:50:07.510]  I don't know it's there, therefore it doesn't exist.
[03:50:07.918 --> 03:50:14.101]  Yeah, the thing is that in an ideal world, you've got consciousness having experience through the physical body.
[03:50:14.101 --> 03:50:25.307]  So you're in this water and you're of it, or not of it, and the computer system and the mind, the interface, is fine.
[03:50:25.307 --> 03:50:32.831]  It's the means through which, like this computer in front of me, allows me to experience the collective reality we call the Internet.
[03:50:32.831 --> 03:50:35.313]  The key is when consciousness is
[03:50:35.933 --> 03:50:36.354]  We're good.
[03:50:50.228 --> 03:50:50.788]  Incredible.
[03:50:50.788 --> 03:50:53.290]  David's agreed to go 5-10 minutes into overdrive.
[03:50:53.290 --> 03:50:57.672]  We're going to come back in the final segment, and then in the overdrive we'll take the rest of the calls as well.
[03:50:57.672 --> 03:51:01.835]  Just mind-blowing, because as I research this, I'm finding out he's right.
[03:51:01.835 --> 03:51:08.079]  We are surrounded by harmful indoor air that can easily deliver many harmful toxins straight into our bodies.
[03:51:08.079 --> 03:51:09.860]  Take a deep breath.
[03:51:09.860 --> 03:51:16.403]  Can you actually feel the airborne influenza, viruses, mold, bacteria, and dangerous ozone entering your lungs?
[03:51:16.403 --> 03:51:17.924]  Have a glass of water.
[03:51:17.924 --> 03:51:18.985]  Can you taste the harmful
[03:51:18.985 --> 03:51:19.906]  We're good to go.
[03:51:45.742 --> 03:51:49.183]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.408 --> 03:52:14.291]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.291 --> 03:52:20.793]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:20.793 --> 03:52:22.754]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:22.754 --> 03:52:25.215]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[03:52:25.215 --> 03:52:36.100]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:52:38.408 --> 03:52:40.070]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.070 --> 03:52:41.932]  It's about a one world government.
[03:52:41.932 --> 03:52:48.839]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:48.839 --> 03:52:57.107]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:57.107 --> 03:52:58.688]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.688 --> 03:52:59.870]  The people strike back.
[03:53:01.971 --> 03:53:04.032]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[03:53:04.032 --> 03:53:06.972]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[03:53:06.972 --> 03:53:09.213]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[03:53:09.213 --> 03:53:10.193]  Here's the story.
[03:53:10.193 --> 03:53:14.975]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[03:53:14.975 --> 03:53:16.235]  Now here's the bad news.
[03:53:16.235 --> 03:53:19.516]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands.
[03:53:19.676 --> 03:53:20.076]  We're good to go.
[03:53:44.759 --> 03:53:49.922]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and it's flat out the best course of its kind.
[03:53:49.922 --> 03:53:54.044]  I recommend you visit this important new website at MakeHerbalMedicines.com.
[03:53:54.044 --> 03:53:56.825]  That's MakeHerbalMedicines.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[03:54:12.810 --> 03:54:20.812]  Well, an amazing interview with David Icke, and we're going to take some of your phone calls right now from Chris Tim, Aria, Ryan, Tim Leo.
[03:54:20.812 --> 03:54:28.174]  In fact, Aria, Ryan, Tim Leo, and others have been given the number 888-201-2244 to take a few calls in overdrive with David Icke.
[03:54:28.174 --> 03:54:30.315]  But David's going to be speaking in Phoenix, October 17th.
[03:54:30.315 --> 03:54:39.477]  Details at DavidIcke.com, Phoenix, Arizona, and then Bellingham in between Seattle and Vancouver.
[03:54:41.292 --> 03:54:44.153]  And what date is that in Bellingham, David Icke?
[03:54:44.153 --> 03:54:45.313]  The 4th.
[03:54:45.313 --> 03:54:45.613]  October 4th.
[03:54:45.613 --> 03:54:47.994]  I was thinking all day on the Sunday, yeah.
[03:54:47.994 --> 03:54:52.175]  And folks better get tickets, because, I mean, don't you sell out every event you have?
[03:54:52.175 --> 03:54:57.057]  Well, that's been the case for a little while, yeah, because the interest is so fantastic.
[03:54:57.057 --> 03:55:05.339]  I mean, you know, after Phoenix and Bellingham, I'm doing Amsterdam just before them, and then I'm going to Gothenburg in Sweden, Athens, Greece, Zurich, Switzerland.
[03:55:05.339 --> 03:55:07.140]  I mean, the world is waking up, Alex.
[03:55:07.140 --> 03:55:07.940]  Hallelujah to that.
[03:55:08.479 --> 03:55:12.762]  Yeah, and I don't think the globalists can set off nukes and stage new wars and get away with it.
[03:55:12.762 --> 03:55:18.986]  I mean, I tell you, this is the great crossroads that we're certainly at right now.
[03:55:18.986 --> 03:55:22.789]  Chris in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead, welcome.
[03:55:22.789 --> 03:55:24.530]  Hey Alex, hey David.
[03:55:24.530 --> 03:55:28.873]  Chris had a question about what we see a lot lately, Bill.
[03:55:28.873 --> 03:55:30.995]  We are real obsessed and into the occult.
[03:55:31.836 --> 03:55:37.519]  And they've kind of been commercializing it, like with movies and with celebrities wearing, like, Kabbalah bracelets.
[03:55:37.519 --> 03:55:38.519]  You saw that for a while.
[03:55:38.519 --> 03:55:40.820]  It was a trend.
[03:55:40.820 --> 03:55:47.684]  There are big rituals, like aspects to 9-11 and Columbine and these types of things.
[03:55:47.684 --> 03:55:55.488]  Yes, they mainline it and then it's revelation of the method because, again, they're engaging in mass programming of the archetypal reptilian brain.
[03:55:56.628 --> 03:56:09.576]  That's exactly what they're doing, yeah, and other things too, because, again, it's important to stress that these people understand reality to a far greater extent than they allow the people to.
[03:56:09.576 --> 03:56:19.762]  You know, this is why they've destroyed ancient knowledge and destroyed ancient history and stuff like that, as much as they can, so they can replace it with their fake history.
[03:56:19.762 --> 03:56:24.865]  So we don't know, you know, where all this has come from, and it's very much more difficult to get a fix on where we are.
[03:56:25.525 --> 03:56:25.866]  Yes.
[03:56:25.866 --> 03:56:35.656]  And they understand reality and their rituals are designed to manipulate and program reality.
[03:56:35.656 --> 03:56:36.517]  That's why they do them.
[03:56:36.517 --> 03:56:45.846]  And people think of satanic rituals, you know, with people around a slab at an altar and my goodness do they go on and some of the most famous people in the world take part in them.
[03:56:45.846 --> 03:56:48.028]  But there are mass rituals too.
[03:56:48.889 --> 03:56:49.289]  I don't know.
[03:56:58.232 --> 03:57:03.477]  This reality, and even mainstream science is understanding this now, is digital.
[03:57:03.477 --> 03:57:08.321]  Another reason why I think it's highly significant to move over to digital television, personally.
[03:57:08.321 --> 03:57:24.094]  And it's numbers, it's mathematics, and so all this numerology and all these occult ritual codes that they use where they do things on a certain day, and you see 33s and 9-11s, these are all coming from a level of knowledge of how you can manipulate numbers.
[03:57:24.094 --> 03:57:25.075]  And let me throw this out.
[03:57:25.595 --> 03:57:30.456]  We got a break here and start the next hour, so let's get Tim to call in on the new line there, Tim in Ohio.
[03:57:30.456 --> 03:57:31.537]  But let me throw this out.
[03:57:31.537 --> 03:57:32.557]  The Aztecs did it.
[03:57:32.557 --> 03:57:36.278]  Why do separate human cultures that don't even know each other do the same thing?
[03:57:36.278 --> 03:57:37.758]  This is a system of control.
[03:57:37.758 --> 03:57:45.140]  The Romans wrote that they used the gladiatorial events where you would go like it was entertainment and watch your neighbor have his guts torn out.
[03:57:45.680 --> 03:57:51.385]  So a month later, when you were getting your guts torn out, your neighbor wouldn't stand up for you against the state.
[03:57:51.385 --> 03:57:56.009]  It's making a sport, like these cop shows, out of seeing the cops hunt us down.
[03:57:56.009 --> 03:58:00.693]  We're dehumanizing ourselves, so the ritual has a reason.
[03:58:00.693 --> 03:58:01.994]  There's a method to the madness.
[03:58:01.994 --> 03:58:03.155]  Is that what you're saying, David?
[03:58:03.155 --> 03:58:04.136]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:58:04.136 --> 03:58:10.081]  I mean, they are crazy, but they're very clever in the way that they use the knowledge they have.
[03:58:10.612 --> 03:58:14.795]  Crazy Like a Fox, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.

[03:58:26.543 --> 03:58:28.965]  He's coming to the United States to speak in October.
[03:58:28.965 --> 03:58:36.090]  We're going to break for one minute, say bye-bye to stations, come back in overdrive at PrisonPlanet.tv and the InfoWars.com streams.
[03:58:36.090 --> 03:58:38.152]  Great job to the crews, great job to everybody else.
[03:58:38.712 --> 03:58:40.393]  8-10 minutes overdrive right now.
[03:58:40.393 --> 03:58:43.954]  Here we go.

[03:58:51.618 --> 03:59:00.722]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[03:59:00.722 --> 03:59:05.885]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[03:59:05.885 --> 03:59:08.446]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals
[03:59:08.866 --> 03:59:10.927]  Actually results in disease.
[03:59:10.927 --> 03:59:19.989]  Go to AmericanSuperfoods.com today and see the wide range of foods available that were designed to help your mind and body work the way they were intended to.

[04:00:12.004 --> 04:00:22.631]  All right, we don't have a lot of time left with David Icke, so I want to go to your phone calls.
[04:00:22.631 --> 04:00:24.632]  That's the whole point of us going into overdrive.
[04:00:24.632 --> 04:00:32.677]  Next time I have him, I've got to just share him with a caller, but we just talk about so much and the nature of reality.
[04:00:32.677 --> 04:00:35.459]  Who's up first here, guys, on the phone system?
[04:00:39.020 --> 04:00:41.881]  I'm sorry, I can't hear that caller.
[04:00:41.881 --> 04:00:45.863]  Can't hear you guys either.
[04:00:45.863 --> 04:00:47.603]  Austin, can you hear me?
[04:00:47.603 --> 04:00:48.304]  Yes, I can, Gary.
[04:00:48.304 --> 04:00:49.244]  You're on the air with David Icke.
[04:00:49.244 --> 04:00:49.944]  Go ahead.
[04:00:49.944 --> 04:00:51.265]  Yeah, thank you both, Alex.
[04:00:51.265 --> 04:00:52.525]  You're doing an amazing job.
[04:00:52.525 --> 04:00:53.946]  I really appreciate what you're doing.
[04:00:53.946 --> 04:00:56.507]  David, it's great to hear you on the show.
[04:00:56.507 --> 04:00:58.588]  Really quick thing about chemtrails.
[04:00:58.588 --> 04:01:03.830]  We're seeing tons of them across America right now, and I went and did my research.
[04:01:03.830 --> 04:01:04.510]  Two questions.
[04:01:05.271 --> 04:01:08.694]  One, how can we make it more public?
[04:01:08.694 --> 04:01:12.376]  Because the media has ignored all my requests to take a look at it.
[04:01:12.376 --> 04:01:23.024]  And two, when I researched it, and I dug into the patent, the Hughes patent, they were going to use thorium oxide and aluminum oxide, and right now they're actually using barium oxide.
[04:01:23.024 --> 04:01:29.068]  Now if they really wanted to wipe us out quickly, thorium oxide will cause men to go sterile.
[04:01:29.568 --> 04:01:31.129]  But they chose barium oxide.
[04:01:31.129 --> 04:01:31.829]  Let me stop you.
[04:01:31.829 --> 04:01:32.770]  You say they chose.
[04:01:32.770 --> 04:01:35.272]  That's only one program and I've looked at that as well.
[04:01:35.272 --> 04:01:37.893]  There's thousands of different programs going on.
[04:01:37.893 --> 04:01:42.356]  They're spraying a whole bunch of different types of metals and oxides in the atmosphere.
[04:01:42.356 --> 04:01:45.538]  David Icke, the chemtrails, an attempt to poison us?
[04:01:46.300 --> 04:02:04.760]  Well, I was earlier this year in Arizona and I was sitting in a house every morning watching the sky, I think it was coming up from an Arizona airbase, the sky being crisscrossed every day until the blue sky disappeared and it was just
[04:02:06.101 --> 04:02:06.622]  I think so.
[04:02:24.023 --> 04:02:24.623]  It's interesting.
[04:02:24.623 --> 04:02:32.647]  We mentioned earlier in the show, Alex, and I think this is one way that they're putting nanotechnology into the atmosphere.
[04:02:32.647 --> 04:02:40.071]  I feel myself that the chemtrails and the HAARP system is completely connected.
[04:02:40.071 --> 04:02:45.453]  I mean, I think there's multi reasons why the chemtrails are there and there's multi things in them to have multi effects.
[04:02:45.453 --> 04:02:46.714]  But I think what they're trying to do
[04:02:47.625 --> 04:02:52.449]  It's to do with creating a sub-reality in which they can feed in these thought forms and
[04:03:17.548 --> 04:03:26.472]  Uh, messages through the radio waves on the frequency of the human body computer receiver transmission frequencies.
[04:03:26.472 --> 04:03:28.713]  So they're feeding realities into us that way as well.
[04:03:29.926 --> 04:03:40.458]  Well, we know that, I mean, I remember you talking about this over a decade ago, seeing government documents and patents, but I saw the Baltimore Sun like seven years ago saying, oh, DARPA's going to put in U.S.
[04:03:40.458 --> 04:03:47.666]  cities towers with different wavelengths they found to calm people if there's ever an emergency.
[04:03:47.666 --> 04:03:50.148]  I mean, they are admitting they're doing this.
[04:03:50.148 --> 04:03:51.270]  This is not our opinion.
[04:03:51.724 --> 04:04:05.039]  Yeah, and you know in They Live where at the end of the movie they find that there's a transmission from the top of the TV tower which is making it impossible for the public to see the real controllers.
[04:04:05.039 --> 04:04:08.403]  I think that that is also massively based on truth.
[04:04:09.603 --> 04:04:21.849]  Because the body computer has a receiver transmitter frequency, if they can find technology, and of course they have, which can broadcast on that frequency, they're actually feeding information into the human mind.
[04:04:21.849 --> 04:04:23.130]  And of course, what do people think?
[04:04:23.130 --> 04:04:25.191]  They think it's their thoughts.
[04:04:25.191 --> 04:04:35.676]  And also, it can shut the human mind down, so it's not seeing certain frequencies on which certain things are happening, so that they're going on and we can't even see them, just as they live kind of symbolized.
[04:04:36.216 --> 04:04:38.197]  Well, David, I'm going to take a few final calls and let you go.
[04:04:38.197 --> 04:04:41.799]  We've taken enough of your time, but why did you wake up?
[04:04:41.799 --> 04:04:43.600]  Why did I wake up?
[04:04:43.600 --> 04:04:48.083]  Why do some people wake up and other people don't?
[04:04:48.083 --> 04:04:52.305]  Well, I think that it's literally the depth of programming.
[04:04:52.305 --> 04:04:59.989]  You know, if you are surrounded by six foot of concrete, it's much more difficult to perceive what's outside.
[04:04:59.989 --> 04:05:03.611]  You know, if you've got an inch of concrete, then you might hear something.
[04:05:04.231 --> 04:05:13.654]  And what's happening is that people are waking up in accordance to how asleep they were.
[04:05:13.654 --> 04:05:18.895]  And what's happening now is people are waking up who, further back down the line, were very asleep.
[04:05:18.895 --> 04:05:20.916]  And that's very, very encouraging.
[04:05:20.916 --> 04:05:21.916]  What about genetics?
[04:05:21.916 --> 04:05:31.078]  You're always saying that the elites are obsessed with genetics, and we know they are, because they want to focus the genetics for the type of predatory system they're into.
[04:05:31.078 --> 04:05:33.079]  Is it also genetics to be awake to this?
[04:05:33.946 --> 04:05:37.507]  Well, consciousness can overpower the computer.
[04:05:37.507 --> 04:05:39.627]  What will overpower the reality of the computer?
[04:05:39.627 --> 04:05:45.728]  What they're trying to do is put people so powerfully into computer reality through genetic manipulation.
[04:05:45.728 --> 04:05:49.249]  And, of course, genetically modified food is only there for one reason.
[04:05:49.249 --> 04:05:50.909]  It's to genetically modify us.
[04:05:50.909 --> 04:05:52.949]  Oh, they admit it kills the animals they feed it to.
[04:05:52.949 --> 04:06:00.171]  Yeah, so that the body computer becomes a less and less effective receiver-transmitter of higher levels of information.
[04:06:00.171 --> 04:06:02.351]  I don't know how long we've got left, but let me say this.
[04:06:02.711 --> 04:06:08.935]  You've got as much time as you want, but I don't want to keep you past... I just want to say one thing, because you brought up this thing about genetics.
[04:06:08.935 --> 04:06:10.656]  This is what I feel.
[04:06:10.656 --> 04:06:18.381]  You know, I've talked about this reptilian stuff, and people kind of immediately kind of dismiss it, because it's so different to their reality.
[04:06:18.381 --> 04:06:27.527]  You look at some of the things in the Bible, you look at endless accounts in other ancient writings, and you'll see this theme coming up.
[04:06:27.527 --> 04:06:29.669]  For me, I mean, do people think that the
[04:06:31.006 --> 04:06:39.850]  Uh, the snake in the Garden of Eden with Adam and Eve, which was all about genetics and the changing of humanity and all the rest of it, and leaving the paradise.
[04:06:39.850 --> 04:06:42.672]  Do they think it was literally a snake?
[04:06:42.672 --> 04:06:47.394]  And that story can be found in the same basic form all over the world.
[04:06:47.394 --> 04:06:47.774]  Well, it wasn't.
[04:06:47.774 --> 04:06:48.955]  He had legs.
[04:06:48.955 --> 04:06:49.415]  It says...
[04:06:50.075 --> 04:06:50.855]  Exactly!
[04:06:50.855 --> 04:06:57.858]  The Jewish name for that snake actually refers to a humanoid being.
[04:06:57.858 --> 04:07:19.206]  Now for me, that whole Adam and Eve kind of symbolism which you find around the world where it talks about these reptilian gods manipulating human genetics, for me what they've done, and there's increasing hard genetic evidence for this, is they've spliced the genes around, or the DNA around, so that we stopped perceiving
[04:07:19.206 --> 04:07:20.187]  We're good to go.
[04:07:48.321 --> 04:07:49.161]  We're good to go.
[04:08:06.249 --> 04:08:09.331]  By the way, David, this is not just your opinion.
[04:08:09.331 --> 04:08:11.192]  As you know, major scientific institutions, governments,
[04:08:23.980 --> 04:08:48.422]  Had always said it was junk DNA, but now they're noticing that, even if you believe in evolution, on a different evolutionary curve, humans have in their DNA copies of all these other life forms that aren't in our supposed evolutionary development with the way that, you know, they've put out evolution and all the disinformation packaged on that, and top scientists who were atheists
[04:08:49.042 --> 04:08:54.866]  Are now saying, I don't know what made it, but this stuff is engineered.
[04:08:54.866 --> 04:08:56.286]  Yeah, well, exactly.
[04:08:56.286 --> 04:09:03.591]  And you know, the human condition can be brilliantly symbolized by what's happening in China.
[04:09:04.441 --> 04:09:14.951]  We have a collective reality called the Internet, which is very, very, in a much lesser way, of course, very symbolic of the reality we're actually experiencing, the Matrix.
[04:09:14.951 --> 04:09:30.265]  What they do in China, the authorities, because they don't want the people to have access to information that could wake them up and get them to see the situation, is they're firewalling off computers, of course, so that people in China can only access a much smaller part of the Internet than the rest of the population.
[04:09:30.425 --> 04:09:31.646]  But that didn't work!
[04:09:31.646 --> 04:09:37.391]  Hold on, that didn't work, so now they're going to by law make all new computers have a self-regulator built into it.
[04:09:37.391 --> 04:09:42.815]  That's the drugs, that's the chemicals, that's the programming in the computer itself, not just the network.
[04:09:42.815 --> 04:09:55.066]  Yeah, and what initially happened, I would suggest, is that those body computers were programmed to not receive and therefore decode and experience
[04:09:55.866 --> 04:09:56.426]  I think so.
[04:10:11.313 --> 04:10:12.134]  Uh, why?
[04:10:12.134 --> 04:10:17.499]  Because it's been, uh, the body computer has been made to only access that frequency.
[04:10:17.499 --> 04:10:30.252]  Um, and, uh, that's what's happened, and, um, that's why we can't see the gods now that operate just outside of visible light, as, as the ancient accounts talked about in the, in, uh, eons ago.
[04:10:31.357 --> 04:10:31.797]  Amazing.
[04:10:31.797 --> 04:10:32.998]  We promised to go to a few of these calls.
[04:10:32.998 --> 04:10:34.619]  We're going to end the show in just a few minutes here.
[04:10:34.619 --> 04:10:37.320]  Quickly, I've just got a new list here.
[04:10:37.320 --> 04:10:39.021]  Let's talk to Leo.
[04:10:39.021 --> 04:10:40.362]  Leo, you're on the air with David Icker.
[04:10:40.362 --> 04:10:41.682]  Go ahead.
[04:10:41.682 --> 04:10:43.723]  Hi, this is Leo from Rock Tourist.
[04:10:43.723 --> 04:10:44.904]  Okay, let's not screw around.
[04:10:44.904 --> 04:10:46.765]  Go ahead and ask your question to David Icker.
[04:10:46.765 --> 04:10:48.026]  I'm going to move on.
[04:10:48.026 --> 04:10:49.026]  Okay.
[04:10:49.026 --> 04:10:56.470]  I think we should start letting everybody know about Hitler's browsers being done in on the
[04:10:57.245 --> 04:11:02.549]  Night of the Long Knives, because that's how we get the police to understand that they're disposable.
[04:11:02.549 --> 04:11:10.774]  And as far as calling people sheeple, it's an insult to sheep, because sheep are way too smart to watch television.
[04:11:10.774 --> 04:11:15.037]  And we should call them asleeple, because they're sleepwalking through life.
[04:11:15.037 --> 04:11:15.838]  I hear you, Leo.
[04:11:15.838 --> 04:11:17.379]  I appreciate your call.
[04:11:17.379 --> 04:11:18.620]  Yes, the elites.
[04:11:18.620 --> 04:11:22.843]  Why do elites always terminate the group that helped them bring in the tyranny?
[04:11:24.281 --> 04:11:26.323]  Because they don't want them either.
[04:11:26.323 --> 04:11:29.125]  I mean, you know, this is the thing about elites.
[04:11:29.125 --> 04:11:42.195]  They are as contemptuous, in fact even more so, of those that blindly help them bring in their tyrannies as they are the general population that they tyrannize.
[04:11:42.195 --> 04:11:43.636]  They've got total contempt.
[04:11:43.636 --> 04:11:49.421]  You see, these guys see humans in terms of the way so many humans see cattle.
[04:11:49.421 --> 04:11:52.163]  And, you know, they use the cattle
[04:11:53.015 --> 04:11:53.255]  I think
[04:12:07.813 --> 04:12:12.794]  Folks, do you respect a cow more or a sheep or do you respect a grizzly bear or a wolf?
[04:12:12.794 --> 04:12:16.575]  Do you respect a killer whale more than you respect a jellyfish?
[04:12:16.575 --> 04:12:21.096]  You see, the elite respect people that fight them and resist them and know what they are.
[04:12:21.096 --> 04:12:24.137]  They think of... and I've had, you know, globalists tell me that.
[04:12:24.137 --> 04:12:24.997]  A few final calls.
[04:12:24.997 --> 04:12:26.837]  Gotta let David go in here just a minute.
[04:12:26.837 --> 04:12:29.258]  This is just amazing information.
[04:12:29.258 --> 04:12:32.959]  Let's talk to, up next, Robert in Kentucky.
[04:12:32.959 --> 04:12:33.559]  You're on the air.
[04:12:33.559 --> 04:12:33.919]  Go ahead.
[04:12:35.019 --> 04:12:36.221]  Oh, great.
[04:12:36.221 --> 04:12:38.543]  Alex, David, I'm a big fan of both of yours.
[04:12:38.543 --> 04:12:40.485]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[04:12:40.485 --> 04:12:46.932]  I just wanted to know, David, from your perspective, I'm glad you brought up the reptilian.
[04:12:46.932 --> 04:12:47.913]  Last week, the U.S.
[04:12:47.913 --> 04:12:52.698]  military cut off all information on incoming foreign bodies.
[04:12:53.018 --> 04:12:55.842]  Yes, that was in the Associated Press and NASA.
[04:12:55.842 --> 04:12:59.426]  All meteor storms, you know, they have them every year.
[04:12:59.426 --> 04:13:06.314]  Everything's classified coming into the atmosphere now and all the rocks that come into the planet that they put on the news.
[04:13:06.314 --> 04:13:08.477]  Now national security, David.
[04:13:08.477 --> 04:13:09.518]  I know you saw that.
[04:13:09.518 --> 04:13:10.960]  What are you... Sorry, caller.
[04:13:10.960 --> 04:13:11.200]  Go ahead.
[04:13:12.851 --> 04:13:21.675]  Do you think that, what is your perspective on that playing into the return of the Anunnaki, the gods?
[04:13:21.675 --> 04:13:23.596]  Like I said, I'll take the answer on that.
[04:13:32.452 --> 04:13:48.158]  We are not the only life species in this universe, but you know, people see visible light as the universe, and like I say, the universe is visible light plus all the dark matter, which is the vast majority of this universe,
[04:13:50.599 --> 04:14:00.161]  We cannot decode and it's very badly named dark matter or dark energy because it gives the perception of being like somewhere with a light off.
[04:14:00.161 --> 04:14:01.302]  It's not like that.
[04:14:01.302 --> 04:14:11.324]  They call it dark because they can't see it and they can't see it because they're in bodies that can't decode it and a lot of these so-called aliens or extraterrestrial forms
[04:14:11.744 --> 04:14:22.815]  They actually come into visible light from the dark energy areas of the universe because they can move frequencies and so they can appear and disappear.
[04:14:22.815 --> 04:14:26.819]  This is when people see a UFO or some entity appear and disappear.
[04:14:26.819 --> 04:14:29.702]  It's left the frequency of visible light so they can't decode it.
[04:14:29.702 --> 04:14:32.525]  So to their perception it appears and disappears.
[04:14:32.525 --> 04:14:32.945]  It doesn't.
[04:14:35.094 --> 04:14:40.859]  Well, now that we've gotten off in this realm, we are on a planet in the middle of the universe with billions of galaxies around us.
[04:14:40.859 --> 04:14:42.441]  And Collar, I appreciate your call.
[04:14:42.441 --> 04:14:46.945]  In closing, David, is there anybody going to come help us from the evil Reptoid rulers?
[04:14:46.945 --> 04:14:48.046]  I mean, anybody going to save us?
[04:14:48.046 --> 04:14:50.008]  I guess that's up to us to do.
[04:14:50.008 --> 04:14:52.550]  I don't think we need saving.
[04:14:52.550 --> 04:14:54.632]  I think the means is already there.
[04:14:54.632 --> 04:14:56.454]  It's called becoming conscious.
[04:14:56.454 --> 04:15:00.878]  And you see, there's a reason why these guys are terrified of us becoming conscious, and they work
[04:15:01.478 --> 04:15:07.923]  So desperately hard, more so than ever before, because they have to, to keep us asleep.
[04:15:07.923 --> 04:15:10.705]  Because when we wake up, it's over for them.
[04:15:10.705 --> 04:15:11.606]  They know that.
[04:15:11.606 --> 04:15:15.368]  I don't fully know the reason, but there's a reason they're terrified of us.
[04:15:15.368 --> 04:15:19.151]  Because of powers that humans have that they do not have.
[04:15:19.151 --> 04:15:22.674]  And certainly when you are in the depths
[04:15:25.358 --> 04:15:34.702]  I don't like using the word evil, but the depth of imbalance that they're in and sickness, they cannot even begin to access consciousness.
[04:15:34.702 --> 04:15:41.084]  They're so far away from it vibrationally because of the density their state of mind puts them in.
[04:15:41.084 --> 04:15:44.726]  Well, David, since you brought up the Garden of Eden and
[04:15:46.618 --> 04:15:51.203]  You know, the issue here is we're made in the image of God.
[04:15:51.203 --> 04:16:00.192]  I mean, if you really interpret the Bible that way, are we a copy or some manifestation of something else that's on other planets?
[04:16:01.001 --> 04:16:17.771]  Well, you see, I think this whole universe, this whole reality, this whole infinite awareness is just so extraordinary compared with what we've been led to believe through our lives.
[04:16:17.771 --> 04:16:27.877]  You see, even religions and all these different ways of seeing God and life, we've got to remember that these have all developed
[04:16:28.337 --> 04:16:28.637]  We're good.
[04:16:43.647 --> 04:16:52.733]  Then, and you've hinted at it a few times, the things you've said in the show, you start to see the full, incredible magnitude of what we're part of.
[04:16:52.733 --> 04:16:56.136]  Not just what we're part of, but what we are.
[04:16:56.136 --> 04:17:05.822]  And it's preventing us from that realization, that self-realization that we are infinite consciousness, that they work so hard to do.
[04:17:05.822 --> 04:17:10.145]  Because if they didn't, and they weren't successful at doing it, then what they do would be impossible.
[04:17:10.629 --> 04:17:15.798]  Well, it's like Bill Hicks said, then you figure out that it's just a ride, and people are like, shut up, kill him, shut him up.
[04:17:15.798 --> 04:17:16.499]  Yeah, exactly.
[04:17:16.499 --> 04:17:18.323]  I got a lot invested in this ride.
[04:17:18.323 --> 04:17:18.843]  Exactly.
[04:17:18.843 --> 04:17:22.850]  You know, I mean, how many Christians would kill Jesus if he came back, you know?
[04:17:22.850 --> 04:17:23.432]  I mean, please.
[04:17:24.332 --> 04:17:26.193]  Well, David Icke, I'm not going to go any more calls.
[04:17:26.193 --> 04:17:28.174]  I apologize to Bridget, Maria, and Ryan and Tim.
[04:17:28.174 --> 04:17:29.755]  We've kept David too long.
[04:17:29.755 --> 04:17:36.718]  And just always an amazing having you on, coming to the United States in October at TalesAtDavidIcke.com.
[04:17:36.718 --> 04:17:41.640]  God bless you, David, and we appreciate your time coming on with us.
[04:17:41.640 --> 04:17:43.781]  Do we know the name of the new book coming out?
[04:17:43.781 --> 04:17:47.183]  I've got a working title, but I might change it, so I'll keep it to myself.
[04:17:47.183 --> 04:17:50.084]  But I'll be finished by September for sure.
[04:17:50.982 --> 04:17:56.106]  Okay, well we look forward to having you back on in the next few months as soon as it's done.
[04:17:56.106 --> 04:17:58.668]  And be careful, my friend.
[04:17:58.668 --> 04:17:59.168]  Okay, mate.
[04:17:59.168 --> 04:17:59.729]  Cheers, Alex.
[04:17:59.729 --> 04:18:00.229]  Bye.
[04:18:00.229 --> 04:18:00.610]  Take care.
[04:18:00.610 --> 04:18:02.611]  There he goes.
[04:18:02.611 --> 04:18:11.778]  Ladies and gentlemen, going where this show has not gone before, but I think it's important for people to just expand their paradigms, question everything.
[04:18:11.778 --> 04:18:15.061]  That's what we've done with David Icke today.
[04:18:15.061 --> 04:18:16.442]  Jason Bermas back to 9-9 at midnight.
[04:18:16.442 --> 04:18:17.883]  I'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m.
