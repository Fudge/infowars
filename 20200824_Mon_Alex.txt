[00:00.000 --> 00:09.040]  Red Alert, Red Alert, Red Alert, 70 days out from the election to overshadow the Republican
[00:09.040 --> 00:12.560]  National Convention that Trump is going to speak every night at.
[00:12.560 --> 00:17.120]  The deep state has launched even more intense riots, police being shot at, knocked to the
[00:17.120 --> 00:22.120]  head with bricks, car dealerships being burned down, businesses that have Black Lives Matter
[00:22.120 --> 00:25.040]  signs being torched.
[00:25.040 --> 00:29.800]  This is the globalist program of total destruction that the people are waking up and the truth
[00:29.800 --> 00:31.640]  is getting out.
[00:31.640 --> 00:36.800]  The defund the police movement is already showing signs of being an exercise in sheer
[00:36.800 --> 00:37.800]  futility.
[00:37.800 --> 00:42.160]  Over the weekend, these supposed protesters in Portland, Oregon, who are well on their
[00:42.160 --> 00:48.280]  way to 100 days of rioting, were met with a contingent of patriots supporting blue lives.
[00:48.280 --> 00:54.120]  These patriots tend to be older, larger and adept at throwing a haymaker.
[00:54.120 --> 00:58.160]  I've been in combat and I never wanted to go back again, but I'm telling you what, I
[00:58.160 --> 00:59.160]  will to save this country.
[00:59.160 --> 01:03.800]  If it has to be against our own citizens, it will happen and there's a million people
[01:03.800 --> 01:05.520]  like me and you won't stop us.
[01:05.520 --> 01:11.040]  And when I come to have a one-on-one conversation with someone who has a blue life matter flag
[01:11.040 --> 01:16.160]  on, they say it's just my opinion, I don't need anyone to terrorize.
[01:16.160 --> 01:23.760]  I am terrorized for living, I am terrorized for breathing, for being educated and when
[01:23.760 --> 01:28.600]  I am educated, there's an issue, what's that as well?
[01:28.600 --> 01:33.680]  Also over the weekend, Denver, Colorado police stood their ground protecting the Denver Police
[01:33.680 --> 01:34.680]  Department.
[01:34.680 --> 01:40.320]  But all across the rest of downtown Denver, local reporters described ugly scenes of arson
[01:40.320 --> 01:41.320]  and vandalism.
[01:41.320 --> 01:46.000]  They threw fireworks at police standing in riot gear outside the building and copter
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.240]  four caught some protesters starting fires and smashing a store window right across
[01:51.240 --> 01:53.720]  the street from where police were watching.
[01:53.720 --> 01:58.480]  Police deployed chemical agents to break up that crowd and earlier in the evening we
[01:58.480 --> 02:01.080]  saw officers arresting protesters.
[02:01.080 --> 02:04.360]  Police tell us so far they've arrested eight people.
[02:04.360 --> 02:07.440]  No word on what charges those people will be facing.
[02:07.440 --> 02:13.440]  Antifa and BLM crybabies taking the rage out on the liberal stronghold of Denver and Colorado
[02:13.440 --> 02:16.840]  after being thrown out of other areas of Colorado.
[02:16.840 --> 02:22.000]  When the police have been defunded and they either stand down or aren't even responding,
[02:22.000 --> 02:29.000]  but then Antifa and BLM as business owners, veterans of true warfare and angry Americans
[02:29.000 --> 02:32.240]  start replacing those sworn to protect you.
[02:32.240 --> 02:36.640]  Who are you going to complain to when the violence you're dishing out is responded with
[02:36.640 --> 02:51.480]  a tsunami of hell on earth?
[02:51.480 --> 02:56.280]  In Austin, Texas, Mayor Adler had his lunch handed to him after defunding the police to
[02:56.280 --> 03:01.600]  the tune of $150 million and then announcing the liberal city council would then raise
[03:01.600 --> 03:05.040]  the property taxes by 26%.
[03:05.040 --> 03:11.480]  Many say you most definitely cut $150 million from the Austin Police Department.
[03:11.480 --> 03:17.400]  Council members Greg Cassar, Natasha Harper Madison did not take issue with the $150 million
[03:17.400 --> 03:18.400]  number.
[03:18.400 --> 03:20.600]  However, you disagree now with that number.
[03:20.600 --> 03:21.600]  Can you explain why?
[03:21.600 --> 03:22.600]  Sure.
[03:22.600 --> 03:28.560]  We didn't cut $150 million out of the police budget, but we did do real transformative
[03:28.560 --> 03:29.560]  change.
[03:29.560 --> 03:35.920]  In response, the governor froze property taxes indefinitely, putting an end to Mayor Adler's
[03:35.920 --> 03:38.160]  earmarked plans.
[03:38.160 --> 03:46.160]  When crime is on the rise, the last thing that we should do is to defund law enforcement.
[03:46.160 --> 03:51.200]  And yet that is exactly what the city of Austin did.
[03:51.200 --> 04:00.320]  Any city that defunds police departments will have its property tax revenue frozen at the
[04:00.320 --> 04:01.880]  current level.
[04:01.880 --> 04:11.560]  They will never be able to increase property tax revenue again if they defund police.
[04:11.560 --> 04:17.240]  Things that endanger residents by reducing law enforcement should not then be able to
[04:17.240 --> 04:25.440]  turn around and go back and get more property tax dollars from those same residents whose
[04:25.440 --> 04:29.040]  lives the city just endangered.
[04:29.040 --> 04:31.400]  Careful what you ask for, Marxist.
[04:31.400 --> 04:37.080]  The only thing between you and millions of outraged Americans is the very thing you want
[04:37.080 --> 04:38.080]  abolished.
[04:38.080 --> 04:39.520]  John Baum reporting.
[04:39.520 --> 04:46.520]  Now, we've got the incredible breakdown happening in Wisconsin and in Portland, the latest developments
[04:46.520 --> 04:51.760]  as the Democrats try to destabilize the country and overshadow the RNC when we come back.
[04:51.760 --> 04:59.880]  It is incredible footage, stay with us.
[04:59.880 --> 05:03.720]  Constantly, whether it's the New York Times, the Washington Post, or Howard Stern of a
[05:03.720 --> 05:07.600]  group, you name it, they come out and they attack you in full war saying, Jones claims
[05:07.600 --> 05:13.560]  civil war is coming and financial collapse and planetary lockdowns using viruses and
[05:13.560 --> 05:17.960]  he tells people they should get off the grid and get prepared and have storable food if
[05:17.960 --> 05:18.960]  they can.
[05:18.960 --> 05:23.760]  And now everything I've warned people about is coming true because it was all in the Rockefeller
[05:23.760 --> 05:26.440]  Foundation documents like lockstep.
[05:26.440 --> 05:29.480]  This is the corporate planetary takeover.
[05:29.480 --> 05:34.400]  So yes, I stand by what I said 10 years ago, what I said a year ago, and what I said last
[05:34.400 --> 05:38.480]  week, more than ever, get your high quality storeable foods at infowarstore.com.
[05:38.480 --> 05:41.320]  That's one of the key check marks of the check boxes.

[05:47.520 --> 05:50.160]  Get it before the next big rush comes.

[05:55.200 --> 06:22.920]  supports the info war Monday, August 24th, the year is 2020 70 days out from the election.
[06:22.920 --> 06:28.800]  The obvious attempt by multinational corporations allied with the communist Chinese, Hollywood
[06:28.800 --> 06:34.680]  and America haters to break this country, kill the dollar and plunge us into a world
[06:34.680 --> 06:38.840]  warrior like nightmare has never been more clear.
[06:38.840 --> 06:41.080]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[06:41.080 --> 06:45.000]  I intend to open the phones up at the bottom of the hour.
[06:45.000 --> 06:53.320]  We have Savannah Hernandez and Gregory's that were just in Portland for the incredible
[06:53.320 --> 06:55.440]  street battles and rioting that went on.
[06:55.440 --> 06:59.320]  They're going to be in studio in the third hour and another reporter who was just on
[06:59.320 --> 07:08.120]  Tucker Carlson and has been shooting incredible footage is going to be joining us from Wisconsin
[07:08.120 --> 07:17.200]  where it looks like again seems out of a third world collapse or civil war.
[07:17.200 --> 07:23.520]  Road warrior isn't even strong enough to describe it police getting shot at police being stopped
[07:23.520 --> 07:28.920]  by black lives matter communist checkpoints warehouses being burned down car dealerships
[07:28.920 --> 07:34.640]  burned down churches burned down street battles everywhere people running up hitting police
[07:34.640 --> 07:42.520]  in the back of the head with bricks total loss of control.
[07:42.520 --> 07:49.040]  American flags being guillotined they're now rolling guillotines out this is all Jacob
[07:49.040 --> 07:57.760]  and French Revolution 2.0 as we told you and them attacking the police armored vehicles
[07:57.760 --> 08:01.360]  people say why do we have an armored vehicle and we bought it last year knowing all this
[08:01.360 --> 08:02.360]  was coming.
[08:02.360 --> 08:08.080]  This is a black lives matter long-haired hippie running up with his assault rifle menacing
[08:08.080 --> 08:13.800]  and ordering the police around and the police are so paralyzed that if they do anything that
[08:13.800 --> 08:19.240]  they'll all be given you know the death penalty that they're just letting them do it.
[08:19.240 --> 08:23.600]  So it's all completely out of control and the police will be assisting somebody they
[08:23.600 --> 08:30.840]  get hit in the back of the head with that rock a brick or a hammer.
[08:30.840 --> 08:38.720]  This is how communists overthrow your country in fact I was going to play the clip from
[08:38.720 --> 08:41.880]  Big Mike from last week we're going to hit that in a minute but also pull up the new
[08:41.880 --> 08:50.040]  call of duty two minute ad that actually has a real former KGB officer who came over here
[08:50.040 --> 08:55.000]  and explain what the plan was but again it's not a Russian plan the left in America went
[08:55.000 --> 09:01.160]  over to Russia and took it over that's on record in 1917 and then exploited Russia to
[09:01.160 --> 09:08.760]  take over much of the planet and so when you see the same thing playing out here understand
[09:08.760 --> 09:12.520]  it's not the Russians running it's the left that wants to get rid of America it's the
[09:12.520 --> 09:17.360]  left ally of the communist China so we're going to get to that in a moment as well but here's
[09:17.360 --> 09:22.240]  Big Mike last week threatening you that things are going to get a lot worse if you reelect
[09:22.240 --> 09:26.360]  Trump in Atlantic Monthly in the New York Times the Washington Post and CNN and they
[09:26.360 --> 09:32.480]  must have been seen you've seen them all we've played the clips have said rioting is good
[09:32.480 --> 09:38.920]  violence is good protesting is supposed to be violent it's supposed to target white people
[09:38.920 --> 09:45.720]  in race war and they're just conditioning you to accept that their communist overthrow
[09:45.720 --> 09:50.720]  of the country at the behest of the multinational corporations that just want to divide the nation
[09:50.720 --> 09:55.520]  up like they did communist China because the same globalists that took over Russia they
[09:55.520 --> 10:00.960]  took over China in 1949 put Mao in that's been declassified it's the globalists that
[10:00.960 --> 10:08.240]  have already done this in Russia and China and now they're trying to finish the job here
[10:08.240 --> 10:12.760]  remember what the Democrats said on all those hidden Veritas videos a year ago six months
[10:12.760 --> 10:17.520]  ago that the media poo pooed we're going to burn the cities ahead of the election we're
[10:17.520 --> 10:22.720]  going to burn the cities after the election if Trump wins so they're trying to hold us
[10:22.720 --> 10:29.360]  hostage now hoping with the mask and the lockdowns and the rioting and the burning and the pay
[10:29.360 --> 10:37.120]  checks being canceled and with record home foreclosures that you're going to blame Trump
[10:37.120 --> 10:41.240]  and think that America did this when this was Americans trying to get back control of
[10:41.240 --> 10:45.320]  their country to the multinational corporations with the chai comms with the globalist with
[10:45.320 --> 10:49.920]  Hollywood with the blue states with the blue cities all worked in unison to have the fake
[10:49.920 --> 10:57.440]  lockdown the exaggerated covid hoax when it kills less the flu and all of this to shut
[10:57.440 --> 11:09.280]  us down under the oldest form of war siege blockade starving us out locking us down
[11:09.280 --> 11:17.280]  home arrest and you see what's happening in Spain and France and in Australia and New
[11:17.280 --> 11:25.520]  Zealand now women particularly beaten savagely by police with batons for not wearing their
[11:25.520 --> 11:33.040]  mask oh but meanwhile Muslims are literally burning down Paris but women in a parking
[11:33.040 --> 11:40.760]  garage are beaten with a baton and French police stormed a sports bar in full riot
[11:40.760 --> 11:46.040]  year we're gonna play that footage coming up and beat people over they had with batons
[11:46.040 --> 11:55.200]  who were not even resisting to punish them for going to a bar to watch a soccer game
[11:55.200 --> 12:03.600]  while all over Paris the Muslims burned apartment blocks cars killed people because the police
[12:03.600 --> 12:10.320]  are there to keep the milk cows the French original French in line submitting this is
[12:10.320 --> 12:16.680]  all an exercise in power info wars dot com Spain woman beaten by police for not properly
[12:16.680 --> 12:23.920]  wearing face masks not properly it's not over your nose boom boom boom baton and the cops
[12:23.920 --> 12:34.200]  wearing a night stocking a pantyhose over the head that's the new thing this is all
[12:34.200 --> 12:38.080]  about the government being masked so don't worry once the left gives control like Spain
[12:38.080 --> 12:43.200]  or France or Australia they're gonna beat you senseless they're gonna walk up and hit
[12:43.200 --> 12:50.760]  women right and they have a batons I love how the woman but defiantly doesn't do it
[12:50.760 --> 12:54.640]  they're attacking the other women and now they're kicking two-year-old babies off planes
[12:54.640 --> 13:01.440]  I won't wear the mask it's all the cult trying to make you submit all of it together unified
[13:01.440 --> 13:07.320]  it's their plan they admitted ish and everyone you see wearing the mask and submitting everyone
[13:07.320 --> 13:11.560]  you see bowing down the black lives matter in George Soros it has nothing to do with
[13:11.560 --> 13:18.160]  black people or a virus or any of it it's about power and it's about control and Obama
[13:18.160 --> 13:23.960]  has come out we've got the video I want to talk as plainly as I can about the stakes
[13:23.960 --> 13:27.560]  in this election Obama said Wednesday during the Democrat National Convention because what
[13:27.560 --> 13:33.160]  we do these next 76 days will echo through generations to come what's the state right
[13:33.160 --> 13:39.200]  now our democracy our future he says basically an apocalypse yeah their globalist apocalypse
[13:39.200 --> 13:43.960]  the breaking of the American people they want starvation they want COVID to be the cover
[13:43.960 --> 13:50.080]  to make you turn your guns into get food two three years from now during the lockdown it
[13:50.080 --> 13:58.320]  never is going to end and I told you that in February I said it's a planetary takeover
[13:58.320 --> 14:01.480]  by the UN they're already in control of the internet they're in control of what you can
[14:01.480 --> 14:05.400]  say they admit it's a shut down carbon to break down the third world to break down the
[14:05.400 --> 14:09.200]  first world then they're going to flood us with the third world who's starving to death
[14:09.200 --> 14:16.640]  while we're going bankrupt this is how communists get control of society they did Venezuela
[14:16.640 --> 14:23.520]  on purpose they did Russia on purpose the commies would scientists could put satellites
[14:23.520 --> 14:28.080]  in space but they made sure you didn't get food because they don't want you to when they
[14:28.080 --> 14:32.840]  get full control like China then they turn the economy on but only to exploit and take
[14:32.840 --> 14:39.200]  over other countries with economic warfare so here's big Mike with her hundreds of millions
[14:39.200 --> 14:46.120]  of dollars pushing civil war telling you America sucks well she works for the most powerful
[14:46.120 --> 14:49.240]  people on earth telling you it's going to get a lot worse if you don't do what she says
[14:49.240 --> 14:57.360]  here it is tonight it is this if you think things cannot possibly get worse trust me
[14:57.360 --> 15:04.680]  they can and they will if we don't make a change in this election if we have any hope
[15:04.680 --> 15:11.280]  of ending this chaos we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it yeah
[15:11.280 --> 15:16.320]  your lives do depend on it wow because these criminals have censored everything they've
[15:16.320 --> 15:21.720]  attacked everything no borders no wall no USA at all they have shipped in the fentanyl
[15:21.720 --> 15:27.800]  that's killed millions of 1.4 million died just last year of TB that the Democrats helped
[15:27.800 --> 15:33.320]  ship in and blocked people stopping these criminals know their cornered so now they're
[15:33.320 --> 15:37.000]  going to throw everything they've got and so they need a cover for George Soros and
[15:37.000 --> 15:41.640]  their globalist communist overthrow so they use black people as the cover but you go out
[15:41.640 --> 15:46.440]  to almost all these events it's 80% white ladies and gentlemen little low level Bernie
[15:46.440 --> 15:50.520]  Sanders type supporters that are the foot soldiers that promised to launch these violent
[15:50.520 --> 15:57.200]  attacks we'll cover how we can stop them on the other side stay with us when the corrupt
[15:57.200 --> 16:03.000]  establishment began pushing Joe Biden two years ago they knew he had serious cognitive
[16:03.000 --> 16:08.360]  problems he has always been an empty suit that does what he's told by the globalist
[16:08.360 --> 16:13.000]  and their allied crime syndicates Kamala Harris is even worse and does whatever she's
[16:13.000 --> 16:19.320]  told she's bought and paid for by Silicon Valley the chai comms and others so she has
[16:19.320 --> 16:25.720]  been chosen because she's part African and now anyone that criticizes her will be called
[16:25.720 --> 16:32.840]  a racist and evil and she is now above reproach ladies and gentlemen we must expose this monster
[16:32.840 --> 16:37.880]  for who she is we must expose the fact that she wanted minimum sentences for black people
[16:37.880 --> 16:44.080]  three times longer than white people that the woman is a monster Kamala Harris will end
[16:44.080 --> 16:50.000]  up being our president if they're able to steal the election and she is a 110 percent

[17:28.560 --> 17:32.920]  with cowards they won't even stand up against it and do anything even though our president

[24:30.360 --> 24:35.040]  they're looking for a manhunt or something I'm gonna comply and I believe it's lawful
[24:35.040 --> 24:39.440]  but if I pull up to a pack of thugs at a checkpoint pointing guns at me and telling me to pull

[26:32.680 --> 26:36.200]  seen it on CNN they won't show it happen and now they're in front of the armored vehicle
[26:36.200 --> 26:41.040]  trying to stop it they're trying to go to a riot scene with burning buildings and burning

[30:00.080 --> 30:14.000]  the left
[30:15.680 --> 30:20.000]  wants power and wants control they're not liberal they're the left-hand path they come out of the
[30:20.000 --> 30:26.640]  french revolution founded by adam visopoli and limonati they are satanist this is in mainline
[30:26.640 --> 30:34.160]  history books why did i tell you anti-foot over a decade ago was jacobin was french revolution
[30:35.040 --> 30:41.520]  because that's who soros is that's who vi lennon was that's who joseph stalin was
[30:43.440 --> 30:47.680]  they're evil and they stand for total enslavement
[30:47.680 --> 30:56.080]  and total empowerment to tear the human psyche and the family to pieces
[30:58.320 --> 31:03.120]  we heard a report yesterday that was incredibly powerful it's only two and a half minutes long
[31:03.120 --> 31:07.280]  that i'm going to play at the start of the next segment that goes to the bottom of the
[31:07.280 --> 31:10.480]  rabbit hole and who these people are but i'm going to go to your calls as i said right now
[31:11.440 --> 31:14.720]  that when i start the next hour i'm going to spend some time on the incredible COVID-19
[31:14.720 --> 31:20.080]  developments and all the fake news that the hospitals are all full the ventilators have
[31:20.080 --> 31:26.080]  all run out fetishizing ventilators hoping dumb doctors kill people with them which is an auto
[31:26.080 --> 31:34.000]  immune virus it causes an autoimmune effect you take aerosolized steroids or you take zinc i mean
[31:34.880 --> 31:40.160]  it's easy to beat so they don't want you to know that so we've got all that news
[31:40.160 --> 31:44.880]  we've got the media saying trump isn't going to step down he loses that's the next big push
[31:44.880 --> 31:49.600]  wash and post what if trump loses but insist he won because the democrats are going to announce
[31:49.600 --> 31:54.720]  they won even though they're about to lose they know in all the real polls so we're 70 days out
[31:54.720 --> 32:00.400]  from this what do we do about it how do we warn people well facebook youtube google all of them
[32:00.400 --> 32:04.800]  come out and said we're not going to allow trump to contest the election they've said democrats
[32:04.800 --> 32:12.880]  they've said democrats are allowed to which is announced on friday but if trump challenges it
[32:12.880 --> 32:16.720]  or anybody else there's a kill switch on his supporters meaning you're going to be blocked
[32:16.720 --> 32:20.880]  well you got to hit the streets you got to call talk radio you got to go to public events that's
[32:20.880 --> 32:25.600]  another reason they did the whole covid lockdown was how we took over the last election with bill
[32:25.600 --> 32:29.680]  clinton was a rapist the rest of it that scared them so much they don't want a campaign in public
[32:29.680 --> 32:35.360]  with no crowds coming out to help biden this helps them project their false reality because
[32:35.360 --> 32:40.320]  you're locked down your house you know barton springs i used to go years ago swim laps there
[32:40.320 --> 32:46.240]  a couple times a week they closed that's big giant public spring fed pool so this weekend we went
[32:46.240 --> 32:50.240]  down there and i didn't tell folks to do it it wasn't my idea they spontaneously started
[32:50.240 --> 32:54.160]  climbing over the fence so i joined them and get the main pool area but the spillway spills over
[32:54.160 --> 32:58.880]  and then goes into the colorado river so we swam right there it was just as good i thought you
[32:58.880 --> 33:06.480]  know they tell us don't swim in the colorado river even though if you swim close to the dams
[33:06.480 --> 33:13.120]  and stay back a few hundred yards the currents only about a mile an hour so i said you know what
[33:13.120 --> 33:18.880]  they say don't swim in the colorado i went down there at seven a.m got my mask and snorkel swim
[33:18.880 --> 33:24.160]  a juicy mile i think tomorrow i might swim two miles it felt good i was it was tired the first
[33:24.160 --> 33:29.120]  half mile was really tiring then i turned around felt so good going back like a horse back to the
[33:29.120 --> 33:36.560]  barn so uh they say it blow up the police department get rid of government for the people but only
[33:36.560 --> 33:42.400]  have it for the communist well that it's it's time to stop following their edicts when when outlaws
[33:42.400 --> 33:47.680]  take over the government patriots become the outlaws when when when tyrants of the government
[33:47.680 --> 33:54.960]  we are the outlaws because their law is tyranny and following their law is satanic all right so
[33:54.960 --> 33:59.600]  i'm gonna go to your phone calls right now but these are just epic times and the whole let us
[33:59.600 --> 34:04.480]  build up the university's being anti free speech zones that was just the beginning they're now like
[34:04.480 --> 34:11.840]  metastasizing cancers firing out all their tentacles let's talk to micah new orleans active
[34:11.840 --> 34:18.080]  military on covid-19 vaccines that democrats say will be mandatory they're coming with an untested
[34:18.080 --> 34:22.320]  dangerous vaccine they admit to force you to do something well that's the same thing is coming
[34:22.320 --> 34:29.280]  to your house to shoot you in my view what's your take on it mic my take is that we better get very
[34:29.280 --> 34:35.840]  very very very involved in knowing our rights and knowing our constitutions and even knowing
[34:37.120 --> 34:41.280]  some constitutions from abroad that have gotten some things right but what i want to talk about
[34:41.280 --> 34:44.880]  as far as vaccines with you alex and thank you for everything you do that i wish i was with you
[34:44.880 --> 34:52.800]  guys yesterday uh at the at the lake but um the nuremberg code of 1947 after the nuremberg trials
[34:53.440 --> 35:01.120]  it it put a cap on anyone that wanted to do anything hashtag experimental on people and
[35:01.120 --> 35:06.080]  the code basically said that you have you have to have consent and it cannot anything that you're
[35:06.080 --> 35:09.920]  going to experiment on people they have to consent to it number one it cannot be mandated that they
[35:09.920 --> 35:14.960]  do it which the angel of death dr. joseph mingley he didn't care if you didn't want to do it or not
[35:14.960 --> 35:20.320]  he was going to do anything he wanted to do to you and then also it stopped doctors from
[35:21.440 --> 35:27.200]  experimenting or it can if you know if you know the code and you can stand up for yourself like
[35:27.200 --> 35:33.360]  a good american or free person then the code also says that you can't do any anything experimental
[35:33.360 --> 35:36.800]  that's going to cause death or disability that's something that people should look up i think if
[35:36.800 --> 35:42.960]  you guys cover it a lot obviously it's gonna be a bigger microphone than i have well you're
[35:42.960 --> 35:49.120]  absolutely right and they had the nuremberg trials where the nazis were found guilty of
[35:49.120 --> 35:55.040]  war crimes and they were sentenced to death the leadership they said well we followed the fjords
[35:55.040 --> 36:01.120]  orders just following orders so nuremberg found no just following orders does not protect you from
[36:01.120 --> 36:08.880]  following legal orders and you're right that's where we get the precursor to the geneba convention
[36:10.240 --> 36:16.000]  and in the geneba convention it says that you cannot test things on people unless you have
[36:16.000 --> 36:22.800]  informed consent and they agree because of what joseph mingela and the nazis did and so what you're
[36:22.800 --> 36:30.080]  saying is incredibly important and of course joseph mingela was the angel of death and they
[36:30.080 --> 36:35.520]  did medical experiments including force inoculations uh on the old and the mentally ill and of course
[36:35.520 --> 36:39.280]  they were really killing them they would inject them and say it was a vaccine they would then die
[36:39.280 --> 36:46.240]  and this is how the murder started by 34 35 36 it was the medical corps that was doing it and it
[36:46.240 --> 36:52.160]  would be doctors at the the death camps that would oversee with ibm computers called the
[36:52.160 --> 36:56.800]  hollereth machine and as long as the computer said they would just enter in the computer
[36:56.800 --> 37:03.040]  pre pre-programmed codes and then the computer would say work these to death keep these alive go
[37:03.040 --> 37:08.000]  ahead and kill these immediately that's why people had the uh the death camp and forced labor camp
[37:08.000 --> 37:13.600]  people did have the tattoo on them that was a ibm machine code and so what you're bringing
[37:13.600 --> 37:18.800]  up is absolutely central this is mass medical illegal experimentation they skipped animal trials
[37:18.800 --> 37:23.120]  they admit 80 percent are getting sick with the vaccine test under bill gates but they're saying
[37:23.120 --> 37:29.120]  we have to submit and to get on an airplane and have a medical id or have a job this is the new
[37:29.120 --> 37:33.040]  model and the governor northam that used to run the baby harvesting program that says they keep
[37:33.040 --> 37:37.200]  babies alive and harvest their organs keep them comfortable he's the one saying we're coming with
[37:37.200 --> 37:42.480]  force inoculations and with a digital id on your phone all of that's being rolled out in
[37:42.480 --> 37:48.880]  virginia right now is the model unbelievably evil my friend if i may alex are you there yes go ahead
[37:48.880 --> 37:53.680]  okay uh one of the biggest things that i that i hear one of the biggest slides and you guys are
[37:53.680 --> 37:58.400]  good at pointing out but i i want to definitely tell the people of info wars this uh to spread the
[37:58.400 --> 38:04.080]  the good news is that america is not a democracy america is a republic and that distinction is so
[38:04.080 --> 38:10.160]  important in our supreme law of the land the u.s constitution in article four section four states
[38:10.160 --> 38:16.720]  that every state shall have a republican form of government and that democracy was never the
[38:16.720 --> 38:20.800]  democracy was never even put in the constitution or founding documents and that was for a good
[38:20.800 --> 38:25.840]  reason because founding fathers knew that democracies were one step away from tyranny and the tyranny of
[38:25.840 --> 38:31.840]  majority where a republic which is latin for res public means the rule of the law instead of democracy
[38:31.840 --> 38:36.640]  which means rule of the people which sounds good but when when the end of happening is people think
[38:36.640 --> 38:40.160]  that it's great and so you have eight out of ten people saying we're going to take your car we're
[38:40.160 --> 38:44.080]  going to take your your daughter or and do all these things and it's perfectly legal in a democracy
[38:44.080 --> 38:47.840]  where republic you have a rule law everyone has to follow you have a a right to property
[38:47.840 --> 38:53.920]  and all those things so i i i um i implore everyone to look at article four of six or section four
[38:53.920 --> 38:58.640]  of article four of the u.s constitution know that so anytime you hear the weird democracy
[38:58.640 --> 39:02.240]  or they were spreading democracy around the world no we're not we're a republic and that's a great
[39:02.240 --> 39:07.840]  thing and democracy is one step away from the majority uh the tyranny of the majority
[39:07.840 --> 39:13.600]  you're absolutely right sir and you're very well informed and that's why they hate the
[39:13.600 --> 39:18.240]  military and the police because out of the general public you guys have learned the basic
[39:18.240 --> 39:22.800]  bill of rights and constitution compared to the public and so that's why you're the enemy you
[39:22.800 --> 39:30.080]  represent old american institutions that aren't perfect but are like ice water in the sahara desert
[39:30.080 --> 39:35.520]  compared to the poison the globalists are foisting upon us amazing points yes this is all illegal
[39:35.520 --> 39:40.880]  under the nuremberg code and under the geneva convention that came out of the nuremberg trials
[39:40.880 --> 39:45.840]  i bless your mic in the u.s military but god help us if they get control of the military
[39:46.560 --> 39:50.240]  we will then have to go to war with it won't we and the police so the police better know that
[39:50.240 --> 39:56.560]  if you let the left take over police you'll have to fight us it was a sleeper product it wasn't
[39:56.560 --> 40:01.440]  popular at first but as people tried it it's become one of our top five best sellers i'm talking

[43:08.240 --> 43:14.880]  and billa melinda gates it is beyond critical it is life and death for you and your family to
[43:14.880 --> 43:20.400]  understand no matter where you live on the planet but this is a worldwide world government takeover
[43:20.400 --> 43:27.280]  on record that it's never going to end the united nations has admitted that first it's a month then
[43:27.280 --> 43:32.720]  it's six months then they say okay it's two years they're now saying two years they're now saying
[43:32.720 --> 43:39.040]  you'll never go back to normal no more gatherings no more anything constant forced inoculations
[43:39.040 --> 43:45.200]  that they admit don't even work and the way they say they work they change your dna this is the
[43:45.200 --> 43:50.560]  culling of the planet this is the beginning of a straight jacket being put on you before you're

[44:04.000 --> 44:16.240]  president trump is now speaking live in charlotte north carolina we now take you live
[44:16.240 --> 44:28.640]  if you want to really drive them crazy you say 12 more years
[44:33.760 --> 44:40.080]  we caught them doing some really bad things in 2016 let's see what happens we caught them
[44:40.080 --> 44:44.000]  doing some really bad things we have to be very careful because they're trying it again
[44:44.000 --> 44:51.520]  and with this whole 80 million mail-in ballots that they're working on sending them out to people
[44:51.520 --> 44:57.600]  that didn't ask for them they didn't ask they just get them and it's not fair and it's not right
[44:57.600 --> 45:03.760]  and it's not going to be possible to tabulate in my opinion it's just my opinion we have to be
[45:03.760 --> 45:09.200]  very very careful and you have to watch every one of you you have to watch because bad things
[45:09.200 --> 45:14.880]  happened last time with the spine on our campaign and that goes to biden and that goes to obama
[45:15.680 --> 45:21.440]  and we have to be very very careful to be very very careful and this time they're trying to do it
[45:21.440 --> 45:26.320]  with the whole post office scam they'll blame it on the post office you could see them setting it up
[45:27.040 --> 45:32.160]  be very careful and watch it very carefully because we have to win this is the most important
[45:32.160 --> 45:39.600]  election in the history of our country this is the most you know for for a long period of time
[45:41.200 --> 45:45.760]  i would say well 2016 how special was that evening was that one of the great
[45:46.960 --> 45:51.440]  that was one of the great evenings but we have to be very very careful and we have to win
[45:52.800 --> 45:59.360]  our country is counting on it this is the biggest this is it our country can go in a horrible
[45:59.360 --> 46:07.120]  horrible direction or in an even greater direction and before the plague came in from china that's
[46:07.120 --> 46:12.480]  where we were going we were going in a direction like we had never seen the most successful economy
[46:13.440 --> 46:20.640]  in the history of our country the best unemployment numbers in history for african-american
[46:20.640 --> 46:30.080]  asian-american ispanic-american women college students bad students good students everybody
[46:30.800 --> 46:35.360]  if you had a diploma if you didn't have a diploma it didn't matter you were doing well
[46:36.000 --> 46:42.880]  everybody was doing well and we were actually coming together you know success brings people
[46:42.880 --> 46:48.480]  together maybe better than anything else success brings people so many times they say we're divided
[46:48.480 --> 46:54.480]  well we were very divided under president obama very divided people have no idea how divided
[46:55.040 --> 47:00.480]  they didn't talk about it as much they didn't say it as much but we were really coming together
[47:01.360 --> 47:07.360]  and i was speaking with democrats all of a sudden because the success the markets were at an all
[47:07.360 --> 47:12.240]  time high and by the way take a look at what's happening with the markets take a look at your
[47:12.240 --> 47:19.040]  401k's which you probably do every hour take a look at your stocks we're very close to breaking
[47:19.040 --> 47:26.640]  the record and nasdaq has already done it you know nasdaq has broken the record i think 16 times
[47:26.640 --> 47:36.240]  already during a pandemic hopefully we'll call it the final phase of a pandemic you know biden
[47:36.240 --> 47:43.680]  the other day said no he'd shut it down he'd listen to some guy say and he'd shut it down we just
[47:43.680 --> 47:50.000]  broke a record on jobs an all-time record there's never been three months where we've
[47:50.000 --> 47:56.080]  put more people to work over nine million people and again we're just about ready to break the
[47:56.080 --> 48:04.080]  all-time stock market red record i mean you look at it we're just about ready to do it again let's
[48:04.080 --> 48:08.800]  stop right there we're gonna come back to more of this it's live right now we're gonna pause it
[48:08.800 --> 48:11.840]  we'll go back to more of it but i want to get to the calls and make you front and center but
[48:12.640 --> 48:18.080]  everything he's saying is totally true and the corrupt deep state that sold us out to china
[48:18.080 --> 48:22.000]  that does not believe this country should exist that wants a global currency that wants to get us
[48:22.000 --> 48:27.440]  out of the way and then bring in their new older values that if you think our police have got problems
[48:27.440 --> 48:35.680]  and our governments have problems our government is a fantasy land wonderland heaven system compared
[48:35.680 --> 48:41.760]  to communist china in places like that my god everybody knows that and so you think our system
[48:41.760 --> 48:49.120]  has problems yeah that's called due process it's got its own issues and of course we become a
[48:49.120 --> 48:54.960]  decadent slob like nation not all of us but a lot of us myself included i mean i could talk about
[48:54.960 --> 48:58.320]  how we need to be tough and strong and in shape and everything but i'm i like to eat a whole
[48:58.320 --> 49:04.720]  pizza as much as the next guy the difference is i can recognize i got problems compared to other
[49:04.720 --> 49:09.920]  people that just don't care and live in la la land and they think they're on a bandwagon of what's
[49:09.920 --> 49:15.040]  popular hating the president hating america when they're literally on the bandwagon funded by the
[49:15.040 --> 49:20.400]  eu the globalist goldman sacks jp morgan the chai comms that think this country was done
[49:20.400 --> 49:25.360]  that want to totally enslave you and trump doesn't think you're done
[49:27.760 --> 49:32.560]  that's trumps immo by the way buying old beautiful post offices and resorts and buildings that nobody
[49:32.560 --> 49:34.800]  wants and turning them back into something beautiful
[49:37.840 --> 49:42.720]  and trump does love america and i love america too especially when i'm the type of evil that
[49:42.720 --> 49:50.480]  wants control of it absolutely satanic evil that's bottomless and it has it has no remorse no nothing
[49:50.480 --> 49:56.240]  he just wants power control i want to go to ray in georgia says doctors are waking up well yeah
[49:56.240 --> 50:00.480]  the u n admits most doctors don't like vaccines so this is all this doubling down we're okay we're

[52:29.200 --> 52:34.480]  i mean it's just amazing what you what you guys guys have been able to accomplish um my father-in-law
[52:34.480 --> 52:41.680]  he's a he's a doctor he's an md um and he's you know when when my children were born we were like
[52:41.680 --> 52:45.520]  you know we're not going to do we're not we're going to do an alternate schedule of vaccines and
[52:45.520 --> 52:51.680]  then my son had kind of an adverse reaction and um and so we so let's be clear you did even less
[52:51.680 --> 52:57.760]  than they recommended your son had a problem yeah yeah well you know i i can't like totally
[52:57.760 --> 53:02.800]  attributed to it but we were just like we saw like something you know something wasn't wasn't
[53:02.800 --> 53:06.560]  right and so we just yeah it's like a cobra bite see me die you're not sure the cobra did it but
[53:06.560 --> 53:12.560]  it looks like it did yeah yeah right so so you know my father-in-law you know thought we were crazy
[53:12.560 --> 53:17.920]  well you know kind of comes full circle now because like you know the the doctors have to take every
[53:17.920 --> 53:23.120]  every shot right and he's like i don't even want to take this thing you know it's like being rushed
[53:23.120 --> 53:30.000]  to market it's like you know it's crazy well you know doctors have the third lowest uh lifespan
[53:30.000 --> 53:37.600]  in the united states it goes gay men black men doctors and then if any profession doctors live
[53:37.600 --> 53:44.640]  less long lives than combat vets you you know why because they make oh guess who's next nurses
[53:44.640 --> 53:49.280]  they make the nurses and the doctors take them all and it brain damages them and it kills them
[53:49.280 --> 53:54.080]  not to mention the obesity rates i mean the nurses come in super skinny at the beginning
[53:54.080 --> 53:59.120]  and then like by the end you know they're like 400 pounds not not even a good vaccine lowers
[53:59.120 --> 54:04.000]  your immunity to other pathogens okay it'll teach you how to beat one thing but what the other has
[54:04.000 --> 54:08.640]  all the side effects all the additives all the things that contaminate them but the new ones
[54:08.640 --> 54:14.400]  are beyond that i mean now they want us to take a hundred shots you know i mean yeah exactly so so
[54:14.400 --> 54:18.080]  hold on don't hang up i want to come back to you because i want to take your little story here

[58:39.760 --> 58:45.280]  taught this in psychophysiology program that if you get to a child between ages one and six
[58:45.280 --> 58:51.040]  or one or eight especially with sexual abuse or sexual trauma you will split their personality
[58:51.040 --> 58:57.040]  and they will be imprinted the rest of their life and many times that results in split personalities
[58:57.040 --> 59:01.760]  and disassociated behavior and other things and that's why it takes critical thinking that people
[59:01.760 --> 59:06.320]  have got to look at this stuff critically and see what they're being fed so they can cross
[59:06.320 --> 59:10.800]  that psychological line that they just refuse to to see it when it's right in front of them people

[1:02:16.880 --> 1:02:22.400]  get colds or the flu they're creating artificial phobias for normal death that takes place
[1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:28.240]  they're not even promising to have a cure to it all they're just inflicting new phobias on everyone
[1:02:28.240 --> 1:02:34.000]  to bring in their planetary regime directed by the who with vaccines that actually change
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:42.320]  your dna and make you owned by microsoft it's a final frontier it's the year 2020
[1:02:43.680 --> 1:02:49.920]  it's not coming it's here and submission is blood in the water
[1:02:49.920 --> 1:02:53.920]  you
[1:02:53.920 --> 1:03:13.920]  you
[1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:35.920]  you
[1:03:42.560 --> 1:03:45.840]  all right so if you just joined us we're into the second hour here on this
[1:03:46.640 --> 1:03:52.000]  august 24th monday edition the president gave a surprise speech it's ongoing he was going to speak
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:56.960]  the other nights of the convention he's very smart he'd do this to counter all the disinformation
[1:03:56.960 --> 1:04:01.600]  and propaganda cnn has announced they're going to be breaking into all of his speeches and fact
[1:04:01.600 --> 1:04:06.960]  checking it something that they didn't do of course at the dnc trump's not going with the
[1:04:06.960 --> 1:04:12.560]  virtual cult event where everybody stays 20 feet from each other it's now six feet isn't enough
[1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:17.680]  and wear the stupid mask so he's being aroundly criticized for that but they're having the mtv
[1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:22.880]  awards in new york and the governor put a waiver on the 14-day quarantine for them just not for the
[1:04:22.880 --> 1:04:30.480]  nra or for police rallies but why do you follow what that criminal says but it's about the naked
[1:04:30.480 --> 1:04:37.280]  exercise of power where governor newson keeps his restaurants and wineries open when everybody else
[1:04:37.280 --> 1:04:44.240]  is closed he's just statewide change just like governor life it goes of course i get security
[1:04:44.240 --> 1:04:48.960]  at my house i'm important and i get to go out and get my haircut i'm a public figure you don't
[1:04:49.920 --> 1:04:55.360]  like well that's incredible hypocrisy they're like of course it is we're rubbing your face in it so
[1:04:55.360 --> 1:05:00.480]  i'll go back to trump's speech and back to your calls but we're talking to ray who said his son
[1:05:01.760 --> 1:05:06.000]  you know seemed to have an adverse reaction even though they did the reduced vaccine
[1:05:07.200 --> 1:05:12.960]  roster a child's not going to have intravenous drug use or anal sex to get hepatitis so why
[1:05:12.960 --> 1:05:17.120]  do they give them that it's a really serious vaccine that messes the kids up and studies
[1:05:17.120 --> 1:05:20.560]  well why are they giving little girls garters little shots that don't even protect you from
[1:05:20.560 --> 1:05:24.480]  him and papillomavirus there's thousands of varieties to protect you from four
[1:05:24.480 --> 1:05:31.120]  well it attacks your ovaries that's why it's sterilization uh why why do you do this none
[1:05:31.120 --> 1:05:36.320]  of the vaccines protect you except tetanus it's been proven to work and be effective but
[1:05:37.200 --> 1:05:41.280]  they can add hormones to it so then your body has an autoimmune response that hormone
[1:05:41.280 --> 1:05:46.480]  so that women can never have babies look into it so with the whole history of secret experimentation
[1:05:46.480 --> 1:05:52.320]  who would you trust in these big companies to do this and then gate says that he has liability
[1:05:52.320 --> 1:05:56.720]  protection and he says it's going to hurt a bunch of people so you were then bringing up your father
[1:05:56.720 --> 1:06:01.840]  in law who's a doctor just finish up your story saying he doesn't want to take all these vaccines
[1:06:01.840 --> 1:06:06.800]  because for the doctors they do say it's mandatory go ahead yeah with i with this whole thing i mean
[1:06:06.800 --> 1:06:11.920]  it's really opened the doctor's eyes to a lot of it and it's kind of retroactively made them start
[1:06:11.920 --> 1:06:17.520]  looking back into the previous vaccine what it did was it made him go and research you know that
[1:06:17.520 --> 1:06:23.760]  there's aborted fetal cells in the you know in in the vaccine and once he did that he's like well
[1:06:23.760 --> 1:06:29.840]  you know my catholic catholic belief you know that that goes against everything that that i believe
[1:06:29.840 --> 1:06:36.000]  in you know and so so it's really you know the doctors are are waking up you know the the religious
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:42.240]  ones are going what the heck you know so you know that's that was kind of my point um you know if i
[1:06:42.240 --> 1:06:45.920]  could get onto i've got a couple other points if i could bring up sir i want to hear from you but i
[1:06:45.920 --> 1:06:51.600]  gotta move i appreciate your call great points i gotta get to everybody else great caller listen
[1:06:53.840 --> 1:06:59.920]  your catholic beliefs are right the judae beliefs are right christian beliefs that you don't put
[1:06:59.920 --> 1:07:08.320]  foreign blood into you you don't mix the seed they figured out back then hey don't eat certain
[1:07:08.320 --> 1:07:12.800]  animals and we now know because they carry diseases people had laws they had common sense
[1:07:14.480 --> 1:07:21.440]  and so when you put aborted fetal tissue into somebody your body then starts having
[1:07:21.440 --> 1:07:28.640]  autoimmune responses to itself because if you're becoming immune because there's an adjuvant
[1:07:28.640 --> 1:07:34.080]  that causes you to have a bigger immune response to the pathogen let's say
[1:07:35.840 --> 1:07:42.640]  tetanus strain but there's other genetic material in there a lot of vaccines were
[1:07:42.640 --> 1:07:47.200]  grown on peanuts everybody knows until about 50 years ago there was no peanut allergies by the
[1:07:47.200 --> 1:07:51.520]  90s thousands of kids were dying a year in the us alone and they learned it was because they
[1:07:51.520 --> 1:08:02.640]  grew a vaccine an mmr vaccine on peanuts for a while a peanut protein okay so it's all sorts
[1:08:02.640 --> 1:08:08.000]  of stuff going on i mean they grow them on eggs they grow them on on blood from monkeys i mean
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:14.080]  it's it's dangerous folks and then you get all that other genetic material and then your body
[1:08:14.080 --> 1:08:18.720]  has problems with it has an autoimmune response to it all right i didn't mean to cut the color
[1:08:18.720 --> 1:08:23.680]  short i'll just never get to ray and austin and douglas and matt and michael and charlie and erin
[1:08:23.680 --> 1:08:27.680]  and todd and joseph even in this hour if i don't start doing it because we need to hear more from
[1:08:27.680 --> 1:08:31.840]  the president so i had him live earlier i hit pause to take a few calls going to break let's
[1:08:31.840 --> 1:08:36.640]  listen a little bit of what trump was talking about going to war with the deep state obama
[1:08:36.640 --> 1:08:40.000]  trying to steal the election they're trying to steal it again they're sending out 80 million
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:44.880]  ballots to confuse everything yeah there's no way that could ever be counted properly it's being
[1:08:44.880 --> 1:08:49.760]  randomly sent out this is how they contest the election by sabotaging it and then when trump
[1:08:49.760 --> 1:08:54.080]  fights them they say he's a dictator it's going to happen it's their strategy and then they're
[1:08:54.080 --> 1:08:57.520]  going to activate race riots all over the country what are we going to do about it here's the president
[1:08:58.480 --> 1:09:06.640]  28 billion dollars because they were targeted by china i got the farmers 28 billion dollars 16 and 12
[1:09:08.960 --> 1:09:14.080]  that's why so in spite of the pandemic and our farmers did a great job in supplying food and
[1:09:14.080 --> 1:09:21.280]  all of the difficulties during this period of time but uh we're getting ready to do things like
[1:09:21.280 --> 1:09:27.440]  nobody's ever seen before but the best way to bring unity is success success brings unity
[1:09:27.440 --> 1:09:33.600]  and we were there and then we got hit with the plague but we won't forget that i just want to
[1:09:33.600 --> 1:09:38.960]  thank the people of north carolina because to be honest with you i felt an obligation to be here
[1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:46.560]  uh you have a governor who's in a total shutdown mood i guarantee on november 4th it'll all open up
[1:09:46.560 --> 1:09:53.680]  it'll be fine like most other states on november 4th you know these democrat governors they love
[1:09:53.680 --> 1:09:58.480]  shutdown until after the elections over because they want to make our numbers look as bad as possible
[1:09:58.480 --> 1:10:03.440]  for the economy but our numbers are looking so good and frankly i used to say a v and people would
[1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:08.160]  say well maybe not i don't think so this is gold he needs to directly attack them they're the enemy
[1:10:08.160 --> 1:10:13.920]  they're doing it all they're criminals damn right looking like it's a super v uh yes our automobile
[1:10:13.920 --> 1:10:19.360]  numbers are incredible both used cars and brand new cars our manufacturing numbers incredible
[1:10:19.360 --> 1:10:24.160]  we're putting a lot of manufacturing jobs to work that the previous administration said you'd need
[1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:30.240]  a magic wand you'd need a magic wand for manufacturing jobs i don't think so i guess we had the magic
[1:10:30.240 --> 1:10:34.480]  wand that's all but we're putting them again we're putting it back we're bringing them back
[1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:40.240]  back but think of your life just prior to the plague coming in it was the best it's ever been
[1:10:40.240 --> 1:10:47.200]  your state had the best numbers they've ever had ever had by far and we had the best employment
[1:10:47.200 --> 1:10:55.680]  numbers also we were up to 160 million jobs we were never anywhere near that and then we had
[1:10:55.680 --> 1:11:01.200]  to shut it down we saved millions and millions of lives we learned the enemy we learned all about
[1:11:01.200 --> 1:11:09.680]  the invisible enemy how it affects really people that are older especially older people the elderly
[1:11:09.680 --> 1:11:17.680]  but older people with problems with heart with diabetes with other problems and we learned and
[1:11:19.120 --> 1:11:25.280]  most of the country is right now doing very very well they've done an incredible job and to have a
[1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:30.560]  man sitting on television the other day say oh i'd shut it down oh i'd shut it like it's easy
[1:11:30.560 --> 1:11:35.040]  shut it down and by the way when you shut it down and we did the exact right thing we shut it down
[1:11:35.040 --> 1:11:38.560]  then we reopened and that's what we're doing now we're well into it but
[1:11:42.640 --> 1:11:49.760]  if we didn't shut it down at that point we would have had millions of people dead millions of people
[1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:55.280]  he's going on the official story the job that mike penson the task force and all of us together
[1:11:55.280 --> 1:12:01.040]  have done has been incredible what we've done what we've achieved whether it's ventilators
[1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:05.600]  whether it's supplying equipment to governors that were totally ill-prepared many of the governors
[1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:10.160]  we know that most the public still buys the official hoax they may think it's over-exaggerated
[1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:14.400]  but they still buy into you know billions are gonna die if we don't do this and then of course
[1:12:14.400 --> 1:12:18.160]  none of it happened because it was all fraud and then they they didn't release the clamp down after
[1:12:18.160 --> 1:12:24.560]  because they never wanted to go and look they made the clamp down more intense up front because
[1:12:24.560 --> 1:12:28.720]  they wanted to hurt the economy and punish nationals but they always had this thing on the shelf they
[1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:33.760]  admit it this is the post-industrial world this is the clamp down all right we'll skip ahead of him
[1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:37.280]  getting into the virus i want him to get into the election other areas but we're gonna take your
[1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:42.160]  calls when we come back on how do we stop the deep state because you know they got some curve balls

[1:15:29.680 --> 1:15:34.240]  hey man so um yeah i'm in virginia and i saw this morning you posted on a band
[1:15:34.240 --> 1:15:39.280]  that video that they're doing a mandatory vaccinations here yes that's his hoax he
[1:15:39.280 --> 1:15:43.200]  calls a mandatory but you still have all the laws that say they can't force you to but
[1:15:43.200 --> 1:15:47.440]  they're going to attempt to say it's mandatory well yeah of course i mean i'm not going to get it
[1:15:47.440 --> 1:15:54.560]  myself there i'll be on hot pursuit before they get me but um yeah but in virginia i feel like
[1:15:54.560 --> 1:16:00.800]  i'm the only one not wearing a mask now um um because i'm pretty close to northern virginia
[1:16:00.800 --> 1:16:05.920]  there's a lot of federal buildings around here and um there's a lot of sympathy for northen too but
[1:16:07.040 --> 1:16:12.480]  i think a lot of people are scared to speak out out here and um they're just closeted in and
[1:16:12.480 --> 1:16:17.200]  some people are scared to not wear masks but um i just wanted to say uh
[1:16:19.280 --> 1:16:23.280]  i mean i know the lords with me so i don't fear well here's the bottom line brother
[1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:34.480]  depending on whose statistics you look at it's 0.0032 i keep removing a zero it's it's 0.0032
[1:16:35.760 --> 1:16:41.680]  of people that get it it's a hoax it's all lies about ventilators and full hospitals and all this
[1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:46.160]  there's always people dying of respiratory illnesses so they just make a big deal out of each one
[1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:51.200]  and then have headlines like men who wear a face mask or sexier or into u.s women
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:58.480]  in some stupid poll they put out it's all garbage sir it's a hysteria weapon god bless
[1:16:58.480 --> 1:17:05.520]  you be safe up in virginia speak out be a leader we went down to barton springs
[1:17:05.520 --> 1:17:12.640]  we had about 300 people there shut down park beautiful open springs and of course the police
[1:17:12.640 --> 1:17:17.840]  didn't do anything because they knew we were in the right and it was just so good to be around
[1:17:17.840 --> 1:17:24.640]  300 people not wearing mask as long as i have my zinc a vitamin d3 i'm in the sun if i don't have
[1:17:24.640 --> 1:17:30.720]  those i'll die of any virus any virus will kill you when you don't have an essential
[1:17:30.720 --> 1:17:35.440]  so if a vitamin or mineral is essential
[1:17:39.360 --> 1:17:40.560]  it means you have to have it to live
[1:17:43.120 --> 1:17:47.360]  iodine is essential x2 is pure iodine most the iodine out there isn't absorbed properly
[1:17:48.400 --> 1:17:52.320]  so that's why this is a life-saving situation they want you ignorant and dumb and sick
[1:17:53.280 --> 1:17:57.360]  like somebody took my x2 off my table somebody do me a favor bring my x2 bottle back

[1:18:46.160 --> 1:18:53.760]  tyrannical authority well for us it is the exercise of resistance i mean we would need to train
[1:18:53.760 --> 1:19:00.240]  ourselves to resist all the strong arming and everything like that all the shaming that will
[1:19:00.240 --> 1:19:08.080]  get you to wear a mask the social distancing we need to resist all that stuff up front and train

[1:19:29.120 --> 1:19:34.640]  important election us history we have an outside group working with foreign powers trying to overthrow

[1:19:41.440 --> 1:19:45.520]  and americans will resonate with that so we're going to take that first few minutes of his speech
[1:19:46.160 --> 1:19:51.760]  put it out on band dot video in the next 20 minutes and i want to go viral viral viral because
[1:19:51.760 --> 1:19:58.880]  he and he says i need all of you to warn everyone and to watch for election fraud he's calling on us
[1:19:58.880 --> 1:20:04.720]  invoking the people he i mean this is it man this is the traders and the collaborators and the
[1:20:04.720 --> 1:20:09.280]  global is working together to end this country as we know it and bring us to our knees are we

[1:20:50.880 --> 1:20:56.720]  organs man i and they want to send contact tracers just like australia and europe and just grab you
[1:20:56.720 --> 1:21:00.720]  out of your house saying you did something wrong it's the perfect cover for their snatch and grabs
[1:21:00.720 --> 1:21:04.960]  this is it they're coming the rocker feller foundation admits it this is it just like
[1:21:04.960 --> 1:21:09.120]  trump said just like you said this is it it's the main assault i've been telling people now
[1:21:09.120 --> 1:21:14.240]  trump's saying it good people know the truth and what's her number one mission suppress your speech
[1:21:14.240 --> 1:21:19.520]  suppress doctors and scientists and shows like this exposing it that's why you got to take the
[1:21:19.520 --> 1:21:24.800]  feed from mandat video your local radio station or tv station and tell people tune in now this is
[1:21:24.800 --> 1:21:30.320]  what they don't want you to hear and people understand that thank you ryan all right matt
[1:21:30.320 --> 1:21:36.080]  in connecticut than douglas and others matt you're on the air hey alex first i'm calder
[1:21:36.080 --> 1:21:41.200]  longtime listener uh first of all i want to say thank you for building such an amazing platform
[1:21:41.200 --> 1:21:46.160]  for citizens you know from all walks of life to really be frontline soldiers in the info war
[1:21:46.160 --> 1:21:50.080]  well it's not about us taking credit but it's about this i knew this the takeover was coming
[1:21:50.080 --> 1:21:53.920]  i knew the internet kills which was coming we we said we need to build this listeners
[1:21:53.920 --> 1:21:57.840]  because there's gonna be a total censorship of the web and we need to have our own platform
[1:21:57.840 --> 1:22:03.120]  because i was reading their own documents that's what i'm telling it's not me i read these powerful
[1:22:03.120 --> 1:22:08.560]  people's plan they're in charge i believe we could beat them so isn't it crazy that we're on air
[1:22:08.560 --> 1:22:14.080]  and we still have this platform and in ways is bigger than ever it's amazing and i could say
[1:22:14.080 --> 1:22:19.920]  that info wars you know has been more crucial to my my learning and education shaping my worldview
[1:22:19.920 --> 1:22:24.400]  and i studied at you know an ivy league school i had my graduate degree in economics and
[1:22:24.400 --> 1:22:30.320]  international relations but i've been listening to info wars since i'm 18 years old and everything
[1:22:30.320 --> 1:22:34.560]  you know that you're laying out there for the people um it's on point uh you know we're at a
[1:22:34.560 --> 1:22:39.760]  crucial point you know we really need to to take up you know some sort of fight now whether it's
[1:22:39.760 --> 1:22:45.680]  with information or or standing your ground because you know from a socioeconomic perspective
[1:22:46.560 --> 1:22:50.720]  it's it's not going to be pretty coming up if you just look at it at the base that's what
[1:22:50.720 --> 1:22:53.440]  communists do i'm gonna hold you over to finish your point and then we've got a guest coming

[1:29:19.760 --> 1:29:24.880]  they go i'm awake this is a hoax it's all a big giant fraud and like what do they all say what do
[1:29:24.880 --> 1:29:30.080]  we do what do we do so what do we do exactly and that's what i'm wondering you know we have little
[1:29:30.080 --> 1:29:34.960]  pockets of you know there's 10 10 people here 10 people there but with the quarantine no one could
[1:29:34.960 --> 1:29:39.200]  really talk to each other and that's what i noticed when i was at this event is you had everyone kind
[1:29:39.200 --> 1:29:43.840]  of sitting in the corner you know feeling it out you know should i bring this up with this person
[1:29:43.840 --> 1:29:47.840]  and by the end of it everyone kind of knows what's going on and it's really a joke i mean
[1:29:48.480 --> 1:29:53.120]  if they ask the american people how they felt about this if they ask you know a lot of the guys out
[1:29:53.120 --> 1:29:58.480]  there that are just i would say normal you know american guys no one is going along with this
[1:29:58.480 --> 1:30:05.120]  stuff it's fascism it's communism and both of them suck exactly but it's a centralized medical tyranny
[1:30:05.120 --> 1:30:10.400]  and as more doctors force inoculate as more people die there'll be a bigger incentive to cover it up
[1:30:10.400 --> 1:30:14.640]  that's how corruption works that's that's how pedophilia took over the vatican is that once
[1:30:14.640 --> 1:30:19.360]  they're able to corrupt you and get you to not do anything then the full depth of the corruption
[1:30:19.920 --> 1:30:24.720]  comes that's why everybody's got to promote band.video and info wars.com and news wars.com if all
[1:30:24.720 --> 1:30:29.200]  the audience here realizes that hey everybody's waking up but here's the place that has got all
[1:30:29.200 --> 1:30:34.000]  the information then we can break the globalist will and we're very very close to doing it that's
[1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:40.160]  why this whole covid lockdown attack is a doubling down because their system was going down and again
[1:30:40.160 --> 1:30:44.720]  i don't just say that we saw the un meetings last year where they said our hoax is going down our
[1:30:44.720 --> 1:30:49.920]  doctors don't believe it we've got to stop these inoculations and then boom the group above the
[1:30:49.920 --> 1:30:55.040]  un releases the weapon to make the un the hero and to shut up their own detractors all right
[1:30:55.040 --> 1:31:01.920]  drew hernandez joins us ahead of savannah hernandez and greg reese coming in the studio next hour
[1:31:01.920 --> 1:31:08.480]  we'll have calls then he is a host investigative reporter producer of the hit web show lives matter
[1:31:08.480 --> 1:31:13.840]  he's been on tucker carlson you name it and he's at lives matter show youtube lives matter
[1:31:13.840 --> 1:31:19.440]  while he's talking we'll roll some of the incredible footage he got in wisconsin last night
[1:31:19.440 --> 1:31:23.520]  but i think it's best is to go to him and give him the floor to describe exactly what he saw and
[1:31:23.520 --> 1:31:28.160]  what this was like and i'm glad you're all in one piece my friend armed men coming up and stopping
[1:31:28.160 --> 1:31:36.640]  police vehicles burning down buildings uh churches and gas stations i mean what have you witnessed
[1:31:38.080 --> 1:31:45.920]  thanks for having me alex it is absolute total lawlessness anarchy and it's obvious that these
[1:31:45.920 --> 1:31:52.640]  marxist agendas are now beginning to play out um in our real world when i showed up last night
[1:31:53.280 --> 1:31:58.000]  literally right when i showed up there's a gigantic there's like three huge garbage trucks
[1:31:58.000 --> 1:32:04.160]  just lined up on fire and then out of nowhere there's this police squad truck that's being
[1:32:04.160 --> 1:32:10.160]  surrounded by black lives matter militants armed with it appeared to be ar-15s multiple
[1:32:10.800 --> 1:32:15.280]  literally just pointing them at the police officers as if they are policing the police as
[1:32:15.280 --> 1:32:21.200]  if there's some kind of new shadow police that's policing the streets um and last night alex it
[1:32:21.200 --> 1:32:27.120]  was literally just one thing after another the mob just moves they just move from one business
[1:32:27.120 --> 1:32:31.920]  to the next charge type of thing you know like they just point to one after the next let's loot
[1:32:31.920 --> 1:32:38.560]  this one let's loot that one and alex all i heard last night all i heard was black lives matter
[1:32:38.560 --> 1:32:42.960]  black lives matter they're spray painting it on the walls and that's all you hear throughout the
[1:32:42.960 --> 1:32:49.360]  entire night and i'm sick of people like president brock obama lying through his teeth at the dnc
[1:32:49.360 --> 1:32:55.040]  convention saying that protests like these are peaceful this is the kind of stuff that is literally
[1:32:55.040 --> 1:32:58.960]  damaging america because you have a former president of the united states which we all know
[1:32:58.960 --> 1:33:04.400]  is a deep state globalist plant that's attempting to lie to people and the world that these are
[1:33:04.400 --> 1:33:09.600]  peaceful protesters i mean what more evidence do you need alex what more evidence do we need to
[1:33:09.600 --> 1:33:15.040]  show the world that this is a marxist agenda there's something behind it they're funded they're
[1:33:15.040 --> 1:33:19.920]  protected because they're minorities and i can come out and say that it's a bunch of baloney alex
[1:33:19.920 --> 1:33:24.560]  that just because people are black or just because people are brown that they're protected from their
[1:33:24.560 --> 1:33:30.240]  criminal activity they should be condemned not because of skin color not because of race but
[1:33:30.240 --> 1:33:35.200]  because of their actions and that's what these people need to understand you don't get a pass to
[1:33:35.200 --> 1:33:40.320]  act like a criminal just because the color of your skin that's not how it works sure i'm not
[1:33:40.320 --> 1:33:44.960]  giving i'm not giving black and brown folks a pass there are some bad folks but it seems like a
[1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:49.600]  bunch of weird uh like kind of hippy white people like the guy with the assault weapon pointing at
[1:33:49.600 --> 1:33:54.480]  the cops it seems like they're kind of in command is that is that not accurate yeah and yeah that's
[1:33:54.480 --> 1:33:59.360]  something you do notice like the antifa thugs you know that are like wannabe soldiers uh you know
[1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:04.560]  they should have joined the marines or the navy but they do seem to lead uh some of the black lives
[1:34:04.560 --> 1:34:09.280]  matter gathering sometimes you'll see if you notice in footage you'll see the white people always up in
[1:34:09.280 --> 1:34:14.720]  the front uh because they're leading it or they're shielding black people it it does seem like it's
[1:34:14.720 --> 1:34:19.920]  still uh led by white people and it's just it's very interesting that they allow that because
[1:34:19.920 --> 1:34:25.520]  they claim to be i believe black lives matter is a white excuse me a black supremacist movement
[1:34:25.520 --> 1:34:29.920]  but sometimes they don't i totally agree everybody makes a big deal about the kkk i don't like the kkk
[1:34:29.920 --> 1:34:34.160]  and the kkk had this power was being backed by a major political party i'd really be worried
[1:34:34.160 --> 1:34:40.880]  about them but they don't have any power this is a supremacist group run by george soros a real
[1:34:40.880 --> 1:34:45.600]  nazi collaborator running around trying to create division how do you think it's going for them is
[1:34:45.600 --> 1:34:51.040]  clearly they say they're going to contest the election whether you know whether trump contested
[1:34:51.040 --> 1:34:55.040]  or not they're going to contest if they lose and then if trump fights that they're going to call for
[1:34:55.040 --> 1:35:00.000]  a violent overthrow of the president i mean that's the game plan yeah i think right now the left
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:05.040]  obviously they they they the deep state is gaining ground and you know that alec but i think right
[1:35:05.040 --> 1:35:08.480]  now they don't have the ability to call the military they don't have the ability to call
[1:35:08.480 --> 1:35:13.760]  the marines because they're still patriots in them right now i think they're starting to form a new
[1:35:13.760 --> 1:35:19.680]  shadow military through antifa and blm militants and they do it this way outside of the mainstream
[1:35:19.680 --> 1:35:25.200]  because there's really no uh you know exactly didn't they paralyze the police to say election i'm
[1:35:25.200 --> 1:35:29.680]  trying to rub your debt on it's okay and then they paralyze the police through mayors and police chiefs
[1:35:29.680 --> 1:35:35.520]  they control to incubate their communist militant paramilitary force that obama famously talked about
[1:35:36.400 --> 1:35:42.480]  yep and that's what i saw last night alex last night before you see the uh that little dealership
[1:35:42.480 --> 1:35:47.680]  that was set ablaze by the black lives matter militants the police was dry they were driving
[1:35:47.680 --> 1:35:52.480]  by back and forth they were making threats to hey get away from it get away from it as they
[1:35:52.480 --> 1:35:57.440]  continue to break windows and burn it down and i know the police have their hands tied you see
[1:35:57.440 --> 1:36:02.320]  this in portland as well the commissioner or the mayor tells them you can't use force because if you
[1:36:02.320 --> 1:36:06.240]  do against a minority then you you're all going to be accused of being white nationalist so we
[1:36:06.240 --> 1:36:11.920]  just can't do it we can't do it that that's what happens alex and and honestly alex it's effective
[1:36:11.920 --> 1:36:18.480]  it works but i think this is how the new regime is going to come in black lives matter is a marxist
[1:36:18.480 --> 1:36:24.400]  trojan horse to bring in communism and the new world order and the deep state one world order
[1:36:24.400 --> 1:36:28.800]  in america i truly believe that right now and as you're on fire through rinandez and the footage
[1:36:28.800 --> 1:36:34.080]  you got is literally on fire you got some of the most amazing footage there and we project veritas
[1:36:34.080 --> 1:36:38.400]  predicted that wisconsin would be the big flash point as the election came forward i want your
[1:36:38.400 --> 1:36:43.600]  future predictions where you're going next is all the amazing intel you've got on on where you've
[1:36:43.600 --> 1:36:47.280]  traveled and what you've done and your great success exposing all this reaching now millions of people
[1:36:47.280 --> 1:36:53.200]  it was a sleeper product it wasn't popular at first but as people tried it it's become one
[1:36:53.200 --> 1:36:58.800]  of our top five best sellers i'm talking about the eight pack power stack 13 different pills
[1:36:58.800 --> 1:37:04.000]  filled with super nutrients vitamins minerals and more that you take it's morning and one pack

[1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:20.560]  here's the problem some of the patented ingredients that are in a pack power stack because of the
[1:37:20.560 --> 1:37:26.960]  shutdown and the lockdown are not available for us even reorder it so this could be the last shipment

[1:37:45.680 --> 1:37:55.120]  ever you can really break civilizations down to two types predatory and non-predatory or oppressive
[1:37:55.120 --> 1:38:00.160]  conquest based or renaissance based and of course different types of civilizations and
[1:38:00.880 --> 1:38:07.120]  countries and political systems of history and at the present are mixes of the two but with
[1:38:07.120 --> 1:38:16.480]  globalism it is a post-human ideology so it's scientifically geared to be oppressive and the
[1:38:16.480 --> 1:38:22.160]  rationale is social Darwinism that the ruling class are elites and because they're in power
[1:38:22.160 --> 1:38:28.720]  they have a right to rule over you poison you dumb you down sterilize you and kill you so all
[1:38:28.720 --> 1:38:34.080]  the people wearing masks like outside at the park and stuff are living in a total hoax and think
[1:38:34.080 --> 1:38:40.400]  their act of submission is an act of working for the common good in a collective no it's a sign
[1:38:40.400 --> 1:38:45.200]  that you're a slave who will take the force inoculations federal government yale are studying
[1:38:45.200 --> 1:38:52.640]  the force inoculations right now the new world order is a planetary corporate plan for world
[1:38:52.640 --> 1:39:00.400]  government but world government is only the control grid now intermembers of the cult are told
[1:39:00.400 --> 1:39:05.840]  that they are going to transcend and become gods and attain immortality but the price for that is
[1:39:05.840 --> 1:39:12.800]  to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon based line forms that's why they say carbon
[1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:20.160]  is bad they are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet they are playing god they believe
[1:39:20.160 --> 1:39:26.160]  they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology
[1:39:26.160 --> 1:39:32.000]  to carry out this transformation i know this sounds insane but if you read the writings of the
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:40.400]  globalist it's all on record you have been warned you have been given the information to say no to
[1:39:40.400 --> 1:39:47.840]  this plan this is the end of all life on earth as we know it this is the alien takeover of earth
[1:39:47.840 --> 1:39:51.920]  i'm going to say something right now that is one of the most important things i've ever said so
[1:39:51.920 --> 1:39:58.880]  please listen very very carefully donald trump is not the reason they released covid or had the
[1:39:58.880 --> 1:40:05.920]  lockdown they already had this plan the rockefeller foundation and billa melinda gates it is beyond
[1:40:05.920 --> 1:40:10.560]  critical it is life and death for you and your family to understand about a real animal planet
[1:40:10.560 --> 1:40:18.400]  but this is a worldwide world government takeover on record that it's never going to end the united
[1:40:18.400 --> 1:40:23.600]  nations has admitted that first it's a month then it's six months then they say okay it's two years
[1:40:23.600 --> 1:40:29.840]  they're now saying two years they're now saying you'll never go back to normal no more gatherings
[1:40:29.840 --> 1:40:35.920]  no more anything constant force inoculations that they admit don't even work in the way they say
[1:40:35.920 --> 1:40:42.880]  they work they change your dna this is the culling of the planet this is the beginning of a straight
[1:40:42.880 --> 1:40:49.680]  jacket being put on you before you're slowly tortured to death and killed you understand
[1:40:51.120 --> 1:40:53.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:41:01.520 --> 1:41:09.920]  rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's alex jones trump has fired the
[1:41:09.920 --> 1:41:14.000]  bad signal he said i need you to stop the 80 million fake ballots that are meant to come up
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:18.080]  everything i need you to be vigilant i need your help we're fighting for our very life
[1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:22.800]  we have an outside force trying to destroy our economy and today he said it's the most important
[1:41:22.800 --> 1:41:27.920]  election in us history it's the most important election in world history we are living history
[1:41:27.920 --> 1:41:34.720]  right now every day is like a century the countdown the the the energy in the air you could cut it
[1:41:34.720 --> 1:41:41.280]  with a knife you could not have higher stakes here's the president just an hour ago some really
[1:41:41.280 --> 1:41:47.360]  bad things we have to be very careful because they're trying it again with this whole 80 million
[1:41:47.360 --> 1:41:53.760]  mail-in ballots that they're working on sending them out to people that didn't ask for them they
[1:41:53.760 --> 1:41:59.680]  didn't ask they just get them and it's not fair and it's not right and it's not going to be possible
[1:41:59.680 --> 1:42:05.920]  to tabulate in my opinion it's just my opinion we have to be very very careful and you have to
[1:42:05.920 --> 1:42:11.600]  watch every one of you you have to watch because bad things happened last time with the spying on
[1:42:11.600 --> 1:42:18.160]  our campaign and that goes to biden and that goes to obama and we have to be very very careful
[1:42:18.160 --> 1:42:23.840]  to be very very careful and this time they're trying to do it with the whole post office scam
[1:42:23.840 --> 1:42:28.880]  they'll blame it on the post office you could see him setting it up be very careful and watch it
[1:42:28.880 --> 1:42:34.720]  very carefully because we have to win this is the most important election in the history of our country
[1:42:36.320 --> 1:42:42.080]  ladies and gentlemen there is no doubt that this is history so let me ask a really smart cookie
[1:42:42.080 --> 1:42:45.680]  we've got on i'm impressed with him drew her nanda has got a lot of courage going out there and get
[1:42:45.680 --> 1:42:50.960]  the most amazing a footage in kanosha last night in other areas what do you think we can do you're
[1:42:50.960 --> 1:42:55.680]  out there showing the evil that mainstream media always just says oh peaceful and then won't show
[1:42:55.680 --> 1:43:00.640]  what's happening and you're a soldier in information war going and telling the truth i guess that's
[1:43:00.640 --> 1:43:06.640]  what everybody needs to do what else can we do honestly alex i think that is the number one question
[1:43:06.640 --> 1:43:13.120]  right now because the left the radical hard left is literally resulting to acts of violence and i
[1:43:13.120 --> 1:43:18.320]  think right now we have to have a conversation i mean when the constitution is on the line i know
[1:43:18.320 --> 1:43:23.680]  this is why donald trump is saying this is the most important election in us history not because
[1:43:23.680 --> 1:43:29.440]  he's president uh i think because our constitution is seriously on the line oh you feel it you see
[1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:34.080]  it and you say hardline democrats you're right but they have the absolute backing of the leadership
[1:43:34.080 --> 1:43:39.680]  this is the democratic party this is terrorist yes the and then i know i know donald trump will
[1:43:39.680 --> 1:43:46.000]  always say the only thing standing between your rights uh and and your freedom is me right now
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:51.680]  but i i truly do believe the only thing standing between any of that right now is the constitution
[1:43:51.680 --> 1:43:56.000]  and donald trump is right there in front of it but i think right now we have to be extremely
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:44:00.880]  serious about what's taking place right now alex i mean really think about it with covet going on
[1:44:00.880 --> 1:44:07.200]  right now in my opinion on the streets reporting on the ground there's really not a lot of other
[1:44:07.200 --> 1:44:14.080]  people around no eyewitnesses it's only just these crazy useful idiots because everyone's in their
[1:44:14.080 --> 1:44:20.640]  house there's no witnesses outside everyone's afraid to go outside covet as covet has seriously
[1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:26.800]  put everyone inside their houses so the hard left can call out all their lemmings and do their dirty
[1:44:26.800 --> 1:44:32.160]  work and no one can see it no one can report it because of the scary corona virus and everyone's
[1:44:32.160 --> 1:44:38.720]  it adds up so perfectly alex that's why i go out because i want people to see what these people are
[1:44:38.720 --> 1:44:45.040]  doing and every time alex i'm out there filming i'm an american hispanic alex i get called a white
[1:44:45.040 --> 1:44:51.840]  nationalist i get my life threatened by antifa and blm radicals i i i literally am putting my life
[1:44:51.840 --> 1:44:57.200]  on the line and these people claim to be champions of minorities but they threaten my life every day
[1:44:57.200 --> 1:45:02.640]  why because i have different political opinions no because i'm exposing their criminal activity
[1:45:02.640 --> 1:45:07.520]  and they're mad because their true colors are being shown and they don't want that they're the real
[1:45:07.520 --> 1:45:13.920]  fascist alex fascist suppress the press that's right that's what they do that's who they are
[1:45:13.920 --> 1:45:18.960]  and this is who these people are and we need to continue to unmask them and number one alex
[1:45:18.960 --> 1:45:24.640]  we need to not be afraid of them too many people are afraid of these people who cares of the
[1:45:24.640 --> 1:45:29.600]  consequences america and the constitution is on the line right now and if we continue to put our
[1:45:29.600 --> 1:45:33.920]  heads in the sand even christians born again christians and pastors and people that should
[1:45:33.920 --> 1:45:40.240]  be speaking out if we continue to stand down we will lose everything i agree that's where we are
[1:45:40.240 --> 1:45:45.440]  right now in 2020 alex yeah exactly you have evil multinational cutthroat corporations that own
[1:45:45.440 --> 1:45:50.240]  slave camps in china apple google all of them giving money to black lives matter nothing to do with
[1:45:50.240 --> 1:45:54.320]  black people they want to abort the black people they want to abort everybody they use it as their
[1:45:54.320 --> 1:46:00.240]  front for their communist overthrow it's and dolly parton comes out endorses black lives matter
[1:46:00.240 --> 1:46:05.360]  because to her it's like i'm a girl from tennessee i'm just gonna know you're not endorsing martin
[1:46:05.360 --> 1:46:11.680]  luther king lady who you should endorse you're not endorsing the common sense stuff you're endorsing
[1:46:11.680 --> 1:46:18.400]  the opposite a communist radical overthrow civil unrest god almighty so how do we get all the cowed
[1:46:19.200 --> 1:46:26.080]  white people especially but everybody cowed bowing down to this we need to just start calling people
[1:46:26.080 --> 1:46:31.920]  out where where's the where where are all the hollywood elites alex you saw the footage that's
[1:46:31.920 --> 1:46:38.960]  not cgi it's not fake i didn't make that up in a computer that's what black lives matter does and
[1:46:38.960 --> 1:46:44.000]  then you have lebron james and you have all these uh you know blue check twitter marks all over all
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:49.600]  these hollywood elites they don't condemn it they don't even talk about it why because they're puppets
[1:46:49.600 --> 1:46:55.440]  it's on agenda it's on agenda to get the lemmings to believe that that's actually reality it's not
[1:46:55.440 --> 1:47:00.960]  reality alex and i know you know this alex i'm not yelling at you i don't know you don't wake up to
[1:47:00.960 --> 1:47:04.560]  the reality of what this is we're on over 200 radio stations we have new listeners every second
[1:47:04.560 --> 1:47:09.440]  no they need to know there's an urgency and that's what you get i get it there's an urgency this is
[1:47:09.440 --> 1:47:15.840]  real and it only gets worse if they get reelected if they get into power they want to make us poor
[1:47:15.840 --> 1:47:20.720]  like russia or china or venezuela it's a tool of control explain that to some of the leftists
[1:47:20.720 --> 1:47:26.560]  they're tuning in they think they're gonna get power positions and all this history always repeats
[1:47:26.560 --> 1:47:33.440]  itself anytime a communist regime takes power the useful idiots that got them there are the
[1:47:33.440 --> 1:47:39.840]  first ones to get executed that's how it works why because you have too much influence if you're
[1:47:39.840 --> 1:47:46.240]  a hollywood elite if you're a movie star if you're a a sports star if you have any kind of influence
[1:47:46.240 --> 1:47:52.000]  and you got that regime to the top you're the first to go because you'll be too powerful to remain
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:56.800]  you'll be too influential to remain and you might think you'll have a spot but history
[1:47:56.800 --> 1:48:03.360]  history always repeats itself the first ones to go are the useful idiots and the influential media
[1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:09.520]  figures hollywood elites that got them there because they will find out that they were lied to
[1:48:09.520 --> 1:48:15.360]  and they can't be left alive because if they are they have way too much influence to turn it around
[1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:21.120]  and you can't be left alive that's facts that's communist history and that's where america is
[1:48:21.120 --> 1:48:26.720]  going if we don't stand up and say something and do something alex it's gone too far how far
[1:48:26.720 --> 1:48:33.520]  do we allow this to go how far do we allow this radical left agenda this new world order agenda
[1:48:33.520 --> 1:48:41.120]  subvert erase pervert our children completely decimate our constitution and we just sit back
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:46.320]  and say oh well we we you know we just don't want to be seen as getting a little crazy but alex
[1:48:46.320 --> 1:48:52.320]  what do we do how do you stop a murderous communist regime from taking over and slaughtering america
[1:48:52.320 --> 1:48:57.280]  i think that's the answer that we're all looking for because we've never seen it before alex we've
[1:48:57.280 --> 1:49:01.600]  never seen it we don't have a solution and i think that's what everyone's trying to figure out well
[1:49:01.600 --> 1:49:06.240]  yeah you've seen the clip of carlo sapata he doesn't want violence i don't want violence but he says
[1:49:06.240 --> 1:49:11.920]  you're starving us you're killing us we're going to come after you we're not a million we're 20 40
[1:49:11.920 --> 1:49:16.560]  50 million to get it and we will not be stopped and i don't even want to go there because we're
[1:49:16.560 --> 1:49:20.560]  going to have to chew up all their cannon fodder but i want george soros and the globalist to know
[1:49:20.560 --> 1:49:25.760]  if this really goes to real civil war they're going to be hunted down after we take the country back
[1:49:25.760 --> 1:49:30.160]  no matter where they are they'll be just like the nazis so soros may have gotten out of hungary
[1:49:30.160 --> 1:49:34.560]  or romania back in 1945 working for the nazis but they're not going to get out this time
[1:49:35.600 --> 1:49:40.880]  absolutely not alex i mean let's always remember this why do we have the second amendment is it
[1:49:40.880 --> 1:49:49.120]  for home defense is it for self defense no it's to defend ourselves as americans from a tyrannical
[1:49:49.120 --> 1:49:55.360]  government that's where we're going that's what we're seeing and it's not wrong to cite the second
[1:49:55.360 --> 1:50:00.480]  amendment in that context they're right it's not a threat they're the ones burning everything down
[1:50:00.480 --> 1:50:04.240]  saying they're going to put us in fema camps saying they're gonna arrest us saying they're
[1:50:04.240 --> 1:50:07.760]  gonna kill us they've already censored us what are they they're already telling us we're not
[1:50:07.760 --> 1:50:13.360]  essential i'm they're telling us we're not even human yeah and joe biden is coming out and making
[1:50:13.360 --> 1:50:19.040]  demands you know we're gonna have a nationwide mask mandate we're gonna have nationwide this
[1:50:19.040 --> 1:50:25.520]  nationwide that they think donald trump is the fascist when they are the fascists we all know
[1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:31.760]  that they're masters of doubles speak but it's the leftists it's the kids it's the useful idiots
[1:50:31.760 --> 1:50:36.080]  that need to wait five more minutes with us i want to get you back for a full hour when you

[1:54:10.160 --> 1:54:15.440]  got my heart beating faster earlier because the energy the the fact that he understands
[1:54:15.440 --> 1:54:22.560]  this is imminent this is do or die right now this is hundreds of years of evil building up
[1:54:22.560 --> 1:54:28.080]  to take down the united states in the west this is palpable danger to your body and to your very
[1:54:28.080 --> 1:54:32.560]  will and it just it makes the hair on the back of my next stand up so in the time we have left
[1:54:32.560 --> 1:54:37.200]  we salute your amazing work going into these towns and cities what else do you want to impart to
[1:54:37.200 --> 1:54:43.760]  folks about the fact that this is game time i just want americans to understand that they're
[1:54:43.760 --> 1:54:50.720]  and and and i'm really i'm really saddened that it's gotten so tribal but i want americans to
[1:54:50.720 --> 1:54:56.880]  understand there is no gray area the these people are you're either with us or against us this is
[1:54:56.880 --> 1:55:02.160]  how they act on the streets alex when i'm out there and they find out that i'm there they start
[1:55:02.160 --> 1:55:07.040]  chanting my name they start threatening me they start getting in my face and threatening me pushing
[1:55:07.040 --> 1:55:12.160]  me out of an event because i'm different because i have a different political ideology than them
[1:55:12.160 --> 1:55:18.240]  there there is no accepting or tolerant even though they claim to be tolerant so my message
[1:55:18.240 --> 1:55:23.760]  right now to people that might be you know sitting on the fence just hoping that donald trump will
[1:55:23.760 --> 1:55:29.360]  fix it or just hoping that you know like guys like myself or alex jones or savannah hernan is or
[1:55:29.360 --> 1:55:36.880]  on shroyer will fix it that we can only do so much we can only say so much we can only cover so much
[1:55:36.880 --> 1:55:43.760]  it's the everyday american that has to stand up that has to speak up that has to get up and do
[1:55:43.760 --> 1:55:49.280]  something and say something themselves that's why we have our freedoms that's why men and women
[1:55:49.280 --> 1:55:56.080]  that have gone before us have bled and that have died for this moment alex for this moment
[1:55:56.080 --> 1:56:01.920]  because whenever freedom is on the line sacrifices have to be made and that's where we are in 2020
[1:56:01.920 --> 1:56:07.760]  right now because our lives and our freedom and our constitutional civil rights are being stripped
[1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:13.520]  away from us not only digitally alex but now even in the real world i'm receiving death threats
[1:56:13.520 --> 1:56:18.640]  right now alex i can't go back out and report tonight because antifa is already announcing my
[1:56:18.640 --> 1:56:24.160]  locations because what do you think they want to do alex have a conversation with me ask me why i'm
[1:56:24.160 --> 1:56:29.040]  reporting what i'm reporting no they're going to silence you so that they can work with the media
[1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:34.400]  to control the narrative and claim that the police burned down the buildings absolutely and that's
[1:56:34.400 --> 1:56:41.600]  who these people are this is who's going to gain ground if joe biden gets elected if a globalist
[1:56:41.600 --> 1:56:47.520]  gets back in the white house and takes the congressional all seats senate everything if they
[1:56:47.520 --> 1:56:53.520]  get in full power alex i think the number one thing that they're gonna do is take the constitution
[1:56:53.520 --> 1:56:59.360]  away and they're going to bring in their new world order agenda the new formal is going to be everybody's
[1:56:59.360 --> 1:57:05.120]  new agenda you'll be told what you can do uh you will literally be commanded what you can say what
[1:57:05.120 --> 1:57:10.960]  you can see what you can watch this is where it's going and alex i know you've been talking about this
[1:57:10.960 --> 1:57:16.640]  for years and you're being vindicated right now because everything you've ever told us
[1:57:16.640 --> 1:57:21.920]  about this tyrannical government that's coming to destroy the west is happening right before our
[1:57:21.920 --> 1:57:26.960]  very eye and people need to give you a break because there's a reason why you've been silenced
[1:57:26.960 --> 1:57:31.200]  there's a reason why they don't want you to speak there's a reason alex why this is all
[1:57:31.200 --> 1:57:35.520]  happened to you and it's because of this moment alex it's because of this moment well god bless
[1:57:35.520 --> 1:57:39.680]  you i'd love to give myself credit i just read the most powerful people david rogerfeller and stuff

[2:03:56.160 --> 2:04:03.440]  much happening and so much going on all i ask is you realize how incredibly urgent things are and
[2:04:03.440 --> 2:04:09.840]  that the enemy has launched this whole ai giant takeover for this moment believing they can finally
[2:04:09.840 --> 2:04:19.680]  try to shut down the american people and we knew we had to build our own video sharing system our
[2:04:19.680 --> 2:04:24.240]  own satellite our own radio connection we knew we had to stay on commercial we knew we had to
[2:04:24.240 --> 2:04:28.400]  promote analog we knew we had to get as many people on the email list at info wars dot com
[2:04:28.400 --> 2:04:33.440]  port slash newsletter so that we could move into the future and support and sponsor
[2:04:34.480 --> 2:04:38.560]  hundreds of other organizations and groups with no strings attached just you're doing good work

[2:04:50.400 --> 2:04:54.640]  where i come get your water filtration your air filtration get your storable food that obviously
[2:04:54.640 --> 2:04:58.480]  even if trump wins it's going to get more crazy we've got the highest quality the lowest price
[2:04:58.480 --> 2:05:02.400]  you're going to find i mean there's some stuff five times more that cost to taste gourmet that's
[2:05:02.400 --> 2:05:06.560]  taste better but it tastes really good it's nutritious high quality some of the stuff you know
[2:05:06.560 --> 2:05:10.320]  people go out this tastes like it is gourmet and some of it tastes okay but it's high quality
[2:05:10.320 --> 2:05:17.440]  food great packaging great storage last 25 years get your orders in now while you still can because
[2:05:17.440 --> 2:05:21.520]  you saw everybody panic with eight week shipping for us everybody else was sold out and lying to you
[2:05:22.080 --> 2:05:26.720]  everybody got their stuff a few weeks early that's when they got scared of the virus i said don't
[2:05:26.720 --> 2:05:30.720]  get scared of the virus get scared of the lockdown of the economy and the depression that's going to
[2:05:30.720 --> 2:05:39.680]  come so i hope Trump can turn it around i'd say 60 chance he wins even with fraud but 30 chance he
[2:05:39.680 --> 2:05:43.760]  can turn this depression around there's keeping things on live support right now he knows we're
[2:05:43.760 --> 2:05:49.760]  under artificial fire and attack so they are using inflation to prop it up but i it's it's it's it's
[2:05:49.760 --> 2:05:54.720]  the only move he's got i don't blame him for it but this is such a critical time to be alive
[2:05:54.720 --> 2:06:01.440]  it's so insane so savannah hernandez greg reese i'm glad you guys decided to go out to portland
[2:06:02.400 --> 2:06:05.840]  you were going to go to chicago first you decided to go to portland last minute you went there
[2:06:05.840 --> 2:06:10.800]  there's hours of footage band on video it's all over in full wars of the street clashes of antifa
[2:06:10.800 --> 2:06:17.840]  attacking the police standing down how would you describe it savannah hernandez it was like a civil
[2:06:17.840 --> 2:06:22.240]  war out there and you know alex you always use the word deranged when you're talking about these
[2:06:22.240 --> 2:06:25.520]  leftists and i was talking to greg about this when we were there you always say that they're
[2:06:25.520 --> 2:06:30.000]  deranged they're demonic they're foamy at the mouth and i always thought it was a bit dramatic
[2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:38.640]  but going to portland was exactly that the people there are demonic they're evil they're angry
[2:06:38.640 --> 2:06:45.200]  they're deranged i've never seen anything like it and i don't want to go back the the violence we
[2:06:45.200 --> 2:06:50.880]  saw from antifa as they marched through neighborhoods as they approached the police as they approached
[2:06:50.880 --> 2:06:55.200]  the patriots who were in front of the justice center this past saturday something that's been
[2:06:55.200 --> 2:07:01.440]  happening for the past over 80 days now and no one has put a stop to it it was shocking to see
[2:07:02.160 --> 2:07:06.960]  but not surprising in the least and my biggest takeaway from this because a lot of people are
[2:07:06.960 --> 2:07:12.000]  wondering well why is antifa allowed to do this for so long why have we let this go on for so long
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:15.840]  especially in these neighborhoods is to encourage others to do it exactly and a lot what a lot of
[2:07:15.840 --> 2:07:19.920]  people don't know is that the people in those neighborhoods are actually encouraging the marchers
[2:07:19.920 --> 2:07:23.040]  they're standing on their balconies and their porches and they're clapping they're saying you're
[2:07:23.040 --> 2:07:27.440]  here you're you're doing a great job thank you for everything that you do and that's what made me
[2:07:27.440 --> 2:07:30.800]  realize that they've been allowed to do this for so long that's blue city's attack on the rest of
[2:07:30.800 --> 2:07:36.400]  country exactly exactly that's exactly what this is the people in portland have allowed this to
[2:07:36.400 --> 2:07:40.720]  fester and turn into this huge mess and they're now trying to branch out off into the rest of
[2:07:40.720 --> 2:07:45.440]  america they're planning on going to kentucky we've seen them in charlotte they were in wisconsin
[2:07:45.440 --> 2:07:49.200]  and they're going to continue to branch out the closer we get to the election and people ask how i
[2:07:49.200 --> 2:07:53.440]  knew this 10 years ago the universities were saying we're getting rid of free speech we're
[2:07:53.440 --> 2:07:56.800]  going to turn everybody racially against each other then we're going to explode and take over the
[2:07:56.800 --> 2:08:00.880]  rest of country and you're like oh they won't do it these big corporations didn't put tens of
[2:08:00.880 --> 2:08:06.480]  millions of dollars into this for no reason this is their plan gregory's absolutely the other thing
[2:08:06.480 --> 2:08:11.600]  that became evident is their main strategy they're basically puppets for the mainstream media and
[2:08:11.600 --> 2:08:17.200]  very few of them are aware of that i would say the majority of them is like this mentally ill army
[2:08:17.200 --> 2:08:22.320]  that they've recruited of just angry individuals from all walks of life but then there are the ones
[2:08:22.320 --> 2:08:26.320]  up front that are instigating they're they're you know we got them on video clearly trying to
[2:08:26.960 --> 2:08:32.080]  that's okay you've got the mentally ill mass but you've got this the these the psychological experts
[2:08:32.080 --> 2:08:38.480]  that are controlling exactly and then they also have a team of of press of black block press all
[2:08:38.480 --> 2:08:44.000]  over the place trying to get trying they're looking to capture this the optics of you know the patriots
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:48.640]  being the violent ones and antifa not being the violent ones and so it's clear that some of them
[2:08:48.640 --> 2:08:52.640]  know kind of know what's going on and then savannah caught some of them in a parking garage where they
[2:08:52.640 --> 2:08:57.040]  were getting overtly violent and that was the first time that they expressed any concern for
[2:08:57.040 --> 2:09:01.920]  her filming it they didn't want that on on video and that clearly showed them stalking down like a
[2:09:01.920 --> 2:09:07.200]  group of three people or something like that yeah so yeah they're bullies come exactly and it's so
[2:09:07.200 --> 2:09:11.440]  well organized alex the media keeps trying to tell us that antifa is not a well organized
[2:09:11.440 --> 2:09:16.720]  militia that antifa is fake what me and greg went and witnessed they have vehicle convoys they have
[2:09:16.720 --> 2:09:20.960]  people on moped they have their own press they're very well organized they know exactly what they're
[2:09:20.960 --> 2:09:24.640]  doing and they're coming to your neighborhood because this is the democrats plan to take over
[2:09:24.640 --> 2:09:29.440]  the election to take over america every single day we see a new city being burned down and you
[2:09:29.440 --> 2:09:35.040]  imagine once these commies are in control i mean i mean literally this will be who will be ruling

[2:12:45.600 --> 2:12:49.840]  guys are amazing we love you i want to go to call the next segment but savannah anand as
[2:12:49.840 --> 2:12:54.320]  greg rishartman greg why'd you guys pick to go there you said it's going to be the worst ever
[2:12:54.320 --> 2:12:58.240]  how'd you know that how would you describe it the media spotted a bunch of different ways
[2:12:58.240 --> 2:13:02.720]  what really happened they say biggest street battles ever since like world war one we were
[2:13:02.720 --> 2:13:07.200]  having street battles or something in the u.s i mean what the hell was going on here you know
[2:13:07.200 --> 2:13:11.600]  honestly i gotta give credit to the spirit this you know for guiding us because savannah's been
[2:13:11.600 --> 2:13:16.320]  bugging me forever about going somewhere and getting into the heat uh mostly she was talking
[2:13:16.320 --> 2:13:20.320]  about portland but then just recently she was talking about chicago and i just asked her why
[2:13:20.320 --> 2:13:24.800]  not portland and then we just asked uh our news director rob do if we knew anything about
[2:13:26.320 --> 2:13:31.200]  perhaps the proud boys going to portland or anywhere and then he uh inquired and right away
[2:13:31.200 --> 2:13:35.200]  got a reply that they were going to portland which was the first we heard of it so we immediately
[2:13:35.200 --> 2:13:39.680]  picked portland and the whole and then the rest of the trip was very synchronistic it reminded
[2:13:39.680 --> 2:13:45.760]  us of a bit of hong kong when we went to hong kong but yeah we um happened upon in my it seems to
[2:13:45.760 --> 2:13:49.520]  me this is the first time these people have been challenged in portland for the 80 days they've
[2:13:49.520 --> 2:13:54.640]  been protesting and i was actually hoping for a better outcome but to be honest uh they could
[2:13:54.640 --> 2:14:00.160]  claim the victory because they their numbers seem to grow throughout the two hours we were there
[2:14:00.160 --> 2:14:06.800]  and eventually they drove the that crowd out of there cheering victory cornering them in the
[2:14:06.800 --> 2:14:11.200]  parking lot and to hear them saying down with america again if it's so bad get the hell out
[2:14:11.200 --> 2:14:16.160]  though they don't want to they want to conquer it and then ruin the the the the the the economy and
[2:14:16.160 --> 2:14:21.040]  take it over they were also there burning american flags to alex and they had guillotines for them
[2:14:21.040 --> 2:14:24.800]  yeah they did and you know i'm glad that you brought up too how the mainstream media has been
[2:14:24.800 --> 2:14:29.520]  trying to cover this event at the justice center because of course we're going to see that it was
[2:14:29.520 --> 2:14:34.480]  right wing extremist that it was the proud boys who are nazis and this white supremacist group
[2:14:34.480 --> 2:14:38.640]  who were attacking these poor antifa types but what i want people to notice too because there's
[2:14:38.640 --> 2:14:43.680]  a guy there's a reporter for vice right now i guess one of the proud boys came and broke his fingers
[2:14:43.680 --> 2:14:48.000]  with a baton first off he was in the heat of the battle i was standing right there i got that exact
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:52.320]  same shot yeah they throw themselves the middle of a battle and then and then selectively go on
[2:14:52.320 --> 2:14:57.040]  a victim exactly but i want to point something out so antifa has this very well figured out
[2:14:57.040 --> 2:15:01.040]  they have antifa press a lot of the people in those videos that have press helmets and
[2:15:01.040 --> 2:15:05.760]  press vests are not pressed they're within tifa and i watched them a lot of them call themselves
[2:15:05.760 --> 2:15:10.720]  medics no they're they're medics and they are press alex they have separate different groups
[2:15:10.720 --> 2:15:16.160]  yeah okay so they have a bunch of different people and the press they actually instigate a lot of
[2:15:16.160 --> 2:15:20.400]  violence and then they'll they'll like set up a scene they'll instigate the violence and then
[2:15:20.400 --> 2:15:27.280]  they'll take a video of the proud boys being violent extremists against uh you know innocent antifa
[2:15:27.280 --> 2:15:32.320]  types oh yeah i had that facebook funding group come up like last year when we were in dc and these
[2:15:32.320 --> 2:15:36.640]  women go f u white person all this stuff and i didn't say anything back racist but they edited
[2:15:36.640 --> 2:15:40.960]  that i attacked Native American women right exactly and that's what they're doing they figured all of
[2:15:40.960 --> 2:15:46.800]  this out and it's just this very well constructed well organized group up there so to say that the
[2:15:46.800 --> 2:15:51.440]  the fact that we have democrats in office again still completely refusing to acknowledge that
[2:15:51.440 --> 2:15:57.520]  antifa is a domestic terrorist organization in america is ridiculous i want one of the nadler
[2:15:57.520 --> 2:16:01.920]  says it doesn't it's a myth yeah exactly i would love jerry okay jerry nadler let's go to portland
[2:16:01.920 --> 2:16:05.840]  you and me let's go to portland let's walk the streets together because i was out there and i
[2:16:05.840 --> 2:16:11.520]  got bare maced shot with paintballs eggs were thrown silly string show me that you got a paintball
[2:16:11.520 --> 2:16:17.360]  scar i got a little paintball uh hit and um you know this was a very real thing that was happening
[2:16:17.360 --> 2:16:22.240]  and residents in portland too because greg and i had an uber driver and she was basically telling us
[2:16:22.880 --> 2:16:26.720]  you know a lot of the people in portland don't agree with this but i think they're really scared
[2:16:26.720 --> 2:16:30.880]  to speak up because the majority do and those that don't if you speak up you're going to get
[2:16:30.880 --> 2:16:34.160]  attacked your house is going to get burned down your family is going to get so let me ask you
[2:16:34.160 --> 2:16:39.680]  this and then greg obviously they're going to say that the election's stolen they're going to contest
[2:16:39.680 --> 2:16:45.200]  when trump tries to contest the contention they are going to trigger what they call a race war
[2:16:45.200 --> 2:16:50.160]  but it's really leftist activists all this is just beta testing to get ready you see it all
[2:16:50.160 --> 2:16:54.800]  escalating it's not even speculation out they admit it's the plan what do we do greg with
[2:16:54.800 --> 2:16:59.120]  70 days out to get ahead of this and expose it trump called for our help today he said most
[2:16:59.120 --> 2:17:03.680]  important election ever i agree well there's never been a more important time in the information
[2:17:03.680 --> 2:17:09.600]  war i mean the army of of angry psychotic mentally ill people that they have and that is the majority
[2:17:09.600 --> 2:17:14.080]  of them are just people that are mentally ill none of this would have been possible without the
[2:17:14.080 --> 2:17:18.000]  mainstream media because these people are just out there repeating the talking points because they've
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:21.520]  put all their faith in their favorite celebrities or their mentally ill people that have been told
[2:17:21.520 --> 2:17:25.440]  go crazy you're a hero absolutely and and they're convinced of it and you can see it and the only
[2:17:25.440 --> 2:17:29.520]  thing that's going to change them is inform is changing that information changing the because
[2:17:29.520 --> 2:17:34.960]  right now the trendy thing to do and they're getting support from all of pop culture in america
[2:17:34.960 --> 2:17:40.080]  is to go out there and burn things down and to just say every white man is a racist and america's
[2:17:40.080 --> 2:17:45.280]  horrible and destroy it all one of the craziest things i saw there was uh someone spray painted
[2:17:45.840 --> 2:17:51.760]  basically something like may the things that we burn down someday be built back with love no
[2:17:51.760 --> 2:17:56.640]  like the way for the future make a way for the future but basically it was an admission that
[2:17:56.640 --> 2:18:01.600]  they have no plan whatsoever for what's coming next oh it's like it's like double thing so people
[2:18:01.600 --> 2:18:05.920]  are robbing stores they go i can't breathe i can't like when a guy steals a little white
[2:18:05.920 --> 2:18:11.280]  kid's bike he goes you're a racist you're floyd it's like an excuse to be evil exactly elix and
[2:18:11.280 --> 2:18:15.200]  so many people have talked about how black lives matter is a trojan horse to bring communism into
[2:18:15.200 --> 2:18:19.280]  america and that's exactly what it is because if you go out in the street right now and say
[2:18:19.280 --> 2:18:24.000]  black lives matter is a terrorist organization or they're domestic terrorists you're immediately
[2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:29.840]  labeled a racist and you're immediately discredited by the media and the left by the mob that is
[2:18:29.840 --> 2:18:35.280]  ruling so how do you think it's going for soros of the democrats because i mean it's obama and then
[2:18:35.280 --> 2:18:39.440]  their body languages they're scared and trump's coming out calling them out as criminals there's
[2:18:39.440 --> 2:18:43.600]  some indictments have happened i mean i don't want to be over optimistic i don't want to be you know
[2:18:43.600 --> 2:18:47.120]  over negative either but what how do you guys think it is i feel optimistic i mean we're out
[2:18:47.120 --> 2:18:52.720]  there and basically what we're witnessing is this is like uh lala palusa in a dark like it's it's
[2:18:52.720 --> 2:18:57.280]  sadham and gemora lala please i mean it's just a drug it's a blue city throwing a fit on itself
[2:18:57.280 --> 2:19:03.360]  absolutely that's all it's a desperate insanely desperate attempt to get get out of a mess that
[2:19:03.360 --> 2:19:07.200]  they're never gonna get out of that's the impression i got out of and so what that tells me is for the
[2:19:07.200 --> 2:19:10.720]  next several weeks we're just gonna see more of this and more of this and more of this because
[2:19:10.720 --> 2:19:15.280]  this is all they that's my next question it's escalating what comes next yeah we made a good
[2:19:15.280 --> 2:19:19.360]  point too greg and i were talking about this that donald trump basically is allowing this to
[2:19:19.360 --> 2:19:24.880]  happen in these cities because he's forcing people to say okay we need police we need your help we
[2:19:24.880 --> 2:19:28.000]  need law and order the only thing that's gonna change you make the perfect choice he didn't
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:32.960]  just do that he tried to go in first they called him racist so he pulled back he because usually
[2:19:32.960 --> 2:19:38.480]  you he knows it's an adjuvant they're trying to catch him in some violence so he yeah and this is
[2:19:38.480 --> 2:19:43.360]  also why i think they sold him as a dictator from day one was because they knew that if he did come
[2:19:43.360 --> 2:19:47.920]  in and make some moves maybe too soon then he would look to the average person like a dick well
[2:19:47.920 --> 2:19:51.680]  yeah i watch these cops in wisconsin people walk up and aim guns at him i'm sorry i'm not looking
[2:19:51.680 --> 2:19:55.840]  to kill anybody you're not blocking my car i mean they got to me no i'm really impressed by the
[2:19:55.840 --> 2:20:00.320]  police restrainer the police have their hands so tied in portland i watched them give 10 warnings
[2:20:00.320 --> 2:20:04.800]  to antifa the first night we got there they still went they destroyed three police cars they broke
[2:20:04.800 --> 2:20:09.840]  windows they threw glass the police could not do anything because again democratic leadership the
[2:20:09.840 --> 2:20:15.200]  police were they had their hands tied so if this is how you want america to be please vote for joe
[2:20:15.200 --> 2:20:18.400]  biden you're not going to be safe on the street you're not going to be safe in your own home and
[2:20:18.400 --> 2:20:22.080]  you're just like that army sergeant they tried to pull out of his car the guy got killed exactly
[2:20:22.080 --> 2:20:25.600]  they're going to run to reality mm-hmm let's talk about that when we come back and write the phone
[2:20:25.600 --> 2:20:29.280]  calls i'll ask the listeners that too well whatever topic you're calling in about you can bring up
[2:20:29.280 --> 2:20:33.120]  i love the wildcard nature of but also what's your line of the sand we're not looking for violence
[2:20:33.120 --> 2:20:37.600]  but we're not going to bend over to take it forever and listen the best defense is a good
[2:20:37.600 --> 2:20:44.480]  offense once we go on defense that means offense the social engineers bet on you not having a memory
[2:20:44.480 --> 2:20:48.880]  more than anything and they also bet is they constantly talk about it in their own words
[2:20:48.880 --> 2:20:54.640]  that you will adapt to being a slave that you will learn incrementally to submit so think about
[2:20:54.640 --> 2:21:00.480]  and remember the phases of the Fauci fraud remember that everything he said has been a premeditated
[2:21:00.480 --> 2:21:06.320]  lie they lied about where it came from they lied about person to person the un covered it all up
[2:21:06.320 --> 2:21:14.720]  then exaggerated the death rate at 4% but it's actually 0.032 now and dropping then they set
[2:21:14.720 --> 2:21:19.360]  the test up to count almost all false positives they put the names of people that died of other
[2:21:19.360 --> 2:21:24.720]  diseases in the covid column they only said there'd be a 15 day lockdown now we're six months later
[2:21:24.720 --> 2:21:29.280]  now they say it's permanent you got to wear masks forever and forced inoculations are coming and
[2:21:29.280 --> 2:21:33.360]  they're going to track everywhere you go and what you do the global social credit score and the un is
[2:21:33.360 --> 2:21:38.240]  the boss anybody questioning it is censored off the internet loses their job that's called 24
[2:21:38.240 --> 2:21:43.680]  century tyranny that's called world government takeover incrementalism the inchworm effect
[2:21:44.240 --> 2:21:50.480]  successive approximation first they tell you only stay in your house for 15 days so the hospitals
[2:21:50.480 --> 2:21:55.760]  can stay empty that was all a fraud then wear a mask for a month here we are six months later
[2:21:56.400 --> 2:22:02.480]  then they start making people at colleges and at big corporations where wristbands showing that
[2:22:02.480 --> 2:22:08.800]  they've been quote contact traced and tested for covid then comes the apps on your phones and the
[2:22:08.800 --> 2:22:14.480]  global social credit score now being rolled out by virginia california and others it's not coming
[2:22:14.480 --> 2:22:19.760]  it's here and then the inoculations if you ever want to leave your house which amounts to forced
[2:22:19.760 --> 2:22:25.600]  inoculations this is the medical tyranny takeover these are not classic vaccines that have their
[2:22:25.600 --> 2:22:32.640]  own problems these are dna vaccines that change your dna and are having massive serious side effects
[2:22:32.640 --> 2:22:39.200]  guaranteed this is about depopulation bill gates admits that this is an emergency resist or die
[2:22:39.200 --> 2:22:44.800]  the new world order is here attention attention attention to anyone that still wants to live
[2:22:44.800 --> 2:22:50.640]  in a free country the new world order chai kong globalist syndicate is making its move to implode
[2:22:50.640 --> 2:22:56.320]  the dollar and thrust the united states into a civil war by contesting the election they are
[2:22:56.320 --> 2:23:00.880]  openly working in this at the highest levels of democratic party nancy polosi and others have
[2:23:00.880 --> 2:23:06.800]  gone on television and said they will contest the election trump is going they will hold a separate
[2:23:06.800 --> 2:23:12.080]  inauguration for biden and kamala harris and that anyone challenging that will be called a racist
[2:23:12.080 --> 2:23:17.040]  they will then trigger race riots and violence they've already beta tested around the country
[2:23:17.040 --> 2:23:23.200]  we are not living in normal times when these type of things happen history people are usually caught
[2:23:23.200 --> 2:23:29.520]  flatfooted because they can't believe they're living in such a criminal era we are we are living in
[2:23:29.520 --> 2:23:34.000]  the period where this criminal globalist syndicate that's been feeding on america is being exposed
[2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:38.880]  and removed now is the time for all good men and women to come to their aid of the country spread
[2:23:38.880 --> 2:23:46.480]  the word now paul reviers you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:23:57.600 --> 2:24:04.560]  election countdown 2020 taking back america he aligns himself with the truth
[2:24:04.560 --> 2:24:11.840]  and it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to alex jones well you live to see it
[2:24:11.840 --> 2:24:16.800]  the combined forces of the chicoms the eu the hollywood scum the blue states the blue cities
[2:24:17.840 --> 2:24:24.160]  the eu world government throwing everything it's got america and you notice god has a sense of humor
[2:24:24.160 --> 2:24:28.960]  though and threw up donald trump as a standard against the enemy what's up to us to heed that
[2:24:28.960 --> 2:24:33.520]  and trump's been firing the bat signal i may not be here much longer i've cut off these one-sided
[2:24:33.520 --> 2:24:37.680]  deals i'm doing fair deals with people i want to be friendlier by but we're not taking it anymore
[2:24:37.680 --> 2:24:42.240]  in the caster and now he came out today and he said they're engaged in massive fraud they're
[2:24:42.240 --> 2:24:47.760]  coming after this biggest election in our history i need you to watch out america i need you he says
[2:24:47.760 --> 2:24:52.640]  you've got the power it's what he just had to say some really bad things we have to be very
[2:24:52.640 --> 2:24:59.200]  careful because they're trying it again with this whole 80 million mail-in ballots that they're working
[2:24:59.200 --> 2:25:05.040]  on sending them out to people that didn't ask for them they didn't ask they just get them
[2:25:05.920 --> 2:25:10.720]  and it's not fair and it's not right and it's not going to be possible to tabulate
[2:25:10.720 --> 2:25:16.560]  in my opinion it's just my opinion we have to be very very careful and you have to watch every
[2:25:16.560 --> 2:25:22.320]  one of you you have to watch because bad things happened last time with the spying on our campaign
[2:25:22.320 --> 2:25:29.040]  and that goes to biden and that goes to obama and we have to be very very careful to be very very
[2:25:29.040 --> 2:25:34.320]  careful and this time they're trying to do it with the whole post office scam they'll blame
[2:25:34.320 --> 2:25:40.080]  it on the post office you could see him setting it up be very careful and watch it very carefully
[2:25:40.080 --> 2:25:46.160]  because we have to win this is the most important election in the history of our country and that's
[2:25:46.160 --> 2:25:50.640]  not hype everybody knows it's true until they tell you he's a liar all day i want to go to phone
[2:25:50.640 --> 2:25:54.560]  calls we'll go into the next hour and then jeryl salent he'll take over the last 45 minutes but
[2:25:54.560 --> 2:25:58.320]  i'm going to go to every person that's holding we're very thankful for everybody holding whether
[2:25:58.320 --> 2:26:01.920]  it's douglas or whether it's christian we're going to get to everybody uh but just a brief comment
[2:26:01.920 --> 2:26:07.200]  on that historic situation savannah hernan is to see the president talking like that he's completely
[2:26:07.200 --> 2:26:11.280]  right this is a very important election probably the most important election in our history the
[2:26:11.280 --> 2:26:15.760]  american people have gotten comfortable because donald trump has been in office but they need to
[2:26:15.760 --> 2:26:20.640]  realize that they are the last line of defense basically we need to keep that president donald
[2:26:20.640 --> 2:26:26.240]  trump in office and we need a fight for our country because what we see in portland what we see
[2:26:26.240 --> 2:26:31.520]  in california is going to spread across america if we continue to allow democrats to take control
[2:26:31.520 --> 2:26:37.280]  and it's the whole world government ganged up on us right now and again big tech runs death camps
[2:26:37.280 --> 2:26:43.680]  in china that's who they are it's sick greg race yeah i you know i think the more that the more
[2:26:43.680 --> 2:26:48.000]  the volume turns up on all this the better and you know trump needs our support if we're going to
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:51.680]  bring back law and order then we have to do it in a way that's judiciously and we have to do it
[2:26:51.680 --> 2:26:56.880]  through law and order and i think that requires the the voice of the people to demand it and the
[2:26:56.880 --> 2:27:01.840]  only way the average person is going to demand it is if the uh the heat's turned up because a lot of
[2:27:01.840 --> 2:27:06.400]  people have just become so desensitized they just assume that you know corruption is part of politics
[2:27:06.400 --> 2:27:11.920]  and everything but the more they can see how crazy and destructive this thing actually is the more
[2:27:11.920 --> 2:27:15.520]  they will demand that the president follows through and takes care you're right this isn't the old
[2:27:15.520 --> 2:27:20.400]  cycles of rotting america and corrupt groups just fighting over money this is the takedown of the
[2:27:20.400 --> 2:27:25.520]  country this is absolutely this is not normal bs there's no getting out of this there's an article
[2:27:25.520 --> 2:27:30.080]  out i saw something about how get ready for their for the the new excuse of saying well
[2:27:30.080 --> 2:27:34.240]  we had no idea that that was happening or something talking about how everyone on the left
[2:27:34.240 --> 2:27:38.240]  can back out of this by saying they didn't know and the only problem i have with that article is
[2:27:38.240 --> 2:27:42.560]  there's no backing out of this at this point i mean it's gone way oh what if they if they win it's
[2:27:42.560 --> 2:27:48.000]  hell on earth i mean i saw a bunch of articles going what happens if we take it from trump
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:52.640]  there's going to be a big backlash yeah called real war absolutely i mean you know you guys
[2:27:52.640 --> 2:27:57.280]  feel this you're you're done absolutely yeah what we're seeing now is just a precursor to
[2:27:57.280 --> 2:28:03.200]  what's going to happen alex and i mean i really do hope that people wake up and again i mean myself
[2:28:03.200 --> 2:28:07.040]  included you know i've been watching politics and following politics for the past two years and once
[2:28:07.040 --> 2:28:11.200]  you see all of this stuff start to connect and realize that what we're seeing in portland what
[2:28:11.200 --> 2:28:14.800]  you're seeing on twitter right now is very real and it will be at your front door if you don't
[2:28:14.800 --> 2:28:19.760]  stand up and fight back we have people actively burning out american flags like and nobody standing
[2:28:19.760 --> 2:28:24.640]  up against this this is just common now on the streets of our own country and who do they work
[2:28:24.640 --> 2:28:29.680]  for a foreign power well they tell us we work for the russians all right who's been holding the longest
[2:28:29.680 --> 2:28:34.400]  here i'm gonna go right to your phone calls now i really appreciate everybody holding uh let's go
[2:28:34.400 --> 2:28:44.400]  ahead and talk to douglas in ohio douglas go ahead yeah alex good day to you guys hey i just want
[2:28:44.400 --> 2:28:50.560]  emergency message to get out to trump first of all to uh i think one of the major things he needs to
[2:28:50.560 --> 2:28:59.680]  do is go open for it not show us the gold show america their gold for help us please and then
[2:28:59.680 --> 2:29:06.400]  what about all the billions of rounds of ammo and ak-47 still sitting in warehouses ready to feed
[2:29:06.400 --> 2:29:11.360]  antifa when they're ready to deliver they have caught that's even the only times the chinese
[2:29:11.360 --> 2:29:15.760]  government shipping and ak-47s and all this ammo it's it's crazy they're actually trying it they just
[2:29:15.760 --> 2:29:20.160]  can't find any slobs they're actually willing to carry it out that's kind of the good news but yeah
[2:29:20.160 --> 2:29:24.480]  trumps tried to declassify a lot of documents he's trying to release the alien stuff the bureaucracy
[2:29:24.480 --> 2:29:30.480]  will not release it so it's like if i told somebody across the you know the hall in the in the finance
[2:29:30.480 --> 2:29:35.440]  department hey write somebody a bonus if they decided not to do it it'd be a big problem for me so
[2:29:35.440 --> 2:29:39.920]  people want trump to do all this stuff uh i mean he's only one man but i hear you and i appreciate
[2:29:39.920 --> 2:29:46.400]  your call sir who's up next here let's go to christian in wisconsin christian go ahead
[2:29:48.160 --> 2:29:53.760]  yeah alex thank you for taking my call i actually was on scene in kenosha shortly after jacob lake
[2:29:53.760 --> 2:29:59.120]  uh was shot and i took the viral video of the officer getting hit in the head with a brick
[2:29:59.120 --> 2:30:02.480]  okay we'll stop there hey guys cue up the video the officer being hit in the head by the brick
[2:30:02.480 --> 2:30:07.760]  thank you for getting in thank you for holding tell us what you saw in kenosha well um yeah
[2:30:07.760 --> 2:30:13.360]  kenosha is uh crazy um everyone's a lot more violent i was also in minneapolis and i'm seeing a
[2:30:13.360 --> 2:30:19.600]  lot more angst towards uh racial division um and i believe what you're describing on your show
[2:30:19.600 --> 2:30:24.720]  is a future being pushed for fully automated luxury communism and they're using anarchal
[2:30:24.720 --> 2:30:30.000]  communism as a social engineering tool to accomplish this future um you know obviously
[2:30:30.000 --> 2:30:34.080]  we've talked about or you've talked about robots doing everything while you sit at home in your
[2:30:34.080 --> 2:30:39.440]  live prison and this is all just one way to push us into that unit to the 21 voluntary home but
[2:30:39.440 --> 2:30:43.520]  yeah i totally agree so what happened to the police officer what was happening at the scene
[2:30:43.520 --> 2:30:47.760]  alone cops got a lot of courage pulls up the middle of a horn of a hundred crazed people burning
[2:30:47.760 --> 2:30:52.880]  buildings so he wasn't a coward just hit gets hit full power in the head with a brick uh and then
[2:30:52.880 --> 2:30:59.440]  tell us how he's doing um for my understanding i have not heard anything in the officer on how he
[2:30:59.440 --> 2:31:05.600]  is doing but i know he was not killed because that was not portrayed by the media at least not yet
[2:31:05.600 --> 2:31:10.880]  but uh basically from what i saw because i was right there is that the police officer was trying
[2:31:10.880 --> 2:31:17.280]  to break up a uh you know a kind of a fight and another police officer was trying to get the vehicle
[2:31:17.280 --> 2:31:21.280]  out because they were just trying to diffuse the situation and i think leave because they
[2:31:21.280 --> 2:31:26.000]  realized that they were causing more problems at the time than uh what was going on because
[2:31:26.000 --> 2:31:29.600]  where people are congregating and i don't know i mean i gotta be honest with you if i was a cop
[2:31:29.600 --> 2:31:33.360]  down these cities i'm not gonna pull in the middle of a hundred people that hate me i mean i'm gonna
[2:31:33.360 --> 2:31:37.040]  just go home with my gun or they come to my house i'm gonna defend myself i mean at a certain point
[2:31:37.040 --> 2:31:41.520]  my god this is out of control i mean you pull up around a hundred plus people want to kill you
[2:31:41.520 --> 2:31:45.600]  and then they hit you in the head with that with with a brick see that looks in two sorry
[2:31:45.600 --> 2:31:49.600]  Greg go ahead go ahead i was just gonna say their strategy depends on taking advantage of the good
[2:31:49.600 --> 2:31:53.440]  nature of people because you could see in that video the last thing that guy was expecting
[2:31:53.440 --> 2:31:56.160]  when someone was gonna actually throw a brick at his head i mean it's just not what we're used to
[2:31:56.160 --> 2:32:01.200]  in this country and there that's their main one of their main tactics is uh stooping as low as they
[2:32:01.200 --> 2:32:04.800]  can and again i'm sorry but look at these other cops will they do nothing about whoever did it
[2:32:05.600 --> 2:32:10.560]  and i was just going to add too that we've been so focused on the defund or abolish the police
[2:32:10.560 --> 2:32:15.680]  movement but the police already have their hands tied the police already aren't even enacting well
[2:32:15.680 --> 2:32:20.880]  let's say they've already he massacred the police they've already amassed the police it's already
[2:32:20.880 --> 2:32:25.120]  done all they did in portland was player recording over and over again that's all no repercussion
[2:32:25.120 --> 2:32:30.640]  and i want people did get arrested they were immediately released there was the aclu legal
[2:32:30.640 --> 2:32:35.120]  observers there oh by the way all the aclu does is support the destruction of freedom they were
[2:32:35.120 --> 2:32:40.720]  walking with they worked with soros they got bought off by the aclu as a criminal organization i watched
[2:32:40.720 --> 2:32:45.840]  them walk with antifa and watch them and see who got arrested so they could help bail them out
[2:32:45.840 --> 2:32:50.400]  there's also the national lawyers field who was writing numbers on tifa yeah they were writing
[2:32:50.400 --> 2:32:55.360]  their number on antifa members arms so they could call them if they got arrested and immediately get
[2:32:55.360 --> 2:32:59.680]  let out and that's what's happening because the power structure is behind them yeah and this
[2:32:59.680 --> 2:33:04.240]  completely emboldens them and so they you could sense that they feel victor they feel like they're
[2:33:04.240 --> 2:33:08.400]  running that place and they're winning the revolution they think they're winning all the money and all
[2:33:08.400 --> 2:33:12.960]  the power and all the chai comes and all the hollywood and all the blue states and all the blue
[2:33:12.960 --> 2:33:17.760]  city and all of it because they're the rebels everyone's all the powers up no you're not the

[2:38:42.560 --> 2:38:48.160]  georgia now but yeah it's just in me hillbillies are fighters you know we know it so uh i wanted to
[2:38:48.160 --> 2:38:54.080]  basically call and see if you could put the documents that you use like lockstep virginia 21
[2:38:54.800 --> 2:39:01.200]  on a link on your website so that we could print them up and give them to our libtard friends
[2:39:01.200 --> 2:39:04.080]  because they're like well where's the evidence where's he's getting this from where's he getting
[2:39:04.080 --> 2:39:09.360]  that from if you just type in lockstep i think the top link goes right to the rockefeller.org
[2:39:09.360 --> 2:39:13.520]  website so we can print them in so we can do it right from the website okay cool that's good
[2:39:13.520 --> 2:39:19.680]  and also have you ever thought about putting um a chat or some kind of way that we could organize
[2:39:19.680 --> 2:39:22.800]  so that when we're having marches we could organize and say hey we're info warriors we're
[2:39:22.800 --> 2:39:28.000]  going to meet brother i believe me i'm got a good it department we're a small organization
[2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:32.080]  we're constantly trying to do that i think we have like chat stuff on the articles now
[2:39:32.080 --> 2:39:37.680]  in vando video but yeah we're trying to organize stuff believe me cool and then one other thing
[2:39:37.680 --> 2:39:41.600]  i'm just trying to brainstorm to help you because you're helping brother go ahead tell everybody
[2:39:41.600 --> 2:39:46.480]  also on your sharing or your links is there any way to get them to share just to a text message
[2:39:46.480 --> 2:39:50.480]  because some people don't have whatsapp some people don't oh my gosh yeah i don't we don't
[2:39:50.480 --> 2:39:54.720]  have a link to the text messages yeah they need to have the little green marker yeah because all
[2:39:54.720 --> 2:39:58.880]  it does is it goes to facebook twitter and then it'll go to whatsapp but it doesn't go to a regular
[2:39:58.880 --> 2:40:04.080]  text message you are a genius let me call just trying to help because i don't give facebook
[2:40:04.080 --> 2:40:08.080]  or twitter you're not trying to help brother you are helping let's do this right now we're calling
[2:40:08.080 --> 2:40:12.240]  right now they're evil bastards we're redoing info wars right now and updating it here we go
[2:40:13.600 --> 2:40:18.000]  that's cool man we do that i want to say hey i got you live on air this fellow wants you to put
[2:40:18.640 --> 2:40:23.360]  you know like in a text message like a green symbol like you have an iphone or android so we
[2:40:23.360 --> 2:40:28.160]  can have the symbol for people to send via text message on all the articles i think that's really
[2:40:28.160 --> 2:40:35.040]  smart yeah it is so let's add that to band dot video and uh let's add that uh but usually just
[2:40:35.040 --> 2:40:39.760]  the forward button like the square with an arrow up that that's all we that goes to everything right
[2:40:39.760 --> 2:40:42.320]  but i guess when you hit that it doesn't go to show a little green deal
[2:40:45.520 --> 2:40:48.800]  i believe it does that's that's how i always share articles with you and other people
[2:40:48.800 --> 2:40:58.480]  but we know you're evil deep state so all right all right listen make sure it happens thank you
[2:40:59.040 --> 2:41:04.160]  yes sir all right thank you sir to you sorry caller sorry i'm being silly erin go ahead that's
[2:41:04.160 --> 2:41:07.680]  all right keep up the fight brother keep up the fight man that's all i'm saying keep up the fight
[2:41:07.680 --> 2:41:11.200]  i just wanted to praise you i'd you know of course any other time i have like is there any
[2:41:11.200 --> 2:41:15.360]  things to say and then the one time i get through i'm like oh my god i forgot what i want to say
[2:41:15.360 --> 2:41:20.720]  so anyway i love you dude keep up the fight erin we love you and you know i i made the
[2:41:20.720 --> 2:41:25.440]  joke about Zimmerman that he's like 26 years old he's a great guy and i don't want to fight with
[2:41:25.440 --> 2:41:31.600]  the q people but it becomes like this larping like this imaginary secret agent thing and we're
[2:41:31.600 --> 2:41:37.200]  like back in junior high and then i see this stuff out like jones was ordered to get rid of millie
[2:41:37.200 --> 2:41:43.120]  weaver because his boss michael Zimmerman and rob do told him to and you know this is from the highest
[2:41:43.120 --> 2:41:49.040]  level q information and i'm just like come on i don't want to be mean to q but when anybody
[2:41:49.040 --> 2:41:55.200]  can say their q and then say you know forget roger stone he's an agent jones is an agent
[2:41:55.200 --> 2:42:02.320]  everyone's an agent but us it's it's ridiculous and i i i didn't mean to go off down that down
[2:42:02.320 --> 2:42:06.880]  that rabbit room oh it is ridiculous you know i think the path that one takes when you're red
[2:42:06.880 --> 2:42:10.640]  pill and you start going through the rabbit holes and you start pursuing truth uh robert
[2:42:10.640 --> 2:42:15.680]  anton wilson wrote about it that there's a period that you go through of pure paranoia
[2:42:15.680 --> 2:42:20.400]  and you must either pass through that or you'll just end up baking in paranoia forever and that's
[2:42:20.400 --> 2:42:24.880]  what we're seeing well that's it like we're we're saying don't trust the system awaken whatever
[2:42:24.880 --> 2:42:30.240]  so they create a spin-off group where any operative can say everybody else is not trustworthy
[2:42:30.240 --> 2:42:34.560]  and then they put out this info on the real leadership and then people once they bought
[2:42:34.560 --> 2:42:38.720]  into the fraud cannot admit that they're wrong exactly well the ego will keep them from ever
[2:42:38.720 --> 2:42:43.360]  admitting that they're wrong so they become just stuck in the false narrative and very
[2:42:43.360 --> 2:42:46.960]  few people ever have the strength to question their own ego so that's that's exactly what
[2:42:46.960 --> 2:42:50.640]  we're seeing and that's how this whole thing is being driven is by taking advantage of our ego
[2:42:51.440 --> 2:42:55.760]  and you know i blame our own media too people are so used to being lied to that they never
[2:42:55.760 --> 2:43:02.960]  know what they can trust anymore well that's it and and it's just so frustrating because all we
[2:43:02.960 --> 2:43:07.760]  do is expose the globalist and and all and i might try to stay out of this stuff with people
[2:43:07.760 --> 2:43:14.240]  and then they just won't stop because there's this power trip when you're lARPing in in in the queue
[2:43:14.240 --> 2:43:20.480]  thing where you're you're in the secret group you have the key intel and then some weirdo operative
[2:43:20.480 --> 2:43:24.560]  that's actually a globalist is manipulating you to attack people that are actually in the liberty
[2:43:24.560 --> 2:43:30.160]  movement but you can't admit it because you're you're so high on the idea that you're part
[2:43:30.960 --> 2:43:35.280]  of this you know big super thing when if you just went and videotaped the left attacking
[2:43:35.280 --> 2:43:39.120]  or you just went to church and woke folks up or you took care of your mom and your dad or you
[2:43:39.120 --> 2:43:44.880]  praise god or you had a garden just being a good person is what changes the world
[2:43:45.760 --> 2:43:49.840]  and just questioning things is what changes yourself if any of these people were just
[2:43:49.840 --> 2:43:54.480]  i mean nothing against q i i appreciate q i think q's been a huge red pill for the whole
[2:43:54.480 --> 2:43:59.040]  pedophilia thing but there's nothing wrong with questioning q there's nothing wrong with questioning
[2:43:59.040 --> 2:44:04.320]  anything if you because anybody can pose as the q thing well exactly and the only way any of us
[2:44:04.320 --> 2:44:09.520]  are going to find any semblance of truth is to question everything there is no one good source
[2:44:09.520 --> 2:44:12.400]  you know what that's what you're always telling everyone to research it for yourself and that
[2:44:12.400 --> 2:44:16.000]  is the only way or something the caller just called in and that's why i brought this up and he said
[2:44:17.200 --> 2:44:25.600]  give me lockstep and i want it to rockfeller.org i mean easy to find i'm always pulling it up
[2:44:25.600 --> 2:44:29.680]  myself i had a newspaper reporter call me this weekend and i'll talk to him and they go where's
[2:44:29.680 --> 2:44:34.800]  your proof bill gates admits 80 percent of people that take his vaccine gets sick and i sent him a
[2:44:34.800 --> 2:44:39.680]  cbs report where he admits it they were speechless said let's move on i said no we're not going to
[2:44:39.680 --> 2:44:47.840]  move on but that's been such a an age of laziness where people want you to do all the research
[2:44:47.840 --> 2:44:52.320]  for them and put everything out before them and that's why people are so easily manipulated and
[2:44:52.320 --> 2:44:56.720]  brainwashed because if it's not right in front of them in a 140 character tweet they don't have
[2:44:56.720 --> 2:45:01.440]  time for it they don't believe it they're moving on from it yeah it's all how it looks on the service
[2:45:01.440 --> 2:45:05.600]  whether it's real or not exactly and it's exactly how it's designed to be because the last thing that
[2:45:05.600 --> 2:45:08.720]  they want is a population to actually question things and look into things so that's what they
[2:45:08.720 --> 2:45:13.440]  want the quick response the low ego all emotion i mean that's why when i get up here and i say
[2:45:13.440 --> 2:45:19.600]  they want to post human world and to rewrite all carbon life forms that's officially club of Rome
[2:45:19.600 --> 2:45:25.280]  that's officially ray Kurzweil that's officially the wall street journal of course it's insane
[2:45:25.280 --> 2:45:30.640]  i feel insane saying it but they're this is the people run things believe this and it really
[2:45:30.640 --> 2:45:35.440]  so i gotta tell you it goes back for thousands of years i mean in the books of Sumer from uh
[2:45:35.440 --> 2:45:41.200]  Sumer and Mesopotamia they talked about a division between the the leadership where one side wanted
[2:45:41.200 --> 2:45:45.440]  to completely enslave people spiritually it was specifically saying spiritually which basically
[2:45:45.440 --> 2:45:49.760]  means you know thinking individually and following your heart and having them in their own control
[2:45:49.760 --> 2:45:54.080]  system right keeping them in a group mentality a group mind divide and conqueror so that they
[2:45:54.080 --> 2:45:58.800]  can just do we have free will or not free will it always well i mean i think we have free will
[2:45:58.800 --> 2:46:01.680]  and what they're doing is basically they're offering us i don't agree with their they're
[2:46:01.680 --> 2:46:05.200]  saying give us your free will yes exactly the handle hand over your free will we will tell
[2:46:05.200 --> 2:46:10.000]  you everything to do whatever is trendy you just gotta do whatever is trendy it's pop culture and
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:15.120]  the herd is always going to respond to the pop culture and nothing else it seems and so the
[2:46:15.120 --> 2:46:18.480]  only way to really change this ultimately is eventually they're gonna have to change the media
[2:46:18.480 --> 2:46:22.320]  they're gonna have to change the voice of the media because none of this would be possible
[2:46:22.320 --> 2:46:28.400]  without the media oh absolutely well here's an article arizona representative paul gozer child
[2:46:28.400 --> 2:46:34.320]  traveling in deep state a real systemic racism as a hoax challenging kevin mccarthy who is a
[2:46:34.320 --> 2:46:41.840]  horrible person now listen people say well wait are you for q or against it q only existed two years
[2:46:41.840 --> 2:46:49.840]  ago ted gunderson and anthony hilder and david ike 40 years ago with ted gunderson 30 years
[2:46:49.840 --> 2:46:53.920]  ago david ike i give credit where it's due it's not about of course people go well jones talked
[2:46:53.920 --> 2:47:00.000]  about it 26 years ago yeah of course i did but it's not about territorializing the q thing becomes
[2:47:00.000 --> 2:47:05.520]  like this like a gang in high school like oh you're not with the q you don't pay it you don't pay
[2:47:05.520 --> 2:47:10.880]  homage to the q and i'm like no but then kevin mccarthy the republican leader in the house comes
[2:47:10.880 --> 2:47:15.680]  out against it says there's no place for this anti-semitism saying there's child kidnapping
[2:47:15.680 --> 2:47:22.400]  rinks he's saying jews run any child kidnapping rinks no one said that that was a jewish thing
[2:47:22.400 --> 2:47:27.840]  they run but he says oh this q thing where the child kidnappings anti-semitic well i'm defending
[2:47:27.840 --> 2:47:32.880]  the good q people that care about the child trafficking and care about what's going on
[2:47:32.880 --> 2:47:37.920]  and are right and they're good people they got into a movement that other people can manipulate
[2:47:37.920 --> 2:47:43.760]  we're not saying you're bad we're saying whatever a random person says with the letter q if someone
[2:47:43.760 --> 2:47:49.680]  shows up at your house and says buy these magazine prescriptions for me i have a q you don't just bow
[2:47:49.680 --> 2:47:57.520]  down like they're the new priesthood okay so yes q 40 years ago told ted gunnerson what to do
[2:47:57.520 --> 2:48:04.240]  david ike myself q gave birth to me q is my father no it's not i just won't bow to it as the cult
[2:48:04.800 --> 2:48:11.200]  and say it's my god it's my king with random esoteric crap i'm alex jones i'm here on air
[2:48:11.200 --> 2:48:18.080]  telling you real stuff and i see the q manipulators disease people i know and ruin reporters we have
[2:48:18.080 --> 2:48:23.120]  and have them just say officially well q says you're a fed i'm with q and i watched that mental
[2:48:23.120 --> 2:48:28.480]  illness destroy people and it's bad but then i see the patriots take it over so the globalists ban it
[2:48:28.480 --> 2:48:35.200]  so there's a battle over it it was a sleeper product it wasn't popular at first but as people

[2:50:44.880 --> 2:50:48.640]  all right we got two segments left with spanner nendez and red reese only just many calls
[2:50:48.640 --> 2:50:52.560]  possible here i don't mean to go off in the whole queue jag it's just that i see
[2:50:54.400 --> 2:50:59.920]  kevin mccarthy the leader of the house republicans come out and attack it and say there's no child
[2:50:59.920 --> 2:51:06.080]  trafficking but then you notice the dialectic it's q now represents resisting child trafficking
[2:51:07.280 --> 2:51:11.440]  and then it's always q people saying don't listen to anyone but us and then it's just random people
[2:51:11.440 --> 2:51:18.240]  on the internet esoterically hiddenly telling you something when we're just out in the open so we're
[2:51:18.240 --> 2:51:23.920]  not in competition a lot of good people believe in this q stuff i believe q should mean research
[2:51:24.800 --> 2:51:29.360]  research the deep state research the new order then it'll be a good thing but if it's weird
[2:51:29.920 --> 2:51:34.480]  globalist and democrats posing and getting patriots to fight with each other i think it's bad
[2:51:35.360 --> 2:51:39.200]  yeah well absolutely and i think those people that are totally religious into the q thing that
[2:51:39.200 --> 2:51:45.200]  accuse info wars of being massad agents simply because q wrote it are demonstrating to everyone
[2:51:45.200 --> 2:51:49.600]  who's paying attention that they are not doing that that they're not researching anything and even q
[2:51:49.600 --> 2:51:54.320]  himself suggests that that's what you're supposed to do is bat is looking at this stuff asking questions
[2:51:54.320 --> 2:51:58.800]  and stuff so anyway as we as one go we all go but yeah trumps the one moving the u.s embassy
[2:51:59.520 --> 2:52:03.680]  to jerusalem trumps pro-israel i'm not against israel but we're not we're not front and center
[2:52:03.680 --> 2:52:08.560]  about israel all day which shows the double they can't attack trump so they attack all of his
[2:52:08.560 --> 2:52:13.520]  subsidiary supporters yes oh roger stones one of them and rob dues one of them and oh and shroy
[2:52:13.520 --> 2:52:17.920]  alex jones is one of them oh but trumps good because they can't get him so they just cut
[2:52:17.920 --> 2:52:22.560]  everything out from under him and again it's not all the q people folks but there's bad people
[2:52:22.560 --> 2:52:27.600]  posing as q operatives it's it's very simple but there's a mental illness once someone like a
[2:52:27.600 --> 2:52:33.440]  baby chicken we wake them up we don't put them in a cult so they run over and get picked up by a cult
[2:52:33.440 --> 2:52:40.400]  yeah savannah i completely agree that researching is something that is very important that everyone
[2:52:40.400 --> 2:52:44.800]  needs to do for themselves i mean you know no matter what we're talking about the q movement
[2:52:44.800 --> 2:52:50.640]  any political subject everyone should research and do all of these these important things but
[2:52:50.640 --> 2:52:56.560]  exactly but kevin mccarthy says it's bad no but but here's the thing notice by them making q is
[2:52:56.560 --> 2:53:02.000]  about the pedophile rings now they can bring it down and have q put out this info discredit it
[2:53:02.800 --> 2:53:07.920]  no humanity is exposing with shaltraffing absolutely we're doing it trumps fighting it
[2:53:07.920 --> 2:53:13.280]  it q doesn't own it so they can then attack q and destroy it see how that works alice jones
[2:53:13.280 --> 2:53:18.080]  doesn't own it you don't own it it's the right thing and the only thing that's gonna that's
[2:53:18.080 --> 2:53:21.520]  going to change anything in my in my opinion because the average person who doesn't care
[2:53:21.520 --> 2:53:26.640]  about any of this stuff assumes that this career that any lesser crime is just a natural part of
[2:53:26.640 --> 2:53:31.120]  politics but this is the only crime that i can think of that's going to cause those average people
[2:53:31.120 --> 2:53:35.920]  to actually draw yeah take take action and that's what we need we need the majority of the people
[2:53:35.920 --> 2:53:41.280]  to take action man i just know it's so obvious people used to ask me a thousand times do you
[2:53:41.280 --> 2:53:46.800]  support anonymous i said a guy on a guy fox mask i could go buy a guy fox mask say whatever i wanted
[2:53:46.800 --> 2:53:53.840]  behind it do i i go it's the particular message i have to look at but it becomes this it goes back
[2:53:53.840 --> 2:53:58.800]  to oracle of delphi and other oracles anybody they want to could speak to the mountain and they
[2:53:58.800 --> 2:54:02.480]  said oh you're getting the voice of the gods of the oracles through it and people bought it
[2:54:02.480 --> 2:54:07.760]  to this cult it was a scam so people love something i'm so terrified if they that you know they love
[2:54:07.760 --> 2:54:14.560]  something that's very uh gnostic and that's a red flag we see that with antifa as well they hate
[2:54:14.560 --> 2:54:18.880]  cameras in their faces they hate cameras there they're afraid of cameras they have masks on and
[2:54:18.880 --> 2:54:24.320]  what does that tell you that should tell a reasonable thinking person that if one side is hiding and
[2:54:24.320 --> 2:54:27.520]  they're afraid of cameras that maybe you should bring into question and question why and it's the
[2:54:27.520 --> 2:54:34.640]  same thing you know with uh with the whole the whole pedophilia thing and the whole and and
[2:54:34.640 --> 2:54:37.920]  they want to traffic kids while there's mass we're looking for kids that are being trafficked
[2:54:37.920 --> 2:54:41.760]  now they're all wearing masks and again there are a lot of good people that project their goodness
[2:54:41.760 --> 2:54:47.120]  onto q and so they're like well i'm good i'm spreading the links good great do it i'm just saying
[2:54:48.160 --> 2:54:54.320]  time and time again the hardcore deep q what you know the orifice whether it's the mouth or the
[2:54:54.320 --> 2:54:59.360]  butt whatever you want to call it these these deliveries come out and say that trump's biggest
[2:54:59.360 --> 2:55:05.840]  supporters are not the good guys and robert muller is well come on folks you're being chumped yeah the
[2:55:05.840 --> 2:55:10.560]  future means that we have to become all critical thinkers if we're going to recreate we're going
[2:55:10.560 --> 2:55:14.960]  to restore the republic and create any kind of a golden age that's going to require critical
[2:55:14.960 --> 2:55:21.200]  thinking on all parts and questioning is the way you get there information war and anything else so
[2:55:21.200 --> 2:55:27.360]  tariff that gives you codes and weird stuff to project onto is very dangerous and should set up
[2:55:27.360 --> 2:55:33.040]  a red flag absolutely that's the most important thing to question our mind is very tricky if we
[2:55:33.040 --> 2:55:36.960]  don't understand our own mind and the information we're getting and we'll fall for anything phone
[2:55:36.960 --> 2:55:50.000]  calls are 60 seconds away you hear that that's the march of the united nations and the bill
[2:55:50.000 --> 2:55:56.560]  mill and the gates foundation coming with their battle plan psychological warfare operation
[2:55:56.560 --> 2:56:02.880]  with the forced inoculations and the permanent lockdown of civilization and society they're
[2:56:02.880 --> 2:56:08.320]  outlawing people being able to get colds or the flu they're creating artificial phobias for normal
[2:56:08.320 --> 2:56:12.880]  death that takes place they're not even promising to have a cure to it all they're just inflicting
[2:56:12.880 --> 2:56:20.480]  new phobias on everyone to bring in their planetary regime directed by the who with vaccines that
[2:56:20.480 --> 2:56:29.360]  actually change your dna and make you owned by microsoft it's a final frontier it's the year 2020
[2:56:29.360 --> 2:56:45.280]  it's not coming it's here and submission is blood in the water
[2:56:46.320 --> 2:56:55.840]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones you keep saying you've got something for me
[2:56:55.840 --> 2:57:01.600]  all right i didn't mean to go off onto a qjag earlier i want to explain to people
[2:57:02.560 --> 2:57:07.520]  i'm all about questioning i'm all about being involved when i tell you something i'll say
[2:57:07.520 --> 2:57:16.080]  here's the document us code title 50 cap or 32 subsection 1520 a paragraph b that's the legalization
[2:57:16.080 --> 2:57:22.240]  of secret testing on american people i want it repealed when i tell you that it says this in
[2:57:22.240 --> 2:57:27.600]  tragedy and hope or the day the rock of hellers book i tell you but i love the average q people
[2:57:27.600 --> 2:57:31.760]  out on the street a lot of my listeners they love me i love them they're exposing the pedophile rings
[2:57:31.760 --> 2:57:37.840]  they're looking for evidence they're doing great research i love them i'm saying when something
[2:57:37.840 --> 2:57:43.520]  secret like a hole in the ground might be a rattlesnake might be nothing down there you stick
[2:57:43.520 --> 2:57:50.720]  your hand down you got to be careful so i'm not here to even in fight with the q thing i've just
[2:57:50.720 --> 2:57:58.000]  seen people posing as q people go in infiltrate my operation and say they have secret info with
[2:57:58.000 --> 2:58:02.800]  no evidence and hurt people that are doing a great job that i've been supporting for eight years
[2:58:02.800 --> 2:58:11.520]  and it hurts because it's like this is like it's q oh oh like the angels are seeing or something
[2:58:11.520 --> 2:58:16.320]  so i'm done talking about that savannah hernandez regrease i want to hit some other news before
[2:58:16.320 --> 2:58:20.400]  journalists once it takes over i'll take a few final calls here but just in general what's your gut
[2:58:20.400 --> 2:58:27.280]  level view on this election you think trump's head i think he is yeah i think that we trump has a great
[2:58:27.280 --> 2:58:32.080]  chance of winning this election i really do because again like we're seeing the democrats
[2:58:32.080 --> 2:58:37.760]  and just all of these blue cities are the example of what america will look like if
[2:58:37.760 --> 2:58:41.920]  joe biden gets elected to office but even bigger than that it's our whole entire nation at stake
[2:58:41.920 --> 2:58:46.240]  it's our constitutional rights at stake and people are waking up to that every single day
[2:58:46.240 --> 2:58:50.880]  through these coveted lockdowns through these protests and riots through the fact that we have
[2:58:50.880 --> 2:58:56.480]  like you said uh hollywood all our mainstream media propping up blm and pushing it and using it
[2:58:57.040 --> 2:59:02.640]  as basically the front for the democrats i mean everyone sees this now everyone's really waking
[2:59:02.640 --> 2:59:08.240]  up because of all of this violence because of how extreme the democrat party has gotten it's waking
[2:59:08.240 --> 2:59:13.520]  up a lot of people so i think it's really good chances for trump and i mean continue letting
[2:59:13.520 --> 2:59:18.160]  the democrats destroy these cities and wake more people up every day i totally agree with you
[2:59:18.160 --> 2:59:22.800]  let's take some phone calls quickly here charlie in fema region five thanks for holding you're on

[3:00:50.480 --> 3:00:55.840]  probably assume they're gonna maybe stage some false flags you know blaming on us and then
[3:00:55.840 --> 3:01:01.120]  start coming out there you know you're dead right i think the last ingredient is a mass shooting or
[3:01:01.120 --> 3:01:06.000]  a bombing to blame the patriots i think with 70 days out i think within like i think 30 days
[3:01:06.000 --> 3:01:09.520]  out from the election they they do a false flag we'll talk about that moment great point charlie
[3:01:09.520 --> 3:01:13.440]  i'm glad you called false flag gut level what do you think yeah you know i hate to admit it but
[3:01:13.440 --> 3:01:17.680]  that i yeah i agree i you know the optimist that's the last card they played other than the big war
[3:01:17.680 --> 3:01:23.520]  well absolutely and bill gates himself even said you know the bio weapon attack and iran's all ready
[3:01:23.520 --> 3:01:27.280]  to go oh he said coming next the terrorists are gonna buy a weapon yeah and the thing is if you were
[3:01:27.280 --> 3:01:32.080]  to have if you were to stage even iran attacking was to the bio weapon no one would question that
[3:01:32.960 --> 3:01:38.240]  you know and how devastating could that be and you know we've had our media that already is so
[3:01:38.240 --> 3:01:43.520]  excellent at manipulating the average person they have a hold on this whole entire nation so whatever
[3:01:43.520 --> 3:01:47.920]  the media wants to put out about the right wing upcoming in these next 70 days is going to be
[3:01:47.920 --> 3:01:52.960]  biblical truth to a huge majority of the name absolutely right all right good point let's go

[3:02:40.960 --> 3:02:49.280]  over a thousand definitely going by law under the geneva convention and the nirnberg trials
[3:02:49.280 --> 3:02:54.240]  they have to have exemptions and waivers so they color of law say it's mandatory even fox news
[3:02:54.240 --> 3:02:59.040]  just admitted put the headline back up with a few exemptions it's all crap but you're absolutely
[3:02:59.040 --> 3:03:04.720]  right they're trying to make it mandatory right now yeah they're um they did do the religious
[3:03:04.720 --> 3:03:10.320]  and medical exemption on it um i have a feeling with how many people are going to apply for it
[3:03:10.320 --> 3:03:14.800]  they're going to try to go after that as well well these politicians are going to be led exemptions
[3:03:14.800 --> 3:03:21.200]  soon yeah um like i said and this is in a protest that's you know just republican or whatever it's

[3:03:45.280 --> 3:03:49.920]  what the world health organization too saying that they don't know how vaccines are going to react
[3:03:49.920 --> 3:03:53.920]  in your body when they give them to you when mass so they don't seem something that's going to be
[3:03:53.920 --> 3:03:57.520]  mass produced does not seem very healthy to me and yeah they said that face masks were required to
[3:03:57.520 --> 3:04:02.080]  when i haven't been doing that so probably not for the vaccine either great point all right um

[3:13:09.760 --> 3:13:19.120]  sweden this is from tomorrow's trends journals going out and again if you want to see history
[3:13:19.120 --> 3:13:24.000]  before it happens and read all about it and prepare for the future there's only magazine that doesn't
[3:13:24.560 --> 3:13:30.000]  well american most of the world marched off to the covet war sweden did not ask most americans
[3:13:30.000 --> 3:13:35.920]  what was the result of their resisting any form of lockdown swedens and they will say
[3:13:36.640 --> 3:13:42.320]  covid killed more swedes per capita because they tonight fight against a deadly virus however as
[3:13:42.320 --> 3:13:51.760]  we've detailed when i when in fact that is false as we have detailed statistics to hear the hard
[3:13:51.760 --> 3:14:00.080]  facts and now sweden's top infectious disease expert andres tingel won that quote it's very
[3:14:00.080 --> 3:14:08.080]  dangerous to believe face masks would change the game when it comes to covet 19 mr tangles said
[3:14:08.080 --> 3:14:14.880]  quote with numbers diminishing very quickly in sweden we see no point in wearing a face mask in
[3:14:14.880 --> 3:14:24.720]  sweden not even on public transport and making a statement that is never heard by the mainstream
[3:14:24.720 --> 3:14:32.160]  experts of most nations mr tingel noted quote the findings that have been produced through face
[3:14:32.160 --> 3:14:41.360]  through face masks are astonishingly weak even though so many people around the world wear them
[3:14:43.280 --> 3:14:51.920]  the epidemiologist also declared that quote i'm surprised that we don't have more or better studies

[3:32:48.960 --> 3:32:54.400]  are going to transcend and become gods and attain immortality but the price for that is to carry
[3:32:54.400 --> 3:33:01.760]  out the orderly extermination of all carbon based line forms that's why they say carbon is bad
[3:33:01.760 --> 3:33:08.640]  they are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet they are playing god they believe they have
[3:33:08.640 --> 3:33:15.600]  been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology to carry out
[3:33:15.600 --> 3:33:20.800]  this transformation i know this sounds insane but if you read the writings of the globalist
[3:33:20.800 --> 3:33:29.520]  it's all on record you have been warned you have been given the information to say no to this plan

[3:33:48.240 --> 3:33:53.520]  into a civil war by contesting the election they are openly wargaming this at the highest
[3:33:53.520 --> 3:33:58.560]  levels of democratic party nancy polosian others have gone on television and said they will contest
[3:33:58.560 --> 3:34:04.880]  the election trump is going they will hold a separate inauguration for biden and kamala harris
[3:34:04.880 --> 3:34:09.600]  and that anyone challenging that will be called a racist they will then trigger race riots and
[3:34:09.600 --> 3:34:15.840]  violence they've already beta tested around the country we are not living in normal times when
[3:34:15.840 --> 3:34:20.080]  these type of things happen in history people are usually caught flat-footed because they can't
[3:34:20.080 --> 3:34:25.520]  believe that they're living in such a criminal era we are we are living in the period where this
[3:34:25.520 --> 3:34:30.800]  criminal globalist syndicate has been feeding on america is being exposed and removed now is the
[3:34:30.800 --> 3:34:35.520]  time for all good men and women to come to their aid of the country spread the word now paul reveres

[3:42:43.840 --> 3:42:50.480]  saluted stalin the people by the numbers are gutless but it does not take a majority to prevail
[3:42:50.480 --> 3:42:56.240]  but rather an irate tireless minority keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men
