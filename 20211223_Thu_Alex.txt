[00:00.000 --> 00:27.220]  I'm watching the back stuff and I'm truly horrified by it on a real level and I've become
[00:27.220 --> 00:35.760]  totally intolerant of it because it's too much, it's too cruel, it hurts too many people.
[00:35.760 --> 00:42.880]  Nobody wants to say this but obviously it's class war against the weakest people.
[00:42.880 --> 00:47.400]  In the end, only Salvador and Busboys will have masks on because the peasants can't look
[00:47.400 --> 00:48.400]  at their leaders.
[00:48.400 --> 00:51.980]  That's what it's actually about and the back stuff is about punishing people who have
[00:51.980 --> 00:53.140]  no one to protect them.
[00:53.140 --> 00:54.140]  That's the truth.
[00:54.140 --> 00:58.120]  I'm completely sick of it and I'm going to soon be selling mugs that say naturally
[00:58.120 --> 01:06.400]  immune because if you're naturally immune, you earned it and I mean that.
[01:06.400 --> 01:13.320]  If you have earned it and I know some in the room have, you earned it.
[01:13.320 --> 01:18.120]  Some people really earned it at a high cost and you should be proud of it and you should
[01:18.120 --> 01:22.240]  let anybody make you feel bad about it, boss you around about it, make you do anything you
[01:22.240 --> 01:23.240]  don't want to do.
[01:23.240 --> 01:24.240]  I get that.
[01:24.240 --> 01:26.040]  I'm like what is this?
[01:26.040 --> 01:29.360]  Both the president and I are Vax and did you get the booster?
[01:29.360 --> 01:30.360]  Yes.
[01:30.360 --> 01:31.360]  I got it too.
[01:31.360 --> 01:35.960]  Okay, so don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[01:35.960 --> 01:36.960]  That's how it is.
[01:36.960 --> 01:37.960]  There's a very tiny group over there.
[01:37.960 --> 01:42.240]  So you heard some members of the crowd booing there and this was at a pro-Trump event and
[01:42.240 --> 01:46.880]  look we've seen this at Trump rallies before where his supporters are booing the fact that
[01:46.880 --> 01:48.760]  he is getting a booster or a vaccine.
[01:48.760 --> 01:54.560]  I recommend take the vaccines, I did it, it's good, take the vaccines, but you got down,
[01:54.560 --> 01:56.760]  that's okay, that's all right.
[01:56.760 --> 01:58.520]  You got your freedoms.
[01:58.520 --> 02:04.080]  This speaks to the exact problem here with which Americans to a large degree are still
[02:04.080 --> 02:08.120]  very resistant to getting these boosters or the vaccine in the first place.
[02:08.120 --> 02:13.160]  Well hopefully his supporters let it sink in and go get boosted or go get that first vaccine
[02:13.160 --> 02:15.840]  now that they know the former president.
[02:15.840 --> 02:17.880]  It didn't sound like it there, they'd like to resist.
[02:17.880 --> 02:21.480]  They were booing him, which just doesn't make any sense.
[02:21.480 --> 02:28.040]  President Trump is very proud that his administration developed that vaccine, that's the bottom
[02:28.040 --> 02:29.040]  line on it.
[02:29.040 --> 02:31.320]  Well look, and I think they, I think they should be.
[02:31.320 --> 02:34.160]  The vaccine has been proven to kill exactly zero.
[02:34.160 --> 02:38.560]  The Orange County Coroner's Office is investigating the death of a woman who passed away several
[02:38.560 --> 02:41.000]  days after getting her second Moderna vaccine.
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.560]  The Lisa Shaw died after complications of the AstraZeneca COVID vaccination.
[02:45.560 --> 02:50.920]  Today could be your lucky day, California's first vaccine lottery drawing takes place
[02:50.920 --> 02:51.920]  tonight.
[02:51.920 --> 02:53.520]  That's right, you could win one million dollars.
[02:53.520 --> 02:55.280]  You want to be part of the fun?
[02:55.280 --> 02:56.280]  Get vaccinated.
[02:56.280 --> 03:00.840]  Residents that have been vaccinated could receive incentives like free haircuts and
[03:00.840 --> 03:01.840]  even manicures.
[03:01.840 --> 03:05.600]  Did you say free fries when you get vaccinated?
[03:05.600 --> 03:06.600]  I got vaccinated.
[03:06.600 --> 03:10.320]  You're saying I could get this, you delicious fries?
[03:10.320 --> 03:12.640]  Joints for jabs, that's what they're calling it.
[03:12.640 --> 03:16.880]  Free joints today to those who could prove they got the COVID vaccine.
[03:16.880 --> 03:20.520]  There's also a burner element to this.
[03:20.520 --> 03:23.720]  You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.
[03:23.720 --> 03:27.560]  We're increasingly hearing about fully vaccinated people infected with COVID.
[03:27.560 --> 03:28.560]  Did you get the booster?
[03:28.560 --> 03:29.560]  Yes.
[03:29.560 --> 03:30.560]  I got it too.
[03:30.560 --> 03:35.320]  I don't care if you're Donald Trump, I don't care if you're Bill Gates, I don't care who
[03:35.320 --> 03:36.320]  you are.
[03:36.320 --> 03:41.120]  You come at children, experimental, Nuremberg code, violating vaccines that you broke the
[03:41.120 --> 03:48.240]  water ramp through, you are terrorist in league with Joseph Mengele 2.0.
[03:48.240 --> 03:52.400]  We have a player down on the court who will try to get more information.
[03:52.400 --> 04:00.400]  Johnson taken out on a stretcher and rushed to local Tallahassee Memorial Hospital.
[04:00.400 --> 04:05.600]  Leading cardiologist says cluster of collapses and footballers likely to be just a coincidence,
[04:05.600 --> 04:09.600]  a terrible coincidence at that, but just a coincidence, yes, just a coincidence.
[04:09.600 --> 04:17.200]  Is that a shun people into getting vaccinated?
[04:17.200 --> 04:19.320]  You really need to get vaccinated.
[04:19.320 --> 04:20.320]  Get vaccinated.
[04:20.320 --> 04:25.320]  Listen to our government agencies, these guys are telling the truth, there's no conspiracy
[04:25.320 --> 04:29.280]  here folks, just get your damn vaccine.
[04:29.280 --> 04:33.120]  I recommend taking the vaccines.
[04:33.120 --> 04:48.080]  Take the vaccines, take the vaccines, take the vaccines, take the vaccines.
[04:48.080 --> 05:01.280]  Get ready folks, it's Thursday, December 23rd, start your engines.
[05:01.280 --> 05:05.240]  It's the end of World War II, the globalists have been building their private corporate
[05:05.240 --> 05:10.600]  world government whose end game once they get control is forced depopulation of the
[05:10.600 --> 05:11.600]  planet.
[05:11.600 --> 05:15.880]  That's why as we begin to leave the year 2021 and go into 2022, I am encouraging all
[05:15.880 --> 05:19.840]  of you out there watching and listening to count the cost and to realize how much danger
[05:19.840 --> 05:21.680]  you and your family are in.
[05:21.680 --> 05:23.800]  The globalists are coming after everybody.
[05:23.800 --> 05:31.160]  They are setting up a dystopic planetary authoritarian technocracy, a dictatorship of the globalist.
[05:31.160 --> 05:33.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, Info Wars is the tip of the spear.
[05:33.520 --> 05:37.000]  Your investment in us over the years, buying our products, spreading the word and praying
[05:37.000 --> 05:41.120]  for us has been incredible, but I'm telling you right now, we're about to lose not just
[05:41.120 --> 05:44.080]  Info Wars, but the entire country and the world of tyranny.
[05:44.080 --> 05:48.800]  So now, everything you've done in the past needs to be redoubled today and InfoWarStore.com
[05:48.800 --> 05:52.440]  is one of the most important places you can go to buy great products and fund the tip
[05:52.440 --> 05:53.440]  of the spear.
[05:53.440 --> 05:54.440]  I will go down with the ship.
[05:54.440 --> 05:55.440]  I'm not going to back down.
[05:55.440 --> 05:58.920]  I'm getting even more hardcore in their face, but I can't stay in the fight at 100% unless
[05:58.920 --> 06:11.240]  you support us, so please go to InfoWars.com.
[06:11.240 --> 06:23.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[06:23.520 --> 06:32.440]  This Thursday, December 23rd, the year is 2021, I am your host Alex Jones and Jack Pasobix,
[06:32.440 --> 06:40.640]  a very smart patriotic American, and he sent out this viral tweet that said, pretty clear,
[06:40.640 --> 06:47.840]  Biden is only crediting Trump for the vaccine to set him up to take the blame for what comes
[06:47.840 --> 06:49.840]  next.
[06:49.840 --> 06:56.280]  And it's in the SPARS 2023-2025, John Hopkins Rockefeller Foundation, Bill and Melinda Gates,
[06:56.280 --> 07:01.800]  Pentagon joint operation that it will come out that these are not vaccines and have killed
[07:01.800 --> 07:03.080]  people en masse.
[07:03.080 --> 07:06.920]  That's part of discrediting the government and collapsing the Western world.
[07:06.920 --> 07:09.840]  It's all been preplanned.
[07:09.840 --> 07:13.120]  That's how we tell you exactly what's coming next.
[07:13.120 --> 07:18.000]  Like the announcement that, oh, God, I have three shots to be fully vaccinated and ooh,
[07:18.000 --> 07:22.600]  God, I need a fourth, ooh, they're already up to their fifth in Israel, Europe and the
[07:22.600 --> 07:29.200]  UK are already up to their fourth, and I knew 21 months ago that it would be 9 to 12 shots
[07:29.200 --> 07:30.200]  a year.
[07:30.200 --> 07:31.200]  Why did I know that?
[07:31.200 --> 07:36.200]  Because Bill Gates said so.
[07:36.200 --> 07:38.040]  Bill Gates wants to depopulate you.
[07:38.040 --> 07:39.760]  Bill Gates thinks you're subhuman.
[07:39.760 --> 07:40.760]  And you know what?
[07:40.760 --> 07:43.840]  If you don't stand up against him, you are.
[07:43.840 --> 07:49.720]  You sit test, ladies and gentlemen, pretty clear, yeah, pretty clear, like a crystal
[07:49.720 --> 07:55.080]  clear mountaintop morning, that Biden is only crediting Trump for the vaccines to set him
[07:55.080 --> 07:58.800]  up to take the blame for what comes next.
[07:58.800 --> 08:05.520]  Okay, we reached the quickening years ago, but there's no way to do justice to all these
[08:05.520 --> 08:06.840]  stories.
[08:06.840 --> 08:10.840]  These articles are not props, as I've said many times.
[08:10.840 --> 08:16.520]  All of these, you could talk for an entire four hours on each one.
[08:16.520 --> 08:17.520]  Let me just do this.
[08:17.520 --> 08:23.280]  Let me try, let me try to just do this.
[08:23.280 --> 08:27.440]  Let me try to just read a few stacks right now, just the headlines here.
[08:27.440 --> 08:30.080]  Here, let's look at one of the COVID stacks.
[08:30.080 --> 08:32.880]  Supreme Court will hold special hearing on vaccines in January.
[08:32.880 --> 08:37.680]  Again, they're not vaccines, it's the genetic therapy injection revolution.
[08:37.680 --> 08:41.760]  New emails reveal evidence of government efforts to suppress free speech across the United
[08:41.760 --> 08:42.760]  States.
[08:42.760 --> 08:48.160]  It's all confirmed to, quote, crush us, destroy us, silence top scientist.
[08:48.160 --> 08:52.600]  Emergency powers deployed to impose vaccine passports across the United States in blue
[08:52.600 --> 08:56.760]  cities saying that if you get caught out without your passport, you're going to go to jail.
[08:56.760 --> 08:59.880]  See that's martial law.
[08:59.880 --> 09:04.840]  UN directed global government, Boston, New York, LA, the list goes on and on.
[09:04.840 --> 09:10.080]  Over time's up, Chicago mayor threatens unvaccinated with draconian measures said you're not allowed
[09:10.080 --> 09:13.880]  to sit down at restaurants, you can only come to the counter repeating what was done to
[09:13.880 --> 09:19.840]  black people in this country, literal discrimination against everybody who's un-injected.
[09:19.840 --> 09:20.840]  Jesus would get vaccinated.
[09:20.840 --> 09:26.480]  Archbishop of Canterbury suggests Australia's chief pharmacist says public needs to accept
[09:26.480 --> 09:29.480]  boosters and mask mandates for many years to come.
[09:29.480 --> 09:30.480]  They're all saying that.
[09:30.480 --> 09:32.000]  Now, here's the big one.
[09:32.000 --> 09:33.520]  Oh, we can talk again.
[09:33.520 --> 09:42.200]  The judge ordered them a month ago to every month release 500 pages and they just released
[09:42.200 --> 09:49.480]  more and it's thousands of more deaths and 160 plus thousand adverse reactions just at
[09:49.480 --> 09:50.480]  the start.
[09:50.480 --> 09:53.680]  Oh, but don't worry, you'll get all the documents soon.
[09:53.680 --> 10:01.440]  The court obliged them and said the document dump must be done in 75 years.
[10:01.440 --> 10:04.880]  They had asked for 55 and they said no, no, no, no, no.
[10:04.880 --> 10:11.640]  You get until close to the year 2100, just a few shots.
[10:11.640 --> 10:16.480]  Well, we're not living in tyranny or anything.
[10:16.480 --> 10:20.200]  By the way, you know earlier this week from the Netherlands and other countries, people
[10:20.200 --> 10:25.280]  did FOIA requests, they have similar laws there and got the emails from the Davos group
[10:25.280 --> 10:30.240]  telling the prime ministers and leaders what to do in the Build Back Better agenda as if
[10:30.240 --> 10:33.200]  we need the memos to know they're being commanded from a central group.
[10:33.200 --> 10:37.320]  They're following the exact same operations, same names, same groups to bankrupt industrial
[10:37.320 --> 10:39.040]  society in a transition.
[10:39.040 --> 10:40.840]  Oh, your fuel costs more.
[10:40.840 --> 10:44.920]  You're in a transition now, said the head of the Department of Energy a month ago.
[10:44.920 --> 10:47.640]  We're going to bankrupt all combustion engines.
[10:47.640 --> 10:55.200]  California just banned them in small vehicles and things like lawnmowers and leafblowers.
[10:55.200 --> 11:03.800]  So I mean, it's here, but all they have Reuters and AP and PolitiFact and the BBC, a big stack.
[11:03.800 --> 11:06.320]  There's no Build Back Better, there's no great reset.
[11:06.320 --> 11:10.560]  It's all made up, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:10.560 --> 11:13.160]  Glashwab isn't on TV commanding everything.
[11:13.160 --> 11:14.560]  People don't go and bow before him.
[11:14.560 --> 11:19.680]  He's not announcing forced injections and microchips to buy and sell even though he
[11:19.680 --> 11:20.680]  is.
[11:20.680 --> 11:24.680]  Oh, no, Reuters said it's all lies.
[11:24.680 --> 11:29.120]  It's all, and the head of Reuters is on the board of Pfizer.
[11:29.120 --> 11:34.320]  Continuing, sorry, I got stuck on that one because this is a massive story right here
[11:34.320 --> 11:37.320]  and the documents that are in it, which I'm sorry, I haven't had the chance to read them
[11:37.320 --> 11:38.320]  all.
[11:38.320 --> 11:41.560]  I just read the synopsis, but thousands of more deaths, thousands of more miscarriages
[11:41.560 --> 11:47.160]  bleeding out of your nose, having convulsions, becoming paralyzed, becoming blind, your ovaries
[11:47.160 --> 11:48.160]  basically dissolving.
[11:48.160 --> 11:53.760]  Uh-oh, oh, and I've got more on that, but it's all liberal, it's so trendy.
[11:53.760 --> 12:00.240]  Another Norwegian study finds COVID-19 vaccines interfere with young women's periods and basically
[12:00.240 --> 12:02.920]  give you endometriosis where your uterus has got to be removed.
[12:02.920 --> 12:06.360]  Well, that's because your body then attacks the spike protein, which is what?
[12:06.360 --> 12:08.360]  A fast-growing protein.
[12:08.360 --> 12:10.160]  What does a woman grow in her uterus?
[12:10.160 --> 12:18.240]  A fast-growing protein almost identical to blood, which is the exact same thing Dr.
[12:18.240 --> 12:20.520]  Yedon a year and a half ago warned.
[12:20.520 --> 12:26.440]  He said this spike protein in the virus is almost identical to the lining that the women
[12:26.440 --> 12:34.520]  grow every month so that an egg can implant and then become an embryo, the fertilized
[12:34.520 --> 12:36.640]  egg, the zygote.
[12:36.640 --> 12:41.200]  And he said this will attack women's ovaries because it's full of the fast-growing protein
[12:41.200 --> 12:50.160]  and it will attack their uterus and bingo, bingo, bingo, it's depopulation, it's sterilization.
[12:50.160 --> 12:55.680]  You get a heart attack, you get sterilized, you get cancer, you get an autoimmune disease,
[12:55.680 --> 13:01.920]  you get ADE, you get prion growth in your brain.
[13:01.920 --> 13:04.240]  Speaking of Dr. Yedon, let's play that clip.
[13:04.240 --> 13:08.760]  Former chief scientist at Pfizer, head of the virology department, head of the vaccine
[13:08.760 --> 13:15.840]  program saying this is a depopulation operation to kill you, but he's just a top scientist.
[13:15.840 --> 13:16.840]  We shouldn't listen to him.
[13:16.840 --> 13:17.840]  Here he is.
[13:17.840 --> 13:25.680]  So, when your government scientists tell you that a variant that's 0.3% different from
[13:25.680 --> 13:31.880]  SARS could masquerade as a new virus and be a threat to your health, you should know and
[13:31.880 --> 13:35.600]  I'm telling you they are lying.
[13:35.600 --> 13:43.040]  If they're lying and they are, why is the pharmaceutical industry making top-up vaccines?
[13:43.040 --> 13:44.440]  They are making them.
[13:44.440 --> 13:51.320]  You should be terrified at this point as I am because there's absolutely no possible justification
[13:51.320 --> 13:56.680]  for their manufacture, but they're being made and the world's medicines regulators have said
[13:56.680 --> 14:01.680]  because they're quite similar to the original vaccines, the ones that are being given now,
[14:01.680 --> 14:04.280]  we won't be asking them to do any clinical safety studies.
[14:04.280 --> 14:08.760]  So, let me just say again, the variants are not different enough to represent a threat
[14:08.760 --> 14:09.760]  to you.
[14:09.760 --> 14:14.400]  You do not need top-up vaccines yet, they are being made and the regulators have more
[14:14.400 --> 14:17.040]  or less waved them through.
[14:17.040 --> 14:18.720]  I'm very frightened of that.
[14:18.720 --> 14:23.000]  There's no possible benign interpretation of this.
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.120]  I believe that they're going to be used to damage your health and possibly kill you,
[14:27.120 --> 14:28.120]  seriously.
[14:28.120 --> 14:34.920]  I can see no sensible interpretation other than a serious attempt at mass depopulation.
[14:34.920 --> 14:40.840]  This will provide the tools to do it and plausible deniability because they'll create another
[14:40.840 --> 14:45.720]  story about some sort of biological threat and you'll line up and get your top-up vaccines
[14:45.720 --> 14:52.440]  in a few months or a year or so later, you'll die of some peculiar, explicable syndrome and
[14:52.440 --> 14:56.520]  they won't be able to associate it with the top-up vaccines, but that's my belief that
[14:56.520 --> 15:02.920]  they're lying to you about variants so they can make damaging top-up vaccines that you
[15:02.920 --> 15:06.440]  don't need at all and I think they'll be used for malign purposes.
[15:06.440 --> 15:10.840]  And if you don't wake up, that's what's going to happen I think during next year.
[15:10.840 --> 15:13.760]  Dr. Yidon is the Michael Jordan of virology.
[15:13.760 --> 15:21.280]  He's in the top 10 virologists worldwide on record and he's in the top two for respiratory
[15:21.280 --> 15:22.280]  viruses.
[15:22.280 --> 15:26.280]  So don't listen to Michael Jordan if he tells you how to play basketball and don't listen
[15:26.280 --> 15:32.240]  to Dr. Yidon when he tells you they're murdering you, murdering you, murder.
[15:32.240 --> 15:33.720]  Maybe folks won't listen to me if I call it murder.
[15:33.720 --> 15:39.160]  I go, red rum, red rum, red rum, red rum, murder backwards.
[15:39.160 --> 15:40.160]  Listen to game, folks.
[15:40.160 --> 15:42.320]  I know it's scary, but you've got to admit it.
[15:42.320 --> 15:44.040]  Bill Gates is depopulating us.
[15:44.040 --> 15:47.040]  He is murdering us.
[15:47.040 --> 15:48.040]  And it gets worse.
[15:48.040 --> 15:51.560]  We now know they're implanting prions in us that can hit with certain 5G wavelengths
[15:51.560 --> 15:53.200]  to activate them and grow them.
[15:53.200 --> 15:54.200]  They're a binary weapon.
[15:54.200 --> 15:59.680]  We'll be right back.
[15:59.680 --> 16:03.640]  It's the end of World War II, the globalists have been building their private corporate
[16:03.640 --> 16:08.680]  world government whose end game, once they get control, is forced depopulation of the
[16:08.680 --> 16:09.680]  planet.
[16:09.680 --> 16:14.440]  That's why as we begin to leave the year 2021 and go into 2022, I am encouraging all of
[16:14.440 --> 16:18.560]  you out there watching and listening to count the cost and to realize how much danger you
[16:18.560 --> 16:20.080]  and your family are in.
[16:20.080 --> 16:22.200]  The globalists are coming after everybody.
[16:22.200 --> 16:29.520]  They are setting up a dystopic planetary authoritarian technocracy, a dictatorship of the globalist.
[16:29.520 --> 16:31.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, info wars is the tip of the spear.
[16:31.880 --> 16:35.360]  Your investment in us over the years, buying our products, spreading the word and praying
[16:35.360 --> 16:36.360]  for us has been incredible.
[16:36.360 --> 16:40.560]  But I'm telling you right now, we're about to lose not just info wars, but the entire
[16:40.560 --> 16:42.440]  country and the world of tyranny.
[16:42.440 --> 16:46.000]  So now, everything you've done in the past needs to be redoubled today.
[16:46.000 --> 16:50.360]  And infowarstore.com is one of the most important places you can go to buy great products and
[16:50.360 --> 16:51.520]  fund the tip of the spear.
[16:51.520 --> 16:52.720]  I will go down with the ship.
[16:52.720 --> 16:53.800]  I'm not going to back down.
[16:53.800 --> 16:57.280]  I'm getting even more hardcore in their face, but I can't stay in the fight at 100% unless
[16:57.280 --> 16:59.640]  you support us, so please go to infowarstore.com.
[16:59.640 --> 17:07.840]  It's hard to believe that Christmas 2021 is here and soon will be in the year 2022.
[17:07.840 --> 17:17.400]  Everything the globalists plan on doing, their entire operations hinge on you psychologically,
[17:17.400 --> 17:22.920]  not understanding that they're trying to break your will, that they're trying to drive you
[17:22.920 --> 17:24.240]  into submission.
[17:24.240 --> 17:29.560]  But if you're aware of this basic fact and how they are scientifically controlling you,
[17:29.560 --> 17:32.520]  then you're basically immune.
[17:32.520 --> 17:37.000]  This is next level information on how to take control of your mind.
[17:37.000 --> 17:40.920]  It's how I've been able to stand against the incredible attacks they've carried out, because
[17:40.920 --> 17:43.400]  I'm able to connect to the divine.
[17:43.400 --> 17:48.960]  I'm able to transcend this dimension simply by becoming aware of the fact that I already
[17:48.960 --> 17:49.960]  transcended it.
[17:49.960 --> 17:57.160]  So, until Christmas day, we're offering ResetWars an incredible two-part course for 25% off
[17:57.160 --> 17:59.160]  at resetwars.com.
[17:59.160 --> 18:03.720]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in InfoWars live products, and that's
[18:03.720 --> 18:07.160]  why for more than two years we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth.
[18:07.160 --> 18:12.160]  And we could never get the ingredients again until now, and we have reformulated and not
[18:12.160 --> 18:16.720]  just used the same ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[18:16.720 --> 18:20.560]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level.
[18:20.560 --> 18:21.880]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[18:21.880 --> 18:26.920]  Cutting-edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[18:26.920 --> 18:31.840]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder, and
[18:31.840 --> 18:36.440]  a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbocharge your body with antioxidants.
[18:36.440 --> 18:39.840]  And then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium, and sodium
[18:39.840 --> 18:40.840]  added.
[18:40.840 --> 18:43.040]  I mean, this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[18:43.040 --> 18:47.480]  It's got real organic cocoa butter powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch
[18:47.480 --> 18:48.480]  of sea salt.
[18:48.480 --> 18:49.480]  And it just goes on and on.
[18:49.480 --> 18:55.280]  It is now back in stock, Ultimate Bone Broth Plus, available at 20% off and free shipping
[18:55.280 --> 19:00.400]  out of the gates at InfoWarsStore.com.
[19:00.400 --> 19:04.280]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul.
[19:04.280 --> 19:09.880]  I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet, I've had a lot of loss like everybody else
[19:09.880 --> 19:10.880]  has.
[19:10.880 --> 19:20.560]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died
[19:20.560 --> 19:24.280]  and bled and sweat for.
[19:24.280 --> 19:26.280]  And now we're just throwing it all away.
[19:26.280 --> 19:32.280]  And I see the general public, ENA, medically induced, scientifically induced, behavioral
[19:32.280 --> 19:35.280]  psychologically controlled, tranty.
[19:35.280 --> 19:41.120]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist maker under and it's so incredibly sad.
[19:41.120 --> 19:48.240]  But this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating
[19:48.240 --> 19:51.040]  and collapsing and then coming back to life again.
[19:51.040 --> 19:56.160]  It's just the globalists are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence
[19:56.160 --> 20:02.040]  and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[20:02.040 --> 20:13.480]  Taking a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:13.480 --> 20:27.200]  So welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this December 23rd, Thursday broadcast.
[20:27.200 --> 20:33.040]  There are literally hundreds of studies I've read more than 10 of them last year or so
[20:33.040 --> 20:38.160]  on the spike protein created by the Pfizer, Moderna, J&J, AstraZeneca injections, and
[20:38.160 --> 20:46.240]  now the new Pentagon system that admittedly quote uses nanotech, that it goes in and breaks
[20:46.240 --> 20:51.960]  the double helix of the DNA at the cellular level, which does one of two things, kills
[20:51.960 --> 20:55.240]  the cell or causes cancer.
[20:55.240 --> 21:00.120]  And I just played you Dr. Michael Yedon, the former chief scientist advisor over their
[21:00.120 --> 21:01.120]  vaccine program.
[21:01.120 --> 21:08.640]  But he was chief scientist, not the politician, not the banker, the guy actually running stuff
[21:08.640 --> 21:11.080]  saying he sees no other way than they're trying to kill you.
[21:11.080 --> 21:17.560]  And if you go read what he and Wolfgang Lüdard on December 1st of last year, now over a year
[21:17.560 --> 21:25.520]  ago, put an emergency injunction lawsuit in with hundreds of pages of addendums and studies
[21:25.520 --> 21:31.080]  and links saying it's going to cause attacks on the ovaries, attacks on the uterus, attacks
[21:31.080 --> 21:35.480]  on the heart, attacks on the arteries, attacks on the brain, attacks on the lungs.
[21:35.480 --> 21:36.760]  It's going to cause miscarriages.
[21:36.760 --> 21:41.560]  It's going to do all of this and it did every damn thing they said.
[21:41.560 --> 21:43.440]  This is real, folks.
[21:43.440 --> 21:48.800]  Imagine working at Facebook or YouTube or their parent company Google and Alphabet and
[21:48.800 --> 21:54.840]  Apple and all these groups and you're working there helping suppress this when it's a fact
[21:54.840 --> 21:56.960]  you've signed on to depopulation.
[21:56.960 --> 22:00.440]  It's a fact you're being made to take these shots yourselves.
[22:00.440 --> 22:02.360]  What are you going to do when you get the autoimmune disease?
[22:02.360 --> 22:07.400]  Well, as Dr. Yedon said, they'll claim it's some new virus or some new syndrome which
[22:07.400 --> 22:08.400]  they're already doing.
[22:08.400 --> 22:12.280]  They're going, oh, everybody's in the hospital dying because of Omnicron.
[22:12.280 --> 22:14.840]  They're having twice as many deaths this year than last.
[22:14.840 --> 22:16.360]  The hospitals are really full this time.
[22:16.360 --> 22:20.040]  They weren't last year because of, and then people go, wait, Omnicron's like a cold.
[22:20.040 --> 22:21.360]  You don't even die from it.
[22:21.360 --> 22:23.280]  Almost basically no one.
[22:23.280 --> 22:30.280]  In fact, all the deaths are again, Carrex, you know, just so, oh, he died of Omnicron.
[22:30.280 --> 22:39.480]  Omicron, however the hell you want to say it, but that's where we are.
[22:39.480 --> 22:44.520]  And there he is saying there's no doubt this is depopulation.
[22:44.520 --> 22:50.920]  He says these top off vaccines are, so they call them in the UK, boosters will make it
[22:50.920 --> 22:51.920]  worse.
[22:51.920 --> 22:52.920]  And you know what?
[22:52.920 --> 22:53.920]  People are hedging their bets now.
[22:53.920 --> 22:55.400]  Thank God.
[22:55.400 --> 23:00.320]  I have mainstream news all over the world.
[23:00.320 --> 23:03.320]  Let me just show you a few of these.
[23:03.320 --> 23:07.160]  Mainstream news saying, hey, we better not give these to young people.
[23:07.160 --> 23:11.240]  A, they don't get sick from the stuff, and B, it's causing heart attacks and massive
[23:11.240 --> 23:15.600]  numbers and other horrible, quote, adverse reactions.
[23:15.600 --> 23:18.240]  Here's the Wall Street Journal.
[23:18.240 --> 23:24.880]  The dangerous place to give boosters to teens, that's two days ago.
[23:24.880 --> 23:34.480]  Why do you think they had to have a CDC panel resign and an FDA panel resign because the
[23:34.480 --> 23:42.240]  majority would not sign on a year ago to this emergency garbage and then six months ago
[23:42.240 --> 23:46.800]  for five-year-olds and up, remember, remember?
[23:46.800 --> 23:49.960]  And then they get board members that don't even know what they're doing that are so disconnected
[23:49.960 --> 23:53.320]  like, yeah, we haven't tested this, we got to just give it to kids and see what it does.
[23:53.320 --> 23:58.440]  Remember that clip of an FDA board member, the new guy they put on?
[23:58.440 --> 24:01.720]  So, see, they don't even know they're being set up.
[24:01.720 --> 24:02.720]  The government's being set up.
[24:02.720 --> 24:06.720]  And I'm not defending the government, bunch of horrible criminals at the top of it, but
[24:06.720 --> 24:10.680]  I've war-gamed every angle of this, and then I even find global documents admitting it
[24:10.680 --> 24:13.120]  after I've war-gamed because you can just see what they're doing.
[24:13.120 --> 24:14.800]  This is going to bring down civilization.
[24:14.800 --> 24:17.320]  This is going to destroy trust.
[24:17.320 --> 24:24.440]  Tedris, the Marxist-Leninist Chinese communist agent on record who suppressed cholera in
[24:24.440 --> 24:28.880]  his own country and helped kill a million people and stole the money a decade ago that
[24:28.880 --> 24:33.600]  would have helped him in North Africa.
[24:33.600 --> 24:39.600]  Well, this guy, like, we'll play that clip in a moment.
[24:39.600 --> 24:40.600]  This is unedited, folks.
[24:40.600 --> 24:41.600]  This is real.
[24:41.600 --> 24:42.600]  This is right off the UN website.
[24:42.600 --> 24:43.600]  I went and checked it.
[24:43.600 --> 24:50.360]  Said, we need to be giving shots to adults, not to children, to kill them.
[24:50.360 --> 24:54.840]  See, he lives in the UN world where they're putting stuff in vaccines for decades to kill
[24:54.840 --> 24:57.600]  kids and putting stuff in tetanus shots to make women have miscarriages.
[24:57.600 --> 25:01.960]  I mean, damn, it's just like talking about, yeah, there's too many chickens, we need
[25:01.960 --> 25:06.760]  to butcher some of them, or, yeah, we've got too many cows on the back 100 acre.
[25:06.760 --> 25:07.760]  They're overgrazing.
[25:07.760 --> 25:10.520]  Go ahead and kill 20 of them.
[25:10.520 --> 25:15.200]  They just throw it out there like the FDA board member who goes, well, we just don't
[25:15.200 --> 25:16.200]  know what it'll do.
[25:16.200 --> 25:21.360]  We're going to get him to pick the kids.
[25:21.360 --> 25:23.960]  Here's the head of the WHO just throwing your face.
[25:23.960 --> 25:24.960]  Here it is.
[25:24.960 --> 25:31.120]  So, if it's going to be used, it's better to focus on those groups who have risk of
[25:31.120 --> 25:36.720]  severe disease and death, rather than, as we see, some countries are using to give boosters
[25:36.720 --> 25:40.920]  to children, which is not right.
[25:40.920 --> 25:45.160]  Give boosters to children, which is not the right.
[25:45.160 --> 25:48.400]  By the way, guys, I shot a video last night that's on M4 Wars where we loop it.
[25:48.400 --> 25:51.360]  You grab that for the next segment, because I also want to play the FDA board member
[25:51.360 --> 25:53.320]  saying similar crap.
[25:53.320 --> 25:58.520]  So, folks, they're all hedging their bets.
[25:58.520 --> 26:01.080]  Medical journals everywhere saying, hey, you better not do this.
[26:01.080 --> 26:02.080]  Hey, this is bad.
[26:02.080 --> 26:03.080]  Hey, read the fine print.
[26:03.080 --> 26:08.680]  Hey, remember the first six, seven months of the roll out of the injections?
[26:08.680 --> 26:12.360]  The DNA breaking nanotech poison?
[26:12.360 --> 26:13.440]  It's artificial viruses.
[26:13.440 --> 26:15.720]  It's synthetic viruses.
[26:15.720 --> 26:17.440]  Remember what they said.
[26:17.440 --> 26:21.600]  Remember what they said carefully.
[26:21.600 --> 26:28.880]  And think about what they said when they rolled it out.
[26:28.880 --> 26:32.920]  And what is it that they said when they rolled it out?
[26:32.920 --> 26:35.280]  They said nothing.
[26:35.280 --> 26:37.560]  Blank white sheets of paper.
[26:37.560 --> 26:41.160]  And the pharmacist, you know, by law, you're supposed to have adverse reactions to studies,
[26:41.160 --> 26:44.800]  the approval, the whole history of it, it's like that thin Bible paper, opens up to about
[26:44.800 --> 26:47.480]  what?
[26:47.480 --> 26:50.240]  Two foot by four foot, usually.
[26:50.240 --> 26:55.760]  I've seen some that are two by one, but usually they're two by three, two feet wide, three
[26:55.760 --> 26:56.760]  feet long.
[26:56.760 --> 27:00.280]  You've got to get a magnifying glass, even if you've got good eyes, to read it.
[27:00.280 --> 27:01.680]  And it's all right there.
[27:01.680 --> 27:08.080]  These were blank as the driven snow until about five months ago.
[27:08.080 --> 27:09.400]  And what did they start adding?
[27:09.400 --> 27:15.160]  Oh, heart attacks, microcarditis, blood clots, oh, oh, we told you.
[27:15.160 --> 27:16.160]  We told you.
[27:16.160 --> 27:19.840]  Oh, all over the news, safe and effective, never one problem.
[27:19.840 --> 27:20.840]  Everything's great.
[27:20.840 --> 27:21.840]  Everything's wonderful.
[27:21.840 --> 27:26.560]  And then you go to a Walgreens, you go to a Walmart or a CVS where they give these things
[27:26.560 --> 27:30.760]  and you ask the pharmacist, hey, give me the insert by law.
[27:30.760 --> 27:32.880]  They're supposed to give it to you.
[27:32.880 --> 27:36.520]  Every little ampule container of it comes with one and you can read it.
[27:36.520 --> 27:40.800]  And now it says heart attack, death, all that stuff, pancreatitis, it's got a big list of
[27:40.800 --> 27:41.800]  them.
[27:41.800 --> 27:42.800]  It's like, here's the bad stuff it does.
[27:42.800 --> 27:43.800]  We told you.
[27:43.800 --> 27:45.840]  Read the fine print, dumbass.
[27:45.840 --> 27:48.600]  That's their attitude, folks.
[27:48.600 --> 27:50.680]  And they know adults might read the fine print.
[27:50.680 --> 27:53.200]  That's why they want to get rid of the age of parental consent.
[27:53.200 --> 27:57.320]  So seven-year-olds in Europe are now being given the injection without parental consent
[27:57.320 --> 27:59.120]  and now they're announcing the same thing here.
[27:59.120 --> 28:02.320]  Because a seven-year-old doesn't read fine print, do they?
[28:02.320 --> 28:04.760]  Hell, adults don't read fine print.
[28:04.760 --> 28:07.280]  But you know who does read the fine print?
[28:07.280 --> 28:10.000]  Alexander Jones, baby.
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.400]  I do read the fine print.
[28:12.400 --> 28:19.360]  The fine print says we are killing your ass.
[28:19.360 --> 28:23.240]  By the way, they wonder all over the country they keep finding all these big supplies of
[28:23.240 --> 28:25.240]  unused so-called vaccine.
[28:25.240 --> 28:27.560]  It's because the pharmacists see their patients getting sick.
[28:27.560 --> 28:30.800]  At first they were giving it and then suddenly about a month then they stopped and they found
[28:30.800 --> 28:35.080]  around half the people in the country didn't get the vaccine because the pharmacists are
[28:35.080 --> 28:37.960]  taking matters with their own hands and they're flushing it down the fricking toilet and they're
[28:37.960 --> 28:39.720]  giving you saline.
[28:39.720 --> 28:42.960]  And that's how we're going to beat these people is all of us as the humans saying no to the
[28:42.960 --> 28:46.520]  new world order and no to this satanic attack.
[28:46.520 --> 28:49.760]  That's why they want robots to administer it all so they know it's actually being done.
[28:49.760 --> 28:55.120]  The pharmacists across the western world are saving millions right now and God bless them.
[28:55.120 --> 28:59.680]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[28:59.680 --> 29:03.000]  Not just across the United States but across the world.
[29:03.000 --> 29:07.000]  You see it on the sides of barns and on bumper stickers, on cars and written on the side
[29:07.000 --> 29:10.080]  of bathroom walls, Alex Jones was right.
[29:10.080 --> 29:14.600]  That's become a maxim of people to communicate to others that they see through the fraud
[29:14.600 --> 29:18.040]  of the new world order, that they're saying no to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gay and the Great
[29:18.040 --> 29:19.040]  Reset.
[29:19.040 --> 29:23.480]  And so now InfoWars credibility is stronger than it's ever been and the globalists are
[29:23.480 --> 29:27.480]  now coming to try to shut us down after all their other attacks and we can't let them
[29:27.480 --> 29:28.480]  do that.
[29:28.480 --> 29:30.800]  So you've invested in InfoWars over the years.
[29:30.800 --> 29:35.440]  I'm asking you to redouble those efforts now at this critical juncture or everything you've
[29:35.440 --> 29:38.120]  done in the past is for nothing.
[29:38.120 --> 29:42.040]  You have invested in justice and the truth and hardcore populace.
[29:42.040 --> 29:48.080]  You have done incredible things and I'm telling you now, going into 2022, InfoWars has major
[29:48.080 --> 29:51.440]  underages to run our operation and we need more funds in.
[29:51.440 --> 29:55.360]  So it's a 360 win, get great products that are great for you and your family, your immune
[29:55.360 --> 29:56.600]  system and so much more.

[31:15.320 --> 31:18.960]  in my definitions and my way of seeing the world.
[31:18.960 --> 31:20.400]  Doesn't mean it's perfectly right.
[31:20.400 --> 31:24.280]  As the Bible says, we all see through a rose color darkly, but we've proven that we've
[31:24.280 --> 31:29.160]  got some of the clearest cutting edge discernment out there.

[32:03.440 --> 32:07.560]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the Communists?
[32:07.560 --> 32:12.880]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[32:12.880 --> 32:16.640]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee and yeah, we buy it from the little
[32:16.640 --> 32:20.560]  farmers that, you know, the media calls Communists, but really they're just a commune and whatever
[32:20.560 --> 32:24.160]  the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't want the
[32:24.160 --> 32:27.280]  Mexican government to take over so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've
[32:27.280 --> 32:29.800]  been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[32:29.800 --> 32:34.520]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound and I just
[32:34.520 --> 32:36.680]  think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere.
[32:36.680 --> 32:40.680]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[32:40.680 --> 32:47.680]  In fact, I'm not gonna tell you a little story, um, yeah, I'd like to, okay, you wouldn't
[32:47.680 --> 32:48.680]  believe it.
[32:48.680 --> 32:53.440]  So, it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't find
[32:53.440 --> 33:01.240]  us and don't want to see it, that's fine.
[33:01.240 --> 33:14.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:14.240 --> 33:26.800]  Here is the director of the United Nations WHO admitting that vaccines of this type of
[33:26.800 --> 33:31.360]  mRNA to the children are killing them, but that's the agenda.
[33:31.360 --> 33:36.920]  You're about to see two videos which are extremely thought provoking.
[33:36.920 --> 33:40.520]  Each clip has been documented and proven to be accurate.
[33:40.520 --> 33:42.760]  They're not denying they said this.
[33:42.760 --> 33:48.120]  The first clip is the head of the World Health Organization saying that countries are using
[33:48.120 --> 33:50.600]  vaccines to kill children.
[33:50.600 --> 33:56.520]  Another is a member of the federal government regulatory board in the U.S. saying we have
[33:56.520 --> 34:02.760]  a tested the COVID-19 vaccines on children, so now we're just gonna give it to them to
[34:02.760 --> 34:04.320]  see what happens.
[34:04.320 --> 34:08.200]  Here are both clips back to back for you to watch.
[34:08.200 --> 34:14.400]  So if it's going to be used, it's better to focus on those groups who have risk of severe
[34:14.400 --> 34:19.680]  disease and death, rather than as we see, some countries are using to give boosters
[34:19.680 --> 34:27.720]  to kill children, to kill children, to kill children, to kill children, which is not right.
[34:27.720 --> 34:32.480]  But we're never going to learn about how safe the vaccine is unless you start giving it.
[34:32.480 --> 34:38.480]  That's just the way it goes.
[34:38.480 --> 34:40.240]  We're never going to learn what they really do to give them to the children and now that
[34:40.240 --> 34:45.720]  we know the FDA a year ago was suppressing that when they started the shots it was causing
[34:45.720 --> 34:50.480]  mass death and new documents came out today under court order confirming thousands of
[34:50.480 --> 34:51.480]  more deaths.
[34:51.480 --> 34:52.480]  I'm going to get to those.
[34:52.480 --> 34:56.680]  We now understand this is premeditated murder.
[34:56.680 --> 35:00.760]  Just like they designed it with the spike protein, the one thing that will go in and
[35:00.760 --> 35:05.360]  destroy the double helix of the DNA because they know your body will repair itself when
[35:05.360 --> 35:06.360]  it's attacked.
[35:06.360 --> 35:09.760]  This attacks the repair mechanism.
[35:09.760 --> 35:15.240]  It's equivalent of the reactor shaft on the Death Star, the one spot to hit us.
[35:15.240 --> 35:20.720]  And then everything unravels and you die from 100 different things as Dr. Michael Yedon,
[35:20.720 --> 35:26.040]  former chief scientist who just retired three years ago, told you in the earlier video.
[35:26.040 --> 35:30.440]  Now something just hit me while I was talking last segment that I already knew and we already
[35:30.440 --> 35:33.240]  talked about and I know you know this.
[35:33.240 --> 35:38.520]  But listen to me very carefully, please, on my knees, metaphysically I'm on my knees.
[35:38.520 --> 35:40.600]  I'm asking you to listen to me.
[35:40.600 --> 35:44.240]  If you understand this, you understand everything.
[35:44.240 --> 35:46.520]  It's a rosetta stone or what I call a skeleton key.
[35:46.520 --> 35:47.880]  It opens every door.
[35:47.880 --> 35:56.280]  If you understand what I'm about to say and you explain it to other people, there's no
[35:56.280 --> 35:57.640]  way to debate this.
[35:57.640 --> 36:01.960]  Because you can show them the science and the studies that it makes you sicker and erases
[36:01.960 --> 36:05.360]  your immune system and turns off your killer T's and all that.
[36:05.360 --> 36:10.520]  People are like, okay, but when you explain to them, hey, do you notice that you used
[36:10.520 --> 36:15.360]  to get your vaccines at your doctor, like a tetanus shot or whatever most of the time?
[36:15.360 --> 36:19.240]  Did you notice you can't get them from your doctor?
[36:19.240 --> 36:21.600]  Did you notice you can't get them from your hospital?
[36:21.600 --> 36:25.080]  Because see, the globalists own those big hospital chains.
[36:25.080 --> 36:27.560]  They don't want them caught up in this.
[36:27.560 --> 36:34.120]  It's done through big state sponsors, city sponsored events out at sports stadiums and
[36:34.120 --> 36:41.080]  at church parking lots so that you don't have somebody to blame in a month or a week or
[36:41.080 --> 36:44.680]  a year when you die of a stroke or you have a heart attack or you get cancer.
[36:44.680 --> 36:48.760]  You go back to that airport hangar and there's nobody there or there's people's airplanes
[36:48.760 --> 36:52.560]  there and the gates are locked and a security guard comes up and says, I don't know what
[36:52.560 --> 36:54.800]  you're talking about because they don't.
[36:54.800 --> 36:56.320]  Plausible deniability.
[36:56.320 --> 37:02.440]  They shoot you with a DNA double helix killing weapon.
[37:02.440 --> 37:03.920]  You crawl off and slowly die.
[37:03.920 --> 37:07.120]  Your family spends all the money they got trying to save you going right back to the
[37:07.120 --> 37:11.680]  same hospital systems and right back to the same big pharma that's been given liability
[37:11.680 --> 37:12.800]  protection.
[37:12.800 --> 37:16.320]  But the big pharma at the top has been given liability protection.
[37:16.320 --> 37:21.000]  It doesn't want its other divisions and arms of its big hospital groups and other things
[37:21.000 --> 37:28.200]  getting in trouble show it does these big clinics but then CVS, Wal-Mart, Walgreens,
[37:28.200 --> 37:33.000]  part of InfraGuard, part of the secret Pfizer agreement umbrella that's now come out there
[37:33.000 --> 37:36.360]  under, they were given liability protection.
[37:36.360 --> 37:41.560]  And so it's in that one place where, imagine, listen to me carefully, you're a pharmacist,
[37:41.560 --> 37:45.360]  you know the people that you come to you a lot, you know especially small town ones
[37:45.360 --> 37:50.400]  but you notice people come in, they get the shot, maybe you gave 50 shots that day and
[37:50.400 --> 37:55.360]  you notice the next couple weeks you get heart attack medication, you hear a patient died,
[37:55.360 --> 37:59.280]  you know you hear one of your customers died, you know suddenly they're really sick, they're
[37:59.280 --> 38:04.080]  their brother or mother or son or daughter comes to the thing and says, yeah Sandy or
[38:04.080 --> 38:10.680]  yeah Bob, yeah mom died or yeah mom is in a coma or mom had a blood clot and you're
[38:10.680 --> 38:15.280]  sitting there looking at your patients, looking at your customers, looking at people you take
[38:15.280 --> 38:19.960]  care of and you're noticing a bunch of them are sick and dead.
[38:19.960 --> 38:24.240]  That's why they didn't want doctors administering it and that's why there's no doctors in the
[38:24.240 --> 38:29.080]  United States, no private medical clinics giving it.
[38:29.080 --> 38:34.520]  This has all been preplanned from the beginning by lawyers and actuaries that study and war
[38:34.520 --> 38:37.880]  game every facet of this.
[38:37.880 --> 38:41.040]  And by the way this is all admitted, so let's put up the headlines for folks, remember that
[38:41.040 --> 38:46.960]  came out two weeks ago, that why aren't refugees getting shots, well the UN and the refugee
[38:46.960 --> 38:54.800]  groups don't want the liability, COVID vaccine manufacturers worried refugees could sue them
[38:54.800 --> 39:00.280]  following adverse reactions.
[39:00.280 --> 39:06.640]  So that's where we are ladies and gentlemen, it's done in select areas, it's done in neutral
[39:06.640 --> 39:13.240]  third party sites because nobody wants a bunch of people killed in their backyard, nobody
[39:13.240 --> 39:17.840]  wants to be connected to this, they want to have a bunch of layers of insulation of your
[39:17.840 --> 39:23.400]  local government, of your state government, of your federal government, of the UN international
[39:23.400 --> 39:30.680]  government, all the liability protection with big pharma at the top carrying all this down.
[39:30.680 --> 39:36.640]  Because if you had doctors that run a family practice like my dad and they see their patients
[39:36.640 --> 39:44.840]  come in like Dr. Zelinko and they see in Zelinko's case he has 30,000 patients, sounds
[39:44.840 --> 39:50.360]  like a lot my dad had over 10,000 patients just himself in dentistry and you see them
[39:50.360 --> 39:53.480]  get the shot because Zelinko wasn't giving it to some of his patients, they were going
[39:53.480 --> 39:57.760]  getting other places and you see the adverse reaction, you see the bad problem, you know
[39:57.760 --> 40:01.720]  you're like my god I've never seen many of my patients this sick, what are the big doctors
[40:01.720 --> 40:07.560]  there's a bunch of in Europe and here, the head of the German epidemiology national pathology
[40:07.560 --> 40:15.320]  union, pathology union, not epidemiology pathology union, he said we've seen a 20 fold increase
[40:15.320 --> 40:20.880]  in cancers, a double fold in heart attacks, same numbers out of Scotland, same numbers
[40:20.880 --> 40:24.320]  out of Ireland, same numbers out of Canada, same numbers out of the US, same numbers out
[40:24.320 --> 40:29.840]  of Germany and Spain, a doubling of heart attacks and microcarditis at least, 20 fold
[40:29.840 --> 40:34.840]  increase in cancer and then what are these doctors that own these big biopsy companies
[40:34.840 --> 40:42.200]  come out and say, what did they say they saw going back almost a year, the same thing the
[40:42.200 --> 40:53.080]  head German scientist said, we're seeing a 20 plus fold increase in rare cancers in the
[40:53.080 --> 40:58.280]  biopsies, these are doctors that own biopsy labs, there's a bunch of them on public, we
[40:58.280 --> 41:04.840]  played the clubs many times and they bring their findings in the UK, in Canada, in the
[41:04.840 --> 41:09.600]  US, in three cases we've covered and they don't even want to talk to them, normally
[41:09.600 --> 41:15.520]  a major biopsy firm, a major laboratory calls the state government or the federal government,
[41:15.520 --> 41:19.280]  they're there in days, sometimes hours, like what are you finding, is there something going
[41:19.280 --> 41:24.640]  on, oh no, no, no, no, yeah if there's a chemical spill and then they find the towns all getting
[41:24.640 --> 41:28.440]  sick, they say oh my god, some toxins got in the water and they tell people, they're not
[41:28.440 --> 41:34.000]  telling you and the scientists and doctors are going to them and saying this is happening,
[41:34.000 --> 41:40.600]  we're worried and they're being told it doesn't matter, shut up.
[41:40.600 --> 41:48.040]  What did that big undertaker, runs a big funeral home in England say, what did he say, he said
[41:48.040 --> 41:58.480]  we're seeing a 20 plus times, he said I've seen way more people sick from heart attacks
[41:58.480 --> 42:04.960]  and blood clots than all my years as a coroner and he said again, it's about a 20 time increase
[42:04.960 --> 42:12.520]  in one year, one year, pathologists, coroners, scientists, lab owners, these are research
[42:12.520 --> 42:18.600]  scientists in Germany, in the US, in Canada, in the UK, the Japanese are like, we're not
[42:18.600 --> 42:22.560]  taking it, they're less than 20% injected, they're like don't be mean to people, we're
[42:22.560 --> 42:27.360]  not taking it, we're not taking it, we're not taking it, we're not taking it, we're not
[42:27.360 --> 42:36.000]  stupid, 6% of South Africa is taking it, they're not stupid, they've been experiencing UN love
[42:36.000 --> 42:43.880]  for a long time, we're just now getting some UN love, you like it, I don't, Dr. Zelenko
[42:43.880 --> 42:48.320]  is coming up, we have that amazing young lady in the viral anti-Trump video, she's
[42:48.320 --> 42:59.160]  joining us and that's all coming up here, ladies and gentlemen, big broadcast today.
[42:59.160 --> 43:03.120]  Since the end of World War II, the globalists have been building their private corporate
[43:03.120 --> 43:08.200]  world government, whose end game, once they get control, is forced depopulation of the
[43:08.200 --> 43:13.560]  planet, that's why as we begin to leave the year 2021 and go into 2022, I am encouraging
[43:13.560 --> 43:17.280]  all of you out there watching and listening to count the cost and to realize how much
[43:17.280 --> 43:22.160]  danger you and your family are in, the globalists are coming after everybody, they are setting
[43:22.160 --> 43:29.160]  up a dystopic planetary authoritarian technocracy, a dictatorship of the globalist, ladies and
[43:29.160 --> 43:32.840]  gentlemen, in full wars is the tip of the spear, your investment in us over the years

[43:59.000 --> 44:04.040]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava Roots supplement that
[44:04.040 --> 44:09.880]  is now available at infowarstore.com, Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in
[44:09.880 --> 44:14.360]  the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific
[44:14.360 --> 44:20.240]  Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects, according to ancient Samoan legend Kava was
[44:20.240 --> 44:26.280]  given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and
[44:26.280 --> 44:31.200]  creator of the universe. The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings
[44:31.200 --> 44:36.200]  and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little. Nowadays Kava is used around the world by
[44:36.200 --> 44:41.800]  many who enjoy its serious benefits. The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains
[44:41.800 --> 44:47.680]  a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other herbs including but not limited to, German
[44:47.680 --> 44:53.560]  Kama Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and Balarian Root. We do expect to sell this new product
[44:53.560 --> 44:58.560]  quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting infowarstore.com.
[44:58.560 --> 45:05.440]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure
[45:05.440 --> 45:09.040]  what's happening in the atmosphere, but if you look at all the different studies and
[45:09.040 --> 45:13.680]  reports about my NASA and other governments and other agencies, they all disagree on what's
[45:13.680 --> 45:19.480]  really happening with the climate. The only constant, the only great truth is change is
[45:19.480 --> 45:24.760]  the only constant. So yes, climate change is totally real, but notice first they called
[45:24.760 --> 45:28.480]  it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s, and then it's going to be global warming,
[45:28.480 --> 45:31.720]  and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to, okay, now it's just climate
[45:31.720 --> 45:37.840]  change. But did you know that man-made climate change is a real thing when it comes to the
[45:37.840 --> 45:43.000]  United Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN? They have. Weather
[45:43.000 --> 45:48.120]  control trees from 1979, and Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long
[45:48.120 --> 45:52.840]  time. In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying
[45:52.840 --> 45:56.920]  different particles out of jet engines to control the weather. So yes, man-made climate
[45:56.920 --> 46:04.160]  change is real. It's hard to believe that Christmas 2021 is here, and soon will be in
[46:04.160 --> 46:14.400]  the year 2022. Everything the globalists plan on doing, their entire operations hinge
[46:14.400 --> 46:19.920]  on you psychologically, not understanding that they're trying to break your will, that
[46:19.920 --> 46:25.840]  they're trying to drive you into submission. But if you're aware of this basic fact and
[46:25.840 --> 46:32.800]  how they are scientifically controlling you, then you're basically immune. This is next
[46:32.800 --> 46:37.560]  level information on how to take control of your mind. It's how I've been able to stand
[46:37.560 --> 46:42.720]  against the incredible attacks they carried out, because I'm able to connect to the divine.
[46:42.720 --> 46:48.280]  I'm able to transcend this dimension simply by becoming aware of the fact that I already
[46:48.280 --> 46:54.520]  transcended it. So until Christmas Day, we're offering Reset Wars our incredible two-part
[46:54.520 --> 47:01.360]  course for 25% off at resetwars.com.
[47:01.360 --> 47:20.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:20.840 --> 47:27.560]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[47:27.560 --> 47:38.920]  the Info War. When do you get the flag? When do they shoot at you? When you're over the
[47:38.920 --> 47:49.800]  target. Where do you want to be? Over the target. And that's a paradox. I don't want
[47:49.800 --> 47:55.480]  to be in the flag. I don't want to be getting shot at, but I got to be over the target.
[47:55.480 --> 48:02.280]  I got to drop my bombs, the truth. I got to destroy the enemy. And when I say that,
[48:02.280 --> 48:06.600]  obviously I don't mean drop real bombs on these people. They've got Civil War, they're
[48:06.600 --> 48:10.280]  planning to start, they've got their whole martial law plan. New information's come out
[48:10.280 --> 48:16.040]  on that, we'll cover it at Summit Dutters and Linko next hour. But I'm talking about
[48:16.040 --> 48:18.880]  what are they scared of. So let me cover a lot of different angles of this so people
[48:18.880 --> 48:24.560]  can get inside my brain, and hopefully you agree with me and take action on this. Here
[48:24.560 --> 48:29.000]  I am on air saying please buy products, please buy things at Info War Store, we have an underage
[48:29.000 --> 48:34.320]  in the next year, we need more money. And then I get on air and I say I'm going to
[48:34.320 --> 48:39.160]  pay out $5,000 prizes to everybody that can jump legally and lawfully, non-violently on
[48:39.160 --> 48:45.760]  national TV in a public place, and get out the message that these are not vaccines, they
[48:45.760 --> 48:51.880]  are GMO shots linked to mass death in the FDA documents, infowars.com. Something along
[48:51.880 --> 48:55.920]  those lines. And I want to pay it out. I want to do it, people say well you don't have
[48:55.920 --> 49:04.360]  enough money. I just sold my house to dump it all in here. The money's all for the war.
[49:04.360 --> 49:08.680]  That's the point is yeah, we don't have a lot of extra money, we're spending it in the
[49:08.680 --> 49:12.560]  most important places we've got like we did five years ago that helped bring down Hillary
[49:12.560 --> 49:16.560]  Clinton with Bill Clinton's Arrapa stuff. That's credit is bringing them down. They
[49:16.560 --> 49:22.120]  credited you, this operation, you taking the mission in stopping them, getting women to
[49:22.120 --> 49:27.440]  vote for Trump. And we know Trump was a lot better than Hillary. You know I got major
[49:27.440 --> 49:31.680]  problems with him now, the direction he's gone. Back then great. Now got a lot of problems,
[49:31.680 --> 49:41.720]  but whatever. When I say it's time at ball games and on C-span and on local TV shows
[49:41.720 --> 49:48.280]  and whatever, you see a live camera going in the street or somewhere legal and lawful,
[49:48.280 --> 49:51.720]  jump in front of it or try to get interviewed. That's even better if you can get them to
[49:51.720 --> 49:56.400]  interview you and talk about that. That's not just so infowars gets visitors. Infowars
[49:56.400 --> 50:01.360]  is a symbol of resistance they try to destroy. Or say Alex Jones is right, that's another
[50:01.360 --> 50:08.960]  symbol. Those are the only symbols we've got. What else can we say? Let's go Brandon. That
[50:08.960 --> 50:12.960]  just means F. Joe Biden. He's a puppet. He's meant to get the attacks. Sure it shows we're
[50:12.960 --> 50:17.280]  not buying his BS, but that's part of their plan. They don't want Klaus Schwab launched
[50:17.280 --> 50:23.840]  COVID-19, put him in prison, infowars.com. They don't want the real power structure
[50:23.840 --> 50:27.680]  being exposed. They want it to be their muppets, their minions. And yeah, there's the first
[50:27.680 --> 50:36.360]  video, six months for the election in 2016, where Tucker Carlson and crew, including the
[50:36.360 --> 50:43.040]  ambassador's daughter, who's called for my arrest on air, are up there and a guy jumps
[50:43.040 --> 50:52.280]  up and says, Bill Clinton's a rapist, infowars.com. That one guy doing that caused the chain reaction
[50:52.280 --> 50:57.400]  where it happened hundreds of times and changed the course of history. Now, let's talk about
[50:57.400 --> 51:04.920]  somebody changing the course of history, Jesse Waters. He says, now you go out with a kill
[51:04.920 --> 51:10.600]  shot, deadly because an ambush. He doesn't see it coming in the media. A kill shots like
[51:10.600 --> 51:19.440]  when do see in the hearings or in the press conferences always just nails them with, okay,
[51:19.440 --> 51:23.720]  we pay illegals to come here illegally, but we don't pay people to come here legally.
[51:23.720 --> 51:29.160]  That's a kill shot. It's a mic drop. It means a Michael Jordan flying through the air. You
[51:29.160 --> 51:34.800]  know, slam dunk. That's what a kill shot is. Doesn't mean go kill fouts. Yes, listen one.
[51:34.800 --> 51:40.120]  Now they're all the news. Oh, fire waters. Oh, Fox. They called for our God to be killed.
[51:40.120 --> 51:45.400]  No, he called in his full quote for the media to confront him everywhere at press conferences
[51:45.400 --> 51:49.240]  and call out that he cooked up the stuff at the lab. And then he tried to block treatments
[51:49.240 --> 51:54.240]  that save people and that he's invested and owns the spike protein HIV that's been put
[51:54.240 --> 52:00.480]  into the very virus. That's a GMO virus. He's so easy to take down. And what Waters is saying
[52:00.480 --> 52:09.320]  is the answer even better? Yes. Yes. Yes. I can't give bounties to other people's reporters,
[52:09.320 --> 52:16.840]  but the bounty is freedom. The bounty is you having a future. You know, I got an extra
[52:16.840 --> 52:20.320]  car. I'm selling it next week. I sold my house. I love it. It's the best thing in my life.
[52:20.320 --> 52:26.160]  I'm getting ready to sell an auction on air basically almost everything I've got because
[52:26.160 --> 52:31.200]  next year is everything I'm all in. That's not me losing the left celebrates. Oh, look,
[52:31.200 --> 52:34.040]  Jones says he's running out of money. Damn right. I'm running out of money. I'm like
[52:34.040 --> 52:40.520]  a giant booster about to get into orbit. I mean, we're winning. This is history. I'm
[52:40.520 --> 52:45.280]  ready to die for this. Of course, I'm going to expend everything I got because now is
[52:45.280 --> 52:54.760]  the final round. So he's absolutely right. We need kill shots everywhere, non violently
[52:54.760 --> 52:59.480]  kill shots where we nail them with the truth and show everywhere they go. We're aware of
[52:59.480 --> 53:02.480]  what they're doing. And you're going to be walking down the street in a small town. Big
[53:02.480 --> 53:06.000]  City doesn't matter. You think of the ways you do it. You don't care about the $5,000.
[53:06.000 --> 53:12.280]  I know that. And I'm going to cap it. They're explaining the finances. We don't have money.
[53:12.280 --> 53:17.440]  We're going to cap it at the first 30 that do it. And that's 5,000 times 30. So you do
[53:17.440 --> 53:21.840]  the math. And then sometimes it causes a chain reaction of us to get support. The more money
[53:21.840 --> 53:25.640]  comes in, we'll up the contest. But who cares about that? Maybe you just want to do it and
[53:25.640 --> 53:29.760]  tell us you don't want the 5,000. I don't care. The point is it's a little reward to
[53:29.760 --> 53:35.840]  make it more exciting. It's like buying you a meal after you win a boxing match or something.
[53:35.840 --> 53:40.840]  The point is this is war, people. And we need to get out there on the streets and take action.
[53:40.840 --> 53:44.280]  And you notice they are running around like chickens with their heads cut off, crapping
[53:44.280 --> 53:49.240]  themselves right now at the idea that instead of the leftist saying it's mostly peaceful
[53:49.240 --> 53:53.400]  to burn down buildings, and Chris Cuomo and all the pedophiles that run CNN calling for
[53:53.400 --> 53:58.000]  violence and saying the guy that shot Scalise was a hero as Wolf Blitzer's guest said, we're
[53:58.000 --> 54:01.040]  not calling for shooting people. We're not calling for breaking Rand Paul's ribs. We're
[54:01.040 --> 54:04.440]  not calling for hurting the cops. We're not calling for burning anything down. We're calling
[54:04.440 --> 54:12.320]  for burning your lives down peacefully with the kill shot with the info war. So this is
[54:12.320 --> 54:16.200]  what you need to see. You either want to be a slave and eject with liquid death. You want
[54:16.200 --> 54:24.440]  to be free, you do. Well, Jesse Waters is talking about this is the answer. And so yeah,
[54:24.440 --> 54:29.520]  I want you to go out there and I want you to get it out on national TV, national radio.
[54:29.520 --> 54:36.360]  I want you to get it out. In fact, even if you don't follow the contest fully and don't
[54:36.360 --> 54:42.120]  get the full kill shot politically, $1,000 for people that just try, I'll give out 20
[54:42.120 --> 54:48.680]  of those prizes. The point is our listeners literally put the globalist into a siege mentality
[54:48.680 --> 54:52.000]  where they launched COVID and locked everything down the rest of it just because they know
[54:52.000 --> 54:55.480]  they're rejected everywhere. Let's show it everywhere. It doesn't have to be a thing
[54:55.480 --> 55:01.840]  that Obama or Hillary or Fauci said it's every event. It's gardening shows. It's car shows.
[55:01.840 --> 55:07.560]  It's bass shows. It's anything on national TV. It's baseball games. It's football games.
[55:07.560 --> 55:12.280]  It's basketball games. It's hockey games. You can do it in New Zealand. You can do it
[55:12.280 --> 55:17.040]  in Australia. You can do it in Mexico. You can do it in Brazil. You can do it wherever
[55:17.040 --> 55:21.040]  the hell you're going to do it. Just do it and say where to where are you matters? And
[55:21.040 --> 55:27.160]  we know it's depopulation in full wars.com. Alex Jones is right. Because let me tell
[55:27.160 --> 55:30.280]  you something. Let me tell you that ain't about me being famous or getting credit.
[55:30.280 --> 55:36.480]  My John Hancock's gonna be all over that sucker because I'm already in this thing 110% instead
[55:36.480 --> 55:40.600]  of giving in to fear and backing down when I'm under a major attack. I've decided to
[55:40.600 --> 55:44.720]  go all out. So when I ask you to go out there and do this, you know, I'm pretty much signing
[55:44.720 --> 55:51.960]  my death warrant. Just have it be big and bold and neon for me. Okay. I want to be the symbol
[55:51.960 --> 55:55.560]  of the people. I want to be a symbol of somebody who doesn't back down. I want to be a symbol
[55:55.560 --> 55:59.320]  of somebody that stands up for the children because God's watching not because I'm a hero
[55:59.320 --> 56:03.760]  because it's my mission. And I've done all of this to get to this point. We've all done
[56:03.760 --> 56:09.600]  this together and we're not backing down and give in to these Satanists right now.
[56:09.600 --> 56:12.920]  You heard Dr. Zalinko when he was on last time. Info wars helped build the platform
[56:12.920 --> 56:17.640]  and the launch pad for everything we've done. So instead of Trump won banners, like some
[56:17.640 --> 56:23.080]  of our crew have done great people, it needs to be the vaccine kills. Vaccines poison info
[56:23.080 --> 56:29.640]  wars.com. But let's play what waters had to say. Here it is. Now you're going for the
[56:29.640 --> 56:38.440]  kill shot. The kill shot with an ambush deadly because he doesn't see it coming. This is when
[56:38.440 --> 56:50.320]  you say Dr. Fauci, you funded risky research at a sloppy Chinese lab, the same lab that
[56:50.320 --> 56:59.520]  sprung this pandemic on the world. You know why people don't trust you. Don't you? Boom.
[56:59.520 --> 57:11.720]  He is dead. Yeah. Son. Now how you do that 30 seconds. So you need 30 seconds. Now you
[57:11.720 --> 57:16.640]  get that footage to us. You get it to Fox. You get it to human events. You get it to
[57:16.640 --> 57:20.720]  bright bar. You get it to daily call or you get it to the turning point pipeline. Just
[57:20.720 --> 57:28.000]  don't mention enforce. Imagine Tucker Carlson teases out of the A block coming up. Brave
[57:28.000 --> 57:34.800]  college student confronts Lord Fauci at dinner. I love how they take all my terms for some
[57:34.800 --> 57:43.200]  footage, right? Fauci. Get us that. That's what we want. That changes the whole conversation
[57:43.200 --> 57:49.960]  of the country. Yep. Great point. We'll be right back. Stay with us. Not just across
[57:49.960 --> 57:54.520]  the United States, but across the world. You see it on the sides of barns and on bumper
[57:54.520 --> 58:00.160]  stickers on cars written on the side of bathroom walls. Alex Jones was right. That's become
[58:00.160 --> 58:04.600]  a maximum of people to communicate to others that they see through the fraud of the new
[58:04.600 --> 58:08.760]  world order that they're saying no to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates and the Great Reset. And
[58:08.760 --> 58:13.360]  so now in forward credibility is stronger than it's ever been. And the globalist are
[58:13.360 --> 58:17.360]  now coming to try to shut us down after all their other attacks. And we can't let them
[58:17.360 --> 58:22.160]  do that. So you've invested in four years over the years. I'm asking you to redouble
[58:22.160 --> 58:27.160]  those efforts now at this critical juncture or everything you've done in the past is for
[58:27.160 --> 58:32.160]  nothing. You have invested in justice and the truth and hardcore populace. You have
[58:32.160 --> 58:38.880]  done incredible things. And I'm telling you now, going into 2022, M4 Wars has major underages
[58:38.880 --> 58:43.520]  to run an operation and we need more funds in. So it's a 360 win. Get great products
[58:43.520 --> 58:46.720]  that are great for you and your family, your immune system and so much more. So please
[58:46.720 --> 58:55.160]  go to M4Wars.com. Get our great bag of it here. I mean, this is from, people say, why
[58:55.160 --> 58:59.720]  is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists? Well, that's where some of the best coffee
[58:59.720 --> 59:04.520]  in the world that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil, better than
[59:04.520 --> 59:08.280]  Guatemalan coffee. And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media
[59:08.280 --> 59:11.720]  calls communists, but really they're just a commune. And whatever the point is, is that
[59:11.720 --> 59:15.160]  it's good coffee and we've got it. And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take
[59:15.160 --> 59:18.600]  over. So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what, 14
[59:18.600 --> 59:21.680]  years and the price has never gone up. The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another
[59:21.680 --> 59:25.840]  name for about 50% more per pound. And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're
[59:25.840 --> 59:30.440]  going to find anywhere. It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[59:30.440 --> 59:38.160]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story. We had one. Okay, you wouldn't believe
[59:38.160 --> 59:43.400]  it. Anyway, so it's M4Wars.com. And that's how we fund this operation. And if you don't
[59:43.400 --> 59:50.400]  find us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[1:00:14.400 --> 1:00:21.680]  Jesse Peters is right. Fauci wants to give our children a kill shot, a physical attack.
[1:00:21.680 --> 1:00:25.280]  We want to give them a kill shot of truth, exposing that he ran the Wuhan Lab at Bill
[1:00:25.280 --> 1:00:31.080]  Gates. He launched the attack. He's the one behind it all. He's the one.
[1:00:31.080 --> 1:00:38.760]  Now you're going for the kill shot. The kill shot with an ambush, deadly. He doesn't see
[1:00:38.760 --> 1:00:49.120]  it coming. This is when you say, Dr. Fauci, you funded risky research at a sloppy Chinese
[1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:57.680]  lab, the same lab that sprung this pandemic on the world. You know why people don't trust
[1:00:57.680 --> 1:01:06.680]  you, don't you? Boom. He is dead. He is dead. He's done.
[1:01:06.680 --> 1:01:13.680]  Now you do that 30 seconds. That's all you need. 30 seconds. Now you get that footage
[1:01:14.120 --> 1:01:18.960]  to us. You get it to Fox. You get it to Human Events. You get it to Bright Bar. You get
[1:01:18.960 --> 1:01:21.320]  it to Daily Call. Or you get it to the Turning Point.
[1:01:21.320 --> 1:01:26.720]  You don't get it to M4Wars. Imagine Tucker Carlson teases out of the A-Block, coming
[1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:33.720]  up. Brave college student confronts Lord Fauci at dinner.
[1:01:33.720 --> 1:01:38.720]  Lord Fauci, I love it. Exclusive footage right back. Lord Biden.
[1:01:38.720 --> 1:01:45.720]  Get us that. That's what we want. That changes the whole conversation of the country.
[1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:53.720]  Have authorized it. Just make sure it's legal.
[1:01:53.720 --> 1:02:00.720]  You know, I really love watching everybody imitate what we do, because that's actually
[1:02:00.720 --> 1:02:03.960]  what people say. What do you like to call people Lord Fauci? Now they're doing it. They're
[1:02:03.960 --> 1:02:07.280]  saying go after the globalists. They're saying get in their face. We're all the same team.
[1:02:07.280 --> 1:02:11.480]  These are tactics. These are great facts. Send it to him. We've gotten plenty of credit
[1:02:11.480 --> 1:02:15.000]  for trying to kill me and put me in prison right now. All I want to do is win against
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:19.640]  these people. But here is the video before we even started the contest that had me happy.
[1:02:19.640 --> 1:02:23.760]  I did the contest five years ago. What I was saying, you ought to go confront them and say
[1:02:23.760 --> 1:02:29.600]  Bill Clinton's a rapist in FullWars.com. And this is the Tucker Carlson clip that caused
[1:02:29.600 --> 1:02:31.600]  the chamber to action.
[1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:34.880]  Waiting for this segment all morning long. We are rolling out the red carpet not for
[1:02:34.880 --> 1:02:40.880]  Tucker, but for some adorable, adoptable dogs every year. The Best Friends Animal Society
[1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:45.880]  helps cats and dogs who are stuck in animal shelters.
[1:02:45.880 --> 1:02:48.880]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[1:02:48.880 --> 1:02:59.000]  So that's what we need to do is peacefully, non-violently, but very aggressively in civil
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:02.720]  disobedience. We'll talk with Dr. Zalinko, good friend of mine, great patriot for humanity.
[1:03:02.720 --> 1:03:09.360]  In just a few minutes we're going to break. But we can joke and laugh about this all day.
[1:03:09.360 --> 1:03:15.000]  This is really, really, really, really serious. And we now have more FDA documents that have
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:20.160]  come out confirming what Dr. Yedon said a year and a half ago and what Dr. Zalinko said
[1:03:20.160 --> 1:03:24.600]  and so much more. And Dr. Yedon has also come out, former chief scientist at Pfizer and
[1:03:24.600 --> 1:03:27.800]  said this is definitely a depopulation weapon.
[1:03:27.800 --> 1:03:32.440]  Six months ago he said it looks like it may be depopulation. He said now there is no doubt
[1:03:32.440 --> 1:03:38.120]  this is depopulation. That's like Michael Jordan saying there's no doubt he made the
[1:03:38.120 --> 1:03:45.720]  three-pointer. Michael Jordan knows basketball. Dr. Michael Yedon knows vaccines. And this
[1:03:45.720 --> 1:03:51.920]  is not a vaccine. You've got so many other scientists. You've got the inventor of mRNA
[1:03:51.920 --> 1:03:58.080]  technology coming out in emergency warnings. You notice the inventor of it was a little
[1:03:58.080 --> 1:04:02.920]  more tame about it the first year. Now he's like, no, it's depopulation. It's evil. We
[1:04:02.920 --> 1:04:07.600]  got to stop him. Just what Dr. Zalinko and I talked about the time before last he came
[1:04:07.600 --> 1:04:16.200]  on. And that was we are going to have to just come out and say everything that's going
[1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:20.200]  down, everything that's happening. We got to just admit they're killing us. Because
[1:04:20.200 --> 1:04:23.280]  if we argue, oh, this doesn't work. Oh, the vaccine is not perfect. You know, why are
[1:04:23.280 --> 1:04:29.480]  you wrong? If we do that, they keep winning. But that's not what's going on here. That's
[1:04:29.480 --> 1:04:37.160]  not what's happening. This is premeditated plan from the beginning. All right, we're
[1:04:37.160 --> 1:04:40.600]  getting Dr. Zalinko hooked up right now, getting his camera working here. We're going to go
[1:04:40.600 --> 1:04:45.720]  to break and come back in 60 seconds with him straight ahead. Mpholwars.com. Tomorrow's
[1:04:45.720 --> 1:04:52.560]  news today. And please don't forget freeworldnews.tv. It's the same address is banned out video
[1:04:52.560 --> 1:05:00.080]  on a blocked link.
[1:05:00.080 --> 1:05:04.040]  Since the end of World War Two, the globalist have been building their private corporate
[1:05:04.040 --> 1:05:09.280]  world government whose end game once they get control is forced depopulation of the
[1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:14.440]  planet. That's why as we begin to leave the year 2021 and go into 2022, I am encouraging
[1:05:14.440 --> 1:05:18.160]  all of you out there watching and listening to count the cost and to realize how much
[1:05:18.160 --> 1:05:23.040]  danger you and your family are in. The globalist are coming after everybody. They are setting
[1:05:23.040 --> 1:05:30.040]  up a dystopic planetary authoritarian technocracy, a dictatorship of the globalist. Ladies and
[1:05:30.040 --> 1:05:34.040]  gentlemen, Mpholwars is the tip of the spear. Your investment in us over the years buying
[1:05:34.040 --> 1:05:37.600]  our products, spreading the word and praying for us has been incredible. But I'm telling
[1:05:37.600 --> 1:05:41.720]  you right now, we're about to lose not just Mpholwars, but the entire country and the
[1:05:41.720 --> 1:05:46.400]  world of tyranny. So now everything you've done in the past needs to be redoubled today.
[1:05:46.400 --> 1:05:50.520]  And MpholwarsStore.com is one of the most important places you can go to buy great products
[1:05:50.520 --> 1:05:54.200]  and fund the tip of the spear. I will go down with the ship. I'm not going to back down.
[1:05:54.200 --> 1:05:57.680]  I'm getting even more hardcore in their face, but I can't stay in the fight at 100% unless
[1:05:57.680 --> 1:06:08.320]  you support us. So please go to MpholwarsStore.com.
[1:06:08.320 --> 1:06:14.520]  So if it's going to be used, it's better to focus on those groups who have risk of severe
[1:06:14.520 --> 1:06:21.360]  disease and death rather than as we see some countries are using to give boosters to children,
[1:06:21.360 --> 1:06:28.040]  which is not right. So when your government scientists tell you
[1:06:28.040 --> 1:06:34.960]  that a variant that's 0.3% different from SARS could masquerade as a new virus and be
[1:06:34.960 --> 1:06:41.320]  a threat to your health, you should know, and I'm telling you, they are lying. If they're
[1:06:41.320 --> 1:06:48.800]  lying and they are, why is the pharmaceutical industry making top up vaccines? They are
[1:06:48.800 --> 1:06:54.400]  making them. You should be terrified at this point as I am, because there's absolutely
[1:06:54.400 --> 1:07:00.840]  no possible justification for their manufacture. But they're being made and the world's medicines
[1:07:00.840 --> 1:07:05.120]  regulators have said, because they're quite similar to the original vaccines, the ones
[1:07:05.120 --> 1:07:10.360]  that are being given now, we won't be asking them to do any clinical safety studies. So
[1:07:10.360 --> 1:07:14.600]  let me just say again, the variants are not different enough to represent a threat to
[1:07:14.600 --> 1:07:19.720]  you. So you do not need to top up vaccines yet. They are being made and the regulators
[1:07:19.720 --> 1:07:25.360]  have more or less waved them through. I'm very frightened of that. There's no possible
[1:07:25.360 --> 1:07:31.040]  benign interpretation of this. I believe that they're going to be used to damage your health
[1:07:31.040 --> 1:07:38.120]  and possibly kill you, seriously. I can see no sensible interpretation other than a serious
[1:07:38.120 --> 1:07:44.520]  attempt at mass depopulation. This will provide the tools to do it and plausible deniability
[1:07:44.520 --> 1:07:49.600]  because they'll create another story about some sort of biological threat and you'll
[1:07:49.600 --> 1:07:53.880]  line up and get your top up vaccines in a few months or a year or so later, you'll die
[1:07:53.880 --> 1:07:59.520]  of some peculiar, explicable syndrome and they won't be able to associate it with the
[1:07:59.520 --> 1:08:04.120]  top up vaccines. But that's my belief that they're lying to you about variants so they
[1:08:04.120 --> 1:08:10.320]  can make damaging top up vaccines that you don't need at all. And I think they'll be
[1:08:10.320 --> 1:08:14.920]  used for malign purposes. And if you don't wake up, that's what's going to happen I think
[1:08:14.920 --> 1:08:16.960]  during next year.
[1:08:16.960 --> 1:08:23.520]  Well, that's really scary and it's true. It's Dr. Michael Edon, former head of the
[1:08:23.520 --> 1:08:30.360]  Technology Division and the head scientist of respiratory viruses at Pfizer. And Dr.
[1:08:30.360 --> 1:08:34.400]  Robert Malone's the inventor of mRNA technology. The first year and a half, he's like, maybe
[1:08:34.400 --> 1:08:37.600]  they're idiots, maybe they don't know, but this is going to hurt a lot of people. Now
[1:08:37.600 --> 1:08:41.400]  he's like, no, it's premeditated, it's evil, we got to stop them because you cannot deny
[1:08:41.400 --> 1:08:46.960]  that. I had Dr. Zelinko on time before last about a month ago and I'm not tooting our
[1:08:46.960 --> 1:08:50.320]  horn. I'm saying we know what we're talking about. Please listen to us because I want
[1:08:50.320 --> 1:08:54.040]  to get out of this with our lives. I want you to get out of it as well. This is real.
[1:08:54.040 --> 1:08:58.880]  It's the biggest threat in the last human development. This is the biggest event ever.
[1:08:58.880 --> 1:09:05.880]  You cannot debate that this is like Hitler on steroids and that if we don't identify
[1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:09.440]  it's on purpose and if we don't identify these are war criminals and if we don't identify
[1:09:09.440 --> 1:09:15.320]  they cooked it up on purpose, then they keep to being able to debate us and argue little
[1:09:15.320 --> 1:09:22.440]  fine points and keep people distracted. So that is not the point that we're making here.
[1:09:22.440 --> 1:09:27.560]  This is not some accidental thing. These aren't just companies that mean well that screwed
[1:09:27.560 --> 1:09:32.760]  up and all this garbage. These are individuals that are using this to take over the planet
[1:09:32.760 --> 1:09:38.800]  and it's in the great reset documents and it's an incredible time to be alive. So Dr.
[1:09:38.800 --> 1:09:44.480]  Zelinko joins us here. He needs no introduction. So much has happened. He also issued an alert
[1:09:44.480 --> 1:09:48.920]  yesterday that if something happens to him, that he's not died of cancer, which he's
[1:09:48.920 --> 1:09:53.640]  fighting right now, but it could be foul play. I want to say the same thing. I'm getting
[1:09:53.640 --> 1:09:57.280]  a lot of death threats right now. We're not being dramatic, folks. We're at the tip of
[1:09:57.280 --> 1:10:02.280]  the spear exposing mass murderers. This is a war. Like Marshall McLuhan said 50 years
[1:10:02.280 --> 1:10:05.960]  ago, in the future the war is going to be distributed to the general public. It's not
[1:10:05.960 --> 1:10:10.120]  going to be main armies against each other. So Dr. Zelinko, so much going on, so much
[1:10:10.120 --> 1:10:15.760]  happening. Thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday broadcast. Hi Alex, thanks
[1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:20.360]  again for having me. I got a lot of questions and a lot to say and a lot to break down and
[1:10:20.360 --> 1:10:23.960]  I want you to be able to take us where you want to go first. So take us there and then
[1:10:23.960 --> 1:10:29.720]  I want to talk to you about Dr. Michael Yidon, who I know you talk a lot about, getting even
[1:10:29.720 --> 1:10:34.400]  more hardcore now and basically aligning with what you and I are saying. It isn't about
[1:10:34.400 --> 1:10:38.760]  us being right, but I think it's key to really have people face what we're up against. We
[1:10:38.760 --> 1:10:44.520]  don't really have any chance of beating it. So we're going to win. It's like someone who
[1:10:44.520 --> 1:10:50.400]  plays chess. The better chess player you are, the more moves ahead you could see and I see
[1:10:50.400 --> 1:10:56.280]  already that it's a checkmate. The only question that's still a variable is how much carnage
[1:10:56.280 --> 1:11:01.480]  and what will be the body count of the innocent until we get to that point. And the reason
[1:11:01.480 --> 1:11:07.640]  why I'm doing these interviews is that I hope that spreading the true narrative and giving
[1:11:07.640 --> 1:11:14.200]  people hope may mitigate or reduce the body count. And so regarding Dr. Michael Yidon,
[1:11:14.200 --> 1:11:19.600]  I know him personally. He's a mentor of mine. He's a brilliant scientist, former vice president
[1:11:19.600 --> 1:11:26.880]  of Pfizer. And he told me personally that for every one child that dies from COVID, 100
[1:11:26.880 --> 1:11:34.400]  die from the vaccine. The vaccine is 100 times more lethal to children than the virus. I
[1:11:34.400 --> 1:11:40.680]  think it's more than that, but he has the statistics and the data analysis to prove
[1:11:40.680 --> 1:11:45.760]  that and he has actually presented that information to the world. He's a man of integrity. He
[1:11:45.760 --> 1:11:52.680]  has only what to lose from coming out of retirement. He's a very wealthy man. He doesn't need all
[1:11:52.680 --> 1:11:56.600]  this aggravation. The only reason why he's doing it is I believe that he's being motivated
[1:11:56.600 --> 1:12:07.960]  by altruism and a genuine desire to protect people from carnage. Now, I think that it's
[1:12:07.960 --> 1:12:16.000]  extremely important to understand what is the motivation behind the criminals and monsters
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:20.880]  that have done this. And everyone should believe a word I'm saying. They should just listen
[1:12:20.880 --> 1:12:26.680]  and then do their own due diligence. And I provided for you resources and references
[1:12:26.680 --> 1:12:32.920]  to what I'm about to say, but much of which I'm sure you know. But 30 years ago, it became
[1:12:32.920 --> 1:12:38.960]  obvious to the people in power and people who are the wealthiest, most powerful people
[1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:44.560]  on the planet that there was going to be a major catastrophe economically in 30 years.
[1:12:44.560 --> 1:12:51.960]  There would be a collapse bankruptcy of the beginning, a bankruptcy of social security
[1:12:51.960 --> 1:12:58.240]  and Medicare. And that's all known. And Biden's recent policies of increased entitlements
[1:12:58.240 --> 1:13:06.640]  have upped the date to the anticipated collapse to 2027, 2026, used to be 2028. That's the
[1:13:06.640 --> 1:13:13.320]  beginning. And within 10 years, there'll be a complete bankruptcy that will have a tsunami
[1:13:13.320 --> 1:13:22.520]  effect on the global economy and threaten the stakeholders, their power and their wealth
[1:13:22.520 --> 1:13:29.600]  and control mechanisms over humanity, which they've had cultivated over millennia. We're
[1:13:29.600 --> 1:13:43.280]  talking about a force of evil that has always used human slavery as an asset. Slavery is
[1:13:43.280 --> 1:13:48.400]  always been the most lucrative industry in the history of humanity. And these people
[1:13:48.400 --> 1:13:54.480]  are amoral. They're not immoral. They are amoral, which means they are moral when it's
[1:13:54.480 --> 1:14:00.040]  expedient to them. They're immoral when it's expedient to them. They support the Jews when
[1:14:00.040 --> 1:14:04.440]  it's expedient to them. They support the Christians when it's useful to them. And then they set
[1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:09.000]  the Jews against the Christians and vice versa when it's useful for them. They're capitalists
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:15.840]  when they need to be. They're communists when they need to be. This level of malevolence
[1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:22.000]  transcends all of these systems that they have set, and they play games and create chaos
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:27.360]  and geopolitical destabilization in order to promote their own agenda. In this particular
[1:14:27.360 --> 1:14:32.640]  case, it became obvious to everyone that there was going to be a huge economic collapse and
[1:14:32.640 --> 1:14:38.880]  they were threatened. So what have they done? They've initiated a plan over the last 30
[1:14:38.880 --> 1:14:47.120]  years that will result in, when the system collapses and the dust settles, they will
[1:14:47.120 --> 1:14:53.800]  have the new financial infrastructure and control mechanisms to lead to the ultimate
[1:14:53.800 --> 1:15:02.120]  enslavement of humanity. And let me explain. In 2016, everyone knows, Klaus Schwab said
[1:15:02.120 --> 1:15:09.640]  that within 10 years, meaning by 2026, right before the anticipated collapse, 7 billion
[1:15:09.640 --> 1:15:18.720]  people will be tagged with a digital tracking device, essentially. A biometric sensor that
[1:15:18.720 --> 1:15:26.600]  transmits biometric data with your location to a third party. And it's not science fiction.
[1:15:26.600 --> 1:15:29.200]  There's a patent, which we've spoken about several times.
[1:15:29.200 --> 1:15:33.720]  And he said on French TV, he said, first you'll wear it, then it'll be on the skin.
[1:15:33.720 --> 1:15:38.480]  Right. That's Klaus Schwab saying that, and I have that video. But in addition to that,
[1:15:38.480 --> 1:15:44.720]  there's a patent, the two patents that go hand in hand. The one patent that says that
[1:15:44.720 --> 1:15:50.480]  current vaccines have nanotechnology in them that allows them to measure your heart rate,
[1:15:50.480 --> 1:15:51.480]  your rest of career.
[1:15:51.480 --> 1:15:54.160]  Stay right there. We're going to come right back to you. This is riveting information.
[1:15:54.160 --> 1:16:00.800]  How does the link go? Please stay with us. Not just across the United States, but across
[1:16:00.800 --> 1:16:05.680]  the world. You see it on the sides of barns and on bumper stickers, on cars, and written
[1:16:05.680 --> 1:16:11.200]  on the side of bathroom walls. Alex Jones was right. That's become a maxim of people
[1:16:11.200 --> 1:16:14.840]  to communicate to others that they see through the fraud of the New World Order, that they're
[1:16:14.840 --> 1:16:19.720]  saying no to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, and the Great Reset. And so now, infowars credibility
[1:16:19.720 --> 1:16:24.800]  is stronger than it's ever been. And the globalists are now coming to try to shut us down after
[1:16:24.800 --> 1:16:28.840]  all their other attacks, and we can't let them do that. So you've invested in infowars
[1:16:28.840 --> 1:16:34.080]  over the years. I'm asking you to redouble those efforts now. It's a critical juncture.
[1:16:34.080 --> 1:16:39.120]  Or everything you've done in the past is for nothing. You have invested in justice and
[1:16:39.120 --> 1:16:44.120]  the truth and hardcore populace. You have done incredible things. And I'm telling you
[1:16:44.120 --> 1:16:50.560]  now, going in 2022, infowars has major underages to run an operation, and we need more funds
[1:16:50.560 --> 1:16:54.440]  in. So it's a 360 win. Get great products that are great for you and your family, your

[1:18:11.560 --> 1:18:16.800]  World Order would have already basically won if it wasn't for infowars. And I'm not bragging.
[1:18:16.800 --> 1:18:21.360]  I'm letting you know that together as a family, we have changed the world and that we have
[1:18:21.360 --> 1:18:26.880]  a responsibility because God put us in this position to not back down now at the very
[1:18:26.880 --> 1:18:31.480]  critical point. This is an infowar. And the globalists are trying to break your will and
[1:18:31.480 --> 1:18:36.920]  to moralize you. And I've produced a two-part course, Mind Wars Spirit Wars, six-plus hours
[1:18:36.920 --> 1:18:42.720]  that lays out the most game-changing information ever. It's available right now at resetwars.com.
[1:18:42.720 --> 1:18:49.000]  And through Christmas Day, we've extended the sale 25% off. So Reset Wars is now available

[1:18:58.240 --> 1:19:02.760]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in infowars live products. And that's
[1:19:02.760 --> 1:19:07.080]  why for more than two years, we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth. And we could never
[1:19:07.080 --> 1:19:12.640]  get the ingredients again until now. And we have reformulated and not just used the same
[1:19:12.640 --> 1:19:17.000]  ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger. So out of all the bone broths
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:20.960]  out there, I'm telling you, this is next level. Let's know what it's got in it. Cutting
[1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:26.000]  edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability. It's
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:31.280]  got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder, and a bunch
[1:19:31.280 --> 1:19:35.840]  of other amazing known berries, the turbocharger body with antioxidants. And then it's got
[1:19:35.840 --> 1:19:40.240]  a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium and sodium added. I mean this sucker
[1:19:40.240 --> 1:19:44.480]  has got everything for your electrolytes. It's got real organic cocoa butter powder
[1:19:44.480 --> 1:19:48.840]  with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt. And it just goes on and on. It
[1:19:48.840 --> 1:19:54.360]  is now back in stock. Ultimate Bone Broth Plus available at 20% off and free shipping
[1:19:54.360 --> 1:20:00.400]  out of the gates at infowarstore.com.
[1:20:00.400 --> 1:20:22.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:22.400 --> 1:20:28.720]  Now I've didn't talk to doctors and link up before he came on air today. And I didn't
[1:20:28.720 --> 1:20:31.760]  tell them I wanted to talk about the great reset and engineered financial collapse and
[1:20:31.760 --> 1:20:35.600]  how swab is now pre-programming. There's going to be a big cyber attack that they claim
[1:20:35.600 --> 1:20:38.960]  terrorist launch. We know who'll really launch it. And notice he just brought it up without
[1:20:38.960 --> 1:20:43.280]  us even asking because we're all synced up. That's God consciousness. That's what scares
[1:20:43.280 --> 1:20:52.280]  the Satanist. He wrote an article titled government is the enemy. What is really going on by doctors
[1:20:52.280 --> 1:20:58.320]  and linko. So doctor, please continue. You got caught up on the break getting into.
[1:20:58.320 --> 1:21:01.760]  They know they fraudulently created all this fashion reserve banking. They've created all
[1:21:01.760 --> 1:21:06.120]  these derivatives. They've taken the world over by it. But it's a scam. So instead of
[1:21:06.120 --> 1:21:10.360]  them all going to jail, they've come up with a plan to collapse the world economy, poses
[1:21:10.360 --> 1:21:15.880]  the saviors and depopulate the useful cedars in the process, which is what so many corrupt
[1:21:15.880 --> 1:21:19.480]  feudal lords have done in the past, like the Aztecs and others when they didn't want to
[1:21:19.480 --> 1:21:27.520]  feed their population. Please continue. Yeah, so the patent that I mentioned earlier gives
[1:21:27.520 --> 1:21:35.200]  the technology and the mechanism through which Klaus Schwab's prophecy, let's say about 7
[1:21:35.200 --> 1:21:43.080]  billion people having a digital identifier that connects them to a centralized network
[1:21:43.080 --> 1:21:49.480]  of grid or matrix is going to happen. And the second patent that goes together with that
[1:21:49.480 --> 1:21:56.960]  is what Microsoft has from 2020. It's 00, 2020, 0606, 0606. And that patent describes
[1:21:56.960 --> 1:22:02.800]  the linkage of biometric data transmission to cryptocurrency. And so let me explain
[1:22:02.800 --> 1:22:10.360]  to you what that actually means. It means that in the future, let's say 2026 at time,
[1:22:10.360 --> 1:22:14.640]  there'll be no more easy pass, there'll be no more Apple Pay, there'll be no more credit
[1:22:14.640 --> 1:22:23.720]  cards. It'll be biometric transaction. In other words, you are now injected with a technology
[1:22:23.720 --> 1:22:29.400]  that transmits your internal temperament and your internal data with your location to a
[1:22:29.400 --> 1:22:34.400]  third party. Now, and that will allow you to let's say put your hand on a scanner and
[1:22:34.400 --> 1:22:39.040]  then walk out from the supermarket. So the hipsters think it's cool. But the problem with
[1:22:39.040 --> 1:22:44.000]  that is, what if I don't want to be part of the matrix? What if I don't want to be injected
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:50.760]  with a tracking technology? Well, then I would be excluded from the system of finance. I
[1:22:50.760 --> 1:22:54.880]  won't be able to buy bread, at least not probably on the black market, but I won't be able to
[1:22:54.880 --> 1:22:59.320]  buy bread for my family. So it's a control mechanism. It's the mark of the beast. In
[1:22:59.320 --> 1:23:07.000]  other words, if I don't participate in the system that they have created and control,
[1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:12.640]  I will be excluded from the ability to do transactions, financial transactions. So they
[1:23:12.640 --> 1:23:18.440]  don't have to put a bullet in my head. They just have to prevent my ability to buy food
[1:23:18.440 --> 1:23:23.320]  for my family. And that's like the social credit system in China, where basically they
[1:23:23.320 --> 1:23:27.540]  could set a radius through which I can't go out of my house and put me on house arrest.
[1:23:27.540 --> 1:23:32.800]  They know my location. I step out out of my permitted radius, let's say, and they turn
[1:23:32.800 --> 1:23:41.000]  off my ability to do finance. So this is a control mechanism. And the entire crisis
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:46.560]  here has nothing to do with medicine, has nothing to do with health. If they're fools
[1:23:46.560 --> 1:23:50.960]  on this planet right now who actually think that the governing body is actually care about
[1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:56.960]  your well-being, then there's no hope for you. But the reality is that COVID-19 is a
[1:23:56.960 --> 1:24:00.960]  weapon of mass destruction. It was made in a laboratory. No one denies that. And I want
[1:24:00.960 --> 1:24:06.040]  to tell you something, Alex. I don't know if you realize that Ralph Barrick, Dr. Barrick,
[1:24:06.040 --> 1:24:11.280]  was involved in every step of the development of this bioweapon and converting it to a human
[1:24:11.280 --> 1:24:17.640]  virus. He took a bad coronavirus, changed some things on it, got a patent for it, and
[1:24:17.640 --> 1:24:23.680]  technology to convert it to a human virus. Then Dr. Barrick and Zheng Li and Wuhan funded
[1:24:23.680 --> 1:24:27.960]  by the NIH, they published a paper thanking the NIH, figured out how to augment the lethality
[1:24:27.960 --> 1:24:32.960]  of this virus to destroy human lung tissue. Which was key because Fauci wanted his HIV
[1:24:32.960 --> 1:24:38.760]  protein to be part of it so he could pay. Yes, but here's something you may not know.
[1:24:38.760 --> 1:24:46.480]  That in March of 2020, I came across data papers that helped me formulate my treatment
[1:24:46.480 --> 1:24:51.680]  approach based on zinc and zinc ionophores, which is what the Z-stack concept is. What
[1:24:51.680 --> 1:24:57.480]  I didn't realize until last week was that Ralph Barrick published that paper. Wow. Processed
[1:24:57.480 --> 1:25:03.280]  that. In other words, the guy who made the bomb also created the antidote to diffuse
[1:25:03.280 --> 1:25:08.840]  the bomb funded by the government. Incredible. And start over. Say that again. That is, no,
[1:25:08.840 --> 1:25:13.640]  I did not know that. This is groundbreaking. Explain, oh, Mike, you're a big researcher.
[1:25:13.640 --> 1:25:17.280]  That's how you found these treatments. Nobody else had. And then when you found the research
[1:25:17.280 --> 1:25:21.160]  paper, it's the guy that was engineering it all out of Chapel Hill, North Carolina,
[1:25:21.160 --> 1:25:26.240]  with Obama, with Fauci moving it. This is so huge. Please start over. And by the way,
[1:25:26.240 --> 1:25:33.480]  on your Skype is a link to that paper. Everything I'm saying, I have evidence for and it should
[1:25:33.480 --> 1:25:36.440]  be presented because otherwise it won't be believed. Yes, sir. We'll either put it on
[1:25:36.440 --> 1:25:40.320]  screen. We'll put it in post later. Once this is our cup, please start over. This is huge.
[1:25:40.320 --> 1:25:46.200]  All right. Fine. So Ralph Barrick in 1999 did research at the University of Chapel Hill.
[1:25:46.200 --> 1:25:54.560]  He was able to manipulate a bad animal virus, a bad coronavirus, converted by modulating
[1:25:54.560 --> 1:25:59.720]  a surface protein to infect human beings. But it was still benign. It was just infecting
[1:25:59.720 --> 1:26:07.560]  human beings then. And then in 2010, the same Ralph Barrick figure out a way to diffuse
[1:26:07.560 --> 1:26:14.080]  coronaviruses by using zinc and zinc ion, of course, inhibiting RNA dependent RNA polymerase
[1:26:14.080 --> 1:26:22.080]  or inhibiting a coronavirus replication. In 2015, and by the way, everything's here
[1:26:22.080 --> 1:26:26.800]  being funded by the United States government. It's all because it's on the papers. And on
[1:26:26.800 --> 1:26:30.840]  the peer reviewed papers, they thank the United States government, NIH or whatever, for the
[1:26:30.840 --> 1:26:39.600]  funding. Then in 2015, in Wuhan, Barrick, together in collaboration with Dr. Zheng Li,
[1:26:39.600 --> 1:26:46.200]  the bad lady, they were able to figure out a way to augment the payload of this weapon
[1:26:46.200 --> 1:26:52.640]  to destroy human lung tissue and cause blood clots. They wrote a paper about it. They thank
[1:26:52.640 --> 1:26:58.400]  the NIH, they published it, and they got patents on it. And here's another layer to the story.
[1:26:58.400 --> 1:27:06.960]  The same Ralph Barrick worked with the team from Gilead Pharmaceuticals to make remdesivir.
[1:27:06.960 --> 1:27:11.240]  Which destroys the kidneys and doesn't help you. This is so diabolical. So every way you
[1:27:11.240 --> 1:27:19.360]  can see the criminal pre-planning. Yes. And so this is a bio-weapon. And they
[1:27:19.360 --> 1:27:26.320]  had the antidote for it. And they suppressed the antidote intentionally, not for themselves.
[1:27:26.320 --> 1:27:32.680]  You think these masterminds want their own families to die? Of course not. They themselves
[1:27:32.680 --> 1:27:37.400]  know. This is consistent with what I knew about the executives of...
[1:27:37.400 --> 1:27:41.760]  Yeah, you broke that a year ago, and Joe Rogan confirmed it, that hundreds of members of
[1:27:41.760 --> 1:27:47.440]  Congress in Hollywood all know about this, but still want it suppressed, that your protocol,
[1:27:47.440 --> 1:27:51.680]  they were using your protocol, but they suppressed it for the general public. Talk about evil.
[1:27:51.680 --> 1:27:57.960]  Yeah, also the executives of Google, I know internally that they're all taking hydroxychloroquine
[1:27:57.960 --> 1:28:06.000]  and ivermectin. And so this information, the antidote to the bomb, the poison, was known,
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:13.480]  was created by the same monsters, but they hid it from you and me. Now, when doctors
[1:28:13.480 --> 1:28:21.240]  like myself stumbled across these approaches, because we had necessity, the patients were
[1:28:21.240 --> 1:28:28.000]  dying. And so we needed some help. We needed to treat the patients. And so immediately,
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:33.320]  anything that would help, hydroxychloroquine, then ivermectin, and even the concept of early
[1:28:33.320 --> 1:28:38.640]  intervention, getting rid of this infection before the complications begin, everything
[1:28:38.640 --> 1:28:45.000]  was vilified, marginalized, and doctors that were advocating for it were deplatformed.
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:49.200]  So what you laid out is, they knew it, they had it planned, they censored it, they did
[1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:52.520]  it all. We'll come back with Dr. Zelenko to explain how huge this is. Try to head and
[1:28:52.520 --> 1:28:59.120]  please stay with us.
[1:28:59.120 --> 1:29:03.080]  Since the end of World War II, the globalists have been building their private corporate
[1:29:03.080 --> 1:29:08.440]  world government whose end game, once they get control, is forced depopulation of the
[1:29:08.440 --> 1:29:13.520]  planet. That's why as we begin to leave the year 2021 and go into 2022, I am encouraging
[1:29:13.520 --> 1:29:17.240]  all of you out there watching and listening to count the cost and to realize how much
[1:29:17.240 --> 1:29:22.120]  danger you and your family are in. The globalists are coming after everybody. They are setting
[1:29:22.120 --> 1:29:29.100]  up a dystopic planetary authoritarian technocracy, a dictatorship of the globalist. Ladies and
[1:29:29.100 --> 1:29:33.120]  gentlemen, Info Wars is the tip of the spear. Your investment in us over the years, buying
[1:29:33.120 --> 1:29:36.680]  our products, spreading the word and praying for us has been incredible. But I'm telling
[1:29:36.680 --> 1:29:40.800]  you right now, we're about to lose not just Info Wars, but the entire country and the
[1:29:40.800 --> 1:29:45.440]  world of tyranny. So now, everything you've done in the past needs to be redoubled today.
[1:29:45.440 --> 1:29:49.800]  And InfoWarsStore.com is one of the most important places you can go to migrate products and
[1:29:49.800 --> 1:29:53.240]  fund the tip of the spear. I will go down with the ship. I'm not going to back down.
[1:29:53.240 --> 1:29:56.720]  I'm getting even more hardcore in their face. But I can't stay in the fight at 100% unless
[1:29:56.720 --> 1:30:01.040]  you support us. So please go to InfoWarsStore.com. Not just across the United States, but across
[1:30:01.040 --> 1:30:05.920]  the world. You see it on the sides of barns and on bumper stickers, on cars, and written
[1:30:05.920 --> 1:30:11.440]  on the side of bathroom walls, Alex Jones was right. That's become a maxim of people
[1:30:11.440 --> 1:30:15.080]  to communicate to others that they see through the fraud of the New World Order, that they're
[1:30:15.080 --> 1:30:19.960]  saying no to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, and the Great Reset. And so now, InfoWars' credibility
[1:30:19.960 --> 1:30:25.040]  is stronger than it's ever been. And the globalists are now coming to try to shut us down after
[1:30:25.040 --> 1:30:29.120]  all their other attacks. And we can't let them do that. So you've invested InfoWars
[1:30:29.120 --> 1:30:34.320]  over the years. I'm asking you to redouble those efforts now at this critical juncture.
[1:30:34.320 --> 1:30:39.360]  Or everything you've done in the past is for nothing. You have invested in justice and
[1:30:39.360 --> 1:30:44.360]  the truth and hardcore populace. You have done incredible things. And I'm telling you
[1:30:44.360 --> 1:30:50.680]  now, going in 2022, InfoWars has major underages to run an operation and we need more funds
[1:30:50.680 --> 1:30:54.680]  in. So it's a 360 win. Get great products that are great for you and your family, your
[1:30:54.680 --> 1:30:57.480]  immune system, and so much more. So please go to InfoWars.com.
[1:31:25.680 --> 1:31:29.760]  Tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear
[1:31:29.760 --> 1:31:33.680]  the truth. So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda.
[1:31:33.680 --> 1:31:37.440]  And we've also got to get personally prepared. And one of the number one things to do is
[1:31:37.440 --> 1:31:41.160]  high quality, storeable food. You've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable
[1:31:41.160 --> 1:31:46.720]  prices at InfoWars.com. So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty

[1:31:56.520 --> 1:31:58.400]  ready at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:32:00.400 --> 1:32:05.120]  I want to explain something that is absolutely feed understanding our world. It's very, very
[1:32:05.120 --> 1:32:10.080]  simple, but the most people don't know. The privately owned central banks of the world
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:16.960]  are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars and other major currencies and
[1:32:16.960 --> 1:32:24.320]  using them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual property, energy. They're using it to buy
[1:32:24.320 --> 1:32:29.560]  people, to buy influence. And in the past, they created thousands of trillions so that
[1:32:29.560 --> 1:32:34.480]  they could leverage that manipulate markets, but they never allowed that money to get into
[1:32:34.480 --> 1:32:38.440]  the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation. Now they've gone ahead
[1:32:38.440 --> 1:32:44.360]  and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy, buying up everything.
[1:32:44.360 --> 1:32:49.080]  Not to have the companies operate, but to actually shut them down and force a collapse
[1:32:49.080 --> 1:32:54.160]  of civilization. Making the companies they do fund, the only thing's left handed. The
[1:32:54.160 --> 1:32:58.160]  Great Recess is what's happening now. Warn everyone, it's the only way to stop it.
[1:33:00.160 --> 1:33:06.560]  Leading up front to assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:06.560 --> 1:33:30.760]  And again, I would apologize for 14 minutes of ads an hour, but that's the standard for
[1:33:30.760 --> 1:33:35.160]  talk radio and TV and I hate going to break with Dr. Zalinko saying something so important,
[1:33:35.160 --> 1:33:40.920]  but it's all hard, it's all hard wired in by the satellite feeds that literally cut
[1:33:40.920 --> 1:33:45.160]  into the radio stations. That's why on the D platforming off the main internet, we stayed
[1:33:45.160 --> 1:33:49.080]  on air because we had over 200 radio stations and we still do. So we're very thankful to
[1:33:49.080 --> 1:33:54.000]  those stations, but I am going to start the new year three nights a week, at least three
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:58.880]  nights a week, a multi hour commercial free podcast, direct to you the viewers and listeners
[1:33:58.880 --> 1:34:02.720]  with guests and callers, where I might take a break to go to the bathroom or get a cup
[1:34:02.720 --> 1:34:06.120]  of coffee or something, but it's not going to have regular commercial breaks. So look
[1:34:06.120 --> 1:34:09.720]  for that in the new year, something I promised to do. The world's so crazy we're here. But
[1:34:09.720 --> 1:34:12.880]  Dr. Zalinko, I know our listeners are smart, they're awesome people, but I want them to
[1:34:12.880 --> 1:34:18.360]  get what you're saying. You're laying out any grand jury, it would take a few weeks
[1:34:18.360 --> 1:34:22.400]  to give a grand jury all this, but they would definitely indict Fauci for what you're saying.
[1:34:22.400 --> 1:34:27.680]  You're laying out the compendium of basically how this criminal plan was set up. And when
[1:34:27.680 --> 1:34:31.120]  you see how criminal it was, like you were saying last time you were on, months before
[1:34:31.120 --> 1:34:36.680]  the outbreak, their gates and Fauci are already sending messages saying get the vaccine ready.
[1:34:36.680 --> 1:34:40.900]  You're like, wait, they didn't make the vaccine. No, they own the patents to what vaccine they
[1:34:40.900 --> 1:34:45.400]  quote wanted to then be sent out to the major makers, which they also got paid money from.
[1:34:45.400 --> 1:34:51.760]  So the trail, I think is what you're saying of them scientifically preparing this is one
[1:34:51.760 --> 1:34:56.040]  of the most open and shut premeditated murder cases ever. Is that what you're saying?
[1:34:56.040 --> 1:35:02.720]  I'm saying this is the worst crime in human history. It's a genocide, it's mass murder,
[1:35:02.720 --> 1:35:09.080]  first degree premeditated genocide and mass murder. And it's being driven essentially
[1:35:09.080 --> 1:35:20.040]  by demonic personalities that are absolutely obsessed with power and wealth, but more than
[1:35:20.040 --> 1:35:23.960]  wealth, I think it's power because once you have $100 billion left, what's the difference
[1:35:23.960 --> 1:35:30.400]  if you have $150 billion? You don't feel it, but power and being able to enslave others,
[1:35:30.400 --> 1:35:38.120]  it fulfills the perverse desires of these narcissists, egotists, and really, I would
[1:35:38.120 --> 1:35:45.160]  be and call them Satan incarnate or the embodiment of the essence of evil. And I actually want
[1:35:45.160 --> 1:35:52.880]  to, you know who Barbara Marx Hubbard was? Yes. Okay, she is the demonic mother of the
[1:35:52.880 --> 1:35:58.320]  New World Order. She, I hope she burns and help all the time. She, and I'm going to read
[1:35:58.320 --> 1:36:04.760]  you a few quotes from her that will explain to you the philosophy. She's the ideology,
[1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:10.800]  the mother of the ideology of Klaus Schwab, let's say. One fourth of humanity must be
[1:36:10.800 --> 1:36:17.800]  eliminated from the social body. It's a quote. We are in charge of God's selection process
[1:36:17.800 --> 1:36:27.480]  for planet Earth. He selects, we destroy. We are the writers of the pale horse death.
[1:36:27.480 --> 1:36:35.160]  End quote. Another quote from her. This act is as horrible as killing a cancer cell. It
[1:36:35.160 --> 1:36:42.480]  must be done for the sake of the future of the whole. So be it. Be prepared for the selection
[1:36:42.480 --> 1:36:49.720]  process, which is now beginning. We, the elders have been patiently waiting until the very
[1:36:49.720 --> 1:36:58.320]  last moment before the quantum transformation to take action to cut out this corrupted and
[1:36:58.320 --> 1:37:04.160]  corrupting element in the human in the body of humanity. It is like watching a cancer
[1:37:04.160 --> 1:37:10.920]  grow. Something must be done before the whole body is destroyed. The destructive one fourth
[1:37:10.920 --> 1:37:16.400]  must be eliminated from the social body. I want to read you one more quote, not from
[1:37:16.400 --> 1:37:25.800]  her from the names of Jacques at Pali. He was the advisor to the French prime minister
[1:37:25.800 --> 1:37:32.680]  from 1981 till till in the nineties, I think 1991. Yeah, that was a meter on who was a
[1:37:32.680 --> 1:37:40.280]  big Luciferian. Please continue. Yes. So he was Mitterrand's right hand man. And this
[1:37:40.280 --> 1:37:50.320]  is from a book called verbatim in 1981. Now, the Facebook fact checker myth, busters or
[1:37:50.320 --> 1:37:55.600]  myth, whatever it's called, says that this isn't true. But this is how I know that this
[1:37:55.600 --> 1:38:02.400]  this must true. The future will be about finding a way to reduce the population. Of course,
[1:38:02.400 --> 1:38:08.120]  we will not be able to execute people or build camps. We get rid of them by making them believe
[1:38:08.120 --> 1:38:17.080]  it is for their own good. We'll find or cause something a pandemic targeting certain people.
[1:38:17.080 --> 1:38:24.240]  A real economic crisis or not, a virus affecting the old or the elderly. It doesn't matter.
[1:38:24.240 --> 1:38:30.880]  The weak and the fearful will succumb to it. The stupid will believe in it and ask to be
[1:38:30.880 --> 1:38:38.720]  treated. We will have taken care of having panned the treatment, a treatment that will
[1:38:38.720 --> 1:38:46.880]  be the solution. The selection of idiots will therefore be done by itself. They will go
[1:38:46.880 --> 1:38:49.680]  to the slaughterhouse alone.
[1:38:49.680 --> 1:38:50.880]  Wow.
[1:38:50.880 --> 1:38:55.200]  Doctors, let me just say this because this is about God consciousness and I don't say
[1:38:55.200 --> 1:39:00.440]  something that isn't true, but it's a little embarrassing to say just because it's so personal.
[1:39:00.440 --> 1:39:03.560]  You normally, it takes about a week to get you on the show. Today, you were able to come
[1:39:03.560 --> 1:39:07.200]  on. I had a dream about you last night, but I couldn't remember the dream when I woke
[1:39:07.200 --> 1:39:12.120]  up. When I got up, I said, I got to get Zalinko on today. And then I said, what was the dream
[1:39:12.120 --> 1:39:16.800]  about? I couldn't remember. And then I just remembered that I said to myself, well, Zalinko
[1:39:16.800 --> 1:39:19.800]  kind of says the same thing every time he's on. It's like you do. It's not an attack.
[1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:23.560]  It's true. Same emergency message. But I said, no, today is going to be different. And then
[1:39:23.560 --> 1:39:28.560]  I intended to come in here and talk about the population, talk about the UN, talk about
[1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:34.080]  Schwab and talk about, she wasn't even by name, but those same groups. And then here
[1:39:34.080 --> 1:39:39.440]  you said it. This is amazing. And I'm not trying to be weird about it. It's just true.
[1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:42.240]  So I feel like I should have said that. Go ahead.
[1:39:42.240 --> 1:39:48.000]  Listen, truth is truth. It is a certain, it's in the air, you know, and people that are
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  attuned to it. I think it's become much more accessible to anyone who wants to access and
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:57.840]  download this information. It's nothing about metaphysically that there's an intuitive
[1:39:57.840 --> 1:40:03.800]  sense of what's true and what's not. Anyone who has some degree of sensitivity sees that
[1:40:03.800 --> 1:40:12.720]  this is an attempt by the forces of evil to steal God consciousness and then use fear
[1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:19.960]  to breed codependency and occult codependency on sociopaths and corrupt governments and
[1:40:19.960 --> 1:40:23.680]  a belief in the golden calf of these like false promises.
[1:40:23.680 --> 1:40:27.640]  God knows evils coming after us and God's opened the floodgates. That's what I feel actually.
[1:40:27.640 --> 1:40:31.360]  I mean, my discernment is way more powerful than it used to be. Are you seeing the same
[1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:34.840]  thing? But yeah, but I see it actually in a different
[1:40:34.840 --> 1:40:41.240]  way that I see that God is giving every human being an opportunity. It's like we're in
[1:40:41.240 --> 1:40:47.520]  the generation right before the flood of Noah and God is saying, listen, repent and get
[1:40:47.520 --> 1:40:53.520]  on the on the ark. Don't stay in the turbulent waters of idol worship and child sacrifice
[1:40:53.520 --> 1:40:58.320]  and paganism. You see, it's the decisions of man. If you know, there's a psychoanalyst
[1:40:58.320 --> 1:41:06.440]  I'll remember in a minute, but Carl Jung, he wrote that the degradation of a society
[1:41:06.440 --> 1:41:12.160]  begins at the degradation, moral degradation of an individual. And so you can learn vice
[1:41:12.160 --> 1:41:17.440]  versa that the moral improvement of a society begins with the refinement of the individual.
[1:41:17.440 --> 1:41:24.000]  And so it's some total of all of our bad decisions over the last whatever period of time that
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:30.840]  has led to the slaughter of the unborn, the defamation and desecration of gender roles,
[1:41:30.840 --> 1:41:39.720]  the desecration of what marriage is, the perversion and poisoning of the youth through the public
[1:41:39.720 --> 1:41:46.920]  school system, which teaches debauchery and normalizes the worst behavior, immoral behavior.
[1:41:46.920 --> 1:41:51.960]  So basically, this country has drifted away from Judeo-Christian morals and let's just
[1:41:51.960 --> 1:41:57.000]  keep it simple, the Ten Commandments. And so therefore, it's not surprising to me that
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:03.120]  there comes a kind of a tipping point that's crossed the threshold that's been passed through
[1:42:03.120 --> 1:42:08.240]  collective humanity where God says, okay, now it's time for a cleaning. And I think
[1:42:08.240 --> 1:42:15.160]  that's what we're going through. And it may be the best result here is that people repent.
[1:42:15.160 --> 1:42:22.360]  They return back to the umbrella of the divine will, they live a moral life, they respect
[1:42:22.360 --> 1:42:28.600]  life, the sanctity of life, they respect marriage, they respect children and the unborn and so
[1:42:28.600 --> 1:42:36.200]  on. And that could avert a major body count. However, regardless of whether or not people
[1:42:36.200 --> 1:42:43.080]  are going to realize that the cleansing will happen. And so what it's again, every single
[1:42:43.080 --> 1:42:49.000]  individual right now is being given a choice and that choice is from God. And here's the
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:52.360]  question, who are you going to bow down to? I agree. Stay right there. There's a final
[1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:58.840]  segment. Talk about solutions straight ahead. We'll be right back.
[1:42:58.840 --> 1:43:04.960]  Resetwars.com is the coordinates on the Internet where you can find the most important information
[1:43:04.960 --> 1:43:12.680]  I've produced in 28 years on air. A lot of what's in the courses is known. A lot isn't,
[1:43:12.680 --> 1:43:18.280]  but it's my particular perspective in my definitions and my way of seeing the world. Doesn't mean
[1:43:18.280 --> 1:43:22.600]  it's perfectly right. As the Bible says, we all see through a rose color darkly, but we've
[1:43:22.600 --> 1:43:28.360]  proven that we've got some of the clearest cutting edge discernment out there. And I
[1:43:28.360 --> 1:43:33.520]  want you to have access to this information because you need these tools, in my experience
[1:43:33.520 --> 1:43:37.680]  at least, to stand for the globalists and not let them break your will. And so through
[1:43:37.680 --> 1:43:46.680]  Christmas Day, the course is 25% off at resetwars.com. And it's not just an amazing game-changing
[1:43:46.680 --> 1:43:53.040]  consciousness-raising course. It also funds the Info War, so it's a true 360 win. Resetwars.com,

[1:44:08.280 --> 1:44:23.720]  Doing that, not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of God, the Creator, and
[1:44:23.720 --> 1:44:30.360]  we are powerful. And the social engineers fear that so much. So that's why I repeat that
[1:44:30.360 --> 1:44:36.760]  famous Internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy, is it true? The
[1:44:36.760 --> 1:44:42.880]  boys, they know we are strong, and they know in the end they signed on to God of this world
[1:44:42.880 --> 1:44:47.040]  who is a loser. And that's why it's so important that everybody keep Info Wars in the air now
[1:44:47.040 --> 1:44:51.720]  more than ever. Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting
[1:44:51.720 --> 1:44:56.600]  and setting up is satanic. And we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the
[1:44:56.600 --> 1:45:01.240]  beast they just announced. Why do my enemies hate me so much? Why do the globalists take
[1:45:01.240 --> 1:45:07.240]  you so much? Why do they hate America so much? Because it's an idea of freedom that their
[1:45:07.240 --> 1:45:13.240]  tyrannical system that they're pushing cannot coexist with. It's very, very simple. For
[1:45:13.240 --> 1:45:20.360]  their world government, their anti-human, post-human, eugenics system to flourish, freedom and liberty
[1:45:20.360 --> 1:45:26.800]  and due process, injustice and God fearing systems must fail. So sure, you didn't start
[1:45:26.800 --> 1:45:31.640]  a fight with Bill Gates. You didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller. You didn't
[1:45:31.640 --> 1:45:37.640]  start a fight with the UN. They started a fight with you. And they're not going to back down
[1:45:37.640 --> 1:45:43.160]  and they're not going to go away. And they're not going to ever stop their attacks until
[1:45:43.160 --> 1:45:47.440]  they have the fear of God put into them. The average person still doesn't even know about
[1:45:47.440 --> 1:45:51.960]  the New World Order or about globalism or about corporate fascism. And it's not until
[1:45:51.960 --> 1:45:56.960]  people understand that and that we're under attack that we have any chance of beating
[1:45:56.960 --> 1:45:57.960]  these people.
[1:45:57.960 --> 1:46:01.960]  Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome.
[1:46:01.960 --> 1:46:02.960]  Hello, Alex.
[1:46:02.960 --> 1:46:03.960]  Yes, Malcolm.
[1:46:03.960 --> 1:46:07.280]  All right. I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the
[1:46:07.280 --> 1:46:12.360]  line. Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer. Super
[1:46:12.360 --> 1:46:18.120]  Mel Vitality and Brain Force Plus. Mix those two together. You're an unstoppable tank.
[1:46:18.120 --> 1:46:23.200]  Super Mel Vitality really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that
[1:46:23.200 --> 1:46:29.200]  have never been heated up. And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions
[1:46:29.200 --> 1:46:33.360]  that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong. This is like a very fine wine.
[1:46:33.360 --> 1:46:37.840]  In fact, each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay.
[1:46:37.840 --> 1:46:41.360]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[1:46:41.360 --> 1:46:46.280]  That's just how it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's
[1:46:46.280 --> 1:46:51.200]  like super strong. But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is
[1:46:51.200 --> 1:47:00.920]  it.
[1:47:00.920 --> 1:47:12.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:12.480 --> 1:47:17.200]  You know, I've got another Barbara Max Hubbard quote for you. She's one of the gurus of
[1:47:17.200 --> 1:47:22.360]  Hillary Clinton. She's dead now, gone to hell. But she talks about we are the pale horse
[1:47:22.360 --> 1:47:26.440]  death. We're the New World Order. We're going to carry all this out. I'll pull that quote
[1:47:26.440 --> 1:47:30.880]  up for you coming up here in just a few minutes, but I was just paraphrasing it. But Dr. Zalinko,
[1:47:30.880 --> 1:47:34.320]  medical doctor who helped get the first treatments out to save millions of people, he's here
[1:47:34.320 --> 1:47:41.640]  with us. And I wanted to talk about where we're going here because everything Satan does
[1:47:41.640 --> 1:47:46.800]  is a counterfeit. And so Satan says, Oh, I'm going to call the people. I'm going to make
[1:47:46.800 --> 1:47:52.120]  them make the decision. I'm going to make them decide which side they're on. But then
[1:47:52.120 --> 1:47:56.680]  really that's God's plan. It's up to us individually to choose not for Satan to make those choices
[1:47:56.680 --> 1:48:02.680]  for us. And here's Jack Pasobak, who's a smart guy, pretty clear Biden is only crediting
[1:48:02.680 --> 1:48:08.040]  Trump for the vaccine to set him up to take the blame for what comes next. I think that's
[1:48:08.040 --> 1:48:12.880]  a very simple, neutral way to say it. And now Trump is rubbing it in after speeches in
[1:48:12.880 --> 1:48:17.400]  Texas saying take the shot is totally safe. It totally works. None of that's true. Trump
[1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:21.920]  says most Americans dying or unvaccinated encourages everyone to get the shot. Now he
[1:48:21.920 --> 1:48:28.160]  loved Dr. Zalinko's protocol help promote it. I think Trump just thinks doctors are trustworthy.
[1:48:28.160 --> 1:48:31.880]  He hasn't heard of Joseph Mingla and I'm sorry to bring up a Nazi analogy, but it's the one
[1:48:31.880 --> 1:48:37.000]  that fits here. Dr. Zalinko, I think Trump's a good person, but I'm really worried about
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:42.840]  him with what he's doing here. I think he's being set up. What do you think?
[1:48:42.840 --> 1:48:49.080]  Whatever his motivations are, I have to publicly disagree with him. I think he's done a lot
[1:48:49.080 --> 1:48:54.320]  of good. I would say the main thing they did that was good was move the federal judiciary
[1:48:54.320 --> 1:49:01.640]  to the right with 300 more than 300 justices that are, you know, have Judeo-Christian values.
[1:49:01.640 --> 1:49:06.720]  I think that that did help move the country, the moral compass of this country. But what
[1:49:06.720 --> 1:49:09.960]  he's talking about when it comes to these vaccines, he really doesn't know what he's
[1:49:09.960 --> 1:49:15.760]  talking about. Or if he does, then I have a real problem with him because he's worried
[1:49:15.760 --> 1:49:22.720]  about his legacy. You know, he's a narcissist. And what he cares about now is his legacy.
[1:49:22.720 --> 1:49:30.360]  And he went warp speed due to political calculations. This I know for a fact, but he was looking
[1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:35.680]  into pre-hospital treatments and emphasizing that until hydroxychlorophen that became politically
[1:49:35.680 --> 1:49:42.120]  radioactive, and then he made a calculation, or this team got bad advice in my short, that
[1:49:42.120 --> 1:49:46.640]  shifted him towards warp speed, vaccine development, because he thought that was going to help
[1:49:46.640 --> 1:49:53.120]  him win reelection. And then he went after he secured his second term, go back to pre-hospital.
[1:49:53.120 --> 1:50:04.400]  I was told pre-hospital treatment. Now, the reality is that the vaccines were known, the
[1:50:04.400 --> 1:50:12.040]  side effects were known, and the FDA knew about it. And months before they released this poisonous
[1:50:12.040 --> 1:50:15.080]  deft shot on innocent humanity.
[1:50:15.080 --> 1:50:19.880]  That's how I'm going to get you back to you up. October FDA CDC documents said they knew
[1:50:19.880 --> 1:50:23.440]  all these things would happen that did happen. Please continue.
[1:50:23.440 --> 1:50:28.400]  Slide number 16. Yeah, that's exactly what I was referring to. And so, you know, he has
[1:50:28.400 --> 1:50:35.200]  a choice. I still hope that he chooses the right thing. I think that the deep state operatives
[1:50:35.200 --> 1:50:43.240]  like Rick Bright and Janet Woodcock, and I have evidence for all that sabotage his plan
[1:50:43.240 --> 1:50:48.920]  when he gave an order to make hydroxychloroquine available to all Americans, they spun it
[1:50:48.920 --> 1:50:53.040]  and issued an emergency use authorization that blocked access to patients that are not
[1:50:53.040 --> 1:51:00.280]  in the hospital. Exactly the opposite of what his intent was. And that killed 700 million
[1:51:00.280 --> 1:51:01.280]  people.
[1:51:01.280 --> 1:51:03.040]  Exactly. So, how does Trump extricate himself?
[1:51:03.040 --> 1:51:08.000]  I mean, how does Trump not be set up here?
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:13.480]  Well, he has to recognize that he was sabotaged. But forget about him. The American people
[1:51:13.480 --> 1:51:17.760]  were sabotaged. The interests of the American people, the lives and the sanctity of the
[1:51:17.760 --> 1:51:24.960]  Americans, our lives are desecrated. And so, the only position that he has is to backtrack
[1:51:24.960 --> 1:51:32.000]  and say, yes, I had my intuition initially was correct. The pre-hospital approach is
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:38.120]  the right approach. And now we see the evidence of these vaccines. They don't work and they're
[1:51:38.120 --> 1:51:43.600]  dangerous and most people don't need them. So, I'm pivoting now for the welfare of the
[1:51:43.600 --> 1:51:52.160]  American public and supporting proven data-driven solutions and that forced people to go on a
[1:51:52.160 --> 1:51:56.440]  path of self-destruction. He has to do a mea culpa. He has to say, I'm sorry, I made
[1:51:56.440 --> 1:51:57.440]  a mistake.
[1:51:57.440 --> 1:51:58.440]  I totally agree.
[1:51:58.440 --> 1:52:01.560]  I totally agree, Dr. Zelenko. And that's what I've been saying, because I know he got
[1:52:01.560 --> 1:52:07.720]  set up and sucked in. But the deeper he gets sucked into this, it's a major setup. In the
[1:52:07.720 --> 1:52:11.960]  time we have left, the rest of this segment, one more short segment with you, what do you
[1:52:11.960 --> 1:52:15.960]  predict for next year? I mean, clearly, they're lining up. They're saying, Trump supporters
[1:52:15.960 --> 1:52:20.160]  are going to launch terror attacks. The CIA is globalist control. They're wanting all
[1:52:20.160 --> 1:52:25.320]  this. They're trying to divide and conquer us along all lines. In fact, I was intending
[1:52:25.320 --> 1:52:30.040]  today that was on my heart to bring up how they're trying to divide Christian from Jew
[1:52:30.040 --> 1:52:32.520]  and to get your take. But I didn't want to bring that up. And then you brought it up
[1:52:32.520 --> 1:52:36.640]  yourself. Clearly, we're all God's children. We all have God consciousness. If we choose
[1:52:36.640 --> 1:52:41.400]  it, they're trying to play us off against each other. We have to transcend that in my
[1:52:41.400 --> 1:52:46.400]  mind or in my spirit, or we're going to fail because clearly they're going to use division
[1:52:46.400 --> 1:52:49.680]  going into the future along race and religion to control us.
[1:52:49.680 --> 1:52:56.160]  Listen, I've been pretty savvy and I know, listen, I love you, Alex. You should know
[1:52:56.160 --> 1:53:01.800]  I consider you a brother. A lot of some of the people that listen to you have an interesting
[1:53:01.800 --> 1:53:08.000]  view on Jews. But I'm going to say something about my own religion and about my own religious
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:15.680]  institutions. And to the anti-Semites that are going to use these words, F you, okay,
[1:53:15.680 --> 1:53:20.000]  why don't you look into your own organizations and religious structures and refine them.
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:26.640]  But I would say in my own religion, it's the organizations that are the problem. They've
[1:53:26.640 --> 1:53:34.640]  been corrupted by the serpent and have preached anything but God's consciousness and are
[1:53:34.640 --> 1:53:39.280]  coercing people. I know synagogue, you can't go into a synagogue unless you show proof
[1:53:39.280 --> 1:53:47.440]  of vaccination. I mean, this is the perversion of a relationship with the divine. And so,
[1:53:47.440 --> 1:53:52.520]  and I see that in other religions as well, but I don't want to talk about other religions.
[1:53:52.520 --> 1:53:58.560]  I want to talk about my own. And I'm calling out my own people, start living by the law
[1:53:58.560 --> 1:54:05.440]  and stop getting on your knees and sucking up to the corrupt government and selling
[1:54:05.440 --> 1:54:10.720]  out the congregants and the people that have put their trust in you to help them connect
[1:54:10.720 --> 1:54:14.560]  to God. Anyway, that's my commentary on the religion.
[1:54:14.560 --> 1:54:18.080]  And I was like, oh, I love you too, because I know you have God consciousness. My spirit
[1:54:18.080 --> 1:54:22.960]  feels really great when I talk to you. I love you too. Exactly. They have groups that have
[1:54:22.960 --> 1:54:27.800]  been divided and manipulated. And if you look at the anti-Jewish groups, they're being manipulated.
[1:54:27.800 --> 1:54:30.920]  If you look at the Jewish supremacist groups, they've been manipulated. The black supremacist
[1:54:30.920 --> 1:54:35.840]  groups, all of it's stupid. There's an evil manipulating us against each other and we have
[1:54:35.840 --> 1:54:41.600]  to transcend it or it's going to win. It's very simple and God's watching.
[1:54:41.600 --> 1:54:49.000]  Because only when we're divided and have strife amongst us that the enemy could then pick
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:55.880]  us off in segment. But if we are truly united by an overwhelming principle that transcends
[1:54:55.880 --> 1:55:00.040]  religion, which is actually a relationship with God, with the divine, who are made in
[1:55:00.040 --> 1:55:04.920]  his image, our lives have sanctity, that's enough for me to call you a brother or sister.
[1:55:04.920 --> 1:55:12.280]  That's it. And if we unite, and I want to tell you something, no one owns God. When the Messiah
[1:55:12.280 --> 1:55:16.920]  reveals himself, and I don't care if it's the first, second, or third coming, but whenever
[1:55:16.920 --> 1:55:21.200]  the Messiah reveals himself and the truth of the divine is revealed, I could promise
[1:55:21.200 --> 1:55:27.560]  you my perception of the divine will be wrong. And so will everyone else's because the essence
[1:55:27.560 --> 1:55:33.880]  of God is truly hidden. And hopefully we will see the truth and understand the truth of
[1:55:33.880 --> 1:55:38.640]  what he is. But right now we're living in the dark and we're trying to approximate,
[1:55:38.640 --> 1:55:40.520]  guesstimate what he really is.
[1:55:40.520 --> 1:55:44.720]  No, I totally agree. And the New World Order and Klaus Schwab are afraid of the coming
[1:55:44.720 --> 1:55:49.800]  of the Messiah. Everything they're doing is to stop the next level.
[1:55:49.800 --> 1:55:53.240]  Because it's the death of them. Darkness goes away. You just turn on a little light and
[1:55:53.240 --> 1:55:58.240]  it goes away. And so they know that. They've dug in because they're cornered animals. That's
[1:55:58.240 --> 1:56:02.960]  when they become dangerous. So you're asking about what else they can do next. Listen, I
[1:56:02.960 --> 1:56:09.280]  have some intelligence assets as you do. And some of the options are pretty unpleasant,
[1:56:09.280 --> 1:56:15.280]  whether it's another bioterrorism attack like the smallpox or mob or virus, or other
[1:56:15.280 --> 1:56:21.640]  weapons of mass destruction that can cause further destabilization. And these people
[1:56:21.640 --> 1:56:31.280]  have no problem wasting away billions of people. But the reality is I don't worry about that.
[1:56:31.280 --> 1:56:37.480]  And I have no promises or guarantees to myself or to anyone else that you rise up and storm
[1:56:37.480 --> 1:56:41.000]  the beaches of Normandy of this generation that you'll survive, especially in the first
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:46.360]  wave. There's a very good chance that you may fall. But so what? You know, this is a
[1:56:46.360 --> 1:56:51.000]  finite life, but you have an opportunity now to connect with the infinite then, the eternal,
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  and you have to fall in battle. This is a hill we're dying on. And so it takes courage.
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:01.320]  We grow up with some degree of freedom, not because of us, but because our parents and
[1:57:01.320 --> 1:57:05.920]  grandparents support for it. The question is, will our kids be free? Well, the answer is,
[1:57:05.920 --> 1:57:07.920]  are we ready to fight for it? Are we ready to fight for it?
[1:57:07.920 --> 1:57:14.600]  We're living off gas they put in the tank. So how about next generation, our kids? I
[1:57:14.600 --> 1:57:19.440]  hope they grow up with the ability to thrive in the society of God consciousness. But it
[1:57:19.440 --> 1:57:23.520]  depends on, are we ready to create the environment for that to happen?
[1:57:23.520 --> 1:57:28.120]  Stay there one more segment, Dr. Zalinko. You're absolutely right. The catalyst is here to go
[1:57:28.120 --> 1:57:31.960]  to the next level. We have to decide whether we're going to do it or not. Dr. Zalinko is
[1:57:31.960 --> 1:57:35.400]  our guest. We're going to come back in the final segment with him. Most powerful interview
[1:57:35.400 --> 1:57:38.840]  yet. Wow. And I'm not kidding. I woke up this morning. I had a dream about him. Couldn't
[1:57:38.840 --> 1:57:41.960]  remember what it was. I'm like, get Zalinko on. Usually he can't come on short notice.
[1:57:41.960 --> 1:57:49.040]  He could today. So this is meant to happen. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:57:49.040 --> 1:57:52.960]  Since the end of World War II, the globalists have been building their private corporate
[1:57:52.960 --> 1:57:58.040]  world government whose end game, once they get control, is forced depopulation of the
[1:57:58.040 --> 1:58:03.400]  planet. That's why as we begin to leave the year 2021 and go into 2022, I am encouraging
[1:58:03.400 --> 1:58:07.120]  all of you out there watching and listening to count the cost and to realize how much
[1:58:07.120 --> 1:58:12.000]  danger you and your family are in. The globalists are coming after everybody. They are setting
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:19.000]  up a dystopic planetary authoritarian technocracy, a dictatorship of the globalist. Ladies and
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  gentlemen, Info Wars is the tip of the spear. Your investment in us over the years, buying
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:26.560]  our products, spreading the word and praying for us has been incredible. But I'm telling
[1:58:26.560 --> 1:58:30.680]  you right now, we're about to lose not just Info Wars, but the entire country and the
[1:58:30.680 --> 1:58:35.360]  world of tyranny. So now everything you've done in the past needs to be redoubled today.
[1:58:35.360 --> 1:58:39.720]  And infowarstore.com is one of the most important places you can go to buy great products and
[1:58:39.720 --> 1:58:43.120]  fund the tip of the spear. I will go down with the ship. I'm not going to back down.
[1:58:43.120 --> 1:58:46.640]  I'm getting even more hardcore in their face, but I can't stand the fight at 100% unless
[1:58:46.640 --> 1:58:52.040]  you support us. So please go to infowarstore.com. It's hard to believe that Christmas 2021 is
[1:58:52.040 --> 1:59:00.600]  this year and soon will be in the year 2022. Everything the globalists plan on doing, their
[1:59:00.600 --> 1:59:08.640]  entire operations hinge on you psychologically, not understanding that they're trying to break
[1:59:08.640 --> 1:59:14.800]  your will, that they're trying to drive you into submission. But if you're aware of this
[1:59:14.800 --> 1:59:21.920]  basic fact and how they are scientifically controlling you, then you're basically immune.
[1:59:21.920 --> 1:59:27.080]  This is next level information on how to take control of your mind. It's how I've been able
[1:59:27.080 --> 1:59:31.880]  to stand against the incredible attacks they've carried out because I'm able to connect to
[1:59:31.880 --> 1:59:38.080]  the divine. I'm able to transcend this dimension simply by becoming aware of the fact that
[1:59:38.080 --> 1:59:44.120]  I already transcended it. So until Christmas day, we're offering reset wars, our incredible
[1:59:44.120 --> 1:59:53.400]  two part course for 25% off at resetwars.com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the
[1:59:53.400 --> 2:00:14.080]  New World Order. It's Alex Jones. One fourth of humanity must be eliminated from the social
[2:00:14.080 --> 2:00:18.680]  body. We are in charge of God's selection process for Earth. He selects we destroy.
[2:00:18.680 --> 2:00:24.400]  We are the riders of the pale horse death. I remember 25 years ago I read that quote
[2:00:24.400 --> 2:00:29.240]  and I went to the library and checked it out and it was real. And that's one of the top
[2:00:29.240 --> 2:00:34.480]  UN advisors. By the way, we should plug this. I haven't plugged any. Dr. Zalinka was doing
[2:00:34.480 --> 2:00:38.040]  such important work. He's got probably the best supplement out there with all the things
[2:00:38.040 --> 2:00:41.960]  fused into it for what you need for your body's immune system and more. You're insane, I think

[2:01:25.960 --> 2:01:30.840]  you so much. We have a great holiday coming up in a wonderful new year and we hope to
[2:01:30.840 --> 2:01:33.920]  be able to talk to you obviously next year. But in the last three and a half minutes
[2:01:33.920 --> 2:01:37.480]  we have what else would you like to impart to the viewers and listeners?
[2:01:37.480 --> 2:01:43.200]  But first of all, I want to wish everyone Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas, Happy New
[2:01:43.200 --> 2:01:50.160]  Year and my blessing to all people, to all decent people at least, that you should have
[2:01:50.160 --> 2:01:57.000]  long life and good health and material and spiritual prosperity and true inner peace
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:03.800]  and tranquility and appreciate just being you know it's one thing living with a serious
[2:02:03.800 --> 2:02:10.000]  illness, you learn to appreciate the moment and not take it for granted. And interesting
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:16.520]  and we spoke about this Alex that in the midst of all this chaos, I found the most serenity
[2:02:16.520 --> 2:02:22.160]  in my life than I've ever had. And I think it's certain is a tonic saying that there's
[2:02:22.160 --> 2:02:28.000]  no joy like the resolution of doubt. And since I have no doubt what reality is, and I live
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:33.640]  within the reality, it's ugly, I know that I see it. But nevertheless, I see the truth.
[2:02:33.640 --> 2:02:44.080]  And feel I know how my life fits in into that process as an inner sense of clarity and purpose.
[2:02:44.080 --> 2:02:49.480]  And when I'm aligned with that, I feel the most internal, let's say emotional and intellectual
[2:02:49.480 --> 2:02:54.640]  and spiritual tranquility. And that's very interesting. And I physically feel better
[2:02:54.640 --> 2:02:59.520]  now than I've ever felt. And so I don't know what God's plan is for me. It's like this
[2:02:59.520 --> 2:03:08.880]  divine wave. But clearly, it is to publicize the following idea that he's one. He's good.
[2:03:08.880 --> 2:03:14.700]  He makes us every instant time. He loves us. And he gives us consciousness. And he gives
[2:03:14.700 --> 2:03:19.040]  us free choice and really only he has free choice, right? No one makes him do anything.
[2:03:19.040 --> 2:03:26.240]  And yet he gives us that power. And that power is so amazing. But it's real. And we have
[2:03:26.240 --> 2:03:30.840]  to choose well, we have to turn away from bad and do good. And so it's really up to
[2:03:30.840 --> 2:03:38.560]  us. There's a parable to describe the essence of evil. And it's a, you have a king and he
[2:03:38.560 --> 2:03:43.960]  has a son, the prince is going to be King one day. And he loves his people and he loves
[2:03:43.960 --> 2:03:49.760]  his son. So he wants to make sure that the son is worthy of being King one day. He goes
[2:03:49.760 --> 2:03:55.520]  to a prostitute, the harlot hires her and sends her to seduce his son, the prince. That's
[2:03:55.520 --> 2:04:00.280]  the story. So let's analyze it. Does the king want the son to sin? No, I mean, he's actually
[2:04:00.280 --> 2:04:05.000]  just testing the son to make sure that he has the fiber, the moral fiber to be a good
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:10.480]  king. The prostitute, does she want the son to sin? Actually, think about it, she's doing
[2:04:10.480 --> 2:04:15.920]  the will of the king, isn't she? And so in this particular, that's how I conceptualize
[2:04:15.920 --> 2:04:20.320]  God making free choice. He gives options. If I give you a hundred dollar bill and a dollar
[2:04:20.320 --> 2:04:24.960]  bill, I ask you to choose. That's not much of a choice, right? So you need comparable
[2:04:24.960 --> 2:04:30.040]  options for the choice to be real. So God makes good and evil and they seem equally
[2:04:30.040 --> 2:04:35.440]  attractive and waits for our choices. Now, if we choose evil, it's like me giving you
[2:04:35.440 --> 2:04:39.200]  a beautiful piece of crystal, you drop it on the floor and then cut your foot and you're
[2:04:39.200 --> 2:04:43.280]  bleeding. Was it my fault that you're bleeding? Or perhaps you should have been a little bit
[2:04:43.280 --> 2:04:44.280]  more careful.
[2:04:44.280 --> 2:04:47.680]  Now, beautifully said, Dr. Zalinko, hopefully we get to talk to you in the new year. Thank
[2:04:47.680 --> 2:04:52.160]  you so much. People can find more information right now at ZStackLife.com forward slash
[2:04:52.160 --> 2:04:55.280]  Alex God bless you, sir. And we really appreciate you.
[2:04:55.280 --> 2:04:58.840]  God bless you.
[2:04:58.840 --> 2:05:03.480]  Not just across the United States, but across the world. You see it on the sides of barns
[2:05:03.480 --> 2:05:08.120]  and on bumper stickers on cars and written on the side of bathroom walls. Alex Jones
[2:05:08.120 --> 2:05:13.320]  was right. That's become a maximum of people to communicate to others that they see through
[2:05:13.320 --> 2:05:17.080]  the fraud of the new world order that they're saying no to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates and
[2:05:17.080 --> 2:05:22.680]  the Great Reset. And so now InfoWars credibility is stronger than it's ever been. And the globalist
[2:05:22.680 --> 2:05:26.760]  are now coming to try to shut us down after all their other attacks and we can't let them
[2:05:26.760 --> 2:05:27.760]  do that.
[2:05:27.760 --> 2:05:32.040]  So you've invested in InfoWars over the years. I'm asking you to redouble those efforts
[2:05:32.040 --> 2:05:37.520]  now at this critical juncture or everything you've done in the past is for nothing. You
[2:05:37.520 --> 2:05:42.520]  have invested in justice and the truth and hardcore populace. You have done incredible
[2:05:42.520 --> 2:05:48.640]  things. And I'm telling you now, going in 2022, InfoWars has major underages to run
[2:05:48.640 --> 2:05:53.160]  an operation and we need more funds in. So it's a 360 win. Get great products that are
[2:05:53.160 --> 2:06:10.520]  great for you and your family, your immune system and so much more. So please go to
[2:06:10.520 --> 2:06:25.920]  the show. So when your government scientists tell you that a variant that's 0.3% different
[2:06:25.920 --> 2:06:31.720]  from SARS could masquerade as a new virus and be a threat to your health, you should
[2:06:31.720 --> 2:06:39.400]  know and I'm telling you they are lying. If they're lying and they are, why is the
[2:06:39.400 --> 2:06:45.640]  pharmaceutical industry making top up vaccines? They are making them. You should be terrified
[2:06:45.640 --> 2:06:53.520]  at this point as I am because there's absolutely no possible justification for their manufacture.
[2:06:53.520 --> 2:06:58.120]  But they're being made and the world's medicines regulators have said because they're quite similar
[2:06:58.120 --> 2:07:03.000]  to the original vaccines, the ones that are being given now, we won't be asking them to
[2:07:03.000 --> 2:07:08.020]  do any clinical safety studies. So let me just say again, the variants are not different
[2:07:08.020 --> 2:07:12.440]  enough to represent a threat to you. So you do not need to top up vaccines yet. They are
[2:07:12.440 --> 2:07:18.200]  being made and the regulators have more or less waved them through. I'm very frightened
[2:07:18.200 --> 2:07:24.520]  of that. There's no possible benign interpretation of this. I believe that they're going to be
[2:07:24.520 --> 2:07:31.120]  used to damage your health and possibly kill you. Seriously. I can see no sensible interpretation
[2:07:31.120 --> 2:07:38.600]  other than a serious attempt at mass depopulation. This will provide the tools to do it and plausible
[2:07:38.600 --> 2:07:44.160]  deniability because they'll create another story about some sort of biological threat
[2:07:44.160 --> 2:07:48.560]  and you'll line up and get your top up vaccines in a few months or a year or so later. You'll
[2:07:48.560 --> 2:07:54.080]  die of some, you know, peculiar, explicable syndrome and they won't be able to associate
[2:07:54.080 --> 2:07:58.720]  it with the top up vaccines. But that's my belief that they're lying to you about variants
[2:07:58.720 --> 2:08:05.040]  so they can make damaging top up vaccines that you don't need at all. And I think they'll
[2:08:05.040 --> 2:08:09.560]  be used for malign purposes. And if you don't wake up, that's what's going to happen. I
[2:08:09.560 --> 2:08:14.240]  think during next year.
[2:08:14.240 --> 2:08:20.720]  And he said that nine months ago. Alison Steinberg, who put out a viral video tens of millions
[2:08:20.720 --> 2:08:24.400]  of views everywhere, saying, listen, I've been a supporter of Trump. She's been a guest
[2:08:24.400 --> 2:08:29.280]  on that one short before. But now this is her. This is her Rubicon. This is her line
[2:08:29.280 --> 2:08:33.480]  of the sand. Here she was a few days ago. I'm going to talk to her live today.
[2:08:33.480 --> 2:08:37.640]  All right, guys, I know this is probably going to be an unpopular opinion and it truly does
[2:08:37.640 --> 2:08:43.560]  pay me to say it. But Donald Trump, he is now trying to say that by us doubting the
[2:08:43.560 --> 2:08:49.400]  job that we're playing right into their hands, what all we care about is exposing and knowing
[2:08:49.400 --> 2:08:55.440]  the truth. And he's going to sit here and continuously lie to us to push this bull
[2:08:55.440 --> 2:09:00.280]  narrative and the product that he wants to take full credit for. Do you guys not see
[2:09:00.280 --> 2:09:05.640]  the problem with this? I mean, if he truly cared about saving what whatever's left of
[2:09:05.640 --> 2:09:11.320]  this country, and if he truly cared about you, then he should be more concerned about exposing
[2:09:11.320 --> 2:09:16.400]  the overwhelming number of adverse reactions and deaths from the job. But no, he continues
[2:09:16.400 --> 2:09:21.400]  to rally people up and to see people into thinking that this is somehow good. Not to
[2:09:21.400 --> 2:09:24.840]  mention he's now claiming that he got the booster, which I don't know if that's true
[2:09:24.840 --> 2:09:29.720]  or not. But regardless, why is he still touting this product that's killing people? I don't
[2:09:29.720 --> 2:09:35.240]  care if you're left or right. These are wings of the same evil bird. And we have to remember
[2:09:35.240 --> 2:09:41.640]  that the whole goal is depopulation by shooting you up with their experimental poison. And
[2:09:41.640 --> 2:09:45.120]  a lot of you are probably going to say, oh, well, I don't care what he does because this
[2:09:45.120 --> 2:09:50.680]  is about medical freedom. As long as we have the choice, he's not even giving you the choice.
[2:09:50.680 --> 2:09:55.240]  If you go to his hotel in New York, you have to show proof of papers. So how can you continue
[2:09:55.240 --> 2:10:00.240]  to blindly defend this man? I don't get it. Make it make sense, please. Trump do some
[2:10:00.240 --> 2:10:06.280]  great things while in office. Absolutely. Was I a supporter? I was a huge one. But there
[2:10:06.280 --> 2:10:13.320]  was no denying that what he is doing is evil. And if we continue to just support someone
[2:10:13.320 --> 2:10:18.200]  that does not have our best interest, then that makes us no better than the left. We
[2:10:18.200 --> 2:10:23.000]  have to be willing to come out and state when there's a problem. And I personally think
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:27.400]  that there is a huge problem. So it's time to stop trusting the plan. It's time to wake
[2:10:27.400 --> 2:10:35.880]  the up because nobody is coming to save you. And this is 100% on us. Wow, Allison Steinberg.
[2:10:35.880 --> 2:10:39.520]  She needs to be the next female president of states. Wow, I'm sold. I've seen her on
[2:10:39.520 --> 2:10:47.480]  O and big fan of her work. She is at Allison Wonderland forever. And we breezeway.com.
[2:10:47.480 --> 2:10:52.320]  Allison Steinberg, thank you for joining us on such short notice. When I saw the video
[2:10:52.320 --> 2:10:55.920]  on Twitter with millions of views, it didn't say your name. Like, she looks familiar. Who
[2:10:55.920 --> 2:10:59.720]  is she? Oh, you've been on O and show a few times and I've watched you. So it's great
[2:10:59.720 --> 2:11:06.720]  to have you here. But wow, crazy times. Where do you want to start off? Thank you so much,
[2:11:06.720 --> 2:11:10.280]  Alex, for having me. It's such an honor to be on the show. I can't thank you enough
[2:11:10.280 --> 2:11:15.680]  for having me here. And I just am so grateful for everything that you're doing because there's
[2:11:15.680 --> 2:11:26.520]  so few people that are willing to really speak the truth. And I'm kind of proud of what's
[2:11:26.520 --> 2:11:35.640]  really happening. And it's, hold on, hold on, folks. No big deal. You know, the magic, it's
[2:11:35.640 --> 2:11:39.480]  like Star Trek. We talk to somebody via Skype or Zoom. And then sometimes there's a problem
[2:11:39.480 --> 2:11:42.680]  with Murphy's Law. We're going to see if it stabilizes and go back to her. No need to
[2:11:42.680 --> 2:11:49.800]  thank me. We're very thankful to Allison Steinberg at Allison Wonderland forever for what she's
[2:11:49.800 --> 2:11:54.040]  doing speaking out. And we're not trying to attack Trump, but he's destroying himself.
[2:11:54.040 --> 2:11:59.720]  He's going down this avenue. Sorry, you got cut off there. What were you trying to say?
[2:11:59.720 --> 2:12:07.200]  Hi, can you hear me now? We're just saying you just got cut off after saying you were
[2:12:07.200 --> 2:12:10.920]  honored to be on the show. We're honored to have you. Wow, this thing's gone super viral.
[2:12:10.920 --> 2:12:20.640]  You've done a lot of viral stuff, but this is gone super viral. Here's what we're going
[2:12:20.640 --> 2:12:23.720]  to do. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to get her on the phone and with the
[2:12:23.720 --> 2:12:28.160]  video, so it'll all be good. That's the fun of these shows, though. So I used to have
[2:12:28.160 --> 2:12:32.400]  Michael Savage on before he basically retired. He said, it's okay if you have technical difficulties
[2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:36.600]  sometime. It's like when he was a kid growing up in New York City and they'd watch like
[2:12:36.600 --> 2:12:40.000]  Mexican TV that were, you know, the local Mexicans doing the show like puppets beating
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:43.680]  each other up the head. And then it'd be like a curtain falls down. You see the stuff going
[2:12:43.680 --> 2:12:48.360]  on or you'd watch the local access TV magician and you know, this hat would catch on fire
[2:12:48.360 --> 2:12:53.080]  by accident. That's what's fun about all this. So we're going to talk a few minutes here
[2:12:53.080 --> 2:12:58.080]  and get Allison Steinberg on via phone and video so we can talk to her. Allison, wonder
[2:12:58.080 --> 2:13:03.360]  land forever on Twitter. She is amazing. Of course, it's my show where it has technical
[2:13:03.360 --> 2:13:07.280]  stuff on Owens. It's crystal clear. Oh, and by the way, it's coming up at 3pm central
[2:13:07.280 --> 2:13:16.640]  today. But here we are two hours and 13 minutes into this transmission into this broadcast
[2:13:16.640 --> 2:13:21.720]  that I have not plugged today. And I'm the guy that needs to plug to fund our operations.
[2:13:21.720 --> 2:13:25.320]  So I want to thank you all for your support. I want to encourage you, even though if you
[2:13:25.320 --> 2:13:28.480]  order something now, you're not going to get it by Christmas, obviously, but it doesn't
[2:13:28.480 --> 2:13:32.360]  matter. Give yourself the Christmas gift of vitamin mineral fusion, all the vitamins,
[2:13:32.360 --> 2:13:37.000]  all the minerals, all the amino acids in a liquid form to absorb it better. It is still
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:40.880]  discounted 40% off with free shipping, even though it's about to sell out. Same thing
[2:13:40.880 --> 2:13:48.440]  for DNA Force Plus. Same thing for prostagard 50% off. Same thing for things like body's
[2:13:48.440 --> 2:13:53.960]  ultimate turmeric formula, which is 50% off right now. All of it is massively discounted.
[2:13:53.960 --> 2:13:57.640]  Best sales of the year are always in Christmas at the end of the year. So take advantage
[2:13:57.640 --> 2:14:02.400]  of the best deals of the year on ultimate bone broth, on green fiber, on winter sun,
[2:14:02.400 --> 2:14:10.640]  on ultra 12, on liquid turmeric formula. It's all record deals right now at infowarstore.com

[2:14:26.880 --> 2:14:31.520]  down. It's all documented. We have equations, everything about how Elon Musk has lately
[2:14:31.520 --> 2:14:35.440]  been talking about it, how they program you with these false programs. How do you get
[2:14:35.440 --> 2:14:40.560]  those programs off by becoming aware of them? So is our program perfect? No, it's a human
[2:14:40.560 --> 2:14:44.960]  attempt to look at how this is happening in the third dimension of beyond resetwars.com.

[2:17:30.680 --> 2:17:37.560]  I take that B12 and I'm electric man. I can run 10 miles. I did some pretty heavy work
[2:17:37.560 --> 2:17:42.800]  with the highway department and my friends will attest to the fact that yeah, for a guy
[2:17:42.800 --> 2:17:49.360]  in his 60s, you know, pushing 70, I'm not just blowing smoke here. The B12 saves my
[2:17:49.360 --> 2:18:04.280]  life. In late August, info wars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[2:18:04.280 --> 2:18:10.680]  that the globalist are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[2:18:10.680 --> 2:18:15.880]  and financial collapse worldwide. Now, ladies and gentlemen, storeable food has always been

[2:19:59.400 --> 2:20:09.400]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[2:20:09.400 --> 2:20:19.120]  Well, her video has gone super viral. Alison Steinberg and Alison wonderland forever. What
[2:20:19.120 --> 2:20:24.680]  a great name. She joins us here. She's joined info wars on Owen show before. Great to have
[2:20:24.680 --> 2:20:29.440]  her on Weathers to give her take on what she says is a betrayal by President Trump. He's
[2:20:29.440 --> 2:20:33.320]  now doubled down with Candace Owens. Today, a clip of that's coming up next segment. He
[2:20:33.320 --> 2:20:37.840]  says everybody dying hasn't had the shot. That's a total lie of Fauci. That's coming
[2:20:37.840 --> 2:20:42.400]  up, but this is a very sad moment. And why are you so concerned, Alison? As you put
[2:20:42.400 --> 2:20:46.360]  out that amazingly articulate video, but I want you to be able to elaborate. Thank you
[2:20:46.360 --> 2:20:50.880]  so much for joining us. Thank you again for having me. Alex, it's an
[2:20:50.880 --> 2:20:57.240]  honor to be here. It is extremely upsetting because I have been such a huge supporter
[2:20:57.240 --> 2:21:00.760]  of Trump all this time, and I really wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt, as I
[2:21:00.760 --> 2:21:07.040]  think so many other people did. And we seem to have made excuses for him for a long time,
[2:21:07.040 --> 2:21:11.920]  despite having this obvious evidence right in front of us. We just hoped that things
[2:21:11.920 --> 2:21:17.360]  would pan out and we would see the results that we needed for him. But now he's sitting
[2:21:17.360 --> 2:21:24.760]  here continuously backing Big Pharma and continuously begging for the attention of his supporters
[2:21:24.760 --> 2:21:30.160]  and wanting all of this credit for something that we know is evil and is a bio weapon.
[2:21:30.160 --> 2:21:34.960]  So if he's not willing to speak out openly about it, if he's not willing to come clean
[2:21:34.960 --> 2:21:40.640]  about what's really going on here and now blame us for overwhelming the hospitals, then
[2:21:40.640 --> 2:21:44.080]  I think we have a real issue here. And I think more people need to be open to that and wake
[2:21:44.080 --> 2:21:47.520]  up to the fact that he is not actually on our side anymore.
[2:21:47.520 --> 2:21:52.680]  I have to agree. I mean, do you think he's being blackmailed or is he being picketed?
[2:21:52.680 --> 2:21:54.160]  What do you think is happening?
[2:21:54.160 --> 2:21:59.240]  Yeah, I would imagine there's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes that we obviously
[2:21:59.240 --> 2:22:04.040]  don't know about. But at a certain point when people are dying and people are losing their
[2:22:04.040 --> 2:22:08.720]  jobs left and right and people no longer have a way of making a living or bringing money
[2:22:08.720 --> 2:22:15.680]  into their family, then you can't continuously back this product that's killing people and
[2:22:15.680 --> 2:22:23.480]  ruining lives. I don't know how anyone with a heart could continue down this path.
[2:22:23.480 --> 2:22:27.600]  I agree with you. And he's also letting people rot in jail and I'm making a big enough deal
[2:22:27.600 --> 2:22:31.840]  about the Q shaman. And you know, stuff like that.
[2:22:31.840 --> 2:22:36.200]  I know. What about all of those January six political prisoners? Where is he on that?
[2:22:36.200 --> 2:22:40.840]  I mean, we came there in support of him. We came there to defend him. We came there in
[2:22:40.840 --> 2:22:46.880]  the name of freedom and and he won't even, you know, help us out or there's people rotting
[2:22:46.880 --> 2:22:51.560]  away in prison. And he has no comment on that. So it's extremely upsetting.
[2:22:51.560 --> 2:22:54.840]  And I want to be a million percent clear. I'm not trying to curry favor with the Jan
[2:22:54.840 --> 2:22:59.440]  six committee. I told them go to hell or the Democrats. I hope they burn in hell. It's
[2:22:59.440 --> 2:23:05.080]  that it's watching Trump join them and Biden defend them. It's just it's too much. Everybody
[2:23:05.080 --> 2:23:10.640]  I know that uses support. Trump is really mad at him. He's really basically committing
[2:23:10.640 --> 2:23:16.080]  political suicide in front of us. All of you. He is. I agree with that. And but to me, what's
[2:23:16.080 --> 2:23:20.880]  that is that now I'm personally experiencing a lot of attacks from people who are supposedly
[2:23:20.880 --> 2:23:24.960]  on our side that I should ask you that question. I'm not a good interviewer. Well, what's been
[2:23:24.960 --> 2:23:29.840]  the response since you put out this video that's gone super viral?
[2:23:29.840 --> 2:23:34.280]  It's been a very mixed bag. Obviously, the liberals are having a heyday with it because
[2:23:34.280 --> 2:23:39.400]  they think that, oh, look, there, you know, Trump is is turning on his own supporters.
[2:23:39.400 --> 2:23:44.480]  This and that, which is ridiculous. They can't comprehend that we can form our own thoughts
[2:23:44.480 --> 2:23:47.960]  and opinions and we're not just going to blindly go along with whatever he says. But with that
[2:23:47.960 --> 2:23:52.920]  being said, then the more concerning issue is on the right, where so many people continue
[2:23:52.920 --> 2:23:58.120]  to defend him and make excuses and come up with these ridiculous reverse psychology tactics
[2:23:58.120 --> 2:24:04.120]  and 5D checks, you know, scenarios in which they think that he's actually doing good when
[2:24:04.120 --> 2:24:09.480]  he's now outright stating that we are the problem. So I don't know how people can, you
[2:24:09.480 --> 2:24:14.600]  know, turn on me or like the people who are truly fighting for freedom, the real Patriots
[2:24:14.600 --> 2:24:20.440]  here, they turn around and completely treat us like leftists by saying that we are shills
[2:24:20.440 --> 2:24:24.520]  and we are part of the problem and how dare we not trust Trump. And it's just upsetting
[2:24:24.520 --> 2:24:28.440]  to see because I feel like the whole goal is to divide us. And now there's further division
[2:24:28.440 --> 2:24:33.480]  within our own community of people. Well, that's why you're here. You say it better
[2:24:33.480 --> 2:24:39.320]  than I do. You really need a major talk show. Alison Steinberg, where do you expect us to
[2:24:39.320 --> 2:24:44.160]  go? Because even Jack Busovic says he thinks Trump's being set up by the left with his
[2:24:44.160 --> 2:24:51.200]  defense of this so-called vaccine. I don't even know what's going to happen. It's a
[2:24:51.200 --> 2:24:55.760]  very scary time. And unless everyone truly stands up and fights back and is willing
[2:24:55.760 --> 2:25:00.320]  to resist this, then I don't know what to say because, you know, I'm someone that's
[2:25:00.320 --> 2:25:04.920]  taking this very seriously. I will not miss an opportunity to shed some light on what's
[2:25:04.920 --> 2:25:09.800]  happening. And it even goes down to things like not having a fake card or not getting
[2:25:09.800 --> 2:25:10.800]  yourself into the system.
[2:25:10.800 --> 2:25:15.520]  I feel like a lot of these so-called conservatives are actually quite weak and they're willing
[2:25:15.520 --> 2:25:19.480]  to just slide through the cracks so that their life can stay easy. They're not really willing
[2:25:19.480 --> 2:25:23.480]  to fight for freedom. And that's what we need. We need real freedom fighters. And unless
[2:25:23.480 --> 2:25:26.640]  everyone gets on board with that, then you're ultimately just going to become a part of
[2:25:26.640 --> 2:25:28.440]  the system. And we can't have that.
[2:25:28.440 --> 2:25:32.040]  Well, Alison, you just knocked it out of the park. I mean, that's what this is. We've
[2:25:32.040 --> 2:25:36.480]  got to get out of our comfort zones and not just go have Republican events where everybody's
[2:25:36.480 --> 2:25:40.880]  a rock star and, oh, look, Carl Rittenhouse comes out on stage. Nothing against that.
[2:25:40.880 --> 2:25:45.520]  But if you're not then saying, let's march, let's go out, let's vote, let's get aggressive,
[2:25:45.520 --> 2:25:49.120]  let's file lawsuits. I mean, if you're not challenging and letting the Republican Party
[2:25:49.120 --> 2:25:53.040]  adopt the globalist agenda, well, then you're just as bad as the enemy.
[2:25:53.040 --> 2:25:58.000]  Exactly. And we're not seeing enough of that. I know there are people who are, you know,
[2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:02.040]  this is the hill that they will die on, but we're not seeing enough pushback from people
[2:26:02.040 --> 2:26:06.480]  on our side. And this is a result of weak leadership. I mean, even Rand Paul wants to
[2:26:06.480 --> 2:26:10.520]  introduce a new vaccine and we don't have people talking about the real issue. I don't
[2:26:10.520 --> 2:26:14.880]  think people are comprehending the fact that this is a bio weapon and they're completely
[2:26:14.880 --> 2:26:18.640]  overlooking the fact that the New World Order is here and this is what they're using to
[2:26:18.640 --> 2:26:22.440]  usher it in. So people need to fight like their life literally depends on it because
[2:26:22.440 --> 2:26:24.960]  it does.
[2:26:24.960 --> 2:26:29.200]  So I've asked a lot of questions and I've got plenty of questions, but what else do
[2:26:29.200 --> 2:26:33.240]  you want to get out to the audience here?
[2:26:33.240 --> 2:26:38.800]  I would like to say that people need to stand up and be more hardcore about what they believe
[2:26:38.800 --> 2:26:47.640]  in, stop blindly defending people that don't necessarily have your back. I feel betrayed
[2:26:47.640 --> 2:26:52.360]  by Trump and I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't feel that way at this point. So I think people
[2:26:52.360 --> 2:26:56.560]  just need to be more open-minded and I think ultimately we need to focus on unity because
[2:26:56.560 --> 2:27:00.880]  that's the only way we're going to override this because if we keep fighting within our
[2:27:00.880 --> 2:27:05.280]  little sectors, then we're not going to accomplish anything and it's just going to make it easier
[2:27:05.280 --> 2:27:09.760]  for the enemy to attack. So I just hope that people can be more open-minded. I hope that
[2:27:09.760 --> 2:27:15.200]  people continue to resist and I hope that everyone just sees what's really happening
[2:27:15.200 --> 2:27:19.120]  here. I've been fighting really hard. I go out into the streets and interview people
[2:27:19.120 --> 2:27:24.880]  myself to try to get the public to weigh in and it just seems like a losing battle at
[2:27:24.880 --> 2:27:28.880]  this point because so many people are just already so far gone.
[2:27:28.880 --> 2:27:32.160]  You're out in San Diego, right?
[2:27:32.160 --> 2:27:36.960]  I am in Southern California. I go back and forth between LA and Orange County.
[2:27:36.960 --> 2:27:41.360]  Yeah, I just saw you on a local show. I was guessing that. I mean, that really is a fallen
[2:27:41.360 --> 2:27:44.800]  place. There's so many good people there. That's the paradox, but it's such a beautiful
[2:27:44.800 --> 2:27:50.960]  state too, but I can't say you're wrong. I mean, we are really losing this fight not
[2:27:50.960 --> 2:27:55.520]  because the people aren't supporting freedom, but because they're not fighting for their freedom.
[2:27:55.520 --> 2:27:57.200]  So how do we fight for our freedom?
[2:27:57.200 --> 2:28:04.400]  I think just banding together with community, with your community, finding like-minded people,
[2:28:04.400 --> 2:28:09.200]  people do need to be more open-minded instead of immediately bashing you for having an alternative
[2:28:09.200 --> 2:28:15.200]  thought. I mean, the right criticizes the left for not being open-minded and not being able to
[2:28:15.200 --> 2:28:19.920]  have an opinion and not being able to be our point of view. But now I feel like the right
[2:28:19.920 --> 2:28:25.680]  is treating us the same way and has the same tactics as the left. So people need to be more
[2:28:25.680 --> 2:28:29.680]  accepting of alternative views. Maybe we don't agree on everything, but we need to all come
[2:28:29.680 --> 2:28:35.280]  together. And we also need to focus on having conversations individually. Like a lot of people
[2:28:35.280 --> 2:28:40.240]  like to talk so loud and openly on social media, but where are they when it comes to real life?
[2:28:40.240 --> 2:28:46.480]  They say that they're not going to comply and they say that they're anti-communist and all
[2:28:46.480 --> 2:28:50.560]  this stuff, but then they suddenly have a mask on just to get in to eat.
[2:28:50.560 --> 2:28:53.840]  Well, that's right, but you're putting your money where your mouth is. Alice in Steinberg,
[2:28:53.840 --> 2:28:57.840]  let's come back with this clip. Stay with us.
[2:29:24.160 --> 2:29:28.400]  Technocracy, a dictatorship of the globalist. Ladies and gentlemen,
[2:29:28.400 --> 2:29:32.800]  Info Wars is the tip of the spear. Your investment in us over the years, buying our products,
[2:29:32.800 --> 2:29:36.400]  spreading the word and praying for us has been incredible. But I'm telling you right now,
[2:29:36.400 --> 2:29:40.640]  we're about to lose not just Info Wars, but the entire country and the world of tyranny.
[2:29:40.640 --> 2:29:45.680]  So now everything you've done in the past needs to be redoubled today. And infowarstore.com is one
[2:29:45.680 --> 2:29:49.840]  of the most important places you can go to buy great products and fund the tip of the spear.
[2:29:49.840 --> 2:29:53.440]  I will go down with the ship. I'm not going to back down. I'm getting even more hardcore in their
[2:29:53.440 --> 2:29:57.680]  face, but I can't stay in the fight at 100% unless you support us. So please go to infowarstore.com.
[2:29:57.680 --> 2:30:03.520]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming. They're here all over the world from Australia to the
[2:30:03.520 --> 2:30:08.560]  United States from Canada to Germany. These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go
[2:30:08.560 --> 2:30:14.000]  and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases, actually taking people away into
[2:30:14.000 --> 2:30:18.960]  the night to their facilities. And they're planning in the next year to expand their
[2:30:18.960 --> 2:30:23.600]  shield process where they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities
[2:30:23.600 --> 2:30:28.320]  for their safety. This is nothing less than martial law. And one big thing you can do to fight back
[2:30:28.320 --> 2:30:32.800]  is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very
[2:30:32.800 --> 2:30:39.200]  compliant, meaning US government military grade at infowarstore.com. We have the entire line of
[2:30:39.200 --> 2:30:45.120]  silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit infowarstore.com. Again, we have big backpacks.
[2:30:45.120 --> 2:30:49.680]  We have special dry bags. We've got them for cell phones. We've got them for laptops. We've
[2:30:49.680 --> 2:30:55.680]  got them for iPads. It's all there at infowarstore.com. So protect your privacy today and support the
[2:30:55.680 --> 2:31:03.280]  info war at infowarstore.com. Reset wars.com is the coordinates on the internet where you can
[2:31:03.280 --> 2:31:10.720]  find the most important information I've produced in 28 years on air. A lot of what's in the courses
[2:31:10.720 --> 2:31:16.800]  is known. A lot isn't. But it's my particular perspective and my definitions and my way of
[2:31:16.800 --> 2:31:20.960]  seeing the world. Doesn't mean it's perfectly right. As the Bible says, we all see through a
[2:31:20.960 --> 2:31:27.120]  rose color darkly, but we've proven that we've got some of the clearest cutting edge discernment
[2:31:27.120 --> 2:31:31.920]  out there. And I want you to have access to this information because you need these tools,
[2:31:32.880 --> 2:31:37.120]  in my experience at least, to stand for the globalists and not let them break your will.
[2:31:37.120 --> 2:31:45.600]  And so through Christmas Day, the course is 25% off at resetwars.com. And it's not just an amazing
[2:31:45.600 --> 2:31:51.360]  game changing consciousness raising course. It also funds the info war. So it's a true 360 win.
[2:31:51.360 --> 2:31:56.240]  resetwars.com, Mind Wars Spirit Wars 25% off at resetwars.com.
[2:31:58.240 --> 2:32:04.560]  I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball games. I like going to concerts. I like going
[2:32:04.560 --> 2:32:10.080]  to play golf. I like going out to dinner. I like the metropolitan life. I like everything that
[2:32:10.080 --> 2:32:16.560]  comes with this. But see, I have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of Democrat
[2:32:16.560 --> 2:32:21.760]  run cities, get the hell out of major metropolitan areas. Because unless we change course soon,
[2:32:21.760 --> 2:32:26.400]  it's all crashing down. Is it time to just move out to the woods, just time to go get a piece of
[2:32:26.400 --> 2:32:30.480]  property in the woods, just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the
[2:32:30.480 --> 2:32:34.720]  land. That's the survival instinct. But see the worldly part of me that's still probably the
[2:32:34.720 --> 2:32:39.520]  majority part of me says, no, no, no, no, no, stay in the city. The survival instinct says,
[2:32:39.520 --> 2:32:43.120]  get the hell out of anywhere they've ever noticed that you need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[2:32:43.120 --> 2:32:48.880]  That's the that's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing
[2:32:48.880 --> 2:32:54.560]  as well. But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies. And so
[2:32:54.560 --> 2:33:02.880]  we have the best ones in inforwarstore.com leading up frontal assault on the lies of the new world
[2:33:02.880 --> 2:33:28.480]  order. It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:32.880 --> 2:33:36.480]  The way they were living today.
[2:33:37.920 --> 2:33:51.040]  You talk lots about God. Freedom comes from the car. But that's not why this bitch wants
[2:33:51.040 --> 2:34:00.480]  not what I want at all. I want money, power, and glory.
[2:34:00.480 --> 2:34:05.440]  You can say there's too many people. You can say we need to populate them. Maybe you're right.
[2:34:05.440 --> 2:34:10.720]  But who chooses? And the people running this whole thing are the very worst of us.
[2:34:10.720 --> 2:34:16.880]  They're the ones that should walk the plank first. Show us how to die. Kill yourselves,
[2:34:16.880 --> 2:34:27.200]  Bill Gates, Fauci. Kill yourself. And then we might listen to you. Lead us by example or shut
[2:34:27.200 --> 2:34:35.200]  your filthy inbred mouths up.
[2:34:35.200 --> 2:34:37.200]  You're all going the revstein way.
[2:34:40.480 --> 2:34:43.520]  All right. Joining us via the telephone is Allison Steinberg.
[2:34:44.800 --> 2:34:48.320]  And she's got the best little two-minute rant I've seen exposing this whole damn thing and
[2:34:48.320 --> 2:34:52.720]  everything she does is awesome. Allison, tell me what you do full time. I want to learn more about
[2:34:52.720 --> 2:34:58.320]  you and just what you're up to and just your views on the world and where you think this is all
[2:34:58.320 --> 2:35:02.880]  going because, you know, I don't want to attack Trump. I made major investments in Trump. I got
[2:35:02.880 --> 2:35:08.160]  sued over Trump. I got persecuted. They're trying to put me in prison with the January 6th committee
[2:35:08.160 --> 2:35:14.240]  over Trump. And that's what makes it so bad when you've invested so much in somebody to watch him
[2:35:14.240 --> 2:35:19.120]  go sideways. I've got more anger at him than I got against Hillary Clinton because I know she's evil.
[2:35:19.120 --> 2:35:25.440]  I know she's bad. I know she's forsaken everybody. But with Trump, it's particularly personal.
[2:35:25.440 --> 2:35:31.440]  Is that where this is coming from for you? Because it seemed personal in that beautiful rant you did.
[2:35:32.480 --> 2:35:37.280]  Well, absolutely it's personal because I've dedicated so much of my life to this. I thought
[2:35:37.920 --> 2:35:43.280]  harder for this than anything in my entire life. I've lost friends and family over it. So to
[2:35:43.280 --> 2:35:49.680]  ultimately be betrayed and now left in the dust and just completely on our own to fight for this,
[2:35:49.680 --> 2:35:56.320]  yeah, it's beyond upsetting. So I can't even imagine how you feel. But coming from someone who
[2:35:56.320 --> 2:36:01.680]  has put their life and career on the line for this, I mean, I have no choice but to speak up
[2:36:01.680 --> 2:36:05.280]  about it now. And I would hope that many others would be doing the same because I know I'm not
[2:36:05.280 --> 2:36:11.360]  the only one in this situation. I totally agree. So again, I've always got questions,
[2:36:11.360 --> 2:36:18.560]  but what else is on your amazing radar screen? Well, you asked what I do. I'm a makeup artist
[2:36:18.560 --> 2:36:25.200]  for a living. I have left my job because they wanted to enforce all of these ridiculous mandates.
[2:36:25.200 --> 2:36:30.560]  And so I went out and started doing freelance work on my own, which has been fantastic. But
[2:36:30.560 --> 2:36:36.000]  you know, along with all of the speaking out about my disagreements about everything going on,
[2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:43.520]  I've lost a lot of clients and it does put me at risk for my clients knowing about my stance,
[2:36:43.520 --> 2:36:50.320]  which can obviously get you canceled in today's world. So I just, you know, at this point,
[2:36:50.320 --> 2:36:55.280]  I don't even care. It's not about that. Like I will scrub toilets if I have to,
[2:36:55.280 --> 2:36:59.520]  because at the end of the day, all I care about is truth and exposing that and staying consistent
[2:36:59.520 --> 2:37:05.040]  with that. And I gotta tell you right now, I saw you about a year ago and the other one
[2:37:05.040 --> 2:37:09.280]  or over a year ago and I said, oh, and you need to hire her as a reporter in California.
[2:37:09.920 --> 2:37:13.360]  And, and, and then he's like, yeah, well, she's doing her own thing, but I don't have a bunch
[2:37:13.360 --> 2:37:18.560]  extra money, but I really want to talk to you if you can find a camera person and some work to have
[2:37:18.560 --> 2:37:22.080]  you do interviews and stuff, but also your own rants. Because you're, I mean, I know talent
[2:37:22.080 --> 2:37:25.760]  when I see it, and you're not just a beautiful woman. That's like a side asset. You're really
[2:37:25.760 --> 2:37:29.520]  smart. You should be a pundit. I mean, I'm not trying to knock the other some of the people
[2:37:29.520 --> 2:37:34.080]  on Fox News, but you're a lot smarter than some of the best info babes they've got. And you're
[2:37:34.080 --> 2:37:38.240]  just as smart or smarter than the best men they've got. I mean, everybody can hear her on air. She's
[2:37:38.240 --> 2:37:43.760]  smart as she gets sharp as a dagger here. So we need you in the fight full time. That's all I'm
[2:37:43.760 --> 2:37:50.080]  saying. Alex, that is the biggest honor I could ever imagine. Thank you so much. I would absolutely
[2:37:50.080 --> 2:37:54.640]  love to work for you or do whatever it takes to expose this stuff at the end of the day. That's
[2:37:54.640 --> 2:37:58.800]  like I said, all I care about. And it's my top priority right now. Well, I don't care if you
[2:37:58.800 --> 2:38:04.240]  worked the blaze of a Tucker Carlson or for us, it needs to happen. I mean, I mean, my lord, you
[2:38:04.240 --> 2:38:10.080]  need your own show. You need to be wrecking balling these people every day. I would love nothing
[2:38:10.080 --> 2:38:14.720]  more. I've dedicated so much time to this at this point. I'm just ready to go all in. And
[2:38:15.600 --> 2:38:21.920]  it's very time consuming, as I'm sure you know, and you've dedicated your entire life to it. But
[2:38:21.920 --> 2:38:26.480]  that's all that matters anymore. Because if we don't fight like hell, we won't have anything left
[2:38:26.480 --> 2:38:32.320]  to fight for. So I'm ready to go all in. And whatever opportunity comes my way, I am more than
[2:38:32.320 --> 2:38:36.160]  I think that's beautiful. I mean, you're obviously all in. That's what's so powerful about it.
[2:38:36.160 --> 2:38:40.240]  Because I saw your other interviews, they were powerful, but you were really better than I could
[2:38:40.240 --> 2:38:45.200]  do. You did a better job than I could do in two minutes of just eviscerating Trump. And that's
[2:38:45.200 --> 2:38:50.080]  why so many of his minions got mad at you because they're guilty about the fact that they're still
[2:38:50.080 --> 2:38:53.920]  signed on to Trump. I want to make Trump get back on the straight and narrow. If he isn't going to
[2:38:53.920 --> 2:38:58.000]  get back on the straight and narrow, I mean, I'm sorry, we'll take the good he did is good,
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:01.600]  but we're going to take the bad he did is happening currently. And, you know, we're not
[2:39:01.600 --> 2:39:07.040]  going to be, at least in my view, supporting Trump. Yeah, that's kind of where we're at. And it's
[2:39:07.040 --> 2:39:11.040]  sad that it's hard to come to this, but I don't think we have a choice at this point. Like,
[2:39:11.040 --> 2:39:15.840]  we all know what the end goal is here. So if someone's going to sit there and continuously
[2:39:15.840 --> 2:39:20.080]  defend it when we know what's happening, then it would be wrong of us to do that. That makes
[2:39:20.080 --> 2:39:25.440]  us no better than the liberal. So we have no choice. Well, it's like Tony Montana says in that great
[2:39:26.640 --> 2:39:31.360]  script written by Oliver Stone back in the 80s, the only thing we've got is our word and our
[2:39:31.360 --> 2:39:37.120]  will, our word and our will. And so I'm not breaking it for anybody. And I want Trump to
[2:39:37.120 --> 2:39:42.400]  be good. I want to support Trump. I believed in him, but we can't compromise ourselves because
[2:39:42.400 --> 2:39:49.840]  our previous leader has sold out his ideals. It's that simple. So Trump needs to know that.
[2:39:49.840 --> 2:39:53.920]  Absolutely. And I don't know. I mean, he would think that he would,
[2:39:53.920 --> 2:39:59.840]  seeing as every time he brings the vaccine up at a rally, he gets booed. And now he's just
[2:39:59.840 --> 2:40:05.600]  dismissing it. I mean, at this latest thing, the latest interview, he just booed everyone
[2:40:05.600 --> 2:40:11.920]  and shuts them up. So I think he knows how we feel, but he's just so intent on getting
[2:40:11.920 --> 2:40:16.800]  credit for everything. And he's obviously a bit of a narcissist. So I don't, I don't know where
[2:40:17.360 --> 2:40:21.680]  the issue is here, but you would think that if he really cared about his supporters and the people
[2:40:21.680 --> 2:40:26.400]  that have endlessly defended him, that he would be doing a little bit more to appease us.
[2:40:26.400 --> 2:40:29.120]  Well, you're right. That's the worst part is he points at the crowd and says, oh,
[2:40:29.120 --> 2:40:33.760]  you're a small group building me like, oh, look, there's small. No, it wasn't small.
[2:40:33.760 --> 2:40:39.280]  The majority of Trump supporters see through Fauci, see through Bill Gates, see through Joe
[2:40:39.280 --> 2:40:44.240]  Biden. And now to have Joe Biden defending Trump, does it Trump get that's not good optics,
[2:40:44.240 --> 2:40:48.880]  this guy that stole the election, the guy that has a 20% approval rating? I mean, what the hell's
[2:40:48.880 --> 2:40:55.680]  wrong with Trump? I don't know. I don't know how much more frightening I can get. This is about,
[2:40:56.320 --> 2:41:02.560]  it's close to the, I don't know what more people need to see. If he, if Biden and
[2:41:02.560 --> 2:41:07.040]  Trump are on the same page, then that should be the ultimate red flag. And, and I don't know how
[2:41:07.040 --> 2:41:11.520]  anyone can, can continue to back this or say that there's some strategy behind this, because
[2:41:11.520 --> 2:41:15.440]  at the end of the day, he's telling us everything we need to know. And you either are going to
[2:41:16.720 --> 2:41:22.160]  be willing to accept this unfortunate information, or you're going to keep lying to yourself. And,
[2:41:22.160 --> 2:41:26.320]  and maybe that's the route some people need to take. If you need to pretend that, you know,
[2:41:26.320 --> 2:41:31.520]  there's some hope for you just by blindly believing in Trump. And I guess that's what you have to do
[2:41:31.520 --> 2:41:35.360]  is really sad, but you're not a true fighter. Then you have to be willing to wake up to the
[2:41:35.360 --> 2:41:40.000]  facts and they're sitting here right in front of us now. Well, Allison, I'm no rocket scientist,
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:46.640]  but I'm also not a turnip farmer. And I can tell people clearly all the criminal investigations on
[2:41:46.640 --> 2:41:50.240]  Trump, he said nothing wrong. Clearly have finally gotten to them. Well, they got criminal
[2:41:50.240 --> 2:41:54.960]  investigations open on me. I'm not rolling over. And so what is Trump going to think he's going
[2:41:54.960 --> 2:41:59.040]  to roll over? And then he's going to endorse this. They're going to leave him alone. At the end of
[2:41:59.040 --> 2:42:06.160]  the day, I just can't be part of it anymore. I can't either. The vaccine is where I draw the
[2:42:06.160 --> 2:42:11.520]  line. I've been willing to overlook a lot of, you know, other questionable things from the past,
[2:42:11.520 --> 2:42:15.920]  but I, you know, wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt, but here we are. I can't get behind
[2:42:15.920 --> 2:42:19.600]  the vaccine. We know that it's a bio weapon. We know it's designed to depopulate. We know
[2:42:19.600 --> 2:42:24.400]  how dangerous it is. People are losing their jobs over it. It's disgusting. It's despicable. And
[2:42:24.400 --> 2:42:28.800]  as someone who's pro-America, he should be doing a lot more to fight this and he should be exposing
[2:42:28.800 --> 2:42:33.120]  the truth. If I could figure that out, you're right, Allison. You're right, Allison. It's a very
[2:42:33.120 --> 2:42:37.440]  sad moment to be alive, but in a way it's also a good moment. It's paradoxical as we get to meet
[2:42:37.440 --> 2:42:42.320]  great people like you. We're going to find out who people really are in this day and age in this
[2:42:42.320 --> 2:42:48.320]  incredible time. Final second with Allison Steinberg of Allison Wonderland forever on Twitter
[2:42:48.320 --> 2:42:54.960]  when we come back. And then we've got Kate Dolly taking over in the fourth hour. Stay with us.

[2:44:01.440 --> 2:44:07.360]  very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from
[2:44:07.360 --> 2:44:14.000]  this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com.
[2:44:14.000 --> 2:44:20.240]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure,
[2:44:20.240 --> 2:44:25.680]  decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing
[2:44:25.680 --> 2:44:32.000]  reduction in inflammatory responses and joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have
[2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:38.800]  suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the
[2:44:38.800 --> 2:44:45.840]  concentration and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical
[2:44:45.840 --> 2:44:52.480]  and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for a
[2:44:52.480 --> 2:44:57.040]  friend, family member or yourself at infowarstore.com.

[2:46:02.720 --> 2:46:07.760]  is just a few days away. I want to take a little bit of time out to thank you all for keeping us
[2:46:07.760 --> 2:46:13.680]  in the fight. The New World Order would have already basically won if it wasn't for info wars
[2:46:13.680 --> 2:46:19.280]  and I'm not bragging. I'm letting you know that together as a family, we have changed the world
[2:46:19.280 --> 2:46:25.200]  and that we have a responsibility because God put us in this position to not back down now at the
[2:46:25.200 --> 2:46:30.000]  very critical point. This is an info war and the globalists are trying to break your will and
[2:46:30.000 --> 2:46:36.160]  demoralize you and I produced a two-part course, Mind Wars Spirit Wars, six plus hours that lays out

[2:46:54.560 --> 2:47:24.400]  wars on the air. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:24.400 --> 2:47:30.720]  We are living in an incredible time. That Dr. Zelinko interview last hour was over the top
[2:47:30.720 --> 2:47:36.160]  powerful. I hope everybody shares it. That's how we save lives and expose this. Allison Steinberg
[2:47:36.160 --> 2:47:41.600]  is a makeup artist. He's been an activist for years, promoting Trump, promoting freedom,
[2:47:41.600 --> 2:47:46.640]  been persecuted massively for it, put out a super viral video that even when I saw it, I was like,
[2:47:46.640 --> 2:47:51.840]  I recognize her but who is that? They cut her name off and attacked her and then now she's got
[2:47:51.840 --> 2:47:57.520]  Republicans attacking her as well. You can find her at Allison Wonderland forever. Allison, in the
[2:47:57.520 --> 2:48:04.960]  10 minutes we've got left, I just want to hear from you as a woman, as an American and where you
[2:48:04.960 --> 2:48:13.040]  think all this is going? Well, I think this is going to a very scary place. If we don't act
[2:48:13.040 --> 2:48:18.560]  quickly, we've obviously been trying to do whatever we can over the last several years to
[2:48:18.560 --> 2:48:25.040]  counteract this. But unless everyone gets on board and unless everyone stands up hard core
[2:48:25.040 --> 2:48:30.240]  and fights like their life depends on it, I hear what the future holds. I don't put my face in
[2:48:31.120 --> 2:48:38.800]  the government but in God and unless we all get right with God as you always say, then I'm scared
[2:48:38.800 --> 2:48:45.120]  to see what comes of this. But I think we do still have hope. I think that if everyone put their money
[2:48:45.120 --> 2:48:51.520]  where their mouth is and I think if everyone actively resisted and especially vote with your
[2:48:51.520 --> 2:48:56.320]  dollar, I mean, we know votes don't really matter but that's the one vote that does. So if everyone
[2:48:56.320 --> 2:49:01.200]  stops spending money on stupid things that are owned by communist businesses here and there,
[2:49:01.200 --> 2:49:08.400]  then that would make a massive impact. And one more reason to support the Info War and support
[2:49:08.400 --> 2:49:13.520]  your products because we can't be giving our money to these people that are in support of this
[2:49:13.520 --> 2:49:20.240]  evil agenda. It's really on us. I said that in the video. It's on us 100% and you're going to have
[2:49:20.240 --> 2:49:25.600]  to make some sacrifices. No one ever said it was going to be easy but we've had it easy for so long.
[2:49:25.600 --> 2:49:31.920]  We've had such a life of luxury for so many years and now we're getting to the hard part and people
[2:49:31.920 --> 2:49:39.120]  have to be willing to do things that are not easy to keep our freedoms. If we want any chance of
[2:49:39.120 --> 2:49:43.760]  having this nice easy life that has been created for us, then we need to continue to fight for it.
[2:49:44.640 --> 2:49:48.880]  I totally agree with you. Where do you see Trump going from here? We made a big deal about Trump.
[2:49:49.600 --> 2:49:54.320]  He allowed himself to be censored. He allowed us to be censored and now he's been kind of isolated
[2:49:54.320 --> 2:49:59.920]  and I mean, did he make a deal to come out for the poison vaccines? We left alone or does he just
[2:49:59.920 --> 2:50:07.280]  think that's his legacy so he's doubling down? I still don't quite know what to take away from
[2:50:07.280 --> 2:50:13.280]  Trump. It's obviously extremely upsetting to see him speaking out about it the way he is but I don't
[2:50:13.280 --> 2:50:17.520]  know if he's ultimately in on it. I don't know if he's, you know, if it's all just this political
[2:50:17.520 --> 2:50:23.120]  theater used to create suicides and divide us up because we all know the evil divide and conquer
[2:50:23.120 --> 2:50:30.160]  tactics. I don't know if he's, you know, secretly behind this or if he did have our best interests
[2:50:30.160 --> 2:50:35.440]  and is just trying to appease everyone at this point but he should know better. He should know
[2:50:35.440 --> 2:50:41.920]  that you can't be weak in this. You can't continuously just try to please both sides. You
[2:50:41.920 --> 2:50:47.920]  either, you can't live with the system or seek your way around it. You either have to defy it
[2:50:47.920 --> 2:50:54.080]  or you're gonna end up endorsing it and it seems like he's endorsing it so I don't, I don't know
[2:50:54.080 --> 2:50:59.280]  how much longer we can hold out waiting for him. I don't know what this means for him ultimately
[2:50:59.280 --> 2:51:05.760]  but it's really concerning and I think people should start being more open-minded to that.
[2:51:06.720 --> 2:51:11.200]  Well, I mean, absolutely. Trump rode in on the populist, anti-globalist wave
[2:51:11.760 --> 2:51:16.400]  and if he wants to get off the wave and be with Fauci and be with Biden, that's fine
[2:51:16.400 --> 2:51:22.000]  but it's about our choice now. We're not going to be with that and Bill O'Reilly, I mean,
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:31.920]  this is really pathetic. It's very pathetic. I just, I don't know, it's stressful because
[2:51:32.800 --> 2:51:38.800]  obviously so many people were waiting for him and holding out for him and find ways to justify every
[2:51:38.800 --> 2:51:42.880]  little thing that he does but I don't know, I don't know where this goes from here. It seems
[2:51:42.880 --> 2:51:48.720]  like he's in connections with all of the wrong people. He continues to defend Fauci who's the
[2:51:48.720 --> 2:51:52.560]  root of all of this evil. I mean, if he really had our best interest, why wouldn't he have
[2:51:52.560 --> 2:51:57.760]  fired him long ago? Why does he continue to back these people and make excuses for
[2:51:57.760 --> 2:52:03.280]  people that are clearly not on our side? Well, I mean, Bill O'Reilly is an establishment conman
[2:52:03.280 --> 2:52:10.160]  and again, moving on from Trump, if he wants to make himself non-essential by pushing this
[2:52:10.160 --> 2:52:15.760]  tyranny because, you know, when he says the vaccine's good, he's lying because it doesn't
[2:52:15.760 --> 2:52:22.400]  protect you. In fact, we have the can of someone's clip. I want to play this. Trump says most Americans
[2:52:22.400 --> 2:52:28.080]  dying are unvaccinated and encourages everyone to get the shot. Here it is.
[2:52:28.800 --> 2:52:32.720]  In terms of big pharma, which is a huge topic on the minds of mothers especially,
[2:52:32.720 --> 2:52:36.000]  you're seeing what's happening at these school board meetings. Where do you stand on these
[2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:39.440]  vaccine mandates? And obviously, I know that you are, you are pro-vaccine obviously,
[2:52:39.440 --> 2:52:41.520]  did everything you could to get this vaccine out. I know where you stand in the vaccine.
[2:52:41.520 --> 2:52:44.560]  It was one of the greatest achievements we did in less than nine months.
[2:52:44.560 --> 2:52:49.840]  To be able to do that. But now it's taken a twist, right? It's gotten, now we went from
[2:52:49.840 --> 2:52:55.040]  this is a good thing and people should have this option to military men, you're going to have to
[2:52:55.040 --> 2:52:59.280]  resign because you're not getting this vaccine. Where do you stand on that? Well, I stand on,
[2:52:59.280 --> 2:53:02.400]  forget about the mandates that people have to have their freedom. But at the same time,
[2:53:03.120 --> 2:53:10.080]  the vaccine is one of the greatest achievements of mankind. We would have had a 1917, remember
[2:53:10.080 --> 2:53:15.200]  the Spanish flu killed perhaps a hundred million people. Actually, it ended the First World War
[2:53:15.200 --> 2:53:19.520]  because the soldiers was a lot of people don't know that the soldiers got so sick. It was a
[2:53:19.520 --> 2:53:24.160]  terrible thing. There were no vaccines who would know anything. I came up with a vaccine with three
[2:53:24.160 --> 2:53:29.840]  vaccines. All are very, very good. Came up with three of them in less than nine months. It was
[2:53:29.840 --> 2:53:35.600]  supposed to take five to 12 years. And we have died under COVID this year, by the way, under
[2:53:35.600 --> 2:53:40.480]  Joe Biden, then under you and more people took the vaccine this year. So people are questioning
[2:53:40.480 --> 2:53:45.920]  how the vaccine work. But some people aren't taking the ones, the ones that get very sick and go to
[2:53:45.920 --> 2:53:51.120]  the hospital or the ones that don't take their vaccine. But it's still their choice. And if you
[2:53:51.120 --> 2:53:56.080]  take the vaccine, you're protected. Look, the results of the vaccine are very good. And if you
[2:53:56.080 --> 2:54:01.200]  do get it, it's a very minor form. People aren't dying when they take the vaccine. The masking
[2:54:01.200 --> 2:54:05.120]  of children. That's a big one for moms right now. I think it's a terrible thing. I think it's a terrible
[2:54:05.120 --> 2:54:08.880]  thing. That flies in the face of science. The kids have a virtual zero percent chance of dying
[2:54:08.880 --> 2:54:12.960]  of COVID. And yet they're insisting on these vaccine mandates. I mean, I'm sorry, on these
[2:54:13.520 --> 2:54:18.640]  masking mandates and now even the vaccine mandates for small children. And what's going on there?
[2:54:18.640 --> 2:54:24.080]  I think what's happening is you look at the masks where Fauci and a lot of other people said masks
[2:54:24.080 --> 2:54:28.560]  don't mean anything. All of a sudden it becomes a radical massacre. I don't like to see the kids
[2:54:28.560 --> 2:54:31.840]  with the masks on. They're sitting in school. They have a hard enough time sitting in school.
[2:54:31.840 --> 2:54:36.640]  It's like China. I've been to China. Well, and yet China's education system is a hell of a lot
[2:54:36.640 --> 2:54:41.280]  better than ours. You know what? They're rated number two or three and we're rated number 44.
[2:54:42.160 --> 2:54:46.720]  But masking children, I mean, the way it looks, right? It doesn't look like a free country.
[2:54:46.720 --> 2:54:52.800]  I'm against. It's beyond a free country. It's a cult. So, you know, the mask is much better than a
[2:54:52.800 --> 2:55:00.720]  GMO shot that turns off their white blood cells. Alison Steinberg. Yeah. Well, I don't know. This
[2:55:00.720 --> 2:55:04.560]  mask is destroying the lives of so many. And I feel so terribly for these poor kids who are
[2:55:04.560 --> 2:55:09.040]  muggled up and can't even have a social life or any normal human interaction. I mean, think about
[2:55:09.040 --> 2:55:13.920]  the effects it's going to have on the kids long term. They have no hope at having any normal life.
[2:55:13.920 --> 2:55:21.120]  I know so many parents of children who the kids are just totally enabled to interact with kids
[2:55:21.120 --> 2:55:27.520]  like they used to. It's so devastating. It's ruining our future. And the fact that he's not
[2:55:27.520 --> 2:55:36.160]  even willing to speak on that is beyond infuriating. So, do we have to discard Trump? And what does
[2:55:36.160 --> 2:55:41.440]  that look like going into the next election? I mean, who would we vote for DeSantis? Who else?
[2:55:43.360 --> 2:55:47.440]  I don't know. Alex, at this point, I'm just so skeptical of everyone. I think all of these
[2:55:47.440 --> 2:55:53.760]  establishment people are hiding something. And I think they're all in on the vaccine.
[2:55:53.760 --> 2:55:57.840]  I think they all have money in Big Pharma. And I just don't know who to trust anymore.
[2:55:57.840 --> 2:56:02.720]  That's why I think you should be president. Yeah. Well, I'm definitely trustworthy,
[2:56:02.720 --> 2:56:07.360]  except I'm so crazy. But listen, I would love to get you doing reporting for us out on the West
[2:56:07.360 --> 2:56:12.560]  Coast. And I really appreciate you spending this time with us right before Christmas. And hopefully,
[2:56:12.560 --> 2:56:16.480]  you'll come back again soon. I love watching you on O and as soon as we get your Skype fixed,
[2:56:16.480 --> 2:56:20.400]  I would love to get you on as a regular guest here. In the minute and a half we have left here,
[2:56:21.360 --> 2:56:23.200]  what is your predictions for 2022?
[2:56:26.240 --> 2:56:34.160]  I think that we will hopefully see it split. But I don't know. I'm just not confident. I just know
[2:56:34.160 --> 2:56:40.800]  how everything is rigged. And I know that we don't really have much faith in the system anymore.
[2:56:40.800 --> 2:56:47.440]  So I think we need to focus on the leaders that really have our best interest at heart and have
[2:56:47.440 --> 2:56:53.040]  actively shown that and aren't just showing up conveniently when the time is here now. We need
[2:56:53.040 --> 2:57:01.760]  people that we actually know the history on and trust and just hope that there's some sort of
[2:57:01.760 --> 2:57:08.240]  blessing that happens. Because I don't know. I'm very skeptical of the system now. It's just hard
[2:57:08.240 --> 2:57:15.680]  to be hopeful that it will work out for us. But Allison Steinberg, from your mouth to God's ears,
[2:57:15.680 --> 2:57:21.040]  I cannot disagree with one thing you've said today. Again, where's the best place for people to find
[2:57:21.040 --> 2:57:27.120]  what you're saying uncensored? Uncensored is hard because they keep shutting me down. But for now,
[2:57:27.120 --> 2:57:32.880]  Instagram, Alice in Wonderland forever. And that's the same handle on TikTok and Telegram as well.
[2:57:32.880 --> 2:57:38.400]  You can also find my on the street reporting at Weber's Way.com. All right, have a great Christmas
[2:57:38.400 --> 2:57:42.320]  and look forward to talking to you again soon. Thank you so much all. Merry Christmas.
[2:57:42.320 --> 2:57:44.160]  Merry Christmas to you. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[2:57:46.720 --> 2:57:54.800]  History is happening now. As we close out the year 2021 and accelerate into the critical year
[2:57:54.800 --> 2:58:01.280]  of 2022, it is so important to really meditate on the fact and let it sink in that we are in the
[2:58:01.280 --> 2:58:08.320]  middle of a globalist world government takeover whose endgame is forced to be population. The
[2:58:08.320 --> 2:58:15.440]  death, the disease, the horror being caused by these GMO gene therapy shots is just the beginning.
[2:58:16.480 --> 2:58:22.720]  They are now accelerating a program that will collapse civilization. There's not much time left
[2:58:22.720 --> 2:58:27.200]  to turn this around. The globalists are now getting a big cyber attack ready that they're
[2:58:27.200 --> 2:58:32.240]  going to launch and again blame on terrorist and uses a pretext to further collapse civilization.
[2:58:32.880 --> 2:58:36.720]  Only being aware of this and only rally against it now can back them off.
[2:58:37.280 --> 2:58:42.080]  Please, ladies and gentlemen, continue to spread the word about info wars.com and news wars.com
[2:58:42.080 --> 2:58:46.640]  and the live show because you are the modern Paul Revere's without you we're going to lose.
[2:58:46.640 --> 2:58:53.520]  Christmas Day 2021 is almost here and I want to encourage our amazing listeners and viewers
[2:58:53.520 --> 2:58:58.960]  who have changed the world through your support of info wars to help take this fight against
[2:58:58.960 --> 2:59:04.640]  tyranny to the next level and that's what reset wars does. We've extended the sale of 25% off
[2:59:04.640 --> 2:59:10.480]  on the course, Mind Wars Spirit Wars. There's two courses in one until Christmas Day.
[2:59:11.120 --> 2:59:16.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, help give your friends, your family, your neighbors the gift of being
[2:59:16.240 --> 2:59:21.840]  aware of how the globalists are manipulating them and trying to break their will and please give
[2:59:21.840 --> 2:59:26.800]  yourself and the whole world the gift of keeping info wars on the air at this critical time.
[2:59:26.800 --> 2:59:30.480]  Without your support, we would have already been shut down with your support. We're not just going
[2:59:30.480 --> 2:59:35.600]  to stay on air. We're going to take the fight to the next level because now is the historic point.
[2:59:36.320 --> 2:59:42.000]  Now is the inflection point and it's all about reset wars 25% off through Christmas Day at reset
[2:59:42.000 --> 2:59:54.160]  wars.com. Get the course now. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[3:00:03.920 --> 3:00:09.680]  All right. We have a very special guest toast about to take over here in five minutes.
[3:00:09.680 --> 3:00:17.040]  Hey, dally. Hey, Dr. Zalinko on an amazing guest and our last guest was incredible as well.
[3:00:18.240 --> 3:00:21.280]  You definitely don't want to miss what's coming up though. But man, some of the news
[3:00:22.080 --> 3:00:28.320]  breaking on info wars.com. Pfizer buys pharmaceutical company that makes heart medication
[3:00:28.320 --> 3:00:36.480]  to solve the problem caused by mRNA vaccines. Wow. You cannot make this up little one
[3:00:36.480 --> 3:00:44.080]  and some of the other headlines info wars.com as well. But it is just mind blowing.
[3:00:44.080 --> 3:00:52.800]  Journalist covering Gisling trial has laptop stolen after Maxwell sister snaps their photo.
[3:00:56.800 --> 3:01:03.520]  Australia's chief pharmacist says public needs to accept boosters and mass mandates for many
[3:01:03.520 --> 3:01:09.920]  years to come. I covered a fraction of the pile in front of me, but we did a good job overall.
[3:01:10.800 --> 3:01:16.720]  But man, it is just so much crazier than I can even even say or even break down. Wow.
[3:01:18.080 --> 3:01:21.360]  So we're going to go to break here in about four minutes and Kate dally is about to take over.
[3:01:23.760 --> 3:01:28.160]  And I just want to as we near Christmas here, thank the crew for the great job they've done and
[3:01:28.160 --> 3:01:33.840]  thank all the viewers. Let's keep us on air. But I sit here and I read this news and I cover these
[3:01:33.840 --> 3:01:39.440]  facts and it's just hard for me to even believe even though I knew this was all coming. It's
[3:01:39.440 --> 3:01:46.880]  still so insane. It's really hard to come to grips with the fact that we really have a global
[3:01:46.880 --> 3:01:52.320]  government. They really are deploying the population because I mean 30 years ago I was reading
[3:01:52.320 --> 3:01:59.040]  these documents 28 years ago I got on air and I thought, you know, they're talking about this,
[3:01:59.040 --> 3:02:03.280]  but they're not really going to do this. I mean, come on, they're not going to. Sure,
[3:02:03.280 --> 3:02:07.920]  they've done it as a micro test in some third world countries, but they don't have the will
[3:02:09.360 --> 3:02:14.400]  to actually try this in the real world against the general population and folks they've done
[3:02:14.400 --> 3:02:22.960]  it. And it's been our unconsciousness and our acquiescence and our weakness, mine included,
[3:02:24.240 --> 3:02:30.400]  that has encouraged this type of attack on society and on humanity.
[3:02:32.400 --> 3:02:36.960]  So I've already gone after Trump becoming pro injection and pushing and I'm going to move on
[3:02:36.960 --> 3:02:41.280]  for him. He really is hurting himself. I'm not going to try to get the middle of that,
[3:02:41.280 --> 3:02:46.000]  but we know who the current president is and that's Joe Biden. We know Democrats all over the US
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:02:51.040]  are setting up vaccine checkpoints and trying to intimidate people into taking these GMO shots
[3:02:51.040 --> 3:02:56.240]  that are directly linked and mainline news to infertility. I mean, look, here's the Wall
[3:02:56.240 --> 3:03:01.360]  Street Journal yesterday, the dangerous push to get boosters to teens.
[3:03:03.840 --> 3:03:07.120]  Why would the corporate media do that? They're covering their ass. The risk of vaccination
[3:03:07.120 --> 3:03:13.840]  cover transmission is not low. Scientific American says no, actually, the vaccinator
[3:03:13.840 --> 3:03:21.120]  is spreading it worse than anybody. And it goes on and on and on. Then they're scared of Jesse
[3:03:21.120 --> 3:03:29.680]  Waters coming out and saying, we need to confront Fauci with the truth that he ran the Wuwan Lab
[3:03:29.680 --> 3:03:34.080]  and they were involved in this. That's the kill shot. And they go, oh, you mean murder him as a
[3:03:34.080 --> 3:03:40.720]  distraction? No, no, he's the one giving us the kill shot. He's the one coming after everybody.
[3:03:41.440 --> 3:03:46.960]  He's the one bringing us the GMO injection that killed lab animals and the secret tests that
[3:03:46.960 --> 3:03:55.520]  have now come out. All right, the next 54 minutes, we're going to have Kate Daly take over,
[3:03:55.520 --> 3:04:04.400]  syndicated talk show host and Owen shroyer is going to be taking over here today as well in the start
[3:04:04.400 --> 3:04:12.320]  of his show in again, 56 minutes from now, Alice Steinberg was amazing as well. And I just again
[3:04:12.320 --> 3:04:19.200]  want to thank the crew for the amazing job they've done in the last year here. And we're now 320 days
[3:04:19.200 --> 3:04:23.760]  out. Didn't even get to this stack I meant to obviously the special report for tomorrow or
[3:04:23.760 --> 3:04:30.320]  Saturday with the whole martial law CIA says martial law is inevitable. You mean you politically
[3:04:30.320 --> 3:04:35.680]  lost control. You mean the public has woken up to you. You mean the world knows what you're doing.
[3:04:35.680 --> 3:04:40.000]  And so now you want to start a fake civil war that you blame on the American people with
[3:04:40.000 --> 3:04:46.160]  provocateurs. We know what you're up to. And it's all coming out. All right, stay with us. We'll be
[3:04:46.160 --> 3:04:54.800]  right back at T minus 60 seconds on this live Thursday, December 23rd broadcast.

[3:05:54.400 --> 3:06:08.560]  special. Hi back here with you. I'm Kate Daly, your guest host for this hour. Thank you, Alex.
[3:06:08.560 --> 3:06:14.080]  I hope you have a really, really Merry Christmas. And of course, I hope all of you do too. In fact,
[3:06:14.080 --> 3:06:19.600]  you know, it's interesting when you're doing live radio every day, you come up on a crossroads when
[3:06:19.600 --> 3:06:25.120]  it comes to holidays a little bit. I have to be honest, it's a little tough because I have
[3:06:25.120 --> 3:06:31.840]  breaking news. I have tough news. I have news that hurts because I don't even want to hear it. I know
[3:06:31.840 --> 3:06:37.360]  you don't want to hear it. It's hard right to know the truth and to be awake. It's also our biggest
[3:06:37.360 --> 3:06:45.920]  blessing. But what's interesting about radio is that and I think they have known this in history
[3:06:45.920 --> 3:06:51.520]  all along is that you have to fill the coffers once in a while as well. And they had to do that
[3:06:51.520 --> 3:06:57.440]  during the Revolutionary War. They had to do it during well, you can go back to any century in history.
[3:06:58.400 --> 3:07:05.680]  So I was at a crossroads a little bit this week with what message do you share? What message do
[3:07:05.680 --> 3:07:12.400]  you give? And I think right now with the tough news cycle that is going on right now and it is
[3:07:12.400 --> 3:07:17.840]  tough. I mean, I was just listening to Alex and it is as I agree with him. It's really, really hard
[3:07:17.840 --> 3:07:24.160]  right now because the news is shocking. You know, it used to be the battle between the Dems and the
[3:07:24.160 --> 3:07:31.280]  Repubs and not anymore, not anymore. It's what shocking thing are they going to try to lie to
[3:07:31.280 --> 3:07:38.800]  us about, claim? What are they going to do next? And so I hope today's message inspires you.
[3:07:39.440 --> 3:07:43.600]  Inspires you to fight a little harder, do a little more, speak a little more truth. Every
[3:07:43.600 --> 3:07:49.600]  time I see the meme, peace on earth. I see it fly on my Facebook page. You know, I'm in Facebook
[3:07:49.600 --> 3:07:54.000]  jail of course right now, but I see it fly on my Facebook page all the time and you know,
[3:07:54.000 --> 3:07:58.640]  peace on earth. I just want peace on earth. You know what I want? I want truth on earth.
[3:07:58.640 --> 3:08:04.800]  That's what I want. Just truth. Truth brings peace. I think we're asking for the wrong thing.
[3:08:06.000 --> 3:08:09.360]  And I think right now as we all celebrate Christmas in just a few days,
[3:08:10.160 --> 3:08:14.080]  I think one of the questions that people will be asking in the kind of the back of their mind,
[3:08:15.040 --> 3:08:21.120]  does God really care about us? Does he really care about freedom? It's a tough news cycle.
[3:08:21.920 --> 3:08:24.560]  It's hard to believe sometimes he's still there, right?
[3:08:24.560 --> 3:08:33.280]  And it seems as though the deep state has every single advantage all the time. They have the media,
[3:08:33.280 --> 3:08:38.160]  they have Hollyweird, they have all those sickos. They have everybody. They have everybody.
[3:08:39.040 --> 3:08:46.080]  It's hard to know exactly where the good is happening, but it is. It is. And I want to
[3:08:46.080 --> 3:08:50.880]  share some of that with you today, hopefully. As we celebrate these holidays, some of you might
[3:08:50.880 --> 3:08:56.160]  have a little heaviness of heart. Let's fix that. I might have some messages that might make you
[3:08:56.160 --> 3:09:01.280]  change your perspective today. My friend Glenn Rossin reminded me of this wonderful story that
[3:09:01.280 --> 3:09:06.320]  has everything to do with where we find ourselves right now. And if I could go back to any place
[3:09:06.320 --> 3:09:12.960]  in history, and I mean any century, really any century, any place, any people, I don't care if
[3:09:12.960 --> 3:09:16.960]  they're brown or green or I don't care what they look like. I don't care who they are. I don't care
[3:09:16.960 --> 3:09:24.480]  what religion they are. We've always had the oppressed by government. Always. The citizens of
[3:09:24.480 --> 3:09:30.640]  Rome, they had Spartacus. Moses had God. Do you remember when Mary and Joseph were going to go
[3:09:30.640 --> 3:09:39.040]  pay their taxes? And they had to travel so far. And honestly, as pregnant as she could be, they
[3:09:39.040 --> 3:09:43.920]  still had to go try to pay their taxes for fear that the government was going to come down on them.
[3:09:43.920 --> 3:09:50.320]  And they were doing it at a time in Bethlehem when people gathered to do this. And what's interesting
[3:09:50.320 --> 3:09:56.960]  about that is that as they gathered to do this, there were a lot of thieves and robbers around
[3:09:56.960 --> 3:10:01.760]  and a lot of people around. They could have done a lot of harm to them. But they knew they had to
[3:10:01.760 --> 3:10:07.600]  because the government was so oppressive at the time that they had to take the journey. They had
[3:10:07.600 --> 3:10:13.440]  to. And they had to risk her going into labor. They had to risk the baby. They had to risk everything
[3:10:13.440 --> 3:10:22.560]  to go pay their little cents at the taxation store, if you will. Mary and Joseph were not
[3:10:22.560 --> 3:10:28.880]  good global citizens. I'll tell you that. The Christ child would have never made it had Mary
[3:10:28.880 --> 3:10:33.680]  and Joseph been a good global citizen, a good citizen that was told to obey its government at
[3:10:33.680 --> 3:10:40.160]  every step. It just wouldn't have happened. They would have offered him up. What did the government
[3:10:40.160 --> 3:10:47.840]  decree? That under the age of two, you would be dead, right? You would die. There were some good
[3:10:47.840 --> 3:10:52.960]  global citizens, but Mary and Joseph were not among them. What does that tell us about today?
[3:10:52.960 --> 3:10:58.320]  It tells me a lot. It tells me to fight a very oppressive government and consistently resist
[3:10:58.320 --> 3:11:04.880]  as they've done in the past. Mary and Joseph did for Pete's sakes. We had in our time George
[3:11:04.880 --> 3:11:13.200]  Washington and Thomas Paine. And why do I mention Thomas Paine? Well, as the troops were positioned
[3:11:14.320 --> 3:11:20.320]  on the Delaware across from General House mercenaries, the army was reduced from 20,000
[3:11:20.320 --> 3:11:25.040]  soldiers, George Washington's army, to about 6,000 soldiers, not a very big presence. They were up
[3:11:25.040 --> 3:11:31.120]  against the largest army in the world. Think about that. What would that look like now? Would we
[3:11:31.120 --> 3:11:36.960]  feel pretty defeated? Of course. There was no winter clothing. They were starving. They were reduced
[3:11:36.960 --> 3:11:44.640]  to eating tree bark, bitter cold, as you can imagine, as it is right now. Six thousand men
[3:11:44.640 --> 3:11:49.200]  probably wondered what they were even fighting for because liberty had never really been achieved
[3:11:49.200 --> 3:11:53.680]  in the way that we were about to do it. It was just an idea. It wasn't even substantiated.
[3:11:53.680 --> 3:11:58.480]  They didn't really have a big taste of what that would look like or feel like at the time.
[3:11:58.480 --> 3:12:04.640]  There were not enough guns, not enough ammunition, not enough food. But there was this incredible
[3:12:04.640 --> 3:12:09.920]  idea that we could change history by owning our own government, a very limited government,
[3:12:09.920 --> 3:12:15.840]  and that we could actually have our liberty back. We could actually attain full liberty status.
[3:12:15.840 --> 3:12:21.840]  Very exciting. But to the soldiers sitting there starving, and I mean emaciated,
[3:12:21.840 --> 3:12:29.520]  with clothes that were barely tatters, barefoot, many of them, it was probably really hard
[3:12:30.080 --> 3:12:36.560]  to keep sight of an idea. I'm going to imagine that. Very, very hard. We weren't even fully
[3:12:36.560 --> 3:12:42.560]  America at this point. But Thomas Paine walked in, started talking to the troops, and he penned
[3:12:42.560 --> 3:12:48.560]  what some said, the American crisis. And this was in the month of December, 1776. The American
[3:12:48.560 --> 3:12:59.360]  crisis. Think about what we're in right now. His words were very compelling. This is what he said,
[3:12:59.360 --> 3:13:06.240]  and he was said to write it on the head of a drum at the time. Remember, everything was scarce.
[3:13:06.880 --> 3:13:13.440]  He said, these are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot
[3:13:13.440 --> 3:13:20.640]  will in this crisis shrink from the service of their country. But he stands it now. But he
[3:13:20.640 --> 3:13:26.720]  that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of every man and woman. Tyranny, like hell,
[3:13:27.520 --> 3:13:32.880]  is not easily conquered. Yet we have this consolation within us that the harder the conflict,
[3:13:32.880 --> 3:13:40.960]  the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly. It is due
[3:13:40.960 --> 3:13:48.960]  to light. It is dearness only that gives everything its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price
[3:13:48.960 --> 3:13:55.600]  upon its goods. And it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be
[3:13:55.600 --> 3:14:01.200]  highly rated. Britain with an army to enforce her tyranny has declared that she has a right
[3:14:01.200 --> 3:14:06.480]  not only to tax but to bind us in all cases whatsoever. Isn't that what we're looking at now?
[3:14:06.480 --> 3:14:13.680]  And if being bound by that manner is not slavery, then there is not such a thing as slavery upon
[3:14:13.680 --> 3:14:21.680]  earth. Even the expression for so unlimited a power can only belong to God. He wrote those words
[3:14:21.680 --> 3:14:28.960]  and it uplifted George Washington and the troops so much so because remember, their stay in the
[3:14:28.960 --> 3:14:34.960]  army was about to expire December 31st. The British weren't going after them because they knew that
[3:14:34.960 --> 3:14:41.040]  they were going to expire and take off anyway. They were starving. They had nothing. They were
[3:14:41.040 --> 3:14:47.680]  suffering. They knew they wouldn't last. So at that time, they sort of waited them out on the
[3:14:47.680 --> 3:14:54.240]  other side of the river. Well, Christmas Day, George Washington forged ahead. And we all know
[3:14:54.240 --> 3:14:59.440]  the outcome of that battle because it was pivotal to what became of America. But my interest in
[3:14:59.440 --> 3:15:06.880]  that was how do you get a group of people so defeated, so utterly defeated that they would
[3:15:06.880 --> 3:15:12.720]  again stand up to fight for only an idea? I mean, we've had a taste of it. We know what liberty is.
[3:15:14.000 --> 3:15:20.000]  But to them, it was just this idea. But there again, those words gave them the hope to keep
[3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:26.800]  fighting and more joined. And that was the secret. It was in numbers. It was in numbers.
[3:15:26.800 --> 3:15:31.200]  They won that battle was a turning point of the revolution, one of the several turning points
[3:15:31.200 --> 3:15:36.560]  that gave us our freedom today. I'll be right back because I want to describe you in this fight.
[3:15:37.440 --> 3:15:42.800]  I want to describe me in this fight. I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from the Kate Dally Show.
[3:15:42.800 --> 3:15:56.800]  You can go to Kate Dally radio.com. I'll be right back. If you think the tyranny and oppression
[3:15:56.800 --> 3:16:02.640]  we're living under now is bad, wait till they've got their world ID and that's exactly what the
[3:16:02.640 --> 3:16:09.040]  covid passports are all about. And clout swab and the UN and all the other globalist leaders own
[3:16:09.040 --> 3:16:14.640]  words, they admit that once they've gotten you with that system, then they're going to carbon
[3:16:14.640 --> 3:16:20.160]  tax you everywhere you go and track what you do. And publicly, they're saying they're going to side
[3:16:20.160 --> 3:16:25.760]  when you can travel and when you can't travel and mastercard and then all the other big companies
[3:16:25.760 --> 3:16:30.480]  are currently announcing that are going to track what you do and where you go and tax you with
[3:16:30.480 --> 3:16:36.560]  a carbon tax for it. This is the holy grail of tyranny, ladies and gentlemen. This is the take
[3:16:36.560 --> 3:16:41.600]  over in humanity. Better wake up and say no. Finally, folks are starting to wake up. Joe
[3:16:41.600 --> 3:16:45.520]  Rogan, Tucker Carlson, others are leaving the charts along with info wars, but it's not enough.
[3:16:45.520 --> 3:16:50.560]  Every individual has to not comply. We have to talk about bringing the globalist to justice.

[3:17:11.920 --> 3:17:17.440]  perspective in my definitions and my way of seeing the world. It doesn't mean it's perfectly right.

[3:17:54.240 --> 3:18:00.960]  Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome. Hello, Alex.
[3:18:00.960 --> 3:18:05.200]  Yes, Malcolm. All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get
[3:18:05.200 --> 3:18:10.400]  on the line. Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer,
[3:18:10.400 --> 3:18:16.240]  SuperMail Vitality and Brain Force Plus. Mix those two together. You're an unstoppable tank.
[3:18:16.240 --> 3:18:21.680]  SuperMail Vitality really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have
[3:18:21.680 --> 3:18:27.920]  never been heated up. And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions. It also
[3:18:27.920 --> 3:18:33.280]  worked quite well, but just aren't as strong. This is like a very fine wine. In fact, each batch
[3:18:33.280 --> 3:18:36.560]  is different. Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay. People are like,
[3:18:36.560 --> 3:18:39.760]  why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong? That's just
[3:18:39.760 --> 3:18:45.920]  how it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong. But
[3:18:45.920 --> 3:18:53.600]  yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[3:18:58.480 --> 3:19:04.160]  Get our great bag of it here. I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico,
[3:19:04.160 --> 3:19:08.960]  the communists? Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested
[3:19:08.960 --> 3:19:13.760]  above organic in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee. And yeah, we buy it from the
[3:19:13.760 --> 3:19:17.840]  little farmers that the media calls communists, but really, they're just a commune. And whatever
[3:19:17.840 --> 3:19:21.680]  the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it. And the farmers don't let the Mexican
[3:19:21.680 --> 3:19:24.960]  government take over. So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels. And I've been buying it for,
[3:19:24.960 --> 3:19:28.800]  what, 14 years and the price has never gone up. The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another
[3:19:28.800 --> 3:19:33.040]  name for about 50% more per pound. And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to
[3:19:33.040 --> 3:19:38.640]  find anywhere. It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally. In fact,
[3:19:38.640 --> 3:19:45.280]  I'm not going to tell you a little story. We had like that. I think you wouldn't believe it.
[3:19:45.280 --> 3:19:50.400]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com. And that's how we fund this operation. And if you don't
[3:19:50.400 --> 3:20:14.320]  find us, you don't want to share, that's fine. Okay, Dali here for Alex Jones and so happy to
[3:20:14.320 --> 3:20:19.120]  be here, especially two days before Christmas. What a wonderful time to be on the show.
[3:20:19.120 --> 3:20:24.880]  I'm actually really happy about that because you have to fill the coffers of hope as much as you,
[3:20:25.600 --> 3:20:30.080]  as much as you talk about the things that are pretty terrifying that are happening right now.
[3:20:30.720 --> 3:20:37.120]  And I think what's amazing, I think especially because Alex has done so much work in enlightening
[3:20:37.120 --> 3:20:44.160]  people, I do want to talk about one of our greatest blessings. And that is that we're awake. We see
[3:20:44.160 --> 3:20:49.840]  it. Man, can you imagine being somebody that doesn't see it? Can you imagine being that guy?
[3:20:51.440 --> 3:20:58.160]  Anyway, so I was talking about George Washington. And I was really thinking a lot about
[3:20:58.160 --> 3:21:02.880]  that time period. You know, it's always nice to hear a story from the past. And you try to put
[3:21:02.880 --> 3:21:08.720]  yourself in their shoes. And it's sometimes it can be difficult because we think of them as a
[3:21:08.720 --> 3:21:12.640]  different people at such a different time and that, oh, they're not us and they're not going
[3:21:12.640 --> 3:21:18.560]  through what we're going through. But you know, they really were just in a different way. Same
[3:21:18.560 --> 3:21:25.040]  battle. Had it not been for that moment, America would have succumbed. Had it not been for those
[3:21:25.040 --> 3:21:31.600]  words that I think were pretty divinely appointed at the time to Thomas Paine, who really uplifted
[3:21:31.600 --> 3:21:36.480]  the troops at the time and reminded them about how precious liberty is about what they were fighting
[3:21:36.480 --> 3:21:43.200]  for was so amazing that they had to keep going even though they were completely suffering at the time.
[3:21:45.280 --> 3:21:54.400]  And his divine words of encouragement and focus really sort of impressed upon the troops that
[3:21:54.400 --> 3:21:59.040]  they had to keep going that it was really going to be worth it. It was really going to be worth it.
[3:22:00.320 --> 3:22:05.120]  And even at our lowest points in history, no matter what century you pick, no matter what
[3:22:05.120 --> 3:22:12.240]  people were talking about, there's always been God provided miracles, hasn't there, at every single turn.
[3:22:14.320 --> 3:22:22.000]  Look at Rome. They had Spartacus. There was always somebody put in the path to help out,
[3:22:22.640 --> 3:22:27.920]  to inspire, to encourage the troops, to get them gathered, and to get them to do
[3:22:27.920 --> 3:22:35.760]  the impossible, really, right? Always provided the miracle of the right person at the right time to lift us up.
[3:22:36.800 --> 3:22:44.320]  In other words, think of it this way, they've never won. The deep state has never really won.
[3:22:45.200 --> 3:22:49.920]  Because had they got their way, my gosh, we would have been done for a long time ago.
[3:22:49.920 --> 3:22:57.840]  They've never been able to beat God. Isn't that interesting? In America, when they had their way
[3:22:57.840 --> 3:23:03.760]  with central banking and the UN, the introduction of the UN in just about a 30-year time span,
[3:23:03.760 --> 3:23:10.720]  pretty quick, right, and the CIA, they would have shut this country down quickly, wouldn't they?
[3:23:10.720 --> 3:23:18.720]  If they could have. Look how many years it's taken for them to do damage. And that's always
[3:23:18.720 --> 3:23:24.480]  the case. And that's only because we've been asleep. We've been trying to raise families.
[3:23:24.480 --> 3:23:28.320]  We've been trying to do those things that keep us very, very busy, I'm sure.
[3:23:30.240 --> 3:23:34.960]  But isn't it amazing that when you look back on that battle of George Washington, a very pivotal
[3:23:34.960 --> 3:23:39.360]  point in America succeeding, isn't it amazing that it was done on Christmas Day?
[3:23:39.360 --> 3:23:51.120]  Freedom from chains in both cases. Birth of Christ. And really the birth of this country,
[3:23:51.840 --> 3:23:56.000]  because it was really the mindset. The country could never be just a piece of property.
[3:23:56.720 --> 3:24:02.160]  Land is land. It's the people and their perspective, what they fight for,
[3:24:02.160 --> 3:24:07.520]  what they're about, their character level, their values, what they represent that makes a country,
[3:24:07.520 --> 3:24:12.080]  right? And this country is filled with people who could see what was going on.
[3:24:12.080 --> 3:24:18.640]  We were never so oppressed that we couldn't fight for our lives, that we couldn't fight for our
[3:24:18.640 --> 3:24:26.480]  country. We were never so oppressed, right? We weren't in the state of what some Romans were
[3:24:26.480 --> 3:24:32.080]  at the time, right? We were looking ahead. Americans have always had a gift that they could
[3:24:32.080 --> 3:24:37.520]  look ahead and see what was coming and see how government was going to handle things.
[3:24:38.320 --> 3:24:43.760]  And we knew that we didn't want it. We knew that if the British were kept in charge,
[3:24:44.880 --> 3:24:48.240]  that we would continue to get more and more oppression. We knew that.
[3:24:50.240 --> 3:24:54.640]  What a gift that is. And what a gift it was that we were able to fight
[3:24:54.640 --> 3:25:02.720]  just at the idea of what the government was going to do, that we, good men and women,
[3:25:03.360 --> 3:25:10.080]  mostly men, were able to suffer, were able to get through what they got through
[3:25:10.880 --> 3:25:17.200]  for this country. That's pretty amazing. When it comes to evidence of God, I think there's
[3:25:17.200 --> 3:25:23.280]  plenty of it. Go back in the centuries. No wonder the world celebrates Christmas. No wonder they
[3:25:23.280 --> 3:25:30.000]  celebrate the birth of Christ. It's been illegal during the centuries. It's been absolutely illegal
[3:25:30.000 --> 3:25:37.440]  to celebrate. But since we formed America, religious freedom, it was that important to be able to do
[3:25:38.000 --> 3:25:41.920]  and worship in the way that we wanted to have the freedom to do that.
[3:25:43.680 --> 3:25:49.040]  But isn't it interesting that only Christmas Day can bring kindness, can bring love,
[3:25:49.040 --> 3:25:54.640]  can bring the Christmas miracles, can bring all of the things that only Christmas can do?
[3:25:55.200 --> 3:25:57.920]  No other birth could do that. It's pretty amazing.
[3:26:00.160 --> 3:26:05.760]  You know, looking at forced inoculations right now, we look at the loss of body autonomy.
[3:26:06.640 --> 3:26:12.880]  And quite simply, right now, I think we've already lost body autonomy. When you go in
[3:26:12.880 --> 3:26:17.120]  the hospital, it's very difficult to get them to listen to you, medical tyranny at its best.
[3:26:17.120 --> 3:26:24.560]  I know, I lived it with my husband. And that was tough to see. We can still fight against it.
[3:26:24.560 --> 3:26:27.600]  We can still provide the resistance against it. And we're going to.
[3:26:28.880 --> 3:26:33.840]  But isn't it interesting how much we've lost that we need to regain? That means we need to
[3:26:33.840 --> 3:26:39.440]  wake up quickly. And that means we also need to wake others up too. Because in the event of that
[3:26:39.440 --> 3:26:44.160]  event that happened with George Washington, what's really interesting about that is that
[3:26:44.160 --> 3:26:54.160]  the government basically at that time could have taken us out and they didn't, right? They didn't.
[3:26:56.000 --> 3:27:00.720]  And that was a miracle. It was a miracle that we fought. It was a miracle that we resisted.
[3:27:00.720 --> 3:27:03.920]  It was a miracle that we got America. But the Constitution's still in place,
[3:27:04.480 --> 3:27:10.080]  the one that was formed through the blood of that event. If the Constitution's still there,
[3:27:10.080 --> 3:27:18.000]  that means we can utilize it. And last I checked, it was still there. And what's also interesting
[3:27:18.000 --> 3:27:25.760]  about this is your role in this. You know, for some reason, you're here right now. We can look
[3:27:25.760 --> 3:27:30.080]  back at the Founding Fathers. We can look back at David and Goliath. We can look back at Moses.
[3:27:30.080 --> 3:27:36.240]  We can look back at all the times in history when different people appeared to be able to
[3:27:36.240 --> 3:27:43.360]  perform a miracle of their time. But you know what? We are too, the miracle of this time.
[3:27:44.240 --> 3:27:49.360]  And we're used and utilized. And I think that's really important to know. And those of you that
[3:27:49.360 --> 3:27:53.680]  get down around Christmas time, for some time, you know, some people, it's a sad time. It's a hard
[3:27:53.680 --> 3:28:00.560]  time. They get depressed. I understand it. I've been there before. But you must have had enough
[3:28:00.560 --> 3:28:08.880]  confidence in you, and in me, and in all the people that understand what's going on,
[3:28:10.080 --> 3:28:14.400]  that he has enough confidence in us right now at this time to help out and do our part.
[3:28:15.440 --> 3:28:23.280]  That's a pretty phenomenal idea, isn't it? That he has confidence in us. We're supposed to be here
[3:28:23.280 --> 3:28:30.560]  right now. This is our time. And if you're alive and on this earth, you're here for a reason. And
[3:28:30.560 --> 3:28:35.520]  there's no reason to get down on the holidays. Because you're being counted on right now.
[3:28:36.400 --> 3:28:42.320]  To do the impossible, and to have faith in miracles, and to restore the country. It's you and me,
[3:28:42.320 --> 3:28:49.120]  kid. I'll be right back. Kate Dahle. I have so much more to say. Stay with me. Kate Dahle
[3:28:49.120 --> 3:28:59.440]  for Alex Jones. Thank you. Be right back. Well, here we are. The year 2021 is almost over.

[3:30:59.520 --> 3:31:05.360]  globalist. I wanted to stop their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their
[3:31:05.360 --> 3:31:10.960]  tracks before they went operational. But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes, we're not
[3:31:10.960 --> 3:31:17.280]  getting caught flat-footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization
[3:31:17.280 --> 3:31:22.160]  great reset. And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners
[3:31:22.160 --> 3:31:26.320]  tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear
[3:31:26.320 --> 3:31:30.400]  the truth. So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda,
[3:31:30.400 --> 3:31:34.160]  but we've also got to get personally prepared. And one of the number one things to do is high
[3:31:34.160 --> 3:31:38.480]  quality, storeable food. You've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices

[3:32:08.080 --> 3:32:12.480]  I can say without a shadow of a doubt intellectually, spiritually, and at a gut level,
[3:32:12.480 --> 3:32:17.840]  that all hell has already broken loose and it's about to get 10 times worse. But this is the time
[3:32:17.840 --> 3:32:22.560]  that tries men and women's souls. And this is the time when we're going to all see who we really are.

[3:32:57.760 --> 3:33:03.760]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:03.760 --> 3:33:18.640]  Kate Dally. Back here with you from the Kate Dally Show. KateDallyRadio.com. I hope you have a
[3:33:18.640 --> 3:33:24.160]  amazing Christmas. I really do. I hope you celebrate it with just about everything in your heart and
[3:33:24.160 --> 3:33:29.520]  all the passion that you can muster because you know what? They hate it out there. The cultural
[3:33:29.520 --> 3:33:36.080]  left, those lefties, those asinine jokes of people. They hate it. They hate Christmas.
[3:33:37.440 --> 3:33:42.160]  They hate that we believe in God. They hate it. They hate it and you know what? It's okay.
[3:33:42.960 --> 3:33:49.680]  It's okay. Have passion in it. Do it right. I was looking back. I just hit my 10-year anniversary
[3:33:49.680 --> 3:33:55.600]  mark for being in radio and I was looking back at all these things even in just this year that
[3:33:55.600 --> 3:34:00.880]  we've talked about and it's so amazing to me because even since the inception of the country,
[3:34:00.880 --> 3:34:07.360]  they knew that they could not go up against our liberty as people fully, okay? They nick at it.
[3:34:07.360 --> 3:34:13.440]  They try. They do everything they can do. They even tried to pass, you know, encouraging vaccines
[3:34:13.440 --> 3:34:18.640]  act, right? And I did a show right here on Alex Jones about the whole pharma and I know he's
[3:34:18.640 --> 3:34:23.840]  done many shows on pharma and so we know the game, right? But isn't it amazing that they
[3:34:23.840 --> 3:34:28.240]  never really could fully pass it even when they refer to Jacobson versus Massachusetts? I've mentioned
[3:34:28.240 --> 3:34:36.960]  this a few times when I've guest hosted and even that, they had to offer a $5 or the vaccine. They
[3:34:36.960 --> 3:34:44.560]  could never fully get rid of your liberty. Think about that. They were never able to fully do it
[3:34:44.560 --> 3:34:50.160]  even though now the media looks back and says, oh yeah, the Supreme Court, oh yeah, they were all in
[3:34:50.160 --> 3:34:55.520]  on on inoculations and people had to have them. No, they didn't. Jacobson versus Massachusetts,
[3:34:55.520 --> 3:35:00.960]  Jacobson never had to have the shot. He had to pay the five bucks. That's what the case was about,
[3:35:00.960 --> 3:35:07.200]  but you're not told that, okay? We know the media lies. They're a bunch of whores. They totally lie
[3:35:07.200 --> 3:35:16.080]  all the time. And so why would you believe them now, right? Well, they never could fully do it.
[3:35:16.080 --> 3:35:24.480]  King fraud a lot and little Hormala, who stole the election, couldn't pass off his ridiculous
[3:35:24.480 --> 3:35:30.640]  press conference as a law. And they had to back down, didn't they? They had to. His press conference
[3:35:30.640 --> 3:35:37.520]  was never a decree, a law, we don't have a king, a mandate, nothing. It was smoke and mirrors.
[3:35:38.160 --> 3:35:44.880]  Osha, who has no real authority to exist, right, could not get a court to hardly side with them
[3:35:44.880 --> 3:35:51.680]  ever in their history had to back down too. We're starting to see the smoke and mirrors.
[3:35:52.800 --> 3:35:56.480]  The American people are forming an underground. It's kind of amazing.
[3:35:57.520 --> 3:36:03.600]  Doctors now, the unvaxxed with the unvaxxed patients out there that need care, are now
[3:36:03.600 --> 3:36:08.400]  starting to look for funding so they can get away from the system and create their own underground
[3:36:08.400 --> 3:36:13.760]  system underground above ground. I love that. Pilots are doing the same thing. You want to catch a
[3:36:13.760 --> 3:36:19.200]  flight, you know, chipping a few bucks for gas, you know, that kind of thing, which is illegal.
[3:36:19.200 --> 3:36:24.080]  I would never do that in a million years. But you know what, you're starting to see the
[3:36:24.080 --> 3:36:28.240]  underground develop. You're starting to see people go, I don't have to be part of the system anymore.
[3:36:29.600 --> 3:36:34.800]  When we saw over 110 pilot deaths due to mostly the shot
[3:36:36.480 --> 3:36:40.880]  and six deaths the year before in their own pilot magazine, there's a problem, right?
[3:36:40.880 --> 3:36:46.800]  Right. We know it. They can't hide it anymore. That's the problem. Triple vaccinated are four
[3:36:46.800 --> 3:36:53.440]  more times as likely to get to test positive for the moronic variant than the unvaccinated.
[3:36:54.880 --> 3:37:00.240]  Okay. The unjabbed know more about the shot than the jabbed. Duh.
[3:37:02.080 --> 3:37:05.120]  I've never met anybody that believed in the jab that knew anything about it.
[3:37:05.760 --> 3:37:07.600]  Can you imagine being one of those guys?
[3:37:07.600 --> 3:37:15.280]  Bizer knew the jab would give off spike proteins to the unjabbed. They called it occupational
[3:37:15.280 --> 3:37:22.160]  exposure in their own paperwork. All of this is documented. The study that came out about the
[3:37:22.160 --> 3:37:28.320]  unjabbed knowing more than the jabbed, I mean, really? Did they really need to even come out
[3:37:28.320 --> 3:37:36.000]  with a study? Give me a break. All of their lies are coming to the forefront. You don't even have
[3:37:36.000 --> 3:37:43.280]  to guess anymore. The mountain of evidence we have, this high. The mountain of evidence they have,
[3:37:43.280 --> 3:37:50.160]  the media telling you with their shiny faces and their fake teeth and their fake hair and showing
[3:37:50.160 --> 3:37:55.760]  you that they know what's up. No, they don't. They don't have any evidence except their TV
[3:37:55.760 --> 3:38:01.680]  expert doctor. So we actually have it a little easier than you think we do because the lies are
[3:38:01.680 --> 3:38:05.440]  so apparent. People are prepping, they're growing their own food, they're leaving their jobs,
[3:38:05.440 --> 3:38:14.640]  they're resisting. Pockets are resisting. Right? You know what's interesting too is Alex Newman,
[3:38:14.640 --> 3:38:20.800]  my guest this last week, had an interesting point on the show. He said, you know, he said,
[3:38:20.800 --> 3:38:27.040]  after almost two years, nobody is going to the side of Fauci and Biden. King fraud a lot. Nobody is
[3:38:27.040 --> 3:38:33.360]  going to little Hitler man and King fraud a lot. No one. They're not gaining any support.
[3:38:33.360 --> 3:38:41.600]  They're losing people to support of the other side, which means that their case is falling short.
[3:38:42.240 --> 3:38:48.480]  They got a little too desperate, didn't they? A little too desperate. And so it's falling apart.
[3:38:48.480 --> 3:38:53.760]  It's getting easier to see. You're seeing more and more people that have a lot more logic and
[3:38:53.760 --> 3:38:59.040]  a lot more common sense that are going, oh, wait a minute here. How can we have four variants? I
[3:38:59.040 --> 3:39:03.360]  take a shot and it doesn't work. And I have to take four more shots. Something about that
[3:39:03.360 --> 3:39:10.400]  isn't set well with me. Let me go get my common sense on. So I find it kind of interesting that
[3:39:10.400 --> 3:39:16.560]  at this time in history, they're losing their audience. Isn't that great though? Because
[3:39:16.560 --> 3:39:23.680]  three fourths of the country knows their fraud. Three fourths of the country knows the truth.
[3:39:23.680 --> 3:39:30.160]  Do you know how amazing that is? The revolutionary times didn't have that advantage.
[3:39:31.040 --> 3:39:35.120]  They didn't have the advantage of three fourths of the country understanding what was going on.
[3:39:36.480 --> 3:39:40.480]  Our only problem is that we don't know how to get together to fight it. That's our problem.
[3:39:41.280 --> 3:39:46.400]  Our problem is we don't know how to join. We don't know how to become that force.
[3:39:46.400 --> 3:39:52.800]  Is it a civil war? Is it using the Constitution in the courtroom? There are a lot of different ways
[3:39:52.800 --> 3:39:57.840]  to fight this. I think a lot of ways with humor that actually wake up people more so
[3:39:58.320 --> 3:40:03.680]  than anything else. And we'll talk about that for a second. But some of my most interesting
[3:40:03.680 --> 3:40:12.640]  guests in 10 years of radio have been the guests that escaped. Their country escaped. Their country
[3:40:12.640 --> 3:40:19.440]  was able to do the damage to the deep state and win. I will never forget having Harold Ziegler
[3:40:19.440 --> 3:40:26.480]  on. He escaped East Germany. And you know what the situation there was? They had very, very small
[3:40:26.480 --> 3:40:33.600]  groups. And inside those small groups, one person in that small group would know where another group,
[3:40:33.600 --> 3:40:41.280]  a very small group, was getting together in more closed door meetings, shall we say. And only
[3:40:41.280 --> 3:40:46.240]  that one person knew about this other group. And from that group, only one person knew about the
[3:40:46.240 --> 3:40:51.920]  other group, right? And all of those groups were able to communicate, just having one person within
[3:40:51.920 --> 3:40:56.880]  their very small group be able to be the liaison to the other group so that they could communicate
[3:40:56.880 --> 3:41:03.120]  without getting caught. And what they did was they called for people to walk around the churches
[3:41:03.600 --> 3:41:09.600]  in mass. And people started going and they started a thousand and then it became five
[3:41:09.600 --> 3:41:15.520]  thousand and then it became 10,000 people walking around the churches. And we're talking full
[3:41:15.520 --> 3:41:22.080]  oppression, full oppression. You can't get more oppression than this. And as they walked around
[3:41:22.080 --> 3:41:27.280]  the church with the optics, they knew that they couldn't just start shooting people, right? They
[3:41:27.280 --> 3:41:31.680]  couldn't just go into violence. The people were walking around a church for Pete's sakes.
[3:41:33.440 --> 3:41:39.280]  And so what did they do? They just kept walking in mass. And finally, they had to roll over
[3:41:39.280 --> 3:41:46.160]  over. They had to realize that there was enough people walking around those churches
[3:41:47.680 --> 3:41:54.400]  in protest that they were going to lose the battle. And I always find stories like that amazing
[3:41:54.400 --> 3:42:00.240]  because it took people with some ingenuity, but it also took a lot of people joining in.
[3:42:00.240 --> 3:42:04.480]  That's exactly what happened during that revolutionary battle. They were joined by
[3:42:04.480 --> 3:42:10.000]  people for help. People were inspired by their fight to go on, the suffering,
[3:42:10.720 --> 3:42:16.880]  and they decided to join them. And that's the only reason they became enough presence to ward off
[3:42:16.880 --> 3:42:25.280]  the British. Isn't that amazing? And then at East Germany, the same thing. Too many people
[3:42:25.280 --> 3:42:31.920]  protesting together, too many people saying what they wanted to say, and really without even words
[3:42:31.920 --> 3:42:38.560]  it's made such an impact in the time. But it was because of that that we can learn what we need
[3:42:38.560 --> 3:42:44.640]  to be doing now. And there's so much that we can do now. So I want you to celebrate Christmas.
[3:42:44.640 --> 3:42:48.640]  I want you to have the passion behind it. And I want you to do it right because you know what?
[3:42:49.280 --> 3:42:54.240]  It scares them that we have a faith higher than them, right?
[3:42:54.240 --> 3:43:04.240]  Right? Rarely in life you come upon something that is an absolute 360 win. And this is a 360
[3:43:04.240 --> 3:43:10.800]  win situation for everybody that loves liberty, that loves health, that loves being informed,

[3:44:00.640 --> 3:44:07.040]  of the planet's ruling class, not in communist china, not in mexico, not in the united states,
[3:44:07.040 --> 3:44:13.200]  not anywhere. Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class? And that's done by design.
[3:44:13.920 --> 3:44:19.280]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[3:44:19.280 --> 3:44:24.240]  that look into, say, the Anglo-american establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg
[3:44:24.240 --> 3:44:28.080]  group, the trilateral commission of the united nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds
[3:44:28.080 --> 3:44:33.920]  and the rock folks. Until 10 years ago, the media said the control corporate media of the Bilderberg
[3:44:33.920 --> 3:44:39.360]  group didn't exist. Well, now the Bilderberg group is public in its former head, still on the
[3:44:39.360 --> 3:44:44.640]  steering committee, is Klaus Schwab, and he has set up the great reset in global government,
[3:44:44.640 --> 3:44:49.760]  and if as a liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head on about the
[3:44:49.760 --> 3:44:54.320]  second to your worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot. We do expose them,
[3:44:54.320 --> 3:44:59.040]  we can beat them easily. I have come to you countless times over the last 28 years and asked

[3:45:09.840 --> 3:45:14.800]  intellectually, spiritually, and at a gut level, that all hell has already broken loose, and it's
[3:45:14.800 --> 3:45:19.840]  about to get 10 times worse. But this is the time that tries men and women's souls, and this is the

[3:46:57.120 --> 3:47:06.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:06.640 --> 3:47:19.040]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host in this hour, so grateful to Alex and his show for waking people
[3:47:19.040 --> 3:47:24.400]  up all around the world. It's truly amazing, all the feedback I get, the letters I get,
[3:47:24.960 --> 3:47:31.840]  and so appreciative of people wanting to wake people up and having that desire. And you know
[3:47:31.840 --> 3:47:38.000]  what? You ought to feel like you're in a pretty good crowd. You're awake. What a huge blessing
[3:47:38.000 --> 3:47:45.200]  that is right now. You know, this today is the Christmas message of resistance. Sounds strange,
[3:47:45.200 --> 3:47:54.480]  doesn't it? But even Christ's parents resisted. Even Christ resisted. His birth ought to be
[3:47:54.480 --> 3:48:02.800]  celebrated. His birth is that important to who we are as people. Important to me. And so I do a
[3:48:02.800 --> 3:48:09.040]  lot of shows about how can we do this? How can we take that energy that we're feeling from hearing
[3:48:09.040 --> 3:48:14.720]  the headlines and take it and put it into something that's going to matter? Because I know that you
[3:48:14.720 --> 3:48:20.960]  and I, that's really what we want, right? We want to have that same fortitude and that same
[3:48:20.960 --> 3:48:26.320]  perseverance as those guys on the battlefield. We're just not a different battlefield is all.
[3:48:27.040 --> 3:48:32.640]  Our battlefield right now is a little more comfortable, but full of resistance in a different
[3:48:32.640 --> 3:48:38.560]  way. And all of us are going to end up having to sacrifice. We know that, right? I ended up,
[3:48:38.560 --> 3:48:44.320]  I was on a Fox News affiliate, ended up having to leave and own my own show in order to tell the
[3:48:44.320 --> 3:48:52.000]  truth. It's what happens. You make a sacrifice, but then a window's open. And when that window is
[3:48:52.000 --> 3:49:01.040]  open for you, it's pretty wonderful. I think everybody has a story in which they've failed at
[3:49:01.040 --> 3:49:05.680]  some point. But then the failure brought about the biggest blessing. I was just watching a show
[3:49:05.680 --> 3:49:12.560]  about Lucille Ball for all people. And she wanted to be an RKO starlet, right? It wasn't in the
[3:49:12.560 --> 3:49:17.440]  cards for her. She wanted it though. I'm sure she prayed for it. I'm sure that that's all her
[3:49:17.440 --> 3:49:24.480]  focus was on. It's all she cared about. But she had to fail at it in order to become one of the
[3:49:24.480 --> 3:49:31.440]  biggest media people, totally reinventing TV, the sitcom, bringing humor to a lot of people's
[3:49:31.440 --> 3:49:38.000]  lives, clean humor, might I add, and which is refreshing. And you know what? That window would
[3:49:38.000 --> 3:49:44.320]  have never been opened for her had she not failed. So this Christmas, instead of concentrating on
[3:49:44.320 --> 3:49:50.480]  our own stuff, our own junk, our own failures, concentrate on all the things that make miracles
[3:49:50.480 --> 3:49:56.560]  happen, the possibilities, maybe you're handed a situation in which you need to leave your job
[3:49:56.560 --> 3:50:02.640]  right now. And it's scary and you don't know how to pay the bills. But if you're not one of many
[3:50:02.640 --> 3:50:10.400]  doing that, it's not going to matter anyway. We lose it all anyway. So know that you are on the
[3:50:10.400 --> 3:50:16.960]  forefront in history of somebody that's already sacrificing for everyone else's liberty. It's
[3:50:16.960 --> 3:50:23.120]  huge. What a huge gift. And know that windows could be opened in ways that you never thought.
[3:50:23.840 --> 3:50:30.480]  Failure is just part of the story. We got to get used to it. Failure and stress and trials,
[3:50:30.480 --> 3:50:34.240]  we almost should welcome them. Stuff, I know, but we should welcome them.
[3:50:35.680 --> 3:50:40.320]  And to do things with humor, you know, there was a little story about a woman resisting
[3:50:40.320 --> 3:50:48.480]  a Nazi officer brushed past this little gray haired aristocratic looking old lady. And she
[3:50:48.480 --> 3:50:55.760]  raised her cane and she knocked off his hat. And she berated him loudly for showing so little
[3:50:55.760 --> 3:51:03.200]  respect for his elders. And embarrassed, he apologized quickly. And he and she continued
[3:51:03.200 --> 3:51:10.080]  her little tirade until he fled. He was a Nazi officer for Pete's Sakes. The little old lady
[3:51:10.080 --> 3:51:16.480]  went on about her business, laughing to herself. And she said, Well, we'll all have to fight this
[3:51:16.480 --> 3:51:21.280]  war as best we can. That's the fourth hat I've knocked into the mud this morning.
[3:51:21.280 --> 3:51:29.840]  Don't you love that? That's the attitude we all need to have. Humor can sometimes break down
[3:51:29.840 --> 3:51:35.120]  some of the barriers between even the groups, even in this resistance, right?
[3:51:36.880 --> 3:51:42.400]  And sometimes it's kind of what we need to be able to see and to be able to kind of see a
[3:51:42.400 --> 3:51:49.840]  little bit more clearly and sort of join forces. There's an old joke about two Romanians on a bus.
[3:51:49.840 --> 3:51:53.440]  One is sitting down, the other is standing. And the sitting man asks,
[3:51:54.160 --> 3:51:58.960]  are you a member of the Communist Party? He says, No, I am not. Are you in the military?
[3:51:59.600 --> 3:52:06.160]  No, I am not. You mean you're not a government or party official of any kind? No, I am not.
[3:52:06.160 --> 3:52:14.000]  Then get the hell off my foot. I love that story. I love that story because it's humor that can
[3:52:14.000 --> 3:52:20.960]  actually help us right now in so many ways if we just get together to do it. And there's a function
[3:52:20.960 --> 3:52:29.440]  of humor that I don't know what it is. And I love the fact that we can laugh a lot about these
[3:52:29.440 --> 3:52:35.360]  headlines and we can poke fun at King Fraud a lot who doesn't even know his name. And I doubt
[3:52:35.360 --> 3:52:42.240]  he's ever actually where he says he is. He's green screened quite a bit. I always wonder what
[3:52:42.240 --> 3:52:45.200]  they're doing with him. Do they just pull him out of the freezer when they want him to talk?
[3:52:45.200 --> 3:52:51.520]  I don't know. Who's in his earpiece? Who knows? The guy's a joke. He's fun to make fun of.
[3:52:51.520 --> 3:52:57.040]  And really and truly, every time I hear, let's go Brandon, I smile a little bit. I love it.
[3:52:57.040 --> 3:53:02.880]  Are you kidding me? This is fantastic. Every time I see the final variant is Communism.
[3:53:02.880 --> 3:53:06.560]  That's funny. But guess what? It's the funny that makes people think.
[3:53:06.560 --> 3:53:14.640]  And whether you provide a resistance of walking around the church, whether you provide a resistance
[3:53:14.640 --> 3:53:21.840]  of humor, it all works. It all works. And the reason I brought up personal failures and things
[3:53:21.840 --> 3:53:28.400]  that we grapple with is right now it's a really easy time to get stuck in the weeds into our own
[3:53:28.400 --> 3:53:33.840]  stuff where we think we're climbing these mountains every day. And maybe some of us are.
[3:53:33.840 --> 3:53:39.280]  But at the same time, we've got to put that stuff aside and have a little bit more faith and a little
[3:53:39.280 --> 3:53:46.160]  bit less fear about the future. And Christmas Day, the celebration of Christmas, honestly should
[3:53:46.160 --> 3:53:53.200]  remind us of all of that, right? He was one of the biggest resistors of government. They honestly
[3:53:53.200 --> 3:54:02.480]  had to kill him to get him to stop talking. We're the truth tellers in society. We can poke fun
[3:54:02.480 --> 3:54:07.840]  because it kind of relieves some of the stress, but it makes people see things a little clearer.
[3:54:08.720 --> 3:54:13.920]  We have to get out of just being so focused on our own failures and our own problems
[3:54:15.280 --> 3:54:20.800]  that it doesn't bring us down to the point that we stop fighting. We've got to keep fighting.
[3:54:21.840 --> 3:54:26.560]  And this is a great time to fill the coffers, isn't it? It's a great time to kind of fill that void
[3:54:26.560 --> 3:54:34.640]  and say, you know what? People have been in worse situations than us. Dealing with less than us.
[3:54:37.200 --> 3:54:43.840]  So right now, we have it pretty comfortable. And this is the time to use all the mediums that we
[3:54:43.840 --> 3:54:48.560]  can, social media, whatever the case may be. Twitter told me the other day, we miss you.
[3:54:49.440 --> 3:54:55.120]  Well, I don't miss you. I don't want to be on Twitter, but there are places I do want to be.
[3:54:55.120 --> 3:55:00.480]  And I'm happy to give those messages. And I'm happy to uplift and help where I can,
[3:55:00.480 --> 3:55:07.600]  because I know that it's got to be sort of a marriage between hope and between the real,
[3:55:07.600 --> 3:55:13.920]  hard-hitting things that we need to know about in this life. But there's always got to be hope.
[3:55:14.800 --> 3:55:19.440]  And you know what? We have mounds of it. We have a whole history. The people in history
[3:55:19.440 --> 3:55:23.920]  didn't even have history. Think about that for a minute. They did not have the history of people
[3:55:23.920 --> 3:55:31.840]  to learn from. We do. I can look back at Harold Ziegler. I can look back at that woman. Confronting
[3:55:31.840 --> 3:55:36.960]  the Nazi officer. I can look back at many situations where we had the opportunity
[3:55:37.840 --> 3:55:45.200]  to make people very awake, to get the masses to understand. And you might feel like a very
[3:55:45.200 --> 3:55:50.080]  small portion of people today, right? You might think that it's closing in on us and that the
[3:55:50.080 --> 3:55:54.560]  people aren't awake and that all these people are falling for all these fake media messages
[3:55:54.560 --> 3:56:02.080]  and the green screens and the lies and all the rest. You might think that. And a portion of
[3:56:02.080 --> 3:56:09.680]  that might be true. But the problem is, is that we don't grasp the fact that the truth has always
[3:56:09.680 --> 3:56:17.840]  run with a smaller crowd than the masses. That's why they call them the asses. I love that story.
[3:56:17.840 --> 3:56:28.000]  Anyway, but it's true though, right? So this Christmas, I hope that you celebrate with passion.
[3:56:28.960 --> 3:56:35.040]  I hope that you celebrate to the hilt. I hope that you remember what's important. I hope that
[3:56:35.040 --> 3:56:41.600]  we're focused on our liberty, our God, our country, our relationships. I hope that we do everything
[3:56:41.600 --> 3:56:47.120]  we can do to preserve this liberty. What a gift we've been given. We're not used to fighting for it
[3:56:47.120 --> 3:56:55.440]  all the time. We're not. And it's tough to suddenly think, oh my gosh, so much is at stake. And it is.
[3:56:55.440 --> 3:57:04.480]  The headlines are terrifying. But you know what? We also have God. And I'm sorry, but anything he
[3:57:04.480 --> 3:57:09.760]  can do is much stronger and much better than whatever they've been able to conceive or pull
[3:57:09.760 --> 3:57:14.320]  out of their hat or try to do to us. Because all through history I have examples of this.
[3:57:14.320 --> 3:57:22.880]  This Christmas, let's just focus on the miracle of Christmas and know that more miracles are to
[3:57:22.880 --> 3:57:27.840]  come. And you and I are important to what's happening right now. He's counting on us. He has
[3:57:27.840 --> 3:57:34.160]  confidence in us. So we need to have confidence back. Merry Christmas to all of you. Merry Christmas
[3:57:34.160 --> 3:57:46.240]  to Alex. Merry Christmas to everybody at InfoWars. Thanks, you guys. Kate Daly. It's hard to believe
[3:57:46.240 --> 3:57:54.320]  that Christmas 2021 is here and soon will be in the year 2022. Everything the globalist
[3:57:54.320 --> 3:58:03.440]  plan on doing, their entire operations hinge on you psychologically not understanding that
[3:58:03.440 --> 3:58:09.360]  they're trying to break your will, that they're trying to drive you into submission. But if you're
[3:58:09.360 --> 3:58:14.960]  aware of this basic fact and how they are scientifically controlling you, then you're
[3:58:14.960 --> 3:58:21.920]  basically immune. This is next level information on how to take control of your mind. It's how
[3:58:21.920 --> 3:58:26.000]  I've been able to stand against the incredible attacks they've carried out because I'm able to
[3:58:26.000 --> 3:58:33.200]  connect to the divine. I'm able to transcend this dimension simply by becoming aware of the fact
[3:58:33.200 --> 3:58:39.280]  that I already transcended it. So until Christmas day, we're offering reset wars, our incredible
[3:58:39.280 --> 3:58:47.440]  two-part course for 25% off at resetwars.com. If you're ruthless mega corporations who've taken
[3:58:47.440 --> 3:58:52.720]  over almost every government on earth and who are trying to destroy the middle class and any form
[3:58:52.720 --> 3:58:56.720]  of upper gobility, you've got to divide and conquer the public so they don't know they're
[3:58:56.720 --> 3:59:03.440]  being targeted. That's why the Fortune 100 have wrapped themselves, the name of LBGT and African
[3:59:03.440 --> 3:59:07.920]  American rights and all the rest of it, all over the world. That's now their corporate face while
[3:59:07.920 --> 3:59:13.120]  they run slave camps in Africa and in communist China and many other areas while they undermine
[3:59:13.120 --> 3:59:18.080]  our basic liberties here and spy on us through the big tech and the central banks in other
[3:59:18.080 --> 3:59:25.040]  zone. So this is a criminal takeover and when you look at the new superclass, it's the politicians,
[3:59:25.040 --> 3:59:30.160]  it's the corporate media, it's the police, it's the bureaucrats, it's members of congress and their
[3:59:30.160 --> 3:59:35.360]  staff and their families, it's the White House, hell it's postal workers who were all exempt
[3:59:35.360 --> 3:59:41.760]  from the poison shots but not the general public and everybody else through corporate rule. So this
[3:59:41.760 --> 3:59:44.400]  is the true discrimination that's coming on.
[3:59:44.400 --> 4:00:08.400]  Bye.
