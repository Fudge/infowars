[00:00.000 --> 00:08.240]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08.240 --> 00:23.280]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:23.280 --> 00:27.400]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and thank you so much for joining us on this Wednesday
[00:27.400 --> 00:32.080]  26th day of May 2010 Addition.
[00:32.080 --> 00:38.560]  Congressman Ron Paul is going to be joining us coming up in about 25 minutes from now.
[00:38.560 --> 00:47.320]  We also have Walter Burian who's the progenitor of the amazing revelation that government
[00:47.320 --> 00:54.360]  has a second set of books known as the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report set up off of the Chicago
[00:54.360 --> 01:02.320]  Al Capone model and this is hidden in plain view like the chemtrailing, the CIA growing
[01:02.320 --> 01:08.480]  the poppies with the Marines and Army as farmers in Afghanistan.
[01:08.480 --> 01:13.000]  Everything is just out in the open in everyone's face.
[01:13.000 --> 01:19.920]  The system just flots all of this right in our face.
[01:19.920 --> 01:27.280]  And so we're going to be discussing that coming up on the syndicated radio broadcast today.
[01:27.280 --> 01:36.000]  The websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[01:36.000 --> 01:45.480]  Now I was just marveling at an article in the Washington Post yesterday we're buried
[01:45.480 --> 01:53.400]  in the story, they just calmly report that they faked the bin Laden videos.
[01:53.400 --> 01:58.840]  Well of course those were fake videos, it wasn't even the same person and they had linguists
[01:58.840 --> 02:02.840]  listen to the voice, it wasn't even the same dialect and they had voice prints made of
[02:02.840 --> 02:08.840]  real bin Laden interviews versus the new fake interviews and they were all fake.
[02:08.840 --> 02:18.680]  But here they are in the news in an article titled CIA unit's wacky idea depicts Saddam
[02:18.680 --> 02:25.720]  as gay and then buried in that story like letting you know passing gas in church they
[02:25.720 --> 02:31.840]  just kind of sneak it out there and hope nobody notices kind of like the same thing with the
[02:31.840 --> 02:35.480]  opium oh it's coming out our troops are growing the opium over there and they don't like it
[02:35.480 --> 02:37.880]  we'll just come out and admit we're doing it.
[02:37.880 --> 02:44.760]  This is the new psychological tactic more than ever.
[02:44.760 --> 02:49.480]  And so we're going to be going over that also another bizarre story here Fort Worth police
[02:49.480 --> 02:53.560]  chief promotes hormone therapy.
[02:53.560 --> 02:58.840]  Now it's come out that the group abusing steroids more than any other population is police and
[02:58.840 --> 03:02.960]  there's no wonder there's so much police brutality and police going crazy and having
[03:02.960 --> 03:11.640]  roid rages on old ladies small children you name it no police you do not need to have
[03:11.640 --> 03:17.800]  hormone therapy what you need is to be in control of yourself I mean I can't imagine
[03:17.800 --> 03:24.320]  what would happen if I took steroids ladies and gentlemen I mean I every week I want to
[03:24.320 --> 03:29.760]  tear somebody's head off okay I can barely control myself with the testosterone I have
[03:29.760 --> 03:37.800]  I cannot imagine taking more testosterone I cannot imagine what that would be like and
[03:37.800 --> 03:42.320]  I see these police all over the place roided out of their minds you can tell they've got
[03:42.320 --> 03:48.200]  the camel hump on their back they've got that watery fat muscle you can tell when somebody's
[03:48.200 --> 03:54.520]  on steroids and if you've ever played football or been in and around sports and you could
[03:54.520 --> 04:00.280]  see when somebody's on roids and you're you've been to the gym you can tell who's on roids
[04:00.280 --> 04:06.320]  and it's just a large portion of police are on steroids and that's not even one of our
[04:06.320 --> 04:11.560]  top stories I don't even know why I'm why I'm even getting into that North Korea severs
[04:11.560 --> 04:17.560]  all ties with the south and says they're preparing for war the south says that if one ship crosses
[04:17.560 --> 04:21.600]  into their waters they're going to attack the north has got all this artillery lined
[04:21.600 --> 04:26.760]  up to blast seol the capital of South Korea they're openly talking about world war three
[04:26.760 --> 04:32.920]  Israel's talking about going into Iran we've got a scientific dictatorship Kim trailing
[04:32.920 --> 04:45.440]  the atmosphere poisoning our water supply and it's almost a diversion it's almost a
[04:45.440 --> 04:51.680]  distraction to talk about Obama being born in Kenya and being an Indonesian citizen
[04:51.680 --> 04:57.720]  it's all true of course it's almost a diversion to talk about socialist and communist and fascist
[04:57.720 --> 05:10.560]  and it's far worse than that it is a scientific dictatorship that we're in and it just burns
[05:10.560 --> 05:28.560]  into my brain every day just how far down the rat hole we are as a society and I'm
[05:28.560 --> 05:34.240]  not trying to be negative here I'm trying to be honest about it I mean I love the good
[05:34.240 --> 05:38.480]  things about our society I love all the beautiful things all the innocent things all the nice
[05:38.480 --> 05:42.800]  things and quite frankly I don't even like having to focus in all this new order news
[05:42.800 --> 05:49.240]  but it's got to be done because clearly in history once corruption goes to seed once
[05:49.240 --> 06:01.720]  it reaches a critical point it just runs completely wild on everyone and so we're going to discuss
[06:01.720 --> 06:08.560]  all these issues today I mean just some of the other news I've got here Obama's health care
[06:08.560 --> 06:21.320]  rationing czar and it's all these quotes out of a biotechnology health care review where
[06:21.320 --> 06:26.480]  they're talking about how they're going to ration care I mean all of the Obama people
[06:26.480 --> 06:30.760]  and all of the Clinton people is said they wanted socialist health care and that they
[06:30.760 --> 06:35.400]  were then going to ration care and this is what they do in every other country and they
[06:35.400 --> 06:39.720]  sit there and deny and lie during the passage and now that it's passed they just admit it
[06:39.720 --> 06:47.400]  it's a bunch of control freaks running our lives controlling every facet of our society
[06:47.400 --> 06:56.280]  so we'll be breaking breaking that report down as well today on the economic front I
[06:56.280 --> 07:03.360]  don't have to tell you that things are worse than bad they're they're out of control all
[07:03.360 --> 07:07.520]  over Europe they're announcing that they are taking large portions of the public's pension
[07:07.520 --> 07:16.560]  funds raising taxes same thing beginning here in the U.S. Moody's is reiterating that
[07:16.560 --> 07:23.280]  U.S. spending risk credit rating that we may become basically like a third world nation
[07:23.280 --> 07:28.720]  so that when our government borrows money from the private central banks that they make
[07:28.720 --> 07:35.680]  up out of nothing they just write a blank check saying they own the world that when
[07:35.680 --> 07:41.360]  this happens that when they lower our credit rating we'll have to pay higher interest to
[07:41.360 --> 07:47.680]  the bankers for made up currency and credit so I've got that here in my stack Moody's
[07:47.680 --> 07:54.160]  reiterates U.S. spending risk credit rating that at risk losing the credit rating lowering
[07:54.160 --> 08:00.160]  it Romanians protest wage and pension cuts same thing going on in Greece in Germany
[08:00.160 --> 08:06.000]  everywhere 25 questions to ask anyone who is delusional enough to believe that the economy
[08:06.000 --> 08:10.400]  is really in a recovery and that it's real I'm gonna go over that good points made and
[08:10.400 --> 08:14.680]  I mentioned this yesterday but I want to spend more time on this coming up when Ron Paul
[08:14.680 --> 08:28.160]  joins us private pay shrinks to historic lows as government payout rises so you're being
[08:28.160 --> 08:36.240]  paid record low wages on average and you're paying record high taxes but government jobs
[08:36.240 --> 08:42.160]  are increasing in all time records and they're all getting raises like a cancer jumping from
[08:42.160 --> 08:48.800]  the lungs to the liver to the pancreas to the kidneys to the brain it just it's a wonderland
[08:48.800 --> 08:53.760]  cancer is just spreading it's nothing can stand in its way it's it's having such a
[08:53.760 --> 09:00.440]  wonderful time and there's a method of the madness they say they want to destroy our
[09:00.440 --> 09:07.480]  society and rebuild it order out of chaos so private pay shrinks historic lows as government
[09:07.480 --> 09:11.560]  payouts rise that's USA today and they're just announcing their great success it's
[09:11.560 --> 09:17.520]  a great victory in the enslavement of the people kind of like the dumber the kids get
[09:17.520 --> 09:22.040]  in school the more dumb down the lower the test scores the more federal funding a job
[09:22.040 --> 09:29.640]  well done just like George Carlin said I'll tell you why education is never gonna get
[09:29.640 --> 09:33.160]  any better it's only gonna get worse because people that own this country there's a big
[09:33.160 --> 09:38.920]  club and you ain't in it they want you dumb they want you obedient little servants and
[09:38.920 --> 09:44.120]  they think you're so dumb they have CSI shows where anybody that questions fluoride in the
[09:44.120 --> 09:48.160]  water or chemtrails they're spraying on us and they admit they're spraying now is a
[09:48.160 --> 09:55.200]  terrorist that wants to murder people and you know I realize my cracking up on air my
[09:55.200 --> 09:59.920]  flipping out my freaking out is normal and wholesome and good I am normal we should be
[09:59.920 --> 10:04.840]  upset about what's going on the fact that people can just sit there calmly or our societal
[10:04.840 --> 10:10.720]  house is burning down is disgusting we need to get angry we need to get aggressive we
[10:10.720 --> 10:15.760]  need to get outspoken we need to let the fur fly folks we need to wake up these brain dead
[10:15.760 --> 10:21.360]  zombies that have no idea what's going on to them we need to reach out to these people
[10:21.360 --> 10:28.240]  and get real that's why it's so exhausting now these days do four hours radio because
[10:28.240 --> 10:33.760]  it's so real to me there is no enjoyment in ego there is no enjoyment being the big radio
[10:33.760 --> 10:39.080]  host and having all this success there is no enjoyment in anything anymore except standing
[10:39.080 --> 10:47.040]  up against the globalist and that's not enjoyable it's just raw instinct and it disgusts me
[10:47.040 --> 10:51.640]  that I'm not up to the job but compared to the rest of the public I'm the it makes me
[10:51.640 --> 10:57.960]  sick that I'm the best there is it's disgusting and I want to do more to fight these people
[10:57.960 --> 11:03.680]  I mean look at this treason I've been talking about this since last week top official says
[11:03.680 --> 11:08.960]  feds may not process illegals referred from Arizona folks they for years they won't come
[11:08.960 --> 11:14.600]  pick up illegals that have committed crimes from city and county jails and state prisons
[11:14.600 --> 11:18.840]  I remember four years ago was in the Houston Chronicle that a quarter million plus people
[11:18.840 --> 11:23.560]  in the past three years before that had been released out of Texas prisons who are illegal
[11:23.560 --> 11:28.360]  aliens who'd committed violent crimes and they were just released because the feds wouldn't
[11:28.360 --> 11:34.080]  come to port them because the feds love criminals running around engaging in crime so the public
[11:34.080 --> 11:41.040]  will all crap their drawers and beg the SWAT teams to come rule over them excuse me you
[11:41.040 --> 11:46.440]  got a murdering sicko group a filthy trash running the government that loves screwing
[11:46.440 --> 11:52.960]  everything up and love destroying society face up to that face up to the raw sick control

[16:26.600 --> 16:31.680]  even make me happy to expose him it enrages me with disgust you know the type of anger
[16:31.680 --> 16:39.480]  where you're not even angry with the people you're just completely opposed to everything
[16:39.480 --> 16:50.400]  they are at a title elemental tectonic level of your psyche I mean it disgusts me beyond
[16:50.400 --> 16:59.320]  belief that Jeff Steins spy talk in the Washington Post they just calmly announced yeah we faked
[16:59.320 --> 17:06.760]  bin Laden videos they just bury it in the article I mean that that that sends me into
[17:06.760 --> 17:14.920]  convulsions of anger because now they're practicing the evil out on the open just like they practice
[17:14.920 --> 17:19.880]  torture right when they thought they had you all afraid after they stage 9 11 the globalist
[17:19.880 --> 17:22.320]  that came out and said yeah we're torturing people's kids in front of their parents and
[17:22.320 --> 17:27.440]  that good to try to bring you over to the dark side they know exactly what they're doing
[17:27.440 --> 17:39.240]  and I am just I don't like having it flaunted okay I've had enough and I'm sick of them
[17:39.240 --> 17:44.120]  up there like a bunch of snakes knowing they're lying implying that Senator Inhofe is a white
[17:44.120 --> 17:49.860]  supremacist with no evidence because he doesn't believe in manmade global warming or saying
[17:49.860 --> 17:54.760]  that Rand Paul is a racist because he said people ought to be able to have private clubs
[17:54.760 --> 18:01.560]  when he was asked just just just that just how they sell their religion of multiculturalism
[18:01.560 --> 18:06.480]  when it's all a eugenics based garbage I mean look at this former CIA officials admit to
[18:06.480 --> 18:12.960]  faking bin Laden video military psyops took over operation after intelligence project
[18:12.960 --> 18:19.280]  failed to take off two former CIA officials have admitted to creating a fake video in
[18:19.280 --> 18:25.240]  which intelligence officials dressed up as Osama bin Laden and his cronies in an effort
[18:25.240 --> 18:29.760]  to defame the terrorist leader throughout the Middle East the details are outlined the
[18:29.760 --> 18:34.520]  Washington Post article by investigative reporter former army intelligence case officer yeah
[18:34.520 --> 18:39.160]  just like Woodward Bob Woodward was naval intelligence and Alexander Hague Fetty and
[18:39.160 --> 18:43.440]  all the stuff about Nixon because Nixon made the globalist mad I'm not saying Nixon was
[18:43.440 --> 18:48.480]  good but that was all staged entire Washington Post is Builderburg new order run the details
[18:48.480 --> 18:53.440]  are outlined in Washington Post article by investigative reporter and former army intelligence
[18:53.440 --> 19:00.680]  case officer Jeff Stein Stein sources told him that during planning for the 2003 invasion
[19:00.680 --> 19:07.040]  of Iraq the CIA's Iraq operations group considered creating a fake video of Saddam Hussein engaging
[19:07.040 --> 19:11.440]  in sexual acts with a teenage boy then flooding Iraq with copies of the tape the idea along
[19:11.440 --> 19:15.600]  with faking Iraq news bulletins never came to fruition that's not true they admit Iraq
[19:15.600 --> 19:21.840]  news bulletins are fake now according to CIA former officials because arrangement and agreement
[19:21.840 --> 19:25.800]  on the project cannot be reached between the Iraq group and CIA's official technical service
[19:25.800 --> 19:31.160]  how however the two sources reveal the agency did previously concoct at least one fake bin
[19:31.160 --> 19:38.200]  laden video and they add this incredible plumplet this incredible little plumplet right in the
[19:38.200 --> 19:43.520]  middle of the story now if you ever read this to a bug I'd know it all yuppie they're just
[19:43.520 --> 19:48.000]  going to tell you the Washington Post doesn't exist this is all part of the sickening flaunting
[19:48.000 --> 19:51.760]  I've seen scores of articles the last week even by neocomp publications saying there's
[19:51.760 --> 19:59.000]  no North American Union there's no SPP there's no trans-Texas corridor it's all made up when
[19:59.000 --> 20:02.240]  I've got all the government documents and have watched them build the stinking thing
[20:02.240 --> 20:09.560]  oh yeah they changed the name what did AP report last year Rick Perry has canceled the
[20:09.560 --> 20:14.520]  Texas trans-Texas corridor but he's just renamed it it says the agency actually did
[20:14.520 --> 20:18.160]  make a video purporting to show someone bin laden and his crony sitting around a campfire
[20:18.160 --> 20:23.680]  swinging bottles of liquor and savoring their conquest with boys one of the former CIA officials
[20:23.680 --> 20:29.280]  were called chuckling at the memory the actors were drawn from some of our darker skinned
[20:29.280 --> 20:36.400]  employees he said like the fat bin laden video that was proven to be fake I just have to sit
[20:36.400 --> 20:43.280]  here and watch them desecrate goodness and desecrate our country as if they're patriots
[20:43.280 --> 20:48.120]  and they think you're so stupid and so broke back and so pathetic that they get up on the
[20:48.120 --> 20:58.280]  news and say yeah we grow the opium now because if we don't al-qaeda will get it all right

[24:59.240 --> 25:10.120]  Well so much is going on we've only got him for about 20 minutes or so congressman ron
[25:10.120 --> 25:17.600]  paul I don't know how he does it legislation lobbing on the floor doing you know 10-15
[25:17.600 --> 25:24.720]  media events a day writing books running campaign for liberty supporting ran paul with the incredible
[25:24.720 --> 25:29.400]  realignment we're seeing politically but he does it and god bless him he's congressman
[25:29.400 --> 25:36.080]  ron paul I want to talk about Iran North Korea the economy the border situation I want to
[25:36.080 --> 25:42.880]  talk about so many issues with ron paul but a congressman from Texas joining us today
[25:42.880 --> 25:48.840]  a congressman first off the political realignment every incumbent whether it's specter a democrat
[25:48.840 --> 25:54.840]  or whether it's a republican for the first time in 20 years winning in Hawaii for the
[25:54.840 --> 26:00.600]  congress to your son ron paul with a 30 point you know defeat of the establishment republican
[26:00.600 --> 26:05.360]  have you ever seen a realignment like this because generally it's one political party
[26:05.360 --> 26:11.200]  or the other that is seeing massive losses but what I'm seeing is across the board incumbents
[26:11.200 --> 26:17.760]  and establishment candidates are being annihilated I think that's absolutely right this is different
[26:17.760 --> 26:22.000]  I think there's been periods of time when people get very frustrating like you indicate
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.880]  they might shift back and forth from one party to the other but right now they're unhappy
[26:26.880 --> 26:34.760]  with both parties but the real tragedy is that we don't have a good and I say this word
[26:34.760 --> 26:39.760]  cautiously a democratic process the democratic election the ability of parties to compete
[26:39.760 --> 26:45.640]  there's a monopoly controlled by the republicans and the democrats and since philosophically
[26:45.640 --> 26:51.960]  they're not too far apart they sort of gang up on anybody who wants to offer an alternative
[26:51.960 --> 26:57.080]  so if we have had a very strong third party so here all the way people talk about the
[26:57.080 --> 27:02.600]  tea party as if it's a party but it really isn't a party it's an alternative and that's
[27:02.600 --> 27:07.120]  why the mixture comes up because sometimes democrats are in trouble sometimes republicans
[27:07.120 --> 27:12.920]  are in trouble but there's no one party to fulfill the role that is is necessary and
[27:12.920 --> 27:17.760]  I don't think that's going to happen soon because the laws make it very difficult to
[27:17.760 --> 27:23.240]  get on ballots and the media doesn't allow people to get into the debates and this sort
[27:23.240 --> 27:30.560]  of thing so they're very very handicapped and I just think that we're going to see
[27:30.560 --> 27:35.760]  this messy situation but I think it's just great that people are unhappy they're very
[27:35.760 --> 27:40.920]  active they want changes and they're picking and choosing and they're sending a loud message
[27:40.920 --> 27:47.480]  and both parties are getting a little bit upset I mean republicans you know in one sense
[27:47.480 --> 27:51.960]  they say well these tea party people they're a little bit nuts we can't deal with them
[27:51.960 --> 27:56.440]  but then when they find out the tea party is a political force they say oh I guess we
[27:56.440 --> 28:02.600]  better deal with them so they're in a dilemma too but I think it'll work out as long as
[28:02.600 --> 28:07.600]  the people who are unhappy stick to their guns and say and try to agree on some basic
[28:07.600 --> 28:11.800]  principles we either have too much government or too little government we either spend too
[28:11.800 --> 28:15.400]  much money or too little a bit of spending money we either have a lousy foreign policy
[28:15.400 --> 28:19.240]  or we don't have it so I think those are the kind of things that we have to stick to our
[28:19.240 --> 28:25.280]  guns and be as consistent as possible and see what we can do to contribute to a positive
[28:25.280 --> 28:30.080]  change in this country there's no doubt congressman I want to get your breakdown on this that
[28:30.080 --> 28:35.000]  the establishment is scared though and they're going to pull out all the stops to try to
[28:35.000 --> 28:41.840]  demonize any type of true grassroots constitutionalist candidate I mean we're seeing them say if
[28:41.840 --> 28:45.960]  you're against the health care bill you must be a racist but I think they've overplayed
[28:45.960 --> 28:50.960]  their hand by running around like chickens with their heads cut off yeah and that's been
[28:50.960 --> 28:56.560]  around but it's around right now a whole lot because the tea party movement is so much
[28:56.560 --> 29:03.200]  bigger but I can remember in 1996 and I don't know exactly what you were doing in 96 but
[29:03.200 --> 29:07.040]  when I was trying to get back in the congress both republicans and democrats said well this
[29:07.040 --> 29:12.240]  guy's crazy you know he doesn't he's even critical of the federal war on drugs anybody
[29:12.240 --> 29:17.160]  is critical on the war on the war on drugs must mean he wants to give drugs to kids you
[29:17.160 --> 29:22.200]  know that sort of thing so they tried real hard to demonize me then but I came back with
[29:22.200 --> 29:27.080]  honest answers said that now the war on drugs doesn't work I don't want to use drugs I don't
[29:27.080 --> 29:32.400]  want to use drugs on my kids I take care of women delivering babies to emphasize the evil
[29:32.400 --> 29:38.040]  and the harm of drugs you know we won that argument so they will always try to demonize
[29:38.040 --> 29:43.880]  individuals but more so today than ever before because like you say they were trying to turn
[29:43.880 --> 29:50.400]  it around that just because we oppose something that obama proposes oh you must be a racist
[29:50.400 --> 29:57.040]  you know it's a demagogues that it's the demagogues that really bug me but well in 96 I was interviewing
[29:57.040 --> 30:01.800]  you when you were getting back into office and I do remember that and they a few years
[30:01.800 --> 30:06.800]  ago had your head floating around out in space always trying to make you look like the outsider
[30:06.800 --> 30:12.680]  but as many newspapers have reported your views the constitution my views are now the
[30:12.680 --> 30:19.360]  majority view and the establishment is desperate and is very very afraid what else do you see
[30:19.360 --> 30:23.920]  them from your years of research and experiencing this in congress what else do you think the
[30:23.920 --> 30:29.120]  big central banks and others are going to do to try to keep control of the people I
[30:29.120 --> 30:34.760]  think whatever whatever they think is is necessary and I had some information passed
[30:34.760 --> 30:41.360]  on to me sort of inside information of somebody who knew somebody that was well tuned to the
[30:41.360 --> 30:46.240]  people at the Federal Reserve and they say they are really really concerned about our
[30:46.240 --> 30:50.520]  movement to expose the Fed for what they're doing not so much that they think tomorrow
[30:50.520 --> 30:54.040]  we're going to have a victory and have a thorough audit and the and the Fed is going
[30:54.040 --> 30:59.560]  to end but what they are upset or worried about is the fact that more and more people
[30:59.560 --> 31:05.800]  are aware of the Federal Reserve now and like never before an exposure is the most
[31:05.800 --> 31:10.400]  important thing then the changes will come and the reforms will come so they know exactly
[31:10.400 --> 31:14.040]  what we've been talking about I think that's where we've had such a tremendous success
[31:14.040 --> 31:19.800]  in the freedom movement in the last decade or so is that people have become aware of
[31:19.800 --> 31:24.400]  the power of the Federal Reserve and well I'm so delighted when I go to the universities
[31:24.400 --> 31:29.080]  and the next generation will know about the Federal Reserve the Federal Reserve was something
[31:29.080 --> 31:32.960]  you never even learned about in college I mean they just they just fluffed over this
[31:32.960 --> 31:37.760]  it was important they took care of it they knew how to run the economy that has ended
[31:37.760 --> 31:42.720]  and I think even those who defend the Fed are very frightened about it.
[31:42.720 --> 31:47.240]  Did you have a chance to see the big New Brzezinski speech to the CFR last week because he said
[31:47.240 --> 31:53.480]  for the first time in world history the planet is awake to us and our move for global government
[31:53.480 --> 31:56.560]  and he basically said we are in trouble.
[31:56.560 --> 32:02.160]  I didn't I didn't see that but I hope I hope he has some real reasons to be worried about
[32:02.160 --> 32:06.480]  that but was it Biden that said something the other day that Brussels should be the capital
[32:06.480 --> 32:09.040]  for the free world or something like that.
[32:09.040 --> 32:11.960]  Yeah they're really coming out in the open with their world government because we've
[32:11.960 --> 32:16.000]  exposed it and I want to run rapid fire now through a bunch of different issues while we
[32:16.000 --> 32:21.000]  have you very honored to have Congress from Ron Paul with us today live on the 26th day
[32:21.000 --> 32:23.800]  of May 2010.
[32:23.800 --> 32:30.400]  You mentioned the war on drugs I saw an interview with you back in the late 1980s and you were
[32:30.400 --> 32:35.800]  talking about the CIA who'd been caught chipping in heroin then and a few months ago you have
[32:35.800 --> 32:42.160]  a speech and said there's been a CIA coup in America since then it's been in the New
[32:42.160 --> 32:48.600]  York Times, the Washington Post, AFP, French news agency and even Geraldo Rivera on Fox
[32:48.600 --> 32:53.200]  they go yes our troops are helping grow the opium for the farmers because if they don't
[32:53.200 --> 32:55.640]  Al Qaeda will get it and sell it.
[32:55.640 --> 33:00.280]  What an amazing move to go from denying that they're producing it and shipping a lot of
[33:00.280 --> 33:05.200]  it in to saying oh yes we have to or Al Qaeda would get it well if you just decriminalized
[33:05.200 --> 33:10.360]  it that would take the money out and then Al Qaeda as they call it wouldn't I mean that
[33:10.360 --> 33:14.400]  was the excuse on the crack cocaine well we've got to ship the cocaine in or the communists
[33:14.400 --> 33:20.240]  you know we'll get the money can you speak to that sir well I don't have the absolute
[33:20.240 --> 33:25.920]  proof of it but my suspicion is and just because of the stories you hear I think they really
[33:25.920 --> 33:31.560]  want drugs to be illegal because I think that's the way they raise money for their governments
[33:31.560 --> 33:39.040]  is off the books you know they own banks they can get involved in enterprise and they have
[33:39.040 --> 33:44.080]  to get their cash and they did it never comes through well not all of it some of it will
[33:44.080 --> 33:47.920]  come through appropriations and legally even though we don't know where it goes and who
[33:47.920 --> 33:52.600]  controls it but they even need even more money because they're doing so much there's so much
[33:52.600 --> 34:00.240]  activity going on so in many ways they are very very powerful and they they it is in
[34:00.240 --> 34:04.720]  their interest to keep the drug war going so it's a bit of an irony that some very very
[34:04.720 --> 34:11.440]  sincere church believing people who want to take care of the kids believe that you know
[34:11.440 --> 34:17.400]  we have to keep this war going at the same time their allies inadvertently allies with
[34:17.400 --> 34:22.600]  the drug dealers who who want the drugs to be kept illegal and then then you point out
[34:22.600 --> 34:27.200]  well that the government the CIA is involved as well well congressman I know you're super
[34:27.200 --> 34:31.840]  busy and none of us can be on top of everything but would you like us to send you a packet
[34:31.840 --> 34:36.320]  of mainstream news where they just calmly admit that okay our troops I mean they had
[34:36.320 --> 34:42.280]  a rolder Rivera with a Marine Corps commander with the troops explaining why they help the
[34:42.280 --> 34:46.840]  farmers grow the opium I mean I mean they're now basically bringing this out and hiding
[34:46.840 --> 34:52.760]  it in plain view yeah well I've seen some of that but I can always look at more material
[34:52.760 --> 34:56.480]  when it's available well well here's one more issue on that subject did you see the
[34:56.480 --> 35:03.440]  Washington Post two days ago CIA units wacky idea depicts Saddam is gay and then in the
[35:03.440 --> 35:09.480]  article it quotes them as admitting that the CIA put out at least one fake Osama bin Laden
[35:09.480 --> 35:15.240]  video that sounds like that should be a congressional investigation yeah there's so many things
[35:15.240 --> 35:21.320]  that should be congressional investigations that sometimes though it becomes difficult
[35:21.320 --> 35:25.400]  if you hear of a real problem I think well I guess I ought to report this where should
[35:25.400 --> 35:30.280]  I go the FBI and the CIA and that went best to get it for me well who's going to investigate
[35:30.280 --> 35:36.800]  the investigators and that's that's our job and that's what our responsibility is to hopefully
[35:36.800 --> 35:42.760]  wake up enough people to find out who to believe and who not to believe congressman getting
[35:42.760 --> 35:49.800]  into what's happening on the economic front we read your quotes a few weeks ago about
[35:49.800 --> 35:56.000]  Bernie Sanders paraphrasing you know basically he sold out or he flip-flopped and then Grayson
[35:56.000 --> 36:00.160]  running around saying we beat the Fed what I mean you're the real expert in Congress
[36:00.160 --> 36:08.400]  recognized on this with the Fed what really happened well we got 1207 passed into the
[36:08.400 --> 36:12.520]  House reform bill and that bill passed on the House floor the big vote was in the committee
[36:12.520 --> 36:18.040]  so that's in there even though it's it's in a very bad bill when it got to the Senate
[36:18.040 --> 36:23.160]  Bernie Sanders is the one to introduce 1207 and 604 I believe in the Senate and at the
[36:23.160 --> 36:29.320]  last minute he changed his mind and took what the establishment agreed to another so severely
[36:29.320 --> 36:34.160]  watered down version of it it wasn't really an audit it was just a glimpse of what's been
[36:34.160 --> 36:39.200]  going on for the past two years which it had already agreed to but it was it passed like
[36:39.200 --> 36:47.200]  I think 96 to 0 and the administration agreed to the Obama said he'd signed it and Democratic
[36:47.200 --> 36:54.240]  and Republican leadership agreed to that and then the 1207 version was brought up by Vitter
[36:54.240 --> 37:00.760]  and when that got to the Senate floor it we only got 37 votes so I think people should
[37:00.760 --> 37:07.720]  pay attention to those who did not vote for the real audit language in the Senate and
[37:07.720 --> 37:13.000]  it and this to me is a bailout for you know the system and for the Federal Reserve but
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.480]  now they have finally passed that version in the Senate and it's going to conference so
[37:17.480 --> 37:24.760]  I'm trying to keep an eye on that very closely and see if we can influence the the conference
[37:24.760 --> 37:33.320]  and I you know I'm I just don't know whether we get that modified or what will happen but
[37:33.320 --> 37:38.280]  I think right now that the cars are stacked against us but we're going to keep fighting
[37:38.280 --> 37:44.440]  because the more attention we get and the more the people know I think we can be proud
[37:44.440 --> 37:49.000]  of how far we've gone already and how much people know about it well that's right Congressman
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.480]  25 years ago you didn't get one co-sponsor when you were first in Congress now you passed
[37:53.480 --> 37:57.560]  it in the House it went to the Senate I saw a headline where you were saying that those
[37:57.560 --> 38:02.080]  that voted against your audit the Fed bill will will be held accountable though by the
[38:02.080 --> 38:07.880]  voters oh yeah they should be and every time I mean you think of the Republicans will
[38:07.880 --> 38:13.480]  retaliate against Republicans and I mean we saw that in Utah so these votes are very important
[38:13.480 --> 38:21.800]  and you know the bailout vote was crucial in a lot of this stimulus for the Tea Party movement
[38:21.800 --> 38:27.560]  so this is just another vote that that we can use and help alert the people
[38:28.440 --> 38:32.120]  we've only got about six minutes left with Congressman Ron Paul his time is so precious
[38:32.120 --> 38:35.080]  we're going to give you some websites before he leaves so you can get involved in the campaign
[38:35.080 --> 38:42.280]  for Liberty or Rand Paul's campaign which is so important but looking at the border situation
[38:43.000 --> 38:48.200]  the deputy homeland security director said last Friday that they may not process illegals
[38:48.200 --> 38:52.680]  referred to them from Arizona I've already seen previous reports of where sheriffs and others
[38:54.120 --> 39:00.040]  release illegals for serious crimes out of jail and the feds won't pick them up I mean is this not
[39:00.040 --> 39:08.360]  serious dereliction of duty and or treason by homeland security you know so much could be
[39:08.360 --> 39:14.440]  solved with our use of our constitution and the principle of private property if you have somebody
[39:14.440 --> 39:19.880]  walking your house and they're trespassing and they might not have even committed a crime they
[39:19.880 --> 39:24.200]  might not have you know shot anybody or stolen anything yet they trespass just trespass and
[39:24.200 --> 39:29.400]  they walk in your house and they have no right to be there we call the police and the police call
[39:29.400 --> 39:35.560]  them and they prosecute them but they don't apply that to people who walk across this land and
[39:35.560 --> 39:40.200]  walk across these branches matter of fact even if you do anything to stop trespassers you can get
[39:40.200 --> 39:44.680]  into trouble you're taking the law under your own hands the states aren't allowed to do what they
[39:44.680 --> 39:51.160]  should do and when the states finally get totally frustrated you know they have to pass the law that
[39:51.160 --> 39:56.680]  then is argued about I have some reservations about that law but not about the intent and what
[39:56.680 --> 40:02.680]  they're trying to do and a dereliction of duty of the federal government I would like to see
[40:02.680 --> 40:08.520]  more approach to this that would if if you can't get them at the border and stop the influx
[40:08.520 --> 40:18.040]  then as soon as they apply you know for benefits then that's that's when we we should do I agree
[40:18.040 --> 40:22.760]  deny them the welfare benefits and that will stop but the government again wants this dependent
[40:22.760 --> 40:29.240]  group were you in the chamber when calderon lectured and and and and said repass the assault
[40:29.240 --> 40:35.000]  weapons ban effectively taking semi-automatics from american people nope I wasn't there and
[40:35.000 --> 40:41.320]  that's a personal thing with me I there's a limit to what I can actually tolerate someday so I did
[40:41.320 --> 40:47.080]  listen to it on tv and all but I didn't feel like I should be present there dummy did that
[40:47.080 --> 40:53.080]  discuss you oh yeah I mean it discussed me but I knew what he was going to say and and why do we
[40:53.080 --> 40:59.320]  give I mean buddy a couple years ago they had cars on down there I mean when cars on it is you
[40:59.320 --> 41:05.320]  know just our henchmen that we have a hard gun and they have him here down there as a head of
[41:05.320 --> 41:11.480]  a state you know talking to a joint session of congress I mean that that's more than I need well
[41:11.480 --> 41:19.800]  his his brother is admittedly even in the new york times the top opium king yeah and and yet
[41:20.360 --> 41:25.400]  in one of these days you know we'll depose him here something will happen he'll be gone and
[41:25.400 --> 41:31.400]  you know the big thing over there right now is this battle is about to start in afghanistan and
[41:32.040 --> 41:36.440]  there's no guarantees that even with all our military might that we're going to have a military
[41:36.440 --> 41:42.840]  victory there we will not have a political victory it'll be a political defeat because it'll just
[41:42.840 --> 41:47.560]  further stimulate hatred and all the other problems that you get by occupation of foreign
[41:47.560 --> 41:53.160]  countries but militarily whether whether this battle can be one is the real question well
[41:53.160 --> 41:59.640]  congressman that's part of my last two questions then we'll let you go specifically with the entire
[41:59.640 --> 42:05.960]  geopolitical situation north korea on a war footing the pentagon saying they're ready for war
[42:05.960 --> 42:12.440]  meanwhile our own government help give the reactors to north korea as you know you've got the israel
[42:12.440 --> 42:18.760]  saying they may strike iran obama saying he would you know support them if they did you've got the
[42:18.760 --> 42:25.160]  predator drones a thousand of them now going in to pakistan which many experts say is an act of
[42:25.160 --> 42:31.560]  war you've said the iran sanctions are an act of war i mean it looks like the buildup to world war
[42:31.560 --> 42:36.600]  one or world war two can you speak to the overall atmosphere and and and does the system have a
[42:36.600 --> 42:43.960]  desire to have a world crisis and then finally what do you see with the eu meltdown well you know
[42:43.960 --> 42:50.040]  it sort of blows my mind when i think about our financial crisis and uh the not only the meltdown
[42:50.040 --> 42:55.320]  of the euro uh pn nations but ours as well as well and that they hardly blink an eye that they can
[42:55.320 --> 43:02.040]  talk about uh spreading this war in the middle east into iran to continue the the civilian uh cia
[43:02.040 --> 43:08.520]  bombing of these various countries but this thing in korea it's way out of the out of proportion
[43:08.520 --> 43:15.640]  to what we should be doing i resent the fact that generation or two ago we have signed these treaties
[43:15.640 --> 43:20.280]  have been involved and have troops in korea all that time and we're just sitting there if there's
[43:20.280 --> 43:25.000]  ever a problem we get dragged into it but this week we had a resolution on the house spoiler three of
[43:25.000 --> 43:29.960]  us that voted against it and the resolution was essentially an authorization to go do whatever
[43:29.960 --> 43:35.800]  is necessary and uh and the circumstances that we live today you never come to the congress and
[43:35.800 --> 43:41.720]  make a declaration of war we have these these so-called promises but i can one generation
[43:41.720 --> 43:46.520]  promise the next generation that we will deliver all the money and all the soldiers that will be
[43:46.520 --> 43:52.120]  necessary we should just bring ourselves out of those situations but this this thing was just
[43:52.120 --> 43:58.840]  overwhelmingly passed it was billed as you know expressing our concerns and our condolences for
[43:58.840 --> 44:05.640]  the people who died there and then at the bottom it gives the authority to say and we do uh authorize
[44:05.640 --> 44:09.960]  you know whatever force and whatever is necessary to take care of this problem what's the same thing
[44:09.960 --> 44:14.840]  with the finances in europe same thing that happened here taking the pension funds raising the taxes
[44:14.840 --> 44:22.760]  vat taxes europe is now sinking into the central bank design trap in closing uh you've been talking
[44:22.760 --> 44:29.400]  about a total global meltdown for a long time based on derivatives dr paul uh and now it looks
[44:29.400 --> 44:36.280]  like we're approaching uh the vortex yeah we're we're getting awfully close and people try to
[44:36.280 --> 44:40.600]  get me to say what i think it's going to happen and i i don't know exactly what's going to happen
[44:40.600 --> 44:46.280]  i know it is unsustainable because the dollar is still being trusted and that is a subjective
[44:46.280 --> 44:52.120]  event people subjectively still say well we can trust the dollar it is the world currency
[44:52.120 --> 44:58.360]  but eventually they'll lose trust in the dollar and i think i think if you look at the um devaluation
[44:58.360 --> 45:04.760]  of the dollar against gold you realize it's something big is going on right now because up until
[45:04.760 --> 45:10.760]  a month or two ago uh the gold and the dollar always was related to the stock market and other
[45:10.760 --> 45:16.200]  currencies and commodities but right now more people are seeing the devaluation of dollar
[45:16.200 --> 45:21.880]  against gold which is the ultimate measurement and that means that uh the time is getting much
[45:21.880 --> 45:27.320]  closer to the rejection of the system i mean the europeans are broke we're bailing them out with
[45:27.320 --> 45:33.160]  dollars how about the cities they're broke are we going to let cities and states fail
[45:33.160 --> 45:38.600]  after bailing out wall street and bailing out greece there's no way they're always going to
[45:38.600 --> 45:43.480]  come to the rescue print the money and they're going to inflate until the point when the people
[45:43.480 --> 45:48.360]  are holding the dollars overseas they we're spending them the chinese are pretty smart people
[45:48.360 --> 45:53.560]  they're spending those dollars they're around buying natural resources around the world with
[45:53.560 --> 46:00.440]  dollars they earned from us at the same time we think we have to protect our natural resources
[46:00.440 --> 46:10.280]  by invading countries and occupying and protecting our oil we have lost our way and uh clearly we
[46:10.280 --> 46:15.720]  have a revolution of liberty and freedom a restoration of the republic led by yourself and
[46:15.720 --> 46:21.080]  rand paul uh give us the websites for people to get involved with your campaign with campaign
[46:21.080 --> 46:28.120]  for liberty with uh rand with everybody uh in putting out the alternative to the new world order
[46:28.120 --> 46:34.840]  all my websites can be found by ron paul dot org and i think rand is uh rand paul dot com

[46:50.520 --> 46:59.800]  had with him i just want to commend the great job my crew has been doing and i also want
[46:59.800 --> 47:05.720]  to thank all the listeners and the am and fm affiliates uh out there in fact you guys gave me
[47:05.720 --> 47:13.720]  a list yesterday in just the last week of six new affiliates and of course i uh as soon as i
[47:13.720 --> 47:22.760]  meant to go to that to plug it i don't i don't have it here maybe you can reprint that but you know
[47:27.880 --> 47:33.560]  you know we're reaching more people every day i mean this radio show it's scary how many people
[47:33.560 --> 47:45.160]  we're reaching and i don't know how to explain it i have a constant in raging frustration that i am
[47:45.160 --> 47:51.880]  not doing a good enough job breaking all this down and then i look at other people and i'm
[47:51.880 --> 47:55.000]  fighting as hard as i can i see other people out there and they could care less about what's
[47:55.000 --> 47:59.240]  happening in the world they think it's funny that some of us care what's happening and are involved
[47:59.240 --> 48:04.440]  in warning people uh you know we're on the verge of world war three right now i was watching senate
[48:04.440 --> 48:08.440]  debate yesterday and senator after senator was saying we're on the verge of a total
[48:08.440 --> 48:13.080]  world collapse and i still watch the idiot yuppies out there they're just giggling and
[48:13.080 --> 48:18.680]  laughing and running around like a bunch of fools i am genuinely freaked out folks and i'm supposed
[48:18.680 --> 48:25.320]  to be you know go back five thousand years ago and you're in some little tribe and you're out
[48:25.320 --> 48:31.160]  you know with your kids by the river and ten wolves run up you're supposed to get in a circle with
[48:31.160 --> 48:39.080]  your spears and you know tell the wolves to back off and and and we're surrounded by wolves i'm
[48:39.080 --> 48:43.880]  watching them drag whole countries down i watch the millions they've killed in the last ten years
[48:46.120 --> 48:50.760]  my god i watch them forcing vaccines on kids they know we're killing them i know they're
[48:50.760 --> 48:55.720]  poisoning the water i just they admit they're making fake bin Laden videos in the washington
[48:55.720 --> 48:59.960]  post they admit they're growing the opium and i just can't handle it anymore i'm gonna be honest
[48:59.960 --> 49:06.280]  with you it's it's sickening if i just sit here calmly like the average talk show host all puffed
[49:06.280 --> 49:12.840]  up and cover the news and talk about how i'm a patriot and just cover the issues i i've got to
[49:12.840 --> 49:22.040]  be honest with you okay just how you know i know why i'm frustrated because at a primitive level
[49:22.040 --> 49:27.080]  my brain is saying attack these people i mean that's really what it is i've really been analyzing
[49:27.080 --> 49:32.680]  myself at a primitive level my brain is saying you should be physically going up against the
[49:32.680 --> 49:37.720]  government but i'm not calling for that i know that's instinct i understand they want that this
[49:37.720 --> 49:43.880]  is a 21st century war it's an info war but i more and more i understand what my problem is
[49:43.880 --> 49:48.520]  especially lately because everything's coming down everything's been proven correct you think i get
[49:48.520 --> 49:55.240]  happy when i'm proven right you think i like this you think this is fun i see these other patriot
[49:55.240 --> 49:59.560]  groups we're enjoying themselves it's like some kind of social thing and they compete with each
[49:59.560 --> 50:05.560]  other and all this crud we're not competing with each other folks we're fighting for our lives
[50:05.560 --> 50:15.000]  against the new world order i mean just everything is verified i mean i knew they were shipping drugs
[50:15.000 --> 50:18.840]  in but to have them admit it i knew they were putting out fake bin Laden videos but to have
[50:18.840 --> 50:23.640]  them admit it i knew they're putting poison in the water but to read textbooks about how they're
[50:23.640 --> 50:28.040]  doing it to us and now they admit they're chem trailing us and the public still can't even admit
[50:28.040 --> 50:35.800]  it and it just goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on it just doesn't have to happen if
[50:35.800 --> 50:44.520]  we just wake up if men were men america's number one stories for independent talk radio for over

[52:51.560 --> 52:55.560]  know why other people aren't like me why they don't want to be informed why they don't want to be
[52:55.560 --> 53:01.480]  involved why they don't care about their kids why they don't care about anything see the sick
[53:01.480 --> 53:08.840]  thing about it is is that i've gotten more wise and i've studied a lot of history and philosophy
[53:09.800 --> 53:16.600]  and i understand now that it seemed like 10 minutes ago that i was five years old and 10
[53:16.600 --> 53:21.400]  minutes from now in the scheme of time i'm going to be 80 years old if i'm blessed to live that
[53:21.400 --> 53:26.440]  long and i'm going to be dead and more and more i could care less about myself i care about my
[53:26.440 --> 53:33.640]  fellow man black white hispanic old young whatever it is and i'm tired of people being manipulated
[53:33.640 --> 53:41.000]  and lied to and poisoned and dumbed down i have kinship with humanity i realize that that is the
[53:41.000 --> 53:48.040]  immortality the sure immortality is through the species and i really love my children i really
[53:48.040 --> 53:52.840]  want them to be free back when i was a teenager i always heard politicians say it's for the children
[53:52.840 --> 53:57.800]  think about future generations and i and i knew they were manipulating people because adults you
[53:57.800 --> 54:02.760]  care about children but now that i am a parent i really understand why they pull that string
[54:03.400 --> 54:10.600]  it's a counterfeit of we should do everything for our children and their children if you could meet
[54:10.600 --> 54:16.840]  your great great great great great grandchildren on some future space station or mars or you know
[54:16.840 --> 54:21.320]  here on the planet wouldn't you love them that little toddler that little two-year-old your
[54:21.320 --> 54:25.000]  great great great great granddaughter or son as much as you love your own children
[54:29.640 --> 54:32.520]  and we're not going to have that future they're going to set up their world government and kill
[54:32.520 --> 54:38.920]  most of us and the worst people of our species are running things and they think they're the best
[54:38.920 --> 54:46.200]  because they're so ruthless and i am just frustrated that i i'm just frustrated that

[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:36.600]  nuclear reactors and hillary put out a press release yesterday last night saying this didn't
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:41.160]  gut enough we're still gonna attack you basically i've got that here on the stack i'm sure you've
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:46.600]  seen it on the news and what's so incredible is is that you notice in the sanctions they're trying
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:53.960]  to pass in the congress it says no refined gasoline can be shipped into iran iran has lots of oil
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:57.320]  but they only have about half the refining capacity that they need for their country
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:03.640]  so our government's saying we don't want you to have gasoline and you can't have peaceful nuclear
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:12.360]  reactors to power your country and your growing population of 67 million people you cannot make
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:15.880]  a nuclear weapon with the material they want france and turkey to produce
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:25.320]  but north korea could make a bombs with what abb and donald rumsfeld gave them and they knowingly
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:33.640]  gave it to them in 96 and with a second group of reactor systems in 2000 and we've got articles
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:39.240]  up on prisonplanet.com what's the headline watson put a good article out yesterday nuclear war
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:45.880]  in korea brought to you by the us should be brought to you by the globalist but whatever
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:54.840]  yeah the u.s. didn't do it and you heard ron paul mentioned last hour you heard the congressman
[01:04:55.400 --> 01:05:03.000]  mentioned last hour here on the air that oh the cia is carrying out civilian bombings in iran
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:09.080]  in 2006 bush put out a press release from the white house reporting what cy hurch had already
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:15.320]  reported three years before that u.s. special forces and four groups of muslim terror groups
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:25.560]  three of them out of mohabia saudi arabia suni i'm not bashing sunis here i'm just talking about
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:32.440]  the groups they're using attacking shia iran and then now it's back in the news the last two days

[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:43.080]  that our government let the russians have 22 000 us troops that had been in german pow camps when
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:52.600]  the russians took them over if they will sell you out if they'll sell out the iranians if they'll
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:57.720]  sell out our own troops they'll sell you out jack so when they're taking your farm or your ranch or

[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:10.680]  you thought it was cool you thought it was an extension of your manhood to watch shock and awe
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:17.640]  as bag dad buildings blow up even if that was a just war which it wasn't you don't get off on
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:23.800]  buildings being blown up you don't get off on dead women and children it isn't tough okay and the
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:33.720]  truth is you're all hat no cattle you know it's this it's this fake john wane uh type persona
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:43.560]  and it didn't real ladies and gentlemen okay you know it's one thing to have even though it was
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:49.960]  staged the the empire of japan was corrupt and was a part of it they got suckered into attacking
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:56.120]  the u.s had forces in china attacking them they knew they were gonna attack pearl harbor they let
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:08:01.560]  them do it and then our troops went up you know iwo jima and all that and that was heroic but
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:07.000]  that's this isn't your grandpa your great grandpa's war folks that we are now the corrupt empire
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:13.320]  but but again even if you signed on to a corrupt empire you're not getting into any of the booty
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:22.280]  like say a british uh you know middle class person in in in in 1800 got to be part of the empire
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:29.000]  and actually got something out of it you're not getting jack squat out of this empire except
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:34.120]  you're paying for it and then everybody is hating you because the globalists are using the u.s to
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:39.080]  set up their world government and then at the same time blaming us for all the atrocities so
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:45.320]  they can get rid of us at the end you understand that's how this is being done all masterfully
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:51.320]  being maneuvered and set up and integrated i mean here's an example excellent article up on
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:09:00.840]  prisonplanet.com rothschild's engineer fire sale of uk infrastructure to offshore corporations
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:10.600]  and he's got all the links to the mainstream news uh talking about how the roads the businesses the
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:16.280]  infrastructure the ports all through this rothschild holding company just like they own the two big
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:21.160]  major carbon trading companies that you've got to buy your carbon credits from just made up derivative
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:29.880]  and they're financing central of uh of uh of uh spain and portugal taken over our roads here in
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:37.000]  texas 8 000 miles of them elitist banking dynasty pushes for toll roads that would privatize uk
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:43.800]  road network in rich coffers of same banking elite who have wreaked global economy who've wrecked
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:47.960]  global economy the rothschild banking family is pushing for the privatization of uk's motorway
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:52.360]  network that would force brits who have already pay a road tax to enrich the coffers of the private
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:58.840]  corporations intimately tied to the rothschilds by means of road tolls and pay by mile schemes enforced
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:04.360]  with spy cameras and then it goes on to the mainstream media reports about it but but but listen
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:12.440]  in texas which is the main funding mechanism and here's the article out of the uh tv station
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:18.520]  uh that's reporting on this out of houston and i also heard this on local news yesterday
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:27.000]  what happens is they have now put license plate reading up on existing roads that taxpayer money
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:32.200]  paid for and you drive through it don't even know it's a toll road and then you get at your address
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:36.440]  according to your driver's license database they're in your database this happened to me
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:42.760]  you get like a 200 dollar bill with in my case several hundred dollars of fines and then i tried
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:48.040]  to pay it and got more letters saying i hadn't paid it and now the fines were bigger than i had to
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:54.680]  get on the phone with the collection agency and basically it's like 40 something dollars in a in a
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:11:00.200]  couple of toll road trips turned into more than 400 now i told charlie hodge a local talk show host
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:08.040]  about this he said the same thing happened to him here it is but it gets worse it says a 15
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:17.080]  dollar fee it says a $1.25 how it begins then it's a $15 fee then it's 400 then it's a thousand
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:24.760]  then it's 1575 and they will not let you pay and it gets better they then go take your house
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:32.120]  and all roads in texas are to have this it was called the trans texas corridor they put up billboards
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:37.720]  everywhere rick perry announced it and then everybody got mad so he changed the name and they run
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:43.400]  cnn pieces attacking ron paul saying trans texas corridor doesn't exist any Texan knows it was on
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:47.640]  the news and the stink and billboards are up that's how dumb they think you are and it says right here

[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:05.240]  what's the big deal everybody's saying they blew up building seven i was there that day and sure i
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:09.720]  heard them say they they were going to blow it up but they didn't have to because it fell on its own

[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:29.640]  admittedly ripping everyone off and they just don't care anymore it's like robert rodriguez
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:33.720]  and the film commission saying they weren't getting any state funding and now erin found the video of
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:40.200]  him with the governor saying thank you for the 30 million for machete governor him with the governor
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:44.760]  and then the governor's running around lying and saying they didn't fund it i just can't
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:51.400]  they have made a conscious decision to just to just lie about everything
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:59.320]  simultaneously admitting everything this is why i'm flipping out right now

[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:51.000]  pick held around that drug lord up here shaking his finger at us and telling us to turn our guns

[01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:03.560]  under your guilt control anymore it's over respected middle east expert and former bbc
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:10.440]  presenter alan hart has broken his silence on 911 by revealing that the world's most
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:14.280]  prominent civil engineering company told him directly that the collapse of the twin towers
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:20.120]  was a controlled demolition speaking on the kevin barrett show i know kevin he's a good guy
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:23.800]  that queue it up let me play this later i'm going to push birian back this is breaking
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:29.720]  hart said he thought the 911 attack probably started as a muslim operation headed up by
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:33.880]  someone been lauding but the plot was subsequently hijacked and carried out by massade agents
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:39.560]  inclusion with elements of the cia adding that since its formation israel has penetrated every
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:45.000]  area of government and terrorist organization so he's he's going with israel did it uh it's all
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.560]  these governments involved together uh because i mean how did israel make norad stand down how
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:55.880]  did israel have cia drills and again if you got five heads on a hydra it's all part of the hydra
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:21:01.480]  it's not defending israel it's not defending england it's not defending the us it's just to
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:08.280]  say it's israel will then also make it unpalatable in the media and it's going to be spun it's it's
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:13.080]  like when i talk to the admirals involved here on air and they all said lbj was involved with
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:18.120]  us as liberty working with israel to sink it and blame it on egypt that's just what the admiral
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:23.320]  said it doesn't give israel any cover being involved in the attack that our government was
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:30.120]  involved as well it shows the collusion my guess is that at an early point they said to the bad
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:36.280]  guys in the cia hey this operation running what we do and it goes on from there so we'll get him

[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:24.840]  well this is huge breaking news paul watson does such a great job ferreting out all the info
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:33.240]  we've been to alan hart's website and he's got a lot of our material up there seems very favorable
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:38.920]  to the work we're doing uh and the real reason i want to talk to him you can debate what intelligence
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:44.760]  agency had the lead role but when you talk about us british israeli uh it it's all merged at the hip
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:51.800]  so i'm not even getting into that area you know his speculation on that and and and
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:54.680]  clearly some elements of israeli intelligence had roles
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:03.560]  the bigger i mean it's admitted abc news la times that israeli intelligence was shadowing
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:06.680]  and and and living next door to the hijackers in some cases where they're
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:12.200]  where they're landlords i mean that's a whole another subject i want to get him on record
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:19.960]  about the construction firm telling him that it was a controlled demolition that is the biggin
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:28.520]  and watson's done a great job i think you should probably add the latest information uh with the
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:33.480]  fox news pundit admitting that that day he was told they were going to blow up building seven
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:41.480]  uh and and also all that other uh information uh but kevin barrett is a great guy so we'll get him
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:45.960]  on uh as well about this very very soon i'm going to play a clip of this coming up in a moment and
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:52.680]  then david roi joe eric and others ahead of walter birian uh joining us to what an amazing story
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:58.440]  top construction firm wtc destroyed by controlled demolition and and watson you might also add
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:04.360]  it's a great article but the fireman saying there was molten metal there were bombs going off the
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:10.040]  police saying get back they're going to blow it up uh and and and also uh what that dutch engineer
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:14.360]  when he's shown building seven saying you know that's controlled demolition just so people get an
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:20.200]  idea this is just basically nuts and cherries on top of the sunday they just pile up and pile up
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:27.000]  but this guy is a prestigious reporter and correspondent uh for bbc uh you know coming
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:32.200]  out and saying that he was told this by one of the biggest controlled demolition firms uh out
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:37.720]  there uh this is certainly an incendiary report you've got up at prisonplanet.com top construction
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:44.840]  firm wtc destroyed by controlled demolition paul watson yeah well the thing to note about this
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:52.520]  guy is that he's not just a multi-decade middle eastern expert who worked for the bbc and itn
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:28:00.520]  he was actually on the inside and conducted negotiations between people like yasser arafat
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:07.720]  and uh shumail perez so his close friend i mean for example he was close friends with
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:13.960]  the shaw of iran and he tried to negotiate with the uk government to have the shaw of iran going
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:20.600]  to exile and live in his country estate yeah this guy's this guy has an incredible pedigree super
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:26.360]  high powered uh quite frankly you know he's got the markings of some type of super spy or something
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:31.640]  governments don't usually send journalists out with this level of you know uh clearance but but
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:37.880]  please continue this is a big deal yeah so basically beforehand he said he refused he
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:45.240]  refused to talk about 9 11 um didn't want to say anything about it um and then he came out with a
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:51.800]  quote where he basically said while the world's collapsing i want to look my grandchildren in
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:29:00.280]  the eye and say that i did something so now he's gone on the record and said that he had the premier
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:07.400]  world civil engineering and construction firm analyze the collapse of the twin towers and
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:13.480]  presumably building seven as well and they told him point blank that it was a controlled
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:22.280]  ground explosion a demolition he refused to name the exact firm but he said that they told him that
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:29.240]  point blank and he's got no reason to be fabricating it he's a successful author has been for years
[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:41.320]  and now he's broke his silence on 9 11 and also he goes a little bit into speculation about what
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:50.840]  he thought happened um he said that the plot was probably started by al qaeda however you want to
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:59.320]  define that and uh because obviously israel since its formation has infiltrated and controlled
[01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:05.880]  arab governments and arab militant groups that they immediately got wind of the plot went to the
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:12.360]  went to the cia and asked them you know what we're going to do about this and basically the the zionist
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:19.080]  and the neocons said let's use it which is exactly what they pronounced in their own project for a
[01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:24.760]  numeric and sentry document the year before they called for a catastrophic and catalyzing event
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:32.600]  a new pearl harbor and that's exactly what they got with 9 11 so he points to the fact that there
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:39.960]  were five dancing israelis who were originally called middle easterners it later was confirmed
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:47.640]  by the jewish newspaper forward that they were Mossad agents so of course that proves that
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:54.920]  israel knew the attack was going to happen but heart went further and said that he believes
[01:30:54.920 --> 01:31:01.240]  that the planes had been fitted with transponders and the attack was conducted by remote control
[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:08.840]  control which is what we lean towards because of course top pilots across the board have said that
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:17.880]  you cannot fly a massive commercial airliner at 600 miles an hour at sea level a without the
[01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:24.040]  airliner if it's a standard you know Boeing commercial airliner without it breaking up
[01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:30.600]  because the air pressure at sea level is so intense and he's going at 600 miles an hour
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:39.320]  the flight that went into the south tower and be these so-called hijackers alleged hijackers
[01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:45.160]  struggled to even fly basic cessna lie aircraft so the fact that they were able to pull off
[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:52.200]  flight maneuvers that would have been outside the skill of you know top guns as many pilots have said
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:32:01.080]  um strongly indicates that it was a remote controlled attack well for me the big issue is
[01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:06.600]  does he say and is this i haven't even a chance to read your entire article because they came in
[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:10.280]  and gave this to me and i'm scanning over and we got you on because you're constantly working
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:15.480]  this just went up on prisonplanet.com it'll be up on info wars.com within minutes i mean does he
[01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:20.120]  say what because this is a prestigious reporter he's got a very good record does he say what
[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:24.200]  what demolition company i mean the biggest is controlled demolition incorporated or they're
[01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:28.120]  one of the biggest and they were the ones who helped you know drag all the wreckage away
[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:32.120]  not just the world trade center wreckage complex but also Oklahoma city so clearly
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:37.160]  involved in the cover up i would imagine it's not them uh so i mean i mean does he say what company
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:44.680]  now he says he's got close friends and consultants who work for the world
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:50.680]  leading civil engineering and construction but he point blank refused to name it but he said
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:54.200]  it was well i mean that could be general electric too i mean when you get up to just
[01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:59.720]  overall the biggest building projects general electric yeah he refused to name it but he said
[01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:05.320]  it was the biggest and that his close friends worked for it and he commissioned them to look at
[01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:10.280]  the videos and the evidence and they said it was a controlled demolition probably general electric
[01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:14.920]  because he because if he says construction not just demolition you know that would be but there's
[01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:20.440]  some other big ones but i believe guys google biggest construction company in the world i know
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:25.880]  they've been logging grapes like number six or something but uh i believe it's uh uh general
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:30.040]  electric though they've been divesting some of that they build most of the big mega dams and
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:36.760]  other things like that but uh i also built a lot of the weapons of smart bombs well i'll tell you
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:40.520]  this is i mean we've got the former german defense minister the former head of german intelligence
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:45.640]  the number two currently in the japanese government uh we've got uh all these other world leaders
[01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:52.040]  coming out uh saying it's an inside job uh and uh you know we know the government did call the
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:57.480]  tonkin the government was involved in the us's liberty i mean i've had all the admirals on
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:03.000]  geist all of them most of them are dead more i had on a bunch the former chairman joined
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:07.400]  jesus staff they all said the same thing israel tried to sink that ship to blame it on egypt
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:12.040]  to start world war three with the russians as basically part of operation northwoods 1967
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:18.600]  and that when they launched their jets to go defend the ship lbj got on the radio over the
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:23.880]  phone and said that gd ships going to the bottom and that and that he'd been in control of the ship
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:29.720]  under a national security operation ignoramuses out there go presidents aren't over ships yeah
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:35.000]  they're over spy ships in national security uh just like they're over delta force uh and it's on
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:41.640]  record that he was in control of that spy ship and and and it was under mac namara's orders
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:45.720]  and a specific black ops just like jimmy carter was over the delta force
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:53.160]  and the 79 failed operation uh into uh iran that was a setup i've talked to delta force people
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:59.880]  that were involved they were set up to fail on that uh it says vincey is the world's leading commission
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:04.280]  and construction group where everybody says they're the biggest i'd like to look at a separate study
[01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:09.400]  on that whatever who knows who the biggest construction company is i want to get him on
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:14.600]  and i want to get buried on as soon as possible we're still going to have walter beryon on i was
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:17.720]  going to have a month for two hours and a month for an hour and 40 minutes but i want to go to
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:23.560]  your calls as promised get into some other news watson can you believe they're now putting up they
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:28.040]  tell you on the news by the transponder and and you're covered by all the toll roads there on
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:32.600]  existing roads but now they're using license plate readers and not even telling you you're on a toll
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:42.360]  road and then giving you 1000 let me read the houston tv station article 1575 dollar fines
[01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:47.960]  on an original one dollar 25 toll and then now that they're announcing all of your roads in england
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:51.960]  will be paid by the mile and there'll be no judge no jury they're just going to send you magical
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:56.600]  bills i mean i mean they're paul they're admitting bin laden fake videos they're admitting the
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:36:02.600]  government grows the opium uh they're coming out in plain view and going okay yeah so what we
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:07.960]  were going to blow up building seven but i mean they're just admitting everything yeah with the
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:12.760]  with the road road toll thing they're saying that there's going to be massive public resistance
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:17.080]  which might stop them from getting it through but as i point out in the article
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:24.760]  british people already pay road tax they also pay council tax which goes towards the road maintenance
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:29.560]  so they're already taxed twice for the roads and now they're going to make us pay tolls as well
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:39.560]  and the rough child are the ones pushing it so i mean yeah they're going for broke but
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:45.400]  on the same token they're saying that you know we're going to go for this but we're not sure
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:50.920]  whether we'll be able to ram it all through because the public resistance is growing and
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:55.320]  uh there's going to be a backlash but it just remains but if you don't like toll roads you're
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:37:01.480]  racist yeah that'll be the next thing i guess no no they're already attacking rand paul republican
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:07.160]  websites going he's a delusional fruit he believes there's something called spp he believes there was
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:14.280]  a north american highway public u.s government maps statements meetings 83 of the major highways
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:21.240]  turned into international toll roads to fund the n a u they separately picked at lana or miami as the
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:26.440]  capital it's all public and they just get up on the news paul and say it doesn't exist and we're
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:34.360]  completely insane yeah and now it's come out that um the rachel madow interview with rand paul um
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:40.680]  nimo was just in the night called mr. info was they um put out a fake transcript after the
[01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:46.360]  interview to me and paul was a racist oh god there's no end what was he never even said on the show
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:55.160]  and he's uh yeah and uh i mean it's overload point here watson and and that's what they're
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:38:00.840]  doing psychologically is they're trying to break our will where okay we make fake bin laden videos
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:04.840]  we grow the drugs we're poisoning your water we're putting cancer shots in your vaccines
[01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:13.720]  yeah the Gardasil's killing kids we're gonna make you take it by the way uh the going back to the
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:21.240]  first big story uh general electric is the biggest overall group but they subcontract
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:27.720]  and normally it's with bechtel and it says it's the number one construction company in the us
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:31.400]  vincy is the number one in france uh
[01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:44.760]  uh horchiff in uh germany ccc ltd acs in spain so it goes on i need to know who the biggest
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:49.080]  in the world is uh you watch it's gonna be because i've seen that over and over again
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:53.800]  that they build almost all the big dams and well who knows i shouldn't sit here and obsess over
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:58.840]  factoids anymore but but watson the reason i figured out i'm even more upset now than ever been
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:03.960]  and i'm talking to everybody else who's in tune and intelligent informed you can feel the quickening
[01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:09.000]  as ron paul said it's all starting to come to a head and you talk about this bbc reporter
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  top construction firm wtc destroyed by controlled demolition you know you talk about that that's
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:20.120]  why you're he's saying he went public according to the quotes you have in the article is is that
[01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:25.400]  is that he sees the whole world going down in flames why not just tell it all and it's that
[01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:31.640]  spirit that may save us if we just stop caring what our neighbor thinks our neighbor only follows
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:38.200]  who they think is the winner or where they think the wind's blowing we've got to stand up as leaders
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:41.800]  and it doesn't mean you have all the answers it doesn't mean you're the best spoken person
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:47.400]  talking about myself it doesn't mean you know i love that full metal jacket quote you know private
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:52.760]  joker is silly and ignorant but he's got guts and guts is enough folks you just got to know
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:59.480]  things are wrong and you got to stand up and say folks wake up look around you things are not in
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:06.120]  good shape right now i mean when they come out and start sending people $1,500 fines without a
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:15.000]  judge or jury on an unpaid $1.25 cent ticket and i know the law that's illegal i mean state of
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.880]  texas last year ruled that the red light cameras are illegal just like california did and the company
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:26.520]  says i don't care we're doing it i mean they're just a pack of scum Watson well it's the predatory
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:32.360]  system and i mean they need to they won't just let us live our lives you know before people
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:37.480]  thought well if i just stay keep my nose out of their business then i'm not political i'll be able
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:42.520]  to live my life but they're not gonna allow you to do that because it's a predatory system that
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:52.040]  depends on feeding upon the public for its own sustenance i'll tell you paul there is now 100
[01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:57.000]  percent confirmed they are going for broke and when we say that all the time but it every moment
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:03.080]  it dawns on me more just how dire our straits are and people should be a lot more awake okay sure
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:07.640]  every income it's being thrown out that isn't enough we need bankers indicted we need the
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:13.720]  fellow reserve gone we need let's see the globalists know as ron paul said we're gaining ground
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:18.280]  they can look into the future and tell we're gonna win that's why they're trying to head us off at the
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:26.600]  past exactly and they're planning false flags with which to do that which is also what heart
[01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:33.720]  talks about he says that israel is basically planning another false flag um based around the
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:39.880]  stolen nukes from minnow air force base and that it's going to be used as a pretext going to iran
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:46.440]  so and he he was on the inside that's not an opinion to be taken lightly this is somebody who
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:56.280]  was deeply on the inside in the middle east well i mean the fact that they're so bold to
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:01.080]  blow up those towers in front of everybody and then even said they were going to blow up seven
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:06.280]  and then blow it up and say we never said that when there's scores of radio and tv newscast as
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:10.920]  they did it and they had the bbc false script they blew it up and then we are changed went and
[01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:18.920]  interviewed that reporter the bbc world news anchor and he said oh i was taking my son to
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:23.080]  see a movie that day i wasn't working on 9 11 and they said yes sir here's the transcript you were
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:28.440]  on tv and he goes he goes oh i guess you're right i was there you can tell that guy's an operative
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:35.240]  and he suddenly says i guess you're informed i'll have to speak to you as a human it was the same
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:38.920]  thing with gary heart remember gary heart when they go we have you know you said that our government
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:43.720]  will stage terror attacks to invade iran you threaten knock men energy into public letter
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:47.560]  and hearts said i did no such thing and they said here is the letter and they read and he goes
[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:52.920]  oh yes i did and suddenly he changed sort of sweating he went he knew he had actual humans
[01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:57.880]  on his hands he was like whoa because they're so used to talking to zombies stay there stay there
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:04.120]  can phone and your calls hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing

[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:13.880]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:18.520]  even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our
[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:24.200]  friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a

[01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:51.240]  controlled demolition that i'm going to take your calls and coming up it is confirmed rachel madow
[01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:56.680]  needs to be sued rand paul i should have told ron paul about this i didn't know about it yet
[01:52:57.480 --> 01:53:01.640]  but i noticed she was misquoting him things he hadn't said and he kept saying i didn't say that and
[01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:07.400]  the proof was that he hadn't so i'd noticed that and noticed that they never ever ever had a video
[01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:11.960]  clip they just said he said it and they would have been running it and my mother says she goes over
[01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:16.120]  the tv when she's cooking dinner breakfast and just turns on the tv and no matter what channel
[01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:23.640]  it's attacking rand paul i mean this is another government hoax and uh you know he need they need
[01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:29.560]  to sue msnbc and i'm not into suing people for money or for fun but you know if somebody gets
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:33.320]  up on the air and says i'm a drug dealer when i don't even use drugs by the way i don't even
[01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:36.600]  drink or smoke anymore i'm always going on and off of alcohol and cigarettes but i've really
[01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:40.920]  been doing good i went four years once without drinking and smoking i'm going to go forever now
[01:53:40.920 --> 01:53:45.880]  but you know the point is you know somebody lies about me and says i'm a drug dealer i sue them
[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:51.720]  somebody uh starts stalking my sister and saying killer i sue them
[01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:57.400]  i mean i'm very close to suing the southern prairie law center in adl but i mean everything's
[01:53:57.400 --> 01:54:02.680]  going to hell in a handbasket and they're also discredited i haven't but rand paul needs to go
[01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:08.840]  ahead and sue madow over this transcript because that is the definition of slander and a public
[01:54:08.840 --> 01:54:13.400]  figure can win slander libel defamation whatever the case is this is this is uh
[01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:21.080]  this is slander and libel because they printed it in overall defamation malice of forethought
[01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:28.040]  with the attempt to do harm i mean you look you must sue this is a message around paul it's confirmed
[01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:35.560]  you must sue msnbc for the retraction the only thing they'll pay attention to is a big mean fat
[01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:43.320]  suit against against that corporate prostitute system against those bomb making baby killing
[01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:49.880]  general electric owned mbc and well i can prove all what i just said and you need to drag them
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:56.360]  into court and make it a big deal that you're suing them about their big fat lies corporate media
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:55:02.120]  uses fraudulent msnbc transcript to portray rand paul as a racist in order to smear his credit
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:07.400]  ran paul and prevent him from going to the senate msnbc is modified a transcript there was a parents
[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:11.960]  in the racial madow show which was then used nationwide paul appeared on the show after he
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:17.240]  won the primary in kentucky the modified transcript reads as follows madow do you think
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:22.440]  that a private business has a right to say we don't serve black people yes i'm not in favor of any
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:31.000]  discrimination of any form as before its news notes paul's yes was some sort of insignificant
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:36.360]  vocalization to maintain the flow of conversation this was already made difficult by the satellite
[01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:42.920]  delay here is a youtube video the exchange queued up to the exact moment following the entire video
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:47.320]  show so they knowingly then went out and said that he was for not serving black people
[01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:51.480]  when they know that he went yes excuse me say that i can't hear you and then want to say no
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:58.680]  i'm against discrimination paul watson comments on this yeah well i did a segment with bernard
[01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:05.240]  on this last week and this was a contrived mirror type because as soon as rand paul won
[01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:11.960]  the media in unison tried to attack him as a racist elitist because he used a country club
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:19.080]  at which the stage is victory celebration so they were already you know waiting with baited
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:23.880]  breath country clubs are everywhere now i mean i mean they got country clubs you can join
[01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:29.080]  you know for twenty dollars a visit i mean like it's who a country club who i mean what do you
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:35.480]  think there is in kentucky i mean i mean what do you do yeah and that that didn't work so they
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:41.720]  immediately went after him on this uh new ones philosophical position on civil rights which of
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:48.120]  course they used to call him a racist and imply that he was a clan member yeah well matt allen them
[01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:55.640]  are are are are are claiming he said that he supports shutting down uh black people's rights
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:59.960]  to eat at lunch counters when they know he didn't god bless you paul your call straight ahead and
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:04.920]  welter bernard question is where should the american people draw their line in the sand
[01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:10.840]  what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a constitution which
[01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:15.960]  protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for
[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:21.320]  dinner so they think they own our land they think they're on our water children our education our

[02:00:36.120 --> 02:00:45.000]  total slavery apple now makes them sign a contract that they won't commit suicide and if they even
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:52.920]  or show any mental illness so if you argue you're taken to a mental institution so this is psychological
[02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:57.800]  tyranny and total slavery and it's actually got the quotes in the fox news article so i briefly
[02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:03.800]  wanted to bring rob Jacobson up on the phone system to break down his views on it because he
[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:08.040]  said it so well during that short break then i'm going to cover the economy briefly then to your
[02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:14.040]  phone calls then walter birian go ahead oh hi alex i got this article right here uh
[02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:20.680]  apple maker foxconn steps up anti suicide drive the very first line in the article says apple
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:27.640]  manufacturer foxconn wednesday urged workers to sign contracts promising not to kill themselves
[02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:35.640]  for a stem uh to stem a spat of suicides um later on in the article near the end of this one article
[02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:42.360]  some guy uh who works at the plant actually was quoted as saying if i bicker with my supervisor
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:47.560]  i'll be sent to a mental hospital and then the plant themselves follow up by saying uh this guy uh
[02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:53.400]  there is no shortage of people trying to get through the session gates the company says around
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:59.400]  eight thousand people apply to work at the factory every day so here you have three hundred thousand
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:05.800]  people working in this foxconn factory in china which they admit they have uh people from all
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:11.320]  over remote areas of china applying for jobs they immediately the moment they get a job there they
[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:16.760]  have to waive their rights away meaning that they know that they are going to be over-houred
[02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:21.080]  underpaid and all this stuff so that the chinese regulations don't apply to them and now that all
[02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:25.560]  these people have been worked at that they're committing suicide they're using that as an excuse
[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:32.760]  to have them sign even more kind of draconian um uh waiving their rights against them which
[02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:37.480]  means that if they bicker with their supervisor there's no argument there's no and this is the
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:43.480]  essence of the new world order create inhuman conditions then when you rebel they clamp in
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:49.240]  with even more dehumanization then there'll be more suicides then everyone will have to be drug
[02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:57.240]  and remember all of the apple ipad and iphone knockoffs are costing on average half of what
[02:02:57.240 --> 02:03:03.720]  the apple does the apple i've read the ipad may have sixty dollars in it an iphone may have
[02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:10.600]  twenty dollars in it giant huge profits for al gore on their board for steve jobs but because
[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:17.000]  they say they're liberal and for carbon taxes the left loves it the most abuse of factories
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:25.400]  the most evil and it's just totally absolutely sickening and this is how it works and so i've
[02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:31.480]  got to come out against the iphone and the ipad uh you know they're nice products uh i mean this
[02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:37.640]  makes a nike look like angels and and this is a perfect example and america will soon be like
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:43.400]  this we're being destroyed by globalization china is the lowest of the low they are the great sucking
[02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:48.040]  sound that's where everything is sucked down the globalist toilet ends up with these poor human
[02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:53.720]  beings i mean have you seen the microsoft photos of of everybody asleep you know sleeping during
[02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:58.760]  their break in their 20 hour work days inside that facility that photo that came out a few weeks ago
[02:03:59.320 --> 02:04:03.720]  yeah i see it in fact there's an article sitting right outside uh your studio where there are
[02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:09.080]  photographs of these people standing there for eight hours a day some of them have to drop things
[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:14.200]  just to give their legs a rest um some of them complain about they they don't even feel like
[02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:19.640]  they're human anymore it's obviously this top corporate you know scheme to get these people to
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:25.640]  work like robots by the way they work a lot more than eight hours china routinely they work 18 hours
[02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:31.080]  in some cases i mean they have firework factories were part of public school the kids have to work
[02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:39.320]  three days a week uh look at this foxcom opens plant reporters that were suicides another foxcom
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:47.960]  employee dies in china media ninth worker death in iphone factory that's in taiwan and it just shows
[02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:54.280]  these people plus it's the chemicals i mean when i drilled that that that that ipad all that you
[02:04:54.280 --> 02:05:00.120]  were here you saw that weird poison smoke that came out and in fact i understand that there is an
[02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:05.560]  article i mean apple has been caught a lot of times uh with these weird cancers coming out of
[02:05:05.560 --> 02:05:10.520]  their factories years ago they know about all these weird chemicals they put in these places
[02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:17.720]  in these machines these weird uh you know combination of chemicals and who knows what's
[02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:23.240]  going on in this factory with this combination i mean 300 000 workers there's got to be a lot of
[02:05:23.240 --> 02:05:29.560]  different chemistry going on that these people are inhaling and um if you even complain about it to
[02:05:29.560 --> 02:05:33.560]  your supervisor if you're uncomfortable if you can't stand anymore well the new thing is going to
[02:05:33.560 --> 02:05:38.920]  be that you'll be just dragged away to a mental hospital and according to the factory they don't
[02:05:38.920 --> 02:05:44.440]  really care because 8 000 people apply for work there every single day which means it's only a
[02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:48.840]  matter of time where the people who don't want to sign that they will be sifted out and they'll
[02:05:48.840 --> 02:05:54.520]  have a full population of people there who have signed this new statement and then if you're uncomfortable
[02:05:54.520 --> 02:06:01.080]  if you can't stand anymore if you're inhaling bad chemicals if you're no matter what the issue is
[02:06:01.080 --> 02:06:06.120]  they'll just drag you away and replace you with a new one truly treating you like and this is
[02:06:06.120 --> 02:06:10.120]  globalization they don't want middle classes that have their own truly sustainable communities
[02:06:10.920 --> 02:06:15.720]  they don't want people that are independent and free and healthy they love debasing everything
[02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:21.480]  to the lowest level so everyone is bankrupt so everyone can come to them and get the lowest
[02:06:21.480 --> 02:06:26.760]  wage look what open borders and NAFTA and GATT have done to Mexico they on according to every
[02:06:26.760 --> 02:06:32.520]  research paper out there Mexico is far worse than they were 17 years ago with the adoption
[02:06:33.160 --> 02:06:40.040]  of NAFTA and GATT it hurts us it hurts them it hurts the Chinese and this is our destruction
[02:06:40.040 --> 02:06:45.880]  and and nothing but pure evil coming out of all these widgets and you know what we think is cheap
[02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:50.920]  and then buying the cheap goods destroys our industry and it just gets worse and worse and
[02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:55.960]  then we have more environmental standards which no one can you know put up with so everything goes
[02:06:55.960 --> 02:07:01.320]  to China where there's no standards and that's why they've been chosen as the model of the new
[02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:08.200]  world government where it's literally a system devouring humanity Paul Watson was on with this
[02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:14.520]  earlier with a key article top construction firm WTC destroyed by control demolition we have another
[02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:21.000]  big report up corporate media by Kurt Nemo uses fraudulent MSNBC transcript to portray Rand Paul
[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:25.560]  as a racist I think this is libelous that they know it's not what he said and they're going with it
[02:07:25.560 --> 02:07:31.880]  slanderous defamation and joining us talk about the situation with the iphone's ipads in China and
[02:07:31.880 --> 02:07:37.560]  Taiwan is Rob Jacobson with the info wars team rob thanks for coming on with us no problem out
[02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:42.520]  oh man it is just so much going on but we're covering a lot of info okay your call's coming
[02:07:42.520 --> 02:07:47.800]  up in a moment but I briefly wanted to bring Ted Anderson up gold's up over $20 in the last day
[02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:53.160]  the globalists have tried to drive it down but the domino implosion of banks and economies
[02:07:53.160 --> 02:07:58.920]  worldwide is accelerating led by the europe of the euro situation and so I wanted to bring Ted
[02:07:58.920 --> 02:08:04.040]  Anderson up to tell you about the gold and silver offers he's got today for people out there that
[02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:08.920]  want to start moving out of paper to protect themselves with gold at all time highs worldwide
[02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:13.240]  right Ted Anderson good to have you on with us yeah nice to be up again Alex of course we've
[02:08:13.240 --> 02:08:19.320]  seen the grease fall apart here in the imf bailout now it's happening in now it's happening in
[02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:24.040]  Spain and we all know the united kingdom is having trouble I mean it's just europe is just
[02:08:24.040 --> 02:08:29.560]  melting apart it's melting apart so bad that people are racing to anything that has anything
[02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:36.680]  that appearance of security for it US government treasury bills are up the united states dollars
[02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:42.360]  going up which is crazy because we're killing it here and and gold is just up late you know
[02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:50.040]  had up today to a total of 1200 and 1780 so we broke through that $1,200 an ounce price again
[02:08:50.040 --> 02:08:56.360]  just real fast really best thing Alex the what I really want people to do is I want them to take
[02:08:56.360 --> 02:09:03.480]  advantage of this frank offer where I have it priced at 256 68 it's a fifth of an ounce of gold
[02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:10.040]  I give a full year subscription to Bob Chapman's newsletter which is $159 so you can get informed
[02:09:10.040 --> 02:09:14.200]  and you know what's going on in the marketplace and Ted I don't want to attack your competition
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:21.160]  or one of the biggest names in the country associated with Glenn Beck has been attacked lately
[02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:26.840]  because they're selling and I saw the New York Times use the example of a fifth of an ounce frank
[02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:34.600]  at $364 you're selling it for 250 something which is below what it should be I mean it's a good
[02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:38.680]  deal to get it for 300 I'm not even saying it's that bad of a deal you know with Beck I mean
[02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:44.440]  people expect to have no markup you're giving it for 200 to something in fact I meant to pull
[02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:50.680]  that up and and and there is this national investigation of another big national company
[02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:59.240]  for 350 360 dollar uh Frank's and and that happened a year ago when gold was a lot lower
[02:09:59.240 --> 02:10:04.360]  they were selling it for that gold's way up and you're selling it for cheaper than anybody else
[02:10:04.360 --> 02:10:09.000]  I've ever seen Ted well I I've got the price low I mean main thing is is that people get a lot of
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:13.800]  gold in their hands I mean if you're sitting in the stock market the bond market if you're looking
[02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:18.760]  at you know even if you're in t-bills at this point in time you can just see what the Federal
[02:10:18.760 --> 02:10:24.040]  Reserve is doing I mean we bailed out Greece we're we're on the hook for about 16 percent of that
[02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:30.040]  bailout and you know where's the money coming from the US Treasury doesn't have extra money
[02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:34.360]  is coming from the Fed in a printing press and we saw what happened last month or just three
[02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:40.600]  weeks ago Euro goes down first then the dollar within a week because people flee like a seesaw
[02:10:40.600 --> 02:10:44.440]  you know the ship's sinking so they run to one end of the boat it starts sinking they run back
[02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:49.400]  to the other end of the boat the issue is there's a hole in the bottom and no amount of catwalking
[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:53.640]  is going to fix it no amount of balancing act is going to fix it no amount of gymnastics is going
[02:10:53.640 --> 02:10:57.880]  to fix it until we get rid of the bankers the central bankers Ted quickly there's a bunch of
[02:10:57.880 --> 02:11:05.320]  other coins you've got give folks the toll free number to call and get them yeah 1-800-686-2237
[02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:13.080]  again 1-800-686-2237 and Alex I really want people to take advantage of this fraying thing
[02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:17.720]  I mean I lose a hundred bucks a coin because I'm giving away the the international forecaster
[02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:22.040]  newsletter with it but people will be informed and I think they can make much better decisions
[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:27.880]  if they get that absolutely now again how much is the frank individually as a lot of people
[02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:31.320]  have already got the forecaster that's a great deal but if they want to buy them at that price
[02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:37.720]  individually how much did you say it's 256 68 it's just a fabulous buy yeah because you bought
[02:11:37.720 --> 02:11:41.640]  a bunch of it when gold was lower you're selling it now when it's higher at a lower price and you
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:46.600]  and the and your competition selling it for 360 bucks according to the news I mean which
[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:51.720]  isn't even that bad of a deal I mean these companies have overhead but Ted is the best folks with
[02:11:51.720 --> 02:11:58.920]  these specials you cannot do better if you're getting into golden silver 800-686-2237 thank you

[02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:57.000]  have been really patient and i apologize we had breaking news earlier with the 911 foe
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:03.080]  let's talk to david in ohio you're on the air david oh yeah i like the story about the ipad
[02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:07.160]  but you you bought a few ipads why'd you do that is that kind of support in the new world
[02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:11.800]  absolutely i mean i'm that's the whole point i make is we all contribute to this new world order
[02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:17.000]  system and i pointed out in the video i made where i tortured the ipad that that people are
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:21.720]  being used as slaves to build these and most other products uh and then meanwhile we don't
[02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:27.640]  care about the fellow humans but people will get set about the ipad uh so i think i flagellate myself
[02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:32.920]  you know enough here beating myself on air but i will say it i am bad i'm a hypocrite i am scum
[02:17:32.920 --> 02:17:38.360]  how's that david i just want to point that out but i also want to point out with ran paul i mean
[02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:44.120]  you guys say he they mess with the transcript but he is for repealing parts of the civil rights bill
[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:47.960]  and you know i mean you're in favor of that i don't understand that i mean that that'll put
[02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:51.640]  us back into a system where black people won't be served in restaurant oh yeah that's really
[02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:56.200]  gonna happen yeah i know ran paul he's really dangerous we all better run for the hills uh
[02:17:56.200 --> 02:18:00.920]  they lied about what he said and he said that he's against people not being able to be in private
[02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:06.760]  clubs uh and that's not even one of his campaign issues and let me ask you a question though david
[02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:13.160]  uh david do you have uh what type of telephone you call me on right now i'm on a cell right now
[02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:18.120]  yeah and i've been and i'm you know the point is all these companies are doing this apple claims
[02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:24.360]  it's all liberal and loving and so uh i've always pointed out the hypocrisy of how our own society
[02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:29.720]  buying this is destroying us and i point out how i'm not adequate and i'm not good i think it's a
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:36.600]  disgusting pathetic argument to call into this show and to imply that i'm some type of bad person
[02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:42.520]  i mean am i taking your rights uh david no but like an hour ago you said the government's gang
[02:18:42.520 --> 02:18:46.200]  raping us now i mean you got a tone down your rhetoric alex for real you've been saying it for
[02:18:46.200 --> 02:18:50.760]  years that the government wants no the government is gang raping us the government is eating out
[02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:55.400]  our substance like a declaration of independence so so david let me guess you've got a government job
[02:18:56.600 --> 02:18:59.960]  no i don't i just want to ask you don't you realize that there's a segment of your listening

[02:19:20.440 --> 02:19:26.120]  israel giving nukes uh to south africa could cause world war three and they have them by the way
[02:19:26.120 --> 02:19:31.960]  and and and they gave them bio weapons research in exchange that's now on record uh the government
[02:19:31.960 --> 02:19:37.560]  raping and robbing and stealing our wealth and our money is what's causing people to be deranged

[02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:48.680]  been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives and vaccines might impair the
[02:26:48.680 --> 02:26:53.400]  neurological development of children these new studies suggest that the offices that the
[02:26:53.400 --> 02:27:00.600]  preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance okay so
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:05.240]  you know what maybe you do have a study saying fluoride's good maybe you got a study saying

[02:32:10.520 --> 02:32:16.600]  civilization is burning off our home it's peeling away and showing what we really are the dynamic
[02:32:16.600 --> 02:32:23.240]  genius creatures that will not be dominated by anybody do you understand that i know you don't
[02:32:23.240 --> 02:32:29.400]  like it because our cowards the truth is scum and weak filth always joins together to pull down the

[02:32:39.960 --> 02:32:45.640]  all right all right now i'm gonna shut up i'm gonna stop now
[02:32:45.640 --> 02:32:53.160]  Walter Buren is an advocate of government financial accountability and budgeting
[02:32:54.680 --> 02:32:59.880]  names elicited us military goes through that forwarded nuclear power school
[02:33:01.320 --> 02:33:03.640]  he put an early discharge the navy
[02:33:04.600 --> 02:33:11.000]  united states naval academy worked at xerox core princeton and he was a big trader
[02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:15.640]  here on the stock exchange and a bunch of key work that let him discover
[02:33:16.200 --> 02:33:19.560]  there's some amazing stuff that was going on it's just best for him because of the
[02:33:19.560 --> 02:33:23.240]  and walter where we've got like 30 new affiliates since you were last on or more
[02:33:23.240 --> 02:33:28.920]  so just just talk to me like i'm a six-year-old uh that's the best way i learn everybody else
[02:33:28.920 --> 02:33:33.560]  learns but when you first covered this 14 years ago it's all been vetted out now now it's a
[02:33:33.560 --> 02:33:36.680]  mainstream term people know about the double set of books just like they now know about the
[02:33:36.680 --> 02:33:40.280]  fellow reserve they don't know as much about this as they do about the fed but it all ties
[02:33:40.280 --> 02:33:44.520]  together so you got the floor to describe what the comprehensive annual financial reports are
[02:33:44.520 --> 02:33:48.520]  what the double set of books are what the private corporate takeover through government is
[02:33:50.440 --> 02:33:54.840]  and it's good to have you back with us uh walter beryon uh good to be back uh
[02:33:54.840 --> 02:34:01.720]  alex i just had one comment uh for date your previous caller yes and that one comment is
[02:34:02.280 --> 02:34:05.080]  predators do not like armed prey
[02:34:05.080 --> 02:34:11.240]  the uh about over 10 years ago i did a little statistical survey i was a commodity trading
[02:34:11.240 --> 02:34:16.920]  advisor and i'm quite smart with graphs and charts and so forth and i looked at each state
[02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:25.240]  for the highest and strongest taxation and money taken from the populace state by state
[02:34:25.240 --> 02:34:33.400]  and i did a comparison with the least uh restraint into gun ownership laws well when you compare
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:39.800]  the charts side by side the states that are taking or stealing the most amount of money from the
[02:34:39.800 --> 02:34:46.600]  population has the most stringent gun control laws the states that were taking the least
[02:34:46.600 --> 02:34:53.480]  amounts of money from the population have the least restrictive gun laws and i go back to what i
[02:34:53.480 --> 02:34:59.800]  said before predators do not like armed prey oh look at daily that big fat admitted mob boss
[02:34:59.800 --> 02:35:05.800]  wanting everyone's guns period they're a bunch of predatory scum and oh they make me sick we're
[02:35:05.800 --> 02:35:09.720]  supposed to not like people that want us to be their slaves as you know walter and you've been
[02:35:09.720 --> 02:35:14.120]  through hell through government persecution with them taking your son everything else but you're
[02:35:14.120 --> 02:35:18.280]  supposed to love it you're supposed to thank the government you're supposed to worship them and
[02:35:18.280 --> 02:35:23.320]  appreciate all the evil they give you you're supposed to say thank you sir can i have another
[02:35:23.320 --> 02:35:28.600]  please rub it in now when you say government also keep in mind people have this false illusion
[02:35:28.600 --> 02:35:34.840]  they say government and it's a draw a blind government is made up of individuals uh with
[02:35:34.840 --> 02:35:40.840]  names addresses that are running the show now at the top of echelon the congressman the senators
[02:35:40.840 --> 02:35:47.240]  the governors 70 percent now are attorneys everyone knows the reputation of an attorney
[02:35:47.800 --> 02:35:51.080]  uh you got to use me or else you'll be destroyed and then once you use them we're going to take
[02:35:51.080 --> 02:35:55.240]  as much money as we think we can get from you and then once they screw you they say get the
[02:35:55.240 --> 02:36:00.120]  act all and take it and if you don't say thank you and we now have 70 percent attorneys running the
[02:36:00.120 --> 02:36:06.920]  entire show uh walking with as much cash as they can take now and dotting the eyes and crossing
[02:36:06.920 --> 02:36:12.200]  the keys to lock in the productivity value the next five to seven generations now let's get a
[02:36:12.200 --> 02:36:19.160]  clue is there a problem here yes and uh it needs to be corrected well in every case in history
[02:36:19.160 --> 02:36:23.800]  elite groups get together and try to get control of the population and then make them slaves
[02:36:23.800 --> 02:36:28.920]  that's 101 but but uh you you said during the break you wanted to talk briefly about the new
[02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:34.280]  9-11 info that's come out then let's get into the you know the bio if you looked uh the i was
[02:36:34.280 --> 02:36:41.960]  a tenant at one world trade center back in 1970 to uh 1980 and the key point i see a lot of people
[02:36:41.960 --> 02:36:47.560]  are missing uh it goes way back to when they were planning on building the towers they had lawsuits
[02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:51.640]  filed against them from the surrounding buildings saying that you're not going to build this gigantic
[02:36:51.640 --> 02:36:57.560]  tower to fill over to take out 20 or 30 buildings so they had to come up with a design that was
[02:36:57.560 --> 02:37:03.400]  guaranteed not to cause that problem so the original design which was approved in the lawsuit
[02:37:03.400 --> 02:37:11.640]  for drops was to build a center core steel column in the center which would act as a guidepost for
[02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:19.480]  all of the uh suspended floors the floors would be suspended on that center steel core column
[02:37:19.480 --> 02:37:26.520]  and in any event that for whatever reason the tower was collapsing it would pancake it down around
[02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:32.360]  the center steel core so picture that center steel core is a broomstick and the floor is supported on
[02:37:32.360 --> 02:37:40.520]  it and if they started to collapse down on the guidepost there is no ifs ends or buts period
[02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:47.720]  that if the floors started collapsing around the guidepost the guidepost was to be left
[02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:53.160]  standing so you have the entire tower collapse and this massive center steel core column
[02:37:53.160 --> 02:37:58.840]  in the center but instead they were blasted off at perfect intervals and ejected out 600 feet
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:04.600]  well let's say for argument's sake the plane generated 20 000 degrees of heat and
[02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:09.560]  middle for the steel core columns on that floor they didn't have the entire upper floor toppled
[02:38:10.120 --> 02:38:16.120]  and the rest of the steel core column staying in place so there is no ifs ends or buts period
[02:38:16.120 --> 02:38:23.160]  and the story that tower was demolished for the center steel core to drop with the floors that
[02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:30.040]  were pancakeing down no ifs ends or buts and a story absolutely walter regional design of the
[02:38:30.040 --> 02:38:35.320]  world trade center towers and that point you'll find out that that steel core was designed to be
[02:38:35.320 --> 02:38:41.720]  left standing as the guidepost for the collapsing floors all right walter now i want to get into
[02:38:41.720 --> 02:38:45.800]  the main reason you're here and i appreciate you coming on we'll give people your website you have
[02:38:45.800 --> 02:38:50.920]  a new film out for people available on the website and you've got a director's cut coming out soon
[02:38:50.920 --> 02:38:54.600]  that i hope you put on dvd so we can offer it because of course i produced a little documentary
[02:38:54.600 --> 02:38:59.400]  with you in it called comprehensive annual financial reports exposed on info wars dot com
[02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:04.520]  it's on dvd but that was made 12 years ago so much more has happened since then your new update
[02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:09.720]  everything you talked about 12 years ago has now come true uh but but again let's go back to your
[02:39:09.720 --> 02:39:15.240]  awakening what you discovered you got involved in the news media you found out about the comprehensive
[02:39:15.240 --> 02:39:21.080]  annual financial reports and and and and now what's happened because again you expose this you
[02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:27.800]  expose the fact that this is an organized mafia criminal operation every city manager knows
[02:39:28.520 --> 02:39:33.160]  i've had city managers in my studio on other issues and i bring this up and they get this big
[02:39:33.160 --> 02:39:39.080]  giant smile and turn red uh and and say a word and they won't say a word and they just start
[02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:42.680]  laughing you know even though it's been quote patriots one of them was a good guy who's fighting
[02:39:42.680 --> 02:39:46.360]  the nafta highways and i brought this up and he just laughed and turned red during the break and
[02:39:46.360 --> 02:39:51.800]  said i'm not getting into that uh so this is the big delicious secret so let's break it down
[02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:58.440]  well the beautiful part is it's actually not a secret it's there in plain sight the whole game
[02:39:58.440 --> 02:40:03.640]  was the silence to the golden routine never talk about it never mention it uh no one would look
[02:40:03.640 --> 02:40:09.720]  no one would think about it no cognitive thought created but i found out about this back in 1990
[02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:14.040]  there was a governor got elected by the new jim florio in the jersey on the new tax platform
[02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:19.160]  soon as he gets in 2.8 billion dollar tax increase was drafted by the prior administration but he
[02:40:19.160 --> 02:40:27.160]  could have vetoed it there were two dj's uh that were operating at a 101.5 fm in trunton john and kent
[02:40:27.160 --> 02:40:32.840]  we're now out in los angeles the john and ken show well they start doing rabble rousing uh saying
[02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:39.640]  no we can't do this we gotta stop it and repeal this tax increase and uh i called into the show
[02:40:39.640 --> 02:40:45.480]  uh you're just reading from the budget report at the time uh 1990s budget report from new jersey
[02:40:45.480 --> 02:40:50.840]  it wasn't billion on budget six billion off budget service budget 17 billion that available uh
[02:40:50.840 --> 02:40:57.800]  about 25.3 billion and you know john and ken goes well we have to stop those sales so much money
[02:40:57.800 --> 02:41:02.120]  and ten of us got together incorporated a group called hands across new jersey
[02:41:02.120 --> 02:41:06.440]  had to go over looking at the budget revenue and finance uh being a body trading advisor and
[02:41:06.440 --> 02:41:11.800]  dealing with numbers uh you know one dollar uh 10 billion it's just a number kind of where the
[02:41:11.800 --> 02:41:17.400]  population oh my god 10 billion i can't even think they're one goes blank yeah it's a it's just a
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:21.880]  number so i started looking at the budget report and i noticed all the uh income from the autonomous
[02:41:21.880 --> 02:41:26.600]  agencies uh we're not there the uh interest master investment accounts i knew that state had
[02:41:26.600 --> 02:41:31.960]  we're not there i said this is not the whole picture uh the director of the budget Richard

[02:42:41.960 --> 02:42:46.840]  this is the definition of organized crime here they are promoting a 17 billion dollar operating
[02:42:46.840 --> 02:42:53.800]  budget and in the overall picture they're bringing in a three billion and you know i started digging

[02:46:11.880 --> 02:46:15.640]  to talk about the comprehensive anti-financial report i mean now they've had the former
[02:46:15.640 --> 02:46:20.600]  auditor of the name of the air force come out and say it's a great idea they've had governors come
[02:46:20.600 --> 02:46:25.240]  out and talk about hey let's use all this investment surplus to fund everything similar to what
[02:46:25.240 --> 02:46:33.160]  um goes on in alaska so it's really gained ground and i've been to a lot of political events i've
[02:46:33.160 --> 02:46:39.960]  seen c span calls i've seen the governor of texas questioned about it these giant slush funds of
[02:46:39.960 --> 02:46:44.200]  money that is off budget so you only hear about the budget oh there's no money in the budget for
[02:46:44.200 --> 02:46:49.240]  potholes there's no money in the budget for schools there's no money in the budget for state teacher
[02:46:49.240 --> 02:46:54.360]  pensions or police pensions meanwhile they have all these separate investments in universities
[02:46:54.360 --> 02:46:59.240]  have got them school districts water districts tens of thousands of government institutions more than
[02:46:59.240 --> 02:47:04.920]  tens of thousands and walters got all those numbers so walter you're investigating you're you're you're
[02:47:04.920 --> 02:47:11.320]  looking at this uh you're you're fighting tax increases in new jersey on the talk radio
[02:47:12.520 --> 02:47:19.320]  and then you get a copy of the big kahuna the hidden in plain view comprehensive annual financial
[02:47:19.320 --> 02:47:24.920]  report go ahead now i got a copy of the report and i called the two dj's john and ken from one
[02:47:24.920 --> 02:47:29.720]  point five and i said john i got the holy grail of accounting in my hands the state's comprehensive
[02:47:29.720 --> 02:47:34.360]  annual financial report let's go live on there and get welcome on down to the studio we'll see
[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:37.960]  on down to the studio show them the report and go yep this is it and i showed them the bottom
[02:47:37.960 --> 02:47:42.760]  line numbers you go oh so uh for the next uh how are we sat there reading out the bottom
[02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:48.840]  line numbers uh with me giving out analogies i was the last live radio interview that uh station
[02:47:48.840 --> 02:47:55.400]  did they were doing live interviews every single day two or three days but when i came up with uh
[02:47:55.400 --> 02:47:58.840]  the comprehensive annual financial report and started qualifying the scope and degree of
[02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:03.720]  the money that was being held by the state and went live on the air and had one one point five
[02:48:03.720 --> 02:48:08.920]  at about five to seven million listeners that daily uh they got calls from their sponsors
[02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:13.320]  pharmaceutical companies large construction groups uh there's other different companies
[02:48:13.320 --> 02:48:19.560]  if you ever let that guy on the air again you're gonna lose all of our sponsorship now
[02:48:20.680 --> 02:48:25.240]  that ended any live interview the reason they called was you know they were quite aware of how
[02:48:25.240 --> 02:48:29.480]  much money was involved in how much money was flowing through government cities county states
[02:48:30.120 --> 02:48:33.960]  and a lot of them had uh you know there was a lot of grease on the skips and they were getting
[02:48:33.960 --> 02:48:38.200]  millions of dollars not hundreds of millions of dollars that the public didn't even know existed
[02:48:38.200 --> 02:48:44.280]  in the first place because government was investing because government was investing the tax money
[02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:49.800]  with them and spending the tax no it's not just tax money you look at a comprehensive annual
[02:48:49.800 --> 02:48:56.280]  financial report about one third of the gross income is tax income the uh the other portion
[02:48:56.280 --> 02:49:03.240]  is broken up primarily the primary income now is investment income yes and uh tax incomes
[02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:08.840]  come second and the third is enterprise group income so when you see a budget report these
[02:49:08.840 --> 02:49:15.560]  budget reports are selectively created to show where tax income is brought in and tax income is
[02:49:15.560 --> 02:49:20.040]  spent so you go over a budget report with a fine-tooth comb it looks like government's surviving
[02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:25.560]  on tax income when you look at the annual finance report you see a whole different world you know
[02:49:25.560 --> 02:49:30.120]  you can have a uh state saying oh we're seven hundred million dollars short on a budgetary basis
[02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:36.840]  we're gonna have to raise taxes we'll see teachers blah blah blah they look at the same exact uh local
[02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:41.080]  government's annual finance report they can be two and a half billion dollars in the black
[02:49:42.200 --> 02:49:48.920]  you know it's it's the definition of a shell game and the uh sinuses golden rule were you know
[02:49:48.920 --> 02:49:53.640]  no mention of a comprehensive annual finance report for 65 years keep in mind the start
[02:49:53.640 --> 02:50:00.680]  back in 1946 required the full cooperation of the syndicated media control of education and both
[02:50:00.680 --> 02:50:05.880]  political parties they were included in on the game for the last 45 years sent copies of all
[02:50:05.880 --> 02:50:12.280]  the reports and they know it was sacrilege to make open and despiculous mention of these reports
[02:50:12.280 --> 02:50:16.360]  now a lot were cooperating with the game now laughing all the way down to the bank as they spent
[02:50:16.360 --> 02:50:20.840]  the money or had the money invested in their new projects uh real estate ventures and everything
[02:50:20.840 --> 02:50:26.680]  else and ones that uh thought it was wrong they knew that if they mentioned it they'd find themselves
[02:50:26.680 --> 02:50:31.320]  out in the back alley getting their you know what kicked and uh stay there welter back in one minute

[02:52:21.240 --> 02:52:27.320]  walter burion is our guest if you just joined us like xm does in the last hour uh... walter
[02:52:27.320 --> 02:52:34.200]  burion worked uh... as uh... a commodities advisor worked on the stock market and he found
[02:52:34.200 --> 02:52:40.200]  out in 1990 when he was battling tax increases in new jersey on syndicate radio and local radio
[02:52:40.760 --> 02:52:44.920]  that there was something called a comprehensive annual financial report a double set of books
[02:52:44.920 --> 02:52:49.880]  that were the profits of government investment this isn't tax money it isn't pensions it isn't
[02:52:49.880 --> 02:52:55.720]  what you're told about the budget it's the real set of books so walter recap that and give people
[02:52:55.720 --> 02:53:02.120]  the history of the comprehensive annual financial report this is started in chicago the 1313 mafia
[02:53:02.120 --> 02:53:07.640]  model and then explain how it's spread out and why this is so important this shell game where
[02:53:07.640 --> 02:53:12.760]  they're cutting off teachers shutting down state parks national parks you know firing over half the
[02:53:12.760 --> 02:53:19.240]  police in some areas and not fixing sidewalks but but meanwhile the government is just rolling
[02:53:19.240 --> 02:53:25.400]  in in in in deep deep wells of money go ahead okay just one correction uh... was a commodity
[02:53:25.400 --> 02:53:30.840]  trading advisor and never trade stocks i follow the stock market commodity trading advisor on the
[02:53:30.840 --> 02:53:37.240]  thing go ahead yep the uh... just one not a key point here when i start national disclosure uh...
[02:53:37.240 --> 02:53:43.640]  uh... i started national disclosure in june of 98 and uh... how do you get a call from uh...
[02:53:43.640 --> 02:53:48.440]  school teachers from around the country college professors and i would mention to them your school
[02:53:48.440 --> 02:53:52.680]  district puts out a comprehensive annual financial report i said do you see going to your eighth grade
[02:53:52.680 --> 02:53:58.600]  class saying high class here's our school's budget report and here's our school district's
[02:53:58.600 --> 02:54:04.040]  comprehensive annual financial report let's see if we can spot the differences that find
[02:54:04.040 --> 02:54:09.080]  our walking papers so damn fast it wouldn't know what hit him you know the colleges uh...
[02:54:09.080 --> 02:54:13.240]  especially these colleges that are saying oh we uh... we have a shortfall or budgetary uh
[02:54:13.240 --> 02:54:18.440]  basis we have to raise tuition is by fifteen twenty percent cut back to teach your salaries
[02:54:18.440 --> 02:54:24.600]  if you look at these schools endowment funds okay i looked at ASU in 99 they had 11 billion
[02:54:24.600 --> 02:54:30.840]  dollars in their endowment fund okay here at the same time they were saying oh we have a shortfall
[02:54:30.840 --> 02:54:35.080]  or budgetary basis we're gonna have to raise tuition is by eight percent their endowment
[02:54:35.080 --> 02:54:40.040]  funds generated more in return than all tuition is collected combined yeah that's why they're
[02:54:40.040 --> 02:54:44.760]  into football teams and and the school because it's not even real it's just a front it's like
[02:54:44.760 --> 02:54:51.160]  ut last time i checked over 60 billion in one slush fund uh... they finance sports teams
[02:54:51.160 --> 02:54:56.040]  clear channel radio uh... and again it's water district school districts they've all
[02:54:56.040 --> 02:55:01.720]  all just did they take our tax money they invested and then now the investment's bigger than the taxes
[02:55:01.720 --> 02:55:06.760]  they rule everything and that's not enough now they want all the roads now they want license plate
[02:55:06.760 --> 02:55:12.760]  readers now they want to i mean just just the total way it all boils down to the money involved
[02:55:12.760 --> 02:55:17.960]  everything is done to to the money involved nothing more nothing less smoke screens are
[02:55:17.960 --> 02:55:22.040]  put up left and right to keep the public looking off the left field as these guys are cutting
[02:55:22.040 --> 02:55:26.280]  hundred billion dollar deals and you know the other side of the field for the public being
[02:55:26.280 --> 02:55:31.560]  entertained in la la land they were thinking of the basics now i've had thousands of phone

[03:00:26.520 --> 03:00:32.680]  done since then this is a fact and it's now entered the political debate thanks to walter
[03:00:32.680 --> 03:00:39.000]  i mean he is the progenitor of this hidden in plain view just like i have the washington post
[03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:45.000]  from two days ago just reporting oh the cia did make those fake bin laden videos oh they didn't
[03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:50.280]  make them for domestic political brainwashing to scare you into wars they made it to discredit
[03:00:50.280 --> 03:00:55.560]  him in the muslim world they just admit it like it's no big deal because we've exposed it they come
[03:00:55.560 --> 03:00:59.880]  out and admit yeah we're growing the opium in afghanistan and i know i keep hammering this point
[03:00:59.880 --> 03:01:05.160]  because it's so incredible well it's the same thing with the comprehensive annual financial reports
[03:01:05.160 --> 03:01:10.280]  i brought this up to politicians i brought this up to rick perry i brought this up to city managers
[03:01:10.280 --> 03:01:14.120]  i brought and folks when you bring this up to them and i've seen it done in a lot of meetings
[03:01:14.120 --> 03:01:18.040]  now in town halls they'll be just ignoring everybody and they don't care if you grab about
[03:01:18.040 --> 03:01:21.880]  taxes being too high they're ready for that when you bring up hey you got a double set of books
[03:01:21.880 --> 03:01:28.440]  you got two three four five times sometimes more investments that are off the books these aren't
[03:01:28.440 --> 03:01:33.400]  because people have built-in rationals you know you tell teachers or cops this especially and
[03:01:33.400 --> 03:01:40.200]  they'll go well that's for my pension fund those government investments no no no no no no no they're
[03:01:40.200 --> 03:01:45.160]  now going to cut your pension funds on budget to pay back banks money that's not owed because here's
[03:01:45.160 --> 03:01:51.160]  the scam i used to ask walter this in the last 12 years is it the government taking over corporations
[03:01:51.160 --> 03:01:55.080]  or is it the global corporation taking over government he said well basically it's a merger
[03:01:55.080 --> 03:02:00.200]  but if you look at this now and i agree with him the big global offshore banks are now setting up
[03:02:00.200 --> 03:02:05.560]  their g20 world government saying a world government run by banks they've kind of double crossed
[03:02:05.560 --> 03:02:11.560]  government by selling derivatives as the investments to the pension funds public pension funds cities
[03:02:11.560 --> 03:02:16.520]  counties water districts universities you've seen harvard you know losing habits endowment or whatever
[03:02:16.520 --> 03:02:23.720]  to actually get them under their control so it appears to be a coup not just a merger but to
[03:02:23.720 --> 03:02:29.320]  but to simplify this uh remember about six months ago islam was saying no we're not going to pay you
[03:02:29.320 --> 03:02:36.200]  the you know this uh 800 billion or whatever you say we owe uh and then they the people rioted
[03:02:36.200 --> 03:02:41.320]  they said no they started arresting bankers and the bankers said we apologize we've looked at our
[03:02:41.320 --> 03:02:46.040]  investment assets government investment assets with us we actually have a surplus you don't
[03:02:46.040 --> 03:02:52.520]  have to pay any money anymore so it turned out it wasn't a oh my gosh derivatives are a crisis
[03:02:52.520 --> 03:02:57.080]  they were just threatening everyone through financial terror to do it now again for those
[03:02:57.080 --> 03:03:03.400]  who just joined us recap uh a you know a commodity trading advisor on record in 1990 in new jersey
[03:03:03.400 --> 03:03:09.800]  fighting tax increases of the next six seven years did research did global discovery global uh
[03:03:09.800 --> 03:03:16.760]  you know uh disclosure of the fact and i didn't believe walter when i interviewed him in 97 i didn't
[03:03:16.760 --> 03:03:20.120]  think it was a liar either i went down to the state of texas got the comprehensive annual
[03:03:20.120 --> 03:03:23.960]  financial report and it said that they had half a trillion dollars and just liquid investment
[03:03:23.960 --> 03:03:28.920]  profit that year i didn't you know i went and checked ut with its 40 billion then now it's 60
[03:03:28.920 --> 03:03:33.640]  plus billion i didn't you know i went and checked travis county with its billion bucks i went and
[03:03:33.640 --> 03:03:38.280]  checked manhattan just like he said it was over a trillion i went and checked the state of new york
[03:03:38.280 --> 03:03:43.160]  it was almost a trillion i went and checked all these places and it was and guess what they were
[03:03:43.160 --> 03:03:48.120]  online they weren't even hiding this now walter i'm going to completely shut up and give you the
[03:03:48.120 --> 03:03:53.960]  absolute floor now the next few sub segments put it in layman's terms how important this is because
[03:03:53.960 --> 03:03:57.320]  you were trying to finish your point we hit the break when the politicians get up there and say
[03:03:57.320 --> 03:04:02.440]  we got to get rid of the national park the state park we got to close your favorite park uh you
[03:04:02.440 --> 03:04:06.680]  know they could just not mow the grass but they want you to know it's closed the fence is going up
[03:04:06.680 --> 03:04:12.520]  you can't have uh potholes fixed california is announcing we're not going to fix roads
[03:04:12.520 --> 03:04:17.960]  you know we're going to lay off half the cops of this town so that's it that's a psychological
[03:04:17.960 --> 03:04:24.040]  play uh on the population yeah as i mentioned this is all everything that is done period i don't
[03:04:24.040 --> 03:04:30.200]  care what it is it's not due to the money involved in government has uh turned into a corporate
[03:04:30.200 --> 03:04:39.240]  for-profit enterprise utilizing the population as a productivity unit to be drained of value
[03:04:39.240 --> 03:04:45.480]  and their productivity and yeah i'm going back to the last break i mentioned that uh you know
[03:04:45.480 --> 03:04:48.840]  when uh someone called me i'd always stop them and ask them if they knew how much cash they had
[03:04:48.840 --> 03:04:53.080]  in their pockets uh what their checking account balance says what their investment worth was
[03:04:53.080 --> 03:04:58.200]  and their net worth and everyone knew without exception not one person that called when they
[03:04:58.200 --> 03:05:03.320]  called me about their city county state school district complaining about tax increases had a
[03:05:03.320 --> 03:05:10.040]  clue of what the uh that entities uh you know cash on and uh investment totals or net worth was
[03:05:10.040 --> 03:05:17.080]  an entire vacuum and void was created intentionally so in the comprehension of an entire population
[03:05:17.080 --> 03:05:21.080]  of the basics which each and every one of us knows in our own personal lives since we're
[03:05:21.080 --> 03:05:26.600]  little kids up until when we die we keep it in the back of our minds and here government is operating
[03:05:26.600 --> 03:05:33.160]  yeah having created this entire vacuum and void in every single venue for people not even think
[03:05:33.160 --> 03:05:39.720]  about it not to have a cognitive thought yeah so there it is absolutely amazing they pulled
[03:05:39.720 --> 03:05:45.880]  that one off to be able to void out the basics uh that we carry with us each and every day now on
[03:05:45.880 --> 03:05:54.280]  the derivative aspect the uh in 2008 uh keep in mind government on all levels state city county and
[03:05:54.280 --> 03:06:00.840]  so forth were actively involved with the derivatives and pennsylvania is a pretty good uh cap report
[03:06:00.840 --> 03:06:07.000]  to look at for the state on the d they list their derivative activity and uh since i mentioned that
[03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:12.600]  the they started uh expanding their sections making it harder to say but if you look at an older
[03:06:12.600 --> 03:06:18.760]  report you know pennsylvania as a state was dealing in more derivatives in muralins as a company
[03:06:18.760 --> 03:06:26.680]  and did and the derivative play going back to 2000 alan greenspan as quoted from wall street
[03:06:26.680 --> 03:06:31.960]  journal said he was concerned about the 80 trillion dollar a year derivative market
[03:06:32.680 --> 03:06:40.600]  internationally now between 2000 and 2008 they had expanded the international derivative
[03:06:40.600 --> 03:06:47.240]  market up to 600 trillion dollars they were building this bloom big big bloom but on derivatives
[03:06:47.240 --> 03:06:52.600]  they're very important and 95 percent of the public doesn't comprehend this because it's
[03:06:52.600 --> 03:06:58.200]  never been discussed on a derivative all you're doing is buying time uh six months five months a
[03:06:58.200 --> 03:07:04.840]  year or two years out on a specific commodity or stock options and so forth locking in a price
[03:07:04.840 --> 03:07:10.200]  at this time so the price changes you can cancel out your trade and collect the equity difference
[03:07:10.200 --> 03:07:15.480]  so if you think say gold is at a thousand bucks you think it's going to drop down to 500 you could
[03:07:15.480 --> 03:07:22.440]  sell a gold contract six months five months later drops down to 500 you buy back the gold contract
[03:07:22.440 --> 03:07:30.040]  that cancels out the trade but you just click in 500 or on a derivative contract uh that would be
[03:07:30.040 --> 03:07:35.080]  about 50 000 dollars made and this is from the price going down even though you may not even own
[03:07:35.080 --> 03:07:39.320]  one ounce this is how the banks and the government accounts for controlling the metals market they
[03:07:39.320 --> 03:07:45.720]  would massively sell the derivatives market driving the price down which the cash market was then
[03:07:45.720 --> 03:07:51.320]  depended upon for pricing and that's now even come out on c-span in federal hearings they've
[03:07:51.320 --> 03:07:57.480]  now been caught but the bottom line is the government is just bathing in our tax money
[03:07:57.480 --> 03:08:01.880]  that they have invested they set up a sting operation they knew the bubble was going to burst
[03:08:01.880 --> 03:08:06.840]  and on derivative contracts you can jump in there for five minutes uh five hours five days and once
[03:08:06.840 --> 03:08:11.800]  you buy and sell or sell on buy whichever direction you're going in you close out your trade you're
[03:08:11.800 --> 03:08:17.240]  out of the picture you walk with the cash if you made a profit well bf's bubble was building on the
[03:08:17.240 --> 03:08:22.520]  housing market the government now they're especially managed accounts i mean the large
[03:08:22.520 --> 03:08:27.240]  managed accounts both domestic and international government outsourced in the 80s and they have
[03:08:27.240 --> 03:08:33.400]  management funds and credits with uh dutch bank uh millennium fund one millennium fund two you know
[03:08:33.400 --> 03:08:38.280]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars each one of these accounts uh and
[03:08:38.280 --> 03:08:41.960]  what they did was a position play they went heavily short all the stock indexes
[03:08:42.920 --> 03:08:48.600]  both domestic and international heavily long the dollar they went long the dollar they went
[03:08:48.600 --> 03:08:55.640]  to heavily long us bonds and uh they went heavily short the crude oil now in the last
[03:08:56.440 --> 03:09:02.040]  two three months of 2008 after these position plays were replaced all of a sudden they start
[03:09:02.040 --> 03:09:07.960]  dumping their physical holdings and stocks driving the market down they heavily sold that crude
[03:09:07.960 --> 03:09:14.520]  oil more and more and more crude oil costs from 145 a barrel down to at the bottom peak 28 dollars
[03:09:14.520 --> 03:09:20.840]  a barrel in the low trade okay the stock index falls apart the uh dollar jumped everyone's
[03:09:20.840 --> 03:09:25.800]  saying oh the dollar's going down through the floor and a little bit yeah i find that humorous
[03:09:25.800 --> 03:09:31.560]  it went from 71 on the dollar index up to 89 which was it's a month and a half which
[03:09:31.560 --> 03:09:38.440]  was as quick as spike and run in the history of the dollar index on the upside that was due to the
[03:09:38.440 --> 03:09:44.360]  factor as government had positioned on these positions they wanted to perpetuate the collapse
[03:09:44.360 --> 03:09:49.160]  so they started selling their physical holdings which meant the pension funds took a loss and
[03:09:49.160 --> 03:09:53.960]  everything else that took a loss uh all across the country as they dumped on the market but
[03:09:53.960 --> 03:10:00.520]  this perpetuated the collapse and thus that guaranteed them a massive profit on their
[03:10:00.520 --> 03:10:05.080]  derivatives play and let me stop you let me stop you their products and the syndicated media now
[03:10:05.080 --> 03:10:11.960]  come out oh my god this is terrible everyone's lost their money empires destroyed oh well
[03:10:13.080 --> 03:10:18.120]  they forget to mention that went on a derivative trade yeah for every dollar lost in one account
[03:10:18.120 --> 03:10:24.280]  a dollar is credited to another account and here you had you know trillions probably about
[03:10:24.280 --> 03:10:31.880]  20 to 25 trillion units i have 30 trillion worldwide that changed hands through the uh the
[03:10:31.880 --> 03:10:36.520]  this collapse in the derivative market yeah but who took the other side of the trade hi walter
[03:10:36.520 --> 03:10:41.000]  let me stop you on the front page walter see a red this very important a red staples button
[03:10:41.560 --> 03:10:46.600]  and it says uh you know cap for downloads click on that button it goes to my download directory
[03:10:46.600 --> 03:10:52.360]  for example caffers but when you get down to utah you'll see uh right above it us treasury
[03:10:52.360 --> 03:10:57.640]  click on that and then you'll see march derivative report for 2008 for the banks
[03:10:57.640 --> 03:11:03.160]  click on that pdf file it's put out by the comptroller of turnstays and it shows the top
[03:11:03.720 --> 03:11:10.760]  30 banks and their derivative holdings now uh it notes so on page one uh second paragraph
[03:11:10.760 --> 03:11:19.720]  that five commercial banks controlled 97 percent of all derivative activity from all banks
[03:11:19.720 --> 03:11:25.880]  that scroll down about two thirds through the report you'll get down to table one on table one
[03:11:25.880 --> 03:11:32.920]  you'll see jp morgan chase was ten that uh net worth of 1.4 trillion dollars we look at their nominal
[03:11:32.920 --> 03:11:39.960]  derivative value the value of these contracts are trading 90 trillion dollars now that 90
[03:11:39.960 --> 03:11:44.440]  trillion was not jp morgan chase's oh we got a break it was for their clients oh we got to

[03:13:59.320 --> 03:14:06.040]  gold isn't for you ted anderson president of mitis resources one of the world's premier gold and
[03:14:06.040 --> 03:14:10.840]  precious metal investing firms i get it you wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government
[03:14:10.840 --> 03:14:15.720]  is doing a great job that the fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy
[03:14:15.720 --> 03:14:21.000]  that social security would be there for you that's not what's happening you might even pass on gold
[03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:26.120]  if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that the dollar wouldn't lose value or that your
[03:14:26.120 --> 03:14:31.480]  retirement would be secure if all looks rosy to you then now is not the time to buy gold for the
[03:14:31.480 --> 03:14:37.480]  realist there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold since 2001 the us dollar
[03:14:37.480 --> 03:14:43.320]  index has tanked 30 percent while gold has risen 300 percent right now savvy investors are adding
[03:14:43.320 --> 03:14:48.520]  gold to their portfolios you should too find out what they know call us and i'll send you 10 reasons
[03:14:48.520 --> 03:15:01.560]  why gold will do very well free 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 that's 800 686 2237 the question is
[03:15:01.560 --> 03:15:09.000]  where should the american people draw their line in the sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy
[03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:15.000]  a republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule
[03:15:15.000 --> 03:15:19.160]  two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our land they think they're
[03:15:19.160 --> 03:15:26.600]  on our water children our education our money we have to define who we are and what we will tolerate
[03:15:26.600 --> 03:15:33.000]  somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the patriot uprising we have the facts we have the
[03:15:33.000 --> 03:15:38.040]  constitution we have the bill of rights we have common law knowledge is power ladies and gentlemen
[03:15:38.040 --> 03:15:43.160]  and i'm so excited to be able to offer you don't tread on me rise the republic tyranny is upon us
[03:15:43.160 --> 03:15:48.120]  but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the american people is rising a new tool in the info
[03:15:48.120 --> 03:15:54.840]  war don't tread on me order it at info wars dot com or prison planet dot com or call toll free 888
[03:15:54.840 --> 03:16:06.600]  253 3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films we are all right walter brian is our guest
[03:16:06.600 --> 03:16:12.600]  you don't have to believe walter brian uh though he's a great guy incredible go look up the
[03:16:12.600 --> 03:16:15.800]  comprehensive annual financial report for your school district you name it now since he's been
[03:16:15.800 --> 03:16:22.120]  exposing it it's about 2000 they have made the public versions that are easy to get a little
[03:16:22.120 --> 03:16:28.360]  thinner but he'll tell you how to fair it amount but uh you know i was asking the question of walter
[03:16:28.920 --> 03:16:34.600]  from his research you know it it looks like this derivatives bubble they created well we have the
[03:16:34.600 --> 03:16:39.320]  timber wolf documents and others from golden sacks where they admit it was engineered we know it was
[03:16:39.320 --> 03:16:44.440]  engineered but then it was also designed to take over many of the states counties and cities
[03:16:45.160 --> 03:16:49.320]  and walter during the break was agreeing with me he said some states were involved but overall
[03:16:49.320 --> 03:16:54.920]  it's the federal government and big mega banks consolidated together vertically integrating
[03:16:54.920 --> 03:17:00.520]  the entire economy walter on the course we're on they're now setting up their mega police state to
[03:17:00.520 --> 03:17:08.120]  enforce this robbery uh what will things look like in the next year to two years if we don't somehow
[03:17:08.120 --> 03:17:13.960]  start reversing this you know they're creating a new world order uh structure as we all know and
[03:17:13.960 --> 03:17:18.360]  the actual new world order is being orchestrated from the united states being that uh there's an
[03:17:18.360 --> 03:17:23.720]  expression yeah he owns the cookie jar makes the rules when you look at the collective government
[03:17:23.720 --> 03:17:28.920]  investments with the banks with the perpetrators with the interns they actually own the banks and
[03:17:28.920 --> 03:17:34.120]  perpetrators and insurance companies by investment through the primary investor they own the major
[03:17:34.120 --> 03:17:40.760]  fortune 500 companies by collective investment okay so the whole structure here is to maintain this
[03:17:40.760 --> 03:17:46.920]  entertainment game for the population as they consolidate ownership i go back to when i mentioned
[03:17:46.920 --> 03:17:51.240]  on the red staples button on my front page and going to my download directory and hitting us
[03:17:51.240 --> 03:17:56.680]  trajectory and getting the march derivative report for the banks jp morgan chase was holding
[03:17:56.680 --> 03:18:03.560]  90 trillion dollars worth of nominal value and derivatives now that was not primarily jp morgan
[03:18:03.560 --> 03:18:09.880]  chases but it was directing as clearing agents for their major clients to where their major clients
[03:18:09.880 --> 03:18:16.760]  cities counties states federal governments okay and when you talk 90 trillion as i mentioned in 2000
[03:18:16.760 --> 03:18:23.960]  the entire world derivative market was 80 trillion and here in 2008 is jp morgan chase holding
[03:18:23.960 --> 03:18:31.240]  90 trillion dollars nominal value of derivatives okay and that's just one account now if you want
[03:18:31.240 --> 03:18:38.440]  one thing that will take years and cause the stars to fall from the sky metaphorically if the public
[03:18:38.440 --> 03:18:44.120]  ever got the cognitive thoughts yeah keep in mind like i said a vacuum and void was created in the
[03:18:44.120 --> 03:18:51.320]  entire population's comprehension to the basics but if you look at government pension funds which
[03:18:51.320 --> 03:18:56.840]  they've taken over the marketplace based on their collective ownership i put one up at the top of my
[03:18:56.840 --> 03:19:03.240]  web page uh uh calsters which is for the california teacher's retirement fund about 130 billion you
[03:19:03.240 --> 03:19:07.960]  know and it's one of the best funds in the country consistent state performance and so for it uh you
[03:19:07.960 --> 03:19:11.960]  can come that way and can also a pie chart where you can pick up a different segments of the pie
[03:19:11.960 --> 03:19:19.320]  chart and i'll show their holdings both domestic and international real estate projects domestic
[03:19:19.320 --> 03:19:24.280]  international cash loaned out to other companies domestic and international but you can answer the
[03:19:24.280 --> 03:19:30.600]  question oh my god look the overall look how much they own that's just one account and that's why
[03:19:30.600 --> 03:19:35.720]  it's new world order thousands of these different yeah big and small well that's why it's a new
[03:19:35.720 --> 03:19:42.200]  world order is it's the merger of the megabanks with all the governments of the world as one big
[03:19:42.200 --> 03:19:48.920]  monolithic corporate board that go and and so that's why in texas they've now announced this is a
[03:19:48.920 --> 03:19:55.960]  houston chronicle 1 500 plus dollar fines with license plate reading toll roads they don't even
[03:19:55.960 --> 03:20:02.040]  tell you it's a toll road and then there's no judge no jury and now they take your house for a $300
[03:20:02.040 --> 03:20:08.440]  unpaid water bill they take your house for a thousand dollar unpaid i mean and and and they're
[03:20:08.440 --> 03:20:12.920]  just they're just coming they're gonna steal everything and turn everything into prisons
[03:20:12.920 --> 03:20:18.040]  and they're not gonna stop i mean it's easy opportunity and and one question i've asked
[03:20:18.040 --> 03:20:23.480]  people every person i talk to i say would you give your 14 15 year old son card belongs to
[03:20:23.480 --> 03:20:28.040]  write his own allowance check and everyone says no way i would never do that i said well that's
[03:20:28.040 --> 03:20:33.320]  exactly what we've done with our government local city county state school district they've
[03:20:33.320 --> 03:20:37.880]  been laughing all the way down to the bank every single day playing a show game uh entertaining
[03:20:37.880 --> 03:20:43.240]  the population with distraction and misdirection lindsay low hand you know and and the public
[03:20:43.240 --> 03:20:48.920]  doesn't even ask the basic questions of you know or forget asking the basic questions the comprehensive
[03:20:48.920 --> 03:20:54.440]  annual finance report or annual financial report for government shows the collective
[03:20:54.440 --> 03:21:00.520]  totals over a year as decades and also shows the budget so when you look at a budget report you're
[03:21:00.520 --> 03:21:04.600]  just seeing the budget for the year and selectively created one at that when you look at the annual
[03:21:04.600 --> 03:21:10.200]  finance report you're seeing the decades of community well especially investment funds
[03:21:10.200 --> 03:21:17.080]  enterprise operations the gross income i started a disclosure a national disclosure in june of 98
[03:21:17.640 --> 03:21:25.880]  of the comprehensive annual finance report and the uh g asb you know initially the report was
[03:21:25.880 --> 03:21:31.720]  created by g o f a government i got a break again long segment coming up walter brian stay there

[03:25:05.800 --> 03:25:12.760]  folks it's economic conquest it's world government by private international banks that have come in
[03:25:12.760 --> 03:25:19.960]  and taken over our governments from researching this separately from burien confirming what his
[03:25:19.960 --> 03:25:28.600]  research the mafia over 80 years ago learned in chicago how to get cities to invest with their
[03:25:28.600 --> 03:25:34.760]  mafia operations then and basically they just keep the money so they took the chicago 1313 model
[03:25:34.760 --> 03:25:39.560]  that became mainstream in the 50s and went nationwide they set up the national security
[03:25:39.560 --> 03:25:48.600]  dictatorship in 47 and now they own it all and it's in they are the imperial power it's not free
[03:25:48.600 --> 03:25:53.400]  market and now they're going to use the carbon tax to shut down any of their competition i had a
[03:25:53.400 --> 03:25:57.400]  usa today headline i've been meaning to cover the last two days i'm going to dig through all my
[03:25:57.400 --> 03:26:04.280]  stacks and find it but basically they're they're celebrating that for the first time record uh
[03:26:04.280 --> 03:26:10.440]  you know you know payrolls drop to record lows you know a worker pay shrinks while government
[03:26:10.440 --> 03:26:18.520]  jobs expand and i'll find that headline so they're dumbing everybody down they're taking over
[03:26:20.520 --> 03:26:24.600]  now we see governments completely imploding they're saying all the pension fund money's
[03:26:24.600 --> 03:26:29.000]  got to go to the bankers so is this just the government from your research with the big
[03:26:29.000 --> 03:26:34.280]  corporations they're just running a ruse saying uh well the corporations took over government
[03:26:34.280 --> 03:26:40.040]  i think no no no no no no no no government had the massive flow of equity coming into government
[03:26:40.040 --> 03:26:45.160]  they took five percent you know year four three four five percent and they would invest it with
[03:26:45.160 --> 03:26:50.520]  the banks where rich houses uh corporations equities you know domestic and worldwide well
[03:26:50.520 --> 03:26:55.000]  we have five percent this year five percent the next year there's only so many nickels and a dollar
[03:26:55.000 --> 03:27:01.240]  they took it all over within three decades and all in the majority of uh you know uh the value
[03:27:01.240 --> 03:27:08.120]  through their investments and going back to 1946 uh GFOA government financial officers
[03:27:08.120 --> 03:27:12.600]  association was created and started promoting the annual finance reporting accounting structure
[03:27:12.600 --> 03:27:17.320]  for government government to change it into a pay-as-you-go structure into a corporate
[03:27:17.880 --> 03:27:23.720]  for-profit uh collection vehicle and uh you know they started promoting it in the cities and counties
[03:27:23.720 --> 03:27:30.040]  the states started coming on by 1970 it had become the standard and uh the group that was assigned
[03:27:30.040 --> 03:27:36.600]  to uh oversee the accounting principle was called GASP government accounting standards board which
[03:27:36.600 --> 03:27:40.760]  now writes the policy through transmittal letters on the accounting principles within account first
[03:27:40.760 --> 03:27:46.280]  and by the way both of those organizations are 100 private associations and the boys when they
[03:27:46.280 --> 03:27:52.840]  first started off GFOA which on that 1313 crowd uh was actually transitioned into metro out of
[03:27:52.840 --> 03:27:58.360]  Chicago which moved out they bought 400 acres uh an old horse farm outside of Louisville Kentucky
[03:27:58.360 --> 03:28:05.240]  and started new headquarters uh starting about uh 20 years ago but the uh the boys you know the
[03:28:05.240 --> 03:28:10.200]  international cartel of people uh the wealthy family said well we'll create destruction this
[03:28:10.200 --> 03:28:14.760]  way we'll have an unlimited cash flow for our investments we want to build a project start a
[03:28:14.760 --> 03:28:20.360]  new corporation you know here's this money we can have invested in us guaranteeing our success
[03:28:20.360 --> 03:28:23.720]  and that was the initial approach where the government grew and developed and brought in
[03:28:23.720 --> 03:28:29.160]  more money which was making more money on their investment return they became so massive so large
[03:28:29.720 --> 03:28:36.360]  that they became the controllers of the world markets based on the equity they had under management
[03:28:36.360 --> 03:28:42.440]  they can make and break any firm any bank any brokerage house by that uh money being applied
[03:28:42.440 --> 03:28:49.160]  now as i mentioned on that 90 trillion in that rotos held by J.P. Morgan Chase the primary uh
[03:28:49.160 --> 03:28:54.360]  clients were local and federal government accounts which were they were acting as a clearing agent
[03:28:54.360 --> 03:29:00.680]  for for those derivative positions and the money just simply was sucked out of the world economy
[03:29:00.680 --> 03:29:06.680]  at the end of 2008 and you have to think of where was that equity transferred to it was transferred
[03:29:06.680 --> 03:29:13.160]  to these specialty management accounts as a step in the takeover and consolidation of ownership
[03:29:13.160 --> 03:29:18.360]  now J.P. Morgan Chase all of the banks that were not trading the rotas they got burned by no
[03:29:18.360 --> 03:29:24.440]  protection J.P. Morgan Chase comes in and buys out of 10 you know 20 cents on the dollar you know
[03:29:24.440 --> 03:29:32.280]  has an extra perk you know for their cooperation and this structure as i mentioned it's very basic
[03:29:32.280 --> 03:29:37.640]  corporate for-profit structure the annual finance report of government or the they put one word at
[03:29:37.640 --> 03:29:42.840]  the front going out of comprehensive annual finance report you can go on google and do a search say
[03:29:42.840 --> 03:29:49.880]  for example you won the city of burbank put the city of burbank in quotes and then caffer cafr after
[03:29:49.880 --> 03:29:55.880]  bank pops right up for downloading city of los angeles county of los angeles same thing now
[03:29:55.880 --> 03:30:00.680]  you heard about los angeles on the news the whole work's short on money and blah blah blah
[03:30:00.680 --> 03:30:07.000]  well i put out a post uh listing uh la city's caffer and la county's caffer i'm gonna ask
[03:30:07.000 --> 03:30:12.760]  you a question alex what do you think the annual operating budget is for la county uh i don't know
[03:30:12.760 --> 03:30:22.600]  take it yes four billion dollars 17 and a half billion dollars okay with about 250 billion
[03:30:22.600 --> 03:30:28.120]  dollars in investment funds when i kind of brought that note out on a national post on my email list
[03:30:28.120 --> 03:30:33.640]  all of a sudden la disappeared from the news headlines but here's the bottom line this is
[03:30:33.640 --> 03:30:39.240]  very important so important this would cause the earth to shake and the stars to fall from the heavens
[03:30:39.240 --> 03:30:44.360]  therefore quickly speaking if the public bought this cognitive thought i smile like you know one
[03:30:44.360 --> 03:30:49.080]  tension from the top of my web page and on my articles page which you can click and go to you'll
[03:30:49.080 --> 03:30:52.920]  see the new york state retirement fund caffer listing of investments when you go down through
[03:30:52.920 --> 03:30:58.920]  listing of investments either california or new york you'll see the top profit makers in order are
[03:30:59.880 --> 03:31:06.120]  the banks and financial institutions number one number two let's give me uh the pharmaceutical
[03:31:06.120 --> 03:31:11.000]  companies pharmaceutical companies the healthcare industry groups number one you now know why the
[03:31:11.000 --> 03:31:16.840]  healthcare bill passed as it passed because it guarantees profits for the government on their
[03:31:16.840 --> 03:31:21.560]  ownership of the healthcare and the pharmaceutical companies and also their participation with the
[03:31:21.560 --> 03:31:25.560]  insurance companies the number one profit makers from the healthcare bill guaranteed them profits
[03:31:25.560 --> 03:31:29.160]  by funneling in trillions of dollars it was taxpayer revenue to guarantee themselves their
[03:31:29.160 --> 03:31:35.080]  profits number two are the financial banks and brokerage industries number three are the world
[03:31:35.080 --> 03:31:41.480]  companies and number four are the war industry groups and we see this in every one of these
[03:31:41.480 --> 03:31:46.600]  large reports now i mentioned pension fund reports because they list the individual
[03:31:46.600 --> 03:31:51.560]  investments were a city or a county report they list totals but not where the money is invested
[03:31:51.560 --> 03:31:58.520]  so good models to look at are the pension fund reports because you can be assured that the
[03:31:58.520 --> 03:32:03.080]  cities and counties that have specialty funds self-insurance funds advanced for liability
[03:32:03.080 --> 03:32:07.480]  accounts they're investing their money into that approximately the same manner as the pension
[03:32:07.480 --> 03:32:13.000]  funds do and when you start looking at one report after another before you see how massive this is
[03:32:13.000 --> 03:32:19.080]  how diversified world ownership with domestic ownership real estate projects in fact all
[03:32:19.080 --> 03:32:24.040]  the pension funds i noticed over the last two uh two years they started especially real estate
[03:32:24.040 --> 03:32:30.280]  spec accounts to buy up commercial and property houses uh because they knew they were about to
[03:32:30.280 --> 03:32:36.600]  depress it stay there i i i found the article out of usa today private pay shrinks to historic
[03:32:36.600 --> 03:32:44.040]  lows as government payouts rise but separately they're now getting many counties are laying off
[03:32:44.040 --> 03:32:50.280]  half their police or more they're not fixing the roads they're cutting teacher pay so why are they
[03:32:50.280 --> 03:32:55.960]  so greedy i mean if the big central banks with government and i say corporate takeover because
[03:32:55.960 --> 03:33:00.440]  the Rockefellers Rothschilds and others that you know the golden sacks people they're in their
[03:33:00.440 --> 03:33:05.320]  piloting government uh so it's these top global corporations teamed up with the government i
[03:33:05.320 --> 03:33:09.720]  understand your point is in dollars and cents it's it's the it's the government's taken over
[03:33:09.720 --> 03:33:14.600]  everything but but but that's their force they've also used the chinese slave labor to destroy all
[03:33:14.600 --> 03:33:20.920]  their economic manufacturing competition so this is a game of criminal scorched earth consolidation
[03:33:20.920 --> 03:33:26.520]  my issue for you is though if they've already taken everything over why are they wanting to
[03:33:26.520 --> 03:33:32.600]  make everybody poor to control us why are they wanting to squeeze the teachers and the police
[03:33:33.560 --> 03:33:38.920]  i guess because we're a bunch of dumb schmucks who put up with it why not i mean break down
[03:33:39.880 --> 03:33:44.280]  from your research i remember you 12 years ago talking about derivatives and the derivatives bomb
[03:33:44.280 --> 03:33:48.200]  and how they were using derivatives to take over i want walter beryon to look into the crystal ball
[03:33:48.200 --> 03:33:53.800]  and tell me where is this going what is their master plan what's going to happen if we don't
[03:33:53.800 --> 03:34:00.600]  cause an awakening to this this fraud and somehow reverse it well they're creating one massive police
[03:34:00.600 --> 03:34:07.000]  state for uh yeah the big foot on top of the entire world population with a group at the top
[03:34:07.000 --> 03:34:14.040]  calling all the shots controlling all situations and uh reaping uh the whirlwind of reward from
[03:34:14.040 --> 03:34:20.200]  trillions falling into their structure which they have control over and using the carbon
[03:34:20.200 --> 03:34:26.120]  tax to destroy selectively any industry we try to start i mean this is total slavery well i go
[03:34:26.120 --> 03:34:30.600]  down to the point of look at those investments where they're invested as i give the examples on
[03:34:30.600 --> 03:34:37.400]  my web page and you'll see that every policy decision that's made from government is specifically
[03:34:37.400 --> 03:34:42.360]  on the underlying motive was to generate and create their own profits guaranteeing their own
[03:34:42.360 --> 03:34:47.960]  profit and that's why they put cancer viruses in the vaccines that's why they put poison in the water
[03:34:47.960 --> 03:34:51.560]  that's why we have government documents about how they want to kill us by 60
[03:34:51.560 --> 03:34:55.400]  because they all because they're making their profits off the health care as they're killing us
[03:34:55.400 --> 03:34:59.800]  they're making their profits off the wars as they kill us they're making their profits off the
[03:34:59.800 --> 03:35:05.000]  banking as they steal people's pension funds and i and i guess they think their police state
[03:35:05.000 --> 03:35:09.160]  is going to be able to enforce this walter well the key point here is they've done such an
[03:35:09.160 --> 03:35:14.840]  excellent excellent job of taking over the entire investment arena and i point to the government
[03:35:14.840 --> 03:35:20.760]  pension funds as uh one of the takeover vehicles if you look at the return from those funds which
[03:35:20.760 --> 03:35:27.640]  is massive what i brought forward is you can create what i call a trf on tax retirement fund
[03:35:27.640 --> 03:35:32.200]  structure for any city county state school district where you create an exact same thing as a pension
[03:35:32.200 --> 03:35:38.520]  fund but it's intentionally designed not to pay a salary and benefit of retirement but to pay the
[03:35:38.520 --> 03:35:45.800]  ongoing budgetary obligations for that city that county that school district so all taxation can be
[03:35:45.800 --> 03:35:51.720]  phased out incrementally all across the country now listen the globalist wrote a hundred years ago
[03:35:51.720 --> 03:35:56.200]  that the problem of industrialization is it was going to make us all fabulously rich
[03:35:56.200 --> 03:36:01.880]  so they finance marks and angles on record to come in with a new scam to con people back into
[03:36:01.880 --> 03:36:06.360]  slavery and and so basically what they've done is they've created as ron paul and others have
[03:36:06.360 --> 03:36:12.120]  pointed out a financial system through fractional reserve banking that is impossible to pay back
[03:36:12.120 --> 03:36:18.040]  and so they've created a system which which will enslave us again no matter how hard we work and
[03:36:18.040 --> 03:36:24.280]  no matter what we do they're going to raise taxes until everything goes to them and then they're
[03:36:24.280 --> 03:36:29.800]  going to convert the economy to pure prisons torture war and surveillance which is then meant
[03:36:29.800 --> 03:36:37.800]  to carry out the mass extermination of us so they're financing a giant panoptagon extermination grid
[03:36:37.800 --> 03:36:44.680]  that funds itself in the financial consolidation of waging financial siege shutting us off then
[03:36:44.680 --> 03:36:49.720]  making us dependent on them then their government eugenics run health care then carries out our
[03:36:49.720 --> 03:36:57.640]  soft kill take definition of a takeover yes even mine all the issues are very basic and fundamental
[03:36:57.640 --> 03:37:02.840]  regarding what the scope of the takeover of what's owned what's bought you know who's pledging what
[03:37:03.800 --> 03:37:07.640]  never people never mentioned never were from syndicated media and thousands of people call
[03:37:07.640 --> 03:37:13.240]  me water how come our local newspaper or syndicated media doesn't report on this why don't they do
[03:37:13.240 --> 03:37:19.240]  their job they say they do an excellent job they do exactly what they're paid to do and that is not
[03:37:19.240 --> 03:37:25.080]  mentioned um mentioned or a word that is what they're paid to do let me ask your question
[03:37:25.080 --> 03:37:30.520]  why in the last three years then have i seen a shift uh whereas they would lie about the
[03:37:30.520 --> 03:37:34.120]  government shipping and heroin and cocaine and growing it now they just admit it and say it's
[03:37:34.120 --> 03:37:39.720]  for your own good uh before they would say bin laden tapes were real now they admit they're fake
[03:37:39.720 --> 03:37:44.600]  and that they put them out uh they would deny they were putting cancer viruses in the vaccines
[03:37:44.600 --> 03:37:49.160]  now they say they're there it's not a problem they would deny they were kim trailing now the
[03:37:49.160 --> 03:37:53.400]  white house science r comes out and says we are spraying the skies it's secret it's for your own
[03:37:53.400 --> 03:37:59.880]  safety uh you know now uh this has become so mainstream i'm suddenly getting on all these
[03:37:59.880 --> 03:38:04.760]  radio stations most of them mom and pops with some of them big ones and and and and the word i get
[03:38:04.760 --> 03:38:09.880]  is the globalists don't even care that they think they're so powerful now they don't even care
[03:38:11.160 --> 03:38:17.000]  to take over by their of the bank's burgers houses equity markets worldwide they never
[03:38:17.000 --> 03:38:20.920]  repeat their mention never were from syndicated media i mean the silence is golden routine is
[03:38:20.920 --> 03:38:26.440]  still played out there and it's the most important factor because everything stems from it but on
[03:38:26.440 --> 03:38:30.680]  the remedy factor it's very important to realize as i mentioned look at those return on those pension
[03:38:30.680 --> 03:38:36.920]  funds you can administratively remodify any local government tomorrow and set it up on a structure
[03:38:36.920 --> 03:38:42.600]  where it takes all of its budgetary obligations based on the pension fund let's put this in layman's
[03:38:42.600 --> 03:38:48.200]  terms let's put it in layman's terms if we the people take over travis county and take the billions
[03:38:48.200 --> 03:38:52.600]  of dollars that they put investments that they never tell the public about we could restructure
[03:38:52.600 --> 03:38:57.480]  that however we wanted to that's the big secret so you're saying we need counties and cities
[03:38:57.480 --> 03:39:02.360]  as you said 12 years ago on my show as you said four years ago as you're saying today
[03:39:02.920 --> 03:39:09.240]  this could be done anywhere and the public has like some psychological brainwashing point where
[03:39:09.240 --> 03:39:15.000]  they just can't i mean has anyone tried to do what you're saying 20 000 sound lights to keep them
[03:39:15.000 --> 03:39:21.800]  distracted off in la la land as the boys continue business as usual and this is so basic and fundamental
[03:39:21.800 --> 03:39:26.840]  but when you never hear people never mention their word not a cognitive thought generated
[03:39:26.840 --> 03:39:31.480]  from the syndicated media controlled education both political parties that void and vacuum
[03:39:31.480 --> 03:39:38.280]  maintains now they started to break i've worked 10 over 10 years now uh did 550 radio programs a
[03:39:38.280 --> 03:39:44.520]  lot of articles and a lot of people are starting to comprehend and there was a an economist from
[03:39:44.520 --> 03:39:50.600]  california harvard graduate carl herman two days ago he put out two careful articles calling for a
[03:39:50.600 --> 03:39:56.040]  complete audit review for uh doing what i'm mentioning here to pay his out taxation in california
[03:39:56.680 --> 03:40:02.040]  uh i mean a few corrections on his articles and he's now you know uh doing another uh
[03:40:02.040 --> 03:40:07.400]  account as to his alert and another large article but the bottom line is people are starting to get
[03:40:07.400 --> 03:40:12.520]  a cognitive thought of the basics and they're starting to look they're starting to digest
[03:40:12.520 --> 03:40:17.480]  they're starting to see the simple reality of what i'm mentioning regarding structuring local
[03:40:17.480 --> 03:40:21.640]  governments itself okay but i like to do this i like we're gonna come back and talk about the
[03:40:21.640 --> 03:40:25.640]  solution and i agree with you in the last five minutes it's it's similar but on a bigger level
[03:40:25.640 --> 03:40:32.440]  as to what um you know uh places uh like states like alaska have done but but as we go to break
[03:40:32.440 --> 03:40:37.160]  here and in the next two minutes from your study of these people in their takeover and i've read
[03:40:37.160 --> 03:40:43.960]  their you know their seminal white papers on what they're planning they don't even want us here
[03:40:43.960 --> 03:40:50.120]  they say this global financial takeover is a means to an end that they don't like us on the earth
[03:40:50.120 --> 03:40:53.800]  they're all a bunch of really whacked out environmentalists and golden sacks top people
[03:40:53.800 --> 03:40:59.720]  give you massive money to you know the land grabs they say they want an extermination program and
[03:40:59.720 --> 03:41:03.480]  i don't care listeners of your laughing at that i've read the documents on air i made the film in
[03:41:03.480 --> 03:41:09.480]  game this is real but but but from your own view financially they are what they want to bankrupt
[03:41:09.480 --> 03:41:16.280]  everything they want to destroy the average person uh a why do they want that and and b what will the
[03:41:16.280 --> 03:41:21.720]  world look like and what's the time frame if we don't reverse this picture this analogy alex say
[03:41:21.720 --> 03:41:27.560]  for example in your neighborhood your block okay you can hide to steal everyone's net worth and
[03:41:27.560 --> 03:41:32.840]  rob all their money and take ownership of their houses indirectly no one knew it was you okay once
[03:41:32.840 --> 03:41:38.520]  you've stolen what they've had and you build up this massive empire all neighbors become liabilities
[03:41:40.120 --> 03:41:46.520]  you gotta either run them into the ground where uh they can't attack you or ground if you've stolen
[03:41:46.520 --> 03:41:53.720]  everything that they have and on the corporate one world order they've managed to lock in ownership
[03:41:53.720 --> 03:41:59.000]  you know through this little bit by little bit each year it's where they own it all now by investment
[03:41:59.000 --> 03:42:05.400]  and the public to a certain extent is a liability now someone who qualifies you know what they're
[03:42:05.400 --> 03:42:11.000]  doing is a very big liability you know so i kind of watch my uh over my shoulder once in a while
[03:42:11.000 --> 03:42:16.360]  but it's not me saying it it's there's no i've never used the word conspiracy in my entire
[03:42:16.360 --> 03:42:23.000]  lifetime regarding this issue never it is all black and white they print their own reports
[03:42:23.000 --> 03:42:27.320]  and you have to sit down and start doing a look in collective totals and you see the takeover
[03:42:27.320 --> 03:42:31.800]  becomes evident very quickly we gotta go to break come back and finish up on that and then solutions
[03:42:31.800 --> 03:42:35.960]  we'll have you back very soon especially when the new dvd comes out we'll give folks your website
[03:42:35.960 --> 03:42:40.600]  but that is the bottom line they've stolen the world they say hey we work to steal this you're
[03:42:40.600 --> 03:42:45.720]  a bunch of idiots you don't even care we're gonna kill your butt because the future doesn't need us
[03:42:45.720 --> 03:42:52.920]  human life isn't just cheap it's seen as a negative it's like garbage taken out the garbage well

[03:46:22.920 --> 03:46:26.840]  invader and i said where does it say they may arresting because you're not allowed to have
[03:46:26.840 --> 03:46:33.000]  guns in chicago it's mob run and it said that they are having to look at charges uh because
[03:46:33.000 --> 03:46:38.920]  there's a currently has a statute outlawing the possession of handguns so uh i mean you know
[03:46:38.920 --> 03:46:44.200]  they have to arrest them you're not allowed to defend yourself uh going back to walter bery and
[03:46:44.200 --> 03:46:51.640]  walter fire out your website for folks that want to check it out it's uh caffer one dot com c a fr one
[03:46:51.640 --> 03:46:57.000]  dot com just do a search for government wealth on google you'll get about uh 50 million heads my
[03:46:57.000 --> 03:47:01.080]  website is number one and a document or i did back in 2000 called the biggest game in town is
[03:47:01.080 --> 03:47:07.560]  number one i have a 58 million heads but i mentioned an economist by the name of carls herman uh
[03:47:07.560 --> 03:47:14.440]  earlier out of california he just says most recent article he put out noting that uh you know the
[03:47:14.440 --> 03:47:20.840]  university of california setting budgetary shortfalls laid off teachers uh haven't the teachers
[03:47:20.840 --> 03:47:27.640]  take a 10 15 cut in salary uh didn't allow 23 under students in because of budget shortfalls
[03:47:27.640 --> 03:47:36.520]  he noted that from one fifth of one percent one fifth of one percent of the investment capital
[03:47:36.520 --> 03:47:42.440]  that he looked at from just three local california governments would have paid the entire shortfall
[03:47:42.440 --> 03:47:48.440]  one fifth of one percent yeah so the the cognitive thinking is starting to click in the minds of other
[03:47:48.440 --> 03:47:53.480]  people from around the country and as i mentioned the earth will shake and the stars will fall when
[03:47:53.480 --> 03:47:59.640]  the general population gets a clue of the comprehension that they can phase out all
[03:47:59.640 --> 03:48:05.720]  taxation in their city their county their state their school district by implementing the same
[03:48:05.720 --> 03:48:12.600]  investment vehicle that government used to take it all over by investment and just like we exposed
[03:48:12.600 --> 03:48:18.120]  the federal reserve we can expose this thanks to you and others uh work but uh from the math you've
[03:48:18.120 --> 03:48:22.680]  done just to you know because i know it varies from county city state federal international
[03:48:22.680 --> 03:48:31.000]  with government but but statistically what is it 70 more money in investments that isn't on budget
[03:48:31.000 --> 03:48:37.320]  uh and and budgets are usually 30 i mean what's that ratio of money when you look at an annual
[03:48:37.320 --> 03:48:43.800]  final annual finance report now the large entity breaks down to their number one uh part of the
[03:48:43.800 --> 03:48:50.120]  gross income is investment income number two is tax income and number three is enterprise income
[03:48:51.000 --> 03:48:54.120]  but when you look at a budget report looks like a hundred percent taxing coming you over
[03:48:54.120 --> 03:48:59.480]  will find to come account for a nickel diamond penny because like if you took uh most of the
[03:48:59.480 --> 03:49:03.320]  chapters out of the bible and look the first ten chapters and told her one to read in this oh i've
[03:49:03.320 --> 03:49:07.960]  read the bible no you've read the first ten chapters they took out the rest the comprehensive
[03:49:07.960 --> 03:49:15.240]  annual finance report is the complete book and i mentioned to people always uh look at uh prior
[03:49:15.240 --> 03:49:19.080]  issues because when i came out with national disclosure they're they're oops we get a problem
[03:49:19.080 --> 03:49:25.480]  here i started ksp started kicking out transmittal letters uh modifying the cap for reporting from
[03:49:25.480 --> 03:49:32.920]  them gross uh yeah shown in the collective columns to net shown in the collective columns
[03:49:32.920 --> 03:49:37.960]  so i have a big difference in gross and net so you know it's important to get older chapters
[03:49:37.960 --> 03:49:41.320]  look at them and then look at a newer one to see the difference and the government's greedy
[03:49:41.320 --> 03:49:46.120]  they've got plenty of money massive investments but they're raising taxes everywhere are threatening
[03:49:46.120 --> 03:49:51.720]  to steal people's pension funds holding them financially hostage true okay see your cattle
[03:49:51.720 --> 03:49:57.880]  rancher alex bro is everyone listening to cattle rancher we have a bunch of cattle out in our field
[03:49:57.880 --> 03:50:02.680]  we take care of them we protect them we feed them we give them hay yeah every once in a while we
[03:50:02.680 --> 03:50:07.880]  have a nice barbecue and feed all of our friends from one but the bottom line is we're taking care
[03:50:07.880 --> 03:50:13.000]  of them because they're a wealth generation of source for us we sell our cattle to get butchered
[03:50:13.000 --> 03:50:20.280]  and turned into hamburgers okay now the lion came walking around you know our territory we wouldn't
[03:50:20.280 --> 03:50:25.560]  mind uh you know uh you know that line may not even be attacking our cattle we're gonna shoot it
[03:50:26.120 --> 03:50:31.880]  because it may attack our cattle i'm not sure why they've been trying to kick you out we're out of
[03:50:31.880 --> 03:50:35.880]  time that's the end of the show walter let me say bye to you here at the end read transmission
