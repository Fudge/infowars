[00:33.600 --> 00:43.440]  Hi RNUSA radio news. I'm Jody Jordan. Spain's high number of swine flu cases may be due
[00:43.440 --> 00:48.040]  to the popularity of holidays to Mexico. Here's Harold Heckel.
[00:48.040 --> 00:53.560]  Spain actually is the hardest hit country in Europe at the moment, but that is probably
[00:53.560 --> 00:58.600]  most easily explained by the fact that many Spaniards traditionally like to enjoy summer
[00:58.600 --> 01:02.480]  breaks in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:02.480 --> 01:07.400]  Spain trails Mexico, the United States and Canada, and the number of people diagnosed
[01:07.400 --> 01:11.240]  with swine flu. Dr. Richard Beeser is with the CDC.
[01:11.240 --> 01:14.640]  We're not out of the woods. The information that we've been getting over the past couple
[01:14.640 --> 01:19.760]  days is encouraging and swine flu fears have led to violence in Egypt where no flu cases
[01:19.760 --> 01:25.160]  are reported. Police fired shots in the air and tear gas at pig owners who stone them
[01:25.160 --> 01:30.760]  to prevent government workers from slaughtering the animals is a precaution against the flu.
[01:30.760 --> 01:34.400]  This is IRNUSA radio news.

[02:34.560 --> 02:39.400]  Jack Kemp, a former quarterback for the Buffalo Bills who represented Western New York for
[02:39.400 --> 02:46.000]  nine terms in Congress, has died of cancer in suburban Washington. He was 73. Former
[02:46.000 --> 02:50.920]  campaign manager Ed Fulner remembers when Kemp would tell stories about his football days
[02:50.920 --> 02:55.800]  and was upset that his black colleagues were treated as second class. That's why Jack
[02:55.800 --> 03:00.160]  always, when he was campaigning, whether it was for Congress or for Vice President or
[03:00.160 --> 03:05.520]  whether he was campaigning on somebody else's behalf, always insisted that the bottom rungs
[03:05.520 --> 03:10.040]  of the ladder had to stay in place so everybody had an opportunity to climb up the ladder
[03:10.040 --> 03:17.640]  as high and as far as she or he could go. It sounds yesterday of team officials checking
[03:17.640 --> 03:22.800]  for victims after the roof collapsed at the Dallas Cowboys Indoor Training Facility.
[03:22.800 --> 03:28.280]  A special team's coach broke his back and 11 more people were hospitalized. For the
[03:28.280 --> 03:34.280]  latest news and analysis, log on to IRNUSANews.com.

[03:38.920 --> 03:43.520]  the world are you anyway? This is Andy Willoughby speaking for the Three Step Plan. The Three
[03:43.520 --> 03:48.280]  Step Plan is a business system designed to help families start their own home-based business.

[04:04.600 --> 04:08.680]  Pope Benedict says he hopes his upcoming trip to the Holy Land will give encouragement
[04:08.680 --> 04:13.840]  to the Christians there and also promote peace and reconciliation between Israel and the
[04:13.840 --> 04:20.360]  Palestinians. I ask you all to join me in praying for the afflicted peoples of the region.
[04:20.360 --> 04:26.440]  In a special way, I ask that you remember the Palestinian people who have endured great
[04:26.440 --> 04:31.600]  hardship and suffering. He spoke about his trip during his weekly Sunday blessing to pilgrims
[04:31.600 --> 04:37.000]  and tourists in St. Peter's Square. Abombing has killed four people, including two children
[04:37.000 --> 04:42.760]  in a busy market in southern Himalayan province in Afghanistan. While militants seem to target
[04:42.760 --> 04:49.000]  military forces, children and others are also sometimes victims. Here's Jason Strasioso.
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.640]  Russian-provided explosive devices are typically aimed at Afghan officials or international
[04:53.640 --> 04:58.720]  or Afghan troops, but U.S. military says that 1,800 Afghans were killed or wounded last
[04:58.720 --> 05:02.000]  year in such a bomb attack. The violence threatens to overshadow the
[05:02.000 --> 05:07.920]  August 20th election, the second since the ouster of the Taliban in 2001. Human rights
[05:07.920 --> 05:12.760]  officials already suspect potential fraud because of so many women have signed up to
[05:12.760 --> 05:17.600]  vote. Afghan males in the conservative countryside often do not let their women relatives outside
[05:17.600 --> 05:22.920]  the house and, therefore, try to register to vote for women relatives. The chairman of
[05:22.920 --> 05:28.000]  Independent Human Rights Commission is worried that those males may use those registrations
[05:28.000 --> 05:33.720]  to perpetrate fraud at the ballot box. I'm Jody Jordan for IRN-USA Radio News.
[05:33.720 --> 05:46.200]  Health Lesson 101. Swine flu is the topic of news. Fear and panic seems to be at the
[05:46.200 --> 05:51.320]  top of our emotions. Fact. If your colon is cleansed of toxins,
[05:51.320 --> 05:57.200]  you are less susceptible to any flu virus. Viruses love unhealthy bodies and attack our
[05:57.200 --> 06:02.640]  system to make us sick, so get prepared before the attack. Drink your way to health. Order

[07:08.160 --> 07:20.640]  Jones. We are live. Thank you so much for joining us. It is the 23rd day. It is the
[07:20.640 --> 07:31.720]  third day of May 2009. We're going to be live here for the next two hours. And what has
[07:31.720 --> 07:36.160]  the New World Order Global Crime Syndicate been up to while they've been distracting
[07:36.160 --> 07:42.520]  and diverting the public with what all the evidence indicates is a complete and total
[07:42.520 --> 07:49.160]  psi-op psychological warfare operation against the people of the planet to distract the planet
[07:49.160 --> 07:55.160]  from all the big decisions that are being made, the final haggling and the formation
[07:55.160 --> 08:00.200]  of world government between different governments and private interests and power players, the
[08:00.200 --> 08:05.400]  attempt in the United States to pass the global carbon tax, hundreds and hundreds of taxes
[08:05.400 --> 08:13.200]  to regulate every facet of our lives, to openly and publicly be paid to private banking families
[08:13.200 --> 08:18.800]  Al Gore, you name it. Republicans are involved. Democrats are involved. There are three climate
[08:18.800 --> 08:24.480]  change lobbyists, global warming lobbyists. They're now changing to the term climate change.
[08:24.480 --> 08:28.600]  A White House memo just got leaked. I could already tell you months ago they were changing
[08:28.600 --> 08:33.120]  their terms, but we'll go over it. In fact, on record, I've said that. So they're passing
[08:33.120 --> 08:38.920]  this new tax to micromanage every facet of your life. It will all be selectively enforced,
[08:38.920 --> 08:42.400]  so big globalist corporations don't have to follow any of these rules. This has meant
[08:42.400 --> 08:48.120]  to shut you down so they can turn the vicious, parasitic, blood-sucking government bureaucrats
[08:48.120 --> 08:52.400]  and control freaks and all the dumbed-down people they've created who can't get a real
[08:52.400 --> 08:57.160]  job in the real economy to come literally suck off the rest of us. That's what's being
[08:57.160 --> 09:02.600]  set up. So just a total implosion of society. They're busy trying to pass amnesty bills
[09:02.600 --> 09:07.680]  for total open borders. They're busy Obama announcing that he'll continue the torture,
[09:07.680 --> 09:12.600]  continue the secret arrest, continue secret military tribunals for foreigners and U.S.
[09:12.600 --> 09:19.480]  citizens, expanding the wars, Israel getting ready to attack Iran, massive war being geared
[09:19.480 --> 09:24.120]  up for in Pakistan. All of this is going on, but the average person isn't aware. They're
[09:24.120 --> 09:31.600]  busy wringing their hands and the bird flew, the swine flew, the deadly flew. It's all
[09:31.600 --> 09:36.160]  over. Give me shots. And here in Austin, Texas and around the country, they've set up emergency
[09:36.160 --> 09:41.880]  tent cities for the influenza, the Dell Children's Center, and people are showing up in thousands
[09:41.880 --> 09:47.880]  all over the country and the world. One-third of people didn't show up at work last week
[09:47.880 --> 09:54.080]  in England, Fairmongering, wearing masks. Don't worry, the government's there. It's
[09:54.080 --> 10:03.400]  got the shots. So now it's gone from a form of Obama, Obama too. Give me flu shots. Give
[10:03.400 --> 10:12.520]  me time to flu antiviral. Healthy. Please, oh God. Only martial law will save us. Only
[10:12.520 --> 10:20.560]  force inoculations will save us. Please. Only, only, only locking down cities and arresting
[10:20.560 --> 10:34.040]  anyone that doesn't take the injections will save us. Oh man, I know I'm warmed up here.
[10:34.040 --> 10:40.880]  So I do want to take a lot of calls on this issue, the swine bird slash human flu that
[10:40.880 --> 10:47.200]  is clearly engineered. I mean, it's all over Japanese and Chinese and British and German
[10:47.200 --> 10:52.800]  news and Mexican news and Russian news and all these scientists coming out and saying,
[10:52.800 --> 10:57.360]  this thing is clearly engineered. It has all the genetic markers that came out of nowhere.
[10:57.360 --> 11:01.200]  That's why your grassroots scientists and virologists and health workers who weren't
[11:01.200 --> 11:04.920]  part of the Fairmongering, who weren't part of the staged Fairmongering that the feds
[11:04.920 --> 11:08.960]  and the Mexican feds put out, that's why they were so concerned up front and bought the
[11:08.960 --> 11:14.200]  feds line. Because this thing, you see, viruses and Obama, by the way, have a speech Saturday,
[11:14.200 --> 11:18.120]  a little four minute blurb from the White House YouTube room. This guy's giving like
[11:18.120 --> 11:25.640]  50 speeches a day, more than I do. This guy's more of a New World Order info warrior than
[11:25.640 --> 11:30.400]  I am a Liberty and Freedom info warrior. It's hard to counter the endless spew coming out
[11:30.400 --> 11:36.280]  of the, that thespian actor's mouth, that front man for the real shadow government
[11:36.280 --> 11:41.160]  Northcom system. But Obama came out and said, why are we so scared about this? Now it may
[11:41.160 --> 11:45.160]  turn out to be nothing, but it doesn't matter. I'm going to spend billions getting ready
[11:45.160 --> 11:48.560]  for the next flu and it's going to be deadly. Just what Napolitano had a Homeland Security
[11:48.560 --> 11:53.400]  said last Sunday, you know, seven, eight days ago. He said, because this thing's out of
[11:53.400 --> 11:59.000]  the blue. It has no pedigree. It has no history. It has no other virus. It's really connected
[11:59.000 --> 12:06.160]  to you. See of the thousands of flu viruses and different mutations that scientists find
[12:06.160 --> 12:10.080]  each year in universities and private labs and vaccine makers, the good, the bad and
[12:10.080 --> 12:14.360]  the ugly. It runs the gamut from good doctors and good companies to bad companies and government
[12:14.360 --> 12:21.640]  and the black op folks and the people bringing you eugenics. But you see this totally new
[12:21.640 --> 12:27.400]  virus appearing wrong time of year in the wrong hemisphere never happens. And the thing
[12:27.400 --> 12:33.280]  is a never before seen mix with different parts of pig, different parts of bird, different
[12:33.280 --> 12:38.080]  parts of human and some weird insect hanging off of the end of it. They're now saying
[12:38.080 --> 12:43.720]  all of this going on and it's rapidly mutating and it spreads really fast and it infects
[12:43.720 --> 12:49.320]  40, 50% of people that come in contact with it. So the 10 to 15% that no regular flues
[12:49.320 --> 12:56.880]  have even bad mutations. That's why so many scientists and virologists were so concerned.
[12:56.880 --> 13:00.400]  Because the Mexican government and the US government and the World Health Organization,
[13:00.400 --> 13:04.960]  the UN were out saying that this could be yet tens of millions could die. The greatest
[13:04.960 --> 13:08.840]  threat ever facing humanity, the greatest public health threat in 90 years since the
[13:08.840 --> 13:15.960]  swine flu outbreak of 1918. Those were all the headlines. It's over. Run for the hills.
[13:15.960 --> 13:19.400]  And so we got on air and said, well folks, it looks like a hoax. I said last Saturday,
[13:19.400 --> 13:23.200]  last Sunday, right through the week, I said, looks like a hoax. And we talked to doctors
[13:23.200 --> 13:27.360]  like Sherry Tenpenny who thought it was overblown. We talked to other people who thought it was
[13:27.360 --> 13:32.080]  you know, basically the end of the world. Like the media was hyping. But the issue here
[13:32.080 --> 13:38.440]  is that they've used this as a dry run to bring in the infrastructure of tyranny and
[13:38.440 --> 13:43.800]  the police state and have CBS news, Fox, CNN, everybody. I'm sure you've seen it. We played
[13:43.800 --> 13:48.440]  clip it for clip this week saying, well, it's sad, but martial law is the only thing that
[13:48.440 --> 13:52.880]  will save us under level six. And we are going to have to enforce the noculations of those
[13:52.880 --> 13:57.000]  that refuse to take it. And if you refuse, we're going to forcibly inject you and then
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.600]  put you in a camp. So that was introduced. And well, we got to do this to save humanity.
[14:02.600 --> 14:07.320]  We got to do this to save the earth. If we don't, it's going to be the end of the world.
[14:07.320 --> 14:11.480]  And so that's introduced into your mind. And CBS news came out with the executive orders
[14:11.480 --> 14:19.480]  and said, yes, under executive orders, forced inoculation. You go to the camp and then they
[14:19.480 --> 14:23.880]  say, oh, well, maybe this isn't really bad. But the UN World Health Organization, Obama,
[14:23.880 --> 14:28.160]  the Republicans, all of them are saying, even if this isn't deadly and a false alarm, it's
[14:28.160 --> 14:32.280]  getting us ready for another pandemic that we know is going to hit and that we know is
[14:32.280 --> 14:35.920]  going to be deadly. And when it happens, we're going to have to basically forcibly lock down
[14:35.920 --> 14:42.080]  the cities and inoculate you. I mean, here's the cover of the Wall Street Journal yesterday.
[14:42.080 --> 14:49.000]  The age of pandemics and it shows Chinese police in mask and quarantining hotels and
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.040]  they're jerking people off planes in the U.S. and has match suits like it's like it's, you
[14:54.040 --> 14:58.720]  know, the beginning of the movie 28 days later. And it's just, I mean, it's terrible. It's
[14:58.720 --> 15:02.720]  like this stuff is airborne Ebola, they're saying, but it's not. Turns out it's a very
[15:02.720 --> 15:07.280]  mild flu, though it is engineered. And now the concern is you can mutate into something
[15:07.280 --> 15:12.240]  harmless or mutate into something even more deadly because it is airborne and unknown
[15:12.240 --> 15:18.080]  to, again, all these other flues have a pedigree like a breed of dog, like a Boston Terrier
[15:18.080 --> 15:25.480]  or a Beagle. You know, they have a pedigree. This virus is manufactured and you say that
[15:25.480 --> 15:30.600]  you get attacked. I've been attacked by MSNBC on TV and in print. I've been attacked on
[15:30.600 --> 15:36.280]  TV by CNN and in print. I've been attacked by at least, it's got to be, I didn't count
[15:36.280 --> 15:41.280]  them up more than seven or eight other mainstream news articles I saw. And I'm not even looking
[15:41.280 --> 15:45.800]  for these anymore. I get attacked so much. And it would say the crazy website, prison
[15:45.800 --> 15:53.360]  planet dot com said this could be a engineered virus. Well, I mean, and you didn't mention
[15:53.360 --> 15:58.280]  that I was linking the Japanese and Russian and British scientists and top virologists
[15:58.280 --> 16:04.160]  saying this thing is totally novel. Looks like it was engineered. No, you just attacked
[16:04.160 --> 16:09.120]  me and said I was a cook. But then I guess they did actually link to the article that
[16:09.120 --> 16:14.960]  had all the evidence, but it's still bizarre. Now, listen, what has this served as a distraction
[16:14.960 --> 16:19.960]  for? Oh, let me tell you, I've now finally read the entire treaty. I have to admit I'd
[16:19.960 --> 16:23.760]  read parts of it in the past. It's worse than we thought it would have essentially banned
[16:23.760 --> 16:30.360]  all firearms, ban reloading as explosives manufacture, give all your records to the UN. Yes, it's
[16:30.360 --> 16:34.640]  official when we get back, they're coming out of your gun. Before you throw away your

[20:35.800 --> 20:49.760]  great talk radio? Search no more. We are the GCN Radio Network. That's right, we are shouting
[20:49.760 --> 21:14.120]  right back at the devil, the New World Order. You better start standing up and doing more
[21:14.120 --> 21:20.480]  than shouting at these private bankers. By the way, I meant to print it. I was on thomas.loc.gov
[21:20.480 --> 21:24.480]  and thought, hey, why don't I check out that Ron Ballbill to audit the private Federal
[21:24.480 --> 21:32.640]  Reserve? And I want to say it had 116 sponsors. I'll pull it up during the break and I hit
[21:32.640 --> 21:36.240]  print. It didn't print when I left my house. I got to get a new printer. That thing is
[21:36.240 --> 21:39.760]  really doing weird stuff. People are like, why don't you just surf the Internet while
[21:39.760 --> 21:42.560]  you're on air? Well, that would take time. You got to have them all printed out in the
[21:42.560 --> 21:46.920]  stack of stuff. Why didn't Limbaugh have the stack of stuff? Because with the Internet,
[21:46.920 --> 21:50.320]  you can't be scanning around. Even if you have a bookmark, you know computers freeze
[21:50.320 --> 21:58.240]  up and do stuff. You got to have it in your hand. Besides, I've actually got to go into
[21:58.240 --> 22:04.240]  thomas.loc.gov and here on the spot, my brain works so good until I'm on the spot on air.
[22:04.240 --> 22:13.120]  What is that? HR 1206, I think? Yeah, that's the bill number. 1207. There you go. Good.
[22:13.120 --> 22:18.040]  Well, I'll pull it up. Doesn't matter. Some good news there. So this whole swine flu thing
[22:18.040 --> 22:23.680]  and it's not swine flu. Pigs don't have it. Pigs aren't spreading it. That's been confirmed.
[22:23.680 --> 22:29.840]  The governments have admitted that from day one. The Hog Association here in the United
[22:29.840 --> 22:34.360]  States, whatever its name is, they've said, look, our pigs aren't dying. That is not the
[22:34.360 --> 22:38.560]  case. China is killing a bunch of pigs. Middle East is killing the pigs. Egypt is killing
[22:38.560 --> 22:44.600]  all its pigs. It's ridiculous. This is so people don't think, wait a minute, this came
[22:44.600 --> 22:48.480]  from a lab. Where did this virus come from? That's why day one, the establishment says,
[22:48.480 --> 22:55.440]  oh my gosh, it is a pig virus. And then they get to sell billions and billions of dollars
[22:55.440 --> 22:59.160]  of vaccines. They get to sell billions and billions of dollars of Tamiflu. Right here
[22:59.160 --> 23:03.760]  in Austin, Texas, Tuesday morning, they had big 18 wheelers full of Tamiflu pull into
[23:03.760 --> 23:08.680]  a facility down by the airport being the old airport being guarded by police, 20 plus
[23:08.680 --> 23:13.520]  police cars. We got some footage of it. Everybody out there freaking out. They've set up emergency
[23:13.520 --> 23:20.040]  tents at the Children's Hospital outside for pandemics. And then they've been fear mongering
[23:20.040 --> 23:23.680]  behind the scenes, telling the health authorities at the state level. We've confirmed this.
[23:23.680 --> 23:29.280]  Oh, we're really at level six. We don't want to panic the public. Oh, it's so deadly. Oh,
[23:29.280 --> 23:34.120]  there have been hundreds of deaths in Mexico from it. Meanwhile, 30 plus thousand deaths
[23:34.120 --> 23:38.600]  a year in the U.S. Tens of thousands of deaths in Mexico every year, hundreds and hundreds
[23:38.600 --> 23:44.640]  of thousands on average, 200 plus thousand a year worldwide from normal flues. Generally
[23:44.640 --> 23:50.320]  old folks or folks that get dehydrated, you know, it can kill you. Especially if you live
[23:50.320 --> 23:53.840]  alone. It's usually folks that live alone. They don't get out of bed for three days.
[23:53.840 --> 24:01.160]  They don't drink water and they die. Well, cold can kill you. Now, Monia can kill you.
[24:01.160 --> 24:04.920]  No Americans have died. One person who was sick in Mexico City got brought up here to
[24:04.920 --> 24:11.120]  die. A 23 month old toddler that health problems his whole poor life. Sorry for the child.
[24:11.120 --> 24:17.240]  But he had poor health his whole life. And we it's very sad. But the issue here is why
[24:17.240 --> 24:23.160]  then did the media and the government type this? They did it because the economies imploding
[24:23.160 --> 24:27.920]  Chrysler went under. There's all this news. It was coming to a head that Obama's expanding
[24:27.920 --> 24:32.640]  the wars, continuing the torture, continuing the secret arrest, moving people from Guantanamo
[24:32.640 --> 24:37.040]  to secret camps overseas and building new ones there in the U.S. and Wyoming of all
[24:37.040 --> 24:41.800]  places. All of this going on and happening saying, no, you know, we're going to keep
[24:41.800 --> 24:47.200]  the secret tribunals, all of this. Now it's not in the news. Now it's not being discussed.
[24:47.200 --> 24:57.280]  I want to take a lot of calls today with your take on this situation. 877-590-5525. 877-590-5525.
[24:57.280 --> 25:04.200]  Now I know folks in Mexico have trouble calling toll free numbers. So dial 512-836-0590 for
[25:04.200 --> 25:09.520]  our namesake, the station we broadcast out of syndicate out of news radio 590 KLBJ. It's
[25:09.520 --> 25:17.920]  512-836-0590 from folks in Mexico. We did get some YouTube videos posted from reporters
[25:17.920 --> 25:22.880]  known by me as being credible in the past up on infowars.com for God like productions
[25:22.880 --> 25:29.640]  and others. And they're down there reporting that, and then I did confirm, my wife speaks
[25:29.640 --> 25:34.120]  and reads Spanish, so I printed off some articles, showed them to her. I did confirm
[25:34.120 --> 25:40.320]  that you have Mexico City locked down in areas for food and water getting in. The stores
[25:40.320 --> 25:45.960]  are empty in many cases and people began demonstrating and had some small riots over the fact that
[25:45.960 --> 25:50.840]  there's running out of food and water. And there's video of the riot police marching
[25:50.840 --> 25:56.440]  off to go after them in Mexico City up on infowars.com. And that was about 36 hours
[25:56.440 --> 26:03.280]  ago. That broke Friday night. So all of this is going on. So it's a man made crisis out
[26:03.280 --> 26:09.480]  of this hysteria and they're pulling people off planes who are sweating and have a fever.
[26:09.480 --> 26:13.960]  They are in the United States. They're in North Carolina, have checkpoints and if you're
[26:13.960 --> 26:17.760]  sick, you disappear. At the border, if you're sick as U.S. citizens, they drag you off to
[26:17.760 --> 26:23.120]  quarantine. They're quarantining hotels in Canada, the U.S., Europe, China. All of this
[26:23.120 --> 26:28.880]  fear mongering for something that's killed, the documented number is 12 people. They say
[26:28.880 --> 26:32.720]  it might have killed a couple hundred worldwide. There's a few thousand cases worldwide. This
[26:32.720 --> 26:42.040]  is ridiculous. But meanwhile, they're announcing to you the new rules. Okay Americans, okay
[26:42.040 --> 26:50.000]  Canadians, okay Australians. Australia is really fair mongering. We may have to lock
[26:50.000 --> 26:54.720]  down the cities. You may have to get 14 days supply of food and water. We may lock down
[26:54.720 --> 27:02.160]  buildings. They've already done that. Towns, counties, cities, states and forcibly inoculate
[27:02.160 --> 27:05.360]  you and they're telling you the executive orders of the news and you're going to have
[27:05.360 --> 27:11.320]  to lose your rights under martial law. That term is being used on Fox and CBS and CNN.
[27:11.320 --> 27:18.440]  We've got all the clips. I'll play one later. All of this is going on. All of this is happening
[27:18.440 --> 27:23.080]  for nothing. It's a scythe. And they said this, we think this flu has made mutate in
[27:23.080 --> 27:27.800]  the fall. So you better take your forced inoculation in. So this is kind of a primer. And then
[27:27.800 --> 27:32.560]  we also noticed they had unprecedented FEMA drills all over the United States from Austin,
[27:32.560 --> 27:37.640]  Texas to New York City just everywhere of forced inoculations at schools from Alaska
[27:37.640 --> 27:43.240]  to Dallas, Texas. Drills of forced inoculations. You just Google inoculation drill that were
[27:43.240 --> 27:49.600]  scheduled months ago for this last week and next week so people would comply and be part
[27:49.600 --> 27:56.200]  of it. They've had drills everywhere. They've had mass FEMA camp drills and mass grave drills
[27:56.200 --> 28:00.120]  and they've been calling. We've documented and linked up the mainstream news articles
[28:00.120 --> 28:06.160]  and the internal documents. Mass graves confirmed info wars.com. Just Google that will come
[28:06.160 --> 28:09.760]  up because we have a data page for all the mainstream links. Rocky Mountain News admitting
[28:09.760 --> 28:14.720]  mobile incinerators, mass graves being prepared. All of this for months and months and months
[28:14.720 --> 28:21.920]  and months before this at a level of activity we've never seen before because they decided
[28:21.920 --> 28:27.360]  to just hype some man made virus that no doubt some government lab or private lab put out
[28:27.360 --> 28:31.400]  so they can now hype that they've got the vaccine in the fall and then reintroduce something
[28:31.400 --> 28:34.880]  new or maybe they know it's going to mutate. We don't know, but I'm telling you this has
[28:34.880 --> 28:39.840]  got all the hallmarks of a total operation and there's no doubt that viruses manufactured
[28:39.840 --> 28:45.600]  period. So am I ranting? Yes. I'm upset about this because I've been telling you for years.
[28:45.600 --> 28:49.760]  I believe their next move will be a staged bio weapons release and I said on record
[28:49.760 --> 28:55.720]  I know these people they'll have some false flag false start beta test first to practice
[28:55.720 --> 29:01.280]  their federal takeovers. And most of the political scientists say that by next fall next winter
[29:01.280 --> 29:06.080]  definitely by next summer, maybe even this summer. They're already happening in Europe
[29:06.080 --> 29:11.280]  Eastern Europe Asia riots over the collapsing economy over the police state all this and
[29:11.280 --> 29:14.080]  then every time you try to go out and take over your government take your government
[29:14.080 --> 29:21.040]  back they'll release a bio weapon or a bio sim. That's what this clearly is and lock everything
[29:21.040 --> 29:25.800]  down in the name of keeping everybody safe. Okay. Now we come back I'm going to take phone
[29:25.800 --> 29:30.640]  calls but next hour I'm going to let you know about the latest gun grab and this is serious

[34:07.120 --> 34:13.920]  It states that civilian ownership of firearms will be completely curtailed for a power monopoly
[34:13.920 --> 34:20.400]  of the state. Power monopoly of the state's a nice way to say dick-tator ship. That's the criminal
[34:20.400 --> 34:24.800]  UN bought and paid for by the big banks. Openly setting up a new bank of the world you'll pay
[34:24.800 --> 34:31.280]  your carbon taxes to. It'll be just like China is today or Nazi Germany was or Soviet Russia.
[34:31.280 --> 34:36.640]  When you're disarmed the government can suck everything it wants off of you while the offshore
[34:36.640 --> 34:42.160]  banks sit outside the tyrannical nations and play them off against each other. And yes,
[34:42.160 --> 34:53.600]  it's 112 co-sponsors so far on record at thomas.gov title to amend title 31 United States code to
[34:53.600 --> 34:58.000]  reform the manner in which the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is audited by the
[34:58.000 --> 35:02.080]  Comptroller General of the United States and the manner in which such audits are reported
[35:02.080 --> 35:09.120]  and for other purposes. And that's written by Ron Paul. Comrade Ron Paul now has 112 sponsors
[35:09.120 --> 35:13.840]  up from 80 something a couple of weeks ago. He had 87 sponsors when he was on the show a week
[35:13.840 --> 35:21.680]  and a half ago. Just absolutely amazing to have that going on and happening. And back in the 80s
[35:21.680 --> 35:25.280]  it was a big fracas. And Ron Paul talked about this a few weeks ago on the show about auditing
[35:25.280 --> 35:30.800]  the Fed. So the the Fed did a trick. They passed a law saying audit it that said it was illegal
[35:30.800 --> 35:37.040]  to audit it. And the only audit could be of office supplies. So the pencils and chairs not what the
[35:37.040 --> 35:42.240]  money does. And so now congressmen during these hearings will ask the private Fed head Bernanke
[35:42.240 --> 35:47.520]  who's stolen 12.8 trillion so far going to Bloomberg and AP to give it to offshore private banks
[35:47.520 --> 35:52.160]  that you pay your taxes to the IRS. That's where the money goes directly. As Reagan said not one
[35:52.160 --> 35:56.480]  red senator tax money and of income tax goes around the nation. It's all the other taxes that
[35:56.480 --> 36:00.880]  do literally goes these private bankers in in Bernanke says I won't answer the question. I won't
[36:00.880 --> 36:05.920]  say where the money is. I don't have to. In fact, folks don't believe that. Let's play this again
[36:05.920 --> 36:11.360]  later. Google on YouTube for me Alan Greenspan says Fed above the law from where news hour.
[36:11.360 --> 36:15.440]  Well, we're going to play that later. But I promise I'm going your calls for the rest of the hour
[36:15.440 --> 36:22.160]  or next hour. I'm going to get into the gun ban treaty ban reloading ban changing anything on
[36:22.160 --> 36:28.720]  your gun ban the sale of many types of firearms and it'll all be under you and control. See,
[36:28.720 --> 36:32.800]  that's a blank check approach where they just just like under NAFTA and get the World Trade
[36:32.800 --> 36:37.440]  Organization controls all US trade issues now. Congress signed away its authority. Well, that's
[36:37.440 --> 36:44.320]  what this does. And Obama has said that he wants this. So remember this is a guy who when he was
[36:44.320 --> 36:51.120]  in the Senate of the state of Illinois wrote bills for the complete gun ban statewide. They want
[36:51.120 --> 36:55.920]  a Chicago style gun ban. Then his attorney general argued last year in the DC gun ban case before
[36:55.920 --> 37:00.240]  the Supreme Court. He's such a gun grabber. He was the lawyer arguing against the Second Amendment.
[37:00.240 --> 37:06.400]  He said, I agree with total gun ban of the citizen's only police and military should own any firearms,
[37:06.400 --> 37:12.160]  black powder, single shot. They don't care. Now they rule America and these are parasites for foreign
[37:12.160 --> 37:16.320]  banks. And when you're militarily dominated and financially dominated, you're not allowed to be
[37:16.320 --> 37:21.600]  armed. And getting your guns is the last step. You will be fully and I will be fully dominated
[37:21.600 --> 37:25.680]  by offshore private crime syndicates. It's very simple. So we'll be going over that right now.
[37:25.680 --> 37:29.680]  Let's go to Jason in Ohio. I'm going to go to these calls quickly. So make your points,
[37:29.680 --> 37:33.840]  please. Glad you're calling, but I want to move quicker. Jason in Ohio, you're on the air.
[37:35.040 --> 37:36.160]  Hello. Hi.
[37:36.160 --> 37:43.120]  I was going to talk about some of the like the teenagers and stuff like that, how they're taking
[37:43.120 --> 37:49.120]  an effort to bring the message into their high schools. What the message of liberty and freedom
[37:49.120 --> 37:56.240]  or the message of slavery? No, of the truth. Good. Yeah, I'm trying to compile a massive report
[37:56.880 --> 38:02.560]  about, you know, the truth movement, you know, everything you mentioned. And I want, I'm trying
[38:02.560 --> 38:07.520]  to go into, you know, go in front of the teachers and go in front of the class and start speaking
[38:07.520 --> 38:11.440]  about this too. Yes, because these are according to federal documents. We've covered it in Osium,
[38:11.440 --> 38:16.000]  and we sell the book, Deliberate Dumbing Down of America by the number two person of the Department
[38:16.000 --> 38:23.120]  of Education, Charlotte, Israel, where they openly say their job is to dumb down and stupefy the
[38:23.120 --> 38:28.160]  public where they have no basic understanding of anything history, nothing in these government
[38:28.160 --> 38:34.800]  training camps. The federal testing is to make sure the dumbing down is working. And it is. And so
[38:35.440 --> 38:40.880]  use these camps against them. Fight back in the gulag, where they have the cameras and the
[38:40.880 --> 38:47.360]  surveillance and the brainwashing. Fight back and educate inside the government indoctrination camp.
[38:48.000 --> 38:53.760]  Exactly, exactly. I have that book, actually. I haven't read all of it yet, but I am trying to
[38:53.760 --> 38:57.600]  like look through different books. Well, it's the size of a, it's the size of a phone book. It's
[38:57.600 --> 39:04.320]  mainly government documents. How they scientifically annihilate young minds. Mm-hmm. Yep. And that was
[39:04.320 --> 39:11.920]  what I gave this, the Obama deception. I gave the disc to Congressman Tim Ryan. Yes. For 17th
[39:11.920 --> 39:18.080]  District. Well, how? Yeah, I gave it to him and, you know, I'm hoping he looks at that. That was
[39:18.080 --> 39:24.000]  a great video, by the way. Well, good job, Jason. What do you think of the swine flu? And that,
[39:24.000 --> 39:29.280]  of course, name is a lie. The designer laboratory flu that they've been fair mongering about that
[39:30.000 --> 39:37.120]  appears to be as dangerous as a paper cut. You know, I heard about it, I think, before you
[39:37.120 --> 39:42.480]  mentioned it or something like that. And, you know, I know it was a man-made virus. Well,
[39:42.480 --> 39:47.040]  notice how it's tailored to be completely engineered. And now the scientists are admitting
[39:47.040 --> 39:54.400]  that's what freaked him out. Is this sucker has ever before been seen? Yeah. Much as he. Hey,
[39:54.400 --> 39:58.000]  listen, I got a jump. It's good to hear from you. I appreciate it. Chris in Florida. Chris,
[39:58.000 --> 40:03.520]  you're on the air. It's totally amazing that after a hundred days, which might be coincidental
[40:03.520 --> 40:08.160]  into the recent events of the bird flu that are great leaders so calm during the crisis.
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.720]  Well, absolutely. And it's interesting. You know, it doesn't deflect at all. I don't think because
[40:14.720 --> 40:20.640]  from the president, because sir, are you angry at chairman Obama? No, I'm not. You know, you know,
[40:20.640 --> 40:24.640]  he has a little blue book. His people literally they have a little Obama book that looks just
[40:24.640 --> 40:31.920]  like the Mauan, but it's blue. It's not red. Oh, and by the way, we've confirmed the Obama
[40:31.920 --> 40:36.560]  acorn people with billions of dollars of U.S. funding go around the people's doors,
[40:36.560 --> 40:41.520]  knocking on them, seeing if you support Obama and then they GPS your house and mark down whether
[40:41.520 --> 40:46.400]  you're a supporter or not. His own private army marking us soon will be yelling, uh, wearing
[40:46.400 --> 40:52.240]  yellow stars if he doesn't like us. Well, I was amazed to hear on my local community station,
[40:52.240 --> 40:58.480]  community sponsored station, WMNF.org today. So many of the former Obama support apologists
[40:58.480 --> 41:04.320]  were calling in that I was expecting to continue apologizing because the subject was the first
[41:04.320 --> 41:10.320]  hundred days. And I could I would credit you mainly with them saying that Obama is a frontman for
[41:10.320 --> 41:15.040]  the quote, new world order and quote. And I just kind of I don't use those words very often when
[41:15.040 --> 41:20.480]  I call in and there are two very few other colors of like mine. And so suddenly you're hearing the
[41:20.480 --> 41:24.640]  very points we make here over and over again from the Obama deception. Number one on the web,
[41:24.640 --> 41:29.760]  five weeks running. Very exciting. We are breaking the paradigm and I am really asking for him to
[41:29.760 --> 41:35.360]  crush me, but I'm too committed to this now to care and I am again in through and beyond.
[41:35.360 --> 41:39.520]  That's exciting to hear. I'm worried about these other community sponsored stations around the
[41:39.520 --> 41:43.760]  country. I've heard of them victims of arson in the past and I heard. Wow.
[41:49.600 --> 41:57.920]  Okay, let's go ahead and take a call from Robert in Texas. Robert in Texas, you're on the air.
[41:58.720 --> 42:02.720]  The legendary Alex Jones. How are you doing? Good sir. Good to talk to you. The legendary
[42:02.720 --> 42:07.280]  Robert from Texas. Oh, hey, you know, whatever. Hey, we are all legend. We're living on an awesome
[42:07.280 --> 42:13.200]  planet with weird green trees growing and big crystal clear lakes and stars at night and clouds
[42:13.200 --> 42:18.720]  and crazy guys worshiping owls and crazy guys in Bohemian Grove Christian conservatives having
[42:18.720 --> 42:24.560]  homosexual orgies. Yes, it's very bizarre. Yeah, well, I mentioned I was in New Brompsville the
[42:24.560 --> 42:29.600]  day after that email came out about basically doing the fear mongering about the quote unquote
[42:29.600 --> 42:34.720]  swine flu and the day after that morning I was unloading. I mean, I was actually loading my
[42:34.720 --> 42:40.800]  car because I had to go to work and I went up front door and I looked back while I was loading
[42:40.800 --> 42:44.960]  my car up and I didn't see anybody before but when I looked back towards this lady standing
[42:44.960 --> 42:49.680]  there with the GPS thing and a little US Census bag. No, no, no, it's confirmed what they've done
[42:49.680 --> 42:53.360]  is they've hired acorn people and others with two billion bucks. This is admitted with the
[42:53.360 --> 42:58.640]  stimulus money. Another group that got three billion and they're going around GPSing whether
[42:58.640 --> 43:02.880]  or not you support Obama. Yeah, and it was I just think it's weird because what did you say to
[43:02.880 --> 43:07.920]  this scumbag? Yeah, there was an article that you had that said there's some kind of coinciding
[43:08.560 --> 43:13.360]  pattern with the swine flu word out where it breaks out and then whether doing the GPS.
[43:13.360 --> 43:17.280]  I mean, what did you say to this little stasi? What did you say to this Nazi, this
[43:17.280 --> 43:23.200]  shy com, this imperial guard, this thug, this traitor to freedom, this dirty government agent,
[43:23.200 --> 43:28.480]  this piece of filth, this un-American piece of trash, everything that's bad about the planet?
[43:28.480 --> 43:33.600]  What did you say this little minion of evil? Stay there, we'll come back to you.

[47:42.800 --> 47:58.240]  Okay, Robert, you had a member of our new Secret Police, the new Million Person, until U.S.
[47:58.240 --> 48:03.040]  Senators announced the New York Times. It's going to be seven million domestic spies,
[48:03.040 --> 48:06.000]  but they're going to be paid by the government. That's the new government welfare program they
[48:06.000 --> 48:11.040]  take from the working middle class and they give it to people that can't get jobs or don't want to
[48:11.040 --> 48:16.080]  work, and then they come out and command and rule us. Maybe they can have little whipping sticks,
[48:16.080 --> 48:21.360]  little cattle prods, and we can start making bricks for them or something and build pyramids
[48:21.360 --> 48:25.200]  for the bureaucrats, and we'll build giant Sphinx heads of the presidents.
[48:25.200 --> 48:29.360]  But so what did you say to the creature that was GPSing your home?
[48:31.600 --> 48:35.680]  She took me completely by surprise because I turned around and she just appeared like a little
[48:35.680 --> 48:41.360]  vampire or a little sneaky little creepy person just creeped up there, and I was like, well,
[48:41.920 --> 48:44.640]  what are you doing? Because she didn't knock on the door at all. That's what kind of creeping
[48:44.640 --> 48:46.400]  out. She didn't knock on the door. She didn't talk to anybody.
[48:46.400 --> 48:50.880]  Got to be clear, they go, though, to the doorstep because they want your doorstep. Where does
[48:50.880 --> 48:57.200]  someone slot in? That is for federal. This is admitted. Listen, folks, guess what zip codes are?
[48:57.840 --> 49:02.880]  Zip codes are artillery coordinates, and folks are going, well, how with five numbers do you do
[49:02.880 --> 49:08.880]  artillery? Now, the dash on the next number was before GPS. They can bring down on your house
[49:08.880 --> 49:15.360]  artillery or bombs with that. That is a Pentagon grid. Now, with the GPS developed by the military
[49:15.360 --> 49:20.720]  that was originally for smart bombs and cruise missiles, they admit this is for gun confiscation
[49:20.720 --> 49:26.400]  and control, and the feds are going to every doorstep in America, but they also have separately the
[49:26.400 --> 49:31.680]  Acorn people out identifying. They admit this. Are you an Obama supporter or are you not an
[49:31.680 --> 49:36.560]  Obama supporter? They want to know, and so they can send those federal SWAT teams right to your
[49:36.560 --> 49:40.640]  door. Isn't that land of the free home of the brave, baby? Just like we told you about the
[49:40.640 --> 49:45.360]  federal reports and we broke the Mayak and the Homeland Security reports telling you the veterans
[49:45.360 --> 49:49.360]  of the terrorists and the gun owners of the terrorists and the families and the Americans
[49:49.360 --> 49:54.080]  and the Christians of the terrorists. And because we're the people that don't want communism in
[49:54.080 --> 50:00.560]  America, but it's not the communism that we were taught about. It's big fat degenerate offshore
[50:00.560 --> 50:06.000]  banks saying, this is commie land. We're going to turn a bunch of lazy parasites loose on you.
[50:06.000 --> 50:09.680]  They're going to steal all the money. We're going to give them a little bit because they like shiny
[50:09.680 --> 50:14.800]  uniforms and the offshore banks are going to take it. How's that sound? Anyway, so you find this
[50:14.800 --> 50:19.040]  little vampire at your doorstep. And by the way, they're crossing people's fences. They're coming
[50:19.040 --> 50:23.840]  across no trespassing signs. This is all over the news coming to your doorstep because they want to
[50:23.840 --> 50:29.280]  know where to send those federal SWAT teams, baby. Now, tell me. You're going to love this.
[50:29.280 --> 50:33.280]  Well, I asked her and she said, well, I'm with the census. And I said, well, what are you doing
[50:33.280 --> 50:38.880]  there on my doorstep? And she said, well, we count people. And I just didn't know how to respond
[50:38.880 --> 50:43.040]  to that. You know, I was like, just so condescending, you know, but we count people.
[50:43.040 --> 50:48.080]  So did you ask the worm? Did you ask the worm why they were there with GPS?
[50:49.200 --> 50:56.240]  Yeah, she would say, well, she admitted that it was a GPS thing. And then she took off and my
[50:56.240 --> 50:59.680]  girlfriend was inside the house, but I got her so she could see her walking off. And, you know,
[50:59.680 --> 51:03.280]  she had a little camouflage hat on and she went to the neighbor's house, stood on their porch,
[51:03.280 --> 51:08.000]  didn't talk on their door, didn't talk to anybody. No, they're coming. They're coming to find where
[51:08.000 --> 51:12.400]  to send the SWAT team. Yeah, exactly. We need video of this. I mean, it's in the news they're
[51:12.400 --> 51:17.840]  doing and they're coming across people's land. You name it. Remember in 2000, the cases where
[51:17.840 --> 51:24.160]  they would break down doors. I've got Google it right now. Census taker forces way into home.
[51:24.160 --> 51:28.000]  Google it. You think I'm joking? I don't joke about nothing, folks. It's all documented. Now,
[51:28.000 --> 51:32.560]  listen, I don't understand. I don't understand what your deal is. You know, I'm kind of looking
[51:32.560 --> 51:38.720]  forward to building our old temples for these guys, you know, you're kind of looking forward to
[51:38.720 --> 51:44.560]  taking that vaccine that sterilizes you, then you're never mind. I'm not going to say it.
[51:46.480 --> 51:50.720]  They got shots, folks, that basically terminate any usefulness for your WAVOs.
[51:50.720 --> 51:55.280]  I thought to just take your vaccine, ladies and gentlemen, adios mofo.
[51:56.720 --> 52:01.200]  You guys are in there playing some funny clips today. Okay, you know what? I joke about this,
[52:01.200 --> 52:07.600]  but I'm not joking. I joke around, but this is a serious issue. Now, let me tell you,
[52:07.600 --> 52:11.440]  I'm not saying all census takers are bad or evil. They're folks wanting 10 bucks an hour,
[52:11.440 --> 52:20.000]  but I remember in 2000, I was covering it on the air at the time and one out of six households
[52:20.000 --> 52:24.480]  got this longer form that had 49 questions. And then I think it was one out of 15. I don't remember
[52:24.480 --> 52:29.120]  the exact. Got this American Community Survey. It was a couple hundred long and people were
[52:29.120 --> 52:34.160]  getting business surveys. They were asking, how many guns do you have? What are your stocks and
[52:34.160 --> 52:41.360]  bonds? List them. You know, do you have a low flush toilet? How long have you lived here?
[52:41.360 --> 52:47.440]  You know, who is your next of kin? And I explained to people that the U.S. Code, and I had retired
[52:47.440 --> 52:51.600]  judges on and read the U.S. Code, all they can ask you is how many people live here? That's it.
[52:52.560 --> 52:57.680]  Not their blood type, not who their mommy was, not if they like to drink 2% or whole milk.
[52:57.680 --> 53:02.000]  You can't ask them if their hair is dyed. You can't ask them, you know, if they use
[53:02.560 --> 53:06.320]  conditioner when they wash their hair. You can't ask them if they clean their toenails.
[53:06.320 --> 53:10.320]  You can't ask them their sexual preference. You can't ask them if they like slits, malt,
[53:10.320 --> 53:14.160]  liquor, or Budweiser. You can't ask them if you like the Cowboys and the Redskins.
[53:14.160 --> 53:17.680]  You can't ask them nothing, you little secret police freaks. Now,
[53:20.240 --> 53:23.360]  all of that said, I'm getting tired of tyranny, folks. I'm fired up today.
[53:24.480 --> 53:28.800]  This is what happens when I stop not exercising, start exercising. The old
[53:28.800 --> 53:32.080]  Harrod Alex of 10, 12 years ago comes back, the really obnoxious one.
[53:32.880 --> 53:36.800]  Anyways, testosterone is what it's called, folks. Can make all my hair fall out though,
[53:36.800 --> 53:46.800]  but I keep working out like this. Anyways, side issue. Oh, yeah, working out with heavy
[53:46.800 --> 53:50.560]  weights, boosters, testosterone, folks. I'm fired up here. All right, let me go, plus all this
[53:50.560 --> 53:54.000]  coffee I've been drinking. But listen, let's just go back here. Doesn't it fire you up?
[53:55.200 --> 54:01.280]  I mean, to know that under the census law, they can only ask how people live here, and that's for,
[54:01.280 --> 54:07.840]  that goes back to Mount Sinai and Moses numbering the people of Israel to break them into tribes.
[54:09.520 --> 54:13.360]  What you're dealing with here is they said, we're going to have a Congress,
[54:14.080 --> 54:18.800]  and each state will get two senators, but so that states with bigger populations don't get full
[54:18.800 --> 54:24.160]  control. We'll have senators, but at the same time, so bigger states do get a little bit more
[54:24.160 --> 54:29.840]  representation. In the house, it'll be a portion by the number of people by the census,
[54:29.840 --> 54:35.200]  how many representatives you get. And under US law, they can only ask how many people live here.
[54:35.200 --> 54:40.160]  That's it. So when you get the form, the longer ones that we got in 2000, and now it's time for
[54:40.160 --> 54:46.720]  the census again, has totally illegal. It's all color of law. It's a trick. Just like there's no
[54:46.720 --> 54:52.640]  law, you got to take vaccines. It's a regulation to attend school, but it's not a law. It's their
[54:52.640 --> 54:57.920]  policy, but they have to give you a waiver for the policy under state law. Well, it's the same
[54:57.920 --> 55:02.400]  thing. You'll see the big forum with 49 questions, 100 questions, 200 questions. It depends. They
[55:02.400 --> 55:06.240]  send out different ones, and it'll say, up in the corner, it'll have two or three questions,
[55:06.800 --> 55:12.960]  and it'll say under that, you have to do this by penalty of law. And then there's a tiny dotted
[55:12.960 --> 55:16.720]  line beneath it with all the other questions that under law, you don't have to answer.
[55:16.720 --> 55:20.960]  But they don't explain that to you. You see how that scam works? It's a contract fraud.
[55:20.960 --> 55:26.160]  Stinking dirty lion government lawyers think up all this stuff to trick you, and they sit around
[55:26.160 --> 55:29.920]  laughing. The slaves will never know. They'll tell us how much money they've got in the bank.
[55:29.920 --> 55:34.800]  Do they own firearms? And then I remember there was a big stink in 2000 about this,
[55:34.800 --> 55:38.400]  and I got bang, bang, bang. And my girlfriend, now my wife,
[55:40.560 --> 55:44.400]  had answered the door when I was gone one day, and this punk at the door threatened her and said,
[55:44.400 --> 55:48.480]  you didn't fill out your census. You only said two people live here. You got to answer all the
[55:48.480 --> 55:53.600]  questions, and she slammed the door. Well, he was back. And so I get a video camera and I go to
[55:53.600 --> 55:57.680]  the door, this tape somewhere, and I say, what do you want? And he goes, he was an arrogant on a
[55:57.680 --> 56:00.960]  power trip. I walked outside and followed him. He was parked in the middle of the street,
[56:00.960 --> 56:05.040]  just totally out of his mind on a power trip. That's how it is. These dumb down fluoride heads,
[56:05.040 --> 56:10.400]  they got 75 IQs, but they're on a power trip with a little plastic badge now. And he says,
[56:10.400 --> 56:15.120]  you got to fill this out under law. And I said, go call the police then, punk. Get off my doorstep
[56:15.120 --> 56:19.520]  now. And he said, you're going to be arrested. I said, good, I'm going to sue you after I'm done.
[56:19.520 --> 56:26.000]  Get out of here. I followed him out to the curb because he, I'm somebody who's not a slave.
[56:26.000 --> 56:30.320]  I went and checked the US code. I know it's a lie. Now that idiot probably believes it's actually
[56:30.320 --> 56:35.040]  the law. Did you guys find where census takers forced ways into homes? You didn't find it.
[56:35.600 --> 56:38.560]  Still looking. No, I mean, it was all over the news. Of course, that was nine years ago,
[56:38.560 --> 56:41.600]  maybe off the web by now. Everybody remembers the point is that there were cases where they
[56:41.600 --> 56:45.680]  got on such power trips, they would force their way, bust down doors, they'd get arrested. One
[56:45.680 --> 56:53.440]  census taker got killed by dogs. Anyway, side issue. The point is, then they announced 2004,
[56:53.440 --> 56:57.280]  I remember seeing the news. Oh, now we're going to have yearly and monthly censuses. Now,
[56:57.280 --> 57:01.680]  no, wait a minute, you have a fifth amendment. They can catch an axe murderer with 15 chopped up
[57:02.240 --> 57:07.200]  men, women and children in a basement and they can't compel the axe murder to incriminate themselves.
[57:07.200 --> 57:13.520]  Fifth amendment, you have a right to remain silent. Why then do they tell you under penalty of law?
[57:13.520 --> 57:17.920]  You've got to answer these questions about it. Do you own guns? Do you have a low flush toilet?
[57:17.920 --> 57:20.000]  What are your stocks and bonds? Those are real questions.
[57:22.080 --> 57:27.360]  You see, this is how these scumbag work. Now they're going around GPSing everybody's front
[57:27.360 --> 57:31.680]  door for the federal police. You saw the gun confiscation in New Orleans and now in Illinois.
[57:33.360 --> 57:36.400]  So this has got me fired up and I'm sorry, I kind of went over the deep end there,
[57:36.400 --> 57:40.640]  but I mean, I am sick and tired of it. And then now we've confirmed the acorn people and others
[57:40.640 --> 57:45.920]  are running around with GPS's also marking. And of course, they admitted this about a month ago.
[57:45.920 --> 57:50.960]  They said, Oh, there'll be upwards of a million Obama volunteers knocking on your door to see
[57:50.960 --> 57:56.320]  if you support his agenda. And then I saw on their own blurbs, they've been given GPS's for files
[57:56.320 --> 58:02.640]  on top of it to nexus in with your name off the federal census. So both the feds and this auxiliary
[58:02.640 --> 58:06.880]  goon force, you know, when you see these USA service.org and all these groups, that's private
[58:06.880 --> 58:11.840]  groups, the Democratic Party and George Soros with Obama's face on it with the presidential seal
[58:11.840 --> 58:18.640]  building up a literal Hitler, you can write a Maoist system here in America. They will come
[58:18.640 --> 58:24.560]  back your calls and then the gun grabber treaty. I'm fired up. Stay with us, baby. It's no secret

[1:00:38.080 --> 1:00:44.800]  I am in USA Radio News. I'm Jody Jordan. A conservative icon has died. Jack Kemp,
[1:00:44.800 --> 1:00:50.720]  the former pro quarterback who turned fame on the gridiron into a career into national politics,
[1:00:50.720 --> 1:00:56.240]  died of cancer last evening at his suburban Washington home. The former congressman
[1:00:56.240 --> 1:01:03.280]  and 1996 Republican vice presidential candidate was 73. Edwin Fulner was a campaign advisor.
[1:01:03.280 --> 1:01:09.600]  He believed very much in freedom for everybody and that everybody should have that equal opportunity.
[1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:13.040]  Not necessarily equal outcomes, but they all should have the opportunity.
[1:01:13.040 --> 1:01:19.120]  And the majority of swine flu cases in Spain are due to visits in Mexico. Here's Harold Heckel.
[1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:26.080]  All of the cases except for one are actually people that have returned from holidaying in
[1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:33.440]  Mexico. Only one has been an infection within Spanish soil. This is IRN USA Radio News.

[1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:39.840]  Negotiations are restarting today between unions at the Boston Globe and its owner,
[1:02:39.840 --> 1:02:44.800]  the New York Times Company, as another deadline approaches for the Globe employees to make
[1:02:44.800 --> 1:02:50.000]  20 million in concessions. The Times Company has threatened to close the Globe unless the
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:56.320]  concessions are met. Chinese state media says an explosion in an illegal fireworks factory
[1:02:56.320 --> 1:03:02.240]  has killed 13 people and injured two. Yesterday's blasts flattened three rooms in a rented house

[1:04:09.520 --> 1:04:15.520]  to Christians there and also promote peace and reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians.
[1:04:15.520 --> 1:04:22.080]  This Friday I leave for my pilgrimage to the Holy Land where men and women first heard the voice
[1:04:22.080 --> 1:04:27.280]  of the Good Shepherd. Benedict will travel to Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories
[1:04:27.280 --> 1:04:33.440]  May 8th through the 15th. He spoke about his trip during his weekly Sunday blessings to pilgrims
[1:04:33.440 --> 1:04:39.440]  and tourists in St. Peter's Square. Children are among the latest victims of a bomb attack in
[1:04:39.440 --> 1:04:46.000]  Afghanistan. Here's Jason Strasioso. An improvised bomb placed on a bicycle in a busy market in
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:51.920]  southern Afghanistan killed four people including two children, a 10-year-old boy and an 8-year-old
[1:04:51.920 --> 1:04:57.280]  girl. Such violence threatens to overshadow the August 20th election, the second since the
[1:04:57.280 --> 1:05:03.520]  ouster of the Taliban in 2001. A human rights committee official suspects potential voter fraud
[1:05:03.520 --> 1:05:16.800]  in the upcoming elections. In authorities in western Australia say they've recovered the
[1:05:16.800 --> 1:05:22.480]  bodies of six people who died when an avalanche struck as they hiked in the Alps yesterday.
[1:05:23.280 --> 1:05:27.680]  Six of the victims were from the Czech Republic. There was only one survivor.

[1:05:39.920 --> 1:05:44.880]  and degas your water supply from any source rendering chemicals harmless to the human body
[1:05:44.880 --> 1:05:50.080]  by polarizing the molecular structure. Imagine a softer, smoother water with increased oxygen
[1:05:50.080 --> 1:05:55.360]  that helps the nervous system in brain. There are no filters to buy and it can be taken anywhere
[1:05:55.360 --> 1:06:01.760]  making it our number one new product from hempusa.org. This water system will descale all piping,
[1:06:01.760 --> 1:06:06.960]  hot water heaters and appliances due to heavy buildup of hard minerals. Detoxification may result

[1:07:11.680 --> 1:07:17.120]  We are locked and loaded. This is the info war. You are on the tip of the spear of the fight for
[1:07:17.120 --> 1:07:21.360]  liberty and freedom against the globalists. We are breaking the mainstream media's conditioning,
[1:07:21.360 --> 1:07:26.000]  brainwashing or false left-right paradigm. We are taking action. Okay, next segment I'm getting
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:30.720]  into the gun grab treaty. All the latest gun grabbing. This is off the chart. Obama keeps
[1:07:30.720 --> 1:07:34.960]  using his military program of saying this is not an assault. We don't want your guns. This is not
[1:07:34.960 --> 1:07:40.720]  amnesty as they push for amnesty. This is not a carbon tax as it is a carbon tax. Using his
[1:07:40.720 --> 1:07:47.280]  move to go after our guns and everything else with the smoke screen of the hyped up manufactured
[1:07:47.280 --> 1:07:53.680]  flu known as the porcine piggly wiggly flu. Let's go ahead and take a call. Now listen,
[1:07:53.680 --> 1:07:57.520]  I'm going to do this because I'm really bad. Caller calls up, gets me on a rant and a rave
[1:07:57.520 --> 1:08:02.560]  about the census takers violating the law, color of law, intimidating people to, you know,
[1:08:02.560 --> 1:08:06.480]  turn into snitches on themselves and tell faceless bureaucrats all this stuff.
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:12.720]  In fact, we Googled census takers forced their way into door from 2000. We found a
[1:08:12.720 --> 1:08:17.920]  bunch of new stuff like this one. First video footage of census takers, taker and GPS in
[1:08:17.920 --> 1:08:22.480]  neighborhood. Worker gets upset with homeowner for videotape and then tells the guy, you can't
[1:08:22.480 --> 1:08:27.520]  videotape me in your own house. I mean, now it's not enough to have cops on a power trip violating
[1:08:27.520 --> 1:08:32.640]  the bill of rights. Now it's just millions of little, little mindless idiots who haven't even
[1:08:32.640 --> 1:08:37.280]  given 10 minutes of training about the bill of rights running around on power trips.
[1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:39.760]  Then it was, let's go ahead. I'm going to give each caller about a minute because I want to,
[1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:44.800]  I want to take seven calls in this segment and then come back and get into all of this vital news.
[1:08:45.840 --> 1:08:48.080]  Michael, you're on the air from Los Angeles. Go ahead.
[1:08:48.880 --> 1:08:51.440]  Yeah, this is the chemtrail capital of the world.
[1:08:52.480 --> 1:08:55.040]  But anyway, Alex, I just wanted to talk to you real quick about
[1:08:56.400 --> 1:09:03.120]  Mayor Anthony Beaver-Gosa. He's coming up with the LA County Sheriff's to do a,
[1:09:03.120 --> 1:09:10.560]  a basically a grab on Mother's Day. They're asking Los Angelinos to hand in their guns
[1:09:10.560 --> 1:09:15.680]  for groceries. Yeah, and they did this in, they did this in Canada, they do this in England,
[1:09:15.680 --> 1:09:19.360]  they did this in Australia. They just keep saying, hand in your guns for money, hand in
[1:09:19.360 --> 1:09:23.200]  your guns for money. And they show the images of people handing their guns in on the news.
[1:09:23.200 --> 1:09:28.800]  And the news implies guns are illegal. And that's always a prelude to real gun bands
[1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:37.280]  in Australia, in England, in Germany. And yes, what was it? $6 billion of the $787 billion
[1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:40.960]  is being given to local police departments for anti-gun programs.
[1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:44.960]  And the feds are having county and city governments, and this is treason, this
[1:09:44.960 --> 1:09:50.560]  follows a bunch of state and federal laws, go around state legislatures and pass gun bands
[1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:54.800]  on city by city basis. This is another way they're coming after our guns. Well,
[1:09:54.800 --> 1:09:58.960]  that stinking criminal president, and he is, it's high treason when he goes against the Bill
[1:09:58.960 --> 1:10:05.200]  of Rights. He sits up there saying that he is an anti-gun, at least be honest about it scumbag.
[1:10:06.080 --> 1:10:12.400]  Right, it's incredible. The mayor actually said, he's asking Angelinos to quote,
[1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:16.960]  turn in their guns. And this is all in an effort to get guns off the streets and quote,
[1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:21.120]  prevent gang violence. But you know, I don't see how. Oh, look at Mexico, highest crime rate in
[1:10:21.120 --> 1:10:25.680]  the world, highest crime rate in the world in Mexico, total gun ban. They want us to live
[1:10:25.680 --> 1:10:30.400]  like people do in Chicago and Mexico City and New York City, all the highest crime rates in the
[1:10:30.400 --> 1:10:35.440]  world, city by city, nation by nation, because they're disarmed and they always got thug corrupt
[1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:41.120]  politicians and military police ruling over them with criminals running wild. I'm sorry, go ahead.
[1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:46.640]  Well, I'm just going to ask all my friends to enter this action by going to their local gun
[1:10:46.640 --> 1:10:52.720]  shop on Mother's Day and producing a gun. Absolutely. Become free human beings, at least
[1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:56.160]  get a taser or some mace and start protecting yourself. These people train their daughters
[1:10:56.160 --> 1:10:59.840]  to be victims, send them off to college to be raped and killed. I've heard literally,
[1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:05.520]  and I appreciate your call, scores of phone calls, scores of phone calls from 911 where it's five,
[1:11:05.520 --> 1:11:09.280]  10, 15 minutes. And I'm not blaming the police. It's out there doing to protect you. You're
[1:11:09.280 --> 1:11:13.440]  actually read the law and they can't protect you every time. And they're going, he's busting in,
[1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:17.680]  he's coming to the window now. And this will go on for five minutes and then he's raping me up.
[1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:26.480]  How about he comes through? Boom, boom, boom, boom. You die. You like that? Yeah. I mean,
[1:11:26.480 --> 1:11:30.000]  I got two daughters. Let me tell you something. They're not going to lay around even if they
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  didn't have a gun. They're going with a butcher knife. They're going to attack you bastard. You
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:39.120]  got that? But now the cops show up the woman's raped and dead because though they were tied
[1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:44.480]  out to be feminists by the CIA run Miss Magazine, let's be classified to break up the family so
[1:11:44.480 --> 1:11:48.560]  the state could raise all the kids and the women would be working all the time. So they could have
[1:11:48.560 --> 1:11:53.200]  double taxes to break up the family and control it. Oh, it's so liberal. Oh, it's so good.
[1:11:57.120 --> 1:12:03.200]  I am fired up today, ladies and gentlemen now. And listen, I always say Obama's a puppet. I say
[1:12:03.200 --> 1:12:07.120]  Bush is a puppet. I try not to hate him individually. When I say scumbag criminals,
[1:12:07.120 --> 1:12:12.080]  Obama is just the titular head of that. He's the front man. And we need to not even get into hate
[1:12:12.080 --> 1:12:16.480]  of Obama, even though I catch myself doing it because he's just a front man. He's just a puppet.
[1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:20.880]  The globalist wanted us to hate Bush to hate him instead of ever hating the Federal Reserve,
[1:12:20.880 --> 1:12:24.320]  the bankers, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Queen of England, the New World Order,
[1:12:24.320 --> 1:12:28.960]  the known all this. But I mean, the scumbag criminals engaged in high treason coming after
[1:12:28.960 --> 1:12:33.200]  our, I mean, the federal government illegally that violates federal and state law, 10th Amendment,
[1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:39.440]  9th Amendment, state laws bypasses the state legislatures, which are moving towards pro-second
[1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:42.720]  amendment everywhere because the majority of people are waking up. They're moving to counties and
[1:12:42.720 --> 1:12:47.360]  cities and literally giving them federal money to pass laws against the second amendment. Now,
[1:12:47.360 --> 1:12:51.840]  that's hot treason. Everything our veterans fought and died for, everything land of the free,
[1:12:51.840 --> 1:12:56.720]  home of the brave is about, is under attack. And I'm sick of it. Let's talk to Tracy in Minnesota.
[1:12:56.720 --> 1:13:02.880]  You're on the air, Tracy. Hi, Alex. God bless you and your family for your work and them putting
[1:13:02.880 --> 1:13:07.040]  up with you. And I just love everything. Hey, I'm not a slave. Again, people get excited about
[1:13:07.040 --> 1:13:10.720]  sports. That's mental illness. They yell and scream. People say, oh, that's a good old boy.
[1:13:10.720 --> 1:13:14.480]  But you get excited about defending liberty, not having a bunch of bloodthirsty communists
[1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:19.200]  suck on your drive. You're some kind of weirdo. No, you haven't gilded me. I'm not your slave.
[1:13:19.200 --> 1:13:24.160]  I'm not under your control. I've broken your conditioning. Go ahead. No, your, your animation
[1:13:24.160 --> 1:13:28.720]  and your energy is just, you know what? It's gotten my eight year old's attention and he loves you.
[1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:33.600]  And it's getting information out there that I've just, I love you. I wanted to tell you about,
[1:13:33.600 --> 1:13:37.920]  we had a tax cut rally up here. Bob is going around with a pair of scissors wanting to chop
[1:13:37.920 --> 1:13:43.680]  everybody's things off and I'm not going along with it. No, I'm not yelled at. Go ahead, ma'am.
[1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:48.480]  No, no, no, no, I'm teaching my kids a lot. You're helping me teach my kids. Let's just say that.
[1:13:48.480 --> 1:13:54.400]  But no, we had a tax cut rally up here at the Capitol. And, you know, it's so funny because
[1:13:54.400 --> 1:13:58.720]  it just finally hit me and go, I got these tea parties, these fake tea parties, whatever you
[1:13:58.720 --> 1:14:03.600]  want to call them. Then you got the end the feds and, and then boom, they try to like hit us with,
[1:14:03.600 --> 1:14:08.480]  oh, stay inside, put the masks on. Marshall law is good. We've got to confiscate your firearms and
[1:14:08.480 --> 1:14:12.080]  give you more synoculations. Yeah, and then maybe just think. Here's the key point I haven't made.
[1:14:12.080 --> 1:14:15.920]  They leave, they say they're going to lock all the U.S. cities down, but the border and all the
[1:14:15.920 --> 1:14:20.880]  planes keep flying. We're going to lock down U.S. cities maybe and take your, make you take shots,
[1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:26.400]  but the border stays wide open. Right. And so right there you have, let's, I'm thinking now,
[1:14:26.400 --> 1:14:30.800]  oh, well, they're thinking, okay, shut down the city, shut down the protest. I mean, I mean,
[1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:35.200]  exactly, no, no, look, this is a beta test for when there's real rebellion against the private
[1:14:35.200 --> 1:14:38.400]  bankers, hijacking the nation and openly announced that they're going to use North
[1:14:38.400 --> 1:14:43.120]  Common, the army against us. They'll just release flu each time or say a new flu is out. And,
[1:14:43.120 --> 1:14:46.320]  you know, the squirrel dies or something, they'll lock the whole country down,
[1:14:46.320 --> 1:14:52.080]  we'll burn the Bill of Rights and Constitution. Everything's over. Right. Right. And we had about
[1:14:52.080 --> 1:14:56.720]  two or three days ago, we finally had our first case of the, you know, swine flu.
[1:15:00.240 --> 1:15:05.120]  I know, we're not scared. Two days later, 5,000 people show up at the state capital. It hit me,
[1:15:05.120 --> 1:15:10.000]  like, we're not scared. Exactly. God bless you. And that's the spirit. That is the spirit that
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:14.640]  will defeat the globalist. Time for one more now. Let's jam in one more. Matt in Houston
[1:15:14.640 --> 1:15:20.800]  in H town. You're on the air, baby. Hi, Alex. I'm a long time listener. First time caller.
[1:15:20.800 --> 1:15:29.680]  Have you broken your conditioning? Yes, sir. Done a week ago. And I've been preparing for a while.
[1:15:31.040 --> 1:15:35.200]  I've watched the Obama deception. I shared it with people that I work with. I'm hanging out on
[1:15:35.200 --> 1:15:41.760]  my flash drives. I have a DVD burner. I can burn up to 12 copies at a time. I'm very hyped up.
[1:15:41.760 --> 1:15:45.200]  I'm very excited. I'm not going to submit, not going to take the vaccination.
[1:15:46.640 --> 1:15:51.600]  Yeah, that's the spirit. I can feel it. I can feel the liberty. I like you.
[1:15:52.960 --> 1:16:00.240]  Sir, what I want to tell you about is breaking news from Canada. The Canadian food inspection
[1:16:00.240 --> 1:16:06.240]  agency shows that they've detected the swine flu in three months.
[1:16:06.240 --> 1:16:13.440]  Oh, I got upset in my pants. I heard the word bird flu. I'll hand it all my firearms now.
[1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:15.520]  Well, you're saying they found bird flu or the piggy flu?
[1:16:17.520 --> 1:16:22.080]  Porky pig? Porky pig is on the loose. Oh, porky pig.
[1:16:23.920 --> 1:16:29.680]  Lock the city down. Turn your guns in. Take force inoculations. Oh, my God, there's been one death.
[1:16:29.680 --> 1:16:33.200]  Oh, help me, please. Oh, God.
[1:16:33.200 --> 1:16:37.040]  Good day. Jim Newcomer from ITUS Resources, May 1, 2009.

[1:17:01.520 --> 1:17:05.280]  Bad news for US currency. China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[1:17:05.280 --> 1:17:08.640]  Dollars fall into 65% of euro. Erosion accelerates.
[1:17:08.640 --> 1:17:13.200]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of US loss of confidence, causing more selling.

[1:20:00.240 --> 1:20:05.200]  then invented the light bulb. George Washington rebelled against an entire country and led the

[1:20:59.600 --> 1:21:05.840]  There must be some kind of way out of here. I know this. Me and mine. We're not slaves.
[1:21:08.560 --> 1:21:14.800]  I'm not a slave. My family aren't slaves. I know slavery when I see it and a bunch of dirtbag
[1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:19.520]  corporatists coming in here with a bunch of fancy song and dance and looting the nation. It's
[1:21:19.520 --> 1:21:24.000]  stealing 12.8 trillion in the last six months. They're lying their dirtbag pockets and now
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:28.560]  they're menacing us with the military and obamanoids running around on the streets saying gun owners
[1:21:28.560 --> 1:21:33.520]  are the number one terror threat in America. You're the terrorist. You're bankers. You're criminals.
[1:21:34.560 --> 1:21:39.280]  All right. All right. I'm going to blitz through calls because coming up with the gun stuff next
[1:21:39.280 --> 1:21:42.160]  segment I promise, but I want to take more of your calls. Just these callers keep bringing up
[1:21:42.160 --> 1:21:46.480]  issues that fire me up to no end. And I guess it's wrong. You know, the founding fathers got
[1:21:46.480 --> 1:21:50.320]  fired up too about freedom. They were evil, I guess, according to the FEMA reports. I've got
[1:21:50.320 --> 1:21:54.160]  FEMA on tape saying the founding fathers were terrorists and bad. Maybe, maybe, maybe loving
[1:21:54.160 --> 1:21:58.640]  freedom and not wanting to be a slave and having red blood is bad. Unless you're yelling at a stupid
[1:21:58.640 --> 1:22:03.600]  sports game, then it's okay. That's allowed. That's all that is. He is like a little avenue to
[1:22:03.600 --> 1:22:08.720]  discharge all your real energy. You sit there like a spectator dressed up like a clown instead of
[1:22:08.720 --> 1:22:14.160]  really getting fired up in the game of life, which is war, war against tyranny. Tyranny's always
[1:22:14.160 --> 1:22:19.440]  waging war against liberty. You figure that out yet. There's a war going on for your mind and your
[1:22:19.440 --> 1:22:24.320]  wallet and your children and everything. You're going to stand up to it? John in Toronto, Canada,
[1:22:24.320 --> 1:22:32.000]  you're on the air worldwide, John. John, come ahead. Okay, John, just made the jump into hyperspace.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:37.520]  Let's talk to John from an undisclosed location from Planet Pop-Tart. You're on the air, John,
[1:22:37.520 --> 1:22:43.120]  go ahead. How's it going? Good, sir. First, let me just say I prefer to say undisclosed just because
[1:22:43.120 --> 1:22:47.200]  I don't believe in the man-made boundaries that we have drawn in the lines which have done nothing,
[1:22:47.200 --> 1:22:51.840]  but diminish our progress as humans are. Do you believe in a global government,
[1:22:51.840 --> 1:22:57.440]  great, with a big, fat, mousy tongue running at the top with machine guns? Let me just say to you
[1:22:57.440 --> 1:23:03.920]  this way. I would point in your direction by a very well-known member of InfoWars to put it
[1:23:03.920 --> 1:23:07.920]  to you simply to deal firearms for many years, and I'm sure you can piece it together and understand
[1:23:07.920 --> 1:23:13.920]  who I'm talking about. With this said... Riddle me this, riddle me that, and I don't know what
[1:23:13.920 --> 1:23:19.040]  you're just telling me, sir. What's going on? Nature's law. Alright, nature is always goes
[1:23:19.040 --> 1:23:25.040]  in hand with irony. What we're talking about is parasites, people that are feeding. Let's take
[1:23:25.040 --> 1:23:29.600]  the common flea, for example. What they do is they feed, but without that feeder they have nothing,
[1:23:29.600 --> 1:23:33.920]  no power, and we're talking about these people that are running the world at this point and
[1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:39.680]  controlling us. However, the only reason why they can do this is because we have allowed them
[1:23:39.680 --> 1:23:44.320]  to feed off of us. And we follow their orders, and we do what they say, and they've turned
[1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:48.240]  our jobs and our schools and everything into prisons. I agree with you, Riddle point.
[1:23:48.240 --> 1:23:53.760]  And the time that we can get this to turn is, and perfect point that previous caller called
[1:23:53.760 --> 1:23:58.240]  an ambulance, a census taker, they all came to his yard. Why is that guy, the only guy sitting
[1:23:58.240 --> 1:24:02.000]  there arguing with them? How many neighbors did he have looking out their blinds going,
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:07.440]  oh my god, what's going on? That guy fought as one. Now, this is what needs to change,
[1:24:07.440 --> 1:24:12.800]  because the way I see it is when that consensus guy comes and forces himself on that property,
[1:24:12.800 --> 1:24:15.680]  it shouldn't be... Yeah, that's a giant question. That's a baby chick.
[1:24:15.680 --> 1:24:21.600]  It should be every neighbor in that neighborhood coming down. We're talking about 10 ponds versus
[1:24:21.600 --> 1:24:27.520]  one king. I hear you, people got to take action. That was a baby chick coming out to scout blood
[1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:31.840]  meals for the larger megatechs. And they're violating your Fifth Amendment, folks. But
[1:24:31.840 --> 1:24:35.200]  you violate your Fifth Amendment when you fill out an income tax form. We didn't have until 1913.
[1:24:35.200 --> 1:24:39.040]  You waive your rights. You violate your rights. They threaten you with penalties if you don't
[1:24:39.040 --> 1:24:43.520]  incriminate yourself and fill out these forms. The government says it's exempt from mistakes,
[1:24:43.520 --> 1:24:50.400]  but you're not exempt from mistakes. It goes on and on and on and on. And speak of the devil,
[1:24:51.200 --> 1:24:56.080]  they're trying to make school teachers and then real estate agents and then CPAs and then
[1:24:56.080 --> 1:24:59.360]  everybody, under Homeland Security, they're going to make everyone in the nation have a
[1:24:59.360 --> 1:25:05.920]  national ID card, locally standardized ID, to have a job. That's official. And they're phasing
[1:25:05.920 --> 1:25:10.720]  it in right now. So I got a news tip mail to me here at this station. And yes, I was aware of this,
[1:25:10.720 --> 1:25:14.720]  but I'm glad the person mailed to me. It says, America's privacy threatened by new global
[1:25:14.720 --> 1:25:20.080]  fingerprint database. CPA group allows foreign data minor full access to American fingerprints.
[1:25:20.080 --> 1:25:26.560]  See, not only are they making all the CPA people now fingerprint to have a CPA job,
[1:25:26.560 --> 1:25:31.120]  like you're a prisoner in a database, that's being shared internationally to track and trace you.
[1:25:31.120 --> 1:25:34.960]  And it's the same. They make you thumbprint to get school lunches in most schools. And even if
[1:25:34.960 --> 1:25:38.800]  you're paying for it yourself, this is the control grade to track and trace. So they just turn your
[1:25:38.800 --> 1:25:43.120]  thumbprint off. They admit that the government submit they're conditioning the public to do this
[1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:47.520]  to buy and sell. Whether you believe in revelations or not, this is a bad idea. Imagine if Hitler
[1:25:47.520 --> 1:25:51.920]  would have had this, nobody would have gotten away from it. Even the American Institute for
[1:25:51.920 --> 1:25:55.840]  Certified Public Accountants under pressure from outrage citizens and CPAs from across the
[1:25:55.840 --> 1:25:59.680]  country has recently admitted to collecting the fingerprints of American citizens who take the
[1:25:59.680 --> 1:26:05.040]  CPA exam. And it doesn't matter. It says people in a news article bring their social security card,
[1:26:05.040 --> 1:26:10.240]  driver's license, passport, everything. And they say, no, you must give us your biometric
[1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:15.280]  fingerprint. Now, see, I have this Lou Dobbs piece. Now, I reported this a couple of weeks ago about
[1:26:15.280 --> 1:26:21.360]  and so the governors of America about this new treaty to ban reloading, saying it's terrorism
[1:26:21.360 --> 1:26:27.040]  and explosives to reload in your home or private companies have to get a U.N. license, international
[1:26:27.040 --> 1:26:32.960]  license. It'll ban cleaning your guns, disassembling guns, changing barrels. It will restrict the
[1:26:32.960 --> 1:26:38.560]  shipping of guns outside the U.S. and guns into the United States. But people don't believe us,
[1:26:38.560 --> 1:26:43.600]  even when we link to the treaty. So I wanted to right now, before I come back and go to calls,
[1:26:43.600 --> 1:26:46.720]  maybe I can settle down if we play this, go ahead and get into this. We'll continue with
[1:26:46.720 --> 1:26:50.320]  calls after it. I'm going to play just a little bit of this. The whole clips linked up on info
[1:26:50.320 --> 1:26:56.800]  wars.com from YouTube right now. And you can go there and link through the treaty itself as well.
[1:26:56.800 --> 1:27:01.840]  Rights under assault, foreign access to U.S. gun registry. And they make you fingerprint to be a
[1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:07.360]  gun dealer. And then that goes in the U.N. database. In 2000, they signed a world treaty where all
[1:27:07.360 --> 1:27:14.480]  drivers license all IDs. All this stuff is a worldwide database set by the U.N. The U.N.
[1:27:14.480 --> 1:27:19.680]  is in control of the swine flu response. And they're bragging, oh, this is good for global
[1:27:19.680 --> 1:27:25.120]  government, a good test, as the nations follow their orders. And who owns the U.N.? The private
[1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:30.960]  bankers, who are openly setting up the bank of the world, who just stole your $12.8 trillion
[1:27:30.960 --> 1:27:37.040]  out of the U.S. alone, another $10 trillion out of other nations. Private banks tax you. Private
[1:27:37.040 --> 1:27:41.200]  banks have taken over. Here's Lou Dobbs. Well, you know what? Yeah, we'll start it now and come
[1:27:41.200 --> 1:27:46.080]  back in a minute. Here it is. A renewed effort tonight that could curtail our Second Amendment
[1:27:46.080 --> 1:27:52.240]  rights to keep and bear arms if President Obama has his way. He wants the Senate to ratify a
[1:27:52.240 --> 1:27:57.360]  little-known treaty that would create a national registry for guns. Under that treaty, other nations
[1:27:57.360 --> 1:28:02.800]  would be able to identify gun owners in the United States. Bill Tucker has our report.
[1:28:04.800 --> 1:28:10.320]  President Obama went to Mexico and brought back a 12-year-old treaty. I'm urging the Senate
[1:28:10.320 --> 1:28:17.360]  in the United States to ratify an inter-American treaty known as CIFTA to curb small arms trafficking
[1:28:17.360 --> 1:28:22.880]  that is a source of so many of the weapons used in this drug war. The treaty signed by President
[1:28:22.880 --> 1:28:29.200]  Clinton in 1997 was never ratified by the Senate. It calls for the institution of a regime of gun
[1:28:29.200 --> 1:28:34.560]  control never before seen in the United States, creating a gun registration system that would
[1:28:34.560 --> 1:28:40.000]  be open to international sharing. Offenders would be prosecuted under treaty law and they would
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:45.440]  be eligible for extradition. Proponents like Senator Dick Luger are urging passage saying,
[1:28:45.440 --> 1:28:50.960]  quote, we should consider ratifying this Congress. Think about the magnitude of that.
[1:28:52.240 --> 1:28:57.760]  Americans are now being extradited to Germany if they say the Holocaust didn't happen or that
[1:28:57.760 --> 1:29:03.920]  5,999,000 people were killed by Hitler. Hitler killed millions. He was a bad guy. I don't even
[1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:09.280]  disagree with that. Even if you think 10 million people were killed by Hitler, let's say a hundred
[1:29:09.280 --> 1:29:15.520]  million, whatever. It's your first amendment of free speech right to say that. But they set the
[1:29:15.520 --> 1:29:18.800]  precedent with that with these treaties. Well, you're not for Nazis, are you? And the next,
[1:29:18.800 --> 1:29:23.440]  it's, oh, you're denying global warming. They want, if you deny manmade climate change now,
[1:29:23.440 --> 1:29:27.520]  the European Union is trying to pass a law to arrest you. See? Oh, now, oh, you're for that.
[1:29:28.400 --> 1:29:32.720]  You see how this is happening? Oh, you violated a gun law in Germany. In the US, you're going to
[1:29:32.720 --> 1:29:38.400]  Germany. Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol
[1:29:38.400 --> 1:29:44.000]  levels may not be fully detected by you. But the symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood sugar,
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:49.280]  spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert

[1:29:54.720 --> 1:30:00.880]  of people's lives across America. My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.

[1:30:05.280 --> 1:30:10.240]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone. Anybody over 40 in the North American continent
[1:30:10.240 --> 1:30:15.440]  should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[1:30:42.800 --> 1:30:47.600]  try it. And if and only if you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it. Most likely,
[1:30:47.600 --> 1:30:51.280]  if you tried this, you'd be arrested. But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the

[1:33:37.520 --> 1:33:40.800]  Genesis Communication Radio Network.
[1:33:50.640 --> 1:33:54.320]  All right, let me calm down and go over this. I want everybody to listen to me and listen very,
[1:33:54.320 --> 1:34:02.880]  very carefully. There's a tactic that these mind controllers, these lawyers, these dirtbags,
[1:34:02.880 --> 1:34:10.240]  running societies, corporates use. They don't care if 91% of Americans want to control the borders,
[1:34:10.240 --> 1:34:14.240]  they leave them open. They don't care if 80% want the war to end and continues.
[1:34:15.120 --> 1:34:20.400]  They don't care if 98% in every major poll, in some cases higher, in some cases it was 100%
[1:34:20.400 --> 1:34:26.080]  some polls, were against the bank or takeover, bail out, they do it. But they also will lie and
[1:34:26.080 --> 1:34:32.400]  deny. We had ran corporation, UN documents, Club of Rome documents, CFR documents going back
[1:34:32.400 --> 1:34:37.840]  20, 30 years. You can just go to the CFR.org private group and Google World Government and
[1:34:37.840 --> 1:34:41.200]  you'll read hundreds of articles the last year saying, World Government, we're going to take
[1:34:41.200 --> 1:34:46.880]  your guns, we're going to tax you, we're going to have carbon taxes. But when they go on the news,
[1:34:46.880 --> 1:34:51.920]  they'll say it's a conspiracy theory, it doesn't exist. And Obama does this same thing.
[1:34:53.760 --> 1:34:57.840]  No, there's no plan for North American Union. It's been set up since 2005. We're under it,
[1:34:57.840 --> 1:35:04.640]  under treating. I mean, officially, the documents are public. And they will say none of this exists.
[1:35:05.360 --> 1:35:09.200]  Oh, there's no plan. You know, conspiracy theorists claim that international bankers are setting up
[1:35:09.200 --> 1:35:13.920]  a world government run by them and that you'll pay taxes to them. Then now hundreds of articles,
[1:35:13.920 --> 1:35:18.960]  Time Magazine, Newsweek, Wall Street Journal, you've all read it. A world government run by
[1:35:18.960 --> 1:35:23.200]  private banks because they're bankers and they know how to stop banking crises when they engineered
[1:35:23.200 --> 1:35:28.000]  it. Literally, Larry Summers runs the things in the White House with Geithner and they engineer
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:32.640]  what happened in the 90s that we're living in right now. I mean, you got to love it.
[1:35:33.440 --> 1:35:37.520]  And they say doesn't exist. No such thing as New World Order. No such thing as private global
[1:35:37.520 --> 1:35:42.560]  cartels. No such thing. No such thing. And they keep saying, oh, this is crazy conspiracy. There's
[1:35:42.560 --> 1:35:47.760]  no plans for guns. We don't want your second amendment. There's all these crazy paranoid
[1:35:47.760 --> 1:35:54.080]  people record gun sales. They're nuts. Obama comes out and says, believe me, I don't want your guns
[1:35:54.080 --> 1:35:58.880]  and they run out and buy more record gun sales. It's double anything it's ever been. Now, since
[1:35:58.880 --> 1:36:06.720]  he won the election, you know, five, six months straight. That's about six months now. Because
[1:36:06.720 --> 1:36:11.600]  people read the bills he introduced in Illinois for total gun bans. They read what his attorney
[1:36:11.600 --> 1:36:19.120]  general called for his deputy attorney general total gun ban. Nothing, nothing, nothing gone.
[1:36:19.120 --> 1:36:23.920]  No second amendment. Does that insult anybody that he said he wouldn't hire any lobbyists?
[1:36:23.920 --> 1:36:28.720]  That's all he hired or get us out of Iraq and he's expanded it or that he would do this,
[1:36:28.720 --> 1:36:32.640]  this and that or he would, he would give the detainees rights and didn't everything he says
[1:36:32.640 --> 1:36:36.640]  is a lie. Even if you agree with the guy, you got to kind of look around and find out what
[1:36:36.640 --> 1:36:41.040]  he's really doing instead of what it is you think you're agreeing with. And I'm not saying vote for
[1:36:41.040 --> 1:36:44.480]  the new Republican. They're going to try to shove down our throat in three or four years,
[1:36:44.480 --> 1:36:48.560]  you know, Rick Perry or something for president. It'll be the same thing. Meet the new boss,
[1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:53.840]  same as the old boss. Stop focusing on the puppets. And folks, I've read the Unideer treaties.
[1:36:55.120 --> 1:36:59.680]  Let me give you the date. One of them, the big meeting they had in New York City,
[1:37:00.480 --> 1:37:05.360]  passed the treaty in most of the world. US hadn't passed it yet. They're trying to pass it right
[1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:14.240]  now. What was it? It was July 7th, 2001, Unideer meeting in New York. And they said,
[1:37:14.240 --> 1:37:19.280]  small arms elicit traffic means all civilian owned guns and that all guns must be banned,
[1:37:19.280 --> 1:37:24.240]  that civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[1:37:25.360 --> 1:37:32.640]  Power monopoly. They say the legitimate, they believe what Hitler believes or Mao or Stalin,
[1:37:32.640 --> 1:37:37.760]  that the state should have a monopoly of power. Now the Romans had that. The Aztecs had that.
[1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:44.880]  The Nazis had that. The Chikoms have that. Fidel Castro has that. These Germans have that. Stalin
[1:37:44.880 --> 1:37:50.080]  had that. The Japanese show guns had that. Slaves couldn't own swords and they couldn't own arrows.
[1:37:50.080 --> 1:37:54.400]  They couldn't own bows. They couldn't own spears. You got it. It's real simple, folks.
[1:37:55.120 --> 1:38:00.080]  And I finish up with Lou Dobbs because I'm playing this clip because people don't believe me.
[1:38:00.080 --> 1:38:04.880]  They won't go to infowars.com two weeks ago when we wrote our article about how he's
[1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:10.480]  reintroduced the treaty. And it's got a good chance of passing. And I guess as they're coming
[1:38:10.480 --> 1:38:14.880]  for your guns, they'll cops will be loudspeakering. We're not taking your guns. We're just confiscating
[1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:19.120]  them. I tell you, I've had enough of this, folks. And let me tell you, go ahead and play the clip.
[1:38:19.920 --> 1:38:25.840]  Urging passage saying, quote, we should consider ratifying during this Congress the Inter-American
[1:38:25.840 --> 1:38:31.120]  Convention against illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, ammunitions,
[1:38:31.120 --> 1:38:37.760]  explosives, and related materials. Gun rights activists are incensed. That reflects a deep
[1:38:37.760 --> 1:38:42.720]  distrust that the government of the United States has had toward the people that somehow
[1:38:42.720 --> 1:38:49.200]  we need to be regulated because of other people's inability to have a peaceful and orderly society.
[1:38:49.200 --> 1:38:54.640]  Which cuts to the deep distrust that some gun owners have for government in general and specifically
[1:38:54.640 --> 1:39:01.200]  for this administration. President Obama as a senator consistently supported gun control legislation.
[1:39:01.200 --> 1:39:07.200]  His attorney general, Eric Holder, is also in favor of gun control. But one strong supporter
[1:39:07.200 --> 1:39:12.720]  of the Second Amendment in the Senate is determined to see the president does not get his wish.
[1:39:12.720 --> 1:39:17.200]  The president said it is a very high priority for him to get this treaty that takes away our
[1:39:17.200 --> 1:39:22.080]  Second Amendment rights ratified by the Senate. It is a very high priority for me to make sure
[1:39:22.080 --> 1:39:27.440]  that this treaty never gets ratified by the United States Senate and we will find the votes to defeat
[1:39:27.440 --> 1:39:33.360]  it. Gun control is an issue that the Democratic congressional leadership has not been eager
[1:39:33.360 --> 1:39:38.960]  to embrace just yet. But that is what has gun rights groups concerned about this treaty.
[1:39:38.960 --> 1:39:44.720]  It isn't being presented as gun control. Instead, Lewis being presented as an international treaty
[1:39:44.720 --> 1:39:51.280]  that has been ratified by 29 other countries. So therefore, it must be right that we ratify it
[1:39:51.280 --> 1:39:57.040]  as well. Well, I don't know who, what do you mean? It must be right because 29 other countries don't
[1:39:57.040 --> 1:40:01.520]  have a Second Amendment or a Constitution. Correct. And that seems to be President Obama's logic.
[1:40:01.520 --> 1:40:07.120]  Well, you know, we're fools if we don't pay attention to what is being done before very
[1:40:07.120 --> 1:40:13.120]  eyes and that's what is taking place. And no one can blame President Obama. We have only ourselves
[1:40:13.120 --> 1:40:18.320]  to blame because he's made it very clear as has his attorney general, the chief law enforcement
[1:40:18.320 --> 1:40:22.880]  officer in the country. They just want to do a few things with gun laws like take them away
[1:40:23.600 --> 1:40:27.280]  in large measure. Bill Tucker, thank you very much. Yeah, in fact, folks, and that's up on
[1:40:27.280 --> 1:40:33.200]  infowars.com. You want to see it, folks, we have a link to the stinking thing. It says, see,
[1:40:33.920 --> 1:40:40.240]  it has the definitions of explosives, ammo. You take the the Mayak report that we first broke
[1:40:40.240 --> 1:40:45.280]  in the DHS report, we broke all that news you heard of your new listener about how the veterans
[1:40:45.280 --> 1:40:49.840]  of the number one terror threat along with gun owners and conservatives. We're the ones we get
[1:40:49.840 --> 1:40:54.720]  sent those by the state police and the FBI. I just got sent something by an FBI agent Wednesday
[1:40:54.720 --> 1:40:58.720]  that I've been too busy to put up and write an article about, but that's coming the next few days.
[1:40:58.720 --> 1:41:05.200]  Wait till you see this. It's worse than everything you've ever seen. Sent to me by the FBI by good
[1:41:05.200 --> 1:41:11.680]  people inside there. Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are taking this nation over. They're
[1:41:11.680 --> 1:41:16.480]  saying the American people are terrorists. They're saying Homeland Security and this whole police
[1:41:16.480 --> 1:41:21.680]  state grid they built is for the American people. It's not for al-Qaeda. If you don't know al-Qaeda
[1:41:21.680 --> 1:41:25.840]  was set up by the CIA to attack the Russians in 79 to start that war, and you don't know they used
[1:41:25.840 --> 1:41:29.920]  them to attack the Serbs in the late nineties, and you don't know about arms for hostages and all
[1:41:29.920 --> 1:41:35.040]  that fine. But at least you should admit they're now going to use the anti-terror system and the
[1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:40.400]  federalization takeover against you because they know you're not going to like 80 percent taxes
[1:41:40.400 --> 1:41:46.080]  as the UN and the OECD and the XM Bank and the International Bank of Settlements and
[1:41:46.080 --> 1:41:50.640]  all of them have said. We're going to come back and go to your calls, but I just want everybody
[1:41:50.640 --> 1:41:57.280]  to understand something. Where is it in my stack? You can just Google monopoly of force
[1:41:58.640 --> 1:42:04.160]  UN, and you can find all the UN treaties and documents and their speeches and Christian
[1:42:04.160 --> 1:42:07.760]  science monitor articles. Let me think, how did I find all these articles today when I wanted to
[1:42:07.760 --> 1:42:16.960]  refresh my memory and pull this up? I googled, just Google the UN's war on firearms. That was a
[1:42:16.960 --> 1:42:22.720]  great story done by American opinion publishing that's got all these hyperlinks to all the treaties.
[1:42:22.720 --> 1:42:29.360]  In 2002, they wrote this, and you can just read that the UN's war on firearms and monopoly of
[1:42:29.360 --> 1:42:34.800]  force. Put that in after it. I mean, monopoly of force is dictatorship. Let's jam in another call
[1:42:34.800 --> 1:42:42.000]  here. It's really happening in these arrogant, smiley face, mind control, Madison Avenue pitchmen
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:47.120]  know that perceptions, reality, so they tell us, hey, we're not coming after your guns. We just
[1:42:47.120 --> 1:42:50.640]  want to confiscate them all. And that's what Obama says. He says, oh, you have a second
[1:42:50.640 --> 1:42:55.440]  amendment, right? But we have a right by law to curtail that to the point of total bans.
[1:42:55.440 --> 1:43:01.920]  That's what Holder argued last year before the Supreme Court. The attorney general is a treasonous
[1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:08.080]  traitor by the founding fathers statements and rules. Anybody against the bill of rights,
[1:43:08.080 --> 1:43:12.480]  the Constitution is a traitor. Thomas Jefferson, George Washington. But of course, they're terrorists.
[1:43:12.480 --> 1:43:17.600]  They're bad. I know. Fine. Go with Holder. Go with the stinking foreign bankers. Suck on the country,
[1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:22.000]  loose. You don't believe me. My film, Road to Tyranny, a police officer and fireman separately
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:28.800]  sent me footage of FEMA saying the founding fathers were bad. I have that video. We'll

[1:47:55.680 --> 1:48:00.800]  get fired about freedom. We're being overrun by parasites and scum and trash and a bunch of
[1:48:00.800 --> 1:48:05.680]  degenerate filth that think we're their slaves. It's time to slap them upside the head and tell
[1:48:05.680 --> 1:48:12.320]  them back off, scum. Don't forget for those of you out there to Google in the game blueprint for

[1:48:27.040 --> 1:48:33.360]  Casey in New York. You're on the air. Alex. Yes, Casey. Yeah, pleasure to talk to you.
[1:48:34.480 --> 1:48:40.720]  About the border patrol checkpoints. Yes. I traveled to Vermont frequently and back when
[1:48:40.720 --> 1:48:45.680]  Howard Dean was the front runner for the Democratic Party. George Bush installed one of those right
[1:48:45.680 --> 1:48:52.160]  in the center of the state. Yeah, I know. Over 100 miles in now. They just searched your car
[1:48:52.160 --> 1:48:56.960]  checkpoints five years ago and they let the illegal aliens go. It's on record. In fact,
[1:48:56.960 --> 1:49:03.040]  in the stimulus package, illegal aliens are exempt from having to show a federal approved ID
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:08.960]  to use the money, but citizens have to. Absolutely. It's bad to be a citizen because
[1:49:08.960 --> 1:49:13.200]  they weren't known as the schmucks that'll take anything. Yeah, I always find it interesting
[1:49:13.200 --> 1:49:18.160]  that it's coming up in the last year or so, you know, especially out west. And it's going away.
[1:49:18.160 --> 1:49:24.240]  They don't do it here anymore. That's because folks refuse to go along with it. Well, for the most
[1:49:24.240 --> 1:49:28.400]  part, yeah, but I think mostly it was just because Howard Dean had his explosion on TV and was no
[1:49:28.400 --> 1:49:33.040]  longer the front runner. And as soon as that happened, it disappeared. And then we're going to
[1:49:33.040 --> 1:49:38.960]  watch it in DC to take back the White House. Hey, man, good to hear from you. I don't think it's
[1:49:38.960 --> 1:49:44.640]  bad to get fired up. See, they've conditioned us that it's bad to get fired up. And I think it's
[1:49:44.640 --> 1:49:50.560]  good. I think it's really good. Let's go ahead and talk to Brian and Yonkers, New York, and then
[1:49:50.560 --> 1:49:56.080]  we're going to meet the new world order. Yeah, there you go. Let's go. Oh, my God, he got excited.
[1:49:58.560 --> 1:50:02.960]  Well, you may actually have to stass the road. That's not allowed. Let's go ahead and talk to
[1:50:02.960 --> 1:50:05.600]  I wouldn't make it funny. You last call. I was making fun of those that attacked Howard Dean for
[1:50:05.600 --> 1:50:12.160]  that. Brian and the Yonkers, New York, Brian, you're on the air. Yes, Alex. Hey, how are you doing?
[1:50:12.160 --> 1:50:17.280]  I love your energy and the Obama deception is the best man. I can't wait for the chemtrails
[1:50:17.840 --> 1:50:22.800]  to tell people what's in the air, man. Absolutely going to make a big weather control film.
[1:50:24.080 --> 1:50:27.360]  Oh, I'm so excited about that. And it's waking me up. But by the way,
[1:50:27.360 --> 1:50:31.360]  as they classify this, the general slaves don't know it. They can tell the slaves that
[1:50:31.360 --> 1:50:37.120]  that Texas didn't exist. And they'd go, Alex, it's a conspiracy theory. Texas doesn't exist.
[1:50:38.720 --> 1:50:40.640]  I got emails saying the euro doesn't exist.
[1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:48.080]  Well, I'm sorry. Go ahead. I'm sorry. No, I'm very obnoxious.
[1:50:48.080 --> 1:50:55.440]  Get your feedback, Alex, on this answering service called KGB. Have you seen commercials for it?
[1:50:55.440 --> 1:50:59.680]  No, but I hear the CIA ads on the radio every day as they're recruiting spooks to run our lives.
[1:50:59.680 --> 1:51:08.720]  Oh, Christ, Alex, I sent them, you know, my one question was, was 9 11 inside job? And
[1:51:09.600 --> 1:51:16.800]  they said, Oh, there's no proof. But some people say it is. And, you know, not even like,
[1:51:16.800 --> 1:51:21.360]  Oh, really? They're now having major university engineers at one of them on Friday from foreign
[1:51:21.360 --> 1:51:27.440]  countries like Denmark come out and document that they had thermate and thermite in the
[1:51:27.440 --> 1:51:32.720]  buildings. They found the unexploded thermite. It's been found in the records, multiple universities,
[1:51:32.720 --> 1:51:37.600]  peer reviewed. They blew those buildings high sky high. High sky.
[1:51:37.600 --> 1:51:44.160]  Absolutely. And you document that 9 11 truth. And that's a wonderful film as it is.
[1:51:44.160 --> 1:51:52.080]  The next day I had, you know, some, some freaking cops at my door asking about incriminating
[1:51:52.080 --> 1:51:55.440]  evidence on my computer or something. Yeah, it's all about intimidation.
[1:51:55.440 --> 1:52:01.600]  Here, listen, what do you think this is? America? It's a conspiracy theory that you got free speech
[1:52:01.600 --> 1:52:07.120]  to give people films. You're not allowed to have freedom. That's what I'll try to try and
[1:52:07.120 --> 1:52:12.240]  to give you. And then we're not going to put up with it. You know, I mean, seriously, I've been
[1:52:12.240 --> 1:52:17.600]  in New York and we've got footage in Truth Rising where the cops come up and go, your camera's a
[1:52:17.600 --> 1:52:22.960]  gun. We're going to put you in prison as a terrorist. You're not allowed to pro I'm not
[1:52:22.960 --> 1:52:27.360]  kidding. You can't make this up. It's unbelievable. Hey, you continue with your courage, sir.
[1:52:27.360 --> 1:52:30.560]  You tell them it's your first call me back during the weekday show and we have more time and
[1:52:30.560 --> 1:52:34.640]  tell me the rest of the story. I want to hear from you. Ronnie Ronnie in Spice Woods, Texas,
[1:52:34.640 --> 1:52:38.400]  which according to the media doesn't exist. Nothing exists. But the government tells you.
[1:52:38.400 --> 1:52:41.600]  So I have to wait for the government to tell me. I remember when the dollar was plunging.
[1:52:42.240 --> 1:52:45.440]  The media couldn't say it was plunging. They had to ask the White House Press Secretary
[1:52:45.440 --> 1:52:50.000]  Perino. Is it true the dollars dropping? She said, I can't answer that. I'd be fired if I told you.
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:56.800]  So I have to ask the media. A media to Spice Woods, Texas exist. I have to ask. I have to ask
[1:52:57.600 --> 1:53:03.440]  government, can you come over here and I went and clean me up. I just went to the bathroom.
[1:53:03.440 --> 1:53:08.560]  I need a groom here. Let's go ahead and talk to. I'm sorry, folks. Ronnie in Spice Woods, Texas.
[1:53:08.560 --> 1:53:12.480]  Go ahead. Thank you, sir. Yes, we did. We've received also from the planet,
[1:53:12.480 --> 1:53:16.320]  Bob Tartt. I'm sorry, I couldn't help but bother. That does exist according to the government.
[1:53:16.320 --> 1:53:20.880]  But there's two mind control events and we all need to stand up for peace and freedom.
[1:53:20.880 --> 1:53:25.760]  Peace and freedom don't exist, sir. You're without KIDA. But look, on 4th, 30th, my 50th, I was
[1:53:25.760 --> 1:53:30.880]  thrown out of an ATB grocery store here locally for carrying with me as always my Ron Paul Plackard
[1:53:30.880 --> 1:53:36.240]  with another also Plackard for peace and freedom. And the pitiful store employee hounded me out of
[1:53:36.240 --> 1:53:41.760]  the store because of my size. And that's the big highway 71. But you went in the store with your
[1:53:41.760 --> 1:53:46.960]  signs? Well, I carry them with me wherever I go. And you know, they really... Well, you know, I mean,
[1:53:46.960 --> 1:53:52.160]  I got to be honest and I love what you're doing. And maybe t-shirts are better. Of course, malls
[1:53:52.160 --> 1:53:58.080]  now are arresting people for pro-peace t-shirts. But the issue is, is that obviously that person
[1:53:58.080 --> 1:54:02.400]  recognized from the federal report that Ron Paul is terrorist. But no, I'm serious. You know,
[1:54:02.400 --> 1:54:07.200]  that's in the federal report. And bumper stickers for freedom or anti-U-Enter terrorism.
[1:54:07.920 --> 1:54:11.440]  But it is their private property, so it is their right to do that. You wouldn't,
[1:54:11.440 --> 1:54:14.800]  you know. Well, I challenge them, but this is not the first time they've actually called the
[1:54:14.800 --> 1:54:19.920]  sheriff on me before. So I've, but it's weird. They kind of blew it off for a while after I
[1:54:19.920 --> 1:54:24.640]  sent it on another, I don't know, I identified them on at the city council meeting or something.
[1:54:24.640 --> 1:54:29.760]  And it was too much. Also, at this city council meeting that very day, they also confiscated
[1:54:29.760 --> 1:54:33.840]  my sign. They never done that before. How am I? Well, you got it, sir. You're not allowed to have
[1:54:33.840 --> 1:54:38.640]  signs. You're not allowed to hand out videos. What is this, al-Qaeda or something? I mean, come on.
[1:54:38.640 --> 1:54:43.520]  Well, a terrorist calling in here. Nathan in Southern California, I hope you don't,
[1:54:43.520 --> 1:54:48.800]  you're calling into a show with free speech. In the future, it'll be granddaddy. Is it true once
[1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:52.800]  you were allowed to say what you thought? Yes, but don't tell anybody they'll arrest you. Okay.
[1:54:53.600 --> 1:54:59.280]  All right, watch out. Daddy, did we always have cameras inside our houses watching us?
[1:54:59.280 --> 1:55:03.520]  No, we didn't, but watch out. It's going to hear you. Nathan in Southern California,
[1:55:03.520 --> 1:55:08.000]  you're on the air. Hey Alex, how you doing? I don't know. It's pretty evil to be having a
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:12.800]  talk show with free speech. I'm pretty, maybe I'm a terrorist. I don't know. Hey, over here,
[1:55:12.800 --> 1:55:18.240]  we've had UN soldiers in our neighborhood. Oh yeah, they're having, I forgot, a UN drill
[1:55:18.240 --> 1:55:26.080]  in Southern California. A UN drill right now in Arizona for gun confiscation. That was actually
[1:55:26.080 --> 1:55:30.960]  part of the drill in their own admission. So how's it going with the UN trips? They are putting
[1:55:30.960 --> 1:55:36.560]  red discs on the doors right next to the doors and three of the homes on our street alone.
[1:55:36.560 --> 1:55:41.200]  Okay, wait a minute. Now this is different. I know they had trips from 11 Latin American
[1:55:41.200 --> 1:55:45.680]  countries landed for gun confiscation drills in Florida. That is confirmed. And I've been
[1:55:45.680 --> 1:55:49.680]  to these drills before, folks. They really trained to take your guns and admit it's for America.
[1:55:49.680 --> 1:55:53.520]  Where are you in Southern California and what are they doing? I'm up in the mountains
[1:55:54.320 --> 1:56:00.800]  in a rural area and they have came around and you know, me and my boy, this is one on our
[1:56:00.800 --> 1:56:05.760]  next door neighbor's house. We were playing horseshoes there yesterday. It was not there.
[1:56:05.760 --> 1:56:11.440]  Today there is a red disc on the right side of their door about the size of a half dollar.
[1:56:11.440 --> 1:56:15.760]  And you've seen the troops? We saw the troops in a California exempt car
[1:56:17.040 --> 1:56:21.440]  driving in our neighborhood while me and my boy was riding our bikes on our street. Well,
[1:56:21.440 --> 1:56:26.960]  for those that don't know, you can Google this. Hold on, let me think of the exact headline.
[1:56:27.920 --> 1:56:32.000]  One of hundreds, but this is a good one to put out because people can see this in another country
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:39.520]  in Scotland. They have Ukrainian troops, Google this if you can find it, Ukrainian troops scare
[1:56:39.520 --> 1:56:45.600]  Scots and they set up gun confiscation drills and checkpoints. This is like five years ago.
[1:56:45.600 --> 1:56:50.000]  And then remember in Iowa a few months ago and I had the colonel on the show, they were doing gun
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:55.520]  confiscation drills door to door and said, I was bad because I read the newspaper article on air
[1:56:55.520 --> 1:56:59.360]  and caused the drill to be canceled. Go out and get video of this, sir. That's amazing.
[1:56:59.360 --> 1:57:04.160]  Let's talk to Scott in Connecticut, probably another evil gun owner, probably another person
[1:57:04.160 --> 1:57:09.600]  that Homeland Security is upset about. Go ahead, Scott. Yes, evil gun owner here and greetings
[1:57:09.600 --> 1:57:16.080]  from the outskirts of the sanctuary city of Hartford, Connecticut. Yes. Hey, we got some
[1:57:16.080 --> 1:57:20.640]  censors takers roaming around our area. Oh great. Are they putting red markers on your door that
[1:57:20.640 --> 1:57:27.920]  you're able? No, not yet. One person apparently seemed to be going door to door, but buddy of mine
[1:57:27.920 --> 1:57:33.200]  was out putting some stuff in his car and that person, a woman mysteriously kind of just appeared
[1:57:34.240 --> 1:57:40.240]  and he asked if he could help her and said, oh no, no, she would be back to take his information.
[1:57:40.240 --> 1:57:45.600]  She was just sort of out canvassing her route, whatever that means. Oh yeah, sure. Why do you
[1:57:45.600 --> 1:57:49.600]  got a canvas to route when all you need to do is walk door to door? Yeah, it's total lies. They're
[1:57:49.600 --> 1:57:54.320]  GPSing everybody. It's admitted. I mean, they're GPSing you, send the federal SWAT teams if need
[1:57:54.320 --> 1:57:58.720]  be. The feds admit their canvassing when to send their death squads in against the American people.
[1:57:58.720 --> 1:58:03.760]  It's a lot of fun, isn't it? Oh, I think what we need to do is asking these people for ID. They
[1:58:03.760 --> 1:58:08.480]  should be ID'd from the Commerce Department or if they start mucking around with some GPS unit,
[1:58:08.480 --> 1:58:12.640]  they're obviously collecting information and that's supposed to be... Absolutely. I'm out of time.
[1:58:12.640 --> 1:58:15.760]  I'll be back during the week and back next Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Spread the word about this
[1:58:15.760 --> 1:58:21.520]  transmission. Great job team. Folks, rediscover liberty, get fired up about it and say, I'm not
[1:58:21.520 --> 1:58:28.080]  your slave. Hi, this is Ted Anderson introducing a new way to listen to GCN on your cell phone.

[1:58:56.240 --> 1:59:01.600]  investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986 yet the financial
[1:59:01.600 --> 1:59:06.640]  industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments
