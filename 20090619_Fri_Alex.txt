[03:10.680 --> 03:17.480]  wheelchair now it turned out the girl in the wheelchair was the daughter of a neocon developer
[03:17.480 --> 03:25.120]  construction individual with interesting ties to well quite a few interesting characters in and
[03:25.120 --> 03:34.160]  around 9-11 and we are changes at an event in New York now about a year ago and simply were
[03:34.160 --> 03:40.480]  trying to ask questions of world leaders politely when they were assaulted they said by the girl's
[03:40.480 --> 03:45.720]  father who then ran across the street with the wheelchair ramming it into them saying he is
[03:45.720 --> 03:50.920]  attacking her he is attacking my daughter and the police wouldn't release the surveillance
[03:50.920 --> 03:56.480]  camera tapes they wouldn't release the street cameras that happen to be on the scene and I had

[04:07.120 --> 04:14.280]  against him but the New York jury knows what that means they've learned oh that means it's a lie
[04:14.280 --> 04:20.840]  Secret Service says one thing it's the other police say one thing it's the other juries are meant
[04:20.840 --> 04:25.640]  to be that final last line of defense against tyranny and he was found not guilty and now a lot
[04:25.640 --> 04:30.360]  of you've opened yourselves up for serious liability New York Post hurriedly did a retraction

[08:27.920 --> 08:37.600]  okay coming up at the last 30 minutes of the show today the new york post has had to do a
[08:37.600 --> 08:47.360]  distraction a retraction fox news has not done one yet but they need to they reported as if it
[08:47.360 --> 08:55.280]  was an absolute convicted fact they didn't say alleged they said a 9-11 truth or savagely for
[08:55.280 --> 09:04.000]  no reason ran out of the darkness and attacked a girl in a wheelchair gary tallis goes by german
[09:04.000 --> 09:15.840]  tallis and we had all these we are chain witnesses we are change witnesses saying it was crazy the
[09:15.840 --> 09:19.840]  guy just came across the street and came over and started screaming at us ramming his daughter
[09:19.840 --> 09:25.360]  into a screaming don't attack my daughter and the secret service and police came over and said no
[09:25.360 --> 09:30.160]  you attacked her we're going to charge you with all these felonies of attacking a poor girl in a
[09:30.160 --> 09:36.640]  wheelchair and then they went and seized all the cameras and all the surveillance camera footage
[09:36.640 --> 09:43.440]  from the hotel and said it didn't exist well the jury heard all that and found mr tallis not guilty
[09:43.440 --> 09:51.680]  now why is that an important issue in the united states they are proposing to not allow jury trials
[09:51.680 --> 10:00.560]  in many types of court cases now and in england it's already been put into effect and i had the
[10:00.560 --> 10:07.200]  london guardian headline about how they're getting rid of juries and they even have secret trials
[10:07.200 --> 10:12.560]  now in england the same thing being adopted here kind of like obama announces cyber security
[10:12.560 --> 10:18.160]  to take over the entire web and end freedom on the internet as it's known england now is
[10:18.160 --> 10:24.160]  announced they're adopting australia is adopting and saying this means an end to free speech on the
[10:24.160 --> 10:32.960]  internet the government itself says we're putting in chinese communist chinese style
[10:32.960 --> 10:44.480]  net censorship this is on record
[10:44.480 --> 10:52.960]  so our journey towards complete and absolute tyranny is accelerating right now coming up
[10:52.960 --> 11:05.520]  later in the next hour we're going to start simulcasting for three hours today at prisonplanet.tv
[11:05.520 --> 11:14.480]  headline ron paul slams federal reserve new dictatorial powers and he did that on msnbc
[11:15.280 --> 11:22.800]  yesterday remember the article that paul watson wrote yesterday that i ask everybody to get out
[11:22.800 --> 11:30.240]  to as many people as they can because without a even a whimper certainly not a bang the white house
[11:30.240 --> 11:35.040]  has released the text of the new legislation they want to pass by the end of this session coming
[11:35.040 --> 11:41.680]  up in the fall to not just just let the federal reserve steal any amount of money at once but
[11:41.680 --> 11:53.920]  to come in and not just forcibly take over gm ford chrysler but to take over dealerships to take
[11:53.920 --> 11:59.520]  over restaurants to take over public and private lands and notice the supreme court ruled years
[11:59.520 --> 12:04.240]  ago private interest or government interest can take whatever they want not even for the public
[12:04.240 --> 12:10.080]  good just if the government feels like it and private interest can even give campaign contributions
[12:10.080 --> 12:17.040]  starting bidding wars to mayors and governors and others to come and take your property and
[12:17.040 --> 12:24.880]  give it to them that's the real outrage in the new london kilo decision and this isn't alex jones
[12:24.880 --> 12:30.080]  saying this the washington times the washington post the la times all reported
[12:31.840 --> 12:37.840]  wednesday and thursday that oh this gives the federal reserve the power to take over any industry
[12:37.840 --> 12:43.280]  any company any business or anything they want in the economy this is a dictatorship of the private
[12:43.280 --> 12:49.760]  bankers but now ron paul has come out and talked about it as well and said the federal reserve
[12:49.760 --> 12:58.800]  has more power than congress under this system just like the world trade organization was given
[12:58.800 --> 13:04.480]  more power congress voted away its authority back in the mid 1990s to a private world trade
[13:04.480 --> 13:09.600]  organization this is what globalization in new world order is all about it is where private
[13:09.600 --> 13:15.360]  corporate interests create international private corporate quasi-governmental bodies
[13:16.160 --> 13:21.040]  they're privately owned but have governmental power and then lobby the nation states
[13:24.720 --> 13:32.240]  japan germany england the united states and others to cede or hand their authority over
[13:32.240 --> 13:39.360]  to the new multinational private conglomerates via treaties that's what this is gat and nafta are
[13:39.360 --> 13:45.360]  treaties the world trade organization is a treaty nato is a treaty the united nations is a treaty
[13:45.360 --> 13:51.520]  we are treaty signatories to it then we sign other treaties like unesco sing the un runs college and
[13:51.520 --> 13:58.880]  high school accredited courses that they set the parameters that's why they teach your kids
[13:58.880 --> 14:02.720]  they've got a carbon footprint man made global warming is real and we've got to have
[14:02.720 --> 14:08.640]  one child policies and the family's bad that's why they do all of this
[14:15.280 --> 14:16.480]  that's why this is happening
[14:22.640 --> 14:27.360]  and now because the world's been operating for at least half a century under this system
[14:27.360 --> 14:34.160]  the banks are just coming out in the open and saying we are now going to be the bank of the world
[14:36.080 --> 14:40.160]  and you are going to pay your taxes to us and i know i repeat this day in and day out because
[14:40.160 --> 14:46.880]  this is all that matters congress through continuity of government through national
[14:46.880 --> 14:55.840]  security acts has been made to be ceremonial and reading the club of rome and cfr and trilateral
[14:55.840 --> 15:03.360]  commission all these documents on air over the years and making films like in game they had
[15:03.360 --> 15:07.920]  said they were going to create a new bank of the world that set carbon tax rates environmental
[15:07.920 --> 15:17.600]  policies world tax rates for the oecd organization of economic cooperative development and that
[15:17.600 --> 15:22.080]  through the central government through the continuity of government control grid they would
[15:22.080 --> 15:27.440]  administer but at least with the illusion that the national government still ran something
[15:27.440 --> 15:35.200]  they are jumping ahead and over that directly to the final phase of the regional governorship
[15:35.200 --> 15:40.720]  banks like the federal reserve it's part of a larger global consortium openly ruling everything
[15:42.480 --> 15:47.440]  it's just incredible and so i'm going to continue to hammer this and hammer this and
[15:47.440 --> 15:53.360]  hammer this and hammer this and hammer this until enough of the american people are aware
[15:53.360 --> 15:57.920]  of this is happening so they can inform others so we can get critical mass going
[15:59.200 --> 16:05.840]  so that people realize this is a bloodless economic total coup d'etat with a open new
[16:05.840 --> 16:09.440]  form of government being founded i mean in 1913 when the federal reserve took over the
[16:09.440 --> 16:14.720]  issuance of currency and credit a fourth branch of government that was privately owned and control
[16:14.720 --> 16:23.440]  was born it is now rendering obsolete it is now decommissioning wrecking splitting decimating
[16:23.440 --> 16:29.120]  annihilating let's say there's four train lines judicial the courts legislative the congress
[16:29.120 --> 16:33.200]  and executive the presidency those are four railway tracks going in the same direction
[16:34.000 --> 16:39.680]  next to it in 1913 they laid down the private fellow reserve line they transferred more and more
[16:39.680 --> 16:45.920]  power over to that new fourth line of government privately owned and run and now they don't want
[16:45.920 --> 16:50.320]  the people remembering the legitimate three branches of government so that power could be
[16:50.320 --> 16:58.720]  transferred back over to that and so they've got one of those rail splitters being drug over the other
[16:58.720 --> 17:05.040]  three lines tearing up all the railroad ties and dragging off the rail lines so that those three
[17:05.040 --> 17:12.080]  branches of government are rendered absolutely impotent not even impotent abolished executively
[17:12.080 --> 17:19.840]  so so first thing the bankers did after they laid down their fourth rail was they transferred most
[17:19.840 --> 17:25.840]  the power because that was the first step out of the judicial and legislative into the executive
[17:25.840 --> 17:35.760]  fraudulently and then now they're just removing any authority from those three branches all together
[17:35.760 --> 17:41.600]  and of course there was a true fourth rail not the fraudulent counterfeit fourth rail that the
[17:41.600 --> 17:47.920]  bankers created that was states rights in the states but the proper way to describe it is
[17:47.920 --> 17:58.560]  the foundation the bedrock the rail beds on which the three branches of government were
[17:58.560 --> 18:05.120]  laid and built the gravel beds was the states the confederation creating the federal government
[18:05.120 --> 18:12.480]  and so the feds have annihilated that as well so the offshore banks get in power in 1913
[18:12.480 --> 18:18.160]  they come in they take over the states they render the states vassals of the federal government
[18:18.160 --> 18:22.320]  then they start massing all the federal government's power so it's easily controlled and can be
[18:22.320 --> 18:27.680]  administered more easily through the fraud in the executive and now they're transferring all
[18:27.680 --> 18:32.880]  that executive power that's ill gotten and ill gained into the private hands of the private
[18:32.880 --> 18:39.920]  federal reserve which itself is a regional governorship of the world federalist system
[18:39.920 --> 18:44.240]  run by the private central banks who issue the world's currencies and credit and so they control
[18:44.240 --> 18:49.600]  the planet and that's why they're trying to shut down counties and cities and states and
[18:49.600 --> 18:54.880]  universities and businesses that are issuing their own currencies when you walk into a walmart and buy
[18:54.880 --> 19:04.560]  a gift card that is a form of alternative currency but it's based and denominated in
[19:04.560 --> 19:09.040]  federal reserve notes so the feds don't go after it but a lot of cities and counties
[19:09.040 --> 19:15.280]  have been issuing for decades their own script that is accepted and used for barter at restaurants
[19:15.280 --> 19:20.720]  and coffee shops and auto repair shops and golf courses and what have you the feds are rating
[19:20.720 --> 19:25.440]  and arresting these people all over the country right now they're arresting people trying to
[19:25.440 --> 19:31.440]  barter silver they're arresting people paying with two dollar bills they've got the clerks
[19:31.440 --> 19:37.360]  looking for people using alternative currencies so much that when somebody walks in with a two
[19:37.360 --> 19:43.360]  dollar bill the declaration of independence on the back which is federal reserve note you are
[19:43.360 --> 19:50.320]  arrested you are charged and in some cases you are convicted the juries are so dumb when the when
[19:50.320 --> 19:55.600]  the feds come in and say this is illegal they say you're going to jail buddy you're not allowed to
[19:55.600 --> 20:01.280]  use federal reserve notes if we say those are illegal as well mind control this is alex jones
[20:01.280 --> 20:05.840]  for american tax settlement we have received news the irs is currently accepting reduced settlements
[20:05.840 --> 20:11.440]  on back taxes and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of

[21:08.480 --> 21:14.400]  in creating the kind of world order that i think all of us would like to see the obama deception
[21:14.400 --> 21:19.200]  completely destroys the myth that obama is working for the best interest of the american people
[21:19.200 --> 21:24.880]  while obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one in this election if you have a demagogue
[21:24.880 --> 21:30.480]  with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group

[25:20.480 --> 25:24.720]  but the reason the private offshore banks are able to get away with this because it's so
[25:25.600 --> 25:31.840]  incredibly outrageous uh coming up we are going to be breaking that down with bob Chapman next hour
[25:31.840 --> 25:39.200]  or the international forecaster dot com ron paul slams federal reserves new dictatorial powers
[25:39.200 --> 25:45.760]  congressman tells msnbc that the very entity responsible for the economic crisis is now
[25:45.760 --> 25:52.160]  more powerful than congress now that's what ron paul said yesterday evening we said yesterday
[25:52.160 --> 25:59.360]  morning in our article breaking this down at prison planet dot com obama regulatory reform
[25:59.360 --> 26:04.560]  plan officially establishes banking dictatorship in the united states
[26:07.520 --> 26:11.680]  and i've even gotten emails people going oh it's not that bad okay let me explain something
[26:11.680 --> 26:17.200]  the banker bailout bill of last year said the federal reserve cannot be audited cannot be
[26:17.200 --> 26:21.920]  looked into none of the banks that are given the money can be investigated the money can go to
[26:21.920 --> 26:26.880]  offshore banks the money can go to china to pay them off to implement global carbon taxes that was
[26:26.880 --> 26:32.560]  in usa today they can do whatever they want their offshore private corporation and you don't have any
[26:32.560 --> 26:40.000]  say and it's unlimited money now they said that they would immediately spend the trillions of
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.160]  dollars not 700 billion they admitted that was just a really big number to put out there to you
[26:47.600 --> 26:53.120]  the 700 billion was just a really big number actually small compared to the real number
[26:53.120 --> 27:00.480]  just so people could quantify that it wasn't an unlimited amount but bloomberg reports 14.8 trillion
[27:00.480 --> 27:05.120]  in the first seven months since that bailout and that number's a month old we'll be getting new numbers
[27:05.120 --> 27:13.840]  soon just it makes me so angry i can hardly even continue this radio show right right now i'm serious
[27:16.800 --> 27:20.800]  i mean this is so outrageous people should be in the streets everywhere demanding
[27:20.800 --> 27:25.840]  that the federal reserve chairman be arrested that all these criminal offshore thugs that have
[27:25.840 --> 27:30.400]  come in and engage in a corporate takeover and then and then use the country like their own
[27:30.400 --> 27:37.840]  private credit card running up the debt to the stratosphere in your names and your children's names
[27:40.880 --> 27:46.080]  and so what new power could they get day one they said give us the bailout money and we will get
[27:46.080 --> 27:51.840]  the economy going and get the loans going and now interest rates in reality are higher people are
[27:51.840 --> 27:55.840]  like wait a minute interest rates are at zero i don't mean interest rates for the banks i mean
[27:55.840 --> 28:00.960]  the real interest rates are up less loans are being made that's official numbers
[28:04.480 --> 28:05.200]  comprende
[28:08.800 --> 28:13.280]  the economy is in freefall it's depression level already and it's going to be
[28:13.280 --> 28:19.600]  the unbelievably bad but the globalists are busy taking the tens of trillions they've stolen
[28:19.600 --> 28:24.000]  speculating in the stock market so some of the stocks are up and that's fooling some of the
[28:24.000 --> 28:30.320]  people out there heaven help you the real economy is dying and everything is being fed into the
[28:30.320 --> 28:38.240]  casino stock market it's all paper it's all derivative crud it's a fraud it's a scam
[28:38.240 --> 28:44.720]  and the bankers know that they've got to take all these trillions and get real assets and a lot of
[28:44.720 --> 28:49.520]  people aren't selling oh gee you're not going to sell we'll just federalize you and sell you off to
[28:49.520 --> 28:56.160]  foreign corporations oh you're still mills the fed say that's part of vital infrastructure they're
[28:56.160 --> 29:01.360]  seizing it and handing it over to foreign interest shareholders and the private fellow reserve
[29:02.160 --> 29:07.440]  so see what new power could they get if they were already given total secrecy and unlimited funds
[29:07.440 --> 29:12.640]  back in october last year the next phase would be to call for a new bank of the world with new
[29:12.640 --> 29:20.160]  regulatory powers over the planet and they've now done that and so their regional bank the
[29:20.160 --> 29:26.000]  federal reserve has to have the unlimited powers now so we can be ruled by this offshore behemoth
[29:27.840 --> 29:32.800]  and so they're going to run the congress the white house all private industries the bill
[29:32.800 --> 29:39.040]  states anything and everything connected to the economy they are over it and they got paramilitary
[29:39.040 --> 29:44.160]  enforcers ready to come into your factory your business your restaurant your car dealership
[29:44.160 --> 29:49.840]  and take it over they are going to steal physically at the point of a gun everything this country's

[37:24.160 --> 37:28.720]  girlfriend's home you got to love how they're arresting one of the mid-level little criminals
[37:28.720 --> 37:34.720]  that stole you know eight to 20 billion they're not sure like made off with 50 to 100 billion the
[37:34.720 --> 37:40.880]  founder of the nasdaq one of the people that helped set up this whole system and they and
[37:40.880 --> 37:45.920]  that oh he acted alone and his family gets to keep all the money sure he swindled people of
[37:46.560 --> 37:52.240]  over 100 billion dollars the media says 50 billion sure he did all that by himself
[37:57.600 --> 38:01.840]  under investigation and alleged eight billion dollar fraud involving sales and certificates
[38:01.840 --> 38:08.000]  of deposits through the antitrust bank see they sell those deposits they they leverage them they
[38:08.000 --> 38:11.840]  fractional reserve them surrendered to federal agents it was taken to
[38:15.600 --> 38:20.800]  federal custody as lawyers said stanford 59 surrendered yesterday to federal bureau
[38:20.800 --> 38:25.360]  investigation agents who were waiting outside his girlfriend's house in fredericksburg virginia
[38:25.360 --> 38:32.480]  said dick degrenia a lawyer for the texas financier stanford scheduled to appear today
[38:32.480 --> 38:37.600]  in the u.s district court enrichment according to a government official and they're going to burn
[38:37.600 --> 38:44.240]  a few mid-level criminals involved in all this but bernacky and the rockefellers and the roth
[38:44.240 --> 38:52.000]  child's the ones running at all green span nothing is going to happen to them and that's
[38:52.000 --> 38:57.600]  why when congress says tell us where the trillions went they say i don't have to tell you i'm not
[38:57.600 --> 39:02.640]  going to tell you and they tell senator sanders that and they tell ron paul that in the house and
[39:02.640 --> 39:07.200]  senate banking committees and they go on tv and say we're above the law and by the way we're not
[39:07.200 --> 39:13.280]  just above the law now we're not just outside the law and community crime we want we now are going to
[39:13.280 --> 39:19.360]  have the homeland security and the arm department of treasury and the fbi and everybody else under
[39:19.360 --> 39:25.680]  us with weapons and we're going to come and take your businesses you won't sell us because you know
[39:25.680 --> 39:30.080]  we got all these tens of trillions we've stolen and created out of nothing we're going to come
[39:30.800 --> 39:34.880]  make you sell to us or in some cases they don't even make you sell they just take it
[39:38.640 --> 39:43.200]  that's why we got a lot at the federal reserve we got to get on the offensive against these people
[39:43.200 --> 39:47.040]  and discredit them and expose them that's why they've hired thousands of professors and high
[39:47.040 --> 39:50.720]  school teachers to go out and do community service things where they pay for free food
[39:50.720 --> 39:56.560]  and drinks and have the public at hotel balls all they've had five or six i've seen in the news in
[39:56.560 --> 40:01.440]  austin where they whine and dine and teach everybody the federal reserve is the answer to
[40:01.440 --> 40:07.360]  everything and basically offer the people jobs if they'll be little minion little soviet agents of
[40:07.360 --> 40:15.360]  the private fed they're just spawning private minions to go around enforcing on us usually
[40:15.360 --> 40:18.880]  don't have to pay these people off they just have local talk show host and media people
[40:18.880 --> 40:24.480]  to a federal reserve banquet and buy them a t-bone steak and they'll sell their whole family out for
[40:24.480 --> 40:35.520]  a million years there's a report here out of the associated press uh dod giving the fed more power
[40:35.520 --> 40:41.680]  is like awarding a son a bigger faster car right after he crashed the family station wagon
[40:41.680 --> 40:49.200]  that's dod playing politics remember remember when obama tried to burn dod and said dod was the one
[40:49.200 --> 40:55.680]  that had given banker uh anonymity and allowed money from the stimulus package to go to banker
[40:55.680 --> 41:00.320]  bonuses and dod went what do you mean you signed the executive order and told the congress to
[41:00.320 --> 41:04.560]  add that in there you wouldn't sign it in the white house said okay you're right and backed off
[41:04.560 --> 41:12.480]  they were so arrogant they were trying to blame it on their little low-level demon dod
[41:13.040 --> 41:18.720]  have all these idiot democrats send me emails going oh obama he's fighting uh fighting the
[41:18.720 --> 41:24.160]  banker bailout no tim geithner ran the private new york fed the real fed the one that runs all
[41:24.160 --> 41:30.640]  the others one ring to rule them all and in the darkness behind them he was the one mainstream
[41:30.640 --> 41:36.160]  news admits telling bush and paulson what to do because he was the one at the federal reserve
[41:36.160 --> 41:45.120]  giving the money to goldman sacks headed up by the treasury secretary and now geithner's on the news
[41:45.120 --> 41:52.560]  saying you have got to give unlimited money and funding to the federal reserve i advise you to
[41:52.560 --> 41:59.440]  give them unlimited power when that little bastard is a shareholder in the banks that own shares in
[41:59.440 --> 42:05.840]  the private fed when that little creatures the former chief executive officer of the key federal
[42:05.840 --> 42:12.240]  reserve bank and i'll tell you what this dictator ship's doing it's even shut down the other fed
[42:12.240 --> 42:17.920]  governorships that local regional banks thought they were part of they've all been bitching and
[42:17.920 --> 42:22.880]  complaining even in bloomberg saying we've been completely shut off and this is a coup d'etat
[42:22.880 --> 42:29.200]  in fact member two months ago bloomberg headline fed governor says federal reserve involved in
[42:29.200 --> 42:36.400]  takeover in financial coup it is a coup d'etat by an offshore group of pirates
[42:41.760 --> 42:45.200]  it is outrageous it is just unbelievably outrageous the chairman of the senate banking
[42:45.200 --> 42:50.240]  committee goes for dod quoted a critic of the plan to expand the federal reserve powers
[42:50.240 --> 42:55.280]  in the banking committee hearing he said like awarding a son a bigger faster car right after
[42:55.280 --> 43:00.880]  he crashed the family station wagon he added that he hadn't made a conclusion on the issue so see
[43:00.880 --> 43:06.960]  he's acting like he's against it but the bastard will vote for it watch see they'll act like they're
[43:06.960 --> 43:13.600]  against all this stuff and then george washington blogspot says the critic is corrected that the
[43:13.600 --> 43:18.560]  fed caused the great depression according to brunack himself the fed largely caused the current
[43:18.560 --> 43:24.000]  caused the current financial crisis the fed creates new money out of thin air and then charges massive
[43:24.000 --> 43:30.080]  amounts in interest to the federal government in publishing the nation and stealing its wealth
[43:30.080 --> 43:34.000]  and the fed has refused to tell congress and the american people where the trillions of
[43:34.000 --> 43:38.720]  dollars in bailout money are going and then he has all the links i love his writing everything's
[43:38.720 --> 43:45.280]  documented so it's simple things are only going to get worse and worse and worse in the economy
[43:45.280 --> 43:50.240]  and they're going to force you to serve them work in their industries in their police state system
[43:50.240 --> 43:55.600]  they're converting us for manufacturing and jobs and farming to police state and then they own the
[43:55.600 --> 44:08.560]  police state private grid period that's coming up with bob Chapman here's some of the other news
[44:08.560 --> 44:14.960]  aclu ron paul's campaign for liberty sue tsa over illegal detention remember the audio of
[44:14.960 --> 44:21.840]  him secretly recording it campaign for liberties having a huge event selling t-shirts coca-cola
[44:21.840 --> 44:27.920]  you name it the other they got 50 000 people coming into kansas city to have an event their
[44:27.920 --> 44:33.680]  treasurer flies in with what was it uh five thousand dollars you'd have thought he had more
[44:34.400 --> 44:39.680]  and in america they search his bag going to the checkpoint find the cash and they pull him aside
[44:39.680 --> 44:43.760]  and they're about to steal the money under asset forwarder seizure like they do little old ladies
[44:43.760 --> 44:48.240]  are in texas on the side of the highway every day that's on the news they said you're going to answer
[44:48.240 --> 44:51.760]  our questions and he said i'm not going to answer any of your questions free country
[44:54.240 --> 44:57.280]  but meanwhile i had gary franchi in here he used to do loss prevention
[44:58.080 --> 45:02.080]  for a major retailer and i've talked to so many others just like him and they'd catch illegal
[45:02.080 --> 45:08.880]  aliens stealing stuff at the department store and they'd have fake ids and the cops would let them go
[45:08.880 --> 45:16.080]  but if a 16 year old zit faced a teenage girl got caught stealing something they had the book
[45:16.080 --> 45:22.480]  thrown at him and they're never coming out of the prison system basically that's how america
[45:22.480 --> 45:28.720]  works we are known as the idiot schmucks we are known as the suckers we are known as the fools
[45:28.720 --> 45:34.000]  we are known as the people that will buy anything and will put up with anything because we think
[45:34.000 --> 45:40.400]  we're free but no don't want to harass the precious little illegal aliens i remember three years ago
[45:40.400 --> 45:45.120]  they were trying to pass the blanket amnesty plan and and and the congress said don't worry we promise
[45:45.120 --> 45:51.920]  is not an amnesty but the bill is secret but then senator sessions of alabama leaked the bill and it
[45:51.920 --> 45:57.200]  was total complete amnesty for even felons and they could bring their family members here unlimited
[45:57.200 --> 46:03.440]  wide open borders it would end illegal immigration because nothing would be illegal i remember the
[46:03.440 --> 46:07.920]  ap article saying oh yes we're trying to do this to help the illegals in the tough economic times
[46:07.920 --> 46:14.400]  they were still denying it was bad times for everybody else and also we're making sure that we
[46:14.400 --> 46:18.880]  give them loans even if it's not secured we don't give this to citizens but we want to help the
[46:18.880 --> 46:25.520]  immigrant communities see i told you about a lady i know a good family friend who ran one of the
[46:25.520 --> 46:30.720]  biggest department complexes in the state of texas she managed several of them here in austin
[46:30.720 --> 46:36.000]  for the biggest apartment company in the nation the owner of it just committed suicide a few
[46:36.000 --> 46:41.840]  months ago he was found dead in his burnout car in west texas totally staged his death that's clear
[46:43.280 --> 46:46.720]  but this family friend who i've known since i was a little kid
[46:47.520 --> 46:52.080]  but the point is she you know i i'm now hearing about the latest chapters in the saga but going
[46:52.080 --> 46:56.560]  back five years ago they have him up to the christmas party in dallas for all the managers
[46:56.560 --> 47:08.080]  and they tell them we've secretly been federalized we have secretly been federalized and uh they're
[47:08.080 --> 47:13.280]  not we don't have to pay income taxes anymore on any of our properties in a deal with homeland
[47:13.280 --> 47:20.160]  security but we are to give illegal immigrants apartments no matter how many they have in it if
[47:20.160 --> 47:26.160]  it says two occupancy they can have ten but we want you to drive the citizens out because we've got
[47:26.160 --> 47:33.200]  to convert to at least half of our occupants being on this new government housing program part of
[47:33.200 --> 47:39.120]  infrastructure protection and she's telling me all of this and i already knew about it but here it
[47:39.120 --> 47:45.120]  was directly where they get to do whatever they want you want a shoplift you want a drunk drive
[47:46.080 --> 47:52.000]  you want to not have insurance red carpet they're passing laws all over the country where license
[47:52.000 --> 47:56.560]  plate reading cameras scan your license plate they're already doing it but that feeds into software
[47:56.560 --> 48:02.320]  and the day your insurance is out you're going to get arrested because you're a fat stupid slave
[48:02.320 --> 48:06.320]  land of the cowards home of the yellow bellies that'll put up with anything
[48:10.000 --> 48:16.560]  but an illegal alien gets pulled over red carpets shoot out in front of them you want houses and
[48:16.560 --> 48:22.400]  don't have credit you got it you want to be able to have 10 people in a efficiency apartment you
[48:22.400 --> 48:28.000]  got it you want to be above the law you got it you want to be able to shoplift you got it
[48:29.360 --> 48:34.480]  because this is a criminal government at the top the bankers can steal loot rob they want the
[48:34.480 --> 48:38.800]  illegals here to drive down ways used to blow out their enemy the middle class this is military
[48:38.800 --> 48:43.920]  warfare pressure from below pressure from above got the bankers and the irs throwing everything
[48:43.920 --> 48:49.120]  they got at the american people meanwhile billionaires cannot be audited because they don't even allow
[48:49.120 --> 48:54.240]  the irs to audit them don't even allow case officers at that level that's mainstream news
[48:54.240 --> 49:00.720]  half of congress ap reports doesn't even pay taxes it's all just a sickening joke of criminals running
[49:00.720 --> 49:05.680]  around everywhere and they want the third world populations up here to blow out the wages and
[49:05.680 --> 49:10.640]  bankrupt america so nobody had a chance and so everybody had to go into debt to the credit cards
[49:10.640 --> 49:15.040]  and so everybody would implode and so both the mother and father had to work so the kids
[49:17.760 --> 49:23.280]  would have to stay in school past three o'clock four o'clock so the tv and the government could
[49:23.280 --> 49:27.520]  raise the kids so the parents wouldn't and they've done a great job and they've devastated us and
[49:27.520 --> 49:31.600]  the public's a bunch of brain dead animals who can't even hardly string a sentence together
[49:31.600 --> 49:36.400]  and everything's collapsing and falling apart and the new world order using high tech psych warfare
[49:36.400 --> 49:40.880]  and economic warfare has devastated the nation and now they're rolling in with a completely
[49:40.880 --> 49:49.200]  engineered depression to bring in a hardcore tyranny and mop up the operation and they're
[49:49.200 --> 49:56.640]  shifting the entire military over to skynet and that's not from the 1984 movie with the terminator
[49:56.640 --> 50:03.200]  Arnold Schwarzenegger the script writers from that got all of that from pentagon battle plans
[50:03.200 --> 50:13.840]  for skynet ground net smart net smart dust skynet blimps skynet hovercraft skynet drones i went to

[50:27.680 --> 50:33.440]  are the very drones that i saw on fox news five years ago they're going to deploy in america
[50:33.440 --> 50:39.120]  we're going to be under skynet but controlled by humans and they're going to carry out their
[50:39.120 --> 50:45.120]  extermination grid against the population of the planet you think i'm joking around it's all in
[50:45.120 --> 50:51.920]  the government documents ladies and gentlemen it's a sickening joke how they throw it in our

[1:00:31.760 --> 1:00:36.000]  thank you so much for joining us we're now into the second hour of this friday edition
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:43.440]  the 19th day of june 2009 bob chavin with us for the next uh hour and we've got several
[1:00:43.440 --> 1:00:48.560]  guests in studio dealing with the fluoridation of the water supply fluoride's a catchall term
[1:00:48.560 --> 1:00:53.520]  sodium fluoride is bad enough for you but we're going to break down what is really being put
[1:00:54.400 --> 1:01:00.640]  in the water supply today and the successful fight against fluoridation going on around the planet
[1:01:00.640 --> 1:01:06.320]  there is hope ladies and gentlemen so key information coming up there uh i've been ranting
[1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:11.200]  and raving the last three days because they've now unveiled and it's worse than i first thought it
[1:01:11.200 --> 1:01:16.080]  would be i knew the banks had gotten unlimited power to loot and steal but now it says to seize
[1:01:16.080 --> 1:01:20.880]  any corporation any company take over the nation that they're implementing the executive orders
[1:01:21.760 --> 1:01:25.920]  already in place for economic martial law i'm going to go over some of those executive orders
[1:01:25.920 --> 1:01:31.040]  this hour and they're using the swine flu as another cover for that but ron paul has said this
[1:01:31.040 --> 1:01:38.000]  is a financial dictatorship he agrees with me uh he has now come out and pointed out that
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:42.560]  the federal reserve is to get more power than even congress under this new system so they
[1:01:42.560 --> 1:01:47.520]  engineer the crisis get unlimited money now they want the power to seize not just gm and
[1:01:47.520 --> 1:01:54.160]  ford and chrysler but factories restaurants businesses dealerships and then they admit
[1:01:54.160 --> 1:01:58.960]  that the democratic party mainly keeps the dealerships they want and sells the others
[1:01:58.960 --> 1:02:04.560]  and gives them to friends i mean this is happening faster than i even thought it could
[1:02:05.120 --> 1:02:10.080]  bob Chapman of course was in uh military intelligence in berlin we got out of the
[1:02:10.080 --> 1:02:15.120]  military he became the biggest golden silver broker individual silver broker out there
[1:02:15.120 --> 1:02:18.720]  he had one of the largest newsletters and he retired he came back it's the international
[1:02:18.720 --> 1:02:23.440]  forecaster he's been a guest on international tv and ready to go literally thousands of times
[1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:29.920]  he joins us each friday uh bob this is getting even crazier quicker than i thought can you
[1:02:29.920 --> 1:02:38.480]  break down what this new quote regulatory overhaul is well i think what they want to do here is be
[1:02:38.480 --> 1:02:50.800]  able to control all forms of financial um massinations if you may uh anything that has to do with
[1:02:50.800 --> 1:02:57.680]  money and what i think they're going to do is if they can get away with it and there's a lot of
[1:02:57.680 --> 1:03:08.880]  resistance in congress and that's borne out by the numbers i received yesterday on uh hr 1207
[1:03:09.680 --> 1:03:18.080]  which is ron paul's bill to uh out at the federal reserve i understand it's 258 cosponsors
[1:03:18.080 --> 1:03:26.960]  and that means that there's a lot of people in congress even though five or ten percent of their
[1:03:26.960 --> 1:03:35.680]  campaign contributions come from wall street banking insurance etc i think they're under so much
[1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:42.080]  pressure from the public not only the constituents but others who are writing them that this is a
[1:03:42.080 --> 1:03:50.960]  phenomenal amount of cosponsors so i do not think they're going to get through this proposed rule
[1:03:50.960 --> 1:03:59.760]  changes so that the federal federal reserve can become a monster money czar if you want to call
[1:03:59.760 --> 1:04:05.920]  it that they like that word czar very much i think they've created about 14 or 15 of them
[1:04:05.920 --> 1:04:15.040]  um anyway i also want to refer here to your report on prison planet uh obama regulatory form plan
[1:04:15.680 --> 1:04:21.360]  officially establishes banking dictatorship in the united states and it's really terrific it it's
[1:04:21.360 --> 1:04:27.280]  kind of like an outline and for those of you who haven't seen it please go and take a look at it
[1:04:27.280 --> 1:04:35.280]  it's a day to june 18th which was yesterday well bob break down why from your perspective why it's
[1:04:35.280 --> 1:04:41.760]  so important and also you were in intelligence in berlin they're now admitting the cia's hiring
[1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:47.520]  domestic bankers to go out and help set up this financial dictatorship because if they can control
[1:04:47.520 --> 1:04:52.000]  the economy and the money they're going to control everything and this is their their tool to bring
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:56.560]  in their new world order so i want to break that down and how we defeat it how we fight back against
[1:04:56.560 --> 1:05:02.800]  it the bob chappan on the other side of this quick break this is alex jones with five good reasons

[1:05:23.040 --> 1:05:27.600]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead number
[1:05:27.600 --> 1:05:31.920]  four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again every year thousands of
[1:05:31.920 --> 1:05:36.720]  families lose their power from weather related outages number five a solar power generator

[1:08:18.960 --> 1:08:25.920]  i want to open the phones up financial questions only for bob chatman there's a million of those
[1:08:25.920 --> 1:08:39.520]  to ask 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 bob chatman is our guest right now going back to bob bob for
[1:08:39.520 --> 1:08:45.200]  stations that just joined us we were going over obama regulatory reform plan officially establishes
[1:08:45.200 --> 1:08:49.760]  banking dictatorship in the united states and in a few minutes i'm going to play a short
[1:08:49.760 --> 1:08:56.640]  ron paul clip where he says yes the banks will have more authority under this than congress and the
[1:08:56.640 --> 1:09:01.920]  way the bill reads even the la times admitted that it gives them power over anything connected to the
[1:09:01.920 --> 1:09:10.000]  economy any market any company from a hotdog stand to a bank to an insurance company and and
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:14.320]  you were getting into our article from present planet dot com obama regulatory reform plan
[1:09:14.320 --> 1:09:20.400]  officially establishes banking dictatorship in the united states is it that it's so big and so
[1:09:20.400 --> 1:09:26.400]  over the top people have trouble realizing the magnitude of the very banks that engineered the
[1:09:26.400 --> 1:09:32.880]  crisis that have stolen tens of trillions they now not only won't tell us where the money went
[1:09:32.880 --> 1:09:38.800]  but they are going to be the regulators of themselves and over the rest of main street
[1:09:38.800 --> 1:09:46.800]  they've already devastated this is a form of dictatorship there's no question uh the important
[1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:53.840]  things are that there is no control whatsoever by congress which you've mentioned and it is a
[1:09:53.840 --> 1:10:01.360]  private corporation they refuse to answer government subpoenas they say that it's a state secret when
[1:10:01.360 --> 1:10:07.600]  asked about what they're doing and that's why ron paul's bill is so important we can cut this whole
[1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:15.440]  thing off at the pass if that bill is passed and it certainly stands a great chance in the house of
[1:10:15.440 --> 1:10:23.680]  passing uh one of the things that i thought of in regard to this which sort of meshes what you
[1:10:23.680 --> 1:10:32.160]  were talking about earlier about the hiring of people for the cia to go into economic and
[1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:42.560]  financial matters i think that uh the at this time the uh the treasury department in conjunction
[1:10:42.560 --> 1:10:49.360]  with the fed and the people who control our government from behind the scenes they are
[1:10:49.360 --> 1:10:58.480]  making this move in behalf of the fed now as an offense in a defensive manner because of what's
[1:10:58.480 --> 1:11:05.920]  going on in congress what they want to say is well we want the fed to be able to handle these
[1:11:05.920 --> 1:11:12.320]  things and you want to audit it or shut it down and we can't have that because it's so crucial
[1:11:12.880 --> 1:11:17.680]  this is what they're up to here i was about to ask you that this looks like kind of a fleeing
[1:11:17.680 --> 1:11:22.800]  forward or asking for the moon because they're under attack people are saying we're going to
[1:11:22.800 --> 1:11:28.160]  audit you there's subpoenas from congress they're refusing those subpoenas from congress so really
[1:11:28.160 --> 1:11:32.880]  this constitutional crisis is forming there shouldn't be a crisis this isn't the president
[1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:38.400]  refusing subpoenas this is a private offshore bank that's getting all these public funds saying you
[1:11:38.400 --> 1:11:43.600]  can't look at what we're doing after promising the public it would all be transparent and their
[1:11:43.600 --> 1:11:48.480]  ace in the hole is they own the president uh and they own the military industrial complex you know
[1:11:49.280 --> 1:11:55.840]  so speak to that but then also uh we have uh mr perkins who wrote confessions of an economic
[1:11:55.840 --> 1:12:00.640]  hitman and i've actually interviewed him now for the next obama film coming out john perkins
[1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:07.280]  and uh mr perkins you know was hired by the nsa and the cia top of his class family and all these
[1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:13.600]  big corporations he was sent in he would give he would be given orders by army generals into third
[1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:19.440]  world countries to buy off politicians to threaten them to take control do the same thing and now
[1:12:19.440 --> 1:12:26.560]  reuters says the cia is going to operate inside the us and is hiring all these out-of-work bankers
[1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:34.480]  to make sure we are all under economic slavery bob that's exactly right exactly right and that's
[1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:41.280]  what all of that recruiting is all about they want to use these people against us one of the things
[1:12:41.280 --> 1:12:47.920]  that's behind this and incidentally to just go a little bit further on their recruiting
[1:12:47.920 --> 1:12:57.280]  uh and uh but but further than that is what they're up to here is this is pure psychological warfare
[1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:04.240]  that's exactly what it is they know that the house is going to vote for this bill i don't
[1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:10.240]  know what the senate will do but i assume perhaps they will as well you know in order to cut that
[1:13:10.240 --> 1:13:18.560]  off what they're trying to do is say we can't allow the fed to be audited or tampered with in
[1:13:18.560 --> 1:13:24.640]  any way because it's too important and so on and so forth this is the cy war aspects of it
[1:13:24.640 --> 1:13:29.600]  yeah we're in the middle of a crisis if we if you audit the fed they're already saying this it's
[1:13:29.600 --> 1:13:34.800]  going to cause a depression they've hired this big lobbying firm and we now see their branding
[1:13:34.800 --> 1:13:40.160]  if you audit us it'll destroy confidence and we'll have a depression and we're going into a depression
[1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:44.880]  that way even if we get the audit they'll blame us for the depression they engineered
[1:13:46.320 --> 1:13:52.560]  that's correct and of course anybody who has any financial background whatsoever looks at this
[1:13:52.560 --> 1:13:58.400]  thing and says i mean these are the guys that caused this thing how can we allow them to take us out
[1:13:58.400 --> 1:14:07.280]  of it and which is ridiculous but anyway the recruiting is for uh to do exactly as you said
[1:14:07.280 --> 1:14:15.280]  but it goes one step further the concept behind the thought pattern of the elitist is that all the
[1:14:15.280 --> 1:14:24.400]  money in america all the wealth in the world for that matter belongs to them it does not belong to
[1:14:24.400 --> 1:14:31.120]  you you have it on a temporary basis and so consequently i think that they what they're
[1:14:31.120 --> 1:14:38.400]  going to do eventually in other countries will follow they will probably set up currency controls
[1:14:38.400 --> 1:14:44.640]  of some kind not right away in the future maybe two or three years down the line when inflation
[1:14:44.640 --> 1:14:50.480]  is going bonkers again but these are some of the things that that's what they're announcing
[1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:55.440]  they're saying in australia they're going to make people go to chips no more cash even if you use
[1:14:55.440 --> 1:15:00.240]  cash here it's going to be tied to a thumb print or a face print to quote stop the underground
[1:15:00.240 --> 1:15:08.560]  economy and this really is a worldwide financial dictatorship run by intelligence agents uh
[1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:14.240]  bob back when you were in uh intelligence before you got into finance uh you know they told you
[1:15:14.240 --> 1:15:17.840]  guys you were doing what you're doing fighting the dirty commies and you know there was some
[1:15:17.840 --> 1:15:22.720]  truth to that but now how are they going to recruit these bankers and people to go around
[1:15:22.720 --> 1:15:27.840]  butchering america and forcibly taking over corporations i mean they're saying the fed
[1:15:27.840 --> 1:15:34.080]  is going to go in and reorganize the economy and grab whatever industries they want we're basically
[1:15:34.080 --> 1:15:40.880]  only select uh crony capitalist institutions are going to be allowed to even survive much less
[1:15:40.880 --> 1:15:47.280]  prosper i mean the people that are being recruited by cia uh are they either idiots or they just
[1:15:47.280 --> 1:15:54.240]  outright evil and are going to enjoy being able to go out and commit crime well usually uh
[1:15:54.240 --> 1:16:01.600]  unfortunately they draw some of the best people and uh my experience with the people that i was
[1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:07.680]  involved with uh they were all extraordinarily bright uh but at that time we didn't have the
[1:16:07.680 --> 1:16:14.640]  things going on that we have today and today there are not jobs out there for people who are
[1:16:14.640 --> 1:16:22.480]  sometimes double and triple agreed and so uh out of uh the the fact that they can't get a job
[1:16:22.480 --> 1:16:29.280]  anywhere that's decent at the cia offers them a good position they're going to take it because
[1:16:29.280 --> 1:16:34.320]  they're going to say if i don't take it i'm not going to eat and so they take our tax money and
[1:16:34.320 --> 1:16:40.480]  then hire economic goons to who literally go around and blow out what's left of us companies
[1:16:40.480 --> 1:16:45.920]  so they can be looted off to the internationalist i mean that's what's happening bob that's right
[1:16:45.920 --> 1:16:51.760]  and the police are in america with this federalization are in the same bag i mean they
[1:16:51.760 --> 1:16:59.360]  they quit their job and become part of the program this is how they capture people and you know unless
[1:16:59.360 --> 1:17:05.200]  you want to leave your job there's no way out you gotta stay and do the dirty work of the bad guys
[1:17:06.720 --> 1:17:13.120]  my god bob uh they're announcing unemployment numbers exploding housing prices plunging even
[1:17:13.120 --> 1:17:19.120]  faster uh the fed coming out and saying forget having a bank of the world they're still gonna
[1:17:19.120 --> 1:17:24.960]  have that and a global currency controls and global interest rate controls and and and setting
[1:17:24.960 --> 1:17:31.360]  global taxes to stop tax avoidance havens as the oe cd says can you explain to people
[1:17:32.320 --> 1:17:40.080]  what it means that the fed is jumping directly two or three pieces to the end game immediately i
[1:17:40.080 --> 1:17:48.080]  didn't see that happening i didn't either and uh i was really shocked that they went this way
[1:17:48.080 --> 1:17:55.280]  in this offensive way as a defense but you know in psychological warfare this is the
[1:17:55.280 --> 1:18:02.240]  kind of thing that you do and what they're asking for is us and then probably world financial
[1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:08.160]  domination and you're absolutely right uh and you know you talk about these offshore accounts
[1:18:08.160 --> 1:18:17.760]  the u.s. uh treasury has had as well as the fed do have secret offshore accounts and they go through
[1:18:18.400 --> 1:18:24.240]  the american system like in the bond market and they will buy bonds and we can't tell that they're
[1:18:24.240 --> 1:18:30.160]  doing that because we can't investigate them if this bill passed we can we can find out what
[1:18:30.160 --> 1:18:37.360]  they're doing and then you run into money laundering there's all sorts of real horrible
[1:18:37.360 --> 1:18:42.240]  things are going to be exposed you think we'd find something a thousand times a hundred times worse
[1:18:42.240 --> 1:18:49.040]  than a made-off and others if we ever audited the fed bob absolutely and incidentally now that you
[1:18:49.040 --> 1:18:58.480]  bring up mr made-off uh and that's sort of that was a scam not a Ponzi scheme uh i i have to refer
[1:18:58.480 --> 1:19:08.080]  to uh mr greenberg who was the head of aig and he testified yesterday and when he essentially
[1:19:08.080 --> 1:19:16.800]  stole the stock in the company uh and put it into star investments from aig he hired a a jet
[1:19:17.440 --> 1:19:26.000]  with guards and they took the certificates of aig stock and put them in offshore accounts
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:31.200]  now you hear about these offshore accounts and you hear about the u.s. government running
[1:19:31.200 --> 1:19:37.200]  all over the place trying to find out who's got them and they don't touch top members of the
[1:19:37.200 --> 1:19:44.080]  illuminati that's right you got the big kingpins and they'll fry a few mid-level ones to pacify
[1:19:44.080 --> 1:19:48.800]  the public well meanwhile they're testifying in congress that they're stealing everything blind
[1:19:48.800 --> 1:19:52.560]  right in front of everybody that's like the pentagon when they said you got two trillion

[1:24:23.120 --> 1:24:30.480]  Bob Chapman I'm sure you saw the ACLU letter
[1:24:31.920 --> 1:24:35.600]  and even mainstream news outlets reporting the incredible headline
[1:24:37.840 --> 1:24:47.360]  all protest terrorism and another headline all acts of protest low-level terrorism all of the army
[1:24:47.360 --> 1:24:54.240]  soldiers are now being taught as part of their security training that protesting is illegal
[1:24:54.240 --> 1:25:01.120]  and anti-government anti-american you dovetail that with the dhs report saying veterans are
[1:25:01.120 --> 1:25:06.480]  terrorist gun owners are terrorist people with third party bumper stickers are terrorist i mean
[1:25:06.480 --> 1:25:14.720]  this is so outrageously un-american and tyrannical it's so patently obvious that the people
[1:25:14.720 --> 1:25:18.720]  teaching this are the terrorists i mean this is right out of the soviet union right out of
[1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:24.400]  nazi germany where do you see this going or or like you said with the scyop are they just trying to
[1:25:24.400 --> 1:25:30.640]  be so incredibly off the chart obvious with their tyranny that they think people are just going to
[1:25:30.640 --> 1:25:37.680]  accept it and go yes protesting is illegal never allowed in america well i think that
[1:25:37.680 --> 1:25:43.840]  that that's what their attention is and whether they're going to be successful or not remains to
[1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:52.000]  be seen our armed forces personnel are not stupid and they're going to say to themselves no this
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:59.120]  isn't right and 90 percent of them will think that way and so they may be making noises to condition
[1:25:59.120 --> 1:26:08.720]  people particularly in the military and people who hear about it about anybody who disagrees
[1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:14.960]  as a terrorist it's not going to be bought but it'll scare some people there's no question i mean
[1:26:14.960 --> 1:26:22.400]  you have again almost half the people in america are functionally illiterate and they'll unfortunately
[1:26:22.400 --> 1:26:27.440]  believe everything well bob i think you just hit it this is meant to be obviously tyranny
[1:26:27.440 --> 1:26:32.400]  and it's meant to make all the thinking people go whoa we really do have a tyranny i better
[1:26:32.400 --> 1:26:39.600]  shut up it's meant to be a bullying chilling effect and if we shut up and let them bully us
[1:26:39.600 --> 1:26:46.560]  then the real corruption and oppression comes in well i think you're absolutely right and that's a
[1:26:46.560 --> 1:26:52.880]  good take on it but underlying the whole thing you can see the direction that they're going in
[1:26:52.880 --> 1:27:01.440]  and that direction is toward total government and you know the every day we come up with another
[1:27:01.440 --> 1:27:07.440]  facet of what they're trying to do and you can you can imagine the many many people that they
[1:27:07.440 --> 1:27:12.640]  have planning these things i wouldn't doubt it that they had hundreds of thousands of people
[1:27:12.640 --> 1:27:20.560]  coming up with these ideas every day via the fund foundations and think tanks and within governments
[1:27:20.560 --> 1:27:26.000]  and don't forget the governments all connect with each other they all see each other the
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:33.680]  bill de berger meetings and so they're all linked together and so something an idea comes out of
[1:27:33.680 --> 1:27:40.800]  the think tank in germany and it's spread throughout all of the other aluminous conclaves
[1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:46.480]  and it becomes a project and that's where they get these things from and you know the public
[1:27:46.480 --> 1:27:53.200]  has got to understand they have an endless amount of money and they work 24 hours a day at this
[1:27:54.080 --> 1:28:00.800]  and you know you and i and people like us have a mountainous job trying to get the word to the
[1:28:00.800 --> 1:28:06.320]  public of what they're doing and why they're doing it and in this case why they're doing it again
[1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:12.720]  is conditioning they want you to think that anybody who says anything
[1:28:12.720 --> 1:28:21.120]  i'll criticize this government in any way is a terrorist unbelievable bob i've been throwing
[1:28:21.120 --> 1:28:25.120]  out my questions we're about to break and come back and go to calls but so much is happening in
[1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:29.200]  the economy and you're a guy for those that don't know who you are out there a lot of new stations
[1:28:29.200 --> 1:28:34.480]  who have just made hundreds and hundreds of accurate forecasts and predictions about the economy
[1:28:35.200 --> 1:28:39.840]  with stunning accuracy what is most important right now in the economy what some of the other
[1:28:39.840 --> 1:28:43.680]  news other people should know about about the direction of the economy and where it's going
[1:28:44.880 --> 1:28:48.560]  well i think coming up in july they're going to have a second quarter earnings and they're
[1:28:48.560 --> 1:28:54.560]  not going to be very good and i think that before the month is over that the stock market will start
[1:28:54.560 --> 1:29:01.680]  down and whether it'll go down to 6600 at this time during the summer remains to be seen but i
[1:29:01.680 --> 1:29:08.480]  think there's a good shot that we could go back to 6600 on the dow in the fall and chest it at the
[1:29:08.480 --> 1:29:15.920]  same time i see that every time gold sticks its head up they try to knock it down but the physical
[1:29:15.920 --> 1:29:22.960]  market keeps on coming through and as long as that continues gold will remain relatively strong
[1:29:22.960 --> 1:29:27.600]  all right and let's get more into that after the quick break the international forecaster.com is
[1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:33.040]  his website and a free copy of the newsletter there in the letter or the hard copy and our websites

[1:33:28.960 --> 1:33:39.520]  Bob Chapman you got cut off by the break there getting into where you see gold going you
[1:33:41.040 --> 1:33:45.600]  did predict the last three ups and downs of the stock market with amazing accuracy
[1:33:46.320 --> 1:33:52.160]  you've done a great job predicting gold you said you thought it would go up to 960 it did and passed
[1:33:52.160 --> 1:33:57.520]  that you said they'd probably push it back down a few more times throughout the summer but you and
[1:33:57.520 --> 1:34:04.000]  many others are predicting it's going to go way up what into the fall winner of next year breakdown
[1:34:04.720 --> 1:34:08.640]  looking at the tea leaves there Bob Chapman and doing this for 50 years what you think is going to
[1:34:08.640 --> 1:34:15.040]  happen with gold and silver in the short term and the long term well I think we have a good shot at
[1:34:15.040 --> 1:34:21.920]  going through a thousand before the year is out and if I had to pick a time I would say October
[1:34:21.920 --> 1:34:27.920]  would be a good one or in December for that matter and so that's the way I think it's going to go
[1:34:28.720 --> 1:34:35.280]  in spite of the inner workings and manipulation of the working group and financial markets
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:44.400]  which is a legal entity within government that does 24 hours a day manipulate all markets and
[1:34:44.400 --> 1:34:51.520]  that's another thing that will be exposed in the audit of the Federal Reserve just what they're
[1:34:51.520 --> 1:34:58.880]  doing in these markets I mean this legislation is going to be devastating it's got to pass because
[1:34:58.880 --> 1:35:07.200]  we can cut them off at the pass it is you just have no idea how important it is I call it the most
[1:35:07.200 --> 1:35:12.160]  important legislation in the last hundred years and incidentally you're going to pay it to play a
[1:35:12.160 --> 1:35:18.160]  tape by Ron Paul you said you had a two or three minute piece you wanted to play yes we do have
[1:35:18.160 --> 1:35:22.400]  that I want to get to that after we take a few calls here Bob I've got time today if you can do
[1:35:22.400 --> 1:35:27.440]  it to hold a little bit into the next hour before our in studio guests show up to get into the
[1:35:27.440 --> 1:35:32.720]  force medicating of the water supply but yes that's going to come up after we take some calls
[1:35:32.720 --> 1:35:41.600]  but specifically getting back to HR 1207 with over 230 sponsors last time I checked
[1:35:42.800 --> 1:35:46.080]  it's going to the floor in the near future incredible debates there
[1:35:46.080 --> 1:35:50.400]  uh then it's probably going to pass the house there's a good chance of that and then going to
[1:35:50.400 --> 1:35:55.840]  the Senate but as Ron Paul has said we win either way because if they fight being audited
[1:35:56.400 --> 1:36:00.800]  if they continue to say they're above the law in secret that only educates more people
[1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:04.400]  five years ago almost no one knew the Federal Reserve was private or even knew what the Federal
[1:36:04.400 --> 1:36:09.840]  Reserve was now the general public knows these are the bad guys these are the offshore banks
[1:36:09.840 --> 1:36:14.800]  and so anyway you cut it the fact that they're the illegitimate financial government has come
[1:36:14.800 --> 1:36:20.240]  out and now like you said they're trying to fail forward by becoming the entire government
[1:36:20.240 --> 1:36:24.800]  overall and bringing us under international control through this new bank of the world
[1:36:24.800 --> 1:36:29.520]  that Time Magazine and Newsweek and the Wall Street Journal are are all pushing so there's
[1:36:29.520 --> 1:36:34.160]  no more denial about the fact that there's offshore banks trying to set up a world financial
[1:36:34.160 --> 1:36:41.280]  dictatorship with physical backing the only issue is will we have a fighting spirit and stand up and
[1:36:41.280 --> 1:36:46.240]  say no uh to this attempt to take over you people say well they're not going to pass it or well
[1:36:46.240 --> 1:36:50.720]  they're going to have what they want or they're invincible no they're not look how far we've
[1:36:50.720 --> 1:36:56.080]  come i mean bob what has it been like for you 45 50 years with g edward griffin and others
[1:36:56.080 --> 1:37:01.920]  an icon in fighting this and to now see the type of traction we've got but at the same time to see
[1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:07.760]  so many snot knows people uh who don't like the new world order but saying there's nothing we can do
[1:37:07.760 --> 1:37:15.280]  i mean why don't they have a fighting spirit i think it's just human nature uh there are certain
[1:37:15.280 --> 1:37:20.560]  types of personality out there i get letters from these people and i answer them all and i'll say
[1:37:20.560 --> 1:37:26.160]  look uh if you want to give up why don't you just go commit suicide i mean to make it simpler of
[1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:30.800]  course i don't think anybody does that but i think they get the point and you know i am so
[1:37:30.800 --> 1:37:36.240]  you know i've been saying this over and over again on all the radio stations i've been on for the
[1:37:36.240 --> 1:37:43.680]  last three months pushing ron paul's agenda in relation to the federal reserve even if we had
[1:37:43.680 --> 1:37:50.400]  lost which it doesn't look like we're going to we get a shot at winning but even if we had lost
[1:37:51.040 --> 1:37:56.720]  there are millions and millions of people who now know who the enemy is and what they're up to
[1:37:57.360 --> 1:38:02.800]  absolutely and this is a process the globalist it's taken them hundreds of years to build this
[1:38:02.800 --> 1:38:07.200]  in just a few decades we are starting to tear it down so they're trying to build it and as
[1:38:07.200 --> 1:38:12.800]  they're building it we're busy removing bricks to where what they've built is a dysfunctional mess
[1:38:12.800 --> 1:38:18.400]  it's not going to work we're winning i mean resistance and the will to fight is the key
[1:38:18.400 --> 1:38:25.040]  component of victory is it not bob it certainly is and that's why i have kept for 50 years next
[1:38:25.040 --> 1:38:31.920]  year it'll be 50 years i would not give up and you know ed griffith was in the same boat along
[1:38:31.920 --> 1:38:40.480]  with alan stang and anthony j hilder and some of our pals are now deceased but uh we're going to win
[1:38:41.200 --> 1:38:47.280]  i i can feel it i know it three weeks ago at the bill de berger meeting as you know they said
[1:38:47.280 --> 1:38:52.720]  tops in the agenda we think this thing is getting out of control we had we better haul it in here
[1:38:53.360 --> 1:39:00.560]  before we're hung out to dry well the problem for them is they can't haul it in here they can't do it
[1:39:00.560 --> 1:39:05.360]  they're going to have to play it out to the end and the end for them is at the end of a rope
[1:39:06.880 --> 1:39:11.440]  amazing well it is us or them ladies and gentlemen i want to go to uh
[1:39:11.440 --> 1:39:16.800]  todd and chris and joe and randall and bill and nick and many others here uh in just a moment but
[1:39:16.800 --> 1:39:21.920]  i wanted to get like a three minute report real fast from ted anderson because gold went way up
[1:39:21.920 --> 1:39:27.520]  and it dropped some but still way up on the year uh and i wanted to bring ted up on this friday
[1:39:27.520 --> 1:39:32.400]  edition the owner of genesis communications also the owner of mitis resources and i've searched
[1:39:32.400 --> 1:39:36.160]  around for gold and silver this is where i've decided to do my shopping because they have the
[1:39:36.160 --> 1:39:41.040]  best deals they have great deals on bullion coins really collector coins at bullion prices
[1:39:41.040 --> 1:39:46.000]  and collector coins and some really good deals on collectible silver coins ted anderson good
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:50.240]  to have you here with us yeah thanks for having me up alex it's very interesting what's going on
[1:39:50.240 --> 1:39:54.400]  in the gold market you're right right now the prices are down a little bit and that just makes
[1:39:54.400 --> 1:40:00.160]  me want to buy it even more um just watching what the fed is doing and what's going on in congress
[1:40:00.160 --> 1:40:05.200]  and that hr 1207 bill if the people of the united states haven't figured it out yet
[1:40:05.200 --> 1:40:09.440]  if the united states government won't get themselves on a gold standard and silver
[1:40:09.440 --> 1:40:13.840]  then the people of the united states will do it without them and that's exactly what's going on
[1:40:13.840 --> 1:40:18.960]  a lot of people are getting interested in gold and silver coins we're seeing a great interest
[1:40:18.960 --> 1:40:25.520]  you know boil up and uh and right now literally we have even less than three percent i wouldn't
[1:40:25.520 --> 1:40:30.160]  even doubt if the numbers are less than one percent of the people are getting into gold at this time
[1:40:30.160 --> 1:40:35.200]  by the time uh five percent of the people wake up and feel that they need to have gold and silver
[1:40:35.200 --> 1:40:40.240]  as a part of their portfolio gold will be over ten thousand dollars an ounce and you know silver
[1:40:40.240 --> 1:40:46.240]  who knows will be at there maybe one fifty two hundred and uh and and they're just the supply
[1:40:46.240 --> 1:40:50.480]  is going to be so short that just won't be enough to go let me ask bob that question because uh
[1:40:50.480 --> 1:40:55.520]  i'm wanting to elaborate all these big-time analysts on mainstream tv are saying it's
[1:40:55.520 --> 1:41:02.000]  going to go above two thousand sure thing now when i start seeing mainstream excuse me media
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:04.800]  come out and say two thousand i start thinking maybe that isn't going to happen
[1:41:05.920 --> 1:41:10.640]  now when they're saying it isn't i start thinking it is i mean will gold go above two thousand
[1:41:10.640 --> 1:41:14.720]  dollars an ounce in their future uh yes i think it well and i think the reason
[1:41:14.720 --> 1:41:21.840]  and that they're doing that and that includes jp morgan chase goman sack city group and others who
[1:41:21.840 --> 1:41:28.960]  are in on this so to speak because they want to limit the increase in the price of gold
[1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:35.440]  to two thousand dollars an ounce that's why they're giving into that number now at some time in the
[1:41:35.440 --> 1:41:41.200]  future because they don't want it going any higher than that and that's what that is all about
[1:41:41.200 --> 1:41:48.560]  again psychological warfare there is the planting in people's minds that's going to be the top of
[1:41:48.560 --> 1:41:55.920]  the market it doesn't seem relative right now but it will later absolutely uh ten anderson
[1:41:55.920 --> 1:41:59.520]  and tell folks about today's specials that are going to run through the weekend and they want
[1:41:59.520 --> 1:42:03.520]  to call and start getting into gold and silver well yeah we've been trading those Lakota rounds
[1:42:03.520 --> 1:42:08.080]  for twenty one dollars i think twenty one dollars and fifty cents right around in that range here
[1:42:08.080 --> 1:42:13.440]  but because silver has dropped back from about fourteen seventy five down to about fourteen
[1:42:13.440 --> 1:42:19.280]  twenty one i've been able to offer the Lakota's back down at that twenty dollar level which is a
[1:42:19.280 --> 1:42:24.800]  really great buy i mean this is one of the coins that really flies in the face of the fed
[1:42:24.800 --> 1:42:30.400]  because you know like they're indicting the guy from norfed right now on legal trouble i just
[1:42:30.400 --> 1:42:35.440]  don't know how the united states government's going to be able to step in and tell a sovereign
[1:42:35.440 --> 1:42:40.160]  nation that they can't have a currency coin and we'll see how that plays out but obviously with
[1:42:40.160 --> 1:42:45.840]  what happened to the norfed coin uh they went up so high in price when the feds came in and and
[1:42:45.840 --> 1:42:50.880]  and did their thing with that shut that that organization down and confiscated silver which
[1:42:50.880 --> 1:42:56.880]  was funny ted i had no idea that you were going to talk about the liberty dollar when you were
[1:42:56.880 --> 1:43:00.880]  coming on the day and i was holding up a liberty dollar because i was about to talk about that
[1:43:00.880 --> 1:43:07.120]  as soon as you left us uh leave us here in a few minutes but absolutely folks get into these Lakota's
[1:43:07.120 --> 1:43:11.920]  because they're gorgeous coins and uh it may be going down the same road as the liberty dollar
[1:43:11.920 --> 1:43:15.600]  and then these suckers go for hundreds and hundreds of dollars an ounce now because they're
[1:43:15.600 --> 1:43:20.560]  now such collectors because this company got shut down land of the free home of the brave can't
[1:43:20.560 --> 1:43:25.760]  coin your own silver can't coin your own gold uh we're going to be breaking that down coming up
[1:43:25.760 --> 1:43:31.840]  a little bit uh later uh in this hour but uh ted fire out the toll free number for folks
[1:43:31.840 --> 1:43:42.000]  yeah they can get us at 1-800-686-2237 again it's 1-800-686-2237 the nice thing is is i was able
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:47.200]  to buy uh quite a supply of these Lakota coins so i can deliver them real fast and i know that
[1:43:47.200 --> 1:43:51.440]  people want to get the gold and silver in their hands i mean if you you'd be a fool right now
[1:43:51.440 --> 1:43:56.160]  to get certificates it just doesn't make sense absolutely you want to physically hold it
[1:43:56.160 --> 1:44:04.400]  800-686-2237-800-686-2237 the brokers will be there tonight and all weekend thank you ted
[1:44:04.400 --> 1:44:08.560]  yeah thanks for having me up alex you bet bob i wanted to bring this up and then go to calls
[1:44:08.560 --> 1:44:14.560]  finally uh because every few weeks i see an article about man arrested at best buy or
[1:44:14.560 --> 1:44:22.000]  man arrested at walmart or man arrested at drugstore for trying to uh pay for something with a $2
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:30.240]  bill $2 bills are federal reserve issued quote us meant issued with the declaration of independence
[1:44:30.240 --> 1:44:34.880]  on the back and the public is so ignorant and the police are so ignorant they will still take
[1:44:34.880 --> 1:44:40.240]  you to jail and charge you usually it gets dropped down the line but for those that don't know it's
[1:44:40.240 --> 1:44:46.960]  free association free barter if you're you know it's against a lot of copy us currency the federal
[1:44:46.960 --> 1:44:51.280]  reserve took that over and does that so they're really counterfeiters but if you counterfeit
[1:44:51.280 --> 1:44:56.320]  their counterfeit currency you go to jail because that debases and devalues the currency what the
[1:44:56.320 --> 1:45:01.760]  private fellow reserve is doing themselves but if i wanted to go out and strike say a thousand
[1:45:02.320 --> 1:45:08.160]  you know coins with my face on them or your face or the easter bunnies face on them uh
[1:45:08.160 --> 1:45:14.160]  uh that's my right and if somebody wants to barter and i go hey silver's 15 bucks an ounce you
[1:45:14.160 --> 1:45:21.600]  want to give me 15 bucks worth of products for this uh that would then happen and for those
[1:45:21.600 --> 1:45:26.800]  that don't know cities and counties and and all over the u.s for hundreds of years have barter
[1:45:26.800 --> 1:45:33.840]  have local notes uh the feds are now going after those groups so we see them trying to as they
[1:45:33.840 --> 1:45:38.720]  debase the federal reserve note i think getting ready for inflation and that might be discredited
[1:45:38.720 --> 1:45:43.680]  like you said currency controls not just outside currency controls trying to trade your dollars
[1:45:43.680 --> 1:45:49.760]  as they are imploded in the future but also where people can't oh i'll trade in silver my own silver
[1:45:49.760 --> 1:45:54.480]  even if it's old u.s silver or i'll trade in gold whether it's kruger rand's or british sovereigns
[1:45:54.480 --> 1:45:59.600]  or american engels or or oh our local town will do script you know that's accepted at the auto
[1:45:59.600 --> 1:46:04.240]  repair place in the beauty salon and at the grocery store i mean there's already hundreds of
[1:46:04.240 --> 1:46:10.080]  towns and cities doing this it's not illegal but the feds it says ashfield man charged an alleged
[1:46:10.080 --> 1:46:16.480]  liberty dollar fraud scheme they were advertising all over tv and radio they were mainstream they
[1:46:16.480 --> 1:46:23.040]  were just saying alternative currency system totally legal and the feds rated them and people said well
[1:46:23.920 --> 1:46:27.920]  we believe this is legal you know the news because it's legal to have your own alternate
[1:46:27.920 --> 1:46:32.880]  currencies as long as you're not saying you're the federal reserve or the treasury and they weren't
[1:46:34.400 --> 1:46:38.880]  and i said no folks they had the gold and silver on hand for their certificates as well
[1:46:38.880 --> 1:46:43.440]  and the feds aren't charging they didn't have enough gold and silver they stole that it was now in
[1:46:43.440 --> 1:46:50.240]  the indictments they admit saying this is counterfeit how is it counterfeit bob to have free association
[1:46:50.240 --> 1:46:57.920]  and make your own coins out of a precious metal and sell them whether it's commemorative or whatever
[1:46:57.920 --> 1:47:03.360]  well it isn't and i think when you see the court cases uh that the government will lose
[1:47:04.160 --> 1:47:09.520]  if the government does not lose you'll know that the courts are rigged because it's not illegal
[1:47:09.520 --> 1:47:16.160]  it's it's legal the the berkshire dollar is a good example uh it's been in existence for a long time
[1:47:16.160 --> 1:47:25.200]  uh in massachusetts particularly western massachusetts and uh you go and buy uh a dollar's worth and
[1:47:25.200 --> 1:47:32.480]  you pay 97 cents or 95 cents for the for the berkshire dollar and there's nothing wrong with that but
[1:47:32.480 --> 1:47:38.000]  they want to shut all these things down because they don't want anybody competing with the feds
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:45.520]  reserve now it's whether it's in script like berkshire or whether it's in coins that alex and bob made
[1:47:45.520 --> 1:47:53.200]  up uh with uh ron paul's face on it uh they they don't want anything like that it's dictatorial
[1:47:53.200 --> 1:47:58.560]  and you're right back to square one again well i mean take davin buster's for folks that don't
[1:47:58.560 --> 1:48:02.640]  have that in their area of the country it's a big place with three or four restaurants
[1:48:02.640 --> 1:48:09.520]  and whack-a-mole games and foosball and uh ski ball and all that stuff and you can take the kids
[1:48:09.520 --> 1:48:15.360]  there and eat dinner and then you know go spend a few bucks but you in the old days you'd get
[1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:20.240]  tokens now now you get a debit card but you put your twenty dollar bill in and then you get tokens
[1:48:20.240 --> 1:48:25.680]  that'd be like the secret service hiding out at davin buster's or an arcade arresting the arcade
[1:48:25.680 --> 1:48:32.720]  owner for giving people tokens for dollars uh i mean this is just unbelievable that this is
[1:48:32.720 --> 1:48:38.560]  happening and and and these guys were out in the open doing nothing wrong and this coin that i got
[1:48:38.560 --> 1:48:44.240]  back at the time for five dollars because i let listeners pay for videos uh with silver coin it
[1:48:44.240 --> 1:48:48.800]  just needs to be denominated you know the amount of the books and videos they buy and i've gotten
[1:48:48.800 --> 1:48:53.360]  quite a bit of silver in the mail over the years and uh these collectors items i got for five
[1:48:53.360 --> 1:48:59.760]  dollars a piece back when silver was at five bucks five six years ago this coin is worth hundreds on
[1:48:59.760 --> 1:49:04.720]  ebay so i guess i did a pretty good thing but maybe i'll be arrested bob for even having this
[1:49:04.720 --> 1:49:10.720]  because i'm in such a free country well you know that may eventually happen uh you know
[1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:16.800]  government has the ability to outlaw anything and that's why they have executive orders which i think
[1:49:16.800 --> 1:49:23.280]  should be totally done away with along with lobbying and campaign finance and uh and i have
[1:49:23.280 --> 1:49:32.080]  the solutions for them but the the the the path that we're taking here is that the government
[1:49:32.800 --> 1:49:40.640]  is going to in the future outlaw lots of things and if we have high unemployment which i think
[1:49:40.640 --> 1:49:49.680]  we will have 35 maybe 50 percent because we're already at 20 22.4 or 20.4 percent and it's not
[1:49:49.680 --> 1:49:55.280]  going to be difficult to get much higher i think the people will finally say no we're not going to
[1:49:55.280 --> 1:50:01.760]  do that and and that's where the steel will meet the brick and we're going to find out just how
[1:50:01.760 --> 1:50:08.400]  far the government's willing to go well i mean my grandmother still alive great lady she remembers
[1:50:08.400 --> 1:50:18.880]  being a little girl in uh dallas and my grandfather was from dallas as well and he remembers uh his
[1:50:18.880 --> 1:50:24.880]  daddy having to go turn in their gold wink wink and turn it all in four dollars back from the
[1:50:24.880 --> 1:50:31.360]  febble reserve and then at at half price what the government said no gold is worth this much
[1:50:31.360 --> 1:50:36.480]  and then a year later the feds doubled the price of gold and made profits and private banks
[1:50:36.480 --> 1:50:41.680]  were given that money so i guess if americans are told today to give their kids to the government
[1:50:41.680 --> 1:50:45.040]  if they told them throw your kids off a cliff they might do it we're going to come back and
[1:50:45.040 --> 1:50:50.080]  take calls for bob Chapman but here's world net daily reporting on the baltimore sun
[1:50:50.080 --> 1:50:55.520]  man arrested for using two dollar bill folks two dollar bills even fell reserve money they don't
[1:50:55.520 --> 1:51:03.200]  care they have a hunger to put you in prison we'll be right back heart disease is on the rise
[1:51:03.200 --> 1:51:07.920]  clogged arteries high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[1:51:07.920 --> 1:51:13.760]  by you but the symptoms are there loss of energy blood sugar spikes and drops poor circulation
[1:51:13.760 --> 1:51:18.800]  and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong here
[1:51:18.800 --> 1:51:24.640]  how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across america my
[1:51:24.640 --> 1:51:30.000]  and blood pressure has normalized my diabetes has totally improved everyone has told me now how much

[1:54:45.920 --> 1:54:51.120]  gentlemen I am in route to an appointment while I will become a bronze member of the police state
[1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:56.560]  control grid I'm a Texas educator Alex can you guess what I'm getting ready to go and do you're
[1:54:56.560 --> 1:55:04.800]  getting ready to go be biometrically scanned yes I am and let me tell you it it it sickens me
[1:55:04.800 --> 1:55:10.000]  the very core of my being so I've been an educator for 10 years I have literally kept kids from
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:16.320]  committing suicide and this is how I'm being repaid I've contacted my representatives I've
[1:55:16.320 --> 1:55:22.560]  contacted the ACLU I've contacted the Texas education agency and I didn't realize it but
[1:55:22.560 --> 1:55:27.200]  I really angered the director of fingerprinting and investigations when he said he was just doing
[1:55:27.200 --> 1:55:31.760]  a job and I said that was the defense they used at Nuremberg so I just thought that you know I
[1:55:31.760 --> 1:55:37.600]  commemorate this day by uh by calling in and I'll let you know well I guessed because I know that a
[1:55:37.600 --> 1:55:45.040]  lot of educators are having to do it right now to get ready for next year to start but they lie
[1:55:45.040 --> 1:55:50.160]  and say you've got to be vaccinated you don't they lie and say you've got to be fingerprinted
[1:55:50.160 --> 1:55:55.840]  it is a policy they you know they call it a law but all over the nation and all over the world
[1:55:55.840 --> 1:56:04.240]  this is being standardized and the big think tanks admit to get everybody ready to thumb print to buy
[1:56:04.240 --> 1:56:10.400]  and sell because they're gonna skip ahead of the world currency you're gonna still have regional
[1:56:10.400 --> 1:56:15.200]  currencies it's just going to all be globally standardized this is all under UN treaty already
[1:56:15.760 --> 1:56:24.400]  and so that's why you'll see a 80 year old man at Walgreens showing his ID to buy pipe tobacco
[1:56:24.400 --> 1:56:29.840]  I've seen an ancient man on the little four-ended walker barely able to get his money up to the
[1:56:29.840 --> 1:56:36.080]  counter showing his ID to the messy literally going here you go uh and because it's all about
[1:56:36.080 --> 1:56:42.000]  mindless zero tolerance enforcement oh the the 10 year old's gotten a fistfight you go to prison
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:47.840]  now you don't get in trouble uh and get swats or get sent home or get patted on the back and told
[1:56:47.840 --> 1:56:52.880]  good job boys like they're supposed to be to be men it's all about throwing the book at you and so
[1:56:52.880 --> 1:57:04.480]  CPAs lawyers uh people that are involved in real estate uh at all levels not just the brokers uh
[1:57:04.480 --> 1:57:10.800]  but also uh the real estate agents everybody's having to thumb print and digital photo they
[1:57:10.800 --> 1:57:15.760]  don't tell you it's a face scan head start comes in does it to your kids doesn't even ask you this
[1:57:15.760 --> 1:57:22.160]  is all this in their own words cashless society control grid being put in bob Chapman comments on
[1:57:22.160 --> 1:57:28.560]  this this is the federal reserve omnibus global banking scheme making the slaves only use their
[1:57:28.560 --> 1:57:34.160]  currency only use their system killing all anonymity all freedom and nothing to do with
[1:57:34.160 --> 1:57:43.280]  protecting the kids uh yes you're right and what they ultimately want is a chip or a debit card
[1:57:44.160 --> 1:57:49.840]  and if you say one thing out of the way about government uh your debit card doesn't work anymore
[1:57:49.840 --> 1:57:56.560]  and your chip shuts down and this is where they're headed with all this and by the way you know used
[1:57:56.560 --> 1:58:00.960]  to we didn't even have driver's license then we had driver's license now if you don't face print
[1:58:00.960 --> 1:58:05.920]  thumb print hand print you don't get in disney world you don't get in the sea world if you don't
[1:58:05.920 --> 1:58:12.640]  follow every order we give you you don't eat you don't have a job and now it's guilty until proven
[1:58:12.640 --> 1:58:17.920]  innocent but then the schools will keep the pedophiles working there this has nothing to do
[1:58:17.920 --> 1:58:24.080]  with that either this is about training Todd that he's a slave uh Todd what are the other teachers
[1:58:24.080 --> 1:58:28.880]  thing uh you know I have a couple people that I've worked with over the years but have slowly

[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:04.960]  totally controlling and tracking everything you do and like bob said and like nick Rockefeller said
[2:01:04.960 --> 2:01:11.280]  to Aaron Russo in the reflections and warnings film that's available by the way at info wars.com
[2:01:12.320 --> 2:01:19.360]  they said right there that hey we're going to have kiss my butt on our chips and it's going
[2:01:19.360 --> 2:01:23.520]  to be on your chip that you're a slave and they already have that in california and other states
[2:01:23.520 --> 2:01:29.200]  where the police license plates can't be read by the camera scanners that are up and the police
[2:01:29.200 --> 2:01:34.720]  can't be arrested for speeding or drunk driving or driving through toll roads just like illegal
[2:01:34.720 --> 2:01:43.360]  aliens are selectively left alone so finishing up real quick Todd yes you were wanting to finish
[2:01:43.360 --> 2:01:47.680]  up Todd about I'm actually I'm actually in the building right now we're about to be processed
[2:01:47.680 --> 2:01:52.000]  into the system I'm sorry I'm a little bit distracted so I am actually here in the building
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:56.560]  and uh yes the police state has come to the tiny town of Robstown Texas population 12,000 no
[2:01:56.560 --> 2:02:01.280]  no town is exempt no town will be free everyone will be processed and it's a biometric scanner
[2:02:01.280 --> 2:02:06.080]  you're going to go right into the international slave database just like how old are you Tom
[2:02:07.040 --> 2:02:18.000]  Todd I'm 34 well then I'm 30 yet 30 uh hold him I'm 35 now anyways uh going back here
[2:02:19.040 --> 2:02:22.320]  no but the point I was going to make is the point I was going to make is
[2:02:23.040 --> 2:02:28.560]  everybody at birth who's 36 years old or younger had their bloody legally taken
[2:02:28.560 --> 2:02:33.920]  and put in a world DNA database I said that for years people laughed at me now it's mainstream
[2:02:33.920 --> 2:02:38.800]  news let's go back to Bob Chapman Bob I mean again is this a good government we have that
[2:02:38.800 --> 2:02:47.360]  took everybody's blood at birth in the last 36 years it's dreadful and obviously so I remember
[2:02:48.160 --> 2:02:55.440]  my son is 41 and I remember we had a birthday party for him we lived in California
[2:02:55.440 --> 2:03:00.640]  and an ice cream place and all the kids who were going to school with him it was the the
[2:03:00.640 --> 2:03:09.360]  sort of thing that kids did in those days and I found out later that the the government came in
[2:03:09.360 --> 2:03:15.680]  to that company which had a number of ice ice cream parlors throughout southern California
[2:03:16.320 --> 2:03:22.160]  and retrieved all of the information on all of the kids and what their birth date dates were
[2:03:22.160 --> 2:03:31.520]  and in all the information they could get on them and when he was 21 or 18 they sent him a notice
[2:03:31.520 --> 2:03:37.360]  to register for the draft based on that because there was a mistake in it and the mistake had
[2:03:37.360 --> 2:03:42.480]  been on the original which was turned in for that party so that's the kind of things your
[2:03:42.480 --> 2:03:47.920]  government does and they've been doing it for years and incidentally my daughter's a teacher
[2:03:47.920 --> 2:03:54.000]  here and she's going to have to come to terms with this stupidness that the government's doing
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:04:02.960]  in relation to teachers amazing yeah I mean think about it in Australia UK Canada all over
[2:04:02.960 --> 2:04:08.240]  the western world for 36 years is when it started everywhere they had some pilot programs the
[2:04:08.240 --> 2:04:12.320]  austrian american statesman a couple months ago said for 44 years they've been taking your blood
[2:04:12.320 --> 2:04:20.960]  at birth the documents I have were 36 but when I was born at Parkland in 1974 35 years ago they came
[2:04:20.960 --> 2:04:26.960]  in and took my blood they came in and did it and sent it off to a UN database I mean you know
[2:04:28.080 --> 2:04:32.720]  this is a rogue government period bob and we've got to get the public to come with grips with that
[2:04:32.720 --> 2:04:37.040]  we've got to stop cooperating they know we're going to stop cooperating that's why they want this
[2:04:37.040 --> 2:04:42.720]  casual society great in place do you agree absolutely and all the other things that they're trying to
[2:04:42.720 --> 2:04:50.160]  do to get rid of the people like you and I who will speak out about what they're doing well I

[2:08:55.600 --> 2:09:00.640]  smuggle them into switzerland and it appears somehow that they've taken these bonds from the
[2:09:00.640 --> 2:09:07.040]  japanese treasurer treasury and uh... they've got north korea kim john ill has them do you think
[2:09:07.040 --> 2:09:12.400]  this large amount of debt is the reason why we're involved with our conflict with north korea today
[2:09:12.400 --> 2:09:17.520]  and what will this do it says it puts dollar on edge will this finally be the last straw to break
[2:09:17.520 --> 2:09:23.280]  the yeah i saw that report we we actually know if they transfer them to euros we actually mentioned
[2:09:23.280 --> 2:09:27.840]  that yesterday but i wanted to get bob's take on that for those that don't know about a bob tell him
[2:09:29.120 --> 2:09:35.520]  well uh... the italian border police uh... at an entry point uh... into switzerland
[2:09:36.160 --> 2:09:43.200]  intercepted uh... to japanese men with false bottoms in their uh... attache cases
[2:09:43.200 --> 2:09:47.920]  uh... which contained a hundred and thirty four billion dollars worth of bonds
[2:09:48.800 --> 2:09:55.120]  uh... i have i'm hearing all kinds of differing stories out of europe as as opposed to here
[2:09:55.920 --> 2:10:03.120]  i don't know what the answer is yet uh... chances are that they may be counterfeits
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:10.320]  uh... i got a story right out of italy today that said uh... it was the japanese wukasa along
[2:10:10.320 --> 2:10:17.120]  with the italian mafia who were involved in this uh... i don't know what to believe yet
[2:10:17.120 --> 2:10:22.800]  all i know is so far it isn't very good uh... for the united states government
[2:10:22.800 --> 2:10:29.120]  on the other hand uh... if they're criminals they may be counterfeits if you know the government
[2:10:29.120 --> 2:10:34.720]  never tells us the truth so we we don't know what we're going to get in the end yeah this is the
[2:10:34.720 --> 2:10:38.240]  issue i want to throw out when we've got these made-offs and all these other criminals
[2:10:38.240 --> 2:10:42.640]  uh... running the architecture of the system that's why there's no audit of the private
[2:10:42.640 --> 2:10:48.320]  federal reserve can you can can we even imagine the types of money laundering and payoffs and
[2:10:49.120 --> 2:10:56.880]  insider trading and scams uh... that we're going to find it'll be colossal uh... the hiding of
[2:10:56.880 --> 2:11:04.800]  offshore accounts uh... that the fed in the treasury are both using uh... to buy uh... bonds
[2:11:04.800 --> 2:11:11.600]  and in our domestic market here uh... the money laundering that's going on uh... the narcotics
[2:11:11.600 --> 2:11:19.520]  money uh... not only via the cia and m i six but other organizations i mean if this this goes
[2:11:19.520 --> 2:11:26.240]  the the consequences are enormous that's why this legislation is so important
[2:11:26.240 --> 2:11:33.440]  uh... good point caller uh... i really appreciate you calling it making that point anything else
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:40.640]  that we're going to let him go thank you so much chris joe in new yorker on the air with bob
[2:11:40.640 --> 2:11:44.960]  chappan go ahead hey alex and bob thanks for all you do um i just want to tell you about
[2:11:44.960 --> 2:11:48.960]  something i found out about yesterday uh... this guy at work where they keep giving them dvds we
[2:11:48.960 --> 2:11:52.560]  keep talking but he told me yesterday he's got he's got two cousins one of them lives here in
[2:11:52.560 --> 2:11:57.360]  rochester new york the other ones on california the guy in rochester new york was out in california
[2:11:57.360 --> 2:12:02.640]  for two weeks training for this company is called cbsv and he said they're looking for some people
[2:12:02.640 --> 2:12:06.160]  you know that they want to hire to recruit these people that work for him so he goes give him a
[2:12:06.160 --> 2:12:13.200]  call so i call the guy cbsv stands for consent based social security number verification he said
[2:12:13.200 --> 2:12:17.840]  it was supposed to go and they've been working on this since fec january 2008 it's going to take
[2:12:17.840 --> 2:12:22.160]  effect next month he said that their um the website's not up and running yet but it will be in a
[2:12:22.160 --> 2:12:27.200]  month and he said get you know he's got my number ticket up his cell phone and he said that if you
[2:12:27.200 --> 2:12:33.440]  want some information right now you can google google um red flag rules or red flag compliance
[2:12:34.160 --> 2:12:39.440]  and uh it's just like again it's called cbsv consent based social security number verification
[2:12:39.440 --> 2:12:43.680]  it's going to be all used in all every bank in every hospital's going to have this and uh just
[2:12:43.680 --> 2:12:47.600]  want to get your take you know i'm just trying to find out more about for those that don't know
[2:12:47.600 --> 2:12:52.160]  no i'm aware of it i'm glad you brought it up they're federalizing forcibly all health care
[2:12:52.720 --> 2:12:59.360]  they are federalizing all the major corporations the federal reserve is taking them over forcibly
[2:13:00.080 --> 2:13:05.680]  they're using their regulatory power to grab healthy banks insurance companies credit unions and
[2:13:05.680 --> 2:13:13.440]  feed it into the gaping mouth of this system and yes uh they're federalizing all the health care
[2:13:13.440 --> 2:13:19.760]  everything all the data everything you do point of transaction will be run through the feds and
[2:13:19.760 --> 2:13:26.400]  homeland security is said if you're not in good favor with them you're not going to be allowed
[2:13:26.400 --> 2:13:32.400]  to have a job if you have bad credit you're going to be on a no fly list uh they're now saying if
[2:13:32.400 --> 2:13:36.640]  you're on a no fly list you won't be able to own a firearm uh and they're going to expand that to
[2:13:36.640 --> 2:13:42.480]  tens of millions not just millions of americans and so this is the new control grid where they have
[2:13:42.480 --> 2:13:48.960]  these warrantless kafka esker 1984 list people always ask about red and blue lists and those are
[2:13:48.960 --> 2:13:54.960]  real but they also have this harassment list this list of where your prasada nong rata and can't
[2:13:54.960 --> 2:14:00.400]  travel can't live can't eat and so then you're homeless then you're not allowed to be homeless
[2:14:00.400 --> 2:14:05.280]  they take you to the camp i told people that over a decade ago now in california and hawaii they don't
[2:14:05.280 --> 2:14:12.640]  let you be homeless they take you to a camp uh so bob chappan your take on that it's absolutely
[2:14:12.640 --> 2:14:18.960]  unbelievable but it's happening and you're going to see more and more and more of this it's just
[2:14:18.960 --> 2:14:26.080]  the government take over the people and the loss of freedom that's involved and all we can do is
[2:14:26.080 --> 2:14:32.880]  what we can do but alex you know your program is bringing all this information out to public
[2:14:32.880 --> 2:14:37.760]  and at least people can be aware of it and know what's going on well for those that
[2:14:38.640 --> 2:14:42.400]  are just tuning in for the first time this is classical tyranny with the high tech
[2:14:43.200 --> 2:14:51.280]  interweaving or overlay and they attack us all incrementally they attack us individually
[2:14:51.280 --> 2:14:57.200]  and we've been trained not to know our neighbors not to get involved not to help to all be isolated
[2:14:57.200 --> 2:15:01.360]  and it's because we're isolated they're able to do this we have to first stand up and say
[2:15:01.360 --> 2:15:07.760]  i'm mad i'm angry your criminals we're going to expose you we're saying no and get on the
[2:15:07.760 --> 2:15:13.280]  offensive and call for their audit their arrest instead of just laying here while they do that
[2:15:13.280 --> 2:15:17.360]  thank you joe bill in florida you're on the air with bob chappan the international forecaster
[2:15:17.360 --> 2:15:23.120]  dot com yes well first alex i wanted to tell you thank you for everything you're doing out here
[2:15:23.120 --> 2:15:28.480]  i subscribe to your prisonplanetv.com i also picked up your bob minniception and you're
[2:15:28.480 --> 2:15:34.160]  a russell god bless you we couldn't operate without people like you i also have a problem
[2:15:34.160 --> 2:15:39.520]  of course with waking up my family it's like a joke and the other thing i wanted to say uh
[2:15:40.240 --> 2:15:45.040]  i speak out i put i post videos all the time speaking out and i promote your stuff as well
[2:15:45.760 --> 2:15:51.360]  and i had a question uh on the food you really think gold's going to be any good about they
[2:15:51.360 --> 2:15:56.240]  use food as a weapon against people well look i've always said i believe gold's a good investment
[2:15:56.240 --> 2:16:01.680]  it has intrinsic industrial value and barter value for six thousand years and also we got
[2:16:01.680 --> 2:16:06.640]  to fund this operation so i promote it i mean i i only promote things i believe in uh so it's a
[2:16:06.640 --> 2:16:11.520]  win-win-win and i believe in golden silver and people that invested in it have made three four
[2:16:11.520 --> 2:16:16.640]  times their investment when all other investments aren't doing well i know big banks and brokerage
[2:16:16.640 --> 2:16:21.760]  firms and insurance companies are quietly moving into golden silver i know the elites hoard golden
[2:16:21.760 --> 2:16:28.240]  silver but no i'm not saying just golden silver i'm saying have storable food number one water
[2:16:28.240 --> 2:16:35.360]  filter second amendment then if you have discretionary other assets put a portion of it in golden
[2:16:35.360 --> 2:16:41.280]  silver uh and not even as an investment but as an insurance policy uh i've always said invest in it
[2:16:41.280 --> 2:16:46.320]  because it can't be fully reduced overnight people say well then they could come enforceably confiscated
[2:16:46.320 --> 2:16:51.040]  they could come take you and take you to a gulag too that's the whole point is we're doing whatever
[2:16:51.040 --> 2:16:56.960]  we can to be independent to to be in their system but out of their system to be in babelon but not
[2:16:56.960 --> 2:17:05.040]  of babelon uh look bob chairman you want to explain this to him you only can do what you can do
[2:17:05.040 --> 2:17:10.960]  you lay the groundwork you get the food the filter the weapons and extra money goes into
[2:17:10.960 --> 2:17:15.920]  golden silver coins if you want to speculate you can buy the stocks as well it all depends on how
[2:17:15.920 --> 2:17:21.520]  much money you've got and that's the starting point but there's some people that can't do anything
[2:17:21.520 --> 2:17:27.280]  because they don't have the money to do it well you just do what you can do but government can
[2:17:27.280 --> 2:17:33.680]  do anything at once the longer they wait the better it is for us and the reason why is we're
[2:17:33.680 --> 2:17:39.760]  informing more people uh hopefully we can get legislation passed on the fed hopefully that'll
[2:17:39.760 --> 2:17:48.560]  be uh followed by legislation on the elimination of free trade and the implementation of tariffs
[2:17:48.560 --> 2:17:55.200]  on goods and services uh we're gaining time here they're gaining time too to do the things that
[2:17:55.200 --> 2:18:02.080]  they want to do but yeah they want this exactly they want this financial straightjacket on us
[2:18:02.080 --> 2:18:08.240]  so they can then use finance to control us with with just a backup of paramilitary force uh
[2:18:08.240 --> 2:18:12.400]  that's why we've got a scream bloody murder now and point because they don't have their grid in
[2:18:12.400 --> 2:18:19.840]  place do they bob no they don't and they're afraid as we heart back to the meeting uh of the builder
[2:18:19.840 --> 2:18:25.840]  burgers and grease recently and they said we're losing control we we got a fold this thing in
[2:18:25.840 --> 2:18:33.200]  soon because our try again later because the the people know too much it hasn't worked out the way
[2:18:33.200 --> 2:18:39.920]  we wanted a rack with it was an absolute disaster for them and they said that themselves brazil
[2:18:39.920 --> 2:18:47.280]  brazinski said that a couple of years ago if not longer and uh so we got a good shot at this
[2:18:47.280 --> 2:18:52.960]  but you gotta be prepared so if you have the funds get the fundamentals and get them in place
[2:18:53.600 --> 2:18:58.800]  and people who have more money who have questions that need answered all they have to do is email

[2:25:02.160 --> 2:25:06.000]  which they promised back in october give us more power and we'll fix it and i told you
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:10.160]  they've already been given unlimited financial power now they want power over other corporations
[2:25:10.160 --> 2:25:14.880]  and companies to seize any company take over anything they want and it's the same thing
[2:25:14.880 --> 2:25:22.160]  across the board shutting down farms and ranches in ais premises id i mean this is a corporate
[2:25:22.160 --> 2:25:28.320]  takeover of every level of society then there's some big iran news i haven't gotten to that's
[2:25:28.320 --> 2:25:33.840]  clearly a cia operation first few days i said we'll wait and see the moolas do we have some
[2:25:33.840 --> 2:25:38.800]  corrupt problems they may have stolen the election definitely cia op now they've been
[2:25:38.800 --> 2:25:42.640]  caught doing that in fact i meant to get to it yesterday but now even more evidence has come
[2:25:42.640 --> 2:25:48.400]  out can you guys uh during the break i'll find the photos for you where they would crop photos of
[2:25:48.400 --> 2:25:54.720]  people protesting for akmed denigide and they would say it was people against him and bbc got
[2:25:54.720 --> 2:25:59.920]  caught doing that they've had to admit they've staged it but that's not it they're always on tv
[2:25:59.920 --> 2:26:06.640]  with the signs in english and people have been picking them out as cia people from the us just
[2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:11.360]  like when they tore saddam statue down they show close shots of five or six guys like it was a
[2:26:11.360 --> 2:26:17.200]  crowd it turns out it was just a few dozen people and it was all cia ops we're not saying the moolas
[2:26:17.200 --> 2:26:24.000]  are good or saddam's good the issue is it's staged just just know they're lying to you on the news
[2:26:24.800 --> 2:26:32.320]  and uh trying to overthrow iran just our government already did that in 53 to these poor people no
[2:26:32.320 --> 2:26:38.000]  wonder they hate us so much stay out of their business people are like no i'll kill them i
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:44.160]  like being an empire the same empire is raping you too you're not part of the empire you pay for it
[2:26:44.160 --> 2:26:50.400]  you're the slave that pays for it you're a slave working in a factory for the new world order
[2:26:51.120 --> 2:26:56.080]  stop thinking like you're part of it huh these yuppies just can't figure it out these good old
[2:26:56.080 --> 2:27:02.800]  boys just can't figure it out let's play ron paul here he is is your perspective that tim geithner
[2:27:02.800 --> 2:27:07.760]  needs to dramatically uh change his approach at this point we've seen paul krugman and other
[2:27:07.760 --> 2:27:12.000]  economists say the worst thing that could happen right now is for the government to ease up on
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:17.680]  the stimulus and other things that it could lead to another crash what are your thoughts well it would
[2:27:17.680 --> 2:27:21.680]  be good to stimulate the economy but you don't stimulate it by doing the same thing we've done
[2:27:21.680 --> 2:27:28.000]  for 20 years and uh the the policies that gave us our trouble it can hardly be the solution so
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:33.120]  spending more money and borrowing more money and inflating the currency uh it will not solve the
[2:27:33.120 --> 2:27:37.120]  problem they're they're making the assumption that was a lack of regulations that caused our
[2:27:37.120 --> 2:27:45.280]  trouble and yet we had banking regulators and we had sec regulators and fdic regulators we had a
[2:27:45.280 --> 2:27:50.000]  ton of regulations and they failed so they say well we just need more it's sort of like what the
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:56.080]  outcome of uh of enron was we we passed sarbanes oxley now they're trying to repeal sarbanes oxley
[2:27:56.080 --> 2:28:00.880]  because it contributed to the problems of the other part of this decade so i would say they're on the
[2:28:00.880 --> 2:28:07.760]  wrong course and uh to me it's very very disturbing that they have no confidence in the free market
[2:28:07.760 --> 2:28:13.280]  and they have no interest whatsoever looking at the root cause and the root cause is easy credit
[2:28:13.280 --> 2:28:18.800]  artificially low interest rates inflating the currency excessive spending excessive debt too
[2:28:18.800 --> 2:28:24.480]  much taxes and they're going in the wrong direction and believe me there's reason for the polls to
[2:28:24.480 --> 2:28:30.240]  start to be shifting away from the administration because they're digging a bigger hole for us
[2:28:30.240 --> 2:28:35.520]  um but congressman paul the first thing you the first thing you said in that line was easy credit
[2:28:35.520 --> 2:28:40.720]  and are you not at all concerned with the role for example that some of the credit rating agencies
[2:28:40.720 --> 2:28:46.000]  played in that which in part allowed people to a get more access to credit i don't just mean
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:50.320]  individuals but i mean large corporations um are you not at all concerned that some of the
[2:28:50.320 --> 2:28:56.400]  regulations weren't well enforced well uh what you're trying to say is the regulations could
[2:28:56.400 --> 2:29:01.120]  compensate for the easy credit it wasn't the regulators who created the credit it was the
[2:29:01.120 --> 2:29:05.760]  federal reserve that pumps up the money supply and artificially lowers the interest rates
[2:29:05.760 --> 2:29:10.000]  and then the regulators are supposed to come in and adjust you might say the housing bubble
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:15.040]  should have been stopped by the regulators but congress and the regulators actually forced
[2:29:15.040 --> 2:29:20.400]  some of these uh subpar loans they they had to give loans with no down payments and notice
[2:29:20.400 --> 2:29:25.600]  that was involved with the regulator so the regulators failed because the system of regulations
[2:29:25.600 --> 2:29:30.960]  can't possibly compensate for the errors that are made by the federal reserve and creating a
[2:29:30.960 --> 2:29:36.320]  monetary system that is just not stable at all congressman paul i want to bring in my colleague
[2:29:36.320 --> 2:29:41.680]  chuck todd who's the uh who's the political director for nbc just in general we'll be right

[2:32:09.200 --> 2:32:14.400]  electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[2:32:14.400 --> 2:32:18.960]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[2:32:18.960 --> 2:32:24.000]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[2:32:24.000 --> 2:32:28.720]  dangerously overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane
[2:32:28.720 --> 2:32:33.280]  and dangerous summer storm season is here again every year thousands of families lose their power
[2:32:33.280 --> 2:32:38.080]  from weather related outages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[2:32:38.080 --> 2:32:42.800]  insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[2:33:15.120 --> 2:33:18.880]  in constant sorrow
[2:33:18.880 --> 2:33:23.840]  this day
[2:33:28.560 --> 2:33:33.040]  all right we're going to finish up this quick ron paul clip i get to the key point where he
[2:33:33.040 --> 2:33:38.000]  explains that it's the federal reserve to put out all this fiat currency and credit and that
[2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:44.960]  they are going to get more power than congress through this new quote overhaul of regulation
[2:33:44.960 --> 2:33:49.600]  giving the banks unlimited power when they've engineered this crisis that that's supposedly
[2:33:49.600 --> 2:33:54.880]  their answer give the people that did this more power thinking the public and congress are stupid
[2:33:54.880 --> 2:33:59.840]  not knowing the federal reserve is a private holding company for the big uh central banks
[2:33:59.840 --> 2:34:04.640]  here it is regulation right now you say you want to get rid of some of this stuff but obviously
[2:34:04.640 --> 2:34:09.600]  they're needed there was some missing regulation maybe the sec didn't have enough uh correct people
[2:34:09.600 --> 2:34:16.480]  there so you know what where do you where do you regulate well it what your statement says is it
[2:34:16.480 --> 2:34:21.920]  proves regulation didn't work or that was misdirected the regulations should be on the federal reserve
[2:34:21.920 --> 2:34:25.760]  we should have transparency of the federal reserve they can create trillions of dollars
[2:34:25.760 --> 2:34:30.960]  to bail out their friends and we don't even have any transparency of this they're more powerful
[2:34:30.960 --> 2:34:35.600]  than the congress so yeah but isn't this improving regulation but isn't the treasury isn't the
[2:34:35.600 --> 2:34:40.000]  treasury second i mean one thing about this new plan that's enough is that they actually do want
[2:34:40.000 --> 2:34:43.360]  to try you can read our key stories we've been screaming this for the last three days since
[2:34:43.360 --> 2:34:48.720]  they made this legislation public and now we have the headline ron paul slams federal reserves new
[2:34:48.720 --> 2:34:53.120]  dictatorial powers they can already steal all the money they want and have no one audit them unless
[2:34:53.120 --> 2:35:00.560]  we change the law now they're going to be able to seize any company or corporation i mean this is
[2:35:00.560 --> 2:35:06.400]  hit larian is the only way uh to properly uh describe the full the full magnitude of this so
[2:35:06.400 --> 2:35:10.160]  we're going to continue to cover that i'm going to get under paul correct roberts on to talk about
[2:35:10.160 --> 2:35:15.600]  this and his investigation of what's really happening in iran and north korea coming up this
[2:35:15.600 --> 2:35:24.160]  sunday four to six p.m with the sunday syndicated uh transmission now coming up in about uh 30 minutes
[2:35:24.160 --> 2:35:29.680]  we're going to have two people in studio but right now we have a dr neal carman and he is a
[2:35:29.680 --> 2:35:37.600]  phd in biology uh and uh also in several other areas and we really appreciate uh him coming
[2:35:37.600 --> 2:35:43.600]  on biology and chemistry because he works with some of the local uh anti fluoride groups are
[2:35:43.600 --> 2:35:49.280]  trying to expose what this catchall term really means like fluoride free austin dot com and ray
[2:35:49.280 --> 2:35:56.240]  nadler uh olnik who's also going to be in studio with us uh coming up uh but uh doctor first off
[2:35:56.240 --> 2:36:00.080]  tell us about yourself how you got involved in this and then you've got the documents from the
[2:36:00.080 --> 2:36:05.360]  city of austin where they get this fluoride what it really is there's thousands of government
[2:36:05.360 --> 2:36:10.640]  reports i've had top epa scientists themselves the majority of them signed letters saying please
[2:36:10.640 --> 2:36:16.960]  take this out it's deadly they know it gives uh bone cancer especially men i mean i consider
[2:36:16.960 --> 2:36:22.880]  in rand ray that it calcifies and all the organs but but but i mean you're a phd uh in mainly plant
[2:36:22.880 --> 2:36:28.560]  biology but you also study uh what's happening uh with mammals as well and can really speak to this
[2:36:28.560 --> 2:36:33.920]  so so uh it's great to have you here with us doc thank you alex you bet uh well the concerns i have
[2:36:33.920 --> 2:36:40.560]  is i worked in laboratories for a long time and uh it's well known that uh fluoride uh is a very
[2:36:40.560 --> 2:36:47.840]  toxic substance it's been known since about 1900 that fluorine in various forms uh whether it's
[2:36:47.840 --> 2:36:55.600]  industrial chemical such as they're adding to the uh austin's uh water supply uh or even some
[2:36:55.600 --> 2:37:02.000]  naturally occurring fluorides uh have a certain degree of toxicity to humans animals and plants
[2:37:02.800 --> 2:37:08.400]  and so this has been known worldwide for a long time there's actually a journal fluoride that is
[2:37:08.400 --> 2:37:16.400]  devoted to the toxicology and the health problems worldwide uh that different cultures have with
[2:37:16.400 --> 2:37:22.720]  naturally occurring fluorides but we also have industrial fluorides uh that are produced to use
[2:37:23.440 --> 2:37:29.840]  in the um refining industry to make coyote and gasoline uh and the cracking of the oil
[2:37:29.840 --> 2:37:36.160]  yes and and those facilities uh when they use fluoride rather than uh oh they use hydrofluoric
[2:37:36.160 --> 2:37:41.680]  acid rather than sulfuric acid it is the worst case accidentals and release scenario from those
[2:37:41.680 --> 2:37:48.320]  types of facilities it's used in the computer industry to set silicon chips because it eats
[2:37:48.880 --> 2:37:55.760]  hydrofluoric acid in this case will actually eat glass it eats concrete it's a very corrosive
[2:37:55.760 --> 2:38:01.760]  acidic material um and so the reason i'm very concerned about the city of austin and many
[2:38:01.760 --> 2:38:09.520]  other cities in the u.s. adding fluoride to the water is because they're adding an industrial
[2:38:09.520 --> 2:38:15.200]  hazardous waste byproduct of the phosphate fertilizer industry and much of it comes from
[2:38:15.200 --> 2:38:21.840]  florida where they do strip mining for the phosphate rock and fluorine is a very common
[2:38:21.840 --> 2:38:27.760]  element in the environment it's more common than carbon so there is a lot of fluorine out there
[2:38:27.760 --> 2:38:33.840]  but in the process of mining and processing this phosphate rock to make phosphate fertilizer
[2:38:33.840 --> 2:38:40.000]  they must remove the fluoride because it would be harmful it would kill the crops if they left it
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:46.400]  in their phosphate fertilizers so they remove it and they have wet scrubbers in several of these
[2:38:47.120 --> 2:38:53.680]  fertilizer manufacturing plants in florida and then they produced a waste with this uh fluoride
[2:38:53.680 --> 2:38:59.600]  in it and the product that the city buys from a chemical company in florida that gets it from
[2:38:59.600 --> 2:39:05.840]  these phosphate fertilizer plants is hydrofluorosilic acid okay we're going to go over what that is
[2:39:05.840 --> 2:39:10.880]  because i've had other scientists and doctors on and it was that famous dentist who got canada
[2:39:10.880 --> 2:39:15.120]  20 years ago floridated and then he went oh my god i thought this was calcium fluoride which a
[2:39:15.120 --> 2:39:21.520]  little bit of it is good for you uh no this this is even sodium fluoride this is a catchall for a
[2:39:21.520 --> 2:39:26.560]  whole bunch of toxic waste they just dump and it goes back of course for those that don't know
[2:39:26.560 --> 2:39:32.880]  uh that the manhattan project they first had to secretly because they didn't want spies uh being
[2:39:32.880 --> 2:39:36.320]  able to tell what they were doing by what was being shipped out so they started in tennessee
[2:39:36.320 --> 2:39:42.480]  in other areas dumping the different fluoride byproducts uh from purifying the uranium into
[2:39:42.480 --> 2:39:47.200]  the rivers and they found hey we can do this and it doesn't kill all the fish right away if we don't
[2:39:47.200 --> 2:39:52.560]  make it obvious so they said what do we do with all this toxic waste of aluminum fertilizer uh
[2:39:52.560 --> 2:39:58.560]  uranium plutonium purification uh what we'll put it in the water just like to put a uranium
[2:39:58.560 --> 2:40:02.240]  they had all this leftover from the nuclear industry so they said we'll make it a weapon
[2:40:02.240 --> 2:40:06.320]  system and we'll just say it's good for you and not a problem and so now they're even putting it
[2:40:06.320 --> 2:40:11.600]  in construction materials so what they're doing is is dosing poison out kind of like our ancestors
[2:40:11.600 --> 2:40:16.800]  5 000 years ago would just dump toxic waste right in the river and let somebody handle it downstream
[2:40:16.800 --> 2:40:20.720]  now they put it directly into the water but listen i'm not a chemist i'm not a
[2:40:20.720 --> 2:40:25.040]  degreed scientist biologist like you are in chemistry and biology but i know this
[2:40:25.760 --> 2:40:30.560]  when it rains on my yard the grass goes crazy and turns bright green the plants are happy when i
[2:40:30.560 --> 2:40:35.760]  when it's a drought and i've got a water plants myself the grass turns yellow they don't even
[2:40:35.760 --> 2:40:42.880]  like water hose uh city water so i'm no scientist but i know in any gardener i know says collect
[2:40:42.880 --> 2:40:49.440]  rainwater whatever don't water your plants with it if i put a goldfish in tap water it will die
[2:40:49.440 --> 2:40:55.760]  by the next day uh so i've got to put chemicals in it or or or get a purified water to put my
[2:40:55.760 --> 2:41:02.640]  kid's goldfish in so why am i drinking it well uh a fluoride is being added to the water out of
[2:41:02.640 --> 2:41:09.280]  this claim from the 1940s and the 1950s that's really based on bad science that it would help
[2:41:09.280 --> 2:41:15.120]  uh children primarily prevent tooth decay as they're developing but they knew there was a tradeoff
[2:41:15.120 --> 2:41:20.640]  and that is that about 10 percent of the children would develop a condition known as dental fluorosis
[2:41:20.640 --> 2:41:28.000]  which is a staining a brown discoloration of the teeth that uh is not very attractive plus bone
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:34.400]  fractures bone fractures yes because uh fluoride uh actually the fluorine will replace calcium in
[2:41:34.400 --> 2:41:40.960]  the bone so you get uh the bones becoming more brittle and it uh can aggravate people with
[2:41:40.960 --> 2:41:46.240]  osteoarthritis uh and so and this isn't debated it's all admitted so when i interrupted you
[2:41:46.240 --> 2:41:51.600]  don't get back into that doc you started getting into what the chemical is they're putting what
[2:41:51.600 --> 2:41:56.000]  this catch-all term is and and uh then tell us about this particular document i want to give
[2:41:56.000 --> 2:42:02.560]  people a close-up of you got from the city of austin yes uh we have a contract information and also
[2:42:02.560 --> 2:42:09.360]  a copy of the material safety data sheet uh and there's one from mosaic uh which is the
[2:42:09.360 --> 2:42:15.840]  manufacturer of the uh chemical and then also it's actually sold through a a kind of a front
[2:42:15.840 --> 2:42:21.120]  company called lucere chemical industries in florida but they admit to the city and the city
[2:42:21.120 --> 2:42:27.840]  told us yesterday that they get it from mosaic mosaic is a merger of cargill and imc global
[2:42:27.840 --> 2:42:33.440]  which both operate large phosphate fertilizer uh manufacturing plants and do the strip mining of
[2:42:33.440 --> 2:42:38.480]  the phosphate rock in florida and this is just distillate crap they'd have to pay to store in
[2:42:38.480 --> 2:42:43.760]  the desert instead they give it to us well it's actually a classified by the environmental protection
[2:42:43.760 --> 2:42:51.280]  agency has a hazardous industrial waste that they can't put into the water the rivers because it would
[2:42:51.280 --> 2:42:56.400]  be too toxic uh they they're not supposed to dump it on the land they can't put it into the air
[2:42:56.400 --> 2:43:02.960]  because it's so harmful and so they sell it uh to the cities to put uh in in small amounts they claim
[2:43:02.960 --> 2:43:07.680]  and by the way other scientists i've had on have made the point fluoride and it's in it's in it's
[2:43:07.680 --> 2:43:12.960]  different permutations is one of the hardest things to get through to filter to stop and
[2:43:12.960 --> 2:43:18.800]  that it in the aggregate builds up in your yard in your body in your house this is hellish it's a
[2:43:18.800 --> 2:43:25.040]  bio cumulative uh poison oh that's the word yes bio accumulates and so this is one of the things
[2:43:25.040 --> 2:43:29.360]  that the city uh and and other municipalities around the country don't take into account
[2:43:29.360 --> 2:43:36.880]  is that uh fluoride is bio cumulative but this is a toxic industrial waste that the public uh in the
[2:43:36.880 --> 2:43:43.520]  u.s. is is not aware is being added to the water supply compared to the natural fluoride mineral
[2:43:43.520 --> 2:43:48.640]  salts that are in the water but at at lower concentrations and by the way it says on here
[2:43:48.640 --> 2:43:52.960]  for the workers dumping this in the water don't touch this it'll burn you it'll kill you it's
[2:43:52.960 --> 2:43:57.520]  deadly just make sure they drink it and it'll actually uh these fluoride compounds actually
[2:43:57.520 --> 2:44:04.960]  will penetrate the skin they're they're very toxic well i i mean just studying nerve gases
[2:44:04.960 --> 2:44:09.920]  that the military developed most of them are fluoride based so i don't understand how they're
[2:44:09.920 --> 2:44:16.400]  putting in our water well uh that was kind of uh it's bad science it's uh whatever you want to
[2:44:16.400 --> 2:44:23.840]  call it but uh there's no epidemiological studies uh where you've had a fluoridated community on
[2:44:23.840 --> 2:44:29.120]  these specific uh industrial waste products uh where they've looked for possible health effects
[2:44:29.120 --> 2:44:35.120]  but three years ago at the harvard medical school four researchers published a paper in a journal
[2:44:35.840 --> 2:44:43.040]  on cancer in which they compared um they found higher levels of bone cancer osteosarcoma a rare
[2:44:43.040 --> 2:44:50.000]  type of of cancer in uh boys seven to eight years of age in a fluoridated community compared to a
[2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:57.360]  non fluoride uh drinking community so they found that there was elevated rates of osteosarcoma
[2:44:57.360 --> 2:45:02.080]  and um you know the study has some limitations because they looked at a small group of people
[2:45:02.080 --> 2:45:07.040]  but there's a whole bunch of studies around the world it uh we know that the fluoride is extremely
[2:45:07.040 --> 2:45:12.080]  toxic and there's definitely a concerns that it is a a human cancer causing well have you heard
[2:45:12.080 --> 2:45:17.440]  the new thing they're now saying mercury is good for you because it's coming out that it's in half
[2:45:17.440 --> 2:45:22.800]  the corn syrup that's washington post that it's coming out that it's in many products so the new
[2:45:22.800 --> 2:45:29.680]  spin is that mercury is actually good for you i'm not kidding guys go to youtube and google news
[2:45:29.680 --> 2:45:33.680]  says mercury good for you i'm gonna play that off local news austin because i don't want the
[2:45:33.680 --> 2:45:37.920]  doc to think i'm making this up you're gonna see fred can too tell you that mercury is good for
[2:45:37.920 --> 2:45:43.600]  you here in just a moment but please continue well anyway so uh there's actually many studies three
[2:45:43.600 --> 2:45:52.240]  years ago the uh national research council i had a panel of 13 scientists who are experts in toxicology
[2:45:52.240 --> 2:46:00.160]  epidemiology uh fluoride and chemistry and they did a three-year review of over 1100 studies worldwide
[2:46:00.160 --> 2:46:05.680]  about the dangers of fluoride in drinking water they didn't look specifically at fluoridation the
[2:46:05.680 --> 2:46:11.600]  adding of fluoride to the drinking water they looked at the whole issue of fluoride toxicology
[2:46:11.600 --> 2:46:19.360]  and they basically determined that uh the uh epa's maximum contaminant level of four parts per
[2:46:19.360 --> 2:46:25.520]  million is not protective of human health and that there should be it should be set much lower but
[2:46:25.520 --> 2:46:31.840]  epa hasn't done anything and so the city of austin's position is that as long as their fluoride level
[2:46:31.840 --> 2:46:37.360]  that they add to the water is less than this four parts per million level they think it's safe but
[2:46:37.360 --> 2:46:42.960]  there's but the british the russian the chinese studies i've seen show that it's cumulative so
[2:46:42.960 --> 2:46:47.680]  that's a fraud right and also they don't take into account that there's other fluorides there's
[2:46:47.680 --> 2:46:53.600]  fluoride in in the food beverages that are made with fluoridated water uh there's quite a bit of
[2:46:53.600 --> 2:46:58.320]  in tea people brush their teeth with fluoride containing toothpaste mouth washes there's
[2:46:58.320 --> 2:47:05.120]  some pharmaceuticals that some people take that have fluoride in it there's a there's a fluoridated
[2:47:05.120 --> 2:47:10.000]  pesticide so there's there could be some on the fruit yeah it's killing and now they want to spray it
[2:47:10.000 --> 2:47:14.240]  and i think i saw that a few years ago that a lot of the new pesticides are fluoride based
[2:47:14.240 --> 2:47:19.120]  it kills the bugs then we sit there and eat it like fools yeah because actually what we know
[2:47:19.120 --> 2:47:24.720]  so there's a lot of fluoride exposure from different sources and so the city of austin
[2:47:24.720 --> 2:47:30.800]  doesn't take into account this uh wide exposure that well we know the lobbyists come in and pay
[2:47:30.800 --> 2:47:35.360]  them off i mean that's what's going on i mean i mean they'll arrest you if you get caught dumping
[2:47:35.360 --> 2:47:39.360]  motor oil on the street and you should be but i might rather have motor oil going around than
[2:47:39.360 --> 2:47:44.880]  fluoride that's killing everything i mean fish can't live in tap water why are we drinking it i mean
[2:47:44.880 --> 2:47:52.080]  doc again i'm no doctor but but why does a goldfish die in a manner of hours if everybody should
[2:47:52.080 --> 2:47:56.400]  try this and i don't think it's nice to be cruel to fish but if it saves human lives do it you know
[2:47:56.400 --> 2:48:03.600]  the uh in the sixth grade you cut up frogs i think the schools if it's so good ought to fill up a uh
[2:48:04.560 --> 2:48:10.000]  fish tank with with florida water right out of the tap there in the science lab put a fish in it
[2:48:10.000 --> 2:48:15.440]  and watch it be deader in a hammer the next day right next to clean water say out of a river with
[2:48:15.440 --> 2:48:21.120]  a fish in it i think that something simple like that will finally get the message across and the
[2:48:21.120 --> 2:48:25.680]  animal rights activists will say don't kill goldfish and whereas i don't enjoy killing goldfish
[2:48:25.680 --> 2:48:30.400]  i've got one at my house that's seven years old named fluffy we're very attached to if it'll save
[2:48:30.400 --> 2:48:35.440]  human lives how are we gonna then not hurt goldfish because it's cruel but make everybody drink this
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:42.640]  well what the national research council report came out with in 2006 is that the level of fluoride
[2:48:42.640 --> 2:48:49.360]  being added to the water is 250 times higher than what is in breast milk and breast milk we know
[2:48:49.360 --> 2:48:55.600]  mother's milk uh is it's got a trace trace level of natural fluoride because you need to trace amount
[2:48:55.600 --> 2:48:59.920]  need a small amount don't humans even need to trace amount of cyanide but but you don't want a lot
[2:48:59.920 --> 2:49:04.800]  of it right but the whole thing is that there's a very very low level and so what they're adding
[2:49:04.800 --> 2:49:11.680]  to the water is much higher to the 250 times higher than what is considered really safe
[2:49:11.680 --> 2:49:18.160]  and actually some of the researchers said that that with babies there is really no safe level
[2:49:18.160 --> 2:49:23.040]  of what's in the water that was my next point doc when i go to babies or us it's all give your kids
[2:49:23.040 --> 2:49:28.320]  fluoride pills by the fluoridated water for your baby and all the studies i've seen say it's three
[2:49:28.320 --> 2:49:33.760]  to four times worse for kids brains and bones and it is for adults so they is that what you're
[2:49:33.760 --> 2:49:39.440]  getting at is it's really bad for kids yes yes uh what we know and and this was first recognized
[2:49:39.440 --> 2:49:46.960]  in the 1950s by researchers who were studying enzymes and all of ourselves and our body uh run
[2:49:46.960 --> 2:49:51.440]  on partially on enzymes they're part of the assembly lines that keep everything going
[2:49:51.440 --> 2:49:58.320]  and fluoride poisons at least 62 enzyme systems in the human body unbelievable uh and so it's
[2:49:58.320 --> 2:50:03.920]  an endocrine disruptor yes and so some of the early opposition in the 1950s to fluoridation
[2:50:03.920 --> 2:50:10.480]  were the biochemists uh researching enzymes because they knew that fluoride was a powerful
[2:50:10.480 --> 2:50:16.240]  poison that interfered with uh enzymes in the body oh and as soon as that research came out oh put
[2:50:16.240 --> 2:50:21.680]  it in the water the Rockefeller just so happened to be a genesis but i'm sure doc there's nothing
[2:50:21.680 --> 2:50:26.480]  to do with that we should just trust them and drink it well it's it is interesting that one of the
[2:50:26.480 --> 2:50:34.480]  fluoride compounds used in the uh manufacturer of uranium is uranium hexafluoride it's a catalyst
[2:50:34.480 --> 2:50:39.360]  and so that was one of the ways that this kind of links back to the manhattan project uranium
[2:50:39.360 --> 2:50:44.960]  hexafluoride it's got six fluorine atoms in it it's been well known but it's also very toxic so
[2:50:44.960 --> 2:50:50.800]  in using this in the manhattan project along with using other fluoride catalysts in the aluminum
[2:50:50.800 --> 2:50:56.160]  industry uh to smelt aluminum and and to various kinds of aluminum products in the steel industry
[2:50:56.160 --> 2:51:01.200]  gotta break there to stay there doc this is riveting stuff very important drink the uranium
[2:51:01.200 --> 2:51:05.680]  economy have you down scared you might lose your job worry how you will provide for your
[2:51:05.680 --> 2:51:10.400]  family do you worry where your money will come from you know that the economy is getting worse

[2:54:12.640 --> 2:54:17.920]  mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal
[2:54:17.920 --> 2:54:23.200]  pediatrics there have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives and vaccines might
[2:54:23.200 --> 2:54:28.240]  impair the neurological development of children these new studies suggest that the opposite
[2:54:28.240 --> 2:54:32.960]  that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance
[2:54:32.960 --> 2:54:40.480]  everybody knows the dice are loaded ladies and gentlemen everybody knows the good guy's lost
[2:54:40.480 --> 2:54:48.480]  everybody knows that the dice are loaded everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
[2:54:49.200 --> 2:54:59.440]  everybody knows the war is over everybody knows the good guy's lost that aired two years ago we
[2:54:59.440 --> 2:55:06.800]  have Dr. Neil Carmen he's a biologist and also a chemist in here with us and he's fighting
[2:55:06.800 --> 2:55:12.640]  locally to expose how deadly poison fluoride is and then the other varieties you know i'm reading
[2:55:12.640 --> 2:55:17.040]  on here doc and it's saying what's in the stuff they put in the awesome water and you just got a
[2:55:17.040 --> 2:55:22.480]  tour after months of trying of the facility are staying some of our folks were in there as well
[2:55:22.480 --> 2:55:30.640]  h2 si f6 i guess is the formula hydrofluoricic acid and and but but in that itself i'm told
[2:55:30.640 --> 2:55:35.600]  it is a bunch of different things right it's only one of the compounds there's actually
[2:55:35.600 --> 2:55:40.960]  three forms of fluorine in there there's the hydrofluorosilic acid which is the primary
[2:55:40.960 --> 2:55:47.680]  fluoride the city is seeking there's also some elemental fluorine and there's hydrofluoric
[2:55:47.680 --> 2:55:54.960]  acid and then there's heavy metals lead cadmium chromium brillium barium and then there could
[2:55:54.960 --> 2:56:01.680]  be other trace impurities and one of the concerns i have based upon what the epa says about the
[2:56:01.680 --> 2:56:08.800]  phosphate rock in florida is it's known to contain radionuclides including uranium and thorium that's
[2:56:08.800 --> 2:56:15.280]  on that's where they mine it is out of the phosphate rock yeah there's a huge deposits
[2:56:15.280 --> 2:56:20.880]  of phosphate rock in florida and it has a lot of impurities in it uh flooring is just one of
[2:56:20.880 --> 2:56:24.720]  the impurities but there's also and they don't even purify this that's what the other doctors
[2:56:24.720 --> 2:56:31.360]  have said and the and the epa people have had on admit that they call it fluoride oh we fluoridate
[2:56:31.360 --> 2:56:36.960]  but really they just take the toxic waste of all these industries and just put it in our water
[2:56:36.960 --> 2:56:42.720]  well the city the city claimed to us that there is some kind of distillation or filtration but
[2:56:42.720 --> 2:56:47.520]  they don't you know they haven't supplied any documents as to what that is i know that the
[2:56:47.520 --> 2:56:53.360]  company they buy it from uh it basically is just kind of like a warehouse to you know store the
[2:56:53.360 --> 2:56:59.600]  chemicals and sell them lucy or chemicals but mosaic uh i i don't know what they do but it's
[2:56:59.600 --> 2:57:06.800]  possible that it's just basically directly sold uh it's brought here in a large tanker truck um
[2:57:06.800 --> 2:57:12.240]  and uh and they declared national security we wanted to get cameras in and they wouldn't let us
[2:57:12.240 --> 2:57:16.880]  have cameras saying national security and i guess it is national security to give us this
[2:57:16.880 --> 2:57:23.120]  toxic chemical well they're their issue uh with that alex is that you've got this drinking water
[2:57:23.120 --> 2:57:28.720]  supply for the whole city of us somebody might put poison in it like them right right so uh
[2:57:28.720 --> 2:57:34.720]  you know but what's interesting is that the uh fluoridation uh storage at the water treatment
[2:57:34.720 --> 2:57:41.280]  plant is in a kind of it's in a totally contained building uh with um warnings on it because of the
[2:57:41.280 --> 2:57:47.280]  corrosive nature of the uh hydrofluorosalistic acid that they store there in two fiberglass tanks
[2:57:47.280 --> 2:57:52.880]  skull and crossbones so it's a it's a it's a self-contained building that cost a great deal to
[2:57:52.880 --> 2:57:58.560]  construct and to operate this uh because of the hazardous nature of this chemical that they're
[2:57:58.560 --> 2:58:03.520]  adding to the water amazing now coming in you got to see that clip because i know it sounds crazy
[2:58:03.520 --> 2:58:09.440]  when i say that the news is saying mercury's good for your brain that was a national report a local
[2:58:09.440 --> 2:58:14.640]  version of it it was put out by cbs news as a press release i also have a clip in time i'm not
[2:58:14.640 --> 2:58:20.720]  going to play it saying lead is good for children on msnbc the doctor does that sound normal to you
[2:58:20.720 --> 2:58:25.680]  uh no because basically uh there's different pediatricians who have done research uh in the
[2:58:25.680 --> 2:58:30.800]  us on lead and they and people like dr phil landrigan who was here in austin two months ago say the
[2:58:30.800 --> 2:58:36.240]  there is no safe level of lead exposure to what about mercury though and mercury is also highly
[2:58:36.240 --> 2:58:40.240]  toxic so i mean that's that's vitamin m we'll be right back in 60 seconds

[3:00:11.920 --> 3:00:17.120]  all right in the next segment we've got ray nadler olnick coming in she heads up fluoride
[3:00:17.120 --> 3:00:22.160]  free austin dot com fighting the city council that gets the lobbying money for these chemical
[3:00:22.160 --> 3:00:28.800]  companies to take the uh byproducts of the petrochemical industry uh and the fertilizer
[3:00:28.800 --> 3:00:33.760]  industry the aluminum purification industry and dumps it right in our water supply and we're
[3:00:33.760 --> 3:00:43.680]  talking to a phd doctor of chemistry and biology dr. neal carman doc is there a particular way
[3:00:43.680 --> 3:00:47.360]  for people to read your research or a website people can find out more about you or is the best
[3:00:47.360 --> 3:00:53.200]  place is fluoride free austin dot com well uh dr paul conat in new york has a great website
[3:00:53.200 --> 3:01:03.360]  fluoride alert dot org and uh he has a list of over 2535 professionals phd's medical doctors
[3:01:03.360 --> 3:01:10.480]  dentists nurses and and other neurologists who have signed on to this professional statement
[3:01:10.480 --> 3:01:16.000]  uh calling for an end to fluoridation in the united states because in europe there is virtually no
[3:01:16.000 --> 3:01:22.720]  fluoridation uh they determined over there based on medical toxicology and health studies that this
[3:01:22.720 --> 3:01:27.280]  is not good to be doing to the public and it weakens teeth i mean my dad's a dentist and didn't
[3:01:27.280 --> 3:01:32.160]  believe me and over the years i gave him documents and he now agrees i'm right yes yes so that so
[3:01:32.160 --> 3:01:37.280]  actually the u.s. is the primary country in the world where fluoridation is commonly practiced
[3:01:37.280 --> 3:01:42.480]  well look i was never a hypochondriac i got sick like twice a year i could have a broken collar
[3:01:42.480 --> 3:01:46.560]  bone i want to go to the doctor so i wasn't imagining it i would brush my teeth real good
[3:01:46.560 --> 3:01:50.800]  as my daddy was a dentist and i always remember laying down on the couch and having a headache
[3:01:50.800 --> 3:01:55.440]  to where i almost got ready to like to brush my teeth until i was finally about 16 17 and i figured
[3:01:55.440 --> 3:02:00.400]  i could go to the store and buy tom's of main without it i figured out with it for ever heard
[3:02:00.400 --> 3:02:07.440]  of this that fluoride was giving me headaches well and actually every toothpaste container that has
[3:02:07.440 --> 3:02:13.280]  fluoride in it in the u.s. is required to have a toxic warning label that if a child ingests too
[3:02:13.280 --> 3:02:20.160]  much of this uh they are supposed to call the poison control center now uh 20 25 years ago there
[3:02:20.160 --> 3:02:25.120]  was actually a skull and crossbones warning label on every toothpaste and box of toothpaste
[3:02:25.120 --> 3:02:31.200]  because of the fluoride that they've added so the the toothpaste is a big issue because already
[3:02:31.200 --> 3:02:36.480]  children are getting dosed every every time they you know brush their teeth they're getting some
[3:02:36.480 --> 3:02:41.920]  fluoride uh they're ingesting a lot they say if you get a pea-sized amount most kids swallow
[3:02:41.920 --> 3:02:46.480]  that much call poison control immediately the kids don't they eat the toothpaste go collapse on the
[3:02:46.480 --> 3:02:51.600]  couch and and i've seen the studies about iq reduction i mean it's a fact didn't they make
[3:02:51.600 --> 3:02:56.080]  jokes about it kind of like now i say mercury's bad for you and they go no i saw the news it's good
[3:02:56.080 --> 3:03:00.560]  you're a conspiracy theorist you're a chemist you're somebody who studied biology you're a
[3:03:00.560 --> 3:03:07.600]  scientist is mercury good for the brain i don't think so i have i haven't seen evidence uh that i
[3:03:07.600 --> 3:03:12.720]  you know subscribe to that mercury uh has any health benefits to the body well under an electron
[3:03:12.720 --> 3:03:17.680]  microscope the university of calgary we've shown in fact i want to show people that google electron
[3:03:17.680 --> 3:03:23.760]  microscope video mercury brain tissue and this is monkey brain tissue and it's the only heavy
[3:03:23.760 --> 3:03:30.000]  metal they found that causes an electrochemical almost explosion chain reaction normal plaques
[3:03:30.800 --> 3:03:35.280]  it just builds up as a plaque it only kills what it touches but this causes an electrochemical
[3:03:35.280 --> 3:03:40.480]  short circuit right i've i've seen that it's very it looks very well done because it shows the the
[3:03:40.480 --> 3:03:45.680]  neuron shrinking away from the mercury but maybe you haven't had enough mercury doc maybe that's why
[3:03:45.680 --> 3:03:49.840]  you think it's bad maybe if you'd eat more you could join the rest of the normal people
[3:03:49.840 --> 3:03:54.800]  that can hardly talk now have you seen how a lot of adults can hardly talk now maybe maybe maybe you
[3:03:54.800 --> 3:04:00.160]  need more mercury and fluoride doc well we've known actually if you study a biochemistry like i took
[3:04:00.160 --> 3:04:06.400]  you know a long time ago one of the classic ways to basically kill protein function is with heavy
[3:04:06.400 --> 3:04:13.120]  metals like lead and mercury so we've known for a long time that these toxic metals are very bad
[3:04:13.120 --> 3:04:18.000]  for biological systems dr carmen everybody knows mercury's good that's why they give it to kids
[3:04:18.000 --> 3:04:23.280]  that's why they have mercury bottles at the whole foods if you go there in the vitamin section
[3:04:23.280 --> 3:04:31.280]  it's vitamin m well i i disagree i think mercury is extremely harmful uh we've seen studies where
[3:04:31.280 --> 3:04:36.480]  a single gram of mercury which is about the size of the grain of rice will contaminate a 20 acre
[3:04:36.480 --> 3:04:42.240]  lake so that the fish are too toxic with methyl mercury concentrations to eat but but but wait
[3:04:42.240 --> 3:04:47.840]  the government says it's good why don't you just trust them and and be a patriot i mean
[3:04:47.840 --> 3:04:53.200]  you know you know i think i should just drink mercury on air improve everybody this is nutritious
[3:04:53.200 --> 3:04:58.240]  and good uh you know what this is extreme we're gonna come back more and talk about these people
[3:04:58.240 --> 3:05:03.040]  that don't think we should be drinking sodium fluoride hello friends this is alex jones i've
[3:05:03.040 --> 3:05:07.200]  told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important

[3:08:45.680 --> 3:08:51.040]  because i would like to have you know we have great aquifer water here and i'd like to not have to
[3:08:51.040 --> 3:08:56.800]  be drinking uh you know water that i have shipped in from arkansas or water that i drink out of my
[3:08:56.800 --> 3:09:03.280]  big burkey because even with that uh even with the big burkey it only cuts out 95 or so that's why
[3:09:03.280 --> 3:09:07.680]  we now use the acola blue and speak of the devil i had them set up for a five minute interview
[3:09:07.680 --> 3:09:13.280]  a few weeks ago not knowing it coincided right for when they were on so it's not being done
[3:09:13.280 --> 3:09:17.440]  on purpose where i'm here exposing fluoride and then talking about the one way to make sure you're
[3:09:17.440 --> 3:09:21.360]  not drinking it atmospheric water generators so that's coming up in a moment but sir you were
[3:09:21.360 --> 3:09:26.560]  talking about google earth during the break and zooming in on these on these uh mines where the
[3:09:26.560 --> 3:09:32.480]  byproduct are all these different things not just the fluoride type chemicals that are being put
[3:09:32.480 --> 3:09:38.720]  in our water supply and other points that uh that that need to be made yes uh there's a county in
[3:09:38.720 --> 3:09:44.160]  florida where a group of these plants that mosaic and several other companies operate it's polk
[3:09:44.160 --> 3:09:52.400]  county near the cities small cities called um let's see one is barto and also mulberry and right
[3:09:52.400 --> 3:09:57.520]  around those cities you see these large strip mining operations for the phosphate rock and that's
[3:09:57.520 --> 3:10:02.640]  where the phosphate fertilizer manufacturing plants are located and then you can also see
[3:10:02.640 --> 3:10:09.920]  large uh waste piles of the phospho gypsum that's too contaminated with the radionuclide
[3:10:09.920 --> 3:10:15.360]  uranium and thorium to they don't know what to do with it uh the state of florida epa these companies
[3:10:15.360 --> 3:10:21.440]  it's too toxic to sell anywhere uh but you can go on google earth and see these large strip mining
[3:10:21.440 --> 3:10:27.440]  operations and huge waste piles i mean it looks like small mountains literally of the phospho gypsum
[3:10:27.440 --> 3:10:34.400]  waste um and and that's where the um these waste product this industrial has this waste containing
[3:10:34.400 --> 3:10:41.120]  fluoride uh is coming from from these uh manufacturing plants so we shouldn't say they're
[3:10:41.120 --> 3:10:45.760]  putting fluoride in our water that's a cover term that's bad enough they're putting the toxic waste
[3:10:45.760 --> 3:10:51.440]  in our water right right i mean this is not naturally occurring fluoride this is an industrial
[3:10:52.240 --> 3:10:58.560]  toxic fluoride waste product from the phosphate fertilizer manufacturing sector there's a few
[3:10:58.560 --> 3:11:04.880]  other industries where they generate some fluorides as well from copper smelting and aluminum
[3:11:04.880 --> 3:11:11.280]  smelting and the steel industry so there there can be other sources of this fluoride as well
[3:11:11.280 --> 3:11:18.000]  amazing what do we do about this you guys i did a tour there we we heard about it and uh
[3:11:18.640 --> 3:11:23.920]  kind of came in under your wing we appreciate you guys contacting us and the work you're doing
[3:11:24.640 --> 3:11:28.720]  if we just get more austinites or more people listening in upstate new york or chicago or
[3:11:28.720 --> 3:11:33.600]  california right now we have listeners all over the country we have over 80 affiliates xm radio
[3:11:33.600 --> 3:11:39.360]  listening right now this i mean this is really toxic waste you guys are finding if more people
[3:11:39.360 --> 3:11:44.400]  would stand up the majority of the epa scientist i know signed letters we've had their head on
[3:11:44.400 --> 3:11:48.400]  saying this is toxic waste the government doesn't like this the people that actually work in the
[3:11:48.400 --> 3:11:55.200]  government don't know it's bad how do we end this and then tell us about the tour and we'll get
[3:11:55.200 --> 3:12:02.640]  it some some comments from ray nadler olning ray ray has been speaking to the city council so she
[3:12:02.640 --> 3:12:12.960]  should talk about that yeah tell us about solutions yes actually my uh my idea came from you oh really
[3:12:12.960 --> 3:12:18.160]  we're spurring people to take it i didn't know that it partly came from joey sorale and it partly
[3:12:18.160 --> 3:12:24.720]  came earlier from circumstances which we can go back to if you want but uh basically the idea
[3:12:24.720 --> 3:12:30.480]  for i'd had entered my mind i had heard you talking about it more and more on the radio and i listened
[3:12:30.480 --> 3:12:40.160]  to you every day i wanted to know that oh yeah oh faithfully and uh one day last fall a man called
[3:12:40.160 --> 3:12:46.960]  in from another state i think it was pennsylvania he was not a texan and he he said i've been trying
[3:12:46.960 --> 3:12:52.640]  to wake the people up around me to pour right and they just aren't listening to me they dismiss it
[3:12:52.640 --> 3:12:59.920]  they shrug it off what should i do and you said among other things you said get active go to city
[3:12:59.920 --> 3:13:07.360]  hall become known as the guy who talks about fluoride every week and and you you uh had other
[3:13:07.360 --> 3:13:13.200]  suggestions to like start a radio program advertise filters water filters and as a way to
[3:13:13.200 --> 3:13:18.000]  fund yourself but exactly that way you're helping people and funding yourself it's symbiotic but
[3:13:18.000 --> 3:13:25.120]  it is but what really struck me was bingo i can do that i have the time flexibility to do that
[3:13:25.120 --> 3:13:32.400]  but and uh i studied i i was a total political virgin i will have to say i have never lifted
[3:13:32.400 --> 3:13:37.920]  a finger in activism before although i have given money to all my favorite broadcasters including
[3:13:37.920 --> 3:13:46.000]  you um but there you go the 600 into the valley oh my gosh yes yes um i studied it a little and
[3:13:46.000 --> 3:13:51.680]  i came to realize that they had this citizen communication at noon when most people can't
[3:13:51.680 --> 3:13:57.280]  come this is for communications used to be at night used to be but now they've made it so hard
[3:13:57.280 --> 3:14:02.240]  got to sign up a week before two weeks two weeks oh now it actually will be one year it's two weeks
[3:14:02.240 --> 3:14:07.520]  20 years right exactly i don't want to hear from you i had been under the impression it was evenings
[3:14:07.520 --> 3:14:12.720]  two no they well i guess they keep changing it well it's this is for this is for items that
[3:14:12.720 --> 3:14:17.360]  are not on the uh what do you call it on the agenda so what you do is scan the agenda anything on
[3:14:17.360 --> 3:14:24.400]  water related you can come in you're right and i had anything uh that's related to uh uh the
[3:14:24.400 --> 3:14:32.480]  environment see this sorry go ahead oh no we um we have just started talking before the environmental
[3:14:32.480 --> 3:14:39.680]  board in a similar way uh that suggestion came to me from neil and also from paul robbins who's a very
[3:14:39.680 --> 3:14:47.280]  uh uh very well known activist in uh austin in fact the editor of the austin environmental good
[3:14:47.280 --> 3:14:54.960]  directory and he had that idea so now i'm going to be doing it not only on uh on uh council meetings
[3:14:54.960 --> 3:15:00.880]  but also what we need is more people like you we're going to try to get that and in fact on this
[3:15:00.880 --> 3:15:05.200]  program people who are interested will hear about it and don't let them stop you i mean pretty soon
[3:15:05.200 --> 3:15:09.120]  they're just going to get rid of it all together but then you just go speak on items you just go
[3:15:09.120 --> 3:15:14.400]  check each week what the agenda is but but go sign up take your lunch off you know take a bag lunch
[3:15:14.400 --> 3:15:19.760]  and eat it while you're driving down there and go let the and let these creatures know that you don't
[3:15:19.760 --> 3:15:26.240]  want this poison in the water i mean it's not our opinion a fish can't live in it i know that well
[3:15:26.240 --> 3:15:30.480]  i mean no i know you know but the listeners new listeners don't know yeah what we were told yesterday
[3:15:30.480 --> 3:15:36.560]  on the tour has re saw is that all the city has to do is turn the the little tap off where the
[3:15:36.560 --> 3:15:42.560]  hydrofluoric acid is coming out our hydrofluorosalic acid and so uh re might want to point that out
[3:15:42.560 --> 3:15:46.320]  too i mean that was quite amazing that the city said all they have to do is just turn it off and
[3:15:46.320 --> 3:15:51.120]  stop it well there's laws against forced medication and they say they're doing it for our teeth and
[3:15:51.120 --> 3:15:56.000]  all the studies say it makes them fracture and gives you dental fluorosis so the and now the the
[3:15:56.000 --> 3:16:00.080]  american dental association as you know two years ago began recommending children not brush their
[3:16:00.080 --> 3:16:06.000]  teeth with it i mean even the dental association says it's bad but we can't get these bastards to
[3:16:06.000 --> 3:16:10.080]  take it out of our water well they're sorry they also said the centers for disease control in the
[3:16:10.080 --> 3:16:15.920]  american dental association that fluoridated water should not be used to make up infant formula some
[3:16:15.920 --> 3:16:20.480]  mothers but mothers haven't been warned that they didn't really make that widely public well it's
[3:16:20.480 --> 3:16:24.800]  it's your activities everybody else take an action we're having victories here but but
[3:16:24.800 --> 3:16:28.560]  i'm gonna shut up because we got a guest popping in with you on the same subject in the next segment
[3:16:28.560 --> 3:16:33.680]  and we're keeping till 40 after then gary tallis been vindicated 9-11 truth or i've been slandered
[3:16:33.680 --> 3:16:39.120]  by fox news is coming on but that's a separate issue at the end of the show tell us about what
[3:16:39.120 --> 3:16:43.520]  happened at this term my guys were there but they had to turn their cameras off for national security
[3:16:43.520 --> 3:16:49.120]  tell us how you got in what happened how important this was well a month ago i decided that it was
[3:16:49.120 --> 3:16:56.480]  be a good idea to request a tour from the city so they they agreed and then i said that other
[3:16:56.480 --> 3:17:01.440]  people would like to join the tour i thought it would be a great educational opportunity for people
[3:17:01.440 --> 3:17:06.800]  to see how the water purification plant works for the city and where they're at in the fluoride
[3:17:06.800 --> 3:17:12.880]  and to hear this straight from them uh and so we uh toured the you know most of the the plant
[3:17:12.880 --> 3:17:19.120]  and when we came to this containment building uh where they have two uh hydrofluorosilic acid
[3:17:19.120 --> 3:17:25.280]  storage tanks uh several thousand gallons in size that building i mean it's a containment building
[3:17:25.280 --> 3:17:31.040]  so if there's a leak everything is contained in there but it's obvious the doors are labeled
[3:17:31.040 --> 3:17:38.240]  that that this is a highly toxic corrosive acidic material and they've got a shower in there in case
[3:17:38.240 --> 3:17:45.280]  you get exposed and you could see some signs of corrosion to some of the paint and materials where
[3:17:45.280 --> 3:17:50.480]  there's probably been some vapor leak because this is such a corrosive material in fact where the
[3:17:50.480 --> 3:17:58.160]  tanker truck comes in and unloads the liquid hydrofluorosilic acid into the pipes to fill the
[3:17:58.160 --> 3:18:04.160]  tanks you could see where there had been leaks and the concrete was corroded on the ground it was
[3:18:04.160 --> 3:18:10.080]  kind of eaten away where a few drops of this stuff have gotten down so and on all the lines that the
[3:18:10.080 --> 3:18:16.480]  city has there uh the the lines containing this chemical are all specially colored and labeled
[3:18:16.480 --> 3:18:22.160]  that this has fluoride in it well i just want to point out that we drilled the well on our family
[3:18:22.160 --> 3:18:29.600]  property in east texas into the uh keychai level that's 600 feet down it's a little aquifer and i
[3:18:29.600 --> 3:18:35.920]  have family that runs the local water district they worked there uh and you know they're at the plant
[3:18:36.480 --> 3:18:42.960]  it's actually it's my it's my uncle's uh wife's brother but the point is he said it's the purest
[3:18:42.960 --> 3:18:48.320]  best water aquifer water and they make them add all these chemicals under federal law he thought it
[3:18:48.320 --> 3:18:54.400]  was some mandate but the issue is austin has great aquifer water there's no reason to be doing any of
[3:18:54.400 --> 3:18:58.960]  this adding chlorine any of it i mean that's a whole nother subject i mean if you've got aquifer
[3:18:58.960 --> 3:19:02.960]  water and you're not drinking out of some toxic reservoir that's got sewage in it like dallas
[3:19:02.960 --> 3:19:09.680]  or something why on earth would you put anything in in the best water there is well they're they
[3:19:09.680 --> 3:19:15.680]  definitely talked about the different uh treatment chemicals that they're adding and but our tour was
[3:19:15.680 --> 3:19:20.560]  more focused on the fluoride but they went through the water uh treatment and purification process
[3:19:20.560 --> 3:19:25.920]  the filtration process so uh it was very interesting i think we learned a great deal but we could see
[3:19:25.920 --> 3:19:30.880]  you know from our own eyes that they're they're doing this fluoridation actively there they're
[3:19:30.880 --> 3:19:36.240]  putting uh so many gallons in you know a day and and they have to keep buying this chemical product
[3:19:36.240 --> 3:19:42.240]  but if people you know wanted this stopped by you know calling emailing uh the mayor and the city
[3:19:42.240 --> 3:19:47.680]  council going down to speak uh the city could easily turn it off and probably save a million
[3:19:47.680 --> 3:19:52.320]  dollars that's right that's the other point i've seen the studies this is toxic waste these mining
[3:19:52.320 --> 3:19:57.280]  companies would have to pay to get rid of instead they make us buy it what schmucks stay there let's
[3:19:57.280 --> 3:20:03.840]  talk more about taking action against us when we get back with food prices soaring to all time highs

[3:24:23.360 --> 3:24:29.280]  this guest on today when they were on but it dovetails together perfectly tyler palmer
[3:24:29.280 --> 3:24:35.920]  for this quick segment he's the developer one of the owners of a cola blue dot com atmospheric
[3:24:35.920 --> 3:24:40.320]  water generators now i'm telling my guest hey i've got a in the middle of our interview have
[3:24:40.320 --> 3:24:44.880]  somebody on to talk about uh water filtration and the doc was saying well you know even filters
[3:24:44.880 --> 3:24:49.840]  only cut some of it out and i said no this is atmospheric water generator it's grabbing it
[3:24:49.840 --> 3:24:55.920]  out of the air then putting it through reverse osmosis carbon filters you name it uh but uh it
[3:24:55.920 --> 3:25:01.040]  is good to have tyler palmer on with us tyler a perfect perfect day to have you on we're talking
[3:25:01.040 --> 3:25:06.960]  about uh forced fluoridation of the water supply with uh folks here in austin yeah i like it's a
[3:25:06.960 --> 3:25:13.440]  fascinating show and i'm i'm glad to be here um it it's correct that people would need uh very
[3:25:13.440 --> 3:25:22.880]  expensive ultra filtration if not reverse osmosis the prices in 10 000 to 20 000 dollars
[3:25:22.880 --> 3:25:29.680]  to be able to get fluoride out of the drinking water fortunately we have our atmospheric water
[3:25:29.680 --> 3:25:38.480]  generator which condenses the humidity in the air and filters the water and uh delivers about
[3:25:38.480 --> 3:25:43.280]  a pure water yeah well yeah i mean absolutely i have children so i looked into this and a big
[3:25:43.280 --> 3:25:50.720]  murky reduces it cuts a lot of it out of reverse osmosis 90 something percent because fluoride's
[3:25:50.720 --> 3:25:56.000]  so little it it stays in the water it it's just perfect for this but if it's out of the air
[3:25:56.560 --> 3:26:00.800]  there is almost no fluoride in the air there's some trace amounts because it's sprayed on
[3:26:00.800 --> 3:26:06.320]  lawns and blowing around explain that to people until folks about the coloblue system yeah that's
[3:26:06.320 --> 3:26:17.840]  right the molecular weight of chlorophyllic acid is about 144.08 atomic mass unit so it's
[3:26:17.840 --> 3:26:26.720]  actually very small most ultra filtration systems cut off at about 1000 am use yeah the dock is
[3:26:26.720 --> 3:26:32.080]  nodding his head dock you're you're you're saying uh that uh paler palmer's right yes on the molecular
[3:26:32.080 --> 3:26:36.880]  weight yes so it's very hard for regular filters to cut this out it's a very small molecule yes
[3:26:37.920 --> 3:26:45.920]  and it's so sneaky it gets in in places it sticks to things it's it's uh got a very low pH uh
[3:26:46.560 --> 3:26:54.960]  about uh 1.2 if not uh lower that's i think lower than stomach acid so it's just not a very pleasant
[3:26:54.960 --> 3:27:01.360]  thing to have in your water and and or to have to deal with so yeah the bottom line way to cut this
[3:27:01.360 --> 3:27:06.720]  out is the a coloblue system and i can't think of a better time to be promoting this for listeners
[3:27:06.720 --> 3:27:18.400]  the website is a coloblue.com we'll put it up on screen www.ecoblu.com or 1-800-691-6043
[3:27:18.400 --> 3:27:24.960]  1-800-691-6043. Tyler the reason we've got you up today is because you've got a new special
[3:27:24.960 --> 3:27:30.800]  your offering folks tell them about what you're offering that's right uh we have that sort of the
[3:27:30.800 --> 3:27:40.000]  we call it the emergency hurricane in a new world order prepared special and uh for $1,351
[3:27:41.040 --> 3:27:47.280]  you get a a new echoloblue model 28 and those are the uh the new machines with the they have a very
[3:27:47.840 --> 3:27:54.320]  neat redesigned lcd screen with a stainless steel tank uh lower storage tank with an additional
[3:27:54.320 --> 3:28:03.920]  uv light in that storage tank and you get a 6.5 hp 200 2,800 watt max watts rated electric governor
[3:28:04.720 --> 3:28:11.440]  for only one dollar that's a 375 dollar value what does that do with the machine well that that
[3:28:11.440 --> 3:28:18.720]  will power the machine in the event that your power goes off um in in an emergency you can
[3:28:18.720 --> 3:28:26.240]  power the machine and it has a surplus energy so that you can charge flashlights and and you know
[3:28:26.240 --> 3:28:35.120]  run your refrigerator or or something to that effect charge up your car or you know whatever
[3:28:35.120 --> 3:28:41.360]  you need so this is have your water off the grid and so so how much off is this in this special
[3:28:41.360 --> 3:28:46.720]  looks like the biggest special you've ever offered off the regular price well the the price is the
[3:28:46.720 --> 3:28:54.160]  same of it's the regular price but uh since we're we're selling a generator for one dollar a
[3:28:54.160 --> 3:29:04.160]  375 dollar generator um that that's the equivalent of uh basically below uh a thousand dollars for
[3:29:04.160 --> 3:29:11.280]  the 28 so we're talking 25 percent off uh or so uh roughly that's just an amazing deal a coloblue
[3:29:11.280 --> 3:29:19.040]  dot com we give folks the toll free number 800 6 9 1 60 43 1 800 6 9 1 60 43 folks if you love

[3:32:04.160 --> 3:32:08.640]  one of our affiliate radio stations he got laid off from a job he loved many years ago he was
[3:32:08.640 --> 3:32:13.760]  devastated but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone
[3:32:13.760 --> 3:32:18.480]  and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day there is no job security you are
[3:32:18.480 --> 3:32:23.600]  always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own
[3:32:23.600 --> 3:32:30.480]  business since you are the boss nobody can fire you so mz has been his own boss for over 37 years
[3:32:30.480 --> 3:32:35.920]  and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves
[3:32:35.920 --> 3:32:41.280]  and not for others mz wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the

[3:33:12.960 --> 3:33:18.320]  coming up i'm going to engage in a big news blitz an acquittal in laura bush case heckling
[3:33:18.320 --> 3:33:24.320]  case you're not a press international we'll talk about that coming up
[3:33:28.640 --> 3:33:33.840]  but right now going back to dr. neal karman anti fluoride activists here in austin texas
[3:33:33.840 --> 3:33:39.520]  anti-floridation activists and ray nadler olnik okay so so we're fighting in here in austin it's
[3:33:39.520 --> 3:33:44.720]  the same thing all over the country and you got all these environmentalists and again environmentalism
[3:33:44.720 --> 3:33:49.120]  has all this reasonable smart stuff like let's not poison the environment let's not have pollution
[3:33:49.120 --> 3:33:53.680]  let's not toxify ourselves but it seems like the austin city council only wants to grab people's
[3:33:53.680 --> 3:33:59.120]  property for environmental preserves and later build skyscrapers on it so so really they're just
[3:33:59.120 --> 3:34:04.560]  you know want to be realtors like herk watson is now the big realtor here in town this is a real
[3:34:04.560 --> 3:34:11.120]  environmental issue for the environment the birds the bees the plants human beings so this is something
[3:34:11.120 --> 3:34:16.400]  affecting everybody with the fluoridation and you were telling me doc you guys saw where the
[3:34:16.400 --> 3:34:23.200]  fluoride or what they call fluoride this witch's brew was going in uh yes uh they uh they had one
[3:34:23.200 --> 3:34:27.360]  of the units uh one of the storage tanks still had a small amount of fluoride in it they were
[3:34:27.360 --> 3:34:34.640]  expecting another shipment very soon uh from florida and uh and so the uh the pump was actively
[3:34:34.640 --> 3:34:39.920]  pumping a small amount of fluoride putting it into the water mixing it there uh they explained the
[3:34:39.920 --> 3:34:45.520]  whole process lovingly mixing it though right we got we got to see the whole thing and so i mean
[3:34:45.520 --> 3:34:53.280]  the city is spending a lot of money a year uh they just renewed the contract yes um the city had a
[3:34:53.280 --> 3:34:59.920]  contract of which i had the cover page but i didn't have the entire contract and i was getting
[3:34:59.920 --> 3:35:07.360]  information off of the cover page which gave some summaries they had a contract that was set to run
[3:35:07.360 --> 3:35:16.320]  from march 08 through march 2010 with three optional one-year extensions and the amount
[3:35:17.040 --> 3:35:26.480]  of money uh that it was to cost was approximately six hundred thousand dollars a year wow now
[3:35:28.880 --> 3:35:36.560]  this past march they suddenly renewed that contract they cancelled that contract and
[3:35:36.560 --> 3:35:41.680]  issued a new one which is apparently legal there was there must be something written
[3:35:41.680 --> 3:35:48.480]  into the contract that allows allows that to happen and in fact i have now i have now requested
[3:35:48.480 --> 3:35:54.000]  through uh uh freedom of information both contracts the old we don't know if it's more or less we
[3:35:54.000 --> 3:36:01.520]  don't know it's more it's way more um what they did they issued a new one for an amount of uh
[3:36:01.520 --> 3:36:15.600]  approximately 700 000 for this one this one runs from 09 to uh 2011 and the 700 000 a year over
[3:36:15.600 --> 3:36:24.080]  a year and then the three extensions that they're locked into presumably are 910 thousand dollars
[3:36:24.080 --> 3:36:29.520]  a year for the next three years that would be starting so we mean millions and millions of
[3:36:29.520 --> 3:36:35.280]  dollars and and and they admit this is the toxic waste of fertilizer production aluminum
[3:36:35.280 --> 3:36:40.960]  purification and nuclear weapons production and they would have to pay to put this in mineshafts
[3:36:40.960 --> 3:36:50.080]  in in in utah or nevada instead they have us pay to drink it yes you know it's not going to go down
[3:36:50.080 --> 3:36:56.480]  and in fact they're um i subpoenaed some documents and the wow you're really getting busy i i am
[3:36:56.480 --> 3:37:02.880]  getting busy uh this is this is all new to me and i'm learning as i go and the reason given for this
[3:37:02.880 --> 3:37:09.680]  by lucier was that their own supplier which is which is mosaic the actual manufacturer
[3:37:09.680 --> 3:37:17.840]  had suddenly doubled their price just overnight they doubled it so lucier was kindly going to pass
[3:37:17.840 --> 3:37:25.600]  on a little less of that cost they wanted an increase in 37 percent so everybody else is
[3:37:25.600 --> 3:37:30.480]  losing their jobs are taking pay cuts the economy's imploding and they're going hey we got some toxic
[3:37:30.480 --> 3:37:35.440]  waste hey the suckers in austin and every other city we're doubling and how about triple how about
[3:37:35.440 --> 3:37:40.960]  we all sell our houses and become homeless and we'll pay 10 billion dollars for the for the toxic
[3:37:40.960 --> 3:37:47.600]  waste i mean we could i mean see it's just like with the banks how we're paying them 14.8 trillion
[3:37:47.600 --> 3:37:53.360]  of our money to go loot the world and and then we pay interest on the money that taxpayers are going
[3:37:53.360 --> 3:38:01.200]  to pay i mean who comes up with these diabolical frauds well and we don't even know the total
[3:38:01.200 --> 3:38:06.160]  cost of the program that's just a chemical purchasing cost from the company in florida
[3:38:06.160 --> 3:38:10.880]  uh for the toxic industrial fertilizer waste but uh there's also there's got to be some the building
[3:38:10.880 --> 3:38:17.600]  the storage the shipping the insurance and so forth yes it's it's has to be very expensive i mean
[3:38:17.600 --> 3:38:21.040]  we figured it's got to be over a million years this is some estimates we've seen from other
[3:38:21.040 --> 3:38:25.840]  cities around the country where the cost of the chemicals may be 50 to 60 percent then
[3:38:25.840 --> 3:38:30.800]  these corrosive chemicals eat up your pumps and equipment so pipes so they gotta have insurance
[3:38:30.800 --> 3:38:35.680]  policies right right and and the workers have to be very careful so that was the reason why
[3:38:36.240 --> 3:38:42.240]  recently the city of elgan which is just northeast of austin on 290 voted not to continue
[3:38:42.240 --> 3:38:47.760]  floridation anymore and so did alamo heights on the north side of san antonio yeah that's the point
[3:38:47.760 --> 3:38:51.440]  i was going to make san antonio anti fluoride group has really been one of the biggest in the
[3:38:51.440 --> 3:38:57.680]  country and in closing we are having victories we can affect change if people get involved
[3:38:57.680 --> 3:39:03.120]  and point out what a ridiculous fraud this is yeah there's actually over a list of over
[3:39:03.120 --> 3:39:11.120]  212 us cities that have now uh shot down floridation artificial water floridation there is a lot of
[3:39:11.120 --> 3:39:18.320]  money on the other side and that is that is really the sum and substance of it and people are deep
[3:39:18.320 --> 3:39:26.720]  deep in denial for instance the cdc who can advise against giving fluoride to infants
[3:39:27.760 --> 3:39:34.560]  and at the same time insist vehemently that it's one of the 10 greatest public health measures of
[3:39:34.560 --> 3:39:38.640]  the 20th century that's what i was going to say how can they say don't give it to infants it hurts
[3:39:38.640 --> 3:39:43.360]  their brains and bone development that's admitted now official government but then when you go in
[3:39:43.360 --> 3:39:48.000]  the store it's give fluoride to your kids i mean it i mean it's not just that they don't care
[3:39:48.000 --> 3:39:52.400]  and are making money there's a very sick agenda here oh yeah because we know the neurological
[3:39:52.400 --> 3:39:56.800]  effects it has that's a fact and you know they can make all the doctor strange loves they want
[3:39:56.800 --> 3:40:01.840]  making fun of us i have the reports from major universities we've read them on air where they
[3:40:01.840 --> 3:40:07.760]  knew the university of texas in the 30s had studies on fluoride and its effects on the brain
[3:40:07.760 --> 3:40:13.120]  and so uh when you search them some of the first you find is german studies and us studies the
[3:40:13.120 --> 3:40:17.840]  university of texas i don't know if you've seen those doc but uh it's amazing right well it's
[3:40:17.840 --> 3:40:28.240]  because uh of um fluorine as a uh or fluoride compounds as a flux for smelting was very very
[3:40:28.240 --> 3:40:35.680]  important to the war effort uh steel and aluminum and uranium all require um large amounts of
[3:40:35.680 --> 3:40:41.520]  calcium fluoride or sodium fluoride in their process and it's cost prohibitive to store it
[3:40:41.520 --> 3:40:47.120]  in toxic dumps so make people drink it and it makes them sit down and shut up well they wind up
[3:40:47.120 --> 3:40:53.040]  producing a lot of fluoride waste products and and the workers were being uh harmed some of them
[3:40:53.040 --> 3:40:58.320]  were actually dying uh neighbors so there were lawsuits being filed in the 1940s tennessee
[3:40:58.320 --> 3:41:04.000]  the aluminum industry the steel industry and uh governmental agencies said well this is a problem
[3:41:04.000 --> 3:41:08.960]  we've got to crush these lawsuits look i want to have you both back in the next few months as this
[3:41:08.960 --> 3:41:16.000]  develops and please uh continue your fight thank you for your help videotape your city council
[3:41:16.720 --> 3:41:20.560]  confrontations because i'm going to make a film about the whole eugenics angles we have their
[3:41:20.560 --> 3:41:25.680]  documents uh you know why they're doing this you wonder why the public so passive the drugs the
[3:41:25.680 --> 3:41:31.840]  entertainment the gmo foods all of this is putting people in a very docile docile state and uh doctor

[3:46:05.680 --> 3:46:10.240]  the witnesses all told me the same thing he comes across running and screaming and then you try to
[3:46:10.240 --> 3:46:15.440]  get away and he starts ramming you ramming you screaming don't attack her that that's accurate
[3:46:16.000 --> 3:46:19.600]  something like that you hit me from the back in screaming at the beginning trying to do an
[3:46:19.600 --> 3:46:23.440]  receptive manner he was hiding those was a snake attack then he started screaming and okay i was
[3:46:23.440 --> 3:46:28.960]  going for memory tell us about the snake attack it was very well coordinated he was standing there
[3:46:28.960 --> 3:46:35.280]  by uh the side entrance hiding waiting to have me pass by so you could you know be a man and uh
[3:46:35.280 --> 3:46:41.120]  you know what he considers is a man and a hit me from the back uh using his uh handicap daughter
[3:46:41.120 --> 3:46:48.480]  that he who he who he uses as a trophy by the way together he needed to hand it in at least until
[3:46:48.480 --> 3:46:54.240]  he apologizes and admits that was a fabrication on his show but being a cia commander he probably
[3:46:54.240 --> 3:47:00.480]  won't um probably we may not go anywhere because the news they basically um you know they they get
[3:47:00.480 --> 3:47:05.440]  away with stuff like that they always uh um they get away with it because people don't stand up to
[3:47:05.440 --> 3:47:10.400]  them believe me you start suing people and all look they were trying to put you in prison saying we
[3:47:10.400 --> 3:47:15.040]  all attack they were on the news saying you were choking her and beating her and blood was shooting
[3:47:15.040 --> 3:47:21.040]  everywhere i mean just total lies i mean they don't see whatever people like believe in things like
[3:47:21.040 --> 3:47:25.200]  this because it's extreme and people you know they'd be like looking for extreme things to believe
[3:47:25.200 --> 3:47:29.520]  they'd believe they would imagine this guy was trying to set you up that's actually pretty common
[3:47:29.520 --> 3:47:35.520]  folks do stuff like that you know it's like all the cases of black kids or jewish kids painting
[3:47:35.520 --> 3:47:40.080]  swastikas on their own dormitory and they get caught i mean it's basically the same thing so
[3:47:40.080 --> 3:47:44.480]  so so he's ramming you with it and going back from memory didn't he start grabbing you himself
[3:47:44.480 --> 3:47:49.520]  or something well he tried to initiate me to hit him first he put his finger in my face and i told
[3:47:49.520 --> 3:47:53.280]  him to get out of my face because i knew where he was trying to do is trying to get me to hit him
[3:47:53.280 --> 3:47:57.920]  right in front of secret service in front of the police and i basically try to notify the authority
[3:47:57.920 --> 3:48:01.760]  figure to let him know that this guy's trying to provoke something to to prevent anything in the
[3:48:01.760 --> 3:48:09.680]  future as i was about to do so he coordinated the attack and um basically um that's when the whole
[3:48:09.680 --> 3:48:14.960]  adventure began with me okay now now going from what i heard from luke and others in you the secret
[3:48:14.960 --> 3:48:19.360]  service and police they went ahead and went along with the lie how did you defeat them in court
[3:48:20.000 --> 3:48:25.840]  well i mean the prosecutor himself wasn't really the brightest person he was a um a black man from
[3:48:25.840 --> 3:48:31.520]  harvard that they that believe that he um the supervisors try to use his venue star um you
[3:48:31.520 --> 3:48:36.720]  know take on this high profile case but everything i witnessed he had basically built my case i mean
[3:48:36.720 --> 3:48:41.760]  one secret service guy said i did not over resist arrest uh police officer said i did but feature
[3:48:41.760 --> 3:48:46.560]  said he tried to handcuff me another police officer said the feature line everyone basically had
[3:48:46.560 --> 3:48:50.240]  so much to be clear then let's be clear because i was getting the second hand from luke and less
[3:48:50.800 --> 3:48:54.880]  the secret service didn't lie the newer cops lied okay well that's good for the secret service then
[3:48:55.440 --> 3:48:59.680]  right the secret service guy basically said that i did not resist arrest and um you know
[3:48:59.680 --> 3:49:05.360]  because he's not going to lose his job lying okay okay that's exactly exactly and um basically
[3:49:05.360 --> 3:49:10.160]  the cop couldn't corroborate anything everything was just a big mess the only thing this guy had
[3:49:10.160 --> 3:49:16.960]  with a wheelchair a book with uh children's pictures on it and basically um maureen herself
[3:49:17.520 --> 3:49:23.040]  um you know poor child coming in with a girl scout uniform a little puppy um you trying to
[3:49:23.040 --> 3:49:28.800]  basically uh appeal to the juries emotions they wasn't working the jury was seeing what was going on
[3:49:28.800 --> 3:49:32.880]  you know took us a day to pick a jury that looked smart enough to understand this kind of stuff and
[3:49:32.880 --> 3:49:37.360]  not be manipulated by emotional appeals and i think my lawyer did a good job and was a good
[3:49:37.360 --> 3:49:43.520]  jury they're calling it an acquittal did i mean um well were you found not guilty or how did this
[3:49:43.520 --> 3:49:48.000]  play out right i was trying not guilty and look for charges and try to get me resistant yeah we'll
[3:49:48.000 --> 3:49:54.640]  see how they spin it i mean i mean an acquittal is not guilty but they it the average person
[3:49:54.640 --> 3:50:00.080]  doesn't know what that means it needs to say not guilty set up look you need to sue this guy you
[3:50:00.080 --> 3:50:05.120]  need to sue them all gary they're going to continue to go around in corners with the wheelchair jumping
[3:50:05.120 --> 3:50:09.200]  out at people you heard her you know you're walking down the street with your family and
[3:50:09.200 --> 3:50:13.520]  there's a guy waiting with a wheelchair around the corner i mean you need to go after this guy
[3:50:14.080 --> 3:50:19.760]  yeah that would be definitely um you know it's it's a dream to go at them and i'll you put
[3:50:19.760 --> 3:50:24.880]  everything that i have uh just to make him understand that you know you can't do stuff like this
[3:50:24.880 --> 3:50:30.720]  so were they angry when you were found not guilty um well the guy himself was trying to
[3:50:30.720 --> 3:50:34.880]  stand me down the whole time in the courtroom trying to act like a tough guy trying to intimidate
[3:50:34.880 --> 3:50:40.000]  my lawyer stepping hard to him when he was asked to leave the stand he attacked my daughter it's

[3:54:12.000 --> 3:54:17.360]  german talus found not guilty of a jury by his peers that's why i have mainstream news with
[3:54:17.360 --> 3:54:22.160]  their trump the american bar association wants to abolish juries and the lawyers can really rob you
[3:54:23.120 --> 3:54:26.960]  and uh in england they're getting rid of juries like i want to get to that at the very end of
[3:54:26.960 --> 3:54:31.040]  the show here in a moment but i was just talking to jason bermas who interviewed you first last
[3:54:31.040 --> 3:54:38.160]  night literally she had a real puppy in a girl scout outfit i mean have you to heard this father
[3:54:38.160 --> 3:54:42.720]  with his daughter on shawna hand it he was so with him whispering going tell them they hit you all
[3:54:42.720 --> 3:54:48.720]  right and i mean german this is getting insane you're saying it was a real puppy or a stuffed puppy
[3:54:48.720 --> 3:54:54.880]  on the stand i was crazy um well the day before the she took the stand we were looking at a picture
[3:54:54.880 --> 3:55:00.960]  of her with a girl scout uniform holding a picture of lower boss smiling um well there was a system
[3:55:00.960 --> 3:55:04.480]  with a joke she said well where's the puppy the only thing that's really missing is the puppy
[3:55:04.480 --> 3:55:09.840]  you know this is disgusting and next day she really comes in with a puppy and she was actually
[3:55:09.840 --> 3:55:14.800]  talking about how puppies help with confidence that and the prosecutor was asking a question such as
[3:55:15.360 --> 3:55:18.560]  what kind of what other puppies do you have you have a terry i believe you like playing with
[3:55:18.560 --> 3:55:23.360]  you tell you like are you against the will i mean i confront the drugs are how his second
[3:55:23.360 --> 3:55:27.920]  command got caught shipping and heroin and cocaine i confront him with the roiders article
[3:55:28.640 --> 3:55:35.040]  and he this is in police state to the takeover and he says the baby got hurt and he goes baby
[3:55:35.040 --> 3:55:41.520]  trying to you and everybody's one baby in the audience and they go drugs hurt the babies and
[3:55:41.520 --> 3:55:49.360]  that's like psych warfare the baby the puppy german talus is evil so so the jury saw right
[3:55:49.360 --> 3:55:54.240]  through this bizarre behavior he saw right through it um we could we we did a great job
[3:55:54.240 --> 3:55:57.840]  picking the jury you could really see the people who really in touch with themselves and could
[3:55:57.840 --> 3:56:03.280]  understand facts and um they remember we did a good job in picking the jury i believe that you
[3:56:03.280 --> 3:56:08.960]  know people once they have an emotional appeal they just the their mind is not showing up they
[3:56:08.960 --> 3:56:14.320]  follow the animal instinct and they go with um what sounds good as opposed to what's underneath
[3:56:14.320 --> 3:56:20.240]  the surface i had my london guardian article here and it's very upsetting to me because i wanted to
[3:56:20.240 --> 3:56:26.640]  show it for the show ended where they're ending juries in england and they try to make you not
[3:56:26.640 --> 3:56:32.160]  take one here it is court allows first juryless criminal trial and then you actually read that
[3:56:32.160 --> 3:56:36.880]  they've had thousands this is just one where the people tried to sue demanding a criminal trial
[3:56:36.880 --> 3:56:43.360]  with juries and they said no and it's a secret trial court allows first juryless criminal trial
[3:56:43.360 --> 3:56:48.080]  london guardian so for years they've been trying to force you not to take them but but but this is
[3:56:48.080 --> 3:56:53.120]  one that was found in court they say no more juries so well thank god you got your jury and as the
[3:56:53.120 --> 3:56:57.120]  people stop trusting the government more and more uh they're going to try to get rid of juries so we
[3:56:57.120 --> 3:57:02.160]  gotta fight for those i know it's extreme and i'm evil and probably a terrorist because i believe
[3:57:02.160 --> 3:57:06.560]  we should be able to protest the army now says that's terrorism and i believe in the first
[3:57:06.560 --> 3:57:12.880]  amendment and juries i mean i'm so evil uh well mr talus we are change.org i'm just glad the

[3:57:29.200 --> 3:57:35.280]  what he did he left the courtroom after he um you know he was dismissed as a non-credible witness
[3:57:35.920 --> 3:57:43.040]  and um i guess um i guess he's probably um biting his nails well we don't know he's doing that but
[3:57:43.840 --> 3:57:49.440]  he certainly he certainly lied about you certainly lied about you right it definitely did either i
[3:57:49.440 --> 3:57:53.360]  really don't know what he's up to but based upon the character that he is that he would use his
[3:57:53.360 --> 3:57:58.640]  daughter as a weapon i believe that he's not doing something productive right now well he really has
[3:57:58.640 --> 3:58:03.360]  savaged you and you need to demand a retraction from him but uh you've been found not guilty in
