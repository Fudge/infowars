[00:00:04.833 --> 00:00:09.655]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.655 --> 00:00:11.236]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.236 --> 00:00:12.797]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.797 --> 00:00:16.979]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.979 --> 00:00:21.041]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.387 --> 00:00:37.999]  I'm in!
[00:01:03.976 --> 00:01:04.717]  We're good.
[00:01:50.681 --> 00:01:54.523]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:01:54.523 --> 00:01:57.205]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Friday edition.
[00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:04.012]  It is the 19th day of June, 2009.
[00:02:04.012 --> 00:02:08.274]  Big radio show lined up for you today.
[00:02:08.274 --> 00:02:16.258]  We've got Bob Chapman for our once-a-week economic visit joining us to cover what's happening in the markets and the economy.
[00:02:16.258 --> 00:02:19.579]  And boy, a lot of big developments since we had him on last week.
[00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.941]  That'll be a jam-packed and informative hour.
[00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.742]  Then Dr. Neil Carman will be in studio.
[00:02:26.517 --> 00:02:37.563]  With another guest, a local anti-fluoride activist, to chronicle what's really in sodium fluoride, because that's a catch-all term for a whole bunch of chemicals they're putting in the water supply.
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.861]  Under international mandate.
[00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:45.523]  And Ray Nadler will be joining us also in studio.
[00:02:45.523 --> 00:02:52.546]  So that is coming up in the second half of the third hour into the fourth hour.
[00:02:52.546 --> 00:02:57.128]  And then Gary Tallis, nicknamed German Tallis.
[00:02:57.128 --> 00:02:58.789]  Remember Fox News and the
[00:03:00.583 --> 00:03:12.566]  New York Post and others said that he savagely ran up for no reason and began attacking, like some type of vampiric goblin, a woman in a wheelchair.
[00:03:12.566 --> 00:03:27.490]  Now, it turned out the girl in the wheelchair was the daughter of a neocon developer, construction individual, with interesting ties to, well, quite a few interesting characters in and around 9-11.
[00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.511]  And We Are Change was at an event in New York.
[00:03:30.427 --> 00:03:48.456]  Now about a year ago, and simply were trying to ask questions of world leaders politely when they were assaulted, they said, by the girl's father, who then ran across the street with a wheelchair, ramming it into them, saying, he is attacking her, he is attacking my daughter.
[00:03:49.275 --> 00:03:56.140]  And the police wouldn't release the surveillance camera tapes, they wouldn't release the street cameras that happened to be on the scene.
[00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.984]  And I had all these We Are Chain witnesses saying, it's incredible, he did nothing.
[00:04:00.984 --> 00:04:03.425]  They just came out of the blue and attacked.
[00:04:03.425 --> 00:04:09.310]  Well, the Secret Service testified against him, the police testified against him, but the New York jury
[00:04:10.763 --> 00:04:12.304]  Knows what that means.
[00:04:12.304 --> 00:04:13.084]  They've learned.
[00:04:13.084 --> 00:04:15.345]  Oh, that means it's a lie.
[00:04:15.345 --> 00:04:17.807]  Secret Service says one thing, it's the other.
[00:04:17.807 --> 00:04:19.928]  Police say one thing, it's the other.
[00:04:19.928 --> 00:04:24.130]  Juries are meant to be that final last line of defense against tyranny.
[00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.170]  And he was found not guilty.
[00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.312]  And now a lot of you have opened yourselves up for serious liability.
[00:04:28.312 --> 00:04:32.254]  New York Post hurriedly did a retraction yesterday.
[00:04:32.254 --> 00:04:32.834]  Not good enough.
[00:04:37.253 --> 00:04:41.616]  So that's coming up in the last 30 minutes of the show today.
[00:04:41.616 --> 00:04:42.997]  Vindicated!
[00:04:42.997 --> 00:04:44.818]  Gary took my advice and others advice.
[00:04:44.818 --> 00:04:46.399]  I said go all the way to the mat.
[00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:48.161]  Let them falsely convict you.
[00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:49.602]  Get an appeal.
[00:04:49.602 --> 00:04:50.602]  You've got the witnesses.
[00:04:50.602 --> 00:04:51.503]  You're telling the truth.
[00:04:51.503 --> 00:04:53.124]  This is an obvious setup.
[00:04:53.124 --> 00:04:54.725]  PSYOP.
[00:04:54.725 --> 00:04:55.666]  One of their favorites.
[00:04:55.666 --> 00:04:58.048]  Fox News is in trouble on this one.
[00:04:58.048 --> 00:04:58.908]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:58.908 --> 00:04:59.389]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.051]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:06.793]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:05:06.793 --> 00:05:09.754]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:05:09.754 --> 00:05:12.795]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:05:12.795 --> 00:05:17.517]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:05:17.697 --> 00:05:17.917]  We're good.
[00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:43.792]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, freeze-dried, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:05:43.792 --> 00:05:50.716]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:05:50.716 --> 00:05:55.158]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:55.158 --> 00:05:56.299]  Take action today.
[00:05:56.299 --> 00:06:00.922]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:06:00.922 --> 00:06:03.483]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:06:04.116 --> 00:06:06.740]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:13.751]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:20.896]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:20.896 --> 00:06:22.878]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:22.878 --> 00:06:25.381]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:25.381 --> 00:06:36.333]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.622]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:38.622 --> 00:06:40.484]  It's about a one world government.
[00:06:40.484 --> 00:06:47.391]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:47.391 --> 00:06:55.660]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.241]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.241 --> 00:06:58.423]  The people strike back.
[00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:01.591]  Economy have you down?
[00:07:01.591 --> 00:07:03.272]  Scared you might lose your job?
[00:07:03.272 --> 00:07:05.353]  Worried how you will provide for your family?
[00:07:05.353 --> 00:07:07.475]  Do you worry where your money will come from?
[00:07:07.475 --> 00:07:10.797]  You know that the economy is getting worse, but there is hope.
[00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:15.320]  Robert Beadle's new book, Here's What You Do, tells you what to do and how to do it.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.883]  Even a 10-year-old can figure it out after reading this 72-page book.
[00:07:18.883 --> 00:07:19.783]  And the best part?
[00:07:19.783 --> 00:07:21.805]  This book is priced under $10.
[00:07:21.805 --> 00:07:23.726]  Don't be the victim, be a victor!
[00:07:23.726 --> 00:07:25.827]  Go to hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:07:25.827 --> 00:07:27.709]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:07:27.709 --> 00:07:28.989]  Again, hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:30.410]  We're good to go.
[00:08:00.871 --> 00:08:06.454]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:32.978 --> 00:08:41.703]  Okay, coming up at the last 30 minutes of the show today, the New York Post has had to do a retraction.
[00:08:41.703 --> 00:08:45.986]  Fox News has not done one yet, but they need to.
[00:08:45.986 --> 00:08:49.728]  They reported as if it was an absolute convicted fact.
[00:08:49.728 --> 00:08:52.330]  They didn't say alleged.
[00:08:52.330 --> 00:09:00.855]  They said a 9-11 truther savagely, for no reason, ran out of the darkness and attacked a girl in a wheelchair.
[00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:07.581]  Gary Talus, goes by German Talus.
[00:09:07.581 --> 00:09:15.870]  And we had all these We Are Chain witnesses, We Are Chain's witnesses, saying it was crazy.
[00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:21.537]  The guy just came across the street and came over and started screaming at us, ramming his daughter into us, screaming, don't attack my daughter.
[00:09:22.571 --> 00:09:26.295]  And the Secret Service and police came over and said, no, you attacked her.
[00:09:26.295 --> 00:09:31.219]  We're going to charge you with all these felonies of attacking a poor girl in a wheelchair.
[00:09:31.219 --> 00:09:39.027]  And then they went and seized all the cameras and all the surveillance camera footage from the hotel and said it didn't exist.
[00:09:39.027 --> 00:09:44.772]  Well, the jury heard all that and found Mr. Tallis not guilty.
[00:09:44.772 --> 00:09:46.414]  Now, why is that an important issue?
[00:09:47.552 --> 00:09:54.053]  In the United States, they are proposing to not allow jury trials in many types of court cases now.
[00:09:54.053 --> 00:10:00.314]  And in England, it's already been put into effect.
[00:10:00.314 --> 00:10:05.075]  And I had the London Guardian headline about how they're getting rid of juries.
[00:10:05.075 --> 00:10:10.536]  And they even have secret trials now in England, the same thing being adopted here.
[00:10:10.536 --> 00:10:16.377]  Kind of like Obama announces cyber security to take over the entire web and end freedom on the internet as it's known.
[00:10:17.688 --> 00:10:19.568]  England now has announced they're adopting.
[00:10:19.568 --> 00:10:26.310]  Australia is adopting and saying this means an end to free speech on the internet.
[00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:36.551]  The government itself says we're putting in Chinese, communist Chinese style net censorship.
[00:10:36.551 --> 00:10:44.653]  This is on record.
[00:10:44.653 --> 00:10:44.873]  So,
[00:10:46.897 --> 00:10:52.540]  Our journey towards complete and absolute tyranny is accelerating right now.
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:11:05.408]  Coming up later in the next hour, we're going to start simulcasting for three hours today at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:11:05.408 --> 00:11:10.611]  Headline, Ron Paul slams Federal Reserve.
[00:11:10.611 --> 00:11:13.012]  New dictatorial powers.
[00:11:13.012 --> 00:11:16.034]  And he did that on MSNBC yesterday.
[00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:47.664]  Remember the article that Paul Watson wrote yesterday that I ask everybody to get out to as many people as they can because without even a whimper, certainly not a bang, the White House has released the text of the new legislation they want to pass by the end of this session coming up in the fall to not just let the Federal Reserve steal any amount of money it wants, but to come in and not just forcibly take over GM, Ford,
[00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:49.858]  Chrysler.
[00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:58.112]  But to take over dealerships, to take over restaurants, to take over public and private lands.
[00:11:58.112 --> 00:12:06.915]  And notice the Supreme Court ruled years ago private interest or government interest can take whatever they want, not even for the public good, just if the government feels like it.
[00:12:06.915 --> 00:12:18.479]  And private interest can even give campaign contributions, starting bidding wars, to mayors and governors and others to come and take your property and give it to them.
[00:12:18.479 --> 00:12:20.200]  That's the real outrage
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.903]  in the New London Kelo decision.
[00:12:23.903 --> 00:12:25.624]  And this isn't Alex Jones saying this.
[00:12:25.624 --> 00:12:41.538]  The Washington Times, the Washington Post, the LA Times, all reported Wednesday and Thursday that, oh, this gives the Federal Reserve the power to take over any industry, any company, any business, or anything they want in the economy.
[00:12:41.538 --> 00:12:44.200]  This is a dictatorship of the private bankers.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:44.821]  But now,
[00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:52.844]  Ron Paul has come out and talked about it as well and said the Federal Reserve has more power than Congress under this system.
[00:12:56.872 --> 00:13:05.600]  Just like the World Trade Organization was given more power, Congress voted away its authority back in the mid-1990s to a private World Trade Organization.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.923]  This is what globalization and New World Order is all about.
[00:13:08.923 --> 00:13:16.329]  It is where private corporate interests create international private corporate quasi-governmental bodies.
[00:13:16.329 --> 00:13:21.074]  They're privately owned but have governmental power, and then lobby the nation states
[00:13:24.867 --> 00:13:37.651]  Japan, Germany, England, the United States and others to cede or hand their authority over to the new multinational private conglomerates via treaties.
[00:13:37.651 --> 00:13:38.611]  That's what this is.
[00:13:38.611 --> 00:13:40.232]  GATT and NAFTA are treaties.
[00:13:40.232 --> 00:13:42.512]  The World Trade Organization is a treaty.
[00:13:42.512 --> 00:13:43.913]  NATO is a treaty.
[00:13:43.913 --> 00:13:45.473]  The United Nations is a treaty.
[00:13:45.473 --> 00:13:47.294]  We are treaty signatories to it.
[00:13:47.294 --> 00:13:53.576]  Then we sign other treaties like UNESCO saying the UN runs college and high school accredited
[00:13:55.285 --> 00:13:56.126]  We're good to go.
[00:14:22.873 --> 00:14:30.539]  And now, because the world's been operating for at least half a century under this system, the banks are just coming out in the open.
[00:14:30.539 --> 00:14:36.264]  And saying, we are now going to be the bank of the world.
[00:14:36.264 --> 00:14:38.265]  And you are going to pay your taxes to us.
[00:14:38.265 --> 00:14:44.210]  And I know I repeat this day in and day out, because this is all that matters!
[00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:50.175]  Congress, through continutive government, through National Security Acts, has been made to be ceremonial.
[00:14:53.669 --> 00:15:11.649]  And reading the Club of Rome and CFR and Trilateral Commission and all these documents, on air over the years, and making films like Endgame, they had said they were going to create a new bank of the world that set carbon tax rates, environmental policies, world tax rates,
[00:15:12.807 --> 00:15:27.550]  For the OECD, Organization of Economic Cooperative Development, and that through the central government, through the continuity of government control grid they would administer, but at least with the illusion that the national government still ran something.
[00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:40.792]  They are jumping ahead and over that directly to the final phase of the regional governorship banks like the Federal Reserve, as part of a larger global consortium, openly ruling everything
[00:15:42.662 --> 00:16:07.593]  It's just incredible and so I'm going to continue to hammer this and hammer this and hammer this and hammer this and hammer this until enough of the American people are aware of this is happening so they can inform others so we can get critical mass going so that people realize this is a bloodless economic total coup d'etat with a open new form of government being founded.
[00:16:07.593 --> 00:16:10.755]  I mean in 1913 when the Federal Reserve took over the issuance of currency and credit
[00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:15.900]  A fourth branch of government that was privately owned and controlled was born.
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.561]  It is now rendering obsolete.
[00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:24.303]  It is now decommissioning, wrecking, splitting, decimating, annihilating.
[00:16:24.303 --> 00:16:26.143]  Let's say there's four train lines.
[00:16:26.143 --> 00:16:30.825]  Judicial, the courts, legislative, the Congress, and executive, the presidency.
[00:16:30.825 --> 00:16:34.106]  Those are four railway tracks going in the same direction.
[00:16:34.106 --> 00:16:37.667]  Next to it, in 1913, they laid down the private fellow reserve line.
[00:16:38.527 --> 00:16:56.504]  They transferred more and more power over to that new fourth line of government, privately owned and run, and now they don't want the people remembering the legitimate three branches of government, so that power can be transferred back over to that, and so they've got one of those rail splitters
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:09.046]  Being drug over the other three lines, tearing up all the railroad ties, and dragging off the rail lines, so that those three branches of government are rendered absolutely impotent.
[00:17:09.046 --> 00:17:11.127]  Not even impotent, abolished.
[00:17:11.127 --> 00:17:12.667]  Executively.
[00:17:12.667 --> 00:17:26.694]  So, first thing the bankers did after they laid down their fourth rail, was they transferred most of the power, because that was the first step, out of the judicial and legislative, into the executive, fraudulently.
[00:17:29.522 --> 00:17:35.967]  And then now they're just removing any authority from those three branches altogether.
[00:17:35.967 --> 00:17:46.476]  And of course there was a true fourth rail, not the fraudulent counterfeit fourth rail that the bankers created, that was states' rights in the states.
[00:17:46.476 --> 00:17:53.602]  But the proper way to describe it is, the foundation, the bedrock, the rail beds,
[00:17:55.097 --> 00:18:05.262]  on which the three branches of government were laid and built, the gravel beds, was the states, the Confederation, creating the federal government.
[00:18:05.262 --> 00:18:08.744]  And so the feds have annihilated that as well.
[00:18:09.918 --> 00:18:33.559]  So the offshore banks get in power in 1913, they come in, they take over the states, they render the states vassals of the federal government, then they start mashing all the federal government's power so it's easily controlled and can be administered more easily through the fraud in the executive, and now they're transferring all that executive power that's ill-gotten and ill-gained into the private hands of the private Federal Reserve.
[00:18:34.554 --> 00:18:46.257]  Which itself is a regional governorship of the world federalist system run by the private central banks who issue the world's currencies and credit and so they control the planet.
[00:18:46.257 --> 00:18:53.159]  And that's why they're trying to shut down counties and cities and states and universities and businesses that are issuing their own currencies.
[00:18:53.159 --> 00:18:58.460]  When you walk into a Walmart and buy a gift card
[00:19:00.481 --> 00:19:07.848]  That is a form of alternative currency, but it's based and denominated in Federal Reserve notes so the Feds don't go after it.
[00:19:07.848 --> 00:19:18.599]  But a lot of cities and counties have been issuing for decades their own script that is accepted and used for barter at restaurants and coffee shops and auto repair shops and golf courses and what have you.
[00:19:19.795 --> 00:19:23.677]  The Feds are raiding and arresting these people all over the country right now.
[00:19:23.677 --> 00:19:26.839]  They're arresting people trying to barter silver.
[00:19:26.839 --> 00:19:29.960]  They're arresting people paying with $2 bills.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:47.429]  They've got the clerks looking for people using alternative currencies so much that when somebody walks in with a $2 bill, the Declaration of Independence on the back, which is Federal Reserve Note, you are arrested, you are charged, and in some cases you are convicted.
[00:19:47.429 --> 00:19:48.730]  The juries are so dumb.
[00:19:49.864 --> 00:19:55.008]  When the Feds come in and say this is illegal, they say, you're going to jail, buddy.
[00:19:55.008 --> 00:19:57.749]  You're not allowed to use Federal Reserve notes that we say.
[00:19:57.749 --> 00:19:59.691]  Those are illegal as well.
[00:19:59.691 --> 00:20:00.471]  Mind control.
[00:20:00.471 --> 00:20:02.813]  This is Alex Jones for American Tax Settlement.

[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:07.021]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:07.021 --> 00:21:12.903]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:21:12.903 --> 00:21:19.044]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:21:19.384 --> 00:21:21.365]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:21:21.365 --> 00:21:23.827]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:21:23.827 --> 00:21:37.014]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:21:37.014 --> 00:21:38.695]  It's not about left or right.
[00:21:38.695 --> 00:21:40.556]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:21:40.556 --> 00:21:46.780]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:22:59.758 --> 00:23:02.520]  The phone rings and the questions are asked.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:03.781]  I've been so sick.
[00:23:03.781 --> 00:23:05.462]  Will the life change tea help me?
[00:23:05.462 --> 00:23:07.324]  Our answer is always the same.
[00:23:07.324 --> 00:23:13.448]  Yes, toxins and chemicals from food, water and air are attacking you this very moment.

[00:23:19.333 --> 00:23:23.836]  Many companies use gimmicks and misleading free trials for their campaign.
[00:23:23.836 --> 00:23:24.817]  We use results.
[00:23:25.237 --> 00:23:29.998]  Life Change Tease formula created by a PhD has been around for over 20 years.
[00:23:29.998 --> 00:23:34.620]  There are things happening in the world that are unseen and not healthy.
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:38.481]  The public has reached its all-time record for chronic sickness.
[00:23:38.481 --> 00:23:42.382]  This atrocity won't change unless you call us right now.
[00:23:42.382 --> 00:23:42.982]  Our number is 928-308-0408.

[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:29.484]  So this is how the Republic falls.
[00:24:29.484 --> 00:24:35.808]  The rusty chains of prison moons are shattered by the sun.
[00:24:35.808 --> 00:24:43.352]  I walk a road, horizons change, the tournament's begun.
[00:24:43.352 --> 00:24:50.197]  The purple piper plays his tune, the choir softly sing.
[00:24:53.359 --> 00:25:01.041]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:01.621]  to 3 p.m.
[00:25:01.621 --> 00:25:03.001]  We're here live.
[00:25:03.001 --> 00:25:06.562]  Central Standard Time blasting out on the AM and FM dial.
[00:25:06.562 --> 00:25:08.482]  Global shortwave.
[00:25:08.482 --> 00:25:09.622]  Satellite internet.
[00:25:09.622 --> 00:25:12.263]  XM retransmits us four hours on Saturdays.
[00:25:12.263 --> 00:25:17.244]  We're appreciative of that.
[00:25:17.244 --> 00:25:19.304]  Really growing, thanks to all of you spreading the word.
[00:25:20.606 --> 00:25:35.649]  But the reason the private offshore banks are able to get away with this, because it's so incredibly outrageous, coming up we are going to be breaking that down with Bob Chapman next hour, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[00:25:35.649 --> 00:25:39.350]  Ron Paul slams Federal Reserve's new dictatorial powers.
[00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:44.451]  Congressman tells MSNBC that the very entity responsible for the economic crisis
[00:25:45.535 --> 00:25:48.398]  is now more powerful than Congress.
[00:25:48.398 --> 00:25:51.100]  Now that's what Ron Paul said yesterday evening.
[00:25:51.100 --> 00:26:04.592]  We said yesterday morning in our article breaking this down, at PrisonPlanet.com, Obama regulatory reform plan officially establishes banking dictatorship in the United States.
[00:26:07.714 --> 00:26:10.315]  And I've even gotten emails from people going, oh, it's not that bad.
[00:26:10.315 --> 00:26:11.855]  Okay, let me explain something.
[00:26:11.855 --> 00:26:26.718]  The banker bailout bill of last year said the Federal Reserve cannot be audited, cannot be looked into, none of the banks that are given the money can be investigated, the money can go to offshore banks, the money can go to China to pay them off to implement global carbon taxes.
[00:26:26.718 --> 00:26:28.398]  That was in USA Today.
[00:26:28.398 --> 00:26:34.680]  They can do whatever they want, they're an offshore private corporation, and you don't have any say, and it's unlimited money.
[00:26:37.932 --> 00:26:41.695]  They said that they would immediately spend the trillions of dollars, not $700 billion.
[00:26:41.695 --> 00:26:47.760]  They admitted that was just a really big number to put out there to you.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.643]  The $700 billion was just a really big number.
[00:26:51.643 --> 00:26:54.706]  Actually small compared to the real number.
[00:26:54.706 --> 00:26:57.869]  Just so people could quantify that it wasn't an unlimited amount.
[00:26:57.869 --> 00:27:02.933]  But Bloomberg reports $14.8 trillion in the first seven months since that bailout.
[00:27:02.933 --> 00:27:04.274]  And that number's a month old.
[00:27:04.274 --> 00:27:05.295]  We'll be getting new numbers soon.
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.401]  It makes me so angry.
[00:27:10.401 --> 00:27:13.364]  I can hardly even continue this radio show right now.
[00:27:13.364 --> 00:27:17.006]  I'm serious.
[00:27:17.006 --> 00:27:18.548]  I mean, this is so outrageous.
[00:27:18.548 --> 00:27:37.863]  People should be in the streets everywhere demanding that the Federal Reserve chairman be arrested, that all these criminal offshore thugs that have come in and engaged in a corporate takeover, and then use the country like their own private credit card, running up the debt to the stratosphere in your names and your children's names!
[00:27:41.075 --> 00:27:43.236]  And so what new power could they get?
[00:27:43.236 --> 00:27:48.299]  Day one they said, give us the bailout money and we will get the economy going and get the loans going.
[00:27:48.299 --> 00:27:51.701]  And now interest rates in reality are higher.
[00:27:51.701 --> 00:27:54.082]  People are like, wait a minute, interest rates are at zero.
[00:27:54.082 --> 00:27:55.743]  I don't mean interest rates for the banks.
[00:27:55.743 --> 00:27:58.245]  I mean the real interest rates are up.
[00:27:58.245 --> 00:27:59.966]  Less loans are being made.
[00:27:59.966 --> 00:28:04.649]  That's official numbers.
[00:28:04.649 --> 00:28:05.249]  Comprende?
[00:28:08.956 --> 00:28:11.097]  The economy is in free fall.
[00:28:11.097 --> 00:28:16.600]  It's depression level already, and it's going to be unbelievably bad.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:25.785]  But the globalists are busy taking the tens of trillions they've stolen, speculating in the stock market, so some of the stocks are up, and that's fooling some of the people out there.
[00:28:25.785 --> 00:28:26.646]  Heaven help you!
[00:28:26.646 --> 00:28:33.809]  The real economy is dying, and everything is being fed into the casino stock market.
[00:28:33.809 --> 00:28:34.750]  It's all paper.
[00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.651]  It's all derivative crud.
[00:28:36.651 --> 00:28:37.511]  It's a fraud.
[00:28:37.511 --> 00:28:38.272]  It's a scam.
[00:28:40.643 --> 00:28:41.644]  And the bankers know that.
[00:28:41.644 --> 00:28:45.706]  They've got to take all these trillions and get real assets, and a lot of people aren't selling.
[00:28:45.706 --> 00:28:46.966]  Oh, GM, you're not going to sell.
[00:28:46.966 --> 00:28:53.049]  We'll just federalize you and sell you off to foreign corporations.
[00:28:53.049 --> 00:28:54.070]  Oh, your steel mills.
[00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:55.991]  The Feds say that's part of vital infrastructure.
[00:28:55.991 --> 00:28:59.813]  They're seizing it and handing it over to foreign interest.
[00:28:59.813 --> 00:29:01.414]  Shareholders in the private Federal Reserve.
[00:29:02.386 --> 00:29:09.352]  So see, what new power could they get if they were already given total secrecy and unlimited funds back in October of last year?
[00:29:09.352 --> 00:29:14.576]  The next phase would be to call for a new Bank of the World with new regulatory powers over the planet.
[00:29:14.576 --> 00:29:18.659]  And they've now done that.
[00:29:18.659 --> 00:29:26.065]  And so their regional bank, the Federal Reserve, has to have the unlimited powers now so we can be ruled by this offshore behemoth.
[00:29:28.041 --> 00:29:36.004]  And so they're gonna run the Congress, the White House, all private industries, the bills, states, anything and everything connected to the economy.
[00:29:36.004 --> 00:29:37.665]  They are over it.
[00:29:37.665 --> 00:29:45.027]  And they got paramilitary enforcers ready to come into your factory, your business, your restaurant, your car dealership, and take it over.
[00:29:45.027 --> 00:29:50.969]  They are gonna steal, physically, at the point of a gun, everything this country's built.
[00:29:50.969 --> 00:29:52.370]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:54.891]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.891 --> 00:29:57.592]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:02.306 --> 00:31:05.108]  A new world order.
[00:31:05.108 --> 00:31:10.010]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:12.851]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:31:12.851 --> 00:31:15.633]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:31:15.633 --> 00:31:18.034]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:31:18.795 --> 00:31:26.122]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:31:29.144 --> 00:31:34.588]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[00:31:44.274 --> 00:31:45.235]  They're after power.

[00:32:02.286 --> 00:32:05.227]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[00:32:05.227 --> 00:32:07.468]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[00:32:07.468 --> 00:32:08.449]  Here's the story.
[00:32:08.449 --> 00:32:13.252]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[00:32:13.252 --> 00:32:14.512]  Now here's the bad news.
[00:32:14.512 --> 00:32:19.595]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands for free services and procedures.
[00:32:19.595 --> 00:32:21.416]  Medicare and Medicaid are already bankrupt.
[00:32:21.696 --> 00:32:22.317]  We're good to go.
[00:32:43.015 --> 00:32:48.198]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies, and it's flat out the best course of its kind.
[00:32:48.198 --> 00:32:52.319]  I recommend you visit this important new website at MakeHerbalMedicines.com.
[00:32:52.319 --> 00:32:55.661]  That's MakeHerbalMedicines.com, or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[00:32:55.661 --> 00:33:04.025]  Man thinks, cause he rules the earth, he can do it as he please.
[00:33:04.025 --> 00:33:06.266]  And if things don't change soon,
[00:33:19.572 --> 00:33:21.732]  Look, we'll cover the financial stuff next hour.
[00:33:21.732 --> 00:33:26.894]  And I don't want to sound like a broken record on it.
[00:33:26.894 --> 00:33:30.555]  It's hardly anybody gets how big this is.
[00:33:30.555 --> 00:33:36.197]  That they've stolen more than the GDP in seven months, 14.8 trillion.
[00:33:36.197 --> 00:33:38.938]  I mean, they're just destroying everything.
[00:33:38.938 --> 00:33:39.998]  Do you know what this means?
[00:33:41.863 --> 00:33:44.726]  And I've got all these economic numbers coming in.
[00:33:44.726 --> 00:33:50.110]  Housing prices dropped by 40% in New York.
[00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:54.354]  Another one, New York State unemployment soars a 33-year high.
[00:33:54.354 --> 00:33:56.816]  The government's saying it's 10%.
[00:33:56.816 --> 00:34:04.302]  Every economist we have on, top economist, say it's 20%.
[00:34:04.302 --> 00:34:07.025]  And they're saying it's going to go to more like 30 in the next few years.
[00:34:07.025 --> 00:34:07.926]  You know what that means?
[00:34:07.926 --> 00:34:09.407]  That's higher than the Depression.
[00:34:11.294 --> 00:34:17.422]  And they're openly taking the stimulus money and hiring youth brigades that march around in red and black uniforms?
[00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:21.928]  And the New York Times reports they're hiring felons for the youth brigades?
[00:34:21.928 --> 00:34:24.672]  I mean, I'm living in the Outer Limits or Twilight Zone!
[00:34:24.672 --> 00:34:26.374]  I'm sick of it!
[00:34:26.374 --> 00:34:28.256]  I got children that live in this country!
[00:34:35.737 --> 00:34:37.018]  It's really happening!
[00:34:37.018 --> 00:34:47.221]  Everything the old-timers warned us about with the New World Order because they were in and out of government, they were in the military, they saw this being set up, they read the documents.
[00:34:47.221 --> 00:34:51.403]  Let me just tell you some of the news I've got here in front of me.
[00:34:51.403 --> 00:34:56.665]  Coming up, Ron Paul slams Federal Reserve's new dictatorial powers, makes the point it's a dictatorship of the Fed.
[00:34:57.830 --> 00:34:59.974]  That's what it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:59.974 --> 00:35:02.158]  Thank God Ron Paul recognized it.
[00:35:02.158 --> 00:35:07.308]  I've been freaking out the last two days for somebody to recognize this and finally he comes out and agrees with me.
[00:35:11.215 --> 00:35:15.318]  Literally, other quote Patriot sites are like, it's not that bad!
[00:35:15.318 --> 00:35:22.044]  What do you think it is when they're in Time and Newsweek calling for a Bank of the World to quote, knock the heads of the American people?
[00:35:22.044 --> 00:35:23.065]  That's a quote!
[00:35:23.065 --> 00:35:24.766]  Knock our heads!
[00:35:24.766 --> 00:35:27.168]  A world government that's going to knock our heads!
[00:35:27.168 --> 00:35:30.971]  Like, we're responsible for this!
[00:35:30.971 --> 00:35:35.795]  And they're saying, well we need regulators to stop the corrupt banks and brokerage firms after what they did.
[00:35:35.795 --> 00:35:40.078]  The Federal Reserve is the holding company for the very banks that did this!
[00:35:41.553 --> 00:35:45.076]  Give them authority to regulate themselves?
[00:35:45.076 --> 00:35:50.220]  I am so mad I feel like just smashing the microphone, smashing the studio and just leaving.
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:58.087]  I am sick of doing this and I'm sick of the cowardly public that's so stupid that they're allowing themselves to have their entire birthright stolen!
[00:36:02.564 --> 00:36:03.845]  I'm getting a pounding headache.
[00:36:03.845 --> 00:36:05.167]  This only happens every once in a while.
[00:36:05.167 --> 00:36:07.329]  And you know, sometimes I even end the show when this happens.
[00:36:07.329 --> 00:36:14.177]  I just go to rebroadcast because I am feeling extremely angry right now.
[00:36:14.177 --> 00:36:15.639]  And it's a rage I can't control.
[00:36:18.114 --> 00:36:18.634]  And you know what?
[00:36:18.634 --> 00:36:35.023]  You can call me a weirdo because I get angry about my entire future being destroyed, my children going into offshore banker slavery, the end of the Bill of Rights, the end of the Constitution, all these bills to ban the Second Amendment in Congress with the bastard media saying none of it exists.
[00:36:36.092 --> 00:36:39.574]  Youth brigades in red and black uniforms marching around.
[00:36:39.574 --> 00:36:43.776]  Homeland Security documents saying all protest is terrorism.
[00:36:43.776 --> 00:36:49.620]  All the army training manuals, public mainstream news say any protesting is terrorism.
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:51.120]  All gun owners are terrorists.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.701]  All veterans are terrorists.
[00:36:52.701 --> 00:36:53.222]  Bull!
[00:36:53.222 --> 00:36:53.642]  Bull!
[00:36:53.642 --> 00:36:54.662]  I almost said it.
[00:36:54.662 --> 00:36:55.443]  Bull!
[00:36:55.443 --> 00:36:59.465]  You are the terrorist!
[00:36:59.465 --> 00:37:02.607]  You people are illegitimate criminal filth!
[00:37:05.121 --> 00:37:15.845]  I can't blow up because I'll lose my energy and I have to work all night on a film I'm working on, so I just... Hold on.
[00:37:15.845 --> 00:37:16.546]  Okay, okay.
[00:37:16.546 --> 00:37:17.226]  I got control there.
[00:37:19.372 --> 00:37:20.953]  All right.
[00:37:20.953 --> 00:37:22.034]  Look at this.
[00:37:22.034 --> 00:37:25.716]  Stanford arrested by FBI outside girlfriend's home.
[00:37:25.716 --> 00:37:32.599]  You gotta love how they're arresting one of the mid-level little criminals that stole, you know, $8 to $20 billion, they're not sure.
[00:37:32.599 --> 00:37:36.642]  Like Madoff with $50 to $100 billion, the founder of the Nasdaq.
[00:37:36.642 --> 00:37:40.304]  One of the people that helped set up this whole system.
[00:37:40.304 --> 00:37:44.706]  And then, oh, he acted alone and his family gets to keep all the money.
[00:37:44.706 --> 00:37:45.847]  Sure, he swindled people.
[00:37:46.767 --> 00:37:48.308]  Over a hundred billion dollars.
[00:37:48.308 --> 00:37:50.450]  The media says fifty billion.
[00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:57.834]  Sure, he did all that by himself.
[00:37:57.834 --> 00:38:05.219]  Under investigation and alleged eight billion dollar fraud involving sales and certificates of deposits through the antitrust bank.
[00:38:05.219 --> 00:38:06.680]  See, they sell those deposits.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:07.961]  They leverage them.
[00:38:07.961 --> 00:38:10.003]  They fractional reserve them.
[00:38:10.003 --> 00:38:11.163]  Surrendered to federal agents.
[00:38:11.163 --> 00:38:11.924]  It was taken to
[00:38:15.708 --> 00:38:18.010]  Federal custody, his lawyer said.
[00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:30.598]  Stanford, 59, surrendered yesterday to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents who were waiting outside his girlfriend's house in Fredericksburg, Virginia, said Dick Degrinia, a lawyer for the Texas financier.
[00:38:30.598 --> 00:38:33.200]  Stanford is scheduled to appear today in the U.S.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.862]  District Court in Richmond, according to a government official.
[00:38:36.862 --> 00:38:41.866]  And they're going to burn a few mid-level criminals involved in all this, but Bernanke,
[00:38:43.103 --> 00:38:51.811]  And the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds, the ones running it all, Greenspan, nothing is going to happen to them.
[00:38:51.811 --> 00:38:55.215]  And that's why when Congress says, tell us where the trillions went,
[00:38:56.414 --> 00:38:58.876]  They say, I don't have to tell you and I'm not going to tell you.
[00:38:58.876 --> 00:39:00.937]  And they tell Senator Sanders that.
[00:39:00.937 --> 00:39:04.459]  And they tell Ron Paul that in the House and Senate Banking Committees.
[00:39:04.459 --> 00:39:06.581]  And they go on TV and say we're above the law.
[00:39:06.581 --> 00:39:08.702]  And by the way, we're not just above the law now.
[00:39:08.702 --> 00:39:12.265]  We're not just outside the law and can commit any crime we want.
[00:39:12.265 --> 00:39:20.730]  We now are going to have the Homeland Security and the Armed Department of Treasury and the FBI and everybody else under us with weapons.
[00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:23.032]  And we're going to come and take your businesses.
[00:39:23.032 --> 00:39:24.213]  You won't sell to us?
[00:39:25.503 --> 00:39:29.548]  Because, you know, we got all these tens of trillions we've stolen and created out of nothing.
[00:39:29.548 --> 00:39:38.818]  We're going to come make you sell to us, or in some cases they don't even make you sell, they just take it!
[00:39:38.818 --> 00:39:40.420]  That's why we've got to audit the Federal Reserve.
[00:39:41.431 --> 00:39:44.973]  We gotta get on the offensive against these people and discredit them and expose them.
[00:39:44.973 --> 00:39:55.018]  That's why they've hired thousands of professors and high school teachers to go out and do community service things where they pay for free food and drinks and have the public at hotel balls.
[00:39:55.018 --> 00:39:57.019]  They've had five or six I've seen in the news in Austin.
[00:39:57.827 --> 00:40:08.953]  Where they whine and dine and teach everybody the Federal Reserve is the answer to everything and basically offer the people jobs if they'll be little minion, little Soviet agents of the private Fed.
[00:40:08.953 --> 00:40:15.217]  They're just spawning private minions to go around enforcing on us.
[00:40:15.217 --> 00:40:16.698]  Usually they don't have to pay these people off.
[00:40:16.698 --> 00:40:25.383]  They just have local talk show hosted media people to a Federal Reserve banquet and buy them a T-bone steak and they'll sell their whole family out for a million years.
[00:40:28.797 --> 00:40:33.564]  There's a report here out of the Associated Press.
[00:40:33.564 --> 00:40:41.677]  Dodd giving the Fed more power is like awarding a son a bigger, faster car right after he crashed the family station wagon.
[00:40:43.561 --> 00:40:44.761]  That's Dodd playing politics.
[00:40:44.761 --> 00:40:56.664]  Remember when Obama tried to burn Dodd and said Dodd was the one that had given banker anonymity and allowed money from the stimulus package to go to banker bonuses?
[00:40:56.664 --> 00:40:57.804]  And Dodd went, what do you mean?
[00:40:57.804 --> 00:41:01.065]  You signed the executive order and told the Congress to add that in there.
[00:41:01.065 --> 00:41:01.725]  You wouldn't sign it.
[00:41:01.725 --> 00:41:04.726]  And the White House said, okay, you're right, and backed off.
[00:41:04.726 --> 00:41:09.967]  They were so arrogant, they were trying to blame it on their little low-level demon, Dodd.
[00:41:13.148 --> 00:41:20.010]  I have all these idiot Democrats sending me emails going, oh, Obama, he's fighting the banker bailout.
[00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:25.951]  No, Tim Geithner ran the private New York Fed, the real Fed, the one that runs all the others.
[00:41:25.951 --> 00:41:28.932]  One ring to rule them all and in the darkness bind them.
[00:41:28.932 --> 00:41:42.336]  He was the one, mainstream news admits, telling Bush and Paulson what to do, because he was the one at the Federal Reserve giving the money to Goldman Sachs, headed up by the Treasury Secretary.
[00:41:43.447 --> 00:41:51.390]  And now Geithner's on the news saying, you have got to give unlimited money and funding to the Federal Reserve.
[00:41:51.390 --> 00:42:01.213]  I advise you to give them unlimited power when that little bastard is a shareholder in the banks that own shares in the private Fed.
[00:42:01.213 --> 00:42:06.915]  When that little creature is the former Chief Executive Officer of the key Federal Reserve Bank.
[00:42:09.022 --> 00:42:10.742]  And I'll tell you what this dictatorship's doing.
[00:42:10.742 --> 00:42:16.524]  It's even shut down the other Fed governorships that local regional banks thought they were part of.
[00:42:16.524 --> 00:42:23.046]  They've all been bitching and complaining, even in Bloomberg, saying we've been completely shut off and this is a coup d'etat.
[00:42:23.046 --> 00:42:26.306]  In fact, remember two months ago, Bloomberg headline?
[00:42:26.306 --> 00:42:31.748]  Fed Governor Says Federal Reserve Involved in Takeover in Financial Coup.
[00:42:31.748 --> 00:42:36.449]  It is a coup d'etat by an offshore group of pirates!
[00:42:41.963 --> 00:42:42.923]  It is outrageous.
[00:42:42.923 --> 00:42:44.404]  It is just unbelievably outrageous.
[00:42:44.404 --> 00:42:52.288]  The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, quoted a critic of the plan to expand the Federal Reserve Powers in the Banking Committee hearing.
[00:42:52.288 --> 00:42:58.430]  He said, like awarding a son a bigger, faster car right after he crashed the family station wagon.
[00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:01.372]  He added that he hadn't made a conclusion on the issue.
[00:43:01.372 --> 00:43:05.674]  So see, he's acting like he's against it, but the bastard will vote for it.
[00:43:05.674 --> 00:43:06.774]  Watch.
[00:43:06.774 --> 00:43:08.495]  See, they'll act like they're against all this stuff.
[00:43:11.499 --> 00:43:14.161]  And then George Washington Blockspot says the critic is corrected.
[00:43:14.161 --> 00:43:17.243]  The Fed caused the Great Depression, according to Bernanke himself.
[00:43:17.243 --> 00:43:20.525]  The Fed largely caused the current financial crisis.
[00:43:20.525 --> 00:43:30.271]  The Fed creates new money out of thin air and then charges massive amounts in interest to the federal government, impoverishing the nation and stealing its wealth.
[00:43:30.271 --> 00:43:35.855]  And the Fed has refused to tell Congress and the American people where the trillions of dollars in bailout money are going.
[00:43:35.855 --> 00:43:36.975]  And then he has all the links.
[00:43:36.975 --> 00:43:38.416]  I love his writing.
[00:43:38.416 --> 00:43:39.277]  Everything's documented.
[00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:42.472]  So it's simple.
[00:43:42.472 --> 00:43:50.422]  Things are only going to get worse and worse and worse in the economy, and they're going to force you to serve them, work in their industries, in their police state system.
[00:43:50.422 --> 00:43:57.650]  They're converting us from manufacturing and jobs and farming to police state, and then they own the police state private grid.
[00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:58.111]  Period.
[00:44:06.121 --> 00:44:07.642]  That's coming up with Bob Chapman.
[00:44:07.642 --> 00:44:08.723]  Here's some of the other news.
[00:44:08.723 --> 00:44:14.247]  ACLU, Ron Paul's Campaign for Liberty, sue TSA over illegal detention.
[00:44:14.247 --> 00:44:16.629]  Remember the audio of him secretly recording it?
[00:44:16.629 --> 00:44:24.095]  Campaign for Liberty's having a huge event, selling t-shirts, Coca-Cola, you name it.
[00:44:24.095 --> 00:44:27.838]  They got 50,000 people coming into Kansas City to have an event.
[00:44:27.838 --> 00:44:31.261]  Their treasurer flies in with, what was it, $5,000.
[00:44:31.261 --> 00:44:32.822]  You'd have thought he had more.
[00:44:34.611 --> 00:44:45.893]  And in America, they search his bag, go into the checkpoint, find the cash, and they pull him aside, and they're about to steal the money under asset forfeiture seizure, like they do little old ladies here in Texas on the side of the highway every day.
[00:44:45.893 --> 00:44:47.614]  That's on the news.
[00:44:47.614 --> 00:44:49.754]  They said, you're going to answer our questions.
[00:44:49.754 --> 00:44:51.134]  He said, I'm not going to answer any of your questions.
[00:44:51.134 --> 00:44:54.415]  It's a free country!
[00:44:54.415 --> 00:44:56.195]  But meanwhile, I had Gary Franchi in here.
[00:44:56.195 --> 00:45:01.337]  He used to do loss prevention for a major retailer, and I've talked to so many others just like him.
[00:45:01.337 --> 00:45:03.377]  And they'd catch illegal aliens stealing stuff,
[00:45:04.551 --> 00:45:09.096]  At the department store, and they'd have fake IDs, and the cops would let them go.
[00:45:09.096 --> 00:45:18.986]  But if a 16-year-old, zit-faced teenage girl got caught stealing something, they had the book thrown at them, and they're never coming out of the prison system, basically.
[00:45:21.567 --> 00:45:22.928]  That's how America works!
[00:45:22.928 --> 00:45:25.670]  We are known as the idiot schmucks.
[00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:27.331]  We are known as the suckers.
[00:45:27.331 --> 00:45:28.872]  We are known as the fools.
[00:45:28.872 --> 00:45:36.218]  We are known as the people that will buy anything and will put up with anything because we think we're free!
[00:45:36.218 --> 00:45:39.700]  But no, I don't want to harass the precious little illegal aliens.
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:47.806]  I remember three years ago they were trying to pass the blanket amnesty plan and the Congress said, don't worry, we promise it's not an amnesty, but the bill is secret.
[00:45:49.377 --> 00:45:54.780]  But then Senator Sessions of Alabama leaked the bill and it was total complete amnesty for even felons.
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:46:00.223]  And they could bring their family members here, unlimited wide open borders.
[00:46:00.223 --> 00:46:02.324]  It would end illegal immigration because nothing would be illegal.
[00:46:03.166 --> 00:46:08.168]  I remember the AP article saying, oh yes, we're trying to do this to help the illegals in the tough economic times.
[00:46:08.168 --> 00:46:11.350]  They were still denying it was bad times for everybody else.
[00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:16.953]  And also, we're making sure that we give them loans even if it's not secured.
[00:46:16.953 --> 00:46:20.194]  We don't give this to citizens, but we want to help the immigrant communities.
[00:46:20.194 --> 00:46:26.918]  See, I told you about a lady I know, a good family friend, who ran one of the biggest apartment complexes.
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:28.420]  I think?
[00:46:45.694 --> 00:46:46.875]  Well, I've known since I was a little kid.
[00:46:46.875 --> 00:46:56.784]  The point is, I'm now hearing about the latest chapters in the saga, but going back five years ago, they have them up to the Christmas party in Dallas for all the managers.
[00:46:56.784 --> 00:47:00.067]  And they tell them, we've secretly been federalized.
[00:47:04.264 --> 00:47:17.184]  We have secretly been federalized and we don't have to pay income taxes anymore on any of our properties in a deal with Homeland Security, but we are to give illegal immigrants apartments.
[00:47:18.601 --> 00:47:22.702]  No matter how many they have in it, if it says two occupancy, they can have ten.
[00:47:22.702 --> 00:47:36.086]  But we want you to drive the citizens out, because we've got to convert to at least half of our occupants being on this new government housing program, part of infrastructure protection.
[00:47:36.086 --> 00:47:42.847]  And she's telling me all of this, and I already knew about it, but here it was directly, where they get to do whatever they want.
[00:47:42.847 --> 00:47:44.048]  You want a shoplift?
[00:47:44.048 --> 00:47:45.148]  You want a drunk drive?
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:47.761]  You want to not have insurance?
[00:47:47.761 --> 00:47:48.662]  Red carpet.
[00:47:48.662 --> 00:47:54.447]  They're passing laws all over the country where license plate reading cameras scan your license plate.
[00:47:54.447 --> 00:47:56.768]  They're already doing it, but it feeds into software.
[00:47:56.768 --> 00:48:10.159]  And the day your insurance is out, you're going to get arrested because you're a fat, stupid, slave, land of the cowards, home of the yellow bellies that'll put up with anything.
[00:48:10.159 --> 00:48:12.361]  But an illegal alien gets pulled over?
[00:48:12.361 --> 00:48:14.583]  Red carpets shoot out in front of them.
[00:48:15.782 --> 00:48:17.462]  You want houses and don't have credit?
[00:48:17.462 --> 00:48:18.923]  You got it.
[00:48:18.923 --> 00:48:22.324]  You want to be able to have ten people in a efficiency apartment?
[00:48:22.324 --> 00:48:23.884]  You got it.
[00:48:23.884 --> 00:48:25.265]  You want to be above the law?
[00:48:25.265 --> 00:48:26.205]  You got it.
[00:48:26.205 --> 00:48:27.485]  You want to be able to shoplift?
[00:48:27.485 --> 00:48:29.506]  You got it.
[00:48:29.506 --> 00:48:31.326]  Because this is a criminal government.
[00:48:31.326 --> 00:48:33.887]  At the top, the bankers can steal, loot, rob.
[00:48:33.887 --> 00:48:37.988]  They want the illegals here to drive down wages, to blow out their enemy, the middle class.
[00:48:37.988 --> 00:48:39.369]  This is military warfare.
[00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:42.153]  Pressure from below, pressure from above.
[00:48:42.153 --> 00:48:45.557]  Got the bankers and the IRS throwing everything they got at the American people.
[00:48:45.557 --> 00:48:52.687]  Meanwhile, billionaires cannot be audited because they don't even allow the IRS to audit them, don't even allow case officers at that level.
[00:48:52.687 --> 00:48:54.349]  That's mainstream news.
[00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:57.193]  Half of Congress AP reports doesn't even pay taxes.
[00:48:57.774 --> 00:49:15.118]  It's all just a sickening joke of criminals running around everywhere and they want the third world populations up here to blow out the wages and bankrupt America so nobody had a chance so everybody had to go into debt to the credit cards and so everybody would implode and so both the mother and father had to work so the kids
[00:49:17.981 --> 00:49:25.226]  would have to stay in school past three o'clock, four o'clock so the TV and the government could raise the kids so the parents wouldn't.
[00:49:25.226 --> 00:49:45.482]  And they've done a great job and they've devastated us and the public's a bunch of brain-dead animals who can't even hardly string a sentence together and everything's collapsing and falling apart and the new world order using high-tech psych warfare and economic warfare has devastated the nation and now they're rolling in with a completely engineered depression to bring in a hardcore tyranny and mop up the operation.
[00:49:48.951 --> 00:49:52.254]  And they're shifting the entire military over to Skynet.
[00:49:52.254 --> 00:49:59.119]  And that's not from the 1984 movie with the Terminator Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:49:59.119 --> 00:50:13.629]  The scriptwriters from that got all of that from Pentagon battle plans for Skynet, GroundNet, SmartNet, SmartDust, Skynet blimps, Skynet hovercrafts, Skynet drones.
[00:50:13.629 --> 00:50:15.431]  I went and saw the new Terminator movie because they're
[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:19.401]  Connected in with people making a Bilderberg group movie, so I wanted to see it.
[00:50:19.401 --> 00:50:21.221]  And it was all stuff that's already there.
[00:50:21.221 --> 00:50:23.782]  Twenty years ago they had those drones.
[00:50:23.782 --> 00:50:33.585]  The very drones that fly up and scan their faces to see if they need to be terminated are the very drones that I saw on Fox News five years ago they're going to deploy in America.
[00:50:33.585 --> 00:50:37.687]  We're going to be under Skynet, but controlled by humans!
[00:50:37.687 --> 00:50:42.268]  And they're going to carry out their extermination grid against the population of the planet.
[00:50:43.595 --> 00:50:44.736]  You think I'm joking around?
[00:50:44.736 --> 00:50:49.879]  It's all in the government documents, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:49.879 --> 00:50:53.081]  It's a sickening joke how they throw it in our face what they're gonna do to us.
[00:50:53.081 --> 00:51:00.966]  But they gotta bankrupt us first, get all the families broken up, controlled under government, and then the killing can start.
[00:51:00.966 --> 00:51:03.908]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:08.234]  Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:51:08.234 --> 00:51:11.958]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?

[00:52:07.674 --> 00:52:10.096]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[00:52:10.096 --> 00:52:17.443]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by calling
[00:52:18.544 --> 00:52:18.964]  I think so.
[00:52:37.894 --> 00:52:39.695]  I hope our listeners take advantage of this.

[00:52:53.223 --> 00:52:53.663]  The Bailout Group.
[00:53:02.159 --> 00:53:03.660]  Recognize that sound?
[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:08.444]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in pill form, that's exactly where many are ending up.
[00:53:08.444 --> 00:53:10.905]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[00:53:10.905 --> 00:53:16.229]  According to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[00:53:16.229 --> 00:53:21.633]  So for every $100 you spend on vitamins, that's $90 you're flushing down the toilet.
[00:53:21.633 --> 00:53:24.695]  In fact, orderlies at hospitals call these bedpan bullets.
[00:53:25.055 --> 00:53:27.496]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.

[00:54:25.306 --> 00:54:34.293]  Wall Street through Yale set up the OSS and then they set up the CIA in 1947.
[00:54:34.293 --> 00:54:36.955]  And they run all the insider trading, they run all the scams.
[00:54:36.955 --> 00:54:40.858]  It's all a bunch of made-off type individuals.
[00:54:40.858 --> 00:54:41.638]  It's all a bunch of
[00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:45.492]  R. Allen Stanford's.
[00:54:45.492 --> 00:54:51.937]  And here's Reuters, CIA seeks laid-off bankers in New York recruitment drive.
[00:54:51.937 --> 00:54:56.601]  And it says CIA bankers in America.
[00:54:56.601 --> 00:54:59.804]  That scumbag banker always trying to take your farm and ranch?
[00:54:59.804 --> 00:55:03.867]  He's in for guard, CIA ready to bust a cap right in your head.
[00:55:03.867 --> 00:55:08.130]  If you don't like that, they've hired the preachers to tell the stupid flocks to go along with this.
[00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:09.211]  Look, they mean business.
[00:55:09.211 --> 00:55:11.533]  This is a covert military operation.
[00:55:11.533 --> 00:55:12.254]  This is Reuters.
[00:55:13.717 --> 00:55:16.098]  Laid off from Wall Street, the CIA wants you.
[00:55:16.098 --> 00:55:17.959]  As long as you can pass a lie detector test.
[00:55:17.959 --> 00:55:19.840]  Ha ha, that's a funny.
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:24.402]  And show that you are motivated by service to your country rather than your wallet.
[00:55:24.402 --> 00:55:24.883]  Oh yeah.
[00:55:24.883 --> 00:55:27.124]  Oh yeah.
[00:55:27.124 --> 00:55:29.245]  That's exactly who they're looking for.
[00:55:29.245 --> 00:55:32.546]  They find out you're moral, they'll have you being a clerk.
[00:55:32.546 --> 00:55:39.250]  But they find out you're a hardcore criminal, a high-level operating psychopath, he'll be feasting on man flesh!
[00:55:40.455 --> 00:55:48.042]  The Central Intelligence Agency has been advertising for recruits and will be holding interviews on June 22nd at a secret location in New York.
[00:55:48.042 --> 00:55:56.589]  Yeah, they're expanding the size of the CIA with HUMET by at least four times, human intelligence, and they're turning them all loose on your streets.
[00:55:56.589 --> 00:55:57.350]  They admit it.
[00:55:57.350 --> 00:56:02.194]  They go, oh, we're setting up local CIA offices, liaisoning with the Pentagon in your city.
[00:56:02.194 --> 00:56:03.656]  We're fighting the evil gun owners.
[00:56:05.199 --> 00:56:08.200]  By the way, protesting's illegal and we're getting rid of juries.
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:09.320]  We're the good guys.
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:11.101]  We're the foreign bankers.
[00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:12.782]  What, you don't love America?
[00:56:12.782 --> 00:56:15.783]  We may have to waterboard you!
[00:56:15.783 --> 00:56:24.406]  Economics, finance, and business professionals, in the quest for the bottom line, is just not enough for you.
[00:56:24.406 --> 00:56:26.967]  That's right, you want to torture people.
[00:56:26.967 --> 00:56:28.807]  They won't hand over their company.
[00:56:28.807 --> 00:56:33.529]  Economics, finance, and business professionals, in the quest for the bottom line, is not enough for you.
[00:56:34.505 --> 00:56:38.348]  The Central Intelligence Agency has a mission like no other.
[00:56:38.348 --> 00:56:47.734]  One radio advertiser for the agency says, Join the CIA's Directorate of Intelligence and be part of the global mission as an economic or financial analyst.
[00:56:47.734 --> 00:56:51.717]  Make a difference in your career and for your nation, it says.
[00:56:51.717 --> 00:56:54.980]  Analyze what companies might keep America afloat.
[00:56:54.980 --> 00:57:00.824]  Give us the information and we'll send in regulators to shut them down and hand it over to the corporate borg offshore.
[00:57:03.061 --> 00:57:06.446]  That would be the real recruiting ad.
[00:57:06.446 --> 00:57:08.830]  Help analyze banks not under our control.
[00:57:08.830 --> 00:57:12.134]  They're laundering money from cocaine and heroin sales.
[00:57:12.134 --> 00:57:15.839]  We'll go in and take them over and jack up the heroin price.
[00:57:17.247 --> 00:57:18.407]  We're the CIA.
[00:57:18.407 --> 00:57:23.790]  We've increased the opium coming out of Afghanistan since we liberated it eightfold.
[00:57:23.790 --> 00:57:25.630]  We'll turn your daughters into junkies.
[00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:29.192]  The new American pastime is your daughters to be prostitutes.
[00:57:29.192 --> 00:57:30.172]  We're the CIA.
[00:57:30.172 --> 00:57:33.313]  We run giant child kidnapping rings that even come out in Congress.
[00:57:33.313 --> 00:57:34.854]  Nothing can stop us.
[00:57:34.854 --> 00:57:37.935]  We've got a nation of cattle slaves who we can feed off of.
[00:57:37.935 --> 00:57:38.856]  Join us.
[00:57:38.856 --> 00:57:41.517]  This is the final takeover and destruction of America.
[00:57:41.517 --> 00:57:42.157]  Ha ha ha!
[00:57:44.522 --> 00:57:57.110]  Ron Patrick, a spokesman for recruitment and retention at the CIA, told Reuters Television the agency had received several hundred resumes so far from applicants ranging from people just out of graduate school to laid-off bankers.
[00:57:57.110 --> 00:57:58.571]  Notice that deceptive ad.
[00:57:58.571 --> 00:58:04.275]  Folks, they're running ads on every Austin radio station I listen to 24-7, almost every break.
[00:58:04.275 --> 00:58:06.196]  You think they've gotten a few hundred applicants?
[00:58:06.196 --> 00:58:07.477]  More of it is disinfo.
[00:58:07.477 --> 00:58:08.798]  That's how they throw out disinfo.
[00:58:08.798 --> 00:58:09.999]  All they do is lie.
[00:58:09.999 --> 00:58:13.241]  They don't want you to know about the army of PSYOP, SCSI.
[00:58:13.241 --> 00:58:14.002]  They're breeding.
[00:58:14.602 --> 00:58:19.525]  That'll be commanding the youth brigades with the submachine guns.
[00:58:19.525 --> 00:58:22.087]  Oh, you think I'm joking?
[00:58:22.087 --> 00:58:23.448]  I'm not joking about any of this.
[00:58:23.448 --> 00:58:29.792]  I got Bob Chapman coming up in T-minus 60 seconds.
[00:58:29.792 --> 00:58:30.532]  I'm Alex Jones.

[01:00:17.229 --> 01:00:21.273]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.892 --> 01:00:33.413]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:00:33.413 --> 01:00:39.477]  We're now into the second hour of this Friday edition, the 19th day of June 2009.
[01:00:39.477 --> 01:00:47.382]  Bob Chapman with us for the next hour, and we've got several guests in studio dealing with the fluoridation of the water supply.
[01:00:47.382 --> 01:00:48.723]  Fluoride's a catch-all term.
[01:00:48.723 --> 01:00:53.567]  Sodium fluoride is bad enough for you, but we're going to break down what is really being put
[01:00:54.620 --> 01:01:00.782]  in the water supply today and the successful fight against fluoridation going on around the planet.
[01:01:00.782 --> 01:01:05.643]  There is hope, ladies and gentlemen, so key information coming up there.
[01:01:05.643 --> 01:01:20.927]  I've been ranting and raving the last three days because they've now unveiled, and it's worse than I first thought it would be, I knew the banks had gotten unlimited power to loot and steal, but now it says to seize any corporation, any company, take over the nation, that they're implementing the executive orders
[01:01:21.914 --> 01:01:22.295]  I don't know.
[01:01:35.615 --> 01:01:42.340]  He has now come out and pointed out that the Federal Reserve is to get more power than even Congress under this new system.
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:02:00.613]  So they engineer the crisis, get unlimited money, now they want the power to seize not just GM and Ford and Chrysler, but factories, restaurants, businesses, dealerships, and then they admit that the Democratic Party mainly keeps the dealerships they want and sells the others and gives them to friends.
[01:02:00.613 --> 01:02:01.533]  I mean, this is
[01:02:02.694 --> 01:02:10.817]  Happening faster than I even thought it could Bob Chapman of course was in Military intelligence in Berlin we got out of the military.
[01:02:10.817 --> 01:02:15.279]  He became the biggest gold and silver broker Individual silver broker out there.
[01:02:15.279 --> 01:02:17.880]  He had one of the largest newsletters and he retired he came back.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:23.662]  It's the international forecaster He's been a guest on international TV and radio literally thousands of times.
[01:02:23.662 --> 01:02:25.302]  He joins us each Friday Bob
[01:02:26.963 --> 01:02:29.745]  This is getting even crazier quicker than I thought.
[01:02:29.745 --> 01:02:35.930]  Can you break down what this new quote regulatory overhaul is?
[01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:48.219]  Well, I think what they want to do here is be able to control all forms of financial machinations, if you may.
[01:02:48.219 --> 01:02:51.982]  Anything that has to do with money.
[01:02:51.982 --> 01:02:56.405]  And what I think they're going to do is, if they can get away with it,
[01:02:57.057 --> 01:02:59.998]  And there's a lot of resistance in Congress.
[01:02:59.998 --> 01:03:14.500]  And that's borne out by the numbers I received yesterday on HR 1207, which is Ron Paul's bill to audit the Federal Reserve.
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:19.441]  I understand it's 258 co-sponsors.
[01:03:19.441 --> 01:03:24.482]  And that means that there's a lot of people in Congress, even though
[01:03:25.225 --> 01:03:34.368]  Five or ten percent of their campaign contributions come from Wall Street banking, insurance, etc.
[01:03:34.368 --> 01:03:44.771]  I think they're under so much pressure from the public, not only their constituents, but others who are writing them, that this is a phenomenal amount of co-sponsors.
[01:03:44.771 --> 01:03:52.893]  So I do not think they're going to get through this proposed rule changes so that
[01:03:53.854 --> 01:04:00.936]  The Federal Reserve can become a monster money czar, if you want to call it that.
[01:04:00.936 --> 01:04:03.397]  They like that word czar very much.
[01:04:03.397 --> 01:04:07.039]  I think they've created about 14 or 15 of them.
[01:04:07.039 --> 01:04:19.903]  Anyway, I also want to refer here to your report on Prison Planet, Obama Regulatory Reform Plan Officially Establishes Banking Dictatorship in the United States.
[01:04:19.903 --> 01:04:21.323]  And it's really terrific.
[01:04:21.323 --> 01:04:22.704]  It's kind of like an outline.
[01:04:23.402 --> 01:04:27.450]  And for those of you who haven't seen it, please go and take a look at it.
[01:04:27.450 --> 01:04:30.898]  It's a date of June 18th, which was yesterday.
[01:04:32.776 --> 01:04:35.857]  Well, Bob, break down why, from your perspective, why it's so important.
[01:04:35.857 --> 01:04:39.798]  And also, you were in intelligence in Berlin.
[01:04:39.798 --> 01:04:53.521]  They're now admitting the CIA is hiring domestic bankers to go out and help set up this financial dictatorship, because if they can control the economy and the money, they're going to control everything, and this is their tool to bring in their New World Order.
[01:04:53.521 --> 01:04:58.582]  So I want to break that down and how we defeat it, how we fight back against it, with Bob Chapman on the other side of this quick break.
[01:05:00.711 --> 01:05:05.914]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:05:05.914 --> 01:05:09.937]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.937 --> 01:05:15.840]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:20.904]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.904 --> 01:05:21.404]  Number three,
[01:05:21.824 --> 01:05:28.108]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:05:28.108 --> 01:05:31.010]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:35.533]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:35.533 --> 01:05:39.135]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:05:39.375 --> 01:05:45.102]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:05:45.102 --> 01:05:49.807]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:49.807 --> 01:05:51.589]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:54.152]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[01:05:54.152 --> 01:05:56.795]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[01:06:00.259 --> 01:06:01.640]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:03.641]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:06:03.641 --> 01:06:04.622]  Well, you should.
[01:06:04.622 --> 01:06:09.104]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:06:09.104 --> 01:06:09.925]  That's right.
[01:06:09.925 --> 01:06:19.930]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:21.071]  Plus, if you act fast,
[01:06:21.291 --> 01:06:27.253]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XV pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:06:27.253 --> 01:06:34.154]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:06:34.154 --> 01:06:39.676]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[01:06:39.676 --> 01:06:41.136]  This is real.
[01:06:41.136 --> 01:06:42.196]  Don't miss out.
[01:06:42.196 --> 01:06:44.717]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course.
[01:06:45.017 --> 01:06:50.740]  Plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.

[01:07:01.072 --> 01:07:04.075]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:07:04.075 --> 01:07:09.420]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:11.462]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:07:11.462 --> 01:07:16.067]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:07:18.268 --> 01:07:19.089]  We're good.
[01:07:36.121 --> 01:07:36.601]  Thanks for watching.
[01:08:00.945 --> 01:08:06.348]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.348 --> 01:08:08.630]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:19.170 --> 01:08:20.572]  I want to open the phones up.
[01:08:20.572 --> 01:08:27.119]  Financial questions only for Bob Chapman.
[01:08:27.119 --> 01:08:30.182]  There's a million of those to ask.
[01:08:30.182 --> 01:08:30.823]  1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231
[01:08:34.249 --> 01:08:37.731]  Bob Shetland is our guest right now.
[01:08:37.731 --> 01:08:38.991]  Going back to Bob.
[01:08:38.991 --> 01:08:47.956]  Bob, for stations that just joined us, we were going over Obama regulatory reform plan officially establishes banking dictatorship in the United States.
[01:08:47.956 --> 01:08:56.520]  In a few minutes, I'm going to play a short Ron Paul clip where he says, yes, the banks will have more authority under this than Congress.
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:09:02.523]  And the way the bill reads, even the LA Times admitted that it gives them power over anything connected to the economy,
[01:09:03.203 --> 01:09:18.452]  Any market, any company, from a hot dog stand, to a bank, to an insurance company, and you were getting into our article from PrisonPlanet.com, Obama regulatory reform plan officially establishes banking dictatorship in the United States.
[01:09:18.452 --> 01:09:29.739]  Is it that it's so big and so over-the-top, people have trouble realizing the magnitude of the very banks that engineered the crisis, that have stolen tens of trillions, they now
[01:09:31.021 --> 01:09:38.987]  Not only won't tell us where the money went, but they are going to be the regulators of themselves and over the rest of Main Street.
[01:09:38.987 --> 01:09:42.690]  They've already devastated.
[01:09:42.690 --> 01:09:44.611]  This is a form of dictatorship.
[01:09:44.611 --> 01:09:46.333]  There's no question.
[01:09:46.333 --> 01:09:55.119]  The important things are that there is no control whatsoever by Congress, which you've mentioned, and it is a private corporation.
[01:09:55.119 --> 01:09:58.262]  They refuse to answer government subpoenas.
[01:09:58.851 --> 01:10:03.554]  They say that it's state secret when asked about what they're doing.
[01:10:03.554 --> 01:10:06.616]  And that's why Ron Paul's bill is so important.
[01:10:06.616 --> 01:10:11.679]  We can cut this whole thing off at the pass if that bill is passed.
[01:10:11.679 --> 01:10:17.643]  And it certainly stands a great chance in the House of Passing.
[01:10:17.643 --> 01:10:27.790]  One of the things that I thought of in regard to this, which sort of meshes what you were talking about earlier about the hiring of people
[01:10:28.726 --> 01:10:54.837]  For the CIA to go into economic and financial matters, I think that at this time, the Treasury Department in conjunction with the Fed and the people who control our government from behind the scenes, they are making this move in behalf of the Fed now as an offense
[01:10:56.383 --> 01:11:00.326]  In a defensive manner because of what's going on in Congress.
[01:11:00.326 --> 01:11:09.613]  What they want to say is, well we want the Fed to be able to handle these things and you want to audit it or shut it down.
[01:11:10.017 --> 01:11:13.059]  And we can't have that because it's so crucial.
[01:11:13.059 --> 01:11:14.499]  This is what they're up to here.
[01:11:14.499 --> 01:11:15.700]  I was about to ask you that.
[01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:22.043]  This looks like kind of a fleeing forward or asking for the moon because they're under attack.
[01:11:22.043 --> 01:11:23.784]  People are saying we're going to audit you.
[01:11:23.784 --> 01:11:25.465]  There's subpoenas from Congress.
[01:11:25.465 --> 01:11:27.927]  They're refusing those subpoenas from Congress.
[01:11:27.927 --> 01:11:30.608]  So really this constitutional crisis is forming.
[01:11:30.608 --> 01:11:31.989]  There shouldn't be a crisis.
[01:11:31.989 --> 01:11:34.230]  This isn't the president refusing subpoenas.
[01:11:34.230 --> 01:11:35.931]  This is a private offshore bank
[01:11:36.471 --> 01:11:36.631]  That's
[01:11:53.755 --> 01:12:08.652]  Mr. Perkins, who wrote Confessions of an Economic Hitman, and I've actually interviewed him now for the next Obama film coming out, John Perkins, and Mr. Perkins was hired by the NSA and the CIA, top of his class, family and all these big corporations.
[01:12:08.652 --> 01:12:12.396]  He was sent in, he would be given orders by army generals.
[01:12:13.177 --> 01:12:13.737]  That's exactly right.
[01:12:13.737 --> 01:12:14.098]  Exactly right.
[01:12:14.098 --> 01:12:16.259]  And that's what all of that recruiting is all about.
[01:12:16.259 --> 01:12:18.140]  They want to use these people against us.
[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:19.421]  One of the things that's behind this
[01:12:42.731 --> 01:12:58.454]  And incidentally, to just go a little bit further on their recruiting, but further than that, is what they're up to here is this is pure psychological warfare.
[01:12:58.454 --> 01:13:00.215]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:13:00.215 --> 01:13:04.175]  They know that the House is going to vote for this bill.
[01:13:04.175 --> 01:13:09.116]  I don't know what the Senate will do, but I assume perhaps they will as well.
[01:13:09.116 --> 01:13:12.497]  And in order to cut that off, what they're trying to do is say,
[01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:19.092]  We can't allow the Fed to be audited or tampered with in any way.
[01:13:19.537 --> 01:13:22.479]  Because it's too important, and so on and so forth.
[01:13:22.479 --> 01:13:24.800]  This is the CyWar aspects of it.
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.722]  Yeah, we're in the middle of a crisis.
[01:13:27.722 --> 01:13:31.105]  If you audit the Fed, they're already saying this, it's going to cause a depression.
[01:13:31.105 --> 01:13:34.967]  They've hired this big lobbying firm, and we now see their branding.
[01:13:34.967 --> 01:13:38.449]  If you audit us, it'll destroy confidence, and we'll have a depression.
[01:13:38.449 --> 01:13:40.311]  And we're going into a depression.
[01:13:40.311 --> 01:13:46.475]  That way, even if we get the audit, they'll blame us for the depression they engineered.
[01:13:46.475 --> 01:13:47.295]  That's correct.
[01:13:47.295 --> 01:13:48.276]  And, of course,
[01:13:48.931 --> 01:13:55.936]  Anybody who has any financial background whatsoever looks at this thing and says, I mean, these are the guys that caused this thing.
[01:13:55.936 --> 01:13:59.759]  How can we allow them to take us out of it?
[01:13:59.759 --> 01:14:02.521]  And which is ridiculous.
[01:14:02.521 --> 01:14:09.686]  But anyway, the recruiting is for to do exactly as you said, but it goes one step further.
[01:14:09.686 --> 01:14:16.311]  The concept behind the thought patent of the elitist is that all the money in America,
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:20.561]  All the wealth in the world, for that matter, belongs to them.
[01:14:20.561 --> 01:14:25.163]  It does not belong to you.
[01:14:25.163 --> 01:14:28.044]  You have it on a temporary basis.
[01:14:28.044 --> 01:14:46.131]  And so consequently, I think that what they're going to do eventually, and other countries will follow, they will probably set up currency controls of some kind, not right away, in the future, maybe two or three years down the line, when inflation is going bonkers again.
[01:14:46.974 --> 01:14:50.575]  But these are some of the things that... Well, that's what they're announcing.
[01:14:50.575 --> 01:14:53.696]  They're saying in Australia they're going to make people go to chips.
[01:14:53.696 --> 01:14:54.897]  No more cash.
[01:14:54.897 --> 01:15:01.719]  Even if you use cash here, it's going to be tied to a thumbprint or a face print to quote stop the underground economy.
[01:15:01.719 --> 01:15:08.742]  And this really is a worldwide financial dictatorship run by intelligence agents.
[01:15:08.742 --> 01:15:12.403]  Bob, back when you were in intelligence, before you got into finance,
[01:15:13.403 --> 01:15:17.026]  Uh, you know, they told you guys you were doing what you were doing, fighting the dirty commies.
[01:15:17.026 --> 01:15:18.868]  And, you know, there was some truth to that.
[01:15:18.868 --> 01:15:25.754]  But now, how are they going to recruit these bankers and people to go around butchering America and forcibly taking over corporations?
[01:15:25.754 --> 01:15:35.141]  I mean, they're saying the Fed is going to go in and reorganize the economy and grab whatever industries they want, where basically only select
[01:15:36.202 --> 01:15:39.985]  Well, usually, unfortunately, they draw some of the best people.
[01:15:39.985 --> 01:15:45.808]  And my experience with the people that I was involved with, they were all extraordinarily bright.
[01:16:05.983 --> 01:16:10.265]  But at that time, we didn't have the things going on that we have today.
[01:16:10.265 --> 01:16:17.467]  And today, there are not jobs out there for people who are sometimes double and triple degreed.
[01:16:17.467 --> 01:16:28.731]  And so out of the fact that they can't get a job anywhere that's decent, if the CIA offers them a good position, they're going to take it.
[01:16:28.731 --> 01:16:31.412]  Because they're going to say, if I don't take it, I'm not going to eat.
[01:16:32.833 --> 01:16:39.795]  And so they take our tax money and then hire economic goons to literally go around and blow out what's left of U.S.
[01:16:39.795 --> 01:16:43.256]  companies so they can be looted off to the internationalists.
[01:16:43.256 --> 01:16:45.417]  I mean, that's what's happening, Bob.
[01:16:45.417 --> 01:16:46.037]  That's right.
[01:16:46.037 --> 01:16:51.339]  And the police in America, with this federalization, are in the same bag.
[01:16:51.339 --> 01:16:56.140]  I mean, hey, they quit their job and become part of the program.
[01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:57.861]  This is how they capture people.
[01:16:58.792 --> 01:17:02.116]  And, you know, unless you want to leave your job, there's no way out.
[01:17:02.116 --> 01:17:06.923]  You've got to stay and do the dirty work of the bad guys.
[01:17:06.923 --> 01:17:09.045]  My God, Bob.
[01:17:09.045 --> 01:17:13.651]  They're announcing unemployment numbers exploding, housing prices plunging even faster.
[01:17:15.558 --> 01:17:15.918]  I didn't either.
[01:17:44.837 --> 01:17:52.179]  I was really shocked that they went this way, in this offensive way, as a defense.
[01:17:52.179 --> 01:17:57.320]  But, you know, in psychological warfare, this is the kind of thing that you do.
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:00.160]  And what they're asking for is U.S.
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:03.781]  and then probably world financial domination.
[01:18:03.781 --> 01:18:05.961]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:18:05.961 --> 01:18:09.262]  And, you know, you talk about these offshore accounts.
[01:18:09.262 --> 01:18:10.662]  The U.S.
[01:18:10.662 --> 01:18:14.263]  Treasury has had, as well as the Fed, do have
[01:18:14.759 --> 01:18:27.853]  Secret offshore accounts and they go through the American system like in the bond market and they will buy bonds and we can't tell that they're doing that because we can't investigate them.
[01:18:27.853 --> 01:18:33.458]  If this bill pass we can we can find out what they're doing and then you run into money laundering.
[01:18:33.458 --> 01:18:34.720]  There's all sorts of
[01:18:35.936 --> 01:18:39.138]  Of real horrible things are going to be exposed.
[01:18:39.138 --> 01:18:46.261]  You think we'd find something a thousand times, a hundred times worse than Madoff and others if we ever audited the Fed, Bob?
[01:18:46.261 --> 01:18:47.442]  Absolutely.
[01:18:47.442 --> 01:18:57.786]  And incidentally, now that you bring up Mr. Madoff, and that's sort of, that was a scam, not a Ponzi scheme.
[01:18:57.786 --> 01:19:05.090]  I have to refer to Mr. Greenberg, who was the head of AIG, and he testified yesterday.
[01:19:05.954 --> 01:19:26.246]  And when he essentially stole the stock in the company and put it into star investments from AIG, he hired a jet with guards and they took the certificates of AIG stock and put them in offshore accounts.
[01:19:26.246 --> 01:19:30.188]  Now, you hear about these offshore accounts and you hear about the U.S.
[01:19:30.188 --> 01:19:34.411]  government running all over the place trying to find out who's got them.
[01:19:34.983 --> 01:19:39.024]  And they don't touch top members of the Illuminati.
[01:19:39.024 --> 01:19:39.424]  That's right.
[01:19:39.424 --> 01:19:45.005]  You got the big kingpins, and they'll fry a few mid-level ones to pacify the public.
[01:19:45.005 --> 01:19:50.267]  Well, meanwhile, they're testifying in Congress that they're stealing everything blind right in front of everybody.
[01:19:50.267 --> 01:19:55.828]  That's like the Pentagon when they said, you got two trillion missing, and they said, yeah, I'm not going to tell you where it is.
[01:19:55.828 --> 01:19:57.728]  We got the Predator drones, people.
[01:19:57.728 --> 01:19:59.669]  We'll take over.
[01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.969]  Yeah.
[01:20:01.212 --> 01:20:06.536]  You've probably heard about the incredible, powerful, and natural antioxidants found in red wine.
[01:20:06.536 --> 01:20:11.019]  Unfortunately, not everyone is able to drink a glass of wine each day.
[01:20:11.019 --> 01:20:15.443]  Now, you don't have to drink even a single drop, thanks to NuRev.
[01:20:15.443 --> 01:20:21.367]  NuRev is America's number one anti-aging supplement, thanks to its active ingredient resveratrol.

[01:21:02.674 --> 01:21:05.997]  A new world order in the near future.
[01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:10.352]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:21:10.352 --> 01:21:13.193]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[01:21:13.193 --> 01:21:15.954]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:21:15.954 --> 01:21:19.156]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:21:19.156 --> 01:21:26.460]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:21:29.505 --> 01:21:34.929]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:21:34.929 --> 01:21:38.251]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:21:38.251 --> 01:21:41.373]  The Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:21:41.373 --> 01:21:42.554]  Most people have no idea.
[01:21:42.554 --> 01:21:43.334]  They're not after money.
[01:21:43.334 --> 01:21:44.615]  They have all the money they need.
[01:21:44.615 --> 01:21:45.596]  They're after power.
[01:21:45.596 --> 01:21:46.737]  That's what they're after these days.

[01:21:58.284 --> 01:21:59.325]  You have been warned.
[01:22:02.007 --> 01:22:03.447]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:03.447 --> 01:22:09.511]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:22:09.511 --> 01:22:10.332]  That's right.
[01:22:10.332 --> 01:22:13.173]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:22:13.173 --> 01:22:20.098]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:22:20.658 --> 01:22:28.781]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:28.781 --> 01:22:34.262]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:22:34.262 --> 01:22:37.283]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:40.064 --> 01:22:44.590]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.

[01:24:22.671 --> 01:24:40.222]  Bob Chapman, I'm sure you saw the ACLU letter and even mainstream news outlets reporting the incredible headline, All Protest Terrorism.
[01:24:41.055 --> 01:24:56.780]  And another headline, all acts of protest, low-level terrorism, all of the army soldiers are now being taught as part of their security training that protesting is illegal and anti-government, anti-American.
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:57.820]  You dovetail that
[01:24:59.226 --> 01:25:06.028]  With a DHS report saying veterans are terrorists, gun owners are terrorists, people with third-party bumper stickers are terrorists.
[01:25:06.028 --> 01:25:11.790]  I mean, this is so outrageously un-American and tyrannical.
[01:25:11.790 --> 01:25:16.312]  It's so patently obvious that the people teaching this are the terrorists.
[01:25:16.992 --> 01:25:19.933]  I mean, this is right out of the Soviet Union, right out of Nazi Germany.
[01:25:19.933 --> 01:25:21.433]  Where do you see this going?
[01:25:21.433 --> 01:25:37.078]  Or, like you said, with the PSYOP, are they just trying to be so incredibly off the chart, obvious with their tyranny, that they think people are just going to accept it and go, yes, protesting is illegal, never allowed in America.
[01:25:37.078 --> 01:25:44.360]  Well, I think that that's what their intention is, and whether they're going to be successful or not remains to be seen.
[01:25:45.739 --> 01:25:49.241]  Our armed forces personnel are not stupid.
[01:25:49.241 --> 01:25:53.502]  And they're going to say to themselves, no, this isn't right.
[01:25:53.502 --> 01:25:56.163]  And 90% of them will think that way.
[01:25:56.163 --> 01:26:10.809]  And so they may be making noises to condition people, particularly in the military and people who hear about it, about anybody who disagrees as a terrorist.
[01:26:10.809 --> 01:26:14.010]  It's not going to be bought, but it'll scare some people, there's no question.
[01:26:14.773 --> 01:26:20.195]  I mean, you have, again, almost half the people in America are functionally illiterate.
[01:26:20.195 --> 01:26:23.536]  And they'll, unfortunately, believe everything.
[01:26:23.536 --> 01:26:24.816]  Well, Bob, I think you just hit it.
[01:26:24.816 --> 01:26:27.637]  This is meant to be, obviously, tyranny.
[01:26:27.637 --> 01:26:32.038]  And it's meant to make all the thinking people go, whoa, we really do have a tyranny.
[01:26:32.038 --> 01:26:32.999]  I better shut up.
[01:26:32.999 --> 01:26:36.040]  It's meant to be a bullying, chilling effect.
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:43.102]  And if we shut up and let them bully us, then the real corruption and oppression comes in.
[01:26:44.454 --> 01:26:48.157]  No, I think you're absolutely right, and that's a good take on it.
[01:26:48.157 --> 01:26:53.682]  But underlying the whole thing, you can see the direction that they're going in.
[01:26:53.682 --> 01:26:57.205]  And that direction is toward total government.
[01:26:57.205 --> 01:27:03.891]  And, you know, every day we come up with another facet of what they're trying to do.
[01:27:03.891 --> 01:27:09.716]  And you can imagine the many, many people that they have planning these things.
[01:27:09.716 --> 01:27:12.318]  I wouldn't doubt it that they had hundreds of thousands of people
[01:27:12.762 --> 01:27:20.784]  Coming up with these ideas every day via the foundations and think tanks and within governments.
[01:27:20.784 --> 01:27:23.864]  And don't forget the governments all connect with each other.
[01:27:23.864 --> 01:27:27.825]  They all see each other, the Bilderberg meetings.
[01:27:27.825 --> 01:27:31.066]  And so they're all linked together.
[01:27:31.066 --> 01:27:41.928]  And so something, an idea comes out of a think tank in Germany and it's spread throughout all of the other luminous conclaves and it becomes
[01:27:42.429 --> 01:27:43.249]  A project.
[01:27:43.249 --> 01:27:45.471]  And that's where they get these things from.
[01:27:45.471 --> 01:27:54.335]  And, you know, the public has got to understand they have an endless amount of money and they work 24 hours a day at this.
[01:27:54.335 --> 01:28:03.860]  And, you know, you and I and people like us have a mountainous job trying to get the word to the public of what they're doing and why they're doing it.
[01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:08.002]  And in this case, why they're doing it, again, is conditioning.
[01:28:08.002 --> 01:28:11.524]  They want you to think that anybody who
[01:28:12.105 --> 01:28:16.791]  Says anything, criticizes government in any way, is a terrorist.
[01:28:18.678 --> 01:28:20.440]  Unbelievable.
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.021]  Bob, I've been throwing out my questions.
[01:28:22.021 --> 01:28:36.835]  We're about to break and come back and go to calls, but so much is happening in the economy, and you're a guy, for those who don't know who you are out there, a lot of new stations who have just made hundreds and hundreds of accurate forecasts and predictions about the economy with stunning accuracy.
[01:28:36.835 --> 01:28:39.217]  What is most important right now in the economy?
[01:28:39.217 --> 01:28:43.762]  What's some of the other news that people should know about, about the direction of the economy and where it's going?
[01:28:45.029 --> 01:28:50.593]  Well, I think coming up in July, they're going to have a second quarter earnings, and they're not going to be very good.
[01:28:50.593 --> 01:28:55.837]  And I think that before the month is over, that the stock market will start down.
[01:28:55.837 --> 01:29:01.522]  And whether it'll go down to 6,600 at this time during the summer remains to be seen.
[01:29:01.522 --> 01:29:08.387]  But I think there's a good shot that we could go back to 6,600 on the Dow in the fall and test it.
[01:29:08.387 --> 01:29:14.792]  At the same time, I see that every time gold sticks its head up, they try to knock it down.
[01:29:15.282 --> 01:29:18.358]  But the physical market keeps on coming through.
[01:29:18.358 --> 01:29:19.785]  And as long as that continues,
[01:29:20.253 --> 01:29:23.235]  Goal will remain relatively strong.
[01:29:23.235 --> 01:29:25.856]  All right, let's get more into that after the quick break.

[01:30:00.757 --> 01:30:02.458]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:02.458 --> 01:30:07.200]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:10.162]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:30:10.162 --> 01:30:13.203]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:30:13.203 --> 01:30:17.926]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:30:18.086 --> 01:30:18.386]  We're good.

[01:32:00.725 --> 01:32:05.246]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California, who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[01:32:05.246 --> 01:32:07.806]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[01:32:07.806 --> 01:32:17.468]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[01:32:17.468 --> 01:32:23.669]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:26.369]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[01:32:26.369 --> 01:32:28.750]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:30.110]  We're good.
[01:32:52.609 --> 01:32:54.072]  OwnMyself.com.
[01:32:54.072 --> 01:32:57.858]  It takes very little money, and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[01:32:57.858 --> 01:33:00.343]  Remember, Chocolate.OwnMyself.com.
[01:33:28.357 --> 01:33:39.328]  Bob Chapman, you got cut off by the break there, getting into where you see gold going.
[01:33:41.192 --> 01:33:46.476]  You did predict the last three ups and downs of the stock market with amazing accuracy.
[01:33:46.476 --> 01:33:48.897]  You've done a great job predicting gold.
[01:33:48.897 --> 01:33:51.319]  You said you thought it would go up to $9.60.
[01:33:51.319 --> 01:33:53.020]  It did and passed that.
[01:33:53.020 --> 01:34:00.205]  You said they'd probably push it back down a few more times throughout the summer, but you and many others are predicting it's going to go way up.
[01:34:00.205 --> 01:34:01.306]  What, into the fall?
[01:34:01.306 --> 01:34:01.566]  Winter?
[01:34:04.008 --> 01:34:18.618]  Well, I think we have a good shot at going through a thousand before the year is out.
[01:34:18.618 --> 01:34:25.983]  And if I had to pick a time, I would say October would be a good one, or in December for that matter.
[01:34:25.983 --> 01:34:32.548]  And so that's the way I think it's going to go, in spite of the inner workings and manipulation
[01:34:33.366 --> 01:34:44.452]  Of the Working Group on Financial Markets, which is a legal entity within government that does, 24 hours a day, manipulate all markets.
[01:34:44.452 --> 01:34:50.975]  And that's another thing that will be exposed in the audit of the Federal Reserve.
[01:34:50.975 --> 01:34:52.676]  Just what they're doing in these markets.
[01:34:52.676 --> 01:34:56.798]  I mean, this legislation is going to be devastating.
[01:34:56.798 --> 01:35:01.020]  It's got to pass because we can cut them off at the pass.
[01:35:02.129 --> 01:35:05.895]  It is, you just have no idea how important it is.
[01:35:05.895 --> 01:35:10.422]  I call it the most important legislation in the last hundred years.
[01:35:10.422 --> 01:35:13.947]  And incidentally, you were going to play a tape by Ron Paul.
[01:35:15.285 --> 01:35:17.566]  You said you had a two or three minute piece you wanted to play.
[01:35:17.566 --> 01:35:18.406]  Yes, we do have that.
[01:35:18.406 --> 01:35:21.327]  I want to get to that after we take a few calls here, Bob.
[01:35:21.327 --> 01:35:30.330]  I've got time today, if you can do it, to hold a little bit into the next hour before our in-studio guests show up to get into the forced medicating of the water supply.
[01:35:30.330 --> 01:35:32.891]  But yes, that's going to come up after we take some calls.
[01:35:32.891 --> 01:35:37.893]  But specifically, getting back to HR 1207, with over 230 sponsors, last time I checked,
[01:35:42.938 --> 01:35:44.959]  It's going to the floor in the near future.
[01:35:44.959 --> 01:35:47.299]  Incredible debates there.
[01:35:47.299 --> 01:35:48.880]  Then it's probably going to pass the House.
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:49.900]  There's a good chance of that.
[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:51.301]  And then going to the Senate.
[01:35:51.301 --> 01:36:00.924]  But as Ron Paul has said, we win either way because if they fight being audited, if they continue to say they're above the law and secret, that only educates more people.
[01:36:00.924 --> 01:36:05.665]  Five years ago, almost no one knew the Federal Reserve was private or even knew what the Federal Reserve was.
[01:36:05.665 --> 01:36:08.446]  Now the general public knows these are the bad guys.
[01:36:08.446 --> 01:36:10.006]  These are the offshore banks.
[01:36:10.006 --> 01:36:11.187]  And so any way you cut it,
[01:36:11.707 --> 01:36:29.339]  The fact that they're the illegitimate financial government has come out and now, like you said, they're trying to fail forward by becoming the entire government overall and bringing us under international control through this new Bank of the World that Time Magazine and Newsweek and the Wall Street Journal are all pushing.
[01:36:29.339 --> 01:36:36.524]  So there's no more denial about the fact that there's offshore banks trying to set up a world financial dictatorship with physical backing.
[01:36:37.441 --> 01:36:43.645]  The only issue is, will we have a fighting spirit and stand up and say no to this attempted takeover?
[01:36:43.645 --> 01:36:48.489]  You know, people say, well, they're not going to pass it, or, well, they're going to have what they want, or they're invincible.
[01:36:48.489 --> 01:36:49.709]  No, they're not!
[01:36:49.709 --> 01:36:51.471]  Look how far we've come.
[01:36:51.471 --> 01:37:03.579]  I mean, Bob, what has it been like for you, 45, 50 years with G. Edward Griffin and others, an icon in fighting this, and to now see the type of traction we've got, but at the same time to see so many snot-nosed people
[01:37:04.759 --> 01:37:07.961]  Who don't like the New World Order, but saying there's nothing we can do.
[01:37:07.961 --> 01:37:12.023]  I mean, why don't they have a fighting spirit?
[01:37:12.023 --> 01:37:14.804]  I think it's just human nature.
[01:37:14.804 --> 01:37:16.925]  There are certain types of personality out there.
[01:37:16.925 --> 01:37:20.207]  I get letters from these people and I answer them all.
[01:37:20.207 --> 01:37:24.288]  And I'll say, look, if you want to give up, why don't you just go commit suicide?
[01:37:24.288 --> 01:37:26.229]  I mean, to make it simpler.
[01:37:26.229 --> 01:37:29.631]  Of course, I don't think anybody does that, but I think they get the point.
[01:37:29.631 --> 01:37:33.813]  And, you know, I am so, you know, I've been saying this over and over again.
[01:37:34.352 --> 01:37:48.959]  On all the radio stations I've been on for the last three months pushing Ron Paul's agenda in relation to the Federal Reserve, even if we had lost, which it doesn't look like we're going to, we get a shot at winning.
[01:37:48.959 --> 01:37:50.480]  But even if we had lost,
[01:37:51.223 --> 01:37:57.546]  There are millions and millions of people who now know who the enemy is and what they're up to.
[01:37:57.546 --> 01:37:59.547]  Absolutely, and this is a process.
[01:37:59.547 --> 01:38:03.008]  The globalists, it's taken them hundreds of years to build this.
[01:38:03.008 --> 01:38:05.409]  In just a few decades, we are starting to tear it down.
[01:38:05.409 --> 01:38:12.953]  So, they're trying to build it, and as they're building it, we're busy removing bricks to where what they've built is a dysfunctional mess.
[01:38:12.953 --> 01:38:14.433]  It's not going to work.
[01:38:14.433 --> 01:38:15.134]  We're winning.
[01:38:15.134 --> 01:38:20.036]  I mean, resistance and the will to fight is the key component to victory, is it not, Bob?
[01:38:20.754 --> 01:38:29.240]  It certainly is, and that's why I have kept for 50 years, next year it'll be 50 years, I would not give up.
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:40.608]  And, you know, Ed Griffith was in the same boat along with Alan Stang and Anthony J. Hilder, and some of our pals are now deceased, but we're gonna win.
[01:38:40.608 --> 01:38:42.470]  I can feel it.
[01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:46.913]  I know, three weeks ago at the Bilderberg meeting, as you know, they said,
[01:38:47.389 --> 01:38:48.490]  Tops in the agenda.
[01:38:48.490 --> 01:38:50.471]  We think this thing is getting out of control.
[01:38:50.471 --> 01:38:55.315]  We better haul it in here before we're hung out to dry.
[01:38:55.315 --> 01:38:59.278]  Well, the problem for them is they can't haul it in here.
[01:38:59.278 --> 01:39:00.739]  They can't do it.
[01:39:00.739 --> 01:39:02.961]  They're going to have to play it out to the end.
[01:39:02.961 --> 01:39:05.443]  And the end for them is at the end of a rope.
[01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:08.081]  Amazing.
[01:39:08.081 --> 01:39:10.061]  Well, it is us or them, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:10.061 --> 01:39:24.448]  I want to go to Todd and Chris and Joe and Randall and Bill and Nick and many others here in just a moment, but I wanted to get like a three-minute report real fast from Ted Anderson because gold went way up and it dropped some, but still way up on the year.
[01:39:25.928 --> 01:39:33.810]  And I wanted to bring Ted up on this Friday edition, the owner of Genesis Communications, also the owner of Midas Resources, and I've searched around for gold and silver.
[01:39:33.810 --> 01:39:37.071]  This is where I've decided to do my shopping, because they have the best deals.
[01:39:37.071 --> 01:39:45.413]  They have great deals on bullion coins, really collector coins at bullion prices, and collector coins, and some really good deals on collectible silver coins.
[01:39:45.413 --> 01:39:46.813]  Ted Anderson, good to have you here with us.
[01:39:47.233 --> 01:39:48.735]  Yeah, thanks for having me up Alex.
[01:39:48.735 --> 01:39:51.239]  It's very interesting what's going on in the gold market.
[01:39:51.239 --> 01:39:56.767]  You're right, right now the prices are down a little bit and that just makes me want to buy it even more.
[01:39:56.767 --> 01:39:59.752]  Just watching what the Fed is doing and what's going on in Congress.
[01:40:00.316 --> 01:40:12.203]  And that HR 1207 bill, if the people of the United States haven't figured it out yet, if the United States government won't get themselves on a gold standard and silver, then the people of the United States will do it without them.
[01:40:12.203 --> 01:40:14.024]  And that's exactly what's going on.
[01:40:14.024 --> 01:40:17.526]  A lot of people are getting interested in gold and silver coins.
[01:40:17.526 --> 01:40:21.329]  We're seeing a great interest, you know, boil up.
[01:40:21.329 --> 01:40:29.874]  And right now, literally, we have even less than 3%, I would even doubt if the numbers are less than 1% of the people are getting into gold at this time.
[01:40:30.322 --> 01:40:41.508]  By the time 5% of the people wake up and feel that they need to have gold and silver as a part of their portfolio, gold will be over $10,000 an ounce, and silver, who knows?
[01:40:41.508 --> 01:40:48.431]  We'll be at maybe $150,000, $200,000, and the supply is going to be so short, there just won't be enough to go around.
[01:40:48.431 --> 01:40:51.633]  Let me ask Bob that question, because I want him to elaborate.
[01:40:52.748 --> 01:40:57.890]  All these big-time analysts on mainstream TV are saying it's going to go above $2,000, sure thing.
[01:40:57.890 --> 01:41:06.133]  Now, when I start seeing mainstream media come out and say $2,000, I start thinking maybe that isn't going to happen.
[01:41:06.133 --> 01:41:09.135]  Now, when they're saying it isn't, I start thinking it is.
[01:41:09.135 --> 01:41:12.756]  Will gold go above $2,000 an ounce in the near future?
[01:41:12.756 --> 01:41:13.716]  Yes, I think it will.
[01:41:13.716 --> 01:41:20.079]  And I think the reason that they're doing that, and that includes JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup,
[01:41:20.808 --> 01:41:31.277]  And others who are in on this, so to speak, because they want to limit the increase in the price of gold to $2,000 an ounce.
[01:41:31.277 --> 01:41:39.284]  That's why they're giving into that number now at some time in the future, because they don't want it going any higher than that.
[01:41:39.284 --> 01:41:41.385]  And that's what that is all about.
[01:41:41.385 --> 01:41:43.807]  Again, psychological warfare.
[01:41:43.807 --> 01:41:49.152]  They're supplanting in people's minds, that's going to be the top of the market.
[01:41:49.488 --> 01:41:52.750]  It doesn't seem relative right now, but it will later.
[01:42:11.555 --> 01:42:14.696]  1475 down to about 1421.
[01:42:14.696 --> 01:42:20.638]  I've been able to offer the Lakotas back down at that $20 level, which is a really great buy.
[01:42:20.638 --> 01:42:28.020]  I mean, this is one of the coins that really flies in the face of the Fed because, you know, like they're indicting the guy from NorFed.
[01:42:28.995 --> 01:42:30.215]  Right now in legal trouble.
[01:42:30.215 --> 01:42:37.917]  I just don't know how the United States government's going to be able to step in and tell a sovereign nation that they can't have a currency coin.
[01:42:37.917 --> 01:42:47.118]  And we'll see how that plays out, but obviously with what happened to the Norfed coin, they went up so high in price when the Feds came in and did their thing with that.
[01:42:47.118 --> 01:42:50.879]  It shut that organization down and confiscated silver.
[01:42:50.879 --> 01:42:55.600]  It's funny, Ted, I had no idea that you were going to talk about the Liberty Dollar.
[01:42:56.624 --> 01:43:04.906]  When you were coming on today, and I was holding up a Liberty Dollar, because I was about to talk about that as soon as you left us, leave us here in a few minutes.
[01:43:04.906 --> 01:43:12.127]  But absolutely, folks, get into these Lakotas, because they're gorgeous coins, and it may be going down the same road as the Liberty Dollar.
[01:43:12.127 --> 01:43:19.089]  And these suckers go for hundreds and hundreds of dollars an ounce now, because they're now such collectors, because this company got shut down.
[01:43:19.089 --> 01:43:23.849]  Land of the free, home of the brave, can't coin your own silver, can't coin your own gold.
[01:43:23.849 --> 01:43:26.270]  We're going to be breaking that down, coming up a little bit.
[01:43:26.971 --> 01:43:28.272]  Yeah, they can get us at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:43:43.270 --> 01:43:46.832]  Quite a supply of these Lakota coins, so I can deliver them real fast.
[01:43:46.832 --> 01:43:49.833]  And I know that people want to get the gold and silver in their hands.
[01:43:49.833 --> 01:43:54.035]  I mean, if you'd be a fool right now to get certificates, it just doesn't make sense.
[01:43:54.035 --> 01:43:54.636]  Absolutely.
[01:43:54.636 --> 01:43:56.436]  You want to physically hold it.
[01:43:56.436 --> 01:43:56.717]  800-686-2237.
[01:43:56.717 --> 01:43:57.997]  800-686-2237.
[01:43:57.997 --> 01:44:03.720]  The brokers will be there tonight and all weekend.
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:04.580]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:06.061]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[01:44:06.061 --> 01:44:06.401]  You bet.
[01:44:06.401 --> 01:44:09.963]  Bob, I wanted to bring this up and then go to calls, finally, because
[01:44:11.235 --> 01:44:22.282]  Every few weeks I see an article about man arrested at Best Buy, or man arrested at Walmart, or man arrested at drugstore for trying to pay for something with a two dollar bill.
[01:44:23.484 --> 01:44:27.908]  Two dollar bills are Federal Reserve issued, quote, U.S.
[01:44:27.908 --> 01:44:36.575]  Mint issued with the Declaration of Independence on the back, and the public is so ignorant, and the police are so ignorant, they will still take you to jail and charge you.
[01:44:36.575 --> 01:44:38.757]  Usually it gets dropped down the line.
[01:44:38.757 --> 01:44:42.060]  But for those that don't know, it's free association, free barter.
[01:44:43.155 --> 01:44:45.736]  It's against the law to copy U.S.
[01:44:45.736 --> 01:44:46.517]  currency.
[01:44:46.517 --> 01:44:50.279]  The Federal Reserve took that over and does that, so they're really counterfeiters.
[01:44:50.279 --> 01:44:58.803]  But if you counterfeit their counterfeit currency, you go to jail, because that debases and devalues the currency, what the private Federal Reserve is doing themselves.
[01:44:58.803 --> 01:45:07.287]  But if I wanted to go out and strike, say, a thousand coins with my face on them, or your face, or the Easter Bunny's face on them,
[01:45:08.267 --> 01:45:10.188]  Uh, that's my right.
[01:45:10.188 --> 01:45:17.729]  And if somebody wants to barter, and I go, hey, silver's $15 an ounce, you want to give me $15 worth of products for this?
[01:45:17.729 --> 01:45:20.990]  Uh, that would then happen.
[01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:24.651]  And for those that don't know, cities and counties and all over the U.S.
[01:45:24.651 --> 01:45:27.992]  for hundreds of years have barter, have local notes.
[01:45:29.370 --> 01:45:38.832]  The Feds are now going after those groups, so we see them trying to, as they debase the Federal Reserve note, I think getting ready for inflation and that money to be discredited.
[01:45:38.832 --> 01:45:40.612]  Like you said, currency controls?
[01:45:40.612 --> 01:45:50.974]  Not just outside currency controls, trying to trade your dollars as they are imploded in the future, but also where people can't, oh, I'll trade in silver, my own silver, even if it's old U.S.
[01:45:50.974 --> 01:45:57.936]  silver, or I'll trade in gold, whether it's Krugerrands or British Sovereigns or American Ingalls, or, oh, our local town will do script.
[01:45:58.396 --> 01:46:02.978]  You know, that's accepted at the auto repair place and the beauty salon and at the grocery store.
[01:46:02.978 --> 01:46:05.719]  I mean, there's already hundreds of towns and cities doing this.
[01:46:05.719 --> 01:46:06.999]  It's not illegal.
[01:46:06.999 --> 01:46:12.001]  But the feds, it says, Asheville man charged an alleged Liberty Dollar fraud scheme.
[01:46:12.001 --> 01:46:14.642]  They were advertising all over TV and radio.
[01:46:14.642 --> 01:46:16.402]  They were mainstream.
[01:46:16.402 --> 01:46:19.503]  They were just saying alternative currency system.
[01:46:19.503 --> 01:46:21.244]  Totally legal.
[01:46:21.244 --> 01:46:23.045]  And the feds righted them and people said, well,
[01:46:24.025 --> 01:46:32.946]  We believe this is legal, you know, the news, because it's legal to have your own alternate currencies as long as you're not saying you're the Federal Reserve or the Treasury, and they weren't.
[01:46:34.538 --> 01:46:40.162]  And I said, no, folks, they had the gold and silver on hand for their certificates as well, and the feds aren't charging.
[01:46:40.162 --> 01:46:41.283]  They didn't have enough gold and silver.
[01:46:41.283 --> 01:46:42.604]  They stole that.
[01:46:42.604 --> 01:46:47.108]  It was now in the indictments, they admit, saying this is counterfeit.
[01:46:47.108 --> 01:46:58.156]  How is it counterfeit, Bob, to have free association and make your own coins out of a precious metal and sell them, whether it's commemorative or whatever?
[01:46:58.156 --> 01:47:03.440]  Well, it isn't, and I think when you see the court cases that the government will lose
[01:47:04.412 --> 01:47:08.374]  If the government does not lose, you'll know that the courts are rigged.
[01:47:08.374 --> 01:47:09.735]  Because it's not illegal.
[01:47:09.735 --> 01:47:11.276]  It's legal.
[01:47:11.276 --> 01:47:14.377]  The Berkshire dollar is a good example.
[01:47:14.377 --> 01:47:20.721]  It's been in existence for a long time in Massachusetts, particularly western Massachusetts.
[01:47:20.721 --> 01:47:27.624]  And you go and buy a dollar's worth and you pay 97 cents or 95 cents for the Berkshire dollar.
[01:47:31.392 --> 01:47:50.046]  There's nothing wrong with that, but they want to shut all these things down because they don't want anybody competing with the Federal Reserve notes, whether it's in script, like Berkshire, or whether it's in coins that Alex and Bob made up with Ron Paul's face on it.
[01:47:50.046 --> 01:47:52.308]  They don't want anything like that.
[01:47:52.308 --> 01:47:53.609]  It's dictatorial.
[01:47:53.609 --> 01:47:55.050]  You're right back to square one again.
[01:47:55.953 --> 01:48:00.374]  Well, I mean, take Dave & Buster's, for folks who don't have that in their area of the country.
[01:48:00.374 --> 01:48:10.858]  It's a big place with three or four restaurants, and whack-a-mole games, and foosball, and skeetball, and all that stuff, and you can take the kids there and eat dinner.
[01:48:11.838 --> 01:48:15.921]  And then, you know, go spend a few bucks, but you, in the old days, you'd get tokens.
[01:48:15.921 --> 01:48:20.365]  Now, now you get a debit card, but you put your $20 bill in and then you get tokens.
[01:48:20.365 --> 01:48:28.331]  That'd be like the Secret Service hiding out at Dave & Buster's or an arcade arresting the arcade owner for giving people tokens for dollars.
[01:48:29.251 --> 01:48:55.105]  I mean, this is just unbelievable that this is happening, and these guys were out in the open doing nothing wrong, and this coin that I got back in the time for $5, because I let listeners pay for videos with silver coin, it just needs to be denominated, you know, in the amount of the books and videos they buy, and I've gotten quite a bit of silver in the mail over the years, and these collector's items I got for $5 a piece back when silver was at $5,
[01:48:56.820 --> 01:49:00.581]  Five, six years ago, this coin is worth hundreds on eBay.
[01:49:00.581 --> 01:49:07.142]  So I guess I did a pretty good thing, but maybe I'll be arrested, Bob, for even having this, because I'm in such a free country.
[01:49:07.142 --> 01:49:10.383]  Well, you know, that may eventually happen.
[01:49:10.383 --> 01:49:22.266]  You know, government has the ability to outlaw anything, and that's why they have executive orders, which I think should be totally done away with, along with lobbying and campaign finance.
[01:49:22.266 --> 01:49:24.446]  And I have the solutions for them.
[01:49:27.014 --> 01:49:37.540]  The path that we're taking here is that the government is going to, in the future, outlaw lots of things.
[01:49:37.540 --> 01:49:52.528]  And if we have high unemployment, which I think we will have, 35%, maybe 50%, because we're already at 20.4%, and it's not going to be difficult to get much higher.
[01:49:52.528 --> 01:49:55.850]  I think the people will finally say, no, we're not going to do that.
[01:49:56.368 --> 01:50:00.031]  And that's where the steel will meet the brick.
[01:50:00.031 --> 01:50:05.195]  And we're going to find out just how far the government's willing to go.
[01:50:05.195 --> 01:50:09.358]  Well, I mean, my grandmother, still alive, great lady, she remembers being a little girl in
[01:50:13.180 --> 01:50:26.627]  Dallas, and my grandfather was from Dallas as well, and he remembers his daddy having to go turn in their gold, wink wink, they didn't turn it all in, for dollars back from the Federal Reserve.
[01:50:26.627 --> 01:50:37.773]  And then, at half price, what the government said, no gold is worth this much, and then a year later the Feds doubled the price of gold and made profits, and private banks were given that money.
[01:50:37.773 --> 01:50:41.515]  So, I guess if Americans are told today to give their kids to the government,
[01:50:41.835 --> 01:50:44.216]  If they told them, throw your kids off a cliff, they might do it.
[01:50:44.216 --> 01:50:50.138]  We're going to come back and take calls for Bob Chapman, but here's World Net Daily reporting on the Baltimore Sun.
[01:50:50.138 --> 01:50:52.739]  Man arrested for using $2 bill.
[01:50:52.739 --> 01:50:55.220]  Folks, $2 bills even Federal Reserve money.
[01:50:55.220 --> 01:50:55.881]  They don't care.
[01:50:55.881 --> 01:50:58.742]  They have a hunger to put you in prison.
[01:50:58.742 --> 01:50:59.322]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:01.286 --> 01:51:03.287]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:51:03.287 --> 01:51:10.229]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:51:10.229 --> 01:51:18.632]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:51:18.632 --> 01:51:24.374]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:51:24.554 --> 01:51:26.375]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:51:26.375 --> 01:51:28.557]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:51:28.557 --> 01:51:33.100]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:35.321]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:51:35.321 --> 01:51:43.147]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:51:43.407 --> 01:51:43.687]  We're good.
[01:52:01.403 --> 01:52:07.427]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.427 --> 01:52:13.312]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:13.312 --> 01:52:19.476]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:19.796 --> 01:52:21.777]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:21.777 --> 01:52:24.238]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:24.238 --> 01:52:37.424]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:52:37.424 --> 01:52:39.105]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:39.105 --> 01:52:40.946]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:52:40.946 --> 01:52:47.189]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:52:56.121 --> 01:52:57.682]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:57.682 --> 01:53:01.843]  The people strike back.
[01:53:01.843 --> 01:53:12.086]  The New World Order beast is genetically modifying your food, mixing vegetables with animals, and now experimenting with viruses.
[01:53:13.030 --> 01:53:19.019]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[01:53:19.019 --> 01:53:22.484]  Starve or surrender.
[01:53:22.484 --> 01:53:27.371]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[01:53:27.371 --> 01:53:28.472]  What then?
[01:53:30.214 --> 01:53:33.296]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[01:53:33.296 --> 01:53:37.619]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.

[01:54:22.375 --> 01:54:25.356]  All right, Bob Chapman, let's go to some phone calls here.
[01:54:25.356 --> 01:54:30.659]  Bob's gonna be with us for 15 minutes in the next hour, so plenty of time to take your calls.
[01:54:30.659 --> 01:54:41.023]  If you think it's kooky to not want to drink sodium fluoride in your water, wait till we have a doctor here in studio with us coming up later in the next hour.
[01:54:41.023 --> 01:54:44.545]  Todd in Texas, you're on the air with Bob Chapman and Alex Jones.
[01:54:44.545 --> 01:54:44.845]  Go ahead.
[01:54:45.694 --> 01:54:46.514]  Good day, gentlemen.
[01:54:46.514 --> 01:54:52.297]  I am in route to an appointment where I will become a bronze member of the police state control grid.
[01:54:52.297 --> 01:54:53.698]  I'm a Texas educator.
[01:54:53.698 --> 01:54:56.539]  Alex, can you guess what I'm getting ready to go and do?
[01:54:56.539 --> 01:55:01.481]  You're getting ready to go, uh, be biometrically scanned?
[01:55:01.481 --> 01:55:02.161]  Yes, I am.
[01:55:02.161 --> 01:55:06.183]  And let me tell you, it sickens me to the very core of my being, sir.
[01:55:06.183 --> 01:55:08.084]  I've been an educator for 10 years.
[01:55:08.084 --> 01:55:12.246]  I have literally kept kids from committing suicide, and this is how I'm being repaid.
[01:55:13.017 --> 01:55:30.122]  I've contacted my representatives, I've contacted the ACLU, I've contacted the Texas Education Agency, and I didn't realize it, but I really angered the Director of Fingerprinting and Investigations when he said he was just doing his job, and I said that was the defense they used at Nuremberg.
[01:55:30.122 --> 01:55:35.783]  So I just thought I'd commemorate this day by calling in and letting you know.
[01:55:35.783 --> 01:55:38.624]  Well, I guessed, because I know that a lot of educators
[01:55:39.804 --> 01:55:47.629]  We're having to do it right now to get ready for next year to start, but they lie and say you've got to be vaccinated.
[01:55:47.629 --> 01:55:48.109]  You don't.
[01:55:48.109 --> 01:55:50.370]  They lie and say you've got to be fingerprinted.
[01:55:50.370 --> 01:55:51.411]  It is a policy.
[01:55:51.411 --> 01:56:04.799]  They call it a law, but all over the nation and all over the world, this is being standardized and the big think tanks admit to get everybody ready to thumbprint to buy and sell.
[01:56:06.325 --> 01:56:09.472]  Because they're going to skip ahead of the world currency.
[01:56:09.472 --> 01:56:11.597]  You're going to still have regional currencies.
[01:56:11.597 --> 01:56:13.662]  It's just going to all be globally standardized.
[01:56:13.662 --> 01:56:15.927]  This is all under UN treaty already.
[01:56:15.927 --> 01:56:16.308]  And so...
[01:56:17.577 --> 01:56:24.542]  That's why you'll see a 80-year-old man at Walgreens showing his ID to buy pipe tobacco.
[01:56:24.542 --> 01:56:35.349]  I've seen an ancient man on the little four-ended walker, barely able to get his money up to the counter, showing his ID to the missy, literally going, here you go!
[01:56:35.349 --> 01:56:39.072]  Because it's all about mindless, zero-tolerance enforcement.
[01:56:39.072 --> 01:56:41.333]  Oh, the 10-year-old's got in a fistfight.
[01:56:41.333 --> 01:56:42.794]  You go to prison now.
[01:56:42.794 --> 01:56:43.635]  You don't get in trouble.
[01:56:44.415 --> 01:56:58.120]  uh... and and get swats or or get sent home or get patted on the back until good job boys but they're supposed to be to be man it's all about throwing the book at you and so cpa's lawyers uh... uh... people that are
[01:56:59.218 --> 01:56:59.398]  I think?
[01:57:15.683 --> 01:57:20.785]  This is all this, in their own words, cashless society control grid being put in.
[01:57:20.785 --> 01:57:22.505]  Bob Chapman comments on this.
[01:57:22.505 --> 01:57:33.469]  This is the Federal Reserve's omnibus global banking scheme making the slaves only use their currency, only use their system, killing all anonymity, all freedom.
[01:57:33.469 --> 01:57:37.431]  Nothing to do with protecting the kids.
[01:57:37.431 --> 01:57:38.531]  Yes, you're right.
[01:57:38.531 --> 01:57:43.353]  And what they ultimately want is a chip or a debit card
[01:57:44.384 --> 01:57:52.066]  And if you say one thing out of the way about government, your debit card doesn't work anymore, and your chip shuts down.
[01:57:52.066 --> 01:57:54.587]  And this is where they're headed with all this.
[01:57:54.587 --> 01:57:58.488]  And by the way, you know, used to, we didn't even have driver's license.
[01:57:58.488 --> 01:57:59.548]  Then we had driver's license.
[01:57:59.548 --> 01:58:04.730]  Now, if you don't face print, thumb print, hand print, you don't get in Disney World, you don't get in Sea World.
[01:58:05.714 --> 01:58:17.422]  If you don't follow every order we give you, you don't eat, you don't have a job, and now it's guilty until proven innocent, but then the schools will keep the pedophiles working there.
[01:58:17.422 --> 01:58:18.663]  This has nothing to do with that either.
[01:58:18.663 --> 01:58:22.946]  This is about training Todd that he's a slave.
[01:58:22.946 --> 01:58:24.347]  Todd, what do the other teachers think?
[01:58:25.601 --> 01:58:29.603]  Uh, you know, I have a couple people that I've worked with over the years that have slowly come around.
[01:58:29.603 --> 01:58:36.967]  I've given them, I mean, I've passed out literally about 2,000 of your films and found the way in the hands of educators and they've watched it.
[01:58:36.967 --> 01:58:38.668]  Stay there, I want to hear more.
[01:58:38.668 --> 01:58:42.850]  Back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:42.850 --> 01:58:45.491]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.491 --> 01:58:48.673]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.819 --> 01:58:56.666]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[01:58:56.666 --> 01:58:57.987]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:58:57.987 --> 01:59:02.252]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[01:59:02.252 --> 01:59:04.114]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[01:59:04.114 --> 01:59:10.441]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[01:59:11.542 --> 01:59:14.423]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[01:59:14.423 --> 01:59:16.164]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[01:59:16.164 --> 01:59:19.165]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[01:59:19.165 --> 01:59:20.886]  And their formula really works.
[01:59:20.886 --> 01:59:23.707]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[01:59:23.707 --> 01:59:25.188]  Try the NutriCafe.
[01:59:25.188 --> 01:59:29.950]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[01:59:29.950 --> 01:59:32.371]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:59:32.371 --> 01:59:34.832]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[01:59:34.832 --> 01:59:36.933]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[01:59:36.933 --> 01:59:38.514]  Go to www.
[01:59:39.434 --> 01:59:41.295]  Waging War on Corruption!
[01:59:41.295 --> 01:59:43.537]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network!
[01:59:43.537 --> 01:59:44.657]  Big Brother!
[01:59:44.657 --> 01:59:45.538]  Mainstream Media!
[02:00:08.423 --> 02:00:10.185]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.185 --> 02:00:11.766]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.766 --> 02:00:12.706]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.706 --> 02:00:17.530]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.530 --> 02:00:25.957]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.957 --> 02:00:29.560]  Tyrants always try to make the general public criminals.
[02:00:29.560 --> 02:00:31.981]  They criminalize normal activity.
[02:00:31.981 --> 02:00:34.123]  You want to barter somebody for a silver coin?
[02:00:34.123 --> 02:00:34.924]  They SWAT team you.
[02:00:35.953 --> 02:00:40.275]  You want to be a school teacher, a realtor, now almost every profession.
[02:00:40.275 --> 02:00:46.919]  They drug test you, the feds want to make you do that now, not just voluntary if the company owner wants to.
[02:00:46.919 --> 02:00:49.660]  They make you thumbprint, they make you face scan.
[02:00:49.660 --> 02:00:52.982]  The kids have to do this to get their school lunches all over the country.
[02:00:52.982 --> 02:01:02.847]  And the think tank heads admit in these global consortium meetings, we read their minutes on air, that this is about totally controlling and tracking everything you do.
[02:01:02.847 --> 02:01:05.008]  And like Bob said, and like Nick Rockefeller said,
[02:01:05.970 --> 02:01:12.435]  To Aaron Russo in the Reflections and Warnings film that's available by the way at InfoWars.com.
[02:01:12.435 --> 02:01:21.682]  They said right there that, hey, we're going to have Kiss My Butt on our chips and it's going to be on your chip that you're a slave.
[02:01:21.682 --> 02:01:27.006]  And they already have that in California and other states where the police license plates can't be read by the camera scanners.
[02:01:28.032 --> 02:01:28.192]  Yes.
[02:01:28.192 --> 02:01:29.373]  Yes, I'm sorry.
[02:01:29.373 --> 02:01:31.334]  I'm actually in the building right now.
[02:01:31.334 --> 02:01:33.256]  I'm about to be processed into the system.
[02:01:33.256 --> 02:01:35.277]  I'm sorry, I got a little bit distracted.
[02:01:35.277 --> 02:01:45.025]  So, I am actually here in the building, and yes, the police state has come to the tiny town of Robstown, Texas, population 12,000.
[02:01:56.713 --> 02:01:57.694]  No town is exempt.
[02:01:57.694 --> 02:01:58.615]  No town will be free.
[02:01:58.615 --> 02:02:00.036]  Everyone will be processed.
[02:02:00.036 --> 02:02:01.337]  And it's a biometric scanner.
[02:02:01.337 --> 02:02:07.323]  You're going to go right into the International Slave Database, just like... How old are you, Tom?
[02:02:07.323 --> 02:02:07.503]  I'm 34.
[02:02:07.503 --> 02:02:08.004]  Well then, I'm 30...
[02:02:12.509 --> 02:02:14.110]  How old am I?
[02:02:14.110 --> 02:02:17.290]  I'm 35 now.
[02:02:17.290 --> 02:02:30.795]  Going back here, the point I was going to make is everybody at birth who's 36 years old or younger had their blood illegally taken and put in a world DNA database.
[02:02:30.795 --> 02:02:31.775]  I said that for years.
[02:02:31.775 --> 02:02:33.235]  People laughed at me.
[02:02:33.235 --> 02:02:34.616]  Now it's mainstream news.
[02:02:34.616 --> 02:02:36.196]  Let's go back to Bob Chapman.
[02:02:36.196 --> 02:02:41.378]  Bob, again, is this a good government we have that took everybody's blood at birth in the last 36 years?
[02:02:44.188 --> 02:02:46.930]  It's dreadful, and obviously so.
[02:02:46.930 --> 02:02:54.295]  I remember my son is 41, and I remember we had a birthday party for him.
[02:02:54.295 --> 02:02:57.778]  We lived in California at an ice cream place.
[02:02:57.778 --> 02:03:04.262]  And all the kids who were going to school with him, it was the sort of thing that kids did in those days.
[02:03:04.262 --> 02:03:12.068]  And I found out later that the government came in to that company, which handled a number of
[02:03:13.168 --> 02:03:25.630]  Ice cream parlors throughout Southern California, and retrieved all of the information on all of the kids and what their birthday dates were, and all the information they could get on them.
[02:03:25.630 --> 02:03:40.633]  And when he was 21 or 18, they sent him a notice to register for the draft based on that, because there was a mistake in it, and the mistake had been on the original, which was turned in for that party.
[02:03:41.223 --> 02:03:46.051]  That's the kind of things your government does, and they've been doing it for years.
[02:03:46.051 --> 02:03:55.386]  And incidentally, my daughter's a teacher, and she's going to have to come to terms with this stupidness that the government's doing in relation to teachers.
[02:03:57.037 --> 02:03:58.338]  Amazing, yeah.
[02:03:58.338 --> 02:03:59.578]  I mean, think about it.
[02:03:59.578 --> 02:04:06.761]  In Australia, UK, Canada, all over the Western world, for 36 years, is when it started everywhere.
[02:04:06.761 --> 02:04:08.262]  They had some pilot programs.
[02:04:08.262 --> 02:04:13.104]  The Austin American Statesman, a couple months ago, said for 44 years they've been taking your blood at birth.
[02:04:13.104 --> 02:04:15.925]  The documents I have are 36.
[02:04:15.925 --> 02:04:18.706]  But when I was born at Parkland in 1974, 35 years ago, they came in and took my blood.
[02:04:23.088 --> 02:04:25.870]  They came in and did it and sent it off to a UN database.
[02:04:25.870 --> 02:04:32.876]  I mean, you know, this is a rogue government period, Bob, and we've got to get the public to come with grips with that.
[02:04:32.876 --> 02:04:34.497]  We've got to stop cooperating.
[02:04:34.497 --> 02:04:36.418]  They know we're going to stop cooperating.
[02:04:36.418 --> 02:04:38.660]  That's why they want this cashless society grid in place.
[02:04:38.660 --> 02:04:40.101]  Do you agree?
[02:04:40.101 --> 02:04:41.202]  Absolutely.
[02:04:41.202 --> 02:04:47.767]  And all the other things that they're trying to do to get rid of the people like you and I who will speak out about what they're doing.
[02:04:49.912 --> 02:04:51.635]  Well, I guess I'm a terrorist, folks.
[02:04:51.635 --> 02:04:53.278]  I've got silver coin.
[02:04:53.278 --> 02:04:54.460]  So evil.
[02:04:54.460 --> 02:04:56.042]  We'll be right back with Bob Chapman.
[02:04:56.042 --> 02:04:56.744]  More your calls.
[02:04:56.744 --> 02:04:57.224]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.967 --> 02:05:06.170]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:05:06.170 --> 02:05:10.193]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:10.193 --> 02:05:16.096]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:16.096 --> 02:05:21.160]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:21.620]  Number three,
[02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:28.385]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:05:28.385 --> 02:05:31.287]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:05:31.287 --> 02:05:35.791]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:35.791 --> 02:05:39.394]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:05:39.634 --> 02:05:45.377]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[02:05:45.377 --> 02:05:50.080]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:51.841]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:51.841 --> 02:05:54.423]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[02:05:54.423 --> 02:05:57.044]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[02:06:00.566 --> 02:06:01.947]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:06:01.947 --> 02:06:03.948]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:06:03.948 --> 02:06:04.929]  Well, you should.
[02:06:04.929 --> 02:06:09.411]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:06:09.411 --> 02:06:10.212]  That's right.
[02:06:10.212 --> 02:06:18.876]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[02:06:18.876 --> 02:06:20.237]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[02:06:20.237 --> 02:06:21.378]  Plus, if you act fast.
[02:06:21.578 --> 02:06:27.563]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:06:27.563 --> 02:06:34.468]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[02:06:34.468 --> 02:06:39.993]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[02:06:39.993 --> 02:06:41.454]  This is real.
[02:06:41.454 --> 02:06:42.515]  Don't miss out.
[02:06:42.515 --> 02:06:49.380]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:51.060]  And get your free handgun.
[02:06:51.060 --> 02:06:53.421]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[02:06:53.421 --> 02:06:57.122]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com.
[02:06:57.122 --> 02:07:00.863]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[02:07:00.863 --> 02:07:01.483]  Hello, friends.
[02:07:01.483 --> 02:07:02.564]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:07:02.564 --> 02:07:05.524]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[02:07:05.524 --> 02:07:07.285]  And today, that's more important than ever.
[02:07:07.285 --> 02:07:08.485]  We need to be independent.
[02:07:08.485 --> 02:07:10.246]  And food and water is the key.
[02:07:10.246 --> 02:07:13.307]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:07:13.307 --> 02:07:17.108]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[02:07:17.108 --> 02:07:18.008]  In any emergency,
[02:07:18.248 --> 02:07:19.369]  If you simply prepare.
[02:07:19.369 --> 02:07:22.612]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:07:22.612 --> 02:07:29.617]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.
[02:07:29.617 --> 02:07:32.880]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:34.261]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[02:07:38.024 --> 02:07:44.288]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-strided, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[02:07:44.288 --> 02:07:48.050]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:48.050 --> 02:07:49.411]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:49.411 --> 02:07:49.931]  Take action today.
[02:07:49.931 --> 02:07:51.132]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:08:02.091 --> 02:08:04.873]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.873 --> 02:08:12.418]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.418 --> 02:08:21.565]  We got a tour of the Austin Water Treatment Plant yesterday, but they would not let us bring cameras in to videotape the fluoride they were dumping in for national security.
[02:08:21.565 --> 02:08:23.006]  Everything's national security.
[02:08:26.542 --> 02:08:29.404]  Paul uses an excuse for the system to carry out its crimes.
[02:08:29.404 --> 02:08:31.825]  We'll tell you about that coming up in about 25 minutes.
[02:08:31.825 --> 02:08:37.068]  I want to continue quickly now with phone calls, and I ended up keeping the last call on for like 10 minutes.
[02:08:37.068 --> 02:08:38.669]  We've got to be quicker to get everybody in here.
[02:08:38.669 --> 02:08:41.310]  Chris in Tennessee, you're on the air with Bob Chapman, go ahead.
[02:08:41.310 --> 02:08:43.932]  Yeah, hello Mr. Infowarriors, hello Bob.
[02:08:43.932 --> 02:08:49.535]  I want to talk about the Bloomberg story posted on June 17th about the suitcase filled with $134 billion
[02:08:51.793 --> 02:08:51.993]  Okay.
[02:09:08.934 --> 02:09:12.595]  Is the reason why we're involved with the conflict with North Korea today.
[02:09:12.595 --> 02:09:13.576]  And what will this do?
[02:09:13.576 --> 02:09:15.576]  It says it puts the dollar on edge.
[02:09:15.576 --> 02:09:18.177]  Will this finally be the last straw to break the U.S.
[02:09:18.177 --> 02:09:18.858]  economy?
[02:09:18.858 --> 02:09:20.698]  Yeah, I saw that report.
[02:09:20.698 --> 02:09:22.639]  If they transfer them to Euros.
[02:09:22.639 --> 02:09:26.460]  We actually mentioned that yesterday, but I wanted to get Bob's take on that.
[02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:29.241]  For those that don't know about it, Bob, tell them.
[02:09:29.241 --> 02:09:37.064]  Well, the Italian border police at an entry point into Switzerland intercepted
[02:09:38.375 --> 02:09:50.082]  Two Japanese men with false bottoms in their attache cases, which contained $134 billion worth of bonds.
[02:09:50.082 --> 02:09:56.106]  I'm hearing all kinds of differing stories out of Europe as opposed to here.
[02:09:56.106 --> 02:09:59.888]  I don't know what the answer is yet.
[02:09:59.888 --> 02:10:04.932]  Chances are that they may be counterfeits.
[02:10:04.932 --> 02:10:07.113]  I got a story right out of Italy today that said
[02:10:07.759 --> 02:10:08.099]  I don't know.
[02:10:28.666 --> 02:10:33.889]  The government never tells us the truth, so we don't know what we're going to get in the end.
[02:10:33.889 --> 02:10:35.950]  Yeah, this is the issue I want to throw out.
[02:10:35.950 --> 02:10:43.914]  When we've got these Madoffs and all these other criminals running the architecture of the system, that's why there's no audit of the private Federal Reserve.
[02:10:43.914 --> 02:10:54.440]  Can we even imagine the types of money laundering and payoffs and insider trading and scams that we're going to find?
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:55.521]  It'll be colossal.
[02:10:55.521 --> 02:10:58.122]  The hiding of offshore accounts
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:08.265]  That the Fed and the Treasury are both using to buy bonds in our domestic market here.
[02:11:08.265 --> 02:11:17.710]  The money laundering that's going on, the narcotics money, not only via the CIA and MI6, but other organizations.
[02:11:17.710 --> 02:11:22.632]  I mean, the consequences are enormous.
[02:11:22.632 --> 02:11:26.194]  That's why this legislation is so important.
[02:11:28.816 --> 02:11:31.098]  Good point, caller.
[02:11:31.098 --> 02:11:32.980]  I really appreciate you calling and making that point.
[02:11:32.980 --> 02:11:33.480]  Anything else?
[02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:37.203]  Okay, we're going to let him go.
[02:11:37.203 --> 02:11:38.825]  Thank you so much, Chris.
[02:11:38.825 --> 02:11:41.026]  Joe in New York, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:11:41.026 --> 02:11:42.248]  Go ahead.
[02:11:42.248 --> 02:11:44.069]  Hey, Alex and Bob, thanks for all you do.
[02:11:44.069 --> 02:11:46.331]  I just want to tell you about something I found out about yesterday.
[02:11:46.331 --> 02:11:51.996]  This guy I work with, I keep giving him DVDs, we keep talking, but he told me yesterday he's got two cousins.
[02:11:51.996 --> 02:11:53.597]  One of them lives here in Rochester, New York.
[02:11:53.597 --> 02:11:54.738]  The other one's out in California.
[02:11:55.247 --> 02:11:59.268]  The guy in Rochester, New York was out in California for two weeks training for this company.
[02:11:59.268 --> 02:12:01.449]  It's called CBSV.
[02:12:01.449 --> 02:12:05.471]  And he said they're looking for some people, you know, they want to hire, recruit these people that work for him.
[02:12:05.471 --> 02:12:06.471]  So he goes, give him a call.
[02:12:06.471 --> 02:12:08.112]  So I called the guy.
[02:12:08.112 --> 02:12:13.034]  CBSV stands for Consent Based Social Security Number Verification.
[02:12:13.034 --> 02:12:16.595]  He said it was supposed to go, they've been working on this since back January 2008.
[02:12:16.595 --> 02:12:19.576]  It's going to take effect next month.
[02:12:19.576 --> 02:12:22.457]  He said that their website's not up and running yet, but it will be in a month.
[02:12:23.174 --> 02:12:34.404]  And he said, you know, he's got my number, he picked up his cell phone, and he said that if you want some information right now, you can Google, Google Red Flag Rules or Red Flag Compliance.
[02:12:34.404 --> 02:12:39.508]  And again, it's called CBSV, Consent-Based Social Security Number Verification.
[02:12:39.508 --> 02:12:42.531]  It's going to be all used, and every bank and every hospital is going to have this.
[02:12:43.288 --> 02:12:46.710]  And I just want to get your take, you know, I'm just trying to find out more about it.
[02:12:46.710 --> 02:12:49.631]  Yeah, for those that don't know, I know I'm aware of it and I'm glad you brought it up.
[02:12:49.631 --> 02:12:52.793]  They're federalizing forcibly all health care.
[02:12:52.793 --> 02:12:56.855]  They are federalizing all the major corporations.
[02:12:56.855 --> 02:12:59.377]  The Federal Reserve is taking them over forcibly.
[02:13:00.253 --> 02:13:09.616]  They're using their regulatory power to grab healthy banks, insurance companies, credit unions, and feed it into the gaping mouth of this system.
[02:13:09.616 --> 02:13:16.738]  And yes, they're federalizing all the health care, everything, all the data, everything you do.
[02:13:16.738 --> 02:13:21.119]  Point of transaction will be run through the feds, and Homeland Security has said
[02:13:22.563 --> 02:13:27.665]  If you're not in good favor with them, you're not going to be allowed to have a job.
[02:13:27.665 --> 02:13:31.667]  If you have bad credit, you're going to be on a no-fly list.
[02:13:31.667 --> 02:13:35.649]  They're now saying if you're on a no-fly list, you won't be able to own a firearm.
[02:13:35.649 --> 02:13:39.391]  And they're going to expand that to tens of millions, not just millions of Americans.
[02:13:39.391 --> 02:13:44.813]  And so this is the new control grid where they have these warrantless Kafka-esque or 1984 lists
[02:13:47.074 --> 02:13:49.616]  People always ask about red and blue lists, and those are real.
[02:13:49.616 --> 02:13:51.997]  But they also have this harassment list.
[02:13:51.997 --> 02:13:57.560]  This list of where you're persona non grata and can't travel, can't live, can't eat.
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:00.562]  And so then you're homeless, then you're not allowed to be homeless.
[02:14:00.562 --> 02:14:01.963]  They take you to the camp.
[02:14:01.963 --> 02:14:03.824]  I told people that over a decade ago.
[02:14:03.824 --> 02:14:06.446]  Now in California and Hawaii, they don't let you be homeless.
[02:14:06.446 --> 02:14:08.267]  They take you to a camp.
[02:14:08.267 --> 02:14:11.229]  So Bob Chapman, your take on that?
[02:14:11.229 --> 02:14:15.051]  It's absolutely unbelievable, but it's happening.
[02:14:15.646 --> 02:14:18.727]  And you're going to see more and more and more of this.
[02:14:18.727 --> 02:14:24.990]  It's just the government takeover of the people and the loss of freedom that's involved.
[02:14:24.990 --> 02:14:37.175]  And all we can do is what we can do, but Alex, you know, your program is bringing all this information out to the public and at least people can be aware of it and know what's going on.
[02:14:37.175 --> 02:14:44.839]  Well, for those that are just tuning in for the first time, this is classical tyranny with a high-tech interweaving or overlay
[02:14:45.988 --> 02:14:49.570]  And they attack us all incrementally.
[02:14:49.570 --> 02:14:57.415]  They attack us individually, and we've been trained not to know our neighbors, not to get involved, not to help, to all be isolated.
[02:14:57.415 --> 02:14:59.916]  And it's because we're isolated, they're able to do this.
[02:14:59.916 --> 02:15:13.404]  We have to first stand up and say, I'm mad, I'm angry, you're criminals, we're going to expose you, we're saying no, and get on the offensive and call for their audit, their arrest, instead of just laying here while they do that.
[02:15:13.404 --> 02:15:14.164]  Thank you, Joe.
[02:15:14.164 --> 02:15:14.925]  Bill in Florida.
[02:15:15.205 --> 02:15:18.946]  You're on the air with Bob Schaben, The International Forecaster.com.
[02:15:18.946 --> 02:15:23.308]  Yes, well first Alex, I wanted to tell you thank you for everything you're doing out here.
[02:15:23.308 --> 02:15:26.109]  I subscribed to your PrisonPlanetTV.com.
[02:15:26.109 --> 02:15:29.750]  I also picked up your Obama inception and your Aaron Russo.
[02:15:29.750 --> 02:15:30.370]  God bless you.
[02:15:30.370 --> 02:15:32.991]  We couldn't operate without people like you.
[02:15:32.991 --> 02:15:35.992]  I also have a problem, of course, with waking up my family.
[02:15:35.992 --> 02:15:37.652]  It's like a joke.
[02:15:37.652 --> 02:15:39.333]  And the other thing I wanted to say
[02:15:40.413 --> 02:15:45.960]  I speak out, I post videos all the time speaking out, and I promote your stuff as well.
[02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:47.942]  And I had a question on the food.
[02:15:47.942 --> 02:15:52.968]  Do you really think gold is going to be any good if they use food as a weapon against people?
[02:15:53.632 --> 02:15:56.373]  Well, look, I've always said I believe gold's a good investment.
[02:15:56.373 --> 02:16:01.174]  It has intrinsic industrial value and barter value for 6,000 years.
[02:16:01.174 --> 02:16:03.494]  And also, we've got to fund this operation, so I promote it.
[02:16:03.494 --> 02:16:06.455]  I mean, I only promote things I believe in.
[02:16:06.455 --> 02:16:08.155]  So it's a win-win-win.
[02:16:08.155 --> 02:16:15.357]  And I believe in gold and silver, and people that invested in it have made three, four times their investment when all other investments aren't doing well.
[02:16:15.357 --> 02:16:20.218]  I know big banks and brokerage firms and insurance companies are quietly moving into gold and silver.
[02:16:20.218 --> 02:16:22.219]  I know the elites hoard gold and silver.
[02:16:22.819 --> 02:16:25.762]  But no, I'm not saying just gold and silver.
[02:16:25.762 --> 02:16:29.967]  I'm saying have storable food, number one, water filters, second amendment.
[02:16:29.967 --> 02:16:32.289]  Then if you have discretionary other assets...
[02:16:33.322 --> 02:16:36.624]  Put a portion of it in gold and silver.
[02:16:36.624 --> 02:16:40.247]  And not even as an investment, but as an insurance policy.
[02:16:40.247 --> 02:16:43.349]  I've always said invest in it because it can't be fully reduced overnight.
[02:16:43.349 --> 02:16:46.471]  People say, well then they could come and forcibly confiscate it.
[02:16:46.471 --> 02:16:48.833]  They could come take you and take you to a gulag too!
[02:16:48.833 --> 02:16:50.174]  That's the whole point!
[02:16:50.174 --> 02:16:59.940]  Is we're doing whatever we can to be independent, to be in their system but out of their system, to be in Babylon but not of Babylon.
[02:16:59.940 --> 02:17:02.322]  Look, Bob Chapman, you want to explain this to him?
[02:17:03.407 --> 02:17:05.188]  You only can do what you can do.
[02:17:05.188 --> 02:17:06.408]  You lay the groundwork.
[02:17:06.408 --> 02:17:12.790]  You get the food, the filter, the weapons, and extra money goes into gold and silver coins.
[02:17:12.790 --> 02:17:15.331]  If you want to speculate, you can buy the stocks as well.
[02:17:15.331 --> 02:17:17.892]  It all depends on how much money you've got.
[02:17:17.892 --> 02:17:19.813]  That's the starting point.
[02:17:19.813 --> 02:17:23.734]  But there's some people that can't do anything because they don't have the money to do it.
[02:17:23.734 --> 02:17:25.795]  Well, you just do what you can do.
[02:17:25.795 --> 02:17:28.656]  But government can do anything it wants.
[02:17:29.940 --> 02:17:32.482]  The longer they wait, the better it is for us.
[02:17:32.482 --> 02:17:35.965]  And the reason why is we're informing more people.
[02:17:35.965 --> 02:17:39.108]  Hopefully we can get legislation passed on the Fed.
[02:17:39.108 --> 02:17:51.559]  Hopefully that'll be followed by legislation on the elimination of free trade and the implementation of tariffs on goods and services.
[02:17:51.559 --> 02:17:53.241]  We're gaining time here.
[02:17:53.241 --> 02:17:56.103]  They're gaining time, too, to do the things that they want to do.
[02:17:57.234 --> 02:18:08.438]  Yeah, they want this, exactly, they want this financial straitjacket on us so they can then use finance to control us with just a backup of paramilitary force.
[02:18:08.438 --> 02:18:13.880]  That's why we've got a scream bloody murder now, because they don't have their grid in place, do they Bob?
[02:18:13.880 --> 02:18:14.921]  No they don't.
[02:18:14.921 --> 02:18:26.245]  And they're afraid, as we hark back to the meeting of the Bilderbergers in Greece recently, and they said, we're losing control, we've got to fold this thing in soon.
[02:18:27.028 --> 02:18:29.629]  Because, or try again later.
[02:18:29.629 --> 02:18:32.109]  Because the people know too much.
[02:18:32.109 --> 02:18:33.870]  It hasn't worked out the way we wanted.
[02:18:33.870 --> 02:18:38.211]  Iraq was an absolute disaster for them.
[02:18:38.211 --> 02:18:39.532]  And they've said that themselves.
[02:18:39.532 --> 02:18:44.633]  Brzezinski said that a couple of years ago, if not longer.
[02:18:44.633 --> 02:18:47.434]  And so we got a good shot at this.
[02:18:47.434 --> 02:18:48.694]  But you got to be prepared.
[02:18:48.694 --> 02:18:52.115]  So if you have the funds, get the fundamentals.
[02:18:52.115 --> 02:18:53.776]  And get them in place.
[02:18:53.776 --> 02:18:55.136]  And people who have more money,
[02:18:55.455 --> 02:19:00.757]  Who have questions that need answered, all they have to do is email me and I'll answer their questions.
[02:19:00.757 --> 02:19:02.938]  It doesn't cost them anything.
[02:19:02.938 --> 02:19:07.500]  In fact, speaking of that, TheInternationalForecaster.com to get a free e-copy.
[02:19:07.500 --> 02:19:09.120]  And Bob, do you have that toll-free number?
[02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:16.143]  Because I know Midas Resources is offering a free hard copy of the latest issue for anybody that wants to call.
[02:19:16.143 --> 02:19:16.783]  That's correct.
[02:19:16.783 --> 02:19:18.824]  They are and they always are.
[02:19:18.824 --> 02:19:19.424]  That number is 877-479-8178.
[02:19:24.707 --> 02:19:26.429]  Toll free 877-479-8178.
[02:19:26.429 --> 02:19:31.734]  Alright, briefly.
[02:19:31.734 --> 02:19:33.997]  Caller, did that answer your question?
[02:19:33.997 --> 02:19:35.879]  Yes, it did, and I thank you.
[02:19:35.879 --> 02:19:36.659]  God bless you.
[02:19:36.659 --> 02:19:41.524]  Bob Chapman, we'll see you next Friday, God willing.
[02:19:41.524 --> 02:19:42.325]  You better believe it.
[02:19:43.228 --> 02:19:43.909]  Alright, you're the best.
[02:19:43.909 --> 02:19:45.852]  Bob Chapman, take care my friend.
[02:19:45.852 --> 02:19:46.052]  Thank you.
[02:19:46.052 --> 02:19:46.893]  Bye bye.
[02:19:46.893 --> 02:19:50.298]  Our websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:19:50.298 --> 02:19:53.602]  I want to thank that caller earlier who's a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[02:19:53.602 --> 02:19:56.126]  That's how you watch us live here each day.
[02:19:56.126 --> 02:19:59.250]  I'm going to come back and play this Ron Paul clip on the other side.
[02:19:59.250 --> 02:19:59.671]  Stay with us.
[02:20:01.055 --> 02:20:03.396]  This is Alex Jones for American Tax Settlement.
[02:20:03.396 --> 02:20:12.919]  We have received news that the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements on back taxes, and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of dollars.
[02:20:12.919 --> 02:20:20.921]  If any of you out there owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, we have created an open phone line with American Tax Settlement.
[02:20:20.921 --> 02:20:26.863]  For all Alex Jones listeners to see if you qualify for a settlement with the IRS to save thousands, the number to call is 1-800.
[02:20:27.723 --> 02:20:28.304]  We're good to go.
[02:20:48.882 --> 02:20:49.643]  We're good.
[02:21:01.055 --> 02:21:07.277]  How would you like to cook any meal using no electricity or gas and cook your meals off the grid?
[02:21:07.277 --> 02:21:09.898]  Well, now you can, thanks to the Survival Oven.
[02:21:09.898 --> 02:21:17.660]  The Survival Oven is the most amazing off-grid solar oven that can cook anything that a conventional oven can without the energy bills.
[02:21:17.660 --> 02:21:29.744]  By condensing sunlight, the Survival Oven can produce temps up to 350 degrees, cook delicious and nutritious meals, sterilize water, dehydrate food, and so much more, all at zero operating costs.
[02:21:29.964 --> 02:21:30.224]  I think so.
[02:21:48.215 --> 02:21:52.658]  At less than 10 pounds, you can take Survival Solar Oven with you anywhere.
[02:21:52.658 --> 02:21:53.959]  Call 877-642-1553 or go to survivaloven.com.
[02:21:53.959 --> 02:21:55.120]  That's survivaloven.com.
[02:22:01.576 --> 02:22:07.598]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:22:07.598 --> 02:22:13.499]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:22:13.499 --> 02:22:19.641]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:22:19.981 --> 02:22:21.962]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:22:21.962 --> 02:22:24.424]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:22:24.424 --> 02:22:37.613]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:22:37.613 --> 02:22:39.274]  It's not about left or right.
[02:22:39.274 --> 02:22:41.136]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:22:41.136 --> 02:22:47.360]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:22:48.047 --> 02:22:56.289]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:56.289 --> 02:22:57.869]  The Obama Deception.
[02:22:57.869 --> 02:23:01.590]  The people strike back.
[02:23:01.590 --> 02:23:03.611]  Hi, I'm John Swenson at Midas Resources.
[02:23:03.611 --> 02:23:04.111]  800-686-2237, extension 128.
[02:23:04.111 --> 02:23:05.751]  And let's take in a brief mind mover.
[02:23:09.875 --> 02:23:15.537]  We're surrounded by jesters, members of the nation's largest clown club based in Washington, D.C.
[02:23:15.537 --> 02:23:21.358]  Fuzzy hair, baggy pants, big yellow shoes, and now offering financial assurances that all will be well.
[02:23:21.358 --> 02:23:23.359]  The stimulus package is working.
[02:23:23.359 --> 02:23:25.239]  A bailout is coming your way.
[02:23:25.239 --> 02:23:29.421]  And while we're flat broke, we're also told that we've stepped back away from the brink.
[02:23:29.421 --> 02:23:30.581]  Pardon me?
[02:23:30.581 --> 02:23:31.821]  Back to the real world.
[02:23:31.821 --> 02:23:36.082]  We know that we can rely on no one but ourselves to generate financial security.
[02:23:36.082 --> 02:23:38.063]  Protecting your assets is solely up to you.
[02:23:38.638 --> 02:23:40.339]  No one else is coming to the rescue.
[02:23:40.339 --> 02:23:51.804]  Please call me, John Swenson, 800-686-2237, extension 128, to discuss investing in precious metals, gold and silver, with a 6,000 year track record of success and security.
[02:23:51.804 --> 02:23:58.807]  I'm John Swenson, 800-686-2237, extension 128, and together we'll create a package that really works for you.
[02:24:03.324 --> 02:24:09.025]  Coming up, I'm going to show you what they're putting in the Austin water supply.
[02:24:09.025 --> 02:24:12.746]  I have some order requests.
[02:24:12.746 --> 02:24:17.747]  The actual chemicals being dumped in there by the government.
[02:24:30.185 --> 02:24:37.543]  Hydrofluorosilic acid H2SiF6 and other goodies.
[02:24:37.543 --> 02:24:38.766]  That is coming up.
[02:24:40.114 --> 02:24:47.941]  Alright, this is a short clip, but Ron Paul is now going out on TV saying, this gives the bankers more power than Congress has over the country.
[02:24:47.941 --> 02:24:51.204]  And that's what the quote, overhaul of the private banks is.
[02:24:51.204 --> 02:24:55.287]  The Federal Reserve is their private consortium, or their holding company.
[02:24:55.287 --> 02:25:00.752]  So they're saying, give the private banks that did all this, more power to stop it from happening in the future.
[02:25:02.332 --> 02:25:05.517]  Which they promised back in October, give us more power and we'll fix it.
[02:25:05.517 --> 02:25:08.402]  And I told you, they've already been given unlimited financial power.
[02:25:08.402 --> 02:25:13.270]  Now they want power over other corporations and companies to seize any company, take over anything they want.
[02:25:13.991 --> 02:25:16.152]  And it's the same thing across the board.
[02:25:16.152 --> 02:25:17.653]  Shutting down farms and ranches.
[02:25:17.653 --> 02:25:19.114]  NAIS.
[02:25:19.114 --> 02:25:20.515]  Premises ID.
[02:25:20.515 --> 02:25:25.438]  I mean, this is a corporate takeover of every level of society.
[02:25:25.438 --> 02:25:28.200]  Then there's some big Iran news I haven't gotten to.
[02:25:28.200 --> 02:25:30.241]  That's clearly a CIA operation.
[02:25:30.241 --> 02:25:32.543]  First few days I said, we'll wait and see.
[02:25:32.543 --> 02:25:34.784]  The mullahs do have some corrupt problems.
[02:25:34.784 --> 02:25:36.465]  They may have stolen the election.
[02:25:36.465 --> 02:25:38.587]  Definitely CIA op now.
[02:25:38.587 --> 02:25:39.628]  They've been caught doing that.
[02:25:39.628 --> 02:25:42.870]  In fact, I meant to get to it yesterday, but now even more evidence has come out.
[02:25:44.751 --> 02:25:55.480]  During the break, I'll find the photos for you, where they would crop photos of people protesting for Ahmadinejad, and they would say it was people against him, and BBC got caught doing that.
[02:25:55.480 --> 02:25:58.882]  They've had to admit they've staged it, but that's not it.
[02:25:58.882 --> 02:26:05.528]  They're always on TV with signs in English, and people have been picking them out as CIA people from the U.S.
[02:26:06.667 --> 02:26:12.171]  Just like when they tore Saddam's statue down and they showed close shots of five or six guys like it was a crowd.
[02:26:12.171 --> 02:26:15.934]  It turns out it was just a few dozen people and it was all CIA ops.
[02:26:15.934 --> 02:26:19.096]  We're not saying the Mullahs are good or Saddam's good.
[02:26:19.096 --> 02:26:22.039]  The issue is it's staged.
[02:26:22.039 --> 02:26:29.564]  Just know they're lying to you on the news and trying to overthrow Iran.
[02:26:29.564 --> 02:26:32.306]  Our government already did that in 53 to these poor people.
[02:26:32.306 --> 02:26:34.288]  No wonder they hate us so much.
[02:26:34.288 --> 02:26:35.609]  Stay out of their business!
[02:26:36.684 --> 02:26:39.667]  People are like, no, I'll kill him, I like being in an empire.
[02:26:39.667 --> 02:26:41.970]  The same empire is raping you too?
[02:26:41.970 --> 02:26:45.013]  You're not part of the empire, you pay for it!
[02:26:45.013 --> 02:26:47.976]  You're the slave that pays for it.
[02:26:47.976 --> 02:26:51.239]  You're a slave working in a factory for the New World Order.
[02:26:51.239 --> 02:26:53.602]  Stop thinking like you're part of it.
[02:26:53.602 --> 02:26:55.624]  Oh, these yuppies just can't figure it out.
[02:26:55.624 --> 02:26:58.006]  These good old boys just can't figure it out.
[02:26:58.006 --> 02:26:59.228]  Let's play Ron Paul, here he is.
[02:27:00.768 --> 02:27:06.333]  Is your perspective that Tim Geithner needs to dramatically change his approach at this point?
[02:27:06.333 --> 02:27:15.262]  We've seen Paul Krugman and other economists say the worst thing that could happen right now is for the government to ease up on the stimulus and other things, that it could lead to another crash.
[02:27:15.262 --> 02:27:15.923]  What are your thoughts?
[02:27:16.687 --> 02:27:23.210]  Well, it would be good to stimulate the economy, but you don't stimulate it by doing the same thing we've done for 20 years.
[02:27:23.210 --> 02:27:27.913]  And the policies that gave us our trouble can hardly be the solution.
[02:27:27.913 --> 02:27:33.936]  So spending more money and borrowing more money and inflating the currency will not solve the problem.
[02:27:33.936 --> 02:27:37.598]  They're making the assumption that it was lack of regulations that caused our trouble.
[02:27:38.098 --> 02:27:45.002]  And yet we had banking regulators and we had SEC regulators and FDIC regulators.
[02:27:45.002 --> 02:27:47.604]  We had a ton of regulations and they failed.
[02:27:47.604 --> 02:27:49.085]  So they say, well, we just need more.
[02:27:49.085 --> 02:27:52.927]  It's sort of like what the outcome of Enron was.
[02:27:52.927 --> 02:27:54.308]  We passed Sarbanes-Oxley.
[02:27:54.308 --> 02:27:59.371]  Now they're trying to repeal Sarbanes-Oxley because it contributed to the problems of the early part of this decade.
[02:27:59.691 --> 02:28:11.139]  So I would say they're on the wrong course, and to me it's very, very disturbing that they have no confidence in the free market, and they have no interest whatsoever in looking at the root cause.
[02:28:11.139 --> 02:28:21.886]  And the root cause is easy credit, artificially low interest rates, inflating the currency, excessive spending, excessive debt, too much taxes, and they're going in the wrong direction.
[02:28:21.886 --> 02:28:29.531]  And believe me, there's reason for the polls to be shifting away from the administration because they're digging a bigger hole.
[02:28:29.891 --> 02:28:36.233]  But Congressman Paul, the first thing you said in that line was easy credit.
[02:28:36.233 --> 02:28:45.656]  Are you not at all concerned with the role, for example, that some of the credit rating agencies played in that, which in part allowed people to, A, get more access to credit.
[02:28:45.656 --> 02:28:48.797]  I don't just mean individuals, but I mean large corporations.
[02:28:48.797 --> 02:28:51.898]  Are you not at all concerned that some of the regulations weren't well enforced?
[02:28:52.881 --> 02:28:58.464]  Well, what you're trying to say is the regulations could compensate for the easy credit.
[02:28:58.464 --> 02:29:08.830]  It wasn't the regulators who created the credit, it was the Federal Reserve that pumps up the money supply and artificially lowers the interest rates, and then the regulators are supposed to come in and adjust.
[02:29:08.830 --> 02:29:14.794]  You might say the housing bubble should have been stopped by the regulators, but Congress and the regulators actually forced
[02:29:15.254 --> 02:29:16.775]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:29:16.775 --> 02:29:18.456]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[02:29:18.456 --> 02:29:18.736]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.488 --> 02:29:55.411]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.

[02:31:00.828 --> 02:31:06.689]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[02:31:06.689 --> 02:31:07.989]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[02:31:07.989 --> 02:31:12.270]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[02:31:12.270 --> 02:31:14.131]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[02:31:14.131 --> 02:31:19.072]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award.
[02:31:19.332 --> 02:31:19.832]  We're good to go.
[02:31:49.472 --> 02:31:49.953]  We're good.
[02:32:00.902 --> 02:32:06.107]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:32:06.107 --> 02:32:10.131]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:10.131 --> 02:32:16.037]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:16.037 --> 02:32:21.122]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:21.122 --> 02:32:21.563]  Number three,
[02:32:22.023 --> 02:32:28.309]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:32:28.309 --> 02:32:31.212]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:32:31.212 --> 02:32:35.736]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:35.736 --> 02:32:39.340]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:32:39.580 --> 02:32:45.301]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[02:32:45.301 --> 02:32:50.002]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:50.002 --> 02:32:51.783]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:51.783 --> 02:32:54.343]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[02:33:16.011 --> 02:33:31.020]  Alright, we're going to finish up this quick Ron Paul clip.
[02:33:31.020 --> 02:33:39.985]  I get to the key point where he explains that it's the Federal Reserve that put out all this fiat currency and credit, and that they are going to get more power than Congress.
[02:33:41.007 --> 02:33:45.051]  Through this new, quote, overhaul of regulation.
[02:33:45.051 --> 02:33:48.475]  Giving the banks unlimited power when they've engineered this crisis.
[02:33:48.475 --> 02:33:50.197]  That's supposedly their answer.
[02:33:50.197 --> 02:33:52.639]  Give the people that did this more power.
[02:33:52.639 --> 02:33:55.002]  Thinking the public and Congress are stupid.
[02:33:55.002 --> 02:33:59.987]  Not knowing the Federal Reserve is a private holding company for the big central banks.
[02:33:59.987 --> 02:34:00.368]  Here it is.
[02:34:02.094 --> 02:34:07.023]  You say you want to get rid of some of this stuff, but obviously there was some missing regulation.
[02:34:07.023 --> 02:34:09.848]  Maybe the SEC didn't have enough correct people there.
[02:34:09.848 --> 02:34:12.693]  So, you know, where do you regulate?
[02:34:13.942 --> 02:34:19.883]  Well, what your statement says is it proves regulation didn't work, or that it was misdirected.
[02:34:19.883 --> 02:34:22.004]  The regulation should be on the Federal Reserve.
[02:34:22.004 --> 02:34:24.244]  We should have transparency of the Federal Reserve.
[02:34:24.244 --> 02:34:30.125]  They can create trillions of dollars to bail out their friends, and we don't even have any transparency of this.
[02:34:30.125 --> 02:34:32.165]  They're more powerful than the Congress.
[02:34:32.165 --> 02:34:34.286]  So yeah, we do need regulation.
[02:34:34.286 --> 02:34:40.347]  But isn't the Treasury Secretary, I mean one thing about this new plan for the administration is that they actually do want to try...
[02:34:40.427 --> 02:34:41.668]  You can read our key stories.
[02:34:41.668 --> 02:34:46.110]  We've been screaming this for the last three days since they made this legislation public.
[02:34:46.110 --> 02:34:50.233]  And now we have the headline, Ron Paul slams Federal Reserve's new dictatorial powers.
[02:34:50.233 --> 02:34:53.875]  They can already steal all the money they want and have no one audit them unless we change the law.
[02:34:55.422 --> 02:34:59.883]  But now they're going to be able to seize any company or corporation.
[02:34:59.883 --> 02:35:06.464]  I mean, this is, Hitlerian is the only way to properly describe the full magnitude of this.
[02:35:06.464 --> 02:35:08.465]  So we're going to continue to cover that.
[02:35:08.465 --> 02:35:17.326]  I'm going to get Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on to talk about this and his investigation of what's really happening in Iran and North Korea coming up this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:35:17.326 --> 02:35:20.447]  with the Sunday syndicated transmission.
[02:35:21.047 --> 02:35:30.809]  Now, coming up in about 30 minutes, we're going to have two people in studio, but right now we have Dr. Neil Karman, and he is a Ph.D.
[02:35:30.809 --> 02:35:41.412]  in biology and also in several other areas, and we really appreciate him coming on, biology and chemistry, because he works with some of the local
[02:35:42.512 --> 02:35:42.632]  Yeah.
[02:36:01.334 --> 02:36:04.136]  Where they get this fluoride, what it really is.
[02:36:04.136 --> 02:36:06.018]  There's thousands of government reports.
[02:36:06.018 --> 02:36:11.883]  I've had top EPA scientists themselves, the majority of them have signed letters saying, please take this out.
[02:36:11.883 --> 02:36:12.863]  It's deadly.
[02:36:12.863 --> 02:36:15.646]  They know it gives bone cancer, especially men.
[02:36:15.646 --> 02:36:28.676]  I mean, I consider in rant and rave that it calcifies in all the organs, but I mean, you're a PhD in mainly plant biology, but you also study what's happening with mammals as well and can really speak to this.
[02:36:28.676 --> 02:36:30.818]  So it's great to have you here with us, Doc.
[02:36:31.257 --> 02:36:32.998]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:36:32.998 --> 02:36:41.783]  Well, the concerns I have is I worked in laboratories for a long time and it's well known that fluoride is a very toxic substance.
[02:36:41.783 --> 02:36:49.347]  It's been known since about 1900 that fluorine in various forms, whether it's an industrial chemical,
[02:36:49.987 --> 02:36:54.949]  Such as they're adding to the Austin's water supply.
[02:36:54.949 --> 02:37:02.953]  Or even some naturally occurring fluorides have a certain degree of toxicity to humans, animals and plants.
[02:37:02.953 --> 02:37:05.614]  And so this has been known worldwide for a long time.
[02:37:05.614 --> 02:37:13.417]  There's actually a journal, Fluoride, that is devoted to the toxicology and the health problems worldwide.
[02:37:13.997 --> 02:37:29.581]  Uh, that different cultures have with naturally occurring fluorides, but we also have industrial fluorides, uh, that are produced to use, uh, in the, um, refining industry to make high-octane gasoline, uh, and... The cracking of the oil?
[02:37:30.001 --> 02:37:42.870]  Yes, and those facilities, when they use fluoride rather than, they use hydrofluoric acid rather than sulfuric acid, it is the worst case accidental release scenario from those types of facilities.
[02:37:42.870 --> 02:37:46.893]  It's used in the computer industry to etch silicon chips.
[02:37:47.513 --> 02:37:53.438]  Uh, because it eats, uh, hydrofluoric acid, in this case, uh, will actually eat glass.
[02:37:53.438 --> 02:37:54.278]  It eats concrete.
[02:37:54.278 --> 02:37:56.760]  It's a very corrosive acidic material.
[02:37:56.760 --> 02:38:03.245]  Um, and so, the reason I'm very concerned about the city of Austin and many other cities in the U.S.
[02:38:03.245 --> 02:38:07.789]  adding, uh, fluoride to the water is because, um, they're adding
[02:38:08.249 --> 02:38:23.822]  An industrial hazardous waste byproduct of the phosphate fertilizer industry and much of it comes from Florida where they do strip mining for the phosphate rock and fluorine is a very common element in the environment.
[02:38:24.182 --> 02:38:25.882]  It's more common than carbon.
[02:38:25.882 --> 02:38:27.883]  So there is a lot of fluorine out there.
[02:38:27.883 --> 02:38:37.585]  But in the process of mining and processing this phosphate rock to make phosphate fertilizer, they must remove the fluoride because it would be harmful.
[02:38:37.585 --> 02:38:42.706]  It would kill the crops if they left it in their phosphate fertilizers.
[02:38:42.706 --> 02:38:49.268]  So they remove it and they have wet scrubbers in several of these fertilizer manufacturing plants in Florida.
[02:38:49.728 --> 02:39:04.154]  And then they produced a waste with this fluoride in it, and the product that the city buys from a chemical company in Florida that gets it from these phosphate fertilizer plants is hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:39:04.154 --> 02:39:16.360]  Okay, we're going to go over what that is because I've had other scientists and doctors on, and there was that famous dentist who got Canada 20 years ago fluoridated, and then he went, oh my god, I thought this was calcium fluoride, which a little bit of it is good for you.
[02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:19.941]  No, this isn't even sodium fluoride.
[02:39:19.941 --> 02:39:43.113]  This is a catch-all for a whole bunch of toxic waste they just dump, and it goes back, of course, for those that don't know, the Manhattan Project, they first had to secretly, because they didn't want spies being able to tell what they were doing by what was being shipped out, so they started in Tennessee and other areas dumping the different fluoride byproducts from purifying the uranium into the rivers.
[02:39:43.573 --> 02:39:48.295]  And they found, hey, we can do this and it doesn't kill all the fish right away if we don't make it obvious.
[02:39:48.295 --> 02:39:55.638]  So they said, what do we do with all this toxic waste of aluminum, fertilizer, uranium, plutonium purification?
[02:39:55.638 --> 02:39:57.139]  We'll put it in the water.
[02:39:57.139 --> 02:40:01.040]  Just like depleted uranium, they had all this left over from the nuclear industry.
[02:40:01.040 --> 02:40:03.001]  So they said, we'll make it a weapons system.
[02:40:03.001 --> 02:40:05.362]  And we'll just say it's good for you and not a problem.
[02:40:05.362 --> 02:40:07.923]  And so now they're even putting it in construction materials.
[02:40:07.923 --> 02:40:09.364]  So what they're doing is dosing
[02:40:09.884 --> 02:40:16.995]  Poison out, kind of like our ancestors 5,000 years ago would just dump toxic waste right in the river and let somebody handle it downstream.
[02:40:16.995 --> 02:40:18.717]  Now they put it directly into the water.
[02:40:18.717 --> 02:40:20.260]  But listen, I'm not a chemist.
[02:40:20.260 --> 02:40:25.127]  I'm not a degreed scientist biologist like you are in chemistry and biology, but I know this.
[02:40:25.968 --> 02:40:29.490]  When it rains on my yard, the grass goes crazy and turns bright green.
[02:40:29.490 --> 02:40:30.771]  The plants are happy.
[02:40:30.771 --> 02:40:34.873]  When it's a drought and I've got to water plants myself, the grass turns yellow.
[02:40:34.873 --> 02:40:38.775]  They don't even like water hose city water.
[02:40:38.775 --> 02:40:46.419]  So I'm no scientist, but I know, and any gardener I know, says collect rainwater, whatever, don't water your plants with it.
[02:40:46.419 --> 02:40:50.421]  If I put a goldfish in tap water, it will die by the next day.
[02:40:51.401 --> 02:40:58.227]  So I've got to put chemicals in it or or or get a purified water to put my kids goldfish in so why am I drinking it?
[02:40:59.485 --> 02:41:13.630]  Well, fluoride is being added to the water out of this claim from the 1940s and the 1950s that's really based on bad science, that it would help children primarily prevent tooth decay as they're developing.
[02:41:13.630 --> 02:41:27.494]  But they knew there was a trade-off, and that is that about 10% of the children would develop a condition known as dental fluorosis, which is a staining, a brown discoloration of the teeth that is not very attractive.
[02:41:27.614 --> 02:41:28.955]  Plus bone fractures?
[02:41:28.955 --> 02:41:29.896]  Bone fractures, yes.
[02:41:29.896 --> 02:41:35.020]  Because fluoride, actually the fluorine, will replace calcium in the bones.
[02:41:35.020 --> 02:41:42.325]  So you get the bones becoming more brittle and it can aggravate people with osteoarthritis.
[02:41:43.686 --> 02:41:45.347]  And this isn't debated, it's all admitted.
[02:41:45.347 --> 02:41:58.392]  So when I interrupted you, and I want to get back into that, Doc, you started getting into what the chemical is they're putting, what this catch-all term is, and then tell us about this particular document, I want to give people a close-up of, you got from the city of Austin.
[02:41:58.922 --> 02:42:06.244]  Yes, we have contract information and also a copy of the material safety data sheet.
[02:42:06.244 --> 02:42:12.426]  And there's one from Mosaic, which is the manufacturer of the chemical.
[02:42:12.426 --> 02:42:19.068]  And then also it's actually sold through a kind of a front company called Lucier Chemical Industries in Florida.
[02:42:19.068 --> 02:42:23.789]  But they admit to the city, and the city told us yesterday that they get it from Mosaic.
[02:42:23.789 --> 02:42:27.670]  Mosaic is a merger of Cargill and IMC Global.
[02:42:27.970 --> 02:42:35.252]  Which both operate large phosphate fertilizer manufacturing plants and do the strip mining of the phosphate rock in Florida.
[02:42:35.252 --> 02:42:40.133]  And this is just distillate crap they'd have to pay to store in the desert, instead they give it to us.
[02:42:40.133 --> 02:42:46.935]  Well, it's actually classified by the Environmental Protection Agency as a hazardous industrial waste.
[02:42:47.515 --> 02:42:53.161]  That they can't put into the water, the rivers, because it would be too toxic.
[02:42:53.161 --> 02:42:55.222]  They're not supposed to dump it on the land.
[02:42:55.222 --> 02:42:57.945]  They can't put it into the air because it's so harmful.
[02:42:57.945 --> 02:43:03.130]  And so they sell it to the cities to put in small amounts, they claim.
[02:43:03.130 --> 02:43:08.055]  And by the way, other scientists I've had on have made the point, fluoride and its different
[02:43:08.615 --> 02:43:10.057]  It's a bio-cumulative poison.
[02:43:23.875 --> 02:43:32.303]  And so this is one of the things that the city and other municipalities around the country don't take into account, is that fluoride is bio-cumulative.
[02:43:32.303 --> 02:43:37.687]  But this is a toxic industrial waste that the public in the U.S.
[02:43:37.687 --> 02:43:47.636]  is not aware is being added to the water supply compared to the natural fluoride mineral salts that are in the water, but at lower concentrations.
[02:43:47.796 --> 02:43:54.718]  And by the way, it says on here for the workers dumping this in the water, don't touch this, it'll burn you, it'll kill you, it's deadly, just make sure they drink it.
[02:43:54.718 --> 02:43:59.259]  And it'll actually, these fluoride compounds actually will penetrate the skin.
[02:43:59.259 --> 02:44:01.980]  They're very toxic.
[02:44:01.980 --> 02:44:10.863]  Well, I mean, just studying nerve gases that the military developed, most of them are fluoride-based, so I don't understand how they're putting it in our water.
[02:44:11.567 --> 02:44:29.262]  Well, that was kind of, it's bad science, it's whatever you want to call it, but there's no epidemiological studies where you've had a fluoridated community on these specific industrial waste products where they've looked for possible health effects.
[02:44:29.262 --> 02:44:38.209]  But three years ago at the Harvard Medical School, four researchers published a paper in a journal on cancer in which they compared
[02:44:39.450 --> 02:44:53.294]  They found higher levels of bone cancer, osteosarcoma, a rare type of cancer in boys 7 to 8 years of age in a fluoridated community compared to a non-fluoride drinking community.
[02:44:53.294 --> 02:45:02.257]  So they found that there was elevated rates of osteosarcoma and, you know, the study has some limitations because they looked at a small group of people.
[02:45:02.257 --> 02:45:03.938]  There's a whole bunch of studies around the world.
[02:45:05.198 --> 02:45:11.701]  We know that fluoride is extremely toxic and there's definitely concerns that it is a human cancer-causing.
[02:45:11.701 --> 02:45:13.102]  Well, have you heard the new thing?
[02:45:13.102 --> 02:45:18.804]  They're now saying mercury is good for you because it's coming out that it's in half the corn syrup.
[02:45:18.804 --> 02:45:20.745]  That's Washington Post.
[02:45:20.745 --> 02:45:22.446]  It's coming out that it's in many products.
[02:45:22.446 --> 02:45:26.128]  So the new spin is that mercury is actually good for you.
[02:45:26.628 --> 02:45:27.429]  I'm not kidding.
[02:45:27.429 --> 02:45:31.170]  Guys, go to YouTube and Google News Says Mercury Good For You.
[02:45:31.170 --> 02:45:35.253]  I'm going to play that off local news, Austin, because I don't want the doc to think I'm making this up.
[02:45:35.253 --> 02:45:39.375]  You're going to see Fred Cantu tell you that mercury is good for you here in just a moment.
[02:45:39.375 --> 02:45:40.855]  But please continue.
[02:45:40.855 --> 02:45:43.497]  Well, anyway, so there's actually many studies.
[02:45:43.497 --> 02:45:55.263]  Three years ago, the National Research Council had a panel of 13 scientists who are experts in toxicology, epidemiology, fluoride, and chemistry.
[02:45:55.603 --> 02:45:55.823]  Thank you.
[02:46:11.881 --> 02:46:25.464]  And they basically determined that the EPA's maximum contaminant level of four parts per million is not protective of human health, and that it should be set much lower.
[02:46:25.464 --> 02:46:37.367]  But EPA hasn't done anything, and so the city of Austin's position is that as long as their fluoride level that they add to the water is less than this four parts per million level, they think it's safe.
[02:46:37.367 --> 02:46:40.688]  But the British, the Russian, the Chinese studies I've seen
[02:46:41.588 --> 02:46:44.169]  Show that it's cumulative, so that's a fraud.
[02:46:44.169 --> 02:46:44.469]  Right.
[02:46:44.469 --> 02:46:47.569]  And also, they don't take into account that there's other fluorides.
[02:46:47.569 --> 02:46:52.930]  There's fluoride in the food, beverages that are made with fluoridated water.
[02:46:52.930 --> 02:46:54.290]  There's quite a bit of it in tea.
[02:46:54.290 --> 02:46:58.211]  People brush their teeth with fluoride-containing toothpaste, mouthwashes.
[02:46:58.211 --> 02:47:02.552]  There's some pharmaceuticals that some people take that have fluoride in it.
[02:47:02.552 --> 02:47:03.472]  Prozac.
[02:47:03.472 --> 02:47:07.693]  There's fluorinated pesticides, so there could be some on the fruit.
[02:47:08.833 --> 02:47:10.134]  And now they want to spray it.
[02:47:10.134 --> 02:47:14.418]  In fact, I saw it a few years ago, that a lot of the new pesticides are fluoride-based.
[02:47:14.418 --> 02:47:17.360]  It kills the bugs, and we sit there and eat it like fools.
[02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:29.090]  Yeah, because actually, what we know, so there's a lot of fluoride exposure from different sources, and so the city of Austin doesn't take into account this wide exposure.
[02:47:29.090 --> 02:47:31.372]  Well, we know the lobbyists come in and pay them off.
[02:47:31.372 --> 02:47:32.393]  I mean, that's what's going on.
[02:47:33.416 --> 02:47:40.820]  I mean, they'll arrest you if you get caught dumping motor oil on the street, and you should be, but I'd much rather have motor oil going around than fluoride that's killing everything.
[02:47:40.820 --> 02:47:43.421]  I mean, fish can't live in tap water.
[02:47:43.421 --> 02:47:45.042]  Why are we drinking it?
[02:47:45.042 --> 02:47:51.725]  Doc, again, I'm no doctor, but why does a goldfish die in a matter of hours?
[02:47:51.725 --> 02:47:57.828]  Everybody should try this, and I don't think it's nice to be cruel to fish, but if it saves human lives, do it.
[02:47:57.828 --> 02:48:00.049]  In the sixth grade, you cut up frogs.
[02:48:00.049 --> 02:48:02.591]  I think the schools, if it's so good, ought to fill up.
[02:48:03.251 --> 02:48:03.872]  I think
[02:48:20.069 --> 02:48:21.089]  Get the message across.
[02:48:21.089 --> 02:48:23.911]  And the animal rights activists will say, don't kill goldfish.
[02:48:23.911 --> 02:48:29.433]  And whereas I don't enjoy killing goldfish, I've got one at my house that's seven years old named Fluffy we're very attached to.
[02:48:29.433 --> 02:48:35.456]  If it'll save human lives, how are we going to then not hurt goldfish because it's cruel, but make everybody drink this?
[02:48:36.141 --> 02:48:48.367]  Well, what the National Research Council report came out with in 2006 is that the level of fluoride being added to the water is 250 times higher than what is in breast milk.
[02:48:48.367 --> 02:48:54.549]  And breast milk, we know mother's milk, it's got a trace, trace level of natural fluoride.
[02:48:54.549 --> 02:48:55.590]  Because you need a trace amount.
[02:48:55.590 --> 02:48:57.231]  You need a small amount.
[02:48:57.231 --> 02:48:59.131]  Don't humans even need a trace amount of cyanide?
[02:48:59.131 --> 02:49:00.152]  But you don't want a lot of it.
[02:49:00.717 --> 02:49:11.905]  Right, but the whole thing is that there's a very, very low level, and so what they're adding to the water is much higher, 250 times higher than what is considered really safe.
[02:49:11.905 --> 02:49:19.430]  And actually, some of the researchers said that with babies there is really no safe level of what's in the water.
[02:49:19.650 --> 02:49:21.031]  Well, that was my next point, Doc.
[02:49:21.031 --> 02:49:33.461]  When I go to Babies R Us, it's all give your kids fluoride pills, buy the fluoridated water for your baby, and all the studies I've seen say it's three to four times worse for kids' brains and bones than it is for adults.
[02:49:33.461 --> 02:49:34.201]  Is that what you're getting at?
[02:49:34.201 --> 02:49:35.222]  Is it really bad for kids?
[02:49:35.382 --> 02:49:36.882]  Yes, yes.
[02:49:36.882 --> 02:49:56.487]  What we know, and this was first recognized in the 1950s by researchers who were studying enzymes, and all of our cells in our body run partially on enzymes, they're part of the assembly lines that keep everything going, and fluoride poisons at least 62 enzyme systems in the human body.
[02:49:56.487 --> 02:49:58.148]  Unbelievable.
[02:49:58.148 --> 02:49:59.368]  So it's an endocrine disruptor.
[02:49:59.608 --> 02:50:13.994]  Yes, and so some of the early opposition in the 1950s to fluoridation were the biochemists researching enzymes because they knew that fluoride was a powerful poison that interfered with enzymes in the body.
[02:50:13.994 --> 02:50:19.517]  Oh, and as soon as that research came out, oh, put it in the water, and the Rockefellers just so happened to be eugenicists.
[02:50:19.517 --> 02:50:22.398]  But I'm sure, Doc, there's nothing to do with that.
[02:50:22.398 --> 02:50:23.759]  We should just trust them and drink it.
[02:50:24.298 --> 02:50:33.305]  Well, it is interesting that one of the fluoride compounds used in the manufacture of uranium is uranium hexafluoride.
[02:50:33.305 --> 02:50:34.686]  It's a catalyst.
[02:50:34.686 --> 02:50:39.049]  And so that was one of the ways that this kind of links back to the Manhattan Project.
[02:50:39.049 --> 02:50:41.912]  Uranium hexafluoride, it's got six fluorine atoms in it.
[02:50:42.412 --> 02:50:44.734]  It's been well known, but it's also very toxic.
[02:50:44.734 --> 02:50:56.245]  So in using this in the Manhattan Project, along with using other fluoride catalysts in the aluminum industry to smelt aluminum and to various kinds of aluminum products in the steel industry.
[02:50:56.245 --> 02:50:57.766]  Gotta break there, stay there Doc.
[02:50:57.766 --> 02:50:58.747]  This is riveting stuff.
[02:50:58.747 --> 02:51:00.068]  Very important.
[02:51:00.068 --> 02:51:00.829]  Drink your uranium.
[02:51:01.349 --> 02:51:02.610]  Economy have you down?
[02:51:02.610 --> 02:51:04.291]  Scared you might lose your job?
[02:51:04.291 --> 02:51:06.373]  Worried how you will provide for your family?
[02:51:06.373 --> 02:51:08.495]  Do you worry where your money will come from?
[02:51:08.495 --> 02:51:11.797]  You know that the economy is getting worse, but there is hope.
[02:51:11.797 --> 02:51:16.320]  Robert Beadle's new book, Here's What You Do, tells you what to do and how to do it.
[02:51:16.320 --> 02:51:19.903]  Even a 10-year-old can figure it out after reading this 72-page book.
[02:51:19.903 --> 02:51:20.784]  And the best part?
[02:51:20.784 --> 02:51:22.825]  This book is priced under $10.
[02:51:22.825 --> 02:51:24.747]  Don't be the victim, be a victor!
[02:51:24.747 --> 02:51:26.848]  Go to hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:51:26.848 --> 02:51:28.709]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:51:28.709 --> 02:51:30.010]  Again, hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:51:30.891 --> 02:51:31.431]  We're good to go.
[02:52:01.211 --> 02:52:02.733]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:52:02.733 --> 02:52:08.118]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[02:52:08.118 --> 02:52:10.521]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[02:52:10.521 --> 02:52:19.650]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by calling the bailout grid.
[02:52:19.710 --> 02:52:20.150]  I think?
[02:52:49.650 --> 02:52:49.850]  We're good.
[02:53:01.710 --> 02:53:07.213]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[02:53:07.213 --> 02:53:08.014]  and the world.
[02:53:08.014 --> 02:53:11.876]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[02:53:11.876 --> 02:53:18.380]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[02:53:18.380 --> 02:53:20.401]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[02:53:20.401 --> 02:53:28.346]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[02:53:28.626 --> 02:53:33.332]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[02:53:33.332 --> 02:53:39.140]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[02:53:39.140 --> 02:53:41.323]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[02:53:41.323 --> 02:53:43.566]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[02:53:43.906 --> 02:53:45.007]  Free of charge.

[02:53:58.034 --> 02:53:59.315]  FDA?
[02:53:59.315 --> 02:54:03.997]  I'm sick of your glasses and contact lenses.
[02:54:03.997 --> 02:54:06.679]  A new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[02:54:06.679 --> 02:54:09.921]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporter Seema Mathur.
[02:54:12.722 --> 02:54:19.187]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[02:54:19.187 --> 02:54:25.613]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[02:54:25.613 --> 02:54:32.979]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:38.864]  Everybody knows the dice are loaded, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:38.864 --> 02:54:40.566]  Everybody knows the good guy's lost.
[02:54:51.899 --> 02:54:59.204]  That aired two years ago.
[02:54:59.204 --> 02:55:02.647]  We have Dr. Neil Harmon.
[02:55:02.647 --> 02:55:12.314]  He's a biologist and also a chemist in here with us, and he's fighting locally to expose how deadly poison fluoride is and the other varieties.
[02:55:12.314 --> 02:55:16.637]  I'm reading on here, Doc, and it's saying what's in the stuff they put in the awesome water.
[02:55:16.637 --> 02:55:18.499]  You just got a tour after months of trying.
[02:55:19.099 --> 02:55:19.440]  Of course!
[02:55:32.779 --> 02:55:34.980]  Right, it's only one of the compounds.
[02:55:34.980 --> 02:55:37.802]  There's actually three forms of fluorine in there.
[02:55:37.802 --> 02:55:43.205]  There's the hydrofluorosilicic acid, which is the primary fluoride the city is seeking.
[02:55:43.205 --> 02:55:51.790]  There's also some elemental fluorine, and there's hydrofluoric acid, and then there's heavy metals, lead, cadmium, chromium.
[02:55:52.430 --> 02:55:54.731]  Well, that's where they mine it, is out of the... Yeah.
[02:56:13.621 --> 02:56:19.906]  There's huge deposits of phosphate rock in Florida, and it has a lot of impurities in it.
[02:56:19.906 --> 02:56:23.949]  Fluorine is just one of the impurities, but there's also... And they don't even purify this.
[02:56:23.949 --> 02:56:30.635]  That's what the other doctors have said, and the EPA people I've had on admit that they call it fluoride.
[02:56:30.635 --> 02:56:36.580]  Oh, we fluoridate, but really they just take the toxic waste of all these industries and just put it in our water.
[02:56:37.130 --> 02:56:47.134]  Well, the city, the city claimed to us that there is some kind of distillation or filtration, but they don't, you know, they haven't supplied any documents as to what that is.
[02:56:47.134 --> 02:56:56.537]  I know that the company they buy it from, uh, it basically is just kind of like a, a warehouse to, you know, store the chemicals and sell them, uh, loose air chemicals.
[02:56:56.537 --> 02:57:02.920]  But Mosaic, uh, I, I don't know what they do, but it's possible that it's just basically directly sold.
[02:57:02.920 --> 02:57:05.601]  Uh, it's brought here in a large tanker truck.
[02:57:07.062 --> 02:57:09.866]  And they declared national security.
[02:57:09.866 --> 02:57:14.432]  We wanted to get cameras in and they wouldn't let us have cameras saying national security.
[02:57:14.432 --> 02:57:17.716]  And I guess it is national security to give us this toxic chemical.
[02:57:18.328 --> 02:57:25.010]  Well, their issue with that, Alex, is that you've got this drinking water supply for the whole city of Austin.
[02:57:25.010 --> 02:57:26.870]  Somebody might put poison in it like them!
[02:57:26.870 --> 02:57:27.871]  Right, right.
[02:57:27.871 --> 02:57:47.156]  So, you know, but what's interesting is that the fluoridation storage at the water treatment plant is in a kind of, it's in a totally contained building with warnings on it because of the corrosive nature of the hydrofluorosilicic acid that they store there in two fiberglass tanks.
[02:57:47.416 --> 02:57:48.617]  Skull and crossbones.
[02:57:48.617 --> 02:57:59.461]  So it's a self-contained building that cost a great deal to construct and to operate this because of the hazardous nature of this chemical that they're adding to the water.
[02:58:00.347 --> 02:58:00.827]  Amazing.
[02:58:00.827 --> 02:58:07.652]  Now, coming in, you got to see that clip, because I know it sounds crazy when I say that the news is saying mercury is good for your brain.
[02:58:07.652 --> 02:58:10.294]  That was a national report, a local version of it.
[02:58:10.294 --> 02:58:12.916]  It was put out by CBS News as a press release.
[02:58:12.916 --> 02:58:19.101]  I also have a clip, in time I'm not going to play it, saying lead is good for children on MSNBC.
[02:58:19.101 --> 02:58:20.522]  Doctor, does that sound normal to you?
[02:58:21.122 --> 02:58:26.285]  No, because basically there's different pediatricians who have done research in the U.S.
[02:58:26.285 --> 02:58:33.369]  on lead, and people like Dr. Phil Landrigan, who was here in Austin two months ago, say there is no safe level of lead exposure.
[02:58:33.369 --> 02:58:34.770]  What about mercury, though?
[02:58:34.770 --> 02:58:43.574]  And mercury is also highly toxic, so... I mean, that's vitamin M. We'll be right back in 60 seconds.
[02:58:43.574 --> 02:58:46.056]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:50.888 --> 02:58:52.269]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:58:52.269 --> 02:58:54.270]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:58:54.270 --> 02:58:55.251]  Well, you should.
[02:58:55.251 --> 02:58:59.733]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:58:59.733 --> 02:59:00.554]  That's right.

[02:59:54.069 --> 02:59:56.470]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.470 --> 02:59:59.292]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:12.105 --> 03:00:16.192]  Alright, in the next segment we've got Ray Nadler Olnick coming in.
[03:00:16.192 --> 03:00:26.828]  She heads up fluoridefreeaustin.com fighting the city council that gives the lobbying money for these chemical companies to take the byproducts of the petrochemical industry.
[03:00:27.909 --> 03:00:33.654]  And the fertilizer industry, the aluminum purification industry, and it dumps it right in our water supply.
[03:00:33.654 --> 03:00:42.261]  And we're talking to a PhD doctor of chemistry and biology, Dr. Neil Carman.
[03:00:42.261 --> 03:00:49.387]  Doc, is there a particular way for people to read your research or a website where people can find out more about you, or is the best place just fluoridefreeaustin.com?
[03:00:49.747 --> 03:01:07.546]  Well, Dr. Paul Conant in New York has a great website, fluoridealert.org, and he has a list of over 2,535 professionals, PhDs, medical doctors, dentists, nurses, and other... Neurologists.
[03:01:07.546 --> 03:01:10.650]  ...who have signed on to this professional statement.
[03:01:11.611 --> 03:01:17.537]  Calling for an end to fluoridation in the United States, because in Europe there is virtually no fluoridation.
[03:01:17.537 --> 03:01:25.026]  They determined over there, based on medical toxicology and health studies, that this is not good to be doing to the public.
[03:01:25.026 --> 03:01:26.147]  And it weakens teeth!
[03:01:26.147 --> 03:01:30.072]  I mean, my dad's a dentist and didn't believe me, and over the years I gave him documents and he now agrees I'm right.
[03:01:30.612 --> 03:01:32.013]  Yes, yes.
[03:01:32.013 --> 03:01:33.274]  So actually the U.S.
[03:01:33.274 --> 03:01:37.418]  is the primary country in the world where fluoridation is commonly practiced.
[03:01:37.418 --> 03:01:39.620]  Well look, I was never a hypochondriac.
[03:01:39.620 --> 03:01:41.021]  I got sick like twice a year.
[03:01:41.021 --> 03:01:43.704]  I could have a broken collarbone and not want to go to the doctor.
[03:01:43.704 --> 03:01:45.225]  So I wasn't imagining it.
[03:01:45.225 --> 03:01:46.806]  I would brush my teeth real good.
[03:01:46.806 --> 03:01:48.087]  My daddy was a dentist.
[03:01:48.087 --> 03:01:50.390]  And I always remember laying down on the couch having a headache.
[03:01:50.990 --> 03:01:58.576]  Where I almost got to where I didn't like to brush my teeth until I was finally about 16, 17 and I figured I could go to the store and buy Toms of Maine without it.
[03:01:58.576 --> 03:02:02.840]  I figured out, before I ever heard of this, that fluoride was giving me headaches.
[03:02:03.396 --> 03:02:08.938]  Well, and actually, every toothpaste container that has fluoride in it in the U.S.
[03:02:08.938 --> 03:02:19.102]  is required to have a toxic warning label that if a child ingests too much of this, they are supposed to call the Poison Control Center.
[03:02:19.102 --> 03:02:27.065]  Now, 20-25 years ago, there was actually a skull and crossbones warning label on every toothpaste and box of toothpaste because of the fluoride that they've added.
[03:02:27.910 --> 03:02:39.686]  So the toothpaste is a big issue because already children are getting dosed every time they brush their teeth, they're getting some fluoride, they're ingesting... A lot!
[03:02:39.686 --> 03:02:43.932]  They say if you get a pea-sized amount, most kids swallow that much, call poison control immediately.
[03:02:44.232 --> 03:02:44.813]  The kids don't.
[03:02:44.813 --> 03:02:46.895]  They eat the toothpaste, go collapse on the couch.
[03:02:46.895 --> 03:02:49.839]  And I've seen the studies about IQ reduction.
[03:02:49.839 --> 03:02:51.140]  I mean, it's a fact.
[03:02:51.140 --> 03:02:54.544]  Then they make jokes about it, kind of like now I say mercury's bad for you.
[03:02:54.544 --> 03:02:55.605]  And they go, no, I saw the news.
[03:02:55.605 --> 03:02:56.246]  It's good.
[03:02:56.246 --> 03:02:57.668]  You're a conspiracy theorist.
[03:02:57.668 --> 03:02:58.969]  You're a chemist.
[03:02:58.969 --> 03:03:00.271]  You're somebody who studied biology.
[03:03:00.271 --> 03:03:01.592]  You're a scientist.
[03:03:01.592 --> 03:03:02.794]  Is mercury good for the brain?
[03:03:03.294 --> 03:03:04.454]  I don't think so.
[03:03:04.454 --> 03:03:11.917]  I haven't seen evidence that I subscribe to that mercury has any health benefits to the body.
[03:03:11.917 --> 03:03:16.578]  Well under an electron microscope at the University of Calgary we've shown, in fact I want to show people that.
[03:03:16.578 --> 03:03:28.901]  Google electron microscope video mercury brain tissue and this is monkey brain tissue and it's the only heavy metal they found that causes an electrochemical almost explosion chain reaction.
[03:03:28.901 --> 03:03:30.082]  Normal plaques
[03:03:31.002 --> 03:03:36.265]  It just builds up as a plaque and only kills what it touches, but this causes an electrochemical short circuit.
[03:03:36.265 --> 03:03:37.545]  Right, I've seen that.
[03:03:37.545 --> 03:03:42.688]  It looks very well done, because it shows the neuron shrinking away from the mercury.
[03:03:42.688 --> 03:03:44.549]  But maybe you haven't had enough mercury, Doc.
[03:03:44.549 --> 03:03:47.050]  Maybe that's why you think it's bad.
[03:03:47.050 --> 03:03:51.392]  Maybe if you'd eat more, you could join the rest of the normal people that can hardly talk now.
[03:03:51.392 --> 03:03:53.693]  Have you seen how a lot of adults can hardly talk now?
[03:03:53.693 --> 03:03:56.415]  Maybe you need more mercury and fluoride, Doc.
[03:03:56.815 --> 03:04:08.845]  Well, we've known actually, if you study biochemistry like I took, you know, a long time ago, one of the classic ways to basically kill protein function is with heavy metals like lead and mercury.
[03:04:08.845 --> 03:04:14.790]  So we've known for a long time that these toxic metals are very bad for biological systems.
[03:04:14.790 --> 03:04:16.932]  Dr. Karman, everybody knows mercury is good.
[03:04:16.932 --> 03:04:18.173]  That's why they give it to kids.
[03:04:18.173 --> 03:04:21.355]  That's why they have mercury bottles at the Whole Foods.
[03:04:21.355 --> 03:04:24.298]  If you go there in the vitamin section, it's vitamin M.
[03:04:26.584 --> 03:04:28.024]  Well, I disagree.
[03:04:28.024 --> 03:04:30.365]  I think mercury is extremely harmful.
[03:04:30.365 --> 03:04:41.587]  We've seen studies where a single gram of mercury, which is about the size of a grain of rice, will contaminate a 20-acre lake so that the fish are too toxic with methylmercury concentrations to eat.
[03:04:41.587 --> 03:04:42.387]  But wait!
[03:04:42.387 --> 03:04:44.587]  The government says it's good.
[03:04:44.587 --> 03:04:47.448]  Why don't you just trust them and be a patriot?
[03:04:47.448 --> 03:04:53.689]  I mean, you know, I think I should just drink mercury on air and prove to everybody this is nutritious and good.
[03:04:54.878 --> 03:04:55.479]  Uh, you know what?
[03:04:55.479 --> 03:04:56.279]  This is extreme.
[03:04:56.279 --> 03:05:01.384]  We're gonna come back more and talk about these people that don't think we should be drinking sodium fluoride.
[03:05:01.384 --> 03:05:02.005]  Hello, friends.
[03:05:02.005 --> 03:05:03.066]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:05:03.066 --> 03:05:07.810]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:05:07.810 --> 03:05:10.773]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:05:10.773 --> 03:05:13.816]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:05:13.816 --> 03:05:18.540]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[03:05:18.760 --> 03:05:19.901]  If you simply prepare.
[03:05:19.901 --> 03:05:23.122]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:05:23.122 --> 03:05:30.125]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[03:05:30.125 --> 03:05:33.406]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[03:05:33.406 --> 03:05:33.646]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[03:05:36.087 --> 03:05:38.549]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[03:07:02.085 --> 03:07:05.088]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:07:05.088 --> 03:07:10.413]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:07:10.413 --> 03:07:12.475]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:07:12.475 --> 03:07:17.159]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:07:19.076 --> 03:07:19.376]  We're good.
[03:07:35.708 --> 03:07:36.708]  We're good to go!
[03:08:06.164 --> 03:08:11.007]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:08:11.007 --> 03:08:12.588]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.588 --> 03:08:14.149]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:14.149 --> 03:08:18.352]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.352 --> 03:08:23.435]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:23.435 --> 03:08:32.580]  Ray Nadler Olnick, who heads up fluoridefreeaustin.com, is now joining us in studio with Dr. Neil Carmen, who I have been
[03:08:34.110 --> 03:08:58.735]  Bringing up a lot of points, but I want to give him a few minutes before we go to her, and then get her take on this as she's fighting it in Austin and around the country, and certainly people should contact her there if you want to get involved with Fluoride Free Austin, because I would like to have, we have great aquifer water here, and I'd like to not have to be drinking water that I have shipped in from Arkansas, or water that I drink out of my big Berkey, because even with that,
[03:08:59.575 --> 03:08:59.956]  I think so.
[03:09:14.372 --> 03:09:19.915]  You're exposing fluoride and then talking about the one way to make sure you're not drinking it, atmospheric water generators.
[03:09:19.915 --> 03:09:20.835]  So that's coming up in a moment.
[03:09:20.835 --> 03:09:36.463]  But sir, you were talking about Google Earth during the break and zooming in on these mines where the byproduct are all these different things, not just the fluoride type chemicals that are being put in our water supply and other points that need to be made.
[03:09:37.063 --> 03:09:52.055]  Yes, there's a county in Florida where a group of these plants that Mosaic and several other companies operate, it's Polk County, near the cities, small cities called, let's see, one is Bartow and also Mulberry.
[03:09:52.055 --> 03:10:00.682]  And right around those cities you see these large strip mining operations for the phosphate rock and that's where the phosphate fertilizer manufacturing plants are located.
[03:10:01.022 --> 03:10:11.791]  And then you can also see large waste piles of the phosphogypsum that's too contaminated with the radionuclides, uranium and thorium.
[03:10:11.791 --> 03:10:13.132]  They don't know what to do with it.
[03:10:13.132 --> 03:10:17.755]  The state of Florida, the EPA, these companies, it's too toxic to sell anywhere.
[03:10:17.755 --> 03:10:23.540]  But you can go on Google Earth and see these large strip mining operations and huge waste piles.
[03:10:23.540 --> 03:10:27.863]  I mean, it looks like small mountains, literally, of the phosphogypsum waste.
[03:10:29.045 --> 03:10:40.218]  And that's where this waste product, this industrial hazardous waste containing fluoride, is coming from, from these manufacturing plants.
[03:10:40.218 --> 03:10:42.360]  So we shouldn't say they're putting fluoride in our water.
[03:10:42.360 --> 03:10:43.782]  That's a cover term.
[03:10:43.782 --> 03:10:44.543]  That's bad enough.
[03:10:44.543 --> 03:10:46.265]  They're putting the toxic waste in our water.
[03:10:46.685 --> 03:10:47.425]  Right, right.
[03:10:47.425 --> 03:10:50.386]  I mean, this is not naturally occurring fluoride.
[03:10:50.386 --> 03:10:58.009]  This is an industrial toxic fluoride waste product from the phosphate fertilizer manufacturing sector.
[03:10:58.009 --> 03:11:07.893]  There's a few other industries where they generate some fluorides as well, from copper smelting and aluminum smelting and the steel industry.
[03:11:07.893 --> 03:11:11.254]  So there can be other sources of this fluoride as well.
[03:11:12.310 --> 03:11:13.510]  Amazing.
[03:11:13.510 --> 03:11:14.751]  What do we do about this?
[03:11:14.751 --> 03:11:16.591]  You guys did a tour there.
[03:11:16.591 --> 03:11:20.373]  We heard about it and kind of came in under your wing.
[03:11:20.373 --> 03:11:24.814]  We appreciate you guys contacting us and the work you're doing.
[03:11:24.814 --> 03:11:30.055]  If we just get more Austinites or more people listening in upstate New York or Chicago or California right now.
[03:11:30.055 --> 03:11:31.276]  We have listeners all over the country.
[03:11:31.276 --> 03:11:34.377]  We have over 80 affiliates, XM Radio listening right now.
[03:11:35.017 --> 03:11:37.299]  This is really toxic waste.
[03:11:37.299 --> 03:11:40.202]  You guys are fighting if more people would stand up.
[03:11:40.202 --> 03:11:42.865]  The majority of the EPA scientists I know signed letters.
[03:11:42.865 --> 03:11:45.788]  We've had their head on saying this is toxic waste.
[03:11:45.788 --> 03:11:47.530]  The government doesn't like this.
[03:11:47.530 --> 03:11:50.213]  The people that actually work in the government know it's bad.
[03:11:50.213 --> 03:11:51.574]  How do we end this?
[03:11:51.574 --> 03:11:58.381]  And then tell us about the tour and we'll get some comments from Ray Nadler Olnick.
[03:12:00.328 --> 03:12:04.113]  Ray has been speaking to the City Council, so she should talk about that.
[03:12:04.113 --> 03:12:06.315]  Yeah, tell us about solutions.
[03:12:06.315 --> 03:12:12.163]  Yes, actually, my idea came from you.
[03:12:12.163 --> 03:12:12.924]  Oh, really?
[03:12:12.924 --> 03:12:14.486]  You're spurring people to take it?
[03:12:14.486 --> 03:12:15.067]  I didn't know that.
[03:12:15.896 --> 03:12:22.361]  It partly came from Joyce Rowley, and it partly came earlier from circumstances, which we can go back to if you want.
[03:12:22.361 --> 03:12:26.403]  But basically, the idea of fluoride had entered my mind.
[03:12:26.403 --> 03:12:31.387]  I had heard you talking about it more and more on the radio, and I listened to you every day.
[03:12:31.387 --> 03:12:32.808]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[03:12:32.808 --> 03:12:34.389]  Yeah, faithfully.
[03:12:34.389 --> 03:12:38.332]  And one day last fall,
[03:12:39.494 --> 03:12:52.062]  A man called in from another state, I think it was Pennsylvania, he was not a Texan, and he said, I've been trying to wake the people up around me to fluoride and they just aren't listening to me.
[03:12:52.062 --> 03:12:54.783]  They dismiss it, they shrug it off, what should I do?
[03:12:54.783 --> 03:12:57.065]  And you said, among other things, you said,
[03:12:58.103 --> 03:12:59.104]  Get active.
[03:12:59.104 --> 03:13:00.905]  Go to City Hall.
[03:13:00.905 --> 03:13:05.368]  Become known as the guy who talks about fluoride every week.
[03:13:05.368 --> 03:13:14.275]  And you had other suggestions too, like start a radio program, advertise filters, water filters, as a way to fund yourself.
[03:13:14.275 --> 03:13:14.735]  Exactly.
[03:13:14.735 --> 03:13:16.736]  That way you're helping people and funding yourself.
[03:13:16.736 --> 03:13:17.377]  It's symbiotic.
[03:13:17.537 --> 03:13:18.997]  But it is.
[03:13:18.997 --> 03:13:22.398]  But what really struck me was, bingo, I can do that.
[03:13:22.398 --> 03:13:25.999]  I have the time flexibility to do that.
[03:13:25.999 --> 03:13:27.620]  And I studied.
[03:13:27.620 --> 03:13:30.621]  I was a total political virgin.
[03:13:30.621 --> 03:13:35.182]  I will have to say I have never lifted a finger in activism before, although I have given money.
[03:13:35.842 --> 03:13:39.405]  To all my favorite broadcasters, including you.
[03:13:39.405 --> 03:13:42.308]  But there you go, the 600 into the valley.
[03:13:42.308 --> 03:13:43.929]  Oh my gosh, yes.
[03:13:43.929 --> 03:13:52.097]  Yes, I studied it a little and I came to realize that they had the citizen communication at noon, when most people can't come.
[03:13:52.097 --> 03:13:54.139]  This is for communications.
[03:13:54.139 --> 03:13:57.202]  Yeah, it used to be at night, but now they've made it so hard.
[03:13:57.202 --> 03:13:58.843]  You've got to sign up a week before.
[03:13:58.843 --> 03:13:59.143]  Two weeks.
[03:13:59.944 --> 03:14:00.305]  Two weeks.
[03:14:00.305 --> 03:14:01.746]  Oh, now it'll actually be one year.
[03:14:01.746 --> 03:14:02.347]  It's two weeks.
[03:14:02.347 --> 03:14:03.348]  Twenty years, Bob.
[03:14:03.348 --> 03:14:04.189]  Right, exactly.
[03:14:04.189 --> 03:14:05.371]  They don't want to hear from you.
[03:14:05.371 --> 03:14:08.615]  I had been under the impression it was evenings, too.
[03:14:08.615 --> 03:14:10.237]  Well, I guess they keep changing it.
[03:14:10.237 --> 03:14:15.564]  Well, this is for items that are not on the, what do you call it, on the agenda.
[03:14:15.564 --> 03:14:16.945]  So what you do is scan the agenda.
[03:14:16.945 --> 03:14:18.668]  Anything on water-related, you can come in.
[03:14:19.864 --> 03:14:20.825]  You're right.
[03:14:20.825 --> 03:14:28.691]  And anything that's related to the environment.
[03:14:28.691 --> 03:14:34.976]  We have just started talking before the Environmental Board in a similar way.
[03:14:34.976 --> 03:14:39.759]  That suggestion came to me from Neil and also from Paul Robbins, who is a very
[03:14:40.720 --> 03:14:40.800]  I'm
[03:14:58.046 --> 03:15:03.611]  We're going to try to get that, and in fact, on this program, people who are interested will hear about it.
[03:15:03.611 --> 03:15:04.712]  And don't let them stop you.
[03:15:04.712 --> 03:15:11.317]  I mean, pretty soon they're just going to get rid of it altogether, but then you just go speak on items, you just go check each week what the agenda is.
[03:15:11.317 --> 03:15:21.206]  But go sign up, take your lunch off, take a bag lunch and eat it while you're driving down there, and go let these creatures know that you don't want this poison in the water.
[03:15:21.206 --> 03:15:23.168]  I mean, it's not our opinion.
[03:15:23.168 --> 03:15:24.429]  A fish can't live in it.
[03:15:25.239 --> 03:15:26.660]  I know that.
[03:15:26.660 --> 03:15:29.080]  I know you know, but the listeners, new listeners, don't know.
[03:15:29.080 --> 03:15:42.925]  Yeah, what we were told yesterday on the tour, as Ray saw, is that all the city has to do is turn the little tap off where the hydrofluoric acid is coming out, or hydrofluorosilicic acid, and so Ray might want to point that out too.
[03:15:42.925 --> 03:15:46.827]  I mean, that was quite amazing that the city said all they have to do is just turn it off and stop it.
[03:15:47.520 --> 03:15:54.803]  Well, there's laws against forced medication, and they say they're doing it for our teeth, and all the studies say it makes them fracture and gives you dental fluorosis.
[03:15:54.803 --> 03:16:01.126]  And now, the American Dental Association, as you know, two years ago began recommending children not brush their teeth with it!
[03:16:01.126 --> 03:16:06.988]  I mean, even the Dental Association says it's bad, but we can't get these bastards to take it out of our water!
[03:16:07.168 --> 03:16:16.512]  Well, they also said, the Centers for Disease Control and the American Dental Association, that fluoridated water should not be used to make up infant formula.
[03:16:16.512 --> 03:16:18.252]  But mothers haven't been warned.
[03:16:18.252 --> 03:16:20.093]  They didn't really make that widely public.
[03:16:20.093 --> 03:16:22.794]  Well, it's your activities and everybody else taking action.
[03:16:22.794 --> 03:16:24.495]  We're having victories here.
[03:16:24.495 --> 03:16:30.377]  But I'm going to shut up, because we've got a guest popping in with you on this same subject in the next segment, and we're going to keep you until 40 after.
[03:16:30.377 --> 03:16:33.219]  Gary Talis has been vindicated, 9-11 truther.
[03:16:33.219 --> 03:16:36.320]  I've been slandered by Fox News, but that's a separate issue at the end of the show.
[03:16:37.361 --> 03:16:40.127]  Tell us about what happened at this tour.
[03:16:40.127 --> 03:16:43.656]  My guys were there, but they had to turn their cameras off for national security.
[03:16:43.656 --> 03:16:46.522]  Tell us how you got in, what happened, how important this was.
[03:16:47.014 --> 03:16:58.837]  Well, a month ago I decided that it would be a good idea to request a tour from the city, so they agreed, and then I said that other people would like to join the tour.
[03:16:58.837 --> 03:17:09.420]  I thought it would be a great educational opportunity for people to see how the water purification plant works for the city, and where they're adding the fluoride, and to hear this straight from them.
[03:17:09.420 --> 03:17:12.641]  And so we toured most of the plant,
[03:17:13.141 --> 03:17:30.693]  And when we came to this containment building, where they have two hydrofluorosilicic acid storage tanks, several thousand gallons in size, that building, I mean, it's a containment building, so if there's a leak, everything is contained in there, but it's obvious the doors are labeled.
[03:17:31.153 --> 03:17:52.667]  That this is a highly toxic corrosive acidic material and they've got a shower in there in case you get exposed and you could see some signs of corrosion to some of the paint and materials where there's probably been some vapor leak because this is such a corrosive material in fact where the tanker truck comes in and unloads
[03:17:53.147 --> 03:17:55.668]  Well, I just want to point out that
[03:18:20.757 --> 03:18:26.523]  We drilled the well on our family property in East Texas into the Keachai level.
[03:18:26.523 --> 03:18:27.804]  That's 600 feet down.
[03:18:27.804 --> 03:18:29.466]  It's a little aquifer.
[03:18:29.466 --> 03:18:32.189]  And I have family that runs the local water district.
[03:18:32.189 --> 03:18:34.130]  They work there.
[03:18:34.130 --> 03:18:36.753]  And, you know, they're at the plant.
[03:18:36.753 --> 03:18:37.234]  It's actually my
[03:18:38.464 --> 03:18:41.205]  It's my uncle's wife's brother.
[03:18:41.205 --> 03:18:48.126]  But the point is, he said it's the purest, best water, aquifer water, and they make them add all these chemicals under federal law.
[03:18:48.126 --> 03:18:49.447]  He thought it was some mandate.
[03:18:49.447 --> 03:18:51.947]  But the issue is, Austin has great aquifer water.
[03:18:51.947 --> 03:18:56.348]  There's no reason to be doing any of this, adding chlorine, any of it.
[03:18:56.348 --> 03:18:57.869]  I mean, that's a whole other subject.
[03:18:57.869 --> 03:19:07.651]  I mean, if you've got aquifer water, and you're not drinking out of some toxic reservoir that's got sewage in it, like Dallas or something, why on earth would you put anything in the best water there is?
[03:19:09.076 --> 03:19:23.953]  Well, they definitely talked about the different treatment chemicals that they're adding, but our tour was more focused on the fluoride, but they went through the water treatment and purification process, the filtration process, so it was very interesting.
[03:19:23.953 --> 03:19:29.680]  I think we learned a great deal, but we could see from our own eyes that they're doing this fluoridation.
[03:19:30.140 --> 03:19:30.861]  Actively there.
[03:19:30.861 --> 03:19:34.163]  They're putting so many gallons in, you know, a day.
[03:19:34.163 --> 03:19:36.425]  And they have to keep buying this chemical product.
[03:19:36.425 --> 03:19:48.573]  But if people, you know, wanted this stopped by, you know, calling, emailing the mayor and the city council, going down to speak, the city could easily turn it off and probably save a million dollars a year.
[03:19:48.573 --> 03:19:48.993]  That's right.
[03:19:48.993 --> 03:19:49.794]  That's the other point.
[03:19:49.794 --> 03:19:50.895]  I've seen the studies.
[03:19:50.895 --> 03:19:54.557]  This is toxic waste these mining companies would have to pay to get rid of.
[03:19:54.557 --> 03:19:56.058]  Instead, they make us buy it.
[03:19:56.058 --> 03:19:56.959]  What schmucks.
[03:19:56.959 --> 03:19:57.319]  Stay there.
[03:19:57.319 --> 03:19:59.461]  Let's talk more about taking action against this when we get back.
[03:20:01.314 --> 03:20:11.903]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[03:20:11.903 --> 03:20:13.324]  Garden in a Can!

[03:20:31.916 --> 03:20:33.337]  Garden in a can.
[03:20:33.337 --> 03:20:34.537]  It's that simple.
[03:20:34.537 --> 03:20:35.237]  Fresh.
[03:20:35.237 --> 03:20:36.118]  Healthy.

[03:20:54.278 --> 03:20:54.959]  A new world order.
[03:20:54.959 --> 03:20:58.362]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:21:09.716 --> 03:21:12.558]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:21:12.558 --> 03:21:15.341]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:21:15.341 --> 03:21:18.524]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:21:18.524 --> 03:21:25.850]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:21:28.874 --> 03:21:34.318]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:21:34.318 --> 03:21:38.200]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:21:38.200 --> 03:21:40.742]  Bill Ferguson is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:21:40.742 --> 03:21:41.923]  Most people have no idea.
[03:21:41.923 --> 03:21:42.703]  They're not after money.
[03:21:42.703 --> 03:21:43.984]  They have all the money they need.
[03:21:43.984 --> 03:21:44.965]  They're after power.
[03:21:44.965 --> 03:21:46.106]  That's what they're after these days.

[03:21:54.811 --> 03:21:55.592]  In Game.
[03:21:55.592 --> 03:21:57.633]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:21:57.633 --> 03:21:58.694]  You have been warned.
[03:21:59.694 --> 03:22:06.356]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[03:22:06.356 --> 03:22:14.477]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[03:22:14.477 --> 03:22:22.639]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[03:22:22.639 --> 03:22:27.380]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:22:27.720 --> 03:22:32.942]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[03:22:32.942 --> 03:22:37.304]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[03:22:37.304 --> 03:22:38.385]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:22:38.385 --> 03:22:42.887]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[03:22:42.887 --> 03:22:47.789]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[03:22:47.789 --> 03:22:50.790]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[03:22:50.790 --> 03:22:52.431]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:55.612 --> 03:22:59.095]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:59.095 --> 03:23:02.197]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[03:23:02.197 --> 03:23:07.721]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[03:23:07.721 --> 03:23:13.425]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:23:13.425 --> 03:23:14.926]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:23:14.926 --> 03:23:23.813]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[03:23:24.233 --> 03:23:26.056]  Now compare a Kalben Pure Soap.
[03:23:26.056 --> 03:23:30.281]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[03:23:30.281 --> 03:23:35.307]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.

[03:23:52.797 --> 03:23:53.858]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[03:24:08.533 --> 03:24:09.315]  We're good to go.
[03:24:19.602 --> 03:24:22.445]  All right, we're going to come back to our guest in the next segment.
[03:24:22.445 --> 03:24:28.270]  And I didn't mean to have this guest on today when they were on, but it dovetails together perfectly.
[03:24:28.270 --> 03:24:30.852]  Tyler Palmer, for this quick segment.
[03:24:30.852 --> 03:24:37.118]  He's the developer and one of the owners of acolablue.com, atmospheric water generators.
[03:24:37.118 --> 03:24:38.659]  And I was telling my guest, hey, I've got a...
[03:24:39.480 --> 03:24:43.223]  In the middle of our interview, we have somebody on to talk about water filtration.
[03:24:43.223 --> 03:24:45.845]  And the doc was saying, well, you know, even filters only cut some of it out.
[03:24:45.845 --> 03:24:49.248]  And I said, no, this is atmospheric water generator.
[03:24:49.248 --> 03:24:55.312]  It's grabbing it out of the air, then putting it through reverse osmosis, carbon filters, you name it.
[03:24:55.312 --> 03:24:58.555]  But it is good to have Tyler Palmer on with us.
[03:24:58.555 --> 03:25:00.716]  Tyler, a perfect, perfect day to have you on.
[03:25:00.716 --> 03:25:05.360]  We're talking about forced fluoridation of the water supply with folks here in Austin.
[03:25:05.780 --> 03:25:10.504]  Yeah, Alex, it's a fascinating show and I'm glad to be here.
[03:25:10.504 --> 03:25:19.352]  It's correct that people would need very expensive ultrafiltration, if not reverse osmosis systems.
[03:25:19.352 --> 03:25:26.978]  The price is in $10,000 to $20,000 to be able to get fluoride out of the drinking water.
[03:25:26.978 --> 03:25:31.742]  Fortunately, we have our atmospheric water generator which condenses
[03:25:32.904 --> 03:25:37.533]  ...humidity in the air and filters the water and delivers...
[03:25:38.340 --> 03:25:38.900]  About it.
[03:25:38.900 --> 03:25:39.761]  Pure water.
[03:25:39.761 --> 03:25:41.341]  Yeah, well, yeah, I mean, absolutely.
[03:25:41.341 --> 03:25:43.022]  I have children, so I looked into this.
[03:25:43.022 --> 03:25:45.263]  And a big murky reduces it.
[03:25:45.263 --> 03:25:47.144]  Cuts a lot of it out.
[03:25:47.144 --> 03:25:49.965]  Of reverse osmosis, 90-something percent.
[03:25:49.965 --> 03:25:53.226]  Because fluoride's so little, it stays in the water.
[03:25:53.226 --> 03:25:55.027]  It's just perfect for this.
[03:25:55.027 --> 03:25:59.208]  But if it's out of the air, there is almost no fluoride in the air.
[03:25:59.208 --> 03:26:02.390]  There's some trace amounts because it's sprayed on lawns and blowing around.
[03:26:02.390 --> 03:26:05.411]  Explain that to people and tell folks about the Ecolablu system.
[03:26:06.072 --> 03:26:07.132]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:26:07.132 --> 03:26:19.377]  The molecular weight of fluorosilicic acid is about 144.08 atomic mass units, so it's actually very small.
[03:26:19.377 --> 03:26:21.398]  Most ultrafiltration systems
[03:26:22.285 --> 03:26:25.348]  Uh, cut off at about 1,000 AMU's.
[03:26:25.348 --> 03:26:27.649]  Yeah, the doc is nodding his head.
[03:26:27.649 --> 03:26:31.152]  Doc, you're, uh, you're, uh, you're saying, uh, that, uh, Tyler Palmer's right?
[03:26:31.152 --> 03:26:32.953]  Yes, on the molecular weight, yes.
[03:26:32.953 --> 03:26:35.195]  So it's very hard for regular filters to cut this out?
[03:26:35.195 --> 03:26:36.696]  It's a very small molecule.
[03:26:36.696 --> 03:26:38.117]  Yes.
[03:26:38.117 --> 03:26:47.244]  And it's so sneaky, it, it, it gets in, in places, it sticks to things, it, it's, uh, got a very low pH, uh, about, uh, 1.2, if not, uh,
[03:26:50.373 --> 03:26:52.974]  Lower, that's I think lower than stomach acid.
[03:26:52.974 --> 03:26:58.876]  So it's just not a very pleasant thing to have in your water and or to have to deal with.
[03:26:58.876 --> 03:27:06.878]  Yeah, the bottom line way to cut this out is the Ecolablue system and I can't think of a better time to be promoting this for listeners.
[03:27:06.878 --> 03:27:09.879]  The website is Ecolablue.com, we'll put it up on screen.
[03:27:18.044 --> 03:27:19.025]  Or 1-800-691-6043.
[03:27:19.025 --> 03:27:20.807]  1-800-691-6043.
[03:27:20.807 --> 03:27:26.452]  Tyler, the reason we've got you up today is because you've got a new special you're offering, folks.
[03:27:26.452 --> 03:27:28.033]  Tell them about what you're offering.
[03:27:28.033 --> 03:27:28.854]  That's right.
[03:27:28.854 --> 03:27:36.962]  We have sort of the, we call it the Emergency Hurricane and New World Order Preparedness Special.
[03:27:36.962 --> 03:27:37.962]  And for $1,351,
[03:27:41.158 --> 03:27:47.306]  You get a new Ecolo Blue Model 28, and those are the new machines, they have a very...
[03:27:47.947 --> 03:27:57.232]  Neat, redesigned LCD screen with a stainless steel lower storage tank with an additional UV light in that storage tank.
[03:27:57.232 --> 03:28:00.233]  And you get a 6.5 HP, 2,800 watt max watts rated electric governor for only $1.
[03:28:00.233 --> 03:28:00.893]  That's a $375 value.
[03:28:00.893 --> 03:28:03.034]  What does that do with the machine?
[03:28:03.034 --> 03:28:06.616]  Well, that will power the machine in the event that your power goes off.
[03:28:17.134 --> 03:28:30.676]  In an emergency, you can power the machine and it has surplus energy so that you can charge flashlights and, you know, run your refrigerator or something to that effect.
[03:28:30.676 --> 03:28:36.197]  Charge up your car, you know, whatever you need.
[03:28:36.197 --> 03:28:41.538]  So this is have your water off the grid and so how much off is this in this special?
[03:28:41.538 --> 03:28:44.359]  Looks like the biggest special you've ever offered off the regular price.
[03:28:44.707 --> 03:28:47.351]  Well, the price is the same.
[03:28:47.351 --> 03:28:53.462]  It's the regular price, but since we're selling a generator for $1, a $375 generator,
[03:28:57.665 --> 03:29:05.070]  That's the equivalent of basically below $1,000 for the 28.
[03:29:05.070 --> 03:29:09.133]  So we're talking 25% off or so, roughly.
[03:29:09.133 --> 03:29:10.434]  That's just an amazing deal.
[03:29:10.434 --> 03:29:11.995]  Acolablue.com.
[03:29:11.995 --> 03:29:13.255]  We give folks the toll-free number 800-691-6043.
[03:29:13.255 --> 03:29:15.177]  Folks, if you love your children especially,
[03:29:20.680 --> 03:29:26.523]  Start getting them water you can trust, and the one place you really know you can trust it from is the Cola Blue.
[03:29:26.523 --> 03:29:31.666]  ECOLOBLUE.COM or 1-800-691-6043.
[03:29:31.666 --> 03:29:33.588]  Tyler, how long does this special run?
[03:29:33.588 --> 03:29:38.550]  It runs until next Friday, the 26th, and the promo code is INFOWARS.
[03:29:39.691 --> 03:29:41.452]  Gotta say Infowars.
[03:29:41.452 --> 03:29:43.252]  Tyler, great hearing from you.
[03:29:43.252 --> 03:29:44.413]  800-691-6043.
[03:29:44.413 --> 03:29:46.693]  It's running for one week.
[03:29:46.693 --> 03:29:48.854]  Get your Ecolaboo today and your free generator.
[03:29:48.854 --> 03:29:51.715]  Or it's one dollar.
[03:29:51.715 --> 03:29:53.115]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.115 --> 03:29:55.636]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.636 --> 03:29:58.337]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.274 --> 03:30:07.136]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us and the Truth Movement for years.
[03:30:07.136 --> 03:30:08.436]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[03:30:08.436 --> 03:30:12.717]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[03:30:12.717 --> 03:30:14.578]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[03:30:14.578 --> 03:30:20.880]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[03:30:22.020 --> 03:30:24.882]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[03:30:24.882 --> 03:30:26.623]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[03:30:26.623 --> 03:30:31.346]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price, and their formula really works.
[03:30:31.346 --> 03:30:34.168]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[03:30:34.168 --> 03:30:40.412]  Try the NutriCafe, their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[03:30:40.412 --> 03:30:42.833]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[03:30:42.833 --> 03:30:45.315]  And take it from me, folks, it really does taste great.
[03:30:45.315 --> 03:30:47.396]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[03:30:47.396 --> 03:30:48.517]  Go to www.
[03:30:49.998 --> 03:30:53.079]  E-N-E-R-F-O-O-D dot com.
[03:30:53.079 --> 03:30:57.741]  That's W-W-W dot E-N-E-R-F-O-O-D dot com.
[03:30:57.741 --> 03:31:01.422]  Or just click on their banner on Infowars.com for special pricing.
[03:31:01.422 --> 03:31:06.624]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:31:06.624 --> 03:31:10.646]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:31:10.646 --> 03:31:16.228]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:31:16.548 --> 03:31:17.189]  It's true.
[03:31:17.189 --> 03:31:22.534]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:31:22.534 --> 03:31:28.840]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[03:31:28.840 --> 03:31:31.743]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[03:31:31.743 --> 03:31:36.267]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:31:36.267 --> 03:31:39.871]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[03:31:40.091 --> 03:31:45.835]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.

[03:32:01.527 --> 03:32:06.009]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[03:32:06.009 --> 03:32:08.570]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[03:32:08.570 --> 03:32:09.450]  He was devastated.
[03:32:09.450 --> 03:32:18.253]  But it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[03:32:18.253 --> 03:32:24.456]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[03:32:24.456 --> 03:32:27.137]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[03:32:27.137 --> 03:32:29.518]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[03:32:30.598 --> 03:32:30.878]  I don't know.
[03:32:53.357 --> 03:32:54.838]  ownmyself.com.
[03:32:54.838 --> 03:32:58.620]  It takes very little money, and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[03:32:58.620 --> 03:33:00.862]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[03:33:00.862 --> 03:33:19.833]  Coming up, I'm going to engage in a big news blitz, an acquittal in Laura Bush case, heckling case, United Press International.
[03:33:21.394 --> 03:33:28.877]  We'll talk about that coming up.
[03:33:28.877 --> 03:33:36.900]  But right now, going back to Dr. Neal Karman, anti-fluoride activist here in Austin, Texas, anti-fluoridation activist, and Ray Nadler Olnick.
[03:33:36.900 --> 03:33:43.402]  Okay, so we're fighting it here in Austin, it's the same thing all over the country, and you got all these environmentalists,
[03:33:44.042 --> 03:33:51.064]  Again, environmentalism has all this reasonable, smart stuff like, let's not poison the environment, let's not have pollution, let's not toxify ourselves.
[03:33:51.064 --> 03:33:57.266]  But it seems like the Austin City Council only wants to grab people's property for environmental preserves and later build skyscrapers on it.
[03:33:59.787 --> 03:34:03.971]  Want to be realtors like Kirk Watson is now, the big realtor here in town.
[03:34:03.971 --> 03:34:10.456]  This is a real environmental issue for the environment, the birds, the bees, the plants, human beings.
[03:34:10.456 --> 03:34:14.179]  So this is something affecting everybody with the fluoridation.
[03:34:14.179 --> 03:34:20.305]  And you were telling me, Doc, you guys saw where the fluoride, or what they call fluoride, this witch's brew was going in.
[03:34:21.350 --> 03:34:22.911]  Yes.
[03:34:22.911 --> 03:34:27.154]  They had one of the units, one of the storage tanks still had a small amount of fluoride in it.
[03:34:27.154 --> 03:34:31.077]  They were expecting another shipment very soon from Florida.
[03:34:31.077 --> 03:34:39.423]  And so the pump was actively pumping a small amount of fluoride, putting it into the water, mixing it there.
[03:34:39.423 --> 03:34:40.924]  They explained the whole process.
[03:34:40.924 --> 03:34:42.386]  Lovingly mixing it, though.
[03:34:42.386 --> 03:34:42.666]  Right.
[03:34:42.666 --> 03:34:45.168]  We got to see the whole thing.
[03:34:45.168 --> 03:34:48.470]  And so, I mean, the city is spending a lot of money a year.
[03:34:48.470 --> 03:34:49.831]  They just renewed the contract.
[03:34:50.819 --> 03:35:04.886]  Yes, the city had a contract of which I had the cover page but I didn't have the entire contract and I was getting information off of the cover page which gave some summaries.
[03:35:04.886 --> 03:35:17.712]  They had a contract that was set to run from March 08 through March 2010 with three optional one-year extensions and the amount of money
[03:35:19.013 --> 03:35:23.060]  That it was to cost was approximately $600,000 a year.
[03:35:23.060 --> 03:35:23.200]  Wow!
[03:35:23.200 --> 03:35:24.302]  Now, this past March, they suddenly
[03:35:33.638 --> 03:35:34.898]  Renewed that contract.
[03:35:34.898 --> 03:35:40.000]  They canceled that contract and issued a new one, which is apparently legal.
[03:35:40.000 --> 03:35:45.262]  There must be something written into the contract that allows that to happen.
[03:35:45.262 --> 03:35:52.564]  And in fact, I have now requested through Freedom of Information both contracts.
[03:35:52.564 --> 03:35:54.585]  We don't know if it's more or less.
[03:35:54.585 --> 03:35:55.305]  No, it's more.
[03:35:55.305 --> 03:35:56.925]  It's way more.
[03:35:56.925 --> 03:35:58.626]  What they did, they issued a new one
[03:35:59.574 --> 03:36:04.617]  For an amount of approximately $700,000 for... This one runs from 2009 to 2011.
[03:36:13.604 --> 03:36:15.725]  And is that $700,000 a year?
[03:36:15.725 --> 03:36:16.525]  A year.
[03:36:16.525 --> 03:36:25.748]  And then the three extensions that they're locked into, presumably, are $910,000 a year for the next three years.
[03:36:25.748 --> 03:36:27.268]  That would be starting in 2011.
[03:36:27.268 --> 03:36:32.950]  So we mean millions and millions of dollars, and they admit this is the toxic waste
[03:36:33.530 --> 03:36:43.355]  A fertilizer production, aluminum purification, and nuclear weapons production, and they would have to pay to put this in mine shafts in Utah or Nevada.
[03:36:43.355 --> 03:36:47.817]  Instead, they have us pay to drink it.
[03:36:47.817 --> 03:36:48.317]  Yes.
[03:36:48.317 --> 03:36:54.720]  You know it's not going to go down, and in fact, I subpoenaed some documents.
[03:36:54.720 --> 03:36:55.961]  Wow, you're really getting busy.
[03:36:56.181 --> 03:36:57.861]  I am getting busy.
[03:36:57.861 --> 03:37:00.982]  This is all new to me and I'm learning as I go.
[03:37:00.982 --> 03:37:12.885]  And the reason given for this by Lussier was that their own supplier, which is Mosaic, the actual manufacturer, had suddenly doubled their price.
[03:37:12.885 --> 03:37:14.926]  Just overnight, they doubled it.
[03:37:14.926 --> 03:37:20.627]  So Lussier was kindly going to pass on a little less of that cost.
[03:37:20.627 --> 03:37:22.268]  They wanted an increase in 37%.
[03:37:24.693 --> 03:37:31.157]  So everybody else is losing their jobs or taking pay cuts, the economy's imploding, and they're going, hey, we got some toxic waste!
[03:37:31.157 --> 03:37:34.179]  Hey, the suckers in Austin and every other city, we're doubling!
[03:37:34.179 --> 03:37:35.239]  And how about triple?
[03:37:35.239 --> 03:37:42.224]  How about we all sell our houses and become homeless and we'll pay $10 billion for the toxic waste?
[03:37:42.224 --> 03:37:53.871]  I mean, see, it's just like with the banks, how we're paying them $14.8 trillion of our money to go loot the world, and then we pay interest on the money that taxpayers are going to pay
[03:37:55.953 --> 03:37:59.737]  I mean, who comes up with these diabolical frauds?
[03:37:59.737 --> 03:38:02.480]  Well, and we don't even know the total cost of the program.
[03:38:02.480 --> 03:38:08.447]  That's just the chemical purchasing cost from the company in Florida for the toxic industrial fertilizer waste.
[03:38:08.447 --> 03:38:14.453]  But there's also, there's got to be some... The building, the storage, the shipping, the insurance, the... And so forth, yes.
[03:38:15.234 --> 03:38:16.975]  It has to be very expensive.
[03:38:16.975 --> 03:38:19.497]  I mean, we figure it's got to be over a million a year.
[03:38:19.497 --> 03:38:25.422]  This is some estimates we've seen from other cities around the country, where the cost of the chemical is maybe 50 to 60 percent.
[03:38:25.422 --> 03:38:31.547]  Then, these corrosive chemicals eat up your pumps and equipment, so pipes, so... They gotta have insurance policies.
[03:38:31.547 --> 03:38:32.508]  Right, right.
[03:38:32.508 --> 03:38:34.189]  And the workers have to be very careful.
[03:38:34.189 --> 03:38:43.236]  So, that was the reason why, recently, the city of Elgin, which is just northeast of Austin, on 290, voted not to continue fluoridation anymore.
[03:38:43.616 --> 03:38:46.757]  And so did Alamo Heights on the north side of San Antonio.
[03:38:46.757 --> 03:38:48.398]  Yeah, that's the point I was going to make.
[03:38:48.398 --> 03:38:52.340]  San Antonio anti-fluoride group has really been one of the biggest in the country.
[03:38:52.340 --> 03:38:54.621]  And in closing, we are having victories.
[03:38:54.621 --> 03:39:00.724]  We can affect change if people get involved and point out what a ridiculous fraud this is.
[03:39:01.164 --> 03:39:05.189]  Yeah, there's actually a list of over 212 U.S.
[03:39:05.189 --> 03:39:08.913]  cities that have now shot down fluoridation.
[03:39:08.913 --> 03:39:10.155]  Artificial water fluoridation.
[03:39:10.155 --> 03:39:13.558]  There is a lot of money on the other side.
[03:39:13.558 --> 03:39:17.223]  And that is really the sum and substance of it.
[03:39:17.223 --> 03:39:19.445]  And people are deep, deep in denial.
[03:39:20.660 --> 03:39:35.048]  For instance, the CDC who can advise against giving fluoride to infants and at the same time insist vehemently that it's one of the 10 greatest public health measures of the 20th century.
[03:39:35.708 --> 03:39:36.528]  That's what I was going to say.
[03:39:36.528 --> 03:39:40.310]  How can they say, don't give it to infants, it hurts their brains and bone development.
[03:39:40.310 --> 03:39:42.590]  That's admitted now, official government.
[03:39:42.590 --> 03:39:45.671]  But then when you go in the store, it's give fluoride to your kids.
[03:39:45.671 --> 03:39:49.313]  I mean, it's not just that they don't care and are making money.
[03:39:49.313 --> 03:39:50.853]  There's a very sick agenda here.
[03:39:50.853 --> 03:39:51.233]  Oh yeah.
[03:39:51.233 --> 03:39:53.254]  Because we know the neurological effects it has.
[03:39:53.254 --> 03:39:54.554]  That's a fact.
[03:39:54.554 --> 03:39:58.076]  And you know, they can make all the Dr. Strangeloves they want making fun of us.
[03:39:58.076 --> 03:40:03.758]  I have the reports from major universities, we've read them on air, where they knew, the University of Texas in the 30s,
[03:40:04.938 --> 03:40:07.900]  had studies on fluoride and its effects on the brain.
[03:40:07.900 --> 03:40:12.824]  And so, when you search them, some of the first you find is German studies and U.S.
[03:40:12.824 --> 03:40:14.085]  studies at the University of Texas.
[03:40:14.085 --> 03:40:17.267]  I don't know if you've seen those, Doc, but it's amazing.
[03:40:17.267 --> 03:40:30.216]  Right, well, it's because of fluoride compounds as a flux for smelting was very, very important to the war effort.
[03:40:30.216 --> 03:40:32.118]  Steel and aluminum and uranium
[03:40:32.698 --> 03:40:38.781]  All require large amounts of calcium fluoride or sodium fluoride in their process.
[03:40:38.781 --> 03:40:44.344]  And it's cost prohibitive to store it in toxic dumps, so make people drink it.
[03:40:44.344 --> 03:40:46.304]  And it makes them sit down and shut up.
[03:40:46.304 --> 03:40:49.926]  Well, they wind up producing a lot of fluoride waste products.
[03:40:49.926 --> 03:40:52.847]  And the workers were being harmed.
[03:40:52.847 --> 03:40:54.968]  Some of them were actually dying.
[03:40:54.968 --> 03:40:55.469]  Neighbors.
[03:40:55.469 --> 03:40:57.049]  So there were lawsuits being filed in the 1940s.
[03:40:57.049 --> 03:40:57.350]  Tennessee.
[03:40:58.450 --> 03:41:04.176]  The aluminum industry, the steel industry, and governmental agencies said, well, this is a problem.
[03:41:04.176 --> 03:41:06.438]  We've got to quash these lawsuits.
[03:41:06.438 --> 03:41:13.305]  Look, I want to have you both back in the next few months as this develops, and please continue your fight.
[03:41:13.305 --> 03:41:14.686]  Thank you for your help.
[03:41:14.686 --> 03:41:21.153]  Videotape your city council confrontations, because I'm going to make a film about the whole eugenics angle, as we have their documents.
[03:41:21.633 --> 03:41:23.193]  You know, why they're doing this.
[03:41:23.193 --> 03:41:25.154]  You wonder why the public's so passive.
[03:41:25.154 --> 03:41:31.135]  The drugs, the entertainment, the GMO foods, all of this is putting people in a very docile, docile state.
[03:41:31.135 --> 03:41:34.135]  And, Doctor, I want to thank you for joining us.
[03:41:34.135 --> 03:41:35.675]  Dr. Neil Carmen.
[03:41:35.675 --> 03:41:42.317]  And I want to thank Ray Nadler, Olnick, also anti-fluoridation activist, fluoridefreeaustin.com.
[03:41:42.317 --> 03:41:43.397]  Volunteers, get involved.
[03:41:43.397 --> 03:41:46.737]  There's anti-fluoride groups in every major city and in small towns.
[03:41:46.737 --> 03:41:50.298]  Just Google the name of your town or city, and if there isn't one in your city, do
[03:41:50.718 --> 03:41:50.918]  Okay.
[03:41:50.918 --> 03:41:51.559]  Thank you so much.
[03:42:16.630 --> 03:42:17.791]  We've got a real trooper here.
[03:42:17.791 --> 03:42:22.873]  I know Luke Hradowski isn't a liar, and the other We Are Changers I know personally aren't liars.
[03:42:22.873 --> 03:42:24.274]  They've always told me the truth.
[03:42:24.274 --> 03:42:34.959]  They're stand-up people that take death threats, harassment, police come up and arrest them saying their cameras are machine guns and that their backpacks are bombs and we know you're not terrorists, but we're going to say you are.
[03:42:34.959 --> 03:42:41.162]  I knew they're getting death threats, death threats to their family, and I knew that German Tallis goes, you know, that's his nickname.
[03:42:42.642 --> 03:42:43.202]  We're good.
[03:43:01.710 --> 03:43:12.413]  And it turns out a Republican fundraiser in New York construction, they said, comes over with his daughter in a wheelchair and starts bashing, you know, comes across the street with her, screaming, why are you hitting my daughter?
[03:43:12.413 --> 03:43:13.473]  Why are you hitting my daughter?
[03:43:13.473 --> 03:43:23.355]  And there were surveillance cameras, and the police wouldn't release them, and then said there was no tape, but that they saw Gary beating her savagely, and the Secret Service swore to it.
[03:43:23.355 --> 03:43:26.496]  But I believed Gary, and I believed Luke, and I believe the other witnesses.
[03:43:26.496 --> 03:43:27.736]  It was a total setup.
[03:43:27.736 --> 03:43:29.437]  Then we found out this father
[03:43:30.397 --> 03:43:30.557]  Is
[03:43:47.722 --> 03:43:52.403]  Yes, and she'd go, so, Sean Hannity, so they attacked you.
[03:43:52.403 --> 03:43:53.224]  Hold on.
[03:43:53.224 --> 03:43:53.804]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:43:53.804 --> 03:43:54.604]  Oh, that's what I say?
[03:43:54.604 --> 03:43:56.044]  Yeah, they did.
[03:43:56.044 --> 03:44:05.427]  And then Fox News and New York Post and all of this, and here's UPI today, acquittal in Laura Bush heckling case.
[03:44:05.427 --> 03:44:14.110]  A New York jury has acquitted a 24-year-old man accused of heckling Laura Bush, oh how dare you, and Jenna Bush, and assaulting a wheelchair-bound teenager and her family.
[03:44:14.890 --> 03:44:16.592]  Next they'll say Ahmed Dinegi did that.
[03:44:16.592 --> 03:44:18.894]  I mean, it's just made up CIA baloney.
[03:44:18.894 --> 03:44:23.439]  The New York Post reported Wednesday a Manhattan's criminal court jury acquitted Gary Tallis.
[03:44:23.439 --> 03:44:25.541]  Imagine, they said he was going to prison, felonies.
[03:44:25.541 --> 03:44:29.685]  But he stood up, he fought back, he said, I'm innocent.
[03:44:29.685 --> 03:44:31.527]  And it just goes on from there.
[03:44:31.527 --> 03:44:36.552]  So Gary, in the time we have, they threw the book at you, the Secret Service lied, the cops lied.
[03:44:37.355 --> 03:44:40.177]  But you said, look, I don't care what you threaten with me.
[03:44:40.177 --> 03:44:41.678]  I'm not plea bargaining.
[03:44:41.678 --> 03:44:42.638]  I didn't do this.
[03:44:42.638 --> 03:44:44.840]  I was assaulted by them.
[03:44:44.840 --> 03:44:46.721]  And I was recapping the story from a year ago.
[03:44:46.721 --> 03:44:47.281]  That's correct.
[03:44:47.281 --> 03:44:49.643]  He came over to you and was going, don't hit her!
[03:44:49.643 --> 03:44:50.343]  Don't hit her!
[03:44:50.343 --> 03:44:50.764]  Don't hit her!
[03:44:50.764 --> 03:44:52.325]  And started choking you and attacking.
[03:44:52.325 --> 03:44:53.806]  Why are you hurting the girl?
[03:44:53.806 --> 03:44:54.106]  Why?
[03:44:54.106 --> 03:44:57.648]  You know, I mean, we should do a reenactment of me with a wheelchair going, don't hurt her!
[03:44:57.648 --> 03:44:58.209]  Don't hurt her!
[03:44:58.209 --> 03:45:00.890]  I mean, you know, just they love using things like that.
[03:45:00.890 --> 03:45:01.711]  Describe what happened.
[03:45:02.760 --> 03:45:06.724]  Um, it was an adventure, that's all I could say.
[03:45:06.724 --> 03:45:09.106]  Basically, I was too strong for this whole style.
[03:45:09.106 --> 03:45:16.111]  They wanted to give me community service as a plea bargain for just saying, okay, I hit the girl, but I did not hit the dad.
[03:45:16.111 --> 03:45:18.353]  I'm just this pathetic weakling that attacks girls.
[03:45:18.353 --> 03:45:19.795]  I'm not credible.
[03:45:19.795 --> 03:45:20.855]  And that's what they wanted to do to me.
[03:45:20.855 --> 03:45:30.243]  But they were actually trying to give me a year in jail, and then they were trying to throw me this plea bargain just so I could say guilty that I hit a girl in the wheelchair, but I did not touch the 300-pound father.
[03:45:31.730 --> 03:45:36.273]  Okay, now describe what the 300-pound goblin did to you.
[03:45:36.273 --> 03:45:38.334]  Well, I was just at the George Bush event.
[03:45:38.334 --> 03:45:44.819]  This guy, you know, me being 145 pounds, he's too cowardly enough to face me face-to-face.
[03:45:44.819 --> 03:45:50.402]  He decides to ram his handicapped daughter into my side, into my back, while screaming.
[03:45:50.402 --> 03:45:54.085]  Look, he's hitting my daughter at the same time simultaneously started hitting me in the back of my head.
[03:45:54.785 --> 03:45:55.866]  Back off your phone a bit.
[03:45:55.866 --> 03:45:57.627]  You're overdriving.
[03:45:57.627 --> 03:45:58.628]  Describe the scene.
[03:45:58.628 --> 03:46:02.331]  You're there to heckle the Lord, Laura Bush.
[03:46:02.331 --> 03:46:07.254]  You're peacefully out there, outside, and the witnesses all told me the same thing.
[03:46:07.254 --> 03:46:12.618]  He comes across running and screaming, and then you try to get away, and he starts ramming you.
[03:46:12.618 --> 03:46:14.879]  Ramming you, screaming, don't attack her.
[03:46:14.879 --> 03:46:15.480]  That's accurate.
[03:46:16.118 --> 03:46:16.778]  Something like that.
[03:46:16.778 --> 03:46:19.039]  You hit me from the back and you screamed in the beginning.
[03:46:19.039 --> 03:46:20.460]  You tried to do it in a deceptive manner.
[03:46:20.460 --> 03:46:21.060]  You were hiding.
[03:46:21.060 --> 03:46:23.041]  Oh, so it was a snake attack, then he started screaming.
[03:46:23.041 --> 03:46:24.642]  Okay, I was going from memory.
[03:46:24.642 --> 03:46:25.983]  Alright, tell us about the snake attack.
[03:46:26.613 --> 03:46:32.756]  You need to sue Hannity at least until he apologizes and admits that was a fabrication on his show.
[03:46:32.756 --> 03:46:34.577]  But being a CIA commander, he probably won't.
[03:46:55.798 --> 03:47:01.563]  Um, probably, um, they may not go anywhere because the news, they basically, um, you know, they get away with stuff like that.
[03:47:01.563 --> 03:47:05.707]  They always, uh, um... They get away with it because people don't stand up to them.
[03:47:05.707 --> 03:47:06.228]  Exactly, exactly.
[03:47:06.228 --> 03:47:15.936]  Believe me, you start suing people and all... Look, they were trying to put you in prison saying, we all attack... They were on the news saying you were choking her and beating her and blood was shooting everywhere.
[03:47:15.936 --> 03:47:17.338]  I mean, just total lies!
[03:47:18.278 --> 03:47:25.781]  I mean, they'll say whatever, and people like believing things like this because it's extreme, and people, you know, they like looking for extreme things to believe.
[03:47:25.781 --> 03:47:28.541]  Who would imagine this guy was trying to set you up?
[03:47:28.541 --> 03:47:30.702]  That's actually pretty common, folks do stuff like that.
[03:47:30.702 --> 03:47:37.965]  You know, it's like all the cases of black kids or Jewish kids painting swastikas on their own dormitory and they get caught.
[03:47:37.965 --> 03:47:39.605]  I mean, it's basically the same thing.
[03:47:39.605 --> 03:47:45.027]  So he's ramming you with it, and going back from memory, didn't he start grabbing you himself or something?
[03:47:45.549 --> 03:47:47.811]  Well, he tried to initiate me to hit him first.
[03:47:47.811 --> 03:47:52.314]  He put his finger in my face, and I told him to get out of my face, because I knew what he was trying to do.
[03:47:52.314 --> 03:47:55.897]  He was trying to get me to hit him right in front of Secret Service, in front of the police.
[03:47:55.897 --> 03:48:03.043]  And I basically tried to notify an authority figure to let him know that this guy is trying to provoke something to prevent anything in the future.
[03:48:03.043 --> 03:48:10.829]  As I was about to do so, he coordinated the attack, and basically, that's when the whole adventure began with him.
[03:48:11.502 --> 03:48:17.885]  Okay, now, now, going from what I heard from Luke and others and you, the Secret Service and police, they went ahead and went along with the lie.
[03:48:17.885 --> 03:48:20.205]  How did you defeat them in court?
[03:48:20.205 --> 03:48:23.787]  Well, I mean, the prosecutor himself wasn't really the brightest person.
[03:48:23.787 --> 03:48:33.431]  He was a black man from Harvard that believed that his supervisor tried to use him as their new star, you know, take on this high-profile case.
[03:48:33.431 --> 03:48:36.552]  But every single witness he had basically built my case.
[03:48:36.552 --> 03:48:38.873]  I mean, one Secret Service guy said I did not resist arrest.
[03:48:40.194 --> 03:48:53.352]  Let's be clear then, let's be clear, because I was getting the second hand from Luke and Les, the Secret Service didn't lie, the New York cops lied.
[03:48:53.352 --> 03:48:54.854]  Okay, well that's good for the Secret Service then.
[03:48:55.620 --> 03:48:59.063]  Right, the Secret Service guy basically said that I did not resist arrest.
[03:48:59.063 --> 03:49:01.705]  Because he's not going to lose his job lying.
[03:49:01.705 --> 03:49:03.827]  Okay, that's good.
[03:49:03.827 --> 03:49:04.548]  Exactly.
[03:49:04.548 --> 03:49:07.610]  And basically the cop couldn't corroborate anything.
[03:49:07.610 --> 03:49:09.191]  Everything was just a big mess.
[03:49:09.191 --> 03:49:23.603]  The only thing this guy had was a wheelchair, a book with children's pictures on it, and basically Maureen herself, poor child coming in with a Girl Scout uniform, a little puppy, trying to basically
[03:49:24.524 --> 03:49:26.046]  They're calling it an acquittal.
[03:49:26.046 --> 03:49:27.067]  Were you found not guilty?
[03:49:27.067 --> 03:49:27.707]  How did this play out?
[03:49:44.491 --> 03:49:46.692]  Right, I was trying not guilty on those four charges.
[03:49:46.692 --> 03:49:47.873]  They tried to get me resistant.
[03:49:47.873 --> 03:49:49.374]  Yeah, well, see how they spin it?
[03:49:49.374 --> 03:49:55.718]  I mean, an acquittal is not guilty, but the average person doesn't know what that means.
[03:49:55.718 --> 03:49:58.659]  And he just said, not guilty, set up.
[03:49:58.659 --> 03:50:00.080]  Look, you need to sue this guy.
[03:50:00.080 --> 03:50:01.441]  You need to sue them all.
[03:50:01.441 --> 03:50:06.224]  Gary, they're going to continue to go around in corners with a wheelchair, jumping out at people.
[03:50:06.224 --> 03:50:06.944]  Ah, you hurt her!
[03:50:06.944 --> 03:50:12.367]  You know, and you're walking down the street with your family, and there's a guy waiting with a wheelchair around the corner.
[03:50:12.367 --> 03:50:13.568]  You need to go after this guy.
[03:50:14.228 --> 03:50:17.852]  So were they angry when you were found not guilty?
[03:50:28.920 --> 03:50:38.352]  Um, well the guy himself was trying to stand me down the whole time in the courtroom, trying to act like a tough guy, trying to intimidate my lawyer, stepping hard to him when he was asked to leave the stand.
[03:50:38.352 --> 03:50:41.716]  He attacked my daughter, Sean Hannity!
[03:50:41.716 --> 03:50:45.341]  Now tell him this, honey, say he hits you, alright?
[03:50:45.341 --> 03:50:46.842]  I'll give you more ice cream.
[03:50:47.998 --> 03:50:49.139]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[03:50:49.139 --> 03:50:49.879]  That's just how it was.
[03:50:49.879 --> 03:50:51.720]  He was sitting there, yawning the whole time.
[03:50:51.720 --> 03:50:59.603]  You know, looking very guilty, looking very... Well, I mean, tell me what this liar did when I get back.
[03:50:59.603 --> 03:51:00.623]  Hey, good news!
[03:51:00.623 --> 03:51:08.046]  Neocons defeated again.
[03:51:08.046 --> 03:51:09.607]  Aerial Spring.
[03:51:09.607 --> 03:51:10.847]  Chemtrails.
[03:51:10.847 --> 03:51:12.988]  The Modified Atmosphere.
[03:51:12.988 --> 03:51:14.689]  Heavy metals and pesticides.
[03:51:15.182 --> 03:51:19.764]  Carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[03:51:19.764 --> 03:51:22.865]  You have a choice to keep your body clean.

[03:52:02.088 --> 03:52:04.689]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[03:52:05.285 --> 03:52:08.127]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.127 --> 03:52:14.011]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.011 --> 03:52:20.496]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:20.496 --> 03:52:22.497]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:22.497 --> 03:52:24.959]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:24.959 --> 03:52:34.686]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[03:52:35.157 --> 03:52:38.120]  That's fascist.
[03:52:38.120 --> 03:52:39.801]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:39.801 --> 03:52:41.663]  It's about a one world government.
[03:52:41.663 --> 03:52:48.569]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:52:58.399 --> 03:52:59.600]  The people strike back.
[03:53:01.167 --> 03:53:08.372]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[03:53:08.372 --> 03:53:12.935]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[03:53:12.935 --> 03:53:18.559]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[03:53:18.559 --> 03:53:26.084]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[03:53:26.084 --> 03:53:30.967]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[03:53:31.447 --> 03:53:37.308]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:53:37.308 --> 03:53:43.089]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.

[03:54:02.296 --> 03:54:08.099]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:08.099 --> 03:54:11.841]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:54:11.841 --> 03:54:15.662]  Alright, German Taoist found not guilty of a jury by his peers.
[03:54:15.662 --> 03:54:22.466]  That's why I have mainstream news where the American Bar Association wants to abolish juries and the lawyers can really rob you.
[03:54:23.326 --> 03:54:25.908]  And, uh, in England they're getting rid of juries.
[03:54:25.908 --> 03:54:28.690]  I want to get to that at the very end of the show here in a moment.
[03:54:28.690 --> 03:54:32.133]  But I was just talking to Jason Vermas, who interviewed you first last night.
[03:54:32.133 --> 03:54:37.017]  Literally, she had a real puppy in a Girl Scout outfit?
[03:54:37.017 --> 03:54:43.983]  I mean, if you'd have heard this father with his daughter on Sean Hannity, it was so, with him whispering, going, tell them they hit you, alright?
[03:54:43.983 --> 03:54:46.224]  I mean, German, this is getting insane.
[03:54:46.224 --> 03:54:49.327]  You're saying it was a real puppy or a stuffed puppy on the stand?
[03:54:49.927 --> 03:54:51.568]  Oh, it's crazy.
[03:54:51.568 --> 03:54:59.072]  Well, the day before she took the stand, we were looking at a picture of her with the Girl Scout uniform holding a picture of Laura Bosch smiling.
[03:55:00.096 --> 03:55:01.577]  Well, my lawyer's assistant made a joke.
[03:55:01.577 --> 03:55:02.638]  She said, well, where's the puppy?
[03:55:02.638 --> 03:55:04.659]  The only thing that's really missing is the puppy.
[03:55:04.659 --> 03:55:05.820]  You know, this is disgusting.
[03:55:05.820 --> 03:55:12.905]  And the next day, she really comes in with the puppy, and she was actually talking about how puppies help her confidence.
[03:55:12.905 --> 03:55:17.188]  And the prosecutor was asking her questions, such as, what kind of, what other puppies do you have?
[03:55:17.188 --> 03:55:18.108]  You have a terrier, I believe.
[03:55:18.108 --> 03:55:19.209]  You like playing with your terrier, don't you?
[03:55:19.209 --> 03:55:26.213]  So they're like, are you against, well, I mean, I confront who the drugs are, how his second in command got caught shipping in heroin and cocaine.
[03:55:26.213 --> 03:55:27.955]  I confront him with the Reuters article.
[03:55:28.795 --> 03:55:35.943]  And he, this is in Police State 2 The Takeover, and he says, the baby got hurt, and he goes, baby!
[03:55:35.943 --> 03:55:39.106]  Trying to, and everybody's going, baby, in the audience.
[03:55:39.106 --> 03:55:43.670]  And they go, drugs hurt the babies, and that's like psych warfare.
[03:55:43.670 --> 03:55:47.895]  The baby, the puppy, German talus is evil!
[03:55:47.895 --> 03:55:50.678]  So the jury saw right through this bizarre behavior?
[03:55:51.338 --> 03:55:53.419]  I had my London Guardian article here.
[03:56:18.371 --> 03:56:27.594]  It's very upsetting to me, because I wanted to show it before the show ended, where they're ending juries in England, and they try to make you not take one.
[03:56:27.594 --> 03:56:33.515]  Here it is, court allows first juryless criminal trial, and then you actually read that they've had thousands.
[03:56:33.515 --> 03:56:40.017]  This is just one where the people tried to sue, demanding a criminal trial with juries, and they said no, and it's a secret trial.
[03:56:40.737 --> 03:56:44.720]  Court allows first jury-less criminal trial, London Guardian.
[03:56:44.720 --> 03:56:49.203]  So, for years they've been trying to force you not to take them, but this is one that was found in court.
[03:56:49.203 --> 03:56:58.089]  They say no more juries, so... Well, thank God you got your jury, and as the people stop trusting the government more and more, they're gonna try to get rid of juries, so we gotta fight for those.
[03:56:58.089 --> 03:57:03.432]  I know it's extreme, and I'm evil and probably a terrorist, because I believe we should be able to protest.
[03:57:03.432 --> 03:57:07.935]  The Army now says that's terrorism, and I believe in the First Amendment and juries.
[03:57:07.935 --> 03:57:09.536]  I mean, I'm so evil.
[03:57:09.536 --> 03:57:10.337]  Well, Mr. Tallis,
[03:57:11.177 --> 03:57:12.417]  WeAreChange.org.
[03:57:12.417 --> 03:57:14.658]  I'm just glad the listeners and everybody supported you.
[03:57:14.658 --> 03:57:16.838]  I'm glad your lawyer did a good job.
[03:57:16.838 --> 03:57:18.839]  Praise God for this victory.
[03:57:18.839 --> 03:57:21.039]  What happened when you defeated the Goblin?
[03:57:21.039 --> 03:57:24.080]  What did he do when he heard not guilty?
[03:57:24.080 --> 03:57:24.920]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[03:57:24.920 --> 03:57:27.960]  You've been a great help in this whole matter.
[03:57:27.960 --> 03:57:29.941]  I really don't know what he did.
[03:57:29.941 --> 03:57:36.982]  He left the courtroom after he was dismissed as a non-credible witness, and I guess
[03:57:37.791 --> 03:57:41.496]  Um, I guess he's probably, um, biting his nails.
[03:57:41.496 --> 03:57:46.382]  Well, we don't know he's doing that, but, uh, he certainly, he certainly lied about you.
[03:57:46.382 --> 03:57:47.323]  Certainly lied about you.
[03:57:47.323 --> 03:57:49.425]  Right, he definitely did.
[03:57:49.425 --> 03:57:56.995]  I really don't know what he's up to, but based upon the character that he is, that he would use his daughter as a weapon, I believe that he's not doing something productive right now.
[03:57:57.932 --> 03:58:01.715]  Well, he really has savaged you, and you need to demand a retraction from him.
[03:58:01.715 --> 03:58:12.703]  But you've been found not guilty in court, and Mr. Tallis, God bless you, and we're glad that you got out of this time their attempt to run a false flag attack.
[03:58:12.703 --> 03:58:18.888]  There you are exposing the false flag attack of 9-11, and this guy runs a false flag staged attack on you.
[03:58:18.888 --> 03:58:20.809]  Tried to frame you for that.
[03:58:20.809 --> 03:58:22.150]  Mr. Tallis, good hearing from you.
[03:58:22.150 --> 03:58:22.730]  God bless you.
[03:58:22.730 --> 03:58:23.171]  Have a good weekend.
[03:58:23.171 --> 03:58:23.731]  God bless.
[03:58:23.731 --> 03:58:24.552]  God bless, Alex.
[03:58:24.552 --> 03:58:26.113]  You're doing a great job.
[03:58:26.113 --> 03:58:26.713]  You too, my friend.
[03:58:28.404 --> 03:58:30.366]  We'll be back right now in retransmission.
[03:58:30.366 --> 03:58:33.770]  OnePlaceInfoWars.com and the free podcast at InfoWars.com.
