[00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.200]  Take Alex Jones. You don't have to agree with everything Alex Jones says. I like Alex Jones,
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.320]  but I don't agree with everything Alex Jones says, and you don't have to. But Bill Maher,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.240]  famously, and credit to him, said when Alex Jones got banned, he said we shouldn't be banning
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.680]  people. He said, I hate Alex Jones, but Alex Jones should be allowed to talk. Everyone should
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.280]  be allowed to talk in the town square. Alex Jones, who is not my friend and who tells crazy lies
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:29.520]  about me, is thrown off Twitter, I think, and Facebook and a few other platforms. I think he's
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.240]  gonna- Thank God! That's Senator Tilleran, thank God. If you're a liberal, you're supposed to be
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.520]  for free speech. That's free speech for the speech you hate. That's what free speech means. We're
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.840]  losing the thread of the concepts that are important to this country. If you care about
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.120]  the real American s**t, or you don't. And if you do, it goes for every side. I don't like Alex
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:00.800]  Jones, but Alex Jones gets to speak. Everybody gets to speak. That's where we all need to be.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.880]  Reactions really incredible there. Yeah. Cheering for him being banned and not a single clap for
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.040]  him saying free speech should be protected. Correct. Correct. I think they kind of felt,
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.680]  maybe, hopefully, they were a little ashamed of themselves going, oh yeah, crap, you're right.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:23.360]  But look at the automatic response. Yeah! We shut him down! I feel like when they got Alex Jones,
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.840]  there was no safety net. He is a warrior, and he continued fighting, and now he's back in the
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.120]  mainstream. Good for him. But he was renegaded to his own site with his own servers, streaming every
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.520]  day to small audiences after they asked him off YouTube. No one defended him. No one. I was on
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.080]  vacation that day. I was fishing out of the country, and the company that I worked for,
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.520]  supposedly in favor of free speech, said not one word in his defense. And it's like, first,
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.480]  they came for Alex Jones. That's totally right. Yeah. It's the old adage. What did you think of
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.040]  Alex Jones? Loved him to death. I still talk to him to this day. I think that he's great. And
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.600]  I think that many more people should have been vocal when he was initially banned. I agree.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.560]  Because I was actually there. I was on a fishing trip that day. Yeah. I was in Labrador,
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.560]  and I've regretted it ever since, that I didn't come out of the box. I wasn't there.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.040]  I was off the air. But I completely agree. It was not even about Alex Jones. It's about,
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.080]  you can't censor people, period. Exactly. And Tucker, I remember the exact day when he got
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.640]  censored. I woke up, and I looked on my phone, and it said, Alex Jones, banned from YouTube,
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.800]  Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. He was banned everywhere. It was a mass banning,
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.560]  mass censorship effort to silence him. And again, I really didn't have an introduction into politics,
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.800]  but I had learned a lot of things from Alex Jones up front. And everything that he was telling me
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.880]  was not false. The people who condemn him and say that he's a crazy conspiracy theorist do not
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.560]  listen to his show every single day. Because I worked for him for two and a half years. I didn't
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.000]  know the three branches of government when I started. Now I can tell you international policy
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.240]  and what's going on all over the world right now, because I have listened to Alex. And he's talked
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.480]  about the government corruption historically that we've been through, all of the different
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.880]  operations, such as Operation Mockingbird, Operation Paperclip, a lot of these things.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.160]  The Tuskegee experiment, which is why the black community is so apprehensive for vaccinations in
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.240]  the modern day. He talks about a lot of these things. And our government doesn't like that.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.680]  Our government doesn't like being exposed. They don't like people who are willing to tell the
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.280]  truth and people who are willing to push back against the narrative. Look at the fact that
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.800]  the DHS just updated their bulletin to say, hey, if you're spreading distrust in the government,
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.480]  that could be considered terrorism. I don't think so. But I just I couldn't, of course,
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.560]  agree with you more. But I just I'm fascinated by the hate for Alex Jones. I'm not a daily Alex
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.760]  Jones viewer. I don't view anything regularly, actually. But I think Alex Jones seems really
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.000]  talented. He's smart. He's funny as hell. Truly funny. He's a lot more talent than I am in a lot
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.440]  of ways. That's my takeaway from Alex Jones. But why is he such a threat? Like, why would you hate
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.280]  Alex Jones? I've never understood that because he's telling the truth, Tucker. And again,
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.000]  I know Alex personally, and I've met a lot of people in this industry. And one of my biggest
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.920]  takeaways is that there are a lot of people, especially in conservative media, that are in
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.760]  this for money and fame. They don't actually care about this country and they don't actually care
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.520]  about America. They're scared about being censored. They're scared about hurting the
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.200]  wrong people's feelings, not getting the proper endorsement. Alex doesn't care about any of that.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.840]  Alex cares about the truth. He has since day one. He has made mistakes, for sure. But he comes out.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.240]  He apologizes for it. He corrects the record, which is something that many people in our media
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.680]  refuse to do. So the people who hate Alex Jones hate him because he is everything that they wish
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.480]  that they could be. Somebody who is willing to tell the truth, willing to fight for this country,
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.480]  and actually cares about humanity, not just America, but humanity as a whole.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.400]  Now, thanks to people like Alex Jones, who took the initial brunt of the weapon,
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.720]  the cancellation weapon, now there are lots of different platforms, lots of different apps,
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.280]  lots of different applications. I mean, Elon's taken over Twitter.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:32.000]  Same CBD oil for 30% more, because that's who we're getting it from. Made right here in Central
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.920]  Texas. Our private label name is Rebel Zen. Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.320]  or four CBD makers in the country. It's based right here in Texas, and we're giving it to you
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.360]  at 30% off. And here's what's even crazier. 30% off of what they're selling it for. They're selling
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.320]  theirs for 30% off what their competitors are. So this is the highest rated, already the lowest
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.520]  price, not even a lower price. Rebel Zen. Get yours at InfoWarsStore.com now.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:12.800]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:20.000]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.640]  which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.200]  Trans-dimensionally, over the space-time continuance, or full space.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.480]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing. What we envisioned
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:42.960]  100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality. While the society unravels, men run around
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.640]  totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:52.560]  women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:59.360]  to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling. InfoWars. Tomorrow's news today.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.320]  We interrupt this broadcast with a special report from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:11.600]  If I could, I'd make a deal with God, and I'd get him to swap out to me.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.480]  Attempts have been made to neutralize the InfoWarrior known as Alex Jones.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.120]  Countless attacks have been witnessed and reported in an effort to bring him down.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.040]  Alex Jones has been sighted on the battlefield fighting against the forces of evil.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.960]  We're not going to go down and just shut our mouths and just put up with this.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.960]  We know where the bodies are buried, folks, and one way or another, we're going to stay on here.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.760]  We're receiving reports that Alex Jones has broken through the front lines and is now heading
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:49.360]  toward the broadcast studio. All efforts to silence him have failed. Emerging victorious against the
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:55.280]  New World Order, here's your host, Alex Jones. Find the InfoWars transmission at InfoWars.com
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.920]  forward slash show. If you're receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:09.760]  It's Wednesday, August 9th, 2023. I'm coming to you from Debenharta, Texas, Austin,
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:15.440]  from the InfoWars News Center. We have an incredible transmission lined up today,
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:22.560]  the firebrand exposing the COVID emergency and hoax. Chris Skye in studio, third hour,
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.000]  hosting fourth hour. I'll be here for at least three hours.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:33.040]  We're going to open the phones up today and cover the waterfront of news. All right.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.960]  Where should we begin? Where should we start?
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.640]  Maybe first with this shirt I got given a couple of years ago, and I was too fat to wear it then.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:51.360]  I've lost about 25 pounds, still a little too big, but I'm able to wear it. I wonder what the
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:58.560]  message this shirt sends to the establishment. I wonder who gave me this shirt. I wonder who gave
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.280]  me this shirt in the New York Police Department. And they told me, oh, go ahead and wear it. We
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.680]  don't care. We want them to know that we're not with the system. Very high-ranking individual
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:14.640]  gave me the New York SWAT team shirt and just a little message to the New World Order. We're
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.360]  just going to leave it at that, that you don't control the people you think control the American
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.400]  people. We're not criminals. We're trying to save the country. And most of the military and police
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.680]  know that. They're not our saviors. I'm not their savior. But together with God working through us,
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.320]  we can save ourselves working together. Black, white, Hispanic, old, young, Asian,
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.240]  gay, straight. As long as you don't target children, we are all on the same team at the
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.080]  end of the day. But I got to tell you, the devil's very real. And I would get close to God, folks,
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.360]  not judging people. I'm just saying. All right. I was sitting here looking at all this incredible
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.880]  news we're going to cover. And I was thinking, what's the most important thing I can say when
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:10:06.080]  I start the show? And it's this. We are veterans, all of us now, of biological warfare attack.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.560]  We are veterans of psychological warfare attack. Pentagon admits it.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:19.520]  We are veterans of radiological and electromagnetic attacks with the 5G and the rest of the spectrum.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.360]  We are really victims of this, but we're going to be overcomers. But if you're under attack and
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.360]  don't know it, you're going to lose the war. What does G.I. Joe say? Knowing is half the battle.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.840]  So we're under attack with the open borders and the human smuggling and the fentanyl
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.480]  and the devaluation of the dollar and the attack on the family and the attack on children,
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.480]  sterilizing them and 20 plus percent of the public on serotonin reuptake inhibitor,
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.400]  antipsychotics and antidepressants eating people's brains and livers.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:57.040]  We are under total absolute assault. And it doesn't matter who you are. You could be a police
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:03.360]  officer. You could be a schoolteacher. You could be a trash collector. You could be a politician.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:09.840]  You could be a musician. You could be a nurse. The new world order is coming after you. And you
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:15.040]  can pretend it's not when your son has a heart attack and can't ever play basketball again.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:21.840]  Bronnie James and that college made them take it. You can pretend this isn't affecting you.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.960]  You can pretend the exploding crime and the inflation isn't affecting you. You can pretend
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:31.280]  the war in Ukraine isn't affecting you. But it is. You can pretend the hundreds of millions
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.120]  that are on the verge of starvation, more than 65 million extra that have starved to death,
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.760]  the U.N. estimates, and they ran the program to do it the last three and a half years with the
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.560]  lockdowns and the rest of it. But that collapse of the third world will then be used to flood the
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:50.560]  first world. We've got a lot of news on that front. So you can pretend that you're not under
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.480]  attack. You can pretend everything's fine. You can pretend that the only universe that exists
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:00.960]  is Netflix. But at the end of the day, you will be impoverished if you're lucky and killed in most
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:07.040]  cases. And you can play along with the system and think if you submit to their global social score
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:13.040]  and their ESGs and their cashless society that you're somehow opting in so you'll be passed over
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:19.120]  by the system. You'll be left alone when it's you, historically, that lowered the drawbridge
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:26.000]  to tyranny that the tyrants will eat first. And here's a great example of the war against
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.360]  humanity right here in front of me. Rand Paul escalates fraud criminal referral.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.600]  It's an Infowars.com article, and it's got his official letter and him on TV talking about it.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:46.400]  And it's a good headline, but I would have just said Justice Department stonewalls Senator Paul's
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:55.360]  call for criminal charges against Fauci. Fauci ran conferences called in support of
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:00.720]  gain of function, close quote. He's in the emails telling the top scientists in the U.S.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.080]  and Europe, let's cover this up and tell them it didn't come out of the lab and cover up that we
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:09.760]  made it. He's on record producing the vaccine before they even released it, the so-called
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:16.800]  vaccine. He's on record then lying to Congress and saying that they don't even know what gain
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:23.440]  of function is and that Senator Paul is wrong and that it's not happening. He's caught dead
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.840]  to rights, not lying like they said Roger Stone did in Congress, which he didn't
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:34.480]  saying he'd never talk to Julian Assange, which he hadn't. Julian Assange was all over TV. Then
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.840]  we were trying to get him. I tried to get Roger to get him. He said, well, I talked to this guy,
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.240]  Credico, that knows he maybe he'll come on prison sentence for that.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.560]  So he lied to Congress. He was in contact with him with no email, no witnesses,
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:54.160]  nothing. Assange said I never talked to Roger Stone. How does it affect us if Roger did lie
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.280]  to Congress about that, which I can tell you dead to rights. I was there. He did.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.440]  Where's the crime? Where's the victim? Where's the person that's hurt? But in the case of Joe
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.720]  Biden and Obama and the globalists and all the things they've done in this country,
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:13.520]  just the human smuggling alone that they've authorized and green lit, it's just staggering.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.960]  And what have they done since then? Well, Obama, that's who runs the administration,
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.840]  the third administration of Obama, the placeholders, Biden, didn't just continue
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:31.840]  the funding to the EcoHealth Alliance and the Wuhan lab in Wuhan, China. He increased the funding.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:38.960]  So he's continuing the illegal research that was moved in 2015 when it became a big national issue
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:44.240]  because scientists went public all over the news then that Fauci was weaponizing SARS
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.840]  into COVID viruses and that it was completely illegal.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:15:00.960]  And then he gets up before Congress and says he knows nothing about it. Zero, zero, zero, zero.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:07.360]  When he is on C-SPAN in 2017, 18 and 19, we played the clips at nauseam
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:14.880]  saying we're creating a function. There'll be a new virus out of China. We used a blow up. That's
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:24.320]  a quote. The global regulatory systems based on our FDA, including here, where it takes years
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:31.280]  to approve a drug or vaccine. So the big story here is they're making more bioweapons, they're
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:38.400]  making bioweapons in Ukraine. They now admit they are. And the Justice Department won't even respond
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:43.840]  to Senator Paul because they're a captured group at the top of complete criminals endangering all
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:51.040]  of our lives, including their own lives. Again, morons, crazy people, no common sense, a bunch
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:56.080]  of yes men and women, a plague on our country. They've made themselves the enemy of humanity
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.560]  and of themselves. No self-preservation.

[00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:27.810]  Holy Diver, you've been down too long in the Midnight Sea
[00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:30.810]  Oh, what's becoming of me?
[00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:38.810]  Holy Diver, you've been down too long in the Midnight Sea
[00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:41.810]  Oh, what's becoming of me?
[00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:43.810]  Ride the tiger!
[00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:48.810]  Ride the tiger, you can see his stripes but you know he's clean
[00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:52.810]  Oh, don't you see what I mean?
[00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.810]  Gotta get away
[00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.810]  Holy Diver
[00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:01.810]  Gotta get away
[00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:04.810]  Yeah
[00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.810]  Got shiny diamonds
[00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:12.810]  Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
[00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:16.810]  Something's coming for you
[00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.810]  For the morning
[00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:23.810]  You can hide in the sun till you see the light
[00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:26.810]  Oh, we will praise the rain
[00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:30.810]  Gotta get away
[00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:32.810]  Get away
[00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:37.810]  Between the velvet lies
[00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:43.810]  There's a truth as hard as steel
[00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:48.810]  The vision never dies
[00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.810]  Life's a never ending wheel
[00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:55.810]  Jump, jump
[00:21:55.810 --> 00:22:00.810]  Holy Diver, you're the star of the masquerade
[00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:03.810]  No need to look so afraid
[00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:05.810]  Jump, jump
[00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:07.810]  Jump on the tiger
[00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:10.810]  You can feel his heart but you know he's mean
[00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:13.810]  Some light can never be seen
[00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:16.810]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, let's get right to the big news
[00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:19.810]  So, we have
[00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:27.810]  This incredibly corrupt, evil, wicked, child-trafficking demon force
[00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:31.810]  Who knows we're awake to them
[00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:34.810]  They know their system is exposed
[00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:39.810]  Their engine of spiritual power is the destruction of children and their innocence
[00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:43.810]  Desperately trying anything they can now
[00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:45.810]  To convince us that we're the criminals
[00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:47.810]  Here's an incredible example from last week
[00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:50.810]  I got so busy, never even covered it, should have
[00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:52.810]  I guess it broke Friday
[00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:56.810]  The Sound of Freedom
[00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:59.810]  Thousands of donors helped make the movie
[00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.810]  One man gave
[00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:05.810]  $500
[00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:09.810]  And then his girlfriend, who had a kid with a man
[00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:11.810]  Reportedly took her child
[00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:13.810]  That happens all the time in custody battles
[00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.810]  Most of the Amber Alerts you see is
[00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:17.810]  When some mom or dad runs off with a kid
[00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:20.810]  They get him for two days and then they run to another state
[00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.810]  There's Amber Alerts and the rest of it
[00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:25.810]  And they ran the headlines, ABC News, CNN
[00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:29.810]  Major Sound of Freedom donor
[00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.810]  Major producer
[00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:35.810]  Charged with child trafficking
[00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:39.810]  Thousands of donors, small donation
[00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:43.810]  Had on his Facebook that he'd made a donation years ago
[00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:45.810]  To the film that was made in 2017
[00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:47.810]  And suppressed for five years
[00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:51.810]  And if you read all those articles, they never said
[00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:53.810]  That it was $500
[00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:55.810]  They never said that they had thousands of donors
[00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:57.810]  They never said he didn't grab a kid off the street
[00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:59.810]  They didn't know
[00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:03.810]  It was his girlfriend grabbing her child
[00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:05.810]  And we're not defending what happened
[00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:07.810]  We don't know the full story
[00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:09.810]  That's how fake news works, folks
[00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:11.810]  Just like they did to me
[00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:13.810]  Two and a half, three years ago
[00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:15.810]  We get subpoenaed
[00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:17.810]  We give them everything in these kangaroo cases
[00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:19.810]  The judges still defaulted
[00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:21.810]  As they said we were guilty and told juries we were guilty
[00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:23.810]  Unprecedented, that's the new model
[00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:25.810]  Now it's happening to thousands of people
[00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:27.810]  Not just me, I was the test case
[00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:31.810]  And so we hand over hundreds of thousands of emails
[00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:33.810]  With the keyword searches, unopened emails
[00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:35.810]  The judge ordered us to give them
[00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:37.810]  And they scan it and find a hidden link
[00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:39.810]  To child porn
[00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:41.810]  In an email we never opened
[00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:43.810]  And there's national headlines
[00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:45.810]  Alex Jones sent child porn
[00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:47.810]  To Sandy Hook Families, ABC News
[00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:49.810]  Associated Press
[00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:51.810]  I have people walking to me on the street
[00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:53.810]  And say, you ought to be in prison
[00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:55.810]  For that child porn
[00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:57.810]  And I just laugh at them
[00:24:57.810 --> 00:24:59.810]  I go, hey, that's you and the Democratic Party, that ain't me
[00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:01.810]  You got the wrong guy
[00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:03.810]  Not into kids
[00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:05.810]  I like the young women
[00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:07.810]  I like the full board
[00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:09.810]  On fire
[00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:11.810]  Peak out
[00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:13.810]  Prime women
[00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:15.810]  Like my wife
[00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:17.810]  I'm 49, she's 44
[00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:19.810]  That's right
[00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.810]  Way better than women in college
[00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:23.810]  Let me tell you
[00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:25.810]  They're in their prime
[00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:27.810]  So you got me wrong
[00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:29.810]  They got a name for it
[00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:31.810]  Not gonna with a family show say it
[00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:33.810]  M-I-L
[00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:35.810]  Another word
[00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:37.810]  But the point is the FBI gave us a letter
[00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:39.810]  Which they rarely do
[00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.810]  And said no, Jones is the victim of this
[00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:43.810]  He was sent unopened child porn
[00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:45.810]  But they didn't care
[00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:47.810]  They wrote that lie around the world
[00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:49.810]  Folks
[00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:53.810]  They wrote that lie around the world
[00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:55.810]  It's the left that wants a little intimidated
[00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:57.810]  Scared child to feel powerful over
[00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:59.810]  That they rape and they beat up
[00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:01.810]  No, no, no, that's not me
[00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:03.810]  I want the woman where it's intimidating
[00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:05.810]  Where they're on fire
[00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:07.810]  And they're like a goddess
[00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:09.810]  And they're amazing
[00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:11.810]  Because I'm powerful too
[00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:13.810]  I want to interface with something that's like me
[00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:15.810]  Full of life and mature
[00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:17.810]  And that wants to be with me
[00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:19.810]  And I'm not a masochist or a sadomasochist
[00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:21.810]  I like one thing
[00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:23.810]  And that's pleasure
[00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:25.810]  Not power over somebody
[00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:27.810]  I'm not like you
[00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:29.810]  And John Podesta
[00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:31.810]  And Tony Podesta
[00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:33.810]  And all the sick evil they're into
[00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:35.810]  Those monsters
[00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:37.810]  Because what woman wants them
[00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:39.810]  Oh they would go for the big powerful
[00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:41.810]  Beautiful bombshell
[00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:43.810]  Carmen Electra types in her peak
[00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:45.810]  That's kind of my type
[00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:47.810]  But those people are disgusted
[00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:49.810]  By Harvey Weinstein
[00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:51.810]  And the rest of it
[00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.810]  So instead they want power
[00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:55.810]  Over little children
[00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:58.810]  But the reason I raise that point is
[00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:00.810]  That's who they are
[00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:11.330]  And that's who the media is to say that Sound of Freedom, because one of thousands of donors
[00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:21.090]  to make the movie that changed the world, girlfriend is the ex-wife of a man and didn't
[00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:24.590]  want to bring her kid back at the end of the weekend.
[00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:28.889]  And that turns into Sound of Freedom is produced and run by child traffickers.
[00:27:28.889 --> 00:27:32.290]  You see how they build on a kernel of truth.
[00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:37.310]  And I know you as an audience of activists get that, but everything these monsters do
[00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:38.310]  is similar to that.
[00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:44.050]  And I want to come back in a longer segment and get into Trump because, man, he's been
[00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:49.149]  in Fuego, in Fuego, in Fuego, in Fuego, in Fuego to the 10th power, just coming right
[00:27:49.149 --> 00:27:50.149]  out of there.
[00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:51.149]  Oh, we're going to censor you.
[00:27:51.149 --> 00:27:52.149]  We're going to gag you.
[00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:53.149]  How dare you say this is political?
[00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:54.570]  How dare you say it's election meddling?
[00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:55.570]  How dare you?
[00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:56.770]  How dare you say we're criminals?
[00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:57.990]  They've indicted him.
[00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:59.389]  They're saying he's a criminal.
[00:27:59.389 --> 00:28:02.310]  They're saying he's going to prison for 500 and something years.
[00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:07.110]  And he simply says, I'm not backing down to you crooks, and this will be overturned by
[00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:10.909]  the Supreme Court, and I can't even be on the campaign trail because you plan to have
[00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:21.270]  me tied down in all of these trials in the next year and a half that is bonafide, pure
[00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:22.270]  election meddling.
[00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:25.070]  And they go, you're intimidating people.
[00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:29.110]  Don't say the truth.
[00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:35.389]  And it's the same thing over and over and over again.
[00:28:35.389 --> 00:28:40.030]  We'll play some of those clips when we come back, but they've really bit off way more
[00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:47.469]  than they can chew, my friends, and it's one hell of a time to be alive.

[00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:17.710]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:22.710]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.

[00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:28.710]  That's how our bodies work.
[00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:29.710]  They're all very diverse.

[00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:07.710]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:30.480]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well so
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:36.120]  does he. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:44.040]  I want to thank the listeners, because I want you to know how thankful I am and how important
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:48.920]  you are for keeping us in the fight. You are the gravity, you are the fuel, you are the
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:54.160]  engine, you are the mind, the eyes, the ears, the soul of our resistance. You hold us in
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:34:00.840]  the sky as a light of liberty and freedom of the world. You are the arms and the legs
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:06.680]  and the chest and the back and the neck and the head thrust up that torch of liberty.
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:13.640]  You hold us high and I salute you and thank you from the bottom of my heart and only ask
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:21.760]  you to keep us in the fight now more than ever. Alright, let's get into Trump. An imperfect
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:27.840]  vessel as we all are, but the enemy is after him, it's 100% real and he has incredible
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:35.000]  courage and we know he will devastate them if he gets back in. I really believe and I
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.840]  know because Rogers talked to him quite a bit that Trump's fatalist about this, fired
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:46.080]  up and is on a kamikaze run like Luke Skywalker doing the trench run in episode 4. He's going
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:50.480]  to carry out the mission no matter what happens and there's nothing more satisfying as a man,
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:54.040]  I can't tell you what's satisfying as a woman because I'm not a woman, than to know you're
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:35:00.000]  in the right and to not be a coward and commit to a mission and have no fear and just be focused
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.880]  on that operation. There's something incredibly empowering about turning loose of any fear or any
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:14.960]  doubt and then just committing to what you've got to get done now. So I'm going to play some
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:19.520]  clips here of Trump and just remember all the crimes the globalists have committed, all the
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:25.400]  open evil, all the gain of function, creating the viruses, human trafficking, drug dealing, war,
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:34.520]  breaking up families, transgender surgeries, cutting off our pipelines, attacking our energy
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:41.440]  sector, starving the third world to death. It's just unfathomable what they've done. I want you
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:47.200]  to really energize your mind and focus on it to know the crimes they've committed and to commit
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:53.760]  to resist them in every way you can. So here's a couple clips we'll play back-to-back. Trump
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:58.080]  discusses the deep state's ultimate goal here to criminalize all opposition to rigged elections
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:03.760]  and in the most important clip he says, clip 10, I'm sorry I won't be able to go to Iowa today,
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:11.560]  I won't be able to go to New Hampshire today because I'm sitting in a courtroom on BS because
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:16.480]  the Attorney General charged me with something. I'm going to do something here. We're on hundreds
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:20.600]  of radio stations, hundreds of TV stations, and I'm not a vulgar person, I've got a pretty big
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:26.760]  vocabulary, but sometimes the good bullshit is a nice exclamation point at the end of something.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:31.120]  And we've got delays and we always delay things. But let me explain something. Leftist shows on
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:36.480]  broadcast radio and TV can cuss all they want. The Democrats can cuss all they want. Biden can
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:41.960]  cuss all he wants. But then when conservatives do it, still occasionally the FCC will come in
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:47.160]  and say that's a fine, you're not allowed to do that. Why are they allowed to do it but we aren't?
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:52.960]  You know, they can sexualize children and have drag queen story time with men and in some cases
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:57.560]  shaking their schlongs at people's faces. And I'm not going to show that, but four years ago,
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:06.760]  was it five years ago, Millie Weaver in Austin at a major hotel ballroom went to a drag queen
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:11.720]  burlesque show where children as young as two were putting money in the g-strings of men,
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:16.560]  shaking their butts at people's faces, and then dudes came out with their penises hanging out,
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:24.560]  but they had glitter on them so it's okay. And there's a dude with like a limp, still gigantic
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:30.520]  penis with silver glitter on it with little kids posing while his penis dangles around. Now,
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:36.000]  we showed that five years ago and a bunch of TV stations, we were on a lot of TV and cable
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.200]  stations calls, they said, listen, we got a bunch of complaints, you can't show that.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:46.320]  And I called up one station owner in like Oregon, another called from Mississippi,
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.000]  a call from New York. I called a couple of them back, John Harmon that does relations
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.200]  called a bunch back. And we said to him, we said, listen, this is being done to children.
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:59.279]  Do you think we want to show this? How do they show on PBS or NPR? Decades ago,
[00:37:59.279 --> 00:38:03.920]  I'd be watching PBS when I'm 35 years ago when I was in high school or you know, in junior high,
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:09.160]  I'd be watching PBS sometimes, I like science shows and they would show some documentary and
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:13.880]  it'd be naked kids burned with napalm and running around. And my mom goes, no, no,
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:19.480]  Walter Cronkite showed that. And that helped begin the end of the Vietnam War showing little naked
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:25.000]  boys and girls with their skin burned off running down the road on 35 millimeter black and white
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.960]  film. I said, well, wait, how do they show that? She says, it's documentary, son. So it's not done
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:36.640]  to be gratuitous. It's done to show you the reality. So I'm going to let our stations to
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:41.600]  give them a heads up and we'll do it before we do it. We'll put a parental discretion advised up.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:45.440]  But you know what? If people want to dump our show over this, you're going to have to,
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:49.960]  I get it. I understand. I don't want to look at this, but I'm going to show Walter Cronkite.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:54.520]  We've got the clip saying, this is hard to watch, but I'm going to show this to you. Naked children
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:58.160]  with their penises and vaginas all burned and their arms all burned with their skin hanging off.
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:06.080]  And that's in the late sixties. That's on TV or 1970. Now, why was it okay for Walter Cronkite
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:11.520]  to show you, but I can't see the left strained us where they can go teach these kids this evil
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:21.520]  pedophilic crap and it's okay, but then we can't show it and say it's wrong. We got some complaints
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:26.400]  last week from some TV stations saying, uh, please don't show a transgender surgery of male
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:31.120]  to female. Again, we don't want to dump your show. What am I supposed to do? That's what they
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:37.520]  do to the children. If we do not show it, how are we supposed to stop it? You think I want to look
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:41.920]  at someone having their penis cut off? You think that's what I want to put on TV? Believe me,
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:48.240]  it's cringe. I get it. And that's why maybe we should open the phones up the next few days and
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:54.080]  ask listeners, what do you think I should do? Should we just hide this stuff or should I show
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:40:00.240]  you Austin, Texas and other recent events because we blurted this out of men on bicycles in New York
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:06.320]  and Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington, literally walking around with their genitals
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:13.600]  hanging out, shaking them in front of children. And the police say in Toronto and everywhere they
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:20.240]  go, well, they're allowed to do it because it's gay pride. If you or I, which I would never want
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:24.000]  to do, went to a park and pulled our genitals out in front of a child, it's five years in
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.920]  prison and it should be. Why are they allowed? It's because we don't call them out and we don't
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:35.680]  show it. Walter Cronkite was right to show the burned children naked with their clothes burned
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:41.760]  off. And he was right to show people self-immolating. Pull up the eight millimeter footage
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.600]  of the Buddhist monk pouring gasoline on himself and lighting himself on fire. People don't want to
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:49.760]  see this. This is what war is, ladies and gentlemen. You think I want to see somebody
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:55.040]  burning themselves up with gasoline? It's obscene. It's disgusting. It's happening.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:07.520]  And conservatives want to hide while all this is happening and just hide in our houses and hope
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.279]  that nobody says anything.
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.520]  That's somebody that thought the war was horrible, the millions dying was wrong. So
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:22.320]  they did a sacrifice. I'm not even endorsing it, but you got to respect the will.
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.320]  What's it going to take us to do to get this to stop?
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.000]  If I could defeat the new world order by setting myself on fire, I'd do it. I'm not suicidal,
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:45.760]  but I respect that. If I could beat them doing that, I would set myself on fire right now.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.240]  I couldn't get the gasoline on my flesh quick enough.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:54.000]  I definitely soaked myself in the gills though, make sure I didn't survive because that's hell
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.160]  on earth if you do. But we don't have to set ourselves on fire. All we got to do is skip the
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:07.360]  break. All we got to do is do what we did with Bud Light, 41 billion lost in market,
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:14.000]  25% of all their brands dead. They've learned a big lesson. But instead of boycotting,
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:19.520]  how about a boycott? Don't even buy our products. How about you just share the article, share the
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:23.200]  videos? How about you put a billboard up for Infowars? A lot of you have done that. I commend
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:29.440]  you. That gets past the censors. I was sent over the last four days, five or six examples by friends,
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:37.600]  family, and others where they're trying to send friends and family clips of Infowars or Infowars
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:43.440]  links, and it's being blocked by the browsers that their internet companies are using.
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:47.440]  So this is next level censorship. And if it happens to us, it's going to happen to you. So
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.880]  we've got a word of mouth, tell folks about Infowars.com.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:43:00.720]  Yeah, it's 400 million in sales, but their stock is down 40 plus billion.
[00:43:03.279 --> 00:43:11.920]  Their overall sales are down 25%. But what about boycotts being used? How about boycotts?
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:15.920]  That's the answer. We have to build the infrastructure. We can't just not support
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:18.960]  the enemy. We've got to build our own thing. That's where Infowars comes in.
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:20.640]  Before I get the rest of this news, let me just say this.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.720]  We have incredible game-changing products that just like our information changes the world,
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:31.680]  will change your life. You need our 3,000 milligrams CBD oil for neurological systems,
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.880]  your joints, your bones, your whole body. It's incredible the best there is. 30%,
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.720]  33% off what this company sells it all over the country for. It's one of the top labels.
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:45.120]  We private labeled it under Rebel Zen. Doesn't get you high, doesn't make you tired, does the
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:51.520]  opposite. I'm on it right now. Clarifies, focuses you, makes you way more, I would say just
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:58.800]  confident. It's 33% off Rebel Zen, 3,000 milligram to take under the tongue and also an incredibly
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:05.440]  powerful salve for sore muscles, joints, and bones. Get vitamin mineral fusion.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.200]  But let me tell you, I meant to give this to the crew,
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:11.600]  to text this to you because I went over and had a meeting with the sales guys this morning and
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:17.040]  saw what we have here. And here's what's selling out. So this stuff will not be on sale within a
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:22.400]  week because it's selling out. Some of this won't be on sale just a few days. All the storable food,
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:27.040]  air and water filtration, highest quality air and water filtration, already super low price,
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:33.040]  but 10% off is the best you're going to find anywhere on Alexa Pure and Alexa Pure Breeze,
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:37.600]  both water and air filtration. Queral oil about to sell out, bone broth about to sell out,
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:44.240]  turbo force about to sell out. And despite that, it's still all on sale at infowarestore.com.
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:48.400]  Or 888-253-3139.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:52.400]  Also, we got a first shipment of Vitamin Mineral Fusion sold out for five months.
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:55.400]  All the vitamins, all the minerals, everything you need, key amino acids.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:59.400]  So many problems are the fact that people are taking synthetic vitamins,
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.400]  or they're not getting enough vitamins and minerals in their food or amino acids.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:09.400]  This is all the high quality ones that you absorb in one little scoop you put in a pitcher of water
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:12.400]  and then put in your refrigerator, have a drink in the morning, noon and night,
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:16.400]  take it to work with you. Great for adults, children, but especially old folks.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:20.400]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, get it all in one spot. It's back at stock discounting.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:23.400]  We got a limited shipment. It'll be sold out in days at current sales rates.
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:27.400]  It'll be three weeks to a month before more comes in. So get that.
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:33.400]  Infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:37.400]  We don't have George Soros. We have you. And we've proven we're fighting.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:41.400]  We've proven we're having a huge effect. We're proving we're changing the world.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:45.400]  So share the articles and videos. Tell folks about the forbidden URL.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:49.400]  Get around the AI. Do it word of mouth. Overpower the system. Infowarestore.com.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:54.400]  Ban.video. Take clips out. Keep sharing it. You know who you are. I commend you.
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:58.400]  You're the reason this is all happening. You're just as important as I am.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:02.400]  Get a copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, either signed or unsigned.
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:05.400]  The signed copies are almost gone. That's a fundraiser.
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:10.400]  But take action whatever you do, and I thank you humbly for your support.
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:16.400]  Infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:20.400]  But look at what President Trump is doing.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:24.400]  Indicted three times. About to be indicted a fourth time in Georgia
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:29.400]  by George Soros-funded and installed globalist puppets.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:33.400]  And they admit when they get Trump, they're coming after everybody else.
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:39.400]  They're declaring that opposition to their New World Order is illegal because it's unpopular.
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:46.400]  And the people are turning against them. But this criminal, permanent deep state is not giving up.
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:50.400]  They're illegal. They're illegitimate. They're a fraud. They're unpopular.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:54.400]  They're stupid. They're corrupt. But they have the big banks and the megacorporations
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:59.400]  and the UN behind them, and they're still just bulldozing over us.
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:05.400]  Shame on people that didn't want to be censored.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:10.400]  Who came out against Trump even before he made the mistake and pushed the poison shot,
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.400]  which is still a terrible black mark on him.
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:20.400]  But I saw all these other talk show hosts that wouldn't support him seven, eight, nine years ago.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:26.400]  And then who love bashing Trump all day and talking about where he didn't do the right thing
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:30.400]  or where he messed up and brought a deep state person in who he's now exposing on after,
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:38.400]  Bill Barr, others. But they don't talk about Biden and Obama and Prince Charles, King Charles
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.400]  and the globalists and Klaus Schwab and their New World Order.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:46.400]  They just holier-than-thou all day bash and attack Trump because it makes them feel good
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:50.400]  and because they get promoted on social media when they do it.
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:57.400]  When I knew Q was a fraud and was bad, for sure, about four or five years ago,
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:03.400]  some of the folks that set up the original thing and it got taken away from them by MSM and Big Tech
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:09.400]  was when they told you everything was going to be fine, go to sleep, you didn't have to do anything.
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:20.400]  But was also when they began to attack all the original people that were real and who were public
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:23.400]  and who'd been battling the whole globalist program.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:27.400]  So they're going to try to infiltrate our movements, they're going to try to lead them,
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.400]  they're going to try to misdirect them. We can't let them do that.
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:34.400]  And we have to understand that there isn't some magic group supporting Trump.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:37.400]  There isn't some secret army so you can feel good.
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:40.400]  Because I know this is scary. You have to admit we do have a secret army.
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:43.400]  It's called God and his angels. It's called Jesus Christ.
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:47.400]  He sent down here to give us the owner's manual and the cheat sheet.
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:52.400]  We have free will, but God gave us a cheat sheet to make the right decision.
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:57.400]  But you are God's army. It's you that's going to have to spread the word.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:59.400]  It's you that's going to have to share the articles.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.400]  It's you that's going to have to go speak at city council.
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:03.400]  It's you that's going to have to run for office.
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:07.400]  It's you that's going to have to donate and support institutions and organizations that tell the truth.
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:11.400]  It's you. It's you. Look in the mirror.
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:15.400]  Not some magic secret army.
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:24.300]  And I can tell you the good news, and I'll go to these clips.
[00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:29.220]  By the grace of God and your work keeping us on air, Infowars is the most influential
[00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:35.740]  media organization being listened to by the entire resistance, whether it's RFK Jr. or
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:41.020]  Tulsi Gabbard's on the supposed left, or there's Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan and the Tate
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:45.500]  Brothers and all those other people.
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:52.140]  We are the recognized experts on this, this broadcast, what we do, what I do.
[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:55.780]  And I'm only bringing that information to let you know the importance of your support
[00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:58.740]  and the importance of what you've done, because they tell me this.
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:49:59.740]  They call me.
[00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:02.740]  I have dinner with these people.
[00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:05.940]  Some of the names I've met with, and I'm not going to say I've met with them, because the
[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:10.060]  enemy will use that against them, but you can put two and two together.
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:11.060]  People get it.
[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:12.060]  They know they're under attack.
[00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:17.300]  They get there's no way out of this unless we recognize we're under attack.
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:23.500]  So we're doing our most important work ever now, realize the critical juncture, the crossroads
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:24.500]  we're in now.
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:29.220]  So let's start with one of these clips, play clip nine and 10 back to back.
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:30.860]  Here's Trump knocking out of the park.
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:32.580]  Think of the level of election meddling.
[00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:33.820]  It's beyond election meddling.
[00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:38.420]  They're indicting the leading candidate in the primary and against Biden.
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:42.580]  They are trying to pin him down while they commit all these mass crimes in front of us
[00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:46.300]  and won't even go after Fauci, who's producing bioweapons that could kill us all.
[00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:49.100]  They don't even care about their own self preservation.
[00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:50.420]  Here it is.
[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:57.060]  But in the other case, it's free speech means that we cannot ever criticize or look after
[00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.060]  election.
[00:50:58.060 --> 00:50:59.600]  Once that happens, you have tyranny.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.820]  We can't look at elections.
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:02.020]  We cannot criticize.
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:06.940]  Well, Hillary Clinton criticized and all of these Stacey Abrams still hasn't conceded.
[00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:09.340]  I mean, all of these people criticize.
[00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:14.340]  I mean, you would have half of Congress right now in jail.
[00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:16.700]  It's the craziest thing I've ever seen.
[00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:19.660]  He is criticizing the election.
[00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:24.300]  And let me tell you, there's a lot to criticize, which you'll find out over the coming weeks.
[00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:29.780]  Isn't it terrible that a political opponent, though, can haphazardly charge you with a
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:34.420]  fake crime in the middle of your campaign in order to interfere with your time, your
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:35.420]  money, your message?
[00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:40.100]  And there is nothing you can do in theory to stop this travesty of justice.
[00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:41.660]  Isn't that a shame?
[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:47.180]  How can my corrupt political opponent, crooked Joe Biden, put me on trial during an election
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:53.140]  campaign that I'm winning by a lot, but forcing me nevertheless to spend time and money away
[00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:59.180]  from the campaign trail in order to fight bogus made up accusations and charges?
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:00.180]  That's what they're doing.
[00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:01.180]  I'm sorry.
[00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:02.460]  I won't be able to go to Iowa today.
[00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:07.780]  I won't be able to go to New Hampshire today because I'm sitting in a courtroom on bullshit
[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:15.180]  because his attorney general charged me with terrible.
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:35.980]  And you notice we didn't delay that.
[00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:40.940]  Walter Cronkite can show you children naked with their skin burn off and it's OK.
[00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:43.940]  The Democrats can flop men's penises in front of little kids faces.
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:45.660]  We're not just showed to you.
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:47.900]  Democrats can cuss all over broadcast TV, radio.
[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:48.900]  They're fine.
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:50.860]  But if we do, we're bad.
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:54.400]  It's time to stop letting them live by double standards.
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:57.100]  We don't want to shake penises and children's faces.
[00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:58.100]  But you know what?
[00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:02.420]  If they do it, we're going to show it to you, even if you don't want to look at it.
[00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:05.140]  And that'll end this crap real fast.
[00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:10.020]  If a couple of little girls and boys with their skin burned off helped in the Vietnam
[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:13.060]  War, what's it gonna take for us to do?
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:15.180]  Stop hiding it.
[00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:19.220]  Because when we hide the reality of what's going on, we become accomplices to it.
[00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:20.540]  I'm still not gonna have a big crash show.
[00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:22.020]  I'm not gonna have a bunch of cussing on here.
[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:23.500]  This is not some comedy program.
[00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:25.620]  This is deadly serious.
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:29.740]  And it is bullshit what's going on.
[00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:30.740]  It's crap.
[00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:31.740]  All right.
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:33.300]  We've been talking about that.
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:34.860]  Let's go to a black gentleman.
[00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:40.020]  I'm seeing so many black folks all over Twitter, Facebook, you name it, saying the same thing.
[00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:43.220]  Man says, the more you go after Trump, the more we're going to support him.
[00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:45.420]  Here's a clip.
[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:49.460]  The more you indict, the more we vote.
[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:54.100]  The more you indict, the more money we send.
[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:56.020]  We're going to vote for Donald Trump.
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:57.780]  You can drum up dossiers.
[00:53:57.780 --> 00:53:59.700]  You can drum up indictments.
[00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:01.420]  You can do all of that.
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:05.460]  The more you do it, the more we vote for Trump.
[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:10.100]  So do what you want to, you know, throw us all in jail, indict all of us.
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:14.860]  We're still voting for Donald Trump and it has nothing to do with Donald Trump.
[00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:21.620]  It has everything to do with the job that he did when he was sitting in the seat.
[00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:24.260]  Our gas prices was low.
[00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:25.820]  Our economy was booming.
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:29.740]  The world was at peace with nobody stealing.
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:30.740]  He didn't need to steal.
[00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:33.700]  This man's worth almost $9 billion.
[00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:35.660]  Joe Biden needs to steal.
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:37.260]  He's a career politician.
[00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:41.300]  He's done stealing, gave his family $10 million.
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:46.420]  Here for his daughter, $10 million for Hunter, $10 million for a dead son.
[00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:49.980]  His wife, everybody done stole money in his family.
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:51.500]  Everybody.
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:54.660]  For the last 60 years, this man has been stealing money.
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:56.860]  And you wonder why we voting for Trump?
[00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:58.820]  Because y'all drumming up stuff?
[00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:01.140]  Because you got the FBI in your back pocket?
[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:03.500]  Because you got the CIA in your back pocket?
[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.100]  It's not going to influence our votes.
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:08.500]  Now, if you want to steal the election like you did the last one, go right ahead.
[00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:09.500]  We know you stole it.
[00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:14.620]  Ain't no way in the world this man having 60,000 people at a rally.
[00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:18.820]  And this man's got 800 people at his rally and he wins the election.
[00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:22.180]  Man, you know, Arizona holding out their results.
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:28.540]  All these, all these states holding out their results because they taking buyoffs too, man.
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:29.540]  This man has been paying off.
[00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:31.340]  He paid off Ukraine.
[00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:33.340]  He paid off Russia for the dossier.
[00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:38.140]  This man's paid off everybody, man.
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:43.460]  And Senator McCarthy or whatever you are, Representative McCarthy, you're worthless, dude.
[00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:44.460]  You're worthless.
[00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:48.300]  Go handle your debt ceiling, man.
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:50.140]  You are worthless.
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:55.820]  You do us no good, none, okay?
[00:55:55.820 --> 00:56:00.220]  This man has been indicted four times since you've been in office and you haven't indicted
[00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:04.780]  these stealing people, not once.
[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:13.260]  Biden's stealing everything, stealing money, stealing access, okay, shut down our gas pipeline
[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:16.820]  and our gas went out the roof.
[00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:20.420]  You're darn right we still voting for Trump and it ain't got nothing to do with Donald
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:21.420]  Trump.
[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:23.820]  It's got everything to do with Donald Trump's policy.
[00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:30.660]  It's got everything to do with Donald Trump's past experience in the office, in the seat.
[00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:34.420]  We see the difference.
[00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:37.020]  You think we need to have indictment?
[00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:42.300]  We don't care about no dang indictments about something he did before he was president.
[00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:50.820]  Man worth $9 billion, I'm sure he did a lot of stuff, okay, before he was president.
[00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:54.180]  Just because you hate him, don't mean that we hate him.
[00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:57.900]  And I don't even know the man, I don't care to know him.
[00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:02.180]  Just put him back in office because he did the best job in there.
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:07.420]  Not Biden, not Obama, I don't even want to talk about that dude.
[00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:11.820]  Did nothing, nothing for eight years, nothing.
[00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:13.380]  But I'm sorry, you did.
[00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:15.900]  Evidently, you was blackmailing Ukraine.
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:21.300]  And when Joe Biden was blackmailing Ukraine, because you're the big guy, y'all ain't gonna
[00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:23.660]  ask him no questions.
[00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:29.420]  News reporters scared because they Rhino, Fox scared because they Rhino.
[00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:32.140]  They're scared because they're bought and paid for and the people see right through
[00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:33.140]  it.
[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:34.140]  We're in an incredible time.
[00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:35.940]  Hour number two coming up right now.
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:36.940]  The phone's up.
[00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:41.020]  I got so much news, so many topics to cover, so many video clips.
[00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:42.580]  I'm so blessed to be here.
[00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:44.140]  Thank you all for keeping us on air.
[00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:45.140]  Thanks to the great crew.
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:46.540]  I'll spread the word right now.
[00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:54.590]  Tell us about the products, how we support you, how we support all of ourselves and the
[00:57:54.590 --> 00:57:55.590]  big event coming up.
[00:57:55.590 --> 00:58:01.110]  Well, yeah, let's, the first one, you obviously can go to mypillow.com, use that promo code
[00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:05.750]  Alex, and you can get all these great discounts on all of our products.
[00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:11.470]  And just by visiting this site, you're going to get a $20 free gift emailed to you immediately.
[00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:15.750]  And there's the biggest special we have right now, the 20 year anniversary of MyPillow for
[00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:20.350]  1998 for the queen size, normally $69.98.
[00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:25.390]  We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love to invest, producing and
[00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:27.150]  making the MyPillow.
[00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:34.270]  And the model of businessmen and women with can-do know-how, using the money for Americana
[00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:36.790]  freedom to fight the globalists is what they fear.
[00:58:36.790 --> 00:58:38.270]  That's what the debanking is about.
[00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:40.069]  That's what the financial attacks are about.
[00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:44.870]  That's why we've got a rush to support mypillow.com and InfoWars.com, plus their great products
[00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:47.990]  in both places, because we are the tip of the spear.
[00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:39.310]  So thank you for your support, but whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the
[00:59:39.310 --> 00:59:40.870]  articles and the videos.
[00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:44.310]  That you can do for free, and that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[00:59:44.310 --> 00:59:47.509]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now.
[00:59:47.509 --> 00:59:49.190]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:50.190]  God bless you.
[00:59:50.190 --> 01:00:00.790]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:00.790 --> 01:00:11.230]  I respect China's achievements, which are tremendous over the last over 40 years.
[01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:17.910]  The Chinese model is certainly a very attractive model for quite a number of countries.
[01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:21.430]  Real super hardcore evil demons have taken over.
[01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:23.870]  And they've already got China and a billion and a half people.
[01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:29.310]  I'm here to meet one of the 10 million people who've seen the dark side of the social credit
[01:00:29.310 --> 01:00:33.430]  system, investigative journalist Leo Hu.
[01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:39.230]  His poor social credit rating has shut down his travel options and confined him to effective
[01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:41.670]  house arrest in Chongqing.
[01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:43.750]  WeChat started as a messaging app.
[01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:45.910]  Then it transformed into Chinese Facebook.
[01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:49.430]  And then it added a ride hailing service similar to Uber to its platform.
[01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:51.670]  And then it added banking services to its platform.
[01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:53.110]  And now you can use it as an ID.
[01:00:53.110 --> 01:00:54.790]  This will make your life very convenient.
[01:00:54.790 --> 01:00:59.049]  But at the same time, it also becomes very convenient for state security to track you.
[01:00:59.049 --> 01:01:01.990]  To combat message interceptions, they talk through emojis.
[01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:04.750]  A half fallen rose means someone has been arrested.
[01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:07.190]  A dark moon means they're going to prison camps.
[01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:11.470]  A sun emoji means they are alive and a flower means they have been released.
[01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:16.630]  China is positioning itself to lead the world in artificial intelligence.
[01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:20.190]  Surveillance technology is a key proving ground.
[01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:26.509]  Facial recognition, body scanning and geo tracking matched with your personal data and
[01:01:26.509 --> 01:01:33.750]  online behavior will power the social credit system, leaving no dark corner to hide in.
[01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:35.930]  And you can say, well, this is just innovation.
[01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:38.049]  But it's not innovation the way it's being done.
[01:01:38.049 --> 01:01:39.049]  It's absolute tyranny.
[01:01:39.049 --> 01:01:40.290]  And now it's here.
[01:01:40.290 --> 01:01:41.970]  And guess who created the bill?
[01:01:41.970 --> 01:01:46.850]  Senator Blumenthal, the quarterbacks, the government operations against me on record
[01:01:46.850 --> 01:01:49.250]  with the Carnegie Endowment and the CIA.
[01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:55.250]  This bill is designed to make sure that they have your home address before you can actually
[01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:58.290]  post about anything on the Internet.
[01:01:58.290 --> 01:02:00.970]  The bill is Senate Bill 1409.
[01:02:00.970 --> 01:02:02.650]  Forty senators have sponsored it.
[01:02:02.650 --> 01:02:04.330]  Republicans and Democrats.
[01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:06.210]  This isn't a left or right issue.
[01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:08.009]  This is a speech issue.
[01:02:08.009 --> 01:02:12.529]  And they call the bill the Kids Online Safety Act or COSA for short.
[01:02:12.529 --> 01:02:16.810]  But in reality, this is some garbage to make sure that they know where you live when you
[01:02:16.810 --> 01:02:17.810]  post.
[01:02:17.810 --> 01:02:21.730]  But whether you're a conservative or a liberal or whatever you are, there are so many people
[01:02:21.730 --> 01:02:26.170]  going along with the New World Order who even know it's real.
[01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:30.170]  But they think, well, I'll just go along with it and I'll have a better lifestyle if I go
[01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:31.170]  along with it.
[01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:32.170]  No.
[01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:35.850]  This is what's happening in China right now with the social credit score, where the government
[01:02:35.850 --> 01:02:40.930]  is monitoring and surveilling all the people from the beginning to end.
[01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:45.170]  Everything that they do, everything, everywhere where they walk, it's, you know, they control
[01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:47.490]  everything and they watch everything.
[01:02:47.490 --> 01:02:49.009]  This is the example of a tyranny.
[01:02:49.009 --> 01:02:52.770]  When the government knows everything about you, where you go, what you eat, where you
[01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:55.450]  enter, that's a tyrannical system.
[01:02:55.450 --> 01:02:59.569]  And we've seen this system being implemented right now under the leadership of Ursula von
[01:02:59.569 --> 01:03:03.130]  der Leyen, slowly but surely in the European Union.
[01:03:03.130 --> 01:03:05.490]  The green certificate was just the first step.
[01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:09.370]  There are a few more proposals right now under debate in the parliament.
[01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:15.050]  All these things that are creating a system that will monitor, control, supervise and
[01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:18.109]  condition the rights of all the European citizens.
[01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:23.450]  The heart of the Mark of the Beast system is a worldwide Internet ID.
[01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:27.330]  The UN's already standardized it, communist China standardized it, and it's the Internet
[01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:32.370]  ID that's tied to your smartphone, your smart devices, your car, your ability to get on
[01:03:32.370 --> 01:03:35.210]  airplanes, get hotels, have insurance, have a job.
[01:03:35.210 --> 01:03:41.290]  And then that's tied to your carbon tax, your vaccine passport tax that operates and gets
[01:03:41.290 --> 01:03:44.170]  its orders from your social credit score.
[01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:51.490]  The foundation and the structure of the entire system is based on the Internet ID that is
[01:03:51.490 --> 01:03:53.210]  then tied to your digital ID.
[01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:59.290]  Jeff Bezos, Amazon owned Whole Foods, is announcing worldwide in the next three months
[01:03:59.290 --> 01:04:02.850]  they're putting palm scanners in to be able to buy and sell.
[01:04:02.850 --> 01:04:06.569]  And in many Whole Foods and other grocery stores in Europe, they're already making you
[01:04:06.569 --> 01:04:12.170]  scan your phone or your hand to get in to the grocery stores, not just Whole Paycheck
[01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:13.569]  as Whole Foods is known.
[01:04:17.569 --> 01:04:18.810]  That's the coolest thing ever.
[01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:21.050]  So this is already being set up for a long time.
[01:04:21.050 --> 01:04:25.410]  Now they're getting ready to go, oh, you didn't know under law there's a whole history
[01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:28.490]  of what you search and what you do and where you go.
[01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:32.930]  We're talking about a republic that we're losing and it's being destroyed by design.
[01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:38.130]  And now global corporations think we're a bunch of dumb animals and they'll incentivize
[01:04:38.130 --> 01:04:43.850]  accepting the world government, cashless society, programmable central bank digital currencies
[01:04:43.850 --> 01:04:49.850]  and ESGs and the rest of them because we get little credits and little prizes up front
[01:04:49.890 --> 01:04:54.890]  to be the first suckers to grease the skids over the cliff into Hades.
[01:04:59.410 --> 01:05:03.850]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through mother nature has given us the
[01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:04.850]  answer.
[01:05:04.850 --> 01:05:09.050]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum CBD oil, the incredible things it
[01:05:09.050 --> 01:05:14.650]  does for your nerves, your brain, your entire physiological system for your nervous system
[01:05:14.650 --> 01:05:15.650]  particularly.
[01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:17.690]  Everybody knows it's incredible it works.
[01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:22.490]  We have the strongest, best CBD oil you're going to find anywhere at the lowest price.
[01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:29.370]  Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for 30% more because that's who we're getting it from.
[01:05:29.370 --> 01:05:32.009]  Made right here in Central Texas.
[01:05:32.009 --> 01:05:35.650]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:41.130]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country
[01:05:41.130 --> 01:05:44.250]  that's based right here in Texas and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:47.930]  Here's what's even crazier, 30% off of what they're selling it for.
[01:05:47.930 --> 01:05:51.130]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[01:05:51.130 --> 01:05:55.490]  So this is the highest rated, already at the lowest price, now even a lower price.
[01:05:55.490 --> 01:06:00.730]  Rebel Zen, get yours at InfoWarsStore.com now.
[01:06:00.730 --> 01:06:05.770]  In a galaxy torn by conflict, where darkness spreads its tendrils across the universe,
[01:06:05.770 --> 01:06:09.050]  one hero rises against the immeasurable might of the globalists.
[01:06:09.370 --> 01:06:14.090]  Tune in and trust in the power of the truth to lead us to victory in the great info war.
[01:06:14.090 --> 01:06:18.170]  Prepare for the ultimate battle for truth with today's war room broadcast.
[01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:22.890]  Now, it's your host, Owen Schroer and his intrepid crew.
[01:06:22.890 --> 01:06:27.370]  Find the show and share the links at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:06:39.050 --> 01:06:50.009]  And I wanted to run that little promo for Owen Schroer.
[01:06:50.009 --> 01:06:54.970]  He's not hosting my show today, but he'll be hosting the war room at 3 p.m. central,
[01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:57.850]  coming up in a little less than three hours on radio stations,
[01:06:57.850 --> 01:07:01.930]  TV stations across the country at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:07:01.930 --> 01:07:03.130]  The coordinates of freedom.
[01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:05.690]  It's your mission to share that link to everyone you know.
[01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:07.690]  If you choose to accept it, let them know.
[01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.529]  This is the forbidden verboten links.
[01:07:11.930 --> 01:07:12.330]  All right.
[01:07:12.330 --> 01:07:15.290]  I said I'd take calls on any subject you want to raise,
[01:07:15.290 --> 01:07:18.650]  but I'd like to hear from you on the Trump indictments and all the insanity and
[01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:23.290]  just the incredible corruption of Biden and how he's being openly protected.
[01:07:24.569 --> 01:07:30.330]  And the escalations in the Ukraine war that there is so much we're going to get to.
[01:07:30.330 --> 01:07:33.210]  Klaus Schwab's daughter has climbed out from under a rock.
[01:07:33.210 --> 01:07:35.050]  She's one of the deputy heads of the W.E.F.
[01:07:36.090 --> 01:07:40.090]  But said, quote, permanent climate lockdowns are coming, whether you like it or not.
[01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:40.810]  Close quote.
[01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:42.009]  Wow.
[01:07:43.770 --> 01:07:45.770]  Who died and made these guys God?
[01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:48.569]  Well, they certainly think they are God.
[01:07:49.210 --> 01:07:52.250]  So we've got that news coming up as well.
[01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:55.770]  But I want to play an astounding Bill Gates clip.
[01:07:57.770 --> 01:08:02.250]  He just did an interview over the weekend, and I just discovered it yesterday on InfoWars.com.
[01:08:03.529 --> 01:08:07.850]  And there he is on a national international television program saying,
[01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:08.810]  well, you'll see what he says.
[01:08:09.450 --> 01:08:10.410]  It's crazy.
[01:08:10.410 --> 01:08:12.970]  People think I'm a cabal leader.
[01:08:12.970 --> 01:08:14.810]  They think the shots don't work.
[01:08:14.810 --> 01:08:15.770]  They think they hurt you.
[01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:17.290]  It's just crazy.
[01:08:17.290 --> 01:08:19.370]  There's a minority of people.
[01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:23.530]  Really, it's approaching a majority who just are crazy.
[01:08:24.889 --> 01:08:26.330]  So they admit the shots don't work.
[01:08:26.330 --> 01:08:28.889]  They now admit they're causing myocarditis and heart attacks.
[01:08:28.889 --> 01:08:29.850]  That's mainstream news.
[01:08:29.850 --> 01:08:31.930]  They they admit it destroys your immune system.
[01:08:32.650 --> 01:08:33.690]  We have all this carnage.
[01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:36.650]  And here he is going jeepers creepers.
[01:08:37.850 --> 01:08:40.090]  Like people think I hang out with Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:08:40.090 --> 01:08:41.210]  I only met him once.
[01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:42.410]  Met him hundreds of times.
[01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:44.490]  Went to his island 20 plus times.
[01:08:44.490 --> 01:08:47.210]  This is Bill Gates in damage control.
[01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:51.770]  And all the king's horses and all the king's men and all the new world order's propaganda
[01:08:52.330 --> 01:08:55.530]  cannot put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[01:08:55.530 --> 01:08:56.490]  Not the censorship.
[01:08:57.130 --> 01:08:58.410]  Not any of it.
[01:08:58.410 --> 01:09:01.210]  And then you got Rand Paul sending letters last week.
[01:09:01.210 --> 01:09:06.490]  Week and a half ago to the FBI to the Justice Department saying here's Fauci lying.
[01:09:06.490 --> 01:09:09.770]  Here he is saying he didn't gain a function research before.
[01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:10.970]  Now here he is saying he didn't.
[01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:11.850]  That's lying to Congress.
[01:09:11.850 --> 01:09:12.650]  I want him indicted.
[01:09:13.770 --> 01:09:14.410]  Cut and dry.
[01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:18.010]  Like if I was in Congress and they said, Mr.
[01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:19.370]  Jones, what color shirt are you wearing?
[01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:20.809]  And I said, I'm wearing a green shirt.
[01:09:22.170 --> 01:09:22.809]  They said, Mr.
[01:09:22.809 --> 01:09:24.330]  Jones, you're under oath here.
[01:09:24.330 --> 01:09:25.770]  You're you're wearing a black shirt, sir.
[01:09:25.770 --> 01:09:26.650]  Just say it's a black shirt.
[01:09:26.650 --> 01:09:27.210]  Nope.
[01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:28.090]  It's it's purple.
[01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:30.410]  Well, you just said it was green.
[01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:30.809]  No, I didn't.
[01:09:30.809 --> 01:09:31.530]  I said it was yellow.
[01:09:32.330 --> 01:09:33.610]  But it's a black shirt, sir.
[01:09:33.610 --> 01:09:36.730]  You need to get the Supreme Court nominees.
[01:09:37.610 --> 01:09:38.970]  Can you tell me what a woman is?
[01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:40.650]  No, I can't say what a woman is.
[01:09:40.650 --> 01:09:43.850]  A woman is a man with a big beard with his penis dangling between his legs.
[01:09:44.410 --> 01:09:48.809]  I mean, it's the murder of logic and them saying, do what we say.
[01:09:48.809 --> 01:09:50.010]  And we won't call you racist.
[01:09:50.010 --> 01:09:50.650]  Do what we say.
[01:09:50.650 --> 01:09:52.809]  We'll give you a universal basic income.
[01:09:52.809 --> 01:09:55.290]  You know, the social credit score won't come after you.
[01:09:55.290 --> 01:09:55.790]  So.
[01:09:56.889 --> 01:10:00.809]  The toll free number to join us is eight, seven, seven, seven, eight, nine, two, five,
[01:10:00.809 --> 01:10:03.370]  three, nine, eight, seven, seven, seven, eight, nine, Alex.
[01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:05.290]  There it is on screen.
[01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:09.530]  Eight, seven, seven, seven, eight, nine, two, five, three, nine.
[01:10:10.170 --> 01:10:14.170]  We're opening the phones up right now to talk about all this.
[01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:18.250]  I'd love to get your take on what I said at the start of the broadcast last hour.
[01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:20.490]  You get you're under attack.
[01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:22.570]  You get you're in a globalist war to cut off your resources.
[01:10:22.570 --> 01:10:23.770]  You get that.
[01:10:23.770 --> 01:10:26.250]  You can pretend you're part of the system, but you're not.
[01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:27.930]  And I know most of our listeners aren't like that, but.
[01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:29.930]  I really care about.
[01:10:31.050 --> 01:10:32.809]  The prodigal sons and daughters out there.
[01:10:32.809 --> 01:10:33.850]  I really care about those that.
[01:10:35.610 --> 01:10:36.490]  Have served the system.
[01:10:36.490 --> 01:10:38.010]  In fact, I'm soon.
[01:10:38.730 --> 01:10:40.570]  In fact, Rob do forgot today.
[01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:41.770]  And I understand he's a great guy.
[01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:44.090]  I went to Dallas with me to the big Crowder announcement.
[01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:48.090]  I said, hey, you're showing me all these tweets and emails you're getting.
[01:10:48.090 --> 01:10:50.410]  And three members of the broadcast crew.
[01:10:50.410 --> 01:10:52.250]  There's only like five of them, six of them.
[01:10:52.809 --> 01:10:57.850]  They three of them have family members that since they took the vaccine,
[01:10:57.850 --> 01:10:59.610]  the so-called vaccine can't eat beef.
[01:11:01.530 --> 01:11:03.850]  And I'm like, hey, Rob, will you print a bunch of those?
[01:11:03.850 --> 01:11:05.930]  Because I was seeing myself and come on the show tomorrow.
[01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:06.889]  Of course, he forgot.
[01:11:06.889 --> 01:11:07.389]  It's OK.
[01:11:08.410 --> 01:11:10.090]  Because we're never really focused on our broadcast.
[01:11:10.090 --> 01:11:13.370]  It's kind of like a nebulous thing that floats around out there in orbit.
[01:11:13.930 --> 01:11:15.370]  But we want to open the phones up.
[01:11:16.889 --> 01:11:20.889]  If not today, I mean, it's a free for all now, but just for people to talk about meat
[01:11:20.889 --> 01:11:23.130]  allergies, which they admit are tied to the shots.
[01:11:23.130 --> 01:11:25.050]  It's on the CDC FDA website.
[01:11:25.050 --> 01:11:25.930]  Not my opinion.
[01:11:25.930 --> 01:11:26.650]  They've been admitted.
[01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:29.850]  Trying to blame a tick for it now.
[01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:33.850]  People are living in states and countries that don't have the Lone Star tech and are
[01:11:33.850 --> 01:11:34.330]  getting it.
[01:11:34.330 --> 01:11:41.770]  Did the tick bottom from 2000 miles away or 5000 miles away or 15000 miles away in
[01:11:41.770 --> 01:11:42.570]  the case of Australia?
[01:11:42.570 --> 01:11:43.770]  The answer is no.
[01:11:43.770 --> 01:11:44.970]  That's a big deal, too.
[01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:47.290]  So we show up the phones up about.
[01:11:47.850 --> 01:11:49.690]  The meat allergies, you can hear it for yourself.
[01:11:49.690 --> 01:11:53.370]  We should open the phones up for all the heart problems that are happening to show you statistics,
[01:11:53.370 --> 01:12:01.450]  but hearing the callers is a completely different ball of wax, kettle of fish.
[01:12:02.889 --> 01:12:06.330]  And so I want to do that, but also not the phones up.
[01:12:07.930 --> 01:12:11.770]  Specifically on what you think the globalists are going to pull next, what they're going
[01:12:11.770 --> 01:12:13.850]  to do next, Rob has brought me the list here.
[01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:14.970]  I want to have him on the show.
[01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:16.090]  But I guess it's my fault.
[01:12:16.090 --> 01:12:22.730]  I forgot to tell him to get him on to this is just in a tweet that great folks put out
[01:12:22.730 --> 01:12:23.530]  on Twitter.
[01:12:23.530 --> 01:12:25.530]  We're not on Twitter, but a lot of fans are out there.
[01:12:26.410 --> 01:12:28.730]  The last time I checked out about 600000 views.
[01:12:30.010 --> 01:12:33.290]  And here's what people were saying in the comments.
[01:12:34.330 --> 01:12:37.850]  My wife developed beef allergy after two Pfizer shots.
[01:12:38.730 --> 01:12:43.370]  My coworker and two of his first cousins became allergic to beef after the shot.
[01:12:45.850 --> 01:12:47.210]  There's another one, RZA.
[01:12:47.210 --> 01:12:52.809]  I've been hyped, sensitive to allergy since I received my last pneumonia vaccine.
[01:12:52.809 --> 01:12:53.610]  It makes sense.
[01:12:55.290 --> 01:12:55.930]  Let me cue.
[01:12:56.970 --> 01:12:58.330]  How did you get the Cobra jab?
[01:12:58.330 --> 01:13:01.130]  But I did get the tetanus shot seven years ago.
[01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:06.090]  And after driving knife through my throat, I got the tetanus shot.
[01:13:06.570 --> 01:13:08.410]  Driving knife through my hand.
[01:13:08.410 --> 01:13:12.570]  Accidentally, I haven't been able to tolerate milk or beef since because they grow it in
[01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:13.370]  protein somewhere.
[01:13:14.010 --> 01:13:18.250]  I've developed a beef allergy, says Kate, shortly after my four year old.
[01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:27.430]  Shots. I can't eat some meat, but I had the first two years ago, and it made me so sick.
[01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:35.430]  Cindy Bishop, after my friend had her third vax, she can no longer tolerate beef, pork, goat meat, or stew, or other foods.
[01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:40.430]  They trigger headaches and dizziness. Yeah, that's what it says it does. Your mouth swells up like a bee stung you.
[01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:46.430]  Sandy says, weird, I know two people who took the jab, and this happened to them.
[01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:51.430]  Every time they eat meat, it makes them very sick. See, you will eat the bugs.
[01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:57.430]  This happened to me. One of the secretaries at my husband's office, her doctor told her it was from a tick.
[01:13:57.430 --> 01:14:04.430]  Yes, the tick. I can no longer eat meat, says not the real person.
[01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:09.430]  I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy, and they told me I'm allergic.
[01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:13.430]  I have all my immunizations for the COVID-19 infectious disease.
[01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:22.430]  Maximillian Martin says, I got this allergy from a vax who shed on me. I ended up in the hospital.
[01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:25.430]  They now admit it sheds. University of Colorado confirmed it.
[01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:30.430]  I ended up in a hospital emergency surgery to open my throat. I'm a pure blood.
[01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:36.430]  That's just some of the comments. It goes on and on and on.
[01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:44.430]  I know when I covered this on Monday, I was told by the producer that three of you in there have friends and family that can't eat meat now.
[01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:46.430]  Does anybody want to step up to the microphone and tell folks about this?
[01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:52.430]  I'm not saying you have to. I'm just saying we've got to talk about it. We've got to discuss it.
[01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:58.430]  So that's another subject. 877-789-2539.
[01:14:58.430 --> 01:15:02.430]  All right, we're going to go on a break. In about a minute, I'm going to come right back to your calls.
[01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:06.430]  Just remember the way the dog hunts, the way the transmission gets out, the way we win.
[01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:13.430]  I'm like bullets in a cartridge. You don't fire them, and I'm not saying literally fire bullets, but it's a metaphor, an analogy, an allegory.
[01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:16.430]  Then the gun doesn't fire. We don't win.
[01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:20.430]  You have to aim the information in the direction of people that don't know what's happening.
[01:15:20.430 --> 01:15:24.430]  You have to lovingly wake them up. Tell folks about the broadcast. Pray for the broadcast.
[01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:27.430]  Please, humbly, I ask you. And go to infowarestore.com.
[01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:31.430]  We've got to end it in a couple of days. They're low on the water filters. They have them in stock.
[01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:34.430]  They're low on the air filters. They'll get more in in about a month.
[01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:37.430]  But the sale for 10% off, they're already lowest prices, has to end.
[01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:41.430]  The storable food sale has to end. Infowarestore.com. You need to filter your water.
[01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:45.430]  This is the highest rated system. It'll exapere exclusively 10% off.
[01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:49.430]  Infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:55.430]  And Vitamin Refusion is back in stock, and we're selling out of Turbo Force and Ultimate Bone Broth.

[01:17:50.430 --> 01:17:56.430]  We will find a way. Infowares.com
[01:17:58.430 --> 01:18:03.430]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.

[01:18:58.430 --> 01:19:02.430]  A lot of people have asked me, why is Infowars Store at Infowars Life,

[01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:12.430]  We had a top-maker, top-certified of probiotics for more than seven years.
[01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:15.430]  They got bought by a lip-tard company and said,
[01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:18.430]  we're not doing business with you, Mr. Jones, anymore.
[01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:24.430]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.

[01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:21.230]  What we're talking about here is not just words, it's reality.
[01:20:21.230 --> 01:20:22.230]  We're all under attack.
[01:20:22.230 --> 01:20:27.590]  We have to recognize that and recognize who did it if we're ever going to stop them, because
[01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:36.870]  they're planning new bigger attacks, and they're imminent, and they're ongoing.
[01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:39.510]  It's a raging war on corruption.
[01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:44.230]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:20:44.230 --> 01:20:50.190]  I'm going to go right to your phone calls after I play the Bill Gates clip.
[01:20:50.190 --> 01:20:55.590]  He's like, gee, I don't know why people don't like me and claim I'm a mastermind.
[01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:59.830]  I've just taken over most of the global medical systems and have a year-end treaty to take
[01:20:59.830 --> 01:21:04.830]  control of your body, and I make 22 times the money on the shots, and it's all tax exempt.
[01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:06.750]  Gee, they work so well.
[01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:09.590]  They lie and say they don't work, and they hurt people.
[01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:13.390]  Jiminy crickets, they exaggerate problems.
[01:21:13.390 --> 01:21:16.870]  What happened three years ago before the shots even started on NBC News?
[01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:20.870]  Saying, well, yes, 80 percent get sick when they take it.
[01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:21.870]  Mm-hmm.
[01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:25.510]  You want me to subject you to that clip again?
[01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:27.950]  People think I'm like a mastermind or something.
[01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:28.950]  Here he is.
[01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:37.430]  You know, this was an interesting test of people's trust in their politicians or their
[01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:47.550]  health system, and statistically, we didn't do as well as I would have expected.
[01:21:47.550 --> 01:21:56.110]  In fact, I'm cited as some mastermind of some evil plot in many, many cases, so no, I didn't
[01:21:56.110 --> 01:21:59.070]  expect any of that.
[01:21:59.070 --> 01:22:04.270]  You know, in some ways, the politicization of, you know, taking vaccines and helping
[01:22:04.270 --> 01:22:08.670]  protect other people, you could almost say that's a step backwards.
[01:22:08.670 --> 01:22:18.190]  You know, I hope vaccine acceptance for other diseases like measles is not reduced by this,
[01:22:18.190 --> 01:22:24.950]  but you know, a lot of people jumped in and took the vaccines, but a meaningful minority
[01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:32.110]  in most countries were led down a path of believing that not only, you know, were there
[01:22:32.110 --> 01:22:40.670]  rare side effects, but that the vaccine wasn't properly tested or was part of some evil conspiracy.
[01:22:40.670 --> 01:22:43.950]  So they admit they didn't test it, they admit it didn't work, and there's A.P.
[01:22:43.950 --> 01:22:50.070]  More polio cases now caused by vaccine than by wild virus, A.P., but he thinks you're
[01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:51.070]  an idiot.
[01:22:51.190 --> 01:22:57.590]  All right, we've got Matt, Gerald, Carlos, Warren, Jordan, Kim, Charles, Mike, Craig,
[01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:58.590]  Ron, Michael.
[01:22:58.590 --> 01:23:03.190]  We're going to get to all your calls before Chris Sky comes in the studio next hour.
[01:23:03.190 --> 01:23:07.430]  Let's begin with Matt in Florida, who wants to talk about meat allergies and the shots.
[01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:13.310]  If you watch our report that's on Bandot Video from just Monday, we show the CDC FDA website
[01:23:13.310 --> 01:23:18.830]  where it admits the shots are causing it, not just the COVID.
[01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:19.830]  Go ahead, Matt.
[01:23:19.830 --> 01:23:20.830]  Tell us your view on this.
[01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:21.830]  Hey, Alex, how's it going?
[01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:22.830]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:23.830]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:24.830]  First time being on The Jones Show.
[01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:25.830]  I've called into a couple of the other shows, but this is a great topic.
[01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:26.830]  You know, it's interesting to see Bill Gates.
[01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:27.830]  The guy's a disgrace.
[01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:28.830]  But, you know, this makes you start to think.
[01:23:28.830 --> 01:23:29.830]  I think about a couple of things when you hear about this.
[01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:30.830]  You know, all the livestock deaths that were occurring, you know, not so long ago.
[01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:31.830]  You know, what was that like?
[01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:32.830]  What was it like for you?
[01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:33.830]  What was it like for your family?
[01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:34.830]  What was it like for your friends?
[01:23:34.830 --> 01:23:35.830]  What was it like for your neighbors?
[01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:36.830]  What was it like for you?
[01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:37.830]  What was it like for your neighbors?
[01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:58.510]  And, you know, I was also wanting to ask you, too, what your thoughts were on why is the
[01:23:58.510 --> 01:24:03.870]  nanotech showing up in both the VACs and the non-VACs individuals?
[01:24:03.870 --> 01:24:08.790]  The FDA, two years ago, we covered it, said nanotech has not been ruled on by Congress
[01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:09.790]  or the courts.
[01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:10.790]  There's no laws.
[01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:14.470]  But normally, the FDA and EPA make laws outside of that.
[01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:18.310]  The Supreme Court ruled they can't do it on carbon taxes and the rest of it or carbon
[01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:19.310]  dioxide.
[01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:22.750]  But in the case of nanotech, they said, we have no jurisdiction.
[01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:23.990]  It's all legal.
[01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:29.510]  So big tech companies and big, big pharma and big, big agri are adding God knows what
[01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:30.790]  to everything now.
[01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:34.350]  And suddenly the nanoparticles are being found everywhere that they're with the we're
[01:24:34.350 --> 01:24:35.350]  under attack.
[01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:36.350]  It's a war.
[01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:37.350]  They're not going to hit us with army tanks and troops.
[01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:39.670]  The U.N. is not going to come in blue helmets.
[01:24:39.670 --> 01:24:42.750]  They're going to come with poison shots and 5G and poison food.
[01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:43.750]  Absolutely.
[01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:44.750]  Absolutely.
[01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:49.590]  Well, I mean, I don't take part in the Henrietta cancer meet there, but, you know, the other
[01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:53.750]  thing that I find very interesting here is that you don't hear much about people that
[01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:57.350]  are dying that are unvaccinated.
[01:24:57.350 --> 01:25:01.490]  You hear a lot about people that are passing out, you know, dropping dead left and right
[01:25:01.490 --> 01:25:02.490]  here and that.
[01:25:02.490 --> 01:25:03.490]  Are they vaccinated?
[01:25:03.490 --> 01:25:04.490]  Are they vaccinated?
[01:25:04.490 --> 01:25:05.830]  You know, that's the big question.
[01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:06.830]  You don't hear about anybody.
[01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:07.830]  Oh, wow.
[01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:11.550]  You know, Bob, the neighbor, you know, he wasn't vaccinated.
[01:25:11.550 --> 01:25:13.110]  You know, he's not here anymore.
[01:25:13.110 --> 01:25:14.350]  Oh, he should have took him.
[01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:15.350]  No, no.
[01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:16.850]  You only hear about people that took the shot and died.
[01:25:16.850 --> 01:25:20.790]  But major studies in the U.K., the U.S., you name it, the shedding is real.
[01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:21.790]  It's happening.
[01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:24.470]  It's just not as bad as when you take the shot itself.
[01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:26.590]  So this is a disaster of disasters.
[01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:27.830]  Thank you for the call.
[01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:30.830]  Let's take another call on meat allergies and the vaccines.
[01:25:30.830 --> 01:25:31.830]  Jordan in New Jersey.
[01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:32.830]  Thanks for calling.
[01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:33.830]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:34.830]  Jordan here from CoronaEyes.com.
[01:25:34.830 --> 01:25:35.830]  I've been calling over the last couple of years, talking about my wife's side effects.
[01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:36.830]  And this is something I noticed and that the report just kind of hit at the same time
[01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:37.830]  I started to notice it.
[01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:38.830]  My wife doesn't eat meat at all anymore.
[01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:39.830]  She took the Moderna and had all the other side effects, had heart palpitations, all
[01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:40.830]  the neurological effects, which is mostly neurological.
[01:25:40.830 --> 01:26:01.470]  But she doesn't eat meat, doesn't have her steak, won't eat it, and just upsets her stomach
[01:26:01.470 --> 01:26:02.470]  now.
[01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:06.750]  So I'm just, you know, this is my observation, but as you know, I've been studying this for
[01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:07.750]  a long time.
[01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:12.030]  You've called the last couple of years and four or five times, you said you directly
[01:26:12.030 --> 01:26:13.030]  work for Big Pharma.
[01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:14.030]  I did.
[01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:15.030]  Two major companies.
[01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:20.690]  And so I thought I started my own site and all the nanotech stuff that you've also been
[01:26:20.690 --> 01:26:21.690]  recently discussing.
[01:26:21.690 --> 01:26:22.790]  I have a whole site on it.
[01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:30.070]  I urge everybody to go to it's all clinically, clinical papers, advanced research on nanotech
[01:26:30.070 --> 01:26:35.070]  called, You've been CoronaEyes, that's the nanotech take over the human cell.
[01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:37.830]  But there's also DNA and stuff in these shots too.
[01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:41.750]  And it's slowly mutating the human race.
[01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:45.710]  And so I think vaccines, the whole modern vaccination programs and aim at that as well.
[01:26:45.710 --> 01:26:50.210]  So it's like the new, the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie, they're literally mutating
[01:26:50.210 --> 01:26:51.210]  our evolution.
[01:26:51.210 --> 01:26:52.210]  Exactly.
[01:26:52.210 --> 01:26:56.190]  And just like Harari says, this is intelligence designed by us.
[01:26:56.190 --> 01:26:58.790]  They mean that and people have to wake up and understand that.
[01:26:58.790 --> 01:27:03.950]  He says in the future, we will be under your skin and control you very easily.
[01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:04.950]  Yes.
[01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:09.150]  And so this is the nanotech takeover of the human cell, you know, in many ways.
[01:27:09.150 --> 01:27:13.070]  Well, slowly give us your website because your phone's always a little muffled, but
[01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:14.070]  your points are great.
[01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:15.070]  I've looked at your site before.
[01:27:15.070 --> 01:27:16.790]  What's the name of the site?
[01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:19.070]  It's called You've been CoronaEyes.
[01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:28.670]  It's at www.coronaeyes.com.
[01:27:28.670 --> 01:27:29.670]  Everybody can wake up.
[01:27:29.670 --> 01:27:31.670]  Who hasn't woken up already.
[01:27:31.670 --> 01:27:32.670]  CoronaEyes.com.
[01:27:32.670 --> 01:27:33.670]  Yeah, CoronaEyes.
[01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:39.030]  Just like humanized rats, CoronaEyes, which, you know, my theory is that, you know, everybody's
[01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:40.030]  been CoronaEyes.
[01:27:40.030 --> 01:27:41.030]  Can we pull this website up, guys?
[01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:45.150]  Or if you were having trouble crew hearing what he's saying, put him on hold and get
[01:27:45.150 --> 01:27:46.150]  it right now.
[01:27:46.150 --> 01:27:47.150]  We'll put it on screen.
[01:27:47.150 --> 01:27:48.150]  Get him on hold.
[01:27:48.150 --> 01:27:49.150]  Put it up, please.
[01:27:49.150 --> 01:27:50.150]  Yeah.
[01:27:50.150 --> 01:27:51.150]  I looked at your site like the second time you called in about it.
[01:27:51.150 --> 01:27:52.150]  Very interesting.
[01:27:52.150 --> 01:27:53.150]  Yeah.
[01:27:53.150 --> 01:27:54.150]  I mean, this is a revolution.
[01:27:54.150 --> 01:27:59.910]  They're hitting you with electromagnetic radiation, GMOs, chemtrailing, nanotech, poison shots,
[01:27:59.910 --> 01:28:01.910]  spike protein crystals.
[01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:02.910]  You see the mass death.
[01:28:03.150 --> 01:28:06.070]  You see the insurance companies showing live expectancies plunging.
[01:28:06.070 --> 01:28:07.070]  This is it.
[01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:08.070]  We're being murdered slowly.
[01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:09.070]  And I know it's terrible.
[01:28:09.070 --> 01:28:13.670]  I know it's horrible, but it's the reality.
[01:28:13.670 --> 01:28:19.630]  So whether you are an auto mechanic or a farmer or a rancher or a shopkeeper or an insurance
[01:28:19.630 --> 01:28:26.910]  salesman or a police officer or in the military or a lawyer or a paralegal, it doesn't matter
[01:28:26.910 --> 01:28:31.630]  whether you're a masseuse, whether you're a grocery checker, you're under attack.
[01:28:31.630 --> 01:28:35.910]  You can pretend you're not because it's not a big frontal assault and your brain sees
[01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:39.470]  all the movies, entertainment, Mission Impossible, like, oh, there's all this action.
[01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:41.830]  Your brain sees that as real and thinks that's what's important.
[01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:45.650]  Meanwhile, the covert attack is taking place.
[01:28:45.650 --> 01:28:48.110]  The nanotech takeover of the human cell.
[01:28:48.110 --> 01:28:49.110]  Well said.
[01:28:49.110 --> 01:28:50.670]  You have done well.

[01:29:45.190 --> 01:29:46.670]  That's what the debanking is about.
[01:29:46.670 --> 01:29:48.470]  That's what the financial attacks are about.

[01:35:58.040 --> 01:35:59.040]  Here's the Epic Times.
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:04.040]  Monkey Virus DNA found in COVID-19 shots.
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:07.040]  It's all in the studies and the literature.
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:11.040]  Microbiologist Kevin McCracken, a former researcher and team leader, for the MIT Human
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:17.040]  Genome Project discovered massive DNA contamination in mRNA COVID-19
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:18.540]  shots including Simienvirus-40.
[01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:28.500]  but you're good loving liberal when Sergei Brin was on with Klaus Schwab a
[01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:33.019]  few weeks ago calling for an end to elections but I would no longer need
[01:36:33.019 --> 01:36:37.300]  elections AI will tell you who your leaders are Sergei Brin's wearing like a
[01:36:37.300 --> 01:36:43.260]  pink shirt or a purple shirt he's like mm-hmm I'm a liberal also let me just
[01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:49.540]  slip this dagger into your kidneys I'm liberal though I'm not threatening I'm a
[01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:59.860]  geek nerd building such a beautiful world for us giving you the cancer
[01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:06.900]  viruses a cocktail of death all whatever ways to kill you so many ways to murder
[01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:16.019]  you so many ways to do almost think it's more effective than I even do this show
[01:37:16.019 --> 01:37:18.300]  anymore though I'm gonna continue doing this we're on a lot of radio stations
[01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:22.860]  when I just shoot a 10-minute report on all these different so-called vaccines
[01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:25.780]  that cause the beef allergy and meat allergies and I show you the mainstream
[01:37:25.780 --> 01:37:29.099]  documents it gets millions of years and this show gets millions of viewers but
[01:37:29.099 --> 01:37:32.900]  it's just kind of such a huge thing I just mentioned spent two minutes on that
[01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:38.580]  but as big as it gets cancer viruses in the shots confirmed scanned multiple
[01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:43.300]  governments confirm and all these major in scientific research facilities then
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:51.019]  we just spent two minutes on it's like oh that crazy guy up there and think of
[01:37:51.019 --> 01:37:53.900]  the folks that just trust the government and trust the system because it's a
[01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:56.980]  religion and they roll the little sleeves up and wonder why they get
[01:37:56.980 --> 01:38:02.660]  cancer six months later let's go back to your phone calls we're gonna go on the
[01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:07.500]  order these calls have been received Michael in California thanks for
[01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:12.460]  holding your on the air I Alex I just want to first tell you that we love you
[01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:19.940]  and you're like a part of the family um about seven years ago well I should say
[01:38:19.940 --> 01:38:23.139]  that I've grown up here in Hollywood around these people in the entertainment
[01:38:23.139 --> 01:38:29.780]  industry and I guess after I got into it with them they had something put into my
[01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:37.980]  food and it hit me like like like one of these bioweapons about about eight
[01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:41.700]  years ago I was in a sushi place I had like one vodka soda didn't even have a
[01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:47.540]  buzz literally had to be helped back to home passed out I don't remember getting
[01:38:47.540 --> 01:38:51.380]  there so I mean I did but yeah it's not just government groups that poison
[01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:58.900]  people yeah they've been using this not only to torture me it's it's um it's a
[01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:03.500]  massive criminal network that they can target you wherever they need to and the
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:08.219]  people that are doing the surveilling your handlers they're the ones directing
[01:39:08.219 --> 01:39:12.900]  these people that are everywhere something allegedly that um two thousand
[01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:17.180]  mules was showing that these people were being directed by whoever was on their
[01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:20.900]  phone telling them what to do and there's definitely giant criminal
[01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:24.980]  networks Facebook set that up to steal the election I appreciate your call sir
[01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:30.540]  let's go ahead now and take another call let's talk to Craig in Ohio you're
[01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:35.940]  on the air hey Alex you know when you get to a place where words just aren't
[01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:40.099]  enough to describe what you're seeing yeah I think we surpassed that point a
[01:39:40.099 --> 01:39:44.460]  long time ago okay good good good all right so I've called him before I've
[01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:49.180]  traded all major markets through all the black swan events the past 25 years do
[01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:53.580]  me a favor just back off your phone a little bit okay that better yeah go ahead
[01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:58.219]  okay good so through that through 90,000 hours of watching these markets
[01:39:58.219 --> 01:40:05.139]  I've learned to you know see a signal right and then watch the events unfold
[01:40:05.139 --> 01:40:10.460]  and what I've been seeing over the last couple weeks is as crazy as I've ever
[01:40:10.460 --> 01:40:14.860]  seen in these markets and like I said I've been in this for you know 30 years
[01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:19.460]  and all the black swan events you can think of over that time so I think these
[01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:25.340]  globalists are up to something you know that's an understatement I think the
[01:40:25.340 --> 01:40:28.180]  globalists are up to something yeah they're they're up to collapsing
[01:40:28.180 --> 01:40:32.840]  civilization well let me be more specific right you know so before COVID
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:36.380]  right I could see it through the you know through the repo crisis I could
[01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:40.340]  see the trading pick up I could see the repo crisis coming to play and then
[01:40:40.340 --> 01:40:43.860]  COVID came right on the heels of that so I'm trying to I mean I guess I should be
[01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:47.900]  more specific like that right so you know we're seeing movements in the
[01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:51.860]  NASDAQ here these guys are exposing themselves right I've built this model
[01:40:51.860 --> 01:40:54.900]  that's able to you know find the structure of markets right I mean it's
[01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:58.700]  it's unbelievably accurate they'll tell you you can't predict markets but that's
[01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:03.059]  BS right you know so I'll leave it at that but the point is when you can see
[01:41:03.059 --> 01:41:06.780]  these levels come into play and you can see what they're up to you can see how
[01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:10.940]  they work around these levels I think these levels are God-given harmonic
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:15.380]  level vibration things that just go on in the world that we may or may not even
[01:41:15.380 --> 01:41:19.700]  know about yet right but and they can't be broken right but these guys do
[01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:24.580]  everything they can to manipulate around these levels right and I'm seeing it
[01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:27.820]  more than I've ever seen it well you're right I wasn't fooling you by saying
[01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:30.219]  yeah they're up to something I was saying this understatement there is the
[01:41:30.219 --> 01:41:34.700]  invisible hand of Adam Smith and and they admit they have real trouble because
[01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:37.660]  every time they suppress something it makes something else blow up that they
[01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:43.860]  didn't control because things are so complex yeah so you know I guess the big
[01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:47.420]  thing is you know I've you know you develop something and you kind of keep
[01:41:47.420 --> 01:41:51.540]  it to yourself right but I'm at the point where this is I mean this is for
[01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:55.420]  real you know just like what I'm saying is what you're seeing now in the markets
[01:41:55.420 --> 01:42:02.980]  what does that point towards well again you know well two things I either think
[01:42:02.980 --> 01:42:06.180]  they're in trouble and they're on the run and they're trying to extract their
[01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:09.460]  money before everybody else because the way they normally play this game right if
[01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:13.260]  they use other people's money all this wrapped up 401k money that they've
[01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:17.180]  suckered us all into putting out there for them to use at their disposal they
[01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:20.340]  go into private equity and then they pump all this money in the Vanguard
[01:42:20.340 --> 01:42:23.980]  BlackRock State Street all this you know all the usual suspects and they come in
[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:27.500]  like a plunger and they plunge their private equity investment so they get in
[01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:31.660]  first they get out first right and they leave everybody else to hold with the
[01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:36.540]  hang holding the bag at the end right that's how it works right so you know
[01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:42.740]  head down that well I won't go into that but the point is you know the the you
[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:48.540]  know that it's either that or they're plotting something here you know it's
[01:42:48.540 --> 01:42:51.620]  one of the two either they're on their way out or they've got something cooking
[01:42:51.620 --> 01:42:55.860]  because they're putting big money at these markets and it's summertime this
[01:42:55.860 --> 01:42:58.820]  is normally time where they're out in the Mediterranean or they're out on the
[01:42:58.820 --> 01:43:02.860]  boat right these people are playing for keeps right now I'm just saying this is
[01:43:02.860 --> 01:43:08.700]  very unusual behavior right and I guess what I'm what I'm what I'd like to be
[01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:13.260]  able to do it you just can't find the right venue is you know how do I show
[01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:16.660]  this to people because you know just like we did you know to Anheuser-Busch
[01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:21.700]  just like we did you know back in the day to you know the AMC you know movie
[01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:26.620]  theaters and I mean the people have the power it's always been that way but if
[01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:31.620]  we can't unite we're useless right you have the platform you know Crowder has
[01:43:31.620 --> 01:43:35.300]  the platform I mean is there any way that we can start to show people that
[01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:39.860]  so that we're just missing a major document why don't you do a YouTube
[01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:43.500]  video or something with your graphs and give us your tag and specifically say
[01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:50.900]  what you think's about to happen real briefly what do you make of the the
[01:43:50.900 --> 01:44:00.940]  devaluing of the US debt to double-a well you know the question is well okay
[01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:04.700]  so I think they already had that they already knew that ahead of time they knew
[01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:08.740]  that was going to be released they'd already pre-positioned for it great and
[01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:12.980]  then they released it you know no surprise I mean the AP polls are such a
[01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:16.620]  scam they've been that way increasingly over the last 10 years so you know
[01:44:16.620 --> 01:44:19.940]  before something happens it's almost like they send it out to their bud well
[01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:23.820]  sure black rocks and we deserve it send me some info sir I appreciate your call
[01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:27.860]  all right let's go ahead and talk to the next caller here everybody in here as
[01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:32.019]  fast as we can let's go to Warren in Idaho then Carlos Warren you're on the
[01:44:32.019 --> 01:44:37.219]  air hey Alex can you hear me okay I can thanks for calling thank you so much
[01:44:37.219 --> 01:44:41.780]  for taking my call I'm a pastor Alex out in Idaho we our church never closed
[01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:45.620]  during the pandemic we were threatened and all that but we never closed I want
[01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:50.540]  to give you my testimony on I believe I was vaccine shed on back in September
[01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:56.500]  2021 never like I said never took the vaccine I was watching TV and the next
[01:44:56.500 --> 01:45:00.580]  thing you know I have blurred vision and double vision in my left eye never had
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:03.940]  anything like that before so to make a long story short I know you're pressed
[01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:09.820]  for time I've had I had through a series of time I had the MRI to see if I've
[01:45:09.820 --> 01:45:13.340]  had a stroke carotid artery to see if I've had a stroke you know all those
[01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:18.099]  things never smoked ever drank in my life so healthy healthy male why then do
[01:45:18.099 --> 01:45:22.380]  I get my eye going crazy so I have to wear a patch for about seven months over
[01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:26.380]  my eye I go online because I know I'm thinking outside the box I know my
[01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:30.420]  regular eyed ophthalmologist says oh we'll give you some some inverted lenses
[01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:33.740]  and you'll be able to see again well that doesn't help anything so I found a
[01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:39.500]  gal in Chicago dr. Julie Steinauer paid 150 bucks for a consultation over zoom
[01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:44.700]  and here's first question she asked so so Warren did you take the vaccine I
[01:45:44.700 --> 01:45:50.820]  said no never she said you were shed on she says my my office is inundated this
[01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:54.139]  is in the Chicago area somewhere my office is inundated with people having
[01:45:54.139 --> 01:45:59.460]  strokes and going blind and I think she let me and she was she was a very very
[01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:03.380]  busy gal but knowing that I was a pastor she gave me some priority paid
[01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:08.860]  some big bucks anyway so I had to rehab my eye back I believe I have a military
[01:46:08.860 --> 01:46:12.260]  surplus store besides being a pastor I believe the best we can figure somebody
[01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:16.580]  came in I had close contact with them right after they got the you know the
[01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:22.580]  vaccination and so that's that's a story about being shut on brother well I
[01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:26.380]  believe I was I believe my dad and mom was Rob do was it almost killed him
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:30.700]  almost killed my dad none of us took the shot and but I mean we know there's
[01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:34.059]  different ways it does it by them giving all those so-called shots during the
[01:46:34.059 --> 01:46:39.980]  quote pandemic it made the virus mutate it made you know more work spreadable
[01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:43.500]  forms of it but we have a whole bunch of studies again a new one came out by
[01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:48.420]  Colorado University last week confirming massive shedding from the
[01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:54.620]  Pfizer and Moderna shot it is so diabolical brother yeah yeah yeah so
[01:46:54.620 --> 01:46:58.660]  they just have the people seek out alternative sources hey by the way we
[01:46:58.660 --> 01:47:04.400]  are big supporters of the store one of my favorites is a brain force I always
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:08.180]  take a dropper of brain force before I preach about an hour before I preach I
[01:47:08.180 --> 01:47:11.059]  take a dropper of brain force just give my you know my a little bit of an edge
[01:47:11.059 --> 01:47:17.660]  there when I'm preaching so you like you like brain force ultra yeah yes thank
[01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:20.860]  you sir this brain for whatever it is it's I just I just read brain force so I

[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:24.320]  God bless and in your in your projects I hear there are many good changes coming
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:30.360]  along and I hope that I caught like crazy because that's the way to go. Yes
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:37.080]  sir. Alex you mentioned a couple of times the word discernment and you left it
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:42.559]  like a dying participle you know what is discernment you have a clip also from a
[01:48:42.559 --> 01:48:46.599]  video movie where a fellow puts on a pair of glasses and he can see things
[01:48:46.599 --> 01:48:52.280]  that when he takes the glasses off are not evident usually they're their lies
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:57.040]  discernment is something that your previous scholar just before mentioned
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:01.200]  he after many years being in the in the trading market he can see patterns and
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:06.320]  things and in the field of cognitive psychology which is my strength the
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:11.200]  discernment I even experienced myself a person looking at a Gansfeld which is
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:21.000]  like a random noise on a screen can see in one hundredth of a second can see a
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:28.480]  pattern they're symmetrical people that are experienced in x-ray pictures of
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:33.719]  bones and broken and so on can detect things within milliseconds that are as
[01:49:33.719 --> 01:49:38.519]  accurate as whether they look at it for seconds even minutes later. My dad's a
[01:49:38.519 --> 01:49:41.360]  dentist and oral surgeon ever when I was a kid if you look at x-rays and he go you
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:45.480]  see that he'd see a crack I couldn't see and I've seen other doctors saying you
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:48.719]  know when I've had broken bones or fractures I can't see it they go don't
[01:49:48.719 --> 01:49:51.960]  you see it don't you see it then finally they blow it up and I can see it it's
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:56.120]  because their eyes are trained to see it. You got it not trained it's called
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:50:03.280]  cognitive discernment and you sir you have it I have it too so did people in
[01:50:03.719 --> 01:50:10.080]  history they had it it comes after having 10,000 hours of doing something
[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:14.559]  you begin to integrate it and then you begin to see things that other people
[01:50:14.559 --> 01:50:19.040]  don't see and people like Mozart and so on are able to do incredible things where
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:23.080]  others couldn't. Why am I telling you this? Because when you hear someone like
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:28.160]  Sergey Brin saying you don't need to have let's say any more elections
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:32.320]  because of artificial intelligence well the first thing that comes to me is it's
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:38.320]  clear okay how do you make 30 billion dollars 30 trillion dollars disappear how
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:42.400]  well you get everybody to go into electronic money and then you have a
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:48.840]  six-month power failure. Absolutely and they also tell you AI is God so let it
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:53.040]  make the decisions it's already told you that you're worthless you're an animal
[01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:55.880]  you don't have a soul and the next thing is you don't need to vote I mean it's
[01:50:55.880 --> 01:51:00.719]  just you will eat bugs it's all selling dystopia thinking that it's so
[01:51:00.719 --> 01:51:04.200]  outrageous we'll just rationalize it and accept it because we don't want to
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:07.320]  fight back against it even though submitting is a thousand times worse
[01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:14.559]  than fighting back. And discernment gives you the ability to have a 35,000 foot
[01:51:14.559 --> 01:51:19.080]  view which you have mentioned many times now InfoWars is bringing about
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:23.799]  collective discernment you don't realize this but over the years you have been
[01:51:23.799 --> 01:51:27.480]  enlightening people to see things that they wouldn't have otherwise have seen
[01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:32.200]  for instance when I mentioned to you the other day there was a hidden monarch
[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:39.480]  which was able to through the power of owning such colossal portfolios to have
[01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:44.960]  hundreds of thousands of money managers control companies to maximum profit
[01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:50.080]  regardless of how fake the techniques are you end up wondering like I wonder
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:55.880]  why is Pfizer and Moderna not under trusteeship these are enemies of
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:52:00.880]  society these are these are why because you don't have the discernment until
[01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:04.880]  the time comes and it goes critical mass and then people will start saying hey
[01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:08.440]  wait a second companies are supposed to sell widgets they're not supposed to run
[01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:12.059]  countries and that's what we're at the threshold that's why InfoWars is
[01:52:12.059 --> 01:52:15.799]  bringing us to the threshold of discernment and that's the point I want
[01:52:15.799 --> 01:52:20.519]  to make one day we may talk about it longer Alex. Well that's interesting we
[01:52:20.519 --> 01:52:22.920]  just pulled up the definition to cognitive discernment maybe we can do it
[01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:27.160]  again but once you get enough of the historical pieces and common sense and
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:30.519]  and what's going on the world you begin to see things but so much of it is
[01:52:30.519 --> 01:52:34.600]  people get hit by tyranny and they'd rather brush themselves off and ignore
[01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:38.120]  it because they think well they can't change it so they just decide it doesn't
[01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:44.000]  exist that they cognitively engage in cognitive dissent or or learned
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.240]  helplessness or mass Stockholm syndrome the term I coined instead of cognitive
[01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:52.760]  discernment the skill of intentionally understanding the greater truth to make
[01:52:52.840 --> 01:52:57.639]  predictive decisions the ability and skill to prepare and create what is yet
[01:52:57.639 --> 01:53:03.760]  to come is discernment. That's right and someone like Charles de Gaulle had
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:08.480]  discernment because if you look at what he mentioned about the UK US
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:13.480]  Atlanticist and power over Europe he predicted exactly what is happening
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:17.600]  today and he tried to avoid it he tried to prevent it. Well that's what the British
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:20.519]  Empire did is it merged with America and then created this global system not to
[01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:25.559]  empower America the UK or anybody but to slay everybody. It's run from the city of
[01:53:25.559 --> 01:53:31.200]  London and it's those international huge portfolios that are controlled by you
[01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:37.719]  know who the you know what is this hidden monarch and what the will of the
[01:53:37.719 --> 01:53:42.080]  monarch expresses it's carried out by all these minions without all over the world
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:45.960]  without realizing that they're really following the directive. I'm not a
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:51.200]  monarch like a clown on in wearing you know the crown and all this pomp and
[01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:55.559]  circumstance. I'm talking about the portfolio managers who manage their huge
[01:53:55.559 --> 01:54:00.600]  colossal portfolio that has been accumulated over the years. The secret
[01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:05.960]  silent if you want to call it monarch. Now monarchs have been silent and secret
[01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:11.639]  for many many generations. I mean as early as Alfonso XII in Spain he would
[01:54:11.639 --> 01:54:14.639]  walk among the people and would never realize people never asked he was the
[01:54:14.639 --> 01:54:20.160]  king of Spain because nobody saw the king nobody saw the monarch but the
[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:24.600]  monarch today and the way that people behave under the will of the monarch is
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:30.040]  really what you are beginning to point out in in Infowars and you're bringing
[01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:35.240]  the people to discernment and hopefully you will continue forever as long as you
[01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:40.000]  live Alex. Well God bless you Carlos great points. All right we got Chris Sky
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:43.240]  is he in the building yet? I'm excited about this I've never met him in person
[01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:47.440]  really look forward to it. He is great. He's coming in at 5 after let's keep
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:55.040]  taking calls here. Who's up next? That would be Ron in Arizona. Ron you're on
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:55:01.960]  the air go ahead. Well hello Alex Jones and hello to all the millions of humans
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:08.040]  listening and you know Alex I think I have an answer. I have a hypothesis of
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:16.200]  why there's so much death you know on the horizon. Here it is. Humans are not
[01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:20.920]  the smartest creatures on the planet we're just the best killers on the
[01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:27.760]  planet. Humans can kill bears, humans can kill lions, tigers but yet whales are
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:32.719]  smarter. They use sonar, birds use gravitational waves to navigate
[01:55:32.719 --> 01:55:37.160]  thousands of miles, ants use their antennae. You know they may be way more
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:42.160]  intelligent, way more smarter but we're the best killers. That explains the
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:49.000]  wars, why there's a drive for the end to humanity, why you know even abortion. We
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:55.240]  kill our own birth you know. What do you think of that theory that humans are not
[01:55:55.240 --> 01:56:00.000]  the smartest? The globalists call us killer apes I'm not saying we're apes
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:06.600]  but I would say for all different types of complex knowledge and information we
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:09.559]  are the smartest because we can build our own environments. We create
[01:56:09.559 --> 01:56:13.880]  incredible art, literature, culture, mathematical equations. We also have
[01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:17.000]  magnetic connections in our brain. We just are in modern times aren't
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:23.840]  conscious of it as much as say a duck or an ant is or a fish or a whale, a mammal,
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:30.840]  a marine mammal but we have incredible highs and incredible lows. So I think you
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:34.400]  know a killer whales highs are amazing but its lows are you know kind of close
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:38.519]  to that. It's not doing that much complex stuff other than you know what
[01:56:38.519 --> 01:56:42.880]  it's doing, picking up the sonar and singing and but they're very similar to
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:47.960]  us in many ways. They're just on a different arc, a different path. So I
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:52.400]  mean I think it's I mean I think we are actually great lovers and great
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:58.120]  builders and great killers and I think we're very powerful so we when we do
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:03.719]  something wrong it's manifested a much greater way. We've risen to the top by
[01:57:03.719 --> 01:57:07.519]  being the greatest killer. Maybe I should say we can kill a whale. I wouldn't even say but I mean you
[01:57:07.519 --> 01:57:12.200]  don't see whales building ships or whales building aircraft or wells you
[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:16.000]  know I mean I think I think I mean I think it's not just that we're killers
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:19.400]  but I do think in primitive times because we had more advanced
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:22.639]  intelligence with tool making and teamwork that we were able to stop
[01:57:22.639 --> 01:57:27.480]  saber-toothed tigers and cave bears and woolly mammoths and then what and then
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:31.000]  the only other predator we have the only other challenge we have is apex predators
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:36.240]  so because there is no other predator against us really we have to create
[01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:39.960]  another apex predator against ourselves the globalists believe under social
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:43.519]  Darwinism they are the apex predator they're actually entering the space to
[01:57:43.519 --> 01:57:47.880]  bring equilibrium to things. Let's talk about that when we come back.
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:53.559]  For everything the globalists hit us with God through Mother Nature has given
[01:57:53.559 --> 01:57:58.200]  us the answer. I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum CBD oil, the

[01:59:57.710 --> 02:00:12.350]  I meant to hold that last caller over.
[02:00:12.350 --> 02:00:13.350]  That's a whole show debate.
[02:00:13.350 --> 02:00:14.350]  I appreciate him calling.
[02:00:14.350 --> 02:00:16.390]  He made a really good point.
[02:00:16.390 --> 02:00:20.670]  We should debate why humans are the most powerful creature on this planet that we know of.
[02:00:20.670 --> 02:00:23.910]  Made in the image of God.
[02:00:23.910 --> 02:00:26.910]  I mean, I think my analysis was dead on, but we can have a debate.
[02:00:26.910 --> 02:00:29.270]  I think his points were well taken.
[02:00:29.270 --> 02:00:32.670]  Let's go to the next caller, Gerald in South Carolina.
[02:00:32.670 --> 02:00:33.670]  Thanks for calling.
[02:00:33.670 --> 02:00:34.670]  Hey, Alex.
[02:00:34.670 --> 02:00:35.670]  How are you?
[02:00:35.670 --> 02:00:36.670]  I'm all right, brother.
[02:00:36.670 --> 02:00:37.670]  Okay.
[02:00:37.670 --> 02:00:44.550]  So the vision that I've been having about this shot, it starts out where they're manufacturing
[02:00:44.550 --> 02:00:48.870]  the vials that they constantly show on TV.
[02:00:48.870 --> 02:00:52.870]  You see the little blue thing in the center where they put the needle through, reminds
[02:00:52.870 --> 02:00:56.510]  me of a primer on a gun, on a bullet on a gun.
[02:00:57.110 --> 02:01:01.390]  Next stage of the vision, AR.
[02:01:01.390 --> 02:01:07.110]  It morphs into the needle, the real assault weapon.
[02:01:07.110 --> 02:01:09.630]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:09.630 --> 02:01:14.510]  That's, that's it.
[02:01:14.510 --> 02:01:15.510]  That's the vision I've been having.
[02:01:15.510 --> 02:01:20.030]  Well, the crew just brought me this CDC document I'll cover with Chris Sky, where they admit
[02:01:20.030 --> 02:01:22.830]  the simian monkey virus in the shots.
[02:01:22.830 --> 02:01:25.030]  And then I've got Google saying it doesn't exist.
[02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:27.030]  It's aiding and abetting murder.
[02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:29.030]  These people are killing us with information.
[02:01:29.030 --> 02:01:30.030]  Amen.
[02:01:30.030 --> 02:01:31.750]  Pisses me off, man.
[02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:33.150]  I mean, these are creeps.
[02:01:33.150 --> 02:01:35.710]  These are eugenicists that think we're animals and are here to die.
[02:01:35.710 --> 02:01:39.830]  Well, I got news for Sergey Brin and Larry Page.
[02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:41.030]  You're going to pay for what you've done.
[02:01:41.030 --> 02:01:44.030]  I appreciate your call, Gerald.
[02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:44.750]  Murderers.
[02:01:45.330 --> 02:01:59.170]  Alex, Peto Peter is the child catcher off of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang sniffing out the
[02:01:59.170 --> 02:02:00.170]  kids.
[02:02:00.170 --> 02:02:04.690]  I gotta be honest with you, I'm not making out what you're saying.
[02:02:04.690 --> 02:02:06.250]  It's a very old phone, I'm sorry.
[02:02:06.250 --> 02:02:13.330]  Peto Peter, Joe Biden, is the child catcher off of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang sniffing out
[02:02:13.330 --> 02:02:14.330]  the kids.
[02:02:14.330 --> 02:02:15.330]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:02:15.330 --> 02:02:18.450]  I've heard of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, but I don't know what it is.
[02:02:18.450 --> 02:02:25.010]  Oh, he's a child catcher, and he sniffs the kids, and he captures them all in town and
[02:02:25.010 --> 02:02:30.330]  collects them in the caves, and he's, that's, it's Joe Biden.
[02:02:30.330 --> 02:02:31.330]  You gotta check it out.
[02:02:31.330 --> 02:02:34.530]  Wow, so I've heard the term Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, but I didn't know what it was.
[02:02:34.530 --> 02:02:39.490]  That's some kind of, is that like a fairy tale or something about a gremlin or something?
[02:02:39.490 --> 02:02:44.030]  Yep, it's where Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious came from.
[02:02:44.030 --> 02:02:48.670]  You said it the other day, and I thought, oh, he's gonna get it, and you didn't, and
[02:02:48.670 --> 02:02:49.670]  I thought, oh.
[02:02:49.670 --> 02:02:55.190]  Guys, give me the etymology of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
[02:02:55.190 --> 02:02:56.190]  I believe you.
[02:02:56.190 --> 02:02:58.830]  I just don't know about it, so enlighten me.
[02:02:58.830 --> 02:03:01.030]  You learn something new all the time.
[02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:07.110]  Oh, and he sneaks around, and he collects all the kids, and they try to hide the kids
[02:03:07.110 --> 02:03:12.350]  from him, and he keeps them in a dungeon, and he's got this big nose, and he sniffs them
[02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:15.710]  out like Biden does when he sniffs kids.
[02:03:15.710 --> 02:03:16.710]  Wow.
[02:03:16.710 --> 02:03:22.110]  You know, most of those wives' tales and things have a basis in reality, like Little Red Riding
[02:03:22.110 --> 02:03:23.110]  Hood.
[02:03:23.110 --> 02:03:24.110]  I guess they found him.
[02:03:24.110 --> 02:03:25.910]  It says Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
[02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:30.230]  He kind of looks like Biden, and Little Red Riding Hood's like, hey, when you walk to
[02:03:30.230 --> 02:03:33.750]  Grandma's house, watch out for a man that poses as a woman, just like the pedophiles
[02:03:33.750 --> 02:03:34.750]  now.
[02:03:34.750 --> 02:03:35.750]  Yep.
[02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:36.750]  Yep.
[02:03:36.750 --> 02:03:38.590]  Well, thank you so much.
[02:03:38.590 --> 02:03:41.430]  Tell me more about Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
[02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:48.950]  Um, it's a fairy tale with a dad and his wife dies, and then he meets a rich woman, and
[02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:55.710]  then he makes candy, and they fly off in this imaginary car that they build, and then they
[02:03:55.710 --> 02:04:04.070]  land in this other world, and there, there's no kids, and they brought two kids with them,
[02:04:04.070 --> 02:04:08.550]  so they're like looking for the kids, because they could start smelling them and people,
[02:04:08.550 --> 02:04:13.950]  and then they had to disguise the kids, and a toy maker helps them, and he takes the kids
[02:04:13.950 --> 02:04:18.590]  and hides them in a basement, and the child catcher comes in, and he's sniffing for them,
[02:04:18.590 --> 02:04:24.990]  and he knows they're there, and at the end, they get all the kids out, and they free the
[02:04:24.990 --> 02:04:29.550]  kids, and then they fly back to the real world.
[02:04:29.550 --> 02:04:30.550]  Wow.
[02:04:30.550 --> 02:04:31.550]  Man, I tell you.
[02:04:31.550 --> 02:04:33.390]  In the meanwhile, that's Joe Biden.
[02:04:33.390 --> 02:04:34.390]  Incredible call, Kim.
[02:04:34.390 --> 02:04:35.390]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:36.390 --> 02:04:37.390]  We're going to break.
[02:04:37.390 --> 02:04:40.390]  Chris Sky in studio will take more of your calls as well.
[02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:42.390]  Leah, Jim, Frank, Steve, and Henry.
[02:04:42.390 --> 02:04:44.390]  No more calls after them, but keep them on hold.
[02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:46.390]  We'll get to them with the great Chris Sky.
[02:04:46.390 --> 02:04:48.390]  He'll be hosting the fourth hour today as well.
[02:04:48.390 --> 02:04:49.390]  Wow.
[02:04:49.390 --> 02:04:53.390]  So much we learned from history, both fiction and mainline history.
[02:04:53.390 --> 02:04:54.390]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:54.390 --> 02:04:55.390]  Yippee-ki-yay.
[02:04:58.390 --> 02:05:03.390]  Tell us about the products, how we support you, how we support all of ourselves, and
[02:05:03.390 --> 02:05:04.390]  the big event coming up.
[02:05:05.390 --> 02:05:10.390]  Well, yeah, the first one, obviously, you can go to MyPillow.com, use that promo code
[02:05:10.390 --> 02:05:14.390]  Alex, and you can get all these great discounts on all of our products.
[02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:20.390]  And just by visiting this site, you're going to get a $20 free gift emailed to you immediately.

[02:05:25.390 --> 02:05:29.390]  1998 for the queen size, normally $69.98.
[02:05:29.390 --> 02:05:34.390]  We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love to invest, producing and
[02:05:34.390 --> 02:05:35.390]  making the MyPillow.
[02:05:35.390 --> 02:05:43.390]  And the model of businessmen and women with can-do know-how using the money for Americana
[02:05:43.390 --> 02:05:45.390]  freedom to fight the globalists is what they fear.
[02:05:45.390 --> 02:05:46.390]  That's what the debanking is about.
[02:05:46.390 --> 02:05:48.390]  That's what the financial attacks are about.
[02:05:48.390 --> 02:05:53.390]  That's why we've got to rush to support MyPillow.com and InfoWars.com, plus their great products
[02:05:53.390 --> 02:05:56.390]  at both places, because we are the tip of the spear.
[02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:14.390]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com front line report.
[02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:16.390]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:24.390]  We interrupt this broadcast with a special report from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[02:06:25.390 --> 02:06:35.390]  Attempts have been made to neutralize the InfoWarrior known as Alex Jones.
[02:06:35.390 --> 02:06:44.390]  Countless attacks have been witnessed and reported in an effort to bring him down.
[02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:49.390]  Alex Jones has been sighted on the battlefield fighting against the forces of evil.
[02:06:49.390 --> 02:06:52.390]  We're not going to go down and just shut our mouths and just put up with this.
[02:06:52.390 --> 02:06:56.390]  We know where the bodies are buried, folks, and one way or another, we're going to stay on here.
[02:06:59.390 --> 02:07:04.390]  We're receiving reports that Alex Jones has broken through the front lines and is now
[02:07:04.390 --> 02:07:06.390]  heading toward the broadcast studio.
[02:07:06.390 --> 02:07:09.390]  All efforts to silence him have failed.
[02:07:09.390 --> 02:07:15.390]  Find the InfoWars transmission at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:07:15.390 --> 02:07:19.390]  If you're receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:07:20.390 --> 02:07:21.390]  What's going on, everybody?
[02:07:21.390 --> 02:07:22.390]  It is Wednesday morning.
[02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:28.390]  I'm here in Austin, Texas at the 1886 Cafe about to smash a breakfast.
[02:07:28.390 --> 02:07:34.390]  I just finished at the gym, and I guess you could say the tour to change the world kicked
[02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:38.390]  off the moment I crossed into the U.S. and I made it.
[02:07:38.390 --> 02:07:42.390]  That was probably the hardest obstacle for the tour, but I'm going to say it's officially
[02:07:42.390 --> 02:07:44.390]  kicking off today.
[02:07:45.390 --> 02:07:52.390]  I'm going to InfoWars studio in person, the first time I've ever done a live in-person
[02:07:52.390 --> 02:07:55.390]  show anywhere outside of Canada.
[02:07:55.390 --> 02:07:59.390]  I'm pretty excited for it, and here's the best part.
[02:07:59.390 --> 02:08:04.390]  The first hour is going to be Alex and I, and then they have just asked if I will take
[02:08:04.390 --> 02:08:12.390]  over Alex's desk and host the show on InfoWars today, the second hour that I'm going to be
[02:08:12.390 --> 02:08:15.390]  on, and what a way to start the tour.
[02:08:15.390 --> 02:08:19.390]  I'm going to be on InfoWars, hosting InfoWars.
[02:08:19.390 --> 02:08:22.390]  This weekend, I'm at the American Liberty Awards.
[02:08:22.390 --> 02:08:29.390]  Then I'm going to be driving through from Texas to Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, en route
[02:08:29.390 --> 02:08:33.390]  to Miami, have a meet and greet in Miami on the 15th.
[02:08:34.390 --> 02:08:41.390]  We have Vero Beach on the 17th with Mr. Stu Peters in the studio, and a meet and greet
[02:08:41.390 --> 02:08:42.390]  on the 17th.
[02:08:42.390 --> 02:08:46.390]  Then we're driving back towards Texas.
[02:08:46.390 --> 02:08:50.390]  We're looking to stop in Dallas and hopefully meet up with Mr. David Harris Jr.
[02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:53.390]  That has not yet been confirmed, but we're working on it.
[02:08:53.390 --> 02:08:58.390]  From there, I'm going to be in New Mexico with my man, King Bao.
[02:08:58.390 --> 02:09:04.390]  We're going to talk about his new child grooming thing with Jimmy Kimmel, who did not respond,
[02:09:04.390 --> 02:09:05.390]  of course.
[02:09:05.390 --> 02:09:06.390]  What's he going to say?
[02:09:06.390 --> 02:09:11.390]  From there, we're going up to Colorado, and we're going to be with wonderful people at
[02:09:11.390 --> 02:09:13.390]  Conservative Daily.
[02:09:13.390 --> 02:09:15.390]  That's just in the next couple weeks.
[02:09:15.390 --> 02:09:17.390]  We've got more stuff coming up after that.
[02:09:17.390 --> 02:09:22.390]  If you guys want to contact me, if you want to see me when I'm driving through your state,
[02:09:22.390 --> 02:09:24.390]  anything, you know how to reach me.
[02:09:24.390 --> 02:09:28.390]  416-400-9994.
[02:09:28.390 --> 02:09:29.390]  Get at me.
[02:09:29.390 --> 02:09:32.390]  I'm going to be busy as hell, but I'm going to make it happen.
[02:09:32.390 --> 02:09:33.390]  I love you guys.
[02:09:33.390 --> 02:09:35.390]  Can't wait for today.
[02:09:35.390 --> 02:09:44.390]  Info Wars, American Liberty Awards, Stu Peters, hopefully David Harris Jr., King Bao, Conservative
[02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:46.390]  Daily, and much more to come.
[02:09:46.390 --> 02:09:47.390]  Contact me.
[02:09:47.390 --> 02:09:50.390]  416-400-9994.
[02:09:50.390 --> 02:09:51.390]  God bless you guys.
[02:09:51.390 --> 02:09:52.390]  Love you.
[02:09:55.390 --> 02:09:56.390]  All right.
[02:09:56.390 --> 02:09:58.390]  I've known Chris Sky for over three years.
[02:09:58.390 --> 02:10:03.390]  He's the number one Canadian activist against Trudeau, who is a dictator.
[02:10:03.390 --> 02:10:04.390]  We'll explain how that really works.
[02:10:04.390 --> 02:10:07.390]  He's supposedly elected, but he only got 30% of the vote.
[02:10:07.390 --> 02:10:10.390]  And the total tyranny of the WEF is taking place there.
[02:10:10.390 --> 02:10:14.390]  We've also got the latest pedophile news from the UN, where they openly have put out an
[02:10:14.390 --> 02:10:20.389]  official document calling for sex with children as young as five, as long as they want it.
[02:10:20.389 --> 02:10:22.389]  Oh, your child wants their penis cut off.
[02:10:22.389 --> 02:10:24.389]  Oh, your child wants to have sex with a pedophile.
[02:10:24.389 --> 02:10:26.389]  This is incredible information.
[02:10:26.389 --> 02:10:28.389]  I have the document right here.
[02:10:28.389 --> 02:10:31.389]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is all coming up.
[02:10:31.389 --> 02:10:34.389]  Also, Google has committed a crime against humanity.
[02:10:34.389 --> 02:10:39.389]  They weren't just invested in the EcoHealth Alliance Wuhan lab, but they were helping
[02:10:39.389 --> 02:10:41.389]  suppress what really happened with it.
[02:10:41.389 --> 02:10:43.389]  We're going to hit some incredible breaking information.
[02:10:43.389 --> 02:10:45.389]  But I want to play a clip.
[02:10:45.389 --> 02:10:48.389]  I saw the one they put on screen was his later prediction.
[02:10:49.389 --> 02:10:53.389]  There's the famous one with him just straight on six months before they kept the lockdowns
[02:10:53.389 --> 02:10:56.389]  going when they were saying, oh, just 15 days to flatten the curve.
[02:10:56.389 --> 02:10:59.389]  He laid it out perfectly what their plan was.
[02:10:59.389 --> 02:11:01.389]  But here's one of his predictions.
[02:11:06.389 --> 02:11:07.389]  Hey, man, did you want to do an interview?
[02:11:07.389 --> 02:11:09.389]  Sure. What's up?
[02:11:09.389 --> 02:11:11.389]  So we saw you speaking earlier.
[02:11:11.389 --> 02:11:14.389]  What's the main message you're trying to get across today?
[02:11:14.389 --> 02:11:17.389]  The response to COVID is a lot worse than COVID.
[02:11:17.389 --> 02:11:19.389]  And COVID isn't about a virus.
[02:11:19.389 --> 02:11:24.389]  It's about increasing government control over our lives by using fear tactics to make people
[02:11:24.389 --> 02:11:29.389]  comply with giving up the rights and freedoms that millions of people fought and died for.
[02:11:30.389 --> 02:11:33.389]  And what do you say to the people that we spoke to some of the people across the street?
[02:11:33.389 --> 02:11:38.389]  They're saying you guys are all stupid, that a lot of them say mandatory mask outside is
[02:11:38.389 --> 02:11:39.389]  what they want.
[02:11:39.389 --> 02:11:42.389]  How do you respond to people who are against what you're standing for here today?
[02:11:42.389 --> 02:11:45.389]  Well, the fact of the matter is I just came from Netherlands.
[02:11:45.389 --> 02:11:46.389]  The Dutch are not stupid people.
[02:11:46.389 --> 02:11:47.389]  They're smart.
[02:11:47.389 --> 02:11:48.389]  They're independent.
[02:11:48.389 --> 02:11:49.389]  And they have balls.
[02:11:49.389 --> 02:11:50.389]  So guess what?
[02:11:50.389 --> 02:11:51.389]  They have no masks.
[02:11:51.389 --> 02:11:53.389]  They have 17 million people.
[02:11:53.389 --> 02:11:58.389]  If you go to a train station, maybe one out of 20 people is scared enough to wear a mask.
[02:11:58.389 --> 02:12:00.389]  Their bars are open.
[02:12:00.389 --> 02:12:01.389]  The girls are still working.
[02:12:01.389 --> 02:12:03.389]  You can go smoke a joint in their coffee shops.
[02:12:03.389 --> 02:12:05.389]  You can eat in their restaurant.
[02:12:05.389 --> 02:12:07.389]  They're open till two o'clock in the morning.
[02:12:07.389 --> 02:12:10.389]  And they've had less than 200 people up to age 60 die.
[02:12:11.389 --> 02:12:15.389]  And also Amsterdam is one of the top three cities in all of Europe for international travel.
[02:12:15.389 --> 02:12:18.389]  50 million visitors a year from all over the world.
[02:12:18.389 --> 02:12:21.389]  So I met people from all different countries when I was there.
[02:12:21.389 --> 02:12:22.389]  Guess what?
[02:12:22.389 --> 02:12:26.389]  The only other country that's stupid like Canada and wearing masks on their school children
[02:12:26.389 --> 02:12:28.389]  was Germany and Belgium.
[02:12:28.389 --> 02:12:31.389]  Belgium's EU and UN headquarters.
[02:12:31.389 --> 02:12:35.389]  And Germany's had millions of people protesting in the streets over it.
[02:12:35.389 --> 02:12:37.389]  Italy, no masks on the kids.
[02:12:37.389 --> 02:12:39.389]  France, only masks for 12 and older.
[02:12:39.389 --> 02:12:41.389]  Egypt, no mask on the kids.
[02:12:41.389 --> 02:12:43.389]  Iran, no mask on the kids.
[02:12:43.389 --> 02:12:45.389]  Sweden, no mask on the kids.
[02:12:45.389 --> 02:12:46.389]  Finland, no mask.
[02:12:46.389 --> 02:12:47.389]  Denmark, no mask.
[02:12:47.389 --> 02:12:53.389]  So why do we need them here where all these other countries are just fine without them?
[02:12:53.389 --> 02:12:54.389]  Answer?
[02:12:54.389 --> 02:12:55.389]  You don't.
[02:12:55.389 --> 02:12:58.389]  And when you have real world examples, that's the proof.
[02:12:58.389 --> 02:12:59.389]  It's that simple.
[02:12:59.389 --> 02:13:00.389]  You don't need a mask.
[02:13:00.389 --> 02:13:02.389]  The mask is about compliance.
[02:13:02.389 --> 02:13:04.389]  Because they know Canadians like to do what they're told.
[02:13:04.389 --> 02:13:08.389]  So if they tell you you have to wear a mask, next they're going to tell you you have to contact trace.
[02:13:08.389 --> 02:13:10.389]  And then they're going to tell you you have to take the vaccine.
[02:13:10.389 --> 02:13:14.389]  And because Canadians like to do what they're told, they're hoping that everyone just complies.
[02:13:14.389 --> 02:13:15.389]  And then guess what, kids?
[02:13:15.389 --> 02:13:19.389]  Once you take your vaccine, like a dumb person that doesn't know any better,
[02:13:19.389 --> 02:13:24.389]  they're going to tell you, sorry, the vaccine isn't as effective as it used to be.
[02:13:24.389 --> 02:13:27.389]  So now you've still got to wear your mask, still got to get contact trace,
[02:13:27.389 --> 02:13:31.389]  still have all the restrictions and social distancing, and still take your vaccine.
[02:13:31.389 --> 02:13:33.389]  And then what did you get out of all of this?
[02:13:33.389 --> 02:13:37.389]  You got a whole year where you weren't allowed to travel, your business was closed,
[02:13:37.389 --> 02:13:42.389]  they took your rights and freedoms, they forced a vaccine on you, and what happened?
[02:13:42.389 --> 02:13:44.389]  The same amount of people died.
[02:13:44.389 --> 02:13:45.389]  Everything is the exact same.
[02:13:45.389 --> 02:13:50.389]  And now they're going to put you back on lockdown and bring it all the way until July of next year
[02:13:50.389 --> 02:13:52.389]  so they can do the same thing again.
[02:13:52.389 --> 02:13:56.389]  Bring you from July, August, and September, getting you off lockdown,
[02:13:56.389 --> 02:13:58.389]  but just to bring you back on lockdown again.
[02:13:58.389 --> 02:14:03.389]  If you idiots haven't figured it out yet, it's a perpetual cycle that you never get out of.
[02:14:03.389 --> 02:14:08.389]  And it's a way to take your rights, your freedoms, close your business, take your wealth.
[02:14:08.389 --> 02:14:10.389]  Why? So you become dependent on government.
[02:14:10.389 --> 02:14:14.389]  Why? If you're independent, the government works for you like it's supposed to.
[02:14:14.389 --> 02:14:18.389]  If you depend on the government to give you a paycheck to feed your family every month
[02:14:18.389 --> 02:14:22.389]  because they closed your business on you, now the government doesn't work for you,
[02:14:22.389 --> 02:14:24.389]  the government rules you.
[02:14:24.389 --> 02:14:28.389]  So instead of a middle class, we have the government, upper class,
[02:14:28.389 --> 02:14:32.389]  and the lower class dependents that rely on the government to survive.
[02:14:32.389 --> 02:14:35.389]  In other words, we have a slave class, and that's what they're trying to do.
[02:14:35.389 --> 02:14:36.389]  It's that simple.
[02:14:36.389 --> 02:14:37.389]  All right. Thanks a lot, Chris.
[02:14:37.389 --> 02:14:39.389]  Why didn't the cops shut it down today?
[02:14:39.389 --> 02:14:42.389]  Cops didn't shut it down because they don't have the power to shut it down.
[02:14:42.389 --> 02:14:46.389]  I'm on quarantine. I was just in Ireland speaking to 15,000 people.
[02:14:46.389 --> 02:14:49.389]  They grabbed me before I could even get out of the car and said,
[02:14:49.389 --> 02:14:51.389]  you're not allowed to be here. Get out of here.
[02:14:51.389 --> 02:14:54.389]  I said, what are you going to do? Find me? Arrest me? Go for it.
[02:14:54.389 --> 02:14:58.389]  Do it right in front of everybody so I can challenge it, make it public,
[02:14:58.389 --> 02:15:01.389]  challenge it with all the different Charter of Rights and Freedoms that you're breaking
[02:15:01.389 --> 02:15:06.389]  under these emergency laws that you do not have demonstratable justification to uphold,
[02:15:06.389 --> 02:15:09.389]  and then I will win, everybody will know your laws are bullshit,
[02:15:09.389 --> 02:15:11.389]  and this whole charade collapses.
[02:15:11.389 --> 02:15:14.389]  Newsflash. They found over 600 people breaking quarantine.
[02:15:14.389 --> 02:15:17.389]  You know how many got fines? Zero.
[02:15:17.389 --> 02:15:19.389]  It's not because they're cutting them a break.
[02:15:19.389 --> 02:15:21.389]  It's because they don't have the power to do it.
[02:15:21.389 --> 02:15:23.389]  Just like they don't have the power to shut down your business
[02:15:23.389 --> 02:15:26.389]  or give you a $100,000 fine if you stay open.
[02:15:26.389 --> 02:15:30.389]  It's all lies. It's all smoke and mirrors, and none of it will hold up in court, and I'm proof.
[02:15:30.389 --> 02:15:32.389]  They grabbed me. I'm here. I'm speaking to you.
[02:15:32.389 --> 02:15:35.389]  I'm speaking on the van. I'm not hiding from anyone.
[02:15:35.389 --> 02:15:38.389]  You want me to take you and go talk to the police right now? I will.
[02:15:39.389 --> 02:15:43.389]  That's September of 2020, almost three years ago.
[02:15:43.389 --> 02:15:46.389]  It's easy to share that now and go, oh, that guy's just talking about what happened.
[02:15:46.389 --> 02:15:49.389]  No, he was talking about what was about to happen.
[02:15:49.389 --> 02:15:51.389]  He'll tell us what he believes is coming next,
[02:15:51.389 --> 02:15:53.389]  and I'm honored to have a hand in this guy's great development.
[02:15:53.389 --> 02:15:55.389]  Been listening to me since he was 14 years old.
[02:15:55.389 --> 02:15:57.389]  That's decades ago.
[02:15:57.389 --> 02:16:00.389]  Chris Sky is here at Chris.
[02:16:00.389 --> 02:16:02.389]  What's the best place for people to visit you?
[02:16:02.389 --> 02:16:03.389]  Arealchrissky.com?
[02:16:03.389 --> 02:16:05.389]  That's right.
[02:16:05.389 --> 02:16:09.389]  And you give out your personal number, 416-400-9994.
[02:16:09.389 --> 02:16:13.389]  You're here for the Liberty Awards coming up at the Vulcan Gas Company.
[02:16:13.389 --> 02:16:16.389]  One of Joe Rogan's haunts this weekend, this Saturday.
[02:16:16.389 --> 02:16:19.389]  Yeah, apparently I was nominated for Best Public Servant.
[02:16:19.389 --> 02:16:21.389]  I'm the only non-American nominated,
[02:16:21.389 --> 02:16:24.389]  and I believe that's the only reason I actually got across the border.
[02:16:24.389 --> 02:16:26.389]  I haven't been in the U.S. for about 10 years.
[02:16:26.389 --> 02:16:28.389]  Yeah, let's talk about that. That's a whole other area.
[02:16:28.389 --> 02:16:31.389]  I get detained when I go to Canada, too, for six hours.
[02:16:31.389 --> 02:16:33.390]  You got detained for six hours.
[02:16:33.390 --> 02:16:35.390]  Tell us what happened to you.
[02:16:35.390 --> 02:16:38.390]  So I wanted to come for the awards.
[02:16:38.390 --> 02:16:40.390]  I was in Mexico basically on a vacation,
[02:16:40.390 --> 02:16:45.390]  and I figured it'd probably be easier for me to cross from Mexico into the States than anywhere else.
[02:16:45.390 --> 02:16:48.390]  So I jumped on a bus, and I tried to make it across.
[02:16:49.390 --> 02:16:52.390]  And when I got to the border and they scanned my passport,
[02:16:52.390 --> 02:16:56.390]  it set off a literal alarm in the station,
[02:16:56.390 --> 02:16:58.390]  and they all just stopped what they were doing.
[02:16:58.390 --> 02:16:59.390]  The phone rang.
[02:16:59.390 --> 02:17:00.390]  They got a call.
[02:17:00.390 --> 02:17:02.390]  They separated me from everyone in my luggage.
[02:17:02.390 --> 02:17:04.390]  I got detained just like you did.
[02:17:04.390 --> 02:17:05.390]  I got questioned.
[02:17:05.390 --> 02:17:06.390]  I was detained for so long.
[02:17:06.390 --> 02:17:08.390]  Shift change happened.
[02:17:08.390 --> 02:17:09.390]  Then they didn't know what to do with me,
[02:17:09.390 --> 02:17:13.390]  because they said they needed to wait for more information from different departments.
[02:17:13.390 --> 02:17:15.390]  So they just threw me in a cell.
[02:17:15.390 --> 02:17:16.390]  By that point, I was so tired,
[02:17:16.390 --> 02:17:18.390]  I had used it like a hotel room and went to bed.
[02:17:18.390 --> 02:17:20.390]  It was actually way more comfortable in the cells in Canada.
[02:17:20.390 --> 02:17:22.390]  And after like six, seven hours,
[02:17:22.390 --> 02:17:25.390]  they interviewed me one last time,
[02:17:25.390 --> 02:17:27.390]  saw that I was there for the awards,
[02:17:27.390 --> 02:17:29.390]  saw I'm up against people like Donald Trump,
[02:17:29.390 --> 02:17:30.390]  and they said,
[02:17:30.390 --> 02:17:31.390]  Welcome to the United States.
[02:17:31.390 --> 02:17:34.390]  So I'm actually in a really, really good mood,
[02:17:34.390 --> 02:17:37.390]  because they had the sole ability to deny me,
[02:17:37.390 --> 02:17:42.390]  and it showed that they truly still believe in freedom here in the United States.
[02:17:42.390 --> 02:17:47.390]  Oh, when I came back from Cancun about six, eight months ago,
[02:17:47.390 --> 02:17:48.390]  they go,
[02:17:48.390 --> 02:17:49.390]  Hey, Alex.
[02:17:49.390 --> 02:17:50.390]  He goes,
[02:17:50.390 --> 02:17:51.390]  Whoa.
[02:17:51.390 --> 02:17:52.390]  He goes,
[02:17:52.390 --> 02:17:53.390]  We got to pull you aside.
[02:17:53.390 --> 02:17:54.390]  And by the time they were done,
[02:17:54.390 --> 02:17:55.390]  they apologized.
[02:17:55.390 --> 02:17:56.390]  They said,
[02:17:56.390 --> 02:17:57.390]  Yeah,
[02:17:57.390 --> 02:17:58.390]  you need to do a FOIA request.
[02:17:58.390 --> 02:17:59.390]  This is BS,
[02:17:59.390 --> 02:18:00.390]  man.
[02:18:00.390 --> 02:18:01.390]  They put some really bad stuff on your record.
[02:18:01.390 --> 02:18:02.390]  We know you're a good guy.
[02:18:02.390 --> 02:18:03.390]  No criminal record.
[02:18:03.390 --> 02:18:04.390]  They had me basically singled out as a terrorist.
[02:18:04.390 --> 02:18:05.390]  And that's just the bureaucrats up there can do that,
[02:18:05.390 --> 02:18:06.390]  but there's still the discretionary power of federal and state law enforcement.
[02:18:06.390 --> 02:18:07.390]  They can just say,
[02:18:07.390 --> 02:18:08.390]  This is BS.
[02:18:08.390 --> 02:18:09.390]  Yeah.
[02:18:09.390 --> 02:18:10.390]  And that's why I got to big them up,
[02:18:10.390 --> 02:18:14.390]  because I've dealt with a law enforcement all over Canada,
[02:18:14.390 --> 02:18:15.390]  every province,
[02:18:15.390 --> 02:18:16.390]  border services,
[02:18:16.390 --> 02:18:17.390]  et cetera.
[02:18:17.390 --> 02:18:18.390]  And over there,
[02:18:18.390 --> 02:18:21.390]  you could tell these men and women were dedicated to their job,
[02:18:21.390 --> 02:18:24.390]  but they were also dedicated to your constitution.
[02:18:24.390 --> 02:18:27.390]  And it was a really good feeling to know that they actually cared and it
[02:18:27.390 --> 02:18:28.390]  actually mattered.
[02:18:28.390 --> 02:18:31.390]  So alarms went off when they scanned your passport.
[02:18:31.390 --> 02:18:32.390]  Seriously,
[02:18:32.390 --> 02:18:33.390]  like a siren.
[02:18:33.390 --> 02:18:34.390]  I don't know.
[02:18:34.390 --> 02:18:35.390]  You want to call an alarm,
[02:18:35.390 --> 02:18:36.390]  a siren,
[02:18:36.390 --> 02:18:37.390]  something went off in the thing.
[02:18:37.390 --> 02:18:38.390]  It was weird.
[02:18:38.390 --> 02:18:39.390]  And then phone rang right away.
[02:18:39.390 --> 02:18:40.390]  And the first thing the guy said is,
[02:18:40.390 --> 02:18:41.390]  really,
[02:18:41.390 --> 02:18:43.390]  you want me to do that right now with him?
[02:18:43.390 --> 02:18:44.390]  Okay.
[02:18:44.390 --> 02:18:45.390]  And they just hung up the phone.
[02:18:45.390 --> 02:18:48.390]  They just brought me to a secondary area by myself and it started,
[02:18:48.390 --> 02:18:49.390]  but they were,
[02:18:49.390 --> 02:18:50.390]  they were nice.
[02:18:50.390 --> 02:18:51.390]  They did the same thing with me.
[02:18:51.390 --> 02:18:52.390]  They go,
[02:18:52.390 --> 02:18:53.390]  they go,
[02:18:53.390 --> 02:18:54.390]  really?
[02:18:54.390 --> 02:18:55.390]  Okay.
[02:18:55.390 --> 02:18:56.390]  All right,
[02:18:56.390 --> 02:18:57.390]  Alex.
[02:18:57.390 --> 02:18:58.390]  Okay.
[02:18:58.390 --> 02:18:59.390]  This is like,
[02:18:59.390 --> 02:19:00.390]  all right.
[02:19:00.390 --> 02:19:01.390]  And they come out and go,
[02:19:01.390 --> 02:19:02.390]  this is BS.
[02:19:02.390 --> 02:19:03.390]  You need to,
[02:19:03.390 --> 02:19:04.390]  you need to do a four year.
[02:19:04.390 --> 02:19:05.390]  This is not right.
[02:19:05.390 --> 02:19:06.390]  We're letting you go.
[02:19:06.390 --> 02:19:07.390]  And the next time I came back in,
[02:19:07.390 --> 02:19:08.390]  this was about a year ago.
[02:19:08.390 --> 02:19:09.390]  Today,
[02:19:09.390 --> 02:19:10.390]  we're not even just go on through.
[02:19:10.390 --> 02:19:11.390]  I mean,
[02:19:11.390 --> 02:19:12.390]  it's because they're,
[02:19:12.390 --> 02:19:13.390]  they're sick of it.
[02:19:13.390 --> 02:19:14.390]  They know it's BS.
[02:19:14.390 --> 02:19:15.390]  They know,
[02:19:15.390 --> 02:19:16.390]  especially COVID was the pinnacle of the BS.
[02:19:16.390 --> 02:19:17.390]  They made all these law enforcement,
[02:19:17.390 --> 02:19:18.390]  go against their oath,
[02:19:18.390 --> 02:19:19.390]  go against their own conscience,
[02:19:19.390 --> 02:19:20.390]  go against morality,
[02:19:20.390 --> 02:19:21.390]  go against their own people and families.
[02:19:21.390 --> 02:19:22.390]  And that wage is a toll and they've had enough of it.
[02:19:22.390 --> 02:19:23.390]  And I noticed it in Canada.
[02:19:23.390 --> 02:19:24.390]  Yeah.
[02:19:24.390 --> 02:19:25.390]  We're trying to make the police.
[02:19:25.390 --> 02:19:26.390]  Everybody take the deadly shots.
[02:19:26.390 --> 02:19:27.390]  Exactly.
[02:19:27.390 --> 02:19:28.390]  And they're still trying.
[02:19:28.390 --> 02:19:29.390]  In fact,
[02:19:29.390 --> 02:19:30.390]  uh,
[02:19:30.390 --> 02:19:31.390]  they already announced that in British Columbia on the West coast of Canada,
[02:19:31.390 --> 02:19:32.390]  they're trying to reinstitute mask mandates.
[02:19:32.390 --> 02:19:33.390]  For the coming school year.
[02:19:33.390 --> 02:19:34.390]  It's ridiculous.
[02:19:34.390 --> 02:19:35.390]  And I think,
[02:19:35.390 --> 02:19:36.390]  and if they,
[02:19:36.390 --> 02:19:37.390]  and if they,
[02:19:37.390 --> 02:19:38.390]  they started talking about heiress,
[02:19:38.390 --> 02:19:39.390]  the new variant,
[02:19:39.390 --> 02:19:40.390]  they started talking about upticks in cases.
[02:19:40.390 --> 02:19:41.390]  They're doing the exact same predictive program that they did at the beginning of the pandemic,
[02:19:41.390 --> 02:19:42.390]  because all of their agendas stalled COVID was working very well for them.
[02:19:42.390 --> 02:19:43.390]  We kind of stopped it in Canada with the trucker convoy.
[02:19:43.390 --> 02:19:44.390]  That's what stopped our mandates.
[02:19:44.390 --> 02:19:45.390]  That's what got our travel ban.
[02:19:45.390 --> 02:19:46.390]  That's what got our travel ban.
[02:19:46.390 --> 02:19:47.390]  And it's,
[02:19:47.390 --> 02:19:48.390]  it's,
[02:19:48.390 --> 02:19:49.390]  it's,
[02:19:49.390 --> 02:19:50.390]  it's,
[02:19:50.390 --> 02:19:51.390]  it's,
[02:19:51.390 --> 02:19:52.390]  it's,
[02:19:52.390 --> 02:19:53.390]  it's,
[02:19:53.390 --> 02:19:54.390]  it's,
[02:19:54.390 --> 02:19:55.390]  it's,

[02:32:36.390 --> 02:32:37.390]  it's,
[02:32:37.390 --> 02:32:38.390]  it's,
[02:32:38.390 --> 02:32:39.390]  it's,

[02:33:11.390 --> 02:33:12.390]  it's,
[02:33:12.390 --> 02:33:13.390]  it's,

[02:33:14.390 --> 02:33:15.390]  it's,
[02:33:15.390 --> 02:33:16.390]  it's,
[02:33:16.390 --> 02:33:17.390]  it's,
[02:33:17.390 --> 02:33:18.390]  it's,

[02:33:20.390 --> 02:33:21.390]  it's,
[02:33:21.390 --> 02:33:22.390]  it's,
[02:33:22.390 --> 02:33:23.390]  it's,
[02:33:23.390 --> 02:33:24.390]  it's,
[02:33:24.390 --> 02:33:25.390]  it's,
[02:33:25.390 --> 02:33:26.390]  it's,
[02:33:26.390 --> 02:33:27.390]  it's,
[02:33:27.390 --> 02:33:28.390]  it's,
[02:33:28.390 --> 02:33:29.390]  it's,
[02:33:29.390 --> 02:33:30.390]  it's,
[02:33:30.390 --> 02:33:31.390]  it's,
[02:33:31.390 --> 02:33:32.390]  it's,
[02:33:32.390 --> 02:33:33.390]  it's,
[02:33:06.630 --> 02:33:33.630]  From the frontlines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:34.630 --> 02:33:41.630]  Well, you had a real fighter in studio with us.
[02:33:41.630 --> 02:33:43.630]  Your phone calls are coming up.
[02:33:43.630 --> 02:33:48.630]  Chris Sky, get back into big picture and what the enemy's going to try next,
[02:33:48.630 --> 02:33:50.630]  because you're really good at analyzing that.
[02:33:50.630 --> 02:33:52.630]  It's a smart cookie, but before you do that,
[02:33:52.630 --> 02:33:55.630]  how would you describe the awakening that is happening right now?
[02:33:55.630 --> 02:33:56.630]  I think it's exponential.
[02:33:56.630 --> 02:33:58.630]  I think the globalists have bit off more than they can chew.
[02:33:58.630 --> 02:33:59.630]  Oh, totally.
[02:33:59.630 --> 02:34:04.630]  They showed their hand, they woke everybody up,
[02:34:04.630 --> 02:34:09.630]  and we can use simple math to prove that when they try the next pandemic,
[02:34:09.630 --> 02:34:11.630]  it's simply not going to work.
[02:34:11.630 --> 02:34:13.630]  They're not going to be able to institute the mandates like they did before.
[02:34:13.630 --> 02:34:15.630]  And how can I be so sure of that?
[02:34:15.630 --> 02:34:16.630]  How can I prove that?
[02:34:16.630 --> 02:34:18.630]  Well, in the U.S. alone, they already admit that, what,
[02:34:18.630 --> 02:34:22.630]  30% of the people didn't take the first or second or third or fourth jabs.
[02:34:22.630 --> 02:34:23.630]  They didn't take any.
[02:34:23.630 --> 02:34:24.630]  Correct?
[02:34:24.630 --> 02:34:25.630]  Yes.
[02:34:25.630 --> 02:34:26.630]  Okay.
[02:34:26.630 --> 02:34:30.630]  Most people out of the 70%, whether they took two jabs or seven jabs,
[02:34:30.630 --> 02:34:33.630]  have said that they're never going to take another jab.
[02:34:33.630 --> 02:34:34.630]  The majority.
[02:34:34.630 --> 02:34:35.630]  A lot of them.
[02:34:35.630 --> 02:34:39.630]  So if they can't get that 70% again, they can't mandate.
[02:34:39.630 --> 02:34:40.630]  60% is not enough.
[02:34:40.630 --> 02:34:41.630]  50% is not enough.
[02:34:41.630 --> 02:34:45.630]  So unless they can get the exact same level of compliance that they got the
[02:34:45.630 --> 02:34:48.630]  first time, they're not going to be able to mandate it.
[02:34:48.630 --> 02:34:51.630]  If we've done our job and people like us have done our job,
[02:34:51.630 --> 02:34:54.630]  that means we're going to get at least 10, 20,
[02:34:54.630 --> 02:34:57.630]  maybe even 30% of the population now more on our side.
[02:34:57.630 --> 02:34:58.630]  And let me interrupt to back you up.
[02:34:58.630 --> 02:35:01.630]  I meant to play at them two months ago, but she's so disgusting.
[02:35:01.630 --> 02:35:02.630]  I just couldn't do it.
[02:35:02.630 --> 02:35:05.630]  Chelsea Clinton was hosting the Clinton Foundation event.
[02:35:05.630 --> 02:35:07.630]  And I sent the clip of the crew.
[02:35:07.630 --> 02:35:08.630]  We never did it.
[02:35:08.630 --> 02:35:10.630]  We had an article on Infowars about it.
[02:35:10.630 --> 02:35:14.630]  But she said, after COVID, even less people trust the shots.
[02:35:14.630 --> 02:35:17.630]  So we've got to even do a better job to make them take it working with
[02:35:17.630 --> 02:35:19.630]  industries and government.
[02:35:19.630 --> 02:35:21.630]  She's right there saying we're kicking their ass.
[02:35:21.630 --> 02:35:22.630]  It's true.
[02:35:22.630 --> 02:35:23.630]  And we are.
[02:35:23.630 --> 02:35:26.630]  They had to throw away millions and millions of dollars' worth of shots.
[02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:30.630]  They're running a massive propaganda campaign right now in Canada to try
[02:35:30.630 --> 02:35:34.630]  to get people to take it as an annual shot like just another flu vaccine.
[02:35:34.630 --> 02:35:36.630]  A tornado destroyed millions of them a few weeks ago?
[02:35:36.630 --> 02:35:39.630]  Yeah, I'm sure that was just a wonderful act of God.
[02:35:39.630 --> 02:35:41.630]  And this is the kind of stuff that's happening all over the world.
[02:35:41.630 --> 02:35:45.630]  Moderna's stock is down like 50%, and they're begging for more government money.
[02:35:45.630 --> 02:35:49.630]  Isn't it funny how all these stocks got pumped up with government-funded
[02:35:49.630 --> 02:35:51.630]  tax dollars, and now that they're in the toilet,
[02:35:51.630 --> 02:35:53.630]  they want more government-funded money?
[02:35:53.630 --> 02:35:55.630]  This is how big pharma works.
[02:35:55.630 --> 02:35:57.630]  And that's why they're doing this whole agenda.
[02:35:57.630 --> 02:35:59.630]  We've got to talk about the agenda they're doing against the kids,
[02:35:59.630 --> 02:36:02.630]  because it's part of the big pharma industry too.
[02:36:02.630 --> 02:36:04.630]  Because they can't fool the adults, so they're going to target the children,
[02:36:04.630 --> 02:36:08.630]  like all drug dealers and pedophiles and scumbags do.
[02:36:08.630 --> 02:36:09.630]  Well, yeah.
[02:36:09.630 --> 02:36:11.630]  The children's mind is the most malleable thing on the planet.
[02:36:11.630 --> 02:36:14.630]  So you can teach a child just like they're doing.
[02:36:14.630 --> 02:36:16.630]  You can teach a child that there's really 75 genders.
[02:36:16.630 --> 02:36:18.630]  You can teach a child that they can choose their pronoun.
[02:36:18.630 --> 02:36:20.630]  You can tell a child the Easter Bunny's real.
[02:36:20.630 --> 02:36:21.630]  Yeah.
[02:36:21.630 --> 02:36:23.630]  You can even tell a child, hey, you want to be the Easter Bunny?
[02:36:23.630 --> 02:36:24.630]  You can be.
[02:36:24.630 --> 02:36:26.630]  And they do things like that in the schools today.
[02:36:26.630 --> 02:36:29.630]  And if you try to go against it, they pretend that there's something wrong
[02:36:29.630 --> 02:36:30.630]  with you.
[02:36:30.630 --> 02:36:31.630]  They tell you you need to be open-minded.
[02:36:31.630 --> 02:36:36.630]  And it got to the point now that Pride used to be a parade in Canada.
[02:36:36.630 --> 02:36:39.630]  Then Pride turned into a month in Canada.
[02:36:39.630 --> 02:36:46.630]  Now Pride in Canada on the Government Wednesday is officially an entire season.
[02:36:46.630 --> 02:36:48.630]  Do you think that helps our tourism?
[02:36:48.630 --> 02:36:50.630]  Do you think people want to come from all over the world to summer,
[02:36:50.630 --> 02:36:52.630]  the only warm time in Canada?
[02:36:52.630 --> 02:36:54.630]  Where a bunch of people push their sexual preference on you.
[02:36:54.630 --> 02:36:55.630]  It's weird.
[02:36:55.630 --> 02:36:56.630]  Not even push their sexual preference on you.
[02:36:56.630 --> 02:36:57.630]  It's worse now.
[02:36:57.630 --> 02:37:00.630]  They've actually made it in law that it is legal.
[02:37:00.630 --> 02:37:04.630]  And we have police officers on video saying these words,
[02:37:04.630 --> 02:37:11.630]  that it is legal for a man to walk around completely nude with his genitals
[02:37:11.630 --> 02:37:17.630]  completely exposed unless it is, and I quote, I'm quoting a police officer now,
[02:37:17.630 --> 02:37:23.630]  unless the person's penis is fully erect and they are currently masturbating.
[02:37:23.630 --> 02:37:26.630]  So if they have a half-erect penis and they're getting...
[02:37:26.630 --> 02:37:27.630]  That's right.
[02:37:27.630 --> 02:37:29.630]  The sergeant said on tape, no, if it's a gay pride,
[02:37:29.630 --> 02:37:31.630]  they can do anything including naked in front of children.
[02:37:31.630 --> 02:37:32.630]  Yeah.
[02:37:32.630 --> 02:37:34.630]  And we're supposed to be okay with that.
[02:37:34.630 --> 02:37:37.630]  If we're not okay with that, it means we're not open-minded.
[02:37:37.630 --> 02:37:42.630]  In Toronto, I exposed how they use taxpayer dollars to hire,
[02:37:42.630 --> 02:37:45.630]  and this was endorsed by the Deputy Mayor of Toronto, Jennifer McAlvey,
[02:37:45.630 --> 02:37:51.630]  and using our dollars to hire what they called an award-winning drag queen
[02:37:51.630 --> 02:37:58.630]  to go to a middle school with children as young as 12 and not just read Drag Queen Story Hour.
[02:37:58.630 --> 02:37:59.630]  No, no.
[02:37:59.630 --> 02:38:06.630]  This was a full-on performance where this man is dressing up in scantily clad female outfits
[02:38:06.630 --> 02:38:12.630]  and then stripping it down to female underwear that is not designed to hold male body parts.
[02:38:12.630 --> 02:38:13.630]  And let's talk about this.
[02:38:13.630 --> 02:38:16.630]  Imagine if your buddy invited you out to a company party at a steakhouse,
[02:38:16.630 --> 02:38:20.630]  and you get there and everybody's wives are dressed in G-strings like hookers,
[02:38:20.630 --> 02:38:21.630]  shaking their ass.
[02:38:21.630 --> 02:38:23.630]  You'd go, this is some kind of weird sex cult.
[02:38:23.630 --> 02:38:25.630]  Amongst adults, this is bizarre.
[02:38:25.630 --> 02:38:28.630]  Or if somebody tried to take a child to a topless bar, they'd be arrested.
[02:38:28.630 --> 02:38:32.630]  But if it's the LGBTPS group, then it's okay.
[02:38:32.630 --> 02:38:34.630]  It's not even okay.
[02:38:34.630 --> 02:38:35.630]  It's celebrated.
[02:38:35.630 --> 02:38:36.630]  It's promoted.
[02:38:36.630 --> 02:38:41.630]  They'll actually take video clips of a mother giving like a dollar bill to an 8-year-old child
[02:38:42.630 --> 02:38:46.630]  to go put in a 45-year-old 220-pound man's G-string.
[02:38:46.630 --> 02:38:50.630]  It is absolutely ludicrous, and it's happening on a daily basis.
[02:38:50.630 --> 02:38:51.630]  We've been exposing it.
[02:38:51.630 --> 02:38:52.630]  So how bad is it going to get?
[02:38:52.630 --> 02:38:54.630]  Because they just get crazier by the minute.
[02:38:54.630 --> 02:38:58.630]  Well, it was getting really bad until they came out with something called SOGI in Canada,
[02:38:58.630 --> 02:39:00.630]  Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity.
[02:39:00.630 --> 02:39:05.630]  And when I was running for mayor of Toronto, I made it one of the forefronts of the discussion.
[02:39:05.630 --> 02:39:09.630]  And now they awaken the monster in Canada.
[02:39:10.630 --> 02:39:12.630]  People are protesting everywhere.
[02:39:12.630 --> 02:39:13.630]  Not just people.
[02:39:13.630 --> 02:39:19.630]  For the first time since I've been around, we have a whole section of Muslims combined
[02:39:19.630 --> 02:39:23.630]  with a whole section of Christians combined with a whole section of atheists.
[02:39:23.630 --> 02:39:24.630]  And they're all together.
[02:39:24.630 --> 02:39:27.630]  And they're all saying the exact same thing.
[02:39:27.630 --> 02:39:29.630]  Leave our kids alone.
[02:39:29.630 --> 02:39:31.630]  They're pulling down pride flags.
[02:39:31.630 --> 02:39:35.630]  They're calling out superintendents that are trying to push this agenda.
[02:39:35.630 --> 02:39:38.630]  And they're finally speaking out against it.
[02:39:38.630 --> 02:39:39.630]  And that ties into Dylan Mulvaney.
[02:39:39.630 --> 02:39:41.630]  Oh my God.
[02:39:41.630 --> 02:39:45.630]  That was the biggest blunder, I believe, in advertising history.
[02:39:45.630 --> 02:39:48.630]  I don't think if there's anything bigger, I don't think we're going to see anything bigger.
[02:39:48.630 --> 02:39:52.630]  And it just goes to the adage, go woke, get broke.
[02:39:52.630 --> 02:39:53.630]  And you should.
[02:39:53.630 --> 02:39:58.630]  How can you take something like beer and then try to promote it with a trans ideology?
[02:39:58.630 --> 02:39:59.630]  It just doesn't work.
[02:39:59.630 --> 02:40:00.630]  I'm sorry.
[02:40:00.630 --> 02:40:04.630]  It may work with autistic five-year-olds, but nobody else.
[02:40:04.630 --> 02:40:06.630]  Well, look what Italy just did.
[02:40:06.630 --> 02:40:14.630]  They banned transgender females, I use that lightly, from performing in beauty pageants.
[02:40:14.630 --> 02:40:16.630]  And they were looked at as bigots around the world.
[02:40:16.630 --> 02:40:19.630]  But I applaud Italians, and I have an Italian background.
[02:40:19.630 --> 02:40:24.630]  And I say they're the first country to actually stand up for women and actually protect women's rights.
[02:40:24.630 --> 02:40:27.630]  And I believe more women around the world should be complaining about that.
[02:40:27.630 --> 02:40:32.630]  It's beautiful how they banned Leah Thomas, I can't even use that name with a straight face,
[02:40:32.630 --> 02:40:35.630]  from competing against other females in the pool.
[02:40:35.630 --> 02:40:40.630]  But we should be having a complete ban on transgenders competing in sports.
[02:40:40.630 --> 02:40:42.630]  It just doesn't make any sense.
[02:40:42.630 --> 02:40:47.630]  And you never see a transgender male wanting to compete against males.
[02:40:47.630 --> 02:40:52.630]  It's always a transgender female, which is a biological male, who wants to compete against females.
[02:40:52.630 --> 02:40:57.630]  So that's just because they want an unfair advantage physically, and that's exactly what we're seeing.
[02:40:57.630 --> 02:41:01.630]  There's not women transgendering and competing against men because they'll get destroyed.
[02:41:01.630 --> 02:41:02.630]  Exactly.
[02:41:03.630 --> 02:41:06.630]  But the system says if we can sell them this, they'll put up with anything.
[02:41:06.630 --> 02:41:08.630]  Yeah, and that's what they're doing.
[02:41:08.630 --> 02:41:09.630]  It's like Orwell said.
[02:41:09.630 --> 02:41:15.630]  He was more worried about leaders being able to change the meaning of words and rewrite history than he was nuclear bombs.
[02:41:15.630 --> 02:41:20.630]  Because if you can create a world where every single thing that people believe is a lie,
[02:41:20.630 --> 02:41:27.630]  now you've manipulated every single choice that person makes, every single hour of the day.
[02:41:27.630 --> 02:41:28.630]  And that's what the government wants.
[02:41:28.630 --> 02:41:29.630]  They want complete control.
[02:41:29.630 --> 02:41:32.630]  Well, if you don't have a language that's based on reality, you can never break out.
[02:41:32.630 --> 02:41:33.630]  100 percent.
[02:41:33.630 --> 02:41:36.630]  You're in a complete prison, whether you know it or not.
[02:41:36.630 --> 02:41:41.630]  You're in a prison of the mind, a prison of the body, and pretty soon you're going to be a prison of a 15-minute city.
[02:41:41.630 --> 02:41:42.630]  Well, I know this.
[02:41:42.630 --> 02:41:45.630]  Five, six years ago, I had to have bodyguards to walk the streets.
[02:41:45.630 --> 02:41:48.630]  Still had mainly people that liked me, but I had a lot of hate.
[02:41:48.630 --> 02:41:51.630]  A year now, I've had one guy come up and get in my face.
[02:41:51.630 --> 02:41:55.630]  And now I sit there in restaurants, mainly people shake my hand, buy me a drink.
[02:41:55.630 --> 02:41:58.630]  And people, you know, a few will sit there and stare at me, but they don't open their mouths now.
[02:41:58.630 --> 02:42:01.630]  Something changed because they know they're chumps.
[02:42:01.630 --> 02:42:02.630]  No, you're right.
[02:42:02.630 --> 02:42:07.630]  I've noticed from 2020 to now, I've noticed a complete 180 in society,
[02:42:07.630 --> 02:42:14.630]  and that's how I know that we've been very effective at going through at least Phase 1 and 2 of united noncompliance.
[02:42:14.630 --> 02:42:16.630]  Phase 1, the global awakening.
[02:42:16.630 --> 02:42:18.630]  Phase 2 would be taking action.
[02:42:18.630 --> 02:42:20.630]  But we've fallen short of Phase 3.
[02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:21.630]  I'm a little bit disappointed.
[02:42:21.630 --> 02:42:23.630]  Phase 3 is holding these people accountable.
[02:42:23.630 --> 02:42:24.630]  And we're not seeing any—
[02:42:24.630 --> 02:42:27.630]  And Rand Paul's trying, but the FBI, what do you respond to him?
[02:42:27.630 --> 02:42:31.630]  Yeah, and it's the same thing in Toronto.
[02:42:31.630 --> 02:42:42.630]  We actually filed an election fraud lawsuit, two election fraud lawsuits, for the Toronto mayoral election, July 21st, 2023.
[02:42:42.630 --> 02:42:47.630]  And we are still awaiting an initial acceptance of the filing and a response from the government.
[02:42:47.630 --> 02:42:51.630]  Well, that's why they're so arrogant, is because they control federal law enforcement.
[02:42:51.630 --> 02:42:52.630]  We'll be right back with Chris Skye.
[02:42:52.630 --> 02:42:53.630]  Stay with us.
[02:43:21.630 --> 02:43:27.630]  You can find this same CBD oil for 30% more, because that's who we're getting it from.
[02:43:27.630 --> 02:43:30.630]  Made right here in Central Texas.
[02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:33.630]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[02:43:33.630 --> 02:43:39.630]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.
[02:43:39.630 --> 02:43:42.630]  It's based right here in Texas, and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[02:43:42.630 --> 02:43:44.630]  And here's what's even crazier.
[02:43:44.630 --> 02:43:46.630]  30% off of what they're selling it for.
[02:43:46.630 --> 02:43:49.630]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[02:43:49.630 --> 02:43:53.630]  So this is the highest rated, already the lowest price, now even a lower price.
[02:43:53.630 --> 02:43:57.630]  Rebel Zen. Get yours at InfoWareStore.com now.
[02:43:57.630 --> 02:44:04.630]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[02:44:04.630 --> 02:44:07.630]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[02:44:07.630 --> 02:44:15.630]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[02:44:15.630 --> 02:44:18.630]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[02:44:18.630 --> 02:44:24.630]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison, and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[02:44:24.630 --> 02:44:29.630]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury,
[02:44:29.630 --> 02:44:32.630]  who was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time.
[02:44:32.630 --> 02:44:39.630]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[02:44:39.630 --> 02:44:41.630]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[02:44:41.630 --> 02:44:46.630]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[02:44:46.630 --> 02:44:52.630]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water, and a remedy to this madness.
[02:44:52.630 --> 02:44:56.630]  Available now at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:44:57.630 --> 02:45:04.630]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[02:45:04.630 --> 02:45:09.630]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element,
[02:45:09.630 --> 02:45:13.630]  which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[02:45:13.630 --> 02:45:15.630]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[02:45:15.630 --> 02:45:18.630]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[02:45:18.630 --> 02:45:23.630]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics
[02:45:23.630 --> 02:45:27.630]  that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[02:45:27.630 --> 02:45:32.630]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[02:45:32.630 --> 02:45:37.630]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface,
[02:45:37.630 --> 02:45:43.630]  our InfoWare's Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[02:45:43.630 --> 02:45:49.630]  Pure, nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.

[02:46:01.630 --> 02:46:03.630]  high quality bone broth there is.

[02:46:07.630 --> 02:46:11.630]  Then a huge dose of chaga mushroom, a massive dose of bee pollen,
[02:46:11.630 --> 02:46:16.630]  a gigantic dose of highest quality turmeric, and then it just gets crazier from there.
[02:46:16.630 --> 02:46:19.630]  It's about to sell out. We haven't had it in stock for years.
[02:46:19.630 --> 02:46:21.630]  This first new run is about to sell out.

[02:46:58.630 --> 02:47:05.630]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:06.800 --> 02:47:26.960]  Don't forget, Chris Skyes is going to be hosting the next hour, about to take Jim, Frank, Steve
[02:47:26.960 --> 02:47:27.960]  and Henry's calls.
[02:47:27.960 --> 02:47:34.679]  An hour and about 15 minutes, Owen Schroyer takes over with The War Room, 3 p.m., weekday
[02:47:34.679 --> 02:47:35.679]  central.
[02:47:35.679 --> 02:47:36.679]  It's powerful.
[02:47:36.679 --> 02:47:39.679]  We'll be right back.
[02:47:39.679 --> 02:47:45.199]  ...spreads its tendrils across the universe, one hero rises against the immeasurable might
[02:47:45.199 --> 02:47:46.199]  of the globalists.
[02:47:46.199 --> 02:47:51.320]  Tune in and trust in the power of the truth to lead us to victory in the great Info War.
[02:47:51.320 --> 02:47:56.080]  Prepare for the ultimate battle for truth with today's War Room broadcast.
[02:47:56.080 --> 02:48:00.279]  Now, it's your host, Owen Schroyer and his intrepid crew.
[02:48:00.279 --> 02:48:05.679]  Find the show and share the links at infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:48:05.679 --> 02:48:12.640]  Alright, I want to take these calls, you'll be able to host next hour.
[02:48:12.640 --> 02:48:16.800]  What are you going to be covering next hour and what else is on your radar screen?
[02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:21.920]  Well, I want to be covering exactly why I'm here in the U.S., where I'm going to be going
[02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:24.400]  from here and why I'm doing what I'm doing.
[02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:25.759]  That's going to be the main thing.
[02:48:25.759 --> 02:48:29.019]  And basically, it's a message for all of humanity.
[02:48:29.019 --> 02:48:33.840]  We want to network, we want to combine people's resources, we want to combine people's connections,
[02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:35.800]  we want to combine people's voices.
[02:48:35.800 --> 02:48:41.439]  And we want to get one singular message that freedom is not something that can be taken
[02:48:41.439 --> 02:48:42.439]  from us.
[02:48:42.439 --> 02:48:45.560]  And freedom is essential, not just in the United States, not just in Canada, but in
[02:48:45.560 --> 02:48:47.320]  every country around the world.
[02:48:47.320 --> 02:48:52.480]  Otherwise, they're going to do what they did globally on a global scale, but they're going
[02:48:52.480 --> 02:48:56.439]  to target each individual country one by one and take them out that way.
[02:48:56.439 --> 02:48:57.439]  That's right.
[02:48:57.439 --> 02:48:58.439]  The first lockdown was beta.
[02:48:58.439 --> 02:49:00.599]  They even admit that to size up each nation.
[02:49:00.599 --> 02:49:01.599]  Exactly.
[02:49:01.599 --> 02:49:03.439]  They have to see which nations are going to be compliant.
[02:49:03.439 --> 02:49:05.720]  They have to see which nations are going to fight back.
[02:49:05.720 --> 02:49:12.160]  And then they can tweak the individual programs per country to get the maximum compliance
[02:49:12.160 --> 02:49:15.920]  and the maximum benefit for themselves the next time they try it again.
[02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:16.920]  That's right.
[02:49:16.920 --> 02:49:17.920]  The sociologists have to tweak it.
[02:49:17.920 --> 02:49:21.119]  And there's a little bit of tickets left that will definitely be sold out if you want
[02:49:21.119 --> 02:49:22.880]  to go to this Saturday's event.
[02:49:22.880 --> 02:49:23.880]  What is it like?
[02:49:23.880 --> 02:49:27.400]  Seven to midnight there at the Vulcan Gas Company on Sixth Street, right next to Joe
[02:49:27.400 --> 02:49:28.400]  Rogan's club.
[02:49:28.400 --> 02:49:29.679]  That's where he was for the last two years.
[02:49:29.679 --> 02:49:32.320]  He built his own club, AmericanLibertyAwards.com.
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:34.240]  I'm going to be popping in.
[02:49:34.240 --> 02:49:39.519]  Matt Baker's going to be there, Owen Schroyer, of course, Chris Sky, and so many others.
[02:49:39.519 --> 02:49:40.640]  You want to be there?
[02:49:40.640 --> 02:49:41.640]  It's this Saturday.
[02:49:41.640 --> 02:49:49.519]  And we'll put that URL back on screen, AmericanLibertyAwards.com, if you want to come.
[02:49:49.519 --> 02:49:50.519]  AmericanLibertyAwards.com.
[02:49:50.519 --> 02:49:51.519]  All right.
[02:49:51.519 --> 02:49:54.840]  I want to take some of these phone calls.
[02:49:54.840 --> 02:49:59.640]  Let's go ahead and talk to, before we go to Steven in South Carolina, I want to ask, he's
[02:49:59.640 --> 02:50:00.920]  on Trump indictment.
[02:50:00.920 --> 02:50:02.519]  What is your view on Trump?
[02:50:02.519 --> 02:50:03.800]  On the indictment or in general?
[02:50:03.800 --> 02:50:06.920]  The indictment, him pushing the shots, do you think he's a good guy, bad guy?
[02:50:06.920 --> 02:50:10.720]  Well, on the indictment, I know a lot about getting charged frivolously.
[02:50:10.720 --> 02:50:14.640]  I know a lot about getting charged with fake charges, with politically motivated charges,
[02:50:14.640 --> 02:50:17.199]  and having your name characteristically assassinated.
[02:50:17.199 --> 02:50:19.000]  So I believe that's exactly what's happening to him.
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.080]  I don't think he's going to be found guilty of anything.
[02:50:21.080 --> 02:50:24.599]  I think it is going to be a long, drawn-out court battle, expensive, not that that matters
[02:50:24.599 --> 02:50:25.599]  for him.
[02:50:25.599 --> 02:50:28.720]  But it is going to, they are going to try to tarnish his name and hurt him politically
[02:50:28.720 --> 02:50:30.080]  as much as possible.
[02:50:30.080 --> 02:50:32.960]  It's about pinning him down with all these charges while he's trying to run.
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:33.960]  Of course.
[02:50:33.960 --> 02:50:34.960]  That's exactly what they do.
[02:50:34.960 --> 02:50:38.199]  Because the more charges they put on you, the more resources and time you have to dedicate
[02:50:38.199 --> 02:50:39.199]  to this.
[02:50:39.199 --> 02:50:42.599]  That's less resources and time that you can dedicate to your political campaign or any
[02:50:42.599 --> 02:50:44.859]  of your business ventures or even your family.
[02:50:44.859 --> 02:50:46.279]  So it's just a way to slow you down.
[02:50:46.279 --> 02:50:47.320]  It's a way to bog you up.
[02:50:47.320 --> 02:50:48.599]  It's a way to put you off course.
[02:50:48.599 --> 02:50:50.439]  It's a way to dishearten you.
[02:50:50.439 --> 02:50:54.640]  It's a way to ultimately make you unsuccessful in whatever it is you're trying to do.
[02:50:54.640 --> 02:50:58.359]  And that's the only way we can get out of the mud here, which we've basically done,
[02:50:58.359 --> 02:51:03.160]  and expand, not just survive, is people go to infowarestore.com, get Vitamin Mineral

[02:51:10.519 --> 02:51:11.519]  neurological systems.

[02:51:38.519 --> 02:51:41.199]  People say, well, you're selling out, why do you not have money?
[02:51:41.199 --> 02:51:43.480]  We don't even have enough money to always have it in stock.
[02:51:43.480 --> 02:51:46.119]  We're trying to get back where everything's in stock all the time.
[02:51:46.119 --> 02:51:48.840]  We can launch new products, new t-shirts, new books, new films.
[02:51:48.840 --> 02:51:50.320]  We're almost there.
[02:51:50.320 --> 02:51:51.720]  We're in the black a little bit.
[02:51:51.720 --> 02:51:52.840]  We need you to support us.
[02:51:52.840 --> 02:51:55.480]  I thank you for your support, infowarestore.com.
[02:51:55.480 --> 02:51:56.480]  Okay.
[02:51:56.480 --> 02:51:59.960]  Let's go to Steve, then Henry, and then Jim.
[02:51:59.960 --> 02:52:01.560]  Steve, you're on the air with Chris Sky.
[02:52:01.560 --> 02:52:02.560]  Go ahead.
[02:52:02.560 --> 02:52:08.480]  Hey, thanks, Alex, and Chris, thank you for everything that you've done.
[02:52:08.480 --> 02:52:12.199]  You've been an inspiration to me in the fight against the fake COVID.
[02:52:12.199 --> 02:52:16.840]  Well, let me just stop you, absolutely been an inspiration.
[02:52:16.840 --> 02:52:18.439]  You have been a hard charger.
[02:52:18.439 --> 02:52:19.439]  He's not a whiner.
[02:52:19.439 --> 02:52:25.400]  When he tells you he's persecuted, they have bird-dogged the hell out of you.
[02:52:25.400 --> 02:52:26.400]  That's 100% true.
[02:52:26.400 --> 02:52:34.240]  Actually, I talked to a person who's a senior investigator at the OIPIRD, and that is the
[02:52:34.240 --> 02:52:39.480]  branch of police investigations who investigates officers and decides whether charges should
[02:52:39.480 --> 02:52:41.320]  be filed against officers.
[02:52:41.320 --> 02:52:46.439]  And I asked him if there's anybody in Canadian history who has been charged, not just arrested,
[02:52:46.439 --> 02:52:49.199]  but charged with more crimes than I have.
[02:52:49.199 --> 02:52:53.460]  And I'm in the 70s now, and I still have zero convictions.
[02:52:53.460 --> 02:52:56.480]  And she actually looked into it for me, and she got back to me, and she confirmed that
[02:52:56.480 --> 02:53:01.359]  there's no other person in Canadian history, at least, that's been charged more times and
[02:53:01.359 --> 02:53:02.560]  still not a criminal.
[02:53:02.560 --> 02:53:03.560]  So that means one of two things.
[02:53:03.560 --> 02:53:08.640]  It means either I'm the luckiest man alive, or it means that I'm being illegally targeted
[02:53:08.640 --> 02:53:10.039]  and persecuted by the government.
[02:53:10.039 --> 02:53:12.080]  And by the way, I looked into you.
[02:53:12.080 --> 02:53:14.000]  You're a successful builder.
[02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:15.000]  You had no criminal record.
[02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:18.119]  I mean, you're a guy that got pissed about this, and they're trying to destroy you, which
[02:53:18.119 --> 02:53:19.679]  again is a badge of courage.
[02:53:19.679 --> 02:53:24.480]  Well, it's not even that I got pissed, it's that I saw necessity to act, not just for my
[02:53:24.480 --> 02:53:28.119]  own business, because we're not a business, like you said, we're in development and building.
[02:53:28.119 --> 02:53:31.160]  We're not a business that just pays our rent and pays a few employees.
[02:53:31.160 --> 02:53:33.439]  We have large financial obligations.
[02:53:33.439 --> 02:53:39.119]  But in reality, the small business sector is the backbone of the North American economy.
[02:53:39.119 --> 02:53:43.400]  It makes up over 95% of the businesses in all of Canada and the States, and it's linked
[02:53:43.400 --> 02:53:46.320]  to around 70% of the jobs in Canada and the States.
[02:53:46.320 --> 02:53:51.400]  And during COVID, and not because of COVID, let's be very frank here, because of government
[02:53:51.400 --> 02:53:58.840]  policies to supposedly combat COVID, we lost about 30% of all the small businesses in both
[02:53:58.840 --> 02:53:59.840]  countries.
[02:53:59.840 --> 02:54:00.840]  It's a war against prosperity.
[02:54:00.840 --> 02:54:01.840]  They're cutting off the pipeline.
[02:54:01.840 --> 02:54:02.840]  Sorry to interrupt, Steve.
[02:54:02.840 --> 02:54:03.840]  Go ahead.
[02:54:03.840 --> 02:54:04.840]  Oh, that's fine.
[02:54:04.840 --> 02:54:11.039]  I mean, you know, everything that you have done and everything that Chris has done and
[02:54:11.039 --> 02:54:15.759]  all of the books that I sit here and have read, whether it's Klaus Schwab's COVID-19,
[02:54:15.759 --> 02:54:21.920]  The Great Reset, your book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, RFK Jr.'s book,
[02:54:21.920 --> 02:54:26.800]  The Real Anthony Fauci, Ed Dowd's book, Cause Unknown, and I can go on and on.
[02:54:26.800 --> 02:54:30.119]  Richard Fleming, Is COVID-19 a Bioweapon?
[02:54:30.119 --> 02:54:37.480]  You know, it is an information war, and everything that they are doing to us right now, and Chris
[02:54:37.560 --> 02:54:42.359]  has talked about this when I've heard him through the years.
[02:54:42.359 --> 02:54:44.359]  It's all a distraction.
[02:54:44.359 --> 02:54:49.439]  It's to get us away from what they're really doing to us.
[02:54:49.439 --> 02:54:56.320]  They're hammering us from every direction, and when your guys were asking me what did
[02:54:56.320 --> 02:55:02.160]  I want to talk about, you know, the geoengineering that they're doing, the spraying of the barium
[02:55:02.160 --> 02:55:04.880]  salts and aluminum dioxide.
[02:55:04.880 --> 02:55:09.039]  In South Carolina here, I've been telling people about this.
[02:55:09.039 --> 02:55:14.920]  I've taken pictures when it's really been bad, and like the last week, it's just, you
[02:55:14.920 --> 02:55:20.920]  don't see a blue sky anymore, and this is one of the things that they are constantly
[02:55:20.920 --> 02:55:28.439]  hitting us with every single day through the whole country, and if we don't stop it, they're
[02:55:28.439 --> 02:55:29.640]  going to kill us all.
[02:55:29.640 --> 02:55:31.359]  That's Agenda 2030.
[02:55:31.359 --> 02:55:33.039]  They want to kill all of us.
[02:55:33.199 --> 02:55:37.640]  Well, the aluminum alone is killing the trees and the plants, and so much of the soil now
[02:55:37.640 --> 02:55:40.640]  is infertile because of it.
[02:55:40.640 --> 02:55:41.640]  Really great point, Steve.
[02:55:41.640 --> 02:55:42.640]  Thank you.
[02:55:42.640 --> 02:55:43.640]  Comments on that?
[02:55:43.640 --> 02:55:44.640]  I couldn't hear anything he was saying.
[02:55:44.640 --> 02:55:46.080]  Your earpiece must have popped out.
[02:55:46.080 --> 02:55:47.080]  No, no.
[02:55:47.080 --> 02:55:49.720]  My earpiece is in, but I could only hear the first guy talking and the second guy that
[02:55:49.720 --> 02:55:50.720]  came through.
[02:55:50.720 --> 02:55:57.679]  It must have unplugged out of the thing there, but we're going to have them come plug you
[02:55:57.679 --> 02:55:58.679]  in.
[02:55:58.679 --> 02:55:59.679]  You know, that's one issue we hear.
[02:55:59.679 --> 02:56:03.439]  These plugs are too short, and I don't know why I haven't complained to the crew that
[02:56:03.439 --> 02:56:07.759]  we need to get extensions on these, because it's an ongoing issue that happens.
[02:56:07.759 --> 02:56:11.599]  We may have to change the audio system we use, or maybe have the guests go to a wireless
[02:56:11.599 --> 02:56:14.640]  system so this stops happening, but this is an ongoing thing.
[02:56:14.640 --> 02:56:17.599]  I'm not bitching, but it seems like when I say something on air, we tend to fix it
[02:56:17.599 --> 02:56:19.640]  so people can actually hear what's going on.
[02:56:19.640 --> 02:56:22.160]  He was bringing up the geoengineering, the chemtrailing.
[02:56:22.160 --> 02:56:26.980]  Oh, well, people are still in denial that it exists, even though I actually posted job
[02:56:26.980 --> 02:56:32.019]  offerings online that were showing people exactly what type of aircraft they were going
[02:56:32.019 --> 02:56:36.300]  to be using, exactly what type of spraying system they're using, and they actually have
[02:56:36.300 --> 02:56:39.699]  two separate categories, geoengineering, cloud seeding.
[02:56:39.699 --> 02:56:41.859]  So people say that cloud seeding is geoengineering.
[02:56:41.859 --> 02:56:43.119]  No, it's not.
[02:56:43.119 --> 02:56:44.900]  Cloud seeding is cloud seeding.
[02:56:44.900 --> 02:56:49.060]  Geoengineering is spraying God knows what into the sky to affect the climate in ways
[02:56:49.060 --> 02:56:51.019]  that they determine need to be done.
[02:56:51.019 --> 02:56:52.019]  That's right.
[02:56:52.019 --> 02:56:54.820]  Cloud seeding is like a place in Colorado pays to have it done to make sure there's
[02:56:54.820 --> 02:56:55.820]  snow on the ground.
[02:56:55.820 --> 02:56:56.820]  Exactly.
[02:56:56.820 --> 02:56:57.820]  It's a place to have snow.
[02:56:57.820 --> 02:56:58.820]  Yeah.
[02:56:58.820 --> 02:56:59.820]  Create precipitation.
[02:56:59.820 --> 02:57:01.420]  Geoengineering is the whole planet wide.
[02:57:01.420 --> 02:57:02.420]  Yes.
[02:57:02.420 --> 02:57:04.340]  And they're doing it specifically in different areas.
[02:57:04.340 --> 02:57:08.380]  They're spraying these heavy metals and other toxic substances that inevitably make their
[02:57:08.380 --> 02:57:13.599]  way down, not only into our food supply, but contaminating the soil, contaminating our skin.
[02:57:13.599 --> 02:57:16.779]  And we're seeing all different types of side effects from this, from this type.
[02:57:16.779 --> 02:57:17.779]  All right.
[02:57:17.779 --> 02:57:18.779]  I'm going to do two more segments with Chris Scott.
[02:57:18.779 --> 02:57:19.779]  He takes over the last 45 minutes.
[02:57:19.779 --> 02:57:21.699]  They'll be on The War Room as well.
[02:57:21.699 --> 02:57:24.580]  And Harrison Smith's American Journal, 8 a.m. tomorrow.
[02:57:24.580 --> 02:57:27.539]  Henry and Jim, you held over before our guests got here.
[02:57:27.539 --> 02:57:32.060]  I'm going to go to you when we start our number four today.
[02:57:32.060 --> 02:57:37.980]  And then in T-minus 63 minutes, Owen Schroer and The War Room.
[02:57:37.980 --> 02:57:41.900]  So be sure and tune into that and share those links because if you don't, we're screwed.
[02:57:41.900 --> 02:57:43.140]  You take action, we win.
[02:57:43.140 --> 02:57:48.019]  It's all up to you.
[02:57:48.019 --> 02:57:52.699]  Tell us about the products, how we support you, how we support all of ourselves and the
[02:57:52.699 --> 02:57:53.699]  big event coming up.
[02:57:53.699 --> 02:57:54.699]  Well, yeah.
[02:57:54.699 --> 02:57:55.699]  That's the first one.
[02:57:55.699 --> 02:58:01.179]  You obviously can go to MyPillow.com, use that promo code, Alex, and you can get all
[02:58:01.179 --> 02:58:03.859]  these great discounts on all of our products.
[02:58:03.859 --> 02:58:09.580]  And just by visiting this site, you're going to get a $20 free gift emailed to you immediately.
[02:58:09.580 --> 02:58:13.900]  And there's the biggest special we have right now, the 20 year anniversary, MyPillow for
[02:58:13.900 --> 02:58:18.460]  $19.98 for the queen size, normally $69.98.
[02:58:18.460 --> 02:58:23.539]  We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love to invest, producing and
[02:58:23.539 --> 02:58:25.300]  making the MyPillow.
[02:58:25.300 --> 02:58:32.420]  And the model of businessmen and women with can-do know-how, using the money for Americana
[02:58:32.420 --> 02:58:34.939]  freedom to fight the globalists is what they fear.
[02:58:34.939 --> 02:58:36.420]  That's what the debanking is about.
[02:58:36.420 --> 02:58:38.220]  That's what the financial attacks are about.
[02:58:38.220 --> 02:58:43.099]  That's why we've got a rush to support MyPillow.com and InfoWars.com, plus their great products
[02:58:43.099 --> 02:58:45.740]  at both places, because we are the tip of the spear.
[02:58:48.740 --> 02:58:54.060]  We finally have our original best-selling colloidal silver back in stock.
[02:58:54.060 --> 02:58:58.580]  With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems of the economy, we could not get
[02:58:58.580 --> 02:59:03.779]  the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.
[02:59:03.779 --> 02:59:08.820]  But now we've got it 30 parts per million from the top lab, we've got a limited shipment.
[02:59:08.820 --> 02:59:10.900]  Hopefully, we'll have a lot of it in the future.
[02:59:10.900 --> 02:59:15.900]  But if you want to experience and have in your medicine cabinet, have in your preparedness
[02:59:15.900 --> 02:59:21.220]  arsenal, high-quality colloidal silver from the best manufacturer, we have it right now

[02:59:45.900 --> 02:59:55.900]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:15.900 --> 03:00:29.740]  All right, Chris Skye is going to co-host and take over here in about 15 minutes.
[03:00:29.740 --> 03:00:31.340]  We're getting your calls right now.
[03:00:31.340 --> 03:00:33.380]  Let's go to Henry in Chicago.
[03:00:33.380 --> 03:00:34.380]  You're on the air.
[03:00:34.380 --> 03:00:35.380]  Go ahead.
[03:00:35.380 --> 03:00:36.380]  Hi, Alex.
[03:00:36.380 --> 03:00:37.380]  Hi, Chris.
[03:00:37.380 --> 03:00:38.460]  I wanted to plug in your product.
[03:00:38.460 --> 03:00:43.619]  I'm happy taking the Nitric Boost, the X2 and the X3.
[03:00:43.619 --> 03:00:51.300]  I'm calling because Fauci, you can look it up, it's October 2014, Fauci letter authorized
[03:00:51.300 --> 03:00:56.380]  gain-of-function research, and we need to prosecute this guy and take his money away
[03:00:56.380 --> 03:00:57.380]  on their-
[03:00:57.380 --> 03:01:00.460]  By the way, we should have a record skip noise or a car wreck sound there.
[03:01:00.460 --> 03:01:01.939]  Yeah, he wrote a bunch of letters.
[03:01:01.939 --> 03:01:07.820]  He funded conferences called in favor of gain-of-function, and then he tells Congress they never did it,
[03:01:07.820 --> 03:01:10.580]  he should go directly to prison, but he doesn't.
[03:01:10.580 --> 03:01:11.580]  Right.
[03:01:11.580 --> 03:01:15.900]  And then they should take his money on the Article 1, Section 6, Paragraph 2.
[03:01:15.900 --> 03:01:20.259]  It's a moment, profit arising from office in an office.
[03:01:20.259 --> 03:01:31.619]  He's got $332 million payments in royalty with him and his partner, $335 million on top of
[03:01:31.619 --> 03:01:34.779]  all the other stuff that he sold from us.
[03:01:34.779 --> 03:01:35.779]  I agree.
[03:01:35.779 --> 03:01:42.420]  What do we do, then, Jim, or Henry, about a captured Justice Department that literally
[03:01:42.420 --> 03:01:46.820]  lets them commit all these crimes while they persecute Trump for nothing?
[03:01:46.820 --> 03:01:47.820]  I have the solution.
[03:01:47.820 --> 03:01:56.859]  Why don't we designate the WEF, the WHO, the Justice Department, the FBI, the IRS, and
[03:01:56.859 --> 03:01:59.380]  all that as terrorist organizations?
[03:01:59.380 --> 03:02:03.539]  Well, they've listed the American people as terrorist organizations.
[03:02:03.539 --> 03:02:07.340]  I'm not even blaming the mid-level FBI agents, because the truth is, they're just doing regular
[03:02:07.340 --> 03:02:08.340]  jobs.
[03:02:08.340 --> 03:02:09.340]  It is the top.
[03:02:09.340 --> 03:02:13.179]  Let me ask Chris Stratton, what do you do, like you have in Canada, with a governor general
[03:02:13.179 --> 03:02:16.220]  that really controls your parliament, they can suspend parliament any time, you're really
[03:02:16.220 --> 03:02:19.580]  still under the British crown, we're now under the new crown, the Justice Department.
[03:02:19.580 --> 03:02:22.380]  What do you do when corrupt groups hijack the government?
[03:02:22.380 --> 03:02:25.820]  Well, that's what we're dealing with right now, and that's why I said we really haven't
[03:02:25.820 --> 03:02:29.939]  achieved Phase 3 of united noncompliance, of holding these people accountable, and him
[03:02:29.939 --> 03:02:32.220]  talking about Fauci is a perfect example.
[03:02:32.220 --> 03:02:36.099]  We have emails that Fauci knew they were lying to the people, we have the gain of
[03:02:36.099 --> 03:02:38.460]  function research, and then what did Fauci do?
[03:02:38.460 --> 03:02:43.220]  He took his $330 million, he called it quits, he retired, and he took his golden parachute
[03:02:43.220 --> 03:02:44.220]  and flew away.
[03:02:44.220 --> 03:02:47.900]  Now he's hiding out, he's got his money, and he didn't get any charges, he didn't get any
[03:02:47.900 --> 03:02:48.900]  credit.
[03:02:48.900 --> 03:02:51.699]  And taxpayers illegally pay for federal marshals to guard him.
[03:02:51.699 --> 03:02:52.699]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:02:52.699 --> 03:02:53.699]  Illegal!
[03:02:53.699 --> 03:02:54.699]  It's fraud!
[03:02:54.699 --> 03:02:59.099]  If a federal marshal picked up a hamburger for you on the job, that's a felony.
[03:02:59.099 --> 03:03:05.460]  They're literally like six agents, 24 hours a day, not on the books, paid for by the feds.
[03:03:05.460 --> 03:03:08.019]  It's lawlessness, lawlessness, lawlessness.
[03:03:08.019 --> 03:03:10.980]  And that's what they're doing, they're using lawlessness on top of lawlessness, and that's
[03:03:10.980 --> 03:03:17.179]  why you can try to change things from a municipal standpoint, politically, locally, or you can
[03:03:17.179 --> 03:03:21.380]  do what we've been trying to do, and that's unite people all around the world under the
[03:03:21.380 --> 03:03:25.179]  auspice that the government is not your friend, all these things they're trying to do are
[03:03:25.179 --> 03:03:29.740]  not for your own interest, and the best thing you can do is simply just say no.
[03:03:29.740 --> 03:03:32.380]  Let's talk about phase three when we come back, it's a one-minute break, some stations
[03:03:32.380 --> 03:03:33.380]  join us.
[03:03:33.380 --> 03:03:35.740]  Henry, you've got 60 seconds for closing comments, great point.
[03:03:35.740 --> 03:03:40.500]  Okay, thank you, all I've got to say, we've got to fight for our republic, it's been
[03:03:40.500 --> 03:03:41.500]  taken over.
[03:03:41.500 --> 03:03:45.580]  We have to get rid of the Federal Reserve and the IRS, which are the mafia that's taking
[03:03:45.580 --> 03:03:48.580]  away our money, which is unconstitutional.
[03:03:48.580 --> 03:03:53.619]  And they're funding all the illegal blackout projects, and all the other stuff that they're
[03:03:53.619 --> 03:03:54.619]  doing.
[03:03:55.060 --> 03:04:00.060]  I agree, I mean, it's like you have a contractor repair your house while you're on vacation,
[03:04:00.060 --> 03:04:03.300]  and you come back and he's in your easy chair saying it's his house.
[03:04:03.300 --> 03:04:05.300]  I mean, it's BS.
[03:04:05.300 --> 03:04:09.699]  Well, there was no income tax before there was a Federal Reserve, and before there was
[03:04:09.699 --> 03:04:13.419]  a Federal Reserve, the United States dollar was always able to be traded for one ounce
[03:04:13.419 --> 03:04:15.380]  of silver, and now what do you have?
[03:04:15.380 --> 03:04:16.380]  Henry, great points.
[03:04:16.380 --> 03:04:21.060]  Look, at least we're identifying this coup, though, and I mean, I don't think the people
[03:04:21.060 --> 03:04:27.220]  of the Justice Department are happy campers, at least that's happening.
[03:04:27.220 --> 03:04:28.220]  Thank you, Henry.
[03:04:28.220 --> 03:04:31.019]  All right, we're going to come back with one more call, Jim in Kentucky, and I want to
[03:04:31.019 --> 03:04:34.859]  hit this big vaccine story and the pedophile story I mentioned earlier, and then you're
[03:04:34.859 --> 03:04:39.180]  going to be covering a lot of stuff in the next 45 minutes after that.
[03:04:39.180 --> 03:04:43.660]  Chris Sky, great to meet him in person, can't wait to be at the Liberty Awards this Saturday,
[03:04:43.660 --> 03:04:45.779]  and the tickets are almost all gone.
[03:04:45.779 --> 03:04:50.660]  You can go to theamericanlibertyawards.com, get the final tickets selling out now at the
[03:04:50.660 --> 03:04:58.140]  Vulcan Gas Company this Saturday on 6th Street, americanlibertyawards.com, I'll see you there.
[03:04:58.140 --> 03:05:02.820]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store, or like a vitamin shop.
[03:05:02.820 --> 03:05:06.220]  We want to have all the best brands for you, we want to have a bunch of different choices
[03:05:06.220 --> 03:05:07.220]  for you.
[03:05:07.220 --> 03:05:11.060]  So I get constant questions online and in person, hey, what's better, knockout?
[03:05:11.060 --> 03:05:13.140]  What's better, down and out?
[03:05:13.140 --> 03:05:14.140]  What's better?
[03:05:14.140 --> 03:05:15.859]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[03:05:15.859 --> 03:05:20.340]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different
[03:05:20.340 --> 03:05:21.340]  people.
[03:05:21.340 --> 03:05:25.580]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[03:05:25.580 --> 03:05:27.660]  That's how our bodies work, they're all very diverse.
[03:05:27.660 --> 03:05:32.340]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years
[03:05:32.340 --> 03:05:39.019]  that people love, and sold for a lower price, under the name Infowars MD Good Night Sleep.

[03:06:14.740 --> 03:06:21.699]  From Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:21.699 --> 03:06:28.140]  Here's the latest attack on RFK Jr., it's getting really crazy.
[03:06:28.140 --> 03:06:31.180]  This is Blueanon, worse than QAnon.
[03:06:31.180 --> 03:06:33.980]  My administration just denied a request.
[03:06:33.980 --> 03:06:37.140]  Okay, I'll stop there, because an important part's already been out there.
[03:06:37.140 --> 03:06:41.779]  Now what they're saying about this now, a tweet from the count of Democratic presidential
[03:06:41.779 --> 03:06:49.259]  candidate RFK, on Friday, used language that many observers say evokes the no Nazi hate
[03:06:49.259 --> 03:06:51.539]  symbol 1488.
[03:06:51.539 --> 03:06:56.580]  And so there, you put 14, and then, and they're saying that you did this intentionally.
[03:06:56.580 --> 03:06:59.580]  I also used the word 67 down there.
[03:06:59.580 --> 03:07:00.580]  Okay.
[03:07:00.580 --> 03:07:02.580]  Oh, down here, 67.
[03:07:02.580 --> 03:07:03.580]  Is that also bad?
[03:07:03.580 --> 03:07:10.419]  No, but I mean, I was, anyway, you can see at the bottom it says that it got, at that
[03:07:10.419 --> 03:07:14.180]  point that you photographed, it's got almost 30 million views.
[03:07:14.180 --> 03:07:15.180]  Yes.
[03:07:15.180 --> 03:07:21.419]  Oh, I think they were trying to figure out a way, somebody was, it got somebody's attention,
[03:07:21.419 --> 03:07:22.419]  let's put it that way.
[03:07:22.419 --> 03:07:28.419]  And you know, and those numbers came from Gavin DeBecker, who runs the, you know, the
[03:07:28.419 --> 03:07:38.460]  most, you know, the premier security agency in the country, and he was, he did my negotiations
[03:07:38.460 --> 03:07:39.460]  with the Secret Service.
[03:07:39.460 --> 03:07:45.199]  And the Secret Service, you know, his first contact with them was whatever, 88 days prior
[03:07:45.199 --> 03:07:53.619]  to the, you know, I think it was the 21st of July or whatever, when Mayorkas wrote me back.
[03:07:53.619 --> 03:07:58.340]  And so those numbers I got from him, I didn't, you know, invent those numbers.
[03:07:58.340 --> 03:08:05.140]  And but, but you know, it's, what's ironic about this, Jimmy, is that these are people
[03:08:05.140 --> 03:08:08.500]  who have been accusing me of being a conspiracy theorist.
[03:08:08.500 --> 03:08:09.500]  Yes.
[03:08:09.500 --> 03:08:10.500]  Yes.
[03:08:10.500 --> 03:08:15.740]  You need, you need a ball of red yarn to get this thing, you know.
[03:08:15.740 --> 03:08:19.099]  You got to twist yourself on a pretzel to come up with this one, man.
[03:08:19.099 --> 03:08:25.820]  This is amazing that this is like, wow, I was really almost tip of the hat for how crazy
[03:08:25.820 --> 03:08:26.820]  this is.
[03:08:26.820 --> 03:08:27.820]  And, but you know what?
[03:08:27.820 --> 03:08:29.460]  They're going to get people to believe it.
[03:08:29.460 --> 03:08:30.460]  You know?
[03:08:30.460 --> 03:08:31.460]  Yeah.
[03:08:31.779 --> 03:08:36.140]  And the reason I played that is, we have all the documents, we have all the admissions,
[03:08:36.140 --> 03:08:39.580]  they want to lock you up, climate lockdowns, forcibly inject you, world government, new
[03:08:39.580 --> 03:08:42.900]  world order, pedophiles, chopping children's genitals off.
[03:08:42.900 --> 03:08:46.019]  And the QAnon people are looking for code words and magic stuff.
[03:08:46.019 --> 03:08:48.019]  I know I heard there's a FEMA camp.
[03:08:48.019 --> 03:08:50.580]  Here's the documents for the camps worldwide run by the UN.
[03:08:50.580 --> 03:08:51.660]  Here's the UN treaty.
[03:08:51.660 --> 03:08:52.660]  Here it is.
[03:08:52.660 --> 03:08:57.099]  Here's the UN openly passing their new regulations saying sex with six-year-olds is okay if it's
[03:08:57.099 --> 03:08:58.900]  consensual, you know, they're not at the age of consent.
[03:08:58.900 --> 03:09:01.220]  I mean, I'm going to show you the UN report.
[03:09:01.980 --> 03:09:04.980]  But instead it's like, oh, there's hidden bases with kids in it.
[03:09:04.980 --> 03:09:09.900]  And then the Blue Anons even more insane where I said, you know, this Texas judge looks like
[03:09:09.900 --> 03:09:10.900]  a demonic goblin.
[03:09:10.900 --> 03:09:12.699]  And they go, anti-Semitic trope.
[03:09:12.699 --> 03:09:13.699]  She's not even Jewish.
[03:09:13.699 --> 03:09:14.699]  They just inject.
[03:09:14.699 --> 03:09:16.820]  I'm not even thinking about Jews.
[03:09:16.820 --> 03:09:17.820]  She looks like a goblin.
[03:09:17.820 --> 03:09:19.859]  She's not even Jewish.
[03:09:19.859 --> 03:09:20.859]  It's crazy.
[03:09:20.859 --> 03:09:24.419]  So let me show people some documents here and we'll take a final, we'll take a final
[03:09:24.419 --> 03:09:25.419]  phone call.
[03:09:25.419 --> 03:09:26.419]  I don't know what's going on with the audio system.
[03:09:26.419 --> 03:09:30.699]  I just lost my audio too, but we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll figure it
[03:09:30.699 --> 03:09:31.699]  out here in a minute.
[03:09:31.699 --> 03:09:38.380]  I may be, I may not be able to take a call now, but a historical vaccine safety concerns
[03:09:38.380 --> 03:09:39.859]  right here.
[03:09:39.859 --> 03:09:48.180]  And this is from the CDC's own website, CDC disease control and prevention.
[03:09:48.180 --> 03:09:49.180]  Okay.
[03:09:49.180 --> 03:09:55.619]  And then it says right here, simian virus SV 40 was put in the polio vaccines that the
[03:09:55.619 --> 03:09:59.539]  general public was given.
[03:10:00.419 --> 03:10:02.259]  Over a hundred million people got cancer.
[03:10:02.259 --> 03:10:06.619]  So I'm showing you the CDC's own document.
[03:10:06.619 --> 03:10:11.419]  So the epic times comes out monkey virus and DNA found in COVID-19 shots.
[03:10:11.419 --> 03:10:16.039]  That's according to a bunch of prestigious studies, microbiologist, Kevin Karen, a former
[03:10:16.039 --> 03:10:21.660]  researcher and team leader for the MIT human genome project has discovered massive DNA
[03:10:21.660 --> 03:10:27.500]  contamination in the MRNA COVID-19 shots, including simian virus 40 SV 40.
[03:10:27.500 --> 03:10:32.380]  Looked in, look at the crime being committed right here.
[03:10:32.380 --> 03:10:38.820]  Right now, ladies and gentlemen, Google, you type in monkey virus, MRNA COVID vaccine.
[03:10:38.820 --> 03:10:41.180]  They all tell you it's a conspiracy theory.
[03:10:41.180 --> 03:10:42.180]  Does it exist?
[03:10:42.180 --> 03:10:44.199]  They're doing this premeditatedly.
[03:10:44.199 --> 03:10:45.580]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[03:10:45.580 --> 03:10:46.580]  Chris Scott.
[03:10:46.580 --> 03:10:48.380]  Well, this is, this is the common tactic.
[03:10:48.380 --> 03:10:51.019]  We already know that they did that with the polio vaccine.
[03:10:51.019 --> 03:10:52.460]  It was common knowledge.
[03:10:52.460 --> 03:10:59.019]  There's literally multiple peer reviewed published medical journals talking about the contamination
[03:10:59.019 --> 03:11:03.660]  of the SV 40 virus, how it was given to tens of millions of Americans, how it could even
[03:11:03.660 --> 03:11:09.500]  be passed off to offspring and how it was a hundred percent the reason that so many Americans
[03:11:09.500 --> 03:11:10.500]  got cancer.
[03:11:10.500 --> 03:11:13.820]  We're now at the point of our lives where at least one in three people are going to
[03:11:13.820 --> 03:11:14.900]  get cancer.
[03:11:14.900 --> 03:11:16.220]  And it was not like that before.
[03:11:16.220 --> 03:11:18.539]  And it's not because people are eating worse.
[03:11:18.539 --> 03:11:21.580]  It's not because people are spending too much time out in the sun.
[03:11:21.699 --> 03:11:25.900]  It's because people are injecting more and more toxic poisons into their body.
[03:11:25.900 --> 03:11:30.060]  And the MRNA vaccine for the COVID vaccine was the worst of the worst.
[03:11:30.060 --> 03:11:34.259]  We already know all around the world that millions of people either suffered and were
[03:11:34.259 --> 03:11:38.660]  maimed for life or died specifically because of this shot.
[03:11:38.660 --> 03:11:43.900]  We already know for a fact that the Johnson and Johnson vaccine had to be discontinued
[03:11:43.900 --> 03:11:46.259]  and banned because it was causing too much damage.
[03:11:46.259 --> 03:11:50.580]  We already know that the AstraZeneca vaccine had to be banned because it was causing too
[03:11:50.580 --> 03:11:51.580]  much damage.
[03:11:51.580 --> 03:11:55.660]  We already know that the Moderna vaccine was banned by most of the developed world for
[03:11:55.660 --> 03:11:59.180]  young people because it was causing massive injuries to people's hearts.
[03:11:59.180 --> 03:12:03.220]  Meanwhile, there's another segment of the population that believes so much into big
[03:12:03.220 --> 03:12:07.939]  pharma and so much into government that they took five, six, seven of these shots, a monkey
[03:12:07.939 --> 03:12:13.099]  pox shot, a flu shot, an HPV vaccine, and they can't wait to take more.
[03:12:13.099 --> 03:12:17.740]  Now, if you're thinking about that and you're listening to us, think about it logically.
[03:12:17.740 --> 03:12:21.820]  Do you think any of these shots are actually going to make you healthier?
[03:12:21.820 --> 03:12:26.199]  Or do you think that every successive shot you get has a chance of getting you sicker
[03:12:26.199 --> 03:12:27.199]  and sicker?
[03:12:27.199 --> 03:12:28.779]  And the statistics show that's the case.
[03:12:28.779 --> 03:12:29.779]  So here's the deal.
[03:12:29.779 --> 03:12:33.300]  I have the CDC website saying this is in the shots, been in the shots.
[03:12:33.300 --> 03:12:34.699]  Now it's in the new shots.
[03:12:34.699 --> 03:12:37.660]  And they literally come in and say we're liars to hurt people.
[03:12:37.660 --> 03:12:38.660]  Yeah.
[03:12:38.660 --> 03:12:39.660]  And these are evil.
[03:12:39.660 --> 03:12:41.779]  Sergey Brin is a mass murderer.
[03:12:41.779 --> 03:12:45.060]  Well, it's Larry Page is wearing a little pink outfit.
[03:12:45.060 --> 03:12:46.419]  He does that as camouflage.
[03:12:46.419 --> 03:12:47.419]  They brag about it.
[03:12:48.099 --> 03:12:49.460]  Bill Gates wears pink to be non-threatening.
[03:12:49.460 --> 03:12:52.060]  If Hitler wore a pink uniform, he would have won.
[03:12:52.060 --> 03:12:53.060]  Seriously.
[03:12:53.060 --> 03:12:54.060]  People said he's wearing a pink uniform.
[03:12:54.060 --> 03:12:57.820]  If he'd have hired a bunch of housewives to be his generals, they'd have said, well, it's
[03:12:57.820 --> 03:12:58.820]  women.
[03:12:58.820 --> 03:12:59.820]  They're not threatening.
[03:12:59.820 --> 03:13:01.259]  Because epigenetically, we're not threatened by a guy in pink.
[03:13:01.259 --> 03:13:04.419]  Well, especially not a Bill Gates looking type of guy in pink.
[03:13:04.419 --> 03:13:05.419]  Absolutely.
[03:13:05.419 --> 03:13:06.419]  Let's take a final call.
[03:13:06.419 --> 03:13:07.980]  Then you get the seat right here and you take over.
[03:13:07.980 --> 03:13:09.580]  Let's talk to Jim in Kentucky.
[03:13:09.580 --> 03:13:11.740]  Thanks for holding your own here with Chris Sky.
[03:13:11.740 --> 03:13:12.740]  Yes.
[03:13:13.740 --> 03:13:19.259]  I called Rand Paul's office today and requested for Mr. Paul to go ahead and request from
[03:13:19.259 --> 03:13:26.660]  a judge to have Fauci's house inspected, including a laboratory that he's working with due to
[03:13:26.660 --> 03:13:31.300]  the China laboratory found in California.
[03:13:31.300 --> 03:13:34.340]  Using that as the link why to get the permit.
[03:13:34.340 --> 03:13:36.259]  Because Fauci's not out.
[03:13:36.259 --> 03:13:38.019]  He's definitely in and he's working on it.
[03:13:38.019 --> 03:13:39.019]  Oh, you're right.
[03:13:39.019 --> 03:13:41.619]  It came out a month ago that he's still secretly running everything.
[03:13:41.619 --> 03:13:42.619]  Exactly.
[03:13:42.699 --> 03:13:47.539]  Therefore, this new thing he's going to release, he's probably got in his hands now.
[03:13:47.539 --> 03:13:53.740]  And if Mr. Paul can get this done instead of trying to prosecute him for a past crime,
[03:13:53.740 --> 03:13:59.380]  he can prosecute him with the evidence of the crime going on right now.
[03:13:59.380 --> 03:14:01.019]  No, I totally agree.
[03:14:01.019 --> 03:14:04.539]  I mean, we're literally sitting here waiting for a known mass murderer that helped launch
[03:14:04.539 --> 03:14:06.300]  HIV and now this.
[03:14:06.300 --> 03:14:07.300]  He says something uneminent.
[03:14:07.300 --> 03:14:10.699]  Remember, he said Trump will be challenged by a virus in 2017.
[03:14:10.699 --> 03:14:12.180]  We're waiting for this mass murderer.
[03:14:12.740 --> 03:14:17.140]  We're waiting for a known killer to attack us again.
[03:14:17.140 --> 03:14:22.740]  That's why he needs to, you know, his house needs inspected, his laboratory needs inspected.
[03:14:22.740 --> 03:14:24.180]  Let them find another.
[03:14:24.180 --> 03:14:27.900]  We got total probable cause to give this guy a proctology exam.
[03:14:27.900 --> 03:14:35.460]  I'm just saying this is the evidence that's needed to prosecute him now.
[03:14:35.460 --> 03:14:38.980]  And that's why that's why he officially took himself out of the picture to buy himself
[03:14:38.980 --> 03:14:44.060]  another level of insulation from being investigated and from having exactly what you just described
[03:14:44.060 --> 03:14:45.060]  happened to him.
[03:14:45.060 --> 03:14:46.699]  And again, just like a great point, Jim.
[03:14:46.699 --> 03:14:47.699]  Thank you.
[03:14:47.699 --> 03:14:48.699]  Just like a pyromaniac.
[03:14:48.699 --> 03:14:49.699]  Great to have that be our last caller.
[03:14:49.699 --> 03:14:50.699]  Great point.
[03:14:50.699 --> 03:14:51.699]  A pyromaniac can't help it.
[03:14:51.699 --> 03:14:52.699]  Burn down buildings.
[03:14:52.699 --> 03:14:53.699]  Same thing with this guy.
[03:14:53.699 --> 03:14:54.699]  He can't help it.
[03:14:54.699 --> 03:14:55.699]  Release viruses.
[03:14:55.699 --> 03:14:56.699]  Well, that's what he's been doing for how many decades?
[03:14:56.699 --> 03:14:57.699]  Forty five years.
[03:14:57.699 --> 03:14:58.699]  Exactly.
[03:14:58.699 --> 03:15:00.380]  Well, all right.
[03:15:00.380 --> 03:15:01.380]  Great job, crew.
[03:15:01.380 --> 03:15:03.500]  Chris Sky takes over for 45 minutes.
[03:15:03.500 --> 03:15:07.220]  Then the mighty Owen Schroer, 3 p.m. central tune in.
[03:15:07.220 --> 03:15:08.859]  Spread the links to the war room.
[03:15:09.740 --> 03:15:10.740]  You're going to be back on the American Journal tomorrow.
[03:15:10.740 --> 03:15:12.900]  When are you on the war room?
[03:15:12.900 --> 03:15:13.900]  Sometime today.
[03:15:13.900 --> 03:15:14.900]  They didn't give me.
[03:15:14.900 --> 03:15:15.900]  Oh, beautiful.
[03:15:15.900 --> 03:15:16.900]  So you're going to be on the war room today.
[03:15:16.900 --> 03:15:17.900]  All right.
[03:15:17.900 --> 03:15:18.900]  Thank you to the crew.
[03:15:18.900 --> 03:15:19.900]  Thank you.
[03:15:19.900 --> 03:15:20.900]  Steven Crowder.
[03:15:20.900 --> 03:15:21.900]  Yesterday was amazing.
[03:15:21.900 --> 03:15:22.900]  Jones Crowder dot com.
[03:15:22.900 --> 03:15:23.900]  We got a free month over there with a new show to be launching.
[03:15:23.900 --> 03:15:25.180]  This is big stuff going on.
[03:15:25.180 --> 03:15:26.180]  You back us.
[03:15:26.180 --> 03:15:27.180]  We'll explode and defeat the globalists.
[03:15:27.180 --> 03:15:28.180]  You don't.
[03:15:28.180 --> 03:15:29.180]  We're all screwed.
[03:15:29.180 --> 03:15:30.180]  I think it's that simple.
[03:15:30.180 --> 03:15:32.740]  I want to commend you all for the great job you do.
[03:15:32.740 --> 03:15:36.580]  That means everybody from the listeners to the crew to our guests, everybody else.
[03:15:36.580 --> 03:15:37.580]  Of course.
[03:15:37.580 --> 03:15:38.580]  All glory to God.
[03:15:39.300 --> 03:15:42.340]  The sky gets in this chair coming back in four minutes.
[03:15:42.340 --> 03:15:43.340]  Get ready.
[03:15:43.340 --> 03:15:45.779]  And as I told you, who's coming up at three p.m.
[03:15:45.779 --> 03:15:46.779]  Oh, Troyer.
[03:15:46.779 --> 03:15:47.779]  All right.
[03:15:47.779 --> 03:15:48.779]  Infowars.com is the coordinates of Liberty.
[03:15:48.779 --> 03:15:49.779]  Everybody running out.
[03:15:49.779 --> 03:15:50.779]  Brian here.
[03:15:50.779 --> 03:15:51.779]  I want to thank Alex Jones and Infowars for offering scholarships to River University.
[03:15:51.779 --> 03:15:52.779]  Maybe you watching Infowars today and you don't know what to do with the program.

[03:19:55.200 --> 03:20:05.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:06.500 --> 03:20:35.140]  Hello everybody, we are back on InfoWars.
[03:20:35.140 --> 03:20:39.700]  You are with your host, Chris Sky, and first of all, I would just like to thank Alex and
[03:20:39.700 --> 03:20:42.220]  the crew for giving me this opportunity.
[03:20:42.220 --> 03:20:47.220]  And while I'm here, and while I have you all to myself, I want you guys to listen up.
[03:20:47.220 --> 03:20:49.340]  I want you guys to listen closely.
[03:20:49.340 --> 03:20:52.060]  Why am I here and not just on InfoWars?
[03:20:52.060 --> 03:20:54.100]  Why am I here in the United States?
[03:20:54.100 --> 03:20:56.820]  Why am I talking to you in the first place?
[03:20:56.820 --> 03:21:00.220]  Well, we did not finish our job.
[03:21:00.220 --> 03:21:01.380]  We fought back.
[03:21:01.380 --> 03:21:02.580]  We fought hard.
[03:21:02.580 --> 03:21:04.580]  We pushed back the COVID restrictions.
[03:21:04.580 --> 03:21:07.180]  But we did not stop the globalist agenda.
[03:21:07.180 --> 03:21:14.460]  All the same things that they want to institute with COVID, getting rid of individual responsibilities
[03:21:14.460 --> 03:21:19.260]  and individual freedoms, making us dependent on government, controlling our finances, controlling
[03:21:19.260 --> 03:21:26.340]  our mobility, control, control, control, is all still very much on the table.
[03:21:26.340 --> 03:21:30.060]  And we did not complete phase three of united noncompliance.
[03:21:30.060 --> 03:21:31.660]  Nobody's been thrown in jail.
[03:21:31.660 --> 03:21:33.200]  Nobody's been held accountable.
[03:21:33.200 --> 03:21:35.560]  People like Trudeau just shuffled their cabinet.
[03:21:35.560 --> 03:21:39.400]  People like Fauci just retired and they moved off into the shadows.
[03:21:39.400 --> 03:21:42.040]  People like Joe Biden are still in power.
[03:21:42.040 --> 03:21:44.160]  Nothing's happened to the medical establishment.
[03:21:44.160 --> 03:21:45.920]  Nothing's happened to big pharma.
[03:21:45.920 --> 03:21:47.280]  Nothing's happened to the media.
[03:21:47.280 --> 03:21:50.560]  All the people that have lied to you, all the people that have impoverished you, all
[03:21:50.560 --> 03:21:54.680]  the people that have taken advantage of you are still there and still talking.
[03:21:54.680 --> 03:22:00.480]  And now they're getting ready for another round of recession, another round of a so-called
[03:22:00.480 --> 03:22:02.320]  global climate crisis.
[03:22:02.320 --> 03:22:07.440]  And of course, another round of some type of pandemic COVID was the test run.
[03:22:07.440 --> 03:22:11.200]  They had to see how every individual country would respond.
[03:22:11.200 --> 03:22:17.160]  So now they can tweak their global response for every individual nation to get the maximum
[03:22:17.160 --> 03:22:18.920]  level of compliance.
[03:22:18.920 --> 03:22:25.860]  And it is more imperative than ever that we stand up not only as a nation, not only
[03:22:25.860 --> 03:22:34.660]  as a continent, but as a global voice with one idea, and that idea is freedom for all.
[03:22:34.660 --> 03:22:41.300]  And that is why I am embarking on what I called a tour to change the world.
[03:22:41.300 --> 03:22:47.580]  A few weeks ago, I was on an international show that had representatives from the United
[03:22:47.580 --> 03:22:51.540]  States, from Canada, from Australia and New Zealand.
[03:22:51.540 --> 03:22:54.940]  And we started off talking about voter fraud.
[03:22:54.940 --> 03:23:00.620]  And we all seem to notice that the very same methods of voter fraud were employed no matter
[03:23:00.620 --> 03:23:04.500]  what part of the world they were in, just like the COVID restrictions, just like the
[03:23:04.500 --> 03:23:06.260]  global climate restrictions.
[03:23:06.260 --> 03:23:10.780]  So this was a global problem and it needs a global solution.
[03:23:10.780 --> 03:23:13.020]  We need a global voice.
[03:23:13.020 --> 03:23:20.140]  And I said at the time, if I can get myself into the United States, the bastion of freedom,
[03:23:20.140 --> 03:23:25.900]  the largest standing army in the world, the people that care more about freedom and have
[03:23:25.900 --> 03:23:33.700]  a document called the Constitution that absolutely enshrines freedom into their daily lives,
[03:23:33.700 --> 03:23:35.940]  this would be the perfect place to start.
[03:23:35.940 --> 03:23:40.980]  And this would be the only country that I knew I would have trouble getting into.
[03:23:40.980 --> 03:23:45.820]  And after being arrested 27 times in the last three years, after facing over 70 criminal
[03:23:45.820 --> 03:23:51.260]  charges, I knew that no matter which way I tried to come into the United States, it
[03:23:51.260 --> 03:23:52.740]  wasn't going to be easy.
[03:23:52.740 --> 03:23:58.220]  And I knew it was going to be not a fun time, but I knew it was something I had to do.
[03:23:58.220 --> 03:23:59.700]  I knew it was the right thing.
[03:23:59.700 --> 03:24:05.340]  And I knew if I could successfully get into the United States, it would be a sign that
[03:24:05.340 --> 03:24:08.460]  I was on the right path and I had to do what I had to do.
[03:24:08.460 --> 03:24:10.820]  So I came up from Mexico.
[03:24:10.820 --> 03:24:12.060]  I took a bus.
[03:24:12.060 --> 03:24:13.580]  I got to the border.
[03:24:13.580 --> 03:24:15.660]  And sure enough, I got stopped.
[03:24:15.660 --> 03:24:17.140]  We set off an alarm.
[03:24:17.140 --> 03:24:18.140]  I got questioned.
[03:24:18.140 --> 03:24:23.500]  I got detained so long that shift change happened, got questioned again, got put in a cell,
[03:24:23.500 --> 03:24:25.740]  passed out for I don't even know how long.
[03:24:25.740 --> 03:24:28.940]  Then I had to do an interview while locked up to a chair.
[03:24:28.940 --> 03:24:32.980]  And I was completely at the discretion of the U.S.
[03:24:32.980 --> 03:24:34.900]  border control guards.
[03:24:34.900 --> 03:24:40.260]  If I was going to have entry into this country and if my purpose would be able to continue
[03:24:40.260 --> 03:24:45.100]  and if my tour to change the world would officially be able to actually happen.
[03:24:45.100 --> 03:24:49.300]  And after seven hours of being detained and seven hours of not knowing what was going
[03:24:49.300 --> 03:24:55.260]  to happen, these brave men and women showed that they value your constitution.
[03:24:55.260 --> 03:25:00.140]  They valued the rights and freedoms of a non-American citizen.
[03:25:00.140 --> 03:25:03.700]  And they granted me entry into the United States.
[03:25:03.700 --> 03:25:08.540]  And when I walked across that border into Texas, literally walked because my bus had
[03:25:08.540 --> 03:25:12.100]  long left me, I had never felt more proud.
[03:25:12.100 --> 03:25:15.100]  And I am not even an American citizen.
[03:25:15.100 --> 03:25:22.060]  So if I were you and I lived in the United States, every single morning I wake up, I would
[03:25:22.060 --> 03:25:25.980]  be thanking God that we have something called the Constitution.
[03:25:25.980 --> 03:25:31.500]  And I would be thanking God that your law enforcement officers truly believe in it, truly believe
[03:25:31.500 --> 03:25:33.980]  in freedom and truly believe in your country.
[03:25:33.980 --> 03:25:40.060]  Because after spending three years in a COVID ravaged Canada, I saw the complete opposite.
[03:25:40.060 --> 03:25:44.420]  I saw compliance with the government tyranny even in our law enforcement.
[03:25:44.420 --> 03:25:47.300]  And I did not see that kind of attitude that I saw here.
[03:25:47.300 --> 03:25:50.380]  And it let me know that I have come to the right place.
[03:25:50.380 --> 03:25:55.660]  The United States is the perfect place for me to start this world tour.
[03:25:55.660 --> 03:26:00.040]  And the idea is we need everybody to start thinking the same.
[03:26:00.040 --> 03:26:02.960]  We need everybody to understand that they have power.
[03:26:02.960 --> 03:26:08.480]  And we need everybody to be able to react in the same matter at the same time.
[03:26:08.480 --> 03:26:16.760]  When we can speak out in one voice, when we can just say no on a global scale, there is
[03:26:16.760 --> 03:26:22.480]  nothing these people can do except retreat into the darkness and give us our lives and
[03:26:22.480 --> 03:26:24.760]  give us our independence back.
[03:26:24.760 --> 03:26:30.760]  And I'm starting over here in Texas, basically, in my mind, this is probably the perfect place
[03:26:30.760 --> 03:26:31.800]  to start.
[03:26:31.800 --> 03:26:37.240]  But I'm going to be heading over from here through Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, on my
[03:26:37.240 --> 03:26:45.080]  way to Miami, then Vero Beach, then coming back through Texas to New Mexico, to Colorado.
[03:26:45.080 --> 03:26:46.960]  And that's only in the next two weeks.
[03:26:46.960 --> 03:26:49.480]  We still have a couple more weeks after that.
[03:26:49.480 --> 03:26:57.000]  And after I am finished in the United States, I am planning on going to Europe, UK, Ireland,
[03:26:57.000 --> 03:26:58.000]  Netherlands.
[03:26:58.000 --> 03:27:00.600]  And finally, I'm going to be heading off to Australia.
[03:27:00.600 --> 03:27:07.800]  Because I said, if I had to be, I would be the link that connects the Commonwealth around
[03:27:07.800 --> 03:27:08.800]  the world.
[03:27:08.800 --> 03:27:14.580]  I would be the one to bring a message that everybody can speak on together that is going
[03:27:14.580 --> 03:27:16.700]  to get them the result they want.
[03:27:16.700 --> 03:27:21.160]  And that result is going to be freedom and prosperity for all.
[03:27:21.160 --> 03:27:24.100]  An idea is more powerful than any man.
[03:27:24.100 --> 03:27:26.520]  An idea is more powerful than any law.
[03:27:26.520 --> 03:27:30.480]  An idea is more powerful than any tyrannical government.
[03:27:30.480 --> 03:27:38.400]  An idea that takes root and takes hold on a global scale in unison can defeat any tyranny
[03:27:38.400 --> 03:27:39.640]  they try.
[03:27:39.640 --> 03:27:44.160]  And make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, they are still trying.
[03:27:44.160 --> 03:27:51.700]  The climate change agenda is even more nefarious and even more dangerous than the COVID agenda.
[03:27:51.700 --> 03:27:52.840]  And let me explain.
[03:27:52.840 --> 03:27:56.160]  The COVID agenda worked because it played on your heartstrings.
[03:27:56.160 --> 03:27:59.500]  It made you feel like if you didn't go along, you're going to kill grandma, you're going
[03:27:59.500 --> 03:28:00.700]  to kill baby.
[03:28:00.700 --> 03:28:04.260]  And they told you it was only temporary.
[03:28:04.260 --> 03:28:07.540]  Climate crises last generations.
[03:28:07.540 --> 03:28:13.180]  They are literally trying to transform your way of life, not just for a few years, not
[03:28:13.180 --> 03:28:19.100]  just temporarily, but for you and your children's children's children's children.
[03:28:19.100 --> 03:28:25.340]  They are setting up a technocratic control grid that is literally foolproof because they
[03:28:25.340 --> 03:28:30.340]  know their kids are like Hunter Biden, crackheads that couldn't run up McDonald's.
[03:28:30.340 --> 03:28:33.700]  So how would they enslave a global population with tyranny?
[03:28:33.700 --> 03:28:34.700]  Simple.
[03:28:34.700 --> 03:28:37.020]  They set up a thing that does it for them.
[03:28:37.020 --> 03:28:38.820]  And we're going to talk about that when we come back.
[03:28:38.820 --> 03:28:41.940]  I don't know if they want me to take any calls, but I'd love to take some calls and talk to
[03:28:41.940 --> 03:28:46.740]  some people and we can talk more about what I plan to accomplish on this tour and what
[03:28:46.740 --> 03:28:51.860]  they plan on doing against you and your family in the coming months and how you can prevent
[03:28:51.860 --> 03:28:52.860]  it from harming you.
[03:28:52.860 --> 03:28:53.860]  Thank you guys.
[03:28:53.860 --> 03:28:54.860]  Be back.
[03:28:55.860 --> 03:28:58.380]  It's been three years since we had it.
[03:28:58.380 --> 03:29:00.380]  We got it back in stock.
[03:29:00.380 --> 03:29:04.740]  The amazing 30 parts per million, highest quality colloidal silver and all the great
[03:29:04.740 --> 03:29:07.700]  things and all the great uses back in stock.
[03:29:07.700 --> 03:29:08.700]  Limited supply.
[03:29:08.700 --> 03:29:12.300]  Infowarsstore.com 30 percent off.
[03:29:12.300 --> 03:29:17.900]  And it's a very limited supply, but we have it back.
[03:29:17.900 --> 03:29:22.780]  Infowarsstore.com silver bullet, colloidal silver, Infowarslife silver bullet, colloidal
[03:29:22.780 --> 03:29:24.540]  silver has returned.
[03:29:24.540 --> 03:29:30.580]  Silver bullet is the answer to Alex's extensive search for a powerful colloidal silver product
[03:29:30.580 --> 03:29:36.540]  that utilizes high quality processes to ensure for a truly unique product that has applications
[03:29:36.540 --> 03:29:38.820]  for both preparedness and regular use.
[03:29:38.820 --> 03:29:40.660]  It is amazing.
[03:29:40.660 --> 03:29:46.540]  It's got thousands of reviews, five star reviews, Infowarsstore.com.
[03:29:46.540 --> 03:29:50.060]  Silver bullet returns to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:29:50.060 --> 03:29:54.940]  And while you're there, get some super female vitality, some turbo force, some brain force
[03:29:54.940 --> 03:29:56.300]  and some brain force ultra.
[03:29:56.300 --> 03:29:57.300]  You wanted to plug RainForce.
[03:29:57.300 --> 03:29:58.300]  Do you like RainForce?
[03:29:58.300 --> 03:29:59.300]  Yeah.
[03:29:59.300 --> 03:30:00.300]  Yeah.
[03:30:00.300 --> 03:30:01.300]  So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[03:30:01.300 --> 03:30:03.340]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[03:30:03.340 --> 03:30:07.380]  Four books with Dr. Judy Mykovitz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now
[03:30:07.380 --> 03:30:09.660]  two books with Alex Jones.
[03:30:09.660 --> 03:30:13.020]  That's because I use brain force every day.
[03:30:13.020 --> 03:30:16.940]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[03:30:17.020 --> 03:30:20.900]  So I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[03:30:20.900 --> 03:30:26.300]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is brain force.
[03:30:26.300 --> 03:30:31.260]  I'll take brain force in the morning right before I go to my computer, and I'm good for
[03:30:31.260 --> 03:30:34.140]  the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[03:30:34.140 --> 03:30:39.860]  So it really is true that brain force is something I use every day, and it helps me with my writing.
[03:30:39.860 --> 03:30:40.860]  All right.
[03:30:40.860 --> 03:30:41.860]  We love you.
[03:30:41.860 --> 03:30:42.860]  We'll be right back.

[03:30:56.220 --> 03:31:01.580]  A lot of people have asked me, why is Infowarsstore and Infowarslife not at a probiotic for more
[03:31:01.580 --> 03:31:02.580]  than three years?
[03:31:02.580 --> 03:31:03.820]  The answer is simple.

[03:31:15.900 --> 03:31:16.900]  anymore.
[03:31:16.900 --> 03:31:22.580]  Finally, we've got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.

[03:32:55.700 --> 03:33:04.700]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:05.800 --> 03:33:20.160]  Hello everybody, we're back on InfoWars, I'm your host Chris Sky and we're going to take
[03:33:20.160 --> 03:33:29.359]  some callers, so if you want to call in, the number is 877-789-2539, give me your calls
[03:33:29.359 --> 03:33:33.359]  now and we'll take some calls, we'll take some questions, because I just talked a lot
[03:33:33.359 --> 03:33:38.640]  and I know people are going to have a lot of questions for me after that rant.
[03:33:38.640 --> 03:33:42.359]  But we have an interesting time, we're in the middle of August right now, so you're
[03:33:42.359 --> 03:33:47.199]  going to start seeing predictive programming come out in all the different types of media
[03:33:47.199 --> 03:33:50.400]  and you're going to see, they're going to start trying to push COVID measures, you're
[03:33:50.400 --> 03:33:54.599]  going to see they're going to start carrying on with the so-called climate catastrophes
[03:33:54.599 --> 03:33:59.439]  and every single thing is going to have one thing in common, it's going to try to scare
[03:33:59.439 --> 03:34:03.840]  you and it's going to try to prep you for more restrictions and more giving up of your
[03:34:03.840 --> 03:34:08.119]  rights and freedoms because that's what this game is all about.
[03:34:08.119 --> 03:34:13.240]  It is not about health and safety, this is about control, this is about governments trying
[03:34:13.240 --> 03:34:18.480]  to limit how well you're allowed to live your life and limit what you're going to be allowed
[03:34:18.480 --> 03:34:23.240]  to pass on to your children and ultimately limit the potential of generations of your
[03:34:23.240 --> 03:34:24.960]  family's well-being.
[03:34:24.960 --> 03:34:29.279]  And we have a Sherry in Wisconsin on the phone, so let's...
[03:34:29.279 --> 03:34:37.720]  ...and I were talking about this because we keep encountering this argument when we talk
[03:34:37.720 --> 03:34:43.320]  to people about, and it's awesome because of the way, you're like more patriotic as
[03:34:43.320 --> 03:34:47.880]  a Canadian to America and it's kind of weird.
[03:34:47.880 --> 03:34:53.119]  So what I want to point out is I think we have forgotten that we are a government of
[03:34:53.119 --> 03:34:55.560]  the people, by the people.
[03:34:55.560 --> 03:35:00.960]  When we send a representative out to speak for us, we need to stay in touch with that
[03:35:00.960 --> 03:35:05.240]  representative and we're not.
[03:35:05.240 --> 03:35:06.240]  It's weird.
[03:35:06.240 --> 03:35:10.880]  Well, it's because of complacency and I'll address the first part of your question is
[03:35:10.880 --> 03:35:18.199]  how why and how, it's not, to me it's not weird that I'm more accepting of the patriotism
[03:35:18.199 --> 03:35:21.960]  of Americans and I'm more excited about it because you guys are used to it.
[03:35:21.960 --> 03:35:25.240]  When you have something your whole life, you take it for granted.
[03:35:25.240 --> 03:35:29.080]  I live up in Canada where our Charter of Rights might as well be toilet paper compared to
[03:35:29.080 --> 03:35:34.199]  the Constitution and when it was put to the test, both documents were put to the test
[03:35:34.199 --> 03:35:38.840]  like never before in our lifetimes as they were in COVID, I saw that our Charter of Rights
[03:35:38.840 --> 03:35:44.439]  was literally just literally paper and over here the Constitution was holding up in court,
[03:35:44.439 --> 03:35:48.080]  the Constitution was holding up in the school system, the Constitution was holding up for
[03:35:48.080 --> 03:35:55.080]  unions and people need to understand how important that document is at limiting the
[03:35:55.080 --> 03:35:57.000]  powers of government.
[03:35:57.000 --> 03:36:01.279]  People have become so complacent over the years, just like you stated, that they elect
[03:36:01.279 --> 03:36:05.080]  these people without even knowing anything about them and once they're elected, they
[03:36:05.080 --> 03:36:10.080]  literally just let them have complete control of the ship without even asking questions,
[03:36:10.080 --> 03:36:15.640]  without any accountability and at the same time, they acknowledge that their choices
[03:36:15.640 --> 03:36:20.240]  are almost always the supposed lesser of evils.
[03:36:20.240 --> 03:36:26.480]  So they're actively empowering what they know to be evil and then acting surprised that
[03:36:26.480 --> 03:36:31.679]  evil does evil things after you've enabled them and then given them the keys to the kingdom
[03:36:31.679 --> 03:36:36.560]  without any accountability and of course, from living in any other country and looking
[03:36:36.560 --> 03:36:40.560]  in on America during COVID and seeing how we had no rights and freedoms and seeing how
[03:36:40.560 --> 03:36:46.640]  your rights and freedoms stayed strong, that's how much I can appreciate Americans' freedoms
[03:36:46.640 --> 03:36:52.000]  but at the same time, I can also see why Americans sat back and didn't see COVID as a real threat
[03:36:52.000 --> 03:36:55.080]  because their Constitution was still protecting them.
[03:36:55.080 --> 03:36:58.759]  In Canada, we didn't have the protection of the Constitution so we had no choice but to
[03:36:58.759 --> 03:37:04.080]  literally stand up physically for ourselves and it made it a lot more difficult but it
[03:37:04.080 --> 03:37:08.240]  made us a lot more passionate about it and I believe that's why our trucker convoy was
[03:37:08.240 --> 03:37:15.240]  able to get almost 10% of the entire population into the capital city that day.
[03:37:15.240 --> 03:37:20.599]  Just made my point and my sister and I were saying, I hear so many people, oh what can
[03:37:20.599 --> 03:37:21.599]  I do?
[03:37:21.599 --> 03:37:22.599]  I work all the time.
[03:37:22.599 --> 03:37:28.320]  I make it to the ballot box, oh my gosh, this starts at the local level.
[03:37:28.320 --> 03:37:33.359]  Most people in federal government started at the local level and we do not stay in touch
[03:37:33.359 --> 03:37:38.240]  with them and tell them what we think and what we want and how can they speak for us
[03:37:38.240 --> 03:37:39.960]  if we never interact with them?
[03:37:39.960 --> 03:37:41.439]  How do they know what we think?
[03:37:41.439 --> 03:37:45.560]  And I told my sister, I said, here's what we're forgetting.
[03:37:45.560 --> 03:37:52.080]  If corruption happens, money, obviously a lot of it is through money, you've got a representative
[03:37:52.080 --> 03:37:56.320]  out there, he's not hearing from his constituents, we're not talking, we're not getting out there
[03:37:56.320 --> 03:38:02.119]  on the local level and then somebody comes up with some money, oh here dude, I really
[03:38:02.119 --> 03:38:07.160]  would like this to get passed because this helps my business or me and how, I don't know,
[03:38:07.160 --> 03:38:13.840]  I don't know how tempting it would be to have tons of money thrown at you just to do a little
[03:38:13.840 --> 03:38:14.840]  favor.
[03:38:14.840 --> 03:38:18.439]  I don't know how to handle a temptation like that, I've never been encountered by it.
[03:38:18.439 --> 03:38:22.599]  We don't know what they may be coming up against but if we are not talking to them because
[03:38:22.599 --> 03:38:28.880]  we, the people, are the government, how can they do their job effectively?
[03:38:28.920 --> 03:38:32.720]  I agree 100% and like you said, it all has to happen at the local level because it's
[03:38:32.720 --> 03:38:36.480]  not like you're going to be able to pull the levers of the federal government but you can
[03:38:36.480 --> 03:38:41.800]  on individual counties and individual towns and even smaller cities quite easily if people
[03:38:41.800 --> 03:38:45.279]  are organized and people are loud and people are perseverant.
[03:38:45.279 --> 03:38:47.279]  We've got to fight harder.
[03:38:47.279 --> 03:38:52.439]  We may all have jobs, we may all have lives, we may be busy, we may even be overwhelmed
[03:38:52.439 --> 03:38:56.920]  but we have got to look at this seriously and we have got to figure out how to pull ourselves
[03:38:56.920 --> 03:39:00.960]  up by our bootstraps and get back to the government that our founding fathers put
[03:39:00.960 --> 03:39:01.960]  together.
[03:39:01.960 --> 03:39:05.560]  I agree and once you hold them accountable here, you can provide an example for the rest
[03:39:05.560 --> 03:39:09.480]  of the world and that's one of the reasons, probably the main reason, why I started the
[03:39:09.480 --> 03:39:13.160]  world tour to change the world in the land of the free, the United States.
[03:39:13.160 --> 03:39:16.279]  Thank you so much.
[03:39:16.279 --> 03:39:17.880]  Kyle in Texas.
[03:39:17.880 --> 03:39:25.759]  Hey Chris Sky, welcome to Texas, I'm calling from West Texas, been following you, I was
[03:39:25.759 --> 03:39:29.840]  going to request if you would stop in Lubbock on your way out to New Mexico, it's probably
[03:39:29.840 --> 03:39:34.800]  our only big city in West Texas and we've got a lot of patriots out here.
[03:39:34.800 --> 03:39:40.480]  The reason people live in West Texas is because it's considered no man's land which means
[03:39:40.480 --> 03:39:45.000]  it's not easy to live out here so all the people out here have a small town vibe but
[03:39:45.000 --> 03:39:51.519]  it's a pretty big town and everyone's pretty tough minded out here so if you can make it
[03:39:51.519 --> 03:39:59.320]  out here and rally the troops, we can get together and work on that, I know we need
[03:39:59.320 --> 03:40:00.320]  a big push.
[03:40:00.320 --> 03:40:03.679]  Well thanks for reminding me because I wanted to give everybody a point of contact for me,
[03:40:03.679 --> 03:40:07.960]  that's why I'm doing shows like this because I had all this not planned because I was not
[03:40:07.960 --> 03:40:12.039]  sure that I was even going to be able to get into the country so within hours I was already
[03:40:12.039 --> 03:40:17.279]  booked in multiple states and I did that because I give out my personal number and that's
[03:40:17.279 --> 03:40:20.119]  how I connect with people, they know they can contact me directly and I'm going to give
[03:40:20.119 --> 03:40:28.000]  it out right now and there it is actually, it's 416-400-9994, I'm always looking for
[03:40:28.000 --> 03:40:31.759]  people to contact me in different states if they want me on a show, if they want to do
[03:40:31.759 --> 03:40:35.119]  a meet and greet, if they just want to do a private thing, we're looking for sponsors,
[03:40:35.119 --> 03:40:39.880]  we're looking for support in any way possible and for anybody who sees this that has a show
[03:40:39.880 --> 03:40:44.119]  in the states and wants me on it, where's Joe Rogan, where's Tucker Carlson, where's
[03:40:44.119 --> 03:40:47.800]  Del Bigtree, where's even Andrew Tate, why isn't he helping?
[03:40:47.800 --> 03:40:51.119]  If I had the money of Andrew Tate, this problem would already have been solved so I got to
[03:40:51.119 --> 03:40:54.880]  call out these big name people because they have the platform, they have the resources,
[03:40:54.880 --> 03:41:01.920]  they have the connections that if we did work together and we did proliferate these ideas
[03:41:01.920 --> 03:41:07.960]  on those platforms, we could reach every continent of the globe literally overnight and we can
[03:41:07.960 --> 03:41:13.599]  spark a global revolution of thought in the vast majority of people.
[03:41:13.599 --> 03:41:18.840]  We've reached millions of people, we need to reach billions of people and when billions
[03:41:18.840 --> 03:41:24.960]  of people are thinking like us, when billions of people have the courage to stand up for
[03:41:24.960 --> 03:41:29.560]  what they know is right and when billions of people have the foresight to see what will
[03:41:29.560 --> 03:41:35.000]  happen if they don't and they have the foresight to see what will happen if they do, I am quite
[03:41:35.000 --> 03:41:42.039]  confident that we will see a joining of the minds and resources all around the world like
[03:41:42.039 --> 03:41:46.840]  something we've never witnessed before or I wouldn't be wasting my time doing what I'm
[03:41:46.840 --> 03:41:48.800]  doing right now.
[03:41:48.800 --> 03:41:52.960]  Am I still on?
[03:41:52.960 --> 03:41:53.960]  Thanks Kyle.
[03:41:53.960 --> 03:41:55.480]  Send me a text and see if I can get down there.
[03:41:55.480 --> 03:41:57.720]  We'll go to Steve in Florida.
[03:41:57.720 --> 03:42:03.800]  Hey Chris, it's a real pleasure to talk to you.
[03:42:03.800 --> 03:42:08.880]  We only got 45 seconds for the commercial so please make it quick and I'll address it
[03:42:08.880 --> 03:42:10.439]  when we come back.
[03:42:10.840 --> 03:42:11.840]  Alright.
[03:42:11.840 --> 03:42:16.840]  My main point is that you do a lot of good predictions and the more I analyze it, the
[03:42:16.840 --> 03:42:19.759]  more I research it, I'm kind of seeing the CBDC push.
[03:42:19.759 --> 03:42:25.359]  I think, in my opinion, it's going to happen after like a climate emergency or crisis through
[03:42:25.359 --> 03:42:27.720]  the executive order is going to be declared.
[03:42:27.720 --> 03:42:28.720]  What's your take on that?
[03:42:28.720 --> 03:42:32.920]  Well, I'm going to talk about that as soon as we come back because I think that's probably,
[03:42:32.920 --> 03:42:36.279]  the CBDC is probably their final nail in the coffin.
[03:42:36.279 --> 03:42:40.320]  I think it's the linchpin for the global tyranny and I'm going to tell you exactly why when
[03:42:40.320 --> 03:42:44.840]  we come back and I'm going to tell you exactly why we need to stop it on a national level
[03:42:44.840 --> 03:42:46.320]  and an international level.
[03:42:46.320 --> 03:42:52.320]  So stick with me and we'll be back in a couple of minutes.
[03:42:52.320 --> 03:42:57.039]  Thank you everybody.
[03:42:57.039 --> 03:43:01.599]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through mother nature has given us the
[03:43:01.599 --> 03:43:02.599]  answer.
[03:43:02.599 --> 03:43:06.679]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum CBD oil, the incredible things it
[03:43:06.679 --> 03:43:12.320]  does for your nerves, your brain, your entire physiological system, for your nervous system
[03:43:12.320 --> 03:43:13.320]  particularly.
[03:43:13.320 --> 03:43:15.320]  Everybody knows it's incredible, it works.
[03:43:15.320 --> 03:43:20.119]  We have the strongest, best CBD oil you're going to find anywhere at the lowest price.
[03:43:20.119 --> 03:43:26.920]  Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for 30% more because that's who we're getting it from,
[03:43:26.920 --> 03:43:29.640]  made right here in Central Texas.
[03:43:29.640 --> 03:43:33.279]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[03:43:33.279 --> 03:43:38.880]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.
[03:43:38.880 --> 03:43:41.960]  It's based right here in Texas and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[03:43:41.960 --> 03:43:45.560]  And here's what's even crazier, 30% off of what they're selling it for.
[03:43:45.560 --> 03:43:48.759]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[03:43:48.759 --> 03:43:53.119]  So this is the highest rated, already at the lowest price, now even a lower price.
[03:43:53.119 --> 03:43:56.480]  Rebel Zen, get yours at InfoWarsStore.com now.
[03:43:56.480 --> 03:43:58.359]  Hey everybody, Rodney Outbrine here.

[03:46:06.519 --> 03:46:11.679]  They are both clones of national bestselling products from a major pharmaceutical slash
[03:46:11.679 --> 03:46:16.179]  supplement maker that are Lister's and Patriot's that are allowing us to private label it
[03:46:16.179 --> 03:46:18.880]  at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[03:46:18.880 --> 03:46:23.000]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[03:46:23.000 --> 03:46:29.119]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and to also make your
[03:46:29.119 --> 03:46:34.279]  nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more
[03:46:34.279 --> 03:46:35.920]  inductive to pain.
[03:46:35.920 --> 03:46:38.199]  There's major research behind this all.
[03:46:38.199 --> 03:46:45.320]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from InfoWarsMD and Nerve Renew from InfoWarsMD exclusively
[03:46:45.320 --> 03:46:48.400]  at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[03:46:48.400 --> 03:46:53.560]  Introducing them both, 25% off, you'll find them exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com and
[03:46:53.560 --> 03:46:58.199]  they fund our operation.
[03:46:58.199 --> 03:47:04.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:05.800 --> 03:47:17.160]  Hello everybody, welcome back, this is the last segment on the Alex Jones show and right
[03:47:17.160 --> 03:47:21.599]  before we got off we were with Stephen in Florida and he was asking me about central
[03:47:21.599 --> 03:47:24.920]  bank digital currency and what I believe that to be.
[03:47:24.920 --> 03:47:30.880]  I think that is the linchpin of the globalist plan, I believe they won't need any more pandemics
[03:47:30.880 --> 03:47:34.359]  after that, they won't need any more climate change edicts after that.
[03:47:34.359 --> 03:47:41.279]  If they can get everybody onto a digital ID and a digital currency, they have 100% control
[03:47:41.279 --> 03:47:47.000]  over every man, woman and child on this planet and once they have that control, once they
[03:47:47.000 --> 03:47:52.160]  can choose when and where and what you can spend your money on, they're going to use
[03:47:52.160 --> 03:47:58.439]  the most sinister thing they've thought of yet and they're literally drooling at the
[03:47:58.439 --> 03:48:05.400]  idea to be able to implement this upon you and this will be the nail in the coffin for
[03:48:05.400 --> 03:48:12.279]  society for generations to come until society rises up in a violent revolution to dispel
[03:48:12.279 --> 03:48:16.679]  these people from power if they allow this to happen and what am I talking about?
[03:48:16.679 --> 03:48:25.080]  I'm talking about the ability to make your, and I use that term lightly, your money expire.
[03:48:25.080 --> 03:48:29.560]  They want you on a digital currency that they not only can control where and when you
[03:48:29.560 --> 03:48:35.519]  can spend your money, they want to put an expiry date on your money so if you do not spend
[03:48:35.519 --> 03:48:41.160]  your money by that certain time, they will recuperate it under the auspice that you are
[03:48:41.160 --> 03:48:46.560]  hoarding more than you need, all part of the climate change agenda of course.
[03:48:46.560 --> 03:48:52.800]  Now this obviously is not a good thing but if you look at it in a deeper way and analyze
[03:48:52.800 --> 03:48:58.560]  what it truly means, it is the most horrifying aspect and the final nail in the coffin of
[03:48:58.560 --> 03:49:03.039]  every one of their COVID and climate change agendas wrapped up into one.
[03:49:03.039 --> 03:49:10.279]  Because if your money expires, no matter how smart you are, no matter how much you work,
[03:49:10.279 --> 03:49:15.560]  no matter how successful your business, no matter how many different businesses you own,
[03:49:15.560 --> 03:49:22.580]  no matter what you do, they will have complete control over your social status.
[03:49:22.580 --> 03:49:26.119]  You will not be able to improve your financial situation.
[03:49:26.119 --> 03:49:30.580]  You will not be able to pass on anything of worth to your family.
[03:49:30.580 --> 03:49:38.939]  They have now locked you in a state of perpetual servitude where they are the rulers, you are
[03:49:38.939 --> 03:49:41.900]  the slaves, and they don't even have to manage you.
[03:49:41.900 --> 03:49:44.539]  It's all managed for them.
[03:49:44.539 --> 03:49:46.420]  It all happens automatically.
[03:49:46.420 --> 03:49:48.019]  It all happens digitally.
[03:49:48.019 --> 03:49:52.420]  They can be chilling on their yachts every single day while you're stuck in your 15 minute
[03:49:52.460 --> 03:49:58.019]  city, 250 square foot condo, going downstairs to work, going upstairs for your coffee, going
[03:49:58.019 --> 03:50:02.699]  upstairs for your gym, going to the grocery store, and spending 90% of your so-called
[03:50:02.699 --> 03:50:09.220]  life inside the same building so you can control your so-called carbon footprint and do your
[03:50:09.220 --> 03:50:15.500]  part to eliminate the carbon, which in reality is eliminating life on planet Earth.
[03:50:15.500 --> 03:50:17.599]  They want to eliminate life.
[03:50:17.599 --> 03:50:23.640]  They want to eliminate where you can go, what you can do, what you can eat, the experiences
[03:50:23.640 --> 03:50:27.080]  you and your family and children would have otherwise had.
[03:50:27.080 --> 03:50:28.080]  Let's go to another call.
[03:50:28.080 --> 03:50:30.880]  We're going to go to Tom in Canada, my home country.
[03:50:30.880 --> 03:50:31.880]  Hey, Chris.
[03:50:31.880 --> 03:50:32.880]  Tom in Toronto.
[03:50:32.880 --> 03:50:33.880]  How are you, buddy?
[03:50:33.880 --> 03:50:34.880]  Very proud you're representing us down there.
[03:50:34.880 --> 03:50:35.880]  Thank you.
[03:50:35.880 --> 03:50:46.279]  I wanted to ask about the accountability piece because at the City of Toronto, when we look
[03:50:46.279 --> 03:50:51.359]  at the vaccine mandate and all the harms that were caused, we had the mayor's now
[03:50:51.359 --> 03:50:58.880]  gone, Mayor Tory's gone, Chris Murray, the city manager, he left, Tracy Cook, the deputy
[03:50:58.880 --> 03:50:59.880]  city manager left.
[03:50:59.880 --> 03:51:03.480]  They all left, like all these rats jumping off the ship.
[03:51:03.480 --> 03:51:07.119]  How do we get that accountability?
[03:51:07.119 --> 03:51:12.759]  I am so angry about what they put us through and I don't think people south of the border
[03:51:12.759 --> 03:51:16.759]  can appreciate what we went through in Canada.
[03:51:16.759 --> 03:51:21.439]  I just would like to get your thoughts, I guess, on how do we get some accountability
[03:51:21.439 --> 03:51:26.720]  from the trios of the world because they seem to rig the game so that they never have to
[03:51:26.720 --> 03:51:27.720]  face the music.
[03:51:27.720 --> 03:51:31.000]  Well, that is the trillion dollar question and that is what we've still been trying to
[03:51:31.000 --> 03:51:34.439]  figure out over the last three years because we've been taking action, which was phase
[03:51:34.439 --> 03:51:35.439]  two, in every way possible.
[03:51:35.439 --> 03:51:36.439]  We've been speaking out.
[03:51:36.439 --> 03:51:37.439]  We've been doing lawsuits.
[03:51:37.439 --> 03:51:38.439]  We made movies.
[03:51:38.439 --> 03:51:39.439]  We did songs.
[03:51:39.439 --> 03:51:40.439]  We did rallies.
[03:51:40.439 --> 03:51:45.359]  We did everything you could possibly think of to expose these people and to wake people
[03:51:45.359 --> 03:51:46.359]  up.
[03:51:46.359 --> 03:51:49.759]  And now it got to the point, like you said, that they're feeling the heat so they're actually
[03:51:49.759 --> 03:51:50.759]  resigning.
[03:51:50.759 --> 03:51:51.759]  They're jumping ship.
[03:51:51.759 --> 03:51:55.400]  Trudeau had to literally fire about 80% of his cabinet, but what did he do?
[03:51:55.400 --> 03:51:57.119]  He just gave them all new jobs.
[03:51:57.119 --> 03:52:00.519]  So it's like they're just shuffling the deck, shuffling the chairs, giving people a clean
[03:52:00.519 --> 03:52:03.039]  slate so they can commit more crimes against humanity.
[03:52:03.039 --> 03:52:07.439]  And I believe the only thing that's going to be able to stop them is what I'm doing now,
[03:52:07.439 --> 03:52:12.279]  and to travel around the world, specifically to the Commonwealth countries right now, and
[03:52:12.279 --> 03:52:17.800]  trying to unite us with a global voice that freedom is essential, that government needs
[03:52:17.800 --> 03:52:25.439]  to be limited in size and scope, and that mandates have no place in any free society.
[03:52:25.439 --> 03:52:29.840]  And when we can get, like I said, when we get billions of people thinking like us, acting
[03:52:29.840 --> 03:52:35.160]  like us, and having the courage to stand up for themselves, we will change the world.
[03:52:35.160 --> 03:52:38.480]  And that is why this is called the Change the World Tour, because that's exactly what
[03:52:38.480 --> 03:52:40.480]  I intend on doing.
[03:52:40.480 --> 03:52:46.000]  Well, I hope to see you when you come back to the GTA.
[03:52:46.000 --> 03:52:47.000]  Thank you.
[03:52:47.000 --> 03:52:50.359]  I'll be back soon enough, but I have a lot of work to do first.
[03:52:50.359 --> 03:52:53.480]  Let's go to Black Rant in South Carolina.
[03:52:53.480 --> 03:52:58.039]  Hello, Mr. Scottie, how are you doing today?
[03:52:58.039 --> 03:52:59.039]  I'm fantastic.
[03:52:59.039 --> 03:53:00.359]  I couldn't be any better.
[03:53:00.359 --> 03:53:03.519]  I'm so happy to be in the United States, I'm not going to lie.
[03:53:03.519 --> 03:53:07.039]  I'm happy that you're here as well, that was quite a story.
[03:53:07.039 --> 03:53:11.480]  I wanted to illuminate something that I think might be slipping through the cracks for a
[03:53:11.480 --> 03:53:13.920]  lot of conservatives right now.
[03:53:13.920 --> 03:53:20.439]  And I understand we have, you know, big fish to fry, CBDCs, next pandemic, all that stuff.
[03:53:20.439 --> 03:53:25.720]  But I feel like the main thing that will be the number one map for those things, implementing
[03:53:25.720 --> 03:53:32.439]  CBDCs, is going to be the coming racial divide, the race riots that are going to happen next
[03:53:32.439 --> 03:53:34.080]  year is our presidential election year.
[03:53:34.080 --> 03:53:36.359]  So we know it's going to be insane.
[03:53:36.359 --> 03:53:41.279]  I want to highlight something for everybody that's just gone viral over the past few days.
[03:53:41.279 --> 03:53:48.039]  If you want to Google Alabama Riverboat Brawl, oh my goodness, right.
[03:53:48.039 --> 03:53:54.840]  The Alabama Riverboat Brawl, when I looked at it, nothing about it seemed racially motivated
[03:53:54.840 --> 03:53:55.840]  at all.
[03:53:55.840 --> 03:54:01.439]  But all the memes, all the commentary, all the videos, pictures, all the comments in
[03:54:01.439 --> 03:54:07.519]  every comment section, it seems to have developed a narrative that this was somehow vengeance
[03:54:07.519 --> 03:54:12.119]  for black people for all the ills that every white person has ever done ever throughout
[03:54:12.119 --> 03:54:13.119]  all of history.
[03:54:13.119 --> 03:54:18.880]  When in reality, it's just a couple of drunk idiots that decided to get into a conflict
[03:54:18.880 --> 03:54:20.960]  with somebody and then everybody jumped in.
[03:54:20.960 --> 03:54:24.840]  If you look at all the different angles of the video, you see black and white people
[03:54:24.840 --> 03:54:28.279]  standing on the side together watching the brawl.
[03:54:28.279 --> 03:54:33.599]  But I use this as a point of reference to show that if this is something that can be
[03:54:33.599 --> 03:54:40.080]  done, some simple incident between a few people acting ridiculously, and then the narrative
[03:54:40.080 --> 03:54:45.439]  that is drawn from that is somehow racial, where people feel like, well, if we can just
[03:54:45.439 --> 03:54:50.279]  come together and act as a gang, we'll have success.
[03:54:50.279 --> 03:54:55.080]  That to me seems like the biggest narrative that will be brought out next year, which
[03:54:55.080 --> 03:54:59.519]  is also another way to probably bring out Michelle Obama, whatever, what have you.
[03:54:59.519 --> 03:55:05.279]  But I feel like we were going to have some extreme race riots in the Western world, primarily
[03:55:05.279 --> 03:55:11.920]  in America, along with food shortages and the economy kind of taking a hit.
[03:55:11.920 --> 03:55:15.920]  It's not going to be hard to trigger these things in the coming year.
[03:55:15.920 --> 03:55:16.920]  Your thoughts?
[03:55:16.920 --> 03:55:21.800]  My thoughts are you're 100% right, because with everything they're trying to do to us,
[03:55:21.800 --> 03:55:25.920]  their number one weapon is fear, and their number one weapon to stop us from fighting
[03:55:25.920 --> 03:55:31.560]  back besides making us so scared that we're paralyzed to move is division.
[03:55:31.560 --> 03:55:34.160]  And in the United States, they love racial division.
[03:55:34.160 --> 03:55:36.800]  In Canada, it's kind of hard for them to do the racial division.
[03:55:36.800 --> 03:55:38.359]  It doesn't really work very well.
[03:55:38.359 --> 03:55:40.000]  But they divide us with religion.
[03:55:40.000 --> 03:55:41.800]  They divide us with social status.
[03:55:41.800 --> 03:55:45.720]  They divide us with who's essential and non-essential, who's wearing a mask, who's not wearing a
[03:55:45.720 --> 03:55:48.160]  mask, who's jabbed, who's not jabbed.
[03:55:48.160 --> 03:55:54.199]  Every single point of division they can create, they will use, because it divides your army
[03:55:54.199 --> 03:55:56.359]  smaller and smaller and smaller.
[03:55:56.359 --> 03:55:57.359]  It divides your voice.
[03:55:57.359 --> 03:55:59.359]  It divides your power.
[03:55:59.359 --> 03:56:00.800]  It nullifies you.
[03:56:00.800 --> 03:56:04.000]  And that's the most important message I want to leave here with in the past minute and
[03:56:04.000 --> 03:56:05.160]  30 seconds.
[03:56:05.160 --> 03:56:09.679]  They are going to try to do everything they can to put you in a negative state of mind.
[03:56:09.679 --> 03:56:14.519]  Because even if I'm around in every country around the world, if I don't non-stop and
[03:56:14.519 --> 03:56:19.480]  went to all 197 countries, whatever it is, and we woke up every single person on planet
[03:56:19.480 --> 03:56:20.480]  Earth.
[03:56:20.480 --> 03:56:26.759]  The moment you're feeling despair, hopelessness, hate, or any other negative emotion, you are
[03:56:26.759 --> 03:56:29.279]  now nullified as a freedom fighter.
[03:56:29.279 --> 03:56:32.599]  You're not going to act in your best interest or the best interest of the country.
[03:56:32.599 --> 03:56:37.000]  And you're going to be unable to connect with other positive people that are acting.
[03:56:37.000 --> 03:56:41.640]  So these points of division, these stupid narratives based on these memes, they are
[03:56:41.640 --> 03:56:47.160]  all designed to try to turn people against each other and ultimately to put people in
[03:56:47.160 --> 03:56:50.599]  a negative state of mind, because then it takes you out of the equation.
[03:56:50.599 --> 03:56:56.800]  You become completely irrelevant in the fight for humanity's freedom unless you truly believe
[03:56:56.800 --> 03:57:00.119]  in freedom and you truly want to do the right thing.
[03:57:00.119 --> 03:57:05.519]  I believe the only reason I've made it this far and the only reason I even got into the
[03:57:05.519 --> 03:57:10.800]  United States is because those brave men and women looked at me and they could see that
[03:57:10.960 --> 03:57:13.560]  my intentions were genuine.
[03:57:13.560 --> 03:57:19.840]  And I'm here because I believe with 100% conviction that I am doing the right thing, not only
[03:57:19.840 --> 03:57:23.920]  for myself and my family, but for the rest of humanity.
[03:57:23.920 --> 03:57:28.920]  And if you can go to sleep at night and wake up with that feeling that you know you're
[03:57:28.920 --> 03:57:31.480]  doing the right thing, well, you are.
[03:57:31.480 --> 03:57:35.000]  And you just have to keep doing that every single day.
[03:57:35.000 --> 03:57:39.039]  And when we wake up the world and when we teach them how to fight back, there's only
[03:57:39.039 --> 03:57:40.840]  one inevitable result.
[03:57:40.840 --> 03:57:43.000]  We win, they lose.
[03:57:43.000 --> 03:57:44.000]  God bless you.
[03:57:44.000 --> 03:57:45.000]  God bless America.
[03:57:45.000 --> 03:57:46.000]  Goodbye, everybody.
[03:57:46.000 --> 03:57:52.199]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down, this is the most concentrated,
[03:57:52.199 --> 03:57:55.039]  high quality bone broth there is.
[03:57:55.039 --> 03:58:00.240]  Concentrated chicken broth, patented amazing, then a huge dose of chaga mushroom, a massive
[03:58:00.240 --> 03:58:06.160]  dose of beet pollen, a gigantic dose of highest quality turmeric, and then it just gets crazier
[03:58:06.160 --> 03:58:07.320]  from there.
[03:58:07.320 --> 03:58:08.480]  It's about to sell out.
[03:58:08.480 --> 03:58:10.000]  We haven't had it in stock for years.
