[01:31.320 --> 01:34.080]  last 30 minutes of the show of course there's big blocks in there where we
[01:34.080 --> 01:37.800]  don't have guests today we're gonna be covering all of the amazingly important
[01:37.800 --> 01:43.640]  news like the SEC securities and change commission mold national security status
[01:43.640 --> 01:50.240]  for AIG details to use national security to keep it secret in fact they
[01:50.240 --> 01:54.320]  attempted that but it was decided that it would just be too transparently
[01:54.320 --> 01:59.440]  corrupt and so they just illegally made its secret and ordered the banks and
[01:59.440 --> 02:03.320]  brokerage firms not to tell the public or Congress or anybody else who got the
[02:03.320 --> 02:11.600]  money like little Timmy Geithner little Timmy Geithner got the money Henry
[02:11.600 --> 02:18.160]  Paulson got the money the very people who were giving the money to the banks
[02:18.160 --> 02:24.320]  that then gave it to themselves so that is coming up also we have CNN reporting
[02:24.320 --> 02:29.320]  what we told you a month ago and we're gonna line him back up for the show
[02:29.320 --> 02:36.640]  Kurt Haskell we have CNN reporting and I'm looking around here for my article
[02:36.640 --> 02:41.480]  there's just so much of it that there was a second man on the flight and they
[02:41.480 --> 02:45.400]  did arrest him and they've been very secretive about it so they denied that
[02:45.400 --> 02:50.080]  and gave out six different stories and then I quit counting and then now they
[02:50.080 --> 02:53.920]  admit that that okay indeed they were tracking somebody they did let him on
[02:53.920 --> 02:57.160]  the plane and they did detain him and they did tell the people that there was
[02:57.160 --> 03:02.120]  a bomb once they were in the customs office in Detroit coming in on that
[03:02.120 --> 03:08.600]  Christmas Day underwear botched bombing attack so Kurt Haskell who was called a
[03:08.600 --> 03:13.040]  liar by the media and the government he's now been proven absolutely right
[03:13.040 --> 03:18.000]  and correct along with his wife and other witnesses that backed him up so that
[03:18.000 --> 03:22.760]  happened just amazing how much the mainstream media lies and then later is
[03:22.760 --> 03:27.440]  forced to tell the truth it's just more often than not it's a lie by design and
[03:27.440 --> 03:31.040]  that's why it's so scary to know the mainstream media still has so many
[03:31.040 --> 03:38.720]  people bamboozled and hoodwinked who were out there so we're gonna be going
[03:38.720 --> 03:42.640]  over that today and this came out last Friday and I covered it on coast to coast
[03:42.640 --> 03:48.560]  a.m. and then never covered it Monday dropped the ball big time but we're gonna
[03:48.560 --> 03:56.040]  pick it back up right now fumbled the ball like the Minnesota Vikings did over
[03:56.040 --> 04:03.040]  and over again oh they're a football analogy or parallel tax and spend UN's
[04:03.040 --> 04:09.360]  RX for New World Medical Order and they call for taxes on phones on health care
[04:09.360 --> 04:17.760]  on GDP literally they list more than 10 of them here and we have the internal UN
[04:17.760 --> 04:23.480]  executive summary report of the World Health Organization of the UN and the UN
[04:23.480 --> 04:29.320]  is denying that this is even theirs when separately everything and more that is in
[04:29.320 --> 04:37.720]  this secret report was publicly in the Copenhagen greenhouse gas tax treaty so
[04:37.720 --> 04:42.160]  I mean we have them with their pants down again here so we're gonna be going
[04:42.160 --> 04:47.680]  over that as well I want to salute everybody I was like 80 plus percent
[04:47.680 --> 04:51.560]  of the people there were in infowars.com or Obama Joker shirts want to salute all

[08:54.960 --> 09:01.840]  entire amazing bio on his website but most people that watch any financial
[09:01.840 --> 09:08.520]  television bloomberg CNBC seeing in any of it he mr. faber is a no no no no
[09:08.520 --> 09:12.160]  stranger to you but let's get right into the interview joining us from switzerland
[09:12.160 --> 09:16.360]  dr. faber thanks for coming on it's my pleasure thank you very much for having
[09:16.360 --> 09:22.000]  me it's good to have you here okay so much is going on what's really happening
[09:22.000 --> 09:25.560]  in the world economy what's really happening with sovereign debt private
[09:25.560 --> 09:29.720]  debt the dollar dollar devaluation give us your fork well break down what's
[09:29.720 --> 09:34.640]  currently happening and and your forecast place well basically what we
[09:34.640 --> 09:45.280]  have is excessive credit growth that led in the period 2001 to 2008 to the
[09:45.280 --> 09:52.560]  housing bubble and then the collapse of the housing bubble and then we had the
[09:52.560 --> 10:00.760]  recession in 2008 2009 and the recession was cushioned through huge
[10:00.760 --> 10:06.680]  government stimulus and monetizing in other words the government through the
[10:06.680 --> 10:11.600]  federal reserve is buying government debt and is expanding its balance sheet
[10:11.600 --> 10:18.480]  and I think that this will not help the economy very much but what it's helped
[10:18.480 --> 10:26.960]  is essentially emerging economies because don't forget after 1998 because of the
[10:26.960 --> 10:32.800]  credit bubble and the housing bubble what the US did was to over consume and
[10:32.800 --> 10:37.120]  this overconsumption in other words consumption went up as a percent of the
[10:37.120 --> 10:43.600]  economy led to the trade deficit and the trade deficit was then offset by trade
[10:43.600 --> 10:49.360]  services in emerging economies in particular in China and that drove
[10:49.360 --> 10:56.160]  industrial production employment and capital spending in China and along with
[10:56.160 --> 11:02.680]  that also commodity prices higher so actually the monetary policies of the
[11:02.680 --> 11:08.800]  US under mr. Greenspan and mr. Bernanke have been a complete disaster for the
[11:08.800 --> 11:14.800]  United States but complete but it has helped the rest of the world the rest
[11:14.800 --> 11:19.760]  of the world the emerging economies and the producers of oil and copper and
[11:19.760 --> 11:26.200]  iron ore should all send a thank-you note to mr. Ben Bernanke and mr. Greenspan
[11:26.200 --> 11:31.840]  that they flooded the world with liquidity and as a result of that that
[11:31.840 --> 11:40.680]  emerging economies in particular the resource producers benefited now when
[11:40.680 --> 11:43.760]  we look at what's happening with the economy they've been telling us in the
[11:43.760 --> 11:48.960]  last year that we've had a recovery that unemployment's only 10.2 but most of the
[11:48.960 --> 11:54.320]  big private institutions that that they use the old numbers crunching system
[11:54.320 --> 11:58.280]  that the government previously used that most statisticians and economists
[11:58.280 --> 12:05.400]  believe is is much more accurate they say it's over 22% right now and that
[12:05.400 --> 12:11.400]  we're just going to continue sliding in to a deepening really depression for
[12:11.400 --> 12:15.080]  Main Street the big banks and brokerage firms are all having record profits off
[12:15.080 --> 12:19.600]  all the money they've stolen through the bailouts can you speak to what you
[12:19.600 --> 12:24.320]  think the economy is going to look like in the health of the dollar and and what
[12:24.320 --> 12:31.680]  you see unfolding well I mean given the huge stimulus we had and also given that
[12:31.680 --> 12:40.400]  the economy collapsed between September 2008 and March 2009 the figures
[12:40.400 --> 12:44.480]  economically speaking will look somewhat better in the next three months
[12:44.480 --> 12:51.920]  because these months January February March 2009 were very bad so I mean maybe
[12:51.920 --> 12:56.960]  the economy shows signs of bottoming out and some improvement will take place
[12:56.960 --> 13:06.560]  even but in general I think that the outlook for future growth is very poor
[13:06.560 --> 13:16.400]  in other words the large deficits lead to larger government debt that keeps
[13:16.400 --> 13:20.880]  interest rates on long-dated securities in other words on long-term bonds
[13:20.880 --> 13:27.840]  relatively high and to may even lead to inflation at some point I mean my sense
[13:27.840 --> 13:34.360]  is that in the last 20 years actually the typical household in the US the
[13:34.360 --> 13:40.320]  median household as they call it has not made any progress but who's made
[13:40.320 --> 13:46.000]  progress are of course as you said said the thieves on Wall Street they have made
[13:46.000 --> 13:54.520]  a lot of progress and government employees well that's the issue is that
[13:54.520 --> 13:59.360]  government is exploding in size Obama spent more money in one year than all
[13:59.360 --> 14:03.760]  presidents before him combined they're just hiring more police more bureaucrats
[14:03.760 --> 14:07.120]  that's the only sector that's growing and they're now saying they're going to
[14:07.120 --> 14:11.000]  continue the spending and that they're going to raise taxes and they are raising
[14:11.000 --> 14:17.240]  taxes at every level state federal local international and that we see many UN
[14:17.240 --> 14:20.760]  chiefs and others saying look we want to end the industrialized world they
[14:20.760 --> 14:24.760]  government says we're consuming too much so they're doing us a favor clamping
[14:24.760 --> 14:30.320]  down on the economy and this is actually being done by design many experts
[14:30.320 --> 14:36.760]  believe what's your take on that well basically I think that means Obama is
[14:36.760 --> 14:42.640]  right to hire a lot of policemen because if I were such a bad president I would
[14:42.640 --> 14:50.920]  also need increasing protection but in general I think that his administration
[14:50.920 --> 14:58.120]  is a complete failure in terms of economic and foreign policies nothing
[14:58.120 --> 15:04.160]  has been addressed overseas he has increased the engaged engagement in
[15:04.160 --> 15:11.480]  Afghanistan and I can assure you that Afghanistan is a country where nobody
[15:11.480 --> 15:17.360]  has an interest that the US will win conflict neither the Chinese nor the
[15:17.360 --> 15:22.360]  Indians nor the Pakistanis nor the Russians nor the mercenaries who are
[15:22.360 --> 15:28.960]  hired in Pakistan so it will never end and it will be a bottomless pit and in
[15:28.960 --> 15:34.280]  terms of domestic policies the health care reform is another disaster because
[15:34.280 --> 15:39.640]  it creates uncertainty so let's assume you have a business you employ 50 people
[15:39.640 --> 15:43.960]  you don't know what your tax rate will be three years from now you don't know
[15:43.960 --> 15:48.240]  what your health care bill will be three years from now about the last thing you
[15:48.240 --> 15:55.720]  will do is hire people so I think that the uncertainty he has created is very
[15:55.720 --> 16:02.840]  very bad for the economy in the long run in addition to that as you just pointed
[16:02.840 --> 16:08.120]  out he has piled up huge deficits they're running now at an annual rate of
[16:08.120 --> 16:14.960]  say one and a half trillion dollars the problem is that they will not go down I
[16:14.960 --> 16:20.080]  think they will actually increase and so the government's debt increases and one
[16:20.080 --> 16:25.600]  day this increased government debt will lead to substantially higher interest
[16:25.600 --> 16:31.160]  rates well Venezuela as you know last week the value of their currency by 50
[16:31.160 --> 16:36.880]  percent we have experienced a long slide in the value of a dollar evidenced by a
[16:36.880 --> 16:45.880]  candy bar 20 years ago being a quarter and now it's a dollar or a beer being a
[16:45.880 --> 16:51.600]  quarter and now it's a dollar 50 or $2 I mean obviously people know there's real
[16:51.600 --> 16:57.400]  inflation but towards the end of a devaluation it tends to accelerate we're
[16:57.400 --> 17:01.440]  certainly seeing that right now you know there's temporary as people do the
[17:01.440 --> 17:06.480]  reverse carry trade for those that don't know back into the United States we
[17:06.480 --> 17:09.880]  saw a buoying for a time as dr. Paul Craig Roberts and other economists
[17:09.880 --> 17:14.040]  predicted on the show in the fall of last year but they say overall it is a
[17:14.040 --> 17:18.600]  downward-sliding slow death of the dollar and that the global interest have
[17:18.600 --> 17:21.920]  decided to go ahead and abandon the dollar the only question is how to
[17:21.920 --> 17:29.000]  abandon it what's your take on that dr. Faber well basically there isn't really
[17:29.000 --> 17:34.720]  an international currency at the present to replace the dollar and also
[17:34.720 --> 17:43.680]  whereas I'm very critical of US monetary and fiscal policies I'm also critical of
[17:43.680 --> 17:48.000]  other countries fiscal and monetary policies because other countries are
[17:48.000 --> 17:53.120]  also very good at printing money so I think the issue here is that all
[17:53.120 --> 18:00.200]  currencies lose their purchasing power over time I mean you just mentioned that
[18:00.200 --> 18:05.480]  the candy bar used to cost 25 cents and now it's a dollar or whatever it is the
[18:05.480 --> 18:11.200]  same has happened in Switzerland and in other countries around the world but in
[18:11.200 --> 18:18.240]  this situation there is essentially one currency that keeps its purchasing power
[18:18.240 --> 18:25.240]  and these are precious metals including gold silver platinum palladium because
[18:25.240 --> 18:31.720]  you can't increase the quantity mr. Bernanke has come out openly and said if
[18:31.720 --> 18:37.640]  there was a deflationary threat and I can explain you later on why deflation
[18:37.640 --> 18:43.880]  may not necessarily be bad if there is a deflationary threat he said then we can
[18:43.880 --> 18:48.440]  drop dollar bills on to the United States from helicopter well that won't
[18:48.440 --> 18:55.000]  happen but he can print electronically money and as you increase the quantity
[18:55.000 --> 19:01.760]  of money goods that are scarce appreciate against the diluted value of
[19:01.760 --> 19:09.080]  the dollar and other currencies around the world now dr. Faber looking at that
[19:09.080 --> 19:13.960]  so you have all the major currencies of the world simultaneously engaging
[19:13.960 --> 19:19.320]  basically in the same big government footprint and huge deficits and thus
[19:19.320 --> 19:24.520]  devaluation of currencies so it's happening simultaneously it's a
[19:24.520 --> 19:31.160]  coordinated debasement of paper money and that's what the G20 admits they're
[19:31.160 --> 19:36.800]  doing meanwhile helicopter Ben Bernanke is delivering billion dollar bills out
[19:36.800 --> 19:41.400]  of helicopters but only directly into JP Morgan Chase Goldman Sachs and his own
[19:41.400 --> 19:52.200]  pocket and so now there's open talk that is correct it's funny it sounds funny
[19:52.200 --> 19:58.480]  but it's tragic because it doesn't reach decent people in America in fact through
[19:58.480 --> 20:04.640]  monetary policies they have impoverished normal people and let me explain you why
[20:04.640 --> 20:12.240]  first of all when you cut down interest rates to zero a lot of decent people they
[20:12.240 --> 20:17.560]  accumulated savings in the life they have these savings on certificate of
[20:17.560 --> 20:23.320]  deposits in banks or on bank deposits now even if you have twenty million
[20:23.320 --> 20:30.080]  dollars on zero interest you can't live so if the interest was a five percent on
[20:30.080 --> 20:34.560]  twenty million dollars you could I would have income of one million dollars
[20:34.560 --> 20:43.320]  secondly commodity prices went up and peaked out in May 2006 and then they
[20:43.320 --> 20:50.040]  moved Cyprus including oil which was prior to the rate cuts in September
[20:50.040 --> 20:56.960]  2007 at seventy five dollars at that time the combined expenditures for oil in
[20:56.960 --> 21:01.760]  the United States were approximately five hundred billion dollars but when
[21:01.760 --> 21:06.440]  Mr. Bernanke slashed interest rates to zero oil went to hundred forty seven
[21:06.440 --> 21:12.880]  dollars and the combined expenditures for oil in 2008 went to an annualized
[21:12.880 --> 21:18.560]  rate of a trillion dollars so the consumer you and decent people in
[21:18.560 --> 21:26.520]  America were saddened with another five hundred billion dollars in taxes and the
[21:26.520 --> 21:32.000]  beneficiaries of that were the speculators largely on Wall Street
[21:32.000 --> 21:39.320]  absolutely so we have the real economy being fed into the speculators or you
[21:39.320 --> 21:44.880]  have a pie and the pie has obviously through the recession becomes somewhat
[21:44.880 --> 21:53.080]  smaller but what is now happening the gangsters like Mr. Ben Bernanke and Mr.
[21:53.080 --> 22:00.080]  Larry Summers and Mr. Tim Geithner they take the smaller pie but allocate a
[22:00.080 --> 22:05.440]  larger portion of the pie to their friends on Wall Street and in the banking
[22:05.440 --> 22:10.960]  sector and to very questionable organizations like AIG and so forth
[22:10.960 --> 22:17.560]  at the expense of decent people who work in America
[22:18.080 --> 22:22.280]  so where is it where is it all heading I mean you talk about them hiring more
[22:22.280 --> 22:26.760]  policemen to protect themselves I was recently interviewed by parents which is
[22:26.760 --> 22:32.120]  a leading financial paper I said we all doomed it's gonna end in a complete
[22:32.120 --> 22:39.280]  disaster but we have to distinguish the disaster may not happen for five to ten
[22:39.280 --> 22:46.480]  years but we're heading into an iceberg and what will eventually happen is that
[22:46.480 --> 22:52.080]  the population will suffer very badly from inflation and declining real wages
[22:52.080 --> 22:59.600]  and the establishment including the government will protect itself and when
[22:59.600 --> 23:05.360]  everything becomes very bad and you have simultaneous essentially a recession
[23:05.360 --> 23:10.840]  depression like you said in unemployment is of course higher than 10% I don't
[23:10.840 --> 23:18.000]  think it's 22% but say maybe 15% when that doesn't improve they'll go to war
[23:18.000 --> 23:22.520]  and nobody can pay for the war so you print more and more money and you have
[23:22.520 --> 23:27.680]  hyperinflation and then the system goes that's why I'm telling everybody you
[23:27.680 --> 23:35.000]  ought to own some land and you ought to own some stocks and you ought to own
[23:35.000 --> 23:41.000]  some gold or a lot of gold and other precious metals because paper money and
[23:41.000 --> 23:47.640]  bonds are very vulnerable over the next five to ten years absolutely I mean this
[23:47.640 --> 23:53.880]  is a giant black hole of debt that's mathematically impossible to get out of
[23:53.880 --> 23:58.560]  and the system I have made the calculation I don't want to bore you with
[23:58.560 --> 24:05.880]  everything but when you consider debt to GDP 375% but that excludes the
[24:05.880 --> 24:12.840]  unfunded states liabilities the unfunded liabilities arising from Medicare
[24:12.840 --> 24:20.000]  Medicaid and Social Security are the coming due I mean the hole is so big we
[24:20.000 --> 24:26.800]  are doomed and that's what the private central banks set up they take over the
[24:26.800 --> 24:31.040]  world with fiat currency and credit they put out while it still has value they
[24:31.040 --> 24:36.320]  buy up the media the military the assets the gold they bring in a cashless
[24:36.320 --> 24:41.440]  society after they bankrupt at all and the entire world is a giant scientific
[24:41.440 --> 24:46.480]  police state dr. Fauber that is clearly from all of their own documents their
[24:46.480 --> 24:50.160]  own statements this has been a premeditated as you said concerted
[24:50.160 --> 24:58.440]  coordinated master economic domination what Napoleon Hitler and Julius Caesar
[24:58.440 --> 25:02.880]  couldn't do the private banks have done unless we identify them as the criminals
[25:02.880 --> 25:07.040]  and bring them to justice but even if we were to stop them today they have a
[25:07.040 --> 25:11.640]  revocably savaged us so bad is there any way to get out of this new world order
[25:11.640 --> 25:16.520]  well first of all I don't think so because I have to also say there's no
[25:16.520 --> 25:23.240]  political will because as you say the US Federal Reserve is actually a
[25:23.240 --> 25:29.120]  corporation in other words it's a private entity and it's most likely owned by
[25:29.120 --> 25:34.000]  all the banks in the United States but the point is there were voices in the
[25:34.000 --> 25:39.160]  United States that rightly asked for the Federal Reserve to be audited but why
[25:39.160 --> 25:44.800]  do they refuse to be audited if you have a business and someone comes along and
[25:44.800 --> 25:49.120]  says listen we want to audit you because we want to do business with you then you
[25:49.120 --> 25:53.440]  said sure if you have nothing to hide but if you have something to hide you
[25:53.440 --> 26:02.920]  say I refuse to be audited so I think the Federal Reserve is first of all 99%
[26:02.920 --> 26:12.480]  responsible for the Nasdaq bubble and the subsequent crash 99% responsible for
[26:12.480 --> 26:20.320]  the debt buildup and subsequent housing crash and 99% responsible for having
[26:20.320 --> 26:27.840]  misled people who simply from the education cannot make a decision about
[26:27.840 --> 26:32.640]  how much leverage they use when they buy your house because if you buy a house
[26:32.640 --> 26:38.400]  and you borrow only 50% on your house and the house may drop 50% in value and
[26:38.400 --> 26:45.320]  your mortgage is still not underwater but if you borrow 99% or 120% then you
[26:45.320 --> 26:50.520]  have a big problem and the Federal Reserve especially Mr. Greenspan and Mr.
[26:50.520 --> 26:57.720]  Bernanke and courage people to take second home loan mortgages and sir and
[26:57.720 --> 27:00.520]  sir dr. father almost had it we're almost out of time is why I'm
[27:00.520 --> 27:05.760]  interrupting and and so now here we are and their media is still putting out the
[27:05.760 --> 27:09.280]  hype that people's housing loans caused this they baited and switched day one
[27:09.280 --> 27:12.240]  with the bailout money and didn't use it for that and said we're not going to tell
[27:12.240 --> 27:17.200]  you where it's going they're clearly out of control Congress is talking about not
[27:17.200 --> 27:23.360]  re-approving the nomination of Bernanke for another term they're talking about
[27:23.360 --> 27:28.440]  inditing Geithner or making him leave but but but but then you just get rid of
[27:28.440 --> 27:33.200]  sacrificial goats we need to go after the entire system or as you said we are
[27:33.200 --> 27:38.080]  doomed and I try to explain that every real economist we're on Paul you know
[27:38.080 --> 27:43.680]  countless economists we interview dr. Paul Craig Roberts George Humphrey they
[27:43.680 --> 27:48.240]  all say mathematically impossible design to take over and you try to tell yuppie
[27:48.240 --> 27:51.800]  reporters this and they just laugh at you they think it's funny they think it's
[27:51.800 --> 27:56.440]  cute they think it's going to go on forever I mean the problem is that
[27:56.440 --> 28:03.280]  nobody in government and in the establishment wants to face the truth and
[28:03.280 --> 28:11.120]  even very decent people they tell you the truth but they are very diplomatic
[28:11.120 --> 28:16.880]  about the statements they make they don't say it's inevitable that eventually
[28:16.880 --> 28:22.640]  there'll be a huge mess they guard themselves very much but the mainstream
[28:22.640 --> 28:28.160]  and the government officials they keep on misleading people that is the problem
[28:28.160 --> 28:31.640]  and they know don't they I mean they designed it well I'm not sure they know
[28:31.640 --> 28:37.480]  because you know the intelligence level of government employees is obviously not
[28:37.480 --> 28:44.520]  very I'm at the bankers the the actual technicians running this I mean that's
[28:44.520 --> 28:49.040]  the real government is the banks even Congress admits that now well I mean the
[28:49.040 --> 28:56.960]  government basically financed by large corporations and by election campaign
[28:56.960 --> 29:02.800]  contributions and so forth and so on and then every politician then owes
[29:02.800 --> 29:07.760]  something to the people that gave him money that brought him into office and
[29:07.760 --> 29:14.160]  so nothing really gets ever decided when there is a crack in the building they
[29:14.160 --> 29:19.320]  don't fix the crack they just put paint on top of it and then two or three years
[29:19.320 --> 29:24.120]  later the crack reappears and they put fresh paint until the whole thing
[29:24.120 --> 29:32.080]  collapses Dr. Mark Faber is our guest gloom boom doom.com is his website sir I
[29:32.080 --> 29:35.640]  really appreciate you spending time with us and I look forward to talking to you
[29:35.640 --> 29:41.600]  again in the future take care. We'll be right back ladies and gentlemen with the
[29:41.600 --> 29:45.800]  news blitz and other guests coming up you'll definitely want to stay with us
[29:45.800 --> 29:55.160]  today this transmission is key. We're on the march the empires on the run Alex
[29:55.160 --> 30:03.280]  Jones and the GCN radio network. Hundreds of nations have fallen to

[30:12.600 --> 30:16.880]  Americans at home. I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in
[30:16.880 --> 30:21.760]  Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all
[30:21.760 --> 30:26.720]  of us as American citizens to pay attention. For the republic identifies
[30:26.720 --> 30:31.800]  the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying
[30:31.800 --> 30:36.520]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke
[30:36.520 --> 30:40.480]  their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who
[30:40.480 --> 30:44.320]  do we make the check out to. Today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[30:44.320 --> 30:50.360]  Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic. Yet your copy of fall of the

[32:04.160 --> 32:07.840]  good intentions. Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own
[32:07.840 --> 32:12.120]  food supply until there was none left at any price. We would intend to have plenty
[32:12.120 --> 32:15.360]  of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable to care for
[32:15.360 --> 32:19.440]  themselves. We would intend not to be standing in the bread line with the
[32:19.440 --> 32:23.560]  ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[32:23.560 --> 32:28.360]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence the bread line may
[32:28.360 --> 32:32.000]  have no bread. Just like the good intentions on the road to that on
[32:32.000 --> 32:36.280]  heavenly place the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not
[32:36.280 --> 32:40.720]  feed us. Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and
[32:40.720 --> 32:50.240]  fearless for the future. Call 800 409 5633 800 409 5633 on the web

[33:05.080 --> 33:11.600]  Don't call my name out your window I'm leaving.
[33:11.600 --> 33:22.640]  Don't call my name out your window I'm leaving. I won't even turn my head.
[33:22.640 --> 33:32.840]  Don't send your kin folks to give me no talking. I'll be gone like I said.
[33:32.840 --> 33:38.080]  You would say the same old thing that you've been saying all along.
[33:38.080 --> 33:44.920]  Lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut till I'm gone. Don't give me that.
[33:44.920 --> 33:49.080]  Immortal Johnny Cash. God bless you.
[33:49.080 --> 33:55.960]  Understand your man I'm party of that now then. Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[33:55.960 --> 34:01.120]  to 3 p.m. Central 12 noon to 4 p.m. Eastern we are here live back Sundays
[34:01.120 --> 34:05.800]  for an abbreviated 4 to 6 p.m. Central thank you so much for joining us. Here
[34:05.800 --> 34:12.920]  is what we have coming up today. We just had Dr. Mark Faber on breaking down the
[34:12.920 --> 34:18.720]  mathematical fact and I've had a guesstimation I've had more than 50 it's
[34:18.720 --> 34:27.080]  got to be probably more economists top economists on. I mean the former head of
[34:27.080 --> 34:32.320]  policy at the Treasury the former Wall Street Journal editor Webster Griffin
[34:32.320 --> 34:38.240]  Tarpley a doctor of economics Ron Paul just the list goes on and on telling you
[34:38.240 --> 34:46.480]  mathematically we are doomed unless we say no to this fraud and after the 28
[34:46.480 --> 34:49.480]  trillion according to Bloomberg now that's been stolen by the banks it's not
[34:49.480 --> 34:53.480]  700 billion that's an open window they do it over and over again that's only one
[34:53.480 --> 34:56.920]  part of it then they have the open window at the Federal Reserve several
[34:56.920 --> 35:02.720]  differences then they have SDRs internationally on top of that that's
[35:02.720 --> 35:09.000]  above the 28 trillion I mean do you understand these numbers and they're
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.800]  cooking the numbers they put out to the public to tell everybody everything's
[35:11.800 --> 35:17.120]  fine and you talk to the general public they know something's wrong but
[35:17.120 --> 35:20.680]  especially people that feel like they're part of the establishment they just don't
[35:20.680 --> 35:25.560]  get it that we are the Titanic we've already hit the iceberg and they are
[35:25.560 --> 35:30.040]  polishing silverware on the deck listening to the band play dancing
[35:30.040 --> 35:39.160]  drinking lemonade and people cannot believe that the G20 by design has
[35:39.160 --> 35:44.240]  engineered this they just cannot get it through their head that through fraud a
[35:44.240 --> 35:49.880]  global Ponzi scheme is taking over our society and it's going to get worse and
[35:49.880 --> 35:56.880]  worse and worse and the globalist are clearly setting up for worldwide war the
[35:56.880 --> 36:00.920]  globalist are expanding wars they are setting up domestic police states to
[36:00.920 --> 36:07.080]  suppress the once first world soon to be third world countries and my instinct
[36:07.080 --> 36:11.360]  is run to the hills but you can't run from this you've got to face it down I
[36:11.360 --> 36:15.280]  mean I don't particularly like having to go down in bullhorn the police
[36:15.280 --> 36:18.480]  department and bullhorn the media yesterday I'm sure a lot of you have
[36:18.480 --> 36:23.240]  better things you wanted to do but I'd say 300 people came out 80 90% of them
[36:23.240 --> 36:26.880]  conservatively were wearing info war shirts and Joker shirts it was great to
[36:26.880 --> 36:31.400]  and don't tread on me shirts from the info war shop I want to thank all of the
[36:31.400 --> 36:36.400]  great listeners that came out there and made it such a wonderful success and I
[36:36.400 --> 36:39.480]  didn't even mean to blow up at the police but watching them laugh at us and
[36:39.480 --> 36:44.240]  and take photographs of everybody with their big telephoto lenses from behind
[36:44.240 --> 36:47.960]  the windows and to know how they illegally shut down that gun show I just
[36:47.960 --> 36:53.000]  blew up at them we're gonna post some of that video in the next few days on the
[36:53.000 --> 36:58.960]  sites info wars dot com prison planet dot com prison planet dot TV but the
[36:58.960 --> 37:03.440]  attorney general is now investigating Rick Perry is saying he will investigate
[37:03.440 --> 37:08.480]  we'll see if that really develops and happens but the news is out there the
[37:08.480 --> 37:12.240]  country knows what's going on they know the Justice Department ran this the
[37:12.240 --> 37:14.960]  Justice Department admits they came and told the Austin Police Department to do
[37:14.960 --> 37:21.800]  this they called in Darwin Bedaker and thought he was the saxet gun show after
[37:21.800 --> 37:26.120]  they'd run them out they said no I'm the new guy that took the lease I'm the new
[37:26.120 --> 37:32.560]  guy I'm the new person and they said well here's the deal we're gonna shut you
[37:32.560 --> 37:35.840]  down if you don't do this so you just better do it and they told he be that
[37:35.840 --> 37:38.920]  then they tried to backpedal and say that they hadn't done that but now the
[37:38.920 --> 37:42.440]  good news is the truth has come out that they did do it and I know that most
[37:42.440 --> 37:47.760]  Austin Police are against what happened in our pro second amendment I understand
[37:47.760 --> 37:52.520]  that but but the thug like people laughing at us now some of the officers
[37:52.520 --> 37:55.960]  weren't laughing behind the glass I was sitting there looking into their windows
[37:55.960 --> 38:00.800]  and there were just scores of police staring at us mainly officers you know
[38:00.800 --> 38:06.480]  commanders and people and just being laughed at by them and having them sit
[38:06.480 --> 38:13.320]  there and surveil us and there was some provocaturing going on but it didn't
[38:13.320 --> 38:19.600]  work and overall it was it was a very very very successful demonstration so I
[38:19.600 --> 38:23.720]  salute all of my listeners that made it such a big success coming out there it
[38:23.720 --> 38:30.200]  was great great to see you there coming up Reverend James Manning continues to
[38:30.200 --> 38:34.600]  make national headlines boldly standing up to Obama and it's another testament
[38:34.600 --> 38:38.480]  to what any of you can do on YouTube if you have the same passion and focus
[38:38.480 --> 38:43.560]  always interesting interview and we'll find out the latest on his secret
[38:43.560 --> 38:49.320]  service slash CIA visit coming up at the bottom of the next hour Richard Reeves
[38:49.320 --> 38:54.760]  talk about his little interview with Rick Perry that was so key and also he's
[38:54.760 --> 38:58.120]  campaigning for Debra Medina she's gonna be on with us Thursday she thought she
[38:58.120 --> 39:02.400]  could be in studio in Austin today but they had to reschedule till Thursday in
[39:02.400 --> 39:07.800]  the last hour of the show before the big debate and they of course have thanked
[39:07.800 --> 39:11.880]  the show and all the activist listeners being instrumental again you the
[39:11.880 --> 39:16.920]  listeners calling below and getting them to stop the ban on her being in the
[39:16.920 --> 39:23.680]  next debate which is key just days ahead of the gubernatorial Republican
[39:23.680 --> 39:30.080]  primary that's happening early next month so great job on that front and the
[39:30.080 --> 39:36.000]  state of Texas is on fire with Debra Medina and again that's a message of
[39:36.000 --> 39:39.920]  the rest of the country of people running on a constitutionalist libertarian
[39:39.920 --> 39:46.600]  true patriot ticket that's anti-big government anti-gun control anti-war
[39:46.600 --> 39:52.160]  that's a constitutionalist position slash conservative we are retaking the
[39:52.160 --> 39:56.120]  high ground away from the rhinos the Republicans in name only and I
[39:56.120 --> 40:01.480]  challenge Democratic Party and and and I come in I don't really like Howard Dean
[40:01.480 --> 40:06.040]  and many facets I like Dennis Kucinich because he's real I don't agree with him
[40:06.040 --> 40:11.320]  on a lot of issues but he's real and they really torpedoed conservatives
[40:11.320 --> 40:15.520]  torpedoed it partially but liberals still in that paradigm torpedoed the
[40:15.520 --> 40:18.400]  healthcare takeover
[40:20.640 --> 40:25.160]  they they torpedoed it by actually reading the bill and finding out it was
[40:25.160 --> 40:28.600]  another boondog whatever the government does Republican or Democrat it's
[40:28.600 --> 40:32.240]  hijacked if it's a banker mail out it's a ripoff if it's healthcare it's a rip
[40:32.240 --> 40:37.000]  off for the insurance companies you know if it's a carbon tax it's to pay the
[40:37.000 --> 40:41.840]  banks I mean any if it's a flu hype it's to make money I mean everything they
[40:41.840 --> 40:45.920]  do is a scam so we're gonna be breaking that down I got a bunch of news I haven't
[40:45.920 --> 40:50.720]  gotten to and we'll be covering that in the next segment just huge developments
[40:50.720 --> 40:56.000]  but I want to go with our once a month visit with Marty Schachter of the Calvin
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.760]  Pierce soap company he founded it with his dad when he got back from World War
[40:58.760 --> 41:04.680]  two when Marty got back in 1947 they said you can't buy soap anymore it's all
[41:04.680 --> 41:09.040]  byproducts the petroleum industry industry called soap it's toxic he'd been
[41:09.040 --> 41:15.680]  in the chemical core he knew that and so they they produced truly organic made
[41:15.680 --> 41:20.880]  in America incredible soap and I found out about it because somebody that worked
[41:20.880 --> 41:23.960]  at Genesis just talking about how wonderful it was and Marty had never
[41:23.960 --> 41:30.080]  advertised Marty had never actually reached out to people he had sold factory
[41:30.080 --> 41:34.400]  direct and a lot of big businesses and institutions that understood they were
[41:34.400 --> 41:38.880]  getting 85% off supermarket prices and getting real organics you know the elite
[41:38.880 --> 41:43.080]  or some of the biggest buyers of his high quality products but now the last five
[41:43.080 --> 41:47.520]  years advertising on Genesis it is now available to you and so this is really a
[41:47.520 --> 41:52.040]  political action here like when I say bi organic that will take over the market
[41:52.040 --> 41:57.320]  where everything will be organic and that's starting to happen by I'm talking
[41:57.320 --> 42:02.280]  about organic food organic soap which really is the same thing as a food it's
[42:02.280 --> 42:06.120]  out of real organic products and so Marty good to have you on with us
[42:06.120 --> 42:11.200]  oh thank you Alex it's a pleasure to be with you this year and like we have it
[42:11.200 --> 42:16.400]  now I want to express a heavy and hearty thank you to the listeners and
[42:16.400 --> 42:24.640]  supporters of Alex Jones including you Alex for making 2009 our best year ever
[42:24.640 --> 42:31.360]  63 years and still counting absolutely can't thank you enough for helping us
[42:31.360 --> 42:36.520]  tell people what's in the soap versus the fake soap that's on store shelves
[42:36.520 --> 42:41.320]  well yeah they still call the products on the shelf soap but it's truly a
[42:41.320 --> 42:47.040]  synthetic soap a fake soap an artificial soap and they had a rename it
[42:47.040 --> 42:52.240]  detergent it's a new word that they created it doesn't exist in the
[42:52.240 --> 42:57.520]  English language but we make the old-fashioned from the 30s and the
[42:57.520 --> 43:04.520]  40s and the 20s going back many many years soaps made with coconut oils and
[43:04.520 --> 43:13.240]  vegetable oils no perfumes condensed concentrated to do the job honestly
[43:13.240 --> 43:17.600]  all you got to do is ask your grandmother or your great-grandmother what
[43:17.600 --> 43:21.880]  they used and they'll tell you they didn't have rashes they didn't have
[43:21.880 --> 43:27.200]  itching they didn't have deteriorated clothing because the soap did the job
[43:27.200 --> 43:32.840]  of cleaning without being destructive and the chemicals they use today it
[43:32.840 --> 43:37.600]  doesn't make it almost all the products are chemically made because it's
[43:37.600 --> 43:43.920]  profitable extremely profitable to make chemicals into a cleaner even though it
[43:43.920 --> 43:48.840]  does more harm than good that's right when they refined the when they refine
[43:48.840 --> 43:56.240]  the billions of barrels worldwide of oil every year most of it is junk and so
[43:56.240 --> 44:00.840]  they've got all this extra waste that they have to deal with and so it goes
[44:00.840 --> 44:07.080]  into literally thousands of different products and a lot of it is medicines the
[44:07.080 --> 44:12.640]  pharmaceuticals are synthetic synthetic vitamins synthetic soap it's not soap
[44:12.640 --> 44:18.040]  it's not vitamins and it's it's it's toxic it's it's bad for the environment
[44:18.040 --> 44:22.920]  but again you go to Whole Foods and places which are great and you pay more
[44:22.920 --> 44:27.240]  for organic soap because you're paying for the marketing and the shipping and
[44:27.240 --> 44:32.720]  the in the middle man with you it's really high quality or California
[44:32.720 --> 44:37.560]  organic certified one of the highest standards true American real soap and
[44:37.560 --> 44:41.880]  you save 85% off supermarket prices because there is no middle man you're
[44:41.880 --> 44:45.120]  going factory direct tell us about the product line and how folks get it well
[44:45.120 --> 44:50.320]  we have the product line is very limited we don't have a hundred items we have

[45:13.440 --> 45:17.560]  considerable amount of money out we were talking about thousands of dollars a

[48:35.520 --> 48:41.760]  they tell us part of folks that fatty foods help ward off strokes with
[48:41.760 --> 48:49.520]  paradox let's come to grips eat aspirin with potato chips man you're something
[48:49.520 --> 48:55.040]  else did you write that yourself Marty I helped clean it up okay buddy well

[49:03.760 --> 49:08.880]  character man I tell you okay here are the big stacks of news I mentioned some
[49:08.880 --> 49:14.920]  of it right at the start this is just giant news obviously we need to cover it
[49:14.920 --> 49:20.720]  in more detail I've got a big stack here as total fraud at the UN where they
[49:20.720 --> 49:23.920]  admit they're cooking the temperature readings all over the world fraud
[49:23.920 --> 49:28.440]  everywhere making money off of it total scams fear mongering people that the
[49:28.440 --> 49:32.040]  earth is going to die deadly carbon dioxide that plants breathe is you know
[49:32.040 --> 49:36.080]  just horrible and we've got to do something about it well look at this and
[49:36.080 --> 49:42.840]  again this is from Fox News but you can go directly to the executive summary of
[49:42.840 --> 49:50.000]  the report from the UN and the headline is tax and spend UN's RX for New World
[49:50.000 --> 49:56.480]  Medical Order and it says the panel of experts at the World Health Organization
[49:56.480 --> 50:00.640]  are deciding how to fund their worldwide operations these are the same folks
[50:00.640 --> 50:07.200]  that brought you the flu hooks and they say here a copy of the executive
[50:07.200 --> 50:12.160]  summary was obtained with the report and you read it and in it it's just got
[50:12.160 --> 50:17.720]  tax after tax after tax these taxes include and I'm reading from the news
[50:17.720 --> 50:21.920]  article not only indirect consumer taxes but also greater donations by wealthy
[50:21.920 --> 50:26.920]  governments as a percentage of gross domestic product and it goes into
[50:26.920 --> 50:32.720]  individual payments tied to such things such as mobile phone use health care
[50:32.720 --> 50:37.160]  lotteries new commitments from charitable and philanthropic organizations
[50:37.160 --> 50:42.560]  and the possible diversion of current philanthropic giving from developed
[50:42.560 --> 50:47.120]  countries into developed world health care and then it gets into all the other
[50:47.120 --> 50:53.360]  taxes they want and then they tried to deny their own report but all of this
[50:53.360 --> 50:58.800]  and more is in the Copenhagen Treaty that's public GDP taxes everything else
[50:58.800 --> 51:06.880]  stay with us our economy is in great distress the financial dominoes can
[51:06.880 --> 51:12.680]  fall at any time it's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in
[51:12.680 --> 51:18.240]  case it does you have auto and home insurance why wouldn't you have food
[51:18.240 --> 51:24.280]  insurance are you prepared to feed your family long term because it might take
[51:24.280 --> 51:29.880]  years to recover as the adult it's your responsibility to feed your family
[51:29.880 --> 51:35.160]  especially during rough times survivalistseeds.com is offering a

[52:01.240 --> 52:06.080]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[52:06.080 --> 52:10.640]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[52:10.640 --> 52:14.920]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I've turned
[52:14.920 --> 52:19.640]  a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[52:19.640 --> 52:24.920]  the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[52:24.920 --> 52:28.920]  attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the
[52:28.920 --> 52:34.120]  criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[52:34.120 --> 52:37.800]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists
[52:37.800 --> 52:41.320]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[52:41.320 --> 52:46.560]  checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[52:46.560 --> 52:52.240]  have seen a fall of the Republic. Yet your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD

[53:05.000 --> 53:09.240]  factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health? Because alkalizing water
[53:09.240 --> 53:13.560]  helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content
[53:13.560 --> 53:17.840]  of your body. Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses and cancer cannot
[53:17.840 --> 53:22.400]  survive in an alkaline high pH environment. Alchivision plasma pH drops
[53:22.400 --> 53:26.360]  combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals. Using
[53:26.360 --> 53:31.200]  alchivision pH drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get
[53:31.200 --> 53:35.840]  rid of acid and regain your health and energy. Simply put 10 drops in the water
[53:35.840 --> 53:40.400]  you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level. Most experts agree that the water
[53:40.400 --> 53:44.440]  you drink should be at a pH level of eight or higher. Order your bottle of
[53:44.440 --> 53:49.480]  alchivision plasma pH drops now by going directly to alchivision.com that's

[54:19.480 --> 54:33.960]  Obama administration orders World Bank to keep Third World in poverty. That's
[54:33.960 --> 54:38.160]  coming up next hour. I'm gonna read that article by Paul Joseph Watson up at
[54:38.160 --> 54:44.800]  infowars.com and prisonblended.com in full because it is a death sentence as
[54:44.800 --> 54:49.280]  Lord Moncton and others have pointed out. A death sentence. There's also another
[54:49.280 --> 54:55.000]  key story at infowars.com from good old Webster Tarpley. Please send this letter
[54:55.000 --> 55:00.400]  to your senators in opposition to the Bernanke nomination. Yes, that sends the
[55:00.400 --> 55:03.840]  message that what they've done is wrong. They're the bad guys. They have to be
[55:03.840 --> 55:09.040]  identified as the head of the state and Bernanke's in trouble. He may not make it.
[55:09.040 --> 55:12.760]  That's why Time and Newsweek are talking about great he is. What was it? Time
[55:12.760 --> 55:17.680]  gave him man of the year and praised him. That's like giving a peace prize to
[55:17.680 --> 55:22.440]  Obama expanding all the wars. It's a sick joke. It's all a sick joke. They think
[55:22.440 --> 55:26.000]  that they just shovel this propaganda on people. They're going to go along with
[55:26.000 --> 55:34.000]  it. But continuing with this executive summary report obtained internally from
[55:34.000 --> 55:38.520]  the World Health Organization, the report labels that the tax idea a
[55:38.520 --> 55:42.600]  particularly attractive option for funding health research and development
[55:42.600 --> 55:46.920]  and says that revenues from it would rise considerably if the profits from one
[55:46.920 --> 55:53.320]  or more high income countries was included. And so they call for the larger
[55:53.320 --> 55:57.160]  tax on GDP. Same thing that was in the official Copenhagen Treaty. They tried
[55:57.160 --> 56:02.040]  to get countries to sign on to. So to have them in this article denying it, the
[56:02.040 --> 56:08.000]  UN saying, oh, no, we didn't say that. It's just ridiculous. In a telephone
[56:08.000 --> 56:14.560]  interview on Thursday, Lopez Montano, I believe you pronounce it, declared that
[56:14.560 --> 56:18.840]  she did not understand. We were talking about getting cheaper medicines for poor
[56:18.840 --> 56:22.960]  people. How we could discuss this without talking about intellectual property
[56:22.960 --> 56:27.080]  rights. Frustrated. She says she walked out of the group's last working session
[56:27.080 --> 56:31.160]  December 2009 and did not return. But that's the person that again gave him
[56:31.160 --> 56:35.880]  the the executive summary. It says here. But again, you can read in the first
[56:35.880 --> 56:40.560]  paragraph or second paragraph of the article that the UN is denying this.
[56:40.560 --> 56:44.960]  Let me just read it. A member of the World Health Organization who panel on
[56:44.960 --> 56:49.000]  experts that is pondering new global taxes on emails, alcohol, tobacco,
[56:49.000 --> 56:52.760]  airline travel and consumer bank transactions has charged that she was
[56:52.760 --> 56:56.320]  given only selective information in group meetings. The deliberations were
[56:56.320 --> 56:59.400]  rushed at the group was manipulated by the international pharmaceuticals
[56:59.400 --> 57:03.880]  industry. She they claim this is all a way to give third world cheap drugs. But
[57:03.880 --> 57:08.000]  just like the insurance scam, it's really just a way to cut benefits and jack
[57:08.000 --> 57:12.120]  up prices and bring control over third world countries and their own
[57:12.120 --> 57:17.760]  production of pharmaceuticals. And so and to get literally in the in the
[57:17.760 --> 57:22.240]  aggregate hundreds of billions of dollars pumped into big pharma in the
[57:22.240 --> 57:26.360]  name of helping third world with their poison laced vaccines and drugs and the
[57:26.360 --> 57:29.920]  rest of it. All of her charges were strongly denied by the head of the
[57:29.920 --> 57:35.840]  whose expert working group on research and development financing. E W G a 25
[57:35.840 --> 57:39.800]  member panel of medical experts, academics and healthcare bureaucrats,
[57:39.800 --> 57:45.200]  which is due to present a 98 page report in Geneva on Monday after 14 months of
[57:45.200 --> 57:49.800]  deliberations on the new and innovative sources of funding to reshape the
[57:49.800 --> 57:55.080]  global medical industry. So the UN again completely being run by big pharma
[57:55.080 --> 57:58.560]  according to this person. Of course, the UN was set up by the military
[57:58.560 --> 58:02.080]  industrial complex in 45. You have all these conservatives, main line
[58:02.080 --> 58:06.400]  conservatives going, Get rid of the UN. It's anti America. It wants to take over
[58:06.400 --> 58:11.040]  America. No, the banks took America over and they created this institution to be
[58:11.040 --> 58:14.600]  the hub of all their international regulatory control that gives them
[58:14.600 --> 58:19.280]  governmental power. And so anything that comes out of it will be packaged as
[58:19.280 --> 58:23.440]  helping the third world when it's the opposite. All we need to do is look at
[58:23.440 --> 58:29.720]  State Department of memorandum 200 by Henry Kissinger hair Kissinger to find
[58:29.720 --> 58:32.520]  out exactly what they want to do. And that's devastate and control the third
[58:32.520 --> 58:35.760]  world. And that's what's coming up. Obama administration orders World Bank to
[58:35.760 --> 58:43.440]  keep third world countries in poverty. We'll be right back. Thank you for

[59:50.600 --> 1:00:00.400]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[1:00:04.480 --> 1:00:12.560]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[1:00:12.560 --> 1:00:20.960]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas. Alex
[1:00:20.960 --> 1:00:29.920]  Jones. Coming up, Reverend James Manning. Find out the new developments with the
[1:00:29.920 --> 1:00:35.680]  Secret Service and CIA. That's how they declared themselves visiting him. He has
[1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:41.720]  his employees, his witnesses, and he has really beaten the drum to politically go
[1:00:41.720 --> 1:00:49.640]  after Barack Hussein, the long legged Mac Daddy Obama, as he calls him. I just,
[1:00:49.640 --> 1:00:55.360]  you know what? If I went to an organized church, which I go to the Methodist
[1:00:55.360 --> 1:00:59.360]  Church, I like it. My parents go, my kids go every Sunday to Methodist Church
[1:00:59.360 --> 1:01:03.960]  here in Austin. But I mean, if I really went for some good sermons, it'd be, it'd
[1:01:03.960 --> 1:01:07.560]  be, it'd be some of these black churches with, with preachers like Reverend Manning.
[1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:13.320]  I mean, the, it's just great to listen to him. I mean, it's, it's like Martin Luther
[1:01:13.320 --> 1:01:18.600]  King, just, I mean, they are just great speakers. I, I don't know what it is, or I
[1:01:18.600 --> 1:01:22.240]  guess, I guess it's that passion. But you read about the founding fathers and the,
[1:01:22.240 --> 1:01:26.720]  and the black brigades as the, as the pastors were called, because all major
[1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:31.000]  denominations were black back then, most of them did. And just the oratory, you
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:35.200]  know, the text of the speeches they gave it. We need to get back to that. I think
[1:01:35.200 --> 1:01:41.920]  it's that the, all of the black churches have that old time fire that, that is so
[1:01:41.920 --> 1:01:49.000]  invigorating, but he is coming up, coming up in T minus, about 30 minutes. So he'll
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:53.160]  be with us 33 after, if we go to break at the bottom of the hour. And we've got him
[1:01:53.160 --> 1:01:57.640]  coming on and Richard Reeves in studio to talk about the gun grabbing that's going
[1:01:57.640 --> 1:02:03.240]  on his interview with Rick Perry and so much more like Deborah Medina, really an
[1:02:03.240 --> 1:02:07.720]  example of how we can take this country back. Very, very exciting to see everybody
[1:02:07.720 --> 1:02:11.800]  getting behind her and the incredible buzz I hear everywhere. My grandmother
[1:02:11.800 --> 1:02:14.800]  doesn't listen to the radio show often because I talked to her. She didn't
[1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:21.560]  hear about Deborah Medina from me. And I find it to be interesting because my, you
[1:02:21.560 --> 1:02:26.120]  know, she's my great grandmother to my children, really, my last grandparent.
[1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:29.680]  We've got such a precious, sweet lady. And my mother was taking her to physical
[1:02:29.680 --> 1:02:38.080]  therapy because she's on her 85, 86 and had polio. He's a tough lady. And so she's
[1:02:38.080 --> 1:02:46.120]  been on crutches since the fifties, but my, so she can keep walking and kicking.
[1:02:46.120 --> 1:02:53.040]  She's still sharp as a tack. My mother was taking her to physical therapy. Was
[1:02:53.040 --> 1:02:58.360]  it last Thursday and no, it was Friday and they were stuck in traffic driving back
[1:02:58.360 --> 1:03:04.080]  and my mom said, who, who are you going to vote for in the Republican primary
[1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:09.520]  coming up next month? And she said, Oh, no question. I'm voting for Medina. I
[1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:13.160]  watched her in the debate. So it was Medina in the debate, just the
[1:03:13.160 --> 1:03:21.680]  straightforwardness, the knowledge, the constitutional nature. If my 80 something
[1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:28.760]  year old grandmother is going for Medina, you know, that's why I'm so torn. I'm
[1:03:28.760 --> 1:03:32.120]  so torn doing this radio show. I wanted to go home last night and see my
[1:03:32.120 --> 1:03:40.040]  children, but I had to go down there and protest. It's a responsibility I have.
[1:03:40.040 --> 1:03:44.440]  You notice I don't do it a lot. I don't do a lot of public events. I just turned
[1:03:44.440 --> 1:03:48.320]  down speaking engagements all over the world, very lucrative, by the way, offers
[1:03:48.320 --> 1:03:52.160]  up and given just because I just want to cover the news and make films. And I'm
[1:03:52.160 --> 1:03:55.880]  just overwhelmed and I want to spend time with my grandmother. I want to spend
[1:03:55.880 --> 1:04:00.600]  time more found my family and not spend time talking to the media and
[1:04:00.600 --> 1:04:07.560]  everything else. It's just, um, but I have a responsibility and I know that
[1:04:07.560 --> 1:04:11.120]  we're dealing with pure tyranny. And so I feel robbed by the new world order of
[1:04:11.120 --> 1:04:17.280]  my time of my energy. It's time that you can't ever get back. Time is the real
[1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:27.920]  currency. And I don't know. I'm making some decisions right now about the type
[1:04:27.920 --> 1:04:35.040]  of work I want to do and what I want to do in the future. And the sick thing is
[1:04:35.040 --> 1:04:38.200]  the more I get attacked, the more I get lied about, the more I get demonized.
[1:04:40.040 --> 1:04:45.920]  It's like then I'm, it makes me even work harder. It's like I can't back off
[1:04:45.920 --> 1:04:52.720]  from a fight. It's that too. It's just, I just want to spend time with my
[1:04:52.720 --> 1:04:58.640]  grandmother. I want to spend time with my family. I got to fight these people.
[1:05:01.120 --> 1:05:04.680]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going
[1:05:04.680 --> 1:05:08.720]  into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do

[1:05:25.200 --> 1:05:28.800]  Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed
[1:05:28.800 --> 1:05:32.800]  yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out
[1:05:32.800 --> 1:05:37.120]  all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to
[1:05:37.120 --> 1:05:41.520]  fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.

[1:08:19.680 --> 1:08:30.480]  Texas. Alex Jones. All right, and ready for the news blitz, ladies and gentlemen. I think the most
[1:08:30.480 --> 1:08:36.880]  important story we're looking at is more than just a story. It's a fact of systematic, coordinated
[1:08:36.880 --> 1:08:42.720]  genocide. And we have it from the Club of Rome, the IMF, the World Bank, the Council on Foreign
[1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:48.000]  Relations, countless modern eugenicists that they want to cut off industrial development
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:53.360]  to the third world that will result in untold starvation, death and misery.
[1:08:54.480 --> 1:09:00.480]  Obama Administration orders World Bank to keep third world in poverty. That's exactly what
[1:09:00.480 --> 1:09:06.640]  State Department Moranum 200 said in 1973. More starvation, death guaranteed by blocking
[1:09:06.640 --> 1:09:12.640]  poorer countries from building cold-fired power plants. China builds, what is it, two or three
[1:09:12.640 --> 1:09:23.360]  a week? The United States doesn't. I mean, it's incredible. Under the proverbably fraudulent
[1:09:24.720 --> 1:09:28.880]  and completely corrupted justification of fighting global warming, the Obama
[1:09:28.880 --> 1:09:34.000]  Administration has ordered the World Bank to keep developing countries underdeveloped by
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:40.480]  blocking them from cold-fired power plants, ensuring that poorer countries remain in poverty
[1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:46.000]  as a result of energy demands not being met. Even amidst the explosive revelations of the
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:52.080]  United Nations IPCC issuing reports on the Himalayan glaciers and the Amazon rainforest littered with
[1:09:52.720 --> 1:09:58.240]  incorrect data, the U.S. government has stepped up pressure, that's a quote,
[1:09:58.240 --> 1:10:03.360]  on the World Bank not to fund cold-fired plants in developing countries reports the Times of
[1:10:03.360 --> 1:10:15.520]  India. The order was made by U.S. Executive Director of the World Bank Whitney Deba voice,
[1:10:15.520 --> 1:10:20.400]  I believe I'm pronouncing it correctly, who represents the United Nations in considering
[1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:27.040]  all loans, investments, country assistance, strategy, budgets, audits, and business plans
[1:10:27.040 --> 1:10:31.200]  of the World Bank entities, World Bank Group entities. See, when they go into a third world
[1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:37.040]  country and they give them compounded interest of over 30% where a billion dollars famously in
[1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:42.960]  Nigeria became 40 and then 50 and then 60 billion or 2 billion in Brazil becomes 30 plus billion,
[1:10:44.240 --> 1:10:48.960]  when they go in there, they then make the IMF and World Bank give them our tax money
[1:10:48.960 --> 1:10:54.320]  and then they're told who they can spend it with, with companies controlled by the IMF and World Bank.
[1:10:55.680 --> 1:11:00.960]  I mean it's incredible, this is empire, this is how they operate and it's an open
[1:11:00.960 --> 1:11:07.040]  secret, this is publicly admitted. That's why the third world didn't go along with the Copenhagen
[1:11:07.040 --> 1:11:10.880]  treaty because they actually read it and they had to make right at, it was like 49%.
[1:11:15.120 --> 1:11:17.600]  No, I mean it was right at double, I guess that would be right at,
[1:11:19.280 --> 1:11:26.880]  right at 95% above the cuts. So almost double that the United States and Europe had to make.
[1:11:26.880 --> 1:11:32.960]  By preventing poor nations from becoming self-sufficient and blocking them from producing
[1:11:32.960 --> 1:11:38.160]  their own energy, the Obama administration is ensuring that millions more will die from starvation
[1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:43.840]  and lack of access to hospitals and medical treatment. Not only does strangling the energy
[1:11:43.840 --> 1:11:48.720]  supply to poorer countries prevent adequate food distribution and lead to more starvation,
[1:11:48.720 --> 1:11:54.000]  but hospitals and health clinics in the third world are barely even able to operate as a result
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:59.040]  of the World Bank and other global bodies ordering them to be dependent on renewable
[1:11:59.040 --> 1:12:04.080]  energy supplies that are totally insufficient. A prime example appeared in the documentary,
[1:12:04.080 --> 1:12:11.360]  The Great Global Warming Swindle, which highlighted how a Kenyan health clinic could not operate a
[1:12:11.360 --> 1:12:16.720]  medical refrigerator as well as the lights at the same time because the facility was restricted
[1:12:16.720 --> 1:12:21.600]  to just two solar panels. There's somebody keen to kill the African dream
[1:12:21.600 --> 1:12:28.240]  and the African dream is to develop said author and economist James Shikawati.
[1:12:28.960 --> 1:12:33.840]  I don't see how a solar panel is going to power a steel industry. We are being told,
[1:12:33.840 --> 1:12:39.040]  don't touch your resources, don't touch your oil, don't touch your coal, that is suicide.
[1:12:39.040 --> 1:12:43.360]  And see, that's what the beers in Oppenheimer do in Africa with a 90 plus percent, I say,
[1:12:43.360 --> 1:12:49.200]  it's like 95% or more total monopoly over diamonds, almost a complete monopoly.
[1:12:49.200 --> 1:12:56.480]  Because they lay on the ground in Africa. They lay on the ground in Arkansas. They lay on the
[1:12:56.480 --> 1:13:09.520]  ground in many areas of Brazil, alluvial. And it's the same thing, by not letting us have clean
[1:13:09.520 --> 1:13:15.920]  burning coal that's in Utah, by laying that off, it more than doubled the only other major clean
[1:13:15.920 --> 1:13:21.120]  coal deposit in China, which they're all mining. And Clinton did that. I mean, it's just millions
[1:13:21.120 --> 1:13:25.840]  of examples. I mean, just goes, it's endless. I mean, it is millions of examples of how big
[1:13:25.840 --> 1:13:30.800]  corporations rig everything to their benefit. And they use government to do it.
[1:13:32.400 --> 1:13:36.160]  The program labels the idea of restricting the world's poorest people to alternative energy
[1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:40.400]  sources as the most morally repugnant aspect of the global warming campaign. That's the whole
[1:13:40.400 --> 1:13:45.200]  point of it. It's eugenics to kill these people. Obama administration or the United
[1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:50.640]  States administration orders World Bank to keep third world in poverty. Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:13:50.640 --> 1:13:55.520]  that's the article it continues. As we have previously highlighted, implementation of
[1:13:55.520 --> 1:14:00.240]  policies arising out of the fraudulent fear mongering and bias studies of global warming
[1:14:00.800 --> 1:14:06.800]  is already devastating the third world with a doubling in food prices causing mass starvation
[1:14:06.800 --> 1:14:12.240]  and death. Poor people around the world are being killed in large numbers by starvation as a result
[1:14:12.240 --> 1:14:17.200]  of climate change policy. The climate skeptic Lord Monkton told the Alex Jones show last month
[1:14:17.200 --> 1:14:23.680]  due to the huge areas of agricultural land being turned over to growth of biofuels, quote,
[1:14:23.680 --> 1:14:30.560]  take Haiti where they live on mud pie with real mud costing three cents each.
[1:14:31.840 --> 1:14:38.160]  That's what they're living on. Rather, they're dying on said Monkton relating how when he gave
[1:14:38.160 --> 1:14:42.560]  a speech on the subject to lay in the front row burst into tears and told him, I've just come back
[1:14:42.560 --> 1:14:48.080]  from Haiti. Now because of the doubling in world food prices, they can't even afford the price of
[1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:53.280]  mud pie and they're dying of starvation all over the place. As a National Geographic report confirmed,
[1:14:54.080 --> 1:15:02.320]  with food prices rising, Haiti's poorest can't afford even a daily plate of rice and some must
[1:15:02.320 --> 1:15:08.560]  take desperate measures to fill their bellies by eating mud, partly as a consequence of increased
[1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:14.800]  global demand for biofuels. In April 2008, the World Bank President Robert Zolik admitted
[1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:19.840]  that biofuels were a significant contributor to soaring food prices of global doubling that
[1:15:19.840 --> 1:15:25.280]  have led to riots in countries such as Haiti, Egypt, the Philippines and even Italy. Now they've
[1:15:25.280 --> 1:15:30.320]  got riots going right now, the last two weeks in Italy. We estimate that a doubling of food
[1:15:30.320 --> 1:15:36.160]  prices over the next, over the last three years could potentially push 100 million people into
[1:15:36.160 --> 1:15:40.880]  low income countries deeper into poverty, he stated. Even if we are to accept the fact that
[1:15:40.880 --> 1:15:45.120]  overpopulation will be a continuing problem in the third world, the very means by which poor
[1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:49.280]  countries would naturally lower their birth rates and the Royal Commission from England shows that
[1:15:50.080 --> 1:15:54.320]  would be by allowing them to develop their infrastructure is being blocked by the global
[1:15:54.320 --> 1:15:58.480]  institutions who craft policies designed to keep the third world in squalor and poverty.
[1:15:58.480 --> 1:16:03.440]  This goes to the very heart of what the real agenda behind the global warming movement really is,
[1:16:03.440 --> 1:16:09.200]  a Malthusian drive to keep the slaves oppressed and to prevent the most desperate people on the
[1:16:09.200 --> 1:16:15.280]  planet from pulling themselves out of destitution and despair. And it's even worse than what Paul
[1:16:15.280 --> 1:16:20.560]  Watson wrote. I mean, when you look at all the statistics and you look at what moderate decade
[1:16:20.560 --> 1:16:30.000]  cuts into 2022, just the next 12 years, you look at those numbers. And if they make even moderate
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:36.160]  cuts, and it was right at double, just shy of double the cuts in the treaty, they wanted Africa
[1:16:36.160 --> 1:16:42.560]  and Latin America and poorer areas of Asia to sign on to, if they made those cuts, it would
[1:16:42.560 --> 1:16:49.440]  conservatively kill an additional billion people. There are over 100 million people according to
[1:16:49.440 --> 1:16:55.120]  the UN's own numbers on the edge of starvation every year. More than 15 million people starve to
[1:16:55.120 --> 1:17:02.160]  death a year. In fact, I want to double check that number. Guys, pull up a yearly total number of
[1:17:02.160 --> 1:17:06.400]  people that starve to death each year. I believe it's higher than 15 million. And Lord Monty gave
[1:17:06.400 --> 1:17:13.280]  the numbers of how an additional five to seven million starve to death the last three years
[1:17:13.280 --> 1:17:20.800]  because of the biofuels. Oh, it's so sick. Now, again, if it's a biofuel from corn
[1:17:23.360 --> 1:17:29.600]  that would be used for food, it's bad. There's nothing wrong with taking garbage and food
[1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:37.840]  refuse and turning it into biofuels. I mean, that's a good idea. But
[1:17:37.840 --> 1:17:47.760]  and it is true that biofuels produce less toxic waste. I mean, we're not here saying that oil is
[1:17:47.760 --> 1:17:52.720]  completely clean, far from it. And we spend so much of our time and energy just figuring out what
[1:17:52.720 --> 1:17:59.280]  to do with it. But I mean, you just can't make the decision to say there's too many Africans,
[1:17:59.280 --> 1:18:04.400]  there's too many people, we've got to cut their food off. I mean, that is just an immoral decision
[1:18:04.400 --> 1:18:09.360]  that that that I will not in an elitist fashion because I'm not an elitist. But these average
[1:18:09.360 --> 1:18:16.080]  people and people making $100,000 a year, $50,000 a year, they think they're elitist. And it's just
[1:18:16.080 --> 1:18:24.400]  the, oh, there it is. Every year, 15 million children die of hunger. So it's 15 million children
[1:18:24.400 --> 1:18:28.080]  throughout the 1990s, more than 100 million children will die from illness and starvation.
[1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:34.160]  Scroll down. I want to see where this website gets its facts. I don't know this particular
[1:18:34.160 --> 1:18:39.680]  site. Other they're using UNICEF numbers. Yeah, mommy, probably accurate because that's the
[1:18:39.680 --> 1:18:44.800]  number I had already from the UN. Yeah, it's UNICEF. Scroll down to the bottom. Let's see if they
[1:18:44.800 --> 1:18:52.960]  have a have a fact line. I don't doubt those numbers. That's what it looks like. But I want to
[1:18:54.880 --> 1:19:00.160]  ask World Bank numbers, but I want to, I want to actually pull up a mainstream news article
[1:19:00.160 --> 1:19:06.480]  because people won't believe that. And I, and I'm getting, I'm really trying now. So what I do is
[1:19:06.480 --> 1:19:11.120]  always go from memory on issues. And I knew it was 15 million. I guess it's children. So there's
[1:19:11.120 --> 1:19:16.480]  even more adults. What is it? 5 to 7 million adults on then, I guess. So the total's over 20
[1:19:16.480 --> 1:19:23.600]  mil. I mean, I know that number. I've seen it millions of times, hundreds and hundreds of times.
[1:19:23.600 --> 1:19:31.120]  But I'm trying to focus myself to always double check everything, double check everything. And
[1:19:31.120 --> 1:19:36.960]  everyone should do that because you need to actually see these numbers for yourself. You
[1:19:36.960 --> 1:19:42.080]  don't need to just hear Alex Jones talk about it and then just say, oh, so what? I'm an environmentalist,
[1:19:42.080 --> 1:19:47.200]  you know, cut off their resources. And that's how they sold the well-meaning liberals for the
[1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:51.920]  Copenhagen Treaty or tried to sell them was, oh, we're going to help everybody. You know, we're
[1:19:51.920 --> 1:19:55.680]  going to take money from the West and give it to the third world. It was actually the opposite.
[1:19:55.680 --> 1:20:03.120]  It's giving it all to the banks. We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most

[1:27:30.720 --> 1:27:35.280]  i saw republicans acting like this for george bush and now democrats doing it for obama they
[1:27:35.280 --> 1:27:38.880]  think is it's their team winning you know that they're still gonna have their free speech but
[1:27:38.880 --> 1:27:46.800]  you're not going to have yours that's not how this works and you've got this widening chasm in
[1:27:46.800 --> 1:27:56.480]  society where either people are getting more awake more concerned more informed more involved
[1:27:56.480 --> 1:28:03.280]  or they're just getting more and more basted and married uh marinated and tyranny they are just
[1:28:03.280 --> 1:28:13.120]  just just slogging and and and sinking into it they are uh just uh just absolutely giving into
[1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:19.200]  everything all tortures good secret arrest is good gmo foods good fluoride's good i was talking
[1:28:19.200 --> 1:28:24.560]  to a reporter this morning and i said i'm going to send you a bunch of documents from the union
[1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:31.440]  of the uh epa the union itself saying take it out of the water it's deadly bone cancer all this
[1:28:31.440 --> 1:28:36.640]  other stuff and the guy just didn't believe me i couldn't get through to him he just kind of laughed
[1:28:36.640 --> 1:28:45.600]  and said no i think it's you know good for people's uh dental care and i'm just you can't they think
[1:28:45.600 --> 1:28:52.160]  we're lying they they think it's not true they think and they've got children they they've got
[1:28:52.160 --> 1:29:01.520]  wives they've got husbands i mean i've had so many reporters on the phone in magazine newspaper
[1:29:01.520 --> 1:29:09.520]  website interviews and radio interviews and they just laugh at me if you just do the research
[1:29:09.520 --> 1:29:16.080]  you'd find out how deadly fluoride is but see oh it's societally kooky to say you're against it
[1:29:16.080 --> 1:29:20.800]  because there's a doctor strange love movie by stanley cubrick i mean that every reporter every
[1:29:20.800 --> 1:29:31.040]  one of them brings that up to me every stinking one of them brings up doctor strange love and
[1:29:31.040 --> 1:29:40.080]  laughs at me and i i know i'm right i mean i know it's a fact i know i know i know that it's bad

[1:34:45.440 --> 1:34:50.160]  support what we're doing to do that last night when i was out at the protest a lady gave me a
[1:34:50.160 --> 1:34:54.720]  large donation and i gave it to my crew i hope that's okay with her but it really touched my
[1:34:54.720 --> 1:34:58.720]  heart she did that we don't really generally maybe once a year we will do a drive and ask for
[1:34:58.720 --> 1:35:03.040]  donations that's a listener idea we've done that two years and that's really helped our operations
[1:35:04.080 --> 1:35:08.960]  and given us the confidence to expand but the big way to donate and support us is buying the books
[1:35:08.960 --> 1:35:13.760]  the videos the t-shirts that are all massively discounted at infowars.com we're getting a
[1:35:13.760 --> 1:35:20.880]  prisonplanet.tv membership now for the balance of the hour we are joined by pastor david manning
[1:35:20.880 --> 1:35:30.880]  of otla.org otla world church uh there in new york city they're in harlem and reverend manning has
[1:35:30.880 --> 1:35:36.400]  again tens of millions of views online national television has covered him at nauseam attack team
[1:35:36.400 --> 1:35:42.400]  he got a visit what was it a month and a half ago or so back in november back in november by the
[1:35:42.400 --> 1:35:48.320]  boy time flies by the two months ago by the secret service and saying they were also cia with uh new
[1:35:48.320 --> 1:35:53.840]  york police so i wanted to get caught up to speed on what what happened there because you were
[1:35:53.840 --> 1:35:58.160]  expecting to be arrested but thank god that hasn't happened yet because you're so visible
[1:35:58.160 --> 1:36:03.280]  but i recap what happened there and any new developments uh reverend manning well they did
[1:36:03.280 --> 1:36:07.360]  come on the 16th of november and by the way thank you alex for having me on your broadcast today it's
[1:36:07.360 --> 1:36:15.280]  a real real pleasure and honor uh the they were here on the 16th of november the unannounced they
[1:36:15.280 --> 1:36:20.720]  kind of burst in on me uh had no idea they were coming could not be prepared for them
[1:36:20.720 --> 1:36:28.240]  uh but they came up cia secret service homeland security and new york city uh community services
[1:36:28.240 --> 1:36:34.800]  police now that's a nice way of saying riot control crowd control police department uh
[1:36:34.800 --> 1:36:41.440]  they came into my study where i was they happened to have been doing business at the time um
[1:36:42.480 --> 1:36:47.200]  and of course they asked me about the question that stated as something that i had stated to
[1:36:47.200 --> 1:36:53.840]  uh to kill the president well i explained to them and they were very well aware of the fact that
[1:36:53.840 --> 1:36:59.120]  what i stated was that i believe obama is the legal alien that he should be put on trial for
[1:36:59.120 --> 1:37:04.160]  treason found guilty and executed that's exactly what i said and and they were taken from a quote
[1:37:04.160 --> 1:37:10.560]  that i posted up on youtube um and i explained that to him of course i also explained that uh i
[1:37:10.560 --> 1:37:17.040]  didn't have anything to say to them if i was not under arrest and uh so they left now of course
[1:37:17.040 --> 1:37:22.400]  there's a bit more detail but i've explained this once but i just kind of i have since that time
[1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:28.960]  sent a letter an official letter to janet apolitano uh complaining about uh that intrusion
[1:37:29.520 --> 1:37:34.800]  by her homeland security group uh i've sent a letter to the york city new york city police
[1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:39.680]  department as well none of them have responded but i'm asking for answers why did they come
[1:37:40.640 --> 1:37:46.880]  obviously they know that i have the constitutional right to speak out uh and not only that but the
[1:37:46.880 --> 1:37:53.520]  constitution does call for execution when found guilty of treason in america so i suspect that
[1:37:53.520 --> 1:37:58.320]  there are reasons for coming with more nefarious or at the very least they wanted to intimidate me
[1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:04.800]  in that and their presence and their visit but i haven't heard anything from any of them since then
[1:38:06.080 --> 1:38:12.240]  reverend manning i mean i think you're a good guy i like you and i think you have a lot of courage
[1:38:12.240 --> 1:38:18.480]  me personally i think obama is just a powerful puppet of the new world order uh to give left
[1:38:18.480 --> 1:38:24.880]  cover to new wars and police state and banker bailouts uh but i also exposed bush as a puppet
[1:38:24.880 --> 1:38:30.720]  i mean i think that if obama got arrested and and tried for for i mean for treason i mean it's all
[1:38:30.720 --> 1:38:36.480]  the power backers that back him that would turn him into some type of hero and then some type of
[1:38:36.480 --> 1:38:43.440]  victim uh if uh if i mean that that that makes it all about the president but i guess from your
[1:38:43.440 --> 1:38:50.000]  research you you think obama is really running the show well no i mean i think i agree with you
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:55.680]  and as much as that he is indeed a puppet there's no doubt about that uh and there are those who
[1:38:55.680 --> 1:39:03.840]  pulled the string uh from my point of view i suspect that someone has to start being accountable
[1:39:03.840 --> 1:39:11.280]  at some point and at some level uh and and he is visible of course uh those who pulled the strings
[1:39:11.280 --> 1:39:15.920]  those who have been pulling the strings you i completely agree with you regarding george
[1:39:15.920 --> 1:39:21.280]  bush i don't think that uh obama could be president without george bush i think george bush and
[1:39:21.280 --> 1:39:26.800]  john became handed obama the presidency because of the the pulling of the strings from higher up and
[1:39:26.800 --> 1:39:31.200]  from various organizations that have been pulling strings for quite some time no doubt about that
[1:39:31.200 --> 1:39:38.400]  but however in my view i think obama needs to be brought uh held accountable and uh like obdula
[1:39:38.400 --> 1:39:43.120]  matala maybe he'll start talking on those who actually put him up to put the uh explosive
[1:39:43.120 --> 1:39:47.760]  in his underwear maybe obama would tell us who told who put the explosives in his underwear
[1:39:47.760 --> 1:39:56.000]  but i also think that obama in a large sense alex has influenced people especially in the black
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:03.760]  community uh and others as well in a way that's perhaps uh they're spiritual spiritually evil
[1:40:03.760 --> 1:40:10.960]  and that needs to be rectified as well what are you saying i mean give us the bill of particulars
[1:40:10.960 --> 1:40:15.600]  what is the trees and obamas committing them i mean the banks robbing us uh letting geithner
[1:40:15.600 --> 1:40:20.960]  and others uh keep the money for themselves keeping it secret lying about what the health care plan
[1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:27.600]  really did unconstitutional uh launching new wars going into pakistan um
[1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:35.280]  all of that all of that is a part of what he is doing may not necessarily be considered treason
[1:40:35.280 --> 1:40:40.480]  because there are certain mandates constitutionally executive privileges and power and congressional
[1:40:40.480 --> 1:40:47.120]  powers legislatively that he is able to do the uh the commander in chief that he's able to do those
[1:40:47.120 --> 1:40:55.040]  things you may be able to bring a moral case against him for the wars that he has uh continued
[1:40:55.040 --> 1:40:59.920]  um and but the banking idea the bill out for the banks you can bring a moral argument against
[1:40:59.920 --> 1:41:07.040]  that against him as well my my specific trees and charges are a simple it's the fact that he
[1:41:07.040 --> 1:41:12.640]  is not a u.s citizen constitutionally eligible to hold the office that he does not fit the
[1:41:12.640 --> 1:41:18.400]  constitutional bill of section two article one uh article two rather rather section a of the
[1:41:18.400 --> 1:41:24.160]  constitution to actually serve as u.s president there's a lot of information floating around
[1:41:24.160 --> 1:41:30.240]  and questions floating around that it just absolutely unprecedented and unreasonably
[1:41:30.800 --> 1:41:36.560]  uh being uh answers being with hell regarding his birth but i've got something else alex i want
[1:41:36.560 --> 1:41:42.240]  to talk to you about as well with respect to his education at columbia university or the alleged
[1:41:42.240 --> 1:41:48.960]  education economy columbia university but it is the fact that he is constitutionally ineligible
[1:41:48.960 --> 1:41:56.160]  that makes him a treasonous uh target well there's also the treason trying to hand us over at
[1:41:56.160 --> 1:42:03.600]  copenhagen uh to united nations control and and to get part of our gdp and other forms of taxes
[1:42:03.600 --> 1:42:08.800]  to the imf and world bank i mean if that isn't treason i don't know what is well you're absolutely
[1:42:08.800 --> 1:42:13.680]  right and that's one of the reasons why i keep following your uh reports on where our nation
[1:42:13.680 --> 1:42:20.880]  where our world is going and who's actually calling the shots up it appeared that the copenhagen
[1:42:22.720 --> 1:42:29.360]  world climate changed a global warming event seemed to have fizzled i don't think so i would never
[1:42:29.360 --> 1:42:33.600]  think that those people are as powerful as they are would allow it to have fizzled they're regrouping
[1:42:33.600 --> 1:42:43.760]  for whatever reason but it appeared to me that obama was poised to hand over america's sovereignty
[1:42:43.760 --> 1:42:50.800]  to the world government and and and and and exchange perhaps they would give him a major
[1:42:50.800 --> 1:42:55.520]  world leadership position that's what appeared to me that was going on and i still think it's in the
[1:42:55.520 --> 1:43:00.880]  work oh that clearly already i mean he's the first u.s president to become the chair of the
[1:43:00.880 --> 1:43:06.960]  u.n. security council absolutely that clearly violates the constitution we give the article
[1:43:06.960 --> 1:43:13.280]  sections in fall the republic and clearly he's trying to ced authority unconstitutionally and
[1:43:13.280 --> 1:43:19.840]  then that is the definition of treason is to swear an oath and then sell your country out
[1:43:19.840 --> 1:43:24.240]  to foreign interest no you're absolutely right about that no doubt about that and that's perhaps
[1:43:24.240 --> 1:43:31.040]  a more grievous one because then the insidiousness of of of actually doing that and conspiring with
[1:43:31.040 --> 1:43:37.440]  other nations so he would have to have started on this process then quite some time ago not during
[1:43:37.440 --> 1:43:44.880]  the election cycle but this and those who are pulling the strings on his presidency and him
[1:43:44.880 --> 1:43:51.920]  as a puppet would have had to thought about this years ago more than just recently absolutely
[1:43:51.920 --> 1:43:58.160]  uh expanding along those lines obama has the lowest approval rating of any president
[1:43:59.120 --> 1:44:04.960]  one year into office in history and and he got that record eight months in but it continues to
[1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:12.960]  slide at record levels i mean he's plunging in freefall uh right now and everything he's doing
[1:44:12.960 --> 1:44:17.440]  is falling apart but he doesn't care and now he has announced and his former head of cyber
[1:44:17.440 --> 1:44:22.880]  security resigned and said the pentagon is covertly taking over the internet and then obama came out
[1:44:22.880 --> 1:44:30.320]  it was cnet news you name it and said we're we may shut the web down to protect it and we are
[1:44:30.320 --> 1:44:35.040]  feeding everything through these nsa hubs now i mean that's treason against the constitution and
[1:44:35.040 --> 1:44:40.080]  dwarfs george bush's illegal spying but again it's just the progression of these puppets carrying
[1:44:40.080 --> 1:44:46.800]  out uh this agenda and i remember you a year ago saying that that the government and obama were
[1:44:46.800 --> 1:44:53.360]  going to go after free speech and now cast sunstein the uh regulations are is telling all the federal
[1:44:53.360 --> 1:44:58.560]  agencies that they want to quote ban conspiracy theories and they they say that means criticizing
[1:44:58.560 --> 1:45:04.400]  global warming europe wants to do that i mean this is it really is shocking that they don't care of
[1:45:04.400 --> 1:45:10.160]  the people are waking up to them they don't care if the if it's obviously criminal they don't they're
[1:45:10.160 --> 1:45:18.320]  so outrageous i'm even blown away i mean you're right you know i i you you you first started
[1:45:18.320 --> 1:45:25.040]  this thing but we're talking about his popularity ratings are in the toilet if you will and and
[1:45:25.040 --> 1:45:30.800]  going deeper and but i have to tell you i don't believe he cares about his ratings right now i
[1:45:30.800 --> 1:45:38.640]  think he there has been such a conspiracy to control this nation and other nations no you're
[1:45:38.640 --> 1:45:43.280]  right i mean he's on a mission they are go sprinting for the finish line right right so his
[1:45:43.280 --> 1:45:46.800]  popularity is not an issue with him it may be an issue with someone who's naive about what's
[1:45:46.800 --> 1:45:53.120]  happening but not with him they are in control and they're going to shut down i i expect i i
[1:45:53.120 --> 1:45:57.680]  know that i'm tapped i know that i'm listening to it everything i think the reason why i didn't
[1:45:57.680 --> 1:46:02.720]  make that clear earlier that the secret service came to visit me they wanted me to know you're
[1:46:02.720 --> 1:46:09.440]  being watched boy and we've got you on our line and everything you say and do we're monitoring
[1:46:09.440 --> 1:46:13.520]  i think they wanted me to know that uh and they're doing it but a whole lot of people
[1:46:15.680 --> 1:46:20.960]  and it's completely unconstitutional and it's outrageous i mean you you you've always called
[1:46:20.960 --> 1:46:25.520]  for non-violence and you're not calling for any violence against anybody you're simply saying
[1:46:25.520 --> 1:46:32.880]  this is treason absolutely and i think the american people need to wake up we still have
[1:46:32.880 --> 1:46:40.800]  a pillar of a chance uh to regain this nation and uh and we can go after the illuminati's
[1:46:40.800 --> 1:46:48.000]  and go after the bill de berg we can go after the power sources that are controlling our
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:56.160]  planet right now uh we can go after them if we wake up but if we don't what they see i think
[1:46:56.160 --> 1:47:01.600]  right now the internet is perhaps the most powerful tool that can be used to stop what's
[1:47:01.600 --> 1:47:06.960]  happening on in our nation and we better appreciate it and we better use it right now we still got it
[1:47:06.960 --> 1:47:11.760]  we're certainly better but you know it's waking up the american people is a major task because
[1:47:11.760 --> 1:47:16.400]  i'm sure you are very much aware of we're gonna need the support of it and the awakeness of the
[1:47:16.400 --> 1:47:21.760]  american people do you know who mark dice is no i'm afraid i don't well well go to info wars.com
[1:47:21.760 --> 1:47:26.880]  or prisonplanet.com and i believe the headline is uh what's our headline on our article about that
[1:47:27.600 --> 1:47:36.000]  it's it's uh mark dice uh what's the headline clueless in california mark dice gets people
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:40.640]  to sign petition to ban the first amendment and he said we want to ban free speech ban people's right
[1:47:40.640 --> 1:47:46.880]  to criticize obama in any way and the majority of them signed the petition and read it and signed it
[1:47:46.880 --> 1:47:52.240]  i mean now that's southern california but that is zombie like i mean that is the opposite of
[1:47:52.240 --> 1:47:58.400]  freedom these people are dangerous no you're absolutely right and it's only going to get worse
[1:47:58.400 --> 1:48:02.960]  um and then i've got you you've got what i referred to as the dung head media the others
[1:48:02.960 --> 1:48:10.000]  prefer to mess mainstream media who also are part of this process uh whether or not they're being uh
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:15.040]  paid uh or whether or not they're being given political power but they're promoting this
[1:48:15.600 --> 1:48:22.640]  ban on criticizing obama as well and in fact alex during the campaign when obama
[1:48:22.640 --> 1:48:27.760]  issued a decree that his name who say should not be used that was a form of a banning free speech
[1:48:27.760 --> 1:48:34.320]  and and and don't you know that the news media and others just stop using the name well it's
[1:48:34.320 --> 1:48:41.280]  worse than that in vermont of all places in illinois in missouri and and we have clips of it in
[1:48:41.280 --> 1:48:46.400]  fall the republic uh dr manning and i don't know if you've seen the film i should send you a copy
[1:48:46.400 --> 1:48:55.600]  where they they said we're truth squads and and uh that state officials and uh local da's were on
[1:48:55.600 --> 1:49:02.240]  tv saying if you lie about obama we're going to indict you not obama can sue you if it's proven
[1:49:02.240 --> 1:49:09.920]  to be a lie later they said if we see ads questioning him uh and they said he's a christian he wants to
[1:49:09.920 --> 1:49:15.040]  cut your taxes and if you and that's a quote and if you disagree with that you're going to go to
[1:49:15.040 --> 1:49:20.640]  jail they really were testing to see if they can just say sit down and shut up and people need to
[1:49:20.640 --> 1:49:26.320]  take this seriously the i mean these people mean business oh absolutely there's no doubt about it
[1:49:26.320 --> 1:49:31.520]  um perhaps more so than the average person can phantom and that's one of the reasons why people
[1:49:31.520 --> 1:49:37.360]  still away yeah i'm aware follow the republic and i'm aware of of the of that statement the uh they
[1:49:37.360 --> 1:49:43.520]  they not only mean business alex but they're in they're in control they're riding this wave of
[1:49:43.520 --> 1:49:48.480]  power that they have and they are not intimidated i mean who you're going to send to stop them you
[1:49:48.480 --> 1:49:52.640]  know i mean who you're going to call the marines and tell them to go after these people who you're
[1:49:52.640 --> 1:49:58.080]  going to send well that's the issue is that you're right they know they've got power they don't care
[1:49:58.080 --> 1:50:03.200]  they're robbing us they're setting up a police state and it's just getting worse and worse and worse
[1:50:04.240 --> 1:50:08.880]  well i think there is as you stated the internet is a powerful tool right now
[1:50:10.160 --> 1:50:16.320]  they can be at least stopped with the power of the internet but used effectively you cannot
[1:50:16.320 --> 1:50:21.680]  depend on the regular sources of dispensing information to do so but again it's going to
[1:50:21.680 --> 1:50:25.520]  take an awakening of the american people but if you read the article you just referred to
[1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:31.360]  to regarding people signing a petition stating that they are in agreement with any criticism of
[1:50:31.360 --> 1:50:39.280]  obama uh that should not happen and it shows you the fact how how how people's minds are so controlled
[1:50:39.280 --> 1:50:44.320]  at present that they wouldn't allow themselves to be constitutionally castrated if you will
[1:50:44.320 --> 1:50:49.520]  it's stunning stay there uh reverberating we're going to give you his website and more he of

[1:54:24.160 --> 1:54:28.000]  of really important news we haven't gotten to yet i've spoken some about it but i want to spend
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:33.840]  more time about the supreme court ruling i wanted to actually go read the ruling and it's as i thought
[1:54:33.840 --> 1:54:37.840]  let's corporations give all the money they want but it appears that the limitations because they
[1:54:37.840 --> 1:54:43.680]  write these vague so they can expand their power are still on private individuals giving money
[1:54:43.680 --> 1:54:48.880]  but not on corporations i mean this is a perfect storm of evil that is coming up the latest on
[1:54:48.880 --> 1:54:55.680]  Haiti but now listen every time i have a special guest on and i say it specifically for questions
[1:54:55.680 --> 1:55:01.280]  for them people call in about anything but we we do this maybe once or twice a week i say for
[1:55:01.280 --> 1:55:06.160]  this guest if you want to talk to him specifically questions about what they're doing or questions
[1:55:06.160 --> 1:55:13.040]  to them one eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one one eight hundred two five nine

[1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:23.440]  but right now it's for reverend manning reverend manning looking at this country and all the
[1:55:23.440 --> 1:55:28.720]  lies and we've really got 20 plus percent unemployment they say it's 10.2 they tell us the economy's
[1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:33.920]  getting better when it's clearly getting worse they are just just just openly attacking the
[1:55:33.920 --> 1:55:38.400]  second amendment on every front while then saying we don't want your guns but then all these white
[1:55:38.400 --> 1:55:43.200]  houses are say they want a total ban on guns all these white houses are openly saying they like
[1:55:43.200 --> 1:55:49.440]  Mao but they're not communists they're they're just a bunch of crooks i mean
[1:55:51.600 --> 1:55:55.920]  and then meanwhile you're getting demonized in the media calling this calling this treason but
[1:55:55.920 --> 1:56:00.640]  but you are seeing an awakening out there are you worried though that republicans
[1:56:00.640 --> 1:56:06.720]  are co-opting the tea parties and basically defanging them let me ask you a last question
[1:56:06.720 --> 1:56:13.760]  first i am convinced that the tea party is the controlled opposition perhaps more conspiratorial
[1:56:13.760 --> 1:56:20.960]  than the puppet masters that are pulling obama's string i mean it is it is horrendous to watch
[1:56:20.960 --> 1:56:27.760]  americans go down to the premrose path of thinking somehow another the tea party group is going to
[1:56:27.760 --> 1:56:34.800]  change washington in any way whatsoever but the other thing i think that i'm also noticing in america
[1:56:34.800 --> 1:56:41.680]  and uh... a lot of criticism has been leveled at me that i am a person that's advocating
[1:56:41.680 --> 1:56:47.520]  overthrow the government through violent means of course the constitution does provide on the
[1:56:47.520 --> 1:56:55.600]  right third of circumstances to overthrow tyranny declaration of independence sure yes um and but
[1:56:55.600 --> 1:57:03.600]  a number because i have been stating that i i sense in america that a number of people feel
[1:57:03.600 --> 1:57:08.800]  that that they have been pushed to the limit of uh... their sense of being an american
[1:57:08.800 --> 1:57:13.520]  that they've been pushed to the limits of freedom of being curtailed of not being taken completely
[1:57:13.520 --> 1:57:19.600]  and being marginalized big business has been given uh... the slogan too big to fail while poor
[1:57:19.600 --> 1:57:25.200]  people are failing or everyday working people are failing and being foreclosed and i i i've
[1:57:25.200 --> 1:57:31.920]  been stating that the only way that we can clean house not only must we remove obama
[1:57:31.920 --> 1:57:38.080]  but we must remove the power system and the structure that allows him to function
[1:57:38.080 --> 1:57:43.600]  uh... and the puppet masters and that requires a revolution i mean it isn't just about moving
[1:57:43.600 --> 1:57:48.240]  obama you put you take out george bush and put an obama and you've got the same problems going
[1:57:48.240 --> 1:57:54.000]  on you take out obama and put in anybody else unless the entire system is clean and that
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:58.560]  takes a revolution and people have to advocate and say that well i'm advocating violence that
[1:57:58.560 --> 1:58:02.320]  you know i'm about a violent spirit and therefore people like the tea party people
[1:58:03.040 --> 1:58:08.960]  who come in i was invited to speak at the tea party event on nine twelve uh... in washington dc
[1:58:08.960 --> 1:58:14.080]  in a couple of weeks before the event they called me up and canceled me and stated that i'm too
[1:58:14.080 --> 1:58:20.160]  incendiary i'm too fiery that i'm advocating violence and overthrow the government and on
[1:58:20.160 --> 1:58:25.760]  and on and on they went uh... but that's where we are with that process right now and then the
[1:58:25.760 --> 1:58:31.040]  truth of the matter is the house must america must be clean there must be a revolution in this
[1:58:31.040 --> 1:58:37.600]  nation alex well but the question is what type of revolution well i mean there's no doubt
[1:58:37.600 --> 1:58:43.360]  there's been a globalist revolution overthrowing our republic america's number one stories for
[1:58:43.360 --> 1:58:52.000]  independent talk radio for over a decade we are the gcn radio network this is alex jones with five
[1:58:52.000 --> 1:58:57.280]  good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[1:58:57.280 --> 1:59:02.320]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[1:59:02.320 --> 1:59:07.280]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[1:59:07.280 --> 1:59:13.040]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[1:59:13.040 --> 1:59:18.640]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[1:59:18.640 --> 1:59:23.840]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[1:59:23.840 --> 1:59:28.480]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator

[2:00:46.640 --> 2:00:53.120]  talk uh to the pastor uh look when you talk about revolution they know they're forcing the people
[2:00:53.120 --> 2:00:58.480]  into physical confrontation so they built up north com homeland security to get everybody used to
[2:00:58.480 --> 2:01:04.160]  giving up their rights to fight foreign supposed made up bogeyman terrorist but really we have the
[2:01:04.160 --> 2:01:08.640]  homeland security mic reports it's all designed for the american people libertarians conservatives
[2:01:09.360 --> 2:01:14.720]  people that want to end the fed uh the berthers you know they i mean it's all in there people
[2:01:14.720 --> 2:01:18.560]  will get us out of the un sticker it's clearly on america and it's clearly a secret police
[2:01:19.200 --> 2:01:25.360]  but i i i think they want uh violent confrontation that's why they they provocateur it but i do
[2:01:25.360 --> 2:01:31.520]  think we need a revolution of boycotts of protest of educating people of saying no of taking over
[2:01:31.520 --> 2:01:36.000]  the state governments the legislative process that's starting to happen to block the federal
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:40.160]  government's unconstitutional activities the federal government itself taken over by international
[2:01:40.160 --> 2:01:45.440]  aims i mean there's a lot of things we we can do i think the tea parties are affected but they have
[2:01:45.440 --> 2:01:50.560]  been co-opted by glenn beckon others and just his past attacks on ron paul and others i mean he's
[2:01:50.560 --> 2:01:55.600]  he's definitely a he's benedict arnold i mean i have to call him out because he's so dangerous uh
[2:01:55.600 --> 2:02:00.880]  but uh he's very dangerous about it so i mean so continue with your problem with with the tea
[2:02:00.880 --> 2:02:07.280]  party leadership and and and what type of revolution you're talking about well going to the tea party
[2:02:07.280 --> 2:02:14.000]  um the revolution aspect of the question first i think that the i've called for boycotts for the
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:19.280]  last year and we've been somewhat effective i mean i've called for the grade nine boycott of
[2:02:19.280 --> 2:02:25.280]  several major fast food places to all the auto industries all three of them tepsi and coca-cola
[2:02:25.280 --> 2:02:32.240]  simply to send a message uh to corporate america that we're out here we've got power we can write
[2:02:32.240 --> 2:02:41.840]  your checks or we can cancel them i've also called for a one-day work stoppage which i we've not yet
[2:02:41.840 --> 2:02:48.080]  instituted we've not made it effective as of yet but to have america stop working for one day now
[2:02:48.080 --> 2:02:53.600]  the tea party people dick army i think exploded that idea a couple of months ago and i called
[2:02:53.600 --> 2:02:59.680]  him out on it because i had called for it going back four or five months ago that america should
[2:02:59.680 --> 2:03:06.400]  shut down for one day completely uh to let the powers that be know that we're here and we're not
[2:03:06.400 --> 2:03:10.400]  going to be marginalized we're not going to be constitutionally castrated we're not going to
[2:03:10.400 --> 2:03:16.160]  have that happen and if they don't respond and the one-day work stoppage then we'll go for
[2:03:16.160 --> 2:03:22.640]  a full week work stoppage but of course you know alex once you do a one-day work stoppage
[2:03:22.640 --> 2:03:27.440]  those that are involved in the process will most probably be either arrested or and if you go for
[2:03:27.440 --> 2:03:34.960]  a one-week work stoppage you the power but the obama machine will call out the the military uh
[2:03:34.960 --> 2:03:39.040]  to try to put down that one-day work stoppage it will not happen in a vacuum it will not happen
[2:03:39.040 --> 2:03:45.040]  in a peaceful way and i'm not one that advocates shitting blood that's not something that i want
[2:03:45.040 --> 2:03:50.320]  people to think of me first of then however that's beginning to float around and i would like to
[2:03:50.320 --> 2:03:55.200]  repeal that as much as possible but alex i'm convinced that one of the more powerful ways
[2:03:55.200 --> 2:04:01.120]  of boycotting this structure the corporate this new corporate supreme court law that gives
[2:04:01.120 --> 2:04:07.600]  corporations the opportunity to buy candidates to buy elections that's exactly what happened last
[2:04:07.600 --> 2:04:13.600]  week and that you got to stop the corporations through the power of a one-week work stoppage
[2:04:13.600 --> 2:04:18.960]  there it will turn violent should that happen well what they did is they said oh you can't
[2:04:18.960 --> 2:04:25.120]  have a hillary film which is clearly unconstitutional so they expanded it using a ruling that was good
[2:04:25.120 --> 2:04:30.640]  to just say unlimited giving foreign companies foreign corporations can come in and take over
[2:04:30.640 --> 2:04:36.000]  even further but there's still the restrictions on what individuals can give absolutely so it's
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:40.720]  actually unfair for the corporation stay there let's talk more about that on the other side
[2:04:40.720 --> 2:04:49.760]  but but again that's the system panicking pulling out all the stops to try to pile on more money
[2:04:49.760 --> 2:04:54.320]  to shut us down to shut us up but the people are only going to wake up that much faster because
[2:04:54.320 --> 2:04:57.280]  things are falling apart they can't paper over that stay with us
[2:05:02.560 --> 2:05:06.640]  hi folks this is alex jones and i want to tell you about the silver lungs generator

[2:08:04.800 --> 2:08:18.800]  behind enemy lines the information war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:08:21.280 --> 2:08:26.480]  the supreme court removed limits on corporate labor donations to campaigns but the way i read
[2:08:26.480 --> 2:08:35.120]  this ruling they did not remove the three thousand dollar limit on citizens so we as human beings
[2:08:35.120 --> 2:08:41.520]  don't get to give more because that's what really threatens them but offshore corporations i mean
[2:08:41.520 --> 2:08:45.760]  that's treason right there and many people have written editorial articles saying that is treason
[2:08:46.400 --> 2:08:52.400]  by the supreme court but i remember criticizing them saying they couldn't have a hillary film
[2:08:52.400 --> 2:08:58.080]  that was funded by a corporation that's one thing but to say unlimited offshore campaign
[2:08:58.080 --> 2:09:06.320]  openly i tell you it's amazing it's amazing reverend manning well essentially what that
[2:09:06.320 --> 2:09:13.840]  ruling says alex is that only corporations will be able to vote corporations and their surrogates
[2:09:13.840 --> 2:09:18.880]  that if you belong to a corporation and you you are part of the the shareholders of that
[2:09:18.880 --> 2:09:26.000]  cooperation then you can vote for a few if you are an individual citizen such as you and myself
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:32.000]  and many others your vote will not count it if your vote will be dependent upon how much money
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:36.480]  you can you can donate and of course you'll be limited in what you can donate therefore you'll
[2:09:36.480 --> 2:09:41.440]  be limited and who and how powerful your votes will become that's exactly what that doesn't
[2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:53.040]  that we're being castrated where do you see this going i see this i i i i believe that the obama
[2:09:53.040 --> 2:10:02.880]  administration uh the world government powers that exist and that have existed believe that
[2:10:03.760 --> 2:10:10.800]  global power is more possible now than ever that they can unify this planet if you will
[2:10:10.800 --> 2:10:16.960]  they can make it a prison planet if you must and that there's really no one or nothing that can
[2:10:16.960 --> 2:10:22.400]  stop them right now they don't see anything out there that can stop them the only thing that
[2:10:22.400 --> 2:10:28.640]  they're trying to avoid right now now i do believe that uh martial law would be a great way in which
[2:10:28.640 --> 2:10:36.560]  well if there was an uprising or revolt or revolution that was not well planned it would
[2:10:36.560 --> 2:10:42.800]  give martial law and the power and obama the power to rule from his throne without any question
[2:10:42.800 --> 2:10:47.360]  however what they are trying to avoid and the reason why they're moving while they're moving
[2:10:47.360 --> 2:10:53.200]  at breakneck speed they could they could move more conclusively they're just trying to avoid
[2:10:53.200 --> 2:10:59.040]  people coming out with the 250 million guys that are in homes of america to overthrow this movement
[2:10:59.040 --> 2:11:04.080]  but they believe right now they're in control and there's absolutely nothing that can be done
[2:11:04.080 --> 2:11:09.920]  nothing that can stop this global takeover and the amassing of global power into the hands of just
[2:11:09.920 --> 2:11:17.360]  a few people they really do think america and the world is done and this is a scientific
[2:11:17.360 --> 2:11:23.440]  dictatorship it's really happening um but if they don't think the public will go along with it they
[2:11:23.440 --> 2:11:28.160]  will slow down and the good news is their health care is in trouble their Copenhagen is in trouble
[2:11:28.160 --> 2:11:34.800]  it's coming out all the u.n. fraud stuff that dwarfs climate gate on a daily basis now uh
[2:11:35.360 --> 2:11:40.720]  their flu hoax fell apart and i think that's happening not just because the public's awake
[2:11:40.720 --> 2:11:47.360]  and angry and active uh reverend manning but because police military bureaucrats people who
[2:11:47.360 --> 2:11:53.840]  are in there seeing this they're quietly not going along with it they're leaking information
[2:11:53.840 --> 2:12:01.200]  they're saying no and i mean i think we're in very very dark times but at the same time
[2:12:01.920 --> 2:12:09.040]  um well you know i think what you just i'm very much aware of what you what you stated how
[2:12:09.600 --> 2:12:15.760]  clear that is that people within the military within the police within the uh and within the
[2:12:15.760 --> 2:12:21.360]  structure of the government recognize what is happening they have not been made a part of it
[2:12:21.360 --> 2:12:27.920]  they will not be made a part of it and for those reasons a part of the process could be slowing
[2:12:27.920 --> 2:12:36.000]  down um i had one time thought that perhaps they may have lost interest in using obama as a front
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:42.640]  man the Copenhagen uh failure calls me to think a little bit i didn't have any conclusive evidence
[2:12:43.200 --> 2:12:46.880]  that perhaps they thought that they would slow down on him and perhaps pick another person to be
[2:12:46.880 --> 2:12:56.800]  the leader of this group but the other thing is that uh you know uh i'm not sure that the american
[2:12:56.800 --> 2:13:02.560]  people uh understand what what i was would say is that perhaps that what you're discussing right
[2:13:02.560 --> 2:13:08.240]  now we probably are not to discuss uh because there are a large number of people within the
[2:13:08.240 --> 2:13:13.440]  military who've been made aware of all of the conspiracies that are happening and this global
[2:13:13.440 --> 2:13:18.640]  takeover and uh we might be putting them at jeopardy at some point well that's just it
[2:13:18.640 --> 2:13:23.360]  about that i mean but i mean that's just it if you expose the program which we've done with
[2:13:23.360 --> 2:13:28.080]  the alternative media which is why they want to shut down and curtail the web and free speech
[2:13:28.800 --> 2:13:34.400]  if you expose them and we're telling the truth even if people don't wake up now as it unfolds they
[2:13:34.400 --> 2:13:41.680]  will wake up because it's almost like prophecy we have their game plan and you lay it out beforehand
[2:13:41.680 --> 2:13:46.560]  and then it happens as we say that really gets people's attention and i think that's what myself
[2:13:46.560 --> 2:13:52.640]  and many others and you over the decades getting the truth out has is devastating to them because
[2:13:52.640 --> 2:14:00.720]  i say it every day because it's so true lies have to be reapplied constantly constantly have to be
[2:14:00.720 --> 2:14:07.200]  reapplied over and over again but the truth just just just burns through the lies and so we've only
[2:14:07.200 --> 2:14:11.520]  got to wake somebody up we've only got to show them how they've been lied to and then they've
[2:14:11.520 --> 2:14:18.800]  opened their eyes the larger fraud um what you know you the where we're standing if you look at
[2:14:18.800 --> 2:14:24.960]  what's happening in europe and how europe is being co-opted and how they they've lost all
[2:14:24.960 --> 2:14:33.520]  their sense of democracy and freedom of speech um and and and the last baston of course here in
[2:14:33.520 --> 2:14:42.480]  america um we were indeed the the ideal we were the city on a hill if you will in terms of democracy
[2:14:42.480 --> 2:14:48.880]  freedom of speech and and and the best kind of government and and and and patriots of people
[2:14:48.880 --> 2:14:55.920]  interaction that has all been curtailed now the problem is that we've got a large number of people
[2:14:55.920 --> 2:15:00.960]  in america who actually believe that it should have been curtailed and they voted for it in this
[2:15:00.960 --> 2:15:06.240]  recent election with obama and as you made mention of the fellow dice i think was his name up in the
[2:15:06.240 --> 2:15:13.360]  earliest segment the californians are actually voting or believing that freedom of speech should
[2:15:13.360 --> 2:15:19.120]  be curtailed to some degree what has been what has happened is that there has been such a mind
[2:15:19.120 --> 2:15:26.080]  washing of of people through the through the media a large part of the reason why we've gotten to
[2:15:26.080 --> 2:15:31.360]  where we are and people are not aware of the constitution the schools have been stripped of
[2:15:31.360 --> 2:15:38.720]  teaching pro americanism constitution democracy the bible they've been stripped the institutions
[2:15:38.720 --> 2:15:42.880]  have been stripped people have nothing so they're an empty vessel to be filled let's let's go to
[2:15:42.880 --> 2:15:47.360]  some phone calls before around a time here you've been gracious to spend this time with us uh pat in
[2:15:47.360 --> 2:15:56.240]  ohio you're on the air with dr manning go ahead hi um alex and reverie manning hello um yeah i agree
[2:15:56.240 --> 2:16:05.520]  with a lot of what you're saying about president uh bush i mean obama same person yeah it is but um i
[2:16:05.520 --> 2:16:10.800]  think you've been a little too harsh when you say that when you call for the execution of him if he
[2:16:10.800 --> 2:16:17.440]  found guilty of lying about his birth certificate um sure he should go to jail or whatever but to be
[2:16:17.440 --> 2:16:22.960]  executed no even though it may be a law i think that's a little too harsh if anybody needs to be
[2:16:22.960 --> 2:16:28.080]  executed it should be president bush i mean considering what he did on 9 11 he was involved in
[2:16:28.080 --> 2:16:35.360]  the 9 11 event him and and and vice president uh cheney well nobody you know but i'm not going
[2:16:35.360 --> 2:16:39.280]  to sit here and and and call for that i don't want anything to happen to those guys because they're
[2:16:39.280 --> 2:16:44.240]  high-level puppets and that'll turn the whole system into a victim when it's the victimizer
[2:16:44.240 --> 2:16:49.040]  but pat i appreciate your call let me get a comment from dr manning on that well if the
[2:16:49.040 --> 2:16:54.240]  question is about capital punishment that you would be adverse to that then i can certainly
[2:16:54.240 --> 2:17:00.000]  appreciate it uh but if it's simply about the severity of the crime i think that the issue
[2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:07.520]  of the birth certificate may be the doorway but the severity of the crime what the illegal
[2:17:07.520 --> 2:17:12.640]  status has done and the number of people that have been injured as a result of him coming to
[2:17:12.640 --> 2:17:18.160]  power in the legal way might be a way you would want to consider that because if he's created
[2:17:18.160 --> 2:17:25.280]  great injury and and and been able to launch more wars and create more deaths than you you may think
[2:17:25.280 --> 2:17:30.160]  and may reconsider to say well it might be worth execution at that point and then the other thing
[2:17:30.160 --> 2:17:35.840]  is that founding fathers established that so that people would understand that fidelity to this
[2:17:35.840 --> 2:17:41.360]  nation is absolutely critical do not betray this nation under any circumstance or your life is at
[2:17:41.360 --> 2:17:48.960]  risk let's talk to julio in illinois julio welcome alex jones dr manning freedom fighters how are

[2:18:36.160 --> 2:18:41.520]  that the criminal offshore bank known as the federal reserve are looting us high and dry right in
[2:18:41.520 --> 2:18:46.160]  front of our faith let me move on to jays connor's we're about to go to break clearly i believe in

[2:18:51.120 --> 2:18:57.040]  your take on that the bible states is the borrower is the servant of the lender he who controls the

[2:19:22.480 --> 2:19:28.000]  yeah absolutely absolutely but the federal reserve i think most people are unaware of
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:35.040]  how insidious the federal reserve is how it was founded what it does and how it manipulates
[2:19:35.040 --> 2:19:41.280]  world government it manipulates if you will the growth of products and services and other nations

[2:24:04.160 --> 2:24:09.360]  let's move quickly to the calls final segment with reverend manning let's talk to isaac in
[2:24:09.360 --> 2:24:14.560]  colorata isaac you're on the air welcome gentlemen um i wanted to get reverend manning's take on the
[2:24:14.560 --> 2:24:20.960]  roman's chapter 13 thing with the whole fema clergy response team uh thing they're trying to
[2:24:20.960 --> 2:24:25.040]  push on all these reverend i'm sure you're aware that covertly we got the documents four years ago
[2:24:25.040 --> 2:24:30.720]  butch paugh got them but two years after they admitted they've secretly hired tens of thousands
[2:24:30.720 --> 2:24:36.240]  of preachers to covertly teach romans 13 give up your guns go to the fema camp we have preachers
[2:24:36.240 --> 2:24:43.680]  on tv admitting this uh and uh i mean is that your question in total isaac yeah yeah pretty much how
[2:24:43.680 --> 2:24:49.920]  he would respond to something like that well first of all i was not one of them but secondly uh any
[2:24:49.920 --> 2:24:57.680]  preacher who is paid to promote a particular gospel is no longer a preacher um he's no longer a
[2:24:57.680 --> 2:25:03.760]  servant of the lord but that understanding the government going after asking preachers to do
[2:25:03.760 --> 2:25:08.400]  that and then they act we have to do it yes i'm sure they've done it i don't think they've been
[2:25:08.400 --> 2:25:13.760]  very effective though um i think that's what has happened over the last few years more people have
[2:25:13.760 --> 2:25:20.880]  applied for and gotten actual permits to purchase guns and america is armed to the teeth right now
[2:25:20.880 --> 2:25:26.720]  that was the failed policy if you ask me america instinctively knew day one that obama was pure evil
[2:25:27.520 --> 2:25:34.160]  excuse me america instinctively knew the part of america that has a soul instinctively knew that
[2:25:34.160 --> 2:25:40.960]  obama was pure evil day one exactly exactly they did i mean they were then they're nor
[2:25:40.960 --> 2:25:49.040]  which i think spiritually uh the soul they said that something was wrong that they knew that this
[2:25:49.040 --> 2:25:54.320]  man was not right and began to defend themselves and protect their homes and and to protect this
[2:25:54.320 --> 2:25:59.760]  nation as well yeah the new world order is in trouble but it's still moving forward and the
[2:25:59.760 --> 2:26:04.800]  battle is joined the final big battles unfolding right now here in the united states the rest of
[2:26:04.800 --> 2:26:08.800]  the world i would think that the new world order recognizes that they've got a bit of a problem
[2:26:08.800 --> 2:26:13.280]  somewhere another something happened copenhagen has caused me to think that they've got a bit
[2:26:13.280 --> 2:26:18.080]  of a problem but they're in no way anywhere near defeated i can tell you that now and anyone who
[2:26:18.080 --> 2:26:23.600]  thinks that they are yes we've had a we've had some victories we've wounded the dragon but
[2:26:23.600 --> 2:26:28.480]  we've shown he's not invincible but he's certainly not that hurt uh appreciate the call isik tracy
[2:26:28.480 --> 2:26:36.880]  in new mexico you're on the air hey uh alex uh doctor uh nice to get on uh alex you said it
[2:26:36.880 --> 2:26:42.880]  perfectly that uh um the american people the ones that have souls and no right from wrong
[2:26:42.880 --> 2:26:47.920]  knew from the very beginning that this guy was the worst sort of bad news that we could possibly
[2:26:47.920 --> 2:26:54.400]  have thrust on us and now we find ourselves i think the last thing you said it may be slow
[2:26:54.400 --> 2:27:02.880]  deppen but it's still moving forward i hate that uh saying but um so at this point do we
[2:27:02.880 --> 2:27:09.200]  continue to do everything that we've already done we know it's not going to work or do we
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:17.600]  organize something that is a little bit out of the box that uh at least has more of a chance
[2:27:17.600 --> 2:27:22.400]  of working because well i mean let me be clear it is working they're failing on every front
[2:27:22.400 --> 2:27:28.400]  the problem is they've got the power and so they just keep going but more and more of the punches
[2:27:28.400 --> 2:27:36.080]  they throw are failing and and uh the answer is sunlight the answer is an awakening going to
[2:27:36.080 --> 2:27:41.920]  every hill and mountain every valley and in letting the people know that the enemy had net the gates
[2:27:41.920 --> 2:27:48.160]  it's in the gates and this is real and the republican tea partyoid takeover isn't going
[2:27:48.160 --> 2:27:54.480]  to save us but but again it's a manifestation just like the the brown being elected in massachusetts
[2:27:54.480 --> 2:28:00.080]  isn't a total victory but it's a message just like the purchasing of guns is a message i don't
[2:28:00.080 --> 2:28:05.520]  know i feel in my gut we're really really having victories uh reverend manning i'm convinced we're
[2:28:05.520 --> 2:28:10.080]  having victories and not only that i'm convinced that we're winning battles and i'm convinced that
[2:28:10.080 --> 2:28:15.280]  we're going to ultimately win the war i'm confident of that i i will give my word to anyone who
[2:28:15.280 --> 2:28:20.800]  thinks it's worth anything we will win this war and put it philosophically i mean i could go over
[2:28:20.800 --> 2:28:25.840]  the strategies that you outline so well every day alex but let me just put it in a way in
[2:28:25.840 --> 2:28:32.160]  the context of what you said about 20 minutes ago you said that lies have to be applied every day
[2:28:32.160 --> 2:28:37.680]  they have to get up every day and find and do strategies or the strength to apply a lie
[2:28:37.680 --> 2:28:42.960]  while the truth is constant and that's the thing that's on our side that's the that is the
[2:28:42.960 --> 2:28:49.280]  paradigm of the battles that we're fighting is the lie and a massive one against a truth that
[2:28:49.280 --> 2:28:54.880]  is universal that doesn't doesn't just stop here in america it doesn't stop with man and woman only
[2:28:54.880 --> 2:28:58.720]  it is a universal truth and that's what they're fighting against and that's why we're going to
[2:28:58.720 --> 2:29:04.560]  win ultimately this war we're out of time for calls i'll continue with your calls uh coming
[2:29:04.560 --> 2:29:10.400]  up after i cover some more news but i i do appreciate your spirit i appreciate i can

[2:35:02.400 --> 2:35:09.040]  that pearls before swine i don't think it is i don't think five million views though on that one
[2:35:09.040 --> 2:35:13.680]  channel for obama deception and a million and a half or whatever it is for fall the republic i mean
[2:35:13.680 --> 2:35:20.480]  there's hundreds of other channels and streams and bit turns and conservatively obama deception has
[2:35:20.480 --> 2:35:26.000]  been seen by i'd say 40 million people this has been seen by four or five million fall the republic
[2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:32.480]  there's no way to gauge what people done on the street the great folks at freedoms phoenix um out
[2:35:32.480 --> 2:35:41.040]  in uh arizona gave out over 30 000 copies at the university and in the town i mean on record gave
[2:35:41.040 --> 2:35:47.280]  out 30 000 copies i mean that is aggressive that is powerful that's the spirit that could save this
[2:35:47.280 --> 2:35:59.760]  country and everything we've talked about everything we've exposed in in in hindsight has
[2:35:59.760 --> 2:36:05.920]  been proven right and we are real and that's why the new world order hates us that they they hate
[2:36:05.920 --> 2:36:12.160]  fall the republic they hate the obama deception they hate end game because it is veritas it is
[2:36:12.160 --> 2:36:18.000]  truth it shatters the left right control bridle the governor system that controls people's minds
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:24.240]  and limits their thought processes it shatters the fake environmental movement it it it shatters
[2:36:24.240 --> 2:36:32.960]  the federalization of police and and north com and i just wish i could somehow sit down and talk
[2:36:32.960 --> 2:36:40.480]  to every american and reach out to them they've been brought up in tyranny incrementally they
[2:36:40.480 --> 2:36:46.400]  psychologically are too afraid to admit the full magnitude of it it's hard for me to admit it to
[2:36:46.400 --> 2:36:52.800]  myself consciously um that's why a lot of times i wake up almost every night at like 3 30 in the
[2:36:52.800 --> 2:36:58.640]  morning now just laying there in the bed going my god this is so real this is so big this is so evil
[2:36:58.640 --> 2:37:06.800]  and i am not perfect i don't have all the answers i get angry i get primitive i get very aggressive
[2:37:06.800 --> 2:37:13.920]  and i try to govern it it's almost like i want to stop jogging every morning because it just
[2:37:13.920 --> 2:37:19.680]  gets me more and more angry and more and more aggressive the testosterone because there's a
[2:37:19.680 --> 2:37:24.640]  natural man a red-blooded man when people are doing these type of bad things i mean it just
[2:37:24.640 --> 2:37:33.520]  creates not even rage or anger just just more than fury just like mechanized uh
[2:37:35.040 --> 2:37:38.000]  will to grapple with these people and
[2:37:44.720 --> 2:37:50.560]  i never said i was the man for the job i'm in way over my head but so are you we are all in over
[2:37:50.560 --> 2:37:55.920]  our head up against an elite who studied how humans operate and are using psychology sociology
[2:37:55.920 --> 2:38:03.600]  anthropology marketing drugging the population both overtly and covertly and it's so real and it's so
[2:38:03.600 --> 2:38:19.760]  big and to see the average person reduced by madison avenue to feeling insecure about themselves
[2:38:19.760 --> 2:38:27.360]  and to see the average person reduced and dehumanized and just turned into mindless vessels of
[2:38:27.360 --> 2:38:36.560]  dehumanization and to know there's so many other wonderful good people i mean i almost
[2:38:36.560 --> 2:38:46.960]  started crying last night when i was at that demonstration and i saw these families bringing
[2:38:46.960 --> 2:38:51.120]  their children up to me for me to shake their hand i just look at their innocence
[2:38:53.520 --> 2:38:58.800]  and i think about everything that our society's gone through everything it's going through everything
[2:38:58.800 --> 2:39:04.560]  it's going to go through and i think about all the children the neural orders killing cutting off
[2:39:04.560 --> 2:39:19.680]  their food and water and power supplies and stopping development and it blasted me i am i am like
[2:39:19.680 --> 2:39:27.600]  blasted by like the winds of tyranny and it it it's it's really made me stronger in a way is
[2:39:27.600 --> 2:39:35.840]  so much of my worldliness that we all have in the system has been just peeled away and torn back
[2:39:35.840 --> 2:39:43.520]  but i'm still this primitive weak creature but at the same time i have all these human attributes
[2:39:43.520 --> 2:39:49.920]  all the good things that are in humanity that that that paradox and the more i learn about how
[2:39:49.920 --> 2:39:56.800]  people work the more i understand about myself and others that we just would have had more time
[2:39:56.800 --> 2:40:01.840]  more time to recognize this earlier we would have listened to those 50 60 years ago that warned us god
[2:40:01.840 --> 2:40:10.640]  it's horrible people think perception is reality they think what they buy into is what is the truth
[2:40:10.640 --> 2:40:18.000]  and i've learned in my life to really try to search out what the real truth is and i just realized
[2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:27.440]  that we are a culture of lies a culture of people that have bought into so many lies and so many
[2:40:27.440 --> 2:40:33.600]  distortions and that's the offer of the new world order will drug you up will give you entertainment
[2:40:33.600 --> 2:40:40.240]  will euthanize you slowly you know it's the comfortable easy way to go versus trying to
[2:40:40.240 --> 2:40:46.720]  be an individual in this high-tech grid and and trying to figure it out something i do around the
[2:40:46.720 --> 2:40:53.280]  clock i dream about this stuff i wake up thinking about it i i constantly have epiphanies and
[2:40:53.280 --> 2:41:00.160]  incredibly advanced understandings and then later i read white papers written by top globalist
[2:41:00.160 --> 2:41:06.240]  that are as if it was written by me but with the evil twist of that they're just openly stating
[2:41:06.240 --> 2:41:14.720]  it and saying it's good and then to be verified to be to know i'm right you know i don't i i wish
[2:41:14.720 --> 2:41:22.480]  it wasn't true so i know that human weakness of of like just denial and no it can't be it it it it
[2:41:22.480 --> 2:41:47.520]  couldn't be the new world order is here to devolve and to rip apart and to trample and
[2:41:47.520 --> 2:42:03.040]  to stampede humanity it is a panopticon system to turn the world into a control freak sadistic
[2:42:03.040 --> 2:42:11.680]  psychopathic paradise a paradise of evil a paradise of blood and torture and pain and
[2:42:11.680 --> 2:42:19.920]  humiliation in fact guys google for me um search engine for me um 1984 and the term
[2:42:20.640 --> 2:42:26.560]  trampling and being trampled on i want that full o'brien quote when he finally breaks winston
[2:42:27.920 --> 2:42:33.760]  and and that's their religion and he leans over winston when winston now believes two
[2:42:33.760 --> 2:42:39.520]  plus two equals five because freedom is the ability to say two plus two equals four that really is
[2:42:39.520 --> 2:42:47.360]  freedom just and he leans over and he says now you see winston we are the priest of power always
[2:42:47.360 --> 2:42:56.160]  pressing on the nerve of power you know you look at my body the torture says the inner party member
[2:42:56.160 --> 2:43:00.400]  as he leans over winston a little newspaper propagandist from the ministry of truth
[2:43:02.400 --> 2:43:07.520]  and he says you look at the lines in my face and the blood vessels in my eyes and how i look
[2:43:07.520 --> 2:43:13.600]  like the life is going out of me but but but that's the vigor of the overall species the
[2:43:15.760 --> 2:43:22.400]  the the psychopathic uber species that's going to just tear down humanity stomp on humanity
[2:43:23.440 --> 2:43:30.800]  annihilate humanity just driving over it stomping on the human face forever and orwell had been a
[2:43:31.440 --> 2:43:36.080]  secret policeman in india he'd fought for the communist found out that was all rigged he'd
[2:43:36.080 --> 2:43:43.520]  been a top propagandist at bbc during the war and i've read just so many of his essays and
[2:43:43.520 --> 2:43:47.760]  letters where he was talking about this is the real world this is what they're building but
[2:43:47.760 --> 2:43:52.160]  huxley came along before he died and gave that berkeley speech and admitted it's all real the
[2:43:52.160 --> 2:44:00.240]  un plans to drug you dumb you down my brother you know runs a lot of it at unesco julian huxley
[2:44:00.240 --> 2:44:08.240]  and orwell had it wrong it's going to be a trojan black ski mask boot on the face but with an overlay
[2:44:08.240 --> 2:44:14.800]  of glitz and glamour and entertainment and drugs and drugging and and genetic engineering and and
[2:44:14.800 --> 2:44:24.320]  i mean he wrote that in 33 do you know how far past us these people are 1933 i can't read brave new
[2:44:24.320 --> 2:44:32.720]  world or brave new world revisited which is a nonfiction because i see everything they're
[2:44:32.720 --> 2:44:40.320]  doing to us and it's a joke it's a sick joke for them to crouch on us and to sit on our chest
[2:44:40.320 --> 2:44:49.040]  and to beat on us and and and to just throw it in our face put that orwell clip back up for me please
[2:44:49.040 --> 2:44:58.400]  i want to read that on air i saw that you did uh successfully pull it up there um for a moment matt
[2:44:58.400 --> 2:45:06.080]  ryan all right this is uh o brian while he is uh torturing him oh jaren you have it printed out
[2:45:06.800 --> 2:45:09.360]  bring it on in thank you brother
[2:45:12.800 --> 2:45:18.320]  this is o brian when he's finally broken winston and winston loves big brother and is ready to be
[2:45:18.320 --> 2:45:23.840]  killed they want you to thank them they want you to love torture they want you to love dehumanization
[2:45:23.840 --> 2:45:28.880]  think that's good all the movies and video games with the violence and where the evil guys are
[2:45:30.720 --> 2:45:38.320]  vaunted and supported exactly by making him suffer obedience is not enough unless he is suffering
[2:45:38.320 --> 2:45:43.600]  how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own power is an inflicting pain and
[2:45:43.600 --> 2:45:49.120]  humiliation power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new
[2:45:49.120 --> 2:45:56.880]  shapes of your own choosing do you begin to see then what kind of world we are creating
[2:45:58.240 --> 2:46:05.680]  it is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic utopia is the old reformers imagine a world of
[2:46:05.680 --> 2:46:15.040]  fear and treachery is torment a world of trampling and being trampled upon a world which will grow
[2:46:15.840 --> 2:46:23.760]  not less but more merciless as it refines itself progress in our world will be progress towards
[2:46:23.760 --> 2:46:31.520]  more pain the old civilizations claim that they were founded on love and justice ours is founded upon
[2:46:31.520 --> 2:46:37.440]  hatred and look at the controlled left all they do is poverty pimp inject race save you don't like
[2:46:37.440 --> 2:46:41.760]  big government you're a racist the the the very people that always claim to the liberals are the
[2:46:41.760 --> 2:46:49.760]  real the real dark-hearted eugenicists that just love exterminating the third world ours is founded
[2:46:49.760 --> 2:46:57.600]  upon hatred in our world there will be no emotions except fear rage triumph and self abasement everything
[2:46:57.600 --> 2:47:04.160]  else we shall destroy everything already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have
[2:47:04.160 --> 2:47:07.920]  survived from before the revolution yeah they were reducing the language down where people can't
[2:47:07.920 --> 2:47:14.560]  even communicate we have cut the links between child and parent and between man and man and between
[2:47:14.560 --> 2:47:20.080]  man and woman no one dare trust his wife or child or a friend any longer but in the future there
[2:47:20.080 --> 2:47:25.040]  will be no wives and no friends remember i played that clip from north korean slave camp where they
[2:47:25.040 --> 2:47:29.680]  take them and then let them breed for one week a year or five days and then separate the children
[2:47:30.320 --> 2:47:36.800]  i mean this is domestication but that's 150 years ago the british tacticians openly said this was
[2:47:36.800 --> 2:47:48.320]  the game plan and 150 years later it's here we're now entering it
[2:47:48.320 --> 2:47:59.840]  we have cut the links between child and parent and between man and man and between man and woman
[2:47:59.840 --> 2:48:04.560]  no one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer but in the future there will be no
[2:48:04.560 --> 2:48:10.960]  wives and no friends children will be taken from their mothers at birth as one takes eggs from a
[2:48:10.960 --> 2:48:17.840]  hen the sext instinct will be eradicated procreation will be an animal formality and notice
[2:48:17.840 --> 2:48:23.200]  horns actually making people not enjoy it now and to make it a reflex like going to the bathroom
[2:48:23.200 --> 2:48:30.160]  no passion no love procreation will be a annual formality like the renewal of a ration card
[2:48:31.040 --> 2:48:37.680]  we shall abolish the orgasm our neurologist are at work upon it now there will be no loyalty
[2:48:37.680 --> 2:48:42.080]  except loyalty towards the party there will be no love except the love of big brother there will
[2:48:42.080 --> 2:48:47.760]  be no laughter except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy there will be no art no literature
[2:48:47.760 --> 2:48:53.920]  no science when we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science there will be no distinction
[2:48:53.920 --> 2:48:59.120]  between beauty and ugliness there will be no curiosity no enjoyment of the process of life
[2:48:59.120 --> 2:49:03.920]  all computing pleasures will be destroyed but always do not forget this winston always there
[2:49:03.920 --> 2:49:11.360]  will be the intoxication of power constantly increasing and continually growing subtler
[2:49:11.920 --> 2:49:16.800]  always at every moment there will be the thrill of victory the sensation of trampling on an enemy
[2:49:16.800 --> 2:49:23.600]  who is helpless if you want a picture of the future imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever
[2:49:26.560 --> 2:49:30.000]  man and when you recognize the empire of the psychopaths
[2:49:33.120 --> 2:49:37.920]  that's that's what the yuppies on the left and the right all they care about is their victory
[2:49:38.560 --> 2:49:45.360]  all they care about is their trampling all they care about is manufacturing a fraud to pull down
[2:49:45.360 --> 2:49:47.840]  real men and people of honor and people of
[2:49:50.560 --> 2:49:53.840]  of will who actually feel and love and are open
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:01.200]  they don't like virtue
[2:50:03.600 --> 2:50:07.040]  and they're training you to hate your fellow man they're training you as the club of rome
[2:50:07.040 --> 2:50:14.640]  states in 1991 reprinted from 1968 that they're going to create a double pincer of fake terror
[2:50:15.840 --> 2:50:20.480]  and fake environmental crises to capture you like a pincer beetle captures its prey
[2:50:25.760 --> 2:50:30.240]  and i'm proud of what i've done and i'm proud of the fact i've been true and i'm proud of the

[2:50:50.800 --> 2:50:56.080]  understanding it's quite simple there's many who understand this but not many who have got any

[2:54:10.560 --> 2:54:16.080]  in 1814 we took a little trip along the colonel jackson down to mighty missus hip
[2:54:16.080 --> 2:54:20.320]  we took a little bacon and we took a little beans and they caught the bloody british in a
[2:54:20.320 --> 2:54:25.760]  town in olympia we fired our guns and the british kept a gun we have to understand that the human
[2:54:25.760 --> 2:54:35.280]  community is under scientific diabolical attack and we have to huddle together and educate our
[2:54:35.280 --> 2:54:42.720]  neighbors like our lives depend on it we have to love each other we have to just do little things
[2:54:42.720 --> 2:54:47.680]  like newsletters and posting flyers and calling in the talk radio and just be vocal until the
[2:54:47.680 --> 2:54:57.600]  crescendo rises and people discover the psychopathic empire again i'm not afraid of being set up or
[2:54:57.600 --> 2:55:04.320]  destroyed or lied about and all the hatchet jobs except that i am now a symbol a leader
[2:55:04.960 --> 2:55:09.600]  and i've not been perfect in everything i've done and they can cobble it together and twist it
[2:55:09.600 --> 2:55:18.240]  and so because i am this symbol i of resistance and liberty one of the main symbols worldwide now
[2:55:19.360 --> 2:55:24.080]  and they see our growth and understand what we're doing just understand folks we are under
[2:55:24.080 --> 2:55:31.040]  dramatic sustained attack from all sides coantel pro you name it very dangerous groups in austin
[2:55:31.040 --> 2:55:40.640]  operating and if you give into the coantel pro and cover it then that gives them the power if
[2:55:40.640 --> 2:55:51.840]  you sue them that then ties you up but it's just it's so massive it's so huge but if we simply
[2:55:51.840 --> 2:55:56.160]  activate and realize just how bad it is and start educating others we can stop them
[2:55:56.160 --> 2:56:05.440]  now we are the priest of power o brian said to winston god is power this is before they'd
[2:56:05.440 --> 2:56:12.240]  broken winston o brian while torturing and we are the priest of power winston god is power
[2:56:15.200 --> 2:56:21.840]  but at present power is only a word so far as you are concerned it is time for you to gather
[2:56:21.840 --> 2:56:27.760]  some idea of what power means the first thing you must realize is that power is collective
[2:56:27.760 --> 2:56:32.800]  the individual only has power and so far as he ceases to be an individual you know the party
[2:56:32.800 --> 2:56:40.880]  slogan freedom is slavery has it ever occurred to you that it is reversible slavery is freedom
[2:56:43.280 --> 2:56:48.560]  alone free the human being is always defeated it must be so because every human being is doomed
[2:56:48.560 --> 2:56:54.640]  to die which is the greatest of all failures but if he can make complete utter submission as the
[2:56:54.640 --> 2:57:00.720]  globalists have done to their cult their psycho power cult it has if he can escape from his identity
[2:57:00.720 --> 2:57:06.720]  if he can merge himself in the party so that the party and that he is the party then he is all
[2:57:06.720 --> 2:57:12.160]  powerful and immortal the second thing for you to realize is that power is power over human beings
[2:57:12.160 --> 2:57:20.480]  over the body but above all over mind power over matter external reality as you would call it
[2:57:20.480 --> 2:57:28.480]  is not important already our control over matter is absolute because they believe in
[2:57:28.480 --> 2:57:35.760]  perception he goes on to say the lie that perception is reality if you're hallucinating
[2:57:35.760 --> 2:57:41.680]  on pcp and jump off a hundred story balcony window and you believe you're flying and you're a butterfly
[2:57:41.680 --> 2:57:48.240]  it's not real when you hit the concrete reality comes but they're saying no we can have americans
[2:57:48.240 --> 2:57:54.640]  say ban free speech it's freedom we can say shut down the gun show it's freedom we can say kill a
[2:57:54.640 --> 2:58:02.000]  million iraqis it's freedom notice how they're obsessed with controlling the weather the white
[2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:06.320]  house science argue speeches about how they're manipulating the weather and then you talk to
[2:58:06.320 --> 2:58:11.520]  reporters and they can't even fathom it because big brother separately said this doesn't exist
[2:58:11.520 --> 2:58:20.560]  but we're doing it two plus two equals five and i say no freedom is the power to say two plus two
[2:58:20.560 --> 2:58:29.440]  equals four monsanto does know that their corn is attacking people's organs they do know it kills
[2:58:29.440 --> 2:58:37.120]  the lab animals people must face that they must face it's premeditated it is known everything
[2:58:37.120 --> 2:58:48.320]  they're doing is by design thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today
[2:58:50.720 --> 2:58:55.360]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[2:58:55.360 --> 2:59:00.480]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[2:59:00.480 --> 2:59:05.360]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[2:59:05.360 --> 2:59:10.960]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[2:59:10.960 --> 2:59:16.000]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[2:59:16.000 --> 2:59:21.440]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always
[2:59:21.440 --> 2:59:25.920]  a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[2:59:25.920 --> 2:59:31.760]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks
[2:59:31.760 --> 2:59:35.520]  i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my

[2:59:50.240 --> 2:59:59.200]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[2:59:59.200 --> 3:00:10.160]  it's
[3:00:14.080 --> 3:00:17.360]  Richard Reeves is scheduled to be in studio with us in 30 minutes
[3:00:22.240 --> 3:00:27.120]  if you question the big brother level of fraud look at how the un has now been forced to admit
[3:00:27.120 --> 3:00:32.080]  they've been engaged in premeditated fraud on climate gate on the Himalayas on the temperature
[3:00:32.080 --> 3:00:36.800]  readings across the planet un documents have been released the last three months we've covered
[3:00:36.800 --> 3:00:43.760]  here on air where they organized scores of key universities worldwide to collate the data create
[3:00:43.760 --> 3:00:48.960]  the fraud they say in the documents that these are fellow travelers for world government i mean
[3:00:48.960 --> 3:00:54.560]  this is a cult of control freaks that want to run your life want to control your speech disarm you
[3:00:54.560 --> 3:00:56.880]  you heard you into compact cities
[3:01:01.280 --> 3:01:06.480]  look at how their fraud on the flu shot has been exposed look at how it's now come out
[3:01:06.480 --> 3:01:11.120]  i mean how dumb do they think you were sure one big group of the population will buy anything but
[3:01:11.120 --> 3:01:17.200]  others don't now that's the good news there is hope we're not in this total 1984 society yet but
[3:01:17.200 --> 3:01:22.640]  we've got to fight and struggle against it now and 90 percent of the battle as the pentagon says
[3:01:22.640 --> 3:01:30.400]  or as o brian the fictional big brother enforcer would say all of it is in the mind
[3:01:31.840 --> 3:01:37.280]  because they're selling a lie when cbs news locally tells you mercury is good for your
[3:01:37.280 --> 3:01:42.400]  children's brains i mean can you imagine o brian he's saying winston you must agree that two plus
[3:01:42.400 --> 3:01:49.200]  two equals five and winston's like no and then later he tortures him he says okay it two plus two
[3:01:49.200 --> 3:01:53.760]  equals five i agree with you said no you don't really believe it he tortures him for months more
[3:01:53.760 --> 3:02:00.880]  his teeth all fall out and he stands him up and says look at you look at apathetic you are
[3:02:01.520 --> 3:02:09.520]  he tortures him some more and then winston sees the two fingers merge into five he sees the groups
[3:02:09.520 --> 3:02:17.600]  of two fingers merge into five he oh it is five mercury is good for me i monsanto doesn't want
[3:02:17.600 --> 3:02:23.360]  to hurt me uh monsanto okay sure it's killing me but we can't talk about or do anything about it
[3:02:23.360 --> 3:02:29.200]  because you know that would be unfriendly towards monsanto uh they might come after me
[3:02:29.200 --> 3:02:34.160]  they might sue me if i read the official medical studies on it and tell people
[3:02:37.440 --> 3:02:42.640]  that is two plus two equals five and people do it every day going oh yes i think we should
[3:02:42.640 --> 3:02:51.360]  ban free speech oh yes i think we should ban the guns well that's not in the constitution see they
[3:02:51.360 --> 3:03:00.640]  start out with with equations that are more complex like well does 997 plus 1422 come up
[3:03:00.640 --> 3:03:05.440]  to this number and it's a wrong number but you're lazy and go i'll just believe it's whatever you
[3:03:05.440 --> 3:03:10.880]  say it is and then pretty soon they say two plus two does not equal four it equals five or 10 or
[3:03:10.880 --> 3:03:20.800]  20 or whatever we say and and so they're practicing that lie on you to i mean to come out and say
[3:03:20.800 --> 3:03:25.360]  here's the fact sheet we're going to give you at the that the feds wrote up at the school or the
[3:03:25.360 --> 3:03:31.920]  government building or uh at the uh pharmacy and here's a little fact sheet it has no mercury in it
[3:03:31.920 --> 3:03:36.000]  we've shown you these over and over again side by side does it cause any problems doesn't have any
[3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:43.920]  neurological disorders can't hurt you and then you actually get the insert and it admits all the
[3:03:43.920 --> 3:03:53.360]  bad things it can do to you see they think you're so stupid they're bold they're bold now there is
[3:03:53.360 --> 3:04:03.520]  still time to change this several tv stations i saw the newscast on youtube ran pieces that were
[3:04:03.520 --> 3:04:11.040]  90 truth last night cbs and the reporter came over and said i'm a listener he was very he had a very
[3:04:11.040 --> 3:04:18.080]  i mean he was real he and he was like okay fine let us try to get it right and they got it pretty close
[3:04:20.480 --> 3:04:24.480]  so see they weren't evil and diabolical they were just going with the peer pressure of the
[3:04:24.480 --> 3:04:28.640]  atf of the austin police department that's what the guy said he said we just reported what they told
[3:04:28.640 --> 3:04:34.640]  us alex but see you didn't go look it up they even said on the news alex claims this is the federal
[3:04:34.640 --> 3:04:39.600]  law as i read it on air but at least they did that that there is no that the law is you can have
[3:04:39.600 --> 3:04:44.560]  private cell of firearms we turned them around because i screamed at them i went and got in their
[3:04:44.560 --> 3:04:49.440]  face and rebuked them i didn't sit up there in a little beauty pageant barely talking on a megaphone
[3:04:49.440 --> 3:04:56.880]  where nobody could hear you know oh you know no i was there to wage war on fraud wage war on lies

[3:08:09.440 --> 3:08:15.760]  okay let's go to your phone calls let's talk to david nuklahoma david you're on the air welcome sir
[3:08:16.800 --> 3:08:24.560]  hello welcome hey alex uh first off i just want to say i thank god for you and what you do um i
[3:08:24.560 --> 3:08:30.800]  was awakened about uh a little over a year ago and the process eventually led me to the obama
[3:08:30.800 --> 3:08:38.720]  deception and in game and loose change and dr stanley mon teeth read his book brotherhood of
[3:08:38.720 --> 3:08:44.480]  darkness in the whole nine the thing that i wanted to ask is i'm a christian and i've read the bible
[3:08:44.480 --> 3:08:50.800]  cover to cover several times so i know how it is and i hear you and i hear other guests talk about
[3:08:50.800 --> 3:08:57.760]  how we're going to win well i want to know what you mean when you say we're going to win or we
[3:08:57.760 --> 3:09:03.760]  can win this tell me what you mean by that that's a great question david we're going to win our
[3:09:03.760 --> 3:09:08.800]  souls we're going to stand up against evil and not cop out and say we're going to be teleported by
[3:09:08.800 --> 3:09:18.080]  scotty in the in the rapture that's not existent in the bible um until after and we're going to
[3:09:18.080 --> 3:09:26.400]  stand against evil and be tested in the fire and in the end good is going to win and so i don't get
[3:09:26.400 --> 3:09:32.480]  up here in debate theology i've read the bible i've studied it i know what it says i know it says
[3:09:32.480 --> 3:09:36.400]  the beast will make war on the saints and overcome them but that means the saints are going to fight
[3:09:36.400 --> 3:09:44.320]  it but in the greatest awakening to this dehumanizing force that's what it is it's death and disease
[3:09:44.320 --> 3:09:51.360]  and pain that's beautiful to satan and satan is a spirit it is real uh there is a mystery of evil
[3:09:51.360 --> 3:09:59.200]  as the bible talks about guiding this force and um i could feel that i could feel the good i could
[3:09:59.200 --> 3:10:07.280]  feel the evil and uh i so the cop out that i see from the false christianoid plastic fake
[3:10:07.280 --> 3:10:13.440]  mannequin church that isn't real it's like a mannequin of a man or woman it's not a human um
[3:10:17.760 --> 3:10:25.600]  i mean the reason i know the bible is is is is profound inspired by the creator is that people
[3:10:25.600 --> 3:10:32.160]  talk about nostradamus they're they're they're incredibly vague the king will be struck on the
[3:10:32.160 --> 3:10:39.280]  horse and the spear will go in his eye will kings back then fought in wars and that that was one
[3:10:39.280 --> 3:10:43.920]  of the most common ways they were killed was someone with a sword or a spear an arrow through the
[3:10:43.920 --> 3:10:48.000]  visor it's one of the few places they could they would be in heavy battle armor would take a crane
[3:10:48.640 --> 3:10:53.520]  to put them on the giant warhorse the big clidesdale uh i mean that's how you'd know the king
[3:10:53.520 --> 3:10:58.800]  because they would have the heaviest armor and and and and so oh my gosh his quad train you know
[3:10:58.800 --> 3:11:06.000]  100 years later uh the king of uh france was killed jousting that you know the the the the
[3:11:06.000 --> 3:11:15.200]  jousting spear went into his visor i mean that's not prophecy you read ezekiel and daniel and
[3:11:15.200 --> 3:11:24.720]  revelations and it is uh giant metal insects dropping eggs that are you know that turn into
[3:11:24.720 --> 3:11:30.800]  giant pillars of fire i mean that's that's nukes it is it is a world system where the image of the
[3:11:30.800 --> 3:11:36.800]  beast is seen by all television and and and that there's moving images of the beast on the streets
[3:11:36.800 --> 3:11:42.960]  and it describes holograms and robots and how you must buy or sell and it's the hand or the face the
[3:11:42.960 --> 3:11:47.360]  body scan they're now scanning you in these scanners to get your full biometric scan where
[3:11:47.360 --> 3:11:51.040]  they can passively not just in airports but from the street know who you are even if you
[3:11:51.040 --> 3:11:56.320]  are a mask shoots through your clothes and and and has the digital let you with understanding
[3:11:56.320 --> 3:12:01.440]  reckon the number it is a number of a man the digital calculation of a man's body of your
[3:12:02.000 --> 3:12:09.680]  of your face of your hand and it just goes on and on and on and on and on and on and how there
[3:12:09.680 --> 3:12:13.520]  will be 10 kingdoms and how there will be and then you read the club of rome and you in it the
[3:12:13.520 --> 3:12:19.200]  un calls it 10 kingdoms and it will be ruled by a monetary system and it will be a false church
[3:12:19.200 --> 3:12:31.280]  and it's just it's it's it's it's unbelievable and you can't read revelation and and those visions
[3:12:31.280 --> 3:12:37.040]  on the Isle of Patmos and not I mean it's not vague it's not vague and it says the merchants
[3:12:37.040 --> 3:12:41.680]  of the world traffic and men's souls that's what they're really into is control the mind
[3:12:41.680 --> 3:12:46.560]  what O'Brien is saying to Winston the mind is everything the soul what people believe
[3:12:46.560 --> 3:12:56.400]  and it just goes on and on and on so I'm just here to tell people what's happening and what the
[3:12:56.400 --> 3:13:02.880]  new order is doing and I have found that Bible thumping pushy Christians can't wake up anybody
[3:13:02.880 --> 3:13:09.920]  but I this radio show has so many people have not found the organized religion in the churches
[3:13:09.920 --> 3:13:14.560]  but they have found a relationship with the creator and their heart is right and they now
[3:13:14.560 --> 3:13:22.880]  understand it are getting themselves ready ready for what we're going into and I just want to try
[3:13:22.880 --> 3:13:30.880]  to be a pure and virtuous person I want to try to transcend my flesh and and and and and be the
[3:13:30.880 --> 3:13:40.160]  true leader that we're all meant to be and and and because as a symbol of liberty this radio
[3:13:40.160 --> 3:13:46.960]  show my films my myself the enemy takes what I do and distorts it and twisted and there's countless
[3:13:46.960 --> 3:13:53.120]  audios on the web where they spend weeks taking all these interviews and and all these things I say
[3:13:53.120 --> 3:13:58.800]  and cutting it together where it sounds you know it just so much stuff they do because they understand
[3:13:58.800 --> 3:14:01.840]  and they don't want people to realize there are good people they don't people to realize there
[3:14:01.840 --> 3:14:06.160]  are good leaders they don't people to realize because then a leader then reflects on you and
[3:14:06.160 --> 3:14:10.320]  you become a leader they don't want you to believe there's anything real anything bonafide there's
[3:14:10.320 --> 3:14:18.240]  just more evil and so it's just incredible I mean I feel the spirit of the creator and it is braces
[3:14:18.240 --> 3:14:26.640]  me with chills as the creator says you know you've done well but now you truly know more than you
[3:14:26.640 --> 3:14:31.200]  did before now you have the discernment now you have the knowledge there's no excuse you have
[3:14:31.200 --> 3:14:41.680]  to be even better and and then I say why me God why why am I in this position why why why have I
[3:14:41.680 --> 3:14:48.400]  been given this burden you know they say with great wisdom comes great sorrow why why and then why
[3:14:48.400 --> 3:14:56.240]  can't I articulate and and teach what I know and understand and the answer is at a certain level
[3:14:56.240 --> 3:15:01.680]  you know some are not even meant to understand what I'm saying some can't even understand it
[3:15:01.680 --> 3:15:07.440]  right now because they've hardened their hearts my heart gets softer and softer and bigger and
[3:15:07.440 --> 3:15:14.240]  it's full of more love and it just I don't even know how to describe it and I just I just want the
[3:15:14.240 --> 3:15:22.480]  evil to stop I want the the the hurting of the little ones to stop I mean do you understand
[3:15:22.480 --> 3:15:27.280]  what I'm saying David yeah I understand and then and you know that's the whole thing that Jesus
[3:15:27.280 --> 3:15:32.400]  talked about that there would be a day when all that stops and the reason that it exists
[3:15:32.400 --> 3:15:37.360]  is because of the fact that the people who are empowered now are under the influence of the
[3:15:37.360 --> 3:15:43.040]  original rebel as described in Solomon's book the way he dedicated that book to the original
[3:15:43.040 --> 3:15:47.280]  rebel Satan and then had the nerve to say at least he got his own kingdom out of the deal
[3:15:47.280 --> 3:15:55.840]  well the thing about it is this is turning out to be you know the kingdom of satan okay so there's
[3:15:55.840 --> 3:16:02.400]  no doubt I mean even if people don't believe in in in the old serpent as an entity collectively
[3:16:02.400 --> 3:16:08.880]  what's being manifested and what the elite are turning us into is hell the thing about it is
[3:16:08.880 --> 3:16:12.880]  Alex you know you mentioned earlier and I saw I was watching the program because I get the
[3:16:12.880 --> 3:16:21.200]  simulcast and all that and I was watching where Mr. Dice was doing the interviews yesterday well
[3:16:21.200 --> 3:16:27.760]  the thing about that is that every human being has been infected with a lie we believe a lie
[3:16:27.760 --> 3:16:33.200]  that's why these people come across as though they're God because the original live is the
[3:16:33.200 --> 3:16:41.040]  human race believed was that you can be God so they still believe that yeah they think they're
[3:16:41.040 --> 3:16:47.520]  God they you're talking about at the Capitol he's literally 60 70 yards away from cops where they
[3:16:47.520 --> 3:16:51.600]  said the media could be and then he marches up and just gets in his face and is looking at Aaron
[3:16:51.600 --> 3:16:58.720]  like he wants to kill him wow have you seen that video no I haven't seen that part but I'm talking
[3:16:58.720 --> 3:17:05.600]  about uh where where yesterday on your program you gave a snippet of uh I think it was dice
[3:17:05.600 --> 3:17:12.800]  and dies I thought you said Aaron Dykes yeah no no no no exactly those people want to play God
[3:17:12.800 --> 3:17:19.120]  they said they enjoyed the power trip of yes I want to ban criticism of Obama yes I want to sign
[3:17:19.120 --> 3:17:24.960]  the petition yes they were feeling like they were going to shut someone up and exactly I mean you
[3:17:24.960 --> 3:17:32.320]  know everybody has that everybody has that now before I was awakened and I can't say that I woke
[3:17:32.320 --> 3:17:39.040]  up I was awakened okay I had similar view not the totalitarian type of thing where if you
[3:17:39.040 --> 3:17:43.520]  defend against this view you need to shut up no but the thing about it is I had this gain
[3:17:43.520 --> 3:17:48.880]  for people who didn't think as I thought and and now whereas now I mean you know the whole left
[3:17:48.880 --> 3:17:54.080]  right thing has been shattered for me I mean totally just blown the smithereens every talk show that I
[3:17:54.080 --> 3:17:59.200]  get to call into and I'm a truck driver so I get to listen all day so every show that I call into
[3:17:59.200 --> 3:18:04.000]  the first thing is you talk you're coming at this from the wrong perspective there is no left right
[3:18:04.000 --> 3:18:10.400]  there are one um so you know but if I've done one thing if I've done one thing David
[3:18:12.480 --> 3:18:17.440]  is I coined the left right paradigm term I've hammered it for 14 years really about 12s when
[3:18:17.440 --> 3:18:24.560]  I really woke up to that fully for about 12 years and now people go wait I've been kept in this
[3:18:24.560 --> 3:18:31.200]  little box there's a whole another system and then a system to that system and I only go far as far
[3:18:31.200 --> 3:18:37.840]  out as I can prove in the paradigm but I'm now beginning to see even into the next level and
[3:18:37.840 --> 3:18:46.000]  let me tell you it is this whole reality is a fraud brother I gotta tell you the first time I saw
[3:18:46.000 --> 3:18:53.200]  the Obama deception I stayed up I saw it I somehow with some vision revisited or something website
[3:18:53.200 --> 3:19:00.720]  that I clicked on to and then it led me to the Obama deception and I could not sleep
[3:19:02.000 --> 3:19:05.760]  it was about a year ago right about as it was like the first or second week of February or
[3:19:05.760 --> 3:19:10.480]  third week of February somewhere around there somewhere around that area uh where shortly
[3:19:10.480 --> 3:19:16.480]  after the movie first came out and um I couldn't sleep and and I was up for like two days straight
[3:19:16.480 --> 3:19:22.000]  I'm like and I'm just devouring all of the information that's coming and putting things
[3:19:22.000 --> 3:19:28.560]  together and I'm like wow this thing is crazy hard you know when I found out about 10 when I
[3:19:28.560 --> 3:19:33.920]  found out about eight nine years ago that the eugenics was absolutely real going on worse than I
[3:19:33.920 --> 3:19:40.480]  thought I actually threw up I actually my mouth started watering and it was like a you know a
[3:19:40.480 --> 3:19:47.120]  the spiritual thing a physical manifestation of my soul was just like when I realized because my
[3:19:47.120 --> 3:19:53.040]  body my soul my subconscious already knew all this information at a base level but it was the
[3:19:53.040 --> 3:19:58.240]  conscious binding of that and and realizing it and the images of the children they're murdering

[3:24:25.040 --> 3:24:31.840]  the most painful things in my life is knowing that with my listeners we've woken up tens of millions
[3:24:31.840 --> 3:24:37.280]  of people and to see the system not just glenbeck and others at the top but lower down groups that
[3:24:37.280 --> 3:24:42.480]  co-opt it co-opt all the work we've done and then turn it into something nasty with their
[3:24:42.480 --> 3:24:47.760]  co-intel pro tricks most the idiots dancing to the tune in the string don't even know they're
[3:24:47.760 --> 3:24:53.840]  doing it but again that's going to happen if i mean if you wake people up that they're being
[3:24:53.840 --> 3:24:58.000]  lied to that doesn't necessarily mean that they're not going to be lied to at other levels that
[3:24:58.000 --> 3:25:03.200]  does it so you can't look at other people failing other people falling other people's problems all
[3:25:03.200 --> 3:25:09.600]  the nastiness and get wrapped up in it you've just got to continue to love god and love what's true
[3:25:09.600 --> 3:25:15.120]  and love honor and love beauty and love decency and love innocence and stand up against the new
[3:25:15.120 --> 3:25:19.840]  world order and give the people an alternative to say this is your enemy the new world order look
[3:25:19.840 --> 3:25:24.240]  what they've done to you look what the other opportunities could be look at what history is
[3:25:24.240 --> 3:25:34.320]  shown chris in florida you're on the air welcome alex is your life to revamp and and i respect
[3:25:34.320 --> 3:25:41.360]  your your life choices but when it comes down to your your life your own life and and your empathy
[3:25:41.360 --> 3:25:47.120]  for the lives of others it's really i think it's obvious from your your predictions coming true that
[3:25:47.120 --> 3:25:53.440]  you do have a greater forethought to see how the how the thoughts and the actions that we're sewing
[3:25:53.440 --> 3:25:59.760]  will soon be reaped and and because you do you have assumed that that sense of duty and loyalty
[3:25:59.760 --> 3:26:04.960]  and and the risk um that might have otherwise been assumed by others uh that that's what i think
[3:26:04.960 --> 3:26:10.320]  makes you most more christlike and uh if you were to decide to become less prominent in the media
[3:26:11.040 --> 3:26:17.120]  it's your sense of concern that would still bring you these greater insights and even deeper
[3:26:17.120 --> 3:26:21.920]  connection with god but no matter what you choose god works through everyone and oh no that's no one
[3:26:21.920 --> 3:26:25.440]  earlier i was saying i just miss not being able to see my grandmother or spend as much time with
[3:26:25.440 --> 3:26:30.960]  my kids so i feel like my time is stolen by having to fight this it's not like it's some
[3:26:30.960 --> 3:26:36.400]  delicious pleasure you know 10 years ago it was kind of the worldly triumph of defeating them
[3:26:36.400 --> 3:26:40.000]  and i still get happy when we have victories that's not bad it's just that
[3:26:40.880 --> 3:26:46.240]  that now i just i mean it's like whoa i know too much i mean it just gets deeper and deeper and
[3:26:46.240 --> 3:26:54.560]  deeper and the understanding it just accelerates to the point of like i'm saying god you know whatever
[3:26:54.560 --> 3:27:00.480]  you want me to do i'm gonna do but this is really hard to handle well it never ends
[3:27:00.480 --> 3:27:05.920]  and uh and when it comes to a reverend uh james david manning i wanted to speak with him and ask
[3:27:05.920 --> 3:27:10.880]  him to say he had the right to say that obama ought to be tried for treason i agree that barack is
[3:27:10.880 --> 3:27:16.240]  the butcher but uh he's also an unindicted war criminal and his treasonous he's illegitimate
[3:27:16.240 --> 3:27:23.440]  by virtue of his lies and and the constitution but uh to anybody who who seeks the death penalty i
[3:27:23.440 --> 3:27:28.720]  just ask would you cast the first stone would you pull the switch would you open the trap door
[3:27:28.720 --> 3:27:36.640]  below the news and uh as punishment for for such a work criminal as i would only suggest isolation
[3:27:36.640 --> 3:27:41.840]  from power sequestering from society well yeah here's the danger of the death penalty i mean if
[3:27:41.840 --> 3:27:47.040]  you're in a in a village five thousand years ago and somebody kills your kid the village is going
[3:27:47.040 --> 3:27:50.240]  to grab the person that was seen doing it and they're going to kill them and that's that's a good
[3:27:50.240 --> 3:27:56.880]  thing the problem is that government is always so much more evil than just the individual criminal
[3:27:56.880 --> 3:28:02.640]  and we know more than a third of people on death row are innocent from dna and we know the government
[3:28:02.640 --> 3:28:07.040]  does frame people and we know they now torture people for confessions and are saying that's
[3:28:07.040 --> 3:28:12.000]  admissible in court now as they set the precedence with the with the trials coming up in new york
[3:28:12.000 --> 3:28:20.560]  and so the government can't be trusted to carry out the death penalty because it's it's it's it's
[3:28:20.560 --> 3:28:28.240]  it is the evil and so that's my problem but but then at an instinctive level when i see them catch
[3:28:28.240 --> 3:28:32.800]  some person that you know kidnap 10 or 15 women and torture them to death and they admit to it i
[3:28:32.800 --> 3:28:38.240]  say kill them i mean you know but but at the same time that means they're also going to kill a bunch
[3:28:38.240 --> 3:28:43.600]  of innocent people and i and and it's better that 100 guilty men go free than one innocent man be
[3:28:43.600 --> 3:28:50.880]  killed so um i mean you see the point i'm making well absolutely but i wouldn't even be more
[3:28:50.880 --> 3:28:55.680]  gratifying and and constructive to offer amnesty to encourage them to sing like a bird i mean that
[3:28:55.680 --> 3:29:01.040]  would be a lot more constructive than putting them to death and these puppets like obama are ill
[3:29:01.040 --> 3:29:06.960]  and that they do embrace the concept that their masters consider them expendable the last thing
[3:29:06.960 --> 3:29:14.480]  i want for the cynical despotic dictators to see him or her and my own belief to see them reincarnate
[3:29:14.480 --> 3:29:21.280]  and i care forever in manning's soul in that respect as well but there are so many more
[3:29:21.280 --> 3:29:27.040]  constructive things that could be done with with such taters i also wanted to bring up
[3:29:27.040 --> 3:29:35.840]  what was brought up at the end of the show yesterday by angel about gmo produce and you said that if
[3:29:35.840 --> 3:29:40.560]  you just wash off the produce uh when it comes to the pesticides you know you want to get organic
[3:29:40.560 --> 3:29:47.360]  of course and and even when i wash off my organic produce i'm finding with water from my i hear you
[3:29:47.360 --> 3:29:54.480]  but i gotta jump call me back again i got a guest coming in we're on the march the empires on the
[3:29:54.480 --> 3:30:03.440]  run alex jones and the gcn radio network this is alex jones with five good reasons you should
[3:30:03.440 --> 3:30:08.720]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[3:30:08.720 --> 3:30:13.840]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[3:30:13.840 --> 3:30:19.120]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[3:30:19.120 --> 3:30:24.400]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[3:30:24.400 --> 3:30:29.680]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[3:30:29.680 --> 3:30:34.800]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[3:30:34.800 --> 3:30:39.360]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[3:30:39.360 --> 3:30:43.920]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators

[3:33:25.840 --> 3:33:30.320]  building the tv studio finally got the permits and that's ongoing now you may even hear a lot
[3:33:30.320 --> 3:33:32.960]  of banging and stuff i know what we're going to do because they're going to be working
[3:33:32.960 --> 3:33:37.840]  12 hours a day uh even though it's about 30 yards away where they're building it
[3:33:38.960 --> 3:33:45.920]  or more it's about 40 yards but uh we need your support now more than ever our audience
[3:33:45.920 --> 3:33:51.600]  doubled on radio internet more than doubled last year last three months on the election ratings
[3:33:51.600 --> 3:33:56.320]  were up almost 50 percent so we're exponentially growing but i can tell you the economy's falling
[3:33:56.320 --> 3:34:02.160]  apart over the years we could pretty much gauge as listed ship and numbers went up the profit
[3:34:02.160 --> 3:34:08.640]  coming in the revenue to fund our operation would go up right online with it until about 2007
[3:34:09.520 --> 3:34:16.640]  and thank god from media operation in the info war we have just expanded and expanded and expanded
[3:34:16.640 --> 3:34:21.120]  and expanded and kind of like escaped the black hole that's sucking all the other media in going
[3:34:21.120 --> 3:34:25.280]  bankrupt and we're almost like in the new episode of a star trek where they're getting out of the
[3:34:25.280 --> 3:34:29.920]  black hole and they're barely making it i mean we're just you know we're pulling away but that
[3:34:29.920 --> 3:34:36.160]  black hole is growing even faster and so again we're trying to expand in the face of the new
[3:34:36.160 --> 3:34:46.080]  world order we're trying to expand in the face of all of this corruption and so i again um
[3:34:48.000 --> 3:34:52.000]  we're trying to take it up a notch here we're trying to intensify and you do that by supporting
[3:34:52.000 --> 3:34:57.280]  us buying the books dvds the patriot t-shirts and material and i want to thank everybody who has
[3:34:57.280 --> 3:35:01.520]  been supporting us that rally last night i'd say over 80 percent of the people that were wearing
[3:35:01.520 --> 3:35:07.920]  info wars dot com shirts joker shirts it was my listeners that came out um you think the other
[3:35:07.920 --> 3:35:14.080]  gun community in austin could we would muster more than the 300 i got out there uh but and our
[3:35:14.080 --> 3:35:19.200]  listeners got out there but i'm just glad a caller called me not this sunday but the sunday before i
[3:35:19.200 --> 3:35:23.520]  guess like nine days ago to even let me know that happened at the gun show and i when we found out it
[3:35:23.520 --> 3:35:28.480]  was true uh so we're now aware of that it's now a national a national issue but again info wars
[3:35:28.480 --> 3:35:34.240]  dot com the online video bookstore or prison planet dot tv 595 a month watch the show live all the
[3:35:34.240 --> 3:35:38.880]  films are there in high quality uh richard reeve i want to get into deborah medina but i want to
[3:35:38.880 --> 3:35:43.840]  just go back i got an email saturday morning saying rick perry is going to be at red's indoor range
[3:35:43.840 --> 3:35:50.160]  and it wasn't official so i and that was my one day that one day i tried to spend the whole day
[3:35:50.160 --> 3:35:54.640]  with my children playing football and watching them on the scooters and and uh you know walking
[3:35:54.640 --> 3:35:59.120]  in the woods and all that and painting with them and stuff so i just ignored it uh but i should
[3:35:59.120 --> 3:36:03.520]  have gone down there and talked to him but i'm glad you did and richard you just always do great
[3:36:03.520 --> 3:36:08.400]  work you did great work with us on the obama deception and on uh fall the republic with a
[3:36:08.400 --> 3:36:13.040]  great camera work you did and uh just a side issue you know the new york times and others said
[3:36:13.040 --> 3:36:16.720]  that there wasn't even a bill de berger at meeting we were imagining cars following us an
[3:36:16.720 --> 3:36:21.040]  imagining secret service so you you were there briefly uh what happened oh absolutely well
[3:36:21.040 --> 3:36:25.280]  i was at the uh chantilly virginia event with you guys with uh we all did the work together and i
[3:36:25.280 --> 3:36:30.320]  was there shooting video and there was definitely a bill de berger event going on there and as many
[3:36:30.320 --> 3:36:35.200]  people know uh obama and hillary were potentially there inside the bill de berger event i'm sure
[3:36:35.200 --> 3:36:39.920]  they were it's been later confirmed that's right they were missing at the time so there was definitely
[3:36:39.920 --> 3:36:44.800]  a bill de berger event there in chantilly virginia and i was there to witness and document that with
[3:36:44.800 --> 3:36:50.400]  you that was a great honor to do that but that's another two plus two equals five where where the
[3:36:50.400 --> 3:36:55.840]  media just says we just imagined it all oh well we were all having a mass hallucination i'm here
[3:36:55.840 --> 3:36:59.760]  to tell you it was not an imagined event just like that fire alarm that happened around midnight
[3:36:59.760 --> 3:37:03.440]  you know when you're going on coast to coast there at the hotel i mean that wasn't imagined and
[3:37:03.440 --> 3:37:07.600]  remember i came back to the hotel room and me and rob said they just told us about don't pull
[3:37:07.600 --> 3:37:13.360]  fire alarms that's right that's right uh and and and then and then i told and those guys even though
[3:37:13.360 --> 3:37:18.080]  i just told them that they the camera crew still couldn't believe it right right so i mean we could
[3:37:18.080 --> 3:37:22.080]  really uh go back and cover a lot of history that we've done together you know we went to dallas and
[3:37:22.080 --> 3:37:27.760]  did the some jfk shooting uh up there to document that and then chantilly virginia bill de berger
[3:37:27.760 --> 3:37:32.560]  event and uh then you were in canada i wasn't on that trip with you guys up in canada when y'all
[3:37:32.560 --> 3:37:36.720]  got held at the border and everything like that so it's just been quite a saga that we've all kind
[3:37:36.720 --> 3:37:42.240]  of uh lived together here and i've as a listener i've uh gotten to uh have a front row seat to most
[3:37:42.240 --> 3:37:47.200]  of it with you going on and i look forward to a lot more i think the mainstream media is sabotaging
[3:37:47.200 --> 3:37:52.800]  themselves though by engaging in hoaxes with the flu and the north american union and the spp and uh
[3:37:52.800 --> 3:37:58.160]  the uh copenhagen denying it while it's all being set up i and saying there's no mercury in the
[3:37:58.160 --> 3:38:02.640]  shots when i mean it's really discrediting them well absolutely and that's one thing i do constantly
[3:38:02.640 --> 3:38:07.280]  on some of the programs that i do is i say look mainstream media just keep it up keep up your
[3:38:07.280 --> 3:38:12.560]  lives keep up your own missions keep up your provocations and we're going to just obsolete you
[3:38:12.560 --> 3:38:17.600]  it's going to be shows like yours on gcn live and your info wars program it's going to be shows like
[3:38:17.600 --> 3:38:21.680]  yours are going to dominate that's happening already you were talking about how the newspapers
[3:38:21.680 --> 3:38:26.960]  are going into the black hole the black abyss of uh non profitability uh as a matter of fact they've
[3:38:26.960 --> 3:38:31.600]  literally shrunk in size now they're actually smaller than they used to be not only in thickness
[3:38:31.600 --> 3:38:36.160]  but also in width so that's what we're doing is we're taking the mainstream media down and we'll
[3:38:36.160 --> 3:38:40.640]  continue to do that with alternative radio programs and internet shows like yours and that's where the
[3:38:40.640 --> 3:38:44.080]  mainstream media they're either gonna have to we're gonna have to drag them along and in some
[3:38:44.080 --> 3:38:48.480]  case they are dragging being drug along and thankfully at least they're willing to at least
[3:38:48.480 --> 3:38:52.800]  report on some of this news to where we can go in and read between the lines and decide for what's
[3:38:52.800 --> 3:38:56.320]  going on in the world so i'll tell you briefly about the very successful protest last time
[3:38:56.320 --> 3:39:02.560]  i want to thank everybody for coming out there it was great meeting folks um i believe it's the same
[3:39:03.920 --> 3:39:08.400]  cbs black reporter i mean it it i i forgot his name but he looked like the guy who was in the
[3:39:08.400 --> 3:39:13.760]  earlier cbs reports reading what the police told him that that it is illegal to have private sales
[3:39:13.760 --> 3:39:17.360]  and i showed him the law and he said well look don't get mad at us we just reported what the
[3:39:17.360 --> 3:39:22.160]  police told us but and then they did the right thing actually after i showed him the law
[3:39:22.160 --> 3:39:27.600]  actually put it on the news and it was a 90 accurate report set of 100 percent a baloney
[3:39:28.320 --> 3:39:34.400]  and the the other newscast were pretty fair so the fact is and it got their attention when i bullhorned
[3:39:34.400 --> 3:39:40.240]  them and said how dare you you know and people don't understand when you kiss up to them and go along
[3:39:40.240 --> 3:39:45.040]  with it it doesn't work you've got it when you're in the right you got to say you are wrong and here's
[3:39:45.040 --> 3:39:50.720]  the facts and so that's a great victory well it does take somebody calling them out on their actions
[3:39:50.720 --> 3:39:54.240]  we have to that's just like with this rick perry clip that uh hopefully was showing a little bit
[3:39:54.240 --> 3:39:58.960]  where i caught up with the reds indoor range i got word of it friday from robert morrow friend of mine
[3:39:58.960 --> 3:40:04.000]  said rick perry's going to be a reds indoor range on friday afternoon we went up there and a bunch
[3:40:04.000 --> 3:40:09.120]  of showed up it was a cadre of patris that were there and we waited two hours i want to thank val
[3:40:09.120 --> 3:40:13.120]  and rita because val is the one that shot the video himself and rita was there as well his wife
[3:40:13.680 --> 3:40:19.520]  and we waited two hours to get that one minute of video uh because they wouldn't allow us inside
[3:40:19.520 --> 3:40:24.960]  the store to try to get this testimony out of rick perry to get his standing on where he stood on
[3:40:24.960 --> 3:40:30.160]  this uh gun show being closed down so anyway we waited there patiently we finally got him
[3:40:30.160 --> 3:40:34.720]  and as you saw i only had less than a minute there before he's got a minute of 11 seconds before he
[3:40:34.720 --> 3:40:39.840]  says i got to go and not only that his bodyguard or eight or whoever it was actually physically
[3:40:39.840 --> 3:40:44.400]  grabs him and pulls him away and i'm still there wanting to ask questions and continue the conversation
[3:40:44.400 --> 3:40:48.880]  but at least we got him on record my goal was to get him on record say hey rick perry where do
[3:40:48.880 --> 3:40:52.720]  you stand on this issue of the gun show being closed down and he waffled at first but at the end
[3:40:52.720 --> 3:40:56.880]  he said no my understanding is your understanding right sure that this was intimidation that this
[3:40:56.880 --> 3:41:01.520]  was harassment that this was uh you know a lot of things and that and that they're looking into it
[3:41:01.520 --> 3:41:06.800]  so now it is on record because it's this illusion of the austin police chief and the bat fe and the
[3:41:06.800 --> 3:41:11.200]  government saying no this is what we did and and and you know that's our story we're sticking to
[3:41:11.200 --> 3:41:14.720]  it now the governor's saying hey this is wrong but i want to talk about who we hope our next
[3:41:14.720 --> 3:41:20.000]  governor is going to be deba madina in a moment but let's go ahead and play this rick perry clip
[3:41:20.000 --> 3:41:24.640]  right now here's the video and audio with that this is reds into a range hi i'm richard i had at
[3:41:24.640 --> 3:41:30.000]  least one more question about the gun show issue is robert explained earlier my understanding is
[3:41:30.000 --> 3:41:33.760]  is that the gun show owner has not voluntarily given up his gun show what has happened to
[3:41:33.760 --> 3:41:40.640]  evidently is a combination of apd and or bat fe has gone and talked to the landlord of the building
[3:41:40.640 --> 3:41:45.600]  okay it's supposed to be h e b right and that h e b has come to the gun show owner said hey your
[3:41:45.600 --> 3:41:50.400]  gun show is off you're done and my understanding is that the gun show has done nothing wrong if they've
[3:41:50.400 --> 3:41:56.240]  been uh convicted over or anything like that that's my understanding too and and my advice is find
[3:41:56.240 --> 3:42:01.600]  another venue and find another venue sure is it okay that the feds come in and pressure a
[3:42:01.600 --> 3:42:06.560]  landlord like that i don't think that's fine at all my deal is though until we get that all cleared
[3:42:06.560 --> 3:42:10.400]  up because i mean there's a lot of he said she said here that i don't know what the facts are
[3:42:10.400 --> 3:42:16.480]  right but if if the if the issue is h e b won't let you have that site i'll bet you there's somebody
[3:42:16.480 --> 3:42:21.840]  in this city that would barely love to say well i agree that's true here's what here's what and then
[3:42:21.840 --> 3:42:26.800]  go forward if they try it again at that particular point in time i'm not a lawyer but i gotta start
[3:42:26.800 --> 3:42:30.240]  saying that harassment's getting into play here well i gotta go through that we gotta make it
[3:42:32.720 --> 3:42:37.840]  boom so they they they they drag him off that's right but definitely this is drawn national
[3:42:37.840 --> 3:42:42.240]  attention they've now admitted the justice department came in and told the police department
[3:42:42.240 --> 3:42:47.200]  to do this they ran the last gun show off they now just shut this one down and they've been caught
[3:42:47.200 --> 3:42:51.360]  telling different stories now there aren't a lot of trouble if people force the issue well i look
[3:42:51.360 --> 3:42:56.720]  forward to our gun show in austin being secured in perpetuity uh you know right here in austin
[3:42:56.720 --> 3:43:00.560]  because of this event i think we're really going to be victorious on that we had the big rally
[3:43:00.560 --> 3:43:06.080]  yesterday that got the word out you had the press reporting on it 90 honest manner there
[3:43:06.080 --> 3:43:11.600]  we've got rick perry here now think about this it's a month and a week before a primary election
[3:43:11.600 --> 3:43:16.480]  here in texas the governor's race is a contested race regardless of what anybody says rick perry
[3:43:16.480 --> 3:43:20.320]  you think at least he'd be grandstanding on this gun show issue and say oh yeah i'm going to look
[3:43:20.320 --> 3:43:24.720]  into this i'm going to take charge we're going to see to it that the feds aren't down here interfering
[3:43:24.720 --> 3:43:30.880]  in our gun rights and our second amendment rights he's so so sold out that he doesn't even do that
[3:43:30.880 --> 3:43:36.080]  and here a month and a week away from a primary so imagine folks if he gets in to the governorship
[3:43:36.080 --> 3:43:42.320]  once again and just continues on with the bill de berg new world order agenda 21 agendas just moving
[3:43:42.320 --> 3:43:47.040]  forward in the uh police state i mean he's just going along with right with every globalist program
[3:43:47.040 --> 3:43:51.680]  that they point our way and he has definitely not stood up to the feds he's definitely not stood up
[3:43:51.680 --> 3:43:56.480]  four states rights tenth amendment rights we've pressed him we had a big nullification rally
[3:43:56.480 --> 3:44:03.120]  only a week before that and at that nullification rally we're asking rick perry to stand up for
[3:44:03.120 --> 3:44:07.360]  the states rights tenth amendment rights that's not happening either and here we are like to say
[3:44:07.360 --> 3:44:13.760]  once again in a hotly contested republican primary race for governor and where is he on these issues
[3:44:13.760 --> 3:44:21.200]  silent well here's the good news again though uh deborah medina unknown a few months ago um
[3:44:21.920 --> 3:44:26.080]  comes on this radio show some other bigger radio shows gets the ron paul movement behind her
[3:44:26.080 --> 3:44:33.200]  she's a you know ron paul died in the wall in the feather uh and she goes into that debate and her
[3:44:33.200 --> 3:44:38.480]  numbers quadruple she's now if we had a few more months to be guaranteed to win but but you know
[3:44:38.480 --> 3:44:43.840]  it's that race but it sends a message whether she wins or loses she wins because now all these other
[3:44:43.840 --> 3:44:49.040]  candidates and governors races and legislative races at the state houses and federal races in
[3:44:49.040 --> 3:44:55.200]  congress house and senate and on top of what's happened in massachusetts with brown the message is
[3:44:55.200 --> 3:45:00.960]  the people want change and not just on the democrat side with republicans they want real
[3:45:02.640 --> 3:45:07.920]  paleo conservative constitutionalist property rights second amendment national sovereignty
[3:45:07.920 --> 3:45:13.360]  in the fed deborah medina uh i mean this is sending shockwaves across the country i talked to
[3:45:13.360 --> 3:45:18.960]  national political pundits they are following deborah medina very very closely and so everybody
[3:45:18.960 --> 3:45:22.960]  else now is signing up to run and so we're going to get victories every time we stand up we win
[3:45:22.960 --> 3:45:28.880]  but uh they weren't going to put her in the next below debate even though uh she was she was tracking
[3:45:28.880 --> 3:45:33.360]  nicely uh they they they changed the rules to say you have to be of a comparable office you have
[3:45:33.360 --> 3:45:37.920]  to be a governor or senator to be in a debate that was obviously illegal the way they change so they
[3:45:37.920 --> 3:45:41.680]  said okay because it's quasi you know public private they say it's their private debate but
[3:45:41.680 --> 3:45:45.680]  it's a public service they're supposedly carrying out so their lawyers told them back off and they
[3:45:45.680 --> 3:45:50.960]  did back off within a week of our listeners and other listeners uh and the ron paul folks out
[3:45:50.960 --> 3:45:55.200]  there so we built that revolution with ron paul's another platform and it's another platform
[3:45:55.200 --> 3:46:00.560]  it's another platform in the movement the long view of history that uh that jebra griffin talks
[3:46:00.560 --> 3:46:05.920]  about so tell us about deborah medina okay well the website medina for texas dot com i'd encourage
[3:46:05.920 --> 3:46:10.640]  everybody to go there but here's the thing is i don't think deborah medina can win i don't believe
[3:46:10.640 --> 3:46:17.680]  deborah medina can win i know deborah medina can win here are the i agree with you if people don't
[3:46:17.680 --> 3:46:21.600]  like in the nfl pick the team and things kind of win that's right we need to get past that
[3:46:21.600 --> 3:46:26.240]  psychological mechanism well listen my grandmother did i don't know if you heard me talk about it
[3:46:26.240 --> 3:46:31.600]  earlier she doesn't really listen to the show very often it upsets her so and my and my mother was
[3:46:31.600 --> 3:46:36.880]  driving her around you know great grandmother to my kids and uh she was taking her to physical
[3:46:36.880 --> 3:46:41.920]  therapy last week and it was she sharp as a tack and my mother said uh who you're gonna vote for
[3:46:41.920 --> 3:46:48.960]  the republican primary she's a republican and she said uh oh medina uh because it everybody
[3:46:48.960 --> 3:46:53.120]  loved her talk radios on fire with her that's what's happening the best thing that happened to us
[3:46:53.120 --> 3:46:58.160]  is k r a trying to black her out of this debate it lit the fire behind the grassroots which is
[3:46:58.160 --> 3:47:04.960]  something we really needed to happen because folks we had 1.3 million voters in the 2006 election
[3:47:04.960 --> 3:47:11.280]  that voted independent 1.3 million voters that that cadre of folks right there is ready to vote
[3:47:11.280 --> 3:47:16.960]  out establishment candidates like rick perry if those people come into this primary they can win
[3:47:16.960 --> 3:47:24.080]  this race because guess what rick perry only had 550 000 votes in the 06 primary 550 000 votes
[3:47:24.080 --> 3:47:29.360]  is all he had he may very well split those votes with k bailey hutcheson k bailout hutcheson he
[3:47:29.360 --> 3:47:34.960]  may drop she will win if people come out and vote absolutely absolutely there's no doubt there'll be
[3:47:34.960 --> 3:47:39.360]  some election fraud but it's not in every county if we figuratively and literally just tap on our
[3:47:39.360 --> 3:47:43.760]  neighbor's shoulders and ask them hey at least are you registered to vote and tell them about demordina
[3:47:43.760 --> 3:47:47.760]  get a button go on the website the importance of that button right there alex i can't tell you every
[3:47:47.760 --> 3:47:52.400]  day people ask me about that who's deborah medina and they want to know they want to hear about it
[3:47:52.400 --> 3:47:58.240]  i'm convinced that after the 06 election was 1.3 million independent voters we had the ron paul
[3:47:58.240 --> 3:48:04.800]  revolution occur in 0708 i believe in my heart there are two million people in texas that are ready
[3:48:04.800 --> 3:48:10.480]  to press that electronic fraud button for demordina make it work though make that button work get your
[3:48:10.480 --> 3:48:15.680]  precincts out there get your precinct conventions going become precinct chairs and well regardless
[3:48:15.680 --> 3:48:20.880]  we win because with a strong showing and she may win with a strong showing you now have it moving
[3:48:20.880 --> 3:48:25.280]  to the states which is the real battle plan to beat the new world order the feds have been seized by
[3:48:25.280 --> 3:48:31.040]  offshore banks we we take the states back it's over that's right in texas can lead the way
[3:48:31.040 --> 3:48:34.960]  i would like it's just like copenhagen people said we couldn't beat it exactly you just have the
[3:48:34.960 --> 3:48:38.960]  will to win you got the truth on your side you can't be stopped alex right here this highway
[3:48:38.960 --> 3:48:43.840]  that goes by your office i'm encouraged every time i come by here because i fought the tolls on this
[3:48:43.840 --> 3:48:48.080]  road this was supposed to be a toll road by your office did you know that yes i knew that okay it was
[3:48:48.080 --> 3:48:52.960]  great activists here in austin area that fought that that's one of the victories every time i got
[3:48:52.960 --> 3:48:56.400]  i have the pleasure to drive by your office i think you know what we say that from being a
[3:48:56.400 --> 3:49:01.200]  toll road alex didn't have to pay a toll on the count of it so we were told back then it's a done
[3:49:01.200 --> 3:49:06.400]  deal there's no way to change it just give up just give up the like health care it's a done deal
[3:49:06.400 --> 3:49:10.400]  exactly it's not a done deal that's the classic play that they do it's the board you will be
[3:49:10.400 --> 3:49:15.280]  assimilated you will be assimilated and i'm here to tell you folks deborah deena can win this race
[3:49:15.280 --> 3:49:19.600]  will win this race if the people of texas just do their job i mean think about alex you've been on
[3:49:19.600 --> 3:49:25.200]  the air 14 plus years right yeah don't tell me there's not a half a million of us here in texas
[3:49:25.200 --> 3:49:30.880]  half a million gets us in a runoff if we get 700 000 or a million voters to vote deborah deena in
[3:49:30.880 --> 3:49:35.760]  this race then deborah deena will win this and you're not even hearing about democrats so if
[3:49:35.760 --> 3:49:39.600]  she wins this she's going to beat the democrats this is a republican state she will that's right
[3:49:39.600 --> 3:49:45.600]  this is a republican state and guess what the flip side is true as well if rick perry squirrels in to
[3:49:45.600 --> 3:49:50.720]  this primary victory or k bailout squirrels in then the democrat most likely is going to win
[3:49:50.720 --> 3:49:56.400]  well we may see as a bifurcation of the vote in the general election in 2010 where republican
[3:49:57.200 --> 3:50:02.400]  seats you know house seats state house seats state senate seats may we may see more republican
[3:50:02.400 --> 3:50:07.680]  victories but at the general state level we might see a democrat governor that's what could
[3:50:07.680 --> 3:50:13.280]  happen because people are are rebelling against incumbents bingo you know massachusetts they want
[3:50:13.280 --> 3:50:18.240]  the democrats out in texas they want the main line republicans out that's right they're uh
[3:50:18.240 --> 3:50:22.560]  rebelling against incumbents is exactly right this and say it's like we've got an organic
[3:50:22.560 --> 3:50:28.400]  ron paul revolution going on within us we've got steven shoppy running against uh lemar smith
[3:50:28.400 --> 3:50:32.560]  we've got joe patronus here in texas running against michael mccall how did ron paul endure
[3:50:32.560 --> 3:50:38.160]  smith well i have uh pretty good information that he didn't know about steven shoppy filing
[3:50:38.160 --> 3:50:43.360]  steven shoppy didn't file to the very last day of filing ron paul in my view was most likely
[3:50:43.360 --> 3:50:47.520]  unaware so it was the lesser of two eagles that's all it was is he was unaware about it and i'm sure
[3:50:47.520 --> 3:50:51.360]  that there's uh you know some sorrow there but nonetheless stay there we got a break final

[3:54:06.560 --> 3:54:14.160]  to her she's coming on thursday she is swamped from six in the morning until 11 at night she is
[3:54:14.160 --> 3:54:17.920]  doing interview after interview after interview after interview after interview after interview on
[3:54:17.920 --> 3:54:23.600]  talk radio newspapers and tv i mean she is the hottest thing since uh you know corvettes and
[3:54:23.600 --> 3:54:30.240]  blondes i mean i i i mean it is super super hot what's going on and again it shows that fervor
[3:54:30.240 --> 3:54:35.680]  fervor the other big problem is uh and she has raised what 300 and something thousand dollars
[3:54:36.880 --> 3:54:40.960]  right which for a statewide campaign here in texas that's nothing you've got rick perry and k
[3:54:40.960 --> 3:54:45.520]  bailey each having millions of dollars but still for a new dark horse candidate out of the middle
[3:54:45.520 --> 3:54:51.360]  of nowhere that is big uh now expanding on that you are worried as i am about glenbeck
[3:54:51.360 --> 3:54:58.640]  about sarah palin right they're clear positioning of her as a spoiler in in in 2012 explain that
[3:54:58.640 --> 3:55:02.960]  that's right well folks they are the new world order is positioning sarah palin as the presidential
[3:55:02.960 --> 3:55:07.760]  candidate for 2012 there's no doubt about that and right now she's a rhino she's just a product of
[3:55:07.760 --> 3:55:12.080]  the new world order propaganda but there's a chance she may become patreon who knows but i want to
[3:55:12.080 --> 3:55:18.080]  ask the info warriors out there in the tennessee area palin is supposed to be at a tea party convention
[3:55:18.080 --> 3:55:23.440]  a national tea party convention next weekend the first weekend in february i'd like for folks to
[3:55:23.440 --> 3:55:27.520]  get over there and call her out and say look sarah palin you're going to come to texas and
[3:55:27.520 --> 3:55:32.640]  endorse rick perry you need to stop that you need to not come to texas not do the photo ops with
[3:55:32.640 --> 3:55:37.680]  rick perry not do the big press endorsement of rick perry because your rognes at that point
[3:55:37.680 --> 3:55:43.520]  sarah palin your rognes is over there are going to be patriots nationwide saying look sarah palin
[3:55:43.520 --> 3:55:49.600]  we know you are not rogue and stop don't come down to texas if you're going to be perry perry he says
[3:55:49.600 --> 3:55:54.720]  he's got new jobs they're all government jobs we lost jobs right in the private sector perry goes
[3:55:54.720 --> 3:55:59.040]  to bill de berg cabily hutcheson is a steering committee member i mean that's highest level
[3:55:59.040 --> 3:56:08.640]  globalist i mean i mean perry vetoed until the heat got on him the legislature banning all the
[3:56:08.640 --> 3:56:13.520]  toll roads oh i know rick perry is still pushing the trans texas corridor he's still pushing
[3:56:13.520 --> 3:56:18.000]  nafty he's still pushing all these globalist agendas albeit more quietly but you know how
[3:56:18.000 --> 3:56:23.600]  you can really find out where rick perry stands are by his appointments he appointed ted houghton
[3:56:23.600 --> 3:56:30.320]  the one sole holdout vote that voted pro-centra on s h 121 up in douseforth area ted houghton
[3:56:30.320 --> 3:56:34.480]  was okay centra isn't owned by spain because louis black of the chronicle says so well there you go
[3:56:34.480 --> 3:56:38.800]  so i mean if you look at the appointments that rick perry makes then you'll know where he really
[3:56:38.800 --> 3:56:43.840]  stands and that's what i recommend that people do and ted houghton was a pro-centra vote back in
[3:56:43.840 --> 3:56:49.440]  summer vote seven on s h 121 now he's the chairman of the texas transportation commission
[3:56:49.440 --> 3:56:55.200]  and rick perry handpicked ted houghton as rick williamson's replacement when rick williamson
[3:56:55.200 --> 3:56:59.760]  passed away to sit on this texas transportation commission so that tells you right there are a
[3:56:59.760 --> 3:57:03.360]  lot of what you need to know about rick perry so rick if rick perry has his way he'd like to
[3:57:03.360 --> 3:57:08.560]  toll every road he's presided over the the new franchise tax it's really a an income tax you
[3:57:08.560 --> 3:57:12.960]  name it well we can talk about the garter sale thing that he tried to do slamming uh trying to
