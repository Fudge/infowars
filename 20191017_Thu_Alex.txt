[00:00.000 --> 00:04.740]  Gavin McInnis is back with his all-new online network, FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:04.740 --> 00:31.420]  Gavin McInnis, Joe Biggs, Miley Unopolis, and Sof, all at FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:31.420 --> 00:46.860]  Let me just take a deep breath and say this as calmly as I can.
[00:46.860 --> 00:51.180]  This morning, I woke up and my wife was highly agitated.
[00:51.180 --> 00:52.680]  She never is.
[00:52.680 --> 00:57.100]  She said, I've got a really bad feeling about today.
[00:57.100 --> 01:02.060]  She said, we really need to just come home early and watch the kids, and I said, what
[01:02.060 --> 01:03.060]  do you have a bad feeling about?
[01:03.060 --> 01:05.020]  She said, I don't know.
[01:05.020 --> 01:15.460]  I get to work, hit Daniels a couple hours ago, walks up to me, and he says, Alex, I've
[01:15.460 --> 01:20.980]  got a really bad feeling about today.
[01:20.980 --> 01:29.740]  I'm just going to talk about it next segment.
[01:29.740 --> 01:30.900]  I'm going to restart next segment.
[01:30.900 --> 01:34.620]  I have to do it, and that's just the best I can do.
[01:34.620 --> 01:38.260]  That's all I can do at this point.
[01:38.260 --> 01:42.660]  The headline's up on infowars.com, and I'm going to restart next segment, and I'm going
[01:42.660 --> 01:46.340]  to come in here and I'm going to cover all this live on this transmission for you.
[01:46.340 --> 01:50.380]  I'm going to go to a special report, though, here right now.
[01:50.380 --> 01:51.380]  We're getting a poll.
[01:51.380 --> 01:52.780]  Joseph Watson's report's very important.
[01:52.780 --> 01:58.820]  It's clip three, and that is the truth about the Extinction Rebellion, and then we come
[01:58.820 --> 01:59.820]  back.
[01:59.820 --> 02:03.380]  I'm going to cover the most important issue that you could possibly cover, period, because
[02:03.380 --> 02:06.140]  as we began to focus this morning, everybody was really concerned.
[02:06.140 --> 02:09.820]  No one knew why, because it was our subconscious brains more powerful than the conscious, and
[02:09.820 --> 02:16.220]  then it all just came into plain view for everyone here.
[02:16.220 --> 02:17.220]  So we're going to be doing that.
[02:17.220 --> 02:20.260]  We come back, breaking that down next segment.
[02:20.260 --> 02:23.220]  Just everyone you know to tune in right now, and believe me, this is vitally important
[02:23.220 --> 02:25.300]  beyond anything you can probably even imagine.
[02:25.300 --> 02:31.540]  We'll be laying it all out here in just a few minutes, but here's that report.
[02:31.540 --> 02:36.140]  When discussing climate change, it's important to focus on the hard data, and not just be
[02:36.140 --> 02:39.980]  tempted to laugh at the insane behavior of climate change activists.
[02:39.980 --> 02:44.420]  So I'm going to discuss hard data, but not before I laugh at the insane behavior of climate
[02:44.420 --> 02:45.420]  change activists.
[02:45.420 --> 02:50.660]  I mean, there's just so much material, because when you're trying to communicate the serious
[02:50.660 --> 02:59.100]  sober diastrates message that the Earth is in peril, what better way to do so than this?
[02:59.100 --> 03:13.300]  Well, I was a bit skeptical before, but that's me convinced.
[03:13.300 --> 03:21.940]  Now I'm convinced if only we could figure out a technological way to harness the power
[03:21.940 --> 03:36.980]  of crazy to replace fossil fuels, because Jesus Christ, it's in plentiful supply.
[03:36.980 --> 03:42.700]  And there's this guy.
[03:42.700 --> 03:47.900]  In the fountain of rational credibility, but get this, they arrested him when he was about
[03:47.900 --> 03:49.380]  to save the Amazon.
[03:49.380 --> 03:52.020]  He's here to save the Amazon.
[03:52.020 --> 03:56.140]  Amazon's f***ed now, press F to pay respects, and there's this guy.
[03:56.140 --> 04:00.740]  I'm just a father of two children, there's very frightened of their future.
[04:00.740 --> 04:04.060]  Imagine turning on the TV and seeing your dad crying because of the weather.
[04:04.060 --> 04:09.140]  Psychologists are warning about a new trend of eco-anxiety amongst children.
[04:09.140 --> 04:13.580]  They're literally terrifying kids into believing that their parents and all their friends are
[04:13.580 --> 04:15.620]  going to be dead in 12 years.
[04:15.620 --> 04:21.380]  A hundred years ago, weather-related disasters killed half a million people a year.
[04:21.380 --> 04:25.740]  Today, it's 20,000 a year, a reduction of 95%.
[04:25.740 --> 04:29.660]  It does not lead to a death of billions.
[04:29.660 --> 04:33.220]  I mean, aren't you scaring people with this rhetoric, aren't you?
[04:33.220 --> 04:34.220]  Alarmist language works.
[04:34.220 --> 04:44.620]  Then there's this, the f*** is that, go clean up a beach or something.
[04:44.620 --> 04:50.180]  This isn't a protest, this isn't taking action, it's a social occasion, it's burning man
[04:50.180 --> 04:58.780]  on Thames, it's a bunch of sanctimonious privileged posh twats lecturing working class people
[04:58.780 --> 05:02.580]  on why their living standards should be reduced even further.
[05:02.580 --> 05:08.300]  Because of middle-class vegans occupying Smithfield Meat Market, preventing ordinary working people
[05:08.300 --> 05:09.300]  from...
[05:09.300 --> 05:14.980]  Globalism was doomed to fail if we just exposed it and then resisted it.
[05:14.980 --> 05:19.340]  Didn't I say a thousand times that there's no way you're going to have an authoritarian
[05:19.340 --> 05:22.940]  corporate world government above the law that doesn't pay taxes, that has diplomatic
[05:22.940 --> 05:27.860]  immunity, that runs around saying it's communist and socialist, power to the people, but then
[05:27.860 --> 05:30.020]  meanwhile is tax exempt again offshore?
[05:30.020 --> 05:33.620]  Well Trump got that and all these other populists get it.
[05:33.620 --> 05:37.820]  Why would you throw away wealthy successful countries and cultures just so you can say
[05:37.820 --> 05:42.740]  the communist Chinese that David Rockefeller put in power are better than everybody?
[05:42.740 --> 05:48.580]  That is a sick freakish joke and I will not stand by and watch humanity turn over to these
[05:48.580 --> 05:53.780]  people and I beg God for the strength and the will to have the discernment to help
[05:53.780 --> 05:59.500]  be part of their defeat and I've been saying that prayer for 20 plus years and God is delivering
[05:59.500 --> 06:05.340]  because God is great, thank God for his son Jesus Christ and now let's move forward against
[06:05.340 --> 06:06.340]  the NW.
[06:06.340 --> 06:07.340]  We've got it.
[06:07.340 --> 06:17.340]  That Christmas is coming to you.
[06:17.340 --> 06:26.340]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[06:26.340 --> 06:53.780]  the Info War.
[06:53.780 --> 07:02.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, October 17th, 2019.
[07:02.860 --> 07:11.540]  I'm your host Alex Jones and we've got some massive news to cover here today for you.
[07:11.540 --> 07:16.820]  President Trump is scheduled to give a rally speech, an event tonight in Dallas, Texas
[07:16.820 --> 07:22.700]  north of where I sit, I'm coming to you from Austin and we're going to have five members
[07:22.700 --> 07:30.820]  of our crew up there and two reporters giving live coverage.
[07:30.820 --> 07:36.500]  Then this morning I'm watching David Knight once I got into the office and he's playing
[07:36.500 --> 07:42.980]  a clip of Joe Biden talking about we need to stop fighting with each other and focus
[07:42.980 --> 07:51.060]  on removing Trump on the 17th and then Biden closes his eyes and then changes the subject.
[07:51.060 --> 07:58.020]  Then Nancy Pelosi today got up during a press conference and looked completely freaked out
[07:58.020 --> 08:00.940]  and whacked out and I had people in the office coming out to me.
[08:00.940 --> 08:05.900]  I had phone calls, I had text messages, I never get saying Pelosi looks particularly
[08:05.900 --> 08:13.860]  crazy today and did you see her hold up her arm and tap on and point at bullets that she's
[08:13.860 --> 08:22.020]  never worn projectiles hanging around her wrist.
[08:22.020 --> 08:28.220]  So Biden says, and it takes a few days for anybody to notice, he says two nights ago
[08:28.220 --> 08:32.860]  that they're going to remove Trump on the 17th, then he goes, oh, he shouldn't have
[08:32.860 --> 08:37.580]  said that but clearly it's a message, Pelosi is holding up her arm during a press conference
[08:37.580 --> 08:52.380]  looking totally freaked out saying that she's so sad about Elijah Cummings dying while she's
[08:52.380 --> 08:58.820]  pointing at bullets on a bracelet on her wrist.
[08:58.820 --> 09:01.100]  This is beyond signalling.
[09:01.100 --> 09:07.300]  This is straight out and then you've got Elijah Cummings dying in his home reportedly
[09:07.300 --> 09:08.820]  been sick for months.
[09:08.820 --> 09:09.820]  We already know that.
[09:09.820 --> 09:16.260]  But just the timing of all of this and then we're only a month or so away from the next
[09:16.260 --> 09:22.260]  anniversary in Dallas, a president Kennedy getting his head blown off in Dealey Plaza.
[09:22.260 --> 09:26.660]  And as soon as we came to this realization this morning, Kit Daniels, one of our great
[09:26.660 --> 09:31.140]  writers and researchers went in and lined up the dates because of leap years and the
[09:31.140 --> 09:37.740]  way years line up on the calendar, this is the same day that Kennedy was killed.
[09:37.740 --> 09:47.740]  If you look at the physical days on the calendar, when Kennedy was killed in Dallas in 1963,
[09:47.740 --> 09:52.380]  and then you've got all of these people like Phil Mudd who ran assassinations.
[09:52.380 --> 09:55.820]  He gave the orders at the CIA saying we're going to stab Julian in the back.
[09:55.820 --> 09:56.820]  We're going to kill Trump.
[09:56.820 --> 10:03.460]  You've got all these calls to assassinate Trump, it's amazing.
[10:03.460 --> 10:07.660]  So all of these things are lining up and I always go with my gut because I've learned
[10:07.660 --> 10:08.660]  how right it is.
[10:08.660 --> 10:10.460]  My wife was really upset this morning saying, I have a bad feeling.
[10:10.460 --> 10:11.460]  Come on early.
[10:11.460 --> 10:15.140]  We shouldn't, you know, I just have a bad feeling and she's never like that.
[10:15.140 --> 10:18.460]  Kit Daniels this morning, two hours ago said, man, I got a bad feeling about today.
[10:18.460 --> 10:22.980]  I had a bad feeling about the crew up in Dallas and I said, well, what's your bad?
[10:22.980 --> 10:23.980]  He goes, I don't know.
[10:23.980 --> 10:27.860]  I've known Kit many years, he's never talked like that.
[10:27.860 --> 10:31.780]  I'm like, yeah, my wife was upset this morning and everybody can feel it.
[10:31.780 --> 10:34.580]  Everybody's been upset the last few weeks and they're saying they're going to kill the
[10:34.580 --> 10:40.700]  president on the news, but they're going to remove him outside of impeachment.
[10:40.700 --> 10:43.180]  And then Pelosi comes out and says, well, we're not going to move forward with impeachment
[10:43.180 --> 10:44.180]  right now.
[10:44.180 --> 10:48.660]  She's got this secret hearing going on that's not really a real trial.
[10:48.660 --> 10:54.260]  Let's say kangaroo court, it's a coup behind closed doors, Cummings dies.
[10:54.260 --> 10:56.260]  He's involved in the whole thing.
[10:56.260 --> 11:00.260]  Trump's about to be in Dallas and if they were planning to try to assassinate Trump
[11:00.260 --> 11:06.580]  in Dallas tonight, us talking about it and us exposing it could stop it from happening.
[11:06.580 --> 11:12.500]  But I think it's very reasonable to say his life's in serious danger.
[11:12.500 --> 11:17.620]  When we've had the deep state on television, Clapper and Brennan saying we're going to remove
[11:17.620 --> 11:24.100]  him outside of law, we're going to remove him.
[11:24.100 --> 11:28.180]  You'll see that was on CNN with Wolf Blitzer.
[11:28.180 --> 11:31.220]  I said, that's a clear threat to the president right there.
[11:31.220 --> 11:36.100]  And I called for people to call the Secret Service will Secret Service called me and
[11:36.100 --> 11:38.740]  they said, listen, we're not calling thinking you're threatening the president.
[11:38.740 --> 11:44.100]  We were told by someone in the White House to call you and get any more details you have.
[11:44.100 --> 11:48.180]  And I said, any more details I have, they're on TV saying they're going to remove him outside
[11:48.180 --> 11:50.420]  of impeachment.
[11:50.420 --> 11:54.660]  That means grabbing, drug him or shooting or kidnapping.
[11:54.660 --> 11:58.180]  And there was a leading Secret Service agent said, no, you're right, that's what we think
[11:58.180 --> 11:59.180]  too.
[11:59.180 --> 12:00.660]  Well, who do you think is leading this?
[12:00.660 --> 12:02.500]  And I said, you know who?
[12:02.500 --> 12:09.900]  It's Coney, it's Brennan, it's Clapper, but they all work for Hillary and for the permanent
[12:09.900 --> 12:14.700]  state and Obama who put stay behind networks there, and I sent the Secret Service all the
[12:14.700 --> 12:17.740]  articles where they admitted all this.
[12:17.740 --> 12:20.300]  So they're still in command of part of the government.
[12:20.300 --> 12:23.780]  They're saying Trump's not real, they're saying he works for foreign governments, they're
[12:23.780 --> 12:26.860]  saying he's working with foreign governments again, they're saying all his supporters work
[12:26.860 --> 12:36.020]  for foreign governments, and they're saying that they're getting ready to take them out.
[12:36.020 --> 12:38.180]  Not just Trump, but his supporters.
[12:38.180 --> 12:51.380]  So let's roll this clip of two nights ago, the former vice president, the gangster thug
[12:51.380 --> 12:54.860]  Joe Biden in what is a clear as day threat.
[12:54.860 --> 13:02.260]  Because then you line it up, we've got to focus on removing Trump on the 17th.
[13:02.260 --> 13:03.260]  That's today.
[13:03.260 --> 13:04.260]  Here it is.
[13:04.260 --> 13:09.780]  My son's the same as Biggs for himself, what I think is important is we focus on why it's
[13:09.780 --> 13:12.700]  so important to remove this man from office.
[13:12.700 --> 13:21.700]  On the 17th, look, the fact that George Washington worried, my son's the same as Biggs for himself.
[13:21.700 --> 13:29.260]  What I think is important is we focus on why it's so important to remove this man from
[13:29.260 --> 13:30.260]  office.
[13:30.260 --> 13:40.260]  On the 17th, look, the fact that why it's so important to remove this man from office.
[13:40.260 --> 13:49.740]  On the 17th, look, the fact that why it's so important to remove this man from office.
[13:49.740 --> 13:54.740]  On the 17th, look, the fact that.
[13:54.740 --> 14:00.380]  And they've been saying they want to remove him, and they're going to do it by force,
[14:00.380 --> 14:02.580]  they're going to do it by the 22nd amendment.
[14:02.580 --> 14:07.820]  So that's criminals that have a history of things like this with a gun loaded with the
[14:07.820 --> 14:15.340]  safety off with the firearm cocked with the gun to our head.
[14:15.340 --> 14:17.100]  And so we better take it serious.
[14:17.100 --> 14:20.020]  I will be here live tonight covering it.
[14:20.020 --> 14:24.860]  I'm tempted to get in my car and drive to Dallas after I get off at two o'clock today,
[14:24.860 --> 14:26.340]  all Watson hosts the fourth hour.
[14:26.340 --> 14:28.260]  But you notice all hell's breaking loose.
[14:28.260 --> 14:30.180]  I did so much preparation for the show.
[14:30.180 --> 14:34.220]  I had so much incredible news that I was just dedicated to covering it all.
[14:34.220 --> 14:39.420]  And then like a ton of bricks, it all crystallized 10 minutes before the show.
[14:39.420 --> 14:41.260]  And that wasn't an act earlier.
[14:41.260 --> 14:44.380]  When you saw me, if you're watching the first five minutes and I had to go off air, I've
[14:44.380 --> 14:45.700]  never choked on air.
[14:45.700 --> 14:47.460]  I've never not been able to broadcast.
[14:47.460 --> 14:50.900]  I don't get scared in front of crowds of 10,000 people are on national TV.
[14:50.900 --> 14:51.900]  You've seen it.
[14:51.900 --> 14:55.580]  I can barely do the show right now.
[14:55.580 --> 15:00.860]  And I appreciate this crew because they are very close to the zeitgeist as well, like
[15:00.860 --> 15:01.860]  we all are.
[15:01.860 --> 15:03.060]  And it's very stressful for them.
[15:03.060 --> 15:07.580]  So we need your prayers here that we have a steady hand and that we have a spirit, not
[15:07.580 --> 15:11.460]  a fear, but of strength and power and discernment, which I do.
[15:11.460 --> 15:12.460]  I'm not afraid.
[15:12.460 --> 15:18.340]  I'm just the magnitude of all of this and you can see it right there that they say they
[15:18.340 --> 15:19.340]  want him dead.
[15:19.340 --> 15:20.700]  They produce all these movies about him dead.
[15:20.700 --> 15:24.300]  They have images of a severed head everywhere.
[15:24.300 --> 15:27.140]  And then they have these top people that run assassination operations saying they're going
[15:27.140 --> 15:29.140]  to kill him.
[15:29.140 --> 15:30.900]  They're totally making their move right now.
[15:30.900 --> 15:34.940]  They're apoplectic because Trump's getting ready to have them indicted.
[15:34.940 --> 15:35.940]  The indictments are there.
[15:35.940 --> 15:36.940]  That's confirmed.
[15:36.940 --> 15:41.820]  And the word is the AG report's coming out any day now to the planets are aligned.
[15:41.820 --> 15:46.060]  And so he'd be dumb to not be saying they plan to assassinate him and history repeats
[15:46.060 --> 15:48.300]  and the globalists want to send a message.
[15:48.300 --> 15:52.820]  And if I know Trump, he's not going to cancel tonight, but everybody should be calling the
[15:52.820 --> 15:55.700]  secret service, the White House, everybody.
[15:55.700 --> 15:57.740]  And then they can say, oh, look, they said they'd try to kill him.
[15:57.740 --> 15:58.740]  It didn't happen.
[15:58.740 --> 16:00.100]  Oh, they're conspiracy theorist.
[16:00.100 --> 16:01.260]  That means we would have stopped it.

[16:02.420 --> 16:03.420]  You know it.
[16:03.420 --> 16:06.900]  They're going to have a coup attempt on President Trump tonight in Dallas.

[20:33.380 --> 20:41.900]  Trump sent Dallas tonight, they're gonna try to kill him.
[20:41.900 --> 20:44.020]  Everybody knows it.
[20:44.020 --> 20:50.580]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[20:50.580 --> 20:54.820]  They've been saying they're gonna kill him.
[20:54.820 --> 20:59.260]  The guy that ran the CIA assassination teams, Phil Mudd.
[20:59.260 --> 21:01.740]  He's gonna say he's gonna kill Giuliani.
[21:01.740 --> 21:05.980]  They've been saying they're gonna remove him outside of impeachment.
[21:05.980 --> 21:09.060]  Elijah Cummings drops dead.
[21:09.060 --> 21:12.300]  Nancy Pelosi gets up on TV looking completely psychotic.
[21:12.300 --> 21:15.020]  My phone's ringing, text messages, everybody's like, look at her.
[21:15.020 --> 21:18.700]  She looks 10 times crazier than ever.
[21:18.700 --> 21:22.900]  Oh, and Shroyer was tweeting out, he's not even in the office for hours, wow, Pelosi
[21:22.900 --> 21:24.340]  looks nuts.
[21:24.340 --> 21:25.340]  Everyone saw it.
[21:25.340 --> 21:27.420]  We're gonna play part of it coming up.
[21:27.420 --> 21:28.540]  We're like, what is it?
[21:28.540 --> 21:31.980]  My wife's like, don't go to work, I'm scared.
[21:31.980 --> 21:36.100]  She's calling me up, going, I just, I just am worried.
[21:36.100 --> 21:37.100]  Come home.
[21:37.100 --> 21:45.060]  Kit Daniels is, I'm worried, I'm worried about, because we have a six cents, folks.
[21:45.060 --> 21:48.580]  Maybe an 8.5 is about to hit LA and it's gonna drop in the ocean.
[21:48.580 --> 21:51.540]  You know, there are 20 something years behind it in the earthquake.
[21:51.540 --> 21:54.940]  They just came out and proved that there's all these microquakes they can never detect.
[21:54.940 --> 21:57.340]  That is what birds and mice are scared of.
[21:57.340 --> 21:58.340]  The ancients knew.
[21:58.340 --> 22:02.260]  You see rats and mice climbing out of their holes, hauling ass.
[22:02.260 --> 22:03.260]  The Romans knew that.
[22:03.260 --> 22:04.780]  They had a lot of volcanoes over there.
[22:04.780 --> 22:10.380]  If you saw the rats and stuff hauling ass out of the town, people would say, well, in
[22:10.380 --> 22:13.140]  a couple days we're gonna have a big earthquake, get ready.
[22:13.140 --> 22:18.060]  In fact, in a lot of earthquake stricken areas, ancient Japan and China, they would
[22:18.060 --> 22:22.260]  leave the cities when they saw the animals running, because they knew the animals were
[22:22.260 --> 22:23.580]  more sensitive than us.
[22:23.580 --> 22:25.900]  So maybe a massive earthquake's about to hit.
[22:25.900 --> 22:30.340]  You know, I've had these feelings of dread before and then they always come true, but
[22:30.340 --> 22:31.340]  it's something else.
[22:31.340 --> 22:34.100]  Maybe it's a stock market crash.
[22:34.100 --> 22:39.100]  But something big is already happening and it's about to happen, because all the anxiety
[22:39.100 --> 22:43.940]  I've been having the last few months is now at explosion level.
[22:43.940 --> 22:50.660]  I'm serious, I can barely do the show right now.
[22:50.660 --> 22:54.340]  And my whole life, I didn't go with my gut, and now I've been going with my gut the last
[22:54.340 --> 22:59.860]  five years or so, and it's just like it's never wrong, but it can be confused.
[22:59.860 --> 23:04.700]  Our spirits, our guts, and all the cells that pick up everything going on in the universe,
[23:04.700 --> 23:09.300]  big studies are out that your skin picks up light, and your skin picks up wind, and your
[23:09.300 --> 23:12.740]  skin picks up all these things and has its own brain.
[23:12.740 --> 23:16.420]  Everybody always knew that, and you get depressed if you don't get sunlight.
[23:16.420 --> 23:17.620]  That's in studies.
[23:17.620 --> 23:19.740]  All the ancients already had it all figured out.
[23:19.740 --> 23:24.060]  We ignore all that to our own peril, but what I'm getting at, and I'll do it next segment,
[23:24.060 --> 23:31.860]  is I'm going to scientifically, historically, mathematically, with the evidence, walk through
[23:31.860 --> 23:35.260]  the fact that they are going to try to assassinate the president because they don't have the
[23:35.260 --> 23:39.980]  votes of the Senate, and they've tried to threaten everybody, and it's not worked.
[23:39.980 --> 23:45.180]  And yes, Pelosi has this secret court, it's illegal, it's not a real impeachment hearing.
[23:45.180 --> 23:48.980]  She wanted to get the evidence in that to bring forward the full impeachment.
[23:48.980 --> 23:51.780]  And yes, Mitch McConnell says he believes they're going to impeach Trump.
[23:51.780 --> 23:55.380]  He says by Christmas they're going to have a trial, because Pelosi's already set the
[23:55.380 --> 23:56.380]  timetable.
[23:56.380 --> 24:00.340]  They set that two weeks ago, and people are like, Jones claims he knows when they're
[24:00.340 --> 24:05.300]  going to have the trial, they said what they were going to do.
[24:05.300 --> 24:09.940]  You don't go off the press conferences, you go off what they put out to their members
[24:09.940 --> 24:13.740]  that's public but not easy to find.
[24:13.740 --> 24:19.980]  And she said, whenever this started, what, three weeks ago, four weeks ago, she said,
[24:19.980 --> 24:24.100]  we're going to have the vote by Thanksgiving.
[24:24.100 --> 24:28.660]  And then we're going to have the trial by Christmas.
[24:28.660 --> 24:32.020]  And then here's Mitch McConnell.
[24:32.020 --> 24:33.020]  Prepare for impeachment.
[24:33.020 --> 24:37.980]  McConnell tells GOP senators, and you read deeper, they believe in the closed door meeting
[24:37.980 --> 24:40.980]  they have that it's now leaked that they're going to impeach him.
[24:40.980 --> 24:44.060]  Of course they are, they've got the votes.
[24:44.060 --> 24:48.060]  Now it's come out, ladies and gentlemen, that witnesses have now released transcripts that
[24:48.060 --> 24:52.820]  Adam Schiff is blowing up, can't get anyone to go on the record and actually say they
[24:52.820 --> 24:56.340]  heard Trump doing anything illegal, even his enemies, because they know there's transcripts
[24:56.340 --> 24:59.660]  on their witnesses.
[24:59.660 --> 25:00.660]  Here's the headline.
[25:00.660 --> 25:05.140]  Adam Schiff pressured witness to change his story, accused Trump of pressuring Ukraine.
[25:05.140 --> 25:11.780]  We have the transcript, and they admit it's a transcript.
[25:11.780 --> 25:13.900]  So even these star chambers were getting information.
[25:13.900 --> 25:21.540]  This is a coup behind closed doors, so I'm going to get completely calm, and I'm going
[25:21.540 --> 25:26.740]  to get focused, and I'm going to come back and lay out why this is so serious.
[25:26.740 --> 25:27.820]  And I want to explain something.
[25:27.820 --> 25:31.500]  I walked around the office during the last break, and I said, what do you think of them
[25:31.500 --> 25:34.380]  trying to assassinate Trump in Dallas, and folks said, well, they've been saying they
[25:34.380 --> 25:35.380]  are.
[25:35.380 --> 25:39.380]  So when somebody says we're going to kill the president, and they've overthrown governments
[25:39.380 --> 25:44.580]  and run up races killing people, you listen to them, it'd be like if a guy got out of
[25:44.580 --> 25:48.420]  jail that robbed banks and been convicted three times, and he'd been in jail for 20
[25:48.420 --> 25:54.100]  years, and he gets out and he says, I'm going to go rob the first national bank today.
[25:54.100 --> 25:59.700]  You call the cops, because this guy does what he says he's going to do.
[25:59.700 --> 26:03.940]  Well we allowed this vacuum to go, where all this has been allowed to take place, and they're
[26:03.940 --> 26:07.780]  legitimizing it and normalizing it, and you go, well that'll cause a civil war.
[26:07.780 --> 26:10.260]  They want a civil war.
[26:10.260 --> 26:14.060]  The globalists want this country shut down.
[26:14.060 --> 26:15.700]  We're at war with the globalists.
[26:15.700 --> 26:17.860]  They've maneuvered us with traitors towards destruction.
[26:17.860 --> 26:18.860]  That was supposed to already happen.
[26:18.860 --> 26:22.500]  They were going to just smother us in the night with a pillow over our faces with Hillary,
[26:22.500 --> 26:23.500]  and we never know it.
[26:23.500 --> 26:26.620]  But when Trump getting in, there's going to be a fight.
[26:26.620 --> 26:28.500]  That's the way God works.
[26:28.500 --> 26:29.500]  Justice.
[26:29.500 --> 26:33.860]  And I would say God is, in a good way, quite a warrior.
[26:33.860 --> 26:37.060]  I mean, this is very entertaining in a sick way.
[26:37.060 --> 26:46.900]  So ladies and gentlemen, they killed Kennedy and Dallas in front of the whole world, and
[26:46.900 --> 26:51.220]  then killed Lee Harvey Oswald in front of everybody.
[26:51.220 --> 26:52.780]  And Lee and Maca did this in the studio later.
[26:52.780 --> 26:57.380]  She said, yeah, but it'd be pretty obvious if they killed him in Dallas.
[26:57.380 --> 27:02.300]  But then she goes, but they did kill Jeffrey Epstein in front of everybody and let it come
[27:02.300 --> 27:03.300]  out.
[27:03.300 --> 27:04.300]  They broke his neck.
[27:04.300 --> 27:07.980]  It could be because, see, that's it.
[27:07.980 --> 27:09.300]  It's a ritual.
[27:09.300 --> 27:15.380]  They killed Trump in the Lone Star State.
[27:15.380 --> 27:23.740]  They killed Trump in the Lone Star State.
[27:23.740 --> 27:27.420]  They killed Kennedy in the Lone Star State.
[27:27.420 --> 27:31.580]  They're trying to kill Trump in the Lone Star State.
[27:31.580 --> 27:36.940]  I was thinking about something this morning and had a Freudian slip because your subconscious
[27:36.940 --> 27:39.700]  brain, again, is hundreds of times more powerful than your conscious.
[27:39.700 --> 27:41.060]  That's a fact.
[27:41.060 --> 27:44.380]  And I've never worn this belt buckle.
[27:44.380 --> 27:50.620]  It was given to me and it was hanging there in my closet.
[27:50.620 --> 27:54.340]  And I went and I put it on a belt that, when I looked at it, didn't even make any sense
[27:54.340 --> 27:55.340]  this morning.
[27:55.340 --> 28:01.620]  But I thought there's some kind of omen, my subconscious mind is trying to tell me, and
[28:01.620 --> 28:03.220]  no wonder I can't get it off.
[28:03.220 --> 28:10.140]  I've got the microphone unit hooked up to my belt.
[28:10.140 --> 28:17.780]  But I was sitting there this morning, hard to get this damn belt off, and I was thinking
[28:17.780 --> 28:18.780]  about it.
[28:18.780 --> 28:22.900]  And I went and I got this Lone Star State belt buckle.
[28:22.900 --> 28:33.900]  Well, I was given many years ago, it's bronze, and I put it on this belt that says 1776 established
[28:33.900 --> 28:37.860]  1776, and it's American Eagles on it.
[28:37.860 --> 28:47.000]  And then I was looking at that and I said, why pair the Lone Star State with American
[28:47.000 --> 28:55.180]  Eagles 1776 belt, that I had a Molon Labe belt buckle on, and I thought Texas holds
[28:55.180 --> 29:01.140]  the fate of America, and I looked at the Eagles, and I said, no, Texas holds the fate of the
[29:01.140 --> 29:02.140]  president.
[29:02.140 --> 29:05.780]  I'm sitting there after I brush my teeth, putting this belt on, and I'm thinking, why
[29:05.780 --> 29:07.740]  am I so obsessed with this?
[29:07.740 --> 29:08.740]  Am I going crazy?
[29:08.740 --> 29:12.780]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[29:12.780 --> 29:14.700]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[29:14.700 --> 29:16.380]  I had a problem like you once.
[29:16.380 --> 29:21.820]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[29:21.820 --> 29:22.940]  my life.
[29:22.940 --> 29:28.180]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[29:28.180 --> 29:33.380]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[29:33.380 --> 29:36.540]  you need to call the national treatment advisors.
[29:36.540 --> 29:41.220]  They'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[29:41.220 --> 29:43.540]  and totally change your life.
[29:43.540 --> 29:48.780]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[29:48.780 --> 29:52.060]  Fix your problem right now, before it gets any worse.

[30:48.980 --> 30:53.220]  drive the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.

[32:06.980 --> 32:09.180]  sale at M4store.com.
[32:09.180 --> 32:13.500]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from M4.
[32:13.500 --> 32:19.180]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of
[32:19.180 --> 32:23.900]  corporate tyranny, has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S. but worldwide.
[32:23.900 --> 32:29.500]  And President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty
[32:29.500 --> 32:30.900]  is amazing as well.
[32:30.900 --> 32:36.420]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas.
[32:36.420 --> 32:41.220]  But trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China, Trump's
[32:41.220 --> 32:46.660]  been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever, we really have to realize that we're
[32:46.660 --> 32:51.820]  being targeted because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their
[32:51.820 --> 32:54.740]  war against humanity in a big way.
[32:54.740 --> 32:58.580]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them, but it's critical to not let
[32:58.580 --> 33:03.020]  ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[33:03.020 --> 33:04.940]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[33:04.940 --> 33:12.340]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[33:12.340 --> 33:42.140]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:42.140 --> 33:51.580]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, Texas is the reason that the president is dead.
[33:51.580 --> 34:00.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, Kennedy was killed in Dallas, Texas in November of 1963.
[34:00.820 --> 34:04.780]  President Trump is going to be speaking in Dallas tonight.
[34:04.780 --> 34:13.820]  And we have all of these shocking statements by the former director of assassination operations
[34:13.820 --> 34:20.860]  of the CIA, Phil Mudd, saying they're going to kill President Trump and stab Giuliani
[34:20.860 --> 34:24.100]  in the back with a dagger, with a ship.
[34:24.100 --> 34:30.300]  We have Brennan and Clapper saying they're going to remove Trump from office outside
[34:30.300 --> 34:36.020]  of impeachment.
[34:36.020 --> 34:40.140]  And then we have the reason we're coming out saying the deep state has signaled that they
[34:40.140 --> 34:45.260]  are going to kill or try to kill President Trump in Dallas tonight.
[34:45.260 --> 34:51.660]  And I can tell you there have been secret service investigations of Phil Mudd.
[34:51.660 --> 34:56.820]  There have been investigations into Brennan and Clapper saying they were going to kill
[34:56.820 --> 35:01.860]  and going to remove the president.
[35:01.860 --> 35:03.660]  They were on that stage with Blitzer.
[35:03.660 --> 35:04.660]  Blitzer says impeachment.
[35:04.660 --> 35:05.660]  And they said, no.
[35:05.660 --> 35:06.660]  22nd Amendment.
[35:06.660 --> 35:10.300]  And they went, no.
[35:10.300 --> 35:15.940]  And even Blitzer got scared because the former director of national intelligence, former
[35:15.940 --> 35:21.020]  director of the CIA, both on the stage, shall I play the clip again for you?
[35:21.020 --> 35:30.980]  And then now he's in Dallas and two nights ago, we have the signaling by Joe Biden.
[35:30.980 --> 35:38.500]  And then today in a press conference, we have Nancy Pelosi holding up a bracelet with bullets
[35:38.500 --> 35:46.700]  on it and fondling them and feeling on them and then talking about Trump.
[35:46.700 --> 35:48.980]  This is insane.
[35:48.980 --> 35:54.020]  They are absolutely telegraphing their intent, ladies and gentlemen.
[35:54.020 --> 35:55.500]  And they've said they want him dead.
[35:55.500 --> 36:01.580]  So let's play this compilation first of Biden with a subrouter film and with Pelosi in the
[36:01.580 --> 36:05.940]  past talking about her bullet bracelet in case you think we're making this up.
[36:05.940 --> 36:11.180]  And then we'll get to the latest with her holding up the bullet bracelet while she talks
[36:11.180 --> 36:15.260]  about Trump and then fondles the bullets.
[36:15.260 --> 36:21.300]  So ladies and gentlemen, when she talks about orange bullets, bullets aren't orange.
[36:21.300 --> 36:29.380]  Well, it's not an orange, ladies and gentlemen, orange bullets for orange man.
[36:29.380 --> 36:33.900]  Yeah, this is in your, hell, they're saying on TV, they're going to kill him.
[36:33.900 --> 36:36.620]  So are they going to keep their word?
[36:36.620 --> 36:39.060]  I think about this, they're going to try.
[36:39.060 --> 36:41.700]  Let's go ahead and roll this.
[36:41.700 --> 36:43.940]  My son's the same as speaks for itself.
[36:43.940 --> 36:49.340]  What I think is important is we focus on why it's so important to remove this man from
[36:49.340 --> 36:58.640]  office on the 17 look the fact that what I think is important, is we focus on why it's
[36:58.640 --> 37:03.420]  so important to remove this man from office on the 17.
[37:03.420 --> 37:13.460]  Look the fact that what I think is important as we focus on why it's so important to remove
[37:13.460 --> 37:23.620]  this man from office. On the 17th look the fact that what I think is important is we focus on
[37:24.260 --> 37:33.620]  why it's so important to remove this man from office. On the 17th look the fact that bracelets
[37:33.620 --> 37:39.860]  are made with bullets in the color orange which is the color of gun violence protection this
[37:39.860 --> 37:45.940]  I told the president we're not going away. You know we've got one shot to make Donald Trump a
[37:45.940 --> 37:49.860]  one-term president. As a former government official government's going to kill this guy.
[37:51.700 --> 37:56.340]  So the guy that ran assassinations of foreign leaders Phil Mudd ran that he says we're going to
[37:56.340 --> 38:10.580]  kill the president and now everybody I know who's got any touch with the universe anybody who's
[38:10.580 --> 38:18.980]  connected feels the danger and you know maybe there's going to be a bomb go off in Dallas tonight
[38:18.980 --> 38:23.540]  maybe a big earthquake about to hit Los Angeles they say it's overdue it could be the big one and
[38:23.540 --> 38:27.860]  could kill tens of thousands of people and just devastate the economy of not just California
[38:27.860 --> 38:31.300]  but the U.S. I mean I'm not saying that's gonna happen just so many times when I've had a feeling
[38:31.300 --> 38:43.300]  of dread it never turns out to be wrong and we've all had those experiences you have a bad feeling
[38:43.300 --> 38:47.300]  you don't know why all of a sudden somebody walks up and puts a gun to your head and mugs you that
[38:47.300 --> 38:53.860]  happened or you got a bad feeling and you get home and your wife tells you she's leaving you
[38:54.580 --> 39:00.260]  or you got a bad feeling and you call your dad up and say hey let's go see grandma today and he
[39:00.260 --> 39:10.020]  goes listen I just got called five minutes ago she just died stuff like that you know had made
[39:10.020 --> 39:14.020]  a phone call about grandma in months and I just got a bad feeling about grandma can we go see her
[39:14.020 --> 39:24.740]  today well she just died five minutes ago we've all heard those stories we've all seen them in
[39:24.740 --> 39:35.460]  my case my dad's mom I remember Rex was about two years old so it was 15 years ago and she was in
[39:35.460 --> 39:40.660]  pretty decent shape she got a stroke and stuff it was an indication she was about to die she
[39:40.660 --> 39:45.780]  had a stroke a few years before complications were having a lung removed and I remember calling him
[39:47.380 --> 39:51.140]  the night before she died and she was fine I said I just want to go see her I just feel like
[39:51.140 --> 39:56.580]  really worried about her he was I have that same feeling so he got there like five a.m. in my house
[39:56.580 --> 40:00.900]  I've been on a late night radio show wouldn't get out of bed I usually get out of bed easy
[40:03.140 --> 40:04.660]  and I got up a couple hours later
[40:04.660 --> 40:13.300]  and a few minutes from the house you got a call from his brother on the cell phone she just died
[40:13.300 --> 40:23.300]  he missed it by minutes but that's what this sixth sense is it's a wireless internet it's real
[40:23.300 --> 40:31.140]  it's been proven and the problem is is that you know something's going on sometimes it's not what
[40:31.140 --> 40:37.140]  you think it is but obviously the president is in danger and obviously we should be raising the
[40:37.140 --> 40:40.900]  alarm that when you have all these politicians like Brett and Clapper saying they're going to
[40:40.900 --> 40:47.220]  remove them outside of impeachment that means they're going to debilitating arresting drugging
[40:47.220 --> 40:54.980]  or killing I mean that's all there is there and now they're talking about it openly and it's
[40:54.980 --> 41:00.740]  it's unbelievable because it's so authoritarian but they're saying it on the open to normalize it
[41:00.740 --> 41:05.140]  so that people in government will accept it and think that they're really in charge if they're
[41:05.140 --> 41:12.100]  acting like that and they're talking like that they're flexing when we come back I'm going to get
[41:12.100 --> 41:22.420]  into why they want to kill the president and why they're so desperate and why every passing day
[41:22.420 --> 41:26.740]  their system's falling apart but first I played the clip of Pelosi explaining that she has a bullet
[41:26.740 --> 41:32.740]  bracelet but let's show some of the press conference today with Pelosi talking cryptically and fondling
[41:32.740 --> 41:38.900]  the bullet bracelet looking like she's on five hits a Molly I mean I don't know but she looks like
[41:38.900 --> 41:44.500]  a reanimated corpse she's ready to go star in a zombie movie or the new season of The Walking
[41:44.500 --> 41:51.460]  Dead here she is what that is it seems to me it was a small bill in terms of guns again as I said
[41:51.460 --> 41:57.700]  to some of you earlier this is a bullet I was in Florida for was all over the country but when I
[41:57.700 --> 42:03.700]  was in Florida I received this from Frederica Wilson my colleague it's a bracelets are made with
[42:03.700 --> 42:10.260]  bullets in the color orange which is the color of gun violence protection this I told the president
[42:10.260 --> 42:14.580]  we're not okay and again there's so much so much fast moving this is yesterday's press conference
[42:14.580 --> 42:19.460]  she gave another one earlier we'll we'll grab that one there's so much going on there's so much
[42:19.460 --> 42:28.500]  happening it's just it's just a fog of war here but this response to come out and to say
[42:29.780 --> 42:38.260]  that hey they're trying to kill the president they're saying they're going to kill the president
[42:40.420 --> 42:44.420]  intelligence community has seven ways six ways from starting to get to you a Schumer said
[42:44.420 --> 42:48.020]  and then that head of that assassination operation who works for the Clintons
[42:48.020 --> 42:52.500]  now Obama says the government's going to kill this guy and now he's about to be in Dallas and
[42:52.500 --> 42:59.940]  Biden said Trump is going to be taken out on the 17th you heard him say it that's not a Freudian
[42:59.940 --> 43:05.780]  slip they're messaging each other they're publicly bragging it's what they do it's a ritual
[43:08.020 --> 43:13.140]  communist china quietly bought up hollywood more than a decade ago and they've been approving
[43:13.140 --> 43:19.220]  almost all the scripts that you see on television or in the movies for many years and now they own
[43:19.220 --> 43:24.180]  our debt now they own the democratic party now they've merged with silicon valley to censor
[43:24.180 --> 43:29.540]  patriots off the air washington post comes out and says they hope that gg ping the dictator of
[43:29.540 --> 43:36.980]  china will quote destroy trump that's a headline so info wars has been the paul revere this operation
[43:36.980 --> 43:42.020]  we have blown the whistle continuously and have been proven right and that's why it's more important
[43:42.020 --> 43:46.980]  than ever that we override silicon valley and their chai kong masters by word of mouth and

[46:19.940 --> 46:25.060]  been obsessing on china since you got on air 20 something years ago and and now it's all coming
[46:25.060 --> 46:29.460]  true how did you know it because the council on foreign relations is the shadow government and
[46:29.460 --> 46:35.860]  they admitted the plan to transfer all power to communist china and almost everyone calling me
[46:35.860 --> 46:41.220]  says yeah and they banned you because you were saying all that and how silicon valley google
[46:41.220 --> 46:45.780]  and apple moved over there and it's incredible and wow you're vindicated you're going to get back on
[46:45.780 --> 46:51.780]  the air now aren't you and no uh if we don't defeat this takeover you're all going to be taken off
[46:51.780 --> 46:55.540]  in fact you're all going to end up getting put in prison camps they're making their move they're
[46:55.540 --> 47:00.260]  coming for your guns they're coming for your kids they're coming for your right to religion
[47:00.260 --> 47:06.180]  they are coming for your soul well you know what they say you got to lower your ideals of freedom
[47:06.180 --> 47:14.660]  if you want to suck on the warm tea of china you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:19.780 --> 47:25.060]  my son's statement speaks for itself what i think is important is we focus on
[47:25.060 --> 47:31.460]  why it's so important to remove this man from office on the 17th look the fact that
[47:31.460 --> 47:39.700]  what i think is important is we focus on why it's so important to remove this man from office
[47:40.660 --> 47:48.500]  on the 17th look the fact that what i think is important is we focus on
[47:49.140 --> 47:57.540]  why it's so important to remove this man from office on the 17th look the fact that
[47:57.540 --> 48:05.260]  what I think is important is we focus on why it's so important to remove this
[48:05.260 --> 48:13.020]  man from office. On the 17th look the fact that... Bracelets are made with bullets
[48:13.020 --> 48:18.500]  in the color orange which is the color of gun violence protection this I told
[48:18.500 --> 48:23.580]  the president we're not going away. You know we've got one shot to make Donald
[48:23.580 --> 48:27.460]  Trump a one-term president. As former government official government's gonna
[48:27.460 --> 48:29.900]  kill this guy.
[48:48.900 --> 48:53.820]  President Trump also has a stop at a ribbon-cutting in King, Texas. We're gonna
[48:53.820 --> 49:00.140]  have a crew of five people to reporters in Dallas tonight covering the event. You
[49:00.140 --> 49:06.780]  saw Joe Biden say we need to focus on removing the president by the 17th and
[49:06.780 --> 49:12.620]  then he goes and then moves on from that. You've got Pelosi up there and all of
[49:12.620 --> 49:16.260]  her bizarre behavior. You've got Elijah Cummings dying. You've got all these deep
[49:16.260 --> 49:21.100]  staters saying they want to remove President Trump including killing him.
[49:21.100 --> 49:24.860]  All these Hollywood people, all these New York Times people calling for violence
[49:24.860 --> 49:32.420]  and Elijah Cummings dies. He had a lot of health problems but just the way these
[49:32.420 --> 49:35.860]  rituals work the way the universe works people would say well why would they
[49:35.860 --> 49:45.100]  want to try to kill Trump in Dallas all these years of 1963 because they are a
[49:45.100 --> 49:50.780]  cultist and if something worked before they believe they do it again and it's
[49:50.780 --> 49:57.900]  an even greater metaphysical event. If they tell you before they do it they
[49:57.900 --> 50:01.220]  call that lesser magic and believe it they follow the occult and that that
[50:01.220 --> 50:05.340]  means the big event will probably be successful. If they can tell you without
[50:05.340 --> 50:12.620]  you knowing then it makes the event even more powerful. But they also have to
[50:12.620 --> 50:15.220]  tell you metaphysically what they're gonna do. It's like the vampire has to
[50:15.220 --> 50:21.700]  come over at night, get you to invite it in and of course it comes back later.
[50:21.700 --> 50:27.220]  Can't cross the thresholds. You have to sign the deal with the devil. You have to
[50:27.220 --> 50:35.060]  metaphysically give over your will. You have to let the big bad wolf in. You have
[50:35.060 --> 50:40.580]  to say not by the hair of my chinny chin chin. So a lot of people have been
[50:40.580 --> 50:45.420]  feeling dread. A lot of concern. Could it be the giant earthquake? Animals that's
[50:45.420 --> 50:48.580]  in the news today confirm. Major scientific reports pick up earthquakes
[50:48.580 --> 50:53.180]  just like they thought birds, mice, soda humans.
[50:53.180 --> 50:56.460]  Ancients all reported that you see big green lights in the sky before an
[50:56.460 --> 50:59.260]  earthquake. They said oh that's just crazy. Ancients now they've been caught on
[50:59.260 --> 51:03.620]  tape because it causes so much electromagnetic tension that it causes a
[51:03.620 --> 51:08.740]  rural borealysis low in the atmosphere even during the day. I mean all these
[51:08.740 --> 51:12.180]  things we heard about the ancients didn't know what they were but they weren't
[51:12.180 --> 51:19.460]  making it up. So again I'm not saying Trump will be killed tonight but I'm
[51:19.460 --> 51:22.340]  saying they're saying they want to kill him and they've done things like this
[51:22.340 --> 51:29.460]  before and it's Dallas and then Kit Daniels who's the really co-editor of
[51:29.460 --> 51:37.180]  Info Wars with Paul Watson. He does a great job. He said check this out. He took
[51:37.180 --> 51:39.940]  me in there and he said you know about the Gregorian calendar versus the other
[51:39.940 --> 51:44.300]  calendar and you know examples George Washington's born on February 11th like
[51:44.300 --> 51:48.980]  I am but he was on the older calendar so now he wouldn't be but he said if you
[51:48.980 --> 51:54.220]  look even on Google calendars you can check the corresponding day from 365
[51:54.220 --> 52:02.500]  with the date 1963 and the sister or brother day of the day Kennedy was
[52:02.500 --> 52:08.380]  killed in November is October 17th 2019 and he's doing an article on it right
[52:08.380 --> 52:14.660]  now and boy the hair on the back of my neck stood up when I saw that and it
[52:14.660 --> 52:21.700]  goes into leap years the way it all works so the occultists are really into
[52:21.700 --> 52:26.300]  all of this I'm not into it but they're heavily obsessed with numerology they're
[52:26.300 --> 52:32.460]  heavily obsessed with the occult it's all coming out and it's a big ritual to
[52:32.460 --> 52:38.020]  kill somebody like Trump and the fact that you see Elijah Cummings die that
[52:38.020 --> 52:42.100]  just adds to all of this and then the press conference for Pelosi looks so
[52:42.100 --> 52:46.940]  completely whacked out why would they want Trump dead because he really is
[52:46.940 --> 52:50.180]  fulfilling his promises he's fighting the Chai Khan takeover he's pulling
[52:50.180 --> 52:59.780]  troops out of places he's saying that it's not our business to be in Syria and
[52:59.780 --> 53:04.380]  he's saying it looks like global a stage the release of some al-Qaeda and Isis
[53:04.380 --> 53:09.860]  who Obama helped create Isis in Syria as a pretext to keep us there and he's
[53:09.860 --> 53:14.000]  exposing ABC News showing fake war video that's really knob crate machine gun
[53:14.000 --> 53:20.060]  shoot out he's fighting back he's for real doesn't mean he's perfect it just
[53:20.060 --> 53:27.060]  means he's a different archetype than them who isn't satanic that doesn't want
[53:27.060 --> 53:32.060]  to destroy things he's more the archetype of a man of a king of wealth of
[53:32.060 --> 53:41.700]  victory of strength of America of success we don't need Satan no thank you
[53:42.300 --> 53:53.580]  bullish confident maybe even arrogant but respecting God not respecting Satan
[53:53.580 --> 53:58.860]  not a slave of Satan a real president there's not just evil in the universe
[53:58.860 --> 54:03.940]  and they don't know what to do so why are they so angry at Trump well remember
[54:03.940 --> 54:07.820]  the speech he gave just last week in Minnesota that scared them so bad
[54:07.820 --> 54:11.740]  bless her to the peacemakers and the left has come out against the president
[54:11.740 --> 54:16.740]  and against what he said remember Obama made it secret that the video and
[54:16.740 --> 54:20.340]  photos of the coffins wouldn't let the family release videos or photos he
[54:20.340 --> 54:25.220]  want you to see the dead trips or value them as humans Trump does here's why
[54:25.220 --> 54:27.940]  they want to kill Trump
[54:29.900 --> 54:36.700]  I'm letters it's the hardest thing I have to do I signed letters dear mr. and
[54:36.700 --> 54:43.380]  mrs. Smith from Arkansas dear mr. and mrs. Jones from Alabama dear mr. and
[54:43.380 --> 54:50.780]  mrs. somebody from some great state I'm sorry to inform you your son has been
[54:50.780 --> 54:56.540]  killed in combat I'm so sorry it's the hardest thing that I have to do and I
[54:56.540 --> 55:01.420]  signed those letters and it just it it breaks your heart and sometimes I go
[55:01.420 --> 55:08.300]  out to a place Dover Air Force Base it's a very tough experience we go out
[55:08.300 --> 55:14.260]  there and we meet the parents and the families the wives the children the
[55:14.260 --> 55:21.260]  sisters the brothers we meet them and we talk to them these things are just
[55:21.260 --> 55:27.380]  impossible I don't know how parents can do it even and I'll be talking to some
[55:27.380 --> 55:31.860]  of the parents and they'll act like they're fine I said how you did we're
[55:31.860 --> 55:37.340]  fine sir we're fine we're really good I said that's great and I'll tell the
[55:37.340 --> 55:42.060]  colonels the colonel I think they're doing great no sir they're not going to
[55:42.060 --> 55:46.060]  do great you'll see and I didn't know what he was talking about this is the
[55:46.060 --> 55:51.740]  first time and then we went outside to the runway and this incredible machine
[55:51.740 --> 55:58.020]  is flying in and it lands and it comes over and it pulls up that door opens up
[55:58.020 --> 56:04.580]  and the colonel told me he said sir when that door opens up those same people
[56:04.580 --> 56:10.580]  that you think are okay do things that you'll never see you will hear sounds
[56:10.580 --> 56:15.740]  like you've never heard that's what it does and I saw that door open up with a
[56:15.740 --> 56:22.500]  coffin with a flag over it and these beautiful soldiers five or six on each
[56:22.500 --> 56:29.380]  side lifting the coffin and walking down the runway the plank they call it off
[56:29.380 --> 56:38.460]  this cargo plane and I see parents make sounds scream and cry like you've never
[56:38.460 --> 56:43.820]  seen before a mother who was fine 20 minutes ago you think breaking the
[56:43.820 --> 56:49.780]  military line and jumping off and then jumping onto a coffin of her son or her
[56:49.780 --> 56:55.460]  daughter jumping on on top of the flowers on top of the American flag I've
[56:55.460 --> 57:01.180]  seen this we were supposed to be in Syria for 30 days we've now been there
[57:01.180 --> 57:06.300]  for 10 years we were supposed to be in Afghanistan for a short period of time
[57:06.300 --> 57:12.500]  we're now going to be there for close to 19 years it's time to bring them home
[57:12.500 --> 57:16.300]  it's time to bring them home
[57:16.300 --> 57:25.660]  that reports on band on video Derek Green that put it together put it on his
[57:25.660 --> 57:29.300]  Facebook and they banned it for hate speech we actually never did a story
[57:29.300 --> 57:32.860]  about it we have the screenshot they said any more of that behavior you'll be
[57:32.860 --> 57:45.140]  banned unbelievable by the way there's so much news I haven't gotten to the ties
[57:45.140 --> 57:49.620]  into all of this but make no mistake Biden said they plan to remove Trump on
[57:49.620 --> 57:55.220]  the 17th the 17th it could be tonight in Dallas today is the 17th hour number two

[59:07.980 --> 59:12.300]  system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the US
[59:12.300 --> 59:16.780]  worldwide and President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting
[59:16.780 --> 59:22.220]  Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well he's still lacking on the big tech
[59:22.220 --> 59:26.860]  censorship taking action against that in some other areas but tried to end the
[59:26.860 --> 59:30.900]  wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist China Trump's been
[59:30.900 --> 59:36.220]  doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're
[59:36.220 --> 59:40.900]  being targeted because we are effective and the globalist are beginning to lose
[59:40.900 --> 59:45.220]  their war against humanity in a big way and so we're gonna see some major
[59:45.220 --> 59:50.140]  fireworks out of them but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we
[59:50.140 --> 59:54.460]  see all the poison they spray at us that's an attempt to demoralize us we've
[59:54.460 --> 1:00:02.820]  got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy you're listening to the
[1:00:02.820 --> 1:00:06.140]  alex jones show
[1:00:12.740 --> 1:00:22.740]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones because
[1:00:22.740 --> 1:00:26.100]  of time constraints I'm probably not gonna air it again today we probably aired
[1:00:26.100 --> 1:00:31.100]  it ten times the last months as we put it together it's a little compilation
[1:00:31.100 --> 1:00:35.540]  it's about three minutes long it's not even one-tenth of the examples with
[1:00:35.540 --> 1:00:43.260]  Democrats FBI CIA globalist operatives really globalist infiltrators you're
[1:00:43.260 --> 1:00:47.940]  not defending the CIA or the FBI but to just say it's the CIA or FBI is a lie
[1:00:47.940 --> 1:00:53.500]  it's globalist infiltrators through Harvard through Yale through this whole
[1:00:53.500 --> 1:00:59.940]  Rhodes Scholar system where they're inducted into this in charge of our
[1:00:59.940 --> 1:01:06.180]  country it's the British Empire I mean Churchill wrote about it it's not the
[1:01:06.180 --> 1:01:12.300]  British people it's that corporate system a very satanic very pedophilic
[1:01:12.300 --> 1:01:27.940]  very hellfire club very dangerous very dangerous and you know what actually
[1:01:27.940 --> 1:01:31.300]  find that there's a couple different versions of it they added some more to
[1:01:31.300 --> 1:01:41.740]  a few clubs but it's called impeach in prison kill Trump because I've got the
[1:01:41.740 --> 1:01:49.660]  headline on m4s.com deep state may assassinate Trump in Dallas tonight well
[1:01:49.660 --> 1:01:55.100]  hell they may assassinate him in DC tomorrow I mean they're saying we want
[1:01:55.100 --> 1:01:59.020]  to kill him it's all over the damn news and people in charge of those type of
[1:01:59.020 --> 1:02:08.380]  operations are saying we're gonna kill him and we're gonna kill Giuliani because
[1:02:08.380 --> 1:02:14.620]  he's investigating their big sugar tit over there in Ukraine that big corrupt
[1:02:14.620 --> 1:02:19.300]  black hole vacuum where they're engaged in all that by the way that's not a
[1:02:19.300 --> 1:02:27.100]  profane thing I said a sugar tit the old days pacifiers weren't just a little
[1:02:27.100 --> 1:02:33.460]  plop rubber piece of plastic they wrap up a little handkerchief then handkerchief
[1:02:33.460 --> 1:02:41.500]  with a sugar cube in it that's a sugar tit and that is what's going on where
[1:02:41.500 --> 1:02:45.020]  they set up these war zones the globalists do and then they pump billions
[1:02:45.020 --> 1:02:49.780]  and billions a month in aid in I mean Ukraine's gotten something like a hundred
[1:02:49.780 --> 1:02:52.620]  billion dollars last time I checked his health a trillion in Afghanistan they
[1:02:52.620 --> 1:02:57.460]  stole and then they just siphon it off but see for the diplomatic corps they
[1:02:57.460 --> 1:03:01.580]  can go into a country they control and get all the contracts because the Ukraine
[1:03:01.580 --> 1:03:05.220]  was run by Russia and the Soviet Union so it's got the bureaucracy of corruption
[1:03:05.220 --> 1:03:10.900]  in place they just step aside kick the oligarchs out who worked for the Rothschilds
[1:03:10.900 --> 1:03:13.700]  to begin with on record I mean it turned out they've lost court cases with the
[1:03:13.700 --> 1:03:16.660]  Rothschilds sued major newspapers saying that they ran the old Russian
[1:03:16.660 --> 1:03:21.140]  oligarchs turned out they did from 1917 on the Rothschilds funded overthrowing
[1:03:21.140 --> 1:03:27.220]  Russia and they ran that whole damn thing and bled off Russia for almost 80
[1:03:27.220 --> 1:03:33.660]  years that's why the globalists have a big old hard-on for Russia is because
[1:03:33.660 --> 1:03:39.460]  they were able to remove the face sucker like from alien they got the eight legs
[1:03:39.460 --> 1:03:45.540]  off their face but the the tail still around Russia's neck but the US hell
[1:03:45.540 --> 1:03:51.420]  we got like 15 face suckers on us and by the way these face suckers these
[1:03:51.420 --> 1:03:57.420]  globalists every race, color and creed that serve Satan new big article out
[1:03:57.420 --> 1:04:05.340]  right now up on info wars.com some court documents turns out they did a what
[1:04:05.340 --> 1:04:11.860]  was it a giant multi-million dollar racketeering suit against the prolifers
[1:04:11.860 --> 1:04:15.820]  that went in and signed the deals to buy body parts and living babies for
[1:04:15.820 --> 1:04:20.980]  harvesting turns out the doctors had a side business too they were selling
[1:04:20.980 --> 1:04:31.940]  scalps that leftists like to wear on belts at satanic events now how many
[1:04:31.940 --> 1:04:36.860]  times I told you they like to kill babies metaphysically as a scalp or shrunken
[1:04:36.860 --> 1:04:41.740]  head they wear around them nothing changes throughout history and I was
[1:04:41.740 --> 1:04:46.020]  just envisioning metaphysically that but it turns out these abortion doctors
[1:04:46.020 --> 1:04:52.340]  wear the scalps because it's a symbol of how they took someone's destiny in
[1:04:52.340 --> 1:04:57.240]  their life and they chopped them up and they sold their goods and they took the
[1:04:57.240 --> 1:05:01.300]  prize of their life their hair especially little girls hair and they wear
[1:05:01.300 --> 1:05:07.340]  around their belts with their buck bellies when they worship Satan my
[1:05:07.340 --> 1:05:12.660]  friends I've seen a lot of Donald Trump just like you have and my goodness
[1:05:12.660 --> 1:05:17.580]  yesterday's press conference when they came in on him with all their garbage
[1:05:17.580 --> 1:05:21.460]  the foreign reporters the u.s. reporters these little political sellouts these
[1:05:21.460 --> 1:05:26.340]  horse he just tore them to bits and it's one thing to hear it of your radio
[1:05:26.340 --> 1:05:31.500]  listeners powerful but if you see it it's all at band video you've got the full
[1:05:31.500 --> 1:05:36.300]  press conference we've got my boil down of how epic it is it's all about video
[1:05:36.300 --> 1:05:39.900]  and I just you've got to share this with people because Trump was hitting on all
[1:05:39.900 --> 1:05:44.660]  45 cylinders this was amazing and he turned the nitrous oxide on top of it
[1:05:44.660 --> 1:05:48.780]  so in full Wars America Trump all of us incredible things are happening and
[1:05:48.780 --> 1:05:54.860]  we're sharing the ideas that are gonna defeat the tyrants at band video and I
[1:05:54.860 --> 1:05:58.460]  got to tell you we've done great video work we've done great films we've done
[1:05:58.460 --> 1:06:02.620]  so much but websites are not our thing well now they are I'm so proud of band

[1:06:25.340 --> 1:06:32.580]  receiving this transmission you are the resistance from the info wars dot com
[1:06:32.580 --> 1:06:40.540]  studios it's Alex Jones all right constitutional lawyer army veteran
[1:06:40.540 --> 1:06:46.540]  former Ron Paul strategist Stuart Rhodes will be with us founder of
[1:06:46.540 --> 1:06:50.060]  Oath Keepers he already had a bad feeling about Dallas weeks ago I heard
[1:06:50.060 --> 1:06:53.900]  about this and was gonna be there with Oath Keepers security for the pro-Trump
[1:06:53.900 --> 1:06:58.100]  rally you've seen the vicious attacks on Trump rallies I'd have to say or five
[1:06:58.100 --> 1:07:04.540]  times worse than they were three years ago at this time as we plunge into 2020
[1:07:04.540 --> 1:07:08.060]  we're already heavy into the 2020 races everybody knows even though there's still
[1:07:08.060 --> 1:07:14.020]  four months left in the year October November December my goodness not even
[1:07:14.020 --> 1:07:19.420]  four months three months left time is flying by and I was sitting here this
[1:07:19.420 --> 1:07:29.020]  morning about to go live ten minutes before and I was thinking what do we
[1:07:29.020 --> 1:07:32.740]  call the headline for the live show that we post on info wars dot com and the
[1:07:32.740 --> 1:07:41.020]  live feed at band on video and Kit Daniels one of our chief writers walks in
[1:07:41.020 --> 1:07:46.780]  here and says to me I got a really bad feeling about the crew up to today I
[1:07:46.780 --> 1:07:50.340]  just got a bad feeling I said what he goes I don't know I just don't you feel
[1:07:50.340 --> 1:07:54.180]  it and we never walk around and say that I mean maybe once a year or something
[1:07:54.180 --> 1:07:57.060]  and I said you know my wife felt like this this morning and she never does
[1:07:57.060 --> 1:08:00.980]  that and tell she was even calling me up earlier I want you to come home I got a
[1:08:00.980 --> 1:08:08.540]  bad feeling we get the kids home we need to and I'm thinking well is it the
[1:08:08.540 --> 1:08:11.860]  earthquake that they said had all these big earthquakes they say they believe
[1:08:11.860 --> 1:08:16.420]  they're just tremors before the big one of that's mainline headlines that's the
[1:08:16.420 --> 1:08:20.060]  U.S. Geological Survey they're having all these big alerts I said maybe it's
[1:08:20.060 --> 1:08:23.300]  that or maybe the economy is gonna crash today or something because you know
[1:08:23.300 --> 1:08:27.540]  every time stuff like this happens every time we feel like this last time I
[1:08:27.540 --> 1:08:31.260]  felt this much dread I said it was the day they did the fake killing have been
[1:08:31.260 --> 1:08:36.940]  locked that was important because it was trying to sure up their whole 9-11
[1:08:36.940 --> 1:08:41.820]  narrative and you know staging more events and I guess because I was in so
[1:08:41.820 --> 1:08:45.900]  much danger as with Steve Pachinick had been run major operations of the CIA
[1:08:45.900 --> 1:08:49.820]  he was exposing that the years before that they had him on ice it was all
[1:08:49.820 --> 1:08:53.060]  staged and then they would you know kill a body double or whatever which we
[1:08:53.060 --> 1:08:57.180]  know is what happened with the famously political Navy SEALs nothing against Navy
[1:08:57.180 --> 1:09:02.020]  SEALs it's just that's a fact pure propaganda and then sure enough that
[1:09:02.020 --> 1:09:07.620]  happened that night and and and I had a lot of dread before 9-11 and I said I
[1:09:07.620 --> 1:09:12.860]  think they're gonna blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on bin Laden and
[1:09:12.860 --> 1:09:19.540]  I had dreams about the towers on fire I told people that went on air and said
[1:09:19.540 --> 1:09:23.660]  call the White House tell them don't blow up the World Trade Center that's all
[1:09:23.660 --> 1:09:27.700]  on record you can go to YouTube still and find where I'm there and access
[1:09:27.700 --> 1:09:31.020]  television saying it all I already had a syndicated radio show but for TV I was
[1:09:31.020 --> 1:09:34.180]  still producing things out of an access TV studio pretty nice studio still here
[1:09:34.180 --> 1:09:42.420]  in Austin and yet to go with your gut because it's beyond the gut when all
[1:09:42.420 --> 1:09:45.580]  these politicians are on TV saying they're gonna kill the president and
[1:09:45.580 --> 1:09:48.420]  saying we're gonna take him out and former CIA operatives that ran
[1:09:48.420 --> 1:09:52.420]  assassination operations like Phil Mudd say government's gonna kill this guy and
[1:09:52.420 --> 1:09:55.980]  we're gonna stab Julie on in the back and he'll soon be out of office outside
[1:09:55.980 --> 1:10:02.380]  of impeachment have they whipped themselves up into another frenzy which
[1:10:02.380 --> 1:10:07.020]  everybody can see and feel to make their move well that's not enough to go on
[1:10:07.020 --> 1:10:10.780]  air and say I think they may try to assassinate the president in Dallas
[1:10:10.780 --> 1:10:15.220]  tonight just because they're saying they want to we know there's been a bunch of
[1:10:15.220 --> 1:10:18.660]  attempts that have been stopped we know the president sends folks out to get
[1:10:18.660 --> 1:10:21.460]  him restaurant and fast foods he doesn't trust the White House kitchen
[1:10:21.460 --> 1:10:26.500]  that's come out of course they're trying this poisoning ancient Kings was
[1:10:26.500 --> 1:10:33.820]  number one way for them to die don't be naive I know you're not but when Joe
[1:10:33.820 --> 1:10:39.900]  Biden in the debate says we need to focus on removing this president and then
[1:10:39.900 --> 1:10:44.340]  he says on the 17th and he goes whoa because he's obviously losing his mental
[1:10:44.340 --> 1:10:48.940]  faculties that's why he'll say we're gonna
[1:10:48.940 --> 1:10:58.660]  tax and increase taxes on capital gains and then he says we're gonna get rid of
[1:10:58.660 --> 1:11:06.780]  it so those videos are all on info wars.com and news wars.com and you add
[1:11:06.780 --> 1:11:09.860]  that everything else happening that's why we know it's so serious the Stewart
[1:11:09.860 --> 1:11:13.940]  Rhodes joins us next segment now now let me tell you what else was in my stack
[1:11:13.940 --> 1:11:18.460]  today I did massive preparation last night this morning for the show and I
[1:11:18.460 --> 1:11:21.580]  was gonna come in here very calmly and cover every bit of this till it all
[1:11:21.580 --> 1:11:26.420]  clicked right before the show time that we're not worried about our crew in
[1:11:26.420 --> 1:11:30.500]  Dallas we're not worried my wife's not worried about me going you're not going

[1:11:47.980 --> 1:11:52.460]  you're not usually like this I mean my wife is not that type of person and then
[1:11:52.460 --> 1:11:56.260]  I'm like kid you're like my wife now freaking out worried about the crew up
[1:11:56.260 --> 1:11:59.500]  there what what I said is there's something going on that you have any
[1:11:59.500 --> 1:12:07.460]  information goes no I just and then I'm sitting there looking at info wars.com
[1:12:07.460 --> 1:12:14.460]  and hit me like a ton of bricks I go David Knight named his show today did Joe
[1:12:14.460 --> 1:12:19.940]  Biden just accidentally telegraph the date of an attempt to assassinate the
[1:12:19.940 --> 1:12:23.740]  president that's from memory you guys pulled the exact news wars boom the
[1:12:23.740 --> 1:12:28.860]  crew did it before I even called for it I just want to watch live did Biden blow
[1:12:28.860 --> 1:12:34.540]  the cover of Trump assassination plan and let me tell you David Knight said you
[1:12:34.540 --> 1:12:40.860]  know multi-degree engineer that guy doesn't say anything unless it's just
[1:12:40.860 --> 1:12:48.580]  cut and dry and he doesn't ever fill in the blanks or connect dots he just goes
[1:12:48.580 --> 1:12:53.940]  with what we know and the fact that David said that I was like oh my gosh
[1:12:53.940 --> 1:12:58.260]  that's it and you just know it I mean I just know they're gonna try to kill the
[1:12:58.260 --> 1:13:02.820]  president tonight now they may not now because we're talking about it but don't
[1:13:02.820 --> 1:13:11.340]  let anybody ever tell you not to go with your gut you know I'll just tell you all
[1:13:11.340 --> 1:13:14.940]  this other news next hour we have another great guest joining us who's been
[1:13:14.940 --> 1:13:18.980]  warning they plan to assassinate the president or remove him Steve Allen I
[1:13:18.980 --> 1:13:24.580]  heard this on Monday think about it news he's gonna be joining us he'll cover
[1:13:24.580 --> 1:13:28.580]  the waterfront with us I've got a plug door we won't be here
[1:13:28.580 --> 1:13:35.700]  seriously folks I thought about starting the broadcast today and doing a whole
[1:13:35.700 --> 1:13:39.300]  first segment on saying we have great products you need plus we need the
[1:13:39.300 --> 1:13:45.180]  funding when we had that big sale we were bringing enough money to fund
[1:13:45.180 --> 1:13:50.300]  ourselves then the sale went away and again we'll have to close our doors
[1:13:50.300 --> 1:13:53.220]  sometime late next year I don't want that to happen in the middle of the
[1:13:53.220 --> 1:13:56.900]  election you don't either and I don't want to cut back people and I don't want
[1:13:56.900 --> 1:14:00.940]  to not fight we need more reporters we need to fight harder but we certainly
[1:14:00.940 --> 1:14:05.060]  don't want to contract info wars is so critical the globalist credit us with
[1:14:05.060 --> 1:14:09.860]  relaunching the Americana grassroots populist movement worldwide we did it
[1:14:09.860 --> 1:14:14.740]  you did it when you bought the Rainforest Plus or you bought the wake of
[1:14:14.740 --> 1:14:19.140]  America coffee or you bought a t-shirt you bought a film or you got your
[1:14:19.140 --> 1:14:25.180]  water filtration and your air filtration you just you did it I'm a rocket this
[1:14:25.180 --> 1:14:28.780]  operation can get us there man but without the fuel we're not getting off
[1:14:28.780 --> 1:14:35.860]  the launch pad well here's the deal we're already 90% to our destination but
[1:14:35.860 --> 1:14:39.980]  this is the most critical part of the fight so I said you know the world's so
[1:14:39.980 --> 1:14:42.220]  crazy things are so dangerous they could kill Trump any minute I said this on
[1:14:42.220 --> 1:14:45.340]  Monday I said they could launch a total depression I said I'm gonna sell out all
[1:14:45.340 --> 1:14:51.340]  of our inventory some of it at cost so that we know we have funds at least to
[1:14:51.340 --> 1:14:57.020]  operate full blast into the middle of next year and so I did that everything
[1:14:57.020 --> 1:15:01.220]  must go mega sale because that's how the movie starts the Joker as he's holding a
[1:15:01.220 --> 1:15:03.620]  sign I'm saying everything must go which is the symbol of they want to
[1:15:03.620 --> 1:15:07.220]  destroy society and overthrow it and have a violent Illuminati uprising which
[1:15:07.220 --> 1:15:11.980]  to now the director and everybody admits to the plan I said everything must go

[1:19:23.900 --> 1:19:27.900]  power to the people but then meanwhile his tax exempt again offshore well
[1:19:27.900 --> 1:19:32.060]  Trump got that and all these other populace get it why would you throw
[1:19:32.060 --> 1:19:35.860]  away wealthy successful countries and cultures just so you can say the
[1:19:35.860 --> 1:19:39.580]  communist Chinese the David Rockefeller put in power are better than
[1:19:39.580 --> 1:19:45.300]  everybody that is a sick freakish joke and I will not stand by and watch
[1:19:45.300 --> 1:19:49.300]  humanity turned over to these people and I beg God for the strength and the
[1:19:49.300 --> 1:19:53.980]  will to have the discernment to help be part of their defeat and I've been
[1:19:53.980 --> 1:19:58.380]  saying that prayer for 20-plus years and God is delivering because God is great
[1:19:58.380 --> 1:20:03.900]  thank God for his son Jesus Christ and now let's move forward against the NW
[1:20:03.900 --> 1:20:05.940]  oh
[1:20:05.940 --> 1:20:31.860]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're
[1:20:31.860 --> 1:20:39.060]  listening to the Alex Jones show all right Stewart Rhodes is an army veteran
[1:20:39.060 --> 1:20:45.060]  good friend of mine founder of the Oathkeepers and he's also does a practice
[1:20:45.060 --> 1:20:50.340]  law now he's focused on his work heading up Oathkeepers but he's a well-known
[1:20:50.340 --> 1:20:55.060]  constitutional lawyer worked for Ron Paul he won a major award at Yale dealing
[1:20:55.060 --> 1:21:02.540]  with deep state civil war enemy combatant crises in the Republic so I mean
[1:21:02.540 --> 1:21:07.620]  even back in college his specialty is what we're dealing with now and so he
[1:21:07.620 --> 1:21:10.540]  was already scheduled yesterday for the show he's gonna be up there with
[1:21:10.540 --> 1:21:15.860]  Oathkeepers trying to provide again not offensive but defensive security for the
[1:21:15.860 --> 1:21:20.340]  Trump folks they're gonna be there who are now being attacked all over the
[1:21:20.340 --> 1:21:24.340]  country when they try to go to the Trump rallies viciously and so they're gonna
[1:21:24.340 --> 1:21:28.300]  be there tonight and I just got Stewart on and I said Stewart what do you think
[1:21:28.300 --> 1:21:32.940]  of Biden saying we need to remove Trump and we're gonna remove him on the 17th
[1:21:32.940 --> 1:21:36.700]  and what do you think of Pelosi then looking all crazy going I've got
[1:21:36.700 --> 1:21:41.300]  bullets I told Trump I have bullets on my bracelet and then Booker saying we
[1:21:41.300 --> 1:21:47.020]  got one shot to take him out Elijah Cummins dying the 17th is today that's
[1:21:47.020 --> 1:21:52.220]  Dallas he's in Dallas history doesn't just rhyme folks it repeats and then you've
[1:21:52.220 --> 1:21:55.340]  got Phil mud and all these leftists saying we're going to kill the president
[1:21:55.340 --> 1:21:58.700]  we're gonna stab Giuliani you've got all these calls for violence you've got
[1:21:58.700 --> 1:22:02.460]  Brennan and Clapper on CNN saying they're gonna remove him outside of
[1:22:02.460 --> 1:22:07.180]  impeachment well Blitzer says what does that mean they said all you'll see when
[1:22:07.180 --> 1:22:11.420]  these people say things you better take them serious so just with all the
[1:22:11.420 --> 1:22:15.180]  threats we've heard any rally he said he's the most targeted president since
[1:22:15.180 --> 1:22:21.580]  Abraham Lincoln or Lincoln or or or or or or JFK but now in this battle space
[1:22:21.580 --> 1:22:27.580]  and again my wife this morning never I've known my wife since I was getting
[1:22:27.580 --> 1:22:34.980]  divorced six and a half years yeah I've been married three and she never says
[1:22:34.980 --> 1:22:37.660]  come back don't go to work I have a bad feeling and I'm like what's going on with
[1:22:37.660 --> 1:22:42.420]  you and then I get Daniels doesn't act like that my head writer he's just like
[1:22:42.420 --> 1:22:45.780]  I got a bad feeling you might want to call the crew back I just I said he
[1:22:45.780 --> 1:22:48.900]  didn't say Trump getting killed he's got a bad feeling are you sure you want to
[1:22:48.900 --> 1:22:52.940]  in the crew up there I'm like well what is it kid I go because I'm got a bad
[1:22:52.940 --> 1:22:56.540]  feeling too now maybe it's a giant earthquake it's about to hit LA they
[1:22:56.540 --> 1:23:01.020]  say that there's all these pre tremors that are massive you know tremors that
[1:23:01.020 --> 1:23:05.020]  are four-point whatever's I mean they say the bit maybe it's something else but
[1:23:05.020 --> 1:23:08.740]  everybody knows you better start to learn to go with your gut and then they're
[1:23:08.740 --> 1:23:11.300]  openly saying they're gonna kill the president so Stuart Rhodes you're a
[1:23:11.300 --> 1:23:15.580]  smart guy constitutional lawyer patriot whole nine yards you said you're
[1:23:15.580 --> 1:23:19.740]  getting a lot of chatter as well what do you think about what's going on well
[1:23:19.740 --> 1:23:23.580]  yeah I got it I just got text messages from my retired police officers a 27
[1:23:23.580 --> 1:23:28.780]  year veteran in Texas who wrote and said I was seriously bad feeling about
[1:23:28.780 --> 1:23:34.020]  tonight unlike anything I felt since the morning before 9-11 occurred and I
[1:23:34.020 --> 1:23:37.060]  asked him to clarify that if he meant does he have a premonition about an
[1:23:37.060 --> 1:23:41.340]  assassination attempt he said yes plate the presence in search danger from the
[1:23:41.340 --> 1:23:45.700]  deep state coup plotters well in Dallas and this is you know him same thing he
[1:23:45.700 --> 1:23:49.700]  follows his gut he learned from all his all his time as a police officer to follow
[1:23:49.700 --> 1:23:54.500]  your gut so I think it's definitely you know and as you probably said before for
[1:23:54.500 --> 1:23:58.420]  paying attention to it and and bringing it up maybe that'll help keep it from
[1:23:58.420 --> 1:24:02.540]  happening but I think it's incumbent on the Paul of us to have our heads on a
[1:24:02.540 --> 1:24:06.260]  swivel there in Dallas today all of our men that are right let's put that text up
[1:24:06.260 --> 1:24:12.660]  and read it for a start yeah you said I have a seriously bad feeling about
[1:24:12.660 --> 1:24:16.700]  tonight unlike anything I felt since the morning before 9-11 occurred please
[1:24:16.700 --> 1:24:20.820]  tell the guys be super aware and careful I can't be there in person I'll be
[1:24:20.820 --> 1:24:24.500]  praying for you all as well as for our nation and president and Godspeed and
[1:24:24.500 --> 1:24:28.060]  then down below that he says that I asked him for clarification about whether
[1:24:28.060 --> 1:24:32.660]  he thinks it's an assassination attempt he said yes he said yes that's what I'm
[1:24:32.660 --> 1:24:36.440]  thinking about like the president is in serious danger from the deep state coup
[1:24:36.440 --> 1:24:42.620]  plotters while in Dallas so hopefully that will not materialize today but it's
[1:24:42.620 --> 1:24:47.540]  definitely important for us to all be our toes let me ask you this where instead
[1:24:47.540 --> 1:24:50.000]  of us being on the defense let's talk about offense just about what's
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:54.260]  happening you look at Pelosi you look at Cummings before he died today you look
[1:24:54.260 --> 1:24:58.140]  at Phil Mudd all these global scum they look like they're dying they look
[1:24:58.140 --> 1:25:02.100]  totally freaked out desperate scared is that because the really powerful deep
[1:25:02.100 --> 1:25:05.580]  state behind them is threatening them not just patriots because you know if the
[1:25:05.580 --> 1:25:08.300]  Patriots are all getting threatened to back off and not support Trump I got
[1:25:08.300 --> 1:25:12.020]  calls by very well-known prominent people close the president saying well
[1:25:12.020 --> 1:25:15.500]  we're all being threatened with jail or death we know you are as well in fact
[1:25:15.500 --> 1:25:19.500]  you're about to be targeted and are you with us still we want to make sure okay
[1:25:19.500 --> 1:25:23.060]  well okay great we're all moving forward we're not backing down I mean well the
[1:25:23.060 --> 1:25:26.860]  Democrats are getting threatened probably more even than us yeah I wouldn't
[1:25:26.860 --> 1:25:29.940]  be surprised they're all beholden to them they've you know every one of them has
[1:25:29.940 --> 1:25:33.020]  got skeletons in their closet that's why they're still where they are as they
[1:25:33.020 --> 1:25:36.580]  can be manipulated by the deep state that's holding it over their heads and
[1:25:36.580 --> 1:25:41.500]  so we're in we're in a fight for the Republic and I really feel that if we
[1:25:41.500 --> 1:25:44.900]  don't stand behind President Trump and make it clear that we're not gonna
[1:25:44.900 --> 1:25:49.660]  accept his assassination or his unlawful removal from office I think we're in deep
[1:25:49.660 --> 1:25:54.340]  due to that's why you know when he he retweeted the comment by Patrick
[1:25:54.340 --> 1:25:58.780]  Jeffries last week about civil war about a civil war like fissure in this
[1:25:58.780 --> 1:26:03.020]  country I retreated that and said yes I agree I think I think we're actually in
[1:26:03.020 --> 1:26:06.540]  a cold civil war and it's potentially gonna go hot depending upon what
[1:26:06.540 --> 1:26:10.020]  happens and that of course said all the leftists attacking me and just for
[1:26:10.020 --> 1:26:14.100]  pointing out reality but you know it's obvious that their their entire intent is
[1:26:14.100 --> 1:26:18.700]  to take him down because they see him as he's like a lightning rod they see him
[1:26:18.700 --> 1:26:23.060]  as the focal point for everything they hate which is which is one half of the
[1:26:23.060 --> 1:26:28.740]  country the conservative half the patriotic half and you can tell watching a
[1:26:28.740 --> 1:26:32.780]  dog fight or a cock fight or a bull fight or humans about to fight when
[1:26:32.780 --> 1:26:36.860]  they're really gonna strike and they've been creeping around trying wimpy moves
[1:26:36.860 --> 1:26:40.540]  and stuff before but they've already jumped they're in midair they're trying
[1:26:40.540 --> 1:26:43.940]  to take the president down you can feel it you can see it that's why there's
[1:26:43.940 --> 1:26:50.180]  such a feeling of earnestness that we all better be maximal readiness
[1:26:50.180 --> 1:26:56.980]  awareness and engaging getting the word out to try to stop this happening and I
[1:26:56.980 --> 1:27:02.700]  think showing support and you see a lot of the Senate Republicans kind of put
[1:27:02.700 --> 1:27:05.620]  their finger in the wind to see which way the wind's gonna blow and I think
[1:27:05.620 --> 1:27:09.620]  with the serious Syrian pullout like a lot of them looking at that as their
[1:27:09.620 --> 1:27:15.340]  excuse for maybe exciting with the Democrats to to impeach him so I think
[1:27:15.340 --> 1:27:19.060]  Lindsey Graham for example is is it you know very likely he's gonna turn on the
[1:27:19.060 --> 1:27:23.060]  president and use serious as excuse and this is a guy that hasn't been really
[1:27:23.060 --> 1:27:27.180]  standing up he gets on TV and talks a lot but he hasn't held any hearings he
[1:27:27.180 --> 1:27:30.740]  hasn't really done anything aggressively in the Senate to expose what's going on
[1:27:30.740 --> 1:27:34.340]  and so I don't trust him at all well the globalists have said everywhere and in
[1:27:34.340 --> 1:27:38.380]  their own white papers that they're not gonna just get Trump out and then just
[1:27:38.380 --> 1:27:42.100]  get the leadership of the patriot movement they go we're gonna level the
[1:27:42.100 --> 1:27:45.700]  entire Christian quote white they're the ones pushing race war and it's mainly
[1:27:45.700 --> 1:27:49.700]  white people saying that so that no one can ever rise up against their new old
[1:27:49.700 --> 1:27:53.340]  order again because they know it's been Western white nations that ended up
[1:27:53.340 --> 1:27:57.740]  Magna Carta freedom rights for women and the big mega corporations are
[1:27:57.740 --> 1:28:01.820]  threatened that the Western ethos may be discovered again and so if everybody
[1:28:01.820 --> 1:28:05.980]  kind of steps down and stands down and lets the globalists take over it's not
[1:28:05.980 --> 1:28:09.140]  gonna be black business like usual anymore they're going to have a reign of
[1:28:09.140 --> 1:28:14.180]  terror like in China right now like what's going on Hong Kong and look at
[1:28:14.180 --> 1:28:17.780]  the look at the way that the NBA for example is this cow telling and all
[1:28:17.780 --> 1:28:21.140]  these big corporations in the United States are cow telling to the Chinese
[1:28:21.140 --> 1:28:24.540]  that's what's gonna be like in our future so I agree with you I think that's
[1:28:24.540 --> 1:28:27.380]  why we're that's we're there in Dallas right now so we were in Minneapolis on
[1:28:27.380 --> 1:28:31.540]  the ground and also before that the Rio Rancho Trump rally we're making sure
[1:28:31.540 --> 1:28:34.820]  that you know we're out there front and center our military and police veterans
[1:28:34.820 --> 1:28:39.300]  protecting people in the street as we go back to their cars but also I think it
[1:28:39.300 --> 1:28:42.740]  helps send a message that that we're behind President Trump and we're behind
[1:28:42.740 --> 1:28:46.100]  the republic what would be more importantly to be behind him I respect
[1:28:46.100 --> 1:28:50.380]  your your your I respect your background research and doing so much security at
[1:28:50.380 --> 1:28:52.940]  these type of things I want to ask you we come back do you think I should get in
[1:28:52.940 --> 1:28:56.220]  the car and come up there or will that just add to the hysteria we'll talk to
[1:28:56.220 --> 1:28:58.740]  Stuart Rose the other side they've already said they're gonna kill the
[1:28:58.740 --> 1:29:03.660]  president or remove it okay so the question is it gonna be tonight and why

[1:34:02.460 --> 1:34:06.660]  heard them you've seen them and then you've got Biden in these cryptic

[1:34:21.220 --> 1:34:25.700]  to this hour next hour on the subject of the deep state ongoing coup against the
[1:34:25.700 --> 1:34:30.700]  president the behind the closed doors coup they're trying to have Mitch McConnell
[1:34:30.700 --> 1:34:32.940]  saying oh they they're planned to impeach him and we're gonna have the
[1:34:32.940 --> 1:34:36.780]  trial before Christmas people said well how did you know that a few weeks ago
[1:34:36.780 --> 1:34:41.580]  Pelosi put directives out the Democrats that they're going to have she said
[1:34:41.580 --> 1:34:45.580]  there's six committees we're gonna have we only got four right now operating and
[1:34:45.580 --> 1:34:50.820]  she said oh don't worry you know we'll find something that's a quote very
[1:34:50.820 --> 1:35:01.300]  bizarre statement this is so naked and we'll vote for impeachment by Thanksgiving
[1:35:01.300 --> 1:35:05.380]  and then we'll have the trial by Christmas and now Mitch McConnell prepare
[1:35:05.380 --> 1:35:12.300]  for impeachment McConnell tells GOP MSM a conald preview Senate impeachment trial
[1:35:12.300 --> 1:35:19.980]  says they'll have it done by Christmas Trump's impeachment blockade crumbles as
[1:35:19.980 --> 1:35:23.460]  witnesses agree to talk and then of course they're all making stuff up it
[1:35:23.460 --> 1:35:30.700]  turns out but as a lawyer Stuart then I'll play this clip again Biden say we
[1:35:30.700 --> 1:35:34.020]  need to remove the president and focus on removing him by the 17th that was two
[1:35:34.020 --> 1:35:37.420]  days ago then he goes like he said something he wasn't supposed to look
[1:35:37.420 --> 1:35:42.100]  like Sylvester caught with Whittybird in his mouth as a constitutional lawyer
[1:35:42.100 --> 1:35:48.220]  you're looking at how it's supposed to work in the House and Senate what what
[1:35:48.220 --> 1:35:52.300]  does it signal to you that that Pelosi came out yesterday and said well we're
[1:35:52.300 --> 1:35:57.460]  not gonna start official articles of impeachment yet because we're still
[1:35:57.460 --> 1:36:01.380]  researching well that's how they never have real investigation which there is
[1:36:01.380 --> 1:36:04.500]  no real evidence that he said the kangaroo secret committee the star
[1:36:04.500 --> 1:36:08.620]  chamber where Republicans can ask questions and so they can basically have
[1:36:08.620 --> 1:36:13.140]  a coup behind closed doors that's continuing her same objective but they
[1:36:13.140 --> 1:36:17.420]  do seem panicked and do are saying they want him out regardless not even with
[1:36:17.420 --> 1:36:21.380]  impeachment they're talking about 22nd amendment how do you see them going at
[1:36:21.380 --> 1:36:24.980]  the president well yeah I think what they're really gonna try to claim is
[1:36:24.980 --> 1:36:28.700]  that he's mentally unsound and I think what's really happening is behind the
[1:36:28.700 --> 1:36:32.340]  closed doors they're going to the senators and trying to find enough
[1:36:32.340 --> 1:36:37.020]  Republican senators like I said that's why I think the Syrian pullout is gonna
[1:36:37.020 --> 1:36:41.860]  give some of those senators and the GOP senators like Lindsey Graham their
[1:36:41.860 --> 1:36:46.300]  excuse they might say hey he's mentally unstable he's endangering our troops in
[1:36:46.300 --> 1:36:50.700]  the Middle East he's endangering world peace etc etc so I think this is really
[1:36:50.700 --> 1:36:53.540]  happening that's why they're not really having any many public hearings right
[1:36:53.540 --> 1:36:57.380]  now they're holding their cards close to their vests while they go and work on the
[1:36:57.380 --> 1:37:02.620]  back room deals about what they can get the GOP in the Senate to agree to and I
[1:37:02.620 --> 1:37:07.300]  don't trust that the these senators in the GOP at all they think they're all
[1:37:07.300 --> 1:37:10.740]  part of the same deep-state establishment so I think they're I think
[1:37:10.740 --> 1:37:14.700]  we're in for a betrayal he's gonna wind up like Caesar being betrayed by you know
[1:37:14.700 --> 1:37:17.820]  by Brutus that's what's gonna happen with him and Lindsey Graham I don't trust
[1:37:17.820 --> 1:37:21.340]  Lindsey Graham as far as I can chuck him and you can feel it you can smell it you
[1:37:21.340 --> 1:37:25.500]  can see it history is repeating I don't just say this to be alarmist folks they
[1:37:25.500 --> 1:37:29.060]  are really meaning to remove him and of course you were one of Ron Paul's head
[1:37:29.060 --> 1:37:34.780]  guys on the hill you know how this works you're not just up here as a veteran and
[1:37:34.780 --> 1:37:38.140]  as a lawyer give people your view as a guy that's written you know award-winning
[1:37:38.140 --> 1:37:42.580]  papers on history of our republic versus Rome when you talk about it that's
[1:37:42.580 --> 1:37:46.540]  because it's really happening yeah I was there actually I was there during the
[1:37:46.540 --> 1:37:50.580]  Clinton impeachment I was in his office at the time and so you know and this is
[1:37:50.580 --> 1:37:54.380]  what's different about this is that there was never a challenge to Clinton's
[1:37:54.380 --> 1:37:58.820]  mental stability and you see this repeatedly not just from Democrats
[1:37:58.820 --> 1:38:03.060]  most Republicans alleging that Trump is mentally unstable and unfit for office
[1:38:03.060 --> 1:38:07.700]  and it's gonna try to use that rationales or nuclear option to remove him
[1:38:07.700 --> 1:38:10.580]  they can do that even without impeachment they you know they could just
[1:38:10.580 --> 1:38:16.060]  have a if they could believe it's just his own his own his own staff can have
[1:38:16.060 --> 1:38:20.260]  him removed with it with the consent of the vice president and that's that that's
[1:38:20.260 --> 1:38:23.580]  what they might try to do if impeachment doesn't work formally they'll go that
[1:38:23.580 --> 1:38:29.460]  route instead well the reason I built up your bona fides is I'm asking you what
[1:38:29.460 --> 1:38:34.100]  do you think we can do to put pressure on the Senate and on the swing state
[1:38:34.100 --> 1:38:39.020]  House members those purple state members and I mean just the whole armament of
[1:38:39.020 --> 1:38:44.780]  legal lawful ways that we can really get a plane you know fly to DC go into
[1:38:44.780 --> 1:38:48.740]  their offices they're wide open to get in their face in a focus way a legal
[1:38:48.740 --> 1:38:54.700]  lawful way fly airplanes over city saying don't be the president go out and
[1:38:54.700 --> 1:38:59.060]  bullhorn Democrats houses I mean what do we do I think should focus on the on
[1:38:59.060 --> 1:39:03.020]  the Republicans I should focus on Lindsey Graham and McConnell and the other
[1:39:03.020 --> 1:39:07.660]  key Republicans in the US Senate and make sure they understand that if they
[1:39:07.660 --> 1:39:11.540]  you know across that bridge bridge too far and go along with the removal of
[1:39:11.540 --> 1:39:14.740]  President Trump and just let them know we don't care what your excuse is we
[1:39:14.740 --> 1:39:18.460]  don't care you know I personally don't like what happened to the Kurds I think
[1:39:18.460 --> 1:39:22.300]  that was a mistake and and I think it's frankly dishonorable to leave our
[1:39:22.300 --> 1:39:26.500]  allies hanging like that but it's not grounds for removal of the president he
[1:39:26.500 --> 1:39:29.700]  has the authority to pull the troops back if you don't like it then vote him
[1:39:29.700 --> 1:39:32.940]  out of office and so I think we need to send that message to Lindsey Graham and
[1:39:32.940 --> 1:39:37.180]  others in the Senate that focused on them that will stick there we'll tack
[1:39:37.180 --> 1:39:41.460]  their skin to the door will remove them from office into the next election so
[1:39:41.460 --> 1:39:45.020]  they have to be sent that that message that this is not politics as usual great
[1:39:45.020 --> 1:39:48.740]  advice don't go get an AOC's face or Pelosi's you're not gonna change their
[1:39:48.740 --> 1:39:53.180]  mind but go get in the face of the damn Republicans right the ones that that
[1:39:53.180 --> 1:39:57.340]  matter for whether or not he will be convicted in the Senate those are the
[1:39:57.340 --> 1:40:00.700]  ones you got to focus on the house is a done deal you've lost they lost the
[1:40:00.700 --> 1:40:04.980]  house a long time ago so we still have the Senate at least a name only so at
[1:40:04.980 --> 1:40:07.860]  least go there and make sure that they understand they can't do this without
[1:40:07.860 --> 1:40:13.940]  personal consequences they'll be removed from office as well that brings me back
[1:40:13.940 --> 1:40:17.380]  to what you just brought up my next question was Syria and I know you've
[1:40:17.380 --> 1:40:21.060]  been in the military you've covered it you follow these things but at a certain
[1:40:21.060 --> 1:40:24.980]  point we've got to stop being in these nations we've been there ten years we
[1:40:24.980 --> 1:40:29.060]  been in Afghanistan 19 and and I understand but Trump came out and said
[1:40:29.060 --> 1:40:32.260]  the Kurds aren't angels Rand Paul is right there's two different groups of
[1:40:32.260 --> 1:40:35.980]  Kurds they're in a civil war with each other they're fighting with you got the
[1:40:35.980 --> 1:40:40.140]  Iraqi Kurds you've got the Syrian Kurds you've got three plus million refugees
[1:40:40.140 --> 1:40:44.180]  most of which aren't even from Syria that invaded they're now in Turkey a
[1:40:44.180 --> 1:40:47.860]  bunch of them are starting to go into Europe and Erdogan called Trump up and
[1:40:47.860 --> 1:40:50.980]  said okay I've told you I'm gonna go in there if you don't let me throw them
[1:40:50.980 --> 1:40:56.100]  back in have a 20 mile exclusionary zone then I'm gonna put them in Europe and
[1:40:56.100 --> 1:40:59.780]  I'm gonna mill it up coming to the United States and then Trump goes well it is
[1:40:59.780 --> 1:41:03.260]  your border you've been in a hundred year war with the Kurds the Kurds go around
[1:41:03.260 --> 1:41:08.580]  you know plastic explosive and I mean why are we in the middle of an Arab civil
[1:41:08.580 --> 1:41:13.740]  war is my point well the thing is is we had the Kurds help us to pose Saddam
[1:41:13.740 --> 1:41:18.420]  Hussein and then they fought against ISIS in Iraq and then again in Syria that
[1:41:18.420 --> 1:41:24.220]  we've been an ally of ours for what 18 years now and so I think I lose Jim
[1:41:24.220 --> 1:41:28.860]  Hansen is the special forces retired officer that said that what should happen
[1:41:28.860 --> 1:41:33.620]  is is yes pull out but have the Kurds in a protectorate create a protectorate that
[1:41:33.620 --> 1:41:37.380]  says you know we're gonna we're gonna protect that was carved out an area for
[1:41:37.380 --> 1:41:41.340]  them yeah and that's the right way to do it do it do it that's the middle
[1:41:41.340 --> 1:41:45.900]  ground go ahead and disengage as I agree with but declare a protectorate for the
[1:41:45.900 --> 1:41:50.380]  Kurds here's the problem the Kurds do use that to go into Turkey they claim
[1:41:50.380 --> 1:41:55.260]  part of Turkey right so there is that issue but but at least at least do the
[1:41:55.260 --> 1:41:58.820]  honorable thing and say you're not gonna be able to go in there and wipe them
[1:41:58.820 --> 1:42:03.860]  out and sure but but Trump's not bad he didn't start the war he didn't go
[1:42:03.860 --> 1:42:08.020]  destabilize Syria like Obama and Hillary did with the neocons no of course he
[1:42:08.020 --> 1:42:13.100]  didn't but once again look at northern Iraq I mean you know Saddam Hussein
[1:42:13.100 --> 1:42:17.140]  gassed the Kurds with chemical weapons that he got from the United States and
[1:42:17.140 --> 1:42:21.300]  then the Kurds still fought with us against Saddam and then help depose
[1:42:21.300 --> 1:42:25.540]  him and then help fight ISIS we own that at least in Iraq at least
[1:42:25.540 --> 1:42:29.380]  cover protectorate out in Iraq I know the Army Rangers never leave their own
[1:42:29.380 --> 1:42:33.660]  behind and I'm not attacking the Kurds but my god you know much the Kurds have
[1:42:33.660 --> 1:42:37.060]  been caught training with anti-fun people they're a bunch of commies and I
[1:42:37.060 --> 1:42:40.380]  understand that you know that we've worked with them but I did some point we
[1:42:40.380 --> 1:42:44.620]  got to get out of there no and I agree but I think I think the honorable way to
[1:42:44.620 --> 1:42:48.060]  do it is like mr. Hansen said and I was not an Army Ranger just want to correct
[1:42:48.060 --> 1:42:51.460]  you on that I just said I know the Army Rangers never say leave their people
[1:42:51.460 --> 1:42:57.020]  behind yeah watch that's the ethos across the entire military yeah we we we
[1:42:57.020 --> 1:43:01.340]  we deserted the mountain arms we pulled out of Vietnam you know we have a bad
[1:43:01.340 --> 1:43:07.260]  habit in this country our political class does right now is the critical
[1:43:07.260 --> 1:43:11.620]  time to keep him full wars on the air everything we've warned of is now being
[1:43:11.620 --> 1:43:16.500]  exposed and it's out in the open want to be clear it's not coming true it was
[1:43:16.500 --> 1:43:22.060]  already true I didn't predict all this it was already going on now the globalist
[1:43:22.060 --> 1:43:26.580]  are making their move with the chai comms so it's naked it's brazen this is
[1:43:26.580 --> 1:43:30.860]  the point when the enemy emerges it's like before World War two the Poles
[1:43:30.860 --> 1:43:35.060]  kept warning that Nazi Germany was gonna attack them nobody believed them as they
[1:43:35.060 --> 1:43:39.660]  saw the troops massing until it finally happened we're at that same point and
[1:43:39.660 --> 1:43:44.020]  we're all Paul Revere's who need to be out there warning everyone about what's
[1:43:44.020 --> 1:43:48.100]  unfolding because this is the critical fight and thank God America and the
[1:43:48.100 --> 1:43:53.980]  world is waking up at the 11th hour 58 minute but will it be too little too
[1:43:53.980 --> 1:43:58.500]  late that's up to you this battle's hot it's real so spread the word and support
[1:43:58.500 --> 1:44:03.060]  info wars today info or store dot com but whatever you do spread the word
[1:44:03.060 --> 1:44:08.380]  about the live transmission I've got a really handed to the listeners and
[1:44:08.380 --> 1:44:14.100]  viewers who enforce your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a
[1:44:14.100 --> 1:44:18.300]  challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught
[1:44:18.300 --> 1:44:23.220]  hold not just here in the US worldwide and President Trump's fearlessness when
[1:44:23.220 --> 1:44:28.500]  it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well he's still
[1:44:28.500 --> 1:44:32.740]  lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some other
[1:44:32.740 --> 1:44:36.460]  areas but trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against
[1:44:36.460 --> 1:44:41.940]  China Trump's been doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have
[1:44:41.940 --> 1:44:47.260]  to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective and the globalist
[1:44:47.260 --> 1:44:51.940]  are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way and so we're
[1:44:51.940 --> 1:44:55.500]  gonna see some major fireworks out of them but it's critical to not let
[1:44:55.500 --> 1:45:00.140]  ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us that's an
[1:45:00.140 --> 1:45:04.540]  attempt to demoralize us we've got to remember that and stay focused and stay
[1:45:04.540 --> 1:45:11.620]  happy communist China quietly bought up Hollywood more than a decade ago and
[1:45:11.620 --> 1:45:15.300]  they've been approving almost all the scripts that you see on television or
[1:45:15.300 --> 1:45:20.260]  in the movies for many years and now they own our debt now they own the
[1:45:20.260 --> 1:45:24.100]  Democratic Party now they've merged with Silicon Valley to censor patriots off
[1:45:24.100 --> 1:45:28.380]  the air Washington Post comes out and says they hope that ggping the
[1:45:28.380 --> 1:45:33.340]  dictator of China will quote destroy Trump that's a headline show info wars
[1:45:33.340 --> 1:45:37.620]  has been the Paul Revere of this operation we have blown the whistle
[1:45:37.620 --> 1:45:41.420]  continuously and have been proven right and that's why it's more important than
[1:45:41.420 --> 1:45:45.620]  ever that we override Silicon Valley and their chai-kong masters by word of
[1:45:45.620 --> 1:45:49.700]  mouth and spread the word about info wars and check out info war store.com

[1:48:57.100 --> 1:49:00.140]  their own people still in the government to think hey we're the winning team we
[1:49:00.140 --> 1:49:03.740]  can win it's a confidence game they're engaged in they don't just have Phil
[1:49:03.740 --> 1:49:07.060]  mud running around I'm not killing the president killing Giuliani and others
[1:49:07.060 --> 1:49:10.180]  saying they're gonna kill him and Brennan and clapper saying he'll be gone we
[1:49:10.180 --> 1:49:13.220]  don't need impeachment and blitzer says well what do you mean they're saying
[1:49:13.220 --> 1:49:18.260]  you'll see that's meant to send a message to their stay behind networks that
[1:49:18.260 --> 1:49:22.020]  they're still in charge don't leave the sinking ship do you agree with that
[1:49:22.020 --> 1:49:27.500]  statement Stuart Rhodes yeah absolutely that's exactly what it is
[1:49:27.500 --> 1:49:33.060]  oathkeepers.org people need to visit daddy to check it out other points you'd
[1:49:33.060 --> 1:49:37.540]  like to make here Stuart yeah I think it's really important that that Trump
[1:49:37.540 --> 1:49:41.660]  supporters and just patriots in general that we stand up to all the leftist
[1:49:41.660 --> 1:49:45.780]  violence that's occurring across the country we need more volunteers in
[1:49:45.780 --> 1:49:50.740]  Minneapolis we every person we escorted not a hair on their head was harmed we
[1:49:50.740 --> 1:49:53.860]  escorted them out safely but the problem is we didn't have enough men on the
[1:49:53.860 --> 1:49:58.180]  ground to escort everybody so you see inventory of of Trump supporters being
[1:49:58.180 --> 1:50:02.340]  spit on and assaulted that didn't happen with people we're escorting but but we
[1:50:02.340 --> 1:50:05.860]  just didn't have enough guys to cover everyone there so we need more we need
[1:50:05.860 --> 1:50:09.660]  more pictures to show up and volunteer you're gonna go to the rally anyway why
[1:50:09.660 --> 1:50:14.260]  not when you get back out if you're able bodied team up with us and help escort
[1:50:14.260 --> 1:50:17.940]  people that are more vulnerable we got to make sure that we protect people and
[1:50:17.940 --> 1:50:21.020]  people should not be afraid to go to a political rally that's what I want to
[1:50:21.020 --> 1:50:24.500]  stress is we're always warning people about the dangers but I still want them
[1:50:24.500 --> 1:50:29.420]  to go so the way to cure that is to go but be ready to handle what's gonna
[1:50:29.420 --> 1:50:32.780]  what's gonna happen when we know that these leftists it's in every city
[1:50:32.780 --> 1:50:37.380]  everywhere Trump goes you have leftists who want to attack conservative attack
[1:50:37.380 --> 1:50:40.340]  Trump supporters well you were telling me that you think that I should go up
[1:50:40.340 --> 1:50:42.740]  there and I've been in some Trump rallies and it's always been very
[1:50:42.740 --> 1:50:45.940]  interesting great to meet the listeners I'd say about 70% of the Trump
[1:50:45.940 --> 1:50:49.340]  supporters are listeners it really shows you you know how important in full
[1:50:49.340 --> 1:50:52.580]  wars has been with our great listeners getting Trump in that's why they tried
[1:50:52.580 --> 1:50:56.100]  to silence us so I'm tempted to jump on an airplane today because it's in
[1:50:56.100 --> 1:51:03.140]  downtown Dallas right near Love Field the old airport there that's a 25 minute
[1:51:03.140 --> 1:51:06.300]  flight from where I sit I'm right by you know the airport here in Austin we've
[1:51:06.300 --> 1:51:10.900]  got a quick airport so we've got that's the American Airlines Center 2500
[1:51:10.900 --> 1:51:17.580]  Victory Avenue Dallas Texas and so who knows you know I think we need somebody
[1:51:17.580 --> 1:51:20.820]  to host here we've already got our crew up there but I guess Owen shroyer and
[1:51:20.820 --> 1:51:25.980]  Lee and Mackadoo and crew could do that with Rob do maybe I should get on an
[1:51:25.980 --> 1:51:28.740]  airplane I'll let folks know by the end of the show whether I'm gonna be there
[1:51:28.740 --> 1:51:32.020]  or not but that's I mean I agree with this is historic he's in Dallas there's
[1:51:32.020 --> 1:51:36.380]  all this chatter we should support the president should we yeah absolutely and
[1:51:36.380 --> 1:51:39.420]  boots on the ground is the best way to do that the more of you out there the
[1:51:39.420 --> 1:51:43.580]  better but like I said go there with the attitude that you're gonna be ready to
[1:51:43.580 --> 1:51:47.860]  defend yourselves because we know antifa is gonna be there we've got some
[1:51:47.860 --> 1:51:51.740]  information from some reliable sources let us know that they're gonna be on the
[1:51:51.740 --> 1:51:56.140]  ground and so they're gonna be there and of course you know they only attack
[1:51:56.140 --> 1:52:00.140]  people that can't defend themselves they gang up five on one or they'll find a
[1:52:00.140 --> 1:52:03.780]  woman in a wheelchair an old person when you see it with your own eyes too they
[1:52:03.780 --> 1:52:08.380]  won't mess with men they will mess with people in wheelchairs yeah that they
[1:52:08.380 --> 1:52:12.620]  never confront us directly face-to-face hasn't happened yet and they never
[1:52:12.620 --> 1:52:16.100]  confront someone who looks able-bodied able to defend himself unless they got
[1:52:16.100 --> 1:52:19.300]  10 on one but yeah they'll go for the old people they'll go for people that are
[1:52:19.300 --> 1:52:24.580]  disabled in in New Mexico we protected a guy is like 83 year old disabled
[1:52:24.580 --> 1:52:28.380]  veteran who was about to be assaulted we stopped that from happening that's what
[1:52:28.380 --> 1:52:32.420]  they target and it's despicable my problem is how when you catch them like
[1:52:32.420 --> 1:52:35.300]  the videos of them swap a woman and then the crowd sees the place I'll do
[1:52:35.300 --> 1:52:38.740]  things they start attacking how do you control yourself when they're pushing
[1:52:38.740 --> 1:52:42.500]  old ladies around or hitting women in the head you know to not attack them
[1:52:42.500 --> 1:52:45.940]  because I know you guys stop them by your presence but I just can't help it
[1:52:45.940 --> 1:52:50.580]  that's one reason I'm scared of what I'm gonna do well we nip it in the bud and
[1:52:50.580 --> 1:52:54.340]  like I said so far knock on wood we've escorted people and no one's been
[1:52:54.340 --> 1:52:58.580]  assaulted while we're escorting them now if we see someone being assaulted then
[1:52:58.580 --> 1:53:02.020]  what we're gonna be do is dive in and pull them pull them out but our focus has
[1:53:02.020 --> 1:53:05.180]  to be on just removing them from the scene and we have to stay disciplined we're
[1:53:05.180 --> 1:53:09.940]  not there to you know watch the anti-fascum waving red flags and screaming
[1:53:09.940 --> 1:53:13.860]  and cussing and they beat up a bunch of people as you know in Minnesota last
[1:53:13.860 --> 1:53:18.620]  week hundreds got physically attacked they attacked the police and yeah the
[1:53:18.620 --> 1:53:21.060]  police are just ordered to stand down and let them do it and then the media said
[1:53:21.060 --> 1:53:26.020]  oh Somalis don't feel welcome that's why gangs of Somalis came out and attacked
[1:53:26.020 --> 1:53:30.460]  the evil white people so the media is just promoting racial attacks and Sam
[1:53:30.460 --> 1:53:35.900]  Donaldson went on you know seeing it and said well the whites deserve it well
[1:53:35.900 --> 1:53:40.300]  actually we from what we saw it was mostly a wide antifa attack oh no I know
[1:53:40.300 --> 1:53:44.140]  I know it's whites attacking whites and it's whites trying to lead the race war
[1:53:44.140 --> 1:53:48.500]  but and not in the case of Minnesota sorry go ahead yeah well that's that's the
[1:53:48.500 --> 1:53:51.300]  standard across the country is mostly most these people look at this one here
[1:53:51.300 --> 1:53:54.820]  so most of these knuckleheads are actually whites there's like there's an
[1:53:54.820 --> 1:53:59.460]  occasional Somali kid that comes in sure they take it they take advantage of
[1:53:59.460 --> 1:54:03.220]  the situation they just want to beat people up you know it but it is true it
[1:54:03.220 --> 1:54:06.900]  is predominantly methad white people that are on the Soros payroll and
[1:54:06.900 --> 1:54:10.100]  literally being paid a couple hundred dollars to go do this they are the scum
[1:54:10.100 --> 1:54:15.020]  of the earth yeah a lot of methodics and and there it's their entire life is
[1:54:15.020 --> 1:54:19.740]  is to go and hang out and do meth and then go beat people up it's amazing
[1:54:19.740 --> 1:54:24.380]  Stuart Rhodes obviously those people will be there tonight there's a good chance
[1:54:24.380 --> 1:54:28.100]  that I mean see I somebody slapped my wife like that it's over I don't care
[1:54:28.100 --> 1:54:30.700]  what's a woman did it I mean I'm just gonna knock her in the head because
[1:54:30.700 --> 1:54:34.580]  you're in a man's world and again her boyfriend her husband does nothing
[1:54:34.580 --> 1:54:37.980]  story what would you do if somebody slapped your girlfriend in the face
[1:54:37.980 --> 1:54:43.460]  busted nose yeah I mean just instantly that's why I try to stay away from these
[1:54:43.460 --> 1:54:47.940]  things but yeah looks like okay should I go I guess I should probably go down

[1:55:13.420 --> 1:55:16.940]  well you know I was so prepared for the show today and I've just been
[1:55:16.940 --> 1:55:20.620]  obsessing over the coup against Trump and how they want to get him out of
[1:55:20.620 --> 1:55:23.220]  office and I think it's very serious they've told us they're gonna remove him
[1:55:23.220 --> 1:55:26.580]  they've told us they're gonna kill him so we have to take it very very serious and
[1:55:26.580 --> 1:55:31.580]  then there's so much news that I haven't gotten to I mean today was a day was I
[1:55:31.580 --> 1:55:35.420]  was like I've got to cover this this is so important and I haven't done it

[1:55:48.740 --> 1:55:58.020]  for leftist selling the scalps I've actually said on air many times that

[1:56:02.260 --> 1:56:06.380]  how in the South Pacific people would you know kill folks and shrink their heads

[2:00:15.140 --> 2:00:21.620]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're
[2:00:21.620 --> 2:00:32.180]  listening to alex jones well I saw his video Sunday and I played it on Monday
[2:00:32.180 --> 2:00:37.820]  and we set him up for the show today Steve Allen and Paul Joseph Watson takes
[2:00:37.820 --> 2:00:40.820]  over the fourth hour it was all about how the deep state plans to remove Trump
[2:00:40.820 --> 2:00:44.140]  and then he was scheduled for today and now we're in the middle of this fire
[2:00:44.140 --> 2:00:50.900]  storm Biden said they're planning to remove Trump by the 17th and then he
[2:00:50.900 --> 2:00:54.860]  caught himself and all the other cryptic statements they've said they want to
[2:00:54.860 --> 2:00:59.380]  kill the president there's a new CNN clip but they're saying it and so we
[2:00:59.380 --> 2:01:03.380]  have to take this very very very very serious that they're saying this not
[2:01:03.380 --> 2:01:09.020]  just for tonight but period what a callers think about that Alan sandy jewel
[2:01:09.020 --> 2:01:20.500]  Andrew let's go to Alan in Minnesota Alan what do you think about my
[2:01:20.500 --> 2:01:23.080]  concern and about the cryptic statements you think we're going off half
[2:01:23.080 --> 2:01:30.020]  cocktail actually no because I've been having the same feeling and I've had
[2:01:30.020 --> 2:01:35.620]  those type of feelings throughout my life just like you have and and stuff has
[2:01:35.620 --> 2:01:43.900]  always come true and I am very very worried because if they do something
[2:01:43.900 --> 2:01:51.460]  like that we very well could end up in a actual civil war and I and and I am
[2:01:51.460 --> 2:01:57.220]  afraid of that my wife she's originally from Kentucky and she's found out that
[2:01:57.220 --> 2:02:03.140]  everybody down there is ready to go with their guns already you know and what
[2:02:03.140 --> 2:02:08.220]  is she saying folks are saying in Kentucky they remove Trump that they're
[2:02:08.220 --> 2:02:14.860]  ready to go with their guns are ready to to a to a start start fighting and I am
[2:02:14.860 --> 2:02:24.140]  former military I was US Army reserve from 88 to 96 and and so you know I know
[2:02:24.140 --> 2:02:28.340]  know a little bit about how things go
[2:02:28.340 --> 2:02:32.700]  well they're saying they're saying worry they can have a quote loan not kill
[2:02:32.700 --> 2:02:37.660]  the president and or they could just drug him up and say he's had a stroke but
[2:02:37.660 --> 2:02:40.740]  there's no doubt they're in a wild frenzy you can see the globalists are
[2:02:40.740 --> 2:02:44.380]  wild-eyed right now Pelosi looked like she was having a heart attack today on
[2:02:44.380 --> 2:02:55.180]  TV Elijah Cummings is dead right and like I said from everybody she's talked
[2:02:55.180 --> 2:03:00.580]  to down in Kentucky where she's from they're all ready to go there they're
[2:03:00.580 --> 2:03:07.820]  there they're ready if something happens to him there it's not going to be an
[2:03:07.820 --> 2:03:12.820]  all-out war I'm afraid of of saying that but but that's the way it's looking to
[2:03:12.820 --> 2:03:16.060]  me and how they'll try to neutralize it into the war kicks office they'll kill
[2:03:16.060 --> 2:03:20.080]  a bunch of cops and say we did it that's why it'd be clear that police and
[2:03:20.080 --> 2:03:23.060]  military are obviously not the targets and I don't want anybody to be targets
[2:03:23.060 --> 2:03:27.500]  but it'd be upfront it's gonna be globalist corporate globalist leaders
[2:03:27.500 --> 2:03:32.060]  Democrats unfortunately are who are gonna get targeted and that's why you
[2:03:32.060 --> 2:03:35.420]  watch they all start jumping on airplanes that means they're they want
[2:03:35.420 --> 2:03:41.220]  a civil war here we want to stop that don't we yes we do but they will be I
[2:03:41.220 --> 2:03:47.060]  imagine though they're gonna get hunted down wherever they run to though right
[2:03:47.620 --> 2:03:51.740]  and you know we're not being alarmist here they're all over the news Alan
[2:03:51.740 --> 2:03:54.660]  talking about how they're gonna have a civil war how they're gonna kill Trump
[2:03:54.660 --> 2:03:57.900]  how they're gonna level us Trump supporters you know once we remove him
[2:03:57.900 --> 2:04:02.180]  we've got a really crush his supporters and imprison them and level them and
[2:04:02.180 --> 2:04:06.620]  and and don't they understand that we do the hanging I mean I'm not trying to be
[2:04:06.620 --> 2:04:09.940]  mean to the left but they can't wipe their asses and they're telling the
[2:04:09.940 --> 2:04:14.740]  productive serious people of this country who don't want to kill anybody but
[2:04:14.740 --> 2:04:19.060]  we sure know how they're there to keep poking us and poking us and poking us
[2:04:19.060 --> 2:04:23.740]  and poking us because they think they've taken our reserve as weakness they've
[2:04:23.740 --> 2:04:28.780]  taken our kindness for weakness and I really think that they are asking for
[2:04:28.780 --> 2:04:32.980]  it which I hope doesn't happen what do you think oh I hope it doesn't happen
[2:04:32.980 --> 2:04:39.460]  either but that's why I brought up Kentucky because they're fed up with it
[2:04:39.460 --> 2:04:43.700]  you know and that's why they're there that's why exactly I don't want
[2:04:43.700 --> 2:04:48.340]  anybody to start killing anybody but if they start a war if they want a war
[2:04:48.340 --> 2:04:51.460]  they're gonna get it I'm just everybody better start thinking about the tricks
[2:04:51.460 --> 2:04:55.220]  they're gonna play during that obviously we're not gonna kill any military any
[2:04:55.220 --> 2:05:00.300]  police it's gonna be the globalist and I'm not gonna kill anybody I don't
[2:05:00.300 --> 2:05:05.300]  anybody can hurt but we just better start thinking about targets I've got a
[2:05:05.300 --> 2:05:09.860]  really handed to the listeners and viewers who have been forced your support
[2:05:09.860 --> 2:05:15.060]  and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of
[2:05:15.060 --> 2:05:18.820]  corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the US but
[2:05:18.820 --> 2:05:23.060]  worldwide and President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting
[2:05:23.060 --> 2:05:28.260]  Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well you're still lacking on the big
[2:05:28.260 --> 2:05:32.940]  tech censorship taking action against that in some other areas but trying to
[2:05:32.940 --> 2:05:36.340]  end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist China
[2:05:36.340 --> 2:05:40.940]  Trump's been doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to
[2:05:40.940 --> 2:05:46.220]  realize that we're being targeted because we are effective and the globalist
[2:05:46.220 --> 2:05:50.860]  are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way and so we're
[2:05:50.860 --> 2:05:54.420]  gonna see some major fireworks out of them but it's critical to not let
[2:05:54.420 --> 2:05:59.060]  ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us that's an
[2:05:59.060 --> 2:06:03.460]  attempt to demoralize us we've got to remember that and stay focused and stay
[2:06:03.460 --> 2:06:20.460]  happy
[2:06:20.460 --> 2:06:27.060]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the

[2:06:51.580 --> 2:06:55.740]  biden two nights ago saying we want to remove trump by the 17th and he clams
[2:06:55.740 --> 2:07:00.180]  up close he's impressed i've got a bullet she wears and she's gonna stand up
[2:07:00.180 --> 2:07:05.460]  against trump and well just see it for yourself here it is my son's statement
[2:07:05.460 --> 2:07:10.500]  speaks for itself what I think is important is we focus on why it's so
[2:07:10.500 --> 2:07:16.500]  important to remove this man from office on the 17th look the fact that what I
[2:07:16.500 --> 2:07:23.780]  think is important is we focus on why it's so important to remove this man from
[2:07:23.780 --> 2:07:33.060]  office on the 17th look the fact that what I think is important is we focus on
[2:07:33.060 --> 2:07:41.740]  why it's so important to remove this man from office on the 17th look the fact
[2:07:41.740 --> 2:07:49.620]  that what I think is important is we focus on why it's so important to remove
[2:07:49.620 --> 2:07:57.060]  this man from office on the 17th look the fact that bracelets are made with
[2:07:57.060 --> 2:08:02.580]  bullets in the color orange which is the color of gun violence protection this
[2:08:02.580 --> 2:08:07.860]  I told the president we're not going away you know we've got one shot to make
[2:08:07.860 --> 2:08:11.980]  Donald Trump a one-term president as former government official government's
[2:08:11.980 --> 2:08:18.300]  gonna kill this guy well Steve Allen put out a video last weekend it's gone viral
[2:08:18.300 --> 2:08:23.580]  think about it news think about it not news and I want to just play part before
[2:08:23.580 --> 2:08:29.980]  we go to the man himself here it is the deep state Democrats are trying to take
[2:08:29.980 --> 2:08:34.060]  down America and install Hillary Clinton as president of the United States
[2:08:34.060 --> 2:08:39.580]  before the end of this year here are the steps the deep state Democrats hope to
[2:08:39.580 --> 2:08:45.900]  achieve number one fake and impeachment of President Trump and whip up media
[2:08:45.900 --> 2:08:50.700]  hysteria to gaslight the entire nation into thinking Trump is being impeached
[2:08:50.700 --> 2:08:55.940]  when it's all an act with no real vote in the house no legal bearing and no
[2:08:55.940 --> 2:09:01.100]  legitimacy step two they'll stage an arrest of President Trump vice president
[2:09:01.100 --> 2:09:05.300]  Mike Pence and his cabinet members for CNN's cameras to create the visual
[2:09:05.300 --> 2:09:11.300]  impression that Trump is guilty of something after all why is he in handcuffs
[2:09:11.300 --> 2:09:16.980]  if you've noticed already everything with the Democrats is theater everything
[2:09:16.980 --> 2:09:22.380]  is staged after that they'll swear in Nancy Pelosi as the president since
[2:09:22.380 --> 2:09:27.860]  she's next in line as the speaker of the house then Nancy Pelosi will appoint
[2:09:27.860 --> 2:09:32.980]  Hillary Clinton as her vice president then Nancy will resign as president
[2:09:32.980 --> 2:09:38.380]  making the VP now Hillary Clinton the president step six Hillary Clinton then
[2:09:38.380 --> 2:09:42.940]  appoints a new vice president possibly John Brennan to strengthen the deep
[2:09:42.940 --> 2:09:47.740]  state within her administration from that point on the mass arrest and
[2:09:47.740 --> 2:09:53.020]  executions of all Trump supporters gets authorized by President Hillary and all
[2:09:53.020 --> 2:09:57.580]  businesses and individuals who don't comply with the authoritarian Clinton
[2:09:57.580 --> 2:10:02.260]  police state will be literally imprisoned in gulags or executed by
[2:10:02.260 --> 2:10:05.780]  Clinton's death squads which already have plenty of experience from Bill
[2:10:05.780 --> 2:10:11.060]  Clinton's Arkansas days this is how it can all be accomplished before the end
[2:10:11.060 --> 2:10:16.300]  of this year if the Democrats manage to succeed in their insidious deceptive
[2:10:16.300 --> 2:10:21.740]  plans before an American public that has been lied to from the beginning of
[2:10:21.740 --> 2:10:25.180]  course the Democrats may be forgetting very important things that will prevent
[2:10:25.180 --> 2:10:29.580]  their plan from succeeding Trump is the commander-in-chief and can order the
[2:10:29.580 --> 2:10:34.420]  military police to arrest deep-state traitors and hold them for military
[2:10:34.420 --> 2:10:38.900]  tribunals the US Supreme Court now leans conservative and would likely hold
[2:10:38.900 --> 2:10:44.500]  emergency hearings on any such attempt by the Democrats tens of millions of
[2:10:44.500 --> 2:10:48.580]  armed Americans simply won't put up with a political coup run by deep state
[2:10:48.580 --> 2:10:52.980]  Democrats over one million pro-trump biker that's part of the video is
[2:10:52.980 --> 2:10:58.500]  America done with Steve Allen he joins us for the balance the hour I know we
[2:10:58.500 --> 2:11:02.140]  also have Sandy Jewel Andrew and a bunch of collars with your text will get to you
[2:11:02.140 --> 2:11:10.020]  as well but going back now to this gentleman who joins us live your analysis
[2:11:10.020 --> 2:11:13.860]  is spot-on and that's one of the tracks they're on they admit to removing they've
[2:11:13.860 --> 2:11:18.060]  also said Brendan and Clapper on CNN they could just remove him outside of even
[2:11:18.060 --> 2:11:22.700]  that and they go and no impeachment no we'll just you know kill him and then
[2:11:22.700 --> 2:11:26.380]  Phil Mudd others have said no we're gonna kill him and I think more and more
[2:11:26.380 --> 2:11:31.300]  they're balancing both because they're panicking so much Trump's also promised
[2:11:31.300 --> 2:11:34.900]  to get us out of these endless wars so they've ignited a bunch of crises there
[2:11:34.900 --> 2:11:39.700]  they've released ISIS Trump's exposed that he has the intel he says oh I think
[2:11:39.700 --> 2:11:43.060]  later you learn out he actually knew he's just not releasing that info we
[2:11:43.060 --> 2:11:47.260]  know he's authorized to as a president but it's just an amazing time I'm not
[2:11:47.260 --> 2:11:50.500]  saying he'll be assassinated in Dallas tonight but in this climate it's
[2:11:50.500 --> 2:11:54.580]  reasonable to say they may try because they've said they want to they have a
[2:11:54.580 --> 2:11:59.460]  history of it and history does repeat this is Dallas and Biden made that
[2:11:59.460 --> 2:12:04.580]  cryptic 17th statement that needs to be gone by the 17th and then look like he
[2:12:04.580 --> 2:12:08.060]  said something it wasn't supposed to so Steve thanks for joining us what do you
[2:12:08.060 --> 2:12:14.340]  think is really going on here Alex it's great to be with you on such a day like
[2:12:14.340 --> 2:12:20.260]  this it's just mind-blowing to see the desperation of evil and and that's what
[2:12:20.260 --> 2:12:24.780]  it really is it's the people that literally follow the satanic leading of
[2:12:24.780 --> 2:12:30.660]  this neocon you know globalist government that we've had in our in our
[2:12:30.660 --> 2:12:35.420]  government for years and years and most people don't have a clue and that is one
[2:12:35.420 --> 2:12:39.780]  of the reasons they've done everything they can to shut your voice they want
[2:12:39.780 --> 2:12:46.380]  Alex Jones off the air because the truth is being spoken the truth is
[2:12:46.380 --> 2:12:49.740]  getting out there to people who are listening and this is why they want you
[2:12:49.740 --> 2:12:53.140]  gone and you know that I mean I've heard you say it several times and you're
[2:12:53.140 --> 2:13:00.140]  right you are absolutely right they want all Americans to silence but as the
[2:13:00.140 --> 2:13:03.180]  truth comes out more and more people if something happens to us happens to you
[2:13:03.180 --> 2:13:07.620]  we'll just fill fill that void but why are they so desperate why are they so
[2:13:07.620 --> 2:13:12.340]  frantic now like a bunch of gremlins on PCP running around the deck of a
[2:13:12.340 --> 2:13:19.220]  sinking ship I think they've got some marching orders from the the head in
[2:13:19.220 --> 2:13:23.180]  the heavenlies in the power of the prince of the air Satan I believe they've
[2:13:23.180 --> 2:13:27.940]  got some orders from him to step it up step it up this is important the
[2:13:27.940 --> 2:13:32.020]  globalist the Luciferians you know these people that you know the mainstream
[2:13:32.020 --> 2:13:35.580]  media will never talk about and the people that most you know unfortunately
[2:13:35.580 --> 2:13:40.980]  most Americans don't have a clue they really don't they look like wild horses
[2:13:40.980 --> 2:13:45.180]  with foam coming out their mouths dragging a heavy load up a mountain like
[2:13:45.180 --> 2:13:49.380]  they're about to die and then and then there's somebody spiritually with a bull
[2:13:49.380 --> 2:13:53.660]  just splitting open their flesh to make them complete the mission these are
[2:13:53.660 --> 2:13:58.820]  slaves when we look at Pelosi and Obama and Hillary these are slaves yeah they
[2:13:58.820 --> 2:14:03.820]  are they are slaves they are totally in bondage to what Satan wants to do because
[2:14:03.820 --> 2:14:08.420]  these are people that have rejected the truth and the Bible is very clear that
[2:14:08.420 --> 2:14:14.300]  those who reject the love of the truth and the love of truth we used to see
[2:14:14.300 --> 2:14:17.620]  that at football games all the time you see these guys holding big signs of John
[2:14:17.620 --> 2:14:22.620]  3 16 that's what the love of the truth is that Christ came and died on a cross
[2:14:22.620 --> 2:14:29.860]  gave himself for us to save us to give us the remission of our sins because
[2:14:29.860 --> 2:14:32.740]  that's our sin nature that's what they're born with and these people in
[2:14:32.740 --> 2:14:36.860]  government they are born with that sin nature sin nature and they've never ever
[2:14:36.860 --> 2:14:40.820]  given their lives to Christ and they refuse to there this is the difference
[2:14:40.820 --> 2:14:44.500]  between a person who has a chance and a person who will never have a chance
[2:14:44.500 --> 2:14:50.540]  those who refuse blatantly refuse to say no I'm gonna follow the devil and money
[2:14:50.540 --> 2:14:55.900]  is my God and that's really their God Washington is nothing more than a bunch
[2:14:55.900 --> 2:15:00.020]  of worshipers of that's why they're so empty and why why are they selling out
[2:15:00.020 --> 2:15:03.500]  because they're so blind they've turned over to it and you look at Bob Dylan at
[2:15:03.500 --> 2:15:06.420]  least he admits it that he follows the chief master and commander of this
[2:15:06.420 --> 2:15:12.300]  world how sad how very very sad Bob says that and he he's saying that song you
[2:15:12.300 --> 2:15:15.420]  know you got to serve somebody who's right you do have to serve somebody and
[2:15:15.420 --> 2:15:19.740]  whether you realize it or not if you've rejected Christ you are serving the
[2:15:19.740 --> 2:15:23.900]  devil you say well no I'm my own man you know listen this isn't a song by
[2:15:23.900 --> 2:15:26.980]  Frank Sinatra you did it your way you think you're doing it your way but
[2:15:26.980 --> 2:15:31.780]  you're not you're serving the one the Prince of Darkness the one who they
[2:15:31.780 --> 2:15:35.380]  call the Prince of Light and this is the thing boy I'll tell you when the
[2:15:35.380 --> 2:15:38.980]  Antichrist comes on the scene which is not far behind and I think that's one
[2:15:38.980 --> 2:15:42.820]  of the reasons they're trying to push this up is because the Antichrist wants
[2:15:42.820 --> 2:15:47.980]  to come on the scene but he can't until like the Bible says until he who now
[2:15:47.980 --> 2:15:54.500]  restrains is removed or taken out of the way let's talk about that with Steve

[2:20:36.460 --> 2:20:49.420]  a lot of you probably noticed that everything I've talked about that like
[2:20:49.420 --> 2:20:53.140]  Mike Adams has talked about the people that have been really focused on the
[2:20:53.140 --> 2:20:57.340]  attempt the deep state to take over that now Trump's repeating it word-for-word
[2:20:57.340 --> 2:21:02.420]  well that's because that's actually what's happening and the deep state is
[2:21:02.420 --> 2:21:07.180]  publicly out there trying to act powerful and in charge to its own
[2:21:07.180 --> 2:21:15.500]  minions so that they will believe that they're in control and we'll move
[2:21:15.500 --> 2:21:19.020]  forward with the plan to remove Trump you see populist being elected
[2:21:19.020 --> 2:21:23.780]  everywhere and I liken it to someone caught in a riptide getting some air
[2:21:23.780 --> 2:21:28.060]  and then being pulled under again and I think Trump and all of this is God
[2:21:28.060 --> 2:21:31.660]  giving everybody a reset point to really see how all this is real the world
[2:21:31.660 --> 2:21:36.900]  government the human animal clones the secret experimentation that drugs report
[2:21:36.900 --> 2:21:41.580]  commas link to today one of an article we posted all of this craziness and then
[2:21:41.580 --> 2:21:45.500]  all this evil is going to come out and that many people are going to choose to
[2:21:45.500 --> 2:21:49.780]  say no to it but many others are going to choose to accept it
[2:21:49.780 --> 2:21:56.700]  there's an article out from court in San Francisco a number of years ago they
[2:21:56.700 --> 2:22:01.380]  even got arrested and they got that stuff got dropped but they did a
[2:22:01.380 --> 2:22:04.700]  racketeering lawsuit against the Christian group that went under cover
[2:22:04.700 --> 2:22:08.460]  where they were selling body parts well they're not plea bargaining they're
[2:22:08.460 --> 2:22:12.180]  going ahead with the trial and now that evidence is coming out that the doctors
[2:22:12.180 --> 2:22:18.060]  were reportedly selling scalps of babies so see I've always said they want to
[2:22:18.060 --> 2:22:23.660]  kill babies like people would take scalps well now you learn that that's
[2:22:23.660 --> 2:22:28.180]  literally going on we keep the babies comfortable though don't worry so that's
[2:22:28.180 --> 2:22:31.700]  part of this and you see mass suicide increasing in young people and in
[2:22:31.700 --> 2:22:34.700]  veterans there's articles out today on that that I'm gonna hit briefly next
[2:22:34.700 --> 2:22:38.660]  segment then take your calls where I show you the serotonin reuptake
[2:22:38.660 --> 2:22:43.780]  inhibitor inserts for things like Lou Vox and Pax on all of it it says makes you
[2:22:43.780 --> 2:22:49.180]  commit suicide the life expectancy of the average Americans going down we have
[2:22:49.180 --> 2:22:54.220]  the worst infant mortality rate in the industrial world why because we're cursed
[2:22:54.220 --> 2:22:58.900]  we had the blessing so evil came and took us over to a great extent and now
[2:22:58.900 --> 2:23:04.940]  there's a battle for the future of the world being decided in America going
[2:23:04.940 --> 2:23:11.740]  back to Steve Allen from think about it dot news what do you think about what
[2:23:11.740 --> 2:23:15.500]  Biden said what do you think about these statements film out on TV saying we're
[2:23:15.500 --> 2:23:22.060]  gonna kill the president well I think we know that that is their desire that is
[2:23:22.060 --> 2:23:29.860]  exactly what's in their evil heart because President Trump he is a miracle
[2:23:29.860 --> 2:23:35.380]  politician he's not even a politician he's a miracle elected official it was a
[2:23:35.380 --> 2:23:41.180]  miracle I have no doubt I have I have I have thought this from day one that it
[2:23:41.180 --> 2:23:46.540]  would be if he got elected and one of the videos I did early on was about
[2:23:46.540 --> 2:23:51.020]  Trump and about him building the wall and the parallel that was in the Bible and
[2:23:51.020 --> 2:23:57.740]  that just that just that really catapulted my channel and this this this
[2:23:57.740 --> 2:24:03.940]  man has been chosen by God and he got there from the prayers of all the people
[2:24:03.940 --> 2:24:07.500]  all the saints now I'm not saying all the church I'm saying the saints and the
[2:24:07.500 --> 2:24:11.300]  saints are people who are real Christians they're not the the Sunday guys
[2:24:11.300 --> 2:24:14.460]  they're not the ones who you know go there and listen to a thing and raise
[2:24:14.460 --> 2:24:17.900]  their hands with all the the flashy music and the lights and everything and
[2:24:17.900 --> 2:24:20.740]  then you know the rest of the week they live like hell they live just like the
[2:24:20.740 --> 2:24:25.540]  politicians and they ignore everything going on in the world and partly the
[2:24:25.540 --> 2:24:31.780]  church I blame Alex the church in large part for the babies who have lost their
[2:24:31.780 --> 2:24:37.060]  lives over several decades now ever since Roe v Wade so we're talking way back
[2:24:37.060 --> 2:24:41.940]  and they sat back they did nothing they were not vocal they did not elect
[2:24:41.940 --> 2:24:45.980]  politicians open the door for every other evil corruption to come in and
[2:24:45.980 --> 2:24:50.460]  now we learn every day progressively that the operating system of the
[2:24:50.460 --> 2:24:54.340]  Democrats is Satanism I mean mainline Democrats we go out to their events they
[2:24:54.340 --> 2:24:57.300]  go hey we love Satan and they're not just doing it to freak us out we send
[2:24:57.300 --> 2:25:01.540]  reporters in with other Mike flags other reporters that aren't known and they
[2:25:01.540 --> 2:25:06.340]  that is their operating system now yeah and tell me how that's acceptable in
[2:25:06.340 --> 2:25:10.620]  America how how did that ever come to the place where it's acceptable I know
[2:25:10.620 --> 2:25:14.260]  what happened before Obama but we had eight years of a man who basically
[2:25:14.260 --> 2:25:22.220]  reshaped the mindset and the thinking of a country the things were not right
[2:25:22.220 --> 2:25:26.580]  that black was white white was black and you know everybody was so politically
[2:25:26.580 --> 2:25:30.900]  correct then they were so afraid because we don't want to dare say anything
[2:25:30.900 --> 2:25:34.420]  because he's a black man he's an African-American he's black and we don't
[2:25:34.420 --> 2:25:39.620]  dare challenge anything that's not an excuse to allow evil and to be
[2:25:39.620 --> 2:25:43.300]  complicit well you can see the total you can see the total setup and I totally
[2:25:43.300 --> 2:25:46.740]  agree with you let's play clip of Trump when he talked about I'm the chosen one
[2:25:46.740 --> 2:25:50.980]  not chosen like a Messiah but he says you know his supporters you know I've
[2:25:50.980 --> 2:25:55.220]  been chosen in this time to say no to China and and and to say no and to
[2:25:55.220 --> 2:25:59.540]  finally say hey I said we're gonna end these wars that aren't our wars and I'm
[2:25:59.540 --> 2:26:02.940]  gonna finally say no the deal causes there's never a war that can stop there's
[2:26:02.940 --> 2:26:06.620]  never anything and presidents have become kept creatures the last president
[2:26:06.620 --> 2:26:12.780]  tried to in Vietnam his name was JFK he died in Dallas here's the president I am
[2:26:12.780 --> 2:26:18.540]  the chosen one somebody had to do it so I'm taking on China I'm taking on China
[2:26:18.540 --> 2:26:23.860]  on trade and you know what we're winning because we're the piggy bank we're the
[2:26:23.860 --> 2:26:28.500]  one that all these countries including the European Union wants to rob and
[2:26:28.500 --> 2:26:35.980]  takes advantage of European Union $200 billion China more than 500 all right
[2:26:35.980 --> 2:26:39.460]  we're gonna go to Sandy and Jewel and Ranger and Julie when we come back but
[2:26:39.460 --> 2:26:45.020]  we've got the minerals with the heads up think about it. News Steve Allen and Steve
[2:26:45.020 --> 2:26:49.260]  Allen again as a Christian musician in Southern California he let a trade
[2:26:49.260 --> 2:26:53.780]  support his family in Florida and moved into radio in the late 90s the co-host
[2:26:53.780 --> 2:26:57.060]  his morning show he then decided to learn Internet marketing goes off their
[2:26:57.060 --> 2:27:00.980]  website design think about it began as an online radio show with the two former
[2:27:00.980 --> 2:27:04.900]  radio guys who brought the latest issues and news he does a great job think about
[2:27:04.900 --> 2:27:09.700]  it is all about you hearing the facts and breaking from the lies to make your
[2:27:09.700 --> 2:27:14.420]  own reasonable choices we know the polls are fake we know they over simple
[2:27:14.420 --> 2:27:19.140]  over sample Democrats 15 points Trump is wildly popular I think the evidence
[2:27:19.140 --> 2:27:23.940]  shows but they just keep trying to make it so he's unpopular but if they do
[2:27:23.940 --> 2:27:29.780]  remove him if they do kill him that's gonna be a spectacular explosion they're
[2:27:29.780 --> 2:27:33.740]  not gonna be able to control and I I know these are just minions of Satan
[2:27:33.740 --> 2:27:37.220]  they're doing this I don't think they understand a larger plan now you're
[2:27:37.220 --> 2:27:40.660]  right they don't know the larger plan if they did they wouldn't be doing what
[2:27:40.660 --> 2:27:44.180]  they're doing of course they wouldn't be you know in politics probably either
[2:27:44.180 --> 2:27:48.260]  because you know you can always count on maybe two hands all the politicians we
[2:27:48.260 --> 2:27:53.580]  have in Washington that really you know that they are not only for Trump but
[2:27:53.580 --> 2:27:56.860]  they're for America they're actually they they're there to try to represent the
[2:27:56.860 --> 2:28:01.420]  people of America and I know who they are you know who they are and they
[2:28:01.420 --> 2:28:06.420]  actually try to get the truth out but you know you you're talking about such a
[2:28:06.420 --> 2:28:12.700]  mind-melting of people and mainstream media they have been the largest and
[2:28:12.700 --> 2:28:18.380]  most powerful tool in accomplishing these lies drilled into people's minds and
[2:28:18.380 --> 2:28:21.860]  it's like you know it's just like the people that you see you know Caitlyn
[2:28:21.860 --> 2:28:24.700]  Bennett interview Owen Shroyer the people that you've got in your staff Alex
[2:28:24.700 --> 2:28:28.980]  they go out and they interview people and these people are so dumbed down and so
[2:28:28.980 --> 2:28:35.220]  programmed that they just don't understand anything they really don't

[2:33:28.820 --> 2:33:39.500]  from Austin Texas it's Alex Jones and we're authentic we're organic we're
[2:33:39.500 --> 2:33:44.060]  grassroots and we are the resistance to the globalist but they don't know what
[2:33:44.060 --> 2:33:48.580]  to do except bully us and try to dominate us and that's why it's important
[2:33:48.580 --> 2:33:52.300]  to stand against them ladies and gentlemen we're at least five of our
[2:33:52.300 --> 2:33:59.500]  crew up in Dallas tonight if Trump is an assassin in which I hope obviously you
[2:33:59.500 --> 2:34:03.460]  know doesn't happen that doesn't mean there's not a danger it doesn't mean
[2:34:03.460 --> 2:34:07.540]  that our exposing the cryptic statements of Joe Biden and others didn't stop it
[2:34:07.540 --> 2:34:12.420]  if we don't realize how dangerous things are if we don't point it out it will
[2:34:12.420 --> 2:34:15.420]  allow them to continue this climate and actually get away with it but if we
[2:34:15.420 --> 2:34:18.980]  admit how much trouble we're in we have a good chance of stopping it and again
[2:34:18.980 --> 2:34:22.620]  here's a compilation of Biden at the debate and I repeat it several times
[2:34:22.620 --> 2:34:28.380]  with a subredor film here it is my son's statement speaks for itself what I
[2:34:28.380 --> 2:34:33.540]  think is important is we focus on why it's so important to remove this man from
[2:34:33.540 --> 2:34:42.180]  office on the 17 look the fact that what I think is important is we focus on why
[2:34:42.180 --> 2:34:50.300]  it's so important to remove this man from office on the 17 look the fact that
[2:34:50.300 --> 2:34:58.020]  what I think is important is we focus on why it's so important to remove this
[2:34:58.020 --> 2:35:07.060]  man from office on the 17 look the fact that what I think is important is we
[2:35:07.060 --> 2:35:16.220]  focus on why it's so important to remove this man from office on the 17 look the
[2:35:16.220 --> 2:35:21.020]  fact that bracelets are made with bullets in the color orange which is the
[2:35:21.020 --> 2:35:26.620]  color of gun violence protection this I told the president we're not going away
[2:35:26.620 --> 2:35:31.780]  you know we've got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president as
[2:35:31.780 --> 2:35:36.700]  former government official government's gonna kill this guy so it's very
[2:35:36.700 --> 2:35:40.860]  reasonable to take those statements then there's so many others I could play
[2:35:40.860 --> 2:35:44.860]  hours of it literally as you know here's another one that's new on info wars.com
[2:35:44.860 --> 2:35:49.300]  CNN supervisor wishes for Trump death this is one of the new things project
[2:35:49.300 --> 2:35:52.260]  veritas is about today it's Paul Joseph Watson article he'll be hosting the
[2:35:52.260 --> 2:35:59.380]  fourth hour revealing comments caught on tape the clip of CNN Field production
[2:35:59.380 --> 2:36:05.340]  supervisor Gerald Cisneti is discussing CNN's obsession with covering Trump all
[2:36:05.340 --> 2:36:09.100]  the time remarking this is a story that's not going to go away here's the
[2:36:09.100 --> 2:36:25.300]  clip remember when CNN everybody freaked out about the CNN meme of Trump
[2:36:25.300 --> 2:36:31.140]  beating up CNN as a pro wrestler well this is what they're really thinking it's
[2:36:31.140 --> 2:36:35.020]  what they're really doing Steve Allen from think about it.news again if you
[2:36:35.020 --> 2:36:40.100]  just tuned in on Alex Jones with info wars what do you think we can do other
[2:36:40.100 --> 2:36:44.140]  than praying and I literally have been thinking about what we can do and it hit
[2:36:44.140 --> 2:36:48.940]  me the other night well it is pray but it's not just pray it's ask God into us
[2:36:48.940 --> 2:36:53.500]  and then take action and then get in the streets and go to DC and talk to the
[2:36:53.500 --> 2:36:58.980]  Republicans that are you know somewhat purple and it's about standing up and
[2:36:58.980 --> 2:37:03.860]  getting involved in informing others what else do you think we can do well
[2:37:03.860 --> 2:37:08.740]  you hit the nail on the head Alex if the Holy Spirit is not living in you
[2:37:08.740 --> 2:37:14.860]  you're not a Christian it's that simple so you have no power to pray if you're
[2:37:14.860 --> 2:37:19.660]  not a believer in Jesus Christ so there's no sense in I mean I would just
[2:37:19.660 --> 2:37:23.020]  tell everybody to pray you can pray if you want to but guess what it's the
[2:37:23.020 --> 2:37:28.180]  people of God that he listens to it's the people who have received the love of
[2:37:28.180 --> 2:37:34.380]  the truth into their hearts who he hears it's his people who he listens to and I
[2:37:34.380 --> 2:37:38.580]  can tell you that in spite of everything that the globalist want done
[2:37:38.580 --> 2:37:43.180]  Nancy and Biden and everybody else in spite of everything they want to do
[2:37:43.180 --> 2:37:47.380]  and they've wanted to do for the last three and a half years you know it
[2:37:47.380 --> 2:37:52.940]  hasn't happened has it and it's not going to happen tonight either it's not
[2:37:52.940 --> 2:37:59.060]  going to happen tonight because God will stop it he will thwart it just like
[2:37:59.060 --> 2:38:03.340]  he's thwarted every other attack you know we don't really know how many attacks
[2:38:03.340 --> 2:38:07.940]  the president has had on his life do we we don't know that we never will know
[2:38:07.940 --> 2:38:14.580]  that but I'm sure they've tried many times before and he's still here and we
[2:38:14.580 --> 2:38:18.420]  also know behind the scenes they're having their power removed it's being
[2:38:18.420 --> 2:38:22.220]  dissipated that's why they're so upset Trump is making real changes on the
[2:38:22.220 --> 2:38:26.340]  surface and below let's talk to Ranger in Texas and Julie Sandy and Jewel
[2:38:26.340 --> 2:38:33.140]  Ranger you're on the air go ahead well thank you for taking my call first you
[2:38:33.140 --> 2:38:36.580]  know that bad feeling you got in your gut could have something to do with the
[2:38:36.580 --> 2:38:40.820]  dollar just took a nose dive this morning I saw that guys pull up dollar a
[2:38:40.820 --> 2:38:45.820]  dollar nose diver dollar and click nose go ahead yeah trading view probably has
[2:38:45.820 --> 2:38:49.340]  about the best place to look for it you know I trade currency in the morning and
[2:38:49.340 --> 2:38:54.260]  we've been waiting for months for the dollar to turn and George Soros can
[2:38:54.260 --> 2:38:59.620]  to comment oh about two weeks ago on his anticipation that the dollar can't
[2:38:59.620 --> 2:39:05.420]  hold its ground for much longer and I remember that guys type in Soros says
[2:39:05.420 --> 2:39:09.100]  the dollar can't hold its ground or Soros says the dollar in trouble I saw
[2:39:09.100 --> 2:39:15.660]  that right and so and the turn that it made isn't going to be a daily turn you
[2:39:15.660 --> 2:39:19.780]  know we're not talking about something for today and tomorrow this this could
[2:39:19.780 --> 2:39:24.780]  be something that drags down the economy not saying well but generally when
[2:39:24.780 --> 2:39:28.420]  the dollar starts to go down shortly thereafter the stock market starts to
[2:39:28.420 --> 2:39:31.500]  follow or it could be the big earthquake you know they've had all these big
[2:39:31.500 --> 2:39:35.860]  tremors that are like four-point you name it and I mean it's way overdue
[2:39:35.860 --> 2:39:39.140]  Southern California for a mega massive earthquake it could be that as well but
[2:39:39.140 --> 2:39:45.980]  everybody I know says they really feel on edge right right well I mean you know
[2:39:45.980 --> 2:39:49.700]  you look at it from the perspective of 2008 you know with the last time
[2:39:49.700 --> 2:39:54.220]  something like this happened your dollar collapsed you know everybody lost a lot
[2:39:54.220 --> 2:39:59.460]  of money and their exchanges and they did that to make sure Obama got in right
[2:39:59.460 --> 2:40:03.780]  well this time you know this is this is about on cue isn't it I mean we're not
[2:40:03.780 --> 2:40:08.660]  that far away from the election and there are very few you know collective
[2:40:08.660 --> 2:40:12.220]  bodies of people that would have the money to influence the market certainly
[2:40:12.220 --> 2:40:16.740]  Soros with the people that he knows probably has the influence to push it
[2:40:16.740 --> 2:40:21.300]  in a given direction with the assets that we've heard from the Hollywood we
[2:40:21.300 --> 2:40:25.020]  want to crash the economy to teach Americans that they will not run their
[2:40:25.020 --> 2:40:29.180]  own country and to teach him to hate Trump that is an excellent point Ranger
[2:40:29.180 --> 2:40:35.620]  you got any comments on the Steve no I think that as far as the economy we know
[2:40:35.620 --> 2:40:39.860]  the economy is gonna hit a bad place in the future I don't think it's gonna
[2:40:39.860 --> 2:40:45.180]  happen right now that's my personal opinion but I think that once things
[2:40:45.180 --> 2:40:51.900]  break apart either either the president starts to bring these people before and
[2:40:51.900 --> 2:40:56.100]  indict them and and we see some we we're gonna see a change and we're gonna see
[2:40:56.100 --> 2:40:59.180]  something happen to these people that have been running and having their way
[2:40:59.180 --> 2:41:04.100]  with evil in our government for decades something's got to break something
[2:41:04.100 --> 2:41:08.660]  decisive we need a catalyst and I think that's just on the way the middle of a
[2:41:08.660 --> 2:41:14.540]  war Ranger any other points not really thanks for what you do Alex thanks for

[2:41:41.180 --> 2:41:44.940]  just over the mountains I mean we sell for about four five dollars less than
[2:41:44.940 --> 2:41:47.900]  they usually do it it plays like Whole Foods so I mean yeah that's why it's so

[2:41:55.260 --> 2:42:01.140]  we sell a ton of it but we only make I think like five dollars per bag and that
[2:42:01.140 --> 2:42:03.980]  doesn't fund this operation seven with toothpaste 50% off we make like two
[2:42:03.980 --> 2:42:07.340]  dollars per tube fluoride-free little silver iodine fortified in full war

[2:42:26.860 --> 2:42:30.860]  all sorts of diseases and the system knows it that the communists around the
[2:42:30.860 --> 2:42:34.820]  world put it in their populations stuff because they want them to be able to be
[2:42:34.820 --> 2:42:39.220]  good you know healthy people because they've already taken them over well

[2:43:03.460 --> 2:43:08.580]  the globalists have been planning to make their move on America for decades and
[2:43:08.580 --> 2:43:12.540]  decades Hillary was supposed to get in and complete the takeover the censorship
[2:43:12.540 --> 2:43:16.940]  all of it that's why they took me off the air first and banned me across the
[2:43:16.940 --> 2:43:21.180]  internet because they knew that what we were saying was dead on and they didn't

[2:44:10.340 --> 2:44:14.300]  say a thousand times that there's no way you're gonna have an authoritarian
[2:44:14.300 --> 2:44:17.340]  corporate world government above the law but doesn't pay taxes that has
[2:44:17.340 --> 2:44:21.020]  diplomatic immunity that runs around saying it's communist and socialist
[2:44:21.020 --> 2:44:25.060]  power to the people but then meanwhile his tax exempt again offshore well
[2:44:25.060 --> 2:44:29.180]  Trump got that and all these other populace get it why would you throw
[2:44:29.180 --> 2:44:33.020]  away wealthy successful countries and cultures just so you could say the
[2:44:33.020 --> 2:44:36.740]  communist Chinese the David Rockefeller put in power are better than
[2:44:36.740 --> 2:44:42.420]  everybody that is a sick freakish joke and I will not stand by and watch
[2:44:42.420 --> 2:44:46.700]  humanity turned over to these people and I beg God for the strength and the will
[2:44:46.700 --> 2:44:51.500]  to have the discernment to help be part of their defeat and I've been saying that
[2:44:51.500 --> 2:44:56.060]  prayer for 20 plus years and God is delivering because God is great thank
[2:44:56.060 --> 2:45:02.940]  God for his son Jesus Christ and now let's move forward against the NW
[2:45:04.700 --> 2:45:10.700]  my phone has been ringing off the hook constitutional lawyers national talk
[2:45:10.700 --> 2:45:14.300]  show host prominent guest I've had on over the years and they're all saying
[2:45:14.300 --> 2:45:18.420]  Alex it's incredible you've been obsessing on China since you got on air
[2:45:18.420 --> 2:45:22.260]  20 something years ago and now it's all coming through how does you know it
[2:45:22.260 --> 2:45:26.540]  because the council on farm relations is the shadow government and they admitted
[2:45:26.540 --> 2:45:31.700]  the plan to transfer all power to communist China and almost everyone
[2:45:31.700 --> 2:45:36.220]  calling me says yeah and they banned you because you were saying all that and how
[2:45:36.220 --> 2:45:40.460]  Silicon Valley Google and Apple moved over there and it's incredible and wow
[2:45:40.460 --> 2:45:45.300]  you're vindicated you're gonna get back on the air now aren't you and no if we
[2:45:45.300 --> 2:45:48.660]  don't defeat this takeover you're all gonna be taken off in fact you're all
[2:45:48.660 --> 2:45:51.860]  gonna end up getting put in prison camps they're making their move they're
[2:45:51.860 --> 2:45:55.700]  coming for your guns they're coming for your kids they're coming for your right
[2:45:55.700 --> 2:46:00.380]  to religion they are coming for your soul well you know what they say you
[2:46:00.380 --> 2:46:04.460]  gotta lower your ideals of freedom if you want to suck on the warm teat of
[2:46:04.460 --> 2:46:09.260]  China China was already running the United States you're like well China
[2:46:09.260 --> 2:46:13.380]  could never take it with the U.S. that's right as the Roman historian and
[2:46:13.380 --> 2:46:19.140]  senator Cicero warned a powerful Empire can't fall from without before it first
[2:46:19.140 --> 2:46:25.740]  falls from within so yes they're coming for your guns all of them yes they're
[2:46:25.740 --> 2:46:29.420]  coming for your children they've already taken your speech almost everywhere
[2:46:29.420 --> 2:46:35.220]  except pockets of resistance like info wars.com and ban.video so now you know
[2:46:35.220 --> 2:46:40.500]  why I'm so upset now you know why I'm so angry I saw the producers of South Park
[2:46:40.500 --> 2:46:44.300]  on TV they're totally pissing angry people like why are they angry because
[2:46:44.300 --> 2:46:48.780]  they see all of their freedom their American freedom hard fought taken away
[2:46:48.780 --> 2:46:53.380]  are you gonna get upset well you're a listener you're obviously are upset but
[2:46:53.380 --> 2:46:57.060]  you've got to ring the alarm everywhere until others they've got to get upset and
[2:46:57.060 --> 2:47:00.540]  then take action and let Congress everybody else know that we're not
[2:47:00.540 --> 2:47:08.180]  backing down we're not going to sell America to the chai comes you're
[2:47:08.180 --> 2:47:37.180]  listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:37.180 --> 2:47:48.620]  I won't get what I'm after till the day I die that means you haven't found God in
[2:47:48.620 --> 2:47:57.940]  discernment because it is good versus evil it's that simple and we're on this
[2:47:57.940 --> 2:48:02.180]  planet for a reason and the establishment is angry because their
[2:48:02.180 --> 2:48:07.060]  world government plan is in trouble their whole system their whole mark of the
[2:48:07.060 --> 2:48:13.300]  beast planetary system is in trouble doctor is reporting on the fact that
[2:48:13.300 --> 2:48:17.580]  they have undoubtedly all the secret testing in Latin America the brain
[2:48:17.580 --> 2:48:22.060]  chip testing that's on drugs report it's far worse than that LeBron James
[2:48:22.060 --> 2:48:27.460]  bowing to communist China that control has been there a long time but now
[2:48:27.460 --> 2:48:31.380]  Steve we're just now learning about it because I think God's giving the world
[2:48:31.380 --> 2:48:35.380]  a choice I mean I believe in revelation I believe in all that but I also think
[2:48:35.380 --> 2:48:41.900]  that the severity of it and how it unfolds to an extent depends on how we
[2:48:41.900 --> 2:48:46.260]  respond and what we do it's all predestined but God gave us free will
[2:48:46.260 --> 2:48:54.180]  and the ultimate outcome exactly how it plays out is up to us absolutely you're
[2:48:54.180 --> 2:48:58.860]  so right Alex and the thing is is you know for a Christian to believe that
[2:48:58.860 --> 2:49:02.940]  well it's it's in the Bible and this is all got to happen to see this is a cop
[2:49:02.940 --> 2:49:07.460]  out this is a cop out because it negates my responsibility to act and
[2:49:07.460 --> 2:49:12.620]  respond like you said to do something about it now and the truth of it is is
[2:49:12.620 --> 2:49:16.660]  God has stayed so many different judgments and different things in history
[2:49:16.660 --> 2:49:21.740]  if his people would just humble themselves and I'm talking about real
[2:49:21.740 --> 2:49:25.220]  believers not not churchgoers not you know you know I don't know if you
[2:49:25.220 --> 2:49:31.580]  realize this or not Alex but in many ways you are more of a preacher in a
[2:49:31.580 --> 2:49:35.620]  church pulpit today because you're telling people the truth and you're
[2:49:35.620 --> 2:49:41.260]  telling them what they need to hear and not not the lies not the not the little
[2:49:41.260 --> 2:49:45.060]  fluffy sermenette not the wonder why that's happened because the churches
[2:49:45.060 --> 2:49:49.540]  got rid of their authority they turn themselves over almost all of them to
[2:49:49.540 --> 2:49:53.300]  quote not get regulated by the government well by not getting regulated
[2:49:53.300 --> 2:49:57.740]  they became regulated first amendment said that the Congress could make no law
[2:49:57.740 --> 2:50:01.100]  respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting their free exercise
[2:50:01.100 --> 2:50:06.740]  thereof we have laid down as as a church you know the body of Christ in
[2:50:06.740 --> 2:50:10.180]  America not other parts of the world I mean they know how to live as a
[2:50:10.180 --> 2:50:14.380]  Christian they die you know you see this guy's walking out on the beach by you
[2:50:14.380 --> 2:50:17.180]  know being led out by ISIS and they're beheaded right there on the beach they
[2:50:17.180 --> 2:50:22.380]  know it's serious and they understand that Americans have been so pampered so
[2:50:22.380 --> 2:50:28.180]  complacent so apathetic for so long they're like that chicken that was raised
[2:50:28.180 --> 2:50:33.020]  just for Thanksgiving or that turkey you know we've we've we've puffed it up we
[2:50:33.020 --> 2:50:36.740]  it's all puffed up it can't run anymore but it's sitting there waiting to be
[2:50:36.740 --> 2:50:40.260]  slaughtered and that's what Americans are like right now they're apathetic
[2:50:40.260 --> 2:50:45.700]  they're ignorant they're dumbed down and mainstream media has programmed them and
[2:50:45.700 --> 2:50:49.940]  the globalist making they're making their move right now but that's a
[2:50:49.940 --> 2:50:53.980]  listening an awakening and that's why the fights joined and the way it was
[2:50:53.980 --> 2:50:56.460]  bigger than they thought it would be they didn't be an awakening when they
[2:50:56.460 --> 2:51:01.220]  made their move but now it's spectacular Sandy Jewel and Julie when I take your
[2:51:01.220 --> 2:51:06.180]  calls here before Paul Watson takes over here very very soon let's go ahead and
[2:51:06.180 --> 2:51:11.180]  talk to Sandy Sandy from Pennsylvania thanks for calling hi good afternoon I
[2:51:11.180 --> 2:51:15.340]  spoke to you once before a few months back thanks for calling I remember your
[2:51:15.340 --> 2:51:21.220]  voice yeah you know I don't understand why Donald Trump doesn't make his move
[2:51:21.220 --> 2:51:24.700]  and round these people up that are threatening his life because if you make
[2:51:24.700 --> 2:51:29.100]  a threat to somebody in normal society they're going to report you're going to
[2:51:29.100 --> 2:51:34.420]  go to jail or get locked up and wait for trial ever you know I get angry here and
[2:51:34.420 --> 2:51:40.220]  you know Phil mother whatever his name is talk about killing the president it's
[2:51:40.220 --> 2:51:45.620]  all crazy they need to stop they need to be arrested and put in jail or executed
[2:51:45.620 --> 2:51:51.020]  for the treasonous things that they're doing you know I am a Trump supporter I'm
[2:51:51.020 --> 2:51:56.020]  not afraid of the deep state I'm not afraid of Obama or Hillary or Bill the
[2:51:56.020 --> 2:52:01.820]  pedophile rapist I'm just angry that this is continuing and the people that
[2:52:01.820 --> 2:52:06.220]  are making the threats are not going to win any of this if something happens to
[2:52:06.220 --> 2:52:11.540]  president Trump which it's not going to because God chose him and God has his
[2:52:11.540 --> 2:52:16.380]  hands over him and his family and these people that are making these threats
[2:52:16.380 --> 2:52:21.860]  need to shut up and leave it alone and you know if they want to hurt somebody
[2:52:21.860 --> 2:52:27.460]  let them hurt themselves leave president Trump alone he's a good well they have
[2:52:27.460 --> 2:52:30.980]  hurt themselves and cut themselves off from God but but I see on the board here
[2:52:30.980 --> 2:52:34.020]  you were to say we need to pray and I think we need to not just pray we need
[2:52:34.020 --> 2:52:38.300]  to ask God to come back into the world and and and move against the enemy they
[2:52:38.300 --> 2:52:46.020]  call on their little God and what they fear is us calling on God the devil
[2:52:46.020 --> 2:52:51.380]  never wins God knows the outcome he's the old powerful almighty Lord and yeah
[2:52:51.380 --> 2:52:56.020]  we need to we need to play you need to hold hands and play cuz God enters
[2:52:56.020 --> 2:53:01.740]  prayers for more than two people are playing he hears sure God's gonna do it
[2:53:01.740 --> 2:53:07.700]  but God wants us to call on God because God's about free will isn't a bully that
[2:53:07.700 --> 2:53:11.340]  takes over like Satan thank you so much great point Sandy you want to comment on
[2:53:11.340 --> 2:53:15.740]  that to Steve oh Sandy's right I mean you know and like you said God's not a
[2:53:15.740 --> 2:53:21.900]  bully he's not a bully but he is omnipotent and also Jesus said that all
[2:53:21.900 --> 2:53:28.060]  the gates of hell will not prevail against the kingdom of God so you know
[2:53:28.060 --> 2:53:32.460]  the power is with people the problem with so many believers is they don't
[2:53:32.460 --> 2:53:36.540]  really believe the Lord so they don't really understand the power they have
[2:53:36.540 --> 2:53:39.620]  because it's like a superstition it's more like a superstition because I
[2:53:39.620 --> 2:53:42.540]  thought this is my the new Hillary really well on record ran her early
[2:53:42.540 --> 2:53:46.740]  campaigns with Bill Larry Nichols and others and later it came out in the news
[2:53:46.740 --> 2:53:50.540]  exactly what he said and she said well I I'm a Satanist and her cultist in case
[2:53:50.540 --> 2:53:54.660]  that's God but I'm also going to church I mean you talk about crazy she goes in
[2:53:54.660 --> 2:53:59.820]  case Jesus is it she also prays to Jesus I mean these people are crazy yeah
[2:53:59.820 --> 2:54:03.460]  they're crazy and you know trying to hedge your bets like that that's that's
[2:54:03.460 --> 2:54:07.700]  that's a waste of time and what's the Bible say you were hot or cold I spit
[2:54:07.700 --> 2:54:12.580]  you out of my mouth you're lukewarm that's right lukewarm God hates lukewarm
[2:54:12.580 --> 2:54:16.220]  hates it you're either hot or you're cold and that's what Americans need to be
[2:54:16.220 --> 2:54:21.340]  right now take a side stand up for what's right speak out this political
[2:54:21.340 --> 2:54:25.020]  correctness garbage man this is programmed into us this is not the new
[2:54:25.020 --> 2:54:29.700]  normal that's that term new normal it's like it's like saying diarrhea is a new
[2:54:29.700 --> 2:54:32.500]  normal no it's not that's not the way you're supposed to be you're right you
[2:54:32.500 --> 2:54:36.780]  look at these these letters for slaves Sandy God bless you thank you Julie in
[2:54:36.780 --> 2:54:42.300]  New Jersey Julie you're on the air than jewel go ahead Julie hey Alex hi
[2:54:42.300 --> 2:54:48.100]  welcome hi so great to talk to you I I totally agree I think the Holy Spirit
[2:54:48.100 --> 2:54:54.140]  though is moving and I am literally thinking things and I hear it come right
[2:54:54.140 --> 2:54:59.700]  out of your mouth and I think it's amazing when you said the other day that
[2:54:59.700 --> 2:55:06.580]  we have to surrender to God that is true and I think in the past the book of
[2:55:06.580 --> 2:55:12.060]  Joel where people you know wore sackcloth got on their hands and knees
[2:55:12.060 --> 2:55:19.900]  repented fasted prayed God spared them and I think that's what we have to do
[2:55:19.900 --> 2:55:25.060]  now and even though like at the end of the day we have to go into the street
[2:55:25.060 --> 2:55:32.740]  maybe demonstrate our success in that endeavor is guaranteed by our prayer
[2:55:32.740 --> 2:55:41.060]  because we turn it over to God and I was actually hoping as sort of a de facto
[2:55:41.060 --> 2:55:47.380]  kind of Christian leader that you've become that you could maybe you know
[2:55:47.380 --> 2:55:55.340]  promote a national prayer campaign people just pledge 15 minutes a day get on
[2:55:55.340 --> 2:56:02.380]  your hands and knees skip the meal pray offer sacrifice to our Lord so that we
[2:56:02.380 --> 2:56:08.580]  can you know really succeed have that power and I think your guest is
[2:56:08.580 --> 2:56:16.940]  unbelievable and before I even called I I've been on hold I was writing down two
[2:56:16.940 --> 2:56:23.780]  Thessalonians and then your guest said how he thought that maybe Trump was the
[2:56:23.780 --> 2:56:30.860]  one that Paul was referring to as the person who is restraining the Antichrist
[2:56:30.860 --> 2:56:37.300]  but then will be removed and I had written that down and then the next thing
[2:56:37.300 --> 2:56:41.140]  you know it's out of your guest mouth so well because we're on the same page
[2:56:41.140 --> 2:56:44.300]  where some potica were dialed into the same wavelength and then the enemies
[2:56:44.300 --> 2:56:47.700]  dialed into their wavelength and let's remember this you read the Bible it's
[2:56:47.700 --> 2:56:52.340]  all coming true this the Antichrist wages were on the saints and overcomes them
[2:56:52.340 --> 2:56:57.660]  in round one but only rules for a day that could be a day or a day as is a
[2:56:57.660 --> 2:57:02.380]  year back and forth not very long they build it it's falling apart the day the
[2:57:02.380 --> 2:57:06.000]  new world order opens for business look at how even coming into things there's
[2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:10.340]  birth pains and wars and it's all insane it's it's it's dysfunctional it's
[2:57:10.340 --> 2:57:14.460]  failed it never blast off God bless you I appreciate your call we'll come back and
[2:57:14.460 --> 2:57:17.580]  finish up with jewel and one little more segment that Paul Watson's taking
[2:57:17.580 --> 2:57:21.820]  over but you want to comment on that Steve yeah I do because that that that
[2:57:21.820 --> 2:57:26.100]  whole thing with the saints are overcome let me just tell you that is in the last
[2:57:26.100 --> 2:57:31.060]  that's the last three and a half years and a lot of people call is seven years
[2:57:31.060 --> 2:57:33.660]  a tribulation period I want to straighten that out for a lot of people
[2:57:33.660 --> 2:57:38.100]  who are listening who are believers number one the tribulation period is a
[2:57:38.100 --> 2:57:42.780]  total of seven years but the wrath of God has not poured out until the last three
[2:57:42.780 --> 2:57:47.980]  and a half years so we're not we're what I call the beginning of sorrows what
[2:57:47.980 --> 2:57:57.180]  Jesus called Josh in Washington you're on the year go ahead Alex God bless you
[2:57:57.180 --> 2:58:01.140]  I have an idea for a new info wars t-shirt instead of this is your brain

[2:59:55.660 --> 3:00:09.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show you could accept the fact that the city
[3:00:09.620 --> 3:00:13.780]  is headed for a disaster of biblical proportion what do you mean biblical
[3:00:13.780 --> 3:00:18.020]  what do you mean this old testament yes our mayor real wrath of God type stuff
[3:00:18.020 --> 3:00:22.300]  fire and brimstone coming down from the skies rivers and seas boiling 40 years
[3:00:22.300 --> 3:00:25.980]  of darkness earthquakes volcanoes the dead rising from the grave human
[3:00:25.980 --> 3:00:28.540]  sacrifice dogs and cats living together
[3:00:28.540 --> 3:00:36.580]  mass hysteria I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against
[3:00:36.580 --> 3:00:44.540]  every form of tyranny over the mind of man Thomas Jefferson live from Austin
[3:00:44.540 --> 3:00:54.060]  Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones well there's a lot of news I meant
[3:00:54.060 --> 3:00:58.020]  to get to today Paul Watson's ready to take over and we've got our guests here
[3:00:58.020 --> 3:01:01.900]  we'll take a final call from Jewel in Ohio I appreciate you all holding Jules
[3:01:01.900 --> 3:01:04.700]  you're on the air go ahead
[3:01:06.900 --> 3:01:11.300]  you know everything that all the other callers have said I totally agree with
[3:01:11.300 --> 3:01:15.500]  and the reason I called in is because I myself I've had the same feeling of
[3:01:15.500 --> 3:01:19.140]  dread just doom kind of building up and I even told my husband last week I
[3:01:19.140 --> 3:01:22.740]  haven't felt like this since right before 9-11 happened so I think you know
[3:01:22.740 --> 3:01:26.820]  we're all kind of feeling the same thing and I just think God is putting this
[3:01:26.820 --> 3:01:31.500]  feeling in us so that we can do something about it well that's right and a
[3:01:31.500 --> 3:01:34.580]  lot of us do with Trump pulling out of Syria which everybody wants to head
[3:01:34.580 --> 3:01:38.420]  through bed and go oh we let the Kurds down Obama went and started that war
[3:01:38.420 --> 3:01:41.780]  that has stabilized the whole place millions are flooding into Turkey the
[3:01:41.780 --> 3:01:45.540]  plan is to collapse Turkey into Europe Erdogan's threatening to send them in
[3:01:45.540 --> 3:01:49.340]  to Europe if we don't stop it and so he's pushing them back in there and none
[3:01:49.340 --> 3:01:52.500]  of that's good it's not fun we didn't start it but the fact that for the first
[3:01:52.500 --> 3:01:56.540]  time in you know 50 60 years we're not starting a war we're pulling out of
[3:01:56.540 --> 3:02:00.460]  somewhere it's not cutting and running it's stopping the destruction of this
[3:02:00.460 --> 3:02:05.780]  country let me go to Steven get his take on that I just want to comment on what
[3:02:05.780 --> 3:02:09.100]  she just said about this feeling you know you talked about it when you kicked
[3:02:09.100 --> 3:02:13.260]  off the show this morning Alex and I'll tell you it really you know when you see
[3:02:13.260 --> 3:02:16.820]  all this stuff you know Pelosi wearing a bullet bracelet I mean you know with
[3:02:16.820 --> 3:02:21.420]  orange on it you know and the connection with Donald Trump is orange hair and
[3:02:21.420 --> 3:02:25.160]  all these other things oh they're all into Alasdair Crowley voodoo they're
[3:02:25.160 --> 3:02:29.140]  all into it they're all doing rituals yeah but here's the thing when she said
[3:02:29.140 --> 3:02:31.860]  that this feeling I don't know what it's all for I'm gonna tell you what it's all
[3:02:31.860 --> 3:02:37.740]  for it's very simple God wants us to pray this is why he allows us to feel
[3:02:37.740 --> 3:02:43.740]  this this unexplainable tension or anxiety whatever you want to call it he
[3:02:43.740 --> 3:02:47.460]  wants us to pray it's a signal just like when you wake up in the middle of the
[3:02:47.460 --> 3:02:51.980]  night and somebody you haven't even seen for years comes into your head and you
[3:02:51.980 --> 3:02:55.780]  should start praying for that because in the next day they're dead you found they
[3:02:55.780 --> 3:02:59.180]  died that night could be or they're in prison or they were in a car wreck and
[3:02:59.180 --> 3:03:03.580]  absolutely and and that's what I for weeks I said months I'm angry I'm
[3:03:03.580 --> 3:03:05.940]  frustrated I don't know what it is I'm supposed to do something and it hit me
[3:03:05.940 --> 3:03:11.100]  just the other night is I need to pray and I need because we then funnel God's
[3:03:11.100 --> 3:03:16.700]  spirit into the earth through our free will we have to open that circuit and he
[3:03:16.700 --> 3:03:21.500]  gives us he gives us the power basically to to block out this negativity I mean
[3:03:21.500 --> 3:03:26.140]  if you're watching TV if you watch a mainstream media oh the minute I start
[3:03:26.140 --> 3:03:31.220]  praying the anxiety goes away I want to get back to that jewel red point anything
[3:03:31.220 --> 3:03:35.860]  else I just wanted to give a quick shout out to the products that I use a ton of
[3:03:35.860 --> 3:03:40.780]  your products we love them the x2 is an absolutely life-changing for my oldest
[3:03:40.780 --> 3:03:45.740]  son who has autism it's completely turned his life around and made him be able
[3:03:45.740 --> 3:03:49.020]  to function normally so I just want to thank you for that and I will always
[3:03:49.020 --> 3:03:52.380]  always buy your product ma'am don't think I've got stabbing to do this today
[3:03:52.380 --> 3:03:56.660]  stacks of mainline articles and studies that they had tens of millions of people
[3:03:56.660 --> 3:04:00.220]  that wouldn't talk who were basically autistic they didn't call it that in
[3:04:00.220 --> 3:04:03.340]  China till they put iodine in their water supply and now their IQ keeps
[3:04:03.340 --> 3:04:06.660]  climbing and climbing while ours is dropping the globalists know what
[3:04:06.660 --> 3:04:10.220]  they're doing they didn't put the bad halogen fluoride in to make it even worse
[3:04:10.220 --> 3:04:14.620]  yep it turned his life around he's a you know you wouldn't even know he's
[3:04:14.620 --> 3:04:18.140]  autistic anymore and it was all from a happy vaccine a rogue nurse gave him at
[3:04:18.140 --> 3:04:22.780]  birth and that's what did it and you know x2 took that out of him I know so
[3:04:22.780 --> 3:04:25.460]  many people that have particularly boys don't have strong blood brain barriers
[3:04:25.460 --> 3:04:27.900]  like girls they're 18 months they're talking they're healthy they give them
[3:04:27.900 --> 3:04:32.620]  that shot and they ever talking in God bless you jewel I'm sorry right of time
[3:04:32.620 --> 3:04:39.300]  wow Paul Watson said to take over please pray for Trump in Dallas tonight pray
[3:04:39.300 --> 3:04:41.620]  for everybody pray for him for us pray for our crew that's gonna be up there
[3:04:41.620 --> 3:04:46.220]  tonight and we'll be here covering all this information tonight at band dot
[3:04:46.220 --> 3:04:51.380]  video and at info wars.com for show live coverage on the street of the Trump
[3:04:51.380 --> 3:04:54.380]  rally we're gonna have on the street tonight one way or another we're gonna
[3:04:54.380 --> 3:04:58.020]  have those live feeds here for you want to thank Steve Allen for joining us Steve
[3:04:58.020 --> 3:05:03.020]  Allen thank you so much God bless you all lots of takes over right now I've
[3:05:03.020 --> 3:05:07.780]  got a really handed to the listeners and viewers from info wars your support
[3:05:07.780 --> 3:05:12.980]  and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of
[3:05:12.980 --> 3:05:17.500]  corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the U.S. worldwide and
[3:05:17.500 --> 3:05:22.900]  President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic
[3:05:22.900 --> 3:05:27.500]  liberty is amazing as well he's still lacking on the big tech censorship
[3:05:27.500 --> 3:05:31.340]  taking action against that in some other areas but trying to end the wars
[3:05:31.340 --> 3:05:35.100]  boosting our economy speaking out against communist China Trump's been
[3:05:35.100 --> 3:05:40.380]  doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're
[3:05:40.380 --> 3:05:45.100]  being targeted because we are effective and the globalist are beginning to lose
[3:05:45.100 --> 3:05:49.380]  their war against humanity in a big way and so we're gonna see some major
[3:05:49.380 --> 3:05:54.340]  fireworks out of them but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we
[3:05:54.340 --> 3:05:58.700]  see all the poison they spray at us that's an attempt to demoralize us we've
[3:05:58.700 --> 3:06:27.140]  got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy
[3:06:27.140 --> 3:06:29.860]  um yeah
[3:06:57.860 --> 3:07:02.700]  alive it is a fourth hour of the Alex Jones show we got an absolute ton of
[3:07:02.700 --> 3:07:09.700]  news to cover today focusing on the rebellion against extinction rebellion
[3:07:09.700 --> 3:07:14.660]  it didn't take long did it and now they chose out of all the targets that they
[3:07:14.660 --> 3:07:19.740]  could have picked to protest against climate change they chose an electric
[3:07:19.740 --> 3:07:25.780]  powered train the London underground and the reaction was not too pleasant to
[3:07:25.780 --> 3:07:31.620]  say the least headline upon summit.news also on the drudge report angry
[3:07:31.620 --> 3:07:35.780]  Londoners drag climate change protesters from roof of train middle class
[3:07:35.780 --> 3:07:40.940]  virtue signals met with little enthusiasm from working-class commuters and
[3:07:40.940 --> 3:07:44.180]  this is the point that I've been making over the past two weeks since these
[3:07:44.180 --> 3:07:50.020]  major protests started in major cities around the world this is a middle or
[3:07:50.020 --> 3:07:55.860]  upper middle-class protest literally damaging inconveniencing the lives of
[3:07:55.860 --> 3:08:02.260]  mainly working-class people they see the video from canning town London this
[3:08:02.260 --> 3:08:08.620]  morning not a great location to pick to pull off this stun given that it's in
[3:08:08.620 --> 3:08:13.340]  east London it's very working-class and it's full of people as you see there
[3:08:13.340 --> 3:08:19.060]  probably at 6 7 a.m. in the morning five people deep as is usual for that time
[3:08:19.060 --> 3:08:21.460]  in the morning with the London underground trying to get on the train
[3:08:21.460 --> 3:08:26.580]  trying to go to work in fact there were some people in the crowd yelling out you
[3:08:26.580 --> 3:08:30.660]  know I've got to put food on my table I've got to get to work why on earth did
[3:08:30.660 --> 3:08:36.020]  they choose to protest in one of the poorest areas of London by climbing on
[3:08:36.020 --> 3:08:40.420]  top of an electric train you would think that they would want to encourage
[3:08:40.420 --> 3:08:45.100]  people to use electric powered public transport given that supposedly
[3:08:45.100 --> 3:08:50.580]  protesting against co2 emissions and climate change yet they picked the
[3:08:50.580 --> 3:08:55.220]  worst possible target and you saw what happened there the racist far left
[3:08:55.220 --> 3:09:01.020]  environmentalist extremist kicked a black man in the face that's what their
[3:09:01.020 --> 3:09:05.940]  protest has come to of course all the media headlines after that were about
[3:09:05.940 --> 3:09:10.620]  how he was pummeled by a mob he wasn't pummeled by a mob yeah there were there
[3:09:10.620 --> 3:09:16.100]  a few punches thrown there a few kicks directed at him but neither this guy or
[3:09:16.100 --> 3:09:19.540]  the second individual because there were two people who jumped on top of this
[3:09:19.540 --> 3:09:23.700]  train really came out of it badly injured in fact they were fine I think
[3:09:23.700 --> 3:09:29.660]  they were later arrested by police but again absolutely insane to choose that
[3:09:29.660 --> 3:09:35.180]  location in London and to choose that method of public transport to pull off
[3:09:35.180 --> 3:09:40.380]  that stunt because as I exhaustively documented in the video I put out about
[3:09:40.380 --> 3:09:45.700]  this last week the truth about extinction rebellion last time they were
[3:09:45.700 --> 3:09:51.180]  targeting the meat market again in London in Smithfields the meat market
[3:09:51.180 --> 3:09:56.060]  which is again a working-class area full of people some of them on minimum wage
[3:09:56.060 --> 3:10:00.940]  others earning very little money others trying to support businesses these are
[3:10:00.940 --> 3:10:08.220]  working class lower class best and they picked the beat market where all the
[3:10:08.220 --> 3:10:13.780]  working-class people work and the train in East London the poorest area of East
[3:10:13.780 --> 3:10:20.580]  London and is it any surprise what happened so four of the protesters were
[3:10:20.580 --> 3:10:23.900]  arrested I don't think any of the individuals involved in the frack off
[3:10:23.900 --> 3:10:28.660]  trying to pull them down from the train were arrested and then there's another
[3:10:28.660 --> 3:10:34.740]  clip which I tweeted earlier headline a guido forks commuter calls out
[3:10:34.740 --> 3:10:38.620]  extinction rebellion for electric train protest and it's basically a bunch of
[3:10:38.620 --> 3:10:45.020]  working-class people and let's say to be fair it's a very diverse crowd isn't it
[3:10:45.020 --> 3:10:51.060]  because canning town those areas of East London Stratford places like that are
[3:10:51.060 --> 3:10:56.460]  literally about 50 60% migrants so it's kind of ironic that those very same
[3:10:56.460 --> 3:11:01.180]  people jumping on top of those trains will be very vehemently pro mass
[3:11:01.180 --> 3:11:07.260]  immigration and yet at least half of the people surrounding them and pulling them
[3:11:07.260 --> 3:11:12.580]  down in this instance were probably migrants that came to the country as a
[3:11:12.580 --> 3:11:17.900]  result of mass immigration so they have the based migrants basically pulling
[3:11:17.900 --> 3:11:22.540]  down dragging down the far left upper middle class environmental poshows and
[3:11:22.540 --> 3:11:28.100]  it was very hilarious to say the least basically extinction rebellion has
[3:11:28.100 --> 3:11:32.100]  been cancelled today if you've read the reactions to their own Facebook posts
[3:11:32.100 --> 3:11:37.460]  their own tweets their own tweet threads virtually every single response
[3:11:37.460 --> 3:11:42.340]  even from people who supported them was like that's it I'm done I can't support
[3:11:42.340 --> 3:11:46.740]  this anymore why are you targeting poor people the ones by the way who are at
[3:11:46.740 --> 3:11:51.100]  the forefront of being impacted by these climate regulations by these climate
[3:11:51.100 --> 3:11:56.340]  taxes as we'll see later on in Holland of course the yellow vest protest in
[3:11:56.340 --> 3:12:03.220]  France started off primarily as a protest against fuel tax hikes because of
[3:12:03.220 --> 3:12:06.900]  the restrictions there on the people out in the suburbs out in the countryside
[3:12:06.900 --> 3:12:11.460]  that brought a lot of the yellow vest protesters to Paris so one of their main
[3:12:11.460 --> 3:12:15.900]  gripes one of their main concerns was environmental regulation environmental
[3:12:15.900 --> 3:12:21.580]  taxes which target the poorest in the west and of course target the poorest
[3:12:21.580 --> 3:12:25.900]  in many third world countries because they're not allowed to develop because
[3:12:25.900 --> 3:12:34.060]  of this whole global warming crusade we had another example of this in Canada
[3:12:34.060 --> 3:12:38.620]  headline video I rate man breaks up line of extinction rebellion protesters
[3:12:38.620 --> 3:12:44.620]  trying to block intersection this was in Edmonton Canada and I rate man broke up
[3:12:44.620 --> 3:12:47.380]  a line of extinction rebellion protesters who were trying to block a
[3:12:47.380 --> 3:12:53.620]  busy intersection as onlookers cheered so there were some guys filming it out of
[3:12:53.620 --> 3:12:59.060]  what looked like an office block window just above the incident and footage of
[3:12:59.060 --> 3:13:01.860]  the incident shows climate change activists blocking a road while holding
[3:13:01.860 --> 3:13:06.820]  a banner that says walk don't talk well quite a few of the people in those
[3:13:06.820 --> 3:13:11.980]  vehicles did talk though yelling at them to get out of the way and then one guy
[3:13:11.980 --> 3:13:15.460]  got out of his car or I think he came from behind I'm not sure if he actually
[3:13:15.460 --> 3:13:21.780]  got out of a vehicle or if he was just walking past grabs their banner throws it
[3:13:21.780 --> 3:13:26.100]  over a wall then grabs one of their phones and smashes it on the ground
[3:13:26.100 --> 3:13:31.780]  they all start having hissy fits the line is broken and traffic resumes as
[3:13:31.780 --> 3:13:37.060]  normal and the people commenting on it as they film it from the window quite
[3:13:37.060 --> 3:13:42.500]  funny as well they say that was brilliant that was effing amazing that
[3:13:42.500 --> 3:13:47.780]  guys my hero so again the rebellion against extinction rebellion continues
[3:13:47.780 --> 3:13:53.540]  to expand across the United Kingdom and across Canada because people are sick
[3:13:53.540 --> 3:13:58.300]  and tired of being told how to live their lives by these privileged upper
[3:13:58.300 --> 3:14:03.540]  middle-class snobs who fly to daddy ski lodge in Stardes Switzerland you know
[3:14:03.540 --> 3:14:08.140]  three times a year somebody pointed that out on a tweet thread a few weeks ago
[3:14:08.140 --> 3:14:14.100]  they collated all the examples of climate change activists taking
[3:14:14.100 --> 3:14:19.380]  photographs from within airplanes out the window and of course then he had
[3:14:19.380 --> 3:14:24.020]  Greta Thunberg who literally pals around with Arnold Schwarzenegger a guy who has
[3:14:24.020 --> 3:14:29.660]  a garage full of muscle cars and tanks Leonardo DiCaprio who goes on yacht
[3:14:29.660 --> 3:14:37.020]  cruises on giant 400-foot yachts owned by Middle Eastern oil billionaires then
[3:14:37.020 --> 3:14:42.100]  the next day he went to a climate march protest you have of course a Prince
[3:14:42.100 --> 3:14:47.180]  Harry who went on four private jet trips in the space of just 11 days was he
[3:14:47.180 --> 3:14:51.540]  doing it to save the planet now we was doing it so he could go and party with
[3:14:51.540 --> 3:14:58.380]  Elton John in his mansion in France they see Greta we cannot criticize who is
[3:14:58.380 --> 3:15:02.980]  literally being sainted as the new Jesus the successor to Jesus Christ in
[3:15:02.980 --> 3:15:08.420]  Sweden they had church bells ring out in honor of Greta I put a YouTube video
[3:15:08.420 --> 3:15:13.900]  about Greta as has others and it got deleted a cyber bullying because you
[3:15:13.900 --> 3:15:18.020]  know they can put up a poster child for their agenda all day long it's a good
[3:15:18.020 --> 3:15:21.060]  little trick that isn't it as soon as you say anything against them against
[3:15:21.060 --> 3:15:26.140]  their message then you get silenced after the break we're gonna get into more
[3:15:26.140 --> 3:15:31.300]  of this because Holland again had a massive protest against climate change
[3:15:31.300 --> 3:15:37.020]  restrictions this is working-class farmers blocking highways producing
[3:15:37.020 --> 3:15:41.780]  traffic jams across the entire country of Holland because like the yellow vests
[3:15:41.780 --> 3:15:46.220]  in Paris they're sick of these environmental regulations impacting
[3:15:46.220 --> 3:15:51.740]  their lifestyles and eviscerating whatever disposable income they have left
[3:15:51.740 --> 3:15:57.300]  we're also gonna get into Norwegians told to pee in the shower again to save

[3:20:04.340 --> 3:20:28.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show so we see the rebellion against
[3:20:28.220 --> 3:20:32.580]  the extinction rebellion and these eco maniacs expanding again if you go and
[3:20:32.580 --> 3:20:36.300]  look at the funding of this group they claim that they're transparent with
[3:20:36.300 --> 3:20:40.260]  their funding but then anyone who donates over five thousand pounds to their
[3:20:40.260 --> 3:20:44.940]  group can have their name hidden so all those top elitist donors do not appear
[3:20:44.940 --> 3:20:50.980]  on record working-class people across London across the UK across many of the
[3:20:50.980 --> 3:20:57.300]  countries are revolting against this rebellion so-called then we have this
[3:20:57.300 --> 3:21:02.780]  story as to the true motivations of this group top story up on summit.news
[3:21:02.780 --> 3:21:07.260]  extinction rebellion co-founder says climate protest is about ending idea
[3:21:07.260 --> 3:21:13.380]  heterosexuality is normal yes he actually wrote this bear in mind the actual
[3:21:13.380 --> 3:21:19.100]  founder of this group and this videos featured in my video said that their
[3:21:19.100 --> 3:21:23.620]  goal was to overthrow democracies and if those democracies didn't fall in line
[3:21:23.620 --> 3:21:28.660]  some people may die those are the exact words of the founder of extinction
[3:21:28.660 --> 3:21:33.100]  rebellion and now one of the co-founders in his own length the article which is
[3:21:33.100 --> 3:21:39.300]  posted on medium.com says that this climate change protest has nothing to do
[3:21:39.300 --> 3:21:43.900]  with the climate what's it about well the co-founder of extinction rebellion
[3:21:43.900 --> 3:21:49.060]  writes the climate protest quo isn't about the climate that's his quo isn't
[3:21:49.060 --> 3:21:53.980]  about the climate and he's actually about toppling European civilization and
[3:21:53.980 --> 3:21:59.660]  ending the idea that heterosexuality is normal what on earth does that have to
[3:21:59.660 --> 3:22:03.700]  do with the climate well in a length the article for medium called extinction
[3:22:03.700 --> 3:22:08.500]  rebellion isn't about the climate Stuart Bazdan who again is one of the
[3:22:08.500 --> 3:22:12.700]  co-founders was there right at the start when this group emerged reveals the true
[3:22:12.700 --> 3:22:17.580]  goals of the far left environmentalist action group he asserts at the beginning
[3:22:17.580 --> 3:22:22.660]  of this article that whatever climate problems exist cannot be fixed in his
[3:22:22.660 --> 3:22:27.260]  own words the co-founder of this group says that their entire raise on detra
[3:22:27.260 --> 3:22:31.900]  is completely meaningless and that the movement should instead be focused on
[3:22:31.900 --> 3:22:37.500]  tearing down the entire capital capitalist system by the way China the
[3:22:37.500 --> 3:22:43.220]  world's biggest polluter isn't mentioned once in this entire article neither is
[3:22:43.220 --> 3:22:47.180]  India neither are any of the biggest polluting countries aside of course from
[3:22:47.180 --> 3:22:53.100]  the UK and the USA Greta Thunberg in her complaint to the UN of course did not
[3:22:53.100 --> 3:22:57.340]  include China on that list of countries she was complaining about just no plans
[3:22:57.340 --> 3:23:02.300]  to go to China and preach the gospel there well now the co-founder claims
[3:23:02.300 --> 3:23:06.500]  that European civilization is to blame for spreading quote cruelty and violence
[3:23:06.500 --> 3:23:11.020]  throughout the globe the last 600 years and bringing torture genocide
[3:23:11.020 --> 3:23:16.620]  carnage and suffering to the ends of the earth what does that have to do with
[3:23:16.620 --> 3:23:21.700]  modern-day co2 emissions owned by the way basically every group on the planet
[3:23:21.700 --> 3:23:28.340]  600 years ago was doing exactly the same he then cites numerous quote delusions
[3:23:28.340 --> 3:23:34.100]  which are to blame for this situation including white supremacy which is odd
[3:23:34.100 --> 3:23:40.300]  given that 99% of these protesters are white patriarchy and class hierarchy
[3:23:40.300 --> 3:23:43.900]  which is also a strange one given that most extinction rebellion protesters
[3:23:43.900 --> 3:23:48.100]  are upper middle-class snobs who do little but inconvenience and harm the
[3:23:48.100 --> 3:23:53.820]  working class as we saw today during the incident in canning town where they
[3:23:53.820 --> 3:23:58.100]  were literally dragged from the train by a bunch of working-class people who
[3:23:58.100 --> 3:24:03.900]  weren't too happy with them he writes quote again this is the co-founder of
[3:24:03.900 --> 3:24:08.860]  extinction rebellion stewart-basden quote the delusions of hetero sexism
[3:24:08.860 --> 3:24:14.660]  heteronormativity this is straight out of gender studies 101 by the way propagate
[3:24:14.660 --> 3:24:18.740]  the idea that heterosexuality is normal and the other expressions of
[3:24:18.740 --> 3:24:24.020]  sexuality are deviant so it's not about the climate it's not about co2
[3:24:24.020 --> 3:24:29.780]  emissions it's about changing the very notion that heterosexuality is the
[3:24:29.780 --> 3:24:35.420]  default biological breeding setting for humankind this is what these people want
[3:24:35.420 --> 3:24:40.820]  the overthrow of absolutely everything so they can remould it in their own image
[3:24:40.820 --> 3:24:46.340]  given what's happening across London across many other countries that is not
[3:24:46.340 --> 3:24:52.620]  a goal shared by many other people and then at the end of the article just to
[3:24:52.620 --> 3:24:58.100]  exemplify his deep-seated white gill he actually admits that he's been harassing
[3:24:58.100 --> 3:25:02.980]  his own family to send reparations to black families in America who share the
[3:25:02.980 --> 3:25:10.060]  same name to compensate again his white gill over slavery so literally the
[3:25:10.060 --> 3:25:14.260]  co-founder of this group is writing that it's not about the climate it's about
[3:25:14.260 --> 3:25:18.460]  overthrowing Western civilization overthrowing the entire capitalist system
[3:25:18.460 --> 3:25:25.620]  and overthrowing the very notion that heterosexuality is normal in his own
[3:25:25.620 --> 3:25:31.540]  words those are the true goals and what do we see going on in Norway right now in
[3:25:31.540 --> 3:25:38.500]  a similar context norwegians told to pee in the shower to save water this was
[3:25:38.500 --> 3:25:44.020]  Friday halted the water and sewer agency in Oslo who appeared on Norwegian
[3:25:44.020 --> 3:25:48.060]  state television to raise awareness about the fact that Norway uses almost
[3:25:48.060 --> 3:25:52.660]  double the amount of water used in Denmark he said quote do not run the
[3:25:52.660 --> 3:25:57.220]  water when you brush your teeth only wash with filled washing machines only by
[3:25:57.220 --> 3:26:01.100]  washing machines that don't use so much water use a pot when you're watering
[3:26:01.100 --> 3:26:06.340]  plants in your garden and pee in the shower in the morning remember these
[3:26:06.340 --> 3:26:11.340]  are the same people who align themselves with muscle car Arnold Schwarzenegger
[3:26:11.340 --> 3:26:17.980]  400 foot luxury yachts owned by a Saudi oil billionaire Leonardo DiCaprio and
[3:26:17.980 --> 3:26:25.340]  four private jet trips in 11 days Prince Harry but you can't use water when
[3:26:25.340 --> 3:26:27.940]  you brush in your teeth you can't leave the tap running and you have to pee in
[3:26:27.940 --> 3:26:33.620]  the shower he'll pleb the host of the show challenged this statement remarking
[3:26:33.620 --> 3:26:36.860]  pee in the shower you do not you do know that many people would choke when you
[3:26:36.860 --> 3:26:41.700]  hear when they hear you say that he said yes but it's a great idea you can
[3:26:41.700 --> 3:26:47.020]  also brush our teeth in the shower it's very good for the environment viewers of
[3:26:47.020 --> 3:26:51.260]  the show similar to those people in that train station that this morning did not
[3:26:51.260 --> 3:26:57.940]  react warmly to the proposal with one asking why not also poop in the shower
[3:26:57.940 --> 3:27:02.380]  meanwhile in the Netherlands Dutch farmers stage new revolt against climate
[3:27:02.380 --> 3:27:07.820]  change restrictions as I said before the break similar situation to what you had
[3:27:07.820 --> 3:27:13.020]  with the yellow vests in Paris a gas tax hike was what brought them out on the
[3:27:13.020 --> 3:27:17.740]  streets against Macron initially that's partially what he had to back down on to
[3:27:17.740 --> 3:27:22.460]  try and assuage those protesters didn't really work they're still out on the
[3:27:22.460 --> 3:27:27.060]  streets it just doesn't get as much media attention well now farmers in the
[3:27:27.060 --> 3:27:29.820]  Netherlands are staging a new revolt against restrictions on livestock
[3:27:29.820 --> 3:27:34.340]  related to climate change with one telling the state broadcast to how he is
[3:27:34.340 --> 3:27:39.340]  sick of being lectured about nature by middle-class city dwellers who have two
[3:27:39.340 --> 3:27:44.460]  plants on their balcony demonstrations began earlier this month of course we
[3:27:44.460 --> 3:27:48.700]  covered it back on October 1st when they started why are the Dutch farmers
[3:27:48.700 --> 3:27:52.060]  protesting because the government came out and announced that they would have
[3:27:52.060 --> 3:27:58.540]  to slash their livestock production by up to 50% to meet commitments on
[3:27:58.540 --> 3:28:03.260]  reducing nitrogen emissions and by the way those same restrictions will not be
[3:28:03.260 --> 3:28:09.300]  levied against the aviation industry only against working-class and lower
[3:28:09.300 --> 3:28:13.980]  middle-class farmers is it any wonder why why they're absolutely furious
[3:28:13.980 --> 3:28:18.740]  why they're clogging up major roads and highways and causing traffic jams across
[3:28:18.740 --> 3:28:22.820]  the country they actually called out the Dutch army to try and deal with this to
[3:28:22.820 --> 3:28:26.460]  try and put roadblocks up to stop them getting to the major cities didn't
[3:28:26.460 --> 3:28:28.780]  really work
[3:28:28.780 --> 3:28:32.780]  Misha Bauer of the Farmers Defense Force told the state broadcast to last year
[3:28:32.780 --> 3:28:37.100]  you didn't hear anything about nitrogen and now it's suddenly a mortal question
[3:28:37.100 --> 3:28:41.060]  farmers also argue that their crucial role in food production is being overlooked
[3:28:41.060 --> 3:28:44.100]  and that they are being blamed for climate change so basically a Dutch
[3:28:44.100 --> 3:28:48.620]  court said the government has to impose these draconian regulations on
[3:28:48.620 --> 3:28:55.140]  nitrogen emissions that would result in 50% livestock production reduction for
[3:28:55.140 --> 3:28:58.660]  the Dutch farmers and they are out there on the streets defending their very

[3:35:41.740 --> 3:35:47.820]  now Mark Zuckerberg got up in front of Georgetown University today and said
[3:35:47.820 --> 3:35:52.460]  how much he really cherishes free speech because it's not like he literally
[3:35:52.460 --> 3:35:56.780]  bans people for having certain opinions and prescribes what opinions you're
[3:35:56.780 --> 3:36:01.740]  allowed to have by making that a warning how dare you even post an image of Alex
[3:36:01.740 --> 3:36:06.820]  Jones for example Big Zuck is watching well now he's cast himself and his
[3:36:06.820 --> 3:36:11.420]  company reports Axios and the headline Mark Zuckerberg doubles down on free
[3:36:11.420 --> 3:36:19.260]  speech as champions of free speech this is truly clown world stuff in a 45
[3:36:19.260 --> 3:36:23.780]  minute talk he said quote I believe we have two responsibilities to remove
[3:36:23.780 --> 3:36:28.020]  content when he could cause real danger as effectively as we can unless it's
[3:36:28.020 --> 3:36:31.740]  literally entire pages devoted to wanting to assassinate Trump then they
[3:36:31.740 --> 3:36:35.300]  stay up for months and months and months and to fight to uphold as wide a
[3:36:35.300 --> 3:36:39.300]  definition of freedom of expression as possible not allowed the definition what
[3:36:39.300 --> 3:36:43.300]  is considered dangerous to expand beyond what is absolutely necessary this is a
[3:36:43.300 --> 3:36:47.860]  company that literally banned me for no reason whatsoever and then when they
[3:36:47.860 --> 3:36:51.980]  finally came out with a reason they said it was because I interviewed Tommy
[3:36:51.980 --> 3:36:57.620]  Robinson three years ago on a completely different platform is that a wider
[3:36:57.620 --> 3:37:03.340]  definition of freedom of expression as possible is shadow banning conservatives
[3:37:03.340 --> 3:37:07.740]  remember back in the day before all this occurred before the social credit
[3:37:07.740 --> 3:37:13.260]  score was brought into fruition they literally had people removing trending
[3:37:13.260 --> 3:37:17.860]  topics from their trending list if they were conservative talking points even
[3:37:17.860 --> 3:37:22.140]  if they were organically trending Zuckerberg said quote I believe people
[3:37:22.140 --> 3:37:26.100]  should decide what is credible not tech companies when it's not absolutely
[3:37:26.100 --> 3:37:30.340]  clear what to do we should err on the side of free expression the tech
[3:37:30.340 --> 3:37:34.140]  companies literally decide that because they prescribe the opinions you're
[3:37:34.140 --> 3:37:39.740]  allowed to have he got up in front of Congress as did Sundar Pichai and said
[3:37:39.740 --> 3:37:44.940]  they don't remove content based on parties and issues that's been disproven
[3:37:44.940 --> 3:37:49.500]  time and time again with my banning with Alex Jones is banning with Laura
[3:37:49.500 --> 3:37:54.820]  Loomer's banning with my Lee nopless is banning again complete and total BS and
[3:37:54.820 --> 3:37:57.620]  by the way they still haven't released the information which they're legally
[3:37:57.620 --> 3:38:02.900]  required to do on why they banned me so that continues to move forward legally
[3:38:02.900 --> 3:38:08.420]  says the big picture Facebook scale and impact has become a flash point for
[3:38:08.420 --> 3:38:12.580]  political criticism in the US around the world of course they will have a big
[3:38:12.580 --> 3:38:18.140]  moral panic about Russians buying $3,000 worth of ads on Facebook but when
[3:38:18.140 --> 3:38:23.340]  you've got a company that has 2.2 billion users literally prescribing the
[3:38:23.340 --> 3:38:27.820]  opinions those users are allowed to have that's not election meddling at all is
[3:38:27.820 --> 3:38:34.060]  it absolute relentless BS meanwhile in France also on the issue of free speech
[3:38:34.060 --> 3:38:38.180]  headline deputy editor of LaFigaro condemned for saying everyone has the
[3:38:38.180 --> 3:38:44.140]  right to hate religion this was a guy called Yves Therade who was condemned
[3:38:44.140 --> 3:38:47.700]  by other journalists after arguing during a television appearance that
[3:38:47.700 --> 3:38:51.620]  Islamophobia doesn't exist because everyone has the right to hate religion
[3:38:51.620 --> 3:38:56.620]  bearing in mind this was a country that suffered two massive jihadist terror
[3:38:56.620 --> 3:39:00.700]  attacks the first one the attack on Charlie Hebdo was because the cartoonist
[3:39:00.700 --> 3:39:06.940]  had expressed that very same opinion that the right to hate a set of beliefs
[3:39:06.940 --> 3:39:11.140]  shouldn't be banned shouldn't be made illegal shouldn't be met with violent
[3:39:11.140 --> 3:39:16.380]  slaughter now journalists talking heads in France are siding with the free
[3:39:16.380 --> 3:39:21.860]  speech advocates no literally with the same sentiment that those ISIS jihadists
[3:39:21.860 --> 3:39:27.060]  took with them as they brutally gunned down cartoonists in Paris France in
[3:39:27.060 --> 3:39:32.380]  January 2015 that's the side they've chosen so he basically said these
[3:39:32.380 --> 3:39:36.940]  comments in the context of a discussion surrounding the banning of the Islamic
[3:39:36.940 --> 3:39:41.900]  veil in public which is supposed to be the law in France is never enforced as
[3:39:41.900 --> 3:39:45.140]  well as the recent murder of four people at police station in Paris by a man who
[3:39:45.140 --> 3:39:51.780]  had converted to Islam so a member of France's national rally party asked the
[3:39:51.780 --> 3:39:55.740]  president of the regional council in France to tell a veiled Muslim woman
[3:39:55.740 --> 3:40:01.140]  accompanying her son to remove her hijab this woman refused to do so and then
[3:40:01.140 --> 3:40:05.860]  she accused the party itself which was merely calling for the law to be enforced
[3:40:05.860 --> 3:40:11.820]  of whipping up a surge of hatred and there are the deputy editor of La Figuero
[3:40:11.820 --> 3:40:16.980]  which is a big newspaper in France responded by saying he had once left a
[3:40:16.980 --> 3:40:20.020]  bus because he saw a woman wearing the full veil and that Islamophobia does
[3:40:20.020 --> 3:40:25.340]  not exist because everyone has the right to hate religion apparently not now we
[3:40:25.340 --> 3:40:29.540]  only have the right to side with literal jihadist terrorists who hate free
[3:40:29.540 --> 3:40:34.860]  speech so he was absolutely slaughtered for simply saying that you should have
[3:40:34.860 --> 3:40:40.860]  the right to hate a set of beliefs if they are barbaric arcane and backwards
[3:40:40.860 --> 3:40:47.140]  meanwhile in Denmark headline nearly half of immigrant descendants in Denmark
[3:40:47.140 --> 3:40:50.700]  say criticizing religion should be illegal these are the people we're
[3:40:50.700 --> 3:40:54.900]  bringing in and this is what they believe what could possibly go wrong nearly
[3:40:54.900 --> 3:40:57.980]  fifty percent of descendants of non-western immigrants in Denmark think
[3:40:57.980 --> 3:41:01.420]  it should be illegal to criticize religion a sharp contrast with the
[3:41:01.420 --> 3:41:07.300]  numbers of ethnic Danes 48 percent of descendants said criticizing religion
[3:41:07.300 --> 3:41:10.340]  should be illegal only 42 percent of first-generation immigrants who have
[3:41:10.340 --> 3:41:14.140]  been in Denmark for three years or more said the same so the more recent
[3:41:14.140 --> 3:41:19.860]  arrivals are actually more anti-free speech than the older immigrants for
[3:41:19.860 --> 3:41:23.220]  ethnic Danes the number who want to get rid of the freedom to criticize
[3:41:23.220 --> 3:41:28.140]  religion was dramatically lower at only 20 percent but when those ethnic Danes
[3:41:28.140 --> 3:41:33.780]  are being replaced at a rapid pace what do you think is going to happen to
[3:41:33.780 --> 3:41:38.580]  freedom of speech across Europe meanwhile in Sweden the progressive
[3:41:38.580 --> 3:41:43.300]  utopia potential bombing after powerful explosion at Swedish police station
[3:41:43.300 --> 3:41:47.580]  I do not even write articles about this anymore used to make videos about
[3:41:47.580 --> 3:41:51.660]  Sweden probably two or three times a year don't even bother anymore because
[3:41:51.660 --> 3:41:55.500]  this is just like every night every night you read the headlines oh there
[3:41:55.500 --> 3:41:59.780]  was an explosion here there was gunfire here there was a stabbing here now a
[3:41:59.780 --> 3:42:03.380]  police station in the Swedish city of Strafenstorp was targeted by an
[3:42:03.380 --> 3:42:07.460]  explosive device with witnesses describing the blast as loud and powerful
[3:42:07.460 --> 3:42:11.740]  the explosion occurred in the early hours of Monday morning and caused damage
[3:42:11.740 --> 3:42:16.260]  to the main door of the building literally every night I go into Swedish
[3:42:16.260 --> 3:42:20.500]  media and it's explosion here explosion here explosion here they don't even
[3:42:20.500 --> 3:42:25.260]  deliver the mail to some of these migrant heavy areas in Stockholm in Malmo
[3:42:25.260 --> 3:42:29.580]  and these are the places because it's too dangerous to do so and Swedes have
[3:42:29.580 --> 3:42:33.660]  just accepted this this is their cultural enrichment this is their
[3:42:33.660 --> 3:42:38.260]  progressive utopia in a related story nearly one-fifth of Sweden's population
[3:42:38.260 --> 3:42:42.020]  is now foreign born nearly one in five people living in Sweden was born in a
[3:42:42.020 --> 3:42:45.220]  foreign country newly released statistics have revealed
[3:42:45.220 --> 3:42:51.340]  according to statistics Sweden 19.1% of Sweden's population nearly two million
[3:42:51.340 --> 3:42:56.700]  people were born outside the country they forecast that in 2040 the majority of
[3:42:56.700 --> 3:43:01.220]  people in Sweden will not be ethnically Swedish good luck with that
[3:43:01.220 --> 3:43:06.220]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from FORCE your
[3:43:06.220 --> 3:43:11.180]  support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist
[3:43:11.180 --> 3:43:15.500]  system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the US
[3:43:15.500 --> 3:43:19.980]  worldwide and President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting
[3:43:19.980 --> 3:43:25.420]  Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well he's still lacking on the big tech
[3:43:25.420 --> 3:43:30.060]  censorship taking action against that in some other areas but try to end the
[3:43:30.060 --> 3:43:34.100]  wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist China Trump's been
[3:43:34.100 --> 3:43:39.420]  doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're
[3:43:39.420 --> 3:43:44.100]  being targeted because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose
[3:43:44.100 --> 3:43:48.420]  their war against humanity in a big way and so we're gonna see some major
[3:43:48.420 --> 3:43:53.340]  fireworks out of them but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we
[3:43:53.340 --> 3:43:57.700]  see all the poison they spray at us that's an attempt to demoralize us we've
[3:43:57.700 --> 3:44:01.380]  got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy
[3:44:01.380 --> 3:44:06.540]  Silicon Valley thinks you're a dumb jellyfish they think the West is dead
[3:44:06.540 --> 3:44:09.540]  they think of a censored nationalist and patriots off internet you'll just
[3:44:09.540 --> 3:44:13.020]  forget about us and then they'll be the only information out there well so far
[3:44:13.020 --> 3:44:16.180]  that's not been working too well for them thanks to you spreading the word

[3:48:55.460 --> 3:49:00.940]  19% over the course of the last year we've got eco mentalists blocking major
[3:49:00.940 --> 3:49:04.780]  bridges blocking major highways the police just stand by and do absolutely
[3:49:04.780 --> 3:49:10.900]  nothing as they're ordered to do but don't worry because they are policing
[3:49:10.900 --> 3:49:15.700]  pronouns headline British chief of police warns misgendering people is a
[3:49:15.700 --> 3:49:21.180]  form of abuse the chief of police in Britain chose to recognize international
[3:49:21.180 --> 3:49:26.100]  pronouns day and now they've got some other stupid one on Twitter spirit day
[3:49:26.100 --> 3:49:31.820]  or some absolute BS literally every day they're having our entire LGBT month
[3:49:31.820 --> 3:49:38.100]  they also have to have every single day a trending hashtag on their pronouns well
[3:49:38.100 --> 3:49:41.460]  now a chief of police in Britain says that misgendering transgender people is
[3:49:41.460 --> 3:49:46.100]  a form of abuse and this is no idle threat by the way as I point out in
[3:49:46.100 --> 3:49:51.140]  this article just about six months ago a 38 year old woman was arrested in
[3:49:51.140 --> 3:49:56.460]  her own kitchen in front of her children locked up for seven hours because of the
[3:49:56.460 --> 3:50:01.460]  crime of referring to a transgender woman as a man on the internet people
[3:50:01.460 --> 3:50:05.580]  being stabbed like literally 10 minutes away but you called a man a man on the
[3:50:05.580 --> 3:50:10.260]  internet get in jail a man was also interrogate for 30 minutes by police for
[3:50:10.260 --> 3:50:17.020]  liking the limerick on Twitter that's right he didn't even write the tweet it
[3:50:17.020 --> 3:50:21.380]  was a tweet was a limerick that made fun of transgender people he liked it they
[3:50:21.380 --> 3:50:25.060]  literally called up his workplace the police found out who he was and
[3:50:25.060 --> 3:50:29.280]  interrogated him for half an hour he was probably lucky to not be thrown in a
[3:50:29.280 --> 3:50:34.980]  jail cell for seven hours and a Christian doctor in the UK was also fired from his
[3:50:34.980 --> 3:50:38.340]  government job earlier this summer after he refused to refer to a six foot
[3:50:38.340 --> 3:50:43.620]  bearded man as madam that's the situation in the UK where we have
[3:50:43.620 --> 3:50:48.220]  again 19% increase in violent crime in the last year but don't worry because
[3:50:48.220 --> 3:50:53.060]  pronouns are being policed today's International Pronouns Day said
[3:50:53.060 --> 3:50:57.620]  Detective Chief Constable Julie Cook in a video posted to Twitter which is
[3:50:57.620 --> 3:51:00.540]  particularly important to people who identify as transgender or gender
[3:51:00.540 --> 3:51:06.220]  non-conforming or any of the other infinite genders that now exist she said
[3:51:06.220 --> 3:51:08.940]  being misgendered can have a huge impact on somebody and their personal
[3:51:08.940 --> 3:51:12.780]  well-being it can also be used as a form of abuse so basically it's an open
[3:51:12.780 --> 3:51:17.220]  threat that they're on the lookout for this that you may be the next victim of
[3:51:17.220 --> 3:51:22.740]  the politically correct thought police last time I this has literally vid this
[3:51:22.740 --> 3:51:28.180]  video of this police chief talking absolute nonsense she really looks like
[3:51:28.180 --> 3:51:33.260]  she believes it as well as a million views I haven't seen the responses but
[3:51:33.260 --> 3:51:39.060]  it's fair to say that that tweet was ratioed so people on buying this clown
[3:51:39.060 --> 3:51:45.660]  world order which is the good news meanwhile project Veritas continues to
[3:51:45.660 --> 3:51:49.980]  hit bombshell after bombshell out of the park CNN supervisor wishes for Trump's
[3:51:49.980 --> 3:51:54.300]  death hopefully soon there was a tweet that went viral earlier from somebody
[3:51:54.300 --> 3:51:58.780]  saying look at all these deplorable Trump supporters celebrating Elijah
[3:51:58.780 --> 3:52:03.100]  Cummings death I didn't see any obviously there was probably a few they do it on a
[3:52:03.100 --> 3:52:08.180]  routine basis that's fine now CNN supervisor was caught on tape wishing
[3:52:08.180 --> 3:52:12.700]  for president Donald Trump's death commenting that it will happen hopefully
[3:52:12.700 --> 3:52:18.660]  soon this is CNN Field production supervisor Gerald Cisnet who was
[3:52:18.660 --> 3:52:21.420]  discussing CNN's obsession with covering Trump all the time before
[3:52:21.420 --> 3:52:24.780]  remarking this is a story that's not gonna go away the only way this will go
[3:52:24.780 --> 3:52:29.660]  away is when he dies hopefully soon and then if you look at the other revelations
[3:52:29.660 --> 3:52:35.660]  the other leaks from James O'Keeffe and project Veritas today it's basically and
[3:52:35.660 --> 3:52:40.900]  this is what I've been told from within many news organizations everybody hates
[3:52:40.900 --> 3:52:44.540]  their jobs everybody's really demoralized that they're no longer doing
[3:52:44.540 --> 3:52:49.540]  actual journalism they're no longer actual news outlets and they have a few
[3:52:49.540 --> 3:52:54.580]  quotes here in this zero hedge article it's all just a bunch of BS CNN manager
[3:52:54.580 --> 3:52:59.060]  laments networks decay on hidden camera there are other quotes as well which
[3:52:59.060 --> 3:53:04.180]  speak to this like Scott Garber senior field engineer at CNN who said quote we
[3:53:04.180 --> 3:53:08.740]  used to cover news we used to go out and do stories but Trump is more important
[3:53:08.740 --> 3:53:13.780]  Adia Jacobs CNN technical operation supervisor said when Zucker took over it
[3:53:13.780 --> 3:53:18.220]  wasn't until Trump that we ended up being all Trump all the time another
[3:53:18.220 --> 3:53:23.340]  person said he Zucker basically said F all the other stories they are so
[3:53:23.340 --> 3:53:26.900]  demoralized they hate their job so much because they know that their
[3:53:26.900 --> 3:53:32.100]  prostitutes that they no longer do real journalism that's why the morale in
[3:53:32.100 --> 3:53:38.700]  newsrooms is historically low just by coincidence news outlets their trust in
[3:53:38.700 --> 3:53:44.540]  news outlets across the general public is also historically low meanwhile
[3:53:44.540 --> 3:53:48.820]  creator of men in black told having an opinion on his own film was old white
[3:53:48.820 --> 3:53:53.460]  mansplaining this was Ed Solomon who was having a conversation with a group of
[3:53:53.460 --> 3:53:59.340]  friendly social justice warriors at a cafe he said where I'm writing the
[3:53:59.340 --> 3:54:02.460]  people next to me were disagreeing about the origins of men in black and I
[3:54:02.460 --> 3:54:06.100]  said if you'd like I could clear that up for you this is the guy who created it
[3:54:06.100 --> 3:54:11.140]  and one of them responded I'm sorry we do not need an old white man's mans
[3:54:11.140 --> 3:54:17.060] planation so I apologize than that was that yes that's the most tragic aspect
[3:54:17.060 --> 3:54:22.060]  of this story that Solomon himself apologized for having an opinion on his
[3:54:22.060 --> 3:54:27.580]  own movie because he's just an old white man and in this new era of racial
[3:54:27.580 --> 3:54:32.340]  tolerance your opinion is automatically rejected because of your skin color
[3:54:32.340 --> 3:54:38.340]  because apparently that's anti-racism now meanwhile South Park is back with a
[3:54:38.340 --> 3:54:43.540]  new episode daily caller reports South Park mocks LeBron James comments on
[3:54:43.540 --> 3:54:48.580]  free speech a new episode let them eat goo South Park to came at LeBron James
[3:54:48.580 --> 3:54:51.540]  of this Wednesday night episode let them eat goo of course last week their
[3:54:51.540 --> 3:54:56.700]  episode banned in China was banned in China because it mocked China the NBA
[3:54:56.700 --> 3:55:02.580]  one of the most woke pro-social justice networks sporting agencies in the entire
[3:55:02.580 --> 3:55:07.740]  country immediately caved and fell into line and supported communist China one
[3:55:07.740 --> 3:55:11.340]  of the biggest human rights abuses against minorities on the entire planet
[3:55:11.340 --> 3:55:16.060]  now according to the Hollywood reporter the episode South Park episode mocked the
[3:55:16.060 --> 3:55:20.340]  NBA stars comments on free speech James foolishly said we have a right to free
[3:55:20.340 --> 3:55:26.300]  speech but there apparently can be grave consequences in the episode they
[3:55:26.300 --> 3:55:30.260]  satirized this by having Cartman say quote yes we do have freedom of speech
[3:55:30.260 --> 3:55:34.100]  but at times there are ramifications the negative that can happen when you're
[3:55:34.100 --> 3:55:38.540]  not thinking about others and only thinking about yourself again this is a
[3:55:38.540 --> 3:55:44.180]  guy LeBron James who repeatedly tweeted about people like MLK fighting
[3:55:44.180 --> 3:55:49.620]  injustice in fact I've got the tweet here LeBron James said quote injustice
[3:55:49.620 --> 3:55:54.380]  anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere apart from apparently when
[3:55:54.380 --> 3:55:59.460]  that injustice is being doled out by communist China and because they're his
[3:55:59.460 --> 3:56:05.980]  paymasters it's just fine and T for radical threatened to bring out the
[3:56:05.980 --> 3:56:09.660]  guillotine if church shows Jordan Peterson documentary remember these are
[3:56:09.660 --> 3:56:13.820]  the anti-fascists and T for leftists are threatening to bring out the guillotine
[3:56:13.820 --> 3:56:18.140]  if a church shows documentary about best-selling author Jordan Peterson so
[3:56:18.140 --> 3:56:21.860]  basically there's a documentary about Jordan Peterson it's already being
[3:56:21.860 --> 3:56:26.740]  cancelled in a bunch of theaters across America and Canada including in
[3:56:26.740 --> 3:56:30.940]  Brooklyn and Toronto because the people screening it said there were fearful of
[3:56:30.940 --> 3:56:35.980]  quote getting in trouble all the precise the precise nature of that trouble was
[3:56:35.980 --> 3:56:40.220]  revealed when the film's co-creator maziore Ganderi received a text from a
[3:56:40.220 --> 3:56:44.100]  pastor who'd received threats after agreeing to screen the film in his
[3:56:44.100 --> 3:56:49.100]  church one of the threats included a promise to bring out the guillotine to
[3:56:49.100 --> 3:56:56.620]  fix society so much for the tolerant left suicides and homicides on the rise in
[3:56:56.620 --> 3:57:02.100]  young people this is a CDC report is the report our NBC news suicides and
[3:57:02.100 --> 3:57:05.180]  homicides are on the rise among children teens and young adults in America
[3:57:05.180 --> 3:57:08.820]  according to a new report the highlights why experts say is a disturbing trend
[3:57:08.820 --> 3:57:16.060]  among the young from 2007 to 2017 the rate rate of Americans ages 10 to 24 who
[3:57:16.060 --> 3:57:22.700]  died by suicide rose by 58 percent and people have done the comparisons with
[3:57:22.700 --> 3:57:28.420]  that noting that the decline in faith belief religion has also declined by
[3:57:28.420 --> 3:57:33.100]  almost the same bigger over the course of the last 10 years amongst young people
[3:57:33.100 --> 3:57:38.180]  in that age bracket what a coincidence it also has ties of course to the
[3:57:38.180 --> 3:57:43.100]  detrimental horrific effects that social media has on the mental well-being of
[3:57:43.100 --> 3:57:47.300]  young people which has not been studied nearly enough that's gonna wrap it up
