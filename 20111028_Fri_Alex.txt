[00:44.100 --> 00:47.520]  in the past have prepared a lot of special programming as well I think it's
[00:47.520 --> 00:51.180]  very interesting it is a fundraising event that's because we don't have
[00:51.180 --> 00:56.540]  corporate sponsors and we depend on you buying the books DVDs buying from our
[00:56.540 --> 01:01.140]  sponsors and contributing us to us directly in order to move to the next
[01:01.140 --> 01:05.020]  level now you've seen this program right here the Info Wars Nightly News in
[01:05.020 --> 01:09.860]  its inaugural year only a few months out since the September 1 official launch
[01:09.860 --> 01:15.220]  it's taken several years to physically build the studio from the ground up we
[01:15.220 --> 01:19.020]  have video we're going to show you here at a moment of Alex's call for the money
[01:19.020 --> 01:23.060]  bomb and I'm not sure if it's in this video or the videos that are coming out

[08:00.980 --> 08:06.780]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[08:06.780 --> 08:18.420]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network it is Friday the 28th
[08:18.420 --> 08:29.820]  day of October 2011 and since all Hallows Eve is coming up in a few days I
[08:29.820 --> 08:34.620]  thought I'd show you some real hard today for those of you out there that
[08:34.620 --> 08:42.340]  think it's cute those of you out there that think it's funny and of course if
[08:42.340 --> 08:48.980]  you're a new radio listener you're saying you're going to show us yes we
[08:48.980 --> 08:54.460]  also simulcast this entire three-hour radio transmission in the multicast five
[08:54.460 --> 09:01.420]  camera shoot in here and we premiere videos that of course also have audio
[09:01.420 --> 09:08.140]  suitable for radio here then I do a nightly news show at 7 o'clock central
[09:08.140 --> 09:15.620]  eight o'clock eastern at info wars news.com I'm gonna be honest with you
[09:15.620 --> 09:32.740]  here right now I am in a controlled rage I am in a controlled rage and I do not
[09:32.740 --> 09:40.220]  feel like right now I can do justice to the information that has me in the
[09:40.220 --> 09:48.860]  controlled rage. From time to time I get here on air and I tell you coming up
[09:48.860 --> 09:57.940]  in an hour I'm going to present this big breaking news and I do that on
[09:57.940 --> 10:04.860]  purpose to to point out that this is a big deal and that we need to really pay
[10:04.860 --> 10:10.020]  attention to this particular piece of information mixed in with all this other
[10:10.020 --> 10:16.500]  incredibly important information. From my historical perspective I believe certain
[10:16.500 --> 10:21.580]  issues we cover are obviously more important than others you can analyze it
[10:21.580 --> 10:24.660]  yourself and decide if you agree with me or if you want to add something to it
[10:24.660 --> 10:33.980]  or if you disagree but I saw something last night yesterday and then again last
[10:33.980 --> 10:46.380]  night that particularly touched my soul and they say that the attempt to avoid
[10:46.380 --> 10:53.220]  conflict the attempt to avoid hard decisions is really at the heart of
[10:53.220 --> 10:59.860]  civilizations collapsing I forget who was it said that insanity the definition
[10:59.860 --> 11:03.780]  of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again thinking you're gonna
[11:03.780 --> 11:09.180]  go different result but humans have a limited lifespan and so that's why we
[11:09.180 --> 11:13.780]  have this processes that's why we do it over and over again if we're not
[11:13.780 --> 11:18.860]  studying history and learning from others mistakes and learning about how
[11:18.860 --> 11:24.260]  humans operate the global controllers they do study how humans operate every
[11:24.260 --> 11:32.500]  facet of it chemically biologically spiritually intellectually financially
[11:32.500 --> 11:37.540]  they study that and don't try to then teach that the general public they try
[11:37.540 --> 11:45.460]  to say any analysis is a conspiracy theory when that's all they do and I
[11:45.460 --> 11:51.220]  was thinking last night just about where America stands in history and where
[11:51.220 --> 11:58.780]  America is going if you look at all the different signposts we've passed and the
[11:58.780 --> 12:04.820]  clear quickening that's happening I do not feel like I am a good enough
[12:04.820 --> 12:14.540]  champion for these children that is the main reason I tend to
[12:14.540 --> 12:19.980]  sometimes get on air and say I'm not gonna cover this big news yet sure it
[12:19.980 --> 12:22.900]  has the added effect and I've intellectualized the fact that if I say
[12:22.900 --> 12:27.940]  it's coming up later sure that's classic radio to plant the psychological hook to
[12:27.940 --> 12:32.820]  get you to listen longer and I've had radio execs say oh it's really good how
[12:32.820 --> 12:37.380]  you do that and you know that's 101 but but that's not really why I'm doing it
[12:37.380 --> 12:42.260]  so many days I get up here and don't hit the big top stories for an hour or two
[12:42.260 --> 12:47.700]  because I've analyzed them I've looked at them and there's so many facets to it
[12:47.700 --> 12:54.900]  that I want to properly truly present you with veritas and if I don't summon
[12:54.900 --> 13:00.740]  all of my mental will and discipline because I'm undisciplined I will not
[13:00.740 --> 13:11.620]  even present you 10% of what I should but I am gonna pray to God right now I'm
[13:11.620 --> 13:19.060]  asking God right now in my heart to help me articulate the full magnitude that we
[13:19.060 --> 13:25.900]  face and to be able to articulate it to people in a way that will touch their
[13:25.900 --> 13:31.900]  heart touch their mind and have them stop rationalizing and making excuses and
[13:31.900 --> 13:43.860]  really break out of the trance and see what we are what we've done I've seen a
[13:43.860 --> 13:50.860]  lot of footage of dead and dying children and I'm the type of person that
[13:50.860 --> 13:55.380]  if I close my door on a little one inch gecko and it crushes them I get very
[13:55.380 --> 14:02.300]  sad not because I'm a wimp but because I love life and I love small little
[14:02.300 --> 14:06.540]  delicate things and the globalists would say I'm weak because of that but no
[14:06.540 --> 14:11.260]  it's because I'm strong that I love life
[14:11.260 --> 14:25.500]  and I do have the will I do have the will to take on evil and I assure you to
[14:25.500 --> 14:37.940]  do things that those that seek after darkness wish they could do but I tell
[14:37.940 --> 14:47.300]  you now I believe and I know in my heart that if every American could be made to
[14:47.300 --> 14:56.340]  sit down and watch the video that I saw yesterday of a three-year-old toddler
[14:56.340 --> 15:01.740]  with their entire lower jaw and mandible blown off and the neck ripped open
[15:01.740 --> 15:08.700]  with their tongue hanging out in a columbia necktie with that pulpy bloody
[15:08.700 --> 15:16.060]  hole slothing open with its crying anguish and absolute soul wrenching panic
[15:16.060 --> 15:24.580]  and pain with the little sister going into shock with her leg blown off right
[15:24.580 --> 15:33.060]  next to him if I could make every one of these people watch that who are in a
[15:33.060 --> 15:37.460]  trance who have been incrementally pushed into deeper and deeper levels of
[15:37.460 --> 15:44.980]  deception and spiritual blindness we could begin to turn the corner but
[15:44.980 --> 15:54.740]  that's why this entire structure this entire structure is about wrapping the
[15:54.740 --> 16:04.060]  world in false reality inserting people into a matrix with the jumbo trons and
[16:04.060 --> 16:13.220]  the advertisements in them the glamour the glitz the all of it is psychological
[16:13.220 --> 16:30.980]  warfare one hundred percent aimed at the species this is species death and what
[16:30.980 --> 16:44.260]  the architects of the New World Order have built is societal suicide and I have
[16:44.260 --> 16:51.940]  seen many many photos and many many videos of dead children and I've seen
[16:51.940 --> 16:55.980]  them once they're bandaged up with their arms and legs blown off in those
[16:55.980 --> 17:07.860]  facilities with their sad little eyes but to watch that child with its little
[17:07.860 --> 17:15.180]  lip its upper lip as little teeth and those eyes look just like my three-year-old
[17:15.180 --> 17:25.620]  daughter and that whole lower jaw and throat torn away and the little child
[17:25.620 --> 17:32.100]  has its hands out like this why it's it's it's just a horrible howl out of
[17:32.100 --> 17:39.660]  that hole why why and I talked to the military and their eyes glint and talk
[17:39.660 --> 17:44.020]  about turning places in the parking lots and how great drones are and how
[17:44.020 --> 17:47.900]  they'll kill 200 people to get one combatant and how it's worth it now
[17:47.900 --> 17:52.540]  that's what the good guys do and they actually think they're the good guys
[17:52.540 --> 18:02.340]  now that is deception this whole thing we're told is a humanitarian operation
[18:03.660 --> 18:08.620]  there's a law in the universe and the dark magicians that control our planet
[18:08.620 --> 18:15.300]  know this what comes around goes around you reap what you sow karma and I had
[18:15.300 --> 18:25.820]  an epiphany that that little child probably dead because there's no medical
[18:25.820 --> 18:36.580]  attention in cert where Gaddafi was that little child with their whole bottom of
[18:36.580 --> 18:39.580]  their face blown off
[18:51.740 --> 18:55.820]  I don't even have words to describe it
[18:55.820 --> 19:11.940]  that little child who's probably dead now a merciful fate is the lucky one
[19:12.580 --> 19:19.380]  because you reap what you sow our children by the millions now die over a
[19:19.380 --> 19:22.940]  year or two because their bodies are strong all the chemotherapy and the
[19:22.940 --> 19:27.980]  radiation tortures them month after month and as the globalist carry out a
[19:27.980 --> 19:33.660]  slow kill like a psychopath starving a child to death in a cage that's one of
[19:33.660 --> 19:40.380]  their favorite things to do and everything we do to those people and how
[19:40.380 --> 19:46.300]  we rationalize and make excuses the universe still will exact justice
[19:46.300 --> 19:52.060]  justice is being exacted on us in our country I can feel it the full hedge of
[19:52.060 --> 19:57.220]  protection is being removed America is going to be judged one thousand times

[25:42.860 --> 25:51.860]  again I want to address this video and audio in a way it's a kindness to the
[25:51.860 --> 25:55.860]  radio audience you'll only hear the
[25:55.860 --> 26:00.860]  jawless throatless screaming of the child
[26:00.860 --> 26:05.860]  and I had not even nightmares about it I just kept waking up thinking about it
[26:05.860 --> 26:11.860]  all night because when I got home I made my shelf go and seek out
[26:11.860 --> 26:16.860]  children all over the world with their legs blown off by landmines
[26:16.860 --> 26:21.860]  sometimes from wars 50 years before
[26:21.860 --> 26:25.860]  children hit by smart bombs
[26:25.860 --> 26:30.860]  and I began to find horrors even
[26:30.860 --> 26:35.860]  equaling what you are about to see your prison planet dot TV viewer I do
[26:35.860 --> 26:40.860]  suggest that you turn away if you don't want to see something that will
[26:40.860 --> 26:44.860]  affect you for the rest of your life because this isn't some zombie moving
[26:44.860 --> 26:48.860]  with a zombie missing its lower mandible
[26:48.860 --> 26:55.860]  this is a sweet little three-year-old I can't tell if it's a boy or girl
[26:55.860 --> 27:01.860]  has the same little sweet eyes as my three-year-old daughter
[27:01.860 --> 27:05.860]  and all of you that talk about turn it into a parking lot they could they can
[27:05.860 --> 27:09.860]  point any country Somalia sedan
[27:09.860 --> 27:15.860]  Pakistan Afghanistan I mean I could have a dartboard up here of any country and
[27:15.860 --> 27:18.860]  just throw a dart at it and it hits and the government says that's what the bad
[27:18.860 --> 27:24.860]  people are and Americans get up and salute and say parking lot
[27:24.860 --> 27:29.860]  I mean do you know what a parking lot is I mean I would respect you more if you
[27:29.860 --> 27:36.860]  went over like Joseph Mengele put in his own diary I don't like Joseph Mengele
[27:36.860 --> 27:41.860]  a very evil person the angel of death the Nazi experimenter
[27:41.860 --> 27:47.860]  but he would kill the children right up close and one morning he his driver he
[27:47.860 --> 27:52.860]  loaded up six little kids in this big Mercedes limousine and drove him about a
[27:52.860 --> 27:57.860]  mile out in the woods outside the base and he all gave him chocolate bars
[27:57.860 --> 28:01.860]  whatever reason watched him eat it and then sat there and shot him each in the
[28:01.860 --> 28:05.860]  head and of course he did worse things than that boiling him alive freezing
[28:05.860 --> 28:10.860]  people tearing him apart cutting their eyes out open waking brain surgery
[28:10.860 --> 28:15.860]  but see he's the he's Joseph Mengele he's a bad man
[28:15.860 --> 28:21.860]  he because he did it right up close but see if you on the bunch of al Qaeda
[28:21.860 --> 28:26.860]  rebels and put them in charge and have them just go street to street blowing up
[28:26.860 --> 28:35.860]  every building 40 to 50,000 innocent civilians dead they couldn't show one
[28:35.860 --> 28:43.860]  dead al Qaeda rebel fighter previous to the war getting launched six months ago
[28:43.860 --> 28:49.860]  but Gaddafi he looks like a bad guy you know a guy in a jogging suit looks like
[28:49.860 --> 28:55.860]  a clown to me but the real reason see this was done because Gaddafi was
[28:55.860 --> 29:02.860]  building up Africa Gaddafi actually was building up his people
[29:02.860 --> 29:08.860]  and he did have a secret police force and the rest of it and they did arrest
[29:08.860 --> 29:13.860]  people and hold them and they thought they were spies and beat them up
[29:13.860 --> 29:18.860]  not saying that's a good thing but on a scale of one to ten evil wise
[29:18.860 --> 29:23.860]  Gaddafi's about five people running our country about a ten
[29:23.860 --> 29:31.860]  but it's so slick though you see we're the good guys well who are we
[29:31.860 --> 29:35.860]  oh we're a country run by ruthless foreign banks that are destroying our
[29:35.860 --> 29:41.860]  future as well so so I'm gonna come back and try to cover this issue because I
[29:41.860 --> 29:45.860]  believe this little child and we don't know their name I want to discover it
[29:45.860 --> 29:49.860]  with their lower mandible blown off is the key to unlocking hearts we're on

[34:37.860 --> 34:42.860]  incredible thing is once you've bought into that we're the good guys and you
[34:42.860 --> 34:47.860]  don't even know who we are who runs this country who runs this world you don't
[34:47.860 --> 34:50.860]  even read the handbooks written by the globalists where they admit it's a cold
[34:50.860 --> 34:55.860]  blooded global depopulation program one day they tell you we're doing all this to
[34:55.860 --> 35:03.860]  fight al Qaeda and then al Qaeda is put in charge of Libya and now Egypt and the
[35:03.860 --> 35:08.860]  betrayal of the western back dictator who's a mubarak who wasn't perfect but
[35:08.860 --> 35:13.860]  compared to what they got now was an angel Gaddafi who actually tried to build
[35:13.860 --> 35:18.860]  up Africa you could say it was arrogance or that he actually cared I know the
[35:18.860 --> 35:23.860]  Africans loved him I know he was the only person that would try to build things
[35:23.860 --> 35:27.860]  in Africa that actually help people you know in the 50s and 60s Africa actually
[35:27.860 --> 35:34.860]  had cities and universities and all been destroyed now and I always hear this
[35:34.860 --> 35:39.860]  well that's because the the colonials pulled out no no that's because the
[35:39.860 --> 35:44.860]  colonials went in when they were getting kicked out and finance groups to engage
[35:44.860 --> 35:48.860]  in rebellion and destroy the place you can get anybody to start killing each
[35:48.860 --> 35:57.860]  other and yeah Africans like war like any other group of humans they got the same
[35:57.860 --> 36:01.860]  buttons everybody else has and they sure got pushed and now those buttons are
[36:01.860 --> 36:06.860]  going to get pushed here economically societally to play us all off against
[36:06.860 --> 36:10.860]  each other and bring this nation in this world down into the hands of the
[36:10.860 --> 36:18.860]  globalist are you seeing what's happening Google releases their transparency
[36:18.860 --> 36:30.860]  report itself created by DARPA on record I would praise this because it's been
[36:30.860 --> 36:33.860]  leaked from Yahoo a few years ago they won't release it but their own employees
[36:33.860 --> 36:38.860]  leaked it so I commend those folks but Google released a transparency report as
[36:38.860 --> 36:42.860]  you know three days ago Paul Watson was the first to get articles out and dig
[36:42.860 --> 36:47.860]  through it now others have and it turns out police quote order YouTube to
[36:47.860 --> 36:52.860]  take down videos because it quote shows them in a bad light they're very honest
[36:52.860 --> 36:57.860]  with Google in the file engine go read them the federal government tells them
[36:57.860 --> 37:02.860]  take down videos because they're critical of the government when they order
[37:02.860 --> 37:09.860]  YouTube to do this Google's parent company through Google YouTube YouTube
[37:09.860 --> 37:17.860]  complies with it so I guess the Federal Reserve when it called up two weeks ago
[37:17.860 --> 37:24.860]  and said take this video down to Alex Jones at the San Antonio Fed it's
[37:24.860 --> 37:29.860]  still before their review board I don't know they say if you force a review and
[37:29.860 --> 37:33.860]  they rule against it you can lose the channel one strike usually get three
[37:33.860 --> 37:37.860]  we're talking about something that's reached 150 million people that one
[37:37.860 --> 37:41.860]  channel that's going to reach even more in the next year it's growing
[37:41.860 --> 37:46.860]  exponentially now that's a major TV channel in any city that's had that many
[37:46.860 --> 37:51.860]  views I mean go look at it we've had hacks of the side every form of
[37:51.860 --> 37:59.860]  chicanery you can imagine and now they've introduced the legislation which is
[37:59.860 --> 38:03.860]  mirrors the global treaty remember the secret copyright treaty earlier this
[38:03.860 --> 38:08.860]  year that came out that Obama wants where no judge no jury if a corporation
[38:08.860 --> 38:16.860]  says you've infringed in word in video in anything you your site is taken not
[38:16.860 --> 38:23.860]  just deleted they can take it and sell it asset for future seizure no judge no
[38:23.860 --> 38:27.860]  jury just like cops under Admiralty pull over old ladies it's in the news all
[38:27.860 --> 38:32.860]  the time why do you have $3,000 they ask a depression era woman she says because
[38:32.860 --> 38:39.860]  I always carry a lot of cash when I'm traveling well I'm taking it people
[38:39.860 --> 38:44.860]  say how do they do that well it's presumed you're guilty because the cops
[38:44.860 --> 38:50.860]  have been told that's the law it's not it's totally unconstitutional you know
[38:50.860 --> 38:57.860]  everybody knows checkpoints are illegal but now all over the country
[38:57.860 --> 39:01.860]  sometimes I get in arguments with Ventura you know we're good friends now
[39:01.860 --> 39:06.860]  but he's something will shock him so much and you can see him not not again
[39:06.860 --> 39:11.860]  not more and he's like yeah I'm not missing driving I mean I'm not missing
[39:11.860 --> 39:16.860]  flying I'm enjoying driving Marvy around and so letting her my court case with
[39:16.860 --> 39:20.860]  the first to know when the judge rules it goes forward I said you know the TSA
[39:20.860 --> 39:24.860]  checking up check setting up checkpoints on the highways and he said come on
[39:24.860 --> 39:31.860]  Alex you know you're joking with me that's totally unconstitutional and I
[39:31.860 --> 39:34.860]  would have heard about it and I said well it hadn't gotten a lot of news but
[39:34.860 --> 39:37.860]  it's you know it's been in some newspapers it's been on television but
[39:37.860 --> 39:42.860]  they basically say it's a good thing the TSA is now federalizing local police
[39:42.860 --> 39:46.860]  and setting up checkpoints where everybody searched and in some cases
[39:46.860 --> 39:49.860]  they're frisking people and they're driving them through big x-ray machines
[39:49.860 --> 39:55.860]  with no shielding and he's looking at me he goes no I don't believe it no no
[39:55.860 --> 40:02.860]  no so I got my iPad and we're sitting up there in a hotel suite they're about
[40:02.860 --> 40:06.860]  to shoot an interview he's about to do with somebody and he reads it he
[40:06.860 --> 40:14.860]  watches the newscast he goes he goes wow and I said well you know it's gonna be
[40:14.860 --> 40:17.860]  phased in over a while and he goes no I drive a lot so I'm gonna run into these
[40:17.860 --> 40:23.860]  and he said I'm just gonna keep driving and no one him he will he said I you
[40:23.860 --> 40:26.860]  know what this is unconstitutional I haven't done anything wrong I'm just
[40:26.860 --> 40:32.860]  gonna keep driving and and that shows you where this society is going and about
[40:32.860 --> 40:36.860]  an hour later we eat and we're eating dinner and he's just shaking his head
[40:36.860 --> 40:42.860]  going you know is there any hope Alex there's always hope if we can break the
[40:42.860 --> 40:47.860]  trance there's always hope you want hour later hour and a half later he was
[40:47.860 --> 40:53.860]  now really thinking about it he goes I guess they are doing this I mean
[40:53.860 --> 40:57.860]  they're already putting us in microwave ovens groping us putting their hands
[40:57.860 --> 41:06.860]  in our pants and it's that realization it not only can happen here it is
[41:06.860 --> 41:21.860]  happening here we're going down the razor blade into the sea of alcohol we are
[41:21.860 --> 41:29.860]  slipping down into the abyss and we have the most wicked most macabre most
[41:29.860 --> 41:35.860]  sadistic most twisted elites and I've studied history that the world has ever
[41:35.860 --> 41:44.860]  had we've got the worst of the worst of the worst of the worst of the most
[41:44.860 --> 41:54.860]  sickeningly vicious and bloodthirsty and wicked inventors of evil that the
[41:54.860 --> 42:00.860]  world has ever seen the most duplicitous hundreds of layers of deception and
[42:00.860 --> 42:11.860]  twisting just absolute abject total portal to hell running this world pure
[42:11.860 --> 42:19.860]  death destruction for all the servants of evil and they advertise they're going
[42:19.860 --> 42:23.860]  to kill at least 90% and that's just to fool the 10% they think they're going
[42:23.860 --> 42:26.860]  to still be around when you get into higher level writings of the elite they
[42:26.860 --> 42:32.860]  discuss whether they should kill all humans and they discuss they're being
[42:32.860 --> 42:37.860]  too globalist left and then basically having a fight to the death with
[42:37.860 --> 42:48.860]  swords I mean whoa whoa that's who runs things and you think all these wars
[42:48.860 --> 42:53.860]  and all this torture and evil is for Al Qaeda I knew a decade ago and then I
[42:53.860 --> 42:57.860]  got the documents three years ago and broke it nationally I got a call from
[42:57.860 --> 43:00.860]  Ron Paul's office I got a call from Chuck Baldwin's office because they were
[43:00.860 --> 43:04.860]  in it and they're like Alex is this really real and I'm of course it's real
[43:04.860 --> 43:07.860]  that's here on a terrorist list and they tell cops if you've got an American
[43:07.860 --> 43:11.860]  flag on your bumper you know that says get us out of the you and you're a
[43:11.860 --> 43:14.860]  terrorist of course it's real because the feds took a week to admit it was
[43:14.860 --> 43:18.860]  real I said look at that control code on the bottom I called the FBI they
[43:18.860 --> 43:25.860]  started threatening me asking me how I got it and I said I got it from people
[43:25.860 --> 43:34.860]  inside that was with the federal master document and of course it was the Mayak
[43:34.860 --> 43:43.860]  that state police sent me and when you get these documents they're not talking
[43:43.860 --> 43:47.860]  about Al Qaeda ladies and gentlemen they're talking about people that can
[43:47.860 --> 43:51.860]  skin a buck and run a trot line they're talking about people that love freedom
[43:51.860 --> 43:55.860]  they're talking about people that aren't in the matrix they are scared of
[43:55.860 --> 43:59.860]  veterans the number one threat is a veteran and here's these veterans
[43:59.860 --> 44:03.860]  empowering this whole evil structure because of the brainwashing cover story
[44:03.860 --> 44:07.860]  and the minute you get out you are their number one enemy if they can't recruit
[44:07.860 --> 44:11.860]  you to be a cop and they do the psychological testing and they've got
[44:11.860 --> 44:16.860]  your record they're not going to accept you if you showed concern when the
[44:16.860 --> 44:20.860]  helicopter blew up the car full of kids for no reason I found out they do
[44:20.860 --> 44:25.860]  reports you see that Apache helicopter shoot up the Reuters van little kids in
[44:25.860 --> 44:29.860]  it and then and then army soldiers run over and get the kids you hear them on
[44:29.860 --> 44:33.860]  the radio I got kids I got kids and you hear the helicopter guys laughing
[44:33.860 --> 44:36.860]  whatever that's what you get coming to a battle it's not a battle they're out in
[44:36.860 --> 44:42.860]  the middle of the city Reuters camera guys after kids with them but but again
[44:42.860 --> 44:45.860]  the point is the guys actually on the ground that have got to see the kids
[44:45.860 --> 44:52.860]  you know shot by the high-powered gun on the nose of that thing they're actually
[44:52.860 --> 44:57.860]  down there with the people but you've got the guys back you know 800 yards a
[44:57.860 --> 45:02.860]  thousand yards and and there I look at those guys I mean that's when you hear
[45:02.860 --> 45:07.860]  them start going whatever you because they hear that the army on the ground
[45:07.860 --> 45:11.860]  the army soldiers going we got kids you know you know get me a medevac
[45:11.860 --> 45:15.860]  immediately they're hurt bad then and they're and they're running with them and
[45:15.860 --> 45:20.860]  you hear the guys who are separated from it up there and again you know the
[45:20.860 --> 45:23.860]  you know the good thing is if they would have really gotten off on it would
[45:23.860 --> 45:26.860]  mean they've already lost their souls no they they have to well it's what you
[45:26.860 --> 45:32.860]  get going to a battle zone to to salve their soul but see if they don't
[45:32.860 --> 45:38.860]  repent they will be brought into deeper levels of darkness you have got listen
[45:38.860 --> 45:42.860]  this whole modern warfare system this they admit the Pentagon develop video
[45:42.860 --> 45:47.860]  games for instinctive shooting so you dehumanize targets all the violence on
[45:47.860 --> 45:53.860]  television is admittedly to desensitize you that's why when the Marines through
[45:53.860 --> 45:59.860]  the puppy a few years ago they grab it it's crying they throw it off the cliff
[45:59.860 --> 46:03.860]  and laugh and there's hundreds of these with a torture animals to death you
[46:03.860 --> 46:08.860]  know these videos Michelle Malcolm came out and said I was a liar and then it
[46:08.860 --> 46:14.860]  was a toy dog and then I basically worked for al-qaeda and all these idiots
[46:14.860 --> 46:18.860]  said look how it's feeder up that's a toy you ever held a dog up by its scruff
[46:18.860 --> 46:21.860]  that's how they want to be moved on their puppies that's how their mother
[46:21.860 --> 46:25.860]  carries them they hold their feet up it was clearly a fat little fat little lab
[46:25.860 --> 46:32.860]  puppy mix and they lied and lied and got so upset and said I was a liar for
[46:32.860 --> 46:37.860]  popularizing that video because our troops wouldn't do that really really
[46:37.860 --> 46:42.860]  there aren't psychopaths in there that enjoy it because our troops wouldn't do
[46:42.860 --> 46:45.860]  that they had to say I was the liar and then the Marine Corps came out and said
[46:45.860 --> 46:50.860]  no he's being disciplined it would it really happened and the neocon still
[46:50.860 --> 46:54.860]  came out and said it was fake because it was psychological warfare because we've
[46:54.860 --> 47:04.860]  seen so many deaths of simulated deaths and real deaths of humans that it
[47:04.860 --> 47:09.860]  doesn't affect us anymore we've seen more simulated deaths that our subconscious
[47:09.860 --> 47:16.860]  takes is real than a doc howl executioner in Nazi Germany or a Soviet
[47:16.860 --> 47:28.860]  commandant over an extermination camp we have seen more simulated death than the
[47:28.860 --> 47:37.860]  most hardcore soldiers in history have seen people think it's entertainment I've
[47:37.860 --> 47:40.860]  been at violent films while people are being killed and tortured and people are
[47:40.860 --> 47:44.860]  laughing eating eating eating popcorn of course when that person gets in a car
[47:44.860 --> 47:48.860]  wreck and is all wound up in metal and their legs your legs chopped off beneath
[47:48.860 --> 47:55.860]  them it's not gonna be funny then or let's say somebody mugs you and and and
[47:55.860 --> 47:59.860]  and takes a steel pipe across your teeth and knocks your teeth out and then
[47:59.860 --> 48:03.860]  takes it in alley and starts raping you see it's not gonna be funny then huh or
[48:03.860 --> 48:07.860]  let's say God forbid you're in a car wreck and the car rolls and you get out
[48:07.860 --> 48:11.860]  and your three-year-old your three-year-old's face is ripped off is it
[48:11.860 --> 48:17.860]  gonna be popcorn time then huh you see that's the real world and that's what
[48:17.860 --> 48:23.860]  men get angry at and don't like because we want our people to be safe we want
[48:23.860 --> 48:27.860]  we want decency and honor and purity and what's good not because we're
[48:27.860 --> 48:32.860]  perfect but because we're reaching to be good we know how fallen we are and we
[48:32.860 --> 48:36.860]  know the minute we don't reach and try to be good and reach for the stars and
[48:36.860 --> 48:41.860]  reach for what's good that our civilization is swept away into a road warrior
[48:41.860 --> 48:45.860]  scenario of pain and destruction that our country is being used as the battle
[48:45.860 --> 48:51.860]  acts by this wicked system worldwide to bring devastation and destruction to
[48:51.860 --> 48:57.860]  innocence across the world and that spiritual psychic energy that those
[48:57.860 --> 49:03.860]  chains and weights are being bound around our nation's name and our nation's
[49:03.860 --> 49:09.860]  souls nations have a spirit and it's being bound to us unless we denounce it
[49:09.860 --> 49:15.860]  publicly and privately hit our knees and wretch before God in repentance that
[49:15.860 --> 49:19.860]  we have not done more that's why I don't want you call it up tell me what a good
[49:19.860 --> 49:24.860]  job I've done I've done a horrible job I should be in sackcloth living in a dirt
[49:24.860 --> 49:30.860]  hole when I'm not here thinking about the innocence that are being destroyed
[49:30.860 --> 49:35.860]  not not not destroyed by the world eating big fat steaks with a pot belly
[49:35.860 --> 49:41.860]  and even that attacks and destroys me we should all learn to recognize that what
[49:41.860 --> 49:45.860]  comes around goes around and it's not because we're wimps that we can't handle
[49:45.860 --> 49:51.860]  seeing the child with his face blown off it's because we have souls and can see
[49:51.860 --> 49:55.860]  what it is you think it's tough to think it's cute and the laugh about that and
[49:55.860 --> 50:01.860]  the minute you do that you literally open doors for every form of destruction
[50:01.860 --> 50:05.860]  to come against you and your family and you're not safe even when you recognize
[50:05.860 --> 50:11.860]  it all and say no to it remember that but you're a lot safer than you are when
[50:11.860 --> 50:15.860]  you embrace it you people wonder why your lives are so cursed you new listeners

[50:24.860 --> 50:29.860]  been sucking at the breast of a devilish new world order system you've been
