[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:00.930]  We're good to go.
[00:00:34.508 --> 00:00:35.929]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:37.550]  It is May 19, 2008.
[00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.792]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:44.694]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.694 --> 00:00:50.717]  Congressman Ron Paul is scheduled to be joining us later in this hour.
[00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:56.540]  Then we have Dr. Henry McCown joining us in the second hour to talk about the history of feminism.
[00:00:57.529 --> 00:01:07.681]  And to get into how it was orchestrated by the government and the Tax-Free Foundations to break down the families and enslave women, children, men alike.
[00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:12.227]  And then Alan Snidow will be joining us.
[00:01:12.227 --> 00:01:16.472]  He made the film Thirst, and we're going to be going over
[00:01:17.324 --> 00:01:27.811]  How big foreign companies are coming in, paying off politicians, buying the water supplies and water treatment facilities we paid for with tax money, and then doubling, tripling, quadrupling.
[00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:33.795]  We're talking about going from a $240 bill to a $1,275 bill.
[00:01:33.795 --> 00:01:37.457]  We're talking about going from a $80 bill to a $900 bill.
[00:01:37.457 --> 00:01:39.519]  I mean, these are real bills.
[00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:41.060]  And this is just what they do.
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.222]  And they all hire their private SWAT teams and siege forces
[00:01:45.143 --> 00:01:45.643]  The U.S.
[00:01:45.643 --> 00:01:46.683]  is being subdivided.
[00:01:46.683 --> 00:01:58.306]  It's going to be ruled by different local chieftains, overseen by Homeland Security, local Merck teams, armies of convicted felons filling the military and police forces.
[00:01:58.306 --> 00:01:59.786]  It's already happening.
[00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:03.347]  Ladies and gentlemen, the criminals are taking us down.
[00:02:03.347 --> 00:02:04.387]  They're just taking over.
[00:02:04.387 --> 00:02:06.647]  They're hitting us at every angle.
[00:02:06.647 --> 00:02:12.909]  Last night, I showed Truth Rising, and people are coming up to me, talking to me, and this fellow came up and showed me his phone.
[00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:13.989]  Real nice individual.
[00:02:14.662 --> 00:02:18.745]  You see he was driving down South Lamar and police pulled him over.
[00:02:18.745 --> 00:02:22.207]  They had a drug dog and he admitted he had a tenth of an ounce of marijuana.
[00:02:22.207 --> 00:02:25.430]  He smokes marijuana like George Washington did.
[00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.272]  And they're standing there and the dog just runs right up and bites his leg.
[00:02:29.272 --> 00:02:31.734]  And I've seen many videos of this where they just bite you.
[00:02:31.734 --> 00:02:34.996]  It's kind of like the cop will kind of not really pull on the leash.
[00:02:34.996 --> 00:02:36.737]  It's kind of like, oh go ahead get a little blood.
[00:02:36.737 --> 00:02:39.499]  And he showed me photos of these huge bite marks.
[00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:43.142]  And then more cops pull up at the scene and one pulls up and wrecks into another one.
[00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:46.587]  And they go, that's it, that was your fault.
[00:02:46.587 --> 00:02:49.329]  If you wouldn't have had this marijuana, we wouldn't have stopped, this wouldn't have happened.
[00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.570]  We're charging you with everything.
[00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.551]  We're charging you with, uh, you name it.
[00:02:54.551 --> 00:02:55.852]  I mean, that's how sick it is.
[00:02:55.852 --> 00:03:04.016]  I mean, would you rather have people smoking marijuana, or would you rather have fleets of goons and attack dogs running around, pulling us over, feeding on us?
[00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:06.738]  What's a greater evil?
[00:03:06.738 --> 00:03:08.599]  Hmm?
[00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.800]  What is a greater evil?
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.920]  And...
[00:03:13.937 --> 00:03:15.137]  We are Change, Kentucky.
[00:03:15.137 --> 00:03:16.098]  We are Change, Ohio.
[00:03:16.098 --> 00:03:17.618]  We're going to get them on later in the show today.
[00:03:17.618 --> 00:03:27.760]  I interviewed one of them, and then I was listening to Truthheart Revolution Radio last night driving home at like 11 o'clock and heard the other guys there, and they went to the NRA convention.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.901]  They had press passes.
[00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:37.883]  They went to the press briefing, press conference, and asked Oliver North about the FEMA Camp Continuity of Government plans, the concentration camp plans, and
[00:03:39.921 --> 00:03:42.403]  All of a sudden, plainclothes security came over and said, leave.
[00:03:42.403 --> 00:04:03.878]  And as they were leaving, one of them just grabbed the guy, tackled him, and then the police ran over with him, and Oliver North's private security were there, and they stole all their cameras, took the memory chips out, took the batteries out, erased them, didn't give them the chips or the batteries back, and then said, we're going to charge you with federal violations felonies,
[00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:24.918]  And we're making up all this stuff about obstruction of justice federally, by having the videos, and by trying to... One of them put one of the memory chips in his pocket before they could get to it, and they searched him and took it, and said, you're trying to... I mean, just made-up craziness.
[00:04:24.918 --> 00:04:27.278]  Just like a third-world country.
[00:04:27.278 --> 00:04:28.659]  They got a major lawsuit.
[00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:30.039]  They were press-accredited.
[00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:32.460]  I mean, are we gonna protect press in this country?
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.921]  Are we gonna protect activism?
[00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.252]  I mean, this is just off-the-chart serious to have that going on.
[00:04:42.252 --> 00:04:44.593]  And it's only gonna get worse.
[00:04:44.593 --> 00:04:54.035]  They are converting our society over to a giant gulag policed by steroid-headed psychos.
[00:04:54.035 --> 00:04:55.436]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:55.436 --> 00:04:58.277]  A new world order.
[00:04:58.277 --> 00:05:02.538]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:03.354 --> 00:05:05.976]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:05.976 --> 00:05:08.777]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:08.777 --> 00:05:11.959]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:19.264]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:22.304 --> 00:05:27.748]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:27.748 --> 00:05:31.630]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.192]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:34.192 --> 00:05:35.353]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:35.353 --> 00:05:36.133]  They're not after money.
[00:05:36.133 --> 00:05:37.414]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:37.414 --> 00:05:38.395]  They're after power.
[00:05:38.395 --> 00:05:39.556]  That's what they're after.

[00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:00.582]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[00:07:00.582 --> 00:07:06.523]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[00:07:06.523 --> 00:07:10.685]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[00:07:10.685 --> 00:07:15.566]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[00:07:15.786 --> 00:07:16.287]  We're good to go!

[00:08:04.361 --> 00:08:05.903]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:05.903 --> 00:08:10.106]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.106 --> 00:08:18.254]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:18.254 --> 00:08:22.798]  When you read about King George quartering standard standing armies,
[00:08:25.795 --> 00:08:34.749]  ...and erecting a multitude of new offices and officers to go out and eat out the substance of the people.
[00:08:34.749 --> 00:08:37.173]  The government that they had in 1775 and 1776 was per capita much, much smaller.
[00:08:42.594 --> 00:08:43.535]  Other than it is today.
[00:08:43.535 --> 00:09:01.750]  I mean, think about how you pay property tax, and sales tax, and income tax, and state income tax, and corporation tax, and business tax, and regulatory tax, and telecommunications tax, and water tax, and trash pickup tax, and taxes on taxes on taxes.
[00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.332]  I mean, there's thousands of taxes.
[00:09:04.713 --> 00:09:06.134]  And what do you get from the government?
[00:09:06.134 --> 00:09:11.017]  Just leering thugs in paramilitary outfits, shoving machine guns in your face.
[00:09:11.017 --> 00:09:18.062]  I mean, I watched over the weekend a Chicago TV station with the deputy chief
[00:09:18.815 --> 00:09:21.376]  Who looked like he was wearing a rubber mask.
[00:09:21.376 --> 00:09:24.078]  I mean, the guy looked like a space alien or something.
[00:09:24.078 --> 00:09:26.659]  And you could just tell he looked completely guilty.
[00:09:26.659 --> 00:09:29.140]  He looked like a bad guy out of a comic book.
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.842]  And his ears were almost on his neck.
[00:09:31.842 --> 00:09:33.683]  Bizarre looking fellow.
[00:09:33.683 --> 00:09:37.385]  And he was just saying, yeah, we're going to turn all of our police into SWAT teams.
[00:09:37.385 --> 00:09:41.867]  And they're going to be everywhere now in uniforms to project authority and strength.
[00:09:41.867 --> 00:09:47.490]  And they're going to be driving armored vehicles in all the neighborhoods and setting up checkpoints and questioning everyone.
[00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:49.090]  And I'm watching this.
[00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.151]  This is martial law.
[00:09:51.151 --> 00:09:54.772]  We're going to hand out, you know, M-16s to everybody.
[00:09:54.772 --> 00:09:56.913]  And we're going to do this.
[00:09:56.913 --> 00:09:58.174]  And it showed them.
[00:09:58.174 --> 00:10:04.556]  And it showed cops in black masks, black helmets, marching around with batons in Chicago.
[00:10:04.556 --> 00:10:07.917]  And it said, this is in response to increased crime.
[00:10:07.917 --> 00:10:13.519]  We've, you know, had 20 more murders so far this year than we had last year.
[00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:15.140]  Well, of course you've had more murders.
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.120]  You're a crime capital.
[00:10:16.747 --> 00:10:19.969]  The son of a famous mob boss runs Chicago.
[00:10:19.969 --> 00:10:24.912]  I mean, this is the city where the police publicly shake down the businesses themselves.
[00:10:24.912 --> 00:10:31.077]  This is where Al Capone ran the police, and then Daley ran the police, and then now his son runs the police.
[00:10:31.077 --> 00:10:34.599]  I mean, there's not even a debate about it.
[00:10:34.599 --> 00:10:35.660]  And they rule.
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:41.263]  And if you cross a cop in Chicago, they'll just pull you out of the car, blow your head off in front of everybody.
[00:10:41.263 --> 00:10:42.024]  Do it all the time.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.081]  I mean, it's like, hey!
[00:10:44.081 --> 00:10:45.001]  Listen, scum!
[00:10:45.001 --> 00:10:45.801]  We rule!
[00:10:45.801 --> 00:10:47.362]  Shut your filthy mouth!
[00:10:47.362 --> 00:10:54.184]  Off-duty cops beat women, rape them in bars, just, and it's just, it's just, it's a reign of terror and evil.
[00:10:54.184 --> 00:10:59.846]  And it's only gonna intensify, and of course a mafia-run city is going to have gun confiscation.
[00:10:59.846 --> 00:11:01.487]  Of course guns are banned in Chicago.
[00:11:02.631 --> 00:11:10.474]  And in the surrounding state, they spend a large portion of their state police budget, I've seen it as high as 30%, in quote, gun crime enforcement.
[00:11:10.474 --> 00:11:30.662]  And what happens is their favorite target, this has been in the news with the Illinois Rifle Association over and over again, State Rifle Association, and they will, as soon as some 85, 86, 92 year old man's had a stroke, he goes in, he's back home, his family's taking care of him, the day after his gun registration card
[00:11:31.491 --> 00:11:33.092]  No, what you are is cancer!
[00:11:56.235 --> 00:12:04.158]  And you've got every billboard and TV ad paid for about how great you are and how you're gonna... And see, Americans have been domesticated slowly.
[00:12:04.158 --> 00:12:08.999]  First, it was, hey, in the 30s, these trucks are driving on the road and they're messing the road up with their heavy weight.
[00:12:08.999 --> 00:12:10.000]  Shouldn't we tax them?
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.440]  And the dumb citizens said, yeah, tax them, rich truck drivers.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.701]  It was a class thing.
[00:12:14.701 --> 00:12:17.482]  Because we're having to pay for the roads and your trucks are heavier and they're messing them up.
[00:12:18.303 --> 00:12:19.464]  They had to have licenses.
[00:12:19.464 --> 00:12:22.907]  And then they said, oh, now you gotta have them, which the Supreme Court rulings actually say you don't.
[00:12:22.907 --> 00:12:23.527]  But they don't care.
[00:12:23.527 --> 00:12:25.829]  The cops are now saying the Second Amendment's a privilege.
[00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:26.289]  They don't know.
[00:12:26.289 --> 00:12:28.091]  They think travel's a privilege, too.
[00:12:28.091 --> 00:12:28.551]  It's not.
[00:12:28.551 --> 00:12:30.012]  It's a right.
[00:12:30.012 --> 00:12:32.915]  Unless you're in a controlled military grid, which we've been under since 33.
[00:12:32.915 --> 00:12:35.236]  Now it's just expanding.
[00:12:35.236 --> 00:12:36.577]  Took a long time to bring down the country.
[00:12:36.577 --> 00:12:37.178]  They've now done it.
[00:12:37.912 --> 00:13:00.960]  And you know, there's just everywhere, click it or tick it, giant signs on skyscrapers in Austin, and every other billboard, images of cops pulling people over, that they're the big guys, they're the boss, they're gonna... You're gonna be pulled over, and now you're gonna get 10 years in prison for speeding, and now you're gonna get a year in jail for dropping a banana peel, and now you're gonna... You know, you do anything wrong.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.181]  Oh, your child, uh...
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.641]  Fell off the swing in front of witnesses and broke their arm.
[00:13:05.641 --> 00:13:07.341]  CPS comes out every time.
[00:13:07.341 --> 00:13:08.742]  Break a finger if they come out now.
[00:13:08.742 --> 00:13:10.242]  All about government, you're alive.
[00:13:10.242 --> 00:13:11.642]  All about government questioning you.
[00:13:11.642 --> 00:13:17.624]  All about government bossing you around in your face.
[00:13:17.624 --> 00:13:20.245]  This is what they're doing.
[00:13:20.245 --> 00:13:23.326]  And it's gonna get worse.
[00:13:23.326 --> 00:13:25.006]  And worse.
[00:13:25.006 --> 00:13:26.046]  And worse.
[00:13:26.046 --> 00:13:26.887]  And worse.
[00:13:26.887 --> 00:13:27.647]  And worse.
[00:13:27.647 --> 00:13:29.687]  And worse.
[00:13:29.687 --> 00:13:31.908]  Before I digress and forget about it, this is all I'm gonna say.
[00:13:33.996 --> 00:13:37.259]  I think all you no-planers ought to really be proud of yourselves.
[00:13:37.259 --> 00:13:47.466]  Those of you that are weak-minded and have followed the different feds that have put that out, the no-planes at the towers, you ought to really be proud of yourselves because Howard Stern has now given a no-planer a show on his network.
[00:13:47.466 --> 00:13:50.008]  That's what the establishment is doing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:50.008 --> 00:13:53.391]  That's what you've done to this country.
[00:13:53.391 --> 00:13:55.613]  You're not going to stop 9-11 Truth.
[00:13:55.613 --> 00:13:58.375]  It's one of the only effective attacks the enemy has launched.
[00:13:59.665 --> 00:14:04.066]  But people are getting sophisticated now and realizing exactly what you're doing.
[00:14:04.066 --> 00:14:10.207]  If you can't beat us on the facts, you will then magnify kook 9-11 groups to then make us all look bad.
[00:14:10.207 --> 00:14:12.207]  It's called black propaganda.
[00:14:12.207 --> 00:14:13.908]  And it's not going to work.
[00:14:13.908 --> 00:14:22.749]  That's all I'm going to say on that subject, but people tell me I don't like Howard Stern, and he's had Bopabooey call in here, whatever that twit's name, and it was him.
[00:14:22.749 --> 00:14:23.750]  They bragged about it.
[00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:24.790]  They don't like this show.
[00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:25.730]  They've called me before.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:35.604]  Repeatedly, the Howard Stern Show has, and vetted me to come on, and I just basically told them, you know, I don't need to be, you know, told I need to come on and act stupid.
[00:14:35.604 --> 00:14:37.105]  Hey, you want to come on and act stupid?
[00:14:37.105 --> 00:14:38.826]  We only want you on here to come on and act stupid.
[00:14:38.826 --> 00:14:40.046]  Now, I don't want to come on and act stupid.
[00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:41.167]  See, I'm not like that.
[00:14:41.167 --> 00:14:45.749]  I won't geek for you so I can get attention to destroy this country.
[00:14:45.749 --> 00:14:52.792]  Understand, that's not how this works, and it's a despicable thing, and people should cancel their XM serious contracts because of it.
[00:14:52.792 --> 00:14:55.394]  You've got it, you should call them and cancel it.
[00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:56.174]  It's disgusting.
[00:14:58.268 --> 00:15:01.470]  Nothing but sucking this country down in the pit of hell.
[00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:03.932]  As prices rise... Listen to this.
[00:15:03.932 --> 00:15:05.954]  This is where our country is, New York Times.
[00:15:05.954 --> 00:15:09.356]  As prices rise, crime tipsters work overtime.
[00:15:09.356 --> 00:15:09.717]  That's right.
[00:15:09.717 --> 00:15:14.180]  1 in 10 college grads not to be in Homeland Security related.
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:19.444]  We're now going to have just masses, millions and millions of new bureaucrats running around everywhere.
[00:15:19.444 --> 00:15:21.165]  There's tattletale tip lines everywhere.
[00:15:21.165 --> 00:15:23.487]  Let me explain something.
[00:15:24.861 --> 00:15:32.947]  You put your kids in the car, and then you jump out of the car and close the door and get mail out of the mailbox?
[00:15:32.947 --> 00:15:36.189]  The old woman next door, she doesn't even necessarily want the money.
[00:15:36.189 --> 00:15:46.717]  She just sits around watching drama shows and TV shows where CPS are the heroes, and where they show them Pavlovianly, people calling CPS on folks, and they're wanting to call authorities.
[00:15:46.717 --> 00:15:48.238]  They like to be patted on the head.
[00:15:48.238 --> 00:15:53.222]  It's a childish feeling of being good, and they're gonna call on you.
[00:15:54.834 --> 00:16:02.278]  You yell and scream at your wife in the backyard, get in a fight, just yelling, police are coming, you're going to go to jail.
[00:16:02.278 --> 00:16:04.420]  They get money to do that.
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:13.366]  You need to understand, and this is just the beginning, this is just the beginning, because this is going to be the new economy.
[00:16:13.366 --> 00:16:15.147]  I've read federal documents on this subject.
[00:16:16.283 --> 00:16:21.126]  Your high school graduates will all have to serve a year in Stasi Corps domestically.
[00:16:21.126 --> 00:16:22.828]  They're going to be the new youth corps of the government.
[00:16:22.828 --> 00:16:27.071]  Can you imagine all these 18 and 19-year-old punks on power trips now?
[00:16:27.071 --> 00:16:30.333]  Oh, it's wearing gray uniforms.
[00:16:30.333 --> 00:16:31.614]  Oh yeah, that was before 9-11.
[00:16:31.614 --> 00:16:33.135]  They were training them all over the country for that.
[00:16:33.135 --> 00:16:35.156]  Homeland Security now moving into all the major schools.
[00:16:35.156 --> 00:16:37.918]  A lot of idiot parents are proud of it.
[00:16:37.918 --> 00:16:39.139]  My son's very serious now.
[00:16:39.139 --> 00:16:41.441]  He takes his new Hitler youth duties very seriously.
[00:16:44.705 --> 00:16:55.025]  The gas prices, foreclosure rates, and the cost of rice add this rising economic indicator the number of tips to the police from people hoping to collect reward money.
[00:16:56.656 --> 00:16:57.176]  That's right.
[00:16:57.176 --> 00:17:03.219]  Calls to the Southwest Florida Crime Stoppers hotline in the first quarter of this year were up 30% over last year.
[00:17:03.219 --> 00:17:05.660]  San Antonio had a 44% increase.
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:19.146]  Cities and towns from Detroit to Omaha to Beaumont County, North Carolina all report at least a 25% or more in the first quarter with tipsters telling operators they need money for rent, light bulbs, or baby formula.
[00:17:19.146 --> 00:17:20.107]  And it shows they beg.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:34.128]  And they're going online and finding law books, and they're just watching neighbors like a cobra watches a rat, just sitting there in the bushes waiting to have that meal.
[00:17:34.128 --> 00:17:38.410]  And you have to understand, this is how policy is formed.
[00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:40.031]  This is all socially engineered.
[00:17:40.031 --> 00:17:42.032]  A local cop doesn't even know it.
[00:17:42.032 --> 00:17:43.333]  Again, they're just compartmentalized.
[00:17:44.215 --> 00:17:50.056]  That when your car gets stolen, your house gets broken into, you can't get the police out in Dallas or Austin, Texas, and other areas of the country.
[00:17:50.056 --> 00:17:52.177]  But I can tell you, I've lived in both.
[00:17:52.177 --> 00:18:05.800]  And, uh, I mean, I remember being 18, 19 years old, visiting an old girlfriend in Dallas, like I said, and somebody stole my car, and the cops wouldn't come out, and I said, fine, and hung the phone up, and then they showed up, threatening me, saying, why'd you hang up on 9-11, and started searching her apartment.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.761]  They just walked in, opened the door, and they just walked in.
[00:18:10.692 --> 00:18:12.133]  It's, it's so horrible.
[00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:30.079]  Because, but, but, you call and report a box on the side of the street, they'll come out and freak out with robots and have news cameras because it's all about them posing that there's terrorists and there's fear and, and always giving in to every tattletale, every little, little spy op.
[00:18:30.079 --> 00:18:31.839]  See, they only respond to tattletaling.
[00:18:31.839 --> 00:18:33.500]  They don't respond you've actually been violated.
[00:18:34.458 --> 00:18:38.979]  As prices rise, crime tipsters work overtime.
[00:18:38.979 --> 00:18:50.222]  It says, for this year, everyone that's called has pretty much just been looking for money, said Sergeant Lawrence Beller, who answers Crimestoppers calls at the Sussex County, New Jersey Sheriff's Office.
[00:18:50.222 --> 00:18:55.383]  That's as opposed to the last couple of years where people were just sick of crime and wanting to do something about it.
[00:18:55.383 --> 00:18:57.663]  Yeah, sure they were.
[00:18:57.663 --> 00:18:59.544]  They just would act like they were.
[00:18:59.544 --> 00:19:00.924]  Now they openly beg to you for money.
[00:19:01.616 --> 00:19:14.365]  As a result, many programs report a substantial increase in crime-related arrest and recovered property as callers turned in neighbors, grandchildren, that's right folks, they've trained this nation of cowardly scum.
[00:19:14.365 --> 00:19:16.727]  We are the ultimate filth.
[00:19:16.727 --> 00:19:18.568]  You think the Arabs turned their grandchildren in?
[00:19:18.568 --> 00:19:19.749]  Never.
[00:19:19.749 --> 00:19:22.471]  You think Mexicans in Mexico turned their family in?
[00:19:22.471 --> 00:19:23.652]  Never.
[00:19:23.652 --> 00:19:23.992]  Never.
[00:19:24.691 --> 00:19:29.092]  They may live in third world cesspits, but they don't turn in that blood.
[00:19:29.092 --> 00:19:32.833]  Only in the United States could they kill the instinct for family.
[00:19:32.833 --> 00:19:42.015]  Folks, I would cover up crimes if my family was involved.
[00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:44.595]  I mean, I'll admit it.
[00:19:44.595 --> 00:19:46.956]  You don't go against your family.
[00:19:46.956 --> 00:19:47.476]  I'll be right back.
[00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:57.543]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:19:57.543 --> 00:20:07.011]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:07.011 --> 00:20:14.117]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:14.818 --> 00:20:20.800]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:31.585]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:32.385 --> 00:20:32.705]  I think so.
[00:20:53.928 --> 00:21:07.073]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:21:07.073 --> 00:21:17.738]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:21:18.138 --> 00:21:21.559]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:21:21.559 --> 00:21:23.300]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:29.441]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:22:54.286 --> 00:22:57.229]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:57.229 --> 00:23:03.394]  Did you know that Communism has stated that America would not jump from Capitalism to Communism?
[00:23:03.394 --> 00:23:12.181]  That our elected leaders would pass laws to socialize America and one day we would wake up and have Socialism-Communism and not even know how it happened?
[00:23:12.181 --> 00:23:16.565]  Have we seen this very type of socialization of America over the last 60 years?
[00:23:17.586 --> 00:23:22.810]  We've been pushed far down the slippery slope of socialism, communism, and don't even know it.
[00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:25.231]  Just as Nikita Khrushchev said.
[00:23:25.231 --> 00:23:32.936]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:24:29.317 --> 00:24:34.378]  It's a good feeling to know the truth.
[00:24:34.378 --> 00:24:36.459]  And knowing how serious this world is.
[00:24:36.459 --> 00:24:42.460]  How life and death it really is.
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:47.841]  Makes all the baloney not matter anymore.
[00:24:47.841 --> 00:24:49.782]  The baubles, the trinkets, the status.
[00:24:51.414 --> 00:24:54.476]  The feeling inadequate like the average American does?
[00:24:54.476 --> 00:25:00.279]  I have my honor.
[00:25:00.279 --> 00:25:02.721]  I know I'm for real.
[00:25:02.721 --> 00:25:05.663]  I know that I love liberty and freedom.
[00:25:05.663 --> 00:25:12.046]  And I want to see my fellow countrymen be straight and strong and honorable.
[00:25:12.046 --> 00:25:16.169]  And I want to see a hatred of evil in the hearts of our people again.
[00:25:16.169 --> 00:25:20.712]  And a love of liberty and decency and purity and honor.
[00:25:23.809 --> 00:25:31.430]  Instead, we are a nation of white trash, scum, and every other form of trash you can imagine.
[00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:34.731]  We are degenerating fast.
[00:25:34.731 --> 00:25:37.932]  All we can try to do is have a survivable crash landing.
[00:25:37.932 --> 00:25:40.432]  This nation is crashing, we all know it.
[00:25:40.432 --> 00:25:42.332]  It began crashing when our morals failed.
[00:25:42.332 --> 00:25:45.693]  You have a moral, upstanding, strong, fighting country.
[00:25:45.693 --> 00:25:46.893]  That means fighting against tyranny.
[00:25:46.893 --> 00:25:48.354]  That means fighting for your rights.
[00:25:48.354 --> 00:25:49.354]  Fighting to work hard.
[00:25:49.354 --> 00:25:50.654]  Fighting to raise your children right.
[00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:56.453]  That's what built a country that was 4% of the world's population and more than half the wealth.
[00:25:56.453 --> 00:26:03.958]  And now we've been robbed, our wealth has been taken and used to energize a new world order, and now we're left with a bankrupted husk of what we were.
[00:26:03.958 --> 00:26:14.085]  I mean, I read this New York Times story, as prices rise, crime tipsters work overtime, and it's as families turn each other in for money.
[00:26:14.085 --> 00:26:15.266]  I see this all the time.
[00:26:15.266 --> 00:26:16.407]  It's so sick.
[00:26:18.692 --> 00:26:21.694]  Now, if I had family burying people in the basement, I'd call the police on them.
[00:26:21.694 --> 00:26:26.618]  But I mean, if it was these victimless crimes or something, or you'd go fix it with your family.
[00:26:26.618 --> 00:26:30.181]  You know, if somebody was doing something wrong, you'd go.
[00:26:30.181 --> 00:26:38.607]  Just hypothetically, you know, let's say you had a brother who had a methamphetamine lab, you'd go tear it apart and beat the hell out of him and tell him to never do it again.
[00:26:38.607 --> 00:26:40.368]  Then you'd call the police.
[00:26:40.368 --> 00:26:41.889]  You know, you'd try.
[00:26:41.889 --> 00:26:44.692]  There's that instinct to defend your family.
[00:26:44.692 --> 00:26:46.493]  And I can't believe you don't have that.
[00:26:49.136 --> 00:26:58.401]  I just can't understand because I see these parents just give their children up to CPS when the parents have done nothing wrong and they'll cry and be sad about it, but they're just, they've had their instinct cut off.
[00:26:58.401 --> 00:26:59.582]  Now the illegal aliens haven't.
[00:26:59.582 --> 00:27:00.943]  They run every time.
[00:27:00.943 --> 00:27:03.104]  So the CPS leaves them alone.
[00:27:03.104 --> 00:27:05.866]  Or they'll, they'll, they'll, they'll shoot.
[00:27:05.866 --> 00:27:07.206]  Or they'll stab.
[00:27:07.206 --> 00:27:09.428]  Because they have their heads screwed on straight.
[00:27:09.428 --> 00:27:10.828]  They're nationalistic.
[00:27:10.828 --> 00:27:11.689]  They're hardworking.
[00:27:12.702 --> 00:27:20.565]  They may not fight back against the tyranny of their government, because they've been enslaved so long, they don't think they can win, but at least they try all the time.
[00:27:20.565 --> 00:27:30.990]  I actually admire the illegal aliens, compared to what this country's turned into, because the illegal aliens won't turn their families in.
[00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:33.191]  It's disgusting.
[00:27:33.191 --> 00:27:35.492]  The Asians won't do it either.
[00:27:35.492 --> 00:27:38.693]  White trash, blacks,
[00:27:40.811 --> 00:27:43.053]  That's who turns their families in in this country.
[00:27:43.053 --> 00:27:47.258]  Black people and white people should be ashamed of ourselves.
[00:27:47.258 --> 00:27:49.840]  We should be ashamed of ourselves.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.622]  Ashamed of ourselves.
[00:27:51.622 --> 00:27:53.885]  Does that mean there aren't Hispanics that don't turn family in?
[00:27:53.885 --> 00:27:55.226]  Does that mean there aren't Asians?
[00:27:55.226 --> 00:27:56.627]  I've seen the crime statistics, though.
[00:27:56.627 --> 00:27:58.349]  There are not many.
[00:27:58.349 --> 00:27:59.891]  Shame on us!
[00:28:05.842 --> 00:28:10.065]  And it goes on to say, listen to this, I'm in a bind, I'm in a bind, this is recording.
[00:28:10.065 --> 00:28:15.968]  She told the hotline operator, there's a lot of stuff I know, but I, but I didn't open my mouth.
[00:28:15.968 --> 00:28:18.369]  If I weren't in a bind, I wouldn't open my mouth.
[00:28:18.369 --> 00:28:24.673]  When she learned the money was not available, she said she would call back when the whereabouts of another suspect whom she had seen going down the road.
[00:28:26.736 --> 00:28:51.318]  Ellen Cloyd, the president of Crime Stoppers USA, that is STASI, Destroy America USA, a national organization of local tip programs, said that not all the 323 programs in the country have reported an increase in calls, and that some, like those in Lafayette, Louisiana and Bowerd County, Florida, attributed most of their spike to increased publicity or technology improvements, like accepting tips by text message.
[00:28:51.318 --> 00:28:51.838]  You gotta love it.
[00:28:51.838 --> 00:28:53.580]  Somebody sends a text message in,
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.661]  And then they SWAT team your house.
[00:28:56.661 --> 00:29:01.983]  Every day I read about a SWAT team going to an insurance salesman's house, some old woman's house.
[00:29:01.983 --> 00:29:07.145]  You know, they'll shoot a 94-year-old woman 50-something times.
[00:29:07.145 --> 00:29:09.305]  It's just unbelievable, man.
[00:29:09.305 --> 00:29:12.586]  Unbelievable.
[00:29:12.586 --> 00:29:13.927]  This country's so far gone.
[00:29:16.118 --> 00:29:19.599]  And it just goes on to how people turn their families in for marijuana.
[00:29:19.599 --> 00:29:23.861]  Can you imagine turning your kid in because they're smoking marijuana because you want $500?
[00:29:23.861 --> 00:29:24.041]  $500!
[00:29:24.041 --> 00:29:34.024]  I would starve to death in a ditch before I called on my neighbors, much less my family.
[00:29:34.024 --> 00:29:40.627]  There's people I hate, who I know all sorts of bad stuff about, and I cannot make myself call reports in on them.
[00:29:40.627 --> 00:29:41.487]  I can't do it!
[00:29:43.891 --> 00:29:47.815]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:47.815 --> 00:29:54.161]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:54.161 --> 00:29:55.582]  It is a big idea.
[00:29:55.582 --> 00:29:58.424]  A new world order.
[00:29:58.424 --> 00:30:03.649]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:30:03.649 --> 00:30:06.152]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:30:06.152 --> 00:30:08.294]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:30:08.922 --> 00:30:12.085]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:30:12.085 --> 00:30:19.412]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:30:22.446 --> 00:30:27.870]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:31.753]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:30:31.753 --> 00:30:34.315]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:30:34.315 --> 00:30:35.476]  Most people have no idea.
[00:30:35.476 --> 00:30:36.277]  They're not after money.
[00:30:36.277 --> 00:30:37.538]  They have all the money they need.
[00:30:37.538 --> 00:30:38.258]  They're after power.
[00:30:38.258 --> 00:30:39.679]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:30:48.386 --> 00:30:49.167]  Endgame.
[00:30:49.167 --> 00:30:51.189]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:30:51.189 --> 00:30:52.350]  You have been warned.
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.661]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[00:30:55.661 --> 00:31:03.002]  I have been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[00:31:03.002 --> 00:31:08.604]  For the last three years, the Earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce, and it has now finally caught up with this.
[00:31:08.604 --> 00:31:15.545]  In the U.S., commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed, and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months.
[00:31:15.545 --> 00:31:22.147]  It's fall in the Southern Hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter, and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[00:31:22.952 --> 00:31:24.533]  Remember our trade deficit?
[00:31:24.533 --> 00:31:30.398]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price.
[00:31:30.398 --> 00:31:36.783]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under martial law.
[00:31:36.783 --> 00:31:38.264]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202.
[00:31:38.264 --> 00:31:38.344]  1-800-453-2202.

[00:31:53.286 --> 00:32:01.210]  Oral Products now is introducing the new Detoxer Foot and Body Pads that work while you're sleeping to pull heavy metals and toxins from the body.
[00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:09.273]  Our Detoxer Pads release unwanted toxins, relieve stress and pain, and improves the immune system, circulation, and blockages all while you're sleeping.
[00:32:09.273 --> 00:32:13.095]  Very simply, you put one pad on each foot before bedtime and go to sleep.
[00:32:13.095 --> 00:32:16.637]  And when you wake up, the toxins that are drawn out of the body will be in the pads.
[00:32:16.877 --> 00:32:18.878]  You peel them off and throw them away.
[00:32:18.878 --> 00:32:19.759]  It's that simple.
[00:32:19.759 --> 00:32:22.481]  Call 908-691-2608.
[00:32:22.481 --> 00:32:28.085]  We encourage our customers to detox in as many ways as possible to bring the body back to a balance.
[00:32:28.085 --> 00:32:31.207]  The average person is exposed to hundreds of chemicals daily.
[00:32:31.207 --> 00:32:34.049]  This is one of the many powerful ways to detox the body.
[00:32:34.249 --> 00:32:39.110]  We recommend you try our Detoxer Foot Pads and see and feel the difference for yourself.
[00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:41.811]  Call today at 1-908-691-2608.

[00:32:47.513 --> 00:32:48.313]  Call today.

[00:33:18.035 --> 00:33:32.464]  Livin' on the road, my friend Was gonna keep you free and clean And now you wear your skin like iron And your breath as hard as kerosene
[00:33:39.821 --> 00:33:41.742]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:41.742 --> 00:33:45.824]  The websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:53.812 --> 00:34:03.439]  When you're up on InfoWars.com, you will see the book that we're carrying, The Revolution Manifesto, number one on the New York Times bestseller list and holding there.
[00:34:03.439 --> 00:34:07.642]  Sold out across most of the nation, with the third printing about to come out.
[00:34:07.642 --> 00:34:12.906]  And we are extremely honored to have Congressman Ron Paul on with us for the next 25 minutes.
[00:34:12.906 --> 00:34:19.071]  Congressman, congratulations on waking up tens of millions of people for the message of liberty with your ongoing campaign.
[00:34:19.071 --> 00:34:22.033]  Congratulations on having the New York Times number one bestseller.
[00:34:22.782 --> 00:34:28.688]  Thank you very much, and I appreciate all your help for getting so many people interested in this subject.
[00:34:28.688 --> 00:34:34.915]  Well, we're all in this together, and my liberty depends on your liberty and all of us together, so I thank you, sir.
[00:34:34.915 --> 00:34:36.416]  It's all symbiotic.
[00:34:36.416 --> 00:34:37.758]  Out of the gate, before we get into the book,
[00:34:38.733 --> 00:34:49.402]  We are having a lot of debates, discussions within the revolution that you're the focal point of about what's really happening, why we're getting the delegates, what's going to happen at the convention.
[00:34:49.402 --> 00:34:55.708]  What would you like to see happen at the convention and what do you think is realistic and what do you think is constitutional?
[00:34:56.812 --> 00:35:07.440]  Well, the most realistic thing that could happen is for us to have a presence there, a very positive presence, an enthusiastic presence, and a lot of people.
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:09.181]  Which means we have delegates.
[00:35:09.181 --> 00:35:12.904]  There aren't that many, there's going to be several dozen, that's about all.
[00:35:12.904 --> 00:35:16.206]  There's going to be a lot of alternates, but there's going to be a lot of people around.
[00:35:16.206 --> 00:35:18.608]  Of course, we're going to have a rally up there as well.
[00:35:19.408 --> 00:35:31.896]  Uh, you know, at the university, so we, I would say maybe the biggest thing that will come of the whole thing would be a grand rally, uh, which will get some attention because otherwise the whole convention is going to be pretty boring.
[00:35:31.896 --> 00:35:35.958]  I think to be realistic, uh, you know, we can't challenge the system.
[00:35:35.958 --> 00:35:43.722]  You know, even if we come close to controlling a delegation, they bend the rules or break the rules or ignore the rules and they run roughshod over you.
[00:35:43.722 --> 00:35:48.045]  But that doesn't mean that that should diminish our enthusiasm because what really counts
[00:35:48.946 --> 00:35:53.812]  Our ideas are more powerful than all the shenanigans that they pull.
[00:35:53.812 --> 00:35:58.598]  So I don't expect us to have any official presence at the convention.
[00:35:58.598 --> 00:36:02.022]  They're not going to give me a speaking engagement, I'm quite certain.
[00:36:02.022 --> 00:36:06.888]  And they're not going to allow a nomination or something like that, because they're not going to allow us to qualify.
[00:36:07.566 --> 00:36:13.448]  But that shouldn't discourage us in any way, because I think our momentum is actually building.
[00:36:13.448 --> 00:36:26.012]  You know, the number of people who are looking for information on Facebook and other places are actually climbing right now, not declining, even though people say, well, the campaign is essentially over.
[00:36:26.012 --> 00:36:30.053]  Well, the long-term campaign is really, really just getting started.
[00:36:30.053 --> 00:36:31.714]  We just had a tremendous boost.
[00:36:31.714 --> 00:36:32.994]  So I think we have to be realistic.
[00:36:34.018 --> 00:36:38.742]  We're not going to be able to beat them under their own rules because they don't follow them.
[00:36:38.742 --> 00:36:47.949]  At the same time, since our ideas are so powerful and those ideas, the time has come for them, they can't really quiet us at all.
[00:36:47.949 --> 00:36:57.556]  The only thing I'm asking for is that everybody do it in a dignified manner and not to be looking for confrontation.
[00:36:57.556 --> 00:37:01.259]  Our ideas are powerful enough that we don't have to resort to any wild tactics.
[00:37:03.052 --> 00:37:23.906]  Shifting gears along that same line, though, Jim Tucker, a few weeks ago, was able to get some of the minutes out of the Trilateral Commission annual meeting, and Jim has always given us good intel from Bilderberg, good intel from trilateral meetings, from his sources, and so I found him to be an accurate source.
[00:37:23.906 --> 00:37:27.869]  He's predicted a lot of things before they happen from these sources, and he said that
[00:37:28.701 --> 00:37:44.586]  In the main Trilateral Commission meeting, you were specifically brought up, and they said, not your, you know, the campaign, they said, yeah, they're not in danger of you becoming president now, but that the idea has gotten flashpoint and the tens of millions have woken up
[00:37:45.266 --> 00:38:08.634]  And that they wanted to do basically media hit pieces on you or try to pressure you through the House leadership in the coming months to shut you up and to stop you going out to universities and energizing young people and they bemoaned that the false left-right paradigm was shattering and that young people instead of being young socialists like the 60s are becoming freedom lovers and that they were very concerned.
[00:38:09.955 --> 00:38:23.495]  Yeah, you know, there's probably something to this, but isn't it interesting, the Republicans are annoyed, but in a way the Republicans should welcome me, because I could neutralize some of the young people's support for Obama.
[00:38:24.082 --> 00:38:37.234]  But I think what you're telling me explains that it isn't the Republicans that run the show or the Democrats, but it's the powerful special interests, the elites, who control both parties.
[00:38:37.234 --> 00:38:39.416]  You know, the trilateral people and others.
[00:38:39.416 --> 00:38:41.598]  They're the ones who are frightened from our ideas.
[00:38:42.319 --> 00:38:52.266]  They would be very intimidated by, say, a gold standard or a non-interventionist foreign policy where we're not policing the world and we challenge the military-industrial complex.
[00:38:52.266 --> 00:38:57.609]  If it were strictly a political ploy, I would think that we could serve the Republican interest.
[00:38:57.609 --> 00:39:00.131]  They should welcome us, a couple million people coming in.
[00:39:00.131 --> 00:39:00.891]  Why offend us?
[00:39:04.209 --> 00:39:12.133]  We would neutralize some of this enthusiasm for Obama, but I think the controlling answers are the ones who are the most important in this story.
[00:39:12.133 --> 00:39:12.813]  Well, you're right.
[00:39:12.813 --> 00:39:17.555]  It doesn't matter if 91% of Americans want to control our sovereignty and our border in a Gallup poll.
[00:39:17.555 --> 00:39:19.036]  Both parties are against it.
[00:39:19.036 --> 00:39:22.817]  It doesn't matter if 70-80% want to end the war in both parties.
[00:39:22.817 --> 00:39:24.618]  The establishment, both parties are for it.
[00:39:25.318 --> 00:39:27.459]  We see this collision happening.
[00:39:27.459 --> 00:39:36.544]  How do you see that unfolding as your predictions about the economy come true, as the chickens come home to roost, as the dollar implodes, as our name implodes?
[00:39:36.544 --> 00:39:44.388]  It seems the establishment gets more authoritarian and more arrogant as everyone turns against them.
[00:39:44.828 --> 00:39:57.958]  Yeah, it's more dangerous than ever because, you know, up until now, for the last hundred years, they've controlled everything through economic power and the Federal Reserve and the banks and the budgetary process.
[00:39:57.958 --> 00:40:05.684]  But when that fails, when the budgetary process fails and the dollar fails and even their own system is challenged,
[00:40:06.624 --> 00:40:14.790]  They don't have the financial community that can hold us together, because the markets are actually more powerful than anything else.
[00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:20.533]  They couldn't fix the price of gold.
[00:40:20.533 --> 00:40:23.055]  The price of gold eventually breaks down.
[00:40:23.055 --> 00:40:27.578]  But the danger is, instead of resorting just to manipulating the economy behind the scenes,
[00:40:28.118 --> 00:40:29.359]  All of a sudden, the whole thing's together.
[00:40:29.359 --> 00:40:32.220]  They have to become more authoritarian and look at what's happened.
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:47.946]  You know, it's more authoritarian from top to bottom, whether it has to do with overseas activity, whether it has to do with spying on American citizens and doing all the harassment here at home and national ID cards and more control of the economy.
[00:40:47.946 --> 00:40:50.547]  So this is the contest going on.
[00:40:51.727 --> 00:40:57.248]  Are the American people going to put up with it and say, you know, whatever they want to do, let them do?
[00:40:57.248 --> 00:41:02.329]  But this is, to me, a tremendous opportunity, because up until now, the American people have been complacent.
[00:41:02.329 --> 00:41:04.210]  They say, oh, the government's going to help me.
[00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:06.490]  I'm doing fine, and I'll do my best.
[00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:08.911]  But if I need help, the government's going to take care of me.
[00:41:08.911 --> 00:41:11.631]  And they've been complacent, and they accept the help.
[00:41:11.631 --> 00:41:18.213]  But now the government's running out of its ability to help, and all they can offer is more force and authoritarianism.
[00:41:18.213 --> 00:41:19.953]  So the conflict, I'm sure, will build.
[00:41:21.608 --> 00:41:26.171]  And timeframe-wise, you've been pretty accurate in the past on when you thought things would break down.
[00:41:26.171 --> 00:41:29.172]  I remember in 2003, the war had just started.
[00:41:29.172 --> 00:41:36.396]  You were speaking in Bastrop, outside Austin, and I asked you, I said, when do you think things will start, really start unraveling?
[00:41:36.396 --> 00:41:40.199]  You said, well, it could happen any time, but probably five, six, seven years from now.
[00:41:40.199 --> 00:41:46.182]  You know, these things can build a long time, and here we are five, six years later.
[00:41:46.182 --> 00:41:48.003]  How long can this bubble just continue on?
[00:41:48.423 --> 00:41:50.685]  Well, I think it's starting to unravel.
[00:41:50.685 --> 00:41:56.511]  I mean, when you look at last year's value of the dollar, that's certainly been a major attack.
[00:41:56.511 --> 00:42:04.239]  I think the most significant event going on right now is the prices going up, the price inflation.
[00:42:04.239 --> 00:42:06.241]  People are now getting scared.
[00:42:06.241 --> 00:42:08.523]  They want pay raises and they want help.
[00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:17.678]  And the psychology has changed, and yet the government just tries to deceive everybody by continuing their lies.
[00:42:17.678 --> 00:42:24.964]  They keep telling us, you know, this last report on the CPI, they tried to say it was like a 2% or something like that.
[00:42:27.242 --> 00:42:33.747]  And they said, you know, that actually the energy prices went down because they averaged them out for the year.
[00:42:33.747 --> 00:42:36.910]  Nobody believes that nonsense anymore.
[00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:44.836]  So they're being hit and they're hurting, but that's the reason they're not going to be content with some of the cliches from the government.
[00:42:44.836 --> 00:42:50.060]  And that's why they're looking toward us to try to figure out the problem and what the answers are going to be.
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:51.141]  Well, exactly.
[00:42:51.141 --> 00:43:05.136]  Just, what, six, seven months ago, in the winter of 2007, you had Bernanke in front of you, the new Fed chief, and he said that, oh, we have 2.4 percent inflation, and
[00:43:05.899 --> 00:43:09.102]  And then you said, well, even mainstream news says it's more like 7 or 10.
[00:43:09.102 --> 00:43:10.983]  I'm going from memory on this.
[00:43:10.983 --> 00:43:13.905]  And then basically you just laughed at him and so did the media.
[00:43:13.905 --> 00:43:19.890]  I mean, how are they going to continue when most of the private groups that analyze it say 13 to 15 percent?
[00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:22.872]  Mainstream news is saying 10, 12 percent.
[00:43:22.872 --> 00:43:29.197]  I mean, how are they going to deny that inflation is going on and that oil prices are up because the dollar has gone in the toilet?
[00:43:29.657 --> 00:43:35.682]  I mean, just a month ago, they asked the White House Press Secretary, they said, is it true that oil's up because the dollar's down?
[00:43:35.682 --> 00:43:38.184]  And she said, I can't answer that question, I'd be fired.
[00:43:38.184 --> 00:43:45.189]  Like, we have to, like, three-year-old children go to the White House and say, is it true the dollar's been devalued?
[00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:46.910]  Can you speak to that, Congressman?
[00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:53.415]  Well, you know, the more they do that, the more they lose credibility, and that helps us, because nobody's gonna believe them.
[00:43:53.915 --> 00:44:00.117]  But that is the whole point, and that's why I drill at home all the time, is you've got to think about the value of the dollar.
[00:44:00.117 --> 00:44:07.440]  And then that brings in the whole context of the idea of spending too much money and overtaxing, overborrowing, and printing the money.
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.161]  And more people are starting to think about that now.
[00:44:10.161 --> 00:44:18.084]  You know, when I first started, I was reluctant because I didn't think anybody would care about the Federal Reserve System, and that left me right off the stage.
[00:44:19.385 --> 00:44:26.071]  This now gets the loudest applause on university campuses when I bring up the idea of money and monetary policy.
[00:44:26.071 --> 00:44:32.798]  And even Amazon has responded by selling some of Murray Rothbard's book and advertising them about the money.
[00:44:32.798 --> 00:44:34.900]  So I think we've made great strides.
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:35.620]  Exactly!
[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:38.163]  That's why the Trilateral Commission is afraid.
[00:44:38.163 --> 00:44:40.385]  Last week I had the head of the Kissinger Group on the show.
[00:44:41.005 --> 00:44:43.926]  And I was talking to him before I went on air, and he goes, we know who you are, Alex.
[00:44:43.926 --> 00:44:45.206]  Yes, we're aware of your work.
[00:44:45.206 --> 00:44:52.469]  If they're aware of me, and you're much bigger than I am, I mean, we've got the head of the Kissinger Group agreeing to come on my show to try to counter us.
[00:44:52.469 --> 00:44:54.189]  That means they really are upset.
[00:44:54.189 --> 00:45:03.452]  I mean, if they're talking about you as the number one topic, and saying, yeah, they're waking up about the monetary system, that was the other point they made, that shows we're really hurting them.
[00:45:04.262 --> 00:45:18.768]  And the thing that we have to look for is if they start cracking down even more so, if they start wanting to tax and control and regulate the internet and going after radio talk show hosts, I mean that's when we'll be in big trouble.
[00:45:18.768 --> 00:45:27.831]  Because fortunately, you know, we complain a lot about how bad things are going, but I still brag that we do live in a good country and it's worth saving and we've had great traditions.
[00:45:28.531 --> 00:45:34.837]  And I've been pretty fortunate to run on what I believe in and vote that way and still get re-elected.
[00:45:34.837 --> 00:45:41.943]  So, as bad as things are, we don't live in a totalitarian state, although that's what we fear.
[00:45:41.943 --> 00:45:48.409]  And that's why we have to be alert and vigilant, because if they move quickly to get rid of our ability to communicate,
[00:45:49.269 --> 00:45:50.710]  Then we're in big trouble.
[00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:54.853]  Well, that's what I wanted to say, is that it was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
[00:45:54.853 --> 00:46:07.842]  Our lives are great, our families are great, it's still the best country in the world, but in the sectors and the corridors of power, it's never been more corrupt, more infested with the White House writing memos about torturing children and saying it's okay.
[00:46:07.842 --> 00:46:11.865]  And that's my point, is they're definitely making a move and trying.
[00:46:11.865 --> 00:46:14.607]  I think they are getting pushed back at some levels.
[00:46:14.607 --> 00:46:16.408]  Is that an accurate statement?
[00:46:16.588 --> 00:46:17.809]  Oh, I think so.
[00:46:17.809 --> 00:46:23.872]  It's because the number of people who have become disenchanted are growing because the standard of living is going down.
[00:46:23.872 --> 00:46:25.672]  That's back to the monetary policy.
[00:46:25.672 --> 00:46:29.614]  People are still making nominal dollars, but the dollars aren't going as far.
[00:46:29.614 --> 00:46:37.858]  The people on retirement or Social Security, they're getting benefits, but all of a sudden they're much poorer because they're losing 10% of their purchasing power every year.
[00:46:37.858 --> 00:46:41.600]  So every year they get poorer, and that's why people are very stirred up.
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:47:03.108]  You know, even though at every rally I talk about just getting young people out of Social Security and doing our best to take care of those people who are dependent, you never get boos from elderly people who are worried about getting their checks, because they know if we, our side, straightens up the mess, they're more likely to get something from Social Security, where they know what's happening now.
[00:47:03.108 --> 00:47:06.189]  If we continue this, that everybody is going to suffer.
[00:47:06.189 --> 00:47:11.011]  The people who are receiving checks from the government, as well as those who are expected to continue to work.
[00:47:11.491 --> 00:47:13.852]  Now I want to shift gears into another topic.
[00:47:13.852 --> 00:47:16.494]  This just came out in the mainstream news last Thursday.
[00:47:16.494 --> 00:47:18.695]  I know you're quite a news hound yourself.
[00:47:18.695 --> 00:47:19.775]  You may not have heard it.
[00:47:19.775 --> 00:47:33.222]  Did you hear about the Rumsfeld tape with all these fake military advisors on Pentagon payroll they have on the news bringing up, boy we sure need another terror attack to get our agenda through without another attack.
[00:47:33.222 --> 00:47:35.303]  We're not going to be able to get our agenda through.
[00:47:35.303 --> 00:47:36.924]  A. Are you aware of that?
[00:47:36.924 --> 00:47:38.745]  And B. What do you think of that statement?
[00:47:39.045 --> 00:47:41.045]  Well, just vaguely.
[00:47:41.045 --> 00:47:47.627]  I don't know the details, so I really can't make a very good statement on that, but anything's possible with these guys.
[00:47:47.627 --> 00:47:48.347]  Let me just play it.
[00:47:48.347 --> 00:47:50.328]  It's about a minute long.
[00:47:50.328 --> 00:47:57.469]  This is Rumsfeld, 2006, Washington Post, Associated Press, PrisonPlanet.com, and you can go listen to hours of it.
[00:47:57.469 --> 00:48:03.771]  This is with the military consultants, experts they have on all the major news channels.
[00:48:03.771 --> 00:48:05.051]  He's in a room full of them.
[00:48:05.051 --> 00:48:05.411]  Here it is.
[00:48:06.131 --> 00:48:08.413]  This president is pretty much a victim of success.
[00:48:08.413 --> 00:48:13.276]  We haven't had an attack here in five years.
[00:48:13.276 --> 00:48:13.776]  Help.
[00:48:13.776 --> 00:48:26.524]  The perception of threat is so low in society today that it's not surprising that the behavior pattern reflects a low threat assessment.
[00:48:26.524 --> 00:48:30.707]  And the same thing is in Europe, where there's a low threat perception.
[00:48:32.666 --> 00:48:35.808]  Okay, Congressman, we're able to hear that.
[00:48:35.808 --> 00:48:38.769]  They say to him, don't we need another attack?
[00:48:38.769 --> 00:48:41.090]  And then his answer is yes.
[00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:42.851]  I guess the cure for this is another attack.
[00:49:01.832 --> 00:49:05.174]  Yeah, and I think that's the way they do think.
[00:49:05.174 --> 00:49:16.221]  I've never gotten to the point where they absolutely plan every event, but boy, when there is an opportunity, do they jump at it.
[00:49:16.221 --> 00:49:21.004]  They had planned for a long time on the Patriot Act, but they had to wait for the right time.
[00:49:21.004 --> 00:49:26.207]  They had planned for a long time to invade Iraq as early as 2008, the plans were late.
[00:49:28.968 --> 00:49:32.449]  I mean, you know, 1998, you know, the plans were late.
[00:49:32.449 --> 00:49:38.331]  But they wait for opportunity, they help create them, they manipulate them, they do whatever is necessary.
[00:49:38.331 --> 00:49:40.552]  We have a clip of Gary Hart.
[00:49:40.552 --> 00:49:41.512]  Sorry, Congressman, go ahead.
[00:49:41.512 --> 00:49:43.213]  They do know public opinion is important.
[00:49:43.213 --> 00:49:46.094]  They've got to get the consensus of the people to rally behind them.
[00:49:46.094 --> 00:49:55.997]  Have you seen the Gary Hart clip where he not only wrote a letter to Iran, we now interviewed him, and he said, yes, I'm worried the government will stage another Gulf of Tonkin or USS Maine event to attack Iran.
[00:49:56.869 --> 00:50:05.775]  Of course, I've been worrying about that all along, and once again, I always take the position, I always hope that they don't do it on their own.
[00:50:05.775 --> 00:50:09.597]  I hate thinking they're capable, yet they are.
[00:50:09.597 --> 00:50:23.386]  But no matter what, whether it's an accident, or they deliberately do it, or one individual does it, or they hire somebody to do it, an event has to happen to really get the people behind it and be complacent enough to send more kids off to get killed.
[00:50:24.491 --> 00:50:25.892]  Final segment with the congressman.
[00:50:25.892 --> 00:50:27.292]  We'll have five minutes on the other side.
[00:50:27.292 --> 00:50:28.773]  I'll have two questions for him.
[00:50:28.773 --> 00:50:30.453]  What does he think of the field of candidates?
[00:50:30.453 --> 00:50:34.035]  I mean, dumb, dumber, and dumbest.
[00:50:34.035 --> 00:50:34.875]  That's my opinion.
[00:50:34.875 --> 00:50:37.396]  I mean, big government, either way, you roll the dice.
[00:50:37.396 --> 00:50:38.616]  It's a rigged game.
[00:50:38.616 --> 00:50:39.897]  They own all the horses.
[00:50:39.897 --> 00:50:46.079]  And we'll talk about his book, The Revolution, A Manifesto, number one on the New York Times bestselling list.
[00:50:46.079 --> 00:50:48.540]  He's going to be at Book People.
[00:50:49.722 --> 00:50:53.864]  One of the book facilities here in Austin, Texas today will tell you where that's going to be as well.
[00:50:53.864 --> 00:50:55.825]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:50:55.825 --> 00:50:59.447]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:50:59.447 --> 00:51:01.908]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:51:01.908 --> 00:51:04.950]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:10.673]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:51:10.673 --> 00:51:14.595]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:51:14.915 --> 00:51:20.120]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:23.162]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[00:51:51.982 --> 00:51:52.743]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:51:54.397 --> 00:51:58.200]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:02.343]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[00:52:02.343 --> 00:52:09.148]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually, with a worse toll taken by antibiotics.
[00:52:09.148 --> 00:52:12.050]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:21.836]  OxySilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[00:52:21.836 --> 00:52:26.500]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:29.602]  OxySilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[00:52:29.602 --> 00:52:36.066]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers, and more.
[00:52:36.066 --> 00:52:42.070]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely, and inexpensively with OxySilver.
[00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:47.732]  Order your supply now by calling toll-free 1-877-817-9829.
[00:52:47.732 --> 00:52:52.433]  That's 1-877-817-9829.
[00:52:52.433 --> 00:52:54.074]  Do it now.
[00:52:54.074 --> 00:52:55.354]  Why should we fire Congress?
[00:52:55.354 --> 00:52:58.996]  Because they use the Constitution of the United States as a scrap of paper.
[00:52:58.996 --> 00:53:01.296]  They swear an oath to follow it, and then they reject it.
[00:53:01.296 --> 00:53:04.097]  That was their employment document.
[00:53:04.097 --> 00:53:05.158]  They haven't followed it.
[00:53:05.158 --> 00:53:07.058]  Congressmen, Senators, you're fired.
[00:53:07.058 --> 00:53:08.759]  Washington, you're fired!
[00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:10.480]  I think it's the next freedom to fascism.
[00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:33.901]  How they affect you and what you can do about it.
[00:53:33.901 --> 00:53:38.283]  Washington You're Fired captures the spirit and zest of an old-fashioned Boston tea party.
[00:53:38.283 --> 00:53:42.144]  Kem Williams describes the film as a rabble-rousing call to arms.
[00:53:42.144 --> 00:53:44.025]  We invite you to make the change with us.
[00:53:44.025 --> 00:53:45.586]  Help take back our government now.
[00:53:45.586 --> 00:53:49.867]  Go to TakeBackWashington.com and get the video tools you need for the information war.
[00:53:49.867 --> 00:53:51.688]  We have a plan to take back our government.
[00:53:51.688 --> 00:53:53.289]  Please visit TakeBackWashington.com.
[00:54:05.032 --> 00:54:08.673]  Okay, final segment with Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:54:08.673 --> 00:54:10.854]  He's run an amazing campaign.
[00:54:10.854 --> 00:54:13.394]  The Trilateral Commission is very upset.
[00:54:13.394 --> 00:54:15.635]  We have that from a great source.
[00:54:15.635 --> 00:54:24.977]  And I've talked to top globalists myself who are very upset about what I'm doing, and I'm small fish compared to Congressman Ron Paul, who now really is our champion.
[00:54:24.977 --> 00:54:28.338]  Champion of the Constitution, and we've got to commend him.
[00:54:28.338 --> 00:54:30.679]  Just real fast, before we get into the Obama thing in your book,
[00:54:31.332 --> 00:54:38.682]  To be clear, because I've said I support taking over the delegates to control the party charters and the platform and to take over the party machinery.
[00:54:39.483 --> 00:54:55.930]  But I kept getting from your letters and your statements that, you know, if somebody is a delegate pledged for McCain, or if somebody is a delegate for that vote, you've got to go with that, because the media would crucify us, A, like we were trying to steal an election, and B, you had said that you wanted to honor the delegate process.
[00:54:55.930 --> 00:54:58.171]  People said, no, no, no, Ron Paul hadn't said that.
[00:54:58.171 --> 00:55:04.554]  There's a large camp in the delegate process that do intend some type of takeover, which, of course, will be
[00:55:06.756 --> 00:55:19.006]  Yeah, I mean, that's not going to happen, but that doesn't mean that people who are delegates and alternates shouldn't go, or at the grassroots, they should continue to do what they're doing.
[00:55:19.006 --> 00:55:21.208]  We're still going to have our Texas convention.
[00:55:21.208 --> 00:55:31.997]  We're going to have a presence there, and they're going to be involved, and they're going to try to, you know, influence the platform and do all the things that they should, because, you know, there is a future.
[00:55:33.546 --> 00:55:42.508]  If they don't have the numbers now, they're going to get them later, but they should be running for precinct leader, or whatever they want to do to continue this activity.
[00:55:42.508 --> 00:56:00.813]  But to think that we're going to go over in some sneaky way, take over the National Convention, or totally control the Texas Convention, I mean, we have to be realistic, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't do what we're doing, and we could very well have a great deal of influence, but ultimately, the real influence
[00:56:01.712 --> 00:56:05.297]  Our numbers and the strength of our message and winning the hearts of millions of people.
[00:56:05.297 --> 00:56:05.958]  And spreading.
[00:56:05.958 --> 00:56:11.687]  Every Ron Paul supporter, every lover of liberty has to wake up two or three people in the next month and have them wake up other folks.
[00:56:11.687 --> 00:56:14.672]  Barack Obama, McCain, Hillary, give me your take on that, Congressman.
[00:56:15.166 --> 00:56:18.387]  Well, there's really no choice there at all.
[00:56:18.387 --> 00:56:20.048]  They all belong to the same group.
[00:56:20.048 --> 00:56:29.311]  They all belong to the, you know, they're beholden to the military-industrial complex and the medical industry, the media industry.
[00:56:29.311 --> 00:56:32.692]  I mean, the whole work, the banking industry, nothing is different.
[00:56:32.692 --> 00:56:34.873]  The rhetoric is different and they appeal different ways.
[00:56:34.873 --> 00:56:36.774]  They're all after power.
[00:56:36.774 --> 00:56:38.635]  But there's not going to be a whole lot of difference.
[00:56:38.635 --> 00:56:42.516]  Now, if I had, if I didn't know anybody's name, I'd just listen to what they said.
[00:56:43.288 --> 00:56:49.112]  I would say on foreign policy, Obama probably sounds more reasonable.
[00:56:49.112 --> 00:57:00.461]  But, you know, I know who he is, I know what he believes in, and I don't believe that if we have an Obama presidency, all of a sudden we're going to have a more sensible foreign policy.
[00:57:00.461 --> 00:57:03.603]  The same forces will have their control.
[00:57:03.603 --> 00:57:06.045]  So I think that's not where the argument should be.
[00:57:06.045 --> 00:57:10.588]  The argument has to be, do we want to continue the politics of those three individuals?
[00:57:11.013 --> 00:57:12.414]  Or do we want to change the country?
[00:57:12.414 --> 00:57:14.535]  Do we want to restore the Constitution?
[00:57:14.535 --> 00:57:16.156]  Do we want sound money?
[00:57:16.156 --> 00:57:18.257]  Do we want to challenge the whole system?
[00:57:18.257 --> 00:57:21.079]  And that, of course, is what the revolution is all about.
[00:57:21.079 --> 00:57:25.542]  So you would say that Obama is a false or fake revolution.
[00:57:25.542 --> 00:57:29.724]  He's talking about change, but change with socialized healthcare and more government.
[00:57:30.248 --> 00:57:38.196]  Yeah, he is, and it's interesting that he does appeal to some of the very same people we appeal to, because he wants to have change.
[00:57:38.196 --> 00:57:39.798]  But has he been very specific?
[00:57:39.798 --> 00:57:47.847]  Does he talk about non-intervention foreign policy, or sound money, or attacking the military-industrial complex, bringing the troops home, balancing the budget?
[00:57:47.847 --> 00:57:48.988]  No, none of that.
[00:57:48.988 --> 00:57:51.851]  But still, superficially, when people hear him,
[00:57:52.521 --> 00:57:58.904]  They'll say, oh yeah, he's different, he's going to have changes, and he has something like Ron Paul, and he has a chance.
[00:57:58.904 --> 00:58:00.024]  I'm going with Obama.
[00:58:00.024 --> 00:58:05.926]  Congressman, the new book is The Revolution Manifesto, best seller available at InfoWars.com right now.
[00:58:05.926 --> 00:58:09.988]  In closing, who do you think McCain's running mate will be, and who do you think the ticket's going to be on the Democratic side?
[00:58:10.942 --> 00:58:20.928]  Well, my guess is no better than anybody else's, but maybe he'll end up picking Huckabee to try to, you know, solidify the Christian right, those supporters of the war, you know.
[00:58:20.928 --> 00:58:21.588]  And then Obama-Hillary?
[00:58:21.588 --> 00:58:22.508]  Right, you belong to war.
[00:58:22.508 --> 00:58:25.390]  And then Obama-Hillary on the other side?
[00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:30.893]  Obama, I still think that they all would be inclined maybe to put Hillary on the ticket, or Edward, I don't know.
[00:58:30.893 --> 00:58:32.294]  Congressman, thank you so much.
[00:58:36.055 --> 00:58:38.558]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:38.558 --> 00:58:44.305]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:44.305 --> 00:58:45.646]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:46.781 --> 00:58:48.523]  A New World Order.
[00:58:48.523 --> 00:58:53.068]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:58:53.068 --> 00:58:56.271]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:56.271 --> 00:58:59.054]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:58:59.054 --> 00:59:02.237]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:02.237 --> 00:59:09.564]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:12.591 --> 00:59:18.015]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:59:18.015 --> 00:59:21.397]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:59:46.373 --> 00:59:48.754]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:48.754 --> 00:59:58.199]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:58.199 --> 00:59:59.960]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.541]  You want answers?
[01:00:01.541 --> 01:00:02.501]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:02.501 --> 01:00:07.284]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.284 --> 01:00:11.346]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.669 --> 01:00:16.310]  Well, that was an amazing interview with Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:29.156]  He'll be at Book People this evening, 7 o'clock, downtown Austin, off of South Lamar, by the Gigantorb, world headquarters of Whole Foods.
[01:00:29.156 --> 01:00:29.857]  I wish I could go to that.
[01:00:29.857 --> 01:00:43.123]  I'll be doing a live TV show tonight, and I wish I was invited to a private meeting with Ron Paul and local Austin supporters, but I will not be going to that, but he did invite some of my staff along, so I'm going to be sending Aaron over there to do an interview with him at the end of it.
[01:00:44.164 --> 01:00:48.025]  Before I go any further, I am trying to capitalize my operation so I can hire more people.
[01:01:13.428 --> 01:01:21.735]  And before I do that, because I'm in a 2,300 square foot converted repair shop, I'm literally in a three-room shack.
[01:01:21.735 --> 01:01:23.156]  People, it's from the Old West.
[01:01:23.156 --> 01:01:25.398]  You drive by it, it looks like an Old West set.
[01:01:25.398 --> 01:01:25.819]  It's not.
[01:01:25.819 --> 01:01:27.940]  It was built in the 1920s.
[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:31.824]  And let me tell you, people literally think they're going to see Matt Dillon out front where I'm at.
[01:01:31.824 --> 01:01:34.486]  It's a nice place, but we've grown out of it.
[01:01:34.486 --> 01:01:38.849]  But we're going to need a lot of money to do this, because I'm not going to just go into something a little bit bigger.
[01:01:38.849 --> 01:01:41.592]  I'm going to move into something a lot bigger so I can do what I need to do.
[01:01:42.581 --> 01:01:52.568]  And I'm going to start a TV show that's going to be on the web, that's high quality, then we're going to beta test it quickly, moving on to probably five nights a week on Dish Network or something along those lines.
[01:01:52.568 --> 01:02:00.594]  We're looking at that because we have the buzz, we have the listeners to create something new, kind of like Democracy Now!, but it's going to take a lot of capital to do that.
[01:02:01.628 --> 01:02:06.791]  And, uh, you know I don't just shoot my mouth off or talk about pie in the sky or sell blue sky here.
[01:02:06.791 --> 01:02:08.432]  I always do what I say I'm gonna do.
[01:02:08.432 --> 01:02:12.994]  That's why it's a huge commitment for me, but I need the financial backup here.
[01:02:12.994 --> 01:02:14.615]  All I think about is fighting the New World Order.
[01:02:14.615 --> 01:02:16.256]  All I think about is how to bring them down.
[01:02:16.256 --> 01:02:18.918]  All I think about is waking up my fellow Americans.
[01:02:18.918 --> 01:02:21.239]  All I think about is waking up the world.
[01:02:21.239 --> 01:02:26.862]  And I can frankly think of no one out there who deserves the financial support more than my operation and my great crew.
[01:02:28.214 --> 01:02:32.336]  And I can think of nowhere where there's a bigger punch for your dollar, bigger bang for your buck.
[01:02:32.336 --> 01:02:53.284]  So buy the DVDs, buy Loose Change Final Cut, buy Endgame, buy Police State 3 The Takeover, buy Terror Storm, buy American Drug War, Washington You're Fired, all the DVDs, the books, the materials that we sell on InfoWars.com, the secure online video and bookstore shopping cart, InfoWars.com.
[01:02:53.284 --> 01:02:54.725]  That's how we pay for it.
[01:02:54.725 --> 01:02:55.605]  That's how we do it.
[01:02:56.369 --> 01:03:01.334]  And plus they're the best films that we carry, that others have made, and then my 18 films.
[01:03:01.334 --> 01:03:04.117]  This is how we get the word out.
[01:03:04.117 --> 01:03:07.540]  PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:09.962]  So we can put out really high quality video.
[01:03:09.962 --> 01:03:11.484]  If you've got a membership, thank you.
[01:03:11.484 --> 01:03:15.127]  If you don't have a membership, go get a 15 cent a day membership, $5.95 a month.
[01:03:15.127 --> 01:03:16.509]  Sign up for a year and get three months free.
[01:03:18.459 --> 01:03:20.541]  And I know things are tough financially.
[01:03:20.541 --> 01:03:25.486]  Our audience has doubled in the last year, and our revenues stayed the same.
[01:03:25.486 --> 01:03:27.768]  That tells you how bad the economy is.
[01:03:27.768 --> 01:03:31.211]  Our measurable audience has doubled in the last year, and our income has stayed the same.
[01:03:32.006 --> 01:03:37.631]  And, uh, I'd like to be able to give my employees a little bit of a raise, because the dollar is being devalued now domestically, first it happened internationally.
[01:03:37.631 --> 01:03:39.792]  And I know you'd like one too, I understand that.
[01:03:39.792 --> 01:03:45.117]  But I'm saying, support us if you want us to not just be here, but expand and go to the next level.
[01:03:45.117 --> 01:03:50.181]  Which, I'm not putting my whole life into this, I'm not putting it all on the line for nothing.
[01:03:50.181 --> 01:03:53.884]  So, InfoWars.com, to go to the Secure Online Shopping Cart, or call 888-253-3139, 888,

[01:04:08.833 --> 01:04:11.998]  I didn't start plugging this until really last Thursday or Friday.
[01:04:11.998 --> 01:04:14.882]  We got a lot of pledges on there and we could do so much.
[01:04:15.669 --> 01:04:31.224]  I mean, we're as good a place to give money as Ron Paul, and in the long run, you know, it's probably even better if you want to get down to brass tacks and just be honest about it, because I will take 100% of that money, and I will shoot it straight into the heart of the New World Order.
[01:04:31.224 --> 01:04:35.228]  I will fire black arrows right into the New World Order in the info war.
[01:04:35.228 --> 01:04:37.951]  I will expand what we're doing, and you know
[01:04:39.233 --> 01:04:43.818]  As an attack frigate, we have absolutely wreaked havoc on the enemy.
[01:04:43.818 --> 01:04:49.965]  I want to go up to giant floating fortress level so we can really bombard their main capital cities in the Info War.
[01:04:51.127 --> 01:04:53.989]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:04:53.989 --> 01:04:55.551]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:04:55.551 --> 01:04:57.692]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:04:57.692 --> 01:04:59.594]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:04:59.594 --> 01:05:01.095]  The late great USA.
[01:05:01.095 --> 01:05:02.856]  America, freedom to fascism.

[01:05:50.782 --> 01:05:59.705]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:05:59.705 --> 01:06:04.867]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.

[01:06:53.368 --> 01:06:58.889]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:06:58.889 --> 01:07:04.611]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:07:04.611 --> 01:07:06.091]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:06.091 --> 01:07:14.974]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[01:07:37.563 --> 01:07:41.486]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:41.486 --> 01:07:42.947]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.032 --> 01:08:18.854]  Well, Henry McHale's a PhD, was born in Zurich, Switzerland.
[01:08:18.854 --> 01:08:21.255]  He's a Canadian, uh, quote, conspiracy theorist.
[01:08:21.255 --> 01:08:22.255]  This is Wikipedia.
[01:08:22.255 --> 01:08:36.182]  That means he reads Carnegie Endowment and Rockefeller Endowment documents where they said they'd break up the family and, and, you know, best-selling books written by, uh, the father of modern advertising and propaganda, Edward Bernays, about how they engineered the feminist movement.
[01:08:36.182 --> 01:08:37.382]  Doesn't matter if they all admit it.
[01:08:37.382 --> 01:08:39.123]  Wikipedia just calls him a conspiracy theorist.
[01:08:39.787 --> 01:08:41.808]  He's the inventor of the board game, Scruples.
[01:08:41.808 --> 01:08:43.329]  I guess that's a conspiracy theory, too.
[01:08:43.329 --> 01:08:44.329]  Maybe that doesn't exist, either.
[01:08:44.329 --> 01:08:48.832]  Kind of like the trans-NAFTA highway they're building right down the road from you a few miles doesn't exist.
[01:08:48.832 --> 01:08:52.214]  And the author of A Long Way to Go for a Date.
[01:08:52.214 --> 01:08:56.256]  He's also written another book called Cruel Hoax, Feminism, and the New World Order.
[01:08:57.817 --> 01:09:03.585]  And we've got a link to his website up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:09:03.585 --> 01:09:06.329]  SaveTheMales.ca.
[01:09:06.329 --> 01:09:12.116]  And he's broken a really big story the last few weeks about concentration camp extermination centers of Native Americans.
[01:09:12.978 --> 01:09:17.344]  Up in Canada, and this merges with all that I know about it, when George Bush Sr.
[01:09:17.344 --> 01:09:27.701]  ran just one of many programs before he went around the eugenics program in China, he publicly, on these facilities, got 44% of the women sterilized in just four years of running the program.
[01:09:28.873 --> 01:09:32.774]  I mean, these things are death camps, and that's what the inner cities are.
[01:09:32.774 --> 01:09:34.675]  That's what the projects have been.
[01:09:34.675 --> 01:09:35.956]  Break up the family.
[01:09:35.956 --> 01:09:38.056]  Hey, we'll give you money not to have a man in the house.
[01:09:38.056 --> 01:09:46.899]  Then within one generation, they go from 90% legitimacy to 93% illegitimacy and total unraveling of society.
[01:09:46.899 --> 01:09:49.060]  All scientifically crafted, but this particular story
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:53.002]  Because I was setting up my account last week and my producer was going, he wants you to have his other guy on.
[01:09:53.002 --> 01:09:55.483]  Then I finally looked at the story and it's like, wow!
[01:09:55.483 --> 01:10:01.085]  Meshes with all the intel I've got, but even worse, how the extermination ops are going on right now.
[01:10:01.085 --> 01:10:07.928]  Your government is completely psychopathic and criminal, waging scientific, social engineering warfare on you.
[01:10:07.928 --> 01:10:11.489]  And that goes for you too, cops and bureaucrats that serve the system.
[01:10:11.489 --> 01:10:13.270]  We're all in a red-level emergency.
[01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:14.711]  We're in a false reality.
[01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:16.331]  A false engineered reality.
[01:10:16.331 --> 01:10:17.612]  We better break out of it right now.
[01:10:18.092 --> 01:10:36.984]  And a good way to do it is with Henry McHale, who woke up to feminism, and I wanted him today to talk about, in a nutshell, how it started, why the elites did it, how they wanted both people working, so the state could have the kids, and how they've done that, and how in the name of feminism, they've turned women into absolute sexual objects, and the men are cowardly, chicken-necked fools.
[01:10:36.984 --> 01:10:39.145]  I mean, I'm not just attacking the women.
[01:10:39.145 --> 01:10:39.986]  I look at men.
[01:10:39.986 --> 01:10:41.487]  They act tough, but they're not tough.
[01:10:42.153 --> 01:10:43.374]  And they don't have moral courage.
[01:10:43.374 --> 01:10:45.175]  They're lazy.
[01:10:45.175 --> 01:10:47.757]  And they're so cowardly, they let women boss them around.
[01:10:47.757 --> 01:10:51.860]  No woman's happy when you let her boss you around.
[01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:54.382]  I mean, that's just how women are built.
[01:10:54.382 --> 01:10:56.724]  They want you to be nice to them, take care of them.
[01:10:56.724 --> 01:10:58.305]  They can have 180 IQ.
[01:10:58.305 --> 01:11:02.268]  They still want somebody to take care of them.
[01:11:02.268 --> 01:11:04.029]  And, you know, that's what it comes down to.
[01:11:04.827 --> 01:11:08.789]  I mean, they want somebody who basically is going to be their daddy.
[01:11:08.789 --> 01:11:12.111]  And, you know, boy, they get mad when you say that, but that's what they want.
[01:11:12.111 --> 01:11:14.012]  Let's go to Dr. McHale.
[01:11:14.012 --> 01:11:16.373]  Mr. McHale, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:11:16.373 --> 01:11:17.153]  My pleasure, Alex.
[01:11:17.153 --> 01:11:27.998]  The message I want to get across to your listeners, because I'm not often on your show and I don't often reach your listeners, is that there is essentially social engineering to be
[01:11:29.474 --> 01:11:31.455]  To be like homosexuals.
[01:11:31.455 --> 01:11:37.460]  They're basically trying to break up heterosexuality, undermine it, and make us like homosexuals.
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:45.766]  Now, it's really strange, but we have to wake up to the fact that we are the subjects in someone else's laboratory.
[01:11:45.766 --> 01:11:47.687]  We are being worked on.
[01:11:47.687 --> 01:11:50.049]  We've been worked on for the last 50 years.
[01:11:50.049 --> 01:11:54.012]  They use science, they use culture, they use the government.
[01:11:54.762 --> 01:12:02.507]  And they use advertising, and they're constantly giving us messages that are undermining our heterosexual nature.
[01:12:02.507 --> 01:12:05.890]  Attacking gender, that's masculinity and femininity.
[01:12:05.890 --> 01:12:11.854]  And we're not attacking other groups, and what they're into, the point is they're attacking us, the state is.
[01:12:11.854 --> 01:12:23.682]  And you watch the cartoons, the dramas, the man is an idiot, he's a moron, the women are the boss, and this is the same thing as bringing the black women in the house, where they could read, write, and run things, and then they would enslave the black men out in the pen.
[01:12:24.597 --> 01:12:35.712]  That's right, all this business about respecting homosexuals' intolerance, that's just a cover for a vicious, vicious attack on the vast majority.
[01:12:35.712 --> 01:12:41.479]  And it's being done for political reasons, to basically incapacitate us so that we'll accept
[01:12:42.443 --> 01:12:56.729]  So we'll be dysfunctional, so we can be brainwashed easier, and we can be... So we can be CPS, so they can take our children and do what they do to the natives, exterminate us, so they can break up our families, so we won't have the will to fight as tribal warriors who are meant to defend the family.
[01:12:56.729 --> 01:13:00.451]  They're destroying the nuclei of the family, which is the human species.
[01:13:00.451 --> 01:13:02.032]  Men and women, we're all connected.
[01:13:02.032 --> 01:13:04.393]  Our children, we are the species together.
[01:13:04.393 --> 01:13:05.834]  To say that we're separate is a fraud.
[01:13:05.834 --> 01:13:06.234]  Go ahead.
[01:13:06.234 --> 01:13:08.735]  Well, exactly.
[01:13:09.594 --> 01:13:15.075]  Um, when I tell people that we're being re-engineered to be homosexuals, they just turn off.
[01:13:15.075 --> 01:13:17.176]  They think, well, hey, I don't like the opposite sex.
[01:13:17.176 --> 01:13:18.816]  What are you talking about?
[01:13:18.816 --> 01:13:23.697]  Uh, it doesn't matter anymore whether we, you know, whether we have sex with the same sex, opposite sex.
[01:13:23.697 --> 01:13:25.938]  It's a whole metrosexual thing.
[01:13:25.938 --> 01:13:27.098]  It's men aren't leaders.
[01:13:27.098 --> 01:13:28.698]  They're not hard chargers.
[01:13:28.698 --> 01:13:30.199]  They're upset about how they look.
[01:13:30.199 --> 01:13:30.659]  They nanny.
[01:13:31.676 --> 01:13:38.858]  The fact is that homosexuals, they don't get married, they don't want to get married, despite all the publicity that's being given to that.
[01:13:38.858 --> 01:13:44.599]  Homosexuals don't want to get married, they don't want to have children, and all they want to do is have sex.
[01:13:44.599 --> 01:13:45.279]  And guess what?
[01:13:45.279 --> 01:13:48.700]  Look around at heterosexuals, that's what's happening.
[01:13:48.700 --> 01:14:00.502]  If you define homosexuality as a gender identity disorder resulting in arrested development because you cannot bond permanently with a member of the opposite sex,
[01:14:01.644 --> 01:14:02.745]  That's us.
[01:14:02.745 --> 01:14:04.646]  That's heterosexuals these days.
[01:14:04.646 --> 01:14:06.688]  We can't bond permanently.
[01:14:06.688 --> 01:14:18.197]  And this is the reason that we're having pornography pushed at us, because they just want us to have sex, but they don't want us to have families.
[01:14:18.197 --> 01:14:18.737]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:14:18.737 --> 01:14:20.258]  Continue.
[01:14:20.258 --> 01:14:25.763]  Well, it's so pervasive, it's just ridiculous.
[01:14:25.763 --> 01:14:28.465]  Like, two of the latest advertisements I've seen
[01:14:29.594 --> 01:14:35.618]  Uh, one is the Dairy Queen ad, where a little girl and her mother are in a Dairy Queen.
[01:14:35.618 --> 01:14:37.300]  She says, just order one.
[01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:42.463]  And she's picked out some pigeon, some guy, a little boy who was flirting with her.
[01:14:42.463 --> 01:14:46.026]  And then, sure enough, the boy buys her a sundae.
[01:14:46.026 --> 01:14:48.147]  So, mom only had to buy one for herself.
[01:14:48.147 --> 01:14:50.329]  It's about the manipulation of the dumb males, yes.
[01:14:51.010 --> 01:14:56.256]  Yeah, and then the little girl says, it's like shooting fish in a barrel.
[01:14:56.256 --> 01:14:58.920]  Come on, what kind of values are those?
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:01.623]  They're teaching us an us-against-them mentality.
[01:15:02.719 --> 01:15:08.323]  When really, women, they want to take men away from you so they can sterilize you and have their way with you.
[01:15:08.323 --> 01:15:12.065]  So when you're dying of your cancer viruses they've implanted, nobody's there to help you.
[01:15:12.065 --> 01:15:12.425]  Go ahead.
[01:15:12.425 --> 01:15:19.410]  Right, and there's a Wrigley Spearman commercial where basically the gum lasts longer.
[01:15:19.410 --> 01:15:22.712]  He gives the bouquet to the girl at the door.
[01:15:22.712 --> 01:15:27.075]  She runs through the whole sequence of the relationship and breaks up with him at the door.
[01:15:27.771 --> 01:15:31.975]  And then the punchline is, hey, stick to gum.
[01:15:31.975 --> 01:15:33.416]  It lasts longer.
[01:15:33.416 --> 01:15:40.942]  You know, two very recent examples, but there's hundreds of them, of this constant attack on heterosexuality.
[01:15:40.942 --> 01:15:42.904]  There's an attack on fidelity.
[01:15:42.904 --> 01:15:46.347]  There's an attack on unions and bulwarks.
[01:15:46.347 --> 01:15:54.794]  And they said 90 years ago and 80 years ago in the Carnegie Endowment that they had to encourage relationships that break up.
[01:15:55.474 --> 01:16:11.383]  For sure, and to justify all this immigration and so on.
[01:16:11.383 --> 01:16:18.247]  If our populations are down, we have to have immigration, and then the population is totally heterogeneous.
[01:16:18.247 --> 01:16:20.028]  There's no commonality.
[01:16:20.028 --> 01:16:23.650]  It's all part of this grand re-engineering of the human race.
[01:16:24.784 --> 01:16:32.707]  Which involves destroying race, religion, family, and nation.
[01:16:32.707 --> 01:16:35.309]  So they can replace it.
[01:16:35.309 --> 01:16:36.889]  I have the Department of Education documents.
[01:16:36.889 --> 01:16:38.530]  I know you have them as well.
[01:16:38.530 --> 01:16:39.210]  And they have.
[01:16:39.210 --> 01:16:39.971]  They've destroyed us.
[01:16:39.971 --> 01:16:41.151]  You look at the public.
[01:16:41.151 --> 01:16:47.974]  They are a bunch of dumbed down, don't care about anyone, aren't happy because all of their true tribal instincts have been destroyed.
[01:16:49.873 --> 01:16:50.713]  Exactly.
[01:16:50.713 --> 01:16:55.075]  And I think, Alex, I think we want to look at who's behind this.
[01:16:55.075 --> 01:16:57.055]  You mentioned the Carnegie Endowment.
[01:16:57.055 --> 01:17:18.082]  It's basically the Rockefellers who are basically the nominees for the Rothschilds in the United States, and it's basically the World Central Banking Cartel and their allies, which, you know, the Masons are their big, important network, and organized jewelry is one of their instruments as well.
[01:17:18.971 --> 01:17:22.876]  And by the way, you're Jewish and you're saying that.
[01:17:22.876 --> 01:17:31.086]  I'm Jewish and I'm saying it because I'm making the point that most Jews, in my opinion, don't believe this is happening and aren't aware it's happening.
[01:17:31.086 --> 01:17:37.715]  They don't realize that organized Jewry is being run by the central bankers and is pushing the same agenda.
[01:17:38.839 --> 01:17:54.487]  Well, I mean, there's no doubt that you have a lot of folks in technology and in the sciences and Bernays and a lot of others pushing it, and it's just so completely cold-blooded to see this being done to society so we're a more manageable, mindless, leaderless herd.
[01:17:54.487 --> 01:18:05.853]  The point is that these central bankers, using the Rockefeller Foundation, they've taken over all the institutions in our society.
[01:18:07.202 --> 01:18:15.955]  First of all, the interlocking directorate that they own, they own most of the major corporations or control them.
[01:18:15.955 --> 01:18:17.858]  And then they've taken over the churches.
[01:18:18.533 --> 01:18:20.153]  They've taken over the charity.
[01:18:20.153 --> 01:18:27.055]  And they started it all, World Council, National Council of Churches, the National Association of Governors, every major group.
[01:18:27.055 --> 01:18:28.496]  You go look, they founded it.
[01:18:28.496 --> 01:18:32.297]  The state police in 33, they got it chartered as federal police.
[01:18:32.297 --> 01:18:33.817]  They run it all, folks.
[01:18:33.817 --> 01:18:37.998]  They studied how to put cancer viruses and vaccines in the 20s, all public.
[01:18:37.998 --> 01:18:40.439]  They're the ones running eugenics on you.
[01:18:40.439 --> 01:18:43.220]  It's just, it's nightmarish, Henry.
[01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:47.221]  That's right, and I think we have to recognize the fact that this is a satanic cult.
[01:18:47.967 --> 01:18:53.510]  That has, for centuries, been wanting to basically take over the human race.
[01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:56.952]  We're under attack from a satanic cult.
[01:18:56.952 --> 01:19:01.034]  And the people say, well, what makes them satanic?
[01:19:01.034 --> 01:19:03.916]  It's when men decide they're God.
[01:19:03.916 --> 01:19:05.937]  That's when they become satanic.
[01:19:05.937 --> 01:19:10.099]  And then on top of it, they decide that their evil self-interest
[01:19:10.988 --> 01:19:11.328]  I think?
[01:19:34.021 --> 01:19:35.182]  Stay there, stay there!
[01:19:35.182 --> 01:19:44.611]  Quick, we'll come right back with Henry McHale, PhD, best-selling author, as you know, one of the makers of the most popular board games as well.
[01:19:44.611 --> 01:19:48.694]  Regardless if you believe in God or not, the globalists do, and they are worshippers of Lucifer.
[01:19:48.694 --> 01:19:49.475]  They're not very friendly.
[01:19:51.064 --> 01:20:04.195]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:20:04.195 --> 01:20:15.283]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:20:15.283 --> 01:20:17.425]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose
[01:20:18.686 --> 01:20:20.427]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:20:20.427 --> 01:20:26.551]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[01:20:50.810 --> 01:20:54.753]  Ted Anderson from Midas, May 19, 2008, gold, 90670 ounce gold coins can be purchased for 932.99, 459.55 per half, 229.78 per quarter.
[01:20:54.753 --> 01:20:55.214]  That's 932.99, 459.55, and 229.78.
[01:21:06.664 --> 01:21:10.347]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[01:21:10.347 --> 01:21:13.450]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[01:21:13.450 --> 01:21:22.938]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[01:21:22.938 --> 01:21:28.263]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[01:21:28.743 --> 01:21:31.105]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[01:21:31.105 --> 01:21:33.968]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[01:21:33.968 --> 01:21:35.670]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:21:35.670 --> 01:21:37.632]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[01:21:37.632 --> 01:21:38.393]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:38.393 --> 01:21:39.113]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:21:39.113 --> 01:21:39.153]  800-686-2237.
[01:21:51.744 --> 01:21:55.525]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:21:55.525 --> 01:22:00.547]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:22:00.547 --> 01:22:06.009]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:22:06.009 --> 01:22:16.492]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:22:16.992 --> 01:22:21.394]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:22:21.394 --> 01:22:24.175]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[01:22:24.175 --> 01:22:27.737]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:22:27.737 --> 01:22:40.243]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.
[01:22:40.723 --> 01:22:44.464]  Visit our website at unveilingthem.com.
[01:22:44.464 --> 01:22:48.745]  That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G them dot com.
[01:22:48.745 --> 01:22:50.706]  The message of his kingdom.
[01:22:50.706 --> 01:22:56.547]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment.
[01:22:56.547 --> 01:23:01.629]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[01:23:01.969 --> 01:23:07.333]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[01:23:07.333 --> 01:23:13.258]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[01:23:13.258 --> 01:23:19.483]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[01:23:19.483 --> 01:23:22.986]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[01:23:23.246 --> 01:23:28.070]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:29.130]  Do your part.
[01:23:29.130 --> 01:23:31.752]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[01:23:31.752 --> 01:23:40.959]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.

[01:23:57.312 --> 01:23:59.133]  I bet the fake feminists don't like this!
[01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:22.895]  It's a death-defying life I lead.
[01:24:22.895 --> 01:24:24.937]  I take my chances.
[01:24:24.937 --> 01:24:27.781]  I die for a living in the movies and TV.
[01:24:30.273 --> 01:24:33.055]  Yeah, they don't want men to be men.
[01:24:33.055 --> 01:24:35.256]  They don't want women to be women.
[01:24:53.303 --> 01:24:56.264]  I watch all these feminists, 40, 45, 50.
[01:24:56.264 --> 01:24:58.626]  Clock's ticking, they've made a million dollars.
[01:24:58.626 --> 01:24:59.706]  None of it means anything to them.
[01:24:59.706 --> 01:25:02.027]  They try to go out and find a man, have kids.
[01:25:02.027 --> 01:25:04.468]  They usually can't by then.
[01:25:04.468 --> 01:25:06.890]  Or they drive off their first three or four husbands.
[01:25:06.890 --> 01:25:09.751]  Some of them wake up and then find out that they don't want to dominate their man.
[01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:13.323]  Uh, and then, uh, they finally are happy, but most of them aren't.
[01:25:13.323 --> 01:25:19.969]  They get more and more bitter, more and more man-hating, more and more crazy when they're just chopping off their own nose for their own face.
[01:25:19.969 --> 01:25:23.272]  Now, the globalists have also turned men into lazy animals.
[01:25:23.272 --> 01:25:24.574]  The programming's worked that way, too.
[01:25:25.453 --> 01:25:32.815]  You know, women are shown the male on the Fox TV shows who's an idiot moron and he gets all the girls.
[01:25:32.815 --> 01:25:36.496]  Then the young males go out and act like idiot morons and don't get the girls.
[01:25:36.496 --> 01:25:41.597]  Or they get girls that think that's what they're supposed to get but then it doesn't satisfy them for some reason.
[01:25:41.597 --> 01:25:43.157]  All scientifically done.
[01:25:43.157 --> 01:25:44.678]  We're all in this together.
[01:25:44.678 --> 01:25:46.038]  In fact, Henry McHale, PhD,
[01:25:47.018 --> 01:25:48.239]  SaveTheMales.ca.
[01:25:48.239 --> 01:25:50.341]  You're not saying it's an us against them.
[01:25:50.341 --> 01:25:54.445]  You're saying that's a fraud, that's a lie, that's a false paradigm.
[01:25:54.445 --> 01:25:56.286]  Break that down for us.
[01:25:56.286 --> 01:26:00.170]  Well, young women have been betrayed big time.
[01:26:00.170 --> 01:26:05.414]  They're being betrayed by their teachers, by their government, by society in general.
[01:26:05.414 --> 01:26:11.760]  And, I mean, women have about 10 years to make their deal at most.
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.181]  You know, 17 to 27.
[01:26:13.181 --> 01:26:14.442]  That's when they're attractive to men.
[01:26:15.234 --> 01:26:20.498]  And after that, it's a steep and slippery slope.
[01:26:20.498 --> 01:26:24.281]  Men are attracted to women who are at the height of their fertility.
[01:26:24.281 --> 01:26:25.882]  That's nature.
[01:26:25.882 --> 01:26:31.406]  And these Luciferians, they want to rewrite nature and pretend that women in their 40s and 50s are attractive to men.
[01:26:31.406 --> 01:26:32.787]  Physically, they're not.
[01:26:32.787 --> 01:26:39.772]  By that time, men and women will have been married 20 years or more, and they have established a strong bond.
[01:26:40.359 --> 01:26:45.423]  Based on other things, and they've had enough sex, that there are other, more important things in life.
[01:26:45.423 --> 01:26:47.585]  So sexual attraction doesn't matter.
[01:26:47.585 --> 01:26:49.507]  So the women who are missing... Yeah, it's now a family.
[01:26:49.507 --> 01:26:51.749]  It's about taking care of the children that are in college.
[01:26:51.749 --> 01:26:53.831]  It's about the family.
[01:26:53.831 --> 01:26:54.571]  Exactly.
[01:26:54.571 --> 01:27:00.817]  I mean, they brainwash us to think that sex is necessary and blah, blah, blah.
[01:27:00.817 --> 01:27:06.982]  Andy Warhol says the biggest nothing there is, it only becomes an issue if you don't get it, and they're making sure we, you know,
[01:27:08.118 --> 01:27:09.099]  We don't.
[01:27:09.099 --> 01:27:11.440]  Because we're, you know, or we're obsessed with it because we don't marry.
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:22.888]  Yeah, they somehow taught women that it's something they dangle out to men and all men have done is gone and got into porn, which they actually study show, then actually destroys your sexual desire.
[01:27:22.888 --> 01:27:27.051]  Sure, I mean, it makes you sick of women and sick of sex.
[01:27:27.051 --> 01:27:36.377]  But the bottom line is that women have been betrayed and men have got to somehow re-educate young women to realize that they have to
[01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:42.373]  Well, let me just say this, women, you don't like the man, you know, being who you defer to on some issues.
[01:27:42.373 --> 01:27:46.476]  Well, you're just going to be fighting all the time, and now the state is your boss.
[01:27:46.476 --> 01:27:49.237]  I mean, do you want a man, or do you want the state?
[01:28:07.925 --> 01:28:08.606]  Absolutely.
[01:28:08.606 --> 01:28:12.808]  Do you want someone who loves you and is willing to devote his life to you?
[01:28:12.808 --> 01:28:15.350]  Or do you want the state who really doesn't give a shit?
[01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.971]  Or some corporate boss?
[01:28:15.971 --> 01:28:17.111]  Hey Doc, we can't talk like that.
[01:28:17.111 --> 01:28:19.393]  I'm going to have to let you go if you do that again, okay?
[01:28:19.393 --> 01:28:19.953]  Okay.
[01:28:19.953 --> 01:28:21.194]  Just one more.
[01:28:21.194 --> 01:28:22.375]  I'm serious.
[01:28:22.375 --> 01:28:22.655]  Okay.
[01:28:22.655 --> 01:28:23.176]  You can't do that.
[01:28:23.176 --> 01:28:24.076]  This is actual radio.
[01:28:24.076 --> 01:28:27.318]  This isn't one of those tinker toy play radio networks, okay?
[01:28:27.318 --> 01:28:27.739]  Okay.
[01:28:27.739 --> 01:28:28.499]  I'm not mad at you.
[01:28:28.499 --> 01:28:29.120]  Just don't do it again.
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.000]  Go ahead.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:30.641]  Okay.
[01:28:30.641 --> 01:28:37.005]  Well anyway, or do you want your corporate boss to be responsible for your life?
[01:28:38.413 --> 01:28:44.515]  So, the key is that men have been turned into wimps.
[01:28:44.515 --> 01:28:49.457]  Essentially, they've managed to disempower men by empowering women.
[01:28:49.457 --> 01:28:51.057]  It's like a seesaw.
[01:28:51.057 --> 01:28:54.498]  The way men are empowered is when women defer to men.
[01:28:54.498 --> 01:28:56.939]  Women are designed to empower men.
[01:28:56.939 --> 01:29:02.141]  Men are designed to use that power to protect women.
[01:29:02.141 --> 01:29:08.143]  But when they empower women, men aren't designed to compete and fight with women, and men just
[01:29:08.553 --> 01:29:11.625]  Essentially, they get emasculated.
[01:29:12.819 --> 01:29:16.021]  Well, they retreat into the trappings of masculinity.
[01:29:16.021 --> 01:29:16.842]  Some of them do.
[01:29:16.842 --> 01:29:18.603]  Or they retreat into feminimity.
[01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:20.264]  Stay there, Dr. Henry McCall.
[01:29:20.264 --> 01:29:22.646]  We really appreciate you coming on with us.
[01:29:22.646 --> 01:29:27.309]  And the website is SaveTheMales.ca.
[01:29:27.309 --> 01:29:28.931]  Really interesting research he's done.
[01:29:28.931 --> 01:29:32.313]  Let's get more into the history of feminism and your research on it.
[01:29:32.313 --> 01:29:35.695]  I've been jumping in a lot because everything he's saying is so true.
[01:29:35.695 --> 01:29:40.519]  And then we'll continue and get some into the research he's been doing on how they're still killing Native Americans.
[01:29:41.219 --> 01:29:45.161]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:45.161 --> 01:29:51.463]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:51.463 --> 01:29:52.884]  It is a big idea.
[01:29:52.884 --> 01:29:55.725]  A new world order.
[01:29:55.725 --> 01:29:59.987]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:30:00.798 --> 01:30:03.419]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:30:03.419 --> 01:30:06.220]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:09.401]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:30:09.401 --> 01:30:16.704]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:30:19.744 --> 01:30:25.208]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:30:25.208 --> 01:30:29.070]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:31.632]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:30:31.632 --> 01:30:32.793]  Most people have no idea.
[01:30:32.793 --> 01:30:33.573]  They're not after money.
[01:30:33.573 --> 01:30:34.854]  They have all the money they need.
[01:30:34.854 --> 01:30:35.835]  They're after power.
[01:30:35.835 --> 01:30:36.996]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:30:48.503 --> 01:30:49.564]  You have been warned.
[01:30:50.464 --> 01:30:55.808]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity theft each year.
[01:30:55.808 --> 01:31:01.852]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an average of $8,000.
[01:31:01.852 --> 01:31:08.676]  If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication, and often the only protection between a hacker and your personal information.
[01:31:08.996 --> 01:31:17.999]  Passwords that are stored in a spreadsheet, text file, data file, or any other file that is not encrypted and password protected are vulnerable to malicious theft and misuse.

[01:32:41.630 --> 01:32:42.831]  We're competing with each other.
[01:33:02.978 --> 01:33:08.244]  It's completely unnatural.
[01:33:08.244 --> 01:33:11.908]  Our women are honored.
[01:33:11.908 --> 01:33:16.273]  Our women are the centers of the family.
[01:33:16.273 --> 01:33:20.278]  And women always instinctively have understood that they are the center of the family.
[01:33:20.962 --> 01:33:22.403]  And they've got to support their men.
[01:33:22.403 --> 01:33:27.027]  Now, in rare cases, you've got drunks or scum, and the society falls apart more and more.
[01:33:27.027 --> 01:33:30.570]  But used to, this woman would have brothers and family who wouldn't put up with that.
[01:33:30.570 --> 01:33:32.731]  And occasionally, you know, things broke up and happened bad.
[01:33:32.731 --> 01:33:37.975]  But we've gone from 90-plus percent legitimacy to now over half illegitimacy.
[01:33:37.975 --> 01:33:39.176]  And Henry McHale is our guest.
[01:33:39.176 --> 01:33:41.518]  Some of the other news in front of us today.
[01:33:41.518 --> 01:33:42.078]  Warning!
[01:33:42.078 --> 01:33:45.301]  Using mobile phones while pregnant can seriously damage your baby.
[01:33:45.993 --> 01:33:46.954]  Another big report there.
[01:33:46.954 --> 01:33:50.118]  Iran busts CIA-backed terror group, and the U.S.
[01:33:50.118 --> 01:33:54.864]  admits they have al-Qaeda inside Iran, blowing up schools, mosques, killing people.
[01:33:54.864 --> 01:33:59.831]  And now they just admitted on the news, Neocon General calls for more terror attacks inside Iran.
[01:33:59.831 --> 01:34:03.796]  I mean, these people are... and then using al-Qaeda, while saying that Iran is al-Qaeda.
[01:34:05.115 --> 01:34:07.577]  Immigration agency plans new family detention centers.
[01:34:07.577 --> 01:34:09.318]  They want to build camps all over the country.
[01:34:09.318 --> 01:34:11.199]  That's just the front for building the camps.
[01:34:11.199 --> 01:34:12.560]  It's really for citizens.
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:14.902]  And the actual documents admit that.
[01:34:14.902 --> 01:34:16.122]  Get into that later.
[01:34:16.122 --> 01:34:17.103]  Also nations.
[01:34:17.103 --> 01:34:20.105]  Bush tells the Arabs are running out of oil, which isn't true.
[01:34:20.105 --> 01:34:22.827]  Obama camp spies in-game in Oregon.
[01:34:22.827 --> 01:34:24.508]  Says we are all eating too much food.
[01:34:24.508 --> 01:34:26.929]  The government should regulate our calories.
[01:34:26.929 --> 01:34:29.371]  Everything's going to be micromanaged under the nanny state.
[01:34:29.371 --> 01:34:30.752]  It's going to be our mommy.
[01:34:31.417 --> 01:34:36.140]  See, mommies can't be mommies, but the state's going to be our mommy.
[01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:39.061]  31,000 scientists rejecting global warming, man-made global warming.
[01:34:39.061 --> 01:34:43.484]  Dutch newspaper says Bilderberg to meet in Washington June 5th through the 8th.
[01:34:43.484 --> 01:34:47.626]  That is just some of the news we'll be going over.
[01:34:47.626 --> 01:34:55.891]  Going back to Henry McCall, PhD, continue with the history, how this got going, and some of the documentation you've uncovered.
[01:34:55.891 --> 01:35:00.173]  Okay, well, you know,
[01:35:00.726 --> 01:35:06.149]  If your listeners haven't read the Protocols of Elder's Design, they better read them.
[01:35:06.149 --> 01:35:09.351]  Because, in my opinion, they're genuine.
[01:35:09.351 --> 01:35:13.773]  And they reflect a centuries-old plan to take over the world.
[01:35:13.773 --> 01:35:24.018]  And essentially, the power behind this, as far as I can see, is the central banking cartel, because they've got our credit cards.
[01:35:24.018 --> 01:35:29.081]  They've got control over our credit, which they use to print money at will,
[01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:38.125]  And they have used that money to basically buy everything and everyone worth buying.
[01:35:38.125 --> 01:35:42.927]  They're behind communism.
[01:35:42.927 --> 01:35:50.652]  They're behind the Communist Party of the United States.
[01:35:50.652 --> 01:35:52.573]  They had Betty Friedan.
[01:35:52.573 --> 01:35:54.254]  Betty Friedan was a communist.
[01:35:54.254 --> 01:35:57.336]  She's the founder of second-wave feminism.
[01:35:57.336 --> 01:35:59.317]  Everything that second-wave feminism
[01:36:00.143 --> 01:36:00.303]  I don't
[01:36:11.590 --> 01:36:17.913]  These communists are the daughters of these communists who are known as red stocking babies.
[01:36:17.913 --> 01:36:28.918]  And it's the same thing with the neocons, they're all fourth wave trotskyites, the communist international.
[01:36:28.918 --> 01:36:32.940]  Now understand, the bankers created communism, they're not really communists, they communize our wealth.
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:40.945]  Like a mosquito injects a anticoagulant to suck out your juices, they communize it, destroy the family, then suck it out.
[01:36:40.945 --> 01:36:44.308]  My only issue here is I have no doubt that Zionism's virulent and...
[01:36:45.194 --> 01:36:59.823]  involved a lot of powerful things in banking and certainly part of but I've really studied the core documents it is like a merger with that and the Anglo-American British elite and then the whole Germanic system is also to regulate and control and carry out eugenics.
[01:36:59.823 --> 01:37:07.908]  I mean, can you explain to me why the Zionists are carrying out a Nazi-style eugenics policy against blacks, Asians, and Latin Americans?
[01:37:07.908 --> 01:37:12.791]  Well, it's because the central bankers seem to subscribe to
[01:37:14.551 --> 01:37:14.991]  I think?
[01:37:28.931 --> 01:37:35.679]  And they've amalgamated with all the other elites and converted them to this Satanism.
[01:37:35.679 --> 01:37:40.184]  Well, I mean, that's what I want to be clear about here, is I go where the truth is, okay?
[01:37:40.184 --> 01:37:49.515]  And, you know, we see the Vatican pushing the New World Order, we see Protestant leaders pushing the New World Order, and obviously we see people that support, you know, Zionism pushing it in at the highest levels.
[01:37:51.456 --> 01:37:55.938]  My whole deal is that there's other people who say, no, it's got to be the Catholics and only the Catholics.
[01:37:55.938 --> 01:37:59.040]  There's people that say, no, it's got to be the Zionists and only the Zionists.
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.761]  Or, no, it's got to be the British and only the British.
[01:38:00.761 --> 01:38:11.147]  And I'm saying, you know, that it turns into a contentious issue where we all then just, and we're not doing this, but others, fight over, well, no, it's only this group in control.
[01:38:11.147 --> 01:38:15.289]  And I've done legitimate, real study, and I've found that at the top of the pyramid, it's like,
[01:38:16.391 --> 01:38:19.413]  A bunch of pyramids going together into a super pyramid.
[01:38:19.413 --> 01:38:20.933]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:38:20.933 --> 01:38:22.994]  Absolutely, and God bless you, Alex.
[01:38:22.994 --> 01:38:24.775]  I totally agree with you.
[01:38:24.775 --> 01:38:34.340]  I mean, they have basically co-opted all the elites, and so it's like arguing whether it's the New York mob or the Chicago mob or the L.A.
[01:38:34.340 --> 01:38:35.140]  mob.
[01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:37.241]  It's all the mob.
[01:38:37.241 --> 01:38:45.025]  They all belong to the same satanic cult, and in a sense they confuse us by showing us different faces.
[01:38:45.819 --> 01:38:51.623]  But it's the same phenomenon.
[01:38:51.623 --> 01:38:57.407]  Okay, so, but I mean, getting back more into the history of feminism, talk to me about your book, about The Cruel Hoax.
[01:38:57.407 --> 01:39:07.494]  Well, The Cruel Hoax essentially contains all my research from the first six years of my website, including the article Betty Friedan, Mommy Was a Commie,
[01:39:08.468 --> 01:39:14.312]  And, uh, just showing that, you know, she was a communist, but, uh, they, they, essentially they use dupes.
[01:39:14.312 --> 01:39:19.395]  They use people who, uh, who are, uh, misguided and actually believe what they're saying.
[01:39:19.395 --> 01:39:28.681]  But if, if what they're saying, uh, pushes their agenda, the Illuminati agenda, uh, the banker agenda, then they finance them and they, and they really hype them up.
[01:39:28.681 --> 01:39:34.684]  So, uh, Betty Friedan was, you know, was a dupe, and a dupe is far more effective than a conscious agent.
[01:39:34.684 --> 01:39:35.545]  Because they mean well.
[01:39:36.283 --> 01:39:37.343]  Yeah, they mean well.
[01:39:37.343 --> 01:39:41.524]  And those good intentions communicate.
[01:39:41.524 --> 01:39:45.045]  Similarly, I think, you know, possibly Adolf Hitler was a dupe.
[01:39:45.045 --> 01:39:48.346]  But let's not go there right now.
[01:39:48.346 --> 01:39:52.246]  Okay, another thing they control... Well, there's no maybe Hitler was a dupe.
[01:39:52.246 --> 01:40:04.149]  Lord Milner, the head British lord, talked about in the teens how decades later they were going to engineer a German strongman and then set him up and let him tear the hell out of Europe and then come in and take over.
[01:40:04.975 --> 01:40:05.556]  Exactly.
[01:40:05.556 --> 01:40:07.317]  They put Hitler into power.
[01:40:07.317 --> 01:40:08.798]  And they kept him in power.
[01:40:08.798 --> 01:40:16.084]  Now, another thing, the way they control society, probably one of the most effective ways is their control of intelligence agencies.
[01:40:16.084 --> 01:40:30.775]  It all starts with MI6, that's the mother of all Masonic... And they admittedly run all the high-class brothels, where they then just shut people up and it comes out that they run the brothels, they ship the drugs, and they just say that's how it is.
[01:40:30.775 --> 01:40:32.576]  And, you know, look what happened to Eliot Spitzer.
[01:40:32.576 --> 01:40:34.578]  He got out of line and, you know,
[01:40:35.034 --> 01:40:38.556]  They had the info on them and they got rid of them.
[01:40:38.556 --> 01:40:52.283]  But, and so, the reason I mentioned the intelligence agencies, you know, the Masons, I see Freemasonry as just sort of a branch of the Kabbalah, basically Judaism for Gentiles, but the Freemasons don't realize this.
[01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:57.645]  I don't think the Jews even realize what they're involved in, what has happened to Judaism.
[01:40:57.645 --> 01:41:01.529]  I don't think it's any longer a monotheistic religion.
[01:41:01.529 --> 01:41:05.173]  Well, there's no secret that... I'm not even sure if it's a religion anymore.
[01:41:05.173 --> 01:41:11.160]  Yeah, but there's no secret that Kabbalah and the Kabbalah all goes back to Egypt.
[01:41:11.770 --> 01:41:16.272]  And then Babylon, and so all your major occultic religions go back.
[01:41:16.272 --> 01:41:30.277]  I think it's an overstatement to say that Jewish mysticism runs the gamut and is the dominant force, because it itself is just a brand of Babylonian mystery religion slash Egyptian.
[01:41:30.277 --> 01:41:36.579]  Okay, you know, like you said, I'm not going to play, like you, I don't want to play the game of where the responsibility lies.
[01:41:36.579 --> 01:41:38.540]  It's certainly spread widely.
[01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:39.780]  That's always been my point.
[01:41:40.276 --> 01:41:42.838]  And I'm glad to hear that it's your point, too.
[01:41:42.838 --> 01:41:54.004]  Anyway, the reason I mentioned the intelligence agencies is CIA was started up by the, you know, MI6 through OSF, and essentially the central bankers run the CIA.
[01:41:54.004 --> 01:41:57.947]  Sure, there's a lot of little, you know, cells of the CIA that aren't aware of this.
[01:41:57.947 --> 01:41:59.788]  Oh, no, I mean, we're skull and bones.
[01:41:59.788 --> 01:42:04.791]  People have commanded the entire CIA and still does, and that's all out of one university.
[01:42:05.672 --> 01:42:11.934]  And Gloria Steinem, I mentioned Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem was a CIA agent.
[01:42:11.934 --> 01:42:13.655]  She wrote that in one of her books.
[01:42:13.655 --> 01:42:32.462]  Yeah, she worked for the CIA and you know whether she was on, you know, officially working for them or not, she was essentially doing their will when she, you know, pulls the playboy bunny and you know, essentially they run the magazines, CIA, they run Esquire that ran Gloria Steinem's story that made her famous.
[01:42:33.177 --> 01:42:38.320]  They ran New York Magazine, which later hired Gloria Steinem anyway.
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:44.144]  She became, with Betty Friedan, the other great leader of second-wave feminism.
[01:42:44.144 --> 01:42:53.929]  And again, like Friedan, who worked for the Communist Party, which was central banker-controlled, Steinem worked for the CIA, which is central banker-controlled.
[01:42:53.929 --> 01:43:01.834]  The whole feminist movement was led by the central banker agents, or central banker dupes,
[01:43:02.469 --> 01:43:04.831]  It was financed and promoted by them.
[01:43:04.831 --> 01:43:14.239]  And what I say often in my articles in my book is that if you Google Rockefeller Foundation and Women's Studies, you'll get something like 90,000.
[01:43:14.239 --> 01:43:16.621]  Oh yeah, it's incredible.
[01:43:16.621 --> 01:43:23.867]  I mean, they funded thousands of different organizations and groups, thousands of eugenics groups, hundreds of major foundations.
[01:43:23.867 --> 01:43:25.909]  I mean, it is just mind-blowing.
[01:43:27.265 --> 01:43:27.766]  Exactly.
[01:43:27.766 --> 01:43:29.307]  We're in a laboratory.
[01:43:29.307 --> 01:43:30.228]  We're the subject.
[01:43:30.228 --> 01:43:37.654]  We can't trust anything we're taught in school, anything we hear on the radio, anything we read in a book or in a magazine.
[01:43:37.654 --> 01:43:39.415]  We can't trust anybody.
[01:43:39.415 --> 01:43:43.699]  But I will say to your listeners, I like what I hear Alex Jones saying.
[01:43:43.699 --> 01:43:45.320]  I think we can trust Alex Jones.
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:48.062]  I think we can trust Jeff Wentz, too.
[01:43:48.062 --> 01:43:51.325]  And there's a few other people like Michael Rivero.
[01:43:51.325 --> 01:43:55.609]  Thank God we have a few courageous men standing up who I think
[01:43:58.835 --> 01:44:05.280]  Well, you have to judge somebody by their long-term track record and the fruits that they bear, and you really shouldn't even trust us, folks.
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:12.225]  You should go out and make your own decisions, and you know you're good, so you need to get involved.
[01:44:12.225 --> 01:44:14.307]  And, of course, an agent will never tell you that.
[01:44:14.307 --> 01:44:20.252]  An agent will never tell you to take action, get involved, do good things, fight the New World Order, fight for sovereignty.
[01:44:20.252 --> 01:44:21.693]  If you notice, I am
[01:44:23.104 --> 01:44:51.366]  You know, you used to have on your website on, I think, Prison Planet a quote from Alexander Shvolginitsa, where he says if, when they started rounding us up, if they realized that they could be shot, they might have put a whole different color on it.
[01:44:51.366 --> 01:44:52.087]  Remember that quote?
[01:44:52.788 --> 01:45:05.451]  Yeah, he said, oh, how we burned in the camps, wishing that when they came to pick us up one-on-one at night, we would have met them in the stairwells, you know, in the foyers, in the apartments with daggers and pokers and hatchets, basically as a paraphrase.
[01:45:05.451 --> 01:45:09.992]  And then they would have stopped them, which is what the drug cartels know, CIA run.
[01:45:09.992 --> 01:45:14.353]  They're telling Mexican police, join us or die, Associated Press.
[01:45:14.353 --> 01:45:16.374]  So this is all just survival of the fittest.
[01:45:16.374 --> 01:45:17.374]  But go ahead, Henry.
[01:45:18.584 --> 01:45:26.228]  Well, I think you're just making the point that, I mean, things have gone to the point where in the United States, it is legal.
[01:45:26.228 --> 01:45:29.190]  You still have a constitutional right to defend yourself.
[01:45:29.190 --> 01:45:37.175]  And, you know, I think Americans need to defend, be prepared to defend themselves.
[01:45:37.175 --> 01:45:44.739]  But, you know, if they don't have weapons, they ought to, if they don't know how to use them, they ought to know how to use them.
[01:45:44.739 --> 01:45:46.200]  Henry, where do you see all this going?
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:57.027]  Well, you know, there is a sense of urgency, but I tend not to panic.
[01:45:57.027 --> 01:46:01.931]  I tend to detect a long-term agenda on their part.
[01:46:01.931 --> 01:46:08.737]  If you look in terms of five, ten years, things are moving rapidly in their favor culturally.
[01:46:08.737 --> 01:46:14.422]  I think their agenda is more to enslave us than to absolutely kill us.
[01:46:15.502 --> 01:46:17.944]  And they're doing a good job of enslaving us.
[01:46:17.944 --> 01:46:21.647]  You can see the changes if you look at it a decade at a time.
[01:46:21.647 --> 01:46:24.709]  So I sort of see more of the same going.
[01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:34.577]  Now whether they'll actually pull off a third world war on us, that seems to be in the program.
[01:46:34.577 --> 01:46:38.180]  But it doesn't make a lot of sense.
[01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:38.860]  For a number of reasons.
[01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:41.943]  They own all the property anyway, why would they want to destroy it?
[01:46:41.943 --> 01:46:45.005]  Plus they kill all the people, then that just destroys supply and demand.
[01:46:45.623 --> 01:46:49.164]  All their gold, if no one wants it, is not going to be worth anything.
[01:46:49.164 --> 01:46:53.185]  And on top of it, if you look at us slaves, I mean, we're debt slaves.
[01:46:53.185 --> 01:46:54.125]  I mean, they kill us.
[01:46:54.125 --> 01:46:55.946]  They'll never collect on the debt.
[01:46:55.946 --> 01:46:58.987]  So I tend to see us muddling on.
[01:46:58.987 --> 01:47:06.389]  I see things getting worse, but I don't see a catastrophe.
[01:47:06.389 --> 01:47:09.390]  I don't see an imminent catastrophe.
[01:47:09.390 --> 01:47:10.850]  That's just my sense of things.
[01:47:12.967 --> 01:47:35.144]  There's a New York Times story today where they kind of celebrate that it's up by 40 plus percent, the number of tattletale phone calls, and the people call up begging, saying, my grandson smokes marijuana, come arrest him, I need 500 bucks, to train a grandmother to turn her grandson in, or a woman to turn her husband in for money.
[01:47:35.144 --> 01:47:40.929]  The, you know, the grubbing, the falling over themselves for this green stuff that the globalists just print out of nothing.
[01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:51.602]  You know, you've essentially got the devil operating the money system and teaching us the value of money and nothing else.
[01:47:51.602 --> 01:47:55.502]  I mean, we live in a world that is controlled by the devil.
[01:47:55.502 --> 01:48:01.343]  Not just metaphorically, but the devil literally has his hands on the lever.
[01:48:01.343 --> 01:48:05.584]  We are talking about devil worshippers who control society.
[01:48:05.584 --> 01:48:11.265]  And our politicians, our Obamas and our McCains, these are just people who have satisfied the devil.
[01:48:11.946 --> 01:48:16.049]  Well, I just tend to look at the fact that trying to come between a mother and a baby
[01:48:35.976 --> 01:48:37.757]  They're trying to be a mother and her children.
[01:48:37.757 --> 01:48:45.784]  They're trying to come between men and women and men who have nothing but protective and loving feelings for women.
[01:48:45.784 --> 01:48:48.746]  I mean, that's one indication.
[01:48:48.746 --> 01:49:03.438]  Another, you know, the line in the Protocols, the original design that convinced me that the thing was authentic, was where the speaker says, already in our cities and towns, there is a cold and forlorn feeling among the public.
[01:49:04.902 --> 01:49:10.224]  That's just not the kind of thing that a hoaxer would think of to write.
[01:49:10.224 --> 01:49:28.470]  And the idea that he would take pleasure in the fact that the public is alienated and isolated, and we're talking about the late 19th century, and take chortle at the fact that there is a cold and forlorn feeling in society indicates that these people hate humanity.
[01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:30.131]  They hate humanity.
[01:49:30.131 --> 01:49:33.492]  And just as God loves humanity, and God is love,
[01:49:34.466 --> 01:49:39.552]  And God takes pride in humanity and wants us to know Him.
[01:49:39.552 --> 01:49:43.416]  The devil hates humanity and wants to enslave us, if not destroy us.
[01:49:43.416 --> 01:49:46.579]  So it's just little anecdotal things that have convinced me.
[01:49:46.579 --> 01:49:56.950]  I don't spend a lot of time reading, you know, Freemasonry and shit like that, because I can recognize a cesspool without getting into it by the smell.
[01:50:01.149 --> 01:50:11.136]  Well, Doc, the website SaveTheMales.ca, and again, your book walks through a lot of this.
[01:50:11.136 --> 01:50:20.522]  I appreciate you coming on the broadcast with us, and I know you've woken a lot of people up to what's happening with the New World Order.
[01:50:20.522 --> 01:50:25.385]  We can debate all day what group captains it, but there's no doubt the direction they're going in.
[01:50:25.913 --> 01:50:26.193]  I think so.
[01:50:51.243 --> 01:50:53.224]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:50:53.224 --> 01:50:56.826]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:50:56.826 --> 01:50:59.288]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:50:59.288 --> 01:51:02.330]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:51:02.330 --> 01:51:08.053]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:51:08.053 --> 01:51:11.976]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[01:52:50.851 --> 01:52:56.856]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?

[01:53:08.724 --> 01:53:09.865]  Here's the story.
[01:53:09.865 --> 01:53:18.033]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[01:53:18.033 --> 01:53:19.194]  And here's the best part.
[01:53:19.194 --> 01:53:20.876]  It's 100% legal.
[01:53:20.876 --> 01:53:23.719]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries.
[01:53:24.259 --> 01:53:24.880]  I think so.
[01:54:06.158 --> 01:54:28.403]  I'm gonna chase the sky forever With the woman and the stallion and the wind And the sun is gonna burn into a cinder Before we ever pass this wave again
[01:54:36.673 --> 01:54:53.623]  Yeah, make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, the devil close behind is definitely behind me.
[01:54:53.623 --> 01:54:57.426]  It's better than in front.
[01:54:57.426 --> 01:55:01.568]  He's born a loser.
[01:55:01.568 --> 01:55:04.590]  I wanted to hold Henry McHale over for one more segment.
[01:55:04.590 --> 01:55:06.211]  Really is a great rider and researcher.
[01:55:07.305 --> 01:55:16.449]  Uh, so that, uh, he's got a friend, uh, well, in a nutshell, tell us about the story, because I'm going to get him on later this week.
[01:55:16.449 --> 01:55:18.389]  We're talking about Kevin Annett.
[01:55:18.389 --> 01:55:31.915]  Um, uh, people were sending me emails, uh, about Kevin Annett, and I was kind of, I was ignoring them, especially an email about how mass graves have been found near Indian residential schools.
[01:55:31.915 --> 01:55:34.896]  And then I, um, finally watched Kevin Annett's, uh,
[01:55:35.817 --> 01:55:44.702]  It's an hour and a half, called Unrepentant, and I realized, oh my God, this man is on to something.
[01:55:44.702 --> 01:55:46.823]  Let me spell his name for your listeners.
[01:55:46.823 --> 01:55:49.644]  It's A-N-N-E-T-T.
[01:55:49.644 --> 01:55:51.005]  That's Kevin Annett.
[01:55:51.005 --> 01:55:52.806]  A-N-N-E-T-T.
[01:55:52.806 --> 01:56:03.332]  He was a United Church minister on Vancouver Island, a small logging community, and in the true Christian spirit, he opened up his services to
[01:56:05.197 --> 01:56:07.338]  A lot of natives.
[01:56:07.338 --> 01:56:09.499]  He presided over a lot of native funerals.
[01:56:09.499 --> 01:56:13.721]  He started asking questions about why people were dying.
[01:56:13.721 --> 01:56:19.063]  And he started hearing stories about what went on in the Indian residential schools.
[01:56:19.063 --> 01:56:27.487]  And he started digging out information that indicated that half of the students at these schools were dying.
[01:56:27.487 --> 01:56:29.368]  They were being exposed to viruses.
[01:56:29.368 --> 01:56:32.249]  They were being sterilized.
[01:56:32.249 --> 01:56:34.690]  They were being beaten and they were being sexually abused.
[01:56:35.598 --> 01:56:43.720]  And this is like a hidden holocaust right here in Canada.
[01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:45.741]  Most Canadians aren't aware of it.
[01:56:45.741 --> 01:56:55.983]  And essentially, he was kicked out of the United Church of Canada, which is the old Methodist Presbyterian Church that united.
[01:56:55.983 --> 01:56:59.784]  And he was kicked out, unceremoniously kicked out.
[01:56:59.784 --> 01:57:03.745]  And it wasn't so much for asking these questions and getting this information.
[01:57:04.249 --> 01:57:14.972]  He publicly opposed a land sale where the church sold land which they held in trust for the natives to a large logging company.
[01:57:14.972 --> 01:57:16.153]  Well, let me just say this in closing.
[01:57:16.153 --> 01:57:17.953]  We're going to get him on later this week.
[01:57:17.953 --> 01:57:20.634]  His story meshes with what's admitted.
[01:57:20.634 --> 01:57:26.196]  I mean, that's what they've always done to the natives, and it goes on right here in the U.S.
[01:57:26.196 --> 01:57:29.837]  We've had some of the tribal leaders on, and now they just do it to everybody.
[01:57:30.487 --> 01:57:34.591]  And again, the nurse giving you a shot, folks, doesn't know she's part of this.
[01:57:34.591 --> 01:57:35.472]  But God help us.
[01:57:35.472 --> 01:57:36.633]  And this goes to the cops, too.
[01:57:36.633 --> 01:57:38.434]  They're attacking you, too.
[01:57:38.434 --> 01:57:41.397]  And I know you want to roll your eyes and giggle and laugh and say it isn't happening.
[01:57:41.397 --> 01:57:41.937]  It is.
[01:57:41.937 --> 01:57:42.458]  It's admitted.
[01:57:42.458 --> 01:57:44.840]  It's in my film, Endgame.
[01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:46.361]  And heaven help us.
[01:57:46.361 --> 01:57:49.004]  These people running things are just unbelievable.
[01:57:49.004 --> 01:57:51.626]  And so he was just there witnessing them all being exterminated, huh?
[01:57:53.709 --> 01:57:58.753]  Well, he basically got the stories, because these schools were shut down, but they were never schools.
[01:57:58.753 --> 01:58:01.254]  They were more like concentration camps.
[01:58:01.254 --> 01:58:03.976]  The kids actually worked most of the time and were abused.
[01:58:03.976 --> 01:58:05.037]  There's very little schooling.
[01:58:05.037 --> 01:58:05.898]  Oh, no, I understand.
[01:58:05.898 --> 01:58:12.682]  They're using slave, and then they're there to be raped, they're to be jackbooted, and they're to be killed and tested on by bioweapons programs.
[01:58:12.682 --> 01:58:16.065]  We'll find out more about this particular case coming up this week.
[01:58:16.065 --> 01:58:17.506]  Doc, thanks for coming on.
[01:58:17.506 --> 01:58:19.567]  Henry McHale, Ph.D.
[01:58:19.567 --> 01:58:20.788]  SaveTheMales.ca.
[01:58:20.788 --> 01:58:22.569]  Appreciate you coming on.
[01:58:22.569 --> 01:58:23.030]  My pleasure.
[01:58:24.076 --> 01:58:25.717]  All right, we'll be right back in one minute.
[01:58:25.717 --> 01:58:27.779]  Cover some more news, then we've got another big guest coming up.
[01:58:27.779 --> 01:58:32.102]  Stay with us.
[01:58:32.102 --> 01:58:33.663]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:33.663 --> 01:58:41.688]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:41.688 --> 01:58:43.089]  It is a big idea.
[01:58:43.089 --> 01:58:45.931]  A new world order.
[01:58:45.931 --> 01:58:46.852]  In the near future.
[01:58:47.737 --> 01:58:50.798]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:58:50.798 --> 01:58:53.640]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:56.421]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:58:56.421 --> 01:58:59.602]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:58:59.602 --> 01:59:06.926]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:59:09.966 --> 01:59:15.390]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:59:15.390 --> 01:59:19.272]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:59:19.272 --> 01:59:21.834]  Bill of Regents is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:59:21.834 --> 01:59:23.015]  Most people have no idea.
[01:59:23.015 --> 01:59:23.795]  They're not after money.
[01:59:23.795 --> 01:59:25.056]  They have all the money they need.
[01:59:25.056 --> 01:59:26.057]  They're after power.
[01:59:26.057 --> 01:59:27.198]  That's what they're after these years.

[01:59:35.923 --> 01:59:38.725]  In Game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:59:38.725 --> 01:59:39.786]  You have been warned.
[01:59:43.875 --> 01:59:46.301]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:46.301 --> 01:59:49.047]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:55.609 --> 01:59:59.432]  If I came in your back door and broke my way in with a crowbar,
[02:00:26.113 --> 02:00:29.555]  And you caught me in your wallet stealing $800.
[02:00:29.555 --> 02:00:31.797]  Would you be angry with me?
[02:00:31.797 --> 02:00:36.520]  Well, you would be, uh, rightfully, uh, in your rights.
[02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:39.362]  You'd be correct to gun me down.
[02:00:39.362 --> 02:00:48.167]  To open fire with your pump shotgun until I was dead, and that would then stop home invasions, would scare criminals, and would protect your family.
[02:00:48.167 --> 02:00:50.368]  Back when we behaved like that, we had almost no crimes.
[02:00:50.368 --> 02:00:51.029]  People would kill you.
[02:00:52.799 --> 02:01:12.737]  But the government has been selling water districts, private water facilities, public water facilities, things we've paid for, to predominantly foreign companies, and they come in and overnight double, triple, quadruple, and we have examples of bills where the newspapers have reported on this, where they'll be 240-something bucks to 1,270-something bucks.
[02:01:12.737 --> 02:01:13.417]  I mean, boom, overnight.
[02:01:17.311 --> 02:01:22.515]  Your trash pickup gets cut from once a week, I mean from twice a week to once a week, and they double it.
[02:01:22.515 --> 02:01:23.896]  Then a year later, they double it again.
[02:01:23.896 --> 02:01:25.698]  That's a quadrupling.
[02:01:25.698 --> 02:01:30.501]  This is the new lawlessness, and we got a guest coming on scheduled in the next segment.
[02:01:30.501 --> 02:01:35.165]  In fact, let's just go ahead and get them lined up now.
[02:01:35.165 --> 02:01:43.451]  Some of the other news that I have here... Now, I see these probably four or five times a day.
[02:01:43.451 --> 02:01:45.713]  Major university, major government studies,
[02:01:46.625 --> 02:01:54.449]  Uh, they're just letting you know now, 30 years into cell phones, that, oh, by the way, most of you are going to be dying from brain tumors now.
[02:01:54.449 --> 02:01:57.431]  You know, if our shots don't kill you, this is.
[02:01:57.431 --> 02:02:03.454]  You tell the poor cops, when they told them 20 years ago, those radar guns were frying them, and they don't, they don't listen.
[02:02:03.454 --> 02:02:04.274]  Fine, don't listen.
[02:02:04.274 --> 02:02:05.955]  Just enjoy yourselves.
[02:02:05.955 --> 02:02:06.916]  Uh, warning!
[02:02:06.916 --> 02:02:10.978]  Using a mobile phone while pregnant can seriously damage your baby.
[02:02:11.895 --> 02:02:40.318]  Study of 13,000 children exposed link between use of headsets and later behavioral problems from brain development and they have studies, multiple studies, absolutely proving that brain development problems, heart problems, because they have electrochemical nerves in them that are very sensitive, ganglia in the heart that control that incredible muscle, that just being in the motorized incubators
[02:02:41.670 --> 02:02:46.712]  That the babies are actually better in the systems that don't have all of the magnetic fields.
[02:02:46.712 --> 02:02:54.774]  You ever notice when you get an AM radio next to a dishwasher and it picks up... That's because a wave is being thrown off.
[02:02:54.774 --> 02:02:57.395]  It gets all into radio technology, microwave technology.
[02:02:57.395 --> 02:03:06.598]  The point is that you stick a baby inside a box with hundreds of gyros and equipment and nozzles and things spinning and scanning, it fries them.
[02:03:07.421 --> 02:03:12.225]  Okay, now, now, the fields off that aren't as strong as a cell phone.
[02:03:12.225 --> 02:03:14.767]  And it just gets into all that, and it's hurting the kids bad.
[02:03:14.767 --> 02:03:16.809]  It's hurting all of us.
[02:03:16.809 --> 02:03:23.014]  And, uh, you know, I was looking at houses a few years ago, and it was a nice one, but it was like a hundred yards from a cell tower.
[02:03:23.014 --> 02:03:24.315]  I didn't live there.
[02:03:24.315 --> 02:03:25.236]  Looked at another house.
[02:03:25.236 --> 02:03:28.138]  It had high-powered lines about 50 yards away.
[02:03:28.138 --> 02:03:29.720]  I didn't move there.
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:33.863]  You know, you want the house, your wife wants it, you just, oh, it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:03:33.863 --> 02:03:34.744]  I'm gonna move into it.
[02:03:35.982 --> 02:03:38.022]  You need to stay away from RF, UHF.
[02:03:38.022 --> 02:03:41.023]  You need to stay away from microwave transmissions.
[02:03:41.023 --> 02:03:43.183]  You need to stay away from high-powered lines.
[02:03:43.183 --> 02:03:45.344]  Even if you care about yourself.
[02:03:45.344 --> 02:03:54.726]  I mean, the studies are... They knew back in the 40s with the radar dishes, where the troops would heat up their food, you know, on the back of the dish, and they found out it was frying them.
[02:03:54.726 --> 02:03:56.086]  They get sunburns from it.
[02:03:56.086 --> 02:03:57.466]  I know radio engineers.
[02:03:57.466 --> 02:04:02.007]  You go in there and AM transmitter for just 10 minutes, you get a sunburn.
[02:04:03.038 --> 02:04:05.540]  Okay, I'm going to explain to you, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:05.540 --> 02:04:07.621]  It's very bad for you.
[02:04:07.621 --> 02:04:11.164]  I know you can't see the waves, but they are there.
[02:04:11.164 --> 02:04:14.306]  They're just not visible to our light spectrum.
[02:04:14.306 --> 02:04:18.669]  They're in a different spectrum, a different wavelength.
[02:04:18.669 --> 02:04:20.270]  And that's your Daily Warning.
[02:04:20.270 --> 02:04:22.191]  It's a big report on The Independent.
[02:04:22.191 --> 02:04:25.894]  Got links to it up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:04:25.894 --> 02:04:27.074]  God help us.
[02:04:27.074 --> 02:04:29.656]  I've basically completely quit using my cell phone.
[02:04:29.656 --> 02:04:31.237]  I don't think I've checked the messages in two weeks.
[02:04:31.237 --> 02:04:32.098]  I don't even know where it is.
[02:04:33.450 --> 02:04:34.511]  I know it's out of batteries, actually.
[02:04:34.511 --> 02:04:35.552]  It's in my car.
[02:04:35.552 --> 02:04:36.612]  That's the new system.
[02:04:36.612 --> 02:04:37.753]  I'm just completely getting rid of it.
[02:04:37.753 --> 02:04:39.174]  I'm gonna throw the thing away, I think.
[02:04:39.174 --> 02:04:41.696]  Because if I have it, I'll just keep using it.
[02:04:41.696 --> 02:04:43.597]  But everybody's buying them for their kids.
[02:04:43.597 --> 02:04:44.578]  Crying their little brains.
[02:04:48.399 --> 02:04:51.241]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:04:51.241 --> 02:04:52.803]  Loose Change, Final Cut.

[02:05:34.941 --> 02:05:35.381]  Hi, neighbor.
[02:05:51.084 --> 02:05:53.224]  We all know that knowledge is power.
[02:05:53.224 --> 02:05:56.925]  We've tried to give you knowledge to help you prepare for rough times.
[02:05:56.925 --> 02:06:02.246]  There's the worldwide famine and our country's dependence on often dangerous food imports.
[02:06:02.246 --> 02:06:04.767]  You know about genetically poisoned food.
[02:06:04.767 --> 02:06:11.068]  Two-thirds of the food is disappearing with the bees along with huge crop failures from all-time record water shortages.
[02:06:11.068 --> 02:06:14.729]  You know they're turning food into fuel with corn ethanol plants.
[02:06:15.689 --> 02:06:19.911]  If we do not control our food, food will be used to control us.
[02:06:19.911 --> 02:06:25.754]  Food control has been the plan historically in every enslaved population and is the plan for America.
[02:06:25.754 --> 02:06:34.478]  The only value of the knowledge you have to take control of your food is if you choose to get a supply while you still have the freedom to choose.
[02:06:34.478 --> 02:06:35.759]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.

[02:07:38.804 --> 02:07:40.386]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:16.819 --> 02:08:23.682]  Alan Schnitto is our guest, and I really appreciate him coming on the show today.
[02:08:23.682 --> 02:08:26.483]  Thirst, Fighting the Corporate Theft of Our Water.
[02:08:26.483 --> 02:08:32.185]  There's a book, there's a film, and I have read excerpts of the book online.
[02:08:32.185 --> 02:08:33.446]  I've seen clips online of the film.
[02:08:34.353 --> 02:08:45.183]  Uh, it really fits in to, uh, really what I have researched myself, and the reason I'm saying that is this is an accurate book, an accurate film.
[02:08:45.183 --> 02:08:50.027]  In fact, it probably doesn't even scratch the surface of how bad it really is, though it will completely shock you.
[02:08:51.308 --> 02:09:04.298]  It is just mind-blowing that we pay for the water systems, we sit on top of the aquifers, that they're teaching us that water is a diminishing resource, and they're preparing us to pay more.
[02:09:04.298 --> 02:09:16.146]  It's artificial scarcity, and when a $240 bill goes up to $1,270, I mean, this is the type of stuff that's going on, and the raping is just intensifying.
[02:09:16.146 --> 02:09:17.647]  But look, we're Americans.
[02:09:17.647 --> 02:09:18.728]  We think we're free.
[02:09:18.728 --> 02:09:20.329]  We think it's the land of the free, home of the brave.
[02:09:21.266 --> 02:09:22.527]  And so we're taking advantage of.
[02:09:22.527 --> 02:09:27.231]  We pay on average five times what people in third world nations pay for prescription drugs.
[02:09:27.231 --> 02:09:29.613]  We pay about double what Europe does.
[02:09:29.613 --> 02:09:33.637]  About double what the Canadians pay.
[02:09:33.637 --> 02:09:36.239]  Though in many cases they have higher standards of living than us.
[02:09:36.239 --> 02:09:37.440]  We don't have the highest standard now.
[02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:40.002]  We just dropped to like number three.
[02:09:40.002 --> 02:09:42.784]  We pay the most for everything.
[02:09:42.784 --> 02:09:45.667]  Except for fuel, and that's now changing as the dollar devalues.
[02:09:46.860 --> 02:10:10.719]  uh... and uh... we are the most in prison the population where the most obese population where the most unhealthy population next to the russians uh... and uh... it is because multinational corporations know this is a happy hunting ground thirty million dumbed down self-important people so busy worshiping themselves in the mirror but they have no idea that corporate crooks are running absolutely rampant
[02:10:11.526 --> 02:10:23.957]  Now, the corporate crooks know we're starting to wake up, so they've written policy reports to militarize police, build more prisons, get ready to suppress free speech in case we don't like going into third-world-dom as we're now sliding down into it.
[02:10:23.957 --> 02:10:30.864]  So, we really appreciate our guest coming on with us today.
[02:10:30.864 --> 02:10:33.306]  And, Alan, I've never talked to you before.
[02:10:33.306 --> 02:10:34.667]  Am I pronouncing your last name right?
[02:10:35.892 --> 02:10:36.853]  Yes, thanks a lot.
[02:10:36.853 --> 02:10:37.673]  Thanks for having me.
[02:10:37.673 --> 02:10:37.993]  You bet.
[02:10:37.993 --> 02:10:38.814]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:10:38.814 --> 02:10:42.755]  Tell us, because you've been working on this for over a decade.
[02:10:42.755 --> 02:10:51.039]  When you first woke up to this scam, boil down the basics for us and then flesh out what their current looting is.
[02:10:51.039 --> 02:11:04.425]  Well, I'd say that when we first really woke up to things was that where we lived, my partner Deborah Kaufman and I in California, there was a company called Enron.
[02:11:05.990 --> 02:11:13.314]  That sort of took over and they deregulated the energy prices and the way that energy was controlled.
[02:11:13.314 --> 02:11:16.935]  And the problem with that was that, of course, the company just took us for a ride.
[02:11:16.935 --> 02:11:31.301]  About $9 billion was cycled out of people's pockets here in California and sent to their headquarters in Texas and to the headquarters of other major energy companies which were controlling the market.
[02:11:31.301 --> 02:11:34.703]  And what we found out when that crisis sort of exploded
[02:11:35.419 --> 02:11:46.325]  And Enron became a scandal about how it controlled prices, was that Enron had also had plans to become one of the biggest water companies in the world.
[02:11:46.325 --> 02:11:54.449]  They were buying up water resources in England, in Argentina, in California, and other parts of the country.
[02:11:54.449 --> 02:12:01.753]  And they were hoping to be able to do a bit with water what they had done with energy.
[02:12:01.753 --> 02:12:04.655]  Luckily, they went bankrupt before they could get there.
[02:12:05.290 --> 02:12:18.904]  But the idea of being able to take advantage of the one resource which is absolutely essential for human life, which has been in this country a public service,
[02:12:19.837 --> 02:12:23.598]  Uh, for, uh, all of the 20th and now into the 21st century.
[02:12:23.598 --> 02:12:33.380]  And by the way, in all of England, in all of England and most areas, it's still free because you pay your taxes and it's so inexpensive through the water system to send people water.
[02:12:33.380 --> 02:12:36.801]  Now they're about to start charging them there and they're shocked.
[02:12:36.801 --> 02:12:42.442]  Uh, so, so, so again, this is about raping us, uh, for something that we've already paid for many, many times.
[02:12:43.357 --> 02:13:01.004]  Well, and what's happened also recently is that back when the Clean Water Act was passed in the 1970s and the EPA was created, there was a lot of money put in by the federal government into cleaning up water.
[02:13:01.004 --> 02:13:10.887]  That was the era when the river that runs through Pittsburgh caught on fire because there was so much chemical pollution from industry in the river.
[02:13:10.887 --> 02:13:12.548]  Rivers were cleaned up
[02:13:13.004 --> 02:13:15.786]  Sewage treatment plants were modernized.
[02:13:15.786 --> 02:13:19.128]  Industrial water treatment plants were created.
[02:13:19.128 --> 02:13:28.395]  And what happened since then, however, in the last 15, 20 years has been there's a dramatic cutback in investment in infrastructure across the country.
[02:13:28.395 --> 02:13:33.899]  We're seeing that with highway bridges collapsing, a huge water main in New York City today.
[02:13:33.899 --> 02:13:36.201]  And the feds are saying, we're not going to give you money.
[02:13:36.201 --> 02:13:37.582]  The states aren't going to give you money.
[02:13:37.582 --> 02:13:39.063]  You've just got to... Wow!
[02:13:40.427 --> 02:13:42.589]  Sounds like a fire engine.
[02:13:42.589 --> 02:13:50.696]  You've got to trade in and hand in your water district that you pay for, that the people own, to this guy.
[02:13:50.696 --> 02:13:56.442]  And this guy comes in the first year cheap, but then three years later quadruples prices.
[02:13:56.442 --> 02:13:56.903]  Right.
[02:13:56.903 --> 02:14:02.448]  And that's been the offer that some private companies, these are multinationals,
[02:14:03.390 --> 02:14:12.416]  Two of them based in France, one based in Germany, have been saying that, well, what we can do is we can do it better, faster, cheaper.
[02:14:12.416 --> 02:14:20.081]  You don't like government anyway, especially you folks in the United States, so why don't you turn it over to the private sector?
[02:14:20.081 --> 02:14:22.803]  But let's be clear, though.
[02:14:22.803 --> 02:14:26.606]  They hire police forces, they gouge you, they just become the government.
[02:14:26.606 --> 02:14:27.626]  Go ahead.
[02:14:27.626 --> 02:14:31.529]  Well, I think that what we saw, for example, in Stockton, California,
[02:14:32.245 --> 02:14:51.993]  Was not so much that they hired police forces, but what they did do was they sort of got involved in the political process because there was an initiative that citizens groups, grassroots people, put on the ballot saying that you couldn't privatize our system without first putting it on the ballot.
[02:14:51.993 --> 02:14:58.696]  And you had these companies put in $70,000 in a small cities political initiative campaign
[02:14:59.184 --> 02:15:00.385]  In the space of a week or two.
[02:15:00.385 --> 02:15:15.775]  And that was really torquing, changing the quality of local politics when you've got a multinational company with enormous, unlimited resources, lawyers, campaign consultants, and so forth, getting involved in local political races and local campaigns.
[02:15:15.775 --> 02:15:19.277]  And that's a major problem that we're facing actually all over the country.
[02:15:19.277 --> 02:15:20.678]  And let me stop and throw this in.
[02:15:20.678 --> 02:15:22.879]  Yeah, we're the happy hunting ground.
[02:15:22.879 --> 02:15:24.040]  Not only are they doing that,
[02:15:25.234 --> 02:15:32.419]  But they even create subsidiaries that have a local name to be deceptive, correct?
[02:15:32.419 --> 02:15:38.845]  In many cases, yeah, they have lots of different names that they take.
[02:15:38.845 --> 02:15:50.915]  So that the big energy company in Germany, which owned a big water company in England, took over a big water company in the United States called American Water.
[02:15:51.724 --> 02:16:00.816]  And their subsidiaries are Pennsylvania American, you know, Indiana American, California American.
[02:16:00.816 --> 02:16:02.718]  And so that's the way they're known here.
[02:16:03.772 --> 02:16:16.155]  That's a normal kind of thing, but many people find out about this, they almost find out about it too late, and they start to fight out against it, and so one of the things that we've seen is that... Well, by the way, here they do have private police forces.
[02:16:16.155 --> 02:16:25.478]  Like, the LCRA is constantly in trouble, and it's just a completely lawless organization, but they have attack forces that they'll release on anyone they wish.
[02:16:25.478 --> 02:16:28.358]  SWAT teams, everything.
[02:16:28.358 --> 02:16:29.719]  Reign of Terror.
[02:16:31.584 --> 02:16:36.185]  That's a frightening possibility.
[02:16:36.185 --> 02:16:44.268]  In most places that we've seen, that remains somewhat contained on this waterfront.
[02:16:44.268 --> 02:16:46.948]  But it is getting scary because of climate change.
[02:16:46.948 --> 02:16:49.949]  There's now less water.
[02:16:49.949 --> 02:16:53.470]  Right where I live, there's now rationing that's going on.
[02:16:53.470 --> 02:16:55.091]  Not rationing, but cutbacks of 20%.
[02:16:56.741 --> 02:16:59.944]  Uh, if you, if you, uh... But see, Enron did that as a scam.
[02:16:59.944 --> 02:17:06.550]  We know that Secretary of the Army White, before that was working for him, he would bring them in, the legislature, into fake computer screens.
[02:17:06.550 --> 02:17:10.153]  They were real computer screens, but fake data showing them fake trading.
[02:17:10.153 --> 02:17:18.560]  Enron would just make up the number, and that was just a mob front to put money into the Kamens, and they just imploded it, and killed Lay, and got him out of the way.
[02:17:18.560 --> 02:17:22.083]  You know, or he had a heart attack, I'm sorry.
[02:17:22.083 --> 02:17:24.425]  Right after being convicted, and right before sentencing.
[02:17:25.521 --> 02:17:29.745]  I mean, really, remember they told you, oh, there's no energy, and it turned out there was plenty of energy.
[02:17:29.745 --> 02:17:31.866]  It was just part of raping the people.
[02:17:31.866 --> 02:17:34.528]  And I think it was more than 9 billion, wasn't it?
[02:17:34.528 --> 02:17:35.809]  All told in California?
[02:17:35.809 --> 02:17:39.332]  Oh, God, I don't know what the final total of this thing was.
[02:17:39.332 --> 02:17:41.934]  It was like 26 billion is the last number I saw.
[02:17:41.934 --> 02:17:43.135]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:17:43.135 --> 02:17:50.361]  Well, it's a... In this case, in terms of the scarcity in water, there are real problems.
[02:17:50.361 --> 02:17:51.182]  Although,
[02:17:52.252 --> 02:17:53.973]  There's plenty of water to go around.
[02:17:53.973 --> 02:17:56.433]  I mean, that's one of the ironies of this situation.
[02:17:56.433 --> 02:17:57.154]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:17:57.154 --> 02:18:06.636]  We waste water enormously, and the question is not paying a private company to take a profit off the top of that.
[02:18:06.636 --> 02:18:13.218]  Water is likely to get more expensive because we have to pay to clean it up, and we're polluting the water.
[02:18:13.218 --> 02:18:15.299]  So we have to stop polluting at the front end.
[02:18:15.299 --> 02:18:21.441]  If we weren't dumping as much stuff into the water as we are, then we would have somewhat of a less of a problem.
[02:18:21.843 --> 02:18:36.506]  But we're still going to have some problems in parts of the country, like here in California, because the temperatures are going up, and that means we have less snowpack, and that means we have less controllable water resources, and at times of the year it'll be tougher.
[02:18:36.506 --> 02:18:38.126]  We have to make it to people.
[02:18:38.126 --> 02:18:44.247]  It has been getting hotter in California, but now they say it looks like temperatures are going to start dropping.
[02:18:44.247 --> 02:18:46.308]  Well, you mean this spring?
[02:18:48.533 --> 02:18:51.635]  Well, just overall, NASA and others are saying the Earth was heating.
[02:18:51.635 --> 02:18:52.875]  Now they think it's going to start cooling.
[02:18:52.875 --> 02:18:53.536]  Oh, okay.
[02:18:53.536 --> 02:18:54.476]  I hadn't heard that.
[02:18:54.476 --> 02:18:56.077]  But who knows what's really going to happen.
[02:18:56.077 --> 02:18:57.858]  You know, the weather is always changing.
[02:18:57.858 --> 02:19:02.520]  Well, I mean, you guys, though, your film and book has really woke a lot of people up, I'm told.
[02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:04.261]  I mean, a lot of people talk about it.
[02:19:04.261 --> 02:19:07.763]  So, how are the multinationals trying to counter you?
[02:19:07.763 --> 02:19:09.644]  I want to talk about that when we get back, but go ahead and start.
[02:19:11.582 --> 02:19:15.725]  There's no major campaign against us.
[02:19:15.725 --> 02:19:16.505]  They know us.
[02:19:16.505 --> 02:19:20.707]  They try to respond to us when they have to.
[02:19:20.707 --> 02:19:24.169]  They try to ignore us when they can.
[02:19:24.169 --> 02:19:34.034]  But I think that the problem that they've already found is that there's been, even though you're a multinational corporation, you have to beam down into the local area.
[02:19:34.034 --> 02:19:37.136]  The local community can oppose their activities.
[02:19:37.136 --> 02:19:39.357]  They have to convince people in the local area that
[02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:41.741]  They should bring in these companies.
[02:19:41.741 --> 02:19:43.982]  And that is the obstacle.
[02:19:43.982 --> 02:19:44.822]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:19:44.822 --> 02:19:48.624]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:48.624 --> 02:19:56.567]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut.
[02:19:56.567 --> 02:20:01.749]  An entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:20:01.749 --> 02:20:05.591]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[02:20:05.931 --> 02:20:12.817]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[02:20:12.817 --> 02:20:16.240]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[02:20:16.240 --> 02:20:17.981]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[02:20:17.981 --> 02:20:24.127]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[02:21:20.531 --> 02:21:25.857]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[02:21:26.337 --> 02:21:28.699]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[02:21:28.699 --> 02:21:31.562]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.

[02:22:53.909 --> 02:22:57.411]  Martial Law is coming, but it's not going to arrive overnight.
[02:22:57.411 --> 02:22:59.392]  It's going to be incremental.
[02:22:59.392 --> 02:23:01.374]  This country is already teetering on the edge.
[02:23:01.374 --> 02:23:04.476]  Any incident, small or large, could trigger a total takeover.
[02:23:04.476 --> 02:23:05.937]  Anything could be the final push.

[02:23:46.357 --> 02:23:47.252]  At least for a minute!
[02:24:13.096 --> 02:24:27.701]  Alan Snitow is our guest, author of Thirst, Fighting the Corporate Theft of Our Water, the film Thirst, as well
[02:24:38.516 --> 02:24:45.719]  ...website, uh, snitto-koffman.org, or just Google Thirst the Film, Thirst the Book, you'll find it.
[02:24:45.719 --> 02:24:57.003]  Now, now, sir, I've actually studied this, and, and, and you really are, uh, very even-handed, because for me, it's even far worse than even what you're articulating, so I want to get into the real horror stories.
[02:24:57.003 --> 02:24:57.843]  I mean, I know this.
[02:24:57.843 --> 02:24:59.224]  It's in waste management and everything.
[02:24:59.224 --> 02:25:05.286]  They more than doubled the price of my trash pickup, I don't know, five, six years ago, and then cut it down to one pickup a week.
[02:25:06.187 --> 02:25:17.936]  Uh, when the local mob-connected company that's known all over the world in 60-minute specials for being mafia-run, Classic Wacosa Noster, came in, uh, we've had, uh, you know, the water go up and up and up.
[02:25:17.936 --> 02:25:21.519]  I mean, everything just being, I mean, it's probably three times what it was ten years ago.
[02:25:21.519 --> 02:25:23.981]  And we're sitting on top of an aquifer, huge lakes everywhere.
[02:25:23.981 --> 02:25:27.624]  It's just squeezing us in, and I see articles in the news
[02:25:29.156 --> 02:25:36.620]  I heard a talk show I was covering, Thirst, just last week, Gary Brownfield, he was reading news articles where he was talking about $200 bills going to $1,200 plus.
[02:25:36.620 --> 02:25:37.640]  I mean, can you get into that?
[02:25:37.640 --> 02:25:45.104]  Because that's, I mean, that's the proof of the pudding, is they come in and then just suddenly everything goes up by insane leaps and bounds.
[02:25:45.104 --> 02:25:46.404]  Obviously, we don't want this.
[02:25:46.404 --> 02:25:49.846]  I mean, where are these companies getting the money to come in and buy everything up?
[02:25:49.846 --> 02:25:51.307]  Why are our governments selling it?
[02:25:51.307 --> 02:25:52.187]  Can they sell it?
[02:25:52.187 --> 02:25:53.828]  It's our water facility.
[02:25:55.365 --> 02:26:10.528]  Well, what we're trying to alert people to in Thirst, the book and the movie, was that in recent years, and particularly most intensely under the Bush administration, you've had government cut back the amount of money
[02:26:11.229 --> 02:26:15.791]  From our taxes, that it invests in services that are for us.
[02:26:15.791 --> 02:26:18.172]  In effect, they are starving the beast.
[02:26:18.172 --> 02:26:20.293]  This is actually a term that they use.
[02:26:20.293 --> 02:26:22.113]  Starve the beast of government.
[02:26:22.113 --> 02:26:36.299]  And what they're actually doing is cutting the services that our taxes pay for in order to subsidize corporations, in order to push local governments and state governments into having to go to private companies in order to
[02:26:37.239 --> 02:27:00.691]  Carry out the services that used to be in the public trust and a public responsibility And that's a big problem for us because those companies come in especially with something like water water is a monopoly You only have one set of pipes underneath your ground going into your house And so in that situation you have no choice You have to get the water from that one source and what we've got to what we're what we're pointing out is is
[02:27:01.104 --> 02:27:05.025]  That there's no reason to have a private company come in and do this.
[02:27:05.025 --> 02:27:17.790]  What we've got to demand, and in fact they've found that more than 90% of Americans are in favor of more public funding, more federal funding and support of pure water resources.
[02:27:18.243 --> 02:27:28.968]  Because it's not just that there's enough water to go around, you have to be able to produce that water, you have to be able to clean it, you have to be able to, in order to drink it, and you also have to clean it at the other end.
[02:27:28.968 --> 02:27:32.790]  But here's the problem, the feds instead are mandating that you let the private
[02:27:33.382 --> 02:27:39.206]  Privateers, the letter of Mark, piratical individuals, take it over.
[02:27:39.206 --> 02:27:42.648]  So you can't go to Satan to cast out the devil.
[02:27:42.648 --> 02:27:46.671]  And as they say, you can't go to Beelzebub to get rid of Baphomet.
[02:27:46.671 --> 02:27:51.775]  Because we're looking at a system here where the feds are bought off by these very same institutions.
[02:27:51.775 --> 02:27:54.657]  I mean, this is the most fundamental thing is clean, good water.
[02:27:55.317 --> 02:28:01.383]  Instead of having CPS out kidnapping half the kids in the city, we should spend that money on having good water.
[02:28:01.383 --> 02:28:06.028]  And I've also just seen the ratios of corruption, the profits these companies are making.
[02:28:06.028 --> 02:28:07.109]  I mean, it's just a no-brainer.
[02:28:07.109 --> 02:28:10.352]  We don't want private companies owning our water, especially foreign ones.
[02:28:11.232 --> 02:28:12.413]  But then you've got a choice.
[02:28:12.413 --> 02:28:14.834]  You've got to have government be involved in it.
[02:28:14.834 --> 02:28:21.737]  You don't, you know, there's not... I can't go out and go to the local stream and produce clean water.
[02:28:21.737 --> 02:28:27.860]  So we have to, as a society, be able to have our water, our government, guarantee this.
[02:28:27.860 --> 02:28:31.761]  This is one of the basic... No, I understand, but you know what the feds are doing right now.
[02:28:31.761 --> 02:28:33.262]  They're doing the opposite of what you're saying.
[02:28:33.832 --> 02:28:38.217]  Well, I agree, and that is one of the reasons why the government's got to change.
[02:28:38.217 --> 02:28:42.521]  So that's, I mean, that's one of the key elements of what has been going on here.
[02:28:42.521 --> 02:28:49.168]  We've had the services that go to us, the things that are supposed to, the government is supposed to serve the people.
[02:28:49.168 --> 02:28:52.051]  It's supposed to be by and for the people.
[02:28:52.051 --> 02:28:55.594]  But what's happened is that it's become for the corporations.
[02:28:55.594 --> 02:28:56.876]  So it has to be taken back.
[02:28:57.532 --> 02:29:00.634]  And in taking it back, we can start to move things.
[02:29:00.634 --> 02:29:10.201]  We can start to change the way that multinational corporations are controlling the regulatory system, are raising prices, are taking over our local services.
[02:29:10.201 --> 02:29:12.323]  Why don't we take those services back?
[02:29:12.323 --> 02:29:15.445]  And we need to do that through our votes and through our government.
[02:29:18.308 --> 02:29:21.029]  All right, well, bottom line, we're being ripped off.
[02:29:21.029 --> 02:29:22.730]  We can argue about solutions all day.
[02:29:22.730 --> 02:29:23.930]  I don't see it getting any better.
[02:29:23.930 --> 02:29:29.793]  They're taking over the ports, waterways, roads, infrastructure, just grabbing and militarizing it.
[02:29:29.793 --> 02:29:35.575]  Private quasi-governmental hordes of armed troops running around, bombing at the mouth.
[02:29:35.575 --> 02:29:38.417]  Stay with us.
[02:29:38.417 --> 02:29:39.817]  We're on the march.
[02:29:39.817 --> 02:29:42.338]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:42.338 --> 02:29:45.039]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:48.755 --> 02:29:50.176]  It is a big idea.
[02:29:50.176 --> 02:29:52.997]  A New World Order.
[02:29:52.997 --> 02:29:57.518]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:29:57.518 --> 02:30:00.099]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:30:00.099 --> 02:30:03.501]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[02:30:03.501 --> 02:30:06.702]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:30:06.702 --> 02:30:14.005]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:30:17.043 --> 02:30:22.487]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:30:22.487 --> 02:30:26.369]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:30:26.369 --> 02:30:28.931]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:30:28.931 --> 02:30:30.092]  Most people have no idea.
[02:30:30.092 --> 02:30:30.872]  They're not after money.
[02:30:30.872 --> 02:30:32.153]  They have all the money they need.
[02:30:32.153 --> 02:30:33.134]  They're after power.
[02:30:33.134 --> 02:30:34.295]  That's what Africa needs here.

[02:31:47.173 --> 02:31:48.794]  Wake up, Protestant America!
[02:31:48.794 --> 02:31:52.456]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[02:31:52.456 --> 02:31:58.500]  This confederation of Evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting bloc.
[02:31:58.500 --> 02:32:02.582]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[02:32:02.582 --> 02:32:05.964]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom.
[02:32:06.184 --> 02:32:07.325]  Liberty of conscience.
[02:32:07.325 --> 02:32:11.990]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate.
[02:32:11.990 --> 02:32:16.053]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[02:32:16.053 --> 02:32:18.656]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[02:32:18.656 --> 02:32:23.961]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[02:32:23.961 --> 02:32:27.644]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[02:32:27.644 --> 02:32:30.227]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[02:32:30.407 --> 02:32:33.169]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late!
[02:32:33.169 --> 02:32:35.110]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling!
[02:32:35.110 --> 02:32:36.691]  Jesus is coming soon!

[02:33:03.196 --> 02:33:08.539]  I go back to it a lot because they run our planet.
[02:33:08.539 --> 02:33:12.822]  It's a window into what governs our lives.
[02:33:12.822 --> 02:33:25.571]  And I spent the time to read hundreds of pages of the IMF and World Bank documents that were released
[02:33:32.566 --> 02:33:51.221]  In March of 2002, when they talked about how they were going to take down third world countries, how they would come in and seize the water, when the nations didn't pay off their debts by design, they'd tell the politicians not to.
[02:33:54.113 --> 02:34:03.659]  Then they'd take over the water supply and triple the price overnight, cause riots, then the economy would implode, they'd consolidate that, and they talked about how they were coming in predatorily and buying up everything in the U.S.
[02:34:03.659 --> 02:34:06.120]  to control us.
[02:34:06.120 --> 02:34:19.448]  And now here we are, and we're talking to the writer, one of the writers, several writers with it, Michael Fox, Deborah Kaufman, and of course, Alan who we're talking to right now, Alan Sininto.
[02:34:20.582 --> 02:34:22.963]  Uh, made a film and wrote the book, Thirst.
[02:34:22.963 --> 02:34:24.323]  Film, Thirst, Book, Thirst.
[02:34:24.323 --> 02:34:28.984]  And you can go to the website, uh, snitow-koffman.org.
[02:34:28.984 --> 02:34:31.065]  We got a link on infowars.com.
[02:34:31.065 --> 02:34:36.626]  Snitow, uh, spelled S-N-I-T-O-W-dash-koffman.org.
[02:34:36.626 --> 02:34:38.607]  Uh, look, just run the gamut.
[02:34:38.607 --> 02:34:47.109]  Any other key points we should know, what their current scams are, uh, where they're moving in, what they're doing, uh, break that down for us.
[02:34:48.151 --> 02:35:09.415]  Okay, well one of the scams is that a lot of talk now is happening about bottled water companies coming in and bottling either local municipal water supplies or coming in and actually pumping from springs in particular areas.
[02:35:09.415 --> 02:35:11.116]  It's happening all over the country.
[02:35:11.116 --> 02:35:16.237]  Nestle is the big one, although they have local names like Deer Park and
[02:35:17.978 --> 02:35:18.419]  I don't know.
[02:35:32.742 --> 02:35:38.923]  Then, will we make the investments as a society that is necessary to keep our tap water clean?
[02:35:38.923 --> 02:35:41.283]  Because that's the big challenge.
[02:35:41.283 --> 02:35:57.366]  And bottled water is like an ideological offensive against the idea that we all deserve and have a right to clean water, and that it's our government's responsibility to make sure that that happens.
[02:35:57.366 --> 02:35:59.227]  So bottled water has been this trend.
[02:35:59.227 --> 02:36:00.067]  It's been a fad.
[02:36:00.067 --> 02:36:01.387]  It's grown very, very fast.
[02:36:02.206 --> 02:36:03.148]  I don't know.
[02:36:19.017 --> 02:36:22.220]  Of plastic that goes all into landfills.
[02:36:22.220 --> 02:36:23.161]  It's not recycled.
[02:36:23.161 --> 02:36:24.562]  It's just junk.
[02:36:24.562 --> 02:36:29.547]  And it takes an enormous amount of oil just to make the plastic bottles.
[02:36:29.547 --> 02:36:32.229]  And then the water is not more regulated.
[02:36:32.229 --> 02:36:35.813]  In fact, it's less regulated than what comes out of the tap.
[02:36:35.813 --> 02:36:37.995]  So you've got a real problem.
[02:36:37.995 --> 02:36:43.320]  And this is like an effort to say, drink our water that you're going to pay a thousand times more for.
[02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:44.100]  It's really a trick.
[02:36:45.709 --> 02:36:48.351]  And it's a sad one.
[02:36:48.351 --> 02:37:05.560]  We need to be able to make sure that the water that we have, the water that we get from our taps is clean water, and that people get tested the water if they're using well water, so that they can actually make sure that the water is clean, that they're drinking, because it is really the most essential part of our body.
[02:37:08.467 --> 02:37:09.548]  Well, it is.
[02:37:09.548 --> 02:37:24.937]  You know, I don't like what the feds are mandating and paying to have added to the water, and how they've forced local districts to put fluoride in their water, sodium fluoride, when we know that it's very toxic to the brain, and now a lot of the scientists and doctors that had pushed it earlier now admit they're wrong.
[02:37:24.937 --> 02:37:26.798]  What's your stance on them adding things?
[02:37:26.798 --> 02:37:31.261]  I mean, couldn't we medicate ourselves if we want sodium fluoride and think it's good for us?
[02:37:31.261 --> 02:37:32.442]  Couldn't we just take that ourselves?
[02:37:33.101 --> 02:37:36.183]  Well, fluoride is a local decision, it's not a federal one.
[02:37:36.183 --> 02:37:38.825]  Yeah, but they withhold money, water money.
[02:37:38.825 --> 02:37:40.066]  No, they don't.
[02:37:40.066 --> 02:37:44.229]  They don't hold, there are a lot of places that don't have fluoride in the water.
[02:37:44.229 --> 02:37:47.971]  No, I know, about 65% of the United States has it.
[02:37:47.971 --> 02:38:01.101]  I know the numbers, and I think you might be, I know you're a water expert, but basically, it's kind of like if Texas wanted its highway funds, it needed to put thumb scanners in in 93 and they did it.
[02:38:01.981 --> 02:38:15.770]  So, I don't want to get in an argument with you, but I know I have family that runs little water operations in towns and things that are still government, and they're basically told, you put this in or the state's not going to give you your federal funds that they got, and they're basically ordered to.
[02:38:15.770 --> 02:38:22.634]  Now, I understand it's not like it's a law, but I'm saying, look, they're pressured to put it in.
[02:38:22.634 --> 02:38:25.016]  Well, in the case, there are different ones.
[02:38:25.700 --> 02:38:32.663]  One is the case of chlorine and so forth that's put into water to kill germs.
[02:38:32.663 --> 02:38:33.903]  But that's what the towns tell them.
[02:38:33.903 --> 02:38:38.565]  They tell them this water is completely clean, it's out of an aquifer, the head of the water supply.
[02:38:38.565 --> 02:38:40.466]  We do not need chlorine in here.
[02:38:40.466 --> 02:38:46.568]  There's massive evidence of cancer in the bladder, in the kidneys, in the liver.
[02:38:46.568 --> 02:38:47.749]  And they just say, do it.
[02:38:47.749 --> 02:38:49.349]  We're ordering you to.
[02:38:49.349 --> 02:38:50.210]  But look.
[02:38:50.210 --> 02:38:53.671]  Well, the chlorine in tap water
[02:38:54.051 --> 02:39:00.015]  Water that goes through pipes, whether it comes from an aquifer or not, there are sometimes breaks in pipes and so on.
[02:39:00.015 --> 02:39:06.539]  That's the thing that ensures that the water that gets to you has not been infiltrated with any bacteria.
[02:39:06.539 --> 02:39:13.284]  And chlorine is the single greatest public health move that was ever made in history.
[02:39:13.775 --> 02:39:18.639]  Because people used to get cholera and so forth from their water supply.
[02:39:18.639 --> 02:39:24.865]  No, I fully understand that sanitation and indoor plumbing is the key to civilization.
[02:39:24.865 --> 02:39:31.210]  I'm just saying sodium fluoride, and we can have a debate about that, is really bad.
[02:39:31.210 --> 02:39:37.496]  I know that the level of chlorine in the Austin supply is as high as it is in a swimming pool, and a fish dies when it swims in there.
[02:39:38.617 --> 02:39:42.821]  So I'm just saying we're drinking that and boy I wish there were reasons to reduce it.
[02:39:42.821 --> 02:39:45.423]  I don't think people should drink tap water.
[02:39:45.423 --> 02:39:48.625]  I agree that a lot of the bottled water is a scam and even dirtier than the water.
[02:39:48.625 --> 02:39:52.889]  There have been studies that it's killed people before it's been infected with stuff.
[02:39:52.889 --> 02:40:01.956]  My point is that I think we should all filter our water because most water supplies have a Prozac, Ritalin, female hormones.
[02:40:01.956 --> 02:40:02.837]  I'm sure you've heard about that.
[02:40:06.343 --> 02:40:18.428]  I think that, you know, other than like filtering for the taste, I think that you can have pretty good sense of what your local water supply is providing you.
[02:40:18.428 --> 02:40:27.491]  The amount of the pharmaceuticals that have recently been a lot of publicity about is a kind of horizon problem that has to be dealt with.
[02:40:27.491 --> 02:40:28.091]  But you know what?
[02:40:28.091 --> 02:40:34.854]  The way it has to be dealt with is we're going to have to modernize our treatment plants so that sewage treatment plants take it out.
[02:40:35.365 --> 02:40:38.267]  And that drinking water treatment plants take it out.
[02:40:38.267 --> 02:40:40.910]  And that's the way it's going to have to happen.
[02:40:40.910 --> 02:40:58.043]  Because tap water is extremely reliable, but we're not keeping up with the threat because industry and agriculture are putting more and more in new mixtures of chemicals, whether it's pharmaceuticals, whether it's atrazine that's put on corn, and corn has been expanding enormously.
[02:40:58.043 --> 02:41:01.186]  Oh yeah, the herbicides, the pesticides, that's the biggin'.
[02:41:01.186 --> 02:41:03.868]  That's a huge, these are huge challenges.
[02:41:04.645 --> 02:41:17.687]  And unless we modernize all these systems, and there are a lot of jobs involved in modernizing these systems, this is the kind of investment that we should be doing in this country in order to be able to keep things going.
[02:41:17.687 --> 02:41:18.728]  Actual jobs?
[02:41:18.728 --> 02:41:19.348]  Actual jobs.
[02:41:19.348 --> 02:41:21.868]  That aren't prison guards?
[02:41:21.868 --> 02:41:24.689]  We could have hundreds of thousands of jobs.
[02:41:24.689 --> 02:41:32.030]  We've got pipes that are 100, 150 years old that are still active in a lot of cities and a lot of towns across the country.
[02:41:32.611 --> 02:41:37.574]  We need to replace those pipes, and there's a lot of work involved in doing that.
[02:41:37.574 --> 02:41:41.156]  We need to modernize a lot of the plant equipment, a lot of the highways.
[02:41:41.156 --> 02:41:47.279]  There's an enormous amount in which we're letting this country's basic infrastructure fall apart.
[02:41:47.279 --> 02:42:00.287]  And that is an investment which actually produces the kind of jobs that are high-paying jobs, that are decent jobs, that people can have in this country at a time when unemployment is rising, and when we've got a problem with bridges falling in Minneapolis.
[02:42:00.748 --> 02:42:04.709]  We've got all kinds of infrastructure problems.
[02:42:04.709 --> 02:42:05.629]  Why don't we address them?
[02:42:05.629 --> 02:42:16.311]  That's where our economy has to go, to address what's real, rather than providing a small group of people with a couple of multinational corporations that want to have a corner on the water market.
[02:42:16.311 --> 02:42:20.632]  Those people are the ones who want to raise the prices and not deal with the infrastructure.
[02:42:20.632 --> 02:42:27.174]  And exactly, they're not even upgrading, they're just pirating and jacking up the price and sucking off a decaying system.
[02:42:27.174 --> 02:42:28.954]  They even admitted it in a
[02:42:29.722 --> 02:42:34.887]  It's a German company that controls one of the biggest water companies in the United States.
[02:42:34.887 --> 02:42:42.555]  They had a board meeting saying, we'd better get out of the water business because there's so much opposition to our coming in, number one, on the local level.
[02:42:42.555 --> 02:42:52.425]  But number two, they also said, wow, there's so much money we have to put in, but it's not worth it for us because we can't make a quick killing on water as we had expected.
[02:42:53.052 --> 02:42:55.314]  And that is the truth.
[02:42:55.314 --> 02:43:10.045]  They have their work cut out for them if they get into water because we can't deal without water and we're going to insist that they or anyone else who does water, including our own government, provide it and provide it at a decent price and make sure that it's clean.
[02:43:10.045 --> 02:43:11.526]  We have to insist on those things.
[02:43:11.526 --> 02:43:14.809]  We can't get along without it.
[02:43:14.809 --> 02:43:16.971]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:43:16.971 --> 02:43:17.391]  I'm glad.
[02:43:18.385 --> 02:43:30.811]  No, I agree with you that we've got a serious problem and a lot of scams that are going on, and we need to have a public debate about this, and not just let the privateers come in, because this is not privatization, this is not free market.
[02:43:30.811 --> 02:43:41.636]  It'd be free market if they came in and paid proper market price, agreed that they weren't going to gouge, offered a lot of things, which they don't, and it's just a bad idea.
[02:43:41.636 --> 02:43:45.338]  I mean, I'm for a free market system, but if we've already invested
[02:43:46.087 --> 02:43:47.790]  Already paid.
[02:43:47.790 --> 02:43:58.927]  It's been proven that especially local community things, I'm not for government at the federal level in any size or shape or form like it is now, but locally it really does work.
[02:43:59.887 --> 02:44:06.789]  Well, I agree with you on the free market system, but one of the things that I've always heard about a free market system is that generally it's about competition.
[02:44:29.052 --> 02:44:31.894]  You've got to have a competition in the marketplace.
[02:44:31.894 --> 02:44:38.279]  And one of the things that happens when you're dealing with your water and the pipes is that there isn't any competition.
[02:44:38.279 --> 02:44:40.220]  So it's a whole different kind of situation.
[02:44:40.220 --> 02:44:44.283]  Once you give up control of your water supply, you have nowhere else to go.
[02:44:44.283 --> 02:44:46.925]  So that is one of the big problems.
[02:44:46.925 --> 02:44:52.209]  In terms of water price increases, there's a town not far from where I live
[02:44:52.986 --> 02:45:05.869]  Where over the last year or two they came in with a, this German company took over, and they've come in with demanding more than a hundred percent increase over the last couple of years.
[02:45:06.591 --> 02:45:23.444]  And this has happened in other parts of the country as well, and some local governments have actually said, we want to take our water systems back because, first of all, providing water for people is not a money loser for local government.
[02:45:24.579 --> 02:45:28.581]  And it is a basic service that should be provided by local government.
[02:45:28.581 --> 02:45:32.102]  And these guys, the corporations, are one, charging more.
[02:45:32.102 --> 02:45:34.743]  They're constantly demanding new investment.
[02:45:34.743 --> 02:45:39.024]  They say that they're going to put in private money, their own money, but in fact they don't.
[02:45:39.024 --> 02:45:43.345]  They say, oh well, now we're running the system, why don't you put more money in?
[02:45:43.345 --> 02:45:45.386]  Because we need these changes.
[02:45:45.386 --> 02:45:48.207]  And finally, in Stockton, for example, and this has happened elsewhere,
[02:45:48.923 --> 02:45:50.924]  They ran the system to fail.
[02:45:50.924 --> 02:45:53.665]  It's called run to fail.
[02:45:53.665 --> 02:46:17.675]  Rather than replace pipes and replace equipment proactively, so that things would not fall apart, they actually delayed and waited until things would fall apart, because then they could say, well, they've gotten every bit out of a piece of equipment, rather than just saying, well, we can't afford, because this is a public service.
[02:46:18.035 --> 02:46:19.336]  So, I mean, what's their big goal?
[02:46:19.336 --> 02:46:22.558]  I mean, what propaganda are the private water profiteers pushing right now?
[02:46:44.505 --> 02:46:46.466]  Their propaganda remains the same.
[02:46:46.466 --> 02:46:53.889]  They're saying that private company, because it's in the free market supposedly, can be more efficient.
[02:46:53.889 --> 02:46:55.770]  That government is inefficient.
[02:46:55.770 --> 02:46:59.952]  That government employees don't work well.
[02:46:59.952 --> 02:47:04.954]  That they should have a quote-unquote partnership with government to deliver water.
[02:47:05.695 --> 02:47:16.376]  Uh, and, uh, that they will take over control and management of your local water supply, of your wastewater system, and, uh, these are the lines that they have constantly brought forward.
[02:47:16.986 --> 02:47:26.208]  More and more local governments are finding, and once they fell into these kind of ideas, because they've got so much tight budgets now in local areas.
[02:47:26.208 --> 02:47:31.350]  We're having, you know, real crunches in local budgets and state budgets.
[02:47:31.350 --> 02:47:38.631]  The result of that is that you have mayors saying, we've got to be able to get services out of our budget.
[02:47:38.631 --> 02:47:42.412]  Why don't we sell it off to a private company?
[02:47:42.412 --> 02:47:44.973]  And that is the wrong way to go.
[02:47:45.758 --> 02:47:46.359]  Absolutely.
[02:47:46.359 --> 02:47:49.941]  Listen, I really appreciate you coming on and spending time with us.
[02:47:49.941 --> 02:47:52.323]  Folks can find out more.
[02:47:52.323 --> 02:47:53.683]  Which website should they visit?
[02:47:53.683 --> 02:47:59.788]  The easiest one to remember is thirstthemovie.org.
[02:47:59.788 --> 02:48:02.830]  Thirstthemovie.org.
[02:48:02.830 --> 02:48:07.052]  And that has both our book and our movie there.
[02:48:07.052 --> 02:48:09.094]  How you can get them.
[02:48:09.094 --> 02:48:09.414]  Okay.
[02:48:09.414 --> 02:48:11.235]  A lot more information.
[02:48:11.235 --> 02:48:14.417]  I appreciate all the time you've given us and keep up the good work.
[02:48:14.417 --> 02:48:15.158]  Thank you very much.
[02:48:15.876 --> 02:48:16.817]  Take care.
[02:48:16.817 --> 02:48:23.081]  Folks, you may not be too into your water, but you're just taking for granted that it comes out of the pipe at your house.
[02:48:23.081 --> 02:48:29.206]  But this is what affects us, and this is the type of basic infrastructure we're being cheated on.
[02:48:29.206 --> 02:48:30.327]  But let me be clear.
[02:48:30.327 --> 02:48:34.750]  It's not just private corporations that double and triple prices.
[02:48:34.750 --> 02:48:43.617]  And I've seen examples of that in news, where, like I said, the $240-something a bill, and then a year later it's $1,200-something for the same amount of water.
[02:48:43.617 --> 02:48:45.258]  The governments are doing this, too.
[02:48:46.093 --> 02:48:51.062]  Uh, governments are jacking up prices anywhere they have a monopoly.
[02:48:51.062 --> 02:48:54.248]  And government has a monopoly on forcing your city, they have a monopoly on everything.
[02:48:55.207 --> 02:48:59.409]  But the super abuses we're seeing when government teams up with private corporations.
[02:48:59.409 --> 02:49:06.033]  And around here, I mean, you'll have, you know, the former mayor's wife on the board of the water company.
[02:49:06.033 --> 02:49:12.216]  And you'll have the guy on the Campo board handing over the roads to private companies to put toll roads on existing roads.
[02:49:12.216 --> 02:49:15.858]  And his daughter and son will work for the toll road company.
[02:49:15.858 --> 02:49:17.279]  I mean, getting hundreds of grand.
[02:49:17.279 --> 02:49:21.801]  I mean, it's just lawlessness, completely lawless.
[02:49:21.801 --> 02:49:23.522]  And the economy's going bankrupt.
[02:49:24.372 --> 02:49:26.393]  Look, a great example is Enron.
[02:49:26.393 --> 02:49:29.114]  They stole hundreds of billions nationwide and worldwide.
[02:49:29.114 --> 02:49:37.098]  They stole 20-plus billion when it collapsed out of California in one year, jacking up electricity prices.
[02:49:37.098 --> 02:49:45.462]  And they even had the, uh, they would turn the power off, and it later came out in documents, to create the perceived image that the power really wasn't there.
[02:49:45.462 --> 02:49:48.804]  Then people would accept three times, four times, five times the price.
[02:49:49.642 --> 02:49:50.883]  That's in the IMF documents.
[02:49:50.883 --> 02:49:56.246]  They say, you turn the water, you turn the electricity off, because then they'll accept anything.
[02:49:56.246 --> 02:50:01.249]  You know, they've got it, like with the gas shortage, they've now declassified, they staged in the late 70s.
[02:50:01.249 --> 02:50:02.810]  They had plenty of oil.
[02:50:02.810 --> 02:50:14.776]  But before they could raise it and bring it from 45 cents a gallon to a dollar a gallon, double the price, they had to shut it down and then order their facilities not to ship the oil.
[02:50:14.776 --> 02:50:15.517]  There was plenty of oil.
[02:50:15.993 --> 02:50:17.374]  We've had oil execs on.
[02:50:17.374 --> 02:50:19.636]  I had family that worked, you know, for oil companies there.
[02:50:19.636 --> 02:50:20.577]  They saw it.
[02:50:20.577 --> 02:50:22.819]  The barges, they were full of oil.
[02:50:22.819 --> 02:50:28.103]  They create that perceived need, that perceived scarcity.
[02:50:28.103 --> 02:50:32.967]  And they're doing it now, and it's all collapsing.
[02:50:32.967 --> 02:50:36.330]  I mean, they've hired all these millions of cops, and now the economy's falling apart.
[02:50:36.330 --> 02:50:38.572]  They're just gonna squeeze tighter to get their money.
[02:50:39.444 --> 02:50:42.548]  And, uh, it's gonna get a lot worse before it gets better.
[02:50:42.548 --> 02:50:47.915]  Alright, a ton of news, more guests coming up, really hardcore info, so you'll want to stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:47.915 --> 02:50:48.916]  But I wanted to cover water.
[02:50:48.916 --> 02:50:51.399]  It is a big idea.
[02:50:51.399 --> 02:50:52.400]  A new world order.
[02:50:53.146 --> 02:50:58.028]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:50:58.028 --> 02:51:00.869]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:51:00.869 --> 02:51:03.649]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:51:03.649 --> 02:51:06.830]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:51:06.830 --> 02:51:14.153]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:51:17.185 --> 02:51:22.629]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:51:22.629 --> 02:51:26.511]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:51:26.511 --> 02:51:29.073]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:51:29.073 --> 02:51:30.234]  Most people have no idea.
[02:51:30.234 --> 02:51:31.014]  They're not after money.
[02:51:31.014 --> 02:51:32.295]  They have all the money they need.
[02:51:32.295 --> 02:51:33.276]  They're after power.
[02:51:33.276 --> 02:51:34.437]  That's what they're after.
[02:51:34.437 --> 02:51:39.180]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:51:39.180 --> 02:51:43.162]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:51:43.162 --> 02:51:45.944]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:51:45.944 --> 02:51:47.005]  You have been warned.
[02:51:48.005 --> 02:51:48.826]  Hey Emily!
[02:51:48.826 --> 02:51:49.906]  Wow, you look great!
[02:51:49.906 --> 02:51:50.967]  I feel great!
[02:51:50.967 --> 02:51:53.028]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[02:51:53.028 --> 02:51:53.568]  Really?
[02:51:53.568 --> 02:51:54.188]  What is it?
[02:51:54.188 --> 02:51:54.849]  How does it work?
[02:51:54.849 --> 02:52:01.592]  MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[02:52:01.592 --> 02:52:04.073]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[02:52:04.073 --> 02:52:09.396]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you!
[02:52:09.736 --> 02:52:10.497]  That's it?
[02:52:10.497 --> 02:52:12.278]  It sounds so easy and convenient.
[02:52:12.278 --> 02:52:13.198]  It is easy.
[02:52:13.198 --> 02:52:20.183]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[02:52:20.183 --> 02:52:22.004]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[02:52:22.004 --> 02:52:23.145]  That's amazing!
[02:52:23.145 --> 02:52:28.489]  And, the bentonite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[02:52:28.769 --> 02:52:29.330]  Wow!
[02:52:29.330 --> 02:52:30.732]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[02:52:30.732 --> 02:52:33.655]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[02:52:33.655 --> 02:52:36.999]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.
[02:52:36.999 --> 02:52:40.584]  For only $22.95 plus shipping, MediCleanse is shipped directly to you.
[02:52:40.584 --> 02:52:41.325]  Or call them at 1-800-317-9547.
[02:52:41.325 --> 02:52:41.585]  That's 1-800-317-9547.
[02:52:41.585 --> 02:52:42.026]  Call today.
[02:52:48.305 --> 02:52:52.086]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[02:52:52.086 --> 02:52:56.788]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[02:52:56.788 --> 02:53:02.090]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[02:53:02.090 --> 02:53:13.314]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[02:53:13.314 --> 02:53:15.675]  Protecta Engine Treatment not only reduces friction,
[02:53:16.075 --> 02:53:18.115]  But it extends the life of your engine.
[02:53:18.115 --> 02:53:19.036]  Let's face it.
[02:53:19.036 --> 02:53:21.876]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[02:53:21.876 --> 02:53:29.878]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free.
[02:53:29.878 --> 02:53:32.178]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:53:32.178 --> 02:53:35.299]  That number again is 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:53:35.299 --> 02:53:39.360]  Or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[02:53:39.360 --> 02:53:41.540]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.
[02:53:41.540 --> 02:53:43.901]  Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:53:44.381 --> 02:53:45.822]  And it's safe for all cars.
[02:53:45.822 --> 02:53:51.224]  Act now.
[02:53:51.224 --> 02:54:08.671]  I hear the train a-comin' I hear the train a-comin' It's rollin' around the bend And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when I'm stuck in Folsom Prison And time keeps And time keeps draggin' on But that train keeps a-movin'
[02:54:13.156 --> 02:54:14.317]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:14.317 --> 02:54:26.387]  Yeah, I just found out during the break, Variety reporting, George Clooney has optioned the book, The Men Who Stare at Goats.
[02:54:26.387 --> 02:54:38.738]  So I got to get John Ronson on the show, and I got to get General Stubblebine, the commander of the men that stared at goats, and all the mind control, all the psychic warfare powers at Fort Bragg.
[02:54:40.423 --> 02:55:06.527]  uh... that they had in the seventies eighties nineties now and uh... he wrote a book about that and it was a best-seller including a cans is gonna make that his next big movie with george clooney i guess playing stubble by we gotta get stubble by on his own on a couple times with us what a character of the point is is what the government's into uh... and the sold out is very very interesting to say the least uh... but that that's just a weird tidbit i thought i'd tell you about
[02:55:07.338 --> 02:55:17.405]  There's lots of news like that that is weird and kind of fits into what we cover here, but like some guy who spent 20 years inventing something that's like out of G.I.
[02:55:17.405 --> 02:55:34.837]  Joe Cobra Commander, where they've got a Y-Wing, kind of like, kind of like, you know, the people that jump off clips with those, you know, those hang gliders, but it's a hard fixed wing deal with four huge
[02:55:35.706 --> 02:55:38.267]  Well, they're not that big, but they're big compared to the person.
[02:55:38.267 --> 02:55:39.268]  Engines.
[02:55:39.268 --> 02:55:48.852]  And there he is just flying around like something out of a movie in the mountainous air above mountains like something out of a science fiction movie.
[02:55:48.852 --> 02:55:51.113]  But it's 2008, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:51.113 --> 02:55:53.514]  I don't just mean a jetpack.
[02:55:53.514 --> 02:55:55.414]  I'd rather talk about stuff like that all day.
[02:55:55.414 --> 02:56:01.157]  By the way, we're going to go live at PrisonPlanet.tv here in just a couple minutes.
[02:56:05.445 --> 02:56:09.228]  And we are going to be opening the phones up in the next hour and 30 minutes.
[02:56:09.228 --> 02:56:15.592]  We're going to have We Are Change Ohio and We Are Change Kentucky on.
[02:56:15.592 --> 02:56:16.232]  They went in.
[02:56:16.232 --> 02:56:17.593]  They had official press passes.
[02:56:17.593 --> 02:56:21.055]  They asked Oliver North about the concentration camp program.
[02:56:21.055 --> 02:56:26.039]  And they, when they were walking out, jumped on one guy from behind, grabbing his camera, tackled him.
[02:56:26.883 --> 02:56:36.088]  And then said we're going to charge you with felonies for withholding evidence because you somehow having memory chips in their cameras was withholding evidence.
[02:56:36.088 --> 02:56:43.292]  So they stole the memory chips, stole the batteries, took them outside, screamed at them for 45 minutes like drill sergeants.
[02:56:43.292 --> 02:56:48.074]  I mean, this is the press being attacked, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:48.074 --> 02:56:51.356]  I got so mad about it yesterday on air when we had Adam
[02:56:52.509 --> 02:56:53.530]  On from We Are Change Kentucky.
[02:56:53.530 --> 02:56:55.051]  I want to get him on and the other guys.
[02:56:55.051 --> 02:56:56.592]  We've been able to get a hold of Adam.
[02:56:56.592 --> 02:56:58.634]  I have the numbers for the other guys.
[02:56:58.634 --> 02:57:01.976]  Guys, if you're out there, call into the network because I'm trying.
[02:57:01.976 --> 02:57:04.698]  I want to get you guys on for the last 30 minutes of the show.
[02:57:04.698 --> 02:57:08.581]  We got Adam coming on, but I heard him last night after I interviewed Adam.
[02:57:08.581 --> 02:57:12.043]  I heard him on another show and I drove around in the car and it was unbelievable.
[02:57:12.043 --> 02:57:14.405]  It was even worse than what Adam was saying.
[02:57:14.405 --> 02:57:19.288]  And it was very credible how they were telling their story and there's photos of them up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:57:20.723 --> 02:57:26.527]  Uh, all tore up, uh, 9-11 blogger has it too, you know, cut from it.
[02:57:26.527 --> 02:57:30.830]  And, uh, what they did, I mean, it's just, and Oliver North posing as a conservative.
[02:57:30.830 --> 02:57:33.852]  I mean, these people make me sick.
[02:57:33.852 --> 02:57:35.833]  They really make me sick.
[02:57:35.833 --> 02:57:42.178]  And, uh, WeAreChange assaulted by police in Louisville.
[02:57:42.178 --> 02:57:44.920]  Oliver North confronted, video footage confiscated.
[02:57:44.920 --> 02:57:48.142]  Members of WeAreChange, this is from WeAreChange.org, actually has the story.
[02:57:48.962 --> 02:57:55.784]  We're physically removed from Louisville Exposition Center on Sunday after confronting Iran contrafigure Oliver North.
[02:57:55.784 --> 02:58:03.246]  Members questioned North on his involvement with Continental government in the new 9-11 investigation and concealment camps in America.
[02:58:03.246 --> 02:58:10.729]  Lieutenant Oliver North, a Fox News host, was confronted by a combination of actors from We Are Change Ohio, Kentucky Change.
[02:58:10.729 --> 02:58:14.490]  Cody Deeds stood up during the question and answer session and asked him about
[02:58:15.194 --> 02:58:16.115]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:38.567 --> 02:58:40.528]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:58:40.528 --> 02:58:44.150]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:58:44.150 --> 02:58:46.252]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:58:46.252 --> 02:58:49.634]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:58:49.634 --> 02:58:55.377]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.

[02:59:41.186 --> 02:59:43.569]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:43.569 --> 02:59:46.331]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:11.715 --> 03:00:16.658]  We're going to be talking to We Are Change Kentucky, We Are Change Ohio.
[03:00:16.658 --> 03:00:24.683]  Later in the shower, they were assaulted by private security guns and police at the NRA convention in Louisville, Kentucky.
[03:00:24.683 --> 03:00:26.564]  They peacefully went to the event.
[03:00:26.564 --> 03:00:29.086]  They had accredited press passes they got.
[03:00:29.086 --> 03:00:34.669]  When they asked Oliver North about continuity of government, I'm going to play some of that video later, came out in Congress.
[03:00:34.669 --> 03:00:40.112]  Their plan to put Americans in concentration camps, which is now mainstream news, repackaged, brought out.
[03:00:40.112 --> 03:00:41.293]  More news on that today.
[03:00:42.231 --> 03:01:05.611]  They told them to leave, and as they were leaving, they tackled one guy in the back, and stole their camera equipment, stole their digital recording chips, and then threatened to charge them all with felonies, saying that something about having computer chips and cameras was absconding with federal evidence, and they were all going to prison for the rest of their lives, and then they just screamed at them and laughed at them for 45 minutes.
[03:01:06.972 --> 03:01:14.434]  And that's what our country's turned into, just a land of humiliation, a land of cowardice, a land of degeneracy.
[03:01:14.434 --> 03:01:28.478]  I have another big story here out of the New York Times today, and I want to spend more time on this and take your calls on this issue and on some other issues as well.
[03:01:28.478 --> 03:01:35.480]  And this just says that people turn in their children, grandchildren, parents for money, the most petty of crimes, marijuana, you name it,
[03:01:36.112 --> 03:01:38.575]  And they just call up wanting $100, $500.
[03:01:38.575 --> 03:01:41.018]  They say, you know, my son's smoking pot.
[03:01:41.018 --> 03:01:41.838]  I need $500.
[03:01:41.838 --> 03:01:45.142]  And they go, all right, we're coming.
[03:01:45.142 --> 03:01:46.424]  And it says it's good.
[03:01:46.424 --> 03:01:50.868]  The article's about how good this is and how the people are finally being good Americans.
[03:01:50.868 --> 03:01:52.490]  And you can't make this up.
[03:01:52.490 --> 03:01:53.331]  You can't make up.
[03:01:53.331 --> 03:01:56.615]  We are the most slovenly, degenerate, wicked people on earth.
[03:01:57.398 --> 03:01:58.379]  Now, a lot of us are good.
[03:01:58.379 --> 03:01:59.699]  I'm saying, by and large.
[03:01:59.699 --> 03:02:10.906]  It's like you have a barrel of apples, and, you know, 60% of the apples are filled with worms, and there's a bunch of cow manure dumped on top of it, and then a bucket of ticks.
[03:02:10.906 --> 03:02:12.967]  You don't eat apples out of any of that.
[03:02:12.967 --> 03:02:15.148]  I mean, are there 40% good apples?
[03:02:15.148 --> 03:02:20.391]  Yes, but the worms are now eating into those, and soon there won't be any apples left.
[03:02:20.391 --> 03:02:24.874]  It'll just be a big mush of worms and ticks, and, I mean, that's really what we are.
[03:02:26.104 --> 03:02:39.849]  And it's a country where cowards like Oliver North that hate this country and helped ship in narcotics, as the CIA's own Solicitor General reported to Congress, and who helped run death squads, is hailed as a conservative.
[03:02:39.849 --> 03:02:46.072]  As his conservative god, George Bush opens the border, triples the size of the BATF, destroys the dollar, destroys our name.
[03:02:46.072 --> 03:02:50.033]  And of course, Oliver North is nothing but a complete coward and a puppet and a fake conservative.
[03:02:50.033 --> 03:02:53.855]  I mean, he's not even worth a mention, other than the fact that he had his goons
[03:02:54.702 --> 03:02:56.443]  Violate the First Amendment rights of U.S.
[03:02:56.443 --> 03:03:01.784]  citizens, and it's one thing to do that in Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Colombia.
[03:03:01.784 --> 03:03:11.907]  It's another thing to do that in the U.S., and now they have Mexican cartels run by the CIA murdering police in the U.S., murdering the other drug cartels that haven't paid their cuts.
[03:03:11.907 --> 03:03:15.228]  As the people that run our government, the Criminal Crimes Syndicate consolidates its power.
[03:03:15.228 --> 03:03:19.069]  Our government's running these hits and running these operations.
[03:03:20.058 --> 03:03:21.720]  And, uh, I'm just tired of it.
[03:03:21.720 --> 03:03:22.160]  I'm tired.
[03:03:22.160 --> 03:03:23.581]  I mean, look, it's simple.
[03:03:23.581 --> 03:03:31.127]  The big banks that own our country, they decided, why don't we just take over the U.S.?
[03:03:31.127 --> 03:03:32.028]  Why don't we just run it?
[03:03:32.028 --> 03:03:35.451]  Why don't we triple charge people for their water and triple charge for their trash pickup?
[03:03:35.451 --> 03:03:39.053]  And why don't we arrest people and give them 10 years in prison for speeding now?
[03:03:39.053 --> 03:03:40.695]  Or arrest you for not having a seatbelt?
[03:03:40.695 --> 03:03:43.257]  Or arrest you for not having a turn signal on?
[03:03:43.257 --> 03:03:45.679]  Or, why don't we train your children to tattle on you?
[03:03:45.679 --> 03:03:48.381]  Or, or, or, or, or, you know, why don't we just take everything over?
[03:03:49.421 --> 03:03:51.743]  And they said, okay, let's do it.
[03:03:51.743 --> 03:03:52.843]  And they've done it.
[03:03:52.843 --> 03:03:56.526]  And they bring the drugs in and they put your young people in prison making widgets.
[03:03:56.526 --> 03:03:59.347]  And then the idiot population says, oh, make them prisoners work.
[03:03:59.347 --> 03:04:00.268]  They're lazy.
[03:04:00.268 --> 03:04:05.131]  What you don't know is, is that those prisoners then compete against you.
[03:04:05.131 --> 03:04:06.112]  Those prisoners then take
[03:04:07.387 --> 03:04:09.127]  Your jobs.
[03:04:09.127 --> 03:04:10.548]  Because they're working for 20 cents an hour.
[03:04:10.548 --> 03:04:12.008]  How are you going to compete with that?
[03:04:12.008 --> 03:04:13.969]  The illegal will work for 5 bucks an hour.
[03:04:13.969 --> 03:04:16.209]  The prisoner works for 20 cents an hour on average.
[03:04:16.209 --> 03:04:17.269]  What's going to happen to your job?
[03:04:17.269 --> 03:04:18.750]  What's going to happen to your economy?
[03:04:18.750 --> 03:04:21.030]  What's going to happen to your country?
[03:04:21.030 --> 03:04:28.552]  But up on WeAreChange.org and InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, you can look at the story, We Are Change Assaulted by Police in Louisville.
[03:04:29.583 --> 03:04:33.367]  And, uh, it just lets you know another nail in the coffin as the U.S.
[03:04:33.367 --> 03:04:41.055]  sinks under the ocean of third-world despotism and becomes a banana boat republic with a hyper-techno police-state overlay.
[03:04:41.055 --> 03:04:45.779]  Couldn't be a worse, uh, thing happenin'.
[03:04:45.779 --> 03:04:47.181]  It is a big idea.
[03:04:47.181 --> 03:04:50.945]  A new world order in the near future.
[03:04:51.815 --> 03:04:54.476]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:04:54.476 --> 03:04:57.716]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:04:57.716 --> 03:05:00.497]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:05:00.497 --> 03:05:03.678]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:05:03.678 --> 03:05:10.999]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:05:14.036 --> 03:05:19.480]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:05:19.480 --> 03:05:23.362]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:05:23.362 --> 03:05:25.924]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:05:25.924 --> 03:05:27.085]  Most people have no idea.
[03:05:27.085 --> 03:05:27.865]  They're not after money.
[03:05:27.865 --> 03:05:29.146]  They have all the money they need.
[03:05:29.146 --> 03:05:30.127]  They're after power.
[03:05:30.127 --> 03:05:31.268]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[03:07:44.946 --> 03:07:50.350]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:50.350 --> 03:08:03.581]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:03.581 --> 03:08:05.142]  We are Change, Ohio!
[03:08:10.444 --> 03:08:17.451]  Had press passes, were accredited, got up during the question and answer for Oliver North, and asked about continuity of government.
[03:08:19.403 --> 03:08:20.303]  And they asked politely.
[03:08:20.303 --> 03:08:23.785]  It's been reported by three of them we've talked to.
[03:08:23.785 --> 03:08:28.528]  And then they were followed because, you know, I mean, imagine all these cops are trained to fight terror.
[03:08:28.528 --> 03:08:36.011]  They've been taught in all their manuals and training that anybody that talks about FEMA camps or martial law, even though they're being trained for it, is a terrorist.
[03:08:36.011 --> 03:08:44.135]  And so they tackle them, grab the cameras, freak out, talk about how they're going to set them up, how they're going in for felonies for videotaping stuff.
[03:08:44.135 --> 03:08:44.596]  I mean, you know,
[03:08:45.236 --> 03:08:51.320]  There's no real terrorists, but they all watch 24 and think they're Jack Bauer, so the press is now Al Qaeda.
[03:08:51.320 --> 03:08:54.403]  It's like they'll kill you in Mexico if you report on government drug dealing.
[03:08:54.403 --> 03:08:57.205]  They're starting to kill reporters here and kill cops here.
[03:08:57.205 --> 03:09:02.569]  AP reports, they've told our cops, work for us or you die, and our cops are saying, we work for you.
[03:09:02.569 --> 03:09:05.291]  It's a nation run by fear and cowardice.
[03:09:05.291 --> 03:09:09.814]  And the death squads are run by the CIA, and they, as we told you three years ago, and it's now mainstream news.
[03:09:11.331 --> 03:09:18.193]  The media acts like, oh, the death squads our government trained, they're now operating in Texas and Indiana and all, they're killing people.
[03:09:18.193 --> 03:09:20.254]  Oh my God, our government doesn't control them.
[03:09:20.254 --> 03:09:22.114]  They trained them and now they're out of control.
[03:09:22.114 --> 03:09:24.635]  They've always controlled them.
[03:09:24.635 --> 03:09:27.736]  And now it's time for us to be third world slaves.
[03:09:27.736 --> 03:09:35.918]  But I thought I would go ahead and go to the document cam so I can show people
[03:09:39.002 --> 03:09:39.982]  What's going on here?
[03:09:39.982 --> 03:09:43.383]  Oh, I was gonna show them a video, but I don't even have my controller in here.
[03:09:43.383 --> 03:09:44.664]  I gotta get that switcher in here.
[03:09:44.664 --> 03:09:45.824]  This isn't working.
[03:09:45.824 --> 03:09:47.025]  I don't know where the controller is.
[03:09:47.025 --> 03:09:52.246]  I wanted to show people this video for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers that are out there.
[03:09:52.246 --> 03:09:53.707]  And I don't have the little switcher.
[03:09:53.707 --> 03:09:55.568]  Oh, here it is.
[03:09:55.568 --> 03:09:57.648]  Why should I even show people this stuff with North?
[03:09:57.648 --> 03:09:58.569]  They don't even care.
[03:09:58.569 --> 03:09:59.089]  Just don't.
[03:09:59.089 --> 03:10:00.949]  Look, you're all gonna get it, okay?
[03:10:00.949 --> 03:10:02.210]  All of you that like the system.
[03:10:02.210 --> 03:10:04.230]  All of you that think it's real funny.
[03:10:04.230 --> 03:10:08.172]  Here's the video of it from my film, Police Day 2, The Takeover.
[03:10:08.172 --> 03:10:08.492]  Okay?
[03:10:09.645 --> 03:10:11.387]  There it is.
[03:10:11.387 --> 03:10:22.236]  Colonel North, in your work at the NSC, were you not assigned at one time to work on plans for the continuity of government in the event of a major disaster?
[03:10:22.236 --> 03:10:36.828]  Mr. Chairman, I believe that question touches upon a highly sensitive and classified area, so may I request that you not touch upon that, sir.
[03:10:38.368 --> 03:11:04.405]  I was particularly concerned, Chairman, because I read in Miami Papers and several others that there had been a plan developed by that same agency, a contingency plan in the event of an emergency that would suspend the American Constitution, and I was deeply concerned about it and wondered if that was the area in which he had worked.
[03:11:06.399 --> 03:11:13.322]  May I most respectfully request that that matter not be touched upon at this stage.
[03:11:13.322 --> 03:11:17.624]  We wish to get into this on certain arrangements can be made for an executive session.
[03:11:19.009 --> 03:11:25.354]  And tragically, the only member who got close was Jack Brooks, and he was stopped by the chairman.
[03:11:25.354 --> 03:11:48.392]  But the truth of the matter is that, yes, you do have those standby provisions, and the plans are there, and the statutory emergency plans are there, whereby you could, in the name of stopping terrorism, apprehend, invoke the military, and arrest Americans, and hold them in detention camps.
[03:11:50.826 --> 03:12:01.269]  Okay, you can just type in Oliver North, FEMA Camps, and look, if I sound mad on air, I'm not mad at the people of the network or anybody here, I'm mad.
[03:12:01.269 --> 03:12:04.770]  I mean, it makes me sick looking at Oliver North.
[03:12:04.770 --> 03:12:12.673]  I mean, you know, this fake American, this fake Marine, this fake patriot, all they're doing is killing the country.
[03:12:12.673 --> 03:12:19.975]  Something Hitler couldn't do, something Stalin couldn't do, something Mao couldn't do, and they wrap themselves in the flag while they do it.
[03:12:20.723 --> 03:12:28.169]  They scientifically manipulate you and have these things like war stories and associate themselves with Audie Murphy and other heroes.
[03:12:28.169 --> 03:12:30.791]  It's disgusting.
[03:12:30.791 --> 03:12:34.894]  It's disgusting to watch them get away with this over and over again.
[03:12:34.894 --> 03:12:37.335]  And they're just taking the whole country, they're taking the whole thing down.
[03:12:37.335 --> 03:12:50.045]  I mean this, this tore my guts out this morning when I read this story out of the New York Times.
[03:12:52.648 --> 03:12:58.710]  Where they're just happily reporting.
[03:12:58.710 --> 03:13:03.271]  It's up on the document cam for folks that are watching online right now.
[03:13:03.271 --> 03:13:08.333]  As prices rise, crime tipsters work overtime.
[03:13:08.333 --> 03:13:11.054]  That's right, that's their job, it says.
[03:13:11.054 --> 03:13:14.695]  And yeah, I mean, I told the story just last week about
[03:13:16.287 --> 03:13:29.635]  One of the famous cases, and I always use cases that are well-known, there's literally thousands I've seen until I see it now in a newspaper and I get sad, I get upset, I get anxious, my heart starts beating because I want justice to be done.
[03:13:29.635 --> 03:13:31.115]  I want bad guys to go to jail.
[03:13:31.115 --> 03:13:33.216]  I can't believe we're in this much trouble.
[03:13:33.216 --> 03:13:37.619]  It's like we're just going deeper and deeper down a black hole I know we're not coming out of.
[03:13:37.619 --> 03:13:43.062]  About the, you know, the guy in North Carolina that owned a couple of nurseries for plants
[03:13:43.792 --> 03:14:04.017]  And every year he went to Texas, to Houston, to buy Yopans that were going to be shipped by 18-wheeler, but they gave him a discount if he paid cash, and he had $14,000, and he happened to whip some cash out to pay at the airport, and the woman, it said, was making 30-something grand a year, but she made 200 grand a year in getting a percentage of the seizures.
[03:14:04.017 --> 03:14:12.059]  No drugs found, no criminal record, and they just took his money, and he never got it back, and the courts just said, it doesn't matter if you don't have drugs, we're going to take it.
[03:14:12.873 --> 03:14:13.973]  And they don't stop, folks.
[03:14:13.973 --> 03:14:26.336]  I mean, there's famous cases of the DPS in Texas pulling over an 80-something-year-old woman who carried around $4,000 cash with her, as most old-time women would carry a lot of money around with them back from the Depression days.
[03:14:26.336 --> 03:14:29.617]  Turned out she was heiress to some oil baron, hundreds of millions.
[03:14:29.617 --> 03:14:33.178]  But, hey, pull her over, brand-new Cadillac, come over to her car.
[03:14:33.178 --> 03:14:34.298]  They say, mind if we search?
[03:14:34.298 --> 03:14:35.999]  She says, okay, officer.
[03:14:35.999 --> 03:14:39.019]  They get the, what, three, four grand in her wallet, and they just take it.
[03:14:39.019 --> 03:14:41.120]  I mean, that's what America is, folks.
[03:14:41.120 --> 03:14:41.680]  They'll come in,
[03:14:42.998 --> 03:14:52.973]  All the time when they raid people for guns that aren't even illegal, they go ahead and take your gold, bust you in your safe, they just put it right in their pockets right in front of you.
[03:14:52.973 --> 03:14:54.676]  And it's admitted.
[03:14:54.676 --> 03:14:58.662]  I mean, I can sit here for a thousand hours reading mainstream news articles about police
[03:14:59.762 --> 03:15:23.233]  Selling each other drugs to seize bars and restaurants that they then own and run or Stealing people's houses planting drugs on them or stealing your land and killing you hell a lot of times if they decide they want your ranch They'll just cops will come right out and kill you and then use it as their deer hunting ranch I mean, they'll just walk you out back and line you up and boom blow the back of your head right off and I mean, you know, I mean, it's the most criminal group there is out there and
[03:15:23.931 --> 03:15:27.613]  Now, that's the higher-up cops in certain corrupt divisions.
[03:15:27.613 --> 03:15:33.937]  The average cop's just out writing tickets and following orders, and they're not corrupt.
[03:15:33.937 --> 03:15:39.581]  And they're just out raising money and writing tickets to hire more cops.
[03:15:39.581 --> 03:15:40.802]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[03:15:40.802 --> 03:15:43.043]  I mean, I really can't.
[03:15:43.043 --> 03:15:44.784]  I want to take your calls.
[03:15:44.784 --> 03:15:50.068]  I know I've got a bunch of you that are holding John and Chris and Mark and a bunch of other people.
[03:15:52.333 --> 03:15:54.274]  Is this land of the free, home of the brave?
[03:15:54.274 --> 03:15:56.434]  I mean, is this what our country's all about?
[03:15:56.434 --> 03:16:02.176]  As prices rise, crime temperatures work overtime.
[03:16:02.176 --> 03:16:11.558]  To gas prices, foreclosure rates, and the cost of rice, add this rising cost indicator, the number of tips to the police from people hoping to collect reward money.
[03:16:13.112 --> 03:16:19.817]  Calls to the Southwest Florida Crime Stoppers Hotline in the first quarter of the year were up 30% over last year.
[03:16:19.817 --> 03:16:22.298]  San Antonio had a 44% increase.
[03:16:22.298 --> 03:16:36.328]  Cities and towns from Detroit to Omaha to Beaufort, North Carolina, all report increases of 25% or more in the first quarter, with tipsters telling operators they need the money for rent, light bills, and baby formula.
[03:16:37.088 --> 03:16:39.190]  Biggest part of our economy is prisons.
[03:16:39.190 --> 03:16:40.731]  After that, it's military.
[03:16:40.731 --> 03:16:41.971]  After that, it's surveillance.
[03:16:41.971 --> 03:16:43.573]  I mean, that's what we are.
[03:16:43.573 --> 03:16:50.918]  We are the most evil, wicked, pathetic, degenerate, scum-filled nation of trash.
[03:16:50.918 --> 03:16:52.679]  And I'm not even talking about the police or the government.
[03:16:52.679 --> 03:16:57.002]  I mean, the general public are just mindless, gibbering monkeys.
[03:16:57.002 --> 03:16:58.183]  And let me tell you something.
[03:16:58.183 --> 03:17:05.628]  They set off nukes and then tell the gibbering population to put Americans in camps and that they'll get their milk and honey back, they'll do it.
[03:17:06.548 --> 03:17:14.771]  If you don't think that the Great Depression, 90% of us, or 85, lived on farms that could feed ourselves, and thousands starved.
[03:17:14.771 --> 03:17:16.452]  Millions went hungry.
[03:17:16.452 --> 03:17:19.233]  Right now, 5% can take care of themselves.
[03:17:19.233 --> 03:17:23.915]  They're going to be demonic animals like you've never seen.
[03:17:23.915 --> 03:17:26.496]  Okay?
[03:17:26.496 --> 03:17:27.176]  Oh, God.
[03:17:27.176 --> 03:17:27.596]  Oh, God.
[03:17:27.596 --> 03:17:28.177]  Roving.
[03:17:28.177 --> 03:17:32.358]  We're going to make Mexico look like heaven in this country.
[03:17:32.358 --> 03:17:36.240]  If you're not going to fight, if you're not going to stand and fight for the country and try to turn it around, you should evacuate.
[03:17:36.704 --> 03:17:42.669]  Not that other countries are good, it's just that this is the land of scum.
[03:17:42.669 --> 03:17:48.113]  Continuing, calls to the Southwest Crime Stoppers hotline in the first quarter.
[03:17:48.113 --> 03:17:49.334]  Went up 30%, already read that.
[03:17:50.273 --> 03:17:54.736]  For this year, everyone that's called has pretty much been looking for money, said Sgt.
[03:17:54.736 --> 03:18:04.442]  Lawrence Beller, who answers Crimestoppers calls, you mean snitch Soviet Death of America systems, at the Sussex County, New Jersey Sheriff's Office.
[03:18:04.442 --> 03:18:11.727]  That's as opposed to the last couple of years where people were just sick of crime and wanted to do something about it.
[03:18:11.727 --> 03:18:19.632]  As a result, many programs report a substantial increase in Crimestopper-related arrest and recovering property as callers turn in their neighbors,
[03:18:20.669 --> 03:18:27.111]  Grandchildren and former boyfriends in exchange for a little cash.
[03:18:27.111 --> 03:18:28.212]  See, their instinct's gone.
[03:18:28.212 --> 03:18:30.253]  It's not that I'm even that good of a person.
[03:18:30.253 --> 03:18:33.414]  I don't tattle on people because I know it's a crime.
[03:18:33.414 --> 03:18:34.334]  I know it's wicked.
[03:18:34.334 --> 03:18:38.716]  I know it contributes to a tattletale, scum society.
[03:18:38.716 --> 03:18:41.517]  I mean, it's not even training that makes me never tattle on anybody.
[03:18:41.517 --> 03:18:42.357]  I can't do it.
[03:18:44.002 --> 03:18:51.550]  I mean, I would physically put a mask on and beat somebody over the head with a baseball bat before I'd call Johnny Law to do something to him, and not that I would do that, but you know what I mean.
[03:18:51.550 --> 03:18:53.612]  I mean, I'll do it myself.
[03:18:53.612 --> 03:19:02.862]  On Friday, a woman called the Regional Crime Stoppers line in Macon, Georgia, to find out when she could pick up her reward money for a recent tip.
[03:19:02.862 --> 03:19:05.685]  She was irritated to learn that she would have to wait until Monday.
[03:19:07.262 --> 03:19:09.625]  See, the government loves to train you to do this.
[03:19:09.625 --> 03:19:14.451]  I mean, it's one thing to let people call and tattle, but you should never get rewards.
[03:19:14.451 --> 03:19:17.515]  And see, it started for bank robbers and killers, and ooh, very rare.
[03:19:17.515 --> 03:19:18.977]  Now it's for everything.
[03:19:18.977 --> 03:19:22.382]  Just, and it's just slopping hogs.
[03:19:24.634 --> 03:19:26.716]  I'm in a bind, I really need it.
[03:19:26.716 --> 03:19:29.378]  I'm in a bind, she told the hotline operator.
[03:19:29.378 --> 03:19:33.421]  There's a lot of stuff I know, but I didn't open my mouth.
[03:19:33.421 --> 03:19:45.851]  If I weren't in a bind, I wouldn't open my mouth, because I'm a white trash scum.
[03:19:45.851 --> 03:19:47.273]  It is a big idea.
[03:19:47.273 --> 03:19:50.115]  A new world order.
[03:19:50.115 --> 03:19:50.996]  In the near future.
[03:19:51.897 --> 03:19:54.980]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:19:54.980 --> 03:19:57.803]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:19:57.803 --> 03:20:00.586]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[03:20:00.586 --> 03:20:03.789]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:20:03.789 --> 03:20:11.097]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:20:14.119 --> 03:20:19.562]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:20:19.562 --> 03:20:23.443]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:20:23.443 --> 03:20:26.005]  Bill Burdick is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:20:26.005 --> 03:20:27.165]  Most people have no idea.
[03:20:27.165 --> 03:20:27.945]  They're not after money.
[03:20:27.945 --> 03:20:29.226]  They have all the money they need.
[03:20:29.226 --> 03:20:30.206]  They're after power.
[03:20:30.206 --> 03:20:31.367]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[03:23:57.535 --> 03:24:08.539]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913 made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to a hundred and three.
[03:24:08.539 --> 03:24:13.821]  A hundred and three is forever when you're just a little kid.
[03:24:13.821 --> 03:24:18.962]  So, Cyrus Jones lived forever.
[03:24:18.962 --> 03:24:25.865]  Gravedigger, when you dig my grave, would you make it shallow?
[03:24:27.975 --> 03:24:30.857]  Look, we've had it too good too long.
[03:24:56.011 --> 03:25:03.496]  And that's why we're gonna be slaves.
[03:25:03.496 --> 03:25:05.557]  We're gonna get hurt.
[03:25:05.557 --> 03:25:08.358]  Real bad.
[03:25:08.358 --> 03:25:11.240]  But they're good at scientifically doing it.
[03:25:11.240 --> 03:25:13.782]  To one person here, a couple there.
[03:25:13.782 --> 03:25:17.604]  Take this person's child, taser this person.
[03:25:17.604 --> 03:25:21.466]  Hit you with soft kill bioweapons and the vaccines that kill you slow.
[03:25:21.466 --> 03:25:22.467]  Kick him down the road.
[03:25:24.588 --> 03:25:28.870]  But I guess Willie Nelson's right.
[03:25:28.870 --> 03:25:35.893]  In the end, we all fall down anyways.
[03:25:35.893 --> 03:25:45.417]  We all fall down.
[03:25:45.417 --> 03:25:49.239]  Gravedigger.
[03:25:49.239 --> 03:25:51.079]  John in Ohio, then Chris, Mark, and others.
[03:25:52.642 --> 03:25:54.003]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[03:25:54.003 --> 03:26:06.909]  Alex, before I get to my working against this privatization in my local city here, you know me as someone who's an unaffiliated free thinker who agrees with the Marxist-Socialist analysis.
[03:26:06.909 --> 03:26:19.555]  But I think that in certain ways, we've got, you know, my original exposure to a Marxist-Socialist analysis was way back in the 60s and 70s with the Progressive Labor Party, PLP.
[03:26:20.513 --> 03:26:21.114]  We're good to go.
[03:26:35.905 --> 03:26:39.286]  They were the ones that first introduced me to false flag terrorism.
[03:26:39.286 --> 03:26:43.568]  They were the ones that introduced me to Operation Gladio way back in the 70s.
[03:26:43.568 --> 03:26:47.590]  I know, but you'll never listen that the globalists funded communism in their own documents.
[03:26:47.590 --> 03:26:51.471]  It's just impossible for you to just deny all those facts and just say it isn't true.
[03:26:51.471 --> 03:26:53.312]  So fine, believe what you want, John.
[03:26:53.312 --> 03:27:03.916]  Well, the point I've just made, I think, I'll speak for themselves that, you know, there's a clear... Yeah, but the communists did false flag events too, John.
[03:27:04.502 --> 03:27:16.954]  The point I'm making here is everything you've said along the point of eugenics has been in long monographs I've seen in PLP way back in the 60s and 70s and that's why I agree with 60% of what you're saying and I disagree with 40%.
[03:27:16.954 --> 03:27:21.518]  I think you're doing great work there but I think in many ways you're contradictory because
[03:27:22.106 --> 03:27:30.372]  For instance, when you had David J. Smith on criticizing Chavez, and by implication, even Morales.
[03:27:30.372 --> 03:27:32.433]  Well, let's get one thing straight.
[03:27:32.433 --> 03:27:35.115]  Hey John, John, hold on a minute.
[03:27:35.115 --> 03:27:42.540]  Number one, this is not some monolithic show, and I don't agree completely with every guest I have on.
[03:27:42.540 --> 03:27:45.402]  Just like I don't completely agree with a lot of things you're saying.
[03:27:45.402 --> 03:27:47.824]  I mean, a lot of these other shows are monolithic.
[03:27:48.348 --> 03:27:50.609]  Then it's all just one view or one idea.
[03:27:50.609 --> 03:27:53.311]  We're having a large college debate here.
[03:27:53.311 --> 03:27:54.091]  Go ahead.
[03:27:54.091 --> 03:28:01.575]  Okay, what I'm just saying, though, is that this kind of knee-jerk piggybacking on generations of anti-communist corporate propaganda
[03:28:02.119 --> 03:28:05.463]  ...leads us into actually opposing the very things we support.
[03:28:05.463 --> 03:28:17.399]  For instance, even Morales in Bolivia actually opposed the privatization of the water after there was a revolutionary upheaval because the peasants and the workers down there couldn't even live because of what was going on.
[03:28:17.399 --> 03:28:18.180]  No, I understand.
[03:28:18.180 --> 03:28:18.941]  I understand that.
[03:28:19.657 --> 03:28:25.883]  I understand that communism is, quote, the solution in Latin America to a lot of the wrongs of neo-feudalism.
[03:28:25.883 --> 03:28:30.608]  But, you know, that's kind of like saying the cure for cyanide is arsenic.
[03:28:30.608 --> 03:28:32.490]  And look, I appreciate your call, John.
[03:28:32.490 --> 03:28:40.398]  I mean, you never address Carol Quigley and the documents and Lord Milner and the fact that they funded the communists to destroy the czar.
[03:28:42.066 --> 03:28:46.407]  And that's just a fact, and so I don't believe it's a communist conspiracy.
[03:28:46.407 --> 03:28:55.489]  I believe communism is one tool, like radical Islam, the Wahhabists are created by the British Intel, just like all these major groups are.
[03:28:55.489 --> 03:29:04.430]  It's called the Great Game, and that's what Carol Quigley writes about, and that's really their corporate documents, that's their corporate history, their record.
[03:29:04.430 --> 03:29:07.411]  And so we're... Look, I reject your left-right paradigm.
[03:29:08.812 --> 03:29:19.080]  Just because I criticize what you know as the right-wing fascist structure, doesn't mean that I then embrace the other wing of the same bird of prey, the left wing.
[03:29:19.080 --> 03:29:20.401]  I reject it all.
[03:29:20.401 --> 03:29:25.124]  It's part of a false paradigm, a false political template.
[03:29:25.124 --> 03:29:32.189]  Before the bankers put out their disinfo 120 years ago, and then it became dominant in the last 80, people knew it as liberty versus tyranny.
[03:29:32.189 --> 03:29:32.810]  I'm for liberty.
[03:29:32.810 --> 03:29:34.091]  Period.
[03:29:35.646 --> 03:29:39.577]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:39.577 --> 03:29:42.265]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:45.908 --> 03:29:47.889]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:29:47.889 --> 03:29:54.851]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[03:29:54.851 --> 03:30:03.253]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:30:03.253 --> 03:30:08.975]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:30:09.155 --> 03:30:10.996]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:30:10.996 --> 03:30:13.297]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:30:13.297 --> 03:30:17.718]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:30:17.718 --> 03:30:19.939]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[03:30:19.939 --> 03:30:27.682]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[03:30:45.259 --> 03:30:50.622]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity theft each year.
[03:30:50.622 --> 03:30:56.645]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an average of $8,000.
[03:30:56.645 --> 03:31:03.469]  If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication, and often the only protection between a hacker and your personal information.
[03:31:03.789 --> 03:31:12.792]  Passwords that are stored in a spreadsheet, text file, data file, or any other file that is not encrypted and password protected are vulnerable to malicious theft and misuse.

[03:31:45.509 --> 03:31:51.033]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[03:31:51.033 --> 03:31:56.056]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for the American empire instead of what's fair for the American people.
[03:31:56.056 --> 03:32:02.361]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism, which is why you should be reading the Nationalist Times each month.
[03:32:02.361 --> 03:32:06.824]  We promote a common sense, intelligent, and passionate alternative to the reigning party line.
[03:32:06.824 --> 03:32:14.089]  Published monthly since 1985, the Nationalist Times features outstanding writers and columnists who don't believe in taboos or sacred cows.
[03:32:14.329 --> 03:32:14.649]  I think so.
[03:32:36.926 --> 03:32:37.967]  We will not be forgotten.
[03:32:37.967 --> 03:32:39.327]  We won't be left behind.
[03:32:39.327 --> 03:32:41.068]  Our memories live on in Port-au-Prince.
[03:32:41.068 --> 03:32:41.989]  And boys, feel free.
[03:32:41.989 --> 03:32:42.869]  We'll rise again.
[03:33:06.873 --> 03:33:08.995]  I am a Midwest farmer.
[03:33:08.995 --> 03:33:11.697]  I make a living off the land.
[03:33:11.697 --> 03:33:13.898]  I ride a John Deere tractor.
[03:33:13.898 --> 03:33:16.280]  I'm a liberated man.
[03:33:16.280 --> 03:33:21.103]  The rain, it hasn't fallen since the middle of July.
[03:33:21.103 --> 03:33:24.025]  And if it don't come soon, my crops will die.
[03:33:24.025 --> 03:33:30.490]  The bankman says he likes me, but there's nothing he can do.
[03:33:30.490 --> 03:33:34.093]  He tells me that he's coming, but the clouds are coming too.
[03:33:41.461 --> 03:33:43.203]  The government's not your friend.
[03:33:43.203 --> 03:33:45.084]  It's run by absolutely ruthless criminals.
[03:33:45.084 --> 03:33:48.607]  You need to understand that.
[03:33:48.607 --> 03:33:51.389]  These are very dangerous people.
[03:33:51.389 --> 03:33:54.051]  They are trying to start World War III.
[03:34:04.705 --> 03:34:12.773]  All right, we're going to go to Adam Cuttington here in a minute from We Are Change Kentucky.
[03:34:12.773 --> 03:34:17.257]  And ladies and gentlemen, what happened to them is just so incredible.
[03:34:17.257 --> 03:34:28.307]  I mean, not only being beat up, slammed to the ground, slammed one of their faces into the wall for no reason, equipment stolen, then the cops for close to an hour celebrated the evil.
[03:34:29.125 --> 03:34:35.568]  And we're talking about how they were gonna charge him with felonies and do this and that and threatening him and screaming at him like drill sergeants and then laughing.
[03:34:35.568 --> 03:34:45.614]  I mean, I get really angry to read about grandmothers turning their grandchildren in for warrant money, you know, for marijuana.
[03:34:45.614 --> 03:34:48.155]  And the schools training the children to tattle on their parents.
[03:34:48.155 --> 03:34:50.916]  I mean, this country is far gone.
[03:34:50.916 --> 03:34:54.718]  And I feel the evil growing and I just can't believe how bad we are.
[03:34:54.718 --> 03:34:55.619]  And how sick we are.
[03:34:57.003 --> 03:34:58.764]  And it is just so shameful.
[03:34:58.764 --> 03:35:07.068]  Everybody out there, the only defense to this is being not drinking and driving, not using any pharmacological drugs, not using any illegal drugs.
[03:35:07.068 --> 03:35:11.370]  And just really realizing that the world is very dangerous now.
[03:35:11.370 --> 03:35:16.592]  There are cockroaches and scum and trash and parasites everywhere.
[03:35:16.592 --> 03:35:18.173]  And the only revenge is living well.
[03:35:18.173 --> 03:35:20.914]  The only revenge is making it through this.
[03:35:20.914 --> 03:35:23.035]  And God help us when they fully implode the economy.
[03:35:23.035 --> 03:35:25.116]  The general public are just going to be absolute demons.
[03:35:26.372 --> 03:35:30.333]  And, uh, it's just we are a nation of trash.
[03:35:30.333 --> 03:35:32.073]  It really is true.
[03:35:32.073 --> 03:35:33.633]  And the cancer's growing.
[03:35:33.633 --> 03:35:37.334]  I don't see any way the country can reverse the course.
[03:35:37.334 --> 03:35:40.695]  Uh, it, you know, to see innocence framed.
[03:35:40.695 --> 03:35:48.036]  You know, in my new film, Truth Rising, it won't be out for a few months because we're still adding some things to it, but I show screenings of it the last two nights.
[03:35:48.036 --> 03:35:54.978]  You know, I mean, we got police coming up and saying, that's a gun, your camera's a gun, I'm gonna arrest you for this gun, and laughing with a DV cam tape.
[03:35:57.313 --> 03:35:59.294]  And, you know, you'd probably go to prison for a camera now.
[03:35:59.294 --> 03:36:01.615]  They'll say it's a laser beam.
[03:36:01.615 --> 03:36:02.655]  They'll say it's kryptonite.
[03:36:02.655 --> 03:36:03.115]  I mean, I don't know.
[03:36:03.115 --> 03:36:06.236]  They'll say it's a bomb, a nuclear bomb.
[03:36:06.236 --> 03:36:10.958]  Coming up and saying, we know you don't have bombs, but we're going to say you have bombs.
[03:36:10.958 --> 03:36:12.078]  That's what we are, folks.
[03:36:12.078 --> 03:36:16.280]  I mean, they always frame people, but now they just do it on tape.
[03:36:16.280 --> 03:36:22.502]  And to know that these young men went in there and they just brought, they got press passes, they were polite.
[03:36:22.502 --> 03:36:26.103]  They brought up new government concentration camps to North.
[03:36:27.618 --> 03:36:30.581]  And, uh, they then were leaving.
[03:36:30.581 --> 03:36:39.708]  And, uh, here to just tell, because, I mean, I, I, I, Adam Cuttington, this happened to, with three other guys, called into the Sunday Show and told part of it.
[03:36:39.708 --> 03:36:41.330]  And then I heard and read the rest of it.
[03:36:41.330 --> 03:36:42.891]  It's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[03:36:43.903 --> 03:36:51.885]  And, uh, it was even worse than what he was saying, because they split them all up, you know, telling him, oh, you put one of those memory sticks, because, you know, he had one memory stick in the camera, one in his pocket.
[03:36:51.885 --> 03:36:53.366]  They didn't search him after they stole the cameras.
[03:36:53.366 --> 03:36:55.086]  They said, oh, you got another memory stick.
[03:36:55.086 --> 03:36:59.307]  That was, that's federal evidence, because this is a government facility.
[03:36:59.307 --> 03:37:00.968]  That makes it Homeland Security Federal.
[03:37:00.968 --> 03:37:03.489]  You're going to get a felony for this memory stick in your pocket.
[03:37:03.489 --> 03:37:04.709]  And I'm surprised they didn't say it was
[03:37:05.618 --> 03:37:08.139]  You know, anti-matter Death Star or something.
[03:37:08.139 --> 03:37:09.900]  I mean, you know, I mean that's what they do.
[03:37:09.900 --> 03:37:20.906]  It's just all about lies, all about criminality, all about them ruling and just dominating and being bullies and being scum and they're hiring felons and hiring... I mean, we're... This is bad, folks!
[03:37:20.906 --> 03:37:22.227]  They're building camps!
[03:37:22.227 --> 03:37:23.828]  I have it in the news today here.
[03:37:23.828 --> 03:37:24.709]  I know we got loaded phones.
[03:37:24.709 --> 03:37:25.329]  I'm gonna get to you.
[03:37:27.725 --> 03:37:29.507]  I can't believe this is happening.
[03:37:42.905 --> 03:37:46.327]  They've called for arresting We Are Change, attacking, killing.
[03:37:46.327 --> 03:37:49.668]  They've called for you to be taken to secret camps on national news.
[03:37:49.668 --> 03:37:51.589]  That's a White House talking point.
[03:37:51.589 --> 03:38:01.153]  It scares them so much to have citizens come up at public events and embarrass them with real issues that they are escalating the violence towards us.
[03:38:01.153 --> 03:38:02.633]  People Google Oliver North.
[03:38:02.633 --> 03:38:08.796]  I want people to follow him everywhere he goes, go to every event, and bring up First Amendment questions to him, but bring more people.
[03:38:09.763 --> 03:38:11.866]  Yeah, great to be with you again, Alex.
[03:38:11.866 --> 03:38:12.026]  Yeah, um...
[03:38:31.895 --> 03:38:43.242]  From just being in my own perspective and us splitting pretty much after that happened, you know, I didn't get even everybody else's full account.
[03:38:43.242 --> 03:38:50.886]  Like I said yesterday, we had confronted all over North, first on continuity of government.
[03:38:50.886 --> 03:38:56.349]  We supported a new investigation of 9-11 in camps.
[03:38:56.349 --> 03:38:58.550]  Then Ted Nugent on 9-11.
[03:38:58.550 --> 03:39:01.052]  When we were about to leave, we went
[03:39:02.023 --> 03:39:07.869]  We've seen that Auburn North is doing a book signing in the hall inside to go over and hand him some literature.
[03:39:07.869 --> 03:39:11.553]  And let's be clear, a lot of these guys are former Iraq troops from the last five years.
[03:39:11.553 --> 03:39:21.284]  You go to a death camp for, and that's in the news today, for secret execution before you're thrown into a lime pit for even criticizing the government in Iraq under the democracy.
[03:39:21.704 --> 03:39:27.728]  Alright, uh, they, I stood across the hall when they went up to the table to get the uh, to get that event from another angle, and they ended up swarming at that time, uh,
[03:39:46.801 --> 03:39:50.744]  They confiscated our press passes and told us to leave.
[03:39:50.744 --> 03:40:03.712]  We were walking out the hall and the camera was actually... the officer behind us all tried snatching the camera out of Sam's hand.
[03:40:03.712 --> 03:40:05.373]  That's why he jerked back on it.
[03:40:07.661 --> 03:40:12.885]  He jerked back on a God when he snuck up and grabbed at the camera?
[03:40:12.885 --> 03:40:16.267]  Oh my God, you even looked at a God?
[03:40:16.267 --> 03:40:20.050]  Moses had to look at a bush, you were looking at them?
[03:40:20.050 --> 03:40:23.652]  I mean, he just came up from behind him.
[03:40:23.652 --> 03:40:29.476]  Just from behind him, and I mean, what would be a normal reaction?
[03:40:29.476 --> 03:40:34.700]  So anyway, that's when I believe they tried provoking an incident and actually taking him to the ground.
[03:40:37.113 --> 03:40:45.998]  Have you seen the pictures where they caught him up?
[03:40:45.998 --> 03:40:48.579]  Yeah, I've seen the hand.
[03:40:48.579 --> 03:40:49.280]  The picture of the hand.
[03:40:49.280 --> 03:40:50.660]  Well, that's what Elkata gets.
[03:40:50.660 --> 03:40:54.862]  Well, tell folks what else happened.
[03:40:54.862 --> 03:40:56.743]  Cody was trying to document it.
[03:40:56.743 --> 03:41:01.546]  Two officers rushed him, got his camera.
[03:41:02.738 --> 03:41:16.925]  They proceeded to take all of our cameras at that time, take our memory sticks out of them, tape CDs, what have you, delete our internal memory, take our batteries out of them.
[03:41:16.925 --> 03:41:19.306]  Third World Suspect.
[03:41:19.306 --> 03:41:22.707]  Now let's be clear, you had official press passes?
[03:41:22.707 --> 03:41:28.930]  We had press passes that were acquired weeks before through the NRA Public Affairs Office.
[03:41:29.525 --> 03:41:42.688]  Because on the N-R-A-I-L-A, I believe, dot org website... No, that's the National Registration Assault Grip.
[03:41:42.688 --> 03:41:45.089]  Go ahead.
[03:41:45.089 --> 03:41:48.989]  I said it was open to the press, so I called, gave the credentials.
[03:41:48.989 --> 03:41:51.010]  They were waiting for us when we got there.
[03:41:51.010 --> 03:41:53.030]  Everything was fine.
[03:41:53.030 --> 03:41:53.771]  Oh, this is sick.
[03:41:56.343 --> 03:42:04.689]  Anyway, after they take our memory and our batteries, what have you, um, they kind of get us off to different sides, threaten us with different things.
[03:42:04.689 --> 03:42:16.498]  Uh, Cody's threatened with, uh, federal, I believe, Class D felony for, uh, tampering with evidence, supposedly, because he tried removing the memory stick from his camera before... Tampering with evidence.
[03:42:16.498 --> 03:42:19.140]  Oh, so they were claiming a crime was committed with the cameras.
[03:42:19.140 --> 03:42:20.461]  See how they just make stuff up?
[03:42:20.461 --> 03:42:21.822]  It's totally made up.
[03:42:21.822 --> 03:42:23.463]  False charges, official oppression.
[03:42:26.360 --> 03:42:31.462]  Have you learned the names of any of these dirtbags or they wouldn't give it to you?
[03:42:31.462 --> 03:42:39.344]  They wouldn't give us any information on the officer that... Yeah, they're just going to steal your equipment.
[03:42:39.344 --> 03:42:41.125]  That's probably wasn't even a cop.
[03:42:41.125 --> 03:42:42.465]  They're just going to steal your equipment.
[03:42:42.465 --> 03:42:42.865]  That's it.
[03:42:42.865 --> 03:42:43.866]  They're just shut up.
[03:42:43.866 --> 03:42:45.706]  Shut up.
[03:42:45.706 --> 03:42:49.467]  So what else happened?
[03:42:49.467 --> 03:42:51.048]  Like I said, they were threatening us with felonies.
[03:42:51.048 --> 03:42:51.648]  What have you.
[03:42:51.648 --> 03:42:53.649]  Federal felonies because it was state property.
[03:42:56.705 --> 03:43:07.048]  And, uh, they erased all of our memories, gave us the cameras back, and released Sam and told us to get out here, bandaged from the property for life.
[03:43:07.048 --> 03:43:12.050]  And we went our own ways from there.
[03:43:12.050 --> 03:43:18.972]  But, uh, the entire event, I mean, literally minutes before we were watching Ted Nugent upstairs talk about
[03:43:20.749 --> 03:43:22.470]  Yeah, it's we're way far gone.
[03:43:22.470 --> 03:43:27.472]  I got an article here where there's not 1 million people now in the terror database, it's 8 million.
[03:43:50.132 --> 03:43:53.373]  Oh, we're all terrorists, and the cops are training to fight roadside bombs.
[03:43:53.373 --> 03:43:55.173]  I mean, give me a break, folks.
[03:43:55.173 --> 03:44:00.595]  It's all made up to federalize everything, and they're going to push and push until people fight back, and then they're going to say, see?
[03:44:00.595 --> 03:44:02.915]  There's terrorists everywhere.
[03:44:02.915 --> 03:44:07.456]  You know, oh, this father won't let you take his three-year-old for no reason.
[03:44:07.456 --> 03:44:09.237]  Oh, he's a terrorist.
[03:44:10.513 --> 03:44:12.534]  Oh, I'm the authority.
[03:44:12.534 --> 03:44:22.640]  I'm just so sick of all these do-nothing, nobody people, low IQs that then rule over us and just have their way with us while the bankers set up on a high over us.
[03:44:22.640 --> 03:44:25.022]  I mean, aren't you sick of it, Adam?
[03:44:25.022 --> 03:44:26.083]  I'm completely sick.
[03:44:26.083 --> 03:44:27.123]  I'm fed up.
[03:44:27.123 --> 03:44:31.006]  I'm sick of my stomach, brother.
[03:44:31.006 --> 03:44:33.047]  Yeah, I mean, it's not even an anger or a rage anymore.
[03:44:33.047 --> 03:44:33.627]  I'm just like...
[03:44:37.265 --> 03:44:42.490]  I guess you haven't heard me read the New York Times article where people are turning in their grandchildren for money.
[03:44:42.490 --> 03:44:42.830]  Right.
[03:44:42.830 --> 03:44:45.573]  That's how people make their money in America now, is tattletale lines.
[03:44:45.573 --> 03:44:49.756]  It's ridiculous.
[03:44:49.756 --> 03:44:53.560]  It's... Please stay.
[03:44:53.560 --> 03:44:54.761]  Listen to this.
[03:44:54.761 --> 03:45:01.167]  For tips that bring results, programs in most places pay $50 to $1,000, with some jurisdictions giving bonuses.
[03:45:01.897 --> 03:45:06.361]  For help solving the most serious crimes and extra gun bounty if a weapon is recovered.
[03:45:06.361 --> 03:45:13.446]  That's why the carpet cleaner guy saw a shotgun on a rack on the wall, you know, seven, eight years ago and called the police on me.
[03:45:13.446 --> 03:45:14.027]  Didn't matter.
[03:45:14.027 --> 03:45:17.129]  He thought guns were illegal and he was going to get some money.
[03:45:17.129 --> 03:45:23.154]  And Sussex County, the average payment for a tip that results in arrest is $400.
[03:45:23.154 --> 03:45:25.516]  But then when your car gets stolen, they won't come out.
[03:45:25.516 --> 03:45:27.578]  You gotta, I mean, it's just sick.
[03:45:27.578 --> 03:45:29.299]  A snitch society.
[03:45:29.299 --> 03:45:30.980]  God, I am ashamed of this country.
[03:45:30.980 --> 03:45:31.461]  What about you?
[03:45:32.732 --> 03:45:35.174]  I'm right there with you, brother.
[03:45:35.174 --> 03:45:42.838]  I mean, you know, cops don't even come out to domestic disturbance or what have you, but am I using their First Amendment?
[03:45:42.838 --> 03:45:44.179]  I mean, it's SWAT.
[03:45:44.179 --> 03:45:46.120]  It's sworn, you know?
[03:45:46.120 --> 03:45:47.280]  No, God, that's evil.
[03:45:47.280 --> 03:45:47.901]  You don't talk.
[03:45:47.901 --> 03:45:49.302]  You don't ask questions.
[03:45:49.302 --> 03:45:50.002]  Listen to this.
[03:45:50.002 --> 03:45:57.246]  Usually you deliver the money in an unmarked car and meet them somewhere, he said, but these people come right to the office and walk right to the front door.
[03:45:57.246 --> 03:45:59.187]  So, see, I mean, that's what cops do now.
[03:45:59.187 --> 03:46:00.628]  It's all secret police activity.
[03:46:01.260 --> 03:46:02.240]  They've been totally warped.
[03:46:02.240 --> 03:46:07.743]  There used to be something for a bank robber or for some famous killer, cop killer, there'd be a reward.
[03:46:07.743 --> 03:46:09.443]  Now it's just for everything.
[03:46:09.443 --> 03:46:13.025]  Some Crime Stoppers coordinators say the program repeals the community spirit.
[03:46:13.025 --> 03:46:16.106]  Community spirit!
[03:46:16.106 --> 03:46:16.986]  How degenerate.
[03:46:16.986 --> 03:46:22.248]  And emphasizes that not everyone who calls in is after money.
[03:46:22.248 --> 03:46:25.450]  But their advertising makes no bones about the benefits of a good tip.
[03:46:25.450 --> 03:46:30.972]  Now here in Austin, for at least ten years, they give every elementary and middle school student by a fifth grade
[03:46:31.747 --> 03:46:36.330]  They give them a card, and they get $200 when they turn family members in, and they just teach them, turn your mommy and daddy in.
[03:46:36.330 --> 03:46:43.936]  And then the parents send their children to this place where your children are being taught to look for you doing something wrong?
[03:46:43.936 --> 03:46:45.817]  I mean, this is ridiculous!
[03:46:45.817 --> 03:46:49.220]  We live in a prison with a bunch of drug dealers running it.
[03:46:49.220 --> 03:46:50.841]  I mean, this is sick!
[03:46:50.841 --> 03:46:53.262]  It's not enough for you to bring the drugs in?
[03:46:53.262 --> 03:46:59.427]  You have to then... What would you like to see happen, you know, up on the computer screen?
[03:47:00.446 --> 03:47:15.396]  Up on the document can on the picture of Oliver North from booktour.com forward slash author forward slash North I just type Oliver North book tour and you'll get it confirmed events this Saturday May 24th 6 p.m.
[03:47:15.396 --> 03:47:29.806]  At the Cornerstone Church 726 West Old Hickory Boulevard Madison, Tennessee more info and because he's such an important trafficker and death squad commander from then they're listening You'll be aware of it, but I say 20 30 of you go and just peacefully ask questions
[03:47:30.406 --> 03:47:39.212]  And have people out front in cars to get video of the whole thing and show how the whole anti-terror apparatus is about stopping you from asking questions.
[03:47:39.212 --> 03:47:42.794]  But the border's wide open and drug dealers killed a bunch of cops last week.
[03:47:42.794 --> 03:47:44.896]  Doesn't matter, they'll now learn to work for the CIA.
[03:47:44.896 --> 03:47:47.277]  The CIA's got their proxy.
[03:47:47.277 --> 03:47:51.740]  And we got Sunday Cornerstone Church again, May 25th at 8 p.m.
[03:47:51.740 --> 03:47:55.723]  726 West Old Hickory Road, Madison, Tennessee.
[03:47:55.723 --> 03:47:57.444]  We got a lot of listeners in Tennessee and
[03:47:58.662 --> 03:47:59.722]  People should go to this.
[03:47:59.722 --> 03:48:09.006]  I don't think it'll be as bad there, because they'll just have some local goons, and sometimes you've got cops that still think this is America, and they'll just tell you to leave.
[03:48:09.006 --> 03:48:11.127]  Leave when they say it, though.
[03:48:11.127 --> 03:48:16.729]  Are you thinking about going around Lord North anymore, or have you had enough rodeo with him?
[03:48:16.729 --> 03:48:21.851]  If he comes back around the area, I'll be glad to go ask him questions again.
[03:48:21.851 --> 03:48:22.991]  I mean, it's my patriotic duty.
[03:48:23.962 --> 03:48:32.584]  Well, you guys, even though you had your property stolen, how many memory sticks, how many batteries?
[03:48:32.584 --> 03:48:49.107]  I know of my battery, and I believe another one, me and Cody had memory sticks, or me, Cody, Brad had memory sticks, I believe Sam had a straight-to DVD, I believe, or straight-to mini-disc, I believe.
[03:48:49.107 --> 03:48:51.187]  Well, three batteries, two chips,
[03:48:52.174 --> 03:48:57.178]  We're talking $300 easy of stolen goodies, and that's what they do.
[03:48:57.178 --> 03:48:58.598]  No judge, no jury, no arrest.
[03:48:58.598 --> 03:49:00.660]  They've been in Baghdad.
[03:49:00.660 --> 03:49:02.501]  You're not going to be a slave, and that's the end of it.
[03:49:02.501 --> 03:49:03.882]  Well, we'll talk to you as this develops.
[03:49:03.882 --> 03:49:04.582]  Get a hold of the guys.
[03:49:04.582 --> 03:49:06.164]  I want to have you all on tomorrow.
[03:49:06.164 --> 03:49:06.804]  Take care, Adam.
[03:49:06.804 --> 03:49:08.205]  All right, you too.
[03:49:08.205 --> 03:49:10.006]  Appreciate you, man.
[03:49:10.006 --> 03:49:13.648]  And again, folks, we're in dire straits when they're going after the press like this.
[03:49:13.648 --> 03:49:15.650]  I mean, we're in dire, dire straits.
[03:49:16.877 --> 03:49:19.718]  Not enough to have free speech zones and trample everything.
[03:49:19.718 --> 03:49:21.299]  Don't forget our sponsors.
[03:49:21.299 --> 03:49:22.099]  We've got a final segment.
[03:49:22.099 --> 03:49:28.702]  I'm going to come back and take some calls, but our sponsors for this show are Interfood, Aloes, and eFoods Direct.
[03:49:28.702 --> 03:49:33.245]  And Interfood is the best green food, bar none, out there anywhere that I have found.
[03:49:33.245 --> 03:49:36.626]  20 really power-packed ingredients for 100% absorption.
[03:49:36.626 --> 03:49:39.347]  It's unpasteurized superfoods.
[03:49:39.347 --> 03:49:41.128]  And just, we take it here in the office.
[03:49:41.128 --> 03:49:41.628]  We love it.
[03:49:41.628 --> 03:49:45.030]  Dulse kelp, barley grass, wheatgrass, coralina, spirulina, corella.
[03:49:45.703 --> 03:49:46.103]  We're good to go!
[03:50:11.664 --> 03:50:22.726]  The people that bring you the fine products like the Beta Prostate, like the Colon Cleanse, Body Cleanse, New Vitality, Big Banner up on InfoWars.com.
[03:50:22.726 --> 03:50:24.567]  Be sure and visit that.
[03:50:24.567 --> 03:50:27.827]  Be sure and check that out.
[03:50:27.827 --> 03:50:31.048]  Aloe really flushes you out, really cleans you out, detoxifies you.
[03:50:31.048 --> 03:50:32.028]  It'll probably be illegal sooner.
[03:50:32.028 --> 03:50:32.548]  I'm not joking.
[03:50:32.548 --> 03:50:34.709]  They're trying to ban all herbs products for you.
[03:50:35.149 --> 03:50:35.329]  1-800-569-4056.
[03:50:35.329 --> 03:50:35.409]  1-800-569-4056.
[03:50:35.409 --> 03:50:37.812]  We'll come back in the final segment, but don't forget Aloe's Body Cleanse.
[03:50:37.812 --> 03:50:38.533]  It is a big idea.
[03:50:48.314 --> 03:50:50.075]  A New World Order.
[03:50:50.075 --> 03:50:54.576]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:50:54.576 --> 03:50:57.797]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:50:57.797 --> 03:51:00.598]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:51:00.598 --> 03:51:03.779]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:51:03.779 --> 03:51:11.082]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:51:14.127 --> 03:51:19.571]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:51:19.571 --> 03:51:23.453]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:51:23.453 --> 03:51:26.015]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:51:26.015 --> 03:51:27.176]  Most people have no idea.
[03:51:27.176 --> 03:51:27.956]  They're not after money.
[03:51:27.956 --> 03:51:29.237]  They have all the money they need.
[03:51:29.237 --> 03:51:30.218]  They're after power.
[03:51:30.218 --> 03:51:31.379]  That's what they're after.
[03:51:31.379 --> 03:51:36.122]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[03:51:40.084 --> 03:51:42.906]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:51:42.906 --> 03:51:43.947]  You have been warned.
[03:51:46.469 --> 03:51:51.092]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[03:51:51.092 --> 03:51:55.616]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[03:51:55.616 --> 03:52:02.962]  Another untold story that you've not been told from another untold story dot com.
[03:52:05.322 --> 03:52:17.168]  There is, in the greatest storybook ever written, a statement that the greatest storyteller who ever told a story, and all his stories are true, mind you, that that greatest storyteller is not mocked.

[03:54:46.209 --> 03:54:46.389]  Hey, Alex.
[03:54:46.389 --> 03:54:46.429]  Hi.
[03:55:16.598 --> 03:55:24.880]  For all those people that think that, you know, none of this is happening, you know, I can absolutely vouch for the fact that it is.
[03:55:24.880 --> 03:55:38.003]  And I think that we're so far past the time for arguing and, you know, the people that call your show and, you know, try to say that, you know, you know, to argue with you and then you're out and you're the chicken next, like you like to call them.
[03:55:39.400 --> 03:55:48.862]  You know, in Florida I have a personal experience with the police where I had a car that was bought and paid for.
[03:55:48.862 --> 03:56:00.505]  At the time it was a nice new Explorer and they pulled me over and they threw some dope in the back and they possessed my car.
[03:56:00.505 --> 03:56:03.666]  And I got a felony conviction.
[03:56:03.666 --> 03:56:07.967]  I told my probation officer that I was completely innocent.
[03:56:09.341 --> 03:56:14.384]  He said, yeah, it happens all the time, you know, and, um, that was it.
[03:56:14.384 --> 03:56:17.286]  Now, you know, I'm afraid that, you know, I can't get it done.
[03:56:17.286 --> 03:56:20.848]  What did you say to these, well, what did you say to these hardcore demons?
[03:56:20.848 --> 03:56:23.170]  And hold on, sir, we're going to go into overdrive.
[03:56:23.170 --> 03:56:31.555]  In fact, tell the two, that's all right, just about 15 minutes, because I got a Ron Paul retransmission interview that's coming up on the InfoWare stream in about 20 minutes, so I don't want to miss that.
[03:56:31.555 --> 03:56:35.078]  But I want Mark and Rich and everybody else that's holding to hold over.
[03:56:35.078 --> 03:56:36.839]  We're good for overdrive, another 20 minutes or so?
[03:56:37.439 --> 03:56:38.621]  Good.
[03:56:38.621 --> 03:56:40.243]  But I want to hear your story.
[03:56:40.243 --> 03:56:43.386]  What did you say to this individual?
[03:56:43.386 --> 03:56:44.548]  And for the callers, call in 512-646-5400.
[03:56:44.548 --> 03:56:44.628]  512-646-5400.
[03:56:44.628 --> 03:56:45.749]  Including you, Chris, in Florida.
[03:56:45.749 --> 03:56:47.311]  We'll let you go in a minute.
[03:56:54.139 --> 03:56:56.460]  I mean, did you say to them, why are you doing this to me?
[03:56:56.460 --> 03:56:57.020]  I'm a human.
[03:56:57.020 --> 03:56:58.581]  Did you talk to the psychopaths?
[03:56:58.581 --> 03:57:00.321]  Because sometimes it works to go, I'm a human.
[03:57:00.321 --> 03:57:01.342]  I have a family.
[03:57:01.342 --> 03:57:02.722]  Don't do this.
[03:57:02.722 --> 03:57:03.923]  Or did you smart off to them?
[03:57:03.923 --> 03:57:05.323]  Did he say, hey, I'm going to show you?
[03:57:05.323 --> 03:57:06.164]  Or what happened?
[03:57:06.164 --> 03:57:10.245]  I want to hear specifically how this wickedness happened.
[03:57:10.245 --> 03:57:12.246]  Alex, I was polite as could be.
[03:57:12.246 --> 03:57:15.647]  I had never had an arrest before.
[03:57:15.647 --> 03:57:17.908]  You know, they just, I guess they were
[03:57:18.328 --> 03:57:19.409]  They were bored.
[03:57:19.409 --> 03:57:24.491]  They came over and I said, I was being totally compliant.
[03:57:24.491 --> 03:57:27.453]  I said, you can search my car with the dog if you want.
[03:57:27.453 --> 03:57:28.513]  Well, that's why they did that.
[03:57:28.513 --> 03:57:32.835]  Yeah, because once you've done that, then they can make fake convictions, stick with the consent.
[03:57:32.835 --> 03:57:33.576]  Just work with us.
[03:57:33.576 --> 03:57:36.817]  We're your friends, Mr. Johnson, or whatever your name is.
[03:57:36.817 --> 03:57:37.718]  Right.
[03:57:37.718 --> 03:57:44.381]  And what happened was one of the cops was kind of playing the nice cop, and the other one was playing kind of, you know, the tough guy.
[03:57:44.381 --> 03:57:45.542]  Yeah, it's all about winning.
[03:57:45.542 --> 03:57:47.883]  It's about hurting the American and having the victory.
[03:57:47.883 --> 03:57:47.983]  Yeah.
[03:57:48.767 --> 03:57:48.987]  Why?
[03:57:48.987 --> 03:57:50.329]  You know what I mean?
[03:57:50.329 --> 03:57:51.810]  Because they're evil, sir.
[03:57:51.810 --> 03:57:54.253]  They're probably both hardcore drug dealing felons.
[03:57:54.253 --> 03:57:56.515]  Tell you what, I want to hear more of this story.
[03:57:56.515 --> 03:57:58.657]  I want you to call me right now at 512-646-5400, okay?
