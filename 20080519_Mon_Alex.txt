[00:00.000 --> 00:07.760]  government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the
[00:07.760 --> 00:33.680]  GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:33.680 --> 00:40.440]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. It is May 19th, 2008. We're gonna be live here for
[00:40.440 --> 00:46.720]  the next four hours. I am your host, Alex Jones. Congressman Ron Paul is
[00:46.720 --> 00:52.000]  scheduled to be joining us later into this hour. Then we have Dr. Henry
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.800]  McCount joining us in the second hour. Talk about the history of feminism and
[00:56.800 --> 01:01.800]  to get into how it was orchestrated by the government and the tax-free
[01:01.800 --> 01:06.680]  foundations to break down the families and enslave women, children, men alike.
[01:06.680 --> 01:15.080]  And then Alan Snidow will be joining us. He made the film first, and we're going
[01:15.080 --> 01:20.200]  to be going over how big foreign companies are coming in, paying off
[01:20.200 --> 01:24.440]  politicians, buying the water supplies and water treatment facilities we paid
[01:24.440 --> 01:28.200]  for with tax money, and then doubling, tripling, quadrupling. We're talking
[01:28.200 --> 01:34.840]  about going from a $240 bill to a $1,275 bill. We're talking about going from a
[01:34.840 --> 01:40.160]  $80 bill to a $900 bill. I mean, these are real bills, and this is just what
[01:40.160 --> 01:45.720]  they do. And they all hire their private SWAT teams and siege forces. The U.S. is
[01:45.720 --> 01:51.160]  being subdivided. It's gonna be ruled by different local chieftains overseen by
[01:51.160 --> 01:57.000]  Homeland Security, local merc teams, armies of convicted felons filling the
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.080]  military and police forces. It's already happening. Ladies and gentlemen, the
[02:01.080 --> 02:05.000]  criminals are taking us down. They're just taking over. They're hitting us at
[02:05.000 --> 02:10.760]  every angle. Last night, I showed Truth Rising, and people are coming up to me
[02:10.760 --> 02:13.320]  talking to me, and this fellow came up and showed me his phone, a real nice
[02:13.320 --> 02:18.120]  individual. You see, he was driving down South Lamar, and police pulled him over.
[02:18.120 --> 02:22.240]  They had a drug dog, and he admitted he had a tenth of an ounce of marijuana. He
[02:22.240 --> 02:27.360]  smoked marijuana, like George Washington did. And they're standing there, and the
[02:27.360 --> 02:30.600]  dog just runs right up and bites his leg. And I've seen many videos of this where
[02:30.600 --> 02:34.600]  they just bite you, and it's kind of like the cop will kind of not really pull on
[02:34.600 --> 02:37.840]  the leash. It's kind of like, oh, go ahead, get a little blood. And he showed me photos,
[02:37.840 --> 02:41.720]  these huge bite marks. And then more cops pull up at the scene, and one pulls up
[02:41.720 --> 02:46.760]  and wrecks into another one. And they go, that's it. That was your fault. You
[02:46.760 --> 02:49.080]  wouldn't have had this marijuana. We wouldn't have stopped. This wouldn't have
[02:49.080 --> 02:53.080]  happened. We're charging you with everything. We're charging you with, you
[02:53.080 --> 02:56.960]  name it. I mean, that's how sick it is. I mean, would you rather have people
[02:56.960 --> 03:01.480]  smoking marijuana, or would you rather have fleets of goons and attack dogs
[03:01.480 --> 03:08.760]  running around, pulling us over, feeding on us? What's a greater evil? Hmm? What
[03:08.760 --> 03:16.360]  is a greater evil? And we are changed Kentucky. We are changed Ohio. We're gonna
[03:16.360 --> 03:19.400]  get them on later in the show today. I interviewed one of them. And then I was
[03:19.400 --> 03:23.240]  listening to true revolution radio last night driving home and like 11 o'clock
[03:23.240 --> 03:28.040]  and heard the other guys there. And they went to the NRA convention. They had
[03:28.040 --> 03:31.680]  press passes. They went to the press briefing press conference and asked
[03:31.680 --> 03:35.200]  all over north about the FEMA camp continuity of government plans, the
[03:35.200 --> 03:41.760]  concentration camp plans. And all of a sudden playing close security came over
[03:41.760 --> 03:45.360]  and said, leave. And as they were leaving, one of them just grab the guy
[03:45.360 --> 03:49.920]  tackled him. And then the police ran over with him and Oliver North's private
[03:49.920 --> 03:54.480]  security were there and they stole all their cameras, took the memory chips
[03:54.480 --> 03:58.360]  out, took the batteries out, erased them, didn't give them the chips or the
[03:58.880 --> 04:03.280]  batteries back and then said, we're gonna charge you with federal violations,
[04:03.280 --> 04:08.040]  felonies. And we're making up all this stuff about obstruction of justice
[04:08.040 --> 04:16.960]  federally by having the videos and by trying to, one of them put one of the
[04:16.960 --> 04:20.080]  memory chips in his pocket before they could get to it and they searched him
[04:20.080 --> 04:25.160]  and took it and said, you're trying to, I mean, just made up craziness. Just like
[04:25.160 --> 04:30.080]  a third world country. They got a major lawsuit. They were press accredited.
[04:30.760 --> 04:33.200]  I mean, are we gonna protect press in this country? We're gonna protect
[04:33.200 --> 04:41.400]  activism. I mean, this is just off the charts serious to have that going on.
[04:42.120 --> 04:47.840]  And it's only gonna get worse. They are converting our society over to a
[04:47.840 --> 04:57.200]  giant gulag police by steroid headed psychos. It is a big idea. A new world
[04:57.200 --> 05:02.720]  order in the near future. Earth is dominated by powerful government.
[05:02.720 --> 05:07.960]  It's known as the builder bird. But their objective being world domination.
[05:08.400 --> 05:13.520]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the
[05:13.520 --> 05:18.680]  new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at
[05:18.680 --> 05:26.000]  hand. For the first time in history, the elites plan for world government is
[05:26.000 --> 05:30.160]  blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world

[06:54.400 --> 06:57.600]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single
[06:57.600 --> 07:01.760]  largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes. Acidic waste is created
[07:01.760 --> 07:05.240]  by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment and our high
[07:05.240 --> 07:08.840]  stress lifestyles. It's these choices that cause decreased energy weight
[07:08.840 --> 07:12.680]  gain and eventually disease. The easiest way to reduce disease causing
[07:12.680 --> 07:17.040]  acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water at Snyder health dot com.

[07:58.120 --> 08:04.960]  brother mainstream media government cover ups you want answers well so does
[08:04.960 --> 08:12.000]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin,
[08:12.000 --> 08:21.280]  Texas. Alex Jones. When you read about King George quartering standard
[08:21.280 --> 08:31.320]  standing armies and erecting a multitude of new offices and officers to go out
[08:31.320 --> 08:37.320]  and eat out the substance of the people. The government they had in 1775 and
[08:37.320 --> 08:44.320]  1776 was per capita much, much smaller than it is today. I mean, think about
[08:44.320 --> 08:49.360]  how you pay property tax and sales tax and income tax and state income tax
[08:49.360 --> 08:55.440]  and corporation tax and business tax and regulatory tax and telecommunications
[08:55.440 --> 09:01.880]  tax and water tax and trash pickup tax and taxes on taxes on taxes. I mean,
[09:01.880 --> 09:07.160]  there's thousands of taxes. And what do you get from the government? Just leering
[09:07.160 --> 09:11.360]  thugs in paramilitary outfits, shoving machine guns in your face. I mean, I
[09:11.360 --> 09:19.640]  watched over the weekend at Chicago TV station with the deputy chief who looked
[09:19.640 --> 09:23.240]  like he was wearing a rubber mask. I mean, the guy looked like a space alien or
[09:23.240 --> 09:27.000]  something and you could just tell he looked completely guilty. He looked like
[09:27.000 --> 09:32.240]  a bad guy out of a comic book and his ears were almost on his neck, bizarre
[09:32.240 --> 09:36.000]  looking fellow. And he was just saying, Yeah, we're going to turn all of our
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.280]  police into SWAT teams and they're going to be everywhere now in uniforms to
[09:40.280 --> 09:43.840]  project authority and strength and going to be driving armored vehicles in all
[09:43.840 --> 09:47.600]  the neighborhoods and setting up checkpoints and questioning everyone.
[09:48.040 --> 09:53.000]  And I'm watching this. This is martial law. We're going to hand out, you know,
[09:53.000 --> 09:58.160]  him 16s to everybody and we're going to do this and we're going to show them
[09:58.160 --> 10:02.640]  and it showed cops in black mask black helmets marching around with batons in
[10:02.640 --> 10:09.040]  Chicago. And it said this is in response to increased crime. We've had 20
[10:09.040 --> 10:14.280]  more murders so far this year than we had last year. Well, of course, you've
[10:14.280 --> 10:19.280]  had more murders. You're a crime capital. The son of a famous mob boss runs
[10:19.280 --> 10:23.160]  Chicago. I mean, this is the city where the police publicly shake down the
[10:23.160 --> 10:28.040]  businesses themselves. This is where Al Capone ran the police and then daily
[10:28.080 --> 10:31.600]  ran the police. And then now his son runs the police. I mean, there's not
[10:31.600 --> 10:37.160]  even a debate about it. And they rule. And if you if you cross a cop in
[10:37.160 --> 10:40.280]  Chicago, they'll just pull you out of the car, blow your head off in front
[10:40.280 --> 10:45.120]  of everybody. Do it all the time. I mean, it's like, Hey, listen, scum, we
[10:45.120 --> 10:50.360]  rule, shut your filthy mouth off duty cops, beat women, rape them in bars.
[10:50.360 --> 10:54.840]  Just it's just it's just it's a rain of terror and evil. And it's only going
[10:54.840 --> 10:58.760]  to intensify. And of course, a mafia run city is going to have gun
[10:58.760 --> 11:03.400]  confiscation. Of course, guns are banned in Chicago. And in the surrounding
[11:03.400 --> 11:07.000]  state, they spend a large portion of their state police budget. I've seen
[11:07.000 --> 11:11.240]  it as high as 30% in quote, gun crime enforcement. And what happens is their
[11:11.240 --> 11:14.520]  favorite targets. This has been in the news with the Illinois Rifle
[11:14.520 --> 11:19.760]  Association on over and over again, State Rifle Association. And they will as
[11:19.760 --> 11:24.400]  soon as some 85 86 92 year old man's had a stroke, he goes in, he's back
[11:24.400 --> 11:30.320]  home, his family's taking care of him. The day after his gun registration
[11:30.320 --> 11:38.160]  card is expired, they call them cage teams and raid teams. And they show
[11:38.160 --> 11:41.200]  up and bust down your door because it's a gun owner. And then now they're in
[11:41.200 --> 11:45.000]  criminal gun violation. And they haul out these old guys on gurneys with
[11:45.000 --> 11:50.320]  their colostomy bags and the rest of it. And it's it's just yeah, we did a
[11:50.320 --> 11:56.880]  great job for America. No, what you are is cancer. And you've got every
[11:56.880 --> 12:01.480]  billboard and TV ad paid for about how great you are and how you're gonna and
[12:01.480 --> 12:05.560]  see Americans have been domesticated slowly. First, it was Hey, in the 30s,
[12:05.560 --> 12:07.960]  these trucks are driving on the road, they're messing the road up with their
[12:07.960 --> 12:11.600]  heavy weight. Shouldn't we tax them and the dumb citizens said, Yeah, tax them
[12:11.600 --> 12:15.880]  rich truck drivers was a class thing. We're having to pay for the roads and
[12:15.880 --> 12:18.760]  your trucks are heavier and they're messing them up. They had to have
[12:18.760 --> 12:21.440]  licenses. And then they said, Oh, now you got to have them, which the Supreme
[12:21.440 --> 12:24.160]  Court rulings actually say you don't, but they don't care. The cops are now
[12:24.160 --> 12:26.600]  saying the Second Amendment's a privilege. They don't know. They think
[12:26.600 --> 12:30.840]  travel is a privilege to it's not. It's right. Unless you're in a controlled
[12:30.840 --> 12:35.320]  military grid, which we've been under since 33. Now it's just expanding. Took
[12:35.320 --> 12:38.160]  a long time to bring down the country. They've not done it. And you know,
[12:38.160 --> 12:42.040]  there's just everywhere. Click at her ticket giant signs on skyscrapers in
[12:42.040 --> 12:45.960]  Austin and every other billboard images of cops pulling people over that
[12:45.960 --> 12:49.960]  they're the big guys. They're the boss. They're gonna you're gonna be pulled
[12:49.960 --> 12:53.080]  over and now you're gonna get 10 years in prison for speeding and now you're
[12:53.080 --> 12:58.440]  gonna get a year in jail for dropping a banana peel. And now you're gonna you
[12:58.440 --> 13:04.880]  do anything wrong. Oh, your child fell off the swing in front of witnesses and
[13:04.880 --> 13:08.520]  broke their arms. CPS comes out every time. Break a finger. They come out
[13:08.520 --> 13:11.600]  now all about government. You're alive. All about government questioning you
[13:11.600 --> 13:14.360]  all about government bossing you around in your face.
[13:17.600 --> 13:18.560]  This is what they're doing.
[13:20.160 --> 13:21.800]  And it's gonna get worse
[13:23.200 --> 13:28.320]  and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.
[13:29.640 --> 13:32.080]  Before I digress and forget about it, this is all I'm gonna say.
[13:32.080 --> 13:37.560]  I think all unit no planers ought to really be proud of yourselves. Those of
[13:37.560 --> 13:40.040]  you that are weak minded and have followed the different feds that have
[13:40.040 --> 13:43.760]  put that out. No planes, the towers. You ought to really be proud of yourselves
[13:43.760 --> 13:47.800]  because Howard Stern is now given a no planer a show on his network. That's
[13:47.800 --> 13:50.760]  what the establishment is doing. Ladies and gentlemen, that's what you've done
[13:50.760 --> 13:56.000]  to this country. That's you're not going to stop 9 11 truth. It's one of the
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.160]  only effective attacks the enemy has launched and the people are getting
[14:00.160 --> 14:04.600]  sophisticated and now in realizing exactly what you're doing. If you can't
[14:04.600 --> 14:09.480]  beat us on the facts, you will then magnify cook 9 11 groups to then make
[14:09.480 --> 14:13.080]  us all look bad. It's called black propaganda and it's not gonna work.
[14:13.800 --> 14:17.640]  That's all I'm gonna say on that subject. But people tell me I don't like
[14:17.640 --> 14:21.960]  Howard Stern and he's had bop a buoy call in here, whatever that twitch name
[14:21.960 --> 14:24.920]  and it was him. They bragged about it. They don't like this show. They've
[14:24.920 --> 14:25.880]  called me before.
[14:25.880 --> 14:30.000]  Now, repeatedly, the Howard Stern show has and vetted me to come on and I
[14:30.000 --> 14:34.400]  just basically told them, you know, I don't need to be, you know, told I
[14:34.400 --> 14:37.200]  need to come on and act stupid. Hey, you want to come on and act stupid? We
[14:37.200 --> 14:39.680]  only want you to come on and act stupid. I don't want to come on and act
[14:39.680 --> 14:43.920]  stupid. See, I'm not like that. I won't geek for you so I can get attention
[14:43.920 --> 14:47.960]  to destroy this country. Understand that? That's not how this works. And it's
[14:47.960 --> 14:51.760]  a despicable thing and people should cancel their XM serious contracts
[14:51.760 --> 14:56.240]  because of it. You've got it. You should call them and cancel it. It's disgusting.
[14:58.120 --> 15:02.880]  Nothing but sucking this country down on the pit of hell. As prices rise.
[15:03.280 --> 15:06.600]  Listen to this. This is where our country is. New York Times. As prices
[15:06.600 --> 15:11.680]  rise, crime tipsters work overtime. That's right. One in 10 college grads
[15:11.680 --> 15:16.480]  not to be in Homeland Security related. We're now gonna have just masses,
[15:16.480 --> 15:19.600]  millions and millions of new bureaucrats running around everywhere. There's
[15:19.600 --> 15:27.120]  tattletale tip lines everywhere. Let me explain something. You put your kids
[15:27.120 --> 15:30.240]  in the car and then you jump out of the car and close the door and get mail out
[15:30.240 --> 15:31.000]  of the mailbox.
[15:32.840 --> 15:36.320]  The old woman next door, she doesn't even necessarily want the money. She
[15:36.320 --> 15:41.080]  just sits around watching drama shows and TV shows where CPS are the heroes
[15:41.080 --> 15:45.360]  and where they show them Pavlovianly, people calling CPS on folks and
[15:45.360 --> 15:48.360]  they're wanting to call authorities. They like to be patted on the head. It's
[15:48.360 --> 15:56.200]  a childish feeling of being good. And they're gonna call on you. You yell
[15:56.200 --> 15:58.360]  and scream at your wife in the backyard getting a fight.
[15:59.680 --> 16:02.520]  Just just yelling. Police are coming. You're gonna go to jail. They get
[16:02.520 --> 16:08.440]  money to do that. You need to understand that and then this is just the
[16:08.440 --> 16:12.840]  beginning. This is just the beginning because this is gonna be the new
[16:12.840 --> 16:16.840]  economy. I've read federal documents on this subject. Your high school
[16:16.840 --> 16:21.120]  graduates will all have to serve a year in Stasi cores. Domestically,
[16:21.120 --> 16:23.440]  they're gonna be the new youth core of the government. You imagine all
[16:23.440 --> 16:27.360]  these eight year 18 and 19 year old punks on power trips now. Oh, it's
[16:27.360 --> 16:31.760]  it's wearing gray uniforms. Oh yeah, that was before 9 11. They were
[16:31.760 --> 16:34.120]  training them all over the country for that Homeland Security now moving
[16:34.120 --> 16:38.320]  into all the major schools. A lot of idiot parents are proud of it. My son's
[16:38.320 --> 16:41.480]  very serious. Now he takes his new Hitler youth duties very seriously.
[16:41.480 --> 16:50.400]  Yeah. The gas prices foreclosure rates on the cost of rice. Add this rising
[16:50.400 --> 16:53.720]  economic indicator, the number of tips to the police from people hoping to
[16:53.720 --> 16:55.120]  collect reward money.
[16:56.640 --> 17:00.200]  That's right. Calls to the Southwest Florida Crime Stoppers hotline in the
[17:00.200 --> 17:04.680]  first quarter of this year, up 30% over last year. San Antonio had a 44%
[17:04.680 --> 17:08.800]  increase cities and towns from Detroit to Omaha to Beaumont County,
[17:08.800 --> 17:14.200]  North Carolina, all report a at least 25% or more in the first quarter with
[17:14.200 --> 17:18.160]  temperatures telling operators they need money for rent, light bulbs or baby
[17:18.160 --> 17:23.400]  formula. And it shows they beg and they're they're they're going online
[17:23.400 --> 17:28.480]  and finding law books and they're just watching neighbors like like a Cobra
[17:28.480 --> 17:32.040]  watches a rat just sitting there in the bushes waiting to have that meal.
[17:32.040 --> 17:38.960]  And you get you to understand this is our policies formed. This is all
[17:38.960 --> 17:42.520]  socially engineered local cop doesn't even know it. Again, they're just
[17:42.520 --> 17:46.480]  compartmentalized that when your car gets stolen, your house gets broken into
[17:46.480 --> 17:49.440]  you can't get the police out in Dallas or Austin, Texas and other areas of
[17:49.440 --> 17:53.800]  the country. But I can tell you, I've lived in both. And I mean, I remember
[17:53.800 --> 17:57.640]  being 18, 19 years old, visiting an old girlfriend in Dallas, like I said,
[17:57.640 --> 18:00.200]  and they somebody stole my car and the cops wouldn't come out and said fine
[18:00.200 --> 18:03.040]  and hung the phone up. Then they showed up threatening me saying, why'd you
[18:03.040 --> 18:06.600]  hang up on 9 11? And started searching her apartment. They just walked in,
[18:06.600 --> 18:07.920]  opened the door and they just walked in.
[18:10.600 --> 18:15.800]  It's it's so horrible because but but you call and report a box on the side
[18:15.800 --> 18:19.520]  of the street. They'll come out and freak out with robots and have news
[18:19.520 --> 18:22.720]  cameras because it's all about them posing that there's terrorist and
[18:22.720 --> 18:26.800]  there's fear and then always giving in to every tattletale every little little
[18:26.800 --> 18:32.640]  spy op. See, they only respond to tattletaling. They don't respond. You've
[18:32.640 --> 18:39.440]  actually been violated as prices rise. Crime tipsters work overtime. This is
[18:39.440 --> 18:43.200]  for this year. Everyone that's called has pretty much just been looking for
[18:43.200 --> 18:47.080]  money. Said Sergeant Lawrence Beller who answers crime stoppers calls at the
[18:47.080 --> 18:48.880]  Sussex County, New Jersey Sheriff's Office.
[18:50.120 --> 18:53.680]  That's as opposed to the last couple of years where people were just sick of
[18:53.680 --> 18:58.040]  crime and wanting to do something about it. Yeah, sure they were. They just
[18:58.040 --> 19:01.720]  would act like they were. Now they now they openly beg to you for money. As
[19:01.720 --> 19:04.720]  a result, many programs report a substantial increase in crimes cover
[19:04.720 --> 19:09.160]  related arrest and recovered property as callers turned in neighbors. Grand
[19:09.160 --> 19:14.520]  Children. That's right, folks. They've trained this nation of cowardly scum. We
[19:14.520 --> 19:19.120]  are the ultimate filth. You think the Arabs turn their grandchildren in? Never.
[19:19.120 --> 19:25.120]  You think Mexicans in Mexico turn their family in? Never. Never. They may live
[19:25.120 --> 19:29.840]  in third world cesspits, but they don't turn in that blood. The only in the
[19:29.840 --> 19:32.880]  United States could they kill the instinct for family.
[19:37.360 --> 19:42.560]  Folks, I would cover up crimes if my family was involved. I mean, I'll admit
[19:42.560 --> 19:56.000]  it. You don't go against your family. But I but. Do you know the truth about
[19:56.000 --> 20:00.880]  cancer treatments? Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you
[20:00.880 --> 20:05.200]  are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to
[20:05.200 --> 20:10.200]  survive the treatment? Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning and the
[20:10.200 --> 20:15.920]  poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary? But now it's
[20:15.920 --> 20:21.120]  cancer's turn to die with lace med inks, patented methodology. Without

[22:48.560 --> 23:00.720]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine. Did you know that communism has stated that America would not
[23:00.720 --> 23:05.600]  jump from capitalism to communism? But our elected leaders would pass laws to
[23:05.600 --> 23:10.160]  socialize American, and one day we would wake up and have socialism, communism, and
[23:10.160 --> 23:14.680]  not even know how it happened. Have we seen this very type of socialization of
[23:14.680 --> 23:20.000]  America over the last 60 years? We've been pushed far down the slippery slope of
[23:20.000 --> 23:25.320]  socialism, communism, and don't even know it. Just as Nikita Khrushchev said, we'd
[23:25.320 --> 23:28.800]  like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering

[24:28.440 --> 24:38.200]  It's a good feeling to know the truth, and knowing how serious this world is,
[24:38.200 --> 24:47.920]  how life and death it really is, makes all the baloney not matter anymore. The
[24:47.920 --> 24:53.640]  baubles, the trinkets, the status, the feeling inadequate like the average
[24:53.640 --> 25:03.960]  American does. I have my honor. I know I'm for real. I know that I love liberty and
[25:03.960 --> 25:09.760]  freedom, and I want to see my fellow countrymen be straight and strong and
[25:09.760 --> 25:16.120]  honorable, and I want to see a hatred of evil in the hearts of our people again,
[25:16.120 --> 25:24.640]  and a love of liberty and decency and purity and honor. Instead, we are a
[25:24.640 --> 25:31.480]  nation of white trash, scum, and every other form of trash you can imagine. We
[25:31.480 --> 25:37.560]  are degenerating fast. All we can try to do is have a survivable crash landing.
[25:37.560 --> 25:42.160]  This nation is crashing. We all know it. It began crashing when our morals failed.
[25:42.160 --> 25:46.320]  You have a moral, upstanding, strong fighting country. That means fighting
[25:46.320 --> 25:49.160]  against Terri. That means fighting for your rights, fighting to work hard,
[25:49.160 --> 25:53.320]  fighting to raise your children right. That's what built a country that it was
[25:53.320 --> 25:57.120]  4% of the world's population and more than half the wealth, and now we've been
[25:57.120 --> 26:00.880]  robbed. Our wealth has been taken and used to energize a new world order, and now
[26:00.880 --> 26:05.920]  we're left with the bankrupted husk of what we were. I mean, I read this New
[26:05.920 --> 26:10.280]  York Times story. As prices rise, crime tipsters work overtime, and it says
[26:10.280 --> 26:18.800]  families turn each other in for money. I see this all the time. It's so sick. Now,
[26:18.800 --> 26:21.680]  if I had family burying people in the basement, I'd call the police on them,
[26:21.680 --> 26:25.000]  but I mean, if it was these victimless crimes or something, or you'd go fix it
[26:25.000 --> 26:30.080]  with your family. You know, if somebody was doing something wrong, you'd go. I'm
[26:30.080 --> 26:34.400]  just hypothetically, you know, let's see, out of brother who had a methamphetamine
[26:34.400 --> 26:37.920]  lab, you'd go tear it apart and beat the hell out of them and tell them they
[26:37.920 --> 26:42.320]  ever did it again. Then you'd call the police. You know, you try. There's that
[26:42.320 --> 26:49.400]  instinct to defend your family, and I can't believe you don't have that. I just
[26:49.400 --> 26:52.080]  can't understand because I see these parents just give their children up to
[26:52.080 --> 26:55.080]  CPS when the parents have done nothing wrong, and they'll cry and be sad about
[26:55.080 --> 26:58.880]  it, but they're just, they've had their instinct cut off. Now, the illegal
[26:58.880 --> 27:03.520]  aliens happen. They run every time. So the CPS leaves them alone or they'll,
[27:03.520 --> 27:08.560]  they'll, they'll, they'll shoot or they'll stab because they have their heads
[27:08.560 --> 27:13.160]  screwed on straight. They're nationalistic. They're hardworking. They may not
[27:13.160 --> 27:15.600]  fight back against the tyranny of their government because they've been enslaved
[27:15.600 --> 27:20.960]  so long. They only, they can win, but at least they try all the time. I actually
[27:20.960 --> 27:26.640]  admire the illegal aliens compared to what this country's turned into because
[27:26.640 --> 27:30.080]  illegal aliens won't turn their families in.
[27:30.200 --> 27:41.200]  It's disgusting. The Asians won't do it either. White trash, blacks, that's who
[27:41.200 --> 27:45.160]  turns their families in in this country. Black people and white people should be
[27:45.160 --> 27:51.360]  ashamed of ourselves. We should be ashamed of ourselves, ashamed of ourselves.
[27:51.360 --> 27:54.200]  Does that mean there aren't Hispanics that don't turn family in? Does that mean
[27:54.200 --> 27:58.040]  there aren't Asians? I've seen the contradistics though. There are not many.
[27:58.040 --> 28:00.200]  Shame on us.
[28:05.720 --> 28:09.320]  And it goes on to say, listen to this, I'm in a bind. I'm in a bind. This is
[28:09.320 --> 28:13.680]  recording. She told the hotline operator, there's a lot of stuff I know, but I, but
[28:13.680 --> 28:18.600]  I didn't open my mouth. If I weren't in a bind, I wouldn't open my mouth. When she
[28:18.600 --> 28:21.520]  learned the money was not available, she said she would call back when the
[28:21.520 --> 28:26.720]  whereabouts of another suspect whom she had seen going down the road.
[28:26.720 --> 28:32.000]  Ellen Coyd, the president of Crime Stoppers USA, that is Stasi Destroy America USA,
[28:32.000 --> 28:36.760]  a national organization of local tip programs, said that not all the 323
[28:36.760 --> 28:40.520]  programs in the country have reported an increase in calls and that some, like
[28:40.520 --> 28:44.440]  those in Lafayette, Louisiana and Ballard County, Florida, attributed most of
[28:44.440 --> 28:49.320]  their spike to increase publicity or technology improvements like accepting
[28:49.320 --> 28:54.600]  tips by tech message. You got to love it. Somebody sends a text message in and
[28:54.600 --> 28:58.400]  then they swat team your house. Every day I read about a swat team going to an
[28:58.400 --> 29:02.800]  insurance salesman's house, some old woman's house, you know, they'll shoot a
[29:02.800 --> 29:12.720]  94 year old woman 50 something times. It's unbelievable, man. Unbelievable. This
[29:12.720 --> 29:18.320]  country so far gone and it just goes on to how people turn their families in
[29:18.320 --> 29:23.120]  for marijuana. Imagine turning your kid in because they're smoking marijuana
[29:23.120 --> 29:30.320]  because you want $500. $500. I would starve to death in a ditch before I
[29:30.320 --> 29:35.600]  called on my neighbors, much less my family. There's people I hate who I know
[29:35.600 --> 29:40.000]  all sorts of bad stuff about and I cannot make myself call reports in on
[29:40.000 --> 29:48.760]  them. I can't do it. We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and
[29:48.760 --> 29:59.480]  the GCN radio network. It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future,
[29:59.480 --> 30:04.680]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government. It's known as the Builder
[30:04.680 --> 30:10.360]  Bird. Could their objective be world domination? For thousands of years, their
[30:10.360 --> 30:15.400]  dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great
[30:15.400 --> 30:23.760]  dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history,
[30:23.760 --> 30:28.560]  the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the
[30:28.560 --> 30:32.800]  secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda. Builder Bird is making great
[30:32.800 --> 30:36.040]  progress toward a world government. Most people have no idea. They're not after
[30:36.040 --> 30:38.800]  money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their
[30:38.800 --> 30:44.400]  aptitude. Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or

[30:55.800 --> 30:58.600]  been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform
[30:58.600 --> 31:01.480]  you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the
[31:01.480 --> 31:05.640]  last 50 years. For the last three years, the earth has consumed more food than it
[31:05.640 --> 31:09.040]  has been able to produce, and it has now finally caught up with this. In the U.S.
[31:09.040 --> 31:12.280]  commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed, and the next
[31:12.280 --> 31:16.160]  rice crop won't be available for another four to five months. It's fall in the
[31:16.160 --> 31:19.280]  southern hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary to make it
[31:19.280 --> 31:22.120]  through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[31:22.120 --> 31:26.480]  Remember our trade deficit? Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the
[31:26.480 --> 31:30.680]  country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price. By late
[31:30.680 --> 31:34.280]  summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control

[33:56.400 --> 34:00.680]  the book that we're carrying, The Revolution Manifesto. Number one on the
[34:00.680 --> 34:04.560]  New York Times bestseller list and holding there, sold out across most of
[34:04.560 --> 34:08.520]  the nation with the third printing about to come out. And we are extremely
[34:08.520 --> 34:12.680]  honored to have Congressman Ron Paul on with us for the next 25 minutes.
[34:12.680 --> 34:16.920]  Congressman, congratulations on waking up tens of millions of people for the
[34:16.920 --> 34:20.280]  message of liberty with your ongoing campaign. Congratulations on having the
[34:20.280 --> 34:24.720]  New York Times number one bestseller. Thank you very much, and I appreciate all
[34:24.720 --> 34:29.480]  your help for getting so many people interested in this subject. Well, we're
[34:29.480 --> 34:33.480]  all in this together, and my liberty depends on your liberty and all of us
[34:33.480 --> 34:37.240]  together, so I thank you, sir. It's all symbiotic. Out of the gates before we get
[34:37.240 --> 34:41.440]  into the book, we are having a lot of debates, discussions within the
[34:41.440 --> 34:45.840]  Revolution that you're the focal point of about what's really happening, why
[34:45.840 --> 34:49.560]  we're getting the delegates, what's going to happen at the convention. What
[34:49.560 --> 34:53.160]  would you like to see happen at the convention, and what do you think is
[34:53.160 --> 34:59.080]  realistic, and what do you think is constitutional? Well, the most realistic
[34:59.080 --> 35:03.200]  thing that could happen is for us to have a presence there, a very positive
[35:03.200 --> 35:08.280]  presence, an enthusiastic presence, and a lot of people, which means we have
[35:08.280 --> 35:11.920]  delegates. There aren't that many. There's going to be several dozen. That's
[35:11.920 --> 35:15.320]  about all. There's going to be a lot of alternates, but there's going to be a lot
[35:15.320 --> 35:19.800]  of people around. Of course, we're going to have a rally up there as well, you
[35:19.800 --> 35:24.320]  know, at the university, so we, I would say maybe the biggest thing will come
[35:24.320 --> 35:28.120]  over the whole thing would be a grand rally, which will get some attention,
[35:28.120 --> 35:32.320]  because otherwise the whole convention's going to be pretty boring. I think to be
[35:32.320 --> 35:36.840]  realistic, you know, we can't challenge the system. You know, even if we come
[35:36.840 --> 35:41.040]  close to controlling a delegation, they bend the rules, or break the rules, or
[35:41.040 --> 35:44.760]  ignore the rules, and they run rough shot over you, but that doesn't mean that
[35:44.760 --> 35:49.720]  that should diminish our enthusiasm, because what really counts are ideas.
[35:49.720 --> 35:53.320]  Our ideas are more powerful than all the shenanigans that they
[35:53.320 --> 35:58.560]  pool, so I don't expect us to have any official presence at the convention.
[35:58.560 --> 36:02.240]  They're not going to give me a speaking engagement, I'm quite certain, and they're
[36:02.240 --> 36:05.280]  not going to allow a nomination or something like that, because they're
[36:05.280 --> 36:09.800]  not going to allow us to qualify. But that shouldn't discourage us in any way,
[36:09.800 --> 36:14.480]  because I think our momentum is actually building. You know, the number of people
[36:14.480 --> 36:18.880]  who are looking, you know, for information on Facebook and other places are
[36:18.880 --> 36:23.800]  actually climbing right now, not declining, even though people say, well,
[36:23.800 --> 36:29.040]  the campaign is essentially over. Well, the long-term campaign is really, really
[36:29.040 --> 36:32.240]  just getting started, and we just had a tremendous boost. So I think we have to
[36:32.240 --> 36:36.680]  be realistic. We're not going to be able to beat them under their own rules,
[36:36.680 --> 36:42.640]  because they don't follow up. At the same time, since our ideas are so powerful,
[36:42.640 --> 36:47.440]  and those ideas that time has come for them, they can't really quiet us at
[36:47.440 --> 36:51.480]  all. The only thing I'm asking for is that everybody do it in a dignified manner,
[36:51.480 --> 36:58.160]  and not to be, you know, looking for confrontation, and our ideas are
[36:58.160 --> 37:02.480]  powerful enough that we don't have to resort to any wild tactics.
[37:02.480 --> 37:08.840]  Shifting gears along that same line, though, Jim Tucker a few weeks ago was
[37:08.840 --> 37:14.160]  able to get some of the minutes out of the Trilateral Commission annual meeting,
[37:14.160 --> 37:19.040]  and Jim has always given us good intel from Bilderberg, good intel from
[37:19.040 --> 37:23.200]  trilateral meetings, from his sources, and so I found him to be an accurate source.
[37:23.200 --> 37:27.240]  He's predicted a lot of things before they happen from these sources, and he
[37:27.240 --> 37:32.200]  said that in the main Trilateral Commission meeting, you were specifically
[37:32.200 --> 37:36.520]  brought up, and they said, not your, you know, the the campaign, and they said,
[37:36.520 --> 37:40.520]  yeah, they're not in danger of you becoming president now, but that the idea
[37:40.520 --> 37:45.840]  has gotten Flashpoint and the tens of millions have woken up, and that they
[37:45.840 --> 37:50.240]  wanted to do basically media hit pieces on you, or try to pressure you through
[37:50.240 --> 37:55.080]  the House leadership in the coming months to shut you up, and to stop you
[37:55.080 --> 37:59.480]  going out to universities and energizing young people, and they bemoaned that the
[37:59.480 --> 38:03.160]  false left-right paradigm was shattering, and that young people, instead of being
[38:03.160 --> 38:07.600]  young socialists like the 60s, are becoming freedom lovers, and that they
[38:07.600 --> 38:12.600]  were very concerned. Yeah, you know, there's probably something to this, but
[38:12.600 --> 38:18.320]  isn't it interesting, the Republicans are annoyed, but in a way, the Republicans
[38:18.320 --> 38:22.200]  should welcome me, because I could neutralize some of the young people's
[38:22.200 --> 38:29.000]  support for Obama, but I think what you're telling me explains that it isn't
[38:29.000 --> 38:33.360]  the Republicans that run the show, or the Democrats, but it's the, you know, the
[38:33.360 --> 38:37.560]  powerful special interest, the elites, who control both parties, you know, the
[38:37.560 --> 38:41.560]  Trilateral people and others, they're the ones who are frightened from our ideas,
[38:41.560 --> 38:46.920]  because they would be very intimidated by, say, a gold standard, or a non-interventions
[38:46.920 --> 38:50.600]  foreign policy, where we're not policing the world, and we challenge the
[38:50.600 --> 38:55.200]  military-industrial complex, but if it were strictly a political ploy, I would
[38:55.200 --> 38:58.840]  think that we could serve the Republican interest, they should welcome us, a couple
[38:58.840 --> 39:04.560]  million people coming in, why offend us, and then we would
[39:04.560 --> 39:09.080]  neutralize some of this enthusiasm for Obama, but I think the controlling
[39:09.080 --> 39:12.440]  interests are the ones who are the most important in this story. Well, you're
[39:12.440 --> 39:16.040]  right, it doesn't matter if 91% of Americans want to control our sovereignty
[39:16.040 --> 39:19.680]  on our border in a Gallup poll, both parties are against it, it doesn't matter
[39:19.680 --> 39:24.120]  if 70 to 80% want to end the war in both parties, the establishment, both parties
[39:24.120 --> 39:29.040]  are for it, we see this collision happening, how do you see that unfolding as
[39:29.040 --> 39:33.440]  your predictions about the economy come true, as the chickens come home to roost,
[39:33.440 --> 39:38.600]  as the dollar implodes, as our name implodes, it seems the establishment gets
[39:38.600 --> 39:44.400]  more authoritarian and more arrogant as everyone turns against them.
[39:44.400 --> 39:50.080]  Yeah, it's more dangerous than ever because, you know, up till now, for the
[39:50.080 --> 39:53.600]  last hundred years, they've controlled everything through economic power and
[39:53.600 --> 39:58.720]  the Federal Reserve and the banks and the budgetary process, but when that
[39:58.720 --> 40:04.080]  fails, when the budgetary process fails and the dollar fails and even
[40:04.080 --> 40:08.880]  their own system is challenged, then they don't have the financial
[40:08.880 --> 40:11.440]  community that can hold us together because the markets are actually more
[40:11.440 --> 40:19.360]  powerful than anything else. I mean, they couldn't, you know, they couldn't
[40:19.360 --> 40:23.200]  fix the price of gold, the fight price of gold eventually breaks down, but the
[40:23.200 --> 40:27.040]  danger is, instead of resorting just to manipulating the economy behind the
[40:27.040 --> 40:30.080]  scenes, all of a sudden, the whole things together, they have to become more
[40:30.080 --> 40:33.920]  authoritarian and look at what's happened. You know, it's more authoritarian
[40:33.920 --> 40:37.920]  from top to bottom, whether it has to do with overseas activity, whether it has to
[40:37.920 --> 40:43.120]  do with spying on American citizens and doing all the harassment here at home
[40:43.120 --> 40:49.360]  and national ID cards and more control of the economy. So, this is the
[40:49.360 --> 40:54.080]  contest going on. Are the American people going to put up with it and say,
[40:54.080 --> 40:58.240]  you know, whatever they want to do, let them do, but this is, to me, a
[40:58.240 --> 41:01.520]  tremendous opportunity because up until now, the American people have been
[41:01.520 --> 41:04.560]  complacent. They say, oh, the government's going to help me. I'm doing
[41:04.560 --> 41:08.160]  fine and I'll do my best, but if I need help, the government's going to take care
[41:08.160 --> 41:12.000]  of me, and they've been complacent and they accept the help, but now the
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.960]  government's running out of this ability, ability to help, and all they can
[41:14.960 --> 41:21.360]  offer is more force and authoritarianism, so the conflict, I'm sure, will build.
[41:21.360 --> 41:24.960]  And time frame-wise, you've been pretty accurate in the past on when you
[41:24.960 --> 41:28.960]  thought things would break down. I remember in 2003, the war just started,
[41:28.960 --> 41:33.280]  you were speaking in Bastrop outside Austin, and I asked you, I said,
[41:33.280 --> 41:36.480]  when do you think things will start, really start unraveling? You said,
[41:36.480 --> 41:40.080]  well, it could happen any time, but probably five, six, seven years from now.
[41:40.080 --> 41:44.240]  You know, these things can build a long time, and here we are five, six years
[41:44.240 --> 41:48.320]  later. How long can this bubble just continue on?
[41:48.320 --> 41:51.920]  Well, I think it's starting to unravel. I mean, when you look at
[41:51.920 --> 41:56.400]  last year's value of the dollar, that's certainly been a major attack.
[41:56.400 --> 41:59.200]  I think the most significant event going on right now
[41:59.200 --> 42:05.680]  is the prices going up, the price inflation. People are now getting
[42:05.680 --> 42:09.040]  scared. They want pay raises, and they want help.
[42:09.040 --> 42:14.000]  And this, the psychology has changed, and yet the government
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.240]  just tries to deceive everybody by continuing their life. They keep telling
[42:18.240 --> 42:24.080]  us, you know, this last report on the CPI, they
[42:24.080 --> 42:27.040]  tried to say it was like a 2% or something like that,
[42:27.040 --> 42:31.280]  and they said that actually that energy prices went down
[42:31.280 --> 42:35.280]  because they averaged them out for the year. Nobody believes that nonsense
[42:35.280 --> 42:39.840]  anymore, so they're being hit and they're hurting,
[42:39.840 --> 42:43.200]  but that's the reason they're not going to be content with some of the
[42:43.200 --> 42:46.480]  cliches from the government. They're going to, and that's why they're
[42:46.480 --> 42:49.840]  looking toward us to try to figure out the problem and what the answers are
[42:49.840 --> 42:53.440]  going to be. Well, exactly. Just six, seven months ago,
[42:53.440 --> 42:59.440]  in the winter of 2007, you had Bernanke in front of you, the new Fed
[42:59.440 --> 43:04.960]  Chief, and he said that, oh, we have 2.4% inflation,
[43:04.960 --> 43:08.720]  and then you said, well, even mainstream news says it's more like seven or
[43:08.720 --> 43:12.640]  ten. I'm going for memory on this, and then basically you just laughed at him,
[43:12.640 --> 43:15.920]  and so did the media. I mean, how are they going to continue when most of the
[43:15.920 --> 43:19.760]  private groups that analyze it say 13 to 15%
[43:19.760 --> 43:24.400]  mainstream news is saying 10, 12%. I mean, how are they going to deny that
[43:24.400 --> 43:27.200]  inflation is going on and that oil prices are up
[43:27.200 --> 43:30.720]  because the dollar has gone in the toilet? I mean, just a month ago, they
[43:30.720 --> 43:34.240]  asked the White House Press Secretary, they said, is it true that oil's up
[43:34.240 --> 43:37.520]  because the dollar's down? And she said, I can't answer that question, I'd be
[43:37.520 --> 43:39.680]  fired. Like, we have to, like, three-year-old
[43:39.680 --> 43:45.040]  children go to the White House and say, is it true the dollar's been devalued?
[43:45.040 --> 43:49.440]  Can you speak to that, Congressman? Well, you know, the more they do that,
[43:49.440 --> 43:52.880]  the more they lose credibility, and that helps us because nobody's going to
[43:52.880 --> 43:56.560]  believe them. But that is the whole point, and that's why
[43:56.560 --> 44:00.000]  drilling home all the time is you've got to think about the value of the dollar,
[44:00.000 --> 44:03.440]  and then that brings in the whole context of the idea of spending too much
[44:03.440 --> 44:07.280]  money and overtaxing, overbarring, and then printing the money.
[44:07.280 --> 44:10.800]  And more people are starting to think about that now. You know, when I first
[44:10.800 --> 44:13.920]  started, I was reluctant because I didn't think anybody
[44:13.920 --> 44:17.520]  would care about the Federal Reserve system, and they'd laugh me right off
[44:17.520 --> 44:21.360]  the stage. But this now gets the loudest applause on
[44:21.360 --> 44:25.920]  university campuses when I bring up the idea of money and monetary policy.
[44:25.920 --> 44:30.400]  And even Amazon has responded by selling some of Murray Rothbard's book and
[44:30.400 --> 44:35.520]  advertising him about the money. So I think we make great strides. Exactly.
[44:35.520 --> 44:39.120]  That's why the Trilateral Commission is afraid. Last week, I had the head of the
[44:39.120 --> 44:42.560]  Kissinger Group on the show, and I was talking to him before he went on air, and
[44:42.560 --> 44:45.360]  he goes, we know who you are, Alex. Yes, we're aware of your work. If they're
[44:45.360 --> 44:48.400]  aware of me and you're much bigger than I am, I mean, when we've got the head of
[44:48.400 --> 44:50.960]  the Kissinger Group agreeing to come on my show
[44:50.960 --> 44:54.880]  to try to counter us, that means they really are upset. I mean, if they're
[44:54.880 --> 44:58.240]  talking about you as the number one topic and saying, yeah,
[44:58.240 --> 45:01.840]  they're waking up about the monetary system, that was the other point they made,
[45:01.840 --> 45:06.560]  that shows we're really hurting them. And the thing that we have to look for
[45:06.560 --> 45:11.840]  is if they start cracking down even more so. If they start
[45:11.840 --> 45:15.920]  wanting to tax and control and regulate the internet and going after radio
[45:15.920 --> 45:19.040]  talk show hosts, I mean, that's when we'll be in big trouble, because
[45:19.040 --> 45:23.040]  fortunately, you know, we complain a lot about how bad things are going, but I
[45:23.040 --> 45:26.000]  still brag that we do live in a good country, and it's worth
[45:26.000 --> 45:30.720]  saving, and we've had great traditions. And I've been pretty fortunate to
[45:30.720 --> 45:35.360]  run on what I believe in and vote that way and still get re-elected. So
[45:35.360 --> 45:39.920]  we, as bad as things are, we don't live in a totalitarian state,
[45:39.920 --> 45:44.240]  although that's what we fear. And that's why we have to be alert and vigilant,
[45:44.240 --> 45:48.720]  because if they move quickly to get rid of our ability to communicate,
[45:48.720 --> 45:52.560]  then we're in big trouble. Well, that's what I wanted to say, is that it was the
[45:52.560 --> 45:56.240]  best of times, it was the worst of times. Our lives are great, our families are
[45:56.240 --> 45:59.680]  great, it's still the best country in the world, but in the sectors
[45:59.680 --> 46:02.480]  and the corridors of power, it's never been more corrupt,
[46:02.480 --> 46:06.240]  more infested with the White House writing memos about torturing children
[46:06.240 --> 46:09.840]  and saying it's okay. And that's my point, is they're definitely
[46:09.840 --> 46:14.160]  making a move and trying. I think they are getting pushed back at some levels.
[46:14.160 --> 46:18.800]  Is that an accurate statement from... Well, I think so, it's because the number
[46:18.800 --> 46:22.880]  of people who have become disenchanted are growing, because the standard of
[46:22.880 --> 46:26.640]  living is going down. That's back to the monetary policy. People are still
[46:26.640 --> 46:30.160]  making nominal dollars, but the dollars aren't going as far. The people on
[46:30.160 --> 46:33.440]  retirement are social security. They're getting benefits, but all of a sudden
[46:33.440 --> 46:36.560]  they're much poorer, because they're losing 10% of their
[46:36.560 --> 46:40.000]  purchasing power every year, so every year they get poorer, and that's why
[46:40.000 --> 46:43.840]  people are very stirred up. You know, even though at every rally, I talk
[46:43.840 --> 46:47.360]  about just getting young people out of social security and doing our best to
[46:47.360 --> 46:50.560]  take care of those people who are dependent, but you never get boozed
[46:50.560 --> 46:53.360]  from elderly people who are worried about getting their checks,
[46:53.360 --> 46:56.560]  because they know if we, our side straightens up the mess,
[46:56.560 --> 47:00.240]  they're more likely to get something from their social security,
[47:00.240 --> 47:04.480]  where they know what's happening now, is if we continue this,
[47:04.480 --> 47:08.240]  that everybody is going to suffer. The people who are receiving checks from
[47:08.240 --> 47:11.360]  the government, as well as those who are expected to continue to work.
[47:11.360 --> 47:15.040]  Now, I want to shift gears into another topic. This just came out in the
[47:15.040 --> 47:18.560]  mainstream news last Thursday. I know you're quite a news hound yourself.
[47:18.560 --> 47:21.760]  You may not have heard it, but you hear about the Rumsfeld tape with all these
[47:21.760 --> 47:25.760]  fake military advisors on Pentagon payroll they
[47:25.760 --> 47:29.200]  have on the news. Bringing up, boy, we're shirting another
[47:29.200 --> 47:33.040]  terror attack to get our agenda through without another attack.
[47:33.040 --> 47:36.640]  We're not going to be able to get our agenda through. A, are you aware of that?
[47:36.640 --> 47:41.520]  And B, what do you think of that statement? Well, just vaguely, I don't know the
[47:41.520 --> 47:45.760]  details, so I really can't make a very good statement on that, but
[47:45.760 --> 47:50.160]  anything's possible with these guys. Let me just play it. It's about a minute long.
[47:50.160 --> 47:54.240]  This is Rumsfeld 2006, Washington Post, Associated Press,
[47:54.240 --> 47:58.800]  prisonplanet.com, and you can go listen to hours of it. This is with the
[47:58.800 --> 48:03.600]  the military consultants, experts they have on all the major news channels.
[48:03.600 --> 48:07.760]  He's in a room full of them. Here it is. This president is pretty much a victim of
[48:07.760 --> 48:11.360]  success. We haven't had an attack in five years.
[48:11.360 --> 48:17.440]  Help. The perception of the threat is so low
[48:17.440 --> 48:23.280]  in the society that it's not surprising that the behavior
[48:23.280 --> 48:26.320]  pattern reflects a low threat assessment.
[48:26.320 --> 48:31.840]  And the same thing is in Europe, there's a low threat perception.
[48:33.760 --> 48:40.560]  Correction for that, I suppose, is an attack. And when that happens, then
[48:40.560 --> 48:45.600]  everyone gets energized for another person, and it's a shame. We don't
[48:45.600 --> 48:50.320]  have the maturity to recognize the
[48:50.320 --> 48:53.520]  serious stuff in those threats. Okay, congressman, we're able to hear that.
[48:53.520 --> 48:57.680]  They say to him, don't we need another attack? And then his answer is yes.
[48:57.680 --> 49:01.760]  I guess the cure for this is another attack.
[49:01.760 --> 49:04.960]  Yeah, and I think that's the way they do think.
[49:04.960 --> 49:08.880]  I've never gotten to the point where they absolutely
[49:08.880 --> 49:13.680]  prove, plan every event. But boy, when there is an opportunity,
[49:13.680 --> 49:17.520]  do they jump at it. They had planned for a long time on the
[49:17.520 --> 49:20.880]  Patriot Act, but they had to wait for the right time.
[49:20.880 --> 49:25.120]  They had planned for a long time to invade Iraq
[49:25.120 --> 49:31.200]  as early as 2008, the plans were late. I mean, you know, 1998, you know, the
[49:31.200 --> 49:34.720]  plans were late. But they wait for opportunities, they
[49:34.720 --> 49:38.160]  help create them, they manipulate them, they do whatever is necessary.
[49:38.160 --> 49:41.360]  We have a clip of Gary Hart... Sorry, congressman, go ahead.
[49:41.360 --> 49:44.560]  They do know public opinion is important. They got to get the consensus of people
[49:44.560 --> 49:47.600]  to rally behind them. Have you seen the Gary Hart clip where
[49:47.600 --> 49:50.480]  he not only wrote a letter to Iran, we now interviewed him, and he said,
[49:50.480 --> 49:53.920]  yes, I'm worried the government will stage another Gulf of Tonkin
[49:53.920 --> 49:57.760]  or USS Main Event to attack Iran. Of course, I've been
[49:57.760 --> 50:02.160]  worrying about that all along, and once again, I always take the position.
[50:02.160 --> 50:06.400]  I always hope that they don't do it on their own. I hate
[50:06.400 --> 50:11.040]  thinking they're capable, but yet they are. But no matter what, whether it's an
[50:11.040 --> 50:15.120]  accident or they deliberately do it, or one individual does it, or they hire
[50:15.120 --> 50:18.160]  somebody to do it, an event has to happen to
[50:18.160 --> 50:21.680]  really get the people behind it and be complacent enough to
[50:21.680 --> 50:26.080]  send more kids off to get killed. Final segment with the congressman. We'll have
[50:26.080 --> 50:28.560]  five minutes on the other side. I'll have two questions for him.
[50:28.560 --> 50:32.160]  What does he think of the field of candidates? I mean,
[50:32.160 --> 50:35.760]  dumb, dumber, and dumbest. That's my opinion. I mean, big government,
[50:35.760 --> 50:38.480]  either way, you roll the dice, it's a rigged game.
[50:38.480 --> 50:41.920]  They own all the horses, and we'll talk about his book,
[50:41.920 --> 50:45.920]  The Revolution Amantifesto, number one on the New York Times best-selling list.
[50:45.920 --> 50:51.440]  He's going to be at Book People, one of the book facilities here in Austin,
[50:51.440 --> 50:53.680]  Texas today. We'll tell you where that's going to be as well.
[50:53.680 --> 50:57.520]  Our beloved republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying
[50:57.520 --> 50:59.920]  national sovereignty worldwide. But in Liberty's
[50:59.920 --> 51:03.360]  darkest hour, there is hope. The first time in modern history, the
[51:03.360 --> 51:07.040]  people are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide
[51:07.040 --> 51:09.680]  accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order
[51:09.680 --> 51:12.720]  master plan. We have a short time frame to fully awaken and
[51:12.720 --> 51:17.200]  energize the people to meet this threat. In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv
[51:17.200 --> 51:20.000]  is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[51:54.240 --> 51:58.080]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[51:58.080 --> 52:02.160]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[52:02.160 --> 52:06.080]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than 200 billion dollars
[52:06.080 --> 52:10.160]  annually, with the worst toll taken by antibiotics. But there is a cure for this
[52:10.160 --> 52:14.480]  medical madness that has remained secret. Oxysilver, developed by NASA scientists
[52:14.480 --> 52:18.480]  to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement
[52:18.480 --> 52:21.680]  making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[52:21.680 --> 52:26.240]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[52:26.240 --> 52:29.440]  Oxysilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[52:29.440 --> 52:33.520]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system
[52:33.520 --> 52:37.840]  to fight colds, flus, cancers, and more. Build disease defenses naturally,
[52:37.840 --> 52:42.160]  painlessly, powerfully, safely, and inexpensively with Oxysilver.
[52:42.160 --> 52:48.240]  Order your supply now by calling toll-free 1-877-817-9829.
[52:48.240 --> 52:52.880]  That's 1-877-817-9829. Do it now.
[52:53.920 --> 52:57.680]  Why should we fire Congress? Because they use the Constitution of the United States
[52:57.680 --> 53:01.200]  as a scrap of paper. They swear an oath to follow it and then they reject it.
[53:01.200 --> 53:04.960]  That was their employment document. They haven't followed it.
[53:04.960 --> 53:08.720]  Congressman, senators, you're fired. Washington, you're fired.
[53:08.720 --> 53:12.400]  I think it's the next freedom to fascism. Washington, you're fired, was born out
[53:12.400 --> 53:15.200]  of sheer frustration with abuses in our current political system,
[53:15.200 --> 53:18.800]  and it gives a voice to Americans across the country. Washington, you're fired,
[53:18.800 --> 53:22.160]  examines constitutional issues as they relate to the Katrina disaster,
[53:22.160 --> 53:26.480]  the president's illegal spy program, NSA data mining, FISA secret court,
[53:26.480 --> 53:29.920]  the illegal wiretapping of millions of Americans, and the last seven years of
[53:29.920 --> 53:33.760]  terror-related spy bills, how they affect you, and what you can do about it.
[53:33.760 --> 53:37.040]  Washington, you're fired, captures the spirit and zest of an old-fashioned
[53:37.040 --> 53:40.080]  Boston Tea Party. Kim Williams describes the film as a
[53:40.080 --> 53:43.840]  rabble-rousing call to arms. We invite you to make the change with us.
[53:43.840 --> 53:47.200]  Help take back our government now. Go to takebackwashington.com
[53:47.200 --> 53:50.640]  and get the video tools you need for the information war. We have a plan to take
[53:50.640 --> 54:04.880]  back our government. Please visit takebackwashington.com.
[54:04.880 --> 54:08.480]  Okay, final segment with Congressman Ron Paul.
[54:08.480 --> 54:13.360]  He's from an amazing campaign. The Trilateral Commission is very upset. We
[54:13.360 --> 54:18.320]  have that from a great source, and I've talked to top globalists myself who
[54:18.320 --> 54:20.720]  are very upset about what I'm doing, and I'm
[54:20.720 --> 54:24.880]  small fish compared to Congressman Ron Paul, who now really is our champion,
[54:24.880 --> 54:28.240]  champion of the Constitution, and we've got a commending.
[54:28.240 --> 54:31.200]  Just real fast before we get into the Obama thing in your book,
[54:31.200 --> 54:34.480]  to be clear, because I've said I support taking over the delegates to control
[54:34.480 --> 54:39.360]  the party charters and the platform and to take over the party machinery,
[54:39.360 --> 54:42.400]  but I kept getting from your letters and your statements that, you know, if
[54:42.400 --> 54:46.400]  somebody is a delegate pledged for McCain or if somebody is a delegate for
[54:46.400 --> 54:49.200]  that vote, you've got to go with that, because the media would
[54:49.200 --> 54:53.680]  crucify us, A, like we were trying to steal an election, and B, you had said
[54:53.680 --> 54:57.200]  that you wanted to honor the delegate process. People said no, no, no, Ron Paul
[54:57.200 --> 55:00.480]  hadn't said that. There's a large camp in the delegate process
[55:00.480 --> 55:05.280]  that do intense some type of takeover, which of course will be
[55:05.280 --> 55:08.560]  stopped from the top, and then I think will be a propaganda nightmare for us.
[55:08.560 --> 55:12.240]  Do you have any comments on that? Yeah, I mean, that's not going to happen, but
[55:12.240 --> 55:16.160]  that doesn't mean that people who are delegates and alternates shouldn't go,
[55:16.160 --> 55:19.200]  or at the grassroots, they should continue to do what they're doing. We still
[55:19.200 --> 55:22.240]  are going to have our Texas convention. We're going to have a presence there,
[55:22.240 --> 55:26.240]  and they're going to be involved, and they're going to try to, you know,
[55:26.240 --> 55:29.760]  influence the platform and do all the things that they should,
[55:29.760 --> 55:34.800]  because, you know, there is a future, and if they don't have the numbers now,
[55:34.800 --> 55:37.760]  they're going to get them later, but they should be running for precinct leader,
[55:37.760 --> 55:42.400]  or whatever they want to do to continue this activity,
[55:42.400 --> 55:46.160]  but to think that we're going to go over in some sneaky way
[55:46.160 --> 55:50.960]  take over the national convention, or totally control the Texas convention,
[55:50.960 --> 55:54.000]  I mean, we have to be realistic, but that doesn't mean we
[55:54.000 --> 55:57.520]  shouldn't do what we're doing, and we won't have, we could very well have a
[55:57.520 --> 56:01.280]  great deal of influence, but ultimately the real influence
[56:01.280 --> 56:04.480]  are our numbers, and the strength of our message, and winning the hearts of
[56:04.480 --> 56:07.120]  a lot of people. And spreading. Every Ron Paul supporter, every
[56:07.120 --> 56:10.320]  lever of liberty has to wake up two or three people in the next month, and have
[56:10.320 --> 56:13.680]  them wake up other folks. Barack Obama, McCain, Hillary, give me your
[56:13.680 --> 56:17.920]  take on that, Congressman. Well, there's really no choice there,
[56:17.920 --> 56:22.080]  at all. They all belong to the same group. They all belong to the,
[56:22.080 --> 56:26.720]  you know, they're beholden to the military industrial complex, and the
[56:26.720 --> 56:30.720]  medical industry, the media industry. I mean, the whole work, the banking
[56:30.720 --> 56:33.920]  industry, nothing is different. The rhetoric is different, and they
[56:33.920 --> 56:36.640]  peel different ways. They're all after power,
[56:36.640 --> 56:39.840]  but there's not going to be a whole lot of difference. Now, if I had, if I didn't
[56:39.840 --> 56:43.120]  know anybody's name, I'd just listen to what they said.
[56:43.120 --> 56:46.720]  I would say on foreign policy, Obama probably
[56:46.720 --> 56:51.920]  sounds more reasonable. But, you know, I know who he is. I know what he believes
[56:51.920 --> 56:57.040]  in, and so I don't, you know, believe if we have an Obama
[56:57.040 --> 56:59.520]  presidency, all of a sudden we're going to have a more sensible foreign
[56:59.520 --> 57:03.440]  policy. The same forces will have their, have their control.
[57:03.440 --> 57:07.200]  So I think that's not where the argument should be. The argument has to be,
[57:07.200 --> 57:10.800]  do we want to continue the politics of those three individuals,
[57:10.800 --> 57:14.800]  or do we want to change the country? Do we want to restore the Constitution?
[57:14.800 --> 57:18.000]  Do we want sound money? Do we want to challenge the whole system?
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.880]  And that, of course, is what the revolution is all about.
[57:20.880 --> 57:24.880]  So you would say that Obama is a false or fake
[57:24.880 --> 57:28.960]  revolution. He's talking about change, but change with socialized health care
[57:28.960 --> 57:32.400]  and more government. You know, he, he is, and it's interesting
[57:32.400 --> 57:36.240]  that he does appeal to some of the very same people we appeal to,
[57:36.240 --> 57:40.080]  uh, because he wants to have change. But has he been very specific? Does he talk
[57:40.080 --> 57:43.520]  about non-intervention foreign policy, or sound money, or attacking the
[57:43.520 --> 57:47.680]  military industrial complex, bringing the troops home, balancing the budget?
[57:47.680 --> 57:52.160]  No, not of that, but still superficially, when people hear him,
[57:52.160 --> 57:55.920]  they'll say, oh yeah, he's different. He's going to have changes,
[57:55.920 --> 57:59.920]  and he sounds something like Ron Paul, and he has a chance of ongoing with Obama.
[57:59.920 --> 58:03.040]  Congressman, the new book is The Revolution of Manifesto,
[58:03.040 --> 58:06.800]  bestseller available at infowars.com right now. In closing, who do you think
[58:06.800 --> 58:09.360]  McCain's running may be, and who do you think the ticket's going to be on the
[58:09.360 --> 58:12.800]  Democratic side? Well, my guess is no better than anybody
[58:12.800 --> 58:16.160]  else's, but maybe he'll end up picking Huckabee to try to,
[58:16.160 --> 58:20.320]  you know, solidify the Christian right, uh, those supporters of the war.
[58:20.320 --> 58:23.600]  And then Obama, Hillary? Right, you've learned a war.
[58:23.600 --> 58:27.120]  And then Obama, Hillary on the other side? Oh, Obama, I still think that they are
[58:27.120 --> 58:29.680]  going to be inclined maybe to put Hillary on the ticket, or
[58:29.680 --> 58:35.920]  Edward. I don't know. Congressman, thank you so much.
[58:35.920 --> 58:42.800]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:44.160 --> 58:50.160]  It is a big idea, a new world order. In the near future,
[58:50.160 --> 58:53.280]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[58:53.280 --> 58:58.880]  It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world domination?
[58:58.880 --> 59:02.080]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[59:02.080 --> 59:06.240]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream
[59:06.240 --> 59:12.400]  of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[59:12.400 --> 59:16.320]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government
[59:16.320 --> 59:20.160]  is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire
[59:20.160 --> 59:23.600]  New World Order agenda. Bilderberg is making great progress for the
[59:23.600 --> 59:25.840]  world government. Most people have no idea they're not
[59:25.840 --> 59:29.760]  after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.
[59:29.760 --> 59:34.400]  Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com,
[59:34.400 --> 59:38.400]  or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[59:38.400 --> 59:58.000]  In-game, blueprint for global enslaved. You have been warned.
[59:58.000 --> 1:00:01.360]  Government cover-ups. You want answers?
[1:00:01.360 --> 1:00:07.120]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[1:00:07.120 --> 1:00:13.520]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:13.520 --> 1:00:16.720]  Well, that was an amazing interview with congressman Ron Paul. He'll be at
[1:00:16.720 --> 1:00:21.600]  Book People this evening. Seven o'clock downtown Austin off of
[1:00:21.600 --> 1:00:26.400]  South Lamar by the giant Gantor.
[1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:30.080]  World headquarters of Whole Foods. I wish I could go to that. I'll be doing a
[1:00:30.080 --> 1:00:34.000]  live TV show tonight, and I wish I was invited to a private
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:37.040]  meeting with Ron Paul and local Austin supporters, but I will not be going to
[1:00:37.040 --> 1:00:40.800]  that. But he did invite some of my staff along, so I'm going to be
[1:00:40.800 --> 1:00:44.320]  sending Aaron over there to do an interview with him at the end of it.
[1:00:44.320 --> 1:00:47.680]  As he goes through the Ganttload or whatever is going on there. So we'll
[1:00:47.680 --> 1:00:50.720]  also have a little TV thing for you. We'll get up in the next few days at
[1:00:50.720 --> 1:00:53.440]  prisonplanet.tv, and then it can be sent out to the
[1:00:53.440 --> 1:00:57.040]  Four Wins over the web. That's what happens. Prisonplanet.tv
[1:00:57.040 --> 1:01:00.480]  members get it in super high quality, and then we appreciate you spreading into
[1:01:00.480 --> 1:01:06.560]  the Four Wins, because that is our goal, is waking people up.
[1:01:06.560 --> 1:01:09.920]  Before I go any further, I am trying to capitalize
[1:01:09.920 --> 1:01:14.800]  my operation so I can hire more people. And before I do that, because I'm in a
[1:01:14.800 --> 1:01:19.840]  2,300 square foot converted repair shop, I'm literally in a
[1:01:19.840 --> 1:01:24.400]  three-room shack. People, it's from the old west. You drive by it. It looks like an
[1:01:24.400 --> 1:01:27.760]  old west set. It's not. It was built in 1920s.
[1:01:27.760 --> 1:01:31.040]  And let me tell you, people literally think they're going to see Matt Dillon
[1:01:31.040 --> 1:01:34.240]  out front where I'm at. It's a nice place, but we've grown out of it.
[1:01:34.240 --> 1:01:36.880]  But we're going to need a lot of money to do this, because I'm not going to just go
[1:01:36.880 --> 1:01:39.840]  into something a little bit bigger. I'm going to move into something a
[1:01:39.840 --> 1:01:44.400]  lot bigger so I can do what I need to do. And I'm going to start a TV show
[1:01:44.400 --> 1:01:47.280]  that's going to be on the web that's high quality. Then we're going to beta test it
[1:01:47.280 --> 1:01:50.960]  quickly, moving on to probably five nights a week on
[1:01:50.960 --> 1:01:53.920]  Dish Network or something along those lines. We're looking at that
[1:01:53.920 --> 1:01:57.200]  because we have the buzz. We have the listeners to create something new,
[1:01:57.200 --> 1:02:01.440]  kind of like Democracy Now. But it's going to take a lot of capital to do that.
[1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:05.360]  And you know I don't just shoot my mouth off or talk about pie in the sky
[1:02:05.360 --> 1:02:08.320]  or sell blue sky here. I always do what I say I'm going to do.
[1:02:08.320 --> 1:02:12.800]  That's why it's a huge commitment for me, but I need the financial backup here.
[1:02:12.800 --> 1:02:15.360]  All I think about is fighting the New World Order. All I think about is how to
[1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:18.720]  bring them down. All I think about is waking up my fellow Americans.
[1:02:18.720 --> 1:02:23.040]  All I think about is waking up the world. And I can frankly think of no one out
[1:02:23.040 --> 1:02:28.080]  there who deserves the financial support more than my operation and my great crew.
[1:02:28.080 --> 1:02:31.520]  And I can think of nowhere where there's a bigger punch for your dollar, bigger bang
[1:02:31.520 --> 1:02:34.640]  for your buck. So buy the DVDs. Buy
[1:02:34.640 --> 1:02:39.200]  Loose Change Final Cut. Buy Endgame. Buy Police State 3 The Takeover.
[1:02:39.200 --> 1:02:44.800]  Buy Terror Storm. Buy American Drug War. Washington You're Fired. All the DVDs,
[1:02:44.800 --> 1:02:48.000]  the books, the materials that we sell at infowars.com,
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:51.440]  at the secure online video and bookstore shopping cart.
[1:02:51.440 --> 1:02:56.240]  infowars.com. That's how we pay for it. That's how we do it.
[1:02:56.240 --> 1:02:59.360]  And plus they're the best films that we carry for the others have made and then
[1:02:59.360 --> 1:03:04.000]  my 18 films. This is how we get the word out.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:08.800]  Prismplanet.tv 15 cents a day. So we can put out really high quality

[1:03:22.960 --> 1:03:27.600]  and our revenues stayed the same. That tells you how bad the economy is.
[1:03:27.600 --> 1:03:30.960]  Our measurable audience has doubled in the last year and our income has stayed the
[1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:33.360]  same. And I'd like to be able to give my
[1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:35.760]  employees a little bit of a raise because the dollar is being devalued now
[1:03:35.760 --> 1:03:38.320]  domestically. First it happened internationally. And I know you'd like
[1:03:38.320 --> 1:03:41.600]  one too. I understand that. I'm saying support us if you want
[1:03:41.600 --> 1:03:44.960]  us to not just be here but expand and go to the next level.
[1:03:44.960 --> 1:03:47.920]  Which I'm not putting my whole life into this. I'm not putting it all on the line
[1:03:47.920 --> 1:03:52.240]  for nothing. So infowars.com to go to the secure

[1:04:05.040 --> 1:04:09.680]  up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com. I didn't start plugging this till
[1:04:09.680 --> 1:04:14.000]  really last Thursday or Friday. We got a lot of pledges on there and we
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:16.800]  could do so much. I mean we're as good a place to give
[1:04:16.800 --> 1:04:21.280]  money as Ron Paul. And in the long run, you know, it's
[1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:24.160]  probably even better if you want to get down to Bryce tax and just be honest
[1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:29.040]  about it. Because I will take 100% of that money and I will
[1:04:29.040 --> 1:04:32.160]  shoot it straight into the heart of the New World Order. I will fire black
[1:04:32.160 --> 1:04:36.240]  arrows right into the New World Order in the info war. I will
[1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:41.200]  expand what we're doing and you know as an attack frigate we have
[1:04:41.200 --> 1:04:45.840]  absolutely wreaked havoc on the enemy. I want to go up to giant floating fortress
[1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:51.040]  level so we can really bombard their main capital cities in the info war.
[1:04:51.040 --> 1:04:55.360]  Terror storm, a history of government sponsored terror. Loose change, final cut.
[1:04:55.360 --> 1:04:58.560]  End game blueprint for global enslavement. The true story of the

[1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:06.160]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books

[1:05:53.280 --> 1:05:56.560]  our drinking water and did you know that you have greater exposure to these
[1:05:56.560 --> 1:06:00.320]  chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water? That's because
[1:06:00.320 --> 1:06:03.920]  many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into
[1:06:03.920 --> 1:06:07.200]  the skin. The KDF dual media shower filter works
[1:06:07.200 --> 1:06:10.560]  with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine,
[1:06:10.560 --> 1:06:14.400]  lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria,
[1:06:14.400 --> 1:06:19.680]  mold, algae and fungus. The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000
[1:06:19.680 --> 1:06:23.760]  gallons or one year whichever comes first. Hospitals, restaurants and water
[1:06:23.760 --> 1:06:27.520]  treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and
[1:06:27.520 --> 1:06:30.560]  bacteria. What about you? Order your KDF shower

[1:06:59.040 --> 1:07:03.360]  fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of
[1:07:03.360 --> 1:07:06.800]  which are synthetic. Hi, this is Alex Jones. I was shocked when I
[1:07:06.800 --> 1:07:10.320]  discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing,
[1:07:10.320 --> 1:07:14.000]  wheezing and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin

[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:56.080]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines,
[1:07:56.080 --> 1:08:14.880]  the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:14.880 --> 1:08:18.720]  Well, Henry Macal's a PhD, was born in Zurich, Switzerland.
[1:08:18.720 --> 1:08:22.080]  He's a Canadian quote conspiracy theorist. This is Wikipedia.
[1:08:22.080 --> 1:08:25.520]  That means he reads Carnegie Endowment and Rockefeller Endowment documents
[1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:27.440]  where they said they'd break up the family and
[1:08:27.440 --> 1:08:31.840]  and, you know, best-selling books written by the father of modern
[1:08:31.840 --> 1:08:35.040]  advertising and propaganda, Edward Bernays, about how they engineered the
[1:08:35.040 --> 1:08:38.080]  feminist movement. It doesn't matter if they all admit it. Wikipedia just calls
[1:08:38.080 --> 1:08:41.040]  him a conspiracy theorist. He's the inventor of the board game
[1:08:41.040 --> 1:08:44.480]  Scruples. I guess that's a conspiracy theory too. Maybe that doesn't exist either.
[1:08:44.480 --> 1:08:47.040]  Kind of like the Transnafta Highway. They're building right down the road from
[1:08:47.040 --> 1:08:50.960]  me. A few miles doesn't exist. And the author of A Long Way to Go for a
[1:08:50.960 --> 1:08:55.680]  date. He's also written a another book called Cruel Hoax Feminism in the New
[1:08:55.680 --> 1:09:00.000]  World Order. And we've got a link to his website up
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:06.160]  on infowars.com right now. SaveTheMales.ca.
[1:09:06.160 --> 1:09:08.960]  And he's broken a really big story the last few weeks about
[1:09:08.960 --> 1:09:12.800]  concentration camp extermination centers of Native Americans
[1:09:12.800 --> 1:09:16.160]  up in Canada. And this merges with all that I know about it
[1:09:16.160 --> 1:09:19.120]  when George Bush Sr. ran just one of many programs before he went around the
[1:09:19.120 --> 1:09:24.400]  eugenics program in China. He publicly on these facilities got 44%
[1:09:24.400 --> 1:09:28.720]  of the women sterilized in just four years of running the program.
[1:09:28.720 --> 1:09:32.640]  I mean these things are death camps and that's what the inner cities are.
[1:09:32.640 --> 1:09:35.760]  That's what the projects have been to break up the family.
[1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:38.560]  Hey we'll give you money not to have a man in the house. Then within one
[1:09:38.560 --> 1:09:44.240]  generation they go from 90% legitimacy to 93% illegitimacy
[1:09:44.240 --> 1:09:48.320]  and total unraveling of society. All scientifically crafted but this
[1:09:48.320 --> 1:09:51.440]  particular story because I was setting up Macal last week and my producer was
[1:09:51.440 --> 1:09:54.240]  going he wants to have this other guy on. Then I finally looked at the story and
[1:09:54.240 --> 1:09:58.160]  it's like wow meshes with all the intel I've got but even worse
[1:09:58.160 --> 1:10:00.960]  how the extermination ops are going on right now.
[1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:05.360]  Your government is completely psychopathic and criminal waging scientific
[1:10:05.360 --> 1:10:09.440]  social engineering warfare on you. And that goes for you too cops and
[1:10:09.440 --> 1:10:13.520]  bureaucrats that serve the system. We're all in a red level emergency. We're in a
[1:10:13.520 --> 1:10:17.920]  false reality, a false engineered reality. We better break out of it right now
[1:10:17.920 --> 1:10:20.960]  and a good way to do it is with Henry Macal who woke up to feminism and I
[1:10:20.960 --> 1:10:24.960]  wanted him to talk about in a nutshell how it started, why the elites did it,
[1:10:24.960 --> 1:10:28.640]  how they wanted both people working so the state could have the kids and
[1:10:28.640 --> 1:10:31.760]  how they've done that and how in the name of feminism they've turned women into
[1:10:31.760 --> 1:10:36.320]  absolute sexual objects that and the men are cowardly chicken-necked
[1:10:36.320 --> 1:10:40.800]  fools. I mean I'm not just attacking the women. I look at men. They act tough but
[1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:45.040]  they're not tough and they don't have moral courage. They're lazy
[1:10:45.040 --> 1:10:49.040]  and they're so cowardly they let women boss them around. No woman's happy
[1:10:49.040 --> 1:10:53.600]  when you let her boss you around. I mean that's just how
[1:10:53.600 --> 1:10:56.560]  women are built. They want you to be nice to them, take care of them.
[1:10:56.560 --> 1:11:00.480]  They can have 180 IQ. They still want somebody
[1:11:00.480 --> 1:11:04.640]  to take care of them and you know that's what it comes down to.
[1:11:04.640 --> 1:11:08.560]  I mean they want somebody who basically is going to be their daddy
[1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:12.000]  and you know boy they get mad when you say that but that's what they want.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:16.160]  Let's go to Dr. McCow. Mr. McCow thank you for coming on with us.
[1:11:16.160 --> 1:11:20.480]  My pleasure Alex. The message I want to get across to your listeners because
[1:11:20.480 --> 1:11:23.840]  I'm not often on your show and I don't often read your listeners
[1:11:23.840 --> 1:11:27.760]  is that they're essentially social engineering us
[1:11:27.760 --> 1:11:33.040]  to be like homosexuals. They're basically trying to break up
[1:11:33.040 --> 1:11:37.360]  heterosexuality, undermine it and make us like homosexuals.
[1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:41.520]  Now it's really strange when we have to wake up to the fact that we are the
[1:11:41.520 --> 1:11:47.920]  subjects in someone else's laboratory. We are being worked on and we've been
[1:11:47.920 --> 1:11:52.320]  worked on for the last 50 years. They use science, they use culture,
[1:11:52.320 --> 1:11:56.800]  they use the government and they use advertising
[1:11:56.800 --> 1:12:00.720]  and they're constantly giving us messages that are undermining our
[1:12:00.720 --> 1:12:04.800]  heterosexual nature, attacking gender that's masculinity and
[1:12:04.800 --> 1:12:08.240]  femininity. And we're not attacking other groups and
[1:12:08.240 --> 1:12:11.680]  what they're into the point is they're attacking us. The state is
[1:12:11.680 --> 1:12:15.680]  and you watch the cartoons, the dramas, the man is an idiot, he's a moron,
[1:12:15.680 --> 1:12:19.040]  the women are the boss and this is the same thing as bringing the black women
[1:12:19.040 --> 1:12:21.760]  in the house where they could read, write and run things and then they would
[1:12:21.760 --> 1:12:26.480]  enslave the black men out in the pen. That's right all this business about
[1:12:26.480 --> 1:12:30.720]  respecting homosexuals and tolerance that's just a cover
[1:12:30.720 --> 1:12:35.520]  for a vicious, vicious attack on the vast majority
[1:12:35.520 --> 1:12:40.400]  and it's being done for political reasons to basically incapacitate us
[1:12:40.400 --> 1:12:44.480]  so we'll accept, so we'll be dysfunctional so we can be brainwashed
[1:12:44.480 --> 1:12:48.080]  easier and we can be... So we can be CPS so they can take our
[1:12:48.080 --> 1:12:51.040]  children and do what they do to the natives, exterminate us so they can
[1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:54.880]  break up our family so we won't have the will to fight as tribal warriors who
[1:12:54.880 --> 1:12:58.400]  are meant to defend the family. They're destroying the nuclei of the
[1:12:58.400 --> 1:13:02.080]  family which is the human species. Men and women were all connected, our
[1:13:02.080 --> 1:13:05.920]  children, we are the species together to say that we're separate as a fraud. Go
[1:13:05.920 --> 1:13:11.440]  ahead. Well, exactly, no. When I tell people that
[1:13:11.440 --> 1:13:14.960]  we're being re-engineered to be homosexuals, they just turn off.
[1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:18.640]  They think, well hey, I don't like the opposite sex, what are you talking about?
[1:13:18.640 --> 1:13:22.880]  It doesn't matter anymore whether we have sex with the same sex
[1:13:22.880 --> 1:13:26.000]  opposite sex. It's the whole metrosexual thing. It's
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:29.840]  men aren't leaders, they're not hard chargers, they're upset about how they
[1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:33.680]  look, they nanny. The fact is that homosexuals,
[1:13:33.680 --> 1:13:36.800]  they don't get married, they don't want to get married despite all the
[1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:40.800]  publicity that's being given to that. Homosexuals don't want to get married,
[1:13:40.800 --> 1:13:44.400]  they don't want to have children and all they want to do is have sex
[1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:48.560]  and guess what, look around at heterosexuals, that's what's happening.
[1:13:48.560 --> 1:13:54.720]  If you define homosexuality as gender identity disorder, resulting in
[1:13:54.720 --> 1:13:59.680]  arrested development because you cannot bond permanently with a member of the
[1:13:59.680 --> 1:14:03.680]  opposite sex, that's us. That's heterosexuals
[1:14:03.680 --> 1:14:08.560]  these days. We can't bond permanently and this is
[1:14:08.560 --> 1:14:13.040]  the reason that we're having pornography pushed at us
[1:14:13.040 --> 1:14:17.760]  because they just want us to have sex but they don't want us to have families.
[1:14:17.760 --> 1:14:23.920]  Go ahead, sir, continue. Well, it's all, you know, it's so
[1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:28.160]  pervasive, it's just ridiculous, like two of the latest advertisements I've
[1:14:28.160 --> 1:14:33.280]  seen, one is a Dairy Queen ad where a little girl
[1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:37.120]  and her mother are in a Dairy Queen, she says just order one
[1:14:37.120 --> 1:14:40.880]  and she's picked out some pigeon, some guy who, a little boy who
[1:14:40.880 --> 1:14:45.360]  was flirting with her and then, sure enough, the boy buys her
[1:14:45.360 --> 1:14:49.360]  a Sunday so mom only had to buy one for herself. It's about the manipulation of
[1:14:49.360 --> 1:14:53.120]  the dumb males, yes. Yeah, and then the little girl
[1:14:53.120 --> 1:14:56.160]  says, it's like shooting fish in a barrel.
[1:14:56.160 --> 1:15:00.720]  Come on, what kind of values are those? They're teaching us and us against
[1:15:00.720 --> 1:15:04.320]  them mentality. When really women, they want to take
[1:15:04.320 --> 1:15:08.160]  men away from you so they can sterilize you and have their way with you.
[1:15:08.160 --> 1:15:11.360]  So when you're dying and your cancer viruses, they've been planted, nobody's
[1:15:11.360 --> 1:15:14.800]  there to help you, go ahead. Right, then there's a wriggly
[1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:18.480]  Spearman gum, a commercial where basically the gum
[1:15:18.480 --> 1:15:22.000]  lasts longer. He gives the bouquet to the girl at the
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:24.240]  door. She runs through the whole sequence of the
[1:15:24.240 --> 1:15:28.240]  relationship and breaks up with him at the door and then
[1:15:28.240 --> 1:15:33.280]  the punchline is, hey, stick to gum, it lasts longer.
[1:15:33.280 --> 1:15:36.960]  Two very recent examples, but there's hundreds of them,
[1:15:36.960 --> 1:15:40.880]  of this constant attack on heterosexual, heterosexuality.
[1:15:40.880 --> 1:15:45.200]  There's an attack on fidelity. There's an attack on unions
[1:15:45.200 --> 1:15:49.360]  and bulwarks and they said 90 years ago and 80 years ago
[1:15:49.360 --> 1:15:52.560]  in the Carnegie Endowment that they had to encourage
[1:15:52.560 --> 1:15:56.640]  relationships that break up, promiscuity,
[1:15:56.640 --> 1:15:59.760]  and that they had to encourage homosexuality to reduce
[1:15:59.760 --> 1:16:05.200]  population numbers. It is a eugenical uprising.
[1:16:05.200 --> 1:16:09.840]  For sure and to justify all this immigration and
[1:16:09.840 --> 1:16:13.760]  and so on. If our populations are down, we have to
[1:16:13.760 --> 1:16:18.080]  have immigration and then the population is totally heterogeneous.
[1:16:18.080 --> 1:16:21.920]  There's no commonality. It's all part of this grand
[1:16:21.920 --> 1:16:26.080]  re-engineering of the human race, which involves
[1:16:26.080 --> 1:16:32.480]  destroying race, religion, family, and the nation.
[1:16:32.480 --> 1:16:35.920]  So they can replace it. So I mean I have the Department of
[1:16:35.920 --> 1:16:37.920]  Education documents. I know you have them as well.
[1:16:37.920 --> 1:16:40.960]  It's all and they have. They've destroyed us. You look at the public.
[1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:44.000]  They are a bunch of dumbed down, don't care about anyone,
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:48.000]  aren't happy because all of their true tribal instincts have been destroyed.
[1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:53.440]  Exactly. And I think Alex, I think we want to look at
[1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:56.880]  who's behind this. You mentioned the Carnegie Endowment.
[1:16:56.880 --> 1:17:01.760]  It's basically the Rockefellers who are basically the nominees for the Rothschild
[1:17:01.760 --> 1:17:07.360]  in the United States. And it's basically the world's central banking cartel
[1:17:07.360 --> 1:17:13.680]  and their allies, which the Masons are their big
[1:17:13.680 --> 1:17:18.880]  important network and organized jewelry is one of their instruments as well.
[1:17:18.880 --> 1:17:22.320]  By the way, you're Jewish and you're saying that.
[1:17:22.320 --> 1:17:26.320]  I'm Jewish and I'm saying that because I'm making the point that most Jews
[1:17:26.320 --> 1:17:29.520]  in my opinion are not, don't believe this is happening
[1:17:29.520 --> 1:17:32.960]  and aren't aware it's happening. They don't realize that organized jewelry
[1:17:32.960 --> 1:17:38.400]  is being run by the central bankers and is pushing the same agenda.
[1:17:38.400 --> 1:17:41.920]  Well, there's no doubt that you have a lot of folks in technology and
[1:17:41.920 --> 1:17:45.600]  in the sciences and Bernays and a lot of others pushing it.
[1:17:45.600 --> 1:17:50.720]  And it's just so completely cold-blooded to see this being done in
[1:17:50.720 --> 1:17:53.440]  society. So we're a more manageable, mindless,
[1:17:53.440 --> 1:17:57.600]  leaderless herd. The point is that these central bankers,
[1:17:57.600 --> 1:18:01.200]  the Rockefellers, using the Rockefeller Foundation,
[1:18:01.200 --> 1:18:07.040]  they've taken over all the institutions in our society.
[1:18:07.040 --> 1:18:12.640]  First of all, the interlocking directorates that they own, they own
[1:18:12.640 --> 1:18:16.480]  most of major corporations or control them. And then
[1:18:16.480 --> 1:18:20.000]  they've taken over the churches. They've taken over the charity.
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:23.840]  And they started it all, World Council, National Council of Churches,
[1:18:23.840 --> 1:18:27.680]  the National Association of Governors. Every major group, you go look, they
[1:18:27.680 --> 1:18:30.400]  founded it. The state police in 33, they got it
[1:18:30.400 --> 1:18:33.680]  chartered as federal police. They run it all folks.
[1:18:33.680 --> 1:18:37.840]  They studied how to put cancer viruses and vaccines in the 20s, all public.
[1:18:37.840 --> 1:18:41.680]  They're the ones running eugenics on you. It's just, it's not
[1:18:41.680 --> 1:18:44.880]  Marish, Henry. That's right. And I think we have to recognize
[1:18:44.880 --> 1:18:49.440]  the fact that this is a satanic cult that has, for
[1:18:49.440 --> 1:18:53.360]  centuries, been wanting to basically take over the human race.
[1:18:53.360 --> 1:18:58.800]  We're under attack from a satanic cult. And the people say, well, what makes them
[1:18:58.800 --> 1:19:03.760]  satanic? It's when, when men decide they're God,
[1:19:03.760 --> 1:19:07.200]  that's when they become satanic. And then on top of it,
[1:19:07.200 --> 1:19:13.280]  they decide that their evil self-interest and their evil perversion
[1:19:13.280 --> 1:19:17.040]  have to be foisted on the human race. And everything that's good
[1:19:17.040 --> 1:19:21.520]  about life and especially love has to be undermined and destroyed.
[1:19:21.520 --> 1:19:25.200]  So we are under attack, under spiritual, political,
[1:19:25.200 --> 1:19:32.560]  economic attack by a satanic cult that holds believers of power
[1:19:32.560 --> 1:19:35.840]  and the economy. Stay there. Stay there. Quick break. We'll come back
[1:19:35.840 --> 1:19:40.960]  back with Henry Macau, PhD, best-selling author, as you know,
[1:19:40.960 --> 1:19:44.400]  one of the makers of the most popular board games as well.
[1:19:44.400 --> 1:19:47.360]  Regardless of you believe in God or not, the globalists do. And they are
[1:19:47.360 --> 1:19:50.960]  worshipers of Lucifer. They're not very friendly.
[1:19:50.960 --> 1:19:55.280]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history
[1:19:55.280 --> 1:19:58.800]  comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut,

[1:20:05.840 --> 1:20:09.280]  catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members

[1:20:12.880 --> 1:20:17.120]  horrendous crime are brought to justice. Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate
[1:20:17.120 --> 1:20:21.440]  9-11 expose. From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to
[1:20:21.440 --> 1:20:25.200]  bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film

[1:21:06.480 --> 1:21:09.680]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax
[1:21:09.680 --> 1:21:12.960]  collections. Now the government has published the document that sounds the
[1:21:12.960 --> 1:21:16.640]  alarm. That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO,
[1:21:16.640 --> 1:21:19.440]  has published the long-term fiscal outlook document,
[1:21:19.440 --> 1:21:22.800]  clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[1:21:22.800 --> 1:21:27.040]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to
[1:21:27.040 --> 1:21:31.040]  ensure bank deposits. Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[1:21:31.040 --> 1:21:35.120]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy. Get this document free by
[1:21:35.120 --> 1:21:40.640]  calling 800-686-2237. The U.S. GAO has spelled it out in black
[1:21:40.640 --> 1:21:46.720]  and white. Call 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[1:21:46.720 --> 1:21:50.800]  800-686-2237.
[1:21:51.600 --> 1:21:55.440]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[1:21:55.440 --> 1:21:59.360]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the
[1:21:59.360 --> 1:22:02.000]  destroyers. The number of the mounted troops was
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:05.840]  200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.,
[1:22:05.840 --> 1:22:08.800]  though the people of the U.S. where their numbers and influence are
[1:22:08.800 --> 1:22:11.920]  strongest have primary responsibility for reining the men and
[1:22:11.920 --> 1:22:15.280]  bringing them to justice. All nations will participate since they
[1:22:15.280 --> 1:22:18.560]  reside the world over. They are called Illuminati,
[1:22:18.560 --> 1:22:23.520]  elite, proponents of the New World Order. They oppose everything that is God and
[1:22:23.520 --> 1:22:26.080]  truth. They are of the line that was disinherited
[1:22:26.080 --> 1:22:30.160]  2,000 years ago, everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they
[1:22:30.160 --> 1:22:34.240]  have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses,
[1:22:34.240 --> 1:22:37.920]  the destruction of the earth and mankind, we will undo through the
[1:22:37.920 --> 1:22:42.160]  authority that has now been delegated to us. Visit our website at

[1:22:48.640 --> 1:22:52.640]  The message of his kingdom. Doctors around the world claim that cancer
[1:22:52.640 --> 1:22:56.400]  and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment.
[1:22:56.400 --> 1:23:00.640]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet and
[1:23:00.640 --> 1:23:03.920]  lack of exercise. pH balance is the foundation of energy
[1:23:03.920 --> 1:23:07.200]  abundance and perfect health as well as prevention of disease.
[1:23:07.200 --> 1:23:11.040]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar,
[1:23:11.040 --> 1:23:15.120]  mental clarity and loss of weight. It was intended for human beings to drink
[1:23:15.120 --> 1:23:18.160]  alkaline water. But due to modern way of life, most people
[1:23:18.160 --> 1:23:21.680]  are overly acidic. The fact is that disease simply cannot exist
[1:23:21.680 --> 1:23:25.040]  in an alkaline environment. Fat accumulates if a person consumes too
[1:23:25.040 --> 1:23:28.000]  much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.

[1:23:57.280 --> 1:24:02.800]  Well I'm not the kind to kiss and tell but I've been seen with Farrah.
[1:24:02.800 --> 1:24:06.800]  I've never been with anything less than a nine.
[1:24:06.800 --> 1:24:10.000]  So fine. I bet the fake feminists don't like this.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:13.760]  Sally failed to pass with a girl named Bo.
[1:24:13.760 --> 1:24:19.120]  But somehow they just don't end up as mine.
[1:24:19.120 --> 1:24:24.720]  It's a death-defying life I lead. I take my chances.
[1:24:24.720 --> 1:24:30.160]  I die for a living in the movies and TV.
[1:24:30.160 --> 1:24:37.040]  But the hardest thing I ever do is watch my leading ladies kiss some other guy
[1:24:37.040 --> 1:24:43.600]  while I'm bandaging my knee. I might fall from a tall building.
[1:24:43.600 --> 1:24:48.320]  I might roll a brand new car because I'm the unknown.
[1:24:48.320 --> 1:24:53.120]  Yeah, they don't want men to be men. They don't want women to be women.
[1:24:53.120 --> 1:24:57.600]  I watch all these feminists 40, 45, 50 clocks ticking. They met a million
[1:24:57.600 --> 1:25:00.960]  dollars. None of them means anything to them. They try to go out and find a man,
[1:25:00.960 --> 1:25:04.960]  have kids. They usually can't by them. Or they
[1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:07.920]  drive off their first three or four husbands. Some of them wake up and then
[1:25:07.920 --> 1:25:10.880]  find out that they don't want to dominate their man.
[1:25:10.880 --> 1:25:13.920]  And then they finally are happy but most of them aren't. They get more and more
[1:25:13.920 --> 1:25:16.560]  bitter, more and more man-hating, more and more crazy.
[1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:20.320]  When they're just chopping off their own nose for their own face. Now the
[1:25:20.320 --> 1:25:23.280]  globalists have also turned men into lazy animals. The
[1:25:23.280 --> 1:25:28.400]  programings work that way too. You know, women are shown the
[1:25:28.400 --> 1:25:32.640]  male on the Fox TV shows who's an idiot moron and he gets all the girls.
[1:25:32.640 --> 1:25:36.240]  Then the young males go out and act like idiot morons and don't get the girls.
[1:25:36.240 --> 1:25:38.880]  Or they get girls that think that's what they're supposed to get but then it
[1:25:38.880 --> 1:25:43.600]  doesn't satisfy them for some reason. All scientifically done. We're all in
[1:25:43.600 --> 1:25:48.160]  this together. In fact, Henry McCow, PhD, SaveTheMales.ca,
[1:25:48.160 --> 1:25:50.880]  you're not saying it's in us against them. You're saying
[1:25:50.880 --> 1:25:54.320]  that's a fraud. That's a lie. That's a false paradigm.
[1:25:54.320 --> 1:25:58.880]  Break that down for us. Well, young women have been betrayed
[1:25:58.880 --> 1:26:01.840]  of big time. They're being betrayed by their teachers,
[1:26:01.840 --> 1:26:05.200]  by their government, by society in general.
[1:26:05.200 --> 1:26:11.600]  And I mean, women have about 10 years to make their deal at most.
[1:26:11.600 --> 1:26:15.040]  You know, 17 to 27. That's when they're attracted to men.
[1:26:15.040 --> 1:26:18.080]  And after that, it's Stephen Slippery's
[1:26:18.080 --> 1:26:22.080]  plope. Women are, you know, men are attracted to women
[1:26:22.080 --> 1:26:25.200]  who are at the height of their fertility. That's nature.
[1:26:25.200 --> 1:26:29.120]  And these Luciferians, they want to rewrite nature and pretend that women
[1:26:29.120 --> 1:26:32.640]  in their 40s and 50s are attractive to men. Physically, they're not.
[1:26:32.640 --> 1:26:36.640]  By that time, men and women will have been married 20
[1:26:36.640 --> 1:26:40.240]  years or more and they have established a strong bond
[1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:43.040]  based on other things. And they've had enough sex
[1:26:43.040 --> 1:26:46.240]  that there are other more important things in life. So sexual attraction
[1:26:46.240 --> 1:26:49.360]  doesn't matter. So the women who are... Yeah, it's now a family.
[1:26:49.360 --> 1:26:52.160]  It's about taking care of the children that are in college. It's about,
[1:26:52.160 --> 1:26:56.560]  it's about the family. Exactly. I mean, they brainwashed us to think
[1:26:56.560 --> 1:26:59.120]  that sex is necessary and blah, blah, blah.
[1:26:59.120 --> 1:27:03.040]  You know, it's, you know, Andy Warhol says the biggest nothing there is.
[1:27:03.040 --> 1:27:06.640]  It's only becomes an issue if you don't get it and they're making sure we,
[1:27:06.640 --> 1:27:11.040]  you know, we don't because we're, you know, or we're obsessed with it because we
[1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:14.640]  don't... Yeah, they somehow taught women that it's something they dangle
[1:27:14.640 --> 1:27:17.200]  out to men and know all men have done is gone and
[1:27:17.200 --> 1:27:20.960]  got into porn, which they actually study show, then actually destroys your
[1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:24.960]  sexual desire. Sure. I mean, it makes you sick of women
[1:27:24.960 --> 1:27:28.880]  and sick of sex. But the bottom line is that women
[1:27:28.880 --> 1:27:33.040]  have been betrayed and men have got to somehow reeducate young
[1:27:33.040 --> 1:27:38.160]  women to realize that they have to make their
[1:27:38.160 --> 1:27:41.520]  deals, establish a family while they're in their 20s.
[1:27:41.520 --> 1:27:47.200]  And that this is a big advice to men is right from the start. You've
[1:27:47.200 --> 1:27:50.960]  got to establish that you're the boss. And of course, before you do that,
[1:27:50.960 --> 1:27:54.400]  you've got to be worthy of that responsibility. So you have to...
[1:27:54.400 --> 1:27:57.520]  Well, let me just say this, women, you don't like the man,
[1:27:57.520 --> 1:28:01.360]  you know, being who you defer to and on some issues.
[1:28:01.360 --> 1:28:04.240]  Well, you're just going to be fighting all the time and now the state is your
[1:28:04.240 --> 1:28:07.760]  boss. I mean, do you want a man or do you want the state?
[1:28:07.760 --> 1:28:11.200]  Absolutely. Do you want someone who loves you and is devoted to life?
[1:28:11.200 --> 1:28:14.080]  Willing to devote his life to you or do you want the state who really doesn't
[1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:17.200]  give a shit or some corporate... Hey, Doc, we can't talk like that. I'm gonna
[1:28:17.200 --> 1:28:19.840]  have to let you go if you do that again, okay? Okay.
[1:28:19.840 --> 1:28:23.680]  All right. Just one more. I'm serious. Okay. You can't do that. This is actual
[1:28:23.680 --> 1:28:27.120]  radio. This is one of those tanker toy play radio networks, okay?
[1:28:27.120 --> 1:28:29.840]  Okay. I'm not mad at you. Just don't do it again. Go ahead.
[1:28:29.840 --> 1:28:32.720]  Okay. Well, anyway, or do you want the corporate, you know, you want your
[1:28:32.720 --> 1:28:38.320]  corporate boss to be responsible for your life?
[1:28:38.320 --> 1:28:42.880]  So, the key is that men have been turned into
[1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:46.560]  women. Essentially, they've managed to disempower
[1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:50.880]  men by empowering women. It's like a seesaw.
[1:28:50.880 --> 1:28:54.400]  The way men are empowered is when women defer to men.
[1:28:54.400 --> 1:28:58.880]  Women are designed to empower men. Men are designed to use that power
[1:28:58.880 --> 1:29:03.920]  to protect women. But when they empower women,
[1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:08.480]  men aren't designed to compete and fight with women. And men just
[1:29:08.480 --> 1:29:14.720]  essentially, they get emasculated. Well, they retreat into the trappings of
[1:29:14.720 --> 1:29:17.680]  masculinity, some of them do, or they retreat into
[1:29:17.680 --> 1:29:21.440]  femininity. Stay there, Dr. Henry McCowley. I really appreciate you
[1:29:21.440 --> 1:29:27.200]  coming on with us. And the website is SaveTheMales.ca.
[1:29:27.200 --> 1:29:29.760]  Really interesting research you've done. Let's get more into the history of
[1:29:29.760 --> 1:29:33.280]  feminism. You're a researcher on it. I've been jumping in a lot because
[1:29:33.280 --> 1:29:37.040]  everything he's saying is so true. And then we'll continue and get some
[1:29:37.040 --> 1:29:41.120]  into the research he's been doing on how they're still killing Native Americans.
[1:29:41.120 --> 1:29:44.960]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[1:29:44.960 --> 1:29:50.080]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:51.280 --> 1:29:57.360]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future,
[1:29:57.360 --> 1:30:03.280]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government. It's known as the Bilderberg.
[1:30:03.280 --> 1:30:07.680]  But their objective being world domination. For thousands of years, their
[1:30:07.680 --> 1:30:11.200]  dark order grew. Now, as they hail the birth of the
[1:30:11.200 --> 1:30:15.280]  new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[1:30:15.280 --> 1:30:18.800]  of humanity is at hand.
[1:30:19.600 --> 1:30:23.520]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government
[1:30:23.520 --> 1:30:27.680]  is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world
[1:30:27.680 --> 1:30:30.800]  order agenda. Bilderberg is making great progress for the
[1:30:30.800 --> 1:30:33.040]  world government. Most people have no idea. They're not
[1:30:33.040 --> 1:30:36.080]  after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their

[1:30:53.040 --> 1:30:57.120]  Americans are victims of identity theft each year. The crime of identity theft
[1:30:57.120 --> 1:31:00.160]  occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an
[1:31:00.160 --> 1:31:03.840]  average of $8,000. If you own a PC, passwords are a common

[1:32:55.520 --> 1:33:00.880]  You have been trained subliminally to hate women. Women have been trained to hate men
[1:33:00.880 --> 1:33:04.080]  that we're competing with each other. It's completely unnatural.
[1:33:04.080 --> 1:33:13.680]  Our women are honored. Our women are the sinners of the family.
[1:33:16.080 --> 1:33:20.240]  And women always instinctively have understood that they are the center of the family.
[1:33:20.800 --> 1:33:25.360]  And they've got to support their men. Now in rare cases you've got drunks or scum and
[1:33:25.360 --> 1:33:29.600]  the society falls apart more and more. But used to this woman would have brothers and family
[1:33:29.600 --> 1:33:32.640]  who wouldn't put up with that. And occasionally things broke up and happened bad.
[1:33:32.640 --> 1:33:37.120]  But we've gone from 90-plus percent legitimacy to now over half illegitimacy.
[1:33:37.760 --> 1:33:40.560]  And Henry McCow is our guest. Some of the other news in front of us today.
[1:33:41.440 --> 1:33:45.280]  Warning. Using mobile phones while pregnant can seriously damage your baby.
[1:33:45.840 --> 1:33:51.600]  Another big report there. Iran boss CIA back terror group in the U.S. admits they have al-Qaeda
[1:33:51.600 --> 1:33:56.240]  inside Iran blowing up schools, mosques, killing people. And now they just admitted on the news
[1:33:56.240 --> 1:34:01.040]  neocon general calls for more terror attacks inside Iran. I mean these people are and then
[1:34:01.040 --> 1:34:07.200]  using al-Qaeda while saying that Iran is al-Qaeda. Immigration agency plans new family detention
[1:34:07.200 --> 1:34:10.800]  centers. They want to build camps all over the country. That's just the front for building the
[1:34:10.800 --> 1:34:16.400]  camps. It's really for citizens. And the actual documents admit that. Get into that later. Also
[1:34:16.400 --> 1:34:22.000]  nations. Bush tells the Arabs are running out of oil which isn't true. Obama camp spies in game in
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:26.080]  Oregon. Says we are all eating too much food. The government should regulate our calories.
[1:34:26.080 --> 1:34:30.720]  Everything is going to be micromanaged under the nanny state. It's going to be our mommy.
[1:34:31.280 --> 1:34:35.200]  See, mommies can't be mommies but the state's going to be our mommy.
[1:34:35.200 --> 1:34:39.680]  31,000 scientists rejecting global warming. Man make global warming. Dutch newspapers
[1:34:39.680 --> 1:34:45.840]  as Bilderberg to meet in Washington. June 5th through the 8th. That is just some of the news
[1:34:45.840 --> 1:34:53.440]  we'll be going over. Going back to Henry McCow, PhD. Continue with the history, how this got going
[1:34:53.440 --> 1:35:01.680]  and some of the documentation you've uncovered. Okay, well, you know, if your listeners haven't
[1:35:01.680 --> 1:35:08.240]  read the protocols of Elders Design, they better read them. Because in my opinion, they're genuine.
[1:35:08.880 --> 1:35:17.920]  And they reflect a centuries old plan to take over the world. And essentially, the power behind
[1:35:17.920 --> 1:35:23.920]  this is, as far as I can see, is the central banking cartel. Because they've got our credit cards.
[1:35:23.920 --> 1:35:30.880]  They've got control over our credit, which they use to print money at will. And they have used
[1:35:30.880 --> 1:35:40.800]  that money to basically buy everything and everyone worth buying. So they run, they're behind a
[1:35:40.800 --> 1:35:52.400]  communism. They're behind the Communist Party of the United States. They had Betty Friedan.
[1:35:52.400 --> 1:35:58.240]  Betty Friedan was a communist. She's the founder of Second Wave Feminism. Everything that Second
[1:35:58.240 --> 1:36:05.680]  Wave Feminism pushed for in the sixties, the Communist Party pushed for in the forties and
[1:36:05.680 --> 1:36:12.480]  fifties. And the leaders of Second Wave Feminism were essentially the, these communists are the
[1:36:12.480 --> 1:36:17.920]  daughters of these communists who are known as Red Stocking Babies. And it's the same thing,
[1:36:17.920 --> 1:36:22.960]  or Red Diver Diver Babies. Red Diver Babies, that's right. Yeah, yeah. And it's the same thing
[1:36:22.960 --> 1:36:28.400]  with the neocons. They're all fourth wave Trotskyites, the Communist International.
[1:36:28.400 --> 1:36:31.760]  And that, now understand the bankers created communism. They're not really communists. They
[1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:37.840]  communize our wealth like a mosquito injects a anti-coagulant to suck out your juices.
[1:36:37.840 --> 1:36:43.040]  They communize it, destroy the family and suck it out. My only issue here is I have no doubt that
[1:36:43.040 --> 1:36:47.760]  Zionism is virulent and involving a lot of powerful things in banking and certainly part of it. But
[1:36:47.760 --> 1:36:52.320]  I've really studied the core documents. There's like a merger with that and the Anglo-American
[1:36:52.320 --> 1:36:58.720]  British elite. And then the whole Germanic system is also to regulate and control and carry out
[1:36:58.720 --> 1:37:03.440]  eugenics. I mean, can you explain to me why the Zionists are carrying out a Nazi-style
[1:37:03.440 --> 1:37:06.400]  eugenics policy against blacks, Asians and Latin Americans?
[1:37:07.760 --> 1:37:19.760]  Well, because the central bankers seem to subscribe to elements in religion or possibly
[1:37:19.760 --> 1:37:26.720]  Jewish religion, Kabbalah, and things that may even predate Jewish religion, mystery religions
[1:37:26.720 --> 1:37:32.880]  that are satanic in nature. And they've amalgamated with all the other elites and
[1:37:32.880 --> 1:37:37.040]  couldn't infert, converted them to this Satanism. Well, I mean, that's what I want to be clear
[1:37:37.040 --> 1:37:41.760]  about here is I go where the truth is. Okay. And, you know, we see the Vatican pushing the New
[1:37:41.760 --> 1:37:46.320]  World Order. We see Protestant leaders pushing the New World Order. And obviously we see people
[1:37:46.320 --> 1:37:51.760]  that support, you know, Zionism pushing and at the highest levels. My whole deal is, my whole
[1:37:51.760 --> 1:37:55.520]  deal is, is that there's other people who say, no, it's got to be the Catholics and only the
[1:37:55.520 --> 1:37:58.800]  Catholics. There's people that say, no, it's got to be the Zionists, only the Zionists,
[1:37:58.800 --> 1:38:03.920]  or no, it's got to be the British, only the British. And I'm saying, you know, that it turns
[1:38:03.920 --> 1:38:09.280]  into a contentious issue where we all then just, and we're not doing this, but others, fight over,
[1:38:09.280 --> 1:38:13.840]  well, no, it's only this group in control. And I've done legitimate real study. And I found that
[1:38:13.840 --> 1:38:19.200]  at the top of the pyramid, it's like a bunch of pyramids going together into a super pyramid.
[1:38:19.200 --> 1:38:24.560]  Do you see what I'm saying? Absolutely. And God bless you, Alex. I totally agree with you.
[1:38:24.560 --> 1:38:31.600]  I mean, they have basically co-opted all the elites. And so it's, it's like arguing whether
[1:38:31.600 --> 1:38:38.160]  it's the New York mob or the Chicago mob or the LA mob. It's all the mob. They all belong to the
[1:38:38.160 --> 1:38:45.040]  same satanic cult. And they, they, in a sense, they confuse us by showing us different faces.
[1:38:45.680 --> 1:38:48.000]  But it's the same phenomenon.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:54.240]  Okay. So, but I mean, getting back more into the history of feminism,
[1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:56.400]  talk something about your book about the Cruel Hoax.
[1:38:57.280 --> 1:39:04.480]  Well, the Cruel Hoax essentially contains all my research from the first six years of my website,
[1:39:04.480 --> 1:39:10.080]  including the article, Betty Friedan. Mommy was a commie. And just showing that, you know,
[1:39:10.080 --> 1:39:16.480]  she was a communist, but they, they, essentially they use dupes. They use people who, who are
[1:39:16.480 --> 1:39:21.200]  misguided and actually believe what they're saying. But if, if what they're saying pushes
[1:39:21.200 --> 1:39:26.880]  their agenda, the Illuminati agenda, the bank agenda, then they finance them and they, and
[1:39:26.880 --> 1:39:32.480]  they really hype them up. So, uh, Betty Friedan was, you know, was a dupe. And a dupe is far
[1:39:32.480 --> 1:39:37.520]  more effective than a conscious agent. Because they mean well. Yeah, they mean well. And, and,
[1:39:37.520 --> 1:39:42.800]  and that's what good, those good intentions communicate. Similarly, I think, you know,
[1:39:42.800 --> 1:39:49.120]  possibly Adolf Hitler was a dupe, but let's not go there right now. Okay. Another thing they
[1:39:49.120 --> 1:39:54.880]  control are. Well, there's no, maybe Hitler was a dupe. Lord Milner, the head British Lord,
[1:39:54.880 --> 1:39:59.040]  talked about in the teens, you know, how decades later they were going to engineer
[1:39:59.040 --> 1:40:02.960]  a German strong man and then set him up and then let him tear the hell out of Europe
[1:40:02.960 --> 1:40:08.640]  and then come in and take over. Exactly. They put Hitler into power and they kept him in power.
[1:40:08.640 --> 1:40:12.960]  Now, another thing, the way they control society, probably one of the most effective
[1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:18.720]  ways is their control of intelligence agencies. Adolf starts with MI6. That's the mother of
[1:40:18.720 --> 1:40:24.640]  old Masonic. And they admittedly run all the high class brothels, where they then just
[1:40:24.640 --> 1:40:28.000]  shut people up and it comes out that they run the brothels, they ship the drugs,
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:32.720]  and they just say that's how it is. And, you know, look what happened to Elliott Spitzer. He got
[1:40:32.720 --> 1:40:39.120]  out of line and, you know, they had the info on them and they got rid of them. But, and so the
[1:40:39.120 --> 1:40:45.360]  reason I mentioned the intelligence agencies, you know, the Masons, I see Freemasonry as just
[1:40:45.360 --> 1:40:51.440]  sort of a branch of the Cabela. Basically, Judaism for Gentiles, but the Freemasons don't
[1:40:51.440 --> 1:40:56.880]  realize this. I don't think the Jews even realize what they're involved in, what has happened to
[1:40:56.880 --> 1:41:01.520]  Judaism. You know, I don't think it's any longer a Misson monotheistic religion. Well,
[1:41:01.520 --> 1:41:06.480]  there's no secret that I'm not even sure if it's a religion anymore. Yeah, but there's no secret that
[1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:13.920]  Cabela and the Cabela all goes back to Egypt and then Babylon. And so all your major
[1:41:14.560 --> 1:41:21.120]  occultic religions go back. I think it's an overstatement to say that Jewish mysticism
[1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:27.280]  runs the gammon and is the dominant force because it itself is just a brand of Babylonian
[1:41:27.280 --> 1:41:32.960]  messier religion slash Egyptian. Okay. I mean, like, like you said, I'm not going to play,
[1:41:32.960 --> 1:41:37.200]  uh, like you, I don't want to play the game of where the responsibility lies. It's certainly
[1:41:37.200 --> 1:41:42.640]  spread widely. That's always been my point. And I'm glad to hear that it's your, your point too.
[1:41:42.640 --> 1:41:48.000]  Anyway, the reason I mentioned the intelligence agencies is, uh, CIA was started up by the,
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:54.240]  you know, MI sticks through OSF and essentially the central bankers run the CIA. Sure, there's
[1:41:54.240 --> 1:41:58.800]  a lot of little, you know, cells of the CIA that aren't aware of this. Oh no. I mean, I mean, we're
[1:41:58.800 --> 1:42:04.160]  sculling bones, people that commanded the entire CIA and still does. And that's all out of one
[1:42:04.160 --> 1:42:10.320]  university. Yeah. And Gloria Steinem, I mentioned Betty Friedan. Gloria Steinem was a CIA agent.
[1:42:11.280 --> 1:42:17.040]  Um, she wrote that one of her books. Yeah. She worked for the CIA and, uh, you know,
[1:42:17.040 --> 1:42:21.520]  whether she was on, you know, officially working for them or not, she was essentially doing their
[1:42:21.520 --> 1:42:27.520]  role when she, you know, poses a playboy bunny. And, you know, essentially they, they run the
[1:42:27.520 --> 1:42:33.680]  magazines, CIA, they run Esquire that ran Gloria Steinem story that made her famous. They ran
[1:42:33.680 --> 1:42:40.000]  New York magazine, which, uh, later hired Gloria Steinem anyway. She became, uh, with Betty Friedan,
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:46.400]  the other great leader of, uh, second wave feminism. And again, like Friedan who worked
[1:42:46.400 --> 1:42:51.760]  for the communist party, which is central banker controlled, uh, Steinem worked for the CIA,
[1:42:51.760 --> 1:42:57.040]  which is central banker controlled the whole and the whole feminist movement was, uh,
[1:42:57.920 --> 1:43:04.640]  led by the central banker agent for a central banker dupe. It was financed and promoted by them.
[1:43:04.640 --> 1:43:09.600]  And, uh, what I say often in my, in my articles in my book is that if you Google
[1:43:09.600 --> 1:43:14.720]  Rockefeller foundation and women's studies, you'll get something like 90,000.
[1:43:14.720 --> 1:43:19.920]  Oh yeah. It's incredible. I mean, they funded thousands of different organizations and groups,
[1:43:19.920 --> 1:43:25.200]  thousands of eugenics groups, hundreds of major, uh, foundations. I mean, they, it, it is just
[1:43:25.200 --> 1:43:31.920]  mind blowing. Exactly. We're in a laboratory. We're the subject. We can't trust anything
[1:43:31.920 --> 1:43:36.960]  we're taught in school, uh, anything we hear on the radio, anything we read in a book or
[1:43:36.960 --> 1:43:42.160]  in a magazine. We can't trust anybody, but I will say to your listeners, I like what I hear
[1:43:42.160 --> 1:43:47.120]  Alex Jones saying, I think we can trust Alex Jones. I think we can trust Jeff rents too.
[1:43:47.840 --> 1:43:52.800]  And, uh, and there's a few other people like Michael Rivera. Oh, thank God we have a few
[1:43:52.800 --> 1:43:57.600]  courageous men standing up who I think, um, do represent the truth.
[1:43:58.640 --> 1:44:03.120]  Well, you have to judge somebody by their long-term track record and the fruits that they bear.
[1:44:03.120 --> 1:44:08.640]  And you really shouldn't even trust us folks. You should go out and make your own decisions
[1:44:08.640 --> 1:44:13.680]  and you know you're good. So you need to get involved. And of course an agent will never
[1:44:13.680 --> 1:44:17.760]  tell you that an agent will never tell you to take action, get involved, do good things,
[1:44:17.760 --> 1:44:23.840]  fight the new world order, fight for sovereignty. If you notice I am diametrically opposed to every
[1:44:23.840 --> 1:44:28.640]  new world order program and I work on shattering the left, right paradigm. The establishment
[1:44:28.640 --> 1:44:35.600]  always tries to put you back into a left, right debate. You know, you used to have on your website
[1:44:35.600 --> 1:44:42.080]  on prison planet, a quote from Alexander Stolgenitsa, uh, where he says if, uh, when they started
[1:44:42.080 --> 1:44:49.520]  rounding us up, if, um, if they realized that they could be, uh, shot, uh, they might have
[1:44:49.520 --> 1:44:54.560]  put a whole different color on it. Remember that quote? Yeah. He said, oh, how we burned in the camps,
[1:44:55.280 --> 1:44:58.560]  wishing that when they came to pick us up one and one at night, we would have met them in the
[1:44:58.560 --> 1:45:03.600]  stairwells, you know, in the four years in the apartments with daggers and pokers and hatchets,
[1:45:03.600 --> 1:45:08.080]  basically as a paraphrase. And then they would have stopped them, which is what the drug cartels
[1:45:08.080 --> 1:45:14.640]  know, CIA run. They're telling Mexican police, join us or die, associated press. So this is
[1:45:14.640 --> 1:45:19.760]  all just survival of the fittest. Uh, but, um, go ahead, Henry. Well, I think you're just making
[1:45:19.760 --> 1:45:24.640]  the point that, uh, I mean, things have gotten to the point where in the United States it is,
[1:45:24.640 --> 1:45:30.240]  it is legal. You, you still have constitutional right to defend yourselves. And, uh, you know,
[1:45:30.240 --> 1:45:36.800]  you know, I think Americans need to, uh, defend, be prepared to defend themselves. Um, but, you
[1:45:36.800 --> 1:45:40.800]  know, but if they don't have weapons, they ought to, if they don't know how to use them, they ought
[1:45:40.800 --> 1:45:50.960]  to know how to use them. Henry, where do you see all this going? Well, you know, there is, there
[1:45:50.960 --> 1:46:00.240]  is a sense of urgency, but, um, I tend not to, I tend not to panic. I tend to detect a long-term
[1:46:00.240 --> 1:46:06.400]  agenda on their part. Things are, if you look in terms of five, 10 years, things are moving rapidly
[1:46:06.400 --> 1:46:13.120]  in their favor culturally. I think their agenda is more to enslave us than to, uh, absolutely, uh,
[1:46:13.920 --> 1:46:19.200]  kill us. And, uh, they're doing a good job of enslaving us. You can see the changes if you
[1:46:19.200 --> 1:46:25.920]  look at it decade at a time. So I sort of see more of the same going. Now, whether they'll actually,
[1:46:25.920 --> 1:46:33.280]  uh, pull off a third world war on us, um, I, you know, that's in the, that seems to be in the program,
[1:46:34.400 --> 1:46:39.760]  but, um, it doesn't make a lot of sense, uh, for a number of reasons. They own all the property
[1:46:39.760 --> 1:46:44.000]  anyway. Why would they want to destroy it? If they kill all the people, then that just destroys
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:48.960]  supply and demand. All their gold, if no one wants it, is not going to be worth anything.
[1:46:48.960 --> 1:46:54.000]  And on top of it, if you look at us slaves, I mean, we're debt slaves. I mean, they kill us,
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:47:00.160]  they'll never collect on the debt. So I tend to see us muddling, muddling on. I, I see things
[1:47:00.160 --> 1:47:09.600]  getting worse, but I don't see a catastrophe. I don't see an imminent catastrophe. Uh, that's
[1:47:09.600 --> 1:47:15.680]  just my sense of things. There's a New York Times story today where they kind of celebrate
[1:47:15.680 --> 1:47:21.120]  that it's up by 40 plus percent, the number of tattletale phone calls and the people call
[1:47:21.120 --> 1:47:28.480]  it begging saying, my grandson smokes marijuana, come arresting him. I need 500 bucks to train a
[1:47:28.480 --> 1:47:35.520]  grandmother to turn her grandson in or a woman to turn her husband in for money. The, you know,
[1:47:35.520 --> 1:47:40.320]  the grubbing, the falling over themselves for this green stuff that the globalists just print
[1:47:40.320 --> 1:47:48.320]  out of nothing out of it. You know, you essentially got the devil operating the money system and
[1:47:48.320 --> 1:47:53.600]  teaching us the value, teaching us to value money and nothing else. I mean, we live in a world that
[1:47:53.600 --> 1:48:00.400]  is controlled by the devil, not just metaphorically, but the devil literally has his hands on the
[1:48:00.400 --> 1:48:06.880]  lever. We are talking about devil worshipers who control society and our politicians are
[1:48:06.880 --> 1:48:12.720]  Obama's and our McCain's. These are just people who have satisfied the devil that he will do
[1:48:12.720 --> 1:48:17.040]  the devil worshipers. Yeah, they don't just, uh, they're not just willing to do evil. They're
[1:48:17.040 --> 1:48:21.920]  not just psychopaths. They're sadistic psychopaths. Now I've documented for myself that they are
[1:48:21.920 --> 1:48:26.160]  devil worshipers slash Luciferians, but how did you come to that conclusion?
[1:48:28.240 --> 1:48:34.880]  Well, I, I just tend to look at the fact that they're trying to come between a mother and a
[1:48:34.880 --> 1:48:39.840]  baby. They're trying to be a mother and her children. They're trying to, uh, trying to come
[1:48:39.840 --> 1:48:45.920]  between men and women and men who have nothing but protective and loving feelings for women. I mean,
[1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:52.480]  that's one indication. Another, you know, the line in the protocols that was designed to convince me
[1:48:52.480 --> 1:48:59.520]  that the thing was a jet was authentic was where the speaker says already in our cities and towns,
[1:48:59.520 --> 1:49:06.320]  there is a cold and forlorn feeling among the public. Um, that's just not the kind of thing
[1:49:06.320 --> 1:49:12.400]  that a, uh, a hoaxer would think of to write. And the idea that he would take pleasure in the fact
[1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:17.760]  that the public is alienated and isolated, and we're talking about the late 19th century,
[1:49:17.760 --> 1:49:24.560]  and take shortle at the fact that there is a cold and forlorn feeling in society,
[1:49:24.560 --> 1:49:32.560]  indicates that these people hate humanity. They hate humanity. And just as God loves humanity
[1:49:32.560 --> 1:49:40.320]  and God is love and God takes pride in humanity and wants us to know him, um, the devil hates
[1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:45.440]  humanity and wants to enslave us if not destroy us. So it's just little anecdotal things that
[1:49:45.440 --> 1:49:50.960]  have convinced me. I don't spend a lot of time reading, uh, you know, Freemasonry and shit like
[1:49:50.960 --> 1:49:56.880]  that because I can recognize a cesspool without getting into it, uh, by the smell.
[1:50:01.040 --> 1:50:09.520]  Well, uh, doc, the website, save the males.ca. And, uh, again, your book walks through a lot of this.
[1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:18.880]  I, I appreciate you coming on the broadcast with us. And, uh, I know you've woken a lot of people
[1:50:18.880 --> 1:50:23.120]  up to what's happening with the new world order. We can debate all day what group captains it,
[1:50:23.120 --> 1:50:28.160]  but there's no doubt the direction they're going in is extremely, extremely destructive,
[1:50:28.160 --> 1:50:33.360]  very, very destructive. So thank you for coming on with us. Uh, we'll, uh, you bet.
[1:50:33.360 --> 1:50:37.680]  Hold on a moment. I'll talk to you during the break. Yep. Thank you, Henry. Uh, we'll be right
[1:50:37.680 --> 1:50:40.560]  back. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got another big guest about how they're taking over the water
[1:50:40.560 --> 1:50:51.120]  supplies in the country coming up. And we've got, we are changed. They've got beat up by the goons.
[1:50:51.120 --> 1:50:55.920]  Our beloved republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty
[1:50:55.920 --> 1:51:00.560]  worldwide, but in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope. The first time in modern history,
[1:51:00.560 --> 1:51:04.960]  the people are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate
[1:51:04.960 --> 1:51:09.360]  their fellow man's understanding of the new world order master plan. We have a short time frame to
[1:51:09.360 --> 1:51:14.800]  fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat. In the info war, prisonplanet.tv is a

[1:54:15.280 --> 1:54:22.080]  And the sun is gonna burn into a cinder
[1:54:24.720 --> 1:54:28.400]  Before we ever pass this way again
[1:54:33.280 --> 1:54:38.240]  And we're gonna ride, we're gonna ride
[1:54:38.240 --> 1:54:45.040]  Ride like a one-eyed jack of diamonds with the devil
[1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:47.520]  Pulls his hands, we're gonna ride
[1:54:47.520 --> 1:54:53.760]  Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, the devil close behind. He's definitely behind me. It's
[1:54:53.760 --> 1:55:03.600]  better than in front. He's born a loser. I wanted to hold Henry McCow over for one more segment.
[1:55:03.600 --> 1:55:09.520]  He really is a great writer and researcher. So that he's got a friend.
[1:55:12.080 --> 1:55:15.120]  You know, she'll tell us about the story because I'm going to get him on later this week.
[1:55:16.240 --> 1:55:23.440]  We're talking about Kevin Anett. People were sending me emails about Kevin Anett and I was
[1:55:23.440 --> 1:55:29.440]  kind of ignoring them, especially an email about how mass graves have been found near
[1:55:29.440 --> 1:55:36.800]  Indian residential schools. And then I finally watched Kevin Anett's video. It's an hour and a
[1:55:36.800 --> 1:55:42.800]  half called Unrepentant and I realized, oh my god, this man is on to something.
[1:55:44.560 --> 1:55:52.640]  Let me spell his name for your listeners. It's A-N-N-E-T-T. That's Kevin Anett, A-N-N-E-T-T.
[1:55:52.640 --> 1:56:00.000]  He was a United Church minister on Vancouver Island, a small logging community,
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:07.840]  and in the true Christian spirit, he opened up his services to a lot of natives. He presided
[1:56:07.840 --> 1:56:13.840]  a lot of native funerals. He started asking questions about why people were dying and he
[1:56:13.840 --> 1:56:19.920]  started hearing stories about what went on in the Indian residential schools and he started
[1:56:19.920 --> 1:56:27.360]  digging out information that indicated that half the students of these schools were dying,
[1:56:27.360 --> 1:56:33.040]  they're being exposed to viruses, they're being sterilized, they were being beaten,
[1:56:33.040 --> 1:56:43.520]  and they're being sexually abused. And this is like a hidden Holocaust right here in Canada.
[1:56:43.520 --> 1:56:48.960]  Most Canadians aren't aware of it. And essentially, he was kicked out of the United
[1:56:48.960 --> 1:56:56.720]  Church of Canada, which is the old Methodist Presbyterian Church that united, and he was kicked
[1:56:56.720 --> 1:57:03.040]  out, unceremoniously kicked out. And it wasn't so much for asking these questions and getting
[1:57:03.040 --> 1:57:11.360]  this information. He publicly opposed a landfail where the church sold land which they held in
[1:57:11.360 --> 1:57:16.240]  trust were the natives to a large logging company. Well, let me just say this in closing. We're
[1:57:16.240 --> 1:57:22.560]  going to get him on later this week. His story meshes with what's admitted. I mean, that's what
[1:57:22.560 --> 1:57:26.560]  they've always done to the natives and it goes on right here in the US. We've had some of the
[1:57:26.560 --> 1:57:31.920]  tribal leaders on and now they just do it to everybody. And again, the nurse giving you a
[1:57:31.920 --> 1:57:36.720]  shot folks doesn't know she's part of this, but God help us and this goes to the cops too. They're
[1:57:36.720 --> 1:57:40.800]  attacking you too. And I know you want to roll your eyes and giggle and laugh and say it didn't
[1:57:40.800 --> 1:57:46.960]  happen. It is. It's admitted. It's in my film in game and heaven help us. These people running
[1:57:46.960 --> 1:57:51.600]  things are just unbelievable. And so he was just there witnessing them all being exterminated, huh?
[1:57:53.520 --> 1:57:58.160]  Well, he basically got the stories and because these schools were shut down, but they were never
[1:57:58.160 --> 1:58:03.200]  schools. They were more like concentration camps. The kids actually worked most of the time and
[1:58:03.200 --> 1:58:06.720]  were abused. There's very little school. Oh, no, I understand. Yeah, they're usually slave. And
[1:58:06.720 --> 1:58:11.040]  then they're there to be raped, there to be jackbooted and there to be killed and tested on
[1:58:11.040 --> 1:58:15.920]  by bio weapons programs. We'll find out more about this particular case coming up this week.
[1:58:15.920 --> 1:58:21.760]  Doc, thanks for coming on. Henry Macau, PhD. Save the mills.ca. Appreciate you coming on.
[1:58:23.760 --> 1:58:27.040]  All right, we'll be right back in one minute. Cover some more news. Then we got another big

[1:58:41.440 --> 1:58:49.520]  It is a big idea. A new world order in the near future. Earth is dominated by a powerful
[1:58:49.520 --> 1:58:57.040]  world government. It's known as the builder bird. But their objective being world domination. For thousands
[1:58:57.040 --> 1:59:03.040]  of years, their dark order grew. Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great
[1:59:03.040 --> 1:59:12.560]  dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan
[1:59:12.560 --> 1:59:17.600]  for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire
[1:59:17.600 --> 1:59:21.920]  new world order agenda. Build America is making great progress for the world government. Most
[1:59:21.920 --> 1:59:25.360]  people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after
[1:59:25.360 --> 1:59:31.760]  power. That's their after easy order in game on DVD at prison planet dot com or info wars dot com

[1:59:39.120 --> 1:59:49.040]  been warned. Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[1:59:55.440 --> 2:00:04.480]  Government coverups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[2:00:04.480 --> 2:00:12.400]  And now live from Austin, Texas. Alex Jones.
[2:00:18.960 --> 2:00:27.520]  If I came in your back door broke my way in with a crowbar and you caught me in your wallet
[2:00:27.520 --> 2:00:35.520]  stealing $800. Would you be angry with me? Well, you would be rightfully in your rights.
[2:00:36.320 --> 2:00:43.600]  You'd be correct to gun me down to open fire with your pump shotgun until I was dead. And that would
[2:00:43.600 --> 2:00:48.720]  then stop home invasions would scare criminals and would protect your family back when we behaved
[2:00:48.720 --> 2:00:55.040]  like that. We had almost no crimes. People would kill you. But the government has been selling
[2:00:55.040 --> 2:01:01.600]  water districts, private water facilities, public water facilities, things we've paid for to predominantly
[2:01:01.600 --> 2:01:08.480]  foreign companies. And they come in and overnight double triple quadrupled. And we have examples
[2:01:08.480 --> 2:01:12.880]  of bills where the newspapers have reported on this where they'll be 240 something bucks to
[2:01:12.880 --> 2:01:19.760]  1270 something bucks. I mean, boom overnight. Your trash pickup gets cut from once a week.
[2:01:19.760 --> 2:01:23.760]  I mean, from twice a week to once a week and they double it. Then a year later, they double it again.
[2:01:23.760 --> 2:01:29.280]  That's a quadrupling. This is the new lawlessness. And we got a guest coming on scheduled
[2:01:29.280 --> 2:01:32.080]  in the next segment. Let's just go ahead and get them lined up now.
[2:01:35.040 --> 2:01:43.280]  Some of the other news that I have here. Now, I see these probably four or five times a day.
[2:01:43.280 --> 2:01:49.600]  Major University, major government studies. They're just letting you know now 30 years into cell
[2:01:49.600 --> 2:01:54.480]  phones that, oh, by the way, most of you're going to be dying from brain tumors now. You know,
[2:01:54.480 --> 2:02:00.640]  if our shots don't kill you, this is, you tell the poor cops and they told them 20 years ago,
[2:02:00.640 --> 2:02:04.640]  those radar guns were frying them and they don't, they don't listen. Fine, don't listen. Just enjoy
[2:02:04.640 --> 2:02:10.960]  yourselves. Warning, using a mobile phone while pregnant can seriously damage your baby.
[2:02:11.760 --> 2:02:17.440]  Study of 13,000 children exposed link between use of headsets and later behavioral problems
[2:02:17.440 --> 2:02:27.440]  from brain development. And they have studies, multiple studies, absolutely proving that brain
[2:02:27.440 --> 2:02:31.760]  development problems, heart problems, because they have electrochemical nerves in them that are
[2:02:31.760 --> 2:02:38.800]  very sensitive, ganglia in the heart, a control, that incredible muscle, that just being in the
[2:02:38.800 --> 2:02:45.040]  motorized incubators, that the babies are actually better in the systems that don't have all of the
[2:02:45.040 --> 2:02:50.320]  magnetic fields. You ever notice when you get an AM radio next to a dishwasher and it picks up,
[2:02:52.320 --> 2:02:56.400]  that's because a wave is being thrown off. And it gets all into radio technology,
[2:02:56.400 --> 2:03:01.600]  microwave technology. The point is that you stick a baby inside a box with hundreds of gyros and
[2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:08.640]  equipment and nozzles and things spinning and scanning, it fries them. Okay, now, now, the
[2:03:08.640 --> 2:03:14.080]  fields off that aren't as strong as a cell phone. And it just gets into all that and it's hurting the
[2:03:14.080 --> 2:03:19.520]  kids bad, it's hurting all of us. And, you know, I was looking at houses a few years ago, and it
[2:03:19.520 --> 2:03:24.800]  was a nice one, but it was like 100 yards from a cell tower. I didn't live there. Looked at another
[2:03:24.800 --> 2:03:30.320]  house, it had high powered lines about 50 yards away, I didn't move there. You know, you want the
[2:03:30.320 --> 2:03:34.720]  house, your wife wants it, you just saw, it's a conspiracy theory, I'm going to move into it.
[2:03:35.840 --> 2:03:41.200]  You need to stay away from RF, UHF, you need to stay away from microwave transmissions,
[2:03:41.200 --> 2:03:46.640]  you need to stay away from high powered lines, if you care about yourself. I mean, the studies are,
[2:03:47.680 --> 2:03:52.160]  they knew back in the 40s with the radar dishes, where the troops would heat up their food,
[2:03:52.160 --> 2:03:55.920]  you know, on the back of the dish, and they found out it was frying them, they get sunburns from it.
[2:03:55.920 --> 2:04:02.000]  I know radio engineers, you go in there and AM transmitter for just 10 minutes, you get a sunburn.
[2:04:02.880 --> 2:04:07.840]  Okay, I'm going to explain to you, ladies and gentlemen, it's very bad for you. I know you
[2:04:07.840 --> 2:04:14.320]  can't see the waves, but they are there. They're just not visible to our light spectrum. They're
[2:04:14.320 --> 2:04:20.880]  in a different spectrum, different wavelength. And that's your daily warning, it's a big report
[2:04:20.880 --> 2:04:27.360]  on an independent, got links to it up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. God help us. I've
[2:04:27.360 --> 2:04:31.120]  basically completely quit using my cell phone. I don't think I've checked the messages in two weeks,
[2:04:31.120 --> 2:04:35.280]  I don't even know where it is. I know it's out of batteries actually, it's in my car.
[2:04:35.280 --> 2:04:38.880]  That's the new system. I'm just completely getting rid of it. I'm going to throw the thing away.
[2:04:39.760 --> 2:04:43.360]  Because if I have it, I'll just keep using it, but everybody's buying them for their kids,
[2:04:43.360 --> 2:05:06.960]  crying their little brains.
[2:05:14.960 --> 2:05:19.280]  you would like a book on the history of the Federal Reserve, we've got the most well researched

[2:05:45.360 --> 2:05:46.880]  Join the info war today.
[2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:54.880]  Hi neighbor. We all know that knowledge is power. We've tried to give you knowledge to help you
[2:05:54.880 --> 2:06:00.080]  prepare for rough times. There's the worldwide famine and our country's dependence on often
[2:06:00.080 --> 2:06:05.600]  dangerous food imports. You know about genetically poisoned food. Two-thirds of the food is
[2:06:05.600 --> 2:06:10.320]  disappearing with the bees along with huge crop failures from all-time record water shortages.
[2:06:10.880 --> 2:06:17.680]  You know they're turning food into fuel with corn ethanol plants. If we do not control our food,
[2:06:17.680 --> 2:06:22.640]  food will be used to control us. Food control has been the plan historically in every enslaved
[2:06:22.640 --> 2:06:28.560]  population and is the plan for America. The only value of the knowledge you have to take control
[2:06:28.560 --> 2:06:34.320]  of your food is if you choose to get a supply while you still have the freedom to choose.
[2:06:34.320 --> 2:06:43.360]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com. Call 800-409-5633.
[2:06:48.320 --> 2:06:52.880]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[2:06:52.880 --> 2:06:56.640]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients,
[2:06:56.640 --> 2:07:01.760]  most of which are synthetic. Hi folks, Alex Jones here. Why not go back to basics and be safe

[2:08:16.640 --> 2:08:22.400]  Alan Snidow is our guest and I really appreciate him coming on the show today.
[2:08:23.600 --> 2:08:30.240]  First, fighting the corporate theft of our water. There's a book, there's a film and I have read
[2:08:30.240 --> 2:08:36.560]  excerpts of the book online. I've seen clips online of the film. It really fits in to
[2:08:36.560 --> 2:08:43.360]  really what I have researched myself and the reason I'm saying that is this is an accurate book,
[2:08:43.360 --> 2:08:48.480]  an accurate film. In fact it probably doesn't even scratch the surface of how bad it really is,
[2:08:48.480 --> 2:08:55.840]  though it will completely shock you. It is just mind-blowing that we pay for the water systems.
[2:08:55.840 --> 2:09:01.600]  We sit on top of the aquifers that they're teaching us that water is a diminishing resource and
[2:09:01.600 --> 2:09:08.640]  you know they're preparing us to pay more. It's artificial scarcity and when the $240 bill goes
[2:09:08.640 --> 2:09:16.000]  up to $1,270, I mean this is the type of stuff that's going on and the raping is just intensifying.
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:20.240]  But look, we're Americans. We think we're free. We think it's the land of the free home of the brave
[2:09:21.040 --> 2:09:25.280]  and so we're taking advantage of. We pay on average five times what people in third world
[2:09:25.280 --> 2:09:30.400]  nations pay for prescription drugs. We pay about double what Europe does, about double what the
[2:09:30.400 --> 2:09:36.320]  Canadians pay, though in many cases they have higher standards of living than us. We don't
[2:09:36.320 --> 2:09:42.640]  have the highest standard now. We just dropped to like number three. We pay the most for everything,
[2:09:42.640 --> 2:09:48.960]  except for fuel and that's now changing as the dollar devalues and we are the most imprisoned
[2:09:48.960 --> 2:09:53.760]  population. We are the most obese population. We are the most unhealthy population next to the
[2:09:53.760 --> 2:10:00.880]  Russians and it is because multinational corporations know this is the happy hunting ground.
[2:10:00.880 --> 2:10:07.280]  30 million dumbed down, self-important people so busy worshiping themselves in the mirror
[2:10:07.280 --> 2:10:11.920]  that they have no idea that corporate crooks are running absolutely rampant. Now the corporate
[2:10:11.920 --> 2:10:15.440]  crooks know we're starting to wake up so they've written policy reports to militarize police,
[2:10:15.440 --> 2:10:19.920]  build more prisons, get ready to suppress free speech in case we don't like going into third
[2:10:19.920 --> 2:10:30.320]  world them as we're now sliding down into it. So we really appreciate our guest coming on with us
[2:10:30.320 --> 2:10:34.560]  today. And Alan, I've never talked to you before. Am I pronouncing your last name right?
[2:10:35.280 --> 2:10:39.280]  Sit down. Yes. Thanks a lot. Thanks for having me. You bet. Thanks for coming on. Tell us because
[2:10:39.280 --> 2:10:44.320]  you've been doing, you know, working on this for over a decade. When you first woke up to this scam,
[2:10:44.320 --> 2:10:49.440]  boil down the basics for us and then flush out what their current looting is.
[2:10:50.880 --> 2:10:57.920]  Well, I think I'd say that when we first really woke up to things was that where we lived,
[2:10:57.920 --> 2:11:07.280]  my partner Debra Kaufman and I in California, there was a company called Enron that sort of took
[2:11:07.280 --> 2:11:13.920]  over and they deregulated the energy prices and the way that energy was controlled. And the problem
[2:11:13.920 --> 2:11:20.400]  with that was that, of course, the company just took us for a ride. About $9 billion was cycled
[2:11:20.400 --> 2:11:26.320]  out of people's pockets here in California and sent to their headquarters in Texas and to the
[2:11:26.320 --> 2:11:32.000]  headquarters of other major energy companies which were controlling the market. And what we found
[2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:40.400]  out when that crisis sort of exploded and Enron became a scandal about how it controlled prices
[2:11:40.400 --> 2:11:45.440]  was that Enron had also had plans to become one of the biggest water companies in the world.
[2:11:46.160 --> 2:11:53.200]  They were buying up water resources in England, in Argentina, in California, and other parts of
[2:11:53.200 --> 2:12:00.320]  the country. And they were hoping to be able to do a bit with water, what they had done with energy.
[2:12:01.600 --> 2:12:08.560]  Luckily, they went bankrupt before they could get there. But the idea of being able to take advantage
[2:12:08.560 --> 2:12:16.960]  of the one resource which is absolutely essential for human life, which has been in this country
[2:12:16.960 --> 2:12:24.880]  a public service for all of the 20th and now into the 21st century. And by the way, in all of England,
[2:12:24.880 --> 2:12:30.640]  in all of England, and most areas, it's still free because you pay your taxes and it's so inexpensive
[2:12:30.640 --> 2:12:34.800]  through the water system to send people water. Now they're about to start charging them there and
[2:12:34.800 --> 2:12:41.840]  they're shocked. So again, this is about raping us for something that we've already paid for many,
[2:12:41.840 --> 2:12:49.120]  many times. Well, and there is what's happened also recently is that back when the Clean Water
[2:12:49.120 --> 2:12:58.320]  Act was passed in the 1970s and the EPA was created, there was a lot of money put in by
[2:12:58.320 --> 2:13:04.480]  the federal government into cleaning up water. That was the era when the river that runs through
[2:13:04.480 --> 2:13:09.520]  Pittsburgh caught on fire because there was so much chemical pollution from industry in the river.
[2:13:10.720 --> 2:13:17.440]  Rivers have been cleaned up, sewage treatment plants were modernized, industrial water treatment
[2:13:17.440 --> 2:13:24.240]  plants were created. And what happened since then, however, in the last 15, 20 years has been there's
[2:13:24.240 --> 2:13:29.280]  a dramatic cutback in investment in infrastructure across the country. We're seeing that with
[2:13:29.280 --> 2:13:34.800]  highway bridges collapsing, a huge water main in New York City today. And the feds are saying,
[2:13:34.800 --> 2:13:38.960]  we're not going to give you money, the states are going to give you money. You've just got a, wow,
[2:13:40.240 --> 2:13:47.280]  sounds like a fire engine. Yeah, you've got to trade in and hand in your water district that
[2:13:47.280 --> 2:13:53.840]  you pay for the people on to this guy. And this guy comes in the first year cheat, but then three
[2:13:53.840 --> 2:14:01.120]  years later, quadruple prices. Right. And that's been the offer that some private companies,
[2:14:01.120 --> 2:14:08.000]  these are multinationals based, two of them based in France, one based in Germany have been saying
[2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:13.920]  that, well, what we can do is we can do it better, faster, cheaper. You don't like government anyway,
[2:14:13.920 --> 2:14:19.200]  especially you folks in the United States. And so why don't you turn it over to the private sector?
[2:14:19.200 --> 2:14:26.480]  But let's be clear. They hire police forces, they gouge you, they just become the government.
[2:14:26.480 --> 2:14:33.360]  Go ahead. Well, I think that what we saw in, for example, in Stockton, California was not so much
[2:14:33.360 --> 2:14:39.040]  that they hired police forces, but what they did do was they sort of gotten involved in the political
[2:14:39.040 --> 2:14:45.840]  process because there was a initiative that citizens groups, grassroots people put on the ballot
[2:14:45.840 --> 2:14:52.000]  saying that you couldn't privatize our system without first putting it on the ballot. And
[2:14:52.640 --> 2:14:59.040]  you had these companies put in $70,000 in a small city's political initiative campaign
[2:14:59.040 --> 2:15:04.320]  in the space of a week or two. And that was really torquing, changing the quality of local
[2:15:04.320 --> 2:15:09.520]  politics when you've got a multinational company with enormous, unlimited resources, lawyers,
[2:15:09.520 --> 2:15:14.880]  campaign consultants and so forth, getting involved in local political races and local campaign.
[2:15:14.880 --> 2:15:18.960]  And that's a, that's a major problem that we're facing actually all over the country.
[2:15:18.960 --> 2:15:23.200]  And let me stop and throw this in. Well, yeah, we're the happy hunting ground. Not only are
[2:15:23.200 --> 2:15:30.960]  they doing that, but they even create subsidiaries that have a local name to be deceptive, correct?
[2:15:32.240 --> 2:15:36.000]  In many cases, yeah, they have lots of different, lots of different names
[2:15:37.120 --> 2:15:44.480]  that they, that they take so that the big energy company in Germany, which owned a big
[2:15:44.480 --> 2:15:50.560]  water company in England, took over a big water company in the United States called American
[2:15:50.560 --> 2:15:59.280]  Water. And their subsidiaries are Pennsylvania American, you know, Indiana American, California
[2:15:59.280 --> 2:16:06.320]  American. And so that's the way they're known, known here. That's a, a normal kind of thing.
[2:16:06.320 --> 2:16:10.800]  But many people find out about this, they almost find out about it too late. And they start to
[2:16:10.800 --> 2:16:14.640]  fight out against it. And so one of the things that we've, well, by the way, here they do have
[2:16:14.640 --> 2:16:21.120]  private police forces like the LCRA is constantly in trouble. And it's just a completely lawless
[2:16:21.120 --> 2:16:25.360]  organization. And, but they have attack forces that they'll release on anyone they wish.
[2:16:26.880 --> 2:16:34.880]  SWAT teams, everything. Rain of terror. That's a frightening, a frightening possibility.
[2:16:34.880 --> 2:16:42.720]  Um, in most places that we've seen that, uh, that remains somewhat contained on this water,
[2:16:42.720 --> 2:16:47.360]  on this waterfront, but it is getting scary because of climate change. There's now
[2:16:48.160 --> 2:16:53.840]  less water, uh, right where I live. There's now, uh, rationing that's going on, not rationing,
[2:16:53.840 --> 2:17:00.240]  but a cutbacks of 20%. Uh, if you, if you, uh, but see that as a scam, we know that
[2:17:00.240 --> 2:17:04.080]  secretary of the army white, before that was working for him, he would bring them in
[2:17:04.080 --> 2:17:08.160]  the legislature into fake computer screens that were real computer screens, but fake
[2:17:08.160 --> 2:17:12.720]  data showing them fake trading. Enron would just make up the number. And then that was just a mob
[2:17:12.720 --> 2:17:17.440]  front to put money into the Caimans. And they just imploded it and killed Lay and got him out of the
[2:17:17.440 --> 2:17:22.480]  way. And you know, you know, as the, or he had a heart attack, I'm sorry, uh, right after being
[2:17:22.480 --> 2:17:27.520]  convicted for, right before sentencing. And then really remember, they told you, oh, there's no
[2:17:27.520 --> 2:17:31.680]  energy. And it turned out there was plenty of energy. It was just part of raping the people.
[2:17:31.680 --> 2:17:35.600]  And I think it was more than nine billion, wasn't it? All, all, all, all told in California.
[2:17:35.600 --> 2:17:39.120]  Oh God, I don't know what the final, the final total of this thing was.
[2:17:39.120 --> 2:17:41.840]  It was like 26 billions. The last number I saw.
[2:17:41.840 --> 2:17:48.400]  Yeah. Yeah. Well, there, it's a, uh, in this case, in terms of the scarcity in, in, in water,
[2:17:48.400 --> 2:17:54.080]  there are real problems. Um, although, uh, there's plenty of water to go around. I mean,
[2:17:54.080 --> 2:17:57.120]  that's one of the ironies of this situation. That's what I was saying.
[2:17:57.120 --> 2:18:03.520]  Yeah. Water enormously. And the question is not paying, uh, paying a private company to take a
[2:18:03.520 --> 2:18:09.360]  profit off the top, off the top of that. Water is likely to get more expensive because we have
[2:18:09.360 --> 2:18:14.720]  to pay to clean it up and we're, we're polluting the water. So we have to stop polluting at the
[2:18:14.720 --> 2:18:19.600]  front end. If we, if we weren't dumping as much stuff into the water as we are, then we would
[2:18:19.600 --> 2:18:23.680]  have somewhat of a less of a problem, but we're still going to have some problems in parts of
[2:18:23.680 --> 2:18:28.160]  the country like here in California because the temperatures are going up and that means we have
[2:18:28.160 --> 2:18:33.680]  less NOPAC and that means we have less controllable water resources. And at times of the year, it'll
[2:18:33.680 --> 2:18:40.400]  be tougher. It has been getting hotter in California, but now they say it looks like
[2:18:40.400 --> 2:18:46.880]  temperatures are going to start dropping. Um, well, you mean this, uh, this spring?
[2:18:48.320 --> 2:18:52.080]  Well, just overall, NASA and others are saying the earth was heating. Now they think it's going
[2:18:52.080 --> 2:18:56.080]  to start cooling. Oh, okay. I hadn't heard that, but who knows what's really going to happen. You
[2:18:56.080 --> 2:19:00.880]  know, the weather is always changing. Well, I mean, you guys, though, your film and book has
[2:19:00.880 --> 2:19:05.200]  really woke a lot of people up. I'm told, I mean, I'll have people talk about it. So, uh,
[2:19:05.200 --> 2:19:08.880]  how are the multinationals trying to counter you? I want to talk about that when we get back,
[2:19:08.880 --> 2:19:16.400]  but go ahead and start. Um, the, uh, there's no major campaign against us. There's, they know us.
[2:19:16.400 --> 2:19:22.800]  They try to, uh, uh, respond to us when they, when they have to, they try to ignore us when they can.
[2:19:23.360 --> 2:19:28.960]  Um, but I think that there, the problem that they've already found is that there's been,
[2:19:28.960 --> 2:19:32.880]  when you've got, even though you're a multinational corporation, you have to beam down
[2:19:32.880 --> 2:19:38.000]  into the local area and a local community can oppose their activities. They have to convince
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:43.280]  people in the local area that they should bring in these companies. And that is the obstacle.
[2:19:43.280 --> 2:19:46.160]  And want to stay there, stay there, stay there. We'll be right back.
[2:20:39.680 --> 2:20:42.240]  We're in a no holds bar information war.
[2:20:42.240 --> 2:20:47.600]  Truth is our weapon and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to big brother.

[2:21:11.840 --> 2:21:15.840]  States government accountability office, the GAO has published the long term fiscal
[2:21:15.840 --> 2:21:20.320]  outlook document clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[2:21:20.320 --> 2:21:26.160]  This will directly affect programs like social security to FDIC's ability to ensure bank deposits.
[2:21:26.160 --> 2:21:31.360]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the US dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.

[2:24:26.880 --> 2:24:33.120]  Alan Snitchow is our guest. Author of first fighting the corporate theft of our water
[2:24:33.120 --> 2:24:44.160]  system. The film first as well. Website snitchow-coffman.org or just Google first, the film first,
[2:24:44.160 --> 2:24:50.960]  the book, you'll find it. Now, sir, I've actually studied this and you really are very even handed
[2:24:50.960 --> 2:24:55.280]  because for me, it's even far worse than even what you're articulating. So I want to get into the
[2:24:55.280 --> 2:24:59.680]  real horror stories. I mean, I know this, it's in waste management and everything. They more than
[2:24:59.680 --> 2:25:04.320]  doubled the price of my trash pickup, I don't know, five, six years ago and then cut it down to
[2:25:04.320 --> 2:25:10.080]  one pickup a week. When the local mob connected company that's known all over the world and
[2:25:10.080 --> 2:25:16.400]  60 minute specials for being Mafia run, Classic La Cosa Noster came in. We've had, you know,
[2:25:16.400 --> 2:25:19.920]  the water go up and up and up. I mean, everything just being, I mean, it's probably three times
[2:25:19.920 --> 2:25:23.840]  what it was 10 years ago and we're sitting on top of an aquifer, huge lakes everywhere.
[2:25:23.840 --> 2:25:30.720]  It's just squeezing us in and I see articles in the news. I heard a talk show covering thirst just
[2:25:30.720 --> 2:25:34.880]  last week, Dary Brownfield. He was reading news articles where it was talking about $200 bills,
[2:25:34.880 --> 2:25:39.120]  going to 1200 plus. I mean, can you get into that because that's, I mean, that's the proof of the
[2:25:39.120 --> 2:25:44.880]  pudding is they come in and then just suddenly everything goes up by insane leaps and bounds.
[2:25:44.880 --> 2:25:48.480]  Obviously, we don't want this. I mean, where are these companies getting the money to come in and
[2:25:48.480 --> 2:25:53.840]  buy everything up? Why are our governments selling it? Can they sell it? It's our water facility.
[2:25:55.200 --> 2:25:59.600]  Well, what's been, what we're trying to alert people to in thirst, the book and the movie,
[2:26:00.160 --> 2:26:06.000]  was that in recent years and particularly most intensely under the Bush administration,
[2:26:06.720 --> 2:26:14.400]  you've had government cut back the amount of money from our taxes that invests in services that
[2:26:14.400 --> 2:26:20.160]  are for us. In effect, they are starving the beast. This is actually a term that they used,
[2:26:20.160 --> 2:26:25.040]  starve the beast of government. And what they're actually doing is cutting the services that our
[2:26:25.040 --> 2:26:31.280]  taxes pay for in order to subsidize corporations, in order to push local governments and state
[2:26:31.280 --> 2:26:38.880]  governments into having to go to private companies and order to carry out the services that used
[2:26:38.880 --> 2:26:43.520]  to be in the public trust and the public responsibility. And that's a big problem for
[2:26:43.520 --> 2:26:48.320]  us because those companies come in, especially with something like water. Water is a monopoly.
[2:26:48.320 --> 2:26:52.720]  You only have one set of pipes underneath your ground going into your house. And so,
[2:26:52.720 --> 2:26:57.200]  in that situation, you have no choice. You have to get the water from that one source.
[2:26:57.200 --> 2:27:03.600]  And what we've got to, what we're pointing out is that there's no reason to have a private company
[2:27:03.600 --> 2:27:08.720]  come in and do this. What we've got to demand, and in fact, they've found that more than 90%
[2:27:08.720 --> 2:27:17.120]  of Americans are in favor of more public funding, more federal funding and support of pure water
[2:27:17.120 --> 2:27:22.000]  resources. Because it's not just that there's enough water to go around. You have to be able
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:26.720]  to produce that water. You have to be able to clean it. You have to be able in order to drink it.
[2:27:26.720 --> 2:27:28.800]  But here's the problem. You have to clean it at the other end.
[2:27:28.800 --> 2:27:32.720]  But here's the problem. The feds instead are mandating that you let the private
[2:27:32.720 --> 2:27:40.000]  privateers, the letter of Mark, the piratical individuals, take it over. So you can't go to
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:45.920]  Satan to cast out the devil. And as they say, you can't go to Beelzebub to get rid of Bathomet.
[2:27:46.560 --> 2:27:51.040]  Because we're looking at a system here where the feds are bought off by these very same institutions.
[2:27:51.600 --> 2:27:56.880]  I mean, this is the most fundamental thing is clean good water. Instead of having CPS out
[2:27:56.880 --> 2:28:00.640]  kidnapping half the kids in the city, we should spend that money on having good water.
[2:28:00.640 --> 2:28:05.840]  And I've also just seen the ratios of corruption, the profits these companies are making.
[2:28:05.840 --> 2:28:09.360]  I mean, it's just a no-brainer. We don't want private companies owning our water,
[2:28:09.360 --> 2:28:14.080]  especially foreign ones. But then you've got a choice. You've got to have government be involved
[2:28:14.080 --> 2:28:22.480]  in it. I can't go out and go to the local stream and produce clean water. So we have to,
[2:28:22.480 --> 2:28:28.400]  as a society, be able to have our water, our government, to guarantee this. This is one of
[2:28:28.400 --> 2:28:32.000]  the biggest problems. I understand, but you know what the feds are doing right now. They're doing
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:36.720]  the opposite of what you're saying. Well, I agree. And that is one of the reasons why the government
[2:28:36.720 --> 2:28:42.400]  has got to change. So that's, I mean, that's one of the key elements of what has been going on here.
[2:28:42.400 --> 2:28:47.840]  We've had the services that go to us. The things that are supposed, the government is supposed
[2:28:47.840 --> 2:28:53.120]  to serve the people. It's supposed to be by and for the people. But what's happened is that it's
[2:28:53.120 --> 2:28:59.520]  become for the corporations. So it has to be taken back. And in taking it back, we can start
[2:28:59.520 --> 2:29:04.880]  to move things. We can start to change the way that multinational corporations are controlling
[2:29:04.880 --> 2:29:10.560]  the regulatory system, are raising prices, are taking over our local services. Why don't we
[2:29:10.560 --> 2:29:15.360]  take those services back? And we need to do that through our votes and through our government.
[2:29:18.160 --> 2:29:22.560]  All right. Well, bottom line, we're being ripped off. We can argue about solutions all day.
[2:29:22.560 --> 2:29:26.640]  I don't see it getting any better. They're taking over the ports, waterways, roads,
[2:29:26.640 --> 2:29:32.240]  infrastructures, just grabbing and militarizing it. Private quasi-governmental hordes of armed
[2:29:32.880 --> 2:29:36.000]  troops running around, foaming at the mouth. Stay with us.
[2:29:38.320 --> 2:29:45.040]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:45.040 --> 2:29:53.840]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future,
[2:29:54.640 --> 2:30:00.000]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government. It's known as the Bilderberg group.
[2:30:00.560 --> 2:30:05.920]  But their objective being world domination. For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:30:06.560 --> 2:30:12.560]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[2:30:12.560 --> 2:30:20.800]  of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government
[2:30:20.800 --> 2:30:26.160]  is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:30:26.160 --> 2:30:29.920]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government. Most people have no idea.
[2:30:29.920 --> 2:30:33.280]  They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their

[2:31:50.240 --> 2:31:54.880]  being planned to join church and state. This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics and
[2:31:54.880 --> 2:31:59.840]  Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting block. Their agenda is enforcement
[2:31:59.840 --> 2:32:04.160]  of religious worship and morality by legislation. Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to
[2:32:04.160 --> 2:32:08.480]  guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty of conscience. History and the Bible prove to
[2:32:08.480 --> 2:32:12.880]  them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate. It must be our love of
[2:32:12.880 --> 2:32:17.840]  God and of country that prompts or constrains us. This will change the character, not civil
[2:32:17.840 --> 2:32:22.160]  enforcement. From history we saw that when church and state united, known as papal Rome,
[2:32:22.160 --> 2:32:26.720]  religious intolerance resulted. This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of
[2:32:26.720 --> 2:32:32.240]  our nation. America and papal Rome are uniting in this agenda. Protestant America, awake before it
[2:32:32.240 --> 2:32:37.920]  is too late, the prophecies are fast fulfilling. Jesus is coming soon for free materials call
[2:32:37.920 --> 2:33:04.080]  888-211-1715 or write the Bible says Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee 37771. I go back to it a lot
[2:33:04.080 --> 2:33:15.760]  because they run our planet. It's a window, end of what governs our lives. And I spent the time
[2:33:15.760 --> 2:33:34.080]  to read hundreds of pages of the IMF and World Bank documents that were released in March of 2002,
[2:33:38.160 --> 2:33:43.040]  where they talked about how they were going to take down third world countries. Now they would
[2:33:43.040 --> 2:33:50.240]  come in and seize the water when the nations didn't pay off their debts by design. They'd tell the
[2:33:50.240 --> 2:33:56.880]  politicians not to. Then they'd take over the water supply and triple the price overnight,
[2:33:56.880 --> 2:34:00.800]  cause riots, then the economy would implode, then consolidate that. And they talked about
[2:34:00.800 --> 2:34:04.240]  how they were coming in predatorily and buying up everything in the US to control us.
[2:34:05.920 --> 2:34:12.480]  And now here we are and we're talking to the writer, one of the writers, several writers with it,
[2:34:12.480 --> 2:34:17.760]  Michael LaFox, Deborah Coffman, and of course, Allen, who we're talking to right now,
[2:34:18.640 --> 2:34:24.480]  Allen Sininto, made a film and wrote the book Thirst, Film Thirst, Book Thirst, and you can
[2:34:24.480 --> 2:34:35.600]  go to the website, Sinidow-Coffman.org. We got a link on infowars.com. Sinidow spelled S-N-I-T-O-W-Coffman.org.
[2:34:35.600 --> 2:34:41.600]  Look, just run the gamut. Any other key points we should know, what their current scams are,
[2:34:43.200 --> 2:34:47.120]  where they're moving in, what they're doing, break that down for us.
[2:34:48.000 --> 2:35:00.000]  Okay, well one of the scams is that a lot of talk now is happening about bottled water companies
[2:35:00.000 --> 2:35:06.880]  coming in and bottling either local municipal water supplies or coming in and actually pumping
[2:35:06.880 --> 2:35:12.080]  from springs in particular areas. It's happening all over the country. Nestle is the big one,
[2:35:12.080 --> 2:35:23.600]  although they have local names like Deer Park and Zephyr Hills and so on. And what's occurring here
[2:35:23.600 --> 2:35:28.640]  is that if people get to thinking that the only way they can get their drinking water is through
[2:35:28.640 --> 2:35:34.160]  bottled water, which costs a thousand times more than tap water, then will we make the
[2:35:34.160 --> 2:35:39.920]  investments as a society that's necessary to keep our tap water clean? Because that's the
[2:35:39.920 --> 2:35:48.400]  big challenge. And bottled water is like an ideological offensive against the idea that
[2:35:48.400 --> 2:35:53.760]  we all deserve and have a right to clean water and that it's our government's responsibility
[2:35:53.760 --> 2:35:59.920]  to make sure that that happens. And so bottled water has been this trend. It's been a fad.
[2:35:59.920 --> 2:36:11.360]  It's grown very, very fast. People now are seeing that they're using 40 billion plastic bottles a
[2:36:11.360 --> 2:36:21.280]  day for bottled water. It's an absurdity. They're using enormous amounts of plastic that goes all
[2:36:21.280 --> 2:36:27.600]  into landfills. It's not recycled. It's just junk. And it takes an enormous amount of oil
[2:36:27.600 --> 2:36:32.480]  just to make the plastic bottles. And then the water is not more regulated. In fact,
[2:36:32.480 --> 2:36:38.320]  it's less regulated than what comes out of the tap. So you've got a real problem. And this is
[2:36:38.320 --> 2:36:43.360]  like an effort to say, drink our water that you're going to pay a thousand times more for. It's
[2:36:43.360 --> 2:36:52.000]  really a trick. And it's a sad one. We need to be able to make sure that the water that we have,
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:57.600]  the water that we get from our taps, is clean water and that people get tested the water if
[2:36:57.600 --> 2:37:02.320]  they're using well water so that they can actually make sure that the water is clean,
[2:37:02.320 --> 2:37:05.520]  that they're drinking. Because it is really the most essential part of our body.
[2:37:08.320 --> 2:37:13.200]  Well, it is. I don't like what the feds are mandating and paying to have added to the water
[2:37:13.200 --> 2:37:18.640]  and how they force local districts to put fluoride in their water. Sodium fluoride when we know that
[2:37:18.640 --> 2:37:22.960]  it's very toxic to the brain. And now a lot of the scientists and doctors that had pushed it
[2:37:22.960 --> 2:37:27.600]  earlier now admit they're wrong. What's your stance on them adding things? I mean, couldn't we
[2:37:27.600 --> 2:37:31.760]  medicate ourselves if we want sodium fluoride and think it's good for us? Couldn't we just take
[2:37:31.760 --> 2:37:37.440]  that ourselves? Well, fluoride is a local decision. It's not a federal one. Yeah, but they withhold
[2:37:37.440 --> 2:37:45.600]  money. There are a lot of places that don't have fluoride in the water. I know about 65% of the
[2:37:45.600 --> 2:37:51.840]  United States has it. I know the numbers and I think you might be, I know you're a water expert,
[2:37:51.840 --> 2:38:00.080]  but basically it's kind of like if Texas wanted its highway funds, it needed to put thumb scanners
[2:38:00.080 --> 2:38:04.800]  in in 93 and they did it. So I'm not going to get an argument with you, but I know I have family
[2:38:04.800 --> 2:38:09.360]  that runs little water operations in towns and things that are still government and they're
[2:38:09.360 --> 2:38:13.360]  basically told you put this in or the state's not going to give you your federal funds
[2:38:13.360 --> 2:38:17.760]  that they got and they're basically ordered to. Now, I understand it's not like it's a law,
[2:38:17.760 --> 2:38:24.320]  but I'm saying, okay, look, they're pressured to put it in. Well, in the case that there are
[2:38:24.320 --> 2:38:32.480]  different ones, one is the case of chlorine and so forth that's put into water to kill germs.
[2:38:32.480 --> 2:38:35.600]  But that's what the towns tell them. They tell them this water is completely clean.
[2:38:35.600 --> 2:38:40.800]  It's out of an aquifer, the head of the water supply. We do not need chlorine in here that
[2:38:40.800 --> 2:38:47.200]  massive evidence of cancer in the bladder, in the kidneys, in the liver and they just say,
[2:38:47.200 --> 2:38:54.800]  do it, we're ordering you to. But look. Well, chlorine in tap water, water that goes through
[2:38:54.800 --> 2:38:59.600]  pipes, whether it comes from an aquifer or not, there are sometimes breaks in pipes and so on.
[2:38:59.600 --> 2:39:04.960]  That's the thing that ensures that the water that it gets to you has not been infiltrated with
[2:39:04.960 --> 2:39:13.600]  any bacteria. And chlorine is the single greatest public health move that was ever made in history
[2:39:13.600 --> 2:39:18.480]  because people used to get cholera and so forth from their water supply.
[2:39:18.480 --> 2:39:24.160]  No, I fully understand that sanitation and indoor plumbing is the key to civilization.
[2:39:24.160 --> 2:39:30.000]  I'm just saying, so Sonia fluoride and we can have a debate about that is really bad. And
[2:39:30.960 --> 2:39:35.280]  I know that the level of chlorine in the Austin supply is as high as it is in a swimming pool
[2:39:35.280 --> 2:39:40.320]  and a fish dies when it swims in there. So I'm just saying we're drinking that and I boy,
[2:39:40.320 --> 2:39:45.200]  I wish there were reasons to reduce it. And I don't think people should drink tap water.
[2:39:45.200 --> 2:39:48.960]  I agree that a lot of the bottle water is a scam and even dirtier than the water.
[2:39:48.960 --> 2:39:52.160]  And they've had studies or it's killed people before it's been infected with stuff.
[2:39:52.160 --> 2:39:58.400]  But my point is, is that I think we should all filter our water because of the most water supplies
[2:39:58.400 --> 2:40:02.800]  have a Prozac, Ritalin, female hormones. I'm sure you've heard about that.
[2:40:03.840 --> 2:40:11.280]  Yeah, I think that, you know, other than like filtering for the taste, I think that you can
[2:40:11.280 --> 2:40:19.360]  have pretty good sense of what your local water supply is providing you. The amount of the
[2:40:19.360 --> 2:40:25.920]  pharmaceuticals that have recently been a lot of publicity about is a kind of horizon problem
[2:40:25.920 --> 2:40:29.760]  that has to be dealt with. But you know what? The way it has to be dealt with is we're going
[2:40:29.760 --> 2:40:35.120]  to have to modernize our treatment plants so that sewage treatment plants take it out
[2:40:35.120 --> 2:40:40.080]  and that drinking water treatment plants take it out. And that's the way it's going to have to
[2:40:40.080 --> 2:40:46.320]  happen because tap water is extremely reliable. But we're not keeping up with the threat because
[2:40:46.320 --> 2:40:51.280]  industry and agriculture are putting more and more and new mixtures of chemicals,
[2:40:51.280 --> 2:40:56.160]  whether it's pharmaceuticals, whether it's atrazine, that's put on corn and corn has
[2:40:56.160 --> 2:41:00.480]  been expanding enormously. Oh yeah, the herbicides, the pesticides, that's the big one.
[2:41:01.040 --> 2:41:08.160]  That's a huge, these are huge challenges. And unless we modernize all these systems,
[2:41:08.160 --> 2:41:13.200]  and there are a lot of jobs involved in modernizing these systems, this is the kind of investment
[2:41:13.200 --> 2:41:17.520]  that we should be doing in this country in order to be able to keep things going.
[2:41:17.520 --> 2:41:21.760]  Actual jobs that aren't, that aren't prison guards or we can't have that.
[2:41:21.760 --> 2:41:26.080]  We could have hundreds of thousands of jobs. We actually, we've got pipes that are 100,
[2:41:26.080 --> 2:41:32.480]  150 years old that are still active in a lot of cities and a lot of towns across the country.
[2:41:32.480 --> 2:41:37.440]  We need to replace those pipes. And there's a lot of work to be involved in doing that.
[2:41:37.440 --> 2:41:41.040]  We need to modernize a lot of the plant equipment, a lot of the highways.
[2:41:41.040 --> 2:41:46.000]  There is an enormous amount in which we're letting this country's basic infrastructure
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:50.880]  fall apart. And that is an investment which actually produces the kind of jobs that are
[2:41:50.880 --> 2:41:55.280]  high paying jobs, that are decent jobs that people can have in this country at a time when
[2:41:55.280 --> 2:42:00.560]  unemployment is rising. And when we've got a problem with bridges falling in the Minneapolis,
[2:42:00.560 --> 2:42:06.560]  we've got all kinds of infrastructure problems. Why don't we address them? That's where our
[2:42:06.560 --> 2:42:11.520]  economy has to go. To address what's real, rather than providing a small group of people
[2:42:11.520 --> 2:42:16.240]  with a couple of multinational corporations that want to have a corner on the water market,
[2:42:16.240 --> 2:42:20.640]  those people are the ones who want to raise the prices and not deal with the infrastructure.
[2:42:20.640 --> 2:42:25.120]  Exactly. They're not even upgrading. They're just pirating and jacking up the price and
[2:42:25.120 --> 2:42:30.720]  sucking off a decaying system. They even admitted it in a German company
[2:42:30.720 --> 2:42:33.840]  that controls one of the biggest water companies in the United States.
[2:42:33.840 --> 2:42:38.640]  They had a board meeting saying, we'd better get out of the water business because there's
[2:42:38.640 --> 2:42:43.520]  so much opposition to our coming in, number one, on the local level. But number two,
[2:42:43.520 --> 2:42:48.400]  they also said, wow, there's so much money we have to put in, but it's not worth it for us
[2:42:48.400 --> 2:42:55.200]  because we can't make a quick killing on water as we had expected. And that is the truth.
[2:42:55.200 --> 2:43:00.080]  They have, their work cut out for them if they get into water because we can't deal
[2:43:00.080 --> 2:43:04.800]  without water and we're going to insist that they or anyone else who does water,
[2:43:04.800 --> 2:43:08.880]  including our own government, provide it and provide it at a decent price and make sure
[2:43:08.880 --> 2:43:12.640]  that it's clean. We have to insist on those things. We can't get along without it.
[2:43:14.640 --> 2:43:17.360]  Well, I agree with you. I'm glad.
[2:43:18.160 --> 2:43:22.560]  No, I agree with you that we've got a serious problem and a lot of scams that are going on.
[2:43:22.560 --> 2:43:27.760]  And we need to have a public debate about this and not just let the privateers come in
[2:43:27.760 --> 2:43:32.080]  because this is not privatization. This is not free market. It'd be free marketer. They came in
[2:43:32.080 --> 2:43:39.120]  and paid proper market price, agreed that they weren't going to gouge, offered a lot of things,
[2:43:39.120 --> 2:43:43.360]  which they don't. And it's just a bad idea. I mean, I'm for a free market system,
[2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:50.880]  but if we've already invested, already paid, it's been proven that especially local community
[2:43:50.880 --> 2:43:56.720]  things are not for government at the federal level in any size or shape or form like it is now.
[2:43:56.720 --> 2:44:02.240]  But locally, it really does work for water supply. And that's how the systems were built
[2:44:02.240 --> 2:44:07.360]  and maintained. So to try to duplicate that or add a whole other layer of now corporate bureaucracy,
[2:44:07.360 --> 2:44:12.000]  they're going to cheat us. They're going to rip us off. And they've certainly done that.
[2:44:12.000 --> 2:44:17.120]  What are some of the most egregious examples of price increases that you've seen that you document?
[2:44:17.760 --> 2:44:24.000]  Well, I agree with you on the free market system. But one of the things that I've always been
[2:44:24.000 --> 2:44:28.000]  heard about a free market system is that generally it's about competition.
[2:44:28.880 --> 2:44:32.720]  You've got to have a competition in the marketplace. And one of the things that
[2:44:32.720 --> 2:44:38.080]  happens when you're dealing with your water and the pipes is that there isn't any competition.
[2:44:38.080 --> 2:44:42.160]  So it's a whole different kind of situation. Once you give up control of your water supply,
[2:44:42.160 --> 2:44:49.760]  you have nowhere else to go. So that is one of the big problems. In terms of water price increases,
[2:44:49.760 --> 2:44:56.400]  there's a town not far from where I live, where over the last year or two, they came in with a
[2:44:57.520 --> 2:45:03.680]  this German company took over. And they've come in with demanding more than 100% increase
[2:45:04.560 --> 2:45:09.600]  over the last couple of years. And this has happened in other parts of the country as well.
[2:45:09.600 --> 2:45:14.800]  And some local governments have actually said, we want to take our water systems back because,
[2:45:14.800 --> 2:45:23.440]  first of all, providing water for people is not a money loser for local government.
[2:45:24.400 --> 2:45:29.200]  And it is a basic service that should be provided by local government. And these guys,
[2:45:29.200 --> 2:45:35.040]  the corporations, are one charging more. They're constantly demanding new investment. They say
[2:45:35.040 --> 2:45:39.360]  that they're going to put in private money, their own money. But in fact, they don't. They say,
[2:45:39.360 --> 2:45:44.160]  oh, well, now we're running the system. Why don't you put more money in because we need
[2:45:44.160 --> 2:45:48.160]  these changes? And finally, in Stockton, for example, and this has happened elsewhere,
[2:45:48.800 --> 2:45:55.840]  they ran the system to fail. It's called run to fail, rather than replace pipes and replace
[2:45:55.840 --> 2:46:03.920]  equipment proactively so that things would not fall apart. They actually delayed and waited
[2:46:03.920 --> 2:46:10.480]  until things would fall apart because then they could say, well, they've gotten every bit out of
[2:46:10.480 --> 2:46:17.200]  a piece of equipment, rather than just saying, well, we can't afford because this is a public
[2:46:17.200 --> 2:46:24.800]  service to have this fail. If you're a public service, that means that you are being active to
[2:46:24.800 --> 2:46:29.280]  make sure that that service is there and that it doesn't fail rather than running your equipment
[2:46:29.280 --> 2:46:42.640]  to fail. What's their big goal? What propaganda are the private water profiteers pushing right now?
[2:46:44.400 --> 2:46:49.840]  Their propaganda remains the same. They're saying that private company, because it's in the free
[2:46:49.840 --> 2:46:56.240]  market, supposedly, it can be more efficient. The government is inefficient. The government
[2:46:56.240 --> 2:47:03.840]  employees don't work well, that they should have a quote-unquote partnership with government to
[2:47:03.840 --> 2:47:11.200]  deliver water and that they will take over control and management of your local water supply, of your
[2:47:11.200 --> 2:47:17.360]  wastewater system. And these are the lines that they have constantly brought forward. More and
[2:47:17.360 --> 2:47:23.120]  more local governments are finding, and once they fell into these kind of ideas because they've got
[2:47:23.120 --> 2:47:30.400]  so much tight budgets now in local areas, we're having real crunches in local budgets and state
[2:47:30.400 --> 2:47:36.560]  budgets, the result of that is that you have mayors saying, we've got to be able to get services
[2:47:36.560 --> 2:47:44.880]  out of our budget. Why don't we sell it off to a private company? And that is the wrong way to go.
[2:47:45.600 --> 2:47:50.000]  Absolutely. Listen, I really appreciate you coming on and spending time with us, folks,
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:55.680]  can find out more. Which websites should they visit? Well, the easiest one to remember is
[2:47:56.240 --> 2:48:06.880]  thirstthemovie.org. Thirstthemovie.org. And that has both our book and our movie there,
[2:48:06.880 --> 2:48:12.960]  how you can get them. Okay. A lot more information. I appreciate all the time you've given us and
[2:48:12.960 --> 2:48:18.960]  keep up the good work. Thank you very much. Take care, folks. You may not be too into your water,
[2:48:18.960 --> 2:48:23.840]  but you just take it for granted that it comes out of the pipe at your house. But this is what
[2:48:23.840 --> 2:48:29.280]  affects us. And then this is the type of basic infrastructure we're being cheated on. But let
[2:48:29.280 --> 2:48:35.120]  me be clear. It's not just private corporations that double and triple prices. And I've seen
[2:48:35.120 --> 2:48:39.600]  examples of that in news where, like I said, the $240 something a bill and then a year later,
[2:48:39.600 --> 2:48:45.200]  it's 1200 and some of the same amount of water. The governments are doing this too.
[2:48:45.200 --> 2:48:52.160]  The governments are jacking up prices anywhere they have a monopoly. And government has a monopoly
[2:48:52.160 --> 2:48:57.040]  on force in your city. They have a monopoly on everything. But the super abuses we're seeing
[2:48:57.040 --> 2:49:02.480]  when government teams up with private corporations. And around here, I mean, you'll have, you know,
[2:49:02.480 --> 2:49:07.840]  the former mayor's wife on the board of the water company. And you'll have the guy on the
[2:49:07.840 --> 2:49:12.080]  Campo board handing over the roads to private companies to put toll roads on existing roads.
[2:49:12.080 --> 2:49:16.560]  And he has a daughter and son will work for the toll road company. I mean, getting hundreds of
[2:49:16.560 --> 2:49:22.960]  grand, I mean, it's just, it's just lawlessness, completely lawless. And the economy's going
[2:49:22.960 --> 2:49:28.960]  bankrupt. Look, a great example is Enron. They stole hundreds of billions nationwide and worldwide.
[2:49:28.960 --> 2:49:35.840]  They stole 20 plus billion when that collapsed out of California in one year, jacking up electricity
[2:49:35.840 --> 2:49:41.360]  prices. And they even had the, they would turn the power off and then later came out in documents
[2:49:41.360 --> 2:49:46.640]  to create the perceived image that the power really wasn't there. Then people would accept
[2:49:46.640 --> 2:49:51.920]  three times, four times, five times the price. That's in the IMF documents. They say, you turn
[2:49:51.920 --> 2:49:56.720]  the water, you turn the electricity off because then they'll accept anything. You know, they've
[2:49:56.720 --> 2:50:01.200]  got it like with the gas shortage. They've now declassified. They staged in the late 70s. They
[2:50:01.200 --> 2:50:07.520]  had plenty of oil, but before they could raise it and bring it from 45 cents a gallon to a dollar
[2:50:07.520 --> 2:50:14.240]  a gallon, double the price, they had to shut it down and then order their facilities not to ship
[2:50:14.240 --> 2:50:18.560]  the oil. There was plenty of oil. They had oil execs on. I had family that worked, you know,
[2:50:18.560 --> 2:50:24.480]  for oil companies there. They saw it. The barges that were full of oil, they create that perceived
[2:50:24.480 --> 2:50:32.960]  need, that perceived scarcity. And they're doing it now and it's all collapsing. I mean,
[2:50:32.960 --> 2:50:36.560]  they've hired all these millions of cops and now the economy's falling apart. They're just going
[2:50:36.560 --> 2:50:42.640]  to squeeze tighter to get their money. And it's going to get a lot worse for it. It's better.
[2:50:42.640 --> 2:50:46.880]  All right, a ton of news, more guests coming up, really hardcore info. So you'll want to stay with
[2:50:46.880 --> 2:50:52.400]  us, ladies and gentlemen, but I wanted to cover water. It is a big idea, a new world order.
[2:50:53.040 --> 2:50:58.960]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government. It's known as the
[2:50:58.960 --> 2:51:05.440]  Builderberg. Both their objective being world domination. For thousands of years, their dark
[2:51:05.440 --> 2:51:11.920]  order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[2:51:11.920 --> 2:51:20.960]  80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government
[2:51:20.960 --> 2:51:26.320]  is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:51:26.320 --> 2:51:30.080]  Builderberg is making great progress toward a world government. Most people have no idea.
[2:51:30.080 --> 2:51:33.440]  They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their

[2:52:17.760 --> 2:52:22.880]  irritable bowel syndrome and constipation. It helps with all of those elements. That's amazing.
[2:52:22.880 --> 2:52:28.640]  And the bentonite clay and medicline's eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal track.

[2:52:51.840 --> 2:52:56.560]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[2:52:56.560 --> 2:53:01.920]  I have run across a company called SFR who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[2:53:01.920 --> 2:53:06.800]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, protect a complete
[2:53:06.800 --> 2:53:12.800]  fuel system treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage and only one tank
[2:53:12.800 --> 2:53:18.000]  full. Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction, but it extends the life of your engine.
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:22.640]  Let's face it. With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action. Purchase a protective
[2:53:22.640 --> 2:53:29.040]  fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value
[2:53:29.040 --> 2:53:37.040]  free. Call triple-8 use SFR-1. That number again is triple-8 use SFR-1 or check them out online

[2:53:55.040 --> 2:54:02.160]  It's rolling around the bed and I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when I'm stuck
[2:54:02.160 --> 2:54:11.680]  in boats in prison. And time keeps dragging on. But that train keeps moving. But that train keeps
[2:54:11.680 --> 2:54:15.840]  rolling. All right, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, I just found out during the break,
[2:54:15.840 --> 2:54:24.320]  variety reporting. George Clooney has optioned the book, The Men Who Stare at Goats.
[2:54:26.160 --> 2:54:31.440]  So I got to get John Ronson on the show and I got to get General Stubblebine, the commander of
[2:54:31.440 --> 2:54:38.720]  the men that stared at goats. All the mind control, all the psychic warfare powers at Fort Bragg
[2:54:38.720 --> 2:54:47.520]  that they had in the 70s, 80s, 90s. And he wrote a book about that and it was the best seller
[2:54:47.520 --> 2:54:52.080]  and Clooney at Cairns is going to make that his next big movie with George Clooney, I guess,
[2:54:52.080 --> 2:54:55.200]  playing Stubblebine. We got to get Stubblebine on. He's been on a couple of times with us.
[2:54:55.840 --> 2:55:01.120]  What a character. The point is, this is what the government's into. And Stubblebine is very,
[2:55:01.120 --> 2:55:06.400]  very interesting to say the least. But that's just a weird tidbit I thought I'd tell you about.
[2:55:06.400 --> 2:55:12.080]  There's lots of news like that that is weird and kind of fits into what we cover here. But
[2:55:13.120 --> 2:55:18.560]  like some guy spent 20 years inventing something that's like out of G.I. Joe Kubra Commander,
[2:55:19.200 --> 2:55:23.280]  where they've got a Y-Wing kind of like,
[2:55:26.640 --> 2:55:32.240]  kind of like, you know, the people that jump off clips with those, you know, those hang gliders.
[2:55:32.240 --> 2:55:37.200]  But it's a hard fixed wing deal with four huge, well, they're not that big, but they're big
[2:55:37.200 --> 2:55:42.480]  compared to the person engines. And there he is just flying around like something out of a movie
[2:55:42.480 --> 2:55:48.880]  in the mountainous air above mountains, like something out of a science fiction movie. But
[2:55:48.880 --> 2:55:54.960]  it's 2008, ladies and gentlemen. I don't just mean a jet pack. I'd rather talk about stuff like that
[2:55:54.960 --> 2:56:03.760]  all day. By the way, we're going to go live at prisonplanet.tv here in just a couple of minutes.
[2:56:05.200 --> 2:56:09.840]  And we are going to be opening the phones up in the next hour and 30 minutes.
[2:56:09.840 --> 2:56:16.080]  We're going to have We Are Change Ohio and We Are Change Kentucky on. They went in,
[2:56:16.080 --> 2:56:20.160]  they had official press passes. They asked Oliver North about the concentration camp program.
[2:56:20.160 --> 2:56:25.440]  And they, when they were walking out, jumped on one guy from behind grabbing his camera,
[2:56:25.440 --> 2:56:30.480]  tackled him, and then said, we're going to charge you with felonies for withholding evidence,
[2:56:30.480 --> 2:56:35.920]  because you somehow having memory chips in their cameras was withholding evidence.
[2:56:35.920 --> 2:56:40.640]  So they stole the memory chips, stole the batteries, took them outside,
[2:56:40.640 --> 2:56:44.720]  screamed at them for 45 minutes like drill sergeants. I mean, this is the press being
[2:56:44.720 --> 2:56:51.360]  attacked, ladies and gentlemen. I got so mad about it yesterday on air when we had Adam
[2:56:52.240 --> 2:56:55.520]  on from We Are Change Kentucky. I want to get him on and the other guys. We've been able to get a
[2:56:55.520 --> 2:57:00.320]  hold of Adam. I have the numbers for the other guys. Guys, if you're out there calling to the
[2:57:00.320 --> 2:57:04.640]  network, because I'm trying, I want to get you guys on the last 30 minutes of the show. And we
[2:57:04.640 --> 2:57:09.120]  got Adam coming on, but I heard him last night after I'd interviewed Adam, I heard him on another
[2:57:09.120 --> 2:57:13.120]  show and I'll drive around the car. And it was unbelievable. It's even worse than what Adam was
[2:57:13.120 --> 2:57:17.440]  saying. And it was very credible how they were telling their story. And there's photos of them
[2:57:18.080 --> 2:57:25.360]  up on prisonplanet.com all tore up. A 9-11 blogger has it too, you know, cut from it.
[2:57:26.320 --> 2:57:30.800]  And what they did, I mean, it's just in Oliver North posing as a conservative.
[2:57:31.360 --> 2:57:35.920]  I mean, these people make me sick. They really make me sick. And
[2:57:35.920 --> 2:57:44.720]  we are changed assaulted by police in Louisville. Oliver North confronted video footage confiscated.
[2:57:44.720 --> 2:57:48.160]  Members of We Are Changed is from WeAreChanged.org actually has the story.
[2:57:48.800 --> 2:57:54.400]  We're physically removed from Louisville Exposition Center on Sunday after confronting Iran contra
[2:57:54.400 --> 2:57:58.880]  figure Oliver North. Members questioned North on his involvement with continental government
[2:57:58.880 --> 2:58:04.320]  in the new 9-11 investigation and the concealment camps in America. Lieutenant Oliver North,
[2:58:04.320 --> 2:58:08.480]  a Fox News host, was confronted by a combination of activists from We Are Changed, Ohio,
[2:58:09.040 --> 2:58:13.680]  Kentucky Change. Cody Deed stood up during the question and answer session and asked
[2:58:13.680 --> 2:58:19.040]  him about the continental government program. And that's when the secret police went crazy.
[2:58:19.040 --> 2:58:22.400]  So you don't ask questions in America, boy, that's not allowed. This is the land of the
[2:58:22.400 --> 2:58:26.400]  Calard home of the slaves. We'll see you at prisonplanet.tv on the other side. Stay with us.

[3:00:11.680 --> 3:00:17.520]  We're going to be talking to we are change Kentucky. We are change Ohio later in the shower.
[3:00:17.520 --> 3:00:23.200]  They were assaulted by private security guns and police at the NRA convention in Louisville,
[3:00:23.200 --> 3:00:28.960]  Kentucky. They peacefully went to the event. They had accredited press passes. They got
[3:00:28.960 --> 3:00:32.640]  when they asked Oliver North about continuity of government. I'm going to play some of that video
[3:00:32.640 --> 3:00:36.960]  later. Came out in the Congress. They're planning to put Americans in concentration camps,
[3:00:36.960 --> 3:00:41.200]  which is now mainstream news repackage brought out more news on that today.
[3:00:42.080 --> 3:00:45.680]  They told them leave and as they were leaving, they tackled one guy in the back
[3:00:45.680 --> 3:00:52.160]  and stole their camera equipment, stole their digital recording chips and then threatened
[3:00:52.160 --> 3:00:58.320]  to charge them all with felonies saying that something about having computer chips and cameras
[3:00:58.320 --> 3:01:02.640]  was was absconding with federal evidence. They were all going to prison for the rest of their
[3:01:02.640 --> 3:01:07.280]  lives and then they just screamed at them and laughed at them for 45 minutes. And that's what
[3:01:07.280 --> 3:01:13.280]  our country's turned into just a land of humiliation, a land of cowardice, a land of degeneracy.
[3:01:14.240 --> 3:01:20.880]  I have another big story here out of the New York Times today. And I want to spend more time on
[3:01:20.880 --> 3:01:29.360]  this and take your calls on this issue and on some other issues as well. And this just says
[3:01:29.360 --> 3:01:34.320]  that people turn in their children, grandchildren, parents for money, the most petty of crimes,
[3:01:34.320 --> 3:01:38.880]  marijuana, you name it. And they just call up wanting a hundred bucks, $500. They say,
[3:01:38.880 --> 3:01:44.000]  you know, my, my son's smoking pot, I need 500 bucks. And they go, all right, we're coming.
[3:01:44.960 --> 3:01:48.720]  And it says it's good. The article is about how good this is and how the people are finally
[3:01:48.720 --> 3:01:54.560]  being good Americans. And you can't make this up. You can't make up. We are the most slovenly
[3:01:54.560 --> 3:01:59.920]  degenerate, wicked people on earth. Now, a lot of us are good. I'm saying by and large, it's like
[3:01:59.920 --> 3:02:05.840]  you have a barrel of apples and, you know, 60% of the apples are filled with worms and there's
[3:02:05.840 --> 3:02:11.840]  a bunch of cow manure dumped on top of it. And then a bucket of ticks. You don't eat apples out of
[3:02:11.840 --> 3:02:17.760]  any of that. I mean, are there 40% good apples? Yes, but the worms are now eating into those.
[3:02:17.760 --> 3:02:23.840]  And soon there won't be any apples left. It'll just be a big mush of worms and ticks. And I mean,
[3:02:23.840 --> 3:02:29.040]  that's really what we are. And it's a country where cowards like Oliver North, that hate this
[3:02:29.040 --> 3:02:36.640]  country and helped ship in narcotics as the CIA's unsolicited general reported to Congress
[3:02:36.640 --> 3:02:41.600]  and who helped run death squads is hailed as a conservative as his conservative God, George Bush,
[3:02:41.600 --> 3:02:46.000]  opens the border, triples the size of the BATF, destroys the dollar, destroys our name. And
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:02:49.920]  of course, Oliver North is nothing but a complete coward and a puppet and a fake conservative. I
[3:02:49.920 --> 3:02:55.360]  mean, he's not even worth a mention other than the fact that he had his goons violate the First
[3:02:55.360 --> 3:02:59.280]  Amendment rights of U.S. citizens. And it's one thing to do that in Guatemala, Nicaragua,
[3:02:59.280 --> 3:03:04.640]  Al Salvador, Colombia. It's another thing to do that in the U.S. And now they have Mexican cartels
[3:03:04.640 --> 3:03:10.560]  run by the CIA, murdering police in the U.S., murdering the other drug cartels that haven't
[3:03:10.560 --> 3:03:14.640]  paid their cuts. As the people that run our government, the criminal crime center can consolidate
[3:03:14.640 --> 3:03:21.040]  its power. Our government's running these hits and running these operations. And I'm just tired
[3:03:21.040 --> 3:03:25.360]  of it. I'm tired. I mean, look, it's simple. The big banks that own our country,
[3:03:28.240 --> 3:03:32.320]  they decided, why don't we just take over the U.S.? Why don't we just run it? Why don't we
[3:03:32.320 --> 3:03:36.080]  triple charge people for their water and triple charge for their trash pickup? And why don't we
[3:03:36.080 --> 3:03:40.240]  arrest people and give them 10 years in prison for speeding now or arrest you for not having a seat
[3:03:40.240 --> 3:03:45.200]  belt or arrest you for not having a turn signal on? Or why don't we train your children to tattle
[3:03:45.200 --> 3:03:50.720]  on you? Or why don't we just take everything over? And they said, okay, let's do it.
[3:03:51.520 --> 3:03:55.200]  And they've done it. And they bring the drugs in and they put your young people in prison,
[3:03:55.200 --> 3:04:00.080]  making widgets. And then the idiot population says, oh, make them prisoners work. They're lazy.
[3:04:00.080 --> 3:04:06.320]  What you don't know is, is that those prisoners then compete against you. Those prisoners then
[3:04:06.320 --> 3:04:11.520]  take your jobs because they're working for 20 cents an hour. How are you going to compete with
[3:04:11.520 --> 3:04:16.000]  that? The illegal work for five bucks an hour. The prisoner works for 20 cents an hour on average.
[3:04:16.000 --> 3:04:19.200]  What's going to happen to your job? What's going to happen to your economy? What's going to happen
[3:04:19.200 --> 3:04:25.760]  to your country? But up on that, we are change.org and info wars.com and prison.com. You can look
[3:04:25.760 --> 3:04:31.120]  at the story. We are changed assaulted by police in Louisville. And it just lets you know another
[3:04:31.120 --> 3:04:36.640]  nail in the coffin is the US sinks under the ocean of third world despotism and becomes a
[3:04:36.640 --> 3:04:42.640]  banana boat republic with a hyper techno police state overlay. Couldn't be a worse thing happened.
[3:04:45.520 --> 3:04:53.600]  It is a big idea. A new world order in the near future. Earth is dominated by powers of
[3:04:53.600 --> 3:05:01.120]  government. It's known as the builder bird. But their objective being world domination. For thousands
[3:05:01.120 --> 3:05:07.120]  of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great
[3:05:07.120 --> 3:05:16.640]  dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan

[3:07:44.800 --> 3:07:51.120]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a
[3:07:51.120 --> 3:08:05.120]  war on for your mind. We are change Ohio.
[3:08:10.320 --> 3:08:14.800]  Head press passes were accredited got up during the question and answer for press for Oliver
[3:08:14.800 --> 3:08:22.000]  North and asked about continuity of government and they asked politely. It's been reported by
[3:08:22.000 --> 3:08:26.800]  three of them we've talked to and then they were followed because you know I mean imagine all these
[3:08:26.800 --> 3:08:30.400]  cops are trained to fight terror. They've been taught in all their manuals and training that
[3:08:30.400 --> 3:08:35.360]  anybody that talks about FEMA camps or martial law you know they're being trained for it is a
[3:08:35.360 --> 3:08:40.080]  terrorist and so they tackle them grab the cameras freak out talk about how they're going to set them
[3:08:40.080 --> 3:08:45.680]  up how they're going in for felonies for videotape and stuff I mean you know that there's no real
[3:08:45.680 --> 3:08:51.440]  terrorist but they all watch 24 and think they're jack bower so the press is now al-qaeda it's like
[3:08:51.440 --> 3:08:55.120]  they'll kill you in Mexico if you report on government drug dealing they're starting to kill
[3:08:55.120 --> 3:09:00.400]  reporters here and kill cops here AP reports they've told our cops work for us or you die and our
[3:09:00.400 --> 3:09:06.160]  cops are saying we work for you it's a nation run by fear and cowardice and the death squads are run
[3:09:06.160 --> 3:09:11.840]  by the CIA and they as we told you three years ago and it's now mainstream news the media acts
[3:09:11.840 --> 3:09:16.720]  like all the death squads our government trained they're now operating in Texas and Indiana and
[3:09:16.720 --> 3:09:20.720]  all they're killing people and oh my god our government doesn't control them they trained
[3:09:20.720 --> 3:09:25.840]  them another out of control they've always controlled them and now it's time for us to be
[3:09:25.840 --> 3:09:35.840]  third world slaves but I thought I would go ahead and go to the document cam so I can show people
[3:09:38.800 --> 3:09:42.720]  what's going on here I was going to show them a video but I don't even have my controller in
[3:09:42.720 --> 3:09:46.960]  here I got to get that switcher in here this isn't working I don't know where the controller is I
[3:09:46.960 --> 3:09:52.640]  wanted to show people this video for prisonplanet.tv viewers that are out there and I don't have a
[3:09:52.640 --> 3:09:58.000]  little switcher oh here it is why should I even show people this stuff with north they don't even
[3:09:58.000 --> 3:10:02.480]  care just don't look you're all gonna get it okay all of you that like the system all of you that
[3:10:02.480 --> 3:10:10.080]  think it's real funny here's the video of it from my film police stay to the takeover okay here it is
[3:10:11.200 --> 3:10:18.480]  turn north in your work at the NSC well you're not assigned at one time to work on plans for the
[3:10:18.480 --> 3:10:22.880]  continuity of government in the event of a major disaster Mr. Chairman
[3:10:26.320 --> 3:10:33.520]  I believe that question touches upon a highly sensitive and classified area so may I request
[3:10:33.520 --> 3:10:45.280]  that you not touch upon that sir I was particularly concerned because I read in Miami papers and
[3:10:45.280 --> 3:10:56.480]  several others that there had been a plan developed by that same agency a contingency plan in the event
[3:10:56.480 --> 3:11:01.600]  of emergency that would suspend the American Constitution and I was deeply concerned about it
[3:11:01.600 --> 3:11:09.520]  I'm wondering if that was the area in which he had worked I most respectfully request that that
[3:11:09.520 --> 3:11:16.160]  matter not be touched upon at this stage if we wish to get into this uncertain arrangements can be
[3:11:16.160 --> 3:11:23.440]  made for an executive session and tragically the only member who got closed was Jack Brooks and he
[3:11:23.440 --> 3:11:28.320]  was stopped by the chairman so the truth of the matter is that yes you do have those standby
[3:11:28.320 --> 3:11:34.480]  provisions and the planes are there and the statutory emergency plans are there whereby
[3:11:34.480 --> 3:11:46.640]  you could in the name of stopping terrorism apprehend invoke the military and arrest Americans
[3:11:46.640 --> 3:11:55.680]  and hold them in detention camps okay you can just type in Oliver North FEMA camps in and
[3:11:56.240 --> 3:12:01.520]  look if I sound mad on air I'm not mad at the people to network anybody here I'm mad I mean I
[3:12:01.520 --> 3:12:07.280]  I mean it makes me sick looking at Oliver North I mean you know this this fake American this fake
[3:12:07.280 --> 3:12:13.760]  Marine this fake Patriot all they're doing is killing the country something Hitler couldn't do
[3:12:13.760 --> 3:12:19.040]  something Stalin couldn't do something Mount couldn't do and they they wrap themselves in the flag
[3:12:19.040 --> 3:12:24.800]  while they do it they scientifically manipulate you and have these things like war stories and
[3:12:24.800 --> 3:12:31.920]  associate themselves with Audie Murphy and other heroes it's disgusting it's disgusting to watch
[3:12:31.920 --> 3:12:36.240]  them get away with this over and over again and they're just taking the whole country they're
[3:12:36.240 --> 3:12:45.120]  taking the whole thing down I mean this this tour my guts out this morning when I read this story
[3:12:45.120 --> 3:13:00.400]  out of the New York Times where they're just happily reporting that's up on the document
[3:13:00.400 --> 3:13:08.400]  camera folks that are watching online right now as prices rise crime tipsters work over time that's
[3:13:08.400 --> 3:13:16.480]  right that's their job it says and uh yeah I mean I told the story just last week about one of the
[3:13:16.480 --> 3:13:21.920]  famous cases I mean I always use cases that are well known there's literally thousands I've seen
[3:13:21.920 --> 3:13:28.080]  until I see it now in a newspaper and I I get sad I get upset I get anxious my heart starts beating
[3:13:28.080 --> 3:13:32.240]  because I want justice to be done I want bad guys to go to jail I can't believe we're in this much
[3:13:32.240 --> 3:13:36.160]  trouble it's like we're just going deeper and deeper down a black hole I know we're not coming
[3:13:36.160 --> 3:13:42.960]  out of about you know the guy in North Carolina that owned the a couple of nurseries for plants
[3:13:43.600 --> 3:13:48.560]  and every year he went to Texas to Houston to buy yopans that were going to be shipped by 18 Wheeler
[3:13:49.600 --> 3:13:55.680]  but they gave him a discount of he paid cash and he had $14,000 and he happened to whip it out
[3:13:55.680 --> 3:14:00.320]  some cash out to pay at the airport and the one that said was making 30 something grand a year
[3:14:00.320 --> 3:14:04.720]  but she made 200 grand a year in getting a percentage of the seizures no drugs found no
[3:14:04.720 --> 3:14:08.880]  criminal record and they just took his money and he never got it back on the courts just said
[3:14:08.880 --> 3:14:13.920]  doesn't matter if you don't have drugs or just we're going to take it and they don't stop folks
[3:14:13.920 --> 3:14:18.240]  and there's famous cases of the DPS in Texas pulling over an 80-something-year-old woman
[3:14:19.520 --> 3:14:24.400]  who carried around $4,000 cash with her as most old-time women would carry a lot of money around
[3:14:24.400 --> 3:14:29.040]  with them back from the Depression days turned out she was an heiress of some oil barren hundreds
[3:14:29.040 --> 3:14:33.840]  of millions but hey pull her over brand new Cadillac come over to her car they say mind if we
[3:14:33.840 --> 3:14:39.040]  search she says okay officer they get the three four grand in her wallet and they just take it
[3:14:39.040 --> 3:14:44.640]  I mean that's what America is folks they'll come in all the time when they raid people for guns
[3:14:44.640 --> 3:14:48.560]  that aren't even illegal they go ahead and take your gold bust in your safe they just put it right
[3:14:48.560 --> 3:14:56.320]  in their pockets right in front of you and it's admitted I mean I can sit here for a thousand
[3:14:56.320 --> 3:15:01.680]  hours reading mainstream news articles about police selling each other drugs to seize bars
[3:15:01.680 --> 3:15:06.080]  and restaurants that they then own and run or stealing people's houses planting rugs on them
[3:15:06.080 --> 3:15:10.080]  or stealing your land and killing you hell a lot of times if they decide they want your ranch
[3:15:10.080 --> 3:15:13.680]  they'll just cops will come right out and kill you and then use it as their deer hunting ranch I
[3:15:13.680 --> 3:15:18.800]  mean they'll just walk you out back and line you up and boom blow the back of your head right off
[3:15:19.520 --> 3:15:24.880]  and I mean you know I mean it's the most criminal group there is out there now that's the higher
[3:15:24.880 --> 3:15:29.760]  up cops in certain corrupt divisions that the average cops just outright and take its and following
[3:15:29.760 --> 3:15:35.920]  orders and and they're not corrupt and they're just out raising money and writing tickets
[3:15:36.960 --> 3:15:43.200]  for the uh to hire more cops to I just can't handle anymore I mean I really can't I want to
[3:15:43.200 --> 3:15:47.520]  take your calls I know I've got a bunch of you that are holding John and Chris and Mark and
[3:15:49.040 --> 3:15:55.360]  bunch of other people is this land of the free home of the brave I mean is this what our country's
[3:15:55.360 --> 3:16:04.000]  all about as prices rise crime temperatures work overtime to gas prices foreclosure rates and the
[3:16:04.000 --> 3:16:10.480]  cost of rice add this rising cost indicator the number of tips to the police from people hoping
[3:16:10.480 --> 3:16:17.120]  to collect reward money calls to the southwest florida crime stoppers hotline in the first quarter
[3:16:17.120 --> 3:16:22.880]  of the year were up 30 percent over last year San Antonio had a 44 increase cities and towns
[3:16:22.880 --> 3:16:31.040]  from Detroit to Omaha to um ufort north carolina all report increases of 25 percent or more in
[3:16:31.040 --> 3:16:35.920]  the first quarter with tipsters telling operators they need the money for rent light bills and baby
[3:16:35.920 --> 3:16:41.200]  formula the biggest part of our economy's presence after that it's a military after that it's
[3:16:41.200 --> 3:16:48.320]  surveillance I mean that's what we are we are the most evil wicked pathetic degenerate scum filled
[3:16:48.320 --> 3:16:53.120]  nation of trash and I'm not even talking about the police of the government I mean the general
[3:16:53.120 --> 3:16:59.200]  public are just just mindless gibbering monkeys and let me tell you something they set off nukes
[3:16:59.200 --> 3:17:04.240]  and then tell the gibbering population to put americans in camps and that they'll get their
[3:17:04.240 --> 3:17:09.680]  milk and honey back they'll do it if you don't think that the great depression 90 percent of us
[3:17:09.680 --> 3:17:15.600]  are 85 lived on farms that can feed ourselves and and and and thousands starved millions when hungry
[3:17:15.600 --> 3:17:21.280]  uh right now five percenters can take care of themselves they'll they're gonna be demonic animals

[3:25:49.120 --> 3:25:54.720]  john in ohio than chris mark and others shallow you're on the air go ahead so that i like
[3:25:55.840 --> 3:26:00.080]  before i get to my working against this privatization in my local city here
[3:26:00.800 --> 3:26:05.440]  you know me as someone who's an unaffiliated free thinker who agrees with a march and socialist
[3:26:05.440 --> 3:26:14.560]  analysis but i think that in certain ways we've got you know my original exposure to a march and
[3:26:14.560 --> 3:26:20.800]  socialist analysis was way back in the 60s and 70s with the progressive labor party plp.org if
[3:26:20.800 --> 3:26:26.160]  you want to look them up but they they were the first one to introduce me long before you did to
[3:26:26.160 --> 3:26:32.320]  the eugenics programs of the uh the rockefeller interest on wall street and the bank of london
[3:26:32.320 --> 3:26:37.120]  and the central intelligence agency the world bank uh the imf they were the ones that first
[3:26:37.120 --> 3:26:42.480]  introduced me to false flag terrorism they were the ones that introduced me to operation gladio
[3:26:42.480 --> 3:26:46.240]  way back in the 70s i know but you'll never listen that the globalist funded communism in
[3:26:46.240 --> 3:26:51.040]  their own documents it's just impossible for you just deny all those facts and just say it isn't
[3:26:51.040 --> 3:26:56.400]  true so fine believe what you want john well the the points i've just made i think our speak for
[3:26:56.400 --> 3:27:01.920]  themselves that you know this is there's a clear uh yeah but the communists didn't the communists did
[3:27:01.920 --> 3:27:07.440]  false flag events too john the point i'm making here is everything you said along the the point
[3:27:07.440 --> 3:27:13.680]  of eugenics has been in long monographs i've seen a plp way back in the 60s and 70s and that's why
[3:27:13.680 --> 3:27:17.840]  i agree with 60 percent of what you're saying and i disagree with 40 percent i think you're
[3:27:17.840 --> 3:27:22.880]  doing great work there but i think in many ways you're you're contradictory because for instance
[3:27:22.880 --> 3:27:29.440]  when you had uh david j smith on criticizing uh chavez and by implication even morales in
[3:27:29.440 --> 3:27:35.600]  uh in well let's let's get one thing different hey john john hold on a minute number one
[3:27:36.400 --> 3:27:42.320]  this is not some monolithic show and i don't agree completely with every guest i have on
[3:27:42.320 --> 3:27:46.560]  just like i don't completely agree with a lot of things you're saying i mean a lot of these other
[3:27:46.560 --> 3:27:52.640]  shows are monolithic and it's all just one view or one idea we're having a large college
[3:27:52.640 --> 3:27:57.600]  debate here go ahead okay what i'm just saying though is that this this this kind of knee jerk
[3:27:57.600 --> 3:28:03.440]  piggybacking on on generations of anti-communist corporate propaganda leads us into actually
[3:28:03.440 --> 3:28:08.720]  opposing the very things we we support for instance uh even morales and bolivia actually
[3:28:08.720 --> 3:28:13.760]  opposed the uh privatization of the water after there was a revolutionary upheaval because the
[3:28:13.760 --> 3:28:18.240]  peasants and the workers down there couldn't even live because of what was going on i understand i
[3:28:18.240 --> 3:28:23.280]  understand that i understand that communism is quote the solution in latin america to a lot of
[3:28:23.280 --> 3:28:29.200]  the wrongs of neo feudalism uh but uh you know that's kind of like signature for cyanide is uh
[3:28:29.200 --> 3:28:35.440]  arsenic and and look i appreciate your call john i mean i i just you never address carol quickly
[3:28:35.440 --> 3:28:40.400]  in the documents and lord millner and the fact that they funded the communists to destroy the czar
[3:28:41.840 --> 3:28:46.640]  and that's just a fact and and and so i don't believe it's a communist conspiracy i believe
[3:28:46.640 --> 3:28:52.000]  communism is one tool like radical islam the wahhabist are created by the british intel uh
[3:28:52.000 --> 3:28:57.040]  just like uh you know all these major groups are it's called the great game and that's what carol
[3:28:57.040 --> 3:29:02.480]  quickly writes about and uh and i mean that's really their corporate documents that's their
[3:29:02.480 --> 3:29:07.440]  corporate history their record and so while we're look look i reject your left-right paradigm
[3:29:08.640 --> 3:29:12.960]  just because i criticize what you know as is the right wing fascist structure
[3:29:12.960 --> 3:29:18.880]  it doesn't mean that i then embrace the other wing of the same bird of prey the left wing
[3:29:18.880 --> 3:29:25.920]  i reject it all it's part of a false paradigm a false political template before the bankers put
[3:29:25.920 --> 3:29:30.640]  out there to send for 120 years ago and then it became dominant in the last 80 people knew it as
[3:29:30.640 --> 3:29:38.480]  liberty versus tyranny i'm for liberty period we're on the march the empires on the run

[3:35:01.360 --> 3:35:05.680]  not drinking and driving not using any pharmacological drugs not using any illegal drugs
[3:35:05.680 --> 3:35:12.400]  uh and and and just really realizing that the world is very dangerous now there are cockroaches
[3:35:12.400 --> 3:35:18.320]  and scum and trash and parasites everywhere and the only revenge is living well the only
[3:35:18.320 --> 3:35:23.280]  revenge is making it through this and god help us when they fully implode the economy the general
[3:35:23.280 --> 3:35:28.640]  public are just going to be absolute demons and uh it is just we are a nation of trash
[3:35:30.160 --> 3:35:35.200]  it really is true and and the cancer is growing i i don't see any way the country can can can
[3:35:35.200 --> 3:35:41.440]  reverse the course uh it it's uh you know to see innocence framed you know in my new film
[3:35:41.440 --> 3:35:44.800]  truth rising it won't be out for a few months because we're still adding some things to it
[3:35:44.800 --> 3:35:50.000]  but i show screenings of the last two nights uh you know i mean we got we got police coming up
[3:35:50.000 --> 3:35:54.080]  and saying that's a gun your camera's a gun i'm gonna arrest you for this gun and laughing
[3:35:54.080 --> 3:35:59.200]  with a v8 with with a dv cam tape and you know you can probably go to prison for a camera now
[3:35:59.200 --> 3:36:03.360]  they'll say it's a laser beam they'll say it's kryptonite i mean i don't know they'll say it's
[3:36:03.360 --> 3:36:08.640]  a bomb a nuclear bomb coming up and saying we know you don't have bombs but we're gonna say you have
[3:36:08.640 --> 3:36:14.160]  bombs no that's that's what we are folks i mean they always frame people but now they just do it on
[3:36:14.160 --> 3:36:19.920]  tape and uh to know that these young men went in there and they just brought they got press passes
[3:36:19.920 --> 3:36:26.080]  they were polite uh they brought up cognitive government concentration camps uh to north
[3:36:26.080 --> 3:36:35.840]  and uh they then were leaving and uh here to just because i mean i i i adam cuttington this happened
[3:36:35.840 --> 3:36:40.560]  to with three other guys called into the sunday show and told part of it and then i heard and read
[3:36:40.560 --> 3:36:45.520]  the rest of it it's up on info wars dot com right now and uh it was even worse than what he was saying
[3:36:45.520 --> 3:36:49.680]  because they split them all up you know telling him oh you put one of those memory sticks because
[3:36:49.680 --> 3:36:52.880]  you had one memory strip in the camera one in his pocket they then searched him after they stole
[3:36:52.880 --> 3:36:58.000]  the camera said oh you got another memory stick that was that's federal evidence because this is a
[3:36:58.000 --> 3:37:02.320]  government facility that makes it homeland security federal you're gonna get a felony for this memory
[3:37:02.320 --> 3:37:07.680]  stick in your pocket and i'm surprised they didn't say it was you know a anti-matter death star or
[3:37:07.680 --> 3:37:12.720]  something i mean you know i mean that's what they do it's just all about lies all about criminality
[3:37:12.720 --> 3:37:17.840]  all about them ruling and just dominating and being bullies and being scum and they're hiring
[3:37:17.840 --> 3:37:23.200]  felons and hiring on me we're this is bad folks they're building camps i have it in the news today
[3:37:23.200 --> 3:37:29.760]  here and i know we got loaded phones i'm gonna get to you it just i can't believe this is happening
[3:37:29.760 --> 3:37:34.640]  and they just incrementally do it let's go to adam cuttington adam recap what happened to you
[3:37:34.640 --> 3:37:38.880]  and then now talking to the other guys when they split you up what what they're saying because
[3:37:39.520 --> 3:37:44.400]  i mean our press is attacked we don't even have press now they've called for arresting we are
[3:37:44.400 --> 3:37:49.760]  changed attacking killing they've called for you to be taken to secret camps on national news that's
[3:37:49.760 --> 3:37:55.280]  a white house talking point it scares them so much to have citizens come up at public events and
[3:37:55.280 --> 3:38:01.360]  embarrass them with real issues that that they are escalating the violence towards us and uh people
[3:38:01.360 --> 3:38:05.920]  google oliver north i want people to follow him everywhere he goes go to every event and bring
[3:38:05.920 --> 3:38:12.640]  up first amendment questions to him but bring more people uh and uh i mean this is just incredible
[3:38:12.640 --> 3:38:18.480]  because if we let the chilling effect win if we let them win it's over adam yeah great to be with
[3:38:18.480 --> 3:38:22.320]  you again now uh recap what happened and get me all those other developments because i heard
[3:38:22.320 --> 3:38:27.280]  you guys last time on another show with cosmos uh really getting into it all uh because it was
[3:38:27.280 --> 3:38:34.160]  even worse than what you were saying on my show yeah um from just being in my own perspective
[3:38:34.160 --> 3:38:38.640]  and i was splitting pretty much after that happened you know i didn't get um even everybody else's
[3:38:38.640 --> 3:38:49.360]  uh full account um uh like i said yesterday we um had confronted oliver north uh first on continuity
[3:38:49.360 --> 3:38:58.320]  of government uh we supported new investigation of 9-11 in camps uh then ted newton on 9-11 uh
[3:38:58.320 --> 3:39:04.240]  when we were about to leave uh we went we've seen that oliver north was doing a book signing
[3:39:04.240 --> 3:39:08.880]  in the hall inside to go over and hang them literature and let's be clear a lot of these
[3:39:08.880 --> 3:39:13.760]  guys are former iraq troops from the last five years you go to a death camp for and that's in
[3:39:13.760 --> 3:39:19.280]  the news today for a secret execution before you're thrown into a limepit for even criticizing
[3:39:19.280 --> 3:39:24.320]  the government in iraq under the democracy and so for them that's why taking you to a limepit
[3:39:24.320 --> 3:39:28.560]  in the near future and i'm not joking folks i don't i don't kid around the show or exaggerate
[3:39:28.560 --> 3:39:34.240]  they are training to murder you and your family and we must stop them now but go ahead finish your story
[3:39:34.240 --> 3:39:39.760]  all right uh they i stood across the hall when they went up to the table to get the uh
[3:39:40.320 --> 3:39:44.080]  to get that event from another angle and they ended up swarming at that time
[3:39:44.640 --> 3:39:54.800]  uh they confiscated our press passes and told us to leave we were walking out the hall and uh
[3:39:54.800 --> 3:40:02.320]  uh the camera was actually trapped the officer behind is all trapped matching the camera out of
[3:40:02.320 --> 3:40:09.840]  Sam's hand that's why he jerked back on it and uh was taken to the ground jerked back on a god
[3:40:09.840 --> 3:40:16.080]  when he snuck up and grabbed at the camera oh my god you you you even looked at a god
[3:40:16.080 --> 3:40:21.680]  moses had to look at a bush you were looking at them i mean he just came up from behind them
[3:40:21.680 --> 3:40:27.280]  oh oh you know just from behind them and try grabbing i mean what would be normal reaction
[3:40:27.920 --> 3:40:33.440]  uh so anyways that's when i i believe they tried provoking an incident and actually
[3:40:33.440 --> 3:40:39.440]  taking him to the ground um and putting him in cuffs we're continuing to be let out bad
[3:40:41.200 --> 3:40:44.880]  outside cody deep tried to have you seen the pictures where they cut him up
[3:40:44.880 --> 3:40:51.280]  yeah i've seen the hand uh the picture of the hand well that's what i'll cut against well tell
[3:40:51.280 --> 3:40:58.720]  folks what else happened uh and cody was trying to document uh two officers uh rushed him
[3:40:59.600 --> 3:41:06.000]  uh got his camera uh they proceeded to take all of our cameras at that time take our information
[3:41:06.000 --> 3:41:12.400]  or take our memory sticks out of them uh or uh tape CDs what have you uh
[3:41:12.400 --> 3:41:18.080]  uh delete our internal memory take our batteries out of them third world cesspit
[3:41:19.120 --> 3:41:25.600]  now let's be clear you had official press passes we had press passes that were acquired
[3:41:25.600 --> 3:41:34.560]  weeks before through the nra public affairs office because on the nr uh nr a i la i believe
[3:41:34.560 --> 3:41:42.880]  dot org uh website now that's a national national um registration uh assault group go ahead
[3:41:44.080 --> 3:41:49.520]  um i said it was open to the press so i called gave the credentials they were waiting for us
[3:41:49.520 --> 3:41:58.480]  when we got there and everything was fine uh so anyways after they take our memory and our batteries
[3:41:58.480 --> 3:42:04.480]  will have you um they kind of get us off to different sides threaten us with different things uh
[3:42:04.480 --> 3:42:10.720]  the code is threatened with uh federal i believe class d felony for uh tampering with evidence
[3:42:10.720 --> 3:42:16.240]  supposedly because he tried removing the memory stick from his camera before tampering with evidence
[3:42:16.240 --> 3:42:20.240]  oh so they were claiming a crime was committed with the cameras see how they just make stuff up
[3:42:20.240 --> 3:42:27.360]  just totally made up false charges official oppression uh have you learned the names of
[3:42:27.360 --> 3:42:32.880]  any of these dart bags or they wouldn't give it to you i they wouldn't give us any information
[3:42:32.880 --> 3:42:38.080]  on the uh officer that yeah they're just they're just gonna stay down to the ground they're just
[3:42:38.080 --> 3:42:41.760]  going to steal your equipment that's probably wouldn't even a cop they're just going to steal
[3:42:41.760 --> 3:42:47.840]  your equipment that's it and they're just shut up shut up so what else happened uh
[3:42:49.280 --> 3:42:52.880]  like i said they were starting this with felonies what have you federal felonies because it was
[3:42:52.880 --> 3:43:02.480]  state property um and uh they erased all of our memories gave us the cameras back and
[3:43:03.040 --> 3:43:06.240]  release salmon just told us to get out here bandage from the property for life
[3:43:09.840 --> 3:43:17.040]  and we went our way from there but uh the entire event i mean literally minutes before we were
[3:43:17.040 --> 3:43:23.600]  watching Ted Nugent upstairs talk about uh kill any type carjacker anyone you see committed crime
[3:43:23.600 --> 3:43:31.520]  with uh little metro police department standing right next to him smiling but uh we go downstairs
[3:43:31.520 --> 3:43:37.760]  try to use our first amendment uh are completely value violated i mean
[3:43:41.360 --> 3:43:45.760]  yeah it's we're way far gone i got an article here where there's not one million people now
[3:43:45.760 --> 3:43:51.920]  in the terror database it's eight million oh we're all terrorists and the cops are training
[3:43:51.920 --> 3:43:57.520]  to fight roadside bombs i mean give me a break folks it's all made up to federalize everything
[3:43:57.520 --> 3:44:00.480]  and they're gonna push and push till people fight back and then they're gonna say see
[3:44:00.480 --> 3:44:05.760]  there's terrorists everywhere you know oh this father won't let you take his three-year-old
[3:44:06.480 --> 3:44:14.000]  for no reason oh he's a terrorist oh i'm i'm the authority i'm i'm just so sick of all these do
[3:44:14.000 --> 3:44:20.160]  nothing nobody people with low IQs that then rule over us and just have their way with us
[3:44:20.160 --> 3:44:26.560]  while the banker is set up on high over us i mean aren't you sick of it adam i'm completely sick i'm
[3:44:26.560 --> 3:44:33.520]  fed up i'm sick of my stomach brother yeah i mean it's not even an anger or rage anymore i'm just like
[3:44:35.280 --> 3:44:40.240]  uh i mean i guess you haven't heard me read the new york times article where people are turning
[3:44:40.240 --> 3:44:45.200]  in their grandchildren for money right that's how people make their money in america now it's tattletail
[3:44:45.200 --> 3:44:56.720]  lines it's ridiculous it's it's the police state listen to this for tips that bring results programs
[3:44:56.720 --> 3:45:02.560]  in most places pay 50 to a thousand dollars with some jurisdictions giving bonuses for help solving
[3:45:02.560 --> 3:45:07.600]  the most serious crimes and extra gun bounty if a weapon is recovered that's why the carpet cleaner
[3:45:07.600 --> 3:45:13.280]  guy saw a shotgun on a rack on the wall you know seven eight years ago and called the police on me
[3:45:13.280 --> 3:45:18.000]  didn't matter he thought guns were illegal and he was going to get some money and sussex county the
[3:45:18.000 --> 3:45:24.160]  average payment for a tip that were results in arrest is 400 dollars but then when your car gets
[3:45:24.160 --> 3:45:30.480]  stolen they won't come out you gotta i mean it's just sick a snitch society i am ashamed of this
[3:45:30.480 --> 3:45:37.520]  country what about you hi i'm right there with you brother i mean um you know the cops don't even
[3:45:37.520 --> 3:45:43.040]  come out to domestic disturbance or what have you but am i using their first amendment uh i mean
[3:45:43.040 --> 3:45:49.120]  it's what it's form you know no god that's that's evil you don't talk you don't ask questions uh
[3:45:49.120 --> 3:45:53.280]  listen to this usually you deliver the money in an unmarked car and meet them somewhere he said
[3:45:53.280 --> 3:45:57.840]  but these people come right to the office and walk right through the front door so see you know i mean
[3:45:57.840 --> 3:46:02.400]  that's what cops do now they just it's all secret police activity have been totally warped there used
[3:46:02.400 --> 3:46:06.960]  to be something for you know bank robber or for some famous you know killer cop killer there'd be a
[3:46:06.960 --> 3:46:11.760]  reward now it's just for everything some crime stoppers coordinator said the program appeals to
[3:46:11.760 --> 3:46:19.120]  community spirit community spirit how degenerate and emphasizes that on everyone who calls in
[3:46:20.560 --> 3:46:25.600]  was after money but their advertising makes no bones about the benefits of a good tip now here
[3:46:25.600 --> 3:46:30.560]  in austin for at least 10 years they give every elementary and middle school student by a fifth
[3:46:30.560 --> 3:46:34.560]  grade they give them a card and they get 200 bucks when they turn family members in and they just
[3:46:34.560 --> 3:46:39.280]  teach them turn your mommy and daddy and and then the parents send their children to this place
[3:46:39.280 --> 3:46:44.240]  where where your children are being taught to look for you doing something wrong i mean this is
[3:46:44.240 --> 3:46:50.640]  ridiculous if we live in a prison with a bunch of drug dealers running it i mean this is sick
[3:46:50.640 --> 3:46:57.280]  it's not enough for you to bring the drugs in you have to then all right and what would you like
