[00:00.000 --> 00:14.720]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.720 --> 00:36.720]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen we are
[00:36.720 --> 00:46.960]  live it is thursday the 29th day of november 2012 and we are going to be here for the next three
[00:46.960 --> 00:52.400]  hours you can see a detailed list of the guests we have on today up at info wars.com and prison
[00:52.400 --> 01:00.160]  planet.com the top right hand corner but josh abraham the son of the co-author of none dare call
[01:00.160 --> 01:06.720]  a conspiracy gary allen and larry abraham the quintessential primer to understand the new world
[01:06.720 --> 01:13.440]  order first published what in 1971 the book that really crystallized my awakening to a great extent
[01:13.440 --> 01:20.960]  you can't say one thing woke me up or any of us up but it's a process generally one son started
[01:20.960 --> 01:26.800]  politico and runs it gary allen's son larry abraham's son josh abraham is going to be
[01:26.800 --> 01:34.480]  joining us at the start of the next hour he is a former pro wakeboarder and a former sponsored
[01:34.480 --> 01:39.760]  snokes here he's been researching his father's work in depth for quite a while and the book was
[01:39.760 --> 01:43.680]  out of print there's i don't know over like 10 million of them out there until lately and we
[01:43.680 --> 01:48.240]  found folks that have republished it and so we're the only place you can really get it is at info
[01:48.240 --> 01:54.720]  wars.com but that's a side issue none dare call it conspiracy he's going to break some news that
[01:54.720 --> 02:01.280]  his father told him on his deathbed and these guys were hooked in with congressman larry mcdonnell
[02:01.280 --> 02:08.000]  they were hooked in with the patriot movement in congress and and i mean they laid out in this
[02:08.000 --> 02:14.240]  short little i don't know what is a 130 page book the entire battle plan from 1971 and guess what
[02:14.240 --> 02:18.560]  almost all of it came through it all came through exactly like they said they would up to a point
[02:18.560 --> 02:24.320]  we haven't gotten to the final in game yet and his dad also wrote a book called the greening about
[02:24.320 --> 02:35.440]  agenda 21 before it even had that name so just trailblazers amongst trailblazers real insiders
[02:36.080 --> 02:39.520]  so we're going to learn about what he told him on his deathbed and why he contacted us
[02:40.720 --> 02:52.240]  coming up today should be interesting to say the least and then gar smith who wrote nuclear roulette
[02:52.240 --> 02:58.960]  the truth about the most dangerous energy source on earth and again i've never been anti nuclear
[02:58.960 --> 03:04.720]  these companies run these things now until they melt down 90 what is it two percent of them according
[03:04.720 --> 03:09.840]  to the u.s energy department they had meant worldwide the 400 plus reactors worldwide most of them here
[03:09.840 --> 03:13.680]  in the u.s or a lot of them about half of them technically france has got a lot too so japan
[03:14.320 --> 03:19.280]  are leaking and now they just announced you know earlier this year when they had leaks
[03:19.280 --> 03:22.560]  in southern california had a big reactor that you said you know what we're going to turn the
[03:22.560 --> 03:28.640]  alarms off now in the city that have been scaring people just we're not going to tell you anymore
[03:28.640 --> 03:35.200]  when we're off gassing radiation so i'm against nuclear now let's just get that clear because
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.560]  it's like i'm for the death penalty but you can't trust a corrupt government to implement it when
[03:40.560 --> 03:45.680]  they're known to frame people in mass and know they're sending people to the gas chamber or to
[03:45.680 --> 03:53.280]  lethal injection they're totally innocent so i'm not i can't support the death penalty as it stands
[03:53.280 --> 03:58.480]  because criminals run the government it's the same thing with nuclear they won't ever deploy the new
[03:58.480 --> 04:04.560]  safer technology and they've just decided that radiation is not bad for us so that is coming
[04:04.560 --> 04:08.240]  up in the third hour we'll open the phones up coming up the next segment i'll give the number
[04:08.240 --> 04:16.160]  out there is so much news we told you this was coming look goldman sacks jp morgan and others
[04:16.160 --> 04:22.000]  they finance both obama and romney because they have an agenda and we get caught up and romney
[04:22.000 --> 04:32.240]  and obama bush clinton all this stuff uh george w uh senator carrey they are frontmen they're
[04:32.240 --> 04:36.400]  frontmen you know they're like presidents of companies usually ceo's actually run things
[04:36.400 --> 04:41.120]  and then presidents go to the pr functions that are the spokespeople well that's what our presidents
[04:41.120 --> 04:47.520]  have become and they're corporate frontmen teleprompter readers uh and they're saying
[04:47.520 --> 04:55.520]  they're gonna increase taxes they're not just income tax vat national sales taxes and carbon
[04:55.520 --> 05:03.360]  taxes get ready they're coming for us millions of people are going to get sick this winter from
[05:03.360 --> 05:08.560]  colds flu and other illnesses don't be one of them protect yourself with supernatural silver
[05:08.560 --> 05:13.840]  a revolutionary new broad spectrum antibacterial solution recent advances in silver technology
[05:13.840 --> 05:19.200]  have resulted in a silver solution that can be used daily to prevent bacteria viruses mold and

[08:15.600 --> 08:36.960]  from the front lines of the info war yes my friends it is the 29th day of november 2012
[08:37.840 --> 08:44.640]  and i am seeing a lot of criticism on our youtube channel and in comments at prisonplanet.com
[08:44.640 --> 08:49.600]  and info wars dot com in the stories not a ton but but still quite a bit people are
[08:49.600 --> 08:55.920]  genuinely some people a small minority are genuinely mad that i don't believe there's
[08:55.920 --> 09:02.240]  going to be a pole shift or sea levels rising by 50 feet or more some are saying hundreds of feet
[09:02.800 --> 09:11.520]  on december 21st and that i think the whole thing is absolute uh baloney and uh according to a lot
[09:11.520 --> 09:18.720]  of you out there in 22 days from now 23 days from now uh we're all dead or close to it uh
[09:18.720 --> 09:26.880]  and i just do not believe that and i guarantee you that i will be not exonerated when this
[09:26.880 --> 09:31.760]  doesn't happen i will be hated even more by people that have bought into this ideology of into the
[09:31.760 --> 09:39.440]  world my problem with this end of the world stuff is that there's always a new one now 2000 2001
[09:39.440 --> 09:44.560]  planet x was going to kill us or you know the navy and the army put out that y2k was going to
[09:44.560 --> 09:50.160]  shut everything down they created that hype and then when people bought into it my listeners bullied
[09:50.160 --> 09:55.520]  me and convinced me i mean i said it was all baloney for a year to the last month and said oh
[09:55.520 --> 10:04.640]  looks like it may be real and i will not be bullied into saying that december 21st 2012
[10:04.640 --> 10:10.240]  is the end of the world so we're going to open the phones up again today in between the gas we've
[10:10.240 --> 10:15.680]  got coming up if you want to call in and give me your take on this i'm not saying the globalists
[10:15.680 --> 10:20.000]  don't believe in the occult i'm not saying that they aren't digging in and building bunkers i'm
[10:20.000 --> 10:26.320]  not saying that the hadron superconducting supercollider uh couldn't create a black hole or a
[10:26.320 --> 10:30.960]  particle they call a strangelet that basically creates something like a black hole that falls to
[10:30.960 --> 10:36.720]  the center of the earth that the area of greatest gravitational pull and mass and then starts pulling
[10:36.720 --> 10:42.640]  matter into it and then creates a gravity well and the whole earth implodes in on itself
[10:43.760 --> 10:49.760]  to a much smaller size basically killing all life on the planet many top physicists we've had on
[10:49.760 --> 10:54.240]  and have been in the news and people with major degrees people that have made proven discoveries
[10:54.800 --> 10:59.760]  have said that they're doing thousands of tests at hadron and and then and then the probability
[10:59.760 --> 11:05.600]  is that it's a low probability that one experiment will destroy the earth but if they do thousands
[11:06.160 --> 11:09.360]  they don't know what's going to happen and now they're discovering new types of matter
[11:10.080 --> 11:15.760]  they say they're discovering new particles they say that japan and the united states have
[11:15.760 --> 11:22.400]  created black holes in laboratories artificial suns in the last 30 years this has been done
[11:22.400 --> 11:28.000]  hundreds of times we know about and that's that's projects they're telling us about so
[11:28.000 --> 11:34.000]  i'm not saying that the establishment couldn't destroy the earth i'm not saying some super
[11:34.000 --> 11:41.360]  weaponized human pox based on mouse pox that kills over 98 percent of mammals that it's tailored to
[11:41.360 --> 11:44.720]  you can make it for rabbits you can make it for sheep you can make it for humans you can make
[11:44.720 --> 11:49.680]  it for rhesus monkeys now you can make it quite easily remember about seven years ago was big news
[11:49.680 --> 11:58.240]  when scientist australia released the dna sequencing on how to make it for any mammal
[11:58.960 --> 12:04.160]  and it was a big debate about should this have been released yeah obviously no no no no no
[12:05.120 --> 12:13.040]  but humans are creators and humans cannot help investigating i mean i i've plugged this probably
[12:13.040 --> 12:17.200]  a hundred times i'll plug it again it still airs occasionally on discovery channel it's trinity
[12:17.200 --> 12:22.880]  and beyond narrated by william shatner and again i knew everything basically in that film was i've
[12:22.880 --> 12:29.920]  read quite a few books on the atomic and the nuclear and hydrogen age i find cyclotrons and
[12:29.920 --> 12:38.400]  nuclear piles and atomic piles and and superconducting super colliders just absolutely uh riveting
[12:38.400 --> 12:47.120]  information space-based weapons x-ray lasers uh smart pebble uh particle beams other directed
[12:47.120 --> 12:52.480]  energy weapons systems i have sought out the former head of star wars interviewing many times
[12:53.120 --> 13:01.040]  colonel bob bowman dr bowman physicist engineer but i understand that well going back to the
[13:01.040 --> 13:06.320]  to the shatner document or we ought to we've got that document we ought to pull the clip and play it
[13:06.320 --> 13:12.960]  the united states alone hundreds of times detonated high-powered hydrogen bombs in the 60s and there's
[13:12.960 --> 13:19.840]  film of this in the atmosphere in the in the edge of space trying to blow a hole in the atmosphere
[13:19.840 --> 13:25.600]  to see if they could destroy the earth's atmosphere let me say that again they tried to blow a hole
[13:25.600 --> 13:31.600]  in the atmosphere and so that the atmosphere could be sucked into space did you did did you hear
[13:31.600 --> 13:37.600]  what i just said they tried to blow up the van ellen radiation belt too and they actually made it
[13:37.600 --> 13:46.560]  more radioactive they um they more than half the scientists at los alamos thought that the when
[13:46.560 --> 13:54.160]  they detonated the first a bomb secretly i had a bombing japan at harashima nakasaki in 1945
[13:54.960 --> 13:59.680]  half the scientists or more believed it was going to ignite the earth's atmosphere and burn the
[13:59.680 --> 14:04.320]  atmosphere off and they had underground bunkers with their own oxygen generators and things they
[14:04.320 --> 14:10.640]  were ready to go into show it's all about the power trip of these people yeah there's the headline
[14:10.640 --> 14:17.760]  large hadron collider won't destroy earth with planet eating black hole court says despite the
[14:17.760 --> 14:22.240]  fact a bunch of top physicists tried to block it and then just two days ago they come out in the
[14:22.240 --> 14:30.480]  new scientists and say oh we're making new matter new heavy matter oh heavy matter oh really max
[14:30.480 --> 14:37.520]  plank equations from 1900 envisioned exactly how atomic bombs would work we're 2012 folks it is
[14:37.520 --> 14:46.000]  buck roger time so don't get me wrong i'm not saying that the establishment might not destroy
[14:46.000 --> 14:52.080]  us all in their well i've got the quotes of some of the top physicists on the manhattan project
[14:52.080 --> 14:58.080]  bragging about how we would sit around drinking gin saying we'd become gods we'd become you know
[14:58.080 --> 15:02.160]  sheba the god of destruction and and there's recordings of that where they've done the interviews
[15:03.520 --> 15:07.680]  you can pull that up a bunch of them sitting around like grinding their teeth with these
[15:07.680 --> 15:13.760]  stars in their eyes and these are guys with you know 180 200 iqs idiot savant types and but they're
[15:13.760 --> 15:19.600]  they're they're they're missing something it's the ring of mordor they can't help but use it so
[15:19.600 --> 15:24.800]  let me get this straight here i'm not saying that we couldn't destroy ourselves and it becomes a
[15:24.800 --> 15:32.320]  probability the longer we go down this path i'm simply saying the mayan prophecy a doesn't say
[15:32.320 --> 15:36.400]  what the media says it says that it's the end of the world or that an asteroid's gonna hit us or
[15:36.400 --> 15:43.520]  a comet or the sun's gonna blow up doesn't say that b i don't believe even if they said that i
[15:43.520 --> 15:52.400]  wouldn't put stock in it but the establishment is digging in like it is the end of the world yeah
[15:52.400 --> 15:56.640]  guys you found a scientific american article x out of that photo there for people watching on
[15:56.640 --> 16:01.760]  prisonplanet.tv and i'll actually read them read them the headline there yeah go ahead and punch
[16:01.760 --> 16:06.720]  it back up for people high altitude nuclear explosions dangerous but not for the reasons
[16:08.400 --> 16:12.640]  genrich sites what is that about newt genrich has been warning the nation of the danger
[16:12.640 --> 16:17.840]  of an electromagnetic pulse emp a burst of radiation creating a high altitude nuclear explosion
[16:17.840 --> 16:22.160]  the pulse would take down electrical systems and then they go on to say that's not the issue
[16:24.640 --> 16:28.080]  that's a separate article you guys are looking at what i was talking about but i mean look look
[16:28.080 --> 16:34.400]  the point is these mad scientists run around tinkering with the genetic code of every major
[16:34.400 --> 16:43.520]  plant species animal species cross species and it's already created disastrous results and then
[16:43.520 --> 16:48.640]  they lecture us all day how we need to pay carbon taxes and shut off half our energy supply 51
[16:48.640 --> 16:53.200]  percent 52 percent of it because coal is bad even though it goes through all these filters
[16:53.200 --> 16:58.160]  and all that comes out is water vapor and carbon dioxide but they have george mobiot the big global
[16:58.160 --> 17:03.760]  has come out and say radiation is good for us i believe in nuclear power and let's have more
[17:03.760 --> 17:08.160]  disasters basically bizarre statements well they do that just to throw it in your face and acclimate
[17:08.160 --> 17:13.520]  you we're going to arrest you if you wash your car in san diego six years in jail hundred thousand
[17:13.520 --> 17:19.520]  dollar fine if soap suds hit the gutter neighbors call on them giant you'll get part of the fine
[17:19.520 --> 17:23.840]  you'll get 25 percent of the hundred thousand dollar fine associated press roiders i mean
[17:23.840 --> 17:28.480]  off the chart authoritarianism if your dog goes to the bathroom in the backyard six years in jail
[17:28.480 --> 17:34.560]  hundred thousand dollar fine second offense first offense what is it multi thousand dollar
[17:34.560 --> 17:40.320]  fines jail time if you don't pay it i mean your dog goes to the bathroom your neighbor
[17:40.320 --> 17:45.760]  tattles you're going to jail and they will put you in jail they've built new prisons that's our
[17:45.760 --> 17:51.840]  economy but if you want to take every major food source and splice it with animals and and
[17:51.840 --> 17:56.640]  pharmacological they have thousands of pharmacological crops thousands in corn alone you can
[17:56.640 --> 18:02.880]  make corn grow chemicals you can make it grow live aids virus hiv you can make it grow anything
[18:02.880 --> 18:09.200]  you want and the public is so stone age every time i talk about this we get letters we get calls
[18:09.200 --> 18:15.120]  guys on the street will go hey i hear your show i like what you do but i have a biology degree
[18:15.120 --> 18:19.440]  and you do not have you cannot splice plants and animals and i say to the people like when
[18:19.440 --> 18:26.320]  did you get your degree oh 1976 in one case and i went are you a practicing biologist no i'm in real
[18:26.320 --> 18:32.640]  estate well then don't come up and pat me on the shoulder hard and tell me i'm a liar because one
[18:32.640 --> 18:37.760]  time i told the story of conan's pizza the guy was like hey i don't like you lying and i was like
[18:37.760 --> 18:42.080]  about what and then i told the guy he started getting in my face and i said you just you just
[18:42.080 --> 18:48.400]  you just are on a power trip you better get out of my face right now see these people want to say
[18:48.400 --> 18:54.000]  i'm a liar because they don't want to admit how scary this is well you know what you live in your

[37:14.160 --> 37:20.960]  so they can say we're going to murder you like diana shot a video in her diary told her
[37:20.960 --> 37:25.200]  butler i talked to her cook personally i'm running it well i'm not going to get into what the point
[37:25.200 --> 37:29.200]  is that was off record actually just forget i said that besides you don't know which cook it was
[37:29.200 --> 37:32.800]  the point is is that it's on record they told a bunch of people and
[37:34.960 --> 37:39.760]  and you can pull up those articles that diana said charles says he's going to kill me if i
[37:39.760 --> 37:46.560]  don't start dating the you know this rich arab and uh then when she got pregnant oh my goodness
[37:46.560 --> 37:51.200]  do you you're dead of course royalty never kills members of the family they never locked people
[37:51.200 --> 37:55.120]  in the tower and smother little little little twins or anything i mean they know henry the eighth
[37:56.240 --> 38:00.640]  royalty never even you know the british royalty didn't knock off their cousins the zars in russia
[38:00.640 --> 38:04.320]  even though it's admitted they did funding the bolsheviks i mean none of that goes on everything's
[38:04.320 --> 38:11.600]  fine government loves you uh but uh we're gonna be getting into uh that report because mind control
[38:11.600 --> 38:16.720]  is real and when you look at james holmes ladies and gentlemen he was in a government mind control
[38:16.720 --> 38:23.760]  program and and was paid a grant every year his full salary and tuition he was a salaried
[38:24.560 --> 38:31.040]  phd stood and then a a pentagon air force psych warfare psychiatrist the head of the
[38:31.040 --> 38:35.520]  entire san antonio operation is sent there and then he visits with her multiple times weekly
[38:35.520 --> 38:39.520]  and there's a big folder with him reportedly talking about doing it and the prosecutors
[38:39.520 --> 38:45.840]  don't want that in the trial and they move to block it when the defense says that that's evidence
[38:45.840 --> 38:52.800]  that they knew and let him do it i mean unbelievable and then you've got him telling the the jail guards
[38:52.800 --> 38:56.720]  the police say well he was never around other other inmates to say this but there's all the
[38:56.720 --> 39:00.560]  articles we had a report on last night where they said that the inmates described him yelling and
[39:00.560 --> 39:05.120]  screaming for days on end right next to him that's on record he was in general population
[39:05.120 --> 39:16.480]  you know in a cell around people so and then and then tim mcvay had jolly in west the known number two
[39:17.680 --> 39:23.040]  under dr ewing cameron who they have history channel shows about who they would get foster
[39:23.040 --> 39:29.040]  children thousands of them and reprogram them with drugs and audio recordings over a year
[39:29.040 --> 39:32.720]  until they didn't even know who they were had a new identity and you could program
[39:32.720 --> 39:37.760]  children and teenagers was who they mainly grabbed they tried it with the soldiers but men just tend
[39:37.760 --> 39:42.880]  to break down under mind control generally unless it's high-tech drugs now they've even got chips
[39:42.880 --> 39:49.600]  the point is all of this is on record and when you're informed people just say oh that's kooky
[39:49.600 --> 39:54.560]  that doesn't exist despite people reporting tear gas being thrown or flashbanks from both sides
[39:54.560 --> 40:00.880]  all the rest of it you know the smoke bombs uh people letting him in on and on and on the
[40:00.880 --> 40:09.360]  gun control bills right at the time i mean this is what they do who shot reagan go look that up
[40:11.840 --> 40:13.040]  the guy that shot regans
[40:15.600 --> 40:20.720]  father was cia was meeting with jeb bush and others the night before i mean it goes on
[40:20.720 --> 40:28.480]  and on that's denver post by the way it goes on and and washington times on and on and on and on
[40:28.480 --> 40:31.920]  and on and he said he was under mind control the guy that shot
[40:35.520 --> 40:38.880]  john lennon oh man just what's on record is incredible
[40:41.120 --> 40:49.680]  and i wish never mind the stop right there let's uh let let me tell you about some of
[40:49.680 --> 40:55.680]  the other headlines we've got here u n set to implicitly recognize palestinian state despite
[40:55.680 --> 41:01.440]  us israel threats that's roiders uh egypt crisis raises fears of second revolution with a new
[41:01.440 --> 41:06.080]  dictator syrian authorities block internet and phone signals in rebel areas activists say
[41:06.080 --> 41:10.400]  they are communicating with contacts in syria by using satellite telephones i wonder who gave
[41:10.400 --> 41:13.680]  you those and again i'm not for the syrian government but give me a break our governments
[41:13.680 --> 41:18.880]  using al-qaeda against them that is incredibly illegitimate of course we've now got the tsa
[41:18.880 --> 41:22.160]  saying they don't have to go to congressional hearing that congress doesn't have oversight
[41:22.160 --> 41:25.360]  over them and we've got obama saying the u n is over our military i mean
[41:27.840 --> 41:32.880]  aspiring dictator moracy falsely claims 90 percent of egypt stands by him incredible
[41:32.880 --> 41:39.120]  info wars dot com story that's just some of what we're going to be uh breaking down today
[41:41.200 --> 41:47.120]  but let's go to your phone calls right now before i go to this new jersey professor
[41:47.120 --> 41:51.520]  saying stalin didn't kill anybody the russian governments declassified all the files
[41:51.520 --> 41:58.080]  that they killed 10 million ukrainians probably conservatively under stalin five million polls
[41:58.080 --> 42:05.280]  just disappeared worked to death or shot gulag archipelago alexander schultz anica nobel prize
[42:05.280 --> 42:14.160]  winner for literature for for nonfiction i mean just stalin's purges on record of the entire
[42:14.160 --> 42:23.280]  military brass at least six times uh just just stalin is the second biggest mass murderer in
[42:23.280 --> 42:35.360]  history it goes mal and then after that it goes stalin linen hitler and then way down the line
[42:35.360 --> 42:41.440]  i mean these are all well known numbers literally hundreds of major university studies declassified
[42:41.440 --> 42:46.080]  admissions and
[42:51.280 --> 42:56.720]  i've had communists on the streets recognize who i am in new york go into the r and c to cover it
[42:56.720 --> 43:04.320]  and things like that come up get my face threaten me and well we got it on video and say they're
[43:04.320 --> 43:12.960]  glad stalin killed people like me and and and i mean that's in um police state what is it uh
[43:15.360 --> 43:22.960]  martial law 911 rise the police state three-hour film and i'm like hey uh you know communism's
[43:22.960 --> 43:29.920]  bad i mean stalin killed conservatively 30 million people during his reign that's conservative
[43:29.920 --> 43:35.920]  good well i mean you think the government should take over and kill people yeah yeah good i think
[43:35.920 --> 43:40.640]  it's good and you're the women going yeah they ought to kill you and of course they're not going
[43:40.640 --> 43:45.280]  to kill anybody if they got in control they'll order the police and military to go to it and the
[43:45.280 --> 43:50.960]  police and military will say no and they'll kill their entire leadership and then the next round
[43:50.960 --> 43:55.440]  of cops will grudgingly do it and then they'll still take your family too by the way this is
[43:55.440 --> 44:00.240]  going to happen if we don't stop these people i don't think you understand i've analyzed the entire
[44:00.240 --> 44:04.080]  attack profile of the globalist in country after country and what they're setting up here
[44:04.080 --> 44:06.960]  and they're going to shut everything off if they think they can get away with it
[44:06.960 --> 44:11.760]  incrementally in a stair step fashion imploding the economy grabbing more power in the name of
[44:11.760 --> 44:17.040]  fixing it more taxes shut the economy down more implode it more gauge that give money to their
[44:17.040 --> 44:23.440]  friends keep everybody in line implode it more until they find a class of government bureaucrats
[44:23.440 --> 44:30.480]  that will do anything and they're going to put you in jail for dog poo in your yard they're going
[44:30.480 --> 44:36.000]  to put you in jail for not properly weatherproofing your house this is the new greening tyranny the
[44:36.000 --> 44:41.360]  new soviet model and they're going to publicly shame you on the news and they're going to work
[44:41.360 --> 44:46.400]  you you have to understand under the civilian inmate labor camp program the model states
[44:46.400 --> 44:51.120]  health emergency powers act under the emergency centers establishment act i hope you're writing
[44:51.120 --> 44:56.560]  all this down under the army manuals we've covered here at nauseam just type in army manual has
[44:56.560 --> 45:01.520]  uh has forced labor army manual has done confiscation army manual says reeducation camp
[45:01.520 --> 45:06.240]  you'll get our articles with links to army dot mill with it that guys just show them some of that
[45:06.240 --> 45:10.720]  right now they're watching on present planet dot tv but radio listeners go search it you know go to
[45:10.720 --> 45:16.080]  it for yourself under the whole architecture of this they're already now as i told you a decade
[45:16.080 --> 45:21.280]  ago they're announcing oh when things collapse you'll have to work at the emergency center you'll
[45:21.280 --> 45:26.880]  have to do some work obviously we're not going to pay for you living in the camp and then those of
[45:26.880 --> 45:31.440]  us that have skills will be if we're if we're trustees improve we're good after a few months
[45:31.440 --> 45:36.400]  of the reeducation camp we'll be told okay go with these armed guards and go fix this government
[45:36.400 --> 45:40.960]  boiler uh okay go with these armed guards go out and work on these streets it'll be like you see the
[45:40.960 --> 45:46.720]  prisoners who are taking other people's jobs by the way people like we'll make the prisoners work
[45:46.720 --> 45:51.840]  well for for nothing 25 cents an hour or less and then you'll go and you'll bust out and then
[45:51.840 --> 45:56.320]  these guys with guns they'll be nice to you too if you don't get too out of the way you know if
[45:56.320 --> 46:00.640]  jail guards don't want your wife then they'll go you know lock you up in the camp at night and
[46:00.640 --> 46:05.200]  there'll be people in the camp who who were patriots who will get scared and become energetic
[46:05.200 --> 46:10.000]  enforcers and they'll be back a month later in a uniform but then they'll make somebody mad and
[46:10.000 --> 46:14.560]  then they'll disappear because see what they'll do is they'll have camps within camps for interrogation
[46:14.560 --> 46:21.200]  then they'll say oh you've been out of line we're sending you now to uh to a high security facility
[46:21.200 --> 46:26.320]  and you'll just be killed the mercenaries are at that facility and this has all been figured out they
[46:26.320 --> 46:32.160]  hired the former head of the kgb premikov in 2002 to 2005 to come here i didn't believe that when i
[46:32.160 --> 46:35.920]  first saw in the news i looked at the congressional funding they hired marcus wolf the head of the
[46:35.920 --> 46:40.560]  stasi to come over for him former head of stasi he had a million dollar contract for what four years
[46:40.560 --> 46:46.560]  he's now dead helping set all the stuff up and that's why it's stasi i mean the the enforcement
[46:46.560 --> 46:50.880]  model is a hardcore communist enforcement system that's why people from communist countries are
[46:50.880 --> 46:55.040]  freaking out and leaving the u.s and running to latin america in places because they can deal with
[46:55.040 --> 46:59.280]  regular old corruption and shakedowns but when they're like seeing actual soviet oppression
[46:59.280 --> 47:06.160]  that you know where daddy and mommy disappeared they're like i'm getting out of here hope you
[47:06.160 --> 47:13.840]  enjoy it folks james in north carolina you want to talk about 2012 go ahead uh yeah actually uh
[47:13.840 --> 47:19.040]  good to talk to you now spend a couple months um and i'd also called in in reference to the
[47:19.040 --> 47:26.240]  information you guys were putting out in regards to the call out okay um you may recall um i called
[47:26.240 --> 47:31.760]  in a little while ago actually gave us some information on uh darpa program called crossing
[47:31.760 --> 47:38.400]  the threshold um we talked about actually the salt barrier being broken by darpa and and uh
[47:38.400 --> 47:43.360]  using white particles to actually be able to do it and manipulate people and and take over
[47:43.360 --> 47:50.080]  you in mind control oh well there oh yeah i mean as dr begat says uh a prestigious scientist uh the
[47:50.080 --> 47:57.360]  chemical stuff is old but that's 1940s 50s soviet technology stolen by the cia and perfected to a
[47:57.360 --> 48:02.720]  higher level not quite perfected but but brought close to it with the brain chips and things it's
[48:02.720 --> 48:08.960]  total i mean 30 years ago they had roaches that remote control 20 years ago they had roborats
[48:08.960 --> 48:12.880]  the remote control yeah they can put brain chips in and have you do whatever you're told
[48:14.080 --> 48:18.160]  well actually even goes a step beyond that now the the ability to have is actually using
[48:18.160 --> 48:23.440]  light particles and light beams um they can actually achieve thought profiling and transfer
[48:23.440 --> 48:30.080]  into any language um no i know that because the brain program works in a flicker rate and then they
[48:30.080 --> 48:34.720]  can now transmit data through the eyes directly the brain that's why they're in government buildings
[48:34.720 --> 48:39.680]  putting in the lights that quote communicate with the computers at a flash rate that can't be perceived
[48:39.680 --> 48:44.160]  consciously and then i went and found the patents that dr begat on it's actually programmers they're
[48:44.160 --> 48:48.880]  actually programming now under federal grants mainly in police departments to test and see
[48:48.880 --> 48:53.600]  if they can put police under mind control yes sir and i actually spoke with you on this previously
[48:53.600 --> 48:58.880]  and uh uh work in the insurance industry and actually have uh had some information sent over
[48:58.880 --> 49:03.600]  from a company that's participating in this uh they gave some information out and instead
[49:03.600 --> 49:07.680]  basically that the we're going to be able to communicate with animals uh they can pull the
[49:07.680 --> 49:12.960]  stuff you know simultaneously well uh you know achieving thought profiling of actual people
[49:12.960 --> 49:18.000]  without them knowing no i know it's actually you're saying that this is uh you why don't you send
[49:18.000 --> 49:23.280]  over anything that isn't proprietary or classified i know you're an insurance so it's not send it on
[49:23.280 --> 49:28.240]  over we're media send it to show tips and info wars dot com and i am aware of all this and i'm aware
[49:28.240 --> 49:34.160]  of its deployment uh all over i mean that's why the elite are so arrogant right now the public
[49:34.160 --> 49:40.000]  is already in a trance some people are resistant or immune to this and that's why we're still able
[49:40.000 --> 49:45.920]  to operate i mean that's why folks it's so far gone i mean that's why celebrity doesn't matter
[49:45.920 --> 49:52.720]  attacks on me don't matter uh none of it once you know reality none of this facade even matters
[49:52.720 --> 49:57.840]  anymore and and they haven't perfected all this stuff they're testing it on us right now and i
[49:57.840 --> 50:01.600]  just want to say to all the minions of this system if you want your free will and consciousness
[50:01.600 --> 50:06.400]  taken don't fight this because they're just going to try to get us in a catatonic state
[50:06.400 --> 50:11.680]  to then release the bio weapons to reduce our numbers over 90 percent anything else sir uh
[50:11.680 --> 50:17.200]  yes right now it's it's on uh basically a one-on-one type of basis the people they used to
[50:17.200 --> 50:21.680]  felt profile can only do it they can't do it on a math scale yet so i mean like you were just saying
[50:21.680 --> 50:25.840]  before gets to the point where they can actually you know systematically put something in place
[50:25.840 --> 50:30.160]  or a computer program you know where it can do it on a math scale i mean this is the time where
[50:30.160 --> 50:35.360]  let me take san Antonio it's a test ground you've heard for three years how the pentagon put ai
[50:35.360 --> 50:41.520]  put ai cameras in to track the calories to even scan an apple when a child eats it and then put it
[50:41.520 --> 50:47.520]  in a file that what's really going on is they put those light bulbs in in that san Antonio school
[50:47.520 --> 50:52.640]  i have that from inside the school the first one they did it and that the computers are actually
[50:52.640 --> 51:00.240]  testing the children under the fluorescent lights it's so it's so far gone folks we're so far gone

[54:14.720 --> 54:22.640]  so much of the focus by the globalist is on flicker rates with lights and now they can interface
[54:22.640 --> 54:27.760]  and transmit data directly to the brain in fact I mean it was in mainstream news what two weeks ago
[54:27.760 --> 54:35.040]  that scientists use light patterns to program brain and I mean so but but they're now announcing
[54:35.040 --> 54:39.680]  what's old the point is just like they you have a cell phone and it listens to you even when it's
[54:39.680 --> 54:44.640]  off and they admit the NSA now does that I told you 16 years ago they now admit it just the last
[54:44.640 --> 54:50.880]  few years they tell you way after they think that you've habitualized its use that you have a total
[54:50.880 --> 54:58.960]  habit and will accept it it's all animal training it's all domestication and everything is how to
[54:58.960 --> 55:06.640]  program you with these lights and it's just insane now they have data over power lines and the smart
[55:06.640 --> 55:14.800]  meters can program through the energy through regular regular fluorescent light bulbs
[55:16.800 --> 55:24.400]  and program your mind puts you into a state and it's all patented it's all in record it works
[55:24.400 --> 55:29.200]  I remember like 14 years ago I had the CEO of a company it's now been put in in Japan and other
[55:29.200 --> 55:33.840]  areas in the US it freaked people out too much the Japanese actually have adopted it
[55:33.840 --> 55:41.120]  but where coke machines soft drink machines beam a audio but you can't hear it in your ear it
[55:41.120 --> 55:46.480]  resonates in your skull directly through telling you you want to drink the drink now they face scan
[55:46.480 --> 55:51.200]  with Facebook in Japan they're also testing this in New York City where it knows you when you walk
[55:51.200 --> 55:57.040]  by beams audio and says don't you want a Pepsi don't you want a coke or don't you want something
[55:57.040 --> 56:01.920]  out of this vending machine John Doe now you saw that minority report what a decade ago
[56:01.920 --> 56:10.720]  because folks it isn't minority report Philip K. Dick was in with some very powerful researchers
[56:10.720 --> 56:16.880]  in San Francisco and I've had a chance to talk to people connected to the Philip K. Dick estate
[56:16.880 --> 56:25.040]  I'll just leave it at that and in fact they may even be at liberty to come on after the show make
[56:25.040 --> 56:28.720]  me I didn't call any of those people I told you to make me call yesterday make me call those people
[56:28.720 --> 56:32.640]  as I got stuck in other meetings because I want to try to get the Philip K. Dick daughters on
[56:33.360 --> 56:37.840]  I'll just so just say it and I want to try to get because obviously I wasn't scanner darkly
[56:37.840 --> 56:41.920]  and consulted on that with Keanu Reeves and others Woody Harrelson and others and the
[56:41.920 --> 56:45.920]  and and and they authorized the rights for that Philip K. Dick to be turned into a movie so that's
[56:45.920 --> 56:50.480]  how I have connection through Tommy Pilota the producer I need to get Tommy on because
[56:50.480 --> 56:56.400]  the Tommy knows a lot too but I don't know what the point is folks he wrote that stuff in the 70s
[56:56.400 --> 57:04.080]  okay we're not in Kansas anymore all this stuff was envisioned a long time ago we're living in a
[57:04.080 --> 57:10.560]  plan the globalists are 30 years at least ahead of us and I just want to communicate with the
[57:10.560 --> 57:16.320]  globalist and say you're not this this this old plan is dynamic it's amazing you've been able to
[57:16.320 --> 57:20.240]  do this but you're you're so cold-blooded you think that's your strength it's your weakness
[57:21.840 --> 57:25.760]  and you're going to end up destroying yourself you can't do this to the species
[57:25.760 --> 57:30.800]  and not have it come back on you and I know a lot of you are turned over to pure evil but some of
[57:30.800 --> 57:37.520]  your children and people who are now middle-aged who aren't pure evil and others because I've talked to
[57:37.520 --> 57:46.320]  you including some European heads of state and you're having second thoughts about this you don't
[57:46.320 --> 57:54.720]  want to do this you don't want to do this but I'm on two paths here trying to convince you
[57:54.720 --> 57:58.800]  this is not a good path and trying to wake up whoever's not in a full trance right now
[58:00.480 --> 58:04.320]  I said I'd go to calls and I got a guest coming up he's on the guests only almost for 30 minutes

[58:32.640 --> 58:37.600]  yes Larry Abraham's son will be speaking to us from the grave Joshua Abraham

[59:09.600 --> 59:14.320]  and produces electricity from the sun it's like having an electrical power plant running quietly

[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:40.960]  thanks for holding hi alex thank you so much um i'm a really big fan of yours so i really
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:46.480]  love your show it's great to speak with you um i just basically want to ask a question um do you
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:54.240]  see any tie-in between um the coming or i should say current um new world order and this projection
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:01:00.880]  of end of the world um December 21st can you yes yes yes it's an it's an archetype that a new age
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:06.320]  is going to begin begin but they mean they're their new false age of tyranny the globalists are
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:13.920]  always counterfeits and so uh basically they're saying that they want at a subconscious level
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:18.720]  you to believe you're dead already and that you have no power so you will just accept
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:24.400]  the new paradigm they give you which is the loss of free will right so anything is basically better
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:31.200]  than i guess suffering the end of the world and dying well it is the end of the world as we know it
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:36.400]  you know to take a line from the it was an r.e.m song and we should be playing that every day in
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:40.800]  the build up how many days till the end of the world uh the media will cut that out of context
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:45.040]  i'm not saying that's going to happen but but it is the end of the family it is the end of our human
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:49.760]  genetics we're being manipulated it is the end of the earth is as designed by the creator it is
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:56.160]  it is the globalist playing god as in the days of noa it's all repeating itself in a horrible way
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:03.680]  and so uh you know it's not that noa was perfect in his generations his genetics were perfect
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:11.360]  and and and again the globalists seek to defile everything they seek to play god and uh they are
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:19.200]  trying to destroy the earth while attaining off-world technology that as best i research this is what
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:24.640]  the highest level alumnus are saying the old world has to die for a new world to be created so they
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:28.800]  want to be able to remake the world hence the underground seed vaults that aren't gmo the rest
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:33.760]  of it while they attain the interface with computers they're willing to destroy the earth
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:39.040]  to gain that life extension technology but that's the that's the spiritual deception they're not
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:46.640]  going to be given that uh and so they believe they must become as gods but the old world must pass
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:52.880]  away and then they're prepared to fight with the computers they're going to use to get rid of us
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:58.720]  the computers will be used as skynet to enforce the takeover of the old dominion of man but
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:03.360]  then the globalists will double cross the computers as well and that's what 2001 space
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:10.240]  odyssey is all about these are the highest secrets of the eliminati anything else well i just i'm
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:14.800]  just amazed that you're inside and i have to say well thank you show it's really opened my eyes to
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:20.800]  like how corrupt people really are and i think it's sad and i think we have to do what you said is
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:27.600]  you know fight for our families fight for our country and i'm i'm right there with you well yes
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.960]  yes ma'am god bless you and thanks for your kind words look i'm just trying to survive and trying
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:35.760]  to have humanity go forward with some some some of our genetics intact basically but
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:40.640]  it's my love letter to humanity i mean i just because i love goodness i mean i'm not not even
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:45.200]  the i mean i've got my dark side too but my my my good side's a lot better and listen they've
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:50.960]  designed the world where corruption is all that succeeds now but that's only for the high level
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:56.240]  controllers the low level folks could still succeed and we could still build a system based on mutual
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:03.920]  respect and honor but the losers as they're called have been programmed believing that only
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:08.720]  corruption will give them power and so they're following that when they're designed like an
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:15.920]  enzyme to basically liquefy the tissue of the society so the people been programmed to be
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:21.920]  corrupt and and again but people that are corrupt it hurts me that they have fallen that they have
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:29.680]  totally failed that that that they're just rolling around in their squalor is extremely painful
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:36.640]  and i do want to uplift humanity i'm a fan of man and again al Pacino and devil's advocate says
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:42.960]  the devil's a fan of man the devil comes to kill steal and destroy and wants to hurt humans because
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:49.360]  the devil isn't a creator these entities angels whatever you want to call them if you read the
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:55.200]  bible and every other ancient culture they can't create so they want to destroy they can only have
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:05:03.760]  man create ugly twisted things for them millions of people are going to get sick this winter from

[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:18.640]  seeing around the coffee table and multiple copies on the bookshelf and i remember before i
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:24.800]  could even read pulling it off the bookshelf and looking at it this is a more recent reprint of
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:30.960]  a little bit larger format it was a little bit smaller paperback in size the runaway bestseller
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:35.920]  over five million in print i think that's an old reprint i think it's well over five million
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:43.520]  and patriots got these bought these at cost by the hundreds of peace people like uh bobby vaughn
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:51.120]  my parents good friends there on san fernando way in dallas texas uh where i was born and grew up
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:57.680]  and he would babysit me sometimes uh because he worked for the telephone company and uh at night
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:02.240]  so then he was up in the afternoon and uh like his morning and sometimes you know he'd keep me
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:07.360]  and i remember rock and roll music blaring off his turntable and even sometimes he'd give me a
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:12.240]  little drink of beer when i was like three you know the kids love beer probably i got one sip of beer
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:16.880]  come on and i remember this book and he was in the john birch society he's now died he died of
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:21.200]  brain cancer great guy though the point is uh we stayed in contact with him until he died the point
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:25.200]  is he would a few years ago he would run around and talk about the new world lord of the federal
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:29.600]  reserve and all this and my dad already knew about it from when he was a teenager because he would go
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:35.040]  around giving anti-communist speeches it was even on the radio in dallas um speaking out against
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:39.440]  this stuff but then stopped fighting it when he got into college it's a side issue the point is i
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:43.760]  remember all the john bircher's coming over my dad wasn't even in it but they would all come over
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:49.680]  and how about the new world order around coffee uh and uh i'm now spending all the time covering
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:53.520]  this the point is i then read this book i don't know i was like 12 when i started becoming a really
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:58.240]  good reader and i read it again when i was about 16 and i've read it three times and it was published
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:10.240]  what 1970 let me open it up in 1972 written in 1971 uh with gary allen and larry abraham uh gary allen
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:15.280]  son went on to found politico which i guess it does cover bill deberg occasionally but it's kind of
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:22.480]  mainline more liberal uh wow but larry abraham his son joshua abraham is the eighth son of larry
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:28.800]  abraham's 11 children he is a former top wakeboarder and former sponsored snow skier he's been
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:34.400]  researching his father's work for the last four years 11 children man talk about wealth that's
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:37.600]  as wealthy as it gets that's more wealth than somebody with a trillion bucks if i don't have
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:43.920]  11 kids i envy that believe me uh but uh none dare call a conspiracy available at info wars
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:49.440]  store.com i should add and the fell that reprinted it just died of cancer so we're hoping to get it
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:53.360]  back in print but we've got most the copies that are left right now at info wars store.com
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:58.240]  i'm being to start a run on these but it's just a fact along with the the republishing of um
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:02.560]  tragedy and hope by curl quickly that the same publisher put out but he joins us here and i've
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:12.720]  got some notes uh to break some news about what his dad talked about um what what he disclosed to him
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:18.320]  days before he died in 2008 on july 7th and why his son got interested in the new world order
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:22.320]  a lot of kids you know don't really get interested in what their parents are till later and um
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:28.720]  so he joins us here and we'll have about 40 after or so then we'll go to your calls
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:33.360]  those that are holding and we'll get you back again uh josh abraham because it's good to hear
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:40.000]  from your father larry abraham from the grave uh but and i commend your father's work because
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  i mean the information they had from congressional sources larry mcdonnell and others
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:49.280]  there's no book that's been currently written that lays out how it all works and this was written
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:55.840]  30 40 years ago i guess i guess 40 years ago i mean i was born in 74 and this book had already
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:01.840]  been out for many years and millions out there so i just can't gush enough about it um you've
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:07.840]  thank you for joining us sir oh thank you for having me alex jones okay tell us about your
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:14.560]  awakening the last four years what your dad told you uh on his deathbed well first of all let me
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:19.280]  say thank you for having me on it's a great pleasure to be on your show i've been listening to you
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:25.440]  for about over a year now and um first of all i want to say thank you second of all i want to
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:32.960]  say thank you to my creator my my creator jesus and um what i liked how you were talking about
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:39.680]  earlier about um what al Pacino said in uh the devil's advocate and um that's one of my favorite
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:46.240]  movies and what when he was talking to kevin at the end of that movie about how he's a fan of man
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:53.760]  and how he's you know he's um he doesn't judge humans for for their judgment calls that they make
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:14:01.680]  because if you think about it who in their right mind could ever possibly deny that the 20th century
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:08.640]  completely belonged to the devil we had two world wars then we had the gulf war you know we had all
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:14.160]  these wars going on and what's really kind of blowing my mind is that when you got all the
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:20.960]  evidence laid out in front of you all this um evidence like sneaking into the movies of what
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:26.240]  out directors are saying and what all the research that i've come across in the past couple years
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:32.800]  you know hollywood is you know they're trying to tell us something the guy who wrote the devil's
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:37.840]  advocate the guy who wrote that movie me and my brother kai we talk about a lot whenever
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:43.760]  we hook up and hang out with each other there was something really being said when al Pacino
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:50.480]  was talking to kevin or um keanu reeves in that movie well it's funny i raised that now you're
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:54.640]  bringing that up tell for people that don't know about your father uh tell us about him a little
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:15:02.560]  bit i think that's important well my father you know he was a great man alex and the fact of
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:08.960]  the matter is my father had a message and that message is there is something going on that is
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:16.320]  not right in the book that he wrote none dare call a conspiracy he provides the evidence gary ellen
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:22.880]  wrote that book and my father did the research for it but a lot of people tend to forget that
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:29.920]  my father's legacy of the books that he wrote he had another one the sequel called call a conspiracy
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:36.880]  after none dare was written and then my personal favorite was this book called the greening the
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:44.160]  greening was a book that he wrote in 1992 when i was just a kid and he was living out in gig harbour
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:52.160]  beach and what this book is about is about how in current day you know none dare call a conspiracy
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:59.360]  gave us the overrun of what's going on and who's involved and how it was all set up now the greening
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:11.840]  explains in today's world in today's events what agenda 21 and what all this um epa all this government
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:18.960]  regulation with permits all all these unnecessary rules that we go through i mean a lot of small
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:24.320]  business owners know what i'm talking about but all these little environmentalist rules and all
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:34.480]  these regulations that this is all derived from paganism this is all about agenda 21 the georgia
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:41.040]  guide stones with the 10 commandments with number one being you've got to reduce the population to
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:46.720]  half a billion to have a perfect balance with man in nature at the higher level they admit that
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:51.840]  they would say this in the un biological diversity assessment 1996 they said human sacrifice and i
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:57.440]  have shots of this uh the you know the the the not the boil down on the un website but i went to the
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:03.120]  ut library and got it you can get it folks where they said we were going to reintroduce ritualized
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:10.240]  war and human sacrifice because gaya needs blood this is official un law i mean these people are
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:15.600]  absolute devil worshipers but they'll say oh no our gods predates your christian devil
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:22.800]  please continue well you're exactly right and what really kind of blows my mind and when i when i
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:28.960]  try to bring this evidence to my friends and my family i i ask him one simple question first of
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:35.520]  all i say you know human beings don't do things without a reason now let me give you a question
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:44.880]  why are the most important most powerful most important powerful richest people on this planet
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:53.680]  worshiping satan why are they doing it because alex it's real and what really shocked me
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:59.680]  when after my father died you know i didn't come across his information i didn't even read his
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:04.480]  books while he was alive and every day i have to live with that alex i have to live with the fact
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:11.680]  that my dad is not here and i need him now more than ever because i didn't i wasn't interested i
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:16.640]  was a young kid you know i was like in my younger 20s you know i was doing my wakeboarding in my
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:21.920]  snow skiing no no the world programs you that mom and pop don't know anything well even if
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:26.720]  people's parents aren't perfect they at least instinctively care about you when the rest of
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:34.080]  the world could care less exactly and what's really crazy is that when i came across the question
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:41.920]  of what's going on i did all my research and then i just realized i mean people say how they found
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:49.680]  jesus or they found god no like i found satan i found that the world's most powerful leaders
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:55.280]  were worshiping satan because you can't have jesus without satan or the other way around or say
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:59.440]  you're not gonna run this world you're not going to be the god of this world you're not going to
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:05.680]  be in power if you don't serve the god of this world exactly and then people tend to forget you
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:11.120]  know all you bible scholars and christians out there you should really really listen up because
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:20.320]  lucifer is the god of air lucifer is the god of music he is the god of this planet but what we
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:28.160]  have to come to grips with is that yeshua and his father god what yeshua is his real name you all
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:35.040]  know him as jesus but yeshua and his father god are the are the actual rulers of the universe satan
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:41.600]  is just the god of this small little planet but we have to come to grips with is that we're not the
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:45.760]  center of the universe there are so i mean we all know there's exactly let's get into what your dad
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:50.720]  told you on his deathbed straight ahead none dare call a conspiracy with gary allen and larry abraham

[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:09.440]  we're in so much trouble going back to josh abraham whose father co-wrote the book and did
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:14.480]  the research with gary allen for none they're called it conspiracy he joins us tell us tell us
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:19.040]  what your dad told you four years ago when he died on his deathbed that got you back on the
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:25.760]  path to researching what's going on and discovering how much your father really knew well um a week
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:33.120]  before he died we were sitting there on the couch watching uh fox news and and um and a story came
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:39.840]  up about contaminated water and keep in mind whenever i watched fox news and my dad he would
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:46.640]  just ramble on and on like oh these communists these global as these this and these that but
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:51.120]  then he turned to me he was like you know some what they're doing in our water is what they're
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:56.240]  going to be doing to our air here very soon and i looked at him and i was like what are you talking
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:05.600]  about he goes you'll see they'll start contaminating our air and then um july 7th the day died um i was
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:12.320]  there at his deathbed with my brother joe and my sister jenny and he told me two things he said
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:20.080]  number one son the globalist socialist storm is coming i'm glad i don't have to live through it but
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:25.280]  you're gonna have to live through it and fight through it so get ready for it and the second
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:31.520]  thing he told me was never deny your thirst for knowledge when it hits you the thirst for knowledge
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:38.080]  is going to hit you boy and when it does don't deny it don't ignore it just go with it and let it
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:43.280]  flow and after that i was just sitting there i was like dad i've only read a couple science fiction
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:47.600]  novels you know i've only read the you know sports illustrated i don't know what you're talking about
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:54.560]  but you know i wish you you know i miss my father so much and i need him here more than ever to talk
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:59.760]  to me about what's really going on but after reading his books and doing my personal research
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:05.120]  which when he was talking about the stuff being put in the air like contaminating our air like
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:11.840]  they're contaminating our water these chemtrails that i see in the sky these these chemtrails
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:16.240]  that i see everywhere i mean people gotta know it's being added to the jet fuel even the pilots
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:20.160]  don't know and they have some that is special modification that are specially rigged but
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:25.840]  we have the patents shifting gears your father because i did the research i was connected
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:32.720]  with larry mcdonnell congressman and others yeah it was the first at so many levels to really
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:37.840]  crystallize how they control the left and the right how they would bring in this system how
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:43.360]  they would use the green movement how the ultra rich funded the communist how did your dad get this
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:48.160]  much knowledge because we could sit here in 2012 and go oh yeah we all know this how did he know
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:56.400]  it 1970 you know alex um my dad was definitely the smartest man that i've ever met in my life and
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:03.600]  i'm sure my my huge family by uh seven brothers and three sisters can back me up on that but
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:10.000]  as far as where he got the knowledge i mean he was a good friend of ron paul he was a part of the
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:15.840]  i'm pretty sure he was involved with the reagan administration i mean he just had a lot of friends
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:20.160]  no no no i know in fact that's what i read your dad and gary allen were helping wake ronald reagan
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:25.040]  up about the new world order and that he and that's why he was getting you know the john
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:30.960]  burts information reagan was really coming along and then of course we all know the vice president
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:37.360]  they made him take everything that happened then yeah when uh bush yeah when he took bush as the
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:42.800]  vice president even my brother kai said and he was just like why is he taking this guy i mean we
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:49.680]  got to remember that bush was the director of the council of foreign relations you know there is a real
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:57.280]  agenda going on here and what people have to wake up to is that this there's a presidential bloodline
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:02.320]  i mean if people don't know barack obama he's an 11th cousin of george bush jr and george
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:07.520]  bush jr is a third cousin of algor and john carrey who's a bloodline of george but it's worse than
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:11.600]  that i mean it's like a breed of dog where all french bulldogs related or all governments are
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:17.280]  related or all you know pit bulls i mean they've done the maps on ancestry dot com
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:23.040]  obama is related to shaney and then he's they're all related it's like they're all and i don't
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:27.840]  mean like i'm talking third fourth cousins and stuff you know it's not like distantly related
[01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:34.240]  oh no it's not distantly related at all this is a very tight bloodline that stretches all the way
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:39.920]  back to the british monarchy and the british monarchy stretches back to the arab kings of
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:46.320]  civill which are descendants of muhammad people have to realize that this bloodline this ruling
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:53.600]  bloodline has been going on stay there stay there we're on the march the empires on the run

[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:29.600]  i want our guests to repeat what his father said to him before he died
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:37.840]  the exact words are powerful the global socialist superstorm is coming what was the
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:43.920]  exact quote that your father co-author of none dare call a conspiracy i told you josh abraham
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:52.560]  um what he told me on his deathbed um was the globalist socialist storm is coming
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:58.960]  and we all need to get ready for it that this world that we live in this so called democracy
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:04.240]  and gerald salante he's my favorite guest he said it better himself this is a republican
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:09.680]  and democratic criminal syndicate of the united states government that's exactly what we're
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:16.240]  tripping luciferians as well i mean they're just absolutely evil yeah and it's he warned me you
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:22.320]  know the globalist socialist storm is coming and then he told me never deny your thirst for
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:27.920]  knowledge once it hits you i mean this is my father telling me that i'm gonna you know do
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:33.200]  something like i didn't i had no thirst for knowledge alex i had no want to read books and
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:39.680]  let me tell you in the past two years i've read the entire king james bible all three of my dad's
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:48.320]  books michael taserion i've read david ike i've read the book of ostara i've read um what was that
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:51.760]  the point is you're doing a lot of research and opening your mind up so you can make decisions
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:57.200]  for yourself and there's no doubt that the limited info we're given by the corporate control media
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:03.440]  is not even a fraction of the real information in the universe now we only got a few minutes left
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:08.320]  before i got a call so probably have you back up in the future uh i hope that you know the
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:15.520]  fellow that republished your dad's book died of cancer uh just two weeks ago uh i hope the book
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:20.240]  continues to be in print but we've got some that are still available at info or store.com
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:24.320]  anything else you'd like to add because talking about none dare call it conspiracy guys give me
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:29.840]  a document cam shot in here for for tv viewers so they can see this these graphs in here that are so
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:36.560]  simple but beautifully explain what people will never be taught in mainline political science
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:41.760]  classes now when you get up to phd level they'll actually teach you this but only because you've
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:45.680]  got to work for the system and they'll explain to you why it's a good thing but assuming in here
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:52.800]  it explains democratic socialism the cover and it goes through how it controls labor finance
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:58.240]  business legislatures judiciary state county city charity politics education in a unified corporate
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:03.920]  global system and so it's an off the shelf program they download into your government and that they
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:08.720]  buy off the government through fiat fractal reserve banking your dad breaks all that down here we are
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:13.600]  40 years later it's all come true versus constitutional republic and how it operates
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:20.800]  you've got the maps in here on the pressure from above pressure from below it breaks down
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:27.760]  carol quigley jp morgan how they operated how the fellow reserve puts you into debt to then totally
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:33.920]  implodes you down the road how they devalue the dollar woodrow wilson how the british intelligence
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:40.320]  operation is working on this the ross child's it's got these got photos of them in here it's
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:45.840]  got cruise chef being funded by our own government with nelson rockefeller it's got the pressure
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:51.760]  from above pressure from below it's got how kissinger was going to get us off the gold standard
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:57.520]  i mean and it all came true it's all in here trying to find the how the cfr manipulates the
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:03.520]  republican democratic parties was very simple but but but the true mark of genius is something
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:08.960]  simple that simply explains something with great depth and accuracy that's got how the
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:15.360]  wolbergs funding uh you know the nazis uh i'm trying to find the pressure from above and they fund
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:20.880]  the poor people uh to then get rid of the middle class for the megabankers anything else you'd
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:25.200]  like to add about this book and i mean what it was like to read it after your dad was dead
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:35.520]  well it was very um eye-opening and to say the least it kind of woke me up to like imagine this
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:41.680]  alex like imagine you and me knowing this information okay you know you talk about i
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:45.600]  listened to your show a lot and you talk about the matrix you got to think of it like this
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:52.800]  if you were in the matrix if the matrix was actually real and you were jacked in and you know
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:57.760]  you were like neo or tranny get in and out of the matrix but what what if you were stuck in there
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:02.480]  and you couldn't jack out and you couldn't come back out of the matrix into the real world what
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:08.320]  if you were stuck in the matrix what would you do and that's the kind of mindframe that i have been
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:14.320]  stuck in ever since i've come across this knowledge and read my father's books he nailed it to a tea
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:20.960]  and what's really compelling is that he he even gives the list of names and what organizations
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:27.520]  they work for and when you read up all this knowledge you gotta sit you ask yourself the question
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:35.360]  what can i do about this and me being my father's son you know i'm the only one of my brothers who
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:41.360]  don't have a family and kids i'm i just turned 30 years old i'm the last one left who really has
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:47.360]  like a clean slate who can really do anything without putting my so your dad basically told
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:53.200]  you you were going to get the anointing and that's what it is to continue on his mission he could see
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:59.520]  that in you that's just amazing well i don't know if he didn't say anointing but you know he knew
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:04.400]  you know that it but that's what it is i mean to anoint somebody if you choose the technical
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:09.840]  term is i'm saying this is your mission i'm saying you're going to fulfill this and my mission is to
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:14.560]  reach people who are going to be the leaders that will defeat the new world order i've always known
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:19.840]  in my heart and my gut that from the time i started that i never intended to try to be this
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:24.960]  large force out there i was there to set brush fires in the minds of other men and women and
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:29.840]  of course that's what we do today i mean even most my detractors will say you woke me up but
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:34.080]  now i'm going to come after you but that's because they were in him none of us are perfect but a really
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:38.640]  imperfect uh deformed vessel but but you know some of the some of the seeds are going to fall on the
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:42.560]  rocks some are going to be eaten by the birds others are going to hit the right soil and that's
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:48.480]  what's happening please continue well you're absolutely right you know and obviously you and
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:54.080]  me we got friends and family we try to wake you know i'm trying to wake my own family up to this
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:40:00.960]  whole mess called a conspiracy and they don't believe it you know i try i try to convince my
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:07.440]  mom like mom okay so your dad is a famous paleo constitutionalist friends with ron paul congressman
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:14.240]  larry mcdonnell who they killed uh gary alan icon i'm by newbie new bob Chapman all these people
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:21.440]  and they don't even respect an icon in their family well what's it's they you know me my
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:26.800]  brother kai and my brother joe are pretty much the only ones out of the 11 children that have
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:33.360]  read my father's books unbelievable unbelievable unbelievable and what's really strikes me as crazy
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:40.880]  is that you know we here we are with all the evidence we got them alex in your infiltration
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:47.280]  video of the build of a bohemian grove that is like one of my favorite i just love sitting down
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:54.000]  and watching that the cremation of care is so interesting to watch because what you gotta come
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:01.280]  to grips with is that that is a 2000 year old babelonian satanic ritual of human sacrifice
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:06.960]  they're recreating it it's it's it's unbelievable in closing anything else you'd like to add for
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:13.280]  people about your father about the book none dare call a conspiracy about gary alan yeah in closing
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:19.040]  um i'd like to say we gotta keep talking alex you and me we gotta this isn't gonna be the last
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:23.920]  time i hope i come on your show because there's a lot of research that i've been doing and a lot
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:30.640]  people tend to forget that my father wrote another great book that is my personal favorite called the
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:39.040]  greening and the greening is the total rap sheet of what the globalists are doing today right now
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:44.400]  in front of our faces well listen is that book in print oh it's in print it was published in the
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:51.440]  early 90s i got a copy of it right here in my hand the greening well we're gonna have to carry that
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:55.120]  in the bookstore absolutely we'll get you on the nightly news soon after about a chance to read
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:59.680]  the greening or one of my reporters has and we'll we'll do a review of that great having you on my
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:04.560]  friend and and and we salute your work we salute your father and there's nothing more honorable
[01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:10.160]  than carrying on the work of your father especially when your father was doing such seminal work
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:15.440]  if i have to the touchstone of so much of the liberty movement we've got today
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:19.920]  that is our greatest hope is the work of your father and gary alan god bless you
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:25.360]  yeah and uh thank you for having me on alex and i really hope this isn't the last time i come on
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:32.640]  and i want to ask you is that i'm coming i'm thinking about ryan my own book and i think it
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:38.880]  would be a very powerful message sure if you and me came together yeah the problem is to listen
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:43.840]  i'm not bragging i've been offered by big new york publishing houses you know all these big book
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:48.640]  deals and stuff and my problem is is that i would make a bunch of money and books are great too
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:54.240]  but it doesn't reach as many people i can do a special report that reaches a million people
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:59.840]  boom on youtube outside of the radio audience that's woken up and then a book you know that would
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:06.400]  make me 20 million dollars would only reach you know 300 400 000 500 000 people and i understand
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:10.080]  but but listen just write your book don't wait for me to work with you on it i appreciate you
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:14.080]  joining us my friend we're going to move on to thank you we're going to move on to some calls now
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:21.120]  um yeah i just uh you know i had a bad experience with uh ghost writers uh with two different ones
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:25.040]  with a publisher and because i would say stuff and it would turn into something completely
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:30.400]  different and then i'm so busy trying to complete the nightly nose trying to finish that mission
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:36.080]  trying to finish all the things and i really i probably will write some books because it's
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:40.960]  good to have something in writing it's it's respected and actually it would make a bunch of
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:47.360]  money which i could then use to fund things so now i am leaning more towards a book uh but
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:54.080]  it's just i'm not going to put some crud out you know that's why i haven't made a film in
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:58.960]  two years i mean it's more of a presentation documentary with jules calzen strategic relocation
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:02.320]  it's more of a i'm in it he's in it it's got a lot of great graphics and information it's very
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:10.080]  important but you know it's not a film film i made uh because i you know i think i've gone
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:15.760]  on the right course too films make money uh and they are seen as prestigious and they reach a lot
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:21.920]  of people uh but just churning out reports is is is getting is getting more led down range on the
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:28.000]  globalist so but then i got to do a money bomb uh where i can make a film and make you know you
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:33.920]  know 500 600 to 700 000 a million dollars you know it's a big film um if i did a film right because
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:38.320]  i could make something like denesha susan made i could get it in theaters i could probably hit
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:42.000]  the zeitgeist right and get media behind it and make you know 15 million dollars and that would
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:47.840]  fund us for like three years so i'm trying to work smarter i just so caught in radio every day
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:53.440]  preparation for it training crew dealing with stuff signing checks carrying out trash throwing
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:58.720]  people's you know you spent coffee in the trash i'm not bashing folks but running around you know
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:03.200]  you know trying to get people up and going because i know that's the right plan to go with
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:08.800]  uh and uh that i there's a lot of things i want to do and um
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:15.120]  um well i tell you right now if somebody like larry abraham was alive i'd write a book with him
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:19.040]  and i think that's the answer i think i need to go out and find an established writer
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:25.040]  and then have them go out and and and then and then you know write books with me uh because i
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:29.600]  need to be able to just record have the meetings have the areas have the writer put it together
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:35.040]  add their research and then put it out because let me tell you there's just not that many people
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:38.640]  that have this knowledge and i don't understand why you don't have it i mean i guess you've got
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:44.960]  to study this stuff for 17 years but it's so self-evident it's so you got to read tragedy and hope
[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:48.880]  you got to read nunder call conspiracy you've got to read un documents you've got to just
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:55.120]  you know learn and watch these people and then you figure out man they're a bunch of crazy control
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:46:00.160]  freaks that think lucifer controls them and they want to kill everybody and then you you know and
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:04.560]  a cop pulls you over and goes mind if i search your car and you can't even get mad at the cop this
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:10.240]  is a victim full of vaccines full of fluoride full of gmo you know they're gonna die young their
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:13.760]  wife's gonna die young their kids are gonna die young we're being murdered and you can't even get
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:18.880]  mad at them they're just a victim and then some idiot tsa person chosen because they're a low-grade
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:24.320]  moron who likes to exercise mindless power all day you can't even get mad at them but i i realize
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:28.800]  you've got to get mad at them and put them down and say you're pathetic you're enjoying a power
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:34.320]  trip shame on you stop being a drama queen stop acting like it's bad that i'm asking you questions
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:41.680]  knock it off we've got to rebuke others we've got to rebuke ourselves we've got to get better
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:48.720]  or it's all going to get bad and listen the socialist control freak superstorm is about
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:52.560]  to hit everything you've seen is just the beginning i'm like when the trees are blowing you think oh
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:56.640]  look at that storm coming and it finally hits and the windows are blowing out and the tornado
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:47:04.640]  hits sounds like a freight train coming by i've been in a tornado a bearless survived it not fun and
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:09.440]  with my father and in a car we're driving along it's raining we slow down all of a sudden we're on
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:14.640]  about 40 blows the car off to an embankment 40 foot embankment go through fences slide run into two
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:20.400]  oak trees police state police said it would have killed us so we'd have hit sideways smash these
[01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:30.800]  tahoe all the way in to the back row of seats forward broke my dad and mine seats that they broke
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:35.680]  in the shock and then fell backwards my dad got a concussion throwing up everywhere i got a concussion
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:39.440]  but didn't throw up because my guess my brain's already had so many concussions it was like
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:44.000]  visiting an old friend and the state police got there and said yeah we slowed down and just blow
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:49.680]  the road he goes yeah the tornado just came through here through stone wall the barn's blown over
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:55.200]  right over there you see that you got hit by a tornado and and that's what hit us you see those
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:48:00.800]  trees torn down that's a tornado was fire ants all over us it was not fun but i don't know why
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:05.680]  i'm telling that story again i guess you how did i get off into tornadoes the point is that
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:13.440]  this isn't a game ladies and gentlemen and these people want to rape your children and line you up
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:18.000]  in a pit and blow your head off after working you have to death okay that's what they do that's what
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:24.160]  they create grandma bakes pies and makes you a big chicken fried steak new world order puts poison in
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:28.800]  your water and kills you at the hospital i mean i'm sorry it's dark i'm sorry it's horrible i'm
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:33.840]  sorry it's ugly but if we would admit what the soviets and nazis and polpot and all these scum
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:38.480]  did we don't have to relive it but if we don't we're gonna relive it let's talk to mike in texas
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:42.720]  he wants to talk about 2012 we're talking about this pretty much every day in the countdown towards
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:48.880]  the end of the world they say 21 days i don't buy into it 21 days five hours 11 minutes 13 seconds
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:53.200]  i guess the website that set this up is gone with their time zone because the world will end
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:57.760]  in their time zone on that day that's another question uh which time zone is will it end in
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:05.600]  maybe greenish mean time uh go ahead uh mike oh he just dropped off as i went to him i love that
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:12.480]  uh wilson in florida 2012 in the constitution go ahead hey good afternoon alex there's always a
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:18.240]  pleasure to speak to you i don't i just wanted to speak in regards to really quickly it's 2012
[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:23.600]  i just think that for sure if there's gonna be anything it's gonna be coming from the government
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:30.480]  i don't think anything on this earth is going to be happening naturally like that especially what
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:34.400]  what the way things are i agree but i mean they could do an amp or something i'm not saying
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:38.640]  it's gonna happen but i don't say exactly i agree with you we'll probably see some hell about
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:44.800]  type activity too go ahead and i'm i'm definitely glad you know the last shows i've been listening
[01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:50.640]  to for the last few weeks you've been just beating the drums speaking about how the answer is in the
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:56.080]  tools that our founders gave us you know i don't like getting obsessed with characters or people
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:00.640]  i'm not a fan of anybody i'm a fan of the tools that we have and i'm glad that you just keep
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:05.200]  emphasizing it and i think that's just where the key lies you know we have the tools and we just
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:11.520]  have to have the organization and then we all use the tools i agree with you because of the
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:16.240]  children that i hear in the background i mean we cannot turn our children over to the beast
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:20.880]  and what matters is their hearts and their minds and their souls people need to understand folks
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:26.720]  you do not want to be programmed by this that's the most valuable thing in life is being conscious
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:30.880]  and living in reality and it doesn't mean any of us are perfect we all see through rose colored
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:36.160]  glasses but we have just got to ask god to open up our hearts and i'm not talking about the fake
[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:40.960]  god in these churches folks if you ask the creator of the universe into your heart and to give you
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:46.880]  guidance you'll find it and and it's now time to hit your knees folks even if you don't believe in
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:51.120]  the spiritual world well then you better get in the room and turn the lights down to just sit out
[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:55.440]  and meditate and think about where the world's going because let me tell you you've got to be

[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:34.400]  magazine and i would say overall for go back to your calls and our next guest i am very excited
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:42.000]  about it and it has overperformed in the quality in the sales and the subscriptions what i even
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:48.400]  expected but because we're always adding stuff right up to the date of publishing it about four
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:53.600]  or five days before it comes out and we have it printed there are typos in it sometimes and we're
[01:54:53.600 --> 01:55:01.200]  really working on that it caused kind of a customer service nightmare when we had two octobers yes
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:09.920]  because you know we had an october come out at the start of october and then because we were
[01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:13.920]  about to print it right at the end of october there was an oversight that it said october on
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:19.200]  the front so there were two octobers an early and a late it's just it's kind of cool you know
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:23.840]  because it's a real magazine with our articles and research but a little oversight i've noticed
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:28.080]  though in mainstream stuff you see more and more typos and things because people are using spell
[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:33.680]  checkers and they expect that if a spell checker says it's fine it's fine so then you'll have just
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:39.200]  the wrong words in there and things but uh there's there's not as many typos in the new issue info
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:45.360]  wars magazine this man wants your guns and it even has the right month on the cover december 2012
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:51.360]  and everybody that signs up for a subscription right now you'll get a couple back issues all
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:57.040]  supplies last added into the the first one of the next next 11 that come out and this is undoubtedly
[01:55:57.040 --> 01:56:01.840]  the best one we have produced they just get better and better it's got obama on the front
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:05.840]  standing on the american flag or sitting on it and says this man wants your guns and it's all
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:12.320]  about his agenda for the next four years the globalist agenda and it really wakes people up
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:22.000]  up and i am just so proud of this new publication and it exposes everything obama wants your guns
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:27.040]  and the rest of your freedom second amendment in the crosshairs with all their quotes all the proof
[01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:33.840]  it's got uh just all the facttoids it's got information on how they're going to shut down
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:38.400]  the power plants the latest proof uh and and probably my favorite article in here other
[01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:45.520]  than the ron paul's entire farewell speech printed on four pages uh poster size uh is there's a big
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:52.000]  article called your luggage now departing danger travel advisory beware tsa crime zones and and
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:56.400]  this gets into all the robberies they're doing around the country and a map of it that we have
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:01.520]  right here on uh right here on this page breaking down the most dangerous areas and the taser
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:07.600]  bracelets they want you to wear and everything else it really is a phenomenal publication you

[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:24.240]  monitoring them no i mean there's a lot of stuff people claim that i can't prove uh but i mean i know
[02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:29.360]  that the government is into psychic stuff and you know has the psychic soldier programs and all
[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:34.320]  that that's been declassified and the and the system does believe in it uh you know i know
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:37.600]  everybody's got a little bit of six cents and i know there are there are things that are
[02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:42.880]  un you know that are not understood i know i've had many experiences of dreams that come a hundred
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:48.240]  percent true and other things so i know there's stuff going on out there uh and i know the system
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:52.400]  wants to suppress that for the general public the problem is is there's so much quackery and
[02:01:52.400 --> 02:02:00.400]  bologna involved in it as well oh yeah of course well actually um i got uh these books um one of
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:05.520]  them is called the ancient secret of the flower of life by Drinvalo Melchizedek it has to do with
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:10.080]  you know sacred geometry the flower of life it teaches you how to do the merkeba meditation
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:15.200]  and i actually did it myself and well it's one against their you know you're supposed to actually
[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:20.640]  take the course because it can be dangerous but i did do it myself it took a long time and i was
[02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:28.480]  able to do the meditation properly and uh took place in in queens um at the alipon environmental
[02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:37.440]  center two gigantic um super high tech uh helicopters uh flew right past me after i had uh
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:41.440]  activated but they're constantly flying around it's all part of the this tablet from what you
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:46.080]  mean this is helicopters swarming everywhere where i live at least black helicopters green ones
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:52.080]  drones everybody i know seeing drones i've seen them twice and i saw a predator excuse me a global

[02:02:55.760 --> 02:03:00.480]  going over and i mean it was like going up almost stall speed like a hundred miles an hour it looked
[02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:04.880]  like or less and i mean it was a global hawk or something just like it and i saw that little drone
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:09.440]  that i got video uh that the highway department had i mean i showed i got video i pulled over that

[02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:34.480]  hey alex i was going a long time listening first time caller and i just want to say all
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:39.120]  this 2012 stuff we know the world's not gonna end but i think it will be a perfect opportunity for
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:44.080]  the government to take advantage of it all right so the propaganda that i've done a lot look and
[02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:47.920]  you know it's to come and get the gun to get tsa on the street now i just want to know what you
[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:52.640]  thought about all that and what your opinion on it well yeah i mean they the government's always
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:56.880]  want a gun force that doesn't even have to go to a law enforcement or police college and that's what
[02:03:56.880 --> 02:04:01.200]  tsa is they're setting the precedent where they can give somebody a two week course and have them
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:06.640]  come take your guns i mean that's the new you know minimum wage gun force but i don't who knows
[02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:10.800]  i'm sure there'll be some suicides i'm sure there'll be some craziness just because of the
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:15.680]  incredible media hype i mean a lot of people think the world's gonna end in 21 days or 22 days
[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:21.920]  or whatever it is and it's just asinine me that's the main clue right there just have a media
[02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:28.800]  props to up and talks about it and um noticing about the tsa just today i've seen three tsa big

[02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:36.080]  may come on tomorrow or he may come on next week just for joe rogan fans out there when i said he'd
[02:08:36.080 --> 02:08:41.760]  be on today uh or i may just interview him with a camera when i go out to dinner with him uh saturday
[02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:47.520]  night after his show um or before it we'll see what happens with that so that's just a program
[02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:52.480]  note that i just remembered uh because i was uh saying he'd probably be on thursday that is a busy
[02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:59.840]  guy with all the ufc tv shows uh now doing a daily radio show a lot of the time and uh the movies he's

[02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:11.360]  fellow so we'll uh work on getting that done it's not hard to go out to dinner with joe but it's
[02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:14.320]  it's getting hard to get him on the radio but i know how that is because i do so many radio
[02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:19.280]  interviews that i say no to most of them now because it just becomes a point where you just can't do
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:27.840]  them all but uh we're going to work on that now folks uh the weekly standard is asking the question
[02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:32.240]  we can punch this up on screen for tv viewers radio listeners can just go to drudgereport.com
[02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:40.080]  and see it we also have it up at prismplanet.com senator blast secret fiscal cliff negotiations
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:45.680]  and uh jeff sessions senator sessions is the one that exposed the total amnesty plan with bush
[02:09:45.680 --> 02:09:51.280]  that got shot down and now he's saying it's secret again with the congressional leadership
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:57.280]  and uh that's why romney's there today right now having lunch uh is to you know get the
[02:09:57.280 --> 02:10:01.600]  republicans to go along with tax increases because the foreign banks just like in europe
[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:07.440]  they want that tax money and so they'll say oh we're going to cut to cut the essential services
[02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:12.720]  and welfare you know off and federal money for police they always do this if you don't give us
[02:10:12.720 --> 02:10:17.200]  you know the new tax increase on the rich and meanwhile google all these big companies are
[02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:23.440]  offshore and basically pay almost no tax that's in the news the ultra rich are the ones lobbying
[02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:28.240]  for higher taxes and the day the left figures this out is the day we save this country but the
[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:32.720]  right wing's the same they love all their corporate welfare they'll never recognize that they're
[02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:37.360]  always saying low-level socialists want higher taxes well yeah because they're ignorant uh so
[02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:45.040]  this is a big deal and they want a vat and a carbon which goes directly into the big
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:48.240]  multinationals as a derivative and now the un's saying they're going to have diplomatic
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:52.320]  community for people trading carbon taxes because a third of it's going to be given to the un
[02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:57.120]  now they're going to give the banks diplomatic community i mean these banks are the world
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:01.440]  government remember our article we wrote a few months ago banks bragged they've conquered the
[02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:08.000]  us in europe it's dozens of links to video of them saying it federal reserve chairman you name it go
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:13.440]  watch it go look at it this is the key to understanding what we're facing and here's my
[02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:17.200]  problem you know they say we want a global government because there's global problems and
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:23.280]  you know all this environmental stuff well all they care about the carbon carbon dioxide
[02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:28.000]  that plants respirate from the lifecycle they don't care about genetic engineering they don't
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:33.440]  care about toxic waste dumping or overfishing or cutting down old growth forest or cross species
[02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:38.640]  all these things that we know are dangerous and they don't care about the 400 plus nuclear reactors
[02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:44.080]  our own energy department estimates 92 percent are leaking you can pull those numbers up just type in
[02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:48.640]  90 plus percent of reactors leaking now when the alarms go off they just decommission the alarms
[02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:54.960]  last year with fukushima the fda the epa first and then fda agreed the epa said we're going to
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:12:00.080]  raise the level of different isotopes hundreds of times thousands of times for some isotopes as it
[02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:07.600]  came over okay so things have really changed they have the troops using du and you've got reactors
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:14.720]  leaking all over 30 40 years old rotting they're not going to the newer cleaner systems now i see
[02:12:14.720 --> 02:12:20.640]  all these leading environmentalists like george mombiott endorsing nuclear power and i'm sorry
[02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:25.040]  folks you know i'm what you call a libertarian constitutionalist back when i was more ignorant 15
[02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:30.640]  years ago i was all about nuclear power but now they're rotting falling apart and the corporations
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:37.760]  don't care they're crazy and within a few weeks of power going out around the country the diesel
[02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:42.560]  will run out we've got an experimental reactor right here in austin shot them being a big power
[02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:48.400]  reactor so i live in the fallout zone of two of these and i don't like it and now they want to build
[02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:55.040]  more of them and run them shoddily and so joining us as a leading expert on this nuclear roulette we
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:13:03.680]  sell the book at infowarstore.com uh forward by jerry mander and Ernst uh collenbach and i have
[02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:07.280]  finally read the book i wanted to get this guy on months ago it came highly recommended by
[02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:12.400]  some of the physicists and people we've had on dr busby and others uh nuclear roulette the truth
[02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:18.480]  about the most dangerous energy source on earth uh gar smith is editor emeritus of earth island
[02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:24.080]  journal a project censored award winner i'm a winner of that as well an investigative journalist
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:30.000]  and co-founder of the environmentalist against war he has covered revolutions in central america
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:35.280]  and has engaged in environmental campaigns on three continents he lives a low impact
[02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:40.480]  solar assisted lifestyle in berkeley california people say well why do you have a guy on an
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:44.240]  environmentalist when you're talking about the green movement and behind the green mask being
[02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:50.000]  the takeover because they attach all this real reasonable stuff to something run by goldman
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:55.920]  sacks and jp morgan that is a tax-based system and so if we just fight the environmental movement
[02:13:55.920 --> 02:14:01.200]  number one it makes us look stupid and it's not sophisticated there's a real environmental movement
[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:05.520]  and there's a clone of it but but a counterfeit but but we're not going to get into that so much
[02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:09.040]  i just wanted to throw that out uh that i don't even have to agree with everything somebody stands
[02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:15.360]  for i don't even know what the guy stands for in total to understand that nuclear power is a ticking
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:19.920]  time bomb that just keeps going off and now when they have leaks all the time in Nebraska or up in
[02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:25.520]  canada it's not it's a footnote now and radiation levels are more than double what they were 60 years
[02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:31.600]  ago in the northern hemisphere now there it is ap radioactive leaks found at 75 percent of u.s
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:37.440]  nuclear power sites the department of energy estimates 92 worldwide but again then that's a
[02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:42.240]  whitewash as well that's associated press okay enough of me gar good to get you on tell us about
[02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:46.720]  your environmental philosophy because we all live on this island earth i agree with you spaceship
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:54.160]  earth and and and where you see this going with the reactors that are just falling apart well
[02:14:54.160 --> 02:15:00.000]  thank you for the invite alex it's um not a good future that we're facing there's a lot of talk about
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:06.720]  the fiscal cliff but uh anybody who's been living on planet earth recently realizes that there's
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:12.640]  something else going on it we're facing a geophysical cliff the uh the weather is changing
[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:20.000]  and we've got reactors that were built for a different planet uh the the reactors that
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:25.200]  are operating today in their old age and their innocence uh they should have been retired at
[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:30.960]  the end of their lifestyles their their life uh their life design times but out of a convenience
[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:35.840]  to the industry which has received convenience after convenience gift after gift bailout after
[02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:40.800]  bailout these things have been re-licensed and allowed to be operated which means that they
[02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:47.600]  can operate hotter and harder to generate more power for an industry that's not as efficient or
[02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:56.560]  as profitable as it used to be and these reactors even the nrc now admits are more susceptible
[02:15:56.560 --> 02:16:02.800]  to earthquake risks than was realized the medium risk is triple the disaster flood risk i mean
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:07.760]  they're having to off gas all the time when there's a moderate flood that's right these things are
[02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:17.200]  not uh they are not leak proof they are admittedly designed to uh to leak tritium xenon uh there are
[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:24.000]  permissible amounts of uh uh radiation that can flow under our waterways and it's permissible
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:28.400]  because it can't be controlled so why not make it permissible it's the same thing the uh the
[02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:33.680]  japanese and the american governments did after fukushima when the radiation went up in the tokyo
[02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:39.680]  schoolyards the uh response from the government was well we'll raise the level for exposure for
[02:16:39.680 --> 02:16:45.280]  children 20 fold same thing happened in the united way the magic wand what is generating in its heart
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:50.000]  don't get into the technicals because you're the expert on this why are they so reckless where do
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:55.040]  these nuclear energy CEOs think their kids are going to live and their grandkids if this continues
[02:16:55.040 --> 02:17:02.400]  well you know i i had a grim insight into the mindset of some of the uh officials that that
[02:17:02.400 --> 02:17:07.760]  have run this program i had a friend whose father worked for the atomic energy commission this is
[02:17:07.760 --> 02:17:12.400]  some time ago this is one of the early guys and i actually had a chance to ask him this question
[02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:19.760]  when i was a student uc berkeley i asked about the the the danger of nuclear power and the problem
[02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:25.680]  of disposing of the nuclear wastes and what he told me was and he introduced his comment with kind
[02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:32.560]  of a uh a laugh and a smirk he said what makes you think human beings are going to be here on
[02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:41.760]  this planet in 200 years unbelievable unbelievable and and you know that's the response i've gotten
[02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:46.480]  that's the response so many other scientists have interviewed whether it's gmo you name it they just
[02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:50.720]  say there's too many people but it's not even saying too many people from their research
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:57.200]  to try to make the earth you know you know more uh sustainable even if you believe that argument
[02:17:57.200 --> 02:18:04.160]  it's just a nihilistic let the devil have an attitude yeah something i concluded after looking
[02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:10.640]  at the response to chernobyl and three mile island and fukushima and more than 50 other
[02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:14.880]  significant reactor accidents we've had around the world in the last 50 years
[02:18:14.880 --> 02:18:24.000]  is that there is a common thread and i've described it as hubris denial and deception
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:30.880]  this is the response to nuclear risk you begin with denial our technology will never fail
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:36.880]  even though you know it leaks well there's a saying within the nuclear engineering community
[02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:42.160]  and it's it's very brief but very telling among themselves they agree they they have this statement
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:48.240]  that nuclear energy can be safe nuclear energy can be clean just not at the same time
[02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:54.720]  that's the hubris now when the hubris fails and there's an accident you get into denial
[02:18:55.440 --> 02:19:01.120]  and you saw this at all at chernobyl three mile island and and fukushima initially the government
[02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:08.320]  says no problem it took uh almost nine years before uh the tmi owners admitted that there'd
[02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:18.880]  been a partial meltdown in the plant uh the um the uh third phase is uh is deception when it becomes
[02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:23.760]  obvious that there is a problem when people downwind start picking up radiation traces
[02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:29.760]  and say where is this coming from uh then you get into deception okay we have it under control
[02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:37.120]  in japan it's look at the radiation monitors which they took forever to install shows there's no
[02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:41.360]  problem let's stop right there at the third point and do the rest of the interview on the deception
[02:19:41.360 --> 02:19:46.880]  it's all covered in nuclear roulette i believe this is one of the greatest threats facing humanity
[02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:54.240]  is the fact that the nuclear energy industry is becoming collectively uh insane and self-destructive
[02:19:54.240 --> 02:19:58.160]  and if they want to kill themselves that's their business they're not going to kill me and my family
[02:19:58.160 --> 02:20:04.880]  we'll be right back with our guest gar smith stay with us we have witnessed two terrible storms in
[02:20:04.880 --> 02:20:10.320]  the east but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm the most devastating economic conditions
[02:20:10.320 --> 02:20:15.440]  since the great depression america's worst drought in agricultural history and now the economic
[02:20:15.440 --> 02:20:20.800]  results of the presidential election this perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply

[02:24:11.360 --> 02:24:15.680]  numbers i've seen is most these reactors are 35 years old they were supposed to only run 25 to
[02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:20.960]  30 years and the radiation starts eating them the heat eats them they're just falling apart
[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:26.240]  everywhere and their answer is store the rods there oh you're allowed to off gas radiation's
[02:24:26.240 --> 02:24:33.120]  now safe just like du in 1990 they've they'd had it since the 50s and there were army reports
[02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:39.840]  i've had the former head of the army program um dr. dug rocky on physicist uh who was the
[02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:44.160]  head of their du program and they just said we can never use this but magically they said oh it's
[02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:50.480]  safe to use now and there's this magic wanding where they just say you know what isotopes are
[02:24:50.480 --> 02:24:56.080]  up all over the us just raise the level of isotopes of what we say is safe 25 times 100
[02:24:56.080 --> 02:25:01.600]  times 200 times some isotopes over a thousand times radiation didn't go that high but why not
[02:25:01.600 --> 02:25:06.000]  raise it a billion times why not say you could live in the center of the sun and weigh the magic
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:12.560]  wand so so recapping the three stages with author and researcher uh gar smith best-selling
[02:25:12.560 --> 02:25:17.520]  author of nuclear roulette available at m4store.com hope you get it and read it because even if you
[02:25:17.520 --> 02:25:21.520]  know about it there's a lot to learn here and then give it to others gar this is short segment
[02:25:21.520 --> 02:25:27.760]  long segment coming up recap the first two levels you've got uh the first two levels then you were
[02:25:27.760 --> 02:25:31.840]  getting into deception and then go back into deception how they handle it now when you know a
[02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:36.640]  few months ago oh there's radiation up all over europe very dangerous oh yeah france had a leak but
[02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:41.920]  we're not going to say anything about it please continue yeah the government has uh not been
[02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:47.680]  a very reliable source of information and this this is a general trend too one of my favorite
[02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:53.680]  quotes is from dr natalia miranova she's a nuclear engineer from russia and she's one of the survivors
[02:25:53.680 --> 02:25:59.600]  of the chernobyl cleanup crew and her advice to americans when she visited san francisco a couple
[02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:09.840]  of years ago was um this is a quote run run as fast as you can don't believe the government
[02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:17.280]  the government will lie to you and you have to believe her because she wears the chernobyl necklace
[02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:22.560]  those are the scars left behind from two surgeries to remove thyroid tumors
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:30.560]  over in japan now the government wants people to feel relieved that the radiation monitors
[02:26:30.560 --> 02:26:36.400]  are showing lower levels of radiation somebody pointed out that the new systems that they've
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:44.320]  installed register radiation levels at 40 percent less than the previous monitors did but they but
[02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:48.880]  they admit that they this all came out they admitted they lied about the levels and they had kids
[02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:57.520]  dropping dead from heart failure from the radiation they just covered it up yeah um it's it's part of
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:27:03.040]  the the uh scenario you get it in all of these situations in all of these countries uh one of
[02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:10.000]  the problems that i i have identified i'm calling the rig the regulatory industrial complex you have
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:15.200]  these organizations that we are told are supposed to be providing oversight and protection for the
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:22.240]  public but instead they're acting too often as enablers you have individuals with the nrc who
[02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:28.720]  as inspectors in these plants are finding some real problems and reporting them but at the top
[02:27:28.720 --> 02:27:37.360]  level you find the nrc is going out of its way to um facilitate the operation of reactors that
[02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:43.360]  should have been closed down and the Associated Press they deserve the biggest reporting warden
[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:51.520]  in the world for a survey that they did they took a look at 11 000 nrc documents to see what
[02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:57.920]  the situation looked like from inside a nuclear reactor no ordinarily you don't get to see the
[02:27:57.920 --> 02:28:05.280]  photographs that the nrc put in this in these reports rusted pipes leaking water this does not
[02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:12.480]  look like a a sensible modern industrial plant but the innards of these these uh some some places you
[02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:18.560]  can't even get inside the the reactor components to see how how they're performing they're they're
[02:28:18.560 --> 02:28:26.080]  just so difficult to reach but this this is a summary that the ap came up with federal regulators
[02:28:26.080 --> 02:28:30.400]  have been working closely with the nuclear power industry to keep the nation's aging reactors
[02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:36.880]  operating within safety standards how by repeatedly weakening those standards or simply failing to
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:43.360]  enforce them a little more detail quote when valves leaked the leakage was a lot more leakage was
[02:28:43.360 --> 02:28:49.600]  allowed up to 20 times the original limit when rampant cracking caused radioactive leaps leaks
[02:28:49.600 --> 02:28:55.600]  from steam generator tubing an easier test was devised so that the plants could meet the standards
[02:28:55.600 --> 02:29:05.440]  goes on and on it's so frustrating too because i have three children and i know as dr bob bowman
[02:29:05.440 --> 02:29:10.160]  who's a nuclear physicist a former head of the star wars program has said here when things like
[02:29:10.160 --> 02:29:14.720]  share noble or things like fukushima happen it just increases the cancer rate for the general
[02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:20.480]  public at large but if you get a hot particle that was carried on dust or whatever then you just get
[02:29:20.480 --> 02:29:25.040]  the lung cancer when you're 20 you know people that get it today who are five years old and they
[02:29:25.040 --> 02:29:30.400]  just say oh you got lung cancer and and so if you get the it's like russian roulette as you call it
[02:29:30.400 --> 02:29:36.640]  nuclear roulette with these hot particles and and the thing is the nuclear industry is getting worse
[02:29:36.640 --> 02:29:40.080]  and worse and then we have all these cases as you know in southern california and other places
[02:29:40.080 --> 02:29:44.640]  where they've had total meltdowns before like the salt reactor and then no one even knows about
[02:29:44.640 --> 02:29:49.120]  that today even though it's declassified they keep it secret when they melt down let's talk about that
[02:29:49.120 --> 02:29:57.600]  when we come back we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[02:33:14.720 --> 02:33:21.680]  here's dave mustane with countdown to extinction song about uh when you've got the last animal a
[02:33:21.680 --> 02:33:29.840]  lot of species are people that'll pay millions of dollars crank it up to walk up and shoot it right
[02:33:29.840 --> 02:33:46.400]  there in the cage and what we have is our own species the technocrats they are treating us like
[02:33:46.400 --> 02:33:53.360]  animals as well and they have a nihilistic attitude uh also one of this gmo sterilizes people there are
[02:33:53.360 --> 02:33:58.480]  too many people uh so what are these reactors blow up you don't think we'd always be here do you and
[02:33:58.480 --> 02:34:05.280]  it's just also rich guys can live in bigger hundred million dollar mansions that have more billions
[02:34:05.280 --> 02:34:10.880]  than the next guy showing off at cocktail parties it literally gets down to that from some of the top
[02:34:10.880 --> 02:34:16.240]  stock brokers and billionaires that i've talked to on record and off record and again i'm all for
[02:34:16.240 --> 02:34:22.400]  making money with an invention or a device and i'm all for low taxes it's the crony capitalist
[02:34:23.680 --> 02:34:28.720]  the monopoly capitalist who are so nihilistic and the thing is they sell their whole agenda 21
[02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:34.720]  takeover on the in the name of saving the earth while all they do is say they want to tax carbon
[02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:43.120]  dioxide or in san diego arrest you if there's runoff from washing your car again it's a tyranny
[02:34:43.120 --> 02:34:49.120]  and the corporations are all exempt and meanwhile i've looked at it i've i've talked to the experts
[02:34:49.120 --> 02:34:56.320]  i've deeply investigated this and we knew day one they weren't showing for three or four months any
[02:34:56.320 --> 02:35:03.120]  of the numbers out of the fukushima area and and out of that uh province that's why it showed three
[02:35:03.120 --> 02:35:07.760]  times the radiation in tokyo a couple provinces you know south of there that they had there and
[02:35:07.760 --> 02:35:12.560]  then now it came out they had a tokyo electric apologize leaders upon yeah we covered up the
[02:35:12.560 --> 02:35:17.600]  numbers yeah we didn't want to panic meanwhile it turned out three months after fukushima tuna
[02:35:17.600 --> 02:35:24.080]  hit the west coast and the government tested the tuna they knew it had very dangerous isotopes
[02:35:24.080 --> 02:35:28.480]  centered at high levels and they said you know what we'll just raise the level it's safe let
[02:35:28.480 --> 02:35:33.040]  them eat the tuna and again as corrupt as our government's been in the past they didn't use to
[02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:38.800]  act like this from my research i mean this is crazy you've got things much bigger than three
[02:35:38.800 --> 02:35:43.440]  mile island happening what was it in 59 they had assault reactor blow up in southern california
[02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:48.720]  radiated people huge event that wasn't known till the 90s in fact i'll pull up that article and
[02:35:48.720 --> 02:35:54.880]  show people i'm ranting here but gar smith is our guest you were getting into we went to break
[02:35:54.880 --> 02:36:00.880]  the deception the coverups and where they're going am i wrong from my research and kind of a snapshot
[02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:06.720]  compared to your research and saying they're getting more reckless by the day or is or is that
[02:36:06.720 --> 02:36:14.240]  just that i'm becoming more informed and they've always been reckless i yeah i think recklessness
[02:36:14.240 --> 02:36:22.320]  is built into the technology uh there's no way on god's green earth that uh an engineer an engineering
[02:36:22.320 --> 02:36:27.920]  plan that would create a nuclear reactor could be considered logically sustainable
[02:36:29.280 --> 02:36:34.880]  i was talking with mar furtel who's a nuclear industry representative and he he made the
[02:36:34.880 --> 02:36:41.760]  statement that nuclear energy was essential because we needed electricity and i pointed out to him
[02:36:41.760 --> 02:36:48.560]  at a public meeting and he nodded his head in agreement when i i insisted that nuclear energy
[02:36:48.560 --> 02:36:53.920]  does not produce electricity it produces only two things the first is a lot of heat
[02:36:54.560 --> 02:37:00.160]  and the second is a lot of radioactive garbage there are a lot of things that produce heat
[02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:05.200]  there are a lot of ways to generate steam and it's the steam that generates the electricity
[02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:12.240]  through the turbine spinning so we could have geothermal wind coal natural gas hydroelectric
[02:37:12.240 --> 02:37:19.200]  the list goes on and on yeah and there is one irony uh among all of our energy sector players
[02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:24.880]  there's there's only one industry that believes in global warming it's not coal it's not nuclear
[02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:34.080]  it's not gas it's the i'm sorry it is the nuclear industry because they argue new global warming
[02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:40.000]  can be solved with nuclear energy because we don't produce co2 gases well uh that's why
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:48.160]  ambient has endorsed it yeah i know it's it's such a narrow focus because the the carbon dioxide is
[02:37:48.160 --> 02:37:53.920]  produced when you build the plant when you extract the ore when you refine the product when you create
[02:37:53.920 --> 02:37:59.280]  the fuel assemblies when you do all of the shipping and then eventually the dismantling the only time
[02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:07.520]  it doesn't uh produce co2 is when it's busy producing huge amounts of unused heat and radioactive
[02:38:07.520 --> 02:38:12.560]  isotopes that are puffied away from the plants but listen you're you're totally right on record
[02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:17.040]  that the plants are rotting falling apart the associated press admits that my issue here is
[02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:21.840]  i understand people think carbon dioxide goes up it can make the sea levels rise
[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:25.760]  let's just for the sake of arguments say that's real which i disagree with from the scientists
[02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:31.040]  we've interviewed still reactors rotting and melting down everywhere is a lot bigger deal
[02:38:31.040 --> 02:38:35.280]  why don't environmentalists get upset about nuclear power instead of embracing it because
[02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:40.640]  the big global warming advocates george mom biog you know the list they are just saying i love it
[02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:46.320]  in fact his quote was i believe in nuclear power more after fukushima i mean what type of asinine
[02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:51.680]  statement is that that's like an culture saying the radiation is good for you the japanese should
[02:38:51.680 --> 02:39:00.560]  thank the nuclear industry yeah well we we do have uh the the unholy triad of george and
[02:39:00.560 --> 02:39:08.080]  steward brand and uh uh loveless who are supporting nuclear power but that doesn't mean the majority
[02:39:08.080 --> 02:39:15.920]  of of environmentalists uh have the same line these are guys who have uh prominent uh celebrity
[02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:21.600]  positions which are not reflective of the uh so they're shelling out okay here's a nuclear the
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:28.880]  most dangerous thing in your opinion of the environment uh yeah the most uh dangerous
[02:39:28.880 --> 02:39:35.360]  man-made uh technology that i think we've ever developed okay well so if it's getting worse i
[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:39.440]  mean where do you predict it's going to go now that they're going to even build more old design
[02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:44.880]  reactors and and then keep the old ones going well they're actually uh they they want to keep
[02:39:44.880 --> 02:39:49.040]  the old ones going because it's a way of continuing to make money instead of facing up the fact that
[02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:55.040]  eventually they're supposed to tear these things down uh they do want to build new new design
[02:39:55.040 --> 02:40:01.600]  reactors uh in the us down in georgia and south carolina they want to build these ap 1000s and
[02:40:01.600 --> 02:40:06.400]  they're getting huge billion dollar government loan guarantees to do it but the construction
[02:40:06.400 --> 02:40:12.480]  isn't going too well and the prospects are are not too bright uh that they'll ever be finished uh
[02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:18.400]  or safely operated and the basic design of these things was so problematic that uh not even the
[02:40:18.400 --> 02:40:25.840]  nrc could get a unanimous vote out of five to uh uh have a unanimous approval of the design the
[02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:31.920]  former uh chair of the nuclear regulatory commission refused to vote for these new ap 1000 reactors
[02:40:31.920 --> 02:40:38.400]  because he said the uh engineering plan had not taken in the lessons of fukushima and getting back
[02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:42.880]  to fukushima we should bear in mind that those reactors that exploded in japan were not japanese
[02:40:42.880 --> 02:40:50.000]  reactors they were us here's made by general electric and the basic lesson there is when you
[02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:56.240]  have three reactors side by side that explode sequentially one after another one two three
[02:40:56.240 --> 02:41:03.040]  and the fourth which got damaged what that tells you is that that design it's not designed just
[02:41:03.040 --> 02:41:10.240]  to produce a lot of heat it was inadvertently designed as we now see to explode we have 23
[02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:19.920]  fukushima-style reactors in the united states at 16 sites in 12 states the nrc has put out a list
[02:41:19.920 --> 02:41:29.040]  of 27 us reactors that are most at risk of uh a calamity in the event of a major uh local earthquake
[02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:37.440]  on that list of 27 five our fukushima-style reactors um there should be some concern
[02:41:37.440 --> 02:41:45.440]  not only about uh the threat from earthquakes which we now know are much higher in the midwest
[02:41:45.440 --> 02:41:51.360]  and the uh and the southeast where most of the historic large quakes have hit and where most
[02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:58.720]  of our reactors are located and also we should be paying attention to the warnings from nasa
[02:41:58.720 --> 02:42:06.400]  and the national academy of sciences that we are entering a maximum solar year it's already begun
[02:42:06.400 --> 02:42:14.480]  we are getting hit with solar flares that are going to increase in frequency and in in impact
[02:42:14.480 --> 02:42:17.680]  and i want to expand on that briefly because that's what a lot of scientists have been on
[02:42:17.680 --> 02:42:21.360]  say is the biggest threat because it can blow out the power systems and you have more meltdowns
[02:42:21.360 --> 02:42:26.080]  which has been proven but you know before with the pre-nuclear events to to the power system
[02:42:26.080 --> 02:42:32.880]  in russia and other areas but what about all the insane ideas of now going to nuclear powered
[02:42:32.880 --> 02:42:37.840]  spacecraft and they're saying oh it's totally safe we want to start launching a rocket every month
[02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:42.160]  and nuclear powered satellites when all the research i've seen says that when those rockets
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:47.520]  fail which they do around 10 percent of the time it could end up blowing up in the atmosphere
[02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:52.560]  and then you've got a big problem it's already happened it's happened a couple of times so
[02:42:52.560 --> 02:42:59.600]  we had a russian reactor that uh burned out of orbit and slammed into the andes we have a us
[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:06.000]  uh uh system that crashed into the ocean with a nuclear power plant we've uh uh
[02:43:06.560 --> 02:43:13.760]  orbited plutonium powered spacecraft into deep space but in order to reach deep space somebody
[02:43:13.760 --> 02:43:19.200]  came up with the idea of using the earth's gravitational pull is kind of like a a bolo
[02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:26.560]  a slingshot a slingshot exactly and that meant that we fired this this uh system with this plutonium
[02:43:26.560 --> 02:43:31.840]  core reactor out into space intending that it come back toward the earth and that it clipped the
[02:43:31.840 --> 02:43:36.960]  earth's orbit and then circle the planet and zip back out even further that's a great idea
[02:43:37.600 --> 02:43:43.280]  but look at the risk what if that had missed what if there had been some kind of a terrible error
[02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:49.040]  that would have slammed into the planet well look at all the space disasters is one of the most
[02:43:49.040 --> 02:43:57.120]  dangerous things mm-hmm has a huge margin of a disaster yeah these you know when you're dealing
[02:43:57.120 --> 02:44:03.760]  with imponderables and and uh the likelihood of error you really shouldn't be dealing on a level
[02:44:03.760 --> 02:44:09.840]  of uh uh nuclear potential garr what's garr garr why is it the mad scientist they get in charge
[02:44:09.840 --> 02:44:13.360]  i guess they'll tell the government bureaucrats where they want i'm sure you've seen i talk
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:20.400]  about a lot about it uh uh new trinity trinity and beyond like 10 years ago or longer narrigated by
[02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:27.440]  narrigated narrated by william shatner and in that it shows what i'd read about but it's the film
[02:44:27.440 --> 02:44:32.480]  footage of them detonating hundreds of high-powered hydrogen bombs and the upper atmosphere to quote
[02:44:32.480 --> 02:44:39.280]  see if they could damage the atmosphere i mean who are these people why are they doing this
[02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:47.440]  uh i i i sometimes think of this as uh uh teenage science you know teenage boy sciences
[02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:54.320]  what why do you do it just to see if we can do it you know let's let's put this firecracker in
[02:44:54.320 --> 02:44:58.560]  this can or inside this watermelon and light it off and see what happened or inside this
[02:44:58.560 --> 02:45:04.960]  frog if you're george w bush oh yeah he's he's done that and i mean these are the guys that
[02:45:04.960 --> 02:45:12.320]  came up with the idea to explode a nuclear bomb on the moon exactly it's it's it's it's or they
[02:45:12.320 --> 02:45:17.440]  wanted to do cross tests to go drill down to the edge of the mantle and detonate one but that got
[02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:23.200]  nixed at least we're told it did these are crazy people yeah and these these are just the stunts
[02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:29.360]  that we know about god knows what they've been doing in the last month oh man and with harp and
[02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:35.920]  all the rest of it okay so we're almost out of time here the books available at info or store.com
[02:45:35.920 --> 02:45:40.000]  and better book stores everywhere it's the best seller nuclear roulette i've read the book it's
[02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:43.920]  absolute i learned a lot from it and believe me i've probably done let's not exaggerate a hundred
[02:45:43.920 --> 02:45:48.080]  interviews with top experts over the years on this subject and read a lot of books i learned a lot
[02:45:48.080 --> 02:45:51.920]  and i just see this is one of the biggest threats to my family i think in closing i interrupted your
[02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:56.880]  train of thought with the space based stuff finishing up with the solar flare emp danger
[02:45:56.880 --> 02:46:03.360]  here well yeah this is something we know about we've been warned uh it could knock us out for
[02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:08.560]  uh four to ten years according to nasa according to the national academy of sciences we know what
[02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:14.640]  we can do uh we need to protect the ultra high voltage uh transformers in the united states there's
[02:46:14.640 --> 02:46:20.800]  350 of them we can put in ground resistors for only two billion right let's you know
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:25.760]  for the pentagon that's chump change and we could do that there was a building in the senate
[02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:31.120]  called the shield act we got to act on that bring it back um that the problem's not going away it's
[02:46:31.120 --> 02:46:35.040]  only going to get worse it's only going to come sooner so we got to act now that's that's something
[02:46:35.040 --> 02:46:39.120]  that we need to do we know earthquakes are going to post problem but we definitely know that the
[02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:45.040]  solar flares are are really something that we have to wake up to and deal with for folks who
[02:46:45.040 --> 02:46:49.440]  don't know it's happened a bunch in the u.s but also in europe since they put up telegraph wires and
[02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:54.560]  things and they think it gets roughly a hundred-year cycle their sub cycles but a hundred years ago all
[02:46:54.560 --> 02:46:58.320]  over the world different times generally we've pulled up the dates on air before you can look
[02:46:58.320 --> 02:47:03.120]  it up when these solar flares hit right and all that ionizing different particles come in
[02:47:03.120 --> 02:47:09.920]  it literally can melt wires across continents and if that happens today folks we are in deep trouble
[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:16.640]  yeah we got hit with a solar flare in 89 it knocked out the power to six million canadians and it
[02:47:16.640 --> 02:47:23.360]  also uh melted a transformer at the salem one reactor in in the u.s and that was a small one
[02:47:23.360 --> 02:47:30.560]  they've i've had a different uh astrophysicist on saying that routinely stuff 20 30 times bigger
[02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:35.120]  hits mm-hmm can you imagine what happens if a really big one hits when they say it could just
[02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:41.440]  be unbelievable hate to think about it what are the estimates on exactly from your research how
[02:47:41.440 --> 02:47:46.400]  bad it could be of what's the highest rate on one of those flares that we could survive i forget
[02:47:46.400 --> 02:47:52.080]  the name of it is it called an m1 what are they called yeah i i think there's a five level a five
[02:47:52.080 --> 02:47:57.680]  tier level uh for flares i'm not exactly sure but just from memory i mean i mean the level
[02:47:57.680 --> 02:48:03.200]  we're talking about some estimates are it could knock out every reactor in north america uh well
[02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:08.560]  yeah implicitly if you lose the power and if you don't have backup if your diesel generators don't
[02:48:08.560 --> 02:48:13.920]  have uh enough uh juice to keep running until the powers are stored and if you're talking about power
[02:48:13.920 --> 02:48:18.880]  restoration that's going to be for for closed for a period of months to two years all of those
[02:48:18.880 --> 02:48:23.840]  reactors are going to fail they're going to melt down they're going to run away and believe me you
[02:48:24.480 --> 02:48:31.440]  as big a problem as as decommissioning these reactors is now the the estimate is uh it it's
[02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:37.280]  going to cost half a half a billion to a billion dollars to closed on every reactor and 10 years
[02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:44.160]  to decommission and uh isolate the the wastes in the case of fukushima they are estimating
[02:48:44.160 --> 02:48:49.120]  that it's going to take a hundred and thirty seven billion dollars and 30 years that's right with
[02:48:50.400 --> 02:48:55.360]  so it still won't be completely mitigated in closing you know my big issue here is look at
[02:48:55.360 --> 02:49:01.840]  sandy we're three weeks into this large areas still don't have power and that is microscopic
[02:49:01.840 --> 02:49:06.720]  compared to a big solar flare i'm the timing imagine and then the diesel runs out what two
[02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:15.280]  three weeks and then the reactors melt down and then you got the uh spent fuel in these g e reactors
[02:49:15.280 --> 02:49:21.840]  on the rooftops you're building a home is that where you put your garbage can well plus that
[02:49:21.840 --> 02:49:28.800]  well what that mox reactor even had plutonium in it it blew up yeah yeah the the third reactor
[02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:36.000]  uh they were using a mix of uh military grade uh uranium uh byproduct this is uh i mean it's
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:40.800]  it's returning the favor because initially uh reactors the government gave the power plant
[02:49:40.800 --> 02:49:47.440]  operators uranium and in exchange they got plutonium that they turned into uh buttons for nuclear
[02:49:47.440 --> 02:49:55.040]  triggers uh and now thanks to uh happily you know the the dismantling of some of the nuclear
[02:49:55.040 --> 02:50:01.040]  throw weight in in the russian missiles we're we're burning russian uh uranium product in our
[02:50:01.040 --> 02:50:06.800]  nuclear power plants that's the mox the mixed uranium oxide uh and as that nuclear expert said
[02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:13.040]  from russia run as fast as you can amazing ladies and gentlemen we can shut this down if we try
[02:50:13.040 --> 02:50:16.320]  and the environmentalists are just gonna have to sit there and be scared of the carbon dioxide
[02:50:16.320 --> 02:50:21.040]  plants breathe we're gonna again even if you think coal's deadly folks i'd say coal over nuclear
[02:50:21.040 --> 02:50:26.720]  any day nuclear roulette the truth about the most dangerous energy source on earth uh gar smith
[02:50:26.720 --> 02:50:33.280]  shut down the plants now and start prosecuting the people that have cut back the safety uh standards
[02:50:33.280 --> 02:50:39.200]  because they are endangering us all gar thank you for the time thank you all right folks get the book

[02:55:39.120 --> 02:55:46.560]  should have talked about this more now all over the country uh engine manufacturers uh tire
[02:55:46.560 --> 02:55:53.280]  manufacturers uh soda pop factories you just you will take flu shots in this whole list of other
[02:55:53.280 --> 02:55:58.480]  shots or you will be fired and it's totally criminal a it's deadly doesn't protect you
[02:55:58.480 --> 02:56:03.840]  uh lowers your immunity and it's just so evil it's one step closer to chinese factories where
[02:56:03.840 --> 02:56:09.040]  they do that and have forced abortions to work at the apple factories that's come out i mean
[02:56:09.040 --> 02:56:12.880]  it's just pure evil and they're also courts are really they're going to give kids shots
[02:56:12.880 --> 02:56:17.600]  without parental consent that's in the news today dave in connecticut what's your take on this i see
[02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:21.360]  that's in the line there that says employers and vaccines real quick what's going on with you
[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:26.880]  alex we have a patriot emergency up here that's the only way i can put it i've been a listener
[02:56:26.880 --> 02:56:32.880]  since 98 and the local hospital waterbury hospital has informed their employees that if
[02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:39.360]  they don't get a flu shot by tomorrow friday afternoon november 30th at 5 p.m they will be
[02:56:39.360 --> 02:56:45.120]  subject to a two-week suspension yeah you gotta sue them you gotta sue them for religious rights
[02:56:45.120 --> 02:56:50.880]  you've gotta sue them uh for forced uh for medical tyranny uh and bring in the eugenics hearings of
[02:56:50.880 --> 02:56:56.800]  the 2030s and 40s and and then you can present in the court case to the jury that all the evidence
[02:56:56.800 --> 02:57:03.200]  of it doubling your cancer chances of it of getting the flu and the insert that could
[02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:08.160]  cause neurological disorder and because they can't have a policy to make you do things like this to
[02:57:08.160 --> 02:57:14.000]  yourself it's discriminatory you they must be sued sorry go ahead here's what we're asking for
[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:18.720]  right now alex and we may very well do that the union is looking into it at the hospital one of
[02:57:18.720 --> 02:57:25.840]  the unions we're asking that your listeners if they help us just to call the waterbury hospital
[02:57:25.840 --> 02:57:30.000]  switchboard sure they've already tried this they've already tried this by the way five times the last
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:35.680]  10 years they're back you you will defeat them you must sue them with an injunction you bring in
[02:57:35.680 --> 02:57:39.600]  the medical stuff you get a lawyer that knows what they're doing you'll you will beat these people
[02:57:39.600 --> 02:57:43.760]  okay because they're doing this everywhere now not just the hospital next they want to make the cops
[02:57:43.760 --> 02:57:49.120]  and firefighters take it so look out cops they try this in o2 they're gonna make you do this too
[02:57:49.120 --> 02:57:55.440]  anyone who goes to a hospital whoever works they're tearing out trash food service you name it yes i
[02:57:55.440 --> 02:57:59.440]  was aware of that it's happening nationwide but i was aware of the town you're in give us the number
[02:58:00.320 --> 02:58:16.880]  203 573 6000 that's 203 573 6000 the ceo is darlene stromsted spromspead if you could just leave a
[02:58:16.880 --> 02:58:23.440]  one-line phone message to all you listeners to say that you object to their flu policy of forced
[02:58:23.440 --> 02:58:29.280]  vaccination of their employees just leave the phone message at the main switchboard for by the way
[02:58:29.280 --> 02:58:32.960]  by the way that is the number to waterbury hospital in or let people just give numbers
[02:58:32.960 --> 02:58:36.640]  out but i can tell by your tone that you're for real we checked it and i was already aware of
[02:58:36.640 --> 02:58:43.840]  waterbury doing that all right very very interesting out people we better fight this now thank you for
[02:58:43.840 --> 02:58:57.120]  listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today sodium fluoride in the body reduces iq and increases
