[00:00.000 --> 00:27.160]  Meanwhile, other key Trump supporters, including far-right media personalities, began promoting
[00:27.160 --> 00:34.960]  the wild protest on January 6th.
[00:34.960 --> 00:50.040]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, but I was at Bilderberg in 2006 in Canada, just been arrested
[00:50.040 --> 00:53.600]  trying to fly in, trying to cover it, it was a big media frenzy, back to the media, still
[00:53.600 --> 00:56.400]  stuck up for journalists, even though they didn't like me, and they released me after
[00:56.400 --> 00:59.960]  a day of being interrogated and screamed at and threatened with prison, and they finally
[00:59.960 --> 01:03.880]  released me, and when I got to the hotel, met with Jim Tucker, the hotel miles away
[01:03.880 --> 01:07.920]  from where Bilderberg was about to meet the next day, there was an old man at the bar
[01:07.920 --> 01:12.080]  drinking beer, he said, now it's like drinking beer with you, and I said, sure, he's a British
[01:12.080 --> 01:15.680]  man, I said, you live in Canada, he said, yeah, I've lived here since the 90s, and
[01:15.680 --> 01:19.120]  I didn't know he was dying at the time, he died a few months later, he said, you know,
[01:19.120 --> 01:23.160]  I used to be a well-known economist in the UK, and I've been at the highest level, the
[01:23.160 --> 01:26.320]  whole socialist global system, I've met with many of these people, and early on I kind
[01:26.320 --> 01:29.360]  of believed the lie they were selling about how it was utopia and freedom and the power
[01:29.360 --> 01:32.160]  of the average person, but really they want to make everybody poor and control them, and
[01:32.160 --> 01:37.480]  he said, I think you need to use this slogan I just developed, because I'm a mathematician,
[01:37.480 --> 01:42.280]  not just an economist, he said, but it's not an equation, it's an archetypal symbol
[01:42.280 --> 01:50.320]  and numbers, it's very eloquent, he said the answer to 1984 is 1776, and I interviewed
[01:50.320 --> 01:55.680]  him and talked to him, and it wasn't till we started looking into him for the film that
[01:55.680 --> 02:02.440]  he turned out he was the main economist to two prime ministers, he was the guy, he was
[02:02.440 --> 02:06.640]  super famous, I just, you know, didn't know that in the 80s he'd been, worked for Margaret
[02:06.640 --> 02:10.880]  Thatcher and all the rest of it, but the point is, that's where that came from, was from
[02:10.880 --> 02:16.600]  a Brit, which is perfect, because you know, our revolution came out of England, it was
[02:16.600 --> 02:20.960]  an extension of George Washington's grandparents and Thomas Jefferson's grandparents and
[02:20.960 --> 02:24.200]  people that came to the New World to get away from tyranny, and England had revolutions
[02:24.200 --> 02:30.520]  like ours trying to get freedom, so America is not an anti-British thing, America is not
[02:30.520 --> 02:36.880]  an anti-English-Saxon thing, America is not an anti, it comes out of Magna Carta in 1215,
[02:36.880 --> 02:42.880]  it comes out of all those wars and rebellions and fights for freedom in Ireland, in Scotland,
[02:42.880 --> 02:49.240]  in Wales, in Brittany, that is an extension of who we are, and it's so fitting that a
[02:49.240 --> 02:59.240]  Brit and an Economist came up with that powerful maxim that they fear so much, the answer to
[02:59.240 --> 03:05.240]  1984 is 1776!
[03:05.240 --> 03:31.240]  It's the young generation, like Prime Minister Trudeau, half of his government, are actually
[03:31.240 --> 03:38.240]  the young nobleness of the world, so we penetrate the cabinet, the change is not just happening,
[03:38.240 --> 03:43.240]  the change can be shaped by us.
[03:43.240 --> 03:49.240]  We have to prepare for a more angry world, how to prepare, to take the necessary action
[03:49.240 --> 03:53.240]  to create the fair world.
[03:53.240 --> 03:59.240]  I see the need for a great reset, so people assume we are just going back to the good
[03:59.240 --> 04:06.240]  old world which we had and everything will be normal again, this is, let's say, fiction,
[04:06.240 --> 04:08.240]  it will not happen.
[04:08.240 --> 04:16.240]  There is only one way this pandemic is going to go, it's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[04:16.240 --> 04:24.240]  Pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack which
[04:24.240 --> 04:32.240]  would bring to a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services,
[04:32.240 --> 04:36.240]  our society as a whole.
[04:36.240 --> 04:45.240]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison
[04:45.240 --> 05:00.240]  to a major cyber attack.
[05:33.240 --> 05:40.240]  It is incredible and what's even more incredible is it funds the info war, so the only way
[05:40.240 --> 05:47.240]  to fail is not taking action today and ordering bodies ultimate tumor formula at infowarstore.com.
[05:47.240 --> 05:49.240]  It is simply amazing.
[05:49.240 --> 05:57.240]  Discover the power of the humanoids at 95% at infowarstore.com today with bodies ultimate
[05:57.240 --> 06:04.240]  tumor formula.
[06:04.240 --> 06:10.240]  It is Thursday, July 21st.
[06:10.240 --> 06:15.240]  Once you constitute, get ready, America, get ready, America.
[06:15.240 --> 06:24.240]  Info wars, the most banned network in the world.
[06:24.240 --> 06:34.240]  The most banned network in the world.
[06:34.240 --> 07:00.240]  And because it was a four lane highway that was accessible, my mother drove us and rather
[07:00.240 --> 07:04.240]  than us being able to walk, and guess what?
[07:04.240 --> 07:07.240]  The first frost, you know what was happening.
[07:07.240 --> 07:12.240]  You had to put on your windshield wipers to get literally the oil slick off the window.
[07:12.240 --> 07:17.240]  That's why I and so damn many other people I grew up have cancer and why can't for the
[07:17.240 --> 07:21.240]  longest time, Delaware had the highest cancer rate in the nation.
[07:21.240 --> 07:26.240]  Climate change is literally an existential threat to our nation and to the world.
[07:26.240 --> 07:33.240]  So my message today is this, since Congress is not acting as it should, and these guys
[07:33.240 --> 07:38.240]  here are, but we're not getting many Republican votes, this is an emergency, an emergency.
[07:38.240 --> 07:41.240]  And I will, I will look at it that way.
[07:41.240 --> 07:46.240]  I said last week, I'll say it again loud and clear, as president, I'll use my executive
[07:46.240 --> 07:51.240]  powers to combat climate, the climate crisis in the absence of congressional actions.
[07:51.240 --> 07:55.240]  Now we're standing there in incredible action.
[07:55.240 --> 07:57.240]  Climate change is an emergency.
[07:57.240 --> 08:01.240]  And in the coming weeks, I'm going to use the power I have as president to turn these
[08:01.240 --> 08:06.240]  words into formal, official, government actions through the appropriate proclamations,
[08:06.240 --> 08:12.240]  executive orders, and regulatory power that the president possesses.
[08:12.240 --> 08:17.240]  And they released the plan yesterday, but he hasn't said he's going to implement it
[08:17.240 --> 08:24.240]  right away to shut off U.S. energy to ban exports, to ban drilling, you name it.
[08:24.240 --> 08:28.240]  If you think shutting off the Keystone pipeline was bad, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[08:28.240 --> 08:32.240]  What an incredible time to be alive.
[08:32.240 --> 08:38.240]  You have the kleptocratic global corporations using governments and systems to rob everybody.
[08:38.240 --> 08:39.240]  They see the collapse coming.
[08:39.240 --> 08:40.240]  They've engineered.
[08:40.240 --> 08:45.240]  They offer us the great reset as a solution, which only makes it 10 times worse.
[08:45.240 --> 08:47.240]  And they really think they're going to get away with this.
[08:47.240 --> 08:53.240]  But a theme emerged when I was looking over the news last night this morning of a system
[08:53.240 --> 09:00.240]  in total crisis and of the rats leaving the sinking ship.
[09:00.240 --> 09:09.240]  We have Birks, the number two in the Trump administration in healthcare, saying Fauci
[09:09.240 --> 09:13.240]  lied and that she lied.
[09:13.240 --> 09:18.240]  And I have stacks of mainstream articles in the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Germany saying,
[09:18.240 --> 09:23.240]  you know what, those shots don't work, but you still got to take them.
[09:23.240 --> 09:28.240]  And we got a new super shot coming, which we predicted they were going to be rolling out.
[09:28.240 --> 09:31.240]  We saw Bill Gates pre-looting it.
[09:31.240 --> 09:37.240]  And the new shot will completely destroy your immune system to the next level.
[09:37.240 --> 09:39.240]  What a time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:39.240 --> 09:42.240]  What a time to be chronicling all of this.
[09:42.240 --> 09:45.240]  It just makes the head spin.
[09:45.240 --> 09:47.240]  But here's the big takeaway.
[09:47.240 --> 09:54.240]  We'll be opening the phones up today throughout the four-hour broadcast and talking about this with you.
[09:54.240 --> 09:57.240]  They're getting ready to get rid of Biden.
[09:57.240 --> 10:02.240]  Obama's placeholder in his third administration is stolen third term.
[10:02.240 --> 10:07.240]  How are they going to do it is the big question, and that's why.
[10:07.240 --> 10:12.240]  Oh, now mainstream media says it's imminent the indictment of Hunter Biden.
[10:12.240 --> 10:18.240]  So then Joe Biden steps down, but pardons himself, his son and others.
[10:18.240 --> 10:21.240]  That's where the smart money is, or they're going to kill it.
[10:21.240 --> 10:28.240]  Oh, and he's had COVID three times now since he took four shots in all the statistics show.
[10:28.240 --> 10:30.240]  You get COVID from the shots.
[10:30.240 --> 10:32.240]  Just unbelievable.
[10:32.240 --> 10:37.240]  But then all the video clips of him saying, if you have the shot, you're protected and you can't get COVID
[10:37.240 --> 10:39.240]  and you can't spread COVID.
[10:39.240 --> 10:46.240]  We have Rachel Maddow saying it as well and many others, but he continues to say it.
[10:46.240 --> 10:55.240]  Feeding the public a continual torrent of absolute pure bull.
[10:55.240 --> 11:01.240]  And all the fools in the corporate media and the corporations and the lawyers and all of them,
[11:01.240 --> 11:06.240]  going along with this pretending that they're on a winning team,
[11:06.240 --> 11:11.240]  all they're doing is blowing holes in the bottom of the lifeboats.
[11:11.240 --> 11:12.240]  Total insanity.
[11:12.240 --> 11:18.240]  And it made me think before I went live today about the frustration of people that work with the system
[11:18.240 --> 11:24.240]  and think they're part of this corrupt predatory system that's destroying our society or civilization,
[11:24.240 --> 11:32.240]  our rule of law, the social contract, that they're like stockbrokers and investment fund
[11:32.240 --> 11:38.240]  and hedge fund managers, hundreds of which on record, talked to their families on 9-11.
[11:38.240 --> 11:43.240]  They were in the north and south towers before they blew up and collapsed.
[11:43.240 --> 11:48.240]  That's why we have the press reports of honey, baby, I can't come home.
[11:48.240 --> 11:50.240]  I can't get out of the building.
[11:50.240 --> 11:56.240]  I'm making tens of millions of dollars a minute because everybody was panicking in the market.
[11:56.240 --> 12:00.240]  We call them suicide bankers.
[12:00.240 --> 12:01.240]  And that's who they are.
[12:01.240 --> 12:06.240]  So the bureaucrats and the academics and the bankers and the lawyers and the military leadership
[12:06.240 --> 12:11.240]  and the law enforcement leadership and everybody going along with this psychotic,
[12:11.240 --> 12:22.240]  satanic, anti-human collapse program are pretending that they're on a winning team
[12:22.240 --> 12:25.240]  and they're not on any team at all.
[12:25.240 --> 12:27.240]  So we're going to be covering it all today.
[12:27.240 --> 12:31.240]  Something that broke yesterday while we were on air, that I didn't get to, that's also so huge,
[12:31.240 --> 12:36.240]  which we already know, is the theory of chemical imbalance for depression
[12:36.240 --> 12:41.240]  in hundreds of major studies.
[12:41.240 --> 12:47.240]  Is it true and that antidepressants make the average person more depressed
[12:47.240 --> 12:51.240]  and, in the end, psychotic?
[12:51.240 --> 12:53.240]  What an incredible admission.
[12:53.240 --> 12:58.240]  And why is that admission coming now? Because now they're coming out with the behavioral shots
[12:58.240 --> 13:06.240]  that supposedly fix your problems by having these, quote,
[13:06.240 --> 13:09.240]  nanotech systems rearrange the brain.
[13:09.240 --> 13:11.240]  That's all coming up today.
[13:11.240 --> 13:14.240]  Massive COVID news, massive Second Amendment news.
[13:14.240 --> 13:19.240]  Democrats openly admit gun control bill will confiscate firearms in common use.
[13:19.240 --> 13:23.240]  Quote, hell yes, we'll take your AR-15.
[13:23.240 --> 13:25.240]  That's all coming up as well today.
[13:25.240 --> 13:29.240]  And again, opening the phones up at the bottom of the hour for first-time callers
[13:29.240 --> 13:32.240]  at least in the first round.
[13:32.240 --> 13:36.240]  But I, myself, am just completely blown away by how fast this is moving.
[13:36.240 --> 13:38.240]  I knew it was coming. I knew they were planning it.
[13:38.240 --> 13:43.240]  But man, I hoped that we'd expose them enough to where they wouldn't have the Hutzpah,
[13:43.240 --> 13:51.240]  the thought of the hubris, the insane will to power that would actually back off of this.
[13:51.240 --> 13:56.240]  But because of lower IQs, even the establishment and just not three-dimensional,
[13:56.240 --> 13:59.240]  fourth-dimensional, fifth-dimensional thinking, they're going ahead with it.
[13:59.240 --> 14:02.240]  We're going to try to continue on as long as we can.
[14:02.240 --> 14:04.240]  And our work is more important now than it's ever been,
[14:04.240 --> 14:08.240]  thanks to all of your work promoting InfoWars and supporting us and everything you've done.
[14:08.240 --> 14:12.240]  I want to encourage everybody not to wait and realize InfoWars needs support now,

[14:17.240 --> 14:21.240]  trials and all the attacks and everything that's going on.
[14:21.240 --> 14:24.240]  If we get the funds, we'll continue to fight as hard as ever.
[14:24.240 --> 14:31.240]  If not, I've left it all in the field and I'll still be here in any capacity I can.

[17:21.240 --> 17:27.240]  We went and looked at the top 10 and they all had the same ingredients in common that is in this product.
[17:27.240 --> 17:31.240]  But with our new product from X7, Diet Force,
[17:31.240 --> 17:40.240]  we got the very best concentrates of these known natural essences that just do amazing things for your body.
[17:40.240 --> 17:44.240]  And so, I've lost almost 40 pounds, I'm so a little bit overweight, in the last three months
[17:44.240 --> 17:48.240]  and I've been doing things in Diet Force and also exercise.
[17:48.240 --> 17:54.240]  Well, now Diet Force is exclusively available right now at InfoWarsStore.com, 40% off.
[17:54.240 --> 17:59.240]  InfoWarsStore.com, Diet Force. You need to take this product, it really works.
[17:59.240 --> 18:05.240]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or a pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire.
[18:05.240 --> 18:10.240]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles, you see it every year.
[18:10.240 --> 18:12.240]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers.
[18:12.240 --> 18:15.240]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[18:15.240 --> 18:20.240]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[18:20.240 --> 18:25.240]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this.
[18:25.240 --> 18:30.240]  So, it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody.
[18:30.240 --> 18:36.240]  To be able to do things tax wise, it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money.
[18:36.240 --> 18:41.240]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[18:41.240 --> 18:47.240]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com.
[18:47.240 --> 18:52.240]  One word, jonestaxrelief.com, or call 833-900-4285.
[18:52.240 --> 18:56.240]  833-900-4285.
[19:00.240 --> 19:05.240]  InfoWars has made history. You have made history in your support of InfoWars.
[19:05.240 --> 19:11.240]  And one of the biggest tools we've had to circumvent and override the sensors has been patriot, apparel,
[19:11.240 --> 19:14.240]  so we can identify each other, so we can spread the word,
[19:14.240 --> 19:17.240]  and so we can push people to websites like infowars.com
[19:17.240 --> 19:20.240]  so they can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it.
[19:20.240 --> 19:25.240]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced we're blowing out of all of our designs of t-shirts,
[19:25.240 --> 19:27.240]  some of which go back more than 25 years.
[19:27.240 --> 19:30.240]  All these shirts are limited edition, they are about to be history,
[19:30.240 --> 19:33.240]  and will only exist in your closet, your drawer, or your wardrobe.
[19:33.240 --> 19:37.240]  So, there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left.
[19:37.240 --> 19:40.240]  In a couple weeks they'll all be gone and they'll be history.
[19:40.240 --> 19:44.240]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarsstore.com.
[19:44.240 --> 19:46.240]  So thank you all for your support.
[19:46.240 --> 19:50.240]  Please visit infowarsstore.com and get one of these historic shirts,

[19:56.240 --> 19:59.240]  infowarsstore.com
[19:59.240 --> 20:07.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:17.240 --> 20:21.240]  The date is Thursday, July 21st, 2022.
[20:21.240 --> 20:29.240]  I am here in battle host Alex Jones, as we enter the operational phases
[20:29.240 --> 20:34.240]  of the New World Order global collapse, and 90% force the population.
[20:34.240 --> 20:37.240]  Many have chosen to lie themselves and say this isn't happening.
[20:37.240 --> 20:41.240]  Others have decided to fight and resist,
[20:41.240 --> 20:46.240]  and still others have decided to join evil, instead of stand against it,
[20:46.240 --> 20:48.240]  due to their fear.
[20:48.240 --> 20:53.240]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I'll give the toll-free number out when we end this segment.
[20:53.240 --> 20:57.240]  First-time callers are the first 20 or so calls, and we'll open it up for everybody after that.
[20:57.240 --> 21:03.240]  The first-time callers first on any of these huge issues on Biden and his energy power grab,
[21:03.240 --> 21:09.240]  but it's just unprecedented, with the fact that they announced these executive wars but didn't sign them.
[21:09.240 --> 21:11.240]  The report said they would be signing them yesterday,
[21:11.240 --> 21:15.240]  and he put the battle plan out that is so draconian it makes my head spin.
[21:15.240 --> 21:21.240]  A true loaded gun to the country's head to cut off all energy exports, cut off oil drilling,
[21:21.240 --> 21:25.240]  ban all fossil fuel investment in the U.S.
[21:25.240 --> 21:31.240]  Outside of law, the Supreme Court repudiated what the EPA was already doing, this by Fiat,
[21:31.240 --> 21:33.240]  three weeks ago, but this was his response.
[21:33.240 --> 21:37.240]  That's the big topic so many others to drill through and get through,
[21:37.240 --> 21:41.240]  and I never got at these clips yesterday, but coming up, we're going to get to them.
[21:41.240 --> 21:46.240]  Booty judge saying, hey, the head of the Department of Transportation,
[21:46.240 --> 21:48.240]  big deal we're going to ban your gas cars.
[21:48.240 --> 21:50.240]  Yeah, we're doing this to make you transition.
[21:50.240 --> 21:54.240]  And then out of the other side of his mouth, it's all the Russians.
[21:54.240 --> 21:58.240]  That's why this happened.
[21:58.240 --> 22:00.240]  Simply incredible.
[22:00.240 --> 22:02.240]  Let's continue to drill into this.
[22:02.240 --> 22:07.240]  Biden vows to bypass Congress to combat the climate crisis.
[22:07.240 --> 22:16.240]  And then this morning, President Biden tested positive for COVID-19 for the third time despite four shots.
[22:16.240 --> 22:21.240]  If you believe that twice boosted, that's two shots and then two boosters.
[22:21.240 --> 22:25.240]  President Biden tested positive for COVID-19.
[22:25.240 --> 22:33.240]  Confirmed tennis legend, Djokovic won't compete in the U.S. Open to the Biden's discriminatory vaccination policy.
[22:33.240 --> 22:38.240]  You got to have the experimental shot or you can't come here.
[22:38.240 --> 22:44.240]  Democrat House Majority Leader refuses to commit to supporting Biden's 2024 bid.
[22:44.240 --> 22:53.240]  Stinney Hoyer, they are getting ready to move old Pito Joe, old Pito Peter,
[22:53.240 --> 23:01.240]  out of there and in Kamala Harris and whoever she appoints to be a VP.
[23:01.240 --> 23:09.240]  The smart money is on Michael Obama, Michael Obama, also known as Michelle Obama.
[23:09.240 --> 23:14.240]  That's what Obama calls her in three videos, Michael.
[23:14.240 --> 23:23.240]  So Michael Obama, stunning and brave, or Gavin Newsom.
[23:23.240 --> 23:32.240]  And to help put pressure on Biden to move along, Fed's eye criminal charges for Hunter Biden's probe reached his critical stage.
[23:32.240 --> 23:37.240]  Oh, yeah, they suppressed it for the election to get the puppet in, but now it's reached the critical stage.
[23:37.240 --> 23:50.240]  And of course, you know, it's probably not probably most assuredly deep state elements that released his packed phone to be the final blow or the finale or they could agree.
[23:50.240 --> 24:01.240]  The Department of Justice is weighing possible charges against Hunter Biden and investigation into his business dealings and false statements involving his purchase of gun have reached a critical juncture.
[24:01.240 --> 24:14.240]  CNN reports sources say the probe is intensified in recent months with discussions among Delaware based prosecutors, investigators run the probe and officials of the Department of Justice headquarters.
[24:14.240 --> 24:25.240]  Although final decision has been made, the possibility of dropping charges on Hunter Biden would put a longstanding guideline to avoid bringing politically sensitive cases to an election.
[24:25.240 --> 24:31.240]  And it goes on from there.
[24:31.240 --> 24:37.240]  So they are moving Joe Biden out the door.
[24:37.240 --> 24:41.240]  What do you think of that?
[24:41.240 --> 24:46.240]  We'll be giving the toll free number out here in just a moment.
[24:46.240 --> 24:49.240]  And again, there's so much more to hit.
[24:49.240 --> 24:57.240]  We have this video coming up. Watch dims openly admit gun confiscation will confiscate firearms in common use.
[24:57.240 --> 25:03.240]  That's what their legislation does ties into the assault weapons ban.
[25:03.240 --> 25:05.240]  There are only a few votes away from getting.
[25:05.240 --> 25:15.240]  And then meanwhile, you've all the video shows cops holding back officer wanted to save his wife from gunman while they put hand sanitizer on and literally scratch their asses.
[25:15.240 --> 25:27.240]  And we have this footage of man saves five kids from a burning building while the police and fire departments sit there with their thumbs in their rear ends as usual.
[25:27.240 --> 25:30.240]  You're a bodega worker. Somebody's physically attacking you defend yourself.
[25:30.240 --> 25:32.240]  They try to put you in prison.
[25:32.240 --> 25:35.240]  If your parent tries to go and save your kids, you're bad.
[25:35.240 --> 25:42.240]  All the bureaucrats, which is the police more and more the other joining all the other bureaucrats, not all cops, but a lot of them.
[25:42.240 --> 25:46.240]  These leftist cities are just absolutely pathetic creatures.
[25:46.240 --> 25:54.240]  That would sit there and watch their own children killed quite frankly, because they love following orders because they've been selected because they follow orders.
[25:54.240 --> 26:03.240]  They're just a interim bridge to the robots running everything, who of course will follow all the new orders orders.
[26:03.240 --> 26:06.240]  And then we've got Euro tumbles.
[26:06.240 --> 26:18.240]  Got a bunch of economic news spreads blow out as market realizes ECBs TBI just another use for word salad.
[26:18.240 --> 26:21.240]  Wait till we describe what that really means.
[26:21.240 --> 26:33.240]  Minnesota theater caves to woke mom, cancels Dave Chappelle, who would I call a liberal and pretty damn leftist and a race baiter, though he's funny.
[26:33.240 --> 26:38.240]  Because he said, hey, men are taking over women's spaces.
[26:38.240 --> 26:40.240]  There's been attacked by transgender now.
[26:40.240 --> 26:42.240]  And now they're getting canceled.
[26:42.240 --> 26:44.240]  Because that's what the left does.
[26:44.240 --> 26:47.240]  They will destroy all speech, ladies and gentlemen.
[26:47.240 --> 27:03.240]  We have one or two state run mouthpieces, literal big brother heads on the television on the telescreens and popping up enforced feeds on our phones, barking their leftist orders at us 24 seven.
[27:03.240 --> 27:08.240]  Also, Vladimir Putin says humanity is entering a new era, a new stage of world history.
[27:08.240 --> 27:11.240]  We'll be getting that video and so much more today.
[27:11.240 --> 27:22.240]  But the toll free number to join us for first time callers on the energy power grab on the gun grab on the collapsing borders on the move to remove Biden.
[27:22.240 --> 27:23.240]  What's coming next?
[27:23.240 --> 27:29.240]  How do we peacefully fight back against the great reset on the huge upheaval around the world against it?
[27:29.240 --> 27:32.240]  A lot of big topics I'd like to hear from you on.
[27:32.240 --> 27:40.240]  It's a free for all as they say toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[27:40.240 --> 27:52.240]  877-789 Alex 877-789-2539 on this live Thursday worldwide broadcast.
[27:52.240 --> 27:58.240]  So much more we're going to be getting to here today as well.
[27:58.240 --> 28:06.240]  That I've not even mentioned or talked about but really the legislation to make the office of the presidency a dictatorship for domestic military operations.
[28:06.240 --> 28:11.240]  Against quote right wing extremists that's just over the top huge that almost no one else is covering.
[28:11.240 --> 28:16.240]  That ties into the climate emergency powers being announced by Biden, but he didn't fully announce them.
[28:16.240 --> 28:20.240]  Though the document he put out did he didn't fully put into executive order yet.
[28:20.240 --> 28:22.240]  We promise in the next few weeks.
[28:22.240 --> 28:28.240]  So that's really a gun the American people's head or is he waffling.
[28:28.240 --> 28:36.240]  We will discuss all of it 877-789-2539 877-789 Alex on the other side.
[28:36.240 --> 28:43.240]  And also wait to hear what Klaus Schwab's up to yet again.
[28:43.240 --> 28:50.240]  And you may have heard this before from Bill Gates, but blocking out the sun to save you and I.

[31:54.240 --> 31:58.240]  I can't wait for the reviews because it's worked great for me.
[31:58.240 --> 32:10.240]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the U.S. that supplies the highest quality signature reducing faraday cages, the Pentagon and other U.S. government agencies.
[32:10.240 --> 32:18.240]  And now they have produced specifically for us this Made in America onion line at a very affordable price.

[32:52.240 --> 33:18.240]  This is one of the hottest items out there today that's exclusively available at infowarsstore.com.
[33:18.240 --> 33:22.240]  Donald J. Trump is now president of the United States.
[33:22.240 --> 33:26.240]  It's not true. That's impossible.
[33:26.240 --> 33:49.240]  Such a thing you know it to be true.
[33:49.240 --> 33:52.240]  This is the heart of 1776.
[33:52.240 --> 33:54.240]  You're a white man.
[33:54.240 --> 33:59.240]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[33:59.240 --> 34:03.240]  We did get out the way.
[34:03.240 --> 34:10.240]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[34:10.240 --> 34:14.240]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[34:14.240 --> 34:18.240]  It's been a crazy relationship from the beginning.
[34:18.240 --> 34:24.240]  I'll let you down. You'll be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[34:24.240 --> 34:26.240]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[34:26.240 --> 34:32.240]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the United States.
[34:32.240 --> 34:34.240]  Waging war on corruption.
[34:34.240 --> 34:39.240]  It's Alex Jones.
[34:39.240 --> 34:45.240]  I wanted the crew to air a promo from four years ago, five years ago,
[34:45.240 --> 34:48.240]  and we have to get ready for Trump to run for president.
[34:48.240 --> 34:52.240]  He announced, as you know, Sunday that he is running.
[34:52.240 --> 34:54.240]  So we told you it was coming in July.
[34:54.240 --> 35:00.240]  He hasn't said when he's going to officially launch the campaign, but he said he's running.
[35:00.240 --> 35:05.240]  That's like a Muhammad Ali says, yeah, I'm going to fight Joe Frazier.
[35:05.240 --> 35:08.240]  The fight's on. They just haven't set the date yet.
[35:08.240 --> 35:13.240]  So it's going on and the left is going to go completely berserk yet again.
[35:13.240 --> 35:18.240]  But that's another topic for another day. You can call in about it if you'd like.
[35:18.240 --> 35:20.240]  I have real mixed feelings about Trump.
[35:20.240 --> 35:26.240]  Did a lot of good things on the border and the dollar and standing up to China and, you know,
[35:26.240 --> 35:31.240]  getting good Supreme Court justices, most of them, you know, are a lot better than Democrats.
[35:31.240 --> 35:41.240]  We've got the Roe v. Wade thing out of it, but man, did he screw the pooch when it came to the poison shots.
[35:41.240 --> 35:45.240]  That's why I aired that little piece that I had my own debate in my mind about it.
[35:45.240 --> 35:47.240]  It's a real quandary.
[35:47.240 --> 35:53.240]  But I got to tell you, a Trump to Santa's ticket that I'd heard was going on the scenes,
[35:53.240 --> 36:01.240]  but Barnes isn't a B.S. or when it comes to his political sources, he told me the sources.
[36:01.240 --> 36:11.240]  Of course, he obviously talks to Trump, but he talked to an individual that was there brokering the deal.
[36:11.240 --> 36:15.240]  And I don't talk to Barnes a lot. I've been so busy. He's busy. We talk maybe once a week about other topics.
[36:15.240 --> 36:21.240]  I don't know why in the hell he didn't tell me that he's had a specific inside details.
[36:21.240 --> 36:25.240]  Six months ago on the meeting with Trump and the Santas where the deal was made.
[36:25.240 --> 36:33.240]  Now, one of the two might change that deal down the road, but you notice Trump six months ago was bashing the Santas.
[36:33.240 --> 36:42.240]  Now you don't see that happening anymore. That is a pretty big deal, isn't it?
[36:42.240 --> 36:47.240]  Globalist puppets in free fall worldwide, removal of Biden imminent.
[36:47.240 --> 36:50.240]  Tune in as we debate what comes next.
[36:50.240 --> 36:54.240]  It's going to be a big broadcast and we got your calls there on the board.
[36:54.240 --> 36:59.240]  I already mentioned a lot of what we're going to be covering today, but in the interest of taking calls, which I find are great wildcards.
[36:59.240 --> 37:05.240]  Take some amazing directions. I'm going to go ahead and go to the calls and the order that they are received.
[37:05.240 --> 37:10.240]  Let's talk to a caller in California. Let's talk to Jules. Jules, welcome.
[37:10.240 --> 37:11.240]  Hello?
[37:11.240 --> 37:13.240]  Yes, Jules. Welcome.
[37:13.240 --> 37:18.240]  Alex, how's it going, man? I've been listening to you since I was 20 years old and a college student.
[37:18.240 --> 37:29.240]  I was a design major at Art Institute at the time it was owned by Goldman Sachs, which was kind of unfortunate because I had a feeling they were taking our designs and our projects and works and sending them over to China.
[37:29.240 --> 37:34.240]  But that's another topic. My wife wants to say hello real quick.
[37:34.240 --> 37:36.240]  Big fan.
[37:36.240 --> 37:38.240]  Big fan of you guys. God bless you.
[37:38.240 --> 37:42.240]  We've laughed with you. We've cried with you, man, and it's so good to finally talk to you.
[37:42.240 --> 37:50.240]  But anyway, I'll get to the point. What I was calling about was the programs that they use for CNC machining and prototyping and all that stuff.
[37:50.240 --> 38:00.240]  And in the midst of all this kind of news closing around the neck of the internet, it's going to be very hard in the future to be able to download free files and stuff like that.
[38:00.240 --> 38:06.240]  Take the AR50. It's a very easy program to download for somebody to be able to make themselves.
[38:06.240 --> 38:13.240]  And I think where they're going with these programs to where you can't like you can't outright buy them now, you have to pay them monthly.
[38:13.240 --> 38:22.240]  And that's kind of a sign, I think, towards going to where eventually they'll even try to they'll try to regulate who can even own those programs.
[38:22.240 --> 38:27.240]  That's right. They're putting surveillance and kill switches into all the new software.
[38:27.240 --> 38:35.240]  Exactly. And they're also what they're doing is you used to be able to pirate pirate programs, you know, and for a college student or someone who's just starting out, you know,
[38:35.240 --> 38:39.240]  who can't pay $30,000 for a program like is it technically like a legal?
[38:39.240 --> 38:45.240]  Yeah, sure. But you know, it's a good way for someone who can't afford that to be able to get into that industry and get some practice.
[38:45.240 --> 38:54.240]  And now you can't even download a cracked file because they've gotten so deep into the coding to where the computer will recognize it, you know, and this could do a Photoshop or Illustrator.
[38:54.240 --> 39:06.240]  That's right. The that's what Matt Drudge was told by high level folks six, seven years ago when he came here and visited us was that it's all being engineered. And they now admit it into the software and not just the software of the
[39:06.240 --> 39:13.240]  software into the all the different interfaces and other devices where they're all communicating with each other.
[39:13.240 --> 39:19.240]  So what I think we should do to combat men is we have to at some point we have to kind of look like, you know, to building our own platform.
[39:19.240 --> 39:26.240]  But we need to we need to and this might sound a little, you know, I don't know, we just kind of need to steal it, you know, we need to steal it from them.
[39:26.240 --> 39:29.240]  They've already stolen so much from us, we need to take it in a way.
[39:29.240 --> 39:32.240]  Well, I mean, it's a form of civil disobedience to do it every afternoon.
[39:32.240 --> 39:34.240]  I've talked to a lot of engineers and software developers.
[39:34.240 --> 39:38.240]  I don't know all the details of it. I'm not a technical person, but I understand the movements.
[39:38.240 --> 39:49.240]  And what's happening that old tech particularly will be incredibly valuable in the future as people have to basically retreat back to that.
[39:49.240 --> 39:57.240]  But then there'll be such value in its communication systems and that it's not being censored that it'll make it worth its weight in platinum.
[39:57.240 --> 40:01.240]  Thank you so much, Jules. Let's go ahead and make another call.
[40:01.240 --> 40:09.240]  Let's talk to Randy in New Mexico. Go ahead, Randy.
[40:09.240 --> 40:11.240]  Alejandro, can you hear me?
[40:11.240 --> 40:12.240]  I sure can.
[40:12.240 --> 40:17.240]  Hey, man, glad to get on here and been listening for about 10 years. Appreciate you.
[40:17.240 --> 40:18.240]  Appreciate you.
[40:18.240 --> 40:33.240]  Hey, just was talking about, you know, thinking about these people, you just mentioned civil disobedience, you know, these coal-fired plants and these pipeline, you know, and I understand they're under public companies and boards and all that,
[40:33.240 --> 40:39.240]  but I think people just need to start doing what they do, flow the gas, run the coal plant.
[40:39.240 --> 40:43.240]  Let's just do what we do. They can't stop 300 million of us.
[40:43.240 --> 40:50.240]  They can get me, they can get you, they can get Owen, they can get a couple of guys here and there, but they're not going to stop everyone.
[40:50.240 --> 41:03.240]  And if everyone would just stick together, stop listening to the narrative, buying each other in brotherhood and sisterhood and just rock and roll, man, just do what you do and keep living your life.
[41:03.240 --> 41:06.240]  I agree, but that's why states like Texas are so important.
[41:06.240 --> 41:15.240]  Texas is one of the only states that's totally self-sufficient with water, with energy, with transportation, with ports and with railways.
[41:15.240 --> 41:20.240]  And that's why the Globals are targeting food and energy and infrastructure.
[41:20.240 --> 41:29.240]  They admit they are destroying the old system to consolidate control, not to make a better system, but to build a nightmare civilization.
[41:29.240 --> 41:37.240]  And there, you know, our governor here, I wasn't in the conversation, but I have heard that she told one of the power plants here in the state,
[41:37.240 --> 41:45.240]  do not do the rolling blackouts. They were supposed to shut down in May, and she told them, you keep going until after the election.
[41:45.240 --> 41:50.240]  So there's something up, you know, the election in November, she's up for election.
[41:50.240 --> 41:53.240]  Well, sir, what you heard through the grapevine is actually in the news.
[41:53.240 --> 42:03.240]  It's come out with elections in Europe and elections here. The Democrats have decided not to implement the whole green shutdown and new lockdowns that are planned till after the election.
[42:03.240 --> 42:08.240]  So what you heard from someone that overheard the governor is admitted.
[42:08.240 --> 42:13.240]  Yeah, and I just fear for what's going to happen. And that's why we need to just get ready.
[42:13.240 --> 42:19.240]  You know, you saw the video probably yesterday, the ATF or police over at the guy's house in Delaware.
[42:19.240 --> 42:23.240]  Yeah, I meant to get to that. In fact, as we print the article and load that video, we'll play it next segment.
[42:23.240 --> 42:28.240]  Yeah, ATF. Oh, you bought two guns. Well, we're here to just check on you because you bought two guns.
[42:28.240 --> 42:35.240]  They don't care about the border wide open, the coyotes, the mass murder, the human trafficking, all the doubling and tripling of honest homicides.
[42:35.240 --> 42:41.240]  They're not in the gangbanger areas. No, no, they're they're worried about legal, awful gun owners that buy guns.
[42:41.240 --> 42:43.240]  God bless you, Randy.
[42:43.240 --> 42:49.240]  We're going to go to break. We'll play that clip. I meant to get to that yesterday when we come back and we're going to go to sunny.
[42:49.240 --> 43:02.240]  And we're going to go to Chelsea and Parker and D and Warhay and Ben and John Doe and everybody sold out for seven months.
[43:02.240 --> 43:06.240]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula is back in stock.

[47:30.240 --> 47:37.240]  You know, I'm going to start the next hour on self defense and do part of a segment on it. I want to go right back to your calls right now that will continue on after I do this.
[47:37.240 --> 47:48.240]  But man receives warrantless ATF visit for purchasing more than two guns at a time. Gosh, I can't go to a gun store and not buy two or three guns. I just love them.
[47:48.240 --> 48:07.240]  They're amazing. How is that criminal and that ties in to all the gun grabbing announcements of gun banning that the Democrats are making. And then we also have that clip and I've lost the article. I had it right here. You guys pull that clip if you haven't already done it.
[48:07.240 --> 48:23.240]  I want to go back to your phone calls and the order they were received. Let's talk to D in Texas D. Go ahead.
[48:23.240 --> 48:25.240]  Yeah. Hey Alex.
[48:25.240 --> 48:26.240]  Welcome.
[48:26.240 --> 48:27.240]  God bless you.
[48:27.240 --> 48:39.240]  Anyways, I live in Texas here and I've been watching this high pressure dome sitting over us for what two months now. And maybe it'll move a little bit west but always seem to come back.
[48:39.240 --> 48:56.240]  And I don't I just think it's artificially manipulated you know with all the harp stuff they got going on and and you know then that that climate change hour came on and talk to you know start ticking off all the climate change problems that they're having.
[48:56.240 --> 49:08.240]  And she mentioned the heat dome over Texas. You know so it just I just want to bring that to mind and just let everybody know the question everything at this point because they got the technology to do all this.
[49:08.240 --> 49:19.240]  Well sir it's not your opinion that there's major weather modification going on the UN has treaties on it. The CIA director under Obama admitted they were doing it.
[49:19.240 --> 49:32.240]  They're able to weaponize with the Doppler radar which is really a harp array those systems. W E F World Economic Forum says block out the sun with space bubbles launched into orbit.
[49:32.240 --> 49:43.240]  They announced that two days ago and of course that's something Bill Gates has been pushing as well but I I totally agree with you but but here's the deal.
[49:43.240 --> 49:50.240]  They're able to make it not rain that's their biggest thing. One of these droughts are are are manmade.
[49:50.240 --> 49:57.240]  And they also cut off the water everywhere the Democrats and global turn control whether it's here Europe Australia are taking the cows away everything else.
[49:57.240 --> 50:06.240]  But. Texas is not the hottest it's ever been and the UK is not the hottest so they also lie and create that perception.
[50:06.240 --> 50:12.240]  Thanks for the call to great points. Chelsea in Florida you're on the air Chelsea.
[50:12.240 --> 50:14.240]  Hi Alex.
[50:14.240 --> 50:28.240]  I just want to tell you how much I love brain force and super female vitality. Every time I take it I can beat my fiance and chess and I'm really excited to try that.
[50:28.240 --> 50:30.240]  You got coming out. I ordered three bottles.
[50:30.240 --> 50:33.240]  Ready to get into conquer Christ shape for what's going down.
[50:33.240 --> 50:35.240]  Well thank you beautiful for doing that.
[50:35.240 --> 50:46.240]  You know I've lost almost 40 pounds taken diet force that came in the samples three months ago and it's a very good natural key concentrated compounds just like bodies is concentrated turmeric.
[50:46.240 --> 50:54.240]  This has a bunch of I'm not going to spend time on it but go to enforce where I come and look at the compounds we've got and know those are concentrates it really works.
[50:54.240 --> 50:59.240]  Yeah they're beautiful and we can definitely tell the product quality it's amazing.
[50:59.240 --> 51:14.240]  But I just say I hope they take out Biden and I hope this nation can kind of get that testosterone energy back and just say no and fight the Santas on it and just we got to pray that that happens like we need the revival.
[51:14.240 --> 51:23.240]  Well you see how they're trying to break everybody worldwide under the WF dictatorship and they say they're trying to break us to get control of us.
[51:23.240 --> 51:29.240]  Well as long as we expose they're the ones doing it all backfire on them and that's that's happening right now.
[51:29.240 --> 51:32.240]  And so we're at an extremely important crossroads you're right.
[51:32.240 --> 51:39.240]  Fighting back only makes us more free submitting only makes us more enslaved so there's really no choice.
[51:39.240 --> 51:41.240]  Yeah absolutely.
[51:41.240 --> 51:47.240]  And it's really sad like the normies really just are about to get the rug pulled under them.
[51:47.240 --> 51:54.240]  Like people my age I'm around 28 I'm like hey what would you do if you just wake up and couldn't get money out of the ATM.
[51:54.240 --> 51:58.240]  They look scared they don't even want to talk to me after that question.
[51:58.240 --> 52:07.240]  So people need to grow backbone and yep that's all I wanted to share the message pray to God and hope pray for the spiritual awakening.
[52:07.240 --> 52:09.240]  Thank you so much for the call.
[52:09.240 --> 52:11.240]  Let's go to Jorge in Wyoming.
[52:11.240 --> 52:13.240]  Jorge welcome.
[52:13.240 --> 52:20.240]  Well Alex before I get to Joe Biden and energy for those in Texas who are interested in weather modification.
[52:20.240 --> 52:30.240]  You can look up the West Texas Weather Modification Association along with the South Texas Weather Modifications Association.
[52:30.240 --> 52:38.240]  They sell it as a cloud seeding to produce more rain but as you just talked about as other callers over the years other guests have talked about.
[52:38.240 --> 52:45.240]  It's really more drought inducing type of conditions which is happening all over the Southwest including here in Wyoming.
[52:45.240 --> 52:52.240]  Now if you would have wore game this properly Alejandro you would have wore game this correctly.
[52:52.240 --> 52:58.240]  It would have been the neoconservatives in charge of this takeover.
[52:58.240 --> 53:07.240]  What I mean you have Antifa a couple of years ago attacking burning down setting on fire buildings in Portland federal courthouses correct.
[53:07.240 --> 53:10.240]  You have the summer of rage last year.
[53:10.240 --> 53:20.240]  It would have been easier to sell to the public similar to 9 11 those types of actions to try to put forth this.
[53:20.240 --> 53:23.240]  This is a world economic forum type of future.
[53:23.240 --> 53:36.240]  Instead you have you have incompetent leaders really moving this forward which is awakening people at a quicker and quicker rate at a rate they probably weren't expecting.
[53:36.240 --> 53:42.240]  So they didn't wore game this correctly and I'm fearful that they're going to like a terrible gambler.
[53:42.240 --> 53:50.240]  They're going to double they're going to triple they're going to chase until all hell breaks.
[53:50.240 --> 53:57.240]  I totally agree with you because they think that they are immune because the public so stupid and the public's not stupid.
[53:57.240 --> 54:05.240]  They're ill informed and that's why they want broadcast like this off the air because if we can identify this is part of a master plan and show where they admitted its game over for them.
[54:05.240 --> 54:07.240]  Thank you so much sir.
[54:07.240 --> 54:08.240]  All right.
[54:08.240 --> 54:09.240]  Let's take another caller.
[54:09.240 --> 54:13.240]  Let's talk to sunny in North Carolina.
[54:13.240 --> 54:14.240]  Alex.
[54:14.240 --> 54:16.240]  Yes, I'm sick with you.
[54:16.240 --> 54:17.240]  Honor.
[54:17.240 --> 54:24.240]  I just want to point out real quick to all the vaccine injured veterans as a veteran myself.
[54:24.240 --> 54:28.240]  I didn't take vaccine by experience the coercion that they use.
[54:28.240 --> 54:35.240]  They can file a claim for compensation under title 38 usc 1151.
[54:35.240 --> 54:38.240]  If we get enough claims we can release that data out.
[54:38.240 --> 54:52.240]  So they need to go ahead and file and by the way it was people complaining in the military that stopped the last two rounds of anthrac shots that the government admits killed 23,000 troops and the troops being tested on with a beta test for us and the deadly covid shot.
[54:52.240 --> 54:58.240]  Yes, sir, we need them to file it. We need them to file a claim under title 38 usc 1151.
[54:58.240 --> 55:01.240]  And I also like to shout out feds for medical freedom.
[55:01.240 --> 55:04.240]  Very few federal employees fighting for medical freedom.
[55:04.240 --> 55:06.240]  And that's it.
[55:06.240 --> 55:08.240]  It's all I wanted to do on thank you.
[55:08.240 --> 55:09.240]  Thank you for everything.
[55:09.240 --> 55:10.240]  Alex.
[55:10.240 --> 55:11.240]  Thank you, brother.
[55:11.240 --> 55:12.240]  I'm trying hard.
[55:12.240 --> 55:13.240]  I really appreciate you and God bless you.
[55:13.240 --> 55:14.240]  Sonny.
[55:14.240 --> 55:15.240]  Thanks for calling and holding.
[55:15.240 --> 55:16.240]  All right.
[55:16.240 --> 55:18.240]  I got to tell you we've turned the corner here in the last few months when I take calls.
[55:18.240 --> 55:20.240]  I'm actually getting a lot of calls.
[55:20.240 --> 55:23.240]  But he mentioned the vaccine news.
[55:23.240 --> 55:24.240]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[55:24.240 --> 55:25.240]  I've got to hit this.
[55:25.240 --> 55:30.240]  I've got to hit the self defense issues and Congress and men are coming to confiscate the guns.
[55:30.240 --> 55:31.240]  It's not just back to a rort saying it.
[55:31.240 --> 55:33.240]  So that's coming up.
[55:33.240 --> 55:45.240]  But let me talk about something really important here for your own life and for our operation as well.
[55:45.240 --> 55:51.240]  We have a big special running right now that is only going to run for two weeks.
[55:51.240 --> 55:59.240]  And that is the complete toothpaste line of high quality organic essential oil infused fluoride free toothpaste.
[55:59.240 --> 56:11.240]  All three of the great brands we have all three of the great formulas for 50% off together or 40% off individually.
[56:11.240 --> 56:19.240]  In the case of the activated charcoal toothpaste in the case of the super silver tooth whitening toothpaste.
[56:19.240 --> 56:23.240]  Super coral calcium toothpaste that is just amazing.
[56:23.240 --> 56:25.240]  But everybody wanted it.
[56:25.240 --> 56:26.240]  And it's back.
[56:26.240 --> 56:33.240]  The original super blue toothpaste limited run at info or store.com.
[56:33.240 --> 56:36.240]  And while you're there, please get an Alex Jones's right T shirt.
[56:36.240 --> 56:41.240]  Help fund the operation. That is a fundraiser shirt, but the designer one and the regular one, they're both excellent.
[56:41.240 --> 56:44.240]  And while you're there, get bodies, ultimate tumor formula.
[56:44.240 --> 56:51.240]  And of course, while you're there, get the new diet force X seven product that is all these natural concentrates to raise.
[56:51.240 --> 57:00.240]  Not just your metabolic rate, not just your system, but also your immune system as well.
[57:00.240 --> 57:09.240]  But as we age, our metabolism slow down and the natural healthy compounds and diet force help turn that up and accelerate in a healthy way.
[57:09.240 --> 57:11.240]  It's a very popular product out of the gates.
[57:11.240 --> 57:14.240]  Can't wait to hear your reviews because I know I've lost 39 pounds.
[57:14.240 --> 57:17.240]  I haven't waited about a week, probably more now, still too big.
[57:17.240 --> 57:21.240]  But diet force was the deciding factor the last three months because we had samples in of it.
[57:21.240 --> 57:29.240]  So diet force also available, but all three of the toothpaste 50% off or individually 40% off info or store.
[57:29.240 --> 57:34.240]  Dot com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[57:34.240 --> 57:37.240]  I want to thank you all for keeping us on air with your funding.
[57:37.240 --> 57:42.240]  We are fighting the globalist at point like range and have reached the critical part of our mission.
[57:42.240 --> 57:50.240]  Also, the new film is on pre-sale Alex's war info or store.com.
[57:50.240 --> 57:58.240]  The globalist are doing everything they can to destroy heterosexual relationships to annihilate the family to split up marriages.
[57:58.240 --> 58:07.240]  And if you look at the studies, the number one cause of marriages breaking up is the fact that the men cannot satisfy their women in the bedroom.
[58:07.240 --> 58:09.240]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen.
[58:09.240 --> 58:15.240]  And even if you're like me and hardly ever have a problem, I mean, all of us, one point, another two, that's just the truth.
[58:15.240 --> 58:17.240]  The liberals will make fun of that, but everybody knows that's true.

[59:40.240 --> 59:47.240]  Made America, powered by God's great creation, it is amazing, and it funds the infowar.
[59:51.240 --> 59:58.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:01.240 --> 1:00:05.240]  $14 billion, that is just about exhausted.
[1:00:05.240 --> 1:00:09.240]  In fact, we started our assistance to Ukraine before this war began.
[1:00:09.240 --> 1:00:18.240]  In Ukraine, more security systems last year, $650 million in weapons, including anti-air and anti-armor equipment, before the invasion.
[1:00:18.240 --> 1:00:21.240]  More than we had ever provided before.
[1:00:21.240 --> 1:00:28.240]  And once the war started, we immediately rushed $350 million in additional aid to further address their needs.
[1:00:28.240 --> 1:00:36.240]  On Saturday, my administration always another $200 million to keep a steady flow of weapons and ammunition moving to Ukraine.
[1:00:36.240 --> 1:00:46.240]  I'm especially pleased to be able to announce today that the United States will provide an additional $1 billion security assistance package for Ukraine.
[1:00:46.240 --> 1:00:51.240]  Democrats demand $650 billion.
[1:00:51.240 --> 1:00:59.240]  See how it escalates? It's 60-something billion now, and now it's going to be $650 billion? Why not?
[1:00:59.240 --> 1:01:09.240]  And then you've got Mitt Romney and Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden, and all these people, Republican Democrat leaders, who are warmongers, the neocons,
[1:01:09.240 --> 1:01:18.240]  whose families run the damn companies, the media, the energy, the transportation, the shipyards, everything.
[1:01:18.240 --> 1:01:29.240]  The looting is incredible, and again, they're inflating the currency, but they buy up real stuff as it's inflated, then they pass us the debt and the devaluation.
[1:01:29.240 --> 1:01:40.240]  I mean, wow, that is a whopper. This is extremely, extremely dangerous situation that we are in right now.
[1:01:40.240 --> 1:01:47.240]  The good news is, all over the world, people are identifying the globalist plan to collapse the economy by design in their own statements.
[1:01:47.240 --> 1:01:53.240]  What can we do together to avert a global food catastrophe?
[1:01:53.240 --> 1:02:05.240]  To start, we have to understand the forces that have led us to this current precipice, the most existential of which is climate change.
[1:02:05.240 --> 1:02:12.240]  And the fact that they have put their politicians and controllers in, in every major government, except for Communist China and Russia.
[1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:25.240]  What we are very proud of now is the young generation, like Prime Minister Trudeau, President of Argentina and so on, so that we penetrate the cabinets.
[1:02:25.240 --> 1:02:33.240]  Klaus Schwab, the New World Order, bragged that they have control of half of the parliaments, half of the cabinets, and governments of the world,
[1:02:33.240 --> 1:02:40.240]  and that they're getting control of another 30-40%. They are close to having 80-90% control over governments in the world,
[1:02:40.240 --> 1:02:53.240]  and they brag they are the corporate global governance. We are making you sell your farms and taking your cows. How dare you riot in the Netherlands?
[1:02:53.240 --> 1:03:00.240]  Well, Dutch farmers now are getting angry every day more. Government is not listening.
[1:03:00.240 --> 1:03:11.240]  And what we are fearing for is we have to leave our land. And that's also a deeper agenda behind it. In Holland, they just want to have farmer's land.
[1:03:11.240 --> 1:03:22.240]  62% of the area in Holland is found by farmers. And what they want to do is they want to have the land cheap, so they're making it major first.
[1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:34.240]  And when they have the land in their hands, they can build houses on it. Houses we don't need by Dutch citizens, because average Dutch couple is getting 1.8, 1.9 kids.
[1:03:34.240 --> 1:03:45.240]  So what's the problem of the demand for houses that we get 100,000 refugees in this country every year? That's why they have to build houses.
[1:03:45.240 --> 1:03:55.240]  So you decide, ladies and gentlemen, do you want to roll over to this or do you want to get involved? But now is the time to realize, we're entering the 12th round right now.
[1:04:16.240 --> 1:04:25.240]  If you don't watch it, you're going to end up like Jason Adderley's boy. Deal me out this hand, Jason. I'm about to bust.
[1:04:25.240 --> 1:04:47.240]  Oh, I'm sorry. I thought this was the bathroom. Oh, good lord.
[1:04:47.240 --> 1:04:58.240]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones. Your calls are 60 seconds out. Stand by.
[1:05:19.240 --> 1:05:27.240]  We have the strongest brand on earth. Nobody else decided to do it. It's 95% humanoid at infowarstore.com.

[1:05:38.240 --> 1:05:48.240]  So the only way you fail is not taking action today and ordering body's ultimate turmeric formula at infowarstore.com. It is simply amazing.

[1:06:10.240 --> 1:06:17.240]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[1:06:17.240 --> 1:06:24.240]  Loveless puppet leaders of the New World Order, W.E.F. Takeover, are resigning all over the world.
[1:06:24.240 --> 1:06:32.240]  And now the knives are out for Joe Biden to bring in Kamala Harris and then Michael Obama or Gavin Newsom.
[1:06:32.240 --> 1:06:36.240]  We're taking your phone calls on that subject here in the shower.
[1:06:36.240 --> 1:06:48.240]  But right now, I want to hit this story before we go to your calls. This whole group of stories that tie together. This is an article up on infowarstore.com that has a condensed group of videos.
[1:06:48.240 --> 1:06:58.240]  It's over an hour long total of the Democrat leadership admitting that, yeah, what we're doing is going to ban and confiscate a lot of your guns.
[1:06:58.240 --> 1:07:05.240]  Jim's openly admit gun control bill will confiscate firearms in, quote, common use. That ties into this next video.
[1:07:05.240 --> 1:07:11.240]  Man receives warrantless ATF visit for purchasing more than two guns at a time.
[1:07:11.240 --> 1:07:14.240]  And the list goes on and on.
[1:07:14.240 --> 1:07:16.240]  U.S. man saves five kids from fire.
[1:07:16.240 --> 1:07:19.240]  Netizens support him on GoFundMe.
[1:07:19.240 --> 1:07:22.240]  The fire department and police just stood there.
[1:07:22.240 --> 1:07:28.240]  But that's an example of what we're talking about. You know, I didn't play the video a few days ago. I should have.
[1:07:28.240 --> 1:07:35.240]  But it was a man collapses at the convenience store behind the counter.
[1:07:35.240 --> 1:07:40.240]  So everybody starts climbing over and robbing the place because he's collapsed.
[1:07:40.240 --> 1:07:43.240]  It's just no caring about our fellow humans.
[1:07:43.240 --> 1:07:46.240]  Politicians have protection. They have armed guards.
[1:07:46.240 --> 1:07:55.240]  They don't want us to have our own bodies to be able to guard ourselves. And they're demonizing the man.
[1:07:55.240 --> 1:08:03.240]  At the latest mass shooting where he was only able to kill two people because a man with a gun at the grocery store shot him and stopped him.
[1:08:03.240 --> 1:08:08.240]  They're demonizing the man that did that.
[1:08:08.240 --> 1:08:17.240]  They're talking about a presidential ticket of Kyle Rittenhouse and this latest individual.
[1:08:17.240 --> 1:08:21.240]  I'd love to get on the show, by the way, who tried to get him on.
[1:08:21.240 --> 1:08:30.240]  But here is just a few clips from the article we mentioned with Democrat leaders, Nadler and others saying the quiet part out loud.
[1:08:30.240 --> 1:08:40.240]  The Assault Weapons Ban Act would prohibit the sale, manufacture, transfer or possession of semi-automatic assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices.
[1:08:40.240 --> 1:08:51.240]  At the same time, grandfather's existing semi-automatic assault weapons and contains numerous protections for law enforcement and responsible gun owners,
[1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:57.240]  such as hunters, gun collectors, farmers, sports shooters, and those who use firearms for self-defense.
[1:08:57.240 --> 1:09:04.240]  We will undoubtedly hear a variety of arguments from our Republican friends opposed to taking these deadly weapons off our streets.
[1:09:04.240 --> 1:09:11.240]  But it is important to consider today's debate in the context of our other efforts to address the violence plaguing our communities.
[1:09:11.240 --> 1:09:23.240]  Time and again, Democrats have advanced responsible gun safety legislation only to face Republican opposition marching in lockstep with the extreme agenda of the gun industry.
[1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:30.240]  I now recognize the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Jordan, for his opening statement.
[1:09:30.240 --> 1:09:36.240]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think in your opening statement you used the phrase Republicans opposed it, I think seven times if I counted accurately.
[1:09:36.240 --> 1:09:42.240]  The reason we opposed it is because all those pieces of legislation were a direct violation of the Second Amendment.
[1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:47.240]  The right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[1:09:47.240 --> 1:09:56.240]  Plain and simple. It doesn't say the right to keep and bear muskets shall not be infringed. It doesn't say shall not be infringed unless Democrats say this weapon looks so scary we have to get rid of it.
[1:09:56.240 --> 1:10:01.240]  It doesn't say that at all. It says shall not be infringed.
[1:10:01.240 --> 1:10:10.240]  We said this in the last markup on legislation where the Democrats were trying to infringe on Americans, law abiding American Second Amendment liberties.
[1:10:10.240 --> 1:10:15.240]  We said the Democrats' beef is with the Second Amendment. If you want to get rid of the Second Amendment, go try a constitutional amendment.
[1:10:15.240 --> 1:10:19.240]  How far do you get with that? But instead, no, you come with these pieces of legislation.
[1:10:19.240 --> 1:10:26.240]  If this legislation becomes law, millions, millions of firearms that Americans legally own today will be illegal.
[1:10:26.240 --> 1:10:38.240]  Under this bill, if you give one of those legally owned firearms to a family member or a friend or a neighbor, you could end up in federal prison for five years if you don't go through an FFL for a background check.
[1:10:38.240 --> 1:10:53.240]  Elijah Dickens is the man at the mall after the crazed lunatic shot two people reportedly planning to shoot more. He shot him with 8 out of 10 shots at 40 plus feet away.
[1:10:53.240 --> 1:11:02.240]  22-year-old Elijah Dickens neutralized mass shooter 15 seconds into the attack. It's not guns, it's bad people.
[1:11:02.240 --> 1:11:08.240]  Bad people with guns versus good people with guns. That cliche is absolutely true.
[1:11:08.240 --> 1:11:17.240]  Here is a clip of the man receives warrantless ATF visit for purchasing more than two guns at a time in Delaware. Here it is.
[1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:32.240]  All I'm doing is verifying that you have it. You've got two different purchases. If you have them, I'm out of here. That's how quick it is.
[1:11:32.240 --> 1:11:48.240]  Do you remember bringing them out or you can go out to your foyer here and check them out by number and we're out of here?
[1:11:48.240 --> 1:12:03.240]  One of the indicators that we get is that somebody makes a large gun purchase and then a lot of times we've been there like, oh those guns got took in.
[1:12:03.240 --> 1:12:14.240]  He comes to us and we have to check him out. That's all that is. He did nothing wrong. It's absolutely zero. I noticed that you were stopped in Philly though, right?
[1:12:14.240 --> 1:12:32.240]  So I was at a gun shop six months ago at a range, the range in Austin, great folks, and I was buying a deer rifle and I just couldn't help myself when I bought a handgun and a shotgun.
[1:12:32.240 --> 1:12:50.240]  And when I was doing the background check, it kept stopping me with all these names of different people. And the same thing happened a year ago when I was at Cabela's buying shotguns, bird hunting shotguns.
[1:12:50.240 --> 1:13:02.240]  And it did the same thing where it said, well, do you know this Jones or that Jones? Are you buying the gun for this person? No, I'm buying them for me. But the point is that's these databases.
[1:13:02.240 --> 1:13:10.240]  That's how this works. And now they're adding the whole red flag situation to it. They don't want the dickens of the world out there stopping criminals.
[1:13:10.240 --> 1:13:21.240]  Here's a video out of Lafayette, Indiana. Man saves five kids from fire. That isn't support him on GoFundMe. He runs in and saves multiple kids. There's another upstairs in the burning house.
[1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:33.240]  He runs up in the house and jumps out the window with the child. Now compare this video we're about to air to and I've now watched the hour plus video. It's so shameful.
[1:13:33.240 --> 1:13:51.240]  You can't believe it. They've released the surveillance footage from Uvaldi inside the school where the police sit around and scratch their butts, talk on their phones, use hand sanitizer.
[1:13:51.240 --> 1:13:59.240]  They're all wearing gloves and mask. What a pathetic group of people. These are bureaucrats, not police officers, not warriors, not defenders.
[1:13:59.240 --> 1:14:05.240]  But here is a warrior, here's a patriot, willing to lay down his life for others. We salute this person. Here it is.
[1:14:05.240 --> 1:14:13.240]  That car right there, somebody pulled in to let him know their house is on fire. I saw him around back.
[1:14:13.240 --> 1:14:19.240]  Hey guys, six-year-old girl in a twenty-three-year-old male in the house somewhere.
[1:14:19.240 --> 1:14:27.240]  What do you got? Six-year-old female in a twenty-three-year-old male possibly inside.
[1:14:27.240 --> 1:14:32.240]  So for radio listeners, the house looks like a Roman candle. It's engulfed in flame.
[1:14:32.240 --> 1:14:34.240]  Guys, come here, come here.
[1:14:34.240 --> 1:14:42.240]  And a citizen goes in and saves multiple children while the fire department assesses the situation instead of going in.
[1:14:42.240 --> 1:14:47.240]  And then the citizen runs back in and saves another child.
[1:14:47.240 --> 1:14:50.240]  And then runs back in and goes in and saves more.
[1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:58.240]  Come with me, man, come with me. That's the type of men we need.
[1:14:58.240 --> 1:15:06.240]  That rush towards the danger, not away from it. And then evil won't have a place in this country or this world.
[1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:11.240]  I'm surprised they didn't, firefighters are great on average, but I'm surprised they didn't arrest him.
[1:15:11.240 --> 1:15:20.240]  George Soros ran that town, they would. You took an initiative, you went and saved three, four children?
[1:15:20.240 --> 1:15:25.240]  It's a piece of delivery guy, saves five kids, he must have three. The number is so insane.
[1:15:25.240 --> 1:15:29.240]  From burning house, the house is completely engulfed in flame.
[1:15:29.240 --> 1:15:34.240]  He goes and saves four, one is stuck upstairs, God knows where the parents are.
[1:15:34.240 --> 1:15:39.240]  And he jumps out the window with the four-year-old.
[1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:43.240]  And we're waiting for the left to attack him like they did.
[1:15:43.240 --> 1:15:53.240]  Dickens is Nick Bostick doing his job.
[1:15:53.240 --> 1:15:58.240]  He should be the police chief of the fire chief, not a pizza delivery man.
[1:15:58.240 --> 1:16:08.240]  The globalists are doing everything they can to destroy heterosexual relationships, to annihilate the family, to split up marriages.
[1:16:08.240 --> 1:16:17.240]  If you look at the studies, the number one cause of marriages breaking up is the fact that the men cannot satisfy their women in the bedroom.
[1:16:17.240 --> 1:16:25.240]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen. And even if you're like me and hardly ever have a problem, I mean, all of us, one for another, two, that's just the truth.
[1:16:25.240 --> 1:16:27.240]  The liberals will make fun of that, but everybody knows that's true.

[1:19:58.240 --> 1:20:09.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:09.240 --> 1:20:31.240]  Lord, I can't change. I can't support pedophilia. I can't eat the bugs. I can't worship the devil.
[1:20:31.240 --> 1:20:40.240]  I can't say men can have babies. I can't say that Biden's my president. I'm gonna fly.
[1:20:40.240 --> 1:20:47.240]  Fly a free bird. And I've experienced the power of humanity. I've experienced the power of the individual.
[1:20:47.240 --> 1:20:53.240]  I've experienced God's will and destiny in 28 years on air. We've changed the world together.
[1:20:53.240 --> 1:21:01.240]  We've done incredible things. Those roughest things are, remember, God's in control.
[1:21:01.240 --> 1:21:08.240]  And things only get worse when we submit to Satan. They only get better when we call Jesus into the game.
[1:21:08.240 --> 1:21:15.240]  They say, God, I'm weak. I'm a sinner, but I'm reaching out to you. I'm asking you to take my hand and lead God to direct me.
[1:21:15.240 --> 1:21:20.240]  You're gonna feel that hand come right in there and grab yours. And then it all changes.
[1:21:20.240 --> 1:21:25.240]  I've got to follow the directives. I'm telling myself that. I point my fingers at you.
[1:21:25.240 --> 1:21:30.240]  All those others are pointing right back at me.
[1:21:30.240 --> 1:21:35.240]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, taking your phone calls right now.
[1:21:35.240 --> 1:21:43.240]  So many different topics to cover. The Evaldi shooting and the gun grab with John Doe we're gonna go to in a moment.
[1:21:43.240 --> 1:21:50.240]  We got Ben in Oregon on health infrastructure for legal immigrants bankrupt the country. We got so many calls here. Let's go to him.
[1:21:50.240 --> 1:21:56.240]  Let's talk to a caller in Florida. Let's talk to John Doe. You're on the air.
[1:21:56.240 --> 1:21:58.240]  Hey, Alex, big fan over here, man.
[1:21:58.240 --> 1:22:00.240]  God bless you.
[1:22:00.240 --> 1:22:08.240]  I got a, I have a little thing that I noticed that I'd like to share with you and your and your, and your, your followers.
[1:22:08.240 --> 1:22:18.240]  I'd like you all to go on to YouTube and look up retired SWAT officer weighs in on Evaldi video. His name is Jared Reston.
[1:22:18.240 --> 1:22:27.240]  And if you look closely at him, you'll notice that this is the same actor who played Stephen Paddock's brother,
[1:22:27.240 --> 1:22:35.240]  AKA Eric Paddock during the Vegas shooting. And this is a, I don't know if it's like a deep state mix up or,
[1:22:35.240 --> 1:22:45.240]  I don't know what it is, but he looks very, very similar. And I would like everyone to check it out and see for themselves.
[1:22:45.240 --> 1:22:52.240]  All right, you want to talk about the Evaldi shooting. You know, here's the deal, brother. A lot of folks think I'm Bill Hicks,
[1:22:52.240 --> 1:23:00.240]  because out of the fact that I have dirty blonde hair and he had dark brown hair, we looked somewhat alike. I guess Hicks is Welsh.
[1:23:00.240 --> 1:23:07.240]  Jones is Welsh. Yeah, I've been to the Welsh areas of England. It's surprising how many people look like me.
[1:23:07.240 --> 1:23:15.240]  I guess those genetics are very expressive, but I look like my dad and he looks like his ancestors and people think I'm Bill Hicks.
[1:23:15.240 --> 1:23:23.240]  And I mean, I just don't know who this person is. I don't know where specifically getting at. They just put him on screen.
[1:23:23.240 --> 1:23:35.240]  I think they did. But I know this. The police did stand down for 77 minutes. And that alone is why we should have guns.
[1:23:35.240 --> 1:23:41.240]  An example of how corrupt these systems are. Now they've advertised the public schools as crazy person, shoot them up zones.
[1:23:41.240 --> 1:23:44.240]  What else do you think about the Evaldi shooting?
[1:23:44.240 --> 1:23:53.240]  I honestly think that it's all bullshit. I think that if you look at these videos and a lot of Sandy Hook, and I know you got some flak, you got some shit for it.
[1:23:53.240 --> 1:23:59.240]  You just close class. I got to let you go, brother. Listen, we're on over 400 radio stations. We can't have cussing.
[1:23:59.240 --> 1:24:04.240]  One time I can do, we got to delay it. The next time you do, we got to let you go. Okay, I appreciate your call.
[1:24:04.240 --> 1:24:08.240]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Ben in Oregon. Ben, you're on the air. Welcome.
[1:24:08.240 --> 1:24:15.240]  Hi, Alex. First time call, a long time listener. I just wanted to call on the Oregon Free Health Insurance for illegals.
[1:24:15.240 --> 1:24:22.240]  I just got a memo in the email the other day. I'm an insurance agent here, been working insurance for a while.
[1:24:22.240 --> 1:24:28.240]  Yeah, they're giving illegals free health insurance that just started this month here in Oregon.
[1:24:28.240 --> 1:24:38.240]  Also, I wanted to mention the Obamacare, of course. It's like doubled the prices of everything and troubled it since I've been working on this.
[1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:46.240]  And recently, they actually made the Obamacare special enrollment period for gay people and transgender and everything as well.
[1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:54.240]  And remember, Obama said it would lower your insurance rate to the cost of a phone or cable bill.
[1:24:54.240 --> 1:25:00.240]  Oh, yeah, that's a big lie. Also, I wanted to mention on the gun violence, you were talking about the Second Amendment bill.
[1:25:00.240 --> 1:25:07.240]  I mean, here in Oregon, they have initiative 17. They're trying to get through and they're having pastors push this thing, trying to take her guns.
[1:25:07.240 --> 1:25:16.240]  I couldn't believe it. Oh, yeah, that's the clergy response teams to the big Rockefeller organizations, the World Council of Churches,
[1:25:16.240 --> 1:25:23.240]  the Ecumenical Movement. They have most of the churches on board with the transgenderism, the open borders, the gun control, all of it.
[1:25:23.240 --> 1:25:28.240]  Yeah, that's an article on K2.com here in Oregon. You can check that out.
[1:25:28.240 --> 1:25:30.240]  What's the headline on it?
[1:25:30.240 --> 1:25:35.240]  Let me check real quick. It's Oregon voters to decide gun control measure.
[1:25:35.240 --> 1:25:39.240]  All right. Thank you so much, Ben. Thanks for calling. Really appreciate you.
[1:25:39.240 --> 1:25:45.240]  All right, let's take another caller from Parker in Iowa. Parker, you're on the air.
[1:25:45.240 --> 1:25:47.240]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[1:25:47.240 --> 1:25:48.240]  Yes, sir.
[1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:56.240]  I'm a longtime listener, first-time caller. I reside in Iowa. I'm 17 years old. I work for a retail chain. We sell everything.
[1:25:56.240 --> 1:26:03.240]  Over the last four months of me working there, I've noticed people showing up, you know, illegal immigrants. They come in.
[1:26:03.240 --> 1:26:12.240]  They have little kids speak for them. They just, they treat me like I'm honestly a human garbage can. They're very entitled.
[1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:19.240]  They, they can't speak English and they come in with big wads of cash and every time I see them, they're in the exact same clothes.
[1:26:19.240 --> 1:26:23.240]  They drive really nice cars and it's just really sad to watch our country.
[1:26:23.240 --> 1:26:36.240]  Yeah, it's called the cartels. And you know, they've got warehouses of enslaved illegals that they're milking and enslaving and controlling with the Democrats placing them for pedophilia, sex trafficking, slave labor, sweatshops.
[1:26:36.240 --> 1:26:39.240]  I mean, this is really evil.
[1:26:39.240 --> 1:26:45.240]  It's like, I'll be nice and liberal. Let all the people in know they're being let in to be oppressed.
[1:26:45.240 --> 1:26:50.240]  I'll assure you, 9% of the people that are porn across that border are desperate and are slaves.
[1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:58.240]  But the ones you're seeing are cartel members or MS 13 or operatives or God's children, as Pelosi called them.
[1:26:58.240 --> 1:27:05.240]  I told her agree with you, Alex. They come in. They, they really do treat me like I'm human garbage.
[1:27:05.240 --> 1:27:10.240]  They, they don't, they don't talk nice. They yell at their kids.
[1:27:10.240 --> 1:27:14.240]  I watched one older gentleman slap his kid upside the head because he said something wrong.
[1:27:14.240 --> 1:27:18.240]  They abuse their children and I honestly don't think that they are their children.
[1:27:18.240 --> 1:27:19.240]  I told her.
[1:27:19.240 --> 1:27:24.240]  Well, I tried to know their kidnap the children as they're, as they're going to jail, free card. That's on record.
[1:27:24.240 --> 1:27:27.240]  Very true. Very true.
[1:27:27.240 --> 1:27:39.240]  I had, I, when COVID first started, I was going, they offered me to go into virtual campus and I chose it because I've never really enjoyed the high school with all the shootings.
[1:27:39.240 --> 1:27:44.240]  And I went into it and they come to my house to check on me every so often.
[1:27:44.240 --> 1:27:50.240]  They came to me in October of last year and offered me the vaccine without my mother's knowledge.
[1:27:50.240 --> 1:27:51.240]  Totally against her wishes.
[1:27:51.240 --> 1:27:57.240]  Jerry told him I didn't want it and they tried to manipulate me into getting it.
[1:27:57.240 --> 1:28:00.240]  Amazing, sir. God bless you. And I appreciate your call, Parker. All right.
[1:28:00.240 --> 1:28:04.240]  We're going to take more calls when we come back. Jim and others get ready.
[1:28:04.240 --> 1:28:12.240]  And then suddenly mainstream media all over the news says, serotonin, reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs don't work.
[1:28:12.240 --> 1:28:17.240]  Wow. Talk about more coins in the Patriots for right jar.
[1:28:17.240 --> 1:28:27.240]  That's all coming up and we're going to get more into what I haven't covered yet, the incredible developments on the poison shot front and the new lockdowns that are coming.

[1:30:16.240 --> 1:30:18.240]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen.

[1:31:05.240 --> 1:31:09.240]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles. You see it every year.
[1:31:09.240 --> 1:31:14.240]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[1:31:14.240 --> 1:31:21.240]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system
[1:31:21.240 --> 1:31:24.240]  and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this.
[1:31:24.240 --> 1:31:29.240]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody.

[1:33:25.240 --> 1:33:32.240]  It's being announced all over the world. Governments outlawing most of the farming that's going on
[1:33:32.240 --> 1:33:36.240]  and offering to buy up the land and sell it to multinational corporations.
[1:33:36.240 --> 1:33:42.240]  The UK government, UK government openly has put out a press release, gov.uk,
[1:33:42.240 --> 1:33:46.240]  how to apply for a loan sum payment to leave or retire from farming.
[1:33:46.240 --> 1:33:49.240]  It's all coming up here today.
[1:33:49.240 --> 1:33:52.240]  Next segment, I'll get to the serotonin riptick inhibitors they admit don't work
[1:33:52.240 --> 1:33:57.240]  and the poison shots and the latest developments that are so huge, the new lockdowns they're announcing.
[1:33:57.240 --> 1:34:03.240]  But right now, let's just go through a bunch of your calls. These are really amazing points, amazing callers that are coming into the show.
[1:34:03.240 --> 1:34:07.240]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jim in Michigan with the gun grab.
[1:34:07.240 --> 1:34:13.240]  Yeah, it's associated press admits it'll ban semi-autos. Democrats admit it'll ban most guns.
[1:34:13.240 --> 1:34:17.240]  Wow, they are really, really pushing it, aren't they?
[1:34:17.240 --> 1:34:22.240]  Well, you know, Alex, I think it's all involved with taking farmers land.
[1:34:22.240 --> 1:34:27.240]  It's going to start in Europe and then it's going to come here. And I'll tell you what, Michigan is a farming state.
[1:34:27.240 --> 1:34:32.240]  We go out, we deer hunt, we fish. You know, it ain't going to go over as easy as it can.
[1:34:32.240 --> 1:34:35.240]  And it's a gorgeous state. It's so gorgeous.
[1:34:35.240 --> 1:34:39.240]  Yeah, a lot of the elitist up in Traverse City on Lake Michigan.
[1:34:39.240 --> 1:34:44.240]  Kind of like the Riviera of the Midwest up there. You know, beautiful.
[1:34:44.240 --> 1:34:52.240]  But anyways, you know, the gun debate, I mean, it all just goes down to 1776.
[1:34:52.240 --> 1:34:55.240]  We'll commence again if you try and take our firearms, okay?
[1:34:55.240 --> 1:34:58.240]  I mean, that's just as simple as that, you know.
[1:34:58.240 --> 1:35:06.240]  I just wish the elite would take their billions and take their fiat currency and take their little money
[1:35:06.240 --> 1:35:11.240]  and their, you know, screwed up ideas and just get an island somewhere and get out of my face.
[1:35:11.240 --> 1:35:16.240]  Because your odds are about $7 billion to one. Okay?
[1:35:16.240 --> 1:35:23.240]  If humanity pushed up against you, you elitists, your odds are $7 billion to one.
[1:35:23.240 --> 1:35:27.240]  And we have to get lucky one time. You have to get lucky every time.
[1:35:27.240 --> 1:35:29.240]  You know what I'm saying?
[1:35:29.240 --> 1:35:33.240]  I agree with you, but they've got a lot of Ravada, a lot of Hutzpah.
[1:35:33.240 --> 1:35:36.240]  How do you see all this unfolding?
[1:35:36.240 --> 1:35:44.240]  Well, they're going to have, before they kick Biden out, they're going to have him sign some kind of crazy gun ban law, you know.
[1:35:44.240 --> 1:35:50.240]  Oh, they're going to have him sign everything, martial law bills, gun confiscation, energy shutdowns.
[1:35:50.240 --> 1:35:53.240]  It's all being announced. It's not like it's our speculation now.
[1:35:53.240 --> 1:35:57.240]  Yeah, well, good luck getting my guns because, alright, we know what's going on.
[1:35:57.240 --> 1:35:59.240]  We know who you are.
[1:35:59.240 --> 1:36:02.240]  And when the guy comes up and knocks on my door, you know, I might give him all my guns.
[1:36:02.240 --> 1:36:11.240]  I might have one buried away somewhere, but that next day, I'm not going to go after the guy that, you know, had the kids at home just doing it, just to survive.
[1:36:11.240 --> 1:36:17.240]  You know, if this was Minecraft, if I was playing a game of Minecraft, I'd go after the head of the snake.
[1:36:17.240 --> 1:36:19.240]  And that's what's going to happen.
[1:36:19.240 --> 1:36:27.240]  And I think there's enough people out there that have Christmas lists and know who to point the guns at and know who to point the triggers at.
[1:36:27.240 --> 1:36:30.240]  You know, know who to point the guns at and pull the triggers.
[1:36:30.240 --> 1:36:35.240]  They're going to go take care of some business because this is ridiculous.
[1:36:35.240 --> 1:36:44.240]  America has their, there's 330 million people in America that have their BS detectors going off right now.
[1:36:44.240 --> 1:36:46.240]  Oh, the BS stickers are being on going off.
[1:36:46.240 --> 1:36:50.240]  Yeah, I want to try to fix this peacefully, brother, but they're swollen for a war.
[1:36:50.240 --> 1:36:55.240]  Let's just help for peace, prepare for war and hope that they back down.
[1:36:55.240 --> 1:36:57.240]  I appreciate your call, Jim.
[1:36:57.240 --> 1:37:00.240]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dragos in Georgia.
[1:37:00.240 --> 1:37:02.240]  You're on the air.
[1:37:02.240 --> 1:37:03.240]  This is Jim.
[1:37:03.240 --> 1:37:04.240]  It's a pleasure speaking to you.
[1:37:04.240 --> 1:37:06.240]  And first time caller.
[1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:09.240]  The listening to you for 20 years of my life.
[1:37:09.240 --> 1:37:16.240]  I just wanted to touch base with the past callers from Poland and other countries.
[1:37:16.240 --> 1:37:21.240]  I was born in Romania and we came here after the revolution.
[1:37:21.240 --> 1:37:32.240]  Supposedly Chalcesco was shot and his family went to Argentina and I wanted to let the American people know that this is real.
[1:37:32.240 --> 1:37:37.240]  This country is going to come back to a full circle from what we left.
[1:37:37.240 --> 1:37:50.240]  You know, my family, we left that country just because my father used to explain to me that we used to get tickets of how many eggs we could eat
[1:37:50.240 --> 1:37:58.240]  or the government could give us if our shoes happened to be broken or ripped or whatever,
[1:37:58.240 --> 1:38:03.240]  that we would have to go physically and the state would give us in a pair of shoes.
[1:38:03.240 --> 1:38:09.240]  And I see this country coming back to a full circle and help American people wake up to this.
[1:38:09.240 --> 1:38:11.240]  Well, absolutely.
[1:38:11.240 --> 1:38:14.240]  And the IMF and World Bank through the WEF is running all this.
[1:38:14.240 --> 1:38:15.240]  They admit they are.
[1:38:15.240 --> 1:38:21.240]  And so they cut off the energy and then make you go to a digital QR code for your food and energy and housing rationing.
[1:38:21.240 --> 1:38:23.240]  That's what the CDC was getting ready.
[1:38:23.240 --> 1:38:24.240]  You're absolutely right.
[1:38:24.240 --> 1:38:31.240]  And for folks that lived in Cuba or lived in Eastern Europe under the Soviets, you guys are some of the best people we've got.
[1:38:31.240 --> 1:38:38.240]  In fact, I welcome people, brown, black, white, you name it, that have experienced tyranny and came here knowing what it was.
[1:38:38.240 --> 1:38:39.240]  You're the best people we've got.
[1:38:39.240 --> 1:38:41.240]  I don't say that to kiss your ass, Dragos.
[1:38:41.240 --> 1:38:42.240]  It's true.
[1:38:42.240 --> 1:38:49.240]  Most awake people are Polish immigrants and Romanian, Hungarian immigrants and Cuban immigrants who live through this hell.
[1:38:49.240 --> 1:38:53.240]  And they know what they're seeing because you've had the life experience.
[1:38:53.240 --> 1:38:54.240]  Absolutely.
[1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:55.240]  I completely agree.
[1:38:55.240 --> 1:39:00.240]  You know, we definitely are, you know, from a different country, but this is our home now.
[1:39:00.240 --> 1:39:09.240]  So we have to uphold by the Constitution and completely eliminate all the, you know, the people that are completely against it.
[1:39:09.240 --> 1:39:14.240]  And how I grew up here in this country made me realize what we left and what we have.
[1:39:14.240 --> 1:39:18.240]  You know, it's not about the materialistic things, but it brought us closer to God, to this country.
[1:39:18.240 --> 1:39:27.240]  And it definitely opened up our eyes that, wow, I can't believe my parents, my father even went to jail because he was trying to flee that country.
[1:39:27.240 --> 1:39:28.240]  God bless your father.
[1:39:28.240 --> 1:39:30.240]  God bless your father, Dragos.
[1:39:30.240 --> 1:39:31.240]  Thank you.
[1:39:31.240 --> 1:39:34.240]  In fact, I keep meaning to do this and I don't do it.
[1:39:34.240 --> 1:39:41.240]  I do a whole show or a group of shows just taking calls from immigrants that left tyranny and why you came here and what you see happening.
[1:39:41.240 --> 1:39:42.240]  Those are the most amazing calls.
[1:39:42.240 --> 1:39:43.240]  I think the listeners all agree.
[1:39:43.240 --> 1:39:45.240]  Dragos' call was powerful.
[1:39:45.240 --> 1:39:50.240]  Now, let's play that clip out of Sri Lanka.
[1:39:50.240 --> 1:39:53.240]  For radio listeners, I'll try to narrate it, but here it is.
[1:39:53.240 --> 1:39:59.240]  People are pulling into a gas station.
[1:39:59.240 --> 1:40:01.240]  They're being rationed down.
[1:40:01.240 --> 1:40:05.240]  They're just a few gallons a week.
[1:40:05.240 --> 1:40:08.240]  The QR code again puts you on the system.
[1:40:08.240 --> 1:40:13.240]  This is why the IMF and World Bank through the W.E.F. collapsed the country by design.
[1:40:13.240 --> 1:40:15.240]  Now, everyone's being forced onto this permanent system.
[1:40:15.240 --> 1:40:20.240]  The track and trace, everything they do and restrict their movement.
[1:40:20.240 --> 1:40:22.240]  Absolutely incredible.
[1:40:22.240 --> 1:40:26.240]  All right, we're going to go to break and we're going to come back and take a ton of calls.
[1:40:26.240 --> 1:40:32.240]  And then next hour, I'm going to hit the vaccine news and the SSRI news that is the biggest yet.
[1:40:32.240 --> 1:40:35.240]  I mean, really, it just gets crazier every day.
[1:40:35.240 --> 1:40:39.240]  I get up here and I don't just say today's the biggest news in this topic.
[1:40:39.240 --> 1:40:41.240]  And then a week later, it's the biggest ever now.
[1:40:41.240 --> 1:40:43.240]  It's all moving so quick.
[1:40:43.240 --> 1:40:44.240]  You know, I'm not hyping that.
[1:40:44.240 --> 1:40:46.240]  You know, you're experiencing it.
[1:40:46.240 --> 1:40:47.240]  I got to say this.
[1:40:47.240 --> 1:40:49.240]  I'm not a weak person.
[1:40:49.240 --> 1:40:51.240]  I mean, I think I'm pretty strong.
[1:40:51.240 --> 1:41:00.240]  And I don't know how to describe the feeling I've got now as a father at 48 with four children.
[1:41:00.240 --> 1:41:06.240]  And as the creator of this movement against the new world order.
[1:41:06.240 --> 1:41:11.240]  It's sadness is the feeling, but also frustration.
[1:41:11.240 --> 1:41:15.240]  That everything we said now happened.
[1:41:15.240 --> 1:41:18.240]  And there's this feeling of doom.
[1:41:18.240 --> 1:41:27.240]  And there's all these idiots following satanic orders going along with this when there's no reason to destroy your own self interest, your own self preservation instincts.
[1:41:27.240 --> 1:41:36.240]  But the whole new world order is about going against your instincts, going against common sense, going against your very life force.
[1:41:36.240 --> 1:41:38.240]  And it's frustrating.
[1:41:38.240 --> 1:41:39.240]  Several big points.
[1:41:39.240 --> 1:41:41.240]  We are self funded by you.
[1:41:41.240 --> 1:41:45.240]  We're very humble and thankful for your support and that you've commissioned us in this fight.

[1:41:53.240 --> 1:42:01.240]  And looked at, because I'm the guy running this place and that's good and bad of what do we have that will fund the operation inside quality.
[1:42:01.240 --> 1:42:09.240]  We have all three of the toothpaste, the activated charcoal, the super coral calcium whitening toothpaste, and you asked for it.
[1:42:09.240 --> 1:42:10.240]  It's back super blue.
[1:42:10.240 --> 1:42:19.240]  The original, all these are 50% together or 40% off individually and that funds our operation.
[1:42:19.240 --> 1:42:22.240]  And we're doing all this as a clearance, even though these are good sellers.
[1:42:22.240 --> 1:42:24.240]  We have to have the money in here now.

[1:44:31.240 --> 1:44:42.240]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[1:44:42.240 --> 1:44:51.240]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.

[1:46:35.240 --> 1:46:48.240]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula. Folks, this is a joke. I mean, we're giving this thing away. It's 75% off. By the way, it works for me. In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[1:46:48.240 --> 1:47:06.240]  Quite well, I might add. Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men. I go and see him quite often now.
[1:47:35.240 --> 1:47:45.240]  I'm still astonished that some folks, and I felt this satisfying in Congress yesterday, some folks seem to really struggle to let go of the status quo.
[1:47:45.240 --> 1:48:01.240]  The average household uses 17% of their electricity for air conditioning, and that would mean the average household uses 1,870 kilowatt hours per year for air conditioning.
[1:48:01.240 --> 1:48:13.240]  If that average household plugged in electric cars, do you know how much more electricity they would use in comparison to the air conditioning, that air conditions their whole house?
[1:48:13.240 --> 1:48:16.240]  No, but again, I would emphasize it will be less energy overall.
[1:48:16.240 --> 1:48:28.240]  Let me help you with that first before we go on, because the numbers are important. It would take four times as much electricity to charge the average household's cars as the average household uses on air conditioning.
[1:48:28.240 --> 1:48:42.240]  Do you think that could be... So if we reach the goal by 2030 that Biden has of 50% adoption instead of 100% adoption, that means the average household would use twice as much electricity charging one of their cars.
[1:48:42.240 --> 1:48:48.240]  As they would use for all of the air conditioning that they use for the entire year.
[1:48:48.240 --> 1:48:55.240]  Of course, the more pain we are all experiencing from the high price of gas, the more benefit there is for those who can access electric vehicles.
[1:48:55.240 --> 1:49:08.240]  This afternoon, the Secretary General and Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum, will witness the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding on a Strategic Partnership between the UN and the World Economic Forum,
[1:49:08.240 --> 1:49:19.240]  which outlines areas of cooperation to deepen engagement between the two institutions and to jointly accelerate the implementation of the 2030 agenda.
[1:49:19.240 --> 1:49:29.240]  About 2030 doesn't exist for the New York Times. Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:49:29.240 --> 1:49:34.240]  Take your phone calls. Lisa in Maine, you're on the air, go ahead.
[1:49:34.240 --> 1:49:46.240]  Hi, Alex. I wouldn't even know about you if my roommate hadn't turned me on to your show 12 years ago, and I can't believe how stupid I was before I started listening to you.
[1:49:46.240 --> 1:50:01.240]  I have a couple of points I wanted to bring up. I think that the Supreme Court actually really overstepped their bounds when they wouldn't let Rand Paul speak about the Constitution.
[1:50:01.240 --> 1:50:13.240]  Our Constitution was written for a reason to give us free speech, give us the right to carry arms, to bear arms, to protect ourselves, and they're just trying to wipe everything out.
[1:50:13.240 --> 1:50:19.240]  As far as the electric car goes, if they turn off the power, where are you going to go? How are you going to get your car going?
[1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:34.240]  I'm just so fearful and so up in the air about what to do. I don't understand why we aren't even considering a class action suit against the government.
[1:50:34.240 --> 1:50:36.240]  As far as Kamala Harris could...
[1:50:36.240 --> 1:50:43.240]  Well, I mean, the Supreme Court, get back to Kamala Harris. The Supreme Court ruled three weeks ago, Biden and the EPA can't do this, but they're still doing it.
[1:50:43.240 --> 1:50:51.240]  So that's a great point you raised. The Supreme Court, forget a lawsuit, I'm not saying you're wrong, because that's the lowest level of it. The highest level has already said no, which is a common sense thing.
[1:50:51.240 --> 1:51:06.240]  And again, they're cutting electrical output for the U.S. It's going down while they want to make everybody go to electric cars, which the average person can't afford, and if the battery blows up because of subsidies, the average electric car costs less than the actual batteries that are in it.
[1:51:06.240 --> 1:51:15.240]  So they're just getting us in a totally dependent place. They're cutting off the energy, both oil and systems that create and generate electricity, which is also fossil fuel.
[1:51:15.240 --> 1:51:21.240]  While they tell us this is a transition, it's not. It's a collapse. It's a shutdown. Back to Kamala Harris.
[1:51:21.240 --> 1:51:37.240]  And Kamala Harris, she is Egyptian and Indian, and they're talking about getting Joe Biden out of office and putting her in. She's not American. And I thought the president had to be American. Don't get me wrong.
[1:51:37.240 --> 1:51:51.240]  She had a 9.9% less than 1% approval rating with whites and Hispanics in Gallup polls when she was running for president. She had a 0.4% with blacks. Blacks know she's not black.
[1:51:51.240 --> 1:52:04.240]  Nothing against Indians. Nothing against Egyptians. But the whole thing is to say you're black is like Pocahontas, you know, Senator Warren saying she's Native American. She's not.
[1:52:04.240 --> 1:52:19.240]  Absolutely. Absolutely. And I'm very fearful about mobs in the streets. And I have a big house, 17 room colonial house. I don't know how we're going to protect it on our own.
[1:52:19.240 --> 1:52:33.240]  But that's a very real fear for me. If people start going crazy because of all these cuts and taken away and no food in the market, then it's terrifying.
[1:52:33.240 --> 1:52:41.240]  Cloth swabs, angrier world. Well, get a fence up and get a dog. And we got the second amendment. God bless you. I hear you though. We're all in this together.
[1:52:41.240 --> 1:52:51.240]  All right. Up next, let's go ahead and talk to Darrell in Missouri. Darrell, thanks.
[1:52:51.240 --> 1:52:57.240]  Hey, Darrell McClanahan, I'm a candidate from Missouri US Senate. Thank you for taking the call, Alex.
[1:52:57.240 --> 1:52:58.240]  Yes, sir.
[1:52:58.240 --> 1:53:13.240]  Long time listener. What are your thoughts on military folks? The Navy SEALs were to have killed Osama bin Laden and then we have Navy SEALs like Bill Irwin here in Missouri running for Congress.
[1:53:13.240 --> 1:53:23.240]  I met and he showed me his DEA undercover card where he was a DEA agent that went undercover and then we have Eric Greitens, of course, who's running.
[1:53:23.240 --> 1:53:34.240]  Well, nobody in armed services is more political than Navy SEALs. I don't individually judge them, but on average, it is the most political globalist branch of our military.
[1:53:34.240 --> 1:53:53.240]  Yeah, in 2013, Eric Greitens won Young Leadership Awards from like the World Economic Forum. He's a globalist in disguise. You know, we have Mark McCloskey that everyone thinks is, you know, he's telling everyone he'll fight for Missourians, but he won't even fight for himself.
[1:53:53.240 --> 1:54:07.240]  He gave his AR-15 up to the court. He's not suing Black Lives Matter for tearing the gate down and property damage, and he's an attorney. He tells people he's not a politician when all attorneys do is make...
[1:54:07.240 --> 1:54:16.240]  And, you know, Fox News here in Missouri wouldn't let me participate in the debate. They said I didn't have enough money and I don't have a forward-facing website.
[1:54:16.240 --> 1:54:24.240]  You look at their pages, web page with candidates, and they have links to people's Facebooks. You can find me on Facebook.
[1:54:24.240 --> 1:54:33.240]  No, no, I hear you. I hear you. Well, thank you, sir, for the call. God bless you. All right, let's take another call. Let's talk to Kyle Yen, New Jersey. Go ahead, Kyle.
[1:54:33.240 --> 1:54:42.240]  Hey, Alex Jones, man, you are a Jewish gatekeeper. If anybody wants to know the truth, go to Brother Nathaniel on BitShoot.
[1:54:42.240 --> 1:54:48.240]  Jewish gatekeeper. Tell me more how I work for the Jews.
[1:54:48.240 --> 1:54:57.240]  Your current wife's Jewish. Your ex-wife was Jewish. You're basically bought off and sold off to the globalists. You keep people outside the fence. You don't let them go in and see who the real players are.
[1:54:57.240 --> 1:55:02.240]  And it's the Jews. If you want to know the truth, go to Brother Nathaniel on BitShoot.com.
[1:55:02.240 --> 1:55:19.240]  We already heard that, but just humor me. It's true that my ex-wife's a quarter Jewish. If she was, it would be fine. But my great wife is 75% German from Omaha and 25% Polish.
[1:55:19.240 --> 1:55:32.240]  Because I've got their family reunions, whether he might as well be in the middle of Germany. So it would be okay if she was Jewish, but she's not. I'm just here to promote America and freedom.
[1:55:32.240 --> 1:55:42.240]  And you call in saying that I, I mean, what particular group of Jews do I work for? Because, you know, the Jews are a diverse group of people. What group of Jews do I work for?
[1:55:42.240 --> 1:55:56.240]  You work for, all the Jews have the same body all the time. But then rabbi, rap, who's he? Super hilarious, by the way. I mean, I like, I've seen that Captain Guys video. It's very entertaining. He's Jewish, but he's good, right? But I'm bad.
[1:55:56.240 --> 1:56:02.240]  No, Jews are generally the scum of the earth. And that's just the truth. They want to destroy America and destroy Korea.
[1:56:02.240 --> 1:56:11.240]  But listen, man, you understand, I'm like talking about keeping the lights on and energy. Shouldn't that transcend whether you're German or Jewish or Russian or Mexican?
[1:56:11.240 --> 1:56:18.240]  Well, Schwab is Jewish. He controls the World Economic Forum. The Rothschild Bank is Jewish. They control the entirety of the banking system.
[1:56:18.240 --> 1:56:31.240]  Okay, well, let me just say this call. When I do see the stuff from the Alex Jones is Jewish or Bill Hicks crowd, you always, people say it's a fake show and fake callers. Are you a fake caller?
[1:56:31.240 --> 1:56:32.240]  No, I'm 100% real.
[1:56:32.240 --> 1:56:37.240]  Oh, so did anybody keep you from your speech here?
[1:56:37.240 --> 1:56:39.240]  I'll tell you what, I appreciate that Alex Jones.
[1:56:39.240 --> 1:56:50.240]  I'm going to ask you again, just have the decency, the basic human decency where you won't is free speech alive here on the Jewish mothership.
[1:56:50.240 --> 1:56:52.240]  Again, you're a gatekeeper.
[1:56:52.240 --> 1:56:59.240]  Okay, I'm sorry. So, so, so, so you're a fake caller. I paid you to call in. You work for me.
[1:56:59.240 --> 1:57:03.240]  Have brother Nathaniel on hold on, hold on, hold on.
[1:57:03.240 --> 1:57:09.240]  I'm going to ask you again, were you put on air right now and not censored?
[1:57:09.240 --> 1:57:10.240]  No, you are. I was.
[1:57:10.240 --> 1:57:12.240]  That's right. Thanks for the call.
[1:57:12.240 --> 1:57:17.240]  Unbelievable mental illness.
[1:57:17.240 --> 1:57:26.240]  I don't give a rat's ass if you're from Chile or Mexico or South Africa or Germany or Israel or Japan or Russia or Canada.
[1:57:26.240 --> 1:57:35.240]  I don't care if you're brown, white or what, you love freedom, you love freedom, I love you. This crap about Jews and all this other stuff.
[1:57:35.240 --> 1:57:41.240]  It's the left that pushes all this and hopes we pick up on it. Shame on you. Shame on you.
[1:57:41.240 --> 1:57:43.240]  I work for Jesus Christ.
[1:57:43.240 --> 1:57:57.240]  We'll be right back.
[1:58:26.240 --> 1:58:34.240]  So, the only way you fail is not taking action today and ordering Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula at infowarstore.com.

[1:58:59.240 --> 1:59:04.240]  So, we looked at the supplement market that we fund a lot of our operations with and we said,
[1:59:04.240 --> 1:59:10.240]  what are the best selling natural, healthy, anti-fat weight loss products that are out there?
[1:59:10.240 --> 1:59:16.240]  We went and looked at the top 10 and they all had the same ingredients in common that is in this product.
[1:59:16.240 --> 1:59:28.240]  But with our new product from X7 Diet Force, we got the very best concentrates of these known natural essences that just do amazing things for your body.
[1:59:28.240 --> 1:59:36.240]  And so, I've lost almost 40 pounds. I'm so a little bit overweight in the last three months and I've been doing it using Diet Force and also exercise.
[1:59:36.240 --> 1:59:43.240]  Well, now Diet Force is exclusively available right now at infowarstore.com, 40% off.
[1:59:43.240 --> 1:59:59.240]  Infowarstore.com, Diet Force, you need to take this product, it really works.
[1:59:59.240 --> 2:00:07.240]  We have to act. Extreme weather disrupts supply chains, causing delays and shortages for consumers and businesses.
[2:00:07.240 --> 2:00:13.240]  Climate change is literally an existential threat to our nation and to the world.
[2:00:13.240 --> 2:00:20.240]  Propped up in Somerset, Massachusetts, Joe Biden, United Nations Agenda 2030 puppet,
[2:00:20.240 --> 2:00:26.240]  signaled that he would soon grant himself illegal climate change emergency powers
[2:00:26.240 --> 2:00:33.240]  that could bring a screeching halt to U.S. exports of crude oil and eliminate offshore drilling,
[2:00:33.240 --> 2:00:41.240]  ushering in the very real possibility of converting military funding to construction of renewable energy projects.
[2:00:41.240 --> 2:00:47.240]  Motivated, fit and academically proficient men and women continues to be a challenge.
[2:00:47.240 --> 2:00:53.240]  Only 23% of military aged men and women in the United States are qualified to serve.
[2:00:53.240 --> 2:00:58.240]  This is an emergency, an emergency, and I will, I will look at it that way.
[2:00:58.240 --> 2:01:06.240]  I said last week, I'll say it again loud and clear, as president I'll use my executive powers to combat the climate crisis
[2:01:06.240 --> 2:01:11.240]  and the absence of congressional action. Now we're standing there in incredible action.
[2:01:11.240 --> 2:01:20.240]  SEGs for the IMF and World Bank and a Rothschild Clinton Obama carbon consortium in London,
[2:01:20.240 --> 2:01:25.240]  the company's called Gore and Blood, I'm not joking, it's Al Gore and his partner,
[2:01:25.240 --> 2:01:31.240]  we'll track and regulate everything you do and control what you do in live time
[2:01:31.240 --> 2:01:35.240]  and we'll decide what businesses are even allowed to operate.
[2:01:35.240 --> 2:01:42.240]  To ratchet up the fear and confuse the public into assuming all is well with the globalist build back better calamity,
[2:01:42.240 --> 2:01:49.240]  UN agenda 2030 salesman Joe Biden made many claims that simply aren't true.
[2:01:49.240 --> 2:01:55.240]  He says them and said in the Arctic and the Antarctic, temperatures that are just unbelievable, melting the permafrost.
[2:01:55.240 --> 2:01:58.240]  It's astounding the damage is being done.
[2:01:58.240 --> 2:02:04.240]  If you took a very careful look with consistent data over long periods of time,
[2:02:04.240 --> 2:02:07.240]  you will find that these disasters are not increasing.
[2:02:07.240 --> 2:02:11.240]  In fact, the health of the world is increasing tremendously.
[2:02:11.240 --> 2:02:16.240]  For example, deaths from weather disasters and so on has gone down about 95%.
[2:02:16.240 --> 2:02:23.240]  On top of confusing, misleading rambling that led many to wondering if the sitting president had cancer,
[2:02:23.240 --> 2:02:26.240]  disaster Joe has stepped in it again.
[2:02:26.240 --> 2:02:31.240]  You had to put on your windshield wipers to get literally the oil slick off the window.
[2:02:31.240 --> 2:02:37.240]  That's why I and so damn many other people I grew up have cancer and why can't for the longest time,
[2:02:37.240 --> 2:02:40.240]  Delaware had the highest cancer rate in the nation.
[2:02:40.240 --> 2:02:45.240]  How can you tell that the United Nations agenda 2030 has already gone off the rails?
[2:02:45.240 --> 2:02:49.240]  Well, in the United Nations Declaration for Agenda 2030,
[2:02:49.240 --> 2:02:57.240]  the authors immediately declared that they recognize that eradicating poverty in all of its forms and dimensions,
[2:02:57.240 --> 2:03:02.240]  including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge.
[2:03:02.240 --> 2:03:11.240]  Yet the hasty power grab disguised as a green energy revolution has already plunged Europe's economy into chaos.
[2:03:11.240 --> 2:03:19.240]  Extreme global poverty and mass starvation is the United Nations goal and the world is responding.
[2:03:19.240 --> 2:03:25.240]  I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing
[2:03:25.240 --> 2:03:32.240]  and will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions.
[2:03:32.240 --> 2:03:36.240]  So, economic activity is slowing.
[2:03:36.240 --> 2:03:41.240]  But don't count Joe Biden's globalist puppet masters out.
[2:03:41.240 --> 2:03:47.240]  If you take the time to actually research the writings of the architects of global governance,
[2:03:47.240 --> 2:03:54.240]  the United Nations Agenda 2030 debacle that is well underway is nothing short of a psychotic power grab
[2:03:54.240 --> 2:03:59.240]  by the emerging technocratic eugenicists posing as our saviors.
[2:03:59.240 --> 2:04:06.240]  Dismantling the global economy piece by piece inching towards neo-feudal insanity.
[2:04:06.240 --> 2:04:12.240]  We're going to defend the rules-based international order that protects us all.
[2:04:12.240 --> 2:04:21.240]  If you give corporations and armies, for instance, the technology to start messing with our DNA, to start messing with our brains,
[2:04:21.240 --> 2:04:30.240]  they would like to amplify certain human qualities that they need, like discipline and like even intelligence.
[2:04:30.240 --> 2:04:32.240]  Everybody can talk about intelligence.
[2:04:32.240 --> 2:04:41.240]  But they don't need other human qualities like compassion or like artistic sensitivity or like spirituality.
[2:04:41.240 --> 2:04:46.240]  The United Nations leading international climate scientists call the latest climate report,
[2:04:46.240 --> 2:04:51.240]  nothing less than quote, Code Red for Humanity.
[2:04:59.240 --> 2:05:04.240]  The globalists are doing everything they can to destroy heterosexual relationships,
[2:05:04.240 --> 2:05:07.240]  to annihilate the family, to split up marriages.
[2:05:07.240 --> 2:05:12.240]  And if you look at the studies, the number one cause of marriages breaking up
[2:05:12.240 --> 2:05:17.240]  is the fact that the men cannot satisfy their women in the bedroom.
[2:05:17.240 --> 2:05:19.240]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:05:19.240 --> 2:05:24.240]  And even if you're like me and hardly ever have a problem, I mean, all of us one for another too, that's just the truth.
[2:05:24.240 --> 2:05:27.240]  The liberals will make fun of that, but everybody knows that's true.
[2:05:27.240 --> 2:05:30.240]  But whether you rarely have any issues or have them on a regular basis,
[2:05:30.240 --> 2:05:35.240]  InstaHeart is the number one best-selling natural herbal supplement in the world

[2:06:27.240 --> 2:06:28.240]  We don't screen your calls.
[2:06:28.240 --> 2:06:31.240]  All you ask is a clean phone line where you're calling from.
[2:06:31.240 --> 2:06:33.240]  You want to give us a topic? That's great.
[2:06:33.240 --> 2:06:35.240]  We heard the end of the last hour.
[2:06:35.240 --> 2:06:37.240]  You heard a caller call in.
[2:06:37.240 --> 2:06:39.240]  You're working for the Jews.
[2:06:39.240 --> 2:06:43.240]  Like he scored some magic point and like, God, it's bizarre.
[2:06:43.240 --> 2:06:51.240]  I'm promoting free speech, capitalism, Christianity, and low energy prices.
[2:06:51.240 --> 2:06:53.240]  And I've never been to Israel. I do want to go there.
[2:06:53.240 --> 2:06:55.240]  I want to go to Egypt. I want to go to Russia.
[2:06:55.240 --> 2:06:58.240]  I want to go to Japan. I want to go to South America.
[2:06:58.240 --> 2:07:00.240]  But I've never been there.
[2:07:00.240 --> 2:07:10.240]  And what I love is the weird mentally ill underground of the internet that never gets censored by Big Tag,
[2:07:10.240 --> 2:07:13.240]  obsesses on people's identities and steals them.
[2:07:13.240 --> 2:07:15.240]  So let me just give you my identity.
[2:07:15.240 --> 2:07:18.240]  Both sides of my family were on the Mayflower.
[2:07:18.240 --> 2:07:23.240]  I'm related to the tutors directly on both sides of the family.
[2:07:23.240 --> 2:07:26.240]  On both sides of my family, we founded Texas.
[2:07:26.240 --> 2:07:29.240]  My mother's side of the family raised Colonel Travis.
[2:07:29.240 --> 2:07:32.240]  And that's who we left him with in Gonzales.
[2:07:32.240 --> 2:07:36.240]  And my family was involved in the founding of the country.
[2:07:36.240 --> 2:07:42.240]  On my mother's side of the family, the Greshams invented the stock exchange.
[2:07:42.240 --> 2:07:44.240]  I mean, I went through all the family line.
[2:07:44.240 --> 2:07:46.240]  I stand for what I've done and who I am.
[2:07:46.240 --> 2:07:51.240]  But I would say the family line is mainly English and Germanic.
[2:07:51.240 --> 2:07:54.240]  And then there's a little bit of Scott and Iris there on my side.
[2:07:54.240 --> 2:07:58.240]  And then it was obsessed with bloodlines.
[2:07:58.240 --> 2:08:02.240]  Everybody knows Omaha is a German and Polish city.
[2:08:02.240 --> 2:08:04.240]  My wife is from Omaha.
[2:08:04.240 --> 2:08:06.240]  And you get to see those communities.
[2:08:06.240 --> 2:08:09.240]  You don't see that most of the country where a community is still together.
[2:08:09.240 --> 2:08:12.240]  And you go there and there are a bunch of Germans, quite good looking people.
[2:08:12.240 --> 2:08:15.240]  And I'm proud of my German background.
[2:08:15.240 --> 2:08:18.240]  But my Alsatian background on my mother's side.
[2:08:18.240 --> 2:08:19.240]  And that's it.
[2:08:19.240 --> 2:08:24.240]  And my wife's grandmother was pure Polish.
[2:08:24.240 --> 2:08:27.240]  And my daughter looks just like her grandmother.
[2:08:27.240 --> 2:08:30.240]  And so it has those Polish features.
[2:08:30.240 --> 2:08:32.240]  My five-year-old little sweetie pie.
[2:08:32.240 --> 2:08:35.240]  And so I would be proud if I was Jewish, like Dr. Zelinko,
[2:08:35.240 --> 2:08:39.240]  a great soul who stood up for Human Liberty who just died a few weeks ago.
[2:08:39.240 --> 2:08:44.240]  But just steal my identity and say I'm Jewish or my family is.
[2:08:44.240 --> 2:08:46.240]  It's just not who we are.
[2:08:46.240 --> 2:08:49.240]  I'm pure blood Americana.
[2:08:49.240 --> 2:08:52.240]  You probably couldn't get more Americana.
[2:08:52.240 --> 2:08:56.240]  If you want to know who I am, where I come from, it's 1776.
[2:08:56.240 --> 2:09:01.240]  High-level Revolutionary War in 1776.
[2:09:01.240 --> 2:09:04.240]  And then on the Confederate side, very high-level there,
[2:09:04.240 --> 2:09:08.240]  generals, colonels, you name it, some of those famous people in the side of the south.
[2:09:08.240 --> 2:09:10.240]  I don't really like that war.
[2:09:10.240 --> 2:09:13.240]  I think the south got tricked into it by British intelligence.
[2:09:13.240 --> 2:09:15.240]  And I think it was a terrible war.
[2:09:15.240 --> 2:09:16.240]  It was about Western expansion.
[2:09:16.240 --> 2:09:17.240]  It was about slavery.
[2:09:17.240 --> 2:09:19.240]  But that's who I am.
[2:09:19.240 --> 2:09:26.240]  And so to try to steal my identity and say that I'm some other group or I'm doing this or that,
[2:09:26.240 --> 2:09:29.240]  I don't make this about identity politics, like the left does.
[2:09:29.240 --> 2:09:33.240]  But the left does it, but also not the right wing,
[2:09:33.240 --> 2:09:42.240]  but more like a mentally ill group, lives to obsess over the background of somebody.
[2:09:42.240 --> 2:09:45.240]  And then they project lies onto that.
[2:09:45.240 --> 2:09:49.240]  And it's just not true, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:09:49.240 --> 2:09:55.240]  You know, my family was extremely anti-communist in the 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s and 90s,
[2:09:55.240 --> 2:10:02.240]  and was involved in a lot of the operations against the Russians in Europe and in Latin America.
[2:10:02.240 --> 2:10:04.240]  And that's all very secretive.
[2:10:04.240 --> 2:10:09.240]  I was never told details of it until, like, funerals.
[2:10:09.240 --> 2:10:14.240]  And the retired general or colonel will get up at the funeral and talk about, you know,
[2:10:14.240 --> 2:10:18.240]  your family members 30 years in army special operations and all of that.
[2:10:18.240 --> 2:10:20.240]  You know, they never give what they did.
[2:10:20.240 --> 2:10:24.240]  So I mean, it's just very offensive to try to steal my identity.
[2:10:24.240 --> 2:10:25.240]  I'm red, white and blue.
[2:10:25.240 --> 2:10:26.240]  I mean, I'll just say it.
[2:10:26.240 --> 2:10:28.240]  I'm not bragging because America's got its problems.
[2:10:28.240 --> 2:10:35.240]  But if there's a symbol of America, it's this broadcast what we do and the fruits of this broadcast.
[2:10:35.240 --> 2:10:37.240]  And that's why they hate us.
[2:10:37.240 --> 2:10:39.240]  The enemy knows my pedigree.
[2:10:39.240 --> 2:10:42.240]  The enemy knows what my ancestors did.
[2:10:42.240 --> 2:10:48.240]  And they know I have the will and their genetic and spiritual capacity to carry it out.
[2:10:48.240 --> 2:10:50.240]  And they can't stand it.
[2:10:50.240 --> 2:10:54.240]  They hate me because I am America.
[2:10:54.240 --> 2:10:57.240]  I am 1776.
[2:10:57.240 --> 2:11:03.240]  And I have the will through Christ Jesus to break the New World Order's will.
[2:11:03.240 --> 2:11:04.240]  And so do you.
[2:11:04.240 --> 2:11:05.240]  And I got a big 10 here.
[2:11:05.240 --> 2:11:07.240]  I don't care if you're from Nigeria.
[2:11:07.240 --> 2:11:09.240]  I don't care if you're from Mexico.
[2:11:09.240 --> 2:11:13.240]  I don't care if you're from Germany or Russia or Albania or Japan.
[2:11:13.240 --> 2:11:16.240]  I don't care if you're from Canada or Australia.
[2:11:16.240 --> 2:11:21.240]  I don't care if you're from Chile or you're from Italy.
[2:11:21.240 --> 2:11:28.240]  If you love freedom and you love justice and you oppose the New World Order, you're my brother.
[2:11:28.240 --> 2:11:35.240]  And I support and back you 100%.
[2:11:35.240 --> 2:11:41.240]  I can tell you some stories, but they're so fantastical that I'm not going to tell you.
[2:11:41.240 --> 2:11:50.240]  But my mother's father on his father's side came from wealthy Germans in Texas.
[2:11:50.240 --> 2:11:55.240]  And when he was in high school, when they lived the most wealthy part of Dallas,
[2:11:55.240 --> 2:12:00.240]  he was an apprentice for the inventor of air conditioning.
[2:12:00.240 --> 2:12:09.240]  And the Nazis in the 30s sucked all the money out of that man by threatening to kill his family in Germany.
[2:12:09.240 --> 2:12:13.240]  And so my grandfather joined the Army Air Corps after that on other things.
[2:12:13.240 --> 2:12:21.240]  But he was heavily involved early on, even before World War II started,
[2:12:21.240 --> 2:12:28.240]  in working against the Nazis because of those wealthy Germans and what he was involved in and what he saw.
[2:12:28.240 --> 2:12:36.240]  And growing up, I got to learn about all those things because my German ancestors came from what Hitler would call
[2:12:36.240 --> 2:12:39.240]  the Uber-Menschen or the Superman.
[2:12:39.240 --> 2:12:44.240]  Now, I don't think I'm a Superman and I don't think I'm the Uber-Menschen.
[2:12:44.240 --> 2:12:53.240]  But to have people call in here and tell me that I'm on some leash to Israel or that I work for that,
[2:12:53.240 --> 2:12:58.240]  when I come from a recognized family of the Uber-Menschen is a joke.
[2:12:58.240 --> 2:13:03.240]  And you people are a joke and you are pathetic and you are sick.
[2:13:03.240 --> 2:13:10.240]  And you have no effect on me and you don't stop what we're doing, but we're going to free humanity.
[2:13:10.240 --> 2:13:15.240]  There aren't just Germans that want to dominate and run everybody's lives. There are Germans that want to empower humanity.
[2:13:15.240 --> 2:13:19.240]  But surpassing the Germans is the British.
[2:13:19.240 --> 2:13:25.240]  And that's my real bloodline of dominant resistance to the New World Order.
[2:13:25.240 --> 2:13:28.240]  It's not from my mother's family, but from my father's family.
[2:13:28.240 --> 2:13:30.240]  I'll just give you the secrets right here.
[2:13:30.240 --> 2:13:34.240]  And that bloodline is the strongest there is in the fight against Satan.
[2:13:34.240 --> 2:13:40.240]  So you will burn in hell before we ever surrender to you people and we will go into planetary and humanity will win.
[2:13:40.240 --> 2:13:44.240]  And I'm done talking about it.
[2:13:44.240 --> 2:13:48.240]  But you fools that sit around and talk about your supremacy.
[2:13:48.240 --> 2:13:54.240]  Someone who is really supreme would empower humanity and enslave them and not kill them.
[2:13:54.240 --> 2:14:03.240]  Like Klaus Schwab and the Rothschilds and the New World Order and all these other groups like Noah Harari.
[2:14:03.240 --> 2:14:05.240]  But I'm done.
[2:14:05.240 --> 2:14:08.240]  That's who I am. That's where I come from.
[2:14:08.240 --> 2:14:10.240]  That's what I stand for.
[2:14:10.240 --> 2:14:16.240]  And we trump with the ace of spades and the royal flush anything you people can do.
[2:14:16.240 --> 2:14:20.240]  Because the truth is, Info War supports God.
[2:14:20.240 --> 2:14:22.240]  Info War supports God's vision.
[2:14:22.240 --> 2:14:29.240]  And Info Wars is trying every day, though we're imperfect, to align with God.
[2:14:29.240 --> 2:14:36.240]  And we will do it and we will never surrender and we will never get into the Satanism period.
[2:14:36.240 --> 2:14:45.240]  And we love everybody, whether they're in Guatemala or whether they are in Timbuktu.
[2:14:45.240 --> 2:14:48.240]  And I care about every person under satanic attack.
[2:14:48.240 --> 2:14:55.240]  And I think every person has the essence of God in them, whether they are in India or whether they are in Sri Lanka.
[2:14:55.240 --> 2:15:00.240]  And I am a brother to every person, black, white, yellow, brown, red.
[2:15:00.240 --> 2:15:07.240]  And I, in front of God, salute humanity and commit myself to fight for our species.
[2:15:07.240 --> 2:15:16.240]  And I am not a Brit. I am not a German. I am not a Russian. I am not Japanese. I am not Mexican.
[2:15:16.240 --> 2:15:26.240]  I am not Brazilian. I am human with red blood and we will overcome the New World Order.
[2:15:26.240 --> 2:15:34.240]  So damn all the leftist race-paters to hell and damn all the Nazis to hell and damn you all to hell.
[2:15:34.240 --> 2:15:41.240]  That serve this crap. Humanity will unify behind God or we will be destroyed.
[2:15:41.240 --> 2:15:47.240]  And we have unified behind God and we are winning and Satan knows it and can't stand it.
[2:15:57.240 --> 2:16:04.240]  The number one selling category in supplements worldwide is fat burners, is weight loss formulas.
[2:16:04.240 --> 2:16:11.240]  And listen, there are hundreds of them out there that work, but most of them do it in a toxic way.

[2:18:47.240 --> 2:18:50.240]  hackers, criminals, corporations, governments.

[2:19:42.240 --> 2:19:48.240]  By the way, it works for me in case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[2:19:48.240 --> 2:19:50.240]  Quite well, I might add.
[2:19:50.240 --> 2:19:54.240]  Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[2:19:54.240 --> 2:20:19.240]  I go and see him quite often now.
[2:20:24.240 --> 2:20:32.240]  We align ourselves with the truth and show time for all of us to pick a side.
[2:20:32.240 --> 2:20:34.240]  I choose humanity.
[2:20:34.240 --> 2:20:36.240]  We erase color and creed.
[2:20:36.240 --> 2:20:37.240]  I want to empower you.
[2:20:37.240 --> 2:20:38.240]  I want you to empower me.
[2:20:38.240 --> 2:20:40.240]  Together, we're unstoppable.
[2:20:40.240 --> 2:20:42.240]  I love you.
[2:20:42.240 --> 2:20:44.240]  And I will not hate you.
[2:20:44.240 --> 2:20:46.240]  It's what color you are, where you came from.
[2:20:46.240 --> 2:20:52.240]  But if you are used as an enemy of freedom, and if you are forged into a weapon against freedom,
[2:20:52.240 --> 2:21:00.240]  I will stand against you.
[2:21:00.240 --> 2:21:03.240]  Let's go back to your phone calls and I'll hit next segment as I mentioned.
[2:21:03.240 --> 2:21:05.240]  Let's go ahead and go to Matt in Ohio.
[2:21:05.240 --> 2:21:06.240]  Matt, go ahead.
[2:21:06.240 --> 2:21:07.240]  The election in Trump.
[2:21:07.240 --> 2:21:08.240]  Welcome.
[2:21:08.240 --> 2:21:10.240]  How's it going, Mr. Jones?
[2:21:10.240 --> 2:21:11.240]  Welcome.
[2:21:11.240 --> 2:21:14.240]  Before I get to my point, I just want to ask you, when are you ever going to go back on Joe Rogan?
[2:21:14.240 --> 2:21:16.240]  I've been hoping that you'd be going back.
[2:21:16.240 --> 2:21:18.240]  You know, Joe's a good friend of mine.
[2:21:18.240 --> 2:21:20.240]  He talked to me last week, so we get dinner this week.
[2:21:20.240 --> 2:21:22.240]  I haven't called him to set that up.
[2:21:22.240 --> 2:21:23.240]  I mean, I'm friends with Joe.
[2:21:23.240 --> 2:21:24.240]  He lives here.
[2:21:24.240 --> 2:21:28.240]  He got put under a lot of heat having me on.
[2:21:28.240 --> 2:21:31.240]  And so I haven't asked to go on in quite a while.
[2:21:31.240 --> 2:21:32.240]  I'm just leaving it alone.
[2:21:32.240 --> 2:21:33.240]  Waiting for him to ask me.
[2:21:33.240 --> 2:21:37.240]  I'm hoping it's soon, man, because I really enjoy you and Broga on there, man.
[2:21:37.240 --> 2:21:39.240]  It's good stuff.
[2:21:39.240 --> 2:21:44.240]  Joe admits that other than Elon Musk, it's the top shows he ever did with me.
[2:21:44.240 --> 2:21:46.240]  And they make the most money on those shows.
[2:21:46.240 --> 2:21:50.240]  But look, Joe's got his own path to go down. He's made a lot of changes.
[2:21:50.240 --> 2:21:51.240]  He's got a lot better.
[2:21:51.240 --> 2:21:54.240]  So, you know, Joe's his own, his own enterprise.
[2:21:54.240 --> 2:21:56.240]  And we wish Joe well.
[2:21:56.240 --> 2:22:03.240]  I did enjoy the interview you had with Eddie Bravo on this show recently that he has on that paid sign.
[2:22:03.240 --> 2:22:07.240]  I forget the name of it, but that was a really good interview between you and him on this show recently.
[2:22:07.240 --> 2:22:09.240]  Eddie is a real sweetheart.
[2:22:09.240 --> 2:22:11.240]  He's the funniest guy, though.
[2:22:11.240 --> 2:22:13.240]  I mean, that guy is unbelievable.
[2:22:13.240 --> 2:22:14.240]  Yes, he is.
[2:22:14.240 --> 2:22:20.240]  But the point I want to make with Trump is I really don't fully trust Trump because of the whole vaccine stuff still.
[2:22:20.240 --> 2:22:24.240]  That's really kind of like soured me on Trump because I voted for Trump twice.
[2:22:24.240 --> 2:22:30.240]  But with the whole vaccine operation and warped speech stuff, it's just really kind of started me on Trump and Mike.
[2:22:30.240 --> 2:22:31.240]  No, I agree. And it's a deal breaker.
[2:22:31.240 --> 2:22:35.240]  Did you see him last week admit I'm not supposed to say the word, but I'm proud of what I did.
[2:22:35.240 --> 2:22:38.240]  So his people tell him, shut up, stop it.
[2:22:38.240 --> 2:22:40.240]  And so it's like a big turd in the punch bowl.
[2:22:40.240 --> 2:22:42.240]  Everything else he did was really good.
[2:22:42.240 --> 2:22:44.240]  But that is a deal breaker.
[2:22:44.240 --> 2:22:46.240]  But I don't do lesser or two evils.
[2:22:46.240 --> 2:22:50.240]  But man, him and the Santas, wouldn't you like that better than what we got?
[2:22:50.240 --> 2:22:51.240]  Yeah, I mean, I would.
[2:22:51.240 --> 2:22:53.240]  I mean, the economy right now is collapsing.
[2:22:53.240 --> 2:22:55.240]  Everything collapsing around us.
[2:22:55.240 --> 2:22:57.240]  Like it's just getting ridiculous at the point.
[2:22:57.240 --> 2:22:59.240]  And like you said, the lockdowns are definitely coming back.
[2:22:59.240 --> 2:23:03.240]  And did you see what's going on in China with the whole where they're putting tanks in front of their banks?
[2:23:03.240 --> 2:23:07.240]  They first people accounts, bank accounts, and they're putting tanks literally.
[2:23:07.240 --> 2:23:08.240]  Absolutely.
[2:23:08.240 --> 2:23:10.240]  Dude, we're in the collapse.
[2:23:10.240 --> 2:23:14.240]  That's why I tell people, man, I'm really freaked out to the listeners.
[2:23:14.240 --> 2:23:16.240]  Like we're in it, brother.
[2:23:16.240 --> 2:23:17.240]  We are.
[2:23:17.240 --> 2:23:18.240]  Yeah.
[2:23:18.240 --> 2:23:21.240]  And then for people, and for people to focus on you being Jewish or whatever, that's ridiculous.
[2:23:21.240 --> 2:23:23.240]  More important pressing matters.
[2:23:23.240 --> 2:23:29.240]  And well, I mean, if I was Jewish, there are a lot of great Jewish people, a lot of great everybody.
[2:23:29.240 --> 2:23:35.240]  The point is, if you might notice Israeli politics or Jews, there's 20 different groups all fight with each other like any other group.
[2:23:35.240 --> 2:23:38.240]  It's like saying, oh, you're black, so you must be good or bad.
[2:23:38.240 --> 2:23:40.240]  It's robbing my identity and who I am.
[2:23:40.240 --> 2:23:42.240]  And I'm not mad if I was Jewish.
[2:23:42.240 --> 2:23:43.240]  That'd be great.
[2:23:43.240 --> 2:23:44.240]  I'm not Jewish.
[2:23:44.240 --> 2:23:47.240]  And so, and so I'm just, it's retarded.
[2:23:47.240 --> 2:23:48.240]  It's dumb.
[2:23:48.240 --> 2:23:54.240]  And, you know, I don't talk about my Native American background because it would sound like I was bragging.
[2:23:54.240 --> 2:23:59.240]  I don't sleep with that, but it's, it's, it's wild right here in Texas and Oklahoma.
[2:23:59.240 --> 2:24:02.240]  And I'm definitely related to the, I can't believe my pedigree.
[2:24:02.240 --> 2:24:07.240]  I mean, but I go off what I actually do myself, but I'm not going to get up here and tell you,
[2:24:07.240 --> 2:24:12.240]  you know, that I'm related to Quanta Parker because it doesn't matter.
[2:24:12.240 --> 2:24:18.240]  I'm zero Native Americans, just like Pocahontas, but I'm proud of my Native American roots.
[2:24:18.240 --> 2:24:25.240]  I'm proud to be maybe 3% Comanche or at least my dad's like 13% or whatever.
[2:24:25.240 --> 2:24:26.240]  It doesn't matter.
[2:24:26.240 --> 2:24:27.240]  It doesn't matter.
[2:24:27.240 --> 2:24:29.240]  My family got sent to Florida.
[2:24:29.240 --> 2:24:30.240]  Doesn't matter.
[2:24:30.240 --> 2:24:32.240]  They survived 100 years there and came back.
[2:24:32.240 --> 2:24:34.240]  It doesn't matter that all of that.
[2:24:34.240 --> 2:24:38.240]  It doesn't matter because what matters is what I do today.
[2:24:38.240 --> 2:24:39.240]  God bless you.
[2:24:39.240 --> 2:24:41.240]  I appreciate your call, brother.
[2:24:41.240 --> 2:24:43.240]  Let's talk to Kellen in Missouri.
[2:24:43.240 --> 2:24:44.240]  Kellen, you're on here.
[2:24:44.240 --> 2:24:45.240]  Welcome.
[2:24:45.240 --> 2:24:51.240]  Hey, Alex Jones, long time listeners since just after the 9 11 times, I have a couple
[2:24:51.240 --> 2:24:55.240]  comments to make for everyone out there, especially the younger crowd guys.
[2:24:55.240 --> 2:25:00.240]  If you're in that 16 to 25 area, join the police and the fire department now.
[2:25:00.240 --> 2:25:02.240]  Get to know your sheriff.
[2:25:02.240 --> 2:25:03.240]  Exactly.
[2:25:03.240 --> 2:25:08.240]  We need men like that guy in Indiana that went in there and saved five kids.
[2:25:08.240 --> 2:25:11.240]  Well, the fire department sat there playing with their ding dongs.
[2:25:11.240 --> 2:25:14.240]  It was it was unbelievable.
[2:25:14.240 --> 2:25:18.240]  I've been on a volunteer fire department when I was younger and that would have never happened.
[2:25:18.240 --> 2:25:22.240]  There is no order like that to not go in unless someone's not safe.
[2:25:22.240 --> 2:25:24.240]  But guys, that's why we admire firefighters.
[2:25:24.240 --> 2:25:28.240]  They went into burning buildings now just like you've all the they sit there with their
[2:25:28.240 --> 2:25:30.240]  thumbs up their rear ends.
[2:25:30.240 --> 2:25:33.240]  There's something off about that.
[2:25:33.240 --> 2:25:39.240]  But guys, patriots everywhere, every country, China, all the countries, join now, even if
[2:25:39.240 --> 2:25:43.240]  you've got to be a sleeper and you've got to just wait and try not to tarnish your soul
[2:25:43.240 --> 2:25:44.240]  as much as possible.
[2:25:44.240 --> 2:25:50.240]  But then secretly over time, slowly introduce people into the patriot movement, slowly let
[2:25:50.240 --> 2:25:56.240]  your hands show and then snap down on that department and turn it into an actual patriot
[2:25:56.240 --> 2:25:57.240]  outpost.
[2:25:57.240 --> 2:25:58.240]  Do it now.
[2:25:58.240 --> 2:26:00.240]  It doesn't matter if there's evil.
[2:26:00.240 --> 2:26:01.240]  Ask Nazi Jews.
[2:26:01.240 --> 2:26:03.240]  Doesn't matter if there's evil Jesuits or aliens.
[2:26:03.240 --> 2:26:05.240]  Doesn't matter if there's evil in the Masons.
[2:26:05.240 --> 2:26:07.240]  There's good people and everything.
[2:26:07.240 --> 2:26:08.240]  Don't blame.
[2:26:08.240 --> 2:26:09.240]  Exactly.
[2:26:09.240 --> 2:26:11.240]  Attack evil and stop obsessing over groups.
[2:26:11.240 --> 2:26:12.240]  It's ridiculous.
[2:26:12.240 --> 2:26:13.240]  You can see corruption.
[2:26:13.240 --> 2:26:16.240]  They want us to attack on groups so we can't get everybody from a group.
[2:26:16.240 --> 2:26:17.240]  I want the Masons.
[2:26:17.240 --> 2:26:18.240]  I want the Jews.
[2:26:18.240 --> 2:26:19.240]  I want the blacks.
[2:26:19.240 --> 2:26:20.240]  I want the Hispanics.
[2:26:20.240 --> 2:26:21.240]  I want the whites.
[2:26:21.240 --> 2:26:22.240]  I want the Russians.
[2:26:22.240 --> 2:26:23.240]  I want the Asians.
[2:26:23.240 --> 2:26:24.240]  I want everybody.
[2:26:24.240 --> 2:26:25.240]  All of them.
[2:26:25.240 --> 2:26:26.240]  All of them.
[2:26:26.240 --> 2:26:31.240]  Get in those departments even if you have to dumb yourself down and look ridiculously
[2:26:31.240 --> 2:26:33.240]  stupid, that's what they want.
[2:26:33.240 --> 2:26:34.240]  Please do it.
[2:26:34.240 --> 2:26:38.240]  It doesn't matter if you have a promising career unless it is something that will keep
[2:26:38.240 --> 2:26:40.240]  the infrastructure of the United States going.
[2:26:40.240 --> 2:26:41.240]  I agree.
[2:26:41.240 --> 2:26:44.240]  They're doing a purge the military police and fire departments, put their people in.
[2:26:44.240 --> 2:26:46.740]  They were sleeper cells to take over.
[2:26:46.740 --> 2:26:50.240]  We need people to be sleeper cells and take over law enforcement.
[2:26:50.240 --> 2:26:51.240]  Absolutely.
[2:26:51.240 --> 2:26:52.240]  God bless you.
[2:26:52.240 --> 2:26:55.240]  Let's go ahead, ladies and gentlemen, and take another call.
[2:26:55.240 --> 2:26:58.240]  Welcome to Brandon.
[2:26:58.240 --> 2:26:59.240]  Brandon in New York.
[2:26:59.240 --> 2:27:00.240]  Go ahead, Brandon.
[2:27:00.240 --> 2:27:01.240]  Hey, Alex.
[2:27:01.240 --> 2:27:02.240]  Welcome.
[2:27:02.240 --> 2:27:03.240]  You're here, Nick?
[2:27:03.240 --> 2:27:04.240]  Yes, sir.
[2:27:04.240 --> 2:27:10.240]  I just wanted to bring to the attention that's getting zero coverage in the news.
[2:27:10.240 --> 2:27:15.240]  Here in New York, there was a major victory.
[2:27:15.240 --> 2:27:26.240]  There were vocalists trying to circumvent the state legislator and use the Department of
[2:27:26.240 --> 2:27:28.240]  Health to issue quarantines without due process.
[2:27:28.240 --> 2:27:34.240]  On July 8th, there was a lawsuit brought to the New York Supreme Court judge.
[2:27:34.240 --> 2:27:37.240]  They actually shot that down as unconstitution.
[2:27:37.240 --> 2:27:38.240]  I just wanted to bring it up.
[2:27:38.240 --> 2:27:39.240]  You're right.
[2:27:39.240 --> 2:27:43.240]  And in Canada and France and New York, all the new lockdowns and forced inoculations are
[2:27:43.240 --> 2:27:44.240]  being struck down.
[2:27:44.240 --> 2:27:46.240]  We should talk more about that, brother.
[2:27:46.240 --> 2:27:48.240]  Yeah, I agree.
[2:27:48.240 --> 2:27:50.240]  What else is on your mind, Brandon?
[2:27:50.240 --> 2:27:58.240]  That's just really, you know, because up here in upstate New York, there's actually
[2:27:58.240 --> 2:28:02.240]  upstate New York is majority of red.
[2:28:02.240 --> 2:28:05.240]  We want freedom just as everybody else.
[2:28:05.240 --> 2:28:07.240]  So don't read us off.
[2:28:07.240 --> 2:28:10.240]  We're up here fighting as well.
[2:28:10.240 --> 2:28:11.240]  You're beautiful, brother.
[2:28:11.240 --> 2:28:12.240]  I love you.
[2:28:12.240 --> 2:28:13.240]  Thank you so much, Brandon.
[2:28:13.240 --> 2:28:19.240]  All right, Carlos and Dustin, Jeff's up first.
[2:28:19.240 --> 2:28:21.240]  Victor, we're going to your calls on the other side.
[2:28:21.240 --> 2:28:23.240]  I will hit the SSR and I news.
[2:28:23.240 --> 2:28:25.240]  I will hit the COVID news.
[2:28:25.240 --> 2:28:27.240]  I will hit it all.
[2:28:27.240 --> 2:28:32.240]  Paul Watson is going to be hosting the fourth hour today.
[2:28:32.240 --> 2:28:34.240]  And I don't take this broadcast for granted.

[2:33:23.240 --> 2:33:25.240]  I work from nine to five.
[2:33:25.240 --> 2:33:27.240]  Hell, I pay the price.
[2:33:27.240 --> 2:33:31.240]  All I want is to be left alone in my average home.
[2:33:31.240 --> 2:33:36.240]  But why do I always feel like I'm in the 20s and then I always feel...
[2:33:36.240 --> 2:33:40.240]  I'm taking your phone calls right now on this live Thursday transmission that...
[2:33:40.240 --> 2:33:43.240]  I want to just say something more to your calls.

[2:33:54.240 --> 2:33:58.240]  From your intellect, your spirit, your heart, your soul, who you are.
[2:33:58.240 --> 2:34:03.240]  When I understand how much the enemy hates me and how much they come after us
[2:34:03.240 --> 2:34:09.240]  and the horrible dirty tricks they do, it's because I realize they hate you.
[2:34:09.240 --> 2:34:14.240]  And you could be black, you could be Hispanic, Asian, white, you could be whatever.
[2:34:14.240 --> 2:34:18.240]  They hate your ass because you have the potential to control the future.
[2:34:18.240 --> 2:34:21.240]  You have the potential to activate your destiny.
[2:34:21.240 --> 2:34:27.240]  You have the potential, as Mahatma Gandhi said, to be the seed of the universe.
[2:34:27.240 --> 2:34:30.240]  Each one of us has the seed of the universe within us.
[2:34:30.240 --> 2:34:32.240]  That's totally true.
[2:34:32.240 --> 2:34:34.240]  They hate you.
[2:34:34.240 --> 2:34:35.240]  I love you.
[2:34:35.240 --> 2:34:37.240]  You love me.
[2:34:37.240 --> 2:34:39.240]  I love you.
[2:34:39.240 --> 2:34:44.240]  They hate us and they seek to divide us and weaken us.
[2:34:44.240 --> 2:34:54.240]  If we have a code of freedoms and liberties and the love of God, we are invincible.
[2:34:54.240 --> 2:35:04.240]  If we love manhood and womanhood and kinship and the rituals of honor, the archetypes of strength,
[2:35:04.240 --> 2:35:08.240]  we can activate all the ancestral memories of our people
[2:35:08.240 --> 2:35:13.240]  and we can move forward into the future with technology that God gave us.
[2:35:13.240 --> 2:35:16.240]  We are the future.
[2:35:16.240 --> 2:35:21.240]  You are divine creatures made by the all-powerful God.
[2:35:21.240 --> 2:35:23.240]  That's not a statement.
[2:35:23.240 --> 2:35:27.240]  We can manifest anything we want.
[2:35:27.240 --> 2:35:29.240]  Look at what we've done.
[2:35:29.240 --> 2:35:32.240]  I'm betting on human technology.
[2:35:32.240 --> 2:35:36.240]  I'm betting on the human spirit because I know it's the only future we've got.
[2:35:36.240 --> 2:35:38.240]  It's perfect.
[2:35:38.240 --> 2:35:45.240]  The Creator made us to carry this out and to discover our imperfections
[2:35:45.240 --> 2:35:51.240]  and to learn how to govern that incredible power.
[2:35:51.240 --> 2:35:54.240]  These foolish Satanists seek power.
[2:35:54.240 --> 2:35:56.240]  Power is in alignment with God.
[2:35:56.240 --> 2:36:00.240]  Power is in submitting to God.
[2:36:00.240 --> 2:36:11.240]  Power is in being what we were built to be, which is free will, but we choose God.
[2:36:11.240 --> 2:36:19.240]  I am the product of tens of thousands of years of our ancestors and their will to the future.
[2:36:19.240 --> 2:36:22.240]  You are that product as well.
[2:36:22.240 --> 2:36:29.240]  My grandmother, two weeks before she died, the last time I saw her at 92 here in Austin,
[2:36:29.240 --> 2:36:38.240]  told me a lot of things and activated secrets within me that I already knew were there,
[2:36:38.240 --> 2:36:44.240]  but were like seeds in the dirt before the rain comes.
[2:36:44.240 --> 2:36:47.240]  She told me.
[2:36:47.240 --> 2:36:50.240]  She said our ancestors have been praying.
[2:36:50.240 --> 2:36:57.240]  They've been working and putting our energy forward for the moment we are now entering.
[2:36:57.240 --> 2:37:12.240]  And you and your children are the ones that are going to decide the future of humanity.
[2:37:12.240 --> 2:37:16.240]  That was so powerful.
[2:37:16.240 --> 2:37:18.240]  It's so real.
[2:37:18.240 --> 2:37:29.240]  And just those simple words were like a key sliding out of the lock and you turn it and the tumblers move and the door opens.
[2:37:29.240 --> 2:37:42.240]  And it was the baton fiery and old and scarred being headed to me and to you.
[2:37:42.240 --> 2:37:45.240]  And we hold the fire of human liberty.
[2:37:45.240 --> 2:37:52.240]  We hold the destiny of our entire future and things we can't even imagine in our hands.
[2:37:52.240 --> 2:38:00.240]  True Promethean fire and our enemies don't have that fire.
[2:38:00.240 --> 2:38:03.240]  They chose Satan.
[2:38:03.240 --> 2:38:05.240]  They chose the devil.
[2:38:05.240 --> 2:38:08.240]  They chose damnation.
[2:38:08.240 --> 2:38:25.240]  They chose to be cut off from their families and their ancestors and the future.
[2:38:25.240 --> 2:38:39.240]  My grandmother told me that only a death of the secrets reveal.
[2:38:39.240 --> 2:38:53.240]  This quest is not just our quest but the blood of our ancestors and their will to survive and to create beauty.
[2:38:53.240 --> 2:38:56.240]  And what beautiful souls they are.
[2:38:56.240 --> 2:39:04.240]  And they're around us right now with the angels and the Elohim.
[2:39:04.240 --> 2:39:12.240]  And this great experiment that we live today that we experience together is eternal.
[2:39:12.240 --> 2:39:15.240]  And the enemies of God will never overcome us.
[2:39:15.240 --> 2:39:22.240]  They will never break our will unless they can convince us that we don't have this birth.
[2:39:22.240 --> 2:39:27.240]  We don't have this birthright and unless we decide to reject this birthright.
[2:39:27.240 --> 2:39:32.240]  But we don't reject the birthright of Christ.
[2:39:32.240 --> 2:39:40.240]  We receive it and the persecution that comes with it.
[2:39:40.240 --> 2:39:48.240]  And we receive the promise of the quiet place, the Most High of King David.
[2:39:48.240 --> 2:39:51.240]  And we enter that quiet place of the Most High.
[2:39:51.240 --> 2:39:56.240]  We enter that place beyond the veil.
[2:39:56.240 --> 2:40:05.240]  And we take in our hands the destiny of our species and the magnificent victory that we've been given.
[2:40:05.240 --> 2:40:13.240]  And we receive it as this precious birthright, this gift in our hands.
[2:40:13.240 --> 2:40:17.240]  And we salute God for giving us consciousness and God's perfection.
[2:40:17.240 --> 2:40:36.240]  And we submit to God's will and commit to give everything we've got to defend the innocence and to take our species to the next level.
[2:40:36.240 --> 2:40:39.240]  There are about to kill millions of people.
[2:40:39.240 --> 2:40:41.240]  It's foretold.
[2:40:41.240 --> 2:40:43.240]  It's forwritten.
[2:40:43.240 --> 2:40:45.240]  It's been prophesied.
[2:40:45.240 --> 2:40:49.240]  And it's our job to try to stop it.
[2:40:49.240 --> 2:40:53.240]  And we will mitigate it and we will reduce it.
[2:40:53.240 --> 2:41:04.240]  But billions, at least two to three million will die soon.
[2:41:04.240 --> 2:41:22.240]  Because prophecy will be fulfilled. But out of that comes the new era and the Type 1 civilization are launching the cosmos and the breaking of the interdimensional gates and the next level of our development.
[2:41:22.240 --> 2:41:26.240]  And it will not be Satan that captains human development to the next level.
[2:41:26.240 --> 2:41:38.240]  It will be the Holy Spirit of God that brings us to the completion of this phase of our operations.
[2:41:38.240 --> 2:41:43.240]  I am here, just as you are, to complete the operation.
[2:41:43.240 --> 2:41:45.240]  We're going interstellar.
[2:41:45.240 --> 2:41:48.240]  We're going intergalactic.
[2:41:48.240 --> 2:41:50.240]  We're going interdimensional.
[2:41:50.240 --> 2:41:52.240]  And no one can stop that.
[2:41:52.240 --> 2:41:59.240]  And the Yuval Noah Harare's and the Klaus Schwab's and the Bill Gates can pretend to be God.
[2:41:59.240 --> 2:42:02.240]  They can pretend to be in control.
[2:42:02.240 --> 2:42:09.240]  They can pretend that they're governing our future, but they're fools.
[2:42:09.240 --> 2:42:13.240]  And they will not ever pass the River Jordan.
[2:42:13.240 --> 2:42:18.240]  They will never go into the Promised Land.
[2:42:18.240 --> 2:42:21.240]  And many of us will not enter the Promised Land as well.
[2:42:21.240 --> 2:42:24.240]  I will never enter the Promised Land.
[2:42:24.240 --> 2:42:53.240]  But I will mark the way as you do now for our children and their children and their children's children to enter the Promised Land.
[2:42:58.240 --> 2:43:06.240]  The globalists are doing everything they can to destroy heterosexual relationships, to annihilate the family, to split up marriages.
[2:43:06.240 --> 2:43:15.240]  And if you look at the studies, the number one cause of marriages breaking up is the fact that the men cannot satisfy their women in the bedroom.
[2:43:15.240 --> 2:43:17.240]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:43:17.240 --> 2:43:24.240]  And even if you're like me and hardly ever have a problem, I mean, all of us, one point, another two, that's just the truth.
[2:43:24.240 --> 2:43:26.240]  The liberals will make fun of that, but everybody knows that's true.

[2:47:21.240 --> 2:47:27.240]  We break the silence, breaking from the given light
[2:47:27.240 --> 2:47:42.240]  Dengue sick boy lean, he's returned to kill the lights,ouvend when he's down behind the musics won't help
[2:47:42.240 --> 2:47:54.240]  All right, folks, takin Plough need from E 물berg's frisbee
[2:47:54.240 --> 2:48:00.360]  You know, I said I had all this serotonin rib taking inhibitor nose.
[2:48:00.360 --> 2:48:04.880]  I said I had all this COVID nose and I probably should cover that, but you can talk five hours
[2:48:04.880 --> 2:48:05.880]  about it.
[2:48:05.880 --> 2:48:06.880]  Ten hours, 100 hours.
[2:48:06.880 --> 2:48:10.460]  I mean, it's just so insane how they're attacking us now they're killing us.
[2:48:10.460 --> 2:48:11.960]  Look at this.
[2:48:11.960 --> 2:48:17.960]  A major new study is casting serious doubts on degrees of belief regarding the chemical
[2:48:17.960 --> 2:48:22.320]  and balance theory of depression.
[2:48:22.320 --> 2:48:27.880]  And it's not caused by low serotonin levels, major international study looking at dozens
[2:48:27.880 --> 2:48:35.160]  of other studies, 17 other studies, exclusive CDC shielding names of employees working
[2:48:35.160 --> 2:48:36.160]  on vaccine safety.
[2:48:36.160 --> 2:48:38.040]  Yeah, they better be protected.
[2:48:38.040 --> 2:48:43.560]  German government admits COVID vaccines cause serious injury for one in 5000, but its own
[2:48:43.560 --> 2:48:49.880]  data shows the rate is really one in 300 doses.
[2:48:49.880 --> 2:48:51.480]  And it goes on from there.
[2:48:51.480 --> 2:48:54.360]  CNN and time.
[2:48:54.360 --> 2:48:57.960]  You'll need to get the COVID-19 booster shots again and again.
[2:48:57.960 --> 2:49:00.360]  Told you two and a half years ago that was coming.
[2:49:00.360 --> 2:49:05.960]  It was all baked in Aussie research is developing super jab to protect against new COVID variants.
[2:49:05.960 --> 2:49:13.920]  Oh, what Bill Gates said, partnership develop variant proof COVID vaccine.
[2:49:13.920 --> 2:49:14.920]  Just take more and more.
[2:49:14.920 --> 2:49:15.920]  It'll protect you.
[2:49:15.920 --> 2:49:16.920]  You're an idiot.
[2:49:16.920 --> 2:49:20.520]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[2:49:20.520 --> 2:49:21.520]  Yes.
[2:49:21.520 --> 2:49:22.520]  In Virginia here on here.
[2:49:22.520 --> 2:49:23.520]  Thanks for holding.
[2:49:23.520 --> 2:49:24.520]  Yeah.
[2:49:24.520 --> 2:49:26.520]  Thanks for taking my call.
[2:49:26.520 --> 2:49:32.720]  Alex, great show, by the way, um, I have a question and a comment, a question about
[2:49:32.720 --> 2:49:37.440]  the left, right paradigm and a comment on zero point energy.
[2:49:37.440 --> 2:49:42.640]  And you know, in the last, I would say six years, and you've seen this, the polarity
[2:49:42.640 --> 2:49:47.520]  is really widened with within the left, right paradigm.
[2:49:47.520 --> 2:49:51.480]  When you've mentioned this and many others have mentioned this, we need to remember that
[2:49:51.480 --> 2:49:59.200]  narrowing that polarity is the key to creating a catalyst for a substantial response to clear
[2:49:59.200 --> 2:50:01.200]  and present tyranny.
[2:50:01.200 --> 2:50:07.160]  And what are your thoughts about reducing that polarity amid this country's false left
[2:50:07.160 --> 2:50:10.880]  right paradigm and people better figure out the globalists are turning this against each
[2:50:10.880 --> 2:50:14.360]  other for control and while we fight with each other, they're ruling us.
[2:50:14.360 --> 2:50:15.360]  I mean, it's that simple.
[2:50:15.360 --> 2:50:20.480]  Right, but the rest of the question is, well, you know, how do we bring people together
[2:50:20.480 --> 2:50:25.880]  and reinforce that we essentially have the same viewpoints?
[2:50:25.880 --> 2:50:28.240]  Well we expose the carbon taxes as a fraud.
[2:50:28.240 --> 2:50:32.160]  We expose the elites, don't follow their own carbon tax rules.
[2:50:32.160 --> 2:50:34.200]  And we point out the electric cars don't work.
[2:50:34.200 --> 2:50:38.480]  They cause more energy than fuel gas driven cars.
[2:50:38.480 --> 2:50:42.720]  And I mean, it is basically just people need to know the common sense facts out there that
[2:50:42.720 --> 2:50:47.560]  they're not being given a solution as a new system, they're being given a collapse.
[2:50:47.560 --> 2:50:53.280]  Right, there's no viable replacement right now that they're putting forward and that's
[2:50:53.280 --> 2:50:57.680]  a huge red flag to everyone looking at this collapse.
[2:50:57.680 --> 2:51:03.400]  But okay, regarding zero point energy and getting it into the hands of the public, there are
[2:51:03.400 --> 2:51:04.400]  inventors.
[2:51:04.400 --> 2:51:07.080]  You know, they're suppressing a lot of amazing technologies.
[2:51:07.080 --> 2:51:09.280]  Yeah, they're inventors in this country.
[2:51:09.280 --> 2:51:13.280]  They're filing patents for zero point energy devices and that puts a target on them.
[2:51:13.280 --> 2:51:17.680]  But instead, and I know money is an issue, but reproduce that device and get it into
[2:51:17.680 --> 2:51:22.680]  the hands of many trusted engineers as possible and just start reproducing it.
[2:51:22.680 --> 2:51:25.120]  Now John Hutchison, you probably know about him.
[2:51:25.120 --> 2:51:29.080]  He created those brick sized batteries that when you connect several together they can
[2:51:29.080 --> 2:51:30.560]  power your home.
[2:51:30.560 --> 2:51:34.560]  The Japanese were very interested in this and but he said there was little interest in
[2:51:34.560 --> 2:51:35.560]  the U.S.
[2:51:35.560 --> 2:51:42.080]  And there's a guy in Canada named Dr. Paulo Correa and Bill Gates and George Sarris refused
[2:51:42.080 --> 2:51:45.320]  to fund his zero point energy devices.
[2:51:45.320 --> 2:51:49.080]  He was a colleague of Dr. Eugene Malov and Dr. Correa.
[2:51:49.080 --> 2:51:52.440]  There's no doubt there's a suppressing technology brother, great points.
[2:51:52.440 --> 2:51:53.920]  Thank you so much, Jeff.
[2:51:53.920 --> 2:51:57.640]  Victor in New Mexico, Victor here on the air, then Carlos in Canada.
[2:51:57.640 --> 2:51:58.640]  Go ahead, Victor.
[2:51:58.640 --> 2:52:01.880]  Hey, Alex, I've been wanting to talk to you for a long time about this.
[2:52:01.880 --> 2:52:06.720]  I wrote this down a couple of years ago and I'll start with a rhetorical question, not
[2:52:06.720 --> 2:52:07.720]  trying to sound smart.
[2:52:07.720 --> 2:52:14.000]  You can try to answer it if you want, but it's what do Nelson Mandela, Adolf Hitler,
[2:52:14.000 --> 2:52:19.320]  Aiman Devallera from Ireland, Mahatma Gandhi and Andrew Jackson all have in common.
[2:52:19.320 --> 2:52:22.240]  They were all connected to British intelligence.
[2:52:22.240 --> 2:52:23.720]  Well that's not where I was going.
[2:52:23.720 --> 2:52:27.360]  I was going in the fact that they were all political prisoners and you can put Tommy
[2:52:27.360 --> 2:52:34.440]  Robinson in there too, who came out stronger and I really fear for you, man, that eventually
[2:52:34.440 --> 2:52:38.200]  they're going to catch up with you and they're going to put you in jail for some trumped
[2:52:38.200 --> 2:52:43.760]  up reason and what I want to impart to you is when they do it, take that time away from
[2:52:43.760 --> 2:52:50.320]  the battlefield to get stronger like those men in history did, these political men that
[2:52:50.320 --> 2:52:55.720]  spent that time in jail away from the battle and finally able to stop reacting and start
[2:52:55.720 --> 2:53:00.080]  planning and I'm not saying these were good people or bad people, I mean, well Hitler
[2:53:00.080 --> 2:53:04.840]  bad, but it's just something that's been on my mind a long time.
[2:53:04.840 --> 2:53:09.040]  They're going to get you, I think, at some point for some trumped up reason and I want
[2:53:09.040 --> 2:53:11.720]  to know if you're prepared to spend that time wisely.
[2:53:11.720 --> 2:53:16.960]  I'm going to try my best, brother, but you're absolutely right there trying to put me in
[2:53:16.960 --> 2:53:17.960]  prison.
[2:53:17.960 --> 2:53:18.960]  That's a good point.
[2:53:18.960 --> 2:53:19.960]  Thank you so much for the call.
[2:53:19.960 --> 2:53:21.440]  Carlos in Canada, you're on the air.
[2:53:21.440 --> 2:53:22.440]  Thanks for holding.
[2:53:22.440 --> 2:53:23.440]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:53:23.440 --> 2:53:29.360]  The greatest contribution that Infowars has made over the years is that it's enlightened
[2:53:29.360 --> 2:53:32.400]  people, it has given people a sense of discernment.
[2:53:32.400 --> 2:53:37.120]  I can tell from the calls and the callers over the months since I've been calling you
[2:53:37.120 --> 2:53:42.800]  and I can tell you that that is to me the greatest contribution that you have made.
[2:53:42.800 --> 2:53:47.800]  Now, if anybody touches Alex Jones, there'll be a lot of Alex Jones out there just like
[2:53:47.800 --> 2:53:52.080]  Dr. Zelenko's gone, but in my mind he's still here, he's in our hearts.
[2:53:52.080 --> 2:54:01.000]  So I really want to tell you, Alex, briefly, there is a reason why Mr. Yuval Noah Harari
[2:54:01.000 --> 2:54:03.640]  is the advisor to Klaus Schwab.
[2:54:03.640 --> 2:54:10.080]  He's a history professor of medieval history and you need an expert in feudalism if you're
[2:54:10.080 --> 2:54:14.720]  going to be really appreciated in what they have in mind for the American people and for
[2:54:14.720 --> 2:54:15.720]  the rest of the world.
[2:54:15.720 --> 2:54:16.720]  That's right.
[2:54:16.720 --> 2:54:17.720]  It's the new feudalism.
[2:54:17.720 --> 2:54:19.720]  That's what Gen 21 is.
[2:54:19.720 --> 2:54:25.160]  Yes, but there is a way to cancel all this and that is through discernment.
[2:54:25.160 --> 2:54:30.480]  And again, I bring something to your attention, to broaden the mind, okay?
[2:54:30.480 --> 2:54:34.880]  When you go into the stores and your street and sometimes into your backyard or you go
[2:54:34.880 --> 2:54:41.000]  through your driveway, you step on ants and you step on them and you feel bad because
[2:54:41.000 --> 2:54:45.720]  you're like, oh my foot just stepped on a few ants, sorry they were in their path.
[2:54:45.720 --> 2:54:48.600]  But you don't twist your life around it.
[2:54:48.600 --> 2:54:53.480]  Well, when corporations get to the point that they're larger than life, the administrators
[2:54:53.480 --> 2:54:59.440]  of these huge colossal entities find the little people many, many times, little government,
[2:54:59.440 --> 2:55:04.960]  little nuisances, inconveniences that they have to deal with and they step on them without
[2:55:04.960 --> 2:55:05.960]  even noticing.
[2:55:05.960 --> 2:55:10.280]  That's what I'm trying to make the point that we're not little ants.
[2:55:10.280 --> 2:55:16.280]  And when the formula that the Florida governor, the scientist has put on saying, hey, who are
[2:55:16.280 --> 2:55:20.400]  you unelected people telling us what to do, forget it, we're not going to do anything
[2:55:20.400 --> 2:55:22.760]  whatever the World Economic Forum wants to do.
[2:55:22.760 --> 2:55:27.960]  No more of these conjobs about, you know, viruses, nobody gets cold anymore, Alex.
[2:55:27.960 --> 2:55:31.160]  Now you get variants.
[2:55:31.160 --> 2:55:32.160]  You're right.
[2:55:32.160 --> 2:55:33.160]  So what do you think is going to come next?
[2:55:33.160 --> 2:55:37.280]  Well, what I think is going to come next is that there's going to be a worldwide recognition.
[2:55:37.280 --> 2:55:42.360]  Beginning with President Putin, you don't realize in the last few days, he's been saying
[2:55:42.360 --> 2:55:48.200]  tremendous things about great revolution coming, that the individual sovereign countries will
[2:55:48.200 --> 2:55:52.760]  stand on their own, defending their people, bringing the best out of people and bringing
[2:55:52.760 --> 2:55:53.760]  the best people forward.
[2:55:53.760 --> 2:55:57.600]  This is a new era and a new stage in the world history is happening.
[2:55:57.600 --> 2:55:58.600]  Yes.
[2:55:58.600 --> 2:56:02.240]  And when we do that, I mean, last year I was in the program with you and I tell you the
[2:56:02.240 --> 2:56:07.200]  secret lies in looking at your children and bringing the best out of the children.
[2:56:07.200 --> 2:56:09.240]  Let them compete for excellence.
[2:56:09.240 --> 2:56:13.360]  The leadership will come from there, not from someone elected official of Klaus Schwab
[2:56:13.360 --> 2:56:17.920]  that once had a meeting with Rockefeller and Maurice Strong, the Canadian, and they said,
[2:56:17.920 --> 2:56:22.320]  hey, set up the World Economic Forum and we can get leaders and infiltrate everywhere.
[2:56:22.320 --> 2:56:26.400]  We have an election in Quebec here in the fall, in the provincial government.
[2:56:26.400 --> 2:56:31.280]  I can tell you people already from the World Economic Forum are candidates.
[2:56:31.280 --> 2:56:33.800]  I mean, it is insane.
[2:56:33.800 --> 2:56:34.800]  They want to go.
[2:56:34.800 --> 2:56:37.760]  Well, Trudeau, as you know, you're in Canada, is like 30% of the vote.
[2:56:37.760 --> 2:56:39.560]  He's barely holding on to power.
[2:56:39.560 --> 2:56:40.640]  People are rejecting him.
[2:56:40.640 --> 2:56:41.640]  That's good news.
[2:56:41.640 --> 2:56:42.640]  Yes.
[2:56:42.640 --> 2:56:43.640]  Yes.
[2:56:43.640 --> 2:56:48.280]  World Economic Forum and breastfed leaders turn out to be not so good after all.
[2:56:48.280 --> 2:56:50.480]  You realize that?
[2:56:50.480 --> 2:56:51.880]  Thank you so much, Carlos.
[2:56:51.880 --> 2:56:52.880]  All right.
[2:56:52.880 --> 2:56:55.000]  We'll do five more minutes.
[2:56:55.000 --> 2:57:01.240]  I'll try to jam in Mark and a few other callers and hold the longest when we come back.
[2:57:01.240 --> 2:57:03.240]  Thank you for keeping us on air, listeners.
[2:57:03.240 --> 2:57:04.240]  Thanks for supporting us.
[2:57:04.240 --> 2:57:05.760]  Thanks for all you've done.
[2:57:05.760 --> 2:57:10.840]  I mean, it really is a crazy moment right now where world government and depopulation
[2:57:10.840 --> 2:57:15.680]  and then and everything is just out in the open.
[2:57:15.680 --> 2:57:19.920]  Now it's up to us to make the right choice about the future of our species.
[2:57:19.920 --> 2:57:25.680]  Then Paul Joseph Watson in the fourth hour is taking over ahead of the war room, 3 p.m.
[2:57:25.680 --> 2:57:30.800]  Central and infowars.com or slash show and Bandai video.

[3:00:30.320 --> 3:00:36.520]  I just wanted to highlight something, one of your previous callers had mentioned there's
[3:00:36.520 --> 3:00:42.240]  a video called the officer weighs in on Ubaldi's video and his name is Jared Reston and he
[3:00:42.240 --> 3:00:49.520]  looks like Eric Paddock, the Las Vegas shooters, alleged brother.
[3:00:49.520 --> 3:00:52.680]  I've heard that twice today, I haven't looked at it yet.
[3:00:52.680 --> 3:00:57.000]  You got to check out the video, man.
[3:00:57.000 --> 3:00:59.000]  I will.
[3:00:59.000 --> 3:01:06.760]  What, are you scared by any chance when you're out here seeing, exposing these things, do
[3:01:06.760 --> 3:01:11.840]  you have any fear that maybe you're going to get a, I don't know, maybe like visited
[3:01:11.840 --> 3:01:12.840]  by somebody or something?
[3:01:12.840 --> 3:01:17.000]  No, I mean, I'm worried about losing to the new world order.
[3:01:17.000 --> 3:01:19.360]  No, I'm not worried about myself.
[3:01:19.360 --> 3:01:20.360]  Really I'm not.
[3:01:20.360 --> 3:01:21.360]  That's good, brother.
[3:01:21.360 --> 3:01:22.360]  All right, thanks, man.
[3:01:22.360 --> 3:01:23.360]  I appreciate your call.
[3:01:23.360 --> 3:01:29.200]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[3:01:29.200 --> 3:01:31.360]  Dustin in Florida, go ahead, Dustin.
[3:01:31.360 --> 3:01:38.400]  Yeah, I want to say thank you, Alex, and Imple Wars for everything you guys do, for trying
[3:01:38.400 --> 3:01:44.920]  to wake people up, I wanted to speak to truck drivers out there, whether you're old or young,
[3:01:44.920 --> 3:01:50.560]  you need to get away from the mega carriers to have these cameras and sensors on them.
[3:01:50.560 --> 3:01:57.040]  You need to get on Craig's list and start driving for these small mom and pop.
[3:01:57.040 --> 3:01:58.040]  I agree.
[3:01:58.040 --> 3:02:04.040]  Everybody should try to pick mom and pop truck drivers for any shipping you need.
[3:02:04.040 --> 3:02:05.040]  Exactly.
[3:02:05.040 --> 3:02:10.360]  And we're programming, what they're doing is they're programming the system for those
[3:02:10.360 --> 3:02:16.040]  trucks to take over all those centers on your truck, the cameras, they're programming everything.
[3:02:16.040 --> 3:02:18.200]  They're training the self driving cars.
[3:02:18.200 --> 3:02:25.680]  Yeah, we are programming the system that will take, take it away, take our jobs away,
[3:02:25.680 --> 3:02:31.320]  you know, go, go with small mom and pop trucking companies, you know.
[3:02:31.320 --> 3:02:35.080]  I agree, brother, what else is on your mind?
[3:02:35.080 --> 3:02:40.800]  Yeah, I just, when I'm driving out here, you know, I find it kind of, kind of interesting
[3:02:40.800 --> 3:02:46.520]  that they've been working on certain, certain places coming into every major city.
[3:02:46.520 --> 3:02:50.200]  It seems like they bottle neck you into one lane.
[3:02:50.200 --> 3:02:55.680]  It's almost like they're preparing to maybe some kind of checkpoints, and this has been
[3:02:55.680 --> 3:02:57.680]  happening for a long time.
[3:02:57.680 --> 3:03:03.000]  Well, they're putting up wire fences on the Texas highways in between the roads everywhere.
[3:03:03.000 --> 3:03:04.120]  You're damn right, Dustin.
[3:03:04.120 --> 3:03:05.120]  Thank you.
[3:03:05.120 --> 3:03:08.440]  Last caller for this segment, David in Texas on Trump and DeSantis.
[3:03:08.440 --> 3:03:09.440]  Go ahead.
[3:03:09.440 --> 3:03:10.440]  Hey, Alex Jones.
[3:03:10.440 --> 3:03:11.440]  How you doing, brother?
[3:03:11.440 --> 3:03:12.440]  Good, brother.
[3:03:12.440 --> 3:03:13.440]  Go ahead.
[3:03:13.440 --> 3:03:23.360]  I just want to say Trump and DeSantis gets in there, we'll get it back straight, I believe.
[3:03:23.360 --> 3:03:32.080]  And I just, I love you, man, and I'll get you shirts and stuff, and the stickers I get,
[3:03:32.080 --> 3:03:33.080]  I'll put them everywhere.
[3:03:33.080 --> 3:03:40.240]  When I'm in St. Anton, everywhere I go, well, he's a sticker, can't do much, but I spread
[3:03:40.240 --> 3:03:41.240]  the word.
[3:03:41.240 --> 3:03:42.680]  That's a big thing, brother.
[3:03:42.680 --> 3:03:45.720]  All that stuff adds up beautiful.
[3:03:45.720 --> 3:03:50.560]  And just take care, like I said, man, we're going to win.
[3:03:50.560 --> 3:03:52.040]  God bless you.
[3:03:52.040 --> 3:03:53.040]  Thank you.
[3:03:53.040 --> 3:03:56.640]  Mark in Florida and Sean in Florida.
[3:03:56.640 --> 3:03:57.640]  I'm out of time.
[3:03:57.640 --> 3:03:58.640]  Appreciate you holding.
[3:03:58.640 --> 3:04:02.200]  If you guys remember tomorrow, we'll call them back, put them first on the show, on the
[3:04:02.200 --> 3:04:03.520]  Friday show, we take calls.
[3:04:03.520 --> 3:04:11.920]  But Paul Joseph Watson from her Britannic Majesties, England, is about to take over on
[3:04:11.920 --> 3:04:12.920]  the other side.
[3:04:12.920 --> 3:04:18.960]  Then in 55 minutes, Owen Schreuer and the War Room, I want to thank the Lester's for
[3:04:18.960 --> 3:04:19.960]  their support.
[3:04:19.960 --> 3:04:22.480]  I want to thank the crew for their great work.
[3:04:22.480 --> 3:04:23.920]  I want to thank all of our affiliates.
[3:04:23.920 --> 3:04:28.160]  I want to ask you all to go to M4store.com, get an Alex Shields' right T-shirt, get
[3:04:28.160 --> 3:04:30.360]  bodies, get the new diet force.
[3:04:30.360 --> 3:04:34.320]  We got the 50% off on the toothpaste deal going right now.
[3:04:34.320 --> 3:04:35.320]  It's a big deal.
[3:04:35.320 --> 3:04:37.000]  That keeps us on air.
[3:04:37.000 --> 3:04:38.560]  Thank you all for your support.
[3:04:38.560 --> 3:04:39.880]  All right.
[3:04:39.880 --> 3:04:41.360]  You live, you learn.
[3:04:41.360 --> 3:04:45.320]  Paul Joseph Watson takes over on the other side of this quick break.
[3:04:45.320 --> 3:04:57.400]  Summit dot news.
[3:04:57.400 --> 3:05:02.440]  We brought the game-changing product previously only available to major oil companies around
[3:05:02.440 --> 3:05:08.240]  the world to the civilian market two years ago, the BioProse, for septic tanks, for port-a-potties,
[3:05:08.240 --> 3:05:10.760]  for RVs, for your drains, your boats.
[3:05:10.760 --> 3:05:11.760]  It goes on and on.
[3:05:11.760 --> 3:05:15.300]  It'll eat the oil off of your driveway if you just add water.
[3:05:15.300 --> 3:05:21.120]  But it's been so successful now, we're selling it to major RV parks, pig farms, you name
[3:05:21.120 --> 3:05:26.440]  it, because this stuff will eat anything that is organic.
[3:05:26.440 --> 3:05:32.840]  And it's exclusively available at theBioProse.com and now M4store.com.
[3:05:32.840 --> 3:05:38.160]  We sold out of this for almost a year, but we made a major purchase and it is now in
[3:05:38.160 --> 3:05:41.120]  stock for whatever your need is at M4store.com.
[3:05:41.120 --> 3:05:48.440]  You'll also find instructional videos and more information at M4store.com or theBioProse.com.
[3:05:48.440 --> 3:05:52.240]  Made in America, powered by God's great creation.
[3:05:52.240 --> 3:06:22.080]  It is amazing and it funds the M4Warm.
[3:06:27.080 --> 3:06:35.440]  President Joe Biden, quadruple back, and Covid positive, of course, he wears a mask most
[3:06:35.440 --> 3:06:36.440]  of the time.
[3:06:36.440 --> 3:06:42.280]  He's protected in his little bubble by his White House apparatchiks, but yes, the president
[3:06:42.280 --> 3:06:48.880]  has succumbed to Covid and now he's being treated with Paxlovid, the same drug that
[3:06:48.880 --> 3:06:55.280]  was given to Dr. Anthony Fauci, also quadruple vaccinated and Covid positive, and then of
[3:06:55.280 --> 3:07:01.080]  course, Anthony Fauci tested positive again for Covid in the second time in the space
[3:07:01.080 --> 3:07:02.080]  of a fortnight.
[3:07:02.080 --> 3:07:12.080]  But again, the vaccines 100% safe and effective, okay, okay, if you say it isn't all the consequences.
[3:07:12.080 --> 3:07:18.000]  Joe Biden, who told Americans last year, you're not going to get Covid if you have these vaccinations.
[3:07:18.000 --> 3:07:22.960]  Yes, he said that during a CNN town hall, back when the media was still running with
[3:07:22.960 --> 3:07:30.520]  that narrative, has just tested positive for Covid after having had four, count them, four
[3:07:30.520 --> 3:07:35.560]  100% safe and effective vaccinations.
[3:07:35.560 --> 3:07:39.720]  Statement by White House Press Secretary, Kareem Jean-Pierre.
[3:07:39.720 --> 3:07:44.960]  This morning, President Biden tested positive for Covid-19, he is fully vaccinated and twice
[3:07:44.960 --> 3:07:49.000]  boosted and experiencing very mild symptoms.
[3:07:49.000 --> 3:07:53.000]  I guess we should just be grateful, or at least the Biden White House should be, that
[3:07:53.000 --> 3:07:58.280]  he hasn't got cancer, as he told us yesterday, and he's just got Covid.
[3:07:58.280 --> 3:08:02.320]  So again, the same guy that told Americans last year, quote, you're not going to get
[3:08:02.320 --> 3:08:06.000]  Covid if you have these vaccinations.
[3:08:06.000 --> 3:08:13.120]  The same person who said this year, back in early January, 4th of January, quote, this
[3:08:13.120 --> 3:08:16.520]  continues to be a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[3:08:16.520 --> 3:08:24.120]  Well, at the moment, it's a pandemic of the vaccinated, including Anthony Fauci and indeed
[3:08:24.120 --> 3:08:27.080]  Joe Biden.
[3:08:27.080 --> 3:08:33.320]  So Biden's got Covid and we see the momentum building once again, exactly as I predicted,
[3:08:33.320 --> 3:08:39.440]  with the CDC coming out and saying that restrictions may have to be brought back, with Seattle,
[3:08:39.440 --> 3:08:44.640]  with New York, with California, preparing to reintroduce mask mandates.
[3:08:44.640 --> 3:08:48.640]  The technocrats are not finished with this virus.
[3:08:48.640 --> 3:08:53.320]  We all thought it was done and dusted back at the start of spring.
[3:08:53.320 --> 3:08:54.320]  No, no, no, no.
[3:08:54.320 --> 3:08:56.360]  They got drunk on power.
[3:08:56.360 --> 3:08:58.600]  Most people complied.
[3:08:58.600 --> 3:09:01.800]  Most people were completely misled, completely brainwashed.
[3:09:01.800 --> 3:09:06.600]  They did polls showing the average American thought that it had killed something like
[3:09:06.600 --> 3:09:08.240]  30 million people.
[3:09:08.240 --> 3:09:12.520]  They're completely lacking in any critical thinking skills.
[3:09:12.520 --> 3:09:18.040]  The majority of people, I'm afraid to say, still are, and will bend down, will take the
[3:09:18.040 --> 3:09:24.040]  anal swab, probably at some point, will take the fifth booster, the sixth booster, the seventh
[3:09:24.040 --> 3:09:29.920]  booster, will put the mask back on, despite the fact that all the studies, all the evidence
[3:09:29.920 --> 3:09:36.320]  shows masks are completely useless or indeed exacerbate the problem.
[3:09:36.320 --> 3:09:43.120]  Germany has come out this week and said they're going to reintroduce mask mandates, not now.
[3:09:43.120 --> 3:09:47.920]  Even though they admit, quote, the COVID summer wave is losing momentum, the summer wave
[3:09:47.920 --> 3:09:52.960]  being the sniffles, I've had this latest variant of COVID.
[3:09:52.960 --> 3:09:54.720]  I had it about a month ago.
[3:09:54.720 --> 3:09:57.080]  I've had worse colds.
[3:09:57.080 --> 3:09:59.560]  It's been diluted to such a degree.
[3:09:59.560 --> 3:10:03.760]  It's literally less now than a cold in terms of severity for most people.
[3:10:03.760 --> 3:10:04.760]  Doesn't matter.
[3:10:04.760 --> 3:10:10.440]  It doesn't matter that the COVID cases are declining for the summer wave.
[3:10:10.440 --> 3:10:15.920]  Doesn't matter that they don't know what the COVID caseload will be in September, in six
[3:10:15.920 --> 3:10:17.160]  weeks' time.
[3:10:17.160 --> 3:10:21.400]  The German government has come out and they're drafting the law to make masks a permanent
[3:10:21.400 --> 3:10:22.400]  feature.
[3:10:22.400 --> 3:10:24.400]  Now, there's this big debate.
[3:10:24.400 --> 3:10:29.600]  Obviously, a lot of people on the right have devolved some kind of identity, just like
[3:10:29.600 --> 3:10:36.040]  people on the left, the mass freaks, the govern me harder crowd, govern me harder daddy, inject
[3:10:36.040 --> 3:10:42.120]  me harder daddy, have derived some sense of identity from this pandemic prolonging itself
[3:10:42.120 --> 3:10:43.120]  forevermore.
[3:10:43.120 --> 3:10:45.880]  Some people have done that on the right and some people within the right.
[3:10:45.880 --> 3:10:50.840]  There's been a bit of a fissure, a bit of a split by people saying, no, it's over, except
[3:10:50.840 --> 3:10:51.840]  it's over.
[3:10:51.840 --> 3:10:52.840]  Move on.
[3:10:52.840 --> 3:10:54.520]  There's no conspiracy to bring back lockdowns.
[3:10:54.520 --> 3:10:58.680]  There's no conspiracy to bring back all the restrictions, all the mask mandates.
[3:10:58.680 --> 3:11:05.640]  While Germany is doing it and they're enshrining the biosecurity police state into law, headline
[3:11:05.640 --> 3:11:12.960]  Germany to reimpose mask mandate in September, despite COVID wave already quote losing momentum.
[3:11:12.960 --> 3:11:18.640]  Justice Minister Marco Bushman announced Germans would have to mask up this autumn when indoors
[3:11:18.640 --> 3:11:25.280]  and that the rules would be in place throughout the winter, September, October, November,
[3:11:25.280 --> 3:11:28.800]  December, into January, February, March.
[3:11:28.800 --> 3:11:34.280]  They're saying they're not even going to restrict or relax them until the start of spring 2023.
[3:11:34.280 --> 3:11:40.160]  Again, not even knowing the caseload and knowing that every single variant has become
[3:11:40.160 --> 3:11:46.040]  milder and milder and milder doesn't matter.
[3:11:46.040 --> 3:11:48.400]  So we have them introducing mask mandates.
[3:11:48.400 --> 3:11:52.400]  They're going to pass this in parliament, looks like it's going to get through.
[3:11:52.400 --> 3:11:56.520]  Can we contrast New Zealand on Australia?
[3:11:56.520 --> 3:12:01.400]  Reports today that Australia is preparing to reintroduce mask mandates.
[3:12:01.400 --> 3:12:06.880]  Despite this headline, COVID infections and deaths in mask mandate New Zealand saw above
[3:12:06.880 --> 3:12:09.680]  those in mask free Australia.
[3:12:09.680 --> 3:12:15.480]  So here we have two very similar countries in terms of how they rolled out these pandemic
[3:12:15.480 --> 3:12:21.880]  lockdowns with absolute unrelenting brutality as we saw in New Zealand, as we saw in Australia
[3:12:21.880 --> 3:12:28.000]  with pregnant women, pregnant mothers being arrested in their own homes for merely criticising
[3:12:28.000 --> 3:12:30.280]  lockdown on Facebook.
[3:12:30.280 --> 3:12:36.480]  That's the level of the tyranny that we reached in Australia back at the end of 2020 into
[3:12:36.480 --> 3:12:37.480]  2021.
[3:12:37.480 --> 3:12:44.520]  But again, very similar hard core lockdown policies as New Zealand, yet you'll notice
[3:12:44.520 --> 3:12:51.080]  back at the end of last year coming into 2022, Australia dropped most of their mask mandates.
[3:12:51.080 --> 3:12:55.960]  They said you only had to wear them on public transport and in daycare centres, healthcare
[3:12:55.960 --> 3:12:57.920]  centres, hospitals.
[3:12:57.920 --> 3:12:59.000]  New Zealand didn't.
[3:12:59.000 --> 3:13:04.840]  They kept the mask mandates and now the data is explained in a Daily Mail article.
[3:13:04.840 --> 3:13:09.440]  The astonishing data that may prove masks don't work, really, not like we've been saying
[3:13:09.440 --> 3:13:13.920]  this for two frigging years, all the media has just discovered it.
[3:13:13.920 --> 3:13:19.520]  Masks are mandatory everywhere in Singapore, another close country geographically, Kiwis
[3:13:19.520 --> 3:13:23.320]  are forced to wear them in all public indoor spaces.
[3:13:23.320 --> 3:13:26.760]  Australia mostly abandoned mask mandates and they are only still compulsory on public
[3:13:26.760 --> 3:13:27.760]  transport.
[3:13:27.760 --> 3:13:32.800]  As I said, however, both Singapore and New Zealand now have higher case numbers than
[3:13:32.800 --> 3:13:34.160]  Australia.
[3:13:34.160 --> 3:13:38.960]  We saw this in Wales, we saw it in Scotland, we saw it in Ireland.
[3:13:38.960 --> 3:13:44.520]  England dropped the mask mandates at the back end of Omicron Wave.
[3:13:44.520 --> 3:13:49.880]  In late January, Wales, Scotland, Ireland kept them, their case numbers continue going
[3:13:49.880 --> 3:13:50.960]  up.
[3:13:50.960 --> 3:13:53.360]  These masks make it worse.
[3:13:53.360 --> 3:13:58.400]  People are touching their faces, they're obsessively adjusting these masks.
[3:13:58.400 --> 3:14:01.200]  It looks like it's exacerbating the spread.
[3:14:01.200 --> 3:14:03.520]  There isn't a single study that proves otherwise.
[3:14:03.520 --> 3:14:09.360]  All the major studies, UK government's own study into mask restrictions in schools found
[3:14:09.360 --> 3:14:11.280]  they had no effect.
[3:14:11.280 --> 3:14:15.800]  The study by the Spanish government into mask mandates found they had no effect or made
[3:14:15.800 --> 3:14:17.640]  it worse.
[3:14:17.640 --> 3:14:23.720]  The study in Denmark, 6,000 people case study found that they had no effect.
[3:14:23.720 --> 3:14:29.320]  No study has found that they have any effect yet they're reintroduced over and over again.
[3:14:29.320 --> 3:14:34.600]  Now, in terms of the narrative, we've at last come to the point where we've discredited
[3:14:34.600 --> 3:14:40.840]  lockdown as a tool of fighting this pandemic, copying the brutal authoritarian Chinese Communist
[3:14:40.840 --> 3:14:41.840]  Party.
[3:14:41.840 --> 3:14:46.480]  Again, that took us what, the best part of two years to discredit that.
[3:14:46.480 --> 3:14:50.960]  Now at least they say, oh, we'll never go back to lockdowns, but we'll go back to masks.
[3:14:50.960 --> 3:14:54.520]  But that's been discredited over and over again.
[3:14:54.520 --> 3:14:56.600]  And we have another example.
[3:14:56.600 --> 3:15:01.320]  When you compare the case numbers with Australia and New Zealand, again, Australia dropping
[3:15:01.320 --> 3:15:03.960]  the mask, New Zealand keeping them in place.
[3:15:03.960 --> 3:15:08.680]  Then you compare the weekly confirmed COVID deaths per million people, look at the graph,
[3:15:08.680 --> 3:15:14.800]  New Zealand way higher after they dropped the mask mandates in Australia than Australia
[3:15:14.800 --> 3:15:15.800]  itself.
[3:15:15.800 --> 3:15:20.920]  The masks don't work, the data, the studies continually prove they don't work.
[3:15:20.920 --> 3:15:25.200]  The holes in the masks are far larger than the size of the virus itself.
[3:15:25.200 --> 3:15:26.840]  It goes straight through them.
[3:15:26.840 --> 3:15:27.840]  They don't work.
[3:15:27.840 --> 3:15:28.840]  They've never worked.
[3:15:28.840 --> 3:15:30.760]  They're probably going to make it worse.
[3:15:30.760 --> 3:15:35.640]  And when they reintroduce all these mask mandates, which they're now saying they're going to do,
[3:15:35.640 --> 3:15:41.600]  trying to do it in the UK, already having done it in many California schools, LA counties
[3:15:41.600 --> 3:15:46.120]  talking about doing it, Seattle's about to do it, they're going to do it, and it's going
[3:15:46.120 --> 3:15:48.560]  to make the caseload even worse.
[3:15:48.560 --> 3:15:57.240]  So then they're going to call for even more restrictions summit.news will be back.
[3:15:57.240 --> 3:16:07.000]  You have made history.
[3:16:07.000 --> 3:16:20.360]  Now, ladies and gentleman, two months ago, we announced we're blowing out of all of our
[3:16:20.360 --> 3:16:24.100]  designs of t shirts, some of which go back more than 25 years.
[3:16:24.100 --> 3:16:25.360]  All these shirts are limited edition.
[3:16:25.360 --> 3:16:29.560]  They are about to be history and will only exist in your closet, your drawer, or your
[3:16:29.560 --> 3:16:30.560]  wardrobe.
[3:16:30.560 --> 3:16:35.160]  So, there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left and a couple weeks they'll all
[3:16:35.160 --> 3:16:36.760]  be gone and they'll be history.
[3:16:36.760 --> 3:16:41.560]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[3:16:41.560 --> 3:16:43.400]  So thank you all for your support.

[3:16:53.080 --> 3:16:54.080]  infowarstore.com.
[3:16:54.080 --> 3:16:59.320]  If you're like myself and so many other people on this planet, especially as you get older,
[3:16:59.320 --> 3:17:01.320]  you gain weight, even if you eat a lot less.
[3:17:01.320 --> 3:17:06.040]  I've got to tell you, info wars is only about bringing you amazing products that really
[3:17:06.040 --> 3:17:07.040]  work.
[3:17:07.040 --> 3:17:10.440]  So we looked at the supplement market that we find a lot of our operations with and
[3:17:10.440 --> 3:17:16.800]  we said, what are the best selling natural, healthy, anti-fat weight loss products that
[3:17:16.800 --> 3:17:17.800]  are out there?
[3:17:17.800 --> 3:17:22.560]  We went and looked at the top 10 and they all had the same ingredients in common that
[3:17:22.560 --> 3:17:23.560]  is in this product.
[3:17:23.560 --> 3:17:31.120]  But with our new product from X7, Diet Force, we got the very best concentrates of these
[3:17:31.120 --> 3:17:36.000]  known natural essences that's just two amazing things for your body.

[3:19:57.440 --> 3:20:15.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:15.360 --> 3:20:24.280]  Live from the summit.news headquarters, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:20:24.280 --> 3:20:28.880]  Headline here out of London world, COVID-19 and I said they're going to bring this back
[3:20:28.880 --> 3:20:30.480]  and they're going to bring it back.
[3:20:30.480 --> 3:20:31.480]  They'll probably fail.
[3:20:31.480 --> 3:20:37.120]  There's a new poll out of Canada which shows that support for vaccine boosters and masks
[3:20:37.120 --> 3:20:42.680]  has completely collapsed so they're swimming against the tide basically.
[3:20:42.680 --> 3:20:47.600]  Headline now, COVID-19 London GP calls for return of face masks and says New variant
[3:20:47.600 --> 3:20:51.240]  is making people sicker.
[3:20:51.240 --> 3:20:52.240]  Absolutely incredible.
[3:20:52.240 --> 3:20:57.200]  COVID-19 is absolutely far from over as the virus will keep mutating and people seem to
[3:20:57.200 --> 3:21:00.760]  be sicker as London NHS GP has warned.
[3:21:00.760 --> 3:21:02.720]  Just a flagrant lie.
[3:21:02.720 --> 3:21:08.040]  You can look at the government's own numbers for deaths and hospitalizations.
[3:21:08.040 --> 3:21:13.520]  Not only are they massively lower than the first two waves, they're lower than the Omicron
[3:21:13.520 --> 3:21:16.240]  wave back in January.
[3:21:16.240 --> 3:21:20.960]  Fewer people on ventilators, fewer people going into hospital.
[3:21:20.960 --> 3:21:27.080]  So though they're not getting sicker, just outright made up crap from whole cloth to
[3:21:27.080 --> 3:21:29.600]  try and reintroduce all this BS.
[3:21:29.600 --> 3:21:35.360]  I'll tell you one thing that is making people sicker, something that's making healthy and
[3:21:35.360 --> 3:21:39.080]  fit athletes drop dead all over the world.
[3:21:39.080 --> 3:21:41.360]  Gee, wonder why that could be.
[3:21:41.360 --> 3:21:47.320]  Gateway Pundit reports, former offensive lineman for Notre Dame dies at 35 due to cardiac arrest
[3:21:47.320 --> 3:21:49.480]  while on a run.
[3:21:49.480 --> 3:21:53.720]  One minute, healthy 35 year old guy on a jog.
[3:21:53.720 --> 3:21:55.200]  Next minute, bang, he's dead.
[3:21:55.200 --> 3:21:58.200]  Gee, I wonder what happened.
[3:21:58.200 --> 3:22:02.600]  Former Notre Dame offensive lineman Paul Emmett Duncan, the third known as Paul Duncan, was
[3:22:02.600 --> 3:22:06.720]  35, died of a heart attack when he was out for a run in his neighborhood on Friday according
[3:22:06.720 --> 3:22:07.720]  to his wife.
[3:22:07.720 --> 3:22:11.160]  Death remains unexplained.
[3:22:11.160 --> 3:22:18.520]  Also something that remains unexplained, we now have 9,500 non-COVID excess deaths in
[3:22:18.520 --> 3:22:22.040]  the United Kingdom over the last 11 weeks.
[3:22:22.040 --> 3:22:28.360]  Now bear in mind, we had the media over the past few days hyperventilating over some hot
[3:22:28.360 --> 3:22:34.320]  weather in summer in the United Kingdom, I'm going to get onto that later, caused basically
[3:22:34.320 --> 3:22:35.320]  no deaths.
[3:22:35.320 --> 3:22:39.920]  There were some tragic accidents where people went swimming and drowned, which happens every
[3:22:39.920 --> 3:22:40.920]  summer.
[3:22:40.920 --> 3:22:49.640]  And that was hyperventilation levels of hysteria, 9,500 people dying from unexplained non-COVID
[3:22:49.640 --> 3:22:56.320]  deaths, excess deaths over the usual amount in the last 11 weeks, nobody's even talking
[3:22:56.320 --> 3:22:57.960]  about it.
[3:22:57.960 --> 3:23:06.600]  DailySkeptic.org says there have been 9,422 more deaths than usual registered in England
[3:23:06.600 --> 3:23:12.440]  and Wales from causes other than COVID-19 in the 11 weeks since April 23rd.
[3:23:12.440 --> 3:23:16.800]  Now they put up a graph here, and bear in mind, a lot of these deaths are because of
[3:23:16.800 --> 3:23:21.960]  lockdown, because people were denied appointments with their GPs.
[3:23:21.960 --> 3:23:27.080]  Even after the lockdown was over, even now, you can only get an appointment with a GP
[3:23:27.080 --> 3:23:29.840]  over Zoom, it's pathetic.
[3:23:29.840 --> 3:23:34.520]  They've denied treatment for serious medical conditions, they're dying in their thousands
[3:23:34.520 --> 3:23:40.040]  upon thousands, not because of the pandemic, because of the lockdown.
[3:23:40.040 --> 3:23:44.120]  They've also got an interesting graph here, which I've talked about before, where they
[3:23:44.120 --> 3:23:53.280]  overlay non-COVID excess deaths by occurrence in the over 75 age group in England, and it
[3:23:53.280 --> 3:23:59.440]  weirdly match, it weirdly tracks another element, which is spring boosters, which were given
[3:23:59.440 --> 3:24:10.240]  to over 75s in England, starting at the end of March, tailing off the Covid-19 pandemic.
[3:24:10.240 --> 3:24:14.320]  Until they try to bring back all the corona restrictions, a new reason for everyone to
[3:24:14.320 --> 3:24:18.800]  be cowering inside their homes, terrified, has now been discovered.
[3:24:18.800 --> 3:24:21.000]  It's called summer.
[3:24:21.000 --> 3:24:25.280]  The UK's Health Security Agency says this is a national emergency.
[3:24:25.280 --> 3:24:27.080]  Oh no, it's a bit hot, better panic.
[3:24:27.080 --> 3:24:31.320]  Yes, in the UK schools have closed, trains have stopped running, when it was 17 degrees
[3:24:31.320 --> 3:24:35.280]  in the early morning before the heat wave even began, lazy bastards have demanded days
[3:24:35.280 --> 3:24:40.040]  off work, and a national emergency has been declared, because it's a bit warm in the middle
[3:24:40.040 --> 3:24:44.080]  of July, to a population that has been made addicted to hysteria.
[3:24:44.080 --> 3:24:45.880]  This is thermageddon.
[3:24:45.880 --> 3:24:52.400]  The hot weather has now been deemed as dangerous as this, for the first time, a heat wave is
[3:24:52.400 --> 3:24:53.960]  just as extreme.
[3:24:53.960 --> 3:24:59.000]  Anyhow, hot weather in the UK, a land of drizzle, grey skies and winters that seem to go on
[3:24:59.000 --> 3:25:05.600]  forever, used to be embraced, celebrated, joyfully reported by weathermen, yet now it's gravely
[3:25:05.600 --> 3:25:10.240]  reported like it's thermonuclear fallout, and yes, hot weather kills people, and when
[3:25:10.240 --> 3:25:11.320]  it does, it's tragic.
[3:25:11.320 --> 3:25:14.120]  You know what kills way more people?
[3:25:14.120 --> 3:25:15.120]  Cold weather.
[3:25:15.120 --> 3:25:17.120]  Apparently that's not part of the climate crisis.
[3:25:17.120 --> 3:25:21.880]  And in fact, I'm going to get into the climate crisis hysteria later in the show, but I was
[3:25:21.880 --> 3:25:27.280]  talking about these excess deaths, again, non-COVID excess deaths in the United Kingdom.
[3:25:27.280 --> 3:25:33.520]  They track almost exactly spring boosters in over 75s in England.
[3:25:33.520 --> 3:25:39.080]  They started getting the spring booster vaccines at the end of March.
[3:25:39.080 --> 3:25:40.920]  That went up a bit towards mid-April.
[3:25:40.920 --> 3:25:45.400]  That was the high point for the over 75s in England getting the spring boosters.
[3:25:45.400 --> 3:25:50.280]  Then that declined to where now, at the start of July, according to this graph, it's basically
[3:25:50.280 --> 3:25:52.240]  done that campaign.
[3:25:52.240 --> 3:25:58.040]  But you'll notice that there's a strange correlation between non-COVID excess death
[3:25:58.040 --> 3:26:02.320]  occurrences and spring boosters in the over 75s in England.
[3:26:02.320 --> 3:26:08.640]  Now, I'm not suggesting anything, but it's a very close match between the timescale of
[3:26:08.640 --> 3:26:14.120]  those over 75s getting the spring boosters and this mysterious occurrence of non-COVID
[3:26:14.120 --> 3:26:20.000]  excess deaths, which remain completely unexplained by the media, the same media that hyperventilates.
[3:26:20.000 --> 3:26:26.960]  Over summer hot weather, which kills basically no one, a couple of people tragically drowned,
[3:26:26.960 --> 3:26:33.520]  which happens every summer, that's apparently a massive problem, but 9,500 excess non-COVID
[3:26:33.520 --> 3:26:38.920]  deaths, which are unexplained in the last 11 weeks in this country, nobody's talking
[3:26:38.920 --> 3:26:39.920]  about that.
[3:26:39.920 --> 3:26:47.360]  Meanwhile, Novak Djokovic, Novaks Djokovic, Wimbledon champion seven times over, has confirmed
[3:26:47.360 --> 3:26:52.440]  that he's not going to get vaccinated, and as such, he is not going to be able to compete
[3:26:52.440 --> 3:26:57.360]  at the US Open Tennis Tournament in Flushing Meadow next month.
[3:26:57.360 --> 3:27:02.440]  Now, of course, this is because the organizers have said they have to follow the law of the
[3:27:02.440 --> 3:27:08.360]  United States or rather the discriminatory practice of the Biden administration, which
[3:27:08.360 --> 3:27:13.440]  still to this day, despite the fact that other Western countries, most other major Western
[3:27:13.440 --> 3:27:19.640]  countries have abandoned this policy, still bar unvaccinated people from entering the
[3:27:19.640 --> 3:27:20.720]  United States.
[3:27:20.720 --> 3:27:25.480]  I haven't been able to enter the United States for years now, God knows when I will, maybe
[3:27:25.480 --> 3:27:30.200]  after 2024, when someone else is elected.
[3:27:30.200 --> 3:27:34.360]  But the Serbian who's won the US Open three times before won't risk traveling to the country
[3:27:34.360 --> 3:27:39.320]  and experiencing a repeat of his atrocious treatment by authorities in Australia, which
[3:27:39.320 --> 3:27:41.960]  of course ended up in him being deported.
[3:27:41.960 --> 3:27:44.120]  That was an they made an example out of him.
[3:27:44.120 --> 3:27:50.760]  They always plan to deport him again, to make him look like he was at fault.
[3:27:50.760 --> 3:27:55.040]  He said, quote, people still think I forced my way to Australia and tried to come in with
[3:27:55.040 --> 3:27:57.280]  no papers permission or exemption.
[3:27:57.280 --> 3:27:58.280]  It's not true.
[3:27:58.280 --> 3:28:04.200]  As a point out in the article, maybe Djokovic should just join a migrant caravan and sneak
[3:28:04.200 --> 3:28:05.200]  across the border.
[3:28:05.200 --> 3:28:08.280]  Then they'll be given red carpet treatment.
[3:28:08.280 --> 3:28:12.920]  There are no vaccine checks on migrants coming across the southern border into the United
[3:28:12.920 --> 3:28:13.920]  States.
[3:28:13.920 --> 3:28:20.840]  They can enter America at will, but one of the world's best tennis players ever, basically
[3:28:20.840 --> 3:28:26.000]  a living sports legend, Novak Djokovic, can't enter the United States to compete at flushing
[3:28:26.000 --> 3:28:30.000]  meadows because he chose not to take a jab.
[3:28:30.000 --> 3:28:34.280]  Despite the fact that there are other players, numerous other players competing at the same
[3:28:34.280 --> 3:28:39.760]  tournament who are unvaccinated makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
[3:28:39.760 --> 3:28:44.080]  I'm going to come back on the other side, though, and talk about this climate crisis
[3:28:44.080 --> 3:28:49.320]  hysteria that has gripped the United Kingdom over the past few days and the so-called hottest
[3:28:49.320 --> 3:29:19.160]  temperature ever in the UK.
[3:29:19.160 --> 3:29:48.960]  I'm going to come back on the other side, but I'm going to come back on the other side
[3:29:48.960 --> 3:29:55.920]  of the world.
[3:29:55.920 --> 3:30:00.960]  We brought the game-changing product, previously only available to major oil companies around
[3:30:00.960 --> 3:30:06.760]  the world to the civilian market two years ago, the Biopros, for septic tanks, for porta-potties,
[3:30:06.760 --> 3:30:09.280]  for RVs, for your drains, your boats.
[3:30:09.280 --> 3:30:10.280]  It goes on and on.
[3:30:10.280 --> 3:30:15.320]  It'll eat the oil off of your driveway if you just add water, but it's been so successful
[3:30:15.320 --> 3:30:21.840]  now we're selling it to major RV parks, pig farms, you name it, because this stuff will
[3:30:21.840 --> 3:30:31.360]  eat anything that is organic, and it's exclusively available at TheBiopros.com and now InfoWarStore.com.
[3:30:31.360 --> 3:30:36.680]  We sold out of this for almost a year, but we made a major purchase and it is now in
[3:30:36.680 --> 3:30:39.720]  stock for whatever your need is at InfoWarStore.com.
[3:30:39.720 --> 3:30:46.960]  You'll also find instructional videos and more information at InfoWarStore.com or TheBiopros.com.
[3:30:46.960 --> 3:30:55.520]  Made America, powered by God's great creation, it is amazing and it funds the InfoWar.
[3:30:55.520 --> 3:31:02.520]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here, and that's
[3:31:02.520 --> 3:31:07.080]  what people recognize and resonate with, and as Ward said, you're not going to find a
[3:31:07.080 --> 3:31:09.320]  better place for information.
[3:31:09.320 --> 3:31:12.680]  You might not agree with everything, you might not agree with all our perspectives, but we
[3:31:12.680 --> 3:31:17.320]  cover all the information, and there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here.
[3:31:17.320 --> 3:31:18.320]  Thank you for that, Ward.
[3:31:18.320 --> 3:31:22.960]  InfoWarStore.com, by the way, the products he mentions, InfoWarStore.com is where to
[3:31:22.960 --> 3:31:25.920]  get them, folks, and we do have the best supplements.
[3:31:25.920 --> 3:31:32.360]  Just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information, we do the best with our
[3:31:32.360 --> 3:31:34.640]  supplements as well.
[3:31:34.640 --> 3:31:38.240]  Look at the hair and beard support formula, folks, this is a joke.
[3:31:38.240 --> 3:31:40.880]  We're giving this thing away, it's 75% off.
[3:31:40.880 --> 3:31:43.440]  By the way, it works for me, in case you haven't noticed.
[3:31:43.440 --> 3:31:47.440]  The hair and beard formula is working for me.
[3:31:47.440 --> 3:31:49.560]  Quite well, I might add.
[3:31:49.560 --> 3:31:54.320]  Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men, I go and see them quite
[3:31:54.320 --> 3:31:56.920]  often now.
[3:31:56.920 --> 3:32:02.080]  The globalists are doing everything they can to destroy heterosexual relationships, to
[3:32:02.080 --> 3:32:04.600]  annihilate the family, to split up marriages.
[3:32:04.600 --> 3:32:09.960]  And if you look at the studies, the number one cause of marriages breaking up is the
[3:32:09.960 --> 3:32:14.400]  fact that the men cannot satisfy their women in the bedroom.
[3:32:14.400 --> 3:32:18.400]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen, and even if you're like me and hardly ever have
[3:32:18.400 --> 3:32:21.880]  a problem, I mean, all of us, one for another, two, that's just the truth.
[3:32:21.880 --> 3:32:24.320]  The liberals will make fun of that, but everybody knows that's true.

[3:33:45.400 --> 3:33:50.240]  in the United Kingdom this week, which they'd lined up days in advance.
[3:33:50.240 --> 3:33:56.200]  Where we had, yes, whisper it, a spell of hot weather in the middle of July in summer.
[3:33:56.200 --> 3:34:00.680]  Now, of course, these are the same people who, when you point out that Arctic sea ice
[3:34:00.680 --> 3:34:06.840]  is basically at its 30-year normal average, that we've had the coldest temperatures measured
[3:34:06.840 --> 3:34:11.480]  any time in history in certain parts of the globe, all that's nothing because climate
[3:34:11.480 --> 3:34:16.600]  is not indicative or temperatures, weather is not indicative of climate change, apart
[3:34:16.600 --> 3:34:20.440]  from when it's hot, apart from when it's the middle of July, and then it is indicative
[3:34:20.440 --> 3:34:26.080]  of climate change, that process happened once again this week and it was all set up.
[3:34:26.080 --> 3:34:32.240]  The narrative was carefully placed well in advance as you'll see because I kind of predicted
[3:34:32.240 --> 3:34:37.880]  what they would do in the first video that I made on the Monday and then the second video
[3:34:37.880 --> 3:34:43.120]  on the Tuesday where they actually did exactly what I predicted they would do.
[3:34:43.120 --> 3:34:46.840]  The first video which we're going to go to is called Thermageddon, and then we'll go
[3:34:46.840 --> 3:34:47.960]  to the other one after.
[3:34:47.960 --> 3:34:54.400]  This is Thermageddon, this is the video I released on Monday before the record temperature
[3:34:54.400 --> 3:34:59.040]  was announced, basically predicting how they would get that record temperature.
[3:34:59.040 --> 3:35:01.600]  So here is Thermageddon.
[3:35:01.600 --> 3:35:05.680]  Until they try to bring back all the corona restrictions, a new reason for everyone to
[3:35:05.680 --> 3:35:10.160]  be cowering inside their homes, terrified, has now been discovered.
[3:35:10.160 --> 3:35:12.400]  It's called summer.
[3:35:12.400 --> 3:35:16.600]  The UK's health security agency says this is a national emergency.
[3:35:16.600 --> 3:35:18.520]  Oh no, it's a bit hot, better panic.
[3:35:18.520 --> 3:35:22.720]  Yes, in the UK schools have closed, trains have stopped running, when it was 17 degrees
[3:35:22.720 --> 3:35:26.680]  in the early morning before the heat wave even began, lazy bastards have demanded days
[3:35:26.680 --> 3:35:31.440]  off work and a national emergency has been declared because it's a bit warm in the middle
[3:35:31.440 --> 3:35:35.480]  of July to a population that has been made addicted to hysteria.
[3:35:35.480 --> 3:35:37.240]  This is Thermageddon.
[3:35:37.240 --> 3:35:43.760]  The hot weather has now been deemed as dangerous as this, for the first time a heat wave is
[3:35:43.760 --> 3:35:45.400]  just as extreme.
[3:35:45.400 --> 3:35:50.000]  Funny how hot weather in the UK, a land of drizzle, grey skies and winters that seem
[3:35:50.000 --> 3:35:55.800]  to go on forever, used to be embraced, celebrated, joyfully reported by weathermen.
[3:35:55.800 --> 3:36:01.440]  Yet now it's gravely reported like it's thermonuclear fallout, and yes, hot weather kills people
[3:36:01.440 --> 3:36:02.760]  and when it does it's tragic.
[3:36:02.760 --> 3:36:05.560]  You know what kills way more people?
[3:36:05.560 --> 3:36:06.560]  Cold weather.
[3:36:06.560 --> 3:36:09.080]  So that's not part of the climate crisis though.
[3:36:09.080 --> 3:36:12.840]  You see, weather is an indicative of climate change, apart from when it's hot weather and
[3:36:12.840 --> 3:36:15.120]  they say it is, and then it is.
[3:36:15.120 --> 3:36:16.120]  Don't question it.
[3:36:16.120 --> 3:36:20.280]  Interesting though how people conducting their own temperature recordings are finding that
[3:36:20.280 --> 3:36:25.240]  in many cases across the country there are several degrees below those officially being
[3:36:25.240 --> 3:36:27.800]  reported by the Met Office and the BBC.
[3:36:27.800 --> 3:36:28.800]  How could that be?
[3:36:28.800 --> 3:36:33.480]  Surely they wouldn't manipulate temperature readings by taking them next to airport runways
[3:36:33.480 --> 3:36:35.800]  with hot jet engines and tarmac.
[3:36:35.800 --> 3:36:37.000]  What they owe.
[3:36:37.000 --> 3:36:41.280]  About one half of all land surface temperature measurements used to show global warming and
[3:36:41.280 --> 3:36:46.600]  promote the command and control net zero agenda, are taken near or adjacent to hot airport
[3:36:46.600 --> 3:36:47.600]  runways.
[3:36:47.600 --> 3:36:52.760]  And the raw data actually shows that the UK was cooler in the 2010s than the 2000s.
[3:36:52.760 --> 3:36:57.400]  The 9.17 Celsius average temperature in the 2010 decade in England was colder than the
[3:36:57.400 --> 3:37:00.200]  previous 10 years at 9.31 Celsius.
[3:37:00.200 --> 3:37:04.640]  But that doesn't make for dire apocalyptic click baity headlines though, does it?
[3:37:04.640 --> 3:37:09.480]  Well why shouldn't we trust the same people who published articles in 2004 saying that
[3:37:09.480 --> 3:37:14.920]  by 2020 manmade climate change would cause millions of deaths with major European cities
[3:37:14.920 --> 3:37:15.920]  being sunken.
[3:37:15.920 --> 3:37:17.400]  Yeah, they actually said that.
[3:37:17.400 --> 3:37:21.960]  Leading to nuclear war and global environmental riots, why should we doubt the same people
[3:37:21.960 --> 3:37:27.240]  who said that glaciers will all be gone by 2020 and that the Arctic would have ice free
[3:37:27.240 --> 3:37:29.120]  summers by 2013?
[3:37:29.120 --> 3:37:34.480]  Meanwhile, in the real world, Arctic sea ice is just 3% below its 30 year average.
[3:37:34.480 --> 3:37:38.800]  Why should we even consider being skeptical towards the same people who told us back in
[3:37:38.800 --> 3:37:41.560]  the 70s that a new ice age was coming?
[3:37:41.560 --> 3:37:45.360]  Why should we not believe them when they've been so straightforward and honest with us
[3:37:45.360 --> 3:37:47.360]  on every previous occasion?
[3:37:47.360 --> 3:37:52.920]  Last year, one of the authors of the United Nations IPCC report lauded the fact that quote
[3:37:52.920 --> 3:37:58.720]  people are starting to get scared about climate change and that this would quote affect the
[3:37:58.720 --> 3:37:59.720]  way they vote.
[3:37:59.720 --> 3:38:06.320]  Yeah, seems like there's an awful lot more to this than just the weather.
[3:38:06.320 --> 3:38:12.040]  Now note in that video how I explain how they achieve high temperatures by measuring them
[3:38:12.040 --> 3:38:18.520]  at airports and then note what happened as we achieved our hottest day ever in the United
[3:38:18.520 --> 3:38:20.760]  Kingdom the very next day.
[3:38:20.760 --> 3:38:22.320]  Let's go to the second video.
[3:38:22.320 --> 3:38:23.320]  Here it is.
[3:38:23.320 --> 3:38:25.080]  I guess we've all been sat down.
[3:38:25.080 --> 3:38:28.800]  I guess the climate change alarmists were actually correct.
[3:38:28.800 --> 3:38:34.520]  The UK has recorded its hottest temperature ever with the thermometer hitting 39.1 degrees
[3:38:34.520 --> 3:38:36.520]  Celsius in Charlewood Surrey.
[3:38:36.520 --> 3:38:39.040]  Gotta hold my hands up and take the L here.
[3:38:39.040 --> 3:38:40.040]  I was wrong.
[3:38:40.040 --> 3:38:41.040]  You were right.
[3:38:41.040 --> 3:38:42.040]  I guess that's it.
[3:38:42.040 --> 3:38:43.040]  Channel's dead.
[3:38:43.040 --> 3:38:44.040]  Lefties were vindicated.
[3:38:44.040 --> 3:38:45.040]  Hold up.
[3:38:45.040 --> 3:38:46.040]  Where's Charlewood?
[3:38:46.040 --> 3:38:53.400]  Oh, it's right next to Gatwick Airport.
[3:38:53.400 --> 3:38:55.640]  It basically is Gatwick Airport.
[3:38:55.640 --> 3:39:01.040]  It's sprawling industrial complex as airport runways, hot tarmac, jet engines, totally
[3:39:01.040 --> 3:39:03.840]  the fairest place to record a temperature reading.
[3:39:03.840 --> 3:39:04.840]  What's next?
[3:39:04.840 --> 3:39:09.360]  UK's hottest temperature beating again, thermometer meeting taken inside Iron Smelting Factory.
[3:39:09.360 --> 3:39:13.640]  They're going to start measuring average historical wind speeds from inside wind tunnels.
[3:39:13.640 --> 3:39:19.440]  But wait, an even hotter temperature was recorded, broken 40 Celsius for the first time ever.
[3:39:19.440 --> 3:39:21.240]  Where was that reading taken?
[3:39:21.240 --> 3:39:32.120]  How strange that the two hottest places this afternoon, Heathrow and Gatwick, and the ones
[3:39:32.120 --> 3:39:37.120]  covered in heat-absorbing black tarmac and home to many heat-generating jet engines.
[3:39:37.120 --> 3:39:41.960]  An amazing coincidence, but this isn't a one-off, it's a regular occurrence.
[3:39:41.960 --> 3:39:46.560]  Research by Professor Ross McKittrick shows, quote, about one-half of all land surface
[3:39:46.560 --> 3:39:50.560]  temperature measurements used to show global warming and promote the command and control
[3:39:50.560 --> 3:39:55.680]  net zero agenda are taken near or adjacent to airport runways.
[3:39:55.680 --> 3:40:00.800]  And yes, both the Met Office and the BBC, which today delivered as the hottest temperatures
[3:40:00.800 --> 3:40:04.840]  ever from airports, both use this same data.
[3:40:04.840 --> 3:40:09.320]  From the professor's research, we learn that data taken from airports has increased by
[3:40:09.320 --> 3:40:12.360]  50% over the last few decades.
[3:40:12.360 --> 3:40:17.360]  This has had the effect of increasing the contribution from airports to around 50%.
[3:40:17.360 --> 3:40:22.480]  McKittrick noted that the cuts reduced the average latitude of source data and removed
[3:40:22.480 --> 3:40:27.440]  relatively more cooler, high-altitude monitoring sites.
[3:40:27.440 --> 3:40:32.440]  Almost every plank that supports net zero is provided by the surface temperature data sets
[3:40:32.440 --> 3:40:34.400]  amplified by climate models.
[3:40:34.400 --> 3:40:39.160]  They are at the center of the grim pronouncements, made by the IPCC and loyally passed on by
[3:40:39.160 --> 3:40:40.840]  mainstream messengers.
[3:40:40.840 --> 3:40:45.480]  Time perhaps to look in detail at temperature data sets boosted by jet-exhausted constant
[3:40:45.480 --> 3:40:49.840]  upward adjustments along with climate forecasting models that are invariably wrong to see if
[3:40:49.840 --> 3:40:54.000]  the science is quite as settled as defined by elite political opinions.
[3:40:54.000 --> 3:40:59.160]  So yeah, of course, temperature data taken in 2022 from boiling hot, heat-amplifying
[3:40:59.160 --> 3:41:05.120]  airports is going to be higher than temperatures taken previously from other sites with environmentally
[3:41:05.120 --> 3:41:06.840]  cooler surroundings.
[3:41:06.840 --> 3:41:09.480]  Not going to hear any of that on the news tonight, though, are you?
[3:41:09.480 --> 3:41:13.880]  Oh no, all you're going to hear is apocalyptic doomsday hysteria about the planet being
[3:41:13.880 --> 3:41:14.880]  on fire.
[3:41:14.880 --> 3:41:18.960]  Now the only solution is for you to cripple your own living standards and cancel your
[3:41:18.960 --> 3:41:24.200]  family holiday while the elite will continue to enjoy their luxury private jet lifestyles
[3:41:24.200 --> 3:41:31.520]  as you cower inside your home afraid of viruses and the weather.
[3:41:31.520 --> 3:41:36.920]  Now attendant to all this propaganda, we had sudden outbreaks of fires across the United
[3:41:36.920 --> 3:41:43.960]  Kingdom with compost heaps with grassland spontaneously combusting for apparently no
[3:41:43.960 --> 3:41:47.760]  reason whatsoever apart from climate change.
[3:41:47.760 --> 3:41:53.040]  Now we had temperatures the day before, one degree Celsius or two degrees Celsius below
[3:41:53.040 --> 3:41:58.920]  what we had on the Tuesday and yet there were no massive fires on the Monday.
[3:41:58.920 --> 3:41:59.920]  Interesting isn't it?
[3:41:59.920 --> 3:42:06.000]  Headline here, huge scum thought blaze was deliberately set, so there's fire service.
[3:42:06.000 --> 3:42:11.160]  This was one of the examples that they brought that they reported, huge amount of land gone
[3:42:11.160 --> 3:42:16.200]  up in smoke basically, somebody on Twitter points out that it was actually pending planning
[3:42:16.200 --> 3:42:20.920]  application for a new housing development, what a coincidence.
[3:42:20.920 --> 3:42:26.360]  So we have grassland compost bins suddenly spontaneously exploding, the media seizes on
[3:42:26.360 --> 3:42:31.880]  it and says, look, global warming, England is on fire, really.
[3:42:31.880 --> 3:42:38.040]  Do you think the same extinction rebellion activists who glue themselves to roads wouldn't
[3:42:38.040 --> 3:42:44.240]  set fires, wouldn't engage in arson and some of these blazes have already proven to be
[3:42:44.240 --> 3:42:52.120]  arson in the 24 hours since they happened, absolutely massive scandal brewing once again.
[3:42:52.120 --> 3:43:18.120]  Hit dot news, we'll be back in going.
[3:43:18.120 --> 3:43:48.040]  We'll be back in about 30 minutes, we'll be back in about 30 minutes, we'll be back
[3:43:48.040 --> 3:44:17.840]  in about 30 minutes, we'll be back in about 30 minutes, we'll be back in about 30 minutes,
[3:44:17.840 --> 3:44:47.760]  we'll be back in about 30 minutes, we'll be back in about 30 minutes, we'll be back
[3:44:47.760 --> 3:45:17.680]  in about 30 minutes, we'll be back in about 30 minutes, we'll be back in about 30 minutes,
[3:45:17.680 --> 3:45:47.600]  we'll be back in about 30 minutes, we'll be back in about 30 minutes, we'll be back in
[3:45:47.600 --> 3:46:17.520]  about 30 minutes, we'll be back in about 30 minutes, we'll be back in about 30 minutes,
[3:46:17.520 --> 3:46:47.440]  we'll be back in about 30 minutes, we'll be back in about 30 minutes, we'll be back in
[3:46:47.440 --> 3:47:17.360]  about 30 minutes, we'll be back in about 30 minutes, we'll be back in about 30 minutes,
[3:47:17.360 --> 3:47:47.280]  we'll be back in about 30 minutes, we'll be back in about 30 minutes, we'll be back in
[3:47:47.280 --> 3:48:17.200]  about 30 minutes, we'll be back in about 30 minutes, we'll be back in about 30 minutes,
[3:48:17.200 --> 3:48:47.120]  we'll be back in about 30 minutes, we'll be back in about 30 minutes, we'll be back in
[3:48:47.120 --> 3:49:17.040]  about 30 minutes, we'll be back in about 30 minutes,
[3:49:17.040 --> 3:49:46.960]  we'll be back in about 30 minutes, we'll be back in about 30 minutes,
[3:49:46.960 --> 3:50:16.880]  we'll be back in about 30 minutes, we'll be back in about 30 minutes,
[3:50:16.880 --> 3:50:36.800]  we'll be back in about 30 minutes,
[3:50:36.800 --> 3:50:48.920]  it was all my fault for taking an annual holiday, oh wait a minute, spraying aerosols into
[3:50:48.920 --> 3:51:03.640]  the upper atmosphere, sounds like you're getting dangerously close to the C word there, right
[3:51:03.640 --> 3:51:09.360]  so earth based geoengineering methods are too risky that you want to create a giant bubble
[3:51:09.360 --> 3:51:14.800]  in space that blocks out the sun, yeah I'm sure that'll have zero knock on effects, listen
[3:51:14.800 --> 3:51:19.640]  we're not frigging vampires, we need the sun, how about let's not accidentally trigger a
[3:51:19.640 --> 3:51:26.160]  new ice age to satiate the demented discredited agenda of net zero green activists, how about
[3:51:26.160 --> 3:51:31.760]  let's not follow the scientific advice of an organization whose leader wants to put microchips
[3:51:31.760 --> 3:51:36.820]  in your brain to read your thoughts, leading to a dystopian transhumanist fourth industrial
[3:51:36.820 --> 3:51:42.720]  revolution future of augmented elites and obsolete useless eaters, a lot of anger, yeah
[3:51:42.720 --> 3:51:51.400]  perhaps putting Dr. Strangelove in control of our planet's future isn't the best idea,
[3:51:51.400 --> 3:51:57.240]  so while the WEF and the wannabe Bonville and Claus Schwab want to block out the sun, tell
[3:51:57.240 --> 3:52:03.080]  you that you'll own nothing and be happy, Bill Gates continues to buy up vast swathes
[3:52:03.080 --> 3:52:09.440]  of US farmland, of course while farmers across Europe, across the west are being forced to
[3:52:09.440 --> 3:52:16.080]  sell their farmland to the government being hit with draconian restrictions in terms of
[3:52:16.080 --> 3:52:21.880]  emissions, nitrogen emissions, green agenda emissions that will put them out of business
[3:52:21.880 --> 3:52:29.000]  forever, and yet Bill Gates, he's taken care of himself by buying vast amounts of farmland
[3:52:29.000 --> 3:52:36.200]  on a regular basis, keeps doing it, did it again recently in South Dakota, well now congressman
[3:52:36.200 --> 3:52:42.120]  demands Bill Gates explain why he's buying up vast amounts of farmland, this is South
[3:52:42.120 --> 3:52:47.840]  Dakota congressman Dusty Johnson and he's demanding answers, he wrote in a letter it's
[3:52:47.840 --> 3:52:53.960]  become clear in recent reports that Mr. Gates is the largest private farmland owner in America,
[3:52:53.960 --> 3:53:02.120]  he owns nearly 270,000 acres of farmland across 19 states and basically Johnson is asking
[3:53:02.120 --> 3:53:07.520]  if Bill Gates is pushing this net zero agenda, he's constantly insisting that Americans
[3:53:07.520 --> 3:53:14.080]  should stop eating red meat and start eating the bugs, why is he buying up vast amounts
[3:53:14.080 --> 3:53:19.240]  of farmland, why is it bad for Americans to own property, but it's good for him to have
[3:53:19.240 --> 3:53:24.240]  a monopoly on US farmland across the country.
[3:53:24.240 --> 3:53:28.960]  Let's go to this other video now though because we're running out of time, Starbucks has come
[3:53:28.960 --> 3:53:33.240]  out and announced that they're having to close all these stores because basically drug addicts
[3:53:33.240 --> 3:53:38.560]  and criminals are going in there and conducting their business, very funny in a thick way
[3:53:38.560 --> 3:53:44.200]  if you know the history about this, this is Starbucks and the decline of America, let's
[3:53:44.200 --> 3:53:45.400]  roll the clip.
[3:53:45.400 --> 3:53:50.360]  Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is being forced to close branches of the coffee giant across
[3:53:50.360 --> 3:53:51.360]  the country.
[3:53:51.360 --> 3:53:52.360]  Why?
[3:53:52.360 --> 3:53:57.240]  Well because in his own words in elite video quote, America has become unsafe.
[3:53:57.240 --> 3:54:02.400]  And I don't have to spend too much time on what's going on in the country and how America
[3:54:02.400 --> 3:54:08.640]  has become unsafe, but you all read the press release the last couple days about the fact
[3:54:08.640 --> 3:54:13.640]  that we are beginning to close stores that are not on profit and Starbucks is a window
[3:54:13.640 --> 3:54:15.200]  into America.
[3:54:15.200 --> 3:54:18.880]  Starbucks announced they were closing 16 stores with more to probably come, Schultz
[3:54:18.880 --> 3:54:23.720]  blamed the closures on incidents related to drug use and other disruptions, he also said
[3:54:23.720 --> 3:54:28.240]  in the leaked video that the responsibility for all this lies with woke political leaders
[3:54:28.240 --> 3:54:33.360]  who valued advancing insane progressive mantras over the prevention of crime.
[3:54:33.360 --> 3:54:44.520]  And I must say, in my view, at the local, state and federal level, these governments
[3:54:44.520 --> 3:54:50.800]  across the country and leaders, mayors and governors and city councils have advocated
[3:54:50.800 --> 3:54:56.000]  their responsibility in fighting crime and addressing mental illness.
[3:54:56.000 --> 3:54:57.000]  Hold up, wait a minute.
[3:54:57.000 --> 3:55:02.720]  I made a video in March 2015, seven years ago, talking about the genesis of all this.
[3:55:02.720 --> 3:55:07.520]  In case you forgot at the time, Starbucks immediately cowed to the nascent Black Lives
[3:55:07.520 --> 3:55:11.400]  Matter movement to institute an absolutely absurd policy.
[3:55:11.400 --> 3:55:17.080]  That policy involves training their barista staff to start conversations with white customers
[3:55:17.080 --> 3:55:18.840]  about how racist they are.
[3:55:18.840 --> 3:55:20.640]  Yes, this actually happened.
[3:55:20.640 --> 3:55:24.520]  They actually told their staff to confront their own customers and put them on some kind
[3:55:24.520 --> 3:55:27.000]  of weird awkward white guilt trip.
[3:55:27.000 --> 3:55:30.280]  Then what happened three years later in 2018?
[3:55:30.280 --> 3:55:34.560]  Starbucks announced they were basically turning themselves into America's biggest public toilet,
[3:55:34.560 --> 3:55:39.560]  all because two black men in Philly were arrested after trying to use the Starbucks bathroom
[3:55:39.560 --> 3:55:42.640]  without paying for anything and then refusing to leave.
[3:55:42.640 --> 3:55:47.400]  After which time, each and every drag of society was given a free pass to conduct their business
[3:55:47.400 --> 3:55:51.720]  in Starbucks toilets, but the company didn't stop there.
[3:55:51.720 --> 3:55:56.160]  Starbucks followed up by subjecting their long-suffering staff to bizarre re-education
[3:55:56.160 --> 3:56:00.640]  struggle sessions where they were forced to watch endless video after video of white
[3:56:00.640 --> 3:56:05.600]  cops attacking black people, even though the incident that sparked it all had nothing whatsoever
[3:56:05.600 --> 3:56:11.160]  to do with police brutality, so Starbucks threw in its lot with the BLM mob, swung open
[3:56:11.160 --> 3:56:15.600]  their doors to crack heads and junkies, and now they're being forced to close down Starbucks
[3:56:15.600 --> 3:56:18.200]  because of problems with crack heads and junkies.
[3:56:18.200 --> 3:56:19.960]  Wow, who could have seen that coming?
[3:56:19.960 --> 3:56:21.440]  Get woke, go broke.
[3:56:21.440 --> 3:56:26.320]  If by get woke, you mean allowing your restrooms to become foul-smelling, piss-stained drug
[3:56:26.320 --> 3:56:30.360]  dens, all in the name of racial justice, then yeah.
[3:56:30.360 --> 3:56:35.080]  And Howard Schultz has the nerve to blame other people for the mess that his policies
[3:56:35.080 --> 3:56:36.080]  created.
[3:56:36.080 --> 3:56:39.960]  Yeah, of course politicians are to blame for lax laws on open-air drug use.
[3:56:39.960 --> 3:56:44.240]  They've turned the likes of LA and San Francisco into porridge holes, and they're to blame
[3:56:44.240 --> 3:56:46.600]  for eliminating felonies for theft.
[3:56:46.600 --> 3:56:51.040]  They've turned stores in leftist-run cities into pick-and-mix free-for-alls, but it was
[3:56:51.040 --> 3:56:56.920]  Schultz's decision to make Starbucks a safe haven for all that, and in the process incentivising
[3:56:56.920 --> 3:56:59.680]  the criminal behaviour he now decries.
[3:56:59.680 --> 3:57:05.240]  So instead of whining about it and pointing the finger, how about you take some responsibility
[3:57:05.240 --> 3:57:08.720]  for a change?
[3:57:08.720 --> 3:57:09.720]  That's good to wrap it up.
[3:57:09.720 --> 3:57:14.480]  For the Summit News, our Merriam-Webster changes definition of female at the best of transgender
[3:57:14.480 --> 3:57:15.480]  activists.
