[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  The Communist Chinese agent, installed as the 46th President of the United States,
[00:11.000 --> 00:16.000]  Pito Trader Joe, corrupted in your face.
[00:16.000 --> 00:18.000]  But it gets worse.
[00:18.000 --> 00:29.000]  The former head of the CIA, the Wahhabist, the globalist, has said use the CIA against the American people publicly.
[00:29.000 --> 00:32.000]  That's completely illegal. But it's been going on forever.
[00:32.000 --> 00:38.000]  So it's good to get all these globalists and traders out in the open.
[00:38.000 --> 00:44.000]  That is the leftist intel community that runs the CIA.
[00:44.000 --> 00:53.000]  Thank you for joining us on this January 21st, 2021 global transmission.
[00:53.000 --> 00:56.000]  It's incredible to be here. I intend to open the phones up in the first hour.
[00:56.000 --> 01:07.000]  I want to be good about that because I want to get your take on the inauguration, on where everything's going, on Biden announcing the cutoff of our energy supplies,
[01:07.000 --> 01:17.000]  making little girls have men in bathrooms with them, announcing forced inoculations, basically announcing masks everywhere you go, federal mask mandates,
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.000]  just absolutely out of control. I want you to be able to give us your response to that.
[01:21.000 --> 01:32.000]  Here is Brennan on MSNBC announcing the U.S. intelligence community to be the new secret police to go after all the usual suspects who they shouldn't ever write to go after,
[01:32.000 --> 01:36.000]  because then it means everybody else, the Nazis, the this, the that.
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.000]  Remember they label anybody that's pro-gun, pro-family, pro-Christ, the Nazi.
[01:40.000 --> 01:44.000]  Then he adds even the libertarians, of course, but never the communists.
[01:44.000 --> 01:51.000]  There on the list, this man voted for the Communist Party twice, then joined the Wahhabist when he lived in Saudi Arabia.
[01:51.000 --> 01:53.000]  That's the group that runs Al Qaeda. Here he is.
[01:53.000 --> 02:00.000]  I'm going to call. I was thinking today that this is the most relaxed I've been in the course of many inaugurations I've watched because I'm not responsible for it.
[02:00.000 --> 02:05.000]  But I can tell you that when I was in the government, I was, I had white knuckles because of the nature of the threats.
[02:05.000 --> 02:13.000]  But it's so much more difficult today because of what we have seen, not just over the last two weeks, but that certainly has riveted our attention.
[02:13.000 --> 02:19.000]  But because of this growth in polarization in the United States and domestic violence in white supremacist groups.
[02:19.000 --> 02:36.000]  So I know looking forward that the members of the Biden team who have been nominated or have been appointed are now moving in laser-like fashion to try to uncover as much as they can about what looks very similar to insurgency movements that we've seen overseas.
[02:36.000 --> 02:52.000]  Where they germinate in different parts of the country and they gain strength and it brings together an unholy alliance frequently of religious extremists, authoritarians, fascists, bigots, racists, nativists, even libertarians.
[02:52.000 --> 03:04.000]  And unfortunately, I think there has been this momentum that has been generated as a result of, unfortunately, the demagogic rhetoric of people that's just the part of government, but also those who continue in the halls of Congress.
[03:04.000 --> 03:19.000]  And so I really do think that the law enforcement, homeland security, intelligence, and even the defense officials are doing everything possible to root out what seems to be a very, very serious and insidious threat to our democracy.
[03:19.000 --> 03:31.000]  So the threat to the democracy is Trump couldn't call out National Guard for burning cities, which is totally constitutional, and if he had the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman walk over to the Burnt Church at the White House, that was fascism.
[03:31.000 --> 03:42.000]  But he just called not just for the intelligence community, total globalists at the top, swore to destroy the country for the ones that run the whole thing, and even the Department of Defense against the American people.
[03:42.000 --> 03:51.000]  And that's always been the plan. Under Clinton, when I first started really getting into politics, we saw the plan. The military warned us of the plan. They gave us the intel because they were good people.
[03:51.000 --> 04:00.000]  Some of the military's bad. It's that the people at the top running it are super bad, and we have to turn our backs on this and just realize this is the takeover.
[04:00.000 --> 04:09.000]  They're going to stage false flags as the pretext to roll this out and start arresting people, not just taking your bank accounts away, and you have to understand you can't hide under the table from this.
[04:09.000 --> 04:18.000]  It's going to expand into every facet. They want to loop this country. They want to break it. They want to bankrupt it so they can consolidate total control into the world government.
[04:18.000 --> 04:28.000]  So we're going to break it all down. What do you make of the former head of the CIA and one of the top cuckoo conspirators against America and President Trump, John, Kim Trail, geoengineering,
[04:28.000 --> 04:40.000]  Wahhabist, Communist, Brennan on record. All these are on record. What do you make of this guy declaring war on more than half of America and say the U.S. military will be used on Christians?
[04:40.000 --> 04:53.000]  You've heard it. Godowners, nativists, nationalists, everybody, libertarians, we're going to take your calls coming up on this subject at 877-789-2539, 877-789, Alex, first-time callers,
[04:53.000 --> 05:00.000]  long-time callers, agree, disagree, wide open phones.
[05:23.000 --> 05:32.000]  Our vitamin mineral fusion. Before trying vitamin mineral fusion, I always questioned if vitamin supplements ever actually did anything.
[05:32.000 --> 05:40.000]  I never felt much of an effect from other products. But I felt vitamin mineral fusion the first time I took it, immediately.
[05:40.000 --> 05:47.000]  I love how it dissolves in water. I take it every day with my supper. It tastes great, feels great.
[05:47.000 --> 05:56.000]  And right now, it's 50% off. It sells out fast, so stock up now at 50% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[05:56.000 --> 06:20.000]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion at InfowarsStore.com.
[06:20.000 --> 06:34.000]  November 3, 2020 are over. And now we're into the first official day of Joe Biden being the president, not a bifurcated day where he came in halfway through.
[06:34.000 --> 06:43.000]  And there is a flurry of activities to break our economic back, to keep us shut down, to make us wear muzzles, to sexualize children.
[06:43.000 --> 06:58.000]  Every evil you can imagine. And the former head of the CIA, who is an admitted member of the Communist Party, voted for Communist Party president candidates twice, joined the parent group of Al-Qaeda, the Wahhabist order.
[06:58.000 --> 07:06.000]  John, the Communist Brennan, who also admits there's a chemtrailing operation. He says it's good for our weather, which now Biden is going to bring back.
[07:06.000 --> 07:14.000]  You'll see more chemtrails than ever. He has announced that they're going to use the Pentagon, the military, the CIA, against everyone.
[07:14.000 --> 07:21.000]  Christians, gun owners, and he even said libertarians. You are a threat. You are a terrorist. You will be dealt with.
[07:21.000 --> 07:29.000]  So there's your authoritarianism you were looking for. And he's the guy quarterbacking a lot of their operations.
[07:29.000 --> 07:39.000]  Absolutely, totally evil and disgusting. As Tucker Carlson came out and said last night, Biden has declared war on half the country.
[07:39.000 --> 07:44.000]  And so they're not just going to call you white supremacists now. They're going to call you terrorists.
[07:44.000 --> 07:50.000]  And I think you can guess by now rolling over to this and bowing down to this is not going to make you safe.
[07:50.000 --> 07:57.000]  It's going to put all of us in a worse position. We have cancer. It's called globalist authoritarianism. We must say no to it.
[07:57.000 --> 08:08.000]  There's something very important to understand. The reason they're doing this, and I told you this years ago, but now they have major academic studies showing it.
[08:08.000 --> 08:19.000]  It's not just big tech, but the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Jeff Bezos's of the world, but especially the generational wealth.
[08:19.000 --> 08:30.000]  The Bezos is a generational wealth. They live on giant 10,000, 50,000, 100,000 acre estates. They'll have up to 100 mansions.
[08:30.000 --> 08:38.000]  They'll have up to 10, 15 yachts, 20, 30 aircraft. They don't interact with the public.
[08:38.000 --> 09:00.000]  And when you saw on January 19th, a few days ago, all of downtown D.C. and the mall, that big giant Egyptian style monolith, shut down and only Biden and his wife and Kamala Harris and her whatever he is walking around together.
[09:00.000 --> 09:10.000]  And that image of it being totally clear, that's what they want. And that's what globalism is. It's bringing world government, carry out the orderly depopulation of the planet.
[09:10.000 --> 09:17.000]  Whatever's left is in big compact city ghettos, and the globalists have freedom to roam the earth on their own.
[09:17.000 --> 09:30.000]  Now, how do I know that? I read the writings of them. I made a film called End Game, E-N-D-G-A-M-E End Game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[09:30.000 --> 09:37.000]  Long before they had the marble comic movie End Game, which is also about extermination.
[09:37.000 --> 09:47.000]  And in there, you will see them explain that they're going to all have lives into technology and live forever. You are not.
[09:47.000 --> 09:56.000]  So when you see the process of staying in your house, wearing a mask, taking five inoculations a year, having travel passes, scanning a QR code to go in and out of your house.
[09:56.000 --> 10:03.000]  That's all being rolled out in the U.K., China, Germany, the U.S. now in some areas at university level.
[10:03.000 --> 10:08.000]  You think, oh, well, this is just a dystopian system to control us. No.
[10:08.000 --> 10:18.000]  It is a dystopian system to phase you out because they see you as mold or mildew growing on their food in the refrigerator.
[10:18.000 --> 10:25.000]  They see you as weevils that got into the grain in the pantry. They see you as a mindless, stupid infestation.
[10:25.000 --> 10:32.000]  Because in their social, Darwinistic worldview, if you can't see through what they're doing when it's out in the open,
[10:32.000 --> 10:35.000]  then you deserve what happens to you.
[10:35.000 --> 10:39.000]  So I can talk about all this other news forever.
[10:39.000 --> 10:53.000]  But we have a predatory, globalist class telling you that they give $10.6 billion from all the big Fortune 100, but mainly big tech.
[10:53.000 --> 11:01.000]  $10.6 billion last year to Black Lives Matter to then fund all the insurrections you see, the false flags you name it.
[11:01.000 --> 11:08.000]  But also fund Antifa. They got $1.3 billion last year. $1.3 billion.
[11:08.000 --> 11:16.000]  That's the establishment. And that's them attacking what's left of civilization, the middle class and independent economic systems
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.000]  that can still have the public be able to hold out and be self-sufficient.
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.000]  That's why they want homeless everywhere. That's why they advertise, be a drug addict, be homeless.
[11:25.000 --> 11:33.000]  They want to get you used to tent cities so that as they collapse the borders, and there's giant tent cities even bigger with third world people there,
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.000]  and as society breaks down, you will incrementally accept it like the frog in the hot water.
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  It's slowly turned up.
[11:40.000 --> 11:46.000]  So Steve Watson at infowars.com is on a very important article that deals with the basics of this.
[11:46.000 --> 11:54.000]  Academic study finds big tech elites are in their own class different to the rest of humanity.
[11:54.000 --> 12:05.000]  We'll cover that more later with this chilling new compilation that's come out of, quote, world leaders calling for the great reset
[12:05.000 --> 12:10.000]  and the build back better after they collapse you. They go, don't worry, it's going to be a lot better.
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  Just accept it. And on the other side, it'll get better.
[12:13.000 --> 12:18.000]  But it's like driving in a car that never gets to a destination. You keep asking, are we almost there? Yeah, you're almost there.
[12:18.000 --> 12:23.000]  Just be patient. You never get there. It's the process that only locks you down worse.
[12:23.000 --> 12:32.000]  And I saw a clip, a grainy clip of a Canadian early last year,
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.000]  warning of how this was incremental and how it was a bear trap.
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.000]  Now, once you put your arm in it, your leg in it, you never get out.
[12:38.000 --> 12:41.000]  We're going to play that clip coming up at the bottom of the hour as well.
[12:41.000 --> 12:52.000]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, first-time callers, new callers, regular callers.
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.000]  You disagree. You agree. I just ask you to have a clear phone and just don't thank me. I thank you too.
[12:56.000 --> 12:59.000]  Let's just get right to your point. We'll go on to the next person.
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.000]  We've already got Chris, Daryl, Scott, Greg, and many others.
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  Because I want to get the calls in here.
[13:04.000 --> 13:10.000]  What you have to say about the world, about Brennan and others declaring war, saying the Pentagon will be used on American citizens now, gun owners.
[13:10.000 --> 13:15.000]  Christians, veterans groups, and, quote, even libertarians.
[13:15.000 --> 13:19.000]  Not allowed to be do that now. You're a collectivist now under a communist.
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.000]  Boy, that's fighting fascism, having the CIA and Pentagon shut down the sin.
[13:24.000 --> 13:29.000]  Gavin McGinnis is going to be joining us. Steve Quill will join us again. And Jay Dyer.
[13:29.000 --> 13:34.000]  I knew about the Great Reset when they first heard about it five years ago, but Jay really reminded me of it last year.
[13:34.000 --> 13:41.000]  This was the Great Reset very early on, so we appreciate Jay. He'll be hosting in the fourth hour.
[13:41.000 --> 13:47.000]  Separately, we are kept on air by your purchases. I want to salute from the bottom of my heart and thank you all for keeping us in the fight.
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  Plus, we have great products that make your life a lot better.
[13:49.000 --> 13:58.000]  Vitamineral fusion is a high quality vitamin, mineral, essential, nutrient, amino acid, multivitamin.
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.000]  But it's liquid, so you absorb a lot more, and it's not synthetic, crappy vitamins.
[14:04.000 --> 14:11.000]  It's high-end vitamins, high-end minerals, high-end amino acids that are known to help absorb this into the body.
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.000]  I have a plastic pitcher, also a glass pitcher, a couple times a week.
[14:14.000 --> 14:18.000]  I've got a few scoops, fill it up with some ice in it, pour myself a glass with the rest of the refrigerator.
[14:18.000 --> 14:25.000]  And I have that instead of the more fattening juices and things that I like that aren't even really good for me.
[14:25.000 --> 14:28.000]  I mean, orange juice tastes great, it has a little bit of vitamin C, but it's not really that good for you.
[14:28.000 --> 14:37.000]  This is absolutely so good for children, so good for women, so good for men, so good for old people who have malabsorption issues.
[14:37.000 --> 14:42.000]  You may be taking the regular daily allowance of stuff in your food, but you're not absorbing it through the guts.
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.000]  That's why older people need bigger dosages, but no one will tell you that, even though it's in the medical literature.
[14:47.000 --> 14:52.000]  So for old folks, especially vitamin, mineral, fusion, I drink it twice a day.
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.000]  When I'm smart, sometimes I forget. In fact, I want something right now, I'm going to go make something during the break.
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, vitamin, mineral, fusion back in stock.
[15:00.000 --> 15:09.000]  It's being sold out for months and months, and despite the fact that we're not going to get more by the time it sells out,
[15:09.000 --> 15:16.000]  I'm still selling it at 50% off because I want those of you that have been on the fence to experience how great it is and get it for yourself.
[15:16.000 --> 15:22.000]  It's essential to your immune system, essential to all biological action in the body.
[15:22.000 --> 15:33.000]  Vitamin, mineral, fusion, 50% off, 96% reviews, 4.8 stars on third-party sites, infowarstore.com, or AAA-2533139.
[15:33.000 --> 15:41.000]  And the big sale, the big global storm sale, all those other great items like X2 and so many others at 50% off,
[15:41.000 --> 15:50.000]  that has to end on Sunday to take advantage of the big mega sale, but the new sale is vitamin, mineral, fusion until it sells out at 50% off.
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.000]  Boost your immune system before it's too late.
[15:53.000 --> 16:12.000]  We'll be right back with your phone calls for now.
[16:23.000 --> 16:31.000]  You can watch a new URL before they ban it, but Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail.
[16:31.000 --> 16:38.000]  But the new website is TheResistance.video.
[16:38.000 --> 16:42.000]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[16:42.000 --> 16:52.000]  So the new URL that links right to banned.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is at TheResistance.video.
[16:52.000 --> 16:58.000]  Share the link. TheResistance.video. TheResistance.video.
[16:58.000 --> 17:05.000]  Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain, many of the best-selling products in Full Awards are no longer available.
[17:05.000 --> 17:13.000]  And I thought that Commonwealth might be gone forever, but after eight months, we got about 25% of the order we put in delivered to us.
[17:13.000 --> 17:15.000]  The rest, they hope, in a few months comes in.
[17:15.000 --> 17:26.000]  It's a proprietary system using specially fed quail and their eggs. It's very powerful when it comes to blocking seasonal irritants and a lot more.
[17:26.000 --> 17:31.000]  So get your pollen block back in stock at infowarstore.com today.
[17:31.000 --> 17:35.000]  And, by the way, activated charcoal toothpaste sold out for months is now back in stock as well.
[17:35.000 --> 17:42.000]  They're great products and influencing info war, so get your pollen block and get your activated charcoal toothpaste at infowarstore.com today.
[17:42.000 --> 17:48.000]  Again, our activated charcoal toothpaste doesn't have additives. It's concentrated. People love it.
[17:48.000 --> 17:52.000]  It's amazing. There's no toothpaste out there like it. And pollen block is proprietary as well.
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  They're back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[17:54.000 --> 18:12.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[18:12.000 --> 18:19.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[18:19.000 --> 18:24.000]  So here's how the globalist communist takeover works. They steal the election. They put their people in.
[18:24.000 --> 18:32.000]  Soros gets almost all the major state attorney generals and district attorneys at the county and city level in force.
[18:32.000 --> 18:40.000]  The university is going to pure brainwashing mode, anti-free speech mode, the media attacks anybody that's for freedom, big tech silences everybody.
[18:40.000 --> 18:49.000]  Major corporations start taking bank accounts and business away and insurance accounts from mainline conservatives, mainline TV hosts, mainline baseball players.
[18:49.000 --> 18:56.000]  It's here. Absolute total oppression. Oh, it's okay for Alex Jones. Now it's you.
[18:56.000 --> 19:04.000]  And so a lot of people say, well, I better shut up. No, you do that. They completely win because this is a hot takeover they plan.
[19:04.000 --> 19:11.000]  So John Brennan, former head of the CIA, super corrupt, voted for the Communist Party twice. He's proud of it.
[19:11.000 --> 19:17.000]  Joined the Wahhabist order in Saudi Arabia when he lived there for 10 years. That's the group that runs Al Qaeda.
[19:17.000 --> 19:24.000]  This monster that helps spy on Trump illegally, engage in all the frauds, one of the main quarterbacks of this garbage.
[19:24.000 --> 19:33.000]  Very arrogant. He's the guy that rolls stuff out, though. He rolled out five years ago that they're chemtrailing us with additive in the jet fuel to control the weather.
[19:33.000 --> 19:39.000]  Well, now he's rolled out that indeed we need to have the Pentagon, the intelligence agencies. By the way, that's illegal.
[19:39.000 --> 19:50.000]  And every other group go after these evil domestic terror groups, then they have Antifa, then they have BLM go out and burn things down, shoot people, kill people.
[19:50.000 --> 19:54.000]  And then when the public gets mad and fights back, you're a terrorist.
[19:54.000 --> 20:01.000]  That's why they had communists marching all over the country, burning police stations last night, shooting at people, turning over cars, saying,
[20:01.000 --> 20:09.000]  we want a communist overthrow. But they never attack the billionaires. They never go to Bill Gates' house. They never go to Ted Turner's house.
[20:09.000 --> 20:17.000]  They never go to Jeff Bezos' house. They never go to any of their houses. This is their army while they're offshore and bring us down.
[20:17.000 --> 20:21.000]  So here's what Brennan had to say on MSNBC, and then we'll go to your calls.
[20:21.000 --> 20:31.000]  On the call, I was thinking today that this is the most relaxed I've been in the course of many inaugurations I've watched because I'm not responsible for it.
[20:31.000 --> 20:34.000]  But I can tell you that when I was in the government, I had white knuckles because of the nature of the threats.
[20:34.000 --> 20:41.000]  But it's so much more difficult today because of what we have seen not just over the last two weeks, but that certainly has riveted our attention.
[20:41.000 --> 20:47.000]  But because of this growth in polarization in the United States and domestic violence and white supremacist groups.
[20:47.000 --> 21:04.000]  So I know, looking forward, that the members of the Biden team who have been nominated or have been appointed are now moving in laser-like fashion to try to uncover as much as they can about what looks very similar to insurgency movements that we've seen overseas,
[21:04.000 --> 21:20.000]  where they germinate in different parts of the country and they gain strength and it brings together an unholy alliance frequently of religious extremists, authoritarians, fascists, bigots, racists, nativists, even libertarians.
[21:20.000 --> 21:32.000]  And unfortunately, I think there has been this momentum that has been generated as a result of, unfortunately, the demagogic rhetoric of people that's just a part of government, but also those who continue in the halls of Congress.
[21:32.000 --> 21:48.000]  And so I really do think that the law enforcement, Homeland Security, intelligence, and even the defense officials are doing everything possible to root out what seems to be a very, very serious and insidious threat to our democracy and our public.
[21:48.000 --> 21:54.000]  I want to read you a little bit of how Tom Freeman describes the security.
[21:54.000 --> 22:08.000]  So this is the establishment, the big corporate-funded media, saying we're going to root out the Christians, we're going to root out the libertarians, we're going to root out the Congresspeople, and they're trying to expel Cruz and Holly right now.
[22:08.000 --> 22:17.000]  I mean, this is a purge. So on a scale of one to ten, they've already brought us to about a six with their actions. Their rhetoric is an eleven, okay?
[22:17.000 --> 22:29.000]  So they mean to carry this out because no one ever stands up, no one ever stops them. So we need governors, we need senators, we need everybody to up their rhetoric in the face of this and call it out for what it is a globalist takeover.
[22:29.000 --> 22:37.000]  It's the only way to stop it. It's all back by Congress, China. It's outrageous, but they've used our openness and our normalcy bias that we're still in a free country.
[22:37.000 --> 22:42.000]  So we all just sit here and keep taking it like it's okay. It's not okay.
[22:42.000 --> 22:53.000]  And now Biden's announcing endless lockdowns, endless masks, endless force inoculations, endless federal mandates, because this is the takeover.
[22:53.000 --> 23:05.000]  It's always been a takeover. Biden orders quarantines, mandatory masks, 50-plus action items, destroy Trump's legacy, and folks, wartime powers.
[23:05.000 --> 23:17.000]  Something Trump didn't do to even stop burning cities, but they're going to do it to, quote, route out, root out the patriots that have momentum.
[23:17.000 --> 23:29.000]  They know they stole the election. They know we're the majority. They've got to stop our momentum. They've got to root us out with the Pentagon. Wow.
[23:29.000 --> 23:36.000]  So yeah, this is just the beginning, folks. They know they lost. They're going to talk about reconciliation, but it's going to be the opposite.
[23:36.000 --> 23:41.000]  He said we need to stop this uncivil war. That means he's going to intensify it.
[23:41.000 --> 23:49.000]  All right, Greg and Iowa, former military on John Brennan, go ahead.
[23:49.000 --> 23:50.000]  Hello?
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.000]  Yeah, sure, Greg. I'm going to take a call right now. Go ahead.
[23:52.000 --> 24:00.000]  Hey, Alex, praying for your brother every day. We've got a 30-year military law enforcement experience guy here.
[24:00.000 --> 24:04.000]  Yes, sir. Do me a favor. Your phone's got a little bit of problems there. Will you please back off a little bit?
[24:04.000 --> 24:06.000]  Yeah, how's this, Alex?
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.000]  Back off a little bit more.
[24:08.000 --> 24:09.000]  How you doing?
[24:09.000 --> 24:10.000]  Good. Go ahead. Thank you.
[24:10.000 --> 24:22.000]  Yeah, I still work with security and ex-military guys and military former guys, special forces guys in my line of work.
[24:22.000 --> 24:31.000]  And I'm telling you, some of them are going to do whatever the Pentagon tells them to do, whatever the state tells them to do.
[24:31.000 --> 24:36.000]  If we don't push forward with the momentum we have now, it's over.
[24:36.000 --> 24:44.000]  We can't wait for an election. We can't wait for somebody to arrest these guys because they own the system. They are the system.
[24:44.000 --> 24:49.000]  We are the Constitution. We are the Americans. We have to do this.
[24:49.000 --> 24:57.000]  Because the guys that I know on the still active duty, still in the National Guard, are going to do basically what they're called to do.
[24:57.000 --> 25:02.000]  Well, that's why it's key for guys that are out of it now to educate those that are in it.
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.000]  This isn't like, oh, just follow orders, it'll be okay. This is a communist takeover.
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.000]  Brennan is a communist. They said they want to reeducate America by bringing it to its knees.
[25:10.000 --> 25:15.000]  So, people need to understand, Greg, it's only going to get worse from here on out if people follow these orders.
[25:15.000 --> 25:18.000]  And I think the communists have been off more than they can chew.
[25:18.000 --> 25:23.000]  I think it's going to trigger real secessionist movements by states like Texas.
[25:23.000 --> 25:32.000]  And if you guys do, I'll be moving from Iowa directly to there with everything I can muster to get down there.
[25:32.000 --> 25:38.000]  We have to resist. We have to resist. We can't just pray. We can't just talk amongst ourselves.
[25:38.000 --> 25:46.000]  We have to be something they have always been, the Democrats, the government has always been, and they follow through.
[25:46.000 --> 25:49.000]  We don't follow through. We have to.
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.000]  That's right, because they lost after power and they're far and funded. Thank you so much.
[25:53.000 --> 26:00.000]  It really is good versus evil. We're going to break them back and talk to Chase the Patriot, Chris, Daryl, Scott, Michael, Carl and everybody.
[26:00.000 --> 26:03.000]  I'm going to move quickly through your phone's calls.
[26:03.000 --> 26:16.000]  But folks, we have cancer. The world has cancer. It's a global government takeover run by the Davos Group, run by the UN on their own websites and their own videos and their own books and their own statements.
[26:16.000 --> 26:26.000]  We're doing this. And we just recognize the plan and the takeover and look at how all these Fortune 100 companies and Big Tech have doubled or tripled their profits.
[26:26.000 --> 26:34.000]  Some of them have even doubled their total worth in a year off of the lockdown. This was all planned. This is modern warfare.
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.000]  Recognize it and spread the word and don't just be sheeple.
[26:38.000 --> 26:42.000]  So it's up to those of you that know what's going on to not be sheeple and warn others.
[26:42.000 --> 26:46.000]  It's cheap. They always love their servitude. They will submit to anything.
[26:46.000 --> 26:50.000]  The average yuppie woman would kill their child, if told to, by CNN.
[26:56.000 --> 27:03.000]  President Trump won in a landslide on November 3rd, but the globalists weren't going to let that happen.
[27:03.000 --> 27:13.000]  They had to have some way to repudiate the populist movement emanating from the United States and it spread across the world from the UK to Brazil.
[27:13.000 --> 27:17.000]  They were desperate. They admitted their own publications. They didn't know what to do.
[27:17.000 --> 27:24.000]  And so they put out 80 million fake ballots, violated state law and stole it better than dollars.
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.000]  And now they're coming after the president. They're coming after you. They're coming after me.
[27:28.000 --> 27:36.000]  They're shutting everybody off the internet. They're trying to totally censor us. And that's why M4 Wars is still in the fight because we knew this was coming.
[27:36.000 --> 27:43.000]  We told you this was coming. We were the first main target that we're still on air at m4wars.com and doiswars.com and band up with you.

[30:20.000 --> 30:25.000]  All of our listeners, all of our supporters, whether it be radio, TV, you name it.
[30:25.000 --> 30:34.000]  I know a lot of people heard me on the air 25 years ago, 20 years ago, and they thought, this guy's crazy.
[30:34.000 --> 30:40.000]  And a lot of stations put me on because I got high ratings for him, but they thought it was entertainment.
[30:40.000 --> 30:45.000]  Then as things got more serious, a lot of stations dropped me because they said it was too scary.
[30:45.000 --> 30:55.000]  But in the last five, six years, we've only seen exponentially more radio stations because station managers and owners remembered hearing me on other stations
[30:55.000 --> 31:01.000]  or on their station before they took me off, laying out exactly what would happen.
[31:01.000 --> 31:06.000]  And then they see it happen, they go, my God, that guy wasn't crazy and he wasn't just saying it to be shocking.
[31:06.000 --> 31:11.000]  I'm sitting here wanting to tell you what's really going to happen next.
[31:11.000 --> 31:16.000]  And I just, I just, it's so horrible. I don't even want to say it.
[31:16.000 --> 31:20.000]  I mean, it's that bad. I mean, I feel bad even telling you this.
[31:20.000 --> 31:25.000]  It's like when somebody comes to you and says, hey, I got some bad news for you.
[31:25.000 --> 31:29.000]  You want to sit down for this? You're like, just tell me, okay, your grandma just died.
[31:29.000 --> 31:34.000]  You know, this is a lot worse than that. This is our culture dying.
[31:34.000 --> 31:38.000]  But see, here's why it's important to face how much trouble we're in.
[31:38.000 --> 31:43.000]  That's the only way to get out of this. I mean, we're in super bad trouble.
[31:43.000 --> 31:48.000]  And I'm not entertaining selling out, but your brain always looks at all options.
[31:48.000 --> 31:53.000]  I was back there during the break getting a little glass of out of mineral fusion in the break room,
[31:53.000 --> 31:58.000]  extended up with some ice cubes and I was just thinking, man, Jones,
[31:58.000 --> 32:03.000]  you could still sell off the globalist anytime you want.
[32:03.000 --> 32:08.000]  And I wasn't even tempted by it, but then I thought I should come explain that to you.
[32:08.000 --> 32:13.000]  That's how real this is.
[32:13.000 --> 32:19.000]  And that's why I get so mad about the Q thing, which I'm not going to talk about a bunch more,
[32:19.000 --> 32:24.000]  but hundreds of articles, New York Times, CNN, everywhere last night.
[32:24.000 --> 32:28.000]  Oh, look, Biden got inaugurated and get taken out by the military.
[32:28.000 --> 32:33.000]  And now the military is coming for you, just like I told you.
[32:33.000 --> 32:39.000]  It was Operation Trust, Trust the Plan.
[32:39.000 --> 32:43.000]  And it was called the Plan, the Trust Plan in Russian.
[32:43.000 --> 32:48.000]  They even call it the original name.
[32:48.000 --> 32:53.000]  And it took all these real issues that were going on, but then hyped them up, put disinfo in them,
[32:53.000 --> 32:58.000]  put it in, and now I see the majority of the Q folks are saying, I'm quitting.
[32:58.000 --> 33:01.000]  I'm not going to be involved in politics or research anymore. It's all fake.
[33:01.000 --> 33:04.000]  There aren't any slave children, the globalist aren't pedophiles.
[33:04.000 --> 33:12.000]  What do you think Epstein and his island and Bill Gates and Microsoft and corrupting the scientists and all that?
[33:12.000 --> 33:14.000]  That wasn't Q that exposed that.
[33:14.000 --> 33:22.000]  That was lawyers in Florida and patriots and FBI agents that weren't bad.
[33:22.000 --> 33:24.000]  And federal prosecutors that weren't corrupt.
[33:24.000 --> 33:29.000]  And people like Alex Jones and David Ike.
[33:29.000 --> 33:31.000]  So it wasn't about who's got the credit.
[33:31.000 --> 33:38.000]  You sit there and you expose something and then a nebulous esoteric message board takes that over,
[33:38.000 --> 33:46.000]  says it's basically the president, and tells you that you're a secret agent so it could lead you into destruction
[33:46.000 --> 33:51.000]  so it could lead our movement into failure because it hates you.
[33:51.000 --> 33:55.000]  So don't get out of research just because you got suckered by Q.
[33:55.000 --> 33:59.000]  95% of it was true.
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.000]  Understand that there's the great reset.
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.000]  There's operation lockstep.
[34:05.000 --> 34:08.000]  There's event 201.
[34:08.000 --> 34:11.000]  There's State Department memorandum 200.
[34:11.000 --> 34:14.000]  State Department memorandum and public law 7277.
[34:14.000 --> 34:16.000]  All these things you can write down.
[34:16.000 --> 34:18.000]  These aren't breadcrumbs.
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.000]  These are fact crumbs.
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.000]  These aren't Q drops.
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.000]  This is reality.
[34:24.000 --> 34:27.000]  Here's another ultra drop for you.
[34:27.000 --> 34:31.000]  Whatever you want to call it, operation trust.
[34:31.000 --> 34:32.000]  Trust the plan.
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  I told them then.
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  The 1920s, rounding up all the Patriot Russians.
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.000]  They thought they were in opposition.
[34:38.000 --> 34:44.000]  And so what I'm telling you is, is they wanted to pacify Trump's support base,
[34:44.000 --> 34:50.000]  and build it up with disinfo to discredit all the real things that were being exposed.
[34:50.000 --> 34:55.000]  All the real things that grassroots researchers across this country,
[34:55.000 --> 34:59.000]  countless great people, had exposed.
[34:59.000 --> 35:01.000]  And so that's what this is about.
[35:01.000 --> 35:07.000]  It was so frustrating to talk to two lawyers that worked directly with Trump
[35:07.000 --> 35:09.000]  and talked to him in the last couple of weeks,
[35:09.000 --> 35:13.000]  and other people that are well known to come on the show that know Trump.
[35:13.000 --> 35:18.000]  And said Trump's just despondent and really defiant,
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.000]  but he knows that he's been cut off by the establishment.
[35:21.000 --> 35:22.000]  There's nothing he can do.
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.000]  He can declassify a bunch of stuff and try to educate the public.
[35:25.000 --> 35:28.000]  And he hopes that by showing them a good four years,
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  Biden won't be able to screw us as bad,
[35:30.000 --> 35:33.000]  and even said that in a speech yesterday.
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  Trump did as he was leaving.
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  We showed you a good example,
[35:37.000 --> 35:42.000]  so hopefully they won't screw you over now because people will remember that things can be better.
[35:42.000 --> 35:45.000]  Remember they told you no way we get above a 3% growth rate.
[35:45.000 --> 35:46.000]  There's no such thing as a magic wand.
[35:46.000 --> 35:54.000]  Remember that?
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  Then you got it up to 3.8%, just like that,
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  because they closed America for business.
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  You were supposed to invest in China.
[36:00.000 --> 36:01.000]  That's how globalism works.
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  They pick winners and losers.
[36:03.000 --> 36:08.000]  And so it's so frustrating to be telling you the president is stepping down.
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.000]  That's not a CG when he tells you that.
[36:10.000 --> 36:16.000]  And you wouldn't believe me that you've seen the president on the show.
[36:16.000 --> 36:20.000]  And I just want you to go off what's real, like Christ said.
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  Not things that are hidden, but things that are out in the open.
[36:22.000 --> 36:26.000]  The occult means hidden, of the devil.
[36:26.000 --> 36:33.000]  Everything of God is out in the open.
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  All right, let's go to your phone calls,
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  and I'll take more in the next segment for a couple of segments,
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  and Gavin McHenna joins us.
[36:39.000 --> 36:42.000]  And then we've got another big guest joining us,
[36:42.000 --> 36:45.000]  says, well, Steve Cuell was on last week's Super Hot Gas,
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.000]  Super Smart, the opposite of Q.
[36:47.000 --> 36:50.000]  He's not going to give you a bunch of sugar-coated crap.
[36:50.000 --> 36:52.000]  People need to know the truth or get ready for it.
[36:52.000 --> 36:56.000]  That's what's positive is to get people out of their comfort zone,
[36:56.000 --> 36:59.000]  whereby increments they accept more and more until you're dead.
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  You got to stop submitting.
[37:01.000 --> 37:02.000]  You got to stop going along.
[37:02.000 --> 37:05.000]  You got to admit how much trouble you're in.
[37:05.000 --> 37:08.000]  Man, I would read globalist documents.
[37:08.000 --> 37:13.000]  25, 30 years ago, and I just was like,
[37:13.000 --> 37:18.000]  I would read a book by a major professor or by Anthony Sutton
[37:18.000 --> 37:21.000]  that was the top congressional researcher for the Congress,
[37:21.000 --> 37:26.000]  and I still said, I can't believe David Rockefeller said in 1976
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  that communism's the way for America,
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  and he loves Mao Zedong and China's the model,
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  and we're going to bring in communism in America.
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.000]  And I went down to UT Library, and I got the microfilm out,
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  and I scanned it up, and I pulled it up,
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.000]  and I paid my $5, and son of a bitch,
[37:41.000 --> 37:42.000]  they printed it off for me,
[37:42.000 --> 37:45.000]  and I had the New York Times with him saying it.
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.000]  Now, years later, that's online.
[37:48.000 --> 37:52.000]  You can just type in David Rockefeller from a China traveler.
[37:52.000 --> 37:53.000]  There's several articles.
[37:53.000 --> 37:57.000]  He wrote 73 and 76.
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.000]  But you talk about a Q-drop.
[37:59.000 --> 38:03.000]  That's Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller saying,
[38:03.000 --> 38:10.000]  we're going to make America like communist China in the 1970s.
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  And then I read stuff where they said,
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  we're going to get rid of the biological family.
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  There'll be no males and females anymore.
[38:16.000 --> 38:19.000]  We'll use chemicals in the water and cultural controls,
[38:19.000 --> 38:22.000]  and then we'll make it illegal to ever say
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.000]  there was such a thing as men and women.
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  I read documents from the 70s that are planning that.
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  They're doing it now.
[38:30.000 --> 38:31.000]  So here's the deal.
[38:31.000 --> 38:36.000]  Back then, I was telling you what they were planning to do.
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  Now, they've been beta testing and all.
[38:38.000 --> 38:39.000]  They're going operational.
[38:39.000 --> 38:40.000]  I'm going to go to break,
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  and I promise we'll take five calls next segment.
[38:42.000 --> 38:43.000]  We'll take two more segments of calls,
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.000]  and then we've got Gavin McInnis coming on at 15 after.
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  And just separately, I'll say it again,
[38:49.000 --> 38:50.000]  we need financial support.
[38:50.000 --> 38:51.000]  The enemy is trying to shut us down.
[38:51.000 --> 38:52.000]  You see that now.
[38:52.000 --> 38:53.000]  You see me months ago saying,
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  even before the election, you better buy our products now,
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  because going to the future, we'll probably be shut down.
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  They're shutting everybody else down.
[38:59.000 --> 39:00.000]  We're dug in.
[39:00.000 --> 39:01.000]  We knew it was coming.
[39:01.000 --> 39:02.000]  So that's why we're still here.
[39:02.000 --> 39:03.000]  But believe me, we're like a bunker.
[39:03.000 --> 39:04.000]  The missiles are coming in.
[39:04.000 --> 39:05.000]  Okay.
[39:05.000 --> 39:08.000]  I use like the final matrix movie where the machines are burrowing
[39:08.000 --> 39:09.000]  into the underground base.
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  I mean, it's like,
[39:11.000 --> 39:12.000]  come to the walls.
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  I mean, you're going to find out soon.
[39:14.000 --> 39:15.000]  Lockdown is never going to end.
[39:15.000 --> 39:16.000]  Fourth snocculation.
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  Half your neighbors will be dying of cancer in five years.
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.000]  And it's just, it's just a dystopian takeover.
[39:21.000 --> 39:22.000]  It's their plan.
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  They said they're going to kill 80% of you.
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  That's in the public plans.
[39:26.000 --> 39:27.000]  So they mean business.

[44:44.520 --> 44:50.120]  called this morning to jim scott to all this i was trying to get through to anybody so that they
[44:50.120 --> 44:55.480]  could actually call these places and let them know that we're not white supremacists we're just
[44:55.480 --> 45:01.240]  families hardworking families that are of god and family and prayer and just trying to make a living
[45:01.240 --> 45:05.880]  i mean i don't know obviously you're not a white supremacist let me explain how this works if you're
[45:05.880 --> 45:11.480]  a loyal american believes in god family capitalism second amendment you're a nazi so you deserve to
[45:11.480 --> 45:17.480]  die brendan runs antifa he's a communist so notice he says now what is a nazi it's a christian

[45:24.360 --> 45:30.360]  it's everybody this is a dirty communist the number one threat to america is him and so uh
[45:30.920 --> 45:35.800]  please continue i've i've got a friend i've got a friend that works in a nursing home right now
[45:35.800 --> 45:41.880]  okay she she definitely she she doesn't vaccinate neither do i but what it is is that her mind is
[45:41.880 --> 45:48.120]  open to understanding what she's about to see the covid um people came to her to her work yesterday
[45:48.120 --> 45:53.320]  and they vaccinated all their patients last night one of her patients died last night and then one
[45:53.320 --> 45:59.640]  is actively dying right now and she has i don't know the name of these patients i don't that that's
[45:59.640 --> 46:03.880]  that's beyond but she basically no stop stop stop stop a bunch of people's family working
[46:03.880 --> 46:09.160]  nursing homes same story they've never seen anything like it uh big nursing homes have deaths
[46:09.160 --> 46:14.760]  within hours of it happening other people die a few weeks later so yes this is mainly an extermination
[46:14.760 --> 46:20.600]  operation of old people it has many different ways that it affects folks but the m rna vaccine
[46:20.600 --> 46:26.600]  is killing old people that's why it's been suspended in a bunch of european countries but not here so
[46:26.600 --> 46:30.360]  she's got to go public she has a right in the duty to go public as a whistleblower tell me what else
[46:30.360 --> 46:36.040]  she said well she's terrified but also there's there's two other people that are in my hometown
[46:36.040 --> 46:40.120]  that are i mean i'm not going to say their names but they they developed asif and one of them their
[46:40.120 --> 46:45.880]  tongues went numb and the whole her whole body was tingling who god knows what you know what's
[46:45.880 --> 46:49.880]  happening afterwards and one of them that's why they don't want this show on air they don't want
[46:49.880 --> 46:54.920]  you to have any place to call in and again the nursing homes aren't just getting the liability
[46:54.920 --> 47:00.680]  protection that vaccine makers have now if there's deaths under covet they're now getting covered even
[47:00.680 --> 47:05.640]  if somebody dies of something else a license for neglect nursing homes are seeking and winning
[47:05.640 --> 47:09.880]  immunity amid the coronavirus pandemic and now we're seeing record numbers of old die
[47:09.880 --> 47:16.760]  because they're killing them it's a plan is this not sick it's it's very sick but i'm awake
[47:16.760 --> 47:22.680]  and i will die being awake i am a god my family is i don't care what will happen i'm awake and i
[47:22.680 --> 47:27.080]  will do whatever i don't care i don't have facebook i don't have any that stuff i never have well
[47:27.080 --> 47:29.960]  kelly you're beautiful but you gotta tell everybody you gotta tell folks that this is
[47:29.960 --> 47:36.840]  happening to to do the same thing because here's the deal they knew that's why in england the national
[47:36.840 --> 47:41.400]  health service covered its ass a month ago and this all started a month and a half ago they said
[47:41.400 --> 47:46.360]  old should not take it we're having too many adverse reactions above 75 they then said under
[47:46.360 --> 47:52.600]  16 and pregnant women but that was an advisory they still have the corporations and local clinics
[47:52.600 --> 47:58.200]  bullying and telling people they have to and then they take it you understand so the fine print tells
[47:58.200 --> 48:04.360]  you this you guys pull it up national health service top advisory board the national health
[48:04.360 --> 48:09.800]  service lists three groups that should not take covid vaccine and again it's not a covid vaccine
[48:09.800 --> 48:14.840]  so so so is she freaking out that one person died after taking this and then another is sick
[48:15.720 --> 48:22.440]  well she she's aware of of vaccines and injuries she's aware of all that but seeing it for her
[48:22.440 --> 48:27.400]  own eyes like just just knowing it and then she's got nurses that are like looking at her because
[48:27.400 --> 48:32.920]  they were so proud they had to sign you know got my vaccine they're so excited but she was she she's
[48:32.920 --> 48:39.000]  so aware and and and just the just knowing that that is what's going on it's a different it's a
[48:39.000 --> 48:44.760]  different it's different it's a totally good god bless you don't stop calling to talk radio calling
[48:44.760 --> 48:50.440]  to c-span call congress have her call congress and and just point out and again you can pull it up
[48:50.440 --> 48:58.360]  up you can pull it up a top medical advisory board in the uk warns that three groups should not take
[48:58.360 --> 49:05.080]  these vaccines and it was above 75 below 16 and pregnant three groups of people advised not to get
[49:05.080 --> 49:12.520]  the Pfizer covid vaccine y'all who knows december 10th 2020 that's out of the uk okay but it's fine
[49:12.520 --> 49:16.680]  print well then why are they vaccinating the entire old folks homes they call it the priority they
[49:16.680 --> 49:23.400]  are murdering them they are murdering them they are murdering them they the military isn't coming
[49:23.400 --> 49:29.240]  the white coats are coming brainwash cult and the good white coats but tell you all this they get
[49:29.240 --> 49:35.800]  censored by big tech organized syndicated crime thank you so much folks they're going for broke
[49:35.800 --> 49:40.440]  see they're going to commit a crime so big with so much death that then all these groups will be
[49:40.440 --> 49:45.480]  corrupted by it and will now be under their control it's a system the nazis call it the cement of
[49:45.480 --> 49:49.880]  blood they would get you to commit a murder or a crime then they would own you this is before they
[49:49.880 --> 49:56.760]  came to power let's go ahead and talk to carlos in canada carlos wants to talk about john brennan's
[49:56.760 --> 50:02.680]  declaration of war against half the american people saying the military and cia will root us out
[50:03.560 --> 50:09.240]  i guess like they're rooting out the old folks go ahead carlos well yeah thank you alex i believe
[50:09.240 --> 50:15.640]  it's uh brennan is giving you a coded message what he's basically saying is this there'll be no room
[50:15.640 --> 50:22.360]  in the united states henceforth politically for a third party for any movement to come in and
[50:23.400 --> 50:29.720]  anyone else a libertarian or natives or anybody cannot organize against the two
[50:29.720 --> 50:34.840]  political parties because the two political parties alex if you stand back a little bit
[50:34.840 --> 50:42.360]  and look at what happened with uh trump you had the party leadership always uniting to make sure
[50:42.920 --> 50:50.280]  that political sausage is made of any third party candidate rosper oh ron paul bernie sanders anybody
[50:50.280 --> 50:56.360]  and trump was unstoppable but they then organized to get rid of him and they did knowing that there
[50:56.360 --> 51:02.920]  was this collusion between the congress and the senate and the two political parties the media
[51:02.920 --> 51:09.560]  piled on fearlessly knowing they could do anything the judicial stayed out because obviously this
[51:09.560 --> 51:15.560]  they understood to be a political sausage making and the political assassination worthy of a sixth
[51:15.560 --> 51:23.800]  period says ceasar was done and we witnessed it now brennan is saying listen this reminds
[51:23.800 --> 51:28.920]  everybody that when you try to come against it two political parties you're an outsider you're a
[51:28.920 --> 51:33.320]  koresh you're a you're a guy that's going to be out there uh you know wake up doing crazy
[51:33.320 --> 51:39.480]  shit taking kool aid and we're going to fix your clock do not touch this union of two parties i
[51:39.480 --> 51:44.440]  totally agree with you and it's a globalist uniparty that's coming to literally get rid of the old
[51:44.440 --> 51:48.360]  because the boomers are all getting old and they're just setting a precedent where they kill them
[51:48.360 --> 51:52.600]  with an m rna vaccine that also has a sterilizing effect on the young that's why it has five
[51:52.600 --> 51:57.800]  different viruses they have cooked up the perfect soft kill weapon my brother uh so how do we counter
[51:57.800 --> 52:05.000]  this well you know these sort of actions uh give opportunity to give rise to opportunity
[52:05.000 --> 52:11.560]  we had a president that had control of the congress and he control of the uh the senate and he control
[52:11.560 --> 52:16.840]  of the presidency and look where we are at this stage of the game look what has happened
[52:16.840 --> 52:23.800]  basically uh president trump should not at this stage give these people any excuse to blame him
[52:23.800 --> 52:31.640]  for any of their failures their philosophy their policies are failure let them wipe out in a few
[52:31.640 --> 52:38.440]  months by march 15th or 19th which will be a friday look at the stock market look at the stock market
[52:38.440 --> 52:42.680]  i'm gonna call it out all right you're gonna see what these people are going to do they're going
[52:42.680 --> 52:48.600]  to be at each other's throat within months do not under any circumstances stop them from destroying
[52:48.600 --> 52:54.040]  because in the destruction which they're good at you'll have people who will then build after
[52:54.040 --> 52:58.520]  that's why they all evil always has a criminal will to dominate and ruin and sit on top of pile
[52:58.520 --> 53:03.880]  of ashes but in the end they get swept away in the final phase by themselves in fighting you
[53:03.880 --> 53:09.000]  were totally correct but i'm telling you they came up with a systematic plan to roll out eugenics
[53:09.000 --> 53:14.920]  to roll out gene therapy but toxic gene therapy to kill old people and and they're just testing it
[53:14.920 --> 53:20.040]  out in the open look at governor qualmo killing all those folks i mean this is so cold-blooded
[53:20.040 --> 53:25.400]  what do you call a strategy where it's too evil to fail or it's so evil people can't recognize it
[53:25.400 --> 53:32.680]  then accept it and then become accomplices so then later defend it like abortion well we have to
[53:32.680 --> 53:39.160]  now you're coming to the spiritual side jesus christ told us to our faith either you have a
[53:39.160 --> 53:45.320]  spiritual life or you don't if you do you cannot do it by yourself you have to love each other

[57:04.520 --> 57:08.360]  or folks that got nursing homes and now they're trying to make everybody take the shots
[57:08.360 --> 57:14.280]  and how most people just warehouse their family they don't even care what happens to them so they
[57:14.280 --> 57:19.080]  just find out hey mom's having a convulsion or mom's dead but some people actually take care of
[57:19.080 --> 57:21.720]  their family when they're nursing home and watch over them and they're saying oh you're not getting
[57:21.720 --> 57:27.720]  the vaccine then the nursing homes are pressuring people oh you're in an at-risk group but the
[57:27.720 --> 57:32.840]  british government's advisory board said it's killing them at high rates don't take it and it
[57:32.840 --> 57:38.920]  doesn't protect you so we could open the phones up tomorrow for three four hours and just take
[57:38.920 --> 57:43.160]  calls from nursing home workers and you're not going to hear them call them with good stories
[57:43.160 --> 57:48.440]  folks this this is meant to just be this big evil that's out in the open and we all just accept it
[57:50.120 --> 57:55.720]  because the left's all been about oh let's kill old people at 75 uh zika le manual that helped
[57:55.720 --> 58:00.920]  write obama care oh let's not give them health care bill gates said on and on and on they're not
[58:00.920 --> 58:05.240]  valuable oh and little kids aren't valuable and you're not valuable and you're not essential
[58:05.240 --> 58:09.160]  all of you are not essential when you decide somebody else is in a central you've just made
[58:09.160 --> 58:17.320]  yourself essential this is so damn predatory carl in virginia you're on the air go ahead
[58:17.320 --> 58:24.760]  then michael sir yes sir alex uh i'd like to just say uh i would like to say that this is a chimera
[58:24.760 --> 58:33.080]  genocide as in you know it's just a combination of medical and also you know racial they're
[58:33.080 --> 58:38.440]  trying to spark a racial war you know another basically spitting rhetoric that's going to
[58:38.440 --> 58:43.800]  have people on the streets once again you know uh the the white knockout game you know knocking
[58:43.800 --> 58:49.080]  white people out on the streets and uh basically just pitting us against each other and i think
[58:49.080 --> 58:54.200]  it's too multifaceted to just put into one word so well that's right there is an epidemic of white
[58:54.200 --> 58:59.720]  people in europe and the u.s and canada being pushed by black people into oncoming trains
[58:59.720 --> 59:03.960]  and it's a form of execution and the knockout games killing a lot of people and it is racial
[59:03.960 --> 59:07.080]  that's because the average black person that does that not the average black person the
[59:07.080 --> 59:11.320]  average person that doesn't looks at the tv and believes there's an epidemic of blacks being killed
[59:11.320 --> 59:17.800]  by police even though the rarest way for a black man to die in the western world is by cops there's
[59:17.800 --> 59:23.640]  about 14 a year that get killed by cops in a questionable situation maybe 200 that get killed
[59:23.640 --> 59:30.920]  period i mean that oh but 2000 blacks killed 2000 you know uh blacks uh every year in chicago
[59:30.920 --> 59:35.160]  nobody cares so that's very sick it's and you're right the whole thing is a destabilization
[59:35.160 --> 59:40.040]  campaign they're hitting us at every angle locking us down telling us we're not essential massive
[59:40.040 --> 59:48.200]  increases in suicide drug use all of it increasing absolutely and it seems to be only increasing
[59:48.200 --> 59:53.560]  and you know big farmers been at it for years my uncle venice did five in vietnam three and a half
[59:53.560 --> 59:59.400]  escape p o w two time purple heart winner and stated to me do not join the military because
[59:59.400 --> 1:00:04.440]  the reason why i was over there and no matter what you were told was to collect their opium
[1:00:04.440 --> 1:00:09.000]  because the big farmer needed their opiates that's the reason why there is absolutely i had a family
[1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:14.520]  member who was a great guy and he was running operations to cover operations into cambodia
[1:00:14.520 --> 1:00:23.080]  and louse and then when the cia got caught shipping in massive amounts of opium uh he just in a one
[1:00:23.080 --> 1:00:27.400]  little case he took the fall for him and he didn't even get in trouble once he did that
[1:00:27.400 --> 1:00:31.320]  then they promoted him and he was in iran contra high level after that and they told me the exact
[1:00:31.320 --> 1:00:35.160]  same thing i remember him he would never tell me in the secret stuff he just said listen
[1:00:35.160 --> 1:00:39.880]  at the end of the day it's about children and i said what do you mean he goes it's about children
[1:00:39.880 --> 1:00:45.000]  little children orphanages in latin america and what they do to children and he said and i couldn't
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:50.280]  be part of it and got out of it so let me tell you at the end of the day john brennan it's all
[1:00:50.280 --> 1:00:57.480]  about children and folks they're not just screwing them to them it's the ultimate selfishness
[1:00:57.480 --> 1:01:02.280]  just coming to a room with a three-year-old and just take a knife and just gut their ass that's
[1:01:02.280 --> 1:01:05.960]  what joseph mingle would do he'd take four or five little kids every morning out feed them
[1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:10.760]  chocolate bars in his car get him on a country road and then he just shoot him with his luger
[1:01:10.760 --> 1:01:15.080]  that's what he did other people like to rape him other people like to stab him other people like to
[1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:20.360]  torture him to death other people like to slowly kill them other people like mingle i like to you
[1:01:20.360 --> 1:01:24.200]  know cut parts of their brains out and put it in other brains and pull their eyeballs out with
[1:01:24.200 --> 1:01:27.960]  pliers i mean that's what they do and so at the end of the day it's about torturing children
[1:01:27.960 --> 1:01:32.120]  that's what the demon wants the thing in them wants children and so just remember when you look at
[1:01:32.120 --> 1:01:36.440]  the democrats up there they want children you know joe biden just wants to have sex with them that's
[1:01:36.440 --> 1:01:40.680]  what we know his family all has sex with each other he's just a total pervert that's bad enough but
[1:01:40.680 --> 1:01:44.760]  i mean you know so he's kind of a low level he's not into pulling their eyeballs out there he's
[1:01:44.760 --> 1:01:48.040]  out with pliers all right we'll be right back in 60 seconds please stay with us

[1:03:56.200 --> 1:04:01.000]  planetary takeover using the threat of their exaggerated virus along with the threat of the
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:05.400]  giant migrant hordes that they control and the threat of economic collapse that they control
[1:04:05.400 --> 1:04:12.520]  to usher in planetary government and all of it was in documents in the 70s 80s and 90s and 2000s
[1:04:13.720 --> 1:04:17.800]  remember lew dobbs not all those secret north american union documents where it was

[1:04:21.480 --> 1:04:26.760]  crises to bring in one world government for global crises a global solution and it's an
[1:04:26.760 --> 1:04:33.000]  authoritarian world government that wants to depopulate you and make you poor and it's run
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:37.480]  by rich communists that are above the law and don't pay taxes but want you to live under communism

[1:05:40.040 --> 1:05:45.400]  out that china is celebrating their biden puppet there's three headlines right now on asia time
[1:05:45.400 --> 1:05:52.040]  which of course is the cct mouthpiece propaganda first one says the making of us empire at the
[1:05:52.040 --> 1:05:58.120]  dawning of its end the second one says biden affects buoys the hong kong stocks the 20 month
[1:05:58.120 --> 1:06:04.200]  high and the third one more disturbing says that china titan strategic control of rare earth

[1:06:31.960 --> 1:06:36.280]  trump's key trump for four years tried to stabilize the last year they shut the economy down with
[1:06:36.280 --> 1:06:41.960]  covet but trump and all of us had to point out that we can stabilize we could have business here
[1:06:41.960 --> 1:06:48.440]  there was a prohibitive globalist systems blocking it an unfair trade systems and so now
[1:06:48.440 --> 1:06:54.040]  hell's gonna hit people have to know the globalist did it please continue yes and the big thing is
[1:06:54.040 --> 1:06:57.560]  those rare earth minerals of course that's all the tech start over with your three headlines
[1:06:57.560 --> 1:07:01.480]  because i've got the similar headlines here they are celebrating they're saying it's the end of
[1:07:01.480 --> 1:07:07.160]  america uh they're saying we crushed trump goodbye scumbag i mean they are saying we control you
[1:07:07.160 --> 1:07:13.880]  now ha ha ha oh yeah it's dawning of the end of the american empire it's the hong kong stock market
[1:07:13.880 --> 1:07:19.320]  it's all 20 months high and and you know as all this negative is out there went went you kind of
[1:07:19.320 --> 1:07:23.960]  have to laugh sometimes at the for instance the brennan thing when i heard brennan listing off all
[1:07:23.960 --> 1:07:28.600]  those different groups he wants to target my mind went to the old movie blazing saddles there's a
[1:07:28.600 --> 1:07:33.880]  scene on there where they're saying bandits and robbers and card sharks and outlaws horse wranglers
[1:07:33.880 --> 1:07:39.960]  gunslingers and libertarians when exactly did standing up for the values of thomas jefferson
[1:07:39.960 --> 1:07:45.880]  becoming a bad and evil this is a communist on record he says he's a communist who's invested
[1:07:45.880 --> 1:07:50.920]  in china who literally makes money when we go down telling us it's the end of our country and
[1:07:50.920 --> 1:07:55.960]  big tech telling us america's race is in bad when big tech apple has the worst death camps
[1:07:55.960 --> 1:08:01.800]  on record in china that's mainstream news they run death camps but they fund black lives matter
[1:08:01.800 --> 1:08:07.560]  so it's okay thank you chase i appreciate your call excellent points yes it's it's it's insane
[1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:14.600]  but the average leftist a person in that control room is a great guy and he's worked here 18 years
[1:08:14.600 --> 1:08:20.440]  now his sister was a wonderful person she became a socialist and a communist and now she said i love
[1:08:20.440 --> 1:08:26.760]  gg ping i hate america i mean she'd never been to china i asked him she has no idea what it's like
[1:08:27.400 --> 1:08:32.200]  paul octon went there a couple times like four or five times and he said it's hellish
[1:08:32.200 --> 1:08:40.360]  shh old people just fall down and down the street and just maggots are all over it's boiling
[1:08:40.360 --> 1:08:46.120]  and paul's and maggots and he's got to kick the bones into the gutter at most of the big factories
[1:08:46.120 --> 1:08:50.680]  the children as young as three are chained to a power pole and defecate on the side of the street
[1:08:50.680 --> 1:08:56.360]  and then maybe get one meal at night the parents make enough money oh but here if you spank your child
[1:08:56.360 --> 1:09:01.560]  the cps takes them they're undermining us with the clarence heaven strategy okay
[1:09:04.360 --> 1:09:09.880]  let's go ahead and take another call here let's talk to michael in canada let's talk about why
[1:09:09.880 --> 1:09:17.000]  trump failed go ahead hey alex i can tell you why i think uh trump failed but first i'd like to do
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:25.480]  a little bit of a product plug the vitamin mineral fusion can you hear that yes sir oh yeah hear that
[1:09:25.480 --> 1:09:33.960]  that's just mixing it in the glass that gives me some gas for the day if you don't have it now you
[1:09:35.160 --> 1:09:39.560]  get it now 50 off infowarstores.com
[1:09:41.400 --> 1:09:49.560]  my opinion or why trump failed is early into a visit in his preschool the one thing he failed to do
[1:09:49.560 --> 1:10:02.680]  was pardon and hire and bring in julienason with julienason i mean yes he did break into
[1:10:02.680 --> 1:10:10.520]  the dod computers when he was 14 year old as an australian national yes that's a crime under his
[1:10:10.520 --> 1:10:17.080]  crime you know knows better he could have brought in a lot of the white hat community and they could
[1:10:17.080 --> 1:10:23.000]  get through a lot of these encrypted apps were all these no i hear you trump did not have anybody to
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:27.480]  help him against the cyber attack still being run by brennan and obama stay behind networks
[1:10:27.480 --> 1:10:33.320]  obama basically never really left office and so now they kept most of their people in and so now
[1:10:33.320 --> 1:10:38.520]  they'll just seamlessly continue with the third term of obama because uh but biden's really with
[1:10:38.520 --> 1:10:43.720]  obama brennan's really with obama and and the people that control obama so it's it's very very
[1:10:43.720 --> 1:10:48.920]  nasty very very very very very dangerous uh but shifting gears from a song to a song
[1:10:49.480 --> 1:10:55.240]  trump really screwed up not giving him a pardon but this is why trump didn't do it he was reportedly
[1:10:55.240 --> 1:11:01.960]  told by evil turtle mitch mcconnell that they will allow the senate trial and will convict trump even
[1:11:01.960 --> 1:11:05.240]  though it's not constitutional he's a private citizen now that they're going to go ahead with
[1:11:05.240 --> 1:11:09.240]  this trial in the senate that's why they put a hundred day on it we're going to wait a hundred
[1:11:09.240 --> 1:11:14.040]  days if we're going to go ahead and continue with trump's impeachment in the senate if he
[1:11:14.040 --> 1:11:19.160]  doesn't do what we want so see if he goes away quietly and lets them take over then they might
[1:11:19.160 --> 1:11:24.040]  leave him alone but i think that's a damically sword over his head and i don't think trump should
[1:11:24.760 --> 1:11:29.640]  let them bluff him i think trump trump but but look trump's been in the arena he's done a lot
[1:11:29.640 --> 1:11:33.240]  i'm not going to jump on the bandwagon of bashing trump uh it's just that uh
[1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:42.360]  uh certainly he should have pardoned assange early in his tendency as presidency i think that
[1:11:42.360 --> 1:11:48.200]  that would have helped him greatly and would have saved the republic well hindsight is 2020 if he
[1:11:48.200 --> 1:11:52.600]  wouldn't have fired flinn early on when they were targeting flinn as flim as a patriot i agree
[1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:58.520]  but that's all behind us now brother assange is bigger than anybody assange is the key maker
[1:11:58.520 --> 1:12:03.640]  to everything he could get into all the encrypted apps that all these backstabbing democrats and
[1:12:03.640 --> 1:12:09.000]  republicans are doing back channel chats on well the cia could have done that better than
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:13.480]  assange ever could if they weren't working for the globalists they have been vetting they set the
[1:12:13.480 --> 1:12:20.280]  cia up in 47 under british intelligence in the globalist to take america over it's been anti american
[1:12:20.280 --> 1:12:26.360]  since its inception i appreciate your call and and so people say oh my god assange is so incredible
[1:12:26.360 --> 1:12:31.320]  assange is a talented person i think a good guy overall but i mean he's nothing compared to what
[1:12:31.320 --> 1:12:35.880]  snoden put out and uh you know you've got snoden hiding out in russia all right thank you for the
[1:12:35.880 --> 1:12:41.800]  call you got a bunch of other callers christ adam scott john william jerald trint will get to a lot
[1:12:41.800 --> 1:12:48.600]  of you but first we've got the man the myth the patriot gab mcginnis joining us to talk about these

[1:13:56.920 --> 1:14:01.560]  working as hard as i can we're in such a critical time brother how are you i love you man i want to
[1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:07.480]  uh make a quick plug that dna force i love it i've been using it quite a while and i just went
[1:14:07.480 --> 1:14:11.560]  looked at the ingredients again the other day and i see that it contains corsetins
[1:14:11.560 --> 1:14:19.880]  which according to some published studies that dr mercola has cited is an ionophore similar to
[1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:25.960]  hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cells so people might want to take a look
[1:14:25.960 --> 1:14:33.400]  at that all i know is with dna force we went out and looked at these high-end products that they
[1:14:33.400 --> 1:14:37.560]  sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle
[1:14:37.560 --> 1:14:41.320]  because there's a lot of expensive product and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks and so
[1:14:41.320 --> 1:14:46.280]  we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this so thanks
[1:14:46.280 --> 1:14:49.720]  thanks for the plug
[1:14:49.720 --> 1:15:08.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:15:08.120 --> 1:15:21.320]  we are back live broadcasting worldwide gavin mcginnis is our guest i am your host alex jones
[1:15:21.320 --> 1:15:29.160]  and wow remember back in 2012 now nine years ago times flying info wars.com was sent by an army
[1:15:29.160 --> 1:15:37.400]  source leaked us army documents outlawing a plan for reeducation camps in america and about six
[1:15:37.400 --> 1:15:43.080]  months later the army officially declassified it and said it's true a plan to round up millions of
[1:15:43.080 --> 1:15:52.680]  americans and put them in camps to reeducate them about their political views now john brunnan the
[1:15:52.680 --> 1:15:58.040]  communist the guy that illegally spied on trump i already played this clip twice but he came out
[1:15:58.040 --> 1:16:04.440]  and he said we need to identify and root out that means purge christians and even libertarians he
[1:16:04.440 --> 1:16:09.480]  mixed in nazis in the middle he's just said anybody that doesn't go along with us this is
[1:16:09.480 --> 1:16:15.080]  incredible gavin mcginnis himself has basically become a political president demonized attack
[1:16:15.080 --> 1:16:20.760]  he platformed lied about and he's going to get into biden's imminent war on not just the right
[1:16:20.760 --> 1:16:26.440]  but the left as well and how he's going over domestic terrorist and anyone who supported
[1:16:26.440 --> 1:16:32.600]  trump this is the gulag in gab mcginnis's on words from censor dot tv gabin thank you so much
[1:16:32.600 --> 1:16:43.560]  for joining us uh this is incredible our lives and it's not just the government that is going to
[1:16:43.560 --> 1:16:50.040]  arrest us and send us to reeducation camps the brilliant thing about the fascists is they have
[1:16:50.040 --> 1:16:55.800]  a self police so they have their cops who are going to arrest us and and a fucked up justice
[1:16:55.800 --> 1:17:00.520]  system that that's going to throw us in jail for crimes we didn't commit but the other smart thing
[1:17:00.520 --> 1:17:05.400]  about what they do is they have your neighbors police you they have like when maxi moder says
[1:17:05.400 --> 1:17:10.920]  harass them at the gas station so now we have our own family members and this is right out of the
[1:17:10.920 --> 1:17:16.920]  soviet union our own family members our neighbors are the guy making our sandwich they're all out
[1:17:16.920 --> 1:17:24.200]  to get us to so their force is is actually much larger than what you just see in uniform well
[1:17:24.200 --> 1:17:28.120]  that's right that's always the essence of authoritarianism and you'll see the reports in
[1:17:28.120 --> 1:17:34.680]  the us and canada and australia in in the uk just one small call say i see six people they're only
[1:17:34.680 --> 1:17:39.480]  allowed to have five and they swat team and slam people's heads in the ground all for this
[1:17:39.480 --> 1:17:44.600]  exaggerated virus i mean wasn't the virus the excuse to get the martial law in and now we
[1:17:44.600 --> 1:17:48.200]  learn it's permanent and it's political because they're announcing the same thing all over the
[1:17:48.200 --> 1:17:55.400]  world we're coming out for the nationalist you know i know this barber who was in uh the midwest
[1:17:55.400 --> 1:17:59.640]  he's got tattoos all over his face including a barber pole on his nose it's a little nuts
[1:17:59.640 --> 1:18:04.920]  but he's really into confederacy stuff confederate flags and all that and uh he kept having his
[1:18:04.920 --> 1:18:13.960]  barbershop shut down so you know where he moved to experience freedom where moscow well he's in
[1:18:13.960 --> 1:18:21.400]  russia now because it's freer there i think in many ways china living in beijing i think you
[1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:27.320]  might have more free speech uh on under certain parameters than you would hear we we used to
[1:18:27.320 --> 1:18:32.840]  like that guy uh there's a book digital gulag and we used to talk about a gulag very metaphorically
[1:18:32.840 --> 1:18:38.360]  even like two years ago but now it's real now people who were there on january 6 are going
[1:18:38.360 --> 1:18:43.720]  to get rounded up innocent or not and under the auspices of catching white supremacists
[1:18:43.720 --> 1:18:47.800]  and domestic terrorists they're going to get you me everybody we're going to jail
[1:18:47.800 --> 1:18:53.800]  and there's no bottom they admit they're going to go further from there they're going to re-educate
[1:18:53.800 --> 1:18:58.680]  our children they're going to tell our little boys and early little girls they're literally coming
[1:18:58.680 --> 1:19:05.880]  after our son's testicles yeah well i mean i one of my on my when trump was first in office my
[1:19:05.880 --> 1:19:12.520]  younger boy was in pre-k and he told me he hates trump i mean he wasn't even speaking that clearly
[1:19:12.520 --> 1:19:17.000]  because he was four or three and he said i hate trump i said why do you hate him he goes because
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:22.760]  he doesn't listen so they've the k through 12 propaganda has been going on forever but
[1:19:22.760 --> 1:19:28.920]  i really feel like as of yesterday it all came to a head you know like the the the frogs boiling
[1:19:28.920 --> 1:19:34.280]  you know in on the on the frying pan we just started getting third degree burns like today
[1:19:36.280 --> 1:19:40.200]  i agree with that so do we jump out or do we embrace our destruction
[1:19:40.200 --> 1:19:47.960]  we have to keep fighting it's in our nature i mean that's woodchucks if you if you take a beaver
[1:19:47.960 --> 1:19:52.200]  and you domesticate him in your home he's going to start chewing everything that's wood around the
[1:19:52.200 --> 1:19:58.920]  house he needs to because he has to file down his teeth and we're true patriots are the same way
[1:19:58.920 --> 1:20:03.640]  we need to keep fighting they take us to court we'll fight it in court we go to we go to prison
[1:20:03.640 --> 1:20:08.360]  we'll fight from prison we'll fight to be exonerated we'll we'll file an appeal we'll just keep going
[1:20:08.360 --> 1:20:14.360]  and going and going that's that's the one good thing left in this country is that some of us
[1:20:14.360 --> 1:20:18.680]  still have grit some of us still want to fight well that was my next point what about the instincts
[1:20:18.680 --> 1:20:23.080]  of people that genetically because a lot of it is nature a lot of it's nurture but i think more
[1:20:23.080 --> 1:20:28.760]  of it is is is is nature a lot of people aren't just going to be slaves they're not going to put
[1:20:28.760 --> 1:20:32.600]  up with it they're going to instinctively fight this and a communist takeover might have worked
[1:20:32.600 --> 1:20:36.280]  in china where they were good hardworking people but had been slaves for thousands of years in
[1:20:36.280 --> 1:20:41.000]  russia they'd been under the czars for 500 years and had been basically slaves uh and they just
[1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:45.560]  replaced one form of slavery with something far worse even if america's gotten decadent and lazy
[1:20:45.560 --> 1:20:51.960]  in stupid ways the instincts are still there and this is a big flaming over the top tyranny taking
[1:20:51.960 --> 1:20:56.440]  over i mean this is a the most sickening thing i've ever seen and it announces itself i mean
[1:20:56.440 --> 1:21:01.240]  even the nazis and the soviets were kind of quiet about what they did behind the scenes these guys
[1:21:01.240 --> 1:21:08.360]  are out the open yeah well i i agree with you it's genetic and i think the reason communism flourishes
[1:21:08.360 --> 1:21:14.520]  is because there are people with communist dna there are people who like to tattle tail who like
[1:21:15.160 --> 1:21:19.960]  a lack of freedom they like decisions being made for them they don't like a menu that has too many
[1:21:19.960 --> 1:21:25.800]  things on the menu just give me the food just give me a pile of hot food i don't want anything but
[1:21:25.800 --> 1:21:31.960]  the rest of us and i would say that these these genetic communists only represent maybe 30 percent
[1:21:31.960 --> 1:21:37.800]  of our population and like 80 percent of china's population uh i think that china changed its dna
[1:21:37.800 --> 1:21:43.560]  when mal killed 80 million people he he murdered all the creative people exactly the all they killed
[1:21:43.560 --> 1:21:49.160]  all the all the leaders yeah anyone fun and that's the thing this is what makes america unique
[1:21:49.160 --> 1:21:57.720]  and the west really we've tasted fun we've tried fun if you were born in gray then when they impose
[1:21:57.720 --> 1:22:03.880]  more gray it doesn't really matter but we've we've watched blazing saddles and and richard prior
[1:22:03.880 --> 1:22:09.400]  and rodney dangerfield we've we've experienced the 80s we partied our asses off we've made jokes
[1:22:09.400 --> 1:22:16.120]  that were offensive that made people laugh we've had movies that had you know uh very controversial
[1:22:16.120 --> 1:22:20.760]  bits in them and we laughed at that too so we've experienced freedom before and now that
[1:22:20.760 --> 1:22:24.920]  they impose this gray and say you can't do this you can't say that you're going to jail if you do
[1:22:24.920 --> 1:22:30.120]  this we're we're going to have the the inclination to fight back because we know what's on the other
[1:22:30.120 --> 1:22:38.280]  side of this big gray wall and it's color you remind me of the 1984 apple ad where everybody's
[1:22:38.280 --> 1:22:43.080]  in gray marching here comes the valkyrie female in her red shorts and throws the
[1:22:43.080 --> 1:22:49.080]  sledgehammer through the big brother telescreen but that's what this is gavin i want to come back
[1:22:49.720 --> 1:22:55.000]  and get into what's happening in the world what you think biden's gonna do what he's already doing
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:58.920]  what you think about what happened to the capital and how they're again arresting joe biggs i mean i

[1:27:07.800 --> 1:27:14.440]  on the first part of the journey i was looking at all the life
[1:27:14.440 --> 1:27:22.440]  and there were plants and birds and rocks and things there were sand and hills and rain
[1:27:24.040 --> 1:27:30.280]  the first thing i met was a fly with a buzz and a stride with no clouds
[1:27:31.320 --> 1:27:36.760]  welcome back it's an experience i know other people have had because they brought it up to me
[1:27:37.960 --> 1:27:44.200]  and i had the experience four or five times a week i will wake up in the morning i've had a
[1:27:44.200 --> 1:27:49.800]  great night's sleep and i feel optimistic about the world and my feet hit the ground and i remember
[1:27:49.800 --> 1:27:54.520]  we're under lockdown we're under mask we're under globalist takeover under agenda 2030
[1:27:55.160 --> 1:28:00.520]  we're under the great reset and i just feel so sorry for the public who think they're just
[1:28:00.520 --> 1:28:06.360]  complying with something because they're heroes when really they're being inducted into a post-human
[1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:14.040]  communist system in claus Schwab and bill gates his own words but you see those are followers it really
[1:28:14.040 --> 1:28:19.080]  is up to us you could be black you could be white you could be chinese you could be hispanic who are
[1:28:19.080 --> 1:28:25.080]  leaders and who don't want to live on our knees and who do want freedom and and and and who do
[1:28:25.080 --> 1:28:30.360]  have that inner code of not being snitches and do have that inner code of recognizing tyranny
[1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:40.200]  to stand up and be strong and gavin was talking about the 1776 dna versus the 1984 dna one problem
[1:28:40.200 --> 1:28:45.240]  with 1776 dna is that we don't like to run things we don't like to dominate we don't like to have to
[1:28:45.240 --> 1:28:49.320]  stand up and fight we will so we tend to put up with stuff because we don't want to be like the
[1:28:49.320 --> 1:28:54.440]  authoritarians but we've reached the point of not submitting anymore and things have just collapsed
[1:28:54.440 --> 1:28:59.800]  into the censorship and the control and the cia director you know saying we're gonna arrest christians
[1:28:59.800 --> 1:29:05.400]  and libertarians we're gonna root you out we're gonna purge you i mean and and and now everything
[1:29:05.400 --> 1:29:11.080]  that was hidden is now being externalized hillary five years ago saying we need camps for conservative
[1:29:11.080 --> 1:29:16.360]  white men everybody laughed so they're just opening it up that hey we want to arrest these people we
[1:29:16.360 --> 1:29:21.960]  want to reprogram them now it's on every channel i mean gavin they are really planning to do this
[1:29:21.960 --> 1:29:25.320]  what do we do about it because they've never been held accountable they think they're invincible
[1:29:25.320 --> 1:29:34.200]  we have to turn it back on them you know if if if they want to use that kind of vernacular that
[1:29:34.200 --> 1:29:39.720]  that adolescent vernacular of you're a nazi or white supremacist we call them nazis and white
[1:29:39.720 --> 1:29:46.120]  supremacists you know open borders only benefits rich white men in both countries we call them
[1:29:46.120 --> 1:29:51.960]  nazis we call them fascists we call them white supremacists all these people pushing for diversity
[1:29:51.960 --> 1:29:58.360]  all other kids go to all white schools let's lambaste them on that one fact that there's two
[1:29:58.360 --> 1:30:03.000]  black kids at your school and you have a black lives matter sign on your lawn why did you move
[1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:08.600]  to an area that is so white and why your kids in all white schools if you're so forward diversity
[1:30:08.600 --> 1:30:14.520]  you're lying and we caught you uh and we have to get legal i think law fair is an important
[1:30:15.080 --> 1:30:20.200]  uh step you know i i sued the spoc it's still sitting on the judge's lap they filed um
[1:30:20.200 --> 1:30:27.560]  um uh what should i call it uh i forget what it's called the motion to dismiss the then we
[1:30:27.560 --> 1:30:32.520]  filed a motion to dismiss that anyway it hasn't moved it's a turtle sitting there but i still
[1:30:32.520 --> 1:30:38.360]  got morris d's fired the the the president to step down their top of head of legal to step
[1:30:38.360 --> 1:30:42.520]  down their top researchers stepped down i chopped the head off the snake and we didn't even start
[1:30:42.520 --> 1:30:49.800]  so the splc took a major blow just from the filing of a lawsuit uh esra levant over at the
[1:30:49.800 --> 1:30:56.360]  rebel he's suing like 50 people right now for calling him a nazi you can't roll over and take it
[1:30:56.360 --> 1:31:03.880]  and and you're right the 1776 day dna especially white dads like we we look at tv we look at
[1:31:03.880 --> 1:31:09.800]  homer simpson and it's just abuse abuse abuse and we take it because we can but eventually you have
[1:31:09.800 --> 1:31:14.760]  to go all right i that's enough with the homer simpson stuff that's enough with the constant
[1:31:14.760 --> 1:31:20.520]  telling me how to live that's enough with the silencing me controlling the the american conversation
[1:31:20.520 --> 1:31:27.800]  we've had enough this is it now and they that's where we're at right now but the biden chinese
[1:31:27.800 --> 1:31:33.480]  biden world don't trump jr just said congratulations china at the same time we're saying we've had enough
[1:31:33.480 --> 1:31:41.560]  they have never been more powerful so this is a major clash going on and don jr's right to say
[1:31:41.560 --> 1:31:45.640]  congratulations chai comes because they're the ones that really interfered they're the ones that
[1:31:45.640 --> 1:31:50.280]  really took over and and people need to understand their whole way of life the average left the
[1:31:50.280 --> 1:31:54.760]  stinks they're gonna get free money out of helping sell the country out no they just lost their whole
[1:31:54.760 --> 1:32:01.000]  future i would i would plead to every socialist just to go to china once i lived in taiwan for a
[1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:05.480]  while but we'd go to the mainland a lot to renew our visas i used to teach anguish there and we'd
[1:32:05.480 --> 1:32:13.960]  go to singapore beijing and it's there's no joy there's no quality of life they'll work for 11
[1:32:13.960 --> 1:32:19.960]  months and then go back home for chinese new year they don't see their kid for 11 months
[1:32:19.960 --> 1:32:25.560]  you're not a father at that point you're like a great grandparent or something or a cool uncle
[1:32:25.560 --> 1:32:31.320]  there's dogs in my building this is taiwan there's dogs in tiny cages being bred for food they're
[1:32:31.320 --> 1:32:36.920]  covered in blood and and they're all wet and disgusting and they they roam the streets people
[1:32:36.920 --> 1:32:43.160]  kick them if you get hit by a car there you're responsible for the person's hospital bills
[1:32:43.160 --> 1:32:46.600]  so when they hit someone in the car they just keep running over them until they're dead so they
[1:32:46.600 --> 1:32:51.240]  don't have the bills one time we were in beijing and a journalist wrote an article about police
[1:32:51.240 --> 1:32:57.640]  brutality you know what happened next the police beat him to death so this utopia you see on the
[1:32:57.640 --> 1:33:02.680]  cover of a billy brag record workers playtime where the the workers are all together in the
[1:33:02.680 --> 1:33:09.400]  fields with their giant sights isn't remotely close to true it's just dirt and grime and death
[1:33:09.400 --> 1:33:17.720]  and sewage and pollution and pain and gray this is what america is the ugliest most evil thing on
[1:33:17.720 --> 1:33:22.440]  earth because the globalists don't want a high example so people aspire to that we've got to be
[1:33:22.440 --> 1:33:28.200]  brought down so we're all in that giant globalist sludge but they're in compact cities and an armored
[1:33:28.200 --> 1:33:33.560]  countryside redoubts totally separate from us and we're all in the sludge that's their plan
[1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:38.920]  we're all gonna dress like bernie sanders and our big fat mittens and our gray coats
[1:33:38.920 --> 1:33:45.480]  if they get their way continuing here i mean this is a real dystopic takeover why do you
[1:33:45.480 --> 1:33:48.600]  think they've launched it in such earnest we knew they were planning it they were building it
[1:33:48.600 --> 1:33:53.560]  it seems like they've just gone all out because populism scared them yes you see this is the
[1:33:53.560 --> 1:33:59.800]  difference between the 70s 60 and it says in 1776 dna and the communist dna you and i want people
[1:33:59.800 --> 1:34:05.400]  to feel better like look at look at um uh donald trump's book the art of the deal the first three
[1:34:05.400 --> 1:34:09.880]  chapters are about you making more money you thriving then he talks about growing up but even
[1:34:09.880 --> 1:34:13.880]  when he's talking about his own life he's talking about how this could help you and this is how i
[1:34:13.880 --> 1:34:19.240]  collected rent and here's how you make money here you look at obama's books or michelle obama's books
[1:34:19.240 --> 1:34:24.280]  and it's all me me me me me you know you look at someone like sernovich you me we're trying to tell
[1:34:24.280 --> 1:34:29.000]  people how to improve their lives and then we want them to go about their merry way right the the
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:34.840]  other dna is the opposite all they care about his power all the bolsheviks care about his power
[1:34:34.840 --> 1:34:41.320]  the whole world can burn the whole world everyone can starve to death you think you think stalin
[1:34:41.320 --> 1:34:47.000]  cared about the about the 40 million people he starved to death he couldn't care less it's all
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:51.800]  about me and power and me me well that's it i love seeing other people do well as long as they
[1:34:51.800 --> 1:34:57.400]  didn't take it from me i see that rising all the ships the average leftist once everybody low they
[1:34:57.400 --> 1:35:01.960]  actually don't want prosperity and even study show they're like nine ten times more likely to steal
[1:35:02.600 --> 1:35:08.440]  like seven eight times were likely to lie they don't give to charity they're just frauds remember
[1:35:08.440 --> 1:35:12.760]  margaret thatcher brought that up they said she was being criticized because the gap between rich
[1:35:12.760 --> 1:35:18.600]  and poor was the highest it's ever been in britain which was true but that's because she privatized
[1:35:18.600 --> 1:35:24.200]  everything so rich and poor used to be way down here then she privatized britain and now rich
[1:35:24.200 --> 1:35:29.800]  and poor was up here the poorer were still way richer and she pointed out that mr. honorable
[1:35:29.800 --> 1:35:35.400]  speaker would rather have everyone down here and be closer together than way up here it's not that
[1:35:35.400 --> 1:35:40.040]  way in sports it's not that way in any meritocracy but the left doesn't want that they don't want
[1:35:40.040 --> 1:35:45.160]  prosperity and we have to keep fighting for it or we're never going to see it again what are your
[1:35:45.160 --> 1:35:47.880]  predictions we have one more segment i want to get another subject you want to cover but
[1:35:48.760 --> 1:35:51.320]  in 60 seconds what are your predictions for the biden administration
[1:35:53.640 --> 1:35:59.880]  open borders massive open borders a complete reinstallation of obama care all of obama's
[1:35:59.880 --> 1:36:06.440]  policies are coming back big tech is going to completely extinguish the right no more free
[1:36:06.440 --> 1:36:12.760]  speech in america they're going to start coming for our guns second amendment and the debt is going
[1:36:12.760 --> 1:36:18.040]  to explode but the economy will be doing better because they'll stop talking about covid but so
[1:36:18.040 --> 1:36:21.880]  it won't look as bad but when we sort of blink and have a look we'll go oh we are making more
[1:36:21.880 --> 1:36:27.000]  money but the taxes are going through the roof and this inflation is going to burst and we're
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:35.800]  going to be broke i agree massive inflation is here and they're announcing the end of america
[1:36:35.800 --> 1:36:40.120]  and the leftist media celebrating china it's like cutting your legs off and jumping into
[1:36:40.120 --> 1:36:45.000]  deep water and celebrating it it's totally insane why do they hate america why do they hate themselves
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:52.200]  we'll be right back three two one here we go it's back in stock it's been sold out for over

[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:35.160]  and gives you a headache this is naturally occurring it's the secret of how the quail

[1:41:21.560 --> 1:41:25.160]  of war martyrs and stuff trump came along with the populace of a lot of great stuff he wasn't
[1:41:25.160 --> 1:41:29.560]  perfect he got surrounded but now it's fashionable to bash trump i'm not doing that we got a big
[1:41:29.560 --> 1:41:35.080]  problem in joe biden but i put a headline out the live feed the show today remember we are the
[1:41:35.080 --> 1:41:39.160]  majority don't let the globalist gas like you and gabin i think that's what it comes down to
[1:41:39.160 --> 1:41:43.240]  they're out of the gate saying you're all insurrectionist we're gonna arrest everybody
[1:41:43.240 --> 1:41:47.720]  we're gonna arrest christians libertarians he wants to widen the net out i guess to scare
[1:41:47.720 --> 1:41:53.800]  everybody and and make us capitulate i i think he's bet wrong i think he takes uh our kindness
[1:41:53.800 --> 1:42:00.600]  for weakness it's it's it's the opposite it's called restraint but how do we point out that hey
[1:42:00.600 --> 1:42:05.560]  we really did win the election we have all the numbers we know the facts uh and and just let
[1:42:05.560 --> 1:42:10.120]  them know that we're not gonna bow to this next level of intimidation all their other intimidation
[1:42:10.120 --> 1:42:16.360]  has it worked i don't think this intimidation will work either yeah it's a really strange demographic
[1:42:16.360 --> 1:42:23.720]  layout isn't it there's say 20 50 to 20 of this country is radical left aoc they're in office
[1:42:23.720 --> 1:42:30.600]  their judges their supreme court they run the media so they're a very powerful uh trill minority
[1:42:31.160 --> 1:42:37.400]  and then they've told the other 30 of leftist to shut up or they're going to be in big trouble
[1:42:37.400 --> 1:42:42.280]  so they're just standing back towering now this group if they've shut up their fellow
[1:42:42.280 --> 1:42:49.000]  moderate lefties they've said the other half of the country what are what is that 160 million people
[1:42:49.560 --> 1:42:54.280]  are nazis their white supremacists they're dangerous they have to be arrested they can't
[1:42:54.280 --> 1:43:00.040]  have a voice they can't have a job and like did you hear about lore lumar by the way she was put
[1:43:00.040 --> 1:43:04.520]  on a list where she can't have a gun she had a gun at the time she didn't know she was on the list
[1:43:04.520 --> 1:43:08.200]  so she she threw the gun away when she found out she was on the list but she could have been arrested
[1:43:08.200 --> 1:43:13.480]  for having that gun so we're going to silence you we're going to arrest you with trumped up charges
[1:43:13.480 --> 1:43:20.360]  and it's all going to be under the name of stopping domestic terrorism now that can't work you can't
[1:43:20.360 --> 1:43:27.160]  vilify 160 million people they managed to vilify you know weirdos like you and me but they can't
[1:43:27.160 --> 1:43:32.920]  vilify old ladies and christians and libertarians it can't possibly work so the free market is going
[1:43:32.920 --> 1:43:37.720]  to push back elon musk is talking about his own internet where there's freedom and you can't be
[1:43:37.720 --> 1:43:44.840]  canceled we hear talk of trump starting his own mega media where you know what fox news was hoping
[1:43:44.840 --> 1:43:51.880]  to be back in obama days he could sort of pick up oan and all these other uh uh channels that cnn is
[1:43:51.880 --> 1:43:56.680]  trying to get canceled it you can't cancel half of the most powerful country in the world do you
[1:43:56.680 --> 1:44:00.600]  agree this is because they're weak they're doing all this they know they stole it they know it's a
[1:44:00.600 --> 1:44:06.920]  fraud no one will come to us in auguration i mean it's just it's a paper tiger yeah it's well that
[1:44:06.920 --> 1:44:14.040]  who craves power the weak crave power i don't crave power when i see someone doing well in a
[1:44:14.040 --> 1:44:19.000]  maserati or someone wins the lottery i high five them i go congratulations oh you sold your company
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:22.840]  for a hundred million dollars that's amazing i hope you have a good money guy i hope you're not
[1:44:22.840 --> 1:44:28.120]  going to get taxed to death that's how we feel these other people go i don't i want that money
[1:44:28.120 --> 1:44:33.880]  and it's it's really revenge of the hurt that's a term i saw recently talking about hollywood and
[1:44:33.880 --> 1:44:37.960]  how it's these sort of sexual deviants who had been ostracized in their little towns and then they
[1:44:37.960 --> 1:44:42.200]  finally moved to la and they can get revenge for feeling weird for all these years because all
[1:44:42.200 --> 1:44:45.800]  those people from little towns are coming to be stars they can get them on drugs and abuse them
[1:44:45.800 --> 1:44:50.040]  and that's why some of these guys are pedophiles because full-size you know real women reject them
[1:44:50.040 --> 1:44:55.480]  because they're so creepy so they want power over a ten-year-old girl it's sick it's revenge
[1:44:55.480 --> 1:45:01.480]  this is all about revenge and power and those aren't those aren't noble pursuits that's not a
[1:45:01.480 --> 1:45:06.200]  good thing to have in your heart let's be clear it's revenge because they have the 1984 dna they
[1:45:06.200 --> 1:45:12.600]  could be black they could be white but there is the 1984 dna the 666 dna versus the freedom dna it
[1:45:12.600 --> 1:45:20.600]  really is there revenge is poison and you carry that poison it's a real curse like the the it's
[1:45:20.600 --> 1:45:25.960]  satanic almost like telling all black people that no one likes them that they live in a racist
[1:45:25.960 --> 1:45:30.120]  country that if they study their asses off and get a degree in accounting no one will hire them
[1:45:30.120 --> 1:45:34.040]  because they're black and if someone gets up when you sit down and moves it's because they hate you
[1:45:34.040 --> 1:45:40.200]  because that's a real curse to put on someone that's that's that's cruel these are curses and then
[1:45:40.200 --> 1:45:44.040]  everybody has chips on their shoulders and then no one can work together and then it's the ones
[1:45:44.040 --> 1:45:48.920]  actually telling us all this are actually the people that are doing it on purpose that's why
[1:45:48.920 --> 1:45:54.040]  they mentioned libertarians that's why brennan mentioned libertarians because it's anti freedom
[1:45:54.040 --> 1:45:58.920]  if if i can't control the narrative then other people can go and prosper and i won't be in control
[1:45:58.920 --> 1:46:03.640]  of it i want to control everything i want to have them in these little groups it's such a macabre
[1:46:04.600 --> 1:46:08.200]  inclination i can't imagine being like that i was talking to cop the other day and we were talking
[1:46:08.200 --> 1:46:14.200]  about the splcs hate map and how you know if you've seen it before it looks like a map of mcdonald's
[1:46:14.200 --> 1:46:19.960]  i mean they're everywhere and to to think of america like that and to think of every little
[1:46:19.960 --> 1:46:25.080]  town having these eight centers where people are planning to deny the holocaust and send blacks
[1:46:25.080 --> 1:46:32.120]  back to africa and murder innocent children like to to to feel that way it's just depraved and what's
[1:46:32.120 --> 1:46:36.840]  even crazier about it is the southern prairie law center has been caught running major terror groups
[1:46:36.840 --> 1:46:40.920]  like oklahoma city and elaine city they've got billions of secret offshore bank accounts and
[1:46:40.920 --> 1:46:45.480]  they're tied into german intelligence and others so it's a very sinister anti-american
[1:46:45.480 --> 1:46:51.080]  organization that claims it's fighting racism but evidence shows secretly funding it no i creates hate
[1:46:51.080 --> 1:46:54.920]  you know when i was a kid i was a punk rocker in the 80s and there was a thing called the heritage
[1:46:54.920 --> 1:46:59.400]  foundation i believe and what happened was canada was mostly white people right there wasn't hate
[1:46:59.400 --> 1:47:03.720]  it wasn't an issue didn't come up and it's a brand new country we got our national anthem in like
[1:47:03.720 --> 1:47:10.120]  1972 or something 1980 actually the flag 1970 so anyway there's not this group of hate everyone's
[1:47:10.120 --> 1:47:15.240]  new it's it's all it's a clean slate country and so they get i don't know 90 million to fight hate
[1:47:15.240 --> 1:47:20.360]  so this company starts writing these pamphlets going we need to keep canada white we need to
[1:47:20.360 --> 1:47:26.200]  fight racism and all this stuff and they keep handing them out until young lost souls men without
[1:47:26.200 --> 1:47:32.360]  fathers start going yeah that sounds kind of cool i i guess that's true and when i was 18
[1:47:32.360 --> 1:47:38.440]  nazi skinheads were everywhere and it was created by the government with this one program and they
[1:47:38.440 --> 1:47:43.320]  do it here all the time let's someone gets online let's go kidnap the governor and eventually you
[1:47:43.320 --> 1:47:48.040]  put that up to enough people and there's going to be some sad loser who goes yeah okay that might
[1:47:48.040 --> 1:47:52.920]  give my life meaning ah we caught him we caught another domestic terrorist it's just good we're
[1:47:52.920 --> 1:47:57.320]  going to be seeing so many of these bizarre honeypots praying on the week oh that's exactly
[1:47:57.320 --> 1:48:01.160]  what the boogaloo's are and i'm not saying every member is but but clearly they all break
[1:48:01.160 --> 1:48:05.960]  into the capital they don't get in trouble but joe big's drinking a beer does i mean you can see the
[1:48:05.960 --> 1:48:12.520]  set up i mean i told prow boys i said don't go this is a trap you went on november 4th you got
[1:48:12.520 --> 1:48:18.440]  stabbed and ended up hospitalized bevelin baby had a punctured lung and the media story was police
[1:48:18.440 --> 1:48:25.000]  give prow boys preferential treatment december 13th a guy comes hunting you at harry's he you guys
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:30.600]  come outside he stabs four of you the story is white supremacists surround poor innocent black man
[1:48:30.600 --> 1:48:35.240]  what do you think's gonna happen on january 6th if you go no matter what you do if you jaywalk
[1:48:35.240 --> 1:48:39.880]  they're gonna spin that even if you get murdered they're gonna spin it and they did they did with
[1:48:39.880 --> 1:48:45.000]  that woman who who was shot but look what looks like a secret service guy she's an evil person
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:52.280]  she deserved to be shot ashley babbitt ashley babbitt it's a trap so much of this stuff is a trap
[1:48:52.280 --> 1:48:57.480]  and then when people don't show up they just make that the narrative anyway like i was talking to
[1:48:57.480 --> 1:49:01.400]  my liberal wife about this and she's like what about the truth i go honey these stories are written
[1:49:01.400 --> 1:49:07.400]  before they happen they just stick in the pieces i hadn't played this yet but front line has a new
[1:49:07.400 --> 1:49:13.480]  piece out on me and they they have three videos where i said don't attack the capital stop stop
[1:49:13.480 --> 1:49:18.120]  they edit that out and have me saying attack the capital and then edit me in from the beginning
[1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:23.800]  when i was even there i mean this is next level proud boys were there some were there as civilians
[1:49:23.800 --> 1:49:27.880]  but as a group they said we're not going don't if you're there then you're on your own you're not
[1:49:27.880 --> 1:49:32.680]  part of the club it's not a representation of the club and i saw this uh viral thing it's got
[1:49:32.680 --> 1:49:37.800]  3.2 million views and they photoshopped proud boys wearing proud boys gear at the capital
[1:49:37.800 --> 1:49:42.600]  and just made it so it's this guy dan winslow i think he writes fiction for a living and he's
[1:49:42.600 --> 1:49:47.720]  trying to sell this like trump's army is about to kill everyone they need to be arrested gabin
[1:49:47.720 --> 1:49:51.320]  you gotta come on more than every few months i'm really glad i reached out to you to come on
[1:49:51.960 --> 1:49:55.560]  i'm glad you i i guess you reached out about the particular video where i was saying if we
[1:49:55.560 --> 1:49:58.280]  don't wake up and take action this is where we're going i wasn't trying to be glum and
[1:49:58.280 --> 1:50:02.040]  doom i think i think you've gotten i think you liked it that i was being you know this is how
[1:50:02.040 --> 1:50:07.880]  bad it is yep and to everyone who's about to experience your life and my life you got to
[1:50:07.880 --> 1:50:12.200]  keep your head up and you got to get over things you can't control and you got to understand that
[1:50:12.200 --> 1:50:16.440]  the news is going to lie about you and people are going to try to frame you you got a lawyer up
[1:50:16.440 --> 1:50:21.160]  and keep your nose to the grindstone that's right because imagine if we didn't resist the left
[1:50:21.160 --> 1:50:25.560]  though they're just i mean there's no end they'll just keep going because the next most radical
[1:50:25.560 --> 1:50:30.280]  becomes the next radical and they just there's no end to it we'd be in camps
[1:50:33.080 --> 1:50:38.360]  there's can you believe everything we talked about come through now remember when we the
[1:50:38.360 --> 1:50:43.240]  fairy task exposed the bernie bros saying look if you're a nazi you got to go away to a camp and
[1:50:43.240 --> 1:50:48.760]  learn how to not not be a nazi and that sounded eccentric but it matched your 2012 scoop and now
[1:50:48.760 --> 1:50:53.720]  it's becoming normal parlance aocs they're probably going to try to glorify them and say
[1:50:53.720 --> 1:50:58.520]  they're actually really nice it's like a resort yeah what are you complaining about they're
[1:50:58.520 --> 1:51:02.680]  building them all over the world are you in directive to hold people that don't follow

[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:26.200]  understand it is a takeover of the entire species of the genetic level and now they're coming with
[1:53:26.200 --> 1:53:31.240]  dog collars and they're announcing in public schools in the u.s starting next year it will begin
[1:53:31.240 --> 1:53:36.920]  did you hear me dog collars for your children all based on a hoax all based on a lot implore wars
[1:53:36.920 --> 1:54:00.760]  continue to spread the word to fight back you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:54:00.760 --> 1:54:08.200]  the world is a dangerous place not because of evil but because of those who look on and do nothing
[1:54:09.160 --> 1:54:16.040]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance we now take you live to the central
[1:54:16.040 --> 1:54:24.840]  texas command center it's alex jones told you world government was coming told you the lockdowns

[1:54:29.160 --> 1:54:34.360]  were coming to get rid of every norm it's the takedown of civilization but i believed in you
[1:54:35.240 --> 1:54:41.240]  and i believed that god working through you you would stand up against this and and and you are
[1:54:41.240 --> 1:54:45.160]  going to stand up you have been standing up and we've had such big gains against the globalist
[1:54:45.160 --> 1:54:50.360]  they pushed back trump they stole the election trump was an imperfect vessel we all are we've
[1:54:50.360 --> 1:54:56.280]  had some incredible successes together thanks to god we've got steve quill coming up for the hour
[1:54:56.280 --> 1:55:01.480]  and then i'm going to pepper in your calls for all you they're holding patiently on these subjects
[1:55:01.480 --> 1:55:05.640]  but please try to address your point or question since you're holding over i appreciate you doing
[1:55:05.640 --> 1:55:14.280]  that to steve quill separately though let me just spend a minute or two on this because this is
[1:55:14.280 --> 1:55:21.400]  really really important bill gates along with jeff bezos and others have been buying up all the farm
[1:55:21.400 --> 1:55:26.680]  land so is tent turner but bill gates is now the biggest landowner in the united states while he
[1:55:26.680 --> 1:55:36.680]  told people last year don't invest in farmland now why is he now the biggest owner because he
[1:55:36.680 --> 1:55:45.480]  understands that all that really matters in the future is controlling real real estate particularly
[1:55:45.480 --> 1:55:51.320]  food production you can just type it in guys bill gates now largest landowner farmland owner in the
[1:55:51.320 --> 1:55:55.080]  united states that's the headline i'm looking for i'll cover it later we'll just do it later it's no
[1:55:55.080 --> 1:56:05.960]  problem um but it's just something people need to think about and the types of things they're doing
[1:56:05.960 --> 1:56:11.240]  and what they're setting up and what they're developing yeah well we'll cover it later just
[1:56:11.240 --> 1:56:14.760]  print me a lot of those we'll do it later the specific ones i wanted and i guess i wasn't
[1:56:14.760 --> 1:56:20.360]  specifically enough that line was largest farmland owner in the united states is a lot of one of the
[1:56:20.360 --> 1:56:28.200]  ones you found it that one thanks no big deal um what i do is i get too busy or too exhausted
[1:56:28.200 --> 1:56:31.640]  after the show to cut ads i was going to cut an ad live on there i do that i was going to public
[1:56:31.640 --> 1:56:37.480]  affordable food and show you those articles have it all contained not a big deal um it's it's part of
[1:56:37.480 --> 1:56:41.800]  being live on there and then directing the show while i do it's very frustrating because that
[1:56:41.800 --> 1:56:46.120]  they just have to magically know what i want i guess and get it and i kind of rant out orders
[1:56:46.120 --> 1:56:52.840]  during the break and then that ends up that problem um they are trying to shut us down and i
[1:56:52.840 --> 1:57:01.240]  suggest you go to preparewithalex.com that takes you right to the subsection of info wars store.com
[1:57:01.240 --> 1:57:05.160]  where we have really high quality storeable food the last 25 years is insurance you can eat with
[1:57:05.160 --> 1:57:09.560]  all the inflation that's coming where the globalists are investing and the things you see them doing i
[1:57:09.560 --> 1:57:14.200]  think it's a very smart move i mean if you gave us a straight up donation that would fund freedom
[1:57:14.200 --> 1:57:19.480]  and fund the fight and and fund the warning system against the globalists but this way you actually
[1:57:19.480 --> 1:57:24.840]  get high quality storeable food at the same time at preparewithalex.com or triple eight two five
[1:57:24.840 --> 1:57:32.040]  three three one three nine and i just want to be clear about this with everybody i just want to
[1:57:32.040 --> 1:57:40.760]  be absolutely crystal clear as the globalists unfold their system as their takeover operation
[1:57:40.760 --> 1:57:47.240]  accelerates it's going to become more unpopular no matter what they do that's why they're saying
[1:57:47.240 --> 1:57:51.880]  we want to arrest you if you support freedom or a christian now i think at all the church is totally
[1:57:51.880 --> 1:57:58.520]  scared saying whenever they're told i mean it's the giving in that makes it worse and so as bad as
[1:57:58.520 --> 1:58:06.120]  a lot of this news sounds as bad as all this information can be as as as frustrating as it is
[1:58:06.840 --> 1:58:11.800]  remember it's part of a human process we go through and that's what's happening all right back in
[1:58:11.800 --> 1:58:16.520]  60 seconds with steve quayle on his view on the world and biden and what's unfolding what we're
[1:58:16.520 --> 1:58:21.080]  about to see he was on last week knocked out of the park i interrupted a lot that pissed off listeners
[1:58:21.080 --> 1:58:24.840]  it irritated me when i rewatched the show he just gets me excited and i'm back at what he said but
[1:58:24.840 --> 1:58:29.720]  i'm trying to actually let him talk and let you talk coming up in the next hour stay with us we'll
[1:58:29.720 --> 1:58:34.680]  be right back and remember it's a revolutionary act to tell the truth in tyranny as george arwell

[2:00:01.240 --> 2:00:12.760]  coming to you live from the info wars dot com studios in the recaptured state of texas
[2:00:13.320 --> 2:00:22.280]  it's alex jones all right steve quail really shouldn't need any introduction
[2:00:23.320 --> 2:00:29.480]  he is our guest he's one of the original founders of the prep movement has been a talk radio host
[2:00:29.480 --> 2:00:34.600]  for 30 years or more he was the lone voice 20 years ago this is an old bio 30 years ago
[2:00:34.600 --> 2:00:39.160]  saying the chinese and russians were ultimately back there heritage of the gold he's the author of
[2:00:39.160 --> 2:00:44.040]  over 10 books with the most recent xeno genesis turning men into monsters and wrote breathe no
[2:00:44.040 --> 2:00:50.520]  evil 15 years ago an understanding of bio weapons before anyone thought it was a problem
[2:00:50.520 --> 2:00:55.080]  and it just goes on from there he's produced a lot of big national tv shows uh investigated
[2:00:55.080 --> 2:01:02.040]  major archaeological sites it goes on and on and on uh steve quail is on record as stating that we
[2:01:02.040 --> 2:01:06.600]  have moved from the realm of natural threats in the arena of supernatural guided events
[2:01:06.600 --> 2:01:11.080]  of the unseen hand of evil orchestrating world events of unfathomable proportions steve quail
[2:01:11.080 --> 2:01:18.680]  dot com gen six giants dot com and he joins us to talk about current events in a deep dive
[2:01:18.680 --> 2:01:25.080]  perspective in in in the larger context not a 35 000 foot view not a point blank view but
[2:01:25.080 --> 2:01:32.040]  actually a subatomic view of the guts of this chaos uh system that lucifer is is is launching
[2:01:32.040 --> 2:01:36.600]  and and biden and what he's done out of the gates and and you said last week it'll be a purge of
[2:01:36.600 --> 2:01:41.480]  christians and gun owners and nationalists and now the former director of the cia has said
[2:01:41.480 --> 2:01:46.680]  brennan that we need to quote root out the christians and even the libertarians he said we
[2:01:46.680 --> 2:01:52.200]  there is no place for you we are going to get you so a huge over the top declaration of total
[2:01:52.200 --> 2:01:57.960]  tyranny uh just incredible we got the secret document nine years ago that obama was planning
[2:01:57.960 --> 2:02:02.600]  reeducation camps army manual confirmed to be real people couldn't believe it now it's on every
[2:02:02.600 --> 2:02:08.840]  channel steve quail god bless and and lay it out for us well alex i think one of the things that's
[2:02:08.840 --> 2:02:14.280]  really in everyone's face right now is the fact that the warnings that a lot of people i think
[2:02:14.280 --> 2:02:21.080]  didn't really take seriously that 100 million people are destined for destruction uh if you're
[2:02:21.080 --> 2:02:26.520]  a christian if you're a gun owner constitutionalist lining up linking up with the infamous deagle
[2:02:26.520 --> 2:02:32.520]  report but what's really critical i think is the people that have got to understand the luciferians
[2:02:32.520 --> 2:02:40.040]  a global elite those who call lucifer lord lucifer are in the victory mode they're already taking
[2:02:40.040 --> 2:02:45.400]  victory laps i just sent daria for you uh something came into me today minutes ago before coming on
[2:02:45.400 --> 2:02:51.240]  with you alex about biden signing an executive order i haven't had time to check it out but
[2:02:51.240 --> 2:02:58.280]  reinstituting guillotines for capital punishment now one of the things that when when you and i both
[2:02:58.280 --> 2:03:02.360]  started you know roughly about the same time i think i was on a little longer than you but you've
[2:03:02.360 --> 2:03:09.960]  obviously gone way more energy but way in every dimension that i believe god has had your direction
[2:03:09.960 --> 2:03:15.640]  pointed to one of the things is is that the guillotines is a big deal ladies and gentlemen
[2:03:15.640 --> 2:03:22.920]  because it's a direct fulfillment of the word of god it is also the preferred choice of luciferian
[2:03:22.920 --> 2:03:29.560]  satanists to take out their enemies alex i was given by somewhat the you know uh clearance beyond
[2:03:29.560 --> 2:03:37.480]  what most people even know uh the how many guillotines are placed in different places around the
[2:03:37.480 --> 2:03:45.480]  country and fema camps to military bases 256 000 that's a lot of guillotines additionally the
[2:03:45.480 --> 2:03:49.880]  crematoriums that go along with them they're planning on incarcerating and killing a lot of
[2:03:49.880 --> 2:03:55.240]  people now a lot of people that's fear porn blah blah blah i'll see they say i'll believe it when
[2:03:55.240 --> 2:03:59.080]  they what they'll believe it when they see it i tell them if you're looking up at the blade
[2:03:59.080 --> 2:04:04.200]  your days of making a decision are probably over your minutes for making a decision so the
[2:04:04.200 --> 2:04:11.000]  supernatural evil is what people have got to understand the bible made it clear these are the
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:18.040]  end days we are watching human life being segregated and denigrated by the way two famous statements
[2:04:18.040 --> 2:04:23.560]  i know you covered this in past shows years ago but even national security advisors said by consent
[2:04:23.560 --> 2:04:31.240]  or by conquest you will be going into the new world order uh uh un religious leader i think
[2:04:31.240 --> 2:04:37.000]  spangler made the statement almost 20 years ago no one will enter into the new world order
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:44.520]  without a luciferic initiation pledging their allegiance to lucifer i want to make everyone
[2:04:44.520 --> 2:04:53.160]  understand this that everything in heliwood he l l y w o d has been in preparing us for the
[2:04:53.160 --> 2:04:59.560]  ultimate deception the ultimate slaughter and again men are being promised you'll have eternal life
[2:04:59.560 --> 2:05:05.240]  apart from god you'll add uh machine parts to you and you have the dancing robots on that's
[2:05:05.240 --> 2:05:11.880]  not the least of our worries the worries are this alex is that the human race is being i would say
[2:05:11.880 --> 2:05:18.040]  this placed into planned extinction and human beings that should know better are going along
[2:05:18.040 --> 2:05:25.880]  for the power and prestige transhumanism singularity all of the uh super soldier programs humans
[2:05:25.880 --> 2:05:33.800]  are being targeted for extinction and the vaccine is a absolute weapon of totalitarian
[2:05:33.800 --> 2:05:40.040]  destruction and we are human guinea pigs and even the elements that are composed in some of the
[2:05:40.040 --> 2:05:47.000]  vaccines are literally off world and otherworldly imagine the worst case andromeda strain being
[2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:52.680]  stuck into you along with the blood of little babies 100 million little children aborted
[2:05:52.680 --> 2:05:57.640]  and then people even in uh mainstream christian churches and well we didn't kill the babies so
[2:05:57.640 --> 2:06:01.800]  it's no problem the life is in the blood that's right it's a giant it's they know it's a giant
[2:06:01.800 --> 2:06:07.240]  ritual just like tell you in hollywood like in the golden child where the demon uh working for
[2:06:07.240 --> 2:06:12.040]  satan wants the golden child to eat the blood of a dead baby they've hidden in the porridge
[2:06:12.040 --> 2:06:17.000]  in the oatmeal that when he does that it removes god's uh protection that's all archetypes but
[2:06:17.000 --> 2:06:20.520]  but you mentioned this i'm getting overwhelmed with calls and people that work here who have
[2:06:20.520 --> 2:06:24.360]  family that work in nursing homes where they give all the old people shots and every time
[2:06:24.360 --> 2:06:29.320]  some start dying all the rest gets super sick i mean we're seeing mass eugenics on an open
[2:06:29.320 --> 2:06:37.080]  scale here well i think it's it's beyond even eugenics it's the extinction of the human race
[2:06:37.080 --> 2:06:43.240]  and it's humans believing that they're going to be given a godlike quality and a godlike
[2:06:43.240 --> 2:06:48.040]  rule and reign look we're seeing the billionaires obviously they're headed off planet you take the
[2:06:48.040 --> 2:06:54.040]  top three guys you know or three of the top four guys whether it's elin musk whether it's uh uh
[2:06:54.040 --> 2:07:00.520]  richard branson uh whether it's uh who jeff bezos or whoever and they're all in a race to get off
[2:07:00.520 --> 2:07:06.920]  the planet why right well because they know the biblical prophecy of what happens to this planet
[2:07:06.920 --> 2:07:12.920]  i can i share a neat thing about mars mars and it came out of the nazis it came through dr
[2:07:12.920 --> 2:07:18.280]  warner von brawn dr warner von brawn wrote a book a fictional book called the mars project most people
[2:07:18.280 --> 2:07:23.640]  don't understand he was nazi ss he was also the head of the first head of nasa and probably did the
[2:07:23.640 --> 2:07:30.920]  most uh uh profound writing about the future that a lot of people don't even talk to or talk about
[2:07:30.920 --> 2:07:36.280]  he wrote the book the mars project and it would be different than any government on earth and the
[2:07:36.280 --> 2:07:45.080]  name of the control over the mars whole community colony the recolonization of mars guess what it
[2:07:45.080 --> 2:07:52.040]  was called the elan elon and in those days obviously warner von brawn didn't know about
[2:07:52.040 --> 2:07:58.440]  that you know the tesla car but what's interesting is that we're watching the occultism you know i
[2:07:58.440 --> 2:08:03.960]  wrote a book you guys carried it called empire beneath the ice and i showed how the nazi advanced
[2:08:03.960 --> 2:08:13.000]  technology was directly related to the supernatural spiritual world even dr herman olberth ob rth and
[2:08:14.040 --> 2:08:19.960]  von brawn made the statement it wasn't that we nazis were any more smart or smarter than the
[2:08:19.960 --> 2:08:26.600]  people in the west the allies it's just we had help from the other side and so the entire world now
[2:08:26.600 --> 2:08:31.160]  is seeing what i would call the final rite and there are people that have written books on that
[2:08:31.160 --> 2:08:35.960]  you've interviewed some of them but the bottom line is we are in the in in my opinion we're in
[2:08:35.960 --> 2:08:41.560]  the fourth and final rite hitler's grandchildren great grandchildren they never disappeared
[2:08:41.560 --> 2:08:51.080]  and so the occult tie the occult basis of all of advanced technology and if you will the super
[2:08:51.080 --> 2:08:56.840]  race just if you if you know what the uber mensch was the supermen nicha the super race now are
[2:08:56.840 --> 2:09:03.320]  going to be genetically altered and mechanically and roboticized human beings and we're going to
[2:09:03.320 --> 2:09:08.200]  break mccloswab said just last month that a big speech to globalists and we played a few days
[2:09:08.200 --> 2:09:13.160]  ago we played clips he said he said it in english he's germany spoke he goes in the fault industrial
[2:09:13.160 --> 2:09:18.280]  it will not be the environment we change it will be you genetically reprogramming your entire body
[2:09:18.280 --> 2:09:23.320]  you're going to emerge you with it i mean they're just coming and making us do it and once they set
[2:09:23.320 --> 2:09:28.360]  the president with his coveted 19 well what's coming after that steve quail is our guests will
[2:09:28.360 --> 2:09:33.720]  talk about you know that's that's him we're not joking folks that is this cult of crazy people
[2:09:33.720 --> 2:09:38.040]  that believe they're about to be god and they're mass testing things on us the word is there's
[2:09:38.040 --> 2:09:41.800]  thousands of different things they're testing it's not just a vaccine it's a bunch of different tests

[2:12:04.040 --> 2:12:09.640]  and i do i don't go over one more than once but look at this even libertarians john brennan
[2:12:09.640 --> 2:12:15.800]  issues a list of ideologies that usm tell the military must root out and arrest i mean this
[2:12:15.800 --> 2:12:20.120]  is total declaration of war there should be congressional hearings he should be the one getting
[2:12:20.120 --> 2:12:26.280]  arrested the former director of the cia ran the whole black op against the president meanwhile
[2:12:26.280 --> 2:12:31.720]  left his call for secret police to go after trump supporters it just goes on and on tucker carlsson
[2:12:31.720 --> 2:12:36.840]  says democratic party planning a war on half of america then they're going to get the other half
[2:12:36.840 --> 2:12:43.240]  after that this is so incredible and then we've got joe biden at the lincoln memorial hours after
[2:12:43.240 --> 2:12:47.560]  he signed his executive order saying you'll be arrested if you're not wearing a mask on federal
[2:12:47.560 --> 2:12:53.160]  property period with his whole family and democrats all doing photo ops look at that there's all the
[2:12:53.160 --> 2:12:59.240]  videos of it again they all they fly to caribbean islands they don't wear masks they don't social
[2:12:59.240 --> 2:13:06.120]  visits because it's all a joke on you they admit claus schwaav admits it's about power it's about
[2:13:06.120 --> 2:13:10.520]  control it's about saying you're dirty it's about teaching you that you're a bad person
[2:13:10.520 --> 2:13:15.240]  send this article everyone you know and fight back and stop complying okay uh back to steve
[2:13:15.240 --> 2:13:19.080]  quells the shorter segment longer segment coming up steve you're giving him big picture that's
[2:13:19.080 --> 2:13:23.720]  excellent your view though you already predicted what biden would do you said he'll announce the
[2:13:23.720 --> 2:13:28.840]  purge of christians uh he actually did it i mean i knew they do it coming up but my gosh
[2:13:28.840 --> 2:13:34.920]  they're out of the gates like a mad bull i think it was important that kamala harris and others
[2:13:34.920 --> 2:13:40.200]  are on record saying within the first hundred days i think it's really critical alex that people
[2:13:40.200 --> 2:13:45.960]  take a sobriety test in the lateness of the hour it doesn't get better there's nobody coming to
[2:13:45.960 --> 2:13:51.720]  their rescue except the living god when you've got people that are used to killing babies
[2:13:51.720 --> 2:13:57.160]  and eating babies and trafficking in children all over the world doing some of the most horrible
[2:13:57.160 --> 2:14:02.760]  things that i won't even speak about yet when you have all this going on if they'll do it to them
[2:14:02.760 --> 2:14:06.440]  the little ones innocence what are they gonna do to you you gotta understand you even made the
[2:14:06.440 --> 2:14:11.880]  statement and i know you understand that's rhetorical but you made the statement there would be a
[2:14:11.880 --> 2:14:18.360]  ritual slaughter or there would be bloodshed a satanic sacrifice and that even took place when
[2:14:18.360 --> 2:14:25.000]  the when the capital was supposedly breached and ladies and gentlemen look at how the media changes
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:31.560]  all reality they're the ones that are nothing more than the hudinis from hell with all due respect
[2:14:31.560 --> 2:14:36.920]  to hudini the bottom line is is that they're coming they're telling you they're coming there
[2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:43.160]  in there that the same uh intelligence the same law enforcement agencies that would do nothing
[2:14:43.160 --> 2:14:50.600]  about trees and treachery murder gun running child trafficking every form of perversion
[2:14:50.600 --> 2:14:56.360]  known in hell now on earth they're not they wouldn't do anything because guess why they're
[2:14:56.360 --> 2:15:01.800]  listening to their leader lucifer and by the way alex these people pledged their all their
[2:15:01.800 --> 2:15:09.080]  entire lives to their lord lucifer and and they're bedazzled by the shining one and so all the way
[2:15:09.080 --> 2:15:13.800]  mark dice was about to be given a national tv show and they asked him to pledge himself the
[2:15:13.800 --> 2:15:17.640]  lucifer and i've been out in hollywood and point blank told me that's who they worship but i wouldn't
[2:15:17.640 --> 2:15:24.360]  be part of it yep and and again the the thing that's critical is i'm going to be talking about
[2:15:24.360 --> 2:15:32.200]  you know uh the the entire history of antartica i'm going to be on uh coast to coast tonight
[2:15:32.200 --> 2:15:38.200]  and that's a plug because i'm going to talk about the entire luciferian stronghold beneath the ice
[2:15:38.200 --> 2:15:42.600]  you know i wrote a book called empire beneath the ice well researched other documented guys have
[2:15:42.600 --> 2:15:49.240]  done it too but what's important is this all the eyes of the world are on antartica but what's
[2:15:49.240 --> 2:15:56.040]  happening in antartica with 30 000 earthquakes in one day 91 volcanoes now coming active if all
[2:15:56.040 --> 2:16:03.320]  the antartic ice were to melt within one week you see 270 feet of sea rise a lot of coastal
[2:16:03.320 --> 2:16:07.480]  cities would be but there's a reason why we've always heard of it you know statements like
[2:16:07.480 --> 2:16:14.120]  atlantic atlantis rising and everything but there is a reason why the and people don't understand
[2:16:14.120 --> 2:16:20.360]  this how big is antartica it's as big as north america mexico combined but the land mass and
[2:16:20.360 --> 2:16:26.600]  there's so much going on under the ice so much going on that even the historical uh submarine
[2:16:26.600 --> 2:16:32.280]  records talked about how the nazis were able to navigate into some of the most giant caverns
[2:16:32.280 --> 2:16:36.920]  and it's a stuff science fiction uh movies are made out but there's a lot of stuff i read about
[2:16:36.920 --> 2:16:40.840]  this years ago it didn't believe it so i looked up mainline histories and by the end of world war
[2:16:40.840 --> 2:16:45.960]  two the un the country's all have an agreement no one's even allowed to go into most of it
[2:16:45.960 --> 2:16:50.520]  it's all locked down no one circumnavigates it and it's all it's super and there is lots of
[2:16:50.520 --> 2:16:56.120]  stuff going on there and satellites when they do get shots show there's a lot of areas warmer than
[2:16:56.120 --> 2:17:02.200]  it's supposed to be absolutely and so uh you know someone said that won't ever happen it won't
[2:17:02.200 --> 2:17:06.920]  melt all at once i posted an article uh last week that the scientists are saying if those
[2:17:06.920 --> 2:17:12.760]  volcanoes go and here's the interesting thing the magma pool under the Antarctic continent is
[2:17:12.760 --> 2:17:19.880]  the biggest in the world so imagine this imagine in the 1500s a piri reese map showed an article
[2:17:19.880 --> 2:17:25.400]  all free of ice okay well people can argue in whatever for whatever reason they argue over
[2:17:25.400 --> 2:17:32.520]  everything but the nazis in the if you will what's called new schwaab and land the empire beneath the
[2:17:32.520 --> 2:17:38.200]  eye still control the world and you know the technology transfer between i'm sorry i'm gonna
[2:17:38.200 --> 2:17:45.400]  have to use the word but the aliens and the devils and the demons have dissuadduced so much of
[2:17:45.400 --> 2:17:50.200]  mankind that now they're getting ready for the annunciation of lucifer which the bible calls
[2:17:50.200 --> 2:17:56.600]  the antichrist and people can they can say well i don't believe that at all you better consider this
[2:17:56.600 --> 2:18:01.640]  why are all the biblical events now coming into play why are they talking about cutting everybody's
[2:18:01.640 --> 2:18:06.120]  heads off which by the way why are they now saying that the pentagon and others are going to be
[2:18:06.120 --> 2:18:12.440]  classified in nine months all the ufo stuff well they're saying because and this is important
[2:18:12.440 --> 2:18:19.480]  this is the disclosure of the prometheus factor or panspermia meaning that the aliens created us
[2:18:19.480 --> 2:18:24.520]  i did send daria i don't know if she ever showed it to you i like the the catholic church uh by
[2:18:24.520 --> 2:18:32.440]  a prologue no yeah it was their whole if you will getting the world ready to uh for the alien
[2:18:32.440 --> 2:18:39.160]  arrival okay and they'll move from space brothers to our creators and again this is why hollywood
[2:18:39.160 --> 2:18:44.360]  has been so uh how should i say this out in front of all the different science fiction
[2:18:44.360 --> 2:18:50.920]  movies for instance again invaders from mars 1953 first time they ever showed an implant
[2:18:50.920 --> 2:18:56.840]  into the back of a skull an alien implant and the invaders were from mars so you know it's
[2:18:56.840 --> 2:19:01.720]  interesting we've moved from alien implants to artificial intelligence and i tell people you
[2:19:01.720 --> 2:19:07.880]  think those dancing robots are something wait until more human like androids just like blade
[2:19:07.880 --> 2:19:14.360]  runner and all the hollywood what i would call uh pre uh programming of the human psyche start to
[2:19:14.360 --> 2:19:21.320]  take place and by the way the idea of creating a woman a love interest out of marble goes back to
[2:19:21.320 --> 2:19:28.840]  300 bc uh and before that and then it was quote the gods the demons that brought that clay like or
[2:19:28.840 --> 2:19:35.800]  that marble like statue to life so now we see that human uh interaction is being we're being
[2:19:35.800 --> 2:19:41.400]  look we're being put into solitary confinement you mentioned the new biden rule we're being separated
[2:19:41.400 --> 2:19:48.360]  from one another we don't even get to enjoy the presence of a smile because our face is masked
[2:19:48.360 --> 2:19:55.160]  we don't even get to uh breathe the fresh air of of the the god has given us we're we're having to
[2:19:55.160 --> 2:20:00.600]  exhale everything that's the state we're being held when we come back we're being held hostage
[2:20:00.600 --> 2:20:04.600]  and prepared for this great turning and being told give up your humanity you're about to merge
[2:20:04.600 --> 2:20:10.040]  with machines from claus schwaab who is the head scientist along with bill gates running the whole
[2:20:10.040 --> 2:20:17.000]  show it's clear they're doing something big and i know with their animal hybrids animal human hybrids
[2:20:17.000 --> 2:20:23.800]  they are creating things that are not human on this planet the aliens are being created the
[2:20:23.800 --> 2:20:28.760]  corona virus so this COVID-19 is five different viruses together top scientist confirmed it a

[2:23:34.360 --> 2:23:42.040]  at info wars store dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:23:54.520 --> 2:23:58.520]  all right i'm gonna cut right in here past the bumper music is time is of the essence
[2:23:58.520 --> 2:24:04.840]  you got steve quayle author researcher or the first big survivalist on with us
[2:24:05.800 --> 2:24:09.640]  and i tell you to read his stuff 30 years ago 25 years ago thought it was a little over the top
[2:24:09.640 --> 2:24:13.720]  he was a good guy now so much of it's come true and the globalists themselves aren't atheist
[2:24:14.280 --> 2:24:19.160]  they believe aliens created life here and they believe they're getting advanced
[2:24:19.160 --> 2:24:25.560]  knowledge when they take dmt interdimensionally uh this you know a divine inspiration or satanic
[2:24:25.560 --> 2:24:30.360]  inspiration that's why the nazis if you study them in mainline history it's phd level stuff but
[2:24:30.360 --> 2:24:36.200]  it's in mainline wartime reports we're doing rituals we're taking drugs and and we're trying to get
[2:24:36.760 --> 2:24:41.880]  you divine knowledge about to build super weapons and you see how that ended up for them
[2:24:41.880 --> 2:24:47.000]  so this is definitely something that uh was going on how deep it went how much they did how much
[2:24:47.000 --> 2:24:50.920]  of it they got done remains to be seen but they had underground bases all over europe they
[2:24:50.920 --> 2:24:56.120]  worked it they did set up bases and at artica and people say that stuff was still ongoing but regardless
[2:24:56.120 --> 2:25:01.880]  the eugenics global system that set up hitler was even bigger than hitler it is involved
[2:25:01.880 --> 2:25:07.160]  underground bases all over the world and in the hidden and it set up all sorts of system so uh
[2:25:07.160 --> 2:25:11.960]  looking at that in the larger picture and the occult and what's happening versus what we see in
[2:25:11.960 --> 2:25:18.040]  the bible it all meshes up doesn't it well it all matches up and the big picture and when
[2:25:18.040 --> 2:25:22.520]  before we went to break you were talking about turning men into monsters and all the biological
[2:25:22.520 --> 2:25:29.560]  experiments ladies and gentlemen the vaccine get that word out of your mind this is an absolute
[2:25:29.560 --> 2:25:36.920]  biological ongoing mutation program to destroy human dna you know a lot of people don't understand
[2:25:36.920 --> 2:25:41.880]  the basics and and this you know i don't care if an an atheist or an agnostic doesn't like this
[2:25:41.880 --> 2:25:47.320]  but the bottom line is the reason why noah and his family were spared in the arc and i want to
[2:25:47.320 --> 2:25:51.560]  argue universal flawed there are people that don't but blah blah blah the bottom line is this
[2:25:51.560 --> 2:25:58.440]  is they were the only ones that weren't corrupted by the genetic uh mutation of the fallen angels
[2:25:58.440 --> 2:26:04.040]  and alex as you know i've been spending my life pretty much uh you know either going there or
[2:26:04.040 --> 2:26:09.240]  dealing with uh researchers and anthropologists and archaeologists all over the world but the
[2:26:09.240 --> 2:26:16.920]  bottom line is is that the vaccination is initiative is nothing more than the end of mankind
[2:26:16.920 --> 2:26:24.520]  to destroy mankind to bring in the replacements for it which would be a hybridized once former
[2:26:24.520 --> 2:26:31.080]  human and this is why it's critical you don't use enzymes with the name luciferase you don't
[2:26:31.080 --> 2:26:37.160]  use a telescope named the lucifer telescope on mount graham and that post at that picture you
[2:26:37.160 --> 2:26:41.640]  posted when i sent you that report you know that's by the catholic church and those guys are all
[2:26:41.640 --> 2:26:48.680]  phd's but they also are preparing the world for the next six months it's going to be more
[2:26:49.480 --> 2:26:55.480]  more dangerous at any time in history now so this is a genetic invasion this is a genetic war
[2:26:56.440 --> 2:27:02.200]  genetic annihilation okay genetic annihilation okay bill gates vaccine
[2:27:02.200 --> 2:27:06.920]  agreeance says it all it ends i'm called luciferase this is what people have got to understand
[2:27:06.920 --> 2:27:16.520]  even in definitions even in acronyms even in uh anagrams they are allowing their uh luciferians
[2:27:16.520 --> 2:27:22.360]  worldwide to know that get it get ready and the thing that is troubling to me why wait you saw
[2:27:22.360 --> 2:27:28.200]  his bill i mean his um his us code number for the patent for the implantable microchip to track you
[2:27:28.200 --> 2:27:34.280]  when you've been injected but also it's a it's a blockchain system so you're a robot you follow
[2:27:34.280 --> 2:27:43.240]  his orders you get money that is uh patent number six zero six zero six zero right and here's the
[2:27:43.240 --> 2:27:49.800]  thing the bottom line that everybody has got is zero six zero six zero six and what i think people
[2:27:49.800 --> 2:27:56.440]  have got to understand this there is a language of the luciferians the luciferians are using whenever
[2:27:56.440 --> 2:28:03.960]  you see 33 people dead or 33 this 33 that they're they're basically saying and here's what i want to
[2:28:03.960 --> 2:28:11.080]  make clear the united states stood by christened them stood by for the slaughter of 100 million of
[2:28:11.080 --> 2:28:16.760]  what would have been your little brothers my little sisters in humanity and destroyed them
[2:28:16.760 --> 2:28:23.160]  and now alex i can tell you this there is a 100 million hitlers composed of christians
[2:28:23.160 --> 2:28:28.200]  and constitutionals and everything else that they're going for and look at it i for an eye
[2:28:28.200 --> 2:28:34.280]  we didn't speak up for the slaughter of 100 million no one will speak up for the planned slaughter of
[2:28:34.280 --> 2:28:40.680]  100 million of us and i'm telling you this ladies and gentlemen their time frame isn't years and so
[2:28:40.680 --> 2:28:47.320]  my answer is to everything it's repent that means god forgive me forgive my country since people
[2:28:47.320 --> 2:28:54.120]  look to donald trump to be their deliverer people are always looking for you okay or for me or for
[2:28:54.120 --> 2:28:58.600]  us to fight their battles but this is what you've been trying to do i've been trying to you've
[2:28:58.600 --> 2:29:04.040]  got to incorporate your efforts you've got to take the message you've got to fight for your
[2:29:04.040 --> 2:29:08.120]  families the book of nehemiah and the old testament fight for your sons fight for your
[2:29:08.120 --> 2:29:14.120]  daughters fight for your wives and look here's the thing i can hold a bible and and listen
[2:29:14.760 --> 2:29:21.160]  i'm grateful for four years we've got a president trump but here's the thing too we need to have
[2:29:21.160 --> 2:29:27.640]  counsel we need to hear not what we want to hear and i think that if i were to describe
[2:29:27.640 --> 2:29:34.840]  you know the issues i've never seen more if you will ill fated advisors and even contemporary
[2:29:34.840 --> 2:29:39.400]  ones and you have better insight to this but what happened to general flin what happened to sydney
[2:29:39.400 --> 2:29:45.320]  powell how is it they get 10 minutes and they can save his presidency yet all of those who are
[2:29:45.320 --> 2:29:50.760]  closest to him who are doing everything they can to undermine him behind his back you know
[2:29:50.760 --> 2:29:57.000]  here's the thing public perception the same public that will say what a great guy on friday
[2:29:57.000 --> 2:30:04.040]  will say crucify him on sunday it's just like jesus when you give people what they you know they
[2:30:04.040 --> 2:30:11.080]  want then they you're their favorite person when you begin to cut across what they think or what
[2:30:11.080 --> 2:30:16.280]  they want then they gotta they gotta take you out brother and you and i both know this that the
[2:30:16.280 --> 2:30:23.880]  luciferian plan is to destroy right now whatever the world population is but 90 percent of the
[2:30:23.880 --> 2:30:29.320]  world population you've quoted their quotes all the years you've been on talk radio and on on
[2:30:31.320 --> 2:30:35.480]  you know they only say 90 because the percentage that's taking part of it thinks they're going
[2:30:35.480 --> 2:30:41.160]  to be saved too the real plan is get rid of all humans absolutely and that's why i call it an
[2:30:41.160 --> 2:30:45.640]  annihilation of the human race you know again alex you gotta carry this show some of those books i
[2:30:45.640 --> 2:30:51.720]  carry one of these yeah yeah you carry this too terminated it's the end of man is here this is
[2:30:51.720 --> 2:30:56.600]  the last book i wrote and it's the last i'm gonna write and the bottom line is that the
[2:30:57.400 --> 2:31:02.200]  heads don't say here lies the human race who failed to recognize their end when it stared
[2:31:02.200 --> 2:31:06.920]  them in the face okay this is a powerful book terminated there's another book i carry here show
[2:31:06.920 --> 2:31:11.960]  us that one yeah this one is the one that's really important this is written by the way
[2:31:11.960 --> 2:31:17.160]  daniel holding susie author of this book midnight strikes judgment at least we just talked to your
[2:31:17.160 --> 2:31:21.800]  order department a minute ago on the phone but daniel holding was the only one who was saying
[2:31:21.800 --> 2:31:27.160]  biden's gonna win trump's gonna be defeated i had him on my show he's in writing he told everybody
[2:31:27.160 --> 2:31:33.400]  that months and months before and so you know this is really important because it talks about
[2:31:33.400 --> 2:31:38.040]  everything midnight strikes we're at the midnight hour and judgment on least there's only one way
[2:31:38.040 --> 2:31:44.680]  to offset the judgment of almighty god on a god rejecting lucifer embracing blood sacrificing
[2:31:45.640 --> 2:31:50.200]  to molok you were one of the first guys that even you know knew what the the club was about empire
[2:31:50.200 --> 2:31:54.040]  beneath eyes that's what i'm gonna be talking about tonight but i'm gonna tell you what buzz
[2:31:54.040 --> 2:32:00.360]  aldrin went down to an arnica what he saw that caused him to have a shutdown almost a heart attack
[2:32:00.360 --> 2:32:07.320]  links and sinks up with admiral bird you know almost 70 80 years before that let's show buzz
[2:32:07.320 --> 2:32:12.920]  aldrin i know buzz he came on the show once and we hooked up once in la and he told me he said
[2:32:12.920 --> 2:32:19.320]  look the aliens are real they have bases on mars there's an obelisk like 2001 on the one moon of
[2:32:19.320 --> 2:32:24.520]  mars uh but and he was telling me all this stuff and i and he came on my show and said some of
[2:32:24.520 --> 2:32:29.880]  that stuff that he didn't say anywhere else totally wild why do you say we are all in danger
[2:32:29.880 --> 2:32:34.600]  it is evil itself showing i guess a basically an artificial looking mountain and Antarctica
[2:32:36.200 --> 2:32:42.360]  well right but what he saw that that caused him to have the incident was a fact of basically a
[2:32:42.360 --> 2:32:48.440]  pyramid that was like a shiny metal on the outside and then one of the huge base ships
[2:32:48.440 --> 2:32:53.000]  and i'll read his exact quote look at that that's that's not that's not art i mean that's not
[2:32:53.000 --> 2:32:59.320]  that's not natural no but that's not but what he saw alex was the same base ship
[2:32:59.320 --> 2:33:04.760]  that he had seen i'm talking to spaceship alien spaceship that he had seen on the moon
[2:33:04.760 --> 2:33:10.840]  okay and so you know i i boy what a blessing you got to meet with him but i'll be talking
[2:33:10.840 --> 2:33:15.880]  about that i'll be reading some of the exact things that happened remember this the luciferian
[2:33:15.880 --> 2:33:21.320]  cover-up is the greatest greatest how you would say this magicians trick until they're ready to
[2:33:21.320 --> 2:33:27.560]  bring lucifer on and these people are all wanting to bring lucifer on he demands children's blood
[2:33:27.560 --> 2:33:31.800]  just like uh the bohemian the bottle's clear it's an alien force on the plan that wants to hurt

[2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:56.040]  uk to brazil they were desperate they admitted their own publications they didn't know what to do
[2:34:57.480 --> 2:35:00.680]  and so they put out 80 million fake ballots violated state law
[2:35:01.880 --> 2:35:06.440]  and stole it better than death and now they're coming after the president they're coming after

[2:38:11.240 --> 2:38:16.600]  at the new special boards because this is just facebook but they're actually looking at every
[2:38:16.600 --> 2:38:21.080]  facet of the 90 plus places he was banned and now they're trying to shut down all the alternatives
[2:38:21.080 --> 2:38:27.800]  where he could go coordinated criminal monopoly all right steve quail getting back to buzz
[2:38:27.800 --> 2:38:34.600]  aldrin since you mentioned him his assistant was a fan i guess he was a fan got him on the show
[2:38:35.320 --> 2:38:42.680]  he said stuff he never told anybody else about egypt and mars and monoliths in 2001 and and i was
[2:38:42.680 --> 2:38:46.520]  kind of halfway laughing during it not realizing he was really giving me something big because he
[2:38:46.520 --> 2:38:53.000]  respected me and uh then he's he said well you weren't disrespectful but you still brought up
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:38:57.960]  was a moon landing he goes i'm not coming back on and that was that but then i knew him through
[2:38:57.960 --> 2:39:02.360]  some folks in hollywood talked to him on the phone then once went and had dinner with him and
[2:39:02.360 --> 2:39:07.000]  the hollywood individuals at a steakhouse but over the phone he told me the wildest stuff
[2:39:07.000 --> 2:39:11.240]  like an hour-long conversation when i was at this hollywood person was friends with his house
[2:39:11.880 --> 2:39:16.280]  and he said he goes alex if you think i'm making up this alien stuff for any of that he goes i can't
[2:39:16.280 --> 2:39:19.480]  tell you all the classified stuff obviously but obviously you know we had a bigger space program
[2:39:19.480 --> 2:39:24.280]  and there were more people lost you know you figured that out but he said in a year they're
[2:39:24.280 --> 2:39:28.440]  going to announce that then in about six months after that that india is going to crash a probe
[2:39:29.400 --> 2:39:35.160]  into a certain area of the moon and it's going to hit with enough force they're going to have
[2:39:35.160 --> 2:39:39.320]  another probe above it that'll pick up the water vapor proving a lake that we already discovered
[2:39:39.320 --> 2:39:43.480]  we're going to let them do that and let let that happen but don't tell anybody that till it happens
[2:39:43.480 --> 2:39:47.240]  a year later the exact thing he's saying he's announced they launched the probe a few months
[2:39:47.240 --> 2:39:51.960]  later it brings up the ice proves the lake of water now i mean buzz Aldrin something else man
[2:39:51.960 --> 2:39:55.000]  so yeah get more into what he said he saw in and arduino that really freaked him out
[2:39:56.200 --> 2:40:02.200]  well first of all the bottom line is he is in my opinion a true hero and i thank god that he's
[2:40:02.200 --> 2:40:08.840]  kept him alive this long the secret space program the martian bases yes we have them the moon bases
[2:40:08.840 --> 2:40:15.480]  yes we have them the ability to jump space yes we have it the ben rich head of the skunk worked
[2:40:15.480 --> 2:40:22.120]  talked openly when and it's a farewell dinner about you know anything you can imagine he his words
[2:40:22.120 --> 2:40:27.240]  and they tried to say well he never said that but buzz Aldrin's telling the world what's coming
[2:40:27.240 --> 2:40:33.080]  and the thing that i'm told now be you know uh saying alex everything he told you i can tell
[2:40:33.080 --> 2:40:41.560]  you this i've known five people in the intelligence in and generals i mean general generals and black
[2:40:41.560 --> 2:40:49.400]  ops in the cia and in one of the guys that literally uh his job was to basically head to
[2:40:49.400 --> 2:40:55.000]  mars and he was in charge of mars security he's passed away so the idea that people still think
[2:40:55.000 --> 2:41:02.920]  of conventional Apollo rockets or satin rockets that was all a distraction even even to the point
[2:41:02.920 --> 2:41:12.200]  that dr warnevon brawn told his secretary about being able to go to altair for interesting choice
[2:41:12.200 --> 2:41:18.120]  because in altair for uh you know that's you'd have to travel faster the speed of light to get
[2:41:18.120 --> 2:41:24.440]  there and then get back for lunch and i'm not making this up the the amount of data out there by the
[2:41:24.440 --> 2:41:30.520]  way the word uh chiro for those of you who like in chiro egypt that means literally the encampment
[2:41:30.520 --> 2:41:37.240]  of mars majestic 12 that's true ladies and gentlemen i knew and whether you believe me or not i knew
[2:41:37.240 --> 2:41:42.120]  the former head of the good guys majestic 12 is split up into the magicians the bad guys and the
[2:41:42.120 --> 2:41:48.440]  magi the good guys again the idea you know and here's what jesus said jesus is talking to his
[2:41:48.440 --> 2:41:52.280]  christians the followers if i've told you earthly things you believe me not how can i tell you have
[2:41:52.280 --> 2:41:57.480]  many things and alex we're telling people earthly things that are getting ready they're coming for
[2:41:57.480 --> 2:42:03.640]  us or they want human extinction when the aliens appear it'll be like the bad episode of twilight
[2:42:03.640 --> 2:42:12.520]  to serve a twilight zone to serve mankind they want a replacement creation in the image and
[2:42:12.520 --> 2:42:18.920]  likeness of lucifer with the last vestiges of humanity and any god-given animals everything
[2:42:18.920 --> 2:42:23.880]  that god created and saw that it was good it's a total genetic total genetic rewrite so we already
[2:42:23.880 --> 2:42:27.800]  have human animal clones for 50 years all the stuff's going on they have suppressed it i'm not
[2:42:27.800 --> 2:42:31.720]  saying you're wrong to speculate on that i'm not saying you're you're you're you're you're incorrect
[2:42:31.720 --> 2:42:37.080]  all i'm saying is is that clearly the globalist want to post human world clearly they're making
[2:42:37.080 --> 2:42:41.560]  all these announcements clearly they're targeting our children clearly they're putting up the 5g
[2:42:42.120 --> 2:42:46.920]  everything they do is to destroy us and that's how you conquer something is you basically rape it
[2:42:46.920 --> 2:42:53.880]  you override it you turn it into you like the movie the thing basically absolutely and by the way
[2:42:53.880 --> 2:43:00.200]  there is 6g being proposed by a group of scientists in finland and for the record they call it the
[2:43:00.200 --> 2:43:06.200]  genesis six project genesis six the bible the sons of god the fallen angels came to earth had sex
[2:43:06.200 --> 2:43:12.200]  with the women and produced a basically a race of what became the mighty men of old and mighty
[2:43:12.200 --> 2:43:18.440]  men of renown and and again alex now look what look at sex bots okay uh you know i i want people
[2:43:18.440 --> 2:43:23.800]  to understand this that's not something new that's something out of greek mythology that's
[2:43:23.800 --> 2:43:30.280]  something that the quote greek little g's gods made they gave life to the image of the beast
[2:43:30.280 --> 2:43:36.200]  but we're right being launched into that right now in the world so the the entire let's say this
[2:43:36.200 --> 2:43:43.240]  here we go everything that god has created is being destroyed the sex dolls and here's what
[2:43:43.240 --> 2:43:48.600]  i want people to understand the sex dolls and all their tactical senses and what they can and
[2:43:48.600 --> 2:43:54.920]  can't do that's nothing but when the demons a disembodied spirit possesses them and is able
[2:43:54.920 --> 2:43:59.720]  to give life unto the beast when i say this those aren't created by god and look at the women the
[2:43:59.720 --> 2:44:06.440]  women are alienated just even the women's movement is alienating men and and i you know people are
[2:44:06.440 --> 2:44:12.200]  going to sex bots japan there are so well let's go further they're getting ready with the sex
[2:44:12.200 --> 2:44:15.480]  bots for the replicants so that's what they've really already developed what they've got is
[2:44:15.480 --> 2:44:19.080]  they want to be able to corporately create a creature that's owned by a corporation when
[2:44:19.080 --> 2:44:23.080]  they're now saying it'll still have rights but the corporation will direct it and control it
[2:44:23.080 --> 2:44:31.000]  right and uh you know i i think i'd be really wary of a beautiful android putting the squeeze on
[2:44:31.000 --> 2:44:36.040]  you is especially when they got strength you know what the strength of ten minutes what i'm trying
[2:44:36.040 --> 2:44:41.800]  to say is there's nothing new all things old solemn the wisest man that's ever lived basically said
[2:44:41.800 --> 2:44:48.120]  there's nothing new under the sun for that which will be has already been and so again what's
[2:44:48.120 --> 2:44:55.560]  fascinating to me is the fact that even the dancing robots the things we're talking about now alex
[2:44:55.560 --> 2:45:02.440]  we're trying to bring people forward into what is being planned for us but it's not only planned i
[2:45:02.440 --> 2:45:07.560]  guess i want to change my word there it's now being implemented against us if you're being forced
[2:45:07.560 --> 2:45:13.160]  through coercion that unless you take the vaccine and it's not even a vaccine you are going to
[2:45:13.160 --> 2:45:18.360]  basically not be allowed to buy anything to eat not be allowed to have any job pay your taxes
[2:45:18.360 --> 2:45:24.280]  you're going to be a non-person and as you become a non-person all of your rights all of your
[2:45:24.280 --> 2:45:29.880]  privileges are going to be taken away from you until ultimately they take your life away from you
[2:45:29.880 --> 2:45:34.360]  and that's what that's why that's why and i i saw your uh heading on one of your shows last
[2:45:34.360 --> 2:45:40.680]  week goes on with you but final broadcast i don't think people understand what the word final
[2:45:40.680 --> 2:45:46.200]  broadcast means because that which we've been allowed to speak free speech has been executed
[2:45:46.200 --> 2:45:51.400]  ladies and gentlemen and as free speech is executed then ladies and gentlemen those who
[2:45:51.400 --> 2:45:58.360]  tell the free speech they are next so we are at the point right now where we're a vanishing
[2:45:58.360 --> 2:46:03.800]  species and the only thing i know the only thing i know is people can get their heart right with
[2:46:03.800 --> 2:46:10.360]  jesus repent and then believe god to do supernatural miracles because the left the illusifarians
[2:46:10.360 --> 2:46:14.600]  they're calling on satan to give them all their power and that's how they were able to subjugate
[2:46:14.600 --> 2:46:19.720]  this great country of ours and i would say this most of the president trump's advisors in the
[2:46:19.720 --> 2:46:25.720]  spiritual realm they wouldn't even understand the majority of them unless they were on the other side
[2:46:25.720 --> 2:46:29.080]  what you and i are talking about well that's right even nasa and the pentagon and MIT came out last
[2:46:29.080 --> 2:46:34.120]  week and said okay a decade ago we tracked the the dark matter we know what it is it's another
[2:46:34.120 --> 2:46:38.680]  dimension five times more powerful than ours controlling this one and so the truth is none of
[2:46:38.680 --> 2:46:42.760]  them are agnostics none of them are atheists they all know something else is there and that's why
[2:46:42.760 --> 2:46:48.200]  there's an energy they call on that energy and it we have free will it's like opening a gate we
[2:46:48.200 --> 2:46:54.040]  have free energy we have free will we have to call on god steve quayle steve quayle.com all your
[2:46:54.040 --> 2:46:57.800]  great books materials are there i'll be looking forward to you on coast to coast a m tonight

[2:47:03.240 --> 2:47:06.600]  that's right and i shut up a little bit more but i didn't talk some it was interesting all right
[2:47:06.600 --> 2:47:10.440]  there goes steve quayle very interesting to get you thinking definitely the globalists believe
[2:47:10.440 --> 2:47:14.520]  what he's saying they just are for it now you can say well they're really going to do all this i
[2:47:14.520 --> 2:47:18.360]  don't know how much of it is actually going on how much is theoretical what they want to do but i
[2:47:18.360 --> 2:47:22.600]  know i'm not even going to tell you what i've been told i mean i've met with some high level people
[2:47:22.600 --> 2:47:30.360]  that met with trump and they were openly talking about 3d printers already on the dark side of
[2:47:30.360 --> 2:47:36.840]  the moon right across the light line this is a lot cheaper to watch tomorrow's from there and all
[2:47:36.840 --> 2:47:41.240]  sorts of stuff being built the big thing is they're doing a lot with robots and then they
[2:47:41.240 --> 2:47:44.920]  want it to be manned and but there's a lot of stuff going on definitely that we don't know about

[2:49:56.120 --> 2:50:01.240]  for 50 years it's all being announced they are literally taking over the life cycle of humans
[2:50:01.240 --> 2:50:06.120]  and making us obsolete and big corporations downplay that they own us with these gene therapy
[2:50:06.120 --> 2:50:11.800]  systems and patents that they produced do you understand it is a takeover of the entire species
[2:50:11.800 --> 2:50:16.440]  of the genetic level and now they're coming with dog callers and they're announcing in public schools
[2:50:16.440 --> 2:50:21.880]  in the us starting next year it will begin did you hear me dog callers for your children all
[2:50:21.880 --> 2:50:26.120]  based on a hoax all based on a lot implore wars continue to spread the word to fight back
[2:50:26.120 --> 2:50:44.600]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:50.600 --> 2:50:54.680]  all right jay dyer is an author comedian and tv presenter known for his deep analysis of
[2:50:54.680 --> 2:51:00.040]  hollywood geopolitics and culture his graduate work focused on psychological warfare and film

[2:51:05.400 --> 2:51:10.040]  show hollywood decoded he has been featured on numerous proper shows and podcasts in
[2:51:10.040 --> 2:51:15.480]  debates with some of the world's top debaters jaysanalysis.com jay dyer is with us i'm only
[2:51:15.480 --> 2:51:18.280]  going to be here for this segment a little bit of the next is i wanted to just talk to him a
[2:51:18.280 --> 2:51:22.360]  little bit this is a short segment some stations don't carry this got a compilation coming up with
[2:51:22.360 --> 2:51:27.480]  some of the latest build back better that's the response to the crisis they create with the
[2:51:27.480 --> 2:51:34.200]  global lockdown and the great reset uh but uh jay let's give it the trillion foot view here
[2:51:35.320 --> 2:51:39.800]  i don't go around saying aliens are real i just look at the attack on humanity and everything
[2:51:39.800 --> 2:51:44.040]  they do is alien to make us turn against our own instincts and what's good for us and how
[2:51:44.040 --> 2:51:48.200]  they tell us humans are bad now we need to be depopulated and i see how they're trying to build
[2:51:48.200 --> 2:51:53.480]  new alien life forms uh through these genetic engineering that are not of this world that
[2:51:53.480 --> 2:51:58.040]  are being made by what computers create and then artificially put together that's the same as alien
[2:51:58.040 --> 2:52:01.960]  sending us the genetic code is something that we then build here we've built the alien doesn't
[2:52:01.960 --> 2:52:06.280]  need to be teleported here it's somehow interdimensionally or through radio waves we're given
[2:52:06.280 --> 2:52:11.320]  the code and then we build it here so regardless you'd have to be a fool to say that this isn't
[2:52:11.320 --> 2:52:17.240]  an anti-human revolution what is your view on that yeah let's look to somebody like tim leary to
[2:52:17.240 --> 2:52:22.360]  really kind of solidify what you just said i just finished uh one of the leary books i'd not read
[2:52:22.360 --> 2:52:29.400]  which was his book on the tibetan book of the dead and his analogy between the experience of the soul
[2:52:29.400 --> 2:52:35.720]  right in the afterlife to the lsd trip and there's multiple chapters where leary says that what you're
[2:52:35.720 --> 2:52:41.320]  going to experience is basically the same thing the shamans of the ancient world experienced
[2:52:41.320 --> 2:52:46.760]  the indigenous tribes right they're experiencing the gods which are the same as these entities as
[2:52:46.760 --> 2:52:51.960]  these beings these clockwork elves right that uh you know you hear turns turns mckinnon talking
[2:52:51.960 --> 2:52:57.240]  about the clockwork elves right that's what timothy leary is saying is going to be the experience
[2:52:57.240 --> 2:53:03.000]  and so it is he even calls it at one point alien and he says when you interact with these entities
[2:53:03.000 --> 2:53:08.840]  one thing that may happen is that they will show you kind of dystopian worlds hell worlds hell
[2:53:08.840 --> 2:53:15.320]  scapes and all this kind of stuff in the lsd trip and so again and there's many of these you know
[2:53:15.320 --> 2:53:20.600]  john c lily many of these characters relate the same experience of interacting with these entities
[2:53:20.600 --> 2:53:25.400]  and so that to me is the best explanation of what the quote aliens are is interdimensional
[2:53:25.400 --> 2:53:33.400]  dark spiritual forces who by the way claus schwa right four years ago he put out that two minute
[2:53:33.400 --> 2:53:40.520]  viral video on on twitter that said that in the next 10 15 years one of the things that the the
[2:53:40.520 --> 2:53:47.240]  uh world economic forum projects is the contact with alien entities in life and it's all part of
[2:53:47.240 --> 2:53:52.440]  that global agenda to bring in this global technocratic order so they say it over and over
[2:53:52.440 --> 2:53:58.440]  and over even in their public writings and they've been holding this back for thousands of years
[2:53:58.440 --> 2:54:03.800]  that the shaman the egyptians the greeks were interfacing with this and the best breakdown i get
[2:54:03.800 --> 2:54:09.960]  is is advanced civilizations above that god doesn't get involved in your free will but only low level
[2:54:09.960 --> 2:54:15.320]  really nasty thugs and the scum of the universe will get involved and that's why when we follow them
[2:54:15.320 --> 2:54:19.160]  when they're really lower than us we end up building nightmares because that's what they
[2:54:19.160 --> 2:54:25.480]  build because they go against free will yeah the same message go watch people's videos on youtube all
[2:54:25.480 --> 2:54:31.320]  of the dmt trips almost everybody has a unified experience that may see different things but the
[2:54:31.320 --> 2:54:37.480]  entities tell them we gotta have a global government humans are a you know uh cancer on the planet
[2:54:37.480 --> 2:54:41.480]  they're you know they're messing up gaya we got to get rid of them we got to depopulate and only
[2:54:41.480 --> 2:54:47.000]  when you do that right what's the mythology of star trek only when you have uh you know
[2:54:47.560 --> 2:54:53.000]  scientism as your religion will there be a global federation will there be an intergalactic united
[2:54:53.000 --> 2:54:56.760]  nations where everybody's happy and when they say we believe in science it means they believe in
[2:54:56.760 --> 2:55:03.000]  the exterminism the anti-human transmission absolutely yeah by the way the bolsterism that
[2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:06.840]  you've mentioned in a couple clips i heard you talk about uh that's a great analogy for what
[2:55:06.840 --> 2:55:11.480]  we're seeing there's so many parallels to what the bolsheviks did in their operations not just q
[2:55:11.480 --> 2:55:16.680]  but even to the point of recruiting occultists the bolsheviks would use occultists there was a
[2:55:16.680 --> 2:55:20.920]  one of their one of their top intelligence guys recruited all these different cults
[2:55:20.920 --> 2:55:28.760]  to promote toxic degenerate culture let's explain that when we come back with jay dyer in the
[2:55:28.760 --> 2:55:35.240]  connection to what's currently happening and beyond
[2:55:36.840 --> 2:55:41.720]  alex jones here with some very very good news our best-selling product vitamin mineral fusion

[2:56:49.800 --> 2:56:59.880]  alex jones and i'm handing the baton to jay dyer elon musk has to be aware of those that pray to
[2:56:59.880 --> 2:57:06.520]  ai gods but the ai is just a synthetic of the interface to the rest of the dimensions which
[2:57:06.520 --> 2:57:14.520]  the mathematics and the high intensity antennas have now documented they can read a force field
[2:57:14.520 --> 2:57:20.200]  five times more powerful than our current third dimension holding us in place and they even now
[2:57:20.200 --> 2:57:23.960]  talk about remember the head of bank of america like five years ago said we're enslaved for this
[2:57:23.960 --> 2:57:28.280]  dimension we've got to blast our way out i mean it all just goes back to what we hear about lucifer
[2:57:28.280 --> 2:57:34.120]  and god and then the devil and we're told all this by the ancients and we keep seeing it repeat
[2:57:34.120 --> 2:57:38.600]  repeat repeat is it because we've experienced it before and it's implanted in our genetics
[2:57:38.600 --> 2:57:43.720]  or is it really a warning from god in the future to us in the past now living it i i think it's
[2:57:43.720 --> 2:57:48.360]  really both because christ said as we quoted earlier with steve quayle if you're not going to
[2:57:48.360 --> 2:57:52.440]  believe the things i'm telling you about the world how about believe the things i tell you about
[2:57:52.440 --> 2:57:58.360]  the heavens and so we we think of the planet as everything we can fly around it in about 25 hours
[2:57:58.360 --> 2:58:03.400]  so it's it's there's a lot going on there's a lot of dis info surrounding it a lot of bs but
[2:58:04.440 --> 2:58:08.120]  jay dyer to understand the great reset to understand what we're going into and
[2:58:08.760 --> 2:58:12.920]  claus schwa that you talk so much about devos groups saying we're going to change you in the
[2:58:12.920 --> 2:58:16.920]  fourth revolution your genetics not the world that means we're getting rid of you we're not
[2:58:16.920 --> 2:58:20.840]  having you do something different in the world we're taking away your birthright we're overriding
[2:58:20.840 --> 2:58:26.360]  you here's a compilation of the recently talking about what comes out of their great reset is their
[2:58:26.360 --> 2:58:31.000]  build back better and you'll talk about what that is there it is it's a very pertinent question
[2:58:31.000 --> 2:58:36.840]  to ask how do we build back better to build back better or whatever we have a chance to reset the
[2:58:36.840 --> 2:58:43.720]  clock and build back better than before to build back better than before remember the the terrible
[2:58:43.720 --> 2:58:50.920]  damage of covid as we try to build back from this global pandemic jobine calls it build back better
[2:58:51.560 --> 2:59:00.040]  build back better building back better to do things differently to build back better we're
[2:59:00.040 --> 2:59:07.320]  going to build it back better and build it back better to my plan to build back better
[2:59:08.760 --> 2:59:14.280]  start taking all the problems that have been created in education mental health and start to
[2:59:14.280 --> 2:59:22.360]  to build back in a positive way i have launched a booklet called build back better written off the
[2:59:22.360 --> 2:59:30.680]  coronavirus it's about building this country back so they destroy it growing conspiracy following
[2:59:30.680 --> 2:59:39.000]  it it is called the great reset unprecedented opportunity to rethink and reset the ways in
[2:59:39.000 --> 2:59:46.680]  which we live the great opportunity for reset the theory even calls mr biden's campaign slogan
[2:59:46.680 --> 2:59:54.280]  build back better a front for the conspiracy build back better building back better our economy
[2:59:55.080 --> 3:00:03.080]  build back better all elements of the great reset are fundamental to building the future
[3:00:03.080 --> 3:00:13.480]  we need this pandemic has provided an opportunity for a reset it's a big effort to some would say
[3:00:13.480 --> 3:00:22.600]  to build back better we would say to really have a great reset conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy
[3:00:23.080 --> 3:00:33.080]  there's a level of admiration i actually have for china um because their basic dictatorship
[3:00:33.080 --> 3:00:39.480]  is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime so when you hear
[3:00:39.480 --> 3:00:44.200]  your great reset it means shut the world economy all the big bank corporations double their profits
[3:00:44.200 --> 3:00:48.520]  and you go bankrupt and when they build back better it's forced inoculations checkpoints
[3:00:48.520 --> 3:00:52.680]  coveted forced shots mass death killing old people with the vaccines which is now being
[3:00:52.680 --> 3:00:57.000]  announced it's it's literal hell on earth and so they went to the big corporate explain to
[3:00:57.000 --> 3:01:01.560]  this consortium is and how do you think it's going for them one year in to the launch of their
[3:01:01.560 --> 3:01:10.920]  takedown of civilization the consortium is a global confederation of banks of fortune 100
[3:01:11.400 --> 3:01:19.000]  of old nobility families all kind of working together with a plethora army of think tanks
[3:01:19.000 --> 3:01:24.200]  that sort of plan this stuff and they plan the future even if you look at entities like
[3:01:24.200 --> 3:01:28.280]  rain corporation brookings institute that's like the brains and then you've got the
[3:01:28.280 --> 3:01:33.640]  the kind of the money that the old money power behind this and they believe in a austerity
[3:01:33.640 --> 3:01:38.440]  plan right remember many years ago 10 years ago right after the housing bubble collapsed
[3:01:38.440 --> 3:01:43.000]  a lot of people were talking about a planned collapse that this was intentional right there
[3:01:43.000 --> 3:01:46.920]  were books written by people like john perkins you know economic hit convention of an economic
[3:01:46.920 --> 3:01:52.600]  hit man that dealt with how you implode economies you've covered the greg palace piece of you know
[3:01:52.600 --> 3:01:58.520]  back all the way to 2003 or four where he talked about the four stage five stage imf plan of how you
[3:01:58.520 --> 3:02:03.960]  wreck economies and then buy them out when they're basically everything is a fire sale right now what
[3:02:03.960 --> 3:02:10.840]  they're doing is that that same model on a global scale to basically create a necessary austerity
[3:02:10.840 --> 3:02:15.720]  situation where everybody's poor everybody's broke everybody's gonna have to look to this central
[3:02:15.720 --> 3:02:21.000]  authority right to get their basic means of livelihood and sustenance and it was all by
[3:02:21.000 --> 3:02:26.120]  design that's right they want a global marshal plan so bad that everything's owned by them and
[3:02:26.120 --> 3:02:30.680]  then they admit then they just start making it worse once we're bankrupt and start making us
[3:02:30.680 --> 3:02:36.280]  have a universal income to dictate uh forced inoculations one child policies i mean things just
[3:02:36.280 --> 3:02:42.440]  get worse you give into this it just gets worse right it's the same model as you know when the
[3:02:42.440 --> 3:02:48.920]  os s went in and set up mouths gorillas right bill donovan the beginning of the os s he goes in
[3:02:48.920 --> 3:02:56.360]  and he sets up that spy network for for mal right and these are just the old opium networks in lanes
[3:02:56.360 --> 3:03:00.520]  where they would where they would import the drugs this is how the old families got rich if you
[3:03:00.520 --> 3:03:04.280]  didn't know this by the way if you read a book like doping it's just a bunch of opium they didn't
[3:03:04.280 --> 3:03:08.360]  just set up china for no reason they'd broken china up in 11 parts the different western
[3:03:08.360 --> 3:03:12.760]  governments controlled so the west already ran it when the japanese tried to come in we blocked them
[3:03:12.760 --> 3:03:18.440]  then set up the communists took to run a communalized slave camp uh uh forest john birch was an army
[3:03:18.440 --> 3:03:22.120]  officer tried to fight it so they tortured him to death three at the john birch society and so again
[3:03:22.120 --> 3:03:27.640]  exactly that that's why they chose china as the engine of world dominance yeah because it was a
[3:03:27.640 --> 3:03:34.520]  perfect model an engine to transport the uh industrial base out of the west and into eurasia
[3:03:34.520 --> 3:03:38.680]  and in fact birch and russell a long time ago talked about this he said that eurasia could be the
[3:03:38.680 --> 3:03:43.640]  future of the royal society many many years ago had planned all this out from that heartland
[3:03:43.640 --> 3:03:48.440]  theory perspective if you control eurasia you can you can shift the globe and that was the
[3:03:48.440 --> 3:03:53.560]  british empire's old model of how to do geopolitics right the macindor heartland does they big control
[3:03:53.560 --> 3:03:59.160]  people through india and china before they were just continuing that model exactly and so now that
[3:03:59.160 --> 3:04:05.000]  model of what they would do in the great game is what they're doing globally once you understand
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:09.080]  that it all makes perfect sense that's why they want to wreck the economies they want to toxify
[3:04:09.080 --> 3:04:14.360]  the culture they want to make you completely dependent on not just a you know big daddy
[3:04:14.360 --> 3:04:20.040]  uncle sam government but on a global federation government that will be run by trump was only
[3:04:20.040 --> 3:04:24.920]  allowed to get in because china got a little opening of what the following order is to show them what
[3:04:24.920 --> 3:04:29.160]  the globals could do once they kind of got under globalist control then they removed trump
[3:04:29.160 --> 3:04:32.760]  that was all trump was used as kind of break pads on the chinese that was about it
[3:04:32.760 --> 3:04:39.160]  yeah and i think it was great that he uh you know undercut the power of the media the media is one
[3:04:39.160 --> 3:04:43.720]  of the main ways that the elite have the stranglehold on this country i mean they've they've been able
[3:04:43.720 --> 3:04:48.760]  to do what virgin russell said make people believe that snow is black just if they say so make people
[3:04:48.760 --> 3:04:54.440]  love their servitude right yeah that's what uh huxley talked about he said that the final revolution
[3:04:54.440 --> 3:04:59.720]  would be this anti-human revolution that they would use big pharma pharmacology right to pharma
[3:04:59.720 --> 3:05:05.640]  kia to basically put a sorcerer spell on everybody so that they would be you know doped and and and
[3:05:05.640 --> 3:05:10.920]  we're kind of getting what we got what the british empire gave to the to the chinese right the mass
[3:05:10.920 --> 3:05:15.720]  drugging through big pharma and through illegal drugs uh if you've never heard the doctor day
[3:05:15.720 --> 3:05:21.800]  tapes those are a great example of how back in the late 60s the rockefeller medical establishment
[3:05:21.800 --> 3:05:27.480]  had planned not just to control everybody through pharmaceuticals but also through
[3:05:27.480 --> 3:05:32.680]  promoting mass illegal drug use right so it's a pressure from above pressure from below model
[3:05:33.400 --> 3:05:39.320]  as you know and this leads to that synthesis right dialectical synthesis uh uh that that
[3:05:39.320 --> 3:05:44.200]  converges into what they call a third way so the easiest way they're going to collapse society and
[3:05:44.200 --> 3:05:48.680]  then bring in a hyper authoritarianism on the back of it they're going to make us all infertile
[3:05:48.680 --> 3:05:53.800]  and make all birth now a genetic chimera produced by the corporations then they capture the entire
[3:05:53.800 --> 3:05:59.800]  human um system and it's it's it's the final revolution jay dyer is taking over can't wait
[3:05:59.800 --> 3:06:05.320]  to hear what he covers in the next 45 minutes this is groundbreaking real stuff this is the
[3:06:05.320 --> 3:06:11.080]  trillions of times a q drop this is actual real stuff real people real globalist real proof and
[3:06:11.080 --> 3:06:17.880]  that's why they hate it so this is a reality drop our drops reality drops coming up straight ahead

[3:08:32.200 --> 3:08:38.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:08:38.680 --> 3:08:57.160]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[3:08:57.160 --> 3:09:03.480]  days all night they all day don't let nothing get in the way
[3:09:03.480 --> 3:09:09.480]  welcome back to the alex jones show on your guest list j dire no one has talked about a book that
[3:09:09.480 --> 3:09:15.800]  you've probably heard of but a lot of people haven't read it's called the communist manifesto by
[3:09:15.800 --> 3:09:22.360]  a little known figure named carl marx and his buddy fred engels and at a certain point in the book
[3:09:22.360 --> 3:09:28.600]  they lay out a 10 point plan and i want to i want you to listen and see if you think any of these
[3:09:28.600 --> 3:09:35.480]  sound kind of familiar the first plan was the abolition of private property and that all this
[3:09:35.480 --> 3:09:41.000]  private property would go into the hands of a centralized and controlling state and this would
[3:09:41.000 --> 3:09:46.440]  include land right obviously not just the possessions but your inheritance right this kind of stuff
[3:09:46.440 --> 3:09:54.360]  number two would be a heavy progressive graduated income tax i know that if you own a business
[3:09:54.360 --> 3:10:00.040]  as many of us do you know that you pay a lot of taxes right that seems to be the case so we got
[3:10:00.040 --> 3:10:04.840]  two check marks here number three abolition of all rights of inheritance as i mentioned obviously
[3:10:04.840 --> 3:10:11.320]  that goes along with point number one about private property for certification of the property of
[3:10:11.320 --> 3:10:16.520]  all immigrants and rebels all right excuse me confiscation so anybody who goes against you get
[3:10:16.520 --> 3:10:23.720]  your bank account you get your property seized is that happening maybe not property yet but
[3:10:23.720 --> 3:10:28.920]  that's on a way on this way and then by extension yes the other stuff the economic elements would
[3:10:28.920 --> 3:10:35.720]  would count as that number five centralization of all credit in the hands of a state by the means
[3:10:35.720 --> 3:10:42.200]  of a state or national bank and a capital with an exclusive monopoly monopoly on this power
[3:10:43.880 --> 3:10:48.760]  now if you know the history of you know american attempts to limit the government right this is
[3:10:48.760 --> 3:10:53.800]  the complete complete opposite of what the us and some of the you know founding fathers who
[3:10:53.800 --> 3:10:58.440]  staked their whole approach to government by trying to limit the banks right andrew jackson
[3:10:58.440 --> 3:11:04.360]  is famous for this in fighting the banks and so the marxist approach is the very opposite of that
[3:11:04.360 --> 3:11:09.240]  which is to attempt to have a completely command and control economy where people don't have the
[3:11:09.240 --> 3:11:14.600]  freedom to you know do exchange the freedom to create their own currencies like bitcoin or
[3:11:14.600 --> 3:11:19.320]  something like that all that has to be controlled and stamped out and gold for example has to be
[3:11:19.320 --> 3:11:26.920]  confiscated and so so far we're the first five we're we're we're completely there right number
[3:11:26.920 --> 3:11:31.880]  six the confiscation centralization of the means of communication and transport in the hands of
[3:11:31.880 --> 3:11:36.840]  the state now we're not there yet but it looks like what the things that are coming due to the
[3:11:36.840 --> 3:11:42.920]  kufid virus and all this stuff that's at least incrementally making its way here right where
[3:11:42.920 --> 3:11:50.520]  the control of food the the food lanes the the supply lanes this kind of stuff the logistics
[3:11:50.520 --> 3:11:55.240]  right is eventually probably going to be put underneath some kind of technocratic and it
[3:11:55.240 --> 3:12:00.600]  doesn't have to be stay remember what i'm going to kind of throw as a bit of a curveball at you is
[3:12:00.600 --> 3:12:06.440]  that you may think this is all under you know uncle sam it's not just uncle sam right it's a public
[3:12:06.440 --> 3:12:11.480]  private partnership that we're going under and that's why it's even more dangerous and it's not
[3:12:11.480 --> 3:12:19.320]  it's the model of marxism but it's marxism that's done by corporations big fortune 100 that's what
[3:12:19.320 --> 3:12:24.120]  i'm talking about here corporate communism now some people say well that's fascism but it's not
[3:12:24.120 --> 3:12:30.280]  exactly the same as fascism because this kind of implements elements of all three 20th century
[3:12:30.280 --> 3:12:38.120]  systems right capitalism democracy free market as well as the communist as well as the socialist
[3:12:38.120 --> 3:12:43.080]  and the fascist so all of these three four or five systems are going to be kind of melded into one
[3:12:43.720 --> 3:12:48.360]  worst of each basically just look at it like they're taking the worst of each of these systems
[3:12:48.360 --> 3:12:53.960]  putting it into one big ball and or one big fist and basically bopping you on the head with it
[3:12:53.960 --> 3:13:01.400]  confiscation of excuse me number seven the extension of factories and instruments of production
[3:13:01.400 --> 3:13:06.440]  owned by the state to bring in the cultivation of wastelands and the improvement of soil so
[3:13:06.440 --> 3:13:11.960]  basically the control of farmlands right this is something about soil and and agra being controlled
[3:13:11.960 --> 3:13:16.520]  by centralized power number eight and that's happening obviously if you know any farmers
[3:13:16.520 --> 3:13:20.680]  they'll tell you about this kind of stuff happening in the last several decades equal
[3:13:20.680 --> 3:13:27.160]  liability of all two labor so you don't have the right if you own a business to hire who you want
[3:13:28.040 --> 3:13:33.960]  there's this enforced workers sort of you know affirmative action type of thing right now this
[3:13:33.960 --> 3:13:39.560]  at this time when march was writing this it was all about class warfare and we're moving out of
[3:13:39.560 --> 3:13:45.400]  just class warfare into these invented kind of gender warfare and identity warfare these are just
[3:13:45.400 --> 3:13:52.440]  extensions of this kind of class warfare to other types of you know special groups so to speak
[3:13:53.320 --> 3:14:00.600]  and then it says combination of agriculture and manufacturing industries being controlled he's
[3:14:00.600 --> 3:14:07.080]  saying in a gradual abolition of the distinction between town and country now this is the early
[3:14:07.080 --> 3:14:13.400]  elements of technocracy in marx a lot of people don't know that marx was a technocrat he thought
[3:14:13.400 --> 3:14:19.160]  that eventually technology would give rise to the withering away of the need for there to be a state
[3:14:19.880 --> 3:14:25.880]  again i know that that means comes a surprise but the original marx's view was for the final stage of
[3:14:26.680 --> 3:14:31.720]  of communism when it got to its full flourish stage marx thought that you would have total freedom
[3:14:32.440 --> 3:14:37.000]  right now i don't think that he really believed that right i think that's the selling point right
[3:14:37.000 --> 3:14:43.240]  the selling point is hey if you just let us bring in this communal disto utopia now you'll get
[3:14:43.240 --> 3:14:47.080]  total freedom i promise just trust us right just let us have control of everything and
[3:14:47.080 --> 3:14:52.280]  we'll give you this this utopia and that's why the original marx's plan projected that
[3:14:53.080 --> 3:14:59.800]  stateless utopia right marx has some famous statement about when the utopia comes he hopes
[3:15:00.440 --> 3:15:04.200]  you'll just be able to wake up in the morning and and you won't have to worry about work
[3:15:04.840 --> 3:15:09.480]  you'll decide to go fishing or paint a picture whatever you want to do that day right so there
[3:15:09.480 --> 3:15:16.680]  was this original libertarian freedom element to the final stage of marxism in the original marx
[3:15:17.560 --> 3:15:22.840]  now later marx is different from that you have what's what's called frankford school marxism
[3:15:22.840 --> 3:15:27.560]  you've got soviet block marxism there's different flavors of marxism after this but the original
[3:15:27.560 --> 3:15:34.040]  plan was sold as a way to create a free quote unquote utopia now remember this free utopia
[3:15:34.040 --> 3:15:40.040]  includes no private property in the sense that do you really have a husband and a wife and kids
[3:15:41.000 --> 3:15:46.840]  no the property to say so now you can see why the marxist like the idea of wife swapping sharing
[3:15:46.840 --> 3:15:53.080]  wives and uh eyes wide shut style right parties right they like the degeneracy because it sort of
[3:15:53.080 --> 3:15:58.680]  they in their view freeze people from the taboos and strictures that are according to them social
[3:15:58.680 --> 3:16:03.000]  constructs right marriage is not a thing that god gave the moral laws not a thing that god gave
[3:16:03.000 --> 3:16:09.400]  that's all just a social construct that when you promote degeneracy you break people's binding
[3:16:09.400 --> 3:16:14.920]  taboos and identity that they find in in religion in their their tradition and so forth and now
[3:16:14.920 --> 3:16:20.840]  they're just kind of uh putty that you can mold right by the state or the centralized corporate
[3:16:20.840 --> 3:16:26.760]  state the next one that he mentioned is the uh well by the way so the reason I was talking about
[3:16:26.760 --> 3:16:32.920]  technocracy was the blending of town and country meaning that you don't have a refuge you don't
[3:16:32.920 --> 3:16:37.400]  have a way to kind of opt out and go to well I'm gonna go live you know on the mountain side like
[3:16:37.400 --> 3:16:43.720]  a hermit be germ on johnson or so no no you will not be able to leave the cities and this is the
[3:16:43.720 --> 3:16:49.480]  idea of the mega cities the smart cities right which the big tech IBM these companies these
[3:16:49.480 --> 3:16:55.480]  companies have been promoting the idea of way ahead of their time smart cities where to live there
[3:16:55.480 --> 3:17:00.280]  will require you to kind of give up a lot of freedoms perhaps you might even have to be sterilized
[3:17:00.280 --> 3:17:04.920]  eventually right oh we'll give you a ubi you can come live in you know the google bubble city but
[3:17:05.880 --> 3:17:09.080]  you got to get sterilized right this kind of stuff is what we can expand last of all
[3:17:09.640 --> 3:17:15.720]  free education promoted by the state for all and for all children that's mandatory so it's
[3:17:15.720 --> 3:17:21.720]  free but it's mandatory right and that's to brainwash everybody into the socialized system
[3:17:21.720 --> 3:17:26.040]  when we get back I'll talk about some of the founders of american education of course man john
[3:17:26.040 --> 3:17:34.280]  do we force that very thing if you get back yeah anybody listening to my voice you can simply
[3:17:34.280 --> 3:17:42.280]  search into the term devos group technocracy or technocrats you will get claus schwaab and
[3:17:42.280 --> 3:17:49.320]  john cod younger and all the new world order globalists like gg pink saying that they no longer
[3:17:49.320 --> 3:17:55.000]  want elected leaders over governments that they want businessmen technocrats over it and that's
[3:17:55.000 --> 3:17:59.640]  who claus schwaab is you might want to look into the guy that says they've watched the covet 19
[3:17:59.640 --> 3:18:04.120]  lockdowns to bankruptcy and make you poor you might want to find out who this super villain is
[3:18:04.760 --> 3:18:09.400]  but you see he believes because he's hidden playing you and you're not speaking out against it that
[3:18:09.400 --> 3:18:13.080]  he has the right to do it to you you might want to find out who he works for he works directly
[3:18:13.080 --> 3:18:18.760]  for prince charles he developed since the 80s the plan for global sustainability that means
[3:18:18.760 --> 3:18:24.600]  worldwide neo feudalism in his own works so you might want to find out how he talks about using
[3:18:24.600 --> 3:18:29.400]  vaccines to sterilize you for you take those shots you might just want to find out who this villain
[3:18:29.400 --> 3:18:37.720]  is all right this is greg reese from info wars dot com i have many reasons to be grateful for

[3:21:01.800 --> 3:21:06.120]  by the way if you're interested in uh technocracy i have two books and they have
[3:21:06.120 --> 3:21:12.280]  extensive sections and chapters on technocracy in fact i wrote a whole book on the way hollywood
[3:21:12.280 --> 3:21:17.720]  tells us ahead of time about transhumanism and what's coming in this technocratic area you can
[3:21:17.720 --> 3:21:24.280]  get signed copies of my book at jasonalsis dot com what i was just discussing was this last plank
[3:21:24.280 --> 3:21:31.640]  in the communist manifesto which is about free enforced state education for all and that's what
[3:21:31.640 --> 3:21:36.200]  we've seen common core right this kind of stuff going all the way back to the founders of american
[3:21:36.200 --> 3:21:42.920]  public education john dewey hoarse man who were themselves socialists who believe in the socializing
[3:21:42.920 --> 3:21:47.400]  of individuals not in the educating of individuals they literally wrote about that there's
[3:21:47.400 --> 3:21:53.240]  entire books written by these people about the utopian ideals of creating a socialized
[3:21:53.240 --> 3:21:59.400]  education system that would condition people through operant pavlovian conditioning into
[3:21:59.400 --> 3:22:05.080]  becoming wards of a centralized authority now most of us still unfortunately i'm not trying
[3:22:05.080 --> 3:22:10.840]  to call anybody in particular just in the political sphere in the west we still get trapped into
[3:22:10.840 --> 3:22:16.680]  thinking that libertarianism is the good guys because they're against the state and the state
[3:22:16.680 --> 3:22:22.840]  is the bad guys and you know they're trying to enforce this control system and the corporation's
[3:22:22.840 --> 3:22:27.080]  therefore good state therefore bad and what i'm trying to tell you is that it's worse than that
[3:22:27.080 --> 3:22:31.160]  unfortunately right that might have been the case at one point in time maybe a hundred hundred
[3:22:31.160 --> 3:22:37.800]  fifty years ago now we're in a situation where the banks the state the fortune 100 are the same
[3:22:37.800 --> 3:22:42.840]  entity right and if you read quickly he calls this monopoly capitalism and he says monopoly
[3:22:42.840 --> 3:22:49.080]  capitalism rose out of the big cartels and the big banking families of finance capitalism to take
[3:22:49.080 --> 3:22:55.320]  over basically large portions of not just the western economies but the global economy and
[3:22:55.320 --> 3:22:59.720]  global market now they don't run everything but they have the upper hand when it comes to the
[3:22:59.720 --> 3:23:06.680]  world and if you doubt that just look at the last five years and the policies that the fortune 100
[3:23:06.680 --> 3:23:13.480]  have imposed across the world why does almost every country muzzle everyone why does almost every
[3:23:13.480 --> 3:23:19.880]  country suddenly going to you know enact these mandates about what you have to do to travel
[3:23:19.880 --> 3:23:25.960]  well that's because there's already a corporate global government that's been stealthily stealthily
[3:23:25.960 --> 3:23:32.040]  put in place for the last several decades now Alex was asking about well what is this this
[3:23:32.040 --> 3:23:37.880]  austerity plan what is this all about you go back to well a hundred years ago you can go back to the
[3:23:37.880 --> 3:23:42.600]  technocrats you can go back to Bertrand Russell you can go back to hg wells who wrote book after
[3:23:42.600 --> 3:23:48.200]  book after book after book saying this is what we're going to do in the next century right and
[3:23:48.200 --> 3:23:53.960]  who wrote the unesco plan right julian huxley's aldous huxley's brother julian huxley he wrote
[3:23:53.960 --> 3:23:59.640]  the unesco philosophy and plan were inculcating through education that tenth plank of the communist
[3:23:59.640 --> 3:24:06.520]  manifesto right the global mindset for the whole world in every country right so that unesco promotes
[3:24:06.520 --> 3:24:13.160]  all of these same ideas across the world united nations is kind of like a a nascent sort of neo
[3:24:13.800 --> 3:24:19.880]  initial form of what they want to eventually give birth to right and it's it's wrong to think of it
[3:24:19.880 --> 3:24:25.320]  like well the fortune 100 are fighting against the un and it's like corporate versus you know
[3:24:25.320 --> 3:24:31.160]  collectivist that's only one level right at the highest level the technocrats just like in
[3:24:31.160 --> 3:24:36.040]  huxley's brave new world they don't really care about the ideology they don't really care about
[3:24:36.040 --> 3:24:42.120]  whether you believe capitalism and they believe communism or not or fascism or so so they're
[3:24:42.120 --> 3:24:47.560]  kind of above the ideologies and it's a will to power right if you understand niches you understand
[3:24:47.560 --> 3:24:53.000]  the will to power that ideologies are just a way to kind of trick people right and move
[3:24:53.000 --> 3:24:57.400]  the chess pieces around on the table now i'm not saying that there's no true ideology i'm just saying
[3:24:57.400 --> 3:25:03.880]  that's the power elite's perspective of ideologies of national governments of this kind of stuff
[3:25:03.880 --> 3:25:08.920]  they see it as just a tool on the chessboard hence bruisinski's grand chessboard analogy
[3:25:09.560 --> 3:25:15.800]  so but it is key it's crucial to understand communism because communism is technocratic
[3:25:15.800 --> 3:25:21.320]  right its origins are technocratic if you go back to the french revolution where communism comes from
[3:25:21.320 --> 3:25:27.480]  you get these these characters who were known as jacobins right if you read about the jacobins
[3:25:27.480 --> 3:25:32.760]  there's a good book on this called perfectabilis which is the just the history of the above variant
[3:25:32.760 --> 3:25:38.760]  illuminati you know that they were the original technocrats right if it's the case that family
[3:25:39.320 --> 3:25:44.840]  and marriage and church and state are just social constructs we just sort of make them up right
[3:25:44.840 --> 3:25:50.280]  because there is no god it's atheistic right there's no god that's just all made up then we can make
[3:25:50.280 --> 3:25:56.280]  up anything right we can make up a new system we can share our wives we can share our goods right
[3:25:56.280 --> 3:26:04.200]  and so at the lower level right there's the jacobin magazine praising our new saint our new hero joe
[3:26:05.480 --> 3:26:12.680]  saint joe there uh if if if we can just institute a new system right then man can
[3:26:13.240 --> 3:26:17.960]  can step into that role of being the high priest right this the technocrat the scientist is the
[3:26:17.960 --> 3:26:24.120]  new man in the priestly vestment right the lab coat is the new priestly vestment and that's really
[3:26:24.120 --> 3:26:29.560]  the attitude of the the luciferians were a postmodern nihilistic satanists who i think are at
[3:26:29.560 --> 3:26:35.240]  the highest level of the system right they see this as a system to be brought into in their
[3:26:35.240 --> 3:26:41.560]  mindset help them transcend the limitations of humanity if you watch 2001 a space Odyssey
[3:26:41.560 --> 3:26:50.360]  that's really what arthur c clark and um uh i just went blank arthur c clark and
[3:26:52.520 --> 3:26:57.240]  you know the guy who did all the best movies right 2001 a space Odyssey you did that i just went
[3:26:57.240 --> 3:27:04.120]  blank you know how me right uh so 2001 all these films right they're telling us about the same
[3:27:04.120 --> 3:27:08.360]  thing that clark who by the way arthur c clark sandley cubrick i don't know why i'm blank as
[3:27:08.360 --> 3:27:13.640]  cubrick was in the circles of these people right and arthur c clark himself was hanging out with
[3:27:13.640 --> 3:27:18.760]  croly another person who said we have to storm heaven and kind of initiate this new aeon of
[3:27:18.760 --> 3:27:25.240]  a porous right which is a sort of antichrist era um clark wrote another book that people forget
[3:27:25.240 --> 3:27:32.360]  about called childhoods in right and in childhoods in he has the you know alien deception essentially
[3:27:32.360 --> 3:27:38.840]  coming into fruition through what are demons right when karellen the quote alien in the ship
[3:27:38.840 --> 3:27:45.080]  emerges to the masses he literally looks like a picturesque archetypal demon right if you watch
[3:27:45.080 --> 3:27:50.840]  the i think the sci-fi channel did a version of um childhoods in a couple years ago you notice
[3:27:50.840 --> 3:27:56.760]  that karellen you know literally looks like you know tim curry in legend right playing the devil
[3:27:56.760 --> 3:28:01.960]  right and that was a pretty good series actually the the way they did it you know they had karellen
[3:28:01.960 --> 3:28:08.280]  basically duping everyone and for a while giving people a temporary dystopia right people for a
[3:28:08.280 --> 3:28:14.040]  while have the healing of their illnesses right they're given life extension technology they're
[3:28:14.040 --> 3:28:18.680]  given all of these different things and what do the elite want well they they steal everybody's
[3:28:18.680 --> 3:28:24.360]  children right they basically say that we're going to take your kids we're going to evolve them
[3:28:24.360 --> 3:28:28.280]  right through mk ultra and bring you know mind control type stuff and we're going to have to
[3:28:28.280 --> 3:28:33.320]  depopulate everyone else right because you're just too primitive you haven't evolved enough you haven't
[3:28:33.320 --> 3:28:37.880]  you know you're not fit to be a space brother to all the other space brother there he is with his
[3:28:37.880 --> 3:28:42.680]  cloven hoof right walking out i wonder what that all this is just an alien right no it's not a
[3:28:42.680 --> 3:28:49.640]  it's not an alien it's a demon right and again the very guy who did 2001 right which is all about
[3:28:49.640 --> 3:28:54.600]  transhumanism and nuking the planet that's the original screenplay is that star child has to
[3:28:54.600 --> 3:29:03.240]  depopulate by wiping everything clean slate great reset star child right this big floating space baby
[3:29:03.960 --> 3:29:08.520]  right his man when man becomes god and then he said okay i gotta i gotta wipe out this universe
[3:29:08.520 --> 3:29:12.920]  do a great reset on the whole universe right so if you want to understand he doesn't want to space
[3:29:12.920 --> 3:29:19.560]  out to see it's cosmic a great reset right same idea in clark right who was an illuminous clark
[3:29:19.560 --> 3:29:26.440]  is part of this crowd of illuminous hanging out with all the same people prolly all the elite
[3:29:26.440 --> 3:29:32.120]  basically saying that the technocratic government is here to do a malthusian depopulation operation
[3:29:32.120 --> 3:29:37.400]  that's what that looks about that's what 2001 is actually about if you go back and watch it now
[3:29:37.400 --> 3:29:43.000]  why do they have that ideology where does that come from right that comes from mouth this and from
[3:29:43.000 --> 3:29:49.320]  the royal society elites who foisted this darwinian mythos on everybody that because they are the
[3:29:49.320 --> 3:29:55.000]  most evolved they have the right the mandate of nature to kill everybody else off right
[3:29:55.000 --> 3:30:00.280]  charles golf and darwin wrote a book called the next million years and in that book he says that
[3:30:00.280 --> 3:30:08.040]  we have the divine mandate through our blue blood through our elite bloodline right it's our duty
[3:30:08.680 --> 3:30:14.520]  to kill and and depopulate on a mass scale the georgia guide stones are an erected monument
[3:30:14.520 --> 3:30:19.640]  publicly telling everybody this right so if you doubt this go look up the georgia guide stones
[3:30:19.640 --> 3:30:24.440]  go look up the book the next million years all right well they say what they're going to do ahead

[3:34:43.160 --> 3:34:49.240]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:34:54.200 --> 3:34:58.920]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm your guest host daydark now i have to apologize
[3:34:58.920 --> 3:35:04.200]  for getting to the coup game a minute ago i had snorted a whole line of pumpkin pop some earlier
[3:35:04.200 --> 3:35:09.560]  so i was out of my mind uh just kind of that stuff's even stronger than super male vitality
[3:35:09.560 --> 3:35:14.360]  i can tell you right now now i was talking about uh the next million years right by trolls galtin
[3:35:14.360 --> 3:35:22.600]  darwin in that galtin eugenics based darwin huxley family right role society crew and he wrote this
[3:35:22.600 --> 3:35:27.640]  book that a lot of people don't know about outlining what the elite wanted to do not just in the next
[3:35:27.640 --> 3:35:34.120]  20 50 100 years but kind of a uh extreme prediction here you saw he wants to talk about what happens
[3:35:34.120 --> 3:35:39.560]  the next billion years which in itself is kind of preposterous but it does lay out right what
[3:35:39.560 --> 3:35:47.000]  their long-term plan is and in chapter eight he says that that we have to go for mass birth control
[3:35:47.000 --> 3:35:53.160]  mass depopulation mass reduction in the population through what he calls eugenic regimentation
[3:35:53.160 --> 3:36:01.880]  and he says that we will promote a lot of uh industrialization believe it or not he says
[3:36:01.880 --> 3:36:08.600]  because when we industrialize a country right when they get fat dumb and happy the birth rate goes
[3:36:08.600 --> 3:36:15.000]  down and he says that will be one of the key ways to do that and by doing that will will industrialize
[3:36:15.000 --> 3:36:22.200]  the world will raise everybody's living standards and then he says we we will have a infrastructure
[3:36:22.200 --> 3:36:30.200]  for that technocratic society but he says remember that prosperity is key to infanticide yes
[3:36:30.200 --> 3:36:36.200]  prosperity is key to infanticide and to depopulation operations and he even goes so far as to say that
[3:36:37.720 --> 3:36:43.080]  movements of masses of people are a weapon right you ever heard of this weapons of mass
[3:36:43.080 --> 3:36:49.000]  migration right kelly greenhill and he says that when you eventually get a certain level of prosperity
[3:36:49.000 --> 3:36:55.560]  in a country the birth rates go negative right now uh he wrote this back in 1952 but he's just
[3:36:55.560 --> 3:37:02.520]  repeating the old line of thomas malthus right um a long time ago before him right the the anglican
[3:37:02.520 --> 3:37:07.160]  minister so-called preacher talk about you know luciferians and minister preacher garb
[3:37:08.440 --> 3:37:13.560]  he says that in order to bring all of this in right he ends this uh this next chapter
[3:37:13.560 --> 3:37:21.800]  by talking about creating a fake religion that everybody would be duped by that's based around
[3:37:21.800 --> 3:37:27.960]  scientism right science he says will be the new religion and the elite will run this religion
[3:37:27.960 --> 3:37:34.360]  from the background right and then it's really just a cloak for Darwinism he says and he says
[3:37:34.360 --> 3:37:40.520]  it will take this so far literally he ends the chapter he says that that they will offer up their
[3:37:40.520 --> 3:37:49.080]  children to us for the benefit of the human race now literally saying that you will give your
[3:37:49.080 --> 3:37:53.960]  children up to the new world order right to the global government whether that means sacrifice
[3:37:53.960 --> 3:37:58.440]  depopulation or give them over to the state so that they can be brainwashed to become you know
[3:37:59.080 --> 3:38:06.840]  karelin's little um karelin's tots right the little tots that serve satan or whatever i mean
[3:38:06.840 --> 3:38:11.320]  that's literally what they're talking about here right again i'm going to give you another example
[3:38:11.320 --> 3:38:16.200]  of this crazy stuff there was a little known book now i covered this with richard grove the other
[3:38:16.200 --> 3:38:22.600]  day we had a excellent uh two hour talk that went viral got a hundred hundred and ten twenty
[3:38:22.600 --> 3:38:27.960]  thousand views on that talk you can go watch it at my youtube channel where we went into the great
[3:38:27.960 --> 3:38:32.120]  reset and i brought up this book and everybody's kind of blown away they they couldn't believe
[3:38:32.120 --> 3:38:38.840]  that this book existed back in 1982 i think it was written in 82 and it's a collection of a bunch
[3:38:38.840 --> 3:38:44.680]  of progressives and futurists and transhumanists writing about all these different areas of life
[3:38:44.680 --> 3:38:51.560]  so it includes people like carl rogers jonah salk tim leary uh willis harman right of changing
[3:38:51.560 --> 3:38:57.240]  images of man fame it includes uh people like barbara marx hubbard of all people maryland
[3:38:57.240 --> 3:39:04.840]  furgusson who wrote the uh oh what's her her new agey book uh about the aquarium era right
[3:39:05.640 --> 3:39:10.760]  so what's amazing about this is that willis harman the guy who was involved in changing
[3:39:10.760 --> 3:39:14.920]  images of man one of the most important white papers for the elite if you haven't read that
[3:39:14.920 --> 3:39:21.320]  definitely go read that look at that he wrote a book about what work would be like in the technocratic
[3:39:21.320 --> 3:39:28.440]  future right right here work willis harman changing images of man technocrats socialist right type of
[3:39:28.440 --> 3:39:34.440]  guy and he says that uh we're gonna have to figure out what to do number one with the extra people
[3:39:35.080 --> 3:39:40.360]  right that's a phrase that the british elite you know that the extra people so the the essential
[3:39:40.360 --> 3:39:45.480]  people and the extra people so now you're starting to see that the essential workers the essential
[3:39:45.480 --> 3:39:51.320]  twerkers if you're a a nurse in a hospital apparently the essential workers are distinguished
[3:39:51.320 --> 3:39:57.880]  from the non-essential and willis harman wrote this back in 1982 and he said that when we bring this in
[3:39:59.080 --> 3:40:04.520]  part of determining what would be the ubi your universal basic income that's doled out to you
[3:40:04.520 --> 3:40:11.560]  being on the the globalist dole right get your ebt card uh what would determine you being on ubi
[3:40:11.560 --> 3:40:19.800]  would be your essential work right whether you're essential or not now again he said this in 1982
[3:40:21.640 --> 3:40:27.560]  so back in 1982 he said that we would need eventually some kind of austerity to be brought in
[3:40:28.200 --> 3:40:31.800]  great reset most people he says will work from home
[3:40:33.640 --> 3:40:38.760]  he says will even promote tiny houses you see all these goofballs on youtube like the millennials
[3:40:38.760 --> 3:40:43.800]  and zoomers who want to live in a van and drive around and maybe when you're 20 that's fun but
[3:40:43.800 --> 3:40:49.000]  when you're 50 you don't want to be living in a van i promise you right like the gerry garcia van
[3:40:49.000 --> 3:40:54.760]  living thing is not for when you're 50 right uh you you want a recliner when you're 50 okay
[3:40:55.400 --> 3:41:00.920]  yeah you want to chill you don't want to live in a van but tiny living is literally part of this
[3:41:00.920 --> 3:41:05.640]  great reset stuff right if you don't know that all of this goes into uh there was a there was a
[3:41:05.640 --> 3:41:10.600]  youtuber a couple months ago or maybe his last year that was suddenly she got like 50 million
[3:41:10.600 --> 3:41:14.120]  views on her first video and it was just this girl who was going to live in a van right and
[3:41:14.120 --> 3:41:19.640]  ride around the country living in a van that's just so that you don't have any say so in the
[3:41:19.640 --> 3:41:24.680]  future right what's bill gates doing oh he's buying up all the land right he's going to own the land
[3:41:24.680 --> 3:41:30.840]  you're going to live in a van down by the river right like chris farley right literally the chris
[3:41:30.840 --> 3:41:37.560]  farley aspect of the great reset and he even says that the middle ages were interesting because it
[3:41:37.560 --> 3:41:44.680]  was this feudal model right the feudal model of the middle ages and since the role of work has
[3:41:44.680 --> 3:41:49.800]  changed from the middle ages to the to the modern technocratic future that we're going into all we
[3:41:49.800 --> 3:41:57.240]  have to do is give people various forms of escapism in their time off right to where they go and go
[3:41:57.240 --> 3:42:02.040]  live in a virtual world and they're having sex with dragons and their virtual you know rift world
[3:42:02.040 --> 3:42:06.120]  or what an oculus world he says then we don't do you have to worry about them their meat they have
[3:42:06.120 --> 3:42:11.320]  checked out right they're not a challenge they're not a threat most of these goofuses will be in
[3:42:11.320 --> 3:42:18.520]  the virtual world having all the nastiest sex you could imagine we will then let them just die off
[3:42:18.520 --> 3:42:23.800]  or become sterilized right through uh you have to get the sterilization to get the ubi or whatever
[3:42:23.800 --> 3:42:29.160]  and he says that that will be the future that that will be the way that we can get them out of
[3:42:29.160 --> 3:42:35.160]  participating in the future they will be spectators right for the real world and for the future which
[3:42:35.160 --> 3:42:40.840]  we will own and so that's what you have to understand is that the technocratic plan is a plan to
[3:42:40.840 --> 3:42:48.520]  basically phase you out that's the essence of it the ubi is a trap right i saw there were a lot of
[3:42:48.520 --> 3:42:53.880]  last year a lot of right wingers right just a bunch of idiots the same goofuses who would go along
[3:42:53.880 --> 3:42:59.000]  with this cue crap right thinking that the oh the great reset this is this is this idea of a
[3:42:59.000 --> 3:43:03.400]  universal basic income that's good right if we just had we wouldn't have to be you know trying to
[3:43:03.400 --> 3:43:07.080]  start our own business and do all this kind of stuff that we could just get a government check
[3:43:07.800 --> 3:43:14.600]  it's the same trap that the elite used right lbj when he said that we'll just put all of the black
[3:43:14.600 --> 3:43:21.080]  community on the dole and we'll control them for the next hundred years now they're going to put
[3:43:21.080 --> 3:43:24.520]  everybody on the the dole and control you for the next hundred years
[3:43:28.600 --> 3:43:34.760]  they don't want you to be an enterprising business starting individual right so that's why
[3:43:35.320 --> 3:43:41.640]  libertarianism western christianity orthodox christianity the western ethos common law
[3:43:41.640 --> 3:43:49.240]  all limitations to centralized power limitations to centralized economics right that's the problem
[3:43:49.240 --> 3:43:54.840]  now that has to go all that has to go right limitations to international banking limitations
[3:43:54.840 --> 3:44:00.680]  to international corporations all that's got to go so that they can bring in this weird goofy system
[3:44:00.680 --> 3:44:06.440]  and by the way tim leary has a chapter in this where he says that the heroes and saints of the
[3:44:06.440 --> 3:44:12.440]  future are the scientists and he says that some of those saints include now he says it's in a
[3:44:12.440 --> 3:44:19.240]  different book but he says some of those saints include people like allister crowley why is the
[3:44:19.240 --> 3:44:27.400]  guy who's in in charge of basically getting everybody to do lsd and to do drugs right through
[3:44:27.400 --> 3:44:34.680]  his buddy john lily here the guy with the dolphin fetish why is he saying that allister crowley
[3:44:34.680 --> 3:44:42.440]  is one of the heroes and saints of the new aeon you see right storm heaven so the jacobin model
[3:44:42.440 --> 3:44:47.000]  of stormy heaven is the same as the cologne model of stormy heaven is the same as the luciferian
[3:44:47.000 --> 3:44:52.440]  model of stormy heaven it's the same plan it's the same model it's the same idea once you understand
[3:44:52.440 --> 3:44:58.760]  that it's not about capitalism versus communism this is the real plan the technocratic plan right
[3:44:58.760 --> 3:45:03.640]  the same as the jacobin plan right corporate communism then you understand the whole thing
[3:45:03.640 --> 3:45:09.880]  now you can understand why the os s put malin power did you know that mal was a yali yale in
[3:45:09.880 --> 3:45:33.800]  china skull and bones there you go state our knowledge of the yali don't show you
