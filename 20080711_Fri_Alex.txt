[00:00.000 --> 00:07.680]  government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:07.680 --> 00:13.120]  radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:13.120 --> 00:30.480]  Coming up, later in the broadcast, we have the founder of the Rainbow Gathering that got
[00:30.480 --> 00:36.480]  attacked by militarized police. Children, of course, were attacked. This was in the local
[00:36.480 --> 00:44.720]  mainstream paper that also witnessed all of this. Any pretext, any excuse to attack the enemy.
[00:45.440 --> 00:51.920]  You see, we have a military paramilitary police in this country now, and military attacks enemies
[00:51.920 --> 00:56.960]  and breaks things, kill people and break things. And they have been taught that we are the enemy.
[00:56.960 --> 01:04.640]  We are enemies of the corporate Borg state. We must be minded. We must be bossed. We must be
[01:04.640 --> 01:11.520]  basically bossed around, squeezed. Our children are to be harvested for adoption and to be used
[01:11.520 --> 01:18.480]  by pedophiles. And in some cases, just shipped out of the country for slave labor. We are here
[01:18.480 --> 01:27.920]  as a resource like a stand of timber or like a field of corn to be cut down and then made into
[01:27.920 --> 01:33.440]  products. And of course, the police themselves, the military themselves, no one is worse treated
[01:33.440 --> 01:40.960]  than them. They are called animals, scum, trash by their owners. They are experimented on. They
[01:40.960 --> 01:46.400]  are treated worse than anyone else in the system. And that's the way it's always been because the
[01:46.400 --> 01:53.760]  globalists hate and despise their enforcers more than anyone. And so pull all sorts of vicious
[01:53.760 --> 01:59.680]  dirty tricks on them. And they have them in a little mind control group culture, gang culture,
[01:59.680 --> 02:04.640]  where they're the elite and they're the good guys and they got to stick together and they got to
[02:04.640 --> 02:12.640]  cut corners to keep the state together. Meanwhile, the state absolutely hates their guts and enjoys
[02:12.640 --> 02:19.520]  crushing them one by one because the state is open criminals, conscious criminals, not mind
[02:19.520 --> 02:26.880]  control slave criminals. And so they despise the police because occasionally the way the system set
[02:26.880 --> 02:34.320]  up, the police system does actually burn real crooks in the system and the higher up crooks
[02:34.320 --> 02:40.960]  use the police power to burn their enemies. And so there is a hatred by the system itself
[02:40.960 --> 02:48.480]  of their enforcers. So that's why police and military are burned and fed on and treated
[02:48.480 --> 02:54.160]  like absolute trash along with most other government workers, i.e. the poison dust,
[02:54.160 --> 03:00.000]  depleted uranium, chemical biological testing, radiological testing. You are the ample of the
[03:00.000 --> 03:09.680]  New World odor's eye. They enjoy hurting you. They enjoy abusing you. It's a big fun joke to them.
[03:11.040 --> 03:17.360]  We have a really important show lined up for you today. We have Mark Kornke lined up, but I'm
[03:17.360 --> 03:21.280]  unable, it was hard getting him set up on the show because he's been so busy lately with projects.
[03:21.280 --> 03:26.080]  And then we were trying to double check scheduling and double confirm and I've been unable to, but
[03:26.080 --> 03:32.000]  he's scheduled, as they say, to be dropping in. Always enjoy a good talk with Mark Kornke.
[03:32.880 --> 03:43.280]  Oil sets new record above $147 a barrel. Crew jumps above $147. His concerns persist
[03:43.280 --> 03:52.720]  about Middle East conflict. Last time I checked, gold was at $164 an ounce and going up and down
[03:52.720 --> 03:59.360]  a couple dollars in the range. In fact, I want to know right now what it is. I am on Google. I will
[03:59.360 --> 04:05.600]  type in the word gold and then that will give me a selection of gold indexes so I can look at
[04:06.640 --> 04:11.040]  several of them because sometimes they're a little bit off. They're a little bit different
[04:11.040 --> 04:20.320]  and I will be able to tell you what gold is here in just a moment. Gold hit a high of
[04:21.520 --> 04:29.520]  963 about an hour ago. It is now 957 and central banks dump gold and try to drive it down,
[04:29.520 --> 04:37.280]  but it is up in the last week more than, I don't know, what's 57 and 20 something?
[04:37.280 --> 04:47.840]  It is up more than $70, right now $70 plus and that's almost $80. So we'll continue to track
[04:47.840 --> 04:55.440]  that state with us. Vital news straight ahead. Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most
[04:55.440 --> 05:00.800]  downloaded film in internet history comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut,
[05:00.800 --> 05:06.320]  an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever. Loose

[05:10.880 --> 05:15.840]  members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime
[05:15.840 --> 05:21.600]  are brought to justice. Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose. From hijackers being
[05:21.600 --> 05:26.160]  trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one

[05:53.920 --> 05:59.440]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages already
[05:59.440 --> 06:03.920]  destroying millions of American families. Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive
[06:03.920 --> 06:09.520]  than it was about a year ago. Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide.

[06:50.080 --> 06:58.640]  Life has changed. We're not 21 anymore. We have responsibilities.
[07:00.000 --> 07:04.640]  That's why there's Drink and Made Hangover Defense. Sure, we've done our share of partying.
[07:04.640 --> 07:10.480]  Yeah, dude. Now kicking back with the neighbors and a few beers is more our style. But let's face it,
[07:10.480 --> 07:15.040]  as we get older, even that can leave us feeling run down the next morning.
[07:15.040 --> 07:20.400]  With Drink and Made, you can have a few drinks tonight without waking up feeling like you had a
[07:20.400 --> 07:26.080]  few. Drink and Made's patented and proven formula of guava leaf extract has antioxidants and other
[07:26.080 --> 07:31.440]  unique properties that help prevent the headache, queasy stomach, and dehydration even a few drinks
[07:31.440 --> 07:37.120]  can leave behind. Just dissolve one Drink and Made in water and take it before bed. It's that easy.
[07:37.840 --> 07:44.080]  The next morning, bring on the responsibilities. Drink and Made Hangover Defense is available
[07:44.080 --> 07:50.240]  at retailers nationwide. Pick up some today. Remember your Drink and Made and wake up feeling great.
[07:57.120 --> 08:04.400]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[08:04.400 --> 08:13.360]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[08:19.200 --> 08:23.040]  Let me just run through the top of the stack in the news I have here.
[08:23.600 --> 08:31.760]  Oil sets a new record, about $147 a barrel. OPEC says prepare for it to rise even more, $200
[08:31.760 --> 08:38.400]  a barrel in the site. Stocks decline as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fall sharply.
[08:39.120 --> 08:45.600]  The federal government says they cannot be allowed to collapse. This is called Great Depression.
[08:45.600 --> 08:50.400]  This is called Hold Your Breath, ladies and gentlemen. This is going over the edge of the
[08:50.400 --> 08:58.000]  cliff right now. Fannie, Freddie are too big to fall lawmakers say. You know, I kept warning
[08:58.000 --> 09:03.040]  everybody for the last really six, seven years about currency devaluation intensely.
[09:03.040 --> 09:06.960]  On a daily basis, having guessed on on a weekly basis, now a daily basis,
[09:07.840 --> 09:15.040]  saying they're devaluing the dollar and ne'er do wells all over the country, make YouTube videos
[09:15.040 --> 09:20.000]  and send me threatening emails and comment on the dig stories and in our message board,
[09:20.560 --> 09:25.280]  saying we're lying, we're making it up. And they are still saying that.
[09:25.280 --> 09:33.360]  And as things deteriorate even worse, they will then come out and say, okay, the dollar's been
[09:33.360 --> 09:39.120]  devalued, but we've got to support the Federal Reserve in saving us from it. There are saviors
[09:39.120 --> 09:45.440]  when they're the ones that did it. It is this wanton desire to be ignorant, to be gamed,
[09:45.440 --> 09:50.880]  to be conned, to be lied to, to lose, to fail, to let the country fall.
[09:50.880 --> 10:02.640]  U.S. Ways Takeover of Two Mortgage Giants. Fannie and Freddie May. This is just incredible.
[10:02.640 --> 10:09.040]  Those have been giant money laundering narcotics, trafficking, uh, sieves for decades.
[10:11.360 --> 10:15.200]  Don't worry, all the big boys money safe and real assets and offshore.
[10:15.200 --> 10:21.520]  While they increase the TV ads telling you to invest your money in other speculative systems,
[10:21.520 --> 10:28.160]  they used to then leverage. Gold hits four month high on oil and dollar. Gold rallied more than
[10:28.160 --> 10:34.160]  two percent to a four month high. Today is the dollar slumped against the euro further. Oil
[10:34.160 --> 10:41.520]  soared to a record high and equity markets floundered on renewed fears over the scope of
[10:41.520 --> 10:50.800]  the credit crisis. Our entire economic future is on the rocks. When a ship runs the ground,
[10:50.800 --> 10:58.960]  it then begins breaking up. The country is breaking up now. Now, when we were a, uh, industrial nation
[10:58.960 --> 11:06.160]  that was still agrarian, when we still had large industrial capacity in a country of skilled craftsmen
[11:06.160 --> 11:12.560]  and tradesmen who would have the knowledge passed on and who had advanced the knowledge over thousands
[11:12.560 --> 11:18.560]  of years, we had a great brain trust in this country from all over the world, from Europe,
[11:18.560 --> 11:24.000]  from the Middle East, from Asia, from Africa. All those tradesmen had integrated, had shared the
[11:24.000 --> 11:30.240]  knowledge. We were the best in the world. We are now way behind all the industrialized nations,
[11:30.240 --> 11:34.960]  not just for education, but for our trades, craftsmanship. And now we don't even have the base
[11:34.960 --> 11:42.080]  knowledge to, to start our economy over. The globalists centralized our wealth, transferred our
[11:42.080 --> 11:48.560]  factories, the engine of wealth overseas, told us globalism was mother's milk, and now they are
[11:48.560 --> 11:58.560]  removing, uh, the final pens which undergirded this society. And they are going to propose
[11:58.560 --> 12:08.000]  carbon credits to the citizenry. They are ramming them through in England, Canada, and cities in the
[12:08.000 --> 12:14.320]  U.S. Stores are now putting signs up. We got photos of this yesterday. We'll talk about it later.
[12:14.320 --> 12:18.880]  That says if you've got a low emissions car, you get to park at the front. See,
[12:18.880 --> 12:23.600]  you're going to be second class citizens. Uh, if you don't, uh, in, in, in California,
[12:23.600 --> 12:30.480]  you'll have on the side of your new car, a big sticker by law of what the emissions of that car
[12:30.480 --> 12:38.480]  are. Codifying the fraudulent science that greenhouse gases are causing global warming,
[12:38.480 --> 12:45.360]  everyone will wear their new equivalent to yellow stars on themselves. Uh, the new social
[12:45.360 --> 12:52.160]  engineering 10 million Maoist, and that's what he admits he's modeling. And after Al Gore with big
[12:52.160 --> 13:00.080]  IMF and World Bank and Chase Manhattan City Bank, J.P. Morgan chase funding, uh, to the program in
[13:00.080 --> 13:06.960]  the schools, uh, all over Austin, they knife the tires of SUVs. They bash the windows out.
[13:06.960 --> 13:12.800]  It's never on the news, but every time I pull into a major park and now, uh, go down to Zilker,
[13:12.800 --> 13:20.000]  there's bash out windows and, and lanced tires as the new army is the new, as the new Maoist
[13:20.000 --> 13:25.840]  waving their red books for the bankers to bring in the new feudalism, viciously go out, knifing
[13:25.840 --> 13:32.960]  the tires thinking they're involved in a revolution when they're really bringing in the system of
[13:32.960 --> 13:42.320]  total neo feudalism and control. Gold hits four month high on oil dollar plunge, oil exploding
[13:42.320 --> 13:50.480]  dollar plunging. And in military news, there are scores of media reports in the foreign press,
[13:50.480 --> 13:59.280]  French news agency, BBC, London telegraph, press TV, all reporting what the White House has announced
[14:00.000 --> 14:07.040]  that they have intensified with an additional $400 million in funding for known al-Qaeda groups,
[14:07.040 --> 14:14.480]  true Sunni, Wahhabist sex commanded by the number three in al-Qaeda to attack Iran and intensify
[14:14.480 --> 14:20.400]  attacks on them. Now Iran is laying there taking this while they move to put up blockades and
[14:20.400 --> 14:28.400]  total sanctions of the nation as more of their assets are seized. Iran has no nuclear program,
[14:28.400 --> 14:33.360]  no offensive weapon program. This is in all the government's reports. They can't even get their
[14:33.360 --> 14:39.840]  own true analysts to disgrace themselves and ruin their careers. It's not just that they
[14:39.840 --> 14:43.840]  are good guys, most of them aren't. They're pragmatists. They know it'll destroy
[14:43.840 --> 14:48.240]  their name forever. They could be indicted for it. So they have the office of special plans,
[14:48.240 --> 14:56.560]  basically a massage operation. That's who runs it all known, dual agent public Israelis saying,
[14:56.560 --> 15:00.560]  and there's some British intel in there as well. I mean, we've got whole special forces groups
[15:00.560 --> 15:07.120]  commanded by British colonels now. So, I mean, it's just a total handover of our society to
[15:07.120 --> 15:16.160]  foreigners and mercenaries. And they've got little kangaroo offices in the Pentagon putting out the
[15:16.160 --> 15:21.040]  same disinfo, same folks who told you about yellow cake uranium from Niger and aluminum tubes and
[15:21.040 --> 15:27.440]  nukes and jumbo jets that the Iraqis were training in to carry out 9-11 all made up.
[15:27.440 --> 15:34.480]  They would show you hot air, 18 wheeler trucks that were for pumping up with hydrogen,
[15:36.240 --> 15:47.440]  the balloons that the British and US sold Saddam for artillery direction during World War II
[15:47.440 --> 15:54.480]  technology, totally peaceful hydrogen balloons, the trucks that command and control them and
[15:54.480 --> 15:59.360]  pump the hydrogen into them. They knew day one and they told you they were anthrax machines.
[15:59.360 --> 16:06.080]  I mean, it just, they talked to you like low-grade morons laughing at you all the way to the bank.
[16:07.440 --> 16:14.400]  And now this, ladies and gentlemen, Jerusalem post Israeli war planes practice in Iraq.
[16:15.200 --> 16:20.800]  And this is the Israeli government says and has confirmed that they have Israeli aircraft
[16:20.800 --> 16:29.920]  F-15s, F-16s and their variant aircraft, the Eagle, all stacked up by the hundreds waiting in
[16:29.920 --> 16:36.880]  Iraq right across the border from Iran, preparing to attack them. The head of the war department of
[16:36.880 --> 16:48.480]  Israel Barak is over here right now peddling war. He is in DC meeting with the president,
[16:48.480 --> 16:54.160]  no doubt showing in pictures of the president with gay porn stars that visited the White House
[16:54.160 --> 17:00.320]  hundreds of times a piece, like Jeff Gannon. I tell people about this and they've forgotten
[17:00.320 --> 17:05.200]  and they go, oh, I remember. Yeah. And Bush was seeing kissing him at press conferences.
[17:05.200 --> 17:10.160]  That's right. He's so out of his mind, he can't even keep his hands off of him in public.
[17:11.040 --> 17:16.880]  I mean, we'll start seeing governors and people just hug and kiss each other in public. And we
[17:16.880 --> 17:23.280]  all know what most of the governors are. I mean, I'm not even attacking gay people. My point is,
[17:23.280 --> 17:32.560]  is that this is a guild in government, mainly Republicans. The Democrats, it keeps popping
[17:32.560 --> 17:38.400]  up like women predominantly, but like to rape them and beat them up and bite them. That's what
[17:38.400 --> 17:44.240]  Bill Clinton does. I'm not, I'm not even getting into sexual, you know, persuasions here. The point
[17:44.240 --> 17:55.040]  is, it is a guild of aberrant, highly, oh, what's the word, promiscuous, risk-taking, wild men.
[17:56.400 --> 18:01.760]  Hundreds of visits by Jeff Gannon alone and a bunch of others he would bring in normally
[18:01.760 --> 18:08.160]  after midnight. Just imagine, you've got Carl Rove, George Bush and the rest of them just in
[18:08.160 --> 18:15.440]  there, in the White House with, with, with scores of gay porn stars. I mean, what? And I bring that
[18:15.440 --> 18:20.560]  up because even if you don't care, they're doing that. Even if that doesn't concern you. I mean,
[18:20.560 --> 18:26.880]  imagine if there was a corporation, a business where, where this was going on at night. I mean,
[18:26.880 --> 18:33.600]  all the dangers, all the problems, all the, it's just, it's just horrible. Just from a business
[18:33.600 --> 18:39.280]  perspective, much less the White House where you have spies wanting to infiltrate it, where you have
[18:39.280 --> 18:44.880]  foreign governments wanting to blackmail and control the total compromised nature of this.
[18:48.480 --> 18:52.880]  And the president starts kissing him on the cheek and hugging him and kissing the top of his head
[18:52.880 --> 18:56.640]  in public. Can't keep his hands off of him.
[18:56.640 --> 19:04.800]  Barak in Washington to lobby for an Iran attack. Paul Joseph Watson wrote this article. It's absolutely
[19:04.800 --> 19:10.800]  key. It's up on prisonplanet.com right now. I'll cover that after the break, but this first,
[19:10.800 --> 19:24.000]  Israeli warplanes practice in Iraq, Israeli Air Force warplanes are practicing in Iraq,
[19:24.000 --> 19:29.440]  airspace and land on US air bases in the country as a preparation for a potential strike on Iran.
[19:29.440 --> 19:34.240]  Sources in the Israeli defense ministry told local news network on Friday. The report, which also
[19:34.240 --> 19:40.560]  was carried by Iranian news outlets, playing the recently massive IAF overnight presence was detected
[19:40.560 --> 19:46.240]  in several American held air base. Iraq denied on Friday reports claiming that Israeli Air Force
[19:46.240 --> 19:54.640]  have been practicing for a possible attack against Iran and its airspace. We'll be right back.
[20:00.000 --> 20:03.120]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order? How do
[20:03.120 --> 20:08.080]  the American people know that not 11 was the stage? Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[20:08.080 --> 20:22.080]  that's for a lateral commission to see far? Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[20:22.080 --> 20:28.640]  a global awakening has taken place. An inside job. How dare you?
[20:31.760 --> 20:35.280]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[20:35.280 --> 20:40.160]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue. And if the government has not told the truth
[20:40.160 --> 20:43.440]  in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of that.
[20:54.320 --> 20:59.440]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors
[20:59.440 --> 21:04.960]  won't talk about gold for your IRA? That's right. Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs
[21:04.960 --> 21:11.440]  since 1986. Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard
[21:11.440 --> 21:17.040]  assets for your retirement. The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments
[21:17.040 --> 21:23.280]  like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs. Perhaps the financial institutions want
[21:23.280 --> 21:28.400]  to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper. If you'd like to take a look at gold
[21:28.400 --> 21:35.600]  for your retirement, call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return
[21:35.600 --> 21:45.920]  on your paper investments. Call 800-686-2237. Make sure that you secure your future. Call 800-686-2237.
[21:45.920 --> 21:55.840]  That's 1-800-686-2237. Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries,
[21:55.840 --> 22:01.120]  high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you. But the symptoms
[22:01.120 --> 22:06.800]  are there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[22:06.800 --> 22:11.600]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong. Here, how heart and body
[22:11.600 --> 22:17.040]  extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America. My blood pressure
[22:17.040 --> 22:22.400]  has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved. Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I
[22:22.400 --> 22:26.400]  look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to
[22:26.400 --> 22:31.840]  everyone. Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a
[22:31.840 --> 22:36.880]  preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy. Order your two-month supply today by

[22:54.640 --> 22:59.440]  about the high price of gasoline. It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're
[22:59.440 --> 23:04.160]  paying record prices at the pump. I have run across a company called SFR who has developed two
[23:04.160 --> 23:09.360]  products that improve gas mileage. Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your
[23:09.360 --> 23:15.600]  injection system, protect a complete fuel system treatment, cleans to 95% of new engine condition,
[23:15.600 --> 23:19.680]  improving mileage, and only one tank full. Protect an engine treatment not only reduces
[23:19.680 --> 23:24.800]  friction, but it extends the life of your engine. Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline,
[23:24.800 --> 23:30.320]  it's time to take action. Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95, and receive
[23:30.320 --> 23:36.880]  a free engine treatment, which is a $12.95 value free. Call 888-888-5305, use SFR-1. That number,
[23:36.880 --> 23:43.600]  again, is 888-888-5305-5305, use SFR-1, or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[23:43.600 --> 23:48.640]  That's oilcompanysecret.com. Satisfaction is guaranteed, or you're money back,

[24:29.600 --> 24:34.080]  You know, the Arab states are always saying Israel's trying to dominate their countries. They
[24:34.080 --> 24:38.320]  don't want Israel involved inside their nations. They say they don't want Israel trying to take
[24:38.320 --> 24:45.600]  their countries over, because Israel has written a lot of public military plans to have the Middle
[24:45.600 --> 24:50.560]  East be called Greater Israel, and to put public governments over each one, and to basically have
[24:50.560 --> 24:54.880]  the countries hand their national resources over to them. And see, the Arab countries have all read
[24:54.880 --> 24:59.520]  this and seen this and know this. They're not under the propaganda mind control that we're under.
[25:00.080 --> 25:03.280]  Okay, we're up as down, and down as up, and black as white, and white as black.
[25:04.400 --> 25:08.400]  And we know there's been Israeli contractors involved in the torture. We know that there's
[25:08.400 --> 25:17.760]  Israeli companies all over Iraq. This just enrages the Arabs, and now Israel has warplanes
[25:18.480 --> 25:25.040]  sitting in Iraq, just a dominated nation five plus years in, a million of them gone,
[25:26.720 --> 25:29.760]  and genocide's being committed, and Israel is sitting there.
[25:31.360 --> 25:36.800]  Hell, they'll probably start building settlements in it, and then there's no end. There's no end.
[25:36.800 --> 25:42.720]  And then I hear this, well, Israel's got to hit. I was on with Mankow, big national show on Monday.
[25:43.680 --> 25:47.520]  He's like, I was just over in Israel, Alex. I understand that hitting Iran's going to make
[25:47.520 --> 25:52.240]  us go into a depression and have us $8 a gallon gas, bare minimum. But we've just got to go ahead
[25:52.240 --> 25:56.720]  and hit them, because, you know, Israel's under threat with nukes, and we've just got to protect
[25:56.720 --> 26:03.120]  poor little Israel. And I'm like, Mankow, they got 400 nukes in a high-tech military. And I'm not
[26:03.120 --> 26:11.680]  quote against Israel, except that Israel constantly pushes for gun control in my country, open borders.
[26:11.680 --> 26:16.800]  Yes, the Israel lobby pushes for all of this, and then they push for starting wars that are
[26:16.800 --> 26:22.960]  going to destroy my country's currency and our name, and I'm mad about it. I mean, I've been
[26:22.960 --> 26:28.160]  criticized for not attacking Israel and not going after all the things they do. I mean,
[26:28.160 --> 26:32.720]  I actually do cover the things Israel does. I just point out that this is what governments do,
[26:32.720 --> 26:38.320]  and that the source of evil on earth is not Israel, but it certainly is one of the sources.
[26:39.680 --> 26:43.520]  I mean, Israel's involved in white slave trafficking like no one else, except maybe the
[26:43.520 --> 26:49.280]  Saudis. Israel's involved in massive narcotics trafficking and ecstasy trafficking and everything
[26:49.280 --> 26:54.640]  else in the US, money laundering. I mean, it's like the Luxembourg of the world, Luxembourg. I mean,
[26:54.640 --> 26:59.040]  that's where you can run and hide if you're an Israeli, commit any crime you want, don't get in
[26:59.040 --> 27:06.720]  trouble. Israel's clearly infesting the Pentagon and the White House and steering this country
[27:06.720 --> 27:16.720]  towards destruction, and it's illegal to preach the gospel in Israel, and I've had Christians
[27:16.720 --> 27:23.520]  defend that and say, well, that's of the Lord. And I'm really tired of all these Christian Zionists
[27:23.520 --> 27:28.160]  saying kill all Palestinian children and shove hang grenades up their rear ends and kill them,
[27:28.160 --> 27:36.000]  and that's Pastor Hagee and Michael Reagan and Israelis run over US citizens with armored
[27:36.000 --> 27:41.920]  vehicles and then laugh and then talk show hosts say good, kill more Americans. We're the bad guys
[27:41.920 --> 27:49.120]  now, the US and Israel, and there's no doubting that. I mean, who could say we aren't?
[27:49.120 --> 27:58.400]  And I think Israel's power, Matt. I mean, Israel is professional focus, very wicked,
[27:58.400 --> 28:02.160]  very cunning, and they think they're invincible, just like Hitler thought, just like Napoleon
[28:02.160 --> 28:09.520]  thought, just like so many others thought, and it's over. I mean, they think because they have
[28:09.520 --> 28:13.920]  the nukes, and the US has the nukes, they can be the new Hitlers and do whatever they want
[28:13.920 --> 28:17.920]  and get away with it. And I'm telling you, that's not the case. They're taking everybody
[28:17.920 --> 28:19.680]  into destruction into Armageddon.
[28:26.160 --> 28:31.840]  According to sources, former military officers in Anbar province said IDF jets arrived during
[28:31.840 --> 28:36.400]  the night from Jordanian airspace, Inter-Irax airspace and land on a runway near the city of
[28:36.400 --> 28:41.120]  Haditha. The sources estimate the jets were preparing for raids on Iran's nuclear sites.
[28:41.120 --> 28:49.680]  Multiple Israeli defense agency sources confirm the sources said the American bases in Iraq
[28:49.680 --> 28:55.760]  may serve as a platform for the IDF from which to attack Iran. Israeli war planes will take off
[28:55.760 --> 29:02.640]  from Iraq. They can reach the reactor in five minutes, a record time, said sources,
[29:02.640 --> 29:08.560]  which was always in the Pentagon and Israeli plans, going back to 1983 and 84 when Saddam was
[29:08.560 --> 29:12.720]  their little boy attacking Iran at the time and killing over a million Iranians.
[29:14.400 --> 29:18.720]  It was the whole time it was to break Iraq up in three pieces, deindustrialize them so they
[29:18.720 --> 29:28.080]  couldn't be leaders, so they could be puppets, vassals, and to then use Iraq as a newly captured
[29:28.080 --> 29:33.440]  protectorate to attack Iran linking up with Afghanistan, then on China's doorstep.
[29:33.440 --> 29:39.280]  This has nothing to do with U.S. interest or for the average interest of an Israeli.
[29:39.280 --> 29:41.520]  This is World War Three.
[29:43.200 --> 29:49.920]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:52.640 --> 29:57.840]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right? First, I get the best parking space

[30:57.280 --> 31:01.920]  worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope. The first time in modern history,
[31:01.920 --> 31:06.320]  the people are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate
[31:06.320 --> 31:10.720]  their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan. We have a short time frame to
[31:10.720 --> 31:16.160]  fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat. In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a

[32:59.520 --> 33:21.680]  radio network. Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m. central standard time we are here
[33:21.680 --> 33:30.800]  live. We are then also live Sundays 4 to 6 p.m. 5 days a week is not enough. We come in on the
[33:30.800 --> 33:36.400]  weekend because so much always happens on Saturday and Sunday. We're going to have him for the next
[33:36.400 --> 33:42.880]  hour and a half and we're going to open the phones up later in the next hour for Mark Kornke.
[33:42.880 --> 33:48.000]  Mark Kornke of course one of the leading figures in the resistance against the New World Order from
[33:48.000 --> 33:54.000]  back in the early 1990s right through to today. Bill Clinton tried to blame him for the Oklahoma
[33:54.000 --> 34:00.320]  city bombing along with a lot of other people just totally made up. McVeigh was running around
[34:00.320 --> 34:04.480]  to hundreds of different patriot groups trying to create a ledger or a history. We now have
[34:04.480 --> 34:08.800]  sworn affidavits confirming that and it's come out that the Southern Providence Law Center was
[34:08.800 --> 34:16.160]  running him and the Elohim city fake white supremacist compound and McVeigh ran all over the
[34:16.160 --> 34:20.880]  country to hundreds of groups Waco you name it to then connect those groups later and then sworn
[34:20.880 --> 34:29.520]  affidavit that is now what Terry Nichols has said there in his federal prison that yes McVeigh said
[34:29.520 --> 34:33.760]  I'm a U.S. government operative I'm doing this for patriotism of course we already knew that had
[34:33.760 --> 34:38.320]  video of him at military bases after he was supposedly out we had the internal state police
[34:38.320 --> 34:42.640]  reports but that's all coming up we'll get marked briefly talk about the history so we can understand
[34:42.640 --> 34:47.760]  the future and then also want to get his take on what's coming up with Iran uh if we go into
[34:47.760 --> 34:53.120]  martial law how he thinks he things will unfold mark's got a great sharp mind and of course it
[34:53.120 --> 35:00.080]  worked with army intelligence as well and has woken up so many countless people so we're really
[35:00.080 --> 35:07.440]  happy to have mark joining us today but folks I released truth rising on July 4th because I could
[35:07.440 --> 35:13.040]  have waited to the fall to release it which is always a better time for video sales to release
[35:13.040 --> 35:19.600]  a film but because it needs to be seen by everyone I released it literally within just a few weeks
[35:19.600 --> 35:27.920]  of it being done as we released it the day before the DVDs arrived from being mass produced and I'll
[35:27.920 --> 35:33.280]  just be point blank with the audience there's a huge buzz on the internet it has been ripped all
[35:33.280 --> 35:40.480]  over the web which we want it is getting already millions of views on google and hundreds of thousands
[35:40.480 --> 35:45.120]  on youtube and it's all over the file sharing networks one of the biggest files being downloaded
[35:45.120 --> 35:51.360]  on the file sharing networks and that's great but we need to get outside the internet audience
[35:51.360 --> 35:58.400]  you know it's it's amazing that you can have something be seen by more than a million people
[35:58.400 --> 36:10.640]  in a week but then you can sell a few hundred of them and the film cost $70,000 to make I mean I
[36:10.640 --> 36:14.240]  paid the people most of them for the footage we got who were 911 traders even though they were
[36:14.240 --> 36:18.800]  offering it for free I would still pay them I had to fly to New York twice go all over the place
[36:18.800 --> 36:26.160]  pay for the music to be made two years making this $70,000 and at the rate we are selling these we
[36:26.160 --> 36:31.200]  will never even pay it off and so I would ask listeners who've seen it online even if you're
[36:31.200 --> 36:39.200]  a prison planet dot tv member you've seen it in high quality to order the dvd at info wars.com
[36:39.200 --> 36:45.040]  the dvd needs to be seen plus it's in super high quality it's a great encoding it was shot in high
[36:45.040 --> 36:51.280]  depth but then crunched down to the the regular dvd format so it plays on the players but it looks
[36:51.280 --> 36:57.680]  like film and it is it is an amazing the history of the 911 truth movement how the globalist carried
[36:57.680 --> 37:04.000]  out the attacks the key info uh how the police are trying to set up 911 truthers trying to plant
[37:04.000 --> 37:09.120]  bombs on us how the media is attacking us in a concerted effort it's important to say who we are
[37:09.120 --> 37:14.080]  and it grows the movement and it shows people how to take over media events evidence by two days
[37:14.080 --> 37:22.800]  ago cnn fox abc live on c span huge news uh they brought up and we are changed 911 truth
[37:22.800 --> 37:27.520]  brought up questions to mccain we're going to mark in a minute but i've got to get this out and get
[37:27.520 --> 37:32.000]  a stake on it brought up questions to mccain about well you were the guy that founded peanut
[37:32.560 --> 37:37.120]  project from american century that called for terror attacks in the u.s they read quotes from it
[37:37.120 --> 37:43.520]  and mccain looks down gets upset and looks really scared and turns and walks away the body language
[37:43.520 --> 37:48.880]  is to anybody who doesn't even have criminology training to just a layman is my god he looks
[37:48.880 --> 37:53.760]  like you know you just pulled out the murder weapon in front of him and then he he stumbles
[37:53.760 --> 37:59.600]  through it and everybody saw this for what it was i mean in the film we went and confronted gary
[37:59.600 --> 38:05.520]  hart and he admits yes the u.s government stages terror attacks this is the head cfr guy who was
[38:05.520 --> 38:12.960]  clearly involved folks they are cracking up we have shaken them up they've got all this arrogance
[38:12.960 --> 38:19.760]  all this aplomb all the toots ball all this uh bravada and it's falling apart now and major
[38:19.760 --> 38:24.560]  polls show the majority know they did it but let me tell you something if we don't fully expend our
[38:24.560 --> 38:31.680]  energy now waking up people that don't know it's an inside job and showing the uh the social proof
[38:31.680 --> 38:35.600]  of how big we've gotten they're going to be able to carry out more attacks and then it's going to
[38:35.600 --> 38:42.160]  be a hot war it isn't going to be pretty we can fully discredit them folks i've got stacks of news
[38:42.160 --> 38:46.560]  here and i want to get into that with mark later but i got to get to mark where we now have identified
[38:47.120 --> 38:53.680]  who the prime suspects are with the thermate who the bombers are their names uh and we've
[38:53.680 --> 38:59.600]  got engineers like kevin ryan coming out physicists like steven jones coming out with their names
[38:59.600 --> 39:06.720]  we have got uh it is exponentially growing it is people are paying attention now we've engineered
[39:06.720 --> 39:14.960]  uh reverse engineered back who did it how they did it everything i mean we're getting close folks
[39:14.960 --> 39:21.200]  and that means the enemy is dangerous okay the enemy is dangerous and attacking iran is like a
[39:21.200 --> 39:26.000]  bank robber when they're in the corner grabbing a hostage they need a war to smoke screen it or
[39:26.000 --> 39:32.240]  staging a nuke attack they could do anything and so we need to get truth rising out on dvd
[39:32.240 --> 39:36.880]  also because they can shut the web down and then you're not going to have a way of really getting
[39:36.880 --> 39:42.720]  these around the people we need folks if you've got an old car go sell it get five thousand dollars
[39:42.720 --> 39:48.400]  go buy a dvd duplicator for a hundred bucks buy five thousand blanks and make copies and have your
[39:48.400 --> 39:54.880]  area knee deep i mean you better get aggressive right now this is the maximum effort right at the
[39:54.880 --> 40:01.120]  end we are at the very end here folks before the next level and we're going to shape what that next
[40:01.120 --> 40:05.440]  level is are we going to let them have uh the momentum are we going to let them be on the
[40:05.440 --> 40:12.480]  offense as we go into a hot war or are we uh going to be on the offensive ourselves and kick
[40:12.480 --> 40:17.040]  their butt mark cornkey what do you say to that analysis well actually that's one of the most
[40:17.040 --> 40:22.960]  important things alex right now is that everybody needs to simply speak their mind and we watch the
[40:22.960 --> 40:29.360]  response of the characters around you i do this every day every place i go two things happen number
[40:29.360 --> 40:34.400]  one i've got people walking up to you have known me for probably more pretty much all my life and
[40:34.400 --> 40:37.840]  some of them are quiet they didn't want to say anything back we were trying to explain about
[40:37.840 --> 40:44.720]  things like the mjtf uh the dropping of us borders the attack on our sovereignty but now they're
[40:44.720 --> 40:49.440]  coming up and going either either they're saying two things what do i do that's the my favorite
[40:49.440 --> 40:54.400]  and what what do you think is going to start now these are people who were before were always
[40:54.400 --> 40:58.960]  staying in the periphery or they all well i don't think it'll happen in my lifetime the problem is
[40:58.960 --> 41:04.240]  this for these people the most important thing that changed them is that years ago i didn't
[41:04.240 --> 41:09.440]  hesitate to say here's what's going to happen this is what they're up to this is who they are
[41:09.440 --> 41:14.000]  this is where it's going now everybody out there listening needs to do the same thing and one of
[41:14.000 --> 41:19.920]  the things about videos remember when you walk away that video is still there if a person with a
[41:19.920 --> 41:25.760]  dvd in hand looks at it and gets a little overwhelmed what they'll do is they can shut it off
[41:25.760 --> 41:29.920]  they can walk away i know a lot of people have told me this you know i watched what you were
[41:29.920 --> 41:34.560]  saying and i had to shut it off because i had to sit and think for a while i had to mull it over
[41:34.560 --> 41:39.840]  i had to work it because there's just so much information which is true however one of the
[41:39.840 --> 41:44.000]  most important things we need to understand is we are dealing just as you said with a criminal
[41:44.000 --> 41:51.520]  set of minds these criminals are involved in high treason that is the simplest way to describe it
[41:51.520 --> 41:59.440]  they are they are employees that are betraying us the employers and they have sold out to the
[41:59.440 --> 42:06.560]  devil in a number of different forms and have now murdered americans openly now we've done it before
[42:06.560 --> 42:11.120]  we watched waco everybody saw that on national television and that was a combination of foreign
[42:11.120 --> 42:16.000]  troops combined with u.s secret police forces slash you know the alphabet soup agents and they later
[42:16.000 --> 42:22.160]  admitted it was a laboratory uh test even in newsweek and mark think about all the chemical
[42:22.160 --> 42:28.560]  biological testing murdering our troops murdering foster children with radiation all declassified
[42:28.560 --> 42:33.840]  30 40 50 years ago as they were creating the murder cadres that would even kill their own people
[42:35.360 --> 42:39.840]  exactly one of the things most important to remember too is that if we are seeing and this
[42:39.840 --> 42:44.080]  is where you got a challenge everybody's mind operation northwood still the best example
[42:44.080 --> 42:49.840]  okay we all have that as public documents that came out i'd be willing to bet that a percentage
[42:49.840 --> 42:54.480]  already were scrambled and dragged back in and reclassified by this administration it wouldn't
[42:54.480 --> 42:59.840]  have made a difference which one was in here if it was a carry ring knocker a or bushite to the
[42:59.840 --> 43:05.440]  adventure continues either way it would have still ended up in the same result that they realized
[43:05.440 --> 43:10.320]  that well because the machine is so big papers were being pushed out partially now i will say
[43:10.320 --> 43:14.560]  this you gotta remember there's a lot of americans in the system no no we know they're being leaked
[43:14.560 --> 43:18.320]  yeah that's right the people are throwing this stuff out there like how can we get this to people
[43:18.320 --> 43:23.120]  because we had to do this years ago how can you know what did the navy what did the navy say
[43:23.120 --> 43:29.040]  in the washington post on september 10th they said israel will probably stage a terror attack in
[43:29.040 --> 43:35.200]  the u.s to go into iraq they put that in the washington post the day before to warn people
[43:35.200 --> 43:38.640]  well they and now let's touch that on him and we're gonna go to youtube and you probably got
[43:38.640 --> 43:43.440]  this already remember the supposed arabs that weren't there israelis that were on the van cheering
[43:43.440 --> 43:48.960]  when the when the towers were hit the basic question has to be asked is this to anybody with
[43:48.960 --> 43:53.600]  any common sense and the police already asked this question how would you know to have the van
[43:53.600 --> 43:59.200]  there how would you know to be dressed as arabs when you're in it when you're israelis and how
[43:59.200 --> 44:05.040]  would you know to have the camera set up to take in the right shot you see the problem just with
[44:05.040 --> 44:10.320]  stuff like that uh... with all of the actions with regard to the terrorists in general which
[44:10.320 --> 44:14.720]  are the elements of our government people say well what would somebody know a whole lot of
[44:14.720 --> 44:20.000]  people do know and the hardest thing when you get into actions that are as intricate as this is
[44:20.000 --> 44:27.360]  you have to get past the one problem trained professionals see alex everybody has a skill
[44:27.360 --> 44:32.240]  everybody has a trade we work in production radio production we understand how to make radio work
[44:32.240 --> 44:35.760]  how many people out there have been in the air force and know how the air force works
[44:35.760 --> 44:40.720]  how many people know how the air force responds to aircraft when they're off course in the us
[44:41.520 --> 44:46.640]  now how many people understand how the f a a works and flight air traffic control
[44:47.360 --> 44:51.600]  you have to get past the f a a people and you have to get past the air force
[44:51.600 --> 44:58.080]  and make people believe that for aircraft were flying around the u s uh... on unconsensored
[44:58.080 --> 45:04.000]  for hours for any and in the middle of the highest air traffic control district and the
[45:04.000 --> 45:10.240]  holy of holies for air defense washington dc now if you believe that they don't like it said
[45:10.240 --> 45:14.720]  you your stone cold stupid you know the rest is history the bottom line is you gotta get past
[45:14.720 --> 45:21.600]  the f a a and you gotta get past the air force and they ain't gonna happen so if it did you gotta
[45:21.600 --> 45:28.000]  ask who got in the way of it and then how do you have drills on nine eleven of the exact same
[45:28.000 --> 45:34.080]  targets being hit at the exact same time with the pentagon and norad super imposing over
[45:35.040 --> 45:40.640]  the f a a and everybody else's screens fake blips and you hear on the tape saying i've never seen
[45:40.640 --> 45:44.560]  so much real world during an exercise and get these blips off my screen
[45:44.560 --> 45:47.840]  i mean all of this is going on but but going back to the info war
[45:49.120 --> 45:55.280]  i know it's shaking the enemy up mark that that's so many people now know it's an inside job
[45:55.280 --> 46:00.720]  that the term inside job self-inflicted wound false flag is now common knowledge
[46:00.720 --> 46:07.360]  that polls show the majority know it's an inside job i know the globalists weren't counting on us
[46:07.360 --> 46:12.160]  aggressively exposing their operation well that's the other key thing here at one thing we will
[46:12.160 --> 46:16.400]  remind everybody we are in what are the most dangerous times because as you said when a
[46:16.400 --> 46:21.440]  criminal gets caught and that's what's happened here these criminals have been caught literally
[46:21.440 --> 46:25.680]  with their hand in the cookie jar all the way up to their armpit it's kind of like they snuck in
[46:25.680 --> 46:29.520]  the kitchen they're up on the high chair they've got their arm in the cookie jar and you walk in
[46:29.520 --> 46:34.880]  and hit the light switch from the ceiling you've got this whole me expression of course like or
[46:34.880 --> 46:39.760]  like an owl caught in the headlights and these characters realize that there's no place to turn
[46:39.760 --> 46:45.680]  now here's what appears the problem oklahoma the reason oklahoma took place is because the ring
[46:45.680 --> 46:52.800]  knockers the the the spit swappers all were in in trouble and it was a reaction it was not a
[46:52.800 --> 46:59.840]  response even nine eleven s was was desperation it was a reaction not a response it was it was
[46:59.840 --> 47:05.360]  fabricated and it was hoping to get certain things moving but because of its intricacies
[47:05.360 --> 47:10.880]  in and of itself that created the problem for them if they try another foolishness like this
[47:10.880 --> 47:17.360]  so you know there was nuking a city or doing whatever too many people are up to speed you're
[47:17.360 --> 47:23.760]  not working in a vacuum anymore we're all watching right now and we in the last seven years have
[47:23.760 --> 47:30.400]  gotten very advanced as an organic uh... you know truly grassroots intelligence network
[47:30.400 --> 47:35.760]  and our people are now everywhere police departments high command in the military
[47:35.760 --> 47:40.560]  state governments our people are everywhere and we're not trying to sound big here folks i don't
[47:40.560 --> 47:46.800]  even want to even say how many people i know we've got it is incredible mark i mean they are a paper
[47:46.800 --> 47:52.080]  tiger but if they can bark and try to intimidate us they're going to win if we can just realize
[47:52.080 --> 47:57.280]  that we're going to win uh... and that the idea is bulletproof they can kill a mark corn here in
[47:57.280 --> 48:03.520]  alex jones they cannot uh... win if we just keep on coming well again the important thing is
[48:03.520 --> 48:07.920]  everybody out there listening needs to do their part and again you need to speak up now if you
[48:07.920 --> 48:14.080]  uh... as it is my problem is this i argue that the other side is going to do something stupid
[48:14.080 --> 48:19.280]  one way or another they're going to get desperate because we have we don't like the technology
[48:19.280 --> 48:24.320]  here's the thing people were not into the police state however just because we don't like the
[48:24.320 --> 48:31.680]  technology doesn't mean that we don't know how to use it see that's what everybody that's the other
[48:31.680 --> 48:37.200]  side where they really glitched out here because we are from the techno we know techno world are
[48:37.200 --> 48:41.680]  all the guys that i went to school with went to silicon valley the people i went personally
[48:41.680 --> 48:47.360]  school with i went into aerospace engineering and i did i that got me into the intel field and
[48:47.360 --> 48:52.880]  there's a whole long story on that but the point is all of us many of us are all still interconnected
[48:52.880 --> 48:58.320]  we've known each other for forty years thirty five years twenty five years and these people all
[48:58.320 --> 49:04.720]  have the same interest that our listeners have right now they all have applied their technologies
[49:04.720 --> 49:10.960]  to monitor and to more closely observe the enemy and they're under the microscope here's the thing
[49:10.960 --> 49:15.440]  think about this all the listeners right now they're on this radio this this program right now
[49:16.000 --> 49:21.280]  how many of them have cell phone cameras how many of them have throwaway cameras how many of them
[49:21.280 --> 49:26.800]  virtually can give you on time delivery of an event as it's taking place without them
[49:27.840 --> 49:33.760]  destroying you all need to think of yourselves is what you are the last ditch defense of the
[49:33.760 --> 49:40.320]  republic and free humanity on a planetary scale you literally are the solution you are the info
[49:40.320 --> 49:45.280]  warriors and unfortunately may have to be the physical fighters if this continues and it is
[49:45.280 --> 49:51.360]  going to continue it's it you're it folks you are in a combat zone with an occupied country with a
[49:51.360 --> 49:57.040]  brainwashed population and it's your job to go in behind enemy lines and unlock their minds
[49:57.040 --> 50:01.200]  exactly one of the interesting things too is we have to be both in the balanced with the
[50:01.200 --> 50:07.360]  ethereal world of the mind and the physical world being prepared to actually defend ourselves and
[50:07.360 --> 50:12.880]  wage effective war we must support the militia you must be part of the militia even if it is as
[50:12.880 --> 50:18.000]  just as an individual for the moment you must be part of the information base in fact the basic
[50:18.000 --> 50:24.480]  rule is this what Heinlein said it best human beings are able to do virtually anything every human
[50:24.480 --> 50:29.760]  being listening has the ability to have many different skills ingrained upon their minds so
[50:29.760 --> 50:34.720]  that they are generalists rather than just specialists and that's what we need people we
[50:34.720 --> 50:39.520]  need a million million generalists out there that can do anything necessary so that we can
[50:39.520 --> 50:44.320]  replace one another as need be and by the way the problem absolutely if the globalists take over
[50:44.320 --> 50:48.800]  folks we could take the country back with butter knives mark will explain that when we get back
[50:52.640 --> 50:57.680]  did you know that ph balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and

[55:42.800 --> 55:48.480]  here's an example how many people remember when we came out with american peril uh 1993 uh was
[55:48.480 --> 55:56.160]  while weco is taking place i specifically explained the process of mjtf forces multi-jurisdictional
[55:56.160 --> 56:03.280]  task force mjtf elements are being expanded upon and now publicly talked about in the most
[56:03.280 --> 56:10.080]  liberal of cities let me give an example right here in washington county and an arbor michigan
[56:10.080 --> 56:15.520]  you know california on the here on as we call it uh... we have now another force you need to
[56:15.520 --> 56:22.240]  watch for mobile field forces does that sound like a combat operation doesn't sound like military
[56:22.240 --> 56:26.320]  formation of the field forces what teams now put the number of people they've killed on the side
[56:26.320 --> 56:32.800]  of there some of their tanks mff mobile field force 102 officers uh... from around the county

[1:00:14.480 --> 1:00:19.920]  country for more than 80 years has done tens of thousands of declassified chemical biological
[1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:25.520]  radiological tests on every major city they have killed tens of thousands we know of
[1:00:25.520 --> 1:00:31.120]  including police and military police military you've been slowly brainwashed and compartmentalized
[1:00:31.120 --> 1:00:35.520]  you have now been federalized you know you've been doing drills of rounding up the children
[1:00:35.520 --> 1:00:41.360]  we told you about this years before it became mainstream news now they've trained 26 000 preachers
[1:00:41.360 --> 1:00:46.640]  to give sermons saying hand your guns in take force inoculations now under federal grants
[1:00:46.640 --> 1:00:51.280]  they're taking blood without warrants in many areas and other areas with kangaroo rubber stamp
[1:00:51.280 --> 1:00:57.840]  warrants they are gearing up for total federalization it's now all in the pdd 51 and john warner
[1:00:57.840 --> 1:01:03.760]  defense authorization act mark corn g fight the new world order for decades is our guest mark
[1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:08.960]  continue with how you see how how you see them moving against us with the federalized forces
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:13.680]  how you would see this unfolding well in escalation first of all for take place it has to have a
[1:01:13.680 --> 1:01:18.880]  pimple event in other words as we've talked about either a nuclear strike against a metropolitan
[1:01:18.880 --> 1:01:25.600]  area done by in covert and covert elements it won't be a foreign power in fact uh let's put it
[1:01:25.600 --> 1:01:31.040]  this way the chinese were given control over uh... casco monitored radiate radiological monitoring
[1:01:31.040 --> 1:01:37.200]  sites in the caribbean remember years ago now uh... they bring stuff in costly where we don't
[1:01:37.200 --> 1:01:41.680]  even get a chance to scan it so even if we had honorable americans running the equipment
[1:01:41.680 --> 1:01:48.000]  well they aren't the chinese are foreign powers are rockefeller said the chinese system the
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:53.280]  communists are are the epitome of what he would like to see america's really now if that's the
[1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:57.440]  case then we can see the writing on the wall so what's going to happen here is they'll probably
[1:01:57.440 --> 1:02:04.080]  try to sacrifice uh... at least one site one one area however they always have duality and purpose
[1:02:04.080 --> 1:02:09.760]  just as you see with nine eleven if they do this they always in order to get more criminals involved
[1:02:09.760 --> 1:02:15.040]  in the criminal action they have to be profitable for them uh... one of the sites i would keep an eye
[1:02:15.040 --> 1:02:21.120]  out for is jackson bill florida well it sounds weird but one of the reasons jackson bill is that
[1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:25.280]  remember we're getting rid of the last of and they might even sacrifice it which may be why they
[1:02:25.280 --> 1:02:30.320]  left it floating we only have one diesel powered uh... aircraft carrier left in service it's being
[1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:34.080]  held over for the moment which used to didn't have all our eggs in one basket we had diesel
[1:02:34.080 --> 1:02:39.600]  and nuclear just in case that went wrong well that site is a p o l site jackson bill like
[1:02:39.600 --> 1:02:44.400]  a couple of other facilities are big e p a cleanup problems just like the world trade center on top
[1:02:44.400 --> 1:02:49.440]  of everything else was a big asbestos issue there's a lot of people who have private funded
[1:02:49.440 --> 1:02:54.640]  uh... facilities that are tied in with the aircraft carrier support groups if they had
[1:02:54.640 --> 1:02:59.520]  to fix it it would cost a lot if they'll also attack wherever they have a large intelligence
[1:02:59.520 --> 1:03:03.760]  nest because then they can have their people already in place and already trusted to help
[1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:09.920]  carry it out same model with the spook compound and the emergency management center in the c i a
[1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:13.920]  uh... uh... based in the nest at building seven
[1:03:13.920 --> 1:03:18.000]  being an interesting thing about that is i don't believe they were supposed to survive alex
[1:03:18.880 --> 1:03:23.760]  you know if you think about it we count the planes and clout count the targets the last
[1:03:23.760 --> 1:03:27.840]  plane or whatever it was it's got it into pennsylvania
[1:03:27.840 --> 1:03:32.720]  four targets four buildings go down only three of them get hit by planes
[1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:36.240]  now if you think about it one of the things to remember is there's a lot of people who
[1:03:36.240 --> 1:03:41.280]  didn't know what's going on but what i would say openly on the air to everybody listening
[1:03:41.280 --> 1:03:46.480]  right now especially to the people on the other side how many men were sitting in that building
[1:03:46.480 --> 1:03:51.520]  in building seven that were sitting there when somebody else said i gotta go for a cup of coffee
[1:03:51.520 --> 1:03:56.880]  you know what i mean in other words what group or click may have left the building
[1:03:56.880 --> 1:04:01.120]  well we know who they were we know who they were yeah but and that's what everybody else was
[1:04:01.120 --> 1:04:06.320]  but everybody else was left there holding the monitor so to speak if everything had gone
[1:04:06.320 --> 1:04:12.160]  the way it was supposed to all of the other multi-agency witnesses who were not in the
[1:04:12.160 --> 1:04:19.200]  circle would have been sacrificed to to eliminate the history that you people have now put together
[1:04:19.200 --> 1:04:25.600]  and for those that don't know it is confirmed that there was some unknown agency on the emergency
[1:04:25.600 --> 1:04:31.680]  loudspeaker system in tower one and two telling everyone they could have gotten out for 30 minutes
[1:04:31.680 --> 1:04:38.880]  this is an order stay at your desk help is on the ways do not leave the building because they
[1:04:38.880 --> 1:04:43.760]  needed to have some people die the word was out so half the buildings were more than half empty
[1:04:43.760 --> 1:04:48.560]  that day from what they normally were and uh there's an incredible article that paul watson did

[1:08:50.400 --> 1:08:53.600]  on target and i just want to back up everything he's saying but i've got to control myself
[1:08:53.600 --> 1:09:00.800]  to let him go with the info but remember uh the head of fema for new york
[1:09:01.840 --> 1:09:07.440]  kennedy went on the night of 9 11 and said well we were there the night before before 9 11
[1:09:08.160 --> 1:09:13.200]  for a anti-terror drill see showing he wasn't involved most of these people are compartmentalized
[1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:18.080]  and aren't and and and then uh peter jennings is like excuse me he goes yeah we arrived
[1:09:18.080 --> 1:09:25.200]  around see the night before we set up down on the pier you see the agencies the cia the fbi
[1:09:25.200 --> 1:09:30.000]  they were all asking questions they all were told to pull out they were all down the pier
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:34.880]  and mobile command centers and then the secret service and others weren't told to pull out
[1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:39.200]  but they did pull out one guy thought something was suspicious he got killed and thrown in the
[1:09:39.200 --> 1:09:44.400]  building along with john o'neill so they were killing some fbi and some secret service uh others
[1:09:44.400 --> 1:09:49.200]  with the city emergency management showed up and then got phone calls and said get out of there
[1:09:49.200 --> 1:09:54.640]  this is before tower one and two even fell and others got warnings before that even happened
[1:09:54.640 --> 1:10:00.640]  then then fema said no we weren't there the the day before then the documents came out in the
[1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:06.960]  even the 9 11 whitewash commission it was admitted they were there juliani testified they were told
[1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:13.760]  to get out on uh again with peter jennings on abc but also before the commission then he lied and
[1:10:13.760 --> 1:10:19.280]  said he'd never said it that is all in truth rising and so it's not just they did all the
[1:10:19.280 --> 1:10:24.880]  suspicious stuff they then lie about it and folks i've got to say it now i want to be clear on this
[1:10:25.600 --> 1:10:29.600]  israel and the united states are wedded to the hip just like the british so when i say the british
[1:10:29.600 --> 1:10:34.320]  the israelis the u.s it isn't singling out the british or the americans or the israelis it isn't
[1:10:34.320 --> 1:10:41.760]  the people of those nations it's those governments and this angle american slash zionist monster
[1:10:41.760 --> 1:10:47.120]  um i've really been analyzing it the problem is there's so many disinfo people about israel
[1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:51.600]  and so many of them are hateful and liars about me and other things that it almost made me shy
[1:10:51.600 --> 1:10:56.400]  away from it for a long time but i've actually been doing an in-depth deep analysis of this
[1:10:57.040 --> 1:11:02.880]  and it is true that you had known admitted massad agents people whose mothers and fathers
[1:11:02.880 --> 1:11:10.640]  founded israel known dual citizens all working and there's an article today wtc seven emergency
[1:11:10.640 --> 1:11:15.040]  head was building collapse specialist he was running things and then he comes out and puts
[1:11:15.040 --> 1:11:19.760]  out the official story of fire of the collapse they had other weird guys on the streets all
[1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:27.440]  reading the same script within minutes i mean this is red-handed folks uh so definitely major
[1:11:27.440 --> 1:11:31.920]  massad element and i know people pointed that out before and i said certainly they were involved
[1:11:31.920 --> 1:11:37.680]  somehow but more and more uh... it it and folks i'm a big fish i'm on the front lines of this
[1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:42.320]  this is very dangerous for me to you know to come right out with us but i am because the truth
[1:11:42.320 --> 1:11:46.720]  is the truth mark cornkey this is getting dangerous well one of the things to remember is
[1:11:46.720 --> 1:11:51.520]  uh... with the even within the intelligence circles and the military we had a lot of people
[1:11:51.520 --> 1:11:57.360]  who immediately could see what was wrong one of the things real quick to consider the response
[1:11:57.360 --> 1:12:01.040]  to whatever happened in pennsylvania and again let's just leave that up in the air we don't
[1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:04.560]  know what was shot down we know something was knocked down okay
[1:12:04.560 --> 1:12:09.760]  it wasn't it didn't wasn't taken down by a takeover from within it was eliminated by somebody
[1:12:09.760 --> 1:12:14.800]  in the military command structure who finally said you know throw something out there
[1:12:14.800 --> 1:12:19.680]  now one of the rules here with regard to aircraft i want everybody to understand when i say holy
[1:12:19.680 --> 1:12:26.080]  of holies remember washington dc is the core of everything with regard to national defense
[1:12:26.080 --> 1:12:33.840]  short of our nuclear arsenal okay so for anybody to believe that washington dc did not have
[1:12:33.840 --> 1:12:40.240]  air defense capabilities both for lift launch of say fighter aircraft or missile defense
[1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:44.640]  commands of one form or another you know again pull your head out of your hind end think for a
[1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:49.920]  minute thirty days before or actually longer than that remember we had a kid try to land a
[1:12:49.920 --> 1:12:54.400]  twin a single engineer craft on the white house lawn do you remember that alex yes
[1:12:54.400 --> 1:12:59.680]  and they announced automatically that they had restructured the air defense command mechanism
[1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:05.600]  and had put it on a heightened state of alert then you're supposed to believe that a oh wait a
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:13.440]  minute a large jet aircraft floats around washington dc do do do do do do and nobody
[1:13:13.440 --> 1:13:19.680]  responds to it let me stop you you have for at least thirty eight minutes the aid coming in
[1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:23.680]  and saying it's a hundred miles it's fifty miles it's thirty miles because the order still stand
[1:13:23.680 --> 1:13:28.640]  dick cheney says of course it still stands with the secretary of transportation norma menetta
[1:13:28.640 --> 1:13:34.400]  as the eyewitness and others so we know there's missile batteries all over dc on top the pentagon
[1:13:34.400 --> 1:13:39.360]  on top the white house and they just let it come right on in and the thing about this guys is for
[1:13:39.360 --> 1:13:43.680]  all of our people listening remember there were good men and women in uniform trying to stop this
[1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:50.000]  or that superseded orders that were given to them now one of the aircraft admittedly had that day
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:57.040]  super secret national security council code it was broadcasting the stand down code yes now tie in
[1:13:57.040 --> 1:14:01.200]  with this another thing remember there was an aircraft that was seen above washington that
[1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:06.160]  everybody's seen the video of now right they admit that's the doomsday aircraft now here's the problem
[1:14:06.160 --> 1:14:12.880]  of that i want to rub this in guys that plane does not go anywhere without fighter escort combat
[1:14:12.880 --> 1:14:19.760]  loaded think about that now alex this is another example this is the smoking a smoking gun from
[1:14:19.760 --> 1:14:25.280]  another perspective guys men women who have been in the air force how many times if you watch that
[1:14:25.280 --> 1:14:32.240]  aircraft land and takeoff there are always aircraft in front of an aircraft behind it
[1:14:32.240 --> 1:14:39.920]  and there is also a tactical top cover made up of combat operational aircraft if that plane
[1:14:39.920 --> 1:14:47.280]  was flying over washington dc there were combat attack aircraft around it constantly
[1:14:47.280 --> 1:14:52.880]  and yet none of them responded to what happened to the pentagon
[1:14:55.040 --> 1:15:01.520]  how is that possible well they only one way it's called treason for 40 years the pentagon's been
[1:15:01.520 --> 1:15:07.280]  rang by all sorts of uh any aircraft missiles that's right in fact look at jenna well i'm just
[1:15:07.280 --> 1:15:12.080]  saying even if we didn't even if somebody said well there's no such thing everybody who's ever
[1:15:12.080 --> 1:15:18.320]  this why i said trained professionals are the keys to this everybody knows they're part of the job
[1:15:18.320 --> 1:15:22.960]  some people fill the air the fuel tanks on the aircraft to support that plane
[1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:29.520]  some people fix the aircraft that support that plane some of them fix that aircraft others were
[1:15:29.520 --> 1:15:34.560]  involved at one point or another and have been in an airbase and watched how it operates all of
[1:15:34.560 --> 1:15:38.720]  a sudden we have to believe that the whole system went into catatonic brain fart and didn't know how
[1:15:38.720 --> 1:15:42.960]  to do its job and that's impossible well we know that a month and a half before and it's in two of
[1:15:42.960 --> 1:15:49.120]  my films it's in marshal law we know that uh dick cheney uh took control of the first
[1:15:49.120 --> 1:15:54.720]  times his norab was set up in the fifties to his personal control so no general or admiral
[1:15:54.720 --> 1:15:59.680]  or their designate could order to shoot down he took the default setting off and then they
[1:15:59.680 --> 1:16:06.640]  approached him and he said no stand down and so i mean we have them mark why do you think they
[1:16:06.640 --> 1:16:12.160]  thought we were so dumb i guess they were playing in a 1960s era when they controlled the major
[1:16:12.160 --> 1:16:17.520]  newspapers and the tv and that was that's part of it right there actually what you got to remember
[1:16:17.520 --> 1:16:23.440]  two things number one once you get criminals into a position of command and control they have to hire
[1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:27.840]  other criminals that are dumber than they are or they choose now i'm not saying the whole group
[1:16:27.840 --> 1:16:32.080]  i'm talking about command and control because you got to remember cnc personnel are a narrow
[1:16:32.080 --> 1:16:38.160]  bottleneck and what they do is a they have to pick other yes men who are not as bright as they are
[1:16:38.160 --> 1:16:42.000]  so that in the middle of the night they don't feel that sharp executive letter opener between
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:48.400]  their shoulder blades okay with this being the case what's happened is they have isolated themselves
[1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:53.840]  the cnc personnel perceive one thing because it's the picture that's been painted for them
[1:16:53.840 --> 1:16:58.320]  because the yes men will look to see what the response was as they were feeding information
[1:16:58.320 --> 1:17:04.400]  to command operations now the problem is what they've been feeding them with ignorance is not
[1:17:04.400 --> 1:17:09.600]  the perspective of what's been happening across the nation with regard to the intelligence process
[1:17:09.600 --> 1:17:14.720]  built up by the patriot movement the militia effort in general and americans as a whole
[1:17:15.600 --> 1:17:20.960]  the washington dc has truly become baradur within mordor you know little i'm going to say the mile
[1:17:20.960 --> 1:17:27.680]  the the square is is now mordor and in the middle baradur has isolated itself to the point where
[1:17:27.680 --> 1:17:34.880]  even though it has the roving all-seeing eye it can't grasp the tactical it doesn't understand
[1:17:34.880 --> 1:17:41.280]  anymore just exactly how far in advance and how info how how integrated not infiltrated but
[1:17:41.280 --> 1:17:47.120]  integrated our intelligence processes are because americans are speaking to and handing
[1:17:47.120 --> 1:17:52.080]  information off to americans on a level that they they just inconceivable there's an exponential
[1:17:52.080 --> 1:17:59.040]  growth curve of knowledge and the enemy knows that i mean look always they could fool us with
[1:17:59.040 --> 1:18:02.880]  the left right paradigm the left would be in and the right would be in and one party would have a
[1:18:02.880 --> 1:18:07.600]  high approval rating the other a low approval rating now congress has a nine percent in scientific
[1:18:07.600 --> 1:18:14.400]  polls the president has below a 20 dick cheney has below a 10 uh both parties are hated you've
[1:18:14.400 --> 1:18:19.440]  got a few million idiots that still support each party i mean they've really blown it mark i mean
[1:18:19.440 --> 1:18:23.840]  they really i mean the people now know they're the enemy they don't know the full scale of the
[1:18:23.840 --> 1:18:29.440]  horror but uh that is certainly a great victory for us well to win and this is most important
[1:18:29.440 --> 1:18:34.880]  is people who do cannot expect a silver bullet from above instead what's going to have to happen
[1:18:34.880 --> 1:18:41.440]  is we are going to win tactically on a massive scale everybody listening has to have food reserves
[1:18:41.440 --> 1:18:46.560]  in place everybody listening here's one of the things they're talking think about this people
[1:18:46.560 --> 1:18:52.400]  they're talking about food rationing and riots in the spring time of america we have a whole
[1:18:52.400 --> 1:18:57.360]  planting seed ahead of a season ahead of us and you have not heard once the department of agriculture
[1:18:57.360 --> 1:19:03.360]  come forward and say we perceive a national emergency we need to grow extra plants we never
[1:19:03.360 --> 1:19:08.080]  buy to put in gardens you don't hear a single government in fact if it was a serious and it
[1:19:08.080 --> 1:19:12.160]  is serious but they're going to make it a situation they're conditioning everybody
[1:19:12.160 --> 1:19:16.160]  they're prepping it as if we know this is the best they can do just like new orleans will they
[1:19:16.160 --> 1:19:21.520]  order a stand down then people starve and die and they say oh we need more power instead we need to
[1:19:21.520 --> 1:19:25.760]  be doing what they're not everybody listening out there if you want to change the battlefield
[1:19:25.760 --> 1:19:32.720]  change your backyard they'll put a garden in now america needs to grow food and we need to do it
[1:19:32.720 --> 1:19:38.800]  in every way that we can that's one of the many ways and it's nonviolent it's defensive it's positive
[1:19:38.800 --> 1:19:45.040]  and everybody will gain from it and folks if we go into a depression you're going to need that food
[1:19:45.040 --> 1:19:52.320]  we'll be right back with mark corn he stay with us gold it's like nothing else on earth from the

[1:23:55.520 --> 1:24:01.280]  1-800-259-9231 mark you're bringing up so many great areas here but i want to
[1:24:03.520 --> 1:24:06.320]  i want to get your response to your analysis to this
[1:24:06.320 --> 1:24:13.760]  everything we talked about is now not just secret documents or witnesses or or
[1:24:14.480 --> 1:24:18.800]  movements we witnessed it's now in the john warren defense authorization act it's now in
[1:24:19.360 --> 1:24:25.200]  pdd-51 it says the governors the local police are all federalized the president is king he's over
[1:24:25.200 --> 1:24:31.600]  congress congress can't see the full pd-51 but the cover sheet says he's dictator and that means
[1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:39.120]  barack obama or whoever comes after him of course they're just puppets uh so the main
[1:24:39.120 --> 1:24:44.240]  military training with the marines of the army is to take on local police and take over city halls
[1:24:44.240 --> 1:24:48.720]  and the poor cops always take part in their own destruction we know most police will stand down
[1:24:48.720 --> 1:24:54.160]  and follow orders and do whatever they're told but i do see the enemy preparing as if they're
[1:24:54.160 --> 1:24:59.920]  gonna have governors and others resisting them uh why do you think that is well i think number
[1:24:59.920 --> 1:25:04.560]  one most important is there are the midweek hold the majority in many of the departments
[1:25:04.560 --> 1:25:09.360]  even the larger ones and this is something that they do realize uh they've acknowledged privately
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:14.640]  uh state the state forces although there are a few state police like the illinois highway
[1:25:14.640 --> 1:25:19.760]  patrol in and of itself is actually a unasset it's listed with you and by the way check that out
[1:25:20.400 --> 1:25:25.520]  uh michigan state police are in the same boat uh they were in knocking doctorated heavily in
[1:25:25.520 --> 1:25:31.280]  the 90s as a unasset but not all of them were cooperating something we couldn't talk about
[1:25:31.280 --> 1:25:36.160]  at the time and it's still true today we have people that are in management positions throughout
[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:42.240]  most of these departments that are in place to resist what's going on uh the other side realizes
[1:25:42.240 --> 1:25:46.720]  this the other problem they've got though is fewer and fewer regular americans are actually going
[1:25:46.720 --> 1:25:51.440]  into the uniform services that's why they're using the merc teams right now you're seeing the
[1:25:51.440 --> 1:25:56.720]  mercenary forces but remember those mercenary forces are to a degree made up of foreign assets
[1:25:56.720 --> 1:26:02.320]  again so now they're using uh felony illegal aliens now we do this 10 years ago now it's
[1:26:02.320 --> 1:26:07.600]  mainstream news yep and again tying that in with with what we're looking at uh there are two scenarios
[1:26:07.600 --> 1:26:13.280]  that actually the sliding scale scenario here does the emperor where gay bush the second the best
[1:26:13.280 --> 1:26:19.360]  president mexico has ever had uh want to continue to be emperor okay now if he does then we know
[1:26:19.360 --> 1:26:24.080]  that we could they can plug in a scenario very quickly with an overseas action first combined
[1:26:24.080 --> 1:26:30.320]  with a supposed attack here or sacrificing a capital ship in the persian gulf now they've
[1:26:30.320 --> 1:26:34.960]  pulled them out of the persian gulf supposedly but the basic old rule was never put a capital
[1:26:34.960 --> 1:26:40.080]  ship in the persian gulf because it will be sunk if a capital ship such as an aircraft carriers
[1:26:40.080 --> 1:26:45.680]  operational in the persian gulf it's it's superfluous it's unnecessary we have sufficient assets
[1:26:45.680 --> 1:26:50.320]  and the aircraft have sufficient resource and distance that there's no reason to put a ship
[1:26:50.320 --> 1:26:55.600]  like that in harm's way unless you're planning on sacrificing the crew remember the main that
[1:26:55.600 --> 1:27:01.600]  kind of thing anyway that option is all is in place however the more likely wicked response
[1:27:01.600 --> 1:27:06.960]  is something we've been warning people about for some time second step where gay bush best
[1:27:06.960 --> 1:27:13.440]  president mexico ever had and soon to be president of texalan you know a subsidiary of edland uh what
[1:27:13.440 --> 1:27:18.240]  happens is he goes back becomes the little emperor his little duchy once they divide the country up
[1:27:18.800 --> 1:27:23.920]  but in the meantime will send them a ding dong and the chipmunks uh slash hillary the hut combined
[1:27:23.920 --> 1:27:30.960]  with uh decide to come in and everybody goes oh change change small change change your underwear
[1:27:30.960 --> 1:27:36.160]  change your pants well and then the terrorist hit us and we learned to love barack he got tough

[1:27:41.280 --> 1:27:45.760]  scenario here's the thing even if they don't have the crisis i will remind everybody there was no
[1:27:45.760 --> 1:27:54.560]  crisis in 1993 when bush and clinton both executed waco and before that ruby ridge and what will
[1:27:54.560 --> 1:28:00.480]  happen again is everybody's going to think oh look peace love dope the liberals are in no no the

[1:34:02.400 --> 1:34:07.920]  18 year old guy weighed 250 pounds cornered me and i didn't have a choice and you know what that
[1:34:07.920 --> 1:34:12.880]  son of a bitch was going to the hospital five minutes later you know we don't have a choice we
[1:34:12.880 --> 1:34:19.760]  are gonna have to fight 110 percent and folks you're gonna realize that sooner rather than later some
[1:34:19.760 --> 1:34:25.680]  of you that are on the fence most of you know the cost and i mean commit don't go to the movies this

[1:34:45.440 --> 1:34:51.680]  loves to say we are having a great harvest right now everything we said's happening that's our great
[1:34:51.680 --> 1:34:56.400]  power that everything we talked about the old timers talked about 50 years ago 30 years ago 20
[1:34:56.400 --> 1:35:03.360]  years ago 10 years ago you know mark 18 years ago myself 13 years ago it's all now happen and we're
[1:35:03.360 --> 1:35:07.920]  telling you what the next step is because we read what carol quickly and the globalist and the rand
[1:35:07.920 --> 1:35:14.320]  corporation and the pentagon say and we have the sources and we have the moles to the point of we
[1:35:14.320 --> 1:35:18.560]  could tell you right before 9 11 happened i was on air saying look out something big is about to
[1:35:18.560 --> 1:35:22.880]  happen they probably hit the world trade center mark was on the air saying that william cooper was on
[1:35:22.880 --> 1:35:28.560]  the air saying that well we understand the enemy's operations we've watched them long enough and i'm
[1:35:28.560 --> 1:35:31.920]  telling you they're the most dangerous they've ever been because people say well what's going to
[1:35:31.920 --> 1:35:37.920]  happen now and i can say i don't know because they got four or five plans going at once they
[1:35:37.920 --> 1:35:42.160]  don't know what they're going to do there's internal splits inside the globalist for moles we have
[1:35:42.160 --> 1:35:49.280]  inside boulderberg that have been proven 100 accurate and uh so it means we're in more danger
[1:35:49.280 --> 1:35:55.760]  but it means when they move it's going to be that much more sloppy and hamfisted folks and remember
[1:35:55.760 --> 1:35:59.360]  you thought you could serve the system and be okay you thought you could sit out they're going to
[1:35:59.360 --> 1:36:03.520]  destroy your currency they're going to set up a greater police state they're going to feed on you
[1:36:03.520 --> 1:36:09.360]  going along with this is what will lead to your destruction fighting it is the only hope you have
[1:36:09.360 --> 1:36:15.120]  you don't have a choice mark corn to your take on that absolutely as a matter of fact real quick
[1:36:15.120 --> 1:36:19.200]  parole quick carol quickly do you remember when he was on cnn try and they were and they were
[1:36:19.200 --> 1:36:24.000]  asking war war you wrote this book and he he blurted out well they told me to
[1:36:26.240 --> 1:36:32.080]  and the point the poor guy was he was he was a cfr you know he was a he was a ring knocker cfr
[1:36:32.080 --> 1:36:38.400]  you know author his job was to write a tragedy and hope for the other side they never expected us
[1:36:38.400 --> 1:36:44.000]  i guess to read books and i have a copy i have an original copy of tragedy and hope with the
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:49.920]  dust jacket intact and it's one of many books that yes we've read in the other side by the way
[1:36:49.920 --> 1:36:56.000]  i was contracted to write that as their official historian uh for the british roundtable group
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:01.360]  the international uh you know real head of this thing the royal state of international affairs
[1:37:01.360 --> 1:37:07.040]  via cfr and i mean he said look i was contracted to write this go ahead mark right don't know he
[1:37:07.040 --> 1:37:10.480]  said don't blame me but they of course they were pointing at him and they were trying to attack
[1:37:10.480 --> 1:37:14.880]  their own and this is one of the things to remember you're dealing with a bunch of hacks
[1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:20.640]  who constantly are betraying each other that is why again what i said from the beginning
[1:37:20.640 --> 1:37:26.720]  here like earlier on building seven was supposed to die with the people in it not fall down hours
[1:37:26.720 --> 1:37:32.960]  later if it had a lot of people who are now breathing at this moment who can now think about
[1:37:32.960 --> 1:37:38.880]  what's going on are brought more into our camp because they realize they were supposed to be
[1:37:38.880 --> 1:37:44.240]  stunt dummies they were supposed to be meat puppets and victims and they weren't and the
[1:37:44.240 --> 1:37:49.120]  more people that that happens to the more realize that none of these characters can be trusted
[1:37:49.120 --> 1:37:53.920]  they are based upon deception that's the key to understanding the difference between working in
[1:37:53.920 --> 1:37:59.600]  the light and working in the shadow and darkness and we work in the light in fact remember we
[1:37:59.600 --> 1:38:04.640]  have given out the information the resources the data you people now people more and more people
[1:38:04.640 --> 1:38:08.720]  are plugging in but right now everybody listening you want to have some fun today you want to have
[1:38:08.720 --> 1:38:14.160]  some fun this weekend vote with your wallet in another little way reach into your pocket and
[1:38:14.160 --> 1:38:19.920]  see if you got a handful of change there if you get a dollar and twenty seven cents or a dollar
[1:38:19.920 --> 1:38:25.600]  and fifty cents vote with your wallet today go to the wally world go to your hardware go to your
[1:38:25.600 --> 1:38:32.560]  gun shop and buy one fifty round box of twenty two ammunition you know the other sides watching
[1:38:32.560 --> 1:38:37.200]  they are they're watching numbers they may not see you buy it but they see the numbers of what's
[1:38:37.200 --> 1:38:44.560]  moving the algorithm every round that we buy is another round that gets me an ak 74 an m4
[1:38:44.560 --> 1:38:48.640]  carbine or something else that the bad guys are caring because i'm going to make every round explain
[1:38:48.640 --> 1:38:53.360]  what a machete can do that's right mr. machete well actually my favorite a friend of mine who
[1:38:53.360 --> 1:38:58.480]  was in world war two used to use a one-pound ball peen hammer on german german centuries
[1:38:58.480 --> 1:39:03.360]  and he said mark it was probably the best tool i carried during the war when i had to silence
[1:39:03.360 --> 1:39:08.640]  people and i was trying to infiltrate well a machete works just as well and will cleave somebody
[1:39:08.640 --> 1:39:13.280]  quite nicely so that you get whatever they're carrying now we hope you'll be able to go farther
[1:39:13.280 --> 1:39:17.680]  than that because no you're right but a ball peen with one hit will knock them out at any
[1:39:17.680 --> 1:39:22.080]  percent of the time kill them with a full blow on the head it'll knock an elephant out and that's
[1:39:22.080 --> 1:39:26.480]  right a machete will only cut into the brain i agree that's better ball peen hammer now here's
[1:39:26.480 --> 1:39:31.040]  the thing we're not at the point where we have to use hand tools but we're going to use hand tools
[1:39:31.040 --> 1:39:36.320]  however we have to understand that we're one of the best armed populations on the planet now
[1:39:36.320 --> 1:39:41.360]  we may be we may be fat and decadent but we're made of the right stuff our ancestors were the
[1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:47.040]  best that's right it went in fact well what happened is that at both lexington and concord years ago
[1:39:47.040 --> 1:39:52.240]  everybody should remember the bad guys marched in remember they came in without fife and drum
[1:39:52.240 --> 1:39:57.360]  because they wanted to surprise the locals that was the whole reason that paul revere made his
[1:39:57.360 --> 1:40:03.280]  ride the british over and over again had been forted and had to try and leave covertly from
[1:40:03.280 --> 1:40:08.240]  boston well they did get to lexington but not before paul's boys had already ridden through
[1:40:08.240 --> 1:40:13.120]  and told them that the regulars were coming and they were going to stand their ground they were
[1:40:13.120 --> 1:40:17.760]  going to ship as a show of force and they were going to step aside well we know at some point
[1:40:17.760 --> 1:40:23.360]  somebody said you know what i've done this seven times because paul revere's ride was not once
[1:40:23.360 --> 1:40:28.000]  people forget this intentionally the other side's dumbed everybody down and it's it's not their fault
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:34.160]  because they burned the books well seven times they went out and more and said the regulars are
[1:40:34.160 --> 1:40:38.000]  coming everybody mobilized everybody got up and then the british had to turn around go back to
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:43.760]  boston this time around they didn't turn around on april 18th april 19th they kept going and at
[1:40:43.760 --> 1:40:49.520]  lexington one guy probably who was who was a french indian war veteran said you know what
[1:40:49.520 --> 1:40:56.080]  i'm really tired of this and he cast his ballot with a one ounce ball you know piece of lead
[1:40:56.080 --> 1:41:00.240]  that smacked a british soldier probably somewhere or maybe cracked over their head
[1:41:00.240 --> 1:41:05.040]  and then everybody cast a whole bunch of ballots back and forth in lead for a few minutes and
[1:41:05.040 --> 1:41:09.360]  eventually lexington militia obviously retired from the field ran because obviously they're
[1:41:09.360 --> 1:41:14.480]  outnumbered they went to concord and concord the british were so arrogant they kept track
[1:41:14.480 --> 1:41:18.960]  of what they were stealing from people's homes whenever i bring this up always remember the
[1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:24.000]  british are anal retinue control freaks when it comes to records their quartermaster recorded
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:27.760]  the candlesticks they were stealing the trunks of baggage you were going to carry away the whole
[1:41:27.760 --> 1:41:32.800]  nine yards and what happened is the concord militia stood outside of town and waited the
[1:41:32.800 --> 1:41:36.480]  act they didn't know what to do they weren't sure what should we start this war now we heard
[1:41:36.480 --> 1:41:41.440]  that lexington fought but we don't know how bad it was well then the acting militia showed up
[1:41:41.440 --> 1:41:46.720]  from another part another county walked all morning and got to concord the concord militia
[1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:51.520]  the act of militia standing there said what do we do well i know what to do so the acting commander
[1:41:51.520 --> 1:41:56.240]  he stepped up onto the road and formed his troops up called the fight and drum forward
[1:41:56.240 --> 1:42:01.040]  the volleys of the british soldiers guns were heard and he dropped dead but he started the war
[1:42:01.040 --> 1:42:07.680]  he changed the whole dynamics by saying move forward now from that point forward the british
[1:42:07.680 --> 1:42:13.200]  never took another step in advance they retreated all the way to boston during the boston siege
[1:42:13.200 --> 1:42:17.840]  we then have what everybody calls lexington well i'm forgive me have um we call it bunker hill but
[1:42:17.840 --> 1:42:24.960]  it was breeds hill dr warren a man who you don't find any of his writings in the shame on america
[1:42:24.960 --> 1:42:30.640]  because we let the ring knockers do this dr warren was a man who was a dynamic dynamo
[1:42:30.640 --> 1:42:36.480]  before the revolution he is a person who was who put his money where his mouth is when the time came
[1:42:36.480 --> 1:42:41.280]  he picked up a musket he went to breed hill many of the people there said you gotta leave we can't
[1:42:41.280 --> 1:42:45.360]  afford to lose you he said no i can't leave because i've i've said what i've said and i've got to do
[1:42:45.360 --> 1:42:50.960]  what i've got to do he was killed in the action and the british commander one of the british
[1:42:50.960 --> 1:42:56.640]  commander said after the action because the british took horrible casualties the one commander said
[1:42:56.640 --> 1:43:03.040]  even for the cost of all the men that we have lost it was worth it to kill what to know that warren
[1:43:03.040 --> 1:43:09.120]  died in this action that's how important the voice of people speaking was considered and still is
[1:43:09.120 --> 1:43:16.560]  today however we must be balanced we must be in both worlds we have to be in the ethereal world
[1:43:16.560 --> 1:43:21.200]  of the mind i've said this before and it's so critical we must be balanced and understand
[1:43:21.200 --> 1:43:26.240]  that it's not a silver bullet but rather a series of actions that are going to win this campaign
[1:43:26.240 --> 1:43:31.280]  win this war and it's going to be a long one kids because the real the real thing here alex
[1:43:31.280 --> 1:43:37.840]  the whole core of this is they want to steal our liberty for all the rest of the what they've said
[1:43:37.840 --> 1:43:43.600]  to steal our liberty yours mine your children's and they love talking to us like we're dumb
[1:43:43.600 --> 1:43:48.400]  animals saying the terrorist attacks you because they want your liberty and then they tell you
[1:43:48.400 --> 1:43:53.840]  who the terrorists are as they move heaven and earth to get the liberties and bush said i relish
[1:43:53.840 --> 1:43:59.280]  erasing the fourth amendment yesterday he said i relish signing this and he signed it and made
[1:43:59.280 --> 1:44:05.280]  an evil grin yep and again what what you're what we have to understand the people that we're facing
[1:44:05.280 --> 1:44:10.800]  are using the declaration of independence and our bill of rights as the checklist of destruction
[1:44:10.800 --> 1:44:19.280]  because what this is is a vendetta these are ring knocking spit swapping swine that we fought 230
[1:44:19.280 --> 1:44:24.880]  years ago think about it the men who said read down the declaration of independence and look at
[1:44:24.880 --> 1:44:29.040]  what we are seeing right now and tell me that that's not in fact take a yellow marker with your
[1:44:29.040 --> 1:44:34.560]  pocket constitution and go right through each step it's a checklist go through the bill of rights
[1:44:34.560 --> 1:44:40.160]  the original 10 articles they did not and it's also it's a right it's also a war against the
[1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:46.480]  magna carta remember that when tony blair got elected 96 he said my first mission this bbc
[1:44:46.480 --> 1:44:53.280]  headline is to abolish the magna carta which is the basis of our law so it's it again it's always
[1:44:53.280 --> 1:44:59.840]  that war against that that anglo-sex and common law exactly the liberty of our people is is really
[1:44:59.840 --> 1:45:04.800]  what this is about liberty is a gift from god if we understand that we're doing fine and it's the
[1:45:04.800 --> 1:45:10.080]  engine of wealth and the elite knows that yes and all of you out there listening every person
[1:45:10.080 --> 1:45:14.880]  every every man woman and child that right now is listening and those even who aren't
[1:45:14.880 --> 1:45:21.440]  aren't it is that the true nature of power is to cover it another man's time and to take it
[1:45:22.240 --> 1:45:29.040]  liberty explains in fact basically it's a gift from god liberty is your time as your property
[1:45:29.040 --> 1:45:36.240]  and possession nobody can give you more time and so with these evil wicked potlicking bottom
[1:45:36.240 --> 1:45:42.400]  feeders their idea is that by stealing your time they've gained power but here's the thing god gives
[1:45:42.400 --> 1:45:48.000]  only so much time to every person on this planet and they're dying of old age contrary to what
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:53.920]  they were told and they're dying as scabious clawing parasites that's what they're terrified of
[1:45:53.920 --> 1:46:00.640]  look at them let's take a look at the whole group look at their eyes scrambulous covered rates yes
[1:46:00.640 --> 1:46:06.080]  these characters are a sad pitiful group and they are going to go into the dustbin of history
[1:46:06.080 --> 1:46:11.360]  but scrabbling and reaching and wrenching the way they are their logic is if they can't have it
[1:46:11.360 --> 1:46:17.360]  they're going to kill it we'll take rockefeller 94 years old and still energize with wicked energy
[1:46:17.360 --> 1:46:22.160]  oh yeah but again not that he'll live he'll live forever i mean that's the one thing how many
[1:46:22.160 --> 1:46:28.400]  how many rockefeller's have we outlived guys think about it how many of his his his siblings
[1:46:28.960 --> 1:46:34.160]  are now gone or at least cousins all of them all his siblings are dead yeah so here we have him
[1:46:34.160 --> 1:46:38.880]  and then the only one that nobody talks about is j rockefeller and don't forget him because
[1:46:38.880 --> 1:46:44.160]  j rockefeller is in the wings and that's the next one coming up and he actually has been sitting in
[1:46:44.160 --> 1:46:50.720]  the shadows wanting to be a chief spider and would prefer that we not think about him but he is in
[1:46:50.720 --> 1:46:55.120]  the he's in the inventory there's another magazine ready to be cock locked and you know used in the
[1:46:55.120 --> 1:47:00.160]  rock and roll game here and that's what we've got to be prepared for is to identify the spiders
[1:47:00.160 --> 1:47:05.200]  in the wings yeah they use the executive letter opener to and they're to a degree they're getting
[1:47:05.200 --> 1:47:11.360]  tired of waiting for these others to die off and that's another element of what's creating confusion
[1:47:11.360 --> 1:47:17.120]  in the enemy's ranks because if they they don't want to release power it is actually what has hurt
[1:47:17.120 --> 1:47:23.840]  them and given us the ability to move to actually open the curtain remember what todo did todo wasn't
[1:47:23.840 --> 1:47:29.600]  very big but what did todo do todo grabbed that curtain dragged it off to the side and the great
[1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:35.280]  and powerful uh oh hey hey dog let go the curtain oh my goodness ignore the man behind the curtain
[1:47:36.160 --> 1:47:41.440]  too late well mark i think one of the biggest uh chinks in their armor we're gonna go calls
[1:47:42.400 --> 1:47:49.360]  is that any police officer listening can google or search uh government radiation testing on
[1:47:49.360 --> 1:47:54.400]  children and you'll find thousands and thousands murdered or government nerve gas us troops and
[1:47:54.400 --> 1:47:59.200]  killed them they can pull that up knowingly murdered them yeah and then ask yourselves okay
[1:47:59.200 --> 1:48:03.680]  they wouldn't carry out 9 11 oh that's too horrible but they'd nerve gas their troops
[1:48:04.320 --> 1:48:11.200]  and i mean you need to understand the minds of the globalist they relish they revel uh in in in
[1:48:11.200 --> 1:48:16.320]  killing people in the exercise of power and they did all those tests to create groups of people
[1:48:16.320 --> 1:48:20.560]  that would follow those orders and i'm going to tell you again you know in your gut you're part
[1:48:20.560 --> 1:48:25.520]  of an evil system and you know it's all coming to a head and you know everything we've told you
[1:48:25.520 --> 1:48:30.240]  is now happening and so you better choose sides you know bush said you're either with us you're
[1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:33.840]  with the terrorists you know two sides well they are the terrorists are you with the people
[1:48:34.400 --> 1:48:39.280]  or are you with those that like ravenous wolves come for our liberty scott in arizona you're on
[1:48:39.280 --> 1:48:47.520]  the air go ahead uh oh we know scott's there somewhere yeah scott are you gonna talk or
[1:48:47.520 --> 1:48:58.000]  not okay let's move on uh who's next there josh in california go ahead morning gentlemen um
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:04.240]  thank you very much for this it's it's been wonderful um i just had a couple of things
[1:49:04.240 --> 1:49:10.160]  that i'd like to offer and then get your reaction to them if that's okay go ahead all right um one
[1:49:10.160 --> 1:49:14.720]  thing you talked about is something called information advantage and that's the problem
[1:49:14.720 --> 1:49:19.440]  that we see within the government structure particularly with an intelligence uh people on
[1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:23.120]  the bottom like to maintain an information advantage so they can get promoted bureaucracies
[1:49:23.120 --> 1:49:28.480]  like to maintain an information advantage so that they can get more funding um and that's
[1:49:28.480 --> 1:49:32.000]  obviously one of their weaknesses and then the other thing that i wanted to share is a quote
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:37.200]  from the ram corporation and i'd like to hear what you think about that i'm pulling it out right now
[1:49:37.200 --> 1:49:45.760]  bear with me for one second please okay well uh mark you want to comment on that okay are you
[1:49:45.760 --> 1:49:51.280]  ready now go right ahead okay future conflicts will be fought more by networks than by hierarchies
[1:49:51.280 --> 1:49:56.720]  whoever masters the network will gain major advantages that's from john archia and david
[1:49:56.720 --> 1:50:01.360]  ron felt of the rand corporation and that's all i have to say and i just like to hear what
[1:50:01.360 --> 1:50:06.480]  you gentlemen think of that actually ran a good point here rand remember was uh one of the first
[1:50:06.480 --> 1:50:11.840]  before we had computers to have the get what they call the battle spheres they actually have a map
[1:50:11.840 --> 1:50:17.680]  a literal physical map of the world done is uh in a hydraulic form that could be turned and
[1:50:17.680 --> 1:50:22.240]  allow you to like god stand over a part of the globe and actually observe it now wasn't meant
[1:50:22.240 --> 1:50:29.440]  for everybody to use but the idea behind this was to help them visualize strategic trends uh as far
[1:50:29.440 --> 1:50:34.640]  as the networks go in a way we might call that say societies was to change the name to societies
[1:50:34.640 --> 1:50:39.760]  to understand the many elements that are manipulated in the past stay there mark let's come back and
[1:50:39.760 --> 1:50:44.720]  talk about that and get another response from josh and then others stay with us ladies and

[1:54:07.120 --> 1:54:11.280]  well you wanted to finish up with the ran corporation statement but after that anything you
[1:54:11.280 --> 1:54:15.920]  want to say to police military that are listening who may be ignorant of the fact we're telling them
[1:54:15.920 --> 1:54:22.160]  the truth well real quick here the rand again what they do is they they actually have been
[1:54:22.160 --> 1:54:28.800]  influential as we know for the last 40 plus years in creating the trend creating the mechanism
[1:54:28.800 --> 1:54:34.320]  trying to direct things to a degree but again one of the problems is that they're an intelligence
[1:54:34.320 --> 1:54:40.320]  collection system with you know specific flaws and part of it is isolation by the very nature of
[1:54:40.320 --> 1:54:45.360]  trying to create division within the population they create the same division and schism that
[1:54:45.360 --> 1:54:50.000]  affects their their decision processes which is why people wonder well how is it they if they're
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:54.640]  so powerful why haven't they grabbed well that's the whole thing they can't they depend upon this
[1:54:54.640 --> 1:54:59.920]  cloak and dagger system to try and manipulate people into the issue and that's what the global
[1:54:59.920 --> 1:55:06.000]  planning was about that's what the you know you're right they they they hoax us into making it a
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  social movement to pay carbon tax like we're getting at the man they know how to stampede us and
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:17.120]  hurt us that's right now don't know with regard to the the law enforcement and military personnel
[1:55:17.120 --> 1:55:20.480]  out there first of all there are many out there who are fully knowledgeable of what we're talking
[1:55:20.480 --> 1:55:25.920]  about that are talking about right now and they do understand what's happening and they're biting
[1:55:25.920 --> 1:55:30.720]  their time but for any of the other men out there i'd ask you take a look now again some have
[1:55:30.720 --> 1:55:34.480]  isolated themselves this is one of the problems of peace officers but the police officers who
[1:55:34.480 --> 1:55:39.760]  could should have been peace officers a lot are bitter and have isolated themselves because they
[1:55:39.760 --> 1:55:45.360]  have bought into a lot of this power freak bs now i'm going to ask you a basic question what did
[1:55:45.360 --> 1:55:52.320]  you get into uniform for in the first place guys be you a marine an airman an an a sailor or a
[1:55:52.320 --> 1:55:58.160]  soldier or if you are a police officer a sheriff's deputy or whatever you've seen good and bad police
[1:55:58.160 --> 1:56:03.920]  officers just as we've seen good and bad soldiers now you know the difference do you want to be
[1:56:03.920 --> 1:56:10.080]  remembered and perhaps stomp down by the rest of us for being stupid because to join the new world
[1:56:10.080 --> 1:56:14.480]  order click in the destruction of one of the greatest nations that has ever existed by dropping
[1:56:14.480 --> 1:56:21.040]  the borders by destroying the economy by helping to play police state in america do you want to
[1:56:21.040 --> 1:56:25.920]  be remembered when we eliminate that problem straighten everything up and you're on the out
[1:56:26.480 --> 1:56:30.960]  because that is the only attitude i have that that there is a mistake made by the other side
[1:56:30.960 --> 1:56:36.160]  it's the same arrogance the british had and that others have had before don't worry about the ones
[1:56:36.160 --> 1:56:42.640]  that are fat dumb and lazy there are a percentage out there but that's not us and there are tens of
[1:56:42.640 --> 1:56:48.480]  millions of americans are not only willing to fight but will fight have fight hard and win but but
[1:56:48.480 --> 1:56:53.760]  but that is important but not as important as the fact that they're going to keep pushing
[1:56:53.760 --> 1:56:57.920]  and force us to fight i want you understand something establishment those of you know
[1:56:57.920 --> 1:57:03.280]  lower echelons this isn't funny to laugh at anymore it's all coming true you're going to
[1:57:03.280 --> 1:57:08.320]  be forced into a fight with us and the enemy intends that we chew each other up don't they mark
[1:57:08.320 --> 1:57:13.280]  exactly the idea that the thought process of this we are not playing tit for tat we're not one thing
[1:57:13.280 --> 1:57:18.880]  about this when moose season opens up moose season means that there are a lot more of us moose hunters
[1:57:18.880 --> 1:57:23.440]  than there are mooses to go around and even if they bring in and they have brought in foreign
[1:57:23.440 --> 1:57:28.880]  forces they don't have enough of them to get the job done either but what they do hope to do is
[1:57:28.880 --> 1:57:35.280]  cripples enough that a one two three punch would possibly accomplish the mission well first of all
[1:57:35.280 --> 1:57:40.240]  speaking to our military personnel when somebody gives you an order to do something like try to
[1:57:40.240 --> 1:57:45.360]  level a city you turn you put the barrel to the guy's head you pull the trigger three times because
[1:57:45.360 --> 1:57:50.800]  you got to make sure you hit that pea brain between the ears but the bottom line is is that for all
[1:57:50.800 --> 1:57:56.240]  of you listening you're going to have to make significant decisions here to neutralize them
[1:57:56.240 --> 1:58:01.920]  as a threat and we're going to end up having to fight now we've got a lot of people out there

[2:00:38.160 --> 2:00:43.600]  dictatorship running things carrying out eugenics on us i wish they weren't doing all this i wish they
[2:00:43.600 --> 2:00:48.160]  weren't building prisons everywhere i wish they weren't destroying our borders and hiring felons
[2:00:48.160 --> 2:00:52.640]  in police departments of the military it's happening we tell you ten years ago they were
[2:00:52.640 --> 2:00:58.080]  hiring felons you laugh at us now it's in the news we've only got this segment part of the next
[2:00:58.080 --> 2:01:03.840]  to take your calls and mark cornkey let's uh go to james in illinois then daniel jason paul and
[2:01:03.840 --> 2:01:09.120]  steve and that's it for calls go ahead uh james yeah alex i'm uh jimmy kever i'm a union wireman
[2:01:09.120 --> 2:01:14.640]  here in chicago and a union lineman and i was working in new york in uh 2001 on the bear
[2:01:14.640 --> 2:01:20.320]  sterns building but at that time we had about 200 wireman down to the trade center in uh march and
[2:01:20.320 --> 2:01:24.480]  april of that you're doing a lot of uh they probably didn't know exactly what they're doing but if
[2:01:25.040 --> 2:01:31.120]  you're gonna wire a building to blow it in these office buildings the uh data rooms are all stacked
[2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:35.680]  one on top of each other so it would not be difficult to uh you know and uh that court looks
[2:01:35.680 --> 2:01:41.360]  a lot like cat five cable to or can you know it would be to do some construction work into thinking
[2:01:41.360 --> 2:01:45.040]  that they were doing something else when they actually weren't but uh thing i was calling you
[2:01:45.040 --> 2:01:50.240]  about is larry silverstein had just recently purchased the sears tower i read and uh you're
[2:01:50.240 --> 2:01:54.640]  talking about chicago and uh birds with feather tend to fly together you know and this guy's
[2:01:54.640 --> 2:01:58.080]  probably going to do the same thing over again so i've been telling everybody yes we keep saying
[2:01:58.080 --> 2:02:05.280]  chicago because a bunch of cfr people warren rudman gary hart and others keep saying mark my words
[2:02:05.280 --> 2:02:10.960]  dallis chicago denver cleveland they're all going to be hit my nukes they will be hit my nukes and
[2:02:10.960 --> 2:02:16.000]  then afterwards they love to show off and look like they're real smart just like they wrote memos
[2:02:17.040 --> 2:02:23.280]  and open letters before 9 11 saying it's either you know we're going to get hit in new york mark
[2:02:23.280 --> 2:02:28.160]  explain how they love to brag that that's a message to all the rather crime syndicate buddies that
[2:02:28.160 --> 2:02:33.760]  hey i'm in i'm on the inside two things to remember by the way real quick alex about chicago and for
[2:02:33.760 --> 2:02:39.600]  our friend here on the air watch the stockyards watch the rolling rail yards when you see them
[2:02:39.600 --> 2:02:44.640]  empty out that will be a warning and as it is there have been several points during key
[2:02:44.640 --> 2:02:50.560]  area era periods in the last year where the stockyards were literally empty which is unheard
[2:02:50.560 --> 2:02:57.120]  of because all rail leads to chicago right we we are a big hub and that's right and it's so
[2:02:57.120 --> 2:03:01.360]  that would be something again it's one of those many precursor indicators because if they're
[2:03:01.360 --> 2:03:06.960]  going to do an insurance job in fraga city they're going to move the stock out roll some junk in
[2:03:06.960 --> 2:03:12.240]  let that burn what little they want to sacrifice and then claim much larger on the insurance so
[2:03:12.240 --> 2:03:17.680]  to speak later on one other thing i noticed work picture new york was real bad for years and uh
[2:03:17.680 --> 2:03:22.000]  in 2001 they you know the books open up they start bringing guys in from all over the country to do
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:26.240]  jobs everywhere in that city exactly what no one real quick about the whole thing with decor
[2:03:26.240 --> 2:03:30.320]  remember that a lot of the wiring for demolition in that building would have to be conventional
[2:03:30.320 --> 2:03:35.760]  copper because you've got to get the signals simultaneously to different locations right
[2:03:35.760 --> 2:03:39.920]  so so to have the electricians running wire the way that they would and to have a large number in
[2:03:39.920 --> 2:03:45.760]  there that would make sense with again consistent demolition and destruction the final work would
[2:03:45.760 --> 2:03:51.200]  be done by more express professional but mark you know in a larger you know it's smaller but mark did
[2:03:51.200 --> 2:03:55.680]  you hear what he just said and i remember seeing this as well that was a union city you couldn't
[2:03:55.680 --> 2:03:59.440]  get foreign construction workers people outside the city and but they knew they were gonna eat a
[2:03:59.440 --> 2:04:04.240]  lot more so they opened it up the year before yep and they let people in that otherwise would not
[2:04:04.240 --> 2:04:10.000]  have been allowed on the floor to work or touch a wire would they i was working for the port authority
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:15.680]  myself on a job over in jersey on september 11th and they shipped us over start putting trailers
[2:04:15.680 --> 2:04:20.560]  together for them for temporary offices and i talked to a couple guys and uh i could swear i
[2:04:20.560 --> 2:04:25.520]  remember them telling me they came down off the 98th floor of the of the north tower and i thought
[2:04:25.520 --> 2:04:32.240]  nobody got off the uh above the strike out of the north tower so that's just been stuck in my head
[2:04:32.240 --> 2:04:36.480]  is how those guys get down you know amazing sir good to hear from you final segment with mark

[2:08:27.920 --> 2:08:33.680]  um you know we're coming into a very hard time this stuff like i recently graduated um for my
[2:08:33.680 --> 2:08:41.280]  government training camp and uh i gotta say i mean everything is just like so uh so well we got
[2:08:41.280 --> 2:08:46.320]  cameras everywhere like almost in the classroom you know you can see them there they're in most
[2:08:46.320 --> 2:08:52.080]  school bathrooms sir the police got blooded checkpoints it's all about humiliation all
[2:08:52.080 --> 2:08:57.360]  about setting the precedent not not only that but i mean we have so many cops compared to
[2:08:57.360 --> 2:09:01.440]  when i first started going there and not only that this year they're going to start making
[2:09:01.440 --> 2:09:06.640]  everyone wear id tag like like a little like a necklace well you know five years ago in
[2:09:06.640 --> 2:09:12.320]  aliziana the kids all just said no guys it's like everybody what it is is the school is not
[2:09:12.320 --> 2:09:17.360]  school it has become prison that's all that it is if you want to know what prison is you're
[2:09:17.360 --> 2:09:21.520]  seeing it in our school systems and that's conditioning everybody to literally you might
[2:09:21.520 --> 2:09:25.600]  as well just slap the chains on that's the next step if we don't even have a teacher who
[2:09:25.600 --> 2:09:30.320]  who i mean she really believed into the global warming you know swindle and she that's all
[2:09:30.320 --> 2:09:36.000]  an anti-human global tax fraud exactly that's what she she said she told me you know she told
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:41.120]  everybody in class she's like okay um guys you know i'm i'm really sorry to break it to you
[2:09:41.120 --> 2:09:45.680]  but to you guys but if if we don't turn this around with the global warming um humanity
[2:09:45.680 --> 2:09:51.120]  could be lost in like 50 years that's a little bold and then so humans are gonna have to die
[2:09:51.120 --> 2:09:56.800]  to save the earth it is total fraud and understand there's real environmental problems the globalists
[2:09:56.800 --> 2:10:01.440]  are systematically with the genetic cross species engineering destroying the global biosphere
[2:10:01.440 --> 2:10:06.480]  they're dumping toxic waste everywhere but then they'll give you something fake like what plants
[2:10:06.480 --> 2:10:12.480]  breathe like carbon dioxide when it's the sun that heats the earth and when in hot periods
[2:10:12.480 --> 2:10:17.760]  we can have a larger biomass mark corki well real quick on that well these people always tell you
[2:10:17.760 --> 2:10:21.600]  well i hate to tell you you know they're gonna have to get rid of people well how about her first
[2:10:22.320 --> 2:10:26.640]  you know what lead by example have her jump over the cliff and we'll watch oh that doesn't
[2:10:26.640 --> 2:10:29.760]  look very healthy i don't think i'm gonna do that alex i think we'll just stand and watch
[2:10:29.760 --> 2:10:35.040]  yeah they're a bunch of well-meaning mostly people are just well-meaning mindless idiots and
[2:10:35.040 --> 2:10:39.760]  that but they're just as dangerous these are robotic idiots but hypocrites in the process
[2:10:39.760 --> 2:10:44.240]  because they plan on you being the one sacrificed they're being told that they're the special pet
[2:10:44.240 --> 2:10:50.000]  puppies isn't that what the soviets did every step of the way absolutely mark uh i just know a lot
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:56.640]  of them are listening i'm going me what i i'm sorry i love humans but we must die i can admit i'm
[2:10:56.640 --> 2:11:03.040]  wrong i don't know okay let's go ahead i thank you for the call um daniel i mean jason let's talk to
[2:11:03.040 --> 2:11:11.760]  who's up next here jason in illinois uh you're on the air go ahead yes they uh a couple moments ago
[2:11:11.760 --> 2:11:16.800]  you guys talking about food supply and growing your own crops and uh i was looking into it and uh
[2:11:16.800 --> 2:11:21.360]  it only costs around five thousand dollars per person to get uh two-year food supply with
[2:11:21.360 --> 2:11:25.280]  water filters and first aid and burners everything you need i mean i mean i might
[2:11:25.280 --> 2:11:28.960]  sound like a lot of money to some people but i believe having a food and water supply is
[2:11:29.680 --> 2:11:34.400]  one of the like top three key things that you need to do to fight the n w o well i agree it's good
[2:11:34.400 --> 2:11:39.680]  to get a food supply and i'm about to talk about that but is it better to teach somebody how to
[2:11:39.680 --> 2:11:43.040]  fish or give them fish and i think everybody should have this horrible food as a backup
[2:11:43.040 --> 2:11:49.120]  but what mark's saying is the change in culture from being urban under their control to even in
[2:11:49.120 --> 2:11:55.200]  the urban areas starting a garden putting out some solar panels beginning to not be as dependent
[2:11:55.200 --> 2:12:00.000]  on them that way they can't just cut off the food and then make us all go turn our guns in and mark
[2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:04.800]  cornkey when i would listen to him 10 12 years ago and because i actually discovered mark after
[2:12:04.800 --> 2:12:09.040]  i got on air and i was like wow this guy's really got it figured out i mean he had it figured out
[2:12:09.040 --> 2:12:14.160]  totally back then i've been learning as we go along and i remember mark saying over and over again
[2:12:14.160 --> 2:12:17.760]  they're they're gonna train your kids to be rounded up at schools we have the documents and he had
[2:12:17.760 --> 2:12:24.000]  sources his dad of course was the sheriff's deputy uh they're in town uh and then he would go into uh
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:28.560]  how they're going to shut down the cities and make you bring your guns in to get your kids
[2:12:28.560 --> 2:12:31.760]  and then they did that in new orleans and other places where they're going to make you turn
[2:12:31.760 --> 2:12:36.560]  your guns in for food because they've done this in all these other nations mark well here again
[2:12:36.560 --> 2:12:40.400]  when he's talking about i thoroughly agree with food storage just like the alexa everybody's saying
[2:12:40.400 --> 2:12:45.520]  the same thing in the patriot movement but we have to have tiers of preparation uh food production

[2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  for this segment the next i've got uh i didn't plan it this way just happened this way because
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:08.080]  i'm trying to get mark all week and he called last night so they could do it today uh but we
[2:15:08.080 --> 2:15:12.160]  were just talking about food preparedness getting the storeable food and then then start learning
[2:15:12.160 --> 2:15:17.200]  as a supplement how to grow how to get ready now is the growth season there's a lot of things you
[2:15:17.200 --> 2:15:24.880]  can grow super easy folks watermelons pumpkins tomatoes all of those even in your backyard
[2:15:24.880 --> 2:15:29.680]  this makes the new order pull their hair out and the leading expert on all of this is steve
[2:15:29.680 --> 2:15:35.040]  shank j michael stevens group e-foodsdirect.com thanks for coming on with us steve it's good
[2:15:35.040 --> 2:15:39.360]  to be aboard elix and we were just for the last hour talking about getting ready the new world
[2:15:39.360 --> 2:15:44.400]  order is definitely moving against us and they're now saying get ready for food riots in the us
[2:15:44.400 --> 2:15:48.320]  i don't know if that's going to happen but i know this i better get prepared if the government's
[2:15:48.320 --> 2:15:53.440]  talking about it well you know the interesting thing is is that we've got another bailout coming
[2:15:53.440 --> 2:15:59.120]  which means that uh you heard about that this morning uh and they're going to bail out all
[2:15:59.120 --> 2:16:03.440]  these these homes which means they're going to just print more money which means that when you take
[2:16:03.440 --> 2:16:10.320]  your uh ten dollars to the grocery store it's going to buy less than it has in just the last
[2:16:10.320 --> 2:16:15.280]  week and a half which is already four hundred times more than what it cost last year to have
[2:16:15.280 --> 2:16:21.040]  groceries and that's what we're dealing with now i heard uh i was able to listen for a part of this
[2:16:21.040 --> 2:16:25.120]  one of your callers called in is that five thousand that doesn't take that much if you go with both
[2:16:25.120 --> 2:16:31.520]  foods but the fact is is that unless people take back control of their own destiny and that's their
[2:16:31.520 --> 2:16:38.880]  food they got a problem now what mark was bringing up is absolutely perfect you see you're not going
[2:16:38.880 --> 2:16:45.920]  to probably be able to put in enough storable food enough of this bulk food that we talk about at
[2:16:45.920 --> 2:16:51.520]  the foods direct dot com to get you through the whole thing because you got to get at least
[2:16:52.080 --> 2:16:56.480]  another three or four years this is going to take a little while for us to get back into control
[2:16:56.480 --> 2:17:05.120]  and you can you buy the the the the the storable food to deal with right now we're now telling people
[2:17:05.120 --> 2:17:10.480]  alex uh to start eating this because they're buying food at half last year's grocery prices
[2:17:11.040 --> 2:17:14.800]  as opposed to going down to the grocery store and people are running out of money
[2:17:15.360 --> 2:17:20.240]  it's just absolutely absurd that food banks i don't know if you're aware of it but the food
[2:17:20.240 --> 2:17:26.080]  banks that help the poor that have lost their jobs in this whole fiasco are are down to the
[2:17:26.080 --> 2:17:32.800]  point where they're getting half the donations you realize that the investors are buying up the
[2:17:32.800 --> 2:17:38.480]  food to the extent and selling it outside the country to the point by the way from michigan to
[2:17:38.480 --> 2:17:45.520]  california they're opening huge car parks from yuppies to live in their cars that's right absolutely
[2:17:45.520 --> 2:17:51.040]  and the thing is is that what's happening is that the investors are buying up the food so fast ahead
[2:17:51.040 --> 2:17:58.480]  of the american public uh even with our shortage situation that the food banks have have had all
[2:17:58.480 --> 2:18:06.400]  of their donations cut in half that means that when they get enough food in for fit to feed 50
[2:18:06.400 --> 2:18:14.240]  people they're going to have to stretch it to 150 people and that's it's not working and the fact
[2:18:14.240 --> 2:18:21.200]  there's no doubt we are in a deep deep deep uh recession going into uh hyper inflation and
[2:18:21.200 --> 2:18:25.680]  a depression if it continues and the federal reserve is making all the announcements as you
[2:18:25.680 --> 2:18:33.200]  said that will only intensify it absolutely and and what we're dealing with uh alex is the fact that
[2:18:34.960 --> 2:18:42.080]  i think that a lot of people now right now just to give you an idea the shipping on the uh the full
[2:18:42.080 --> 2:18:47.920]  the full one-year supplies and things we've got that down to two weeks we've put in some extra lines
[2:18:47.920 --> 2:18:54.240]  and things like that and so i know a lot of your listeners uh have have contacted some of the uh
[2:18:54.240 --> 2:18:59.520]  retail operations and they're back ordered three and four months and all this kind of stuff uh we've
[2:18:59.520 --> 2:19:04.400]  got it down to two weeks so anybody that needs to move on the food they're buying food at half
[2:19:04.400 --> 2:19:11.200]  the cost of last year's prices but uh also it's getting shipped out to them now one of the things
[2:19:11.200 --> 2:19:17.200]  that you have to be concerned about the criminal element is now involved it's all over the news
[2:19:17.200 --> 2:19:22.320]  there's like you said six months ago they're stealing food robbing stores stealing the metal
[2:19:22.320 --> 2:19:26.720]  out of the air conditioners frankly it's giant gangs of illegal aliens running around looting
[2:19:26.720 --> 2:19:31.840]  the idiot americans stay there steve shank we're gonna come right back eatfoodsdirect.com he's

[2:23:56.960 --> 2:24:03.920]  head was building collapse specialist it's a huge news dovetails them with the information
[2:24:03.920 --> 2:24:09.040]  kevin ryan was talking about a few weeks ago with us right now steve shank the head honcho the owner
[2:24:09.040 --> 2:24:12.560]  of the j michael stevens group longest continually operating swarble food company in the nation
[2:24:13.120 --> 2:24:18.480]  they have free audio cds dvds with his presentations you want to find out about what they do how to
[2:24:18.480 --> 2:24:24.960]  prepare food how to store food what the best types of food are and they have the very inexpensive
[2:24:24.960 --> 2:24:31.600]  high quality food that is not genetically modified in any way it is clean healthy good food continuing
[2:24:31.600 --> 2:24:36.080]  with the five minutes we've got left sir folks need to call you and need to get at least a two
[2:24:36.080 --> 2:24:42.640]  month getaway pack a one-year supply i mean this is just the most basic insurance yeah and the thing
[2:24:42.640 --> 2:24:47.520]  i was going to cover just before the break is the criminal element one of the concerns that i have
[2:24:47.520 --> 2:24:52.720]  is that people need to move on getting their food in their possession there will come a time very
[2:24:52.720 --> 2:24:57.920]  shortly and here's another one of those here there will come a time thing you said alex uh
[2:24:57.920 --> 2:25:03.920]  where even shipping by regular common carrier like we've been shipping out will not be safe
[2:25:03.920 --> 2:25:09.200]  because the food will be hijacked uh... there's absolutely no doubt as to as to whether that
[2:25:09.200 --> 2:25:14.160]  will happen and that happened in argentina in two thousand when they were a first world nation
[2:25:14.160 --> 2:25:20.880]  yeah i understand and uh... the main thing that we're dealing with is that the people have to
[2:25:20.880 --> 2:25:28.240]  realize that putting in the the food supplies getting this food in right now for a high percentage
[2:25:28.240 --> 2:25:33.440]  of our families what it means is them them being able to eat because they can't afford groceries and
[2:25:33.440 --> 2:25:40.800]  this stuff it is this food is going out at half of last year's grocery costs now you add that together
[2:25:40.800 --> 2:25:45.680]  with the fact that when people are putting in their supplies right now all they're doing is buying
[2:25:45.680 --> 2:25:50.800]  some time until they can get out of town or get a little piece of ground get their yard plowed up
[2:25:50.800 --> 2:25:55.760]  because you are going to have to start producing your own your own i'm glad that you brought that
[2:25:55.760 --> 2:26:00.720]  up alex because that's the next step now one thing that i need to announce is with every
[2:26:01.760 --> 2:26:08.400]  every shipment of food supplies we are sending out a dvd the things that we normally send out
[2:26:08.400 --> 2:26:13.440]  are the cd's and there's a lot more information than what we can possibly put into these packets
[2:26:13.440 --> 2:26:17.120]  for those of you that are calling into trying to get up on the website if you can but we're
[2:26:17.120 --> 2:26:25.200]  going to start putting out a dvd and a workbook basically that covers how you need to prepare
[2:26:25.200 --> 2:26:30.800]  for emergencies this is the evacuation route the stuff that you need in addition to having
[2:26:30.800 --> 2:26:35.200]  your supply of food in okay given your numbers steve a lot of people don't have computers
[2:26:35.200 --> 2:26:47.280]  okay call 800-409-5633-800-409-5633 and everybody that calls in from rogers uh program today and
[2:26:47.280 --> 2:26:51.520]  for the next week that's right you have roger freddenberg voicing your ass oh shoot yeah
[2:26:51.520 --> 2:26:58.000]  on rogers stuff on alex's program if you call in from that show let us know we'll make sure that
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:05.040]  you get this dvd and the emergency preparedness information right with your order give them
[2:27:05.040 --> 2:27:15.360]  your number again steve do 800-409-5633 or get up on efoodsdirect.com alex i appreciate you and
[2:27:15.360 --> 2:27:20.320]  you're doing some fabulous work keep mark corinke yelling that'll help well i mean when i'm trying
[2:27:20.320 --> 2:27:23.280]  to you know get out of the people is i don't know what's going to happen but they're talking about
[2:27:23.280 --> 2:27:28.000]  world war three with iran they're talking about food riots they're talking about i mean the
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:32.560]  mainstream media is saying all this i don't i hope it's not gonna happen i'm you know it's
[2:27:32.560 --> 2:27:36.320]  bad it stuff is i enjoy my life it's pretty comfortable here in austin and i don't want
[2:27:36.320 --> 2:27:41.360]  things to go to hell in a handbasket i don't want to be right but if we had 90 percent that were
[2:27:41.360 --> 2:27:51.040]  urban uh today and it was 85 90 percent that were rural 80 years ago during the great depression
[2:27:51.760 --> 2:27:56.320]  i mean do the math folks eight million people according to a big university study came out
[2:27:56.320 --> 2:28:01.040]  last month starved to death during the uh eight nine years of the great depression
[2:28:01.040 --> 2:28:07.200]  and that was with close to 90 percent being quote self-sufficient uh so if i mean if this
[2:28:07.200 --> 2:28:11.120]  kind of stuff happens now if there's any chance of an incident it's being openly discussed
[2:28:11.760 --> 2:28:16.080]  we're talking a breakdown of society which the bankers are planning then they'll come in an
[2:28:16.080 --> 2:28:21.680]  emergency reorganized society this could go on for five six seven years like steve saying that's
[2:28:21.680 --> 2:28:26.560]  what all the economists are saying and and then a year or two supply of food just doesn't cut it
[2:28:26.560 --> 2:28:31.600]  and i'm telling you i'm so busy doing talk radio i'm so busy talking on air thank god i've got
[2:28:32.480 --> 2:28:36.560]  family land i can run to but it's not really set up properly we're trying to fix the old water well

[2:34:04.400 --> 2:34:10.640]  police state attacking small children and women that is a light listening for the radio show
[2:34:12.320 --> 2:34:19.520]  you know it's a non-harriarchal group and i think it's just better if Rob Savoy
[2:34:20.240 --> 2:34:25.040]  who is prominent with the rainbow gathering and he's posted some videos of people being
[2:34:25.040 --> 2:34:30.720]  attacked for no reason and it made even some mainstream newspapers and in the area they
[2:34:30.720 --> 2:34:35.680]  reported that this group of people were out there and the police basically beat one person up so
[2:34:35.680 --> 2:34:41.600]  people yelled at them so they attacked them and uh it's i've seen a lot of other videos in past
[2:34:41.600 --> 2:34:46.800]  years where the police search every car that comes in of even media to cover it and searches the
[2:34:46.800 --> 2:34:51.920]  people coming in to the national park uh into the national forest area and so to tell you what the
[2:34:51.920 --> 2:34:57.840]  rainbow gathering is and the type of harassment they've been under uh is uh Rob Savoy and they
[2:34:57.840 --> 2:35:02.400]  have different classes of people that are in and he's one of the medical attendees and it has its
[2:35:02.400 --> 2:35:07.840]  own nomenclature and acronyms and so uh Rob Savoy will first fill us in on what the rainbow
[2:35:07.840 --> 2:35:14.960]  gathering is briefly and then what happened to them uh late last week into the weekend upsetting
[2:35:14.960 --> 2:35:22.000]  the establishment that people dare meet in the woods uh and uh i guess come in with nature
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:26.480]  they've left them alone somewhat in the past but now that's changing here in the new uh
[2:35:26.480 --> 2:35:32.880]  freedom that we uh live under Rob thanks for joining us
[2:35:32.880 --> 2:35:36.320]  again about the rainbow gathering about you and then about what you and others witnessed about
[2:35:36.320 --> 2:35:41.360]  the videos that you've seen uh that you got from some of the other members as multiple incidents
[2:35:41.360 --> 2:35:44.880]  took place out there i mean first tell us rainbow gathering where it is what it does
[2:35:44.880 --> 2:35:50.000]  you know where it's located sure and you can get a lot of information off my unofficial rainbow
[2:35:50.000 --> 2:35:55.600]  family website which is called welcomehome.org and it's got a lot of historical and legal
[2:35:55.600 --> 2:36:02.000]  and background information but briefly the rainbow family's been having our gathering since 1979
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:06.240]  we believe strongly in the constitutional right for peaceable assembly on public land
[2:36:06.240 --> 2:36:12.400]  and we exercise that right by gathering every summer since 1972 um the four services tried
[2:36:12.400 --> 2:36:18.000]  three times to make what we do constitutionally illegal by writing regulations making what we do
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:23.680]  illegal the prior two versions were thrown out in court in 1986 and 1988 the new version of these
[2:36:23.680 --> 2:36:30.400]  regulations which was an administrative change to the four service regulations came out in 1995
[2:36:30.400 --> 2:36:34.320]  and that in a sense made what we've been doing for all these years an illegal activity
[2:36:34.320 --> 2:36:40.400]  um once we became a quote illegal activity um the law enforcement harassment stepped up quite
[2:36:40.400 --> 2:36:45.760]  heavily leading to many years of complete roadblocks shutting down the rainbow gathering for three to
[2:36:45.760 --> 2:36:50.880]  five days on period we've had instances like two years ago in colorado where the law enforcement
[2:36:50.880 --> 2:36:55.520]  folks from the four service arrested all of the medical workers and banned them from doing medical
[2:36:55.520 --> 2:37:01.120]  care at gatherings and a whole series of events kind of culminating in this year where while they
[2:37:01.120 --> 2:37:05.920]  didn't set up a hard roadblock many of us wound up spending much time in court they passed out
[2:37:05.920 --> 2:37:11.760]  lots of tickets for things like dirty license plates and all sorts of stuff and there were
[2:37:11.760 --> 2:37:16.480]  several oh yeah you don't have an unregistered gathering of slaves pretty soon we'll be locked
[2:37:16.480 --> 2:37:21.680]  in our houses you don't have pit slaves out in nature by themselves without king's approval
[2:37:22.400 --> 2:37:26.880]  well basically yeah when you've got thousands of people sitting in the woods you know exercising
[2:37:26.880 --> 2:37:31.680]  their rights to gather peacefully on public land these people don't typically agree with the
[2:37:31.680 --> 2:37:36.800]  government status quo policies and a lot of others well we also have the government you know
[2:37:36.800 --> 2:37:41.840]  letting the borders be over run and all sorts of crime i mean but they don't care about that
[2:37:41.840 --> 2:37:48.240]  they only care about pit slaves uh would be yuppies who aren't yuppies uh who are outside
[2:37:48.240 --> 2:37:53.440]  their slave grids uh daring to believe that they can go on king's land without licking boots
[2:37:54.160 --> 2:37:58.320]  sure and and they keep forgetting that public land is owned by all of us not just the select group
[2:37:58.320 --> 2:38:02.800]  but it's not really owned by pit slaves they'll tell you that so as the slaves who've escaped
[2:38:02.800 --> 2:38:09.440]  their slave pit uh this angers the pit masters um yeah that's probably a way of putting it where
[2:38:09.440 --> 2:38:14.080]  we think that a lot of it is they just want to get control over it they can have consistently
[2:38:14.080 --> 2:38:18.560]  insisted that we become hierarchical that we start picking representatives that we start
[2:38:18.560 --> 2:38:22.960]  negotiating with the government they keep trying to get us to find permits and things with the
[2:38:22.960 --> 2:38:28.400]  government which we can't do nobody can represent the rainbow family just like even if i'm in a
[2:38:28.400 --> 2:38:33.120]  small town of people i can't represent the people in my town right i can't say oh go pave this road
[2:38:33.120 --> 2:38:38.000]  and do whatever you want but the government wants us to get organized they want us to pick leaders
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:43.680]  they want to use these leaders much like the bia to influence their control over us and typically
[2:38:43.680 --> 2:38:47.280]  we think that that once they get that control they would use it to basically shut down the
[2:38:47.280 --> 2:38:53.440]  factivity that we've been doing for all these years now tell us about where it's located where it
[2:38:53.440 --> 2:38:59.840]  takes place and and and generally how it works and then uh in a communal fashion and then what
[2:38:59.840 --> 2:39:05.440]  what happened uh oh friday and throughout the weekend with the ring rates yeah i mean typically
[2:39:05.440 --> 2:39:10.960]  there's a lot of rainbows um who spend couple of months in the spring looking for a fight um and
[2:39:10.960 --> 2:39:16.160]  this year big the site was going to be in wyoming we have a group of people a big council that is
[2:39:16.160 --> 2:39:19.920]  open to anybody that shows up at the last day of the gathering so this year we're in british
[2:39:19.920 --> 2:39:26.080]  national farce in wyoming last year arkansas the year before that um colorado and stuff and pretty
[2:39:26.080 --> 2:39:30.000]  much what happened is that some people find a site that they think is big enough they tell their
[2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:34.320]  friends their friends tell their friends it goes out and then suddenly thousands of people just
[2:39:34.320 --> 2:39:40.160]  kind of show up at the same time in the same place um there's no organization at all but there's a
[2:39:40.160 --> 2:39:44.880]  huge amount of coordination between like-minded individuals trying to do everything from a
[2:39:44.880 --> 2:39:49.200]  medical care like the folks that i hang out with and it really shows the establishment is powerless
[2:39:49.200 --> 2:39:53.440]  because you just show up they say you can't you do what you want and they grovel and suck their
[2:39:53.440 --> 2:39:57.840]  uh thumbs yeah and and basically they keep trying to shut us down but because we're a
[2:39:57.840 --> 2:40:02.480]  hardcore pacifist and peaceful people that don't carry weapons every time they've come in with
[2:40:02.480 --> 2:40:06.880]  all their guns i mean it's kind of like a a buck shoot i mean it's ridiculous now the
[2:40:06.880 --> 2:40:12.640]  paper reported that they did point guns at small children um tell us about this site this year
[2:40:12.640 --> 2:40:18.400]  looks gorgeous where you picked seven thousand people show up go over for us yeah and basically
[2:40:18.400 --> 2:40:22.640]  there are several instances that when they actually arrested people they typically tethered them
[2:40:22.640 --> 2:40:27.040]  between three to five times i have other video i'm working on getting out on the internet about
[2:40:27.040 --> 2:40:31.040]  this and so several people were tethered several people that were tethered also
[2:40:31.040 --> 2:40:35.200]  complained of being kicked um before being arrested and things like that well that's what
[2:40:35.200 --> 2:40:39.360]  a good slave gets that they're uh... yeah i mean they kind of beat you while you're down
[2:40:39.360 --> 2:40:43.920]  you know because it's a lot easier you're a good slave you're here to let boats body you exist
[2:40:43.920 --> 2:40:48.800]  for government you exist so people can stomp on you yeah so what happened that the incident
[2:40:48.800 --> 2:40:53.120]  that we're all talking about which was that there was an individual that the force service
[2:40:53.120 --> 2:40:58.880]  has spent several years trying to arrest and they found him um on the edge of the meadow near
[2:40:58.880 --> 2:41:03.040]  what we call kitty village which is where all the families with young children hang out and
[2:41:03.040 --> 2:41:08.080]  you know they do diapers and cook food for kids and all that and what happened is the police went
[2:41:08.080 --> 2:41:14.480]  to go arrest this one individual a another sister basically stood up and complained about the fact
[2:41:14.480 --> 2:41:19.360]  that they were standing around all the children they arrested her for obstructing a government
[2:41:19.360 --> 2:41:24.400]  operation then they arrested this other person named faunty for whatever it was that they were
[2:41:24.400 --> 2:41:29.520]  looking for him that and if people started to complain about them arresting people then
[2:41:29.520 --> 2:41:34.000]  um they start they draw all their guns they had pepper spray they had rubber bullets they had
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:38.240]  tear gas gun by the way we're showing video of this and running around aiming guns at people
[2:41:38.240 --> 2:41:43.280]  tasering people right now as we stream live yeah and if you look at the video you can very very
[2:41:43.280 --> 2:41:49.040]  clearly see that nobody is close by you can see that many older rainbows put their bodies in front
[2:41:49.040 --> 2:41:54.640]  of the crowded people and say peace peace everybody was trying to go away the force of it keeps
[2:41:54.640 --> 2:41:58.880]  claiming that there were ricks and sparks sticks and rocks but the problem is you've got all the
[2:41:58.880 --> 2:42:03.360]  videos and the newspapers admit they're a pack of liars as usual sure yeah and i only got the
[2:42:03.360 --> 2:42:07.360]  videos up on the internet last night so they're getting spread more around but we're streaming
[2:42:07.360 --> 2:42:11.440]  we're streaming a bunch of them as you talk right now because we're we're also on tv right now
[2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:15.760]  okay so you can see that the force service lied that there were no rocks thrown there were no
[2:42:15.760 --> 2:42:20.400]  sticks thrown the crowd actually never threatened the law enforcement officers but beyond calling
[2:42:20.400 --> 2:42:28.160]  them a god a god man to you to slide and then yeah and then basically you can very clearly
[2:42:28.160 --> 2:42:32.960]  see the front law enforcement officer shoot the people that were holding the crowd back
[2:42:32.960 --> 2:42:36.960]  they wanted to create a riot well that's good yeah that's what you do is you shoot peaceful
[2:42:36.960 --> 2:42:41.440]  people that's good yep so they shot all the peaceful people trying to keep the crowd back
[2:42:41.440 --> 2:42:46.400]  then as the those people fell then they opened up with tear gas good we treated probably
[2:42:46.400 --> 2:42:50.880]  several dozen people and our veterans fought against british tyranny was so you could live
[2:42:50.880 --> 2:42:54.480]  like this she could be attacked for no reason so i really think you ought to just shut up and
[2:42:54.480 --> 2:42:59.040]  stop complaining uh but please continue with your evil sir yeah and so we had a lot of
[2:42:59.040 --> 2:43:03.520]  incidents with several people were shot in the face including one as medic who almost died
[2:43:03.520 --> 2:43:08.640]  from being pepper sprayed in the face of the lord that is good i mean we basically in our medical
[2:43:08.640 --> 2:43:13.360]  unit we gave a marketing for over an hour until we recovered oh that's al-qaeda um many of the
[2:43:13.360 --> 2:43:18.080]  people that were shot with rubber bullets we treated in our medical unit and some people had bruises
[2:43:18.080 --> 2:43:23.920]  six inches across horrible you need a government license to put a band-aid on somebody how dare you
[2:43:23.920 --> 2:43:27.600]  oh yeah they basically were shooting people with rubber bullets from 10 feet away that's good
[2:43:27.600 --> 2:43:31.040]  that all of those people all the time that's good they need to kill you they need to feel
[2:43:31.040 --> 2:43:36.160]  good about themselves so all this happened around all the young children all the little kids well
[2:43:36.160 --> 2:43:41.440]  that's good watched all this basically go down so i'm gonna learn how to love their government
[2:43:41.440 --> 2:43:45.920]  yep and then the strange part was the government keeps going that they arrested instigators of
[2:43:45.920 --> 2:43:50.160]  the riot none of the people that they actually arrested was till the following day they came
[2:43:50.160 --> 2:43:55.520]  back the next day and just arrested a few people that they thought they remembered from the riot
[2:43:55.520 --> 2:43:59.440]  just so they could pretend that there was a real riot when there wasn't and it's very interesting
[2:43:59.440 --> 2:44:03.520]  because the force of this makes it sound like they came in and arrested the riot instigators
[2:44:03.520 --> 2:44:08.480]  but the reality is that they did not they can listen i'm coming out there i'm coming out there
[2:44:08.480 --> 2:44:13.600]  next year i am gonna go and i'm gonna be documenting i'm gonna have people hiding in the woods everywhere
[2:44:13.600 --> 2:44:19.040]  and we are gonna properly catch them with their pants down i'm gonna bring like i'm gonna bring
[2:44:19.040 --> 2:44:24.800]  like 10 camera people and we will really shut them down i don't know by the way rob you're going
[2:44:26.000 --> 2:44:28.800]  you're gonna be out there with thousands of hippies your favorite thing
[2:44:28.800 --> 2:44:35.920]  yep i'm joking we'll be in the next we'll be in the mexico next year so you know where to go
[2:44:36.720 --> 2:44:42.080]  you're gonna be where new mexico oh great new mexico's close to me yeah you're gonna be in
[2:44:42.080 --> 2:44:47.120]  high desert around ria dosa or something well you know nobody's actually started looking yet so
[2:44:47.120 --> 2:44:52.720]  we'll figure it out we are near trace ptrace and tal in 1995 the last time we were in new mexico
[2:44:52.720 --> 2:44:56.480]  i'll definitely be there that says all right please continue with your evil sir
[2:44:56.480 --> 2:45:02.080]  yeah so basically um you know the force service created a whole incident because they've been
[2:45:02.080 --> 2:45:06.880]  trying to shut us down for 37 years and failed and so now they're trying to portray it as a
[2:45:06.880 --> 2:45:11.280]  bunch of criminals and whatever else they don't seem to like and then they're using the fact
[2:45:11.280 --> 2:45:15.200]  that we're violent people i mean here we are peaceably praying for peace on the 4th of july
[2:45:15.200 --> 2:45:21.840]  which is all right and they try to portray us as violent criminals being being fired on but by
[2:45:21.840 --> 2:45:26.720]  by river bullets that kill people every few weeks i mean the red socks case shooting the younger on
[2:45:26.720 --> 2:45:31.760]  the face killer and it's all on video but but see i see all the squad car videos where they beat
[2:45:31.760 --> 2:45:38.480]  somebody up they don't fight back but they still charge you yeah i mean this is crazy why not just
[2:45:38.480 --> 2:45:43.840]  leave you alone well and well we don't know but basically as far as i can tell several years ago
[2:45:43.840 --> 2:45:48.080]  the head of the incident command team for the force service said that the reason they need to
[2:45:48.080 --> 2:45:54.960]  force us to get organized and basically elect a leader is so that we will pay a 750 000 dollar
[2:45:54.960 --> 2:46:04.000]  permit fee to the force service and of course they also want to be able to uh then restrict you
[2:46:04.000 --> 2:46:08.400]  and control you and prosecute individuals sure one of the things they said they're afraid of
[2:46:08.400 --> 2:46:12.720]  the spreading that's just living and being free again and doing what we want instead of licking
[2:46:12.720 --> 2:46:17.360]  their black boats well and and to be honest the rainbow family is about as free as it comes because
[2:46:17.360 --> 2:46:22.400]  we're even free from our own hierarchy you know much less anybody else's and i think that's the
[2:46:22.400 --> 2:46:26.560]  thing that bothers them that rainbow gatherings people are everything is free food is free medical
[2:46:26.560 --> 2:46:32.080]  care is free everything is free barter economy trading and people live pretty much under the
[2:46:32.080 --> 2:46:36.640]  radar and not really plugged into any of the kind of governmental system now they also try to quote
[2:46:36.640 --> 2:46:41.040]  go after drugs because let's just not lie there's a lot of mushrooms a lot of wacky tobacco
[2:46:41.840 --> 2:46:46.720]  floating around uh and and and but hey george washington smoked it i don't like it but that's
[2:46:46.720 --> 2:46:50.400]  fine with me they should decriminalize it this is the same criminal government trying to cram
[2:46:50.400 --> 2:46:55.440]  prozac and riddling down kids throats that kills them and deadly live cancer virus vaccines like
[2:46:55.440 --> 2:47:00.800]  h pv but they do set up their checkpoints they do try to nab people they don't have a very good
[2:47:00.800 --> 2:47:06.320]  record of catching anybody with the ganja do that well no because believe it or not a rainbow
[2:47:06.320 --> 2:47:10.560]  gathering the a lot a lot of the original input if with all the other ways of higher states of
[2:47:10.560 --> 2:47:14.400]  consciousness believe it or not drug use has never been part of what rainbow gatherings are about
[2:47:14.400 --> 2:47:18.320]  and while a lot of people that may come they gather to make believe this way because they
[2:47:18.320 --> 2:47:23.200]  gathering everybody's free to believe what they want you see these dichotomies you see many people
[2:47:23.200 --> 2:47:29.600]  that are healthy you know non-drug taking non-caffeine vegetarians watching video of them choking
[2:47:29.600 --> 2:47:37.360]  someone right now but this is some incredible footage right here so basically uh so basically
[2:47:37.360 --> 2:47:43.760]  as far as service people just torture and attack whoever they want and then and then and then
[2:47:43.760 --> 2:47:48.640]  just dance around laughing sure basically they did little things like when i drove into the rainbow
[2:47:48.640 --> 2:47:55.760]  gathering right for law enforcement vehicles and circled my truck on me on the road for gods for
[2:47:55.760 --> 2:48:03.520]  from mount olympus gods uh stop the slave now tell me slave what happened well basically then they
[2:48:03.520 --> 2:48:07.840]  you know complained about my vehicle because they know me because i have all these radio antennas
[2:48:07.840 --> 2:48:11.200]  on the roof because i do communications and gathering so they thought that was al-qaeda
[2:48:11.200 --> 2:48:15.280]  they thought that was evil yeah they got upset because i had more antennas than they did or so
[2:48:15.280 --> 2:48:20.080]  that the slave it doesn't have that that's illegal too okay well and and all the four service guys
[2:48:20.080 --> 2:48:24.800]  because of my long association know me really well and so they've isolated about a handful of us
[2:48:24.800 --> 2:48:29.440]  that they know really well and try to basically ruin our lives i've been a court like six or seven
[2:48:29.440 --> 2:48:34.640]  years in a row for gathering and all of my tickets have been dismissed all of them because they were
[2:48:34.640 --> 2:48:39.040]  bogus in the beginning the cops use this as an exchange to harass us they pull me over they spend
[2:48:39.040 --> 2:48:43.200]  two hours throwing all my stuff on the side of the road in the middle of the night and then they
[2:48:43.200 --> 2:48:47.200]  leave after bringing all the dogs over everything leaving you to put all your stuff back in your
[2:48:47.200 --> 2:48:51.920]  car and drive away this is how they greet you at the rainbow gathering yeah gotta not bring the
[2:48:51.920 --> 2:48:57.280]  ganja yeah well yeah and i don't anyway i'm a medic i just bring add to it no i understand that's
[2:48:57.280 --> 2:49:01.840]  it's good good thing for you yeah but it's just ridiculous and they search everybody like that
[2:49:01.840 --> 2:49:06.960]  families with kids everything and when i was in court almost every case there was for stupid
[2:49:06.960 --> 2:49:12.960]  things like 30 license plates you know bright brake lights not visible enough i mean the most
[2:49:12.960 --> 2:49:17.600]  incredibly trivial traffic charges this is the heart biggest stuff that these guys could get us
[2:49:17.600 --> 2:49:22.480]  for was a whole bunch of meaningless traffic now what about pointing guns at children the newspaper
[2:49:22.480 --> 2:49:27.840]  said they'd seen videos of that yeah some of the other videos not the ones on my website but some
[2:49:27.840 --> 2:49:32.560]  of the other videos actually show them they're basically spanning the crowd with their guns
[2:49:32.560 --> 2:49:37.680]  and they were standing you know 15 feet from the kid village area the big kitchen why are they so
[2:49:37.680 --> 2:49:42.480]  afraid i mean as a man i don't plan to be a real tough guy but i mean i really don't get scared
[2:49:42.480 --> 2:49:46.960]  very easily and i've had people threaten me and all sorts of stuff when i'm out unarmed and it's
[2:49:46.960 --> 2:49:51.600]  actually kind of a thrill i don't get why cops have been they used to be like this cops used to be
[2:49:51.600 --> 2:49:57.680]  pretty tough uh i mean i had a lot of you know cops in my family and they're you know pretty tough
[2:49:57.680 --> 2:50:01.280]  and in the old days they were pretty tough if they were into you know being macho and not being
[2:50:01.280 --> 2:50:06.640]  wimps now cops are so afraid of everything they're just like uh with guns at people's heads
[2:50:06.640 --> 2:50:14.560]  yeah oh my god oh my god they're deadly yeah it's it's kind of amusing because like to be honest
[2:50:14.560 --> 2:50:18.560]  you know i've been in situations where i've been surrounded by cops and i'm not usually that scared
[2:50:18.560 --> 2:50:24.640]  but you know these guys with full armor and weapons are scared of a few hundred people that they know
[2:50:24.640 --> 2:50:29.680]  from our track record for 37 years our people aren't gonna attack anybody this is completely
[2:50:29.680 --> 2:50:36.880]  ridiculous the wicked flea when none pursuers the wicked flea when none pursuers start say with us

[2:54:38.880 --> 2:54:44.400]  the altercation that happened in kid village i kind of saw it from a distance on uh you know i did
[2:54:44.400 --> 2:54:50.080]  witness uh unprovoked firing of what would appear to be uh paintball pepper spray into
[2:54:50.080 --> 2:54:56.400]  proud to take children but that's what slaves are for is to be fired on by gods i mean you know
[2:54:56.400 --> 2:55:00.720]  the great tragedies with zoos wanted to come down and kill a mortal he did it for his enjoyment
[2:55:01.840 --> 2:55:05.360]  right we're not going out there to be in a tragedy alex we're uh going out there to pray
[2:55:07.040 --> 2:55:12.080]  well i'm being sarcastic about the tyranny that we have in this land by by throwing it in their
[2:55:12.080 --> 2:55:16.160]  face but but yet certainly it's horrible shooting rubber bullets at children uh tell me what else
[2:55:16.160 --> 2:55:26.880]  you saw um you know just generally like i said that the the use of the of the left lethal weaponry
[2:55:26.880 --> 2:55:33.040]  um it wasn't it wasn't provoked any i've i've read in the paper uh you know that sticks and rocks
[2:55:33.040 --> 2:55:37.200]  were thrown i've read that you know every couple of years for the past eight years um there was
[2:55:37.200 --> 2:55:42.560]  nothing thrown uh the couple of people that were you know in in biking there's either a little bit
[2:55:42.560 --> 2:55:46.160]  too belligerent not violent a little bit too belligerent we're uh we're held back and dealt
[2:55:46.160 --> 2:55:52.640]  with by bystanders um the police officers are not in any danger at any time and there's video of
[2:55:52.640 --> 2:55:58.560]  that and then we know they're lying uh and and this is this is why they've been disgraced and this
[2:55:58.560 --> 2:56:03.120]  is why this country's in so much trouble that's why i'm going to go out there to do in mexico
[2:56:03.120 --> 2:56:08.160]  next year and my people spread out so whenever they attack we'll always catch it and just to
[2:56:08.160 --> 2:56:13.440]  again illustrate that they're a pack of liars what else did you witness well and you know
[2:56:14.000 --> 2:56:18.560]  not a lot involved with that altercation but you know i've been doing this for eight years now
[2:56:18.560 --> 2:56:24.240]  and uh just the general police abuse you know i mean setting up what they call information
[2:56:24.240 --> 2:56:29.360]  checkpoints so that they can search every car that comes through um coming in with troops of
[2:56:29.360 --> 2:56:35.280]  you know eight to fourteen armed men to fish for arrests you know we're talking about about
[2:56:35.280 --> 2:56:40.880]  misdemeanor and and very low-level misdemeanor warrants that are being held early how early
[2:56:40.880 --> 2:56:45.600]  does this start as the rainbow or start trickling in the week before right i mean how how early
[2:56:45.600 --> 2:56:52.400]  do they bivouac and nest on the road searching and harassing uh everybody oh it usually starts
[2:56:52.400 --> 2:57:00.720]  up between uh the twelfth and maybe sixteenth of june when you know there's less than a thousand
[2:57:00.720 --> 2:57:06.880]  people on the land as a matter of fact that their ammo has been traditionally to attack the people
[2:57:06.880 --> 2:57:12.080]  who are volunteering the most time so they attack supply lines they attack they uh they they harass
[2:57:12.080 --> 2:57:16.960]  our medical personnel um you know they they harass the scouts and the people that are operating
[2:57:16.960 --> 2:57:21.600]  communications they attack america that's their main mission is freedom yeah and the terrorist
[2:57:21.600 --> 2:57:24.880]  has before a freedom what they're doing now is they're they're kind of you know cutting your
[2:57:24.880 --> 2:57:29.920]  own throat as far as problems go because they're taking their they're taking action against the
[2:57:29.920 --> 2:57:34.560]  people who are most likely to deal with real what problems you understand that's what they want
[2:57:34.560 --> 2:57:41.040]  they want to rule they got the job because they want to shove slaves around right and i yeah
[2:57:41.040 --> 2:57:45.680]  that's why they don't like it because we're not really slaves exactly you're the opposite of slaves
[2:57:45.680 --> 2:57:50.400]  and you've got to be punished you're not staying in line uh i want to hear about the history of
[2:57:50.400 --> 2:57:56.000]  the rainbow gathering we get back with both scott and our other guest rob uh rob did you
[2:57:56.000 --> 2:58:00.320]  witness some of the things that we hear scott talking about oh yeah they've been harassing
[2:58:00.320 --> 2:58:04.720]  us like he said for seven or eight years um it goes back even farther than that but it's
[2:58:04.720 --> 2:58:09.360]  obvious that pretty much everybody goes through that certain amount of law enforcement harassment
[2:58:09.360 --> 2:58:13.520]  getting into a gathering i mean here we are exercising our constitutional rights to peaceably
[2:58:13.520 --> 2:58:20.000]  assemble on public land and they make us all like dump our stuff out search our cars and scare everybody

[3:00:42.640 --> 3:00:48.880]  us the the the howl the rainbow gathering started and now grew up to what more than 7 000 people
[3:00:50.720 --> 3:00:55.520]  um you know basically what happened was um a lot of people were influenced by the whole kind of
[3:00:55.520 --> 3:01:00.240]  woodstock thing when it happened the fact that thousands of people could get together communally
[3:01:00.240 --> 3:01:05.280]  take care of each other and have like no real problems and violence and that inspired a whole
[3:01:05.280 --> 3:01:10.560]  bunch of people to create another small series of music festivals specifically called vortex one
[3:01:10.560 --> 3:01:16.320]  and vortex two and what happened was from by the end of vortex two there is a big shift that
[3:01:16.320 --> 3:01:20.480]  everybody realized that everything should be free the commercial music festivals were bad
[3:01:20.480 --> 3:01:25.840]  and they kind of came up with the idea of the sort of rainbow gathering of the tribes all the different
[3:01:25.840 --> 3:01:34.080]  sort of counter cultural folks doing whatever um and so in 1972 the first rainbow gathering was held
[3:01:34.080 --> 3:01:38.160]  um in grandby colorado um there was originally going to be held at a place called big table
[3:01:38.160 --> 3:01:43.360]  rock mountain and the force service came in with the national guard and police and everybody and
[3:01:43.360 --> 3:01:49.200]  shut the fight down and forced everybody to the army's for it's to keep slaves off the public land
[3:01:49.200 --> 3:01:54.560]  it's to let you know that you're scum yeah so the very first gathering everybody had to move
[3:01:54.560 --> 3:02:00.000]  seven miles away to a place called strawberry lake which was some private property um basically
[3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:04.320]  you know donated by a ranger and then on the evening of july so there was a nice ranger who
[3:02:04.320 --> 3:02:08.560]  felt bad about the tyranny yeah and then the funny part is on the evening of july third everybody
[3:02:08.560 --> 3:02:13.440]  packed up camp and in the all night long there was a seven mile hike on this old train track
[3:02:13.440 --> 3:02:18.160]  and when everybody got up in the morning of july fourth which is our kind of big day um there were
[3:02:18.160 --> 3:02:21.680]  thousands of people standing on top of the mountain that nobody was supposed to be to that had walked
[3:02:21.680 --> 3:02:26.720]  completely around the roadblock and to be clear they attacked last week on friday on july fourth
[3:02:26.720 --> 3:02:32.160]  they understand the symbolicness of it got to attack on july fourth uh so so so you guys you
[3:02:32.160 --> 3:02:37.920]  just rebelled against them on july fourth back in the seventies uh yeah basically oh that sounds
[3:02:37.920 --> 3:02:42.720]  evil uh rebelling on july fourth oh my god well and then it was classic rainbow because it was
[3:02:42.720 --> 3:02:46.400]  kind of passive resistance right well they fatted there at their little roadblock everybody just
[3:02:46.400 --> 3:02:52.320]  walked around them and so funny enough just set off a 37 year history of you know law enforcement
[3:02:52.320 --> 3:02:57.600]  and uh rainbow gatherings and stuff um the first event was supposed to be kind of a one-time only
[3:02:57.600 --> 3:03:02.080]  thing but what happened was the next year some of the folks who had organized the first gathering
[3:03:02.080 --> 3:03:06.000]  got this funny phone call from the Forest Service they said hey there's just like rainbow gathering
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:14.240]  here in Wyoming 1973 and it has to go to a better site and so um some folks showed up found a
[3:03:14.240 --> 3:03:18.640]  slightly better site you know it was better healthier and stuff and had the gathering there
[3:03:18.640 --> 3:03:23.360]  and then the next year it was in utah and this whole thing it kind of became a self-organizing
[3:03:24.000 --> 3:03:29.680]  event people just found sites and announced it every year and it's kind of grown since then
[3:03:29.680 --> 3:03:35.280]  and both 86 and 87 the government tried to create law that would make you know
[3:03:35.280 --> 3:03:40.720]  peaceful assembling on public land illegal both of those were determined unconstitutional
[3:03:40.720 --> 3:03:46.080]  and in 1988 it was actually thrown out because the cops were so bad that um the harassment
[3:03:46.080 --> 3:03:50.080]  and stuff the judge there couldn't find any way to convict them but court rulings mean nothing
[3:03:50.720 --> 3:03:57.360]  the tyranny continues anything you want to add scott to continue from there court ruling
[3:03:57.360 --> 3:04:04.400]  rulings because on three different occasions since the 80s um when we won federal court cases to
[3:04:05.520 --> 3:04:09.120]  tie their hands up to how they're trying to keep this gathering from happening we're not even
[3:04:09.120 --> 3:04:14.560]  talking about the abuses just them saying this can't happen um we won three court cases every
[3:04:14.560 --> 3:04:20.800]  time we win a court case the the Forest Service the USDA rewrite the laws in the letter but not in
[3:04:20.800 --> 3:04:26.960]  the not in the spirit of the law of course we go back to court again now in colorado 2000

[3:08:28.320 --> 3:08:39.120]  yes i had heard recently that there's another one of these gatherings that's taking place
[3:08:39.120 --> 3:08:43.360]  in california right now except it's on private land and i heard there's some illicit activity
[3:08:43.360 --> 3:08:48.400]  it's called bohemian growth i didn't know if you wanted to talk about that at all and um well
[3:08:48.400 --> 3:08:55.280]  that is rich republicans having gay sex so that is that is that is left alone and guarded
[3:08:55.280 --> 3:09:00.800]  by a local sheriff and the secret service uh if you know do you think there's any way that you
[3:09:00.800 --> 3:09:05.200]  could uh the people out in california could maybe call in some complaints and say that they had
[3:09:05.200 --> 3:09:09.520]  heard of uh illicit activity taking place and they could maybe set up some of these uh enforcement
[3:09:09.520 --> 3:09:14.240]  checkpoints you mean repeatedly they find uh you mean polyclots and repeatedly finding dead
[3:09:14.240 --> 3:09:20.160]  bodies of small children outside the grove uh well no that's that's not uh you know dead children
[3:09:20.160 --> 3:09:25.120]  and and and gay porn stars flying in for them that's that's that's that's that's that's of the lord
[3:09:25.120 --> 3:09:30.960]  according to them and uh yeah um and also just in a more serious note i was wondering if you
[3:09:30.960 --> 3:09:35.280]  think there's any way that we can use the the establishment's weapons against them things like
[3:09:35.280 --> 3:09:40.640]  the patriot act and all these other no it's all selectively enforced it's all run by the criminal
[3:09:40.640 --> 3:09:45.520]  drug dealing uh weapons selling new world order people and it's all for us the cattle but we'll
[3:09:45.520 --> 3:09:51.040]  just continue to discredit them expose them show their terrorist and we're very close now that's
[3:09:51.040 --> 3:09:55.520]  why they're very desperate to stage more terror attacks or who knows what uh thank you so much
[3:09:56.240 --> 3:10:01.680]  for the call lance chandy in chicago you're on the air with some of the rainbow gathering folks
[3:10:02.480 --> 3:10:07.600]  uh yes i'm about uh five miles north of the sears tower and recently there've been those black
[3:10:07.600 --> 3:10:12.800]  military um helicopters flying around downtown really low between the buildings around the sears
[3:10:12.800 --> 3:10:16.640]  tower that's the act like they're trying to keep you safe they think they're fighting real
[3:10:16.640 --> 3:10:21.440]  terrorists not knowing the government carried out the attacks we've also had um our subway
[3:10:21.440 --> 3:10:28.480]  shutdown uh repeatedly for quote unquote health emergencies but um and lots of like cops uh
[3:10:29.440 --> 3:10:35.200]  paramedics and whatnot um swarming down around they're doing biological spraying of their
[3:10:35.200 --> 3:10:42.160]  minions constantly the police are there to to be tested on and used and abused and they smile
[3:10:42.160 --> 3:10:47.920]  and love every minute of it they have killed cops military thousands of times uh tested on them
[3:10:47.920 --> 3:10:52.880]  made them sick thousands of times all declassified and they just they love it that they just love it
[3:10:55.040 --> 3:11:00.320]  my whole concern is like um a previous caller today said that larry silverscene at purchase
[3:11:00.320 --> 3:11:04.080]  that this year's tower that's right and he might blow it up right in front of you and everybody
[3:11:04.080 --> 3:11:08.720]  will love it and i've been trying to find that on the internet and it just comes out it was in
[3:11:08.720 --> 3:11:13.440]  the chicago tribune he bought it two years ago i just didn't want to correct the caller it happened
[3:11:13.440 --> 3:11:18.400]  two years ago he said recently but that's not that recent oh okay in any case so i was just
[3:11:18.400 --> 3:11:24.560]  wondering if on your website or if you can mention like sort of like uh an immediate uh warning
[3:11:24.560 --> 3:11:29.200]  signs i guess that citizens like myself who travel in and out of the loop occasionally um
[3:11:29.200 --> 3:11:33.840]  you know what to look for you know for like uh some sort of because you mentioned like new
[3:11:33.840 --> 3:11:38.080]  new king chicago like what we can look out for well that's because globalists like to brag
[3:11:38.080 --> 3:11:42.800]  they've they've said that lci ado will probably hit chicago they loved it and they smile and
[3:11:42.800 --> 3:11:46.800]  it's a public thread everybody in the know which is most the planet knows oh look the terrorist
[3:11:46.800 --> 3:11:52.080]  is bragging only the brainwashed americans don't understand the message i mean gary hart said we
[3:11:52.080 --> 3:11:56.640]  stage terror attacks i mean publicly we went and talked to him he said yeah we stage terror attacks
[3:11:56.640 --> 3:12:00.880]  and it's like that's the way it is shut up i appreciate your call but i mean as for not being
[3:12:00.880 --> 3:12:15.120]  able to find on the internet watch this larry silvers teen sears tower okay and i typed it in
[3:12:16.400 --> 3:12:22.720]  and uh met life will sell sears tower wall street journal top story real estate journal
[3:12:23.440 --> 3:12:27.200]  so people always tell me they can't find this stuff and i don't understand it larry silvers
[3:12:27.200 --> 3:12:35.120]  teen sears tower okay and i clicked it and uh this is intermediate internet it's not loading
[3:12:35.120 --> 3:12:39.120]  but it it it will i'll be able to reach the headline but there was a score of mainstream
[3:12:39.120 --> 3:12:44.640]  articles about it and uh you can uh read it and it has the headline there for you met life will
[3:12:44.640 --> 3:12:49.440]  sell sears tower uh it says investors larry silvers teen group that owns the world trade

[3:12:54.080 --> 3:12:58.480]  for more than 800 million dollars according to people familiar with the situation and this was
[3:12:58.480 --> 3:13:05.760]  more than two years ago i'm i'm sorry i was time flies this was march 12 2004 he bought it in uh
[3:13:06.560 --> 3:13:13.840]  the sale was complete early 2005 so that is uh three plus years ago okay so uh does that answer
[3:13:13.840 --> 3:13:20.160]  question good okay going back to the rainbow gathering folks let's take another call for him
[3:13:20.160 --> 3:13:27.360]  and uh see if uh they uh have anything to say uh bill bill were you calling from you're on the air
[3:13:28.080 --> 3:13:33.280]  hey alex i'm in sharon indiana and uh i wondered if i could speak about something
[3:13:33.280 --> 3:13:40.720]  at the bit off topic and what you're on today sure go ahead bill yeah um well i've been doing some
[3:13:40.720 --> 3:13:46.720]  research of my own and uh i'm so i'm so happy with what you're doing and with regard to end game and
[3:13:46.720 --> 3:13:52.880]  and uh the the loose change product and so on um and i've noticed there seems to be a bit of a
[3:13:52.880 --> 3:13:58.640]  disconnect i'm a christian there's a bit of a disconnect between some of our uh analysis of
[3:13:58.640 --> 3:14:04.560]  culture and the ability for us to come to the conclusion that there really are conspirators
[3:14:04.560 --> 3:14:09.600]  it seems i don't know what the problem is uh anytime i bring any kind of the stuff up
[3:14:10.240 --> 3:14:16.480]  it seems like well we're just fighting ideologies but there's no personality behind them uh
[3:14:16.480 --> 3:14:20.960]  do you understand what i'm talking about no i don't i don't understand well like like uh you
[3:14:20.960 --> 3:14:26.960]  know the philosophy of totalitarianism and how these things come come into be uh come into existence
[3:14:27.840 --> 3:14:34.640]  and uh and then and then a lot of christians act as if there's no personality behind them or
[3:14:35.200 --> 3:14:39.840]  maybe there's some kind i have to say no no no no they've been taught by preachers the whole
[3:14:39.840 --> 3:14:43.920]  church and every other major religion's been taken over by the globalist they fund it through
[3:14:43.920 --> 3:14:48.800]  federal funds world council of churches and so they tell them you're to worship government and do
[3:14:48.800 --> 3:14:54.880]  whatever it says right and and so that's why uh they're like that they just want to feel good
[3:14:55.520 --> 3:15:01.600]  go to church go go go on vacation and just not worry about the world right now have you have
[3:15:01.600 --> 3:15:07.760]  you read the uh there's a book called the idols for destruction by uh by herbert schlossberg
[3:15:07.760 --> 3:15:14.800]  or no and the sub the subtitle is uh christianity and its conflict with american society and that
[3:15:14.800 --> 3:15:21.600]  was kind of a stepping stone for me uh in in tackling a huge amount of these issues um
[3:15:21.600 --> 3:15:26.480]  i'm completely ignorant with regard to the the economic uh in the monetary system with the
[3:15:26.480 --> 3:15:30.720]  federal banks and and and uh him talk well the the private banks we should call them
[3:15:31.280 --> 3:15:36.640]  but him talking about how they monetize the debt and so forth but if if christians are
[3:15:36.640 --> 3:15:41.520]  are unaware that's a good uh stepping well they i mean they want to be unaware and i appreciate
[3:15:41.520 --> 3:15:47.120]  your call they want to be slaves they want to believe lies and uh just like the liberals
[3:15:47.120 --> 3:15:51.120]  do the liberals think barack obama is going to save him he'll he will continue all the
[3:15:51.120 --> 3:15:57.040]  agendas he runs nothing he is no one george bush runs nothing the multinationals own run this country
[3:15:57.680 --> 3:16:04.320]  and uh at least people finally are seeing that both parties are controlled they got to be taken
[3:16:04.320 --> 3:16:11.680]  for one more ride by barack obama and they will be uh but uh that's about it i mean the republicans
[3:16:11.680 --> 3:16:16.240]  are shot the democrats are shot we got a hit rock bottom before we turn around you know i took calls
[3:16:16.240 --> 3:16:20.080]  for the rainbow gathering folks and people like us didn't really want to talk about that and that's
[3:16:20.080 --> 3:16:24.240]  that's fine and dandy uh but just in closing gentlemen anything else you want to add in a
[3:16:24.240 --> 3:16:32.560]  closing statement uh their rob savoy uh or scott well actually i would i would definitely like
[3:16:32.560 --> 3:16:37.760]  to add something and that's um you know this has been going on for over 30 years and we're used to
[3:16:37.760 --> 3:16:43.360]  it it's you know it's it's become a habit to uh be harassed to be searched um you know to be
[3:16:43.360 --> 3:16:47.760]  handcuffed and pepper sprayed and all that stuff it's become habit what was different about this
[3:16:47.760 --> 3:16:51.840]  year and the reason is about this year is because they march with live ammo into the village where
[3:16:51.840 --> 3:16:57.280]  they know we keep our children they threaten our children upset one accident one twitch of the
[3:16:57.280 --> 3:17:01.680]  finger and my child or someone else's child could have been killed and then they're gonna kill a
[3:17:01.680 --> 3:17:05.840]  bunch of end plant weapons on you're gonna have to get the videos that's the problem is that they
[3:17:05.840 --> 3:17:09.440]  would have shot a child they would have mowed everybody down hunted you down and killed you
[3:17:09.440 --> 3:17:15.600]  this i'm not kidding and especially feds and then you know taking the videos and that's the problem
[3:17:15.600 --> 3:17:22.480]  is they will escalate to cover up their crimes right and you know that's that's like i said my
[3:17:22.480 --> 3:17:28.480]  concern and the reason for maybe an escalation in our attention through the media this this year
[3:17:28.480 --> 3:17:32.960]  is because of the the fact that children were endangered and children were endangered knowingly
[3:17:32.960 --> 3:17:37.360]  it isn't like these people didn't know that the commander of that team i've i've seen him in court
[3:17:37.360 --> 3:17:42.160]  i i know that he knows what kid villages i know that he knows where kid villages well of course
[3:17:42.160 --> 3:17:45.840]  they went there to go after your kids to get a response from you there they're into psychological
[3:17:45.840 --> 3:17:50.160]  warfare they just don't realize they're under similar mind control from those above them
[3:17:50.160 --> 3:17:56.400]  uh i mean this is this is just despicable despicable activities that we're uh that we're
[3:17:56.400 --> 3:18:02.880]  seeing from them but those are great points you're making uh anything uh you want to add
[3:18:02.880 --> 3:18:09.120]  robson boy yeah i mean basically you know next year will be in new mexico july 1st to 7th um since
[3:18:09.120 --> 3:18:13.840]  the law enforcement troubles have been getting worse and worse every year um i'd say hey come on
[3:18:13.840 --> 3:18:19.120]  out to the gathering next year for some fun and games yeah i mean definitely the answer to their
[3:18:19.120 --> 3:18:25.760]  tyranny is to have 24 000 people out there 50 000 and and and because we are but inherently
[3:18:25.760 --> 3:18:30.000]  incredibly peaceful people you know no matter how bad things get the police have to realize
[3:18:30.000 --> 3:18:34.720]  that they cannot attack peaceful people now i'm surprised they have a lot less they can do it
[3:18:34.720 --> 3:18:39.120]  i'm surprised they haven't pulled provocateur actions you know they can hire their anarchists
[3:18:39.120 --> 3:18:45.280]  that dress up like hippies uh some other day call me back on that and i can talk about that for hours
[3:18:45.280 --> 3:18:49.280]  they've been doing all the stuff to us forever and ever and ever but also they do have they
[3:18:49.280 --> 3:18:54.800]  so they do have spies and provocateurs oh yeah we totally we have problems with people coming in
[3:18:54.800 --> 3:18:59.840]  and stealing equipment we have all sorts of stuff they pull out and at the west virginia gathering
[3:18:59.840 --> 3:19:03.760]  three years ago they stole the water pipe before the gathering that we use to bring clean filtered
[3:19:03.760 --> 3:19:08.480]  water to people um we could go on and on and on about all this kind of stuff but yeah i mean
[3:19:08.480 --> 3:19:12.080]  people should come next year and use their own eyes and ears and stuff to see and hear what's
[3:19:12.080 --> 3:19:17.040]  going yeah it's important to see evil for yourself exactly that's it well let's talk during this

[3:20:46.800 --> 3:20:51.440]  familiar with the federal reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with
[3:20:51.440 --> 3:20:56.080]  catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the
[3:20:56.080 --> 3:21:00.720]  amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts a fractional reserve system means only
[3:21:00.720 --> 3:21:05.280]  a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will
[3:21:05.280 --> 3:21:10.480]  skyrocket through fdic if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a
[3:21:10.480 --> 3:21:15.280]  depressed economy a current effort is underway by the fed along with other central banks to
[3:21:15.280 --> 3:21:20.080]  increase liquidity for depositors however an increase in money supply without equal expansion
[3:21:20.080 --> 3:21:25.280]  and productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability i recommend a
[3:21:25.280 --> 3:21:30.560]  conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver while
[3:21:30.560 --> 3:21:35.600]  paper investments currently have been driven by debt gold on its own has held value for over

[3:24:06.000 --> 3:24:11.920]  i tell you what let's play that clip john i sent it to you the cnn one of john mccain a few days
[3:24:11.920 --> 3:24:17.920]  ago this happening everywhere he goes this was on cnn fox c span a bunch of other places live
[3:24:17.920 --> 3:24:23.600]  got huge attention and the young man stands up and reads a peanut document i believe this is
[3:24:23.600 --> 3:24:29.840]  we are change uh stands up and reads a peanut document about you know needing terror attacks
[3:24:30.640 --> 3:24:35.200]  and uh yes they're all over the news saying we are al-qaeda we need to be arrested
[3:24:36.160 --> 3:24:43.120]  no you know no debate of did the vice president write this did john mccain fund this uh are these
[3:24:43.120 --> 3:24:47.920]  republican memos saying they want to stage terror attacks do all these leaders admit they stage terror
[3:24:47.920 --> 3:24:55.680]  attacks it isn't it's like oh no no no alex jones was secretly trained in afghanistan he uh he's
[3:24:55.680 --> 3:24:59.920]  under direct blood and command okay well let's let's say that was hypothetically true which is
[3:24:59.920 --> 3:25:08.240]  just ridiculous um i am 34 years old so i was trained as a small child reportedly um by al-qaeda
[3:25:08.240 --> 3:25:20.400]  and so that would be in the early uh 1980s late 1970s when a summer bin laden was in junior high
[3:25:21.680 --> 3:25:32.400]  i guess when i was about five years old in 79 living in dallas texas uh that would mean
[3:25:32.400 --> 3:25:39.680]  that that right when the cia founded al-qaeda was a big new brzezinski and had them attack russia
[3:25:39.680 --> 3:25:46.720]  i was sent along with lucrodownsky who wasn't born and everybody else i was sent to afghanistan
[3:25:46.720 --> 3:25:54.480]  and i was trained uh when the u.s was running the operation i mean this is the kind of crap
[3:25:54.480 --> 3:25:59.040]  they feed people and yes they are saying it there are 5000 blonde hair blue eyed al-qaeda
[3:25:59.040 --> 3:26:04.880]  they are everywhere they are sleepers trust no one i mean come on cops listening what is the latest
[3:26:04.880 --> 3:26:10.320]  thing you're gonna believe i mean is there is there is there is there no into it um and you
[3:26:10.320 --> 3:26:14.880]  said you were listening to glenn beck scott and you heard this yeah it was going back stealing
[3:26:14.880 --> 3:26:20.320]  guy that was yesterday that i heard that what was this uh lower oh he was taking colors colors on it
[3:26:20.320 --> 3:26:26.720]  afterwards did you hear that part no i didn't i had to go at that point um but i did hear
[3:26:26.720 --> 3:26:30.560]  everything he started out by saying you we didn't know where he was going with it at first you
[3:26:30.560 --> 3:26:36.960]  go there's a new film that's out into documentary film it's about 600 british kids that their parents
[3:26:36.960 --> 3:26:42.160]  sent them over to these jihadist camps to train under them i mean to learn their way of life
[3:26:42.160 --> 3:26:48.560]  and within then he said and 600 american kids and then he went on to say at that point and let me
[3:26:48.560 --> 3:26:53.920]  guess adam gadon the son of the head of the adl i'm sure he's involved this is ridiculous okay what
[3:26:53.920 --> 3:26:59.200]  else okay so basically said the first year he broke it down just like this the first year
[3:26:59.200 --> 3:27:03.280]  the they caught they went back and checked on the kids and the kids you know weren't brainwashed
[3:27:03.280 --> 3:27:08.400]  they wanted to come back home they weren't happy with it the second year they were fitting in a
[3:27:08.400 --> 3:27:12.640]  little bit better by the third year he said they were completely brainwashed and this is exactly
[3:27:12.640 --> 3:27:18.320]  how he told us and then he said at that point they they were then after after they were brainwashed
[3:27:18.320 --> 3:27:24.960]  their parents didn't brought them back to the u.s shortly thereafter and then they started um basically
[3:27:24.960 --> 3:27:31.920]  saying that night you know the government staged 911 911 was an inside job and you know basically
[3:27:31.920 --> 3:27:36.720]  trying to cause chaos in the political form against our american government here and you
[3:27:36.720 --> 3:27:43.040]  believe it protesting asking people about peanut asking about lying about wmds you're now all

[3:35:29.680 --> 3:35:35.280]  jeb bush and paul wolfworth's wrote a document titled rebuilding america's defenses and if they
[3:35:35.280 --> 3:35:40.800]  state quote the process of transformation even if it brings revolutionary change is likely to be a
[3:35:40.800 --> 3:35:47.760]  long one absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new pro harbor folks go online and
[3:35:47.760 --> 3:35:54.320]  watch his body language there i mean it is he is gets real serious in his i mean guilty is
[3:35:54.320 --> 3:36:01.040]  sin oh my goodness we're in trouble now many americans believe that that new pro harbor event
[3:36:01.040 --> 3:36:08.160]  took place on 911 and according to a recent new york times and cbs news poll 84 of americans believe
[3:36:08.160 --> 3:36:14.240]  that there were some criminal elements of our government involved in 911 hold on can you tell
[3:36:14.240 --> 3:36:18.720]  us about your role as hold on can you tell us about your role as president of the new citizen
[3:36:18.720 --> 3:36:25.520]  project founded in 1994 which served as a chief fundraising and parent organization to pina and
[3:36:25.520 --> 3:36:30.560]  is this one of the factors that has made you so reluctant to support the victims family members
[3:36:30.560 --> 3:36:36.400]  and first responders who are begging for a new investigation into 911 that's a serious question
[3:36:36.960 --> 3:36:43.760]  well i have a i have a serious answer sir and that is that it was joe Lieberman and i a democrat
[3:36:43.760 --> 3:36:50.880]  that sponsored the legislation for the 911 commission and i'm proud of that it was a bipartisan
[3:36:50.880 --> 3:36:58.720]  effort and very frankly the administration was not uh shall i say enthusiastic about the
[3:36:58.720 --> 3:37:04.880]  establishment of that commission we had some of those most respected men and women in america
[3:37:04.880 --> 3:37:12.640]  serve on that commission now with every let let let me just put it this way i am proud of what the
[3:37:12.640 --> 3:37:20.160]  911 commission did i am proud that we it proposed a total police state takeover let's go ahead and
[3:37:20.160 --> 3:37:26.000]  go back to the enemy of america we have enacted many of the reforms although not all of the reforms
[3:37:26.000 --> 3:37:32.640]  that they recommended and i will stand by their recommendations and their conclusions as well
[3:37:32.640 --> 3:37:38.160]  the overwhelming majority of americans it's a free country you are free to disagree with their
[3:37:38.160 --> 3:37:44.640]  conclusions but i am proud to have been one of those and his surrogates though are going to say
[3:37:44.640 --> 3:37:49.120]  that you're american al-qaeda oh you're free to say that but we're gonna have every tv host on
[3:37:49.120 --> 3:37:53.360]  every news channel say you're secretly working with al-qaeda and carrying out bombings and we're
[3:37:53.360 --> 3:37:57.280]  gonna have provocateurs come out to your events and hold up signs saying you murdered people and you
[3:37:57.280 --> 3:38:01.680]  carried out a bombing okay you're free to say that but we're gonna tell everybody you need to be
[3:38:01.680 --> 3:38:05.840]  locked up we're trained in an al-qaeda camp and these idiot schmucks out here in the audience
[3:38:05.840 --> 3:38:09.920]  they're going to believe it you little slave you may see right through me and i run a giant
[3:38:09.920 --> 3:38:14.080]  murder op but you're going to see a lot more you little punk you think we're not going to let go
[3:38:14.080 --> 3:38:18.320]  of power you little bastard we're going to carry out more black ops that's what the translator
[3:38:18.320 --> 3:38:24.640]  if you ran what he was saying through it would be saying back to the murderer who was with along
[3:38:24.640 --> 3:38:29.920]  with joe Lieberman responsible for the establishment of the 9 11 commission and i support that thank you
[3:38:29.920 --> 3:38:40.080]  senator thank you everybody always whines and complains about 9 11 truth and we are changed
[3:38:40.080 --> 3:38:43.440]  we do the best we can he was able to get his question out if he would have been grabbed
[3:38:43.440 --> 3:38:47.600]  around the throat by a citizen drone they've been trained to hate freedom and attack or by one of
[3:38:47.600 --> 3:38:53.440]  the goons security guards then he would have been screaming see as you're being physically attacked
[3:38:53.440 --> 3:38:58.000]  and having your hair grabbed we're not supposed to yell the questions out you must intently be
[3:38:58.000 --> 3:39:03.040]  tasered and taken out but because he was able to get it out mccain knows that keeps backfiring
[3:39:03.040 --> 3:39:07.680]  having him tasered and grabbed so he'll he'll let him go but he's listening to the question when he
[3:39:07.680 --> 3:39:13.680]  hears thing about pina he goes total body changes just his eyes get real serious he goes into focus
[3:39:13.680 --> 3:39:19.200]  mode whoa he looked he looks very concerned he looks at the guy like whoa and then he turns around
[3:39:19.200 --> 3:39:25.760]  and starts breathing a little bit heavy and he's going i mean they are really worried folks i mean
[3:39:25.760 --> 3:39:29.840]  we go up to heart and heart goes yeah we stage terror attacks yes yes i'm afraid we're gonna do it
[3:39:29.840 --> 3:39:34.640]  and then and then he kind of flips out and starts pacing back and forth in in in the film
[3:39:34.640 --> 3:39:39.120]  just looking crazy i mean they're starting to break down folks we went him to bow deedle
[3:39:39.120 --> 3:39:43.200]  the former head of new york detectives who's attacked us for 9 11 truth and he comes up he

[3:40:20.480 --> 3:40:26.480]  because because i've got to cover this 9 11 truth information i've got to let you know that we are
[3:40:26.480 --> 3:40:33.920]  very close to busting the people that did it i mean we know now who they are we it is it is

[3:41:26.720 --> 3:41:31.040]  be at the forefront of all this but i have a responsibility to fight these people and plus
[3:41:31.040 --> 3:41:36.400]  if i've if my life's not worth a plug nickel if i don't stay prominent that's another reason to
[3:41:36.400 --> 3:41:43.040]  keep me in the fight and also i mean if i'm if i'm in so much danger as i am a lot of us are
[3:41:43.040 --> 3:41:45.680]  prominent you know i better go all the way i better make sure this counts
[3:41:49.280 --> 3:41:56.960]  folks the government took 4300 plus american children in one declassified program
[3:41:56.960 --> 3:42:03.680]  that foster care had taken cps had taken and they radiated them to death now now that's just one
[3:42:03.680 --> 3:42:11.360]  declassified program we had another where thousands of gi's wives would go in to have their babies at
[3:42:11.360 --> 3:42:17.120]  the local bases in new mexico arizona texas california and they would give them uranium and
[3:42:17.120 --> 3:42:21.280]  plutonium pills as vitamins and the doctors would know that we're gonna have a miscarriage in so
[3:42:21.280 --> 3:42:25.600]  many hours they'd be there with film cameras and they'd say we're just filming this this will help
[3:42:25.600 --> 3:42:29.120]  you and the people are so trusting in their government as the woman's baby died his lot
[3:42:29.120 --> 3:42:35.600]  him she died they would film it that's been declassified for 20 something years and there's
[3:42:35.600 --> 3:42:40.240]  thousands of these i could go on for hours and there are people in the message boards whenever
[3:42:40.240 --> 3:42:48.240]  i talk about this and people post this on youtube who say i'm lying i'm not lying those are all
[3:42:48.240 --> 3:42:52.880]  public it's like i had a call earlier saying where's the proof she wasn't doubting him she said

[3:42:58.160 --> 3:43:02.400]  complex and i just typed in larry silverstein sears tower it was the number one link wall street
[3:43:02.400 --> 3:43:08.320]  journal and i think a lot of people just don't know how to search for stuff i mean it isn't hard
[3:43:08.320 --> 3:43:14.640]  larry silverstein sears tower uh just type biological chemical radiological testing on
[3:43:14.640 --> 3:43:25.920]  civilians folks i i did 20 minutes in in in in game on it and i could literally make a 500 hour
[3:43:25.920 --> 3:43:32.400]  film no exaggeration just reading off parts the headers of government documents admitting
[3:43:32.400 --> 3:43:37.040]  where they killed people i mean it's in the it's got to be in the hundreds of thousands
[3:43:37.040 --> 3:43:43.120]  here in the u.s tens of thousands uh in every other major country england england is the uh
[3:43:45.040 --> 3:43:52.320]  they've done a bunch of it uh in singapore i had a guy i know who's one of the top guys in the
[3:43:52.320 --> 3:43:56.960]  republican party and he owns a computer company but i know him going back when i was a republican
[3:43:56.960 --> 3:44:03.200]  15 years ago up till about 13 years ago and uh you know friends with him and he's pretty high
[3:44:03.200 --> 3:44:08.240]  level now and i saw him and he he would he said he'd come on the show then he chickened out
[3:44:08.240 --> 3:44:12.560]  and i had to promise it was all in confidence and then he checked out to come on but he just
[3:44:12.560 --> 3:44:16.800]  talked about how he's involved in singapore with these programs and they put different drugs and
[3:44:16.800 --> 3:44:21.040]  different sectors of the city because it's all in sectors there to test it on the public i mean
[3:44:21.040 --> 3:44:25.760]  it's you know and i saw a thing in minnesota where they're putting stuff out with the pigeons
[3:44:25.760 --> 3:44:29.760]  that sterilizes them and i held the documents where they're doing that here and and i mean
[3:44:29.760 --> 3:44:33.840]  we're just screwed i don't even know why i have to try to convince you i mean we're in
[3:44:36.080 --> 3:44:40.560]  and then the people go on the youtube and say i'm lying my god it's all true i mean what what are
[3:44:40.560 --> 3:44:49.360]  you talking about i mean i know a guy who's a republican high level in the state party who
[3:44:49.360 --> 3:44:53.520]  who knows people and is involved with companies that are doing it and he's like yeah it's crazy
[3:44:53.520 --> 3:44:57.600]  i think i'll talk about it well i better not or or then i have documents where they're doing it or
[3:44:58.320 --> 3:45:04.720]  rick perry's uh chief of staff he's got three different chiefs i'm not going to say who but
[3:45:04.720 --> 3:45:09.120]  he's a he's ahead of one of his details you ever watch him rick perry on tv you'll see the guy
[3:45:09.120 --> 3:45:13.040]  with him ought to try to call and get him on he gave me his card and acted like i could talk about
[3:45:13.040 --> 3:45:18.480]  it but i don't want to ought to try to get him on but he i think he was so shook up after in game
[3:45:18.480 --> 3:45:24.960]  that he said it to me last year when i was showing it but but he was a medic i think he said 15 years
[3:45:24.960 --> 3:45:31.280]  ago in the army and they would have him give people inoculations and uh these uh i think you
[3:45:31.280 --> 3:45:36.080]  said eight guys i told the story last year when i was fresher memory but it was seven eight guys
[3:45:36.080 --> 3:45:41.600]  coming in from a special forces base fort rag and they're told watch these men they were just
[3:45:41.600 --> 3:45:47.600]  given a new experimental inoculation and all of them died within a day i mean you know throwing
[3:45:47.600 --> 3:45:53.680]  up stuff coming out their eyes and then they were told don't worry it's not contagious now take all
[3:45:53.680 --> 3:45:59.120]  the metal stuff out take all the beds out scrub them outside spray bleach on them uh and then put
[3:45:59.120 --> 3:46:03.440]  them back and he said yeah we were then told it was like a biological test they just killed those
[3:46:03.440 --> 3:46:11.200]  guys you understand special ops listening they killed you whenever they feel like it you're
[3:46:11.200 --> 3:46:15.600]  saying well that's rick perry's chief of staff saying that to you he came to my event he said we
[3:46:15.600 --> 3:46:20.560]  wanted to see the film we knew the governor was in it uh we uh the film ends with me you know
[3:46:20.560 --> 3:46:27.680]  confronting the governor at his house you know they're outside and he said uh but i do want to

[3:54:05.280 --> 3:54:10.240]  destroyed or anything that's going on or how it was designed what are they going to do when they
[3:54:10.240 --> 3:54:15.360]  find out not only is their money worthless but now hundreds of trillions of dollars conservatively
[3:54:15.360 --> 3:54:20.320]  is going to be put on their tax bill forever while the globalist bought up all the real assets
[3:54:20.320 --> 3:54:23.760]  they're going to be sitting in the street trying to order for food and it's not going to be it's
[3:54:23.760 --> 3:54:30.320]  not going to happen unless people get prepared now and that's where you've got hard assets at
[3:54:30.320 --> 3:54:35.920]  their beckoning call right now but i'll be honest with the alex i mean it's not going to be there
[3:54:35.920 --> 3:54:43.440]  forever we had a hard time getting silver and gold last year and towards you know even this year in
[3:54:43.440 --> 3:54:48.240]  the spring and it's going to happen and we've never seen a summer like this apply i mean just to
[3:54:48.240 --> 3:54:54.080]  be clear here we've never seen a summer where where it goes into a bull market dollars plunging
[3:54:54.080 --> 3:54:59.520]  every commodity is exploding gold is up since last week remember early last week i'm saying
[3:54:59.520 --> 3:55:04.560]  folks is going to start going up it's at 882 and now what is it right now it's at nine what
[3:55:05.120 --> 3:55:10.800]  nine sixty four fifty last i looked nine sixty four fifty so it's up over eighty
[3:55:11.440 --> 3:55:16.320]  one dollars in one week ladies and gentlemen i didn't come up here three weeks ago and say
[3:55:16.320 --> 3:55:21.760]  it'd be that next week i came on last week and said get ready and they can try to suppress it
[3:55:21.760 --> 3:55:25.920]  again folks but it's only going to the stars whenever you start seeing all the big money guys
[3:55:25.920 --> 3:55:30.160]  say it's going to go to five thousand ounce and i'm telling you they've got gold deals at minus
[3:55:30.160 --> 3:55:37.440]  resources right now that are steals on these francs on on the british sovereigns and on the
[3:55:37.440 --> 3:55:42.160]  silver tell them about the offer god yeah and i mean to be honest with the alex i forgot to say i
[3:55:42.160 --> 3:55:49.040]  got interrupted again ted bought these at nine twenty six he's offering these at below spot go
[3:55:49.040 --> 3:55:53.760]  go ahead tell him oh i mean seriously i mean that's what it is but i mean before i got on the show
[3:55:53.760 --> 3:55:58.480]  here i tried to get on the internet to even look up some of these prices and it's so busy out there
[3:55:58.480 --> 3:56:03.280]  right now i couldn't even get through the sites i mean this is the way the things are breaking
[3:56:03.280 --> 3:56:09.600]  i mean we got the dollar down in massive format today we got the financial markets that are
[3:56:09.600 --> 3:56:15.280]  just out of control but right now you can get british sovereigns for instance quarter ounce
[3:56:15.280 --> 3:56:22.880]  gold pieces at two fifty seven i mean that's incredible you've got the french francs at 205
[3:56:22.880 --> 3:56:27.840]  an ounce and that's a gold coin that's a fifth ounce gold coin i mean you're looking at gold
[3:56:28.400 --> 3:56:35.120]  right now at nine sixty four fifty do the math people it's not a big thing you've got silver
[3:56:35.120 --> 3:56:43.600]  which is my recommendation and 189 20 for a role of walking liberty half dollars
[3:56:44.560 --> 3:56:50.480]  i mean you're talking about 20 coins i mean i want to be clear that's spectacular ted locked
[3:56:50.480 --> 3:56:56.560]  these in at the price uh you know per ounce of nine twenty six and they're also collectors there's
[3:56:56.560 --> 3:57:03.760]  a little bit of markup so uh the point is these coins would be what uh if ted was doing it on
[3:57:03.760 --> 3:57:09.040]  today's gold prices how much would that british sovereign be the british sovereign right now if
[3:57:09.040 --> 3:57:14.240]  he were and i don't know why he's selling it at this price i don't um because right now they would
[3:57:14.240 --> 3:57:21.280]  be about nine sixty nine or i mean two sixty nine they're two fifty seven we're looking at the
[3:57:21.280 --> 3:57:28.160]  francs at 205 well in all honesty i mean i don't know how we can make money on that now we're
[3:57:28.160 --> 3:57:32.800]  looking at probably 220 this morning and you said he wants to do this to crush all the competition
[3:57:32.800 --> 3:57:37.760]  you want to get right down to it ted just loves my listeners you cannot beat this deal this is a
[3:57:37.760 --> 3:57:43.760]  loser for ted anderson it only goes to the weekend one eight hundred six eight six two two three seven
