[00:00.000 --> 00:14.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.200 --> 00:25.320]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones thank you for joining us on
[00:25.320 --> 00:32.040]  this Monday October 13 2008 edition we're gonna be live here for the next four hours coming up to
[00:32.040 --> 00:39.400]  30 minutes we have a Mr. Ingall joining us to go over what's happening in the world markets as
[00:39.400 --> 00:46.520]  the new owner banking system as the international banks are calling it themselves use the crises
[00:46.520 --> 00:52.840]  they have engineered to consolidate power and control so we're gonna be going over that today
[00:52.840 --> 00:57.840]  Bob Desi joins us again in studio I had so much fun with him last week I wanted to have him back
[00:57.840 --> 01:05.680]  again with us money markets ease on unlimited dollars pledge that's the CNBC headline unlimited
[01:05.680 --> 01:14.840]  dollar pledge worldwide to finance basically any select bank brokerage firm private corporations
[01:14.840 --> 01:23.120]  sub-states of countries including the 50 states here in the United States money markets ease on
[01:23.120 --> 01:31.680]  unlimited dollars pledge that means hyperinflation Dow bounces more than 400 points it's almost 500
[01:31.680 --> 01:37.160]  as we speak after cash infusion Dow Jones industrial average was at 400 points or 5%
[01:37.160 --> 01:41.280]  within the first few minutes of trading and it's been right around that of the last two and a half
[01:41.280 --> 01:46.160]  hours since it opened global markets are giving a lot of approval to what the government's central
[01:46.160 --> 01:50.600]  banks and the US Treasury are doing to boost confidence in the market well now that's not
[01:50.600 --> 01:58.560]  what's happening they're just pumping money into it so of course it's going up bailout architect
[01:58.560 --> 02:05.960]  is selecting managers now to hand out the 700 plus billion US officials said to offer protection
[02:05.960 --> 02:14.520]  to Japan's investors not just banks dollar euro sterling may be destroyed by Zimbabwe style
[02:14.520 --> 02:24.600]  inflation story by Paul Joseph Watson we'll be getting into that report UK bails out three
[02:24.600 --> 02:31.520]  more major banks calls it nationalization 64 billion just a day alone a wave of mergers could
[02:31.520 --> 02:39.160]  hit banking sector as the central banks consolidate their hold and grasp and again we see this new
[02:39.160 --> 02:43.080]  economic order which is not a new economic order to the same private families that own
[02:43.080 --> 02:50.760]  the world central banks basically taking over right now in Bloomberg is reporting on that
[02:50.760 --> 02:58.200]  that is just some of what we're going to be covering today on the financial front on the
[02:58.200 --> 03:04.520]  police state front I mentioned some of this on my Sunday show but we need to get back into
[03:04.520 --> 03:11.800]  it today and we're going to do that I have never seen so much alternative media and
[03:11.800 --> 03:18.280]  even mainstream media finally looking at the martial law control grid the cashless society
[03:18.280 --> 03:23.600]  control grid the Pentagon designed tracking and tracing system has been put in but the
[03:23.600 --> 03:28.640]  left is panicking I want to get her on this week Naomi Wolf and of course the democracy
[03:28.640 --> 03:34.000]  now had Amy Goodman they think that all this martial law is transitory and only about George
[03:34.000 --> 03:39.920]  Bush and that it will supposedly I guess fade away after he leaves office so they think
[03:39.920 --> 03:46.400]  of the next 20 something days that martial law may be declared hey martial law was declared
[03:46.400 --> 03:51.840]  decades ago in the markets they declare a new emergency each year that's how the executive
[03:51.840 --> 03:57.960]  operates outside the legislative and judicial when you have the Congress a week and a half
[03:57.960 --> 04:03.080]  ago being threatened with martial law and that the president would just do it anyways
[04:03.080 --> 04:09.400]  if they didn't pass the banker empowerment takeover bill that is martial law so we'll
[04:09.400 --> 04:13.880]  be going over that today and the media is trying to frame this as if we don't have hot
[04:13.880 --> 04:19.800]  martial law in the streets like red dawn everywhere with troops parachuting out of the skies and
[04:19.800 --> 04:26.000]  putting everybody at gunpoint that it isn't martial law no it's incremental training you
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.560]  to accept troops on the streets newscast all over the country going all the regular armies
[04:30.560 --> 04:35.120]  working with our local police oh they're helping it's about that acclimation so we'll break
[04:35.120 --> 04:39.720]  down what's really happening there tie it in with the license plate scanning systems
[04:39.720 --> 04:43.360]  scanning everything everywhere you go already putting you in a database all movements already
[04:43.360 --> 04:48.120]  tracked and recorded the military rolling out high powered microwave guns to be using
[04:48.120 --> 04:52.240]  American people local police departments to get the systems people being arrested for
[04:52.240 --> 05:02.520]  having a brown lawn this is the type of news we'll be covering today stay with us they
[05:02.520 --> 05:07.280]  say you can't predict the stock market if you trade on a regular basis you've probably
[05:07.280 --> 05:11.360]  heard that lie but what if I told you there's a way to know which way the market will go

[06:03.360 --> 06:09.080]  with hundreds of my fellow troops I went to ground here and we knew what to do or at least
[06:09.080 --> 06:14.400]  we thought we did. Truth rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders
[06:14.400 --> 06:23.440]  a platform to tell their story. Whitman, EPA director on the 18 made a statement that the
[06:23.440 --> 06:29.280]  air was safe to breathe. This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave
[06:29.280 --> 06:34.080]  souls throughout the world take action against their global masters. He had his hand over
[06:34.080 --> 06:41.040]  the radio while he was getting a countdown. He took his hand off and he made 3 2 1 and
[06:41.040 --> 06:45.180]  then it was boom boom boom boom boom. This is an emergency transmission worldwide.ai
[06:45.180 --> 06:51.440]  download truth rising prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order
[06:51.440 --> 06:56.600]  the dvd at infowars.com if we don't expose the government's sponsored terror they're
[06:56.600 --> 07:01.080]  going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[07:01.080 --> 07:03.560]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel
[07:03.560 --> 07:05.480]  and laugh at the rising price of gas?

[08:00.560 --> 08:03.560]  There is no other power greater than the power over money,
[08:03.560 --> 08:06.680]  the power to create and contract the money supply,
[08:06.680 --> 08:11.600]  the power to control the purchasing power of your money.
[08:11.600 --> 08:13.520]  Throughout history, this has proven
[08:13.520 --> 08:18.400]  to be the most sought after monopolistic power of man.
[08:18.400 --> 08:21.840]  It has become more sophisticated over the decades
[08:21.840 --> 08:24.480]  and over the centuries, more sophisticated now
[08:24.480 --> 08:27.480]  and more international in scope than ever before.
[08:27.480 --> 08:30.360]  So I see the issue of power and the control over money
[08:30.360 --> 08:35.360]  as being something that we cannot ignore, we must address.
[08:35.360 --> 08:37.480]  I believe closely associated with this
[08:37.480 --> 08:40.120]  is the issue of morality as well.
[08:40.120 --> 08:43.480]  By what moral right do we have to create purchasing power
[08:43.480 --> 08:45.280]  out of thin air, whether it's done
[08:45.280 --> 08:47.800]  by the creation of credit or Federal Reserve notes
[08:47.800 --> 08:49.680]  or whether it's the creation of SDRs
[08:49.680 --> 08:53.640]  and an international scope, by what right do they do this?
[08:53.640 --> 08:56.200]  Is it any more moral to dilute the value
[08:56.200 --> 08:57.520]  of your purchasing power over the money
[08:57.520 --> 08:59.680]  you hold in your wallet than it is for the farmer
[08:59.680 --> 09:02.760]  to dilute the milk supply with water?
[09:02.760 --> 09:05.040]  I would say there's an issue of morality here
[09:05.040 --> 09:08.640]  just as strong as the issue of power.
[09:08.640 --> 09:12.480]  I also happen to believe also because it's a moral issue more
[09:12.480 --> 09:14.280]  than an economic issue.
[09:14.280 --> 09:16.800]  It is for this reason that the people have lost trust
[09:16.800 --> 09:19.480]  in their government, trust in the banks, trust in business,
[09:19.480 --> 09:23.480]  trust in themselves, and that we are a nation of distrust.
[09:23.480 --> 09:26.240]  And it's for this reason I believe that until we restore
[09:26.240 --> 09:28.880]  trust in government, trust in the system,
[09:28.880 --> 09:31.760]  and trust in the money, there will be no resolution
[09:31.760 --> 09:33.000]  of this problem.
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.760]  It is the issue of trust in people and trust in money
[09:36.760 --> 09:40.200]  that must come before you can start talking about
[09:40.200 --> 09:42.360]  nickeling and diamond and trying to get back
[09:42.360 --> 09:45.560]  to a balanced budget because that certainly hasn't worked.
[09:46.680 --> 09:48.400]  So I think it's important to address
[09:48.400 --> 09:52.120]  the issue of central planning, the issue of power,
[09:52.120 --> 09:54.800]  and third, I think that we must address
[09:54.800 --> 09:57.960]  in general terms the issue of the origin of money.
[09:57.960 --> 10:01.200]  I know that's been talked about and we recognize
[10:01.200 --> 10:03.720]  those of us who believe in commodity money
[10:03.720 --> 10:06.960]  clearly understand that money, paper money,
[10:06.960 --> 10:09.680]  and credit creation didn't come out of the marketplace.
[10:09.680 --> 10:13.400]  That came out of the heads and the fantasies
[10:13.400 --> 10:16.600]  of the intellectuals and the government officials
[10:16.600 --> 10:18.880]  of those who want paper to be money,
[10:18.880 --> 10:21.280]  but never out of the marketplace.
[10:21.280 --> 10:24.680]  So I would say the paper standard is bucking history
[10:24.680 --> 10:28.120]  and it's bucking economic law and economic truth,
[10:28.120 --> 10:31.160]  and they only can do it with force and more power
[10:31.160 --> 10:34.560]  to make people accept it because economically
[10:34.560 --> 10:38.120]  and historically, paper is not money.
[10:38.120 --> 10:39.280]  It can't be money.
[10:39.280 --> 10:41.640]  It's only money because we're forced to use it
[10:41.640 --> 10:44.360]  and because there's a residual trust
[10:44.360 --> 10:46.520]  in the pieces of paper that we carried around
[10:46.520 --> 10:50.760]  because at one time it did have real value.
[10:50.760 --> 10:53.560]  You have to have something that people seek after
[10:53.560 --> 10:56.200]  and they hold as something important
[10:56.200 --> 10:58.480]  and something that they will hold as money.
[10:58.480 --> 11:02.120]  History shows that people have chosen gold first
[11:02.120 --> 11:03.760]  and probably silver second.
[11:03.760 --> 11:06.880]  They'd rather have cigarettes than pieces of paper.
[11:06.880 --> 11:11.480]  ["The Big Brother"]
[11:11.480 --> 11:16.320]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[11:16.320 --> 11:17.920]  You want answers?
[11:17.920 --> 11:19.440]  Well, so does he.
[11:19.440 --> 11:23.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[11:23.600 --> 11:29.120]  and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[11:29.120 --> 11:37.160]  That was Congressman Ron Paul 30 years ago to this month.
[11:37.160 --> 11:42.080]  30 years ago, laying out what the private Federal Reserve
[11:42.080 --> 11:45.360]  was engineering.
[11:45.360 --> 11:46.960]  Before I get into what's happening in the markets
[11:46.960 --> 11:48.640]  right now and the open announcement
[11:48.640 --> 11:50.800]  that they're going to totally devalue the dollar
[11:50.800 --> 11:53.200]  over the next two years, that's what the announcements mean.
[11:53.200 --> 11:58.760]  I want to play you a clip from Ron Paul last night on MSNBC.
[11:58.760 --> 12:05.600]  This is Ron Paul talking about how the banks are basically
[12:05.600 --> 12:07.840]  setting up, excuse me, Friday night,
[12:07.840 --> 12:10.280]  talking about how the central bankers are setting up
[12:10.280 --> 12:12.440]  a world government system.
[12:12.440 --> 12:15.120]  And that's what it's being called a world government oven
[12:15.120 --> 12:17.360]  by the private central banks that have always
[12:17.360 --> 12:20.600]  been organizing this global corporate state that
[12:20.600 --> 12:25.680]  will act as the receivership arm for the world's economy.
[12:25.680 --> 12:28.000]  And then they will have a militarized world government
[12:28.000 --> 12:33.080]  army that then protects and owns the system.
[12:33.080 --> 12:36.920]  So here is that clip with Ron Paul not 30 years ago,
[12:36.920 --> 12:38.320]  but three days ago.
[12:38.320 --> 12:39.760]  Did you think of it?
[12:39.760 --> 12:42.080]  Well, I think it's more of the same.
[12:42.080 --> 12:44.600]  How can you buy up equities with debt?
[12:44.600 --> 12:45.720]  They don't have any money.
[12:45.720 --> 12:47.480]  They just create the money out of sitting there.
[12:47.480 --> 12:51.120]  They talk about recapitalization and they're using debt.
[12:51.120 --> 12:53.920]  Capital in the capitalist system comes from savings.
[12:53.920 --> 12:54.920]  We have zero savings.
[12:54.920 --> 12:56.960]  That's how we got into this problem.
[12:56.960 --> 13:00.720]  But to just spend another $700 billion or whatever
[13:00.720 --> 13:03.400]  and claim you can buy up illiquid assets,
[13:03.400 --> 13:06.760]  the illiquid assets are worth what they are.
[13:06.760 --> 13:10.640]  So this will do nothing more than just show how panic they are.
[13:10.640 --> 13:12.360]  Every time they announce one of these,
[13:12.360 --> 13:15.040]  the markets realize that they're just thrashing about
[13:15.040 --> 13:17.040]  and they panic and they sell their stocks
[13:17.040 --> 13:19.080]  because they don't know what the devil they're doing.
[13:19.080 --> 13:22.480]  They're socializing the entire financial system.
[13:22.480 --> 13:24.920]  Is it that far, Ron Paul?
[13:24.920 --> 13:27.800]  Is it the fact that they are putting a little bit
[13:27.800 --> 13:32.520]  of US capital or taxpayer money into helping out
[13:32.520 --> 13:34.640]  to providing a little more liquidity to the bank?
[13:34.640 --> 13:35.480]  Stop right there.
[13:35.480 --> 13:36.320]  Is it that or?
[13:36.320 --> 13:38.600]  John, a little bit of money.
[13:38.600 --> 13:42.120]  $5 trillion is what is in that banker takeover bill.
[13:42.120 --> 13:44.400]  On record, Bloomberg and other publications
[13:44.400 --> 13:46.240]  have rightly said at least $5 trillion.
[13:46.240 --> 13:47.800]  It could be as high as $10 trillion,
[13:47.800 --> 13:49.560]  but $5 trillion is conservative.
[13:49.560 --> 13:50.960]  That's what's spelled out in there.
[13:50.960 --> 13:54.200]  And unlimited powers for this small inner group
[13:54.200 --> 13:55.840]  of international banks.
[13:55.840 --> 13:57.280]  And then the point gets brought up.
[13:57.280 --> 13:58.240]  Is this a conspiracy?
[13:58.240 --> 14:00.200]  Are they taking over other banks?
[14:00.200 --> 14:02.560]  And that is exactly what is happening.
[14:02.560 --> 14:03.400]  Here it is.
[14:04.400 --> 14:06.200]  Is it that or do you really suspect
[14:06.200 --> 14:08.160]  that there's something bigger afoot here?
[14:08.160 --> 14:09.760]  Do you think there's a conspiracy
[14:09.760 --> 14:11.240]  to take over all the banks?
[14:11.240 --> 14:13.840]  Well, no, they just have a plan.
[14:13.840 --> 14:15.960]  They believe in socialism and I don't.
[14:15.960 --> 14:17.160]  Yeah, stop right there.
[14:17.160 --> 14:19.960]  Back in about 20 seconds to that guy's stupid statement
[14:19.960 --> 14:21.720]  about a little bit of money.
[14:21.720 --> 14:23.400]  Number one, it's not a little bit.
[14:23.400 --> 14:24.720]  He will devalue the currency.
[14:24.720 --> 14:26.400]  We've already had about half the currency devalued
[14:26.400 --> 14:27.920]  in the last seven years.
[14:27.920 --> 14:30.320]  They're talking about devaluing the rest of it.
[14:30.320 --> 14:34.600]  Understand, the dollar has lost 99% of its value
[14:34.600 --> 14:37.040]  since the private banks took over in 1913.
[14:37.040 --> 14:40.440]  So all we have is that 1% of its value that's left.
[14:40.440 --> 14:45.440]  That's the current value and around half of the devaluation
[14:47.200 --> 14:48.600]  has just happened in the last seven years.
[14:48.600 --> 14:53.600]  So it took from 1913 up until 2008 to devalue the currency
[14:57.520 --> 14:59.960]  up to the point that we've got.
[14:59.960 --> 15:02.480]  And most of that's happened in the last seven years.
[15:03.480 --> 15:05.560]  Now they're talking about devaluing
[15:05.560 --> 15:08.680]  it the rest of the way in the next two to three years maximum.
[15:08.680 --> 15:11.480]  I mean, that's the facts. There's no getting around it.
[15:11.480 --> 15:13.360]  They are killing the currency and setting up
[15:13.360 --> 15:16.600]  the global government that will create a new world currency,
[15:16.600 --> 15:17.720]  which will be regionalized.
[15:17.720 --> 15:19.840]  You'll still have, say, US, it'll still say British,
[15:19.840 --> 15:22.560]  it'll still say French, just like the Euro,
[15:22.560 --> 15:25.960]  but it is going to be global.
[15:25.960 --> 15:27.920]  All right, let's go back to the clip.
[15:27.920 --> 15:28.760]  And I love how Ron Paul says,
[15:28.760 --> 15:30.800]  no, it's not a conspiracy, it's a plan.
[15:30.800 --> 15:33.880]  It's a stated public plan. Here it is.
[15:33.880 --> 15:35.920]  Is it that or do you really suspect
[15:35.920 --> 15:37.800]  that there's something bigger afoot here?
[15:37.800 --> 15:39.360]  I mean, do you think there's a conspiracy
[15:39.360 --> 15:40.960]  to take over all the banks?
[15:40.960 --> 15:43.360]  Well, no, they just have a plan.
[15:43.360 --> 15:46.480]  They believe in socialism and I don't.
[15:46.480 --> 15:48.920]  I think there is something very, very big going on.
[15:48.920 --> 15:51.520]  I think this is the end of a monetary system
[15:51.520 --> 15:54.400]  that started in 1971.
[15:54.400 --> 15:58.120]  And it has allowed the dollar to be king
[15:58.120 --> 16:00.200]  and the dollar hegemony is ending.
[16:00.200 --> 16:02.280]  And they're rushing everybody's interest
[16:02.280 --> 16:05.520]  is popping up the system because everybody holds dollars.
[16:05.520 --> 16:07.280]  That's what's in the reserves.
[16:07.280 --> 16:09.760]  So they're frantically trying to get together
[16:09.760 --> 16:12.320]  and that's why this is becoming international.
[16:12.320 --> 16:14.160]  And boy, I'm worried about this weekend.
[16:14.160 --> 16:15.160]  What are they going to come up with?
[16:15.160 --> 16:16.760]  They're going to come up with a new idea,
[16:16.760 --> 16:19.320]  probably one central bank for the world.
[16:19.320 --> 16:21.480]  So this is not good.
[16:21.480 --> 16:23.800]  And they take this and they build up the panic
[16:23.800 --> 16:26.360]  and build up the fear to do terrible things.
[16:26.360 --> 16:27.720]  They do it in foreign policy.
[16:27.720 --> 16:31.680]  They do it after 9-11 to undermine our system,
[16:31.680 --> 16:32.840]  undermine our freedoms.
[16:32.840 --> 16:36.880]  And now they're going to take over all private ownership.
[16:36.880 --> 16:39.400]  Why don't they allow the correction to occur?
[16:39.400 --> 16:42.080]  Why don't the there's bad debt out there
[16:42.080 --> 16:43.520]  and you can't prop out bad debt.
[16:43.520 --> 16:46.040]  They're doing exactly what we did in the Depression.
[16:46.040 --> 16:47.480]  Keep the prices high.
[16:47.480 --> 16:49.880]  The prices of houses have to come down.
[16:49.880 --> 16:51.880]  And we don't need to stimulate housing.
[16:51.880 --> 16:53.240]  They kind of are stimulating housing,
[16:53.240 --> 16:54.800]  keep prices of housing up.
[16:54.800 --> 16:56.320]  It's the worst thing in the world to do.
[16:56.320 --> 16:59.800]  That was like keeping farm products high during the Depression
[16:59.800 --> 17:01.720]  by plowing crops under it.
[17:01.720 --> 17:03.680]  I don't think we've learned a thing from the Depression
[17:03.680 --> 17:06.160]  because we have no confidence or understanding
[17:06.160 --> 17:09.280]  how the capitalist system is supposed to work.
[17:09.280 --> 17:10.320]  Absolutely.
[17:10.320 --> 17:13.320]  And the free market system is being blamed for all of this
[17:13.320 --> 17:17.080]  when insider corruption and collusion with the government
[17:17.080 --> 17:20.280]  and the collusion of a select group of money masters
[17:21.800 --> 17:24.880]  have set up a system where they need direct economies.
[17:24.880 --> 17:27.320]  They need to get people in debt
[17:27.320 --> 17:31.280]  so that they can get control of the entire financial system,
[17:31.280 --> 17:36.480]  not just the central areas of the financial system.
[17:36.480 --> 17:38.480]  And that is exactly what was proposed this weekend.
[17:38.480 --> 17:40.600]  They've been proposing it for months, publicly,
[17:40.600 --> 17:43.760]  for years in high-level economic white papers
[17:43.760 --> 17:45.320]  in between governments.
[17:45.320 --> 17:48.120]  You have the private banks, the central banks of Europe
[17:48.120 --> 17:50.600]  and the United States, owned by the same group of families.
[17:50.600 --> 17:53.000]  And those families are all intermarried.
[17:53.000 --> 17:58.240]  And look, up on the Corbett report on YouTube,
[17:58.240 --> 18:00.200]  I've asked listeners to do this, and he's one of the few
[18:00.200 --> 18:01.680]  that's done it and we appreciate it.
[18:01.680 --> 18:05.760]  He went back and he found a show we did in March of last year.
[18:05.760 --> 18:08.320]  So about a year and a half ago,
[18:08.320 --> 18:11.840]  where in two minutes and 30 seconds on my radio show,
[18:13.000 --> 18:16.200]  I was asked by a caller to lay out basically
[18:16.200 --> 18:18.280]  what was gonna happen and what was happening,
[18:18.280 --> 18:19.320]  and what did I say?
[18:20.800 --> 18:23.280]  I said, you've got private central banks
[18:23.280 --> 18:26.560]  that need to wreck economies so they can consolidate them.
[18:26.560 --> 18:28.320]  And then I explained how they go in
[18:28.320 --> 18:29.520]  and get control of nations
[18:29.520 --> 18:32.120]  and they have the nations get into deep debt.
[18:32.120 --> 18:34.680]  They create all these leverage derivatives.
[18:34.680 --> 18:37.600]  The elite goes out and buys real assets with it
[18:37.600 --> 18:39.880]  and then they get positioned into safe areas.
[18:39.880 --> 18:42.040]  Then they start blowing out the Ponzi scheme
[18:42.040 --> 18:44.760]  and tricked the governments and the public
[18:44.760 --> 18:48.640]  into believing that if the people don't fully sign on
[18:48.640 --> 18:50.280]  to the imploding debt bubble,
[18:50.280 --> 18:52.120]  that they'll be bankrupted when in truth,
[18:52.120 --> 18:55.720]  they're signing on to be indentured servants.
[18:55.720 --> 18:57.040]  And then I talked about how they then use
[18:57.040 --> 19:00.400]  the militarized police state to maintain that control.
[19:00.400 --> 19:02.040]  Everything you're now seeing unfold.
[19:02.040 --> 19:04.920]  Now again, it's not like I'm smart
[19:04.920 --> 19:06.040]  or that I'm some genius.
[19:06.040 --> 19:08.040]  I have world history, I have current history.
[19:08.040 --> 19:10.180]  I have seen what the IMF and World Bank have done
[19:10.180 --> 19:11.760]  for these private banking families.
[19:11.760 --> 19:14.760]  That's their front in hundreds of third world nations
[19:14.760 --> 19:17.080]  over and over again in the same nations
[19:17.080 --> 19:19.760]  from Nigeria to Argentina to Brazil
[19:19.760 --> 19:21.960]  to Japan for that matter.
[19:21.960 --> 19:26.800]  And they do this and the 1929 implosion
[19:26.800 --> 19:29.120]  that went on for a decade was engineered.
[19:29.120 --> 19:33.000]  And we were in much better off individually at that point
[19:33.000 --> 19:34.920]  and seven million people starved to death.
[19:35.840 --> 19:40.840]  So it is just horrible to see the authors of all of this
[19:42.120 --> 19:44.600]  financially terrorizing the markets.
[19:44.600 --> 19:48.680]  What they're saying and doing is what is driving them down.
[19:48.680 --> 19:51.160]  And then they get to pose as the saviors
[19:51.160 --> 19:53.760]  and they'll pump the market up for a few days,
[19:53.760 --> 19:55.800]  a few weeks and then plunge it even further
[19:55.800 --> 19:57.880]  once they get the new powers they want.
[19:57.880 --> 19:58.880]  We'll be right back.
[20:01.080 --> 20:03.280]  A day unlike any other in the long course
[20:03.280 --> 20:06.360]  of American history, a terrorist act of war
[20:06.360 --> 20:07.800]  against this country.
[20:07.800 --> 20:10.480]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[20:10.480 --> 20:12.000]  But who is the enemy?
[20:12.000 --> 20:12.840]  Bin Laden.
[20:12.840 --> 20:13.920]  This is his MO.
[20:13.920 --> 20:15.120]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[20:15.120 --> 20:17.160]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[20:17.160 --> 20:20.240]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[20:20.240 --> 20:22.400]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[20:22.400 --> 20:24.240]  inside the United States.
[20:24.240 --> 20:26.720]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis
[20:26.720 --> 20:31.080]  again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[20:31.080 --> 20:34.920]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[20:34.920 --> 20:36.720]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA,
[20:36.720 --> 20:38.680]  the hijackers ties to the FBI,
[20:38.680 --> 20:40.160]  the Saudi Arabian connection,
[20:40.160 --> 20:41.760]  the Israeli intelligence network,
[20:41.760 --> 20:43.840]  warnings in war games, the shadow government,
[20:43.840 --> 20:45.040]  and much, much more.
[20:45.040 --> 20:46.320]  Fabled Enemies.

[23:03.200 --> 23:05.240]  the struggle between freedom and fascism
[23:05.240 --> 23:06.840]  comes a story about two people
[23:06.840 --> 23:08.920]  who are faced with the challenge to stand up
[23:08.920 --> 23:10.640]  and do the right thing for liberty.
[23:10.640 --> 23:14.360]  Her face was, every face I've ever known,

[25:07.280 --> 25:10.080]  Open phones later, but I wanted to play about two minutes
[25:10.080 --> 25:16.040]  from a March 30th radio show a year and a half ago
[25:16.040 --> 25:18.600]  where a listener was asking me basically
[25:18.600 --> 25:20.600]  how this operation works.
[25:20.600 --> 25:24.000]  And I spewed it out in two minutes.
[25:24.000 --> 25:27.520]  And what do you see happening a year and a half later?
[25:27.520 --> 25:29.000]  Here you go.
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.640]  Here's how it works.
[25:31.640 --> 25:34.960]  They come into a Western nation to get a funding mechanism
[25:34.960 --> 25:38.080]  and a military enforcement arm, like England, Germany, France,
[25:38.080 --> 25:39.160]  the US.
[25:39.160 --> 25:40.240]  They come in and they lobby.
[25:40.240 --> 25:41.640]  We're going to have a great new society.
[25:41.640 --> 25:42.920]  We're going to take care of everybody.
[25:42.920 --> 25:44.600]  We're going to have welfare and build man up.
[25:44.600 --> 25:45.800]  We go, great.
[25:45.800 --> 25:47.600]  We're going to vote for big government
[25:47.600 --> 25:49.600]  and pay a lot of taxes to do this,
[25:49.600 --> 25:52.160]  because it sounds wonderful and we want to share.
[25:52.160 --> 25:54.400]  They do dole some of that out for a while.
[25:54.400 --> 25:56.200]  Some good things happen, some bad things happen.
[25:56.200 --> 25:58.760]  The point is now it's created the trough.
[25:58.760 --> 26:00.360]  Then the global corporations come in.
[26:00.360 --> 26:02.840]  They're lobbying to take over the government the whole time
[26:02.840 --> 26:06.120]  to get most of that money that's being paid in taxes given
[26:06.120 --> 26:09.400]  to them in investments, which they then take and use
[26:09.400 --> 26:12.480]  to buy off and pay off and blow out third world economies.
[26:12.480 --> 26:14.120]  They then, over the last 50 years,
[26:14.120 --> 26:15.880]  get control of the third world as a kind
[26:15.880 --> 26:19.200]  of camouflage neo-imperialism.
[26:19.200 --> 26:21.880]  They then mass that wealth, use it to totally buy off
[26:21.880 --> 26:23.040]  the western governments.
[26:23.040 --> 26:29.760]  They then basically drive up the debt of those nations.
[26:29.760 --> 26:33.440]  In debt now owed to those very private banking institutions
[26:33.440 --> 26:35.400]  and governments that were already taken over,
[26:35.400 --> 26:37.880]  in many cases, hundreds of years ago.
[26:37.880 --> 26:38.880]  See, I said this is simple.
[26:38.880 --> 26:39.680]  It's not.
[26:39.680 --> 26:42.760]  And they then take all of that wealth that they now have
[26:42.760 --> 26:45.400]  offshore where they never have to pay tax,
[26:45.400 --> 26:48.720]  but then they manipulate our government to actually raise taxes
[26:48.720 --> 26:51.840]  and toll roads and all these other ways of getting fees
[26:51.840 --> 26:54.560]  to then conduit more and more to themselves.
[26:54.560 --> 26:57.040]  And in the final phase, they come in and pay off the government
[26:57.040 --> 26:59.320]  to have the government actually write laws
[26:59.320 --> 27:02.920]  to cede government power into these multinational corporations,
[27:02.920 --> 27:05.360]  many of which are bigger than some of the largest nations
[27:05.360 --> 27:06.800]  in their GDP.
[27:06.800 --> 27:09.080]  And then they hire private intelligence agencies,
[27:09.080 --> 27:12.360]  private mercenary armies, like the beers or the diamonds.
[27:12.360 --> 27:15.000]  And so you have this world government run
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.320]  by these untouchable elites whose wealth is offshore.
[27:18.320 --> 27:20.480]  And then they basically just play nation states off
[27:20.480 --> 27:23.600]  against each other in globalization and economic warfare
[27:23.600 --> 27:25.880]  to have a domino effect to take over the next.
[27:25.880 --> 27:28.200]  And they end up truly being world rulers
[27:28.200 --> 27:30.640]  through the financial system.
[27:30.640 --> 27:34.800]  That's a pretty succinct description of that.
[27:34.800 --> 27:38.480]  All right, so, and folks, if listeners,
[27:38.480 --> 27:40.880]  I don't have the staff to do this, if listeners,
[27:40.880 --> 27:42.800]  because this is important for those out there
[27:42.800 --> 27:44.520]  that aren't aware that we're right.
[27:44.520 --> 27:46.920]  They'll just hear us today breaking down what's happening
[27:46.920 --> 27:49.000]  and telling people what's going to happen next.
[27:49.000 --> 27:50.800]  And then, you know, just chalk it up
[27:50.800 --> 27:54.480]  that we're Monday morning quarterbacking
[27:54.480 --> 27:56.960]  or backseat driving, but if people will go out
[27:56.960 --> 27:59.000]  and find the hundreds of interviews
[27:59.000 --> 28:02.000]  and hundreds of clips where I in even more detail
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.240]  lay out exactly what was going to happen.
[28:04.240 --> 28:06.160]  You can go back two and a half years ago
[28:06.160 --> 28:08.160]  when reporting live from Bilderberg,
[28:08.160 --> 28:09.560]  it's of course in end game
[28:09.560 --> 28:11.760]  and in the extras in articles we wrote,
[28:11.760 --> 28:13.960]  but it's more important even to find those radio shows
[28:13.960 --> 28:16.720]  where I lay out everything that was going to happen,
[28:16.720 --> 28:18.040]  how they were going to start the implosion
[28:18.040 --> 28:19.520]  and the subprime mortgage.
[28:19.520 --> 28:21.880]  I know that Daniel Esteland at the time
[28:21.880 --> 28:25.160]  was also on the radio show saying that from his sources
[28:25.160 --> 28:27.280]  so that we can then put this out to the public
[28:27.280 --> 28:30.560]  and say, see who could have told you two and a half years ago,
[28:30.560 --> 28:32.360]  it was all going to start in the subprime mortgages.
[28:32.360 --> 28:34.400]  Who could have told you governmental power
[28:34.400 --> 28:36.800]  was going to be given to the central banks of the world
[28:36.800 --> 28:39.180]  in a new global system.
[28:40.020 --> 28:41.600]  Now, we knew that of course in the mid 70s
[28:41.600 --> 28:43.080]  from the trilateral commission documents,
[28:43.080 --> 28:45.240]  but the point is the public doesn't read those.
[28:45.240 --> 28:47.240]  We need to educate the people.
[28:47.240 --> 28:50.720]  We need to show them that this is engineered by design.
[28:50.720 --> 28:53.880]  Now, the good news is the public predominantly now knows
[28:53.880 --> 28:55.280]  it's a staged event.
[28:55.280 --> 28:56.840]  They just don't have all the details.
[28:56.840 --> 28:58.640]  That's why you have a thousand to one phone calls
[28:58.640 --> 29:01.800]  against the banker takeover bill known as the banker bailout.
[29:01.800 --> 29:04.000]  But the problem is they didn't care.
[29:04.000 --> 29:05.240]  The White House told Congress,
[29:05.240 --> 29:07.560]  we'll just declare martial law and do it anyways.
[29:07.560 --> 29:09.320]  And the King came out on TV, remember and said,
[29:09.320 --> 29:10.840]  oh well, the White House and the Treasury
[29:10.840 --> 29:12.200]  have their own powers to do this
[29:12.200 --> 29:17.080]  and inject all this capital into the markets.
[29:18.400 --> 29:22.280]  It's just amazing to see this happening.
[29:22.280 --> 29:23.200]  All right, I'm going to come back,
[29:23.200 --> 29:24.360]  give you the latest market numbers,
[29:24.360 --> 29:28.240]  then go to William F. Engel, our guest for the next hour.
[29:28.240 --> 29:30.400]  This is the GCN radio network.
[29:30.400 --> 29:33.360]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[29:34.240 --> 29:37.360]  And we will continue to break this down.
[29:38.960 --> 29:39.800]  In fact, when we get back,
[29:39.800 --> 29:40.800]  I'm just going to briefly tell you
[29:40.800 --> 29:42.200]  what I believe is going to happen in the markets
[29:42.200 --> 29:44.040]  the next two weeks, the next month,
[29:44.040 --> 29:46.120]  the next six months, the next year.
[29:46.120 --> 29:47.520]  All right, stay with us.
[29:47.520 --> 29:48.800]  We'll be right back.
[29:50.920 --> 29:54.760]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:54.760 --> 29:57.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:00.840 --> 30:02.760]  Lead from solder and copper pipes,
[30:02.760 --> 30:04.840]  mercury from fish, dental fillings,
[30:04.840 --> 30:06.600]  vaccines, arsenic in the water.
[30:06.600 --> 30:08.800]  These heavy metal toxins are difficult
[30:08.800 --> 30:10.600]  or even impossible to avoid.
[30:10.600 --> 30:12.560]  Even trace amounts of these heavy metals
[30:12.560 --> 30:14.600]  over time can impact your health.
[30:14.600 --> 30:16.280]  Many health problems have been suggested
[30:16.280 --> 30:18.360]  as being related to this heavy metal exposure,
[30:18.360 --> 30:21.120]  including memory loss, high blood pressure, depression,
[30:21.120 --> 30:23.480]  mood swings, speech disorders, neuropathy,
[30:23.480 --> 30:26.120]  autoimmune diseases, chronic fatigue, and more.
[30:26.120 --> 30:28.360]  Unfortunately, traditional detoxifying
[30:28.360 --> 30:29.640]  isn't able to clear the body
[30:29.640 --> 30:32.320]  of these harmful and potentially deadly toxins.
[30:32.320 --> 30:34.920]  That's why there's puricleer from Ripple Creek.
[30:34.920 --> 30:37.720]  Puricleer contains a proprietary blend of ingredients,
[30:37.720 --> 30:40.760]  including a cilantro extract and alphalipoic acid,
[30:40.760 --> 30:43.120]  among other ingredients formulated specifically
[30:43.120 --> 30:44.480]  to promote body cleansing.
[30:44.480 --> 30:46.720]  Puricleer also has ingredients selected
[30:46.720 --> 30:49.560]  to promote improved circulation to enhance activity
[30:49.560 --> 30:51.960]  so that heavy metals may be more effectively captured
[30:51.960 --> 30:53.280]  and removed from the body.
[30:53.280 --> 30:58.280]  Order Puricleer now by calling Ripple Creek at 203-331-0363
[30:58.840 --> 31:01.320]  or go to RippleCreek.com.
[31:01.320 --> 31:05.560]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[31:05.560 --> 31:08.440]  In the near future, Earth is dominated
[31:08.440 --> 31:10.440]  by a powerful world government.
[31:10.440 --> 31:13.280]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[31:13.280 --> 31:16.080]  Could their objective be world domination?
[31:16.080 --> 31:19.160]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[31:19.160 --> 31:22.120]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[31:22.120 --> 31:26.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity
[31:26.000 --> 31:26.840]  is at hand.
[31:29.640 --> 31:31.360]  For the first time in history,
[31:31.360 --> 31:35.040]  the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[31:35.040 --> 31:36.160]  You will learn the secret
[31:36.160 --> 31:38.920]  that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[31:38.920 --> 31:41.480]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[31:41.480 --> 31:42.640]  Most people have no idea.
[31:42.640 --> 31:43.480]  They're not after money.
[31:43.480 --> 31:44.720]  They have all the money they need.
[31:44.720 --> 31:45.680]  They're after power.
[31:45.680 --> 31:46.760]  That's their afternoon.

[31:58.360 --> 31:59.760]  You have been warned.
[32:00.720 --> 32:02.840]  Hi, gasoline prices got you down.
[32:02.840 --> 32:05.800]  Is your vehicle not getting the mileage it used to?
[32:05.800 --> 32:08.240]  Poor quality gasoline and the addition of ethanol
[32:08.240 --> 32:11.400]  plugs your fuel injectors and slowly robs fuel economy.
[32:11.400 --> 32:15.040]  Mechanics charge up to $300 to clean your fuel system.

[32:56.280 --> 32:59.680]  That's 888-873-7371.
[32:59.680 --> 33:02.760]  After World War II, the private banking families
[33:02.760 --> 33:04.720]  that own the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England,
[33:04.720 --> 33:07.080]  the British Empire, via stealth,
[33:07.080 --> 33:11.080]  according to Carol Quigley and of course, Seasal Rhodes
[33:11.080 --> 33:13.280]  and others, Lord Milner, who set all this up.
[33:13.280 --> 33:16.280]  Quigley just reported on it as their official historian.
[33:16.280 --> 33:19.560]  They needed the OECD to become a member of the United States
[33:19.560 --> 33:21.440]  and to be able to make a living
[33:21.440 --> 33:23.280]  in the United States of America.
[33:23.280 --> 33:25.280]  And they were able to make a living
[33:25.280 --> 33:27.120]  in the United States of America.
[33:27.120 --> 33:31.440]  They needed the OECD to become a global banking system
[33:31.440 --> 33:33.360]  so there are, quote, no safe havens.
[33:33.360 --> 33:36.160]  So one country doesn't have more fractional reserve banking
[33:36.160 --> 33:37.000]  than the other.
[33:37.000 --> 33:39.280]  One nation doesn't have lower taxes than the other.
[33:39.280 --> 33:42.120]  So that, quote, investment and money doesn't flee.
[33:42.120 --> 33:43.960]  That's a big part of the New World Order.
[33:43.960 --> 33:45.920]  Also, they can then have a double set of rules.
[33:45.920 --> 33:47.640]  The inner elite can do whatever they want.
[33:47.640 --> 33:51.160]  The general public are surveilled slaves.
[33:51.160 --> 33:54.440]  And that's why right now they have the private banking
[33:54.440 --> 33:57.960]  families, less than 20 families that own most of the stock
[33:57.960 --> 34:00.840]  in the private central banks, trying to unify things.
[34:00.840 --> 34:04.320]  There are some splits, though, at least on the surface.
[34:04.320 --> 34:06.800]  And we're gonna be discussing that.
[34:06.800 --> 34:11.280]  Remember last week, I predicted that the stock market would,
[34:11.280 --> 34:13.600]  in the next few weeks, rise up a little bit
[34:13.600 --> 34:17.320]  but not gain everything that it lost.
[34:17.320 --> 34:19.480]  That's why they sell the public.
[34:19.480 --> 34:22.480]  That's why they sell the public on OECD,
[34:22.480 --> 34:25.080]  pumping all this money and evaluating the dollar.
[34:25.080 --> 34:26.040]  That's a good thing.
[34:26.040 --> 34:28.160]  And then down the road, they know our memories
[34:28.160 --> 34:29.000]  are very short.
[34:29.000 --> 34:30.560]  Remember a year ago, they pumped in hundreds of billions
[34:30.560 --> 34:31.400]  and said that would fix it.
[34:31.400 --> 34:33.120]  And then six months ago, hundreds of billions.
[34:33.120 --> 34:34.360]  Then a month ago, hundreds of billions
[34:34.360 --> 34:36.480]  and unlimited power they've given themselves.
[34:36.480 --> 34:37.600]  And always it's gonna be okay.
[34:37.600 --> 34:39.420]  And then they plunge it down even further,
[34:39.420 --> 34:41.960]  training the public that when the market finally
[34:41.960 --> 34:44.960]  really falls, and I'm talking down to, you know,
[34:44.960 --> 34:49.000]  three, 4,000 points, the suckers,
[34:49.000 --> 34:50.560]  the mom and pops will stay in.
[34:50.560 --> 34:52.760]  Meanwhile, the elites for five years have been moving
[34:52.760 --> 34:56.720]  out of the stock market, moving into raw materials,
[34:56.720 --> 35:01.720]  moving into infrastructure, moving into commodities.
[35:02.640 --> 35:04.640]  And then in their own financial publications,
[35:04.640 --> 35:06.400]  like the Financial Times of London a year and a half ago,
[35:06.400 --> 35:08.100]  they said the question is, can the elite
[35:08.100 --> 35:11.000]  have an organized gradual implosion
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.960]  into third world serfdom for the planet with them ruling it?
[35:13.960 --> 35:16.440]  Or have they created a debt black hole so big
[35:16.440 --> 35:18.440]  it may even destroy them?
[35:18.440 --> 35:19.720]  So that's the issue here.
[35:19.720 --> 35:24.200]  William F. Engdahl, author, researcher, journalist,
[35:24.200 --> 35:26.440]  joins us from Germany.
[35:26.440 --> 35:29.000]  And we really appreciate him coming on with us
[35:29.000 --> 35:30.680]  as a great record of predicting things
[35:30.680 --> 35:34.880]  and a multifaceted understanding of this whole global system.
[35:34.880 --> 35:35.720]  And later in the interview,
[35:35.720 --> 35:37.480]  we'll get into the overall eugenics plan.
[35:37.480 --> 35:38.920]  We had him on a few weeks ago covering that,
[35:38.920 --> 35:40.360]  but ran out of time.
[35:40.360 --> 35:41.520]  But we're gonna go ahead right now
[35:41.520 --> 35:43.240]  and break down what's currently happening
[35:43.240 --> 35:47.760]  and who he believes is behind this implosion.
[35:47.760 --> 35:49.800]  Mr. Engdahl, thanks for coming on with us.
[35:49.800 --> 35:51.600]  Well, thank you for having me again, Alex.
[35:51.600 --> 35:52.800]  You bet, it's good to have you here.
[35:52.800 --> 35:54.320]  Okay, well, what's happening?
[35:55.320 --> 35:56.680]  What I see going on,
[35:56.680 --> 35:59.720]  and this I wrote about three and a half years ago already,
[35:59.720 --> 36:03.640]  there was too much deliberate support of this
[36:03.640 --> 36:05.840]  from the get go by Alan Greenspan
[36:05.840 --> 36:07.720]  when he was chairman of the Fed.
[36:07.720 --> 36:12.040]  Of course, the Federal Reserve is the traffic cop
[36:12.040 --> 36:14.800]  for the US financial system,
[36:14.800 --> 36:18.320]  the largest in the world in the post war period.
[36:18.320 --> 36:21.920]  The traffic cop, and he represents the overall interests
[36:21.920 --> 36:24.080]  of the financial sector as a whole
[36:24.080 --> 36:27.400]  so that no one member gets too far out of line
[36:27.400 --> 36:30.040]  and destroys it for the others.
[36:30.040 --> 36:34.040]  However, Greenspan backed this securitization revolution
[36:34.040 --> 36:38.160]  from the early years of this decade.
[36:38.160 --> 36:40.520]  And speech after speech, he promoted it.
[36:40.520 --> 36:42.760]  He did everything in his power
[36:42.760 --> 36:46.680]  to support the repeal of Glass-Steagall in 99
[36:46.680 --> 36:51.080]  when Clinton signed the law that Phil Graham
[36:51.080 --> 36:53.160]  and others drafted.
[36:53.160 --> 36:57.560]  And the New York banks after that went on a rampage,
[36:57.560 --> 37:02.560]  just securitizing everything that moved ultimately.
[37:04.040 --> 37:08.640]  Now, what's emerged with the bringing down of Henry Paulson
[37:08.640 --> 37:13.560]  to become Secretary of Treasury in 2006
[37:13.560 --> 37:18.560]  is an operation that is being run to all intents and purposes
[37:18.960 --> 37:22.680]  from top to bottom by a tight knit network
[37:22.680 --> 37:24.880]  that has the name Goldman Sachs alumni.
[37:25.760 --> 37:29.880]  Not only is Paulson the former CEO of Goldman Sachs,
[37:29.880 --> 37:34.880]  the 35 year old chap that he chose to administer
[37:35.600 --> 37:38.560]  the largest fund in the history of world capitalism,
[37:38.560 --> 37:40.960]  the $700 billion plus fund
[37:40.960 --> 37:44.560]  that he's just been voted by a labile Congress,
[37:44.560 --> 37:47.120]  terrified out of their wits, maybe,
[37:47.120 --> 37:51.040]  is a man who came from, guess where, Goldman Sachs.
[37:51.040 --> 37:56.040]  His name is of all things cash carry, like cash and carry.
[37:57.760 --> 38:00.440]  You pay up the cash, Mr. Taxpayer,
[38:00.440 --> 38:02.440]  and I'll carry it right up to Wall Street.
[38:02.440 --> 38:04.640]  And I don't normally judge a book by its cover,
[38:04.640 --> 38:07.400]  but he comes right out of Dr. Dinn
[38:07.400 --> 38:10.120]  or lacks Luther, a central casting.
[38:10.120 --> 38:12.880]  Yeah, well, that may be also,
[38:12.880 --> 38:17.760]  but the fact that a 35 year old
[38:17.760 --> 38:21.440]  relatively unexperienced Wall Street man
[38:21.440 --> 38:24.600]  is drafting the most complicated bailout
[38:24.600 --> 38:27.200]  to package in financial history
[38:27.200 --> 38:31.560]  is a lone reason to be suspect, the response in Europe.
[38:31.560 --> 38:32.840]  Well, we know he isn't.
[38:32.840 --> 38:35.800]  We know Paulson can't, quote, run it himself,
[38:35.800 --> 38:39.040]  and he has his favorite deputy who,
[38:39.040 --> 38:41.240]  according to the press, for years,
[38:41.240 --> 38:43.960]  is always at his side in his personal legged,
[38:43.960 --> 38:45.560]  his personal gopher.
[38:45.560 --> 38:50.560]  Okay, there's probably a much nastier story behind that,
[38:52.840 --> 38:56.040]  but the details are yet to come fully out.
[38:56.040 --> 38:58.280]  I'm sure we'll get them in the course of time.
[38:58.280 --> 39:03.280]  But the way that this series of crises was run
[39:03.280 --> 39:06.080]  stinks to high heaven of an engineered job.
[39:06.080 --> 39:09.240]  And I think the tip off to the whole thing
[39:09.240 --> 39:12.000]  was the testimony of Richard Fould,
[39:12.000 --> 39:17.000]  the failed chairman of Lehman Brothers,
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.680]  where the congressman chose to focus on
[39:19.680 --> 39:23.000]  how much bonus pay Richard Fould got over the last 10 years,
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.120]  which was a red herring and a half,
[39:25.120 --> 39:28.360]  and not to focus on why it was that
[39:28.360 --> 39:31.800]  only one financial institution of a major size
[39:31.800 --> 39:34.040]  was allowed by Paulson to go under,
[39:34.040 --> 39:35.480]  and that was Lehman Brothers.
[39:35.480 --> 39:40.480]  The entire subsequent financial tsunami, as I call it,
[39:40.480 --> 39:42.080]  that was unleashed around the world,
[39:42.080 --> 39:45.280]  from Japanese banks to European banks and so forth,
[39:45.280 --> 39:48.680]  goes directly back to the letting go of Lehman Brothers
[39:48.680 --> 39:50.880]  that the government didn't bail it out.
[39:50.880 --> 39:52.880]  At the same time, they were bailing out
[39:52.880 --> 39:57.880]  in a private meeting with the chairman of Goldman Sachs
[39:57.880 --> 40:01.480]  and the heads of AIG and the New York Times
[40:01.480 --> 40:05.480]  and the New York Fed, and Paulson, they bailed out AIG.
[40:05.480 --> 40:06.680]  That's right, they're not stupid.
[40:06.680 --> 40:08.800]  When they run around talking about depression,
[40:08.800 --> 40:10.080]  they know that's gonna kill markets.
[40:10.080 --> 40:12.480]  When they let the first big one go under,
[40:12.480 --> 40:13.640]  they knew what was gonna happen.
[40:13.640 --> 40:15.400]  They allowed this to unfold.
[40:15.400 --> 40:17.400]  Yes, absolutely clear to me.
[40:17.400 --> 40:19.800]  And what they're trying to do in all this
[40:20.800 --> 40:23.960]  unwinding of hedge fund positions in the stock market
[40:23.960 --> 40:27.040]  is really an epiphenomenon to the whole process,
[40:27.040 --> 40:29.960]  but it gathers headlines and scares people to death
[40:29.960 --> 40:32.360]  so that they vote up legislation and powers
[40:32.360 --> 40:34.960]  that if, well, it's the financial equivalent
[40:34.960 --> 40:37.480]  of Homeland Security or Patriot Act
[40:37.480 --> 40:39.600]  is what Paulson got in this new legislation.
[40:39.600 --> 40:40.960]  Financial dictatorship.
[40:42.960 --> 40:45.400]  It's certainly going down that road
[40:45.400 --> 40:47.880]  if the Congress continues to allow it.
[40:50.200 --> 40:55.200]  But what I think is going on is that Paulson and company,
[40:55.200 --> 40:59.120]  let's call it the Cabal or the Cronies,
[40:59.120 --> 41:01.320]  they thought that through this,
[41:01.320 --> 41:04.280]  they could terrify the European governments
[41:04.280 --> 41:09.280]  into falling in line and agreeing to a de facto next step
[41:09.280 --> 41:11.760]  in a global money arrangement that would be,
[41:11.760 --> 41:13.560]  as Kissinger said back in the 70s,
[41:13.560 --> 41:16.080]  you control oil, you control all nations,
[41:16.080 --> 41:17.960]  control food, you control the people,
[41:17.960 --> 41:20.160]  you control money, you control the whole world.
[41:20.160 --> 41:22.280]  And that is where this,
[41:22.280 --> 41:25.320]  a lead has been trying to push things since Bretton Woods
[41:25.320 --> 41:26.640]  in 1944.
[41:26.640 --> 41:29.080]  I think personally, as things look now,
[41:29.080 --> 41:31.560]  and I'm subject to change on this, is everybody,
[41:31.560 --> 41:34.760]  but I think personally, they've gone a bridge too far
[41:34.760 --> 41:38.160]  in this securitization debacle and the way it's unfolded.
[41:38.160 --> 41:42.520]  The Bundesbank, the central bank of Germany,
[41:42.520 --> 41:45.240]  a bank that was reckoned to be out of business
[41:45.240 --> 41:48.960]  about 10 years ago, the new head of the Bundesbank,
[41:48.960 --> 41:52.720]  Alex Weber, it turns out to be a very, very tough-minded
[41:52.720 --> 41:56.080]  individual who understands the basics about banking
[41:56.080 --> 41:57.840]  and the economy.
[41:57.840 --> 42:00.080]  And he said, look, this Paulson plan is a bailout
[42:00.080 --> 42:02.680]  for the financial system, and I'm not gonna allow that.
[42:02.680 --> 42:06.160]  He told the German Chancellor and the German Finance Minister,
[42:06.160 --> 42:08.840]  we have to take equity stakes in the banks
[42:08.840 --> 42:12.320]  and control how they run so that they're not proliferating
[42:12.320 --> 42:14.840]  more of these toxic waste experiments.
[42:14.840 --> 42:17.360]  And that was in constant control.
[42:17.360 --> 42:22.360]  And that was in contrast to the approach of Sarkozy,
[42:22.600 --> 42:25.320]  the President of France, and of course, Berlusconi,
[42:25.320 --> 42:30.320]  the billionaire, rather unsavory Prime Minister of Italy
[42:31.680 --> 42:34.360]  who wants German taxpayer monies to bail out
[42:34.360 --> 42:35.200]  and solve into tiny banks.
[42:35.200 --> 42:37.600]  Yeah, the former president, a fascist now.
[42:39.560 --> 42:42.120]  So that's one set that some of Europe wants
[42:42.120 --> 42:45.800]  on the other side to detail the financial architecture
[42:45.800 --> 42:48.320]  that Goldman Sachs, as the receivership
[42:48.320 --> 42:52.840]  for the Anglo-American side, they want specifically
[42:52.840 --> 42:55.200]  to be able to use their regulators and use public money
[42:55.200 --> 42:57.160]  to go in and take over banks.
[42:57.160 --> 42:59.720]  So when we hear that it's a nationalization,
[42:59.720 --> 43:01.280]  here it's really a reverse of that.
[43:01.280 --> 43:04.520]  It's a private intergroup acting as government
[43:04.520 --> 43:08.320]  with a sort of privatization of select areas
[43:08.320 --> 43:11.080]  of the financial system they want at the expense,
[43:11.080 --> 43:12.880]  not just of Main Street and the people,
[43:12.880 --> 43:14.840]  but of the rest of the financial sector.
[43:14.840 --> 43:17.920]  Yeah, it's the British East India Company model,
[43:19.040 --> 43:21.040]  the people who ran the opium wars against China
[43:21.040 --> 43:24.720]  in the 1840s, and the public pays the cost,
[43:24.720 --> 43:26.960]  they bear the risk, they finance the armies
[43:26.960 --> 43:29.720]  to enforce the territorial grabs
[43:29.720 --> 43:31.600]  of the East India Company, and that's exactly
[43:31.600 --> 43:35.160]  what Paulson is doing with this tight cabal that's emerging.
[43:35.160 --> 43:38.240]  The winners are, I guess, surprise, surprise,
[43:38.240 --> 43:41.480]  is Citigroup, one of the most insolvent banks in the world.
[43:41.480 --> 43:44.000]  JPMorgan Chase, who has more derivatives,
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.600]  probably than any other bank on the face of the earth,
[43:46.600 --> 43:50.320]  and JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs.
[43:50.320 --> 43:52.640]  Those three, these are the giants that are gonna emerge,
[43:52.640 --> 43:57.440]  and as you point out, Alex, the standard and pours,
[43:57.440 --> 44:01.920]  Moody's Investors Service, the rating agencies
[44:01.920 --> 44:04.640]  who ought to be in the docket in Congress
[44:04.640 --> 44:09.120]  and facing jail terms for the criminal misbehavior
[44:09.120 --> 44:12.480]  that they're complicit in by some estimates.
[44:12.480 --> 44:17.480]  The entire regulatory system, the SEC,
[44:17.680 --> 44:22.120]  the, right up and down the line, is all being retooled
[44:22.120 --> 44:26.520]  into a leaner and meaner group of global giants
[44:26.520 --> 44:29.080]  that's gonna try to continue this.
[44:29.080 --> 44:33.560]  I think, however, that they have miscalculated,
[44:33.560 --> 44:37.600]  they're the elites, the elites who...
[44:37.600 --> 44:39.640]  Have bitten off more than they can chew.
[44:39.640 --> 44:43.680]  I think so, I think so, that's my sense on it,
[44:43.680 --> 44:47.440]  that the world isn't this time falling in lockstep,
[44:47.440 --> 44:50.120]  that you can control a country, that's possible,
[44:50.120 --> 44:53.120]  I can admit that, Hitler did it in Germany,
[44:53.120 --> 44:57.400]  Mussolini in Italy, many ten-part dictators
[44:57.400 --> 45:01.000]  have come up over the centuries and done that for a period,
[45:01.000 --> 45:04.880]  but only a period, but you can't control the entire world.
[45:04.880 --> 45:06.280]  And I think the old adage,
[45:06.280 --> 45:08.320]  whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad.
[45:08.320 --> 45:10.960]  Well, I think there's some pretty mad people
[45:10.960 --> 45:13.040]  running on the loose in Washington these days
[45:13.040 --> 45:16.840]  who probably ought to be institutionalized
[45:16.840 --> 45:19.040]  for their own good and their own, the good of the world.
[45:19.040 --> 45:21.560]  Well, there's certainly a lot of hubris going on,
[45:21.560 --> 45:25.160]  and I think that's illustrated by Kashkari,
[45:25.160 --> 45:29.080]  the 35-year-old special friend of Hank Paulson,
[45:29.080 --> 45:30.640]  who literally is always at his side,
[45:30.640 --> 45:32.800]  I thought he was Secret Service the last two years,
[45:32.800 --> 45:37.120]  he's literally always at the side of his lord,
[45:37.120 --> 45:39.560]  there, Mr. Paulson, I mean,
[45:39.560 --> 45:42.200]  they could have gotten somebody else from outside,
[45:42.200 --> 45:44.680]  Goldman Sachs, who was still part of their inner crew,
[45:44.680 --> 45:47.520]  but they didn't, because they don't care,
[45:47.520 --> 45:50.640]  the hubris is just oozing out of their pores.
[45:50.640 --> 45:53.040]  Yeah, yeah, they think they're the gods of Marvel Olympus,
[45:53.040 --> 45:56.560]  and they don't need to bother about what the commoners think.
[45:57.960 --> 46:01.880]  But you know, Paulson has an interesting political career,
[46:01.880 --> 46:06.640]  he's cut his political teeth under a man named John Ehrlichman
[46:06.640 --> 46:08.080]  in the Nixon White House,
[46:08.080 --> 46:12.360]  you know, the guy who ran the whole Watergate operation,
[46:12.360 --> 46:13.200]  the Plumber's Unit,
[46:13.200 --> 46:15.600]  and talked about letting people hang
[46:15.600 --> 46:16.960]  until they twist in the wind.
[46:16.960 --> 46:18.600]  Yes, an intelligence operation.
[46:20.720 --> 46:25.320]  And Paulson managed to get out of that unscathed,
[46:25.320 --> 46:28.440]  and start his career at Goldman Sachs,
[46:28.440 --> 46:33.080]  and now he's running the financial power
[46:33.080 --> 46:36.360]  of the privatized US financial system
[46:36.360 --> 46:41.360]  with open government check, without any checks and balances.
[46:41.920 --> 46:43.480]  We're talking to William F. Engdahl,
[46:43.480 --> 46:46.200]  William, plug some of your books in your website.
[46:46.200 --> 46:49.720]  Well, a lot of this financial history
[46:49.720 --> 46:51.880]  is actually taken up in the book,
[46:51.880 --> 46:53.320]  a lot of people think it's an oil book,
[46:53.320 --> 46:55.880]  but it's not, it's a book about geopolitics
[46:55.880 --> 46:57.640]  in the history of the last century called
[46:57.640 --> 47:00.160]  a Century of War Anglo-American Oil Politics
[47:00.160 --> 47:01.800]  in the New World Order,
[47:01.800 --> 47:03.520]  where I go into that interface
[47:03.520 --> 47:06.480]  between banking, oil, energy control,
[47:06.480 --> 47:10.960]  and the military control of the Anglo-American elites
[47:10.960 --> 47:13.040]  over the past 100 years,
[47:13.040 --> 47:15.800]  a Century of War Anglo-American Oil Politics.
[47:15.800 --> 47:19.800]  The second book I've done and published
[47:19.800 --> 47:22.040]  is a part of a trilogy,
[47:22.040 --> 47:24.640]  keys off of the famous quote that I mentioned earlier
[47:24.640 --> 47:27.120]  from Henry Kissinger back in the 70s,
[47:27.120 --> 47:30.400]  control of oil, you control whole nations or regions,
[47:30.400 --> 47:33.040]  control of food, you control the people,
[47:33.040 --> 47:37.520]  and that's a book about genetically modified organisms, GMO,
[47:37.520 --> 47:41.320]  and the fact that the entire project of agribusiness
[47:41.320 --> 47:44.520]  that was started at Harvard Business School in the 1950s
[47:44.520 --> 47:46.960]  with money from the Rockefeller Foundation
[47:46.960 --> 47:48.840]  links into the project of GMO.
[47:48.840 --> 47:50.920]  It's about controlling the seeds
[47:50.920 --> 47:53.120]  for the human food chain on this planet
[47:53.120 --> 47:55.360]  so that certain elites can decide
[47:55.360 --> 48:00.360]  which races they want to systematically call.
[48:00.360 --> 48:02.720]  And the incredible part is it's all on record.
[48:02.720 --> 48:04.040]  Fire out your website.
[48:04.040 --> 48:07.960]  Yeah, it's www.angdahlgeopolitics,
[48:07.960 --> 48:12.960]  one word, E-N-G-D-A-H-L-G-E-O-P-O-L-I-T-I-C-S,
[48:13.840 --> 48:15.520]  the period between the two,
[48:15.520 --> 48:19.600]  angdahl.oilgeopolitics.net.
[48:19.600 --> 48:23.600]  Or just Google William Engdahl, E-N-G-I-N-F-O-L-I-M-A-N-G-O-L
[48:23.600 --> 48:25.920]  on the Google and you'll get it right away.
[48:25.920 --> 48:27.840]  We're about to break, but literally,
[48:27.840 --> 48:30.560]  humans act the same, elites behave the same,
[48:30.560 --> 48:31.920]  just on a wider scale today.
[48:31.920 --> 48:34.680]  He that knows the past, knows the present
[48:34.680 --> 48:36.600]  and can look into the future.
[48:36.600 --> 48:37.440]  And that's what we do here.
[48:37.440 --> 48:39.240]  We tie everything together with the past,
[48:39.240 --> 48:42.200]  the present, and the future as anybody trying
[48:42.200 --> 48:44.320]  to project the lines and articulate
[48:44.320 --> 48:46.760]  where things are going and people that ignore that
[48:46.760 --> 48:47.960]  do it at their own peril.
[48:47.960 --> 48:50.480]  In a couple of minutes we've got left before break.
[48:50.480 --> 48:52.680]  Separately, I guess I've read some of your papers
[48:52.680 --> 48:53.600]  but hadn't read your book.
[48:53.600 --> 48:55.680]  Separately I can have you on or so many other guests
[48:55.680 --> 48:56.760]  who don't even know each other.
[48:56.760 --> 48:57.960]  We articulate the same thing
[48:57.960 --> 48:59.760]  about the Anglo-American establishment,
[48:59.760 --> 49:02.560]  even people on the enemy side who are fans of this,
[49:02.560 --> 49:05.280]  you know, admit what they've done in many books.
[49:05.280 --> 49:07.480]  This Anglo-American establishment,
[49:07.480 --> 49:09.280]  the Dutch and the British East India Company,
[49:09.280 --> 49:12.160]  the later emerging, you know, all of this,
[49:12.160 --> 49:15.160]  the way they went into India created black markets
[49:15.160 --> 49:16.560]  to corrupt the local authorities,
[49:16.560 --> 49:18.000]  to play them off against each other,
[49:18.000 --> 49:22.560]  to create crime as a pretext to bring in imperial police,
[49:22.560 --> 49:26.200]  breaking up China 150 years ago into 10 or 11 parts
[49:26.200 --> 49:28.720]  by bringing in opium, taking control of the police
[49:28.720 --> 49:32.520]  and the gangs, you look at the US with the phony drug war,
[49:32.520 --> 49:34.320]  then the stage terror attacks,
[49:34.320 --> 49:37.240]  then the economic collapse, they do the same thing,
[49:37.240 --> 49:38.880]  they have handbooks on it,
[49:38.880 --> 49:41.160]  and they're doing it now to the West
[49:41.160 --> 49:42.640]  and they're not playing games.
[49:42.640 --> 49:47.040]  This is a systematic British imperial stratagem
[49:47.040 --> 49:51.720]  of bringing down nations and then putting in imperial fronts.
[49:52.720 --> 49:56.280]  So let's give people, you know, that snapshot,
[49:56.280 --> 49:57.400]  because I probably read 20 books
[49:57.400 --> 49:58.920]  on the British East India Company,
[49:58.920 --> 50:00.960]  it's also thrilling that I'm literally,
[50:00.960 --> 50:02.320]  you know, that's the one area of history,
[50:02.320 --> 50:04.880]  I've really studied, you know, that and British naval history,
[50:04.880 --> 50:06.440]  you can't put it down.
[50:06.440 --> 50:08.160]  So let's talk now and come back from break
[50:08.160 --> 50:11.280]  about the stratagem, taking down the Chinese,
[50:11.280 --> 50:14.440]  taking down India that's been exported to hundreds of nations.
[50:14.440 --> 50:15.560]  Yeah, we'll do.
[50:16.640 --> 50:17.960]  Let's go ahead and start now and we'll go to break
[50:17.960 --> 50:18.840]  and then we'll come back.
[50:18.840 --> 50:21.800]  Okay, well, as you point out, Alex,
[50:21.800 --> 50:24.840]  the East India model, and I've studied quite a bit
[50:24.840 --> 50:27.000]  about that historically, I'm an economic historian
[50:27.000 --> 50:32.000]  by concentration, and that model is really
[50:33.600 --> 50:35.640]  more and more the model of what emerged
[50:35.640 --> 50:39.000]  in the United States after the 1960s and the 1970s.
[50:39.000 --> 50:42.400]  So the American elite studied their British cousins
[50:42.400 --> 50:45.000]  very, very closely and realized this is the way to go.
[50:46.440 --> 50:49.360]  We get back, William F. Engdahl, our guest,
[50:49.360 --> 50:51.280]  we'll break that down, then we'll get into
[50:51.280 --> 50:53.480]  where he thinks these markets are going in the future,
[50:53.480 --> 50:56.360]  part of this plan, how he thinks this fissure
[50:56.360 --> 50:59.440]  and the elite is gonna play out with our guest.
[51:01.800 --> 51:03.960]  Attention, this is an extremely urgent
[51:03.960 --> 51:05.640]  self-reliant news bulletin.
[51:05.640 --> 51:07.440]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own

[51:09.240 --> 51:11.320]  this is going to be the most important message
[51:11.320 --> 51:12.760]  you will ever hear.
[51:12.760 --> 51:14.240]  Here is why.
[51:14.240 --> 51:16.760]  This network has just learned of a new video course
[51:16.760 --> 51:19.120]  that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare
[51:19.120 --> 51:21.160]  and store all types of survival foods
[51:21.160 --> 51:23.440]  in an event of social unrest and food shortages
[51:23.440 --> 51:24.680]  here in the US.
[51:24.680 --> 51:27.400]  Brain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[51:27.400 --> 51:30.480]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the US this fall?
[51:30.480 --> 51:32.800]  Don't wait, learn the food shortage skills
[51:32.800 --> 51:35.360]  that can keep you and your family alive in a crisis.

[52:01.240 --> 52:04.480]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[52:04.480 --> 52:08.000]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[52:08.000 --> 52:10.640]  The enemies struck America on September 11.
[52:10.640 --> 52:12.200]  But who is the enemy?
[52:12.200 --> 52:13.000]  Ben Laden.
[52:13.000 --> 52:14.000]  This is his MO.
[52:14.000 --> 52:15.320]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[52:15.320 --> 52:17.360]  We have to look to the Psalm of Ben Laden.
[52:17.360 --> 52:19.400]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film
[52:19.400 --> 52:22.080]  to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[52:22.080 --> 52:24.440]  networks inside the United States.
[52:24.440 --> 52:26.880]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis,
[52:26.880 --> 52:31.280]  again, very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[52:31.280 --> 52:35.080]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[52:35.080 --> 52:36.920]  Ben Laden's connections to the CIA,
[52:36.920 --> 52:40.320]  the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[52:40.320 --> 52:43.120]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games,
[52:43.120 --> 52:45.240]  the shadow government, and much, much more.

[53:24.920 --> 53:29.440]  The RFID tags and ID cards have been proven to be not secure.

[53:33.760 --> 53:37.640]  RFID blocker is available as a wallet or passport case.

[54:01.720 --> 54:05.400]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[54:05.400 --> 54:10.040]  The Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[54:10.040 --> 54:16.560]  Journalist, journalist, economic, historian, author,
[54:16.560 --> 54:19.160]  William F. Hingdahl is our guest.
[54:19.160 --> 54:23.680]  OK, William, for people that are tuning in, I want to repeat.
[54:23.680 --> 54:25.840]  Why do you care about how the British Empire controlled
[54:25.840 --> 54:26.920]  India?
[54:26.920 --> 54:29.080]  Why do you care about how Europe, England, and the United
[54:29.080 --> 54:30.520]  States took down China?
[54:30.520 --> 54:33.520]  Because they're doing the exact same thing.
[54:33.520 --> 54:36.560]  This is a plan, and we have the recent documents out
[54:36.560 --> 54:38.440]  of the IMF World Bank, Trial Lateral Commission,
[54:38.440 --> 54:39.320]  Club of Rome.
[54:39.320 --> 54:41.240]  They are singing from the same sheet of music.
[54:41.240 --> 54:43.080]  Continue, sir.
[54:43.080 --> 54:45.120]  Well, basically the East India model,
[54:45.120 --> 54:48.240]  let's take the opium wars in the 1840s.
[54:48.240 --> 54:55.160]  The British trading families back home in London,
[54:55.160 --> 54:57.840]  the ones who owned stock in the East India company that
[54:57.840 --> 55:05.280]  ran India during the early 1800s and the century before that,
[55:05.280 --> 55:10.560]  they essentially used opium as a way
[55:10.560 --> 55:13.720]  to bust open the resistance of the Chinese emperor
[55:13.720 --> 55:16.360]  to free trade with the British.
[55:16.360 --> 55:18.200]  And the Americans got in that.
[55:18.200 --> 55:21.720]  Some of the oldest, most distinguished families
[55:21.720 --> 55:26.320]  of Boston and New England were running opium ships parallel
[55:26.320 --> 55:31.000]  with the British into China in the 1840s.
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.760]  And they used bribery.
[55:33.760 --> 55:37.920]  They used corruption of customs officials, military people.
[55:37.920 --> 55:41.880]  They got most of the people along the coastal cities
[55:41.880 --> 55:45.440]  from Canton and so forth hooked on opium.
[55:45.440 --> 55:47.200]  And once they got hooked on opium,
[55:47.200 --> 55:50.320]  of course, the fighting spirit of your army,
[55:50.320 --> 55:55.160]  if your leading officers are opium addicts,
[55:55.160 --> 55:56.720]  you've got a pretty bad army.
[55:56.720 --> 55:58.360]  And that's exactly what happened.
[55:58.360 --> 56:02.040]  Then this private company, the East India company,
[56:02.040 --> 56:06.640]  engineered an incident where a British ship was shot on.
[56:06.640 --> 56:08.600]  They used a provocation.
[56:08.600 --> 56:10.640]  And then they called back home to London.
[56:10.640 --> 56:13.520]  In fact, Jardine and Matheson actually
[56:13.520 --> 56:17.840]  went from India back to London and started agitation
[56:17.840 --> 56:20.480]  with their friends in the controlled British media
[56:20.480 --> 56:23.520]  about how the Chinese are violating the sovereignty
[56:23.520 --> 56:26.040]  of English ships at sea and so forth
[56:26.040 --> 56:27.640]  and have to be taught a lesson.
[56:27.640 --> 56:30.920]  So the British Royal Navy, the government came in
[56:30.920 --> 56:33.800]  and not only bailed out this private company,
[56:33.800 --> 56:37.160]  the East India Company, 60 million Chinese
[56:37.160 --> 56:40.760]  by the end of the 1860s who were identified
[56:40.760 --> 56:43.360]  and estimated as opium addicts
[56:43.360 --> 56:45.640]  because of the East India Company assault on China.
[56:45.640 --> 56:49.840]  To this day, the Chinese still have a traumatic shock,
[56:49.840 --> 56:52.360]  a cultural shock over this experience.
[56:52.360 --> 56:53.200]  So...
[56:53.200 --> 56:56.560]  And the phony drug war was used to corrupt the police region
[56:56.560 --> 56:59.640]  by region, to get them on the payroll.
[56:59.640 --> 57:03.520]  Again, by creating a black market which they controlled,
[57:03.520 --> 57:05.760]  they were able to take over the nation.
[57:05.760 --> 57:08.520]  Yeah, well they, and if this sounds a little bit
[57:08.520 --> 57:12.720]  like Miami Vice, I think it's purely intentional
[57:12.720 --> 57:14.160]  because as you pointed out,
[57:14.160 --> 57:18.680]  go back to one of my favorite books about the Vietnam era
[57:18.680 --> 57:21.440]  is called The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia
[57:21.440 --> 57:23.440]  by Alfred McCoy.
[57:23.440 --> 57:26.240]  And he actually put together the documentation
[57:26.240 --> 57:29.080]  so forth about how the CIA, Air America,
[57:29.080 --> 57:32.680]  Nugent Hand Bank in Australia were absolutely up
[57:32.680 --> 57:37.680]  to their ears in running narcotics out of Vietnam
[57:38.360 --> 57:41.360]  into the West to get money for various black bag operations
[57:41.360 --> 57:42.920]  that they were doing off budget.
[57:42.920 --> 57:45.040]  Well, what happened parallel with that?
[57:45.040 --> 57:47.360]  The United States in the ghettos
[57:47.360 --> 57:51.480]  in the Hispanic and black neighborhoods all over America,
[57:51.480 --> 57:54.520]  you have an explosion of drug addiction,
[57:54.520 --> 57:56.040]  flooding the country with drugs.
[57:56.040 --> 57:59.400]  And then the next wave came out of Columbia.
[57:59.400 --> 58:01.240]  Crack cocaine in the 1980s.
[58:01.240 --> 58:02.520]  The CIA, yeah.
[58:02.520 --> 58:03.480]  Yeah, yeah.
[58:03.480 --> 58:05.880]  And yeah, it was documented in the series
[58:05.880 --> 58:09.440]  in the Los Angeles press about eight or 10 years ago
[58:09.440 --> 58:12.760]  that the CIA was up to their ears in that one.
[58:12.760 --> 58:15.560]  Well, Oliver North and the whole business
[58:15.560 --> 58:18.080]  with the enterprise, the Iran Contra affair,
[58:18.080 --> 58:20.920]  that was, drugs were all over that thing
[58:20.920 --> 58:23.880]  in Central America, the so-called Contras.
[58:23.880 --> 58:24.920]  And the DCI...
[58:24.920 --> 58:27.640]  And then the general public will accept a police state
[58:27.640 --> 58:31.560]  in the name of fighting the drugs that energize the gangs
[58:31.560 --> 58:33.560]  and cause a breakdown of society now being seen
[58:33.560 --> 58:35.400]  in the United States and Mexico
[58:35.400 --> 58:38.080]  as they carry out the same operation here.
[58:38.080 --> 58:40.600]  William F. Engdahl, back in 70 seconds.
[58:42.520 --> 58:44.360]  You are listening to GCN.
[58:46.040 --> 58:48.400]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:51.160 --> 58:53.280]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[58:53.280 --> 58:56.080]  I've come with a message of information.
[58:56.080 --> 58:58.480]  9-Eleven was an inside job.
[58:58.480 --> 58:59.600]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[58:59.600 --> 59:01.240]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[59:01.240 --> 59:02.680]  I'll do the American people know
[59:02.680 --> 59:05.560]  that 9-Eleven was a stage, was engineered by you,
[59:05.560 --> 59:07.560]  David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission,
[59:07.560 --> 59:10.520]  the CIFAR, and then we sit down and shout out.
[59:10.520 --> 59:12.800]  The day that we stop asking questions
[59:12.800 --> 59:14.840]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds
[59:14.840 --> 59:17.400]  of justice to grow at our own door.
[59:17.400 --> 59:20.520]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[59:20.520 --> 59:22.560]  a global awakening has taken place.
[59:22.560 --> 59:27.200]  An inside job? How dare you?
[59:27.200 --> 59:31.800]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[59:31.800 --> 59:33.680]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[59:33.680 --> 59:36.480]  Well, Helen is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[59:36.480 --> 59:39.400]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years,
[59:39.400 --> 59:42.040]  we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-Eleven.
[59:42.040 --> 59:42.960]  Please rise.

[59:48.000 --> 59:53.000]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[59:53.560 --> 59:55.920]  Waging war on corruption,
[59:55.920 --> 59:58.920]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:05.320 --> 1:00:10.160]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:00:10.160 --> 1:00:13.280]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[1:00:13.280 --> 1:00:17.440]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:17.440 --> 1:00:21.880]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:23.600 --> 1:00:27.040]  How do you sell the public on accepting spies
[1:00:27.040 --> 1:00:27.960]  in every community?
[1:00:29.160 --> 1:00:31.400]  How do you get the public to somewhat accept
[1:00:31.400 --> 1:00:33.800]  or at least believe there's an excuse
[1:00:33.800 --> 1:00:35.160]  for training the children in the public
[1:00:35.160 --> 1:00:37.360]  and private schools to spy on their parents?
[1:00:38.840 --> 1:00:41.440]  Drugs, you ship in heroin and cocaine.
[1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:43.120]  You gain control of the police departments.
[1:00:43.120 --> 1:00:45.040]  You gain control of the major drug cartels.
[1:00:45.040 --> 1:00:46.120]  You launder the money.
[1:00:46.120 --> 1:00:48.840]  It gives you an ace in the hole,
[1:00:48.840 --> 1:00:50.440]  not just through your fractional reserve banking,
[1:00:50.440 --> 1:00:52.520]  but through the black market money.
[1:00:52.520 --> 1:00:54.600]  Then you stage terror attacks as a pretext
[1:00:54.600 --> 1:00:57.360]  to openly set up a military dictatorship.
[1:00:57.360 --> 1:01:00.120]  Then you engineer an economic collapse
[1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:02.720]  so you can then bring the nation to its knees
[1:01:02.720 --> 1:01:04.720]  and fully consolidate.
[1:01:04.720 --> 1:01:06.760]  Economic historian William F. Engdahl
[1:01:06.760 --> 1:01:08.880]  is our guest for another 30 minutes.
[1:01:08.880 --> 1:01:11.360]  And we've been getting into the British East India Company.
[1:01:11.360 --> 1:01:12.320]  What happened in India?
[1:01:12.320 --> 1:01:14.040]  What happened in China?
[1:01:14.040 --> 1:01:15.480]  How they brought those countries down?
[1:01:15.480 --> 1:01:17.840]  How they subdivided it into different sectors?
[1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:19.480]  This is globalism.
[1:01:19.480 --> 1:01:22.240]  International crime syndicate operating internationally,
[1:01:22.240 --> 1:01:24.360]  destroying all sovereign nations
[1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:25.840]  and hurting the people in the process.
[1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:26.840]  Sir, continue.
[1:01:26.840 --> 1:01:27.960]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:01:27.960 --> 1:01:32.840]  If we look to one of the main ostensible targets
[1:01:32.840 --> 1:01:37.720]  in the war on terror that was declared public enemy
[1:01:37.720 --> 1:01:42.440]  shortly after September 2001, that's Afghanistan.
[1:01:42.440 --> 1:01:46.720]  And the man who was brought in, hand-picked a CIA asset
[1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:50.800]  for at least the last 25 years,
[1:01:50.800 --> 1:01:56.600]  Hamad Karzai, as president of Afghanistan.
[1:01:56.600 --> 1:01:59.040]  He was brought in by a former member
[1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:05.240]  of the National Security Council under Bush Cheney Khaledzad.
[1:02:05.240 --> 1:02:10.040]  And this is an Afghan-American who is probably
[1:02:10.040 --> 1:02:14.400]  one of the least known and most dangerous people
[1:02:14.400 --> 1:02:19.440]  in the entire Bush Cheney arena.
[1:02:19.440 --> 1:02:22.680]  But he is the case officer for Iraq.
[1:02:22.680 --> 1:02:25.280]  He was special envoy of the president to Iraq.
[1:02:25.280 --> 1:02:31.480]  And he's the case officer for Afghanistan.
[1:02:31.480 --> 1:02:35.200]  Well, Karzai, it just came out in documents
[1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:36.640]  that were revealed by the New York Times.
[1:02:36.640 --> 1:02:38.520]  This isn't some conspiracy theory.
[1:02:38.520 --> 1:02:40.960]  This is official documents.
[1:02:40.960 --> 1:02:42.920]  His family's running the opium.
[1:02:42.920 --> 1:02:46.160]  And opium production's up 800%.
[1:02:46.160 --> 1:02:48.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:52.400]  And the Karzai family, this is known as Afghani exiles,
[1:02:52.400 --> 1:02:56.680]  whom I asked three and a half, four years ago in Europe.
[1:02:56.680 --> 1:03:00.600]  I said, what's your estimation of this fellow Karzai?
[1:03:00.600 --> 1:03:03.120]  He said, well, he's the opium boss of Afghanistan.
[1:03:03.120 --> 1:03:04.160]  This is well known.
[1:03:04.160 --> 1:03:06.360]  Not only the unicol executive.
[1:03:06.360 --> 1:03:08.080]  So this is just out in the open.
[1:03:08.080 --> 1:03:11.160]  And when you hear about our troops rating opium fields,
[1:03:11.160 --> 1:03:14.080]  that's the few pockets that aren't controlled by Karzai.
[1:03:14.080 --> 1:03:16.720]  So the only war over there is a war over opium,
[1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:19.760]  just like what we have a war over cocaine in Colombia right
[1:03:19.760 --> 1:03:20.400]  now.
[1:03:20.400 --> 1:03:23.960]  Yeah, and how many billions of dollars
[1:03:23.960 --> 1:03:30.360]  does the US taxpayer pay for this mess in Colombia?
[1:03:30.360 --> 1:03:34.520]  Uribe is essentially a puppet of the Washington
[1:03:34.520 --> 1:03:37.320]  administration, dependent on it for billions of dollars
[1:03:37.320 --> 1:03:39.560]  of military aid and so forth.
[1:03:39.560 --> 1:03:42.320]  So we've militarized a narco democracy, in effect,
[1:03:42.320 --> 1:03:43.480]  in Colombia.
[1:03:43.480 --> 1:03:46.600]  And to make sure that the supply lines, in effect,
[1:03:46.600 --> 1:03:50.920]  are protected to feed that poison into Mexico
[1:03:50.920 --> 1:03:54.280]  and from Mexico into the United States
[1:03:54.280 --> 1:03:57.360]  and destroy a whole generation.
[1:03:57.360 --> 1:04:00.640]  And Mexico's having 50 drug-related murders a day.
[1:04:00.640 --> 1:04:02.720]  It's spelling into the United States.
[1:04:02.720 --> 1:04:05.560]  And the public's calling for a police state to save us.
[1:04:05.560 --> 1:04:09.280]  Now, well, that's the predictable response.
[1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:11.600]  And that plays beautifully, I think,
[1:04:11.600 --> 1:04:17.080]  into the hands of where the power elites want this thing to go.
[1:04:17.080 --> 1:04:22.160]  The signs of a police state locked down in the United States
[1:04:22.160 --> 1:04:28.120]  at the slightest provocation are getting so stark
[1:04:28.120 --> 1:04:30.600]  that it makes your hair stand on end
[1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:33.240]  if you have any hair left at all after some of the things
[1:04:33.240 --> 1:04:34.480]  that have been going on.
[1:04:34.480 --> 1:04:41.080]  The reports of over 800 former military bases
[1:04:41.080 --> 1:04:42.600]  across the United States, you know,
[1:04:42.600 --> 1:04:45.760]  Rumsfeld was very good about budget consciousness
[1:04:45.760 --> 1:04:47.800]  and closed-out, all sorts of military bases,
[1:04:47.800 --> 1:04:50.400]  including Fort Dix in New Jersey.
[1:04:50.400 --> 1:04:53.920]  Those are really clandestine martial law takeover command
[1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:54.240]  centers.
[1:04:54.240 --> 1:04:54.640]  Stay there.
[1:04:54.640 --> 1:04:56.680]  Let's talk about that when we get back.
[1:04:56.680 --> 1:04:57.400]  Stay with us.
[1:04:57.400 --> 1:05:04.960]  HempUSA.org is now offering free shipping worldwide

[1:05:35.960 --> 1:05:38.920]  and brings funguses, viruses, and bacterial levels down

[1:05:47.560 --> 1:05:48.760]  it will heal itself.
[1:05:48.760 --> 1:05:51.560]  Ask yourself, why does our government not allow this crop
[1:05:51.560 --> 1:05:52.880]  to grow in the US?
[1:05:52.880 --> 1:05:55.400]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[1:05:55.400 --> 1:06:01.160]  Call 908-6912608 or go to hempUSA.org today.
[1:06:01.160 --> 1:06:04.360]  Today, unlike any other, in the long course of American history,
[1:06:04.360 --> 1:06:07.880]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:06:07.880 --> 1:06:10.520]  The enemies struck America on September 11.
[1:06:10.520 --> 1:06:12.040]  But who is the enemy?
[1:06:12.040 --> 1:06:12.880]  Bin Laden.
[1:06:12.880 --> 1:06:13.880]  This is his MO.
[1:06:13.880 --> 1:06:15.200]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[1:06:15.200 --> 1:06:17.240]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:06:17.240 --> 1:06:19.280]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film
[1:06:19.280 --> 1:06:21.280]  to take a close look at the terrorist ties
[1:06:21.280 --> 1:06:24.320]  to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:06:24.320 --> 1:06:27.160]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis, again,
[1:06:27.160 --> 1:06:31.160]  very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[1:06:31.160 --> 1:06:34.960]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:06:34.960 --> 1:06:36.800]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA,
[1:06:36.800 --> 1:06:40.240]  the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:06:40.240 --> 1:06:43.000]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games,
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:45.120]  the shadow government, and much, much more.
[1:06:45.120 --> 1:06:46.360]  Fabled Enemies.

[1:06:51.360 --> 1:06:54.040]  of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.

[1:06:57.440 --> 1:07:00.920]  Red, white, and white.
[1:07:00.920 --> 1:07:03.320]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[1:07:03.320 --> 1:07:05.240]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure,
[1:07:05.240 --> 1:07:07.040]  and high cholesterol levels may not
[1:07:07.040 --> 1:07:08.720]  be fully detected by you.
[1:07:08.720 --> 1:07:10.240]  But the symptoms are there.
[1:07:10.240 --> 1:07:12.280]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes,
[1:07:12.280 --> 1:07:15.280]  and drops, or circulation and irregular heartbeat
[1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:17.280]  are just a few of these that can alert you
[1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:18.680]  that something is wrong.
[1:07:18.680 --> 1:07:20.760]  Hear how heart and body extract is

[1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:27.840]  Government in charge even up production. It is mainstream news that it is legal for international
[1:08:27.840 --> 1:08:31.920]  bodies and governments to invest heroin and cocaine money in the New York Stock Exchange.
[1:08:33.440 --> 1:08:39.280]  Money laundering, all of it is completely legal for the elites. But if they catch your teenage son
[1:08:39.280 --> 1:08:45.200]  with marijuana, they're going to prison. That's why they wage war. 87% of drug users, illegal drug
[1:08:45.200 --> 1:08:52.080]  users, only use marijuana. They need to keep that phony war going as a pretext. You've only got about
[1:08:52.080 --> 1:08:58.400]  13% of drug users that use the heroin and cocaine and other things. One of the only
[1:08:58.400 --> 1:09:03.040]  scourges that isn't government-controlled is methamphetamine. Then because the government
[1:09:03.040 --> 1:09:09.600]  controls the ingredients to that, the makers of it have to mix scores of chemicals. That's what
[1:09:09.600 --> 1:09:15.120]  makes it so much more toxic and is killing so many people. Be bad enough to have pure methamphetamine
[1:09:15.120 --> 1:09:19.840]  on the streets. Of course, the government makes that to where it's made with toxic waste and so
[1:09:19.840 --> 1:09:25.200]  it kills people. Whatever they touch is pure death. They know what they're doing. They're
[1:09:25.200 --> 1:09:30.080]  completely and totally ruthless. William F. Hingdahl, they're taking over the food systems,
[1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:35.040]  the GMO, the stomach and intestine cancers are off the charts. Everything by design
[1:09:35.040 --> 1:09:40.720]  and they're only intensifying it. Where do you see this going? I mean, they've shown they're
[1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:45.360]  hubris. There's no level they're going to stop at. They're funding the social services to grab
[1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:49.680]  over a million children a year. They're only building more prisons. They're converting
[1:09:49.680 --> 1:09:55.040]  much of the economy over into a militarized police state. Domestically, the defense contractor
[1:09:55.040 --> 1:09:59.840]  companies are running the face scanning and license plate running systems. The threat fusion
[1:09:59.840 --> 1:10:05.360]  centers on a county by county basis are being federalized. The left thinks that Marshall
[1:10:05.360 --> 1:10:08.960]  Law is going to be declared this week by George Bush. Marshall Law, as you said, is already here
[1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:14.400]  economically. It's an incremental militarization with the brigades activating with the announcements
[1:10:14.400 --> 1:10:19.760]  of microwave guns to be used against the American people. Where do you see all this going?
[1:10:20.320 --> 1:10:26.960]  Well, there are any number of scenarios, but as you point out, all the executive orders have
[1:10:26.960 --> 1:10:33.440]  already been signed and put in place to mobilize people into forced work camps like the Nazis did
[1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:44.640]  in Germany to seize properties, seize housings, relocate communities, and take federal control
[1:10:44.640 --> 1:10:52.000]  of all of the functions of the economy if the president signs in order to declare a national
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:57.440]  emergency. And that could be almost anything. One scenario I've heard, and I just throw this out,
[1:10:57.440 --> 1:11:02.800]  that people keep this in mind. God forbid that it happens, but it has happened to other American
[1:11:02.800 --> 1:11:10.960]  presidents. Let's imagine a scenario if a certain Democratic candidate is elected and
[1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:17.840]  takes the oath of office next January. There was a whole series in the New York Times over the weekend
[1:11:18.480 --> 1:11:28.080]  about the fact that Sarah Palin, this fanatical member of Joel's army, this fanatical Christian
[1:11:28.080 --> 1:11:33.200]  sect that has nothing to do with the traditional Christianity, but is very powerful in certain
[1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:39.680]  military circles and certain intelligence circles in the US. In her campaign rally, she's fanning
[1:11:39.680 --> 1:11:45.280]  hate where people shout and they get so whipped up with frenzy, they shout out, kill Obama, kill
[1:11:45.280 --> 1:11:52.240]  Obama, let's kill the bastard. And as the New York Times points out, that's a fairly unhealthy
[1:11:52.240 --> 1:11:58.880]  climate to create his background noise. But that could be a cover for another CIA assassination
[1:11:58.880 --> 1:12:03.680]  of something if the elites decided they wanted to take out the president and declare a state of
[1:12:03.680 --> 1:12:09.440]  emergency. Any number of things are possible. It's gone so far down the line when the Congress
[1:12:09.440 --> 1:12:17.680]  buckled under with this fake protest organized by McCain. After this little antique, they buckled
[1:12:17.680 --> 1:12:23.120]  under and gave exactly what Paulson wanted in the first place, Paulson, and his sidekick, as you
[1:12:23.120 --> 1:12:37.200]  point out, Cash Kerry, the Patriot Act in the financial realm, that there is no institutional
[1:12:37.200 --> 1:12:46.000]  opposition that's visible on the horizon at this point. It's a slow-motion coup d'état or police
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:51.200]  state takeover by these elites. They're getting, I think, they're desperate. I think, frankly,
[1:12:53.280 --> 1:13:02.320]  this is in all aspects, this is an empire in terminal decline, like the Roman Empire in the
[1:13:02.320 --> 1:13:11.680]  4th century AD. But it's such a vicious, wicked empire. Empires have always been based on slavery
[1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:16.320]  as one of the main pillars that support it. And so how do we have slavery today? Well,
[1:13:16.320 --> 1:13:22.400]  they introduce addictive compounds, drugs, into the society. They use that to corrupt the police
[1:13:22.400 --> 1:13:28.080]  and military and the constabulary. Then that increases crime because the drugs are very expensive,
[1:13:28.080 --> 1:13:32.320]  and so the drug addicts go out and rob and steal to get it. Then that uses a pretext to
[1:13:32.320 --> 1:13:36.880]  expand the police force. Then the police force has moved into mainly policing and running
[1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:44.560]  intelligence operations and spying on the citizenry. That is so cold-blooded to ship the drugs in
[1:13:44.560 --> 1:13:48.400]  and then have cops being killed, citizens being killed, the drive-by shootings,
[1:13:48.400 --> 1:13:54.160]  everything that's associated with black market wars. That's only one facet to what these people
[1:13:54.160 --> 1:14:00.640]  do. They are truly wicked. They are truly cold-blooded, and they want a global depression. They want
[1:14:00.640 --> 1:14:06.240]  a global collapse so that they can reorganize things and pose as saviors throughout the process.
[1:14:06.240 --> 1:14:11.200]  The big question is, Ron Paul and others have said, can we expose that it's them orchestrating this
[1:14:11.200 --> 1:14:16.800]  or and then use the calamities they've created as a pretext to wake the people up against them,
[1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:20.240]  or will they be able to use it as a pretext to sew up total control?
[1:14:20.800 --> 1:14:27.360]  Yeah, I think it's a toss-up right now. I think if people, one thing that the American people
[1:14:27.360 --> 1:14:33.040]  have historically is an incredible capacity to get angry when they really finally get the picture.
[1:14:33.040 --> 1:14:40.160]  Now, you can look back historically, Alex, in the post-war period at the tens and hundreds of
[1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:46.400]  billions of dollars, probably into the trillions of dollars spent by the elite to create an information
[1:14:46.400 --> 1:14:53.280]  cocoon around the reality that people live in the United States so that the average American has
[1:14:53.280 --> 1:14:58.800]  not a clue of what's really going on in the world. The GIs come back from Iraq, come into a barn,
[1:14:58.800 --> 1:15:03.760]  sit down, have a beer and say, why do Europeans hate Americans so much? We're trying to help them,
[1:15:03.760 --> 1:15:09.120]  we're trying to save them, we're trying to defeat terrorism in Iraq, and they don't have a clue
[1:15:09.120 --> 1:15:14.480]  how they're being used. So although some of them do, there's through the internet and so forth,
[1:15:14.480 --> 1:15:18.720]  there's a huge... Well, that's what's so sad though. There's so many good people in government who
[1:15:18.720 --> 1:15:23.760]  don't even have part of the picture, much less the big picture, and they get shot, they get maimed,
[1:15:23.760 --> 1:15:28.240]  they get killed, they get their health care cut. I mean, police that are enforcing this corrupt system,
[1:15:28.240 --> 1:15:33.520]  their whole future is being destroyed, their pension funds are being sucked up in the derivative's
[1:15:33.520 --> 1:15:40.400]  black hole. And so, I mean, that is the big question is, will they wake up? And the people
[1:15:40.400 --> 1:15:44.720]  are waking up to some degree, but it takes a lot of courage to admit just how bad things are.
[1:15:47.120 --> 1:15:51.200]  And does indeed. And a lot of people are scared for their pension, they're scared for the...
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:56.960]  You know, we're all mortal, everybody listening to your program is at one point
[1:15:56.960 --> 1:16:02.560]  another in his life going to cash in. So, you know, what are we going to do with that time?
[1:16:03.280 --> 1:16:09.840]  And there's a lot of examples of people in places like Germany in the 1930s who said,
[1:16:09.840 --> 1:16:14.880]  well, if I'm just brave and keep my head low, it'll blow over and maybe I'll survive.
[1:16:15.600 --> 1:16:19.600]  And that was a pretty bad experience for a lot of people.
[1:16:19.600 --> 1:16:26.800]  That's right. In fact, every avenue I look now, historically, and integrating my own analysis
[1:16:26.800 --> 1:16:31.840]  with all the other great experts like yourself we have on, the most dangerous course is going
[1:16:31.840 --> 1:16:36.960]  along with this and submitting to them because they see that as a green light to just run wild
[1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:43.680]  in their hyper dominance and control and corruption. And the safest course is aggressively standing up,
[1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:49.440]  speaking out, saying no to them. And just as 9-11 was an inside job and we had to start a movement
[1:16:50.240 --> 1:16:55.360]  and to expose false flag terror that's been very successful in neutralizing the enemies,
[1:16:55.360 --> 1:17:01.520]  the social engineers use of that. We have to start a movement now to expose this financial
[1:17:01.520 --> 1:17:07.680]  implosion is a controlled military executed operation and that if they are successful,
[1:17:07.680 --> 1:17:11.440]  we will go into the new 21st century dehumanization control grid.
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:17.360]  Yeah. Yeah. And I think it's, as I say again, I think it's up for grabs right now. They're
[1:17:18.240 --> 1:17:23.840]  in a high stakes gamble, very the highest stakes imaginable, the future, their power and
[1:17:23.840 --> 1:17:27.840]  the... Yeah, let's talk about that. What will happen if they don't win? Because you're talking
[1:17:27.840 --> 1:17:31.760]  about this confluence, you know, that some of the elements aren't going along with this, but they
[1:17:31.760 --> 1:17:36.960]  may be whipped into going along. I mean, what do you see happening or on the good side and the bad
[1:17:36.960 --> 1:17:43.440]  side? Where do you see this going? I see what's emerging is from China. I see various Asian
[1:17:43.440 --> 1:17:52.480]  countries lining up distinctly outside the dollar domination that they've had for the last 30,
[1:17:52.480 --> 1:17:58.960]  40 years and beginning to look to regional solutions. I see Russia and China moving closer
[1:17:58.960 --> 1:18:06.480]  together. Now, that may sound heretical inside the United States, but keep in mind that the U.S.
[1:18:06.480 --> 1:18:13.200]  through NATO has rammed the American and NATO missiles right up the nose of Moscow in the last
[1:18:13.200 --> 1:18:20.960]  16 to 18 years at a time when the Soviet Union dissolved and they abandoned the Warsaw Pact.
[1:18:20.960 --> 1:18:25.280]  They started taking down their military and then all of a sudden they look around and what's
[1:18:25.280 --> 1:18:31.920]  Washington doing? All these countries are being recruited into NATO and that's a life and death
[1:18:31.920 --> 1:18:37.440]  threat to Russian security. So that's in effect pushing the Russians and the Chinese closer together
[1:18:37.440 --> 1:18:43.440]  to Chinese are being hit by U.S. destabilizations in Tibet, U.S. destabilizations run by the
[1:18:43.440 --> 1:18:50.880]  State Department in Burma, Myanmar, which is a strategic neighbor of China, both for energy and
[1:18:50.880 --> 1:18:59.120]  for naval docking rights to protect their oil lanes from the Persian Gulf. So what's happening is
[1:18:59.120 --> 1:19:06.640]  these countries say, look, this new world order of the Bush clan spells disaster for us. We better
[1:19:06.640 --> 1:19:11.680]  figure out a new combination. And I think this is exactly what the U.S. elites, the big new
[1:19:11.680 --> 1:19:17.600]  Brzezinski, Barack Obama's foreign policy advisor, warned against. He said American
[1:19:18.480 --> 1:19:25.840]  primacy, supremacy as the sole superpower depends on our preventing the nations of Eurasia from
[1:19:25.840 --> 1:19:30.880]  coming together because they have everything they need to be independent of us. But necessity
[1:19:30.880 --> 1:19:35.440]  is the mother of invention, so they're being forced into the coalition. Exactly,
[1:19:35.440 --> 1:19:42.320]  exactly, a coalition of the unwilling. And, you know, reality can change a lot of things. So
[1:19:43.520 --> 1:19:48.560]  I think it's one of the most extraordinary periods because you have
[1:19:50.160 --> 1:19:53.920]  Hold on, really nothing at all. Final segment, I'm going to hear from you how you think this is
[1:19:53.920 --> 1:19:58.160]  going to quiet and unfold. Maybe twist his arm for 10 more minutes to 40 afters. You can talk
[1:19:58.160 --> 1:20:04.320]  some about the eugenics agenda. Gold, it's like nothing else on earth from the Romans through
[1:20:04.320 --> 1:20:09.680]  the Renaissance, from the industrial age to the space age. Gold has weathered the test of time.

[1:20:20.400 --> 1:20:26.320]  of gold as the common sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[1:24:13.760 --> 1:24:21.440]  Okay, William F. Dingdahl running back on a few weeks to get into the larger eugenics
[1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:25.920]  operation, which is stated. I mean, it's hard to believe this stuff but it's on record. It's
[1:24:27.200 --> 1:24:33.040]  bad news. William, finishing up, what do you expect them to do in the short term economically trying
[1:24:33.040 --> 1:24:37.120]  to set up this new international banking system that's really already there but that is making
[1:24:37.120 --> 1:24:45.200]  you go public versus what you think they'll actually get? What I think is emerging is going
[1:24:45.200 --> 1:24:52.400]  to be a frail compromise from the original agenda that Paulson Bernanke and Greenspan and Company
[1:24:52.400 --> 1:25:04.080]  in the New York JV Morgan Chase City Group wanted. Their plan was mooted last week by France and by
[1:25:04.080 --> 1:25:09.680]  Italy to governments very close to the Bush administration in Europe and it was shot down
[1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:22.160]  very, very strongly by the Germans and several other countries. I think what's going to emerge
[1:25:22.160 --> 1:25:28.320]  in the next months is going to be a very, very difficult period from the standpoint of Paulson's
[1:25:28.320 --> 1:25:34.400]  agenda, the New World Order agenda and it's this battle between the national solution which the
[1:25:34.400 --> 1:25:39.680]  Germans are opting for and this global solution which is kind of this global control, the money
[1:25:39.680 --> 1:25:45.680]  you control the world scheme that Paulson and friends have created this securitization to try
[1:25:45.680 --> 1:25:52.160]  to bring a giant step further and it's going to be up for grabs. It's going to be extremely
[1:25:52.160 --> 1:25:59.760]  dangerous how it's going to unravel into the new year. The other thing is that makes this thing so
[1:26:01.280 --> 1:26:09.840]  hairy for Paulson and Co is the fact that the resets on the subprime have peaked and are starting
[1:26:09.840 --> 1:26:15.280]  to ebb but now we have a whole new wave of resets that kick in this month, October 2008
[1:26:15.280 --> 1:26:24.000]  and peak in October 2009 for so-called Alt A, the next tranche of mortgages of toxic waste.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:30.480]  And then not just mortgages, credit cards, home improvement loans, car loans, it is all
[1:26:30.480 --> 1:26:37.440]  coming due as the real economy implodes overlaying that with at least 20% inflation already 15 but
[1:26:37.440 --> 1:26:43.600]  20% compounded by next year. This is going to be hellish. Yeah and these resets, I mean this
[1:26:43.600 --> 1:26:50.240]  pre-programs, it's like the tsunami just wave after wave after wave, it's going to be a devastating
[1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:56.400]  thing and that's why Paulson wanted to militarize the financial system under his command or under
[1:26:56.400 --> 1:27:05.040]  the command of cash and carry, I guess we can call him, but directly in the hands of the elite.
[1:27:05.040 --> 1:27:13.600]  And if that doesn't become an election issue in this campaign and they get taken on directly then
[1:27:13.600 --> 1:27:17.840]  there's something seriously wrong. For those that don't know what a derivatives reset is
[1:27:17.840 --> 1:27:23.520]  and these credit default swaps and all these securitized debt, explain what them coming due
[1:27:23.520 --> 1:27:28.960]  means. Well this isn't a derivative reset, it's a home mortgage reset on the interest rate.
[1:27:28.960 --> 1:27:37.200]  Now I know but those have them been sold as securities so that causes that blow up.
[1:27:37.200 --> 1:27:43.680]  Yeah they were bundled into giant securities of a billion dollars worth or 500 million dollars
[1:27:43.680 --> 1:27:48.480]  worth and sold to pension funds because Moody's and company gave them a AAA rating, got a little
[1:27:48.480 --> 1:27:55.840]  bit of insurance on the edge and packaged them as good as gold, good as US Treasury bonds AAA
[1:27:55.840 --> 1:28:02.560]  and paying a much higher yield. Well the underlines are these mortgages and the mortgages for the
[1:28:03.200 --> 1:28:10.720]  least credit worthy segment of the population or a whole chunk of it, maybe the 40% on the bottom
[1:28:10.720 --> 1:28:17.280]  in terms of income, those go into reset so the defaults walking away from homes and a lot of
[1:28:17.280 --> 1:28:22.320]  them were speculative. Now people buying a home as a spec home and flipping them and three to five
[1:28:22.320 --> 1:28:26.720]  or six months or three years before the reset takes place, they're just going to walk away from
[1:28:26.720 --> 1:28:32.320]  those homes and the banking system is going to be choking in empty homes. The ghetto gangs are
[1:28:32.320 --> 1:28:36.960]  already moving into neighborhoods in Ohio, California and elsewhere. Are you kidding? They
[1:28:36.960 --> 1:28:43.680]  got mountain lions moving into California into major neighborhoods and Bobcats. William and
[1:28:43.680 --> 1:28:50.080]  Engdahl has been an amazing interview and bottom line, the establishment is massing all the money
[1:28:50.080 --> 1:28:53.920]  and power to themselves at the expense of the dollar down the road. What are they going to
[1:28:53.920 --> 1:28:58.080]  do in the last minute we've got when everybody finds out the dollar has been turned into toilet
[1:28:58.080 --> 1:29:02.880]  paper? Well the dollar has been strong primarily because the hedge funds and others have to
[1:29:03.600 --> 1:29:08.480]  come up with dollar assets to shore up their positions so they're getting out of Japanese
[1:29:08.480 --> 1:29:14.080]  yen, Euro positions and so forth. That's going to play out fairly soon I think within the next
[1:29:14.080 --> 1:29:21.360]  weeks and once that's over the reality of the disaster that is US economy going into an economic
[1:29:21.360 --> 1:29:28.720]  depression like in the 30s, that's going to hit and there's going to be very little inclination
[1:29:28.720 --> 1:29:35.200]  by the part of foreign investors. Are you saying guaranteed depression? I don't see anything that
[1:29:35.200 --> 1:29:39.200]  gives an indication it's not going to be a great depression probably worse than the 1930s but the
[1:29:39.200 --> 1:29:44.400]  elites in the 30s had no problem with putting the population through depression. William and Engdahl
[1:29:44.400 --> 1:29:50.160]  when do you see the depression happening? It's on it's on just expanding out from now thank you.

[1:31:07.120 --> 1:31:13.040]  this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th but who is the enemy? Ben Laden.
[1:31:13.040 --> 1:31:17.440]  This is his ammo. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Ben Laden.

[1:33:01.600 --> 1:33:07.200]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:33:07.200 --> 1:33:22.640]  All right. Here's CNBC today with a big market analyst talking about how everything's been
[1:33:22.640 --> 1:33:30.160]  going liquid the last two weeks as people try to secure their position as they jump in different
[1:33:30.160 --> 1:33:36.400]  securities, different commodities, different things they own to try to make up losses they've
[1:33:36.400 --> 1:33:45.600]  had in the market, people who've been shorting things. There's many different economic devices
[1:33:45.600 --> 1:33:52.320]  that they've been having to liquefy their assets for. But they're just finally mainstream
[1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:59.600]  experts everywhere talking about the fact that the demand for gold is so high that mints all
[1:33:59.600 --> 1:34:03.760]  of the world from Germany to the United States have run out of gold and can't see when they're
[1:34:03.760 --> 1:34:08.400]  going to have coins. The South African big government meant to put out Krugerans is out.
[1:34:09.200 --> 1:34:12.960]  They can't sell anymore. Everything they're mining is just going to previous orders.
[1:34:13.600 --> 1:34:17.440]  I wanted to play a little bit of this then get into martial law. Here we go.
[1:34:18.080 --> 1:34:22.640]  So how does your portfolio look then? I mean just taking into consideration what Steve says
[1:34:22.640 --> 1:34:26.240]  at the moment where we're trading right now. How should one's portfolio look heading into this
[1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:30.480]  week coming off the back of last week where so much was lost? Do you put more into gold?
[1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:34.000]  One viewer is asking about your outlook for gold over the next six to 12 months. Are you
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:38.480]  shoring more towards some of the currency trades instead of equities?
[1:34:38.480 --> 1:34:41.440]  Well, I am coming into this weekend. There's no question what the portfolio should have been
[1:34:41.440 --> 1:34:47.520]  flat. But coming out of it, I think you've got to start picking out where exactly the consequences
[1:34:47.520 --> 1:34:53.280]  are going to fall. For example, take gold. I remain very bullish of gold over the medium term.
[1:34:53.280 --> 1:34:57.360]  However, in the very near term, I think that there's a risk for further liquidation to occur.
[1:34:57.360 --> 1:35:02.240]  There's further deflationary forces occurring, not least of which is because, as we pointed out,
[1:35:02.240 --> 1:35:08.320]  there's going to be a significant pull on resource from government issuance. So gold could easily
[1:35:08.320 --> 1:35:13.680]  play into the 650 to 850 place over the course of the next three to six months. Buying zone.
[1:35:13.680 --> 1:35:18.880]  Gold will be through 2000 sometime in the next 18 months. We are going to have the most almighty
[1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:23.280]  inflationary ramifications for what's going on because I'll bet you that the central banks
[1:35:23.280 --> 1:35:26.640]  don't pull back this liquidity in anything like the amount of time that they should.
[1:35:26.640 --> 1:35:30.400]  So why haven't we seen more buying in gold over the past two weeks alone?
[1:35:30.400 --> 1:35:33.840]  I think that's a question some people have asked. I think Friday was very indicative,
[1:35:33.840 --> 1:35:39.600]  Louisa. Everything got sold. Gold sold off about $70 from its highs. Everything that
[1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:43.760]  anyone could sell to raise cash to pay off whatever they needed to pay off. Gold was
[1:35:43.760 --> 1:35:48.080]  one of the things that got hit. Oil has been hit in the same light as well. Both, of course,
[1:35:48.080 --> 1:35:52.560]  are reflecting, additionally, the lack of speculative element. Both are reflecting
[1:35:52.560 --> 1:35:56.800]  economic conditions going forward and the inflationary forces around us. That will
[1:35:56.800 --> 1:36:00.480]  change, but that moment isn't upon us. Let me jump in and ask a similar question.
[1:36:01.040 --> 1:36:06.400]  So what's happening is, and I agree with that, I don't think gold's going to go below 750.
[1:36:07.280 --> 1:36:12.000]  In fact, it may not even do that. Probably won't. But the point is that's because you have
[1:36:13.280 --> 1:36:18.480]  massive depression in the real world economy, not just in the United States of Europe.
[1:36:18.480 --> 1:36:24.080]  Massive contraction. That's why oil is plunging. There's no money to go in and speculate it up.
[1:36:24.080 --> 1:36:28.000]  And it doesn't matter if the dollars devalued because we go into the winter season
[1:36:28.640 --> 1:36:32.080]  when there's a lot less driving. It's always the summer season when we see oil spike.
[1:36:33.040 --> 1:36:37.120]  You are seeing the fact that millions and millions of barrels a day less are being
[1:36:37.120 --> 1:36:41.360]  used in the US, millions a day less in England, millions a day less in Europe.
[1:36:42.320 --> 1:36:47.120]  And so because there has been such a massive drop in the on people using it because the
[1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:51.360]  economy is contracting and less things are being delivered to stores and less 18 wheelers are
[1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:59.120]  driving down the highways, you're going to probably continue to see oil drop down to maybe even $60
[1:36:59.120 --> 1:37:05.360]  a barrel. But then as the inflation sets in, the hyperinflation, it won't matter if the economy
[1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:11.280]  has been depressed because you're going to see oil race back up to highs, perhaps even by next
[1:37:11.280 --> 1:37:18.480]  summer of above what we saw last summer. Okay, so right now everything's being cashed in. The
[1:37:18.480 --> 1:37:24.480]  economy is grinding to a halt. It is stopping for all intents and purposes. The factory lines
[1:37:24.480 --> 1:37:28.240]  are shutting down. All of this is going on. By the way, Ford and General Motors knew this. That's
[1:37:28.240 --> 1:37:32.560]  why they're moving to China, moving to Mexico, moving out of the United States, shutting down
[1:37:33.360 --> 1:37:39.440]  entire core areas of manufacturing. They're leaving and they're preparing to have a scale down smaller
[1:37:39.440 --> 1:37:44.320]  market in the future. That's why there's major talk of Chrysler and General Motors merging,
[1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:49.360]  because there just isn't room for that many major automakers at the scale we've been seeing
[1:37:50.080 --> 1:37:56.240]  with the fact that the economy is going into freefall. Now, all of this is being engineered.
[1:37:56.240 --> 1:38:01.280]  The global crime cartel, the global banking system, has to bring in world depression in
[1:38:01.280 --> 1:38:07.280]  the real economy so they're able to consolidate wealth. And then all the liquidity, the only
[1:38:07.280 --> 1:38:12.400]  real liquidity is being guaranteed by the central banks of the United States and Europe
[1:38:13.120 --> 1:38:20.560]  to be paid directly into select inside crews, a select good old boys network where they will
[1:38:20.560 --> 1:38:27.520]  be the only ones that have any real currency or liquidity to do things like takeovers,
[1:38:28.400 --> 1:38:35.520]  leveraged buyouts. You're going to see an expanded, let's slow down lately, an expanded
[1:38:35.520 --> 1:38:42.880]  second wave as the prices of companies plummet, as the prices of stocks plummet. You're going to see
[1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:51.440]  a massive consolidation by this inner group of financial robber barons. And I would just say
[1:38:51.440 --> 1:38:56.640]  that the next year and a half, you will see that really intensify. So right now, as bad as things
[1:38:56.640 --> 1:39:04.080]  are, this is only the edge, the leading edge of the black hole. As we get closer to the center
[1:39:04.080 --> 1:39:10.960]  of the black hole to the vortex, the economic forces are going to be conservatively hundreds
[1:39:10.960 --> 1:39:17.120]  of times compounded what we're currently seeing. You integrate that in with massive increase in crime,
[1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:25.760]  as even people that have not been criminal in the past start stealing to make ends meet.
[1:39:25.760 --> 1:39:29.360]  Not saying it's good, but that historically happens. It's just a fact. People who did
[1:39:29.360 --> 1:39:35.040]  have a criminal lifestyle decades ago, but a quote been reformed by getting better jobs,
[1:39:35.040 --> 1:39:41.760]  they are going to revert back into crime. Drug addicts are still going to want their drugs.
[1:39:41.760 --> 1:39:47.440]  And so you're going to see a massive increase as inflation goes up in the amount of stereos and
[1:39:47.440 --> 1:39:54.000]  computers and jewelry and cars that have to be stolen. There's going to be a lowering in the
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:58.880]  market, even though there's inflation in what people will pay for stolen goods, because there'll
[1:39:58.880 --> 1:40:04.720]  be a glut of items being sold in the open market. You already see RVs being sold all over the place
[1:40:04.720 --> 1:40:09.600]  in Austin, SUVs being sold all over the place just on the streets and people's yards. You're
[1:40:09.600 --> 1:40:15.040]  going to see a glut of items poured out as we go into depression in the real economy and there
[1:40:15.040 --> 1:40:23.600]  will be a giant glut or an oversupply of goods and services. With a real contracting money supply
[1:40:23.600 --> 1:40:30.720]  physically on top of a physically depressed economy with an overlay of hyperinflation,
[1:40:30.720 --> 1:40:36.400]  but only liquidity being given to the elite banks. You understand that means imploding
[1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:41.520]  the real economy, massively increasing crime, massively increasing unemployment,
[1:40:41.520 --> 1:40:48.720]  putting huge burdens on top of the government funds to pay out the unemployment and welfare,
[1:40:48.720 --> 1:40:59.520]  which will then accelerate the printing of dollars even more. When you couple a real economy
[1:40:59.520 --> 1:41:07.440]  depression with hyperinflation, you have hyperstag inflation. God help us. Never before seen,
[1:41:07.440 --> 1:41:12.720]  not even in the Weimar Republic, this is going to be unprecedented. Now, the Corbett report,
[1:41:12.720 --> 1:41:17.680]  not the Corbett report, the Corbett report is a great YouTube channel like NuffRespect
[1:41:17.680 --> 1:41:23.440]  or some of the other great ones that are out there, the Gatekeeper Invasion. Gatekeeper,
[1:41:23.440 --> 1:41:27.600]  I wish you wouldn't have left YouTube even though they suspended your account. We need you there.
[1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:32.480]  That's a bigger viral port for you to fight the Info War, but there are so many great YouTube
[1:41:32.480 --> 1:41:37.360]  channels that then virally go into all the other major video channels reaching millions every week.
[1:41:38.560 --> 1:41:42.080]  He has really been doing a great job putting some material together and I think in,
[1:41:42.080 --> 1:41:49.280]  well, how long is this clip, John? In this 10-minute clip, I think he boils it down nicely,
[1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:55.120]  then I'll come back and break down the latest developments out of the Boston Globe headline,
[1:41:55.120 --> 1:42:00.480]  postponing the election. Is it a joke or is it? It tongue-in-cheek but seriously looks at it,
[1:42:01.360 --> 1:42:05.840]  but it's more of a liberal panic that George Bush will declare martial law. That was certainly
[1:42:05.840 --> 1:42:09.840]  always a threat, but we're under physical martial law now. The type of hot martial law you're
[1:42:09.840 --> 1:42:14.560]  talking about isn't needed. That may come in the future with riots and the pretext they need to
[1:42:14.560 --> 1:42:19.920]  assault the public, but this will happen in slow motion. The media is going to come out and say,
[1:42:19.920 --> 1:42:24.640]  see the election happened, no problem. John McCain or Barack Obama, there wasn't any martial law.
[1:42:24.640 --> 1:42:28.800]  You guys are discredited. Meanwhile, as troops start fanning out on the streets of America,
[1:42:29.840 --> 1:42:35.920]  driving by, helping the police for fires, roadside accidents they're announcing in the Army Times,
[1:42:35.920 --> 1:42:39.840]  oh, they're going to have the jaws of life and help get people out of their cars. It'll all be
[1:42:39.840 --> 1:42:44.800]  PR. Why is the Army here? Oh, they're helping. So you have to have that PR face first,
[1:42:44.800 --> 1:42:49.040]  then the hot martial law comes later. Let's go ahead and start the report.
[1:42:49.040 --> 1:42:53.120]  During debates on the banker bailout bill on the floor of Congress last week,
[1:42:53.680 --> 1:42:57.040]  Congressman Brad Sherman made a startling revelation.
[1:42:58.880 --> 1:43:04.960]  Many of us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday,
[1:43:04.960 --> 1:43:10.640]  that the sky would fall, the market would drop two or three thousand points the first day,
[1:43:10.640 --> 1:43:16.080]  another couple thousand the second day, and a few members were even told that there would be
[1:43:16.080 --> 1:43:24.080]  martial law in America if we voted no. Martial law is defined as the rule by military authorities
[1:43:24.080 --> 1:43:30.800]  imposed on a civilian population. According to an article in the Army Times last month,
[1:43:30.800 --> 1:43:37.920]  the administration's threats of implementing martial law is not idle talk. In this shocking
[1:43:37.920 --> 1:43:43.920]  article, the US Army admits they're bringing a combat team back from Iraq to continue their mission
[1:43:44.480 --> 1:43:51.200]  in America, and that this combat team will be assigned to Northcom to assist in the event of
[1:43:51.200 --> 1:44:00.320]  civil unrest in crowd control through non-lethal weaponry. This deployment is of course in direct
[1:44:00.320 --> 1:44:07.040]  violation of long-standing laws known as posicomitatis and the Insurrection Act, which strictly
[1:44:07.040 --> 1:44:16.240]  prohibit the US Army from policing American citizens on American soil. While such extraordinary
[1:44:16.240 --> 1:44:21.840]  steps toward the open implementation of martial law on the streets of America might seem like the
[1:44:21.840 --> 1:44:26.800]  Bush administration's last-ditch effort to keep the public in check while they rob the treasury
[1:44:26.800 --> 1:44:33.520]  of hundreds of billions for their banker friends, it is crucial to understand that this is only the
[1:44:33.520 --> 1:44:39.840]  final stage in a careful plan that has been unfolding for decades through both Republican
[1:44:39.840 --> 1:44:47.840]  and Democrat administrations. Government plans to suspend the Constitution and effect martial law
[1:44:47.840 --> 1:44:53.600]  have been taking place behind the scenes under continuity of government contingencies first
[1:44:53.600 --> 1:44:59.920]  exposed in the mid-1980s and raised by Congressman Jack Brooks during the Iran contra hearings.
[1:45:01.760 --> 1:45:09.040]  Colonel North, in your work at the NSC, were you not assigned at one time to work on plans for the
[1:45:09.040 --> 1:45:13.360]  continuity of government in the event of a major disaster, Mr. Chairman?
[1:45:16.800 --> 1:45:21.920]  I believe that the question touches upon a highly sensitive and classified area.
[1:45:21.920 --> 1:45:27.280]  So may I request that you not touch upon that, sir?
[1:45:28.640 --> 1:45:36.400]  I was particularly concerned, Mr. Chairman, because I read in Miami papers and several others
[1:45:37.440 --> 1:45:47.120]  that there had been a plan developed by that same agency, a contingency plan in the event of
[1:45:47.120 --> 1:45:52.080]  emergency that would suspend the American Constitution, and I was deeply concerned about it.
[1:45:52.080 --> 1:45:54.720]  I wondered if that was the area in which he had worked?
[1:45:55.600 --> 1:45:56.560]  I believe it was.
[1:45:56.560 --> 1:46:02.720]  I most respectfully request that that matter not be touched upon at this stage.
[1:46:03.520 --> 1:46:08.000]  If we wish to get into this uncertain arrangements can be made for an executive session.
[1:46:09.840 --> 1:46:15.520]  Urban warfare drills took place throughout the 90s, with American troops training with foreign
[1:46:15.520 --> 1:46:18.960]  soldiers to arrest and detain U.S. citizens.
[1:46:21.280 --> 1:46:26.800]  What you're seeing is real April 10th through April 20th in Swansborough, North Carolina.
[1:46:27.440 --> 1:46:30.800]  This has been repeated across the country in the last two years.
[1:46:30.800 --> 1:46:35.040]  So-called urban warfare training in America.
[1:46:35.840 --> 1:46:39.760]  Of course, in the case of Swansborough, they actually pulled people over and
[1:46:39.760 --> 1:46:42.240]  searched their vehicles with the local police department.
[1:46:42.240 --> 1:46:47.040]  A local listener sent me this video of the Swansborough incident.
[1:46:47.760 --> 1:46:54.080]  You see, they take out groups of young officers from across the country in the Marine Corps and
[1:46:54.080 --> 1:46:59.200]  teach them that it's okay to go into American towns and cities and take over the city halls
[1:46:59.200 --> 1:47:00.480]  and search vehicles.
[1:47:01.840 --> 1:47:04.400]  In this training exercise, it became real.
[1:47:04.400 --> 1:47:08.400]  They become so arrogant, they just follow their orders and began to search people's vehicles.
[1:47:08.400 --> 1:47:14.400]  And as you're about to find out, it's not just the Marines, it's the Army too, in central Texas.
[1:47:15.840 --> 1:47:22.000]  These drills quickly became reality, as in 2005, the National Guard was deployed in the wake of
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:29.120]  Hurricane Katrina to seize illegally held guns from law-abiding citizens against their will
[1:47:29.120 --> 1:47:30.560]  and at gunpoint.
[1:47:31.440 --> 1:47:32.800]  No one will be able to be armed.
[1:47:32.800 --> 1:47:34.560]  We will take all weapons.
[1:47:34.560 --> 1:47:35.440]  Police Department!
[1:47:35.440 --> 1:47:46.320]  All of a sudden, they were banging in the front door, the side door, and the back door.
[1:47:46.320 --> 1:47:47.680]  And they slid us in.
[1:47:50.560 --> 1:47:54.880]  I saw the sands even loaded, and I dropped it on the floor.
[1:47:56.640 --> 1:47:58.480]  Well, they punched me in the face.
[1:48:00.480 --> 1:48:02.480]  Look at my black and blue marks.
[1:48:02.480 --> 1:48:05.280]  Look at what they did to me.
[1:48:08.560 --> 1:48:15.360]  In 2006, a secret government program came to light, which is recruiting clergy members to
[1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:20.080]  preach obedience to government in the event that martial law is declared.
[1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:25.680]  In 2007, the program was confirmed on CBS News.
[1:48:25.680 --> 1:48:33.600]  If martial law weren't acted here at home, like depicted in the movie, The Siege,
[1:48:33.600 --> 1:48:36.960]  easing public fears and quelling dissent would be critical.
[1:48:36.960 --> 1:48:42.240]  And that's exactly what the Clergy Response Team, as it's called, helped accomplish in new worlds.
[1:48:42.240 --> 1:48:45.600]  Object, the primary thing that we say to anybody is, let's cooperate and get this
[1:48:45.600 --> 1:48:49.440]  thing over with, and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over.
[1:48:49.440 --> 1:48:54.000]  Such Clergy Response Teams would walk a tightrope between the needs of the government
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:55.920]  versus the wishes of the public.
[1:48:55.920 --> 1:48:59.840]  In a lot of cases, these clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods
[1:48:59.840 --> 1:49:02.960]  in which they're helping to diffuse that situation.
[1:49:02.960 --> 1:49:07.680]  For the clergy, one of the biggest tools that they will have in helping calm the public down,
[1:49:07.680 --> 1:49:14.240]  or obey the law, is the Bible itself, specifically Romans, Romans 13.
[1:49:14.240 --> 1:49:18.240]  Because the government's established about the law, you know, and that's what we believe in the
[1:49:18.240 --> 1:49:24.240]  Christian faith, that's what's stated in the scripture.
[1:49:24.240 --> 1:49:28.480]  And on May 9th, 2007, President Bush signed off on National Security Presidential Directive 51.
[1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:35.280]  This top-secret continuity of government plan effectively makes the president a dictator,
[1:49:35.280 --> 1:49:40.080]  allowing him to declare a national emergency for any reason whatsoever,
[1:49:40.080 --> 1:49:43.760]  and implement martial law without the approval of Congress.
[1:49:43.760 --> 1:49:49.760]  The plan itself is so secret that not even members of the Homeland Security
[1:49:49.760 --> 1:49:53.280]  Committee in Congress are allowed to see its contents.
[1:49:55.040 --> 1:50:00.960]  But now, they've denied the entire Homeland Security Committee of the United States House
[1:50:00.960 --> 1:50:07.920]  of Representatives access to their so-called detailed plan to provide for continuity of
[1:50:07.920 --> 1:50:12.880]  government. They say, trust us. Trust us, the people who brought us Katrina,
[1:50:12.880 --> 1:50:17.920]  to be competent in face of a disaster. Trust us, the people who brought us
[1:50:17.920 --> 1:50:23.920]  warrantless wiretapping and other excesses eroding our civil liberties. Trust us.
[1:50:25.680 --> 1:50:30.320]  These are just a few of the dozens of preparations that have already been completed
[1:50:30.320 --> 1:50:35.200]  to phase martial law in incrementally, bringing it about in stages.
[1:50:35.200 --> 1:50:39.120]  So an official declaration of military rule need not even be made.
[1:50:39.120 --> 1:50:48.240]  But if martial law is already a reality, what excuse will be used to turn the military against
[1:50:48.240 --> 1:50:53.680]  the American public? Have you heard about this new thing going on in Great Britain and Al-Qaeda?
[1:50:53.680 --> 1:51:00.160]  Wrote in that all these Britons, essentially, 1,400 strong apparently in a new what's being called
[1:51:00.160 --> 1:51:04.880]  a new white Al-Qaeda. You have doubts about the stability of the dollar or your own financial
[1:51:04.880 --> 1:51:09.600]  future? Is a dismal growth rate or rapid inflation affecting the bottom line of your retirement
[1:51:09.600 --> 1:51:14.000]  savings accounts? Do you worry about uncontrollable economic events which could suddenly wipe out
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  some or all of your hard earned savings? You can turn adversity into opportunity.
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:23.520]  Individual retirement accounts and most 401Ks, 403Bs, CEPs and other retirement plans can be
[1:51:23.520 --> 1:51:27.760]  rolled over into self-directed accounts using gold and silver. There are definitely some do's and
[1:51:27.760 --> 1:51:35.600]  don'ts with this roll over process and that's where Midas Resources comes in. Call us at 1-866-323-5665

[1:51:40.160 --> 1:51:45.200]  power even if other financial assets are failing. It's not a question of if you'll need precious
[1:51:45.200 --> 1:51:49.760]  metals in your portfolio, it's a question of when. So whether you're planning for an economic
[1:51:49.760 --> 1:51:57.600]  rainy day or a category five hurricane, the solution is the same. Call us today at 1-866-323-5665
[1:51:57.600 --> 1:52:08.080]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Grounds here and we knew
[1:52:08.080 --> 1:52:13.920]  what to do or at least we thought we did. Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally
[1:52:13.920 --> 1:52:22.320]  gives first responders a platform to tell their story. Whitman, EPA director on the 18 made a
[1:52:22.320 --> 1:52:28.880]  statement that the air was safe to breathe. This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11
[1:52:28.880 --> 1:52:34.080]  Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters. He had his
[1:52:34.080 --> 1:52:38.160]  hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear
[1:52:38.160 --> 1:52:44.320]  three, two, one and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. This is an emergency transmission
[1:52:44.320 --> 1:52:52.000]  worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:57.440]  the DVD at infowars.com. If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to
[1:52:57.440 --> 1:53:03.200]  commit more acts and bring in martial law. Would you walk around with your credit card number
[1:53:03.200 --> 1:53:08.160]  displayed on your back for anyone to read? Of course not. But if you have one of the 50 million
[1:53:08.160 --> 1:53:12.240]  new contactless credit and debit cards in circulation in your wallet, that's exactly what
[1:53:12.240 --> 1:53:16.800]  you're doing. I'm Wal Augustino, it's founder of Identity Stronghold and we think this is
[1:53:16.800 --> 1:53:21.200]  information you need to know. You may not even realize you already have one of these cards
[1:53:21.200 --> 1:53:26.160]  because they look physically just like the old card. The difference is an RFID chip hidden inside
[1:53:26.160 --> 1:53:30.480]  the card that makes radio communication with the card possible right through your wallet,
[1:53:30.480 --> 1:53:35.280]  purse or pants pocket without you ever removing the card. Pickpockets no longer even have to
[1:53:35.280 --> 1:53:40.240]  touch you to get your information. Our company realizes the privacy danger this represents
[1:53:40.240 --> 1:53:44.720]  and that's why we manufacture the secure sleeve. The secure sleeve is a patent pending card sleeve
[1:53:44.720 --> 1:53:49.600]  that contains a radio frequency barrier preventing radio signals from reaching your card. You can
[1:53:49.600 --> 1:53:56.400]  get more information and purchase the secure sleeve online at idstronghold.com. That's idstronghold.com

[1:54:08.320 --> 1:54:11.280]  Okay folks, we are back live. I'm going to go back into the
[1:54:11.280 --> 1:54:21.760]  Corbett report. Last three or four minutes of it and then I will continue to break down
[1:54:21.760 --> 1:54:25.360]  what we're going to see unfold. Stay with us.
[1:54:28.880 --> 1:54:32.080]  Have you heard about this new thing going on in Great Britain at Al Qaeda?
[1:54:32.080 --> 1:54:38.720]  Wrote up all these Britons essentially, 1400 strong apparently in a new what's being called a
[1:54:38.720 --> 1:54:44.800]  new white Al Qaeda army. Tougher to detect potentially. Because they're not Muslims,
[1:54:44.800 --> 1:54:47.840]  they look just like regular British people. They're converts.
[1:54:49.600 --> 1:54:56.560]  In 2001, section 802 of the Patriot Act made any criminal offense even misdemeanors
[1:54:56.560 --> 1:55:05.200]  classifiable as terrorist activity. In 2006, the Military Commissions Act gave the executive
[1:55:05.200 --> 1:55:11.600]  branch the authority to declare US citizens and residents unlawful enemy combatants and detain
[1:55:11.600 --> 1:55:22.960]  them in undisclosed locations indefinitely. And now HR 1955 known as the Violent Radicalization
[1:55:22.960 --> 1:55:29.280]  and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act currently awaiting passage by the Senate will effectively
[1:55:29.280 --> 1:55:37.120]  outlaw dissent of the government even on the internet. It seems the table has been set for
[1:55:37.120 --> 1:55:43.440]  those citizens who resist any government decree to be dealt with as terrorists by the US military.
[1:55:45.360 --> 1:55:50.320]  And now that the banker bailout bill has been passed despite fierce public outcry,
[1:55:50.960 --> 1:55:55.200]  dissent has never been more rife amongst the general population.
[1:55:55.200 --> 1:56:02.480]  Every nation in every region now has a decision to make.
[1:56:03.760 --> 1:56:07.680]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[1:56:07.680 --> 1:56:27.360]  Yeah, John. What's up, man? Oh, okay. Fantastic.
[1:56:30.240 --> 1:56:35.120]  Thought that clip was a little bit longer than I had thought. Well, it breaks down the basic
[1:56:35.120 --> 1:56:42.000]  facts that we were discussing earlier. And when we get back after this break,
[1:56:42.720 --> 1:56:47.520]  I am going to go through this story postponing the election. It's a joke or is it?
[1:56:49.040 --> 1:56:51.760]  But for right now, I'm just going to leave you with whatever John was to play.
[1:56:58.240 --> 1:57:02.080]  This is Aldous Huxley, a man haunted by a vision of hell on earth.
[1:57:02.080 --> 1:57:07.440]  A searing social critic, Mr. Huxley, 27 years ago, wrote Brave New World,
[1:57:08.080 --> 1:57:13.200]  a novel that predicted that someday the entire world would live under a frightful dictatorship.
[1:57:14.320 --> 1:57:19.840]  Today, Mr. Huxley says that his fictional world of horror is probably just around the corner
[1:57:19.840 --> 1:57:23.360]  for all of us. We'll find out why in a moment.
[1:57:23.360 --> 1:57:32.080]  The Mike Wallace interview presented by the American Broadcasting Company in association
[1:57:32.080 --> 1:57:36.960]  with the Fund for the Republic brings you a special television series discussing the
[1:57:36.960 --> 1:57:44.000]  problems of survival and freedom in America. Good evening. I'm Mike Wallace. Tonight's guest,
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:50.800]  Aldous Huxley, is a man of letters as disturbing as he is distinguished. Born in England, now a
[1:57:50.800 --> 1:57:55.520]  resident of California, Mr. Huxley has written some of the most electric novels and social
[1:57:55.520 --> 1:58:02.000]  criticism of this century. He's just finished a series of essays called Enemies of Freedom,
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:07.600]  in which he outlines and defines some of the threats to our freedom in the United States.
[1:58:07.600 --> 1:58:12.480]  And Mr. Huxley, right off the bat, let me ask you this. As you see it, who and what
[1:58:13.440 --> 1:58:16.720]  are the enemies of freedom here in the United States?
[1:58:16.720 --> 1:58:21.200]  Well, I don't think you can say who in the United States. I don't think there are any
[1:58:22.080 --> 1:58:27.600]  sinister persons deliberately trying to rob people of their freedom. But I do think,
[1:58:28.320 --> 1:58:34.720]  first of all, that there are a number of impersonal forces which are pushing in the direction of
[1:58:34.720 --> 1:58:40.080]  less and less freedom. And I also think that there are a number of technological devices.

[1:58:51.280 --> 1:58:57.120]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[1:58:57.120 --> 1:59:02.240]  this country. The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:59:02.240 --> 1:59:06.240]  Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to the
[1:59:06.240 --> 1:59:11.520]  Osama bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties
[1:59:11.520 --> 1:59:16.480]  to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are
[1:59:16.480 --> 1:59:23.280]  Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli
[1:59:23.280 --> 1:59:28.960]  citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI,
[1:59:28.960 --> 1:59:33.200]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games,
[1:59:33.200 --> 1:59:38.880]  the shadow government and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com.

[2:00:12.960 --> 2:00:21.920]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:25.760 --> 2:00:31.200]  We are back live already into the third hour of this worldwide broadcast. Coming up in 30 minutes,
[2:00:31.200 --> 2:00:35.040]  Bob Davis is going to be in studio with us again for the balance of the show. And we're going to
[2:00:35.040 --> 2:00:42.160]  have open phones talking about a host of issues. I want to hear from the listeners about what you
[2:00:42.160 --> 2:00:48.240]  think the depression, which is a far gone conclusion. It's guaranteed with hyperinflation now.
[2:00:48.240 --> 2:00:52.000]  What that's going to be like. Having a massively contracting real economy
[2:00:54.400 --> 2:01:02.880]  while the currency is worth less and less and less.
[2:01:02.880 --> 2:01:12.880]  What do you think that is going to be like? How are you going to respond to that? How are you
[2:01:12.880 --> 2:01:18.400]  going to respond if, let's say you have $100,000 on your farm. You've already paid over a million
[2:01:18.400 --> 2:01:28.240]  dollars over 20 years on it. And they come to you and say, you've got to pay the whole note
[2:01:28.240 --> 2:01:34.960]  right now or we're taking it. And you say, but I've got two years to pay it off. And they say,
[2:01:34.960 --> 2:01:40.080]  no, the whole note is demanded now. Or the economy gets so bad that you don't even have the money
[2:01:40.080 --> 2:01:46.080]  for the payments, just on a regular payment schedule. I mean, I have read up quite a bit
[2:01:46.080 --> 2:01:48.720]  on the Great Depression. I've talked to a lot of old folks that live through it.
[2:01:50.720 --> 2:01:53.920]  I know it was tough for people in East Texas where a lot of my family came from where they
[2:01:53.920 --> 2:01:58.160]  owned their land for generations outright. At the end of the 10-year depression, there weren't really
[2:01:58.160 --> 2:02:03.600]  any white tail deer or possums or raccoons left. People make fun of people in the country eating
[2:02:03.600 --> 2:02:08.640]  possums. It's better than the 7 million people according to university studies that starved
[2:02:08.640 --> 2:02:14.720]  to death over those 10 years. And I know I talk about this a lot. 90% of the public
[2:02:14.720 --> 2:02:23.760]  was supposedly self-sufficient during the Great Depression. Now 90 plus percent are not.
[2:02:25.280 --> 2:02:28.640]  And so we can talk all day about the new world order and how they're engineering this and how
[2:02:28.640 --> 2:02:32.160]  they're carrying it out and how they're setting up a world banking system or giving that world
[2:02:32.160 --> 2:02:39.280]  banking system governmental power. But what preparations have you made and what do you
[2:02:39.280 --> 2:02:50.880]  see happening in the future? You know, I see stories out of the Boston Globe like this one.
[2:02:50.880 --> 2:02:55.360]  Let me just read it and then comment on it. Postponing election. It's a joke or is it?
[2:02:55.920 --> 2:03:04.720]  By Alex Beam. Thank heavens for the internet. It's put the surprise back in October surprise.
[2:03:04.720 --> 2:03:08.720]  Here's how the latest big picture conspiracy theory, which has been gathering strength of the
[2:03:08.720 --> 2:03:14.800]  blogosphere, the way a hurricane feeds on the Caribbean waters. So the implication there is a
[2:03:14.800 --> 2:03:20.320]  conspiracy theory and that it's something bad like a hurricane that feeds on itself. I thought the
[2:03:20.320 --> 2:03:24.400]  president openly talking about martial law or Congress being threatened with martial law,
[2:03:24.400 --> 2:03:28.800]  they didn't pass something by the executive, which is criminal. I thought that gave it steam.
[2:03:28.800 --> 2:03:33.040]  I thought the army announcing they were going to have brigades here, not just one,
[2:03:33.040 --> 2:03:36.000]  but a whole bunch of different brigades. And they list a bunch already in action
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:40.240]  to quote, suppress the American people for civil disturbance. I thought that gave it steam.
[2:03:41.360 --> 2:03:46.000]  I thought talk of depression gave it steam. I thought the Houston Chronicle and other papers
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:52.400]  talking about FEMA camps built the American people. I thought that gave it steam. Here is the
[2:03:52.400 --> 2:03:56.080]  latest big picture conspiracy theory, which has been gathering strength on the blogosphere,
[2:03:56.080 --> 2:04:00.800]  the way a hurricane feeds on Caribbean waters. It is widely believed both online and increasingly
[2:04:00.800 --> 2:04:05.680]  offline that the Bush administration intends to declare martial law and postpone next month's
[2:04:05.680 --> 2:04:12.240]  elections to prevent Barack Obama's inevitable ascension into the Oval Office. Obviously.
[2:04:12.800 --> 2:04:17.120]  So this also sells the false idea that the majority of people talking about martial
[2:04:17.120 --> 2:04:20.640]  law think Barack Obama's a good guy and that the police state doesn't want him.
[2:04:22.160 --> 2:04:25.360]  When he is the person who's gotten three times the political contributions
[2:04:25.920 --> 2:04:30.880]  from Wall Street that John McCain has. I'm just stating a fact. I mean, he's the consummate
[2:04:30.880 --> 2:04:35.600]  insider. He's got Joe Biden in there with him, the super insider. I'm going to break this whole
[2:04:35.600 --> 2:04:41.360]  thing down and then go over real police state developments that we're facing. When we get
[2:04:41.360 --> 2:04:48.000]  back from this quick break and wide open phones for the next two hours at 1-800-259-9231,

[2:04:59.200 --> 2:05:06.720]  You know, I know exactly what you're thinking. When it comes to this economy, the banks are
[2:05:06.720 --> 2:05:12.640]  crashing, the stock market's a mess. There's the mortgage crisis. There's the lending crisis.
[2:05:12.640 --> 2:05:18.800]  There is the food and gasoline prices through the ceiling crisis. And we are paralyzed a little bit.
[2:05:18.800 --> 2:05:22.800]  We don't know exactly how to respond to it. I don't know what to say. What can you do? Do what
[2:05:22.800 --> 2:05:26.800]  you can do. That's what you do. You do what you can do. What I can do is I can put some food away.

[2:07:05.840 --> 2:07:10.160]  that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the
[2:07:10.160 --> 2:07:14.960]  water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into
[2:07:14.960 --> 2:07:20.560]  the skin. The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to

[2:07:59.600 --> 2:08:15.520]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:30.320 --> 2:08:36.160]  We have microwave cannons being delivered to police departments in the military for use against
[2:08:36.160 --> 2:08:42.720]  the American people that are illegal to be used in war against enemies. We have the head of the
[2:08:42.720 --> 2:08:47.360]  Air Force saying last year in the Associated Press, that's okay. If we use them on the American people
[2:08:47.360 --> 2:08:51.760]  then that will legitimize them as a non-lethal weapon. Then they come out last week and say,
[2:08:51.760 --> 2:08:55.520]  you know what? These actually kill people. We're going to go ahead and use it. See kind of like
[2:08:55.520 --> 2:09:01.440]  the Taser. 50,000 volts have killed more than 400 people documented in the US in the last three years
[2:09:01.440 --> 2:09:07.760]  and they say, you know what? We're going up to 75,000 volts. So you have an even better chance
[2:09:07.760 --> 2:09:11.600]  of dying and then when it kills a bunch of people they come out. The federal government comes out
[2:09:11.600 --> 2:09:17.360]  and says, oh, it's a new syndrome that people in police custody die. The Tasers have nothing to do
[2:09:17.360 --> 2:09:21.680]  with it. They just get so scared. 25-year-old men and women have heart attacks and die.
[2:09:21.680 --> 2:09:30.320]  It's the system laughing at everybody, getting the public ready for the military to be on the streets.
[2:09:31.520 --> 2:09:35.440]  But none of that has anything to do with the police state. We're just delusional and we think
[2:09:35.440 --> 2:09:41.120]  martial law is going to start in the next three weeks. No, we have said for more than a decade
[2:09:41.120 --> 2:09:47.040]  that the military has been quietly gearing up for it and that they have been quietly, you know,
[2:09:47.040 --> 2:09:51.040]  getting involved in law enforcement and now openly running urban warfare drills
[2:09:51.040 --> 2:09:54.800]  to acclimate the public. And then as we told you, they announced, okay, there'll be army
[2:09:54.800 --> 2:10:00.640]  brigades under Northcom working with all these other agencies and other military arms at the
[2:10:00.640 --> 2:10:07.920]  bottom of that Army Times article. It listed right there all the other brigades and national guard
[2:10:07.920 --> 2:10:13.120]  groups and others working with the regular army. And it's the very same groups we listed
[2:10:13.120 --> 2:10:22.080]  in police state to the takeover that I made in 2000 with the documents, with the video of them.
[2:10:22.080 --> 2:10:27.200]  So it's geared up all around you as they prepare the local police and local mayors and others to
[2:10:27.200 --> 2:10:32.080]  accept it. And if they don't like it, well, they'll just implement PDD 51, which is the governors
[2:10:32.080 --> 2:10:38.240]  and local police and local sheriffs have no authority. And that Congress has no authority,
[2:10:38.240 --> 2:10:45.760]  totally lawless, high treason, absolutely criminal on its face. They haven't entirely repealed
[2:10:45.760 --> 2:10:51.760]  Posse Commentaris. It's also illegal under federal law. They don't care. It's also illegal for C-130s
[2:10:51.760 --> 2:10:57.040]  to fly in heroin and cocaine to the US every day. But that doesn't stop the people that run this
[2:10:57.040 --> 2:11:02.960]  country postponing the election. It's a joke. Or is it Boston? Thank heavens for the internet.
[2:11:02.960 --> 2:11:10.880]  It's put the surprise back in October surprise. This theory rumored delusion dates back, that's
[2:11:10.880 --> 2:11:15.440]  his quote, almost half, almost a year and a half with the appearance of the White House
[2:11:15.440 --> 2:11:20.480]  website of National Security Presidential Directive 51, which outlined a policy for
[2:11:20.480 --> 2:11:24.640]  continuity of government in the event of a national emergency. Such emergency is defined
[2:11:24.640 --> 2:11:29.920]  as any incident that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties, damage or disruption
[2:11:29.920 --> 2:11:34.560]  severely affecting the US population, infrastructure, environment, economy or government functions.
[2:11:36.080 --> 2:11:38.560]  Economy or government functions, it goes on to say or any other.
[2:11:39.680 --> 2:11:43.920]  Emergency is defined by the president. And it goes on to say that the Congress isn't involved,
[2:11:43.920 --> 2:11:49.040]  but they don't mention that here. White House spokesman Scott Stanzels says the new directive
[2:11:49.600 --> 2:11:54.960]  supplants a Cold War emergency memorandum that is no longer valid in the post-911 world
[2:11:54.960 --> 2:11:59.840]  with the country at risk of a no-notice terror attack, but on websites with names such as
[2:12:01.120 --> 2:12:06.160]  JustinUnderCoverUp.com and AboveTopSecret.com, the public document often described as secret
[2:12:07.520 --> 2:12:15.120]  was read quite differently. Female official states Bush is planning to implement martial law
[2:12:15.120 --> 2:12:20.560]  in a headline from JustinUnderCoverUp Pelosi declared martial law last night with a September
[2:12:20.560 --> 2:12:27.280]  headline from AboveTopSecret. Well, they did under House rules and that was actually in the
[2:12:27.280 --> 2:12:30.960]  mainstream news, but see they don't link to mainstream news saying this, they link to alternative
[2:12:30.960 --> 2:12:37.520]  media to act like we're making it up. Like a much-awaited messiah, I am channeling the famous
[2:12:37.520 --> 2:12:43.200]  sociological text when prophecy fails, the date of the martial law takeover keeps moving forward.
[2:12:43.200 --> 2:12:47.280]  So that's their way of discrediting it. No, the martial law is here. Members of Congress on the
[2:12:47.280 --> 2:12:52.320]  floor saying they were threatened with physical martial law if they didn't pass it. What is that?
[2:12:53.520 --> 2:12:58.720]  This spring it was to coincide with the bombing of Iran. No, it was said that martial law could
[2:12:58.720 --> 2:13:04.480]  come in if that happened. This summer, when the devastation wrought by Hurricane Ike and the minds
[2:13:04.480 --> 2:13:11.120]  of conspiracy theorists, the current economic crisis seems like a good moment for the suspension
[2:13:11.120 --> 2:13:15.600]  of the November election. Well, there have been all these mainstream headlines about could it be
[2:13:15.600 --> 2:13:21.040]  suspended, McCain said he was suspending his campaign. The martial law paranoia has an engaging
[2:13:21.040 --> 2:13:25.680]  adjunct, the FEMA coffins story. If you Google those words, you will find pictures, videos, and
[2:13:25.680 --> 2:13:31.280]  reams of text explaining the federal emergency management agency has stockpiled 50,000 coffins.
[2:13:32.080 --> 2:13:36.240]  Or are they coffin liners or boxes? Well, no, we have the name of the company. You can link over
[2:13:36.240 --> 2:13:41.760]  to it and it's plastic coffins, but they just make a joke out of it. In anticipation of a vast
[2:13:41.760 --> 2:13:46.880]  civil disturbance, presumably triggered by the imposition of martial law, we do not have FEMA
[2:13:46.880 --> 2:13:58.480]  coffins said spokesman Debbie and the printer cut it off here. It goes on. On the one hand,
[2:13:58.480 --> 2:14:03.840]  you say, okay, this is internet madness. On the other hand, you note that Ireland's largest bookmaker,
[2:14:06.160 --> 2:14:11.120]  Patty Power is laying 21 odds that American election will be postponed. When I first checked
[2:14:11.120 --> 2:14:16.960]  the site on Tuesday, the odds were 40 to one. We've seen this movie before, right?
[2:14:16.960 --> 2:14:25.920]  Writer Ron Rosenbaum remembers in the 1972 story a veering that Richard Nixon asked the
[2:14:25.920 --> 2:14:30.320]  Rand Corporation to study whether he could postpone that election, which he won handily.
[2:14:30.320 --> 2:14:35.600]  University of California historian Catherine Olmsted, author of the forthcoming Real Enemies,
[2:14:35.600 --> 2:14:42.800]  Conspiracy Theories and American Democracy, World War I and 911, notes that Franklin Roosevelt's
[2:14:42.800 --> 2:14:49.520]  many enemies were convinced that he would assume dictatorial powers and cancel the election of
[2:14:49.520 --> 2:14:57.120]  1944, which he won handily. There are all kinds of trends coming together now to feed the paranoia,
[2:14:57.120 --> 2:15:02.480]  Olmsted says. The financial meltdown evokes Americans' longtime fear and hatred of bankers,
[2:15:02.480 --> 2:15:06.320]  because our forefathers knew what was going on with the bankers, but see the dumb Americans'
[2:15:06.320 --> 2:15:12.080]  hatred of them like an ancestral memory. And people on the right think Obama's candidacy might
[2:15:12.080 --> 2:15:17.200]  mean the end of civilization. What's scary to the left right now is Obama has a real chance of winning,
[2:15:17.200 --> 2:15:21.840]  and there's a segment of the far left that thinks they will never let this happen. And of course,
[2:15:21.840 --> 2:15:26.960]  there is the inconvenient animating truth. Sometimes the government does engage in real
[2:15:26.960 --> 2:15:31.040]  conspiracies like Watergate, Iran Contra, and the assassination plot against Castro.
[2:15:31.040 --> 2:15:35.760]  Olmsted explains, I'm sure you remember William S. Burrow's famous observation,
[2:15:35.760 --> 2:15:38.560]  a paranoid man is a man with all the facts at his disposal.
[2:15:41.200 --> 2:15:48.400]  And it goes on to end with, say good-bye, good night, Sarah. The Sarah palindrome
[2:15:49.120 --> 2:15:55.440]  contest is officially over. A palindrome is a word for a phrase like, Madam, I'm Adam,
[2:15:55.440 --> 2:16:00.560]  that's spelled the same way backwards and forwards. This is the last official entry
[2:16:00.560 --> 2:16:08.800]  from Little Brown copy editor, Ben Allen, harasser of taxes, a mav, a maw, sex at 4 Sarah.
[2:16:09.600 --> 2:16:13.680]  Really strange article. The judges will announce their decisions. That's just some blurb at the
[2:16:13.680 --> 2:16:21.200]  end of it. Okay. As I keep telling everybody, year after year, month after month, week after week,
[2:16:23.760 --> 2:16:29.600]  they are in a slow motion martial law, militarizing the police, building FEMA camps,
[2:16:29.600 --> 2:16:36.480]  building emergency relocation centers, training the police for riot patrol, training your children
[2:16:36.480 --> 2:16:42.160]  how to tattle on you in the public schools, tracking all of your license plates in real time
[2:16:42.160 --> 2:16:45.360]  with months and months and months of data of where you've gone, where you've been,
[2:16:45.360 --> 2:16:51.840]  where you're going. I've been telling you about that for a decade. And finally, it is in the
[2:16:51.840 --> 2:16:56.080]  Portland Tribune and other papers this week, we could all be tracked cops test license plate
[2:16:56.080 --> 2:17:00.640]  cameras that store trace data. Portland police are testing a high-tech camera system that rivals
[2:17:00.640 --> 2:17:04.560]  anything in the science fiction movie. It can reach back in time and track your movements across
[2:17:04.560 --> 2:17:09.280]  the city and even produce photos of your previous locations. And it goes on. Well, the feds put
[2:17:09.280 --> 2:17:13.600]  that in a decade ago. Started putting it in and it was complete about a year ago, as far as we
[2:17:13.600 --> 2:17:18.640]  can tell. That's why they got cameras at four-way stops in the middle of Montana or South Dakota.
[2:17:18.640 --> 2:17:23.600]  I mean, it's everywhere. It tracks you everywhere you go in real time and it's all been admitted
[2:17:23.600 --> 2:17:32.080]  in government documents. I mean, is that not a total tyranny? Is that not total big brother?
[2:17:32.720 --> 2:17:37.680]  People say, well, what do I have to hide? It's the fact that governments can abuse good people
[2:17:37.680 --> 2:17:42.080]  and good populations and use this for oppression. It's that historically governments can't be
[2:17:42.080 --> 2:17:47.120]  trusted with this type of power or anything approaching it. This is many times worse than
[2:17:47.120 --> 2:17:57.760]  anything governments have ever had before. And so while we live in martial law, with police
[2:17:57.760 --> 2:18:01.040]  asking us what we're doing, walking down the street or telling us we can't protest or we'll
[2:18:01.040 --> 2:18:04.960]  be arrested without a permit, a permit they won't issue, or all these gun control laws,
[2:18:06.560 --> 2:18:09.840]  and neighborhood watch being turned into Homeland Security Watch and the government
[2:18:09.840 --> 2:18:14.400]  hiring felons and illegal aliens into the military and police. I mean, all of that,
[2:18:14.400 --> 2:18:20.720]  that is martial law. Congress being threatened with being removed or being ignored if they
[2:18:20.720 --> 2:18:28.480]  didn't pass legislation. That happened. And it's bigger than George Bush or Barack Obama or John
[2:18:28.480 --> 2:18:36.480]  McCain. People love to put dates on something for it to magically come as if they have the police
[2:18:36.480 --> 2:18:41.600]  or the military to go round up the tens of millions of patriots in a week or a month or a year.
[2:18:41.600 --> 2:18:47.120]  It doesn't work that way. It's going to be a clamp down on counties and cities and mainstream media
[2:18:47.120 --> 2:18:52.320]  and the Congress. If Congress doesn't pass a bill, they get sent anthrax letters.
[2:18:53.680 --> 2:18:58.160]  The feds already use a backfire in the parking lot as a way to put guns to congressman's heads
[2:18:58.160 --> 2:19:02.080]  and threaten to taser them if they don't leave the Capitol. That's the federal protective force
[2:19:02.080 --> 2:19:07.120]  doing that. The executive going in with its goons and telling the congressman that they're nothing.
[2:19:07.120 --> 2:19:15.200]  It's already gone on. It's already here. Barack Obama says he wants a million man
[2:19:15.200 --> 2:19:20.160]  tattletale force and a three million man environmental tattletale squad in your home
[2:19:20.160 --> 2:19:24.400]  with your kids telling you what you can and can't do in forcing all these new environmental edicts.
[2:19:29.120 --> 2:19:35.360]  And now Barack Obama came out and said that he is for women to be drafted as well as men.
[2:19:35.360 --> 2:19:39.680]  That's in the mainstream news. And then if I say I'm against a draft, oh now I'm against
[2:19:39.680 --> 2:19:44.800]  Barack Obama. No, he's a front man. He's not the McDonald's corporation. He's the person at the
[2:19:44.800 --> 2:19:49.680]  drive-thru window you talk to. The point is the establishment doesn't just want to draft men.
[2:19:49.680 --> 2:19:54.480]  They want to draft women and they've reactivated the draft boards. But see now, if you're against
[2:19:54.480 --> 2:19:58.720]  the draft, you're against black people. See, it has nothing to do with that. These are the mindless
[2:19:58.720 --> 2:20:05.840]  games they play. You invest, you buy insurance, you wear your seatbelt, you do things to ensure
[2:20:05.840 --> 2:20:10.960]  your family's future and protection. But why? Just in case? With the current state of affairs,
[2:20:10.960 --> 2:20:15.600]  ask yourself, am I ready? Preparation starts at survivalgearsource.com.

[2:21:01.600 --> 2:21:07.360]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[2:21:07.360 --> 2:21:12.480]  this country. The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:21:12.480 --> 2:21:17.680]  Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:21:17.680 --> 2:21:21.920]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to
[2:21:21.920 --> 2:21:26.720]  intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are
[2:21:26.720 --> 2:21:33.520]  Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli
[2:21:33.520 --> 2:21:39.200]  citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI,
[2:21:39.200 --> 2:21:43.440]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games,
[2:21:43.440 --> 2:21:49.200]  the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com
[2:21:49.200 --> 2:21:54.560]  or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:21:54.560 --> 2:21:58.080]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[2:22:01.760 --> 2:22:07.040]  Cameras are everywhere, above stoplights on toll booths and scanning the freeways just waiting
[2:22:07.040 --> 2:22:12.400]  to snap a photo of your license plate only to slam you with ridiculous fines. In California,
[2:22:12.400 --> 2:22:18.160]  red light tickets are as high as $400. Spray your plate is a spray on photo blocker that protects
[2:22:18.160 --> 2:22:23.360]  against all types of cameras. Spray your plate photo blocker spray reflects and protects against
[2:22:23.360 --> 2:22:28.560]  flash photo images making your plate unreadable. One can of photo blocker will pay for itself

[2:23:24.000 --> 2:23:29.440]  Executive order 11,110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank
[2:23:29.440 --> 2:23:33.440]  of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest. With the stroke of a
[2:23:33.440 --> 2:23:38.080]  pen Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business. The November assassination quieted the production
[2:23:38.080 --> 2:23:43.120]  of the new currency. However, the executive order still stands unrepealed. Midas has the Kennedy
[2:23:43.120 --> 2:23:52.560]  versus Fed document. Call 800-686-2237. Unlike your liberty, the paper is free. Call 800-686-2237.

[2:24:22.560 --> 2:24:35.200]  The end of the morning. Now there's one more song. Think about the woman, the girl you knew the night before.
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:50.640]  But you'd also soon be wandering the way they always do. When you're riding 16 hours, there's nothing
[2:24:50.640 --> 2:24:58.720]  more to do. And you don't feel much like riding. You just wish the trip was through.
[2:24:58.720 --> 2:25:01.520]  All right. Bob Davis is going to be with us in the next segment. We'll take your calls for the
[2:25:01.520 --> 2:25:06.240]  next hour and a half with him as well. We're talking about the North American Union. They're
[2:25:06.240 --> 2:25:10.400]  taking over the infrastructure, the roads, the ports, handing it over. Some P5s happening here
[2:25:10.400 --> 2:25:16.640]  in central Texas. Here is the article. It's out of the Pittsburgh Post Gazette.
[2:25:16.640 --> 2:25:24.080]  It's candidates that differ on female draft. And it goes on from there.
[2:25:26.800 --> 2:25:31.760]  It goes on from there with, even as the U.S. confronts two long wars, neither Senator John
[2:25:31.760 --> 2:25:35.360]  McCain or Senator Barack Obama believes the country should take the politically perilous
[2:25:35.360 --> 2:25:42.000]  step of reviving the military draft. Oh, but then you look at all the draft boards being set back up.
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:46.560]  You see the draft board heads being said that on record that they've been told to get ready for
[2:25:46.560 --> 2:25:51.440]  a draft. You hear them saying that if we go into Iran, we'll need a draft. But the two presidential
[2:25:51.440 --> 2:25:59.760]  candidates disagree on the key foundation of any draft. But they just said they weren't for it.
[2:25:59.760 --> 2:26:04.160]  Mr. Obama supports a requirement for both men and women to register with the Selective Service,
[2:26:04.160 --> 2:26:08.400]  which is registering for the draft. Well, Mr. McCain doesn't think women should have to register.
[2:26:08.400 --> 2:26:14.800]  Also, Mr. Obama will consider officially opening combat positions to women. Mr. McCain will not.
[2:26:14.800 --> 2:26:18.960]  Women are already serving in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, and with the current policy
[2:26:18.960 --> 2:26:25.680]  should be updated to reflect realities on the ground, said Wendy Morgie. Mr. Obama's
[2:26:25.680 --> 2:26:29.920]  National Security Spokeswoman, Barack Obama, will consult with military commanders to review
[2:26:29.920 --> 2:26:35.760]  the constraints that remain. According to his campaign, Mr. McCain supports the current Defense
[2:26:35.760 --> 2:26:39.520]  Department restrictions on women in combat units, including armor, field artillery, and special
[2:26:39.520 --> 2:26:46.160]  forces. Okay, Selective Service, ladies and gentlemen, is for the draft. And that's one of the
[2:26:46.160 --> 2:26:53.520]  greatest forms of martial law is conscription, to force people to come in and join the military,
[2:26:54.400 --> 2:26:57.920]  and what our military's bought and paid for by foreign interest and go and serve
[2:26:57.920 --> 2:27:01.920]  in all these criminal wars. And they wanted to have a, quote, volunteer military. Now they're
[2:27:01.920 --> 2:27:06.240]  shifting it over to mainly contractors and drones, so it can be robotically controlled,
[2:27:06.240 --> 2:27:10.880]  and people at airfields can just load the drones with their bombs, with their hellfire missiles.
[2:27:12.640 --> 2:27:18.640]  So we'll get Bob Desi's take on the national draft and the economy as well coming up. But
[2:27:18.640 --> 2:27:25.760]  I want to get your take on the economy, the national draft, what's happening as well when we
[2:27:25.760 --> 2:27:33.600]  get back later in this hour. But let it be said here that we are already under martial law,
[2:27:33.600 --> 2:27:41.280]  but it's what degree, say on a scale of one to 100, we're at about a 60 on the scale for martial
[2:27:41.280 --> 2:27:45.760]  law, 90 to 100, you know, being troops rounding people up house to house.
[2:27:48.480 --> 2:27:53.120]  And I have no doubt that under a major depression, a deepening depression, years into a depression,
[2:27:53.120 --> 2:27:58.160]  this continues, that things will be so bad and the media will be so controlled. You won't be
[2:27:58.160 --> 2:28:02.160]  hearing shows like this. They're talking about regulating and restricting and taxing and shutting
[2:28:02.160 --> 2:28:06.800]  down the web and certifying who can have websites and who can be on air and having a congressional
[2:28:06.800 --> 2:28:13.360]  body under the domestic terrorist act or trying to pass the homegrown radicalization act.
[2:28:13.360 --> 2:28:18.320]  I mean, all of this is happening. Congress is being told martial law will be declared.
[2:28:18.320 --> 2:28:24.240]  The police are being told this. It's in the news. 26,000 preachers have been hired secretly by FEMA.
[2:28:24.240 --> 2:28:28.960]  Now it's public. It's a big deal that we told you a year and a half beforehand to train their flocks,
[2:28:28.960 --> 2:28:34.720]  to hand in their guns, not fight back, to go to FEMA camps. The media lies every year in the
[2:28:34.720 --> 2:28:38.320]  late summer and tells you it's the law. You've got to go take all these inoculations to go to
[2:28:38.320 --> 2:28:44.080]  school when there is no law, that you've got to have the inoculations. When you have fraud by
[2:28:44.080 --> 2:28:48.080]  government and tyranny and when the government doesn't carry out the will of the people or the
[2:28:48.080 --> 2:28:53.280]  Constitution, that is tyranny and martial law. When we know that all over the country there's
[2:28:53.280 --> 2:28:58.320]  electronic voting machines that have been caught in fraud, being remote controlled, stealing elections,
[2:28:58.320 --> 2:29:05.200]  and nothing's done about it, that is martial law. That is tyranny. And so we are in martial law and
[2:29:05.200 --> 2:29:09.360]  we're going into deepening martial law and as Ron Paul and many others have said, it is financial
[2:29:09.360 --> 2:29:16.320]  dictatorship and financial martial law that we see in the banker takeover bill. And now what are
[2:29:16.320 --> 2:29:20.640]  they announcing? A new world order banking system and you'll buy your carbon credit,
[2:29:20.640 --> 2:29:26.880]  global taxes from them, a tax based on human activity. You think the income tax is bad? This
[2:29:26.880 --> 2:29:34.240]  is far worse. So it's all coming up in the next segment with Bob Desi, our guest in studio,
[2:29:34.240 --> 2:29:40.720]  post the simple truth here locally in Austin now for nine years, also writes for the new American
[2:29:40.720 --> 2:29:46.640]  magazine nationally and internationally. Bob Desi on the front line of fighting the North
[2:29:46.640 --> 2:29:54.560]  American Union and the NAFTA superhighways stay with us. We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[2:29:54.560 --> 2:30:04.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:30:08.720 --> 2:30:11.520]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the new world order?
[2:30:11.520 --> 2:30:15.840]  How do the American people know that not 11 was the state? It was engineered by you,
[2:30:15.840 --> 2:30:18.720]  David Boncafella, the fallout or commission, the CAFR.
[2:30:18.720 --> 2:30:25.280]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of
[2:30:25.280 --> 2:30:30.800]  just criticism to grow at our own door. Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[2:30:30.800 --> 2:30:37.360]  a global awakening has taken place. An inside job. How dare you?
[2:30:40.480 --> 2:30:44.000]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:30:44.000 --> 2:30:48.960]  Paul Helen is breaking news on Sixth Avenue. And if the government has not told the truth
[2:30:48.960 --> 2:30:52.320]  in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of...

[2:32:52.480 --> 2:32:57.040]  the Radio Show with Bob Desi, with us in studio for the next hour and a half.
[2:32:57.040 --> 2:33:02.240]  We're live at PrisonPlanet.tv for the Balanced of the Radio Show the next hour and 27 minutes.
[2:33:03.680 --> 2:33:08.560]  We're going to be talking about the economy, the banker takeover that's taking place,
[2:33:08.560 --> 2:33:12.640]  the immunity they're getting, the open discussions of martial law where the public
[2:33:12.640 --> 2:33:16.560]  sees the troops going on the streets of America. Here's they're going to be used for riot control
[2:33:16.560 --> 2:33:21.600]  and crowd control. That is martial law. The Army's telling everybody that. They're saying we're
[2:33:21.600 --> 2:33:26.800]  working with the police, you know, the decades of having the police and military and urban
[2:33:26.800 --> 2:33:31.440]  warfare drills. And now the last eight years of the military checking bags at high school,
[2:33:31.440 --> 2:33:36.480]  college and NFL football games, the Kentucky Derby and any other high-profile event getting
[2:33:36.480 --> 2:33:41.360]  you prepared. They're admitting it was preparing you. And Homeland Security had Ridge and now
[2:33:41.360 --> 2:33:44.800]  Chertoff saying they want to use the U.S. military against the American people. And
[2:33:44.800 --> 2:33:48.400]  the gun confiscation in New Orleans and surrounding areas. Now gun confiscation in
[2:33:48.400 --> 2:33:52.800]  Illinois with the governor a month ago coming out and saying, yeah, we're going to use the
[2:33:52.800 --> 2:33:57.440]  Army to do door-to-door gun confiscation. The knock and talk where the police come to your
[2:33:57.440 --> 2:34:00.640]  house and knock and say, do you have any guns? We want to inspect them or if it's an area where
[2:34:00.640 --> 2:34:04.480]  guns are illegal, do you have guns? We're going to come in and look, intimidating their way in.
[2:34:04.480 --> 2:34:09.680]  That is martial law. Congress being threatened. You better pass this banker takeover bill or
[2:34:09.680 --> 2:34:14.160]  we'll declare martial law. That's actually happening. And the mainstream media makes jokes
[2:34:14.160 --> 2:34:18.480]  and says, where are the troops? Where are the parachutes? Where are they taking over? Ignoring
[2:34:18.480 --> 2:34:23.280]  the fact that we told them this was all being set up and now it's being phased in incrementally.
[2:34:23.280 --> 2:34:26.720]  I want to talk about that first, Bob. Then we'll get into toll roads and everything else that's
[2:34:26.720 --> 2:34:31.760]  happening in the North American Union. We have a clip from Lou Dobbs of all places you're admitting
[2:34:31.760 --> 2:34:35.840]  they're still going ahead with the North American Union. That's coming up in a few minutes. But
[2:34:35.840 --> 2:34:39.760]  Bob Dacey, your take on everything that's happening. Well, Alex, it's kind of hard to keep
[2:34:39.760 --> 2:34:44.800]  up with it. I'm amazed at your ability to just run up, run these things off one after another,
[2:34:44.800 --> 2:34:50.080]  after another, after another. I can't keep up with it. I, you know, last two weeks ago, I was in
[2:34:50.080 --> 2:34:56.960]  the studio when they, when the Congress grew some false Cajones and devoted down the bailout.
[2:34:56.960 --> 2:35:00.960]  And you were in it pretty good to me that day. I just hope you don't burn down your desk today,
[2:35:00.960 --> 2:35:05.920]  like you almost did last time. I hope you're a little bit more serious today. And I was burning
[2:35:05.920 --> 2:35:10.560]  the dollar on there. Yeah, burning a dollar on there with a stack of papers underneath.
[2:35:10.560 --> 2:35:16.720]  You know, he's a brave guy, ladies and gentlemen. No, I, I just think that it's nuts, just insane.
[2:35:16.720 --> 2:35:21.920]  And that's all there is to it. And it's not by accident. You know, one of the things about this
[2:35:21.920 --> 2:35:27.520]  financial thing, you know, I was taught that these guys, you know, at Morgan Stanley and
[2:35:27.520 --> 2:35:34.400]  old Dean Witter and, and who was the old crotchety guy that said, we, we earned money the old
[2:35:34.400 --> 2:35:40.000]  fashion way. We earn it, you know, whichever one that was, you know, these guys are supposed
[2:35:40.000 --> 2:35:45.680]  to be pretty smart. And for all these financial firms to, to, we earn money the old fashion way,
[2:35:45.680 --> 2:35:50.400]  we steal it, steal it. Yeah. Well, you know, for all these guys that are supposed to be so smart,
[2:35:50.400 --> 2:35:56.000]  and the first, the first thing they tell you as an investor is diversify, diversify for all these
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:36:03.600]  guys. Long haul, long run. Yeah. And for all these guys to, to, to screw up simultaneously and get
[2:36:03.600 --> 2:36:09.360]  involved in this derivative nonsense and these mortgages to the extent that it actually, if it
[2:36:09.360 --> 2:36:15.360]  goes south, takes down their whole company. I mean, you, you would have to believe that all
[2:36:15.360 --> 2:36:20.320]  these people are stupid in order to do that. You're supposed to take, but no, they have been openly
[2:36:20.320 --> 2:36:25.600]  moving the money into other accounts into personal assets. Now they're just imploding the front
[2:36:25.600 --> 2:36:31.200]  company. Well, what I'm saying is that you would have to be an idiot to take all your stuff and
[2:36:31.200 --> 2:36:36.960]  put it in one risky basket such that if it goes south, your entire operation goes down.
[2:36:36.960 --> 2:36:41.120]  Therefore, I would conclude that they did it on purpose. Well, then we have all the documents
[2:36:41.120 --> 2:36:44.480]  where they did do it on purpose and they didn't just, and now they're admitting, we may use the
[2:36:44.480 --> 2:36:49.840]  army of their riots. We just so happen to secretly train them over two decades for this now and have
[2:36:49.840 --> 2:36:55.840]  all these secret relationships we've set up. Yeah. You know, like I say, they're, they're not dumb.
[2:36:55.840 --> 2:37:02.640]  And I can't, I just, I am baffled. You know, the stock market's jumped up about 600 points today.
[2:37:02.640 --> 2:37:06.800]  I guess they're trying to get more idiots to, to think, oh, everything's fine now. Everything's
[2:37:06.800 --> 2:37:10.560]  fine now. They printed a bunch of money out of thin air and they're going to bail out,
[2:37:10.560 --> 2:37:14.400]  they're going to bail out the bankers and everything. And we're going to do bait and
[2:37:14.400 --> 2:37:19.120]  switch on you and everything is fine. Remember, Alex, two weeks ago, the big deal was Bernanke
[2:37:19.120 --> 2:37:25.760]  said that the idea was we get our 700 billion and what we do is we buy the mortgages and that's
[2:37:25.760 --> 2:37:30.400]  the cause of the problem. And we buy the mortgages that close to face value and therefore everything
[2:37:30.400 --> 2:37:33.920]  will be great, right? And then all of a sudden they do the bait and switch. Oh, we're going to buy,
[2:37:33.920 --> 2:37:37.840]  we're going to buy principal in the company. Instead of, instead of, they haven't bought
[2:37:37.840 --> 2:37:42.560]  any mortgage, wait, now that we got the money and now that we got the, the, the, the Cajone less
[2:37:42.560 --> 2:37:47.200]  Congress to do what we wanted them to do now, wait, wait, forget about the mortgages. Now we're
[2:37:47.200 --> 2:37:50.960]  going to, we're going to own the banks. Now we're going to buy interest into the banks. It's bait
[2:37:50.960 --> 2:37:55.280]  and switch and retail. You call that bait and switch, Alex. That's where they tell you one
[2:37:55.280 --> 2:37:58.720]  thing. You do it and then they switch you to something else when you get there. You know,
[2:37:58.720 --> 2:38:03.040]  oh, but, and they also told us, you know, the, if we don't do this bailout, we're all going to die.
[2:38:03.040 --> 2:38:06.560]  You know, the market's going to plunge. And so they did the bailout, the market plunged anyway.
[2:38:06.560 --> 2:38:12.400]  Of course it was going to plunge, you know, but now what, the other day, what today or yesterday,
[2:38:12.400 --> 2:38:20.160]  a Mitsubishi loaned Morgan Stanley or bought into $9 billion. And now everything's just fine.
[2:38:20.160 --> 2:38:23.040]  Everything's just fine. Go home, relax, everybody. Don't worry about it.
[2:38:23.040 --> 2:38:27.200]  And now they're saying they're going to buy into private companies, but the little central
[2:38:27.200 --> 2:38:32.160]  group of bankers, they're going to decide where government taxpayer is put. And then the, and
[2:38:32.160 --> 2:38:36.960]  then the owners of those companies, they get the benefits, we get devalued currency and
[2:38:36.960 --> 2:38:40.880]  have to pay it back in tax money. Yeah. And they're getting this money from two places,
[2:38:40.880 --> 2:38:46.480]  right? They're getting this money one from, from us eventually through the, the tax, the taxation
[2:38:46.480 --> 2:38:50.640]  thing of inflation, where your money just keeps dissolving around you and you can't figure out
[2:38:50.640 --> 2:38:55.200]  why. And the other thing is they're just, they're just printing some of it out of thin air, which
[2:38:55.200 --> 2:39:00.160]  is, which is inflation. I mean, and of course they're going to taxes some more to pay for all
[2:39:00.160 --> 2:39:04.480]  of our free stuff, which we're going to get when Obama takes over. You know, it's going to be great.
[2:39:04.480 --> 2:39:09.040]  I mean, I don't know, you know, it's insane. The insanity is institutionalized.
[2:39:09.040 --> 2:39:12.800]  But you call it insane. It's, it's diabolically insane.
[2:39:12.800 --> 2:39:16.800]  It's diabolical because for people that are on the outside, who have a good worldview,
[2:39:16.800 --> 2:39:21.520]  want to help people who want to live in a secure economy, a true free market, it looks insane.
[2:39:21.520 --> 2:39:25.760]  But to these robber barons, they need to destroy economies to be able to consolidate them.
[2:39:25.760 --> 2:39:31.040]  Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's a controlled, it's a controlled emplosion. I buy analogy to this
[2:39:31.040 --> 2:39:36.560]  thing is, okay, our financial house is on fire, right? Okay. So what do we do? We call the fire
[2:39:36.560 --> 2:39:41.600]  department. Problem is we don't know that the fire department employs arsonists. Okay. So now you
[2:39:41.600 --> 2:39:45.040]  get a bunch of arsonists dressed up like firemen. They get in there, they get in their little suits
[2:39:45.040 --> 2:39:48.880]  and they get in their little fire truck and they drive to the fire to put out the fire.
[2:39:48.880 --> 2:39:53.360]  And so they hook up their hoses and we're saying, yeah, they're going to save our financial house,
[2:39:53.360 --> 2:39:56.720]  which is on fire. And instead what they're doing is they're spraying it with gasoline.
[2:39:57.520 --> 2:40:01.120]  That's, that's what's going on. And then the fire spreads and they say, we need more firemen.
[2:40:01.120 --> 2:40:06.480]  Oh, more guys give us more taxes because the fire is spreading. Meanwhile, it's only securing the
[2:40:06.480 --> 2:40:11.360]  central banks and ensuring and implodes the real economy. So coming out on the end of it,
[2:40:11.360 --> 2:40:15.440]  only the central banks are in a good position. They have all the liquidity. They've cut off
[2:40:15.440 --> 2:40:18.880]  the liquidity to the public and they're able to come in and buy everything up. They're creating
[2:40:18.880 --> 2:40:24.000]  a depression in the real economy while giving unlimited liquidity in our name to themselves.
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:28.080]  Do you see what they're doing? Absolutely. I mean, what other explanation is there for it? I mean,
[2:40:28.080 --> 2:40:34.800]  they are not trying to stop this. They are making it worse. Every, every way you look. Oh, we need
[2:40:34.800 --> 2:40:40.240]  another 150 Pelosi. We need another hundred. Oh, we need another 150 billion y'all. Okay. Come on.
[2:40:40.240 --> 2:40:43.840]  Let's go. Oh, and we're going to bail out these guys and those guys. Oh, hey, well,
[2:40:43.840 --> 2:40:48.080]  they're saying now they're saying they're going to bail out individual investors. Well, yeah,
[2:40:48.080 --> 2:40:52.960]  only select ones. Me too. Me too. You know, and then of course, you know, the Democrats go,
[2:40:52.960 --> 2:40:55.760]  well, we need to bail out these idiots that borrowed all this money that they couldn't
[2:40:55.760 --> 2:40:59.360]  buy back too. Okay. So we're going to bail out the guys that hold the mortgage that home,
[2:40:59.360 --> 2:41:02.720]  the home, the properties that couldn't afford to buy them in the first place and that'll make it
[2:41:02.720 --> 2:41:07.200]  okay. We just, just keep dumping money on top of everything. And what that's going to do is fully
[2:41:07.200 --> 2:41:12.320]  devalue the currency faster. Absolutely. But you know, it's, you know, pick your poison. I mean,
[2:41:12.320 --> 2:41:17.200]  they are doing this on, they don't know what else to do. That's all. And out of the crisis it creates,
[2:41:17.200 --> 2:41:21.760]  you're going to have more crime, a bigger police state, the riots will start and the public will
[2:41:21.760 --> 2:41:26.800]  beg for physical hot martial law, not the incremental martial law. I just want to know
[2:41:26.800 --> 2:41:32.480]  that this warm fuzzy thing of this military outfit that just came back from Iraq going to help.
[2:41:32.480 --> 2:41:34.960]  I mean, what have they been doing? Well, if you read at the end of the Army times,
[2:41:34.960 --> 2:41:38.320]  it lists a bunch of other brigades that are already active in the US. So the question is,
[2:41:38.320 --> 2:41:43.120]  what are these guys going to do? Well, they tell us they're going to do riot control for civil
[2:41:43.120 --> 2:41:47.840]  unrest and use microwave guns on us. Well, on earth would we have any of that? But then
[2:41:48.560 --> 2:41:53.600]  Wired Magazine comes out and they announced the army admits that the guess what the microwave
[2:41:53.600 --> 2:42:00.560]  gun is lethal, Bob. You mean like the tasers are lethal? Yeah. Well, you know, you got to break a
[2:42:00.560 --> 2:42:03.760]  few eggs. Well, what will happen is just like what tasers when they kill you with them, they say,
[2:42:03.760 --> 2:42:08.720]  well, he didn't die from the 15 tasers shocks we gave him. Well, when they microwave gun people
[2:42:08.720 --> 2:42:12.400]  and they die, they'll just say, well, we happen to be microwave gunning them, but they just fell
[2:42:12.400 --> 2:42:17.520]  over dead. Well, he just, he has a new syndrome. Well, you heard that all these young people dying
[2:42:17.520 --> 2:42:22.640]  for in and around tasers. It's a syndrome, Bob. He stayed out in the sun too long and got a tan.
[2:42:22.640 --> 2:42:27.280]  That's what it was. He was killed by overturning. They're going to come up with something. I don't
[2:42:27.280 --> 2:42:31.360]  know. It was kind of like they say, we're not for a national draft. We're for national compulsory
[2:42:31.360 --> 2:42:36.720]  service. Yeah, that's what Mussolini and Hitler were all about. National service. You know, we
[2:42:36.720 --> 2:42:43.120]  serve the state rather than the state serves us, right? Absolutely. Crazy. Bob, what do you think
[2:42:43.120 --> 2:42:48.080]  about all the talk of martial law? I mean, people keep thinking it's going to come in one big spurt.
[2:42:48.080 --> 2:42:54.880]  It's already here. Well, you know, it's incremental and it's not like it's not like red dawn. You
[2:42:54.880 --> 2:43:00.800]  know, people think it's got to be red dawn. You got to have Cubans parachuting from out of the
[2:43:00.800 --> 2:43:07.120]  sky and blasting people at the neighborhood school and little guys, teenagers running off
[2:43:07.120 --> 2:43:10.960]  in their pickup truck and going by the general store and grabbing guns and supplies and heading
[2:43:10.960 --> 2:43:17.760]  off for the hills. That's TV. That is just TV. You know, that's Charlie Sheen. Yeah, Mark, Mark,
[2:43:17.760 --> 2:43:24.560]  yeah. Hey, you know that that Wolverine blue sports jacket he wears? Yeah, I got that. Oh,
[2:43:24.560 --> 2:43:28.640]  you did. Oh, how about that? God, I'm so jealous. I think I'm going to bring that in and show it
[2:43:28.640 --> 2:43:33.040]  on TV because I was watching red dawn clips on YouTube last week and I'm like, there's my jacket.
[2:43:33.040 --> 2:43:36.560]  There's my jacket. There's my jacket when he's like up at the camp talking to his dad at the
[2:43:36.560 --> 2:43:40.560]  side of the camp. Well, you know, martial law, you know, well, what is accurate in the movie is
[2:43:40.560 --> 2:43:46.080]  everybody's spying and they're in the hardware store and they're saying, don't you know,
[2:43:46.080 --> 2:43:49.520]  everybody's looking for you. But see, now it'd be a face scanning camera would pick you up right
[2:43:49.520 --> 2:43:54.160]  away. I'll tell you, you know, in a real world scenario, this is really minor, but in my business,
[2:43:54.160 --> 2:43:58.480]  you don't have a local hardware store here in town. I'm the true value guy in Austin, Texas, right?
[2:43:58.480 --> 2:44:05.920]  A few months ago, one of my customers that does apartment complex management sent a letter out
[2:44:05.920 --> 2:44:10.960]  to everybody, including us and said, if you don't run your employers, employees through the
[2:44:11.520 --> 2:44:15.840]  Department of Homeland Security, we can no longer do business with you guys because,
[2:44:15.840 --> 2:44:19.520]  you know, Kevin forbid that one of our employees might intersect with one of your
[2:44:19.520 --> 2:44:23.360]  employees might be a terrorist when they set it up. That's what Ridge said. You're going to have to
[2:44:23.360 --> 2:44:27.600]  be Homeland Security approved for any job. It's really and it's ridiculous. I mean, can you imagine
[2:44:27.600 --> 2:44:31.840]  that? But they do it through selective enforcement. We can go to the hardware store to pick up them
[2:44:31.840 --> 2:44:37.360]  toilet parts because their employees might be members of I'll cater and that'll endanger our
[2:44:37.360 --> 2:44:41.840]  people at the return home or whatever. See, that's added bureaucracy to shut your company down.
[2:44:41.840 --> 2:44:47.600]  It's a crock is what it is. So are you going to do it? No, absolutely not. You know, I look at
[2:44:47.600 --> 2:44:53.040]  that and I said, well, that's just too bad. I'm not going to submit to that. You know, yeah, you know,
[2:44:53.040 --> 2:44:57.600]  the the ball cock is leaking over there at apartment three C and we got to go to got to go to
[2:44:57.600 --> 2:45:01.920]  home depot because because they get the other employees ran through Homeland Security and
[2:45:01.920 --> 2:45:06.800]  they're not members of I'll cater. Meanwhile, I know the manager of the biggest department complex
[2:45:06.800 --> 2:45:12.480]  in Austin. She was told four years ago over enforced on citizens, but illegal aliens let
[2:45:12.480 --> 2:45:17.120]  them break any rules as many as they want the apartments because we've been given a secret
[2:45:17.120 --> 2:45:22.080]  federal grant, a tax break to do it. And then it can later a year after came out in the paper
[2:45:22.080 --> 2:45:26.880]  that big insurance companies were giving breaks and the feds were giving tax breaks
[2:45:27.600 --> 2:45:33.920]  to to to companies and to different systems to quote, help the illegal aliens and the AP
[2:45:33.920 --> 2:45:38.560]  reported they were being given preferential treatment on home loans and card loans because
[2:45:38.560 --> 2:45:42.880]  the government wanted to help the illegal aliens. Well, you know, Bush signed my point is it's not
[2:45:42.880 --> 2:45:46.880]  for our safety. Well, you know, Bush signed a bill. I wish I knew I wish I remember where this
[2:45:46.880 --> 2:45:51.600]  clip was on the internet. But several years ago, Bush was signing a bill bragging about how they
[2:45:51.600 --> 2:45:55.840]  were going to encourage all these people that couldn't afford homes to get these 100% mortgages
[2:45:55.840 --> 2:46:01.200]  with these variable variable rates and how it was going to do good for them and and encourage
[2:46:01.200 --> 2:46:05.200]  home ownership and and cause that was a big setup so they could pop up the derivatives.
[2:46:05.200 --> 2:46:09.760]  Absolutely. They sell the bad loan. Yeah, it's a crop. It, you know, what does that come from?
[2:46:09.760 --> 2:46:13.280]  The whole thing comes from these people. The government did this and now they're going to
[2:46:13.280 --> 2:46:18.960]  take over. Look at this army orders, pain ray trucks, new report shows potential for death.
[2:46:18.960 --> 2:46:24.800]  That's Wired magazine. And when you read the article, it says, oh, yeah, it kills you.
[2:46:25.520 --> 2:46:29.680]  It's going to kill you just like they go on and say, but rubber bullets kill a good percentage
[2:46:29.680 --> 2:46:35.200]  of those and sell the tasers. So it's okay. We still call it non lethal. But but they're really
[2:46:35.200 --> 2:46:40.640]  called active denial systems. They're really called less lethal weapons. And they're going to
[2:46:40.640 --> 2:46:44.640]  deploy these to police departments. The army is going to have them for use against the American
[2:46:44.640 --> 2:46:49.520]  people. How does that sound, Bob? That sounds just wonderful. Absolutely. Because, you know,
[2:46:49.520 --> 2:46:54.000]  it'll be good for us. It'll be good for us. And then our neighbors will be, we'll be snitching
[2:46:54.000 --> 2:46:57.680]  on us the whole time. We'll have, we'll have Gladys Kravitz going around peeking over her
[2:46:57.680 --> 2:47:04.960]  fence going, those people over there. I think I saw a gun in their living room. Ah, you know,
[2:47:04.960 --> 2:47:09.680]  I mean, it's crazy. I mean, like I say, I cannot keep up with it. I don't see how you keep up with
[2:47:09.680 --> 2:47:14.240]  it. I really don't. Well, they're training kids in the US and England to be quote climate cops.
[2:47:14.240 --> 2:47:17.920]  It was in the New York Times saying it was good as the five year olds denounced their
[2:47:17.920 --> 2:47:22.400]  mommies and daddies. And it's in the school has them write dossiers on them about their
[2:47:22.400 --> 2:47:26.160]  environmental crimes. And now they're already switching it over to drugs, guns, what's in
[2:47:26.160 --> 2:47:31.200]  the medicine cabinet, Austin schools, I have this on video, it's in road attorney, teach the kids
[2:47:31.200 --> 2:47:35.680]  to go and look in the medicine cabinet and write down what's in it when they're in the sixth grade.
[2:47:35.680 --> 2:47:40.480]  I mean, land of the free home with a brave man years of all the government is pushing
[2:47:40.480 --> 2:47:44.640]  the prescription drugs on the kids and shipping the narcotics in that's that's new freedom,
[2:47:44.640 --> 2:47:49.360]  though. That's okay. Years ago in Austin, there was an article in the statesman where they were
[2:47:49.360 --> 2:47:54.000]  they were telling us and that they weren't joking that if your kid goes over to the new kid's house
[2:47:54.000 --> 2:47:59.600]  and there's a rusty flintlock on the top of the fireplace, you need to maybe think about talking
[2:47:59.600 --> 2:48:04.160]  to the kids parents because there's a gun in the house. I mean, they do this kind of there's all
[2:48:04.160 --> 2:48:08.480]  these women that make men, they marry, get their guns out of the house. Let me explain something.
[2:48:08.480 --> 2:48:11.520]  Someone, number one, I wouldn't marry a woman like that who couldn't protect my children,
[2:48:12.240 --> 2:48:16.960]  you know, who's been totally defanged. That's not feminism, having these not need cowardly women
[2:48:16.960 --> 2:48:21.600]  that salivate when they see a black uniform and a ski mask, but hate it when they see a citizen
[2:48:21.600 --> 2:48:29.200]  owning a gun. I mean, it's amazing, but look right here. Oh, for your safety. Oh, it may cause
[2:48:29.200 --> 2:48:35.680]  death and no problem. We're going to kill you with a government. Look at this, new taser weapons
[2:48:35.680 --> 2:48:40.080]  produced for crowd control. Here's the new mass taser that taser is putting out for police to
[2:48:40.080 --> 2:48:47.040]  just zap whole crowds of people and it can kill you. But you know, it's all right. They say that
[2:48:47.040 --> 2:48:51.360]  being shocked by it, it isn't the reason you die. It's just a new phenomenon. They're not
[2:48:51.360 --> 2:48:56.240]  sure that why when you're electrocuted, you die. Bob. Well, I mean, you know, meanwhile,
[2:48:56.240 --> 2:49:00.400]  while they're doing this, they're continuing to build their next super highway and try to try
[2:49:00.400 --> 2:49:03.840]  to. We're going to cover that when we get back and take calls. But look at this, we can all be
[2:49:03.840 --> 2:49:08.560]  tracked. Cops test license plate cameras that store and trace data. I told people a decade ago
[2:49:08.560 --> 2:49:13.200]  about this, Bob, from the federal grants. Everywhere you go, even in the middle of the country side,
[2:49:13.200 --> 2:49:17.120]  you're, it's all recorded and it's all kept in a database and your tax money pays for the
[2:49:17.120 --> 2:49:21.920]  giant hard drives to save it. Everyone's being tracked everywhere. And you said that a million
[2:49:21.920 --> 2:49:27.040]  years ago, but the newspaper said it was just for traffic enforcement and things like that.
[2:49:27.040 --> 2:49:30.960]  But now they're announcing, oh, the feds with a grant. See, they build these emergency management
[2:49:30.960 --> 2:49:34.480]  centers. Then every few months they go, oh, here's a new upgrade. You can type in Alex Jones's
[2:49:34.480 --> 2:49:38.800]  Social Security Number driver's license and it pops up where he's at. Even when my
[2:49:39.760 --> 2:49:49.760]  cell phone is off, it has GPS triangulation. Real time, they know where I am. And it's the same
[2:49:49.760 --> 2:49:53.920]  thing with this real time. All Pentagon design, it's all admitted. It's, it's, it, it, it,
[2:49:53.920 --> 2:49:56.320]  the North com says it is to control us, their enemy.
[2:49:56.320 --> 2:50:01.600]  It's sad. Yeah, it really is. I just wish we could do what the hippies said back in
[2:50:01.600 --> 2:50:05.040]  the good old days, you know, not participate. But it's not just they track you with this.
[2:50:05.920 --> 2:50:08.160]  And it's not that I have anything to hide. They're a criminal government. They can't
[2:50:08.160 --> 2:50:13.840]  be trusted with this. They'll abuse it. It's that this also fries your brain. This also sends out
[2:50:14.400 --> 2:50:19.280]  microwaves. That's why I don't even use the carry my cell phone on me anymore.
[2:50:19.280 --> 2:50:25.040]  Happened to have it today. Notice I don't have the newest trendy. I have a three year old cell
[2:50:25.040 --> 2:50:30.080]  phone. I'm not stylish. All right, Bob Dacey, stay there. We're going to come back. Alex Jones
[2:50:30.080 --> 2:50:34.800]  here with a question. What does humidity mean to you? Most people think of hot and sticky summer
[2:50:34.800 --> 2:50:39.680]  days, but many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure

[2:51:28.240 --> 2:51:35.280]  today. A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[2:51:35.280 --> 2:51:41.600]  this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is
[2:51:41.600 --> 2:51:46.320]  his M.O. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden. Fabled enemies
[2:51:46.320 --> 2:51:50.960]  is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[2:51:50.960 --> 2:51:56.320]  inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much
[2:51:56.320 --> 2:52:03.360]  engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:52:03.360 --> 2:52:08.560]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:52:08.560 --> 2:52:13.120]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much much
[2:52:13.120 --> 2:52:19.760]  more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds

[2:53:39.520 --> 2:53:44.800]  All right, Sean, Eddie, Jimmy, Matthew, David, and others, your calls are coming up. Bob, let's
[2:53:44.800 --> 2:53:52.000]  up. You know, one big part of this globalization is 83 major federal highways. They're going
[2:53:52.000 --> 2:53:57.920]  to make international zones. You'll pay international taxes that go into the SPP Security Prosperity
[2:53:57.920 --> 2:54:04.240]  North American Integration Fund. And through that fund, they will then expand taking over
[2:54:04.240 --> 2:54:08.800]  other roads and paying off local communities. Robert Pasteur a few months ago said, oh,
[2:54:08.800 --> 2:54:12.640]  the North American Union is dead. The people exposed it and didn't like it. But meanwhile,
[2:54:12.640 --> 2:54:16.960]  they are just rampaging forward with it. Bob Desi. Well, here's the deal, Alex. You know,
[2:54:16.960 --> 2:54:22.320]  this financial catastrophe that we're going on under right now has caused some of these people
[2:54:22.320 --> 2:54:27.040]  in their financing schemes to do a little bit more to kind of come out of the closet more with some
[2:54:27.040 --> 2:54:34.080]  of their jacaterie. And we have a deal here in Austin that's basically, it's kind of like a pattern
[2:54:34.080 --> 2:54:40.800]  for the whole nation. You know, the federal money to pay for highways has been drying up on purpose.
[2:54:40.800 --> 2:54:45.680]  They've been taking it away. They've been funding their North-South corridors for quite some time
[2:54:45.680 --> 2:54:50.160]  now. And so that forces the local people to try to look scramble for more money to do the local
[2:54:50.160 --> 2:54:55.920]  projects. And of course, Austin, Texas is kind of like the pilot project for the whole thing.
[2:54:56.480 --> 2:55:02.640]  And so what you've got here is you've got all these toll roads, all this toll stuff going on,
[2:55:02.640 --> 2:55:07.200]  which is not technically the Trans-Texas Corridor or not technically the Navajo Superhighway.
[2:55:07.200 --> 2:55:12.640]  So what they tell you that you've got this local control now, you'll be able to control it with
[2:55:12.640 --> 2:55:18.960]  your local officials. Well, last year we had a big fight in Texas and we kind of put us weak
[2:55:18.960 --> 2:55:24.160]  moratorium on the Trans-Texas Corridor. That was House Bill 792, I believe, the lowest coal course
[2:55:24.160 --> 2:55:28.480]  was doing. And she's a good egg, by the way. But now we have a case in point here in Austin,
[2:55:28.480 --> 2:55:32.960]  which is nationally important. You've got the local board, which is called the Campbell Board,
[2:55:32.960 --> 2:55:39.840]  which is going to apparently, they had a vote last year to toll some roads around here, right?
[2:55:39.840 --> 2:55:45.040]  Okay. But we told them we didn't want to do it. Sarah Eckert, who was a kind of commissioner here
[2:55:45.040 --> 2:55:49.120]  in Austin, which replaced Karen Summartner, who we booted out because she was a toller,
[2:55:49.680 --> 2:55:54.800]  was she kind of flip flopped. She voted for the tolls, even though she said she wasn't a toller.
[2:55:54.800 --> 2:55:58.800]  You know, ask her, why'd you do that? And she said, well, because they blackmailed us.
[2:55:58.800 --> 2:56:04.240]  She said they promised us $900 million if we would toll the roads that we already paid for
[2:56:04.240 --> 2:56:07.440]  and, you know, improved. And they've already lied previously and said they were never going
[2:56:07.440 --> 2:56:12.480]  to put tolls on them. Yeah. And then they said they're going to give them $300 million if they
[2:56:12.480 --> 2:56:17.040]  voted not to toll. So it's a $600 million blackmail. And she wanted to be able to, she knew the
[2:56:17.040 --> 2:56:21.200]  thing was going to pass anyway, so she voted for it so she could maybe try to manipulate it a little.
[2:56:21.200 --> 2:56:26.400]  Well, she's kind of redeeming herself now, trying to, because there's a meeting tonight.
[2:56:26.400 --> 2:56:30.960]  Just kind of got sprung on us. And I know you've got an international audience, but you've got,
[2:56:30.960 --> 2:56:34.720]  you've got, this is just another co-op meeting. You can tell me about it, that being co-op.
[2:56:34.720 --> 2:56:39.280]  You've got thousands of your listeners listening right now that are in the Central Texas area.
[2:56:39.280 --> 2:56:43.120]  And if, and there's a meeting tonight at the Josie Thompson Conference Center,
[2:56:43.120 --> 2:56:46.880]  University of Texas at six o'clock down there at UT, where they always have it,
[2:56:46.880 --> 2:56:50.800]  Dean Keaton and Red River. And what is this meeting? And this meeting is what they're doing
[2:56:50.800 --> 2:56:56.160]  in, in the bill 792. They said, listen, if you're going to build the toll road,
[2:56:56.160 --> 2:57:00.640]  we want local control and we want to do a study to make sure it's financially viable.
[2:57:00.640 --> 2:57:05.360]  Well, they did a study on tolling this road east of 290 East. And they said,
[2:57:05.360 --> 2:57:08.880]  and the study said it's not financially viable. It's in the red. It's not going to work.
[2:57:09.440 --> 2:57:16.000]  So now the Campo board is meeting to try to say, well, we found the loophole where we can vote
[2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:21.360]  not to make it market viable and we can use money from another toll road to pay for it.
[2:57:21.360 --> 2:57:24.720]  It's a big con job. I want to say something. It's a con job. I want to say something about the
[2:57:24.720 --> 2:57:28.960]  locals and everybody else. They're all great people, stalwarts, but we have to go through
[2:57:28.960 --> 2:57:33.920]  this relearning process every time and we never learn. Everything they say is lies.
[2:57:33.920 --> 2:57:39.040]  It's a criminal group taking over. They've said 10 times that they weren't going to put toll roads
[2:57:39.040 --> 2:57:44.320]  in as they pass the authority for it. And so then we always get caught in the minutia
[2:57:44.320 --> 2:57:48.640]  of proving that they lied, but you got to get down there and fight. You got to get down there
[2:57:48.640 --> 2:57:52.400]  and fight. And if people will show up, I'm not saying people shouldn't go, but I got to go.
[2:57:52.400 --> 2:57:56.480]  But go realizing just to tell them, we know your liars. We know you're taking over. We know this
[2:57:56.480 --> 2:58:02.080]  is all a scam. Right. I mean, what's the point? And actually has admitted it. She says the
[2:58:02.080 --> 2:58:07.840]  commitment to local control is lip service. Well, of course it is though. It's all a political
[2:58:07.840 --> 2:58:14.240]  process to stall. We'll just keep going there this segment. I mean, Bob, we can talk about
[2:58:14.240 --> 2:58:19.680]  this local stuff all day long and we have fought them. We have politically exposed them and people
[2:58:19.680 --> 2:58:23.760]  have done a great job, but you can have 1400 people at a meeting stomping, shaking the building,
[2:58:23.760 --> 2:58:28.320]  and they still vote against you. They're still moving forward. The legislature can pass a law
[2:58:28.320 --> 2:58:33.280]  saying that Rick Perry can't toll existing roads and he just overrides it criminally.
[2:58:33.280 --> 2:58:37.440]  He goes to Bilderberg group to meet with indicted members of the Bilderberg group that are involved
[2:58:37.440 --> 2:58:43.520]  grabbing TXU and grabbing roads and infrastructure and the power plants. But if we can convince
[2:58:43.520 --> 2:58:50.800]  the Campo board not to do this, break Texas law basically, find a loophole. That's a small victory.
[2:58:50.800 --> 2:58:56.080]  If we can't convince them to do it, it just exposes the criminality even more and you gotta
[2:58:56.080 --> 2:59:00.880]  fight. Well, I mean, I would bring up all the old lies because we always focus on the new ones.
[2:59:00.880 --> 2:59:04.080]  Why not bring up the fact they swore none of these roads are going to be toll roads to begin with?
[2:59:04.080 --> 2:59:09.200]  Well, yeah, they did that and they also swore that they would never toll the interstates and we
[2:59:09.200 --> 2:59:13.360]  blew the cover on that one last year. I was very proud of that. You know, there are a bunch of
[2:59:13.360 --> 2:59:17.200]  liars and the more people realize it, the more they wake up. We're going to come back to the
[2:59:17.200 --> 2:59:22.080]  better audience in about 10 seconds and plug when the meeting is again, I think people should go
[2:59:22.080 --> 2:59:28.480]  out to it. But just to believe nothing they say because all they do is lie. Here we go.
[2:59:33.280 --> 2:59:38.720]  Okay, we're looking at the local level of what's happening from Indiana to New Jersey.
[2:59:38.720 --> 2:59:43.520]  It's happening in Canada. It's happening in England everywhere. They put transponders in
[2:59:43.520 --> 2:59:48.800]  your cars. They tax you upwards of $6, $7 a mile in some cases. They track everywhere you go with
[2:59:48.800 --> 2:59:53.600]  the transponders. The money goes to offshore corporations. These offshore corporations only
[2:59:53.600 --> 2:59:57.920]  loot. They only come in and get already built or already paid for roads. And then they just
[2:59:57.920 --> 3:00:05.040]  slap toll roads on it coming into Austin off of 183 back from Denver. I know that it says pay cash
[3:00:05.040 --> 3:00:09.760]  here and then 100 yards later makes you get off and says only transponders allowed. So it's also
[3:00:09.760 --> 3:00:15.120]  another big scam and a joke there. They swore none of this was even happening. As the toll roads go
[3:00:15.120 --> 3:00:19.600]  in, they keep saying that those roads don't even exist. I mean, I mean, that's the level of lying
[3:00:19.600 --> 3:00:24.640]  for the sheephole out there. But where is it going? I mean, I know a little bit about this,
[3:00:24.640 --> 3:00:28.480]  but Bob, you're more up to date on it. We are having victories, though, thanks to people in
[3:00:28.480 --> 3:00:33.680]  Texas within claiming they weren't going to toll existing interstate highways and state roads,
[3:00:33.680 --> 3:00:38.960]  but now they had to admit they are planning that. Where is that going? Well, where that's going is,
[3:00:38.960 --> 3:00:44.320]  I don't know. I mean, I heard that Senator Hutchison came out last year and said she was going to
[3:00:44.320 --> 3:00:50.320]  introduce a bill to stop the practice nationwide. And then Bush signed an executive order saying,
[3:00:50.320 --> 3:00:54.640]  federally, we're going to hand the roads over. You know, it's a big crook fist. You know,
[3:00:54.640 --> 3:00:59.200]  and you're right, Alex, you can't trust them as far as you can throw them. But anything we can do,
[3:00:59.200 --> 3:01:03.360]  anything we can do to throw stuff and tax... What is she doing at this co-op meeting?
[3:01:03.360 --> 3:01:08.160]  How are they trying to co-opt everybody? What they're trying to do without public
[3:01:08.160 --> 3:01:14.640]  hearing, they're trying to circumvent the legislative intent of the Texas legislature,
[3:01:14.640 --> 3:01:19.760]  which says that these toll roads have to be commercially viable and they have to pay for
[3:01:19.760 --> 3:01:24.080]  themselves and any money that they make is supposed to stay right there on the toll road.
[3:01:24.080 --> 3:01:27.920]  What they're trying to do is say, well, no, we found out that this particular project is not
[3:01:27.920 --> 3:01:34.400]  commercially viable. Therefore, we don't care. We want to do a waiver so that the bankers will
[3:01:34.400 --> 3:01:41.840]  loan us the money. And I mean, by the way, while we're talking about this, you're not just saying
[3:01:41.840 --> 3:01:46.640]  Austin's the battleground. They have said federally and internationally and at toll road
[3:01:46.640 --> 3:01:52.320]  conferences that Austin is the model and they're learning. They're studying how to buy off politicians.
[3:01:52.320 --> 3:01:56.320]  They're studying how to lie. They're studying how to play all the games. So it is a key battle.
[3:01:56.320 --> 3:02:00.480]  And that's why any listeners that are in the central Texas area need to be at this
[3:02:00.480 --> 3:02:07.440]  Josie Thompson Conference Center at six o'clock tonight on the UT campus and go against this
[3:02:07.440 --> 3:02:13.840]  Camp-O board, item number seven, and tell them, no, don't vote for it. You're circumventing the
[3:02:13.840 --> 3:02:18.240]  legislative intent. And this is the supposed locals that have authority. Yeah, supposedly. And I've
[3:02:18.240 --> 3:02:22.960]  said forever that it's a sham. Now, I know some of the board's new, but last time I checked a bunch
[3:02:22.960 --> 3:02:27.280]  of them wives and husbands work for the toll company. I don't know. I know that Kirk Watson is
[3:02:27.280 --> 3:02:33.440]  the one sitting on top of it. And he is the United Nations global. And he also owns a bank here in
[3:02:33.440 --> 3:02:38.160]  Texas handing over. Yeah, I understand that he's not going to be able to vote because he owns a
[3:02:38.160 --> 3:02:43.600]  bank that has something to do with it. Yeah, well, you know, can you imagine that a conflict of
[3:02:43.600 --> 3:02:47.920]  interest amongst these people? It's like Goldman Sachs openly handing money to itself out of the
[3:02:47.920 --> 3:02:54.320]  ballot. Can you believe that guy's name is cash carry? They take the cash from us and they carried
[3:02:54.320 --> 3:02:58.560]  over to Goldman Sachs and they say, here, you figure out what to do with this money. It's crazy.
[3:02:58.560 --> 3:03:02.080]  But anyway, y'all got to be there if you're in central Texas or I'm going to be ashamed of you.
[3:03:02.080 --> 3:03:06.400]  Just plug it over and over again. Just say it five more times. All right. One or two more times.
[3:03:06.400 --> 3:03:12.560]  Camp-O board meeting tonight, October the 13th, 6 p.m. at the Josie Thompson Conference Center
[3:03:12.560 --> 3:03:18.080]  University of Texas campus, Dean Keaton at Red River Streets. Get over there because they sprung
[3:03:18.080 --> 3:03:22.720]  this on us and they're trying to do no public input. Plug it again. All right. One more time
[3:03:22.720 --> 3:03:27.200]  just because over and over again. Repetition overcomes noise in the communications channel.
[3:03:27.200 --> 3:03:33.840]  I learned that tonight, six o'clock. That's right. Josie Thompson Conference Center,
[3:03:33.840 --> 3:03:38.400]  University of Texas campus, Dean Keaton at Red River. Any of you listening out there,
[3:03:38.400 --> 3:03:42.880]  you got to get over there by six o'clock and tell them no on item seven where they're trying to
[3:03:42.880 --> 3:03:47.200]  circumvent the intent of the legislature. It's just best to let them know you're fully aware
[3:03:47.200 --> 3:03:51.040]  of their operations. And by the way, this is the same sort of financial nonsense which got us in
[3:03:51.040 --> 3:03:55.200]  trouble nationwide. All this ridiculous stuff. They say, well, the economics don't work. Well,
[3:03:55.200 --> 3:04:00.560]  let's just do it anyway. Because the bankers paid us off. We need the cheaper bonds from the New
[3:04:00.560 --> 3:04:05.440]  York bankers. So let's kind everybody in this. That's what happens. The counties and cities
[3:04:05.440 --> 3:04:10.080]  pimped out like like a heroin dealer does an attic, you know, totally strung out. And then
[3:04:10.080 --> 3:04:14.320]  they say, okay, just like the IMF and World Bank does in third world countries, they say, you've
[3:04:14.320 --> 3:04:18.560]  got to do this hundred and something things we say, hand over your water, hand over your roads,
[3:04:18.560 --> 3:04:23.200]  you got to privatize it. And the privatization just means handing it over. It doesn't mean
[3:04:23.200 --> 3:04:27.440]  they're even taking responsibility for it. Okay, I promise your phone calls on the economy and a
[3:04:27.440 --> 3:04:33.920]  lot more with Bob Desi. A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist
[3:04:33.920 --> 3:04:40.640]  act of war against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[3:04:40.640 --> 3:04:45.760]  Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[3:04:45.760 --> 3:04:50.640]  Fabled Enemies is the first 911 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[3:04:50.640 --> 3:04:55.440]  networks inside the United States. Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis
[3:04:55.440 --> 3:05:02.800]  again very much engaged in spying in and on the US. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been
[3:05:02.800 --> 3:05:08.320]  detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian
[3:05:08.320 --> 3:05:12.560]  connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government,
[3:05:12.560 --> 3:05:19.200]  and much, much more fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality,
[3:05:19.200 --> 3:05:25.600]  along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv. Either you are with us or you are with the
[3:05:25.600 --> 3:05:33.600]  terrorists. Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant

[3:06:33.840 --> 3:06:37.120]  length here recently, and she was talking about the Great Depression, and we were talking about
[3:06:37.120 --> 3:06:41.680]  the gas prices, the food prices, this economic uncertainty we're in these, you know, really
[3:06:41.680 --> 3:06:45.280]  kind of perilous times. No one knows where we're headed or where we might end up, and she was
[3:06:45.280 --> 3:06:49.520]  reminded of the Great Depression and how in those days, folks who lived in the country did okay
[3:06:49.520 --> 3:06:53.200]  because they had chicken and eggs and they could grow gardens and can their food, but how difficult
[3:06:53.200 --> 3:06:56.800]  it was for people who lived in urban areas or in the cities because they didn't have the
[3:06:56.800 --> 3:07:00.240]  landscape for gardening or the know-how, they didn't have the chickens and the livestock,
[3:07:00.240 --> 3:07:04.160]  so it's a lot different for them. Well, we know one thing's certain right now. We're headed into
[3:07:04.160 --> 3:07:08.800]  much higher prices on food, and there is a global food shortage. Now, what can you do to prepare?
[3:07:08.800 --> 3:07:13.520]  Do what I did. Sell some toys off in the garage. Go to the J. Michael Stevens, eFoodsDirect.com
[3:07:13.520 --> 3:07:17.600]  company. Get some food and put it away and be safe. Put a little security in your life. You

[3:07:25.040 --> 3:07:40.000]  now. 1-800-409-5633. Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers?
[3:07:40.000 --> 3:07:48.880]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[3:07:49.680 --> 3:07:56.000]  Alex Jones. All right, Bob Desi is in studio with us. Go into your phone calls right now.
[3:07:57.040 --> 3:08:03.680]  Sean in Minnesota, you're on to the air. Welcome. Hey, Alex, how you doing today? Good, sir.
[3:08:04.560 --> 3:08:09.360]  Hi, I just wanted to call you. You asked about what we're doing with the current economy and
[3:08:09.360 --> 3:08:15.360]  stuff and started raising some rabbits. We're going to be raising some chickens, talking to people.
[3:08:16.160 --> 3:08:20.960]  Wait, do you have an animal premises ID and federal tax that isn't the law but they threaten you
[3:08:20.960 --> 3:08:25.840]  is so they can shut down your small farmer ranch? Did you get a special permit from the
[3:08:25.840 --> 3:08:33.200]  government slave? Yeah, you bet I did. Good, good slave. Yeah, we actually moved out of the cities,
[3:08:33.200 --> 3:08:38.400]  moved out into the country. Oh, that sounds like Al-Qaeda. Sounds Al-Qaeda-ish. You planted
[3:08:38.400 --> 3:08:48.560]  some sacred out there, Blannon. Got able firearms? I plead the sith. How dare you, boy? You must hate
[3:08:48.560 --> 3:08:54.960]  the government. I'm getting to be that way. What makes the grass grow, the government? What makes
[3:08:54.960 --> 3:09:02.720]  the water rain, the government? You were trying to figure out what it was that said that we make
[3:09:02.720 --> 3:09:08.080]  money the old fashioned way we earn it. That was Smith Barney. Yeah, Smith Barney. We make money
[3:09:08.080 --> 3:09:15.280]  the old fashioned way we steal. We print it at the Federal Reserve. So hey, I just wanted to thank
[3:09:15.280 --> 3:09:20.080]  you for opening my eyes. It's been about six months now, so that was pretty, pretty quick.
[3:09:21.520 --> 3:09:26.160]  So I thank you. Sean, good to have you listen to the show. Anything else?
[3:09:28.400 --> 3:09:31.680]  I appreciate it. I mean, what's the economy like in Minnesota overall?
[3:09:32.800 --> 3:09:36.240]  You know, Bob, you keep wondering why your phone's ringing is because you don't turn it off.
[3:09:36.240 --> 3:09:41.600]  I know, I don't. You just leave it on and oh, it rang again. Nobody ever calls me Alex. That's the
[3:09:41.600 --> 3:09:45.040]  thing. Well, they just wait a little on the show. I guarantee you, it's people calling. I'm wanting
[3:09:45.040 --> 3:09:48.880]  you to plug stuff on the show. Well, that's not going to happen. Food prices are going up.
[3:09:49.440 --> 3:09:59.680]  Gas is $2.99 right now. But I was looking at the oil price of crude oil. And I remember Lindsey
[3:09:59.680 --> 3:10:05.840]  Williams, you had him on a couple of months ago talking about gas or oil going to $50 a barrel.
[3:10:05.840 --> 3:10:10.160]  Everything he said happened. In fact, get Lindsey Williams back on the show. Write that down. I
[3:10:10.160 --> 3:10:17.040]  know Tray's having a meeting across the street with the guy. I'm glad you mentioned the new weapon
[3:10:17.040 --> 3:10:22.160]  from Taser, the crowd control. I looked at that show. That's my wife, my brother, my brother.
[3:10:22.160 --> 3:10:25.840]  But if anybody dies when they happen to get shocked with it, it has nothing to do with
[3:10:25.840 --> 3:10:31.680]  electricity. Yeah, exactly. It's a new phenomenon. Or the bullets, they can shoot out of the out of
[3:10:31.680 --> 3:10:38.640]  a 12 gauge now too. Effective at 100 yards. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Well, thanks for
[3:10:39.600 --> 3:10:44.240]  what you're doing, Alex, and keep up the good work. Yeah, that's the threat continuum. Oh,
[3:10:44.240 --> 3:10:48.720]  well, one person got out of line at a demonstration. Now we get to shower the whole crowd, including
[3:10:48.720 --> 3:10:55.360]  women with baby strollers and infants with Taser bullets. And don't forget the new preferred
[3:10:55.360 --> 3:10:59.280]  method of suicide, wrapping yourself with duct tape and jumping in the lake. Don't forget that.
[3:10:59.280 --> 3:11:02.800]  And slicing your whole body up. Right. Don't forget that. That's the new preferred. This is
[3:11:02.800 --> 3:11:07.200]  obviously a suicide, right? Here in Austin, here in Austin. I mean, you know, there's some new stuff
[3:11:07.200 --> 3:11:13.200]  going on out there. That's one of them. Everything's fine. Let's talk to Eddie in California. Eddie,
[3:11:13.200 --> 3:11:18.240]  you're on the air. Go ahead. Alex, thank you for taking my call. Thank you for calling, sir. What's
[3:11:18.240 --> 3:11:26.000]  on your mind? Yeah, it's funny guys are talking about these toll roads. I traveled extensively
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:33.680]  throughout China. And then the town that was staying farm town, they actually built a toll road
[3:11:34.320 --> 3:11:40.400]  or between the city where farmers did went to and sold their goods and that town. So,
[3:11:41.120 --> 3:11:46.480]  of course, the farmers didn't like it because because they're with Al-Qaeda. Anybody who doesn't
[3:11:46.480 --> 3:11:50.960]  like what the government's doing is with Al-Qaeda or needs to be Taser. Actually, since I do go
[3:11:50.960 --> 3:11:57.120]  to China, I am a communist. So, you know, we're against the bankers taking over here. I mean,
[3:11:57.120 --> 3:12:00.640]  get the back of yes, I'm a communist. Exactly. Exactly. As a matter of fact,
[3:12:00.640 --> 3:12:05.520]  every time we come back to customs, you always ask me what I was doing in China. Very suspicious.
[3:12:05.520 --> 3:12:07.920]  Well, if you're a communist, that means you're going to vote for Obama, right?
[3:12:09.040 --> 3:12:16.080]  Absolutely. But anyway, like the difference there, because some people are living with
[3:12:16.080 --> 3:12:21.600]  tinnies anyway, you know, I mean, the dollar means that someone's going to eat or not.
[3:12:21.600 --> 3:12:27.200]  And I mean, the toll road literally, I mean, took that away. So, these farmers literally went out
[3:12:27.200 --> 3:12:33.280]  with torches and pitchforks, went to the toll booth where like the police station, a little
[3:12:33.280 --> 3:12:39.360]  police station was set up and all of that and burned it down and had all the police and military
[3:12:39.360 --> 3:12:46.080]  out of there and nothing happened to them. Well, let me break this down. In China, in Beijing,
[3:12:46.080 --> 3:12:50.480]  they put up a few hundred cameras last year and the public just climbed the poles and tore them
[3:12:50.480 --> 3:12:55.600]  down and the cops couldn't do anything. And there are videos all over YouTube shot by camera
[3:12:55.600 --> 3:13:00.880]  phones. We'll show people with pitchforks and hammers and rakes attacking police that are
[3:13:00.880 --> 3:13:05.600]  shooting them with machine guns and the people overrun them, kill them, burn out the police
[3:13:05.600 --> 3:13:11.200]  station and all over China, there's maps online, there are whole cities and towns taken back by
[3:13:11.200 --> 3:13:15.840]  the people and they'll try to have the army march in and they'll basically say no. So, yes, they are
[3:13:15.840 --> 3:13:23.440]  more spirit of 1776 than we are. I'm not saying I mean, yeah, because that's right, but I'm seeing
[3:13:23.440 --> 3:13:28.720]  too. I mean, what I don't understand is how the bankers are going to bankrupt us, take away the
[3:13:28.720 --> 3:13:33.760]  middle class and expect us not to start paying attention. Well, we're trained to grovel to the
[3:13:33.760 --> 3:13:37.600]  government. The Chinese have always rebelled. That's why Mao and the CIA funding, they tricked
[3:13:37.600 --> 3:13:42.720]  them into getting behind, kicking out Sheng Ka-shek, which our government did, while telling the
[3:13:42.720 --> 3:13:48.800]  public we were for Sheng Ka-shek and the Nationalists. Here, I have to tell you, we are domesticated.
[3:13:48.800 --> 3:13:52.320]  We got something more important than that though. See, that's a deal. We got football.
[3:13:52.320 --> 3:13:56.880]  Yeah. I mean, Texas beat OU, so everything's all right. Oh, you may be going into depression.
[3:13:56.880 --> 3:14:00.880]  Did you hear it was on the, it was even on the local news. Hundreds of cars, they would wave
[3:14:00.880 --> 3:14:06.560]  them into parking lots and tell them free parking and then tow them all. See, everything's going
[3:14:06.560 --> 3:14:10.800]  corrupt. But you know, that's what I'm saying. I mean, you know, the Chinese don't have football,
[3:14:10.800 --> 3:14:16.720]  so they got nothing, they got nothing to distract their, their... Yeah, so what? We'll probably
[3:14:16.720 --> 3:14:21.360]  all be homeless and have no future. They're building famous camps, but then cowboys, now they lost.
[3:14:21.360 --> 3:14:26.000]  Boy, they screwed up, Benny. Well, I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what, boy. I don't know what I'm
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:32.080]  going to do today. Yeah, but my, my long horn... My manliness ain't feeling too good right now.
[3:14:32.080 --> 3:14:36.000]  My long horn's won and I like that. I hate you as many as I can.
[3:14:36.000 --> 3:14:41.680]  Yeah, boy. Hey, just because you're fighting the new world order doesn't mean you can't
[3:14:41.680 --> 3:14:44.560]  watch football down there once in a while. All right, all right, listen, listen. Eddie,
[3:14:44.560 --> 3:14:48.880]  I appreciate your call. Take care. Jimmy in Arkansas. Jimmy, you're on the air.
[3:14:48.880 --> 3:14:56.560]  Hello, Mr. Jones. I want to touch on that, this martial law... Hey, hold on a second,
[3:14:56.560 --> 3:15:01.680]  Dacey. What? You're going to... No, I've never... You know, that went over... Dacey, control yourself.
[3:15:01.680 --> 3:15:05.520]  I didn't say that on air. Yeah, you did. Anyways, look, this is out of control. You know what?
[3:15:05.520 --> 3:15:10.400]  I screw around with you and I get in a joking mood. Let's get serious here. Serious, serious time.
[3:15:10.400 --> 3:15:15.280]  Sorry, caller. Go ahead, Jimmy. Jimmy, I just want to touch on this martial law business
[3:15:15.280 --> 3:15:20.720]  that... I'll be honest with you. I've got a lot of friends that are in the military and I'm a vet
[3:15:20.720 --> 3:15:30.720]  myself and I think in the long run, it's not going to work. On the simple fact, I've talked to a few
[3:15:30.720 --> 3:15:35.520]  of them that are still in the military and I brought up the point to them and, you know,
[3:15:35.520 --> 3:15:39.840]  there's a schedule going on in the military about this martial law. Some of them, you know, are
[3:15:39.840 --> 3:15:46.400]  over here, you know, getting trained for it. But anyway, I've asked them a question that,
[3:15:47.040 --> 3:15:52.560]  okay, if they hear the touch and they send you off over to, say, Oakland, California,
[3:15:53.120 --> 3:15:56.880]  and you're hurting all these people around and putting them in FEMA camps and all this kind of
[3:15:56.880 --> 3:16:04.560]  thing, what's to say that there's not another bunch out of Kentucky back in your hometown
[3:16:04.560 --> 3:16:09.360]  doing the same thing to your mom, dad, brothers, sisters, whatever that you're doing, people out
[3:16:09.360 --> 3:16:14.800]  there in California. No, that's it. And the Soviet Union, the Nazis, that's how it's all done and
[3:16:14.800 --> 3:16:19.520]  they actually have public plans to do that. And they signed a deal this year. They really
[3:16:19.520 --> 3:16:23.120]  signed it seven years ago, but they made it public earlier this year. It was in the news
[3:16:23.120 --> 3:16:27.200]  without Congress. Congress said, we weren't involved in that. Why weren't we notified? You
[3:16:27.200 --> 3:16:31.200]  know, that's our authority. Used to the Congress had to even commission an officer. You know,
[3:16:31.200 --> 3:16:34.960]  the executive couldn't even pick the officers because an executive might try to set up martial
[3:16:34.960 --> 3:16:40.880]  law by putting his officers in. So separation of powers, Congress had to do that. Well, here was
[3:16:40.880 --> 3:16:46.240]  the Canadian, Mexican and U.S. generals signing a North American Union pact to fight terrorists
[3:16:46.240 --> 3:16:52.000]  and for civil unrest. But here's the problem. We're not just going to send people out of Kentucky
[3:16:52.000 --> 3:16:57.760]  into Northern California or people from Texas into Minnesota or vice versa from Florida to,
[3:16:57.760 --> 3:17:03.200]  you know, to, you know, to Georgia or whatever. They're not just going to do that. What they're
[3:17:03.200 --> 3:17:07.680]  doing is they are going to create an economic implosion where through hyperinflation they're
[3:17:07.680 --> 3:17:11.680]  not going to increase the size of the welfare check or the social security check. People aren't
[3:17:11.680 --> 3:17:15.920]  going to have jobs on top of it. And so even if they still get the checks, they won't be able to
[3:17:15.920 --> 3:17:22.320]  buy what they need. So the rioting will start and we'll see news images of scum stealing TVs,
[3:17:22.320 --> 3:17:27.600]  shooting firemen as they've been caught doing before. And then it will be legitimized and the
[3:17:27.600 --> 3:17:31.680]  troops will say, well, things are breaking down. We've got to do it. We saw that in New Orleans.
[3:17:31.680 --> 3:17:36.400]  So see, this is going to be done psychologically where the military is going to be seduced into
[3:17:36.400 --> 3:17:45.280]  going along with it. What's your take on that from Arkansas, Jimmy? Well, I think that might work
[3:17:45.280 --> 3:17:52.000]  to a point that you're still, you're still going to have this problem of this out now, you know,
[3:17:52.640 --> 3:17:55.680]  one American turning on another one, irregardless, you know,
[3:17:55.680 --> 3:18:01.680]  the military, you're common. Okay, they've been called every derogatory name in the book over
[3:18:01.680 --> 3:18:07.840]  the years, dog faces, everything else. When it comes down to it, your average ground pounder,
[3:18:08.480 --> 3:18:13.760]  they're not stupid by any stretch of the imagination. And they're going to be able to
[3:18:13.760 --> 3:18:19.120]  figure out that somebody somewhere down the line has gave an illegal order.
[3:18:19.120 --> 3:18:26.000]  And under the uniform code of military justice, you are not obligated to follow a military,
[3:18:26.000 --> 3:18:29.680]  you know, an illegal order. Well, let me ask you this question. Let me ask you this question.
[3:18:29.680 --> 3:18:32.640]  And again, I'm not playing devil's advocate. I'm saying how they're going to sell it,
[3:18:32.640 --> 3:18:41.600]  how they are selling it to the public. And I don't think that they'll ever be able to overcome
[3:18:41.600 --> 3:18:48.560]  them is just, just you're out and out conscience and trying to fit one American against another
[3:18:48.560 --> 3:18:54.560]  American, just, just to be fit and against it. That'll work for a while, you know,
[3:18:54.560 --> 3:18:59.680]  because you're going to have a honeymoon period where it's all new and exciting and yada yada.
[3:18:59.680 --> 3:19:06.400]  But after a while, it's going to start where, you know, where, where and on. And no, I hear
[3:19:06.400 --> 3:19:10.960]  you, but, but I'm going to skip this break for prisonplanet.tv subscribers watching on
[3:19:10.960 --> 3:19:15.680]  prisonplanet.tv and people listening on the info wars exclusive streams. Everybody else
[3:19:15.680 --> 3:19:21.520]  will be back in four minutes. Stay there because Jimmy, I'm going to continue having this talk
[3:19:21.520 --> 3:19:26.400]  with him. We'll come back, go to Matthew, David, Ahmed, Ryan and others. We're already under
[3:19:26.400 --> 3:19:32.560]  martial law. We're talking about hot martial law. Okay, we're going to go ahead and skip that
[3:19:32.560 --> 3:19:38.480]  break. John, thank you. My point is what they're going to do is, Jimmy, and the military needs
[3:19:38.480 --> 3:19:46.240]  to know this now. They are going to stage strategic televised killings of troops trying to get food
[3:19:46.240 --> 3:19:51.520]  to rioting people. There are also regular scum out there who every time there's riots who shoot
[3:19:51.520 --> 3:19:57.120]  the firemen in police, you're going to have them as well. And so those incidents, just like in
[3:19:57.120 --> 3:20:02.320]  Seattle, they had all the riot police, the Delta Force and the feds hired 50 thugs through a
[3:20:02.320 --> 3:20:06.000]  foundation. They let them attack police. A little of the cops didn't know what was happening. They
[3:20:06.000 --> 3:20:10.240]  pointed out, though, that they weren't allowed to arrest them. Then the 50 anarchists retired to a
[3:20:10.240 --> 3:20:14.720]  government paid for building under police guard. And the national news said, look, now the anarchists
[3:20:14.720 --> 3:20:18.560]  are going to be attacked by the police. You know, they waited a day. Well, the public said,
[3:20:18.560 --> 3:20:21.280]  somebody's got to do something here. Somebody's got to stand for these anarchists breaking out
[3:20:21.280 --> 3:20:28.240]  windows and attacking cops and doing all of this. And so then the cops returned loose on the peaceful
[3:20:28.240 --> 3:20:33.600]  60,000 people, beat old ladies with clubs, attacked them, went into neighborhoods, went into businesses.
[3:20:33.600 --> 3:20:40.160]  So it's the psychology. They're going to stage attacks on troops in the first stages of physical
[3:20:40.160 --> 3:20:45.600]  hot martial law, not judicial or legislative or executive martial law through the courts,
[3:20:45.600 --> 3:20:50.000]  through corruption, you know, this incremental, but real martial law, they're going to stage
[3:20:50.000 --> 3:20:55.040]  events to psychologically get the military behind all of this. So how do you respond to that?
[3:20:56.320 --> 3:21:00.000]  Well, you got a good point there and good valid point. But
[3:21:00.000 --> 3:21:05.120]  in this day and age, okay, you stop and think about this, this has been brought up repeatedly,
[3:21:05.120 --> 3:21:10.240]  all these cameras running around. Let's go back to that deal with you and this Michelle Malcolm.
[3:21:11.600 --> 3:21:17.440]  They sat there and they said, you did this, that, and yada, yada, yada. And you didn't do that. And
[3:21:17.440 --> 3:21:23.840]  everybody in their dog anymore has some sort of video device, whether it be their cell phone or
[3:21:23.840 --> 3:21:31.280]  their cell phone or their Kodak digital camera, whatever. Somebody is going to get a picture
[3:21:31.280 --> 3:21:35.520]  of something somewhere. You know what, I agree with you. And that's the answer. We just had to,
[3:21:35.520 --> 3:21:39.920]  we have to, we have to war game the sound, tell you, you know, like we're gaming a chess game,
[3:21:39.920 --> 3:21:44.080]  what their moves are going to be in this war game. So we know how they're going to run the
[3:21:44.080 --> 3:21:48.960]  psychological warfare operation on the public, the military, the police and everybody. And I agree
[3:21:48.960 --> 3:21:52.960]  with you, just like in Montobello earlier this year, when we caught them and ended up coming
[3:21:52.960 --> 3:21:57.600]  up on national news, the patriot movement caught police dressed like anarchists, attacking cops,
[3:21:57.600 --> 3:22:01.520]  staging their arrest, them being released, and the police had to admit they staged it.
[3:22:01.520 --> 3:22:06.320]  In Seattle, we exposed it was staged in other parts of the world. And so now people know and
[3:22:06.320 --> 3:22:10.880]  are looking for that. And you're right that in Minnesota, they caught the cops staging some
[3:22:10.880 --> 3:22:16.560]  stuff. So you're right that the cat is out of the bag. So, so I agree with you. Last question for
[3:22:16.560 --> 3:22:20.240]  you, unless Bob has any for you, Jimmy, for Marcus, I just wanted to say that that's what
[3:22:20.240 --> 3:22:24.400]  the info war is all about, isn't it, Alex? That's what you're, that's why you're sitting there.
[3:22:24.400 --> 3:22:29.360]  Well, the main war is getting people to know history and know how these controllers operate,
[3:22:29.360 --> 3:22:33.120]  so that we're not telling people what to think. We're teaching people how to open their eyes up
[3:22:33.120 --> 3:22:37.760]  and analyze things for themselves, because a lot of day we'll bring this new order down.
[3:22:37.760 --> 3:22:41.760]  But finishing up, Jimmy, you say scuttlebutt. I mean, they admit they're training the military,
[3:22:41.760 --> 3:22:46.560]  they're training the police for urban warfare, for domestic suppression of the population. You
[3:22:46.560 --> 3:22:52.000]  say you talk to people in the military, let's say yes, it's going on. What do they think when
[3:22:52.000 --> 3:22:56.160]  they read the Boston Globe saying it isn't going on? I mean, doesn't that add to this that the media
[3:22:56.160 --> 3:23:01.600]  is lying about it? Yeah, they don't have a whole lot of faith in mainstream media at all, because,
[3:23:01.600 --> 3:23:08.400]  you know, they, okay, I've got a son in Iraq, somewhere over there. I worry about him every day.
[3:23:08.400 --> 3:23:17.920]  And it makes me sick on a simple fact. He's over there in Iraq, under the same guys that I was
[3:23:17.920 --> 3:23:23.520]  over in Vietnam, you know, in a sex. You know, there ain't no other way to put it. Sorry about
[3:23:23.520 --> 3:23:30.560]  using that phrase on your radio, but anyway. Hold on, we're coming back to the full audience.
[3:23:30.560 --> 3:23:43.360]  I repeat that and expand on there. Here we go. We were just talking to Jimmy in Arkansas. He was
[3:23:43.360 --> 3:23:48.320]  in Vietnam, his sons in Iraq, and he was saying what he doesn't like is, is that the same criminal
[3:23:48.320 --> 3:23:54.000]  syndicate that was over him in Vietnam is over his son. And you know, that's the paradox here,
[3:23:54.000 --> 3:23:58.160]  the courage of the men and women in uniform, the hell they go through and what do they get?
[3:23:58.160 --> 3:24:02.400]  They get their medical treatment cut. The vets are having their treatment cut that was promised
[3:24:02.400 --> 3:24:06.480]  to them. They're shot up with all these experimental vaccines. Finish up your point, Jimmy.
[3:24:07.600 --> 3:24:13.200]  Now, anyway, the military doesn't really buy in the mainstream media, you know, they'll set there,
[3:24:13.200 --> 3:24:18.480]  and like you said earlier, that, you know, they'll deny that, oh, there's not any
[3:24:19.920 --> 3:24:24.720]  real urban training going on here, there, anywhere else. But when it was actually
[3:24:24.720 --> 3:24:34.560]  caught on somebody's private video device, and they put it on YouTube or Google or whatever,
[3:24:35.120 --> 3:24:40.800]  or put it in a blog on their personal website for the whole world to see, you know, it kind of
[3:24:40.800 --> 3:24:45.600]  throws a, throws a lot of egg in mainstream media space. Now, I'm not going to sit here and say
[3:24:45.600 --> 3:24:50.720]  that the mainstream media, everything that they say is a lie because, you know, it's not, there's
[3:24:50.720 --> 3:24:55.760]  some stuff to tell you, you know, they're accurate, but they're really, really good at deception.
[3:24:56.560 --> 3:25:00.400]  Well, I mean, obviously, most of what they say is true so that they can then trick you with a
[3:25:00.400 --> 3:25:06.800]  little bit of disinfo on key subjects they put out. Yeah, you know, you tell a whole lot of
[3:25:06.800 --> 3:25:12.240]  truths and throw in a couple of three, you know, lies, you know, it's, it's kind of hard to sort
[3:25:12.240 --> 3:25:19.920]  out what's back and what's fixed. Yeah, it creates a haze of not knowing. Well, I'll say that, you
[3:25:19.920 --> 3:25:25.520]  know, in their defense of the mainstream media, they are very, very good at sports scores and
[3:25:25.520 --> 3:25:28.640]  are not too bad at weather. Well, see, they're not lying about those things. That's right. But
[3:25:28.640 --> 3:25:32.560]  here's the deal. I would go, they spin everything else. That's the problem. It's not even lying
[3:25:32.560 --> 3:25:36.480]  most of the time. It's spinning or it's lying by a mission. I mean, I mean, here's the thing.
[3:25:36.480 --> 3:25:40.640]  I'd go to an urban warfare drill in, in Temple or an urban warfare drill in California, an urban
[3:25:40.640 --> 3:25:45.200]  warfare drill somewhere else, and I would witness the troops training for America on video saying,
[3:25:45.200 --> 3:25:48.160]  where are you from? I'm from San Francisco. Where'd you get the gun? Where'd you get the,
[3:25:48.160 --> 3:25:52.320]  and then I'd see Marines doing real checkpoints with police helping them arrest people. And then
[3:25:52.320 --> 3:25:57.360]  I'd come back and then I'd be at the event and I'd see CNN there and I'd watch the CNN report
[3:25:57.360 --> 3:26:03.440]  and they'd say, the Marines were doing urban warfare drills for Central Asia in the future and,
[3:26:03.440 --> 3:26:09.280]  of course, for Macedonia. And in a way, it's true because it's dual use training, but it, but it
[3:26:09.280 --> 3:26:13.840]  was the main function was for the United States. So see, that's, that's, that's how you know they're
[3:26:13.840 --> 3:26:18.880]  lying because we just showed people the video of what the Marines were actually saying. Same thing,
[3:26:18.880 --> 3:26:23.200]  same thing happened here in Austin today in the local paper that, that Campo thing I'm talking
[3:26:23.200 --> 3:26:28.080]  about. They discussed it, but they brought up some other non-issue and they left alone the big one.
[3:26:28.080 --> 3:26:32.640]  They, they lie by omission. Yeah, they'll talk about all the Campo board is meeting to discuss
[3:26:33.280 --> 3:26:37.840]  the future of this little side issue and then ever discuss it's about tolling roads they swore
[3:26:37.840 --> 3:26:42.240]  they wouldn't toll. Right. They lie by omission. They bring up something minor. They won't cover the
[3:26:42.240 --> 3:26:47.200]  stuff that matters. And therefore, hey, you keep sucking up the mainstream media. You keep getting
[3:26:47.200 --> 3:26:52.640]  fed garbage. Hey, listen, anything else you want to add, Jimmy? Uh, yeah, I would. It's a little
[3:26:52.640 --> 3:26:58.400]  off the subject, but this is just mainly for the listeners, but you know, okay, I'm disabled. There's
[3:26:58.400 --> 3:27:03.360]  not a whole lot I can do in the movement with what little I do do. I make a lot of DVDs for God's
[3:27:03.360 --> 3:27:09.760]  sake, do that and pass them out. And also you can get on the internet, bookstore, or wherever,
[3:27:09.760 --> 3:27:14.000]  and you get these little pocket copies of the Constitution of the United States.
[3:27:14.640 --> 3:27:19.760]  Buy as many of them as you can and pass them out freely and get people to understand that that is
[3:27:19.760 --> 3:27:26.560]  what they're. We didn't hang up on you, sir. Well, he's back. Okay, go ahead.
[3:27:28.560 --> 3:27:31.840]  No, I, oh, yeah, Jimmy, your phone cut out for a minute. You're still there.
[3:27:32.480 --> 3:27:38.000]  Oh, well, I was just saying, everybody, if they just pass out there, pass out the DVDs like
[3:27:38.000 --> 3:27:46.720]  loose change and things like that in game and get a pocket, a little pocket copies of the Constitution
[3:27:46.720 --> 3:27:51.920]  and pass those out freely and get people to understand that the Constitution still has clout.
[3:27:51.920 --> 3:27:59.040]  It has nothing to do with that Patriot Act was just a bunch of garbage. The word will get out,
[3:27:59.040 --> 3:28:03.520]  and hopefully I've changed a lot of minds myself. Like I said, I'm disabled. I can't do a whole lot,
[3:28:03.520 --> 3:28:07.200]  but I do everything that I can. Jimmy, we got to run, but great point. Let me just add,
[3:28:07.200 --> 3:28:09.600]  and we're going to go to break and come back and try to hurry through calls a little bit faster.
[3:28:09.600 --> 3:28:13.680]  He just had a lot of interesting things to say. Matthew, David, Ahmed, Ryan and others,
[3:28:13.680 --> 3:28:17.920]  and Bob Dacey's take on what's happening. We'll also plug his TV show and articles he writes before
[3:28:17.920 --> 3:28:22.560]  he leaves us. It's this, people say, what's the solution, Alex? We want a silver bullet. We want
[3:28:22.560 --> 3:28:29.200]  a magic thing that we can do that will change everything overnight. Okay, look in the mirror
[3:28:29.200 --> 3:28:33.040]  and realize you're the solution to the problem and get up off your butt and don't imagine some
[3:28:33.040 --> 3:28:37.760]  perfect solution. Little things together move mountains. Many hands make light work,
[3:28:37.760 --> 3:28:41.680]  and the public is finally listening. They're finally realizing they've been lied to.
[3:28:41.680 --> 3:28:46.320]  And so now the people are more receptive to the truth than ever. And so a lot of you that
[3:28:46.320 --> 3:28:50.080]  looked people up 10, 20 years ago, but quit because some folks weren't listening,
[3:28:50.080 --> 3:28:55.840]  redouble your efforts now. Get Terror Storm in-game. My films, make copies of them. Every video and
[3:28:55.840 --> 3:29:01.120]  book order we have at infowars.com. You get a free pocket constitution. We have them at cost,

[3:29:04.640 --> 3:29:08.800]  Declaration of Independence, powerful stuff in there for those that still read.
[3:29:08.800 --> 3:29:12.640]  But bottom line, the will to fight, the will to think, the will to resist,
[3:29:12.640 --> 3:29:16.960]  this enemy's very unpopular. If we just stand up, they will fall. If not, they're going to win,
[3:29:16.960 --> 3:29:18.640]  and that's going to be hell on earth. We'll be right back.

[3:30:32.640 --> 3:30:38.560]  history, a terrorist act of war against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[3:30:39.200 --> 3:30:44.320]  But who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to
[3:30:44.320 --> 3:30:49.680]  look to Osama bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist
[3:30:49.680 --> 3:30:54.880]  ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some US investigators believe that there
[3:30:54.880 --> 3:31:01.760]  are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US. I'm aware that some Israeli
[3:31:01.760 --> 3:31:07.440]  citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI,
[3:31:07.440 --> 3:31:11.680]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games,
[3:31:11.680 --> 3:31:17.440]  the shadow government and much, much more fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com,

[3:32:39.680 --> 3:32:45.680]  Bob, I just wanted to briefly get your take on taking action. Going back,
[3:32:47.680 --> 3:32:53.520]  just a few, what's going on? Well, no, I wanted to, I just wanted to expand on what the
[3:32:53.520 --> 3:32:57.840]  caller just said about knowing your constitution and how important it is. Well, you know,
[3:32:57.840 --> 3:33:01.120]  if you don't know what your rights are, how can you defend them, right? That's basic.
[3:33:01.120 --> 3:33:04.960]  But your classic example- And the government can't say those rights are gone. If it does that,
[3:33:04.960 --> 3:33:09.200]  it's criminal, it's engaged in terror. And when people could see it, here's a classic example.
[3:33:09.200 --> 3:33:14.320]  Now, people that don't like the constitution are going to think I'm all wet. But if you go read
[3:33:14.320 --> 3:33:18.880]  Article 1, Section 7, for example, which most people don't know what that is, it says very
[3:33:18.880 --> 3:33:24.640]  plainly that when it comes to generating revenue, only the House of Representatives can generate
[3:33:24.640 --> 3:33:29.280]  a revenue bill. That's what it says. It's very simple to read. It says only the House of Representatives
[3:33:29.280 --> 3:33:34.240]  can generate a revenue bill. Now, the Senate can tack onto it, but the House has to generate it.
[3:33:34.240 --> 3:33:38.240]  Well, what happened in the bailout? The House rejected it. There was nothing for the Senate
[3:33:38.240 --> 3:33:43.200]  to discuss. But what they do, they take the bill over to the Senate, they load pork all over it,
[3:33:43.200 --> 3:33:49.840]  another $150 billion worth of revenue generation stuff, and then they send it back to the House,
[3:33:49.840 --> 3:33:52.000]  and then- And it was a bill that didn't pass the House.
[3:33:52.000 --> 3:33:54.720]  That didn't pass the House. It was illegal. Right. So the Senate-
[3:33:54.720 --> 3:33:56.880]  For martial law. What I'm saying is the Senate-
[3:33:56.880 --> 3:33:59.600]  Martial law is when the regular rules and laws are suspended.
[3:33:59.600 --> 3:34:05.200]  The Senate generated revenue bills. That's what the $150 billion worth of extra pork was,
[3:34:05.200 --> 3:34:09.440]  generated in the Senate. If you read the Constitution, you'll know that it's totally
[3:34:09.440 --> 3:34:12.560]  illegal. And that's what we're talking about. You need to know what your rights are in order
[3:34:12.560 --> 3:34:15.600]  to defend them. Okay, let me go back to my other question. I thought you were pointing at something
[3:34:15.600 --> 3:34:18.240]  across the room. You were pointing over there, and I was like, what is it? Is there like a
[3:34:18.240 --> 3:34:24.560]  bug going up the wall or something? Solutions. If all of us individually get involved and do
[3:34:24.560 --> 3:34:30.080]  little things, i.e. the most important, you have to wake the public up first to the new world order,
[3:34:30.080 --> 3:34:34.480]  then they can make real decisions and understand the real price to be paid and the enemy we're up
[3:34:34.480 --> 3:34:38.880]  against. But if they still think the two parties matter and still believe any part of this paradigm,
[3:34:38.880 --> 3:34:43.280]  you know, the public now doesn't trust the media or trust the mainstream media or the government,
[3:34:43.280 --> 3:34:48.160]  but they don't have any idea just how bad it is. Bob, tell briefly, and I'm going to call
[3:34:48.160 --> 3:34:53.120]  your story, how you woke up and what you've been able to do. Well, you know, what I've been able
[3:34:53.120 --> 3:34:57.280]  to do, gosh, I want me to brag on myself. Okay, Google Bob Dacey on the internet and you'll find
[3:34:57.280 --> 3:34:59.760]  out what I've been able to do. Let me give you an example of what one person waking up and taking
[3:34:59.760 --> 3:35:04.640]  action. Okay, you know, years ago, I, I was a conservative Republican type and I was a good
[3:35:04.640 --> 3:35:08.960]  boy. I was, I was a soccer coach and everything, state champions the whole nine yards, you know,
[3:35:08.960 --> 3:35:13.200]  I was literally minding my own business and I knew something was right, just to know what it was. I
[3:35:13.200 --> 3:35:18.400]  just didn't know what it was. And then one day I, I was sitting at home and I, I was watching cable
[3:35:18.400 --> 3:35:24.480]  access TV for some strange reason and up pops this nut, nutcase, punk, some punk, about 23,
[3:35:24.480 --> 3:35:28.720]  24 years, 24 years old, named Alex Jones. I didn't know who the heck he was. He was sitting
[3:35:28.720 --> 3:35:33.040]  or ranting and raving about the United Nations taking over the national park system. And I was
[3:35:33.040 --> 3:35:38.320]  like, this guy's a nut, but I love his delivery style. So I'm going to listen to him. So I listened
[3:35:38.320 --> 3:35:42.160]  to him and I thought, okay, this guy's a, you know, this guy's, you know, he needs to be taken off
[3:35:42.160 --> 3:35:46.640]  to the bunny farm. And then, then he changed the subject. He started talking about second amendment
[3:35:46.640 --> 3:35:52.400]  and I said, Oh, I got to hear this. I got to hear this guy. And so then this Alex Jones character
[3:35:52.400 --> 3:35:58.560]  started to succinctly, precisely, accurately, historically describe the, the purpose, the
[3:35:58.560 --> 3:36:03.280]  history of everything in the second amendment perfectly. And I was going, okay, wait a minute.
[3:36:04.320 --> 3:36:08.720]  This, this, this set up cognitive dissonance in my feeble brain and I'm going, how could he be
[3:36:08.720 --> 3:36:13.920]  an idiot about this UN thing taking over the national parks and be so 100% right on the
[3:36:13.920 --> 3:36:19.840]  second amendment. So I got off of my chair, went to my computer and started researching what he,
[3:36:19.840 --> 3:36:24.400]  what you Alex Jones said about the United Nations biodiversity treaty.
[3:36:24.400 --> 3:36:29.520]  And you found out Congress had tried to block it that the legislature, right? I found out that
[3:36:29.520 --> 3:36:34.240]  the Kentucky state legislature had passed a resolution of previous year explaining it,
[3:36:34.240 --> 3:36:38.240]  condemning it, saying that there was two of these areas in Kentucky that, that the UN was trying
[3:36:38.240 --> 3:36:43.040]  to take over and they didn't want foreign minions in control of Kentucky land. And this was a land,
[3:36:43.040 --> 3:36:47.280]  this was a earth shattering event for me because I was staring at my computer screen. I was saying,
[3:36:47.280 --> 3:36:52.800]  everything that nut told me about was right. And I'm mad because I didn't know about it.
[3:36:52.800 --> 3:36:59.120]  I keep up. I read the papers. I follow current events. And so this opened that little crack of
[3:36:59.120 --> 3:37:03.680]  light into my, into my brain. And then all of a sudden everything started to grow. And by the
[3:37:03.680 --> 3:37:09.120]  time I actually met you, it was so funny, your, your guy that ran your audio board for you at KJFK
[3:37:09.120 --> 3:37:13.040]  on Saturdays worked for me, turned out. I was saying, who's this Alex Jones?
[3:37:13.040 --> 3:37:15.280]  This KJFK was like 200 yards from your hardware.
[3:37:15.280 --> 3:37:18.960]  Yeah. It's just right down the street. And I was like, do you know this Alex Jones guy?
[3:37:18.960 --> 3:37:22.480]  And he says, yeah. And I said, why do you know? Well, I run the audio board for a Saturday show
[3:37:22.480 --> 3:37:27.520]  on KJFK. I said, you got to be kidding. And he said, no. I said, well, this is a guy for real.
[3:37:27.520 --> 3:37:32.640]  And he said, well, he thinks he is, you know, and so I said, bring him in here. I want to meet him.
[3:37:32.640 --> 3:37:37.840]  And so a few days later, he came in there with you in tow into my store and we went back into
[3:37:37.840 --> 3:37:41.040]  my office. I wasn't going to sell you on a sponsorship. Yeah. I don't know what you were
[3:37:41.040 --> 3:37:45.040]  trying to do, but you, that didn't happen at that time. We didn't even talk about a sponsorship.
[3:37:45.040 --> 3:37:50.400]  I'd been doing research myself at that time. And I found out that in my son's senior level
[3:37:50.400 --> 3:37:54.640]  high school government book, they were teaching them that the second amendment doesn't exist,
[3:37:54.640 --> 3:37:59.760]  that it doesn't mean what it says. And I showed that to you and you said, you might have a boy
[3:37:59.760 --> 3:38:05.600]  of this, you know, I said, you're going right ahead. And then the next day you were on the radio
[3:38:05.600 --> 3:38:12.160]  with it, reading it and blasting it and correcting it. And I was thinking, no, it said contrary to
[3:38:12.160 --> 3:38:16.880]  popular belief. The second amendment is only for an armed government militia, the National Guard
[3:38:16.880 --> 3:38:20.800]  and Army. No one is allowed to own guns. And then I went on there and pointed out, well,
[3:38:20.800 --> 3:38:26.160]  we didn't get the National Guard till 1906. Absolutely. So my point is that when you did that,
[3:38:26.160 --> 3:38:29.920]  and I was listening to your radio show at the time, a little, another little light came into
[3:38:29.920 --> 3:38:36.800]  my dense brain that said media power. Wow. This is interesting. I find out something. I give it
[3:38:36.800 --> 3:38:42.240]  to Alex Jones. Boom. It goes all over the city. And now here it is 10 years later, it's going on
[3:38:42.240 --> 3:38:46.640]  over the world. Well, from that station went from Dallas all the way to San Antonio. So it was,
[3:38:46.640 --> 3:38:51.280]  you know, I was like, hey, this is pretty cool. So, you know, you and I have had this very good
[3:38:51.280 --> 3:38:55.200]  relationship over the last 10 years. Then you went and got an access show. Yeah. The next year,
[3:38:55.200 --> 3:39:00.640]  I stumbled into an access show. It's called The Simple Truth. And, you know, we just finished
[3:39:00.640 --> 3:39:04.000]  our ninth year and we're trying to get back on the air again for our 10th year. We're having,
[3:39:04.000 --> 3:39:08.880]  you know, paperwork problems. Well, we'll be back. Historically, it's been six o'clock here on
[3:39:09.600 --> 3:39:14.640]  Channel 10, you know, on Time Warner Cable. And we've also got a website now. And then you started
[3:39:14.640 --> 3:39:18.720]  writing for The New American, which was millions. Yeah. I wrote a couple of articles for The New
[3:39:18.720 --> 3:39:25.440]  American and my producer of my show, Kelly Taylor, she is the official writer for The New American
[3:39:25.440 --> 3:39:30.800]  on the Trans-Texas Court and after Superhighway Issue. Several articles out. And so, you know,
[3:39:30.800 --> 3:39:36.560]  we have, we've done, last year, we were the ones that blew the cover off TextDOT's scheme to
[3:39:36.560 --> 3:39:41.760]  toll the interstates. I mean, that was us. And when, and again, we're now close to defeating
[3:39:41.760 --> 3:39:46.400]  that because you took action to ferret it out. So, there you go, folks, pick your issue, fight
[3:39:46.400 --> 3:39:51.680]  the new world order. You can take action. Let's go to, let's go quick here. Who's up next? I've
[3:39:51.680 --> 3:39:56.880]  got to move fast now. Matthew in New York, you're on the air. I got a call from Costa Rica and I
[3:39:56.880 --> 3:40:01.840]  didn't go to it. Ryan, call back in. I'll go to you. But yeah, go ahead. Alex, hey, it's Matthew.
[3:40:01.840 --> 3:40:07.120]  Hey, buddy. Hey, Bob. Hey, Bob. I never would have guessed you were a good old boy, you know,
[3:40:07.120 --> 3:40:13.280]  based upon your long horn affinity, huh? Go, go, go, Mask the Tribe. You can be, you, look. When
[3:40:13.280 --> 3:40:18.560]  I was a kid, I grew up in the shadow of that tower. Okay. I lived and breathed UT football.
[3:40:18.560 --> 3:40:23.520]  That's all I cared about when I was a kid. That tribal thing gets in you. When I went to UT,
[3:40:23.520 --> 3:40:27.240]  I went there for four years and when I was there, we never beat those sorry oaky sons
[3:40:27.240 --> 3:40:28.240]  of a guns.
[3:40:28.240 --> 3:40:32.660]  And so it gets, you get it in your system and then all of a sudden when the game is
[3:40:32.660 --> 3:40:36.920]  on that tribal thing comes back and all of a sudden I hate the oaky's.
[3:40:36.920 --> 3:40:38.040]  Just for a little while.
[3:40:38.040 --> 3:40:39.040]  Just for a little while.
[3:40:39.040 --> 3:40:41.720]  Let's get off the tribal brand washing here.
[3:40:41.720 --> 3:40:42.720]  It's okay.
[3:40:42.720 --> 3:40:43.720]  45, 35.
[3:40:43.720 --> 3:40:45.040]  Let me ask you a quick question here.
[3:40:45.040 --> 3:40:46.360]  You know, I'm not a conspiracy theory.
[3:40:46.360 --> 3:40:51.160]  I get all the information from their white papers and the primary source material just
[3:40:51.160 --> 3:40:52.160]  like you do.
[3:40:52.160 --> 3:40:54.080]  I appreciate it because you don't go off on the tangents.
[3:40:54.080 --> 3:40:57.880]  You know, you try and wake people up with 9-11 just by focusing on World Trade Center
[3:40:57.880 --> 3:41:02.000]  7, the economy, just what the, you know, the constitution specifically states who can
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:03.960]  print money, et cetera.
[3:41:03.960 --> 3:41:07.760]  And you know, it's funny because my call was all about, you know, where is the solution?
[3:41:07.760 --> 3:41:09.160]  You know, where are we going to find the solution?
[3:41:09.160 --> 3:41:13.040]  Well, in my opinion, it's too late because a lot of people I know are waking up, you
[3:41:13.040 --> 3:41:18.400]  know, either through your videos or just through me giving them the primary source materials
[3:41:18.400 --> 3:41:19.760]  or their white papers.
[3:41:19.760 --> 3:41:23.520]  And they realize that, hey, you know, we're being shafted here.
[3:41:23.520 --> 3:41:27.200]  And you know, like you stated before, you know, the governors are on the payroll, the
[3:41:27.200 --> 3:41:31.040]  state legislatures are on the payroll, the local people are on the payroll.
[3:41:31.040 --> 3:41:34.480]  And it's getting to a point now where, you know, what else is there left for us to do?
[3:41:34.480 --> 3:41:38.440]  I mean, how much more information do we need to find out about that they're completely
[3:41:38.440 --> 3:41:39.440]  shafting us?
[3:41:39.440 --> 3:41:40.440]  Well, you know all about it.
[3:41:40.440 --> 3:41:41.440]  Hold on.
[3:41:41.440 --> 3:41:45.560]  You know all about it, but the general public still doesn't know all of it or even a lot
[3:41:45.560 --> 3:41:47.200]  of it or even a little bit of it.
[3:41:47.200 --> 3:41:48.200]  They know they're being lied to.
[3:41:48.200 --> 3:41:51.480]  They know there's a tyranny, but they don't have the details.
[3:41:51.480 --> 3:41:55.800]  And so it's up to you to carry the ball, to use a football analogy, and to get out there
[3:41:55.800 --> 3:41:56.800]  and wake them up, sir.
[3:41:56.800 --> 3:41:58.800]  I mean, if it isn't going to be you, it's going to be nobody.
[3:41:58.800 --> 3:42:00.960]  No, and I understand that, Mr. Jones.
[3:42:00.960 --> 3:42:01.960]  But my concern is as follows.
[3:42:01.960 --> 3:42:04.000]  I mean, they've already done the damage they need to do.
[3:42:04.000 --> 3:42:10.200]  I mean, here you have a private banking consortium that is basically raping, you know, solvent
[3:42:10.200 --> 3:42:11.200]  companies.
[3:42:11.200 --> 3:42:16.080]  You have people that are in power that are keeping other people on a low conscious brain
[3:42:16.080 --> 3:42:17.080]  wave state.
[3:42:17.080 --> 3:42:21.160]  So, even though you're waking people up, you know, bit by bit, you know, we know the damage
[3:42:21.160 --> 3:42:25.080]  is done and we've gone through the regular process of stating, hey, listen.
[3:42:25.080 --> 3:42:26.080]  No.
[3:42:26.080 --> 3:42:27.080]  Hold on.
[3:42:27.080 --> 3:42:29.960]  We tell them that cell phones are frying their brains, quit using them as much.
[3:42:29.960 --> 3:42:34.600]  We explain that TV with a flicker rate and the different images and the subliminals is
[3:42:34.600 --> 3:42:35.760]  mesmerizing them.
[3:42:35.760 --> 3:42:40.360]  That's mainline science that you go into a dream state, a waking dream state.
[3:42:40.360 --> 3:42:41.520]  You educate them about that.
[3:42:41.520 --> 3:42:45.080]  I mean, look, things are bad, but all we can do is fight back against it.
[3:42:45.080 --> 3:42:48.200]  I guarantee it, we weren't fighting back against it to be a lot worse.
[3:42:48.200 --> 3:42:50.080]  Here's an example.
[3:42:50.080 --> 3:42:54.720]  They already met by this year to have what, nine major Austin roads in the city, Betol
[3:42:54.720 --> 3:42:55.720]  roads.
[3:42:55.720 --> 3:42:57.520]  They've only got like one and a couple outside.
[3:42:57.520 --> 3:42:59.680]  I mean, we've held back 90% of their crap.
[3:42:59.680 --> 3:43:01.480]  That's one microcosm example.
[3:43:01.480 --> 3:43:03.760]  You got the North American Union, right?
[3:43:03.760 --> 3:43:04.960]  You got the North American Union.
[3:43:04.960 --> 3:43:09.120]  They had their deal was to have it done by the end of 2005.
[3:43:09.120 --> 3:43:10.160]  Guess what?
[3:43:10.160 --> 3:43:11.560]  We screwed them up.
[3:43:11.560 --> 3:43:12.560]  We're making it.
[3:43:12.560 --> 3:43:13.560]  We're making it.
[3:43:13.560 --> 3:43:17.360]  We're, it's falling apart, but I mean, I mean, I know what are you saying?
[3:43:17.360 --> 3:43:18.360]  I'm trying to get out.
[3:43:18.360 --> 3:43:20.480]  I mean, the writing on the wall is already there.
[3:43:20.480 --> 3:43:24.360]  I mean, just the last month and a half of just the events that's going on, just what
[3:43:24.360 --> 3:43:32.880]  the federal reserve, for instance, yeah, but as, as the, as the tyranny unfolds here, Bob,
[3:43:32.880 --> 3:43:33.880]  you got a cough button right there.
[3:43:33.880 --> 3:43:34.880]  Let me show you.
[3:43:34.880 --> 3:43:35.880]  You just hit that when you cough.
[3:43:35.880 --> 3:43:38.840]  It won't be as long as the tyranny unfolds.
[3:43:38.840 --> 3:43:40.280]  Everything we said is coming true.
[3:43:40.280 --> 3:43:41.520]  Our credibility goes up.
[3:43:41.520 --> 3:43:42.520]  It's a fight, sir.
[3:43:42.520 --> 3:43:43.840]  And look, I appreciate your call.
[3:43:43.840 --> 3:43:47.280]  I know stuff's bad, but you know, I need to get to all the calls and I just can't sit
[3:43:47.280 --> 3:43:48.520]  here and put out glim and doom.
[3:43:48.520 --> 3:43:50.280]  I mean, people think I glim and doom.
[3:43:50.280 --> 3:43:53.000]  I'm just breaking down what the enemy plans to do.
[3:43:53.000 --> 3:43:55.280]  All I know is we have to fight it.
[3:43:55.280 --> 3:43:57.920]  Now let's go ahead and play that Lou Dobbs clip.
[3:43:57.920 --> 3:44:00.880]  It's only about a minute and a half long of them talking about the North American Union.
[3:44:00.880 --> 3:44:01.880]  Here it is.
[3:44:01.880 --> 3:44:08.600]  Again, the fight against the North American Union is escalating.
[3:44:08.600 --> 3:44:10.840]  What happened with that clip?
[3:44:10.840 --> 3:44:15.200]  The fight against the North American Union is escalating, not at the federal level, but
[3:44:15.200 --> 3:44:16.720]  at the state level.
[3:44:16.720 --> 3:44:22.200]  Currently, 14 states are considering legislation opposing what the administration calls the
[3:44:22.200 --> 3:44:24.800]  security and prosperity partnership.
[3:44:24.800 --> 3:44:29.760]  In Idaho, the measure has been approved by both houses of its legislature because Idaho
[3:44:29.760 --> 3:44:31.680]  is tired of the secrecy.
[3:44:31.680 --> 3:44:37.120]  In a simple statement from one of the Senate sponsors, he explains, quote, Idaho wants
[3:44:37.120 --> 3:44:42.160]  Congress to weigh in on this and get it out in the open and vote on it.
[3:44:42.160 --> 3:44:46.400]  At the federal level, it's hard to escape the push for unifying Canada, Mexico and the
[3:44:46.400 --> 3:44:47.600]  United States.
[3:44:47.600 --> 3:44:51.680]  The language is everywhere, even though the people have never voted on it.
[3:44:51.680 --> 3:44:56.800]  In last year's failed so-called comprehensive immigration reform bill, the Senate inserted
[3:44:56.800 --> 3:45:02.000]  language praising the North American Union for progress made, quote, in developing and
[3:45:02.000 --> 3:45:08.960]  implementing an immigration security strategy for North America that works towards the development
[3:45:08.960 --> 3:45:11.680]  of a common security perimeter.
[3:45:11.680 --> 3:45:16.600]  In other words, gone are the borders of the United States of America, welcome to the borders
[3:45:16.600 --> 3:45:18.400]  of North America.
[3:45:18.400 --> 3:45:21.440]  It's a far cry from what's happening at the state level.
[3:45:21.440 --> 3:45:26.280]  The state activity is an indication of the grassroots concern about this issue.
[3:45:26.280 --> 3:45:30.600]  The states are closer to the grassroots, and that's where you're going to first see the
[3:45:30.600 --> 3:45:36.160]  indication of some discomfort with the security-prosperity partnership or the idea of a North American
[3:45:36.160 --> 3:45:37.160]  Union.
[3:45:37.160 --> 3:45:43.280]  Washington isn't listening, just as Washington has ignored the people on the issue of immigration.
[3:45:43.280 --> 3:45:45.160]  Bill Tucker, CNN, New York.
[3:45:45.160 --> 3:45:49.120]  Okay, so I don't want your comment on this briefly, Bob, and I want to get to all these
[3:45:49.120 --> 3:45:50.120]  calls.
[3:45:50.120 --> 3:45:53.880]  David and Ahmed and Scott and Aaron, everybody else.
[3:45:53.880 --> 3:45:54.880]  And Ryan's back from Costa Rica.
[3:45:54.880 --> 3:45:55.880]  We'll go to him first, actually.
[3:45:55.880 --> 3:45:59.080]  I think I've ever had, actually I've had a few calls from Costa Rica.
[3:45:59.080 --> 3:46:01.680]  I kind of have a map on the wall of all the calls.
[3:46:01.680 --> 3:46:05.560]  I've got McMurtle, Weather Station, Antarctica, places like that.
[3:46:05.560 --> 3:46:06.760]  You listen to that.
[3:46:06.760 --> 3:46:10.280]  The feds come in, they sign all the documents, we're going into the North American Union.
[3:46:10.280 --> 3:46:13.400]  They're lawsuits for four-year documents, traditional watch gets them.
[3:46:13.400 --> 3:46:15.040]  It's all happening.
[3:46:15.040 --> 3:46:19.960]  The public documents say NAU, and the feds keep denying it and saying it doesn't exist,
[3:46:19.960 --> 3:46:23.560]  and the states are waking up and saying, look, you're liars, it's coming into our states.
[3:46:23.560 --> 3:46:24.760]  We're saying no.
[3:46:24.760 --> 3:46:28.360]  So see, once the government's exposed as being illegitimate and a pack of criminals
[3:46:28.360 --> 3:46:33.600]  bought and paid for by foreign banks, they lose all illegit- they lose all legitimacy.
[3:46:33.600 --> 3:46:38.760]  They're now illegitimate, and they lose public support and acquiescence, and they can only
[3:46:38.760 --> 3:46:43.720]  go so far with the tyranny when the people and the system starts saying no.
[3:46:43.720 --> 3:46:47.480]  The word has to get out that crooks are running things, and they're only going to make things
[3:46:47.480 --> 3:46:49.760]  worse because they're totally ruthless.
[3:46:49.760 --> 3:46:50.760]  We are winning.
[3:46:50.760 --> 3:46:52.840]  The North American Union is exposed.
[3:46:52.840 --> 3:46:55.800]  The people that were told it didn't exist now know the media lied.
[3:46:55.800 --> 3:47:00.240]  Okay, I mean, when CNN and Fox came out and said the Trans-Texas corridor didn't exist,
[3:47:00.240 --> 3:47:03.880]  as billboards were going up in Texas as the governor was announcing it, that woke everybody
[3:47:03.880 --> 3:47:05.760]  up in Texas right there.
[3:47:05.760 --> 3:47:07.800]  This level of lying is going to backfire.
[3:47:07.800 --> 3:47:08.800]  Bob Desi.
[3:47:08.800 --> 3:47:12.720]  And, you know, another example of that last year when The Nation magazine came out with
[3:47:12.720 --> 3:47:17.360]  that big front-page article that said that the North, you know, that the Trans-Texas corridor
[3:47:17.360 --> 3:47:22.440]  was real, but the NAFTA Superhighway was something that we nutty conspiracy theorists made up
[3:47:22.440 --> 3:47:26.960]  when they went out with public with that thing, we counter-attacked them immediately.
[3:47:26.960 --> 3:47:29.880]  Heck, I was doing your show when that happened.
[3:47:29.880 --> 3:47:35.440]  And what happened when the guy that wrote the article was on the Washington Journal,
[3:47:35.440 --> 3:47:38.440]  every call he got was blasting him because they were calling him a liar.
[3:47:38.440 --> 3:47:39.440]  Darrell Bock Yeah, it was over 90%.
[3:47:39.440 --> 3:47:40.440]  Bob Desi.
[3:47:40.440 --> 3:47:41.440]  Yeah, it was ridiculous.
[3:47:41.440 --> 3:47:44.280]  You know, he was sitting there trying to defend his ridiculous article for which there
[3:47:44.280 --> 3:47:45.280]  was no defense.
[3:47:45.280 --> 3:47:46.280]  We are winning this.
[3:47:46.280 --> 3:47:48.720]  Darrell Bock Folks, we are winning the hearts and minds.
[3:47:48.720 --> 3:47:50.520]  We need to have a winner's attitude.
[3:47:50.520 --> 3:47:53.680]  It's a tough road to go up, but it's the only road we've got and we've got to kick butt
[3:47:53.680 --> 3:47:54.680]  here, folks.
[3:47:54.680 --> 3:47:56.720]  Let's go to Ryan in Costa Rica.
[3:47:56.720 --> 3:47:57.720]  You're on the air, Ryan.
[3:47:57.720 --> 3:47:58.720]  Ryan Rees Alec.
[3:47:58.720 --> 3:47:59.720]  It's an honor to be on.
[3:47:59.720 --> 3:48:00.720]  I've been listening for years.
[3:48:00.720 --> 3:48:07.440]  These times right now, I figured I had to call in and talk to you.
[3:48:07.440 --> 3:48:10.160]  I want to bother asking you how you're doing right now.
[3:48:10.160 --> 3:48:15.640]  I know the United States is under complete attack and I can't even sleep right now.
[3:48:15.640 --> 3:48:20.480]  I'm just paying such close attention, listening to all four hours of your show, every single
[3:48:20.480 --> 3:48:25.880]  day, doing all the research and just trying to find solutions like you're saying.
[3:48:25.880 --> 3:48:29.360]  In contrast to that last caller, I think it's not true.
[3:48:29.360 --> 3:48:34.520]  I think really what I'm noticing right now is people are asking me what I've been telling
[3:48:34.520 --> 3:48:35.520]  them for years.
[3:48:35.520 --> 3:48:37.640]  They're like, what you told me is true.
[3:48:37.640 --> 3:48:38.640]  It's coming true.
[3:48:38.640 --> 3:48:43.000]  Things are happening like you said and I'm finding that people are so open to the information
[3:48:43.000 --> 3:48:44.000]  right now.
[3:48:44.000 --> 3:48:45.000]  It's like, this is the time.
[3:48:45.000 --> 3:48:46.000]  Ryan Rees Exactly.
[3:48:46.000 --> 3:48:48.360]  And so many people in the reality movement, the awakening
[3:48:48.360 --> 3:48:52.680]  movement, the liberty movement, the history movement, people that study history, a lot
[3:48:52.680 --> 3:48:54.320]  of us have bad attitudes.
[3:48:54.320 --> 3:48:55.320]  Nobody cares.
[3:48:55.320 --> 3:48:56.320]  Nothing we can do.
[3:48:56.320 --> 3:48:57.320]  It's all over.
[3:48:57.320 --> 3:49:00.120]  Meanwhile, it's the greatest awakening ever.
[3:49:00.120 --> 3:49:03.040]  We need to maximize everything right now.
[3:49:03.040 --> 3:49:05.200]  The internet may not be here soon in its current form.
[3:49:05.200 --> 3:49:06.600]  They're openly trying to get rid of it.
[3:49:06.600 --> 3:49:09.280]  We need to use it while we've got it.
[3:49:09.280 --> 3:49:15.000]  Ryan Rees And watching Riddles and Stone last night and just realizing that these people
[3:49:15.000 --> 3:49:19.800]  have a true plan for what they're trying to do to us and they are working 24 hours a day
[3:49:19.800 --> 3:49:21.360]  against us.
[3:49:21.360 --> 3:49:27.800]  We got to wake up and work 24 hours a day against them and send out mass emails to everybody.
[3:49:27.800 --> 3:49:32.480]  Everyone needs to watch the free videos and just, I've got one I spent six hours making
[3:49:32.480 --> 3:49:36.520]  last night just to make it really nice and beautiful that people will look at it, hopefully
[3:49:36.520 --> 3:49:42.760]  and click on articles where mainstream media saying that Paulson is a dictator, that we're
[3:49:42.760 --> 3:49:46.880]  giving over all of our power to the banks and that the Federal Reserve is private.
[3:49:46.880 --> 3:49:49.600]  People are finally realizing it in mainstream.
[3:49:49.600 --> 3:49:51.600]  Ryan Rees By the way, we ended up getting that video
[3:49:51.600 --> 3:49:55.400]  clip from last week, a caller called in with the audio where they call in one of the heads
[3:49:55.400 --> 3:49:57.320]  of the World Bank and say the Federal Reserve is private.
[3:49:57.320 --> 3:49:58.320]  The guy goes, no, it's not.
[3:49:58.320 --> 3:49:59.320]  It's federal.
[3:49:59.320 --> 3:50:02.640]  Ryan Rees All right, listen, I appreciate your call from
[3:50:02.640 --> 3:50:03.640]  Costa Rica.
[3:50:03.640 --> 3:50:04.640]  We're out of time.
[3:50:04.640 --> 3:50:09.640]  Final segment coming up, I'm going to skip for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and the listeners
[3:50:09.640 --> 3:50:15.560]  at infowars.com on those streams, I'm going to skip this break.
[3:50:15.560 --> 3:50:20.640]  But for everybody else, I forgot, the big announcement that I forgot to do last hour,
[3:50:20.640 --> 3:50:24.600]  big announcement when we come back just briefly, big announcement about a Wednesday guest for
[3:50:24.600 --> 3:50:25.600]  two hours.
[3:50:25.600 --> 3:50:29.400]  This is going to make for some really informative and compelling radio.
[3:50:29.400 --> 3:50:32.920]  Okay, Bob, continue with the calls here.
[3:50:32.920 --> 3:50:35.040]  Who's up next here, John, in order?
[3:50:35.040 --> 3:50:43.480]  I'm mad in New York, I'm mad in New York, you're on the air, sir.
[3:50:43.480 --> 3:50:45.480]  Go ahead, I'm mad, you're on the air.
[3:50:45.480 --> 3:50:48.720]  How's it going, Mr. Jones, Mr. Dacey, so I'm going to be on the show.
[3:50:48.720 --> 3:50:50.040]  I'm honored to talk to you, I'm mad.
[3:50:50.040 --> 3:50:51.040]  What's on your, go ahead.
[3:50:51.040 --> 3:50:58.880]  I'm here from New York and I basically have a two-part, in the first part being, obviously,
[3:50:58.880 --> 3:51:02.680]  what is some advice on how we can want people living in major cities like New York City?
[3:51:02.680 --> 3:51:07.560]  Obviously, the movement is strong and the word of truth is getting out there, so as
[3:51:07.560 --> 3:51:13.880]  far as the major cities, besides the idea of time and food and then holding those type
[3:51:13.880 --> 3:51:16.800]  of things, what type of things should we expect to see?
[3:51:16.800 --> 3:51:23.160]  Well, I would tell you, if it goes into a full bore breakdown type depression, the worst
[3:51:23.160 --> 3:51:31.480]  places to be are in mega cities, the metropolises, like LA, New York, Chicago, there is nowhere
[3:51:31.480 --> 3:51:33.680]  worse than Manhattan.
[3:51:33.680 --> 3:51:35.000]  You're not in Manhattan, are you?
[3:51:35.000 --> 3:51:37.160]  Well, I'm in Brooklyn, yeah.
[3:51:37.160 --> 3:51:39.600]  So, you're across the water, then?
[3:51:39.600 --> 3:51:40.600]  Right.
[3:51:40.600 --> 3:51:45.280]  Well, that's not as bad, because at least you're tied into the mainland there.
[3:51:45.280 --> 3:51:47.880]  Just wake up your friends, family and neighbors.
[3:51:47.880 --> 3:51:51.520]  That way the public won't spy, won't tattle, we're together, they're going to say you're
[3:51:51.520 --> 3:51:55.840]  going to get food and shelter if you tattle on people, the feds are already saying that.
[3:51:55.840 --> 3:52:00.160]  Same stuff that the Nazis and the communists did, I mean, it's hellish, I'm not going
[3:52:00.160 --> 3:52:01.160]  to lie to you.
[3:52:01.160 --> 3:52:05.760]  They're putting us into full depression, full martial law to squeeze us and teach us to
[3:52:05.760 --> 3:52:06.760]  love them.
[3:52:06.760 --> 3:52:11.040]  Where, you know, oh, save me, government, they want a social engineer, everybody.
[3:52:11.040 --> 3:52:15.640]  Now, I would say also, stay away from big crowds and don't throw rocks at banks, you
[3:52:15.640 --> 3:52:16.640]  know.
[3:52:16.640 --> 3:52:17.640]  Good idea.
[3:52:17.640 --> 3:52:21.920]  Yeah, like people that will like to hired anarchists do, not all anarchists, the hired
[3:52:21.920 --> 3:52:24.240]  ones do, so they have a pretext to attack peaceful crowds.
[3:52:24.240 --> 3:52:30.120]  Just don't do anything stupid, don't give them an excuse, stay away from crowds.
[3:52:30.120 --> 3:52:31.360]  This year I'll try to whip people up.
[3:52:31.360 --> 3:52:33.680]  Well, I'm talking about, you know, the violent crowds, you know.
[3:52:33.680 --> 3:52:34.680]  Talking about their martial law.
[3:52:34.680 --> 3:52:38.360]  Yeah, don't be doing that, because then you're going to be, you're going to be a sound cannon
[3:52:38.360 --> 3:52:39.360]  fodder.
[3:52:39.360 --> 3:52:42.920]  Well, it's going to happen, they're going to turn these sound cannons on and somebody's
[3:52:42.920 --> 3:52:46.600]  going to end up pulling out a rifle and that sound cannon is going to go down real fast,
[3:52:46.600 --> 3:52:50.200]  which is, and then the war starts and I don't want that, Bob, but I think you're going to
[3:52:50.200 --> 3:52:52.440]  end up, I think hell's going to blow up.
[3:52:52.440 --> 3:52:57.600]  And a whole bunch of civil disobedience on the part of the police and on the part of
[3:52:57.600 --> 3:53:01.880]  the military, just kind of go through the motions and don't do what they tell you.
[3:53:01.880 --> 3:53:02.880]  Because that's patriotism.
[3:53:02.880 --> 3:53:04.080]  You think that's going to happen?
[3:53:04.080 --> 3:53:05.560]  I think it's going to happen.
[3:53:05.560 --> 3:53:08.880]  A lot of the police, a lot of the military are going to say, I'm not going to participate
[3:53:08.880 --> 3:53:13.840]  in this garbage because I got kids, I got grandkids and I got, I want a future for America
[3:53:13.840 --> 3:53:17.440]  and I think a lot of the police are just going to just kind of go through the motions and
[3:53:17.440 --> 3:53:18.920]  say, I will not participate.
[3:53:18.920 --> 3:53:21.320]  All right, I got to jump, I appreciate your call.
[3:53:21.320 --> 3:53:25.960]  We're going to come back and talk to Scott Aaron and Dick and that's going to be it
[3:53:25.960 --> 3:53:29.080]  in the final segment here.
[3:53:29.080 --> 3:53:30.080]  Here we go.
[3:53:30.080 --> 3:53:33.080]  Back to the full audience.
[3:53:33.080 --> 3:53:39.120]  Okay, remember, I haven't even plugged my videos, this whole show, other than saying
[3:53:39.120 --> 3:53:42.600]  get them, make copies of them, but the best film is out there, in my opinion, Terrorist
[3:53:42.600 --> 3:53:46.640]  War, I think is the best film on government sponsored terrorism and exactly who we're dealing
[3:53:46.640 --> 3:53:47.640]  with.
[3:53:47.640 --> 3:53:52.160]  Some of the other sponsors that make this show possible, eFoodsDirect.com, Big Banners
[3:53:52.160 --> 3:53:57.880]  at the top of infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, it is the longest continually operating storeable
[3:53:57.880 --> 3:54:05.600]  foods company in the nation and they're just great folks and so we really hope that everybody
[3:54:05.600 --> 3:54:10.680]  will check out eFoodsDirect.com, get a free brochure, a free audio CD about the great
[3:54:10.680 --> 3:54:13.160]  storeable foods that they have, high quality.
[3:54:13.160 --> 3:54:16.320]  With all the uncertainty that we're living under, it is more important than ever to be
[3:54:16.320 --> 3:54:20.240]  self-sufficient and that's my message for people going into these trying times.
[3:54:20.240 --> 3:54:28.720]  Eat food, have firearms, don't go out offensively, look for trouble, but protect yourself, 800-409-563-800409-5633
[3:54:28.720 --> 3:54:34.720]  or eFoodsDirect.com and then lastly, Acola Blue are these great atmospheric water generators,
[3:54:34.720 --> 3:54:40.040]  they just grab the water out of the air, sends it through five different filters, we have
[3:54:40.040 --> 3:54:48.640]  links up on infowars.com to Acola Blue, it's spelled E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com, AcolaBlue.com
[3:54:48.640 --> 3:54:55.680]  or give them a call 866-585-4044, 866-585-4044, atmospheric water generator, seven and a
[3:54:55.680 --> 3:55:00.320]  half gallons a day, five different filters, it goes through, AcolaBlue.com, banner on
[3:55:00.320 --> 3:55:01.320]  infowars.com.
[3:55:01.320 --> 3:55:05.520]  Let's jam in here, I guess Scott in Arizona is up next.
[3:55:05.520 --> 3:55:07.640]  Hey Alex, how are you buddy?
[3:55:07.640 --> 3:55:08.640]  Good sir, go ahead.
[3:55:08.640 --> 3:55:12.800]  Get to find out, how, I mean I didn't get to catch all your show today, but how long
[3:55:12.800 --> 3:55:16.880]  do you think, I know they got the points up 700 or the plus right now, how long do you
[3:55:16.880 --> 3:55:19.280]  think that'll last before it drops back down again?
[3:55:19.280 --> 3:55:24.320]  I think it'll last two weeks, maybe a month and then it's going to stop, start plunging
[3:55:24.320 --> 3:55:29.000]  again, they'll say we need even more power, more infusions, more nationalization, more
[3:55:29.000 --> 3:55:34.760]  imperial power for the banks, but that's not what's going to matter, people are obsessing
[3:55:34.760 --> 3:55:38.640]  on their pension funds, when they cash it out it won't matter because it's going to
[3:55:38.640 --> 3:55:43.320]  be in devalued dollars, so it's the hyperinflation that's going to kill us and that's already
[3:55:43.320 --> 3:55:47.480]  here, but it's going to intensify in the next 24 months, I mean it's going to be just
[3:55:47.480 --> 3:55:48.480]  unbelievable.
[3:55:48.480 --> 3:55:52.160]  That's what I thought, thank you Alex.
[3:55:52.160 --> 3:55:54.120]  Thank you, I appreciate that.
[3:55:54.120 --> 3:56:01.640]  Now let's go ahead and go to another caller, let's talk to Aaron in Idaho, Aaron in Idaho,
[3:56:01.640 --> 3:56:02.640]  you're on the air.
[3:56:02.640 --> 3:56:06.560]  Alex, it's great to hear from you, I love your show, number one, the timing couldn't
[3:56:06.560 --> 3:56:12.760]  be better for my call, I'm all about solutions and versus problems, and I believe that what
[3:56:12.760 --> 3:56:16.840]  we need to focus on here is everything you're presenting is the orientation of consciousness
[3:56:16.840 --> 3:56:17.840]  on the solutions.
[3:56:17.840 --> 3:56:18.840]  Well what's the solution?
[3:56:18.840 --> 3:56:22.840]  The solution is unity, getting everybody together on the same page.
[3:56:22.840 --> 3:56:26.600]  Now I think that we have reached a sort of a critical mass of people because I know that
[3:56:26.600 --> 3:56:30.680]  everybody I've talked to out there has some sort of an inclination or feeling that something's
[3:56:30.680 --> 3:56:35.240]  not right, they know something's a mess, it's not just America, it's all over the world.
[3:56:35.240 --> 3:56:41.240]  So what my thought is is that what we've got to do is just focus our consciousness on the
[3:56:41.240 --> 3:56:45.720]  solution which is coming together and just hang it up our problem hats for a little bit
[3:56:45.720 --> 3:56:50.440]  until it's elections over anyways, and get together, get everybody out there to vote
[3:56:50.440 --> 3:56:54.080]  for a third party candidate, I don't care if it screws up the election, the bottom line
[3:56:54.080 --> 3:56:58.680]  here is the show of numbers and when people across the world see that the United States
[3:56:58.680 --> 3:57:03.000]  have come together to, in this big of numbers, they're going to jump on the bandwagon, they're
[3:57:03.000 --> 3:57:06.040]  going to wake up even more.
[3:57:06.040 --> 3:57:10.120]  I appreciate your call, we've got to be careful not to get into too much new agey stuff because
[3:57:10.120 --> 3:57:14.120]  we're going to get into where they think positive and everybody's basically sitting out in piles
[3:57:14.120 --> 3:57:16.120]  of crap on the side of the road.
[3:57:16.120 --> 3:57:20.920]  All you Christians out there, I think it would help to pray too, because we've got
[3:57:20.920 --> 3:57:21.920]  that.
[3:57:21.920 --> 3:57:25.520]  Well, I mean that's what he means, I mean focusing on good, thinking of ideas coming
[3:57:25.520 --> 3:57:30.040]  together, I agree with you sir, but we also need to put those ideas into action.
[3:57:30.040 --> 3:57:35.360]  I'm sorry to Dick and a couple other callers, call me back tomorrow and you'll go to the
[3:57:35.360 --> 3:57:36.360]  head of the line.
[3:57:36.360 --> 3:57:37.360]  Bob Desi, thanks for coming in.
[3:57:37.360 --> 3:57:38.360]  Thank you very much, Alex, I appreciate it.
[3:57:38.360 --> 3:57:39.360]  Keep up the good work.
[3:57:39.360 --> 3:57:40.360]  Thank you.
[3:57:40.360 --> 3:57:41.360]  And your website?
[3:57:41.360 --> 3:57:42.360]  SimultruthOnline.net, SimultruthOnline.net.
[3:57:42.360 --> 3:57:43.360]  Go there.
[3:57:43.360 --> 3:57:44.360]  SimultruthOnline.net.
[3:57:44.360 --> 3:57:50.700]  And if you live in Austin, Texas, you can see reruns of a show, in the live show, checking,
[3:57:50.700 --> 3:57:55.800]  you can check the TV Guide to other information and it's there once a week.
[3:57:55.800 --> 3:58:01.460]  All right, rebroadcasts with the economic historian William Engdahl and others, right
