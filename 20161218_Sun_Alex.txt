[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  We are on the March. The Empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:10.000 --> 00:14.000]  It's Sunday night. We're live. First to John Bown Report.
[00:14.000 --> 00:24.000]  Every official in Hawaii, Democrat and Republican, every news outlet that has investigated this,
[00:24.000 --> 00:31.000]  confirm that yes, in fact, I was born in Hawaii, August 4, 1961 in Kapiolani Hospital.
[00:31.000 --> 00:39.000]  Here we are. I'm going to cut this layer. Boom. And now we're going to add it to a different layer on top of that other layer.
[00:39.000 --> 00:46.000]  And now you can see this is a completely different layer and there's even a missing number on this when you bring this back in.
[00:46.000 --> 00:53.000]  So this one was here originally, but then they added these numbers it looks like. Watch the signature here.
[00:53.000 --> 01:02.000]  Part of the signature's there and part of it's not. They add the numbers one here and over here there's a three and a one added.
[01:02.000 --> 01:07.000]  You can just see by turning it on and off, you know, there's different letters all over this that have been added into it.
[01:07.000 --> 01:14.000]  Obama's birth certificate has been proven by two leading experts in forensic fraud documentation to be a forgery.
[01:14.000 --> 01:26.000]  Let me tell you about Reed Hayes, a man with 40 years since 1974, 40 plus years of experience in examining forensic document, handwriting,
[01:26.000 --> 01:37.000]  a man who's well respected in his expertise, a court recognized expert, a document examiner.
[01:37.000 --> 01:45.000]  Mr. Hayes told me right off the bat, I'm an Obama supporter. I voted for him twice.
[01:45.000 --> 01:49.000]  He goes, and I will never do anything to hurt the President of the United States.
[01:49.000 --> 01:54.000]  What I had said to him was, Reed, I am not asking you to hurt the President of the United States.
[01:54.000 --> 02:00.000]  I'm asking you to take a look at this document and clear it and tell me there's nothing wrong with it.
[02:00.000 --> 02:03.000]  Would you at least do that?
[02:03.000 --> 02:11.000]  And he took a look at it, and when he called me back, he told me, Mike, I can't clear this, there's something wrong with it.
[02:11.000 --> 02:19.000]  His way utilized forensic document examiners, Reed Hayes in Hawaii and a company named Four Labs in Italy.
[02:19.000 --> 02:24.000]  Four Labs trains law enforcement throughout Europe.
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  Four Labs, everybody in that building is a PhD. These guys know their stuff.
[02:29.000 --> 02:39.000]  And I'm going to tell you what I respect about both of them. Both Reed Hayes and Marco at Four Labs stay true to their discipline.
[02:39.000 --> 02:46.000]  These men cannot be pushed. This is their findings. This is how they see it, and this is how they're calling it.
[02:46.000 --> 02:54.000]  These births took place in Honolulu during the month of August in 1961, just 16 days apart.
[02:54.000 --> 03:03.000]  The birth certificate on the left belongs to Barack Obama. The birth certificate on the right belongs to Johanna Onni.
[03:03.000 --> 03:11.000]  It is the opinion of the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office that the birth certificate on your right belonging to Johanna Onni
[03:11.000 --> 03:19.000]  was in fact used as a source document in the digital creation of Barack Obama's long-form birth certificate.
[03:19.000 --> 03:25.000]  They concluded that it is a thousand times more probable that the document is inauthentic.
[03:25.000 --> 03:30.000]  They also concluded that if they had a greater sampling, that number would be higher.
[03:30.000 --> 03:40.000]  Because they have concluded that that document, it is highly improbable, next to impossible, that you will find another document with a reanomaly we just showed you.
[03:40.000 --> 03:50.000]  To read Hayes' conclusion, the evidence noted herein is clear and convincing proof that the Obama certificate of live birth,
[03:50.000 --> 04:01.000]  posted on WhiteHouse.gov on April 27, 2011, is a fraudulently manufactured document.
[04:01.000 --> 04:12.000]  Evidence indicates that the certificate of live birth of Johanna Onni is one source utilized in the construction of the certificate of live birth.
[04:12.000 --> 04:24.000]  Read Hayes' own words. The parentheses now in the coffin close parentheses that provides the certificate of live birth is inauthentic,
[04:24.000 --> 04:33.000]  is the exact lineup of numerous entries on both the certificate of live birth and the Onni certificate.
[04:33.000 --> 04:41.000]  Impeaching Obama now with roughly 30 days until President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration seems like a non-event.
[04:41.000 --> 04:45.000]  But if we are truly entering a new era in the history of the United States,
[04:45.000 --> 04:52.000]  it would send a clear message to the criminal despots that have hijacked our government, our media, our medical system,
[04:52.000 --> 04:58.000]  right down to the monopoly money in our wallets, that no matter what diabolical infiltration is,
[05:23.000 --> 05:29.000]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[05:29.000 --> 05:40.000]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie, and beef was for supper.
[05:40.000 --> 05:46.000]  Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available,
[05:46.000 --> 05:52.000]  starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General, Jerry Boykin.
[05:52.000 --> 06:21.000]  Let's shed some tears over the red, white and blue, Revelation, the movie.info. Let's fix it.
[06:21.000 --> 06:26.000]  I believe it's already Sunday, December 18, 2016.
[06:26.000 --> 06:34.000]  We're now only 32 days out from the historic seating of the 45th President of the United States,
[06:34.000 --> 06:40.000]  Donald J. Trump, but the powers of globalism are pulling out all the stops to try to stop that.
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. Thank you so much for joining us today.
[06:44.000 --> 06:51.000]  You know, a lot of historians have pointed out that when they go back and talk to the people that live through incredible historic events,
[06:51.000 --> 06:56.000]  most people didn't recognize it at the time.
[06:56.000 --> 07:01.000]  And what I've noticed is we'll raise the alarm bell about the private fellow reserve,
[07:01.000 --> 07:07.000]  or about Obamacare being a rip-off, or about how the globalists plan to open up our borders.
[07:07.000 --> 07:13.000]  And we'll tell people many years before it happens, because we're reading it out of establishment white papers,
[07:13.000 --> 07:16.000]  or watching meetings on C-SPAN.
[07:16.000 --> 07:20.000]  Most of this isn't even secret. It's just not widely publicized.
[07:20.000 --> 07:23.000]  The globalists pretty much operate out in plain view.
[07:23.000 --> 07:29.000]  But it's so academic what they do, the average person isn't concerned, because they're too busy, again, watching the NFL,
[07:29.000 --> 07:33.000]  or going shopping. And quite frankly, I don't blame them.
[07:33.000 --> 07:41.000]  But if you want to be free, you've got to be informed, and you've got to be focused, and you've got to be aware of what's happening.
[07:41.000 --> 07:45.000]  And so much of what we've covered years before has now taken place.
[07:45.000 --> 07:51.000]  And so, yes, people that pay attention, our credibility with them has gone up dramatically.
[07:51.000 --> 07:55.000]  But for those that don't pay attention, it's still somewhat of a novelty.
[07:55.000 --> 07:59.000]  And the mainstream media just kind of makes a joke about us. The standard joke is,
[07:59.000 --> 08:05.000]  oh, Alex Jones, he's the guy that believes in Shuba Cabras, and Bigfoot, and the Loch Ness Monster, and Flying Saucers.
[08:05.000 --> 08:14.000]  They don't cover any of those subjects, but when they attack us on The Daily Show, or CNN, or vice on HBO,
[08:14.000 --> 08:20.000]  or in Rolling Stone magazine, or the New York Daily News, or the LA Times, it just doesn't matter.
[08:20.000 --> 08:28.000]  They just say, Alex Jones believes that blood-drinking lizards run the world.
[08:28.000 --> 08:31.000]  They don't even have the right person.
[08:31.000 --> 08:39.000]  And the reason they're doing that is to try to psychologically inoculate their viewers
[08:39.000 --> 08:45.000]  into disbelieving and not trusting a strawman that they've built.
[08:45.000 --> 08:49.000]  A great example of this was about three weeks ago, NPR.
[08:49.000 --> 08:56.000]  And then publications across the United States began to run a quote.
[08:56.000 --> 09:03.000]  Rob is talking about Hillary being personally responsible for the rape and murder of thousands of children in Syria
[09:03.000 --> 09:10.000]  by knowingly sending in jihadi ISIS al-Qaeda forces who routinely engaged in the type of behavior.
[09:10.000 --> 09:14.000]  And the clip's only a minute, 18 seconds long. It's completely self-contained.
[09:14.000 --> 09:21.000]  It's very clear that I'm talking about the Middle East and North Africa,
[09:21.000 --> 09:27.000]  but they take it and cut the front and the end off to deceive their viewers
[09:27.000 --> 09:31.000]  and to deceive their listeners and to deceive their readers.
[09:31.000 --> 09:35.000]  And that works sometimes, but once viewers and listeners have caught them doing it a few times,
[09:35.000 --> 09:38.000]  they don't have any trust anymore.
[09:38.000 --> 09:44.000]  When I was in a restaurant today with some of the crew and having a meeting,
[09:44.000 --> 09:48.000]  kind of a Christmas brunch, so we don't have a big Christmas party this year.
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.000]  We just kind of take each department out.
[09:51.000 --> 09:54.000]  And as I was walking in the bathroom and back, two guys said,
[09:54.000 --> 10:00.000]  oh, it's Alex Jones that believes Hillary is chopping up children in the basement of a pizza place.
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.000]  And I looked at them and I said, that's right, and Bigfoot's helping her.
[10:04.000 --> 10:07.000]  Because they were laughing, wanting to have a false victory over me,
[10:07.000 --> 10:13.000]  and I just laughed with them at me because I was really laughing at the fact that they're still under mind control
[10:13.000 --> 10:17.000]  or they think it's going to intimidate me laughing at me.
[10:17.000 --> 10:20.000]  See, I know what I said. I know where my integrity lies.
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.000]  And because people want to have simulated victories in their heads, that's their problem.
[10:24.000 --> 10:26.000]  I've changed the world.
[10:26.000 --> 10:31.000]  I've put out many of the modern talking points that are counter to globalism.
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.000]  I sit there and hear Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, you name it,
[10:35.000 --> 10:38.000]  imitating me, not the other way around.
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.000]  I've changed the world.
[10:40.000 --> 10:41.000]  I've had a big effect.
[10:41.000 --> 10:45.000]  And I don't say that from some position of a power trip.
[10:45.000 --> 10:50.000]  I say that from position to listeners to understand how much power we have
[10:50.000 --> 10:56.000]  in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth as a revolutionary and seismic
[10:56.000 --> 11:02.000]  and very, very powerful act to paraphrase and expand on the words of Eric Blair,
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.000]  aka George Irwell.
[11:06.000 --> 11:09.000]  But that said, let me get into the big news today.
[11:09.000 --> 11:19.000]  I don't want everybody to listen to me very, very carefully because we saw this coming in 1996
[11:19.000 --> 11:25.000]  because I would read trade publications from the big Internet consortium meetings.
[11:25.000 --> 11:32.000]  And I was also being advised by former and current members of the National Security Agency
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.000]  who had become contractors with telecoms.
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.000]  And they said, hey kid, you're crazy enough to tell the truth.
[11:39.000 --> 11:41.000]  Let me tell you how things really work.
[11:41.000 --> 11:44.000]  Some of them were public, some of them were private.
[11:44.000 --> 11:47.000]  One was James Bamford, former Nightline head producer.
[11:47.000 --> 11:50.000]  The other was Wayne Madsen.
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  But others were private.
[11:52.000 --> 11:58.000]  And that's why if you go back to those shows from 97, 98, 99, 2000, right up to 2006,
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.000]  when mainstream media started admitting some of the NSA spying,
[12:01.000 --> 12:07.000]  I told you exactly how the NSA worked, the name of the programs,
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.000]  how they were controlling and predicting the future with the information,
[12:11.000 --> 12:17.000]  how they were manipulating trends, how it was basically mass culture control.
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.000]  And the first time I was talking to one of these big NSA engineers and he was a wealthy guy.
[12:21.000 --> 12:24.000]  He'd obviously had a lot of patents and things himself.
[12:24.000 --> 12:30.000]  He said, Alex, have you read the foundation series by Isaac Asimov?
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  And I said, yes.
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  He said, oh really, most people haven't.
[12:34.000 --> 12:37.000]  You know, he coined the term robot and he coined the robot rules and all that.
[12:37.000 --> 12:38.000]  He said, have you read it?
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  And he goes, have you read the series?
[12:40.000 --> 12:41.000]  I said, yes.
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  He goes, good, then you understand the actual plan.
[12:43.000 --> 12:49.000]  That was an envisioned plan by the Fabian Socialist 50 years before Isaac Asimov wrote it.
[12:49.000 --> 12:55.000]  He goes, you're familiar with the fact that they have basically programming in the science fiction,
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.000]  predictive programming is what it's called, so people accept things when they come in the future.
[13:00.000 --> 13:01.000]  And I said, yes.
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.000]  And he said, listen, look into it.
[13:04.000 --> 13:07.000]  That's the plan with the NSA grid.
[13:07.000 --> 13:13.000]  Now, if you read the foundation series, a mathematician envisions in the near future,
[13:13.000 --> 13:16.000]  it was like in the 2020s or so if I go from memory,
[13:16.000 --> 13:21.000]  that they would come up with a math algorithm to predict mass movements of populations
[13:21.000 --> 13:26.000]  that could data feed their activities into major data banks.
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.000]  And then they went out and they hired all the Eagle Scouts and all the big brainiacs
[13:30.000 --> 13:36.000]  in the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s to try to create it once the computers were up to the technological level they needed.
[13:36.000 --> 13:39.000]  Where do you think Michael Bloomberg comes from?
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  And it's $46 billion.
[13:41.000 --> 13:48.000]  Data mining terminals into the NSA to get all the businesses to pay for quote, Intel,
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.000]  but the businesses actually give Intel, which is then data mined into the larger NSA grid.
[13:53.000 --> 13:59.000]  So just like you think you're getting info from Google, it's getting a thousand times more info from you.
[13:59.000 --> 14:06.000]  So you think the Palantir, which is a real NSA system, is a one-way crystal ball.
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  Why should we be afraid to use it?
[14:08.000 --> 14:15.000]  Because others are lost and Sauron may be using it and then Gandalf throws the cloak over it.
[14:15.000 --> 14:22.000]  See, you're looking into a Palantir, it's looking right back at you using a child's allegory.
[14:22.000 --> 14:28.000]  So all of that said, when I come back, it's now not my analysis, it's not my prediction,
[14:28.000 --> 14:33.000]  it is now fact of how they're going to censor the web, how they're going to shut it down
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.000]  in the final phases of ending free speech in the United States and Europe.
[14:37.000 --> 14:42.000]  Now in Europe, they already arrested you if you mildly criticized Islam, left us anybody else.
[14:42.000 --> 14:51.000]  They're now doing $500 or announcing 500 pound, third time a charge, 500 euro, excuse me,
[14:51.000 --> 14:58.000]  no teleprompter here going from memory, 500 euro fines for quote, fake news,
[14:58.000 --> 15:06.000]  which is defined by George Soros consortiums that will simply go through all of the information
[15:06.000 --> 15:11.000]  and then basically start finding and feeding you and then finally removing you off the internet,
[15:11.000 --> 15:16.000]  because you're going to have an internet social score, which once it gets to a certain point,
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.000]  you're then kicked off the web and ostracized from the new technocracy.
[15:20.000 --> 15:25.000]  See, they get you in a technocracy, they make all commerce and jobs, rely on on technocracy,
[15:25.000 --> 15:28.000]  then they remove you from technocracy.
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  Remember a year ago, the Chinese came out and said,
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.000]  we're going to have social network scores for citizens, this is the new system of control.
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.000]  Well, when we come back, Communist China, the evidence is clear,
[15:43.000 --> 15:48.000]  is now launching hack attacks against Infowars.com and it gets worse.
[15:48.000 --> 15:55.000]  They're also openly running the rollout of censorship of quote, fake news in the United States.
[15:55.000 --> 16:23.000]  It's so sensational.
[16:25.000 --> 16:28.000]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products,
[16:28.000 --> 16:33.000]  we use decades old scientific research that puts together the Rolls Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[16:33.000 --> 16:38.000]  Look, there's a reason deep cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary,
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  it's by Jurex herbal processing technique.
[16:40.000 --> 16:44.000]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.000]  and we still bring it to you at the best price out there.
[16:47.000 --> 16:50.000]  If you wish to find deep cleanse and experience the all-in-one cleansing,
[16:50.000 --> 16:57.000]  visit InfowarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[17:20.000 --> 17:26.000]  In the history of InfowarsLife, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2,
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[17:28.000 --> 17:32.000]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today
[17:32.000 --> 17:38.000]  with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[17:38.000 --> 17:42.000]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[17:42.000 --> 17:49.000]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[17:49.000 --> 17:52.000]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure.
[17:52.000 --> 17:55.000]  At InfowarsLife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[17:55.000 --> 17:57.000]  Take action now before we sell out.
[17:58.000 --> 18:04.000]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.000]  Dr. Griff, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[18:08.000 --> 18:13.000]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[18:13.000 --> 18:19.000]  What the aging process is is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[18:19.000 --> 18:22.000]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[18:24.000 --> 18:28.000]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[18:28.000 --> 18:31.000]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[18:31.000 --> 18:33.000]  It works like an antioxidant.
[18:33.000 --> 18:36.000]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[18:36.000 --> 18:39.000]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[18:39.000 --> 18:40.000]  It's in powder form.
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.000]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[18:43.000 --> 18:44.000]  I take this.
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  This is the product that I take.
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.000]  InfowarsLife.com and the product we make.
[18:48.000 --> 18:49.000]  We fight the global.
[18:49.000 --> 18:50.000]  We fight the new world order.

[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  I want to tell you about a brand new often-read product.
[19:00.000 --> 19:02.000]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[19:02.000 --> 19:05.000]  Even though it's so small, you can put it in your pocket.
[19:05.000 --> 19:08.000]  It can actually run some 110 appliances at your house.
[19:08.000 --> 19:11.000]  Like small refrigerators to keep your food from spoiling.
[19:11.000 --> 19:14.000]  The best part, though, you can take it with you.
[19:14.000 --> 19:15.000]  It's mobile.
[19:15.000 --> 19:20.000]  To jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[19:20.000 --> 19:24.000]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity,
[19:24.000 --> 19:27.000]  basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[19:27.000 --> 19:28.000]  A true innovation.
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  I have never seen anything like this.
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.000]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[19:34.000 --> 19:39.000]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.
[19:39.000 --> 19:41.000]  Go to privatepowergrid.com.
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  That's privatepowergrid.com.

[19:58.000 --> 20:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:09.000 --> 20:15.000]  I've got a tiger by the tail that's way to sea.
[20:16.000 --> 20:20.000]  I won't be much when you get through with me.
[20:20.000 --> 20:22.000]  He never gives up.
[20:22.000 --> 20:24.000]  He's Alex Jones.
[20:24.000 --> 20:27.000]  Broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas.
[20:27.000 --> 20:29.000]  Worldwide.
[20:33.000 --> 20:34.000]  You know, it's up to us.
[20:34.000 --> 20:37.000]  If we stand up to the globalists and we scream bloody murder,
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  and we point out what they're doing,
[20:39.000 --> 20:41.000]  they've got a tiger by the tail.
[20:41.000 --> 20:45.000]  If we roll over and just let them define everything, it's over.
[20:45.000 --> 20:48.000]  Notice they define the Affordable Care Act as affordable
[20:48.000 --> 20:51.000]  when it was a giant rip-off written by foreign insurance companies
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.000]  to gang rape the American people.
[20:53.000 --> 20:57.000]  I mean, it's a fact that their profits went up 47 percent
[20:57.000 --> 20:59.000]  the first year globally on our backs.
[20:59.000 --> 21:02.000]  We got a group saying, yeah, I was hired a lot of the public.
[21:02.000 --> 21:04.000]  Thank God the public's so dumb.
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  Well, I don't think you're dumb.
[21:06.000 --> 21:09.000]  I think you want to, you know, be in a free and fair country,
[21:09.000 --> 21:13.000]  and you don't know what to do and stuff so corrupt in your life, too.
[21:13.000 --> 21:17.000]  And the American people are waking up.
[21:17.000 --> 21:20.000]  But I noticed that about five, six years ago,
[21:20.000 --> 21:25.000]  when Australia was about to pass Internet ID, fake news bands,
[21:25.000 --> 21:30.000]  their reporters that were still in their press that were doing their job
[21:30.000 --> 21:35.000]  said this is communist Chinese net censorship,
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  and then they found cases where Australian lawmakers
[21:38.000 --> 21:42.000]  with the federal government were meeting with the Chinese
[21:42.000 --> 21:45.000]  to pick their brains on how to bring in censorship.
[21:45.000 --> 21:49.000]  Now, that narrowly failed five years ago in Australia.
[21:49.000 --> 21:51.000]  Fake news at the time.
[21:51.000 --> 21:54.000]  And that's what's scary is that just five, six years ago,
[21:54.000 --> 21:58.000]  our media would criticize China when it was censoring the web
[21:58.000 --> 22:02.000]  and arresting members of the press and calling it fake news.
[22:02.000 --> 22:06.000]  Now, you never hear our media criticize their mobile execution vans
[22:06.000 --> 22:11.000]  or criticize their selling organs or criticize the censorship
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  or the arrest of Buddhists for no reason.
[22:13.000 --> 22:16.000]  I mean, they arrest you if you're doing Buddhism in your house
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.000]  and just meditating and stretching.
[22:18.000 --> 22:20.000]  They arrest you for yoga.
[22:20.000 --> 22:24.000]  That's what Falon Gong basically is.
[22:24.000 --> 22:28.000]  It's like that mixed in with some of the stuff that Japanese do is exercise.
[22:28.000 --> 22:33.000]  It's crazy.
[22:33.000 --> 22:37.000]  But again, they're threatened by it because they want the state to be God.
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.000]  They want total materialism.
[22:39.000 --> 22:45.000]  Communism is always threatened by spiritualism because it transcends the state.
[22:45.000 --> 22:49.000]  So then I saw Zuckerberg meet a whole bunch last year, a bunch this year.
[22:49.000 --> 22:54.000]  It's a total of 14 times I could find with the communist Chinese censors
[22:54.000 --> 22:58.000]  to line up Facebook with China's censorship policies and systems
[22:58.000 --> 23:02.000]  and to adopt their systems of censorship.
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.000]  And then he told Merkel and a hot mic.
[23:04.000 --> 23:05.000]  We played the clip like 15 times.
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  I'm not going to play it again.
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.000]  Everybody knows about that earlier this year.
[23:09.000 --> 23:10.000]  He got caught in a hot mic.
[23:10.000 --> 23:13.000]  She said, you got to do something to censor people criticizing the open borders
[23:13.000 --> 23:16.000]  and the migrants she was shipping in, 2 million of them, Germany alone last year.
[23:16.000 --> 23:17.000]  He said, don't worry, ma'am.
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  We're on it right now by the end of the year.
[23:19.000 --> 23:22.000]  And everybody's like, whoa, that's what Drudge said.
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  Whoa, it's happening.
[23:24.000 --> 23:28.000]  So what I'm telling you is this isn't a stretch.
[23:28.000 --> 23:31.000]  I've got a stack of news articles with the communist Chinese
[23:31.000 --> 23:37.000]  or in the Wall Street Journal, you name it, saying, well, there's the headline out of Forbes.
[23:37.000 --> 23:38.000]  I didn't even find that one.
[23:38.000 --> 23:39.000]  Print that for me.
[23:39.000 --> 23:43.000]  In business, the Chinese way, Facebook develops a censorship tool.
[23:43.000 --> 23:45.000]  See, I hadn't even found that, folks.
[23:45.000 --> 23:51.000]  There are so many hundreds of articles admitting that Facebook, well, it gets worse than that.
[23:51.000 --> 23:54.000]  They're not just hiring communist Chinese around it.
[23:54.000 --> 24:01.000]  That had been successful with a population four times the United States.
[24:01.000 --> 24:03.000]  Four times.
[24:03.000 --> 24:05.000]  Plus.
[24:05.000 --> 24:10.000]  Four times the US population and then add another 100 million.
[24:10.000 --> 24:13.000]  So, wow.
[24:13.000 --> 24:17.000]  Four times our population, almost as connected as we are.
[24:17.000 --> 24:19.000]  South Korea is the most connected in the world.
[24:19.000 --> 24:24.000]  And they've got pretty much total control.
[24:24.000 --> 24:29.000]  And they call it, oh, we don't censor fake news, but we arrest you for fake news, too.
[24:29.000 --> 24:33.000]  They're trying to pass bills to arrest people right now for quote, fake news.
[24:33.000 --> 24:37.000]  Meanwhile, the New York Times this week got caught running, not one, not two, not three, not four,
[24:37.000 --> 24:41.000]  more than 100,000 fake news stories.
[24:41.000 --> 24:42.000]  Oh, pull it up.
[24:42.000 --> 24:43.000]  Just type in.
[24:43.000 --> 24:48.000]  In an article about fake news, they run fake news.
[24:48.000 --> 24:49.000]  And it's an ad.
[24:49.000 --> 24:50.000]  I went and looked it up.
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  How many impressions it got.
[24:52.000 --> 24:53.000]  They admitted it later.
[24:53.000 --> 25:02.000]  Over 100,000 times, they ran a fake news story in their articles saying Alec Baldwin was dead.
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.000]  At 58.
[25:05.000 --> 25:12.000]  Now, by the way, that ad's not on ours because I have them daily review the Google third party advertising we've got,
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  where they place it on your site.
[25:14.000 --> 25:19.000]  Tim Projet every day at 7 a.m. when he gets to work has to go check what they're trying to load into my website.
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  So, I'm trying to cut it out.
[25:21.000 --> 25:22.000]  Yeah, there's a headline.
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.000]  New York Times airs ad for fake news and article about fake news.
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  And then they later had to admit it was over 100,000 impressions.
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.000]  Get this in the one article about fake news.
[25:32.000 --> 25:38.000]  So, they had 100,000 people read that and it was 100,000 times they ran it.
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  That's not counting all their other articles.
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  See, 100,000 sounds like a lot.
[25:42.000 --> 25:43.000]  There's a lot more than that.
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  That's just the one we can look at.
[25:45.000 --> 25:46.000]  So, here's the deal.
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  They're running it on purpose, making money out of it.
[25:48.000 --> 25:49.000]  True fake news.
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.000]  There are sites that say I'm dead every week.
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  There are sites that say Matt Drudge is dead every week.
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  There are sites saying George W. Bush is dead every week.
[25:56.000 --> 25:57.000]  It's not true.
[25:57.000 --> 26:01.000]  Baldwin Gone at 58 was the story.
[26:01.000 --> 26:02.000]  We don't do that.
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  The difference is do we get stuff wrong sometimes?
[26:04.000 --> 26:05.000]  Yes.
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  But see, it's called prior restraint.
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  We have to be proven in a court that we lied on purpose to hurt somebody.
[26:10.000 --> 26:11.000]  Never happened.
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.000]  Knock on wood.
[26:13.000 --> 26:17.000]  I had a guy once say lies about me and say I was a drug dealer and stuff.
[26:17.000 --> 26:18.000]  I had to sue him.
[26:18.000 --> 26:19.000]  He settled in court.
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  Never been a drug dealer hardly ever even used drugs.
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  Tried this and that out a few times in college.
[26:23.000 --> 26:24.000]  Hated it.
[26:24.000 --> 26:27.000]  I was like, people pay for this?
[26:27.000 --> 26:28.000]  This is horrible.
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  It's like an anxiety attack to take cocaine.
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  People think I'm on drugs.
[26:32.000 --> 26:33.000]  I'm on coffee.
[26:33.000 --> 26:38.000]  I'm upset about what's happening, but side issue.
[26:38.000 --> 26:39.000]  I had to sue somebody else.
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.000]  They were messing with my sister when she was still in high school.
[26:41.000 --> 26:42.000]  She's 15 years younger than me.
[26:42.000 --> 26:43.000]  14 years younger than me.
[26:43.000 --> 26:44.000]  Lied about her.
[26:44.000 --> 26:45.000]  I sued them.
[26:45.000 --> 26:46.000]  I won.
[26:46.000 --> 26:50.000]  The point is, is that if you want to prove something, put your money where your mouth is.
[26:50.000 --> 26:55.000]  America, every regime that censors says they're shutting down faker misleading news.
[26:55.000 --> 27:01.000]  But again, it's all labeling just like the communist Chinese come out and call it fake news.
[27:01.000 --> 27:04.000]  Just like Obama calls it affordable care act.
[27:04.000 --> 27:10.000]  Or now I've got an article where Bloomberg is interviewed this year telling Slate magazine,
[27:10.000 --> 27:16.000]  there's several others, that he is lying to the public now that he doesn't want to take our guns.
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.000]  And the stealth approach is getting them dividends to undermine the second amendment.
[27:19.000 --> 27:26.000]  I have them admitting they're deceiving us by incrementalism.
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[27:28.000 --> 27:33.000]  And because I fair it around 24 seven, digging all this up showing you they want to shut down.
[27:33.000 --> 27:34.000]  So we come back from break.
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  This affects everybody.
[27:36.000 --> 27:40.000]  But we are under attack by the president, former president, about to be.
[27:40.000 --> 27:41.000]  We are under attack by Hillary.
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  We are under attack by the EU naming us.
[27:43.000 --> 27:46.000]  We are in the Washington Post as Russian agents.
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  They had to retract it.
[27:48.000 --> 27:49.000]  But the EU doesn't care.
[27:49.000 --> 27:57.000]  They're using that list to call for the shutdown of M4Wars.com, DrudgeReport.com, and Breitbart.com.
[27:57.000 --> 28:00.000]  And if they could shut us down, folks, you're next.
[28:00.000 --> 28:06.000]  And they've hired Snopes and a mail order diploma company with six employees.
[28:06.000 --> 28:13.000]  You can't make this up to be the chief advisors to Facebook.
[28:13.000 --> 28:18.000]  Oh, Facebook isn't censoring you.
[28:18.000 --> 28:26.000]  This third party astroturf, you know, non-governmental organization, NGO, lapdog, it waved a magic wand.
[28:26.000 --> 28:27.000]  And it said so.
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  We're going to go to break here in a moment and come back.
[28:29.000 --> 28:33.000]  But we have the Chinese Communist in the news saying censor us.
[28:33.000 --> 28:39.000]  And our lapdog media going, thank God the Chinese, you mean Communist Chinese, murders, are here.
[28:39.000 --> 28:42.000]  Not the biggest censors in the world are now running our censorship.
[28:42.000 --> 28:43.000]  Red alert.
[28:43.000 --> 28:44.000]  Oh, my God.
[28:44.000 --> 28:45.000]  Oh, my God.
[28:45.000 --> 28:46.000]  It's like an invasion.
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  No, it's just like, oh, yeah, the Chinese are here to help.
[28:48.000 --> 28:49.000]  Shut down Alex Jones.
[28:49.000 --> 28:50.000]  Thank God, everybody.
[28:50.000 --> 28:51.000]  Yeah.
[28:51.000 --> 28:52.000]  Absolutely, man.
[28:52.000 --> 28:55.000]  Can't wait till we have mobile execution fans.
[28:55.000 --> 28:56.000]  It's all coming up.
[28:56.000 --> 29:04.000]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.
[29:04.000 --> 29:06.000]  We're making freedom go viral.

[33:01.000 --> 33:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:15.000 --> 33:18.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[33:18.000 --> 33:20.000]  And the heart of the Resistance.
[33:20.000 --> 33:49.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:50.000 --> 33:52.000]  We have this delusion.
[33:52.000 --> 33:58.000]  This guy says he's like a big shot or something, like the Communist Chinese care about you.
[33:58.000 --> 34:04.000]  We had the Communist Chinese three years ago directly threaten Paul Watson in person in London,
[34:04.000 --> 34:10.000]  and he doesn't like me to talk about it because it was traumatic, okay?
[34:10.000 --> 34:13.000]  The Communist Chinese have taken the world over.
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  They got 98% of rare earth minerals.
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  Have you seen the President attack me by name?
[34:17.000 --> 34:20.000]  Have you seen Hillary attack me and call me Darkheart?
[34:20.000 --> 34:25.000]  You think Hillary calls people a Darkheart and they don't get messed with?
[34:25.000 --> 34:32.000]  You think I got former Blackwater people as my security because I want to pay for that?
[34:32.000 --> 34:38.000]  I'm Mr. Fearless that's going out and giving speeches for decades with no security.
[34:38.000 --> 34:40.000]  We're changing the world.
[34:40.000 --> 34:47.000]  24 Wars got 85 million video views and radio listens for more than 15 minutes per...
[34:47.000 --> 34:49.000]  That's true listeners the week of the election.
[34:49.000 --> 34:52.000]  The new floor is 41 million.
[34:52.000 --> 34:53.000]  I'm not bragging.
[34:53.000 --> 34:58.000]  We're in a dangerous situation running a major attack against the foreign globalist
[34:58.000 --> 35:00.000]  taking over this country who want to make you poor.
[35:00.000 --> 35:03.000]  So I want to tell the snot-nosed kids something out there,
[35:03.000 --> 35:06.000]  living in their mother's basement at 25.
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  They want you to live in your mother's basement.
[35:08.000 --> 35:11.000]  They don't want you to go out and get a woman and be a man and be successful.
[35:11.000 --> 35:16.000]  And they teach you how it's cool to sit around and laugh at real stuff and laugh at real men
[35:16.000 --> 35:19.000]  busting their butts to try to outlive in a free society.
[35:19.000 --> 35:22.000]  Is that clear?
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.000]  Now, we have one of the top companies.
[35:25.000 --> 35:32.000]  It's a household name in the country that supplies stuff for Google, Walmart, you name it.
[35:32.000 --> 35:34.000]  And we've had their presidents on the line.
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.000]  They say they've never seen an attack like we've had the last three days.
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.000]  They find it interesting. It's like a big game to them.
[35:41.000 --> 35:46.000]  They kept flipping switches on cloud systems to hundreds and thousands then of servers
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.000]  to finally stop the level of attack.
[35:48.000 --> 35:53.000]  Massive state run.
[35:53.000 --> 35:59.000]  They had to flip servers to the level that Visa and MasterCard have nationwide to stay up.
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  We're on the same system as Visa and MasterCard.
[36:01.000 --> 36:02.000]  That's what it took.
[36:02.000 --> 36:05.000]  Visa and MasterCard power. Boom!
[36:05.000 --> 36:06.000]  To stop it.
[36:06.000 --> 36:09.000]  The entire frickin' dark army of China.
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  Going, nah, they knocked us out.
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  Because I'm on air pointing out that they're in the news and no one even cares.
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  Oh, look, honey, it says in the Wall Street Journal,
[36:18.000 --> 36:23.000]  the Communist Chinese are helping run this and are advising our government on censorship.
[36:23.000 --> 36:26.000]  What? What? What?
[36:26.000 --> 36:28.000]  And then I see articles on what you don't like Chinese people.
[36:28.000 --> 36:29.000]  You know what?
[36:29.000 --> 36:33.000]  The next piece of garbage says that. I'm gonna punch them in the nose metaphorically.
[36:33.000 --> 36:36.000]  I don't have to play race card. My sister's Korean adopted.
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.000]  I was brought up to be colorblind.
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.000]  It's the Chinese that are super racist towards outsiders,
[36:41.000 --> 36:44.000]  including the Japanese half the time and vice versa.
[36:44.000 --> 36:45.000]  And I love everybody.
[36:45.000 --> 36:49.000]  The point is stop thinking tribalism only goes on with white people.
[36:49.000 --> 36:52.000]  We're the folks that tried to stop it and end it.
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.000]  Doesn't mean we don't have problems either.
[36:55.000 --> 36:59.000]  But I'm sick of the ignorance and I'm tired of it.
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.000]  The Communist Chinese have killed over 100 million of their own people,
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  84 million under Mao.
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  They have suicide nets around thousands of factories.
[37:07.000 --> 37:10.000]  They work women and children 16, 18 hours a day.
[37:10.000 --> 37:14.000]  The left doesn't care about new footage of little kids working in slave labor,
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  sometimes to death in North Korea.
[37:16.000 --> 37:18.000]  I'm gonna play that later, by the way. I forgot to tell you about that.
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  It's all over the news. I was telling the crew to get it.
[37:20.000 --> 37:24.000]  The left's like, oh, good. It's a communist utopia.
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.000]  But don't let homeschooler kids carry the trash out of its forced labor.
[37:28.000 --> 37:31.000]  They want to handicap you. They want to control you.
[37:31.000 --> 37:33.000]  They want to dominate you.
[37:33.000 --> 37:38.000]  So, the amount of money I've got to spend and the amount of money we lose
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  having our shopping cart shut down for two days,
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  I want everyone to go to infowarstore.com.
[37:42.000 --> 37:45.000]  By the way, no one ever got in as a hack-wise.
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.000]  It was DDoS attacks and a bunch of others they don't want me to get into.
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  Some stuff they've never seen before.
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.000]  Purely synthetic bandwidth.
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  Not even real stuff. They were like, what the hell is this?
[37:54.000 --> 37:57.000]  They had the FBI was running around trying to figure out
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.000]  stuff they've never seen, okay?
[37:59.000 --> 38:02.000]  Now, oh yeah, China's now using weapons we've not seen yet.
[38:02.000 --> 38:03.000]  Okay, on us.
[38:03.000 --> 38:06.000]  Well, of course they are. They know the president listens.
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.000]  They know I talked to the president. They're all crapping their britches.
[38:09.000 --> 38:10.000]  They know General Flynn's a listener.
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  You think only General Flynn's a listener?
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  You think you kicked General Flynn out?
[38:14.000 --> 38:17.000]  The next one will come in even more hardcore.
[38:17.000 --> 38:21.000]  There's finally a voice, finally someone on air that understands the attack plan.
[38:21.000 --> 38:24.000]  I'm willing to take them on and I've got the backing and support
[38:24.000 --> 38:28.000]  and the stinking Kami Chinese can't stand it.
[38:28.000 --> 38:33.000]  Because I get historians on who expose how the CIA put them in power in 49
[38:33.000 --> 38:36.000]  and how the Rockefeller set up a deal in the 70s with them to leverage out
[38:36.000 --> 38:39.000]  and the secret global treaty that's now being leaked.
[38:39.000 --> 38:42.000]  And they're not going to get to Panama Canal anymore.
[38:42.000 --> 38:45.000]  And they're not going to get one-sided deals in 98% of rare earth minerals.
[38:45.000 --> 38:48.000]  They're not going to get to have 15% lower corporate taxes so we don't have any jobs.
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.000]  We're going to equalize that. And they're freaking out.
[38:51.000 --> 38:54.000]  And they go, who's doing this? And they go, Alex Jones.
[38:54.000 --> 38:57.000]  And they're like, take him out.
[38:57.000 --> 39:02.000]  Let me go over some headlines for radio and TV viewers just to break this down for you.
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  Communist China moves to shut down infowars.com.
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.000]  Fake news censorship originated in China.
[39:07.000 --> 39:10.000]  Document cam please. That is on infowars.com.
[39:10.000 --> 39:13.000]  My report from earlier today when I wasn't so angry. Okay?
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  I'm going to give you a document cam and I'm going to show a bunch of articles.
[39:15.000 --> 39:20.000]  Okay? Here's the next one. Angela Merkel caught on hot mic confronting Mark Zuckerberg
[39:20.000 --> 39:24.000]  over racist Facebook posts. That means criticizing socialists or open borders.
[39:24.000 --> 39:29.000]  That's Bloomberg pushing it, spinning it. He promises to censorship. Don't worry.
[39:29.000 --> 39:33.000]  Okay? Here's another one. This is Forbes.
[39:33.000 --> 39:38.000]  Doing business in China. Doing business in Chinese way.
[39:38.000 --> 39:42.000]  Facebook develops a censorship tool working with the common Chinese Forbes.
[39:42.000 --> 39:45.000]  Here's another one. Mark Zuckerberg caught on hot mics. What I told you about.
[39:45.000 --> 39:50.000]  German politicians want 500 euro fines over Facebook fake news.
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.000]  Zuckerberg lauds socialism while China's internet censorship czar.
[39:54.000 --> 39:57.000]  Meets with them 14 times to align the program of censorship.
[39:57.000 --> 40:01.000]  Wall Street Journal. Fake news is rampant, even under tight Chinese filters.
[40:01.000 --> 40:06.000]  We don't hear about China filtering anymore. That's not an issue. We're China censoring.
[40:06.000 --> 40:11.000]  No, no. Now they're doing their job and our media is like, darn, we wish those Chinese could do a better job
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.000]  than censoring their evil people. See how they flipped it by labeling.
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.000]  Tripling your healthcare costs is now affordable. Is now free.
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.000]  Every, you didn't build your business. Your mother and father didn't raise you.
[40:24.000 --> 40:29.000]  The state is. They're just telling you this. It's not China intensifies censorship but fails.
[40:29.000 --> 40:35.000]  It's, China can't even shut down these fake news people.
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.000]  The New York Times says, what happens when a country cracks down on fake news?
[40:39.000 --> 40:45.000]  Ask China. That's the PC world. Oh, and they say, oh, yeah, China was the first to do it.
[40:45.000 --> 40:50.000]  And oh, they're the model of it just like I told you.
[40:50.000 --> 40:55.000]  It says one country feels vindicated. They've been proven right.
[40:55.000 --> 41:01.000]  Now that America is going to censor like China, the Chinese Politburo and Central Committee,
[41:01.000 --> 41:07.000]  it actually says it is vindicated. And you go see every major movie about science and technology.
[41:07.000 --> 41:12.000]  And it's China that saves the day. And it'll show the Politburo in red flags.
[41:12.000 --> 41:16.000]  Our people see that go, what is that? That's showing their capital saving America,
[41:16.000 --> 41:20.000]  their government saving us because we're idiots in every major movie that comes out now
[41:20.000 --> 41:24.000]  from the Martian to Arrival to you name it.
[41:24.000 --> 41:28.000]  It'll be the Politburo going, they'll go, president, the Americans are incompetent.
[41:28.000 --> 41:31.000]  It'll save them. And then they'll save us.
[41:31.000 --> 41:37.000]  Every major movie now. All propaganda, buying up the six Hollywood firms.
[41:37.000 --> 41:43.000]  Listen to this article. The current debate over fake online news has one country feeling vindicated.
[41:43.000 --> 41:49.000]  Oh, oh, not our government now has collapsed to China. China is taking over and following orders from them.
[41:49.000 --> 41:53.000]  Massive censorship. Major tech giants are now capitulating to China in a green and global censorship.
[41:53.000 --> 41:56.000]  China lectures Americans in Wall Street Journal to shut down alt-right.
[41:56.000 --> 42:00.000]  Total emergency. Our governments linking up with the red Chinese help censor Americans.
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.000]  Unbelievable using the Chinese Black Dark Army to censor websites.
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.000]  Oh my God, now the NSA is teamed up with China to censor the patriot movement.
[42:07.000 --> 42:11.000]  Donald Trump's had to put all this stuff in himself, by the way, because he's under daily attack.
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.000]  No, no, none of that. Americans unite. Americans come together. No, no, no, no, no.
[42:15.000 --> 42:24.000]  It's all, thank God that Chinese are vindicated and can help us shut down that pesky Alex Jones that hadn't killed one person.
[42:24.000 --> 42:28.000]  But it's all how violent and bad I am because I won't roll over.
[42:28.000 --> 42:33.000]  The current debate, this is PC World. Oh, the current debate over fake online news has one country's feeling vindicated.
[42:33.000 --> 42:40.000]  China, for years, its controversial censorship system, where they kill people for speech, has been cracking down on so-called online rumors.
[42:40.000 --> 42:44.000]  And last week, a state-controlled newspaper essentially told the US, I told you so.
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. In fact, that's the article. I'm trying to find that one. I couldn't.
[42:47.000 --> 42:50.000]  It was all over our news at the time where they said, I told you so, you better do more.
[42:50.000 --> 42:57.000]  And then it just goes on. Oh, will we adopt killing people for their speech too? It's so progressive.
[42:57.000 --> 43:02.000]  Well, what do we have here? Fake news or fake birth certificate?
[43:02.000 --> 43:14.000]  In an hour-long press conference on December 15, 2016, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio concluded a five-year investigation into the document that was President Barack Hussein Obama's birth certificate.
[43:14.000 --> 43:17.000]  The conclusion? Fake, fake, fake.
[43:17.000 --> 43:30.000]  Sheriff Arpaio and Mike Zulo broke down the nine points of forgery on Barack Obama's fake birth certificate, showed the source document, Johanna Anise birth certificate, had the findings confirmed by two different forensics investigators,
[43:30.000 --> 43:35.000]  all the while making it very clear they wished they hadn't come to this epic conclusion.
[43:35.000 --> 43:40.000]  But they determined it was fake, and Sheriff Arpaio has now handed over this investigation to the federal government.
[43:40.000 --> 43:50.000]  Think about all the implications here. Eight years of a fraudulent president, all the executive orders, the healthcare bill, the wars, all the lies, lies, lies, lies.
[43:50.000 --> 44:19.000]  What will Obama's response be? If that is his real name, this is Owen Schreuer, and Infowars is the tip of the spear.
[44:19.000 --> 44:31.000]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.

[45:18.000 --> 45:24.000]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.

[46:20.000 --> 46:23.000]  The thyroid gland, it helps detoxify.
[46:23.000 --> 46:26.000]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[46:26.000 --> 46:42.000]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body. As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[46:42.000 --> 46:51.000]  I'm taking it now every day. This is so key. Biotru selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you. We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.

[47:01.000 --> 47:13.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:13.000 --> 47:16.000]  Yeah, the children out there.
[47:16.000 --> 47:30.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[47:30.000 --> 47:35.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:35.000 --> 47:45.000]  Michael Bloomberg and George Soros, two basically tax-exempt, loveless kingpins who are anti-American, spend all their time trying to overthrow our bill of rights, have given billions of dollars to overturn our elections.
[47:45.000 --> 47:51.000]  They now have their every-town initiative where they gave millions and millions of dollars to defeat Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
[47:51.000 --> 48:00.000]  He's coming up in the next hour joining us to talk about that, to talk about the Obama birth certificate, which was fake on purpose.
[48:00.000 --> 48:06.000]  And we're going to go over all that. That's why Michelle said he was from Kenyon, speeches up until 2007.
[48:06.000 --> 48:14.000]  It's why in the Harvard Law Review that he edited for three years as an editor, he said in the intro, I am born in Kenyon.
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.000]  My father is Kenyon. That was his cover. That guy looked nothing like him.
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  We just knew he said he was born in Kenyon, and his birth certificate was fake.
[48:22.000 --> 48:29.000]  It was all a cover from his dad, Frank Marshall Davis. But the point is, we don't know his real identity.
[48:29.000 --> 48:33.000]  That's why he has five different aliases.
[48:33.000 --> 48:39.000]  I mean, this guy is unbelievable. We know his mother and grandfather were CIA.
[48:39.000 --> 48:49.000]  I mean, her father probably was the CIA section chief there in Hawaii, but it just gets crazier from there, folks.
[48:49.000 --> 48:57.000]  This is totally crazy. But they now had top forensics labs after a multi-year study come out and conclusively prove that the birth certificate they released is totally fake.
[48:57.000 --> 49:05.000]  Hell, they left it in layers on purpose, so we know that. But we now have it certified.
[49:05.000 --> 49:11.000]  And a lot of these labs obviously were scared to have this released until Obama was about to be out of office because this is bombshell.
[49:11.000 --> 49:16.000]  And I thought people wouldn't care, but I said, okay, have our pile on, do a special live report.
[49:16.000 --> 49:22.000]  Thursday on it, it had like a million views on our two YouTube and Facebook channels.
[49:22.000 --> 49:27.000]  And then a derivative of it had like 300,000 views, and I thought people were sick of the whole birth certificate.
[49:27.000 --> 49:39.000]  I'd love to have our pile on just about being targeted by Soros and by Bloomberg, his last two elections, and they finally won, probably with a lot of hanky-panky evidence was showing.
[49:39.000 --> 49:43.000]  But they tried fraud against Trump, but his tsunami was so big they failed.
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.000]  So our pile is coming up also one of his detectives.
[49:46.000 --> 49:54.000]  So a separate detective we've had on before from a separate jurisdiction that also helped launch the investigation a few years ago.
[49:54.000 --> 50:00.000]  But before we go any further, if you're a new listener, I just read to you from the BBC.
[50:00.000 --> 50:03.000]  I just read to you from PC World.
[50:03.000 --> 50:07.000]  I just read to you where they're like, oh, it's wonderful.
[50:07.000 --> 50:12.000]  China's been proven right with its so-called censorship, stopping fake news.
[50:12.000 --> 50:17.000]  That means arresting people and executing them.
[50:17.000 --> 50:25.000]  They've arrested tech writers for major papers in China who criticize the stock when it goes down and they kill you.
[50:25.000 --> 50:28.000]  Talk about crazy land.
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  So we're now under censorship.
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  Now look at this BBC article.
[50:32.000 --> 50:35.000]  China's social credit Beijing sets up huge system.
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  This was last year.
[50:37.000 --> 50:38.000]  We covered it.
[50:38.000 --> 50:39.000]  Drudge covered it.
[50:39.000 --> 50:44.000]  And we said, watch, they're going to bring this social credit system here where the government corporations can lower your score.
[50:44.000 --> 50:48.000]  From a 5-0 to a 4.9 and write down.
[50:48.000 --> 50:51.000]  And once it hits a 2.5, mortgages are more.
[50:51.000 --> 50:52.000]  Everything's more.
[50:52.000 --> 50:57.000]  It's a social control system right out of a science fiction dystopia movie, The Mark of the Beast.
[50:57.000 --> 51:02.000]  And this is their control system, which they're now pushing here in the United States.
[51:02.000 --> 51:03.000]  Now here's an example.
[51:03.000 --> 51:06.000]  We're partnered with YouTube because we have billions of views.
[51:06.000 --> 51:07.000]  I didn't do it for years.
[51:07.000 --> 51:08.000]  They approached us.
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  One of their vice presidents did three years ago.
[51:10.000 --> 51:16.000]  And they said it'll no longer be bots that strike you for copyright and stuff.
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  It'll be real humans you're working with.
[51:18.000 --> 51:19.000]  I said, good.
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.000]  We've had no real problem since then.
[51:21.000 --> 51:22.000]  We're a trusted company.
[51:22.000 --> 51:27.000]  We have good material, good news, no lawsuits, no issues, no copyright stuff.
[51:27.000 --> 51:30.000]  We are partnered with YouTube and Google.
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  And I know Google's big and globalist.
[51:32.000 --> 51:33.000]  It's been the least bad of the others.
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  They're now getting on board the censorship.
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  We probably won't be there very long.
[51:37.000 --> 51:41.000]  But the point is, is that while we've been there, we've reached billions of people.
[51:41.000 --> 51:45.000]  And we're going to fight to stay there because they operate as it's an open commons.
[51:45.000 --> 51:46.000]  Follow the rules.
[51:46.000 --> 51:47.000]  Then you'll be here.
[51:47.000 --> 51:48.000]  Well, we have.
[51:48.000 --> 51:51.000]  This is tilting the rules to say, you know what?
[51:51.000 --> 51:52.000]  Doesn't matter.
[51:52.000 --> 51:53.000]  You've got a long history.
[51:53.000 --> 51:54.000]  Doesn't matter.
[51:54.000 --> 51:55.000]  You've done all this great work.
[51:55.000 --> 51:56.000]  Doesn't matter.
[51:56.000 --> 51:57.000]  You reach billions of people.
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  We're going to have a group funded by Soros.
[51:59.000 --> 52:00.000]  Say you're fake.
[52:00.000 --> 52:05.000]  And so you're going to be banned or you're going to be restricted or when somebody tries to
[52:05.000 --> 52:09.000]  visit your website, it's going to have a message that pops up in the browser saying, don't go
[52:09.000 --> 52:10.000]  here.
[52:10.000 --> 52:11.000]  It's dangerous.
[52:11.000 --> 52:12.000]  That's already happening on Google Chrome.
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  Until I told Google, I'm filing lawsuit.
[52:14.000 --> 52:15.000]  They took it down the next day.
[52:15.000 --> 52:20.000]  They're probing to see what we'll put up with.
[52:20.000 --> 52:24.000]  Reddit is not stopping the deep bearing of our links, violating the terms of service.
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  Even their own users do it.
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.000]  So I don't want to go into the lawyers.
[52:28.000 --> 52:29.000]  I don't want to have to do it.
[52:29.000 --> 52:33.000]  But I'm figuring out who I'm going to sue right now for violating all of our rights.
[52:33.000 --> 52:36.000]  The Communist Chinese, they don't follow copyright, nothing.
[52:36.000 --> 52:37.000]  They don't follow any laws.
[52:37.000 --> 52:38.000]  They steal intellectual property.
[52:38.000 --> 52:39.000]  It's well-known.
[52:39.000 --> 52:42.000]  But Obama doesn't have a problem with them.
[52:42.000 --> 52:46.000]  He's trying to bully the Russians because they're not as strong as the Chinese.
[52:46.000 --> 52:52.000]  But the real sadness of PC world and others going, boy, China's been proven right on censorship.
[52:52.000 --> 52:56.000]  Or I'm sorry, so-called censorship, shut down fake news.
[52:56.000 --> 52:57.000]  That's a good thing.
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  And now we're going to follow what they say.
[52:59.000 --> 53:00.000]  Thank God.
[53:00.000 --> 53:06.000]  China's crackdown on online rumors a few years ago was harshly condemned by the West, wrote the Global Times.
[53:06.000 --> 53:11.000]  Things changed really quickly as the anxiety over internet management has been transferred to the U.S.
[53:11.000 --> 53:18.000]  Yeah, the ruling corrupt elite, like the ruling corrupt elite in China that wants to stay in power, is getting kicked out of power.
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  So now you want to censor things.
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  That's the giant elephant in the room.
[53:22.000 --> 53:24.000]  That's the incredible bombshell.
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  Not my opinion.
[53:26.000 --> 53:31.000]  Our government, illegitimate, is trying to overturn the election of Trump right now.
[53:31.000 --> 53:35.000]  Is trying to say ban Trump, trying to ban Alex Jones, ban Drudge.
[53:35.000 --> 53:39.000]  Because we're kicking the living daylights out of them with truth.
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  They're all over the news saying, I'm violent.
[53:41.000 --> 53:47.000]  I'm going to cause violence while George Soros gives billions to insurrection groups that call for killing police officers.
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  The government is rogue.
[53:49.000 --> 53:51.000]  It's completely out of control.
[53:51.000 --> 53:54.000]  There's an attempt with patriots in the government.
[53:54.000 --> 53:57.000]  Not somebody to worship government, but here I am being proven wrong.
[53:57.000 --> 54:04.000]  It's the patriots in government that recognize what's happening that are trying to countermand this and trying to block this right now.
[54:04.000 --> 54:07.000]  There is a war over the heart of this country and our future.
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  That's not rhetoric, people.
[54:09.000 --> 54:13.000]  If massive history was staring you in the face, would you recognize it?
[54:13.000 --> 54:14.000]  It's happening now.
[54:14.000 --> 54:15.000]  Look at this.
[54:15.000 --> 54:19.000]  The Wall Street Journal, the BBC, all of them praising it.
[54:19.000 --> 54:23.000]  To Forbes's credit, they're not praising Chinese net censorship.
[54:23.000 --> 54:30.000]  Coming to America, actually being haunchowed by the Communist Chinese.
[54:30.000 --> 54:35.000]  Being driven, being run, being captained, being commanded, being advised, being consulted.
[54:35.000 --> 54:36.000]  It's sensational.
[54:36.000 --> 54:44.000]  The People's Daily, two weeks ago, that they just mentioned, was in the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the AP was everywhere.
[54:44.000 --> 54:50.000]  Lecturing us on how to shut down fake news and bragging that they were helping Facebook, Google and Twitter do it.
[54:50.000 --> 54:56.000]  And you see the purge on Twitter, the purge on Reddit, the purge everywhere with the EU waiting in.
[54:56.000 --> 55:02.000]  The high court saying, you have one day to tell us how you're going to start censoring.
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  And a day later, the censorship started.
[55:04.000 --> 55:08.000]  And then armies of bots running around saying, Alex is lying.
[55:08.000 --> 55:09.000]  There is no censorship.
[55:09.000 --> 55:10.000]  He's not important.
[55:10.000 --> 55:13.000]  The Communist Chinese wouldn't hit him.
[55:13.000 --> 55:16.000]  I'm talking to the top IT people that handle our stuff.
[55:16.000 --> 55:21.000]  And they're saying, we really don't want you to play out with the attack, sorry, but if you really want, we'll certify a report.
[55:21.000 --> 55:26.000]  I've got the report right here, exactly how they did it, where it came from, everything.
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  And I'm looking at publishing it tomorrow.
[55:28.000 --> 55:29.000]  I'm looking at it.
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  I got to talk to them after this broadcast.
[55:31.000 --> 55:32.000]  I was up at two in the morning on this.
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  I was up at 6 a.m. on this.
[55:34.000 --> 55:35.000]  I've been up on this constantly.
[55:35.000 --> 55:41.000]  They've never seen an attack this big, ever.
[55:41.000 --> 55:42.000]  And I'm on the phone.
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  Do you want to go to 100 cloud systems?
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  Yeah, 100 cloud systems.
[55:46.000 --> 55:47.000]  They're knocking it down.
[55:47.000 --> 55:50.000]  You want to go to 1,000?
[55:50.000 --> 55:56.000]  You now have more than the major credit card companies.
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  And then they told me stuff that's in confidence.
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  And I'm not allowed to tell you.
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  Let's just say the FBI is involved.
[56:02.000 --> 56:05.000]  And let's just say the president knows about it.
[56:05.000 --> 56:06.000]  President-elect.
[56:06.000 --> 56:11.000]  Because there's only one other person been hit by something this big.
[56:11.000 --> 56:14.000]  I guess I'm kind of telling you that it wasn't in total confidence.
[56:14.000 --> 56:15.000]  It's some of this.
[56:15.000 --> 56:16.000]  I can't tell people.
[56:16.000 --> 56:17.000]  It's too incredible.
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  Do you think they're hitting me hard?
[56:19.000 --> 56:20.000]  Imagine how they're hitting Trump.
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  And I'm talking about White House.gov.
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  I'm talking about his new Make America Great Again.gov.
[56:24.000 --> 56:27.000]  I'm talking about DonaldJTrump.com.
[56:27.000 --> 56:32.000]  It's the only other place getting hit with this new stuff that isn't even,
[56:32.000 --> 56:33.000]  it's synthetic bandwidth.
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  It's not even real request.
[56:35.000 --> 56:40.000]  And it's coming right out of the commie Chinese.
[56:40.000 --> 56:45.000]  Just because we want fair taxes and a level playing field with you.
[56:45.000 --> 56:46.000]  Oh, that's incredible.
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  So what I'm asking listeners to do is I'm going to be able to announce tomorrow
[56:48.000 --> 56:51.000]  that despite the fact that they made us lose the amount that would take me to hire
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  another employee, which I'm planning to do just in the last three days.
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  This is our key part of the year.
[56:55.000 --> 56:56.000]  We're going to the black.
[56:56.000 --> 56:57.000]  Free shipping.
[56:57.000 --> 56:58.000]  I'm extending it through the route.
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  The rest of the week was going to end tomorrow.
[57:00.000 --> 57:01.000]  Store-wide, 50% off.
[57:01.000 --> 57:02.000]  Coitle silver.
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  A bunch of other items with 30% off.
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  And I'm going to keep it all up there until everything sells out.
[57:06.000 --> 57:09.000]  Plus, it's a great way year in to sell out of everything.
[57:09.000 --> 57:11.000]  We have inventory taxes to pay.
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  Infowarslife.com.
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  Infowarsstore.com is the big umbrella site.
[57:15.000 --> 57:18.000]  Again, when you go there, it waits about 10 seconds.
[57:18.000 --> 57:19.000]  They never got into the site itself.
[57:19.000 --> 57:21.000]  It's totally secure, highest security level.
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.000]  They have to black hole all these IPs and redirect all this stuff
[57:24.000 --> 57:27.000]  and check you before you go in.
[57:27.000 --> 57:29.000]  And so that's why you sit there five seconds before you go in.
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  We have a backup site as well.
[57:31.000 --> 57:34.000]  So just support us, get the products.
[57:34.000 --> 57:38.000]  And I want to announce here that we've made double what we lost in the next few days
[57:38.000 --> 57:41.000]  as a victory against the murdering communist Chinese
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  and a victory for America.
[57:43.000 --> 57:47.000]  And the fact that we will awaken the sleeping giant as modern Paul Revere.
[57:47.000 --> 57:48.000]  Stay with us.
[57:48.000 --> 57:49.000]  You developed living defense for us.
[57:49.000 --> 57:51.000]  It took you over a year to do it.
[57:51.000 --> 57:52.000]  Why is this so good?
[57:52.000 --> 57:57.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[57:57.000 --> 58:02.000]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[58:02.000 --> 58:06.000]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites,
[58:06.000 --> 58:11.000]  which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now
[58:11.000 --> 58:14.000]  with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[58:14.000 --> 58:17.000]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[58:17.000 --> 58:18.000]  These are all parasites.
[58:18.000 --> 58:21.000]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[58:21.000 --> 58:22.000]  You have the neem in there.
[58:22.000 --> 58:25.000]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[58:25.000 --> 58:28.000]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[58:28.000 --> 58:29.000]  All right.
[58:29.000 --> 58:32.000]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[58:32.000 --> 58:33.000]  It just came back in yesterday.
[58:33.000 --> 58:36.000]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com, and folks, you can't lose.
[58:36.000 --> 58:38.000]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[58:38.000 --> 58:42.000]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.

[59:48.000 --> 01:00:11.000]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:19.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000]  All right, Sheriff Arpaio's joining us, one of the longest serving.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  I was highly-decorated sheriff in the history of the Phoenix area.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  Of course, got demonized internationally, the UN came after him.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  You name it, George Soros, Bloomberg, they finally got him out of office,
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  but he's coming on about their years of research into the birth certificate,
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  down-conclusive with outside top forensic labs that it's a fake as a $3 bill.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  So that's coming up, and we'll also look at the attacks on free speech happening nationwide.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  One of the retired Bergen County New Jersey detective, Mike Zulow,
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  who's been in studio with us, also has been leading this up for the sheriff
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  in his cold case, Posse.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  So that is coming out in the next segment, hearing about five minutes.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  But I want to be clear, I just read to you out of PC World and others
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  where they have the people's daily saying, we're censoring America.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  America's adopting our censorship model, and our media is saying it's good
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  to censor the conservative and libertarian press by having a George Soros run group.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  Again, in fact, you guys print me the daily call or others where it points out
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  that Soros funded group now, you know, now runs the control of the news.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  This is so unprecedented. This is an authoritarian takeover.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  The problem is Trump's about to get in.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  That's why they've got all these electors being visited at their houses,
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  thousands of letters. You've got media everywhere telling electors who are Republican.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  Tomorrow, don't vote in the Electoral College. It's the 19th.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  We don't find out what really happened, though, supposedly, until the 6th of January.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  We may learn earlier, but according to law, it's the 6th.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  So they're openly trying to overthrow the election right now.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  On every front, Americans aren't used to true totalitarianism.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  And now the censorship of the press is hitting, attempts to overthrow elections are hitting,
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  and they're trying to fund groups to go out and kill police officers.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  I mean, I've got the new Black Panther Party and Black Panther affiliated groups
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  and Soros funded socialists and communist groups in Black Lives Matter in Austin
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  at multiple rallies saying, what's better than four dead cops, five dead cops, kill the cops?
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  Again, for total destabilization and the UN run strong cities initiative.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  I mean, this is mainstream news. Loretto Lynch says it's the UN advising them.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  This is a takeover with the communist Chinese in the newspapers
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  telling our government, hurry up and censor Alex Jones.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  So let's play a clip where Saturday Night Live makes a joke out of all this
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  and pretends that they go to people's houses and try to go to an elector's house,
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  try to get them to turn against the popular vote in their states. Here it is.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  I got it. Ding Dong. I'm narrating this for radio.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  Lady, with her husband, goes the door.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  Oh, hi. Who is it?
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  It's a lady dressed like Hillary, Hillary impersonator.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  Say it's Carol Singers. Carol Singers.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  Give them a dollar and tell them to get lost.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  Say it's Carol Singers.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  It's one of the electors. It's me, Hillary Rodden Clinton.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  They make overthrowing the election funny. It's the 70s.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  And she goes on to say, just say,
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  because it's Christmas and at Christmas you tell the truth.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  I know you're an elector.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  And on December 19th, that's tomorrow, you're supposed to vote for Donald Trump.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  But bish. Eat your eye. I don't understand this.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  Funny. He's refusing security briefings. He's already a bunch of lies.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  And so it's all this demonization, all this BS.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  Listen. I know I lost the election and may never know why.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  Koff. Russia. Koff.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  But I still care about this country. Oh, Hillary cares so much.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  You don't even have to vote for me. I'm cool.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  Just vote, literally. Anybody else? Like John Casey.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  Tom Hanks. All right, folks, we're going to go to break.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  This is the sickening evil. And the real propaganda is now on Saturday Night Live.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  Comedy Central, you name it. They've been caught in the WikiLeaks.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life Prostigar.

[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  Not only to tell folks who he is, everybody knows who he is, joins us via phone.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  And Mike Zulo, a retired Bergen County New Jersey detective who has been here in the studio,
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  this great guy, is the chief investigator on the cold case posse
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000]  formed by Sheriff Joe Opaio in Maricopa County, Arizona.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  And he didn't have to do this because obviously,
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  Soros and the usual suspects target you because they ran Obama.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  But Sheriff Joe Opaio and Mike Zulo did it.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  And they had the UN come after them, lawsuits, you name it.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  Now, years after, they've had top forensics labs come out and say, definitely, it's fake.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  Now, listen, folks, they put it in multiple layers so you know it was fake.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  We learned later. It's good to investigate the birth certificate in my view.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  But they did it just to become this whole honey pot, which is good.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  We covered it from the fact that we believe his dad was really Frank Marshall Davis.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  And we know he has all these weird aliases.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  He converted to Islam. He wears an Islamic ring.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  All of this is real.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  He put in his Harvard law review that he edited as the editor that he was born in Kenya.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  His wife in 2007 in speeches, we played him.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  Shit, hey, my husband was born in Kenya on purpose to then put out the fake birth certificate.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  So they would then get us to basically divert off to that.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  And the fact that his dad was Frank Marshall Davis, the famous communist, would never be discovered.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  Now, that's my educated view on it. But regardless, I'm not putting down Sheriff Joe Opaio and the work he's done,
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  exposing this, Fast and Furious, you name it.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000]  And last week, they did a big press conference that millions watched online.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  I know because over a million watched it just on our platforms here as well.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  Another half million or so watched it just in clips we played.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  So people are still very, very interested in this.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  And Sheriff Joe has done an incredible service doing that of the death threats, you name it.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  And so has Mike Zulo.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  But after we've talked to them for maybe two segments to the bottom of the hour about that,
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  I'd like to ask Sheriff Opaio and Mike what it was like to be under millions and millions of dollars
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  every election cycle of Soros and also Bloomberg Money.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  And I've pulled articles from this year where Bloomberg and Soros brag
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  that they've got a stealth gun control program going to deceive the public.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  So they now admit frontal assaults don't work.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  So they've got a stealth attack to throw people out of office like Sheriff Joe
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  and other defenders of the Constitution.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  They're also targeting the Milwaukee Sheriff right now as well.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  So I want to talk about that strategy to pick off folks that are on the front lines out there
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  like Sheriff Joe Opaio.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  Sheriff Joe, I wish you a great Christmas coming up, my friend.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  Keep up the good work.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  It's very complicated, at least with my background.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  You know, I'm no longer serving sheriff in the history of Maricopa County 24 years.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  You know, the feds started going after me Holder and Obama 30 days after they took office.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  It's still around here after all those years.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  And I was defeated and it doesn't shock me.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  He pumped in 3 million in the last 30 days.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  I talk about Soros and then they came out in federal court when a civil judge,
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  I won't get into him, were appealing his findings on racial profiling
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  that shoved it over to criminal and they announced the day before the election started
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  that they're going to charge me and then two weeks later they said they did charge me for a misdemeanor.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  So you can see there's much politics involved.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  Here come Soros last 30 days during the election pumping in 3 million dollars in the media.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  I can go on and on.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  So it was a little tough race, but you know, the people spoke.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  It's not over yet and I said five years ago, five years ago when the Tea Party, 250 of them came to my office,
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  said you're the elected sheriff, will you please investigate the birth certificate?
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  And I don't think I was crazy.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  I've been a federal guy for 30 years.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  I think I knew the heat I would take, but I had to do it and I did.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  When Mike Zulu, I appointed him to do it because there was no taxpayer money, a posse works for nothing.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  I knew I would get heat on that issue and I did it and took five years.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  I was about to say, people can say whatever they want about you or lie about your mixed stuff up.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  We're all victims of that.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  You have got, you know, I mean, the biggest heart and guts out there.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  It goes with the hell, the intimidation, the attacks, the threats.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  I mean, it would take 10 hours to cover it all.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  They certainly were very upset about your investigation before we get into the actual evidence.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  I mean, just your personal gut view of it.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  Why would he say in his law journal that he edited that he was from Kenya born there?
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  Why would his wife say that in speeches and then act like you were crazy trying to investigate the birth certificate?
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  You know, I don't know, Alex, I got my opinion, but let me say from the beginning, I said I could care less where he is from.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  I stick with that.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  I said we are investigating a forage fraudulent government document.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  I said that from day one.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  I continue to say that and I said from day one show the birth certificate or a microfish and we'll all go home.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  That's never happened.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  Mike Zulu has done a great job, tenacity, and we got some lucky breaks to put the nail in the coffin recently.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  And that's what I went public on and nothing to do with me leaving office because I would have done the same thing if I was reelected.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  Absolutely.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  Well, I mean, you'd have press conferences before and shown what forensic teams, independent groups, has said.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  But then you went further and we could probably bring in the detective here and you guys could just pop in whenever you want.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  It's just a roundtable discussion here in format.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  But you guys had some of the top forensics labs in the country.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  And as the detective points out, a lot of these headed up by liberals who didn't want this to be true and watching your press conference the other day that we covered live.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  It looks really, really conclusive.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  Well, Mike, in answer that, let me just say from the beginning we went across the pond to a country where my mother and father came from.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  It's called Italy.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  It got experts and also Mike worked on a guy from Hawaii as an expert. Maybe Mike can explain the recent revelations on this situation.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  Sure, Mike.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  I mean, let's roll the basics out and come back and more detail in the next segment.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  Hi, Alex.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  Pleasure to be with you today.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  Yeah, we, I think, like the sheriff just said, we put the nail in the coffin with this document, you know, last Thursday.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  We, we have nine points of verified forgery.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  And what we had to do and going back to 2011, 2012, you know, Alex, your video that you did initially on this, you were sitting with a gentleman taking the layers apart.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  That was the very first video I ever saw on the document.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  And it was the only video I saw for a very long time because I didn't want to, you know, pollute myself with taking a lot of information.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  I needed to do this on my own.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  And I did see that video and that video was compelling in and of itself.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  And we confirmed a lot of those things in our first two press conferences.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  And we even went further in the second press conference by introducing Reed Hayes, a document examiner from Hawaii, 40 year career.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  I mean, the man is an instructor, a certified court recognized expert.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  And we put information out backing up what we did then.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  Media went silent.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  They went silent and they just went into attack mode.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  Well, the sheriff and I had been discussing this for quite some time.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  And we agreed that the only way we were going to be able to pursue this was going to be doing it under the radar.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  And that's what we did.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  And as this was unfolding, there are operatives out there that come against this kind of investigation.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  You know, they do it for political motivation.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  Sure. They're trying to put you guys in jail.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  Yeah, I tried. They started to float an idea around about a copy machine being the forger and whatnot.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  And we had to investigate that and I make that clear in the video how we did it.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  But what happened was a turning point and like the sheriff said, a lucky break.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  I knew that we had the evidence the first two times and I knew we still had the evidence.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  The problem you get with this when you're putting together any kind of criminal case, you know, you have to think about conviction.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  It's not just enough putting somebody, you know, in bars and arrest behind bars and arresting them.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  You have to think about how is this going to conclude?
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  And the evidence was compelling the first two times.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  A lot of the evidence is what you had in your video.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  However, I knew that there was so much computer forensics involved that you would never convince a jury.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  There's too much doubt could be thrown in as to how this may have happened other ways.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  Sure, sure, stay there. We're going to come back. We're going to come back on the other side and look at this as if it was going to be a court proceeding.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  Stay with us with Sheriff Jorapio and the detective.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  I want to tell you about a brand new off-the-rib product. It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  Even though it's so small, you can put it in your pocket. It can actually run some 110 appliances at your house.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  Like small refrigerators to keep your food from spoiling.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  The best part, though, you can take it with you.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  It's so mobile to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity,
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  A true innovation. I have never seen anything like this.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  You're going to want to load up on these. One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.

[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  More than two years ago, Info Wars first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.000]  It told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000]  and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today,
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  If you can hear my voice, you are the Resistance.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:13.000]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:19.000]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:36.000]  It works like an antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount. It's in powder form.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  We have so many five-star reviews. I take this. This is the product that I take.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:53.000]  InfoWarsLive.com and the profit we make. We fight the globalists. We fight the New World Order.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:20.000]  InfoWarsLive.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  Now, we're only going to spend one more second on the birth certificate.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.000]  And in the next segment, I want to get into what was it like to be targeted by Soros,
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.000]  who now is going to run, and this is mainstream news,
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  the two groups that tell Google, Facebook, and others what websites we can visit.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.000]  No judge, no jury, communist-style net censorship,
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.000]  actually with the Chinese communist consulting on how to do it.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000]  I have PC World admitting it. The Wall Street Journal.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000]  I mean, this is just so bizarre. I can't even believe it's happening.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000]  But our live coverage of it, it's up on YouTube, was titled,
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.000]  Sheriff Arpaio Proves Obama Birth Certificate Forge.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000]  That's the YouTube version with 184,000 views.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000]  There's about 500,000 views on our Facebook version of that.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  Another 300,000 or so on our own personal feed.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000]  That's why it says about a million views.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  And quite frankly, they were covering this.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000]  I thought, well, it's interesting, but I didn't think people would be that interested.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000]  People are super interested in this still.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.000]  So I'm just very glad that Sheriff Arpaio and others did this because
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  the public asked them to.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.000]  But just encapsulating this,
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000]  the lead detective on the cold case posse, Mike Zulo,
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  who was appointed by Sheriff Arpaio,
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:35.000]  where's the best place for people to go to see the Sheriff's investigation
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000]  for themselves?
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  Well, it's right now, the best place is CarlGalips.com.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:46.000]  He is creating a page that is housing all the information, all the videos,
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:52.000]  because we know that's going to be able to stay up after Sheriff Arpaio leaves office in January.
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  So we don't want it anywhere where they can take it down.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  So CarlGalips.com is where it can be found right now.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  And I also noticed looking at the Sheriff's Department website,
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000]  the Sheriff obviously is, I guess, still on the webpage.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  So he's still the Sheriff.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  Does that transition of power go the same way as the President January 20th?
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  No, sir, January 1st.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000]  January 1st, so we're only talking about, you know, 15 days or 12 days.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  And a lot of research materials on that Sheriff's Department website, isn't there?
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000]  Yes, there is.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000]  Wow, so that's all being transferred again.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000]  What's the website for folks?
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  CarlGalips.com.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000]  CarlGalips.com.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  Okay, we're definitely going to tweak that out.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  That is so important.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:39.000]  Well, Alex, we got one and a half million on my Facebook.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000]  Wow.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  So that was right away when we went public on this.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  So we're getting a lot of reception from people on Facebook.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:55.000]  And I'm going to transfer that into my private Facebook when I leave office.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000]  So it's still going to be around.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  Well, I would imagine you haven't stopped fighting for 55 years in law enforcement.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000]  I don't think you're going to stop now, are you, Sheriff?
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:09.000]  No, and thank God that Donald Trump is elected.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  I was with him from day one in July when I introduced him and had the gut feeling.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  And that day I said he's going to be the next president.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000]  It's coming true.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  I had the gut feeling about two years ago when he first announced it.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  I mean, how soon did you have that gut feeling, Sheriff?
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000]  Well, you know, I've been around.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:37.000]  I'm the campaign honorary manager for Bush and Mitt Romney and Rick Perry.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.000]  So I know something about when people run for president.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000]  But Donald Trump was different.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000]  I caught on to that right away.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:53.000]  A lot of predictions he made is coming true.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  And I admired a man.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  What else can I say?
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  I admired the way he treated my wife who had cancer at the time.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000]  They're calling her.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.000]  So he's a great person and he's going to make a great president.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000]  That's my prediction.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000]  I don't know how he does it because he's so gracious.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  Every cop that gets killed, he calls the widow.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000]  Folks don't know this, but he sends him money.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  I don't know.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.000]  I mean, the word is he spent billions of his fortune just on quiet sharing.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.000]  And then he doesn't want anybody to talk about it.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  Well, I've been with him many times, introducing him.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  I know how he is.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  I flew it in his plane.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  I had a lot of time to talk to him.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000]  He loves cops.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  He loves veterans.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000]  He loves the military.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  He loves the people.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000]  And he's going to shock a lot of people.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  And I'll tell you one thing that burns me up being a top federal guy for 30 years and
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000]  sure for 24.
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  Now they're coming after me from all directions for doing my job.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  So I'm getting a little angry after all this.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  And I'm angry at the media, you know, because they're hiding this thing.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  How can you hide what's going on with this birth certificate?
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  Sir, sir, they take clips of me now.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  And of course it shows video too, but they never show video because it would jump cut.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  You'd see it was edited.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  They have high tech folks that I can't even edit this good.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  Edit stuff I say together that sounds crazy and they put it on even Fox against me now.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  Even Fox is like, I mean, I'm telling you, it's a total attack on this country and they
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  seem to have gotten worse.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  What do you make of them trying to overthrow and threaten the electors to not follow the
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  votes?
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  Well, I was an elector in 2000 with Bush and boy, they tried to go after me trying to get
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  me to switch my vote here in Arizona.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000]  You can do that.
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000]  But, you know, why would I ever do that?
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  Why would anybody do that when they were committed?
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  They're republicans that I'm sure are here in Arizona.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  They're not going to switch.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  And I don't think they are across our nation, but you know, Hillary and that bunch, they
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  can't accept the fees that they got to play every game they can play to try to put garbage
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  in.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  Let me ask this question.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  It seems like things have gotten nastier on their side.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  Like they've just gotten completely insane.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  If you agree with that or disagree, can you elaborate on the psychology, the criminology
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  because they really, I mean, look at the WikiLeaks.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  They act like cartoon villains in those things.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  They're so nasty.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  I can't even believe it.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  But, you know, Sanders and Hillary both went public naturally against me to get me out
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  of office, of course, with all the money from Soros and everything else.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  But I can't forget Sanders.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  Sanders, I took his wife to my tent city.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  She didn't like it.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  And then the husband didn't like it.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000]  And he made some threats on me.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  He said, well, when I become the president, Joe, watch out.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  You're not going to have, I have the power.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  I looked at, of course, my response was he'll never be the president.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  But these people came after me nationally.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  And I think I have, you know, when Soros went after me, I thought it was over the illegal
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  immigration and not legalizing marijuana.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  I think he had a devious motion.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  I got a little information to prove it one day, I will.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  He wanted me out of office because of the birth certificate.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  That's my opinion.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  Of course.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  Well, I mean, you know, they have Comedy Central makes funny even goes.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  He's the guy claims there's severed heads in the desert.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  Doesn't he know there's been thousands of bodies dug up on both sides of the
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000]  border from Texas to Arizona?
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  Well, they don't want to know about it.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  They played an illegal immigration game.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  But, you know, when Trump becomes president, I think things are going to change a little.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  Sure.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  Just over the border of El Paso, they've dug up more than 500 bodies the last couple years.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  Well, we have the third largest county in the country that, you know, I'm the sheriff
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  of and we see the people coming in.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  I predicted a long time ago that the drugs are involved.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  I was the director of Mexico City and I believe in the wall, if it isn't just for
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  illegal immigration, it has to be for the drugs.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  All the drugs coming into our country come from Mexico and Donald Trump played that out
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000]  a year ago.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  Sure, it's not going to stop 100%, but it's going to slow it down.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  I mean, that's why China built a wall.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  It's why the Romans built Hadrian's wall.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  We're going to go to break when I come back, I want to get into the birth certificate,
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  but also where you see this country going, but being briefly, Trump and others had asked
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  Trump to maybe make you the head of Homeland Security or border security.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  You've already served 55 years.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  Obviously, you're still, you know, out there helping.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  But what do you think of this Marine Corps generally put in?
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  I think he'll be pretty good because he worked in the central South America.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  He worked in all those countries too when I was regional director.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  And he believes in putting people in jail.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  And of course, I have all the tents.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  They'll probably take them away, but I put tents up 24 years ago.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  That's my next question.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  What's going to happen when they release these thousands of criminals out of your jail?
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  I mean, I don't need to predict it, a crime explosion.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  Let's talk to the outgoing sheriff, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, straight ahead in his chief deputy
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  on the cold case posse.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.000]  Well, the Russians are hacking our democracy.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  Global warming is an imminent threat to humanity.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000]  Donald Trump, a likely Russian agent, is clearly unfit to be president.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.000]  Now Michelle Obama has said she knows what not having hope feels like.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  You know, now that President Trump is on the horizon.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  Meanwhile, rioting and protesting is all the rave in young Americans, you know, for hope and change.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:23.000]  So with all this on his plate, these trying times for the America that Obama gave hope and change,
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  with his wife and his constituents now feeling hopeless,
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  what is it that President Obama will be doing?
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  Going on vacation!
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  That's right, folks, after eight years of Obama,
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000]  he leaves his people with a disaster and a mess of hopelessness,
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  allegedly all orchestrated by the Russians,
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  and he's skipping town to go on vacation.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.000]  I guess that is the proper response when it comes out your birth certificate is fake.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  Want to get away?
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000]  Obama does.

[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:02.000]  There was a mighty nation, rest above all of creation.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America.
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000]  He's always defended the Second Amendment.
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000]  Let me just read a little thing here from a given point one.
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.000]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:18.000]  Individual rights must pick a back seat to the collective.
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000]  You know what the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.000]  It's gonna be coming after you've done it.
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000]  Oh yeah?
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000]  I take it ain't gonna sit well down my way.
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000]  At all.
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.000]  It's time to ride, boss. We need a thousand paul divers.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.000]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000]  Perich, mom and apple pie.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  And beef was for supper.

[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.000]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white and blue?
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000]  Revelation.
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000]  The movie.info.
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.000]  Let's fix it.
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:15.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:21.000]  Well, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, longest serving sheriff in Maricopa County there in Phoenix.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.000]  Just an invasion zone of drugs and crime and murder.
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:29.000]  The feds have put up signs a third of the way into Arizona saying don't go into these areas.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000]  National parks, you name it.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000]  You know, it's too dangerous.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000]  And the media just says nothing's happening.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:40.000]  I routinely, they'll find a bunch of severed heads and they'll even shoot American citizens down on the Texas-Mexico border.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:46.000]  And then I'll cover it and national news will say, Jones has a new conspiracy theory making up severed heads.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000]  It'll be in the local news.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  I mean, there's 100 plus thousand people killed the last eight years in Mexico on the drug war.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:34:00.000]  So, Sheriff Joe Arpaio and Mike Zulow, former New Jersey detective in Bergen County for several years,
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  heading up the cold case posse on the birth certificate, his phone is a $3 bill.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  And again, it just shows the fraud.
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  I mean, we don't know what's going on exactly.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  The point is, is that he says he's from Kenya, then he wouldn't be eligible.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  And then he looks like he says we're crazy.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  He won't give us a birth certificate for four years.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  When he does, it's fake.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  So, just condensing this Sheriff Arpaio, obviously you're, like you said, a million and a half views on your site,
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000]  on your video, ours has millions.
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.000]  The reason that, again, is exciting is the average CNN show doesn't have a million viewers.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  On our own platforms, we're getting more views than they do.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  So, it sounds to me like folks want to continue to hear what you have to say, Sheriff.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  I think now more than ever.
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  Yeah, I think you were always interested, but because of the media blackout, sometimes the work could not get out.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  And thank you, Alex, and for those others that still get the word out the best way they can.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  When I closed the press conference, I did say one thing.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  I hope we're going to turn over this to Congress.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:10.000]  I hope that some Congress persons will take hold of it, have hearings.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  If they can't hear in the deflated football or steroid, you would think they would have a hearing on this most important subject
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  based in our country and one, probably one of the greatest frauds ever perpetrated in our country.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  So, why not get to the bottom of it and see who's behind this situation?
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  Wow, Sheriff Joe, that is an incredibly good point.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:39.000]  Thinking about this, they have a deflated gate and all this other quite friendly diversionary issues.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  And, you know, President Trump, I get the fact he doesn't want to be vindictive, but Hillary is trying to overthrow his election.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  She's involved in all this stuff. Her foundation's ongoing.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:55.000]  I'm sorry, the President, you know, has to let the Attorney General go after Hillary because it's his duty.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  It's not vindictiveness. Can you speak to that?
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  And, I mean, what, as a former Fed and as someone that's been involved in these prosecutions, involved in all these cases,
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  what would you do if you were the President?
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  Well, I think I would do what he's doing.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  He has a great Attorney General, by the way, to commend that appointment I've met with him a couple of times.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  Just recently, when he was in Phoenix.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.000]  So, he's making some great choices.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  Great choices he's making.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  So, I can't comment.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  I do wish somebody would look into the birth certificate, though, whether it's criminal or taken before Congress
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  and let the people understand what's really going on.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  So, we're going to submit this before I leave office, at least to Congress, and get it out of my hands.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  We did our job for five years. Not much more I can do, but just by chance, luck.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  And the hard work with Mike, we were able to conclude this.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  Sure. Mike, your full press conference is up on share of our bios, Facebook and other sites, stuff on InfoWars as well.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:06.000]  But just in a minute or two, the new developments to the top labs you had, look at this and what they found.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  The certified document examiner for lab is over in Italy. They are digital forensic specialists.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  And what we decided to do here was let the evidence guide us. We weren't guiding the evidence.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  You never guide the evidence in a criminal investigation.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  And what we would do is we were making discoveries in the document.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  And that break we got was when Mark Alar, the gentleman who makes my videos, was making a video for me so I could explain what I was seeing to the sheriff.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:38.000]  And he realized the source certificate, the omnibur certificate, was slightly canted a degree or two off.
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  And once he made this adjustment, this document began to unlock and it started to collapse on its own weight.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:50.000]  And I took those findings, sent them across the world. I sent them to Italy.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  I sent it to Hawaii, two different document examiners.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  I stepped back and I let them both perform analysis on what we have found.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  And both of them, two different disciplines, old school document forensics, new technology digital forensics, came to the same conclusion.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  The document is inauthentic and the things that we have found are not explainable by any other method than cut and paste digital list.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  It's as simple as that.
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  Well, look, I'm no rocket scientist, but we do video editing, not deceiving, but we know about layers, we know about documents.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  When you do a digital document, you have to flatten it and they didn't flatten the document or you wouldn't be able to remove the layers.
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  And I went to forensics people and they said, yeah, that's 101, but they were too scared to come on.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  That's why I'm glad organically you and Sheriff Arpaio were able to go out and do this, but I mean, you see what happened.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:46.000]  Criminal attacks, lawsuits, I mean, they're definitely scared of this, Sheriff.
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  Yeah, I wonder what they're hiding. Maybe they're worried how far up it's going to go, but our whole trust once again was to investigate a forged document and look what's happening today.
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  Why don't you just come up with a microfish, show the original birth certificate and get it over with.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  Oh, absolutely. I mean, notice real ones today are all yellowed because of the acid in the paper and then the one they've got is not yellowed.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  I mean, it goes on and on and on and on and on. I mean, it'd be like if you had a newspaper from the 1960s and it wasn't yellow and it didn't have holes in it.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  You'd know it was been recently printed. I mean, it's how you know it shops when they have, you know, Titanic newspaper, you know, reprinted from the day after the Titanic New York Times.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  It's white paper because it got printed on modern paper. It's white.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  Any newspaper that's old is going to have rod holes in it like Pulp Fiction novels. Everybody knows that.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  Well, Alex, very quickly, you know, we didn't disclose everything again in this press conference. This was an executive summary.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  We have other things in the document. There are a variety of color combinations that should not be in the document.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  I mean, there's a host of stuff. We're not just stopping here and just to add to the sheriff's point, and I'd like you to conclude with the sheriff.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  His whole life story is fascinating. We're not stopping. We are going to do whatever we have to do to put this into the hands of Congress and push for an investigation because, one, it's not mandated.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:18.000]  It's detrimental to this country. We want legislation that this never happens again in this nation.
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  I totally agree. By the way, Sheriff O'Pile is a hard guy to get on. He's so busy. So anytime you'd like to come on and really go over his life, his adventures, you know, as a true lawman,
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  compared to what we're getting today, I would love to have him on. But I got to say this.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  I've been somebody who's more of a libertarian, been critical of some law enforcement and critical of government.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  But I got to say, I've been really surprised the last few years to see law enforcement in the military leading the fight of courage to expose the corruption and really being persecuted for it.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  Because, I mean, it's been the military and police overall that have led the charge against tyranny.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  And I've really been positive to see, you know, just the fact that they can't be intimidated and that they've been there spreading the word about what's happening.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  So that gives me a lot of encouragement. And then I saw Soros and other groups fund hundreds of millions to Black Lives Matter and other groups that are openly calling for the death of police officers.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  It really lets you know how sick these groups are.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  Sheriff, I mean, does it even blow you away that Soros and others have gotten away with doing things? That if I did them, or you did them, we'd be a SWAT team?
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  Well, you're forgetting another element that's called the Department of Justice.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  They're the ones coming into all these cities, including my, and putting monitors to run these police organizations.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  This is a very deep problem we have with this current Department of Justice. I can't say too much about them because they're trying to prosecute me.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  But I never seen anything like this. And I've been around 55 years all over the world. This is unique.
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  And we got to do something about it. And I think the next administration will do something about it.
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  Well, just say it, Sheriff. They act like an outside force. It's like a takeover. It's not America.
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  Yeah. Yeah, led by our own government. That's the problem led by the Department of Justice and their philosophy and the president.
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  I'm not trying to criticize the president.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  Well, it's a fact. I mean, in closing, sir, you'll come back soon. I mean, did you see her press conference about the UN and the strong cities to run the police advisory boards will be run by the UN?
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  Did you see that?
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  Well, that's scary. I didn't see it, but that's very scary.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  It's incredible. Well, we want to commend you, Sheriff, and we want to commend Detective Zulow. Thank you both, gentlemen.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  And, Sheriff, I know you're a busy guy, but in the new year...
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  I'm available, Alex. Call me anytime.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  All right. Thank you. Be safe. Wow. That guy's got a lot of courage. And so does Mike Zulow. I tell you, say what you want about Sheriff or Pyle.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  They've demonized him really bad, but that guy's got a lot of courage. We'll be back with other news. We have a cover. Stay with us.

[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children. The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:20.000]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children. Do the best job you can to purify your air.

[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:27.000]  All right, folks, I'm in the news blitz here in the final segment. I'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central. Lord willing. Massive censorship.
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:36.000]  I've got to get into this. I've got to talk about it.
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  Everybody knows that I'm a Christian, but I am not somebody that sits there and throws stones in glass houses.
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  I don't hate anybody unless they're aggressively out attacking innocent people.
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  That said, it is well known that the whole transsexual movement started in the last 60 years was basically pushed by groups of people that were praying on a lot of folks in many cases to confuse them about their sexuality.
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  A large portion of people that end up getting sex changes end up being very unhappy, very depressed and committing suicide.
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  Any time you go and try to confuse and sexualize children as they're now doing in public schools across the country, it is basically pedophilia.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  I don't care if it's heterosexual, transsexual, homosexual, whatever it is, Facebook with 50 different sexual preferences or identities is just meant to confuse the species.
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  And I have the government documents, the admissions of this.
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  And you see the cover of National Geographic transgender issue, the cover of National Geographic upcoming January issue has sparked outrage online for featuring children questioning their genders and spotlighting what they call a gender revolution.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  And this is the state coming in to confuse your kids when they're naturally discovering things when they're young.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:12.000]  You're not teaching them about sex as you're not supposed to until they hit puberty. The state's coming in and doing it.
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  The article is titled Making a Man, Dangerous Lives of Girls and Rethinking Gender.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  The publication is dedicating their entire first issue of 2017 to the single topic of shifting landscape of gender.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  That's how you kill honeybees, that's how you kill fire ants. You go in, you put chemicals in to confuse the genders.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  This is a weapon system. I put this in my film, Endgame, and in Endgame 2.0.
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  And it shows the government documents in the sixes where they said they'd do this, according to press release.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  And it shows a little boy thinks he's a girl. And he says the best thing about, you know, this is, I don't have to pretend I'm a boy anymore.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  The best thing about being a girl is, now I don't have to pretend I'm a boy.
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  Internet users were quick to share their disappointment over the magazines editorial decision.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  But see, Nat Geo, again, is total social engineering, anti-gon, anti-family, eugenics program.
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:14.000]  And they want to sexualize your children and get in there and get at them for this programming.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  This is an admitted program. China would never allow this. They execute you if you're homosexual.
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  I'm not saying you should do that, because they see it as a destabilization program.
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:28.000]  Castro would put gays in prison. But the left loves them, just like they love Islam.
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  Who won't let you do any of that? Because society's collapsed once you go down this road.
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  Camille Pagli is a lesbian, she'll tell you that. It's a fact.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  Or we're saying society's going to collapse because the lesbians are gay, people know.
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  It always goes to this next. But this time, we've got the government and social engineers pushing it to openly bring us down.
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  They don't want you having kids. They don't want you having families. They want you alone.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  So the state is your father, your mother.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  Now, getting into some of the news that our pile was talking about, here's an article.
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  Report, 82,000 criminal illegals, 84% with felonies, serious misdemeanors to be released.
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:13.000]  That's what Obama's been up to. This is the crime wave of criminals around the world running here.
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  Washington Examiner. I mentioned this article from Slate.
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:22.000]  Whatever happened to Michael Bloomberg's anti-gun crusade, they admit in this article they've gone underground
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:26.000]  and don't admit they want to take the guns, but their plan is to ban guns.
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  I mean, this is so sick how they talk about this like we're stupid and don't see it.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  Then we've got what's China been building in the South China Sea?
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:42.000]  A bunch of rocket and missile bases, including medium-range missiles, to take over the South China Sea, breaking their deal with the globalists.
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:46.000]  Meanwhile, we're told Russia's our enemy.
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  There's a meme going around that shows 50,000 people in an arena for Trump,
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:55.000]  and it says a group of Russian hackers meet to overturn the election.
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.000]  To overturn Hillary.
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:02.000]  France faces its next big test as France's election looms.
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  The average French person in polls says they want to leave the euro.
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:09.000]  They said, quote, we never voted to enter the euro.
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:15.000]  Another AP article, homeless across the country fall victim to synthetic marijuana and wander around like zombies.
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  Yeah, marijuana has a lot of good medical purposes, and I'm for decriminalization,
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:26.000]  but not total legalization and pushing it because I'm in prison for it, nonviolent offenders,
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:30.000]  but the new stuff's so strong, folks, it turns people into zombies.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  Sure, a highly motivated person might use it as who's too high strung, it might help them.
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  But you use this weaponized stuff, you're just going to be like a zombie.
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:41.000]  So that's some of the news on that front.
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:48.000]  Before I get to some of this other news, do you understand that I read six different mainstream news articles
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  that were like, it's great, we used to criticize the Communist Chinese for censorship,
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000]  but now we know it's the right thing to do.
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000]  They coined the term fake news that are going to help us.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000]  BNL shows.
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:05.000]  I mean, the story alone is how our media just labels things now.
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  Like Communist censorship, Communist censorship, what are they doing advising Facebook, Google and Twitter?
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:16.000]  What is Facebook doing a year ago hiring former commanders in the Stasi,
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:19.000]  the most famous secret police to censor Facebook?
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:29.000]  Then we get hit by the biggest denial of service DDoS attack that one of the top internet service companies says
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.000]  they've ever seen with a bunch of other attacks thrown in.
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.000]  Later, by the way, ongoing against info wars, present planet in our shopping cart.

[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  We have Hillary, Obama, the EU, the Communist Chinese saying censor us,
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:02.000]  and they're trying it right now as a test.
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  Separately, CIA meddled in hundreds of elections, Ron Paul on Russia blaming.
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:08.000]  Totally made up.
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:12.000]  They had the Communist Chinese and Saudi Arabians bragging they influenced the election.
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000]  I'm trying to get the media to focus on that.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  And the Daily Mail is telling you something I told you back when it happened in 2003.
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.000]  Saddam was CIA.
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000]  He was told to invade Kuwait.
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  He was told to attack Iran.
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:24.000]  He was set up.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  He was westernizing Iraq.
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  The Saudis wanted him taken out.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:28.000]  He was set up and double crossed.
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  Our troops aren't bad.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:30.000]  They were manipulated.
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:34.000]  And when the CIA interrogated them, they didn't even know all the classified stuff.
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:38.000]  He told them that he was CIA, that he was hired to do all this, that he was set up.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  And the CIA commander that interrogated him 10 years later admits we were wrong.
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:44.000]  It was all a giant setup.
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  And we let the Shiites execute him 10 years after the tyrants execution,
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:54.000]  the CIA agent who grilled him reveals the shattering truth that everything the US thought was wrong.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  If you read deeper, folks, it was a setup.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  He was CIA trained in 1954 and 55 in Egypt.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000]  He tried to assassinate the Communist leader there.
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  It was overthrown.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  Then they convinced the Ba'ath to take him as their security head in 1969.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:12.000]  In 1979, he staged the CIA coup against the Ba'athists.
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  Then it was set up as a western base.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  They started letting women go to college.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:18.000]  Women in it were burkas.
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  Then he was ordered to attack Iran.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  He lost 700,000 people.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  Iran lost 2 million.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:26.000]  Then he was told to invade Kuwait and set up, and he didn't know why.
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  There you go.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.000]  Don't worry.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000]  HBO has made for TV movies about how bad he is.
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:34.000]  Saudi Arabia, the Wahhabis, the Jihadis, the Al-Qaeda base took out their enemy.
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.000]  He thought when 9-11 happened, he'd join forces with the US to take him out
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000]  because he was their number one enemy at the time.
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  That's Daily Mail.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  Infowars.com has a lot of other news we haven't covered,
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000]  especially on the attack on free speech.
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:58:05.000]  Defenders, spread the link. God bless you all.
