[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  But I know the reason why you gave me such a song
[00:09.000 --> 00:12.000]  No reason to believe
[00:12.000 --> 00:15.000]  The hurt doesn't show
[00:15.000 --> 00:17.000]  But the pain is too gross
[00:17.000 --> 00:23.000]  I'm so strange as to you and me
[00:23.000 --> 00:29.000]  I'm getting caught in the air all night
[00:29.000 --> 00:33.000]  I've been to you alive from deep in the heart of Texas Broadcasting worldwide
[00:33.000 --> 00:37.000]  It Wednesday, March 3rd, the year is 2021
[00:37.000 --> 00:42.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones, honored and blessed to be here, my friends
[00:42.000 --> 00:46.000]  No matter where you live, whether you be a man or a woman, you bleed red blood
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.000]  and you have a connection to God, you are my brother, you are my sister
[00:51.000 --> 00:55.000]  Well, did the Texas Governor really reverse the lockdown?
[00:55.000 --> 00:57.000]  What's really behind it?
[00:57.000 --> 00:59.000]  I'm going to lay it all out today
[00:59.000 --> 01:03.000]  As I told you, the mask lockdown is never going away until you make it go away
[01:03.000 --> 01:05.000]  That doesn't mean it's not going to go away
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.000]  It means they are never going to remove it until you make them remove it
[01:09.000 --> 01:11.000]  until you stop submitting
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.000]  I shot a detailed 9 minute report last night laying this out
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.000]  Let's air part of it and I'm going to come back and give you the rest of the story
[01:19.000 --> 01:22.000]  It has been said by Republican and Democrat presidents alike
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.000]  It's been said by political historians over and over again
[01:25.000 --> 01:30.000]  Because it's true, as Texas goes, so goes the rest of the nation
[01:30.000 --> 01:35.000]  And within hours of Governor Abbott saying he's going to lift the unconstitutional mask mandate
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.000]  and open businesses up 100%
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.000]  All these other states began to fall asleep
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.000]  because that's the leadership of Texas
[01:44.000 --> 01:47.000]  And that's why it's so sad the Governor Abbott went along with his hoax
[01:47.000 --> 01:51.000]  But now he's come out and said the restrictions are lifted
[01:51.000 --> 01:54.000]  But these are restrictions that were not passed by the legislature
[01:54.000 --> 01:57.000]  These are restrictions that violate the state and federal constitution
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.000]  They were frauds the entire time
[01:59.000 --> 02:03.000]  And it's just now that the public began to wake up to this and resist it
[02:03.000 --> 02:05.000]  And the courts began to challenge it
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  And the legislature prepared to convene to block it
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.000]  that Governor Abbott pulled back from his previous activity
[02:11.000 --> 02:15.000]  So in my view, this does not clear Governor Abbott of what he's done
[02:15.000 --> 02:32.000]  in the globalist bankrupt state
[02:32.000 --> 02:39.000]  It is now time to open Texas 100%
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.000]  Everybody who wants to work should have that opportunity
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  Every business that wants to be open should be open
[02:48.000 --> 03:04.000]  Effective next Wednesday, all businesses of any type are allowed to open 100%
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  That includes any type of entity in Texas
[03:08.000 --> 03:13.000]  Also, I am ending the statewide mask mandate
[03:13.000 --> 03:19.000]  Well, the day finally came, March 2nd, 2021
[03:19.000 --> 03:22.000]  After a year of lockdowns and businesses being closed
[03:22.000 --> 03:25.000]  and hundreds of thousands of family businesses and operations
[03:25.000 --> 03:27.000]  shuttering their doors forever
[03:27.000 --> 03:32.000]  Governor Abbott has followed in the footsteps of Governor DeSantis
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  of Florida and Governor Nome, of course, of South Dakota
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  and set a 100% order to reopen the state and no mask mandate
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  Now, there's a lot to unpack there
[03:42.000 --> 03:46.000]  First off, why should the governor be in control of whether we wear a mask over our faces
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.000]  whether local businesses are open
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  And the whole thing is based on a fraud, almost all the deaths were
[03:50.000 --> 03:53.000]  cancer and heart attacks and car wrecks and pneumonia
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.000]  and the flu, which they said doesn't exist this year anywhere in the world
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  The UK didn't have one case of flu
[03:59.000 --> 04:01.000]  Folks, all this is a fraud
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.000]  The same number of people roughly died in 2020, died in 2019
[04:05.000 --> 04:07.000]  And so this hoax is wearing out
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  And thank God, Texas has some history of freedom
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.000]  So unlike California, unlike New York, we had already partially reopened
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.000]  But the idea that we're lucky that he's next Wednesday
[04:17.000 --> 04:20.000]  because I guess, as one of the crew members, Rob said
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.000]  COVID-19 is going to fly out of town from Austin, the capital, next Tuesday
[04:24.000 --> 04:28.000]  So again, this arbitrary idea that he's God, he's the king
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.000]  Because the vaccines have worked so well, and because the numbers of cases are down so much
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  Now he can reopen things
[04:34.000 --> 04:39.000]  It's the PCR test that the inventor said years ago is fake
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.000]  And there's been other big developments on this front
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  We'll tell you the rest of the story in 60 seconds
[04:45.000 --> 05:00.000]  And if you want to get the latest updates, go to www.infowars.com
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  March is here, and we're running a special for only one week

[05:07.000 --> 05:11.000]  Free shipping on storeable food till this next Saturday and 10% off

[05:27.000 --> 05:29.000]  50% off all of it, free shipping
[05:29.000 --> 05:31.000]  Huge deals on gravity-fed water filters
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  Amazing deals on all of our products
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  I'll be frank with you, stuff's so bad, tickets are still out of control
[05:37.000 --> 05:40.000]  I'm trying to sell everything, so we actually have funds inside our compers
[05:40.000 --> 05:43.000]  To keep operating if they shut our shopping carts down
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  We're under a major globalist attack
[05:45.000 --> 05:49.000]  Not because we're the enemy, but because we're standing between you and the globalist
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.000]  The globalists want to bankrupt you, they want to enslave you
[05:52.000 --> 05:55.000]  They want to depopulate you, they want to force inoculate you
[05:55.000 --> 05:59.000]  Fund info wars, and we'll take action against them in the fight
[06:01.000 --> 06:04.000]  We shall go on to the end
[06:04.000 --> 06:06.000]  We shall fight in France
[06:06.000 --> 06:09.000]  We shall fight on the seas and oceans
[06:09.000 --> 06:15.000]  We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air
[06:15.000 --> 06:19.000]  We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be
[06:19.000 --> 06:22.000]  We shall fight on the beaches
[06:22.000 --> 06:24.000]  We shall fight on the landing grounds
[06:24.000 --> 06:28.000]  We shall fight in the fields and in the streets
[06:28.000 --> 06:30.000]  We shall fight in the hills
[06:30.000 --> 06:40.000]  We shall never surrender
[07:01.000 --> 07:09.000]  Governor Abbott lifted the lock down of businesses at 50%, 25% in some parts of the state
[07:09.000 --> 07:15.000]  And said no more mask and left it up to the cities to basically intimidate and continue that process
[07:15.000 --> 07:20.000]  Yes, he was under massive pressure, it's incredibly unpopular
[07:20.000 --> 07:23.000]  And it's destroying the state economy
[07:23.000 --> 07:26.000]  But why did he really do it suddenly yesterday?
[07:26.000 --> 07:29.000]  Because he wasn't planning to announce it
[07:29.000 --> 07:33.000]  He was running from sources until Texas Independence Day next Wednesday
[07:33.000 --> 07:37.000]  And he still went ahead to announce it, that's when it will be, because he had that plan
[07:37.000 --> 07:40.000]  Why did he announce it early?
[07:40.000 --> 07:44.000]  Why did he announce it seven days early?
[07:44.000 --> 07:47.000]  He announced it seven and a half days early
[07:47.000 --> 07:53.000]  Because the legislature of New York passed the law to take the emergency powers away from Cuomo
[07:53.000 --> 07:58.000]  And to end the statewide lock down and to end the mask and 100% go back
[07:58.000 --> 08:02.000]  Well, Texas can't be shown up by the legislature of New York
[08:02.000 --> 08:06.000]  He's also embarrassed by Governor Gnome of South Dakota
[08:06.000 --> 08:09.000]  He's really embarrassed by the Santas
[08:09.000 --> 08:12.000]  And look, I love my state to be a leader, I love Texas
[08:12.000 --> 08:20.000]  My family's been here so long that our land grants from the Spanish, not the Mexicans
[08:20.000 --> 08:26.000]  That's pretty crazy, not many, I mean we're like some of the first 100 families here on my dad and mom's side
[08:26.000 --> 08:30.000]  I'm not bragging, it's just a fact, I love Texas, okay?
[08:30.000 --> 08:34.000]  And I'm related to a bunch of the founders of the state, but we're a wreck, we're a joke
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.000]  We're almost blue, so let's stop acting like we are out of the woods here, okay?
[08:39.000 --> 08:43.000]  I'm just gonna stop right there, I love my state enough to be honest about it
[08:43.000 --> 08:47.000]  We're overrun by the refugees of California who are bringing their problems with them
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.000]  They're so stupid, they bring what destroyed their state to us, but I'm digressing
[08:52.000 --> 08:56.000]  Why did Abbott do this?
[08:56.000 --> 09:06.000]  He was already planning a partial unlocking next week, but he was gonna leave it up to the cities to be their own little tyrants
[09:06.000 --> 09:12.000]  Notice he didn't do that in this speech, he didn't say they still had the power to be tyrants, he just left it there
[09:12.000 --> 09:18.000]  Because he sees the writing on the wall, and so he's playing second fiddle, he's playing catch up
[09:18.000 --> 09:25.000]  So that's why Mississippi and a bunch of other states followed suit when Texas did this yesterday
[09:25.000 --> 09:31.000]  Because it made a lot of news headlines, almost no headlines about New York and why?
[09:31.000 --> 09:38.000]  Because CNN and ABC and NBC and all the rest of the enemy media, they don't want people to know that New York City and New York State
[09:38.000 --> 09:49.000]  Took action and overrode their corrupt evil governor who's in so much trouble
[09:49.000 --> 09:56.000]  So that's why this really happened, now here's the big problem, they're gonna bring this back
[09:56.000 --> 10:02.000]  We'll play the short clip of Abbott, a little 50 second one here in a second where he announces this and everybody cheers
[10:02.000 --> 10:08.000]  The plan is always to restrict and then take the pressure off, and then restrict and take the pressure off
[10:08.000 --> 10:14.000]  And restrict and then take the pressure off, that's what a bogic restrictor does, it wraps around you, crushes you, and then gives itself a break
[10:14.000 --> 10:23.000]  And gives you a break, and the next time, crushes you even harder, until it kills you
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  And that's the process here
[10:25.000 --> 10:30.000]  So everything you see in Australia and in Spain and in Germany and in the UK is coming here
[10:30.000 --> 10:34.000]  This is a worldwide directed program, they admit that's the plan
[10:34.000 --> 10:43.000]  Contact tracers in your house, taking you away if you have a fever, disappearing you, killing you with a ventilator, that's the new guillotine
[10:43.000 --> 10:48.000]  This is their plan, special political facilities run by leptis where leptis doctors kill you
[10:48.000 --> 10:51.000]  It's already happening in Europe
[10:51.000 --> 10:56.000]  People like that sounds insane, yeah this is all insane, they keep babies alive and sell their organs now folks
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  They've had human animal clones for 40 years
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  We're not in Kansas anymore
[11:01.000 --> 11:08.000]  And so, they're talking about the devil strain, and oh oh, there's a new strain in Brazil, it's an atomic bomb
[11:08.000 --> 11:13.000]  Oh 18 million will die, 15, it's all the same lies of a year ago
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.000]  Being recycled, but they've changed the date
[11:17.000 --> 11:20.000]  And they've changed the countries it's coming from
[11:20.000 --> 11:23.000]  All you gotta do is look at the World Almanac or any of the numbers
[11:23.000 --> 11:31.000]  We had the same number of deaths roughly in 2020 as we had in 2019
[11:31.000 --> 11:40.000]  In fact, the numbers went down for population growth, actually death went up a little bit, but if you add population growth and then the aggregate, some average
[11:40.000 --> 11:48.000]  Oh ladies and gentlemen, less died in 2020 than 2019, if you look at the normal increase in death because of population increase
[11:48.000 --> 11:56.000]  So the projection was lower for deaths than it was the year before, the projection, you understand, our country grows by 10, 15 million a year
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.000]  And there's a lot of old folks dying as well, so all these actual worries go together
[12:01.000 --> 12:06.000]  So there's the total fear mongering, in fact guys, even that stack of news I forgot to get to yesterday
[12:06.000 --> 12:16.000]  On the COVID fear mongering, that big stack I had you print, where they're like, oh the devil strain, the Satan strain, the atomic bomb strain, we're all dead state
[12:16.000 --> 12:24.000]  They just increased the fear, and I wanted to go back a year ago and show you the exact same headlines that they're just recycling
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.000]  They just recycle this garbage against you
[12:27.000 --> 12:35.000]  So here is Governor Greg Abbott yesterday at a Mexican food restaurant announcing to the crowd
[12:35.000 --> 12:39.000]  And of course the minute you see no one's wearing masks, because it's called leadership
[12:39.000 --> 12:44.000]  The minute he said, don't need to wear masks, they all stopped virtue signaling and they took the stupid things off
[12:44.000 --> 12:51.000]  They give you bacterial pneumonia, they do not protect you, and it creates the illusion that we're under a crisis when we're not
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  It's a fraud
[12:53.000 --> 12:59.000]  And predictably next segment, I'll read you some of the tweets, big articles on impolwars.com by Don Salos, our Impal Watson
[12:59.000 --> 13:05.000]  They both wrote about it, the left freaking out saying, we're going to wear our masks, our businesses are going to wear their masks
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  You will wear your masks no matter what, because we are virtue signalers
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.000]  They're all about doing something empty that's a fraud
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  That's their religion
[13:14.000 --> 13:18.000]  So here's the Governor quote lifting the mandate
[13:18.000 --> 13:26.000]  So today, I'm issuing a new executive order that rescinds most of the earlier executive orders
[13:26.000 --> 13:37.000]  Effective next Wednesday, all businesses of any type are allowed to open 100%
[13:37.000 --> 13:46.000]  That includes any type of entity in Texas
[13:46.000 --> 13:52.000]  Also, I am ending the statewide mask mandate
[13:52.000 --> 13:58.000]  Okay, and I actually have his statement, there's not a new executive order out yet, we'll get it next Wednesday
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.000]  But I had that in my stack and I scrolled it away and can't find it
[14:02.000 --> 14:07.000]  So during the break, oh, I found it, I found it, I got it right here, I got a statement right here
[14:07.000 --> 14:10.000]  And here's the fine print, and you knew this was going to happen
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.000]  He says that if the COVID numbers go back up to a very low threshold
[14:14.000 --> 14:21.000]  Remember it's supposed to be, you know, 4% of the public dead, 15 million, 18 million dead, remember all that?
[14:21.000 --> 14:30.000]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, now if the hospital beds just get up to a very small level
[14:30.000 --> 14:36.000]  If COVID hospitalizations in any of 22 hospital regions in Texas get about 15% of the hospital bed capacity
[14:36.000 --> 14:41.000]  In that region for 7 straight days, they're going to lock the whole damn thing down again
[14:41.000 --> 14:49.000]  15%, I thought they were all overflowing, they were all empty parking lots for almost a year
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.000]  And a lot of people didn't get that mammogram, they didn't get that check and they died of cancer
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  They admit more people died of not getting medical treatment around the world than died of COVID
[14:58.000 --> 15:07.000]  But it doesn't matter, it's a virtue signal, you're a liberal wearing your mask, you're a hero, you're a dumbass
[15:07.000 --> 15:18.000]  So, look, a daily dollar short, I don't like Abbott, I hate the Democrats more, but they got dirt on his ass
[15:18.000 --> 15:24.000]  And he's going to slap us right back in there, bigger than Dallas, until we just drive it in
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.000]  I mean, you got to get in the face of the left, you got to go to your church, you got to go to restaurants and say
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.000]  I don't want your employees wearing masks, they spread bacteria, they do, it's like a Petri dish
[15:34.000 --> 15:42.000]  H-E-B, I'm not going to H-E-B or any of these grocery stores until you stop, H-E-B says we're going to make our employees wear it and encourage you to
[15:42.000 --> 15:50.000]  Kiss my ass, seriously, you damn commies, thank God my grandmother didn't marry the founder of H-E-B
[15:50.000 --> 15:58.000]  He proposed to her, her name is Rusty Butts, it's actually his name, H-E-B, I'll be right back, stay with us
[15:58.000 --> 16:05.000]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point, it's very bittersweet, everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would
[16:05.000 --> 16:09.000]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that, I care about beating the new world border
[16:09.000 --> 16:14.000]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer
[16:14.000 --> 16:20.000]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us, for a lot of reasons I can't tell you what's going on
[16:20.000 --> 16:25.000]  But let's just say this, we're going to see this through to the end, we're going to stay on air as long as we can
[16:25.000 --> 16:31.000]  So please pray for us and please buy the products, and then pullwarestore.com, they're great products, plus they fund the operation
[16:31.000 --> 16:36.000]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great, do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't
[16:36.000 --> 16:43.000]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice, when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth
[16:43.000 --> 16:48.000]  That's why the globalists are censoring, they can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air
[16:48.000 --> 16:51.000]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word
[16:51.000 --> 16:56.000]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[16:56.000 --> 16:59.000]  And the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said
[16:59.000 --> 17:05.000]  As you know, we're always upping our game at M4 Wars, and we brought you a new supplement, a new product that we know you're going to love
[17:05.000 --> 17:10.000]  Especially if you have trouble sleeping, it is down and out, we don't mean bankrupt under a bridge
[17:10.000 --> 17:13.000]  You don't mean down your bed sleeping hard throughout the night
[17:13.000 --> 17:18.000]  It's got 4 milligrams of high quality melatonin, it's got 25 milligrams of passion flower
[17:18.000 --> 17:22.000]  It's got 50 milligrams of valerian root extract concentrate
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.000]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm, and 150 milligrams of German chamomile
[17:27.000 --> 17:33.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula, I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time
[17:33.000 --> 17:38.000]  It's liquid, so it goes right into your body fast, if you take it sublingually under the tongue, oh
[17:38.000 --> 17:44.000]  Lasting off of sleep is incredible, it's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest, it's so popular, we can't keep it in stock
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.000]  Get yours today, down and out exclusively at M4WareStore.com
[17:48.000 --> 17:52.000]  40% off out of the gates, with free shipping while supplies last

[18:23.000 --> 18:26.000]  This is a rip-off, this is a great rip-off for the Hell's Angels
[18:26.000 --> 18:30.000]  With under S. Thompson in the 60s riding on to that stage in that motorcycle
[18:30.000 --> 18:37.000]  I'm up here in space, I'm looking down on you, my laser's trace
[18:37.000 --> 18:40.000]  Everything you do
[18:40.000 --> 18:45.000]  You think you're privatizing nothing of the time
[18:45.000 --> 18:49.000]  There is no true escape, I'm watching all the time
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.000]  I'm elemental
[18:55.000 --> 18:59.000]  I am perpetual, I keep the country free
[19:01.000 --> 19:03.000]  Alright, let's get serious and not have fun here
[19:03.000 --> 19:07.000]  Because we're not gonna be able to have fun if a new order totally takes over, right?
[19:07.000 --> 19:08.000]  What an incredible time
[19:08.000 --> 19:11.000]  Okay, let me tell you what we got in the stack
[19:11.000 --> 19:14.000]  And I'm not trying to be positive, just to be positive
[19:14.000 --> 19:19.000]  We have amazing news Friday, amazing news Sunday, amazing news Monday
[19:19.000 --> 19:24.000]  And I guess Tuesday, and now Wednesday, I've got a big stack of COVID news here
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  That's just incredibly good
[19:26.000 --> 19:32.000]  Half of healthcare workers in France say the vaccine's poison and crap
[19:32.000 --> 19:35.000]  That's the news admitting it
[19:35.000 --> 19:37.000]  The doctors won't take it
[19:37.000 --> 19:40.000]  The medical unions say shove it up your rear end
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  Excuse my French
[19:42.000 --> 19:47.000]  So we're gonna be getting to all of that in this little stack right here
[19:47.000 --> 19:51.000]  And then there's so much election fraud proof coming out
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  Oh my gosh, and stakes taking action
[19:53.000 --> 19:56.000]  Finding the evidence at Georgia and Arizona
[19:56.000 --> 19:58.000]  It's just incredible
[19:58.000 --> 20:02.000]  That's why the media kept focusing on election machines
[20:02.000 --> 20:05.000]  No, it was fake ballots that they were stealing stuff with
[20:05.000 --> 20:08.000]  That were prepackaged, shipped in, I mean, we've got them
[20:08.000 --> 20:11.000]  And now legislators are getting involved and demanding it and getting it
[20:11.000 --> 20:13.000]  I mean, that's crazy
[20:13.000 --> 20:17.000]  But here and in Europe, they're gonna call populist terrorists
[20:17.000 --> 20:20.000]  Germany is moving to outlaw any nationalist party
[20:20.000 --> 20:24.000]  And it's now put the main nationalist party that's like libertarian party
[20:24.000 --> 20:30.000]  Very milk test, like we should have sovereignty and not too high taxes
[20:30.000 --> 20:34.000]  Oh, you're under government surveillance, you're a terrorist
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.000]  That is all coming up here today
[20:36.000 --> 20:40.000]  And then we have the host of All Gas, No Breaks
[20:40.000 --> 20:45.000]  I'm a big fan coming on the broadcast, Mr. Callahan
[20:45.000 --> 20:47.000]  And guys, give me his bio
[20:47.000 --> 20:50.000]  Pretty please double sugar cupcakes on top
[20:50.000 --> 20:53.000]  I really like that bio in here
[20:53.000 --> 20:57.000]  And that would make me super deluxe happy
[20:57.000 --> 21:02.000]  And so we look for that coming up as well
[21:02.000 --> 21:04.000]  And a lot more
[21:04.000 --> 21:10.000]  We have by-demonstration banning reporters from touring child detention buildings
[21:10.000 --> 21:16.000]  So Trump ended the cages and let everybody get the major tours
[21:16.000 --> 21:25.000]  And then AOC lied and said that they were drinking out of toilets
[21:25.000 --> 21:26.000]  Remember all that?
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  Well, now you just don't get a tour
[21:28.000 --> 21:36.000]  And remember Obama had a policy, the Senate report found, that allowed the trafficking of tens of thousands of children that were given to molesters
[21:36.000 --> 21:40.000]  And many of which ended up dead
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.000]  But see, that's a real Senate report
[21:42.000 --> 21:44.000]  The few people don't care about that
[21:44.000 --> 21:48.000]  They don't talk about underground bases and millions of children, things that don't exist
[21:48.000 --> 21:52.000]  But when it's real stuff, oh no, no, no, no, that's all, that's too real
[21:52.000 --> 21:53.000]  Let's not get into that
[21:53.000 --> 22:00.000]  That is all coming up here as well, and I do intend to also open the phones up
[22:00.000 --> 22:06.000]  Steve Quell's got big news, he'll be with us in the third hour today
[22:06.000 --> 22:10.000]  But they have invited all these people to come up here, now it's a giant crisis
[22:10.000 --> 22:15.000]  They've got more than triple the people normally coming across and Biden is announcing a plan to just let them go
[22:15.000 --> 22:20.000]  He's like, don't worry about cages, I'll just let people grab kids, kidnap kids, just bring them in, do whatever they want
[22:20.000 --> 22:24.000]  And a large portion of little kids that are grabbed, who are used to get in the country
[22:24.000 --> 22:29.000]  Then they're taken back to Mexico to smuggle other people in, and it goes on over and over again
[22:29.000 --> 22:32.000]  But that's liberal to let them use these kidnap children
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.000]  And a lot of times they just, the kid gets sick, they just shoot them in the head, throw them in the ditch
[22:36.000 --> 22:41.000]  And the more patrol, every few days finds little dead kids, or every few days huge 18-wheelers full of dead people
[22:41.000 --> 22:46.000]  And it's just a smarter, oh they found 15 dead Mexicans, or they found 24 dead Hondurans
[22:46.000 --> 22:50.000]  And they found a bunch of little dead, they found a three-year-old dead girl
[22:50.000 --> 22:56.000]  Yeah, she'd been raped a bunch, and she was in a cornfield in South Texas, but you know what, hey
[22:56.000 --> 22:59.000]  Donald Trump's a racist, okay?
[22:59.000 --> 23:05.000]  As he said, we're not going to put up with that, we're going to charge your ass and put you in prison if you've got a kidnap kid
[23:05.000 --> 23:12.000]  Well, not Joe Biden, because again, he's liberal, he's a holy man, he's a good man
[23:12.000 --> 23:18.000]  But let me make a big announcement for everybody right now, and I'm very excited about this
[23:18.000 --> 23:22.000]  People ask, Jones, why do you have three sleep aids?
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  Well, different strokes for different folks
[23:24.000 --> 23:34.000]  I came up with the knockout idea eight years ago, nine years ago, to have melatonin, L-triptophan, valerian root, and four other ingredients, five other ingredients
[23:34.000 --> 23:38.000]  But they're all at mid-level dosages, and it works great, and people love it
[23:38.000 --> 23:45.000]  But like any natural thing in the environment, or any drug for that matter, things stop working, you build up a tolerance
[23:45.000 --> 23:51.000]  So instead of upping the dose, you just use another formula, then you come back to it in six months or a year, it works again
[23:51.000 --> 23:56.000]  We put out rocket rest, my dad did, part of his Dr. Jones naturals
[23:56.000 --> 24:01.000]  That's been backwarded, we haven't gotten that back in, it's fabulously popular
[24:01.000 --> 24:12.000]  I already got a lot of requests from listeners to create a liquid formula of rocket rest, and that is essentially what this is, highest quality organic ingredients
[24:12.000 --> 24:18.000]  It's called down and out, and it's not the top of down and out where you're almost under a bridge because of the COVID lockdown
[24:18.000 --> 24:22.000]  It's down and out, like you're going to be down and out for the night
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.000]  One drop or full, if you just swallow, it's incredibly powerful
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  Put it out of the tongue, hold it for a minute, look out
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.000]  I'd suggest you take about a quarter, the first time you use down and out
[24:33.000 --> 24:38.000]  You got a big shipment of this in, because now that we can't ever get shipments in because of the lockdown of the economy
[24:38.000 --> 24:42.000]  I put in bigger orders hoping to actually get them in, well we got a big shipment then thank god
[24:42.000 --> 24:48.000]  So I can offer 40% off out of the gates on this with free shipping, part of the big sales store wide free shipping right now
[24:48.000 --> 24:54.000]  Melatonin, four milligrams of a high quality source, not all melatonin is great or equal
[24:54.000 --> 24:57.000]  This one, your brain will just slurp up with enjoyment
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  Four milligrams, melatonin
[25:00.000 --> 25:08.000]  25 milligrams, passion flower, traditionally wild harvested Native American and Cherokee favorite
[25:08.000 --> 25:11.000]  And boy does it work amazingly
[25:11.000 --> 25:15.000]  Valerian root extract, 50 milligrams
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.000]  This is down and out folks
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.000]  Lemon balm, 100 milligrams, German chamomile
[25:21.000 --> 25:29.000]  Uses prehistoric times for bedtime tea, the calm nerves from a healthy sleep pattern, 150 juicy milligrams
[25:29.000 --> 25:34.000]  I said, as usual, I said I want people to get an amazing formula
[25:34.000 --> 25:39.000]  They sell watered down crap versions of this at Whole Foods for the same price that are 10% as strong
[25:39.000 --> 25:42.000]  This is down and out, sleep support
[25:42.000 --> 25:45.000]  This is like Mike Tyson in a bottle
[25:45.000 --> 25:48.000]  Look out, be careful the first time you take it
[25:48.000 --> 25:51.000]  And be ready in about 30, 45 minutes to go CP time
[25:51.000 --> 25:55.000]  Because this is even stronger than rocket rest, it's a powdered pill
[25:55.000 --> 25:58.000]  It's a liquid formula of this, concentrate
[25:58.000 --> 26:03.000]  This isn't just passion flower, Valerian root or chamomile, it's the concentrate extract
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.000]  With the four milligrams of melatonin
[26:06.000 --> 26:10.000]  You try to buy melatonin liquid this strong, it costs as much as this does
[26:10.000 --> 26:13.000]  This has all the ingredients in there and no filler
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.000]  Most stuff you buy is a bunch of filler folks, a little bit of what you're paying for and much filler
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  There's no filler in this, sweetheart
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  This is down and out
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.000]  I told them to change the name to Rocket Rest Liquid, but they did this, fine
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  Down and out, it's a great name, whatever
[26:25.000 --> 26:28.000]  InfoWareStore.com, it's amazing and it funds the InfoWare
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  It'll put the globalists down and out, politically
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  So get yours at InfoWareStore.com
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.000]  And only four days left to get 10% off with swirable food and free shipping
[26:36.000 --> 26:39.000]  Free shipping is such a huge deal with swirable food, unprecedented

[26:41.000 --> 26:46.000]  InfoWareStore.com or call toll three, we'll take your call, answer your questions, take your order over the phone
[26:46.000 --> 26:49.000]  Triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  Triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.000]  Let's want to thank you all for your support
[26:53.000 --> 27:22.000]  Let's head back on the other slide with all the news statements
[27:23.000 --> 27:29.000]  We did flood us with the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a Christy
[27:29.000 --> 27:34.000]  Under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign
[27:34.000 --> 27:38.000]  Hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees
[27:38.000 --> 27:43.000]  Not fleeing COVID or climate change as the UN and Klaus Schwab were saying
[27:43.000 --> 27:44.000]  And Bill Gates was saying
[27:44.000 --> 27:50.000]  But fleeing the year long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  Or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money
[27:53.000 --> 27:57.000]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalist
[27:59.000 --> 28:03.000]  We're shooting this on the evening of Monday, March 1st, 2021
[28:03.000 --> 28:09.000]  And in just six days this Saturday, the biggest sale ever on swirable food is going to end
[28:09.000 --> 28:12.000]  Because of the ice storms and the problems around the country, our big supplier
[28:12.000 --> 28:16.000]  Highest quality swirable food at the lowest price, my Patriot, is giving us the best deal ever
[28:16.000 --> 28:21.000]  Free shipping on all of their swirable food, and that's a big cost of swirable food
[28:21.000 --> 28:24.000]  It's shipping because it weighs a lot and 10% off on top of it
[28:24.000 --> 28:27.000]  You won't see this deal come along for a long, long time
[28:27.000 --> 28:31.000]  You've got until this Saturday, the 6th of March, 2021
[28:31.000 --> 28:35.000]  And then contractually they have to end the sale because they have hundreds of distributors
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  And they're getting mad that we're undercutting the price
[28:37.000 --> 28:38.000]  So they decided to do this
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  So it's exclusively available, there's a few days left
[28:40.000 --> 28:46.000]  At infowarstore.com or parallelics.com takes you right to specials, all their food, all their packages
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.000]  One month, six month a year, it's all for parallelics.com
[28:49.000 --> 28:52.000]  Take advantage of it now, and it puts you forward
[28:59.000 --> 29:03.000]  The entire new world order system is about making you feel pathetic
[29:03.000 --> 29:06.000]  Making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim
[29:06.000 --> 29:10.000]  So you don't take your birthright as being made the image of God
[29:10.000 --> 29:12.000]  And the incredible mission and destiny we have
[29:12.000 --> 29:14.000]  Being given free will
[29:14.000 --> 29:17.000]  Being given free will, being given consciousness
[29:17.000 --> 29:22.000]  Is literally the seed of an entire universe, an entire system
[29:22.000 --> 29:25.000]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.000]  The fact that you're able to see the beauty of the sunset
[29:27.000 --> 29:29.000]  Or the beauty of the waves in the ocean
[29:29.000 --> 29:31.000]  Or the beauty of your wife or your husband
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  Or the beauty of your child learning knowledge
[29:33.000 --> 29:35.000]  The beauty of music
[29:35.000 --> 29:39.000]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic
[29:39.000 --> 29:43.000]  And that itself is what God teaches us, is worship
[29:43.000 --> 29:46.000]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL
[29:46.000 --> 29:48.000]  Don't worship all the things in the system
[29:48.000 --> 29:51.000]  But worship the things of God, because we're made by God
[29:51.000 --> 29:53.000]  And appreciate your consciousness
[29:53.000 --> 29:55.000]  And appreciate free speech
[29:55.000 --> 30:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[30:25.000 --> 30:43.000]  They're triggering a civil war against humanity
[30:43.000 --> 30:45.000]  Humanity against ourselves
[30:45.000 --> 30:47.000]  Leaving we're toxic, leaving we're evil
[30:47.000 --> 30:51.000]  No, we are life
[30:51.000 --> 30:53.000]  We are love
[30:53.000 --> 30:55.000]  We are coming together
[30:55.000 --> 30:57.000]  The enemy's not going to stop that
[30:57.000 --> 30:59.000]  That's why they're invoking racism and division
[30:59.000 --> 31:02.000]  And the name of fighting it, because they want us divided
[31:02.000 --> 31:04.000]  So we will fall, we will not fall
[31:04.000 --> 31:09.000]  We will come together, we will defeat the enemy's design
[31:09.000 --> 31:12.000]  All right, let's lay it out
[31:12.000 --> 31:14.000]  I told you, I see this is really good news
[31:14.000 --> 31:17.000]  We'll obviously try to open the phones up if not today, tomorrow
[31:17.000 --> 31:19.000]  I've been coming in doing the Saturday show
[31:19.000 --> 31:22.000]  I think I'll do a big live Saturday one this Saturday about time
[31:22.000 --> 31:24.000]  I'm going to be out of town and take calls
[31:24.000 --> 31:26.000]  Your calls are so precious, but a lot of times
[31:26.000 --> 31:28.000]  The commercial free show is the best for calls
[31:28.000 --> 31:31.000]  We can really get to a lot of you, but let me just hit these headlines
[31:31.000 --> 31:34.000]  Then I'll obviously tell you why I think it's positive
[31:34.000 --> 31:36.000]  We have a Texas Governor in mass mandate
[31:36.000 --> 31:38.000]  Opens Texas up 100%
[31:38.000 --> 31:42.000]  Even though there's a hidden barb in there
[31:42.000 --> 31:45.000]  It still means they're having to bend to the will of the people
[31:45.000 --> 31:47.000]  At least in name only so that we kind of go to sleep
[31:47.000 --> 31:49.000]  Then they'll put the pressure back on, that's the tactic
[31:49.000 --> 31:52.000]  Texas Governor Abbot declares in to statewide mass mandate
[31:52.000 --> 31:54.000]  Complete loss of trust
[31:54.000 --> 31:59.000]  Half of French home health workers say they'll resist taking vaccine
[31:59.000 --> 32:03.000]  Half of French home health workers
[32:03.000 --> 32:05.000]  And then you've got similar articles
[32:05.000 --> 32:09.000]  Of upwards of half the medical staff of hospitals are refusing
[32:09.000 --> 32:13.000]  At ZeroHedge.com, up on infowars.com
[32:13.000 --> 32:19.000]  Dem-led New York legislature reaches deal to repeal Governor Cuomo's pandemic orders
[32:19.000 --> 32:22.000]  That came through yesterday afternoon
[32:22.000 --> 32:25.000]  And the Texas Governor again jumped in front of it
[32:25.000 --> 32:28.000]  Because he didn't want to play second fiddle to New York
[32:28.000 --> 32:30.000]  Well, guess what you do, buddy boy
[32:30.000 --> 32:32.000]  They're leaders, you're not
[32:32.000 --> 32:36.000]  Following Texas, Mississippi, drops COVID, mass mandate
[32:36.000 --> 32:40.000]  Along with other states that have already done it, reiterated that it's over
[32:40.000 --> 32:42.000]  Yeah, it's over when you admit it's a fraud
[32:42.000 --> 32:45.000]  No more deaths last year than the year before
[32:45.000 --> 32:48.000]  Despite population increase
[32:48.000 --> 32:50.000]  Leftist vow, though, to continue wearing masks
[32:50.000 --> 32:53.000]  Despite Governor Greg Abbott's ending statewide mandate
[32:53.000 --> 32:55.000]  You gotta go read this Paul Joseph Watson article
[32:55.000 --> 32:58.000]  It's like, I realize how dirty and gross humans are
[32:58.000 --> 33:01.000]  I'm wearing my mask forever
[33:01.000 --> 33:03.000]  We've gotta hold the line and be heroes
[33:03.000 --> 33:05.000]  And wear masks and never stop
[33:05.000 --> 33:07.000]  Of course this evil Republican has done this
[33:07.000 --> 33:11.000]  I mean, you read this, he's like a cartoon character wrote it
[33:11.000 --> 33:13.000]  These people are nuts
[33:13.000 --> 33:15.000]  Don't read the quotes, man, they're in the article
[33:15.000 --> 33:17.000]  I'm not joking, I'm done paraphrased that
[33:17.000 --> 33:19.000]  That's what they actually say
[33:19.000 --> 33:21.000]  Adan Salazar wrote about it
[33:21.000 --> 33:23.000]  at infowars.com too
[33:23.000 --> 33:29.000]  Triggered Democrats furious about Texas Governor Lyft's mass mandate
[33:29.000 --> 33:31.000]  Look at these
[33:31.000 --> 33:33.000]  I just announced Texas is 100% open
[33:33.000 --> 33:37.000]  Everything also into the statewide mass mandate
[33:37.000 --> 33:39.000]  Here's the mayor of Austin
[33:39.000 --> 33:42.000]  They're urging the governor to keep the mass mandate in place
[33:42.000 --> 33:45.000]  Wearing masks keeps our businesses and schools safely open
[33:45.000 --> 33:48.000]  Decreases community spread of the virus and saves lives
[33:48.000 --> 33:51.000]  BS, BS, BS
[33:51.000 --> 33:53.000]  At best, this is what you're thinking
[33:53.000 --> 33:56.000]  That COVID is somehow less dangerous than it was yesterday
[33:56.000 --> 33:59.000]  At worst, it's a cynical attempt to distract Texas from failures
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.000]  Of state oversight of the power grid
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.000]  That's the state rep
[34:05.000 --> 34:08.000]  Every time you start moving in the right direction
[34:08.000 --> 34:10.000]  The governor steps in and sets us back
[34:10.000 --> 34:12.000]  And makes us all of our jobs harder
[34:12.000 --> 34:14.000]  He minimizes the sacrifices of people and businesses
[34:14.000 --> 34:16.000]  I just don't get it
[34:16.000 --> 34:18.000]  Since facial coverings were implemented
[34:18.000 --> 34:22.000]  We experienced a major reduction in cases and hospitalizations
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.000]  BS, BS, BS
[34:24.000 --> 34:26.000]  Science shows, science
[34:26.000 --> 34:28.000]  You use the word science, you're so impressive
[34:28.000 --> 34:31.000]  Shows us that communities are freer, freer
[34:31.000 --> 34:34.000]  And far better, like the freedom bristles in Israel
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  Then when citizens wear simple masks
[34:36.000 --> 34:39.000]  In Fort Bend, we continue to listen to the doctor's facts
[34:39.000 --> 34:42.000]  And the science, yes, that 15 million would be dead
[34:42.000 --> 34:45.000]  In a month last year and all this crap
[34:48.000 --> 34:50.000]  These aren't even the bad quotes
[34:50.000 --> 34:52.000]  Let me read you the ones Watson's got in his articles, man
[34:52.000 --> 34:54.000]  It is just insane
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  So there's Abbott's tweet and they say
[34:58.000 --> 35:00.000]  There's some crazy stuff
[35:00.000 --> 35:02.000]  Dear fellow Texans
[35:02.000 --> 35:04.000]  Please ignore this man
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  He doesn't have a damn whether you live or die
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  He's concerned with profits, not people
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.000]  Oh yeah, that's why all the big mega banks
[35:10.000 --> 35:12.000]  Were doubling, tripling profits, starving the third world to death
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  But just everything they say is an inversion
[35:14.000 --> 35:16.000]  Dear fellow Texans
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.000]  Was this some recent California transplant?
[35:18.000 --> 35:20.000]  Dear fellow Texans, please ignore this man
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  He doesn't give a damn whether you live or die
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  He's concerned with profits, not people
[35:24.000 --> 35:27.000]  Continue as you were until more people are vaccinated
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  We have to take care of each other
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  Because the Texas GOP isn't up in the past
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  Up in the past
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  And it goes on and on
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  Here's one
[35:37.000 --> 35:39.000]  I intend to continue wearing masks
[35:39.000 --> 35:41.000]  Because I am one of the millions of Texans
[35:41.000 --> 35:43.000]  Not yet eligible for vaccination
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  I also plan to do what I can to not give any business
[35:45.000 --> 35:47.000]  Establishments that unmask
[35:47.000 --> 35:49.000]  Oh yeah, right
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  Either way
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  I'll keep wearing mine
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.000]  I never realize how nasty some people are
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.000]  Especially when coughing and sneezing
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.000]  I don't need other people's germs
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  A whole year since the started
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  I've not been sick with a cold
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  Prior to COVID, I was sick
[36:05.000 --> 36:07.000]  Oh yeah, right
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  It's just so good
[36:09.000 --> 36:11.000]  There's no flu either, dumbass
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  Oh, these people
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  So Democrats are furious about that
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  Big interview with David Icke
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.000]  On the Band-Ought video
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  We're facing the end of humanity unless we push back
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  Yes, sir, share that video folks
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.000]  Return to normal might hurt Facebook's bottom line
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  Chief Financial Officer says
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  Wait a minute, that lady said
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  That lady said the lockdowns
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  Are good
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  And that Abbott wants to end them for profits
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  What, for local businesses?
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  For local governments?
[36:41.000 --> 36:43.000]  You mean staying alive? Farmers?
[36:43.000 --> 36:45.000]  Restaurants?
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.000]  Schools? Yeah, yeah
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.000]  Yeah, not going bankrupt and being homeless is important
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  We don't all have government jobs like you
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  There was 15 days to slow the spread
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  That was it, here we are a year later
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  And then across what we think
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  We must never reopen, it is full of the earth
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  No businesses, human contact
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  You stay at home, robot, to live a food
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  I own everything, I mean this is like
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  Aliens land and the Simpsons is like
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  I am gore, but I rule you
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  Never leave your home again
[37:11.000 --> 37:13.000]  These robots will feed you
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.000]  You're like, the robots are getting us to starve ourselves
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.000]  Once they're in control, they'll kill us
[37:17.000 --> 37:19.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  I don't know if aliens run it, I'm just saying
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  Sounds like a science fiction movie
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  Plot to me, okay?
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  I mean, no businesses
[37:27.000 --> 37:29.000]  Where you see human
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  Stay at home, robot bring
[37:31.000 --> 37:33.000]  And you have nothing you like
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  And you'll drink sewage
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  And you're going to have
[37:37.000 --> 37:39.000]  Blood meat
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  I mean, he literally
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  I mean, you're like, this is dystopic
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  They're just bombing you with it
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  And their people have Stockholm syndrome
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  The New York Times ran a headline
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  Don't critically think just accept
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  What you're told by authoritative sources
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  Then they ran a gaslighting article
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  Saying, oh, that's not what they meant
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  Yeah, there's now combat robots
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  On the ground in New York in LA
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  Oh, return to normal
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  Mike Hurt
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  Facebook's bottom line CFO admits
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  Facebook's CFO is concerned
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  That as more people get vaccinated
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  Against the coronavirus, they'll be less
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  Click on Facebook ads and more likely to seek out
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  Travel and non-sedentary pursuits
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  That are so depressing and killing you
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  That's David Weher
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  Suggested
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.000]  On Tuesday that users
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  Cash will end up in
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  Pockets of services like travel
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  And more people get vaccinated
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  See, because they all doubled and tripled their profits
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  See, that's why Fauci said
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  Actually, even though you had the shot
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  You can't go out ever and you got to wear a mask
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  I'm not going to hit you
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  I'm not imitating his voice, but
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  I'm not saying everybody will die
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  Just most of the people
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  Oh, my gosh
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  There's so much more to hit
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  South Korea launches an investigation
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  In the deaths of two people
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  Days after receiving
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  Meanwhile, report
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  Border crossers released in the U.S.
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  By Biden officials test positive for coronavirus
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  And then released
[39:15.000 --> 39:17.000]  I say release them, it's all fake deaths anyways
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  I mean, to port them back to the illegal
[39:19.000 --> 39:21.000]  But not with the super virus
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  New York Governor Cuomo's sex scandal
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  Distracts from
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  Deadly COVID nursing home to Backel
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  KellenMcBrainInfoWars.com
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  I agree
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  They're just using that, they're using one story to kill another story
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  Because
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  The COVID death story goes back to the globalists
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  And Fauci and the U.N.
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  So that's why they want to kill that
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  On
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  How they're trying to stage a false flag to blame the liberty movement
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  How they're banning Dr. Seuss
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  I'm not kidding, Dr. Seuss books are now $5,000 a piece
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  That's what I have, original Dr. Seuss art
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  Hanging on the walls of the office
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  Do you know that? Yeah
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  Blisters ask me all the time
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  Why do you have multiple multi-vitamins?
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  Why do you have multiple
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  High-quality iodines?
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  Why do you do that? Because
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  Different strokes for different folks
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  A lot of people love deep earth pure crystal iodine
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  But you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  And the two other types
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  Because some people can't absorb pure iodine
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  Boom, we did it, it's popular in sex 3
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  Is it better than sex 2?
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  You decide, it's different strokes for different folks
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  Well now we have a compliment
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  To knock out our very popular powdered pill
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  Sleepy
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  And that is down and out
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  It's super strong, way stronger
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  Than knocked out, but they don't compete with each other
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  Different strokes for different folks
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  Different formulas, and it's 40% off
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  Out of the gates
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  At M4store.com and free shipping
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  Secure your down and out today, and while you're sleeping
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  You know you're funding the M4 at the same time
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  Down and out, it's exclusively available
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  At M4store.com for 40% off and free shipping
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  I don't like coming to you and saying this
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  To be our last broadcast
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  Hell, I've been on there for 27 years
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  And only the last year or so have I said that
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  Two world orders breathing down our neck
[41:07.000 --> 41:09.000]  The big globalist publications are coming after us
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  And they're doing everything they can to shut us down
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.000]  So please pray to keep M4 Wars on the air
[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  And please support the local states
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  You're listening to as well
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  At the same time, go to M4store.com
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  While you still can, and get a book
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  Get a film, get a t-shirt
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  Get some supplements, because it's that money
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  That helps us stay on air
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  In the face of this thing
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  I need your help more than ever now
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  I want to keep fighting the globalists
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  But I can't do it
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  If you don't support us
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  Pray for us, word of mouth
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  Tell folks about the broadcast, however you can
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  And buy great products that will enrich you
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  And your family's lives every day
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  At M4store.com
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  Whether it's high quality coffee, or supplements
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  Or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  All of it empowers humanity
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  All of it is pro-human and pro-god
[41:55.000 --> 42:05.000]  Thank you so much
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  All of it free shipping
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.000]  Huge deals on gravity-fed water filters
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  Amazing deals on all of our products
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  I'll be frank with you
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  Stuff so bad, fingers so out of control
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  I'm trying to sell of everything
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  So we actually have funds inside our coffers
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  To keep operating if they shut our shopping carts down
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  We're under a major globalist attack
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  Not because we're the enemy
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  But because we're standing between you and the globalist
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  The globalists want to bankrupt you
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  They want to enslave you
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  They want to depopulate you
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  Of course, inoculate you
[42:55.000 --> 42:57.000]  Fund info wars and we'll take action against them
[42:57.000 --> 42:59.000]  In the fight
[42:59.000 --> 43:01.000]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point
[43:01.000 --> 43:03.000]  It's very bittersweet
[43:03.000 --> 43:05.000]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would
[43:05.000 --> 43:07.000]  And now we have a lot of credibility
[43:07.000 --> 43:09.000]  But I don't care about that
[43:09.000 --> 43:11.000]  I care about beating the new world order
[43:11.000 --> 43:13.000]  And it's because we have so much credibility
[43:13.000 --> 43:15.000]  They can't allow us to stay on air much longer
[43:15.000 --> 43:17.000]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us
[43:17.000 --> 43:19.000]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on
[43:19.000 --> 43:21.000]  But let's just say this
[43:21.000 --> 43:23.000]  We're going to see this through to the end
[43:23.000 --> 43:25.000]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can
[43:25.000 --> 43:27.000]  So please pray for us
[43:27.000 --> 43:29.000]  And please buy the products
[43:29.000 --> 43:31.000]  They're great products
[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  Plus they fund the operation
[43:33.000 --> 43:35.000]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy
[43:35.000 --> 43:37.000]  They're still great
[43:37.000 --> 43:39.000]  Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't
[43:39.000 --> 43:41.000]  These are great products that fund freedom
[43:41.000 --> 43:43.000]  And fund justice
[43:43.000 --> 43:45.000]  When the whole world's waking up and looking for truth
[43:45.000 --> 43:47.000]  That's why the globalists are censoring
[43:47.000 --> 43:49.000]  They can't bring in all this tyranny
[43:49.000 --> 43:51.000]  Don't just financially support us
[43:51.000 --> 43:53.000]  Download everything we've done
[43:53.000 --> 43:55.000]  You can find and save it
[43:55.000 --> 43:57.000]  Because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[43:57.000 --> 44:19.000]  To destroy everything we ever said
[44:19.000 --> 44:27.000]  The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  But nobody wants to know him
[44:29.000 --> 44:33.000]  They can see that he's just a fool
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  And he never gives an answer
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.000]  But the fool under him
[44:39.000 --> 44:43.000]  Sees the sun going down
[44:43.000 --> 44:45.000]  And the eyes in his head
[44:45.000 --> 44:49.000]  Sees the world spinning round
[44:49.000 --> 44:51.000]  That's right ladies and gentlemen
[44:51.000 --> 44:52.000]  Welcome back
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.000]  We have a special guest joining us in the studio
[44:54.000 --> 44:56.000]  Next to our
[44:56.000 --> 44:58.000]  Head in a cloud
[44:58.000 --> 44:59.000]  Andrew
[44:59.000 --> 45:01.000]  Channelhand of All Gas No Breaks
[45:01.000 --> 45:03.000]  And then Steve Quail
[45:03.000 --> 45:05.000]  And again
[45:05.000 --> 45:07.000]  I'm not trying to make the show about myself
[45:07.000 --> 45:09.000]  Because that's boring overall
[45:09.000 --> 45:11.000]  But if it could be illustrative about lies and deception
[45:11.000 --> 45:13.000]  Or if it's an attempt to shut us down
[45:13.000 --> 45:15.000]  I will cover it
[45:15.000 --> 45:17.000]  And so here in a few minutes
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  Before our guest joins us
[45:19.000 --> 45:21.000]  I'm going to hit this
[45:21.000 --> 45:23.000]  And when I saw this just at the end of the day
[45:23.000 --> 45:25.000]  Or about four or five o'clock
[45:25.000 --> 45:28.000]  I didn't even read the
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.000]  Southern Barbara Law Center story
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.000]  Because I already knew it was going to be in it
[45:32.000 --> 45:34.000]  And then sure as hell
[45:34.000 --> 45:36.000]  I got up this morning and I read it
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.000]  And I was like
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.000]  That is the biggest lie
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  That's just a new level
[45:43.000 --> 45:45.000]  It's like the Daily Mail had a headline
[45:45.000 --> 45:47.000]  Alex Jones says Bill Gates is putting HIV
[45:47.000 --> 45:49.000]  In the vaccines
[45:49.000 --> 45:51.000]  And attacked his wife with a helicopter
[45:51.000 --> 45:53.000]  None of it was even true
[45:53.000 --> 45:55.000]  And they have a puppet show of Howard Stern in December
[45:55.000 --> 45:57.000]  Saying that's me
[45:57.000 --> 45:59.000]  A popsicle stick puppet
[45:59.000 --> 46:01.000]  They don't even care folks
[46:01.000 --> 46:03.000]  It's next level
[46:03.000 --> 46:05.000]  But this latest one I'll tell you about in a minute
[46:05.000 --> 46:07.000]  Mind
[46:07.000 --> 46:13.000]  Blowing
[46:13.000 --> 46:15.000]  But it's the Southern Barbara Law Center
[46:15.000 --> 46:17.000]  I mean
[46:17.000 --> 46:19.000]  It's actually hilarious
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  Actually I'm just like
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.000]  Wow man these people are crazy
[46:23.000 --> 46:25.000]  I was like
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  Trending last night
[46:27.000 --> 46:29.000]  Remember 7 on Twitter
[46:29.000 --> 46:31.000]  I didn't even know about it
[46:31.000 --> 46:33.000]  I got a call I said hey you know you're trending on Twitter
[46:33.000 --> 46:35.000]  That you hate Donald Trump
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.000]  Sorry
[46:37.000 --> 46:39.000]  I'll say about it in a minute
[46:39.000 --> 46:41.000]  It's really simple what they did
[46:41.000 --> 46:43.000]  And I should shoot a report
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.000]  So I can actually condense it down just a few minutes
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.000]  So you don't waste your time
[46:47.000 --> 46:49.000]  But it's just incredible
[46:49.000 --> 46:51.000]  And those are regular listeners
[46:51.000 --> 46:53.000]  Know how I talk
[46:53.000 --> 46:55.000]  You're like I've already said this a hundred times
[46:55.000 --> 46:57.000]  Or I've already said this on Joe Rogan
[46:57.000 --> 46:59.000]  But I'll talk about it in a moment
[46:59.000 --> 47:01.000]  But let me hit these headlines for you first
[47:01.000 --> 47:03.000]  Biden admin
[47:03.000 --> 47:05.000]  Planning for influx
[47:05.000 --> 47:07.000]  Of 117,000
[47:07.000 --> 47:09.000]  Legal use to the U.S.
[47:09.000 --> 47:11.000]  Documents that they leaked show
[47:11.000 --> 47:13.000]  But now they admit they leaked them to get the subject
[47:13.000 --> 47:15.000]  Off of the fact
[47:15.000 --> 47:17.000]  That they do have kids in cages
[47:17.000 --> 47:19.000]  In fact they put them back into real cages
[47:19.000 --> 47:21.000]  Because since he set open the borders
[47:21.000 --> 47:23.000]  They've got triple the influx they normally get
[47:23.000 --> 47:25.000]  Great Steve Watson
[47:25.000 --> 47:27.000]  Article because he gives you the whole backstory
[47:27.000 --> 47:29.000]  It's excellent doesn't just tell you what Biden's up to
[47:29.000 --> 47:31.000]  Arizona Department of Education
[47:31.000 --> 47:33.000]  He teaches
[47:33.000 --> 47:35.000]  And teaches that
[47:35.000 --> 47:37.000]  Babies are racist
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  And that children from birth
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  Must form anti-racist white identity
[47:41.000 --> 47:43.000]  Anti-white identity
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  Dr. Seuss Book
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  Prices skyrocket
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  Up to 5,000
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  After they're canceled for racism
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  By the way I don't own
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  Really any fine art
[47:55.000 --> 47:57.000]  But I did go to his museum
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  In Maui
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  And after I got married
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  And I bought a few pieces
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  That are
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  Small number prints of his work
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  Big big ones he drew these big
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  He drew each page like big big canvas
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  I remember joking I said this will be politically correct one day
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  Because the characters are mainly white
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  Or green
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  And sure as hell it's on
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  Because they want control over all language
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  All communication it's meant to be fantastical
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  It's meant to look stupid
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  But notice it happens
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  Of course folks you'll have the video
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  Of
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  Obama reading one of these satanic manuals
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  Flashback Obama
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  Reads racist Dr. Seuss books
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  On TV the children
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  Wow
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  Well they say math racist too
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  Amazon redesigns logo to look
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  Less like Hitler after complaints
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  It looks nothing like Hitler
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  I'll cover this
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  Next hour we'll actually show you the images
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  Because the way this printed it doesn't have them
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  I mean this is insane
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  Harvard Harris pulled
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  Yeah there it is
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  I think the new one looks more like Hitler
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  The old one is a shopping cart
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  And the little devil tail
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  But now it's actually like a Hitler mustache
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  That's the new one
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  So that looks more like Hitler
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  Than the thing before
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  It's like some scythe man
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  This is all like a sick joke
[49:23.000 --> 49:25.000]  I'm sorry
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.000]  I just
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  I see people are out of control man
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  Harvard Harris pulled Americans more
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  Concerned over summer violence
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  Than January 6th plot
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  I think so all the cities based on fire
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  Should have been in Austin I mean you couldn't even go anywhere
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  Like burning stuff everywhere
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  Riot people being attacked it was bad man
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  And Austin wasn't one of the bad cities
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  But I mean I live here it was bad
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  Security at Capitol building increased
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  Following warning of a militia plot
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  Oh my god there's a warning
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  Ten thousand more troops on top of that
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  Every day I see where a prominent transgender
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  Is caught with child porn
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  Or diddling children
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.000]  In this case the transgender daycare worker
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  Ran out of their house
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  And they already had complaints that they were
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  Fiddling with the kids
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  But now they got caught with the child porn
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  Of three year old babies being raped
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  Transgender daycare worker and youtube star
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  Charged with possessing child porn
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  All abuse images
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  And there's been a bunch of investigations of them
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  Again parents saying that they
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  Friddle diddle their children
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  Well I mean it looks statistically
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  You drop your kid off with a dude
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  That says they're a woman
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  That's obsessed with sexualizing children
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  That's like dropping
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  A bleeding person into a pool of piranhas
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  In the Brazilian rainforest
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  It's like jumping in like the
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  Garbage dump
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  They get bulls in it when they're starving
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  I mean I don't know what
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  To put a worm on a hook and throw it in a pool of bass
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  That's what goes together
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  Like a horse and carriage
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  The whole transgender movement
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  Is beyond just raping children
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  It wants to cut their breasts and genitals off
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  Imagine a horror movie where there's a cult
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  That wants to cut children's genitals off
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  But they convince them under mind control
[51:09.000 --> 51:11.000]  To do it
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  And they get mentally ill autistic kids to do it
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.000]  Not enough they shot them up with chemicals
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  And killed them, brain damaged them
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  Now they want their genitals as well
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.000]  Because the genitals will still pass on intelligence
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  They fried the potential nervous system
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  But not the genetic code sequencers
[51:25.000 --> 51:27.000]  They want those code sequencers
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  Because these are not of this world folks
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  They're jacked in interface
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  And it's all the same dude
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  Same dude attacking
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  It's kind of like an oblivion Tom Cruise movie
[51:37.000 --> 51:39.000]  It's like yeah and then they landed
[51:39.000 --> 51:41.000]  And millions of you came out
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  It's like the same dude, the same program
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  The same thing
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  We dress as women when we attack them and get their children
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.000]  Attack, attack, attack
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.000]  It's like Mars attacks when they go to the White House
[51:51.000 --> 51:53.000]  And the woman has the big beehive
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.000]  Hair cut that's really an alien
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  I mean whatever it is folks it's the same thing
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  It's the same model over and over
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  And over again and over again
[52:01.000 --> 52:03.000]  When you're in like Seattle
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  Where they're heavily demonically possessed
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  Again
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  You cross one street and it's like
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  Agent Smith jumping in person after person
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  Zimmerman saw it and said I'm not leaving the hotel
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  After he was in the second time
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  He was doing camera for me then
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  He does IT now
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  And it was like we cross one street
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  They say something in a demonic voice
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  And the next street was like yeah
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  We're watching you still
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  And Zimmerman's like my god
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  Christ talks about the Bible
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  Where the demons jump from one dude to the next
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  And he goes around one street and they say it again
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  They jump in pigs, they run off the cliff
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  I mean it's like
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  Avatar folks, I don't know what it is
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  But when you're a public figure like I am
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  And they don't like you, they unmask
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  Just like the Matrix
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  And they're all synced up
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  And they walk around like goblins
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  They go like
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  They have like green skin
[52:55.000 --> 52:57.000]  And they all have like demonic smiles
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  And like again
[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  You'll walk down the street and one will say something
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  And the next one finishes the sentence
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  You're like okay what's going on here
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  They're like
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  I want your children
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  I want your children
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  Like how many videos do I have
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  Where they walk up and go I want children
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  And start like hopping around all crazy
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  Like at that thing in downtown Austin
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  I went to the anti Alex Jones
[53:21.000 --> 53:23.000]  The fake news of Donald Trump and Alex Jones event
[53:23.000 --> 53:25.000]  They had downtown blocked off, I get there
[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  And then these men start flopping
[53:27.000 --> 53:29.000]  And trying to lick me like I want children
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  And you're just like what the hell is this
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  Well it's
[53:35.000 --> 53:37.000]  The thing is it wants our children
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.000]  Imagine if agent Smith was a pedophile
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  That's what you're dealing with
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  Okay I didn't get to the thing I said I've got
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  And you know what I'll do
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  While the guest is here all gas no breaks
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  I'll play this for you
[53:49.000 --> 53:51.000]  Because I even told them about an interview to me this morning
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  This is insane I'll cover it next hour
[53:53.000 --> 53:55.000]  They said that I put a video
[53:55.000 --> 53:57.000]  It was a secret leaked video of me saying I hate Trump
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.000]  It's an edited video
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  I'm going to show you the full video from a film
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.000]  That's like on Netflix
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  Or Amazon everywhere
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  And now an edited video from a film on TV
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  It's now a secret video
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  Me and the studio all these lights
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  They edit this tape to say I hate Trump
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  And then media matters
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  And all of them and what's the name of it
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  Southern Barbara Law Center
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  That offshore terror group
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  They put all this out it's hilarious
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  So that's coming up next hour

[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  And calm discussion about

[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  To reality

[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  In joints and the digestive system
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  Recent studies have suggested
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  That high EPA and DHA
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  Fish oil can stimulate
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  Immune function by increasing
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  The concentration and activity
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  That pertain to reality

[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  At infowarstore.com
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[57:01.000 --> 57:03.000]  To bring you another naive
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.000]  Broadcast of the Echo Chamber
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  Getting to their bottom
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  What happened at the Capitol
[57:09.000 --> 57:11.000]  On January 6th
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  For the most part, the proceedings attempted
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  To investigate claims based on
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  The Democrats' perception of what
[57:17.000 --> 57:19.000]  Happened by spinning outright lies
[57:19.000 --> 57:21.000]  Riders, there may be
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  Confederate flags, they're hanging
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  Neuses on the front lawn
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  They're verbally assaulting a tourist
[57:27.000 --> 57:29.000]  Reporter outside the Capitol
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  Saying you are cattle today
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  That refers to cow cars
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  That were used to transport Jews
[57:35.000 --> 57:37.000]  To Nazi death camps
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  During the holocaust
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  This violent attack on the Capitol
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  Featured followers from
[57:43.000 --> 57:45.000]  The anti-Semitic QAnon
[57:45.000 --> 57:47.000]  Conspiracy theory
[57:47.000 --> 57:49.000]  So Mr. Conti, on January 4th
[57:49.000 --> 57:51.000]  Metro Police Department
[57:51.000 --> 57:53.000]  Arrested in Ripe Carillo
[57:53.000 --> 57:55.000]  Leader of the racist
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.000]  Anti-Semitic proud boys hate group
[57:57.000 --> 57:59.000]  For the record, the proud boys
[57:59.000 --> 58:01.000]  Are not an anti-Semitic
[58:01.000 --> 58:03.000]  White supremacist organization
[58:03.000 --> 58:05.000]  So the irony here is
[58:05.000 --> 58:07.000]  That I'm an egalitarian
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.000]  I'm an anti-racist
[58:09.000 --> 58:11.000]  I'm a pro-gay
[58:11.000 --> 58:13.000]  Pro-woman's rights individual
[58:13.000 --> 58:15.000]  The same punk rocker I was when I was 18
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  But now the Nazi skinheads
[58:17.000 --> 58:19.000]  I'm fighting are you
[58:19.000 --> 58:21.000]  Social justice warriors
[58:21.000 --> 58:23.000]  I started a men's club
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  Called the Proud Boys and we have one caveat
[58:25.000 --> 58:27.000]  And that is, you have to be a western
[58:27.000 --> 58:29.000]  Chauvinist
[58:29.000 --> 58:31.000]  Now libbles are lazy
[58:31.000 --> 58:33.000]  So they hear the word chauvinist
[58:33.000 --> 58:35.000]  And they assume male chauvinist
[58:35.000 --> 58:37.000]  And that's why I use that word
[58:37.000 --> 58:39.000]  Because they're too lazy to look it up
[58:39.000 --> 58:41.000]  And it just means a nationalist, a patriot
[58:41.000 --> 58:43.000]  And you have to think the west is the best
[58:43.000 --> 58:45.000]  And it exploded
[58:45.000 --> 58:47.000]  But much like
[58:47.000 --> 58:49.000]  The Charlottesville hoax
[58:49.000 --> 58:51.000]  You got a lot of bad
[58:51.000 --> 58:53.000]  You got a lot of bad people in the other group
[58:53.000 --> 58:55.000]  This might be today
[58:55.000 --> 58:57.000]  The first time the news networks played
[58:57.000 --> 58:59.000]  Those full remarks in their context
[58:59.000 --> 59:01.000]  The immigrant children in Cage's deception
[59:01.000 --> 59:03.000]  The desperate and bogus
[59:03.000 --> 59:05.000]  Impeachments of Donald Trump
[59:05.000 --> 59:07.000]  Or the continuing numerous cover-ups
[59:07.000 --> 59:09.000]  Of the Biden crime family
[59:09.000 --> 59:11.000]  Most of the Democrats case
[59:11.000 --> 59:13.000]  Was based on fear-mongering
[59:13.000 --> 59:15.000]  Fiction and gaslighting
[59:15.000 --> 59:17.000]  In Virginia
[59:17.000 --> 59:19.000]  We've seen these kind of
[59:19.000 --> 59:21.000]  Anti-government extremists
[59:21.000 --> 59:23.000]  Take to the streets of Charlottesville
[59:23.000 --> 59:25.000]  In 2017
[59:25.000 --> 59:27.000]  Resulting in the death of Heather Hire
[59:27.000 --> 59:29.000]  We see the same kind of
[59:31.000 --> 59:33.000]  Groups come to the forefront
[59:33.000 --> 59:35.000]  On January 6th
[59:35.000 --> 59:37.000]  I think this is an ongoing
[59:37.000 --> 59:39.000]  Threat to national security
[59:39.000 --> 59:41.000]  This is a real
[59:41.000 --> 59:43.000]  Ongoing threat
[59:43.000 --> 59:45.000]  I can tell you from our intelligence committee
[59:45.000 --> 59:47.000]  That we've seen that many of these groups
[59:47.000 --> 59:49.000]  Have connections and ties
[59:49.000 --> 59:51.000]  To anti-government extremist groups
[59:51.000 --> 59:53.000]  In Europe
[59:53.000 --> 59:55.000]  The capital staff
[59:55.000 --> 59:57.000]  It's made up
[59:57.000 --> 59:59.000]  Of many people of color
[59:59.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  Particularly men of color
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:03.000]  Who were targets
[1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:05.000]  Obviously
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  Of this racist, bigoted mob
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:09.000]  That's ridiculous
[1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:11.000]  The images of the Confederate flag
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  Of the gallows with the rope-induced
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  Typifies the horrible
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  History of lynching
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  In the south and throughout the country
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  Set deep fear
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  Among many of us
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  Workers
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  I myself witnessed
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  When I went down to
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  The capital
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  At about 730
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  About two to three men of color
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  Mopping
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  The area, the blood
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  From where the shooting
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  Occurred right outside
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  The capital
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  I want to know what's being done
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  With these workers
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  That are traumatized
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  First of all
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  Sending them down there
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  Right after
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  This horrific attack
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  Was somewhat troubling
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  To begin with
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  People who were dealing with blood
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  Were trained in biohazards
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  So they had all the prerequisite skills
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  To deal with the biohazards
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  The janitorial staff
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  And the laborers who were vacuuming
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  And cleaning up the glass
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  They
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  Volunteered
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  There is still no timetable
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  Regarding opening up the capital
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  Grounds to the taxpayer
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  But there is plenty of talk
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  About fortified plans
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  For emergency fencing
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  And the installation of...
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  Since this report came out yesterday
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  They've added more security because somebody heard
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  There might be a militia somewhere
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  Full report on infowars.com
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  And newswars.com
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  Andrew Callahan
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  The host of All Gas No Breaks
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  Is in studio straight ahead
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  Stay with us
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  The globalists want you dependent
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  They want you alone
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  They want you starving in the dark
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  That is what their entire spirit
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  Is driving for because they want total
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  Submission. When you get high quality
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  Storeable foods that last more than a decade
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  You are buying food insurance
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  That you and your family and your neighbors
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  And friends can eat
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  That is the best sponsor when it comes to
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  Storeable food out there
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  And now they are running a limited special
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  Because the ice storm is a few weeks ago
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  Of free shipping and 10% off
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  But it must end this Saturday
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  There is only a few days left
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  At infowarsstore.com
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  Their entire catalog
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  At infowarsstore.com
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  Is 10% off with free shipping
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  And with food a big part of the cost is the shipping
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  So unprecedented sale
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  It is going to end this Saturday

[1:10:26.040 --> 1:10:30.680]  That's like a 30 year old dude. That's me at 18. I wasn't, some guy took a picture of me at the
[1:10:30.680 --> 1:10:33.720]  thing. I don't know how they even finally put that in the chronicle. You look great, man.
[1:10:34.280 --> 1:10:37.080]  Why are you getting better shapes? You're just working out here.
[1:10:38.840 --> 1:10:42.440]  Nothing about me. Let's talk about your hair. That is some hair.
[1:10:43.080 --> 1:10:45.960]  Could I like rental space kind of up by your ear just right over there?
[1:10:45.960 --> 1:10:48.840]  Yeah, you can ask them a bit. All right. Do you wish you had it?
[1:10:48.840 --> 1:10:52.440]  I do. How would I look without hair? I think you look pretty good.
[1:10:52.440 --> 1:10:55.560]  Would the girls like me? You might be able to post a video online.
[1:10:56.200 --> 1:11:00.280]  You know what I mean? All right. Enough of me. We want to go deep into what you do. Deep.
[1:11:00.280 --> 1:11:05.560]  Let's go ahead and go to break down with this. This is a big foot clip. The whole episode is
[1:11:05.560 --> 1:11:09.560]  incredible. You can find it on YouTube. All gas, no breaks. Here is the big foot clip.
[1:11:12.040 --> 1:11:17.480]  This is pretty much the pheromone of a female grade A mother on their menstrual cycle.
[1:11:17.480 --> 1:11:24.360]  A female gorilla, a female orang that are on their period. And big foot is a grade A as well.
[1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:27.960]  So hopefully this will entice them or intrigue them. How did you get this?
[1:11:27.960 --> 1:11:35.720]  Actually, I got this from a guy. He, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can't tell you how you got it.
[1:11:36.840 --> 1:11:42.280]  Sasquatch pheromone chips. As far as our genetics go, we're well about 99%
[1:11:42.280 --> 1:11:45.880]  related to a chimpanzee or something like that. It's not too far off to say that we
[1:11:45.880 --> 1:11:51.640]  can't breed and to breed with them. There has to be hybrids in order for their species
[1:11:51.640 --> 1:12:01.800]  to be able to thrive. Hopefully we'll get a young one coming. That's what we're looking for.
[1:12:10.440 --> 1:12:12.760]  The crazy, the craziest part about that night is so that old guy,
[1:12:12.760 --> 1:12:16.200]  like the younger guy. There's bugs everywhere. The buff younger guy,
[1:12:16.200 --> 1:12:20.520]  like he has spent his whole life trying to find big foot, never found it. The old guy
[1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:24.200]  claimed to have seen big foot and they got really pissed at each other at the end. Because
[1:12:24.200 --> 1:12:27.480]  the old guy was like, I saw him when you weren't looking. And then the guy was like, no, you
[1:12:27.480 --> 1:12:32.120]  know, I've seen the report. Usually clips are the best part. That doesn't give justice to the
[1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:37.240]  report. This is insane. The whole thing is definitely immersive. Well, I'm always being
[1:12:37.240 --> 1:12:43.000]  accused of being in the big foot. I love Joe Rogan. You know, he used to show me for two. Really? Yeah.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:48.520]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with the host of All Gas, No Breaks, Mr. Cowley,
[1:12:48.520 --> 1:12:55.480]  and I'm Alan Jones, infowars.com. Tomorrow's news today, today, today. We told you it was coming
[1:12:55.480 --> 1:13:00.760]  under the United Nations pilot program in Singapore for eight months. They've made citizens wear
[1:13:00.760 --> 1:13:05.640]  bracelets on their arms that make some social dishes and report them back to spell towers
[1:13:05.640 --> 1:13:11.320]  to track for every movement. This is for everybody. The way it gets better. Now France has programs
[1:13:11.320 --> 1:13:16.040]  in their factories, government push and sponsor to make everyone wear actual dog collars.
[1:13:16.600 --> 1:13:22.040]  Make social distance and report back to their computers. They're turning us into a commodity.
[1:13:22.040 --> 1:13:26.520]  Human animal clones have been around for 50 years. It's all being announced. They are literally
[1:13:26.520 --> 1:13:31.640]  taking over the life cycle of humans and making us obsolete and big corporations downplay that they
[1:13:31.640 --> 1:13:37.160]  own us with the gene therapy systems and patents that they produced. Do you understand? It is a
[1:13:37.160 --> 1:13:42.200]  takeover of the entire species at the genetic level. And now they're coming with dog collars
[1:13:42.200 --> 1:13:46.360]  and they're announcing in public schools in the U.S. Starting next year, it will begin.
[1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:51.320]  Did you hear me? Dog collars for your children, all based on a hoax, all based on a lie.
[1:13:51.320 --> 1:13:53.960]  Infowars continue to spread the word to fight back.
[1:13:53.960 --> 1:13:59.480]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins? Why do you have multiple
[1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:04.200]  high quality iodine? Why do you do that? Because different strokes for different folks.
[1:14:04.200 --> 1:14:08.360]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep
[1:14:08.360 --> 1:14:12.600]  earth pure crystal iodine, but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and the two
[1:14:12.600 --> 1:14:17.240]  other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine. Boom, we did it. It's popular. It's
[1:14:17.240 --> 1:14:22.200]  X3. Is it better than X2? You decide. It's different strokes for different folks. Well, now we have
[1:14:22.200 --> 1:14:28.600]  a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleep aid and that is down and out. It's
[1:14:28.600 --> 1:14:33.960]  super strong, way stronger than knockout, but they don't compete with each other. Different strokes

[1:14:48.760 --> 1:14:59.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:14:59.240 --> 1:15:13.720]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news. Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:29.560 --> 1:15:32.760]  Overkill. Enough is enough.
[1:15:37.320 --> 1:15:43.640]  Andrew Kelley is our guest. All gas, no brakes, really funny stuff. And I envy you because,
[1:15:44.200 --> 1:15:47.880]  you know, my wife's family's from Omaha and she's not against Omaha. It's a nice town,
[1:15:47.880 --> 1:15:52.600]  nice people. She's like, why do you want to do a road trip this spring to go see family instead of
[1:15:52.600 --> 1:15:56.920]  go fly there to see family with her daughter? And I said, I've only driven to the Midwest a few
[1:15:56.920 --> 1:16:02.680]  times. It's cool. There's a lot of weirdness. And no one explores that. And so you've done that.
[1:16:02.680 --> 1:16:07.080]  So let's talk about the lockdown. Your experience the last year, you've been all over the 50 states
[1:16:07.080 --> 1:16:12.920]  or I guess the 48 contiguous. You have really experienced a lot. Yeah, I guess the lockdown is
[1:16:12.920 --> 1:16:18.280]  like, I feel like there's like separate societies being created along the lines of bars being open
[1:16:18.280 --> 1:16:21.800]  and restaurants being open, especially for a young person. Like, you know, I remember like,
[1:16:21.800 --> 1:16:25.640]  you know, we'd be in Oklahoma in the middle of COVID and it'd be open and then different states
[1:16:25.640 --> 1:16:30.120]  were closed. And that leads to just like different types of social life, like less cohesive. Like
[1:16:30.120 --> 1:16:36.360]  for example, they've been having like, we went to a mud wrestling event in Missouri in the middle
[1:16:36.360 --> 1:16:39.800]  of the COVID and no one gave a shit. But then you have other places. It's just interesting to
[1:16:39.800 --> 1:16:44.920]  watch things fragment. But it really noticed the states that didn't do the lockdown on average
[1:16:44.920 --> 1:16:50.360]  had lower death rates. Interesting. I can show you the graph. Yeah, sure. They can pull it up. I
[1:16:50.360 --> 1:16:55.240]  mean, it's crazy. What do you think of Texas reopening? I mean, it's been a year, supposed to
[1:16:55.240 --> 1:16:59.640]  be 15 days to cut the curve. Remember, I was in Austin actually when the lockdown first hit. I
[1:16:59.640 --> 1:17:03.320]  was chilling here like exactly about one year ago, when all the bars officially shut down.
[1:17:03.320 --> 1:17:07.160]  And that was surreal to get on the highway. We have horrible traffic here. There was like no one.
[1:17:07.160 --> 1:17:10.840]  Yeah, I got to work in 10 minutes out of 30 minutes. Really? I remember those days. I think
[1:17:10.840 --> 1:17:13.880]  I'm going to make a video on six street this Friday or something like that. Go out at like two in the
[1:17:13.880 --> 1:17:17.400]  morning. Cause I'm sure it's going to be crazy this weekend. Like the first party weekend in
[1:17:17.400 --> 1:17:21.800]  Austin with no masks. I want to talk to people in like canvas public opinion. Well, the left
[1:17:21.800 --> 1:17:26.680]  saying, Oh, and the CDC director, she says, keep wearing your mask. So now you have them trying
[1:17:26.680 --> 1:17:30.760]  to impose on the state like, Oh, no, no, this crisis isn't over. Keep wearing your mask. Did you
[1:17:30.760 --> 1:17:38.600]  ever wear one? 95% of the time I go in, people leave me alone. And when they do, I started
[1:17:38.600 --> 1:17:41.880]  educating him and they, cause I don't get mad. They go, sir, put your mask on. Go, let me pull
[1:17:41.880 --> 1:17:45.800]  you up a statistic in a video here. Then I'd give them like a great reset video. And I, I mean,
[1:17:45.800 --> 1:17:49.640]  I do it. I'm usually go, I know who you are, Mr. Jones. I agree. I work here. They're starting
[1:17:49.640 --> 1:17:53.560]  to fire me. And I go, well, then quit. I say, leave me alone. And I just got to go do my shopping.
[1:17:53.560 --> 1:17:57.720]  My wife doesn't wear it. My three year old daughter doesn't wear it. My son doesn't wear it. My older
[1:17:57.720 --> 1:18:02.200]  daughter doesn't wear it. And so no, I was just a status thing. I like walking to a hotel, no mask.
[1:18:02.920 --> 1:18:06.760]  And almost they say nothing. I mean, also, especially if it's in Austin, like you're Alex
[1:18:06.760 --> 1:18:09.880]  Jones. So like, if you're walking around with them, well, that is part of it. When you see
[1:18:09.880 --> 1:18:13.240]  like Democrats or Trump, they're not wearing them either. It's like a status thing. Like,
[1:18:13.240 --> 1:18:17.640]  yeah, you're like, like, so it's a leadership deal. I think every number one, you know,
[1:18:17.640 --> 1:18:22.920]  they cause bacterial pneumonia. The mask, they don't work. It's all a fraud. So why do it? It's
[1:18:22.920 --> 1:18:27.320]  a sign that we're in a crisis. It's a sign that we're in an emergency. And we need to be locked
[1:18:27.320 --> 1:18:31.720]  up in our homes. Have you seen Israel, the freedom bracelets? No, it's that they make you wear a
[1:18:31.720 --> 1:18:35.720]  bracelet now when you fly back to the country, like an ankle bracelet, but it's on your arm.
[1:18:36.840 --> 1:18:40.920]  For what purpose? Just to say that you're back? Oh, just to make sure you don't leave your house
[1:18:40.920 --> 1:18:48.120]  while you're on quarantine. It's a giant exploration. So tell me what what's your big
[1:18:48.120 --> 1:18:53.960]  takeaways? What's your favorite state ever? Well, I mean, you got to take a few things
[1:18:53.960 --> 1:18:58.840]  into account. There's like the social element of the state. So if cool people live there and you
[1:18:58.840 --> 1:19:02.280]  like the bars and the scene, there's also like natural beauty. I mean, natural beauty overall
[1:19:02.280 --> 1:19:05.640]  California, you know, because I love the desert and the mountains and the beach and all that
[1:19:05.640 --> 1:19:11.240]  stuff, you can get that in one place. Florida for sure. Socially, I mean, I'm like 23. So
[1:19:11.240 --> 1:19:15.240]  you can probably imagine the kind of stuff we get into when we travel. So probably Florida,
[1:19:15.240 --> 1:19:22.440]  central Florida. I'm proud of Florida. Florida has just been screw you that has some of the
[1:19:22.440 --> 1:19:27.720]  lowest COVID numbers. There's never been COVID in Florida. I mean, I was there. We're in what
[1:19:27.720 --> 1:19:32.200]  where were we at? We're in Orlando like a month after the lockdown and it was like party every day.
[1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:39.320]  Where you headed after Austin? I'm actually not sure. I have a lot of footage to edit. So I'm
[1:19:39.320 --> 1:19:42.920]  probably just gonna, you know, what I'm thinking about doing is putting the camper shell on my
[1:19:42.920 --> 1:19:46.760]  on my truck and just doing it that way. Because the luxury of an RV is kind of getting in my head.
[1:19:46.760 --> 1:19:51.480]  I start to feel like a like aristocrat. You know what I mean? No, it's not aristocratic to have a
[1:19:51.480 --> 1:19:57.640]  little RV. No, it's 36 feet long. It's a Winnebago. Yeah, but I've got a 36 foot Winnebago. I want
[1:19:57.640 --> 1:20:01.000]  to get to my roots and just keep it a little grimy or like, is it a leading side of 36 foot
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:05.320]  Winnebago that I've rubbed on my ears? That's possibly elitist. I mean, given the scale of
[1:20:05.320 --> 1:20:10.040]  road living, like I would say the most badass thing would just be like a truck, like a camper
[1:20:10.040 --> 1:20:13.480]  shell on it. So you can just pass out in the back. No AC, take a shit in Walmart every day. I didn't
[1:20:13.480 --> 1:20:18.520]  mean to say that. Use the bathroom in Walmart every day. I think the Winnebago with the pop
[1:20:18.520 --> 1:20:25.320]  out is relatively elitist. Yeah. Well, I mean, compared to the overpriced housing, it's pretty
[1:20:25.320 --> 1:20:29.960]  good thing to live in. Austin is insanely expensive right now. Everyone's in California's
[1:20:29.960 --> 1:20:35.960]  movie. That's become LA. Is it full blown LA or is it? I knew I was in LA last week. When I'm
[1:20:35.960 --> 1:20:41.480]  driving home, I look over and Joe Rogan is in his truck right next to me and I look at him
[1:20:41.480 --> 1:20:44.680]  and I roll the window down and wave at him and he doesn't recognize me. He gets mad, rolls his
[1:20:44.680 --> 1:20:49.800]  window up. I call him and he goes, hey, it's me. He goes, oh, hey, we started talking.
[1:20:49.800 --> 1:20:55.080]  But I mean, that's how crazy it is. Like Joe Rogan, I saw a couple other movie stars last week.
[1:20:55.080 --> 1:21:00.040]  Who do you see? I don't want to get into it. They live by me, but I mean, there's a lot of them here.
[1:21:00.040 --> 1:21:05.480]  Yeah. I mean, it's like LA now and it's just, they're here to hide. I get it. I just don't want
[1:21:05.480 --> 1:21:11.560]  them to bring their LA here. But Joe wants to get away from it. Hasn't Austin always been liberal?
[1:21:11.560 --> 1:21:16.680]  Like Austin's like a blue dot in Texas, right? Yeah, but now Austin's like a California toilet.
[1:21:17.560 --> 1:21:22.520]  It's just all the bad California stuff. They got Dallas, they got almost that LA,
[1:21:22.520 --> 1:21:26.840]  they got Austin, they got Houston, they got San Antonio. I mean, we're going blue brother.
[1:21:26.840 --> 1:21:33.000]  Do you think they're going to go to Texas? California used to be red as blood.
[1:21:33.720 --> 1:21:37.080]  Do you think all these like transplants will move back to California after the
[1:21:37.080 --> 1:21:39.640]  country opens back up? Or do you think it's like, are they just here to like
[1:21:39.640 --> 1:21:43.000]  blow off some steam and not be in the lockdown society or do you think?
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:45.320]  Oh yeah. California will come back in 20 years.
[1:21:45.320 --> 1:21:46.440]  You think it'll take that long?
[1:21:46.440 --> 1:21:49.880]  Well, here's the other empty California in New York out for the migrants
[1:21:49.880 --> 1:21:52.680]  who then politicize that they didn't have to invade the rest of the country.
[1:21:52.680 --> 1:21:55.080]  Some of them against the migrants, but they're being politically brainwashed,
[1:21:55.080 --> 1:21:56.360]  politically used, politically controlled.
[1:21:59.480 --> 1:22:01.880]  Thing is, I can talk a lot. I want you to talk.
[1:22:01.880 --> 1:22:03.480]  Dude, I'm more of a listener, you know what I mean?
[1:22:03.480 --> 1:22:09.080]  No, no, no, no, no. Let's go to your next clip here. Let's go to, we played Bigfoot,
[1:22:09.080 --> 1:22:12.440]  which that doesn't even do it justice folks. It's such a funny episode.
[1:22:12.440 --> 1:22:17.080]  Watch it three times and I don't watch anything three times. Area 51. Here's a quick clip from
[1:22:17.080 --> 1:22:20.200]  your Instagram. What are your thoughts on the aliens, man?
[1:22:20.200 --> 1:22:24.680]  They're here. They're here. They're here right now. They're walking among us on two legs.
[1:22:24.680 --> 1:22:28.200]  Human-like. Oh yeah. How do you spot a human alien hybrid?
[1:22:28.200 --> 1:22:31.720]  I think it's the smell. They buy acts at the grocery stores because they think that that's
[1:22:31.720 --> 1:22:36.200]  what the human teens want. The human teens, they disguise themselves as them.
[1:22:36.200 --> 1:22:39.320]  Look at this means of conveyance. Look at that right there. Is that human?
[1:22:40.120 --> 1:22:43.160]  Because if you had an alien scent about you, you would cover it with acts.
[1:22:43.160 --> 1:22:48.520]  Do you plan on rating tonight, sir? Oh, I've already been in. What was in there?
[1:22:53.080 --> 1:22:56.200]  They're in there. They're in there. Totally.
[1:22:58.920 --> 1:22:59.240]  Yes.
[1:23:01.880 --> 1:23:03.720]  Anyways, man, thanks for the interview. Good luck.
[1:23:04.600 --> 1:23:10.120]  Meanwhile, Area 51 is a toxic waste dump for like radiation and chemical weapons. They got some
[1:23:10.120 --> 1:23:14.200]  hidden skunk or explains there, but it's not even one of the most secret abasement.
[1:23:14.200 --> 1:23:16.920]  So how do you think it became the base they all obsessed with?
[1:23:16.920 --> 1:23:21.240]  There was a dude named Bob. Not Bob. There was a different guy named Glenn Campbell or
[1:23:21.240 --> 1:23:24.600]  something like that. You know that little town right there called Rachel Nevada, like 53 people.
[1:23:24.600 --> 1:23:28.680]  This guy is one of the reasons that it was popularizing culture as the alien hotspot.
[1:23:28.680 --> 1:23:32.440]  He lived there for a long time and he was a hardcore tinfoil hat alien dude.
[1:23:32.440 --> 1:23:37.560]  He published a lot of stuff about the extraterrestrial activity there and it just became
[1:23:37.560 --> 1:23:42.440]  this big tourist destination. I don't know. The original political correctness, you can't say
[1:23:42.440 --> 1:23:48.120]  the poop word, an Anglo-Faxon word, SH-T, you can say everything. Imagine the
[1:23:48.120 --> 1:23:52.200]  Norman. Your words are gross. Your words are bad. That's political correctness now.
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:58.680]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large. The population has been trained to submit,
[1:23:58.680 --> 1:24:02.200]  do what you're told, and it's all going to pass. But if you study
[1:24:02.200 --> 1:24:05.640]  authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where
[1:24:05.640 --> 1:24:10.280]  all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved.
[1:24:10.280 --> 1:24:14.760]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[1:24:14.760 --> 1:24:19.320]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third
[1:24:19.320 --> 1:24:25.640]  world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load,
[1:24:25.640 --> 1:24:30.360]  capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the
[1:24:30.360 --> 1:24:36.680]  flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and
[1:24:36.680 --> 1:24:43.000]  Klaus Schwabber saying and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:48.760]  and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[1:24:48.760 --> 1:24:52.200]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[1:24:52.920 --> 1:24:59.080]  I sell supplements for two reasons. Because they work, they're real, they're powerful,
[1:24:59.080 --> 1:25:04.600]  and because it's a giant market. But again, why is there a giant market? Because it works.
[1:25:05.320 --> 1:25:10.200]  That's why it exponentially grows. So whether it's Saupon Meadow and other key ingredients
[1:25:11.080 --> 1:25:18.360]  in our prostate formula, Prostagard, or whether it is the super high-grade or panic
[1:25:18.360 --> 1:25:23.960]  bottom of the B12 in ultra-12, or whether it's the PQQ of the CoQ-10 in DNA force,
[1:25:23.960 --> 1:25:30.840]  or the pure Deep Earth crystal iodine on the X2, these are all the very best supplements you're
[1:25:30.840 --> 1:25:36.680]  going to find in an already great market of high-quality products out there. And it funds the
[1:25:36.680 --> 1:25:40.680]  InfoWars. So even if these products weren't high-quality, which they are, you're fun in the

[1:25:51.720 --> 1:25:57.480]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first-ever Kava Kava root supplement
[1:25:57.480 --> 1:26:03.320]  that is now available at infowarstore.com. Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs
[1:26:03.320 --> 1:26:08.040]  in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific
[1:26:08.040 --> 1:26:13.880]  Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects. According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was
[1:26:13.880 --> 1:26:20.600]  given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of
[1:26:20.600 --> 1:26:26.200]  the universe. The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies
[1:26:26.200 --> 1:26:31.560]  to loosen up a little. Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious
[1:26:31.560 --> 1:26:37.960]  benefits. The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava,
[1:26:37.960 --> 1:26:43.640]  but other herbs including, but not limited to, German Kama Mill, organic Skolkapp,
[1:26:43.640 --> 1:26:49.640]  and Balarian root. We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by
[1:26:49.640 --> 1:26:52.120]  visiting infowarstore.com.
[1:27:19.640 --> 1:27:34.920]  Andrew Callahan, all gas and no brakes show, big hit. It is really the toast of the town.
[1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:41.640]  It is the what do you call up and coming when it actually comes. But that's what's happening here.
[1:27:42.280 --> 1:27:45.800]  I was just during the break getting you a LaCroix because you wanted one and then I could define
[1:27:45.800 --> 1:27:51.400]  a paper cup for you. So I could just bring it straight out of the car. It's not cold though.
[1:27:51.400 --> 1:27:54.520]  It's fine. I had to go across the warehouse and get it. No one will bring it to me for
[1:27:54.520 --> 1:27:58.360]  days. I'm not going to have the crew. I just beg and I please have it. You ask for the same.
[1:27:58.360 --> 1:28:02.440]  Now you get it. See, I get to have it. That's a hope. You get it down. Go ahead. This is a big
[1:28:02.440 --> 1:28:07.000]  moment here. I'm out of breath. I just ran like 500 yards to get this for you. There we go.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:16.040]  Now, meanwhile, I go running into the break room to try to find a paper cup and ice. I did find the ice.
[1:28:16.040 --> 1:28:21.080]  But no cup. That's okay. Because I'm going to run to the convenience store next year in the next
[1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:27.720]  break. My foot. Maybe I can get there. But I saw Cuomo crying on TV. So sorry. And it's so fake.
[1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:33.000]  He's such a thug. He's so out of control. Everybody hates him. What do you make of this Cuomo thing?
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:38.600]  What did he do again? He sent people with COVID purposely to the hospitals to kill all people
[1:28:38.600 --> 1:28:42.040]  who get a hot death number. And it turns out he's been threatening everybody, journalists,
[1:28:42.040 --> 1:28:47.720]  and sexually harassing women like Pepe Lapute. Oh, that's like the perv cartoon character.
[1:28:47.720 --> 1:28:53.400]  Yeah, it's the skunk. Yeah, no. I mean, is Cuomo crying on TV right now?
[1:28:54.840 --> 1:28:59.560]  Yeah, I think they have it queued up. Here, go ahead and roll it. Wait, is that him harassing
[1:28:59.560 --> 1:29:04.120]  someone right there? I don't know what it is. But I mean, he's a cartoon character. I don't think
[1:29:04.120 --> 1:29:08.200]  Pepe will abuse a cartoon character. It's this guy. Go ahead and roll the clip if you found it.
[1:29:08.200 --> 1:29:10.200]  He's just he's live right now in a press conference. Here it is.
[1:29:10.920 --> 1:29:22.920]  Fully on this. First, I fully support a woman's right to come forward. And I think it should be
[1:29:22.920 --> 1:29:29.800]  encouraged in every way. Now, this is this is good. I now understand
[1:29:31.240 --> 1:29:37.320]  that I acted in a way that made people feel uncomfortable.
[1:29:39.800 --> 1:29:46.440]  It was unintentional. And I truly and deeply apologize for it.
[1:29:46.440 --> 1:29:52.040]  I feel awful about it.
[1:29:53.080 --> 1:30:00.600]  That's right. And frankly, I am embarrassed by it. And that's not easy to say.
[1:30:01.480 --> 1:30:09.000]  But that's the truth. But this is what I want you to know. And I want you to know this from me
[1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:21.320]  directly. I never touched anyone inappropriately. I never touched anyone inappropriately.
[1:30:23.560 --> 1:30:31.160]  I never knew at the time that I was making anyone feel uncomfortable.
[1:30:31.160 --> 1:30:37.800]  I never knew at the time I was making anyone feel uncomfortable.
[1:30:37.800 --> 1:30:38.520]  He's a scooper.
[1:30:39.480 --> 1:30:42.360]  And that's your back. I certainly never.
[1:30:42.360 --> 1:30:43.320]  Bill Murray over there.
[1:30:44.440 --> 1:30:46.600]  I could only ever look at the people doing the sideline.
[1:30:48.200 --> 1:30:49.960]  That's enough. Hey, you know what this really is?
[1:30:51.160 --> 1:30:55.400]  This is them diverting from the 16,000 dead old people. You know that's what this is, right?
[1:30:55.400 --> 1:30:58.360]  Like they went, oh my God, we're deep trouble. We murdered all these people.
[1:30:58.360 --> 1:31:02.760]  Latissa James is investigating her. She ordered the old people to have the COVID cases put with
[1:31:02.760 --> 1:31:06.200]  them. So now this is their desperate attempt to make, oh, he's going away not for killing
[1:31:06.200 --> 1:31:10.920]  old people. He's going away for COVID. He's going to make us a Me Too stuff.
[1:31:12.040 --> 1:31:12.600]  What do you think?
[1:31:13.240 --> 1:31:17.320]  I don't know. But he seems like an inhuman on TV.
[1:31:18.360 --> 1:31:19.960]  He doesn't come off very human.
[1:31:19.960 --> 1:31:21.560]  No, like he's talking super slow.
[1:31:23.400 --> 1:31:27.400]  He was, I am very short. He sounds like a cartoon character.
[1:31:27.400 --> 1:31:30.600]  Oh, you're just talking so slow, man. It's like, I've never even talked that slow.
[1:31:30.600 --> 1:31:31.880]  And I've talked really slow before.
[1:31:32.600 --> 1:31:35.880]  Well, they're all still manipulative. They go take like NLP classes and stuff.
[1:31:36.680 --> 1:31:40.680]  And all it does is make them completely illegitimate. But hey, look at him right there.
[1:31:41.640 --> 1:31:43.160]  Is that a real picture?
[1:31:43.160 --> 1:31:47.080]  No, that's him and the new Health and Human Secretary deputy director.
[1:31:47.080 --> 1:31:47.880]  Oh, merged.
[1:31:47.880 --> 1:31:50.120]  The one that's a little obsessed with children's peepees.
[1:31:52.440 --> 1:31:54.360]  What can go wrong? You know, it's a dude in a wig.
[1:31:54.360 --> 1:31:56.920]  He says the three-year-old should have sex changes.
[1:31:57.480 --> 1:31:58.520]  Who said that?
[1:31:58.520 --> 1:32:01.720]  That dude. I mean, that I was like, that's me.
[1:32:01.720 --> 1:32:03.720]  No, that's not it. Is that you, right there?
[1:32:03.720 --> 1:32:05.720]  No. Is that Cuomo?
[1:32:05.720 --> 1:32:06.920]  He looks good. I'm not going to lie.
[1:32:07.640 --> 1:32:09.240]  Would you marry? Would you date her?
[1:32:09.240 --> 1:32:09.480]  Yeah.
[1:32:11.480 --> 1:32:11.720]  Yeah.
[1:32:14.840 --> 1:32:15.720]  Would you date him?
[1:32:15.720 --> 1:32:17.400]  Yeah, he's got power.
[1:32:18.520 --> 1:32:20.840]  Oh, really? He's the really powerful.
[1:32:20.840 --> 1:32:23.720]  Well, if you're dating a Cuomo in a blonde wig.
[1:32:23.720 --> 1:32:25.000]  Well, just dating Cuomo, period.
[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:28.680]  You have access to so many like elite networks of New York socialites.
[1:32:28.680 --> 1:32:30.200]  You can go to any restaurant you want.
[1:32:30.200 --> 1:32:32.200]  I would pay a lot to not go to those restaurants.
[1:32:32.200 --> 1:32:33.880]  You realize what mummies those people are?
[1:32:33.880 --> 1:32:34.280]  No.
[1:32:34.280 --> 1:32:35.560]  They all just like go, they all pose.
[1:32:35.560 --> 1:32:37.960]  So they go, oh, oh, oh.
[1:32:37.960 --> 1:32:38.920]  They're like Anderson Cooper.
[1:32:38.920 --> 1:32:41.560]  All I'm like going to the rest of you go, oh, god, it's so good to be here.
[1:32:41.560 --> 1:32:43.080]  They all just go, eh, eh.
[1:32:43.080 --> 1:32:45.960]  All the time while they're eating, you realize these are the worst people on earth.
[1:32:45.960 --> 1:32:47.640]  You do not want to be anywhere near these people.
[1:32:47.640 --> 1:32:48.280]  Is that a joke?
[1:32:48.280 --> 1:32:49.720]  Who do you think is the worst living person?
[1:32:51.160 --> 1:32:51.800]  Bill Gates.
[1:32:51.800 --> 1:32:53.720]  You know, he's about as bad as he gets.
[1:32:53.720 --> 1:32:54.040]  Second.
[1:32:55.960 --> 1:32:57.480]  Anderson Cooper is pretty bad.
[1:32:57.480 --> 1:32:58.600]  Who's the best living person?
[1:33:01.720 --> 1:33:02.600]  I'd say my mama.
[1:33:03.320 --> 1:33:04.040]  Besides your mom.
[1:33:06.200 --> 1:33:06.760]  Oh, there's a lot.
[1:33:06.760 --> 1:33:07.160]  I don't know.
[1:33:07.160 --> 1:33:08.840]  There's seven billion plus souls.
[1:33:08.840 --> 1:33:09.960]  There's a lot of good people out there.
[1:33:10.600 --> 1:33:11.560]  There's a lot of good people.
[1:33:11.560 --> 1:33:13.160]  I can't judge that I'm not omnipresent.
[1:33:13.160 --> 1:33:16.280]  I just know that when I look at Bill Gates or these people,
[1:33:16.280 --> 1:33:18.440]  I mean, these are bad people.
[1:33:18.440 --> 1:33:19.160]  Yeah.
[1:33:19.160 --> 1:33:20.200]  These are not good people.
[1:33:20.200 --> 1:33:22.200]  You know, Bill Gates has a Seattle Park Service,
[1:33:22.200 --> 1:33:26.200]  built him a, like a public park in his house that is like technically built by the city,
[1:33:26.200 --> 1:33:28.120]  but that no one can go in besides him.
[1:33:28.120 --> 1:33:29.800]  He has like his own park and no one knows about it.
[1:33:30.520 --> 1:33:31.240]  I'm from Seattle.
[1:33:31.240 --> 1:33:32.040]  No, I didn't know that.
[1:33:32.040 --> 1:33:32.600]  Tell me about it.
[1:33:32.600 --> 1:33:33.560]  He's got a secret park.
[1:33:33.560 --> 1:33:37.480]  I didn't realize until recently, but like that's pretty evil.
[1:33:37.480 --> 1:33:38.040]  You know what I mean?
[1:33:38.040 --> 1:33:38.920]  Tell me about it.
[1:33:38.920 --> 1:33:42.040]  Well, he's got a park and no one knows about it.
[1:33:42.040 --> 1:33:44.920]  And that's what he likes is they want us all up streets.
[1:33:44.920 --> 1:33:45.960]  This is beautiful for him.
[1:33:45.960 --> 1:33:47.080]  Where do they want us, you think?
[1:33:47.080 --> 1:33:47.880]  Dead.
[1:33:47.880 --> 1:33:49.080]  All of us?
[1:33:49.080 --> 1:33:50.120]  All of us?
[1:33:50.120 --> 1:33:51.080]  Yeah, they want most of us dead.
[1:33:52.520 --> 1:33:55.640]  Have you ever seen his TED talk where he said we got to reduce human carbon down to zero?
[1:33:55.640 --> 1:33:57.160]  Human carbon, so that means no people.
[1:33:57.160 --> 1:33:57.800]  Yeah, no people.
[1:33:57.800 --> 1:33:58.680]  Just him?
[1:33:58.680 --> 1:33:59.800]  That's not creeper anything.
[1:33:59.800 --> 1:34:01.960]  He just runs all our health programs worldwide and everything.
[1:34:01.960 --> 1:34:06.520]  He's been kicked out of 34 countries, but yeah, he wants to also figure out old people too.
[1:34:06.520 --> 1:34:07.640]  Have you met him before?
[1:34:07.640 --> 1:34:09.240]  No, I've never met Mr. Pink sweater.
[1:34:10.280 --> 1:34:11.240]  What would you say if you met him?
[1:34:13.160 --> 1:34:14.840]  I don't, I have no desire.
[1:34:14.840 --> 1:34:17.000]  He's not of this world, my friend.
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:17.400]  He's not.
[1:34:17.400 --> 1:34:20.120]  You think he's like not biologically human?
[1:34:20.120 --> 1:34:21.400]  No, he's biologically human.
[1:34:21.400 --> 1:34:25.800]  It's, he's dimensionally overtaken.
[1:34:25.800 --> 1:34:26.840]  How many dimensions are there?
[1:34:27.560 --> 1:34:28.920]  Well, there's 12 in our analysis.
[1:34:29.640 --> 1:34:32.680]  But that's 12 of this, and obviously everything folds over itself.
[1:34:32.680 --> 1:34:33.960]  There's a lot of subdimensions.
[1:34:33.960 --> 1:34:35.160]  Which dimension are we in right now?
[1:34:37.160 --> 1:34:38.280]  Physically the third dimension.
[1:34:40.120 --> 1:34:43.720]  What, what, what, so physically, where are we spiritually?
[1:34:43.720 --> 1:34:48.600]  Well, the mathematical equations in most analysts believe the brain goes about the sixth dimension.
[1:34:50.200 --> 1:34:52.680]  What is the difference between the sixth dimension and the third dimension?
[1:34:53.640 --> 1:34:55.320]  Well, you can actually walk through the dimensions.
[1:34:55.320 --> 1:34:56.520]  It's in mainline science.
[1:34:57.160 --> 1:34:59.400]  But the sixth dimension to try to describe it
[1:35:01.160 --> 1:35:08.200]  is that you're able to basically see and understand the dimensions of anything
[1:35:08.200 --> 1:35:11.080]  to the sixth dimension in the universe you're in.
[1:35:11.080 --> 1:35:14.440]  But you can't, like, till higher dimensions start controlling those dimensions.
[1:35:15.320 --> 1:35:20.600]  And so third dimensions, this table, two-dimensionals like this paper,
[1:35:20.600 --> 1:35:22.920]  one-dimensionals, just type on it.
[1:35:22.920 --> 1:35:25.160]  And so you're like fourth dimension.
[1:35:25.160 --> 1:35:28.680]  It would just be, you know, aware of larger circumferences,
[1:35:28.680 --> 1:35:30.120]  larger systems integrate together.
[1:35:30.120 --> 1:35:31.880]  But because we're in the third dimension right now,
[1:35:31.880 --> 1:35:35.080]  physically we can't contemplate or understand what the next one would be, right?
[1:35:35.080 --> 1:35:41.400]  Exactly, because we're always in, basically, temporarily focused on the dimension we're in.
[1:35:42.600 --> 1:35:47.960]  But the system wants to keep us in the third dimension.
[1:35:49.160 --> 1:35:51.960]  And in fact, it wants to lower us in an even lower dimension.
[1:35:53.240 --> 1:35:55.640]  So like 2D, like SpongeBob?
[1:35:55.640 --> 1:35:56.200]  Yeah.
[1:35:56.200 --> 1:35:57.320]  In that episode?
[1:35:57.320 --> 1:35:58.360]  Doodle Bob, SpongeBob?
[1:35:58.360 --> 1:35:58.840]  Or it's 2D?
[1:35:58.840 --> 1:35:59.800]  I like SpongeBob, yeah.
[1:36:00.520 --> 1:36:01.320]  Really?
[1:36:01.320 --> 1:36:02.440]  Even though it's owned by Nickelodeon?
[1:36:02.440 --> 1:36:05.000]  I mean, it doesn't mean there's like broken clocks aren't right.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:08.760]  Why is it, I mean, some of the SpongeBob things funny, like grabby patties?
[1:36:08.760 --> 1:36:11.000]  You don't think there's like any programming in SpongeBob?
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:11.560]  A lot of it.
[1:36:12.200 --> 1:36:16.120]  But mainly, it's electrochemical.
[1:36:16.120 --> 1:36:18.760]  It's like it's not an overt message or some of that.
[1:36:18.760 --> 1:36:19.640]  SpongeBob?
[1:36:19.640 --> 1:36:20.600]  It's electrochemical.
[1:36:20.600 --> 1:36:21.160]  Okay.
[1:36:21.160 --> 1:36:23.000]  In that it's lowering attention spans.
[1:36:23.800 --> 1:36:26.040]  It's nonsensical, it's jumping around.
[1:36:26.040 --> 1:36:29.000]  And so for an adult brain, you get that before a smaller brain,
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:33.560]  it can cause some neural interface issues in patterns of brain growth,
[1:36:33.560 --> 1:36:36.040]  preparing the brain for other higher level programs.
[1:36:36.040 --> 1:36:39.560]  I feel like Squidward as a neighbor kind of trained us to be hostile towards our,
[1:36:39.560 --> 1:36:41.480]  the people immediately around us.
[1:36:41.480 --> 1:36:41.960]  You know what I mean?
[1:36:41.960 --> 1:36:42.440]  The idea is-
[1:36:42.440 --> 1:36:45.400]  I think that's more like a sitcom, like that's a real character exist though.
[1:36:45.400 --> 1:36:47.320]  We have a neighbor, we have a lot of neighbors that are like Squidward.
[1:36:48.120 --> 1:36:48.680]  Squidward.
[1:36:49.560 --> 1:36:51.400]  Whatever his name is, a squid guy with a big nose.
[1:36:51.400 --> 1:36:52.520]  What's the worst?
[1:36:52.520 --> 1:36:54.840]  Always upping our game at M4 Wars.
[1:36:54.840 --> 1:36:58.280]  And we brought you a new supplement, a new product that we know you're going to love,
[1:36:58.280 --> 1:36:59.800]  especially if you have trouble sleeping.

[1:37:00.920 --> 1:37:02.760]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[1:37:02.760 --> 1:37:05.720]  We mean down your bed sleeping hard throughout the night.
[1:37:05.720 --> 1:37:08.760]  It's got four milligrams of high quality melatonin.
[1:37:08.760 --> 1:37:11.320]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.
[1:37:11.320 --> 1:37:14.920]  It's got 50 milligrams of valerian root extract concentrate.
[1:37:14.920 --> 1:37:20.040]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[1:37:20.040 --> 1:37:22.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[1:37:22.600 --> 1:37:25.640]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[1:37:25.640 --> 1:37:27.960]  It's liquid, so it goes right to your body fast.
[1:37:27.960 --> 1:37:31.800]  If you take it subliminally under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off of sleep?
[1:37:31.800 --> 1:37:32.520]  It's incredible.
[1:37:32.520 --> 1:37:35.080]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.

[1:37:55.720 --> 1:37:59.400]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[1:37:59.400 --> 1:38:02.120]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[1:38:02.680 --> 1:38:06.120]  The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they can
[1:38:06.120 --> 1:38:07.080]  to shut us down.
[1:38:07.080 --> 1:38:12.200]  So please pray to keep M4Ware on the air and please support the local states you're listening to as
[1:38:12.200 --> 1:38:12.840]  well.
[1:38:12.840 --> 1:38:18.440]  At the same time, go to M4WareStore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film,
[1:38:18.440 --> 1:38:23.560]  get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[1:38:23.560 --> 1:38:25.000]  in the face of this thing.
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:27.160]  I need your help more than ever now.
[1:38:27.160 --> 1:38:31.400]  I want to keep fighting the globalist, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[1:38:31.400 --> 1:38:36.120]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can,
[1:38:36.120 --> 1:38:41.880]  and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at M4WareStore.com.
[1:38:41.880 --> 1:38:45.640]  Whether it's high quality coffee or supplements or books or films,
[1:38:45.640 --> 1:38:49.000]  all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity,
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:51.480]  all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[1:38:51.480 --> 1:38:55.480]  Thank you so much.
[1:38:55.480 --> 1:39:00.280]  We're shooting this on the evening of Monday, March 1st, 2021.
[1:39:00.280 --> 1:39:05.400]  And in just six days this Saturday, the biggest sale ever on storeable food is going to end.
[1:39:05.400 --> 1:39:07.800]  Because of the ice storms and the problems around the country,
[1:39:07.800 --> 1:39:10.520]  our big supplier, highest quality storeable food at the lowest price,
[1:39:10.520 --> 1:39:13.080]  my patriot, is giving us the best deal ever.
[1:39:13.080 --> 1:39:17.480]  Free shipping on all of their storeable food, and that's a big cost of storeable food,
[1:39:17.480 --> 1:39:21.080]  the shipping, because it weighs a lot, and 10% off on top of it.
[1:39:21.080 --> 1:39:24.040]  You won't see this deal come along for a long, long time.
[1:39:24.040 --> 1:39:27.720]  You've got until this Saturday, the 6th of March, 2021,
[1:39:27.720 --> 1:39:29.880]  and then contractually they have to end the sale,
[1:39:29.880 --> 1:39:31.400]  because they have hundreds of distributors,
[1:39:31.400 --> 1:39:33.240]  and they're getting mad that we're undercutting the price,
[1:39:33.240 --> 1:39:34.280]  and they decided to do this.
[1:39:34.280 --> 1:39:38.760]  So it's exclusively available for just a few days left at M4WareStore.com,
[1:39:38.760 --> 1:39:41.080]  or PrepareWithAlex.com takes you right to specials.
[1:39:41.080 --> 1:39:43.960]  All their food, all their packages, one month, six month a year,
[1:39:43.960 --> 1:39:45.880]  it's all at PrepareWithAlex.com.
[1:39:45.880 --> 1:39:53.880]  Take advantage of it now, and it puts you forward.
[1:39:53.880 --> 1:39:56.280]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[1:39:56.280 --> 1:39:57.160]  It's very bittersweet.
[1:39:57.960 --> 1:40:00.360]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would,
[1:40:00.920 --> 1:40:03.160]  and now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[1:40:03.160 --> 1:40:04.600]  I care about beating the new world order.
[1:40:05.160 --> 1:40:07.080]  And it's because we have so much credibility,
[1:40:07.080 --> 1:40:09.880]  they can't allow us to stay on air much longer,
[1:40:09.880 --> 1:40:12.600]  and I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us.
[1:40:12.600 --> 1:40:14.760]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on,
[1:40:14.760 --> 1:40:15.960]  but let's just say this.
[1:40:15.960 --> 1:40:17.640]  We're going to see this through to the end,
[1:40:17.640 --> 1:40:20.360]  where we'll stay on air as long as we can.
[1:40:20.360 --> 1:40:22.840]  So please pray for us, and please buy the products.
[1:40:22.840 --> 1:40:25.080]  And M4WareStore.com, they're great products,
[1:40:25.080 --> 1:40:26.600]  plus they fund the operation.
[1:40:26.600 --> 1:40:29.720]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[1:40:29.720 --> 1:40:31.720]  Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't.
[1:40:31.720 --> 1:40:35.400]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice
[1:40:35.400 --> 1:40:38.120]  when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[1:40:38.120 --> 1:40:39.880]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[1:40:39.880 --> 1:40:43.320]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us from the air.
[1:40:43.320 --> 1:40:46.520]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[1:40:46.520 --> 1:40:47.960]  Download everything we've done.
[1:40:47.960 --> 1:40:49.240]  You can find and save it,
[1:40:49.240 --> 1:40:51.400]  because who knows how long we're going to be on the air,
[1:40:51.400 --> 1:41:20.200]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever saw.
[1:41:20.200 --> 1:41:25.480]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:41:25.480 --> 1:41:42.600]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:41:42.600 --> 1:41:47.560]  Andrew Callahan is still in his destiny.
[1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:49.720]  Good to have you here, my friend.
[1:41:49.720 --> 1:41:50.760]  It's good to be here.
[1:41:50.760 --> 1:41:51.880]  I like your comedy.
[1:41:51.880 --> 1:41:52.760]  It's not comedy, though.
[1:41:52.760 --> 1:41:54.760]  You go out and find hilarious people across.
[1:41:54.760 --> 1:41:57.480]  What's your favorite hunting ground for really entertaining people?
[1:41:57.480 --> 1:41:58.520]  The Midwest, it seems.
[1:41:58.520 --> 1:41:59.000]  Florida.
[1:41:59.560 --> 1:42:00.040]  Florida.
[1:42:00.040 --> 1:42:02.840]  Yeah, every person in Florida is what they call content.
[1:42:03.640 --> 1:42:04.200]  Why is that?
[1:42:04.200 --> 1:42:05.480]  Because I like Florida more and more, man.
[1:42:05.480 --> 1:42:06.840]  They've been really fighting the tyranny.
[1:42:07.400 --> 1:42:07.640]  Yeah.
[1:42:08.680 --> 1:42:11.880]  What would you say the spirit animal Florida is?
[1:42:12.520 --> 1:42:13.720]  That's a really good question.
[1:42:13.720 --> 1:42:16.360]  I mean, spirit animal.
[1:42:16.360 --> 1:42:16.920]  I'm not sure.
[1:42:16.920 --> 1:42:20.120]  What's your star sign?
[1:42:20.120 --> 1:42:20.920]  I'm an Aquarius.
[1:42:21.800 --> 1:42:22.440]  That makes sense.
[1:42:23.320 --> 1:42:24.520]  I'm talking about Florida, though.
[1:42:24.520 --> 1:42:26.200]  What is Florida spirit animal?
[1:42:26.200 --> 1:42:28.840]  I mean, a flamingo, that's a pretty lame thing to say, though.
[1:42:29.720 --> 1:42:30.200]  Well, no.
[1:42:30.200 --> 1:42:30.920]  Is that the state bird?
[1:42:30.920 --> 1:42:31.880]  That's the state bird.
[1:42:31.880 --> 1:42:32.280]  I don't know.
[1:42:32.280 --> 1:42:33.880]  We don't care what the government came up with.
[1:42:33.880 --> 1:42:37.160]  I'm saying, what is Florida's archetype?
[1:42:37.160 --> 1:42:38.600]  What is it spirit animal?
[1:42:38.600 --> 1:42:38.920]  I don't know.
[1:42:39.640 --> 1:42:41.000]  For reference, what's your spirit animal?
[1:42:42.440 --> 1:42:44.520]  You know, I asked Joe Rogan, his, he said he doesn't have one.
[1:42:45.560 --> 1:42:46.840]  And it's not name dropping.
[1:42:46.840 --> 1:42:47.880]  I think I'm the same way.
[1:42:47.880 --> 1:42:49.560]  I don't, I don't, I don't know about spirit animal.
[1:42:50.760 --> 1:42:51.080]  I don't know.
[1:42:51.080 --> 1:42:53.480]  I'm kind of like bear like a little bit.
[1:42:53.480 --> 1:42:54.120]  I don't know.
[1:42:54.120 --> 1:42:56.200]  Definitely bear for sure.
[1:42:56.200 --> 1:42:57.160]  So what is your spirit animal?
[1:42:59.160 --> 1:42:59.800]  Polar bear.
[1:43:00.520 --> 1:43:01.160]  Polar bear.
[1:43:01.880 --> 1:43:02.520]  There you go.
[1:43:02.520 --> 1:43:03.000]  That's good.
[1:43:03.640 --> 1:43:08.360]  So you asked me and you did a really serious interview with me earlier.
[1:43:08.360 --> 1:43:08.600]  Yeah.
[1:43:08.600 --> 1:43:09.160]  Yeah.
[1:43:09.160 --> 1:43:11.400]  But for 45 months before we went live, it was very serious.
[1:43:11.960 --> 1:43:12.920]  We're not being serious right now.
[1:43:12.920 --> 1:43:14.280]  I'll be serious next hour.
[1:43:14.280 --> 1:43:18.120]  But U.S. police don't cover possible militia plot to breach Capitol Thursday.
[1:43:19.080 --> 1:43:24.280]  This is out of Tom's Herald, AP Reuters.
[1:43:24.280 --> 1:43:25.320]  Here's another one right here.
[1:43:25.320 --> 1:43:26.200]  That March 4th.
[1:43:26.200 --> 1:43:26.760]  New York Post.
[1:43:26.760 --> 1:43:27.000]  Yeah.
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:28.520]  Don't know the Q people again.
[1:43:28.520 --> 1:43:29.480]  They're not going to do it again.
[1:43:29.480 --> 1:43:31.080]  Well, I mean, no kidding.
[1:43:31.080 --> 1:43:32.520]  There's like 30,000 troops.
[1:43:32.520 --> 1:43:36.760]  But now because 8chan says he'll be inaugurated the president tomorrow,
[1:43:37.720 --> 1:43:39.560]  like 20 idiots believe it.
[1:43:39.560 --> 1:43:41.560]  Trump meaning it'll be inaugurated tomorrow.
[1:43:41.560 --> 1:43:42.440]  It's not going to happen.
[1:43:42.440 --> 1:43:44.040]  But this is an excuse for martial law.
[1:43:44.040 --> 1:43:45.160]  This is serious.
[1:43:45.160 --> 1:43:47.560]  What do you think their next prediction is going to be when that doesn't happen?
[1:43:50.440 --> 1:43:53.320]  I mean, these people cannot admit they got conned.
[1:43:53.320 --> 1:43:55.800]  I mean, this is the globalist insiders did this whole Q thing.
[1:43:55.800 --> 1:43:59.400]  I just, I'm so sad for them because so much what they talk about is real stuff.
[1:43:59.400 --> 1:44:03.720]  It's like, you know, Q exposed the new world order before Q.
[1:44:03.720 --> 1:44:04.520]  Nobody knew about it.
[1:44:05.160 --> 1:44:06.520]  And it's like, no.
[1:44:06.520 --> 1:44:08.120]  So we like wake these people up.
[1:44:08.120 --> 1:44:11.800]  But then they like just believe an 8chan board that then gives them BS.
[1:44:11.800 --> 1:44:15.480]  Have you ever considered teaming up with Antifa to like take down the deep state?
[1:44:17.640 --> 1:44:20.200]  The problem is George Soros, the deep state fund Antifa.
[1:44:20.840 --> 1:44:22.840]  Like direct deposits type stuff?
[1:44:22.840 --> 1:44:24.680]  I mean, yeah, we've got some of their documents.
[1:44:25.560 --> 1:44:27.240]  Each person just like puts like,
[1:44:27.240 --> 1:44:29.480]  No, they'll fund kind of the mothership group in each town.
[1:44:30.840 --> 1:44:34.200]  But I don't, I mean, I think some of the actual Antifa folks might be not bad people.
[1:44:34.200 --> 1:44:34.920]  They're just misled.
[1:44:34.920 --> 1:44:41.640]  But again, most of the KKK is led by feds.
[1:44:42.520 --> 1:44:46.440]  Even Texas monthly 20 years ago caught like the main KKK group in Texas was run by the feds.
[1:44:47.720 --> 1:44:49.720]  Would you consider becoming a police officer?
[1:44:50.600 --> 1:44:54.440]  You know, the system is so political now that no, I mean, it's the problem is,
[1:44:54.440 --> 1:44:57.560]  then they just get kind of not very good people to be the police now.
[1:44:58.120 --> 1:44:58.840]  Yeah.
[1:44:58.840 --> 1:45:02.200]  That's part of putting pressure on the police and to blame police for everything.
[1:45:02.200 --> 1:45:05.080]  It's going to run off good people and society basically falls apart.
[1:45:07.640 --> 1:45:10.280]  Everything the left does is to degrade society, undermine it.
[1:45:10.280 --> 1:45:11.720]  And then, oh, let's give her the police as well.
[1:45:11.720 --> 1:45:15.160]  But oh, the Democrats, they've got private bodyguards like Minneapolis,
[1:45:15.160 --> 1:45:20.120]  millions of dollars for private bodyguard 24 seven for the city council who defunded the police.
[1:45:20.120 --> 1:45:23.000]  So the sentences don't get police and they don't want you to have guns,
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:24.280]  but they have private bodyguards.
[1:45:24.280 --> 1:45:25.560]  Do you see any kind of paradox, sir?
[1:45:26.440 --> 1:45:26.680]  Yeah.
[1:45:27.560 --> 1:45:31.160]  One thing I was wondering is like, how do you know that like someone on your team
[1:45:31.160 --> 1:45:32.120]  isn't like compromised?
[1:45:32.120 --> 1:45:33.080]  Like, how do you keep?
[1:45:33.880 --> 1:45:37.240]  We've had that happen, but we're not doing anything wrong.
[1:45:37.240 --> 1:45:38.360]  So they just make lies up.
[1:45:38.360 --> 1:45:39.560]  In fact, I never got to this earlier.
[1:45:39.560 --> 1:45:42.520]  I mean, they had top trending, you know, on Twitter yesterday,
[1:45:43.240 --> 1:45:45.800]  Alex Jones secret video undercover hates Trump.
[1:45:45.800 --> 1:45:48.360]  It was a documentary I was in and it's an edit video.
[1:45:48.360 --> 1:45:50.920]  And I had the documentary right here that I'm that it's in.
[1:45:50.920 --> 1:45:53.960]  It's like on Netflix and I mean, or it's on Amazon.
[1:45:53.960 --> 1:45:55.560]  It's like a censorship documentary or something.
[1:45:55.560 --> 1:45:55.800]  Yeah.
[1:45:55.800 --> 1:45:56.040]  Yeah.
[1:45:56.040 --> 1:45:57.640]  It's you can't watch this.
[1:45:57.640 --> 1:45:59.400]  And I said what they said in the film.
[1:45:59.400 --> 1:46:02.280]  No, they just released it and said it was a secret video.
[1:46:02.280 --> 1:46:03.080]  Oh, man.
[1:46:03.080 --> 1:46:03.800]  Yeah.
[1:46:03.800 --> 1:46:06.520]  They just released it without like the articles and stuff that are in it and said,
[1:46:06.520 --> 1:46:09.720]  and they cut off like if I was playing devil's advocate or, you know,
[1:46:09.720 --> 1:46:13.080]  if I was a immoral person, I would hate Trump because I would,
[1:46:13.080 --> 1:46:14.200]  I've been through freaking hell.
[1:46:14.200 --> 1:46:15.800]  This guy's destroyed my life.
[1:46:15.800 --> 1:46:18.280]  But, but then I want to say, but I did it because it was the right thing to do.
[1:46:19.080 --> 1:46:21.560]  But they added that part out and put out Jones attacks Trump,
[1:46:21.560 --> 1:46:24.040]  hoping Trump sees that we're hoping it creates a division.
[1:46:24.040 --> 1:46:27.560]  But I mean, imagine it's a film out for a year and a half.
[1:46:27.560 --> 1:46:31.640]  And it's all over the news, trending on Twitter that secret video.
[1:46:31.640 --> 1:46:35.640]  I'm like, it's lights in a studio like this in Austin.
[1:46:35.640 --> 1:46:36.840]  And the guy's talking to me.
[1:46:36.840 --> 1:46:39.160]  And they, they, that's how down they think their audience is.
[1:46:39.160 --> 1:46:41.160]  Whenever I saw a secret video, I thought it was going to be like,
[1:46:41.160 --> 1:46:44.600]  you know, one of those like pin cameras and like someone catching you like
[1:46:44.600 --> 1:46:47.800]  slipping, but it was like completely, you know, in studio.
[1:46:47.800 --> 1:46:47.960]  Yeah.
[1:46:47.960 --> 1:46:48.920]  It's like lights are all there.
[1:46:48.920 --> 1:46:50.920]  Like, we found the, it's like, it's kind of to see it.
[1:46:50.920 --> 1:46:53.560]  And we've looked, there it is, the leaked video.
[1:46:53.560 --> 1:46:58.760]  It's all perfectly lit, you know, in a warehouse.
[1:46:58.760 --> 1:47:01.400]  It's a film released a year and a half ago.
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:03.720]  Think of that.
[1:47:04.440 --> 1:47:06.840]  And they asked, and they asked people to see it last Monday.
[1:47:08.040 --> 1:47:10.360]  Last week, sent me a, sent me an email saying,
[1:47:10.360 --> 1:47:11.480]  we have this secret video.
[1:47:11.480 --> 1:47:12.680]  And I said, I know about that.
[1:47:12.680 --> 1:47:15.400]  I said that the film, I sent them the link to this, brother.
[1:47:16.040 --> 1:47:19.000]  They knew it was fake, but still ran with it.
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  What does that say about them?
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:25.720]  You asking me?
[1:47:25.720 --> 1:47:30.120]  Oh, I mean, look, it's a film out for a year and a half that won film festival awards.
[1:47:30.680 --> 1:47:33.880]  They take a clip of it, remove the elements of it.
[1:47:33.880 --> 1:47:35.080]  Say it's undercover video.
[1:47:35.080 --> 1:47:38.600]  It's obviously high tech shot shoot with a freaking boom and everything.
[1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:41.400]  Then they turn it around and say that it's a secret.
[1:47:41.400 --> 1:47:42.360]  And then edit the video.
[1:47:42.360 --> 1:47:43.720]  So something I hate Trump.
[1:47:43.720 --> 1:47:45.480]  It's probably once your cloud, bro.
[1:47:45.480 --> 1:47:46.920]  So that's, they don't even care if it comes out.
[1:47:46.920 --> 1:47:47.400]  It's a lie.
[1:47:47.400 --> 1:47:48.600]  They just don't dismantle.
[1:47:48.600 --> 1:47:50.680]  Well, I mean, you're a hot, hot button guy.
[1:47:50.680 --> 1:47:52.920]  Like, you know, Alex Jones leaked audio.
[1:47:53.720 --> 1:47:54.680]  Boy, that's going to go.
[1:47:55.320 --> 1:47:58.440]  And by the way, people think our reviews and info wars are agree or fake.
[1:47:58.440 --> 1:48:00.120]  Most stuff's like 95%.
[1:48:00.120 --> 1:48:00.600]  Look at this.
[1:48:00.600 --> 1:48:01.080]  They hate that.
[1:48:01.080 --> 1:48:02.280]  I mean, it's not that good a movie actually,
[1:48:02.280 --> 1:48:03.880]  because they just put negative crap in there.
[1:48:03.880 --> 1:48:07.240]  Turns out there were a couple of SJWs that made the film.
[1:48:10.760 --> 1:48:11.720]  In fact, speaking of the devil,
[1:48:11.720 --> 1:48:14.200]  go ahead and play the clip from the film folks.
[1:48:14.200 --> 1:48:14.920]  And then here it is.
[1:48:14.920 --> 1:48:19.160]  Alex Jones on, on leaked video, I wish I never met Trump.
[1:48:19.160 --> 1:48:20.920]  Here's what I actually said.
[1:48:20.920 --> 1:48:22.040]  And they edited it out.
[1:48:22.040 --> 1:48:24.040]  What I said, and then edited it to be deceptive.
[1:48:24.040 --> 1:48:24.440]  Here it is.
[1:48:27.560 --> 1:48:35.320]  Part of me, the selfish part, wishes I'd never met Donald Trump.
[1:48:35.320 --> 1:48:36.360]  Fantastic business.
[1:48:36.360 --> 1:48:37.960]  I don't know if you can see that thing right up here.
[1:48:37.960 --> 1:48:38.760]  We can.
[1:48:38.760 --> 1:48:40.200]  But it's doing great business.
[1:48:40.200 --> 1:48:42.920]  I hope your audience goes out and buys it as Christmas gifts
[1:48:42.920 --> 1:48:43.640]  and everything else.
[1:48:43.640 --> 1:48:47.080]  And I just want to finish by saying your reputation is amazing.
[1:48:47.080 --> 1:48:48.680]  I will not let you down.
[1:48:48.680 --> 1:48:52.040]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[1:48:52.040 --> 1:48:53.560]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[1:48:53.560 --> 1:49:01.480]  Being sucked into that whole vortex has, it was like selling your soul.
[1:49:03.080 --> 1:49:07.720]  Everything I did, everything I was, and everything I was trying to do,
[1:49:08.680 --> 1:49:11.160]  at that point, didn't matter how diverse it was.
[1:49:11.160 --> 1:49:14.280]  It didn't matter how it was multifaceted.
[1:49:14.280 --> 1:49:16.440]  It all became that at that point.
[1:49:17.480 --> 1:49:20.200]  So Trump came to get my populist audience.
[1:49:20.200 --> 1:49:21.080]  And then he did that.
[1:49:21.080 --> 1:49:22.360]  The Democrats thought it was a threat.
[1:49:22.360 --> 1:49:23.480]  They attacked it.
[1:49:23.480 --> 1:49:25.480]  And so that I was on Trump, they would hurt him.
[1:49:25.480 --> 1:49:26.600]  It made Trump stronger.
[1:49:26.600 --> 1:49:27.640]  It made him win the election.
[1:49:28.600 --> 1:49:33.880]  And so they understand that Donald Trump is impoverished.
[1:49:34.600 --> 1:49:35.960]  And that I'm Donald Trump now.
[1:49:35.960 --> 1:49:37.960]  And it's like a ring of doom.
[1:49:37.960 --> 1:49:41.880]  We've been merged together into this thing.
[1:49:41.880 --> 1:49:43.160]  And they're obsessed with it.
[1:49:43.960 --> 1:49:51.880]  If I had a target on my back before, when I signed on to promote America's resurgence,
[1:49:52.520 --> 1:49:58.120]  to promote Donald Trump, all the attacks I'd been through before were like boot camp.
[1:49:58.840 --> 1:50:00.360]  This was the real battle.
[1:50:00.360 --> 1:50:01.800]  And that's when it got crazy.
[1:50:02.440 --> 1:50:02.760]  Okay.
[1:50:02.760 --> 1:50:06.840]  So that was trending number seven on Twitter, except it was the raw footage without music.
[1:50:06.840 --> 1:50:11.800]  And without me saying, if I was being immoral person, I would hate Donald Trump.
[1:50:11.800 --> 1:50:14.920]  They cut that out, put the part in and said it was secret video.
[1:50:14.920 --> 1:50:16.280]  Is that not incredible fraud?
[1:50:17.240 --> 1:50:17.480]  Yeah.
[1:50:17.480 --> 1:50:20.520]  I mean, if you sound the release form, what can you do?
[1:50:21.560 --> 1:50:22.760]  No, but that's what I'm saying though.
[1:50:22.760 --> 1:50:26.840]  It's like, but they put a film out with what I really said.
[1:50:26.840 --> 1:50:30.280]  And then they put out a clip edited and then like, that's the SPLC.
[1:50:31.160 --> 1:50:32.120]  That's pretty strange.
[1:50:32.120 --> 1:50:35.400]  Pretty strange choice of like, if it's not for that long,
[1:50:35.400 --> 1:50:37.960]  seems like they just like wanted some exposure.
[1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:39.080]  So just did that real quick.
[1:50:40.440 --> 1:50:43.640]  But that's what I'm saying is, I never tried to deceive my audience.
[1:50:43.640 --> 1:50:45.880]  Hell, tell them the truth is so easy to do.
[1:50:46.680 --> 1:50:51.160]  I just don't get writing that headline that it's leaked video.
[1:50:51.160 --> 1:50:52.920]  And it's obviously professionally shot.
[1:50:52.920 --> 1:50:54.600]  They did a good job shooting it.
[1:50:54.600 --> 1:50:56.200]  I just think the quote doesn't make any sense.
[1:50:56.200 --> 1:50:58.040]  Like, why would you have wished you never met Trump?
[1:50:59.160 --> 1:51:01.240]  Well, I'm saying if I was a devil's advocate, what I've gone through,
[1:51:01.240 --> 1:51:02.360]  I would wish I never met Trump.
[1:51:02.360 --> 1:51:02.600]  Right.
[1:51:02.600 --> 1:51:05.320]  But they edited it, the edited tape, I'll show it to you.
[1:51:05.320 --> 1:51:06.760]  It's like, jump, jump, jump, jump.
[1:51:06.760 --> 1:51:08.040]  But it's like, you know, I hate Trump.
[1:51:08.040 --> 1:51:12.600]  Did you support any like political candidate in the 2012 election?
[1:51:13.400 --> 1:51:14.680]  No, I thought they were both bad.
[1:51:14.680 --> 1:51:17.400]  So Trump was like the first dude that you were like, okay, this is the man.
[1:51:17.400 --> 1:51:18.440]  Well, I knew they didn't like it.
[1:51:18.440 --> 1:51:19.560]  And I knew he was a populous.
[1:51:19.560 --> 1:51:20.440]  He wasn't perfect, exactly.
[1:51:20.440 --> 1:51:21.960]  Let's do five more minutes.
[1:51:21.960 --> 1:51:26.920]  Man, All Gas, No Breaks is with us, Andrew Callahan.
[1:51:26.920 --> 1:51:29.400]  And you can just type in his name, All Gas, No Breaks.
[1:51:29.400 --> 1:51:30.920]  And you'll find all his great work.
[1:51:30.920 --> 1:51:32.120]  And we're having some fun here.
[1:51:32.120 --> 1:51:34.120]  But this guy's a great filmmaker, great researcher.
[1:51:34.120 --> 1:51:35.080]  He's got a great team.
[1:51:35.080 --> 1:51:37.560]  And then we got Steve Quell coming up and so much more.
[1:51:37.560 --> 1:51:39.640]  We'll be right back with hour number three.
[1:51:41.560 --> 1:51:45.560]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[1:51:45.560 --> 1:51:48.120]  Why do you have multiple high quality iodine?
[1:51:48.120 --> 1:51:48.920]  Why do you do that?
[1:51:48.920 --> 1:51:51.720]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[1:51:51.720 --> 1:51:53.960]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey,
[1:51:54.600 --> 1:51:57.400]  a lot of people love deep earth pure crystal iodine,
[1:51:57.400 --> 1:51:59.720]  but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine
[1:51:59.720 --> 1:52:02.920]  and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[1:52:03.480 --> 1:52:04.120]  Boom, we did it.
[1:52:04.120 --> 1:52:05.320]  It's popular at sex three.
[1:52:05.320 --> 1:52:06.600]  Is it better than the next two?
[1:52:06.600 --> 1:52:07.240]  You decide.
[1:52:07.240 --> 1:52:08.760]  It's different strokes, different folks.
[1:52:08.760 --> 1:52:14.440]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleeping.
[1:52:14.440 --> 1:52:15.880]  And that is down and out.
[1:52:15.880 --> 1:52:19.080]  It's super strong, way stronger than knock out,
[1:52:19.080 --> 1:52:20.600]  but they don't compete with each other.
[1:52:20.600 --> 1:52:23.320]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas.
[1:52:23.320 --> 1:52:27.800]  And it's 40% off out of the gates at m4store.com and free shipping.
[1:52:27.800 --> 1:52:30.200]  Secure your down and out today and while you're sleeping,
[1:52:30.200 --> 1:52:32.200]  you know you're funding the m4 at the same time.
[1:52:32.200 --> 1:52:36.360]  Down and out exclusively available at m4store.com or 40% off and free shipping.
[1:52:43.080 --> 1:52:47.560]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be,
[1:52:48.200 --> 1:52:51.320]  you have to understand that this is all a test.
[1:52:51.320 --> 1:52:56.280]  This experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning.
[1:52:56.280 --> 1:53:01.240]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension
[1:53:01.960 --> 1:53:05.560]  so we can decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to.
[1:53:06.200 --> 1:53:07.640]  And it really does come down to that.
[1:53:07.640 --> 1:53:11.080]  So as sad as things are and as evil as things are,
[1:53:11.080 --> 1:53:15.560]  look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[1:53:16.120 --> 1:53:18.920]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[1:53:19.720 --> 1:53:25.400]  God is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[1:53:25.400 --> 1:53:29.240]  And when you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture
[1:53:29.240 --> 1:53:33.080]  in Washington DC and Fauci and the mass cult,
[1:53:33.080 --> 1:53:35.320]  it's all about dominating your free will.
[1:53:35.320 --> 1:53:38.120]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad
[1:53:38.120 --> 1:53:55.800]  because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[1:54:08.120 --> 1:54:27.800]  You got to do it too though.
[1:54:29.640 --> 1:54:31.640]  Oh, I'm so scared of that bottle of Jameson's.
[1:54:31.640 --> 1:54:32.440]  You got to do it, if I'm doing it.
[1:54:32.440 --> 1:54:34.280]  It looks like mama's milk right there.
[1:54:34.280 --> 1:54:35.480]  We're in this together.
[1:54:35.480 --> 1:54:36.120]  We're in this together.
[1:54:36.120 --> 1:54:38.120]  All right, we'll just drink out the same cup.
[1:54:38.120 --> 1:54:39.480]  He wanted to drink with me.
[1:54:39.480 --> 1:54:40.760]  This is actually apple juice.
[1:54:41.400 --> 1:54:43.080]  I could not actually drink myself.
[1:54:43.080 --> 1:54:43.960]  I can't handle it.
[1:54:43.960 --> 1:54:44.520]  You can do it.
[1:54:44.520 --> 1:54:45.640]  No, I mean, let me try it.
[1:54:45.640 --> 1:54:47.160]  Let me try this to make sure it's not poison.
[1:54:48.040 --> 1:54:48.520]  No, no, no.
[1:54:48.520 --> 1:54:49.240]  I want your glass.
[1:54:49.240 --> 1:54:50.520]  I don't have a glass, son.
[1:54:50.520 --> 1:54:50.840]  Thank you.
[1:54:50.840 --> 1:54:51.640]  This is, let me see.
[1:54:51.640 --> 1:54:52.040]  This way.
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:54:57.800]  That's apple juice.
[1:54:57.800 --> 1:54:59.800]  Yeah, you go ahead and have some too.
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:03.560]  Here we go.
[1:55:03.560 --> 1:55:05.880]  I'm an emissary of the young people, listeners.
[1:55:05.880 --> 1:55:06.680]  This is what I must do.
[1:55:06.680 --> 1:55:07.800]  I was sent here to do this.
[1:55:07.800 --> 1:55:08.280]  All right.
[1:55:08.280 --> 1:55:10.280]  Jesus turned the water into wine.
[1:55:11.560 --> 1:55:13.560]  We're in the apple juice and the Jameson's.
[1:55:13.560 --> 1:55:15.320]  You may have all those fancy Jameson's,
[1:55:15.320 --> 1:55:17.560]  but you can't get past the real Jameson's.
[1:55:17.560 --> 1:55:18.840]  I didn't know there was more than one.
[1:55:18.840 --> 1:55:21.560]  The best whiskey in the galaxy is Jameson's.
[1:55:21.560 --> 1:55:22.920]  You said, what are you drinking?
[1:55:22.920 --> 1:55:24.040]  You said Jameson's son.
[1:55:24.040 --> 1:55:25.560]  Jameson's is ginger ale.
[1:55:25.560 --> 1:55:27.000]  It's as close to ecstasy as you get.
[1:55:28.280 --> 1:55:29.480]  You were taking ecstasy?
[1:55:29.480 --> 1:55:30.440]  No, never.
[1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:31.560]  Why not?
[1:55:31.560 --> 1:55:33.800]  I don't need drugs, son.
[1:55:33.800 --> 1:55:35.800]  I have to suppress my intellect.
[1:55:35.800 --> 1:55:36.760]  Yeah, because you're in Aquarius,
[1:55:36.760 --> 1:55:38.760]  so you're just pressing something all the time.
[1:55:38.760 --> 1:55:40.200]  They always think I'm on cocaine.
[1:55:40.200 --> 1:55:40.760]  I hate cocaine.
[1:55:40.760 --> 1:55:41.560]  I've done it like three times.
[1:55:41.560 --> 1:55:42.760]  I'm going to kill myself after I take it.
[1:55:42.760 --> 1:55:43.720]  It's horrible.
[1:55:43.720 --> 1:55:45.880]  I don't take speed other than coffee in the morning
[1:55:45.880 --> 1:55:47.400]  and turbo force when I need it.
[1:55:47.400 --> 1:55:50.200]  I mean, I don't take drugs.
[1:55:50.200 --> 1:55:52.760]  Alcohol, though, Jesus gave the juice.
[1:55:54.040 --> 1:55:54.520]  Come on.
[1:55:54.520 --> 1:55:55.560]  That's smoother than...
[1:55:55.560 --> 1:55:56.200]  What about ketamine?
[1:55:56.200 --> 1:55:56.920]  You ever try that?
[1:55:56.920 --> 1:55:57.560]  No, I don't like it.
[1:55:57.560 --> 1:55:58.520]  I've heard a lot about it.
[1:55:58.520 --> 1:55:59.560]  Would you like to try it?
[1:55:59.560 --> 1:56:01.560]  No, I don't like it. I've heard a lot about it.
[1:56:01.560 --> 1:56:02.360]  Would you hear about it?
[1:56:02.360 --> 1:56:03.160]  I don't know.
[1:56:03.160 --> 1:56:04.360]  People tell me about it.
[1:56:04.360 --> 1:56:05.880]  You tell me you're falling into a hole?
[1:56:06.440 --> 1:56:07.160]  K-hole, yeah.
[1:56:07.160 --> 1:56:08.200]  That doesn't sound very fun.
[1:56:08.200 --> 1:56:09.000]  It doesn't sound fun at all.
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:11.400]  You ever fallen into a hole off the Jameson before then?
[1:56:11.400 --> 1:56:13.480]  I played back in bed before.
[1:56:13.480 --> 1:56:14.680]  Kind of had the head spins a bit.
[1:56:14.680 --> 1:56:16.600]  What's the drunkenest you've ever been in your entire life?
[1:56:16.600 --> 1:56:17.240]  I don't remember.
[1:56:18.680 --> 1:56:19.880]  You never remember those times.
[1:56:20.920 --> 1:56:22.040]  Maybe someone told you.
[1:56:22.040 --> 1:56:23.880]  You have done well, Lord of the Dead.
[1:56:25.080 --> 1:56:25.960]  You're a Star Wars fan.
[1:56:26.600 --> 1:56:28.360]  I'm a fan of making fun of it, yeah.
[1:56:28.360 --> 1:56:29.640]  I mean, I like a few episodes.
[1:56:29.640 --> 1:56:30.440]  I like the original ones.
[1:56:30.440 --> 1:56:31.480]  And episode three is pretty good.
[1:56:31.480 --> 1:56:32.760]  Are we live right now?
[1:56:32.760 --> 1:56:33.560]  Yeah, we're live.
[1:56:33.560 --> 1:56:34.360]  Oh, damn.
[1:56:34.360 --> 1:56:36.440]  All these people are watching us make Jameson?
[1:56:36.440 --> 1:56:37.080]  Crazy.
[1:56:37.080 --> 1:56:37.400]  All right.
[1:56:37.400 --> 1:56:38.760]  Listen, you've done a great job.
[1:56:40.600 --> 1:56:41.800]  All gas, no brakes.
[1:56:41.800 --> 1:56:44.360]  But I thought you were coming to an all gas, no brakes episode
[1:56:44.360 --> 1:56:45.960]  ahead of the great Steve Quill about to come on.
[1:56:45.960 --> 1:56:46.680]  You're not doing that.
[1:56:46.680 --> 1:56:47.880]  You're making a big documentary.
[1:56:47.880 --> 1:56:48.440]  It's possible.
[1:56:48.440 --> 1:56:48.840]  I'm not sure.
[1:56:48.840 --> 1:56:49.480]  I haven't announced it yet.
[1:56:49.480 --> 1:56:51.400]  This is pretty fancy pants stuff you're doing.
[1:56:51.400 --> 1:56:52.280]  Very fancy pants.
[1:56:53.400 --> 1:56:53.640]  All right.
[1:56:53.640 --> 1:56:56.440]  We're going to work out as soon as I'm done talking to Steve Quill
[1:56:56.440 --> 1:56:57.480]  in about an hour.
[1:56:57.480 --> 1:56:58.680]  All right.
[1:56:58.680 --> 1:57:00.120]  So what else do you want to impart to the listeners
[1:57:00.120 --> 1:57:01.160]  as you drink that apple juice?
[1:57:01.160 --> 1:57:02.120]  Oh, basically.
[1:57:02.120 --> 1:57:03.640]  Do you like gun smoke set, folks?
[1:57:03.640 --> 1:57:05.240]  We're not drinking real Jameson, sir.
[1:57:05.240 --> 1:57:05.960]  Basically nothing.
[1:57:07.560 --> 1:57:08.760]  I'm just happy to be here.
[1:57:09.480 --> 1:57:10.680]  What did you expect, you came here?
[1:57:10.680 --> 1:57:12.200]  Is this what you're expecting?
[1:57:12.200 --> 1:57:14.840]  Uh, I didn't expect to have so much fun.
[1:57:16.040 --> 1:57:17.080]  Right at fun with Steve Quill.
[1:57:17.080 --> 1:57:18.040]  Look at him right there.
[1:57:18.040 --> 1:57:19.400]  That's powerful right there.
[1:57:19.400 --> 1:57:20.600]  That's a person?
[1:57:20.600 --> 1:57:21.160]  Steve Quill?
[1:57:21.160 --> 1:57:22.600]  That's a real person right there.
[1:57:22.600 --> 1:57:23.480]  What does Steve Quill do?
[1:57:23.480 --> 1:57:27.320]  Well, when the DMT elves take DMT, they see Steve Quill.
[1:57:27.320 --> 1:57:28.520]  What's that, Steve?
[1:57:29.480 --> 1:57:30.520]  There's Steve right there.
[1:57:31.320 --> 1:57:32.120]  What up, Steve?
[1:57:33.640 --> 1:57:34.200]  All right.
[1:57:34.200 --> 1:57:34.520]  All right.
[1:57:34.520 --> 1:57:35.080]  I love you.
[1:57:35.080 --> 1:57:36.920]  We're going to play a little promo clip when we come back.
[1:57:36.920 --> 1:57:38.440]  Steve's got a lot to cover.
[1:57:38.440 --> 1:57:40.040]  Because we like to have some fun with comedians.
[1:57:40.040 --> 1:57:41.240]  Reach out to the young kids.
[1:57:42.200 --> 1:57:43.720]  Little sport over here.
[1:57:44.360 --> 1:57:46.680]  And it was good to have you here with us.
[1:57:46.680 --> 1:57:47.720]  Say hi to all the kitties.
[1:57:47.720 --> 1:57:48.760]  I'm being sarcastic.
[1:57:49.720 --> 1:57:51.080]  Trying to sound like Judge Smales.
[1:57:51.960 --> 1:57:54.760]  You know, Danny, there's goodness and badness in the world, right?
[1:57:54.760 --> 1:57:56.760]  Yeah.
[1:57:56.760 --> 1:58:00.040]  You need to say, I want to be good.
[1:58:00.600 --> 1:58:01.640]  I want to be good.
[1:58:02.200 --> 1:58:02.600]  Good.
[1:58:03.320 --> 1:58:04.280]  Very good.
[1:58:06.120 --> 1:58:07.400]  So that's the secret.
[1:58:07.400 --> 1:58:08.280]  All right.
[1:58:08.280 --> 1:58:09.560]  This is being very good.
[1:58:09.560 --> 1:58:12.520]  Because we have a lot of really serious things to talk about with Steve Quill.
[1:58:12.520 --> 1:58:13.400]  Look at Steve Quill.
[1:58:13.400 --> 1:58:15.160]  He is very serious right now.
[1:58:15.160 --> 1:58:16.120]  I am very serious.
[1:58:16.120 --> 1:58:17.960]  Steve Quill is about to red pill the whole world.
[1:58:17.960 --> 1:58:19.720]  He's about to, he's about to black pill the whole world.
[1:58:19.720 --> 1:58:21.160]  That's daddy black pill.
[1:58:21.160 --> 1:58:23.000]  Black pill means you like hate everything, right?
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:25.480]  Well, black pill means you're, you know, you're, you're a realist.
[1:58:26.120 --> 1:58:29.560]  And in these days, you know, black pill is, black is the new red pill.
[1:58:35.160 --> 1:58:36.440]  What would you call yourself, a pink pill?
[1:58:37.160 --> 1:58:37.720]  Pink pill?
[1:58:37.720 --> 1:58:38.200]  Green pill?
[1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:39.800]  Puget out of pill?
[1:58:39.800 --> 1:58:40.760]  Green is my favorite color.
[1:58:41.640 --> 1:58:42.360]  What's the pill?
[1:58:43.320 --> 1:58:44.040]  What's the best pill?
[1:58:45.000 --> 1:58:45.560]  Jesus.
[1:58:45.560 --> 1:58:46.200]  We'll be right back.
[1:58:46.200 --> 1:58:46.680]  Stay with us.
[1:58:46.680 --> 1:58:48.920]  We'll be right back.
[1:59:16.680 --> 1:59:19.000]  50% off all of it free shipping.
[1:59:19.000 --> 1:59:21.560]  Huge deals on gravity-fed water filters.
[1:59:21.560 --> 1:59:24.280]  Amazing deals on all of our products.
[1:59:24.280 --> 1:59:25.080]  I'll be frank with you.
[1:59:25.080 --> 1:59:25.800]  Stuff's so bad.
[1:59:25.800 --> 1:59:27.000]  Tickets are still out of control.
[1:59:27.000 --> 1:59:28.520]  I'm trying to sell of everything.
[1:59:28.520 --> 1:59:32.120]  So we actually have funds inside our coffers to keep operating
[1:59:32.120 --> 1:59:33.800]  if they shut our shopping carts down.
[1:59:33.800 --> 1:59:35.720]  We are under a major globalist attack.
[1:59:35.720 --> 1:59:40.120]  Not because we're the enemy, but because we're standing between you and the globalist.
[1:59:40.120 --> 1:59:41.880]  The globalists want to bankrupt you.
[1:59:41.880 --> 1:59:43.240]  They want to enslave you.
[1:59:43.240 --> 1:59:44.680]  They want to depopulate you.
[1:59:44.680 --> 1:59:46.440]  They want to force inoculate you.
[1:59:46.440 --> 1:59:49.800]  Fund in full wars and we'll take action against them in the fight.
[1:59:55.400 --> 1:59:59.480]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[2:00:00.280 --> 2:00:02.040]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:00:02.040 --> 2:00:04.200]  All right, we had fun for an hour.
[2:00:04.200 --> 2:00:06.920]  Now we get serious with Steve Quayle.
[2:00:06.920 --> 2:00:11.800]  But first, here is Senator Cruz on the Commies.
[2:00:11.800 --> 2:00:17.000]  We are a year into a deadly pandemic that originated in Wuhan, China.
[2:00:18.200 --> 2:00:25.320]  The Chinese Communist Party censored and disappeared doctors and journalists
[2:00:25.320 --> 2:00:30.280]  who were trying to tell the truth about how the coronavirus was spreading.
[2:00:31.960 --> 2:00:36.360]  And the Chinese Communist Party lied to the world about the nature of the virus.
[2:00:36.360 --> 2:00:44.760]  Over two and a half million people worldwide have died, including over a half million Americans.
[2:00:46.200 --> 2:00:54.440]  The Chinese Communist Party's lies and censorship and propaganda didn't stop with the pandemic.
[2:00:55.720 --> 2:00:59.000]  They pervade everything the Chinese Communist Party does.
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:05.560]  Many of us are increasingly concerned that China is gaining access to American secrets
[2:01:05.560 --> 2:01:12.600]  using non-traditional, all of government or even all of nation approaches to espionage
[2:01:12.600 --> 2:01:15.000]  against the United States and our allies.
[2:01:16.200 --> 2:01:23.240]  That includes using companies like Tencent and Huawei, which masquerade as telecom companies
[2:01:24.120 --> 2:01:27.160]  when they are in fact government espionage operations.
[2:01:27.160 --> 2:01:31.720]  This is deeply troubling and dangerous.
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:39.880]  China is, in my judgment, the greatest long-term geopolitical threat to the United States
[2:01:40.280 --> 2:01:41.880]  for the next century.
[2:01:43.160 --> 2:01:49.480]  Presidents in both parties have believed for decades that the United States could somehow
[2:01:49.480 --> 2:01:54.840]  turn China from a foe to a friend through trade and diplomacy.
[2:01:54.840 --> 2:02:00.840]  Or that allowing China into rules-based institutions would turn China into a rules-based country.
[2:02:02.120 --> 2:02:05.560]  Instead, sadly, the opposite has happened.
[2:02:06.520 --> 2:02:11.400]  The United States, of course, can't sever all commerce with one of the biggest economies
[2:02:11.400 --> 2:02:25.400]  on the planet, but we must recognize China for the threat it poses to our national security.
[2:02:25.400 --> 2:02:27.400]  Well, Steve Quayle joins us.
[2:02:27.400 --> 2:02:29.400]  I really love him joining us.
[2:02:29.400 --> 2:02:31.400]  He's got some big news we're going to announce at the bottom of the hour.
[2:02:31.400 --> 2:02:39.400]  He's the best-selling author, filmmaker, original survivalist, and other than David Ike.
[2:02:39.400 --> 2:02:45.400]  The first people on a modern scale to expose the new world war.
[2:02:45.400 --> 2:02:49.400]  I mean, 30 years ago, Ike showed about 30 years ago, sort of Quayle, so he's right up there.
[2:02:49.400 --> 2:02:53.400]  It's not about status or something, but it's important to know our history and how things
[2:02:53.400 --> 2:02:55.400]  operate and who's been dead on about things.
[2:02:55.400 --> 2:02:59.400]  And Steve Quayle's right up there with only a few people.
[2:02:59.400 --> 2:03:05.400]  And so I wanted just to get into the false flag queuing on, we know it's globalist.
[2:03:05.400 --> 2:03:09.400]  There's planning to launch an attack on the Capitol tomorrow.
[2:03:09.400 --> 2:03:11.400]  That's the deep state saying that.
[2:03:11.400 --> 2:03:15.400]  Claiming Trump will be re-inaugurated tomorrow.
[2:03:15.400 --> 2:03:17.400]  We got all the news saying, oh, martial law is needed.
[2:03:17.400 --> 2:03:19.400]  Arrest all the conservatives.
[2:03:19.400 --> 2:03:23.400]  We had the FBI terrorism task force come visit us.
[2:03:23.400 --> 2:03:25.400]  And I'm not going to get any more of that.
[2:03:25.400 --> 2:03:27.400]  I showed you the card on air.
[2:03:27.400 --> 2:03:29.400]  And it's just like terrorism, give me a break.
[2:03:29.400 --> 2:03:31.400]  That's where this country is right now.
[2:03:31.400 --> 2:03:33.400]  So they're planning something big.
[2:03:33.400 --> 2:03:37.400]  Steve Quayle joins us right now to give us a big picture with all of his gravitas and energy
[2:03:37.400 --> 2:03:39.400]  and history on where he thinks we are right now.
[2:03:39.400 --> 2:03:43.400]  Steve Quayle of ginsixgiants.com and SteveQuayle.com.
[2:03:43.400 --> 2:03:45.400]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[2:03:45.400 --> 2:03:47.400]  Where are we right now, my friend?
[2:03:47.400 --> 2:03:49.400]  Well, Alex, here's the deal.
[2:03:49.400 --> 2:03:57.400]  The whole QAnon psychological operation is falling apart, yet still people want to believe
[2:03:57.400 --> 2:04:05.400]  that somehow President Trump can come back and make all things better when every single mainstream
[2:04:05.400 --> 2:04:07.400]  media outlet is against him, was against him.
[2:04:07.400 --> 2:04:09.400]  We have the Justice Department against him.
[2:04:09.400 --> 2:04:11.400]  We have the State Department against him.
[2:04:11.400 --> 2:04:15.400]  We had all the law enforcement associations.
[2:04:15.400 --> 2:04:17.400]  He's kicked off the internet.
[2:04:17.400 --> 2:04:19.400]  He's kicked off everything.
[2:04:19.400 --> 2:04:20.400]  Yep.
[2:04:20.400 --> 2:04:26.400]  And the thing is, is that, look, they're trying to make him persona non grata, a person of no status.
[2:04:26.400 --> 2:04:29.400]  And the people still don't get it.
[2:04:29.400 --> 2:04:34.400]  And I say this, Alex, Uncle Sam, you know, some people say he's on life support.
[2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:38.400]  I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, the foundations of this country are done.
[2:04:38.400 --> 2:04:46.400]  And what could 75 million people, and I say this non violently, if they had just practiced the same thing
[2:04:46.400 --> 2:04:50.400]  that Martin Luther King did, or, you know, even Gandhi?
[2:04:50.400 --> 2:04:52.400]  Now, look, here's the thing that's happening.
[2:04:52.400 --> 2:04:58.400]  The militarization of the Washington, D.C. area should tell everybody.
[2:04:58.400 --> 2:05:01.400]  The old statement, when the government fears the people, there's liberty.
[2:05:01.400 --> 2:05:04.400]  When the people fear the government, there's tyranny.
[2:05:04.400 --> 2:05:07.400]  But Alex, this is a plan to take out.
[2:05:07.400 --> 2:05:13.400]  You and I have been talking since we were on talk radio about all the global statements to depopulate the planet,
[2:05:13.400 --> 2:05:16.400]  depopulate the world, and here's what's going on.
[2:05:16.400 --> 2:05:23.400]  The transhumanists, those who think that God did a really bad job when he created mankind are going to replace us.
[2:05:23.400 --> 2:05:24.400]  We're being replaced.
[2:05:24.400 --> 2:05:28.400]  So I don't even like the word that they're just coming after 125 million people.
[2:05:28.400 --> 2:05:33.400]  These people will not rest until a quarter of a billion Americans are dead.
[2:05:33.400 --> 2:05:35.400]  That's not fear porn.
[2:05:35.400 --> 2:05:37.400]  It's not fear mongering.
[2:05:37.400 --> 2:05:38.400]  It's the D.G.O. report.
[2:05:38.400 --> 2:05:40.400]  The D.G.O. report is composed.
[2:05:40.400 --> 2:05:48.400]  And you and I have talked about it on the air, separately and together, of three different heads of three, quote, intelligence agencies
[2:05:48.400 --> 2:05:52.400]  that are feeding the information into a think tank.
[2:05:52.400 --> 2:05:58.400]  And that think tank, even the three heads, I'm told by guys in the intelligence community, aren't known to everybody else.
[2:05:58.400 --> 2:06:01.400]  The same thing that started the QAnon movement.
[2:06:01.400 --> 2:06:03.400]  Counterintelligence programming.
[2:06:03.400 --> 2:06:07.400]  What QAnon did was neutralize the Tea Party.
[2:06:07.400 --> 2:06:09.400]  It neutralized, if you will.
[2:06:09.400 --> 2:06:19.400]  The consensus of the American public to think somebody, especially a president that is so double-crossed, betrayed, given false counsel and everything else,
[2:06:19.400 --> 2:06:21.400]  that somehow he's coming back tomorrow.
[2:06:21.400 --> 2:06:23.400]  Alex, he's going to make everything better.
[2:06:23.400 --> 2:06:31.400]  And I know that that is absolutely bizarre to even embrace that thought because we're seeing the fruit of evil.
[2:06:31.400 --> 2:06:41.400]  And I say this is a final push to quote Patrick Leahy, they won't demilitarize Washington, D.C. until the First Amendment is done
[2:06:41.400 --> 2:06:43.400]  and the Second Amendment is finished.
[2:06:43.400 --> 2:06:45.400]  The right to keep bare arms.
[2:06:45.400 --> 2:06:55.400]  The globalists, the revolutionaries, the eugenicists want the United States to cease to be because we're the only thing that stands.
[2:06:55.400 --> 2:07:01.400]  And I'll say this temporarily in their path to total global destruction.
[2:07:01.400 --> 2:07:11.400]  And how do we, Alex, get across to people that they want to destroy 90 to 95% of the population and they're initiating it now?
[2:07:11.400 --> 2:07:14.400]  It doesn't get better.
[2:07:14.400 --> 2:07:16.400]  Transhumanist quest for a godlike humanity.
[2:07:16.400 --> 2:07:22.400]  The head of Moderna, the absolute most arrogant statement yesterday, in my opinion.
[2:07:22.400 --> 2:07:25.400]  He made the statement that they can do anything to the human genome.
[2:07:25.400 --> 2:07:28.400]  I've been telling people about that for 25 years.
[2:07:28.400 --> 2:07:32.400]  One of the first shows you and I did together years ago was genetic armageddon.
[2:07:32.400 --> 2:07:34.400]  Today's technology tomorrow's monsters.
[2:07:34.400 --> 2:07:45.400]  And they're turning the most sophisticated AI programs into every form of weapon system so that they can have, if you will, autonomous killing machines.
[2:07:45.400 --> 2:07:48.400]  It seems like they're launching their attack all at once.
[2:07:48.400 --> 2:07:53.400]  Were they behind schedule? Were they on schedule? It just seems so frantic and so great.
[2:07:53.400 --> 2:07:58.400]  It's fulfilling everything we warned about, but it's just so, it's so crazy.
[2:07:58.400 --> 2:08:01.400]  It seems like it's moving really fast.
[2:08:01.400 --> 2:08:04.400]  It is moving really fast. It's no longer linear.
[2:08:04.400 --> 2:08:06.400]  I think most people got to get out of their heads.
[2:08:06.400 --> 2:08:09.400]  It's all coming. They sense blood in the water.
[2:08:09.400 --> 2:08:11.400]  Unfortunately, it's ours.
[2:08:11.400 --> 2:08:13.400]  And so it's all coming at once.
[2:08:13.400 --> 2:08:15.400]  So globalists are making their big move.
[2:08:15.400 --> 2:08:18.400]  Obviously, we're talking about a global vaccine.
[2:08:18.400 --> 2:08:21.400]  And by the way, Alex, Ebola's next on the list.
[2:08:21.400 --> 2:08:25.400]  And so the thing that I want people to understand is it's no longer linear.
[2:08:25.400 --> 2:08:27.400]  Well, one thing will happen, one thing will happen.
[2:08:27.400 --> 2:08:30.400]  It's like a bomb going off, a nuclear weapon.
[2:08:30.400 --> 2:08:33.400]  It's all taking place at once.
[2:08:33.400 --> 2:08:35.400]  You'll look to the future.
[2:08:35.400 --> 2:08:37.400]  It's coming at you to destroy you.
[2:08:37.400 --> 2:08:38.400]  Look behind you.
[2:08:38.400 --> 2:08:41.400]  You see everything, borders, language, culture, as Michael Savick said.
[2:08:41.400 --> 2:08:43.400]  And our freedoms are gone.
[2:08:43.400 --> 2:08:45.400]  You can't even travel, travel past.
[2:08:45.400 --> 2:08:47.400]  A guy by the name Von Klausowitz made a statement,
[2:08:47.400 --> 2:08:49.400]  wrote a book called On War.
[2:08:49.400 --> 2:08:51.400]  People that are in the military read it.
[2:08:51.400 --> 2:08:54.400]  But he said, when goods don't cross, borders, armies do.
[2:08:54.400 --> 2:08:57.400]  And when the American people are absolutely being isolated,
[2:08:57.400 --> 2:09:00.400]  let's you take the vaccine, and let's get that clear.
[2:09:00.400 --> 2:09:02.400]  It is not a vaccine.
[2:09:02.400 --> 2:09:07.400]  It is a genetic mutagenic, meaning it produces mutants.
[2:09:07.400 --> 2:09:12.400]  It is gene therapy, but it's also the rewriting of the human genome.
[2:09:12.400 --> 2:09:14.400]  They turn us into monsters.
[2:09:14.400 --> 2:09:16.400]  Well, that's my honest question when we come back.
[2:09:16.400 --> 2:09:19.400]  Because top scientists say you should kill yourself before you take it.
[2:09:19.400 --> 2:09:20.400]  It'll mutate your genes.
[2:09:20.400 --> 2:09:21.400]  It'll kill your baby.
[2:09:21.400 --> 2:09:22.400]  It'll do all sorts.
[2:09:22.400 --> 2:09:23.400]  It's got jellyfish genes.
[2:09:23.400 --> 2:09:24.400]  The Pfizer one does.
[2:09:24.400 --> 2:09:27.400]  It's got a dead kid from 66 in him.
[2:09:27.400 --> 2:09:29.400]  I mean, obviously, this is their big plan.
[2:09:29.400 --> 2:09:32.400]  They wouldn't try something this reckless, this violent,
[2:09:32.400 --> 2:09:34.400]  unless it had some larger end game.
[2:09:34.400 --> 2:09:39.400]  We'll decipher that with Steve Quayle of SteveQuayle.com on the other side.
[2:09:39.400 --> 2:09:41.400]  I can't wait to hear what Steve has to say about this,
[2:09:41.400 --> 2:09:43.400]  because he's the first person ever to talk about all this.
[2:09:43.400 --> 2:10:12.400]  We'll be right back.
[2:10:13.400 --> 2:10:39.400]  We'll be right back.
[2:10:39.400 --> 2:11:05.400]  We'll be right back.
[2:11:05.400 --> 2:11:34.400]  We'll be right back.
[2:11:35.400 --> 2:11:54.400]  We'll be right back.
[2:12:05.400 --> 2:12:16.400]  Well, I won't back down, no I won't back down.
[2:12:16.400 --> 2:12:24.400]  You can stand me up at the gates of hell, but I won't back down.
[2:12:24.400 --> 2:12:28.400]  Gonna stand my ground.
[2:12:28.400 --> 2:12:29.400]  We'll be turned away.
[2:12:29.400 --> 2:12:37.400]  We'll be turned around, and I'll keep this world from dragging me down.
[2:12:37.400 --> 2:12:39.400]  Gonna stand my ground.
[2:12:39.400 --> 2:12:41.400]  And look what the whole COVID lockdown is about,
[2:12:41.400 --> 2:12:43.400]  bankrupting you, making you give up.
[2:12:43.400 --> 2:12:45.400]  Back down.
[2:12:45.400 --> 2:12:46.400]  This is just breaking.
[2:12:46.400 --> 2:12:48.400]  Steve Quayle's with us right now on the On Scones Show.
[2:12:48.400 --> 2:12:51.400]  CBS News stimulus checks should continue until COVID-19.
[2:12:51.400 --> 2:12:52.400]  His history.
[2:12:52.400 --> 2:12:58.400]  Senator Biden says a letter from Senators saying they want universal basic income to start now.
[2:12:58.400 --> 2:13:00.400]  Here's the U.S. Senate letter.
[2:13:00.400 --> 2:13:04.400]  It is now official universal income.
[2:13:04.400 --> 2:13:05.400]  Oh, sounds great.
[2:13:05.400 --> 2:13:06.400]  Don't have to work.
[2:13:06.400 --> 2:13:07.400]  You've got to take the vaccine.
[2:13:07.400 --> 2:13:08.400]  You've got to do what we have to say.
[2:13:08.400 --> 2:13:10.400]  Incredible.
[2:13:10.400 --> 2:13:16.400]  Lawyers prepare second round of Nuremberg trials to prosecute all who perpetrated the global coronavirus scam.
[2:13:16.400 --> 2:13:17.400]  That's more like it.
[2:13:17.400 --> 2:13:20.400]  Going back to Steve Quayle, author, researcher, filmmaker.
[2:13:20.400 --> 2:13:22.400]  Steve, you were getting into mRNA.
[2:13:22.400 --> 2:13:24.400]  What's happening this point in history?
[2:13:24.400 --> 2:13:27.400]  Why they're accelerating so fast?
[2:13:27.400 --> 2:13:34.400]  Well, they're accelerating because, again, the plan is the global depopulation of the world's human beings.
[2:13:34.400 --> 2:13:39.400]  Now, look, China thinks they're going to come up on top of this as the dragon masters.
[2:13:39.400 --> 2:13:43.400]  And they literally consider themselves in their ancient history as children of a dragon.
[2:13:43.400 --> 2:13:45.400]  Well, here's what's going on, Alex.
[2:13:45.400 --> 2:13:49.400]  Now we're hearing about spontaneous abortions, pregnant women.
[2:13:49.400 --> 2:13:54.400]  That's part of the plan to kill off the human reproduction.
[2:13:54.400 --> 2:13:57.400]  What will be behind it is a satanic plan to kill all humanity.
[2:13:57.400 --> 2:14:08.400]  And even the technocrats and the technologically decadent people that are with Lucifer are doing everything they can to accelerate this because they know their time is short.
[2:14:08.400 --> 2:14:13.400]  You know, Z is rising, you know, his post-COVID ascent.
[2:14:13.400 --> 2:14:17.400]  I like what Ted Cruz said, but I would challenge the amount of people dead.
[2:14:17.400 --> 2:14:21.400]  We got information out of China in the first couple months.
[2:14:21.400 --> 2:14:26.400]  People who gave the information were murdered of tens of millions of Chinese.
[2:14:26.400 --> 2:14:31.400]  You cannot take the mathematical probability, apply it to the population of China,
[2:14:31.400 --> 2:14:39.400]  and their habits and everything come up with these fake and phony death numbers.
[2:14:39.400 --> 2:14:40.400]  They just don't match.
[2:14:40.400 --> 2:14:41.400]  And then we see the flu.
[2:14:41.400 --> 2:14:43.400]  The flu in the United States always went away.
[2:14:43.400 --> 2:14:48.400]  Gee, everything that was, if you got shot in the head, you died of COVID-19.
[2:14:48.400 --> 2:14:55.400]  This is the biggest psychological, world terror operation ever undertaken.
[2:14:55.400 --> 2:14:58.400]  And what it's done, you just said it, it's killed.
[2:14:58.400 --> 2:15:00.400]  It's killed grand prize.
[2:15:00.400 --> 2:15:07.400]  It's killed the, what, middle class people.
[2:15:07.400 --> 2:15:15.400]  It's absolutely causing the distortion, the breakdown, divorce, and the families.
[2:15:15.400 --> 2:15:16.400]  It's isolated.
[2:15:16.400 --> 2:15:24.400]  By the way, in ancient Arab worlds long before Islam, the mask was a sign of not only submission,
[2:15:24.400 --> 2:15:27.400]  but it broke the person's spirit.
[2:15:27.400 --> 2:15:30.400]  It absolutely was designed to isolate.
[2:15:30.400 --> 2:15:36.400]  The social isolation, and I'm on record saying, you know this, screw quarantine.
[2:15:36.400 --> 2:15:45.400]  Quarantine is the most sinister wickedness, a sinister and wicked application of solitary confinement.
[2:15:45.400 --> 2:15:47.400]  People have got to wake up.
[2:15:47.400 --> 2:15:54.400]  There is no white horse coming to you tomorrow on, you know, to save, to take over, to restore Donald Trump.
[2:15:54.400 --> 2:15:59.400]  Hey, Alex, if Donald Trump was restored, what could he do this time that he couldn't do last time?
[2:15:59.400 --> 2:16:05.400]  Because everybody who hates him, who worked to kill him, who want him dead, where are they?
[2:16:05.400 --> 2:16:07.400]  They're still in power.
[2:16:07.400 --> 2:16:10.400]  You cannot play the game.
[2:16:10.400 --> 2:16:11.400]  And let's be clear.
[2:16:11.400 --> 2:16:12.400]  I want to interrupt you because you're still on target.
[2:16:12.400 --> 2:16:15.400]  We're not saying Trump isn't good or powerful or great.
[2:16:15.400 --> 2:16:16.400]  We have to stand up.
[2:16:16.400 --> 2:16:17.400]  We have to say no.
[2:16:17.400 --> 2:16:23.400]  We can't just think he's going to do it all when the same swamp that blocked him is still there.
[2:16:23.400 --> 2:16:24.400]  Absolutely.
[2:16:24.400 --> 2:16:31.400]  You can't hire alligators and then put the alligators in charge of coming up with alligator,
[2:16:31.400 --> 2:16:34.400]  cowboy boots, belts, and whatever else.
[2:16:34.400 --> 2:16:35.400]  You cannot.
[2:16:35.400 --> 2:16:36.400]  And this is the thing.
[2:16:36.400 --> 2:16:39.400]  This is not anti-Trump.
[2:16:39.400 --> 2:16:42.400]  This is saying what changed?
[2:16:42.400 --> 2:16:43.400]  It's only got to work.
[2:16:43.400 --> 2:16:44.400]  This is realist.
[2:16:44.400 --> 2:16:45.400]  This is victory.
[2:16:45.400 --> 2:16:47.400]  Realism is victory.
[2:16:47.400 --> 2:16:48.400]  Being honest is victory.
[2:16:48.400 --> 2:16:51.400]  Assessing the problem is victory.
[2:16:51.400 --> 2:16:59.400]  But until you assess the problem accurately, you cannot count or you cannot come up with a countermeasure.
[2:16:59.400 --> 2:17:02.400]  And for every measure, there's a countermeasure.
[2:17:02.400 --> 2:17:03.400]  So here's the deal.
[2:17:03.400 --> 2:17:05.400]  What's going to change?
[2:17:05.400 --> 2:17:06.400]  Well, nothing's going to change.
[2:17:06.400 --> 2:17:14.400]  Two anonymous was, and I'll go one step further, two anonymous was the emasculation of the American spirit.
[2:17:14.400 --> 2:17:26.400]  It was an absolute pre-position, pre-planned, basically data acquisition to find out what was on the American people's hearts.
[2:17:26.400 --> 2:17:28.400]  Now we've got 19, 20 million people.
[2:17:28.400 --> 2:17:29.400]  They're going to go homeless.
[2:17:29.400 --> 2:17:35.400]  Obviously, they're throwing out every protection they had and how, where are the jobs going to be?
[2:17:35.400 --> 2:17:40.400]  There are no jobs, Alex, because the bottom line is we're being replaced by robots.
[2:17:40.400 --> 2:17:42.400]  Well, they told us we are non-essential.
[2:17:42.400 --> 2:17:45.400]  I mean, if aliens landed and said, you're non-essential, we'd know it meant genocide.
[2:17:45.400 --> 2:17:46.400]  We fight back.
[2:17:46.400 --> 2:17:47.400]  We're like, oh, you're non-essential.
[2:17:47.400 --> 2:17:56.400]  Why are they so, why does Clauss Schwab admit no more human interaction, get rid of humans, save the earth in his statements than his surrogates all lie?
[2:17:56.400 --> 2:18:02.400]  They always metaphysically tell the truth in their white papers, but then lie in the response to us.
[2:18:02.400 --> 2:18:04.400]  What is that calculation?
[2:18:04.400 --> 2:18:10.400]  Well, the calculation is we're already so brainwashed that the truth has no effect.
[2:18:10.400 --> 2:18:13.400]  And the most dangerous thing in the world is the truth.
[2:18:13.400 --> 2:18:14.400]  No, I agree.
[2:18:14.400 --> 2:18:19.400]  But why would they be honest at the executive level, but then always their surrogates say that wasn't said?
[2:18:19.400 --> 2:18:21.400]  They would just lie at the executive.
[2:18:21.400 --> 2:18:25.400]  I think metaphysically, they have to, for those of us that are awake, they have to give us the fine print.
[2:18:25.400 --> 2:18:26.400]  They do.
[2:18:26.400 --> 2:18:37.400]  And the argument is that the devil always warns what he's going to do ahead of time in order to rub our faces in it, that look at how dumb we are.
[2:18:37.400 --> 2:18:39.400]  So yeah, that's a lesser magic.
[2:18:39.400 --> 2:18:40.400]  Explain that.
[2:18:40.400 --> 2:18:42.400]  Why does the occult love to rub our face?
[2:18:42.400 --> 2:18:46.400]  Well, because that is their way of showing they have conquered.
[2:18:46.400 --> 2:18:48.400]  And you asked me, why Carl Shaw?
[2:18:48.400 --> 2:18:50.400]  I do not believe these people are human.
[2:18:50.400 --> 2:18:51.400]  I believe, and I don't.
[2:18:51.400 --> 2:19:01.400]  I believe they are possessed by supernaturally wicked entities and we're seeing more and more display of such pride and arrogance that it doesn't matter.
[2:19:01.400 --> 2:19:06.400]  And this is the thing until the American people understand they don't think you matter.
[2:19:06.400 --> 2:19:08.400]  They want you gone.
[2:19:08.400 --> 2:19:13.400]  The flooding across the borders to displace you, the universal income.
[2:19:13.400 --> 2:19:14.400]  Oh, yeah.
[2:19:14.400 --> 2:19:18.400]  They're like communism with a black rose on the top.
[2:19:18.400 --> 2:19:23.400]  We're already seeing, Alex, the total destruction of the foundation.
[2:19:23.400 --> 2:19:25.400]  Solomon said the foundations be destroyed.
[2:19:25.400 --> 2:19:26.400]  What can the righteous do?
[2:19:26.400 --> 2:19:39.400]  So everybody's frustrated, but they're also neutralized because if they don't understand the basic premise that they want you dead, they want your family dead, they want your children dead, they want you dead.
[2:19:39.400 --> 2:19:41.400]  And that's why it's all coming.
[2:19:41.400 --> 2:19:42.400]  And we're not just saying that.
[2:19:42.400 --> 2:19:43.400]  They say they want us dead.
[2:19:43.400 --> 2:19:45.400]  I mean, we have to realize we're under attack.
[2:19:45.400 --> 2:19:48.400]  We're under attack, but we're under.
[2:19:48.400 --> 2:19:50.400]  And this is a really important thing.
[2:19:50.400 --> 2:19:52.400]  They are integrating.
[2:19:52.400 --> 2:20:02.400]  They, the globalist, the Luciferians, all of the supernaturally wicked entities are looking at human extinction, the plans for human extinction.
[2:20:02.400 --> 2:20:03.400]  Are they're going for it?
[2:20:03.400 --> 2:20:05.400]  You asked me, why is it accelerating?
[2:20:05.400 --> 2:20:10.400]  They, because they've become so bold, so brazen, and they watch.
[2:20:10.400 --> 2:20:12.400]  Basically, well, you know what they're saying to the American people?
[2:20:12.400 --> 2:20:15.400]  We got you now, there's nothing you can do.
[2:20:15.400 --> 2:20:18.400]  That's, excuse me, that's not a surrender statement.
[2:20:18.400 --> 2:20:20.400]  That is how they see us.
[2:20:20.400 --> 2:20:23.400]  And oh, by the way, it's not Alex Knight putting out fear porn.
[2:20:23.400 --> 2:20:25.400]  It's not any of us who are telling the truth.
[2:20:25.400 --> 2:20:27.400]  And we're going to be neutralized.
[2:20:27.400 --> 2:20:28.400]  You know, and I love this.
[2:20:28.400 --> 2:20:32.400]  Lee Catholic exorcists, the demon possession.
[2:20:32.400 --> 2:20:34.400]  Man, the Catholics get it.
[2:20:34.400 --> 2:20:35.400]  I'm not Catholic, by the way.
[2:20:35.400 --> 2:20:39.400]  And the evangelicals, they're just selling out to it.
[2:20:39.400 --> 2:20:43.400]  You've got 500 evangelicals, quote, I question that.
[2:20:43.400 --> 2:20:44.400]  Pastors claim that.
[2:20:44.400 --> 2:20:47.400]  Stay there, Steve Quill, right back in a few minutes.
[2:20:47.400 --> 2:20:51.400]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[2:20:51.400 --> 2:20:55.400]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass.
[2:20:55.400 --> 2:21:00.400]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point
[2:21:00.400 --> 2:21:05.400]  where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved.
[2:21:05.400 --> 2:21:09.400]  Because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[2:21:09.400 --> 2:21:14.400]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third world
[2:21:14.400 --> 2:21:20.400]  that the U.N. will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load,
[2:21:20.400 --> 2:21:25.400]  capitulate to the U.N. whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the blood
[2:21:25.400 --> 2:21:30.400]  of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate change,
[2:21:30.400 --> 2:21:33.400]  as the U.N. and Klaus Schwabber saying and Bill Gates is saying,
[2:21:33.400 --> 2:21:39.400]  but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the U.N. and Bill Gates ordered them to institute
[2:21:39.400 --> 2:21:43.400]  or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[2:21:43.400 --> 2:21:47.400]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[2:21:47.400 --> 2:21:50.400]  The globalists want you dependent. They want you alone. They want you bankrupt.
[2:21:50.400 --> 2:21:52.400]  They want you starving in the dark.
[2:21:52.400 --> 2:21:57.400]  That is what their entire spirit is driving for because they want total submission.
[2:21:57.400 --> 2:22:00.400]  When you get high-quality, storeable foods that last more than a decade,
[2:22:00.400 --> 2:22:06.400]  you are buying food insurance that you and your family and your neighbors and friends can eat.
[2:22:06.400 --> 2:22:09.400]  We have the best sponsor when it comes to storeable food out there.
[2:22:09.400 --> 2:22:13.400]  And now they're running a limited special because the ice storm is a few weeks ago,
[2:22:13.400 --> 2:22:18.400]  a free shipping and 10% off, but it must end this Saturday.
[2:22:18.400 --> 2:22:22.400]  There's only a few days left at infowarstore.com.
[2:22:22.400 --> 2:22:27.400]  Their entire catalog at infowarstore.com is 10% off with free shipping.
[2:22:27.400 --> 2:22:30.400]  And with food, a big part of the cost is the shipping.
[2:22:30.400 --> 2:22:35.400]  So, unprecedented sale, it's going to end this Saturday in just a few days.
[2:22:35.400 --> 2:22:38.400]  Infowarstore.com takes you to the main page.
[2:22:38.400 --> 2:22:43.400]  Perotalex.com takes you right to the sub page where you can order and get this food delivered to you.
[2:22:43.400 --> 2:22:46.400]  It's ready to ship to you right now and your purchase funds the infowar.
[2:22:46.400 --> 2:22:50.400]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point. It's very bittersweet.
[2:22:50.400 --> 2:22:53.400]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[2:22:53.400 --> 2:22:56.400]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[2:22:56.400 --> 2:22:58.400]  I care about beating the new world order.
[2:22:58.400 --> 2:23:02.400]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[2:23:02.400 --> 2:23:05.400]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us.
[2:23:05.400 --> 2:23:09.400]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this.
[2:23:09.400 --> 2:23:13.400]  We're going to see this through to the end where we'll stay on air as long as we can.
[2:23:13.400 --> 2:23:17.400]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at infowarstore.com.
[2:23:17.400 --> 2:23:19.400]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[2:23:19.400 --> 2:23:22.400]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[2:23:22.400 --> 2:23:24.400]  Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't.
[2:23:24.400 --> 2:23:28.400]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice
[2:23:28.400 --> 2:23:31.400]  when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[2:23:31.400 --> 2:23:33.400]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[2:23:33.400 --> 2:23:36.400]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[2:23:36.400 --> 2:23:39.400]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[2:23:39.400 --> 2:23:42.400]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it
[2:23:42.400 --> 2:23:44.400]  because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[2:23:44.400 --> 2:23:55.400]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[2:24:15.400 --> 2:24:18.400]  So we're just going to have a war, aren't we?
[2:24:18.400 --> 2:24:20.400]  Lord knows I can't change.
[2:24:20.400 --> 2:24:23.400]  You're going to fly. Crank it back up.
[2:24:23.400 --> 2:24:25.400]  You're going to fly a free bird.
[2:24:25.400 --> 2:24:30.400]  Woo!
[2:24:30.400 --> 2:24:33.400]  All right, Steve Foster with us and he wanted to come on.
[2:24:33.400 --> 2:24:35.400]  I want to get him on about globalism.
[2:24:35.400 --> 2:24:39.400]  The New World Order was coming next, but he told me about something last week
[2:24:39.400 --> 2:24:41.400]  and people always asked like, what's your sales pitch?
[2:24:41.400 --> 2:24:42.400]  My sales pitch is the truth.
[2:24:42.400 --> 2:24:44.400]  And he's like, how are you doing?
[2:24:44.400 --> 2:24:46.400]  I'm like, well, we can't ever get sponsors.
[2:24:46.400 --> 2:24:48.400]  We sell our own products.
[2:24:48.400 --> 2:24:49.400]  I want to get into survivalism.
[2:24:49.400 --> 2:24:51.400]  I want to really get people prepared.
[2:24:51.400 --> 2:24:52.400]  I want to get prepared.
[2:24:52.400 --> 2:24:54.400]  He said, what about satellite phones?
[2:24:54.400 --> 2:24:56.400]  He goes, I've had a big sponsor for years.
[2:24:56.400 --> 2:24:57.400]  It's the best deal out there.
[2:24:57.400 --> 2:24:59.400]  They want to work with you.
[2:24:59.400 --> 2:25:01.400]  And I said, well, let me pay you some of the money we make.
[2:25:01.400 --> 2:25:03.400]  No, I don't want that. I want to help you.
[2:25:03.400 --> 2:25:05.400]  So then I got in contact with the lady.
[2:25:05.400 --> 2:25:07.400]  Found out she's great company for many years.
[2:25:07.400 --> 2:25:10.400]  Then I went and looked at other deals and I found out this is amongst the best.
[2:25:10.400 --> 2:25:12.400]  It's all apples and oranges.
[2:25:12.400 --> 2:25:17.400]  A lot of places you pay $600, $1,000 or more for the phone.
[2:25:17.400 --> 2:25:20.400]  Then you pay for the minutes that go with the card.
[2:25:20.400 --> 2:25:23.400]  And it ends up costing more than what this deal is.
[2:25:23.400 --> 2:25:24.400]  So I'm doing a pitch right now.
[2:25:24.400 --> 2:25:26.400]  Quell didn't want to begin this today,
[2:25:26.400 --> 2:25:28.400]  but I'm going to go ahead and do it because I'm excited about it.
[2:25:28.400 --> 2:25:30.400]  Satellite phones used to be super expensive.
[2:25:30.400 --> 2:25:32.400]  And the price has gone down quite a bit,
[2:25:32.400 --> 2:25:34.400]  but this is one of the best deals out there.
[2:25:34.400 --> 2:25:39.400]  And then we make a small percentage off of every deal you shine up for.
[2:25:39.400 --> 2:25:41.400]  So you get a phone for free, a high-end phone.
[2:25:41.400 --> 2:25:43.400]  I looked it up. It's one of the best out there.
[2:25:43.400 --> 2:25:45.400]  And then it's a year contract,
[2:25:45.400 --> 2:25:48.400]  and then you have the minutes already on the phone.
[2:25:48.400 --> 2:25:51.400]  And if you want to get more minutes, you can do that, but it's a good deal.
[2:25:51.400 --> 2:25:53.400]  Again, it's the best deal. It's apples and oranges,
[2:25:53.400 --> 2:25:55.400]  but it's right up there as the best deals.
[2:25:55.400 --> 2:25:57.400]  It's right up there as the best deals.
[2:25:57.400 --> 2:25:59.400]  And so Steve, I want to get back to the globalist where they're going,
[2:25:59.400 --> 2:26:00.400]  what's going to happen next.
[2:26:00.400 --> 2:26:02.400]  But since you told me about this, we got in contact.
[2:26:02.400 --> 2:26:05.400]  They supported us. They bought advertising on the site.
[2:26:05.400 --> 2:26:07.400]  And they sent us a bunch of phones.
[2:26:07.400 --> 2:26:09.400]  And again, you know me, I did like a week of due diligence.
[2:26:09.400 --> 2:26:11.400]  I checked, like, this is amongst the best deals out there.
[2:26:11.400 --> 2:26:13.400]  So I figured you'd have a great deal.
[2:26:13.400 --> 2:26:16.400]  Infallwarsphone.com.
[2:26:16.400 --> 2:26:18.400]  And this is just your idea of helping us.
[2:26:18.400 --> 2:26:19.400]  I was like, hey, let me cut you in.
[2:26:19.400 --> 2:26:21.400]  Oh, no, Alex, you don't want to help you.
[2:26:21.400 --> 2:26:22.400]  So you're a great guy.
[2:26:22.400 --> 2:26:25.400]  And well, I didn't know that satellite phones had gone down to this price.
[2:26:25.400 --> 2:26:26.400]  I've got one right here.
[2:26:26.400 --> 2:26:28.400]  Again, these are amongst some of the best out there.
[2:26:28.400 --> 2:26:30.400]  A free phone, sign up for a year.
[2:26:30.400 --> 2:26:32.400]  It's like $9 a month.
[2:26:32.400 --> 2:26:34.400]  And you get all these minutes on a sat phone.
[2:26:34.400 --> 2:26:36.400]  They can't track you. They can't trace you.
[2:26:36.400 --> 2:26:37.400]  This is next level.
[2:26:37.400 --> 2:26:39.400]  And so I've got one on booting it up.
[2:26:39.400 --> 2:26:41.400]  It's got the controller.
[2:26:41.400 --> 2:26:42.400]  It's got the antennas.
[2:26:42.400 --> 2:26:43.400]  It's got everything.
[2:26:43.400 --> 2:26:46.400]  And, you know, I figured even if it wasn't the best deal,
[2:26:46.400 --> 2:26:47.400]  it funds our operation.
[2:26:47.400 --> 2:26:49.400]  I was going to do it because you recommended it.
[2:26:49.400 --> 2:26:51.400]  It's one of the best deals out there.
[2:26:51.400 --> 2:26:53.400]  So Steve, thanks for recommending this.
[2:26:53.400 --> 2:26:57.400]  And tell us, tell us about this sat phone and why it's important.
[2:26:57.400 --> 2:27:02.400]  Well, first of all, Alex, and the critical communication
[2:27:02.400 --> 2:27:05.400]  with our loved ones, with information sources,
[2:27:05.400 --> 2:27:08.400]  that's what this is all about, the sat phones.
[2:27:08.400 --> 2:27:10.400]  Media censorship is happening.
[2:27:10.400 --> 2:27:14.400]  You and I both know that corporations can't be trusted.
[2:27:14.400 --> 2:27:17.400]  Cellular phones are subject to hacking and tracking.
[2:27:17.400 --> 2:27:18.400]  And I said that way.
[2:27:18.400 --> 2:27:19.400]  When they make their big moves,
[2:27:19.400 --> 2:27:22.400]  they're going to shut off individually, patriot phones.
[2:27:22.400 --> 2:27:23.400]  Absolutely.
[2:27:23.400 --> 2:27:25.400]  And I came up with a statement.
[2:27:25.400 --> 2:27:26.400]  I stand by it.
[2:27:26.400 --> 2:27:29.400]  They want to track you, whack you, and stack you.
[2:27:29.400 --> 2:27:31.400]  Stack you is like dead bodies.
[2:27:31.400 --> 2:27:33.400]  Listen, I'm passionate about this.
[2:27:33.400 --> 2:27:37.400]  I have to know that my loved ones are alive.
[2:27:37.400 --> 2:27:39.400]  I have to know that, hey, if I need to call Alex,
[2:27:39.400 --> 2:27:41.400]  hey, if there's an operation going,
[2:27:41.400 --> 2:27:43.400]  you and I and others who are in talk radio
[2:27:43.400 --> 2:27:47.400]  will be shut down selectively at the cell phone level.
[2:27:47.400 --> 2:27:49.400]  Well, that's actually my plan to set it up
[2:27:49.400 --> 2:27:51.400]  with other people that can actually get messages,
[2:27:51.400 --> 2:27:53.400]  record it from the phone if I'm in the field
[2:27:53.400 --> 2:27:54.400]  and it still gets out.
[2:27:54.400 --> 2:27:56.400]  I mean, we're having to actually look at this, folks,
[2:27:56.400 --> 2:27:58.400]  because that's the end game we're moving into.
[2:27:58.400 --> 2:28:00.400]  We're like, as the collapse of censorship happens,
[2:28:00.400 --> 2:28:02.400]  it goes exponential now.
[2:28:02.400 --> 2:28:04.400]  Right, and here's the thing.
[2:28:04.400 --> 2:28:07.400]  I don't want to put all my eggs in a cell phone
[2:28:07.400 --> 2:28:09.400]  because, again, one thing people need to understand
[2:28:09.400 --> 2:28:10.400]  about cell phones.
[2:28:10.400 --> 2:28:13.400]  Your cell phone is not only a tracking device.
[2:28:13.400 --> 2:28:16.400]  Well, you're traveling with it from cell tower to cell tower.
[2:28:16.400 --> 2:28:19.400]  But if you have your cell phone on in the room,
[2:28:19.400 --> 2:28:22.400]  the microphone, listen, nobody knows this, Alex.
[2:28:22.400 --> 2:28:24.400]  This was told to me by a really smart scientist.
[2:28:24.400 --> 2:28:25.400]  No, you said it 20 years ago.
[2:28:25.400 --> 2:28:26.400]  It's not the class spot.
[2:28:26.400 --> 2:28:27.400]  It's actually public.
[2:28:27.400 --> 2:28:29.400]  They listen to everything they say.
[2:28:29.400 --> 2:28:31.400]  Yeah, but the thing is real quick,
[2:28:31.400 --> 2:28:33.400]  even if the phones across the room,
[2:28:33.400 --> 2:28:36.400]  they can target you with smart rounds
[2:28:36.400 --> 2:28:39.400]  because the microphone is even sensitive enough
[2:28:39.400 --> 2:28:40.400]  to pick up your heartbeat.
[2:28:40.400 --> 2:28:41.400]  Look into this.
[2:28:41.400 --> 2:28:43.400]  I had a former MI6 weapons guy on
[2:28:43.400 --> 2:28:47.400]  showing the control towers,
[2:28:47.400 --> 2:28:51.400]  the smart meters and the smart white poles.
[2:28:51.400 --> 2:28:54.400]  And he showed these little transmitters aimed at the road
[2:28:54.400 --> 2:28:56.400]  that fire radiation particle beams.
[2:28:56.400 --> 2:28:57.400]  And I showed it to an engineer in Austin.
[2:28:57.400 --> 2:28:58.400]  He said it was real.
[2:28:58.400 --> 2:29:00.400]  So what you're saying is they can weaponize
[2:29:00.400 --> 2:29:01.400]  the regular cell phones.
[2:29:01.400 --> 2:29:02.400]  Absolutely.
[2:29:02.400 --> 2:29:04.400]  And that's a really good statement.
[2:29:04.400 --> 2:29:05.400]  That's the bottom line.
[2:29:05.400 --> 2:29:07.400]  No, look, the world's in a crisis.
[2:29:07.400 --> 2:29:08.400]  Let's face it.
[2:29:08.400 --> 2:29:11.400]  And I want to stay in contact with all, you know,
[2:29:11.400 --> 2:29:14.400]  my supporters, all my people that have subscribed
[2:29:14.400 --> 2:29:16.400]  to my newsletter, but all that.
[2:29:16.400 --> 2:29:18.400]  But this is what we're also setting up from satellite.
[2:29:18.400 --> 2:29:20.400]  It'll go to ham radio operators.
[2:29:20.400 --> 2:29:22.400]  All the hands have already been talking to me,
[2:29:22.400 --> 2:29:23.400]  not all of them, but a lot of them.
[2:29:23.400 --> 2:29:26.400]  And the point is, like you said, this is the best deal.
[2:29:26.400 --> 2:29:27.400]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:29:27.400 --> 2:29:30.400]  I personally know the owners of this company.
[2:29:30.400 --> 2:29:32.400]  I've dealt with them for 10 years.
[2:29:32.400 --> 2:29:35.400]  And in addition to the satellite phone,
[2:29:35.400 --> 2:29:38.400]  Alex will be able to upload alphanumeric messages.
[2:29:38.400 --> 2:29:39.400]  It's an alphanumeric.
[2:29:39.400 --> 2:29:41.400]  You're ready this way.
[2:29:41.400 --> 2:29:43.400]  They're launching something even new.
[2:29:43.400 --> 2:29:44.400]  Tell folks about that.
[2:29:44.400 --> 2:29:45.400]  I know you're ready.
[2:29:45.400 --> 2:29:49.400]  Well, they're launching a different company,
[2:29:49.400 --> 2:29:52.400]  but there's a company that's forming, if you will,
[2:29:52.400 --> 2:29:53.400]  a satellite news network.
[2:29:53.400 --> 2:29:56.400]  It's just alphanumeric called Galileo.
[2:29:56.400 --> 2:29:59.400]  And what that's going to be is that people's
[2:29:59.400 --> 2:30:01.400]  satellite phone numbers, by the way, they're on the side of it.
[2:30:01.400 --> 2:30:03.400]  This is the simplest thing to use.
[2:30:03.400 --> 2:30:04.400]  Some people say, oh, that's too confusing.
[2:30:04.400 --> 2:30:05.400]  No.
[2:30:05.400 --> 2:30:07.400]  If you're outside, you can see the sky.
[2:30:07.400 --> 2:30:08.400]  You can make a phone.
[2:30:08.400 --> 2:30:09.400]  So here's a company, you know,
[2:30:09.400 --> 2:30:12.400]  that's going to be setting up an information source
[2:30:12.400 --> 2:30:13.400]  that's going to broadcast.
[2:30:13.400 --> 2:30:15.400]  And so if you ever need to, you know,
[2:30:15.400 --> 2:30:19.400]  and somebody's got fill up with power and emergency generator,
[2:30:19.400 --> 2:30:21.400]  you can send a message on your satellite.
[2:30:21.400 --> 2:30:23.400]  We can send mass text messages to people.
[2:30:23.400 --> 2:30:25.400]  Absolutely.
[2:30:25.400 --> 2:30:27.400]  And you go and then guess what, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:30:27.400 --> 2:30:29.400]  satellite phone to satellite phone,
[2:30:29.400 --> 2:30:31.400]  nobody can basically interfere with that.
[2:30:31.400 --> 2:30:36.400]  And the 50 mile radius, they can't track you to a pinpoint.
[2:30:36.400 --> 2:30:39.400]  So the key, the key is not only the phone,
[2:30:39.400 --> 2:30:42.400]  but being able to stay in touch with information.
[2:30:42.400 --> 2:30:44.400]  For instance, precious metal investors,
[2:30:44.400 --> 2:30:46.400]  they want to know what the spot price is.
[2:30:46.400 --> 2:30:50.400]  All information that is being kept from us
[2:30:50.400 --> 2:30:52.400]  as being censored from us,
[2:30:52.400 --> 2:30:54.400]  we want to make sure the American people
[2:30:54.400 --> 2:30:55.400]  can get that truth.
[2:30:55.400 --> 2:30:57.400]  And this is the only answer.
[2:30:57.400 --> 2:30:59.400]  And thank God their hands out there.
[2:30:59.400 --> 2:31:04.400]  God bless all you guys, shortwave transmitters, receivers.
[2:31:04.400 --> 2:31:06.400]  But this is the best deal.
[2:31:06.400 --> 2:31:08.400]  You know, here's the deal.
[2:31:08.400 --> 2:31:10.400]  We want, by the way, 150 minutes,
[2:31:10.400 --> 2:31:12.400]  and they allow you to roll your minutes.
[2:31:12.400 --> 2:31:15.400]  So if you don't use 150 minutes in February,
[2:31:15.400 --> 2:31:18.400]  you can use it in March or March now into April.
[2:31:18.400 --> 2:31:21.400]  This is, and I can say this, I have one.
[2:31:21.400 --> 2:31:23.400]  I sent my wife one of these,
[2:31:23.400 --> 2:31:26.400]  but saved her sister's life
[2:31:26.400 --> 2:31:29.400]  because they were in a really bad situation floating a river.
[2:31:29.400 --> 2:31:32.400]  She got a phone call out to me on her SAP phone,
[2:31:32.400 --> 2:31:35.400]  and I basically had airplanes in the air.
[2:31:35.400 --> 2:31:37.400]  This is the way to not just put the regular phones
[2:31:37.400 --> 2:31:38.400]  inside privacy pockets.
[2:31:38.400 --> 2:31:39.400]  This is the way to go.
[2:31:39.400 --> 2:31:40.400]  And I looked it up.
[2:31:40.400 --> 2:31:42.400]  You're like, okay, you're saying I should go with these people.
[2:31:42.400 --> 2:31:43.400]  You're not making money all the time.
[2:31:43.400 --> 2:31:44.400]  I check.
[2:31:44.400 --> 2:31:45.400]  This is one of the best deals.
[2:31:45.400 --> 2:31:47.400]  If the other best deals are $600 for a phone,
[2:31:47.400 --> 2:31:49.400]  then you still pay for the minutes on a card.
[2:31:49.400 --> 2:31:51.400]  This is free phones, sign up for a year,
[2:31:51.400 --> 2:31:53.400]  $99 a month.
[2:31:53.400 --> 2:31:54.400]  It's a great deal.
[2:31:54.400 --> 2:31:56.400]  And then you have these minutes you can roll over
[2:31:56.400 --> 2:31:59.400]  and get in the habit, folks, of using a SAP phone and explain.
[2:31:59.400 --> 2:32:02.400]  You can call people on regular phones with a SAP phone.
[2:32:02.400 --> 2:32:03.400]  Absolutely.
[2:32:03.400 --> 2:32:07.400]  And the neat thing is, is anybody who calls you on a SAP phone,
[2:32:07.400 --> 2:32:10.400]  if they initiate the call, you're not paying for it.
[2:32:10.400 --> 2:32:12.400]  That's what I want people to understand.
[2:32:12.400 --> 2:32:14.400]  I'm telling you, folks, this is an insane deal.
[2:32:14.400 --> 2:32:16.400]  I remember Steve and Steve 10 years ago talking about
[2:32:16.400 --> 2:32:17.400]  satellite phones.
[2:32:17.400 --> 2:32:18.400]  I didn't ignore it.
[2:32:18.400 --> 2:32:19.400]  I respected it.
[2:32:19.400 --> 2:32:20.400]  I was like, okay, whatever.
[2:32:20.400 --> 2:32:22.400]  But I was like, how do I get the best preparedness products?
[2:32:22.400 --> 2:32:25.400]  Because I know he's a big, famous, one of the first big
[2:32:25.400 --> 2:32:26.400]  survivalists.
[2:32:26.400 --> 2:32:28.400]  He said, SAP phones, Alex SAP phones, I'll give you the lady.
[2:32:28.400 --> 2:32:29.400]  And then we checked it.
[2:32:29.400 --> 2:32:31.400]  It's one of the best deals out there.
[2:32:31.400 --> 2:32:33.400]  Like I said, and then this supports the broadcast.
[2:32:33.400 --> 2:32:34.400]  Not much.
[2:32:34.400 --> 2:32:35.400]  It's a little bit of money.
[2:32:35.400 --> 2:32:37.400]  We get like $5 for sign up.
[2:32:37.400 --> 2:32:39.400]  And then they're doing a little bit of advertising on the website.
[2:32:39.400 --> 2:32:40.400]  But I don't care, folks.
[2:32:40.400 --> 2:32:41.400]  I've got one.
[2:32:41.400 --> 2:32:42.400]  We're starting to use it.
[2:32:42.400 --> 2:32:43.400]  It's incredible.
[2:32:43.400 --> 2:32:44.400]  It's so clear.
[2:32:44.400 --> 2:32:46.400]  And it's crazy that this is a phone that's not watching.
[2:32:46.400 --> 2:32:48.400]  This is a phone not listening to you,
[2:32:48.400 --> 2:32:50.400]  not sending cookies out, not controlling you.
[2:32:50.400 --> 2:32:52.400]  This is really a free phone.
[2:32:52.400 --> 2:32:53.400]  By free.
[2:32:53.400 --> 2:32:55.400]  I mean, it's actually in the ether.
[2:32:55.400 --> 2:32:56.400]  It's real.
[2:32:56.400 --> 2:32:57.400]  It's real.
[2:32:57.400 --> 2:33:02.400]  And the other thing is Alex, we can also, you and I can go to a push
[2:33:02.400 --> 2:33:05.400]  to talk feature and it's encrypted.
[2:33:05.400 --> 2:33:09.400]  And the bottom line is that it's pushed to talk over satellite.
[2:33:09.400 --> 2:33:13.400]  So we're in basically a satellite walkie-talkie situation.
[2:33:13.400 --> 2:33:16.400]  And for people that have loved ones who work in the city away,
[2:33:16.400 --> 2:33:18.400]  any type of natural disaster, for instance,
[2:33:18.400 --> 2:33:20.400]  the whole situation in Nashville,
[2:33:20.400 --> 2:33:22.400]  a lot of cell phones went down in Texas,
[2:33:22.400 --> 2:33:23.400]  a lot of yourself.
[2:33:23.400 --> 2:33:26.400]  Bottom line, they're going to shut the cell phone networks down.
[2:33:26.400 --> 2:33:27.400]  This is what you need to get.
[2:33:27.400 --> 2:33:31.400]  Infowarsphone.com, Infowarsphone.com.
[2:33:31.400 --> 2:33:33.400]  We should get a toll free number out as well.
[2:33:33.400 --> 2:33:34.400]  But this is just incredible.
[2:33:34.400 --> 2:33:35.400]  Everybody needs to get it.
[2:33:35.400 --> 2:33:37.400]  And it supports the broadcast.
[2:33:37.400 --> 2:33:39.400]  We get a little bit of money from each phone.
[2:33:39.400 --> 2:33:40.400]  It's just something you all need.
[2:33:40.400 --> 2:33:41.400]  And I thought it's the best deal out there.
[2:33:41.400 --> 2:33:43.400]  So I'm like, okay, I'm all for this.
[2:33:43.400 --> 2:33:44.400]  All right.
[2:33:44.400 --> 2:33:46.400]  We'll be right back.
[2:33:46.400 --> 2:33:47.400]  Listers ask me all the time,
[2:33:47.400 --> 2:33:50.400]  why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[2:33:50.400 --> 2:33:52.400]  Why do you have multiple high quality iodine?
[2:33:52.400 --> 2:33:53.400]  Why do you do that?
[2:33:53.400 --> 2:33:56.400]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[2:33:56.400 --> 2:33:58.400]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists,
[2:33:58.400 --> 2:34:02.400]  they say, hey, a lot of people love deep earth pure crystal iodine.
[2:34:02.400 --> 2:34:04.400]  But you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine
[2:34:04.400 --> 2:34:05.400]  and the two other types,
[2:34:05.400 --> 2:34:08.400]  because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[2:34:08.400 --> 2:34:09.400]  Boom, we did it.
[2:34:09.400 --> 2:34:10.400]  It's popular. It's X3.
[2:34:10.400 --> 2:34:11.400]  Is it better than X2?
[2:34:11.400 --> 2:34:12.400]  You decide.
[2:34:12.400 --> 2:34:13.400]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[2:34:13.400 --> 2:34:15.400]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out
[2:34:15.400 --> 2:34:19.400]  our very popular powdered pill sleeping.
[2:34:19.400 --> 2:34:20.400]  And that is down and out.
[2:34:20.400 --> 2:34:23.400]  It's super strong, way stronger than knocked out,
[2:34:23.400 --> 2:34:25.400]  but they don't compete with each other.
[2:34:25.400 --> 2:34:27.400]  Different strokes for different folks.
[2:34:27.400 --> 2:34:28.400]  Different formulas.
[2:34:28.400 --> 2:34:30.400]  And it's 40% off out of the gates
[2:34:30.400 --> 2:34:32.400]  at M4store.com and free shipping.
[2:34:32.400 --> 2:34:33.400]  Secure your down and out today.
[2:34:33.400 --> 2:34:34.400]  And while you're sleeping,
[2:34:34.400 --> 2:34:36.400]  you know you're funding the M4 at the same time.
[2:34:36.400 --> 2:34:38.400]  Down and out exclusively available
[2:34:38.400 --> 2:34:46.400]  at M4store.com or 40% off and free shipping.
[2:34:46.400 --> 2:34:48.400]  I don't like coming to you
[2:34:48.400 --> 2:34:50.400]  and saying this to be our last broadcast.
[2:34:50.400 --> 2:34:52.400]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years
[2:34:52.400 --> 2:34:54.400]  and only the last year or so have I said that.
[2:34:54.400 --> 2:34:55.400]  But let me tell you,
[2:34:55.400 --> 2:34:57.400]  the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[2:34:57.400 --> 2:34:59.400]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us
[2:34:59.400 --> 2:35:01.400]  and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[2:35:01.400 --> 2:35:04.400]  So please pray to keep M4s on the air
[2:35:04.400 --> 2:35:06.400]  and please support the local station
[2:35:06.400 --> 2:35:07.400]  you're listening to as well.
[2:35:07.400 --> 2:35:10.400]  At the same time, go to M4store.com
[2:35:10.400 --> 2:35:12.400]  while you still can and get a book,
[2:35:12.400 --> 2:35:14.400]  get a film, get a t-shirt,
[2:35:14.400 --> 2:35:16.400]  get some supplements because it's that money
[2:35:16.400 --> 2:35:19.400]  that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[2:35:19.400 --> 2:35:21.400]  I need your help more than ever now.
[2:35:21.400 --> 2:35:23.400]  I want to keep fighting the globalists
[2:35:23.400 --> 2:35:26.400]  but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[2:35:26.400 --> 2:35:28.400]  So pray for us, word of mouth,
[2:35:28.400 --> 2:35:30.400]  tell folks about the broadcast however you can
[2:35:30.400 --> 2:35:32.400]  and buy great products that will enrich you
[2:35:32.400 --> 2:35:36.400]  and your family's lives every day at M4store.com.
[2:35:36.400 --> 2:35:38.400]  Whether it's high-quality coffee or supplements
[2:35:38.400 --> 2:35:41.400]  or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul.
[2:35:41.400 --> 2:35:43.400]  All of it empowers humanity.
[2:35:43.400 --> 2:35:45.400]  All of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[2:35:45.400 --> 2:35:47.400]  Thank you so much.
[2:35:48.400 --> 2:35:51.400]  You cannot hide a grand assault.
[2:35:51.400 --> 2:35:54.400]  America is about to have its energy cut off.
[2:35:54.400 --> 2:35:55.400]  Its borders destroyed.
[2:35:55.400 --> 2:35:58.400]  Its dollar brought down to nothing.
[2:35:58.400 --> 2:36:01.400]  All of you that have served Satan
[2:36:01.400 --> 2:36:03.400]  believe that you are on the right team.
[2:36:03.400 --> 2:36:06.400]  You're about to find out how pathetic you are.
[2:36:06.400 --> 2:36:11.400]  So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God
[2:36:11.400 --> 2:36:13.400]  stop living in fear.
[2:36:13.400 --> 2:36:16.400]  The enemy is about to expose itself.
[2:36:16.400 --> 2:36:18.400]  The enemy can't help itself.
[2:36:18.400 --> 2:36:22.400]  The enemy comes to kill, steal and destroy.
[2:36:22.400 --> 2:36:25.400]  We sit here as good people get upset about that
[2:36:25.400 --> 2:36:27.400]  and try to stop it and we should
[2:36:27.400 --> 2:36:31.400]  but once it comes through, once it hits us,
[2:36:31.400 --> 2:36:35.400]  once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking us
[2:36:35.400 --> 2:36:38.400]  we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[2:36:38.400 --> 2:36:40.400]  So prepare yourselves, America.
[2:36:40.400 --> 2:36:43.400]  You're going under a judge but just like all the children
[2:36:43.400 --> 2:36:44.400]  that were aborted.
[2:36:44.400 --> 2:36:46.400]  This is the truth.
[2:36:46.400 --> 2:36:48.400]  This is the info-war.
[2:36:48.400 --> 2:36:51.400]  My enemies are your enemies.
[2:36:51.400 --> 2:36:53.400]  They're the globalists, third extremists.
[2:36:53.400 --> 2:36:55.400]  They are a consortium of bad scientists,
[2:36:55.400 --> 2:36:58.400]  pedophiles, control freaks, devil worshipers,
[2:36:58.400 --> 2:37:01.400]  vampires wherever you want to call them
[2:37:01.400 --> 2:37:03.400]  that are highly predatory
[2:37:03.400 --> 2:37:07.400]  and are setting up a false famous U.N. system
[2:37:07.400 --> 2:37:10.400]  of constant bombardment of propaganda, drugs
[2:37:10.400 --> 2:37:13.400]  and electromagnetic radiation
[2:37:13.400 --> 2:37:17.400]  to change the very DNA of the human species
[2:37:17.400 --> 2:37:20.400]  to mutate us into a form that they can control
[2:37:20.400 --> 2:37:22.400]  like a pawn on the Shetford.
[2:37:22.400 --> 2:37:24.400]  The bottom line is they want to play God.
[2:37:24.400 --> 2:37:26.400]  They are playing God and
[2:37:26.400 --> 2:37:29.400]  the news is only going to tide around our necks
[2:37:29.400 --> 2:37:30.400]  from here on out.
[2:37:30.400 --> 2:37:32.400]  So many other people want to be positive.
[2:37:32.400 --> 2:37:34.400]  They want to put out fake news
[2:37:34.400 --> 2:37:36.400]  and want to only cover limited amounts
[2:37:36.400 --> 2:37:38.400]  of what's happening with New World Order.
[2:37:38.400 --> 2:37:40.400]  But at the end of the day it's all about the population.
[2:37:40.400 --> 2:37:41.400]  It's all about world government.
[2:37:41.400 --> 2:37:43.400]  It's all about the end of the human system
[2:37:43.400 --> 2:37:44.400]  as we know it.
[2:37:44.400 --> 2:37:46.400]  Now it's ashes and nightmare being built.
[2:37:46.400 --> 2:37:58.400]  It's the only thing that can turn around and stop it.
[2:37:58.400 --> 2:38:02.400]  All right.
[2:38:02.400 --> 2:38:04.400]  Final segment with Steve Quill.
[2:38:04.400 --> 2:38:06.400]  I'll host a couple segments
[2:38:06.400 --> 2:38:08.400]  ahead of John Rapport to finish the news
[2:38:08.400 --> 2:38:10.400]  and breaking information.
[2:38:10.400 --> 2:38:12.400]  And again, this is literally my idea.
[2:38:12.400 --> 2:38:14.400]  Steve Quill's been a guest on my show
[2:38:14.400 --> 2:38:16.400]  for 25 years,
[2:38:16.400 --> 2:38:18.400]  but on there 27.
[2:38:18.400 --> 2:38:20.400]  He's been coming on for 25 years.
[2:38:20.400 --> 2:38:22.400]  We sell some of his books at enforce.com.
[2:38:22.400 --> 2:38:24.400]  He never even comes on to even plug stuff.
[2:38:24.400 --> 2:38:26.400]  I was just like, hey, what's the hottest thing
[2:38:26.400 --> 2:38:27.400]  in preparedness?
[2:38:27.400 --> 2:38:29.400]  He said, I've been telling you 10 years at Sappho's
[2:38:29.400 --> 2:38:31.400]  and now they've come down way in price.
[2:38:31.400 --> 2:38:33.400]  We got this great, and I was like, okay, let me pay you.
[2:38:33.400 --> 2:38:35.400]  He goes, no, don't go through me.
[2:38:35.400 --> 2:38:36.400]  Just get people phones.
[2:38:36.400 --> 2:38:37.400]  They're going to need these.
[2:38:37.400 --> 2:38:38.400]  So then I go look it up.
[2:38:38.400 --> 2:38:40.400]  And again, it's right up there is the best deals.
[2:38:40.400 --> 2:38:41.400]  It's all apples and oranges.
[2:38:41.400 --> 2:38:45.400]  These are $500, $600, $700 to get the phone.
[2:38:45.400 --> 2:38:47.400]  And then it's a certain amount per minute.
[2:38:47.400 --> 2:38:50.400]  This is no pay for the phone, free phone.
[2:38:50.400 --> 2:38:52.400]  And then you get the 150 minutes or whatever a month.
[2:38:52.400 --> 2:38:53.400]  They can roll forward.
[2:38:53.400 --> 2:38:55.400]  This is amongst the best deals.
[2:38:55.400 --> 2:38:57.400]  And you certainly aren't going to get it from an established
[2:38:57.400 --> 2:38:59.400]  company or folks that are funding this operation.
[2:38:59.400 --> 2:39:01.400]  And some folks are some of the crews like, well,
[2:39:01.400 --> 2:39:02.400]  you're not making much money off that.
[2:39:02.400 --> 2:39:03.400]  Well, there's not a lot of money in it
[2:39:03.400 --> 2:39:05.400]  because they've already cut the price down so much.
[2:39:05.400 --> 2:39:06.400]  But that funds our operation.
[2:39:06.400 --> 2:39:07.400]  So I want to thank you.
[2:39:07.400 --> 2:39:09.400]  So here's the pitch on it.
[2:39:09.400 --> 2:39:12.400]  Infowarsphone.com, you go there and get the best deal.
[2:39:12.400 --> 2:39:15.400]  When the cell towers go down and the power failure,
[2:39:15.400 --> 2:39:16.400]  satellite phones will still work.
[2:39:16.400 --> 2:39:19.400]  Cell phones are always tracking and logging everywhere you go.
[2:39:19.400 --> 2:39:22.400]  And everything you say, satellite phones do not have this issue.
[2:39:22.400 --> 2:39:25.400]  Satellite phones work at any extreme remote location.
[2:39:25.400 --> 2:39:27.400]  If you see the sky, your phone will work.
[2:39:27.400 --> 2:39:29.400]  And that little antenna that goes out your door,
[2:39:29.400 --> 2:39:31.400]  put on your house, it'll work inside your house too.
[2:39:31.400 --> 2:39:33.400]  The Alex Jones Special is a free satellite phone
[2:39:33.400 --> 2:39:36.400]  and $99.95 per month for 150 minutes per month.
[2:39:36.400 --> 2:39:38.400]  That's a great deal.
[2:39:38.400 --> 2:39:41.400]  No charge for receiving calls from the cell phones or landlines
[2:39:41.400 --> 2:39:43.400]  in your satellite phone.
[2:39:43.400 --> 2:39:45.400]  Car antennas and home antennas are available.
[2:39:45.400 --> 2:39:47.400]  Satellite phones can be used indoors while traveling
[2:39:47.400 --> 2:39:49.400]  or in your vehicle.
[2:39:49.400 --> 2:39:51.400]  Stay in touch with loved ones during an actual
[2:39:51.400 --> 2:39:52.400]  and international emergency.
[2:39:52.400 --> 2:39:54.400]  Now is the time for satellite phones.
[2:39:54.400 --> 2:39:57.400]  That is infowarsphone.com.
[2:39:57.400 --> 2:40:00.400]  And again, I did the math for a week with my folks.
[2:40:00.400 --> 2:40:02.400]  The first thing I do in a business is,
[2:40:02.400 --> 2:40:03.400]  he's a great guy.
[2:40:03.400 --> 2:40:04.400]  Maybe I'll go out and do this myself.
[2:40:04.400 --> 2:40:05.400]  And I called him and said, go ahead if you want.
[2:40:05.400 --> 2:40:06.400]  I'm just recommending it.
[2:40:06.400 --> 2:40:08.400]  We're like, okay, this is about as good a deal
[2:40:08.400 --> 2:40:09.400]  as we're going to get.
[2:40:09.400 --> 2:40:10.400]  This is established folks.
[2:40:10.400 --> 2:40:11.400]  They have good customer service.
[2:40:11.400 --> 2:40:12.400]  We're going to use them.
[2:40:12.400 --> 2:40:13.400]  It's a great job, Steve.
[2:40:13.400 --> 2:40:14.400]  Well, recommending this to me.
[2:40:14.400 --> 2:40:16.400]  Hopefully it'll help fund our operation
[2:40:16.400 --> 2:40:17.400]  and get folks prepared.
[2:40:17.400 --> 2:40:20.400]  So again, thank you for helping infowars for 25 years,
[2:40:20.400 --> 2:40:21.400]  my friend.
[2:40:21.400 --> 2:40:22.400]  Well, you're welcome, Alex.
[2:40:22.400 --> 2:40:25.400]  And one thing too, the standard cell phone,
[2:40:25.400 --> 2:40:27.400]  or I call them health phones.
[2:40:27.400 --> 2:40:28.400]  I'm dumping mine.
[2:40:28.400 --> 2:40:30.400]  I'm going to only be available to select people
[2:40:30.400 --> 2:40:32.400]  by my satellite phone.
[2:40:32.400 --> 2:40:34.400]  But the deal is, is that standby,
[2:40:34.400 --> 2:40:37.400]  they have 160 hours of battery life.
[2:40:37.400 --> 2:40:39.400]  And again, I mean, I heard for so many people,
[2:40:39.400 --> 2:40:42.400]  by the way, Tina's satellite phone, the owner of it,
[2:40:42.400 --> 2:40:44.400]  she tells the stories about people.
[2:40:44.400 --> 2:40:46.400]  People will pay thousands of dollars
[2:40:46.400 --> 2:40:49.400]  if they can get them to them overnight.
[2:40:49.400 --> 2:40:51.400]  Because they, you know, I mean, there's one.
[2:40:51.400 --> 2:40:54.400]  But you know the military and only uses those.
[2:40:54.400 --> 2:40:55.400]  Yep.
[2:40:55.400 --> 2:40:56.400]  Yep.
[2:40:56.400 --> 2:40:58.400]  Because again, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:40:58.400 --> 2:41:00.400]  if you have a cell phone, every place you,
[2:41:00.400 --> 2:41:02.400]  every step, everything you say,
[2:41:02.400 --> 2:41:06.400]  the key is this, they're making war on the independent news,
[2:41:06.400 --> 2:41:08.400]  because that's what scares them.
[2:41:08.400 --> 2:41:11.400]  It scares them that you're hearing the truth.
[2:41:11.400 --> 2:41:14.400]  And Alex, I would tell people right now,
[2:41:14.400 --> 2:41:16.400]  please support Alex and buy food.
[2:41:16.400 --> 2:41:18.400]  I don't sell food, okay?
[2:41:18.400 --> 2:41:21.400]  Please, please support him and buy health food supplements.
[2:41:21.400 --> 2:41:23.400]  I don't sell those.
[2:41:23.400 --> 2:41:25.400]  The day will come, you mark my words,
[2:41:25.400 --> 2:41:27.400]  when every single health food supplement
[2:41:27.400 --> 2:41:31.400]  will be out the market, except through the pharmaceutical companies.
[2:41:31.400 --> 2:41:33.400]  That's why they're working overtime.
[2:41:33.400 --> 2:41:34.400]  So support info works.
[2:41:34.400 --> 2:41:35.400]  I agree with you.
[2:41:35.400 --> 2:41:37.400]  So let's pull back here.
[2:41:37.400 --> 2:41:38.400]  Yep.
[2:41:38.400 --> 2:41:40.400]  What do you make of the world right now?
[2:41:40.400 --> 2:41:41.400]  What's happening?
[2:41:41.400 --> 2:41:42.400]  Where they're going?
[2:41:42.400 --> 2:41:43.400]  They're backing off a few lockdowns.
[2:41:43.400 --> 2:41:45.400]  I think you just clamp them right back down.
[2:41:45.400 --> 2:41:46.400]  Well, they are.
[2:41:46.400 --> 2:41:49.400]  The key is they need something more frightening.
[2:41:49.400 --> 2:41:51.400]  And come on, double mask.
[2:41:51.400 --> 2:41:54.400]  Why don't they just tell you to go buy a trash bag,
[2:41:54.400 --> 2:41:56.400]  cut two eyes out for the eye holes,
[2:41:56.400 --> 2:41:58.400]  and wear it over your, you know what?
[2:41:58.400 --> 2:42:01.400]  I mean, I would say this, no, I can't say that.
[2:42:01.400 --> 2:42:04.400]  The eye holes, I mean, come on.
[2:42:04.400 --> 2:42:06.400]  You know, it's ridiculous.
[2:42:06.400 --> 2:42:08.400]  Why don't they just say, hold your breath and die.
[2:42:08.400 --> 2:42:11.400]  You never have to worry about the vaccine again.
[2:42:11.400 --> 2:42:13.400]  Because ladies and gentlemen, our brain,
[2:42:13.400 --> 2:42:18.400]  our entire God-created bodies need oxygen.
[2:42:18.400 --> 2:42:19.400]  We need to have oxygen.
[2:42:19.400 --> 2:42:20.400]  Let me bring this up.
[2:42:20.400 --> 2:42:21.400]  I know you've been all over the world.
[2:42:21.400 --> 2:42:24.400]  You should come back just about your books and films you've made.
[2:42:24.400 --> 2:42:26.400]  Definitely, this is off-world stuff,
[2:42:26.400 --> 2:42:28.400]  and God is above that, and God is supreme.
[2:42:28.400 --> 2:42:30.400]  But we're being allowed to be attacked by these entities.
[2:42:30.400 --> 2:42:32.400]  From your research, where do they come from?
[2:42:32.400 --> 2:42:33.400]  Who are they?
[2:42:33.400 --> 2:42:34.400]  What dimension?
[2:42:34.400 --> 2:42:35.400]  I mean, because they want to kill us, obviously.
[2:42:35.400 --> 2:42:37.400]  And then they've got humans working with them.
[2:42:37.400 --> 2:42:38.400]  Who are they?
[2:42:38.400 --> 2:42:41.400]  Well, first of all, the Bible is very clear.
[2:42:41.400 --> 2:42:43.400]  And again, you know, I'm one of the guys
[2:42:43.400 --> 2:42:44.400]  that does a lot of investigating.
[2:42:44.400 --> 2:42:46.400]  Bottom line is, I don't even talk about that.
[2:42:46.400 --> 2:42:48.400]  But you've been explaining, you've been all over the world.
[2:42:48.400 --> 2:42:51.400]  You make big hit TV shows, you know,
[2:42:51.400 --> 2:42:52.400]  like a lot of the Prometheus movies
[2:42:52.400 --> 2:42:53.400]  based on stuff you've written.
[2:42:53.400 --> 2:42:55.400]  Explain that to us.
[2:42:55.400 --> 2:42:57.400]  Well, first of all, it's fun when you get calls
[2:42:57.400 --> 2:42:58.400]  from people in Hollywood saying,
[2:42:58.400 --> 2:43:01.400]  hey, we just heard you on Alex Jones' show,
[2:43:01.400 --> 2:43:02.400]  Or Coast to Coast.
[2:43:02.400 --> 2:43:03.400]  And guess what?
[2:43:03.400 --> 2:43:05.400]  You know, this character or that character,
[2:43:05.400 --> 2:43:08.400]  you know, is based on the stuff we're hearing from you.
[2:43:08.400 --> 2:43:12.400]  And they said, Steve, you're a cheap script writer.
[2:43:12.400 --> 2:43:14.400]  And I'm going to clarify something.
[2:43:14.400 --> 2:43:16.400]  I have film crews that go all over the world.
[2:43:16.400 --> 2:43:20.400]  I pretty much stay put because being not so much favored,
[2:43:20.400 --> 2:43:22.400]  last place I went was Peru.
[2:43:22.400 --> 2:43:25.400]  And the thing is, is that the globalists
[2:43:25.400 --> 2:43:28.400]  are fallen angel puppets, okay?
[2:43:28.400 --> 2:43:30.400]  I want to share something with fallen angels.
[2:43:30.400 --> 2:43:32.400]  They're throughout history.
[2:43:32.400 --> 2:43:36.400]  Every myth, every legend, every oral tradition
[2:43:36.400 --> 2:43:38.400]  talks about the gods, a little G,
[2:43:38.400 --> 2:43:41.400]  coming from the heavens to make with earthwomen.
[2:43:41.400 --> 2:43:45.400]  The entire Greek mythological scene is set in that.
[2:43:45.400 --> 2:43:47.400]  You have the Titans, you have the Olympians.
[2:43:47.400 --> 2:43:49.400]  But we go back, Alex, more and more,
[2:43:49.400 --> 2:43:53.400]  every single ancient and pre,
[2:43:53.400 --> 2:43:56.400]  what I would call pre-Adamic images
[2:43:56.400 --> 2:43:59.400]  are always showing giants with angel wings
[2:43:59.400 --> 2:44:01.400]  and an earthly standing guy.
[2:44:01.400 --> 2:44:02.400]  So here's the deal.
[2:44:02.400 --> 2:44:05.400]  The demons, this is what most people don't understand.
[2:44:05.400 --> 2:44:09.400]  There has been a race of hybrids.
[2:44:09.400 --> 2:44:11.400]  And by the way, that race of hybrids is now
[2:44:11.400 --> 2:44:13.400]  what they're trying to do to the human race
[2:44:13.400 --> 2:44:16.400]  to make it no longer subject to redemption.
[2:44:16.400 --> 2:44:20.400]  So what I'm saying is this, fallen angels have sex,
[2:44:20.400 --> 2:44:23.400]  yes, sex with earthwomen, producing hybrids
[2:44:23.400 --> 2:44:25.400]  when those hybrids died or were killed
[2:44:25.400 --> 2:44:27.400]  by Goliath in the Bible.
[2:44:27.400 --> 2:44:29.400]  The bottom line is that spirit,
[2:44:29.400 --> 2:44:31.400]  that was not a human spirit, it was a hybrid spirit
[2:44:31.400 --> 2:44:35.400]  combined with supernatural, angelic DNA
[2:44:35.400 --> 2:44:36.400]  and human DNA.
[2:44:36.400 --> 2:44:39.400]  Those were the mighty men of history.
[2:44:39.400 --> 2:44:41.400]  And just like when a horse makes with a donkey,
[2:44:41.400 --> 2:44:44.400]  it makes some mule, but it can't have babies.
[2:44:44.400 --> 2:44:46.400]  And all the things said this, there's these super men,
[2:44:46.400 --> 2:44:49.400]  super smart, super big, but they couldn't have children.
[2:44:49.400 --> 2:44:51.400]  That all got wiped out.
[2:44:51.400 --> 2:44:53.400]  And now the globalists are trying to, and God is very racist,
[2:44:53.400 --> 2:44:54.400]  not against black or white.
[2:44:54.400 --> 2:44:56.400]  God only likes the genetics God created.
[2:44:56.400 --> 2:44:58.400]  And that's why when we merge with this
[2:44:58.400 --> 2:45:01.400]  or our own elites start building human animal hybrids,
[2:45:01.400 --> 2:45:03.400]  that pissed us God off, right?
[2:45:03.400 --> 2:45:06.400]  Well, not only, I would say this, it angers him
[2:45:06.400 --> 2:45:09.400]  because of the destruction of the human genome.
[2:45:09.400 --> 2:45:10.400]  Something, see what happens.
[2:45:10.400 --> 2:45:12.400]  Well, the only time God destroyed all the life was over this, right?
[2:45:12.400 --> 2:45:14.400]  Like God does not like this.
[2:45:14.400 --> 2:45:17.400]  Prior to, and some people don't believe in the flood and know it.
[2:45:17.400 --> 2:45:20.400]  Listen, I won't argue that it's all over the great floods,
[2:45:20.400 --> 2:45:23.400]  the Native Americans, people all over the world
[2:45:23.400 --> 2:45:24.400]  have that tradition.
[2:45:24.400 --> 2:45:27.400]  But here's the deal, even the Atlantis mysteries,
[2:45:27.400 --> 2:45:30.400]  the mysteries of the hyperbore of the mystic civilizations,
[2:45:30.400 --> 2:45:34.400]  when they started screwing around with DNA,
[2:45:34.400 --> 2:45:36.400]  that's when they got wiped out.
[2:45:36.400 --> 2:45:40.400]  So the third helix, and look, we just heard the word Xenobots.
[2:45:40.400 --> 2:45:43.400]  You guys at InfoWars sell the book Xenogenesis,
[2:45:43.400 --> 2:45:46.400]  and that was written almost 10 years ago,
[2:45:46.400 --> 2:45:51.400]  means a human DNA strand with something supernaturally evil.
[2:45:51.400 --> 2:45:53.400]  Look, Satan is believed in the power of Satan.
[2:45:53.400 --> 2:45:56.400]  Luciferians worship Lord Lucifer,
[2:45:56.400 --> 2:45:59.400]  but the Christians don't get it that Jesus said,
[2:45:59.400 --> 2:46:01.400]  we've got power, we've got faith,
[2:46:01.400 --> 2:46:03.400]  we've got the gifts of the Holy Spirit,
[2:46:03.400 --> 2:46:04.400]  and why are we...
[2:46:04.400 --> 2:46:05.400]  Well, explain that.
[2:46:05.400 --> 2:46:08.400]  Our DNA literally resonates with God as a receiver.
[2:46:08.400 --> 2:46:10.400]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:46:10.400 --> 2:46:13.400]  Can you imagine being creating the image and likeness of God?
[2:46:13.400 --> 2:46:17.400]  That doesn't really endear us to Satan, the devil.
[2:46:17.400 --> 2:46:19.400]  Because we're literally so much more powerful,
[2:46:19.400 --> 2:46:21.400]  we just don't know it.
[2:46:21.400 --> 2:46:23.400]  Well, yeah, but see, here's the deal.
[2:46:23.400 --> 2:46:25.400]  God says we're more powerful.
[2:46:25.400 --> 2:46:28.400]  He said, behold, I give you powers to spread on serpents
[2:46:28.400 --> 2:46:30.400]  and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy,
[2:46:30.400 --> 2:46:32.400]  and nothing shall by any means hurt you.
[2:46:32.400 --> 2:46:35.400]  99.9% of churches don't teach that.
[2:46:35.400 --> 2:46:39.400]  And the pulpits have turned into political action committees.
[2:46:39.400 --> 2:46:44.400]  Just like 500 pastors claiming abortion is a God's blessing.
[2:46:44.400 --> 2:46:46.400]  And if anybody is against abortion,
[2:46:46.400 --> 2:46:49.400]  you're now a Christian nationalist.
[2:46:49.400 --> 2:46:52.400]  Why do the churches reject God's power?
[2:46:52.400 --> 2:46:54.400]  It's so pathetic.
[2:46:54.400 --> 2:46:57.400]  Well, because they want friendship with the world.
[2:46:57.400 --> 2:46:59.400]  They want to be seeker-friendly.
[2:46:59.400 --> 2:47:00.400]  And the Bible is very clear, Alex.
[2:47:00.400 --> 2:47:03.400]  It says friendship with the world is enmity with God.
[2:47:03.400 --> 2:47:06.400]  The book of Genesis chapter 3 verse 15,
[2:47:06.400 --> 2:47:09.400]  God puts us at war with the devil.
[2:47:09.400 --> 2:47:11.400]  And that's the thing.
[2:47:11.400 --> 2:47:14.400]  All spiritual warfare is manifesting in the present now.
[2:47:14.400 --> 2:47:16.400]  The Bible talks about the book of Revelation
[2:47:16.400 --> 2:47:19.400]  when Satan and his angels are thrown out.
[2:47:19.400 --> 2:47:23.400]  And by the way, people are seeing all sorts of demonic manifestations now.
[2:47:23.400 --> 2:47:25.400]  My emails fill up with it.
[2:47:25.400 --> 2:47:27.400]  People are seeing more UFOs.
[2:47:27.400 --> 2:47:29.400]  People are seeing more aliens.
[2:47:29.400 --> 2:47:30.400]  People are absolutely...
[2:47:30.400 --> 2:47:31.400]  But it's also all over the news.
[2:47:31.400 --> 2:47:35.400]  It's like the membrane of the dimensions is dissolving.
[2:47:35.400 --> 2:47:37.400]  Right. Well, and I'd say this.
[2:47:37.400 --> 2:47:41.400]  The dimensions, the doorways that God placed within,
[2:47:41.400 --> 2:47:43.400]  if you will, almost gateways,
[2:47:43.400 --> 2:47:46.400]  that he said you cannot enter here to Satan's fallen angels.
[2:47:46.400 --> 2:47:49.400]  Those are all being torn down by mankind,
[2:47:49.400 --> 2:47:51.400]  believing that with all the money they get
[2:47:51.400 --> 2:47:53.400]  and all the power they get,
[2:47:53.400 --> 2:47:56.400]  they're going to be, excuse me, on the winning team with Satan.
[2:47:56.400 --> 2:47:59.400]  And so they're going to destroy everything.
[2:47:59.400 --> 2:48:00.400]  It's just like this.
[2:48:00.400 --> 2:48:02.400]  Satan can't get at God,
[2:48:02.400 --> 2:48:04.400]  but he gets at God's image and likeness.
[2:48:04.400 --> 2:48:08.400]  It's just like a woman carrying up a picture of her ex-boyfriend
[2:48:08.400 --> 2:48:10.400]  or whatever vice versa.
[2:48:10.400 --> 2:48:11.400]  So...
[2:48:11.400 --> 2:48:12.400]  Well, I'll tell you there, do a few more minutes
[2:48:12.400 --> 2:48:15.400]  while the sequel is kicking a lot of globalist rear-end right now.
[2:48:15.400 --> 2:48:17.400]  And then John Rabaport, numberfakenews.com,
[2:48:17.400 --> 2:48:19.400]  is going to take over in 15 minutes.
[2:48:19.400 --> 2:48:21.400]  Can you do 50 more minutes, Steve?
[2:48:21.400 --> 2:48:22.400]  Yeah, I've got to see.
[2:48:22.400 --> 2:48:24.400]  All right. All right. We'll be right back.
[2:48:24.400 --> 2:48:26.400]  Hour number four straight ahead.
[2:48:26.400 --> 2:48:27.400]  And folks, no one denies this now.
[2:48:27.400 --> 2:48:29.400]  This is an alien take.
[2:48:29.400 --> 2:48:30.400]  It's what it is.
[2:48:30.400 --> 2:48:32.400]  The globalists want to kill humanity.
[2:48:32.400 --> 2:48:34.400]  They say a new species is coming.
[2:48:36.400 --> 2:48:39.400]  As you know, we're always upping our game at M4 Wars,
[2:48:39.400 --> 2:48:42.400]  and we brought you a new supplement, a new product that we know you're going to love,
[2:48:42.400 --> 2:48:44.400]  especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[2:48:44.400 --> 2:48:45.400]  It is down and out.
[2:48:45.400 --> 2:48:47.400]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[2:48:47.400 --> 2:48:50.400]  We mean down your bed sleeping hard throughout the night.
[2:48:50.400 --> 2:48:53.400]  It's got four milligrams of high-quality melatonin.
[2:48:53.400 --> 2:48:55.400]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.
[2:48:55.400 --> 2:48:59.400]  It's got 50 milligrams of Valerian root extract concentrate.
[2:48:59.400 --> 2:49:01.400]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm
[2:49:01.400 --> 2:49:04.400]  and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[2:49:04.400 --> 2:49:07.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[2:49:07.400 --> 2:49:10.400]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[2:49:10.400 --> 2:49:12.400]  It's liquid, so it goes right into your body fast.
[2:49:12.400 --> 2:49:14.400]  If you take it sublingually under the tongue,
[2:49:14.400 --> 2:49:16.400]  oh, how about blasting off to sleep?
[2:49:16.400 --> 2:49:17.400]  It's incredible.
[2:49:17.400 --> 2:49:19.400]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[2:49:19.400 --> 2:49:21.400]  It's so popular we can't keep it in stock.

[2:50:00.400 --> 2:50:02.400]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[2:50:02.400 --> 2:50:06.400]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[2:50:06.400 --> 2:50:08.400]  They are playing God.
[2:50:08.400 --> 2:50:12.400]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities
[2:50:12.400 --> 2:50:15.400]  that are giving them advanced technology
[2:50:15.400 --> 2:50:17.400]  to carry out this transformation.
[2:50:17.400 --> 2:50:19.400]  I know this sounds insane,
[2:50:19.400 --> 2:50:21.400]  but if you read the writings of the globalist,
[2:50:21.400 --> 2:50:23.400]  it's all on record.
[2:50:23.400 --> 2:50:25.400]  You have been warned.
[2:50:25.400 --> 2:50:30.400]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[2:50:30.400 --> 2:50:33.400]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it.
[2:50:33.400 --> 2:50:36.400]  This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[2:50:39.400 --> 2:50:43.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:43.400 --> 2:50:55.400]  Before you slip into unconsciousness,
[2:50:55.400 --> 2:51:00.400]  I'd like to have another care.
[2:51:00.400 --> 2:51:04.400]  All right, Steve Quayle is a very interesting individual.
[2:51:04.400 --> 2:51:07.400]  And he's here with us today.
[2:51:07.400 --> 2:51:09.400]  And we've got a five-minute segment here,
[2:51:09.400 --> 2:51:11.400]  a ten-minute segment where he'll be gone,
[2:51:11.400 --> 2:51:13.400]  and we'll be back with another.
[2:51:13.400 --> 2:51:15.400]  Here's the thing.
[2:51:15.400 --> 2:51:17.400]  I used to hear you 25 years ago and think,
[2:51:17.400 --> 2:51:19.400]  okay, he's a smart guy, but this is too far.
[2:51:19.400 --> 2:51:21.400]  They want to merge with machines, animals.
[2:51:21.400 --> 2:51:23.400]  They want to sterilize everybody, kill everybody.
[2:51:23.400 --> 2:51:25.400]  And then now they're on the news saying it.
[2:51:25.400 --> 2:51:27.400]  And Klaus Schwab is saying it's good that everything's locked down
[2:51:27.400 --> 2:51:29.400]  because humans are bad.
[2:51:29.400 --> 2:51:31.400]  I mean, why do they...
[2:51:31.400 --> 2:51:33.400]  I asked you this to start, but why do they need...
[2:51:33.400 --> 2:51:35.400]  I think this is the key.
[2:51:35.400 --> 2:51:39.400]  Why do they need to tell us what they're doing?
[2:51:39.400 --> 2:51:41.400]  And that's God's law, isn't it?
[2:51:41.400 --> 2:51:43.400]  But what's crazy is though, they're telling us.
[2:51:43.400 --> 2:51:45.400]  Is it just rubbing it in or is it something else?
[2:51:45.400 --> 2:51:47.400]  Well, it's rubbing it in.
[2:51:47.400 --> 2:51:50.400]  The bottom line is the Bible says God always warns us people
[2:51:50.400 --> 2:51:52.400]  of what's coming.
[2:51:52.400 --> 2:51:54.400]  The problem is, Alex, they don't pay attention.
[2:51:54.400 --> 2:51:56.400]  And just like the alien phenomenon, you know,
[2:51:56.400 --> 2:51:59.400]  I said in January, and we talked about it just briefly on your show,
[2:51:59.400 --> 2:52:01.400]  I said, watch in the next six months.
[2:52:01.400 --> 2:52:03.400]  You said it's going to explode.
[2:52:03.400 --> 2:52:05.400]  It's all over the news.
[2:52:05.400 --> 2:52:07.400]  Yeah, it's all over the news.
[2:52:07.400 --> 2:52:10.400]  We're talking about the alien civilization in Latin America right now.
[2:52:10.400 --> 2:52:14.400]  And I literally have some of the smartest guys
[2:52:14.400 --> 2:52:17.400]  looking through alien artifacts
[2:52:17.400 --> 2:52:20.400]  that predate the Aztec Empire
[2:52:20.400 --> 2:52:23.400]  that show the Aztecs and aliens
[2:52:23.400 --> 2:52:25.400]  intermingling.
[2:52:25.400 --> 2:52:27.400]  Yeah, what's going on in Latin America?
[2:52:27.400 --> 2:52:29.400]  It's like they're falling out of the sky down there.
[2:52:29.400 --> 2:52:31.400]  Well, yeah, because here's the deal.
[2:52:31.400 --> 2:52:33.400]  There are so many volcanoes that are active.
[2:52:33.400 --> 2:52:36.400]  What people need to understand, all of the stuff we have,
[2:52:36.400 --> 2:52:38.400]  our stuff and their stuff.
[2:52:38.400 --> 2:52:40.400]  That's even what Dr. Warren von Bronson, who, by the way,
[2:52:40.400 --> 2:52:42.400]  was a Nazi that was brought to the United States
[2:52:42.400 --> 2:52:44.400]  under Operation Paperclip.
[2:52:44.400 --> 2:52:46.400]  But he also became the head of NASA.
[2:52:46.400 --> 2:52:48.400]  Never a straight answer.
[2:52:48.400 --> 2:52:50.400]  But the point being, Alex, is so much activity
[2:52:50.400 --> 2:52:52.400]  in South America, Latin America,
[2:52:52.400 --> 2:52:54.400]  where there's massive amounts of volcanoes,
[2:52:54.400 --> 2:52:56.400]  there's a lot of activity.
[2:52:56.400 --> 2:52:58.400]  For instance, Popo, out of Mexico City.
[2:52:58.400 --> 2:53:00.400]  People routinely see,
[2:53:00.400 --> 2:53:02.400]  they routinely see this stuff
[2:53:02.400 --> 2:53:04.400]  on the live feeds
[2:53:04.400 --> 2:53:06.400]  of unidentified flying,
[2:53:06.400 --> 2:53:08.400]  or unidentified flying objects.
[2:53:08.400 --> 2:53:10.400]  I call them IFOs,
[2:53:10.400 --> 2:53:12.400]  identified flying objects.
[2:53:12.400 --> 2:53:14.400]  Well, you've got all the carvings in the Spanish Museums
[2:53:14.400 --> 2:53:16.400]  confirmed of space men flying saucers.
[2:53:16.400 --> 2:53:18.400]  Looks like jumbo jets with like four engines on them.
[2:53:18.400 --> 2:53:20.400]  I mean, this is insane.
[2:53:20.400 --> 2:53:22.400]  Well, it's not only insane,
[2:53:22.400 --> 2:53:24.400]  but wait until you see, at some point,
[2:53:24.400 --> 2:53:26.400]  you know, if you'd like,
[2:53:26.400 --> 2:53:28.400]  my expedition should be back in 30 days.
[2:53:28.400 --> 2:53:30.400]  I'm just telling you,
[2:53:30.400 --> 2:53:32.400]  it's mind-blowing, Alex.
[2:53:32.400 --> 2:53:34.400]  It's mind-blowing to find artifacts.
[2:53:34.400 --> 2:53:36.400]  Not a few that could have been chiseled out
[2:53:36.400 --> 2:53:38.400]  in some guy's backyard,
[2:53:38.400 --> 2:53:40.400]  but showing the Aztec alien interaction,
[2:53:40.400 --> 2:53:42.400]  actual flying saucers.
[2:53:42.400 --> 2:53:44.400]  Interestingly enough,
[2:53:44.400 --> 2:53:46.400]  the Rosetta Stone, and I even took a project,
[2:53:46.400 --> 2:53:48.400]  this is really critical,
[2:53:48.400 --> 2:53:50.400]  to basically take all the glyphs,
[2:53:50.400 --> 2:53:52.400]  all of the different stone symbols,
[2:53:52.400 --> 2:53:54.400]  all of the glyphs off of crashed
[2:53:54.400 --> 2:53:56.400]  alien control panels,
[2:53:56.400 --> 2:53:58.400]  and I have some really smart guys
[2:53:58.400 --> 2:54:00.400]  using supercomputers
[2:54:00.400 --> 2:54:02.400]  out of the United States, for obvious reasons,
[2:54:02.400 --> 2:54:04.400]  trying, and they have succeeded
[2:54:04.400 --> 2:54:06.400]  in deciphering.
[2:54:06.400 --> 2:54:08.400]  You know what the glyphs indicate?
[2:54:08.400 --> 2:54:10.400]  They're kind of the bragging rights
[2:54:10.400 --> 2:54:12.400]  of the fallen angels.
[2:54:12.400 --> 2:54:14.400]  It's where they came from,
[2:54:14.400 --> 2:54:16.400]  coming from the stars, or the dimensions.
[2:54:16.400 --> 2:54:18.400]  Let me make a statement.
[2:54:18.400 --> 2:54:20.400]  A portal is between dimensions,
[2:54:20.400 --> 2:54:22.400]  a star gate is between
[2:54:22.400 --> 2:54:24.400]  two places in time and space.
[2:54:24.400 --> 2:54:26.400]  So what I'm doing
[2:54:26.400 --> 2:54:28.400]  is trying to flood,
[2:54:28.400 --> 2:54:30.400]  and I'm not going to submit
[2:54:30.400 --> 2:54:32.400]  to the narrative that the deception
[2:54:32.400 --> 2:54:34.400]  is going to come. By the way, the Catholic Church
[2:54:34.400 --> 2:54:36.400]  is preparing half of them
[2:54:36.400 --> 2:54:38.400]  to basically say that
[2:54:38.400 --> 2:54:40.400]  aliens are creators.
[2:54:40.400 --> 2:54:42.400]  So, and not all Catholics
[2:54:42.400 --> 2:54:44.400]  know that, but the most
[2:54:44.400 --> 2:54:46.400]  famous guy, Guy Comsalogno,
[2:54:46.400 --> 2:54:48.400]  one of the most brilliant astronomers
[2:54:48.400 --> 2:54:50.400]  literally wrote about
[2:54:50.400 --> 2:54:52.400]  since God created the universe,
[2:54:52.400 --> 2:54:54.400]  could not aliens be sentient beings,
[2:54:54.400 --> 2:54:56.400]  and could not they have had
[2:54:56.400 --> 2:54:58.400]  a role in our evolution
[2:54:58.400 --> 2:55:00.400]  or development? So, the point
[2:55:00.400 --> 2:55:02.400]  is, is that's a big lie. That's what's
[2:55:02.400 --> 2:55:04.400]  coming, and we'll talk about that.
[2:55:04.400 --> 2:55:06.400]  And I'll give you images,
[2:55:06.400 --> 2:55:08.400]  so you can put them on your screen,
[2:55:08.400 --> 2:55:10.400]  that are mind-blowing. It took my breath away,
[2:55:10.400 --> 2:55:12.400]  and I've seen stuff all over the world.
[2:55:12.400 --> 2:55:14.400]  Let me ask you this. It's on Egyptian hieroglyphs,
[2:55:14.400 --> 2:55:16.400]  and mainline
[2:55:16.400 --> 2:55:18.400]  documentaries,
[2:55:18.400 --> 2:55:20.400]  and research from universities
[2:55:20.400 --> 2:55:22.400]  that show perfect Apache helicopters.
[2:55:22.400 --> 2:55:24.400]  I mean,
[2:55:24.400 --> 2:55:26.400]  what is going on here? We're going to come back in
[2:55:26.400 --> 2:55:28.400]  60 seconds with
[2:55:28.400 --> 2:55:30.400]  the one and the only, Steve Quill.
[2:55:30.400 --> 2:55:32.400]  I've done shows with him, PaulWars.com
[2:55:32.400 --> 2:55:34.400]  and NewsWars.com. His site is
[2:55:34.400 --> 2:55:36.400]  SteveQuill.com. We'll talk about
[2:55:36.400 --> 2:55:38.400]  what all this means on the other side.
[2:55:40.400 --> 2:55:42.400]  It's 2 a.m.
[2:55:42.400 --> 2:55:44.400]  Here it is.
[2:55:44.400 --> 2:55:46.400]  I've been thinking a lot lately
[2:55:46.400 --> 2:55:48.400]  about playing devil's advocate
[2:55:48.400 --> 2:55:50.400]  on air.
[2:55:50.400 --> 2:55:52.400]  About looking at the world from the perspective
[2:55:52.400 --> 2:55:54.400]  that the public is so dumbed down
[2:55:54.400 --> 2:55:56.400]  that they don't care that we're stealing their future
[2:55:56.400 --> 2:55:58.400]  from them, that we're poisoning them,
[2:55:58.400 --> 2:56:00.400]  that we're sterilizing them,
[2:56:00.400 --> 2:56:02.400]  that they deserve to be killed.
[2:56:02.400 --> 2:56:04.400]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists.
[2:56:04.400 --> 2:56:06.400]  They play God, and they think because we don't stand up,
[2:56:06.400 --> 2:56:08.400]  they have a right to do this to us.
[2:56:08.400 --> 2:56:10.400]  You know, I've told you
[2:56:10.400 --> 2:56:12.400]  that the globalists have tried to harm me.
[2:56:12.400 --> 2:56:14.400]  They've tried to get me to join them.
[2:56:14.400 --> 2:56:16.400]  But metaphysically, at a spiritual level,
[2:56:16.400 --> 2:56:18.400]  I have the Holy Spirit.
[2:56:18.400 --> 2:56:20.400]  I'm connection with God.
[2:56:20.400 --> 2:56:22.400]  God does not like that, so I cannot join the enemy.
[2:56:22.400 --> 2:56:24.400]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level,
[2:56:24.400 --> 2:56:26.400]  I get very, very mad at people
[2:56:26.400 --> 2:56:28.400]  that go along with the system,
[2:56:28.400 --> 2:56:30.400]  believing you're part of it,
[2:56:30.400 --> 2:56:32.400]  or believing you're getting power out of it.
[2:56:32.400 --> 2:56:34.400]  Whether you're just a steel worker,
[2:56:34.400 --> 2:56:36.400]  or a school teacher, or a Henry Kissinger,
[2:56:36.400 --> 2:56:38.400]  you're not God.
[2:56:38.400 --> 2:56:40.400]  And treating other people
[2:56:40.400 --> 2:56:42.400]  like they're animals, and you're God,
[2:56:42.400 --> 2:56:44.400]  is something that the real God of the Universe
[2:56:44.400 --> 2:56:51.400]  can do, and that's a fact.
[2:56:51.400 --> 2:56:56.400]  From the front lines
[2:56:56.400 --> 2:56:58.400]  of the Information War,
[2:56:58.400 --> 2:57:02.400]  it's Alex Jones.
[2:57:02.400 --> 2:57:05.400]  I am somewhat of a mathematician,
[2:57:05.400 --> 2:57:07.400]  but I'm a political mathematician,
[2:57:07.400 --> 2:57:09.400]  a cultural mathematician,
[2:57:09.400 --> 2:57:12.400]  a study of humanity
[2:57:12.400 --> 2:57:14.400]  and how systems interlay,
[2:57:14.400 --> 2:57:16.400]  and how they operate,
[2:57:16.400 --> 2:57:18.400]  and patterns in previous human activity in different cultures.
[2:57:18.400 --> 2:57:20.400]  And when you have
[2:57:20.400 --> 2:57:22.400]  the head of the Davos group,
[2:57:22.400 --> 2:57:24.400]  and Bill Gates, all of them saying,
[2:57:24.400 --> 2:57:26.400]  we want to post-human world,
[2:57:26.400 --> 2:57:28.400]  we want to get rid of humans,
[2:57:28.400 --> 2:57:30.400]  you have Elon Musk coming out saying,
[2:57:30.400 --> 2:57:32.400]  I met with the billionaires,
[2:57:32.400 --> 2:57:34.400]  and they all want to get rid of humanity,
[2:57:34.400 --> 2:57:36.400]  and beware of AI gods.
[2:57:36.400 --> 2:57:38.400]  And they say, oh, humans are dirty,
[2:57:38.400 --> 2:57:40.400]  carbons bad, we're going to merge the machines
[2:57:40.400 --> 2:57:42.400]  and I know some of these globalists,
[2:57:42.400 --> 2:57:44.400]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[2:57:44.400 --> 2:57:46.400]  None of them believe that there's no God.
[2:57:46.400 --> 2:57:48.400]  They all believe,
[2:57:48.400 --> 2:57:50.400]  in what the New York Times talks about,
[2:57:50.400 --> 2:57:52.400]  this transpermia aliens put us here.
[2:57:52.400 --> 2:57:54.400]  So none of them are atheists.
[2:57:54.400 --> 2:57:56.400]  They teach the average person, oh, there's no God,
[2:57:56.400 --> 2:57:58.400]  oh, we're just on this planet in space,
[2:57:58.400 --> 2:58:00.400]  what's going on.
[2:58:00.400 --> 2:58:02.400]  And then obviously there's God,
[2:58:02.400 --> 2:58:04.400]  and then there's other things that are able to manipulate us
[2:58:04.400 --> 2:58:06.400]  because we have free will.
[2:58:06.400 --> 2:58:08.400]  And so they are getting ready to release all this.
[2:58:08.400 --> 2:58:10.400]  They're all coming out right now.
[2:58:10.400 --> 2:58:12.400]  And we have these people on Earth
[2:58:12.400 --> 2:58:14.400]  telling us humans are bad,
[2:58:14.400 --> 2:58:16.400]  telling us that getting rid of humans is a good thing.
[2:58:16.400 --> 2:58:18.400]  How is that not obvious?
[2:58:18.400 --> 2:58:20.400]  So obviously it's Satan,
[2:58:20.400 --> 2:58:22.400]  but what is Satan from your deep research?
[2:58:22.400 --> 2:58:24.400]  Is it an AI computer?
[2:58:24.400 --> 2:58:26.400]  Is it something God made that went against God?
[2:58:26.400 --> 2:58:28.400]  Obviously God gives free will,
[2:58:28.400 --> 2:58:30.400]  so things can go against God,
[2:58:30.400 --> 2:58:32.400]  we can go against God.
[2:58:32.400 --> 2:58:34.400]  I mean, let's get into real, real hidden stuff here.
[2:58:34.400 --> 2:58:36.400]  Well, first of all,
[2:58:36.400 --> 2:58:38.400]  Lucifer
[2:58:38.400 --> 2:58:40.400]  was one of the anointing cherubs.
[2:58:40.400 --> 2:58:42.400]  A cherub is a higher order
[2:58:42.400 --> 2:58:44.400]  than just your angels,
[2:58:44.400 --> 2:58:46.400]  fallen angels.
[2:58:46.400 --> 2:58:48.400]  So his task
[2:58:48.400 --> 2:58:50.400]  in heaven when God created him
[2:58:50.400 --> 2:58:52.400]  was to basically lead worship
[2:58:52.400 --> 2:58:54.400]  and lead the music
[2:58:54.400 --> 2:58:56.400]  and lead the praise in heaven.
[2:58:56.400 --> 2:58:58.400]  This is what the Bible says.
[2:58:58.400 --> 2:59:00.400]  Not everyone accepts that, but listen to this.
[2:59:00.400 --> 2:59:02.400]  When he got proud,
[2:59:02.400 --> 2:59:04.400]  he got a third of the angels
[2:59:04.400 --> 2:59:06.400]  who agree with him
[2:59:06.400 --> 2:59:08.400]  to basically
[2:59:08.400 --> 2:59:10.400]  try and depose God from his throne.
[2:59:10.400 --> 2:59:12.400]  God kicks him out
[2:59:12.400 --> 2:59:14.400]  of the first heaven,
[2:59:14.400 --> 2:59:16.400]  or the little heaven where not the first heaven,
[2:59:16.400 --> 2:59:18.400]  but the throne room of heaven,
[2:59:18.400 --> 2:59:20.400]  and ever since that time
[2:59:20.400 --> 2:59:22.400]  he's been deceiving mankind,
[2:59:22.400 --> 2:59:24.400]  because when God created Adam and Eve
[2:59:24.400 --> 2:59:26.400]  in his image and likeness,
[2:59:26.400 --> 2:59:28.400]  that's something the devil did not possess.
[2:59:28.400 --> 2:59:30.400]  Lucifer, whatever those...
[2:59:30.400 --> 2:59:32.400]  Bible says that the angels
[2:59:32.400 --> 2:59:34.400]  are ministering spirits,
[2:59:34.400 --> 2:59:36.400]  are ministering spirits,
[2:59:36.400 --> 2:59:38.400]  and that they're absolutely
[2:59:38.400 --> 2:59:40.400]  sentinent beings,
[2:59:40.400 --> 2:59:42.400]  and they literally live
[2:59:42.400 --> 2:59:44.400]  the fallen angels.
[2:59:44.400 --> 2:59:46.400]  Two-thirds didn't fall, one-third did fall,
[2:59:46.400 --> 2:59:48.400]  to destroy mankind.
[2:59:48.400 --> 2:59:50.400]  That's what the book of Revelation is talking about.
[2:59:50.400 --> 2:59:52.400]  Now we see the whole goal is to kill everybody.
[2:59:52.400 --> 2:59:54.400]  I mean, it's all happening.
[2:59:54.400 --> 2:59:56.400]  Absolutely.
[2:59:56.400 --> 2:59:58.400]  And you know, one of my favorite shows,
[2:59:58.400 --> 3:00:00.400]  you probably remember it, the Twilight Zone,
[3:00:00.400 --> 3:00:02.400]  saying to serve man,
[3:00:02.400 --> 3:00:04.400]  you have the alien coming to Earth
[3:00:04.400 --> 3:00:06.400]  promising that they're going to
[3:00:06.400 --> 3:00:08.400]  fix all of mankind's problems.
[3:00:08.400 --> 3:00:10.400]  Then they offer tours to their planet
[3:00:10.400 --> 3:00:12.400]  at the very end scene
[3:00:12.400 --> 3:00:14.400]  of the Twilight Zone.
[3:00:14.400 --> 3:00:16.400]  Basically, the woman's coming to her
[3:00:16.400 --> 3:00:18.400]  scientist friend or lover, whatever,
[3:00:18.400 --> 3:00:20.400]  and saying to serve man,
[3:00:20.400 --> 3:00:22.400]  it's not something to help mankind,
[3:00:22.400 --> 3:00:24.400]  it's to basically eat them.
[3:00:24.400 --> 3:00:26.400]  They're cannibals.
[3:00:26.400 --> 3:00:28.400]  And by the way, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:00:28.400 --> 3:00:30.400]  if I told you there are cannibal restaurants,
[3:00:30.400 --> 3:00:32.400]  you'd say, oh, that isn't real.
[3:00:32.400 --> 3:00:34.400]  Yes, it's real.
[3:00:34.400 --> 3:00:36.400]  If I told you of the satanic sacrifices
[3:00:36.400 --> 3:00:38.400]  of the people that have been there
[3:00:38.400 --> 3:00:40.400]  and had to, you know, describe the gore,
[3:00:40.400 --> 3:00:42.400]  there you go,
[3:00:42.400 --> 3:00:44.400]  most people wouldn't believe that.
[3:00:44.400 --> 3:00:46.400]  They just don't believe it.
[3:00:46.400 --> 3:00:48.400]  Well, let's be clear.
[3:00:48.400 --> 3:00:50.400]  In Italy, it's a big dish in these hidden restaurants
[3:00:50.400 --> 3:00:52.400]  to eat catacomb bones.
[3:00:52.400 --> 3:00:54.400]  They boil it to soup.
[3:00:54.400 --> 3:00:56.400]  That's kind of an entry entree into what's going on.
[3:00:56.400 --> 3:00:58.400]  Absolutely.
[3:00:58.400 --> 3:01:00.400]  And what about, look, I'm not going to take a vaccine
[3:01:00.400 --> 3:01:02.400]  with human babies
[3:01:02.400 --> 3:01:04.400]  creating the image and likeness.
[3:01:04.400 --> 3:01:06.400]  So why are they obsessed?
[3:01:06.400 --> 3:01:08.400]  It's like the golden child, when the demon
[3:01:08.400 --> 3:01:10.400]  under Satan goes, the golden child,
[3:01:10.400 --> 3:01:12.400]  the Christ figure, you will eat it.
[3:01:12.400 --> 3:01:14.400]  It's the blood of dead babies trying to corrupt
[3:01:14.400 --> 3:01:16.400]  him so they can get him. They want to corrupt us.
[3:01:16.400 --> 3:01:18.400]  There's like some genetic rule.
[3:01:18.400 --> 3:01:20.400]  Well, yeah, there's a genetic rule.
[3:01:20.400 --> 3:01:22.400]  You as a human being
[3:01:22.400 --> 3:01:24.400]  created in the image and likeness of the living God.
[3:01:24.400 --> 3:01:26.400]  That's why I'm still opposed
[3:01:26.400 --> 3:01:28.400]  to the genetic manipulation
[3:01:28.400 --> 3:01:30.400]  of these vaccines.
[3:01:30.400 --> 3:01:32.400]  The question I get asked, I can't answer
[3:01:32.400 --> 3:01:34.400]  is at what point
[3:01:34.400 --> 3:01:36.400]  do the mutagenic nature
[3:01:36.400 --> 3:01:38.400]  and they're not vaccines
[3:01:38.400 --> 3:01:40.400]  of the gene insertions
[3:01:40.400 --> 3:01:42.400]  in our human DNA?
[3:01:42.400 --> 3:01:44.400]  At what point do we cease to be human?
[3:01:44.400 --> 3:01:46.400]  They need to think.
[3:01:46.400 --> 3:01:48.400]  Well, that's my next question.
[3:01:48.400 --> 3:01:50.400]  They admit it's a genetically made system
[3:01:50.400 --> 3:01:52.400]  that takes over most of ourselves, makes us really sick.
[3:01:52.400 --> 3:01:54.400]  They're not just pissing on us.
[3:01:54.400 --> 3:01:56.400]  They're raping us genetically
[3:01:56.400 --> 3:01:58.400]  and taking us over.
[3:01:58.400 --> 3:02:00.400]  What is, from your best research,
[3:02:00.400 --> 3:02:02.400]  what is the end game of these mRNA vaccines?
[3:02:02.400 --> 3:02:04.400]  They would risk killing people,
[3:02:04.400 --> 3:02:06.400]  having everybody revolt against them,
[3:02:06.400 --> 3:02:08.400]  but they're just like, you see gates,
[3:02:08.400 --> 3:02:10.400]  he's an ecstasy while this is happening.
[3:02:10.400 --> 3:02:12.400]  He looks so upset for years.
[3:02:12.400 --> 3:02:14.400]  Now he's on TV just like,
[3:02:14.400 --> 3:02:16.400]  I mean, what is going on?
[3:02:16.400 --> 3:02:18.400]  Well, first of all, you nailed it.
[3:02:18.400 --> 3:02:20.400]  They want the end of human DNA
[3:02:20.400 --> 3:02:22.400]  and they want to talk and barrel.
[3:02:22.400 --> 3:02:24.400]  It's just like, you know,
[3:02:24.400 --> 3:02:26.400]  Gates is on record as saying
[3:02:26.400 --> 3:02:28.400]  that he wants to dim the sun.
[3:02:28.400 --> 3:02:30.400]  Mike Adams said, Bill Gates wants to kill photosynthesis.
[3:02:30.400 --> 3:02:32.400]  But even going...
[3:02:32.400 --> 3:02:34.400]  So just as God destroyed the world with water
[3:02:34.400 --> 3:02:36.400]  because we interbred,
[3:02:36.400 --> 3:02:38.400]  they're like, aha, we're interbreeding you
[3:02:38.400 --> 3:02:40.400]  all with a shot.
[3:02:40.400 --> 3:02:42.400]  It's not like your wife laid down with this creature.
[3:02:42.400 --> 3:02:44.400]  We are literally doing it to you now.
[3:02:44.400 --> 3:02:46.400]  We're taking over. It's an alien takeover.
[3:02:46.400 --> 3:02:48.400]  Right, and that's the thing.
[3:02:48.400 --> 3:02:50.400]  The actual, it's genetic.
[3:02:50.400 --> 3:02:52.400]  They've extracted all the DNA
[3:02:52.400 --> 3:02:54.400]  of the aliens.
[3:02:54.400 --> 3:02:56.400]  And I know that, you know,
[3:02:56.400 --> 3:02:58.400]  just like on that clip you were showing
[3:02:58.400 --> 3:03:00.400]  with Twilight Zone,
[3:03:00.400 --> 3:03:02.400]  the alien was a giant.
[3:03:02.400 --> 3:03:04.400]  I mean, Barry Comeish,
[3:03:04.400 --> 3:03:06.400]  he talked about the UFOs
[3:03:06.400 --> 3:03:08.400]  over the Holy Land and they were giants
[3:03:08.400 --> 3:03:10.400]  nine feet.
[3:03:10.400 --> 3:03:12.400]  So here's the thing.
[3:03:12.400 --> 3:03:14.400]  I can't convince people
[3:03:14.400 --> 3:03:16.400]  that they want,
[3:03:16.400 --> 3:03:18.400]  but why would you take anything
[3:03:18.400 --> 3:03:20.400]  that isn't even
[3:03:20.400 --> 3:03:22.400]  offered as a vaccine?
[3:03:22.400 --> 3:03:24.400]  And why would you take, in essence,
[3:03:24.400 --> 3:03:26.400]  gene therapy of unproven
[3:03:26.400 --> 3:03:28.400]  efficacy
[3:03:28.400 --> 3:03:30.400]  of that was rushed in world record
[3:03:30.400 --> 3:03:32.400]  time? Usual vaccines take
[3:03:32.400 --> 3:03:34.400]  four years. And why is Pfizer now
[3:03:34.400 --> 3:03:36.400]  claiming if
[3:03:36.400 --> 3:03:38.400]  countries use their vaccine?
[3:03:38.400 --> 3:03:40.400]  They want the countries, Brazil, Argentina
[3:03:40.400 --> 3:03:42.400]  to give them all their natural resources
[3:03:42.400 --> 3:03:44.400]  in case they get sued.
[3:03:44.400 --> 3:03:46.400]  They want to have
[3:03:46.400 --> 3:03:48.400]  coverage. And Alex, here's the deal.
[3:03:48.400 --> 3:03:50.400]  What the fallen angels did
[3:03:50.400 --> 3:03:52.400]  before the flood and after the flood,
[3:03:52.400 --> 3:03:54.400]  the flood of Noah, they said there were
[3:03:54.400 --> 3:03:56.400]  giants in those days and after the
[3:03:56.400 --> 3:03:58.400]  days, those days,
[3:03:58.400 --> 3:04:00.400]  it's the greatest cover up in history
[3:04:00.400 --> 3:04:02.400]  and covered over. I have, actually,
[3:04:02.400 --> 3:04:04.400]  I witnessed testimony
[3:04:04.400 --> 3:04:06.400]  from a gentleman who's very famous.
[3:04:06.400 --> 3:04:08.400]  I won't tell his name, but he's on
[3:04:08.400 --> 3:04:10.400]  a DVD. I think you guys,
[3:04:10.400 --> 3:04:12.400]  if you don't sell him, you should. It's called
[3:04:12.400 --> 3:04:14.400]  Egyptions in the Grand Canyon.
[3:04:14.400 --> 3:04:16.400]  The bottom line is, is that
[3:04:16.400 --> 3:04:18.400]  the giants and
[3:04:18.400 --> 3:04:20.400]  the bones of the giants are in the
[3:04:20.400 --> 3:04:22.400]  Smithsonian. The Smithsonian denies
[3:04:22.400 --> 3:04:24.400]  over 300
[3:04:24.400 --> 3:04:26.400]  cases of where giant bones,
[3:04:26.400 --> 3:04:28.400]  giant skulls, and giant
[3:04:28.400 --> 3:04:30.400]  mummies were returned or given
[3:04:30.400 --> 3:04:32.400]  to them. It's like all the mounds
[3:04:32.400 --> 3:04:34.400]  in the Midwest. All that stuff
[3:04:34.400 --> 3:04:36.400]  went to Smithsonian. They go, we know that.
[3:04:36.400 --> 3:04:38.400]  And so that's all the secret societies that
[3:04:38.400 --> 3:04:40.400]  suppress all this. And so they made a deal
[3:04:40.400 --> 3:04:42.400]  with these inter-dimensionals. Does the
[3:04:42.400 --> 3:04:44.400]  globalists actually believe they're going to get live extension
[3:04:44.400 --> 3:04:46.400]  and all this if they sell us out?
[3:04:46.400 --> 3:04:48.400]  Absolutely. Because the same
[3:04:48.400 --> 3:04:50.400]  promise that Satan made to Eve
[3:04:50.400 --> 3:04:52.400]  in the Garden of Eden, you shall not
[3:04:52.400 --> 3:04:54.400]  surely die. So what's
[3:04:54.400 --> 3:04:56.400]  the transhumanist mantra?
[3:04:56.400 --> 3:04:58.400]  You shall not
[3:04:58.400 --> 3:05:00.400]  surely die. It works so good
[3:05:00.400 --> 3:05:02.400]  before the flood. It's working great after the
[3:05:02.400 --> 3:05:04.400]  flood. And now, the
[3:05:04.400 --> 3:05:06.400]  globalists say they're doing it. They're being promised live extension. It's all about that.
[3:05:06.400 --> 3:05:08.400]  Right. They'll never die.
[3:05:08.400 --> 3:05:10.400]  And they basically get to live forever.
[3:05:10.400 --> 3:05:12.400]  And they get to be, you know,
[3:05:12.400 --> 3:05:14.400]  every Marvel comic book character,
[3:05:14.400 --> 3:05:16.400]  all the powers, all the superpowers,
[3:05:16.400 --> 3:05:18.400]  travel wherever.
[3:05:18.400 --> 3:05:20.400]  They all ask for project, this part of the universe.
[3:05:20.400 --> 3:05:22.400]  What they're doing is making
[3:05:22.400 --> 3:05:24.400]  their world in the
[3:05:24.400 --> 3:05:26.400]  image and likeness of fallen man
[3:05:26.400 --> 3:05:28.400]  and their king, who is
[3:05:28.400 --> 3:05:30.400]  called Lucifer. By the way, the Satan
[3:05:30.400 --> 3:05:32.400]  worshipers, that's on one level.
[3:05:32.400 --> 3:05:34.400]  All of the people, you and I talk about
[3:05:34.400 --> 3:05:36.400]  the globalists, they call
[3:05:36.400 --> 3:05:38.400]  Lord Lucifer. Lucifer became
[3:05:38.400 --> 3:05:40.400]  Satan when he got here.
[3:05:40.400 --> 3:05:42.400]  All right, Steve, well, amazing interview.
[3:05:42.400 --> 3:05:44.400]  Thank you so much for your great work. We really appreciate you.
[3:05:44.400 --> 3:05:46.400]  Thank you, Alex.
[3:05:46.400 --> 3:05:48.400]  Powerful information. That's what the
[3:05:48.400 --> 3:05:50.400]  globalists believe. You can sit there and play games all day. That's what
[3:05:50.400 --> 3:05:52.400]  they're doing. That's why they're doing all this.
[3:05:52.400 --> 3:05:54.400]  And they believe they're bringing the devil
[3:05:54.400 --> 3:05:56.400]  onto earth, emerging with humans
[3:05:56.400 --> 3:05:58.400]  to create this
[3:05:58.400 --> 3:06:00.400]  as they, as they hell Satan.
[3:06:00.400 --> 3:06:02.400]  So I want to thank you all for your
[3:06:02.400 --> 3:06:04.400]  support. We have the great
[3:06:04.400 --> 3:06:06.400]  John Rappaport
[3:06:06.400 --> 3:06:08.400]  about to take over. Don't forget, until
[3:06:08.400 --> 3:06:10.400]  Saturday you can get
[3:06:10.400 --> 3:06:12.400]  10% off and free shipping on
[3:06:12.400 --> 3:06:14.400]  frugal food.
[3:06:14.400 --> 3:06:16.400]  Free shipping on frugal food is so huge because it's the biggest part of the cost of the food
[3:06:16.400 --> 3:06:18.400]  is the shipping. That is an unprecedented deal.
[3:06:18.400 --> 3:06:20.400]  It's going to end in just a few days.
[3:06:20.400 --> 3:06:22.400]  infowarstore.com. And we have the
[3:06:22.400 --> 3:06:24.400]  new incredible sleep aid. When I say incredible,
[3:06:24.400 --> 3:06:26.400]  it's really, really strong. It's like
[3:06:26.400 --> 3:06:28.400]  rocket respite liquid. It's down and out.
[3:06:28.400 --> 3:06:30.400]  Four milligrams of
[3:06:30.400 --> 3:06:32.400]  melatonin, L-tripped
[3:06:32.400 --> 3:06:34.400]  pan, valerian root just goes on from there.
[3:06:34.400 --> 3:06:36.400]  40% off
[3:06:36.400 --> 3:06:38.400]  infowarstore.com. And it funds our operation.
[3:06:38.400 --> 3:06:40.400]  There's not a more revolutionary thing you can do.
[3:06:40.400 --> 3:06:42.400]  John Rappaport takes over.
[3:06:44.400 --> 3:06:46.400]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[3:06:46.400 --> 3:06:48.400]  It's very bittersweet.
[3:06:48.400 --> 3:06:50.400]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[3:06:50.400 --> 3:06:52.400]  And now we have a lot of credibility,
[3:06:52.400 --> 3:06:54.400]  but I don't care about that. I care about beating the new world
[3:06:54.400 --> 3:06:56.400]  order. And it's because we have
[3:06:56.400 --> 3:06:58.400]  so much credibility, they can't allow us
[3:06:58.400 --> 3:07:00.400]  to stay on air much longer. And I
[3:07:00.400 --> 3:07:02.400]  don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us.
[3:07:02.400 --> 3:07:04.400]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on.
[3:07:04.400 --> 3:07:06.400]  But let's just say this.
[3:07:06.400 --> 3:07:08.400]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[3:07:08.400 --> 3:07:10.400]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[3:07:10.400 --> 3:07:12.400]  So please pray for us and please buy
[3:07:12.400 --> 3:07:14.400]  the products. And infowarstore.com.
[3:07:14.400 --> 3:07:16.400]  They're great products. Plus they fund the operation.
[3:07:16.400 --> 3:07:18.400]  So you know, unlike other products
[3:07:18.400 --> 3:07:20.400]  you can buy, they're still great. Do they fund
[3:07:20.400 --> 3:07:22.400]  freedom? No, a lot of them don't. These are
[3:07:22.400 --> 3:07:24.400]  great products that fund freedom and
[3:07:24.400 --> 3:07:26.400]  fund justice when the whole world
[3:07:26.400 --> 3:07:28.400]  is waking up and looking for truth.
[3:07:28.400 --> 3:07:30.400]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[3:07:30.400 --> 3:07:32.400]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people
[3:07:32.400 --> 3:07:34.400]  like us on the air. So while you're at it
[3:07:34.400 --> 3:07:36.400]  don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[3:07:36.400 --> 3:07:38.400]  Download everything we've done. You can
[3:07:38.400 --> 3:07:40.400]  find and save it. Because who knows how long
[3:07:40.400 --> 3:07:42.400]  we're going to be on the air and the enemy is
[3:07:42.400 --> 3:07:44.400]  trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[3:07:44.400 --> 3:07:46.400]  Listers ask me all the time, why do you
[3:07:46.400 --> 3:07:48.400]  have multiple multivitamins?
[3:07:48.400 --> 3:07:50.400]  Why do you have multiple high-quality
[3:07:50.400 --> 3:07:52.400]  iodines? Why do you do that? Because
[3:07:52.400 --> 3:07:54.400]  different strokes for different folks.
[3:07:54.400 --> 3:07:56.400]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists
[3:07:56.400 --> 3:07:58.400]  who say, hey, a lot of people love
[3:07:58.400 --> 3:08:00.400]  deep-earth pure crystal iodine.
[3:08:00.400 --> 3:08:02.400]  You should put one out with deeper crystal iodine
[3:08:02.400 --> 3:08:04.400]  and the two other types because some people
[3:08:04.400 --> 3:08:06.400]  can't absorb pure iodine.
[3:08:06.400 --> 3:08:08.400]  Boom, we did it. It's popular. It's
[3:08:08.400 --> 3:08:10.400]  X3. Is it better than X2? You decide.
[3:08:10.400 --> 3:08:12.400]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[3:08:12.400 --> 3:08:14.400]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out
[3:08:14.400 --> 3:08:16.400]  our very popular powdered pill
[3:08:16.400 --> 3:08:18.400]  sleep aid. And that is down
[3:08:18.400 --> 3:08:20.400]  and out. It's super strong, way
[3:08:20.400 --> 3:08:22.400]  stronger than knock out, but they don't
[3:08:22.400 --> 3:08:24.400]  compete with each other. Different strokes
[3:08:24.400 --> 3:08:26.400]  for different folks, different formulas.
[3:08:26.400 --> 3:08:28.400]  And it's 40% off out of the gates
[3:08:28.400 --> 3:08:30.400]  at M4store.com and free shipping.
[3:08:30.400 --> 3:08:32.400]  Secure your down and out today and while
[3:08:32.400 --> 3:08:34.400]  you're sleeping, you know you're funding the
[3:08:34.400 --> 3:08:36.400]  M4 at the same time. Down and out exclusively
[3:08:36.400 --> 3:08:38.400]  available at M4store.com or 40% off
[3:08:38.400 --> 3:09:04.400]  and for shipping.
[3:09:04.400 --> 3:09:06.400]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[3:09:06.400 --> 3:09:08.400]  you are the resistance.
[3:09:08.400 --> 3:09:11.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:09:11.400 --> 3:09:14.400]  And now your host, John
[3:09:14.400 --> 3:09:16.400]  Rappaport.
[3:09:16.400 --> 3:09:18.400]  Okay folks, here we are with
[3:09:18.400 --> 3:09:20.400]  the stacked stories ready to go.
[3:09:20.400 --> 3:09:22.400]  And
[3:09:22.400 --> 3:09:24.400]  I want to start off with
[3:09:24.400 --> 3:09:26.400]  Joe Biden today because
[3:09:26.400 --> 3:09:28.400]  he is sitting
[3:09:28.400 --> 3:09:30.400]  in the Oval Office.
[3:09:30.400 --> 3:09:32.400]  And there's a new report out
[3:09:32.400 --> 3:09:34.400]  stating that
[3:09:34.400 --> 3:09:36.400]  according to the
[3:09:36.400 --> 3:09:38.400]  Biden
[3:09:38.400 --> 3:09:40.400]  immigration plan
[3:09:40.400 --> 3:09:42.400]  in the next 10 years or so
[3:09:42.400 --> 3:09:44.400]  there will be enough new immigrants
[3:09:44.400 --> 3:09:46.400]  coming into the country
[3:09:46.400 --> 3:09:48.400]  to fill up the present
[3:09:48.400 --> 3:09:50.400]  population of California.
[3:09:52.400 --> 3:09:54.400]  That's a lot of people.
[3:09:54.400 --> 3:09:56.400]  Equal to the
[3:09:56.400 --> 3:09:58.400]  present population of California
[3:09:58.400 --> 3:10:00.400]  into the U.S.
[3:10:00.400 --> 3:10:02.400]  Okay?
[3:10:02.400 --> 3:10:04.400]  So let's just stick
[3:10:04.400 --> 3:10:06.400]  to
[3:10:06.400 --> 3:10:08.400]  the official
[3:10:08.400 --> 3:10:10.400]  version of what COVID-19
[3:10:10.400 --> 3:10:12.400]  is.
[3:10:12.400 --> 3:10:14.400]  You all know that I've been talking about this
[3:10:14.400 --> 3:10:16.400]  the last year,
[3:10:16.400 --> 3:10:18.400]  rejecting every piece of the official
[3:10:18.400 --> 3:10:20.400]  story about COVID-19.
[3:10:20.400 --> 3:10:22.400]  But for the purposes of this conversation
[3:10:22.400 --> 3:10:24.400]  let's assume that the official
[3:10:24.400 --> 3:10:26.400]  story is completely correct
[3:10:26.400 --> 3:10:28.400]  about the virus and the contagion,
[3:10:28.400 --> 3:10:30.400]  the transmission and so forth.
[3:10:30.400 --> 3:10:32.400]  Letting in
[3:10:32.400 --> 3:10:34.400]  enough
[3:10:34.400 --> 3:10:36.400]  immigrants
[3:10:36.400 --> 3:10:38.400]  to fill up the state of California
[3:10:38.400 --> 3:10:40.400]  in the next year
[3:10:40.400 --> 3:10:42.400]  is going to loose
[3:10:42.400 --> 3:10:44.400]  a new plague
[3:10:44.400 --> 3:10:46.400]  on the country of COVID-19.
[3:10:46.400 --> 3:10:48.400]  No way around. I mean, it's not like
[3:10:48.400 --> 3:10:50.400]  wow, maybe, no, no, no, no,
[3:10:50.400 --> 3:10:52.400]  no, no, no.
[3:10:52.400 --> 3:10:54.400]  There is absolutely no way
[3:10:56.400 --> 3:10:58.400]  that you would be able to station enough
[3:10:58.400 --> 3:11:00.400]  medical personnel
[3:11:00.400 --> 3:11:02.400]  at the borders
[3:11:02.400 --> 3:11:04.400]  in order to
[3:11:04.400 --> 3:11:06.400]  test all these people,
[3:11:06.400 --> 3:11:08.400]  trace them, contact them,
[3:11:08.400 --> 3:11:10.400]  track them,
[3:11:10.400 --> 3:11:12.400]  vaccinate them, etc, etc, etc.
[3:11:12.400 --> 3:11:14.400]  I mean, it wouldn't even be close.
[3:11:16.400 --> 3:11:18.400]  So here's
[3:11:18.400 --> 3:11:20.400]  Biden on the one hand saying,
[3:11:20.400 --> 3:11:22.400]  oh, we have to fight the pandemic
[3:11:22.400 --> 3:11:24.400]  and I'm doing everything possible
[3:11:24.400 --> 3:11:26.400]  and everybody has to wear six masks
[3:11:26.400 --> 3:11:28.400]  and say with this dark
[3:11:28.400 --> 3:11:30.400]  winter, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3:11:30.400 --> 3:11:32.400]  And on the other hand, he's saying
[3:11:32.400 --> 3:11:34.400]  open up the whole country,
[3:11:34.400 --> 3:11:36.400]  going to spread
[3:11:36.400 --> 3:11:38.400]  the plague
[3:11:38.400 --> 3:11:40.400]  as far and wide as possible.
[3:11:42.400 --> 3:11:44.400]  Impeach them.
[3:11:44.400 --> 3:11:46.400]  I mean, if any Republicans
[3:11:46.400 --> 3:11:48.400]  in the Congress
[3:11:48.400 --> 3:11:50.400]  who believe in the official COVID
[3:11:50.400 --> 3:11:52.400]  story, have any balls at all,
[3:11:52.400 --> 3:11:54.400]  they would immediately initiate
[3:11:54.400 --> 3:11:56.400]  impeachment proceedings
[3:11:56.400 --> 3:11:58.400]  and publicize it from here to the moon
[3:11:58.400 --> 3:12:00.400]  in the press as to why.
[3:12:00.400 --> 3:12:02.400]  Because this
[3:12:02.400 --> 3:12:04.400]  predatory idiot sitting in the oval
[3:12:04.400 --> 3:12:06.400]  while claiming
[3:12:06.400 --> 3:12:08.400]  to fight the plague
[3:12:08.400 --> 3:12:10.400]  is loosing a new level
[3:12:10.400 --> 3:12:12.400]  of the plague.
[3:12:12.400 --> 3:12:14.400]  Could it be any clearer than that?
[3:12:14.400 --> 3:12:16.400]  No.
[3:12:16.400 --> 3:12:18.400]  It couldn't be.
[3:12:18.400 --> 3:12:20.400]  Now, of course, nobody on the left
[3:12:20.400 --> 3:12:22.400]  is going to admit this. Oh, well, we have to open
[3:12:22.400 --> 3:12:24.400]  the borders because
[3:12:24.400 --> 3:12:26.400]  we have to virtual signal everybody that
[3:12:26.400 --> 3:12:28.400]  it's one world and there's no borders
[3:12:28.400 --> 3:12:30.400]  and we erase everything and
[3:12:30.400 --> 3:12:32.400]  get rid of all the borders and all the protests
[3:12:32.400 --> 3:12:34.400]  and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3:12:34.400 --> 3:12:36.400]  Erase borders, one nation, one world,
[3:12:36.400 --> 3:12:38.400]  one planet.
[3:12:38.400 --> 3:12:40.400]  You're all working for the globalists
[3:12:40.400 --> 3:12:42.400]  and you don't even know it.
[3:12:42.400 --> 3:12:44.400]  But
[3:12:44.400 --> 3:12:46.400]  at the same time,
[3:12:46.400 --> 3:12:48.400]  your boy in the White House
[3:12:48.400 --> 3:12:50.400]  since you believe
[3:12:50.400 --> 3:12:52.400]  this story about COVID,
[3:12:52.400 --> 3:12:54.400]  you would have to believe that he is loosing
[3:12:54.400 --> 3:12:56.400]  an entirely new
[3:12:56.400 --> 3:12:58.400]  level of plague
[3:12:58.400 --> 3:13:00.400]  upon the country
[3:13:00.400 --> 3:13:02.400]  and devastating it beyond all
[3:13:02.400 --> 3:13:04.400]  recognition.
[3:13:06.400 --> 3:13:08.400]  Impeach him.
[3:13:08.400 --> 3:13:10.400]  Let's go.
[3:13:16.400 --> 3:13:18.400]  It's not hard to understand.
[3:13:18.400 --> 3:13:20.400]  I mean, come on.
[3:13:20.400 --> 3:13:22.400]  Not hard to understand at all.
[3:13:26.400 --> 3:13:28.400]  Except for idiots.
[3:13:28.400 --> 3:13:30.400]  Now,
[3:13:30.400 --> 3:13:32.400]  story number two, there's a new
[3:13:32.400 --> 3:13:34.400]  incitement rule in the land
[3:13:34.400 --> 3:13:36.400]  in case you haven't noticed.
[3:13:36.400 --> 3:13:38.400]  Anything
[3:13:38.400 --> 3:13:40.400]  can now be called an incitement
[3:13:40.400 --> 3:13:42.400]  to violence,
[3:13:42.400 --> 3:13:44.400]  revolution, insurrection,
[3:13:44.400 --> 3:13:46.400]  whatever.
[3:13:46.400 --> 3:13:48.400]  And it's kind of interesting
[3:13:48.400 --> 3:13:50.400]  for anybody that has
[3:13:50.400 --> 3:13:52.400]  any public presence
[3:13:52.400 --> 3:13:54.400]  at all
[3:13:54.400 --> 3:13:56.400]  to think back
[3:13:56.400 --> 3:13:58.400]  on statements and remarks that
[3:13:58.400 --> 3:14:00.400]  he's made over the past months and years
[3:14:00.400 --> 3:14:02.400]  and so forth. And how
[3:14:02.400 --> 3:14:04.400]  any of these remarks, or many of them
[3:14:04.400 --> 3:14:06.400]  could be taken now
[3:14:06.400 --> 3:14:08.400]  by the
[3:14:08.400 --> 3:14:10.400]  Stasi
[3:14:10.400 --> 3:14:12.400]  and, you know, Gestapo
[3:14:12.400 --> 3:14:14.400]  of the police state
[3:14:14.400 --> 3:14:16.400]  to be incitement
[3:14:16.400 --> 3:14:18.400]  to insurrection, revolution,
[3:14:18.400 --> 3:14:20.400]  murder, death,
[3:14:20.400 --> 3:14:22.400]  whatever, you know,
[3:14:22.400 --> 3:14:24.400]  because that's the operation.
[3:14:24.400 --> 3:14:26.400]  That's what they're doing.
[3:14:28.400 --> 3:14:30.400]  If you were in Washington, D.C.
[3:14:30.400 --> 3:14:32.400]  at the big Trump rally
[3:14:32.400 --> 3:14:34.400]  when the Capitol break-in occurred
[3:14:34.400 --> 3:14:36.400]  and you happen to have
[3:14:36.400 --> 3:14:38.400]  an account at Bank of America
[3:14:38.400 --> 3:14:40.400]  and a photo
[3:14:40.400 --> 3:14:42.400]  of you from some drone
[3:14:42.400 --> 3:14:44.400]  and whatever is matched up
[3:14:44.400 --> 3:14:46.400]  to that account number, which
[3:14:46.400 --> 3:14:48.400]  apparently be of a release
[3:14:48.400 --> 3:14:50.400]  to the authorities,
[3:14:50.400 --> 3:14:52.400]  oh, that
[3:14:52.400 --> 3:14:54.400]  isn't even a statement.
[3:14:54.400 --> 3:14:56.400]  You know, your presence
[3:14:56.400 --> 3:14:58.400]  becomes incite.
[3:14:58.400 --> 3:15:00.400]  You were there.
[3:15:00.400 --> 3:15:02.400]  Therefore, you must have had
[3:15:02.400 --> 3:15:04.400]  something to do with the Capitol break-in.
[3:15:04.400 --> 3:15:06.400]  I mean, of course.
[3:15:06.400 --> 3:15:08.400]  Or if you were planning to go,
[3:15:08.400 --> 3:15:10.400]  or if you told somebody to go,
[3:15:10.400 --> 3:15:12.400]  or if you said, wow,
[3:15:12.400 --> 3:15:14.400]  this rally is going to be a great
[3:15:14.400 --> 3:15:16.400]  that's incite.
[3:15:16.400 --> 3:15:18.400]  Or if you said,
[3:15:20.400 --> 3:15:22.400]  meet you there,
[3:15:22.400 --> 3:15:24.400]  oh, if you said
[3:15:24.400 --> 3:15:26.400]  stay strong, strong, what does that mean?
[3:15:26.400 --> 3:15:28.400]  That means fight, that means
[3:15:28.400 --> 3:15:30.400]  break the law, that means
[3:15:30.400 --> 3:15:32.400]  revolution, that means kill people,
[3:15:32.400 --> 3:15:34.400]  that means overthrow the government,
[3:15:34.400 --> 3:15:36.400]  etc, etc, etc.
[3:15:36.400 --> 3:15:38.400]  That's the new incitement
[3:15:38.400 --> 3:15:40.400]  rule.
[3:15:40.400 --> 3:15:42.400]  Which, if you look at
[3:15:42.400 --> 3:15:44.400]  legal cases, in case anybody
[3:15:44.400 --> 3:15:46.400]  is interested vaguely
[3:15:46.400 --> 3:15:48.400]  in such a
[3:15:48.400 --> 3:15:50.400]  arcane thing
[3:15:50.400 --> 3:15:52.400]  as legal precedent, you find
[3:15:52.400 --> 3:15:54.400]  that incitement
[3:15:54.400 --> 3:15:56.400]  fails over and over again because
[3:15:56.400 --> 3:15:58.400]  the people making the charge
[3:15:58.400 --> 3:16:00.400]  are insane.
[3:16:00.400 --> 3:16:02.400]  As simple as that. They're trying
[3:16:02.400 --> 3:16:04.400]  to tie things together
[3:16:04.400 --> 3:16:06.400]  that don't go together.
[3:16:06.400 --> 3:16:08.400]  You know,
[3:16:08.400 --> 3:16:10.400]  the guy ate a pear, he threw
[3:16:10.400 --> 3:16:12.400]  the core away, it hit somebody
[3:16:12.400 --> 3:16:14.400]  on the ankle, they stumbled
[3:16:14.400 --> 3:16:16.400]  and knocked into somebody else
[3:16:16.400 --> 3:16:18.400]  and he fell into a
[3:16:18.400 --> 3:16:20.400]  phone booth and then
[3:16:20.400 --> 3:16:22.400]  the phone booth trickled a little bit
[3:16:22.400 --> 3:16:24.400]  and a guy driving his car down the street
[3:16:24.400 --> 3:16:26.400]  who saw the phone booth shaking a little bit
[3:16:26.400 --> 3:16:28.400]  thought it was an earthquake
[3:16:28.400 --> 3:16:30.400]  and so he pulled his car
[3:16:30.400 --> 3:16:32.400]  into a plate glass window
[3:16:32.400 --> 3:16:34.400]  because he was terrified
[3:16:34.400 --> 3:16:36.400]  and he happened to
[3:16:36.400 --> 3:16:38.400]  break the leg of somebody
[3:16:38.400 --> 3:16:40.400]  and that person can now sue
[3:16:40.400 --> 3:16:42.400]  the guy who ate the pear
[3:16:42.400 --> 3:16:44.400]  that caused the ankle, a babbit, a babbit,
[3:16:44.400 --> 3:16:46.400]  a b-b-bob.
[3:16:46.400 --> 3:16:48.400]  That's the incitement
[3:16:48.400 --> 3:16:50.400]  argument and it fails
[3:16:50.400 --> 3:16:52.400]  over and over again except that the press
[3:16:52.400 --> 3:16:54.400]  wants
[3:16:54.400 --> 3:16:56.400]  to incite the incitement
[3:16:56.400 --> 3:16:58.400]  rule as many times
[3:16:58.400 --> 3:17:00.400]  as possible to blame
[3:17:00.400 --> 3:17:04.400]  as many people as possible
[3:17:04.400 --> 3:17:06.400]  who might not be accepting
[3:17:06.400 --> 3:17:08.400]  the globalist agenda
[3:17:08.400 --> 3:17:10.400]  to be labeled as criminals
[3:17:10.400 --> 3:17:12.400]  and domestic terrorists
[3:17:12.400 --> 3:17:14.400]  because after all
[3:17:14.400 --> 3:17:16.400]  anybody who incites
[3:17:16.400 --> 3:17:18.400]  must be a terrorist, right?
[3:17:18.400 --> 3:17:20.400]  So we need a new bill
[3:17:20.400 --> 3:17:22.400]  and in fact
[3:17:22.400 --> 3:17:24.400]  if you look at
[3:17:24.400 --> 3:17:26.400]  the bill that has now been
[3:17:26.400 --> 3:17:28.400]  pending I think since
[3:17:28.400 --> 3:17:30.400]  2019
[3:17:30.400 --> 3:17:32.400]  in the Congress
[3:17:32.400 --> 3:17:34.400]  I think it's Adam Schiff's bill
[3:17:34.400 --> 3:17:36.400]  if you actually read it
[3:17:36.400 --> 3:17:38.400]  you'll see that all kinds of people
[3:17:38.400 --> 3:17:40.400]  could be incited as terrorists
[3:17:40.400 --> 3:18:00.400]  after the break.
[3:18:10.400 --> 3:18:12.400]  It's a bill that's
[3:18:12.400 --> 3:18:14.400]  being used as a weapon
[3:18:14.400 --> 3:18:16.400]  to then have us under such a crisis
[3:18:16.400 --> 3:18:18.400]  under such a load
[3:18:18.400 --> 3:18:20.400]  capitulate to the UN
[3:18:20.400 --> 3:18:22.400]  whatever agreements they want us to sign
[3:18:22.400 --> 3:18:24.400]  hoping that they will stop the flood
[3:18:24.400 --> 3:18:26.400]  of tens of millions of refugees
[3:18:26.400 --> 3:18:28.400]  not fleeing COVID
[3:18:28.400 --> 3:18:30.400]  or climate change
[3:18:30.400 --> 3:18:32.400]  as the UN and Klaus Schwabber is saying
[3:18:32.400 --> 3:18:34.400]  and Bill Gates is saying
[3:18:34.400 --> 3:18:36.400]  but fleeing the year-long
[3:18:36.400 --> 3:18:38.400]  lockdowns
[3:18:38.400 --> 3:18:40.400]  and that's why we have to really
[3:18:40.400 --> 3:18:42.400]  get educated about the globalist.
[3:18:42.400 --> 3:18:44.400]  We're shooting this
[3:18:44.400 --> 3:18:46.400]  on the evening of Monday
[3:18:46.400 --> 3:18:48.400]  March 1st, 2021
[3:18:48.400 --> 3:18:50.400]  and in just six days this Saturday
[3:18:50.400 --> 3:18:52.400]  the biggest sale ever
[3:18:52.400 --> 3:18:54.400]  on storeable food is going to end
[3:18:54.400 --> 3:18:56.400]  because of the ice storms and the problems around the country
[3:18:56.400 --> 3:18:58.400]  our big supplier, highest quality storeable food
[3:18:58.400 --> 3:19:00.400]  at the lowest price, my patriot
[3:19:00.400 --> 3:19:02.400]  is giving us the best deal ever
[3:19:02.400 --> 3:19:04.400]  free shipping on all of their storeable food
[3:19:04.400 --> 3:19:06.400]  that's a big cost of storeable food
[3:19:06.400 --> 3:19:08.400]  because it weighs a lot
[3:19:08.400 --> 3:19:10.400]  and 10% off on top of it
[3:19:10.400 --> 3:19:12.400]  you won't see this deal come along for a long, long time
[3:19:12.400 --> 3:19:14.400]  you've got until this Saturday
[3:19:14.400 --> 3:19:16.400]  the 6th of March, 2021
[3:19:16.400 --> 3:19:18.400]  and then contractually they have to end the sale
[3:19:18.400 --> 3:19:20.400]  because they have hundreds of distributors
[3:19:20.400 --> 3:19:22.400]  and they're getting mad that we're undercutting the price
[3:19:22.400 --> 3:19:24.400]  so they decided to do this
[3:19:24.400 --> 3:19:26.400]  so it's exclusively available
[3:19:26.400 --> 3:19:28.400]  there's a few days left at infowarstore.com
[3:19:28.400 --> 3:19:30.400]  or parallelics.com
[3:19:30.400 --> 3:19:32.400]  takes you right to specials
[3:19:32.400 --> 3:19:34.400]  all their food, all their packages
[3:19:34.400 --> 3:19:36.400]  take advantage of it now
[3:19:36.400 --> 3:20:04.400]  the resistance.video
[3:20:04.400 --> 3:20:06.400]  we launched have been banned
[3:20:06.400 --> 3:20:08.400]  that's why every month we launch
[3:20:08.400 --> 3:20:10.400]  a new URL
[3:20:10.400 --> 3:20:12.400]  before they ban it
[3:20:12.400 --> 3:20:14.400]  but Soros and Bill Gates
[3:20:14.400 --> 3:20:16.400]  and the globalists are on our tail
[3:20:16.400 --> 3:20:18.400]  but the new website is
[3:20:18.400 --> 3:20:20.400]  theresistance.video
[3:20:20.400 --> 3:20:22.400]  theresistance.video
[3:20:22.400 --> 3:20:24.400]  they're trying to block us
[3:20:24.400 --> 3:20:26.400]  because the truth is powerful and can't defeat them
[3:20:26.400 --> 3:20:28.400]  so the new URL
[3:20:28.400 --> 3:20:30.400]  that links right to banned.video
[3:20:30.400 --> 3:20:32.400]  and all of our videos
[3:20:32.400 --> 3:20:34.400]  and all the special reports
[3:20:34.400 --> 3:20:36.400]  and all the suppressed information
[3:20:36.400 --> 3:20:38.400]  is that theresistance.video
[3:20:38.400 --> 3:20:40.400]  share the link
[3:20:40.400 --> 3:20:42.400]  theresistance.video
[3:20:42.400 --> 3:20:44.400]  theresistance.video
[3:20:44.400 --> 3:21:04.400]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:21:04.400 --> 3:21:06.400]  news, analysis reports
[3:21:06.400 --> 3:21:08.400]  it's the Alex Jones show
[3:21:08.400 --> 3:21:14.400]  and now your host, John Rappaport
[3:21:14.400 --> 3:21:16.400]  so if you look at this
[3:21:16.400 --> 3:21:18.400]  terrorism bill by Adam Schiff
[3:21:18.400 --> 3:21:20.400]  that's been sitting there
[3:21:20.400 --> 3:21:22.400]  I think for a couple years now
[3:21:22.400 --> 3:21:24.400]  and people are oh yeah
[3:21:24.400 --> 3:21:26.400]  we need a domestic terrorism bill
[3:21:26.400 --> 3:21:28.400]  if you actually read the thing
[3:21:28.400 --> 3:21:30.400]  you'll see a section where they talk about
[3:21:30.400 --> 3:21:32.400]  how destruction of property
[3:21:32.400 --> 3:21:34.400]  destruction of property
[3:21:34.400 --> 3:21:36.400]  as a means of intimidation
[3:21:36.400 --> 3:21:38.400]  intimidation
[3:21:38.400 --> 3:21:40.400]  could be considered
[3:21:40.400 --> 3:21:42.400]  an actor of domestic terrorism
[3:21:42.400 --> 3:21:44.400]  so I suggested some people
[3:21:44.400 --> 3:21:46.400]  from Black Lives Matter and Antifa
[3:21:46.400 --> 3:21:48.400]  interview Adam Schiff
[3:21:48.400 --> 3:21:50.400]  and ask him what's going on here
[3:21:50.400 --> 3:21:52.400]  because obviously
[3:21:52.400 --> 3:21:54.400]  they would be the first target
[3:21:54.400 --> 3:21:56.400]  of any domestic terrorism bill
[3:21:56.400 --> 3:21:58.400]  according to the definition
[3:21:58.400 --> 3:22:00.400]  it's not my bill
[3:22:00.400 --> 3:22:02.400]  it's Schiff's bill
[3:22:02.400 --> 3:22:04.400]  he's the author
[3:22:04.400 --> 3:22:06.400]  of a wide application
[3:22:06.400 --> 3:22:08.400]  you bet
[3:22:08.400 --> 3:22:10.400]  look at the thing
[3:22:10.400 --> 3:22:12.400]  understand it
[3:22:12.400 --> 3:22:14.400]  we'll see if it passes
[3:22:14.400 --> 3:22:16.400]  censorship
[3:22:16.400 --> 3:22:18.400]  first I want to talk a little bit
[3:22:18.400 --> 3:22:20.400]  about Texas
[3:22:20.400 --> 3:22:22.400]  I was going to
[3:22:22.400 --> 3:22:24.400]  give some suggestions
[3:22:24.400 --> 3:22:26.400]  to Governor Abbott
[3:22:26.400 --> 3:22:28.400]  but here's the thing about Texas
[3:22:28.400 --> 3:22:30.400]  and South Dakota
[3:22:30.400 --> 3:22:32.400]  and Florida and other states
[3:22:32.400 --> 3:22:34.400]  and so on
[3:22:34.400 --> 3:22:36.400]  part of the unannounced reason
[3:22:36.400 --> 3:22:38.400]  why these states are opening up their economies
[3:22:38.400 --> 3:22:40.400]  or in the case of say South Dakota
[3:22:40.400 --> 3:22:42.400]  never shut them down
[3:22:44.400 --> 3:22:46.400]  is because of the people
[3:22:46.400 --> 3:22:48.400]  you
[3:22:48.400 --> 3:22:50.400]  the people who want to keep the economy open
[3:22:50.400 --> 3:22:52.400]  the people who do keep
[3:22:52.400 --> 3:22:54.400]  the economy open
[3:22:54.400 --> 3:22:56.400]  come hell or high water somehow
[3:22:56.400 --> 3:22:58.400]  keep their businesses open
[3:22:58.400 --> 3:23:00.400]  keep commerce flowing
[3:23:00.400 --> 3:23:02.400]  assert
[3:23:02.400 --> 3:23:04.400]  their basic freedoms
[3:23:04.400 --> 3:23:06.400]  under the Constitution
[3:23:06.400 --> 3:23:08.400]  and their natural freedoms
[3:23:08.400 --> 3:23:10.400]  I mean if everybody
[3:23:10.400 --> 3:23:12.400]  were just completely knuckling under
[3:23:12.400 --> 3:23:14.400]  and nobody had anything
[3:23:14.400 --> 3:23:16.400]  in the way of resistance
[3:23:16.400 --> 3:23:18.400]  or outrage
[3:23:18.400 --> 3:23:20.400]  in terms of what they're saying
[3:23:20.400 --> 3:23:22.400]  against the lockdowns and so on
[3:23:22.400 --> 3:23:24.400]  we'd still be all huddling at home right
[3:23:24.400 --> 3:23:26.400]  I mean you know if they could get away with it
[3:23:26.400 --> 3:23:28.400]  they would
[3:23:28.400 --> 3:23:30.400]  get away with this thing as long as possible
[3:23:30.400 --> 3:23:32.400]  and drive everybody into
[3:23:32.400 --> 3:23:34.400]  complete psychosis and death
[3:23:36.400 --> 3:23:38.400]  so let's not overlook that
[3:23:38.400 --> 3:23:40.400]  you know
[3:23:40.400 --> 3:23:42.400]  who is the resistance
[3:23:42.400 --> 3:23:44.400]  you're the resistance
[3:23:44.400 --> 3:23:46.400]  the people are the resistance
[3:23:48.400 --> 3:23:50.400]  and when the people
[3:23:50.400 --> 3:23:52.400]  show enough of the resistance
[3:23:52.400 --> 3:23:54.400]  the leaders get nervous
[3:23:54.400 --> 3:23:56.400]  they get
[3:23:56.400 --> 3:23:58.400]  very nervous
[3:23:58.400 --> 3:24:00.400]  and they begin to magically
[3:24:00.400 --> 3:24:02.400]  find reasons
[3:24:02.400 --> 3:24:04.400]  to open things up
[3:24:04.400 --> 3:24:06.400]  and get right
[3:24:08.400 --> 3:24:10.400]  and I don't want to
[3:24:10.400 --> 3:24:12.400]  ignore this fact and just lay it
[3:24:12.400 --> 3:24:14.400]  all on to well the politicians
[3:24:14.400 --> 3:24:16.400]  are finally coming around and so on
[3:24:16.400 --> 3:24:18.400]  well Kristi Noem
[3:24:18.400 --> 3:24:20.400]  has been there
[3:24:20.400 --> 3:24:22.400]  in the trenches from the beginning
[3:24:22.400 --> 3:24:24.400]  in South Dakota the governor
[3:24:24.400 --> 3:24:26.400]  she has said
[3:24:26.400 --> 3:24:28.400]  there will be no businesses
[3:24:28.400 --> 3:24:30.400]  locking down
[3:24:30.400 --> 3:24:32.400]  there's no lockdown of any kind
[3:24:32.400 --> 3:24:34.400]  and there never will be and there hasn't been
[3:24:34.400 --> 3:24:36.400]  in South Dakota
[3:24:36.400 --> 3:24:38.400]  she's a champ
[3:24:38.400 --> 3:24:40.400]  but everywhere else
[3:24:40.400 --> 3:24:42.400]  it's taken
[3:24:42.400 --> 3:24:44.400]  a lot of activity and resistance
[3:24:44.400 --> 3:24:46.400]  on the part of a whole bunch of people
[3:24:46.400 --> 3:24:48.400]  in order to
[3:24:48.400 --> 3:24:50.400]  force
[3:24:50.400 --> 3:24:52.400]  people leaders to do anything
[3:24:52.400 --> 3:24:54.400]  whatsoever
[3:24:54.400 --> 3:24:56.400]  and if you think
[3:24:56.400 --> 3:24:58.400]  it's over oh everything's great now
[3:24:58.400 --> 3:25:00.400]  forget it
[3:25:00.400 --> 3:25:02.400]  there's a lot more resistance
[3:25:02.400 --> 3:25:04.400]  that's absolutely necessary
[3:25:04.400 --> 3:25:06.400]  and coming up on the horizon
[3:25:06.400 --> 3:25:08.400]  in fact it's here now
[3:25:12.400 --> 3:25:14.400]  all kinds of groups
[3:25:14.400 --> 3:25:16.400]  with clout
[3:25:16.400 --> 3:25:18.400]  and heavy hitters on board
[3:25:18.400 --> 3:25:20.400]  are fashioning
[3:25:20.400 --> 3:25:22.400]  their tools
[3:25:22.400 --> 3:25:24.400]  to implement censorship online
[3:25:24.400 --> 3:25:26.400]  of all types
[3:25:26.400 --> 3:25:28.400]  and kinds from all different vectors
[3:25:28.400 --> 3:25:30.400]  and one of them is an outfit called
[3:25:30.400 --> 3:25:32.400]  News Guard
[3:25:32.400 --> 3:25:34.400]  have you heard of News Guard
[3:25:34.400 --> 3:25:36.400]  everybody
[3:25:36.400 --> 3:25:38.400]  they have a very slick scheme
[3:25:38.400 --> 3:25:40.400]  and you can see articles
[3:25:40.400 --> 3:25:42.400]  here and there
[3:25:42.400 --> 3:25:44.400]  Alex has talked about them for example
[3:25:44.400 --> 3:25:46.400]  and what they do is
[3:25:46.400 --> 3:25:48.400]  they contact you
[3:25:48.400 --> 3:25:50.400]  if you have a website for example
[3:25:50.400 --> 3:25:52.400]  and they say
[3:25:52.400 --> 3:25:54.400]  we have an app you see
[3:25:54.400 --> 3:25:56.400]  or they don't even tell you that
[3:25:56.400 --> 3:25:58.400]  but they do they have an app which
[3:25:58.400 --> 3:26:00.400]  people can sign up for
[3:26:00.400 --> 3:26:02.400]  and if you get their cute little app
[3:26:02.400 --> 3:26:04.400]  then
[3:26:04.400 --> 3:26:06.400]  when you go searching around websites
[3:26:06.400 --> 3:26:08.400]  and so forth
[3:26:08.400 --> 3:26:10.400]  and you decide to open up a site
[3:26:10.400 --> 3:26:12.400]  if they have
[3:26:12.400 --> 3:26:14.400]  according to their ranking system
[3:26:14.400 --> 3:26:16.400]  determine that this website
[3:26:16.400 --> 3:26:18.400]  is unworthy
[3:26:18.400 --> 3:26:20.400]  and unreliable
[3:26:20.400 --> 3:26:22.400]  factually speaking
[3:26:22.400 --> 3:26:24.400]  misinformation etc etc
[3:26:24.400 --> 3:26:26.400]  you will be warned
[3:26:26.400 --> 3:26:28.400]  you can still go there
[3:26:28.400 --> 3:26:30.400]  but they're warned
[3:26:30.400 --> 3:26:32.400]  they got a color coding
[3:26:32.400 --> 3:26:34.400]  blah blah blah
[3:26:34.400 --> 3:26:36.400]  if it's red
[3:26:36.400 --> 3:26:38.400]  and I think
[3:26:38.400 --> 3:26:40.400]  Tom Ridge remember
[3:26:40.400 --> 3:26:42.400]  the
[3:26:42.400 --> 3:26:44.400]  former governor
[3:26:44.400 --> 3:26:46.400]  of Pennsylvania
[3:26:46.400 --> 3:26:48.400]  and wasn't he homeland
[3:26:48.400 --> 3:26:50.400]  security's first director
[3:26:50.400 --> 3:26:52.400]  with the color coding
[3:26:52.400 --> 3:26:54.400]  terrorism
[3:26:54.400 --> 3:26:56.400]  alerts and so on
[3:26:56.400 --> 3:26:58.400]  from what I understand he happens to be
[3:26:58.400 --> 3:27:00.400]  on the board of news guard
[3:27:00.400 --> 3:27:02.400]  right
[3:27:02.400 --> 3:27:04.400]  so they contact you
[3:27:04.400 --> 3:27:06.400]  if you have a website for example
[3:27:06.400 --> 3:27:08.400]  if they think oh
[3:27:08.400 --> 3:27:10.400]  we don't know about this person
[3:27:10.400 --> 3:27:12.400]  they interview you
[3:27:12.400 --> 3:27:14.400]  they want to ask you questions
[3:27:14.400 --> 3:27:16.400]  and then they decide
[3:27:16.400 --> 3:27:18.400]  whether or not you're worthy
[3:27:18.400 --> 3:27:20.400]  or you're unworthy
[3:27:20.400 --> 3:27:22.400]  and they contacted me
[3:27:22.400 --> 3:27:24.400]  at no more fake news
[3:27:24.400 --> 3:27:26.400]  they think
[3:27:26.400 --> 3:27:28.400]  that I'm going to sit down
[3:27:28.400 --> 3:27:30.400]  and actually answer their questions
[3:27:30.400 --> 3:27:32.400]  are you kidding
[3:27:32.400 --> 3:27:34.400]  no my job
[3:27:34.400 --> 3:27:36.400]  is to expose them
[3:27:36.400 --> 3:27:38.400]  and so is your job
[3:27:38.400 --> 3:27:40.400]  and anybody's job
[3:27:40.400 --> 3:27:42.400]  is to expose people
[3:27:42.400 --> 3:27:44.400]  who are doing this kind
[3:27:44.400 --> 3:27:46.400]  of you know
[3:27:46.400 --> 3:27:48.400]  soft censorship
[3:27:48.400 --> 3:27:50.400]  which is not going to remain soft
[3:27:50.400 --> 3:27:52.400]  because operations
[3:27:52.400 --> 3:27:54.400]  like news guard are also
[3:27:54.400 --> 3:27:56.400]  involved you see
[3:27:56.400 --> 3:27:58.400]  in selling their services
[3:27:58.400 --> 3:28:00.400]  to
[3:28:00.400 --> 3:28:02.400]  school systems
[3:28:02.400 --> 3:28:04.400]  libraries
[3:28:04.400 --> 3:28:06.400]  as far as I'm concerned
[3:28:06.400 --> 3:28:08.400]  their long range plan
[3:28:08.400 --> 3:28:10.400]  and it isn't that long range
[3:28:10.400 --> 3:28:12.400]  is to embed these kinds
[3:28:12.400 --> 3:28:14.400]  of apps
[3:28:14.400 --> 3:28:16.400]  in
[3:28:16.400 --> 3:28:18.400]  browsers and so forth
[3:28:18.400 --> 3:28:20.400]  and so on so that people won't
[3:28:20.400 --> 3:28:22.400]  even know
[3:28:22.400 --> 3:28:24.400]  that they're being massively cut off
[3:28:24.400 --> 3:28:26.400]  from information sources
[3:28:26.400 --> 3:28:28.400]  that actually speak
[3:28:28.400 --> 3:28:30.400]  the truth about certain things
[3:28:30.400 --> 3:28:32.400]  that are very highly competitive
[3:28:32.400 --> 3:28:34.400]  with
[3:28:34.400 --> 3:28:36.400]  mainstream news
[3:28:36.400 --> 3:28:38.400]  you happen to be watching or listening
[3:28:38.400 --> 3:28:40.400]  to one of those sites
[3:28:40.400 --> 3:28:42.400]  right now it's called infowars
[3:28:42.400 --> 3:28:44.400]  right
[3:28:44.400 --> 3:28:46.400]  so at one level
[3:28:46.400 --> 3:28:48.400]  they're just cutting out
[3:28:48.400 --> 3:28:50.400]  the competition they want to cut out
[3:28:50.400 --> 3:28:52.400]  the competition
[3:28:52.400 --> 3:28:54.400]  because they can't stand up
[3:28:54.400 --> 3:28:56.400]  to it
[3:28:56.400 --> 3:28:58.400]  because they're being outmaneuvered and they've been outmaneuvered
[3:28:58.400 --> 3:29:00.400]  for a long time now
[3:29:00.400 --> 3:29:02.400]  by people speaking
[3:29:02.400 --> 3:29:04.400]  the truth
[3:29:04.400 --> 3:29:06.400]  so they contacted me
[3:29:06.400 --> 3:29:08.400]  as if oh yeah I'm going to say oh sure
[3:29:08.400 --> 3:29:10.400]  I'd love to answer your questions
[3:29:10.400 --> 3:29:12.400]  and I hope that you won't
[3:29:12.400 --> 3:29:14.400]  put me on your bad
[3:29:14.400 --> 3:29:16.400]  list
[3:29:16.400 --> 3:29:18.400]  no
[3:29:20.400 --> 3:29:22.400]  my job and your job
[3:29:22.400 --> 3:29:24.400]  is not to reason
[3:29:24.400 --> 3:29:26.400]  with somebody who wants to be a
[3:29:26.400 --> 3:29:28.400]  bully
[3:29:28.400 --> 3:29:30.400]  it's to expose
[3:29:30.400 --> 3:29:32.400]  them for what they are
[3:29:34.400 --> 3:29:36.400]  they're doing
[3:29:36.400 --> 3:29:38.400]  the corporate version
[3:29:38.400 --> 3:29:40.400]  of eliminating the First Amendment
[3:29:40.400 --> 3:29:42.400]  okay
[3:29:42.400 --> 3:29:44.400]  there's a way around
[3:29:44.400 --> 3:29:46.400]  the government say well we can't eliminate First Amendment
[3:29:46.400 --> 3:29:48.400]  how can we do that
[3:29:48.400 --> 3:29:50.400]  I mean if we just boldly come out
[3:29:50.400 --> 3:29:52.400]  and say no First Amendment
[3:29:52.400 --> 3:29:54.400]  but we can
[3:29:54.400 --> 3:29:56.400]  cooperate with all kinds of groups
[3:29:56.400 --> 3:29:58.400]  and people that want to do that
[3:29:58.400 --> 3:30:00.400]  and you know
[3:30:00.400 --> 3:30:02.400]  that's a good thing yeah we want to do that
[3:30:02.400 --> 3:30:04.400]  because
[3:30:04.400 --> 3:30:06.400]  the truth is
[3:30:06.400 --> 3:30:08.400]  devastating
[3:30:08.400 --> 3:30:10.400]  when you learn about it
[3:30:10.400 --> 3:30:12.400]  when you learn about the co-truth
[3:30:12.400 --> 3:30:14.400]  the truth about the vaccine
[3:30:14.400 --> 3:30:16.400]  the truth about
[3:30:16.400 --> 3:30:18.400]  the test
[3:30:18.400 --> 3:30:20.400]  that's completely useless and deceptive
[3:30:20.400 --> 3:30:22.400]  and unreliable
[3:30:22.400 --> 3:30:24.400]  the way for example
[3:30:24.400 --> 3:30:26.400]  that hospitalizations
[3:30:26.400 --> 3:30:28.400]  could be ramped up in Texas
[3:30:28.400 --> 3:30:30.400]  by the use of the PCR test
[3:30:30.400 --> 3:30:32.400]  so that
[3:30:32.400 --> 3:30:34.400]  Governor Abbott
[3:30:34.400 --> 3:30:36.400]  would be forced to backtrack on any
[3:30:36.400 --> 3:30:38.400]  efforts that he might be doing
[3:30:38.400 --> 3:30:40.400]  stage
[3:30:40.400 --> 3:30:42.400]  the answer

[3:33:13.400 --> 3:33:15.400]  50% off all of it free shipping
[3:33:15.400 --> 3:33:17.400]  huge deals on gravity fed water filters
[3:33:17.400 --> 3:33:19.400]  amazing deals on all of our products
[3:33:19.400 --> 3:33:21.400]  I'll be frank with you stuff's so bad
[3:33:21.400 --> 3:33:23.400]  we have funds inside our coffers
[3:33:23.400 --> 3:33:25.400]  to keep operating if they shut our shopping carts down
[3:33:25.400 --> 3:33:27.400]  we're under a major globalist attack
[3:33:27.400 --> 3:33:29.400]  not because we're the enemy
[3:33:29.400 --> 3:33:31.400]  but because we're standing between you
[3:33:31.400 --> 3:33:33.400]  and the globalist
[3:33:33.400 --> 3:33:35.400]  the globalist want to bankrupt you
[3:33:35.400 --> 3:33:37.400]  they want to enslave you
[3:33:37.400 --> 3:33:39.400]  they want to depopulate you
[3:33:39.400 --> 3:33:41.400]  they want to force inoculate you
[3:33:41.400 --> 3:33:43.400]  fund info wars and we'll take action against them
[3:33:43.400 --> 3:33:45.400]  in the fight
[3:33:45.400 --> 3:33:47.400]  you know it's crazy to get to this point
[3:33:47.400 --> 3:33:49.400]  it's very bittersweet
[3:33:49.400 --> 3:33:51.400]  and now we have a lot of credibility
[3:33:51.400 --> 3:33:53.400]  but I don't care about that
[3:33:53.400 --> 3:33:55.400]  I care about beating the new world order
[3:33:55.400 --> 3:33:57.400]  and it's because we have so much credibility
[3:33:57.400 --> 3:33:59.400]  they can't allow us to stay on air much longer
[3:33:59.400 --> 3:34:01.400]  and I don't have time to tell you all the stuff
[3:34:01.400 --> 3:34:03.400]  they're doing to us for a lot of reasons
[3:34:03.400 --> 3:34:05.400]  I can't tell you what's going on
[3:34:05.400 --> 3:34:07.400]  but let's just say this
[3:34:07.400 --> 3:34:09.400]  we're going to see this through the end
[3:34:09.400 --> 3:34:11.400]  we're going to stay on air as long as we can
[3:34:11.400 --> 3:34:13.400]  so please pray for us and please buy the products
[3:34:13.400 --> 3:34:15.400]  and then forwardstore.com they're great products
[3:34:15.400 --> 3:34:17.400]  plus they fund the operation
[3:34:17.400 --> 3:34:19.400]  they're great products you can buy
[3:34:19.400 --> 3:34:21.400]  they're still great
[3:34:21.400 --> 3:34:23.400]  these are great products that fund freedom
[3:34:23.400 --> 3:34:25.400]  and fund justice
[3:34:25.400 --> 3:34:27.400]  when the whole world is waking up and looking for truth
[3:34:27.400 --> 3:34:29.400]  that's why the globalists are censoring
[3:34:29.400 --> 3:34:31.400]  they can't bring in all this tyranny
[3:34:31.400 --> 3:34:33.400]  and leave people like us on the air
[3:34:33.400 --> 3:34:35.400]  so while you're at it don't just financially support us
[3:34:35.400 --> 3:34:37.400]  and spread the word
[3:34:37.400 --> 3:34:39.400]  download everything we've done you can find and save it
[3:34:39.400 --> 3:34:41.400]  because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[3:34:41.400 --> 3:34:47.400]  we're just trying to destroy everything we ever said
[3:34:47.400 --> 3:34:49.400]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:35:05.400 --> 3:35:07.400]  okay last segment here
[3:35:07.400 --> 3:35:09.400]  John Rapport
[3:35:09.400 --> 3:35:11.400]  so
[3:35:11.400 --> 3:35:13.400]  on this issue of censorship
[3:35:13.400 --> 3:35:15.400]  there's one more thing that I want to point out
[3:35:17.400 --> 3:35:19.400]  the Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania
[3:35:19.400 --> 3:35:21.400]  John Fetterman
[3:35:21.400 --> 3:35:23.400]  I mean you would think
[3:35:23.400 --> 3:35:25.400]  under ordinary circumstances
[3:35:27.400 --> 3:35:29.400]  that somebody in a position like that
[3:35:29.400 --> 3:35:31.400]  would have any knowledge
[3:35:31.400 --> 3:35:33.400]  some knowledge of the Constitution
[3:35:33.400 --> 3:35:35.400]  I mean something that they learned
[3:35:35.400 --> 3:35:37.400]  in school that they vaguely remember
[3:35:37.400 --> 3:35:39.400]  that you know
[3:35:39.400 --> 3:35:41.400]  some level of IQ about this
[3:35:41.400 --> 3:35:43.400]  whatsoever
[3:35:43.400 --> 3:35:45.400]  and you would also think
[3:35:45.400 --> 3:35:47.400]  that the good citizens of the state of Pennsylvania
[3:35:47.400 --> 3:35:49.400]  would hold this guy's feet to the fire
[3:35:49.400 --> 3:35:51.400]  when he made statements like the following
[3:35:53.400 --> 3:35:55.400]  he basically said
[3:35:55.400 --> 3:35:57.400]  and this was after
[3:35:57.400 --> 3:35:59.400]  Biden was
[3:35:59.400 --> 3:36:01.400]  the winner or declared the winner and so forth
[3:36:01.400 --> 3:36:03.400]  that anybody making a statement
[3:36:03.400 --> 3:36:05.400]  about the stolen election
[3:36:05.400 --> 3:36:07.400]  in Pennsylvania
[3:36:07.400 --> 3:36:09.400]  that
[3:36:09.400 --> 3:36:11.400]  that would not be
[3:36:11.400 --> 3:36:13.400]  and was not protected
[3:36:13.400 --> 3:36:15.400]  speech under the Constitution
[3:36:15.400 --> 3:36:17.400]  can you believe
[3:36:17.400 --> 3:36:19.400]  this idiot
[3:36:19.400 --> 3:36:21.400]  and the thing is
[3:36:21.400 --> 3:36:23.400]  see he's not really an idiot
[3:36:23.400 --> 3:36:25.400]  he knows what he's doing
[3:36:25.400 --> 3:36:27.400]  as far as I'm concerned
[3:36:27.400 --> 3:36:29.400]  he says
[3:36:29.400 --> 3:36:31.400]  that if you say
[3:36:31.400 --> 3:36:33.400]  the election in Pennsylvania was stolen
[3:36:33.400 --> 3:36:35.400]  that is not protected
[3:36:35.400 --> 3:36:37.400]  under the First Amendment
[3:36:37.400 --> 3:36:39.400]  that is the equivalent as he said
[3:36:41.400 --> 3:36:43.400]  John Fetterman
[3:36:43.400 --> 3:36:45.400]  Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania
[3:36:45.400 --> 3:36:47.400]  that is the equivalent of shouting
[3:36:47.400 --> 3:36:49.400]  fire in a crowded theater
[3:36:51.400 --> 3:36:53.400]  wow
[3:36:53.400 --> 3:36:55.400]  wow
[3:36:55.400 --> 3:36:57.400]  if he's playing the role
[3:36:57.400 --> 3:36:59.400]  of a complete moron
[3:36:59.400 --> 3:37:01.400]  he's doing a tremendous
[3:37:01.400 --> 3:37:03.400]  job
[3:37:03.400 --> 3:37:05.400]  well done Lieutenant Governor
[3:37:05.400 --> 3:37:07.400]  you're looking like
[3:37:07.400 --> 3:37:09.400]  a moron of morons
[3:37:11.400 --> 3:37:13.400]  it's an attempt to censor people
[3:37:13.400 --> 3:37:15.400]  to bully people
[3:37:15.400 --> 3:37:17.400]  well we better not say the election is stolen
[3:37:17.400 --> 3:37:19.400]  because
[3:37:19.400 --> 3:37:21.400]  I mean if it's not protected under the Constitution
[3:37:21.400 --> 3:37:23.400]  then we could
[3:37:23.400 --> 3:37:25.400]  I don't know what could happen to us
[3:37:25.400 --> 3:37:27.400]  we could be
[3:37:27.400 --> 3:37:29.400]  lose our job prosecuted
[3:37:29.400 --> 3:37:31.400]  all kinds of thoughts go through
[3:37:31.400 --> 3:37:33.400]  people's minds no
[3:37:33.400 --> 3:37:35.400]  no it is protected
[3:37:35.400 --> 3:37:37.400]  it is protected
[3:37:37.400 --> 3:37:39.400]  under the Constitution
[3:37:39.400 --> 3:37:41.400]  right
[3:37:43.400 --> 3:37:45.400]  got these people coming out of the
[3:37:45.400 --> 3:37:47.400]  woodwork trying to censor
[3:37:47.400 --> 3:37:49.400]  everybody
[3:37:49.400 --> 3:37:51.400]  that they could possibly censor
[3:37:51.400 --> 3:37:53.400]  who might be talking
[3:37:53.400 --> 3:37:55.400]  even a shred
[3:37:55.400 --> 3:37:57.400]  of truth
[3:37:57.400 --> 3:37:59.400]  going on in the world
[3:38:01.400 --> 3:38:03.400]  so I want to take the rest of the time today
[3:38:03.400 --> 3:38:05.400]  in this segment to talk about
[3:38:05.400 --> 3:38:07.400]  what the globalists
[3:38:07.400 --> 3:38:09.400]  are really up to
[3:38:09.400 --> 3:38:11.400]  from a different angle
[3:38:11.400 --> 3:38:13.400]  technocrats, globalists
[3:38:13.400 --> 3:38:15.400]  how do they see things
[3:38:15.400 --> 3:38:17.400]  they see things as
[3:38:19.400 --> 3:38:21.400]  the need to be organized
[3:38:21.400 --> 3:38:23.400]  that's what they see
[3:38:23.400 --> 3:38:25.400]  when they look at the world
[3:38:25.400 --> 3:38:27.400]  it's this
[3:38:27.400 --> 3:38:29.400]  psychotic
[3:38:29.400 --> 3:38:31.400]  need
[3:38:31.400 --> 3:38:33.400]  and obsession
[3:38:33.400 --> 3:38:35.400]  to control yes
[3:38:35.400 --> 3:38:37.400]  but also to organize
[3:38:37.400 --> 3:38:39.400]  what is that person doing over there
[3:38:39.400 --> 3:38:41.400]  that we don't know about
[3:38:41.400 --> 3:38:43.400]  that has to be organized
[3:38:43.400 --> 3:38:45.400]  we have to pull that person in
[3:38:45.400 --> 3:38:47.400]  and get them to be part of the overall structure
[3:38:47.400 --> 3:38:49.400]  and what is this happening
[3:38:49.400 --> 3:38:51.400]  this event over here
[3:38:51.400 --> 3:38:53.400]  what are these people doing
[3:38:53.400 --> 3:38:55.400]  we have to know exactly
[3:38:55.400 --> 3:38:57.400]  what's going on so we have to use
[3:38:57.400 --> 3:38:59.400]  surveillance to know at all times
[3:38:59.400 --> 3:39:01.400]  what's going on everywhere
[3:39:01.400 --> 3:39:03.400]  so that we can organize all of it
[3:39:05.400 --> 3:39:07.400]  which means
[3:39:07.400 --> 3:39:09.400]  fitting everybody into
[3:39:09.400 --> 3:39:11.400]  slots so they belong in
[3:39:11.400 --> 3:39:13.400]  set places and they have
[3:39:13.400 --> 3:39:15.400]  designated functions
[3:39:15.400 --> 3:39:17.400]  and if that sounds
[3:39:17.400 --> 3:39:19.400]  like they're talking about a machine
[3:39:19.400 --> 3:39:21.400]  well they are
[3:39:21.400 --> 3:39:23.400]  they're talking about a machine
[3:39:23.400 --> 3:39:25.400]  made out of machines
[3:39:25.400 --> 3:39:27.400]  because they believe
[3:39:27.400 --> 3:39:29.400]  you're a machine
[3:39:29.400 --> 3:39:31.400]  and you're a machine and I'm a machine
[3:39:31.400 --> 3:39:33.400]  and every human is a machine
[3:39:33.400 --> 3:39:35.400]  that's what they see
[3:39:35.400 --> 3:39:37.400]  that's what they believe
[3:39:37.400 --> 3:39:39.400]  well it's a machine
[3:39:39.400 --> 3:39:41.400]  we don't understand all the parts yet
[3:39:41.400 --> 3:39:43.400]  we're just learning really
[3:39:43.400 --> 3:39:45.400]  about the genetics and so forth
[3:39:45.400 --> 3:39:47.400]  and how to manipulate and blah blah blah
[3:39:47.400 --> 3:39:49.400]  but it's all really a machine
[3:39:49.400 --> 3:39:51.400]  there's no consciousness
[3:39:51.400 --> 3:39:53.400]  there's no free will
[3:39:53.400 --> 3:39:55.400]  there's no soul
[3:39:55.400 --> 3:39:57.400]  there's no spirit
[3:39:57.400 --> 3:39:59.400]  there's no higher purpose
[3:39:59.400 --> 3:40:01.400]  there's no
[3:40:01.400 --> 3:40:03.400]  creative power
[3:40:03.400 --> 3:40:05.400]  freedom is just an illusion
[3:40:05.400 --> 3:40:07.400]  a machine doesn't have freedom
[3:40:11.400 --> 3:40:13.400]  that's what they see
[3:40:13.400 --> 3:40:15.400]  that's what they see
[3:40:15.400 --> 3:40:17.400]  when they look out at the world
[3:40:17.400 --> 3:40:19.400]  they see
[3:40:19.400 --> 3:40:21.400]  that
[3:40:21.400 --> 3:40:23.400]  and therefore
[3:40:23.400 --> 3:40:25.400]  they have the obsession to organize it
[3:40:27.400 --> 3:40:29.400]  that's what they're about doing
[3:40:29.400 --> 3:40:31.400]  that's what is behind
[3:40:31.400 --> 3:40:33.400]  what they're doing
[3:40:35.400 --> 3:40:37.400]  too many people to organize then we need less people
[3:40:39.400 --> 3:40:41.400]  too many people talking about freedom
[3:40:41.400 --> 3:40:43.400]  we gotta shut that down
[3:40:43.400 --> 3:40:45.400]  because after all that's just a delusion
[3:40:45.400 --> 3:40:47.400]  that there is this thing called freedom
[3:40:47.400 --> 3:40:49.400]  and
[3:40:49.400 --> 3:40:51.400]  it's a dangerous delusion because
[3:40:51.400 --> 3:40:53.400]  when people
[3:40:53.400 --> 3:40:55.400]  get this idea into their heads
[3:40:55.400 --> 3:40:57.400]  then they become unpredictable
[3:40:57.400 --> 3:40:59.400]  and we don't know what they're going to do
[3:40:59.400 --> 3:41:01.400]  so we have to stop them
[3:41:01.400 --> 3:41:03.400]  so we have to stamp out freedom
[3:41:03.400 --> 3:41:05.400]  stamp out not only
[3:41:05.400 --> 3:41:07.400]  freedom itself
[3:41:07.400 --> 3:41:09.400]  but the idea of freedom
[3:41:09.400 --> 3:41:11.400]  the delusion of everything
[3:41:11.400 --> 3:41:13.400]  so that it's erased
[3:41:13.400 --> 3:41:15.400]  from history
[3:41:15.400 --> 3:41:17.400]  just a way
[3:41:17.400 --> 3:41:19.400]  for those of you that have ever read
[3:41:19.400 --> 3:41:21.400]  Huxley's Brave New World
[3:41:21.400 --> 3:41:23.400]  see how that's done
[3:41:23.400 --> 3:41:25.400]  through the genetic control
[3:41:25.400 --> 3:41:27.400]  of all births
[3:41:27.400 --> 3:41:29.400]  through the conditioning
[3:41:29.400 --> 3:41:31.400]  from the moment of
[3:41:31.400 --> 3:41:33.400]  genetic inception
[3:41:33.400 --> 3:41:35.400]  all the way through birth and afterwards
[3:41:37.400 --> 3:41:39.400]  and the
[3:41:39.400 --> 3:41:41.400]  pretension
[3:41:41.400 --> 3:41:43.400]  that everybody is going to be happy
[3:41:43.400 --> 3:41:45.400]  in their designated functions
[3:41:45.400 --> 3:41:47.400]  because they've been
[3:41:47.400 --> 3:41:49.400]  conditioned to be happy
[3:41:51.400 --> 3:41:53.400]  see that's the primary delusion
[3:41:53.400 --> 3:41:55.400]  behind all of this technocracy
[3:41:57.400 --> 3:41:59.400]  they don't believe in real
[3:41:59.400 --> 3:42:01.400]  happiness and joy
[3:42:01.400 --> 3:42:03.400]  and ecstasy
[3:42:03.400 --> 3:42:05.400]  that a human
[3:42:05.400 --> 3:42:07.400]  can experience that takes them
[3:42:07.400 --> 3:42:09.400]  out into spiritual dimensions
[3:42:09.400 --> 3:42:11.400]  and all manner of
[3:42:11.400 --> 3:42:13.400]  unnameable
[3:42:13.400 --> 3:42:15.400]  fantastic
[3:42:15.400 --> 3:42:17.400]  realms
[3:42:19.400 --> 3:42:21.400]  so for them the basic idea
[3:42:21.400 --> 3:42:23.400]  of happiness is some shrunken
[3:42:23.400 --> 3:42:25.400]  version of
[3:42:25.400 --> 3:42:27.400]  pleasure
[3:42:27.400 --> 3:42:29.400]  pleasure versus pain
[3:42:29.400 --> 3:42:31.400]  okay we can provide a certain amount
[3:42:31.400 --> 3:42:33.400]  of pleasure to people by conditioning
[3:42:33.400 --> 3:42:35.400]  them from the moment
[3:42:35.400 --> 3:42:37.400]  of inception
[3:42:37.400 --> 3:42:39.400]  and that means they will be happy
[3:42:39.400 --> 3:42:41.400]  no it doesn't
[3:42:41.400 --> 3:42:43.400]  no it doesn't
[3:42:43.400 --> 3:42:45.400]  it means people would be reduced
[3:42:45.400 --> 3:42:47.400]  in their ability
[3:42:47.400 --> 3:42:49.400]  to experience
[3:42:49.400 --> 3:42:51.400]  themselves and other people
[3:42:51.400 --> 3:42:53.400]  and life
[3:42:53.400 --> 3:42:55.400]  if the conditioning works
[3:42:55.400 --> 3:42:57.400]  and then people would say
[3:42:57.400 --> 3:42:59.400]  well I guess what's left over
[3:42:59.400 --> 3:43:01.400]  is happiness and so
[3:43:01.400 --> 3:43:03.400]  I guess you could say I'm happy with
[3:43:03.400 --> 3:43:05.400]  the way things are
[3:43:05.400 --> 3:43:07.400]  but I've been assigned
[3:43:07.400 --> 3:43:09.400]  to be and do
[3:43:09.400 --> 3:43:11.400]  and how to behave
[3:43:11.400 --> 3:43:13.400]  and how to stay within the rules
[3:43:13.400 --> 3:43:15.400]  and never break the rules
[3:43:15.400 --> 3:43:17.400]  never go outside your assigned function
[3:43:17.400 --> 3:43:19.400]  you see this is what they're trying to do
[3:43:19.400 --> 3:43:21.400]  to convince you
[3:43:23.400 --> 3:43:25.400]  don't go outside your assigned function
[3:43:25.400 --> 3:43:27.400]  find out what that is
[3:43:27.400 --> 3:43:29.400]  that function and obey it
[3:43:29.400 --> 3:43:31.400]  and you're saying why are you crazy
[3:43:31.400 --> 3:43:33.400]  so speak up speak out
[3:43:33.400 --> 3:43:35.400]  resist rebel
[3:43:35.400 --> 3:43:37.400]  that's what this is all about
[3:43:37.400 --> 3:43:39.400]  on behalf of
[3:43:39.400 --> 3:43:41.400]  what freedom actually is
[3:43:43.400 --> 3:43:45.400]  the size of
[3:43:45.400 --> 3:43:47.400]  the scope of it the depth of it
[3:43:47.400 --> 3:43:49.400]  the potential of
[3:43:49.400 --> 3:43:51.400]  what it can
[3:43:51.400 --> 3:43:53.400]  lead to in terms
[3:43:53.400 --> 3:43:55.400]  of greater life
[3:43:55.400 --> 3:43:57.400]  not just for the group
[3:43:57.400 --> 3:44:03.400]  but for every individual
[3:44:03.400 --> 3:44:05.400]  the technocrats and globalists
[3:44:05.400 --> 3:44:07.400]  are obsessed with organization
[3:44:09.400 --> 3:44:11.400]  that's what they must have
[3:44:11.400 --> 3:44:13.400]  whereas the people
[3:44:13.400 --> 3:44:15.400]  who know they're free
[3:44:15.400 --> 3:44:17.400]  say
[3:44:17.400 --> 3:44:19.400]  you know
[3:44:19.400 --> 3:44:21.400]  certain amount of organization
[3:44:21.400 --> 3:44:23.400]  is certainly useful
[3:44:23.400 --> 3:44:25.400]  I mean you don't want to live in total chaos
[3:44:25.400 --> 3:44:27.400]  but
[3:44:27.400 --> 3:44:29.400]  it's nothing compared to the fundamental
[3:44:29.400 --> 3:44:31.400]  innards
[3:44:31.400 --> 3:44:33.400]  of freedom
[3:44:33.400 --> 3:44:35.400]  are you kidding
[3:44:35.400 --> 3:44:37.400]  that's the first thing
[3:44:37.400 --> 3:44:39.400]  that's prime A number one
[3:44:39.400 --> 3:44:41.400]  and if you're going to try to deny me
[3:44:41.400 --> 3:44:43.400]  that
[3:44:43.400 --> 3:44:45.400]  and censor me over that
[3:44:45.400 --> 3:44:47.400]  and claim some kind of crap
[3:44:47.400 --> 3:44:49.400]  about how I'm violating
[3:44:49.400 --> 3:44:51.400]  or the first amendment
[3:44:51.400 --> 3:44:53.400]  or not protected by the first amendment
[3:44:53.400 --> 3:44:55.400]  or whatever
[3:44:55.400 --> 3:44:57.400]  or I have to submit to your interview
[3:44:57.400 --> 3:44:59.400]  to decide whether I'm worthy
[3:44:59.400 --> 3:45:01.400]  or not
[3:45:01.400 --> 3:45:03.400]  are you kidding me
[3:45:03.400 --> 3:45:05.400]  I decide whether you're worthy
[3:45:05.400 --> 3:45:07.400]  or not
[3:45:07.400 --> 3:45:09.400]  you're on my blacklist
[3:45:09.400 --> 3:45:11.400]  I
[3:45:11.400 --> 3:45:13.400]  exile you
[3:45:13.400 --> 3:45:15.400]  because freedom
[3:45:15.400 --> 3:45:17.400]  comes before you
[3:45:17.400 --> 3:45:19.400]  who are trying to
[3:45:19.400 --> 3:45:21.400]  censor everything and everybody
[3:45:21.400 --> 3:45:23.400]  you're the ones
[3:45:23.400 --> 3:45:25.400]  who are doomed
[3:45:25.400 --> 3:45:27.400]  you're going into the dustbin
[3:45:27.400 --> 3:45:55.400]  you're going into the dustbin
