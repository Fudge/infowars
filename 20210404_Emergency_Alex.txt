[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.520]  The issue of pandemic preparedness, and if there's one message that I want to leave
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.200]  with you today based on my experience, and you'll see that in a moment,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.440]  is that there is no question that there will be a challenge to the coming administration in the
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.880]  arena of infectious diseases, both chronic infectious diseases in the sense of already
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.640]  ongoing disease, and we have certainly a large burden of that, but also there will be a surprise
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.480]  outbreak, and I hope by the end of my relatively short presentation you will understand why
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.800]  history of the history of the last 32 years that I've been the director of NIAID will tell
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.360]  the next administration that there's no doubt in anyone's mind
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.520]  that they will be faced with the challenges that their predecessors were faced with.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is an emergency transmission, Saturday, April 3, 2021. I am
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.840]  your host, Alex Jones. I want to thank the crew for coming in and doing a great job with us here.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.680]  I have two of our great investigative researchers, Rob Dew and Mike Halprin, here with me in studio,
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.040]  and we want to thank all the viewers and listeners that have tuned in to this information.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:45.280]  It could not be of any greater importance. It could not be more serious to every human life,
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.760]  but also the rest of life on this planet, the scientific dictatorship, the scientific tyranny,
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:59.040]  the complete revolution and takeover that we're witnessing. Now you just saw Fauci
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.200]  four years ago right after Trump got in office saying he will be challenged by a surprise
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.680]  outbreak. Wow, he knows about a surprise. And then out of the Wuhan lab that even Newsweek
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.200]  and Reuters report he basically controlled 11 programs on of gain of function viruses,
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:29.200]  chimera viruses in the Corona family, even listed and called COVID-21, COVID-25, COVID-2019.
[00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.230]  This individual then had John Hopkins that he basically runs with Bill Gates.
[00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.630]  We'll show you all the documents, develop war games two months after Trump got into
[00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.530]  office laying all of this out.
[00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.130]  So we're going to show you the documents.
[00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.730]  We're going to show you the quotes and then you're going to see in
[00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.530]  real time as they rolled it out.
[00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.830]  Now, most people that are informed have heard about event 201.
[00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.330]  They've heard about Operation Lockstep.
[00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.730]  They've heard about Crimson Contagion.
[00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.630]  They've heard about Disease X and the UN Drills.
[00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.430]  But have you heard about SPARS 2025-2028?
[00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.930]  It is all of those plans together, but not set in the near future like those
[00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.130]  previous drills were but set out a few more years in the future, but it's
[00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.530]  actually paralleling the time we're in now.
[00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:32.930]  So just superimpose 2025-2028 with 2020-2023.
[00:03:32.976 --> 00:03:38.676]  And it is exactly what's happening now.
[00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:39.876]  Here's what's devastating.
[00:03:41.076 --> 00:03:45.476]  We're about 13 months into the simulation that again is not really a
[00:03:45.476 --> 00:03:49.676]  simulation. They're using that to cover their operations in case they get
[00:03:49.676 --> 00:03:51.676]  caught with the documents. They just say it's part of the drill.
[00:03:51.676 --> 00:03:55.376]  That's a classic operation by intelligence agencies governments, but
[00:03:55.376 --> 00:03:56.476]  also health agencies.
[00:03:56.448 --> 00:04:03.608]  Next, they say that within six months to a year of people being inoculated with these
[00:04:03.608 --> 00:04:10.928]  experimental GMO gene therapies, that you will have massive brain damage and spongiform
[00:04:10.928 --> 00:04:15.528]  encephalopathy basically, or prion disease, mad cow disease.
[00:04:15.528 --> 00:04:22.648]  Now, it's not just them saying this, this is in 2017 they produced this document.
[00:04:22.648 --> 00:04:29.448]  Redditor Fauci says the surprise is coming soon, and they say in there it's going to
[00:04:29.448 --> 00:04:34.568]  cause encephalopathy in children and adults, you name it, and there's going to be a huge
[00:04:34.568 --> 00:04:40.408]  outcry and they're going to blame the politicians, not Big Pharma, for speeding it up.
[00:04:40.408 --> 00:04:44.128]  That Trump really stepped into it, he got set up big time, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:44.128 --> 00:04:46.648]  So I want to explain something.
[00:04:46.648 --> 00:04:52.228]  We could go for 10 hours straight just reading and not scratch the surface of this.
[00:04:52.228 --> 00:04:59.188]  We have read all of this together that you see, Mike Alpern, Rob Dew, the rest of the crew.
[00:04:59.188 --> 00:05:07.628]  And when you see it, I have been physically nauseous before we went on air today because
[00:05:07.628 --> 00:05:12.948]  this is the smoking gun and these mad scientist types.
[00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:18.779]  Literally think we're too stupid to figure this out and stop them and they're not even
[00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:19.779]  hiding what they're doing.
[00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:24.438]  And then I've got Ted Turner and Bill Gates and all the rest of them admitting and Klaus
[00:05:24.438 --> 00:05:25.438]  Schwab.
[00:05:25.438 --> 00:05:29.299]  Oh, this is really the lower the human population and cut carbon and we need climate lockdowns
[00:05:29.299 --> 00:05:30.299]  now.
[00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:31.299]  And this has been wonderful.
[00:05:31.299 --> 00:05:32.759]  And look, I've got headlines right here.
[00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:38.539]  The Times of London billionaire club in bid to curb overpopulation.
[00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:44.219]  And then it goes into how they're taking control of the world medical system through the UN
[00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.739]  to carry out this depopulation.
[00:05:46.739 --> 00:05:51.979]  This article is from more than 10 years ago.
[00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.419]  And I literally have hundreds of these.
[00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:01.519]  I just mentioned to use spongiform encephalopathy or prion disease, microbiology, infectious
[00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:07.239]  diseases journal, COVID-19 RNA based vaccines and the risk of prion disease that was put
[00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:12.039]  out in 2021 by prestigious scientists.
[00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.079]  Here's the deal.
[00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:22.979]  It's in the spars 2025 20 28 document that that's going to be the huge crisis that they'll
[00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:28.078]  then have the medical system take over and get more control and get a giant global bailout,
[00:06:28.078 --> 00:06:33.379]  a giant global Marshall fund Marshall plan for.
[00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:38.019]  So again, as I keep saying, the credit crisis has been they've got to have a bigger crisis
[00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:42.618]  to cover up the last crisis, like cover up all the vaccine problems, all the tainted
[00:06:42.618 --> 00:06:44.739]  vaccines, all the sicknesses, all the autism.
[00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:49.539]  The UN said in 2019 of the December emergency meeting, head of the UN vaccine program said
[00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:50.979]  these vaccines are killing people.
[00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:51.979]  They don't work.
[00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:52.979]  Doctors don't believe in them.
[00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:53.979]  Remember all that?
[00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:55.779]  We'll put the article on screen.
[00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:56.419]  Remember all that?
[00:06:56.401 --> 00:07:06.801]  And so now they have this big crisis it's even bigger vaccine damage and they admit that and then they get more control because the medical system then responds to that
[00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:10.081]  So so this is how you enslave people while you kill them
[00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:14.161]  We're going to lay every bit of it
[00:07:15.361 --> 00:07:19.601]  And how the rockefeller foundation is behind it bill gates is just their front along with fauci
[00:07:20.561 --> 00:07:24.721]  Here in just a moment. We also have cian and others saying no one should have freedom
[00:07:24.881 --> 00:07:29.041]  They need to keep us locked down until we submit the vaccines. They admit it's not about your safety
[00:07:29.201 --> 00:07:32.881]  It's about you submitting the vaccine which is connected not just to brain damage
[00:07:33.521 --> 00:07:35.521]  but also
[00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:43.701]  Infertility this is the smoking gun spars 2025 scenario 2028 from john hopkins
[00:07:43.924 --> 00:07:53.123]  so give us about a two minute summation before we get into how it's happening the end game where
[00:07:53.123 --> 00:07:58.084]  they're taking us the proof rob do and then we'll get mike helper and also give us his boil down
[00:07:58.084 --> 00:08:02.164]  summation because both you have good angles on this reading these documents over the last few
[00:08:02.164 --> 00:08:07.123]  weeks yourself and then we'll start drilling directly into the documents themselves and
[00:08:07.123 --> 00:08:13.683]  showing people the war game which isn't a war game it's a war plan on us the population
[00:08:13.683 --> 00:08:19.924]  their admission that's what it is and then in real time the drill being synced up with the dates
[00:08:19.924 --> 00:08:25.044]  and here's the problem next they admit massive brain damage massive cancer massive death if it
[00:08:25.044 --> 00:08:33.684]  continues to track um rob do yeah so the parallels on this are just from a when you looked at 9 11 and
[00:08:33.684 --> 00:08:38.644]  you saw the parallels that happened this has got the same thing in it with like massive power
[00:08:38.644 --> 00:08:44.644]  outages you've got a male and female president the president who's a male uh stops after a few
[00:08:44.644 --> 00:08:49.204]  years or it's the female who's she's only in for one term and then she leaves and then then the male
[00:08:49.204 --> 00:08:53.524]  president takes over we kind of have that going on there's so many parallels the disease sort of
[00:08:53.524 --> 00:08:58.243]  looks the same but it's a little longer now it's they've they've created a worse type of gain of
[00:08:58.243 --> 00:09:02.804]  function now it's got more gain of function it's um when you compare it to the to the covet
[00:09:03.764 --> 00:09:07.924]  but this is something we've been talking about for years medical tyranny it's something that
[00:09:07.924 --> 00:09:11.604]  i've been researching for years that's how they're going to take everything over through
[00:09:11.604 --> 00:09:16.564]  vaccines injections diet injections injunctions all that stuff that they've been writing about
[00:09:16.564 --> 00:09:21.524]  for years we've been trying to show it to people and now it's all sort of coming together this is
[00:09:21.524 --> 00:09:27.364]  the big event this is like lockstep is like the granddaddy this is sparse pandemic is the daddy
[00:09:27.364 --> 00:09:31.924]  and then you got the two kids crimson contagion and event 201 along with these other little
[00:09:31.924 --> 00:09:37.764]  exercises they do but this is the blueprint for how they're going to censor people but they don't
[00:09:37.764 --> 00:09:41.924]  say censorship they have another little cute word for it this is how they're going to cover up side
[00:09:41.924 --> 00:09:45.524]  effects how they're going to roll out side effects how they're going to talk about side effects how
[00:09:45.524 --> 00:09:49.604]  they're even going to talk about tuskegee when that comes out and we've seen all this stuff happen
[00:09:49.604 --> 00:09:57.204]  to us under the covet lockdown in real time so it's really um i mean this is what it is
[00:09:57.204 --> 00:10:01.444]  they call it a futuristic scenario it should be a futuristic script for public health risk
[00:10:01.444 --> 00:10:06.164]  communicators because this is a this is to give talking points to all the minions on what to say
[00:10:06.164 --> 00:10:10.243]  what file to pull out like you were mentioning dr strangelove when they pull out a file for a
[00:10:10.243 --> 00:10:14.723]  different scenario they got somebody talking about tuskegee they pull it out they give it to fauci
[00:10:14.723 --> 00:10:19.204]  fauci goes oh we have a black woman making this vaccine it's fine don't worry but why would a
[00:10:19.204 --> 00:10:24.164]  black woman hurt you with a vaccine so they have all these they're thinking about this stuff and
[00:10:24.164 --> 00:10:28.404]  they had black nurses up front when it first rolled out before blacks even questioned it they'd
[00:10:28.404 --> 00:10:33.124]  already done studies and knew it they already have yale before all this happened wargaming every
[00:10:33.124 --> 00:10:38.723]  scenario as well they don't deny their wargaming all this right that's it's all public how they're
[00:10:38.723 --> 00:10:42.483]  wargaming but it's going to get real as we get into this and we show the slides where the
[00:10:42.483 --> 00:10:47.044]  similarities are you're going to be freaked out and you should be you should be freaked out you
[00:10:47.044 --> 00:10:51.364]  should get awake you should get activated and you should start telling people about what's going on
[00:10:51.364 --> 00:10:55.204]  because a lot of people haven't heard as far as pandemic not a lot of people have heard about this
[00:10:55.204 --> 00:10:59.044]  this is one that it's it's there but you really have to be looking for it you have to go seek it
[00:10:59.044 --> 00:11:03.364]  out and we're going to put this all out we're going to put the link to it on on when we post
[00:11:03.364 --> 00:11:07.204]  this on info war so you could go read it for yourself here it is right here this is all it's
[00:11:07.204 --> 00:11:11.444]  70 something pages long right there all right rob great job going over all this getting all these
[00:11:11.444 --> 00:11:15.843]  slides that you prepared ready i want to talk to mike halpern a little bit get his take on this
[00:11:15.843 --> 00:11:22.004]  before we dive into it but here's really the most important part about all this they ran drills on
[00:11:22.004 --> 00:11:27.284]  9 11 of attacking the world trade centers with hijacked jets that's abc news doesn't mean there
[00:11:27.284 --> 00:11:30.723]  isn't radical islam doesn't mean they weren't working with the globalists but the point was to
[00:11:30.723 --> 00:11:36.243]  make sure there was a stand down they had drills so that when norad saw this they stood down with
[00:11:36.243 --> 00:11:40.564]  the jets and didn't shoot down the aircraft until the finally they disregarded orders and did shoot
[00:11:40.564 --> 00:11:44.804]  down flight 93 that was going towards the capital that was supposed to be destroyed and full martial
[00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:49.284]  law would have come in folks look this up it'll blow you away they even abc news reports on this
[00:11:49.284 --> 00:11:55.124]  cbs they had drills of the world trade centers attacked on the morning of 9 11 pre-planned for
[00:11:55.124 --> 00:11:59.604]  six months and ran the drills and so everybody stood down because they thought it was part of
[00:11:59.604 --> 00:12:08.164]  the drill that's impossible well it's the same thing here this is set in the year 2025 2028
[00:12:08.164 --> 00:12:14.723]  but it's really 2020 2023 and it's exactly what's happening at exactly the same time in exactly the
[00:12:14.723 --> 00:12:20.723]  same order and now just like sherry tin penny and other scientists the wolfgang wudarg have looked
[00:12:20.723 --> 00:12:27.364]  at the documents and they say oh my gosh uh they've they've looked at the vaccines the mRNA
[00:12:27.364 --> 00:12:34.243]  vaccines this is going to cause protein buildup in the brain basically spongiform encephalopathy
[00:12:34.243 --> 00:12:40.483]  mad cow this is going to cause infertility in the placenta and they look at the coating they know
[00:12:40.483 --> 00:12:46.084]  and now we get a document where they're saying three and a half four years ago oh this thing's
[00:12:46.084 --> 00:12:51.204]  coming and when it does we're going to vaccinate everybody but it's going to cause a bunch of brain
[00:12:51.204 --> 00:12:57.204]  damage you will have to have a secret fund that pays people off i mean wow so so again that's
[00:12:57.204 --> 00:13:02.963]  only one facet mike alpert spend a few minutes uh again giving us your general overview is before
[00:13:02.963 --> 00:13:07.044]  we dig in i mean it's a little bit disheartening just to be able to read what we're living right
[00:13:07.044 --> 00:13:12.884]  now the event 201 is basically a one-time deal the crimson contagion is a one-time deal this
[00:13:12.884 --> 00:13:18.644]  spars 2025 we're living in this every single day and it says word for word what's going to be
[00:13:18.644 --> 00:13:24.483]  happening in the near future so whether we want to reject it or accept it it's happening they say
[00:13:24.483 --> 00:13:29.044]  word for word what's going to happen to your children the health effects of all the different
[00:13:29.044 --> 00:13:33.444]  vaccines we're going to be going over that in a little bit the timeline exactly when they're
[00:13:33.444 --> 00:13:40.243]  able to roll out the vaccine when spars emerges now this exercise was put in the future which i
[00:13:40.243 --> 00:13:46.963]  think threw a lot of people off it showed okay maybe this isn't the uh pandemic but in my opinion
[00:13:46.963 --> 00:13:54.644]  this is it we are living inside of this alex well exactly again i'll explain if there's a drill
[00:13:54.644 --> 00:13:59.204]  during the real terror attack if the people involved the terror attack organizing it get caught
[00:13:59.204 --> 00:14:03.604]  they just go on part of a drill so they have to have a blueprint to carry out a total takeover
[00:14:03.604 --> 00:14:09.844]  of society they've got to have battle plans but you simply call the battle plans well let's say
[00:14:09.844 --> 00:14:13.284]  you're a serial killer you're writing about the women you kidnapped murdered and tortured well you
[00:14:13.284 --> 00:14:17.364]  just write about it in a horror novel that way if the cops ever catch you they go oh that's just my
[00:14:17.364 --> 00:14:22.564]  novel but they can go oh the old barn with an old church back in the woods where the women are
[00:14:22.564 --> 00:14:29.604]  buried they go back and dig it out the women are there it's not a novel it is a a a plan an
[00:14:29.604 --> 00:14:36.324]  operation that's now being carried out that is disguised as a scenario as a drill and when again
[00:14:36.324 --> 00:14:41.124]  we're going to go over the connections of this in a moment then if you take event 201 if you take
[00:14:41.124 --> 00:14:47.204]  crimson contagion if you would take uh the the big blueprint to launch the attack from 11 years ago
[00:14:47.204 --> 00:14:51.844]  operation lockstep for the rockefeller foundation then you see it's all the rockefeller foundation
[00:14:51.844 --> 00:14:57.364]  people we're going to show you that as well that are running all the other events and scenarios
[00:14:57.364 --> 00:15:02.723]  and then when you place all four of the drills together it's word for word real time what's
[00:15:02.804 --> 00:15:10.404]  happening when you move the dates from 2025 and 2028 to 2020 2023 so mike you've got more points
[00:15:10.404 --> 00:15:14.963]  to make then we'll start plowing into it yeah just the fact that they're really going after
[00:15:14.963 --> 00:15:18.804]  pregnant women they're going after children they're going after people with chronic health
[00:15:18.804 --> 00:15:23.364]  conditions they know that and it says it right here the fact that the majority of us citizens
[00:15:23.364 --> 00:15:27.763]  willing to be vaccinated had already been immunized the negative publicity surrounding
[00:15:27.763 --> 00:15:32.963]  adverse reactions had little effect on nationwide vaccination rates basically what that means is
[00:15:32.963 --> 00:15:40.164]  that once they get everybody then the effects come in out and they surge it so fast that they
[00:15:40.164 --> 00:15:45.124]  just kind of drowned out all the deaths all the illnesses 4 000 dead in europe almost 3 000 dead
[00:15:45.124 --> 00:15:50.243]  here from the vaccine that's the cdc zone numbers bill gates said it'll hurt or kill 700 000 so they
[00:15:50.243 --> 00:15:54.164]  really got us ready up front this time well and the way they do that is with the fact checking all
[00:15:54.164 --> 00:15:57.763]  the fact checking because if you type in any of this stuff like hank erin died from the covid
[00:15:57.763 --> 00:16:02.884]  vaccine oh no the fact checkers all said that didn't happen he was uh the medical examiner
[00:16:02.884 --> 00:16:06.084]  looked at him even though when you call the medical examiner the medical examiner says no
[00:16:06.084 --> 00:16:11.604]  we never looked at the body but they use that and so but by placing those fact checking organizations
[00:16:11.604 --> 00:16:16.564]  at the top of every search using google using you know any of the other major search engines
[00:16:16.564 --> 00:16:22.404]  then it quickly dispels it dampers that that effect that it would have that's right and and
[00:16:22.404 --> 00:16:28.164]  and what we're saying here is folks when you read the 70-something page document spars 2025
[00:16:28.164 --> 00:16:33.364]  2028 and the accompanying documents that connect to it it blows you away because they talk about
[00:16:33.364 --> 00:16:36.963]  how to counter us they talk about how they're going to have fact checkers they talk about how
[00:16:36.963 --> 00:16:40.564]  they're going to block real news they talk about how they're going to censor they talk about how
[00:16:40.564 --> 00:16:46.084]  they're going to cover up the deaths i mean it is it is hitler wrote mine comp and said what he was
[00:16:46.084 --> 00:16:51.204]  going to do and then he did it and and and you're sitting here reading this it just blows you away
[00:16:51.204 --> 00:16:55.284]  so since i mentioned the rockefeller foundation let's just start there as we go into the document
[00:16:56.404 --> 00:17:00.644]  dr nick bright joins the rockefeller foundation to lead pandemic prevention
[00:17:01.524 --> 00:17:07.364]  institute development well guess where he already was before that's right with fauci
[00:17:07.924 --> 00:17:14.563]  running the whole thing to begin with running operation crimson contagion which again was
[00:17:14.563 --> 00:17:20.724]  two years ago to prepare the same towns the same cities in china basically the same stories the
[00:17:20.724 --> 00:17:27.924]  same maps even the same computer generators same reporters same tweets it's incredible put out as
[00:17:27.924 --> 00:17:33.364]  a drill then later put out as exactly real and then now he's setting up vaccine global response
[00:17:33.364 --> 00:17:40.484]  to create global health policy for the rockefeller foundation and they use a lot of these vocabulary
[00:17:40.484 --> 00:17:45.043]  that i think the viewers and listeners really need to learn one is stakeholder how many times
[00:17:45.043 --> 00:17:49.124]  is claus schwab talking about we're all stakeholders the health stakeholders we all
[00:17:49.124 --> 00:17:54.083]  need to be in this circular economy they talk about that in the documents they're talking about
[00:17:54.083 --> 00:17:59.124]  people with respiratory conditions because if whatever they're spraying from the sky or whatever
[00:17:59.124 --> 00:18:04.324]  they're putting in the in the soil or the food and that all comes together with a vaccine then
[00:18:04.324 --> 00:18:08.083]  the effects really come binary weapon that's right alex number of folks who don't want a
[00:18:08.083 --> 00:18:11.204]  binary weapon is you already have half of it in you then you've got to get the other half
[00:18:12.964 --> 00:18:18.563]  wow this is this is this is so diabolical okay so let's start let's start getting into it
[00:18:19.204 --> 00:18:26.484]  right now let's go ahead and begin here here is the project team who is on it all these different
[00:18:26.484 --> 00:18:32.083]  top eugenicists top globalists from around the country john hopkins bloomberg school
[00:18:32.083 --> 00:18:37.924]  of public health here is the report that we're going to be quoting to you out of every single
[00:18:37.924 --> 00:18:44.244]  bit of this right now so here's here's the timeline and then here is the boil down that you
[00:18:44.244 --> 00:18:51.284]  did mike spars 2025 highlights let's just read these highlights and then oh we're not the fake
[00:18:51.284 --> 00:18:56.644]  news we're going to show you from the document the slides after we read the highlights but mike
[00:18:56.644 --> 00:19:01.764]  read us these highlights okay so first we're going to start talking about the neurological symptoms
[00:19:01.764 --> 00:19:06.324]  you you can't even believe that inside of spars it says that children are going to be getting
[00:19:06.324 --> 00:19:09.524]  neurological symptoms people are going to be getting neurological symptoms and we already
[00:19:09.524 --> 00:19:13.524]  six months to a year later six months to a year later and that's what uh which is a soft kill it's
[00:19:13.524 --> 00:19:18.004]  a delayed weapon that's what dr sherry tenpenny talked about before this document was even known
[00:19:18.004 --> 00:19:21.284]  yeah we and we just discovered this document i'm sure it's on the internet but now we're covering
[00:19:21.284 --> 00:19:26.884]  it now and uh this can be found inside of the spars document word for word after showing no
[00:19:26.884 --> 00:19:33.204]  adverse side effects for nearly a year vaccine recipients slowly began to experience symptoms
[00:19:33.204 --> 00:19:38.563]  as time passed and more people across the united states were vaccinated claims of adverse side
[00:19:38.563 --> 00:19:44.804]  effects began to emerge as the investigations grew in intensity several high-ranking officials
[00:19:44.804 --> 00:19:50.324]  at the cdc and fda were forced to step down and withdraw from government they're setting up the
[00:19:50.324 --> 00:19:55.364]  health officials and the politicians to take the fall for this don't forget the people who fund all
[00:19:55.364 --> 00:20:00.004]  this are not the health officials it's not falchi it's the guys behind the scenes it's gate and
[00:20:00.004 --> 00:20:04.804]  that's what the un head of vaccine program said a year and a half ago in in switzerland she said
[00:20:04.804 --> 00:20:09.124]  we're not allowed to test it it's given to us by big pharma and bill gates and it's hurting people
[00:20:09.124 --> 00:20:13.364]  she's on video and you talked about the board that's above it the ethics board that's above them
[00:20:13.364 --> 00:20:18.884]  above the hospitals above the doctors so this is a high level a highly sophisticated military
[00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:25.844]  operation near the end of 2027 which is two years after spars emerges reports of new neurological
[00:20:25.844 --> 00:20:30.644]  symptoms began to emerge that's two years later so this keeps compounding several parents claimed
[00:20:30.644 --> 00:20:35.204]  that their children were experiencing neurological symptoms that month a group of parents whose
[00:20:35.204 --> 00:20:41.204]  children developed mental retardation as a result of encephalitis in the wake of korovax vaccination
[00:20:41.204 --> 00:20:46.563]  sued the federal government demanding removal of the liability shield protecting the pharmaceutical
[00:20:46.563 --> 00:20:51.204]  companies responsible for developing and manufacturing korovax so let me stop you again
[00:20:51.204 --> 00:20:56.563]  overhead shot i give you 100 mainline articles i give you 50 studies literally that i've seen
[00:20:56.563 --> 00:21:01.524]  here's a top-line study worried that scientists looked at the vaccine what it does with proteins
[00:21:01.524 --> 00:21:05.684]  in the body saying it'll grow proteins in the brain and basically give you mad cow this is
[00:21:05.684 --> 00:21:10.004]  this year them looking at the vaccine saying the scientist there is in the document four years ago
[00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:15.844]  what put out by john hopkins and fauci i mean holy hell keep going so the most important part
[00:21:15.844 --> 00:21:19.684]  of that last paragraph is that the majority of people who've gotten the vaccination which is i
[00:21:19.684 --> 00:21:23.684]  think at least over 80 million americans have already gotten the vaccine oh yeah they're
[00:21:23.684 --> 00:21:27.444]  targeting america a bunch of countries aren't doing it they're pulling out france other places
[00:21:27.444 --> 00:21:32.083]  won't do it but oh we're the most vaccinated now they don't realize that they cannot sue
[00:21:32.644 --> 00:21:38.644]  they can't go after the vaccine maker then it says that they're going to realize that they got
[00:21:38.644 --> 00:21:42.964]  damaged and then they're going to go after the vaccine maker so expect maybe in the next couple
[00:21:42.964 --> 00:21:47.844]  months to a year people starting to wake up saying wait maybe my kid did get injured and who is
[00:21:47.844 --> 00:21:52.004]  responsible for this well and like we were saying with the binary weapon you get the vaccine and
[00:21:52.004 --> 00:21:56.164]  then when you get exposed to the actual virus your immune system kicks into overdrive and
[00:21:56.164 --> 00:22:00.083]  that's how you get the brain swelling the encephalopathy all that stuff and when you
[00:22:00.083 --> 00:22:05.364]  come in contact with a regular virus now you have it exactly and here's the thing in this whole thing
[00:22:05.364 --> 00:22:09.444]  this whole document they have their disclaimer and at the end they go the infectious pathogens
[00:22:09.444 --> 00:22:14.164]  medical countermeasures characters new media experts blah blah blah here are hereby described
[00:22:14.164 --> 00:22:19.124]  are entirely fictional they say it's entirely fictional but when we show you how it relates
[00:22:19.124 --> 00:22:23.444]  in the real world scenario you're gonna you're gonna be blown away four years after they put
[00:22:23.444 --> 00:22:29.844]  this out in a huge scientific battle plan report top scientists are saying word for word it's doing
[00:22:29.844 --> 00:22:34.004]  what they said it would do please continue the fact that the majority of u.s citizens willing
[00:22:34.004 --> 00:22:39.284]  to be vaccinated had already been immunized the negative publicity surrounding adverse reactions
[00:22:39.284 --> 00:22:46.404]  had little effect on nationwide vaccination rates as these cases emerged patients began
[00:22:46.404 --> 00:22:52.484]  filing for compensation under the prep act due to lingering uncertainties over possible links
[00:22:52.484 --> 00:22:57.924]  between vaccination and reported neurological symptoms their compensation requests were placed
[00:22:57.924 --> 00:23:03.524]  on indefinite hold pending further data analysis because you can't get data because they skipped
[00:23:03.524 --> 00:23:08.404]  the animal trials and just did mass random testing it hits you later so they'll be able to cover it
[00:23:08.404 --> 00:23:15.364]  up this cohort many of whom adamantly supported the korovax vaccine initially quickly took to
[00:23:15.364 --> 00:23:20.724]  social media to publicize their issues so they're warning all their stakeholders that they're going
[00:23:20.724 --> 00:23:25.524]  to go to social media first so that's why the censorship started in 2017 and that's why they
[00:23:25.524 --> 00:23:29.844]  say we've got to shut everybody down and exactly so in 2017 which lines up with the years they
[00:23:29.844 --> 00:23:34.404]  launch early they begin taking all the anti-vaxxers off and there's an article uh it was about
[00:23:34.404 --> 00:23:39.924]  facebook and it's like these 12 people and it's people like robert uh kennedy junior um sherry
[00:23:39.924 --> 00:23:44.083]  tim penny other people like that ty bollinger these are the 12 people that are putting out all
[00:23:44.083 --> 00:23:47.844]  the vaccine misinformation and let's go further rob unbelievable i'm going to show a whole stack
[00:23:47.844 --> 00:23:53.124]  of mainline news from two years ago where they go oh bill gates is taking over all the media control
[00:23:53.124 --> 00:23:58.083]  and big tech to censor anti-vaxxers ahead of time i'll show all yeah in a moment i mean i'm talking
[00:23:58.083 --> 00:24:02.884]  to wall street journal so so so again this is where you cannot complain about what happens to
[00:24:02.884 --> 00:24:07.444]  you medically on the internet before it happens gates does this comprende keep going and there's
[00:24:07.444 --> 00:24:12.404]  no coincidence that the facebook censorship of info wars happened in 2017 around that time they
[00:24:12.404 --> 00:24:16.884]  targeted very specific channels to know who's going to talk about the vaccination effects
[00:24:16.884 --> 00:24:21.924]  so they could they needed to be able to do that beforehand as the pandemic tapered off several
[00:24:21.924 --> 00:24:28.404]  influential politicians and agency representatives came under fire for sensationalizing the severity
[00:24:28.404 --> 00:24:32.964]  of the event for perceived political gain they're talking about cuomo they're talking about uh
[00:24:32.964 --> 00:24:40.404]  newsome a lot of them i got uh he got an award cuomo well he got an emmy he got an emmy yeah so
[00:24:40.404 --> 00:24:45.524]  he sensationalized it he's going to take the fall for this so they even pre-programmed years before
[00:24:45.524 --> 00:24:49.524]  it happens how they're going to burn certain people continue that's right to determine how
[00:24:49.524 --> 00:24:55.844]  to best distribute limited doses of korovax to members of priority groups across the country
[00:24:55.844 --> 00:25:01.844]  the u.s government resorted to new controversial tactics notably having health care providers
[00:25:01.844 --> 00:25:07.364]  access patients electronic health records to determine the number of individuals in high
[00:25:07.364 --> 00:25:12.644]  risk populations receiving care in particular areas now in the united states they can target
[00:25:12.644 --> 00:25:17.684]  with drugs on tv we see them all the time we're one of the only industrialized nations that can
[00:25:17.684 --> 00:25:22.724]  receive ads from these drug companies but they can't get a list of people who have cancer they
[00:25:22.724 --> 00:25:27.283]  can't get a list of people who have encephalitis they're saying they want to be able to do that
[00:25:27.283 --> 00:25:32.084]  to be able to target directly with the health records that's and that puts you into the ggping
[00:25:32.084 --> 00:25:37.764]  apple run qr code system they're already spying on all that big techs merge the big pharma but
[00:25:37.764 --> 00:25:42.244]  now they want to legally have all that and have full control the name of your safety track you
[00:25:42.244 --> 00:25:46.484]  in live time with an app on your phone as well which is all here that's right furthermore these
[00:25:46.484 --> 00:25:52.564]  cases arose from the initial cohort of vaccine recipients those in high risk populations including
[00:25:52.564 --> 00:25:57.844]  those with other underlying health conditions making it increasingly difficult to determine
[00:25:57.844 --> 00:26:02.964]  the extent to which these symptoms are associated with vaccination that's their big game plan out
[00:26:02.964 --> 00:26:08.564]  it's soft kill it does it down the road it's to be able to know for whoever received the vaccine
[00:26:08.564 --> 00:26:12.644]  or maybe your mom or your child received it and you can't put two and two together because you
[00:26:12.644 --> 00:26:17.204]  already have autism you already have alzheimer's all the marketing is if you have pre-existing
[00:26:17.204 --> 00:26:21.684]  conditions take the vaccine that's what we see every day on and then it accelerates and it
[00:26:21.684 --> 00:26:25.764]  kills you quicker continue so they're getting rid of the useful cedars like bill gates said kill
[00:26:25.764 --> 00:26:31.924]  granny uh it's they have dutch tv saying kill autistic children uh kill down syndrome children
[00:26:31.924 --> 00:26:36.964]  continue well if hold on one second if you read that article about uh uh hank erin that robert f
[00:26:36.964 --> 00:26:43.444]  kennedy wrote he says it's really hard to to correlate vaccine damage um to a dead person it's
[00:26:43.444 --> 00:26:48.244]  hard to see these signs it doesn't just pop right out actually saying oh look here's the the red spot
[00:26:48.244 --> 00:26:52.164]  that appears on the brain it's not like that so it's can you imagine two years later how are you
[00:26:52.164 --> 00:26:56.884]  going to figure that out it's going to be hard for these parents to even say or prove that their
[00:26:56.884 --> 00:27:00.644]  kid had that's right this issue and that's what bill gates said he said this will kill or hurt
[00:27:00.644 --> 00:27:05.124]  700 000 people but he said we got to have it really strong so some people get hurt up front
[00:27:05.124 --> 00:27:07.924]  because it's got to be so strong to kill you down the road that's going to be a little bit
[00:27:07.924 --> 00:27:10.884]  obvious up front you're going to you're going to go to the slides in a moment yeah keep going i
[00:27:10.884 --> 00:27:15.684]  mean this gets worse alex severe side effects including swollen legs severe joint pain and
[00:27:15.684 --> 00:27:21.604]  encephalitis potentially resulting in seizures seizure disorders or death occasionally occurred
[00:27:21.604 --> 00:27:26.324]  word for word from the document everything now happening in match we got to add all the b-roll
[00:27:26.324 --> 00:27:32.084]  to that that's okay in an effort to further reach certain population subgroups agency officials
[00:27:32.084 --> 00:27:37.043]  enlisted the help of well-known scientists celebrities and government officials to make short
[00:27:37.043 --> 00:27:42.164]  videos and zap clips which is a type of social media in the exercise and in a few cases give
[00:27:42.164 --> 00:27:46.964]  interviews to major media outlets we cover this every day alice we see it all the time keep going
[00:27:47.764 --> 00:27:53.124]  among those chosen were former president and in this exercise her name is jacqueline bennett
[00:27:53.124 --> 00:27:59.524]  bz a popular hip-hop star and paul farmer co-founder of partners in health and a
[00:27:59.524 --> 00:28:03.924]  renowned global health expert who's essentially like the bill gates yeah and that run dmc clip
[00:28:03.924 --> 00:28:08.244]  which we have yeah that's what they're talking about hiring these hip-hop people hiring the
[00:28:08.244 --> 00:28:13.124]  people that are celebrities that you already trust you already know them for the last 15 20 years
[00:28:13.124 --> 00:28:21.444]  now they're promoting the vaccine on tv aspr recommended to hhs secretary nagel that sam hsa
[00:28:21.444 --> 00:28:27.764]  collaborate with stakeholders and devise devise behavioral health guidance for the states tribes
[00:28:27.764 --> 00:28:32.964]  and territories on how to strengthen the public's coping skills provide support for grieving
[00:28:32.964 --> 00:28:38.084]  individuals encourage a forward direction and meet other spars recovery needs basically what they're
[00:28:38.084 --> 00:28:43.043]  doing is what's in california if you have a health condition that they can't tie something to
[00:28:43.124 --> 00:28:46.564]  now they send the behavioral health people to your house and that's what all these stimulus
[00:28:46.564 --> 00:28:49.844]  money and so they go we don't know why your brain damage or why you're having convulsions you're
[00:28:49.844 --> 00:28:56.644]  mentally ill we've got drugs for you we've got anti-psychotics we've got uh these different
[00:28:56.644 --> 00:29:03.124]  uh chemicals these antidepressants and let's show those articles because remember yale got hired
[00:29:03.124 --> 00:29:08.324]  to quote sell us on taking the vaccines and how to respond to the problems the vaccines are going
[00:29:08.324 --> 00:29:14.484]  to cause i mean they're on record doing all of this they're on record using psychology against
[00:29:14.484 --> 00:29:19.844]  the people these groups initially came from four primary sources they're talking about the people
[00:29:19.844 --> 00:29:24.484]  that reject the vaccine that don't want to get involved in this nightmare muslim groups across
[00:29:24.484 --> 00:29:29.764]  the country who oppose the vaccine on the basis that the original formulation was used to treat
[00:29:29.764 --> 00:29:35.684]  pigs african-americans who refuse vaccination based on governmental experimentation on
[00:29:35.684 --> 00:29:42.324]  african-american populations alternative medicine proponents and anti-vaccination activists they
[00:29:42.324 --> 00:29:46.644]  already know who's going to reject their plan and they have plans to be able to counter them
[00:29:46.644 --> 00:29:52.884]  in the document alex and now you see it all in lockstep today the exact stuff unfolding that
[00:29:52.884 --> 00:29:58.884]  well they put the document conspiracy theories also proliferated across social media suggesting
[00:29:58.884 --> 00:30:05.283]  that the virus had been purposefully created and introduced to the population by drug companies or
[00:30:05.283 --> 00:30:09.844]  that it had escaped from a government lab secretly testing bioweapons let me have that i'm going to
[00:30:09.844 --> 00:30:14.644]  read that for people again this is directly cdc is essentially a drug company too they own patents
[00:30:14.644 --> 00:30:19.844]  on oh oh i mean fauci fauci owns it so again these are all just quotes out of the document itself so
[00:30:19.844 --> 00:30:26.164]  they're easier to read conspiracy theories also proliferated across social media suggesting that
[00:30:26.164 --> 00:30:31.043]  the virus had been purposely created and introduced to the population by drug companies or that it
[00:30:31.043 --> 00:30:40.004]  escaped from a government lab secretly testing bioweapons this is in 2017 right after fauci says
[00:30:40.884 --> 00:30:44.964]  a virus will be released it's going to happen it's going to challenge trump it's going to
[00:30:44.964 --> 00:30:53.524]  be a surprise operation and you can put on screen for folks the article ladies and gentlemen out of
[00:30:53.524 --> 00:31:03.283]  newsweek fauci did controversial gain of function viral testing at the wuhan lab because they knew
[00:31:03.283 --> 00:31:09.124]  they moved this there from chapel hill in 2015 north carolina there were big scientific articles
[00:31:09.124 --> 00:31:13.364]  in the mainstream news that what they were doing was a bioweapon huge gain of function playing with
[00:31:13.364 --> 00:31:18.644]  cold viruses that they shouldn't be doing it and then they put out a document even knowing people
[00:31:18.644 --> 00:31:24.004]  would counter them knowing they cooked it up in wuhan and how to go after them absolutely insane
[00:31:24.004 --> 00:31:28.164]  quickly now because i need to get to the actual slides we've only we've only scratched the surface
[00:31:28.164 --> 00:31:32.244]  here look at all this is all documentation here folks we haven't gotten through one document yet
[00:31:32.244 --> 00:31:36.244]  read the rest of that is just the summary we're just trying to give you guys the overall basis
[00:31:36.244 --> 00:31:41.364]  of this all the little details this took me two weeks to read by the way the wording it weaves
[00:31:41.364 --> 00:31:46.404]  everything together so you're like what is going on is this is an exercise this is real i was just
[00:31:46.404 --> 00:31:50.324]  trying to do the best i can to extract everything so if you had five minutes you can just understand
[00:31:50.324 --> 00:31:56.404]  what's happening here you go on july 9th 2026 a week before korovax was released for distribution
[00:31:56.404 --> 00:32:02.724]  in the united states the power grid at the grand coulee dam in eastern washington state experienced
[00:32:02.724 --> 00:32:08.244]  a catastrophic failure while the event did not destroy any infrastructure or result in any debts
[00:32:08.244 --> 00:32:13.764]  it did cause widespread power outages in washington oregon idaho montana and british
[00:32:13.764 --> 00:32:18.244]  colombia though power was restored within a day of the initial outage blackouts continued
[00:32:18.244 --> 00:32:22.884]  plaguing these areas over the next three weeks now let's think about that why would they put
[00:32:22.884 --> 00:32:29.204]  that in a vaccine exercise because they're all behind all this they're showing off to their
[00:32:29.204 --> 00:32:37.604]  people keep going yeah the real the very real possibility of a future sparse pandemic necessity
[00:32:37.604 --> 00:32:42.804]  continued commitment to vaccination program so inside the exercise it says this is done after
[00:32:42.804 --> 00:32:47.444]  three years of the initial outbreak it says you're going to need vaccines forever future
[00:32:47.444 --> 00:32:52.644]  outbreaks will continue to emerge unless countries maintain widespread vaccination
[00:32:52.644 --> 00:32:56.084]  and so we're going to release something new on you if you don't submit we can trojan horse where we
[00:32:56.084 --> 00:33:00.804]  want into it and you're like yeah we see this on the news every day this is from four years ago
[00:33:00.804 --> 00:33:05.924]  with fauci and john hopkins and bill gates and bloomberg now happening okay let's start moving
[00:33:05.924 --> 00:33:11.924]  quick now great job all right rob do let's now move from those highlights to the actual screenshots
[00:33:12.004 --> 00:33:18.724]  of the document the sparse pandemic 2025 2028 which is actually real time starting 2020 uh
[00:33:18.724 --> 00:33:24.004]  right now let's let's go ahead and as you go i'll flip through this your overhead shot here please
[00:33:24.004 --> 00:33:29.043]  so if you go to the first slide uh this is this was done in october 2017 which we've covered
[00:33:29.043 --> 00:33:34.164]  it precedes event 201 and crimson contagion which are two exercises that are sort of the
[00:33:34.164 --> 00:33:39.204]  getting people uh organized and getting ready for this this was done by johns hopkins you go
[00:33:39.204 --> 00:33:44.484]  to the next one johns hopkins is also in charge of event 201 with the world economic forum and
[00:33:44.484 --> 00:33:50.404]  the bill and melinda gates foundation and that's all the main global issue genesis leaders we have
[00:33:50.404 --> 00:33:55.364]  claus schwab saying this is to stop carbon this is to depopulate this is to save the earth i'll show
[00:33:55.364 --> 00:33:59.844]  you all those articles mainstream news you'll have nothing you'll own nothing you'll love it
[00:33:59.844 --> 00:34:04.564]  and it's all the same group you all run through john hopkins that gives the order to the un the
[00:34:04.564 --> 00:34:10.804]  who the the nih all of it continue all right if we go to the next one the name
[00:34:10.804 --> 00:34:16.163]  sars covid 2 is the actual name of the covid virus well here in the exercise go one more page
[00:34:16.163 --> 00:34:19.924]  alex and so we see bill and melinda gates also being involved with johns hopkins doing this now
[00:34:19.924 --> 00:34:24.484]  let's go to the next slide and we look at the name so that of course they come with the name st paul
[00:34:24.484 --> 00:34:29.283]  acute respiratory syndrome which is what you do when you have a virus you say where it came from
[00:34:29.283 --> 00:34:35.684]  so spars cove which stands for coronavirus now we have our virus here that which originated from
[00:34:35.684 --> 00:34:42.004]  wuhan they call it sars covid 2 almost the same exact name how did they predict that well we know
[00:34:42.004 --> 00:34:46.564]  we've seen sars covid 2 listed in other documents they were finding it in the sewage
[00:34:46.564 --> 00:34:51.283]  a few years before in europe this outbreak yeah so this this thing's been already an imf world bank
[00:34:51.283 --> 00:34:56.804]  documents in 2018 2019 so they cooked it up at wuhan they give it the same damn name basically
[00:34:56.804 --> 00:35:01.684]  in their drill when fauci says a mystery disease is about to come out and challenge trump and then
[00:35:01.684 --> 00:35:06.243]  it's basically the same name look at that again that is incredible it is and so let's go to the
[00:35:06.243 --> 00:35:12.804]  next slide where we have the inflated fatality estimates okay cdc came out with this is with
[00:35:12.804 --> 00:35:20.644]  spars and they said oh we're looking at a 4.7 fatality rate who said 14 percent under 64 and
[00:35:20.644 --> 00:35:25.924]  then 50 over 64 this is going to be huge kill a lot of people let's take our time read over this
[00:35:25.924 --> 00:35:30.484]  again we just showed you they have the basically the same name of the virus when fauci says this
[00:35:30.484 --> 00:35:34.884]  thing's going to hurt trump but oh we're going to counter it didn't come from a secret lab we run
[00:35:34.884 --> 00:35:39.124]  when he ran the lab confirmed now they even admit they're going to inflate the death numbers
[00:35:39.124 --> 00:35:43.444]  basically what they said they said four percent would die from it and then and then they admit
[00:35:43.444 --> 00:35:47.203]  they're giving us fake numbers right here and then how to counter that later this is incredible
[00:35:47.203 --> 00:35:51.124]  exactly they go over the same scenario so the actual once the exercise is done they go oh it
[00:35:51.124 --> 00:35:55.924]  was only 0.06 death rate and then you look at what happened with covet they imperial college
[00:35:55.924 --> 00:36:00.724]  came out and said 2.2 million people are going to die in the us and 510 over half a million in the
[00:36:00.724 --> 00:36:05.364]  uk and the who said the fatality rate is going to be two percent worldwide okay but then you look
[00:36:05.364 --> 00:36:10.964]  at what actually happened what do we what are the actual numbers of covet 0 to 19.003 percent
[00:36:11.684 --> 00:36:19.283]  20 to 49.02 percent 50 to 69 we start finally getting into some death rates go to the next
[00:36:19.283 --> 00:36:28.564]  slide guys 0.5 half a percentage rate there it is 70 plus years 5.4 so you do see some deaths
[00:36:28.564 --> 00:36:32.324]  in the older 70s but that's when they were bringing people into the nursing homes they
[00:36:32.324 --> 00:36:36.404]  were trying to kill that was the folks who are already sick as possible and then they were
[00:36:36.404 --> 00:36:40.404]  giving those people ventilators so that but let's slow down there you see that they said
[00:36:41.124 --> 00:36:46.004]  in a report three years before this started that it'll only be six percent that really died but
[00:36:46.004 --> 00:36:51.364]  we'll inflate the numbers and then we have the new york times headline 94 of people died of
[00:36:51.364 --> 00:36:58.084]  something else only six percent died the exact number three years later in the new york times
[00:36:58.084 --> 00:37:05.044]  so let's make sure we add that right here because that is in freaking credible and it goes on and
[00:37:05.044 --> 00:37:11.044]  on because it's all bs numbers it's all made up it's all scripted who even knows let's explain
[00:37:11.044 --> 00:37:14.964]  they don't just have their fake number at the start they have another fake number
[00:37:14.964 --> 00:37:19.844]  later yeah to control this whole thing yep exactly and you can even find that on the cdc
[00:37:19.844 --> 00:37:23.764]  because they even write in there that six percent of these people only died from covid of all the
[00:37:23.764 --> 00:37:28.564]  deaths we've had only six percent actually died from just covid everybody else had comorbidities
[00:37:28.564 --> 00:37:33.524]  at least two i think it was 2.6 comorbidities was the average by the way rob let's just start
[00:37:33.524 --> 00:37:37.124]  completely over let's go back to the very beginning this is so powerful this is so
[00:37:37.124 --> 00:37:41.044]  incredible and it gets even worse folks look at all this we read all this we every bit of this
[00:37:41.044 --> 00:37:44.724]  is just as bad they're killing you they're admitting it's world government to get rid of
[00:37:44.724 --> 00:37:49.444]  your family them admitting you'll all be brain damaged dying soon i mean i mean imagine knowing
[00:37:49.444 --> 00:37:53.924]  this and then they're censoring us all so we can't warn people and google employees are going to get
[00:37:53.924 --> 00:37:58.163]  the shots themselves it'll be dead in two years i mean this is insane so start over here is their
[00:37:58.163 --> 00:38:03.604]  own document just read it rob dude all right we'll start again spars pandemic 2025 2028 as
[00:38:03.604 --> 00:38:08.564]  you say you can make it 2020 to 2023 because that's what's going on uh the event date this
[00:38:08.564 --> 00:38:13.444]  proceeded event 201 in cribs and contagion this is the daddy the spars is the daddy of what's
[00:38:13.444 --> 00:38:18.564]  going on now that's it right there let's go to the next one run by john hopkins the world health
[00:38:18.564 --> 00:38:24.004]  organization uh that's world economic forum that's called world economic forum and bill gates these
[00:38:24.004 --> 00:38:28.163]  are the people as schwab and gates who are running this thing with the scientist brain bugs in johns
[00:38:28.163 --> 00:38:33.044]  hopkins who've been planning this stuff for years it's crazy let's go to the next one you look at
[00:38:33.044 --> 00:38:41.924]  the similarity to the names spars covid and then we have sars covid 2 okay same almost same exact
[00:38:41.924 --> 00:38:47.044]  name and they wrote this three or four years before they added a number and they and they and
[00:38:47.044 --> 00:38:52.804]  they just added a p they had a feeling of the exactly it's it's really crazy then we have the
[00:38:52.804 --> 00:38:58.804]  inflated fatality estimates initially they write in the scenario cdc fatality rate almost five
[00:38:58.804 --> 00:39:04.084]  percent who fatality rate fourteen and a half percent and then the fatality rate of over 64 is
[00:39:04.084 --> 00:39:10.324]  50 oh but when we actually get to it and we look at the numbers it's only 0.06 not even half a
[00:39:10.324 --> 00:39:15.044]  percent i mean it's crazy that's 0.06 it's not even a full percentage point and then you look
[00:39:15.044 --> 00:39:20.243]  at the inflated uh and estimates from imperial college 2.2 million people were going to die
[00:39:20.243 --> 00:39:24.884]  510 that freaked everybody out and the who said it was going to be a two percent fatality rate
[00:39:24.884 --> 00:39:29.764]  oh well we come back and it's barely anybody dying from this unless you're over 70 and you
[00:39:29.764 --> 00:39:35.124]  have comorbidities and only six percent of people who died from this actually just died of covid 19
[00:39:35.684 --> 00:39:39.764]  six percent and three years later the new york times said only six percent actually died of it
[00:39:39.764 --> 00:39:47.764]  exactly continuing all right uh one more guys skip to the next one so spars emerges 2025
[00:39:47.764 --> 00:39:54.484]  and then january 2026 as october 2025 january 2026 the government contracts with sin bio to
[00:39:54.484 --> 00:40:00.243]  produce the spars vaccine so that's four months now here we have december 31st covid 19 is
[00:40:00.243 --> 00:40:06.004]  identified that's the date they give as identifying covid 19 april 2020 u.s government launches
[00:40:06.004 --> 00:40:12.163]  operation warp speed they're giving money to vaccine companies to create the vaccine and they
[00:40:12.163 --> 00:40:16.243]  don't call it warp speed here they call it a similar name but it's the exact same thing to
[00:40:16.243 --> 00:40:21.124]  speed it up exactly yeah they which means giving them unlimited power yeah pretty much and it's
[00:40:21.124 --> 00:40:24.884]  all underdone on this emergency authorization everything's emergency authorizations they can
[00:40:24.884 --> 00:40:29.364]  do pretty well it's approved by the fda it's tested no it's not it's not it's only approved
[00:40:29.364 --> 00:40:33.524]  for emergency authorization which means you don't have anything else that could work with this which
[00:40:33.524 --> 00:40:37.524]  is why they got rid of hydroxychloroquine ivermectin here we go anyway let's go to the
[00:40:37.524 --> 00:40:43.203]  antivirals is the next slide in this scenario they write they have one called callous severe
[00:40:44.004 --> 00:40:48.804]  all right ends in an ir side effects nausea headaches vomiting and body aches there's
[00:40:48.804 --> 00:40:53.364]  actually a viral video of a boy in this scenario taking the callous severe and then immediately
[00:40:53.364 --> 00:40:57.524]  projectile vomiting everywhere yeah they even have videos of their scenario it's and then
[00:40:57.524 --> 00:41:03.124]  and they go back to it then three years later it's rim desert here look and this is not the real
[00:41:03.124 --> 00:41:08.243]  name this is the name they gave it later it's actually got a different name that they that it's
[00:41:08.243 --> 00:41:11.924]  that i remember they said rim desert beer was this new experimental thing they just developed
[00:41:11.924 --> 00:41:16.324]  exactly they had the damn name three years before side same side effects nausea constipation
[00:41:17.283 --> 00:41:23.844]  it's all about rubbing in their faces it is they really do this is smoking gun okay keep going
[00:41:23.844 --> 00:41:27.764]  all right after antivirals we have the massive powder out power outage that michael was talking
[00:41:27.764 --> 00:41:32.243]  about earlier 10 months into the pandemic right as they're starting the vaccine rollout the pacific
[00:41:32.243 --> 00:41:39.444]  northwest has a two-week blackout okay go to the next slide guys there you go covet 19 13 months
[00:41:39.444 --> 00:41:44.804]  into the pandemic and two months into the vaccine rollout texas has a one week some spots it was a
[00:41:44.804 --> 00:41:51.924]  two-week blackout texas is about the same size if you throw it up there as uh washington oregon
[00:41:51.924 --> 00:41:57.844]  montana idaho you stick texas up there it's about the same size so i've learned i've learned their
[00:41:57.844 --> 00:42:04.163]  tricks obama said for three years as the head of the harvard law review that he was born in kenya
[00:42:04.163 --> 00:42:09.444]  so we would say he was born in kenya not hawaii to the famous porn director communist uh frank
[00:42:09.444 --> 00:42:14.244]  marshall davis so they do that to rub it in further okay obviously that was a whole so that
[00:42:14.244 --> 00:42:19.204]  was so we focus on that they'll only focus on that later not that they had the rendezavir name
[00:42:19.204 --> 00:42:23.124]  drug the same and all the other stuff exactly the same right that's their little side i mean i've
[00:42:23.124 --> 00:42:26.564]  learned how they work oh yeah yeah they even do that kind of stuff they're juicy as you like to
[00:42:26.564 --> 00:42:30.484]  say it's they're a little juicy to go hi look what we did we were able to cause this now let's look
[00:42:30.484 --> 00:42:35.204]  at the vaccine propaganda tech uh campaign that they're going to roll out so with spars they go
[00:42:35.204 --> 00:42:39.764]  with big tech celebrities the president which they they talk about the president coming out
[00:42:39.764 --> 00:42:46.324]  giving uh statements a hip-hop star named bz uh mainstream media and a global health expert who
[00:42:46.324 --> 00:42:50.404]  were a kennington bill gates as you mentioned earlier now look at coven 19 we had the four
[00:42:50.404 --> 00:42:54.884]  presidents come out talk about getting the vaccine we got john legend we've got run dmc
[00:42:54.884 --> 00:42:58.324]  we've got bill gates we've got ryan reynolds and we're going to show you all these tweets in a
[00:42:58.324 --> 00:43:04.404]  second dr fauci uh msm and the surgeon general the surgeon general is using the same hashtags
[00:43:04.404 --> 00:43:08.964]  as that are written in this scenario that's to get that's going to freak you out in a second
[00:43:08.964 --> 00:43:12.324]  jones we're going to show that exact hashtags we're going to show that that's why i'm telling
[00:43:12.324 --> 00:43:16.404]  you you're doing a great job i'm frustrated because we literally have only got into two
[00:43:16.404 --> 00:43:21.284]  documents there's over 20 documents left over 100 news articles we go to the next one now this is
[00:43:21.284 --> 00:43:24.644]  where the censorship takes place medical countermeasures that's what they call it they
[00:43:24.644 --> 00:43:29.284]  don't call it censorship they call it mcm so you're going to see that acronym all throughout
[00:43:29.284 --> 00:43:34.004]  this document mcm mcm it's like how do we how do we deal with this scenario somebody mentions
[00:43:34.564 --> 00:43:40.484]  how do we combat it somebody says oh i don't like how the muslim thing with with the pigs
[00:43:40.484 --> 00:43:44.884]  have it being associated with pigs oh so they built all these scenarios in so they have the
[00:43:44.884 --> 00:43:50.404]  folders and the and the suggestions in here written for the people to then say oh well
[00:43:50.404 --> 00:43:54.964]  don't worry about that we're not using pigs pigs weren't used in this version oh this has we have
[00:43:54.964 --> 00:43:59.044]  a black lady working on the vaccine and they doing that nice soft voice that gets everybody
[00:43:59.284 --> 00:44:03.604]  and let's just pause for a moment and get mike halpern's comment on this and yours as well rob
[00:44:04.244 --> 00:44:10.724]  because this is very upsetting this is all important but them calling it sars versus
[00:44:11.364 --> 00:44:16.884]  the other name that's just two letters change them uh having the drug be the same name that
[00:44:16.884 --> 00:44:21.364]  they claim was a brand new drug that just came out yeah all of that and then as you said the
[00:44:21.364 --> 00:44:26.084]  tweets where they put it all out as a drill and they use the same hashtags later show it's a
[00:44:26.084 --> 00:44:32.163]  blueprint and a battle plan i mean this is mind-blowing it really is disgusting now let's
[00:44:32.163 --> 00:44:36.163]  go to so the medical countermeasures there's if you read this there's several sections and
[00:44:36.163 --> 00:44:40.724]  appendices that are voted just to deal with the public pushback the changing of the guidelines
[00:44:40.724 --> 00:44:45.284]  where we had 14 days to stop this yeah you may have heard of this before 14 days to stop the
[00:44:45.284 --> 00:44:51.364]  spread exactly and so and then the viral video mask then yes mask yes you won't you like wonder
[00:44:51.364 --> 00:44:56.244]  where do they come up with all this they they even change their minds and do all this to make
[00:44:56.244 --> 00:45:02.084]  it look real yeah it's it's yeah we got new information new information's come to light
[00:45:02.084 --> 00:45:06.324]  as the dude one it's like you said we're all living this yeah no we are and as you see it
[00:45:06.324 --> 00:45:09.604]  as you start reading this you're like oh my god this is happening now oh my god this happened
[00:45:09.604 --> 00:45:13.924]  last week oh my god this was last year as you read this document it's in the same order it's
[00:45:13.924 --> 00:45:19.124]  in the same order it's crazy it's crazy so if you're supposed to be puppets living through
[00:45:19.124 --> 00:45:24.163]  their little shakespearean death play yes suave says we're merging our physical art oh yeah it's
[00:45:24.163 --> 00:45:29.364]  all merging together and this is part of it and so that's what it is is they've created a giant
[00:45:29.364 --> 00:45:33.604]  play that's reality and then we're all supposed to conform or we get censored and blacklisted
[00:45:33.604 --> 00:45:38.004]  but if we play along with it and become robots then we live you're either in their virtual
[00:45:38.004 --> 00:45:42.884]  reality or you're censored it's a sim city yeah definitely definitely and what have they done
[00:45:42.884 --> 00:45:46.964]  they bring on doctors they they censor doctors that are talking about this they have massive
[00:45:46.964 --> 00:45:51.044]  deplatforming which we've already seen it's happening now even today just just the fact
[00:45:51.044 --> 00:45:54.964]  that they were taking doctors off talking about this medical doctors who are working
[00:45:54.964 --> 00:45:59.364]  practicing medicine they take off their videos and how many of those videos do we put on band
[00:45:59.364 --> 00:46:03.444]  up video we probably don't even have half of what has been taken off because they just keep
[00:46:03.444 --> 00:46:09.044]  removing removing and again it's all premeditated let's continue well let's just finish with this
[00:46:09.044 --> 00:46:13.524]  here uh using fact check organizations to debunk things this is a medical countermeasure that's
[00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:18.084]  going on that's run by bill gates run by big pharma that's why you see when you type in
[00:46:18.084 --> 00:46:22.564]  something about somebody dying from the vaccine there's 15 fact check articles before you get to
[00:46:22.564 --> 00:46:26.964]  anything that's even a news article and it's because they've already war game this out back
[00:46:26.964 --> 00:46:31.684]  in 2017 they know what they're going to do so bill gates had the fact check orgs step up facebook
[00:46:31.684 --> 00:46:37.444]  hires them twitter looks at them no no no it's worse than that wuhan runs the covet 19 fact
[00:46:37.444 --> 00:46:41.444]  checking yes they create what you're supposed to go that's a face a former facebook the woman
[00:46:42.084 --> 00:46:48.404]  the former facebook employee works in the covet 19 area dr daniel anderson yeah yeah you can't make
[00:46:48.404 --> 00:46:53.284]  it up and then of course you got cnn and msnbc and all these places pushing the vaccine pushing
[00:46:53.284 --> 00:46:58.004]  the narrative and then you have on top of that inside these things big pharma is making these
[00:46:58.004 --> 00:47:02.163]  ads that aren't really ads but they're at like pfizer is the biggest spender of all these people
[00:47:02.163 --> 00:47:05.844]  if you look at what pfizer is doing they're just going they're making these things going look and
[00:47:05.844 --> 00:47:14.324]  so big pharma fact checkers then debunk you yeah big pharma ads government narrative debunk anything
[00:47:14.324 --> 00:47:18.084]  against government narrative continue yeah and then and then you have the native ads which are
[00:47:18.084 --> 00:47:21.764]  put out by the vaccine companies saying the vaccine is safe and effective and that's all
[00:47:21.764 --> 00:47:27.844]  they do vitamin mineral fusion is a remarkable product and it's back in stock 40 off at info

[00:48:24.324 --> 00:48:30.964]  attack with everybody for a moment yes they over blew covid yes they hyped it up yes they cooked it
[00:48:30.964 --> 00:48:36.884]  up in a lab but it's so they can own it is synthetic they can roll out new versions this
[00:48:36.884 --> 00:48:42.564]  isn't like a chevy you know gets better with time or whatever it gets worse with time you see brazil
[00:48:42.564 --> 00:48:48.644]  what they're being hit with clearly bill gates has said oh this is just a drill he said that
[00:48:48.644 --> 00:48:52.644]  on national tv last year terrorists are going to release the bio weapons to be really bad
[00:48:52.644 --> 00:48:57.124]  and now all these insider globalists that are in these white papers all over the news saying oh
[00:48:57.124 --> 00:49:02.724]  a really bad version or other stuff's coming for sure just like fauci said so this has all just been
[00:49:02.724 --> 00:49:07.524]  a drill to get us ready and i believe they're going to launch other bio attacks to cover all
[00:49:07.524 --> 00:49:11.124]  the sickness and illness that the vaccines themselves are going to cause that's even
[00:49:11.124 --> 00:49:14.964]  what mpr admits would top scientists i could believe was on there we already had scientists
[00:49:14.964 --> 00:49:22.324]  on the same thing a year ago this mrna goes in but also these virus vector vaccines astrazeneca
[00:49:22.404 --> 00:49:29.604]  and jj johnson johnson they go in and create real strains of dangerous viruses with what they do so
[00:49:30.084 --> 00:49:36.564]  uh this this is over the top yeah the cdc director calls it impending doom if we don't stay closed so
[00:49:36.564 --> 00:49:41.284]  it's an economic weapon it vertically integrates the economy it bankrupts little people it gives
[00:49:41.284 --> 00:49:46.404]  the central systems control much of the world's under martial law but finally once you struggle
[00:49:46.404 --> 00:49:50.804]  out of it they go oh really you didn't like one tenth of one percent dying here's something that
[00:49:50.804 --> 00:49:55.844]  does kill five percent and i'm predicting that's coming next uh so uh you want to talk about that
[00:49:55.844 --> 00:50:04.644]  mike halpern and then we'll get uh rob dues take on this i mean basically what i'm saying and just
[00:50:04.644 --> 00:50:09.604]  a general uh general picture alex is that right now they're just making money their industry was
[00:50:09.604 --> 00:50:14.244]  dying and a lot of people were waking up getting inside of these facebook groups talking to each
[00:50:14.244 --> 00:50:19.044]  other hey i think my kid got autism from this vaccine let's not let's not take that vaccine
[00:50:19.044 --> 00:50:22.964]  that vax documentary came out with the big tree a lot of people were waking up to the fact that
[00:50:22.964 --> 00:50:27.204]  these vaccines are really hurting people and people were talking to each other and we had the
[00:50:27.204 --> 00:50:33.284]  un uh december 2019 when you show those articles uh saying that yeah people were really talking
[00:50:33.284 --> 00:50:38.084]  to each other and saying maybe it's best that i don't get my kid vaccinated maybe i should homeschool
[00:50:38.084 --> 00:50:42.163]  maybe we should take a step in a different direction in regards to vaccines that's not
[00:50:42.163 --> 00:50:47.844]  an option for a trillion dollar vaccine business and because they're losing so much money they had
[00:50:47.844 --> 00:50:53.204]  to launch something alex they had to get something going that everyone would just comply and even
[00:50:53.204 --> 00:50:57.284]  when you're a child and your mother brings you into the doctor to get a vaccine they're scared
[00:50:57.284 --> 00:51:04.724]  they're scared of getting hiv or getting uh one of these diseases that they have for these vaccines
[00:51:04.724 --> 00:51:11.524]  and so this is the perfect excuse for everyone to just comply and the next step i mean these people
[00:51:11.524 --> 00:51:15.924]  are pure evil alex and if they're going to be launching some kind of bio weapon based on the
[00:51:15.924 --> 00:51:19.684]  document i wouldn't hesitate to think that well and you think about all the different vaccines
[00:51:19.684 --> 00:51:24.484]  they're injecting into people and then they're gonna those are the variants they're going to
[00:51:24.484 --> 00:51:27.764]  create more when they come in contact with the disease they're going to create something new
[00:51:27.764 --> 00:51:31.364]  in there and then that gets moved and then because these things do mutate they mutate all the time
[00:51:31.364 --> 00:51:36.163]  which is why you don't have a flu vaccine you don't have a cold vaccine they the flu vaccines
[00:51:36.163 --> 00:51:40.964]  never work it's because these things are always mutating so it changes over time so by injecting
[00:51:40.964 --> 00:51:45.284]  this one virus vector into you and then you come in contact with the disease you're going to create
[00:51:45.364 --> 00:51:51.044]  something different and there's no proving that this won't happen and when this does happen they've
[00:51:51.044 --> 00:51:55.844]  already got a plan for it so there we have basically six month timeline from right about now
[00:51:55.844 --> 00:52:00.884]  they've been what since december they've been given uh given vaccines but really the last month
[00:52:00.884 --> 00:52:05.204]  or so they've really amped up how many vaccines they're giving people so you're going to see
[00:52:05.844 --> 00:52:10.004]  six months from now six months maybe five months from now four months from now four to six months
[00:52:10.004 --> 00:52:15.044]  from now you're going to see people having really bad side effects they're starting to test this
[00:52:15.044 --> 00:52:19.924]  thing on children and uh and pregnant ladies we saw the pregnant lady who got who got one and she
[00:52:19.924 --> 00:52:26.324]  had a miscarriage but she was all for it she said it's for for uh our our health and and so then
[00:52:26.324 --> 00:52:29.444]  you're going to see the side effects in children happen because now they're that's two years down
[00:52:29.444 --> 00:52:33.924]  the road well they're probably not going to start injecting children till the end of this year and
[00:52:33.924 --> 00:52:38.163]  parents will bring their kids to do this it's crazy i can't believe what they're doing and
[00:52:38.163 --> 00:52:43.764]  how people are going along with it they really have created the psyop mixed in with the lockdown
[00:52:43.764 --> 00:52:48.804]  so you have people inside their homes looking at tv constantly they're given being fed the messages
[00:52:48.804 --> 00:52:53.284]  and they go just let me out let me out and i'll do whatever you want okay i'll take a vaccine good i
[00:52:53.284 --> 00:52:57.764]  can travel great they're just they just want to be left alone and since you mentioned that let's go
[00:52:57.764 --> 00:53:03.604]  ahead and play this clip this is cnn medical analyst says it's easier to get people vaccinated
[00:53:03.604 --> 00:53:09.524]  when they don't have their freedom she says let's keep the lockdown going until they all submit and
[00:53:09.524 --> 00:53:14.884]  take the vaccines but i think that there are many more people millions of people who for whatever
[00:53:14.884 --> 00:53:20.004]  reason have concerns about the vaccine who just don't know what's in it for them and we need to
[00:53:20.004 --> 00:53:25.444]  make it clear to them that the vaccine is the ticket back to pre-pandemic life and the window
[00:53:25.444 --> 00:53:29.364]  to do that is really narrowing i mean you were mentioning chris about how all these states are
[00:53:29.364 --> 00:53:35.524]  reopening they're reopening at a hundred percent and we have a very narrow window to tie reopening
[00:53:35.524 --> 00:53:40.884]  policy to vaccination status because otherwise if everything is reopened then what's the carrot
[00:53:40.884 --> 00:53:45.444]  going to be how are we going to incentivize people to actually get the vaccine so that's why i think
[00:53:45.444 --> 00:53:50.964]  the cdc and the bond administration needs to come out a lot bolder and say if you're vaccinated you
[00:53:50.964 --> 00:53:56.244]  can do all these things here are all these freedoms that you have because otherwise people are going
[00:53:56.244 --> 00:54:01.444]  to go out and enjoy these freedoms anyway and i fear a situation of coming into the fall where
[00:54:01.444 --> 00:54:08.084]  we never reach herd immunity and then we get hit by the next surge of of of covid 19 in the fall
[00:54:08.084 --> 00:54:13.124]  something that we could have prevented if we just got people vaccinated now and we are back ladies
[00:54:13.124 --> 00:54:19.604]  and gentlemen you just saw cnn analysts saying we're basically prisoners under a medical tyranny
[00:54:19.604 --> 00:54:23.684]  that has liability protection that they admit you take this you're not even protected from these
[00:54:23.684 --> 00:54:28.084]  covid variants because you can't be protected from the common cold it's the perfect takeover
[00:54:28.084 --> 00:54:33.764]  first it was five shots a year and then 10 shots a year then about 15 shots a year and and liability
[00:54:33.764 --> 00:54:40.324]  protection but let's put on screen from january of last year we're talking 13 14 months ago
[00:54:41.924 --> 00:54:47.844]  the un had a summit you can watch the videos there in the article from banned out video these
[00:54:47.844 --> 00:54:53.204]  are banned on youtube and twitter you try to show the un had a vaccine saying they don't protect you
[00:54:53.204 --> 00:54:59.044]  they're killing a bunch of people and that's banned and that's the control that we're talking
[00:54:59.044 --> 00:55:03.444]  about that we're going to get to in a moment uh so rob i i interrupted you because you brought up the
[00:55:03.444 --> 00:55:07.364]  fact that they're like we're going to hold you prisoners can't get on a plane can't have a job
[00:55:07.364 --> 00:55:13.444]  gg ping with the un uh admits that they're going to be running uh the entire program now uh for
[00:55:13.444 --> 00:55:17.764]  the world id i mean this is a freaking nightmare well and that was the momentum that was being built
[00:55:17.764 --> 00:55:23.684]  by citizen journalists and activists who were showing this showing the studies showing the
[00:55:23.684 --> 00:55:29.284]  ant antidotes of people having vaccine damage we were building all that and studies were starting
[00:55:29.284 --> 00:55:33.204]  to come out proving yeah and we had people like robert f kennedy who were writing article after
[00:55:33.204 --> 00:55:38.404]  article after article about this we almost had a presidential um symposium a thought group where
[00:55:38.404 --> 00:55:42.324]  they were going to get together and look at vaccine damage and all that stuff got pushed
[00:55:42.324 --> 00:55:47.684]  away pushed and by the way you pointed out that behind the scenes trump to his credit was actually
[00:55:47.684 --> 00:55:51.844]  killing their globalist programs before they launched those part of the crimson contagion
[00:55:51.844 --> 00:55:57.924]  exercise was that trump was defunding a lot of these different programs at the cdc we have an
[00:55:57.924 --> 00:56:03.204]  article about that he pulled us out of the who trump whether you like trump or you don't like
[00:56:03.204 --> 00:56:08.004]  trump trump just does his own thing and they don't like that they want to have full control even in
[00:56:08.004 --> 00:56:12.964]  the background the deep state all these controllers in the background they want to run everything and
[00:56:12.964 --> 00:56:17.524]  so maybe trump did come out about the vaccine but in general trump was defunding a lot of these
[00:56:17.524 --> 00:56:21.764]  programs alex and i just want to finish one thing on this the side effects that we have now that
[00:56:21.764 --> 00:56:26.644]  are being reported that's the next oh this is the final slide everything because we're talking about
[00:56:26.644 --> 00:56:31.124]  the final slide please the sparse side effects area they said but look we have 50 000 adverse
[00:56:31.204 --> 00:56:38.564]  events that have been reported to bears 2 200 deaths 7 700 serious injuries now there have
[00:56:38.564 --> 00:56:43.284]  been studies done they think only one percent of these adverse reactions are being of a hundred
[00:56:43.284 --> 00:56:46.884]  of a hundred yeah only one percent we're only getting one what they say is this between 10
[00:56:46.884 --> 00:56:51.124]  and 100 depending on the culture of the group the time the drug exactly but but it's between
[00:56:51.124 --> 00:56:57.604]  10 is the low 100 is the high so we're talking 50 times probably yeah more deaths well europe
[00:56:57.604 --> 00:57:02.163]  admits 4 000 deaths from the vaccine right so we're and that's in that's in europe this is just
[00:57:02.163 --> 00:57:06.964]  about the way they listen folks here's the good news we're not in a vacuum all these states are
[00:57:06.964 --> 00:57:11.284]  fighting back all these courts are fighting back you're fighting back india two months ago banned
[00:57:11.284 --> 00:57:17.684]  the pfizer mrna vaccine south africa over a hundred countries 25 in europe have banned the
[00:57:17.684 --> 00:57:23.284]  astrazeneca and then they but then oh oh the media is like no one's banned it they even have fact
[00:57:23.284 --> 00:57:28.804]  checks jones is wrong india didn't ban pfizer so they have these fact checkers that are lying frauds
[00:57:28.804 --> 00:57:32.484]  and they all work for facebook they're all interconnected these bill gates is heavily
[00:57:32.484 --> 00:57:38.084]  invested in facebook he's heavily invested in a lot of these different industries and if you just
[00:57:38.084 --> 00:57:42.564]  look at them one by one you can't put the pieces together but if you step back and see all of his
[00:57:42.564 --> 00:57:49.364]  investments you're gonna see they all tie into one huge global monopoly i want to show folks
[00:57:49.364 --> 00:57:53.924]  some background knowledge and we're we're all humans we're all people that care about freedom
[00:57:53.924 --> 00:57:58.644]  i get upset rob gets upset as we spend weeks studying this we finally get on air and it's just
[00:57:58.644 --> 00:58:03.844]  it's so upsetting we've covered 10 of what's in front of us every bit of this is just as insane
[00:58:03.844 --> 00:58:07.444]  or more insane i haven't even gotten to the part where they admit they're doing this to kill you
[00:58:07.444 --> 00:58:12.084]  and get and save the earth i mean they admit they're doing this claus schwab all of them but
[00:58:12.084 --> 00:58:17.684]  both of you spend a few minutes just in summation of of the bombshells that have been released here
[00:58:17.684 --> 00:58:23.924]  i mean to me the strongest thing is the drug name's the same before a drug even exists the
[00:58:23.924 --> 00:58:30.163]  virus name the same before they release it them running the lab i mean this is smoking gun one in
[00:58:30.163 --> 00:58:37.204]  85 trillion quadrillion i mean this this is premeditated total proof by the drills they did
[00:58:37.204 --> 00:58:40.804]  which they're using as the model for the takeover i just wish there was just some court that could
[00:58:40.804 --> 00:58:45.524]  take this up it looks like they're just admitting all these crimes and they happen exactly like they
[00:58:45.524 --> 00:58:50.404]  write about word for word if anyone just picks this up and runs with it i mean this is smoking
[00:58:50.404 --> 00:58:56.724]  gun evidence alex and and here's why i'm so upset i i know a bunch of people that have gotten super
[00:58:56.724 --> 00:59:02.163]  sick or that have died from the vaccine i know people now that are so freaked out that i warned
[00:59:02.804 --> 00:59:08.324]  that they're basically in catatonic shock because hey warn your family and then people i know their
[00:59:08.324 --> 00:59:13.444]  family took it and they're dead and and they're like i can't talk to you uh it wasn't the vaccine
[00:59:13.444 --> 00:59:18.163]  i go what your your father died or your your sister died yeah they're dead but don't lecture
[00:59:18.163 --> 00:59:24.644]  me i'm like what they take the vaccine click yeah so it's so big folks it's so huge and i'm
[00:59:24.644 --> 00:59:32.084]  explaining it's in this the document right here that they say it's gonna happen it's all in here
[00:59:32.084 --> 00:59:36.484]  i mean that's what i'm telling you can go ahead that's what's crazy is the big story here isn't
[00:59:36.484 --> 00:59:40.564]  they planned all this and released it and the money and the the power grab and the force
[00:59:40.564 --> 00:59:45.124]  inoculation and the global tracking system but they didn't just give us sugar water they're
[00:59:45.124 --> 00:59:50.644]  freaking killed they're depopulating people with horrible degenerative diseases that'll hold them
[00:59:50.644 --> 00:59:55.844]  down so now the whole family's wealth will go to take care of mom or the son of the daughter or dad
[00:59:56.644 --> 01:00:01.604]  so it's a soft kill weapon that sucks you dry and you're constantly paying them it's the drugs it's
[01:00:01.604 --> 01:00:06.804]  it's oral drugs it's vaccines it's the new thing that bill bill gates has to release out it's
[01:00:06.804 --> 01:00:11.204]  constant medical intervention that only they can supply these new medicines
[01:00:11.410 --> 01:00:18.850]  to you. Well, I tell you what. I think one thing I'd like to look at and show everybody
[01:00:18.850 --> 01:00:23.250]  are these tweets that they write. Oh, my God, this is an area more bombshell than anything
[01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:27.930]  else that we've even covered, which to me is just it's insane. Guys, pull up that we're
[01:00:27.930 --> 01:00:31.950]  going to do the CDC tweets first. You should have a list right there. I've got well, here's
[01:00:31.950 --> 01:00:37.029]  my copy. Here we go. Yeah. So we'll do this. The ones with CDC first. So CDC says holiday
[01:00:37.069 --> 01:00:41.830]  travel plans stop spars by washing your hands and avoiding public places. Okay. Then you
[01:00:41.830 --> 01:00:46.549]  go to the CDC actual tweet that they put out February 23rd talks about washing your hands
[01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:50.549]  take simple data. They have a picture of the person washing their hands. Coronavirus disease
[01:00:50.549 --> 01:00:53.870]  2019. And they're showing it right there. And that's when they were changing it from
[01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:57.950]  Wuhan flu to COVID-19. They're trying to get everybody on that say instead of saying
[01:00:57.950 --> 01:01:02.210]  Coronavirus, because when you look up Coronavirus, you go, Oh, it's a common cold. This isn't
[01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:08.129]  that bad. But there's one. The next one. If you feel ill, seek medical attention. Use
[01:01:08.129 --> 01:01:12.569]  the vampire cough. You know what the vampire cough is? Go to the next one, guys. That's
[01:01:12.569 --> 01:01:17.129]  when you put your your cough in your elbow like a vampire. So you're coughing into your
[01:01:17.129 --> 01:01:22.149]  elbow here. The CDC puts out another tweet, cover your cough, wash your hands, stay home
[01:01:22.149 --> 01:01:27.129]  when sick. All this is the same thing. So they basically using the same language. It's
[01:01:27.129 --> 01:01:31.129]  going to get crazy here in a second. Practice good hygiene during Thanksgiving travels, bring
[01:01:31.129 --> 01:01:36.210]  home leftovers not spars. Today's World Hygiene Day. They use the same, you know, hygiene.
[01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:40.009]  Thankful for the brave healthcare providers on the front line. Clean your hands, wash
[01:01:40.009 --> 01:01:45.690]  your hands, do all this stuff. Now the point is the simulation is reality. They're testing
[01:01:45.690 --> 01:01:50.049]  it, preparing it, getting their people ready. Happy Thanksgiving. Be safe on Black Friday.
[01:01:50.049 --> 01:01:55.089]  Have a, you know, basically virtual cyber Monday instead. And then CDC recommends virtual
[01:01:55.089 --> 01:02:00.430]  Thanksgiving to lessen the risk of COVID-19. This is done years before it actually happens.
[01:02:00.430 --> 01:02:04.870]  It is. And it's just insane. I want to go to this last one here and we could go through
[01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:10.629]  all these, but there's comparing, we're comparing a rapper, BZ, this fictional rapper. And I'm
[01:02:10.629 --> 01:02:17.549]  looking for Jerome Adams. BZ puts out a tweet that says vaccines work in the year 2026.
[01:02:17.549 --> 01:02:23.230]  Vaccines work. Hashtag Jerome Adams uses to all vaccines work advocates. He uses the same
[01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:28.670]  exact hashtag. So they thought of this hashtag before and they have the class severe. The,
[01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:33.350]  this is the red Desiree version of the drug, but here's the fake rapper pushing it. And
[01:02:33.350 --> 01:02:38.270]  now we have Jerome Adams, the former surgeon general pushing the exact same thing. Vaccines
[01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:40.069]  work hashtag vaccines work.
[01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:45.270]  Now here's the thing guys. They consulted with Ogilvy, which is an advertising agency
[01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:50.350]  for this exercise. It says on their website, on the center for health security.org that
[01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:56.910]  they are working with Ogilvy's guidelines for rolling out marketing campaigns. So this
[01:02:56.950 --> 01:03:01.910]  is a huge marketing advertising campaign. It's just that everybody has bought into it.
[01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:07.149]  They think it's real. It's actually just marketing. It is. It's all, it's all marketing. Let's
[01:03:07.149 --> 01:03:10.790]  go. And then it makes you sick for the rest of your life. And they admit that the top
[01:03:10.790 --> 01:03:14.870]  scientists have looked at these mRNA vaccines, especially they turn off your body's natural
[01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:18.910]  defenses. So you'll always will need something new for everything. Now you'll be like the
[01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:23.109]  boy in the bubble. Yeah. It's, it's pretty sick. Now we have BZ, this fictional rapper.
[01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:26.870]  Now we have run DMC. Who's come out with their animation to get the vaccine roll up
[01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:31.310]  your sleeve. Get it. There it is. I got the vaccine. You got the vaccine. They got the
[01:03:31.310 --> 01:03:36.470]  vaccine. I mean, it's crazy. Uh, that's that was promoted. The run DMC thing was promoted
[01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:41.750]  by everybody under the sun. We have John legend getting his vaccine. Walgreens taps, John
[01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:47.390]  legend to encourage vaccinations. And then here's BZ saying, look, you know, we had Tuskegee,
[01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:50.910]  but you know, I'm just proud of how everybody's coming together to do all this. So they're
[01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:56.509]  even working the Tuskegee angle into this because they've war gamed a black celebrity
[01:03:56.509 --> 01:03:59.509]  like Wendy Williams, who came out and said, I'm not getting the vaccine. I don't trust
[01:03:59.509 --> 01:04:03.950]  it. She didn't say Tuskegee, but we know that's what she's thinking because everybody else
[01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:07.350]  that's black, that's looking at this and not doing it. They're thinking, and that's the
[01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:12.629]  tip of the iceberg and expanding on that. You have to understand folks. It's the same
[01:04:12.629 --> 01:04:16.830]  names years before of the operations. All right. I want to show people these documents
[01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:22.549]  now. This is from the times of London. This is from the wall street journal. It's from
[01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:28.069]  the London guardian. This is all from 12 years ago. Okay. Overhead shot, please. Billionaire
[01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:36.589]  club in bid to curb over population. What do they say? Bill Gates with Ted Turner and
[01:04:36.589 --> 01:04:40.910]  with David Rockefeller and Oprah Winfrey and others, Warren Buffett are meeting to take
[01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:49.509]  over the UN to carry out Obamacare globally. So when Obama was first elected, they called
[01:04:49.509 --> 01:04:54.109]  the good club and they want to save the world by depopulating the planet. London guardian,
[01:04:54.109 --> 01:05:03.270]  Obama had just been elected 2009, right there. Hey, take your vaccine. Obama's black billionaires
[01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:09.270]  try to save the world. It's all right there. Global Obamacare, the good club billionaires.
[01:05:09.290 --> 01:05:18.970]  Coronavirus UK lockdown and it goes on. Oh, a big drop in air pollution says Klaus Schwab.
[01:05:18.970 --> 01:05:24.090]  We're saving the earth. It was good to lock things down. We need global lockdowns, reducing
[01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:29.370]  co2 and atmosphere would require COVID like lockdowns for decades. Yeah, they want to
[01:05:29.370 --> 01:05:31.930]  do it every two years. They're like every two years, we're going to have a lockdown
[01:05:31.930 --> 01:05:35.250]  or coronavirus lockdown emissions dropped drastically, but it's having little impact
[01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:44.130]  change. Sky News. So why did I just show you that? They admit this is not about
[01:05:45.330 --> 01:05:48.930]  saving you. It's about killing you. Bill Gates says he wants to populate you
[01:05:48.930 --> 01:05:52.529]  in videos online, but he wants you to take a shot because he cares about you. Here's
[01:05:52.529 --> 01:05:58.690]  the news wars article. Don't believe news wars. Go right here and see the videos that
[01:05:58.690 --> 01:06:02.770]  we got off the UN website. This happened in December. It took us a month for listeners
[01:06:02.770 --> 01:06:08.050]  to point it out to us. We didn't know about it. Listeners pointed out to us about this
[01:06:08.050 --> 01:06:13.570]  new drill that's so key or this new drill we just discovered. Top UN scientists admits
[01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:18.770]  vaccines killing people during vaccine safety summit. Go watch the video. I set up a whole
[01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:25.170]  video site to get around censorship just so you see it and then it gets a lot worse. Bias
[01:06:25.170 --> 01:06:31.250]  Facebook fact checkers once worked at Wuhan lab. You talked about that. That's the level
[01:06:31.810 --> 01:06:38.529]  of the incredible control. And so now I want to run through more of the documents with you
[01:06:38.529 --> 01:06:42.529]  overhead shot. Please make of this what you will. There's only a small
[01:06:43.730 --> 01:06:47.730]  smattering. This is just breadcrumbs. I'm showing you what's happening. I'm saying,
[01:06:47.730 --> 01:06:51.410]  here's the UN vaccine director saying they don't work or killing you. And the frontline
[01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:54.930]  daughters think it's bad right before they launched this attack to distract everybody.
[01:06:54.930 --> 01:06:58.770]  Here's CNN saying, we want you to live under tyranny, hold you hostage. So you take whatever
[01:06:58.770 --> 01:07:06.210]  shots we want. I already showed you her say that Nickelodeon announces Fauci COVID-19 news breaks
[01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:10.290]  where he brainwashes them and says, demand to your parents. You get these shots. You're going to die.
[01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:15.650]  Good news. Five States who've had enough of their governor's emergency powers. Big article
[01:07:15.650 --> 01:07:23.490]  daily wire. Oh, we've got now petitions to ban us off Amazon. Americans vaccination cards may only
[01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:29.970]  be the record of immunity. So keep them safe. If you want to travel COVID in the age of censorship,
[01:07:29.970 --> 01:07:36.930]  wall street journal from December of last year, admitting that it was a total takeover by big tech
[01:07:36.930 --> 01:07:43.009]  of even mainline scientists, mainline universities saying what they're doing is wrong with COVID-19.
[01:07:43.009 --> 01:07:48.050]  The vaccine won't work because it's a common cold, but they manmade it. So Gates owns it.
[01:07:49.009 --> 01:07:51.890]  COVID is accelerating a global censorship crisis wired
[01:07:53.490 --> 01:07:59.570]  they have big tech has hearings in Congress last week and they go, we're not censoring anybody.
[01:08:00.130 --> 01:08:07.090]  It's all publicly admitted right here. How Bill Gates premeditated COVID vaccine injury censorship.
[01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:13.450]  Before it even got bad, before they even killed us, what you were saying, Mike, he
[01:08:13.450 --> 01:08:18.130]  got it all set up to set up the groups that censor you and your family getting hurt. What
[01:08:18.130 --> 01:08:22.530]  a damn monster. It's like somebody putting a gag in your mouth before they kill you.
[01:08:22.530 --> 01:08:29.890]  The censorship of COVID-19 data around the world, fee.org, censorship kills the shunning
[01:08:29.890 --> 01:08:33.610]  of a COVID therapeutic. Won't let you know about natural things that protect you. This
[01:08:33.610 --> 01:08:37.490]  is all around giant depopulation evil.
[01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:43.890]  These therapeutics with, with, uh, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin. The reason they had to fight those
[01:08:43.890 --> 01:08:48.130]  is because if they had an actual treatment for this disease, they couldn't have their
[01:08:48.130 --> 01:08:53.490]  warp speed. They couldn't, they had to say, explain that. They had to say there's nothing
[01:08:53.490 --> 01:08:57.350]  that helps. So you get emergency authorization. If there's a whole bunch of stuff that helps
[01:08:57.350 --> 01:09:02.670]  like an orange or like zinc or like vitamin D, you know, then they couldn't have this
[01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:05.870]  emergency authorization. So the emergency authorization is what allows them to push
[01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:09.510]  these vaccines down your throat. It's what allows them to say, Oh, the FDA approved it
[01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:15.590]  for emergency authorization. You idiot. It's not for regular use. And when they decide
[01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:19.790]  to stop that emergency authorization, you're going to see all the vaccines dry up because
[01:09:19.790 --> 01:09:23.150]  they haven't been approved by the FDA because there haven't been any studies. That's the
[01:09:23.150 --> 01:09:26.750]  big thing. They haven't done the studies. They're doing them now as they're injecting
[01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:31.190]  it into you. And remember, as this Berlin wall of evil descends on all of us, you are
[01:09:31.190 --> 01:09:34.830]  the resistance. Only you can get this live feed out. Only you can share the video. It
[01:09:34.830 --> 01:09:37.630]  banned out video. I don't know how long we'll be on air folks. They're trying to shut us
[01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:40.950]  down. That's why I'm here seven days a week. Now let's look at these documents and we're
[01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:44.390]  going to close this out. Folks. We'll cover it more on the Sunday show four to six PM.
[01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:50.950]  No vaccine, no service. How vaccinations may affect travel plans in the future. CNBC
[01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:54.790]  second generation COVID vaccines are coming because they're saying the first ones don't
[01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:58.790]  work. Oh really? And the second and the third won't work till you wake up. They'll work
[01:09:58.790 --> 01:10:06.030]  to kill you plan now to speed vaccine supply to future pandemics. Yes, nature. And it goes
[01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:10.390]  on and on and on. And here it is. Bill Gates admits that as many as 700,000 people will
[01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:17.710]  get sick or die from the vaccine. And it goes on and on and on. And China is in charge of
[01:10:17.710 --> 01:10:24.670]  the tracking and the control. So Mike Halperin in closing here, we're going to spend a few
[01:10:24.670 --> 01:10:28.510]  minutes here and finish up. Take your time. Other data points. You want to hit other
[01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:32.110]  areas you want to hit. You've done a great job briefing me on this. Rob news and a splendid
[01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:35.830]  job as well. The cruise. And I mean that they're up here working seven days a week. When I
[01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:40.230]  give a handout to the cruise is very stressful folks, knowing this is happening, admitting
[01:10:40.230 --> 01:10:44.590]  it's happening, not being under Stockholm syndrome, deciding to fight back instead of
[01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:48.510]  being victims. We're all supercharged, ready to tear each other's heads off like psychotic
[01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:53.070]  gorillas because, because this is the animating contents of Liberty. We're not going to sit
[01:10:53.070 --> 01:10:57.710]  here and go die in some ditch. We know we're being killed. We know we're under attack and
[01:10:57.710 --> 01:11:02.510]  we're going to expose and lays the individuals that are doing this to us. So that in the
[01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:08.790]  future, people know who's going to stand trial at Nuremberg 2.0. Yeah, I mean, the main thing
[01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:12.269]  that they're trying to do is separate us from other people. A lot of the targeting that
[01:11:12.269 --> 01:11:17.470]  they're talking about in the exercise is get the blacks separated from the anti-vaxxers
[01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:21.670]  separate the Muslims from the Jews. They don't want groups of people. Isolate us, make us
[01:11:22.230 --> 01:11:25.990]  it's in all the Facebook documents. They admit, make us depressed, make us alone. Right. And
[01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:29.910]  when you're alone, you're, you're on your phone, you're looking at the Facebook and you're
[01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:33.670]  isolated. When you start talking to people, then the word gets out. And that's what we're
[01:11:33.670 --> 01:11:36.550]  really trying to achieve here at info wars is just to get the word. I agree. And I'm
[01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:39.750]  interrupting you. Pull it up guys, pull up the jungle book car. It's the snake wants
[01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:42.470]  to hypnotize you. That's right. And that's what this is all about. The answer. Go have
[01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:46.710]  a walk, go hug somebody who cares. Yeah. It does explain to people and in the Bible start
[01:11:46.710 --> 01:11:50.070]  over, start over. Yeah. I mean, basically what they're trying to do is just isolate
[01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:55.030]  us, keep you on your app, keep you on your phone. And you're not talking to other people.
[01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:59.190]  You're not going out. You're not taking a walk with somebody. You're not going out for lunch.
[01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:03.269]  And that's what they really are afraid of because when you're isolated, you're going to go and be
[01:12:03.269 --> 01:12:08.230]  hypnotized by their marketing campaigns. One of the big parts we didn't touch on. I just want to
[01:12:08.230 --> 01:12:13.910]  touch briefly. Take your time. Is that they have a big problem and they have a problem with demand
[01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:18.150]  and they have to balance supply with demand. So the, the whole exercise, even with crimson
[01:12:18.150 --> 01:12:24.870]  contagion event, two Oh one and spars is that they need to create the problem. Everyone freaks
[01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:30.470]  out and they all demand the vaccine. They can't just roll out a vaccine. So these timelines that
[01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:36.390]  Rob was talking about, they're on purpose in exercise and in real life, because when you're
[01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:41.190]  thinking about the vaccine all day with this marketing campaigns, eventually you really are
[01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:45.510]  ready to take this vaccine when it's available. And they start off with certain groups in the
[01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:51.510]  exercise. Hopefully the readers and viewers will actually read this. And when only some people can
[01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:56.390]  get the vaccine, other people want it. It's like scarcity, artificial scarcity. It's like the
[01:12:56.390 --> 01:13:00.070]  nightclub where only some people can get in. And that South Park episode was about that. And I agree.
[01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:05.269]  Let's finish up with Cobb. Keep talking. I want to show like, like, you know, like the good panther
[01:13:05.269 --> 01:13:10.870]  Bagheera's asleep, tries to kill Mowgli saves him. But then the snake tries to hypnotize him as well.
[01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:14.870]  We have to get used to the fact they are literally trying to medically hypnotize us.
[01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:18.950]  We have to become conscious of this. And a few of the articles that we've talked about the last
[01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:23.190]  few weeks are about them being able to get children to take the vaccine without parents
[01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:27.430]  consent. They're going after your children, folks. They want to get your two California
[01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:31.510]  pass a law that 12 year olds can have a shot without burns. They're going right in for your
[01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:36.870]  kids. This is a really evil force. It's behind all this. It's not Fauci on TV. It's not these
[01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:42.390]  health officials down the street. It's really sinister people that run this whole cabal. It's
[01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:46.630]  so insane to even think about, but that's what's really going on here. Just to give everyone a
[01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:51.110]  heads up in the next few months. Hey, if you want to predict the future, it says it right in the
[01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:55.510]  documents. It says potentially you're going to be able to, you're going to get pneumonia, says it
[01:13:55.510 --> 01:14:00.390]  in the next few months. Oh, this is the most important part of everything. Read to them. Start
[01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:05.190]  over about how, okay, there's going to be brain damage. We got to pay them out. We got to let them
[01:14:05.190 --> 01:14:10.230]  know. Don't go to lawyers. There's a federal fund. We'll get you money. And there's going to be
[01:14:10.230 --> 01:14:14.870]  pneumonia too, which we know the mask causes the chemicals they put in the mask. That's right.
[01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:19.030]  Explain this. Take time on this. Okay. So the timeline, please, if you're listening,
[01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:23.830]  if you're watching, just read this document and take your own opinion for it. But after they
[01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:28.870]  released spars, nine months later, they have a vaccine. Rob talked about that. Then five months
[01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:33.830]  later, which is identical to what we're living right now, everyone else has access to it. So
[01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:39.430]  we got that vaccine in December and right now it's April. That's five months. Now everyone on TV is
[01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:43.750]  getting the vaccine. They're opening up to more groups now. So it really, they said three years,
[01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:48.070]  really nine months. They make it then five months. Everybody gets it. It's all exact. Right. And then
[01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:56.550]  so at two months later, February of 2027 in the exercise, it talks about post spars pneumonia.
[01:14:56.550 --> 01:15:02.070]  Three months after that reports of Korovax side effects began to gain track. You know what that
[01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:05.830]  is though. Once you have this, the scientist said it'll cause an auto immune response to regular
[01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:10.230]  cold viruses. And so now like the Spanish flu, your lungs will fill up with fluid and an auto
[01:15:10.230 --> 01:15:14.390]  immune response. And they're going to call it pneumonia. And what have we got? They're geniuses.
[01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:19.190]  All those graphs where the ammonia, the pneumonia deaths and the COVID deaths matched each other
[01:15:19.190 --> 01:15:24.550]  and all those wrote a paper in 2008 saying that the deaths of Spanish flu was the mask, the mask
[01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:28.710]  causing a bacterial man. These are some diabolical bastards. Now they don't talk about the mask
[01:15:28.710 --> 01:15:32.309]  inside of the exercise. They do talk about post sparse pneumonia. I think they're talking about
[01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:39.750]  mask in lockstep event 201 and crimson contagion is a mess. But in this one, they don't,
[01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:43.590]  it's just up to the viewer to put two and two together. Then five months later,
[01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:49.190]  that initial priority high risk population, which is people with preexisting conditions and health
[01:15:49.190 --> 01:15:54.070]  workers that were given the vaccine first a couple of months ago, they begin to get sick
[01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:58.630]  with little available data and numerous preexisting conditions and numerous, the quote there is
[01:15:58.630 --> 01:16:03.670]  numerous. They're getting people with like cancer and heart disease. Then you go in to get your shot
[01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:07.750]  and then later you get sick with a little available data and numerous preexisting conditions.
[01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:13.190]  Initial studies were unable to identify a statistically significant association because
[01:16:13.190 --> 01:16:18.470]  it's binary or it's even three weapons or four. I mean, people don't know this at UT right now.
[01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:23.190]  They're already releasing a fly that lays a thing on the back of the head of a fire and then eats
[01:16:23.190 --> 01:16:27.510]  its brain like the movie alien. Uh, we've got carp in a little lake. We have that have been
[01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:32.550]  sterilized with one chemical. They just put a few drops in when their baby fish and sterilizes them.
[01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:37.110]  The globalists are doing this to us. That's what all this is. That's right. And so even nine months
[01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:40.389]  after that, it says, if you want to predict the future and let all your family and friends know,
[01:16:40.389 --> 01:16:46.870]  it says in nine months after that, they're going to say that spars or in this case, COVID-19 pandemic
[01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:53.110]  is over, but experts remain concerned about domestic animal reservoirs and the potential
[01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:58.630]  for future outbreaks. We see that on the news every day, new variants for new vaccines. And now
[01:16:58.630 --> 01:17:03.110]  we're in a new world. We're post COVID it's post COVID, but you still need to take your shot. It
[01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:06.710]  never ends, but they may even come out and say, COVID-19 has ended, but you still have to take
[01:17:06.710 --> 01:17:12.070]  your shot. Well, absolutely incredible. And that's why we're spending hours here getting this out.
[01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:15.910]  And we've only scratched the surface. We really have, but look at the lockdown. What happened
[01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:19.590]  with the lockdown? They closed bars and restaurants. That was the big thing. They closed. That's where
[01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:24.470]  people gather and talk without the phone, giving you the messages. So you get those messages from
[01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:29.350]  it was forcing you into it because exactly medical studies show about half the public is in a near
[01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:35.030]  medical trance, a daydream. They wanted to induce others into it because it's not working and get
[01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:38.950]  more control, more depression. And so they lock everybody up. You're getting the messages. Now you
[01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:43.430]  want the vaccine so you could get unlocked up. And so that, that gets everybody pushed into the
[01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:47.750]  maxi, but that's where the revolution started. It started in bars in Boston. That's where it started.
[01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:51.190]  That's where people got together and said, we're sick of this crap. We're going to start talking.
[01:17:51.190 --> 01:17:54.710]  We're going to start speaking out against it. We're going to start putting pamphlets out,
[01:17:54.710 --> 01:17:59.110]  which is what we're doing today. We're literally in a bar when we sneeze on each other and shake
[01:17:59.110 --> 01:18:03.670]  hands. We're just like cells giving each other data to beat microbes. We're humans, right? We're
[01:18:03.670 --> 01:18:07.670]  supposed to share all that stuff. Oh yeah. And all the studies show makes it stronger. Instead,
[01:18:07.670 --> 01:18:11.430]  we're not sharing it. We're not sharing it anymore. Our immune systems are getting weaker.
[01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:15.030]  And then, Oh, you're going to take this vaccine. Yeah. It's a binary weapon six months down the
[01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:18.950]  road. But if you really want to look at stuff, go back to last year, February at this time,
[01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:23.270]  when you had Dr. Francis boil on, he was telling you what was in the disease and where it came
[01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:29.430]  from all the way back to North Carolina. China lied. Why would that? Yeah, exactly. I mean,
[01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:33.030]  we were saying it really, it came from the lab. It didn't come from a bat. There's no way. And
[01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:37.830]  there's still even now you can kind of feel that the CDC director, the former CDC director finally
[01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:42.309]  came and said, well, I don't think he came and I'm allowed to have my opinion. That's the former CDC
[01:18:42.309 --> 01:18:46.470]  director who was basically a Fauci's little listen. We have the Indian and Australian
[01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:51.030]  scientists and the discoverer of HIV scanned it with electron microscopes. It's fricking
[01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:56.309]  Frankenstein dude. It's got five viruses together. It is. And we're right again, but folks, here's
[01:18:56.309 --> 01:19:02.870]  the deal. So far, this is a three-year drill. We're a little more than a year into the drill
[01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:08.710]  and it's happening exactly as the drill says now within six months or less, massive brain damage,
[01:19:08.710 --> 01:19:12.309]  massive death. You already see it happening. That's just because it's so strong. It's not
[01:19:12.309 --> 01:19:15.430]  supposed to kill you right away, but it's so strong. Like Gates said, well, it's got to be
[01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:19.590]  really strong. It's supposed to hit you a year later. We are about to see all hell break loose.
[01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:25.190]  I just got chills. And that's what this is all about. It's a timeline that they are following
[01:19:25.190 --> 01:19:30.790]  their minions like Saki on TV or the difference. The pastor, we have articles about them hiring
[01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:38.309]  pastors to deliver to the black. They've all got, they've all got the spars report and it's a script.
[01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:43.190]  They're like people in a college acting club. They're just following the fricking script.
[01:19:43.190 --> 01:19:45.990]  Well, those little pages, there are little exercises for you to think about,
[01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:47.990]  for you and your minions to talk about how are we going to work?
[01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:52.150]  Here's your script. Okay. We're glad you're in the play. Memorize your lines. Here it is.
[01:19:52.150 --> 01:19:54.389]  And that's what this, it actually says it on the website,
[01:19:55.110 --> 01:20:00.230]  healthsecurity.org that this whole thing is to train. It's not for us to be viewing. We're just
[01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:04.870]  taking the time to view it. It's for their people in different areas to get familiar with this
[01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:10.470]  terminology so that when it actually rolls out, they know the correct response to conspiracy
[01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:15.030]  theories also proliferated across social media, suggesting that the virus had purposefully
[01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:18.950]  been created and introduced to the population by drug companies, or that it had escaped from
[01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:22.630]  a government lab, secretly testing bioweapons, which is now admitted. So when we come out and
[01:20:22.630 --> 01:20:26.070]  say that, or someone says that they already have a line for, they've already thought about it and
[01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:28.710]  they have the correct response. I agree. Let me show them the stack of documents. It says it on
[01:20:28.710 --> 01:20:32.630]  the front. If you guys go show the front cover public health risk communicators, that's who this
[01:20:32.630 --> 01:20:38.230]  is for. Public health risk communicators. Public health risk communicators. That is who it's for.
[01:20:38.230 --> 01:20:42.950]  That is to train those people on how to talk to people about this and how to push out the
[01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:47.350]  next version of it. This is an absolute takeover. And here's the good news. We have the enemy's
[01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:52.309]  blueprint. These little bastards think we're too dumb to read this. They think we're supposed to
[01:20:52.309 --> 01:20:57.590]  be at home watching football right now or whatever the hell's on. Guess what? I'm not. My wife,
[01:20:57.590 --> 01:21:00.630]  my children are at home and I'm here protecting them as a man. And we're going to fight you.
[01:21:00.630 --> 01:21:04.710]  We're going to expose you. Look at this. This is lockstep, which is admitting the global
[01:21:04.710 --> 01:21:09.990]  government takeover, Rockefeller foundation, 2010, mandatory quarantines, lockdowns,
[01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:14.150]  force mask, tighter, top-down government control, and more authoritarian leadership
[01:21:14.150 --> 01:21:18.470]  with limited innovation and growing citizen pushback. The new dark ages. Can you zoom in
[01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:25.670]  on that guys? And it's exactly what's happening now and 10 folks. And it's all every damn bit of
[01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:30.550]  it. It comes out of China. It's the model of the world. They lock everything down. We never come
[01:21:30.550 --> 01:21:35.510]  out of it. You know, Alex, there's been prominent people who saw your video of you talking about
[01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:40.870]  this back in 2010. And we're like, how did you know? You're just reading the plan. You just read
[01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:45.270]  it on the air. You had lunch with me with a former head of two us intelligence agencies. Yeah. They
[01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:49.350]  were like, we saw that video. And I'm like, you saw that I was showing a document, but they were
[01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:54.150]  well, there's a lot of documents and there's not a lot of Rockefeller documents. These people run
[01:21:54.150 --> 01:21:59.190]  the dam. The Rockefellers created the UN. The Rockefellers created Bill Gates. They created
[01:21:59.190 --> 01:22:04.870]  Hitler. They put linen in fricking power, dude. They run the show. And the guy, Rick Bright,
[01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:09.750]  you talked about earlier, Alex, he was running Crimson Contagion Exercise. He's now running the
[01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:14.870]  Rockefeller Center for Health. That article that you had earlier. But instead, the cute thing was
[01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:19.110]  control and bad opposition to lead our movement. But if the cute thing would have just said,
[01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:25.830]  here's the name of the document. You're not supposed to see it. Spars 20, 25, 28. Everyone
[01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:29.670]  would have run out, but see, it never used that esoteric power. I'm just up here with documents
[01:22:29.670 --> 01:22:34.389]  and proof and meeting with the intelligence chiefs and all everything. And it's like, yeah, whatever
[01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:39.830]  Alex Jones, you know, it's like, I mean, it's all right here, folks. We're not giving it to
[01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:44.870]  you. Esoteric. We're naming names. We're telling you who they are. We're risking our lives together
[01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:48.870]  because this is so real. And we're not asking you to trust the plan. We're actually asking you to
[01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:53.510]  read the plan. Just read the plan. You'll see it for yourself. Yeah. As you read this, you're
[01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:56.790]  like, Oh, this is happening right now. This happened last week. I mean, that's what, that's
[01:22:56.790 --> 01:23:00.230]  what we've been looking at this while. It's like, Oh, this will happen next week. It happens next
[01:23:00.230 --> 01:23:04.550]  week. Yeah. I mean, it's all here and you can read it and you can write down on your calendar.
[01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:08.230]  When these things are going to happen, it'll be within two weeks, probably of it, of it happening
[01:23:08.230 --> 01:23:13.190]  in here and happening in real life. That's how crazy it is. And it's sick what these people are
[01:23:13.190 --> 01:23:17.110]  doing to us. And it's whenever people in Canada got the documents almost like eight, nine months
[01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:21.430]  ago, like, and there'll be locked down three at this date. And it, and it happened because it was
[01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:25.670]  a real document cruise. Like, is this a real document? I said, that's a Canadian government
[01:23:25.670 --> 01:23:30.790]  document. Of course it's real. I said, search the terms and we searched it. And there was in
[01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:37.270]  hundreds of other documents from the UN. It was, of course it was real. These people, the UN is the
[01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:42.070]  top of that pyramid sending out information to all these other countries that want to work with it.
[01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:45.750]  I would just glance briefly over this book. It's published by Chelsea Clinton. It's like
[01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:51.830]  global health, something like that. I barely even read it, but they're admitting that their
[01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:56.550]  world government, their world domination is through health. So we're just basically looking
[01:23:56.550 --> 01:24:01.910]  at their plans. This is the core of their operation, of their attack. And the contact
[01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:06.070]  tracer, she talks about that? Yeah, she talks about it. Let me show people this since you mentioned it.
[01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:11.030]  The part of Crimson Contagion and Event 201 and all this that they launched during the attack
[01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:15.910]  is ending the cycle of crisis and complacency in the US global health security. It's a consortium
[01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:21.190]  of these groups meeting. And they say right in here, oh, we're going to get a lot of people sick
[01:24:22.710 --> 01:24:25.750]  when they take the vaccines. It's going to turn off their immune systems.
[01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:29.590]  They're going to get sick from microbes and all this, but we'll just have to cover it up.
[01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:36.630]  Look at all this right here. And it's the word you used. I just looked up this,
[01:24:36.630 --> 01:24:40.470]  the definition of medicalization. That's what we're going under right now. We're going under
[01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:45.110]  medicalization. And you talked about that eight days ago. You know, if you just look at,
[01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:47.750]  we're just looking at this information and showing people what's going to happen,
[01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:50.950]  and then it comes true. And that's the crazy part. We've been talking about this for years,
[01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:55.670]  the brain eating vaccines, everything. Well, it's very simple. I talk about a binary weapon.
[01:24:55.670 --> 01:25:00.630]  You can give someone a poison and then you have the antidote. They don't know what the antidote
[01:25:00.630 --> 01:25:04.710]  is. So I gave you a poison. You're dead in 20 days. Won't start killing you for about 10.
[01:25:04.710 --> 01:25:08.230]  Go kill this person. I'll give you the antidote. The Japanese would do that to some of their
[01:25:08.230 --> 01:25:12.070]  killers. And I mean, that's all this is. They're just making us sick. So they own us and control
[01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:15.750]  us. And we're already getting used to this. Okay. A bunch of people are dying. Old people.
[01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:19.430]  Oh, Hank Aaron took it on TV. He's dead now. Marvelous Marvin Hagler. He's dead now. They're
[01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:23.190]  just getting us ready. It says it right here, guys. It says the group debated whether it was
[01:25:23.190 --> 01:25:27.830]  appropriate for the president to acknowledge the sacrifice that vaccine recipients had made
[01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:32.790]  on behalf of their community of the sacrifice or to console them in their grief over that sacrifice.
[01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:36.550]  They're just rolling this whole out and they're going to have a mental health, behavioral health.
[01:25:37.190 --> 01:25:41.910]  I just heard a record skip. Start over. Explain. That's in the document that people are going to
[01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:45.830]  get hurt by this will make them heroes that they got hurt. Oh, don't criticize how the
[01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:49.510]  kids sterilize from chemicals in the water. Don't criticize how your wife has breast cancer from,
[01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:54.389]  from the atrazine and the bisphenol A. No, no, no. Don't, don't criticize those that
[01:25:54.389 --> 01:25:58.790]  got really sick with the vaccine. They're heroes. Can you read it again? Yep. The group
[01:25:58.790 --> 01:26:03.110]  debated whether it was appropriate for the president to acknowledge the sacrifice that
[01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:08.790]  vaccine recipients had made on behalf of their communities or to console them in their grief
[01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:14.309]  over that sacrifice. So this, the end of the exercise is about how do we handle people's
[01:26:14.309 --> 01:26:19.430]  children dying their grandma just die, or she has encephalitis or neurological symptoms.
[01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:23.350]  They're saying they're going to send mental health, behavioral health people to either come
[01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:26.870]  to your house or on TV, or the president's even going to come out and say, thank you so much for
[01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:31.270]  your sacrifice for participating in that. Exactly. They're not going to deny that the vaccines hurt
[01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:35.350]  people now, like Bill Gates said, they're just going to say you're a hero, but you got to take
[01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:39.670]  it. It's the greater good defense. This is for the greater good. So you had to do this. And if
[01:26:39.670 --> 01:26:44.630]  you didn't do this, everybody would be next is throw your daughter into a volcano. Sure. I mean,
[01:26:44.630 --> 01:26:51.750]  it's literally just Aztec stuff for the greater good or chop off her boobs. That'd be the next
[01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:58.790]  thing. Maker boy, man. I tell you guys, great job crew. Great job putting all this together.
[01:26:59.750 --> 01:27:03.750]  We're going to take this, you know, it probably won't air until five or six nights. The crew's
[01:27:03.750 --> 01:27:06.950]  got to go fix some of the things, add a few documents, get it ready. We're going to stream
[01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:14.389]  it and post it to Bando video. I don't even know what, what headline Mike, Rob, John over there,
[01:27:14.389 --> 01:27:19.350]  the crew in there. What headline would we give this? I mean, how do you come up with a headline
[01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:25.670]  that's evil enough to get people to wake up? Cause it's so evil. It's like, I'm in the name of the
[01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:30.470]  event. What do you say about this? Documents discovered showing pandemic
[01:27:33.190 --> 01:27:41.670]  plan takeover. I mean, I don't, I don't or, or John Hopkins war games, preparing public for
[01:27:41.670 --> 01:27:46.790]  mass vaccine damage. I mean, what do you say to this as far as 20, 25 to 20, 28, the future,
[01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:54.630]  or is it now? I think it's now John Hopkins document details plan to use vaccines to collapse
[01:27:54.630 --> 01:28:00.150]  society. Rob, I mean, our total takeover is society, either one, which is basically the
[01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:05.350]  collapse of society. So, well, they want to post industrial world. Yeah. I won't, that doesn't work.
[01:28:05.350 --> 01:28:09.590]  I mean, and the modus it's America mainly taking this. I mean, this is America being injected by
[01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:13.990]  the UN, the chicoms to die. And, and they've already got people at the border ready to come
[01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:16.950]  in. So, and they're going to keep bringing those guys. That's just going to get worse.
[01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:20.950]  That's the freaky part about this document is it's all American names for everything.
[01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:25.670]  It's not resilient names. It's not a world health. This is United States of America with
[01:28:25.670 --> 01:28:29.190]  president talking about the president's on here. We didn't get into that. It talks about there's
[01:28:29.190 --> 01:28:33.910]  two democratic presidents and one steps down. It's America. That's global. It's captured,
[01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:39.990]  directing the destruction of the West for the chicoms. Unbelievable. I don't know what to call
[01:28:39.990 --> 01:28:44.550]  this. I don't know what to say about this, but again, we're following exactly with what it says.
[01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:50.150]  It's in real time. Just move the years back three years. And next it's just going to accelerate.
[01:28:50.150 --> 01:28:53.190]  And you're going to see it all happen. You're already seeing the death. You're already seeing
[01:28:53.190 --> 01:28:56.790]  the convulsions. You're already seeing the rashes. You're already seeing the, the, the,
[01:28:56.790 --> 01:29:02.550]  the brain fog. You're seeing the studies admitting it. And we'll just be heroes. The news will say,
[01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:07.190]  well, everybody's dying. Oh, it's a new COVID doing it. Well, maybe Gates does have a point
[01:29:07.190 --> 01:29:11.430]  in eliminating some of these people, but we are human beings and it's not enough to just read
[01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:14.790]  these documents. It's you have to share them. You have to get this information out. Well,
[01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:18.309]  let me, here's the deal. Okay. You want to kill old people. That's bad enough. Because once you
[01:29:18.309 --> 01:29:23.750]  do that, who's next? We, we just slippery slope. Now it's give it to little children. Come on.
[01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:27.670]  It never ends and pregnant women because they want to kill the next generation or make them
[01:29:27.670 --> 01:29:30.630]  infertile. Cause that's what's going to happen. You're either going to come on. I mean, Bill
[01:29:30.630 --> 01:29:35.430]  Gates went out and like euthanized himself, you know, jumped in a lake of liquid nitrogen or
[01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:39.430]  something or shot himself off in a rocket. I would respect him, but no, he wants the earth
[01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:44.630]  for himself. And, but I will say this, if the public doesn't get upset about this and say, no,
[01:29:44.630 --> 01:29:50.070]  if governors don't take action, we deserve it. I mean, they are doing this to us and we've put
[01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:55.590]  out enough information and people know how to make it go viral. So you deserve what you get.
[01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:59.190]  If you don't do anything. Yeah. It's not enough to, if you don't pitch a fit and we could easily
[01:29:59.190 --> 01:30:03.350]  just bury this or just, you know, kept it for ourselves. We chose to put ourselves on the line
[01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:07.350]  to share this information because whoever reads this or even just watches this video,
[01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:11.830]  you may save that person's life. And that's real. And of course, if they even respond to it,
[01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:16.630]  the enemy will target this or target little parts of that. The documents give the diseases,
[01:30:16.630 --> 01:30:21.990]  the same names, timelines. It's all how to counter us, how to do it. It's all right there. I'm going
[01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:26.309]  to say this in closing word of mouth is King. I just want to win the war. Plus we need financial

[01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:17.510]  vaccine is going to kill people and cause absolute destruction in mass. And we've said a lot,
[01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:21.350]  both of you, 60 second closing comment, Rob Do. I'm just going to say, share this video,
[01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:25.510]  share this video. That's all you could do. Share this video and read this document for yourself
[01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:28.470]  because you don't have to believe any of us. You don't have to believe our takes on it. Read the
[01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:31.910]  document. It's all going to come out to you. It's all going to be hitting you right in the face as

[01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:47.430]  all in the document. So check it out. The spars pandemic, 2025 to 2020. Our life expectancy is
[01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:53.350]  imploding. Our infant mortality is exploding. We're being murdered. Yeah. Closing statement
[01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:59.510]  for me is that Alex, you know, 10 years ago, you released the Rockefeller document, the lockstep.
[01:31:59.510 --> 01:32:03.830]  You put yourself on the line. You put that out there. Everyone who's watching this, listening to
[01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:09.590]  this can be that person for this. We've put together Crimson Contagion Event 201 and spars

[01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:18.870]  life. That's right. All right. Fabulous job crew. I'm going to tell everybody this is going to air
[01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:23.990]  it five o'clock. We'll get this done in two hours guys or get it done at six. What do you want?
[01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:27.030]  Want to stream this at five or stream this at six?
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:36.240]  All right. Hey, I love you all. I appreciate you. The ball's in your court. If you don't
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:39.880]  care about your own life, your own future, at least care about children, research this
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:44.519]  information, find out it's true, and then take action. God bless and good luck. All
[01:32:44.519 --> 01:32:50.760]  right, ladies and gentlemen, keep us on air. We'll continue to bring you the band guests.
[01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:54.840]  We'll continue to bring the information that no one else will touch. I'm going to get into
[01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:59.280]  some of that coming up here in the third hour. Keep us on air. Go to info war store.com.
[01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:03.599]  We're really excited to announce this. And quite frankly, I'm thrilled. We have a new
[01:33:03.599 --> 01:33:07.880]  sleep aid. We can't get enough sleep aids. As far as I'm concerned, a new sleep aid at
[01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:15.920]  info war store.com down and out sleep support. This is a liquid tincture. Pretty much similar
[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:20.920]  to the rocket rest that is so popular, but this is in a link with a liquid tincture
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:27.559]  formula. So a little more easily absorbable and the effects will be probably quicker.
[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:31.320]  But I'm going to test this out for myself and I'll give you a review,
[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:36.120]  but a new sleep aid down and out is on sale at info war store.com.
