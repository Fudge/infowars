[00:00.000 --> 00:16.640]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[00:16.640 --> 00:26.440]  Here we are my friends live on this Easter transmission. I want to thank the crew for
[00:26.440 --> 00:29.440]  being here doing a great job on this very important day for those of us who believe
[00:29.440 --> 00:33.680]  in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ wouldn't be here wouldn't be alive
[00:33.680 --> 00:38.880]  wouldn't be able to do what we do without Christ and sacrifice that's what
[00:38.880 --> 00:46.360]  we build our fortress upon well here we are on this Sunday edition and I say
[00:46.360 --> 00:52.920]  this a lot I didn't say this a lot 25 years ago 20 years ago even 10 years
[00:52.920 --> 00:58.440]  ago but I I say it a couple times a week now and it's absolutely true that
[00:58.440 --> 01:05.280]  every show gets more intense and just more insane and what's happening becomes
[01:05.280 --> 01:11.880]  more surreal by the moment and if you're paying attention yeah April 12th 2020 is
[01:11.880 --> 01:17.160]  more science-fictiony more dystopic more out of control more big brother on
[01:17.160 --> 01:22.760]  steroids than the type of news you'd see in a year before and stuff going on in
[01:22.760 --> 01:28.320]  one day is like a year of tyranny condensed down and it's more and more
[01:28.320 --> 01:31.920]  intense and I've said this a thousand times I've got all these clips all this
[01:31.920 --> 01:36.320]  news all this incredible stuff to cover I'm explaining something here that's
[01:36.320 --> 01:44.600]  more critical than all the news when Hitler was lining up on the border with
[01:44.600 --> 01:48.960]  Poland and building his armies and getting the troops and doing surveillance
[01:48.960 --> 01:55.080]  the Poles were like we're about to be invaded and they said your conspiracy
[01:55.080 --> 01:58.920]  terrorist doesn't matter they're massing troops well finally when the Germans
[01:58.920 --> 02:03.680]  attacked people didn't deny that the Poles were right didn't matter by then
[02:03.680 --> 02:07.920]  they were defeated they'd have been dug in and ready and if folks elicit their
[02:07.920 --> 02:11.840]  military they would have been able to put up a bigger fight it's the same story
[02:11.840 --> 02:19.680]  over and over again how did Hitler invade Poland Operation Hemler a subgroup
[02:19.680 --> 02:24.680]  of that was Operation Gliwitz they blew up their own military bases and radio
[02:24.680 --> 02:29.840]  stations had Jewish prisoners they dressed up in Polish and German uniforms
[02:29.840 --> 02:34.880]  so that be real shot them and then laid them out for the news reels they had
[02:34.880 --> 02:41.960]  ready to be run back and aired on the theaters and the audio over radio but
[02:41.960 --> 02:46.240]  the Germans had big free movie theaters on every street that the Nazis did and
[02:46.240 --> 02:49.600]  people would run in for free and you know watch the film reels and run back
[02:49.600 --> 02:54.800]  out very good at propaganda back of that time kind of the internet of the day and
[02:54.800 --> 02:59.600]  it came out in the Nuremberg trials the Nazis staged that to launch World War
[02:59.600 --> 03:05.800]  2 well the globalists are using COVID-19 to launch the globalist takeover and I
[03:05.800 --> 03:11.320]  got up this morning at 6 a.m. got a nice cup of coffee sat down at the kitchen
[03:11.320 --> 03:20.160]  table and opened up the iPad and the first article I saw was a daily mail
[03:20.160 --> 03:25.480]  link on info wars.com and I went well there's no need to just surf around in
[03:25.480 --> 03:30.240]  force I'll just go to drugs you'll have it no one over there and sure enough drugs you had it
[03:30.240 --> 03:33.920]  and then I went and read the Chinese document the Chinese government admits
[03:33.920 --> 03:41.800]  is real and it was like I had seven or eight cups of coffee in about 30 minutes
[03:41.800 --> 03:48.920]  I only had that one cup of coffee but I was lit I was so awake so on fire my
[03:48.920 --> 03:54.960]  wife got about 8 a.m. the kids were waking up my son's moved out now he's
[03:54.960 --> 03:59.160]  almost 18 but my three daughters got up they're like dad what are you doing
[03:59.160 --> 04:04.240]  because they can just see I was like this and I said guys I've just got to
[04:04.240 --> 04:07.440]  figure out some way to go on air and make sure everybody realizes how
[04:07.440 --> 04:11.040]  important this is because the listeners of the real power and if Trump
[04:11.040 --> 04:15.240]  understands this and if everybody understands this we can defeat the
[04:15.240 --> 04:22.280]  entire new order right now instead of have them have their takeover which is
[04:22.280 --> 04:26.480]  implantable microchips forced inoculations world government martial
[04:26.480 --> 04:34.000]  law it's all being announced as the solution China admits that they develop
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.280]  COVID-19 in the Wuhan lab why have they suddenly released this information
[04:38.280 --> 04:43.080]  for British intelligence the Daily Mail I'm gonna tell you why when we come back
[04:43.080 --> 04:49.840]  this is so big China is now admitting that they developed it in the lab but
[04:49.840 --> 04:54.600]  we'll tell you why that's the key when we return
[04:59.000 --> 05:05.920]  when one studies history and human nature you learn very quickly that rugged
[05:05.920 --> 05:11.440]  individualism and people to think for themselves build free societies innovate
[05:11.440 --> 05:16.600]  to amazing things but those that love to grovel those that love to be
[05:16.600 --> 05:21.360]  subservient those that love to comply and think that it's a virtue they create
[05:21.360 --> 05:28.840]  stagnation corruption tyranny and then finally collapse and the world is now
[05:28.840 --> 05:34.200]  being tested and we're seeing lots of dutiful individuals who've complied
[05:34.200 --> 05:38.320]  and submitted their whole lives believing if they just submit now in a
[05:38.320 --> 05:43.640]  bigger way somehow they'll create a heavenly future but the technocrats
[05:43.640 --> 05:49.640]  running the global system are oppressive and anti-human and are
[05:49.640 --> 05:55.880]  psychotic and are building an anti-human future submission to them is like tying a
[05:55.880 --> 06:16.920]  big boulder on your neck and throwing into the ocean the national agency
[06:16.920 --> 06:28.320]  overseeing biological research virology to take engineering in China
[06:28.320 --> 06:40.160]  released last night a lengthy document to the daily mail and in it we're gonna
[06:40.160 --> 06:45.160]  be reading directly from it here in a moment it states that the communist
[06:45.160 --> 06:53.840]  Chinese government since 2012 has received a large group of grants from a
[06:53.840 --> 07:10.160]  certain group to develop weaponized gain of function common cold or what we
[07:10.160 --> 07:19.000]  know as the coronavirus did you hear what I just said the communist Chinese on
[07:19.000 --> 07:24.480]  Saturday morning released to what is probably one of the biggest publications
[07:24.480 --> 07:45.840]  in the world the Daily Mail a document stating that they did indeed test with
[07:45.840 --> 07:54.400]  bats in the Wuhan level 4 bio weapons lab coronaviruses that they took out of
[07:54.400 --> 08:02.520]  bats and injected into piglets and when the piglets died from it they ground up
[08:02.520 --> 08:12.280]  the piglets and fed it to other piglets now that's just one of the studies now
[08:12.280 --> 08:26.000]  why would the communist Chinese release that information global bombs China
[08:26.000 --> 08:31.040]  admits to harvesting and testing COVID-19 like coronaviruses at Wuhan lab
[08:31.040 --> 08:34.960]  they actually say COVID-19 in the document but it's a whole host of them
[08:34.960 --> 08:40.440]  hundreds they harvest it so they told you it came from bats partially that's
[08:40.440 --> 08:44.920]  true but not out of the market and you've seen US Intelligence Committee of
[08:44.920 --> 08:51.040]  the Senate say that you've seen top Indian laboratories come out and say
[08:51.040 --> 08:55.960]  we scan the virus it's man-made it's been altered it's been gene edited RNA
[08:55.960 --> 09:04.040]  spliced super advanced stuff stuff they think the chai comms can't even do so
[09:04.040 --> 09:10.320]  what did the author of the US biological weapons law who practices law the
[09:10.320 --> 09:15.280]  Hague represents presidents and prime ministers and who helped write the
[09:15.280 --> 09:20.000]  world law on this say here nine weeks ago who's joining us next hour dr.
[09:20.000 --> 09:30.360]  Francis Boyle you know the guy with three Harvard degrees he said nine weeks
[09:30.360 --> 09:38.120]  ago that it's a US made bio weapon given to the Chinese to be spliced with these
[09:38.120 --> 09:46.200]  airborne coronaviruses the bats have to give a gain of function and that while
[09:46.200 --> 09:49.440]  it's all being blamed on Trump it's gonna happen to the economy he predicted
[09:49.440 --> 09:54.920]  that that it's Obama and Hillary and Fauci who were over it at the NIH who
[09:54.920 --> 10:03.600]  allowed the programs from 2012 to 2017 because Obama funded into the year
[10:03.600 --> 10:09.280]  Trump was elected and got into office that they allowed the transfer of this
[10:09.280 --> 10:21.000]  to the communist Chinese to develop this airborne bio weapon and now the
[10:21.000 --> 10:29.240]  communist Chinese come out and they released this document to the mail
[10:29.240 --> 10:33.560]  saying yes it turns out we lied to you we said we weren't working with
[10:33.560 --> 10:41.560]  coronaviruses or bats the laboratory but it wasn't zoological it is but the US
[10:41.560 --> 10:48.960]  government and Obama funded us now this morning the headline on that story this
[10:48.960 --> 10:54.640]  is when you really know it's huge this morning the headline on that article
[10:54.640 --> 10:59.440]  from the Daily Mail read Wuhan lab was performing coronavirus experiments on
[10:59.440 --> 11:04.120]  bats from the caves where the disease is believed to have originated with a
[11:04.120 --> 11:09.880]  three million pound grant from the USA that was the headline this morning I
[11:09.880 --> 11:14.640]  have audio files I sent to all the writers and everyone saying I predict
[11:14.640 --> 11:18.320]  prime projection because the Daily Mail isn't in on it they got in my sick
[11:18.320 --> 11:24.440]  working there but the chai comms gave them this that they will later change it
[11:24.440 --> 11:29.240]  to make the focus the US that this is a mistake in the article that the main
[11:29.240 --> 11:33.240]  Chinese thrust of the document is to blame America but the article didn't
[11:33.240 --> 11:38.440]  blame America blame China so I predict they will change the headline that's in
[11:38.440 --> 11:42.680]  the audio folks just happened 10 minutes ago the show was starting I said oh
[11:42.680 --> 11:46.480]  it hasn't started yet boom rise we go live they put the article up they
[11:46.480 --> 11:53.360]  changed it as I foresaw because I have learned how they operate how did I know
[11:53.360 --> 11:59.120]  this and it's not about me bragging that I know how this stuff works now it's
[11:59.120 --> 12:03.600]  it's a formula the whole article demonizes America and says it's our
[12:03.600 --> 12:07.880]  fault and China deserves no blame and the UN says it's a global phenomenon and
[12:07.880 --> 12:12.520]  don't blame China and it goes on to say anyways the United States is the blame
[12:12.520 --> 12:16.640]  they gave us the money to do it this is a way of saying you better shut this down
[12:16.640 --> 12:20.760]  you better stop blaming China or we're gonna expose the deep state used us to
[12:20.760 --> 12:28.440]  develop illegal weapons and I said the article headline doesn't blame us but
[12:28.440 --> 12:33.320]  the article does while admitting that they lied to the world and have this
[12:33.320 --> 12:40.480]  lab and that it was weaponized and they developed COVID-19 how huge is that so
[12:40.480 --> 12:45.000]  they then changed the headline just now as you just saw I showed TV viewers on
[12:45.000 --> 12:52.520]  my phone the screenshot why did I do it knew they were gonna kill it now there's
[12:52.520 --> 12:55.800]  a thousand other data points that's the problem my show is I could just state
[12:55.800 --> 12:59.280]  what's going on it'd be much easier but I tend to just start I'll show you this
[12:59.280 --> 13:03.760]  piece I'll say that piece I didn't show you a hundred of the pieces literally my
[13:03.760 --> 13:07.760]  brain's been on fire since this morning a hundred of the pieces because I've
[13:07.760 --> 13:10.560]  already studied each piece and interviewed all the real experts and I
[13:10.560 --> 13:17.280]  know it's coming next but let me explain something right now war is coming when
[13:17.280 --> 13:23.080]  Bill Maher got up Friday night and said this is the Chinese virus and it came
[13:23.080 --> 13:26.760]  out of their labs because of their bad practices with food and if it was on
[13:26.760 --> 13:32.800]  purpose war is gonna start and it may be on purpose that's now the talking point
[13:32.800 --> 13:36.680]  even in the left of the establishment because they realize they've been caught
[13:36.680 --> 13:41.880]  the Chinese are now blackmailing the left who sent them this from plan they
[13:41.880 --> 13:47.120]  had down another avenue but when Trump beat them and beat the impeachment a
[13:47.120 --> 13:51.200]  deep-state group with China told them go ahead and incubate in your population
[13:51.200 --> 13:55.560]  used to suppress Taiwan used to suppress the uprisings and we're gonna
[13:55.560 --> 13:59.520]  then say you're doing a great job through the UN but when it hits America
[13:59.520 --> 14:09.160]  we're then gonna blame Trump and blame him for the economy and removing well I
[14:09.160 --> 14:14.160]  didn't you say that today I said that nine weeks ago I saw the path I said
[14:14.160 --> 14:18.400]  that's an enemy tech profile the pieces we have fit to that but we're not sure
[14:18.400 --> 14:22.440]  that's it until we see more happen and then just as we broke down the battle
[14:22.440 --> 14:27.900]  path it all laid in and now every piece just laid in total proof because in the
[14:27.900 --> 14:36.520]  last moments as this comes out what are they gonna do well China sees that it's
[14:36.520 --> 14:42.560]  tried to uses a weapon against the US its collaborators have Trump gets it he's
[14:42.560 --> 14:45.760]  starting to point out it came from there they know it's about to come out
[14:45.760 --> 14:49.440]  that it's man-made we already know that from the institutes in Europe and India
[14:49.440 --> 14:54.440]  that scanned it and so they're like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa okay we got it from
[14:54.440 --> 15:02.120]  you it wasn't the Wuhan lab didn't come from the weird food grocery store we're
[15:02.120 --> 15:10.000]  catching snakes everything else are at but it's an accident stop it that is the
[15:10.000 --> 15:15.400]  point we've gotten to now because Trump can move the entire deep state global
[15:15.400 --> 15:26.800]  system and their allies who he has in check right now into checkmate we already
[15:26.800 --> 15:33.400]  had them in check I mean victory is but I see a thousand levels under this folks
[15:33.400 --> 15:36.600]  I'm telling you Pentagon Trump I know you're listening just listen to me I know
[15:36.600 --> 15:40.400]  you already know this act on your instincts this is we have them now this
[15:40.400 --> 15:45.000]  is it we will we don't happen you can't keep the dragon around as an enemy it's
[15:45.000 --> 15:48.720]  got to be destroyed and and we can do this with the globalists that serve it
[15:48.720 --> 15:52.720]  now this is it I'm gonna lay it out in layman's terms we come back but
[15:52.720 --> 15:59.120]  chai comms admit weaponized COVID-19 in their weapons lab
[15:59.480 --> 16:06.680]  what our champions made of here's a man who can show you
[16:06.680 --> 16:13.720]  juggle late to fight 3339 triple late to fight 3339

[17:01.660 --> 17:03.420]  Look into it for yourself.
[17:03.420 --> 17:06.020]  Big brother and the globalists don't want you to.
[17:06.020 --> 17:08.140]  CoQ10, oh, you probably want to spend some time
[17:08.140 --> 17:10.340]  researching CoQ10.
[17:10.340 --> 17:13.700]  And then research DNA Force Plus and the types
[17:13.700 --> 17:15.740]  that we have in here.

[17:23.660 --> 17:27.500]  for Mother Nature that are known to supercharge it all.
[17:27.500 --> 17:31.460]  This is our best selling overall formula.
[17:31.460 --> 17:33.700]  And I've told listeners at the end of last year
[17:33.700 --> 17:37.340]  that we can't sell products at 50% off anymore
[17:37.340 --> 17:39.140]  because there's not enough markup in them
[17:39.140 --> 17:41.020]  to fund our operations.
[17:41.020 --> 17:42.860]  But because of what's happening and going on
[17:42.860 --> 17:45.620]  in the world right now, I really
[17:45.620 --> 17:48.540]  want everybody who hasn't used, or tried,
[17:48.540 --> 17:51.100]  or enjoyed the benefits of DNA Force Plus
[17:51.100 --> 17:54.500]  to have DNA Force Plus for yourself and your family.
[17:54.500 --> 17:59.020]  DNA Force Plus now, 50% off.
[17:59.020 --> 18:01.340]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time
[18:01.340 --> 18:05.380]  and rattle off the successes and full verses
[18:05.380 --> 18:07.460]  that you're paying attention.
[18:07.460 --> 18:09.660]  You know we've done together.
[18:09.660 --> 18:11.940]  But I'll tell you this.
[18:11.940 --> 18:15.700]  The technocrats are really upping their game.
[18:15.700 --> 18:19.700]  And they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[18:19.700 --> 18:21.980]  They're trying to shudder and silence human resistance.
[18:21.980 --> 18:25.740]  So now is the time to understand that everything
[18:25.740 --> 18:27.620]  we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[18:27.620 --> 18:29.420]  Everything you warned your friends and family about
[18:29.420 --> 18:30.780]  is around to be true.
[18:30.780 --> 18:33.580]  So it's now that your credibility's way up.
[18:33.580 --> 18:36.380]  The power structure's going to silence those of us
[18:36.380 --> 18:37.980]  that they can't.
[18:37.980 --> 18:42.540]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[18:42.540 --> 18:44.300]  We have the power.
[18:44.300 --> 18:46.100]  But the sun is setting on humanity
[18:46.100 --> 18:48.580]  and setting on free speech.
[18:48.580 --> 18:50.860]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now
[18:50.860 --> 18:54.140]  to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come.
[18:54.140 --> 18:55.460]  So be the polar bears you are.
[18:55.460 --> 19:03.700]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown
[19:03.700 --> 19:09.020]  in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[19:09.020 --> 19:12.940]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas
[19:12.940 --> 19:17.700]  to date, super male vitality, specifically designed
[19:17.700 --> 19:21.260]  to assist the body in regulating proper balance
[19:21.260 --> 19:24.980]  to create superior vitality in males.
[19:24.980 --> 19:28.660]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own
[19:28.660 --> 19:30.020]  natural responses.
[19:30.020 --> 19:33.340]  And it contains no synthetic chemicals
[19:33.340 --> 19:36.140]  and no unwanted additives.
[19:36.140 --> 19:36.820]  Yes.
[19:36.820 --> 19:39.820]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined
[19:39.820 --> 19:42.860]  with modern technology, working together
[19:42.860 --> 19:46.580]  in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out
[19:46.580 --> 19:48.580]  of this herb-packed formula.
[19:48.580 --> 19:49.660]  So what are you waiting for?
[19:49.660 --> 19:51.540]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[19:51.540 --> 19:54.180]  Never been a better time than right now.
[19:54.180 --> 19:57.940]  Super male vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[20:02.260 --> 20:05.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:12.620 --> 20:17.420]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide,
[20:17.420 --> 20:20.660]  it's Alex Jones.
[20:20.660 --> 20:28.020]  I know you've deceived me, now here's a surprise.
[20:28.020 --> 20:33.060]  I know that you have, because there's magic in my eyes.
[20:33.060 --> 20:36.380]  I can see from miles and miles.
[20:36.380 --> 20:38.180]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide
[20:38.180 --> 20:41.700]  on this Sunday transmission, the most important broadcast
[20:41.700 --> 20:42.820]  I've ever done.
[20:42.820 --> 20:44.340]  And thanks for quickening like this.
[20:44.340 --> 20:46.020]  Next week may be the biggest broadcast ever.
[20:46.020 --> 20:48.820]  We just keep breaking each record with how insane the world's
[20:48.820 --> 20:49.620]  going.
[20:49.620 --> 20:50.700]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[20:50.700 --> 20:53.260]  Let me just calmly give you a synopsis
[20:53.260 --> 20:55.380]  kind of the back of the book.
[20:55.380 --> 20:57.820]  And then if you'd like to delve into the reality,
[20:57.820 --> 20:58.620]  it goes very deep.
[21:01.700 --> 21:03.540]  You ever heard the term too big to fail?
[21:03.540 --> 21:04.260]  I'm sure you have.
[21:04.260 --> 21:05.540]  How about too evil to fail?
[21:09.060 --> 21:10.300]  Too out of control to fail.
[21:13.140 --> 21:16.740]  I know the names and the players and the statements
[21:16.740 --> 21:20.020]  of the robber baron billionaires 100 years ago.
[21:20.020 --> 21:21.940]  That was like trillionaires today.
[21:21.940 --> 21:25.540]  And the foundations they set up, Colesprings Harbor,
[21:25.540 --> 21:29.060]  Rockefeller Foundation, Bellamel and the Gates Foundation,
[21:29.060 --> 21:35.220]  Kaiser-Villhelm Institute, that from over 120 years ago
[21:35.220 --> 21:39.220]  until now openly have the mission of eugenics.
[21:39.220 --> 21:42.060]  They just don't say it publicly.
[21:42.060 --> 21:44.780]  James Watson, the discoverer of DNA,
[21:44.780 --> 21:47.620]  the guy that ran Colesprings Harbor till a few years ago
[21:47.620 --> 21:51.060]  when he said black people weren't humans.
[21:51.060 --> 21:52.820]  And he said that they can genetically find out
[21:52.820 --> 21:55.140]  who's going to be gay and kill the embryos.
[21:55.140 --> 21:55.780]  I'm not kidding.
[21:58.580 --> 22:02.620]  His only problem was he actually told you what there
[22:02.620 --> 22:03.980]  he's the head dude.
[22:03.980 --> 22:05.380]  That's Bill Gates' mentor.
[22:05.380 --> 22:06.100]  Go look it up.
[22:06.100 --> 22:09.700]  Bill Gates' dad worked for him.
[22:09.700 --> 22:13.740]  And see, I research all this.
[22:13.740 --> 22:15.900]  But the New York Times won't give you his background
[22:15.900 --> 22:17.340]  or who he worked with or who he did.
[22:17.340 --> 22:19.660]  They'll just go, oh, he's one crazy guy that ran
[22:19.660 --> 22:21.300]  the human genome project.
[22:21.300 --> 22:23.860]  He's got a 220 IQ.
[22:23.860 --> 22:25.860]  But he's psychotic.
[22:25.860 --> 22:27.980]  The dude doesn't know how to have a good time.
[22:27.980 --> 22:29.340]  Doesn't know how to have a soul.
[22:29.340 --> 22:31.740]  A lot of these super IQ people are like robots, man.
[22:31.740 --> 22:32.820]  They can do math all day.
[22:32.820 --> 22:37.820]  But brother, they sure won't go change the baby's diaper
[22:37.820 --> 22:41.140]  because IQ was created by these psychotics.
[22:41.140 --> 22:42.180]  And it's not a real reflection.
[22:42.180 --> 22:44.100]  But I'm not going to get into that.
[22:44.100 --> 22:45.780]  Let me explain something here, folks.
[22:45.780 --> 22:48.060]  If you'll think Hitler was bad, you're
[22:48.060 --> 22:50.260]  going to love the COVID-19 response.
[22:50.260 --> 22:52.740]  World government, forced inoculations,
[22:52.740 --> 22:56.340]  implantable vaccine inks that are chips that are liquid
[22:56.340 --> 22:59.860]  so you can never pull the chip out of you.
[22:59.860 --> 23:01.340]  That's ID 2020.
[23:01.340 --> 23:04.820]  That's publicly all over the news right now.
[23:04.820 --> 23:06.140]  My phone rings off the hook.
[23:06.140 --> 23:07.100]  I get calls at home.
[23:07.100 --> 23:09.620]  Neighbors come over and go, I thought you were crazy.
[23:09.620 --> 23:11.060]  They're on the news saying everybody's
[23:11.060 --> 23:13.140]  going to get a digital chip injected into that scene
[23:13.140 --> 23:16.580]  before we can leave our houses.
[23:16.580 --> 23:18.260]  Well, what do we do?
[23:18.260 --> 23:20.540]  They're dragging people off buses that don't have masks on
[23:20.540 --> 23:23.220]  in Philadelphia.
[23:23.220 --> 23:25.220]  Look, I'll do it next segment.
[23:25.220 --> 23:27.500]  I'm going to control myself and actually lay it out.
[23:27.500 --> 23:34.860]  But you understand that I'm not even that smart.
[23:34.860 --> 23:37.740]  I have friends that like football or baseball
[23:37.740 --> 23:41.300]  who can tell me what Babe Ruth did at the third World
[23:41.300 --> 23:46.140]  Series he was at and what type of cigars he smoked.
[23:46.140 --> 23:48.820]  And they can tell me what Darryl Strawberry
[23:48.820 --> 23:52.020]  did at the World Series, all this stuff.
[23:52.020 --> 23:52.660]  Well, you know what?
[23:52.660 --> 23:58.340]  I can tell you how Bill Gates went on PBS in 1990
[23:58.340 --> 24:00.500]  and pledged to set up world government and reduce
[24:00.500 --> 24:02.060]  the world population forcibly.
[24:02.060 --> 24:04.220]  And I got the damn video.
[24:04.220 --> 24:06.060]  And see, all these people go, well,
[24:06.060 --> 24:07.820]  when they mean to pleat the world population,
[24:07.820 --> 24:11.220]  it means we'll just kill off the Mexicans and the black people.
[24:11.220 --> 24:12.540]  Oh, yeah, right.
[24:12.540 --> 24:17.220]  They're going to kill everybody off dumbasses.
[24:17.220 --> 24:20.020]  These people are psychotics.
[24:20.020 --> 24:22.060]  And I sit here and, yeah, I'm going a little crazy
[24:22.060 --> 24:26.980]  knowing all this because I know all these men that
[24:26.980 --> 24:29.540]  are smart and are strong, but they're not spiritually strong.
[24:29.540 --> 24:31.900]  And they all they care about is their house and their trophy
[24:31.900 --> 24:34.140]  wife and their sports car.
[24:34.140 --> 24:36.820]  And they go, Alex, you're dumb.
[24:36.820 --> 24:38.420]  You'll never help the masses.
[24:38.420 --> 24:39.980]  Why don't you just worry about yourself
[24:39.980 --> 24:41.420]  and work in the system?
[24:41.420 --> 24:42.700]  They all think they're part of it.
[24:42.700 --> 24:47.060]  Dude, they're getting rid of that for everybody, dumbass.
[24:47.060 --> 24:50.460]  The globalists hate responsive, smart, empowered people
[24:50.460 --> 24:52.940]  more than they hate the Stooges.
[24:52.940 --> 24:56.700]  They're just trying to get you signed on to extermination
[24:56.700 --> 25:02.140]  so there'll be no one left when it's your time, dumbass.
[25:02.140 --> 25:06.980]  And if you had any spiritual IQ, you'd know that.
[25:06.980 --> 25:09.660]  Why do we have so much wealth and power in this country?
[25:09.660 --> 25:10.900]  Because we were Christian.
[25:10.900 --> 25:12.340]  We realized we were doing wrong.
[25:12.340 --> 25:13.300]  We stood up against it.
[25:13.300 --> 25:14.100]  We reproved it.
[25:14.100 --> 25:14.980]  We did better.
[25:14.980 --> 25:16.620]  We opened up human freedom.
[25:16.620 --> 25:19.820]  We said the common people deserve just as big a chance
[25:19.820 --> 25:22.420]  as royalty because royalty was stagnant.
[25:22.420 --> 25:24.100]  And you talk about retarded.
[25:24.100 --> 25:28.420]  And because we tried to empower the individual and the low IQ,
[25:28.420 --> 25:33.420]  we had all the inventions and took the planet over.
[25:33.420 --> 25:35.500]  But see, this is just an indictment of the globalists
[25:35.500 --> 25:39.100]  and getting in the philosophy of it and how it's wrong.
[25:39.100 --> 25:40.340]  Do I get the howling mob?
[25:40.340 --> 25:42.700]  Can be dumbed down and mobilized to come take my rights?
[25:42.700 --> 25:45.140]  Damn right.
[25:45.140 --> 25:48.220]  But does that mean I want to poison them and dumb them down
[25:48.220 --> 25:51.020]  so I can phase them out and kill them?
[25:51.020 --> 25:53.300]  If you had any spiritual connection to the universe,
[25:53.300 --> 25:57.860]  you'd know God doesn't like that.
[25:57.860 --> 25:59.620]  So it's not only that I don't have a desire
[25:59.620 --> 26:04.300]  to kill people that aren't, on average, as smart as me.
[26:04.300 --> 26:07.100]  I have a desire to empower them because God's
[26:07.100 --> 26:08.380]  a lot smarter than us.
[26:08.380 --> 26:10.020]  But God wants us to learn and teach.
[26:10.020 --> 26:12.220]  It's like your five-year-old doesn't know as much as you.
[26:12.220 --> 26:13.100]  So what do you do?
[26:13.100 --> 26:14.580]  Trip them and beat them up.
[26:14.580 --> 26:16.540]  When you take your five-year-old back in the backyard
[26:16.540 --> 26:18.100]  because you're bigger, you weigh 250 pounds,
[26:18.100 --> 26:19.300]  you can beat them up, you feel big.
[26:19.300 --> 26:21.500]  Oh, look, I can take these poor people to screw them over.
[26:21.500 --> 26:22.420]  I'm real big.
[26:22.420 --> 26:23.900]  I'm survival the fittest, man.
[26:23.900 --> 26:24.700]  I'm real tough.
[26:24.700 --> 26:26.260]  I'm in charge.
[26:26.260 --> 26:28.780]  You're not in charge of nothing.
[26:28.780 --> 26:29.980]  All right, I'm going to stop.
[26:29.980 --> 26:32.220]  And I'm going to take a break.
[26:32.220 --> 26:34.860]  When we come back, I just want to say this.
[26:34.860 --> 26:36.140]  I don't want to be dramatic.
[26:36.140 --> 26:40.660]  There's not, if I knew in a warehouse next door
[26:40.660 --> 26:42.340]  that criminals had kidnapped a little girl
[26:42.340 --> 26:44.780]  and were raping her right now, I would go,
[26:44.780 --> 26:46.340]  tear the door down if I didn't have a key,
[26:46.340 --> 26:48.260]  and I'd go in there and I'd kill them.
[26:48.260 --> 26:49.900]  And not because I'm some special person.
[26:49.900 --> 26:50.540]  I'm a man.
[26:50.540 --> 26:52.140]  I'm programmed right, man.
[26:52.140 --> 26:53.340]  I got it together.
[26:53.340 --> 26:54.340]  I'm not a slave.
[26:54.340 --> 26:55.380]  I don't back down.
[26:55.380 --> 26:56.780]  And how is that even heroic?
[26:56.780 --> 26:58.980]  It's not.
[26:58.980 --> 27:02.100]  So when I get up here and I talk about how they produced
[27:02.100 --> 27:04.540]  this weapon to release it, to take all our freedoms,
[27:04.540 --> 27:05.780]  and they've been caught red-handed,
[27:05.780 --> 27:08.260]  and the very people in the Obama administration
[27:08.260 --> 27:11.100]  that gave it to the chai comms have been caught red-handed
[27:11.100 --> 27:14.620]  and are being blackmailed by the chai comms right now.
[27:14.620 --> 27:16.460]  And I'm risking my life to do this
[27:16.460 --> 27:18.620]  because I'm not a selfish idiot.
[27:18.620 --> 27:20.860]  We're going to lose everything if we don't stand up.
[27:20.860 --> 27:22.620]  I get pissed.
[27:22.620 --> 27:25.420]  Because if your neighbor's house was on fire,
[27:25.420 --> 27:27.900]  and you came to your, say, son's,
[27:27.900 --> 27:30.820]  son, I see the neighbor's house a half mile away on fire.
[27:30.820 --> 27:32.220]  We got to go help them.
[27:32.220 --> 27:34.540]  We said, dad, we don't care.
[27:34.540 --> 27:36.740]  You as a father would be pissed at your son's,
[27:36.740 --> 27:38.460]  not getting up to go help the neighbor.
[27:40.860 --> 27:42.700]  But let's say you went to help the neighbor,
[27:42.700 --> 27:44.860]  and when you get there, you don't have enough help
[27:44.860 --> 27:46.420]  to get the people out and they die.
[27:46.420 --> 27:48.180]  How would you feel towards your son's?
[27:48.180 --> 27:50.500]  You would disown them.
[27:50.500 --> 27:52.820]  And not because you hate them,
[27:52.820 --> 27:56.420]  but because they're not really your son's, they're trash.
[27:56.420 --> 27:58.420]  And God is looking at us and asking,
[27:58.420 --> 28:00.820]  are you going to stand up for people,
[28:00.820 --> 28:04.060]  or are you going to play this devil game of playing God?
[28:04.060 --> 28:06.100]  And I've got James Watson,
[28:06.100 --> 28:09.220]  the guy that advised and ran Bill Gates's dad,
[28:09.220 --> 28:12.180]  everything, literally saying there is no God,
[28:12.180 --> 28:15.740]  but I am God, and I am going to kill the dumb people.
[28:15.740 --> 28:19.180]  And like, he runs it all still, and it's all funny.
[28:19.180 --> 28:20.940]  It's all cutesy cake.
[28:22.060 --> 28:24.940]  So when we come back, what if the Chinese came out
[28:24.940 --> 28:26.380]  and admitted they released the virus?
[28:26.380 --> 28:27.700]  Well, they did.
[28:27.700 --> 28:29.580]  But they said America told us to do it.
[28:29.580 --> 28:31.980]  That's what's broken in the document they released.
[28:31.980 --> 28:34.380]  And of course, I told you, I told the crew before in life,
[28:34.380 --> 28:35.700]  I said, watch this.
[28:35.700 --> 28:36.700]  I said, they've messed up.
[28:36.700 --> 28:38.860]  MI6 messed up when they got this document.
[28:38.860 --> 28:40.380]  It's an attack on America.
[28:40.380 --> 28:42.620]  Watch this, watch this, watch this.
[28:42.620 --> 28:45.740]  And sure enough, they changed the headline.
[28:45.740 --> 28:48.180]  They changed it while we were there watching it in a lifetime.
[28:48.180 --> 28:49.180]  Wait till you hear this.
[28:49.180 --> 28:50.500]  This is the smoking gun.
[28:50.500 --> 28:52.180]  Tell everyone you know, tune in now.
[28:52.180 --> 29:15.260]  This is the smoking gun.
[29:15.260 --> 29:28.580]  It's a fact.
[29:28.580 --> 29:32.340]  Well, now YouTube has admitted to the BBC and others
[29:32.340 --> 29:35.260]  that they're banning anyone criticizing 5G.
[29:35.260 --> 29:37.660]  Even if you don't connect it to coronavirus,
[29:37.660 --> 29:38.620]  they're banning it.
[29:38.620 --> 29:42.060]  But the studies do show that 5G lowers your immunity
[29:42.060 --> 29:43.500]  to viruses, period.
[29:43.500 --> 29:45.340]  They're peer-reviewed journals.
[29:45.340 --> 29:47.540]  We're showing these documents on air.
[29:47.540 --> 29:49.260]  And the globalists can go to hell.
[29:49.260 --> 29:52.500]  The human rebellion against globalist machines has begun.
[29:52.500 --> 29:54.740]  We're not troglodytes afraid of technology.
[29:54.740 --> 29:56.540]  We don't like technology with Trojan
[29:56.540 --> 30:00.900]  Horace anti-human crap in it.
[30:00.900 --> 30:04.340]  What are champions made of?
[30:04.340 --> 30:05.580]  Here's a man who can show you.
[30:05.580 --> 30:10.780]  Trouble 83533139
[30:11.700 --> 30:16.780]  Trouble 87533139
[30:16.780 --> 30:18.820]  It's the inf過去 that man tr발
[30:18.820 --> 30:23.980]  Trouble 87533139
[30:23.980 --> 30:25.260]  It's the inf過去 that man trовать
[30:25.260 --> 30:26.900]  Trouble 82533139
[30:26.900 --> 30:28.420]  It's the inf過去 that man
[30:28.420 --> 30:30.140]  Trouble 83533139
[30:30.140 --> 30:31.380]  It's the inf過去 that one
[30:31.380 --> 30:32.260]  Fray!
[30:32.260 --> 30:33.540]  Trouble 82533139
[30:33.540 --> 30:35.540]  It's the inf�過去 that man
[30:35.540 --> 31:03.920]  When it comes to regaming energy during the day convenience is key.
[31:03.920 --> 31:09.680]  Sure, coffee, candy, and other highly sugar-filled drinks can give you a short boost, but the
[31:09.680 --> 31:12.200]  crash always follows.
[31:12.200 --> 31:18.680]  That's why we created a mixable energy formula to take on the go when you need a little help.
[31:18.680 --> 31:19.680]  Turbo Force.
[31:19.680 --> 31:26.080]  Similar to other mix-in energy packets, Turbo Force from Infowars Life utilizes vitamins,

[31:33.160 --> 31:36.360]  clarity, and a boost of energy when you need it.
[31:36.360 --> 31:43.440]  Turbo Force is certainly a force to be reckoned with for portable, affordable, and tasty energy.

[32:39.320 --> 32:41.800]  body support.
[32:41.800 --> 32:46.640]  We worked hard to create a formula that takes advantage of the power of turmeric.

[32:53.480 --> 33:21.320]  can add to your daily routine.
[33:23.480 --> 33:47.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here back live, so let me lay out some of the most important
[33:47.440 --> 33:53.160]  news and information you're ever going to hear.
[33:53.160 --> 34:13.400]  Let's skip to what's currently happening and then work backwards from there, that's
[34:13.400 --> 34:17.400]  a good way to break this down.
[34:17.400 --> 34:22.560]  Currently all over the control corporate news, we're being told China's Yixi Ping did a wonderful
[34:22.560 --> 34:27.640]  job in China and that Trump did a terrible job.
[34:27.640 --> 34:29.680]  Here's MSN today.
[34:29.680 --> 34:37.000]  He could have seen what was coming behind Trump's failure on the virus.
[34:37.000 --> 34:40.800]  That is being said everywhere.
[34:40.800 --> 34:45.160]  Now let's go back 10 weeks ago to Infowars and bio weapons experts and others we were
[34:45.160 --> 34:53.080]  having on and major Indian universities and German universities that scan the virus and
[34:53.080 --> 35:00.920]  said, this is clearly manmade, we see the gene insertions, this is a chimera.
[35:00.920 --> 35:11.720]  I'm going to show you all those articles.
[35:11.720 --> 35:18.520]  What are you going to do if you're the communist Chinese and a bio weapon gets out of a laboratory
[35:18.520 --> 35:22.720]  and that information is breaking, well, you're going to come up the story that it came from
[35:22.720 --> 35:33.120]  a food market down the street and from bats there, I'm going to go to rebroadcast.
[35:33.120 --> 35:34.600]  I'm going to have to take a break.
[35:34.600 --> 35:37.080]  This is not a new dramatic thing I'm doing here on here.
[35:37.080 --> 35:39.720]  This information is too powerful to even cover on there.
[35:39.720 --> 35:49.000]  It's just too big and I have Dr. Francis Boyle joining us next hour, but you know, it's just
[35:49.000 --> 35:50.000]  too huge.
[35:50.000 --> 35:53.800]  The problem is it's not taken seriously, none of this is taken seriously.
[35:53.800 --> 36:01.800]  People don't even get what they're seeing or hearing because it's what's going to come
[36:01.800 --> 36:07.320]  out of this and what's going to be done to your family and the world government, the
[36:07.320 --> 36:15.400]  forced inoculations and the tyranny and the very people behind it from the Obama administration
[36:15.400 --> 36:21.720]  publicly gave the weaponized viruses to China who further weaponized it and then released
[36:21.720 --> 36:26.360]  it to shut down the Taiwan protest and released it to them be exported against America.
[36:26.360 --> 36:28.720]  So the left would call for a shutdown of our economy.
[36:28.720 --> 36:31.920]  So if Trump doesn't do that, he's a mass murderer.
[36:31.920 --> 36:38.520]  So we go into depression, they remove Trump from office and then when it starts coming
[36:38.520 --> 36:46.560]  out that our own scientists know it's manmade and you can't say it came out of some food
[36:46.560 --> 36:49.680]  market, you go, oh yeah.
[36:49.680 --> 36:58.840]  And the Chinese government releases a document on info wars.com saying they got it from the
[36:58.840 --> 37:07.720]  U.S. government and indeed it came out of the Wuhan laboratory.
[37:07.720 --> 37:14.560]  So now the Chinese are letting America know if you try to blame us and you let Trump blame
[37:14.560 --> 37:22.840]  us, we're going to expose Fauci and Gates and the universities who we have the names
[37:22.840 --> 37:28.120]  of who gave us all of this, who did this and of course Gates and Fauci did it.
[37:28.120 --> 37:29.600]  They're the ones getting the power from it.
[37:29.600 --> 37:31.600]  They're the ones that have the event 201 drills.
[37:31.600 --> 37:32.960]  They're the ones that set it all up.
[37:32.960 --> 37:44.040]  So I'm going to air a special report and I'm going to come back and try it in one segment
[37:44.040 --> 37:45.040]  as a compendium.
[37:45.040 --> 37:48.160]  We're not going to put articles on screen.
[37:48.160 --> 37:52.680]  It's not the Cruz fault but what happens is I'm here and they want to put up on screen
[37:52.680 --> 37:53.680]  things I'm talking about.
[37:53.680 --> 37:56.000]  I've already got them all right here.
[37:56.000 --> 38:01.680]  And then my mind is already projected ready to lay all this out how it all connects.
[38:01.680 --> 38:04.480]  And I'm giving a briefing here and it's not their fault for doing a great job.
[38:04.480 --> 38:05.480]  I should just go home actually.
[38:05.480 --> 38:06.480]  That's probably what I'm going to do.
[38:06.480 --> 38:07.480]  It's no big deal.
[38:07.480 --> 38:11.680]  At this point if America wants to screw it man, screw it.
[38:11.680 --> 38:13.080]  You want Gates's vaccines.
[38:13.080 --> 38:14.720]  You want robot control.
[38:14.720 --> 38:15.880]  They're publicly doing it.
[38:15.880 --> 38:16.880]  No one cares.
[38:16.880 --> 38:18.960]  Nobody cares about the unborn babies.
[38:18.960 --> 38:21.280]  Just screw it man.
[38:21.280 --> 38:29.520]  That's so unbelievable at this point.
[38:29.520 --> 38:32.520]  You know the good news is at least all this is starting to come out.
[38:32.520 --> 38:36.360]  All right I'm going to give you a clip to play.
[38:36.360 --> 38:37.360]  Hopefully it's on the computer.
[38:37.360 --> 38:41.720]  But let's look at these.
[38:41.720 --> 38:43.200]  Greg Races reports really good.
[38:43.200 --> 38:44.600]  Medical tyranny 2020.
[38:44.600 --> 38:47.040]  Let's get that clip, clip four ready.
[38:47.040 --> 38:51.920]  We're going to air that here in right now.
[38:51.920 --> 38:59.080]  You know having been through other serious issues particularly the very painful early
[38:59.080 --> 39:05.480]  years of HIV AIDS when people talk about conspiracy theories.
[39:05.480 --> 39:12.880]  You will always have conspiracy theories when you have very challenging public health crises.
[39:12.880 --> 39:14.680]  They are nothing but distractions.
[39:14.680 --> 39:15.880]  You know I can assure you.
[39:15.880 --> 39:22.160]  We have so much to do to protect the health and the welfare of the American people that
[39:22.160 --> 39:27.440]  I would just hope we just put those conspiracy stuff and let somebody write a book about
[39:27.440 --> 39:28.440]  it later on.
[39:28.440 --> 39:29.440]  But not now.
[39:29.440 --> 39:37.080]  Anthony Fauci does not like conspiracy theories and if the president does not fire several
[39:37.080 --> 39:43.280]  members of his COVID-19 response team the books written in the future will likely be
[39:43.280 --> 39:47.640]  about the Bill Gates big pharma takeover of America.
[39:47.640 --> 39:55.040]  Dr. Fauci is on the leadership council for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[39:55.040 --> 40:01.560]  Deborah Birx is a board member for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria
[40:01.560 --> 40:06.000]  which was founded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[40:06.000 --> 40:12.200]  Robert Redfield, current director of the CDC was a founder of the Institute of Human
[40:12.200 --> 40:20.520]  Virology who has received $31.8 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[40:20.520 --> 40:26.680]  Seema Verna has worked with Sue Desmond Helman, chief executive officer of the Bill and Melinda
[40:26.680 --> 40:29.120]  Gates Foundation.
[40:29.120 --> 40:34.640]  Alex Azar was president of Eli Lilly's U.S. division.
[40:34.640 --> 40:40.200]  Under his leadership prices for the company's top selling insulin drug tripled which led
[40:40.200 --> 40:43.360]  to a class action lawsuit.
[40:43.360 --> 40:48.560]  Jerome Adams received a medical scholarship from Eli Lilly.
[40:48.560 --> 40:56.280]  Stephen Hahn is commissioner for the FDA, partnered with Bill and Melinda Gates in 2017.
[40:56.280 --> 41:02.360]  Stephen Mnuchin was a member of Skolin Bones at Yale University and he partnered with George
[41:02.360 --> 41:06.800]  Soros to create SFM Capital Management.
[41:06.800 --> 41:15.680]  Brett Geror was the director of DARPA and CDC official Dr. Nancy Messonnier is Rod Rosenstein's
[41:15.680 --> 41:17.600]  sister.
[41:17.600 --> 41:22.400]  Many have been concerned that President Trump has been surrounded by deep state operatives
[41:22.400 --> 41:24.640]  for the past three years.
[41:24.640 --> 41:31.360]  Well now he seems to be completely surrounded by big pharma and Bill Gates loyalists.
[41:31.360 --> 41:37.520]  While pushing vaccines as the solution and admitting that they might make things worse.
[41:37.520 --> 41:39.920]  Does the vaccine make you worse?
[41:39.920 --> 41:43.280]  And there are diseases in which you vaccinate someone.
[41:43.280 --> 41:47.880]  They get infected with what you're trying to protect them with and you actually enhance
[41:47.880 --> 41:49.960]  the infection.
[41:49.960 --> 41:54.080]  Los Angeles has announced that they're going to pay people to snitch on their neighbors.
[41:54.080 --> 42:00.280]  I know the old expression about snitches, well in this case snitches get rewards.
[42:00.280 --> 42:05.200]  We want to thank you for turning folks in and making sure we are all safe.
[42:05.200 --> 42:11.320]  And the public is now being prepared for mandatory certificates of immunity in order to freely
[42:11.320 --> 42:12.720]  leave their homes.
[42:12.720 --> 42:18.920]  Can you imagine a time where Americans carry certificates of immunity?
[42:18.920 --> 42:20.920]  You know that's possible.
[42:20.920 --> 42:21.920]  That's a plenimal chance.
[42:21.920 --> 42:26.520]  You know those things that we talk about when we want to make sure that we know who the
[42:26.520 --> 42:30.720]  vulnerable people are and not this is something that's being discussed.
[42:30.720 --> 42:37.000]  I think it might actually be have some merit on the certain circumstances.
[42:37.000 --> 42:40.920]  Welcome to Medical Tyranny 2020.
[42:40.920 --> 42:43.360]  For info wars dot com this is Greg Reese.
[42:43.360 --> 42:45.360]  May God be with you all.
[42:45.360 --> 42:50.280]  When we come back I'm knocking out of the park in one segment I'm laying the entire thing
[42:50.280 --> 42:51.280]  out.
[42:51.280 --> 42:55.840]  China has now come out and said the US gave them COVID-19.
[42:55.840 --> 42:59.120]  That's blackmail.
[42:59.120 --> 43:05.760]  When one studies history and human nature you learn very quickly that rugged individualism
[43:05.760 --> 43:11.560]  and people to think for themselves, build free societies, innovate to amazing things.
[43:11.560 --> 43:17.160]  But those that love to grovel, those that love to be subservient, those that love to
[43:17.160 --> 43:23.400]  comply and think that it's a virtue, they create stagnation, corruption, tyranny and
[43:23.400 --> 43:29.240]  then finally collapse and the world is now being tested.
[43:29.240 --> 43:34.240]  Remember seeing lots of dutiful individuals who've complied and submitted their whole
[43:34.240 --> 43:40.200]  lives believing if they just submit now in a bigger way somehow they'll create a heavenly
[43:40.200 --> 43:41.200]  future.
[43:41.200 --> 43:49.920]  But the technocrats running the global system are oppressive and anti-human and are psychotic
[43:49.920 --> 43:52.640]  and are building an anti-human future.
[43:52.640 --> 44:01.080]  And to them is like tying a big boulder on your neck and throwing it in the ocean.
[44:01.080 --> 44:07.600]  What are champions made of?
[44:07.600 --> 44:14.320]  Here's a man who can show you.
[44:14.320 --> 44:19.320]  Triple eight, two-five, three-three-one, three-nine, triple eight, two-five, three-three-one, three-nine,
[44:19.320 --> 44:22.320]  triple eight, two-five, three-three-nine, triple eight, two-five, three-three-one, three-nine,
[44:22.320 --> 44:26.340]  is the Info or Store hotline
[44:26.340 --> 44:30.340]  tripa 8 to 5, 3, 4, 3, 9
[44:30.340 --> 44:34.340]  is the Info or Store hotline
[44:34.360 --> 44:38.340]  tripa 8 to 5, 3, 4, 3, 9
[44:38.340 --> 44:42.340]  is the Info or Store hotline
[44:42.340 --> 44:46.340]  tripa 8 to 5, 3, 4, 3, 9
[44:46.340 --> 44:50.180]  is the Info or Store hotline
[44:50.180 --> 44:58.780]  That's InfoWars, store.com.
[44:58.780 --> 45:04.260]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[45:04.260 --> 45:09.540]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[45:09.540 --> 45:16.300]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[45:16.300 --> 45:22.140]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[45:22.140 --> 45:25.460]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[45:25.460 --> 45:30.100]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[45:30.100 --> 45:35.460]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[45:35.460 --> 45:36.460]  symptoms.
[45:36.460 --> 45:39.140]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[45:39.140 --> 45:40.380]  It is not an antihistamine.
[45:40.380 --> 45:45.020]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[45:45.020 --> 45:50.820]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[45:50.820 --> 45:53.460]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[45:53.460 --> 45:59.380]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[45:59.380 --> 46:06.300]  The ultimate tyranny would be a nanny state that would not allow anyone to ever do anything
[46:06.300 --> 46:10.020]  that could possibly hurt them, and that's the globalist plan.
[46:10.020 --> 46:12.580]  And now, Mr. Fauci at the NIH.
[46:12.580 --> 46:16.700]  Last night in a press conference standing right next to the president said, we're going
[46:16.700 --> 46:22.580]  to have a global lockdown, because he talked to world leaders, until not one more person
[46:22.580 --> 46:26.900]  is dying or one more person is infected.
[46:26.900 --> 46:29.460]  The video is posted on InfoWars.com.
[46:29.460 --> 46:34.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, that sets the precedent where not one person can die from the flu,
[46:34.300 --> 46:36.820]  not one person can die from a cold.
[46:36.820 --> 46:41.620]  Everyone will be surveilled in live time by their cell phones and apps and drones and
[46:41.620 --> 46:45.220]  an absolute straight jacket of pure medical tyranny.
[46:45.220 --> 46:49.420]  And remember, it's a big pharma that has on the level four bioweapons labs that keeps
[46:49.420 --> 46:52.020]  leaking all these man-made viruses.
[46:52.020 --> 46:53.620]  They're holding us all hostage.
[46:53.620 --> 47:01.940]  Oh, Annie talked about forced denotations.
[47:01.940 --> 47:19.060]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:19.060 --> 47:27.420]  It's Sunday, April 12th, the year is 2020, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[47:27.420 --> 47:37.540]  An article appeared last night in the Daily Mail with a press release, documents put
[47:37.540 --> 47:45.180]  up with the Communist Chinese saying that, okay, we were working with COVID-19 type viruses
[47:45.180 --> 47:50.780]  with bats at the Wuhan level four bioweapons facility, but don't blame us.
[47:50.780 --> 47:51.780]  We didn't do it on purpose.
[47:51.780 --> 47:59.380]  We're not sure how it happened, but Obama and the NIH and Fauci starting in 2012 gave
[47:59.380 --> 48:02.380]  us all these grants and all this money to do it.
[48:02.380 --> 48:03.540]  Now why would they do that?
[48:03.540 --> 48:05.580]  Because they know that we're exposing them.
[48:05.580 --> 48:09.500]  They know major institutes have scanned the viruses and know that it's man-made.
[48:09.500 --> 48:12.540]  It's not just from some cave.
[48:12.540 --> 48:17.020]  And they know that they then cultured it inside piglets that were fed dead piglets that were
[48:17.020 --> 48:21.980]  killed with the virus so that they could then harvest the virus in mass, weaponize it and
[48:21.980 --> 48:22.980]  produce it.
[48:22.980 --> 48:28.020]  And then right when Taiwan rebelled, right when China was about to be overthrown by people
[48:28.020 --> 48:33.020]  resisting it, right when the globalists couldn't get rid of Trump, the very globalists that
[48:33.020 --> 48:39.500]  gave China the weaponized COVID-19 Wuhan virus, the very globalists that set China up, very
[48:39.500 --> 48:43.420]  globalists who wanted to remove Trump, told GDP, you release it, it will shut down Taiwan,
[48:43.420 --> 48:45.380]  it will shut down your own people.
[48:45.380 --> 48:48.620]  We'll then say you did a great job, reopen your economy, we'll then launch it into the
[48:48.620 --> 48:49.620]  West.
[48:49.620 --> 48:50.620]  Trump will never know what's hitting.
[48:50.620 --> 48:53.220]  We'll tell them that Trump's got too strong a response at first.
[48:53.220 --> 48:55.860]  He'll relax the response, judges will block him.
[48:55.860 --> 49:00.900]  Once it hits the United States, we will then blame him for every death and say he must
[49:00.900 --> 49:04.580]  be removed from office and it'll kill the economy, the things supporting him.
[49:04.580 --> 49:05.900]  That's what happened.
[49:05.900 --> 49:08.660]  We said that nine months ago is what the evidence showed.
[49:08.660 --> 49:12.380]  Had top experts like Dr. Boyle, who wrote the U.S. Biological Weapons Law, joining us
[49:12.380 --> 49:13.380]  next hour.
[49:13.380 --> 49:16.180]  Then we have articles and documents and scientific research.
[49:16.180 --> 49:23.340]  I'll show you right now where this was going on five years ago and was a national debate.
[49:23.340 --> 49:29.100]  Only three years after it started, scientists were like, why are you giving gain of function,
[49:29.100 --> 49:35.260]  meaning airborne, weaponized, common cold to the Chinese, a chimera virus that you can
[49:35.260 --> 49:38.980]  add viruses onto, a cutout virus.
[49:38.980 --> 49:39.980]  China can't produce that.
[49:39.980 --> 49:41.740]  At least they couldn't five years ago.
[49:41.740 --> 49:45.700]  The U.S. government gave them that virus that they could then load anything they wanted
[49:45.700 --> 49:50.980]  into and they loaded the Wuhan virus into it because it's a coronavirus and so is that
[49:50.980 --> 49:51.980]  virus.
[49:51.980 --> 49:55.940]  I will show you mainline news five years ago saying, what are you doing giving China gain
[49:55.940 --> 49:57.980]  of function?
[49:57.980 --> 50:03.740]  So China's saying to the NIH, to the deep state, to the globalist, hey, you're going to hang
[50:03.740 --> 50:08.300]  us out to drive for the virus you gave us, you're going to let Trump come out with Senator
[50:08.300 --> 50:13.940]  Cotton and Senator Holly and Alex Jones and Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson
[50:13.940 --> 50:19.100]  and even Bill Maher comes out and says, if China did this on purpose, it's war Friday
[50:19.100 --> 50:20.100]  night.
[50:20.100 --> 50:23.900]  As America wakes up to this and says, yeah, it's an economic weapon and yeah, you covered
[50:23.900 --> 50:28.420]  it up and yeah, it came out of your laboratory, they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold
[50:28.420 --> 50:31.020]  your horses there, Tex.
[50:31.020 --> 50:35.740]  Here's the documents we were given this in all these studies by Obama and by Fauci and
[50:35.740 --> 50:36.740]  the NIH.
[50:36.740 --> 50:41.580]  You've got Bill Gates and the globalist and all the money in the Rockefeller Foundation
[50:41.580 --> 50:48.780]  that did lockstep 10 years ago, a big public paper about world government martial law using
[50:48.780 --> 50:52.220]  a deadly airborne virus that hits the lungs.
[50:52.220 --> 50:57.900]  You've got event 201 last year conducted by Bill and the Gates, 65 million die from an
[50:57.900 --> 51:02.420]  airborne coronavirus and they bring in world government, they tabletopped and exercised
[51:02.420 --> 51:06.580]  all this and then Bill Gates has all the shows come out about him as a hero during a pandemic
[51:06.580 --> 51:13.700]  and Bill Gates has the, not the vaccine ready, but the actual clone of this virus, this
[51:13.700 --> 51:17.420]  master virus ready two years ago.
[51:17.420 --> 51:18.420]  He's got that.
[51:18.420 --> 51:19.420]  This is all come out.
[51:19.420 --> 51:22.940]  But now he's the savior everywhere saying, you don't leave your house till you've had
[51:22.940 --> 51:23.940]  the shot.
[51:23.940 --> 51:28.220]  You'll have to have a digital tattoo in the vaccine under your skin for you to go to school.
[51:28.220 --> 51:29.220]  That's ABC News.
[51:29.220 --> 51:31.340]  Children will have to have this to go to school.
[51:31.340 --> 51:35.140]  This isn't Alex Jones' warning of it saying it'd be Bill Gates later in a release bio
[51:35.140 --> 51:37.980]  but it's been done.
[51:37.980 --> 51:42.780]  But I knew that if we exposed that the Chai comms released it to shut down Taiwan, shut
[51:42.780 --> 51:46.900]  down their own people, had been promised by the World Health Organization, the UN, that
[51:46.900 --> 51:51.580]  they'd be seen as heroes, but the Trump would then be blamed as the bad guy.
[51:51.580 --> 51:52.580]  G.G.
[51:52.580 --> 51:59.180]  Ping went for it, allowed its release, allowed incubation in Wuhan and then the Democrats
[51:59.180 --> 52:02.340]  said, leave the borders open, leave the planes open, go to Chinatown.
[52:02.340 --> 52:06.260]  The federal judges tried to block Trump for a few weeks, blocking the flights eight, nine
[52:06.260 --> 52:07.260]  weeks ago.
[52:07.260 --> 52:11.020]  They got in, it incubated NIH, brought in Americans that had it, turned them loose in
[52:11.020 --> 52:16.420]  San Antonio, turned them loose in New York, turned them loose in Seattle, L.A., Portland.
[52:16.420 --> 52:17.420]  This is all on record.
[52:17.420 --> 52:19.940]  I'm watching all this, seeing it.
[52:19.940 --> 52:23.100]  And then suddenly they go from Trump, don't stop it, there's no problem, the virus is
[52:23.100 --> 52:24.100]  a hoax too.
[52:24.100 --> 52:25.100]  It's your fault, Trump.
[52:25.100 --> 52:26.100]  You didn't do enough.
[52:26.100 --> 52:29.620]  Once they knew there was enough people here to have some death.
[52:29.620 --> 52:30.620]  And there it is.
[52:30.620 --> 52:32.980]  Oh, Wuhan's not involved.
[52:32.980 --> 52:35.980]  Oh, they're level four bioweapons labs not involved.
[52:35.980 --> 52:41.300]  Oh, never mind Alex Jones and, you know, the top weapons experts he has on saying five
[52:41.300 --> 52:46.620]  years ago Obama transferred this to them and eight years ago did the contracts.
[52:46.620 --> 52:47.980]  We've already exposed all this.
[52:47.980 --> 52:54.620]  I've already had Dr. Boyle on and others six, seven, eight, nine weeks ago over and over
[52:54.620 --> 52:59.900]  again saying it's a gain of function bioweapon released out of Wuhan.
[52:59.900 --> 53:07.140]  Videos with millions of views at Band-Aut Video.
[53:07.140 --> 53:11.460]  And then the Communist Chinese desperately released a document toward the biggest papers
[53:11.460 --> 53:14.900]  in the world, the Daily Mail.
[53:14.900 --> 53:19.660]  And the headline earlier was, oh, they tested on bats with COVID-19 and they're not sure
[53:19.660 --> 53:23.300]  that's where, and I said that's, they don't get the hit piece while the Chinese did this.
[53:23.300 --> 53:26.900]  It's to blame America and the blackmail, the West saying you released this will expose
[53:26.900 --> 53:30.460]  your deep state operatives at NIH that gave it to us and sure enough, they changed the
[53:30.460 --> 53:35.300]  headline saying America scandal gave the bioweapon to them.
[53:35.300 --> 53:37.180]  It's all America's fault.
[53:37.180 --> 53:38.180]  Wow.
[53:38.180 --> 53:40.460]  I mean, this is so epic.
[53:40.460 --> 53:44.020]  And then in live time, they're changing the article and removing what it said earlier
[53:44.020 --> 53:47.420]  about the NIH and Fauci transferring it to them.
[53:47.420 --> 53:53.180]  But we have it all saved at a place called infowars.com.
[53:53.180 --> 53:57.820]  Wuhan lab was performing experiments on bats from coronavirus caves, but now they've changed
[53:57.820 --> 54:01.500]  the headline to say it's America's fault.
[54:01.500 --> 54:02.500]  Here's our article.
[54:02.500 --> 54:08.340]  Global bombshell, China admits to harvesting and testing COVID-19 like coronavirus at Wuhan
[54:08.340 --> 54:13.100]  lab and even admit COVID-19 specifically, but our article lays it all out even as the
[54:13.100 --> 54:19.380]  screenshots of how the Daily Mail has now changed their headline and removed stuff.
[54:19.380 --> 54:24.500]  Wuhan lab was performing coronavirus experiments on bats from the caves where the disease is
[54:24.500 --> 54:29.660]  believed to have originated with a 3 million pound grant from the U.S.
[54:29.660 --> 54:31.260]  That has now been completely changed.
[54:31.260 --> 54:35.060]  Go ahead if you want to put the new headline up.
[54:35.060 --> 54:39.860]  Now there it is, revealed U.S. government gave 3.7 million grant to Wuhan lab at Center
[54:39.860 --> 54:43.540]  of Coronavirus League Security that was performing experiments on bats from caves where the disease
[54:43.540 --> 54:44.900]  is believed to have originated.
[54:44.900 --> 54:46.420]  Now why are they doing all this?
[54:46.420 --> 54:48.820]  Because yes, it came out of Wuhan.
[54:48.820 --> 54:50.260]  Yes, it came out of the lab.
[54:50.260 --> 54:53.980]  Yes, Obama and the globalists funded this so China could release it on their enemies
[54:53.980 --> 54:58.100]  later and use this economic weapon against America and have the martial law locked down
[54:58.100 --> 55:01.300]  the forced inoculation.
[55:01.300 --> 55:05.380]  But when you read the headline, it didn't come from the bats.
[55:05.380 --> 55:10.060]  It came from the United States of America and the globalists and Obama and Fauci running
[55:10.060 --> 55:11.060]  it.
[55:11.060 --> 55:16.020]  Here is TheScientist.com article from five years ago I keep harping on.
[55:16.020 --> 55:23.860]  Lab made coronavirus triggers debate and it goes on to say the gain of function is what
[55:23.860 --> 55:24.860]  worries them.
[55:24.860 --> 55:28.140]  They've even gone and tried to edit this and pull stuff out, but it's on the way back machine
[55:28.140 --> 55:29.140]  saved.
[55:29.140 --> 55:33.580]  Why would you give them an airborne weaponized chimera genetically engineered from four viruses
[55:33.580 --> 55:34.620]  to China?
[55:34.620 --> 55:39.980]  Because it's the carrier they need to then splice viruses with it, inject it into piglets
[55:39.980 --> 55:44.260]  who then die and they take the dead piglet meat, feed it to other piglets, then they
[55:44.260 --> 55:49.660]  drain the blood out of those piglets and strain out all the viruses.
[55:49.660 --> 55:53.260]  By the way, you can go read the Chinese government report, they admit all this, but they say
[55:53.260 --> 55:57.660]  America told us, Obama told us, Fauci told us and they're saying, hey, you get Trump
[55:57.660 --> 55:58.820]  off our ass.
[55:58.820 --> 56:00.500]  We did all this for you.
[56:00.500 --> 56:01.500]  You gave it to us.
[56:01.500 --> 56:06.660]  And then of course it was all pointed at America, though, when Trump got in and the economy
[56:06.660 --> 56:07.660]  and everything else.
[56:07.660 --> 56:12.340]  Oh, GZ pinged at a great job a month ago, America's done a bad job, China can reopen,
[56:12.340 --> 56:15.740]  we can ever reopen because here's the key to everything.
[56:15.740 --> 56:21.020]  If President Trump gets out and says communist China working with traders in America, Hollywood
[56:21.020 --> 56:25.300]  and the EU globalists have launched this whole attack on us economically, they're pissed
[56:25.300 --> 56:28.780]  this happened, they hid how bad it was, bare minimum, they came out of their lab and they
[56:28.780 --> 56:31.580]  released it on purpose or by accident, it doesn't matter.
[56:31.580 --> 56:35.940]  And damn right, Fauci and the NIH and Obama are involved in all this too.
[56:35.940 --> 56:38.340]  We're shutting down these level four bio weapons labs.
[56:38.340 --> 56:40.740]  We're going to prosecute the people that have been involved.
[56:40.740 --> 56:45.700]  We're going to shut all this down and this is over, then it's the right thing to do.
[56:45.700 --> 56:47.140]  The economy comes back.
[56:47.140 --> 56:51.700]  People aren't mind controlled by this by the very group, Fauci, that works for Soros and
[56:51.700 --> 56:56.540]  for Bill Gates and others can't use it to terrorize us and control us because they're
[56:56.540 --> 57:04.220]  the very ones that are behind it all like James Bond, supervillains, next level clearly
[57:04.220 --> 57:09.340]  having the motive, the history and now their fingerprints all over it caught red handed
[57:09.340 --> 57:13.540]  because now there's infighting between the chai comms and the deep state in America to
[57:13.540 --> 57:15.100]  try to take down Trump.
[57:15.100 --> 57:18.660]  Trump can now expose this, it's all coming out in the open and the chai comms are having
[57:18.660 --> 57:22.180]  to admit that they're the ones that actually bred this up but are saying, hey you told
[57:22.180 --> 57:26.940]  us to do it, it doesn't matter, we now expose Fauci, Bill Gates, the globalist, Hillary
[57:26.940 --> 57:30.660]  Clinton, Obama for doing it and it's game over for them because that's what I told you
[57:30.660 --> 57:36.780]  nine weeks ago this is and that's what this is and that's why this is so damn incredible.
[57:36.780 --> 57:42.260]  I mean Trump has total checkmate victory in his hands and it's the right thing to do but
[57:42.260 --> 57:48.420]  it's going to be scary to come out and that Obama has to be arrested for treason immediately.
[57:48.420 --> 57:53.300]  This ad will only run for a couple days because it's about to sell out, I notice, hey we had
[57:53.300 --> 57:57.540]  a lot of prostagard, people love it, we've got a lot of it, why is it suddenly almost
[57:57.540 --> 57:58.540]  sold out?
[57:58.540 --> 58:02.860]  And I went, oh my gosh it's an incredible formula not just for the prostate, the solpal
[58:02.860 --> 58:08.740]  meadow that's on record for helping that, it's got everything, vitamin D, a big dose
[58:08.740 --> 58:13.300]  of that, a big dose of zinc, a big dose of selenium, copper, chromium and a bunch of
[58:13.300 --> 58:19.700]  other stuff, this is the perfect formula for what's going on right now and it's about
[58:19.700 --> 58:23.740]  to sell out at infowarstore.com and I want you to have it so that after all this craziness
[58:23.740 --> 58:27.980]  passes it becomes a normal regimen in your life because this is something in my view
[58:27.980 --> 58:28.980]  you need every day.
[58:28.980 --> 58:35.500]  Get it right now, prostagard at infowarstore.com and whatever you do please warn others that
[58:35.500 --> 58:40.620]  Mother Nature has given us a lot of things that really help boost our overall health
[58:40.620 --> 58:48.620]  and wellness.
[58:48.620 --> 58:52.700]  I don't need to remind you how four years ago I told you the polls against Trump were
[58:52.700 --> 58:53.700]  fake.
[58:53.700 --> 58:58.860]  He was winning by a giant margin but election fraud almost stole the election from Trump
[58:58.860 --> 58:59.860]  and the American people.
[58:59.860 --> 59:06.540]  Well now they're pushing the idea that oh cancel the Republican and Democrat conventions,
[59:06.540 --> 59:11.420]  maybe cancel the election a year like the Olympics, that's because they know Trump
[59:11.420 --> 59:17.900]  in every internal scientific poll is 20 points ahead of the brain damage bite.
[59:17.900 --> 59:22.860]  So they can say sir you look big like the Olympics, go back off a year and then you'll
[59:22.860 --> 59:25.580]  still win in a year after you fix the crisis, no.
[59:25.580 --> 59:30.580]  They need more time to cook up an assassination, an economic collapse, a new virus.
[59:30.580 --> 59:34.940]  Trump needs to say no in America we keep elections on time, have the elections, win
[59:34.940 --> 59:38.460]  by a landslide and not give the globalists what they want.
[59:38.460 --> 59:42.940]  Hillary, Biden, they all want to suspend the election, we shouldn't give them what
[59:42.940 --> 59:43.940]  they want.
[59:43.940 --> 59:51.980]  We need to have a vote in America and reelect Trump 2020.
[59:51.980 --> 1:00:05.300]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:05.300 --> 1:00:09.260]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, I'm your host Alex Jones and the biggest news ever
[1:00:09.260 --> 1:00:14.900]  when it comes to COVID-19, the martial law and everything we're seeing has now broken.
[1:00:14.900 --> 1:00:21.020]  The Communist Chinese came out in a reversal yesterday and released a document saying okay
[1:00:21.020 --> 1:00:27.540]  we were working with bats in COVID-19 under a U.S. government grant in Wuhan going back
[1:00:27.540 --> 1:00:35.940]  starting in 2012, ending in 2017, the NIH and Fauci was directing us.
[1:00:35.940 --> 1:00:40.220]  Now they've said this isn't man made even though major institutions and universities
[1:00:40.220 --> 1:00:45.700]  have scanned the virus and said that it is so huge now they're being forced to say that
[1:00:45.700 --> 1:00:48.460]  because they know the evidence is mounting that that's the case.
[1:00:48.460 --> 1:00:55.380]  So now they're saying hey, Obama and Hillary and big tech and Bill and Linda Gates, they
[1:00:55.380 --> 1:01:00.020]  gave us these viruses, they did all of this.
[1:01:00.020 --> 1:01:04.700]  So if you want to blame China and talk about war with China, well it's your fault, it's
[1:01:04.700 --> 1:01:06.180]  your deep state did it.
[1:01:06.180 --> 1:01:10.340]  Meanwhile, mainstream media is blaming Trump for any deaths and saying he should be driven
[1:01:10.340 --> 1:01:11.980]  from office.
[1:01:11.980 --> 1:01:16.460]  So Wuhan lab was performing experiments on bats from coronavirus caves.
[1:01:16.460 --> 1:01:17.460]  We already knew this.
[1:01:17.460 --> 1:01:20.540]  China was already in the literature.
[1:01:20.540 --> 1:01:27.580]  But what's crazy is now China is admitting all of this because they know that the Senate
[1:01:27.580 --> 1:01:32.180]  Intelligence Committee and others know what's happening and that Trump is getting ready
[1:01:32.180 --> 1:01:38.460]  to blame China for doing this because they did it in conjunction with the globalist deep
[1:01:38.460 --> 1:01:43.060]  state to have these weapons and clearly when Taiwan was revolting, China was revolting,
[1:01:43.060 --> 1:01:47.460]  Xi Jinping was in trouble, this was a weapon against our economy, the Commies would shut
[1:01:47.460 --> 1:01:51.260]  it down, cover it up, the media would praise them, the UN they own would praise them, but
[1:01:51.260 --> 1:01:54.940]  the same lapdog media for the Commies that attacked America and Trump.
[1:01:54.940 --> 1:01:58.620]  Everything we predicted nine weeks ago was now unfolded, but now the Chai comms have come
[1:01:58.620 --> 1:02:05.940]  out and said watch out, blaming us, your deep state, Fauci, the NIH at all, it's in the article,
[1:02:05.940 --> 1:02:09.220]  they may pull it any time, but we've saved it, posted in our article, they've already
[1:02:09.220 --> 1:02:12.540]  changed the headline, already pulling some of the stuff.
[1:02:12.540 --> 1:02:19.460]  And this is a major shot across the bow from the Chai comms saying hey, you blame us, you
[1:02:19.460 --> 1:02:24.100]  pull us into this, hey, you gave it to us, you said we should do it.
[1:02:24.100 --> 1:02:28.060]  Well, Trump didn't do that, the deep state traders did, so instead of Trump just sitting
[1:02:28.060 --> 1:02:31.940]  there and taking this and then going search national security, you go no, it's criminals
[1:02:31.940 --> 1:02:32.940]  in our government.
[1:02:32.940 --> 1:02:36.060]  We've already arrested the head scientist at Harvard involved in this, we've already
[1:02:36.060 --> 1:02:39.620]  arrested thousands of Chinese agents, we're going to just bring this out in front of
[1:02:39.620 --> 1:02:43.620]  America and explain the Democratic Party, Hollywood's owned by the Chai comms.
[1:02:43.620 --> 1:02:47.500]  They use the Chai comms to set this up, they use communist China to carry out their crimes
[1:02:47.500 --> 1:02:51.260]  along with their money, and now they've been caught red-handed, because they're not going
[1:02:51.260 --> 1:02:55.620]  to give up, just like when the impeachment didn't work, they launched this bio attack.
[1:02:55.620 --> 1:02:57.340]  And now it's an attack against the economy.
[1:02:57.340 --> 1:03:01.780]  You cannot sit there and take these attacks anymore, and that's my advice to the president,
[1:03:01.780 --> 1:03:06.100]  the American people, to the Pentagon, is that we're already in a war, everybody already
[1:03:06.100 --> 1:03:10.060]  knows it, and let's just get honest about where we are.
[1:03:10.060 --> 1:03:14.100]  But to have the Chai comms come out and say, we were given this by America, we were paid
[1:03:14.100 --> 1:03:19.140]  to do this by America, okay, it's in our lab that we were told to do it by you, is public
[1:03:19.140 --> 1:03:20.580]  blackmail.
[1:03:20.580 --> 1:03:25.620]  The article's global bomb show, China admits to harvesting and testing COVID-19 like coronavirus
[1:03:25.620 --> 1:03:32.860]  is a woo on lab, under Barack Obama's directive, boy, they don't want that getting out of them.
[1:03:32.860 --> 1:03:37.980]  This article was five years ago, lab-made coronavirus triggers debate, they even changed
[1:03:37.980 --> 1:03:42.100]  that headline a month ago when we first started covering it a few months ago, it said, gain
[1:03:42.100 --> 1:03:48.260]  of function, man-made chimera, why, but it's on the way back machine, why did North Carolina
[1:03:48.260 --> 1:03:52.740]  level four under Obama's directive give them a weaponized coronavirus that's airborne
[1:03:52.740 --> 1:03:54.020]  and kills people?
[1:03:54.020 --> 1:03:58.820]  It doesn't matter if the scientist changes the headline, we have the scientists in the
[1:03:58.820 --> 1:03:59.820]  reports.
[1:03:59.820 --> 1:04:04.260]  Look at this one, coronavirus contains HIV insertions, stoking fears of artificially
[1:04:04.260 --> 1:04:08.980]  created by a weapon, the Indian university has been vindicated and now the Indian government
[1:04:08.980 --> 1:04:15.260]  last week announced criminal investigation of the woo on lab because the Indian government's
[1:04:15.260 --> 1:04:19.460]  got scientists as good as anybody, they've scanned it and they say it's man-made with
[1:04:19.460 --> 1:04:26.780]  the P Shuttle gene insertions, German labs, Indian labs, others who aren't afraid early
[1:04:26.780 --> 1:04:29.060]  on said, my God, this is totally man-made.
[1:04:29.060 --> 1:04:35.020]  It was man-made in the U.S. as a carrier virus, they brought it over, spliced it, then bred
[1:04:35.020 --> 1:04:41.740]  it in piglets that were fed dead piglets that had died from being injected with COVID-19.
[1:04:41.740 --> 1:04:47.340]  Unbelievable, the author of the U.S. biological weapons law became world treaty, Dr. Francis
[1:04:47.340 --> 1:04:52.300]  Boyle in 60 seconds, tell folks to tune in or roll over and die to the globalists, this
[1:04:52.300 --> 1:04:57.460]  is a major giant development.
[1:04:57.460 --> 1:05:02.940]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes
[1:05:02.940 --> 1:05:08.460]  and full verses of your paying attention, you know we've done together, but I'll tell
[1:05:08.460 --> 1:05:15.860]  you this, the technocrats are really upping their game and they're trying to destroy all
[1:05:15.860 --> 1:05:20.540]  independent forms of media, they're trying to shudder and silence the human resistance,
[1:05:20.540 --> 1:05:26.020]  so now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate
[1:05:26.020 --> 1:05:29.460]  and everything you warned your friends and family about us around to be true, so it's
[1:05:29.460 --> 1:05:34.900]  now that your credibility is way up, the power structures are to silence those of us that
[1:05:34.900 --> 1:05:42.220]  they can't, but it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us, we have the power,
[1:05:42.220 --> 1:05:48.180]  but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech, we have to make sure that
[1:05:48.180 --> 1:05:52.860]  we fight hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come, so be in
[1:05:52.860 --> 1:06:03.860]  the power of yours you are.
[1:06:03.860 --> 1:06:12.860]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:12.860 --> 1:06:18.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide, I am your host Alex Jones and you can go
[1:06:18.580 --> 1:06:23.740]  back to band.video, go back to infowars.com, newswars.com starting about nine weeks ago,
[1:06:23.740 --> 1:06:28.780]  who began to have Dr. Francis Boyle on every week, he normally comes on three or four times
[1:06:28.780 --> 1:06:33.520]  a year and he's got multiple degrees from Harvard, represents world leaders at The
[1:06:33.520 --> 1:06:37.860]  Hague, wrote the U.S. Biological Weapons Law that got adopted most evident in the World
[1:06:37.860 --> 1:06:41.820]  Treaty and he came on nine weeks ago, in fact a minute I'll put up on screen for you, I'll
[1:06:41.820 --> 1:06:45.980]  put up on my phone, it's pretty quick, and he came on nine weeks ago, there's one of
[1:06:45.980 --> 1:06:50.620]  February 21st, he came on even before that and said, smoking gun bombshell interview
[1:06:50.620 --> 1:06:59.940]  Professor Francis Boyle exposes the bioweapons origin of the COVID-19 coronavirus, and again
[1:06:59.940 --> 1:07:04.580]  he came on three weeks before that too, but great job crew pulling that up with ten seconds
[1:07:04.580 --> 1:07:07.740]  because they just, this isn't a pre-planned show, they're just going off what I'm covering
[1:07:07.740 --> 1:07:10.260]  because I've done my own research.
[1:07:10.260 --> 1:07:16.860]  When I got up this morning at like 6 a.m. and I went to drugsreport.com, I went to m4s.com
[1:07:16.860 --> 1:07:22.380]  and I saw the Daily Mail, that's basically British intelligence, with the headline, China
[1:07:22.380 --> 1:07:27.980]  admits that they were taking blood from bats and injecting it into piglets and isolating
[1:07:27.980 --> 1:07:35.940]  hundreds of new coronaviruses including COVID-19, it just absolutely blew me away, since then
[1:07:35.940 --> 1:07:41.140]  they've changed the headline to blind America, which is what I predicted they would do.
[1:07:41.140 --> 1:07:45.260]  What do you do when the NIH, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, these big globalist
[1:07:45.260 --> 1:07:51.380]  weaponized systems are giving China these systems on record that Boyle exposed going
[1:07:51.380 --> 1:07:57.340]  back eight, nine weeks ago here on air, what do you do when that's happening?
[1:07:57.340 --> 1:08:03.220]  Well, you come out and you say, okay, we were given grants by the NIH to do this, just as
[1:08:03.220 --> 1:08:07.700]  Boyle said months ago, so don't blame us.
[1:08:07.700 --> 1:08:12.820]  So now they've gone on from saying, oh, nothing's going on at the lab, we never looked at anything
[1:08:12.820 --> 1:08:16.740]  as illogical, we don't look at bats, somebody ate a bat down the street, that's what caused
[1:08:16.740 --> 1:08:21.940]  it, to okay, you're right, probably leaked out of our lab or whatever, the U.S. government
[1:08:21.940 --> 1:08:28.020]  told us to do this, because see, we weren't supposed to be that smart.
[1:08:28.020 --> 1:08:32.340]  Boyle was the first to say it, it's just true that it's in the literature, in the sign of
[1:08:32.340 --> 1:08:35.580]  express that there was a scandal five years ago, that this had been going on for three
[1:08:35.580 --> 1:08:38.940]  years then, now eight years.
[1:08:38.940 --> 1:08:46.060]  And this is so huge, because from what I see politically, forget the science, is that China
[1:08:46.060 --> 1:08:50.420]  now knows people are getting pissed that they leaked this, they had this, so they know that
[1:08:50.420 --> 1:08:54.860]  they're getting the blame, even Bill Mars says this might be war Friday.
[1:08:54.860 --> 1:08:57.860]  And so they're going, oh, guess what, we were getting this from you.
[1:08:57.860 --> 1:09:01.780]  So they've gone from denying it and covering it up and going, okay, we did this, but think
[1:09:01.780 --> 1:09:07.060]  about, forget the chicoms, Fauci, $100 million grant from Bill and Luna Gates, Bill and
[1:09:07.060 --> 1:09:11.700]  Luna Gates with their event 201 for global martial law, Bill Gates once injectable force
[1:09:11.700 --> 1:09:16.740]  inoculations under the skin microchips, all this craziness, everything he's ever wanted,
[1:09:16.740 --> 1:09:21.540]  when meanwhile he's behind the scenes of this whole thing, this is so bombshell, and yeah,
[1:09:21.540 --> 1:09:29.820]  we'll play a clip next segment where Fauci said in 2017, Trump will be faced with a giant
[1:09:29.820 --> 1:09:32.060]  biological event.
[1:09:32.060 --> 1:09:33.060]  Well now it's here.
[1:09:33.060 --> 1:09:36.940]  So we're told our way of life is over and all these things are going to happen, but
[1:09:36.940 --> 1:09:41.860]  the very people involved in it from the beginning, illegal weapons research, using China as the
[1:09:41.860 --> 1:09:47.860]  place to conduct gain of function, which was in the news that this was wrong, a major scandal.
[1:09:47.860 --> 1:09:49.340]  And what's their answer?
[1:09:49.340 --> 1:09:52.860]  They've gone in and edited the Daily Mail, they've gone in and edited the scientist and
[1:09:52.860 --> 1:09:58.940]  remove the headline that was major controversy, chimera, lab made cell gain of function, because
[1:09:58.940 --> 1:10:03.180]  the literature said they did it, they weren't hiding it.
[1:10:03.180 --> 1:10:06.540]  Now they've just changed the headline.
[1:10:06.540 --> 1:10:11.300]  Creation of come erasars like viruses, scientists discussing the risk of gain of function research.
[1:10:11.300 --> 1:10:17.500]  So joining us for the rest of the hour is Dr. Boyle, in fact, I never go over his whole
[1:10:17.500 --> 1:10:18.500]  bio.
[1:10:18.500 --> 1:10:23.500]  Maybe I should sometimes we want to hear somebody's credentials, but it would take about an hour.
[1:10:23.500 --> 1:10:26.660]  But he's headed up international organizations.
[1:10:26.660 --> 1:10:31.620]  He's represented world leaders, presidential presidents, prime ministers at the Hague.
[1:10:31.620 --> 1:10:33.580]  He wrote the U.S. Biological Weapons Law.
[1:10:33.580 --> 1:10:36.260]  He's delivered the Bertrand Russell Peace Lectures.
[1:10:36.260 --> 1:10:39.460]  He's a best-selling author, the whole nine yards, and he's here with us.
[1:10:39.460 --> 1:10:45.100]  But for me, this is a seismic event to have China go from denying it, Dr. Boyle, to going,
[1:10:45.100 --> 1:10:51.660]  yeah, we did it and you told us to, I mean, what in the hell is going on here?
[1:10:51.660 --> 1:10:52.660]  Thank you for having me.
[1:10:52.660 --> 1:10:58.980]  Alex, my best year viewing audience and Happy Easter pass over to those of you who observe
[1:10:58.980 --> 1:10:59.980]  these holidays.
[1:10:59.980 --> 1:11:07.460]  Well, right now, Alex, what seriously concerns me is this.
[1:11:07.460 --> 1:11:18.220]  Has there been anyone to sit down with President Trump and explain to him that this is an extremely
[1:11:18.220 --> 1:11:29.300]  dangerous, offensive, biological warfare weapon that has never been unleashed upon humanity
[1:11:29.300 --> 1:11:30.300]  before?
[1:11:30.300 --> 1:11:40.100]  It has now been reported that U.S. intelligence agencies figured out there was a leak of something
[1:11:40.100 --> 1:11:50.140]  there from the BSL-4 by the end of November and apparently put it in daily intelligence
[1:11:50.140 --> 1:11:55.220]  reports or something like that, which as we know, President Trump doesn't pay much attention
[1:11:55.220 --> 1:12:00.940]  to because for good cause, he doesn't trust U.S. intelligence agencies.
[1:12:00.940 --> 1:12:06.660]  But they figured it out on the basis of their own intelligence sources.
[1:12:06.660 --> 1:12:08.940]  Our intelligence agencies are dumb.
[1:12:08.940 --> 1:12:11.940]  They might be correct, corrupt, but they're not dumb.
[1:12:11.940 --> 1:12:16.340]  And that's why we pay tens of billions of dollars to work over there.
[1:12:16.340 --> 1:12:24.060]  And according to the report, the first Trump ever heard was by Alex Azar up to his eyeballs
[1:12:24.060 --> 1:12:28.380]  in the drug industry on January 3rd.
[1:12:28.380 --> 1:12:36.820]  Well, did anyone ever tell President Trump what I said here before, an extremely dangerous
[1:12:36.820 --> 1:12:43.740]  offensive, biological warfare weapon that threatens all of humanity?
[1:12:43.740 --> 1:12:50.700]  I don't get the impression that anyone has told them that because the cast of characters
[1:12:50.700 --> 1:12:57.420]  he has around him, excluding President, sorry, Vice President Pence, are up to their eyeballs
[1:12:57.420 --> 1:12:59.460]  in this stuff.
[1:12:59.460 --> 1:13:05.340]  And they're not going to complain because eventually, as you correctly pointed out,
[1:13:05.340 --> 1:13:07.660]  the trail leads back to them.
[1:13:07.660 --> 1:13:13.340]  Well, I correctly pointed that out because you've harped on that in like 15 shows.
[1:13:13.340 --> 1:13:14.780]  I mean, you nailed it.
[1:13:14.780 --> 1:13:16.500]  You showed the original documents.
[1:13:16.500 --> 1:13:17.500]  It's now confirmed.
[1:13:17.500 --> 1:13:21.020]  I want to get into what this means when we come back, but Dr. Boyle, how big is it?
[1:13:21.020 --> 1:13:22.020]  Do you agree with my analysis?
[1:13:22.020 --> 1:13:23.020]  And maybe I'm wrong.
[1:13:23.020 --> 1:13:24.020]  Correct me if I'm wrong.
[1:13:24.020 --> 1:13:25.020]  You're the expert.
[1:13:25.020 --> 1:13:27.820]  China coming out and saying, okay, it came out of our lab probably, but you paid us to
[1:13:27.820 --> 1:13:28.820]  do it.
[1:13:28.820 --> 1:13:32.300]  That's them trying to get out of this and shows they're now trying to blackmail Fauci
[1:13:32.300 --> 1:13:37.300]  in the NIH like to suppress Trump and because Trump's going in the direction of blaming China
[1:13:37.300 --> 1:13:39.460]  and China's like, wait, wait, don't be so quick.
[1:13:39.460 --> 1:13:41.180]  You're involved with your eyeballs.
[1:13:41.180 --> 1:13:42.180]  Right.
[1:13:42.180 --> 1:13:49.340]  Well, you know, during the Watergate scandal, this is all the limited hangout by China.
[1:13:49.340 --> 1:14:01.820]  As I said before, it's clear China was weaponizing this Wuhan coronavirus to be used at some
[1:14:01.820 --> 1:14:04.340]  point in the future.
[1:14:04.340 --> 1:14:07.740]  There's not a doubt in my mind that was going on.
[1:14:07.740 --> 1:14:16.460]  But it is also clear from the record that they got this technology courtesy of the different
[1:14:16.460 --> 1:14:25.500]  agencies of the United States government that you have discussed, including the FDA, Harvard's
[1:14:25.500 --> 1:14:35.020]  Bayna-Farber Cancer Center, University of North Carolina, Fauci's NIAID, and the National
[1:14:35.020 --> 1:14:36.780]  Institute of Health.
[1:14:36.780 --> 1:14:40.820]  And this all occurred under the Obama administration.
[1:14:40.820 --> 1:14:46.660]  As I said before, Trump is left holding the bag here.
[1:14:46.660 --> 1:14:55.940]  And he, I think, has to face up to the fact that we here in America are in the war of
[1:14:55.940 --> 1:15:02.380]  our lives in order to save our own people and our own country.
[1:15:02.380 --> 1:15:07.980]  I think he's got to be honest with the people, the American people, explain what happened
[1:15:07.980 --> 1:15:08.980]  here.
[1:15:08.980 --> 1:15:11.900]  You know, I'm not a China basher.
[1:15:11.900 --> 1:15:15.340]  As I said before, I'm a professor of international law.
[1:15:15.340 --> 1:15:20.180]  They can have whatever government they want over there, but it is undeniable what happened
[1:15:20.180 --> 1:15:21.180]  here.
[1:15:21.180 --> 1:15:28.860]  The Chinese, the Chinese government at the very top from President Xi on down, as demonstrated
[1:15:28.860 --> 1:15:37.500]  by the cover-up, knew that they were weaponizing this coronavirus and undoubtedly for use against
[1:15:37.500 --> 1:15:39.980]  us someday.
[1:15:39.980 --> 1:15:45.460]  We have to start with that and work forward from it.
[1:15:45.460 --> 1:15:46.460]  Well, exactly.
[1:15:46.460 --> 1:15:47.460]  That's why I was going to get you on.
[1:15:47.460 --> 1:15:48.460]  Stay there.
[1:15:48.460 --> 1:15:49.460]  We're going to break.
[1:15:49.460 --> 1:15:50.460]  But I get a headache with all the evidence where to start.
[1:15:50.460 --> 1:15:53.580]  First, you just started what the solution is, what Trump needs to do right now.
[1:15:53.580 --> 1:15:54.580]  We'll be right back.
[1:15:54.580 --> 1:15:55.580]  What are champions made of?
[1:15:55.580 --> 1:15:56.580]  Here's a man who can show you.
[1:15:56.580 --> 1:16:14.060]  Triple-eight, two-five, three-three, one-three-nine.
[1:16:14.060 --> 1:16:15.660]  Triple-eight, two-five, three-three, one-three-nine...
[1:16:15.660 --> 1:16:17.540]  Is the info-or-store hotline...
[1:16:17.540 --> 1:16:20.740]  Triple-eight, two-five, three-three, one-three-nine.
[1:16:20.740 --> 1:16:22.980]  Triple-eight, two-five, three-three, one-three-nine.
[1:16:22.980 --> 1:16:25.980]  Triple-eight, two-five, three-three, one-three-nine.
[1:16:55.980 --> 1:17:03.340]  As predicted, the human rebellion against globalist machines has begun.
[1:17:03.340 --> 1:17:08.900]  The LA Times, The Washington Post, Wired Magazine all reported years ago that major studies
[1:17:08.900 --> 1:17:13.420]  show 5G caused increased cancer in rats.
[1:17:13.420 --> 1:17:14.420]  It's a fact.
[1:17:14.420 --> 1:17:19.980]  5G is just a later generation of systems that are on record for more than 70 years to cause
[1:17:19.980 --> 1:17:21.100]  cancer.
[1:17:21.100 --> 1:17:24.020]  They rub the DNA molecules together.
[1:17:24.020 --> 1:17:26.580]  They are microwaves.
[1:17:26.580 --> 1:17:32.100]  Well now, YouTube has admitted to the BBC and others that they're banning anyone criticizing
[1:17:32.100 --> 1:17:33.100]  5G.
[1:17:33.100 --> 1:17:36.580]  Even if you don't connect it to coronavirus, they're banning it.
[1:17:36.580 --> 1:17:41.460]  But the studies do show that 5G lowers your immunity to viruses, period.
[1:17:41.460 --> 1:17:43.340]  They're peer-reviewed journals.
[1:17:43.340 --> 1:17:47.220]  We're showing these documents on air, and the globalists can go to hell.
[1:17:47.220 --> 1:17:50.540]  The human rebellion against globalist machines has begun.
[1:17:50.540 --> 1:17:52.740]  We're not troglodytes afraid of technology.
[1:17:52.740 --> 1:17:57.260]  We don't like technology with Trojan Horse anti-human crap in it.
[1:17:57.260 --> 1:17:58.260]  It's Wednesday morning.
[1:17:58.260 --> 1:18:03.220]  I was just in a local Austin business that was basically empty, and there were 3 motorcycle
[1:18:03.220 --> 1:18:04.220]  police in there.
[1:18:04.220 --> 1:18:07.860]  And I said, what do you think of this whole coronavirus thing?
[1:18:07.860 --> 1:18:10.740]  And they're like, ah, it looks like it's a hoax.
[1:18:10.740 --> 1:18:13.300]  And I said, yeah, you're absolutely right.
[1:18:13.300 --> 1:18:16.540]  The way it's been handled is a hoax.
[1:18:16.540 --> 1:18:21.060]  Taking everybody that dies who happens to test positive, even if they die of a heart attack
[1:18:21.060 --> 1:18:25.900]  or cancer or diabetes, as dying from coronavirus is the big one.
[1:18:25.900 --> 1:18:30.340]  And then, of course, they're also classifying everybody that tests positive for coronavirus,
[1:18:30.340 --> 1:18:34.900]  period, not just COVID-19, as having it.
[1:18:34.900 --> 1:18:36.700]  So they're upping a number of cases.
[1:18:36.700 --> 1:18:38.220]  They're upping a number of deaths.
[1:18:38.220 --> 1:18:42.660]  But still, more people died this week and last week than died from the coronavirus from
[1:18:42.660 --> 1:18:43.660]  suicide.
[1:18:43.660 --> 1:18:48.660]  So if anything, it's causing divorces and suicide and stir craziness and basic insanity and
[1:18:48.660 --> 1:18:53.620]  a giant power grab with big pharma preparing a forced inoculation, which they even admit
[1:18:53.620 --> 1:18:57.180]  will not protect you from next year's mutation of the coronavirus.
[1:18:57.180 --> 1:19:02.820]  Do yourself a favor and fund the M4 at the same time.
[1:19:02.820 --> 1:19:08.100]  Go to m4store.com and read about the ingredients, the highest quality, like black walnut and
[1:19:08.100 --> 1:19:11.860]  others that are in this baby, and then read some of those reviews for yourself.
[1:19:11.860 --> 1:19:13.380]  And then don't just believe M4.
[1:19:13.380 --> 1:19:18.500]  Go out online at major nutrition sites and others and look at the studies for yourself.
[1:19:18.500 --> 1:19:22.380]  Go out and engage in your First Amendment right to research and your First Amendment
[1:19:22.380 --> 1:19:27.580]  right to tell others about incredible compounds God has given us through Mother Nature.
[1:19:27.580 --> 1:19:33.020]  Living Defense is at m4store.com, sold out for four months, now back in stock for a limited
[1:19:33.020 --> 1:19:35.420]  time at 40% off.
[1:19:35.420 --> 1:19:40.300]  People are doing their own research and they're getting Living Defense at 40% off at m4store.com.
[1:19:40.300 --> 1:19:44.260]  And we've got our great super blue toothpaste, the best seller for five years with the nano
[1:19:44.260 --> 1:19:49.140]  silver, the tea tree and the iodine, it's selling out still 50% off and the iodine's selling
[1:19:49.140 --> 1:20:02.940]  out the X3, it's 60% off because I want you to experience how amazing it is.
[1:20:02.940 --> 1:20:22.820]  Dr. Francis Boyle, the author of the U.S. biological weapons law, got adopted in the World Treaty.
[1:20:22.820 --> 1:20:28.780]  Just said, this is the greatest threat faced in modern times by America and the world,
[1:20:28.780 --> 1:20:34.420]  an offensive Chinese biological weapon.
[1:20:34.420 --> 1:20:38.060]  Developed the Wuhan Weapons Facility, he said that nine weeks ago, here on air, the articles
[1:20:38.060 --> 1:20:40.060]  posted.
[1:20:40.060 --> 1:20:45.700]  And now the Communist Chinese have come out and said last night in a release that, okay,
[1:20:45.700 --> 1:20:52.220]  we were doing these research labs, it's true, but the NIH funded us, that's what Boyle harped
[1:20:52.220 --> 1:20:58.180]  on so much because once that happens, the chai comms can blackmail us and back and forth.
[1:20:58.180 --> 1:21:01.780]  This is what Fauci had to say in 2017.
[1:21:01.780 --> 1:21:06.860]  Is that there is no question that there will be a challenge to the coming administration
[1:21:06.860 --> 1:21:11.940]  in the arena of infectious diseases, both chronic infectious diseases in the sense of
[1:21:11.940 --> 1:21:17.180]  already ongoing disease and we have certainly a large burden of that, but also there will
[1:21:17.180 --> 1:21:19.180]  be a surprise outbreak.
[1:21:19.180 --> 1:21:24.220]  And he goes on to say that Trump will be challenged by it.
[1:21:24.220 --> 1:21:29.660]  So Dr. Boyle, instead of being excited or in a good mood that we're so right about this,
[1:21:29.660 --> 1:21:31.740]  I'm the most freaked out I've ever been.
[1:21:31.740 --> 1:21:34.300]  The crew knows, and I've been on here 26 years, I never choke.
[1:21:34.300 --> 1:21:38.060]  I'm having trouble doing the show right now because I know how real it is.
[1:21:38.060 --> 1:21:39.580]  I see the lockdown.
[1:21:39.580 --> 1:21:41.820]  I see the thousands dead every day in New York.
[1:21:41.820 --> 1:21:46.460]  I sit there and I watch the media make jokes about this and blame Trump.
[1:21:46.460 --> 1:21:47.460]  Forget Trump.
[1:21:47.460 --> 1:21:49.020]  He's not behind it.
[1:21:49.020 --> 1:21:53.300]  And I see them reveling in it, trying to bring down the economy and calling for vaccines
[1:21:53.300 --> 1:21:56.500]  that you've put out yourself will never match what the mutation is.
[1:21:56.500 --> 1:21:57.780]  So that's worthless.
[1:21:57.780 --> 1:22:01.480]  The British government, the UK government, the Canadian government, I've got a stack
[1:22:01.480 --> 1:22:05.140]  here saying it'll never end until we have a cure.
[1:22:05.140 --> 1:22:09.600]  And I see the very medical tyranny, the Nazi science as you call it, these level four
[1:22:09.600 --> 1:22:15.380]  bio weapons labs that are transferring this all over the world, not getting in trouble,
[1:22:15.380 --> 1:22:17.660]  but actually getting all this power.
[1:22:17.660 --> 1:22:21.420]  And I'm watching Fauci, because I remember like when you were on nine weeks ago going
[1:22:21.420 --> 1:22:24.300]  and Fauci's behind it, he's running since the eighties.
[1:22:24.300 --> 1:22:25.300]  He runs the labs.
[1:22:25.300 --> 1:22:26.300]  He's doing it.
[1:22:26.300 --> 1:22:27.300]  I knew a lot of that was in the news.
[1:22:27.300 --> 1:22:28.300]  Then you could find it.
[1:22:28.300 --> 1:22:29.940]  But I'm thinking really Fauci.
[1:22:29.940 --> 1:22:37.340]  And now the guy on stage I look at who I know then transferred this to China with Obama.
[1:22:37.340 --> 1:22:38.340]  It's a feeling I've never had.
[1:22:38.340 --> 1:22:40.900]  It's not a feeling of fear, a feeling of even anger.
[1:22:40.900 --> 1:22:43.780]  It's more of a feeling of like, how the hell is this happening?
[1:22:43.780 --> 1:22:46.940]  I'm gonna stop just help.
[1:22:46.940 --> 1:22:47.940]  This is so huge.
[1:22:47.940 --> 1:22:49.820]  Let's just get the political here.
[1:22:49.820 --> 1:22:50.820]  Do you agree with me?
[1:22:50.820 --> 1:22:54.700]  I don't want to speculate, but you're a famous lawyer too, not just a guy that research
[1:22:54.700 --> 1:22:56.180]  of science.
[1:22:56.180 --> 1:22:58.340]  What do you make of China coming out and saying this?
[1:22:58.340 --> 1:22:59.980]  Clearly they're saying, don't blame us.
[1:22:59.980 --> 1:23:02.340]  We were being funded to do this research.
[1:23:02.340 --> 1:23:03.340]  Don't blame us.
[1:23:03.340 --> 1:23:04.380]  I mean, that's a pretty big development there.
[1:23:04.380 --> 1:23:06.740]  How else could you read that?
[1:23:06.740 --> 1:23:08.340]  Well, right.
[1:23:08.340 --> 1:23:19.180]  You know, at Nuremberg, the Nazis tried to make the defense known as Tupokoy and Latin.
[1:23:19.180 --> 1:23:26.020]  You also, that, well, we might have committed war crimes, but so did you.
[1:23:26.020 --> 1:23:30.180]  And the Nuremberg Tribunal rejected that defense.
[1:23:30.180 --> 1:23:36.180]  And we were sitting on that Nuremberg Tribunal, it was President Roosevelt's idea.
[1:23:36.180 --> 1:23:41.340]  So I don't think we should accept the Chinese defense here.
[1:23:41.340 --> 1:23:44.340]  And I want to make it clear, I'm not a China basher.
[1:23:44.340 --> 1:23:45.340]  I never have been.
[1:23:45.340 --> 1:23:49.100]  No, no, Nummy, you're well known to be not anti-China, but that's what I'm saying is,
[1:23:49.100 --> 1:23:52.580]  there's that because we know they brought up the eugenics programs in the U.S. and Margaret
[1:23:52.580 --> 1:23:55.820]  Sanger and stuff and then said, so we're allowed to, we're like, well, you actually executed
[1:23:55.820 --> 1:23:56.820]  it.
[1:23:56.820 --> 1:24:00.100]  What I'm getting at here is how big is it that they're coming out saying, hey, don't
[1:24:00.100 --> 1:24:01.100]  blame us.
[1:24:01.100 --> 1:24:02.100]  We were working with Fauci.
[1:24:02.100 --> 1:24:07.020]  I mean, to me, that is that that's showing desperateness right there that the whole operation you
[1:24:07.020 --> 1:24:10.300]  exposed over two months ago here on air is now coming out in the open.
[1:24:10.300 --> 1:24:11.700]  That's got to be vindicated.
[1:24:11.700 --> 1:24:14.380]  Well, I don't feel vindicated.
[1:24:14.380 --> 1:24:22.380]  This seems that the Chinese have moved to the second stage of their propaganda campaign.
[1:24:22.380 --> 1:24:25.540]  The first was to cover it up and lie about it.
[1:24:25.540 --> 1:24:30.820]  And by the way, Fauci knew right away, if U.S. intelligence agencies figured this out
[1:24:30.820 --> 1:24:36.420]  by the end of November, it was pretty easy for Fauci to do.
[1:24:36.420 --> 1:24:39.120]  All he had to do was pull it up on his computer.
[1:24:39.120 --> 1:24:45.700]  It was right there that his NIAID had paid for it at University of North Carolina.
[1:24:45.700 --> 1:24:46.700]  It's there.
[1:24:46.700 --> 1:24:47.860]  You can just read it.
[1:24:47.860 --> 1:24:52.900]  And same with the National Institutes of Health.
[1:24:52.900 --> 1:25:00.260]  It was paused and then it was approved again and reauthorized by the Obama.
[1:25:00.260 --> 1:25:06.260]  So these people knew at the highest level and they tried to cover up everything since
[1:25:06.260 --> 1:25:14.420]  then and not only that, but use it to empower themselves and their own agenda.
[1:25:14.420 --> 1:25:15.420]  You're exactly right.
[1:25:15.420 --> 1:25:21.460]  Well, that's what makes me physically have an emotion beyond anger now.
[1:25:21.460 --> 1:25:25.420]  When I see the people and what you said confirmed, because I believe you and I've had you over
[1:25:25.420 --> 1:25:28.900]  20 something years and I know you're a smart guy and really have integrity, but still I've
[1:25:28.900 --> 1:25:30.340]  taken stuff a little bit of grain of salt.
[1:25:30.340 --> 1:25:32.740]  Okay, well, maybe he's right about all of it.
[1:25:32.740 --> 1:25:37.020]  I now know they're getting all the power, all the control, locking us down in our houses.
[1:25:37.020 --> 1:25:38.020]  They're behind this.
[1:25:38.020 --> 1:25:39.020]  They're covering it up.
[1:25:39.020 --> 1:25:40.500]  The Chai comms are now admitting it.
[1:25:40.500 --> 1:25:41.900]  Plus we have all the documents admitting it.
[1:25:41.900 --> 1:25:43.900]  I don't believe the damn thing the Chai comms say.
[1:25:43.900 --> 1:25:45.700]  To me, it's just surreal, doctor.
[1:25:45.700 --> 1:25:47.700]  It's just like, what's coming next?
[1:25:47.700 --> 1:25:55.340]  Well, so I can say, you know, professionally, I've dealt with major war criminals myself
[1:25:55.340 --> 1:26:01.980]  like Slobodan Milosevic, firstly, Keridic and those types of people.
[1:26:01.980 --> 1:26:08.260]  So it doesn't surprise me at all that we have the exact same type of people here running
[1:26:08.260 --> 1:26:12.220]  the this issue in the United States government.
[1:26:12.220 --> 1:26:18.140]  Right under President Trump snows and vice president, and by the way, for an average person,
[1:26:18.140 --> 1:26:21.180]  I'm going to not interrupt you next segment, but that's kind of sounds like a weird buzz.
[1:26:21.180 --> 1:26:23.460]  You represented at the Hague, Slobodan Milosevic and others.
[1:26:23.460 --> 1:26:26.780]  I mean, for folks that didn't know, I didn't represent Milosevic.
[1:26:26.780 --> 1:26:29.780]  I went after Milosevic for the Bosnian.
[1:26:29.780 --> 1:26:34.020]  That's what I meant, I mean, you went after him, but you meant you represented at the
[1:26:34.020 --> 1:26:41.660]  court trial, right, both at the International Court of Justice in the Hague, starting in
[1:26:41.660 --> 1:26:43.700]  2003.
[1:26:43.700 --> 1:26:53.380]  And then in 1999, I agreed to become the attorney for the mothers of Shrebenica and Padrina.
[1:26:53.380 --> 1:26:55.500]  Yeah, I'm sorry for saying that.
[1:26:55.500 --> 1:26:59.660]  I meant like you were representative at that trial.
[1:26:59.660 --> 1:27:06.140]  I represented them before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia,
[1:27:06.140 --> 1:27:15.220]  and I got Milosevic indicted for almost every crime in the ICTY statute, including two counts
[1:27:15.220 --> 1:27:24.580]  of genocide, one for genocide against Bosnia in general, and the second for Shrebenica,
[1:27:24.580 --> 1:27:25.580]  the genocide.
[1:27:25.580 --> 1:27:30.660]  And I knew that, I said it wrong, that's the perfect foot and mouth statement, but that's
[1:27:30.660 --> 1:27:31.660]  perfect when you're alive.
[1:27:31.660 --> 1:27:32.660]  That happens.
[1:27:32.660 --> 1:27:35.740]  When we come back in a 10-minute segment, what do you want to lay out here?
[1:27:35.740 --> 1:27:39.700]  What are you predicting next happens if the Chinese government's not going, okay, we're
[1:27:39.700 --> 1:27:44.780]  doing experiments for the U.S. government, NIH, leave us alone, don't blame us?
[1:27:44.780 --> 1:27:46.620]  That to me just shows desperation.
[1:27:46.620 --> 1:27:50.020]  You're saying next, you say it's the next level of their propaganda.
[1:27:50.020 --> 1:27:51.020]  Right.
[1:27:51.020 --> 1:27:57.900]  Well, again, I think we have to act irrespective of what they're doing.
[1:27:57.900 --> 1:28:03.280]  They lie, they've lied from the get-go, you are correct.
[1:28:03.280 --> 1:28:09.860]  This is a turbocharged Chinese communist dictatorship over there under President Xi.
[1:28:09.860 --> 1:28:12.900]  So we can't rely on anything coming out of China.
[1:28:12.900 --> 1:28:22.700]  Indeed, this so-called University of Washington program statistics Americans killed, I think
[1:28:22.700 --> 1:28:30.220]  they're relying on Chinese data, they admit it, Berks admits he's relying on Chinese data.
[1:28:30.220 --> 1:28:32.140]  It's completely preposterous.
[1:28:32.140 --> 1:28:38.180]  They're giving us low-ball figures here of future American casualties, and that University
[1:28:38.180 --> 1:28:43.860]  of Washington, that study has been bought and paid for by Bill Gates.
[1:28:43.860 --> 1:28:45.540]  So how can you rely on any of that?
[1:28:45.540 --> 1:28:46.540]  You can't.
[1:28:46.540 --> 1:28:51.420]  You know, we American people are just going to have to take this into our own hands.
[1:28:51.420 --> 1:28:55.220]  But again, I don't know if anyone gives you any...
[1:28:55.220 --> 1:28:56.220]  Stay right there.
[1:28:56.220 --> 1:28:57.220]  Right back.
[1:28:57.220 --> 1:29:00.700]  Since the invention and deployment of radar during World War II, scientists have noted
[1:29:00.700 --> 1:29:06.740]  increased cancers and other health problems with those who were close to the devices.
[1:29:06.740 --> 1:29:08.860]  That's where they're really high-powered.
[1:29:08.860 --> 1:29:13.500]  If you're a quarter mile from a cell tower, there's not any real high-powered radiation
[1:29:13.500 --> 1:29:14.500]  hitting you.
[1:29:14.500 --> 1:29:17.860]  But if you're a couple hundred feet away, they got fences around them with skull and
[1:29:17.860 --> 1:29:19.580]  crossbones on them for a reason.
[1:29:19.580 --> 1:29:21.500]  It says it can hurt you.
[1:29:21.500 --> 1:29:27.620]  So now with 5G that's even stronger, these systems are literally above the streets, just
[1:29:27.620 --> 1:29:32.920]  20 or 30 feet from people's heads, from their genitals, from their bodies.
[1:29:32.920 --> 1:29:36.100]  People are burning them down and attacking them all over the world now.
[1:29:36.100 --> 1:29:38.340]  I'm saying don't do that.
[1:29:38.340 --> 1:29:39.980]  Use information warfare.
[1:29:39.980 --> 1:29:45.580]  Use the truth to expose it and sue local governments and others until they remove them.
[1:29:45.580 --> 1:29:49.380]  That's the way to deal with this, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:29:49.380 --> 1:29:53.740]  Take action in the information war, but I got to tell you, I can't blame the people
[1:29:53.740 --> 1:29:56.900]  that are doing it because they're under assault.
[1:29:56.900 --> 1:29:59.580]  It's incontrovertible.
[1:29:59.580 --> 1:30:01.740]  Humanity is dying.
[1:30:01.740 --> 1:30:10.500]  The metric every gauge we have shows that we're living shorter lives, we are diseased,
[1:30:10.500 --> 1:30:14.140]  our IQs are plunging, and we're ugly.
[1:30:14.140 --> 1:30:15.940]  We're falling apart.
[1:30:15.940 --> 1:30:21.540]  Big pharma and the entire lovelest operation is a kill grid, and the studies are clear.
[1:30:21.540 --> 1:30:28.660]  The average person is in a dream-like state, a near dream-like daydream world, program
[1:30:28.660 --> 1:30:31.980]  of the flicker rates of the televisions and all the screens.
[1:30:31.980 --> 1:30:39.220]  We are in a trance, and now they're turning up the power of the ambient electromagnetic
[1:30:39.220 --> 1:30:46.180]  radiation, which again, all the studies conclusively show, cause massive cancer and destroy your
[1:30:46.180 --> 1:30:50.300]  immune system and push viruses across the cell membrane.
[1:30:50.300 --> 1:30:56.580]  We are being murdered, and I've got to tell you, it's very sophisticated and looks nonhuman.
[1:30:56.580 --> 1:31:00.660]  One of the best nutrients nature has provided beetroot has been used for hundreds of years
[1:31:00.660 --> 1:31:01.940]  in natural medicine.

[1:32:00.980 --> 1:32:02.980]  I've done nothing but my duty.
[1:32:02.980 --> 1:32:07.980]  I discovered a bunch of bloodthirsty scum coming after innocent people and I've been
[1:32:07.980 --> 1:32:14.980]  fighting them for 13 years and I'll never stop while I'm growing bread.
[1:32:14.980 --> 1:32:22.980]  Alex Jones and InfoWare's have been sounding the alarm for patriots worldwide, waking people
[1:32:22.980 --> 1:32:31.980]  up to the New World Order, Bohemian Grove, the American deep state, the rise of communist
[1:32:31.980 --> 1:32:39.980]  China, the plan for global depopulation and global elite pedophiles who prey off of our
[1:32:39.980 --> 1:32:40.980]  young.
[1:32:40.980 --> 1:32:46.980]  The enemy has done their best to destroy us, but because of your support, our fight continues.
[1:32:46.980 --> 1:32:52.980]  Join us, support the InfoWare and together we will slay the dragon.
[1:32:52.980 --> 1:32:59.980]  Keep fighting Alex, you're the gladiator.
[1:32:59.980 --> 1:33:08.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:08.980 --> 1:33:13.980]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[1:33:13.980 --> 1:33:16.980]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:16.980 --> 1:33:18.980]  Look, I don't put an act on here.
[1:33:18.980 --> 1:33:22.980]  I mean, I intellectually look at the news and the research, then I tell you how I really
[1:33:22.980 --> 1:33:23.980]  feel.
[1:33:23.980 --> 1:33:27.980]  And I think it's one reason we've been successful waking a lot of people up is I'm angry, I'll
[1:33:27.980 --> 1:33:28.980]  tell you.
[1:33:28.980 --> 1:33:33.980]  And now I'm just, I'm watching clearly a weaponized virus.
[1:33:33.980 --> 1:33:38.980]  That's why biologists are so scared of it, that's killing people.
[1:33:38.980 --> 1:33:45.980]  And then I'm seeing the very people who are behind it getting all this power out of it.
[1:33:45.980 --> 1:33:48.980]  And that, that is disgusting to me.
[1:33:48.980 --> 1:33:50.980]  So Dr. Francis Boyle is here.
[1:33:50.980 --> 1:33:53.980]  He, again, represents world leaders at the hay.
[1:33:53.980 --> 1:33:57.980]  He's also prosecuted people like Solomon Milojevic, dictator of Serbia.
[1:33:57.980 --> 1:34:00.980]  He's the author of the US biological weapons law.
[1:34:00.980 --> 1:34:05.980]  When he was on like eight, nine weeks ago and first broke all this, I'd have him back
[1:34:05.980 --> 1:34:06.980]  on.
[1:34:06.980 --> 1:34:08.480]  I'd say, well, break down again for listeners.
[1:34:08.480 --> 1:34:12.980]  How it's weaponized, the universities that sold it, the NIH, how thousands of those eyeballs
[1:34:12.980 --> 1:34:14.980]  is like, no, I've already covered that.
[1:34:14.980 --> 1:34:15.980]  Let's move on to what's happening now.
[1:34:15.980 --> 1:34:17.980]  And I get that people should go back and watch it.
[1:34:17.980 --> 1:34:20.980]  It's a banned video that I'm even trying to find it myself.
[1:34:20.980 --> 1:34:22.980]  It's like five minutes.
[1:34:22.980 --> 1:34:30.940]  But now watching this, I go back to this to have China do a 180 and change course in
[1:34:30.940 --> 1:34:32.940]  the world and say, okay, maybe it came out of our lab.
[1:34:32.940 --> 1:34:33.940]  We were doing stuff.
[1:34:33.940 --> 1:34:38.940]  But it was for the US with bats and COVID-19 style viruses where they give it to piglets,
[1:34:38.940 --> 1:34:41.940]  then they die and they grind up the piglets and feed them to them.
[1:34:41.940 --> 1:34:43.940]  You're the bio weapons expert.
[1:34:43.940 --> 1:34:46.940]  Now that you're getting this piece, obviously there's a lot more going on.
[1:34:46.940 --> 1:34:48.940]  What in the hell is going on here?
[1:34:48.940 --> 1:34:52.940]  And what do you expect to happen now?
[1:34:52.940 --> 1:35:04.940]  Well, I'm afraid that if President Trump doesn't understand that this is an extremely dangerous
[1:35:04.940 --> 1:35:14.940]  offensive biological warfare weapon that we, the American people are facing, a lot of us
[1:35:14.940 --> 1:35:16.940]  are going to die.
[1:35:16.940 --> 1:35:18.940]  There's no doubt about it.
[1:35:18.940 --> 1:35:23.940]  Because all the people Trump have around him, not counting vice president Pence have been
[1:35:23.940 --> 1:35:31.940]  lying and covering this up from the get go and have been promoting their own interests
[1:35:31.940 --> 1:35:33.940]  and their own agenda.
[1:35:33.940 --> 1:35:38.940]  And right now that is the direction in which we are moving.
[1:35:38.940 --> 1:35:49.940]  As you can see, despite all the happy talk on CNN and MSNBC and Fox and all the rest of them,
[1:35:49.940 --> 1:35:55.940]  COVID is completely out of anyone's control.
[1:35:55.940 --> 1:36:07.940]  It's only begun to take off in the rural sections of America that because of the greed of the
[1:36:07.940 --> 1:36:15.940]  Americans, these companies have lost so many of their doctors and hospitals.
[1:36:15.940 --> 1:36:22.940]  It's going to take through our rural people and our farmers like a hot knife through
[1:36:22.940 --> 1:36:23.940]  butter.
[1:36:23.940 --> 1:36:30.940]  It's going to go cut through and is cutting through our blue collar people without any
[1:36:30.940 --> 1:36:32.940]  question at all.
[1:36:32.940 --> 1:36:39.940]  What we're really seeing being implemented so far by these people, it is the Nazi philosophy
[1:36:39.940 --> 1:36:41.940]  of useless eaters.
[1:36:41.940 --> 1:36:45.940]  And that was condemned at Nuremberg, too.
[1:36:45.940 --> 1:36:47.940]  That was the Nazi philosophy.
[1:36:47.940 --> 1:36:55.940]  And we're seeing that with all these people advising Trump, well, let's get the economy going.
[1:36:55.940 --> 1:37:01.940]  And they're going to be sacrificing blue collar, white collar.
[1:37:01.940 --> 1:37:06.940]  They are sacrificing our medical doctors and nurses.
[1:37:06.940 --> 1:37:16.940]  They will be sacrificing our farmers, all in the name of making profits and getting power
[1:37:16.940 --> 1:37:18.940]  over all of us.
[1:37:18.940 --> 1:37:20.940]  Let me raise this paradox.
[1:37:20.940 --> 1:37:22.940]  You predicted it was weaponized.
[1:37:22.940 --> 1:37:24.940]  It came out of the lawn lab.
[1:37:24.940 --> 1:37:25.940]  They covered it up.
[1:37:25.940 --> 1:37:27.940]  Now the Chinese are basically admitting that.
[1:37:27.940 --> 1:37:31.940]  It's the NIH, it's the folks running things, so there's a paradox.
[1:37:31.940 --> 1:37:32.940]  Okay, it's a deadly virus.
[1:37:32.940 --> 1:37:38.940]  We don't know exactly how deadly or what groups, but they're using it to shut off the economy
[1:37:38.940 --> 1:37:41.940]  to kick Trump out, the very people that are behind it.
[1:37:41.940 --> 1:37:47.940]  And so how do you deal with that paradox of, yeah, China and the globalists are involved
[1:37:47.940 --> 1:37:53.940]  in it, but then Trump sees them trying to keep stuff shut down longer as a power grab.
[1:37:53.940 --> 1:37:58.940]  Okay, the vaccine, it's going to save you, you're right on that front because it ever gets a mutation.
[1:37:58.940 --> 1:37:59.940]  I mean, you're dead on all this.
[1:37:59.940 --> 1:38:01.940]  I'm trying to understand then.
[1:38:01.940 --> 1:38:02.940]  I mean, I get it.
[1:38:02.940 --> 1:38:03.940]  They bred it up.
[1:38:03.940 --> 1:38:04.940]  They released it.
[1:38:04.940 --> 1:38:05.940]  They use it to shut down Taiwan.
[1:38:05.940 --> 1:38:07.940]  You're saying maybe it leaked out.
[1:38:07.940 --> 1:38:14.940]  All I'm saying is how do we deal with an imploding economy and the paradox of the left and others
[1:38:14.940 --> 1:38:16.940]  wanting this to stall the economy?
[1:38:16.940 --> 1:38:22.940]  Well, I don't think, you know, we should pay much attention to the left and the left news
[1:38:22.940 --> 1:38:23.940]  media.
[1:38:23.940 --> 1:38:28.940]  That's why I'm appearing here because they're not going to let me on there and say what I'm
[1:38:28.940 --> 1:38:29.940]  saying.
[1:38:29.940 --> 1:38:30.940]  I'm not anti-Trump.
[1:38:30.940 --> 1:38:31.940]  I'm not pro-Trump.
[1:38:31.940 --> 1:38:33.940]  I'm a political independent.
[1:38:33.940 --> 1:38:39.940]  I'm just trying to give the best technical advice I can here.
[1:38:39.940 --> 1:38:47.940]  And yes, this coronavirus is extremely deadly as far as I can figure out.
[1:38:47.940 --> 1:38:53.940]  It's nanotechnology, which is why it's maybe 120 microns.
[1:38:53.940 --> 1:38:57.940]  Well, where do they get that nanotechnology?
[1:38:57.940 --> 1:38:58.940]  Guess what?
[1:38:58.940 --> 1:39:07.940]  The chair of the Harvard chemistry department, an expert on nanotechnology, has his own lab
[1:39:07.940 --> 1:39:11.220]  over there in Wuhan.
[1:39:11.220 --> 1:39:14.820]  And I suspect that's where they got the nanotechnology.
[1:39:14.820 --> 1:39:22.300]  The last time we have seen technology this dangerous was the Amerithrax, which I blew
[1:39:22.300 --> 1:39:24.380]  the whistle on that, too.
[1:39:24.380 --> 1:39:30.540]  And that had nanotechnology involved, too, which is how I knew it was a super weapons-grade
[1:39:30.540 --> 1:39:31.540]  anthrax.
[1:39:31.540 --> 1:39:36.220]  That was a trillion spores for Graham.
[1:39:36.220 --> 1:39:38.540]  The only way you could do that was nanotechnology.
[1:39:38.540 --> 1:39:39.540]  That's right.
[1:39:39.540 --> 1:39:41.820]  And you got the experimental vaccine program with the anthrax.
[1:39:41.820 --> 1:39:42.820]  Stop the Pentagon.
[1:39:42.820 --> 1:39:45.340]  The amount of stuff you've done is just crazy.
[1:39:45.340 --> 1:39:46.660]  And it's not about credit.
[1:39:46.660 --> 1:39:48.980]  You just, people, you know, the stuff you've done, Dr. Bull, you're prestigious when it
[1:39:48.980 --> 1:39:50.540]  comes to that.
[1:39:50.540 --> 1:39:53.980]  And so you're just saying, we need to be very concerned, because it's clearly man-made.
[1:39:53.980 --> 1:39:54.980]  It's weaponized.
[1:39:54.980 --> 1:39:55.980]  It's been miniaturized.
[1:39:55.980 --> 1:39:58.620]  And it's got NIH fingerprints all over it.
[1:39:58.620 --> 1:40:01.260]  Well, then I sit back, sir, and you don't speculate.
[1:40:01.260 --> 1:40:02.260]  I do.
[1:40:02.260 --> 1:40:03.340]  That's my job.
[1:40:03.340 --> 1:40:06.380]  And I look at this, and I see how they covered it up.
[1:40:06.380 --> 1:40:07.380]  It's been released.
[1:40:07.380 --> 1:40:11.180]  It's shutting down our economy, and I understand that's a paradox.
[1:40:11.180 --> 1:40:13.700]  It's doing it because it is an early virus, but they knew it would do that.
[1:40:13.700 --> 1:40:14.700]  They're using it.
[1:40:14.700 --> 1:40:18.300]  And then I ask myself, well, they needed to shut down Taiwan.
[1:40:18.300 --> 1:40:20.260]  They needed to shut down the mainland.
[1:40:20.260 --> 1:40:22.180]  Xi Jinping was embarrassed.
[1:40:22.180 --> 1:40:24.060]  The globalists gave them this weapon.
[1:40:24.060 --> 1:40:27.700]  Did they advise Xi Jinping to let this get out or to not make it a big deal and cover
[1:40:27.700 --> 1:40:32.220]  it up so that they would then praise Xi Jinping for his response, but say America's response
[1:40:32.220 --> 1:40:33.340]  was terrible?
[1:40:33.340 --> 1:40:36.660]  Because even if they didn't do that, they're using the virus to try to bring down Trump
[1:40:36.660 --> 1:40:37.660]  right now.
[1:40:37.660 --> 1:40:40.900]  Well, that is correct.
[1:40:40.900 --> 1:40:45.860]  If you look at today's New York Times, they have a big article on what they say are all
[1:40:45.860 --> 1:40:52.060]  Trump's crooks, but they say nothing at all about the fact this went back to Obama.
[1:40:52.060 --> 1:41:01.580]  If you read that UNC article, it says right there, and let me quote here in case there's
[1:41:01.580 --> 1:41:03.900]  any doubt.
[1:41:03.900 --> 1:41:10.020]  This is the UNC Wuhan 4 Smoking Gun article.
[1:41:10.020 --> 1:41:19.020]  Well, experiments with the full length of and chimeric SHCO1 form recombinant viruses
[1:41:19.020 --> 1:41:26.900]  were initiated and performed prior to the gain of function research funding pause.
[1:41:26.900 --> 1:41:36.740]  That pause was by Obama, because many scientists have said it was extremely existentially dangerous
[1:41:36.740 --> 1:41:37.860]  if it escaped.
[1:41:37.860 --> 1:41:40.900]  So they sent it to China to complete the research.
[1:41:40.900 --> 1:41:47.940]  Well, China, I think the research was completed and then China turbocharged it, probably with
[1:41:47.940 --> 1:41:55.020]  that nanotechnology from the Harvard chair of the chemistry department because if who's
[1:41:55.020 --> 1:41:59.220]  now been arrested, let me let me finish the point.
[1:41:59.220 --> 1:42:09.300]  If the nanotechnology could not have been used at a BSL3, you can only use nanotechnology
[1:42:09.300 --> 1:42:12.820]  at a BSL4 like a marathon.
[1:42:12.820 --> 1:42:22.020]  So my guess is this thing was finally assembled at the BSL4 there in Wuhan.
[1:42:22.020 --> 1:42:26.460]  But let me let me continue.
[1:42:26.460 --> 1:42:37.020]  So this BSL3 work with the gain of function for the coronavirus, SARS coronavirus, by
[1:42:37.020 --> 1:42:45.860]  the way, performed prior to the gain of function research funding pause by Obama and have since
[1:42:45.860 --> 1:42:52.020]  been reviewed by Obama and approved by Obama.
[1:42:52.020 --> 1:42:53.700]  Let's explain what that means when we come back.
[1:42:53.700 --> 1:42:55.020]  This is the key right now, folks.
[1:42:55.020 --> 1:42:56.940]  Stay there, Dr. Boyle.
[1:42:56.940 --> 1:43:03.620]  When one studies history and human nature, you learn very quickly that rugged individualism
[1:43:03.620 --> 1:43:09.380]  and people to think for themselves, build free societies, innovate to amazing things.
[1:43:09.380 --> 1:43:14.980]  But those that love to grovel, those that love to be subservient, those that love to
[1:43:14.980 --> 1:43:21.820]  apply and think that it's a virtue, they create stagnation, corruption, tyranny and then finally
[1:43:21.820 --> 1:43:27.020]  collapse and the world is now being tested.
[1:43:27.020 --> 1:43:32.060]  And we're seeing lots of dutiful individuals who've complied and submitted their whole
[1:43:32.060 --> 1:43:38.020]  lives believing if they just submit now in a bigger way, somehow they'll create a heavenly
[1:43:38.020 --> 1:43:39.020]  future.
[1:43:39.020 --> 1:43:47.700]  But the technocrats running the global system are oppressive and anti-human and are psychotic
[1:43:47.700 --> 1:43:50.460]  and are building an anti-human future.
[1:43:50.460 --> 1:43:57.100]  Submission to them is like tying a big boulder on your neck and throwing it into the ocean.
[1:43:57.100 --> 1:43:59.540]  We told you it was coming.
[1:43:59.540 --> 1:44:04.340]  We told you that use of virus to scare everyone into submission and set up martial law and
[1:44:04.340 --> 1:44:08.780]  quarantines and lockdowns and now it's here and I'm here to tell you the rest of the story.
[1:44:08.780 --> 1:44:14.260]  Three things we all need to do, pray to God for justice and seek his face and repent.
[1:44:14.260 --> 1:44:17.820]  Get politically active and wake others up to understand this is the world government,
[1:44:17.820 --> 1:44:23.380]  the castle society it's all being announced and get prepared yourselves and boost your
[1:44:23.380 --> 1:44:29.060]  immune systems and get high quality food and we're able to ship storeable food again.
[1:44:29.060 --> 1:44:33.900]  Our supplier has expanded their factories and now are able to take new wars and it's
[1:44:33.900 --> 1:44:37.420]  not about this virus folks, that's only the trigger, the detonator, it's about what's
[1:44:37.420 --> 1:44:41.380]  coming in the future with elections may be canceled with the globalists trying to implode
[1:44:41.380 --> 1:44:42.380]  the economy.
[1:44:42.380 --> 1:44:47.220]  This is just the beginning of the crisis, not the middle and not the end.
[1:44:47.220 --> 1:44:52.180]  So get prepared now while you still can at m4shore.com and please be Paul Ramirez and
[1:44:52.180 --> 1:44:56.460]  spread the word.
[1:44:56.460 --> 1:45:00.660]  One of our best selling products is living defense and it's been sold out for over four
[1:45:00.660 --> 1:45:03.980]  months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[1:45:03.980 --> 1:45:07.340]  We've got a limited supply right now but it's selling out fast and I want those of you that
[1:45:07.340 --> 1:45:10.940]  haven't experienced living defense to get it for yourself, here's just part of one
[1:45:10.940 --> 1:45:11.940]  testimonial.
[1:45:11.940 --> 1:45:16.620]  I looked in January 2016 I went in a hospital, I went to VA hospital out here in Boyce and
[1:45:16.620 --> 1:45:20.700]  I was in there until June and one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was
[1:45:20.700 --> 1:45:25.780]  listening to info wars three hours a day and I kept hearing Dr. Groob and all you guys
[1:45:25.780 --> 1:45:30.020]  talking about living defense, let me tell you something man, I had an internal digestive
[1:45:30.020 --> 1:45:34.260]  problem and I stumbled with it for about five or six years and the doctors they tried
[1:45:34.260 --> 1:45:38.060]  every time nobody could figure out what it is and then every day when I kept hearing
[1:45:38.060 --> 1:45:41.340]  you and Dr. Groob and those commercials I said you know what I'm going to get me some
[1:45:41.340 --> 1:45:44.540]  of that freaking living defense now I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because
[1:45:44.540 --> 1:45:48.060]  they don't want you to have that stuff but I ordered it and it shipped to me, I got it,
[1:45:48.060 --> 1:45:52.820]  I hid it from the nurses, I started taking it man, that stuff changed my life, it saved
[1:45:52.820 --> 1:45:53.820]  my life.
[1:45:53.820 --> 1:45:56.820]  Alex Jones and info wars saved my life.
[1:45:56.820 --> 1:46:05.340]  Hey, listen, Alex Jones and the resistance are still on air, they're at band.videoandinfowars.com
[1:46:05.340 --> 1:46:10.460]  all you gotta do is go to infowars.com, forward slash show and you'll find Alex Jones' broadcast
[1:46:10.460 --> 1:46:14.740]  live and you'll find Owen Troyer at the war room, David Knight and so much more special
[1:46:14.740 --> 1:46:21.300]  broadcast films, emergency reports, it's all there and the globalists have worked around
[1:46:21.300 --> 1:46:25.940]  the clock to take him off air but something's happening, the public has been spreading the
[1:46:25.940 --> 1:46:31.380]  word that the forbidden truth lives at infowars.com, forward slash show and band.video and it's
[1:46:31.380 --> 1:46:37.260]  growing exponentially and the attempts to censor are only backfiring but we can supercharge
[1:46:37.260 --> 1:46:42.740]  this right now, if all of you listening realize hey, you know how to find the show but other
[1:46:42.740 --> 1:46:47.980]  people don't, they believe mainstream media that was off the air so you can override the
[1:46:47.980 --> 1:46:52.340]  corporate media, the establishment, all of them at this critical time and tell folks that
[1:46:52.340 --> 1:46:59.820]  the truth lives and it's back on air at infowars.com
[1:46:59.820 --> 1:47:25.900]  or listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:25.900 --> 1:47:30.460]  We are not in normal times, we are in the launch of the globalist takeover, Bill Gates
[1:47:30.460 --> 1:47:35.740]  is behind all of this from my research, has forced inoculations, digital tattoos in your
[1:47:35.740 --> 1:47:42.140]  vaccines, world government apps to track you, Google's now announced with Apple, they're
[1:47:42.140 --> 1:47:49.020]  merging when it comes to this to surveil everybody and we've got Democrat Governor Whitmer adds
[1:47:49.020 --> 1:47:54.260]  U.S. flags the list of banned products during lockdown, that's just a gratuitous power grab.
[1:47:54.260 --> 1:48:00.660]  Coronavirus UK lockdown restrictions could remain until cure or vaccine found, Italy extends
[1:48:00.660 --> 1:48:06.860]  lockdown despite business pressure and then you see communist Chinese propaganda everywhere
[1:48:06.860 --> 1:48:11.820]  that you cannot say it came from China, you can't discuss where it came from, the UN says
[1:48:11.820 --> 1:48:17.700]  it's a global problem, yeah but knowing where something came from is important so that who's
[1:48:17.700 --> 1:48:23.180]  behind it doesn't do it again but we're told oh no it's not man made, it's out of this
[1:48:23.180 --> 1:48:31.180]  animal market, well okay it probably came out of our lab but the U.S. funded us, well
[1:48:31.180 --> 1:48:35.500]  that means the bureaucrats and the other power structure, the same group seizing power right
[1:48:35.500 --> 1:48:40.380]  now I'm blaming President Trump, I'm not here to defend Trump, I'm here to defend the facts.
[1:48:40.380 --> 1:48:44.180]  So to Francis Boyle who I introduce again as the author of the U.S. biological weapons
[1:48:44.180 --> 1:48:48.580]  law, a lot of it got adopted as treaty, people ask why do you introduce a guest every time?
[1:48:48.580 --> 1:48:53.140]  Because we have 10 minute segments about radio and TV broadcast, we have thousands of people
[1:48:53.140 --> 1:48:58.660]  tuning in every 30 seconds, so I'm just reintroducing who our guest is, very prestigious, you've
[1:48:58.660 --> 1:49:02.660]  got to go to Band-Aid video, he predicted all of this 8-9 weeks ago, we've shown those
[1:49:02.660 --> 1:49:08.300]  articles on screen where he talks about it being gained a function, biological weapon,
[1:49:08.300 --> 1:49:13.860]  he was reading earlier the documents where Obama paused this then unpaused this so start
[1:49:13.860 --> 1:49:18.300]  over again, police are in and finish up with this critical part about the Providence or
[1:49:18.300 --> 1:49:22.820]  the pedigree of this virus with the Chinese government now admitting okay, we were funded
[1:49:22.820 --> 1:49:28.860]  by the NIH to do this, this is huge.
[1:49:28.860 --> 1:49:38.460]  Right, and as you suggested at the beginning Alex, we the American people are in the fight
[1:49:38.460 --> 1:49:45.580]  of our lives here, the first world war no one invaded us, the second world war there
[1:49:45.580 --> 1:49:50.540]  wasn't a snowball chance in hell, Hitler and the Nazis could invade us, the closest
[1:49:50.540 --> 1:49:54.900]  the Japanese got with the Aleutian Islands which were not part of the United States
[1:49:54.900 --> 1:50:05.140]  at that time, but COVID has invaded us, we are at war with an offensive biological warfare
[1:50:05.140 --> 1:50:14.140]  weapon, President Trump has a level with the American people and move forward from there,
[1:50:14.140 --> 1:50:21.180]  right now we are not behaving that way at all, if you listen to all the advisers around
[1:50:21.180 --> 1:50:27.500]  President Trump, they're lying about it, they're covering up, most of them are in their eyeballs
[1:50:27.500 --> 1:50:34.260]  about, oh and let me say a word here about Jared Kushner that you know the President
[1:50:34.260 --> 1:50:41.100]  Trump put Kushner in charge, well Kushner was so dumb his daddy had to buy his way
[1:50:41.100 --> 1:50:47.260]  into Harvard, I spent two years teaching at undergraduates at Harvard, there were all
[1:50:47.260 --> 1:50:54.020]  sorts of kids there whose parents bought their way into Harvard or their parents were very
[1:50:54.020 --> 1:51:00.860]  powerful people, President G have sent his daughter to Harvard, so they're not the brightest
[1:51:00.860 --> 1:51:07.300]  folks in the box, that's the man we now have running this for President Trump, well you
[1:51:07.300 --> 1:51:13.860]  know this is craziness, this is insanity, these people are going to get hundreds of
[1:51:13.860 --> 1:51:20.460]  thousands of Americans killed, I kid you not, well let me say it this way Dr. Boyle
[1:51:20.460 --> 1:51:23.740]  then there's three paths here and you can look at it from a Machiavellian perspective
[1:51:23.740 --> 1:51:28.860]  as I know you were trained in not to be Machiavellian but to understand it, either you go with total
[1:51:28.860 --> 1:51:32.700]  hysteria into the world, Trump has a big power grab out of that like the left's trying to
[1:51:32.700 --> 1:51:36.540]  do, that's one way to beat them is just to go their path and I'll do them, I don't want
[1:51:36.540 --> 1:51:42.500]  to do that, come out and say hey we're tough, we can handle 100,000 dead, 200,000 dead,
[1:51:42.500 --> 1:51:46.420]  yeah let's just power through and get the economy going, or come out and say no it's
[1:51:46.420 --> 1:51:50.660]  a chai con globalist operation, NIH did it, I didn't know Fauci and these guys were all
[1:51:50.660 --> 1:51:54.860]  involved, Trump talks about it, they instantly are all discredited and then be honest with
[1:51:54.860 --> 1:52:00.340]  the public and say what do you want to do and then the public hears that, they'll basically
[1:52:00.340 --> 1:52:03.860]  do whatever Trump wants because they'll trust him, I mean those are the three paths, right
[1:52:03.860 --> 1:52:08.620]  now Trump's trying to go between denying it's happening and going into hysteria and
[1:52:08.620 --> 1:52:12.540]  then the left's using that to shut off the economy instead of actually dealing with where
[1:52:12.540 --> 1:52:17.580]  it came from, America learns this is an attack on it by design will be like the British being
[1:52:17.580 --> 1:52:21.740]  bombed by Hitler, it's not going to make us give up, it's going to make us get pissed
[1:52:21.740 --> 1:52:22.740]  off.
[1:52:22.740 --> 1:52:30.380]  Right I think you know again my advice under the current circumstances would be for President
[1:52:30.380 --> 1:52:39.180]  Trump to level with the American people and then you know I've heard this general who
[1:52:39.180 --> 1:52:48.940]  handled the Katrina catastrophe down there and he has excellent ideas in my opinion about
[1:52:48.940 --> 1:52:57.700]  what needs to be done to fight back against COVID, he's given several interviews on MSNBC,
[1:52:57.700 --> 1:53:07.180]  he successfully handled Hurricane Katrina, he has advice on how the military can be used
[1:53:07.180 --> 1:53:13.500]  not to control the American people but just for logistics, supplies and things of this
[1:53:13.500 --> 1:53:14.500]  nature.
[1:53:14.500 --> 1:53:18.500]  Well that's another thing we said this six weeks ago, now they're reporting that the
[1:53:18.500 --> 1:53:23.380]  food is going to start running out with this lockdown.
[1:53:23.380 --> 1:53:31.340]  It's going to happen and you know the president has already activated the reserves and the
[1:53:31.340 --> 1:53:37.940]  individual ready reserves and I'm afraid that this is going to be used against the American
[1:53:37.940 --> 1:53:38.940]  people.
[1:53:38.940 --> 1:53:42.700]  Yeah that's the direction we are moving in now.
[1:53:42.700 --> 1:53:45.860]  People go wait a minute, we need the military but we don't, it's a paradox, if they're
[1:53:45.860 --> 1:53:49.580]  used right it's good, if they're used wrong it's bad and people get confused by that.
[1:53:49.580 --> 1:53:53.940]  Dr. Boil thank you so much for the time, hopefully you can join us again later in the week because
[1:53:53.940 --> 1:53:56.020]  so much is going on, thank you so much.
[1:53:56.020 --> 1:54:01.380]  Well again thank you for having me on and I say to everyone, keep the faith here in
[1:54:01.380 --> 1:54:03.660]  the American people, right?
[1:54:03.660 --> 1:54:04.660]  Absolutely thank you Dr. Boil.
[1:54:04.660 --> 1:54:08.420]  You know a lot of listeners will ask me, they say hey you have one guest on saying this
[1:54:08.420 --> 1:54:12.620]  whole thing's a hoax, you have another guest on saying this is super real.
[1:54:12.620 --> 1:54:16.620]  We know it's real, we know something's going on, the question is how bad is it and the
[1:54:16.620 --> 1:54:21.060]  left as you hear him saying is trying to make it crash the economy.
[1:54:21.060 --> 1:54:23.980]  If America knows what it's dealing with and has confidence it won't matter what happens,
[1:54:23.980 --> 1:54:25.660]  we can deal with it.
[1:54:25.660 --> 1:54:30.260]  They're trying to use the crisis to undermine the president and undermine confidence in
[1:54:30.260 --> 1:54:33.860]  the country to bring that down, we definitely don't want that.
[1:54:33.860 --> 1:54:38.940]  So this is a very sophisticated problem but Boil was on early February.
[1:54:38.940 --> 1:54:45.940]  Okay so we're talking nine weeks ago, he was like, I looked it up, he was like online February
[1:54:45.940 --> 1:54:51.260]  3rd, 4th or something the first time on this and so that's February, March, April, that's
[1:54:51.260 --> 1:54:56.300]  nine weeks, we're here on April 12th and he just waited it all out, it's Wuhan, it was
[1:54:56.300 --> 1:55:02.340]  transformed from here, NIH, blah, blah and now that's admitted, the Chinese are admitting
[1:55:02.340 --> 1:55:10.420]  it, so he has a lot of credibility, it doesn't mean all his projections are right and nobody's
[1:55:10.420 --> 1:55:15.460]  are, none of us are God but God and so you know Mike Adams had some dire projections
[1:55:15.460 --> 1:55:18.340]  and we're seeing much lower numbers on the curve.
[1:55:18.340 --> 1:55:21.900]  Well is that because the American people, first it was way up here, now it was half
[1:55:21.900 --> 1:55:25.260]  of that, now it's down here, they all went out and took vitamin D3, they all went out
[1:55:25.260 --> 1:55:29.300]  and took zinc, they all went out and took vitamin C, I mean we know that really mitigates
[1:55:29.300 --> 1:55:32.500]  but still if you're old or have a pre-existing condition it's bad.
[1:55:32.500 --> 1:55:36.660]  The fear is it is a bio weapon, the globalist cooked it up, they want to use it to push
[1:55:36.660 --> 1:55:40.180]  in martial law, they want it to be as bad as possible, that's why they don't want you
[1:55:40.180 --> 1:55:44.300]  knowing about things that boost your immunity, it's just an incredible time to be alive.
[1:55:44.300 --> 1:55:48.460]  Dr. Group was on two years ago, it was the last time he did an interview, he wouldn't
[1:55:48.460 --> 1:55:54.180]  tell me why, he gave me a call yesterday morning and told me why, I'm not at liberty to reveal
[1:55:54.180 --> 1:56:02.140]  that yet but I got into some of it, the video is posted on infowars.com and it deals with
[1:56:02.140 --> 1:56:07.300]  you know the fact that he did predict that 5G lowers oxygen in the lungs, allows viral
[1:56:07.300 --> 1:56:10.940]  infections, he showed the studies, we're not saying 5G creates the virus as we're saying
[1:56:10.940 --> 1:56:16.220]  it, exacerbates and lowers immunity, he predicted it including Wuhan two years ago, it's an
[1:56:16.220 --> 1:56:20.460]  incredible interview, there's another one going up soon, let's say he's the last interview
[1:56:20.460 --> 1:56:24.420]  it was me, he went on Owen Troyer right after that, he got even more detail, so that's an
[1:56:24.420 --> 1:56:25.420]  amazing interview.
[1:56:25.420 --> 1:56:29.860]  They're trying to shut us down, your word of mouth is absolutely king, I don't know
[1:56:29.860 --> 1:56:33.700]  what we get out, it's you telling folks about the videos, the articles like the one we just
[1:56:33.700 --> 1:56:37.460]  put on screen, in fact I forget the exact title of that video, the one I titled yesterday
[1:56:37.460 --> 1:56:42.100]  when you put it on screen for Band-Aid video, I'll tell folks the title of that interview
[1:56:42.100 --> 1:56:49.260]  with him on May 4th, 2018, I'll pull out of my phone, it's at Band-Aid video, there it
[1:56:49.260 --> 1:56:57.100]  is, video, watch, research or predict virus slash 5G crisis in 2008 and it's a very important
[1:56:57.100 --> 1:57:04.140]  interview and yes, you buying products in 4store.com funds or operation plus you need it man, to
