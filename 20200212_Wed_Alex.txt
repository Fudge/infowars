[00:00.000 --> 00:21.920]  Winsday, February 12, 2020. There can no longer be any doubt. President Trump isn't waiting
[00:21.920 --> 00:34.800]  until he wins the election in 264 days. The launch, not the red wave, but the red storm.
[00:36.400 --> 00:44.480]  Now engulfing the swamp in D.C., hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of globalist operatives
[00:44.480 --> 00:52.480]  inside the State Department and the Justice Department and other agencies are being purged
[00:53.280 --> 00:59.760]  as we speak. Thank God. Here we are on this Wednesday worldwide transmission.
[01:00.960 --> 01:02.560]  And amazing things are happening.
[01:05.360 --> 01:13.520]  Trump is now finally realizing that he can't appease the bureaucracy, that the bureaucracy is
[01:13.520 --> 01:19.040]  more an enemy than shy comes. The people that have borrowed in and taken control of the Republic
[01:19.760 --> 01:27.360]  who believe that they own the American people. Their arrogance is now falling away and they
[01:27.360 --> 01:33.520]  are in a panicked mode because they've committed massive crimes in the last four and a half years
[01:33.520 --> 01:37.600]  trying to keep Trump out of office and trying to persecute his most stalwart supporters.
[01:37.600 --> 01:44.480]  And now they have the fear of God in their eyes and that is a good thing.
[01:50.880 --> 01:56.400]  Here's what President Trump had to say yesterday after U.S. attorneys resigned because
[01:57.120 --> 02:03.120]  they want to give Roger Stone a record-long sentence. Then of course you've got the head
[02:03.120 --> 02:09.200]  prosecutor who thought she was going to get a job at the Treasury who then resigned only to learn
[02:09.200 --> 02:14.560]  that that nomination was withdrawn. Here's President Trump talking about Roger Stone yesterday afternoon.
[02:20.080 --> 02:24.560]  Yeah, I thought it was ridiculous that of that. No, I didn't speak to the gist. I'd be able to
[02:24.560 --> 02:30.160]  do it if I wanted. I have the absolute right to do it. I stay out of things to a degree that
[02:30.160 --> 02:35.520]  people wouldn't believe but I didn't speak to them. I thought the recommendation was ridiculous.
[02:35.520 --> 02:41.280]  I thought the whole prosecution was ridiculous and I look at others that haven't been prosecuted
[02:41.280 --> 02:45.840]  or I don't know where it is now but when you see that I thought it was an insult to our country
[02:46.400 --> 02:52.720]  and it shouldn't happen and we'll see what what goes on there but that was a that was a
[02:52.720 --> 03:00.560]  horrible aberration. These are the I guess the the same Mueller people that put everybody through
[03:00.560 --> 03:08.560]  hell and I think it's a disgrace. No, I have not been involved with it at all. I don't want to
[03:08.560 --> 03:13.200]  talk about that now. I think it was a disgraceful recommendation. They ought to be ashamed of
[03:13.200 --> 03:18.320]  themselves. What they've done to General Flynn, what they've done to others and then the really
[03:18.320 --> 03:23.600]  guilty ones, people that have committed major crimes are getting away with it. I think it's a
[03:23.600 --> 03:35.440]  disgrace. President Trump is going to pardon Roger Stone after the conviction. Nancy Pelosi is
[03:35.440 --> 03:40.000]  trying to say that's illegal now even though it's right there in the Constitution. Hell,
[03:40.000 --> 03:47.840]  Bill Clinton pardoned cocaine dealers and child traffickers and but all that's okay. Trump's bad
[03:47.840 --> 03:52.400]  for trying to investigate corruption. America sees right through it. Really positive things are
[03:52.400 --> 04:01.760]  happening. Jesse Smolier as he's called. Mr. Smollett, the mullet, had the nerve to sue the
[04:01.760 --> 04:07.040]  police department for wrongful prosecution. Well, he's been indicted and a whole bunch of counts
[04:07.040 --> 04:12.640]  for the false flag operation. He got caught red-handed running. That's all coming up. Jesse
[04:12.640 --> 04:19.440]  Smolier indicted in Chicago over race attack hoax. Oh, but you're not supposed to question these
[04:19.440 --> 04:25.280]  big events, but we do most of the time they're staged. Just like ABC saying Trump allowed
[04:26.880 --> 04:33.440]  the Turks to blow up a Turkish city and that there were 5,000-foot red clouds,
[04:34.720 --> 04:41.120]  mushroom clouds. None of it was true. Nob Creek machine guns shoot out. They do damn well what
[04:41.120 --> 04:45.840]  they were doing. This group of criminals, time is coming to a close, but they've been so confident
[04:45.840 --> 04:50.800]  they win. What are they going to do now as they're routed? The collapse of the global
[04:50.800 --> 04:55.440]  system is upon us. The problem is it may bring down the economy with it.
[04:58.560 --> 05:05.520]  It is I, the leader of Cobra here for a message to President Trump, the American people,
[05:05.520 --> 05:12.160]  and Alex Jones of InfoWars. Our operation for our partners, the Communist Chinese,
[05:12.160 --> 05:19.680]  have bought control of your media. But it's true, your people are beginning to awaken.
[05:19.680 --> 05:26.800]  That's why Cobra is launching operations to trade a race war, mass shootings and bombings,
[05:26.800 --> 05:33.600]  which will be blamed on those loyal to America. Anyone wants to be staged since attacks,
[05:33.600 --> 05:39.600]  yet they're not blaming on Trump. We'll also be targeted by Cobra in the future.
[05:41.360 --> 05:48.240]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks
[05:48.240 --> 05:55.360]  and then blame you like we've done with Alex Jones, blaming him for mass shootings we committed.
[05:55.360 --> 06:03.360]  Ha ha ha! Hey, oh, come on!
[06:14.960 --> 06:18.720]  Well, I think this is a time to open the phones up throughout the entire four
[06:18.720 --> 06:21.360]  hours of my broadcast. I am your host Alex Jones,
[06:21.360 --> 06:32.280]  And we are 264 days out from the election on this Wednesday, February 12, 2020, transmission.
[06:32.280 --> 06:33.280]  Trump has done it.
[06:33.280 --> 06:40.440]  He's launched a massive legal, lawful purge of deep staters in the government.
[06:40.440 --> 06:41.440]  It's true.
[06:41.440 --> 06:42.440]  Trump is an outsider.
[06:42.440 --> 06:43.960]  He'd never been elected to even dog catcher.
[06:43.960 --> 06:48.800]  He didn't realize it's customary to remove the political apparatus of the party that
[06:48.800 --> 06:51.000]  was in power when you get in power.
[06:51.000 --> 06:56.480]  If you're in the same party and you get into office, you remove the adjuncts that were
[06:56.480 --> 07:00.760]  working even for your own party, usually, because they are loyal to who put them in
[07:00.760 --> 07:03.880]  power, not even to the party itself or the people.
[07:03.880 --> 07:11.760]  And so Trump had a major, major, major blunder when he did not remove those individuals.
[07:11.760 --> 07:17.960]  And so they were working against him the whole time as Obama and Hillary and neocon deep
[07:17.960 --> 07:18.960]  state moles.
[07:18.960 --> 07:23.720]  And Trump says he's firing all never droppers, excellent.
[07:23.720 --> 07:28.160]  And he is going to fire all anyone that's worked for Soros, excellent.
[07:28.160 --> 07:33.120]  And anyone that's worked for the Clintons, excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent.
[07:33.120 --> 07:34.440]  And it's now hundreds and hundreds.
[07:34.440 --> 07:35.440]  It was 70 yesterday.
[07:35.440 --> 07:37.400]  Now it's in the hundreds and hundreds.
[07:37.400 --> 07:43.280]  People are just being told, bye-bye, you don't have a job anymore, or they're being reassigned
[07:43.280 --> 07:51.360]  to the North Pole, and there needs to be a lot more of this.
[07:51.360 --> 07:56.320]  And Trump's signal that he's going to be partening Roger Stone, Pelosi says that she
[07:56.320 --> 08:03.680]  thinks it's illegal, that the DOJ, who does standardize and have recommendations from
[08:03.680 --> 08:11.120]  the top on what should be reasonable sentencing, Trump's whole justice reform movement is about
[08:11.120 --> 08:13.400]  having nonviolent people not serve as much time.
[08:13.400 --> 08:18.960]  So the idea that he can't, through the Justice Department, say, I want you to not give this
[08:18.960 --> 08:26.160]  person a longer sentence than you normally would in the sentencing guidelines is 100%
[08:26.160 --> 08:28.000]  in his purview.
[08:28.000 --> 08:31.560]  Remember whenever he said three years ago, oh, there's seven countries that don't even
[08:31.560 --> 08:37.160]  have passport offices, don't even have airports mainly, but the imams issue these, and then
[08:37.160 --> 08:44.200]  we're supposed to accept these passports that are off the back of a cereal box maybe, or
[08:44.200 --> 08:50.320]  out of a cracker's act box, and this is a power grab dictatorship, of course the Supreme
[08:50.320 --> 08:53.360]  Court ruled he could do that.
[08:53.360 --> 08:56.520]  It's written in the Constitution that that's the president's purview, that's what the
[08:56.520 --> 09:01.520]  chief executive does, he's over the borders, but they tried to claim it was preposterous
[09:01.520 --> 09:05.800]  and all these other federal courts, to look out at the Supreme Court, said he didn't have
[09:05.800 --> 09:09.480]  that power.
[09:09.480 --> 09:13.200]  How outrageous is that?
[09:13.200 --> 09:18.240]  Two months in jail for the swamp creature, yet 19 years recommended for Roger Stone,
[09:18.240 --> 09:24.520]  who's not even working for the Trump campaign, gee, that sounds very fair, Roger was the
[09:24.520 --> 09:30.720]  victim of rogue prosecutors, he goes on to say, drain the swamp.
[09:30.720 --> 09:35.520]  Rogue prosecutor's question mark, that's like saying as Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
[09:35.520 --> 09:42.440]  have a red nose, this is ridiculous, so a lot of exciting things happening on that front.
[09:42.440 --> 09:50.200]  Virginia has passed in their legislature, I guess the governor's got to sign it, a
[09:50.200 --> 09:57.600]  bill to ban semi-autos and suppressors and much more, so that nightmare situation, Virginia
[09:57.600 --> 10:03.200]  House passes ban on semi-auto firearms and suppressors in hyperpartisan vote, we're
[10:03.200 --> 10:10.320]  going to be getting into all that today as well, the latest on the virus, Dr. Francis
[10:10.320 --> 10:14.800]  Boyle's going to be joining us as he was on last week, now we have the Trump administration
[10:14.800 --> 10:18.680]  officially saying they believe it could be a man made by a weapon, you know, the Chinese
[10:18.680 --> 10:27.560]  ambassador saying, that's crazy, wow, crazy conspiracy theory, don't look here just like
[10:27.560 --> 10:37.360]  Jesse Smollett, we first came out the morning after it happened and I said, 2.30 in the
[10:37.360 --> 10:45.400]  morning, white dudes with bleach and a rope, attacking a black guy in sub-zero, that sounds
[10:45.400 --> 10:51.440]  about as probable as seeing Santa Claus actually fly by in the middle of the night, Jesse Smollett
[10:51.440 --> 10:59.960]  indicted in Chicago over race attack hoax, former Empire actor Jesse Smollett, as a lot
[10:59.960 --> 11:04.680]  of folks have called him, was indicted by a grand jury in Chicago on six counts of disorderly
[11:04.680 --> 11:09.840]  conduct for lying to police about the alleged racist and anti-gay attack on him that occurred
[11:09.840 --> 11:14.760]  in January last year, one that was defended by Maxine Waters and others, he's a great
[11:14.760 --> 11:19.720]  guy, the indictment was brought forward by special prosecutor Dan Webb last night according
[11:19.720 --> 11:24.680]  to Fox 32, we're going to play a clip of that, but yeah, let's go back to video for
[11:24.680 --> 11:32.640]  TV viewers, imagine the police show up at his multi-million dollar condo and he's explaining,
[11:32.640 --> 11:37.680]  oh, it happened an hour ago, I've still got the rope around my neck and a little scratch
[11:37.680 --> 11:46.280]  on his face and then he talks about how terrible it is and then he has a whole trail of how
[11:46.280 --> 11:52.240]  he did it, but how the media defended him and even attacked me and said, Jones is at
[11:52.240 --> 12:00.840]  it again, questioning things, you're not supposed to do that, and so again, the police show
[12:00.840 --> 12:07.240]  up and they don't buy any of it, look at the news, yes, ladies and gentlemen, and of course
[12:07.240 --> 12:13.720]  almost all of these racial attacks are as phony as a $3 bill, here's the local news
[12:13.720 --> 12:21.920]  report on it, Jesse Smollett, remember him, well, he has been indicted today by a special
[12:21.920 --> 12:28.400]  prosecutor in Chicago, the former Empire actor was indicted today in Chicago by special
[12:28.400 --> 12:34.880]  prosecutor Dan Webb stemming from the alleged racist and anti-gay attack on him that occurred
[12:34.880 --> 12:42.680]  in January of 2019, a source confirms to our sister station, Fox 32 News in Chicago, Smollett
[12:42.680 --> 12:48.240]  told Chicago police last year that two men physically attacked him and yelled racial
[12:48.240 --> 12:55.120]  and homophobic slurs, prosecutors insist Smollett faked the racist anti-gay attack on himself
[12:55.120 --> 13:01.200]  in the hopes that the attention would advance his acting career, but with little explanation
[13:01.200 --> 13:06.880]  authorities last year abruptly dropped all charges against Smollett abandoning the criminal
[13:06.880 --> 13:12.960]  case only five weeks after the allegations were filed, in return prosecutors said that
[13:12.960 --> 13:19.760]  the actor agreed to let the city keep his $10,000 in bail, that this missile drew a swift
[13:19.760 --> 13:24.720]  backlash from the mayor and police chief and raised questions about why Smollett was not
[13:24.720 --> 13:30.800]  forced to admit that prosecutors had said that they could prove in court that the entire
[13:30.800 --> 13:37.080]  episode was a publicity stunt, just like everything the Democrats do, just like the attacks on
[13:37.080 --> 13:42.840]  the Jewish centers or the attacks at the Air Force Academy or the attacks here there everywhere.
[13:42.840 --> 13:46.720]  It's what the left does.
[13:46.720 --> 13:51.200]  My security people have caught them at rallies coming up and punching me in the back or pinching
[13:51.200 --> 13:56.040]  me and trying to get me to hit them and it's usually somebody in a wheelchair doing it
[13:56.040 --> 13:59.840]  because they want to have the image of me slugging somebody in a wheelchair.
[13:59.840 --> 14:03.280]  They're professional victims.
[14:03.280 --> 14:04.280]  That's what the left do.
[14:04.280 --> 14:11.880]  They virtue signal, but studies show they're nine times more likely not to give to charity.
[14:11.880 --> 14:14.560]  They could be black, they could be white, they could be old, they could be young, but
[14:14.560 --> 14:23.440]  what they do is manipulate and deceive and create division 24-7.
[14:23.440 --> 14:28.840]  Newsflash, there's not white dudes at 2.30 in the morning at 25 below zero running up
[14:28.840 --> 14:31.760]  starting fights with black dudes.
[14:31.760 --> 14:37.320]  It's not going on and everybody knows it, ladies and gentlemen, but this was an attempt
[14:37.320 --> 14:39.440]  to trigger a race war in this country.
[14:39.440 --> 14:40.440]  The same thing.
[14:40.440 --> 14:44.640]  Soros has been caught doing, his son's been caught doing, we have all the documents,
[14:44.640 --> 14:51.360]  hoping to foment a race war in this country with the media trying to exacerbate the crisis.
[14:51.360 --> 14:56.840]  This is terrorism, psychological warfare executed against the American people.
[14:56.840 --> 15:00.600]  But notice all the criminality of the Democrats isn't working anymore.
[15:00.600 --> 15:03.680]  So now as Trump strikes back, what's coming next?
[15:03.680 --> 15:05.080]  We'll break it down when we come back.
[15:05.080 --> 15:09.080]  Please don't forget, we are going to sell out the next few days of super silver three
[15:09.080 --> 15:15.320]  ounce and super silver one ounce immune gargle.
[15:15.320 --> 15:16.760]  We've already sold out of the 16 ounce.
[15:16.760 --> 15:22.160]  We are going to sell out of the super silver whitening toothpaste and super blue toothpaste
[15:22.160 --> 15:25.680]  within a couple of weeks at current sales rates because people know it has the patented
[15:25.680 --> 15:29.720]  nano silver in it that's so good for taking out these viruses and the rest of it.
[15:29.720 --> 15:35.360]  Well, I'm still got it at 50% off on the toothpaste, despite the fact it's going to sell out because
[15:35.360 --> 15:39.280]  I want people to have this in their hands, be able to defend themselves and see how great
[15:39.280 --> 15:41.480]  the product is.
[15:41.480 --> 15:46.600]  Get it all the immune gargle and the super silver before it sells out and so much more.
[15:46.600 --> 15:50.360]  And of course, storeable food, we have it in stock, high quality and fresh.
[15:50.360 --> 15:53.400]  Almost no one else does infowarstore.com.
[15:53.400 --> 15:56.560]  Get yours today because 2020 is already one hell of a year.
[15:56.560 --> 15:58.880]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[15:58.880 --> 16:02.800]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:02.800 --> 16:04.360]  I sued the IRS in one.
[16:04.360 --> 16:07.320]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:07.320 --> 16:10.600]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[16:10.600 --> 16:12.840]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[16:12.840 --> 16:14.160]  I can help you too.

[16:35.760 --> 16:41.160]  My team of lawyers enrolled agents and licensed tax experts removed wage gargles sometimes
[16:41.160 --> 16:42.160]  in the same day.
[16:42.160 --> 16:45.560]  We even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay through
[16:45.560 --> 16:47.720]  what is known as an offer in compromise.
[16:47.720 --> 16:49.960]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[16:49.960 --> 16:51.560]  Oh, can I ever?
[16:51.560 --> 16:56.800]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[16:56.800 --> 16:57.800]  Guess what?
[16:57.800 --> 17:02.480]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[17:02.480 --> 17:07.640]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot

[19:30.000 --> 19:35.200]  the bad halogen and people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful
[19:35.200 --> 19:42.040]  that finally I listened to Dr. Grip like eight years ago and started taking true iodine,

[20:40.440 --> 20:46.320]  But as soon as you start to get up and get engaged and start fighting back, start getting
[20:46.320 --> 20:52.600]  the blood pumping through your brain, through your muscles, through your body, you feel
[20:52.600 --> 20:59.960]  alive again and you don't feel like giving up, you feel like fighting back and make no
[20:59.960 --> 21:08.080]  mistake, humanity has some incredible obstacles facing it but we also have God on our side
[21:08.080 --> 21:11.720]  and the atheist and the establishment want us to believe that we're all alone in the
[21:11.720 --> 21:16.120]  universe and we don't have God but they know that's not true.
[21:16.120 --> 21:23.760]  They want us to forget about God so that we don't realize the birthright we have.
[21:23.760 --> 21:30.680]  So on this February 12th, Wednesday edition, I just want listeners to know something.
[21:30.680 --> 21:36.680]  There's a lot of different political ideas and systems out there but they all really
[21:36.680 --> 21:39.960]  boil down into two different groups.
[21:39.960 --> 21:44.320]  Systems that empower humanity and that are based on common sense and God's law and those
[21:44.320 --> 21:53.360]  that destroy humanity and are based on systems that don't work and are corrupt and God has
[21:53.360 --> 21:54.360]  a name for that.
[21:54.360 --> 22:02.760]  It's called sin and sin is just simply something that hurts you and hurts others and it's
[22:02.760 --> 22:07.960]  not in God's plan but so you've got free will so you can say piss on the owner's manual,
[22:07.960 --> 22:12.520]  it says put this type of motor oil in here, I'm going to put bleach in it and when it
[22:12.520 --> 22:17.400]  blows up, well that's not Ford's fault is it.
[22:17.400 --> 22:22.880]  It's not Ferrari's fault, it's not Chevy's fault, it's not Honda's fault.
[22:22.880 --> 22:32.680]  You put saltwater in the gas tank, it doesn't work but it's I guess kind of fun when you're
[22:32.680 --> 22:34.360]  doing it.
[22:34.360 --> 22:41.600]  At first watching the engine sees up I guess so here's what I wanted to say right now.
[22:41.600 --> 22:47.560]  We've seen all these people that got into the power structure and went to Harvard, went
[22:47.560 --> 22:52.120]  to Yale and got into the bureaucracy and both political parties shared power in the cell
[22:52.120 --> 22:57.840]  out of America to demoralize us, got behind the whole Hollywood system, tried to break
[22:57.840 --> 23:03.320]  the will of the American people but they miscalculated.
[23:03.320 --> 23:08.560]  They believed that they had frightened us and demoralized us, the truth is they just
[23:08.560 --> 23:13.560]  put us into a trance and now all this intimidation has just taken a lot of people out of the
[23:13.560 --> 23:15.600]  trance and it's only pissing them off more.
[23:15.600 --> 23:18.560]  There's a lot of examples of this I can give but look it brings it.
[23:18.560 --> 23:22.840]  I told people four and a half years ago in the past I said mark my words, this will take
[23:22.840 --> 23:28.160]  three to five years to finally get implemented and in the process of them trying to block
[23:28.160 --> 23:34.480]  the people they'll wake up even more and exactly that happened because when you've studied
[23:34.480 --> 23:44.680]  history it does repeat itself so now I'm trying to keep track of it but it's hundreds and
[23:44.680 --> 23:50.400]  hundreds of people have been fired in the last two days by President Trump from senior
[23:50.400 --> 23:54.200]  positions at the Justice Department and the State Department and the National Security
[23:54.200 --> 24:02.760]  Council and it's a beautiful thing and when he was paralyzed before because it was nothing
[24:02.760 --> 24:08.680]  but bad people under him he didn't know what he was doing now he's a quick learner and
[24:08.680 --> 24:14.760]  so oh you're being nominated over here at the Treasury Department, the woman that prosecuted
[24:14.760 --> 24:19.080]  Stone and engaged in all those incredible crimes in my view and by the way I was under
[24:19.080 --> 24:37.600]  investigation my father was under investigation, Beds tried to set me up posing as Russians
[24:37.600 --> 24:42.600]  and this is off record but there's national talk show hosts know about it and the documents
[24:42.600 --> 24:52.880]  and I've been into the FBI, I've been into the FBI offices, that's how far this went
[24:52.880 --> 25:01.720]  and just imagine how crazed the Democrats were they wanted to put me and my father in
[25:01.720 --> 25:05.360]  prison they thought that dog would hunt that the American people would believe that I was
[25:05.360 --> 25:13.760]  a Russian agent and that my dad was one that's with the government being able to look at
[25:13.760 --> 25:26.560]  my records and my dad's records and knowing that it's the opposite so why are we here
[25:26.560 --> 25:32.680]  because these arrogant SOB's thought that they were invincible and they sent the message
[25:32.680 --> 25:37.400]  out across the country to every bureaucracy, to every lawyer, to every fellow traveler
[25:37.400 --> 25:44.040]  harass Trump supporters spit on their food, sue them, lie about them, try to convince
[25:44.040 --> 25:49.840]  their wives and husbands to leave them this is the harassment that's been going on but
[25:49.840 --> 25:57.000]  instead of the harassment four years later working all it's done is piss people off and
[25:57.000 --> 26:04.320]  made them get more hardcore and that's what's beautiful about all of this.
[26:04.320 --> 26:07.640]  Again I had watched a lot of World War II documentaries in years but I watched World
[26:07.640 --> 26:13.440]  War II in color great documentary series the first couple hours is the war starting in
[26:13.440 --> 26:22.040]  the Battle of Britain and the Blitz and Hitler really thought if I bomb London they'll give
[26:22.040 --> 26:28.200]  up British intelligence knew if they bombed Berlin which they did just to piss Hitler
[26:28.200 --> 26:31.600]  off he would target the British people and that would get them behind the war they were
[26:31.600 --> 26:39.400]  not for the war they just lost millions a few decades before in World War I almost everybody
[26:39.400 --> 26:43.040]  had lost somebody or had somebody in their home with their arms and legs blown off or
[26:43.040 --> 26:49.360]  their lungs burn out from mustard gas and so they didn't want that but when Hitler bombed
[26:49.360 --> 26:59.800]  for hundreds of days straight the polls went from seventy percent against the war to ninety
[26:59.800 --> 27:06.160]  nine percent for it wow so the Democrats thought the same thing you think threatening us trying
[27:06.160 --> 27:12.240]  to put us in prison trying to set us up suing us you think doing all of this made me want
[27:12.240 --> 27:16.240]  to go get in a fetal position and piss all over myself you think it made the American
[27:16.240 --> 27:22.920]  people want to back down it did the opposite it made us really want to get our hands around
[27:22.920 --> 27:28.440]  your throats that's what it did it made me work even more hours and have more energy
[27:28.440 --> 27:35.240]  and get in better shape and get closer to God and your persecution made me stronger
[27:35.240 --> 27:39.280]  Frederick Nietzsche is right that which does not kill you only makes you stronger but only
[27:39.280 --> 27:44.840]  because of God and God working through the audience that supported us just like I have
[27:44.840 --> 27:49.360]  that spirit you have that spirit viewers that's why when you call in and thank me are you
[27:49.360 --> 27:58.840]  kidding me thank you because I've got a heart to fight but you had to keep us in the game
[27:58.840 --> 28:02.720]  and we're not out of the woods yet but let me tell you I can kind of see some openings
[28:02.720 --> 28:07.520]  and see some pretty green hills out there we're getting close there'll be more woods
[28:07.520 --> 28:11.320]  we got across later that's the way life is there's no utopia we're offering like Bernie
[28:11.320 --> 28:18.240]  Sanders does but America's been down on its knees a long time and America's starting to
[28:18.240 --> 28:22.800]  stand up and that is a beautiful beautiful thing so we're gonna come back play a bunch
[28:22.800 --> 28:26.640]  of clips I'm gonna give the number out first time callers again I want to get your take
[28:26.640 --> 28:30.200]  on the world what you think of Trump beginning to move forward against the deep state what
[28:30.200 --> 28:38.200]  else he needs to do how they're gonna counter strike 877789 Alex 8777892539 international

[31:55.320 --> 32:03.080]  at infowarstore.com I have confirmed with high level sources that president trump is intending
[32:03.080 --> 32:08.200]  to either pardon roger stone after his sentencing or give him clemency saying the conviction
[32:08.200 --> 32:15.040]  stands but you now basically don't go to jail either way this is incredibly good news but
[32:15.040 --> 32:19.280]  let's not forget julien assange that's one of the biggest black marks on trump is that
[32:19.280 --> 32:23.880]  he famously said I don't know who got the emails I don't know where they came from the
[32:23.880 --> 32:28.440]  russians a fat dude in his mom's basement whoever's got him release him it's about hillary
[32:28.440 --> 32:33.360]  committing a crime not who has the emails don't change the subject well julien assange
[32:33.360 --> 32:38.200]  undoubtedly took trump over the top the wiki leaks expose the deep state the man is a hero
[32:38.200 --> 32:43.120]  daniel elsberg was a hero well assange is even a bigger hero and he's rotting in solitary
[32:43.120 --> 32:47.760]  confinement and the court hearings can barely talk president trump do the right thing and
[32:47.760 --> 33:03.280]  ask the british to release julien assange and give him a medal you're listening to the alex
[33:03.280 --> 33:32.560]  jones show i don't care what mainstream media calls me
[33:32.560 --> 33:39.560]  the same mainstream media caught launching hoaxes routinely but i do care about what
[33:39.560 --> 33:44.800]  god thinks i do care about what you think i do care about what my children think i want
[33:44.800 --> 33:50.000]  to be a man that they know stands up for what he knows is right you're going back down from
[33:50.000 --> 33:57.960]  a fight because that's really what this life's all about is a test to see who you are selling
[33:57.960 --> 34:04.880]  out doesn't feel good folks fighting back having integrity well it's what it's all about toll
[34:04.880 --> 34:08.880]  free number to join us is eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine eight
[34:08.880 --> 34:14.800]  seven seven seven eight nine alex got a lot of clips a lot of news to cover but i really
[34:14.800 --> 34:18.200]  just want to start taking a lot of your calls but i want to just pull back and get back to
[34:18.200 --> 34:26.080]  what i was saying last segment because it cannot be overstated the democrats control
[34:26.080 --> 34:34.000]  their blue cities they're hated no one really votes for them they're a total fraud they do
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.680]  have some of the brainwash college students and people that think they're part of the
[34:36.680 --> 34:40.800]  establishment that are useful that he has to go along with it and they ruthlessly work
[34:40.800 --> 34:47.560]  with organized crime from ms-13 to the chinese triads to bleed off all the money to launder
[34:47.560 --> 34:54.360]  it and to basically engage in crimes never before seen at this scale and the blue blood
[34:54.360 --> 34:58.280]  republicans went along with this for the last fifty sixty years but they're being removed
[34:58.280 --> 35:05.760]  from power and they are systematically dying off right now and so yes president trump is
[35:05.760 --> 35:10.320]  beginning to strike back and remove a lot of the deep staters that's beautiful and wonderful
[35:10.320 --> 35:14.200]  but we've got to keep the pressure now on trump to make sure he does the right thing
[35:14.200 --> 35:21.640]  and that leads me to this next point there are two big reports out today that nexus together
[35:21.640 --> 35:30.960]  and that's the fact that russia gate was a premeditated hoax even the federal fisa court's
[35:30.960 --> 35:38.120]  own inspector general has said that and that it was done to illegally spy on the president
[35:38.120 --> 35:44.360]  well if you watch the congressional hearings through which the democrats gave the public
[35:44.360 --> 35:52.880]  orders via senator blumenthal and others to remove yours truly from the internet that
[35:52.880 --> 35:57.680]  was the precedent setting to do it everybody else and they did it in the intelligence
[35:57.680 --> 36:03.080]  committee in the senate and the house armed services committee in the house and the judiciary
[36:03.080 --> 36:09.000]  committee in the house with hearings for hours talking about myself roger stonem and
[36:09.000 --> 36:13.600]  the others saying we work for the russians now i'm not going to play those clips again
[36:13.600 --> 36:18.760]  you all heard them and they have tech heads they're going what are you going to do paul
[36:18.760 --> 36:25.440]  watson's story was top of twitter info wars dot com at lunch they said sir we know congressman
[36:25.440 --> 36:34.200]  quickly we're going to get that ban in fact we banned it by the end of lunch quickly said
[36:34.200 --> 36:38.040]  that's not good enough i don't want their fake news up there at the top what was the
[36:38.040 --> 36:43.440]  fake news just that one example was that a man had run over a crowd screaming a lot bar
[36:43.440 --> 36:48.040]  in new york it was true it was even on the local news but nationally they were able to
[36:48.040 --> 36:56.880]  suppress it was an islamic attack and so the fake news litmus was congressman quickly
[36:56.880 --> 37:05.520]  said it was fake they're like oh yes we know at lunch we saw it and buried it so trumps
[37:05.520 --> 37:10.560]  thinking he's been exonerated on russia gate and ukraine great and all this crap and he's
[37:10.560 --> 37:17.560]  starting to remove the bureaucrats people that did it but they gave the orders before
[37:17.560 --> 37:23.800]  that went out through the mockingbird national security apparatus that supposedly only used
[37:23.800 --> 37:30.240]  for the cold war against the soviets but obama legalized it ten years ago to use domestic
[37:30.240 --> 37:39.720]  propaganda against the american people including disinformation and so now the justice department
[37:39.720 --> 37:45.040]  had lawyer over any trust came out there's an article in hollywood reporter doj won't
[37:45.040 --> 37:53.760]  tackle politically biased media it's not our job but big tech isn't politically biased
[37:53.760 --> 37:59.960]  media it's a utility that operates under section 230 and isn't supposed to restrict what people
[37:59.960 --> 38:06.800]  say in live time using ai and so they go on to say we don't get involved in what companies
[38:06.800 --> 38:12.440]  speech is but it's not companies it's facebook and twitter and google and it's subsidiary
[38:12.440 --> 38:18.960]  youtube all spying in live time and now what's that for months is admittedly going in and
[38:18.960 --> 38:26.440]  blocking alex jones jordan peterson and donald trump videos and now nancy polosi videos
[38:26.440 --> 38:32.240]  because she doesn't like her tearing things up and it's being put up with prior constraint
[38:32.240 --> 38:40.120]  with big tech using ai to pre-program what you can send that's surveillance that's control
[38:40.120 --> 38:46.280]  that's concerted i told people 20 years ago your cameras are spying on you it was in the
[38:46.280 --> 38:52.160]  documents now they ask the question stupidly today getting everybody ready for it we're
[38:52.160 --> 38:58.680]  just being conditioned to accept it and we should not accept the surveillance the spying
[38:58.680 --> 39:02.720]  the selling of our data and then lying to conference and saying google's never fixed
[39:02.720 --> 39:08.640]  a search result so they make it purely an antitrust issue when clearly we've never
[39:08.640 --> 39:13.440]  seen monopolies this big google and its parent company alphabets dwarf anything microsoft
[39:13.440 --> 39:22.560]  ever was and now the pentagon is letting microsoft take over and unify the cloud system
[39:22.560 --> 39:31.160]  for the codes the coordination of fighter bombers anybody ever seen terminator two and
[39:31.160 --> 39:40.960]  skynet so that's where we are and the truth is there's a big sick marriage of big tech
[39:40.960 --> 39:48.600]  and government and trump knows that and so it's a big failing that they are going to
[39:48.600 --> 39:55.080]  just let big tech put the chinese social credit score live time surveillance spread over all
[39:55.080 --> 40:04.040]  of us and the decision has been made to just go ahead with the plan
[40:04.040 --> 40:12.200]  and then use it to suppress even mainline political speech the condition you to show
[40:12.200 --> 40:15.960]  you the only type of speech you can put out is that that's been pre-programmed and then
[40:15.960 --> 40:20.240]  whoever gets control of these companies can then just change the drop of a hat what they
[40:20.240 --> 40:28.240]  see as acceptable in live time and now they're announcing you know what big tech now has
[40:28.240 --> 40:31.480]  all these digital phone calls you can make over the apps that sound just as good as
[40:31.480 --> 40:36.720]  a phone or better don't need your phone system anymore and oh but the ai is going to be listening
[40:36.720 --> 40:40.920]  to that and it's going to just block out words you aren't supposed to say that could be done
[40:40.920 --> 40:51.920]  in live time now and so we can sit here and celebrate going after the democrat deep state
[40:51.920 --> 40:58.880]  and the neocons and all these horrible people but is trump just going to replace himself
[40:58.880 --> 41:03.960]  at the head of that because tim cook comes over and has dinner with him and avanka and
[41:03.960 --> 41:09.440]  jared and you know oh maybe apple's got a couple hundred plants over in china and he'll
[41:09.440 --> 41:13.320]  bring two or three over here so for that pat on the head we're just going to let apple
[41:13.320 --> 41:19.040]  and tim cook control everything and and sensor and block and and not let people's information
[41:19.040 --> 41:26.720]  be available in the free market of ideas that isn't dangerous that's destructive and that
[41:26.720 --> 41:33.840]  is tyranny playing out and taking place now and so i'm happy to see small it and i'm happy
[41:33.840 --> 41:40.400]  to see all these arrogant globalists getting fired and that's a good sign but the justice
[41:40.400 --> 41:45.160]  department comes out a month ago and the attorney general said well we probably might not do
[41:45.160 --> 41:50.200]  the whole antitrust thing but there could be other criminal charges for things they've
[41:50.200 --> 41:54.080]  been doing well well what could that be lying to congress working with the shy comms there's
[41:54.080 --> 41:58.320]  more than one way to skin a cat and i like to see the beginning of this forward motion
[41:58.320 --> 42:07.760]  against the tyranny that's very positive but we better see the president the justice department
[42:07.760 --> 42:17.280]  tell big tech you better stop reading people's text messages in real time and blocking them
[42:17.280 --> 42:22.000]  and control over people can say that's unamerican and that's beyond dangerous and so that's
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.920]  where i stand on all of this but the very groups they're now being shown to be frauds
[42:26.920 --> 42:32.160]  that try to have a coup and overthrow an elected president and and steal the votes of 65 million
[42:32.160 --> 42:39.400]  americans have voted for trump for 68 million use that lie of russia gate to put the censorship
[42:39.400 --> 42:46.680]  in that's now in place through the c o g systems put in the john warner defense authorization
[42:46.680 --> 42:53.080]  act of 2017 by obama before he left and so that's being left in place the russia hoax
[42:53.080 --> 42:59.720]  is still operating and still violating americans rights well it's finally happening the president
[42:59.720 --> 43:04.000]  is coming out and saying the deep state are a bunch of out of control criminals that need
[43:04.000 --> 43:11.920]  to be prosecuted and he has fired over 200 senior bureaucrats in the state department
[43:11.920 --> 43:17.600]  and the justice department in just the last few days and he took the head prosecutor over
[43:17.600 --> 43:23.480]  stone and offered her a job at treasury as soon as she quit that job he then withdrew
[43:23.480 --> 43:29.120]  the nomination and now she's out on her globalist ass this is beautiful it's happening but we
[43:29.120 --> 43:35.360]  need to see a lot more all the neocons need to be fired all the obama appointees fired
[43:35.360 --> 43:41.520]  all the deep state globalists who have resumes with george soros fired fired fired fired
[43:41.520 --> 43:48.640]  trump is finally unleashed trump is not the red wave he is the red storm and info wars
[43:48.640 --> 43:54.440]  is the tip of the spear powered by we the people never backing down never giving in

[47:50.200 --> 47:52.200]  You belong to the sea.
[47:52.200 --> 47:54.200]  The blood.
[47:54.200 --> 47:56.200]  We all share it.
[47:56.200 --> 47:58.200]  We are the people.
[47:58.200 --> 48:00.200]  We are the commoners.
[48:00.200 --> 48:02.200]  We are the light from the dark of the night.
[48:02.200 --> 48:04.200]  We are the innovation.
[48:04.200 --> 48:06.200]  We are the builders.
[48:06.200 --> 48:08.200]  You belong.
[48:08.200 --> 48:10.200]  You belong.
[48:10.200 --> 48:12.200]  They're trying to steal your American birthright from you.
[48:12.200 --> 48:14.200]  This country is so damn bad.
[48:14.200 --> 48:16.200]  Why does everybody want to get into it?
[48:16.200 --> 48:18.200]  Because they know it's the place where people
[48:18.200 --> 48:20.200]  at least try to be free.
[48:20.200 --> 48:22.200]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[48:22.200 --> 48:24.200]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[48:24.200 --> 48:26.200]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[48:26.200 --> 48:28.200]  And I don't gloat
[48:28.200 --> 48:30.200]  about the fact that Trump's finally
[48:30.200 --> 48:32.200]  purging a lot of the scum.
[48:32.200 --> 48:34.200]  It's hundreds and hundreds.
[48:34.200 --> 48:36.200]  It's just pouring in so fast.
[48:36.200 --> 48:38.200]  He's getting rid of any Obama
[48:38.200 --> 48:40.200]  people, any Hillary people.
[48:42.200 --> 48:44.200]  When Clinton got in in 1993,
[48:44.200 --> 48:46.200]  he fired
[48:46.200 --> 48:48.200]  every U.S. attorney.
[48:48.200 --> 48:50.200]  Trump didn't fire any
[48:50.200 --> 48:52.200]  and they said that he was
[48:52.200 --> 48:54.200]  using his power.
[48:54.200 --> 48:56.200]  Trump should
[48:56.200 --> 48:58.200]  fire everyone
[48:58.200 --> 49:00.200]  who hasn't already shown
[49:00.200 --> 49:02.200]  themselves to be loyal.
[49:02.200 --> 49:04.200]  He cannot
[49:04.200 --> 49:06.200]  leave his flank and his underbelly
[49:06.200 --> 49:08.200]  open.
[49:08.200 --> 49:10.200]  And the president's done nothing corrupt
[49:10.200 --> 49:12.200]  other than putting up with these corrupt
[49:12.200 --> 49:14.200]  people. That is a form of corruption
[49:14.200 --> 49:16.200]  in and of itself.
[49:16.200 --> 49:18.200]  And a dereliction of duty, but I understand he's been surrounded.
[49:18.200 --> 49:20.200]  But this is very pleasing.
[49:20.200 --> 49:22.200]  We'd all wondered
[49:24.200 --> 49:26.200]  would he wait to go after
[49:26.200 --> 49:28.200]  until he got reelected or would he strike now?
[49:28.200 --> 49:30.200]  He understands that they're not going to
[49:30.200 --> 49:32.200]  just sit there idly by.
[49:32.200 --> 49:34.200]  They're going to continue fake impeachments.
[49:34.200 --> 49:36.200]  They're going to continue making stuff up.
[49:36.200 --> 49:38.200]  So if Trump wants to survive,
[49:38.200 --> 49:40.200]  he's got to go on the attack.
[49:42.200 --> 49:44.200]  And what does that entail?
[49:44.200 --> 49:46.200]  What do you think? Where do you see this going?
[49:46.200 --> 49:48.200]  And doesn't he need to reverse the rest
[49:48.200 --> 49:50.200]  of it?
[49:50.200 --> 49:52.200]  That they use the whole Russiagate hoax
[49:52.200 --> 49:54.200]  with Obama's
[49:54.200 --> 49:56.200]  countering foreign disinformation propaganda
[49:56.200 --> 49:58.200]  act with billions of dollars
[49:58.200 --> 50:00.200]  to set up this surveillance
[50:00.200 --> 50:02.200]  grid that's been coordinated
[50:02.200 --> 50:04.200]  and this censorship grid that's been coordinated
[50:04.200 --> 50:06.200]  against his grassroots?
[50:08.200 --> 50:10.200]  I can take it.
[50:12.200 --> 50:14.200]  In fact, at a sick level, I like it.
[50:14.200 --> 50:16.200]  It's true.
[50:16.200 --> 50:18.200]  I don't like paying to be messed with,
[50:18.200 --> 50:20.200]  but it definitely gets me to wake up.
[50:20.200 --> 50:22.200]  I can be exhausted in some new attack comes
[50:22.200 --> 50:24.200]  and I'm like, have all this energy.
[50:24.200 --> 50:26.200]  But a lot of people don't like being treated
[50:26.200 --> 50:28.200]  like that, but here's the bottom line.
[50:28.200 --> 50:30.200]  We don't deserve to be treated
[50:30.200 --> 50:32.200]  like that and it's criminal
[50:32.200 --> 50:34.200]  to let these people continue to do it.
[50:34.200 --> 50:36.200]  So I'm telling the president
[50:36.200 --> 50:46.200]  we need relief and we need it now.
[50:48.200 --> 50:50.200]  So what does that relief look like?
[50:50.200 --> 50:52.200]  There's an operation I've been so busy
[50:52.200 --> 50:54.200]  the last three weeks
[50:54.200 --> 50:56.200]  that we have a warehouse full of these stickers.
[50:56.200 --> 50:58.200]  In fact, we have for Shay bring me
[50:58.200 --> 51:00.200]  the latest completed stickers.
[51:00.200 --> 51:02.200]  Please call them right now.

[51:08.200 --> 51:10.200]  that look like duct tape, but they don't pull your hair out.
[51:10.200 --> 51:12.200]  The sticker's not that strong, thank God.
[51:12.200 --> 51:14.200]  But it looks like duct tape
[51:14.200 --> 51:16.200]  and it says, indict the traitors
[51:16.200 --> 51:18.200]  20 different stickers.

[51:36.200 --> 51:38.200]  You can order packs of
[51:38.200 --> 51:40.200]  100, 500 and 1,000
[51:40.200 --> 51:42.200]  at cost.
[51:42.200 --> 51:44.200]  A 1,000 pack
[51:44.200 --> 51:46.200]  is $199
[51:46.200 --> 51:48.200]  and 500 pack
[51:48.200 --> 51:50.200]  is a lot less than that.
[51:50.200 --> 51:52.200]  And we have a website that we built
[51:52.200 --> 51:54.200]  that I need to write the final
[51:54.200 --> 51:56.200]  front page of myself.
[51:56.200 --> 51:58.200]  You guys go back to the shopping cart please.
[51:58.200 --> 52:00.200]  And
[52:00.200 --> 52:02.200]  just back so I can tell them the cost of the stickers.
[52:02.200 --> 52:04.200]  Yeah, you had it up there earlier.
[52:06.200 --> 52:08.200]  Yeah, so it's a 100 pack.
[52:08.200 --> 52:10.200]  It's $1995.
[52:10.200 --> 52:12.200]  500 pack is $9990
[52:12.200 --> 52:14.200]  or $75.
[52:14.200 --> 52:16.200]  And the 1,000 pack
[52:16.200 --> 52:18.200]  is $199.
[52:18.200 --> 52:20.200]  And it's 20 different stickers.
[52:20.200 --> 52:22.200]  And you go to Trump events
[52:22.200 --> 52:24.200]  and hand these out and put them over your mouth.
[52:24.200 --> 52:26.200]  It will become a big sensation
[52:26.200 --> 52:28.200]  and folks will ask, why are you wearing it?
[52:28.200 --> 52:30.200]  You just pull it off and explain to them
[52:30.200 --> 52:32.200]  and put it back on.
[52:32.200 --> 52:34.200]  And then say we want the president to do something
[52:34.200 --> 52:36.200]  about the censorship and about the suppression
[52:36.200 --> 52:38.200]  and about how AI is being used
[52:38.200 --> 52:40.200]  to track what we do in live time and control us.
[52:40.200 --> 52:42.200]  That's un-American. It's dangerous.
[52:42.200 --> 52:44.200]  It's what the Chai comms are doing.
[52:44.200 --> 52:46.200]  Everybody freaked out when China blocks emojis
[52:46.200 --> 52:48.200]  of Taiwan or Hong Kong being sent out.
[52:48.200 --> 52:50.200]  And then Apple had to admit it
[52:50.200 --> 52:52.200]  and had to apologize but went back to doing it again.
[52:52.200 --> 52:54.200]  We're being tested here.
[52:54.200 --> 53:00.200]  We have to say no to this.
[53:00.200 --> 53:02.200]  So,
[53:02.200 --> 53:04.200]  we'll be at a lot of the Trump events
[53:04.200 --> 53:08.200]  handing these out but it's a way to peaceful,
[53:08.200 --> 53:12.200]  a way to peacefully go in
[53:12.200 --> 53:14.200]  and not disrupt things
[53:14.200 --> 53:16.200]  but have everybody start asking you
[53:16.200 --> 53:18.200]  why are you upset.
[53:18.200 --> 53:20.200]  And by the way, I think the cute thing
[53:20.200 --> 53:22.200]  has been disinformation from the start
[53:22.200 --> 53:24.200]  which is obviously easy predictions like
[53:24.200 --> 53:26.200]  the vote for impeachment will be along party lines.
[53:26.200 --> 53:28.200]  That's very easy to predict.
[53:28.200 --> 53:30.200]  But I'm not going to fight with folks
[53:30.200 --> 53:32.200]  that are into Q and like it
[53:32.200 --> 53:34.200]  and like to research things.
[53:34.200 --> 53:36.200]  That's healthy to do.
[53:36.200 --> 53:38.200]  So, there's a sticker in the pack that says
[53:38.200 --> 53:40.200]  I am Q, infowars.com.
[53:40.200 --> 53:42.200]  Great. Q is wonderful.
[53:42.200 --> 53:44.200]  I've never been about in-fighting
[53:44.200 --> 53:46.200]  so I'm not going to get into in-fighting
[53:46.200 --> 53:48.200]  with the god of the universe, Q.
[53:48.200 --> 53:50.200]  So,
[53:50.200 --> 53:52.200]  I bow to Q.
[53:52.200 --> 53:54.200]  You are all powerful.
[53:54.200 --> 53:56.200]  And we just have the sticker there now
[53:56.200 --> 53:58.200]  that says it.
[53:58.200 --> 54:00.200]  I am Q, infowars.com.
[54:00.200 --> 54:02.200]  We love you. It's wonderful.
[54:02.200 --> 54:04.200]  Art Mueller is going to save us.
[54:04.200 --> 54:06.200]  But the point is I'm not fighting
[54:06.200 --> 54:08.200]  with folks that are into it
[54:08.200 --> 54:10.200]  and it creates community and that's great
[54:10.200 --> 54:12.200]  and that's what we're all about.
[54:12.200 --> 54:14.200]  They saw info wars as community.
[54:14.200 --> 54:16.200]  The globalists saw info wars as a communication system
[54:16.200 --> 54:18.200]  and as a nationalist, populist movement
[54:18.200 --> 54:20.200]  that could unify people
[54:20.200 --> 54:22.200]  to bring back Americana.
[54:22.200 --> 54:24.200]  That's why they demonized it. That's why they attacked it.
[54:24.200 --> 54:26.200]  That's why they shut it down.
[54:26.200 --> 54:28.200]  But they failed
[54:28.200 --> 54:30.200]  and now it's come back even stronger than ever.
[54:30.200 --> 54:32.200]  So, I believe info wars is a great rallying call.
[54:32.200 --> 54:34.200]  So is Trump.
[54:34.200 --> 54:36.200]  But Trump and info wars can come and go.
[54:36.200 --> 54:38.200]  The idea of just 1776
[54:38.200 --> 54:40.200]  and we the people
[54:40.200 --> 54:42.200]  and just the American flag itself
[54:42.200 --> 54:44.200]  and what it stands for, that really is our rallying point
[54:44.200 --> 54:46.200]  and should be our rallying call.
[54:46.200 --> 54:48.200]  Art, we'll start the second hour
[54:48.200 --> 54:50.200]  and I promise go to all of your calls.
[54:50.200 --> 54:52.200]  But we need action from Trump
[54:52.200 --> 54:54.200]  on the coordinated big tech
[54:54.200 --> 54:56.200]  suppression of nationalist
[54:56.200 --> 54:58.200]  Christians, conservatives, you name it
[54:58.200 --> 55:00.200]  and just, you know,
[55:00.200 --> 55:02.200]  all the things that are happening,
[55:02.200 --> 55:04.200]  all the things that are unfolding.
[55:04.200 --> 55:06.200]  This is concerted organized crime
[55:06.200 --> 55:08.200]  and that the Italian mafia
[55:08.200 --> 55:10.200]  was trying to tell people
[55:10.200 --> 55:12.200]  what they could say and do on some communication system.
[55:12.200 --> 55:14.200]  I assure you they would get indicted
[55:14.200 --> 55:16.200]  and do that.
[55:16.200 --> 55:18.200]  But when the Democrats and big tech
[55:18.200 --> 55:20.200]  are in bed with communist China
[55:20.200 --> 55:22.200]  literally enslaving their people
[55:22.200 --> 55:24.200]  and
[55:24.200 --> 55:26.200]  everywhere we're being told to race men
[55:26.200 --> 55:28.200]  out of the world and erase families
[55:28.200 --> 55:30.200]  and erase children, it's sick
[55:30.200 --> 55:32.200]  and it's dangerous and something needs to be done.
[55:32.200 --> 55:34.200]  We got callers from Finland
[55:34.200 --> 55:36.200]  and callers from all over the United States.
[55:36.200 --> 55:38.200]  So we're going to take all of your calls
[55:38.200 --> 55:40.200]  when we start the second hour
[55:40.200 --> 55:42.200]  here in just a few minutes
[55:42.200 --> 55:44.200]  and we've gotten into yet
[55:44.200 --> 55:46.200]  but watching Trump, whatever the deep state,
[55:46.200 --> 55:48.200]  is a beautiful thing.
[55:48.200 --> 55:50.200]  Separately, we've sold out
[55:50.200 --> 55:52.200]  of the 16 ounce immune gargle nano silver
[55:52.200 --> 55:54.200]  best you're going to find on this anywhere
[55:54.200 --> 55:56.200]  we private label it from the top firm
[55:56.200 --> 55:58.200]  in the United States.
[55:58.200 --> 56:00.200]  The three ounce will sell out within a week,
[56:00.200 --> 56:02.200]  the one ounce will sell out within a couple of days
[56:02.200 --> 56:04.200]  but it's still up there
[56:04.200 --> 56:06.200]  discounted right now. We also have the super
[56:06.200 --> 56:08.200]  silver
[56:08.200 --> 56:10.200]  tooth whitening and remineralization
[56:10.200 --> 56:12.200]  that has the nano silver in it as well
[56:12.200 --> 56:14.200]  front line of defense, so good
[56:14.200 --> 56:16.200]  for your teeth, so good for your body
[56:16.200 --> 56:18.200]  even though this will sell out at current rates
[56:18.200 --> 56:20.200]  in about two weeks and more does it come in for over a month
[56:20.200 --> 56:22.200]  I want you to have it, I want you to try it
[56:22.200 --> 56:24.200]  everybody else raises prices on things like this
[56:24.200 --> 56:26.200]  during a crisis like the coronavirus
[56:26.200 --> 56:28.200]  we are leaving it at 50% off
[56:28.200 --> 56:30.200]  on the super silver and on the super blue
[56:30.200 --> 56:32.200]  fluoride free toothpaste.
[56:32.200 --> 56:34.200]  The super blue has tea tree that's also antiviral
[56:34.200 --> 56:36.200]  antibacterial and I and I
[56:36.200 --> 56:38.200]  not just the nano silver
[56:38.200 --> 56:40.200]  nano silver
[56:40.200 --> 56:42.200]  the super silver whitening
[56:42.200 --> 56:44.200]  has the above ground
[56:44.200 --> 56:46.200]  coral calcium to remineralize
[56:46.200 --> 56:48.200]  the teeth and high quality nano silver
[56:48.200 --> 56:50.200]  it's fluoride free, look at that 100% reviews
[56:50.200 --> 56:52.200]  infowarstore.com
[56:52.200 --> 56:54.200]  so get yours today
[56:54.200 --> 56:56.200]  and support the info war and then finally
[56:56.200 --> 56:58.200]  my patriots the best
[56:58.200 --> 57:00.200]  storeable foods company in the nation it's the biggest now
[57:00.200 --> 57:02.200]  for 12 years because they deliver
[57:02.200 --> 57:04.200]  they have high quality in taste tests they're better
[57:04.200 --> 57:06.200]  than stuff you buy in stores for about a third
[57:06.200 --> 57:08.200]  of the world
[57:08.200 --> 57:10.200]  they're not just one middleman
[57:10.200 --> 57:12.200]  it's usually several there and it funds the info war
[57:12.200 --> 57:14.200]  they are still able to ship within 10 to 14 days
[57:14.200 --> 57:16.200]  they have plenty of food
[57:16.200 --> 57:18.200]  the problem is shipping around the clock
[57:18.200 --> 57:20.200]  and packaging is their problem
[57:20.200 --> 57:22.200]  but almost everybody else is sold out
[57:22.200 --> 57:24.200]  and or selling old food or gouging
[57:24.200 --> 57:26.200]  so it's smart in 2020 to ask for storeable food
[57:26.200 --> 57:28.200]  whether it's four weeks, three months supply
[57:28.200 --> 57:30.200]  six months supply, they have special diets
[57:30.200 --> 57:32.200]  they have it all right there
[57:32.200 --> 57:34.200]  I'd check it out in their full catalog at infowarstore.com
[57:34.200 --> 57:36.200]  they're in our computer system
[57:36.200 --> 57:38.200]  so you're basically ordering from them when you order from us
[57:38.200 --> 57:40.200]  infowarstore.com with their ready hour
[57:40.200 --> 57:42.200]  line of high quality storeable foods
[57:42.200 --> 57:44.200]  all right stay with us
[57:44.200 --> 57:46.200]  hour number two straight ahead
[57:48.200 --> 57:50.200]  almost all the other big storeable food companies
[57:50.200 --> 57:52.200]  are sold out of food
[57:52.200 --> 57:54.200]  but I know for a fact from sources to tell them people
[57:54.200 --> 57:56.200]  oh we've got it get your order in
[57:56.200 --> 57:58.200]  two weeks for delivery
[57:58.200 --> 58:00.200]  we follow this pattern over and over again
[58:00.200 --> 58:02.200]  I've been on radio for 25 years
[58:02.200 --> 58:04.200]  and I learned very quickly a lot of these companies
[58:04.200 --> 58:06.200]  they're fine during normal times
[58:06.200 --> 58:08.200]  but during a crisis they don't keep a bunch of food
[58:08.200 --> 58:10.200]  on hand because of inventory
[58:10.200 --> 58:12.200]  they'll still take your orders
[58:12.200 --> 58:14.200]  that's why about 11 years ago I found my Patriot supply
[58:14.200 --> 58:16.200]  now the biggest most trusted company
[58:16.200 --> 58:18.200]  out there and I became a private labeler for them
[58:18.200 --> 58:20.200]  because they actually have it on hand
[58:20.200 --> 58:22.200]  they actually give it delivered to you on time
[58:22.200 --> 58:24.200]  they do what they're going to say they're going to do
[58:24.200 --> 58:26.200]  because they want you as a customer over and over again
[58:26.200 --> 58:28.200]  and they're good people
[58:28.200 --> 58:30.200]  now they were saying seven to ten days before shipping
[58:30.200 --> 58:32.200]  they're going to get record level orders
[58:32.200 --> 58:34.200]  now it's 10 to 14
[58:34.200 --> 58:36.200]  because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus
[58:36.200 --> 58:38.200]  so get your orders at infowarstore.com
[58:38.200 --> 58:40.200]  get the best deals
[58:40.200 --> 58:42.200]  get it delivered first
[58:42.200 --> 58:44.200]  they're in our system it goes right to them
[58:44.200 --> 58:46.200]  then it funds the info as well
[58:46.200 --> 59:02.200]  thanks for watching
[59:02.200 --> 59:26.200]  now we're bringing you an all new version of your favorite formula to help you reach your energy peak
[59:26.200 --> 59:32.200]  ultra 12 from info wars life takes advantage of the most effective and expensive form of B12 available
[59:32.200 --> 59:35.200]  methylcobalamin to provide you with twice the B12
[59:35.200 --> 59:38.200]  ultra 12 can help make DNA, support the body's energy production
[59:38.200 --> 59:42.200]  and help produce healthy blood cells while assisting proper nervous system function
[59:42.200 --> 59:58.200]  help support your energy levels and take advantage of the superior form of B12 today with ultra 12
[59:58.200 --> 1:00:12.200]  that's right ladies and gentlemen trump is beginning to turn the tide against the globalist that's great
[1:00:12.200 --> 1:00:16.200]  and now we're going to be going to trump rally along with you
[1:00:16.200 --> 1:00:20.200]  and trying to get trump to take action against big tech censorship now the just department announced
[1:00:20.200 --> 1:00:24.200]  they're not going to do anything
[1:00:24.200 --> 1:00:32.200]  that's at least what their antitrust head said this is a short segment so I want to air a special report here
[1:00:32.200 --> 1:00:38.200]  and then when we come back in about five minutes I'm going to go to Savash I believe C of S
[1:00:38.200 --> 1:00:44.200]  from Finland, Justin, Tyler, Mitch, Matt, John, Jacob, Derek, Bill and so many others
[1:00:44.200 --> 1:00:52.200]  trump is beginning to take action it's very very exciting but the little poison lining of this beautiful cloud is that
[1:00:52.200 --> 1:00:58.200]  they're not going to go after the censorship but we're still going to fight we still have victory
[1:00:58.200 --> 1:01:04.200]  there are those that live their lives in victimology and that's a word that's in the encyclopedia we all know
[1:01:04.200 --> 1:01:10.200]  instead of a new word I'm about to coin into the realm and introduce today
[1:01:10.200 --> 1:01:14.200]  that could change the whole future of human destiny if it's adopted
[1:01:14.200 --> 1:01:20.200]  and we've put a lot of key coins out in the mind war and the soul war and the destiny war
[1:01:20.200 --> 1:01:24.200]  and that's victoryology
[1:01:28.200 --> 1:01:35.200]  so many people I know so many people I love define themselves by the attacks they're under
[1:01:35.200 --> 1:01:41.200]  and define themselves by how they're victims and oh look at me I'm a baby bird
[1:01:41.200 --> 1:01:44.200]  come to the nest and vomit in my mouth
[1:01:44.200 --> 1:01:50.200]  they never want to leave the nest and the millennials don't own anything they don't want to own anything they want communism
[1:01:50.200 --> 1:01:54.200]  they don't even know that communism will work like slaves 18 hours a day
[1:01:54.200 --> 1:01:59.200]  but they don't care because they're babies and we never pushed them out of the nest
[1:01:59.200 --> 1:02:03.200]  and I have people that are closer than I love
[1:02:03.200 --> 1:02:11.200]  I just can't get out of the victimology because that's the paradigm inflicted on them
[1:02:11.200 --> 1:02:16.200]  so I am pointing the term victoryology
[1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:23.200]  instead of being a victim be a victor
[1:02:23.200 --> 1:02:30.200]  and to be a victor you have to decide if somebody punches in the face that don't feel too bad
[1:02:30.200 --> 1:02:35.200]  you got to stop caring when things are hard because that's what makes you stronger
[1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:43.200]  instead of weaker because it's that mental capacity to stop giving in to fear that activates the genes
[1:02:43.200 --> 1:02:50.200]  that activates everything there is in your soul and your future and your destiny
[1:02:50.200 --> 1:02:55.200]  humans aren't born out of laying around on their asses
[1:02:55.200 --> 1:03:03.200]  we've been born out of conquering a world with lions and tigers and bears and mastodons
[1:03:03.200 --> 1:03:06.200]  and hyenas attacking us
[1:03:06.200 --> 1:03:14.200]  and hordes of other humans and giant wars and freezing atmospheres and giant volcanoes
[1:03:14.200 --> 1:03:19.200]  and huddling together in the cold night for warmth to survive
[1:03:19.200 --> 1:03:22.200]  we're the dominant species we built all this
[1:03:22.200 --> 1:03:29.200]  we're powerful and we're beautiful and we're ready to build the next level of civilization in God's plan
[1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:34.200]  but you must stop belling to those that want to make you a victim
[1:03:34.200 --> 1:03:39.200]  you must become the victor that you were born to be
[1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:43.200]  and not a victor over other weaker people
[1:03:43.200 --> 1:03:49.200]  but a victor in promoting ideas so powerful and so beautiful
[1:03:49.200 --> 1:03:52.200]  that despite the fact they're suppressed
[1:03:52.200 --> 1:03:55.200]  it doesn't matter if they're coming from Jimi Hendrix
[1:03:55.200 --> 1:03:59.200]  it doesn't matter if they're coming from Donald Trump
[1:03:59.200 --> 1:04:02.200]  it doesn't matter if it's coming from you a black man or a white woman
[1:04:02.200 --> 1:04:05.200]  or a young Hispanic person or somebody from China
[1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:09.200]  if you love God and you love justice and you love freedom
[1:04:09.200 --> 1:04:11.200]  and you want to build a pro-human future
[1:04:11.200 --> 1:04:15.200]  then you are an enemy of the New World Order and Satanism
[1:04:15.200 --> 1:04:21.200]  and you are an info warrior commited devil worship and the system
[1:04:21.200 --> 1:04:25.200]  and serving the corrupt technocracy will not animate you like this
[1:04:25.200 --> 1:04:29.200]  they want us shut down because we have the spirit
[1:04:29.200 --> 1:04:31.200]  I am jacked into the source
[1:04:31.200 --> 1:04:34.200]  I know the secret and I want to see you empowered
[1:04:34.200 --> 1:04:37.200]  but you have to believe in yourself first
[1:04:37.200 --> 1:04:39.200]  and you have to turn against the globalist
[1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:42.200]  and make that decision with God to open your heart to the truth
[1:04:42.200 --> 1:04:47.200]  and then the spirit of justice known as the Holy Spirit will flow into you
[1:04:47.200 --> 1:04:52.200]  and the beginning of a new system in your personal spiritual destiny
[1:04:52.200 --> 1:05:18.200]  with eternity will begin

[1:06:22.200 --> 1:06:26.200]  I'm Alex Jones your host on this live Wednesday of February 12, 2020
[1:06:26.200 --> 1:06:28.200]  global transmission
[1:06:28.200 --> 1:06:30.200]  we've entered hour number two
[1:06:30.200 --> 1:06:32.200]  Trump has launched the red storm
[1:06:32.200 --> 1:06:36.200]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of firings
[1:06:36.200 --> 1:06:38.200]  they're whining, they're complaining
[1:06:38.200 --> 1:06:40.200]  they've got their little boxes
[1:06:40.200 --> 1:06:42.200]  waddling out of the federal government
[1:06:42.200 --> 1:06:44.200]  at the national security council
[1:06:44.200 --> 1:06:46.200]  the state department, the justice department
[1:06:46.200 --> 1:06:48.200]  they were leakers, they were liars
[1:06:48.200 --> 1:06:50.200]  they were America haters
[1:06:50.200 --> 1:06:54.200]  and now finally Trump is becoming president
[1:06:54.200 --> 1:06:57.200]  with only 264 days left
[1:06:57.200 --> 1:07:01.200]  until the historic election
[1:07:01.200 --> 1:07:04.200]  we were worried he wouldn't take action
[1:07:04.200 --> 1:07:11.200]  but now he is
[1:07:11.200 --> 1:07:13.200]  alright see you Vash in Finland
[1:07:13.200 --> 1:07:17.200]  thanks for calling, you're on the year world wide, thank you
[1:07:17.200 --> 1:07:20.200]  thanks for taking my call Alex
[1:07:20.200 --> 1:07:22.200]  if I may plug first
[1:07:22.200 --> 1:07:25.200]  so I was thinking about one of your products
[1:07:25.200 --> 1:07:28.200]  that I've been using for myself for a while
[1:07:28.200 --> 1:07:30.200]  and it's been quite amazing
[1:07:30.200 --> 1:07:32.200]  it's bodies
[1:07:32.200 --> 1:07:37.200]  and I destroyed basically one of my risks
[1:07:37.200 --> 1:07:43.200]  at my training martial arts factory
[1:07:43.200 --> 1:07:46.200]  training martial arts and hurt your wrist
[1:07:46.200 --> 1:07:49.200]  and our bodies was amazing
[1:07:49.200 --> 1:07:52.200]  I recovered within three weeks
[1:07:52.200 --> 1:07:57.200]  and my mom was recently diagnosed with arthritis
[1:07:57.200 --> 1:08:01.200]  and she's been having knee pains for years
[1:08:01.200 --> 1:08:04.200]  and your body was just amazing
[1:08:04.200 --> 1:08:06.200]  and she told me very recently
[1:08:06.200 --> 1:08:09.200]  that she simply doesn't feel pain anymore
[1:08:09.200 --> 1:08:11.200]  I mean it doesn't feel as good as new
[1:08:11.200 --> 1:08:14.200]  but it doesn't feel painful either
[1:08:14.200 --> 1:08:17.200]  she just got rid of all of that
[1:08:17.200 --> 1:08:19.200]  well it works for me better than Advil
[1:08:19.200 --> 1:08:21.200]  but it does take a few days to build up
[1:08:21.200 --> 1:08:23.200]  it doesn't work right away
[1:08:23.200 --> 1:08:25.200]  and my wife, I told the story about a year ago
[1:08:25.200 --> 1:08:27.200]  she would have hip surgery
[1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:30.200]  her hip hurts so bad for playing tennis competitively for so long
[1:08:30.200 --> 1:08:32.200]  and she goes wait a minute
[1:08:32.200 --> 1:08:35.200]  these turmeric pills are twice as big and strong as yours
[1:08:35.200 --> 1:08:37.200]  but yours works better
[1:08:37.200 --> 1:08:41.200]  and I said honey because the FDA makes you just call it turmeric
[1:08:41.200 --> 1:08:43.200]  we have an expensive turmeric extract
[1:08:43.200 --> 1:08:46.200]  the strongest one that we can find that's certified
[1:08:46.200 --> 1:08:48.200]  so it says turmeric on the bottle
[1:08:48.200 --> 1:08:50.200]  but it's not turmeric
[1:08:50.200 --> 1:08:52.200]  it's a turmeric curcuminoid extract
[1:08:52.200 --> 1:08:55.200]  and so that's why bodies it works really good
[1:08:55.200 --> 1:08:57.200]  and turmeric in general is amazing
[1:08:57.200 --> 1:09:01.200]  but the average turmeric out there has 5% curcuminoid
[1:09:01.200 --> 1:09:03.200]  this has 95%
[1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:05.200]  this is the strongest curcuminoid
[1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:07.200]  we can find, in fact
[1:09:07.200 --> 1:09:09.200]  this is a top company that puts us out for us
[1:09:09.200 --> 1:09:12.200]  they said we don't know anyone else that puts one out this strong
[1:09:12.200 --> 1:09:14.200]  so they specially make it
[1:09:14.200 --> 1:09:17.200]  the other highest one is like 87%
[1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:19.200]  another company puts out 87%
[1:09:19.200 --> 1:09:22.200]  this extracts 95% curcuminoid
[1:09:22.200 --> 1:09:24.200]  so that's why it has such a big effect
[1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:27.200]  so I'm glad you and your mother have liked it
[1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:30.200]  yeah most definitely
[1:09:30.200 --> 1:09:33.200]  all of your other products are very amazing
[1:09:33.200 --> 1:09:36.200]  for the first time I bought your quail oil
[1:09:36.200 --> 1:09:38.200]  and I really have to tell you
[1:09:38.200 --> 1:09:40.200]  my mental clarity is just insane
[1:09:40.200 --> 1:09:42.200]  and I think sleeping so much better
[1:09:42.200 --> 1:09:44.200]  just like you've been saying
[1:09:44.200 --> 1:09:46.200]  that you can't get out of bed
[1:09:46.200 --> 1:09:48.200]  it's exactly like that
[1:09:48.200 --> 1:09:50.200]  I really like it most definitely
[1:09:50.200 --> 1:09:52.200]  it's definitely scary
[1:09:52.200 --> 1:09:54.200]  we're sold out of the quail oil right now
[1:09:54.200 --> 1:09:56.200]  but our ultimate fish oil is part quail oil
[1:09:56.200 --> 1:09:58.200]  and I'll just be honest
[1:09:58.200 --> 1:10:00.200]  it's different strokes for different folks
[1:10:00.200 --> 1:10:02.200]  higher dose, the quail oil is better for me
[1:10:02.200 --> 1:10:04.200]  but yeah if I want to have fun
[1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:06.200]  I'll take 3 quail oil and go to sleep
[1:10:06.200 --> 1:10:08.200]  and then it's just, it's crazy
[1:10:08.200 --> 1:10:10.200]  because it just makes life so much better
[1:10:12.200 --> 1:10:14.200]  it also thins the blood
[1:10:14.200 --> 1:10:16.200]  which again is so critical
[1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:18.200]  to not having heart attacks as everybody knows
[1:10:18.200 --> 1:10:20.200]  oh yeah
[1:10:20.200 --> 1:10:22.200]  I mean it's better to take supplements
[1:10:22.200 --> 1:10:24.200]  the older you get to take care of your body
[1:10:24.200 --> 1:10:26.200]  and expect good things
[1:10:26.200 --> 1:10:28.200]  if you don't take care of your body
[1:10:28.200 --> 1:10:30.200]  you can't really expect anything good out of your body
[1:10:30.200 --> 1:10:32.200]  well you're up there in Finland
[1:10:32.200 --> 1:10:34.200]  that's actually where
[1:10:34.200 --> 1:10:36.200]  that's where quail oil actually comes from
[1:10:36.200 --> 1:10:38.200]  we've got some of the cleanest, best
[1:10:38.200 --> 1:10:40.200]  quail and stuff is out of those fjords up there
[1:10:42.200 --> 1:10:44.200]  oh yeah we have all of that stuff here
[1:10:44.200 --> 1:10:46.200]  but it's unfortunately very hard
[1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:48.200]  to trust any good companies here
[1:10:48.200 --> 1:10:50.200]  like the biggest companies that are out here
[1:10:50.200 --> 1:10:52.200]  that have the biggest exposure
[1:10:52.200 --> 1:10:54.200]  are the absolute worst companies
[1:10:54.200 --> 1:10:56.200]  they put out the worst stuff
[1:10:56.200 --> 1:10:58.200]  oh I know, I know, I mean they'll tell me
[1:10:58.200 --> 1:11:00.200]  cause I've talked to big companies
[1:11:00.200 --> 1:11:02.200]  they'll do 90% of their money is in marketing
[1:11:02.200 --> 1:11:04.200]  instead of in the actual product
[1:11:04.200 --> 1:11:06.200]  and then they'll just put out the lowest
[1:11:06.200 --> 1:11:08.200]  grade crap that people are not caring
[1:11:08.200 --> 1:11:10.200]  but again that's what Satanism is about
[1:11:10.200 --> 1:11:12.200]  like I could not
[1:11:12.200 --> 1:11:14.200]  put out
[1:11:14.200 --> 1:11:16.200]  something that I thought wasn't the best
[1:11:16.200 --> 1:11:18.200]  I mean take the storeable food
[1:11:18.200 --> 1:11:20.200]  like I've said you can find stuff
[1:11:20.200 --> 1:11:22.200]  five times more expensive that tastes gourmet
[1:11:22.200 --> 1:11:24.200]  but for the nexus
[1:11:24.200 --> 1:11:26.200]  of how much you spend
[1:11:26.200 --> 1:11:28.200]  versus the quality you get
[1:11:28.200 --> 1:11:30.200]  this is the best stuff out there
[1:11:30.200 --> 1:11:32.200]  but other than food
[1:11:32.200 --> 1:11:34.200]  cause you can definitely spend more money
[1:11:34.200 --> 1:11:36.200]  and get through the taste better
[1:11:36.200 --> 1:11:38.200]  when it comes to supplements
[1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:40.200]  we are bringing you the very best we can
[1:11:40.200 --> 1:11:42.200]  but I'm gonna stop belaboring it
[1:11:42.200 --> 1:11:44.200]  thank you for the plug sir, God bless you
[1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:46.200]  what is your view on Trump the mass firings
[1:11:46.200 --> 1:11:48.200]  well my view is
[1:11:48.200 --> 1:11:50.200]  what took so long
[1:11:50.200 --> 1:11:52.200]  I mean I'm glad that all of this happened
[1:11:52.200 --> 1:11:54.200]  right now but what took so long
[1:11:54.200 --> 1:11:56.200]  and the second is that I'm just thinking
[1:11:56.200 --> 1:11:58.200]  that is he gonna now start
[1:11:58.200 --> 1:12:00.200]  gonna go after all these criminal people
[1:12:00.200 --> 1:12:02.200]  Hillary Clinton
[1:12:02.200 --> 1:12:04.200]  and Obama and all of these people
[1:12:04.200 --> 1:12:06.200]  that have been doing all of these things
[1:12:06.200 --> 1:12:08.200]  for them for years
[1:12:08.200 --> 1:12:10.200]  that they've been getting away with
[1:12:10.200 --> 1:12:12.200]  like what's gonna happen with that
[1:12:12.200 --> 1:12:14.200]  is he gonna finally start going after
[1:12:14.200 --> 1:12:16.200]  all of these people
[1:12:16.200 --> 1:12:18.200]  you know Trump acts tough
[1:12:18.200 --> 1:12:20.200]  but he really is a pragmatist
[1:12:20.200 --> 1:12:22.200]  and doesn't wanna destroy these people
[1:12:22.200 --> 1:12:24.200]  he just wants them to go away
[1:12:24.200 --> 1:12:26.200]  but every time I've been able to talk to the president to the point of him being annoyed
[1:12:26.200 --> 1:12:28.200]  I go sir
[1:12:28.200 --> 1:12:30.200]  please stop bragging when I tell these stories
[1:12:30.200 --> 1:12:32.200]  he knows these are true
[1:12:32.200 --> 1:12:34.200]  I go sir please stop telling me how I'm a good great guy
[1:12:34.200 --> 1:12:36.200]  just stop these people
[1:12:36.200 --> 1:12:38.200]  they're trying to destroy me and my family and you
[1:12:38.200 --> 1:12:40.200]  you must go on the attack
[1:12:40.200 --> 1:12:42.200]  you must go on the attack
[1:12:42.200 --> 1:12:44.200]  and now he's doing it
[1:12:44.200 --> 1:12:46.200]  and so it's good news
[1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:48.200]  he just can't believe that
[1:12:48.200 --> 1:12:50.200]  he's gonna leave them alone when he can send them all to prison
[1:12:50.200 --> 1:12:52.200]  but they don't respect him
[1:12:52.200 --> 1:12:54.200]  they're gonna respect him now
[1:12:54.200 --> 1:12:56.200]  I believe he's getting really ready to go after him
[1:12:56.200 --> 1:12:58.200]  it seems like he really doesn't see
[1:12:58.200 --> 1:13:00.200]  that these people are actually
[1:13:00.200 --> 1:13:02.200]  trying to remove him
[1:13:02.200 --> 1:13:04.200]  it was really hard
[1:13:04.200 --> 1:13:06.200]  trying to work with them
[1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:08.200]  and make it actually work
[1:13:08.200 --> 1:13:10.200]  but it's not gonna happen
[1:13:10.200 --> 1:13:12.200]  when people are simply corrupt
[1:13:12.200 --> 1:13:14.200]  they're not just gonna all of a sudden start working with you
[1:13:14.200 --> 1:13:16.200]  and if you've been around criminals
[1:13:16.200 --> 1:13:18.200]  they're dumb, they have confidence but they're dumb
[1:13:18.200 --> 1:13:20.200]  and Trump saw how close he got
[1:13:20.200 --> 1:13:22.200]  to being impeached
[1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:24.200]  and he knows they could win the Senate
[1:13:24.200 --> 1:13:26.200]  and he's feeling him seeing only a few votes away
[1:13:26.200 --> 1:13:28.200]  from being impeached
[1:13:28.200 --> 1:13:30.200]  almost had to have the Vice President come in
[1:13:30.200 --> 1:13:32.200]  and save his ass in the tideboat
[1:13:32.200 --> 1:13:34.200]  so yeah, Trump finally gets it
[1:13:34.200 --> 1:13:36.200]  he's like wait, doing a good job wasn't enough
[1:13:36.200 --> 1:13:38.200]  they really don't want to share power
[1:13:38.200 --> 1:13:40.200]  no, they don't want to share power
[1:13:40.200 --> 1:13:42.200]  they want total control, Trump
[1:13:44.200 --> 1:13:46.200]  I'm very happy to see that
[1:13:46.200 --> 1:13:48.200]  he's actually doing something now
[1:13:48.200 --> 1:13:50.200]  this is the very first step
[1:13:50.200 --> 1:13:52.200]  at least that he's gonna take
[1:13:52.200 --> 1:13:54.200]  towards these people
[1:13:54.200 --> 1:13:56.200]  and it's gonna scare the living
[1:13:56.200 --> 1:13:58.200]  bandits out of them
[1:13:58.200 --> 1:14:00.200]  I agree with you, what do you think they do next?
[1:14:02.200 --> 1:14:04.200]  well, they're gonna go into full panic mode
[1:14:04.200 --> 1:14:06.200]  and they're gonna try and pull
[1:14:06.200 --> 1:14:08.200]  something out of their hat
[1:14:08.200 --> 1:14:10.200]  and it's not gonna be pretty
[1:14:10.200 --> 1:14:12.200]  and it's gonna be
[1:14:12.200 --> 1:14:14.200]  probably something very unexpected
[1:14:14.200 --> 1:14:16.200]  but I really honestly can't say
[1:14:16.200 --> 1:14:18.200]  I love Pelosi saying
[1:14:18.200 --> 1:14:20.200]  it's political interference
[1:14:20.200 --> 1:14:22.200]  to say
[1:14:22.200 --> 1:14:24.200]  I think this sentence is too big
[1:14:24.200 --> 1:14:26.200]  when he has the executive power
[1:14:26.200 --> 1:14:28.200]  to pardon people
[1:14:28.200 --> 1:14:30.200]  he 100% has that power
[1:14:30.200 --> 1:14:32.200]  but they just don't want him to have the basic power
[1:14:32.200 --> 1:14:34.200]  of a President
[1:14:34.200 --> 1:14:36.200]  God bless you sir, I appreciate your call
[1:14:36.200 --> 1:14:38.200]  alright, I got a minute
[1:14:38.200 --> 1:14:40.200]  before break so I can't do justice to a caller
[1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:42.200]  but let's do three callers next segment
[1:14:42.200 --> 1:14:44.200]  let's get a lot of callers because they're all amazing
[1:14:44.200 --> 1:14:46.200]  but separately, yeah
[1:14:46.200 --> 1:14:48.200]  why wouldn't I want to
[1:14:48.200 --> 1:14:50.200]  put out a turmeric formula
[1:14:50.200 --> 1:14:52.200]  that gets you the best response
[1:14:54.200 --> 1:14:56.200]  because I love that when my wife came to me
[1:14:56.200 --> 1:14:58.200]  and she said
[1:14:58.200 --> 1:15:00.200]  I take one of these, it does the same as three of these
[1:15:00.200 --> 1:15:02.200]  why is that?
[1:15:02.200 --> 1:15:04.200]  because it says it's lower turmeric on ours
[1:15:04.200 --> 1:15:06.200]  and I explained to her, I said baby
[1:15:06.200 --> 1:15:08.200]  they don't let you say turmeric extract
[1:15:08.200 --> 1:15:10.200]  you just call it turmeric on the back
[1:15:10.200 --> 1:15:12.200]  but it's turmeric extract
[1:15:12.200 --> 1:15:14.200]  so there you go ladies and gentlemen
[1:15:14.200 --> 1:15:16.200]  ultimate turmeric formula bodies
[1:15:16.200 --> 1:15:18.200]  by the way that's sold out though
[1:15:18.200 --> 1:15:20.200]  we're like up here
[1:15:20.200 --> 1:15:22.200]  we're up here plucking something sold out
[1:15:24.200 --> 1:15:26.200]  because we have to get the purest
[1:15:26.200 --> 1:15:28.200]  end to it, it has to pass all the testing
[1:15:28.200 --> 1:15:30.200]  and they've not been able to
[1:15:30.200 --> 1:15:32.200]  even get turmeric clean enough to even make a run of it
[1:15:32.200 --> 1:15:34.200]  again that's why we don't cut
[1:15:34.200 --> 1:15:36.200]  corners to get you the quality
[1:15:36.200 --> 1:15:38.200]  but it means stuff's sold out sometimes
[1:15:38.200 --> 1:15:40.200]  but we do have a super blue
[1:15:40.200 --> 1:15:42.200]  and the super silver whitening toothpaste
[1:15:42.200 --> 1:15:44.200]  with a nano silver that we'll sell out soon
[1:15:44.200 --> 1:15:46.200]  and that funds the operation
[1:15:46.200 --> 1:15:48.200]  in FullerStore.com
[1:15:48.200 --> 1:15:50.200]  enough plugging for the hour, I'm done
[1:15:50.200 --> 1:15:52.200]  collars, no more plugging products
[1:15:52.200 --> 1:15:54.200]  we're going to go to your politics

[1:16:24.200 --> 1:16:26.200]  how much healthier I look

[1:16:28.200 --> 1:16:30.200]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone
[1:16:30.200 --> 1:16:32.200]  anybody over 40 in the North American continent
[1:16:32.200 --> 1:16:34.200]  should be using this product
[1:16:34.200 --> 1:16:36.200]  as a preventative to keep their
[1:16:36.200 --> 1:17:02.200]  vascular system healthy
[1:17:02.200 --> 1:17:08.200]  we're going to go to your politics
[1:17:08.200 --> 1:17:30.200]  here's how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America
[1:17:30.200 --> 1:17:32.200]  deposit it into your bank account

[1:17:44.200 --> 1:17:46.200]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners
[1:17:46.200 --> 1:17:48.200]  consult with financial professionals
[1:17:48.200 --> 1:17:50.200]  before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security
[1:17:50.200 --> 1:17:52.200]  which requires an offering document
[1:17:52.200 --> 1:17:54.200]  three weeks ago we told you
[1:17:54.200 --> 1:17:56.200]  the Pentagon had set up secret quarantine centers
[1:17:56.200 --> 1:17:58.200]  for the coronavirus and that they believed
[1:17:58.200 --> 1:18:00.200]  it was much more serious than we were being told
[1:18:00.200 --> 1:18:02.200]  now we know that that is the case
[1:18:02.200 --> 1:18:04.200]  and we know the federal government
[1:18:04.200 --> 1:18:06.200]  and major corporations have been buying up
[1:18:06.200 --> 1:18:08.200]  all the major storeable food supplies
[1:18:08.200 --> 1:18:10.200]  around the country almost everyone else
[1:18:10.200 --> 1:18:12.200]  is sold out
[1:18:12.200 --> 1:18:14.200]  but our supplier, my patriot
[1:18:14.200 --> 1:18:16.200]  at infowarstore.com
[1:18:16.200 --> 1:18:18.200]  still has their entire line
[1:18:18.200 --> 1:18:20.200]  of information
[1:18:20.200 --> 1:18:22.200]  and it's fresh
[1:18:22.200 --> 1:18:24.200]  that's why you have to wait 10-14 days
[1:18:24.200 --> 1:18:26.200]  for it to get delivered
[1:18:26.200 --> 1:18:28.200]  not because they don't have the food
[1:18:28.200 --> 1:18:30.200]  but because they've got a package
[1:18:30.200 --> 1:18:32.200]  and their factories are going 24
[1:18:32.200 --> 1:18:34.200]  hours a day
[1:18:34.200 --> 1:18:36.200]  high quality fresh food
[1:18:36.200 --> 1:18:38.200]  the best package systems taste great
[1:18:38.200 --> 1:18:40.200]  protects you and your family and funds the info war
[1:18:40.200 --> 1:18:42.200]  you just got to get the orders in
[1:18:42.200 --> 1:18:44.200]  until they extended out even more
[1:18:44.200 --> 1:18:46.200]  which could happen
[1:18:46.200 --> 1:18:48.200]  lock in your orders now and sure you get it
[1:18:48.200 --> 1:18:50.200]  at infowarstore.com today
[1:18:50.200 --> 1:18:52.200]  if you are receiving this transmission
[1:18:52.200 --> 1:18:54.200]  you are the resistance
[1:18:56.200 --> 1:18:58.200]  I have confirmed with high level
[1:18:58.200 --> 1:19:00.200]  sources that President Trump
[1:19:00.200 --> 1:19:02.200]  is intending to either pardon
[1:19:02.200 --> 1:19:04.200]  Roger Stone after his sentencing
[1:19:04.200 --> 1:19:06.200]  or give him clemency
[1:19:06.200 --> 1:19:08.200]  saying the conviction stands
[1:19:08.200 --> 1:19:10.200]  but you now basically don't go to jail
[1:19:10.200 --> 1:19:12.200]  either way this is incredibly good news
[1:19:12.200 --> 1:19:14.200]  but let's not forget
[1:19:14.200 --> 1:19:16.200]  Julian Assange
[1:19:16.200 --> 1:19:18.200]  one of the black marks on Trump
[1:19:18.200 --> 1:19:20.200]  is that he famously said
[1:19:20.200 --> 1:19:22.200]  I don't know who got the emails
[1:19:22.200 --> 1:19:24.200]  I don't know where they came from
[1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:26.200]  the Russians, a fat dude in his mom's basement
[1:19:26.200 --> 1:19:28.200]  whoever's got them release them
[1:19:28.200 --> 1:19:30.200]  it's about Hillary committing a crime
[1:19:30.200 --> 1:19:32.200]  not who has the emails don't change the subject
[1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:34.200]  well Julian Assange undoubtedly took Trump
[1:19:34.200 --> 1:19:36.200]  over the top
[1:19:36.200 --> 1:19:38.200]  the WikiLeaks exposed the deep state
[1:19:38.200 --> 1:19:40.200]  the man is a hero
[1:19:40.200 --> 1:19:42.200]  Daniel Ellsberg was a hero
[1:19:42.200 --> 1:19:44.200]  well Assange is even a bigger hero
[1:19:44.200 --> 1:19:46.200]  President Trump do the right thing
[1:19:46.200 --> 1:19:48.200]  and ask the British to release Julian Assange
[1:19:48.200 --> 1:19:50.200]  and give him a medal
[1:19:50.200 --> 1:19:52.200]  President Trump you must release Julian Assange
[1:19:52.200 --> 1:19:54.200]  Free Julian Assange
[1:19:54.200 --> 1:20:16.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:20:16.200 --> 1:20:18.200]  The answer to 1984
[1:20:18.200 --> 1:20:20.200]  is 1776
[1:20:20.200 --> 1:20:24.200]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:20:24.200 --> 1:20:26.200]  so the red storm is here
[1:20:26.200 --> 1:20:28.200]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of firings
[1:20:28.200 --> 1:20:30.200]  a lot of them delicious
[1:20:30.200 --> 1:20:32.200]  Trump with Raw's nomination
[1:20:32.200 --> 1:20:34.200]  of former U.S. Attorney
[1:20:34.200 --> 1:20:36.200]  for Treasury Post
[1:20:36.200 --> 1:20:38.200]  Trump's now paying attention
[1:20:38.200 --> 1:20:40.200]  to how his own staff
[1:20:40.200 --> 1:20:42.200]  brings in people like the fake
[1:20:42.200 --> 1:20:44.200]  prosecutor over stone
[1:20:44.200 --> 1:20:46.200]  who engage in all those incredible activities
[1:20:46.200 --> 1:20:48.200]  that investigated myself
[1:20:48.200 --> 1:20:50.200]  my father
[1:20:50.200 --> 1:20:52.200]  that leaked information of the press
[1:20:52.200 --> 1:20:54.200]  to harass us
[1:20:54.200 --> 1:20:56.200]  this monster this un-American pig
[1:20:58.200 --> 1:21:00.200]  oversaw various high profile cases
[1:21:00.200 --> 1:21:02.200]  including those against Trump campaign
[1:21:02.200 --> 1:21:04.200]  advisor Roger Stone
[1:21:04.200 --> 1:21:06.200]  well they gave her the nomination
[1:21:06.200 --> 1:21:08.200]  for number three of the Treasury
[1:21:08.200 --> 1:21:10.200]  she quit her just department job
[1:21:10.200 --> 1:21:12.200]  for it and then guess what
[1:21:12.200 --> 1:21:14.200]  the nomination was withdrawn
[1:21:14.200 --> 1:21:16.200]  isn't that just perfect
[1:21:16.200 --> 1:21:18.200]  and of course that's
[1:21:18.200 --> 1:21:20.200]  the way all of this ends up
[1:21:20.200 --> 1:21:22.200]  unfolding Jesse Liu
[1:21:22.200 --> 1:21:24.200]  we're taking your phone calls
[1:21:24.200 --> 1:21:26.200]  right now
[1:21:26.200 --> 1:21:28.200]  let's go ahead and go to Bill in Iowa
[1:21:28.200 --> 1:21:30.200]  Bill you're on the air thanks for calling
[1:21:30.200 --> 1:21:32.200]  hi Mr. Jones can you hear me
[1:21:32.200 --> 1:21:34.200]  I can brother thanks for calling
[1:21:34.200 --> 1:21:36.200]  great thank you
[1:21:36.200 --> 1:21:38.200]  I want to first of all say
[1:21:38.200 --> 1:21:40.200]  long time listener first time caller
[1:21:40.200 --> 1:21:42.200]  you woke me up in so many ways
[1:21:42.200 --> 1:21:44.200]  because of you
[1:21:44.200 --> 1:21:46.200]  I got my patriotism back
[1:21:46.200 --> 1:21:48.200]  love my country would die for it
[1:21:48.200 --> 1:21:50.200]  I think it's good right now
[1:21:50.200 --> 1:21:52.200]  what Trump is doing is getting involved
[1:21:52.200 --> 1:21:54.200]  on little scum bags there
[1:21:54.200 --> 1:21:56.200]  what he I think what he really needs to do
[1:21:56.200 --> 1:21:58.200]  is sort of getting the military police involved
[1:21:58.200 --> 1:22:00.200]  is have one big sweep
[1:22:00.200 --> 1:22:02.200]  get rid of all these corrupt people
[1:22:02.200 --> 1:22:04.200]  on the downside of that
[1:22:04.200 --> 1:22:06.200]  is you know when you
[1:22:06.200 --> 1:22:08.200]  have a rapid raccoon you know cornered in a
[1:22:08.200 --> 1:22:10.200]  shed somewhere
[1:22:10.200 --> 1:22:12.200]  that's going to fight back
[1:22:12.200 --> 1:22:14.200]  and do everything it's can to get you back
[1:22:14.200 --> 1:22:16.200]  and I just have a feeling that
[1:22:16.200 --> 1:22:18.200]  they're going to strike back with something big
[1:22:18.200 --> 1:22:20.200]  and huge and it's not going to be pretty
[1:22:20.200 --> 1:22:22.200]  no I agree with you
[1:22:22.200 --> 1:22:24.200]  well this coronavirus could take the economy
[1:22:24.200 --> 1:22:26.200]  the numbers are coming in it's definitely hurt the economy
[1:22:26.200 --> 1:22:28.200]  not helped it but pulling back from that
[1:22:30.200 --> 1:22:32.200]  the globalists know
[1:22:32.200 --> 1:22:34.200]  that they're running out of time
[1:22:34.200 --> 1:22:36.200]  and they are going to pull some major curveballs
[1:22:36.200 --> 1:22:38.200]  and Trump should be aware of that
[1:22:38.200 --> 1:22:40.200]  and I think he wants to stir up trouble
[1:22:40.200 --> 1:22:42.200]  they're not going to stop
[1:22:42.200 --> 1:22:44.200]  because they were put in power
[1:22:44.200 --> 1:22:46.200]  by other people these are minions
[1:22:46.200 --> 1:22:48.200]  these are followers
[1:22:48.200 --> 1:22:50.200]  and so they can't help but work against
[1:22:50.200 --> 1:22:52.200]  Trump because they were put there because
[1:22:52.200 --> 1:22:54.200]  there's dirt on them
[1:22:54.200 --> 1:22:56.200]  and so that's why Trump can do nothing
[1:22:56.200 --> 1:22:58.200]  but cut them out of the country
[1:22:58.200 --> 1:23:00.200]  he's got to remove them from the power structure
[1:23:00.200 --> 1:23:02.200]  and you're going to hear yelling
[1:23:02.200 --> 1:23:04.200]  and squealing and all of this
[1:23:04.200 --> 1:23:06.200]  but not going after them
[1:23:06.200 --> 1:23:08.200]  and he's going to organize and launch a new attack
[1:23:08.200 --> 1:23:10.200]  right and I agree
[1:23:10.200 --> 1:23:12.200]  and as far as the censorship
[1:23:12.200 --> 1:23:14.200]  with the big tech companies
[1:23:14.200 --> 1:23:16.200]  and everything like that
[1:23:16.200 --> 1:23:18.200]  Trump doesn't do nothing right now
[1:23:18.200 --> 1:23:20.200]  I mean
[1:23:20.200 --> 1:23:22.200]  there's a good chance that he might not be president again
[1:23:22.200 --> 1:23:24.200]  if they don't take him out before then
[1:23:24.200 --> 1:23:26.200]  well that's exactly what
[1:23:26.200 --> 1:23:28.200]  what Professor Epstein, Robert Epstein documented
[1:23:28.200 --> 1:23:30.200]  is that Google
[1:23:30.200 --> 1:23:32.200]  can only send out election alerts
[1:23:32.200 --> 1:23:34.200]  to Democrats
[1:23:34.200 --> 1:23:36.200]  million voters right there
[1:23:36.200 --> 1:23:38.200]  this is election meddling
[1:23:38.200 --> 1:23:40.200]  this isn't old companies do what they want
[1:23:40.200 --> 1:23:42.200]  what if AT&T
[1:23:42.200 --> 1:23:44.200]  in 1980 wouldn't let Republicans use the phone
[1:23:44.200 --> 1:23:46.200]  Reagan would have lost
[1:23:46.200 --> 1:23:48.200]  that's what they do
[1:23:48.200 --> 1:23:50.200]  this isn't about companies can do what they want
[1:23:50.200 --> 1:23:52.200]  this is the new mode of communication
[1:23:52.200 --> 1:23:54.200]  problem is
[1:23:54.200 --> 1:23:56.200]  it's a good thing in ways because he's got some old instincts
[1:23:56.200 --> 1:23:58.200]  but
[1:23:58.200 --> 1:24:00.200]  Trump does all his stuff on a phone
[1:24:00.200 --> 1:24:02.200]  and doesn't get the internet
[1:24:02.200 --> 1:24:04.200]  he thinks it's like a side thing
[1:24:04.200 --> 1:24:06.200]  he doesn't know that the internet communication
[1:24:06.200 --> 1:24:08.200]  is 20 times bigger than mainstream media
[1:24:08.200 --> 1:24:10.200]  he just doesn't get that
[1:24:10.200 --> 1:24:12.200]  it's the whole ball game
[1:24:12.200 --> 1:24:14.200]  and so it's a real blind spot thank you so much Bill
[1:24:14.200 --> 1:24:16.200]  Derek in California
[1:24:16.200 --> 1:24:18.200]  thanks for holding and we'll go to Jacob and others
[1:24:18.200 --> 1:24:20.200]  Derek thank you go ahead
[1:24:20.200 --> 1:24:22.200]  yes sir nice to hear from you Alex
[1:24:22.200 --> 1:24:24.200]  yes sir
[1:24:24.200 --> 1:24:26.200]  I just want to say that I agree with the caller
[1:24:26.200 --> 1:24:28.200]  I think it's time
[1:24:28.200 --> 1:24:30.200]  to put the military in here
[1:24:30.200 --> 1:24:32.200]  it's time to just go ahead and get it going
[1:24:32.200 --> 1:24:34.200]  you know we
[1:24:34.200 --> 1:24:36.200]  we can't deal with these people
[1:24:36.200 --> 1:24:38.200]  in the court system we just went through
[1:24:38.200 --> 1:24:40.200]  what Trump just went through with
[1:24:40.200 --> 1:24:42.200]  you know his old escapades
[1:24:42.200 --> 1:24:44.200]  and you know they're not going to stop
[1:24:44.200 --> 1:24:46.200]  here's the deal they were Americans doing it
[1:24:46.200 --> 1:24:48.200]  it's one thing but they are chai-com
[1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:50.200]  and globalist funded as an ethos
[1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:52.200]  they say America shouldn't exist
[1:24:52.200 --> 1:24:54.200]  so when you're a citizen that says the country shouldn't exist
[1:24:54.200 --> 1:24:56.200]  and you're working to bankrupt it
[1:24:56.200 --> 1:24:58.200]  and you're working to suppress other people
[1:24:58.200 --> 1:25:00.200]  and all these Bernie Sanders people
[1:25:00.200 --> 1:25:02.200]  said they want to put us in death camps
[1:25:02.200 --> 1:25:04.200]  yeah they're like the Nazi party you just outlawed
[1:25:04.200 --> 1:25:06.200]  I mean it's just listen I'm not an authoritarian
[1:25:06.200 --> 1:25:08.200]  I'm the opposite of that they brought
[1:25:08.200 --> 1:25:10.200]  the authoritarianism they brought
[1:25:10.200 --> 1:25:12.200]  the cancer they brought the war they brought
[1:25:12.200 --> 1:25:14.200]  and you're right these aren't Americans
[1:25:14.200 --> 1:25:16.200]  and so how
[1:25:16.200 --> 1:25:18.200]  do you address something with normal
[1:25:18.200 --> 1:25:20.200]  means normal measures
[1:25:20.200 --> 1:25:22.200]  when it's not normal
[1:25:22.200 --> 1:25:24.200]  well they already committed treason
[1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:26.200]  here we're past that
[1:25:26.200 --> 1:25:28.200]  you know from Obama
[1:25:28.200 --> 1:25:30.200]  all the way up to Hillary
[1:25:30.200 --> 1:25:32.200]  these people have committed treason
[1:25:32.200 --> 1:25:34.200]  and we can't go to the courts
[1:25:34.200 --> 1:25:36.200]  and try these people we need military
[1:25:36.200 --> 1:25:38.200]  tribunal
[1:25:38.200 --> 1:25:40.200]  plain and simple
[1:25:40.200 --> 1:25:42.200]  actually it's real
[1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:44.200]  when a political system
[1:25:44.200 --> 1:25:46.200]  works in unison
[1:25:46.200 --> 1:25:48.200]  to destroy a country
[1:25:48.200 --> 1:25:50.200]  you don't put them on criminal trial
[1:25:50.200 --> 1:25:52.200]  you have the military arrest them and you have tribunals
[1:25:52.200 --> 1:25:54.200]  that's what you do
[1:25:54.200 --> 1:25:56.200]  you're right
[1:25:56.200 --> 1:25:58.200]  that's the game they brought
[1:25:58.200 --> 1:26:00.200]  that this is the arena
[1:26:00.200 --> 1:26:02.200]  they're now in
[1:26:02.200 --> 1:26:04.200]  part of the reason why I say that
[1:26:04.200 --> 1:26:06.200]  is because a lot of
[1:26:06.200 --> 1:26:08.200]  people have suffered
[1:26:08.200 --> 1:26:10.200]  I've been suffering ever since Obama
[1:26:10.200 --> 1:26:12.200]  I didn't vote for the cat
[1:26:12.200 --> 1:26:14.200]  because I've seen him coming off the gate
[1:26:14.200 --> 1:26:16.200]  from people like you and a couple other people I used to listen to
[1:26:16.200 --> 1:26:18.200]  and just from doing my basic research
[1:26:18.200 --> 1:26:20.200]  I knew he wasn't no good
[1:26:20.200 --> 1:26:22.200]  and I'm a black African American
[1:26:22.200 --> 1:26:24.200]  okay
[1:26:24.200 --> 1:26:26.200]  I'm a former person
[1:26:26.200 --> 1:26:28.200]  I used to be an elder
[1:26:28.200 --> 1:26:30.200]  I walked away from that
[1:26:30.200 --> 1:26:32.200]  because I've seen the bias
[1:26:32.200 --> 1:26:34.200]  that I was surrounded by
[1:26:34.200 --> 1:26:36.200]  this man was not a Christian
[1:26:36.200 --> 1:26:38.200]  when he was at Saddleback church
[1:26:38.200 --> 1:26:40.200]  here in California
[1:26:40.200 --> 1:26:42.200]  he talked bad about the father of faith
[1:26:42.200 --> 1:26:44.200]  of Abraham
[1:26:44.200 --> 1:26:46.200]  that means you're not a Christian
[1:26:46.200 --> 1:26:48.200]  you don't want nothing to do with it
[1:26:48.200 --> 1:26:50.200]  but I digress
[1:26:50.200 --> 1:26:52.200]  what I'm feeling to understand is
[1:26:52.200 --> 1:26:54.200]  we are here at that point
[1:26:54.200 --> 1:26:56.200]  and what Trumps need to stop
[1:26:56.200 --> 1:26:58.200]  doing is running a presidency
[1:26:58.200 --> 1:27:00.200]  like he's sitting in this office
[1:27:00.200 --> 1:27:02.200]  running one of his companies
[1:27:02.200 --> 1:27:04.200]  this is a reality buddy
[1:27:04.200 --> 1:27:06.200]  and I know he's in a hell of a position
[1:27:06.200 --> 1:27:08.200]  and I take my hats off to him
[1:27:08.200 --> 1:27:10.200]  he's got some balls sitting on a skateboard
[1:27:10.200 --> 1:27:12.200]  you know just to get up there and do what he's doing
[1:27:12.200 --> 1:27:14.200]  no you're right but now he's in that game
[1:27:14.200 --> 1:27:16.200]  and you're right
[1:27:16.200 --> 1:27:18.200]  we've exposed him we've made them show their fangs
[1:27:18.200 --> 1:27:20.200]  they openly want to destroy the country
[1:27:20.200 --> 1:27:22.200]  and the Democrats
[1:27:22.200 --> 1:27:24.200]  are involved in election fraud everywhere
[1:27:24.200 --> 1:27:26.200]  trying to get illegal aliens registered to vote
[1:27:26.200 --> 1:27:28.200]  and so you're right a regular political response
[1:27:28.200 --> 1:27:30.200]  is not the response to this
[1:27:30.200 --> 1:27:32.200]  I mean I hate to go back to Hitler
[1:27:32.200 --> 1:27:34.200]  it's like Hitler attacks you
[1:27:34.200 --> 1:27:36.200]  you don't have political responses to that
[1:27:36.200 --> 1:27:38.200]  you have military responses and we've seen
[1:27:38.200 --> 1:27:40.200]  the globalist operation
[1:27:40.200 --> 1:27:42.200]  is military it's not political
[1:27:42.200 --> 1:27:44.200]  well you can't
[1:27:44.200 --> 1:27:46.200]  you gotta fight fire with fire here
[1:27:46.200 --> 1:27:48.200]  you know what I mean you can't use no fire
[1:27:48.200 --> 1:27:50.200]  extinguisher over here we gotta diesel fire
[1:27:50.200 --> 1:27:52.200]  there's special stuff we gotta use over here
[1:27:52.200 --> 1:27:54.200]  and we had that
[1:27:54.200 --> 1:27:56.200]  they need to let the Marines loose
[1:27:56.200 --> 1:27:58.200]  Obama and Hillary pissed the Marines off
[1:27:58.200 --> 1:28:00.200]  you know what I mean
[1:28:00.200 --> 1:28:02.200]  let them loose
[1:28:02.200 --> 1:28:04.200]  you know it's time for some redemption around here
[1:28:04.200 --> 1:28:06.200]  you know we're sitting here
[1:28:06.200 --> 1:28:08.200]  am I a Trump supporter
[1:28:08.200 --> 1:28:10.200]  being black I say it again
[1:28:10.200 --> 1:28:12.200]  I'm suffering over here financially
[1:28:12.200 --> 1:28:14.200]  you know what I mean
[1:28:14.200 --> 1:28:16.200]  and they're literally trying to bring the country down
[1:28:16.200 --> 1:28:18.200]  and bankrupt it and telling us that
[1:28:18.200 --> 1:28:20.200]  and trying to make us all kill each other
[1:28:20.200 --> 1:28:22.200]  you're absolutely right
[1:28:22.200 --> 1:28:24.200]  I mean instead of the Marines
[1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:26.200]  if Trump's gonna do it he needs covert action
[1:28:26.200 --> 1:28:28.200]  all he's gotta do is the top leadership of the globalist
[1:28:28.200 --> 1:28:30.200]  maybe 20 people
[1:28:30.200 --> 1:28:32.200]  they all die in kayak accidents this week
[1:28:32.200 --> 1:28:34.200]  and they'll stop right to cut the head off
[1:28:34.200 --> 1:28:36.200]  and I'm not gonna do that myself
[1:28:36.200 --> 1:28:38.200]  but I would support covert action
[1:28:38.200 --> 1:28:40.200]  I would support the president
[1:28:40.200 --> 1:28:42.200]  anybody that's taking Chai Kong money
[1:28:42.200 --> 1:28:44.200]  I would push in Dan the teams and kill them
[1:28:44.200 --> 1:28:46.200]  but can you trust the people
[1:28:46.200 --> 1:28:48.200]  the deluxe you do that
[1:28:48.200 --> 1:28:50.200]  there's people that can be trusted to carry it out
[1:28:50.200 --> 1:29:12.200]  Hi I'm Dan Pilla I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house
[1:29:12.200 --> 1:29:20.200]  If you owe taxes you can't pay don't wait another day there's no such thing as a hopeless tax case call 834 no tax
[1:29:20.200 --> 1:29:22.200]  or go to my website danpilla.com
[1:29:22.200 --> 1:29:44.200]  Danpilla.com
[1:29:44.200 --> 1:29:56.200]  Or to order call 866-295-5305
[1:29:56.200 --> 1:29:59.200]  The demand for food has not let up
[1:29:59.200 --> 1:30:02.200]  we are selling record amounts of it
[1:30:02.200 --> 1:30:04.200]  everybody else has basically already sold out
[1:30:04.200 --> 1:30:06.200]  or they have giant wait list
[1:30:06.200 --> 1:30:08.200]  our suppliers have it in-house
[1:30:08.200 --> 1:30:10.200]  mistaken 7 to 10 days to deliver
[1:30:10.200 --> 1:30:12.200]  because again they have to package it
[1:30:12.200 --> 1:30:14.200]  they are running 24 hours a day
[1:30:14.200 --> 1:30:16.200]  but in a few days
[1:30:16.200 --> 1:30:18.200]  they are telling me it may go to a longer wait
[1:30:18.200 --> 1:30:20.200]  if you haven't gotten your order in

[1:32:54.200 --> 1:32:56.200]  today
[1:32:56.200 --> 1:33:02.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:33:13.040 --> 1:33:18.040]  On a warm summer's eve on a train bound for no way
[1:33:18.620 --> 1:33:23.000]  I met up with the camera. We were both too tired to sleep
[1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:29.000]  So we took turns a-staring out the window at the darkness
[1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:34.000]  The boredom overtook us and he began to speak
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  He said, son, I've made a life out of reading people's faces
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  Knowing what the cards were by the way they held their eyes
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  So if you don't mind my saying I can see you're out of aces
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  For a taste of your whiskey, I'll give you some advice
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  Then he bombed a cigarette and asked me for a light
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  And the night got definitely quiet
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  Then his face lost all expression
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  Said, if you're gonna play the game, boy, you gotta learn to play it right
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  Cause you got to know when to hold it
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  Know when to fold up
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  Know when to walk away
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  Know when to walk away
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  Know when to run
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  You never count on me
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  We are back taking your phone calls right now
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  When you're sitting at the table
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  There'll be time enough
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  It's very positive to see Trump taking action
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  When the deal is done
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  And they have totally paralyzed the president
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  The idea that he can't pardon Roger Stone
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  The idea that he can't say
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  You don't want to fight corruption in Ukraine
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  That's the federal law
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  If he's giving money to that country
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  Taxpayer money has to do that
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  He just needs to stop caring
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  What these lawyers and scumbags tell him
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  And as long as he knows he's doing the right thing
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  As long as we don't politically disagree with him
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  He has our backing
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  That's how it works
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  But as sure as the sun came up this morning
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:15.000]  They're going to steal that election in 264 days
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  You've already seen them pull out every stop they've got
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  You've already seen them stealing stuff from
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  Sanders
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  Who I can't stand, but he's popular with Democrats
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  So he doesn't have a choice
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  They're going to destroy him
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  Just like the sun came up this morning, as I said
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  If he doesn't take action
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  And I'm not somebody that wants to hear about direct action
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  And covert kill teams and the rest of this
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  But the globalists are shipping MS-13 in
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  They're giving illegal aliens voter registration cards
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  And driver's license there
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  Openly trying to foment race war
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  For no reason when Trump's trying to create unity
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  Letting that happen is allowing violence to take place
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  So I'm not a coward
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  And we entered the wheelhouse of violence a long time ago
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  But we're winning with ideas and political moves
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  So I'd just say like Gandhi would say
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  Or Martin Luther King Jr. take it on the chin
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  If we were losing
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  I'd say, okay, we got a 1776
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  We got to get the guns
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  But we're winning
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  So if I got to take it on the chin
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  Or if we got to go through a lot of pain
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  To not give them what they want
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  They're desperately trying to get violence right now
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  Because they're losing their ash
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  That said, I don't just say this stuff
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  People have noticed like stuff I said 20 years ago
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  Is now all over the news
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  It's not that China is all powerful
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  China 70 years ago at the end of World War II
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  Was 97% rural
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  Maybe 2% of them had electricity
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  Maybe 10% had running water
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  And now they've got more industry than we do
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  That was because globalists made deals
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  To build them up artificially
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  Because globalists own China
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  So that was their own investment going straight up
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  That said, anybody that is in bed with the Chai comms
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  Once they got more arrogant in the last 20 years or so
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  They make you put one of their officers in your company
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  And so anybody that's got a Chinese intelligence agency
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  Operative in their deal
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  We don't need to sit there and let that damage the economy
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  Let's just talk about what you actually do
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  We kill the Chinese agents
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  Not me, I'm talking about Trump
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  Needs to have the military go kill them
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  That's what you're supposed to do, okay?
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  Just kill them
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  This is not acting tough
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  It's not, oh, I'm a big man guy
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  That's the default
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  You got a foreign intelligence operative inside the Senate
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  Inside the house, inside the U.S. corporation
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  Kill them
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  My God, it's not a big deal
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  Go grab them out of their house at night
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  And slit their damn throat
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  What you're supposed to do
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  Stop playing games here
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  Kill the Chinese agents now
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  Let's start there
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  And all these Democrats will roll over like that
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  As soon as their handler is dead
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  Kill the foreign agents now, Trump
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  And I know you've got the people ready to do it
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  And don't be scared that, oh, they'll leak it to the media
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  Everyone's gonna back you
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  Kill them, kill them now
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  That's very simple
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  Do it
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  You know, they've been killing our people over there for no reason
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  And killing Christian adoption groups and things
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  No more
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  Kill them, kill them now
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  Let's just start there
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  Let's just start there
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  And you watch the Democrats in the deep state
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  Yellow bellies, as soon as their controllers are all dead
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  Let's stop playing games just...
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  It's so easy
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  It's so easy, it's like pumpkin pie, man
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  So eat a piece of pumpkin pie with whipped cream on top
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  This is not hard to do
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  And it needs to be done
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  And America needs to stop rolling over to this BS
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  But it feels good saying that, doesn't it?
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  Because that's what we're supposed to do
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  Let's not talk about tribunals, the Marines, and some big battle
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  With the deep state up front
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  Let's have a battle they never knew hit them
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  Because believe me
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  You turn loose to U.S. military
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  On known Chinese agents inside the United States
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  It's legal, it's lawful
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  They're involved in espionage in our country
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  We're not gonna have trials or big long events
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  Or a bunch of crying about it or wringing our hands
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  You do what the Chai comms do
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  If they catch U.S. agents over there, they kill them
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  So it's tit for tat
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  Oh, really?
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  So you've caught operatives that aren't under your control
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  And Obama gave them the whole office of personal management hack
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  To know who's who and who they can roll over
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  And who they can...
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  They've infiltrated us
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  They've overrun us
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  And so push the lawyers out of this discussion
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  Because the lawyers will lose this country for us real fast
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  Lawyers didn't start this country
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  Lawyers didn't win World War II
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  They didn't win the war of 1812
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  They won't do anything but lose the country
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  Now is the time to kill
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  And to have the killer instinct and to stop worrying about it
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  Chai comms came here
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  They expect to overrun us and defeat us
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  Instead, they die
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  Now I'm gonna stop talking about that and go to your phone calls
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  Joseph in Ireland, thanks for holding
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  Joseph, you're on the air worldwide
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  Go ahead
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  Hi, Alex, how are you?
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  I'm all right, brother
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  What do you make of what's happening?
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  Well, first of all, my gut feeling was
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  This coronavirus is man-made
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  And I think you've proven it
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  But I believe there's much worse to come
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  Whether it was accidentally released
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  Or deliberately...
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  It doesn't matter, it's part of their plan
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  They're plowing on
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  And I also believe the locusts in East Africa are a man weapon
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  And I believe the locusts to come will be much worse
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  They will actually attack people
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  Like a meevil intent
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  Because this is...
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  They're wiping out the population
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  Preparing us for World War III
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  But they don't want a big population around when
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  The Third World War happens
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  Or much reduced
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  And it doesn't matter, they've got a plan
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  They're plowing on
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  Trump is in the way
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  But, you know, they'll keep attacking him
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  And hopefully one punch will bring him down
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  What do you make of him?
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  What should he do to the Chinese dragon right now?
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  I mean, I say stomp his guts out
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  Well, I believe you see
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  The problem is he's got so many inside that is leaking out
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  And he can't do anything covert
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  So launch on the Democrats legally
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  Like I was just thinking there while you were talking
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  All the families of the victims of the sanctuary cities
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  Launch a huge law cases against the Democrats
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  For the murder of their relatives
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  Backed by the state
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  I don't know whether they...
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  Something like that
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  Some big case
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  Launch huge investigations into their election fraud
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  No, I agree
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  Whatever he does, he's got to go on the offense
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  Thank you, Joseph
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  Jacob, John, Maverick, Mitch, Tyler, Justin, Sam, James
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  Your calls
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  I'm going to shut up when we come back
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  And we're going to take calls
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  Do you think the Chai comms would let their operatives
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  Be controlled by the United States?
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  They'd never put up with it
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:43:09.000]  We know that that is the case
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  And we know the federal government
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:13.000]  And major corporations have been buying up
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  All the major storable food supplies
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:16.000]  Around the country
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:18.000]  Almost everyone else is sold out
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:20.000]  That's why you have to wait 10 to 14 days
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  For it to get delivered
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:22.000]  Not because they don't have the food
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  But because they've got to package it
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  And their factories are going 24 hours a day
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  High-quality fresh food
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:29.000]  The best package systems
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  Taste great
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:31.000]  Protects you and your family
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  And funds the Info War
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  You just got to get the orders in
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:36.000]  Until they extend it out even more
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  Which could happen
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:38.000]  Lock in your orders now
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  Ensure you get it
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  At infowarstore.com today
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  If you are receiving this transmission
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:55.000]  You are the resistance
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:43:57.000]  Well, it's finally happening
[1:43:57.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  The president is coming out
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:43:59.000]  And saying the deep state
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:01.000]  Are a bunch of out-of-control criminals
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  That need to be prosecuted
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  And he has fired over 200 senior bureaucrats
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  In the state department
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  And the justice department
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:13.000]  In just the last few days
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  And he took the head prosecutor
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:17.000]  Over stone and offered her a job
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  At treasury
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  As soon as she quit that job
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  He then withdrew the nomination
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  And now she's out on her globalist ass
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:26.000]  This is beautiful
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  It's happening
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  But we need to see a lot more
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:30.000]  All the neocons need to be fired
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  All the Obama appointees
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  Fired
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  All the deep state globalists
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:37.000]  Who have resumes with George Soros
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  Fired
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:39.000]  Fired
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  Fired
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  Trump is finally unleashed
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:44.000]  Trump is not the red wave
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  He is the red storm
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  And info wars is the tip of the spear
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  Powered by we the people
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  Never backing down
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  Never giving in
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  And delivering victory in our time
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  There's roughly only 260 days left
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:01.000]  Until the 2020 election
[1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  And already you've seen
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  All sorts of crazy things happen
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  The globalists are trying
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:05.000]  To plunge the economy
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  They're trying to start wars
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  They're trying to overthrow the president
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  They're trying to silence free speech
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  They're trying to trigger riots in the streets
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  But everything they do
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  Is blowing up in their face
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  We the people have to pray
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  Stay focused
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  Be involved
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  Keep spreading the word
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  Keep countering their lies
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  And we have to be prepared
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  In case things go south
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  That's why it's so critical

[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  To make all your dreams come true
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  When this was coming
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  I talked about this intensely in the first hour
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  How big tech
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  Can control what words you can use
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  And plans to
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  Siri is now not letting
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  You say the word gun
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  To Info Wars dot com
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  Article
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  And you know it's some
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  Substrate a test of only so many users
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  Apple Siri voice assistant
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  Is now apparently refusing to say the word gun
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  When using an iPad
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  Tracy Connors we had a video of her
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  Self attempting to have Siri
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  Read out a daily caller headline
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  Entitled Virginia House of Delegates
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  Passes gun ban
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  Caesar Bill would not do it
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  I tried it during the break
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  Would not do it as well
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  How could you attack
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:50.000]  Words in language unless you have AI
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  In place
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  This isn't just about election meddling
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  It's about total AI control
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  And Trump needs to take action
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  All right let's go to your calls
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  Jacob we're going to go in the order
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  They've been received
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  Jacob in Ohio thanks for holding her on the air
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  Welcome
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  Alex did you know that if you go to freeshaffer.com
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  You can see that a man in tear hot
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  Total prison was beheaded by jihadis
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  Byron above supermax
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  My friend Schaefer Cox is in the same wing
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  I'm concerned for his safety
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  He says people there have scurvy
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  If they don't give them vitamin C in this
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  Pandemic that's murder
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  Well I'm not aware of all that
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  But all the Islamists have taken over the prisons
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  What else is on your mind sir
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  Well
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  Schaefer Cox is going to
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  Go for a retrial in my estimation
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  If he can get it in the 9th circuit
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:42.000]  So I'm looking forward to that
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  Schaefer Cox
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  He needs to pardon just as much as Roger Stone does
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  Okay I'll look into it
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  You called it about the surgeon general
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  CDC and coronavirus
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  Absolutely we'll get to that
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  The surgeon general has power over
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  Supervision over the bureau of prison
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  And
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  It's one thing
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  If you call in on that top
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  I've got to go on to you brother
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  When you call in on one thing and you said it was another
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  I'm not doing it
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  You talked to John in Virginia
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  John thanks for calling
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  Yeah they just passed in the house
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  Their gun confiscation sounds fun
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:20.000]  Yeah it sounds like a good time
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  Hey Alex thanks for taking my call
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  It's a privilege to talk to you
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  I'm a first time caller and I hope
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  I hope you can get to my three questions
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  And maybe comments
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  My first question for you is
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  What can Trump do about what the Virginia
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  Governor and legislature
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  Are legislation are doing
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  Anything
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  Well that'd be for the courts
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  The Supreme Court in DC versus Heller
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  Says that the legislation they're trying to pass
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  Is unconstitutional
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  That's what I would think too
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  I guess my second question then
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  Can he do something about it himself
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  I guess that's part of my first
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  Well I mean
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  Governor Northam is a compromised
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  Blackmailed individual with all his weird past
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  He's a doctor that's involved in
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  Literally baby part harvesting right there
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  The problem is Democrats as you know
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  Once they get control they have election fraud
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  And that's why they've just got to be removed
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:14.000]  They've got to be racketeer
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  Investigations have to happen
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  And they've got to just be exposed as the criminal group
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  They are and I think that's the answer
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  Is Virginians getting pissed
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  And Virginians exposing the election system
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  And showing that this is all a takeover
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  I think that's the answer
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  I hope that happens
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  The other thing I wanted to ask you about
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  Is
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  Do the courts get into this fight
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  Do you think we'll go to the Supreme Court
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:40.000]  Assuming we don't get anything radical
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  Like what I'd like to see happen
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  What you just said
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  Oh I think it'll be overturned
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  At the Supreme Court and they try to ban guns in Virginia
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  Again and you're like well
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  It's unpopular so that'll wake folks up
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  Democrats literally take over jurisdictions
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  And engage in election fraud
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  That's why they're invincible is because they're a fraud
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  But you expose the election machines
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  And how Democrats never get removed
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  From office
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  And how Democrats are actually a dead party
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  That is how you bring them down
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  That's how you expose them
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  And you get their own people that are involved in the election fraud
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  To turn states evidence
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  And get a bunch of people to start turning against
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  The deep state
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  And the whole house of cards will come down
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  We're very very close to that
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  On that line I actually worked in election
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  During Obama's second election
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:28.000]  And I watched election fraud
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:30.000]  Here in my hometown
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  Not fraud, what I watched was
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  Illegal actions which neither
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  The Democrat nor the Republican
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  Committeeman at the polling
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  Place nor the man in charge
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  When I informed them about
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  Of course it's systemic
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  I don't just say Democrats
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  Don't get elected anywhere
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:50.000]  They don't, everyone hates them
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  They wreck everything
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  But they have election fraud
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  They're a bold criminal racketeering mafia
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  That just tried to overthrow a president
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  That just tried to create a race war
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  And they're done
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  I mean the only way to address them
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:06.000]  Is as a criminal mafia
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  God bless you, thanks for the call John
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  Alright, let's go to Mack in Wisconsin
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  Mack here on the air
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  Where the Democrats are going to have their DNC event
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  They say if Bernie doesn't get the nomination
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  They're going to burn the country down
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  Well we'll be there covering it live
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  And as much as I dislike Bernie
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  He is the frontrunner, they're trying to seal it from him
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  What do you think about Trump taking action?
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  Alex, boy, first of all
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:30.000]  Maybe I'll see you there Alex
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:32.000]  And if I do my friend
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  I'm going to give you the strongest
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  Handshake of a man to a man
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  That you will have ever felt because
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  I'm so glad you're on my side
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:42.000]  I'm on your side brother
[1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  These guys shake my hand all the time and crush my hand
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  I'm not that strong
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  T-Rex that little
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:50.000]  Anyways
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  So anyways
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:54.000]  I want to call in about the censorship
[1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  Problem and of course we're losing our free speech
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  Seems like daily
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  But
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  You know
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  With these platforms
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  Google, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  Personally myself
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  I don't care about them but do you know
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  I'm probably one of your
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  Honest longest time listeners
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  I've been listening to you for 20
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:18.000]  Maybe even 22 years
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  Wow brother, God bless you
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  This is no kidding
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  Out of all things
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  A short wave radio
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  And I've been listening to you ever since
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  That was back in the William Cooper days
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  No kidding my friend
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  And you know
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  This is something to keep in mind for your listeners
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  You know if it was
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  Ever to happen
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  If they ever were able to hit that internet kill switch
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  You know what
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  We do have backup
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  And a slow tech backup
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  Brother, we still pay $10,000
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  To have a WCR to be on 6 hours
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  A day
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  World service, we get a lot of letters
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  I get letters from Africa
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  And places people listening so
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  We still pay for that, it's part of the whole outreach we do
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  Great Alex, yep everybody should have one
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  In the preparedness
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  It's cool at your kitchen table
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  At night or in the day
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  Just get on there and dial through
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  And it's like wow, it's not watching you
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  Everything with the internet is two way
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  It's watching what you're watching
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  Shortwave or
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  Broadcast TV any of it
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  You're actually watching TV, it doesn't watch you
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  Remember back when TV didn't watch everybody
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  Yeah, you nailed it
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  You just nailed it right there
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  That's very true
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  I could listen to that shortwave
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  I could dial in frequencies all over the world
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  I was a former radio man in the Navy
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  Back in Vietnam days
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  On a ship and
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  Think about the Sigra Police
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  In Nazi Germany if you listen to Allied Broadcast
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  Well, but they couldn't tell because you're listening
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  It's a receiver
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  But now with the internet they know what you're watching
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  They have a whole record
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  So the thing is really got problems
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  Alex, if I may one more thing
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  I'd like to bring up the virus
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  Over there in China
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  I don't know if this has been discussed and I'll try to make it quick
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  My friend
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  Just over there what's happening with this virus
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  Do you think they are
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  Using that as a
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  False flag in the manner of
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  Now they're rounding up the protesters
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  That were protesting over there
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  And saying, oh these people are loaded with the virus
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  But we're going to make it look like
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  We're taking them out of their homes
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  Because of the virus
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  Are they arresting these people and never to be seen again
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  What do you think?
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  I mean it's confirmed what you said
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  They were losing the fight with the Hong Kong
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  And Taiwan, these protesters
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  The Chinese government lost its fight
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  With Trump on the
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  Economic war
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  The giant face saving measure
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  And we know they're using it
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  As a pretext around the political distance
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  So you're absolutely right
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  That's why Trump's got his reasons
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  He hasn't worked the economy
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  But praising Xi Jinping's response
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  Agreeing with the UN
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  You know, Xi Jinping is absolutely using this
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  As a giant power grab
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  And next hour we've got Francis Boyle
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  Popping in to talk about
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  How he called Friday for Trump to come out
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  And say it may be a bio weapon
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  Now the Chinese ambassadors responded
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  So that's all coming up. Matt, thank you so much
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  Okay, we're going to go to break
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  And then we're going to talk to
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  Mitch and
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:22.000]  Tyler and everybody else

[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  And Nick

[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  Toothpaste and the super blue toothpaste
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  With nano silver about to sell out
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:48.000]  This should really be
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:50.000]  Easier than it is
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:54.000]  I'm pointing out the way forward
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:56.000]  Things that I've discovered
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  That I absolutely know work

[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:12.000]  And it's symbiotic
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:14.000]  My friends, I harp and harp
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  And harp about iodine because it's the good halogen
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  Fluorides the bad halogen
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:20.000]  And people told me about it for years
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  And I didn't listen and I'm so thankful
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  That finally I listened to Dr. Group
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:26.000]  Like eight years ago
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  I started taking true iodine
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  Atomic iodine
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:32.000]  We've got it back in stock X2

[1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:14.000]  It's incredible
[1:59:14.000 --> 1:59:16.000]  But there's major obstacles coming down the road
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:19.000]  And the only way we can effectively fight the NWO

[1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:29.000]  But I am blowing through our backup money
[1:59:29.000 --> 1:59:32.000]  Right now with our reporters doing triple the work
[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:34.000]  They ever have because they volunteered to do it
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  And Owen and the rest of the crew will fight
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:38.000]  18 hours a day, 7 days a week
[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:40.000]  During this election year that's so critical
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:43.000]  But they need the financing to put them in the field
[1:59:43.000 --> 1:59:45.000]  Go to infowarstore.com
[1:59:45.000 --> 1:59:47.000]  And fight for your own future
[1:59:47.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:17.000]  It's a great night
[2:00:17.000 --> 2:00:19.000]  What I do know that I love you
[2:00:19.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  And I know that if you love me too
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:25.000]  What a wonderful petafile world it will be
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  Well, no much about geography
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:33.000]  No more much trigonometry
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:35.000]  Alright let's go to your phone calls here
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:38.000]  And then Dr. Boyle pops up for two segments
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:41.000]  Then the calls continue into the fourth hour
[2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  Let's go to Mitch in Canada
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  And then we'll go to Austin, Tyler and Sam
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  Mitch, you're on the air, thanks for holding
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  Alex, you're worth the wait my friend
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:53.000]  Well thank you for being here
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  I just wanted to see if you've referenced CCN
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  Three reasons why stock market
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  Excuse me, my computer's just frozen
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:05.000]  I understand
[2:01:05.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  Reference CCN stock market
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  Three reasons why the stock market
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  Is headed for devastating crash
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  Now if you go down the page
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  You'll see, they have a video
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  That if you skip to 509
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  You can blatantly see the central banks
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  Pumping in money to all the stock markets
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:29.000]  Across the world
[2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:31.000]  Oh there's a global rise of devaluation
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  There's no doubt about that
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:33.000]  Like how obvious is this?
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:35.000]  Like how do people not see this?
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  So anyway, I think we're headed for global recession
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:39.000]  There's no doubt about that
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  Yeah, then Trump wants us to be in the best position
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:43.000]  When the crash comes
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  There's no doubt that Trump's preparing a crash landing
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:47.000]  And if he does it
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  He wants to stall it until he gets reelected
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:53.000]  But it's still, I mean, it's going to be a circus
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:55.000]  It's going to be a fight uphill if he gets reelected
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:57.000]  And he's going to deal with this, no doubt
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  If you go to Healthline, how flu and HIV meds
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  May help fight the new coronavirus
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  But come on, like, how is the HIV medication
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:09.000]  Supposed to help this bat virus
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:11.000]  Or whatever you want to call it
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  This is man-made, man
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:13.000]  Like this is man-made
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  Well, I mean, it has the HIV delivery system
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:17.000]  Exactly
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  And they're like, oh, don't worry
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  HIV medicine helps, like
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  Yeah, we can profit off of this
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  But you know what, at the end of the day
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  I'm just disgusted with the fact that
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:27.000]  You know, some people have decided
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  That they would go forward with biological warfare programs
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  You put the entire human race at risk
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:35.000]  And shame on you, like, it's just disgusting
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:37.000]  And then we're not supposed to question it
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:39.000]  Like, they praise Chinese activist questioning
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  But when we do it, or you do it, you get banned
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  Oh, we're not supposed to do that in the West
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:47.000]  Question things, just, you know, believe Jesse Smallit
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:49.000]  It's just mind-boggling
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:51.000]  But anyway, I just want to say thank you very much
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:53.000]  For what you do, and really appreciate it
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:55.000]  I hope that the people look into these things
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  A little bit further
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:57.000]  Brother, I appreciate you
[2:02:57.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  You're talking about the tail wagging the dog, man
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:01.000]  You're the dog, brother
[2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:02.000]  We love you
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  Tyler, in California, real fast
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  Go ahead, Tyler
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  Hey, Alex, just a couple things I want to make my point
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:10.000]  How the empire strikes back
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  It's about the electoral college
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  And I've been seeing it
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  Oh, yeah, they want to get rid of that, don't they?
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  Yeah, well, you can see it
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  There's been pieces the last week or so
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  Now they're on the West Coast
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:23.000]  And they're demonizing the electoral college
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  You know, it was bad
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  Trump never accepted the results of the election
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  Hillary won the vote, which we know she didn't
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  But they've already taken out
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:33.000]  Well, they're trying to
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  Social media and the grassroots
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:37.000]  I call them the generals, stone and a saunge
[2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:39.000]  Those are the big things that got Trump in
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  Now you're right, they're...
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  And they're setting the precedent
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  To dispute the next election
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  Yep, and the coronavirus
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  They can use that
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  When people start dying
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  You know, it's really easy to say
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  Trump's incompetent, look what happened
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:56.000]  He broke out
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  You know, he didn't do anything about it
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  When people start dying, people panic
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  They do a rational thing
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  So that's just one more thing that they can use
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  And it's all coming up for the election, man
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:07.000]  That's what it's coming down to
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  And I really think
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  You should look into that
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:12.000]  The electoral college is going to be their next move
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  They're going to try to demonize it
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  And basically get rid of it
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:19.000]  No, you're absolutely right
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  We'll cover all that, thank you so much, Tyler
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  When we come back, we've got
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  A gentleman on who was here with us Friday
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  Saying we need a
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  Investigation of this
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  Being a bio weapon
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  And then hours later, you saw the White House spokesperson
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  Come out and say, indeed, Chinese
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  Investigate this
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  As a potential bio weapon
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  You've seen Senator Cotton say further things
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  Dr. Francis Boyle, straight ahead
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  For two segments, and then your calls
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  On the other side, infowars.com
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  Tomorrow's news day
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:22.000]  The nomination
[2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:24.000]  And now she's out on her globalist ass
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:26.000]  This is beautiful
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:28.000]  It's happening, but we need to see a lot more
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:30.000]  All the neocons need to be fired
[2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:32.000]  All the Obama appointees, fired
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:34.000]  All the deep state globalists
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:36.000]  Who have resumes with George Soros
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  Fired, fired, fired, fired
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:40.000]  Trump is finally unleashed
[2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:42.000]  Trump is not the red wave
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:44.000]  He is the red storm
[2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  And infowars is the tip of the spear
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:48.000]  Powered by we the people
[2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:50.000]  Never backing down
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:52.000]  Never giving in and delivering
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  Victory in our time
[2:06:08.000 --> 2:06:10.000]  Alright, he joined us last week
[2:06:10.000 --> 2:06:12.000]  And
[2:06:12.000 --> 2:06:14.000]  Said he's being investigated as a bio weapon
[2:06:14.000 --> 2:06:16.000]  And we've had
[2:06:16.000 --> 2:06:18.000]  One of Trump's spokespersons come out
[2:06:18.000 --> 2:06:20.000]  And say the same things to a few hours later
[2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:22.000]  So I wanted to get an update
[2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  From Dr. Francis Boyle
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:26.000]  Who wrote the U.S. Biological Weapons
[2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:28.000]  Convention
[2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:30.000]  That then got adopted, most of it by the United Nations
[2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  I'm not going to go over his whole bio
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  He's an author, researcher
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  And again
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:38.000]  A top bio weapons expert
[2:06:38.000 --> 2:06:40.000]  Not just in the technicals, but also in the law
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:42.000]  So let's get right to him
[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  In the two segments we have
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:46.000]  The developments we've had in the last
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  Five, six days
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:50.000]  Since he was last on
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:06:52.000]  Thanks for joining us, Dr.
[2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  Thank you very much
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  For having me on, Alex
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:06:58.000]  My best reviewing audience
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  And I just wanted to commend you personally
[2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:02.000]  For
[2:07:02.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  Staying on top of this
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  I think you're doing a real public
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  Service for the American people
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:10.000]  And the United States
[2:07:10.000 --> 2:07:12.000]  Of America
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:14.000]  The situation
[2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:16.000]  Apparently has
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:18.000]  Got worse
[2:07:18.000 --> 2:07:20.000]  A British health care specialist
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  Has estimated
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  That the incubation period
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:26.000]  Is now 24 days
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  Instead of
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  14 days
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  You really can't believe anything
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:34.000]  Coming out of
[2:07:34.000 --> 2:07:36.000]  China on this, you can watch
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:38.000]  On the BBC
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  And other sources
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:42.000]  Are being there
[2:07:42.000 --> 2:07:44.000]  This
[2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:46.000]  Disinformation that a pan-globin
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:48.000]  Was somehow involved
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:50.000]  Is total bull-twaddle
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:52.000]  Coming out of China
[2:07:52.000 --> 2:07:54.000]  Now, pan-globins
[2:07:54.000 --> 2:07:56.000]  Have been around since the
[2:07:56.000 --> 2:07:58.000]  Pliocene age with the
[2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:00.000]  Dinosaurs
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  And what, all of a sudden, out of nowhere
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:04.000]  In 2020, they become
[2:08:04.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  More lethal than the
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  Spanish flu virus
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:10.000]  The
[2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  Lethality rate has now
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:14.000]  Been estimated
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  Somewhere between
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  15 percent to
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:20.000]  18 percent
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  17 percent, even if you
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:24.000]  Believe the figures
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:26.000]  Coming out of China, 18 percent
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:28.000]  I believe by
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  A British health care worker
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:32.000]  There is now the report
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  In Hong Kong
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  Just came out today
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:38.000]  That it had
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:40.000]  This coronavirus has
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:42.000]  Been spread
[2:08:42.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  By a leaky
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:46.000]  Sewage pipe
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:48.000]  Which, to me, indicates
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:50.000]  That it can be transmitted
[2:08:50.000 --> 2:08:52.000]  By human feces
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:54.000]  And or
[2:08:54.000 --> 2:08:56.000]  Euron
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:08:58.000]  Recall, I had told you before
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  This has
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  Gain of function
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:04.000]  Properties, which means
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  It can be
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  It does travel by air
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:10.000]  So that wouldn't surprise me
[2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:12.000]  That someone's poop is
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  Going down
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  Downstairs
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:18.000]  To the sewer and there's a leaky
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  Sewage drain
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  There and
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:24.000]  Just off gases of virus
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  It off gases of virus
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:28.000]  It is the virus
[2:09:28.000 --> 2:09:30.000]  I think it's
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:32.000]  As I said, gain of function
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:34.000]  So this is
[2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  A fine gain of function for those
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  Who don't know what that means
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  It has been enhanced
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:42.000]  By DNA genetic engineering
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:44.000]  And or synthetic biology
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  To make it
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  Supercharged
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:50.000]  It is turbocharged, that's correct
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:52.000]  If you saw that movie
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:54.000]  Ford versus Ferrari
[2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:56.000]  That's exactly what we're doing
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:09:58.000]  It's here, souped up
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:00.000]  Shelby
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:02.000]  Clearly
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:04.000]  Governments are freaking out
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  But they're trying to act like it's no big deal
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:08.000]  Is that because they know how big
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:10.000]  A threat it is and will they be successful
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  Covering it up?
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  Well, you'll see
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  The United States Army
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:18.000]  Has already designated
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:20.000]  Several military bases
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  Around the country
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  To detain people who are
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:26.000]  Infected. So I think
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:28.000]  The United States government knows
[2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  How serious it is
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  I still don't believe
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:34.000]  That President
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  Trump has been properly
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  Advised here
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  As I said, I'm not blaming
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:42.000]  President Trump
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:44.000]  He's not an expert in this field
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  He has to rely on his advisors
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:48.000]  Tony Fauci
[2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:50.000]  Has been up to his eyeballs
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:52.000]  In this Nazi
[2:10:52.000 --> 2:10:54.000]  Bio warfare work for years
[2:10:54.000 --> 2:10:56.000]  The same is true for
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  The Center for Disease Control
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:00.000]  Azar
[2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:02.000]  The HHS
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:04.000]  Secretary
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:06.000]  This is the case of the fox being in charge
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:08.000]  Of the chicken coop
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:10.000]  Well, Dr. Boyle, believe me, I like Trump overall
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:12.000]  But I don't hold punches
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  And he respects the show and he respects
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:16.000]  I know the work we do here in you
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:18.000]  So address the president, good chance
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:20.000]  He or his adjuncts will end up giving him the message
[2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  Because he wants these messages brought to him
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:24.000]  So what do you want to say to President Trump?
[2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:26.000]  Again, Azar
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:28.000]  This is the case of the fox
[2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:30.000]  Being in charge of the chicken coop
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:32.000]  He was an employee
[2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  In a lobbyist for the drug industry
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:36.000]  And the drug industry is
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  All up and down involved
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:40.000]  In Nazi Bio
[2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  Warfare work
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:44.000]  Asking, you are correct
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:46.000]  That the president has asked
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:48.000]  For an opinion from
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:50.000]  The National Academy of Sciences
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  But as you note from
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  All the emails I sent you
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:56.000]  The National Academy of Sciences
[2:11:56.000 --> 2:11:58.000]  Likewise is up to its eyeballs
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:00.000]  In Nazi
[2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  Bio warfare
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  Work including synthetic biology
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:06.000]  So you simply
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:08.000]  The president simply cannot trust
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  Anything
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:12.000]  The National Academy of Sciences said here
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  Everyone is feeding off
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  At the trough here
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:18.000]  Alex
[2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:20.000]  As I said
[2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:22.000]  When I crunched the numbers
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  2015
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:26.000]  It was $100 billion
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:28.000]  And that's $5 billion a year
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  So my guess is as of now
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:32.000]  It's $120 billion
[2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  That has been spent
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:36.000]  And they bought off as of 2015
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:38.000]  $13,000
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  So-called life scientists
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  I call them death scientists
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  To work on this
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:46.000]  And I don't know what the numbers are
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:48.000]  Today
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:50.000]  So they're concurring with what you're saying
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:52.000]  That the best approximation
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:54.000]  Is a bio weapon they were playing around with
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:56.000]  Maybe for a vaccine got out
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  And so many times
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:00.000]  The Russians, the U.S.
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  This stuff just keeps getting out
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:04.000]  And so this is a pretty big disaster
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:06.000]  For the Chai comms and for big pharma
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:08.000]  Here, isn't it?
[2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  Of course
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  And these people
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  Like Fauci, CDC
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  All they want to do
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:18.000]  Is protect the billions of dollars
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:20.000]  They've already wasted
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  On their BSL-3
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:24.000]  And BSL-4
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  Bio warfare weapons labs
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  And everyone else
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:30.000]  Involved in it
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  As for playing around with a vaccine
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  There at that Wuhan
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:36.000]  BSL-4
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  You have to understand
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  The technology involved here
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:42.000]  It was not just that they were playing around
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:44.000]  With a vaccine
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  The way this works out
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:48.000]  Is they first
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  DNA genetically engineer
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  A bio warfare
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:54.000]  Agent
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:56.000]  And that is what we are dealing with here
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:13:58.000]  A bio warfare
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  Agent that is extremely
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  Lethal and extremely
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  Infectious
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  And then once they have the agent
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:08.000]  They then try to
[2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  Develop a vaccine
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:12.000]  To counteract the agent
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  Because that is what a bio warfare
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:16.000]  Weapon really is
[2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:18.000]  And by the way, when you were last on
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  I saw a lot of comments
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  Probably synthetic, they were like
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:24.000]  Of course we have to study this
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  Anyone can make this on their kitchen table
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:28.000]  No, you can't make it on a kitchen table
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:30.000]  It's gene editing
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:32.000]  It's billion dollar technology
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  And they're creating it
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:36.000]  It's ridiculous to say
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  Someone might make it so we've got to make it
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  That's insane
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  And there's a propaganda
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  That these
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  Bio warfare death scientists
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:48.000]  Nye, National Institutes
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  For Health, CDC
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:52.000]  And big pharma have made
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:54.000]  In order to justify
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:14:56.000]  All this Nazi bio warfare work
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  Well, someone might be able to do it
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:00.000]  So we have to be able to study it
[2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  And then we can make the
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  Bio warfare
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:06.000]  Agents so that then we can develop
[2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:08.000]  A vaccine
[2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:10.000]  What's going on here, Alex?
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:12.000]  It's just unbelievable
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  And then as our technology gets more and more advanced
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:16.000]  Well, somebody might make it so we better make it
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  It's that logic
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:20.000]  No, we need to hunt down whoever does it
[2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:22.000]  And stop them, we need to have a convention
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:24.000]  We need to stop it as a moral society
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  And say we're not doing it
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:28.000]  Well unfortunately, Alex
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:30.000]  We have a convention, the biological
[2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  Weapons Convention of 1972
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:34.000]  And then because that convention
[2:15:34.000 --> 2:15:36.000]  Was not drawn up specifically
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:38.000]  Designed with
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:40.000]  To deal with DNA genetic engineering
[2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:42.000]  And or
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:44.000]  Synthetic biology
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  I drafted that
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:48.000]  Implementing legislation
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:50.000]  The biological weapons anti-terrorism act
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:52.000]  Stay there, let's talk about it when we come back
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:54.000]  How about
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:15:56.000]  We can all agree these are troubled times
[2:15:56.000 --> 2:15:58.000]  Right? So do you know who's on
[2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:00.000]  Your wireless network?

[2:16:56.000 --> 2:16:58.000]  Founder of Black Rifle Real Estate
[2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:00.000]  Dot com. Like you, I was a prisoner
[2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:02.000]  In the out-left sanctuary state
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:04.000]  Until one day I chose to lead my family to freedom
[2:17:04.000 --> 2:17:06.000]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:08.000]  Where we shoot, hunt, garden
[2:17:08.000 --> 2:17:10.000]  And homeschool our children
[2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:12.000]  Without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:14.000]  If you're ready to flee the city
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:16.000]  To the freedom of Idaho or Montana
[2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:18.000]  Our Black Rifle Real Estate team is here to help
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:20.000]  Go to blackriflerealestate.com

[2:17:56.000 --> 2:17:58.000]  Alright folks, here's the bad news
[2:17:58.000 --> 2:18:02.000]  We've already sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle with the patented nanotech silver
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:06.000]  That's documented to knock out viruses and bacteria unlike anything else
[2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:10.000]  But we do still have it in the 3 ounce and the 1 ounce for limited time
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:16.000]  The good news is we have the super blue toothpaste and the super silver toothpaste
[2:18:16.000 --> 2:18:19.000]  Both that have the nano silver in them as well
[2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:24.000]  The super blue has tea tree that's also antiviral and antibacterial and high quality iodine
[2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:27.000]  And then of course the whitening has the nano silver
[2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:32.000]  But on top of that it has the above sea coral calcium that remelamorizes the teeth
[2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:35.000]  And so it's just the best toothpaste you're going to find, period
[2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:38.000]  It has the nano silver and we still have supplies of it
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:40.000]  Though it'll sell out at current rates in about 2 weeks
[2:18:40.000 --> 2:18:46.000]  But despite that I'm keeping it at sale at 50% off so everybody can protect themselves
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:47.000]  With this high quality product
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:18:49.000]  You've never used it before, get yours today

[2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  InfowarsStore.com
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:18:58.000]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from Infowars
[2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:02.000]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana
[2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:06.000]  Is a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny
[2:19:06.000 --> 2:19:09.000]  Has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S. but worldwide
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:14.000]  And President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana
[2:19:14.000 --> 2:19:16.000]  And basic liberty is amazing as well
[2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:22.000]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas
[2:19:22.000 --> 2:19:26.000]  But trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China
[2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:30.000]  Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever
[2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:35.000]  We really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective
[2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:40.000]  And the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way
[2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:42.000]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them
[2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:48.000]  But it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:50.000]  That's an attempt to demoralize us
[2:19:50.000 --> 2:20:06.000]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy
[2:20:21.000 --> 2:20:27.000]  But I appreciate him popping in your calls and a bunch of news breaking coming up in the next segment, as promised
[2:20:27.000 --> 2:20:30.000]  So, without me asking the questions here, you're the expert
[2:20:30.000 --> 2:20:35.000]  Right after you come on, right after Senator Cotton says he should be looked at as man-made
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  The Indian Institute saying it looks man-made, showing where it's clearly been gene-edited
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:45.000]  Not getting into whether Fauci's good or not, I respect you, I understand what you're saying
[2:20:45.000 --> 2:20:50.000]  There are responding, and Cotton's come out again, and now the Chinese ambassador
[2:20:50.000 --> 2:20:53.000]  We have that clip, if you haven't seen it, I can play it, you probably have seen it
[2:20:53.000 --> 2:20:58.000]  Comes out and laughs that Trump has his preposterous to say that this could be man-made
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:02.000]  Well, why shouldn't we look at the origin? Why is that being censored?
[2:21:02.000 --> 2:21:08.000]  So what do you think is really going on here and as mainline virologist, mainline academics
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:11.000]  Echo what you've been saying for weeks
[2:21:11.000 --> 2:21:14.000]  I mean, I think that shows that they're concerned because they know this is man-made
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:19.000]  Because clearly there's a major response going on at a level never before seen
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:25.000]  Right Alex, let me get back to my advice to President Trump
[2:21:25.000 --> 2:21:29.000]  And again, I'm not criticizing the president or anything like that
[2:21:29.000 --> 2:21:36.000]  He needs to bring in a team of outside independent experts here
[2:21:36.000 --> 2:21:41.000]  Who have spent their careers opposing biological weapons
[2:21:41.000 --> 2:21:44.000]  And not up to their eyeballs in biological weapons
[2:21:44.000 --> 2:21:47.000]  Sure, because folks that are involved then are going to cover up
[2:21:47.000 --> 2:21:50.000]  Of course they're going to cover it up because the money involved
[2:21:50.000 --> 2:21:55.000]  And this is all CYA because people are going to start to ask
[2:21:55.000 --> 2:22:00.000]  What have you done with that $120 billion we've given you?
[2:22:00.000 --> 2:22:06.000]  So right, the president must put together a team of outside independent experts
[2:22:06.000 --> 2:22:10.000]  Who have spent their careers opposing biological weapons
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:13.000]  And I'm not saying, you know, we are behind this
[2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:21.000]  It's clear, in my opinion, it leaked out of that Wuhan BSL4 facility
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:24.000]  And it is an extremely dangerous biological weapon
[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:29.000]  And the only people who can give President Trump the proper advice
[2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:32.000]  On how to stop it and contain it
[2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:35.000]  For the good of the American people and the good of this country
[2:22:35.000 --> 2:22:40.000]  Are outside independent experts who have never accepted one penny
[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:43.000]  By the way, you've been harping on that, but it's true
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:47.000]  Anyone that's connected to bioweapons production cannot be heard from
[2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:50.000]  Because they have a built-in reason to cover this up
[2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:56.000]  Exactly right, and as I said, the last time I crunched the numbers 2015
[2:22:56.000 --> 2:23:01.000]  There were 13,000, I call them death scientists working on it
[2:23:01.000 --> 2:23:03.000]  So of course they don't have any...
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:05.000]  Let's pull back though
[2:23:05.000 --> 2:23:10.000]  Let's pull back, just as a researcher, as a lawyer, as a historian
[2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:12.000]  How bad do you really think this is going to get?
[2:23:12.000 --> 2:23:15.000]  Because clearly the numbers and things about China aren't accurate
[2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:17.000]  The footage we see is just bedlam
[2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:19.000]  And they're locking other major cities down
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:22.000]  So it looks like this is a bioweapon, as you said
[2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:28.000]  We know it's man-made, so gut level, how bad do you think it's going to get?
[2:23:28.000 --> 2:23:34.000]  Well, Alex, I'm not here to scare people one way or the other
[2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:37.000]  No, but as a father, I want to know your gut level opinion
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:40.000]  Because everything's dead reckoning, I get you can be academic all day
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:44.000]  But just gut level, do you think it's really bad or do you think it's being hyped up?
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:47.000]  It's terrible, it's absolutely terrible
[2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:51.000]  I personally think it'll be a lot worse than the Spanish flu virus
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:57.000]  That being said, however, I think President Trump, if he acts now
[2:23:57.000 --> 2:24:01.000]  Could very well prevent the worst for the United States of America
[2:24:01.000 --> 2:24:05.000]  I'm not sure what can be done for the rest of the world, certainly China
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:10.000]  No, I agree with you, and I think they could be using this to sucker punch Trump
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  If his response isn't strong enough, the way China says, oh, we're going to shoot people at checkpoints
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  But we block a few flights, the media says it's terrible
[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:20.000]  It's like they want this to get bad here
[2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:23.000]  Well, I don't know, Alex
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:28.000]  What I am saying is I believe that if President Trump were to bring in a team of experts
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:34.000]  Who spent their career opposing biological warfare weapons
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:37.000]  Hopefully he could contain this
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:43.000]  Right now, we have 13 people they say were infected
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:48.000]  But they just released these people off the Air Force base
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:53.000]  What about that? They were infected, but they let them go, and now that's crazy
[2:24:53.000 --> 2:24:58.000]  It seems that the latest British Health Authority has said it's 24 days
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:03.000]  And one person was released by a mistake, by an accident
[2:25:03.000 --> 2:25:10.000]  I mean, I don't wish to attribute malice to where it's encompassed
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:16.000]  This is human beings at work, and people make mistakes, Ellen
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:20.000]  But I agree with you, we should be worried about containment
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:26.000]  Instead of political correctness, and we're not really seeing that right now
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:36.000]  I think that's correct, that President Trump needs to undertake a massive campaign in this country of containment
[2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  That is absolutely right
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:45.000]  And the problem is that the mainstream news media refuses to report any of this
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:50.000]  They just go along with the propaganda line by the CBC, WHO
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  Which, as I said before, is working in cahoots with the Chinese government
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:26:00.000]  Now, China did cover this up for months, and that's blown up in their face
[2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:03.000]  So Trump doesn't want to repeat that, there's still time
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  Because if it's not as bad as we think, great, he had a better response
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:10.000]  But I mean, I agree with you, he doesn't want to get caught flat-footed on this
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:15.000]  Let me just give you a personal example, Alex
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:25.000]  I was the first one to publicly blow the whistle that Amerithrax came out of a U.S. government biological warfare laboratory
[2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  That was the first week in November
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:35.000]  And yet, soon after I did, an order was given to silence me
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:43.000]  No mainstream news media ever since then, since November the first week of November 2001 has ever interviewed
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  And for those that don't know, that was the experimental anthrax shot that had admittedly killed so many
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:54.000]  Well, that wasn't the shot, that was anthrax, that was super weapons-grade anthrax
[2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:59.000]  Now remember, you exposed that's what happened, remember they had the anthrax vaccines to kill people
[2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  It seems to, I was involved in that, yes, but this is the Amerithrax after, that was October 2001 after the...
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:12.000]  Sure, you know what, I know you said you could stay a little bit longer
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:17.000]  I'm going to go to the calls, I promise folks, but you should take us back then to the miniaturized Fort Detrick, Maryland
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:23.000]  And then the deaths and the cover-up to remember, because you were there, you were on the show back then, my God
[2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  Yeah, we've been on the show 20 years, it's hard to believe, that yeah, what happened with anthrax, that was a whole other deal
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:34.000]  Plus, I'm not a biologist, but anthrax can live like 20,000 years in the ground
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:38.000]  How do you attenuate anthrax and then put it in somebody's body, of course it doesn't work
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:42.000]  So we'll briefly talk about that with Dr. Francis Boyle, then go to your phone calls
[2:27:42.000 --> 2:27:50.000]  Everybody that is patiently holding here on this February 12th, Wednesday broadcast, this is an incredible time to be alive
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:54.000]  And I will get to Debbie and George and Nick and Wild and JK
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:27:59.000]  JK's up next and then Jordan and Austin after the professor leaves us
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  But yeah, this is just a crazy time to be alive
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  Please remember that we're listed and supported and it's you buying products in forestore.com that makes this whole show possible
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:15.000]  We have sold out of the 16-ounce Amian Gargle with the nano-patented silver that goes after this class of viruses
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:22.000]  But we have the 1-ounce and we have the 3-ounce, 3.4-ounce that are left
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:31.000]  They're about to sell out, but the good news is we have the nano-silver toothpaste in super blue and in super silver
[2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:36.000]  Super silver is the tooth whitening super blue, has the tea tree that's also antiviral as well
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  These are just high quality toothpaste, just good for your mouth, good for your body
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:42.000]  Good to have a good clean palate and it funds the info war
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  This is still 50% off despite the fact that it is set to sell out the next two weeks
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:50.000]  The current sales rates of the Amian Gargles are set to sell out right now
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:53.000]  So please take advantage of those, we'll be right back
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:56.000]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners
[2:28:56.000 --> 2:29:02.000]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:04.000]  This will be the most important message you'll ever hear
[2:29:04.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  Bill Hyde, I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:14.000]  That's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:19.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi
[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:23.000]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[2:29:23.000 --> 2:29:29.000]  And rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable
[2:29:29.000 --> 2:29:31.000]  If you didn't know the floodwaters backstory
[2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:37.000]  So here's what you should do right now, check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com
[2:29:37.000 --> 2:29:43.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com, over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too
[2:29:43.000 --> 2:29:47.000]  And the best part, you're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200
[2:29:47.000 --> 2:29:50.000]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more
[2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:53.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com
[2:29:54.000 --> 2:30:00.000]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half
[2:30:00.000 --> 2:30:03.000]  And I told Alex, I said man this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried
[2:30:03.000 --> 2:30:07.000]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me? You got to get up there and tell people
[2:30:07.000 --> 2:30:15.000]  So here I am telling people, super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried
[2:30:15.000 --> 2:30:18.000]  And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste
[2:30:18.000 --> 2:30:20.000]  And it's fluoride free
[2:30:20.000 --> 2:30:25.000]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this
[2:30:25.000 --> 2:30:31.000]  They feel so clean and the toothpaste, I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this
[2:30:31.000 --> 2:30:33.000]  It feels so good
[2:30:33.000 --> 2:30:37.000]  It feels like good things are happening in my mouth
[2:30:37.000 --> 2:30:43.000]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now
[2:30:43.000 --> 2:31:01.000]  Because I like the way it feels
[2:31:13.000 --> 2:31:18.000]  Pray, stay focused, be involved, keep spreading the word, keep countering their lies
[2:31:18.000 --> 2:31:21.000]  And we have to be prepared in case things go south
[2:31:21.000 --> 2:31:27.000]  That's why it's so critical to go to infowarstore.com and stock up on high quality preparedness items

[2:33:19.000 --> 2:33:24.000]  The tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones Show
[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:42.000]  Alright, finishing up with Dr. Francis Boyle and getting into what he just raised during the last segment
[2:33:42.000 --> 2:33:49.000]  Anthrax, I mean that was US government bio weapons grade
[2:33:49.000 --> 2:33:55.000]  Then a bunch of people, they tried to frame it up, dying in custody and he was right at the heart of exposing that
[2:33:55.000 --> 2:34:01.000]  It's not about Oh, Toot in his horn, he's a mild mannered, shy guy
[2:34:01.000 --> 2:34:04.000]  It's that he's been speaking out for decades, almost right
[2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:09.000]  He's the author of the US Biological Weapons Convention, all of us who's an expert on that
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:13.000]  I'm closing the lessons of Anthrax versus the lessons now
[2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:17.000]  These things pretty much parallel each other, or am I wrong?
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:23.000]  No, that was completely covered up by the United States government, there's no question at all about it
[2:34:23.000 --> 2:34:30.000]  This was super weapons grade Anthrax, it was a trillion spores per gram
[2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:37.000]  It floated in the air, it came out of US government biological warfare laboratory
[2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:42.000]  Just as I said Fort Dietrich for sure
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:47.000]  And yet they covered it up, they tried to blame one fellow he fought back
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:56.000]  Then they pinned the blame on Ivans and basically drove him into suicide and said case closed and that was that
[2:34:56.000 --> 2:35:03.000]  So the problem here, Alex, is that as you correctly pointed out, Anthrax does not degrade
[2:35:03.000 --> 2:35:13.000]  So somewhere there, either at Fort Dietrich or Dugway, there is a stockpile of super weapons grade Anthrax
[2:35:13.000 --> 2:35:19.000]  Like the Amerithrax that they can use again whenever they decide they want to use it again
[2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:23.000]  Right, this is extremely dangerous business
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:28.000]  And there's the whole side issue, again I'm not a biologist but I researched what biologists said
[2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  If the spore of Anthrax lasts thousands of years and you really can't even kill it
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:38.000]  Then how do you inject it to somebody to create an autoimmune response to a vaccine?
[2:35:38.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  No wonder the vaccine killed so many people
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:47.000]  Well that vaccine, yes, was extremely dangerous
[2:35:47.000 --> 2:35:55.000]  What happened was all of a sudden out of nowhere in the run up to the go for one by Bush Sr.
[2:35:55.000 --> 2:36:08.000]  Cheney ordered experimental vaccines for Anthrax and botulism to be inflicted on all of our troops headed for Iraq
[2:36:08.000 --> 2:36:13.000]  Because Cheney knew full well, Cheney being a neocon
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:16.000]  They transferred that to Saddam
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:27.000]  Under Reagan we had already sent the CDC and American-type culture collection 40 shipments of weapons grade
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:40.000]  U.S. military bio warfare agents for Saddam Hussein in the hope and expectation that he would weaponize them and use them against Iraq
[2:36:40.000 --> 2:36:44.000]  And again this is all mad scientist behavior, why would you do that?
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:55.000]  They figured Saddam Hussein would weaponize these biological warfare agents that we gave him and use them against Iran in the Iran-Iraq war
[2:36:55.000 --> 2:37:07.000]  He did not use them but the problem was when the war was over U.S. military forces were just instructed to blow up these biological warfare laboratories
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:15.000]  And of course you can't dispose of biological weapons that way they just dispersed air and they infected our own troops
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:18.000]  Well that's my view on nuclear reactors
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:24.000]  I'm all for nuclear power until I realize the companies never have the upkeep don't care if they leak and just don't care if they blow up
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:27.000]  Well it's like okay we have nuclear power because people are crazy
[2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:29.000]  And like why are you making Anthrax and handing it out?
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:33.000]  It is a mad scientist vein to these people
[2:37:33.000 --> 2:37:37.000]  Just in closing you've been around them you know top PhD in their own programs
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:41.000]  What's up with this mad scientist thing? Why do they even do this?
[2:37:41.000 --> 2:37:45.000]  Because just because I can do something I don't do it, I don't understand it
[2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:52.000]  Well as for most of them it's just greed and selfishness ambition and money
[2:37:52.000 --> 2:37:55.000]  But at the very top it's a different story
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:38:06.000]  I told you I deliberately went through the exact same PhD program at Harvard that produced Kissinger and Brzezinski before me
[2:38:06.000 --> 2:38:18.000]  I wanted to find out how these people thought and how they operated and indeed they gave me Kissinger's old office at Harvard Center for International Affairs when I was there
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:29.000]  These true elites like Kissinger, Brzezinski, Huntington, pretty much everyone coming out of Harvard
[2:38:29.000 --> 2:38:34.000]  Are thoroughly grounded in Machiavelli and the Prince
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  It's that simple
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:40.000]  Indeed Kissinger's colleague there at Harvard
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:46.000]  Professor Stanley Hoffman who was my PhD supervisor has publicly stated
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:50.000]  That Kissinger is thoroughly Machiavellian to the bone
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:57.000]  And that is the type of people that Harvard generates and still generates today
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:39:01.000]  I agree Machiavelli though is the political development or deployment system
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:05.000]  But you were saying last week the operating system is eugenics
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:10.000]  Well that's correct and also it ties into eugenics
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:17.000]  As you know the Rockefeller Foundation was an early proponent of eugenics
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:20.000]  Kissinger was on the payroll of the Rockefeller Foundation
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:22.000]  Sure he pinned memorandum 200
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:25.000]  I mean they met right there population reduction
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:29.000]  That is correct if you read the Kissinger memorandum
[2:39:29.000 --> 2:39:38.000]  It says population reduction shall be a national security objective of the United States of America
[2:39:38.000 --> 2:39:44.000]  I have never read anyone revoking that national security memorandum
[2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:47.000]  Bottom line to get off on playing God
[2:39:47.000 --> 2:39:49.000]  Dr. Boyle thank you for all the time
[2:39:49.000 --> 2:39:52.000]  Please come back again as soon as you can to break this down
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:53.000]  Thank you
[2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:57.000]  Well again Alex I do want to thank you for staying on top of this
[2:39:57.000 --> 2:40:01.000]  I think you're doing a real public service to the American people
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:03.000]  And the United States government
[2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:09.000]  Whatever our political parties, race, creed, national origin may be
[2:40:09.000 --> 2:40:12.000]  This affects all of us and our families
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:13.000]  It certainly does thank you
[2:40:13.000 --> 2:40:15.000]  Yeah I'm just trying to thank you
[2:40:15.000 --> 2:40:17.000]  Don't thank me though for just trying to cover the topics
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:19.000]  I'm just trying to figure out what the hell is going on
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:23.000]  And we're seeing a massive response to this virus
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:27.000]  So it's either the biggest hype we've ever seen or something that's real
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:30.000]  And it's looking like it's real
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:31.000]  We know it's killing some people
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:34.000]  When I say real I mean it looks like it's really lethal
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:36.000]  And we know it's bio weapons grade
[2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:38.000]  We know it's man made
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:40.000]  Notice they don't even deny that now
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:42.000]  They just moved on from there
[2:40:42.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  So we'll come back and do a few segments and just go call call call call call call call call
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:49.000]  So in fact let's just go to one right now
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:52.000]  Let's go to JK in Washington DC
[2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:55.000]  Thanks for holding JK, welcome
[2:40:55.000 --> 2:40:57.000]  Alex can you hear me
[2:40:57.000 --> 2:40:59.000]  I can't go ahead you got two minutes
[2:40:59.000 --> 2:41:03.000]  Two minutes alright so first of all I've been buying your product since 2011
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  And thank you for the product
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:06.000]  Thank you
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:08.000]  Very effective
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:11.000]  So I have yeah give me a few minutes yeah yeah
[2:41:11.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  Okay sorry I'm here at appointment
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:19.000]  I have a colleague at Wuhan University
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  And really I wanted to ask Dr. Boyle also
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:27.000]  But my question is I emailed her and she said she was fine
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:29.000]  But this was like two weeks ago
[2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:31.000]  And then I wanted to collect information
[2:41:31.000 --> 2:41:33.000]  Thinking that she might be getting good information
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:36.000]  And then I thought I don't know what I can say in the email
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:38.000]  Because maybe you know then it would get caught off
[2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:40.000]  So that's really my question
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:45.000]  What kind of an email do I send do I just come out and say it all
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:51.000]  You know what we've learned to somebody who might not know any of this who lives right there
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:57.000]  And I wanted to find out how close to BSL for lab was to Wuhan University
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  Because she's been there for many years she translated my book into Chinese
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:03.000]  About information literacy
[2:42:03.000 --> 2:42:07.000]  And actually got permission from the Ministry of Education
[2:42:07.000 --> 2:42:11.000]  Officially and there's things in the book that I know the communist Chinese wouldn't like
[2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:13.000]  But I don't think it got a lot of attention
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:16.000]  But anyway that's the main thing do I just come out
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:18.000]  Did you ever hear back from her
[2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:21.000]  Yeah she said this was 10 days ago
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:23.000]  She said me and my family are fine thank you
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:26.000]  We're getting a lot of help from around the world
[2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:28.000]  You know and keep me posted
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:30.000]  Yeah I wouldn't overthink sending her stuff
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:32.000]  I don't think she's going to get in trouble
[2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:34.000]  They can't keep control of this
[2:42:34.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  If anything it shows the communists don't run Jack squad
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:39.000]  So just come out and say it all
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:42.000]  Just come out and tell her what we've learned
[2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:45.000]  Well nothing's perfect I would just ask her questions
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:48.000]  Hold on we're going to go to a break we're going to come back JK
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:43:17.000]  Get a final comment from you then everybody else stay with us
[2:43:18.000 --> 2:43:25.000]  We're going to go back to the
[2:43:25.000 --> 2:43:27.000]  We're almost sold out of the one ounce spray bottles
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:30.000]  That will be sold out a couple days and we're about a week and a half or so
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:32.000]  The super silver three ounce bottles
[2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:34.000]  Great to have period really good for your gums
[2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:35.000]  Really great for your teeth
[2:43:35.000 --> 2:43:37.000]  We also have the super silver in our whitening toothpaste
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:40.000]  Again we're the only folks allowed to private label or make our own products
[2:43:40.000 --> 2:43:42.000]  With this top nanotech company based here in the US
[2:43:42.000 --> 2:43:44.000]  That's in all these homeland security documents and everything
[2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:47.000]  Because we get the best stuff there's a lot of patriots
[2:43:47.000 --> 2:43:49.000]  There's not just bad guys coming after us
[2:43:49.000 --> 2:43:52.000]  There's a flip side of all the good guys and good gals
[2:43:52.000 --> 2:43:53.000]  It's very exciting
[2:43:53.000 --> 2:43:58.000]  I have confirmed with high level sources that President Trump is intending
[2:43:58.000 --> 2:44:02.000]  To either pardon Roger Stone after his sentencing or give him clemency
[2:44:02.000 --> 2:44:07.000]  Saying the conviction stands but you now basically don't go to jail
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:09.000]  Either way this is incredibly good news
[2:44:09.000 --> 2:44:12.000]  But let's not forget Julian Assange
[2:44:12.000 --> 2:44:16.000]  That's one of the biggest black marks on Trump is that he famously said
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:18.000]  I don't know who got the emails
[2:44:18.000 --> 2:44:19.000]  I don't know where they came from
[2:44:19.000 --> 2:44:21.000]  The Russians, a fat dude in his mom's basement
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:23.000]  Whoever's got him released him
[2:44:23.000 --> 2:44:25.000]  It's about Hillary committing a crime
[2:44:25.000 --> 2:44:27.000]  Not who has the emails don't change the subject
[2:44:27.000 --> 2:44:30.000]  Well Julian Assange undoubtedly took Trump over the top
[2:44:30.000 --> 2:44:32.000]  The WikiLeaks exposed the deep state
[2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:33.000]  The man is a hero
[2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:35.000]  Daniel Ellsberg was a hero
[2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:37.000]  Well Assange is even a bigger hero
[2:44:37.000 --> 2:44:39.000]  And he's rotting in solitary confinement
[2:44:39.000 --> 2:44:41.000]  And the court hearings can barely talk
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:43.000]  President Trump do the right thing
[2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:45.000]  And asked the British to release Julian Assange
[2:44:45.000 --> 2:44:47.000]  And give him a medal
[2:44:47.000 --> 2:44:50.000]  President Trump you must release Julian Assange
[2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:52.000]  Free Julian Assange
[2:44:52.000 --> 2:44:54.000]  Free Julian Assange
[2:44:54.000 --> 2:44:59.000]  Almost all the other big storable food companies are sold out of food
[2:44:59.000 --> 2:45:01.000]  But I know for a fact from sources to tell them people
[2:45:01.000 --> 2:45:03.000]  Oh we've got it get your order in
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:04.000]  Two weeks for delivery
[2:45:04.000 --> 2:45:06.000]  We follow this pattern over and over again
[2:45:06.000 --> 2:45:08.000]  I've been already for 25 years
[2:45:08.000 --> 2:45:10.000]  I've had storable food for a long time
[2:45:10.000 --> 2:45:12.000]  And I learned very quickly a lot of these companies
[2:45:12.000 --> 2:45:14.000]  They're fine during normal times
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:15.000]  But during a crisis
[2:45:15.000 --> 2:45:17.000]  They don't keep a bunch of food on hand
[2:45:17.000 --> 2:45:18.000]  Because of inventory
[2:45:18.000 --> 2:45:19.000]  They'll still take your orders
[2:45:19.000 --> 2:45:20.000]  That's why about 11 years ago
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:22.000]  I found my Patriot supply
[2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:24.000]  Now the biggest, most trusted company out there
[2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:26.000]  And I became a private labeler for them
[2:45:26.000 --> 2:45:27.000]  Because they actually have it on hand
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:29.000]  They actually give it delivered to you on time
[2:45:29.000 --> 2:45:31.000]  They do what they're going to say they're going to do
[2:45:31.000 --> 2:45:32.000]  Because they want you as a customer
[2:45:32.000 --> 2:45:33.000]  Over and over again
[2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:34.000]  And they're good people
[2:45:34.000 --> 2:45:36.000]  Now they were saying 7 to 10 days before shipping
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:37.000]  Because they've got the food
[2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:39.000]  But they've got a package at record level orders
[2:45:39.000 --> 2:45:41.000]  Now it's 10 to 14
[2:45:41.000 --> 2:45:43.000]  Because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus
[2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:45.000]  So get your orders in an infowarstore.com

[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:07.000]  And to not love Jesus
[2:46:07.000 --> 2:46:08.000]  And of course
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:10.000]  Do not get storable foods
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:13.000]  Or any other types of colloidal nano silver
[2:46:13.000 --> 2:46:16.000]  At infowarstore.com
[2:46:16.000 --> 2:46:18.000]  Do not do it

[2:46:19.000 --> 2:46:21.000]  Trust MSNBC
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:23.000]  Drink fluoridated water
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:27.000]  Just like the loving kiss of a king cobra
[2:46:27.000 --> 2:46:29.000]  Pumping deadly, I mean loving
[2:46:29.000 --> 2:46:32.000]  Helpful nutrients in your body
[2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:34.000]  Hug the cobra
[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:36.000]  Love the cobra
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:37.000]  Kiss the cobra
[2:46:37.000 --> 2:46:39.000]  But never, never
[2:46:39.000 --> 2:46:42.000]  Never go to infowars.com
[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:45.000]  Or infowarsstore.com
[2:46:45.000 --> 2:46:48.000]  Do not order those products
[2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:51.000]  Silenced Jones Show
[2:46:51.000 --> 2:47:18.000]  What is your overall view on what you see happening
[2:47:18.000 --> 2:47:20.000]  And what you see unfolding
[2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:22.000]  With this virus and the big response
[2:47:22.000 --> 2:47:25.000]  What's your gut tell you?
[2:47:25.000 --> 2:47:29.000]  Well, I go with what you guys
[2:47:29.000 --> 2:47:30.000]  I mean the expert
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:32.000]  It was Professor Boyle, right?
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:34.000]  I go by what he said
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:36.000]  So in terms of the gut
[2:47:36.000 --> 2:47:39.000]  I mean there's nothing, it's not good
[2:47:39.000 --> 2:47:42.000]  And I want to communicate with my friend
[2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:45.000]  Like I said, she translated my book
[2:47:45.000 --> 2:47:46.000]  Into Chinese
[2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:49.000]  So, you know, we connected a lot
[2:47:49.000 --> 2:47:51.000]  And so she said her family was five
[2:47:51.000 --> 2:47:52.000]  It was ten days ago
[2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:54.000]  So based on what you said
[2:47:54.000 --> 2:47:57.000]  I'm just going to just email her and see
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:47:59.000]  And say what you just say
[2:47:59.000 --> 2:48:01.000]  All the things that we've learned
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:03.000]  Because I wanted to find out how close
[2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:06.000]  The BSL or lab was to Wuhan University
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:08.000]  Because she lives right around there
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:10.000]  But the other thing Alex
[2:48:10.000 --> 2:48:13.000]  I guess is my gut is about the end times
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:14.000]  So we talked before
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:16.000]  I told you I grew up in a CIA neighborhood
[2:48:16.000 --> 2:48:17.000]  Deep State neighborhood
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:20.000]  I have a letter of recommendation from Henry Kissinger
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:21.000]  Like from 30 years ago
[2:48:21.000 --> 2:48:22.000]  I'm not proud of it
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:24.000]  But I'm in that world
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:26.000]  So I do have to be careful
[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:28.000]  But in terms of the end times
[2:48:28.000 --> 2:48:31.000]  Can I bring that in and say something that I've wanted to say?
[2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:32.000]  We're not screening your call, brother
[2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:33.000]  You're live on radio
[2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:36.000]  Okay Alex, listen
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:39.000]  The end times needs you
[2:48:39.000 --> 2:48:40.000]  And people like you
[2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:42.000]  Who are after the truth
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:43.000]  Who are seeking the truth
[2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:46.000]  But what I want to point out about you
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:50.000]  Is you have an apostle Peter-like personality
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:52.000]  The difference is
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:55.000]  You know Peter chopped off the ear and Jesus
[2:48:55.000 --> 2:48:57.000]  Put it back on
[2:48:57.000 --> 2:48:59.000]  You grew up understanding Jesus
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:01.000]  Or learning about Jesus
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:03.000]  So these times
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:06.000]  Is you're needed for that
[2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:08.000]  And you have a Peter-like
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:10.000]  Apostle Peter-like personality
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:11.000]  And that's not a bad thing
[2:49:11.000 --> 2:49:12.000]  That's a good thing
[2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:13.000]  That's why the guy
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:16.000]  I'm the one who also talked to you about love your enemies
[2:49:16.000 --> 2:49:18.000]  Is probably the strongest weapon
[2:49:18.000 --> 2:49:20.000]  Because it's also a shield
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:21.000]  In the end times
[2:49:21.000 --> 2:49:22.000]  Is love your enemies
[2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:25.000]  That's what separates us from all the bad guys
[2:49:25.000 --> 2:49:26.000]  So you understand that
[2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:28.000]  I knew the guy the other day
[2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:30.000]  Was trying to tell you how not to yell at people
[2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:32.000]  And whatever that's not
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:34.000]  You are who you are
[2:49:34.000 --> 2:49:36.000]  And you say you want to be Christ-like
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:38.000]  Well that's
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:39.000]  I hear you JK
[2:49:39.000 --> 2:49:40.000]  I'm gonna jump
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:41.000]  Really appreciate your call
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:42.000]  Austin and Georgia
[2:49:42.000 --> 2:49:43.000]  They're on the air
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:44.000]  Go ahead
[2:49:44.000 --> 2:49:46.000]  Hey Alice how's it going man
[2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:47.000]  Good brother thanks for holding
[2:49:47.000 --> 2:49:48.000]  Go ahead
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:50.000]  Yes sir
[2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:51.000]  If I can I just
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:49:52.000]  I want to tell you how
[2:49:52.000 --> 2:49:54.000]  I found you online
[2:49:54.000 --> 2:49:56.000]  About five years ago
[2:49:56.000 --> 2:49:58.000]  It was
[2:49:58.000 --> 2:50:00.000]  You know the YouTube rabbit hole
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:02.000]  Just New World Order type
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:04.000]  Videos
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:07.000]  And I saw you with
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:09.000]  Pierce Morgan
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  The interview
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:12.000]  And I was like well this
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:14.000]  This guy's different you know he's
[2:50:14.000 --> 2:50:16.000]  He's
[2:50:16.000 --> 2:50:18.000]  Telling the things that I thought
[2:50:18.000 --> 2:50:20.000]  And
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:21.000]  Well that was a classic
[2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:23.000]  Old Pierce Morgan
[2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:25.000]  Yeah I went to your YouTube
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:27.000]  Page when you still had one
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:31.000]  And I saw the video of you talking about the
[2:50:31.000 --> 2:50:33.000]  Base with the black genocide
[2:50:33.000 --> 2:50:35.000]  With the portions man
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:37.000]  I saw you tear up
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:39.000]  And it was the realest thing I ever seen
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:41.000]  And
[2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:42.000]  I was just
[2:50:42.000 --> 2:50:44.000]  I'm glad you're out there
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:46.000]  Oh we're real brother don't worry Austin
[2:50:46.000 --> 2:50:48.000]  You said what you wanted by them for
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:49.000]  It's real
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:50.000]  We're real
[2:50:50.000 --> 2:50:52.000]  And I love white people
[2:50:52.000 --> 2:50:54.000]  Black people everybody
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  As a white person I don't like the attacks
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:50:57.000]  Saying whites are bad people
[2:50:57.000 --> 2:50:59.000]  But I get it's all manipulation
[2:50:59.000 --> 2:51:01.000]  But then that doesn't mean whites
[2:51:01.000 --> 2:51:02.000]  Then bow down and say we're bad
[2:51:02.000 --> 2:51:04.000]  We need to stand up for ourselves
[2:51:04.000 --> 2:51:06.000]  But everybody needs to stand up for humanity
[2:51:06.000 --> 2:51:07.000]  This is an attack
[2:51:07.000 --> 2:51:09.000]  This whole globalist system is an attack
[2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:10.000]  On our babies
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:12.000]  Doesn't matter what color you are
[2:51:12.000 --> 2:51:13.000]  We need to come together
[2:51:13.000 --> 2:51:15.000]  And forget our differences and deal
[2:51:15.000 --> 2:51:16.000]  With the satanic left
[2:51:16.000 --> 2:51:18.000]  They have to be dealt with
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:20.000]  Yes sir
[2:51:20.000 --> 2:51:21.000]  And
[2:51:21.000 --> 2:51:23.000]  I'm not real sociable
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:24.000]  But anytime
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:26.000]  Like I get on Call of Duty mobile
[2:51:26.000 --> 2:51:27.000]  In my
[2:51:27.000 --> 2:51:28.000]  Xbox Live
[2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:30.000]  I send out Band-Op video
[2:51:30.000 --> 2:51:32.000]  InfoWars.com
[2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:33.000]  From 2020
[2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:36.000]  There's a chat board on Call of Duty mobile
[2:51:36.000 --> 2:51:40.000]  And 50%
[2:51:40.000 --> 2:51:41.000]  Is
[2:51:41.000 --> 2:51:42.000]  You know negative
[2:51:42.000 --> 2:51:43.000]  But the rest
[2:51:43.000 --> 2:51:45.000]  As soon as I put Trump 2020
[2:51:45.000 --> 2:51:47.000]  It just starts flowing
[2:51:47.000 --> 2:51:48.000]  No I agree
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:49.000]  And that's why
[2:51:49.000 --> 2:51:50.000]  Anywhere
[2:51:50.000 --> 2:51:51.000]  You are social
[2:51:51.000 --> 2:51:53.000]  You're online playing games
[2:51:53.000 --> 2:51:54.000]  Your currency
[2:51:54.000 --> 2:51:56.000]  Because you think of that as nothing
[2:51:56.000 --> 2:51:57.000]  I just mentioned InfoWars or Trump
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:51:59.000]  No that's gold
[2:51:59.000 --> 2:52:00.000]  They want to intimidate you
[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:02.000]  And stop you from that human communication
[2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:03.000]  When you spread the word
[2:52:03.000 --> 2:52:04.000]  And do that it's beautiful Austin
[2:52:04.000 --> 2:52:05.000]  Thank you so much
[2:52:05.000 --> 2:52:07.000]  All right moving quick here now
[2:52:07.000 --> 2:52:09.000]  Let's go to Debbie in New Jersey
[2:52:09.000 --> 2:52:10.000]  Debbie thanks for holding
[2:52:10.000 --> 2:52:12.000]  You're on the air worldwide on this
[2:52:12.000 --> 2:52:15.000]  Wednesday edition
[2:52:15.000 --> 2:52:17.000]  I wanted to jump to this instead
[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:19.000]  But my gut feeling about this whole
[2:52:19.000 --> 2:52:21.000]  Coronavirus is that
[2:52:21.000 --> 2:52:23.000]  How bad is it going to affect people
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:25.000]  Here
[2:52:25.000 --> 2:52:27.000]  With all the Monsanto
[2:52:27.000 --> 2:52:29.000]  The fluoride, the chemtrails, the 5G
[2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:31.000]  All the poisoning they're doing
[2:52:31.000 --> 2:52:32.000]  To everybody here
[2:52:32.000 --> 2:52:34.000]  I mean that's equivalent to abortion
[2:52:34.000 --> 2:52:36.000]  How come nobody is saying
[2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:38.000]  Let's have a march for health
[2:52:38.000 --> 2:52:40.000]  Let's stop the poisoning
[2:52:40.000 --> 2:52:42.000]  How bad are we going to be affected?
[2:52:42.000 --> 2:52:44.000]  I agree with you
[2:52:44.000 --> 2:52:46.000]  That something big is going on with this
[2:52:46.000 --> 2:52:48.000]  And I don't think this is all just type
[2:52:48.000 --> 2:52:50.000]  And who knows what it could be a cover for
[2:52:50.000 --> 2:52:51.000]  Could be something else
[2:52:51.000 --> 2:52:53.000]  What do you think?
[2:52:53.000 --> 2:52:55.000]  I think the same thing
[2:52:55.000 --> 2:52:57.000]  But it frightens me because
[2:52:57.000 --> 2:53:00.000]  We have so many family members
[2:53:00.000 --> 2:53:02.000]  That like Rob Dewis said
[2:53:02.000 --> 2:53:04.000]  You have said we can't wake up
[2:53:04.000 --> 2:53:06.000]  We can't get them out of their trance
[2:53:06.000 --> 2:53:08.000]  We've tried to turn them on to your product
[2:53:08.000 --> 2:53:10.000]  We've given them people
[2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:11.000]  Turn their heads
[2:53:11.000 --> 2:53:12.000]  I don't want to buy from him
[2:53:12.000 --> 2:53:13.000]  He's Alex Jones
[2:53:13.000 --> 2:53:15.000]  How are we supposed to help these people?
[2:53:15.000 --> 2:53:17.000]  It really upsets me
[2:53:17.000 --> 2:53:19.000]  Well don't listen it's okay
[2:53:19.000 --> 2:53:20.000]  Because it's never going to be the majority
[2:53:20.000 --> 2:53:21.000]  That's awake early leaders
[2:53:21.000 --> 2:53:23.000]  They pre-program against anybody
[2:53:23.000 --> 2:53:24.000]  That's good like Trump
[2:53:24.000 --> 2:53:25.000]  That's why Trump's so good
[2:53:25.000 --> 2:53:28.000]  He's broke through all their BS
[2:53:28.000 --> 2:53:29.000]  People know it's not true
[2:53:29.000 --> 2:53:31.000]  And then I think they're getting weaker
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:32.000]  While we get stronger
[2:53:32.000 --> 2:53:35.000]  But I hear you don't let it demoralize you Debbie
[2:53:35.000 --> 2:53:37.000]  Just know that what they say about us
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:38.000]  Isn't true
[2:53:38.000 --> 2:53:39.000]  What they say about you isn't true
[2:53:39.000 --> 2:53:40.000]  And I just think in the end
[2:53:40.000 --> 2:53:41.000]  That things are going to turn okay
[2:53:41.000 --> 2:53:45.000]  But they want to bring the economy down
[2:53:45.000 --> 2:53:47.000]  To destroy Trump
[2:53:47.000 --> 2:53:49.000]  My concern is this virus is already starting
[2:53:49.000 --> 2:53:50.000]  To do that
[2:53:50.000 --> 2:53:53.000]  And how do they try to blame Trump
[2:53:53.000 --> 2:53:54.000]  With the virus?
[2:53:54.000 --> 2:53:55.000]  That's my biggest concern
[2:53:55.000 --> 2:53:56.000]  I thought the same thing
[2:53:56.000 --> 2:53:58.000]  And I was also going to say
[2:53:58.000 --> 2:54:00.000]  Why doesn't he utilize the black ops teams
[2:54:00.000 --> 2:54:01.000]  The mercenaries
[2:54:01.000 --> 2:54:04.000]  Those are the trained killers he needs
[2:54:04.000 --> 2:54:06.000]  The problem is he's surrounded by traders
[2:54:06.000 --> 2:54:07.000]  He can't trust any of them
[2:54:07.000 --> 2:54:09.000]  But we're entering a wheelhouse now
[2:54:09.000 --> 2:54:11.000]  Where the deep state keeps trying to overthrow him
[2:54:11.000 --> 2:54:13.000]  Where he won't have a choice
[2:54:13.000 --> 2:54:16.000]  Which I don't think we should even be happy about this
[2:54:16.000 --> 2:54:17.000]  But it is where it is
[2:54:17.000 --> 2:54:19.000]  They're bringing us to a place
[2:54:19.000 --> 2:54:20.000]  We don't want to go
[2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:21.000]  But we didn't take us there
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:23.000]  So it's not our fault once we get there
[2:54:23.000 --> 2:54:24.000]  Does that make sense?
[2:54:24.000 --> 2:54:26.000]  Yeah, no it does
[2:54:26.000 --> 2:54:29.000]  Thank you for taking me still a little better
[2:54:29.000 --> 2:54:30.000]  Oh, Debbie, you're awesome
[2:54:30.000 --> 2:54:31.000]  God bless you, you've called before
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:34.000]  I recognize your voice, thank you
[2:54:34.000 --> 2:54:36.000]  Alright, let's go to
[2:54:36.000 --> 2:54:38.000]  Georgia, New York
[2:54:38.000 --> 2:54:39.000]  A little bit north of New Jersey
[2:54:39.000 --> 2:54:40.000]  You're on the air, George
[2:54:40.000 --> 2:54:41.000]  Thanks for holding
[2:54:41.000 --> 2:54:44.000]  Yes, Alex, you were talking about it before
[2:54:44.000 --> 2:54:46.000]  The guys we got to get out of there
[2:54:46.000 --> 2:54:50.000]  Osoros, Obama, Brennan, Clapper
[2:54:50.000 --> 2:54:51.000]  And the Clintons
[2:54:51.000 --> 2:54:53.000]  And then the rest are going to fall like dominoes
[2:54:53.000 --> 2:54:54.000]  That's it
[2:54:54.000 --> 2:54:57.000]  We don't need a big Marines invade D.C.
[2:54:57.000 --> 2:54:58.000]  We just got to go after the snake
[2:54:58.000 --> 2:55:00.000]  And I'm not saying we're going to do it
[2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:01.000]  And I'll say it for a place of fear
[2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:02.000]  It's not our place
[2:55:02.000 --> 2:55:05.000]  Trump needs to cut the head off the snake
[2:55:05.000 --> 2:55:09.000]  And we only got four more years of Trump
[2:55:09.000 --> 2:55:12.000]  What happens after the four years, Alex?
[2:55:12.000 --> 2:55:14.000]  Then we're back to square one
[2:55:14.000 --> 2:55:17.000]  Isn't it crazy that we actually have a president
[2:55:17.000 --> 2:55:18.000]  That's trying to be president?
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:19.000]  No, I agree
[2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:21.000]  Hell, they might election fraud
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:24.000]  We have 264 days for sure, brother
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:25.000]  Right
[2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:29.000]  And we can't call them Democrats no more
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:30.000]  We've got to stop it
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:31.000]  It's demon rats
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:32.000]  This is the new word
[2:55:32.000 --> 2:55:33.000]  Demon rats
[2:55:33.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  We need to call them demon rats
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:36.000]  No, I agree
[2:55:36.000 --> 2:55:39.000]  When a party says they don't want the country to exist
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:40.000]  Which would bankrupt everybody
[2:55:40.000 --> 2:55:42.000]  Just from a financial level
[2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:44.000]  What do you do with people like that?
[2:55:44.000 --> 2:55:45.000]  It's not like we want to fight with them
[2:55:45.000 --> 2:55:47.000]  But don't we have to kick their ass
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:48.000]  Prove we're tough
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:50.000]  But they keep asking for it
[2:55:50.000 --> 2:55:53.000]  Also, we can't let lawyers run this country
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:55:56.000]  This is what's been going on with it
[2:55:56.000 --> 2:55:58.000]  The small guy like me
[2:55:58.000 --> 2:56:00.000]  You can't fight
[2:56:00.000 --> 2:56:02.000]  Because everything is you need a lawyer
[2:56:02.000 --> 2:56:04.000]  You need a lawyer for this or lawyer for that
[2:56:04.000 --> 2:56:07.000]  So they are ruining this country, these lawyers
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:09.000]  You're right, they paralyzed the nation
[2:56:09.000 --> 2:56:11.000]  Well, they're getting their asses kicked right now
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:14.000]  I mean, the lawyers thought they could remove Trump
[2:56:14.000 --> 2:56:16.000]  How'd that go for them?
[2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:17.000]  Right
[2:56:17.000 --> 2:56:19.000]  But look at Roger Stone
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:21.000]  Look at Julian Assange
[2:56:21.000 --> 2:56:24.000]  I mean, if you're on Trump's side
[2:56:24.000 --> 2:56:25.000]  They go after you
[2:56:25.000 --> 2:56:27.000]  They go after the good people
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:28.000]  So a lot of people like us
[2:56:28.000 --> 2:56:30.000]  We got to keep our mouths shut
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:34.000]  Because we don't have the firepower to hire lawyers
[2:56:34.000 --> 2:56:35.000]  I agree with George
[2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:37.000]  Great point, God bless you
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:39.000]  It was probably like eight, nine months ago
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:41.000]  They had the Department of Justice
[2:56:41.000 --> 2:56:42.000]  Under these people
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:44.000]  Investigating my dad who did nothing
[2:56:44.000 --> 2:56:45.000]  He's not even involved with the company much
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:48.000]  He does some bookkeeping and then product development
[2:56:48.000 --> 2:56:50.000]  But they knew I love my dad
[2:56:50.000 --> 2:56:52.000]  I told them, I told them, I said,
[2:56:52.000 --> 2:56:54.000]  Dad, you ready to go to prison?
[2:56:54.000 --> 2:56:55.000]  He goes, yeah, I'm ready
[2:56:55.000 --> 2:56:57.000]  I go, yeah, we're not backing down
[2:56:57.000 --> 2:56:59.000]  And the system was like, really?
[2:56:59.000 --> 2:57:01.000]  You don't care about your daddy?
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:05.000]  And I said, he's an old man, he's ready to go
[2:57:05.000 --> 2:57:08.000]  I said, you can literally...
[2:57:08.000 --> 2:57:09.000]  I went crazy, actually
[2:57:09.000 --> 2:57:11.000]  I'm not going to get into what happened behind the scenes
[2:57:11.000 --> 2:57:14.000]  But they realized I don't care about me
[2:57:14.000 --> 2:57:16.000]  So they thought they'd mess with my dad
[2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:18.000]  And my dad was like, destroy me
[2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:20.000]  He was totally made up
[2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:22.000]  They were like, we're going to indict your father
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:25.000]  And that's the level of the scum
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:28.000]  You cannot even imagine the filth
[2:57:28.000 --> 2:57:30.000]  And you just think you're Jesus
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:32.000]  Every moment that you weren't born
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:34.000]  To families like these people
[2:57:34.000 --> 2:57:37.000]  Who are the greatest scum the planet has ever seen
[2:57:37.000 --> 2:57:40.000]  They are self-loathing pieces of crap
[2:57:40.000 --> 2:57:48.000]  If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate info wars
[2:57:48.000 --> 2:57:52.000]  It's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate
[2:57:52.000 --> 2:57:55.000]  And we're not giving up
[2:57:55.000 --> 2:57:58.000]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware
[2:57:58.000 --> 2:58:00.000]  Of the New World Order's plans
[2:58:00.000 --> 2:58:02.000]  To not get down when they attack us
[2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:04.000]  And they persecute us and they lie about us
[2:58:04.000 --> 2:58:06.000]  That's what we should expect
[2:58:06.000 --> 2:58:09.000]  Because we are hurting these scumbags
[2:58:09.000 --> 2:58:12.000]  The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side
[2:58:12.000 --> 2:58:15.000]  And they do what they do because they're slaves
[2:58:15.000 --> 2:58:19.000]  Because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate
[2:58:19.000 --> 2:58:21.000]  And destroy the innocent
[2:58:21.000 --> 2:58:23.000]  It is up to us who are awake
[2:58:23.000 --> 2:58:25.000]  Not the sheep and not the wolves
[2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:28.000]  But the sheepdogs to stand firm
[2:58:28.000 --> 2:58:31.000]  And resist these wicked tyrants
[2:58:31.000 --> 2:58:33.000]  They fear the fact that we are awake
[2:58:33.000 --> 2:58:36.000]  They fear the fact that we are alive
[2:58:36.000 --> 2:58:39.000]  They fear the fact that we love God
[2:58:39.000 --> 2:58:41.000]  And that's all we ever have to know
[2:58:41.000 --> 2:58:43.000]  Is that God is in charge
[2:58:46.000 --> 2:58:48.000]  Alright folks, here's the bad news
[2:58:48.000 --> 2:58:50.000]  We've already sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle
[2:58:50.000 --> 2:58:52.000]  With the patented nanotech silver
[2:58:52.000 --> 2:58:54.000]  That's documented to knock out viruses and bacteria
[2:58:54.000 --> 2:58:56.000]  Unlike anything else
[2:58:56.000 --> 2:58:59.000]  But we do still have it in the 3 ounce
[2:58:59.000 --> 2:59:01.000]  And the 1 ounce for limited time
[2:59:01.000 --> 2:59:04.000]  The good news is we have the super blue toothpaste
[2:59:04.000 --> 2:59:06.000]  And the super silver toothpaste
[2:59:06.000 --> 2:59:08.000]  Both that have the nano silver in them as well
[2:59:08.000 --> 2:59:10.000]  The super blue has tea tree
[2:59:10.000 --> 2:59:12.000]  That's also antiviral and antibacterial
[2:59:12.000 --> 2:59:14.000]  And high quality iodine
[2:59:14.000 --> 2:59:17.000]  And then of course the whitening has the nano silver
[2:59:17.000 --> 2:59:20.000]  But on top of that it has the above sea coral calcium
[2:59:20.000 --> 2:59:22.000]  That remelamorizes the teeth
[2:59:22.000 --> 2:59:24.000]  And so it's just the best toothpaste you're going to find
[2:59:24.000 --> 2:59:26.000]  Period, it has the nano silver
[2:59:26.000 --> 2:59:28.000]  And we still have supplies of it
[2:59:28.000 --> 2:59:30.000]  Though it'll sell out at current rates in about 2 weeks
[2:59:30.000 --> 2:59:32.000]  But despite that I'm keeping it at sale
[2:59:32.000 --> 2:59:34.000]  At 50% off
[2:59:34.000 --> 2:59:36.000]  So everybody can protect themselves
[2:59:36.000 --> 2:59:38.000]  With this high quality product
[2:59:38.000 --> 2:59:40.000]  You've never used it before, get yours today
[2:59:40.000 --> 2:59:42.000]  InfowarsStore.com
[2:59:42.000 --> 3:00:04.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:00:04.000 --> 3:00:10.000]  Are we some little porno leather right now?
[3:00:10.000 --> 3:00:12.000]  What the hell is this?
[3:00:12.000 --> 3:00:14.000]  You guys are out of control
[3:00:14.000 --> 3:00:18.000]  Two final phone calls for a bunch out of here
[3:00:18.000 --> 3:00:22.000]  And that Mike Adams always informative taking over
[3:00:22.000 --> 3:00:26.000]  Nick in Massachusetts, you're on the air, go ahead
[3:00:26.000 --> 3:00:28.000]  Hi Alex
[3:00:28.000 --> 3:00:30.000]  Welcome Nick
[3:00:30.000 --> 3:00:34.000]  Hi, I just wanted to say that I've been listening to you since
[3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:38.000]  I want to say that Jesse Ventura conspiracy theory show
[3:00:38.000 --> 3:00:40.000]  I want to say thank you for
[3:00:40.000 --> 3:00:44.000]  Opening my eyes to the real evil of the world
[3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:48.000]  And I just had a comment about the coronavirus
[3:00:48.000 --> 3:00:52.000]  And what I think that the UN is going to probably start making laws
[3:00:52.000 --> 3:00:57.000]  For us to force vaccines to whatever they want to put into our bodies
[3:00:57.000 --> 3:00:59.000]  And however they want to manipulate our genes
[3:00:59.000 --> 3:01:03.000]  And I don't know if you've seen recently on the MSN website
[3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:08.000]  That Bill Gates has got this $645 million super yacht
[3:01:08.000 --> 3:01:13.000]  And I know you've been saying for years that when they decided to start this push
[3:01:13.000 --> 3:01:15.000]  Of the populated people that
[3:01:15.000 --> 3:01:18.000]  These super rich are just going to jump on these mega yachts
[3:01:18.000 --> 3:01:20.000]  And just ride around the ocean
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:23.000]  Oh that's it, it's not like Moonraker where they go out to space to do it
[3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:27.000]  They're going to sit on their yachts while we all die, absolutely
[3:01:27.000 --> 3:01:30.000]  They're not going to wait in bunkers underground
[3:01:30.000 --> 3:01:33.000]  Underground bases, they're going to be on their yachts, yes
[3:01:33.000 --> 3:01:39.000]  And I just wanted to comment that with the picture that the MSN has been showing around
[3:01:39.000 --> 3:01:44.000]  It actually looks like the arcs that they've made in the movie 2012
[3:01:44.000 --> 3:01:50.000]  I don't know if you're familiar with the movie, but they look like a spaceship
[3:01:50.000 --> 3:01:58.000]  And it's like the first hydrogen powered yacht that they're going to be selling
[3:01:58.000 --> 3:02:04.000]  But I just wanted to say thank you from a small town in Oxford, Massachusetts
[3:02:04.000 --> 3:02:08.000]  And just want to let you know that your words are coming up to this way
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:11.000]  Nick, I want to thank you brother, that's what it's all about, we love you
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:13.000]  And I appreciate you, thanks for the call
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:16.000]  Alright, Jordan in New Jersey, you're our last caller
[3:02:16.000 --> 3:02:20.000]  Before Mike Adams takes over, go ahead sir
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:23.000]  Hi Alex, Jordan Brewster here, how are you?
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:25.000]  Man, it's a crazy time to be alive
[3:02:25.000 --> 3:02:29.000]  I just remembered that movie 2012 and the yachts look like escape pods
[3:02:29.000 --> 3:02:31.000]  And that's just what Bill Gates' yacht looks like
[3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:33.000]  I'm like, what the hell is going on here?
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:35.000]  It's pretty crazy
[3:02:35.000 --> 3:02:38.000]  Yeah, well you've seen a lot and I've been with you a long time
[3:02:38.000 --> 3:02:41.000]  You know, since about I guess 9-11
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:45.000]  So when my eyes got opened and I had a journey with me
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:48.000]  So I just want to start with
[3:02:48.000 --> 3:02:53.000]  I just want to implore you and all the other independent media out there
[3:02:53.000 --> 3:02:58.000]  And all citizen journalists not to merely react to the barrage of world events
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:03:01.000]  Both created and natural
[3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:05.000]  No, I agree, how are we proactive? How do we get ahead of it?
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:08.000]  Yeah, this is my suggestion to all this
[3:03:08.000 --> 3:03:12.000]  I'm an attorney, I also have a master's in information library science
[3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:16.000]  It's very key that we try to hone something called information literacy
[3:03:16.000 --> 3:03:18.000]  Which I think that you do as best you can
[3:03:18.000 --> 3:03:23.000]  But you have to deal with a barrage of a 24-hour 24-7 news cycle
[3:03:23.000 --> 3:03:28.000]  So I mean, lest we forget the anthrax attacks that we just heard about
[3:03:28.000 --> 3:03:31.000]  That we all remember this thing about unfortunately with your last guest
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:35.000]  Cesar Sayoc Jr. with the pipe bombs
[3:03:35.000 --> 3:03:39.000]  The uptick to the whole House of Representatives election
[3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:42.000]  And obviously the El Paso shooting
[3:03:42.000 --> 3:03:45.000]  They're going to launch false flags
[3:03:45.000 --> 3:03:48.000]  Yes, and we need something to sit
[3:03:48.000 --> 3:03:51.000]  Whether it be an institute or 501c3
[3:03:51.000 --> 3:03:54.000]  Formed by folks like you and other like-minded people
[3:03:54.000 --> 3:03:57.000]  To go ahead and examine these things in long durations
[3:03:57.000 --> 3:03:59.000]  You've done some very good films
[3:03:59.000 --> 3:04:02.000]  You haven't really had the time to do your last good film Endgame
[3:04:02.000 --> 3:04:06.000]  Which is to me the last really big effort that you were able to do
[3:04:06.000 --> 3:04:11.000]  They don't want us studying these events because so many times they're staged
[3:04:11.000 --> 3:04:13.000]  Precisely
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:16.000]  What happened is they continuously manipulate the public
[3:04:16.000 --> 3:04:19.000]  Because of the shorter attention span and so forth
[3:04:19.000 --> 3:04:22.000]  But history commons, I don't know if you ever went to that site
[3:04:22.000 --> 3:04:27.000]  But they put together many great timelines starting at 9-11 and so forth
[3:04:27.000 --> 3:04:30.000]  Although it's not very palpable to the average citizen
[3:04:30.000 --> 3:04:33.000]  So through the prism of something called information literacy
[3:04:33.000 --> 3:04:36.000]  Something I studied as an information scientist student
[3:04:36.000 --> 3:04:38.000]  And did my doctorate on basically there
[3:04:38.000 --> 3:04:40.000]  I'll tell you what, give us your name and number
[3:04:40.000 --> 3:04:42.000]  You'll be our first guest caller tomorrow at 11.30
[3:04:42.000 --> 3:04:45.000]  If you'll do it, come on for a couple of seconds with us tomorrow
[3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:47.000]  I really appreciate you, George, you're a smart guy
[3:04:47.000 --> 3:04:50.000]  Get his name and number, tomorrow at 11.30 he'll do it
[3:04:50.000 --> 3:05:13.000]  He's on, stay with us
[3:05:21.000 --> 3:05:25.000]  This is beautiful, it's happening but we need to see a lot more
[3:05:25.000 --> 3:05:27.000]  All the neocons need to be fired
[3:05:27.000 --> 3:05:30.000]  All the Obama appointees fired
[3:05:30.000 --> 3:05:33.000]  All the deep state globalists who have resumes with George Soros
[3:05:33.000 --> 3:05:36.000]  Fired, fired, fired, fired
[3:05:36.000 --> 3:05:38.000]  Trump is finally unleashed
[3:05:38.000 --> 3:05:40.000]  Trump is not the red wave
[3:05:40.000 --> 3:05:42.000]  He is the red storm
[3:05:42.000 --> 3:05:45.000]  An info wars is the tip of the spear
[3:05:45.000 --> 3:05:47.000]  Powered by we the people
[3:05:47.000 --> 3:05:50.000]  Never backing down, never giving in
[3:05:50.000 --> 3:06:18.000]  A frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order
[3:06:18.000 --> 3:06:25.000]  Let me just say the callers to this show are truly amazing
[3:06:25.000 --> 3:06:28.000]  It's amazing how much information that you get
[3:06:28.000 --> 3:06:31.000]  And how you're observing and you're thinking critically about the world
[3:06:31.000 --> 3:06:34.000]  And yet you live in a world and you know this
[3:06:34.000 --> 3:06:37.000]  Where so many people, their eyes just glaze over
[3:06:37.000 --> 3:06:42.000]  They're hypnotized into zombie status somehow
[3:06:42.000 --> 3:06:45.000]  I was actually talking last night in a private conversation
[3:06:45.000 --> 3:06:49.000]  With a very high level finance person
[3:06:49.000 --> 3:06:52.000]  Who's a big name, you would know them
[3:06:52.000 --> 3:06:58.000]  They work with people who manage, I don't know, hundreds of billions of dollars
[3:06:58.000 --> 3:07:01.000]  And they were asking for my take on things
[3:07:01.000 --> 3:07:03.000]  Because they said they were talking to people
[3:07:03.000 --> 3:07:06.000]  And it was like talking to zombies
[3:07:06.000 --> 3:07:10.000]  And I said yes, those people are what we call non-player characters
[3:07:10.000 --> 3:07:14.000]  NPCs from the old role playing games
[3:07:14.000 --> 3:07:20.000]  NPCs, or also known as programmable life forms, PLFs
[3:07:20.000 --> 3:07:24.000]  It's because they have no soul, they literally have no soul
[3:07:24.000 --> 3:07:27.000]  They are programmed empty skin bags
[3:07:27.000 --> 3:07:29.000]  And there's a whole bunch of those in society
[3:07:29.000 --> 3:07:31.000]  And you encounter them, you know it when you do it
[3:07:31.000 --> 3:07:34.000]  When someone, you're talking to someone
[3:07:34.000 --> 3:07:37.000]  Their eyes are open but no one's home
[3:07:37.000 --> 3:07:39.000]  And you're trying to explain things
[3:07:39.000 --> 3:07:44.000]  They're like, hey, this coronavirus, you know, this thing, it's spreading, it's doubling about every week
[3:07:44.000 --> 3:07:48.000]  It's spreading like crazy, there's a massive cover-up, it's a biological weapon
[3:07:48.000 --> 3:07:53.000]  And then they turn to you and say something like, well, I don't feel like it's going to be that bad
[3:07:53.000 --> 3:07:57.000]  Like really, I'm not sure that the virus cares about what you feel about things
[3:07:57.000 --> 3:08:03.000]  It's almost so bad that if there were an asteroid hurtling toward planet Earth
[3:08:03.000 --> 3:08:08.000]  Moving at a relative velocity of, let's say, 30,000 meters per second
[3:08:08.000 --> 3:08:13.000]  100 miles wide and all the scientists say it's going to hit New York City
[3:08:13.000 --> 3:08:15.000]  Let's just say theoretically
[3:08:15.000 --> 3:08:19.000]  And you would go across New York, but let's say it's going to hit in 30 days
[3:08:19.000 --> 3:08:25.000]  If you were to go to New York with a microphone and ask people, hey, what do you think about that giant asteroid
[3:08:25.000 --> 3:08:29.000]  That's going to hit the city here and basically destroy all life on Earth
[3:08:29.000 --> 3:08:34.000]  What do you think about that? You would find people that would say, ah, I don't think it's going to be that bad
[3:08:34.000 --> 3:08:42.000]  They would literally line up and say, ah, I'm not seeing it, I don't see it, I look at the sky, it's not there
[3:08:42.000 --> 3:08:45.000]  There would be people who would say, nothing bad is going to happen
[3:08:45.000 --> 3:08:50.000]  Or they would say, ah, don't worry, FEMA is going to bring us bottled water after the meteor hits
[3:08:50.000 --> 3:08:53.000]  And you would explain to them the rules of cause and effect
[3:08:53.000 --> 3:08:59.000]  You would explain that kinetic energy is one-half mass times velocity squared
[3:08:59.000 --> 3:09:07.000]  And if the velocity is 30,000 meters per second and the mass of an asteroid that's 100 miles wide is not just huge
[3:09:07.000 --> 3:09:11.000]  Then this thing is a planet killer that's going to kill the whole planet
[3:09:11.000 --> 3:09:15.000]  You would explain that to them and you would say it's heading here, it's going to hit here
[3:09:15.000 --> 3:09:21.000]  And even if they believe those facts, they would still say, ah, it's probably not going to be that bad
[3:09:21.000 --> 3:09:24.000]  So this is what's happening in our world
[3:09:24.000 --> 3:09:29.000]  Whether we're talking about the coronavirus or the coming financial collapse that will happen
[3:09:29.000 --> 3:09:32.000]  Probably within our lifetimes, we don't know what year, we don't know when
[3:09:32.000 --> 3:09:35.000]  But fiat currencies collapse, it's going to be devastating
[3:09:35.000 --> 3:09:37.000]  The debt pyramid will collapse
[3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:40.000]  The spread of this disease, it's devastating
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:47.000]  But the average person does not prepare because they can't fathom these things happening
[3:09:47.000 --> 3:09:51.000]  So in this hour today here on Infowars
[3:09:51.000 --> 3:09:57.000]  I'm going to share with you why you don't have to be worried about the coronavirus killing you
[3:09:57.000 --> 3:10:05.000]  Because I will talk about some natural molecules found in nature that easily halt this virus
[3:10:05.000 --> 3:10:08.000]  I've been doing some research on this, working in my lab
[3:10:08.000 --> 3:10:13.000]  We know about some natural cures already, things that work, things that you can do today
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:18.000]  That doesn't require buying anything, just changing what you eat, I'll talk about that here
[3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:21.000]  But realize that other people won't be prepared
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:26.000]  Other people are living on total junk food, they don't believe in nutrition
[3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:30.000]  And they don't believe that this virus is spreading because for some reason
[3:10:30.000 --> 3:10:33.000]  They think that communists in China always tell the truth
[3:10:33.000 --> 3:10:37.000]  Which is insane, they think that WHO is telling the truth
[3:10:37.000 --> 3:10:43.000]  So the real big picture here folks is that this virus probably won't kill you
[3:10:43.000 --> 3:10:47.000]  Because you will be informed, because you're a listener to this show
[3:10:47.000 --> 3:10:50.000]  You read websites that help keep you informed
[3:10:50.000 --> 3:10:53.000]  We can teach you how to survive this, it's not that difficult
[3:10:53.000 --> 3:10:57.000]  Even if you do nothing, your chances of survival are 83%
[3:10:57.000 --> 3:11:02.000]  Because it's about a 17% kill rate, maybe a 15% kill rate
[3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:06.000]  So that means your chances of survival are 83 to 85%
[3:11:06.000 --> 3:11:12.000]  If you do nothing, if you take some nutrients and change what you eat
[3:11:12.000 --> 3:11:14.000]  And do some of the things I'll recommend here
[3:11:14.000 --> 3:11:21.000]  Your chances of surviving an infection go up in my assessment to at least 99%
[3:11:21.000 --> 3:11:24.000]  At least 99%, maybe even better
[3:11:24.000 --> 3:11:28.000]  So you are extremely unlikely to be killed by this virus
[3:11:28.000 --> 3:11:30.000]  Even if it spreads all across America
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:33.000]  Even if it infects 60% of the global population
[3:11:33.000 --> 3:11:37.000]  As has been warned by Dr. Leong out of Hong Kong
[3:11:37.000 --> 3:11:43.000]  But your chances of being clobbered by the downfall of society
[3:11:43.000 --> 3:11:45.000]  Are much higher than 1%
[3:11:45.000 --> 3:11:50.000]  Because when other people get sick and other people don't prepare
[3:11:50.000 --> 3:11:54.000]  And then they panic and go to the grocery store to buy food that isn't there
[3:11:54.000 --> 3:11:56.000]  Because they don't have any storable food
[3:11:56.000 --> 3:11:59.000]  They freak out because they've never thought about self-reliance
[3:11:59.000 --> 3:12:01.000]  They depend on the government
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:03.000]  And they think the government is going to come save them
[3:12:03.000 --> 3:12:05.000]  And they don't even have a means of self-defense
[3:12:05.000 --> 3:12:11.000]  Those unprepared masses are the biggest threat to your safety and survival
[3:12:11.000 --> 3:12:13.000]  So that's the theme of today's show here
[3:12:13.000 --> 3:12:16.000]  At least the hour that I have been given
[3:12:16.000 --> 3:12:21.000]  And that I humbly serve the audience of Infowars here today
[3:12:21.000 --> 3:12:24.000]  The theme of it is, you won't be killed by the virus
[3:12:24.000 --> 3:12:26.000]  Do some simple things we'll talk about
[3:12:26.000 --> 3:12:30.000]  But you're still living in a world where most people are unprepared
[3:12:30.000 --> 3:12:32.000]  They're unprepared for the pandemic
[3:12:32.000 --> 3:12:35.000]  They're unprepared for a grid down collapse
[3:12:35.000 --> 3:12:38.000]  A solar flare, an EMP weapon
[3:12:38.000 --> 3:12:41.000]  Totally unprepared for a financial collapse and all the other things
[3:12:41.000 --> 3:12:43.000]  Scenarios that we've talked about over the years
[3:12:43.000 --> 3:12:48.000]  So your job is to think beyond the pandemic
[3:12:48.000 --> 3:12:53.000]  Think beyond the coronavirus and think about secondary effects
[3:12:53.000 --> 3:12:55.000]  And how those could impact your life
[3:12:55.000 --> 3:12:57.000]  This is the time to be a prepper
[3:12:57.000 --> 3:13:01.000]  This is the time to have extra supplies before they're sold out
[3:13:01.000 --> 3:13:06.000]  This is the time to take steps for self-reliance
[3:13:06.000 --> 3:13:09.000]  But do not depend on Dialing 9-1-1
[3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:12.000]  And having people show up to rescue you
[3:13:12.000 --> 3:13:14.000]  Because that is very unlikely to happen
[3:13:14.000 --> 3:13:17.000]  I'm also going to talk today about how China is certain
[3:13:17.000 --> 3:13:23.000]  To turn this into a biological weapons attack against the United States
[3:13:23.000 --> 3:13:27.000]  Because if you think about this, after this sweeps through China
[3:13:27.000 --> 3:13:30.000]  They may lose 15% of their population
[3:13:30.000 --> 3:13:35.000]  But after that's done, all Chinese in mainland China are now immune
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:38.000]  Because you're either dead or you're immune, one or the other
[3:13:38.000 --> 3:13:42.000]  After everybody dies, they've got 85% of their population
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:44.000]  Let's say that's immune
[3:13:44.000 --> 3:13:49.000]  Now China can launch this as a weapon against any nation
[3:13:49.000 --> 3:13:52.000]  They could even launch invasions of nations
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:55.000]  Because their troops will now be immune to the virus
[3:13:55.000 --> 3:13:59.000]  So by paying the price of allowing this to spread across China
[3:13:59.000 --> 3:14:01.000]  Which is exactly what they're doing
[3:14:01.000 --> 3:14:06.000]  They are creating a nation, the world's first nation of immune citizens
[3:14:06.000 --> 3:14:09.000]  And trust me, China will weaponize this
[3:14:09.000 --> 3:14:12.000]  They will deploy this against the United States
[3:14:12.000 --> 3:14:16.000]  And there is nothing that the U.S. can do to stop this virus
[3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:23.000]  If it is weaponized and deliberately released across 100 U.S. cities simultaneously
[3:14:23.000 --> 3:14:26.000]  Even the CDC would tell you, they would admit
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:28.000]  There's nothing that they can do to stop that
[3:14:28.000 --> 3:14:32.000]  The CDC's ability to stop this depends on compliance
[3:14:32.000 --> 3:14:36.000]  From people who don't want the virus to spread
[3:14:36.000 --> 3:14:40.000]  If you have people that come in and deliberately want it to spread
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:42.000]  There is no containment that's possible
[3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:45.000]  There is nothing the CDC can do to stop that
[3:14:45.000 --> 3:14:47.000]  And they would admit that
[3:14:47.000 --> 3:14:50.000]  And believe me, at the highest levels of government right now
[3:14:50.000 --> 3:14:52.000]  Inside the Pentagon, inside the State Department
[3:14:52.000 --> 3:14:54.000]  Inside the National Security Council
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:14:59.000]  We know somebody is going to harvest this biological weapon system
[3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:01.000]  This coronavirus that was engineered
[3:15:01.000 --> 3:15:06.000]  And they are going to release it in the United States as soon as possible
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:09.000]  Are you ready for that scenario?
[3:15:09.000 --> 3:15:12.000]  Are you ready for a malicious assault against our country?
[3:15:12.000 --> 3:15:16.000]  Using this virus that frankly some people in China
[3:15:16.000 --> 3:15:20.000]  They believe falsely, but they believe that the U.S. dropped this on China
[3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:22.000]  They think it's a bioweapon from the U.S.
[3:15:22.000 --> 3:15:25.000]  So of course, they want revenge in their minds
[3:15:25.000 --> 3:15:27.000]  They're going to deploy this against the United States
[3:15:27.000 --> 3:15:29.000]  We'll talk about that scenario
[3:15:29.000 --> 3:15:33.000]  And some very practical things that you can do to protect yourself
[3:15:33.000 --> 3:15:37.000]  Against this infection when we return after this short break
[3:15:37.000 --> 3:15:41.000]  This is Mike Adams, you're watching Infowars, the Alex Jones show
[3:15:41.000 --> 3:15:44.000]  Stay with us, we'll be back with more good information
[3:15:44.000 --> 3:15:46.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla
[3:15:46.000 --> 3:15:48.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[3:15:48.000 --> 3:15:50.000]  When they tried to seize my mother's house
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:51.000]  I sued the IRS in one
[3:15:51.000 --> 3:15:54.000]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since
[3:15:54.000 --> 3:15:56.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[3:15:56.000 --> 3:15:58.000]  And I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[3:15:58.000 --> 3:16:00.000]  They thought might never be solved
[3:16:00.000 --> 3:16:01.000]  I can help you, too
[3:16:01.000 --> 3:16:04.000]  If you owe taxes, you can't pay, don't wait another day
[3:16:04.000 --> 3:16:06.000]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case

[3:18:16.120 --> 3:18:19.080]  You can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus.
[3:18:19.080 --> 3:18:22.120]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months.
[3:18:22.120 --> 3:18:23.120]  It's incredible.
[3:18:23.120 --> 3:18:24.760]  So do yourself a favor.
[3:18:24.760 --> 3:18:27.160]  Try out the products if you've been on the fence.

[3:18:36.440 --> 3:18:37.440]  our action.
[3:18:37.440 --> 3:18:39.000]  But you need these products.

[3:18:41.920 --> 3:18:46.040]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth.
[3:18:46.040 --> 3:18:49.760]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO instead of imploding.
[3:18:49.760 --> 3:18:51.560]  We're fighting to win and we are winning.
[3:18:51.560 --> 3:18:52.560]  Thanks to you.
[3:18:52.560 --> 3:18:57.040]  This should really be easier than it is.
[3:18:57.040 --> 3:18:59.160]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[3:18:59.160 --> 3:19:01.880]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[3:19:01.880 --> 3:19:07.320]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work that if you listen to me and try
[3:19:07.320 --> 3:19:13.520]  them out for yourself, you will see how amazing it is and then your support of the product
[3:19:13.520 --> 3:19:18.440]  we're selling will help you and will help us and it's symbiotic.
[3:19:18.440 --> 3:19:23.880]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's
[3:19:23.880 --> 3:19:25.200]  the bad halogen.
[3:19:25.200 --> 3:19:30.080]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally
[3:19:30.080 --> 3:19:37.300]  I listened to Dr. Grip like eight years ago is sort of taking true iodine, atomic iodine.
[3:19:37.300 --> 3:19:43.120]  We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now at infowarstore.com and I'm telling you

[3:19:49.720 --> 3:19:55.120]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[3:19:55.120 --> 3:20:08.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:08.000 --> 3:20:14.040]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Mike Adams.
[3:20:14.040 --> 3:20:19.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:19.200 --> 3:20:22.880]  One of the interesting things that Francis Boyle mentioned in the interview that you
[3:20:22.880 --> 3:20:29.320]  saw earlier on this show today is that in his view, this coronavirus pandemic will probably
[3:20:29.320 --> 3:20:34.020]  be worse than the Spanish flu of 1918.
[3:20:34.020 --> 3:20:38.800]  Now if you go back and look at the numbers there, that flu infected about 500 million
[3:20:38.800 --> 3:20:44.120]  people, half a billion people, which was roughly about a third of the global population at
[3:20:44.120 --> 3:20:45.680]  the time.
[3:20:45.680 --> 3:20:51.920]  It had a kill rate or what's called a mortality rate of about 10% killing an estimated 50
[3:20:51.920 --> 3:20:53.160]  billion people.
[3:20:53.160 --> 3:20:55.160]  That was 1918.
[3:20:55.160 --> 3:20:58.920]  Francis Boyle says this is probably going to be worse and I think that he may be correct
[3:20:58.920 --> 3:21:00.040]  about that.
[3:21:00.040 --> 3:21:04.600]  This is certainly lining up to be much worse because of course now we have a global population
[3:21:04.600 --> 3:21:10.680]  of let's just say roughly, let's just rough out the edges of it to 7.5 billion people.
[3:21:10.680 --> 3:21:17.160]  So one third of 7.5 billion people is 2.5 billion people could get infected with this.
[3:21:17.160 --> 3:21:22.040]  Actually the real number may be much higher according to, for example, Dr. Leong out of
[3:21:22.040 --> 3:21:29.000]  Hong Kong could be 60% of the world population, even up to 80% of the world population infected.
[3:21:29.000 --> 3:21:32.960]  But let's just go with one third, all right, just to be conservative about this.
[3:21:32.960 --> 3:21:35.840]  So let's say 2.5 billion people get infected.
[3:21:35.840 --> 3:21:41.200]  Well out of 2.5 billion people, if you have a mortality rate of 10%, well then that's
[3:21:41.200 --> 3:21:47.200]  250 million deaths all around the world.
[3:21:47.200 --> 3:21:53.760]  I mean think about a quarter of a billion people, 250 million deaths.
[3:21:53.760 --> 3:22:00.200]  That's a lot of dead souls and yet we're told that this has all been conquered.
[3:22:00.200 --> 3:22:03.160]  It's all now totally under control.
[3:22:03.160 --> 3:22:08.840]  China is fudging the numbers daily now to show a trend, a downward trend even as the
[3:22:08.840 --> 3:22:13.920]  truth about their infections is that it hasn't even peaked in China and the infections have
[3:22:13.920 --> 3:22:16.440]  only begun outside of China.
[3:22:16.440 --> 3:22:17.640]  It's really incredible.
[3:22:17.640 --> 3:22:23.480]  But people say well none of that will happen now because this isn't 1918 and we have better
[3:22:23.480 --> 3:22:25.800]  testing technology today.
[3:22:25.800 --> 3:22:27.560]  We have better medicine.
[3:22:27.560 --> 3:22:28.840]  We have better vaccines.
[3:22:28.840 --> 3:22:30.440]  We have better hospitals.
[3:22:30.440 --> 3:22:38.280]  Okay, so this morning Dr. Messonnier from the CDC just alerted journalists all across
[3:22:38.280 --> 3:22:44.040]  the world that the CDC has been shipping out test kits to all 50 states, hundreds of thousands
[3:22:44.040 --> 3:22:45.440]  of test kits.
[3:22:45.440 --> 3:22:50.440]  She admitted this morning and by the way I have to say she's been one of the more honest
[3:22:50.440 --> 3:22:52.200]  and transparent scientists.
[3:22:52.200 --> 3:22:55.920]  She admitted those test kits don't work in many cases.
[3:22:55.920 --> 3:23:01.400]  They produce false positives and false negatives because the reagents are bad.
[3:23:01.400 --> 3:23:05.520]  The reagents are normally the little powdered chemicals that you add to the test kits and
[3:23:05.520 --> 3:23:09.800]  some local doctors or clinicians are unable to follow the directions.
[3:23:09.800 --> 3:23:10.800]  Imagine that.
[3:23:10.800 --> 3:23:13.880]  We live in a nation now where people can't follow directions.
[3:23:13.880 --> 3:23:20.000]  So if the test kit says, you know, swab the patient's throat, put the swab in this vial,
[3:23:20.000 --> 3:23:24.720]  add, I'm just guessing because I'm a lab scientist, I've run these kinds of tests before.
[3:23:24.720 --> 3:23:30.600]  Let's say add 5 milliliters of water and 5 milliliters of methanol or whatever, alcohol,
[3:23:30.600 --> 3:23:35.640]  isopropyl alcohol, whatever the solvent might happen to be, shake it up for 30 seconds,
[3:23:35.640 --> 3:23:41.520]  transfer it with a pipette to another vial, add 1.2 grams of this reagent, vortex it for
[3:23:41.520 --> 3:23:46.760]  30 seconds, incubate it at whatever temperature for how many minutes, and then compare it
[3:23:46.760 --> 3:23:49.440]  to this color chart, that's your answer, okay?
[3:23:49.440 --> 3:23:55.120]  Those steps, which are very common in these kinds of lab tests, those steps are unable
[3:23:55.120 --> 3:23:59.560]  to be followed by most people working in clinics today, believe it or not.
[3:23:59.560 --> 3:24:04.840]  Again, we live in a country where the average young person can't change a tire.
[3:24:04.840 --> 3:24:08.600]  And we also live in a country where people can't follow directions who work in hospitals
[3:24:08.600 --> 3:24:09.600]  and clinics.
[3:24:09.600 --> 3:24:12.400]  And so you get what's called false positives and false negatives.
[3:24:12.400 --> 3:24:16.840]  A false positive says that you have the virus when you don't.
[3:24:16.840 --> 3:24:21.600]  So you get dragged off into a quarantine center and stuffed in essentially a jail cell with
[3:24:21.600 --> 3:24:26.280]  a bunch of other people who really are infected, even though you're not, and guess what happens
[3:24:26.280 --> 3:24:30.080]  after 24 hours, oh, now you're really infected.
[3:24:30.080 --> 3:24:32.800]  So then they say, well, the test must have been accurate.
[3:24:32.800 --> 3:24:33.800]  See, you're infected.
[3:24:33.800 --> 3:24:38.720]  Now, no, you morons, you threw me in a quarantine camp with a bunch of truly infected people.
[3:24:38.720 --> 3:24:40.680]  So that's a false positive.
[3:24:40.680 --> 3:24:44.520]  A false negative is even more dangerous for society as a whole.
[3:24:44.520 --> 3:24:49.780]  A false negative is that they say you don't have the virus when you do.
[3:24:49.780 --> 3:24:54.720]  So the CDC test kit, use in a local clinic or a hospital, sends you home.
[3:24:54.720 --> 3:24:59.560]  They say, oh, don't worry, all that coughing and fever and diarrhea that you have.
[3:24:59.560 --> 3:25:00.560]  Don't worry.
[3:25:00.560 --> 3:25:01.560]  It's not the coronavirus.
[3:25:01.560 --> 3:25:03.400]  Our test kit just proved it.
[3:25:03.400 --> 3:25:08.840]  You can go home, go to that party, go to that reunion, go to movie theaters, whatever, go
[3:25:08.840 --> 3:25:13.000]  back to work, shake hands with people on a professional basis.
[3:25:13.000 --> 3:25:14.000]  You're fine.
[3:25:14.000 --> 3:25:16.360]  Turns out that person has the virus.
[3:25:16.360 --> 3:25:18.560]  And then, of course, they're spreading it everywhere.
[3:25:18.560 --> 3:25:22.900]  But if they're asked by any official, they will say, no, I tested negative because the
[3:25:22.900 --> 3:25:24.760]  test kits are bad.
[3:25:24.760 --> 3:25:27.600]  Now why are the test kits bad?
[3:25:27.600 --> 3:25:31.880]  And by the way, this means all this advanced technology, all this advanced science and
[3:25:31.880 --> 3:25:36.800]  medicine and everything, it's pointless if the test kits don't work, right?
[3:25:36.800 --> 3:25:38.320]  It's pointless.
[3:25:38.320 --> 3:25:43.240]  Because it used to be you would send a sample to the CDC lab in Atlanta, and they would
[3:25:43.240 --> 3:25:46.960]  have like a three-day turnaround, and they would get backlogged.
[3:25:46.960 --> 3:25:51.440]  So it ended up being like two to three weeks turnaround in some cases, except for high-priority
[3:25:51.440 --> 3:25:53.120]  samples.
[3:25:53.120 --> 3:25:58.240]  And they would use like a DNA analysis, PCR, replication, gene sequencer type of instrument.
[3:25:58.240 --> 3:26:02.080]  And it takes about three days, roughly, maybe two to three days to get results on that.
[3:26:02.080 --> 3:26:04.200]  But the results were accurate.
[3:26:04.200 --> 3:26:09.040]  So in two to three days, you could get almost 100% accurate results.
[3:26:09.040 --> 3:26:17.240]  But now they have test kits in four to five hours, you can get a 50% false negative rate.
[3:26:17.240 --> 3:26:18.680]  This is called progress.
[3:26:18.680 --> 3:26:25.080]  So I guess, according to this, I should start a new company that sells kits that have a
[3:26:25.080 --> 3:26:29.280]  99% failure rate, but deliver results in two minutes.
[3:26:29.280 --> 3:26:33.360]  And that would be a trillion-dollar IPO, because no doubt China would buy those test kits.
[3:26:33.360 --> 3:26:34.840]  They would say, this is awesome.
[3:26:34.840 --> 3:26:37.280]  Our infection numbers are falling everywhere.
[3:26:37.280 --> 3:26:38.280]  This is awesome.
[3:26:38.280 --> 3:26:39.280]  Look at that.
[3:26:39.280 --> 3:26:40.520]  We've got this thing licked.
[3:26:40.520 --> 3:26:46.120]  And speaking of China, by the way, so China pushed their biotech companies to rush these
[3:26:46.120 --> 3:26:47.120]  test kits out.
[3:26:47.120 --> 3:26:53.680]  Now, normally, these test kits require two to three years to develop and test and validate
[3:26:53.680 --> 3:26:58.000]  using clinical trials, two to three years.
[3:26:58.000 --> 3:27:01.340]  China decided, well, we need these in two to three weeks.
[3:27:01.340 --> 3:27:06.640]  So they pushed their biotech companies to produce these test kits in two to three weeks,
[3:27:06.640 --> 3:27:08.240]  and they sent them out all over China.
[3:27:08.240 --> 3:27:09.240]  And guess what?
[3:27:09.240 --> 3:27:14.840]  50% to 70% false negative rate, because they weren't tested.
[3:27:14.840 --> 3:27:16.480]  They weren't validated.
[3:27:16.480 --> 3:27:18.120]  They are a joke.
[3:27:18.120 --> 3:27:21.160]  But it allows China to be able to say, well, guess what?
[3:27:21.160 --> 3:27:22.840]  The infections are falling.
[3:27:22.840 --> 3:27:23.840]  Look at that.
[3:27:23.840 --> 3:27:24.840]  The infections are falling.
[3:27:24.840 --> 3:27:27.680]  The test kits are showing us that there are hardly any infections anymore.
[3:27:27.680 --> 3:27:31.120]  And that's what you're seeing in the numbers released by China as they have shifted from
[3:27:31.120 --> 3:27:34.820]  the gene sequencing instruments to these failed test kits.
[3:27:34.820 --> 3:27:37.320]  So that's why the numbers are falling in China.
[3:27:37.320 --> 3:27:38.320]  Get it?
[3:27:38.320 --> 3:27:39.640]  It's on purpose.
[3:27:39.640 --> 3:27:44.880]  China probably ordered those biotech companies to produce tests that would result in false
[3:27:44.880 --> 3:27:47.560]  negatives, because that's the goal they want.
[3:27:47.560 --> 3:27:50.040]  They want to be able to say, this thing is solved.
[3:27:50.040 --> 3:27:58.000]  So now China is reopening factories, and soon they're going to just force people to go
[3:27:58.000 --> 3:28:01.880]  back to work at gunpoint and say, we've got to keep the factories running, because if
[3:28:01.880 --> 3:28:03.880]  we don't, we're going to lose our economy.
[3:28:03.880 --> 3:28:08.280]  They know that this thing is still spreading, and it's going to spread at the factories.
[3:28:08.280 --> 3:28:11.360]  But they're going to have gunpoint soldiers in there.
[3:28:11.360 --> 3:28:12.360]  Get to work.
[3:28:12.360 --> 3:28:17.840]  A gun at your head, work until you literally drop dead, because they have to keep the factories
[3:28:17.840 --> 3:28:18.840]  running.
[3:28:18.840 --> 3:28:25.680]  They know China has already realized they're going to lose 5% to 10% to 15% of their population.
[3:28:25.680 --> 3:28:27.800]  This is so far beyond containment.
[3:28:27.800 --> 3:28:30.760]  They're going to lose millions of lives, but they're going to keep the factories running
[3:28:30.760 --> 3:28:36.120]  at all costs, even if they have to drag dead bodies off the assembly lines to keep those
[3:28:36.120 --> 3:28:37.240]  factories running.
[3:28:37.240 --> 3:28:38.520]  They've made that decision.
[3:28:38.520 --> 3:28:41.720]  That's what they're going to do, which means this will never be contained.
[3:28:41.720 --> 3:28:43.960]  This is going global.
[3:28:43.960 --> 3:28:44.960]  More straight ahead.

[3:29:58.920 --> 3:30:02.440]  The globalists are trying to plunge the economy, they're trying to start wars, they're trying
[3:30:02.440 --> 3:30:05.800]  to overthrow the president, they're trying to silence free speech, they're trying to
[3:30:05.800 --> 3:30:10.020]  trigger riots in the streets but everything they do is blowing up in their face.
[3:30:10.020 --> 3:30:14.360]  We the people have to pray, stay focused, be involved, keep spreading the word, keep

[3:33:40.000 --> 3:33:44.080]  Thank you for joining me, Mike Adams here from Natural News on the Alex Jones show with
[3:33:44.080 --> 3:33:46.280]  Solutions for Coronavirus.
[3:33:46.280 --> 3:33:51.240]  Now I've been doing a lot of research the last few days on certain molecules, because
[3:33:51.240 --> 3:33:55.600]  I study molecules all the time in the lab, I run multiple mass spec instruments, we do
[3:33:55.600 --> 3:34:01.600]  time of flight mass spec, triple quad mass spec, we do pesticide analysis, CBD analysis
[3:34:01.600 --> 3:34:04.320]  for quantitation of cannabinoids, and things like that.
[3:34:04.320 --> 3:34:10.040]  So I'm very familiar with this area of research, and I was looking at what are the most likely
[3:34:10.040 --> 3:34:18.920]  natural molecules that can inhibit the enzymatic processes required for the coronavirus to
[3:34:18.920 --> 3:34:27.640]  replicate, one target for that is called 3Cl or 3C-like protease, which is an enzyme that's
[3:34:27.640 --> 3:34:30.560]  necessary when the virus takes over your body's cells.
[3:34:30.560 --> 3:34:36.640]  It needs that enzyme function in order to continue to replicate and swarm your body
[3:34:36.640 --> 3:34:39.360]  with more viruses.
[3:34:39.360 --> 3:34:45.040]  Now the good news is that there's a ton of research on this because of SARS.
[3:34:45.040 --> 3:34:51.920]  So back in 2003, when SARS first had its outbreak, remember SARS is a coronavirus, and it shares
[3:34:51.920 --> 3:34:58.680]  about 80% of the genetic code, which means the protein structure with the current Wuhan
[3:34:58.680 --> 3:35:02.800]  coronavirus, NCOV coronavirus or whatever new name they have now, they keep changing
[3:35:02.800 --> 3:35:07.840]  the name every day to try to distance it from China, by the way, so they keep coming up
[3:35:07.840 --> 3:35:08.840]  with new names.
[3:35:08.840 --> 3:35:13.220]  But if you go back and look at the research on SARS, it's quite fascinating.
[3:35:13.220 --> 3:35:19.120]  Under the SARS outbreak at that time, China itself funded a tremendous amount of research
[3:35:19.120 --> 3:35:25.200]  into natural herbs and foods, substances, various molecules, various bioflavonoids,
[3:35:25.200 --> 3:35:30.720]  for example, typically from fruits, Chinese medicine substances, also prescription drugs
[3:35:30.720 --> 3:35:31.720]  as well.
[3:35:31.720 --> 3:35:36.640]  They tested every chemical they could think of against SARS, and they found quite a few
[3:35:36.640 --> 3:35:45.120]  molecules that would have a very strong inhibitory effect against the 3Cl protease process in
[3:35:45.120 --> 3:35:46.520]  the body.
[3:35:46.520 --> 3:35:48.480]  And right now, I'm documenting those.
[3:35:48.480 --> 3:35:52.640]  I'm going to share a few with you here today, but I'm doing more research and more documentation
[3:35:52.640 --> 3:35:58.160]  so that I can present this publicly with good research behind it, lots of papers out there
[3:35:58.160 --> 3:36:00.200]  on this right now.
[3:36:00.200 --> 3:36:06.960]  So the good news is you don't have to be killed by this, and there is good, steady research
[3:36:06.960 --> 3:36:09.680]  right now about what can work.
[3:36:09.680 --> 3:36:11.280]  And so let me give an example.
[3:36:11.280 --> 3:36:14.880]  One of the interesting things here is I found a theoretical research paper that was doing
[3:36:14.880 --> 3:36:16.360]  protein modeling.
[3:36:16.360 --> 3:36:23.640]  This is a theoretical paper, not a clinical trial, but it found that one of the food chemicals
[3:36:23.640 --> 3:36:33.440]  that can function theoretically to help stop this virus is called herbacetin, H-E-R-B-A-C-E-T-I-N.
[3:36:33.440 --> 3:36:37.160]  Turns out it's a phytochemical found in flaxseed.
[3:36:37.160 --> 3:36:43.120]  So you can eat flaxseed right now, and you can get herbacetin in your body at some level.
[3:36:43.120 --> 3:36:49.760]  Now, I haven't tested flaxseed for what concentration of herbacetin is found in flaxseed.
[3:36:49.760 --> 3:36:54.040]  It might be that you have to eat pounds of flaxseed to get a therapeutic dose of this.
[3:36:54.040 --> 3:36:58.920]  I don't know the answer to that yet, but the truth is it can't hurt to eat flaxseed.
[3:36:58.920 --> 3:36:59.920]  That's the thing.
[3:36:59.920 --> 3:37:04.880]  There's no risk, there's no downside to eating healthier, and you're going to get some nutrients
[3:37:04.880 --> 3:37:07.720]  that may actually work to block this virus.
[3:37:07.720 --> 3:37:10.520]  So that's one of them, herbacetin, in flaxseed.
[3:37:10.520 --> 3:37:15.200]  And by the way, flaxseed is rich with omega-3s, and it protects your heart.
[3:37:15.200 --> 3:37:17.520]  It helps prevent type 2 diabetes.
[3:37:17.520 --> 3:37:21.120]  I mean, it stabilizes blood sugar.
[3:37:21.120 --> 3:37:22.120]  Flaxseed is amazing.
[3:37:22.120 --> 3:37:24.920]  I put some in my smoothie every day, and I've been doing it for years.
[3:37:24.920 --> 3:37:30.200]  I'm drinking ground-up flaxseed every day, and not just flax oil, by the way.
[3:37:30.200 --> 3:37:33.840]  Flax lignans, flax fiber is very good for you.
[3:37:33.840 --> 3:37:37.600]  So part of this is eat more flax, okay?
[3:37:37.600 --> 3:37:41.640]  Now, then some critic would say, well, you're telling people to eat flaxseed and not take
[3:37:41.640 --> 3:37:43.640]  the vaccine.
[3:37:43.640 --> 3:37:45.840]  You moron, there is no vaccine.
[3:37:45.840 --> 3:37:50.280]  But you can get flaxseed at the grocery store right now, so do what you can now.
[3:37:50.280 --> 3:37:53.680]  It doesn't mean that you can't consider other options later on.
[3:37:53.680 --> 3:37:55.320]  You can consider prescription drugs.
[3:37:55.320 --> 3:37:58.000]  You can consider a vaccine if you want to take that risk.
[3:37:58.000 --> 3:37:59.360]  You can consider all those things.
[3:37:59.360 --> 3:38:01.360]  But you can eat flax, too.
[3:38:01.360 --> 3:38:03.600]  It's called complementary medicine.
[3:38:03.600 --> 3:38:07.680]  You can have food and nutrients that work for this.
[3:38:07.680 --> 3:38:10.440]  And by the way, speaking of food, there's another bioflavonoid that we found in the
[3:38:10.440 --> 3:38:14.920]  research that is found in orange peels.
[3:38:14.920 --> 3:38:17.400]  And I actually did an article on this.
[3:38:17.400 --> 3:38:23.160]  It's mentioned in a patent of an antiviral sanitizing spray that you can spray on the
[3:38:23.160 --> 3:38:27.840]  surface and it kills coronavirus.
[3:38:27.840 --> 3:38:30.720]  So this is known to kill viruses on surfaces.
[3:38:30.720 --> 3:38:39.440]  And it's a patented formulation based on bioflavonoids, mostly from citrus peels.
[3:38:39.440 --> 3:38:41.040]  So when I found that, you know what I did?
[3:38:41.040 --> 3:38:47.360]  I went out and I ordered certified organic orange peel granules.
[3:38:47.360 --> 3:38:50.520]  And as soon as I get those, I'm going to be mixing those into my smoothies, because you
[3:38:50.520 --> 3:38:53.280]  know how you can have orange zest as a spice?
[3:38:53.280 --> 3:38:57.680]  You know, a lot of meals, you know, I don't know, high-end chefs or something, high-end
[3:38:57.680 --> 3:39:00.760]  restaurants, they'll have some orange zest on your food.
[3:39:00.760 --> 3:39:04.680]  Well, it turns out that orange peel, although not typically considered a food, you wouldn't
[3:39:04.680 --> 3:39:09.200]  want to make a meal out of it, but you could buy candied orange peels, for example.
[3:39:09.200 --> 3:39:14.480]  You can use orange zest as a spice, and it's full of nutrients.
[3:39:14.480 --> 3:39:18.000]  And some of these nutrients have an antiviral effect.
[3:39:18.000 --> 3:39:19.800]  Isn't that amazing?
[3:39:19.800 --> 3:39:21.200]  So that's just another example.
[3:39:21.200 --> 3:39:24.440]  Again, I have a lot more research on this.
[3:39:24.440 --> 3:39:25.440]  Here's something else.
[3:39:25.440 --> 3:39:30.200]  We found that there is a tree, I'm not going to name it yet, but there's a tree that grows
[3:39:30.200 --> 3:39:32.680]  in Korea, Taiwan, and Japan.
[3:39:32.680 --> 3:39:39.280]  The bark of this tree naturally synthesizes a molecule that kills coronavirus.
[3:39:39.280 --> 3:39:41.280]  And this wood has a very special smell.
[3:39:41.280 --> 3:39:44.800]  I've actually got samples of it right next door here.
[3:39:44.800 --> 3:39:45.800]  It has a very special smell.
[3:39:45.800 --> 3:39:48.840]  It's used in exotic wood carving and wood furniture.
[3:39:48.840 --> 3:39:53.520]  When I visited temples in Taiwan when I lived there, I remember this smell, because that
[3:39:53.520 --> 3:39:58.360]  was the furniture that was carved out of this very, very special exotic wood.
[3:39:58.360 --> 3:40:01.400]  And it's used in Korea, in Japan, in Taiwan, and even China.
[3:40:01.400 --> 3:40:04.640]  This wood contains a chemical that kills coronavirus.
[3:40:04.640 --> 3:40:10.160]  So isn't it interesting that the people in the countries that are being hit by this virus,
[3:40:10.160 --> 3:40:16.640]  they are living among trees that are already growing the cure for free, naturally.
[3:40:16.640 --> 3:40:21.080]  And yet they're waiting for a vaccine, and many of them will die waiting for a vaccine
[3:40:21.080 --> 3:40:25.120]  or waiting for a drug because they don't recognize the medicine that's already there
[3:40:25.120 --> 3:40:28.560]  all around them, indigenous to the area.
[3:40:28.560 --> 3:40:31.040]  Mother nature has already put the cures there.
[3:40:31.040 --> 3:40:33.080]  We just have to be wise enough to recognize them.
[3:40:33.080 --> 3:40:36.400]  Now, some practical things about food.
[3:40:36.400 --> 3:40:42.480]  Many of the molecules that we're finding are found to be highly present or high concentrations
[3:40:42.480 --> 3:40:49.560]  in exotic Indian cuisine, Pakistani cuisine, Middle Eastern foods.
[3:40:49.560 --> 3:40:51.720]  So I've got a homework assignment for you.
[3:40:51.720 --> 3:40:58.840]  I want you, you patriotic Americans out there, people who love America, I want you to eat
[3:40:58.840 --> 3:41:00.640]  Middle Eastern food for a while.
[3:41:00.640 --> 3:41:01.920]  I want you to eat Indian cuisine.
[3:41:01.920 --> 3:41:06.920]  I want you to go to a Pakistani grocery store, which has an amazingly potent smell because
[3:41:06.920 --> 3:41:08.640]  those are the herbs in the jars.
[3:41:08.640 --> 3:41:13.040]  I want you to buy the mixes, buy the herbs, buy the curries.
[3:41:13.040 --> 3:41:20.000]  I want you to go load up on all these exotic food, recipes, and mixes from the Middle East.
[3:41:20.000 --> 3:41:23.360]  Again, maybe you can find Afghanistan food.
[3:41:23.360 --> 3:41:30.200]  I'm not sure, but this food contains natural antiviral molecules.
[3:41:30.200 --> 3:41:36.760]  You should be eating this food because if you live on pancakes and corn syrup and frosted
[3:41:36.760 --> 3:41:38.440]  flakes, that's not going to help you.
[3:41:38.440 --> 3:41:41.840]  That's just garbage, processed food, and carbohydrates.
[3:41:41.840 --> 3:41:46.120]  The medicine is in the potent, pungent spices.
[3:41:46.120 --> 3:41:49.640]  And in fact, it's amazing.
[3:41:49.640 --> 3:41:51.120]  I found a spice.
[3:41:51.120 --> 3:41:57.440]  I bought a sample, a spice that is so potent that contains a molecule that combats coronavirus.
[3:41:57.440 --> 3:42:01.960]  I'm not prepared to name this particular spice yet, but I'll give you a hint.
[3:42:01.960 --> 3:42:07.640]  It's used as a flavoring agent in exotic Russian gin.
[3:42:07.640 --> 3:42:12.200]  Because the taste is amazing, it's like an explosion of all kinds of phytochemicals and
[3:42:12.200 --> 3:42:17.400]  phytonutrients in your mouth, and it contains antiviral nutrients in this spice.
[3:42:17.400 --> 3:42:22.680]  It's known as a spice, and it's used in certain exotic recipes throughout the Middle East.
[3:42:22.680 --> 3:42:27.720]  So literally, while you're waiting for big pharma to fumble around with failed tests
[3:42:27.720 --> 3:42:33.600]  and toxic vaccines, you can be eating your way to a defensive posture to defend yourself
[3:42:33.600 --> 3:42:35.320]  against this virus.
[3:42:35.320 --> 3:42:36.480]  Change what you eat.
[3:42:36.480 --> 3:42:43.680]  Go for the spices, the pungent mixes, the orange zest, the herbs that work, the superfoods.
[3:42:43.680 --> 3:42:45.680]  This can literally help save your life.
[3:42:45.680 --> 3:42:47.840]  I'll be back after this break with more.
[3:42:47.840 --> 3:42:51.320]  Stay with us.
[3:42:51.320 --> 3:42:56.840]  I have confirmed with high-level sources that President Trump is intending to either pardon
[3:42:56.840 --> 3:43:02.400]  Roger Stone after his sentencing, or give him clemency, saying the conviction stands,
[3:43:02.400 --> 3:43:05.040]  but you now basically don't go to jail.
[3:43:05.040 --> 3:43:10.320]  Either way, this is incredibly good news, but let's not forget Julian Assange.
[3:43:10.320 --> 3:43:14.400]  That's one of the biggest black marks on Trump is that he famously said, I don't know who
[3:43:14.400 --> 3:43:15.400]  got the emails.
[3:43:15.400 --> 3:43:16.920]  I don't know where they came from.
[3:43:16.920 --> 3:43:20.840]  The Russians, a fat dude in his mom's basement, whoever's got them, release them.
[3:43:20.840 --> 3:43:25.280]  It's about Hillary committing a crime, not who has the emails, don't change the subject.
[3:43:25.280 --> 3:43:28.480]  Well, Julian Assange undoubtedly took Trump over the top.
[3:43:28.480 --> 3:43:30.160]  The WikiLeaks exposed the deep state.
[3:43:30.160 --> 3:43:31.320]  The man is a hero.
[3:43:31.320 --> 3:43:32.920]  Daniel Ellsberg was a hero.
[3:43:32.920 --> 3:43:36.920]  Well, Assange is even a bigger hero, and he's rotting in solitary confinement, and
[3:43:36.920 --> 3:43:39.160]  the court hearings can barely talk.
[3:43:39.160 --> 3:43:43.560]  President Trump do the right thing and asked the British to release Julian Assange and
[3:43:43.560 --> 3:43:44.560]  give him a medal.
[3:43:44.560 --> 3:43:54.000]  President Trump, you must release Julian Assange, free Julian Assange, free Julian Assange.
[3:43:54.000 --> 3:44:00.560]  Cobra commander here reminding you to not own firearms, to not take supplements, to not
[3:44:00.560 --> 3:44:04.520]  get sunshine, and to not love Jesus.
[3:44:04.520 --> 3:44:10.160]  And of course, do not get storable foods or any other types of colloidal nano silver at
[3:44:10.160 --> 3:44:12.920]  infowarstore.com.
[3:44:12.920 --> 3:44:15.160]  Do not do it.
[3:44:15.160 --> 3:44:24.000]  Trust CNN, trust MSNBC, drink fluoridated water, just like the loving kiss of a King Cobra,
[3:44:24.000 --> 3:44:29.360]  pumping deadly, I mean loving, helpful nutrients in your body.
[3:44:29.360 --> 3:44:42.240]  Hug the cobra, love the cobra, kiss the cobra, but never, never go to infowar.com or infowarstore.com.
[3:44:42.240 --> 3:44:50.240]  Do not order those products, silence, don't show it.
[3:44:50.240 --> 3:44:52.960]  Ah, s**t.
[3:44:52.960 --> 3:44:53.960]  Don't be a victim.
[3:44:53.960 --> 3:44:57.800]  If you're worried about the coronavirus, exercise, but not too hard, because that can
[3:44:57.800 --> 3:44:58.800]  lower your immune system.
[3:44:58.800 --> 3:45:02.360]  Drink extra purified clean water so that no toxins weigh you down, you have plenty of
[3:45:02.360 --> 3:45:05.560]  hydration, prayer, and meditation has been proven to make you healthier.
[3:45:05.560 --> 3:45:09.480]  Get plenty of vitamin C, get plenty of vitamin D3, which is fish oil, take your colloidal
[3:45:09.480 --> 3:45:14.240]  silver, all of it, that's what allows you to be healthier and get plenty of sleep.
[3:45:14.240 --> 3:45:19.480]  We have sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle that has the nano silver that Pat did in Documet
[3:45:19.480 --> 3:45:23.440]  and even admitted in Documents we've shown to go after this whole Corona SARS family.
[3:45:23.440 --> 3:45:27.240]  A virus, we're almost sold out of the one ounce spray bottles, that'll be sold out a
[3:45:27.240 --> 3:45:31.320]  couple days and we're about a week and a half or so of the super silver three ounce bottles.
[3:45:31.320 --> 3:45:34.200]  Great to have, period, really good for your gums, really great for your teeth.
[3:45:34.200 --> 3:45:38.080]  We also have the super silver in our whitening toothpaste, again, we're the only folks allowed
[3:45:38.080 --> 3:45:41.240]  to private label or make our own products with this top nano tech company based here
[3:45:41.240 --> 3:45:44.800]  in the US that's in all these Homeland Security Documents and everything, because we get the
[3:45:44.800 --> 3:45:46.720]  best stuff and there's a lot of patriots.
[3:45:46.720 --> 3:45:50.160]  There's not just bad guys coming after us, there's the flip side of all the good guys
[3:45:50.160 --> 3:45:54.680]  and good gals, it's very exciting.
[3:45:54.680 --> 3:45:58.960]  Three weeks ago we told you that the Pentagon had set up secret quarantine centers for the
[3:45:58.960 --> 3:46:03.040]  Coronavirus and that they believed it was much more serious than we were being told.
[3:46:03.040 --> 3:46:07.320]  Now we know that that is the case and we know the federal government and major corporations
[3:46:07.320 --> 3:46:11.840]  have been buying up all the major storable food supplies around the country, almost everyone
[3:46:11.840 --> 3:46:12.840]  else is sold out.
[3:46:12.840 --> 3:46:19.640]  But our supplier, my patriot, InfoWarStore.com still has their entire line of high quality
[3:46:19.640 --> 3:46:21.760]  fresh food and it's fresh.
[3:46:21.760 --> 3:46:24.480]  That's why you have to wait 10 to 14 days for it to get delivered.
[3:46:24.480 --> 3:46:27.100]  Not because they don't have the food, but because they've got to package it and their
[3:46:27.100 --> 3:46:30.120]  factories are going 24 hours a day.
[3:46:30.120 --> 3:46:34.240]  High quality fresh food, the best package systems, tastes great, protects you and your
[3:46:34.240 --> 3:46:39.040]  family and funds the InfoWar, you just got to get the orders in until they extend it
[3:46:39.040 --> 3:46:41.120]  out even more, which could happen.
[3:46:41.120 --> 3:46:45.760]  Lock in your orders now and sure you get it at InfoWarStore.com today.
[3:46:45.760 --> 3:46:55.600]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[3:46:55.600 --> 3:47:04.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:04.880 --> 3:47:09.440]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[3:47:09.440 --> 3:47:10.440]  You want answers?
[3:47:10.440 --> 3:47:12.800]  Well, so does he.
[3:47:12.800 --> 3:47:14.800]  It's Mike Adams.
[3:47:14.800 --> 3:47:22.000]  We're going to talk about the bioweapons aspect of this and to the producers, they pull up
[3:47:22.000 --> 3:47:29.720]  an article from the Epoch Times from J.R. Nyquist and the article is, I believe, entitled, Did
[3:47:29.720 --> 3:47:32.920]  China's Bioweapons Experiment Backfire?
[3:47:32.920 --> 3:47:38.600]  Because, you see, China has had a long-term plan to eliminate America using biological
[3:47:38.600 --> 3:47:44.000]  warfare weapons such as this and, in fact, that's the reason why China was building these
[3:47:44.000 --> 3:47:51.040]  biowearfare research centers that they claimed were all about public health.
[3:47:51.040 --> 3:47:55.520]  In truth, they're all about building biological weapons to ultimately destroy the United States.
[3:47:55.520 --> 3:48:00.800]  And J.R. Nyquist, who has a book, by the way, that I really want to read, I think you can
[3:48:00.800 --> 3:48:06.080]  get it on Amazon and other places, he talks about the history, I think in the 1990s, a
[3:48:06.080 --> 3:48:13.120]  top military official from China was explaining that China and the United States cannot both
[3:48:13.120 --> 3:48:18.640]  exist in the future of this world because the U.S. is opposing China's expansion.
[3:48:18.640 --> 3:48:23.680]  China wants to conquer Taiwan, for example, and expand to the Spratly Islands and even
[3:48:23.680 --> 3:48:25.720]  conquer really other nations, by the way.
[3:48:25.720 --> 3:48:30.600]  But China wants to conquer the moon, too, which is the high ground above planet Earth.
[3:48:30.600 --> 3:48:35.680]  China is being held in check by the United States, which is the world's strongest military
[3:48:35.680 --> 3:48:37.440]  force by far.
[3:48:37.440 --> 3:48:43.520]  And this is why China has built aircraft carrier factories where they can roll aircraft carriers
[3:48:43.520 --> 3:48:49.720]  off their factory line at some insane rate, like one every year or something, which would
[3:48:49.720 --> 3:48:54.560]  eventually dwarf the number of aircraft carriers that the United States Navy operates.
[3:48:54.560 --> 3:48:58.160]  I don't know what that number is, but it's not a huge number.
[3:48:58.160 --> 3:49:01.040]  All the aircraft carriers in the world is a very small number.
[3:49:01.040 --> 3:49:04.000]  It's not a common thing.
[3:49:04.000 --> 3:49:08.080]  So China has long-term plans to destroy the United States, and they thought they could
[3:49:08.080 --> 3:49:10.240]  do it with a biological weapon.
[3:49:10.240 --> 3:49:13.920]  That's why they were researching this, but then, of course, they accidentally released
[3:49:13.920 --> 3:49:19.200]  it because there's no quality control in China, and it infected them.
[3:49:19.200 --> 3:49:22.480]  However, it's not too late for them to still deploy this.
[3:49:22.480 --> 3:49:26.680]  In fact, according to my analysis, here's what's going to happen next.
[3:49:26.680 --> 3:49:33.960]  China will first seek to export this pandemic to other nations outside of China in order
[3:49:33.960 --> 3:49:38.640]  to divert blame for the global pandemic that's coming.
[3:49:38.640 --> 3:49:43.720]  So what China's going to do is fudge the numbers, show smaller and smaller numbers
[3:49:43.720 --> 3:49:49.040]  itself, and then issue press releases and declarations to say, oh, we've conquered it.
[3:49:49.040 --> 3:49:50.440]  But look at these other countries.
[3:49:50.440 --> 3:49:54.760]  Look at Singapore and Malaysia and Japan.
[3:49:54.760 --> 3:49:55.760]  They're the problem.
[3:49:55.760 --> 3:49:58.200]  They're the ones spreading it now, even though it's all a big lie.
[3:49:58.200 --> 3:50:01.800]  Actually, Taiwan is doing a great job controlling this.
[3:50:01.800 --> 3:50:03.520]  Japan is as well.
[3:50:03.520 --> 3:50:05.200]  Indonesia not so much.
[3:50:05.200 --> 3:50:09.880]  But Hong Kong's trying to protect themselves, but they've got the common border with China
[3:50:09.880 --> 3:50:13.160]  and a lot of communist China control there.
[3:50:13.160 --> 3:50:19.400]  But China is going to divert blame by spreading the virus deliberately to other countries
[3:50:19.400 --> 3:50:23.240]  so that those countries get blamed for the global wave.
[3:50:23.240 --> 3:50:28.720]  Once the global wave happens, China can then, and this is my analysis.
[3:50:28.720 --> 3:50:32.640]  This is what I think they will do because I know the pure evil that these communists
[3:50:32.640 --> 3:50:33.640]  are.
[3:50:33.640 --> 3:50:40.640]  China will have 100 volunteers, let's say, who don't yet have the virus or are willing
[3:50:40.640 --> 3:50:43.240]  to be re-injected with it or to spread it.
[3:50:43.240 --> 3:50:48.400]  They'll have 100 volunteers to go into the United States with the virus in their bodies
[3:50:48.400 --> 3:50:54.800]  or with maybe little nebulizer like nasal spray, you know, squeezable plastic bottles
[3:50:54.800 --> 3:50:56.720]  that are loaded with the virus, whatever.
[3:50:56.720 --> 3:51:02.400]  And they'll be sent to 100 cities across America with instructions to go touch everything
[3:51:02.400 --> 3:51:04.280]  that the public touches.
[3:51:04.280 --> 3:51:10.960]  Touch the handrails, touch the door handles, the elevator buttons, sneeze all over people's
[3:51:10.960 --> 3:51:12.280]  cell phones and whatever.
[3:51:12.280 --> 3:51:17.480]  The subway transportation systems, touch the doors and the, you know, the rails that you
[3:51:17.480 --> 3:51:22.120]  hold onto and the seats and the chairs and the movie theaters and touch all the food
[3:51:22.120 --> 3:51:26.880]  in the grocery stores and just spread the virus everywhere, all right?
[3:51:26.880 --> 3:51:29.880]  There is no way to stop them from doing that.
[3:51:29.880 --> 3:51:35.040]  There is no CDC program that can stop that if someone maliciously deliberately wants
[3:51:35.040 --> 3:51:37.320]  to spread it in America.
[3:51:37.320 --> 3:51:41.600]  Trump needs to know this information because this wave is coming and if it's not China,
[3:51:41.600 --> 3:51:44.680]  it's going to be North Korea or Iran or someone else.
[3:51:44.680 --> 3:51:51.320]  And then when America starts to suffer the economic problems that China is already suffering,
[3:51:51.320 --> 3:51:59.120]  China can blame America for China's own economic implosion that will threaten the very existence
[3:51:59.120 --> 3:52:04.440]  of its communist power structure because they will say, look, America is having problems.
[3:52:04.440 --> 3:52:08.600]  People aren't going out and shopping and they're not buying Chinese made products.
[3:52:08.600 --> 3:52:11.360]  That's why our economy is going down here in China.
[3:52:11.360 --> 3:52:15.880]  That's why we're not able to meet the goal of doubling our GDP in 10 years or whatever
[3:52:15.880 --> 3:52:18.360]  claim they were trying to make.
[3:52:18.360 --> 3:52:23.400]  So right now the goal is to divert blame and China doesn't care how many people they kill.
[3:52:23.400 --> 3:52:26.000]  In fact, they want to kill Americans.
[3:52:26.000 --> 3:52:32.240]  They've had a long-term plan to kill Americans and a long-term plan to invade Taiwan, conquer
[3:52:32.240 --> 3:52:33.800]  that independent nation.
[3:52:33.800 --> 3:52:38.440]  In fact, they've got the World Health Organization convinced that Taiwan is part of China.
[3:52:38.440 --> 3:52:39.440]  How insane is that?
[3:52:39.440 --> 3:52:43.440]  These countries that are banning flights to China, they're including Taiwan in those
[3:52:43.440 --> 3:52:44.440]  flights.
[3:52:44.440 --> 3:52:45.440]  Taiwan's not even part of China.
[3:52:45.440 --> 3:52:49.760]  Taiwan's an independent nation that's been trying to free itself from the oppression
[3:52:49.760 --> 3:52:53.160]  of communism for generations now.
[3:52:53.160 --> 3:52:57.360]  But that's China's plan, is to conquer all the nations around it and destroy America
[3:52:57.360 --> 3:53:04.000]  and eventually occupy American soil, take over America after destroying America.
[3:53:04.000 --> 3:53:10.360]  This biological weapon, as long as China is willing to lose up to 15% of its own population,
[3:53:10.360 --> 3:53:13.320]  gives it the perfect weapon to now achieve this goal.
[3:53:13.320 --> 3:53:16.240]  That's why I say this is coming to America.
[3:53:16.240 --> 3:53:22.080]  There is no stopping it because there are forces that want to destroy America and they
[3:53:22.080 --> 3:53:24.440]  know now that everything is at stake.
[3:53:24.440 --> 3:53:28.440]  Plus on top of that, you have the globalist depopulation goals.
[3:53:28.440 --> 3:53:29.960]  They want to depopulate America too.
[3:53:29.960 --> 3:53:31.640]  They want to plunge America into chaos.
[3:53:31.640 --> 3:53:37.200]  In fact, they want to do it before the election because if they can cause enough economic
[3:53:37.200 --> 3:53:44.280]  chaos, they might be able to have Trump defeated even by some left-wing loser like Joe Biden
[3:53:44.280 --> 3:53:50.320]  who was just beaten like a dog in the street or something in the caucus, the primaries.
[3:53:50.320 --> 3:53:59.000]  I mean, Joe Biden can't get votes from Democrats, much less centrist or independence.
[3:53:59.000 --> 3:54:04.920]  But if they could crush the economy, if they could cause panic, if they could blame Trump
[3:54:04.920 --> 3:54:09.960]  for all this and Trump's lack of action to solve this, then they might have a leg up
[3:54:09.960 --> 3:54:10.960]  on this.
[3:54:10.960 --> 3:54:15.600]  So the coronavirus fits into the strategies of China as well as the globalists, as well
[3:54:15.600 --> 3:54:17.040]  as the Democrats.
[3:54:17.040 --> 3:54:21.080]  You can bet the DNC right now would love to see a pandemic in America.
[3:54:21.080 --> 3:54:22.080]  No kidding.
[3:54:22.080 --> 3:54:27.760]  I mean, come on, these DNC, they murder people who have information on Democrats.
[3:54:27.760 --> 3:54:33.280]  Andrew Breitbart, for example, Andrew Breitbart was taken out because he had dirt on Obama
[3:54:33.280 --> 3:54:35.320]  that would have ended Obama's presidency.
[3:54:35.320 --> 3:54:37.320]  They killed Breitbart.
[3:54:37.320 --> 3:54:38.320]  Breitbart was a good man.
[3:54:38.320 --> 3:54:40.040]  He was trying to sound the alarm.
[3:54:40.040 --> 3:54:44.600]  He made the tactical mistake of announcing that he had this video 48 hours before he
[3:54:44.600 --> 3:54:46.720]  was going to release it.
[3:54:46.720 --> 3:54:49.200]  You never do that, folks, because that's when they kill you.
[3:54:49.200 --> 3:54:50.200]  That's why I don't do that.
[3:54:50.200 --> 3:54:52.280]  And frankly, I don't have any such videos.
[3:54:52.280 --> 3:54:55.280]  If I did, I would have already released them for that very reason.
[3:54:55.280 --> 3:54:56.960]  I don't have anything that could get me killed.
[3:54:56.960 --> 3:55:01.840]  I just put it all out there, let the world decide, you know, like Project Veritas, right?
[3:55:01.840 --> 3:55:06.520]  But the thing is, this weapon is coming to America.
[3:55:06.520 --> 3:55:09.000]  And yet most Americans are in a total state of denial.
[3:55:09.000 --> 3:55:11.760]  They don't realize what's going to happen.
[3:55:11.760 --> 3:55:16.920]  Even now, I find it fascinating that Wall Street Journal is catching up to Infowars
[3:55:16.920 --> 3:55:19.960]  on reporting that China is lying about its own numbers.
[3:55:19.960 --> 3:55:21.680]  Isn't that interesting?
[3:55:21.680 --> 3:55:26.280]  So what Infowars reported and what Natural News reported two weeks ago is now being
[3:55:26.280 --> 3:55:31.400]  confirmed by the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and maybe even the Washington
[3:55:31.400 --> 3:55:34.720]  Post soon as they realized China is lying.
[3:55:34.720 --> 3:55:37.080]  But they're not covering what you're hearing here.
[3:55:37.080 --> 3:55:42.960]  Why is China lying because China needs to export the disease, divert blame, and infect
[3:55:42.960 --> 3:55:48.200]  the rest of the world so that China doesn't take the historical blame for this, even while
[3:55:48.200 --> 3:55:52.960]  China will be losing potentially, if it's uncontrolled in China, over 100 million Chinese
[3:55:52.960 --> 3:55:58.000]  people put in vans and carted off to crematoriums.
[3:55:58.000 --> 3:56:04.160]  I mean, we're talking about scenes like the Holocaust here with numbers that dwarf the
[3:56:04.160 --> 3:56:05.160]  Holocaust.
[3:56:05.160 --> 3:56:12.240]  According to official estimates, the Holocaust in late 1930s and 1940s was what, 6 million
[3:56:12.240 --> 3:56:19.400]  Jews were taken to ovens and concentration camps and so on, murdered by the Nazi regime.
[3:56:19.400 --> 3:56:26.560]  The Communist China regime is willing to have 100 million of its own people killed in order
[3:56:26.560 --> 3:56:33.600]  to keep the factories running so that it can continue its strategy of global domination.
[3:56:33.600 --> 3:56:37.040]  And sadly, Trump is late to the game on this.
[3:56:37.040 --> 3:56:43.120]  He is being advised by liars in his administration who aren't telling him the truth about this.
[3:56:43.120 --> 3:56:45.360]  Trump doesn't know how serious this is.
[3:56:45.360 --> 3:56:50.000]  And that's part of the reason why I come on here at InfoWars and urge the people around
[3:56:50.000 --> 3:56:52.800]  the president to let him know what's happening.
[3:56:52.800 --> 3:56:59.400]  China is going to allow potentially 100 million people to die so that they don't lose their
[3:56:59.400 --> 3:57:04.280]  economic power to eventually conquer and crush the United States of America, and they will
[3:57:04.280 --> 3:57:07.400]  likely release this biological weapon in the United States.
[3:57:07.400 --> 3:57:12.960]  And I believe that is likely to happen this year for political reasons related to the
[3:57:12.960 --> 3:57:13.960]  election.
[3:57:13.960 --> 3:57:14.960]  So I hope I'm wrong about all this.
[3:57:14.960 --> 3:57:19.560]  I hope that the communists aren't that evil, but history shows they are.
[3:57:19.560 --> 3:57:22.400]  They mass murder people anytime they need power.
[3:57:22.400 --> 3:57:23.400]  That's what history shows.
[3:57:23.400 --> 3:57:27.640]  I mean, how do you think the communist government got into power in China by mass murdering millions
[3:57:27.640 --> 3:57:28.640]  of people?
[3:57:28.640 --> 3:57:29.640]  I think they'll do it again.
[3:57:29.640 --> 3:57:32.760]  But this is the only place you're going to hear this analysis, even though it's historically
[3:57:32.760 --> 3:57:33.760]  accurate.
[3:57:33.760 --> 3:57:34.760]  But thanks for watching.
[3:57:34.760 --> 3:57:38.080]  Mike Adams here for Infowars.com, more room coming up next.
[3:57:38.080 --> 3:57:58.920]  Stay with us.
