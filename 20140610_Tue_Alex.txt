[00:00.000 --> 00:14.680]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.680 --> 00:42.120]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones well we are certainly
[00:42.120 --> 00:46.520]  engaging the globalist in the infowar right now ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining
[00:46.520 --> 00:57.120]  me on this Tuesday June 10th 2014 worldwide broadcast and we are going to obviously be
[00:57.120 --> 01:03.120]  taking your phone calls and covering all of the incredibly important news that's transpiring
[01:03.120 --> 01:11.720]  I've got to say that the immigration news is so huge and it's not even getting a lot
[01:11.720 --> 01:17.400]  of what you call dinosaur media attention or they blindly report oh yeah third US military
[01:17.400 --> 01:25.720]  base is filling up with the hundreds of thousands of illegal children who just get off airplanes
[01:25.720 --> 01:31.000]  or who are brought across the border and dumped by their parents Obama opens third military
[01:31.000 --> 01:35.480]  base to deal with flood of illegal children immigrants as officials insist they are being
[01:35.480 --> 01:40.720]  cared for despite abuse allegations see even the Daily Mail it's about abuse allegations
[01:40.720 --> 01:49.000]  which is important but but the it comes after the crisis itself the United States is being
[01:49.000 --> 01:59.240]  advertised that if you can get here with leprosy or double amputee or blind child whatever the
[01:59.240 --> 02:08.000]  case is we're going to pay for you as the country goes bankrupt I mean 30 40,000 Cubans
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.680]  in the 80s coming over in a couple of boat flotillas was a big issue because a bunch
[02:13.680 --> 02:19.160]  of them were criminals they call it the Cuban crime wave because Castro was you know dumping
[02:19.160 --> 02:25.080]  a lot of his prisons on to the United States so some of them are good people they were
[02:25.080 --> 02:29.340]  political prisoners and people that was a minority of course they made the fictional
[02:29.340 --> 02:35.200]  scarface written by the great Oliver Stone based on a five-year investigation of real
[02:35.200 --> 02:39.240]  characters he just changed the name of it's basically a true story and I've seen an interview
[02:39.240 --> 02:42.840]  he gave where he broke that down he would spend years with the cartels in Latin America
[02:42.840 --> 02:48.160]  to write that that script also wrote Conan a barbarian interesting enough side issue
[02:48.160 --> 02:53.720]  was his first big break the point is is that this is hundreds of thousands it's estimated
[02:53.720 --> 03:00.360]  over 200,000 already another 260,000 the federal government came out yesterday in a memo and
[03:00.360 --> 03:06.640]  said they think are going to be coming in I mean ladies and gentlemen this has never
[03:06.640 --> 03:14.160]  been done by anybody Obama is literally taking a giant dump on the country and I don't usually
[03:14.160 --> 03:20.960]  use scatological verbiage I don't usually need to you but I mean when it when a shoe
[03:20.960 --> 03:27.880]  fits wear it I mean there's there's no other way to describe the way this country is being
[03:27.880 --> 03:34.480]  gutted our power plants turned off Obamacare meant to stall our country meanwhile you know
[03:34.480 --> 03:40.840]  the other shoes about to drop when they start arresting governors and filmmakers and pro
[03:40.840 --> 03:47.160]  lifers all over the country for their speech persecuting people and then coming out and
[03:47.160 --> 03:53.120]  saying I mean he had Ronald Reagan on his Facebook he had Rand Paul on his Facebook and they've
[03:53.120 --> 04:00.280]  attacked Rand Paul they've attacked Breitbart but but no no Alex Jones we are swamp with
[04:00.280 --> 04:05.840]  the CNN MSNBC clips I mean there's got to be six or seven of them we've already been
[04:05.840 --> 04:10.760]  sent by listeners and there's no way to air all of this or even digest it all we're going
[04:10.760 --> 04:16.560]  to try to play some of it where they are basically saying he did it because of me when everyone
[04:16.560 --> 04:24.200]  knows that I say do not offensively attack anybody and it's the worst thing we could
[04:24.200 --> 04:30.000]  do and it's cold-blooded murder just like killing the kids at Waco because they wanted
[04:30.000 --> 04:36.960]  to kill the parents teach them a lesson it's a horrible crime just because the police represent
[04:36.960 --> 04:42.240]  a corrupt system doesn't mean they're corrupt I mean by that extension if you pay income
[04:42.240 --> 04:45.440]  taxes are you going to get shot in the back of the head in the restaurant because you're
[04:45.440 --> 04:50.400]  funding this I mean I pay him that's a fraudulent tax to a private bank but they'll break your
[04:50.400 --> 04:55.240]  legs if you don't do it see what I'm saying I mean it's like shooting a bank teller because
[04:55.240 --> 05:00.920]  you're mad at JPMorgan Chase or something be right back this is Scottish John for info

[07:12.600 --> 07:17.720]  the NFL has become a political weapon against the second amendment pushes Obamacare MSNBC
[07:17.720 --> 07:21.800]  tells us that our children belong to the state we have to break through our kind of private
[07:21.800 --> 07:25.960]  idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize
[07:25.960 --> 07:30.240]  that kids belong to whole communities it is more important than ever to realize that we

[09:16.840 --> 09:23.840]  people in it the borders are being completely collapsed as we speak the united states is
[09:25.440 --> 09:32.440]  being advertised as a dumping ground for anyone that wants to come here obama is giving them
[09:32.440 --> 09:39.440]  lawyers is freezing deportations is freezing prosecutions of felons if they're illegal
[09:39.560 --> 09:46.040]  for committing arson rape and murder hundreds of thousands of criminals have been released
[09:46.040 --> 09:51.360]  in the last two years alone sixty thousand in the last month sixty three thousand it
[09:51.360 --> 09:57.120]  is full scale destruction of the country the power plants are being shut down half of our
[09:57.120 --> 10:02.760]  energy supply is being shut off right now a devastating tax on everyone a poverty control
[10:02.760 --> 10:08.720]  tax al qaeda is publicly being released and weaponized and let out a prison all over the
[10:08.720 --> 10:14.280]  world and being prepared to attack the united states again they have the former head of
[10:14.280 --> 10:19.280]  these operations alexander of course came out and said that we are going to be hit so
[10:19.280 --> 10:26.280]  give up all of your rights and we are seeing the public conversion of the war on terror
[10:28.440 --> 10:35.440]  supposedly being for muslim extremist a foreign outside threat and as we predicted you're
[10:35.760 --> 10:42.760]  seeing homeland security completely inverted against the tea party libertarians conservatives
[10:42.760 --> 10:49.760]  you name it remember i've been telling you intensely for six years that the system is
[10:50.760 --> 10:57.760]  going to shift homeland security on to the liberty movement aka americana people that
[10:59.480 --> 11:06.480]  want to keep america somewhat free and somewhat free market if you're a milk toast conservative
[11:06.480 --> 11:13.120]  you're being listed as a terrorist and it's a social attempt to intimidate everyone to
[11:13.120 --> 11:19.440]  basically run up a communist flag or a marxist flag or a socialist progressive flag outside
[11:19.440 --> 11:26.440]  of their house in the culture to openly announce yourself with the system or they're saying
[11:27.040 --> 11:34.040]  they'll label you a racist a homophobe or a terrorist and that's what's now happening
[11:34.040 --> 11:41.040]  and if we give into this authoritarianism that is the opposite of thomas jeffersonian
[11:41.040 --> 11:46.840]  liberalism true liberalism means freedom true liberalism was thomas jefferson saying when
[11:46.840 --> 11:52.200]  the government fears the people there is liberty when the people fear the government there
[11:52.200 --> 11:59.200]  is tyranny that would be called terrorism today stating that basic fact and so what
[11:59.200 --> 12:06.200]  we now have unfolding is a total and complete balls to the walls rollout balls to the walls
[12:08.200 --> 12:15.200]  is a aviator term for pedal to the metal shoving the throttle all the way forward and they
[12:15.200 --> 12:31.200]  have shoved it balls to the wall boom as far as it'll go down into the console full power and that tells you they're getting ready to make their move and you notice that going along with glenn beck and others brought to the wall
[12:31.200 --> 12:42.200]  does a lot of great work that site and it's helping libertarianize their hubbocken party and it puts out a lot of great research I'm a big fan of brightbark.com they've had a few of their neo conwriters attack me and say alex jones is linked to violence alex jones is linked to violence
[12:42.200 --> 13:02.200]  is going to cause violence and we've covered that just a few weeks ago and I said you better watch it because A that's not true but B more importantly you're going to get blamed as well.
[13:02.200 --> 13:22.200]  by trying to cozy up to this and now that's all of the news that this supposed shooter one of the two shooters the joker who now we find I was into the satanism and all sorts of just evil which is continually the same M.O.
[13:22.200 --> 13:38.200]  for the real mass shooters is devil worshipping death obsessed pips I've said you want to profile somebody they're always devil worshipping pips into death we don't even know if it's a true story because of the fact that the establishment's been caught staging
[13:38.200 --> 13:58.200]  false flags before on record they've been caught lying about everything under the sun so you can't on the face believe anything they say or do because they admit that they lie to the public routinely in between saying that your children belong to them so this is the archipelago of a
[13:58.200 --> 14:19.200]  bizarreness that we have to navigate but let me quantify it very simply here the fact that info wars dot com is under unmitigated sustained continual hysterical attack is because in all the M.S.
[14:19.200 --> 14:47.200]  NBC and CNN pieces we've got there's like six of them that we found so far they say we need the republicans to stop going down this path and to not be radicalized and to not listen to Alex Jones we need to ostracize him we need to shut him down or it's going to really discredit you republicans
[14:47.200 --> 15:07.200]  just just do not be involved I mean there and three of these clips I've seen they're begging saying we the democrats are going to deescalate the rhetoric we want to be friends we want to be nice now why are they doing that ladies and gentlemen because they're scared to death
[15:07.200 --> 15:29.200]  the White House put runs media matters on record there it's almost all of our former staff at the White House they have weekly briefings and you notice MSNBC CNN all of them follow what media matters says as the script is loaded into the teleprompters so that's why the website's important has hardly any traffic the public doesn't read it
[15:29.200 --> 15:50.200]  but the London Guardian the Associated Press Reuters they all go and get their talking points from there and the talking point is go after Alex Jones and then that is vomited out everywhere to try to scare people away from this broadcast to try to make people not listen to what we have to say and define reality
[15:50.200 --> 16:04.200]  and say this guy did this because he was a fan of Alex Jones remember the supposed Boston bombers we expose they had drills that day we expose evidence of false flag which all came out later
[16:04.200 --> 16:20.200]  that the older brother was under CIA payroll that even came out in mainstream German and Russian news and the Russians had blown his cover so then US news had to cover it I mean that's to be investigated I don't know exactly what happened there but definitely a double agent bare minimum okay there was more going on in Boston than we were told
[16:20.200 --> 16:35.200]  they were trying to kill both of them to cover it up and one brother's pled not guilty nobody even cares about that you know we can play the clip where they said you know they were fans they did it because of Alex Jones and he's deeply racist
[16:35.200 --> 16:42.200]  we have the clip on screen of your TV viewer MSNBC Blames Boston bombing on deeply racist Alex Jones close quote
[16:42.200 --> 16:59.200]  so I've been through this before folks I live this where three cops get killed in Pittsburgh and they say the guy did it for me within two hours and we go to the guy's own postings on the white supremacist websites run by the feds and he openly says he hates me for years and wants to get me and I better watch it
[16:59.200 --> 17:18.200]  never said anything nice about me attack me on my own website but they said he did it for me so see I'm used to this ladies and gentlemen so we did find one of the clips of literally hundreds where I said during the Bundy Ranch event I would look for them to kill cops
[17:18.200 --> 17:33.200]  shut up Patsy's and blame it on Alex Jones we have that clip we're going to play it in a moment I've been living this for almost 20 years fact more than 20 years is towards Humphries pointed out on air when he was a guest yesterday I've known George about 21 years
[17:33.200 --> 17:48.200]  I've been involved at least 22 but on air 19 and a half I've been through it folks and for a normal person who hasn't seen all this crazy stuff
[17:48.200 --> 18:10.200]  criminals just have no idea how bizarre the globalist are and that they're psychologically predisposed to commit crimes the same way over and over again everybody's pathological everybody does things the same way or tends to but with criminals in their psychology
[18:10.200 --> 18:28.200]  it's like a dog to their vomit over and over again they do the same thing and so you learn the patterns and sometimes it's a real attack but then you look at how statistically it's incredibly rare and in every MSNBC clip we've got
[18:28.200 --> 18:42.200]  to play over and over again it's an epidemic it's an epidemic it's an epidemic you go up to info wars.com Indiana Sheriff we need military equipment because US is a war zone and there's an epidemic of veteran violence go look at the statistics we've written an article about it
[18:42.200 --> 19:00.200]  it's not true there is no epidemic mass shootings are flat overall shootings are down 52% just departments own numbers but they don't care they say we've got to have all these weapons across America police departments are quietly preparing for war with who the tea party gun owners and veterans
[19:00.200 --> 19:18.200]  that's the globalist takeover but it will become a self-profilling prophecy if they stage the events and if they stage some events or hype it enough Patriots going to kill cops Patriots going to kill cops there will be naturally organic crazies
[19:18.200 --> 19:34.200]  of the same profile it's always weird devil worshipping people that dress up like DC comic characters and who are into death who go out and who are on drugs and who have criminal records that go out and do this
[19:34.200 --> 19:50.200]  when it's real and then you've got the media editing things like that like the what the the White House media matters this is key this is coming up runs this clip where I say it's totally staged
[19:50.200 --> 19:59.200]  of course we're going to get the full clip you got to find it the three hour show because I remember saying it's either organically the evil culture has done it or it was staged

[24:37.200 --> 24:59.200]  so the federal government is openly buying millions of rounds of ammo deploying weaponized drones against the American people publicly announcing it deploying thousands and thousands of giant armored wheeled tanks and openly saying their main enemy is returning veterans who are going to be attacking police when none of that's happening
[24:59.200 --> 25:19.200]  you've got the media saying I'm going to cause people to kill cops for years and then now magically it's happening can you say set up bare minimum as I said about ten times yesterday this is being sponsored by the sick culture of death
[25:19.200 --> 25:38.200]  this is the culture of death general mass mind control of a sick society obsessed with torture porn obsessed with destruction porn I mean even CNN an article about Godzilla and why are we obsessed with destruction porn
[25:38.200 --> 25:56.200]  and girls going out stabbing other girls because they're a fan of you know a comic book character that stabs people what's he called skinny man thin man slender man yeah all of this going on and people killing in the name of the Joker
[25:56.200 --> 26:10.200]  there's no discussion about how sick the society is or why is it always the same MO when it's a real event another stabbing is now been linked to the slender man meme
[26:10.200 --> 26:29.200]  there's no discussion of these people always in the macabre and Satanism and death and the nihilistic society it's no Ronald Reagan was on somebody's Facebook so it's Ronald Reagan's fault I mean I'm right next to Ronald Reagan on his website a Ronald Reagan speech on the supposed you know ring
[26:29.200 --> 26:53.200]  leader shooter on his Facebook that's like saying the police in Southern California are guilty because Dorner was a cop and went and shot people it's just incredible I stand for what I stand for and that is no
[26:53.200 --> 27:08.200]  offensive violence and the last thing you want to do even if a civil war starts I've said is go after the rank and fall general minions of the system you want to reach out to them and wake them up and we want to stop this civil war from happening
[27:08.200 --> 27:20.200]  that the globalist are clearly gearing up for and admitting they're preparing for that's the big issue is that they're telling us to square off and kill each other that's the big scandal
[27:20.200 --> 27:31.200]  and then using tragic events like this that we stand against every day to then projected onto us
[27:31.200 --> 27:43.200]  this is what's happening this is the framing of the future battle space before it all kicks off and I hope we can stop it from kicking off because it's going to be bad for every American in this country
[27:43.200 --> 27:52.200]  I know most police are informed and awake and care about their communities and do want to protect and serve and have not been federalized and a lot of feds are good people
[27:52.200 --> 28:02.200]  but if this civil war kicks off it's going to be hellish and if the police and military think a bunch of armored vehicles and helicopters are going to do anything
[28:02.200 --> 28:15.200]  in a asymmetrical civil war it's going to be like hell on earth in this country Americans and libertarians and patriots and veterans whose backs are against the wall
[28:15.200 --> 28:26.200]  is going to look like millions of rambos turned loose in the country against the globalist I mean it is going to be a disaster
[28:26.200 --> 28:35.200]  millions of former military special forces you name it who know they're targeted who know they're being demonized it's all public
[28:35.200 --> 28:44.200]  and your PSYOP doesn't work against them and they're sitting there watching it all happen and trying to keep their head down not looking for trouble
[28:44.200 --> 28:55.200]  but the social engineers the psych warfare chiefs at the White House and MSNBC and CNN think you're so stupid
[28:55.200 --> 29:02.200]  that you're just going to go along with it
[29:02.200 --> 29:08.200]  they're not buying billions of rounds of ammo and admitting they're gearing up for war with the Tea Party for nothing
[29:08.200 --> 29:15.200]  notice the Tea Party is doing nothing nothing violent has done nothing and they just keep saying we're going to kill we're going to attack it's going to happen
[29:15.200 --> 29:19.200]  so I'm saying hey they might stage something they have a history of it
[29:19.200 --> 29:27.200]  we're going to come back and play all the clips and then magically it happens right in Harry Reid's state right in that city
[29:27.200 --> 29:36.200]  and the whole thing reads like something scripted just like the Bo Bergdahl situation all of it
[29:36.200 --> 29:43.200]  these are people that get on MSNBC and say we lied to you and said drones didn't exist when they do
[29:43.200 --> 29:48.200]  nevermind the man behind the curtain I mean we can't believe anything they say they stage fast and furious folks

[33:42.200 --> 33:46.200]  there were 31 shootings over the weekend
[33:46.200 --> 33:54.200]  four of them fatal in chicago but that's just another weekend in chicago with the gunband
[33:54.200 --> 33:57.200]  meanwhile two police get killed a citizen gets killed
[33:57.200 --> 34:00.200]  and then the two reported shooters get killed
[34:00.200 --> 34:07.200]  and before they even magically connected it to a facebook that had rand paul brightbart alex jones
[34:07.200 --> 34:13.200]  ronald reagan on it they were already blaming me and then magically of course it's all my fault
[34:13.200 --> 34:22.200]  so I've been through this over and over again but this isn't about alex jones it signifies that the establishment is making their move
[34:22.200 --> 34:28.200]  on so many fronts to convert homeland security completely over from outside al-qaeda
[34:28.200 --> 34:32.200]  who they publicly run who they publicly have had killed over 300,000 syrians
[34:32.200 --> 34:38.200]  and who they publicly have been caught launching multiple chemical attacks on syria and on civilians
[34:38.200 --> 34:41.200]  to then try to blame the syrian government
[34:41.200 --> 34:47.200]  and they got caught nato and turkey bbc even had to admit launching those
[34:47.200 --> 34:56.200]  and it's sy harsh's reported on it new yorker magazine confirmed staged by nato and obama is involved
[34:56.200 --> 35:01.200]  the obama administration is quarterbacking the funding and the weaponizing so
[35:01.200 --> 35:07.200]  I want to ask this question of media matters and msnbc and folks that work for the white house
[35:07.200 --> 35:12.200]  I understand your leftist ideologues it's all about power I understand you know your authoritarians
[35:12.200 --> 35:17.200]  and that you're basically psychologists that manipulate the public and I know you know who you are
[35:17.200 --> 35:20.200]  but you really are signing on to some evil
[35:20.200 --> 35:26.200]  we do have the cbs memo the reporter had to quit and leave cbs we're gonna get her on the show in the near future
[35:26.200 --> 35:30.200]  because it was so censored but she got the memo
[35:30.200 --> 35:35.200]  and I wondered how cbs broke it well she just did her job and it got to the cracks
[35:35.200 --> 35:41.200]  that they were staging fast and furious that killed thousands of mexico hundreds here
[35:41.200 --> 35:45.200]  including seven at least quote law enforcement officers most of them border patrol
[35:45.200 --> 35:49.200]  that was done to blame the second amendment
[35:49.200 --> 35:54.200]  now before that memo came out we were saying obviously it's a false flag to blame the second amendment
[35:54.200 --> 35:59.200]  and it came out it was a false flag to blame the second amendment and you can pull up the cbs memo
[35:59.200 --> 36:08.200]  just type it into the search engine that of the term
[36:08.200 --> 36:14.200]  pull up the exact thing from memory you type into the search engine
[36:14.200 --> 36:22.200]  why house or justice department wanted to use fast and furious restrict second amendment
[36:22.200 --> 36:25.200]  and then you've got the memo right there
[36:25.200 --> 36:31.200]  so if they've done false flags before
[36:31.200 --> 36:35.200]  if they've done this before
[36:35.200 --> 36:39.200]  and they have a history of it and they get on tv and admit that they lied to us
[36:39.200 --> 36:43.200]  and they laugh at us and they say raising debt limits doesn't raise that limits
[36:43.200 --> 36:47.200]  and they say if you have a business you didn't build it and your kids belong to the state
[36:47.200 --> 36:51.200]  and obama care has lowered your premiums even though it's increased them on average
[36:51.200 --> 36:56.200]  and you can keep your doctor there it is cbs news documents atf use fast and furious
[36:56.200 --> 36:59.200]  to make the case for gun regulations
[36:59.200 --> 37:06.200]  and you read the article and they go on to admit that it was a setup to blame that
[37:06.200 --> 37:10.200]  fast and furious to argue for controversial new rules about gun sales
[37:10.200 --> 37:15.200]  documents obtained by cbs news show that the bureau buckled back on firearms and explosives
[37:15.200 --> 37:21.200]  discuss using their covert operation to blame the second amendment
[37:21.200 --> 37:25.200]  and then you can click through the article and see the documents in the timeline
[37:25.200 --> 37:30.200]  okay so let's say there's a neighbor who's a convicted bank robber
[37:30.200 --> 37:34.200]  you got a neighbor who's a convicted bank robber and then there's a bank robbery
[37:34.200 --> 37:40.200]  a month after he moves in and you see his description on the news
[37:40.200 --> 37:46.200]  that it's 60 or so old man with gray hair and a long beard
[37:46.200 --> 37:52.200]  and you're looking out your back window at your neighbor who's just bought a new car
[37:52.200 --> 37:55.200]  and is eating a bunch of filet mignon in his backyard
[37:55.200 --> 38:00.200]  and he didn't have any money the week before and you're in a working class neighborhood
[38:00.200 --> 38:05.200]  you're gonna start to think maybe my neighbor robbed the bank
[38:05.200 --> 38:09.200]  he looks like he just came into a bunch of money he fits the description
[38:09.200 --> 38:14.200]  and I know he's a convicted bank robber
[38:14.200 --> 38:19.200]  so if you were started thinking maybe Bob's the guy that just robbed the bank
[38:19.200 --> 38:23.200]  he doesn't have a job but he just bought a new car
[38:23.200 --> 38:30.200]  are you a conspiracy theorist for thinking he may be a suspect
[38:30.200 --> 38:34.200]  that's my issue now I want to go through some of these clips but MSNBC
[38:34.200 --> 38:40.200]  London Guardian CNN they're all playing this clip directly off White House run media matters
[38:40.200 --> 38:45.200]  MSNBC quotes Alex Jones
[38:45.200 --> 38:49.200]  and they take my clip and again I remember this on the show yesterday you heard it
[38:49.200 --> 38:53.200]  we're gonna try to find in the three hours on the timeline where I said it
[38:53.200 --> 38:56.200]  but I know right after I said this it was during the first hour
[38:56.200 --> 39:01.200]  if I had to say I'd say 35 minutes 36 minutes 30s right around there in the show is where my memory
[39:01.200 --> 39:06.200]  thinks I said this but I said this a couple times so I'm not sure
[39:06.200 --> 39:11.200]  I said this is staged ladies and gentlemen my gut tells me it's staged
[39:11.200 --> 39:18.200]  either by the sick general mind control of the love of death torture porn murder porn
[39:18.200 --> 39:24.200]  shoot them up video game death goth Satanism culture
[39:24.200 --> 39:31.200]  or it's been staged by a government that has a long history of staging false flags
[39:31.200 --> 39:35.200]  of blame the second amendment and it's even in operation Northwoods with a pentagon
[39:35.200 --> 39:39.200]  wanted to stage mass shootings and blame it on their political enemies
[39:39.200 --> 39:44.200]  but JFK said no and that's ABC news
[39:44.200 --> 39:50.200]  look it up operation Northwoods ABC news 2001 declassified nine months before 9-11
[39:50.200 --> 39:55.200]  was in January of that year
[39:55.200 --> 40:01.200]  so that's the issue here this could be real
[40:01.200 --> 40:06.200]  but you can believe they can go on planet info wars dot com message boards
[40:06.200 --> 40:11.200]  anybody could people go create fake profiles of me on Facebook Twitter
[40:11.200 --> 40:16.200]  there's all sorts of anti Alex Jones campaigns where they send people mean letters in my name
[40:16.200 --> 40:21.200]  program the company fax machine people get that number program that and send threats to the police department
[40:21.200 --> 40:27.200]  and the cops call me and say Alex you didn't send these death threats does did you the detective this is years ago
[40:27.200 --> 40:31.200]  and I went and what death threats over a fax machine
[40:31.200 --> 40:37.200]  is this your fax number yeah you didn't send these death threats well no
[40:37.200 --> 40:40.200]  yeah we figured that it's easy to spoof that reprogram it
[40:40.200 --> 40:45.200]  I mean all I'm saying is ladies and gentlemen I've been the victim of this
[40:45.200 --> 40:51.200]  so who knows who these cutouts are these a multi-time excon
[40:51.200 --> 40:56.200]  perfect cutout we don't know and they'll take an informant they'll tell them they're part of a drill
[40:56.200 --> 40:59.200]  they'll set them up I don't know if that's what happened here
[40:59.200 --> 41:03.200]  but either it's part of the sick culture
[41:03.200 --> 41:07.200]  the general ambient mind control of just evil
[41:07.200 --> 41:13.200]  demon possession whatever you want to call it evil is out there evil lives
[41:13.200 --> 41:19.200]  or it was a staged event in Harry Reid's district with Harry Reid's controlled police
[41:19.200 --> 41:24.200]  I mean he's a mafia Don in Vegas ladies and gentlemen his whole family just openly
[41:24.200 --> 41:30.200]  almost his whole family granddaughters sons you name it get campaign money for weddings
[41:30.200 --> 41:33.200]  don't get in trouble they do things let's not exaggerate
[41:33.200 --> 41:37.200]  10,000 times worse than what Dinesh D'Souza did
[41:37.200 --> 41:43.200]  his thing was a technical deal for not calling it a pack when he got four friends to give money to his friend
[41:43.200 --> 41:49.200]  Crooked toenail Dinesh D'Souza facing ten years in prison
[41:49.200 --> 41:52.200]  filmmaker because he made him mad he was on the show yesterday
[41:52.200 --> 41:56.200]  I mean they'll do anything they're coming after people
[41:56.200 --> 42:04.200]  he gives his sons all these big Senate contracts Chinese energy deal contracts
[42:04.200 --> 42:12.200]  and he's involved with Acron just he's involved with Jack Abramoff
[42:12.200 --> 42:16.200]  and let me tell you he's a real gangster folks I'm going up against a real gangster
[42:16.200 --> 42:21.200]  I need your prayers I'm not saying I'm macho I'm not saying I'm tough
[42:21.200 --> 42:25.200]  I'm doing something real here this isn't a game it's not a joke
[42:25.200 --> 42:34.200]  this is the real deal this broadcast and you know most people couldn't handle the pressure
[42:34.200 --> 42:41.200]  I'm not bragging by the way saying hey man I'm taking on a lot I'm just saying
[42:41.200 --> 42:47.200]  expect me to not have all the answers expect me to get things wrong
[42:47.200 --> 42:51.200]  expect me to be under stress and act like a jerk sometimes
[42:51.200 --> 42:56.200]  and to stammer and cut off guests and people because I'm so real ladies and gentlemen
[42:56.200 --> 43:00.200]  I can't put on an act I don't know how to
[43:00.200 --> 43:06.200]  and I'm going up against totally evil people who we know have committed all these crimes before
[43:06.200 --> 43:11.200]  and who've been caught and we know their MO and they're militarizing the police
[43:11.200 --> 43:16.200]  and now every time a car backfires you know they say it's a school shooting and shut down areas
[43:16.200 --> 43:20.200]  and they're training us all to live as prisoners as militarized police are deployed
[43:20.200 --> 43:26.200]  and as all of America turns into something that resembles Boston in the aftermath of the Boston bombing
[43:26.200 --> 43:32.200]  they have routine checkpoints now on highways where you pull up and the cops all aim M16s at you
[43:32.200 --> 43:38.200]  even though you don't match the description to just get you used to living in Fallujah
[43:38.200 --> 43:44.200]  and in dozens and dozens of Army documents that are public they say and the FBI says
[43:44.200 --> 43:48.200]  and the police say we are training for a war with the Tea Party
[43:48.200 --> 43:52.200]  and the veterans and the gun owners and I've said hundreds of times
[43:52.200 --> 43:58.200]  over and over and over and over again you've heard me here
[43:58.200 --> 44:02.200]  it's like saying prove the Atlantic Ocean exists it's right there
[44:02.200 --> 44:06.200]  and I need the listeners to go into all the files all the shows
[44:06.200 --> 44:09.200]  in the last few months where I've been saying they're going to shoot cops
[44:09.200 --> 44:13.200]  and they're going to try to connect it to us and blame us I need you to find those clips so we can play them here
[44:13.200 --> 44:21.200]  because we're too busy covering them now to dig all that out even though I literally say it every day every hour
[44:21.200 --> 44:24.200]  we just need you the listeners to go to the Bundy Ranch coverage
[44:24.200 --> 44:28.200]  go in there when I talk about false flags and what they're planning
[44:28.200 --> 44:34.200]  and to find those clips and put them on YouTube we need your organic help to be able to do this as well
[44:34.200 --> 44:40.200]  because we're not at the Atlantic Ocean we're here in Austin Texas but many of you are on the Atlantic to use the analogy
[44:40.200 --> 44:44.200]  you're there watching the show each day you know where those clips are we need your help
[44:44.200 --> 44:51.200]  we're so overwhelmed it's like they've got a batting cage machine shooting balls every second boom boom boom
[44:51.200 --> 44:57.200]  so fast we can't even hit the balls is the analogy I would use
[44:57.200 --> 45:05.200]  so this isn't about Alex Jones folks it's about the fact that you could argue well you're so goofy
[45:05.200 --> 45:10.200]  and you're so discredited that they use you as a poster boy to discredit libertarian ideas
[45:10.200 --> 45:14.200]  no no that's the surface level
[45:14.200 --> 45:19.200]  this show is exploding in popularity and we have the globalist number
[45:19.200 --> 45:23.200]  and so much of what we said has now been proven to be accurate and coming true
[45:23.200 --> 45:30.200]  we know their M.O. if this ever becomes mainstream which it's starting to that's it for them
[45:30.200 --> 45:35.200]  and I'm willing to take the heat to say it first I'm willing to hit the barbed wire as the shop troops in the info war
[45:35.200 --> 45:40.200]  and take one for the team because I realize how bad these people are I really want to oppose them
[45:40.200 --> 45:45.200]  I'm stepping up to the plate against them
[45:45.200 --> 45:54.200]  so we need your prayers we need your financial support now more than ever because they've launched a soft Democratic Party campaign on Facebook
[45:54.200 --> 46:00.200]  to contact everybody associated with this operation to contact our affiliates to contact everybody and say
[46:00.200 --> 46:05.200]  oh my god you're supporting a cop killer when everyone knows my show says do not go out and kill people
[46:05.200 --> 46:10.200]  they're going to blame us for this and then now you see them doing it
[46:10.200 --> 46:15.200]  see this show stands for what we cover if Obama's bankrupting the country shutting off the power plants
[46:15.200 --> 46:20.200]  opening the borders to illegals persecuting the press persecuting the Tea Party
[46:20.200 --> 46:27.200]  engaged in classical authoritarian moves and then they militarize the police train them to go after the Tea Party and Liberty Movement
[46:27.200 --> 46:34.200]  and then people really start fighting back it's the globalist that started the Civil War not me that tried to stop it
[46:34.200 --> 46:41.200]  and see that's the secret right there the main reason they hate my guts is I figured out what they're planning
[46:41.200 --> 46:46.200]  from reading their declassified and public documents because they're getting ready to go operational
[46:46.200 --> 46:53.200]  we were getting these from FBI federal marshals state police and others in 2009 2010 when nobody else was getting them
[46:53.200 --> 46:58.200]  and they were national news remember how crazy it sounded that the military trained to take on veterans
[46:58.200 --> 47:06.200]  and gun owners and libertarians couldn't be true now it's on the news every day because they're getting ready to roll it out folks
[47:06.200 --> 47:15.200]  we saw it before it came that's the proof they were gearing up for it before it ever happened
[47:15.200 --> 47:24.200]  not because they had a crystal ball ladies and gentlemen but because they were training to stage the false flags
[47:24.200 --> 47:31.200]  to then get the revolution started they're the revolutionaries it's their globalist revolution against America
[47:31.200 --> 47:37.200]  look at how we're being conquered by foreign banks with Obamacare look at how we're conquered with foreign banks to banker bailouts
[47:37.200 --> 47:42.200]  look at how our borders are wide open and they're saying bring any poor kids here we'll take them
[47:42.200 --> 47:50.200]  this country is going down half the country's power comes from coal 52% they're shutting most of them down right now
[47:50.200 --> 47:59.200]  power prices are going down an enemy army would cut would cut our power off folks it's an enemy operation
[47:59.200 --> 48:08.200]  it's collaborators they're bringing us to our knees to put us on welfare we're being domesticated right now
[48:08.200 --> 48:15.200]  that's the Soviet model take the kids raise them by the state domesticate the parents we're going under domestication right now
[48:15.200 --> 48:21.200]  so we're going to try to find the clip just because it's stunningly powerful from yesterday when I said this is stage
[48:21.200 --> 48:28.200]  ladies and gentlemen and my gut tells me that it's either criminal elements of the Democratic Party with the stage black ops
[48:28.200 --> 48:35.200]  setting up patsies in a drill or it's the organic sick culture that's been promoted by the globalist that's causing this
[48:35.200 --> 48:43.200]  with that particular profile of the devil worshiper pibb that keep pibbs that keep doing this
[48:43.200 --> 48:49.200]  okay when I say person in black I ain't talking about Johnny cash folks I'm not against people like to wear black most of our nice people
[48:49.200 --> 48:59.200]  and artists and folks the whole point is is that it's that particular subset continues to pop up not the tea party not returning veterans
[48:59.200 --> 49:07.200]  and they're getting ready folks this I've never seen such a full court press assault from CNN
[49:07.200 --> 49:15.200]  Anderson Cooper just all of them now here's MSNBC quoting Alex Jones but again out of context
[49:15.200 --> 49:21.200]  and I stand by it could be the government and my gut tells me that something stinks here
[49:21.200 --> 49:29.200]  just like day one I said I didn't buy the burgdoll story on that Sunday and then it all came out everything we said it was totally phony
[49:29.200 --> 49:37.200]  we were the first to say that that I told my reporters on Saturday don't go with this when it first broke on Friday on Saturday
[49:37.200 --> 49:44.200]  I talked to him I said because we can't prove it yet I'm sick of being out front just wait
[49:44.200 --> 49:53.200]  if you've got people that were in his unit I want proof on Monday those conversations happened
[49:53.200 --> 49:59.200]  I just we know how these operations are run we know when something's fake let's go to the MSNBC club
[49:59.200 --> 50:13.200]  but on the airwaves today conspiracy theorist Alex Jones of whom Jared Miller was allegedly a fan of Alex Jones fomented even more anti government paranoia
[50:13.200 --> 50:28.200]  we're in the middle of a globalist revolution against this country right now and my gut tells me that the cold blooded degenerate evil
[50:28.200 --> 50:42.200]  killing of two police officers and a citizen in Las Vegas yesterday is absolutely staged ladies and gentlemen
[50:42.200 --> 50:50.200]  joining me now is the host of MSNBC's the read report joy read joy this keeps getting stranger and more distressing by the hour
[50:50.200 --> 50:56.200]  see there are two pieces here this is all junior high school they all shake their heads and laugh you mean we're no liars

[54:12.200 --> 54:32.200]  enjoy this keeps getting stranger and more distressing by the hour there are two pieces here one seems to be the epidemic of mass violence and mass shootings in public spaces the other is the zealotry of the far far right fringe and Alex Jones is
[54:32.200 --> 54:42.200]  unbowed yeah and I think that second piece is really important because here you had a couple who both were drawn to Nevada to support Clive and Bundy
[54:42.200 --> 54:54.200]  notice they say the same thing over and over again there's an epidemic of mass shootings well when the movie Jaws came out and we've shown the mainstream news articles from the time in the newspaper
[54:54.200 --> 55:06.200]  Xorts had to put ads out in the 70s early 70s for five years straight they have the same stories every year editorial saying sharks only kill less than 10 people a year worldwide
[55:06.200 --> 55:13.200]  you have a better chance of being struck twice by lightning in a year and dying from that that you do from sharks
[55:13.200 --> 55:32.200]  but people still to this day decades later Jaws came out when like 73-74 still swimming worldwide has gone down in warm seas like the Caribbean that great whites aren't even in because of that movie
[55:32.200 --> 55:44.200]  and it is the exact same thing here mass shootings are flat overall shootings are down unless you're in Chicago or Mexico and that's just a fact
[55:44.200 --> 55:54.200]  but she says there's an epidemic see everything comes out of their mouth is a liar distortion then she says something is true and they say this in all the different clips they say Alex Jones doesn't care
[55:54.200 --> 56:10.200]  he's unbowed then they have the southern property law center expert on these other experts on and they're going oh my gosh he's radicalizing the Republicans oh my gosh they've got to stop they've got to denouncing
[56:10.200 --> 56:22.200]  because ladies and gentlemen if what I'm saying the talking points I'm putting out that are based in reality and facts and research get picked up by the Republican Party it's over
[56:22.200 --> 56:36.200]  the Republican Party is being taken over by Libertarians right now in almost every midterm primary happening right now hardcore Libertarian Tea Party Patriots are winning
[56:36.200 --> 56:47.200]  and MSNBC does shows every week saying look at this Republican he's an Alex Jones listener don't vote for him here he is plugging Alex Jones this guy or that guy at the state level
[56:47.200 --> 57:04.200]  at this federal level dude don't vote for him and then they win by landslide let me just say this all the new world order can do is kill me by demonizing me you just make me a folk hero
[57:04.200 --> 57:15.200]  and I can feel the danger by the way I'm not pleased by any of this I feel sick at my stomach but it's a job I've got to do and I'm going to do it and I'm going to follow this through all the way to the end no matter what happens
[57:15.200 --> 57:27.200]  no matter the price maybe we're going to follow through on this like Winston Churchill said we shall go on to the end whatever the costs will be we shall defend our island we shall never surrender
[57:27.200 --> 57:42.200]  well I shall defend this Republic and the idea is a freedom and I will never surrender I don't care how many crimes you blame on me I don't care if you claim that I'm responsible for the crucifixion of Jesus Christ or the sinking of the Lusitania
[57:42.200 --> 57:55.200]  or the Titanic I didn't do it I stand for freedom I'm against killing police officers and people ought to be glad I'm on air trying to tell radicalized folks have been pushed by the system don't be violent
[57:55.200 --> 58:05.200]  every day because that's what I believe and that's why they're saying I want violence because they want to kick a civil war off and they don't want us stopping it
[58:05.200 --> 58:17.200]  we have billions of listeners if you go out there and try to stop the civil war if you go out there and try to be nice to police and inform them if you go out and communicate with them instead of us getting in a war with them we're going to defeat the globalists peacefully
[58:17.200 --> 58:21.200]  they don't like that
[58:21.200 --> 58:26.200]  I mean we got a bunch of Al Sharpton Cliffs folks that are coming up where he literally is trying to start a war
[58:26.200 --> 58:37.200]  they're the ones saying you're racist if you don't want to turn your guns in they're the ones saying that the Tea Party is going to engage in terrorism with no evidence and then it starts happening it's very suspicious
[58:37.200 --> 58:49.200]  I mean these people funded Al Qaeda the stage false flags I mean they'll do anything they got caught funding Al Qaeda to blow up churches all over the world I mean of course they're suspects
[58:49.200 --> 58:56.200]  general what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential force hood situation
[58:56.200 --> 58:59.200]  the police are shoving people shoving Alex shoving the crowd
[58:59.200 --> 59:01.200]  here we go folks I'm being a sideshifter
[59:01.200 --> 59:05.200]  whether it's the radio show the news websites documentary films or the nightly news
[59:05.200 --> 59:07.200]  in fall wars is the tip of the spear
[59:07.200 --> 59:13.200]  is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homeland security by sticking the hands down on the fence on the streets
[59:13.200 --> 59:20.200]  it's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere and that's what prisonplanet.tv is designed to do
[59:20.200 --> 59:28.200]  you watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels
[59:28.200 --> 59:32.200]  what we see now is a war against reality it's a war against the truth
[59:32.200 --> 59:42.200]  it's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of prisonplanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family
[59:42.200 --> 1:00:04.200]  for more news.com today become a member share your membership and help take the info war to the next level
[1:00:04.200 --> 1:00:17.200]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:00:17.200 --> 1:00:24.200]  and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[1:00:24.200 --> 1:00:33.200]  well I want to open the phones up for everybody but I want to speak on a topic and that is do you agree with me or disagree with me that the established was trying to cause a civil war
[1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:46.200]  I mean they're publicly saying there's going to be a war with the Tea Party veterans gun owners and states rights advocates and the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007
[1:00:46.200 --> 1:00:54.200]  that was under Bush says that the Homeland Security is to suppress insurrection by the states and by legislatures
[1:00:54.200 --> 1:01:03.200]  so they consider states that say no to a gun ban or something or no to a federal thing on gay marriage or something
[1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:11.200]  they the feds are saying that's insurrection and they're going to put the big red one the army in your statehouse
[1:01:11.200 --> 1:01:22.200]  see that's what's so frustrating I see the battle picture here I live this and I try to war game stuff out where I'm wrong and I'm just not wrong
[1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:37.200]  and I mourn preemptively for myself my family but I care about the general public and police officers and the military people as much as I care about myself I have empathy
[1:01:37.200 --> 1:01:48.200]  sometimes I care about other people more than I care about myself and it's not because I'm a hero folks my head is screwed on straight
[1:01:48.200 --> 1:01:53.200]  I like inviting people over cooking food and watching them eat it and enjoy it
[1:01:53.200 --> 1:02:01.200]  and I've run into sociopaths before that I've been so nice to and later I learned they were sociopaths and they go you're being nice to me because you want to get something
[1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:09.200]  I've learned people that don't have Texas hospitality and I call it Texas hospitality everybody's got it some extent in their area
[1:02:09.200 --> 1:02:20.200]  that I grew up around people that were so good that I was bad in the family but compared to the general public I'm like a saint or something
[1:02:20.200 --> 1:02:27.200]  I mean I thought everybody was like my parents and my grandparents growing up and it's just taking me the last five years to figure out that's not the case
[1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:35.200]  but that there are also people out there just as good or better than my folks there are a lot of good people in this world there's also a lot of bad people
[1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:45.200]  and those of you that have discernment out there and know what's really going on here you're going to have to figure out what you're going to do for yourself
[1:02:45.200 --> 1:02:55.200]  but I used to get annoyed because I wasn't cocky I come off as an egotist I'm not I'm confident about people how great Texas was
[1:02:55.200 --> 1:03:07.200]  Texas culture and Texas values and Texas toughness and I was really annoyed by it and kind of rebelled against it I was like sick of Texas flags and sick of hearing about my family being involved on both sides of the founding of Texas
[1:03:07.200 --> 1:03:15.200]  and sick of people talking about how great Texas was until I got older and really learned about it all and went all over the world in the country
[1:03:15.200 --> 1:03:23.200]  and man I got to tell you now I've been I've been a lot of places folks Texas has a lot of bad in it too a lot of half people here aren't even Texans
[1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:31.200]  but I just think back about the whole world and just that combination of Texas realness
[1:03:31.200 --> 1:03:46.200]  and some of the Texans I know that just literally boil over with goodness and with manliness and with honorableness and we're just ready to kick your assness
[1:03:46.200 --> 1:03:59.200]  and I'm talking about black Texans white Texans Hispanic Texans you name it I just love Texas I don't know why I'm getting off into that but you know when stuff gets bad you think about what you like and what you appreciate
[1:03:59.200 --> 1:04:12.200]  and the older I get all I've got is that I'm honorable that's all I've got it's all any of us will ever have and that's why the system always tries to attack my honor
[1:04:12.200 --> 1:04:20.200]  I never used to know what chivalry meant it seems so silly reading history books about people that would kill you if you said they were a liar a fraud
[1:04:20.200 --> 1:04:30.200]  and now I understand why because any good civilization is based on truth and justice and people valuing that
[1:04:30.200 --> 1:04:40.200]  and I realize now that in such a decadent slimy world I do see a lot of truth and justice in the military and the police
[1:04:40.200 --> 1:04:52.200]  and so I see things that I admire there but then there's also bad in there so then it makes it that much worse that there's such good shitting right next to such dishonor
[1:04:52.200 --> 1:05:10.200]  that's why people get so mad at the police I don't know what it is Ralph just won't pay any attention to me when he comes home from work all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep

[1:08:49.200 --> 1:09:02.200]  two police officers being dead is the center of the universe not that they care about cops when cops get killed in chicago every few weeks it's not even in the news it's a it's a blurb
[1:09:02.200 --> 1:09:15.200]  because it's gang related but boy if you can tie it to gun owners of the tea party it's an epidemic as big an epidemic as great white shark attacks it's extremely rare
[1:09:15.200 --> 1:09:26.200]  and they know that but they don't care it's an epidemic it's an epidemic we've got to stop the radicalization of the republican party yeah that makes them win elections everywhere
[1:09:26.200 --> 1:09:41.200]  and they admit these clips they go it is politically expedient for the republicans to be doing this and giving sucker to alex jones suker aiding and abetting they even use the term that they're aiding and abetting me
[1:09:41.200 --> 1:09:57.200]  I'm aiding and abetting the election of libertarian pro gun pro family pro power plant pro jobs pro factories mom and dad the kids belong to them americana
[1:09:57.200 --> 1:10:16.200]  we shouldn't put an ad out saying you got kids put them on a plane we'll take them so there's just planes landing with 137 kids 129 kids 14 kids 80 kids I mean every couple hours planes are landing with just kids on board
[1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:29.200]  from nicaragua el salvador brazil mexico china taiwan people are getting their kids on planes and they're landing and they're here folks and the government's giving them lawyers and they're staying
[1:10:29.200 --> 1:10:40.200]  and they're hiring illegals to work for the federal government and giving them waivers and 30 million are here under the new garbage obama's trying to pass all their families can then come
[1:10:40.200 --> 1:10:54.200]  I mean we're bankrupt folks you'd be one thing if we got unskilled labor here and they had to you know work in the free market like all the other poor immigrants that came here but that's not what's happening
[1:10:54.200 --> 1:11:03.200]  they're now putting water stations and emergency phones in the desert to aid the illegals coming across
[1:11:03.200 --> 1:11:15.200]  I've been down to the border two months ago there's no border patrol there I was there last year it was teaming with border patrol but they weren't even stopping illegals they were ordered to give people tickets for beer and stuff in Big Bend
[1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:27.200]  but now there was no border patrol I told you this two months ago it's gone the deportations have virtually stopped lawlessness it's illegal ladies and gentlemen
[1:11:27.200 --> 1:11:39.200]  and meanwhile they're persecuting the press they're persecuting the Tea Party because the Tea Party is the threat folks the Tea Party isn't perfect but that's why I've fully thrown in with the Tea Party and a move in the Republican Party to take it over
[1:11:39.200 --> 1:11:56.200]  because we're going to lose everything the Democrats run by the globalist have a plan of the third world to get the votes they need to checkmate using our republic and our voting system our democracy our limited democracy to checkmate in the country right now
[1:11:56.200 --> 1:12:19.200]  and who are they then attacking full scale info wars dot com I mean I've got CNN saying I'm behind the shooting basically I've got London Guardian I'm in the first paragraph
[1:12:19.200 --> 1:12:36.200]  another CNN Washington Post raw story just I mean thousands of articles ladies and gentlemen thousands you type Alex Jones into Google news click it there's thousands of articles today thousands attacking me
[1:12:36.200 --> 1:12:54.200]  and Darren McBrain was talking about his personal Facebook I'll try to get him on air and this buddy he's known forever he said his buddy he's known since college that his head lives its habitat is Obama's rear end to put it nicely he lives in Obama's
[1:12:54.200 --> 1:13:15.200]  rear end I mean I'm sorry to use that term it's only described in times like these and he he likes to taunt him every once in a while he believes he's powerful and successful because he loves Obama even as Obama betrays everybody and funds Al Qaeda and runs false flags and gets caught and runs Benghazi and runs fast and furious
[1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:34.200]  he's like man you better get out of him for wars real quick it's going down man yeah rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated I'm here we're bigger than ever but I don't want to be big I'd rather back the global stuff and this show the seed off into the sunset there
[1:13:34.200 --> 1:13:54.200]  still be plenty of issues to cover but it wouldn't be as hot and as powerful and as scary as it is this show is scary because we're a mirror for MSNBC and media matters in the White House to look at who you are you guys have gone through this toward now you've had multiple White House
[1:13:54.200 --> 1:14:14.200]  press secretaries Gibbs and Carney and others and a bunch of others every week I see a new clip where they get up on MSNBC or CNN and go yeah we lie to people what's the big deal we need to lie to you
[1:14:14.200 --> 1:14:27.200]  and that's what it is I'm a heretic I'm unbowed as that host said last hour from MSNBC we played the club what's her name again Alice Wagner she goes he is unbowed and she looks at the camera and puts her hand out
[1:14:27.200 --> 1:14:42.200]  and does a motion of me falling he's unbowed that's right which I don't believe known certified liars that say the Klan founded the NRA when it's the opposite I've heard that come out of your fat mouth
[1:14:42.200 --> 1:15:02.200]  I don't believe certified frauds who've been caught lying thousands of times I don't trust FBI snitches who help set up his own people and help create race riots and who was even is allowed to be anti-Semitic because he works for the
[1:15:02.200 --> 1:15:23.200]  NRA he's sick it's like it's like George Soros is a famous Nazi collaborator and should be in a prison in in in Hungary or Romania where he operated and instead his operations claim I'm anti-Semitic I mean I'm sick of it
[1:15:23.200 --> 1:15:38.200]  I was as involved in the Boston bombing as the man in the moon MSNBC that same witch Alex Wagner whatever her name is said that I'm done I wasn't involved in that bombing witch
[1:15:38.200 --> 1:15:56.200]  I say you people the people you work for are suspects and you're like oh my gosh he thinks we're suspects hey lady it's even in the BBC we forced it there that Al Qaeda from Saudi Arabia launched the chemical attacks on Assad's people to
[1:15:56.200 --> 1:16:12.200]  blame it on him you got caught sigh hers reported on it people know about false flags now lady we'd have to be morons not to think Obama could be behind this when they're running around with Holder last week going the tea party's about to attack we're launching our
[1:16:12.200 --> 1:16:27.200]  mass force this week the terrorism is everywhere we need the armored vehicles for the tea party oh my god look the tea party Alex Jones just killed two cops the next week two plus two equals four
[1:16:27.200 --> 1:16:48.200]  maybe these were unhinged devil worshipping pebs that were also mad at the government anti-establishment there is an allure to rebellion and sometimes it attracts bad people any revolution does but I am a counter revolutionary and I stand for what I have said
[1:16:48.200 --> 1:17:04.200]  I have said over and over and over again not because I'm scared of violence breaking out and getting blamed I'm committed to this but because violence is not the course we want to take because we've got a very good chance at fixing this peacefully because
[1:17:04.200 --> 1:17:20.200]  of checks and balances laid down by our forebears and fought for by our more recent ancestors and those living and that we can maybe turn all of this around they want a revolution they're geared up to
[1:17:20.200 --> 1:17:36.200]  conquer us paramilitarily they're trying to get the cops compartmentalized to follow this false script I'm blocking the script I'm hacking the script and saying police no veterans attack police they're saying there's going to be a war with veterans I
[1:17:36.200 --> 1:17:50.200]  thought the homeland street was for al-qaeda do you really just want mission creep do you really want to roll out a new war at bigger than the war on drugs against the patriot movement in an attempt to intimidate the liberty movement to shutting up and doing what you want politically
[1:17:50.200 --> 1:18:10.200]  that's not going to fly that dogs not going to hunt you don't want to be part of this please send a message you don't want to be marched up against the American people as the part of the red coats in 1776 part two and by the way the red coats were
[1:18:10.200 --> 1:18:30.200]  Thomas Jefferson compared to the Democrats the British red coats were altruistic Renaissance Angel cakes compared to the elite we've got running this country the red coat government would look good compared to this and George Washington went around
[1:18:30.200 --> 1:18:48.200]  putting death orders on people to kill because they were tyrants if you really want to get down to brass tax folks towards Washington ordered people to go into restaurants and bars and kill red coat officers
[1:18:48.200 --> 1:19:02.200]  but that's not what's happened those are red coats who knew what they were doing in an open war against the people we haven't gotten there yet we don't want that civil war to start ladies and gentlemen
[1:19:02.200 --> 1:19:22.200]  by the foreign occupiers we want to short circuit it and we want to stop it we do not want it so I'm proud and I'm honored to be in the position I'm in and I'm willing to take whatever happens to me in the process of them trying to demonize this broadcast

[1:24:21.200 --> 1:24:33.200]  Chris Matthews yeah CIA guys CIA on record Anderson Cooper does blue screen stuff when he's not even at Sandy Hook it's just amazing
[1:24:33.200 --> 1:24:45.200]  I mean CNN got caught this is famous you can that's on YouTube in the first Gulf War being in Atlanta on a blue screen saying that they were in Riyadh being nerve-gassed by Scott Attack
[1:24:45.200 --> 1:24:54.200]  hopping around in front of a blue screen didn't know their feed was going out live with the blue screen off
[1:24:54.200 --> 1:25:08.200]  I mean right there I'm just they've been caught lying so much if you have somebody in business that you've worked with you catch lying to you once you really lose confidence in them it kind of freaks you out
[1:25:08.200 --> 1:25:15.200]  then you catch them again again again three four times you'll never associate with them again
[1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:24.200]  but in modern America people just love to be suckered over and over again I mean I don't believe anything Hillary Clinton says I don't believe anything Obama says I don't believe anything John Boehner says
[1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:33.200]  I'm done with the blue blood Republicans and the Democrats and the whole establishment is coming out of the Tea Party good
[1:25:33.200 --> 1:25:44.200]  we don't need to get freaked out that we're being lectured by the White House run CNN MSNBC good it means we're having an effect good you're blaming me for tragedies good
[1:25:44.200 --> 1:25:50.200]  my job is to expose you I expect you to come after me
[1:25:50.200 --> 1:25:55.200]  most of you people work for the system because you cozy up to them as cowards
[1:25:55.200 --> 1:26:04.200]  and you're scared of the New World Order and you know how evil it is so you just decide to go along with it I've run into a lot of top people
[1:26:04.200 --> 1:26:16.200]  host of ABC Nightly News one of the host I'll just leave it at that MSNBC CNN people who privately at events and things said no we know a lot of what you're saying is true
[1:26:16.200 --> 1:26:22.200]  you know but the Republicans are bad too you know what do you want us to do vote for them I mean you know
[1:26:22.200 --> 1:26:27.200]  it's the same thing with the police we don't need to be each others enemies ladies and gentlemen
[1:26:27.200 --> 1:26:33.200]  most of the people that work for the system are just compartmentalized and operate under peer pressure
[1:26:33.200 --> 1:26:40.200]  we have a clip coming up where CNN says the Liberty Movement is more threatening than Al Qaeda that's up on info wars dot com
[1:26:40.200 --> 1:26:46.200]  this is the full conversion of homeland security on the American people
[1:26:46.200 --> 1:26:56.200]  and I know I keep saying that because it's happening Obama really is legalizing illegals outside of law and saying if you're poor and sick
[1:26:56.200 --> 1:27:05.200]  we'll pay for you and we've got a driver's license come here come to California and vote to take the guns
[1:27:05.200 --> 1:27:12.200]  they've got a plan to turn Texas blue battlefield Texas where they they've been caught on video we've played the clips
[1:27:12.200 --> 1:27:24.200]  the Democratic Party saying we're going to take over we're gonna have the illegals vote we're gonna take the guns everything all we need is 5 million illegals to come here
[1:27:24.200 --> 1:27:31.200]  they get 3 or 4 they say 5 that's more than they need they get about 3 million illegal voters who almost all pull the lever for Democrats
[1:27:31.200 --> 1:27:40.200]  it's over folks they will take our guns and they will line up the armored vehicles in a phalanx and come just like that state judge
[1:27:40.200 --> 1:27:48.200]  county judge you know head of the county it's like the mayor was it Lubbock that was Lubbock was on
[1:27:48.200 --> 1:27:53.200]  remember last year he got all that trouble but he didn't get in trouble he got elected to landslide but the media said he was in trouble
[1:27:53.200 --> 1:28:00.200]  he came out he said listen they're gonna stage stuff I don't know what when Obama gets reelected he's not gonna leave office by the end
[1:28:00.200 --> 1:28:09.200]  this is what he said not me and when they come to try to confiscate the guns I'm not gonna be part of it and when they show up with those armored vehicles
[1:28:09.200 --> 1:28:19.200]  I'm gonna need more deputies and we're gonna need to go ahead and get some of those federal armored vehicles because I'm not gonna turn the guns in and we're not gonna have them in this county
[1:28:19.200 --> 1:28:28.200]  and I thought man that guy's even more tough than I am I mean but he's a reality based guy he got the police chief sitting right next to him
[1:28:28.200 --> 1:28:37.200]  gravely there it is Texas judge warrants Obama reelection lead to civil war because it's true folks why do you think that county judge said that over a major city
[1:28:37.200 --> 1:28:51.200]  man that's a big city yeah love it why do you think he said that judge Tom head because folks the feds are coming to all the cities and saying get ready for this to find out who's gonna go along with it
[1:28:51.200 --> 1:29:04.200]  that's one thing waking up the police and military is they're being prepared for this they're in the meetings they're battle training they're battle training to take the guns folks a civil war will break out
[1:29:04.200 --> 1:29:16.200]  do you understand and they're gonna need a trigger so I said look for blowing up police stations shooting police and restaurants shooting them in their cars blaming it on us
[1:29:16.200 --> 1:29:25.200]  but they've been hyping it so much mentally ill people may get it in their head and go do it so I'm saying don't do it don't do it don't do it every day
[1:29:25.200 --> 1:29:34.200]  and then somebody does it and I'm being blamed man what does that tell you they're getting ready to drop the hammer
[1:29:34.200 --> 1:29:40.200]  we've been trying to stop it forever when they gonna drop the hammer out when they gonna drop the hammer out when they gonna drop the hammer out

[1:33:31.200 --> 1:33:39.200]  public enemy number one if the public so much a foreign mega bankers you Genesis funding real Nazis
[1:33:39.200 --> 1:33:48.200]  overthrowing Ukraine funding real al-Qaeda out of many areas in Africa to invade their neighbors
[1:33:48.200 --> 1:33:53.200]  like in the case of Somalia into Kenya
[1:33:53.200 --> 1:33:58.200]  Africa you name it are in the business of a literally arming al-Qaeda
[1:33:58.200 --> 1:34:06.200]  and then I'm a conspiracy theorist because I say the globalist may be involved in Las Vegas false flag
[1:34:06.200 --> 1:34:12.200]  when they've been caught staging shootings before and it's in U.S. government documents like Northwood's
[1:34:12.200 --> 1:34:19.200]  and they stand to gain from it of course I think the federal government criminal elements of it are prime suspects
[1:34:19.200 --> 1:34:30.200]  in every major event and I stand by those statements I am unbowed as MSNBC said I want to play some clips
[1:34:30.200 --> 1:34:35.200]  and then go to your phone calls right through into the next hour I want to hear specifically on this issue
[1:34:35.200 --> 1:34:44.200]  and this ties into the open borders I mean it's federal law that Obama can't be doing what he's doing on
[1:34:44.200 --> 1:34:52.200]  more than 20 fronts I mean they are legalizing felons they are releasing felons with not even having a trial
[1:34:52.200 --> 1:35:01.200]  arsonist rapist child molesters 60 plus thousand of them in just the last month they are have hundreds of thousands
[1:35:01.200 --> 1:35:07.200]  of kids being flown in and just dumped off at airports filling military bases with them and Obama says bring more
[1:35:07.200 --> 1:35:14.200]  we'll get them lawyers we'll let you stay here and then fencing them out to foster homes that are then federally
[1:35:14.200 --> 1:35:22.200]  and state paid I mean the country is being bankrupted purposefully and we've known the globalist run by the
[1:35:22.200 --> 1:35:27.200]  offshore globalist and and and and Obama's their front man we've known they want to wreck the country
[1:35:27.200 --> 1:35:33.200]  and make us dependent on them but it's one thing to know they want it it's another thing to see it happening
[1:35:33.200 --> 1:35:39.200]  it's an you know one thing to know a family member sick it's nothing to see them take their last breath and die
[1:35:39.200 --> 1:35:46.200]  and they're dead laying there in the bed in front of you and we're watching the slow motion slitting of this
[1:35:46.200 --> 1:35:51.200]  country's throat right now and this country's already might be too far gone is what I'm trying to say
[1:35:51.200 --> 1:35:59.200]  and now they are just stabbing us with an ice pick with wanton abandon as fast as they can to make sure the
[1:35:59.200 --> 1:36:05.200]  job's been done and it is unbelievable to watch and then it's even crazier as an individual can you imagine
[1:36:05.200 --> 1:36:11.200]  being me and I just bring this up so you understand where my head's at where I study these people I know what
[1:36:11.200 --> 1:36:17.200]  criminal liars they are I'm called a conspiracy theorist because I don't believe known criminal liars
[1:36:17.200 --> 1:36:25.200]  and there's the good news of why are they so afraid of this broadcast and the information we put out our
[1:36:25.200 --> 1:36:32.200]  worldview is so close to reality doesn't mean we don't see through rose color darkly's doesn't mean we're not
[1:36:32.200 --> 1:36:40.200]  perfect you know we certainly have problems but when you've got thousands of publications opening fire on you
[1:36:40.200 --> 1:36:49.200]  and every major TV news channel that's White House run state run media attacking you on the hour it's
[1:36:49.200 --> 1:36:55.200]  because they want the average weak minded person that still watches them to see that and to be told
[1:36:55.200 --> 1:37:03.200]  like they're a two year old you don't go near this you don't listen to this it's racist if you own guns
[1:37:03.200 --> 1:37:10.200]  the NRA founded the Klan it's racist if you don't like Obamacare it's racist if you don't like prison food in the
[1:37:10.200 --> 1:37:16.200]  schools it's racist if you have your own thoughts and it's terrorism if you talk about private property
[1:37:16.200 --> 1:37:22.200]  and don't like MSNBC saying your kids belong to the state they came out lastly before all this happened
[1:37:22.200 --> 1:37:29.200]  the Justice Department we had an article on info wars dot com about it and John P. Eric Holder I was
[1:37:29.200 --> 1:37:36.200]  like a John P. Holder in the eco science guy why science are the attorney general with all his scandals
[1:37:36.200 --> 1:37:42.200]  and lies and corruption just like Harry Reid still up there it's like having Satan running the judiciary
[1:37:42.200 --> 1:37:50.200]  or the prosecution I can't even hardly talk at this point it's just when I think about all the bad stuff
[1:37:50.200 --> 1:37:59.200]  they've done how openly bad they are and then I have the attention of these wicked ones and it's because
[1:37:59.200 --> 1:38:06.200]  we know who they are and we are willing to call them out and other people won't go all the way and
[1:38:06.200 --> 1:38:12.200]  they're scared to death folks and they said this that if what I'm saying gets picked up by other people
[1:38:12.200 --> 1:38:22.200]  and looked into it's over because naked in the living room is the ten thousand pound monster stinking
[1:38:22.200 --> 1:38:30.200]  to high heaven covered in the blood of innocence wiping its mouth with dead babies like handkerchiefs
[1:38:30.200 --> 1:38:38.200]  sitting in a pile of victims committing all these crimes and frauds and lies ripping the country apart
[1:38:38.200 --> 1:38:45.200]  imagine America like a control room with dials and wheels and diodes and it's like an eighty thousand pound
[1:38:45.200 --> 1:38:52.200]  goblin running through with a club just smashing everything and I'm just standing here going that's a big
[1:38:52.200 --> 1:38:58.200]  horrible monster smashing everything historically it's tyranny it's wrecking the country bad and they're like
[1:38:58.200 --> 1:39:05.200]  that's a terrorist any problems in the country it's his fault well they're gonna be a backlash real or
[1:39:05.200 --> 1:39:11.200]  manufactured against all this and it's not gonna be pretty but it's not my fault that I'm pointing out the
[1:39:11.200 --> 1:39:22.200]  Emperor's butt naked so in a microcosm this radio show and what we're talking about here needs to be
[1:39:22.200 --> 1:39:29.200]  studied and looked at because we got clips of Harry Reid on the Senate floor yesterday and today saying
[1:39:29.200 --> 1:39:33.200]  we need to pass laws restricting free speech and looking into people that criticize the government
[1:39:33.200 --> 1:39:43.200]  because they may be mass shooters when the mass shootings are flat and you say well they're not
[1:39:43.200 --> 1:39:48.200]  gonna get the legislation passed oh when they run a Psyop and blow up a public school full of
[1:39:48.200 --> 1:39:54.200]  kindergartners and blaming on people and you know they find a stack of Alex Jones magazines in the back
[1:39:54.200 --> 1:40:03.200]  guys car how that works is I walk out of my house and I get shot and they say oh someone mad at him did
[1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:11.200]  it and it'll really be the FBI or it'll be a hired contractor and they'll do it right when the terror
[1:40:11.200 --> 1:40:17.200]  attack comes right when everybody's mad it'll be oh look because I studied how they kill people in
[1:40:17.200 --> 1:40:21.200]  third world countries when they do a takeover like this there's always talk show host or writers or
[1:40:21.200 --> 1:40:25.200]  people that have criticized them that have the people's ear folk hero types they've got to kill
[1:40:25.200 --> 1:40:30.200]  they'll kill them right when they stage the big false flag and then they're gonna come after everybody
[1:40:30.200 --> 1:40:35.200]  else they're gonna come after all the people at Breitbart that are so scared they're gonna come after
[1:40:35.200 --> 1:40:43.200]  Glenn Beck I mean Glenn you you don't think just because you threw me on the bus last month and
[1:40:43.200 --> 1:40:47.200]  did all that they're gonna leave you alone I told you then they're gonna stage stuff and they're
[1:40:47.200 --> 1:40:53.200]  gonna come after you buddy they they dislike you just as much as they dislike me don't think just
[1:40:53.200 --> 1:40:57.200]  because you've gone milk toast on people and are backpedaling right now they're not gonna nail you to
[1:40:57.200 --> 1:41:03.200]  the wall if they win I'm gonna quote Benjamin Franklin to you the most famous inventor in world
[1:41:03.200 --> 1:41:12.200]  history who invented hundreds of inventions used today in your house I'm gonna quote probably one of
[1:41:12.200 --> 1:41:17.200]  the smartest people that ever lived Benjamin Franklin we will hang together or we will hang
[1:41:17.200 --> 1:41:25.200]  separate buddy and that goes for everybody out there you're not gonna run up a flag to these
[1:41:25.200 --> 1:41:31.200]  people a white flag and they're gonna come patch on the head they're never going to stop you may be
[1:41:31.200 --> 1:41:36.200]  the most hardcore Obama liberal supporter now they're getting a police state ready for when they bring
[1:41:36.200 --> 1:41:42.200]  this country into a full-bore depression they're gonna take everything we've got our way of life is
[1:41:42.200 --> 1:41:47.200]  gonna be over when they pop this final bubble and they want it set where you're a terrorist if you
[1:41:47.200 --> 1:41:52.200]  criticize anything and they've got the police look at the zero hedge article up on info wars.com
[1:41:52.200 --> 1:42:00.200]  with Department of Defense graphs by them of the arms build up the Department of Defense keeps track
[1:42:00.200 --> 1:42:10.200]  of it as the tens of thousands of armored vehicles tanks fully auto machine guns 50 caliber rifles
[1:42:10.200 --> 1:42:17.200]  and buddy they're training with targets homeland security provided of children called no hesitation
[1:42:17.200 --> 1:42:28.200]  military equipment for local police and look at that just the last year 533 aircraft 93,000 plus fully
[1:42:28.200 --> 1:42:43.200]  auto with grenade launchers 44,000 plus pieces of night vision m-raps just it's thousands a year
[1:42:43.200 --> 1:42:48.200]  this is just in the last few months and it and it goes through graph after graph of what's being
[1:42:48.200 --> 1:42:59.200]  passed that's a very low number in this current zero hedge article I mean it is full on war training
[1:42:59.200 --> 1:43:11.200]  with no war against the police the military going on but see now it starts and again 7 million
[1:43:11.200 --> 1:43:16.200]  people I forget which university you can look up I think the headlines you know researcher
[1:43:16.200 --> 1:43:23.200]  study 7 million died as a result of great depression and it says from malnutrition or flat out starvation
[1:43:23.200 --> 1:43:33.200]  in the 10 years the Great Depression 1929 to 1939 that's the official Great Depression 7 million
[1:43:33.200 --> 1:43:40.200]  people when 90% were self-sufficient and lived on farms 10% were urban we're now flip the numbers
[1:43:40.200 --> 1:43:48.200]  correctly to 90% urban and not self-sufficient 10% rural half of them self-sufficient we've gone from
[1:43:48.200 --> 1:43:56.200]  5% self-sufficient today when it was 90% I mean do you realize the level of the powder keg
[1:43:56.200 --> 1:44:03.200]  we're sitting on and they're going to throw a few thousand police in major cities with a few dozen
[1:44:03.200 --> 1:44:11.200]  vehicles against howling crazy mobs and you've got enough people that have done murder training on all
[1:44:11.200 --> 1:44:15.200]  the shoot them up games the Pentagon invented I'm not demonizing the games it's just it's a murder simulator
[1:44:15.200 --> 1:44:20.200]  it's a killing simulator you got people on drugs whacked out with murder simulators that are in love
[1:44:20.200 --> 1:44:26.200]  with death and all the death fetishes that are just everywhere I mean death fetishes I mean I see
[1:44:26.200 --> 1:44:31.200]  women all the time completely gorgeous into death into destruction you know murder you know being
[1:44:31.200 --> 1:44:38.200]  slapped around you name and I mean that's that's the hot stuff out there there's there's a depression
[1:44:38.200 --> 1:44:43.200]  in this country folks I'm not going to be running around like George Washington with a gun in my hand
[1:44:43.200 --> 1:44:49.200]  leading some war against cannon fodder police I'm going to be keeping my butt out of circulation
[1:44:49.200 --> 1:44:55.200]  that's how you win this war is not having to kill anybody but they're going to make the cops put
[1:44:55.200 --> 1:45:01.200]  people's back up against the wall man this is a disaster this is a disaster if the moral Christian
[1:45:01.200 --> 1:45:10.200]  hard-working people of the 20s 7 million died you see the grapes are rough folks which is a
[1:45:10.200 --> 1:45:16.200]  communist movie has a bad moral but it's very accurate about what it was like for people being
[1:45:16.200 --> 1:45:22.200]  used by corrupt corporate systems but see what the grapes are rough doesn't tell you the corrupt
[1:45:22.200 --> 1:45:28.200]  corporations that you see in the grapes of wrath they run the government and they run the socialism
[1:45:28.200 --> 1:45:33.200]  you go out of the corporate fraud into a communist fraud run by the corporates who are going to sit
[1:45:33.200 --> 1:45:39.200]  it out in Switzerland and I'm gonna tell you something I would move to northern Europe or I would
[1:45:39.200 --> 1:45:47.200]  move to Switzerland if you had the money if you're not going to fight this right now I would get
[1:45:47.200 --> 1:45:54.200]  out of dodge right now and that's what the elite of all done most of the rich Jews are leaving
[1:45:54.200 --> 1:46:01.200]  Israel what do you think that means means world war ladies and gentlemen the Middle East
[1:46:01.200 --> 1:46:06.200]  gonna blow up I don't know when but the billionaire Jews every one of them is left they've been
[1:46:06.200 --> 1:46:13.200]  criticized by Israel for doing it why are they leaving because they know something folks they know
[1:46:13.200 --> 1:46:23.200]  something and the leader leaving the US I told you five years ago about a billionaire defense
[1:46:23.200 --> 1:46:29.200]  contractor I ran into who was a listener and I was told that you're gonna get so big you're not
[1:46:29.200 --> 1:46:33.200]  gonna believe it I told the story five years ago I said why they should because everything
[1:46:33.200 --> 1:46:37.200]  you're saying is dead on and more I'm getting out of the United States I said what are you talking
[1:46:37.200 --> 1:46:44.200]  about and this person works with special forces a lot of the people and owned a helicopter company
[1:46:44.200 --> 1:46:56.200]  some other stuff looked at me and said you're dead on I said what's gonna happen and they said
[1:46:56.200 --> 1:47:10.200]  the US will not be here and I said what does that mean just what I just said I don't know what that
[1:47:10.200 --> 1:47:19.200]  means but now I'm starting an idea they square off the Christian gun owners and veterans against
[1:47:19.200 --> 1:47:24.200]  the military and police it is gonna look like something the world has never seen the Vietnamese
[1:47:24.200 --> 1:47:32.200]  killed 58,000 US troops injured over 300,000 the entire US military with the British couldn't
[1:47:32.200 --> 1:47:40.200]  hold Baghdad folks I have no desire to kick the military's butt or to see the police get their
[1:47:40.200 --> 1:47:45.200]  butt kicked because we're all getting our butt kicked we're all playing a game of the globalists
[1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:50.200]  we're all fools do I need to play that's why I described the Civil War and the police getting
[1:47:50.200 --> 1:47:56.200]  shot about six or seven times I played the from Russia would love the first James Bond movie
[1:47:56.200 --> 1:48:03.200]  with the two simies fighting fish and I played the clip probably five six times last few months
[1:48:03.200 --> 1:48:11.200]  where it leads through all that and explains how the two fish basically weaken and kill each other
[1:48:11.200 --> 1:48:15.200]  or one fish is dead the other's weakened then the other comes in and kills the last one left
[1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:21.200]  that's exactly what this is and they've got a bunch of warrior types who are ready to go to war
[1:48:21.200 --> 1:48:32.200]  with the American people and I guess if we do this we deserve it I mean America is the blame
[1:48:32.200 --> 1:48:40.200]  for this the globalists are more to blame in the final equation but we we said you know what
[1:48:40.200 --> 1:48:45.200]  fifty three million babies aren't human go ahead and kill them in fact kill them once they're born
[1:48:45.200 --> 1:48:50.200]  kill them updates three they're now saying in the journal of bioethics and places
[1:48:50.200 --> 1:48:55.200]  let's burn babies and have no respect for human life to heat the hospitals in the US and England
[1:48:55.200 --> 1:49:05.200]  yeah let's cross humans with monkeys yeah let's cross dogs with jellyfish we don't care
[1:49:05.200 --> 1:49:13.200]  and so if you don't think fifty three million babies were humans Bill Gates doesn't think you're a human
[1:49:13.200 --> 1:49:19.200]  and if we let them start a civil war and the cops really want to have a war with the American people
[1:49:19.200 --> 1:49:25.200]  while the country's got it I mean if you go along with it you buy the sigh up I guess we deserve it
[1:49:25.200 --> 1:49:29.200]  and I guess I'm a been evil as well I haven't worked hard enough to fight this and I was involved
[1:49:29.200 --> 1:49:35.200]  in bad stuff when I was young not really bad stuff for the average person but things I'm guilty of
[1:49:35.200 --> 1:49:40.200]  maybe I deserve what's coming to me I kind of take solace in that you know what maybe it's just judgment
[1:49:40.200 --> 1:49:44.200]  at the end of the day and I'm going to tell MSNBC something the rest of them it's not just going to be
[1:49:44.200 --> 1:49:49.200]  the cops and the patriots that get judged in this whole deal it's going to be you too every one of you
[1:49:49.200 --> 1:49:54.200]  when this is all over and in this process you are the ones that are going to pay for what you're part of
[1:49:54.200 --> 1:49:59.200]  because you're consciously throwing gasoline on the fire of this while I'm trying to stop it
[1:49:59.200 --> 1:50:03.200]  and then trying to blame me let's go out to break with the James Bond clip then I'll come back
[1:50:03.200 --> 1:50:06.200]  give the number out here it is

[1:50:23.200 --> 1:50:29.200]  and he waits
[1:50:29.200 --> 1:50:35.200]  waits until the survivor is so exhausted that he cannot defend himself
[1:50:35.200 --> 1:50:40.200]  and then like specter he strikes
[1:50:40.200 --> 1:50:43.200]  I find the pattern amusing
[1:50:43.200 --> 1:50:49.200]  our organization did not arrange for you to come over from the Russians just for amusement number three
[1:50:49.200 --> 1:50:55.200]  and what was the plan to get NATO and the Russians to kill each other show a criminal group infiltrated
[1:50:55.200 --> 1:51:21.200]  both governments to make profit off of it and who wrote the book

[1:52:11.200 --> 1:52:14.200]  I was raised as a girl scout and their motto was to be prepared
[1:52:14.200 --> 1:52:20.200]  food for patriots was an opportunity for me to be able to put some things aside
[1:52:20.200 --> 1:52:24.200]  I said well this is a product worth having seen as it's so good
[1:52:24.200 --> 1:52:29.200]  like the pricing for what I got I like the containers they were shipped in

[1:54:14.200 --> 1:54:18.200]  it seems apparent that our citizens are staying off the streets
[1:54:18.200 --> 1:54:22.200]  which may make scoring particularly difficult
[1:54:22.200 --> 1:54:27.200]  even with this year's rule changes to recap those revisions
[1:54:27.200 --> 1:54:33.200]  women are still worth 10 points more than men at all age brackets
[1:54:33.200 --> 1:54:40.200]  but teenagers now rack up 40 points and toddlers under 12

[1:55:31.200 --> 1:55:34.200]  going in for the kill
[1:55:34.200 --> 1:55:39.200]  I haven't played any of the clips Al Sharpton attacking me Chris Matthews attacking me
[1:55:39.200 --> 1:55:44.200]  CNN saying a liberty movement more threatening than Al Qaeda I mean it's all scripted
[1:55:44.200 --> 1:55:47.200]  all happening just like I said it would be scripted
[1:55:47.200 --> 1:55:50.200]  remember back six years ago and I was saying this no one was saying this
[1:55:50.200 --> 1:55:54.200]  you're seeing it happen we got their internal memos
[1:55:54.200 --> 1:56:00.200]  and they weren't training the cops secretly for this because they weren't going to have it happen
[1:56:00.200 --> 1:56:04.200]  homeland security was always set up for us ladies and gentlemen
[1:56:04.200 --> 1:56:13.200]  Islamic terrorism is real radical Islamic terrorism but the globalist fund it and allow it
[1:56:13.200 --> 1:56:18.200]  and they used it to build up the police state now it's pointed at the American people
[1:56:18.200 --> 1:56:22.200]  now I've got to guess pop it in for like 10 minutes the next hour the young man that confronted

[1:56:42.200 --> 1:56:46.200]  press media won't do it we have to be citizen journalist
[1:56:46.200 --> 1:56:50.200]  and who knows they'll say you're behind terrorism because you ask about the NSA
[1:56:50.200 --> 1:56:54.200]  that's how we're going to beat them so what it doesn't work anymore when they call you racist
[1:56:54.200 --> 1:56:59.200]  if you don't like Obama
[1:56:59.200 --> 1:57:03.200]  they don't have the power anymore people don't watch and listen to them

[2:01:13.200 --> 2:01:15.200]  and got away with being a Nazi collaborator
[2:01:15.200 --> 2:01:17.200]  I guess
[2:01:17.200 --> 2:01:20.200]  he went on 60 minutes and admitted that he collaborated with the Nazis
[2:01:20.200 --> 2:01:22.200]  and said he did what he had to do
[2:01:22.200 --> 2:01:24.200]  I mean I just
[2:01:26.200 --> 2:01:28.200]  maybe he is invincible
[2:01:30.200 --> 2:01:32.200]  I mean he could overthrow a half dozen European countries

[2:01:55.200 --> 2:01:58.200]  I just can't believe what a weird world it is
[2:01:59.200 --> 2:02:02.200]  that both my grandfathers fought the Nazis
[2:02:02.200 --> 2:02:04.200]  and they lionized it
[2:02:04.200 --> 2:02:06.200]  and built it all up as the most epic war of history
[2:02:06.200 --> 2:02:09.200]  and then a top Nazi collaborator in his region
[2:02:09.200 --> 2:02:11.200]  a true rat mole

[2:02:55.200 --> 2:02:57.200]  and say chin up Alex we know you're good
[2:02:57.200 --> 2:02:59.200]  but man you know blah blah blah
[2:02:59.200 --> 2:03:01.200]  you're in a lot of trouble
[2:03:01.200 --> 2:03:03.200]  we're in a lot of trouble
[2:03:03.200 --> 2:03:05.200]  I'm not in a lot of trouble
[2:03:05.200 --> 2:03:08.200]  I chose to fight these people
[2:03:08.200 --> 2:03:11.200]  I expect to be attacked
[2:03:13.200 --> 2:03:16.200]  what does it say that some stuttering Texan
[2:03:16.200 --> 2:03:18.200]  who knows what's going on
[2:03:18.200 --> 2:03:21.200]  could create a system with no college education
[2:03:21.200 --> 2:03:25.200]  to oppose the puppet system of the main global empire
[2:03:28.200 --> 2:03:31.200]  that Matt Drudge with no formal education
[2:03:31.200 --> 2:03:35.200]  could have the dominant news site in the world
[2:03:35.200 --> 2:03:40.200]  it's only because we're just normal people
[2:03:40.200 --> 2:03:42.200]  world net dailies run by an official journalist
[2:03:42.200 --> 2:03:44.200]  he ran some of the biggest newspapers in the country
[2:03:44.200 --> 2:03:46.200]  and pioneer web journalism
[2:03:46.200 --> 2:03:48.200]  wanted the first to do it on the White House enemies list
[2:03:48.200 --> 2:03:51.200]  in the early 90s how they wanted to shut down
[2:03:51.200 --> 2:03:53.200]  Joseph Farah because they said if this is allowed to grow
[2:03:53.200 --> 2:03:56.200]  it will allow choice in ideas with the public
[2:03:56.200 --> 2:03:57.200]  read the memo
[2:03:57.200 --> 2:04:00.200]  my god sounds like something Kim Jong-un would write
[2:04:00.200 --> 2:04:02.200]  if we let Joseph Farah do this
[2:04:02.200 --> 2:04:04.200]  others might pick it up
[2:04:04.200 --> 2:04:05.200]  and there might be choice
[2:04:05.200 --> 2:04:07.200]  and then we won't control reality
[2:04:07.200 --> 2:04:09.200]  that's right Bill Clinton
[2:04:11.200 --> 2:04:13.200]  the money I have to fund my operation
[2:04:13.200 --> 2:04:15.200]  was fairly earned with good products
[2:04:15.200 --> 2:04:16.200]  no government money
[2:04:16.200 --> 2:04:18.200]  Bill Clinton admittedly
[2:04:18.200 --> 2:04:20.200]  I saw the numbers a few months ago
[2:04:20.200 --> 2:04:22.200]  more than half the tens of millions he raises a year
[2:04:22.200 --> 2:04:25.200]  with his charity off black kids
[2:04:25.200 --> 2:04:29.200]  goes for his fleet of private jets
[2:04:29.200 --> 2:04:32.200]  and foundation homes he lives in
[2:04:32.200 --> 2:04:35.200]  all over the world
[2:04:35.200 --> 2:04:40.200]  something like 25 million a year goes to it
[2:04:40.200 --> 2:04:42.200]  but he says he likes black people
[2:04:42.200 --> 2:04:44.200]  so they worship him
[2:04:44.200 --> 2:04:47.200]  I mean it's just sick
[2:04:47.200 --> 2:04:49.200]  you don't control me Bill Clinton
[2:04:49.200 --> 2:04:50.200]  you piece of crap
[2:04:50.200 --> 2:04:52.200]  and you never will you son of a bitch
[2:04:52.200 --> 2:04:53.200]  excuse me
[2:04:53.200 --> 2:04:54.200]  I'm sorry folks
[2:04:54.200 --> 2:04:59.200]  well they're right back
[2:05:24.200 --> 2:05:26.200]  the ammunition is information
[2:05:26.200 --> 2:05:27.200]  and the soldiers are you

[2:05:29.200 --> 2:05:31.200]  from passive listener to active participant
[2:05:31.200 --> 2:05:34.200]  we from Scotland have had our skin in this game
[2:05:34.200 --> 2:05:36.200]  for the greater part of the last thousand years
[2:05:36.200 --> 2:05:37.200]  and I'm still fighting
[2:05:37.200 --> 2:05:39.200]  if we don't all stand up right now
[2:05:39.200 --> 2:05:40.200]  we're gonna lose everything
[2:05:40.200 --> 2:05:42.200]  the info war is worldwide

[2:05:58.200 --> 2:06:00.200]  the truth will set them free
[2:06:00.200 --> 2:06:01.200]  I don't know what it is
[2:06:01.200 --> 2:06:03.200]  Ralph just won't pay any attention to me
[2:06:03.200 --> 2:06:04.200]  when he comes home from work
[2:06:04.200 --> 2:06:06.200]  all he ever does is play video games
[2:06:06.200 --> 2:06:07.200]  and go to sleep
[2:06:07.200 --> 2:06:09.200]  it's like I don't even exist

[2:06:12.200 --> 2:06:14.200]  if the answer to this question is yes

[2:06:20.200 --> 2:06:22.200]  many of these toxic additives
[2:06:22.200 --> 2:06:23.200]  are deliberately engineered
[2:06:23.200 --> 2:06:25.200]  to attack and weaken human masculinity
[2:06:25.200 --> 2:06:28.200]  it's part of the eugenics population control movement

[2:08:19.200 --> 2:08:22.200]  Alex Jones
[2:08:25.200 --> 2:08:27.200]  alright we're going to open the phone system up

[2:08:32.200 --> 2:08:35.200]  after we talk to this guest
[2:08:35.200 --> 2:08:38.200]  they're clearly starting a civil war
[2:08:38.200 --> 2:08:40.200]  they're clearly saying the new terror threat
[2:08:40.200 --> 2:08:43.200]  on CNN that club's coming up in a moment
[2:08:43.200 --> 2:08:45.200]  is the bigger threat than Al Qaeda
[2:08:45.200 --> 2:08:47.200]  that's the official internal talking point
[2:08:47.200 --> 2:08:49.200]  that we got six years ago
[2:08:49.200 --> 2:08:51.200]  from state police federal marshals and FBI
[2:08:51.200 --> 2:08:53.200]  in trifecta and I called the phone numbers
[2:08:53.200 --> 2:08:55.200]  the FBI got very threatening
[2:08:55.200 --> 2:08:57.200]  that I had those documents
[2:08:57.200 --> 2:08:59.200]  told me I wasn't supposed to have them
[2:08:59.200 --> 2:09:01.200]  it became national news
[2:09:01.200 --> 2:09:03.200]  you know the rest of the story
[2:09:05.200 --> 2:09:07.200]  they are now going operational with this
[2:09:07.200 --> 2:09:09.200]  and that means they're going to stage stuff
[2:09:09.200 --> 2:09:11.200]  when they roll it out and start announcing
[2:09:11.200 --> 2:09:13.200]  there'll be armored vehicles for your safety
[2:09:13.200 --> 2:09:15.200]  and the tea party are terrorists
[2:09:15.200 --> 2:09:17.200]  I mean they're telling the military
[2:09:17.200 --> 2:09:19.200]  that in official manuals
[2:09:19.200 --> 2:09:21.200]  that means
[2:09:21.200 --> 2:09:23.200]  they're getting ready to go operational
[2:09:25.200 --> 2:09:27.200]  but I got to say something to them
[2:09:27.200 --> 2:09:29.200]  we're going to our guest
[2:09:29.200 --> 2:09:31.200]  I'm going to give the number up
[2:09:31.200 --> 2:09:33.200]  what do they think it does
[2:09:33.200 --> 2:09:35.200]  to the military and the police
[2:09:35.200 --> 2:09:37.200]  when we warned them about this for years beforehand
[2:09:37.200 --> 2:09:39.200]  and then they get called in a briefing room
[2:09:39.200 --> 2:09:41.200]  and told this
[2:09:41.200 --> 2:09:43.200]  see if we had just sat around
[2:09:43.200 --> 2:09:45.200]  and waited until they started
[2:09:45.200 --> 2:09:47.200]  the mass shootings and the bombings and things
[2:09:47.200 --> 2:09:49.200]  staging them
[2:09:49.200 --> 2:09:51.200]  and then
[2:09:51.200 --> 2:09:53.200]  let them
[2:09:53.200 --> 2:09:55.200]  march in and tell the cops they might have bought it
[2:09:55.200 --> 2:09:57.200]  because this stuff was already happening
[2:09:57.200 --> 2:09:59.200]  but see we told them it was coming
[2:09:59.200 --> 2:10:01.200]  we told the cops that they were going to be told this
[2:10:01.200 --> 2:10:03.200]  before they were told it and then we told them
[2:10:03.200 --> 2:10:05.200]  notice none of this is happening
[2:10:05.200 --> 2:10:07.200]  but it will right after they announce
[2:10:07.200 --> 2:10:09.200]  the domestic homegrown terrorist
[2:10:09.200 --> 2:10:11.200]  task forces
[2:10:11.200 --> 2:10:13.200]  and then that was announced last week
[2:10:13.200 --> 2:10:15.200]  and then now this began
[2:10:15.200 --> 2:10:17.200]  now it could be a coincidence
[2:10:17.200 --> 2:10:19.200]  or it could be all the hype now
[2:10:19.200 --> 2:10:21.200]  in the public rollout
[2:10:21.200 --> 2:10:23.200]  that domestic groups are going to start terror attacks
[2:10:23.200 --> 2:10:25.200]  that weak-minded, crazy people
[2:10:25.200 --> 2:10:27.200]  in the culture of death
[2:10:27.200 --> 2:10:29.200]  who glommed on to the tea party
[2:10:29.200 --> 2:10:31.200]  and they were thrown off the Bundy Ranch
[2:10:31.200 --> 2:10:33.200]  I remember seeing him on TV
[2:10:35.200 --> 2:10:37.200]  and
[2:10:37.200 --> 2:10:39.200]  that
[2:10:39.200 --> 2:10:41.200]  that guy sounds like a provocateur
[2:10:41.200 --> 2:10:43.200]  or might have just been mentally ill
[2:10:43.200 --> 2:10:45.200]  might be real
[2:10:45.200 --> 2:10:47.200]  and the media will say
[2:10:47.200 --> 2:10:49.200]  I'm backing off saying it's absolutely
[2:10:49.200 --> 2:10:51.200]  staged I said at the rest
[2:10:51.200 --> 2:10:53.200]  of the clip that CNN and MSNBC didn't play
[2:10:53.200 --> 2:10:55.200]  that it's the sick culture produced it
[2:10:55.200 --> 2:10:57.200]  one way or another it's artificial
[2:10:57.200 --> 2:10:59.200]  and I don't take the blame
[2:10:59.200 --> 2:11:01.200]  for it when I'm trying to stop it
[2:11:01.200 --> 2:11:03.200]  now joining us here's the toll free number
[2:11:03.200 --> 2:11:05.200]  800
[2:11:05.200 --> 2:11:07.200]  2599231
[2:11:07.200 --> 2:11:09.200]  8002599231
[2:11:11.200 --> 2:11:13.200]  but let's say you're an MSNBC
[2:11:13.200 --> 2:11:15.200]  or CNN viewer
[2:11:15.200 --> 2:11:17.200]  and you really think I'm evil and you're one of these people
[2:11:17.200 --> 2:11:19.200]  I see the minority on InfoWars.com
[2:11:19.200 --> 2:11:21.200]  or PrismPlanet.com
[2:11:21.200 --> 2:11:23.200]  that
[2:11:23.200 --> 2:11:25.200]  really think I'm to blame for all this
[2:11:25.200 --> 2:11:27.200]  I'm creating the paranoia about the corrupt government
[2:11:27.200 --> 2:11:29.200]  there's no NSA illegal spying
[2:11:29.200 --> 2:11:31.200]  Obamacare is a great deal
[2:11:31.200 --> 2:11:33.200]  they're not shutting down our power plants
[2:11:33.200 --> 2:11:35.200]  it's not funding al-Qaeda overseas even though it's admitted
[2:11:35.200 --> 2:11:37.200]  there are no drones
[2:11:37.200 --> 2:11:39.200]  there are no billions of bullets there are no armored vehicles
[2:11:39.200 --> 2:11:41.200]  there is no police state
[2:11:41.200 --> 2:11:43.200]  there are no derivatives there is no
[2:11:43.200 --> 2:11:45.200]  new world order there's not a global government
[2:11:45.200 --> 2:11:47.200]  being built the government's not funding
[2:11:47.200 --> 2:11:49.200]  the overthrow of Ukraine with Nazis
[2:11:49.200 --> 2:11:51.200]  everything's fine I'm evil
[2:11:51.200 --> 2:11:53.200]  I'd like to hear from you
[2:11:53.200 --> 2:11:55.200]  if you're able to dial the telephone
[2:11:55.200 --> 2:11:57.200]  and I'm being serious
[2:11:57.200 --> 2:11:59.200]  8002599231
[2:11:59.200 --> 2:12:03.200]  8002599231
[2:12:03.200 --> 2:12:05.200]  8002599231
[2:12:05.200 --> 2:12:07.200]  8002599231
[2:12:07.200 --> 2:12:09.200]  now
[2:12:09.200 --> 2:12:11.200]  I wanted to get him on despite all this big
[2:12:11.200 --> 2:12:13.200]  breaking news the official rollout
[2:12:13.200 --> 2:12:15.200]  of flipping homeland security on
[2:12:15.200 --> 2:12:17.200]  to real Americans you like
[2:12:17.200 --> 2:12:19.200]  John Wayne
[2:12:19.200 --> 2:12:21.200]  you like
[2:12:21.200 --> 2:12:23.200]  fast cars you like freedom
[2:12:23.200 --> 2:12:25.200]  you like
[2:12:25.200 --> 2:12:27.200]  free market you like success
[2:12:27.200 --> 2:12:29.200]  you like prosperity
[2:12:29.200 --> 2:12:31.200]  you're bad you're the enemy you're a terrorist
[2:12:31.200 --> 2:12:33.200]  and again if they can bring me down they can bring everybody down
[2:12:33.200 --> 2:12:35.200]  and they're trying to this is the biggest
[2:12:35.200 --> 2:12:37.200]  assault we've ever seen happening
[2:12:37.200 --> 2:12:39.200]  right now
[2:12:41.200 --> 2:12:43.200]  but they even if they
[2:12:43.200 --> 2:12:45.200]  shut me down which I don't think they can do at this point
[2:12:45.200 --> 2:12:47.200]  and I think this is just the opening salvo
[2:12:47.200 --> 2:12:49.200]  of a larger attack
[2:12:49.200 --> 2:12:51.200]  so I don't want to be
[2:12:51.200 --> 2:12:53.200]  a drama queen here
[2:12:53.200 --> 2:12:55.200]  but it is a big deal this
[2:12:55.200 --> 2:12:57.200]  isn't about Alex Jones this signifies
[2:12:57.200 --> 2:12:59.200]  the rollout the end of the free internet
[2:12:59.200 --> 2:13:01.200]  as we know it which are current issue
[2:13:01.200 --> 2:13:03.200]  of the
[2:13:03.200 --> 2:13:05.200]  magazine is about
[2:13:05.200 --> 2:13:07.200]  death of the internet and we have the proof in this
[2:13:07.200 --> 2:13:09.200]  key issue of the magazine
[2:13:09.200 --> 2:13:11.200]  available in bulk at cost and info or
[2:13:11.200 --> 2:13:13.200]  store.com
[2:13:15.200 --> 2:13:17.200]  if they're able to pull this off
[2:13:17.200 --> 2:13:19.200]  and everybody accepts okay the tea party
[2:13:19.200 --> 2:13:21.200]  or the new terrorist Christians of the new terrorist
[2:13:21.200 --> 2:13:23.200]  evangelical
[2:13:23.200 --> 2:13:25.200]  Christians of the new terrorist that's in the new army
[2:13:25.200 --> 2:13:27.200]  manual at Fort Hood actually said
[2:13:27.200 --> 2:13:29.200]  you'll be court-martialed if you go to evangelical church
[2:13:29.200 --> 2:13:31.200]  it actually said that
[2:13:31.200 --> 2:13:33.200]  or if you're part of the tea party I mean that's beyond
[2:13:33.200 --> 2:13:35.200]  North Korea
[2:13:35.200 --> 2:13:37.200]  if they convert that and get away
[2:13:37.200 --> 2:13:39.200]  with that
[2:13:39.200 --> 2:13:41.200]  they're going to come after everybody
[2:13:41.200 --> 2:13:43.200]  they're going from a free market
[2:13:43.200 --> 2:13:45.200]  and prosperity where the politicians have got
[2:13:45.200 --> 2:13:47.200]  to at least let you be somewhat free to have
[2:13:47.200 --> 2:13:49.200]  prosperity to a total tyranny
[2:13:49.200 --> 2:13:51.200]  by design to totally run your life because
[2:13:51.200 --> 2:13:53.200]  they want to control every aspect of it
[2:13:53.200 --> 2:13:55.200]  they are publicly ending prosperity
[2:13:55.200 --> 2:13:57.200]  under agenda 21 do you understand that
[2:13:57.200 --> 2:13:59.200]  all of you
[2:13:59.200 --> 2:14:01.200]  are in the crosshairs right now
[2:14:03.200 --> 2:14:05.200]  800 25
[2:14:05.200 --> 2:14:07.200]  99 231
[2:14:07.200 --> 2:14:09.200]  the phones have been loaded but as soon as somebody hangs up you can get on
[2:14:09.200 --> 2:14:11.200]  now
[2:14:11.200 --> 2:14:13.200]  Andrew Demeter
[2:14:13.200 --> 2:14:15.200]  is a very interesting individual and I wanted to get him on
[2:14:15.200 --> 2:14:17.200]  and
[2:14:17.200 --> 2:14:19.200]  he had to even fight
[2:14:19.200 --> 2:14:21.200]  to get this tape from C-SPAN
[2:14:21.200 --> 2:14:23.200]  C-SPAN responded and said oh we don't want
[2:14:23.200 --> 2:14:25.200]  to mess up our relationship with the senator
[2:14:25.200 --> 2:14:27.200]  so they're now acting like mainstream
[2:14:27.200 --> 2:14:29.200]  whores with their
[2:14:29.200 --> 2:14:31.200]  footage
[2:14:31.200 --> 2:14:33.200]  for him to get the rights of what's been on
[2:14:33.200 --> 2:14:35.200]  television for him to be able to even
[2:14:35.200 --> 2:14:37.200]  show it when they're supposedly
[2:14:37.200 --> 2:14:39.200]  this public interest oh we don't know
[2:14:39.200 --> 2:14:41.200]  if we wanted out that he asked a real question of
[2:14:41.200 --> 2:14:43.200]  Pelosi that might damage our relationship
[2:14:43.200 --> 2:14:45.200]  that's how you have a lapdog media ladies
[2:14:45.200 --> 2:14:47.200]  and gentlemen
[2:14:47.200 --> 2:14:49.200]  in the United States state run media
[2:14:49.200 --> 2:14:51.200]  his YouTube is team take
[2:14:51.200 --> 2:14:53.200]  I know he's a listener of the broadcast as well
[2:14:53.200 --> 2:14:55.200]  he's been featured on the drudge report
[2:14:55.200 --> 2:14:57.200]  the blaze you name it
[2:14:57.200 --> 2:14:59.200]  he's been interviewed by info wars
[2:14:59.200 --> 2:15:01.200]  in the past as well
[2:15:01.200 --> 2:15:03.200]  which is great then he got picked up by the blaze
[2:15:03.200 --> 2:15:05.200]  and drudge and others that's what we're here to do
[2:15:05.200 --> 2:15:07.200]  and he won
[2:15:07.200 --> 2:15:09.200]  first prize at C-SPAN's annual and national
[2:15:09.200 --> 2:15:11.200]  student camp documentary competition
[2:15:11.200 --> 2:15:13.200]  for his documentary we the people
[2:15:13.200 --> 2:15:15.200]  genetically modified
[2:15:15.200 --> 2:15:17.200]  and it's so exciting
[2:15:19.200 --> 2:15:21.200]  that he's going out asking real questions
[2:15:21.200 --> 2:15:23.200]  making documentaries as a teenager
[2:15:23.200 --> 2:15:25.200]  and now asking real questions this is the model
[2:15:25.200 --> 2:15:27.200]  they can shut Alex Jones down
[2:15:27.200 --> 2:15:29.200]  but the genie's out of the bottle folks
[2:15:29.200 --> 2:15:31.200]  you can go out you can be a success
[2:15:31.200 --> 2:15:33.200]  you can reach out to people
[2:15:33.200 --> 2:15:35.200]  you can change the world
[2:15:35.200 --> 2:15:37.200]  like Andrew
[2:15:37.200 --> 2:15:39.200]  Andrew thanks for coming on with us
[2:15:39.200 --> 2:15:41.200]  thanks for having me on Alex
[2:15:41.200 --> 2:15:43.200]  so we're about to play this clip
[2:15:43.200 --> 2:15:45.200]  of what happened with you and Pelosi
[2:15:45.200 --> 2:15:47.200]  but first off what do you make of the attempted demonization
[2:15:47.200 --> 2:15:49.200]  of anybody
[2:15:49.200 --> 2:15:51.200]  who's a libertarian or conservative
[2:15:51.200 --> 2:15:53.200]  trying to tie us to the latest joker killer
[2:15:53.200 --> 2:15:55.200]  I think it's absolutely ludicrous
[2:15:55.200 --> 2:15:57.200]  I think it's just a false justification
[2:15:57.200 --> 2:15:59.200]  for kind of blaming everything
[2:15:59.200 --> 2:16:01.200]  on people who like me
[2:16:01.200 --> 2:16:03.200]  simply ask a question try to obtain
[2:16:03.200 --> 2:16:05.200]  the truth and again
[2:16:05.200 --> 2:16:07.200]  we've seen it in the past it's just like you said
[2:16:07.200 --> 2:16:09.200]  demonization of any
[2:16:09.200 --> 2:16:11.200]  bit of credibility that we have left
[2:16:11.200 --> 2:16:13.200]  tell folks about the Pelosi Club
[2:16:13.200 --> 2:16:15.200]  yeah so
[2:16:15.200 --> 2:16:17.200]  like you kind of alluded to there in the introduction
[2:16:17.200 --> 2:16:19.200]  I was in Washington DC
[2:16:19.200 --> 2:16:21.200]  I won a documentary competition
[2:16:21.200 --> 2:16:23.200]  called student cam that c-span
[2:16:23.200 --> 2:16:25.200]  annually hosts
[2:16:25.200 --> 2:16:27.200]  and the top five winners
[2:16:27.200 --> 2:16:29.200]  including myself were flown to DC
[2:16:29.200 --> 2:16:31.200]  and the first day we were there
[2:16:31.200 --> 2:16:33.200]  we kind of just toured around DC
[2:16:33.200 --> 2:16:35.200]  second day we had a round table discussion
[2:16:35.200 --> 2:16:37.200]  with c-span that aired eventually later
[2:16:37.200 --> 2:16:39.200]  and then the last day
[2:16:39.200 --> 2:16:41.200]  there was kind of the climactic selling
[2:16:41.200 --> 2:16:43.200]  point of having us go to DC
[2:16:43.200 --> 2:16:45.200]  and that's when we met with Pelosi
[2:16:45.200 --> 2:16:47.200]  and that's when I shot my question to her
[2:16:49.200 --> 2:16:51.200]  now there's a back story that I want you to elaborate on
[2:16:51.200 --> 2:16:53.200]  before we play the clip
[2:16:53.200 --> 2:16:55.200]  of even trying to then get the footage
[2:16:55.200 --> 2:16:57.200]  right
[2:16:57.200 --> 2:16:59.200]  yeah so when after
[2:16:59.200 --> 2:17:01.200]  I had confronted Pelosi that you'll see in a second here
[2:17:01.200 --> 2:17:03.200]  I
[2:17:03.200 --> 2:17:05.200]  the problem was I recorded it with my phone
[2:17:05.200 --> 2:17:07.200]  I had my phone out I was
[2:17:07.200 --> 2:17:09.200]  kind of holding it at my side for a couple
[2:17:09.200 --> 2:17:11.200]  minutes before I confronted her
[2:17:11.200 --> 2:17:13.200]  to just start recording
[2:17:13.200 --> 2:17:15.200]  and then when I eventually asked
[2:17:15.200 --> 2:17:17.200]  the question then I held it up and kind of
[2:17:17.200 --> 2:17:19.200]  put it in her face but the problem
[2:17:19.200 --> 2:17:21.200]  was after that and I only found out
[2:17:21.200 --> 2:17:23.200]  afterwards that the whole video
[2:17:23.200 --> 2:17:25.200]  that I thought I had recorded was eight minutes
[2:17:25.200 --> 2:17:27.200]  and then I found out later that my
[2:17:27.200 --> 2:17:29.200]  phone only recorded four minutes and it's not
[2:17:29.200 --> 2:17:31.200]  some like secretive
[2:17:31.200 --> 2:17:33.200]  issue that the government's trying
[2:17:33.200 --> 2:17:35.200]  to get the clip or anything or erase it
[2:17:35.200 --> 2:17:37.200]  because it was
[2:17:37.200 --> 2:17:39.200]  due to memory and my phones had that issue in the past
[2:17:39.200 --> 2:17:41.200]  sure it's like run out of film
[2:17:41.200 --> 2:17:43.200]  right exactly so then I
[2:17:43.200 --> 2:17:45.200]  contacted C-SPAN when I got back home
[2:17:45.200 --> 2:17:47.200]  asking them if I could have the footage
[2:17:47.200 --> 2:17:49.200]  and because they had a camera man there
[2:17:49.200 --> 2:17:51.200]  and I knew since my footage was
[2:17:51.200 --> 2:17:53.200]  essentially corrupt I just used theirs
[2:17:53.200 --> 2:17:55.200]  so I emailed C-SPAN and mind
[2:17:55.200 --> 2:17:57.200]  you right after we walk out of the Capitol one of
[2:17:57.200 --> 2:17:59.200]  C-SPAN's employees they asked
[2:17:59.200 --> 2:18:01.200]  you know I saw you filming that were you
[2:18:01.200 --> 2:18:03.200]  planning on posting that on YouTube curiously
[2:18:03.200 --> 2:18:05.200]  enough and I thought I had the whole
[2:18:05.200 --> 2:18:07.200]  footage at the time of my phone so I kind
[2:18:07.200 --> 2:18:09.200]  of just said you know why does it matter what difference
[2:18:09.200 --> 2:18:11.200]  does it make as Hillary Clinton would have it
[2:18:11.200 --> 2:18:13.200]  and so then
[2:18:13.200 --> 2:18:15.200]  I eventually emailed C-SPAN like I said when
[2:18:15.200 --> 2:18:17.200]  I got home asking if I could have the clip
[2:18:17.200 --> 2:18:19.200]  and even though I emailed a different
[2:18:19.200 --> 2:18:21.200]  individual the person who confronted
[2:18:21.200 --> 2:18:23.200]  me the C-SPAN employee who
[2:18:23.200 --> 2:18:25.200]  asked me if I was going to post it on YouTube
[2:18:25.200 --> 2:18:27.200]  they responded to that email even though
[2:18:27.200 --> 2:18:29.200]  like I said I didn't send that to them
[2:18:29.200 --> 2:18:31.200]  and they essentially said well per our
[2:18:31.200 --> 2:18:33.200]  agreement with Pelosi's office we can't
[2:18:33.200 --> 2:18:35.200]  give you this footage so I found
[2:18:35.200 --> 2:18:37.200]  that pretty funny you know C-SPAN touts
[2:18:37.200 --> 2:18:39.200]  themselves to be objective and unbiased
[2:18:39.200 --> 2:18:41.200]  yet they won't give me this hard hitting question
[2:18:41.200 --> 2:18:43.200]  but I do have to say it's not C-SPAN's fault
[2:18:43.200 --> 2:18:45.200]  or anything because C-SPAN's
[2:18:45.200 --> 2:18:47.200]  founder Brian Lam and my father and I
[2:18:47.200 --> 2:18:49.200]  actually went back to C-SPAN before we
[2:18:49.200 --> 2:18:51.200]  went back home he essentially
[2:18:51.200 --> 2:18:53.200]  you know encouraged me and congratulated me
[2:18:53.200 --> 2:18:55.200]  saying that I was engaging in real journalism
[2:18:55.200 --> 2:18:57.200]  so I think that really speaks volumes
[2:18:57.200 --> 2:18:59.200]  but then eventually after a long
[2:18:59.200 --> 2:19:01.200]  war waged via email with
[2:19:01.200 --> 2:19:03.200]  C-SPAN and one of their employees
[2:19:03.200 --> 2:19:05.200]  I eventually got back the footage
[2:19:05.200 --> 2:19:07.200]  but I had to essentially call them out
[2:19:07.200 --> 2:19:09.200]  saying you know the whole basis of this contest
[2:19:09.200 --> 2:19:11.200]  I was a part of student cam was to
[2:19:11.200 --> 2:19:13.200]  be objective, be unbiased, be neutral
[2:19:13.200 --> 2:19:15.200]  get both sides of the story and
[2:19:15.200 --> 2:19:17.200]  not like they were essentially trying to do
[2:19:17.200 --> 2:19:19.200]  censor one side that doesn't
[2:19:19.200 --> 2:19:21.200]  fit the agenda.
[2:19:21.200 --> 2:19:23.200]  Well Mr. Demeter I'm going to come back and do one more segment
[2:19:23.200 --> 2:19:25.200]  and we're going to the phone lines here but
[2:19:25.200 --> 2:19:27.200]  I am a fan of original
[2:19:27.200 --> 2:19:29.200]  C-SPAN Brian Lam did an amazing
[2:19:29.200 --> 2:19:31.200]  trailblazing job and so
[2:19:31.200 --> 2:19:33.200]  it shows the culture change he's no longer
[2:19:33.200 --> 2:19:35.200]  from what I know fully running
[2:19:35.200 --> 2:19:37.200]  it and so there you have the founder
[2:19:37.200 --> 2:19:39.200]  commending you but
[2:19:39.200 --> 2:19:41.200]  then now you've got the
[2:19:41.200 --> 2:19:43.200]  the establishment types infiltrating
[2:19:43.200 --> 2:19:45.200]  the bureaucracy trying to
[2:19:45.200 --> 2:19:47.200]  keep you
[2:19:47.200 --> 2:19:49.200]  from showing a simple
[2:19:49.200 --> 2:19:51.200]  question where she
[2:19:51.200 --> 2:19:53.200]  bumbles around I mean they cannot
[2:19:53.200 --> 2:19:55.200]  handle reality we're going to play
[2:19:55.200 --> 2:19:57.200]  the clip they don't want you to see
[2:19:57.200 --> 2:19:59.200]  straight ahead with our gas and then go right to your calls
[2:19:59.200 --> 2:20:25.200]  they was
[2:20:25.200 --> 2:20:29.200]  the
[2:20:29.200 --> 2:20:31.200]  the people grow cotton we fabric
[2:20:31.200 --> 2:20:33.200]  engraving embed strips and fibers to protect
[2:20:33.200 --> 2:20:35.200]  from counterfeit and carting to a
[2:20:35.200 --> 2:20:37.200]  private bank having it led back at
[2:20:37.200 --> 2:20:39.200]  interest forcing taxes to service debt
[2:20:39.200 --> 2:20:41.200]  this capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating
[2:20:41.200 --> 2:20:43.200]  a central bank issuing the public currency is
[2:20:43.200 --> 2:20:45.200]  a greater menace to the liberties of the people
[2:20:45.200 --> 2:20:47.200]  than a standing army. Ted Anderson I'm placing

[2:24:15.200 --> 2:24:17.200]  Andrew Deminer
[2:24:17.200 --> 2:24:19.200]  successful young journalist
[2:24:19.200 --> 2:24:21.200]  just by asking real questions
[2:24:21.200 --> 2:24:23.200]  has been all over Fox News
[2:24:23.200 --> 2:24:25.200]  all over other major networks
[2:24:25.200 --> 2:24:27.200]  all over the blaze
[2:24:27.200 --> 2:24:29.200]  with Glenn Beck
[2:24:29.200 --> 2:24:31.200]  and of course we've interviewed him for a while
[2:24:31.200 --> 2:24:33.200]  and I think helped him get his word out
[2:24:33.200 --> 2:24:35.200]  but his own talent
[2:24:35.200 --> 2:24:37.200]  his own research and his own commitment
[2:24:37.200 --> 2:24:39.200]  is why he's become successful
[2:24:39.200 --> 2:24:41.200]  and I use this as an example to everyone
[2:24:41.200 --> 2:24:43.200]  out there of what you can do
[2:24:43.200 --> 2:24:45.200]  but you're not trying to become a famous
[2:24:45.200 --> 2:24:47.200]  media personality
[2:24:47.200 --> 2:24:49.200]  you're not trying to
[2:24:49.200 --> 2:24:51.200]  be successful
[2:24:51.200 --> 2:24:53.200]  to be a celebrity
[2:24:53.200 --> 2:24:55.200]  you don't want to become well known
[2:24:55.200 --> 2:24:57.200]  as a symbol of the fact
[2:24:57.200 --> 2:24:59.200]  that you've been successful promoting the ideas of liberty
[2:24:59.200 --> 2:25:01.200]  and then
[2:25:01.200 --> 2:25:03.200]  building your own platform to self sustain
[2:25:03.200 --> 2:25:05.200]  because in the Bill Clinton memos
[2:25:05.200 --> 2:25:07.200]  where they coined the term conspiracy theorist
[2:25:07.200 --> 2:25:09.200]  in modern parlance
[2:25:09.200 --> 2:25:11.200]  they say we will apply this to anything unorthodox
[2:25:11.200 --> 2:25:13.200]  to control all narratives
[2:25:13.200 --> 2:25:15.200]  because we don't want the public having
[2:25:15.200 --> 2:25:17.200]  anything but state run media
[2:25:17.200 --> 2:25:19.200]  it's a 30 something page memo
[2:25:19.200 --> 2:25:21.200]  it's several hundred pages long
[2:25:21.200 --> 2:25:23.200]  and daily only got 30 something pages
[2:25:23.200 --> 2:25:25.200]  now they have the whole document that's coming out soon
[2:25:25.200 --> 2:25:27.200]  but it's so damaging
[2:25:27.200 --> 2:25:29.200]  that they're having to look with lawyers
[2:25:29.200 --> 2:25:31.200]  to see about if they can even release it
[2:25:31.200 --> 2:25:33.200]  it's that bad
[2:25:33.200 --> 2:25:35.200]  I guess they got the rest of it leaked to them
[2:25:35.200 --> 2:25:37.200]  out of the Bill Clinton library
[2:25:37.200 --> 2:25:39.200]  I guess they've got moles in there
[2:25:39.200 --> 2:25:41.200]  but my point is that they're threatened by this
[2:25:41.200 --> 2:25:43.200]  and they're threatened by Andrew
[2:25:43.200 --> 2:25:45.200]  so I want to play this clip right now
[2:25:45.200 --> 2:25:47.200]  and then get your take on it
[2:25:47.200 --> 2:25:49.200]  and ask where you're going from here
[2:25:49.200 --> 2:25:51.200]  to the federal question
[2:25:51.200 --> 2:25:53.200]  something that again the extinct media won't do
[2:25:53.200 --> 2:25:55.200]  they've extincted themselves
[2:25:55.200 --> 2:25:57.200]  here it is
[2:25:57.200 --> 2:25:59.200]  why do you support the NSA's illegal
[2:25:59.200 --> 2:26:01.200]  and ubiquitous data collection
[2:26:01.200 --> 2:26:03.200]  well I
[2:26:03.200 --> 2:26:05.200]  have questions about the metadata
[2:26:05.200 --> 2:26:07.200]  collection that they were
[2:26:07.200 --> 2:26:09.200]  collecting unless they had
[2:26:09.200 --> 2:26:11.200]  a reason to do so
[2:26:11.200 --> 2:26:13.200]  so I found
[2:26:13.200 --> 2:26:15.200]  I didn't support
[2:26:15.200 --> 2:26:17.200]  that resolution
[2:26:17.200 --> 2:26:19.200]  that was the appropriate resolution
[2:26:19.200 --> 2:26:21.200]  but I do think that
[2:26:21.200 --> 2:26:23.200]  the burden is on
[2:26:23.200 --> 2:26:25.200]  the department and I have fought them
[2:26:25.200 --> 2:26:27.200]  for years on the community
[2:26:27.200 --> 2:26:29.200]  fought them for years on the wide
[2:26:29.200 --> 2:26:31.200]  spot that they have put out there
[2:26:31.200 --> 2:26:33.200]  you did vote for a bill to continue
[2:26:33.200 --> 2:26:35.200]  funding for the NSA though
[2:26:35.200 --> 2:26:37.200]  yeah of course I don't think we should
[2:26:37.200 --> 2:26:39.200]  not fund the international security agency
[2:26:39.200 --> 2:26:41.200]  no they do many things
[2:26:41.200 --> 2:26:43.200]  isn't the NSA a clear violation of the fourth amendment
[2:26:43.200 --> 2:26:45.200]  no some of what
[2:26:45.200 --> 2:26:47.200]  but they do should be subjected
[2:26:47.200 --> 2:26:49.200]  to scrutiny in some of the things
[2:26:49.200 --> 2:26:51.200]  but they perform many other functions
[2:26:51.200 --> 2:26:53.200]  as well
[2:26:53.200 --> 2:26:55.200]  and we hold them to a high order
[2:26:55.200 --> 2:26:57.200]  and I've had my biggest fight
[2:26:57.200 --> 2:26:59.200]  here in the intelligence community
[2:26:59.200 --> 2:27:01.200]  with the director of the NSA
[2:27:01.200 --> 2:27:03.200]  Hayden when he was the director I don't think
[2:27:03.200 --> 2:27:05.200]  he was on the level with us
[2:27:05.200 --> 2:27:07.200]  but that doesn't mean that there aren't other
[2:27:07.200 --> 2:27:09.200]  things that are there
[2:27:09.200 --> 2:27:11.200]  that are good things
[2:27:11.200 --> 2:27:13.200]  that are necessary
[2:27:13.200 --> 2:27:15.200]  for us to have
[2:27:15.200 --> 2:27:17.200]  but from 9-11 on
[2:27:17.200 --> 2:27:19.200]  the Bush administration went too far
[2:27:19.200 --> 2:27:21.200]  on all of these things
[2:27:21.200 --> 2:27:23.200]  and we had the correspondence
[2:27:23.200 --> 2:27:25.200]  back and forth
[2:27:25.200 --> 2:27:27.200]  to demonstrate that
[2:27:27.200 --> 2:27:29.200]  they were just doing the wrong thing
[2:27:29.200 --> 2:27:31.200]  now again for me Andrew
[2:27:31.200 --> 2:27:33.200]  the issue is they tried to keep
[2:27:33.200 --> 2:27:35.200]  that video from getting out
[2:27:35.200 --> 2:27:37.200]  because they don't even want to know that she voted for it
[2:27:37.200 --> 2:27:39.200]  and I love the lawyer speak there
[2:27:39.200 --> 2:27:41.200]  where she's saying
[2:27:41.200 --> 2:27:43.200]  there's a lot of things
[2:27:43.200 --> 2:27:45.200]  and we need them to do it within a system
[2:27:45.200 --> 2:27:47.200]  so she says we need to be able to
[2:27:47.200 --> 2:27:49.200]  spy on you without war it's just in a system
[2:27:49.200 --> 2:27:51.200]  this is a huge power grab
[2:27:51.200 --> 2:27:53.200]  we're witnessing
[2:27:53.200 --> 2:27:55.200]  yeah I think it's really funny
[2:27:55.200 --> 2:27:57.200]  my favorite part of that whole video
[2:27:57.200 --> 2:27:59.200]  that whole confrontation is just the fact that
[2:27:59.200 --> 2:28:01.200]  she diffuses all responsibility
[2:28:01.200 --> 2:28:03.200]  to the Bush administration even though
[2:28:03.200 --> 2:28:05.200]  I'm not even for Bush I'm a libertarian
[2:28:05.200 --> 2:28:07.200]  but the fact that he was in office
[2:28:07.200 --> 2:28:09.200]  six years ago
[2:28:09.200 --> 2:28:11.200]  Bush signed into law post 9-11
[2:28:11.200 --> 2:28:13.200]  the patriot act which was essentially
[2:28:13.200 --> 2:28:15.200]  the same thing that the NSA
[2:28:15.200 --> 2:28:17.200]  is now except the NSA
[2:28:17.200 --> 2:28:19.200]  is much larger in schools
[2:28:19.200 --> 2:28:21.200]  oh he's gone way beyond Bush
[2:28:21.200 --> 2:28:23.200]  I didn't defend as well I attacked it
[2:28:23.200 --> 2:28:25.200]  and the democrats were all part of that
[2:28:25.200 --> 2:28:27.200]  it's like if we get a republican blue blood in
[2:28:27.200 --> 2:28:29.200]  they'll be blaming Obama for shutting down
[2:28:29.200 --> 2:28:31.200]  our power plants but not reopening them
[2:28:31.200 --> 2:28:33.200]  I mean it's always past the buck basically
[2:28:33.200 --> 2:28:35.200]  but yeah it's just so funny
[2:28:35.200 --> 2:28:37.200]  how she's saying well I
[2:28:37.200 --> 2:28:39.200]  didn't support what Bush was doing
[2:28:39.200 --> 2:28:41.200]  he's gone too far yet
[2:28:41.200 --> 2:28:43.200]  what she supports now under the Obama
[2:28:43.200 --> 2:28:45.200]  administration a fellow democrat
[2:28:45.200 --> 2:28:47.200]  you know now she supports that
[2:28:47.200 --> 2:28:49.200]  so it's completely hypocritical
[2:28:49.200 --> 2:28:51.200]  and I also find it funny how
[2:28:51.200 --> 2:28:53.200]  she's supposedly a representative
[2:28:53.200 --> 2:28:55.200]  to the American people yet
[2:28:55.200 --> 2:28:57.200]  she can't even explain
[2:28:57.200 --> 2:28:59.200]  why she voted for something
[2:28:59.200 --> 2:29:01.200]  supposedly what the American people
[2:29:01.200 --> 2:29:03.200]  are in support of
[2:29:03.200 --> 2:29:05.200]  so the fact that she can't even
[2:29:05.200 --> 2:29:07.200]  explain it let alone to a group of teenagers
[2:29:07.200 --> 2:29:09.200]  I find very disconcerting
[2:29:09.200 --> 2:29:11.200]  and it shows that she's never asked real
[2:29:11.200 --> 2:29:13.200]  questions until you come along
[2:29:13.200 --> 2:29:15.200]  and point out the emperor's butt naked
[2:29:15.200 --> 2:29:17.200]  in closing what's coming
[2:29:17.200 --> 2:29:19.200]  next for you Andrew
[2:29:19.200 --> 2:29:21.200]  you know I'm just keeping the doors open
[2:29:21.200 --> 2:29:23.200]  I'm gonna see what comes next
[2:29:23.200 --> 2:29:25.200]  Leanne told me to tell you
[2:29:25.200 --> 2:29:27.200]  to hire me but you know
[2:29:27.200 --> 2:29:29.200]  I just like getting out there getting
[2:29:29.200 --> 2:29:31.200]  my message across and
[2:29:31.200 --> 2:29:33.200]  it's important to say also that this video
[2:29:33.200 --> 2:29:35.200]  is about promoting myself it's about
[2:29:35.200 --> 2:29:37.200]  not about me or not even about
[2:29:37.200 --> 2:29:39.200]  Pelosi but just exposing
[2:29:39.200 --> 2:29:41.200]  the fact that politicians can be very
[2:29:41.200 --> 2:29:43.200]  hypocritical but it's also important to say
[2:29:43.200 --> 2:29:45.200]  I agree but you become successful
[2:29:45.200 --> 2:29:47.200]  by asking real questions but you also
[2:29:47.200 --> 2:29:49.200]  win while doing the right thing
[2:29:49.200 --> 2:29:51.200]  we're on the march the empire

[2:31:59.200 --> 2:32:01.200]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here
[2:32:01.200 --> 2:32:03.200]  with some important information
[2:32:03.200 --> 2:32:05.200]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk
[2:32:05.200 --> 2:32:07.200]  and his team of patriots over at mypatriotsupply
[2:32:07.200 --> 2:32:09.200]  several years ago
[2:32:09.200 --> 2:32:11.200]  Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment
[2:32:11.200 --> 2:32:13.200]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed
[2:32:13.200 --> 2:32:15.200]  and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck
[2:32:15.200 --> 2:32:17.200]  deciding to take action
[2:32:17.200 --> 2:32:19.200]  a company run by patriots for patriots
[2:32:19.200 --> 2:32:21.200]  was born
[2:32:21.200 --> 2:32:23.200]  and their supply has never taken a loan
[2:32:23.200 --> 2:32:25.200]  or accepted outside funding
[2:32:25.200 --> 2:32:27.200]  they now operate two distribution facilities
[2:32:27.200 --> 2:32:29.200]  and employ over 50 hard working
[2:32:29.200 --> 2:32:31.200]  American men and women
[2:32:31.200 --> 2:32:33.200]  it is rare to find companies who practice what they preach
[2:32:33.200 --> 2:32:35.200]  and that's why I stock my pantry
[2:32:35.200 --> 2:32:37.200]  with high quality storeable foods

[2:33:49.200 --> 2:33:51.200]  with
[2:33:51.200 --> 2:33:53.200]  medicine breaking down
[2:33:53.200 --> 2:33:55.200]  with flesh eating bacteria
[2:33:55.200 --> 2:33:57.200]  just on so many fronts global crises
[2:33:57.200 --> 2:33:59.200]  are being exacerbated
[2:33:59.200 --> 2:34:01.200]  because the world technocrats
[2:34:01.200 --> 2:34:03.200]  have decided to go with crises
[2:34:03.200 --> 2:34:05.200]  and fan crises
[2:34:05.200 --> 2:34:07.200]  and build them
[2:34:07.200 --> 2:34:09.200]  so they can pose as a saviors
[2:34:09.200 --> 2:34:11.200]  and bring in total control
[2:34:11.200 --> 2:34:13.200]  the
[2:34:13.200 --> 2:34:15.200]  Hegelian dialectic of problem reaction
[2:34:15.200 --> 2:34:17.200]  solution so I'm going to go to your phone calls here
[2:34:17.200 --> 2:34:19.200]  the guys pointed out
[2:34:19.200 --> 2:34:21.200]  they said Alex we got like 8 or 9 clips
[2:34:21.200 --> 2:34:23.200]  of different MSNBC
[2:34:23.200 --> 2:34:25.200]  CNN attacking you
[2:34:25.200 --> 2:34:27.200]  hundreds of newspapers
[2:34:27.200 --> 2:34:29.200]  thousands of blogs
[2:34:29.200 --> 2:34:31.200]  all of them White House affiliated
[2:34:31.200 --> 2:34:33.200]  or run
[2:34:33.200 --> 2:34:35.200]  literally saying that I influenced
[2:34:35.200 --> 2:34:37.200]  the guy to kill people
[2:34:37.200 --> 2:34:39.200]  and he started acting like a civil war
[2:34:39.200 --> 2:34:41.200]  is about to break out but it's a good thing
[2:34:41.200 --> 2:34:43.200]  I mean it is just insane
[2:34:43.200 --> 2:34:45.200]  let's play a few of the clips go to your calls
[2:34:45.200 --> 2:34:47.200]  and back to clips
[2:34:47.200 --> 2:34:49.200]  John bound there's too many of them I've got a list here
[2:34:49.200 --> 2:34:51.200]  you found even more
[2:34:51.200 --> 2:34:53.200]  you found Danny DeVito from the Penguin
[2:34:53.200 --> 2:34:55.200]  I mean some lady from
[2:34:55.200 --> 2:34:57.200]  the Southern Poverty Law Center

[2:35:07.200 --> 2:35:09.200]  this is MSNBC
[2:35:09.200 --> 2:35:11.200]  the government needs to take this seriously
[2:35:11.200 --> 2:35:13.200]  these kinds of people have killed more Americans
[2:35:13.200 --> 2:35:15.200]  domestically
[2:35:15.200 --> 2:35:17.200]  than Islamic extremists in the last several years
[2:35:17.200 --> 2:35:19.200]  this is a serious threat
[2:35:19.200 --> 2:35:21.200]  and the government has to be looking at these things
[2:35:21.200 --> 2:35:23.200]  well we're going to
[2:35:23.200 --> 2:35:25.200]  that's from Al Sharpton's FBI program
[2:35:25.200 --> 2:35:27.200]  now
[2:35:27.200 --> 2:35:29.200]  shifting gears into the same subject
[2:35:29.200 --> 2:35:31.200]  we never played this yet too there's so many clips
[2:35:31.200 --> 2:35:33.200]  can you pull up the CNN saying the same thing
[2:35:33.200 --> 2:35:35.200]  that now
[2:35:35.200 --> 2:35:37.200]  the Tea Party is more threatening than Al Qaeda
[2:35:39.200 --> 2:35:41.200]  see what I'm talking about here folks
[2:35:41.200 --> 2:35:43.200]  now I'm on record telling you this
[2:35:43.200 --> 2:35:45.200]  six years before it started
[2:35:47.200 --> 2:35:49.200]  this is their battle plan
[2:35:49.200 --> 2:35:51.200]  it's been their battle plan
[2:35:51.200 --> 2:35:53.200]  all along
[2:35:53.200 --> 2:35:55.200]  there's the article infowars.com
[2:35:55.200 --> 2:35:57.200]  Kurt Nemo CNN says
[2:35:57.200 --> 2:35:59.200]  Liberty Movement more threatening than Al Qaeda
[2:35:59.200 --> 2:36:01.200]  we're going to go ahead
[2:36:01.200 --> 2:36:03.200]  and play you
[2:36:03.200 --> 2:36:05.200]  that clip
[2:36:05.200 --> 2:36:07.200]  so it's CNN
[2:36:07.200 --> 2:36:09.200]  it's MSNBC
[2:36:09.200 --> 2:36:11.200]  it's
[2:36:11.200 --> 2:36:13.200]  all of them
[2:36:13.200 --> 2:36:15.200]  let's go ahead and play the clip
[2:36:15.200 --> 2:36:17.200]  but on the airwaves today
[2:36:17.200 --> 2:36:19.200]  conspiracy theorist Alex Jones
[2:36:19.200 --> 2:36:21.200]  of whom Jared Miller was
[2:36:21.200 --> 2:36:23.200]  allegedly a fan of
[2:36:23.200 --> 2:36:25.200]  Alex Jones fomented even more
[2:36:25.200 --> 2:36:29.200]  anti-government paranoia
[2:36:29.200 --> 2:36:31.200]  we're in the middle of a globalist
[2:36:31.200 --> 2:36:33.200]  revolution against this country
[2:36:33.200 --> 2:36:35.200]  right now and my gut
[2:36:37.200 --> 2:36:39.200]  tells me
[2:36:39.200 --> 2:36:41.200]  that the cold
[2:36:41.200 --> 2:36:43.200]  blooded degenerate
[2:36:43.200 --> 2:36:45.200]  evil
[2:36:45.200 --> 2:36:47.200]  killing of two police officers and a citizen
[2:36:47.200 --> 2:36:49.200]  in Las Vegas
[2:36:51.200 --> 2:36:53.200]  yesterday
[2:36:53.200 --> 2:36:55.200]  is absolutely
[2:36:55.200 --> 2:36:57.200]  staged
[2:36:57.200 --> 2:36:59.200]  ladies and gentlemen
[2:36:59.200 --> 2:37:01.200]  joining me now is the host of MSNBC's
[2:37:01.200 --> 2:37:03.200]  the read report, Joy Reid
[2:37:03.200 --> 2:37:05.200]  and again in Kurt's article
[2:37:05.200 --> 2:37:07.200]  the first clip he has is from MSNBC
[2:37:07.200 --> 2:37:09.200]  there's another the story of Jared
[2:37:09.200 --> 2:37:11.200]  and Amanda Miller
[2:37:11.200 --> 2:37:13.200]  and that's the one where they say the same thing
[2:37:13.200 --> 2:37:15.200]  we have a quote in the article
[2:37:15.200 --> 2:37:17.200]  we're going to add that to the video
[2:37:17.200 --> 2:37:19.200]  and I'm going to play that as well
[2:37:19.200 --> 2:37:21.200]  where CNN says Liberty Movement
[2:37:21.200 --> 2:37:23.200]  so let's get the clip on
[2:37:23.200 --> 2:37:25.200]  that subject
[2:37:25.200 --> 2:37:27.200]  we got a bunch more of the Al Sharpton
[2:37:27.200 --> 2:37:29.200]  we haven't played Chris Matthews demonizing me
[2:37:29.200 --> 2:37:31.200]  but again here's the quote
[2:37:31.200 --> 2:37:33.200]  the attack in Vegas from CNN
[2:37:33.200 --> 2:37:35.200]  is far from the only incident
[2:37:35.200 --> 2:37:37.200]  of violence in America far right
[2:37:37.200 --> 2:37:39.200]  Peter Bergen built a CNN's
[2:37:39.200 --> 2:37:41.200]  national security analyst
[2:37:41.200 --> 2:37:43.200]  so now we have the national security analyst
[2:37:43.200 --> 2:37:45.200]  telling us how citizens are the threat
[2:37:45.200 --> 2:37:47.200]  I mean that's the definition of an authoritarian country
[2:37:47.200 --> 2:37:49.200]  anyone caught out after dark
[2:37:49.200 --> 2:37:51.200]  will be permanently detained
[2:37:51.200 --> 2:37:53.200]  aka the running man
[2:37:53.200 --> 2:37:55.200]  quote according to data collected by the New American Foundation
[2:37:55.200 --> 2:37:57.200]  right wing extremists have killed 37 people
[2:37:57.200 --> 2:37:59.200]  in 16 violent incidents
[2:37:59.200 --> 2:38:01.200]  oh my gosh honeybills
[2:38:01.200 --> 2:38:03.200]  bees killed 230 something
[2:38:03.200 --> 2:38:05.200]  in the United States since 9-11
[2:38:05.200 --> 2:38:07.200]  did you hear that in 12 years
[2:38:07.200 --> 2:38:09.200]  37 people
[2:38:09.200 --> 2:38:11.200]  some ADL front group says
[2:38:11.200 --> 2:38:13.200]  let's read the rest of this
[2:38:13.200 --> 2:38:15.200]  let's all of Homeland Security
[2:38:15.200 --> 2:38:17.200]  hundreds of billions a year
[2:38:17.200 --> 2:38:19.200]  30 years
[2:38:19.200 --> 2:38:21.200]  so oh my gosh
[2:38:21.200 --> 2:38:23.200]  37 people in 16 violent incidents
[2:38:23.200 --> 2:38:25.200]  the United States is 9-11
[2:38:25.200 --> 2:38:27.200]  the number
[2:38:27.200 --> 2:38:29.200]  that's about 3 a year
[2:38:29.200 --> 2:38:31.200]  the number is more than 21 people
[2:38:31.200 --> 2:38:33.200]  killed by militants
[2:38:33.200 --> 2:38:35.200]  motivated by Al Qaeda audiology in the United States
[2:38:35.200 --> 2:38:37.200]  that's because it's made up
[2:38:37.200 --> 2:38:39.200]  they run the Saudi Arabian terrorists
[2:38:39.200 --> 2:38:41.200]  the criminals that run our country
[2:38:41.200 --> 2:38:43.200]  they're running them in Syria
[2:38:43.200 --> 2:38:45.200]  where they killed 300,000 people
[2:38:45.200 --> 2:38:47.200]  only Christians
[2:38:47.200 --> 2:38:49.200]  alright I said I'd go to your calls
[2:38:49.200 --> 2:38:51.200]  it's just
[2:38:51.200 --> 2:38:53.200]  what a hoax
[2:38:53.200 --> 2:38:55.200]  I don't believe anything they say
[2:38:55.200 --> 2:38:57.200]  we have no idea what really happened in Vegas
[2:38:59.200 --> 2:39:01.200]  I mean it's that bad folks
[2:39:01.200 --> 2:39:03.200]  we don't know what happened to Sandy Hook
[2:39:03.200 --> 2:39:05.200]  I mean they had blue screens down there
[2:39:05.200 --> 2:39:07.200]  with Anderson Cooper disappearing on screen
[2:39:07.200 --> 2:39:09.200]  CNN did fake Scott Missel attacks
[2:39:09.200 --> 2:39:11.200]  in 1990
[2:39:11.200 --> 2:39:13.200]  you can't believe
[2:39:13.200 --> 2:39:15.200]  anything they say
[2:39:15.200 --> 2:39:17.200]  it's like believing Bill Clinton
[2:39:19.200 --> 2:39:21.200]  and they call that a conspiracy theory
[2:39:21.200 --> 2:39:23.200]  because he put it in a memo
[2:39:23.200 --> 2:39:25.200]  ordering the media
[2:39:25.200 --> 2:39:27.200]  if you question any of his lies
[2:39:27.200 --> 2:39:29.200]  he calls you that name
[2:39:29.200 --> 2:39:31.200]  I don't care what name you call me
[2:39:31.200 --> 2:39:33.200]  throw me in the briar patch
[2:39:35.200 --> 2:39:37.200]  let's play the Chris Matthews
[2:39:37.200 --> 2:39:43.200]  and then we'll go to the calls
[2:40:07.200 --> 2:40:09.200]  those two people really didn't do what they did
[2:40:09.200 --> 2:40:11.200]  they didn't shoot the two police officers
[2:40:11.200 --> 2:40:13.200]  they didn't shoot the civilian at Walmart
[2:40:13.200 --> 2:40:15.200]  I was wondering about conspiracy theories
[2:40:15.200 --> 2:40:17.200]  what did I think did happen
[2:40:17.200 --> 2:40:19.200]  if it didn't happen as we saw it happening
[2:40:19.200 --> 2:40:21.200]  he thinks it's a false flag operation
[2:40:21.200 --> 2:40:23.200]  like the Boston Marathon bombing
[2:40:23.200 --> 2:40:25.200]  and what I think is important here
[2:40:25.200 --> 2:40:27.200]  is there are conservative people of goodwill
[2:40:27.200 --> 2:40:29.200]  and wonderful folks on that side of the fence
[2:40:29.200 --> 2:40:31.200]  but what we have to have is some kind of agreement
[2:40:31.200 --> 2:40:33.200]  about process and demonization
[2:40:33.200 --> 2:40:35.200]  and resolving conflicts
[2:40:35.200 --> 2:40:37.200]  and more broadly let me just say to the left as well
[2:40:37.200 --> 2:40:39.200]  oh yeah
[2:40:39.200 --> 2:40:41.200]  just everybody let's be nice
[2:40:41.200 --> 2:40:43.200]  this is not an assault
[2:40:43.200 --> 2:40:45.200]  lay down GI
[2:40:45.200 --> 2:40:47.200]  lay down Tokyo Rose loves you
[2:40:47.200 --> 2:40:49.200]  she'll kiss you and put you to bed at night
[2:40:51.200 --> 2:40:53.200]  let's go to your phone calls
[2:40:53.200 --> 2:40:55.200]  I appreciate Jess calling and holding for 30 minutes
[2:40:55.200 --> 2:40:57.200]  Jess in Texas your first up
[2:40:57.200 --> 2:40:59.200]  what do you think about all this
[2:40:59.200 --> 2:41:01.200]  should we just believe known certified liars
[2:41:01.200 --> 2:41:03.200]  who tell us they lie to us
[2:41:03.200 --> 2:41:05.200]  they've staged other stuff
[2:41:05.200 --> 2:41:07.200]  I mean is it wrong that I question known certified liars
[2:41:09.200 --> 2:41:11.200]  I don't think it's wrong
[2:41:11.200 --> 2:41:13.200]  and first off I just want to say
[2:41:13.200 --> 2:41:15.200]  I've been watching you since Austin Access days
[2:41:15.200 --> 2:41:17.200]  I don't know how long that's been now
[2:41:17.200 --> 2:41:19.200]  but
[2:41:19.200 --> 2:41:21.200]  and I own guns and I've never gone out and shot anybody
[2:41:21.200 --> 2:41:23.200]  and I'm not playing
[2:41:23.200 --> 2:41:25.200]  well you owning guns made the crime rate go down 52%
[2:41:25.200 --> 2:41:27.200]  the FBI admits that's the main reason
[2:41:27.200 --> 2:41:29.200]  I mean the crime rate went down
[2:41:29.200 --> 2:41:31.200]  52% with guns because there's more guns
[2:41:31.200 --> 2:41:33.200]  I mean it's a fact so just go ahead
[2:41:33.200 --> 2:41:35.200]  you're a bad person
[2:41:35.200 --> 2:41:37.200]  yeah and so I'm bad for owning guns
[2:41:37.200 --> 2:41:39.200]  one and I just
[2:41:39.200 --> 2:41:41.200]  I was reading a bunch of articles last night
[2:41:41.200 --> 2:41:43.200]  it just seems like everything
[2:41:43.200 --> 2:41:45.200]  just escalating and there's
[2:41:45.200 --> 2:41:47.200]  just quickening going on
[2:41:47.200 --> 2:41:49.200]  and it seems like something really big is coming
[2:41:49.200 --> 2:41:51.200]  I don't know what it is
[2:41:51.200 --> 2:41:53.200]  but it's not caused by
[2:41:53.200 --> 2:41:55.200]  the people or Alex Jones
[2:41:55.200 --> 2:41:57.200]  I don't think you have
[2:41:57.200 --> 2:41:59.200]  that much power over people
[2:41:59.200 --> 2:42:01.200]  I mean you reach a lot of people
[2:42:01.200 --> 2:42:03.200]  but you're not brainwashing
[2:42:03.200 --> 2:42:05.200]  and controlling people
[2:42:05.200 --> 2:42:07.200]  well I wish I had more power
[2:42:07.200 --> 2:42:09.200]  I say probably every day
[2:42:09.200 --> 2:42:11.200]  neurotically to the point of family says
[2:42:11.200 --> 2:42:13.200]  quit saying it
[2:42:13.200 --> 2:42:15.200]  it sounds crazy
[2:42:17.200 --> 2:42:19.200]  when I say don't shoot police
[2:42:19.200 --> 2:42:21.200]  well I mean they're always saying
[2:42:21.200 --> 2:42:23.200]  I'm making people shoot police
[2:42:23.200 --> 2:42:25.200]  so I'm saying don't shoot police
[2:42:25.200 --> 2:42:27.200]  and then they say I'm saying shoot police
[2:42:27.200 --> 2:42:29.200]  don't shoot police
[2:42:29.200 --> 2:42:31.200]  don't shoot police
[2:42:31.200 --> 2:42:33.200]  don't shoot police
[2:42:33.200 --> 2:42:35.200]  but they're saying I'm making people shoot police
[2:42:35.200 --> 2:42:37.200]  so what am I supposed to do
[2:42:37.200 --> 2:42:39.200]  I obviously don't have power
[2:42:39.200 --> 2:42:41.200]  over these people
[2:42:41.200 --> 2:42:43.200]  I think the average police should be glad
[2:42:43.200 --> 2:42:45.200]  I'm here trying to stop a civil war
[2:42:45.200 --> 2:42:47.200]  I mean do you understand they want to start a civil war
[2:42:47.200 --> 2:42:49.200]  do people realize
[2:42:49.200 --> 2:42:51.200]  that it'll be like nuclear bombs
[2:42:51.200 --> 2:42:53.200]  going off in this country politically
[2:42:53.200 --> 2:42:55.200]  and economically and physically
[2:42:55.200 --> 2:42:57.200]  the civil war in this country
[2:42:57.200 --> 2:42:59.200]  killed over 300,000 people
[2:42:59.200 --> 2:43:01.200]  in four years in the 1860s
[2:43:01.200 --> 2:43:03.200]  do you know what a civil war
[2:43:03.200 --> 2:43:05.200]  they've built Obama as this Lincoln savior
[2:43:05.200 --> 2:43:07.200]  and they plan to have him
[2:43:07.200 --> 2:43:09.200]  with the domestic security force start a civil war
[2:43:09.200 --> 2:43:11.200]  they've admitted that was their plan the whole time
[2:43:11.200 --> 2:43:13.200]  do you realize they want to have civil war part two
[2:43:13.200 --> 2:43:15.200]  how many people you think are going to die in that brother
[2:43:17.200 --> 2:43:19.200]  there'll be millions I mean at least
[2:43:19.200 --> 2:43:21.200]  that's not more
[2:43:21.200 --> 2:43:23.200]  and let me tell you
[2:43:23.200 --> 2:43:25.200]  there are telling cops in official memos
[2:43:25.200 --> 2:43:27.200]  that are in Forbes
[2:43:27.200 --> 2:43:29.200]  not infowars.com
[2:43:29.200 --> 2:43:31.200]  that there's going to be a civil war
[2:43:31.200 --> 2:43:33.200]  and the enemy is the veterans
[2:43:33.200 --> 2:43:35.200]  they're telling cops
[2:43:35.200 --> 2:43:37.200]  pick a fight with the veterans
[2:43:37.200 --> 2:43:39.200]  that's like go and stick your
[2:43:39.200 --> 2:43:41.200]  you know what in a beehive
[2:43:41.200 --> 2:43:43.200]  to you know quote
[2:43:43.200 --> 2:43:45.200]  somebody from anonymous I forget exactly who said that
[2:43:45.200 --> 2:43:47.200]  but I mean
[2:43:47.200 --> 2:43:49.200]  this is not a good idea
[2:43:49.200 --> 2:43:51.200]  it's like
[2:43:51.200 --> 2:43:53.200]  I'm going to say it
[2:43:53.200 --> 2:43:55.200]  I'm going for the weirdest stuff
[2:43:55.200 --> 2:43:57.200]  now that I talk about that
[2:43:57.200 --> 2:43:59.200]  I mean it would be like putting a funnel in your mouth
[2:43:59.200 --> 2:44:01.200]  up against a beehive and having them fly down your lungs
[2:44:01.200 --> 2:44:03.200]  I mean
[2:44:03.200 --> 2:44:05.200]  it'd be like sticking your hand in a meat grinder
[2:44:05.200 --> 2:44:07.200]  in a garbage disposal
[2:44:07.200 --> 2:44:09.200]  I've got a family
[2:44:09.200 --> 2:44:11.200]  I've got children I want stability
[2:44:11.200 --> 2:44:13.200]  I want to fix things peacefully
[2:44:13.200 --> 2:44:15.200]  they want to start a civil war
[2:44:15.200 --> 2:44:17.200]  anything else
[2:44:17.200 --> 2:44:19.200]  I mean I just cannot tell people enough
[2:44:19.200 --> 2:44:21.200]  to stop it we've got to stop it
[2:44:21.200 --> 2:44:23.200]  go ahead
[2:44:23.200 --> 2:44:25.200]  I just think it's
[2:44:25.200 --> 2:44:27.200]  just insane
[2:44:27.200 --> 2:44:29.200]  how many different articles are
[2:44:29.200 --> 2:44:31.200]  I mean they're
[2:44:31.200 --> 2:44:33.200]  saying that oh Alex Jones liked
[2:44:33.200 --> 2:44:35.200]  this guy's facebook page
[2:44:35.200 --> 2:44:37.200]  at brand paul liked this facebook page
[2:44:37.200 --> 2:44:39.200]  and all these people they're just trying to lump together
[2:44:39.200 --> 2:44:41.200]  and none of it's confirmed
[2:44:41.200 --> 2:44:43.200]  and I mean there's just
[2:44:43.200 --> 2:44:45.200]  all the trolls all over the internet
[2:44:45.200 --> 2:44:47.200]  and people don't know any better
[2:44:47.200 --> 2:44:49.200]  on either facebook or a news site
[2:44:49.200 --> 2:44:51.200]  and they take it as fact
[2:44:51.200 --> 2:44:53.200]  well sir I mean they've got facebook's
[2:44:53.200 --> 2:44:55.200]  with me with my head
[2:44:55.200 --> 2:44:57.200]  photoshopped on a priest robe
[2:44:57.200 --> 2:44:59.200]  claiming I'm a pedophile priest and I'm not even catholic
[2:44:59.200 --> 2:45:01.200]  they've got websites
[2:45:01.200 --> 2:45:03.200]  with me photoshopped with transvestites
[2:45:03.200 --> 2:45:05.200]  having sex and people think it's real
[2:45:05.200 --> 2:45:07.200]  I mean
[2:45:07.200 --> 2:45:09.200]  exactly I mean I've been through this
[2:45:09.200 --> 2:45:11.200]  we don't know if this is really their stuff
[2:45:11.200 --> 2:45:13.200]  we don't know if he was some deep cover informant
[2:45:13.200 --> 2:45:15.200]  of theirs listen
[2:45:15.200 --> 2:45:17.200]  I get fundamentally
[2:45:17.200 --> 2:45:19.200]  like I'm at the edge of a cliff I appreciate your call
[2:45:19.200 --> 2:45:21.200]  when I talk about Oklahoma City
[2:45:21.200 --> 2:45:23.200]  and the names of the FBI agents
[2:45:23.200 --> 2:45:25.200]  the CIA people
[2:45:25.200 --> 2:45:27.200]  and the that were inside the building planning
[2:45:27.200 --> 2:45:29.200]  the bombs that were seen by multiple witnesses they killed
[2:45:29.200 --> 2:45:31.200]  some of the witnesses including police officer
[2:45:31.200 --> 2:45:33.200]  the year Terence Yakey
[2:45:33.200 --> 2:45:35.200]  and some medical folks but I've talked to
[2:45:35.200 --> 2:45:37.200]  one of the survivors that lived after the testimony
[2:45:37.200 --> 2:45:39.200]  Jane Graham here on air I've talked to other police
[2:45:39.200 --> 2:45:41.200]  officers that saw it going on
[2:45:41.200 --> 2:45:43.200]  like Don Browning
[2:45:43.200 --> 2:45:45.200]  highly decorated marine Vietnam
[2:45:45.200 --> 2:45:47.200]  head of the canine unit
[2:45:47.200 --> 2:45:49.200]  for 30-something years until he retired there
[2:45:49.200 --> 2:45:51.200]  and every time I talk about it
[2:45:51.200 --> 2:45:53.200]  I feel like I'm at the edge of a cliff because we name
[2:45:53.200 --> 2:45:55.200]  names in that show folks and I got death threats over it
[2:45:57.200 --> 2:45:59.200]  we got the hotel receipts
[2:45:59.200 --> 2:46:01.200]  they lied and said they weren't there they were seen by
[2:46:01.200 --> 2:46:03.200]  witnesses planting the bombs
[2:46:03.200 --> 2:46:05.200]  and I feel like I'm on the edge of a cliff when I talk
[2:46:05.200 --> 2:46:07.200]  about it because I'm smart I know
[2:46:07.200 --> 2:46:09.200]  the kind of stuff that'll get me killed
[2:46:09.200 --> 2:46:11.200]  or set up but I mean at a certain point
[2:46:11.200 --> 2:46:13.200]  you got to just go I'm not afraid anymore
[2:46:15.200 --> 2:46:17.200]  and
[2:46:17.200 --> 2:46:19.200]  this attorney general was the deputy attorney general
[2:46:19.200 --> 2:46:21.200]  and his emails came out in lawsuits
[2:46:21.200 --> 2:46:23.200]  in Salt Lake City
[2:46:23.200 --> 2:46:25.200]  or people that were killed
[2:46:25.200 --> 2:46:27.200]  because their families have standing
[2:46:27.200 --> 2:46:29.200]  and he was involved in the cover up bare minimum
[2:46:29.200 --> 2:46:31.200]  I mean they ran the false flag
[2:46:31.200 --> 2:46:33.200]  of
[2:46:33.200 --> 2:46:35.200]  that's inferious
[2:46:35.200 --> 2:46:37.200]  that killed thousands I mean I am literally
[2:46:37.200 --> 2:46:39.200]  on air
[2:46:39.200 --> 2:46:41.200]  they're trying to put the head of the Veritas project
[2:46:41.200 --> 2:46:43.200]  in jail routinely
[2:46:43.200 --> 2:46:45.200]  they're trying to put the Nessia Suza in prison
[2:46:45.200 --> 2:46:47.200]  they've tried all sorts of crap with me to put me
[2:46:47.200 --> 2:46:49.200]  in jail I mean I won't even get into it all folks
[2:46:49.200 --> 2:46:51.200]  it's just let me explain something this is real
[2:46:51.200 --> 2:46:53.200]  folks okay this isn't a game
[2:46:53.200 --> 2:46:55.200]  I know who these people are
[2:46:55.200 --> 2:46:57.200]  they're bad
[2:46:57.200 --> 2:46:59.200]  does that mean the average FBI person's bad no
[2:46:59.200 --> 2:47:01.200]  a lot of them are good people does that mean the average
[2:47:01.200 --> 2:47:03.200]  cop's bad no they're great people on average
[2:47:05.200 --> 2:47:07.200]  but they've got unlimited power now in this corrupt
[2:47:07.200 --> 2:47:09.200]  system and they're they got bad people
[2:47:09.200 --> 2:47:11.200]  on top that are getting away
[2:47:11.200 --> 2:47:13.200]  with murder let's go to your calls again
[2:47:13.200 --> 2:47:15.200]  I'm gonna shut up I'm just really freaked
[2:47:15.200 --> 2:47:17.200]  out man I'm freaked out because
[2:47:17.200 --> 2:47:19.200]  I don't want to be right I'm freaked out
[2:47:19.200 --> 2:47:21.200]  because it's over the top folks
[2:47:27.200 --> 2:47:29.200]  I mean just as sure as the sun came up this
[2:47:29.200 --> 2:47:31.200]  morning they're getting ready to stage a civil war
[2:47:31.200 --> 2:47:33.200]  and I don't know how to stop them
[2:47:33.200 --> 2:47:35.200]  and then it's got the cherry on top that
[2:47:35.200 --> 2:47:37.200]  I'm gonna get blamed in the middle of it
[2:47:37.200 --> 2:47:39.200]  don't you see folks how
[2:47:39.200 --> 2:47:41.200]  epically horrid this is but
[2:47:41.200 --> 2:47:43.200]  we could stop it
[2:47:43.200 --> 2:47:45.200]  I should do a whole show tomorrow on how do we
[2:47:45.200 --> 2:47:47.200]  stop it I don't know
[2:47:47.200 --> 2:47:49.200]  what we do at this point I mean it's so
[2:47:49.200 --> 2:47:51.200]  horrible
[2:47:51.200 --> 2:47:53.200]  they're shutting the country down
[2:47:53.200 --> 2:47:55.200]  they're stealing the pension funds they're
[2:47:55.200 --> 2:47:57.200]  bankrupting us they're shutting everything off
[2:47:57.200 --> 2:47:59.200]  the borders are wide open
[2:47:59.200 --> 2:48:01.200]  they're funding Al Qaeda
[2:48:01.200 --> 2:48:03.200]  and then
[2:48:03.200 --> 2:48:05.200]  if we resist even
[2:48:05.200 --> 2:48:07.200]  in words they call us terrorists
[2:48:09.200 --> 2:48:11.200]  Brian in North Carolina
[2:48:11.200 --> 2:48:13.200]  you're on the air
[2:48:13.200 --> 2:48:15.200]  yeah Alex
[2:48:15.200 --> 2:48:17.200]  I'm a singer songwriter in a band
[2:48:17.200 --> 2:48:19.200]  called the damn quails we just turned
[2:48:19.200 --> 2:48:21.200]  the east coast we're out here got a
[2:48:21.200 --> 2:48:23.200]  bunch of survival shields keeping us
[2:48:23.200 --> 2:48:25.200]  detoxified
[2:48:25.200 --> 2:48:27.200]  very interesting
[2:48:27.200 --> 2:48:29.200]  yeah we've been seeing a bunch of
[2:48:29.200 --> 2:48:31.200]  trucks spraying the glyphosates man
[2:48:31.200 --> 2:48:33.200]  and every time we stop along the rest of my
[2:48:33.200 --> 2:48:35.200]  way you can smell that stuff out here we're in
[2:48:35.200 --> 2:48:37.200]  North Carolina right now well it is a sterile
[2:48:37.200 --> 2:48:39.200]  and it also grows breast tumors
[2:48:39.200 --> 2:48:41.200]  on record I mean they admit it grows
[2:48:41.200 --> 2:48:43.200]  breast cancer but no one will
[2:48:43.200 --> 2:48:45.200]  say hey let's stop using
[2:48:45.200 --> 2:48:47.200]  it or get something else
[2:48:47.200 --> 2:48:49.200]  let's just find a cure for it well how
[2:48:49.200 --> 2:48:51.200]  about the cure is not having glyphosate
[2:48:51.200 --> 2:48:53.200]  in the drinking water
[2:48:53.200 --> 2:48:55.200]  it literally sounds like poison
[2:48:55.200 --> 2:48:57.200]  my grandmother will
[2:48:57.200 --> 2:48:59.200]  not get surgery
[2:48:59.200 --> 2:49:01.200]  she's almost 90 and she's still sharp
[2:49:01.200 --> 2:49:03.200]  and I love her as much as anybody in my family
[2:49:03.200 --> 2:49:05.200]  she's had breast cancer for three years
[2:49:05.200 --> 2:49:07.200]  and it's slowly growing and she lives
[2:49:07.200 --> 2:49:09.200]  long enough it'll kill her but I mean
[2:49:09.200 --> 2:49:11.200]  this has touched me everybody's been touched by breast cancer
[2:49:11.200 --> 2:49:13.200]  my wives mother
[2:49:13.200 --> 2:49:15.200]  it makes me mad
[2:49:15.200 --> 2:49:17.200]  and turns out Monsanto knows exactly
[2:49:17.200 --> 2:49:19.200]  what they're doing sir what do you think
[2:49:19.200 --> 2:49:21.200]  of the
[2:49:21.200 --> 2:49:23.200]  I'm not mad at you but I opened the calls up
[2:49:23.200 --> 2:49:25.200]  and I said
[2:49:25.200 --> 2:49:27.200]  I'm talking about Civil War
[2:49:27.200 --> 2:49:29.200]  and the shootings and how they're now staying
[2:49:29.200 --> 2:49:31.200]  Homeland Security for the Tea Party for me
[2:49:31.200 --> 2:49:33.200]  I think that's a big deal that the anti-terror
[2:49:33.200 --> 2:49:35.200]  apparatus is for the Republican Party
[2:49:35.200 --> 2:49:37.200]  and I think the Republican leadership should come
[2:49:37.200 --> 2:49:39.200]  out and speak out against this but instead
[2:49:39.200 --> 2:49:41.200]  they're working with the Democrats to go
[2:49:41.200 --> 2:49:43.200]  after the libertarian wing of the
[2:49:43.200 --> 2:49:45.200]  Republican Party I say this is off the
[2:49:45.200 --> 2:49:47.200]  chart big I appreciate your call Brian
[2:49:47.200 --> 2:49:49.200]  anybody else calling about this
[2:49:49.200 --> 2:49:51.200]  let's talk to Jacob in Arkansas
[2:49:51.200 --> 2:49:53.200]  Jacob go ahead
[2:49:53.200 --> 2:49:55.200]  hey man how you doing
[2:49:55.200 --> 2:49:57.200]  I just this is above my
[2:49:57.200 --> 2:49:59.200]  pay grade I'm in over my head but so is
[2:49:59.200 --> 2:50:01.200]  everybody oh my god
[2:50:01.200 --> 2:50:03.200]  I totally understand what you're saying

[2:50:09.200 --> 2:50:11.200]  but what I called in about was
[2:50:11.200 --> 2:50:13.200]  I think how the Civil
[2:50:13.200 --> 2:50:15.200]  War is actually going to go down is
[2:50:15.200 --> 2:50:17.200]  financially the dollars going to crash
[2:50:17.200 --> 2:50:19.200]  and why I'm really nervous
[2:50:19.200 --> 2:50:21.200]  and I think
[2:50:21.200 --> 2:50:23.200]  the dollars going to collapse
[2:50:23.200 --> 2:50:25.200]  and then the food stamp zombies
[2:50:25.200 --> 2:50:27.200]  are literally going to start raping and
[2:50:27.200 --> 2:50:29.200]  pillaging the land and people like

[2:55:32.200 --> 2:55:34.200]  legalize everybody on top of it being by fiat

[2:55:38.200 --> 2:55:40.200]  overrun by criminal aliens
[2:55:40.200 --> 2:55:42.200]  we confirmed his identity and he's a border
[2:55:42.200 --> 2:55:44.200]  agent and he didn't even
[2:55:44.200 --> 2:55:46.200]  say we couldn't use his name but i told
[2:55:46.200 --> 2:55:48.200]  salazar wrote the article writing his name
[2:55:48.200 --> 2:55:50.200]  don salazar to just
[2:55:50.200 --> 2:55:52.200]  just say name with hell to protect
[2:55:52.200 --> 2:55:54.200]  source we confirm the source so
[2:55:54.200 --> 2:55:56.200]  we're gonna add that to the bottom of the article that this is a confirmed
[2:55:56.200 --> 2:55:58.200]  border patrol source
[2:55:58.200 --> 2:56:00.200]  and by the way folks when you send us these letters
[2:56:00.200 --> 2:56:02.200]  or photos or intel
[2:56:02.200 --> 2:56:04.200]  tell us if you want your name
[2:56:04.200 --> 2:56:06.200]  out or not
[2:56:06.200 --> 2:56:08.200]  you know that that's always important
[2:56:08.200 --> 2:56:10.200]  we
[2:56:10.200 --> 2:56:12.200]  sometimes people say well with hold this we will hold
[2:56:12.200 --> 2:56:14.200]  even more
[2:56:14.200 --> 2:56:16.200]  but i mean i think you already had the head of the union
[2:56:16.200 --> 2:56:18.200]  come out and say there they plan to get rid of the border entirely
[2:56:18.200 --> 2:56:20.200]  and it's totally criminal and lawless so there's
[2:56:20.200 --> 2:56:22.200]  somewhat public because they have a union
[2:56:22.200 --> 2:56:24.200]  so you could say unions are bad
[2:56:24.200 --> 2:56:26.200]  but then sometimes they're good
[2:56:26.200 --> 2:56:28.200]  because then they can tell the truth
[2:56:28.200 --> 2:56:30.200]  and have some protection
[2:56:30.200 --> 2:56:32.200]  but
[2:56:32.200 --> 2:56:34.200]  you got 24 troops
[2:56:34.200 --> 2:56:36.200]  committing suicide every day
[2:56:36.200 --> 2:56:38.200]  you got more u.s. soldiers killed and friendly fire
[2:56:38.200 --> 2:56:40.200]  but it's the end of the world when two cops die
[2:56:40.200 --> 2:56:42.200]  cops die every day on auto bemail accidents
[2:56:42.200 --> 2:56:44.200]  you know it's a dangerous job i'm sad it
[2:56:44.200 --> 2:56:46.200]  happened it's terrible but i'm not taking the guilt
[2:56:46.200 --> 2:56:48.200]  for it i mean this
[2:56:48.200 --> 2:56:50.200]  this guy that reportedly killed the people out in california
[2:56:50.200 --> 2:56:52.200]  if you believe the official story last week
[2:56:52.200 --> 2:56:54.200]  was a democrat on record
[2:56:54.200 --> 2:56:56.200]  big fan msnbc the young turks
[2:56:56.200 --> 2:56:58.200]  i'm not blaming them for it the guy was a nutball
[2:57:00.200 --> 2:57:02.200]  but i don't act
[2:57:02.200 --> 2:57:04.200]  and operate like they do
[2:57:06.200 --> 2:57:08.200]  al qaeda has seized another iraq city
[2:57:08.200 --> 2:57:10.200]  after nato gave him a base
[2:57:10.200 --> 2:57:12.200]  in western iraq i mean this is just out of control
[2:57:14.200 --> 2:57:16.200]  this is so out of control but drudgereport.com
[2:57:16.200 --> 2:57:18.200]  is linked to our article from adan salazar
[2:57:18.200 --> 2:57:22.200]  breaking it down
[2:57:22.200 --> 2:57:24.200]  and i mean folks i've lived in texas forever
[2:57:26.200 --> 2:57:28.200]  the hispanics in texas there's much
[2:57:28.200 --> 2:57:30.200]  a part of texas as anybody
[2:57:30.200 --> 2:57:32.200]  black white doesn't matter more so
[2:57:32.200 --> 2:57:34.200]  that's fine that's part of texas culture
[2:57:36.200 --> 2:57:38.200]  the issue here
[2:57:38.200 --> 2:57:40.200]  is that
[2:57:40.200 --> 2:57:42.200]  the jobs are gone the illegals get on welfare
[2:57:42.200 --> 2:57:44.200]  and work on top of it that's the phenomenon of the illegals
[2:57:44.200 --> 2:57:46.200]  welfare and they work
[2:57:46.200 --> 2:57:48.200]  because they want to make money and have a better life
[2:57:48.200 --> 2:57:50.200]  the point is they're being used as a political weapon
[2:57:50.200 --> 2:57:52.200]  and i've never seen
[2:57:52.200 --> 2:57:54.200]  what looked like a hundred day laborers
[2:57:54.200 --> 2:57:56.200]  out front the home depot
[2:57:56.200 --> 2:57:58.200]  on the side of i-35 and
[2:57:58.200 --> 2:58:00.200]  290
[2:58:00.200 --> 2:58:02.200]  coming to work
[2:58:02.200 --> 2:58:04.200]  till the day i was downtown doing some business and i was driving up
[2:58:04.200 --> 2:58:06.200]  and i mean it was like a hundred people
[2:58:06.200 --> 2:58:08.200]  but i was late to work it was like 30 minutes to showtime
[2:58:08.200 --> 2:58:10.200]  i'd gotten ready at home
[2:58:10.200 --> 2:58:12.200]  and i was driving
[2:58:12.200 --> 2:58:14.200]  and
[2:58:14.200 --> 2:58:16.200]  that's like a hundred people
[2:58:16.200 --> 2:58:18.200]  i was like well at least they want to work but here's the issue
[2:58:18.200 --> 2:58:20.200]  they get told by the democrats
[2:58:20.200 --> 2:58:22.200]  you get all this welfare for your wife to stay home
[2:58:22.200 --> 2:58:24.200]  take care of your kids well they go i like that idea
[2:58:24.200 --> 2:58:26.200]  okay i'll take some money
[2:58:26.200 --> 2:58:28.200]  and you just vote democrat alright
[2:58:28.200 --> 2:58:30.200]  and they go yes sir and again it's not that i'm even a republican
[2:58:30.200 --> 2:58:32.200]  except now it's an endgame
[2:58:32.200 --> 2:58:34.200]  i don't like having two parties i want ten parties
[2:58:34.200 --> 2:58:36.200]  now we're only going to have one
[2:58:36.200 --> 2:58:38.200]  we'll be back in overdrive

[3:01:27.200 --> 3:01:29.200]  who's going to vote
[3:01:29.200 --> 3:01:31.200]  or you know the idiot jellyfish
[3:01:31.200 --> 3:01:33.200]  who's on their side
[3:01:33.200 --> 3:01:35.200]  to be against us when they come after us
[3:01:35.200 --> 3:01:37.200]  like it's all going to start off
[3:01:37.200 --> 3:01:39.200]  when their food gets cut off
[3:01:39.200 --> 3:01:41.200]  the zombies i'm talking about
[3:01:41.200 --> 3:01:43.200]  when their food gets cut off
[3:01:43.200 --> 3:01:45.200]  then they're going to come after us
[3:01:45.200 --> 3:01:47.200]  because we're prepared and we're going to start
[3:01:47.200 --> 3:01:49.200]  having to kill them by the tens of thousands
[3:01:49.200 --> 3:01:51.200]  then that's when the military
[3:01:51.200 --> 3:01:53.200]  and four troops are going to have to come
[3:01:53.200 --> 3:01:55.200]  curtail
[3:01:55.200 --> 3:01:57.200]  the quote civil disturbances
[3:01:57.200 --> 3:01:59.200]  and we're going to be in the right
[3:01:59.200 --> 3:02:01.200]  when we have to defend ourselves
[3:02:01.200 --> 3:02:03.200]  but this whole time they demonized us
[3:02:03.200 --> 3:02:05.200]  wow that totally clicks
[3:02:05.200 --> 3:02:07.200]  that an economic implosion like Greece or somewhere
[3:02:07.200 --> 3:02:09.200]  where they had incredible violence destruction
[3:02:09.200 --> 3:02:11.200]  Spain you name it
[3:02:11.200 --> 3:02:13.200]  that when that kicks off here they're going to call it terrorism
[3:02:13.200 --> 3:02:15.200]  and then anyone
[3:02:15.200 --> 3:02:17.200]  that defends themselves is going to be called a terrorist
[3:02:17.200 --> 3:02:19.200]  that makes a lot and they'll call it
[3:02:19.200 --> 3:02:21.200]  race war because Michael Moore and others
[3:02:21.200 --> 3:02:23.200]  they have a meme they say anybody in the country
[3:02:23.200 --> 3:02:25.200]  with a gun is a racist
[3:02:25.200 --> 3:02:27.200]  who wants to kill blacks
[3:02:27.200 --> 3:02:29.200]  well a lot of the blacks i know are moving to the country
[3:02:29.200 --> 3:02:31.200]  and getting guns at home school and their kids
[3:02:31.200 --> 3:02:33.200]  and that's what we do
[3:02:33.200 --> 3:02:35.200]  man i think
[3:02:35.200 --> 3:02:37.200]  that's in the cards
[3:02:37.200 --> 3:02:39.200]  i know that's what they're really training for
[3:02:39.200 --> 3:02:41.200]  with all the armored vehicles and stuff
[3:02:41.200 --> 3:02:43.200]  and then using it as side training
[3:02:43.200 --> 3:02:45.200]  to say it's for the tea party
[3:02:45.200 --> 3:02:47.200]  the tea party is the last group that you're going to have to have any problems with
[3:02:47.200 --> 3:02:49.200]  unless you try to go
[3:02:49.200 --> 3:02:51.200]  enslave them
[3:02:51.200 --> 3:02:53.200]  yeah that's the one thing we can't
[3:02:53.200 --> 3:02:55.200]  offensively do anything but when we're attacked
[3:02:55.200 --> 3:02:57.200]  we have to defend ourselves
[3:02:57.200 --> 3:02:59.200]  but then you got MS
[3:02:59.200 --> 3:03:01.200]  MS whatever
[3:03:01.200 --> 3:03:03.200]  i call them MSLSD because they all seem like
[3:03:03.200 --> 3:03:05.200]  they're some kind of drugs the whole time
[3:03:05.200 --> 3:03:07.200]  what they are is a group
[3:03:07.200 --> 3:03:09.200]  of hardcore fascists
[3:03:09.200 --> 3:03:11.200]  who know exactly what they're doing
[3:03:11.200 --> 3:03:13.200]  they're following a script
[3:03:13.200 --> 3:03:15.200]  they're operatives i would imagine
[3:03:15.200 --> 3:03:17.200]  most of them are actually
[3:03:17.200 --> 3:03:19.200]  officers that are making or saluting
[3:03:19.200 --> 3:03:21.200]  and a lot of them aren't american
[3:03:21.200 --> 3:03:23.200]  officers and by the way it's come out CNN's
[3:03:23.200 --> 3:03:25.200]  a bunch of pentagon staff
[3:03:25.200 --> 3:03:27.200]  it's beyond evil sir anything else
[3:03:27.200 --> 3:03:29.200]  well can i plug one of your products
[3:03:29.200 --> 3:03:31.200]  before i go
[3:03:31.200 --> 3:03:33.200]  the fluoride shield is by far
[3:03:33.200 --> 3:03:35.200]  my favorite i've taken the nation
[3:03:35.200 --> 3:03:37.200]  i've done the superman vitality is amazing
[3:03:37.200 --> 3:03:39.200]  don't get me wrong but when i first started
[3:03:39.200 --> 3:03:41.200]  taking the fluoride shield
[3:03:41.200 --> 3:03:43.200]  you're right man i mean the toxins
[3:03:43.200 --> 3:03:45.200]  and stuff that come out of your skin is
[3:03:45.200 --> 3:03:47.200]  absolutely disgusting
[3:03:47.200 --> 3:03:49.200]  but when you wake up in the morning and you
[3:03:49.200 --> 3:03:51.200]  feel like you know you just feel like re-energized
[3:03:51.200 --> 3:03:53.200]  it's amazing
[3:03:53.200 --> 3:03:55.200]  our number one sleeper product
[3:03:55.200 --> 3:03:57.200]  it's the it's the least best selling
[3:03:57.200 --> 3:03:59.200]  and i think it was the best thing
[3:03:59.200 --> 3:04:01.200]  we came out with i held it as genius
[3:04:01.200 --> 3:04:03.200]  when dr. group and other researchers
[3:04:03.200 --> 3:04:05.200]  came out with six
[3:04:05.200 --> 3:04:07.200]  compounds well-known documented
[3:04:07.200 --> 3:04:09.200]  to be super key layers and detoxifiers
[3:04:09.200 --> 3:04:11.200]  and it's double the size of the
[3:04:11.200 --> 3:04:13.200]  bottle for only a fraction
[3:04:13.200 --> 3:04:15.200]  of a higher price than a regular fluoride
[3:04:15.200 --> 3:04:17.200]  shield of the survival shield
[3:04:17.200 --> 3:04:19.200]  i think it is the
[3:04:19.200 --> 3:04:21.200]  sleeper product
[3:04:21.200 --> 3:04:23.200]  and you know what to encourage people to get on
[3:04:23.200 --> 3:04:25.200]  it i think we ought to do a sale
[3:04:25.200 --> 3:04:27.200]  of it
[3:04:27.200 --> 3:04:29.200]  for a set of thirty nine dollars
[3:04:29.200 --> 3:04:31.200]  we should do it for twenty nine ninety five

[3:08:27.200 --> 3:08:31.200]  We're live, fixed bayonets, we're in overdrive in the Info Ward,
[3:08:31.200 --> 3:08:36.200]  nonviolent cultural revolution against the cultural dehumanist,
[3:08:36.200 --> 3:08:42.200]  the cultural beyond Marxism eugenicists that we face.
[3:08:42.200 --> 3:08:45.200]  Being aware of their manipulation is the end of their manipulation.
[3:08:45.200 --> 3:08:48.200]  Resisting their manipulation is victory.
[3:08:48.200 --> 3:08:52.200]  No one can be conquered who wants to be free.
[3:08:52.200 --> 3:08:56.200]  But you have to know the battle space to be free.
[3:08:56.200 --> 3:08:58.200]  And you have to know the police are not your enemy,
[3:08:58.200 --> 3:09:02.200]  even though they want to create a civil war and are telling the police
[3:09:02.200 --> 3:09:08.200]  that anybody who doesn't worship Mao Zedong is a murdering cop killer.
[3:09:08.200 --> 3:09:12.200]  This is the attempt for a total domestic takeover.
[3:09:12.200 --> 3:09:13.200]  Because they're scared.
[3:09:13.200 --> 3:09:16.200]  They know the libertarian movement's taking the country back.
[3:09:16.200 --> 3:09:20.200]  Let's go to Chris in North Carolina, you're on the air, go ahead.
[3:09:20.200 --> 3:09:22.200]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing?
[3:09:22.200 --> 3:09:24.200]  I'm alright, thanks for holding, thanks for calling.
[3:09:24.200 --> 3:09:26.200]  Hey, I just want to ask you about the Act of 1871.
[3:09:26.200 --> 3:09:32.200]  I think it's a way we can prevent a civil war and really get from under the bankers.
[3:09:32.200 --> 3:09:34.200]  I don't know if you've ever heard about it.
[3:09:34.200 --> 3:09:35.200]  What are you talking about?
[3:09:35.200 --> 3:09:40.200]  That was the reversal of the abuses of Reconstruction?
[3:09:40.200 --> 3:09:43.200]  Yeah, the United States was in some financial troubles
[3:09:43.200 --> 3:09:47.200]  and made a deal with the devil, with the Rothschilds and other bankers.
[3:09:47.200 --> 3:09:53.200]  And basically reworded the Constitution and put it on the track we're on today.
[3:09:53.200 --> 3:09:55.200]  Well, you know, I'm familiar with that a little bit.
[3:09:55.200 --> 3:09:57.200]  Refresh my memory more about it.
[3:09:57.200 --> 3:10:05.200]  Well, they signed the Act and then they needed money.
[3:10:05.200 --> 3:10:11.200]  So they gave bankers a lot of control over the country.
[3:10:11.200 --> 3:10:18.200]  Well, that's right, in the 30s and 1830s and such, the President Jackson fought against that on his deathbed
[3:10:18.200 --> 3:10:19.200]  and said, I killed the bank.
[3:10:19.200 --> 3:10:25.200]  But they did get quasi control in the 1870s, but they didn't get really full control until 1913.
[3:10:25.200 --> 3:10:29.200]  We need to rebalance the Federal Reserve, the Storglass, Geagle, great point.
[3:10:29.200 --> 3:10:32.200]  What do you think about them trying to foment a civil war?
[3:10:32.200 --> 3:10:34.200]  It is crazy.
[3:10:34.200 --> 3:10:37.200]  There was another school shooting this afternoon in Oregon.
[3:10:37.200 --> 3:10:41.200]  Yeah, that's probably gang related, two people shot including a shooter.
[3:10:41.200 --> 3:10:42.200]  It's going to happen.
[3:10:42.200 --> 3:10:45.200]  It's part of a free society, but you got a much better chance.
[3:10:45.200 --> 3:10:49.200]  I think it's like 15 to 20 times putting on the year to die on a car wreck.
[3:10:49.200 --> 3:10:55.200]  Better chance of being electrocuted, falling in the bathtub for non-self-inflicted gun wounds.
[3:10:55.200 --> 3:11:00.200]  If you add suicide, I think it's like 12,000 a year to the tally of gunshot deaths,
[3:11:00.200 --> 3:11:03.200]  then it's more than drowning.
[3:11:03.200 --> 3:11:07.200]  I mean, you know, ban lakes, I mean, you've got a ban swimming, more people die swimming in the lake.
[3:11:07.200 --> 3:11:11.200]  I mean, it's just you're going to die, folks.
[3:11:11.200 --> 3:11:13.200]  It's bad guys with guns, not the guns.
[3:11:13.200 --> 3:11:15.200]  I know our audience knows that.
[3:11:15.200 --> 3:11:17.200]  We need to explain that to people.
[3:11:17.200 --> 3:11:22.200]  And me saying, don't kill cops if you're mad at the government,
[3:11:22.200 --> 3:11:29.200]  because it's like killing a bank teller because you're mad at your bank.
[3:11:29.200 --> 3:11:34.200]  That equals Alex Jones once cops killed and is influencing people to kill cops
[3:11:34.200 --> 3:11:39.200]  according to CNN and MSNBC.
[3:11:39.200 --> 3:11:44.200]  That's the craziness we're talking about here, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:11:44.200 --> 3:11:45.200]  That's the insanity.
[3:11:45.200 --> 3:11:49.200]  By the way, did we ever get the CNN clip where they say now,
[3:11:49.200 --> 3:11:53.200]  I know we have the MSNBC, but Kurt quotes it here and we have a link to it.
[3:11:53.200 --> 3:11:57.200]  Do we have that where they now say the Tea Party's the enemy, not Al Qaeda,
[3:11:57.200 --> 3:12:01.200]  but the Tea Party's the main threat?
[3:12:01.200 --> 3:12:08.200]  Yeah, because we talked about that last hour and we were going to see what was going to go on with that headline.
[3:12:08.200 --> 3:12:13.200]  Because I know CNN did say that, but then we have a clip of MSNBC saying it and it's confusing people.
[3:12:13.200 --> 3:12:14.200]  So it's not a big deal.
[3:12:14.200 --> 3:12:16.200]  I just talked about it a couple of times.
[3:12:16.200 --> 3:12:18.200]  I just want to find out.
[3:12:18.200 --> 3:12:22.200]  So please let me know.
[3:12:22.200 --> 3:12:27.200]  Let's go to Chase in Colorado, Chase you're on the air.
[3:12:27.200 --> 3:12:34.200]  Hey, Alex, I am calling about there's a shooting at a high school in Oregon today.
[3:12:34.200 --> 3:12:40.200]  And I was, I'm sure your crew is following it.
[3:12:40.200 --> 3:12:51.200]  I think our government is going live with these events now like a 9-11 event just like Vegas yesterday or the day before.
[3:12:51.200 --> 3:12:58.200]  Right now it sounds like there's one shooter and one student dead.
[3:12:58.200 --> 3:13:13.200]  But I think this was a live event because a lot of the families seem like they are really distressed and pretty well put together waiting for their kids to get off these buses.
[3:13:13.200 --> 3:13:16.200]  They're taking the kids from the high school to the supermarket.
[3:13:16.200 --> 3:13:22.200]  No, I know they told the parents you don't get your kids, they were doing this before the school shootings even popped up again.
[3:13:22.200 --> 3:13:25.200]  Again, on a graph, there was a lot of gang related stuff in the 80s and 90s.
[3:13:25.200 --> 3:13:26.200]  That's why it's still flat.
[3:13:26.200 --> 3:13:27.200]  But it is true.
[3:13:27.200 --> 3:13:33.200]  There's a little bit of an increase in weirdo mass shootings because they're hyping them where it's not gang related.
[3:13:33.200 --> 3:13:35.200]  But you average it together with the gang related.
[3:13:35.200 --> 3:13:39.200]  It's flat and it's all media hype.
[3:13:39.200 --> 3:13:44.200]  And yeah, they've been hyping the school shooting things since before it started.
[3:13:44.200 --> 3:13:48.200]  And a lot of the psychologists chalk it up to the video games.
[3:13:48.200 --> 3:13:58.200]  And again, I'm not saying ban the shoot them up games, but already unstable mentally ill people are on drugs, legal and legal.
[3:13:58.200 --> 3:14:01.200]  From the Arizona shooter to you name it.
[3:14:01.200 --> 3:14:03.200]  And they're always devil worshipers.
[3:14:03.200 --> 3:14:10.200]  They've always, when there's real shootings, they're devil worshipers with satanic shrines who are into death in every case.
[3:14:10.200 --> 3:14:13.200]  So what do you bottom line things going on in Oregon?
[3:14:13.200 --> 3:14:18.200]  Well, my point was a lot of the students are reporting the second shooter.
[3:14:18.200 --> 3:14:30.200]  They said when they started shooting, the official story says that there was one shooter and a lot of the students, they said, when they started shooting, we started to run.
[3:14:30.200 --> 3:14:37.200]  Well, I mean, guys print off the latest on that because I just saw it and kind of didn't follow it because I was busy focused on the big issues.
[3:14:37.200 --> 3:14:47.200]  Yeah, but I just want a basic print on like what happened, we're both killed because that's when it's a big telltale when everyone involved is killed.
[3:14:47.200 --> 3:14:49.200]  That's a good cover for it being staged.
[3:14:49.200 --> 3:14:51.200]  So I just need the basic numbers on that.
[3:14:51.200 --> 3:14:52.200]  Thanks.
[3:14:52.200 --> 3:15:01.200]  Shooter was killed and the shooter might have been killed by police or something, but it's just so convenient like this other case.
[3:15:01.200 --> 3:15:02.200]  Thank you.
[3:15:02.200 --> 3:15:03.200]  Thank you, Chase.
[3:15:03.200 --> 3:15:04.200]  Jason in Tennessee.
[3:15:04.200 --> 3:15:05.200]  You're on the air.
[3:15:05.200 --> 3:15:06.200]  Thanks for holding.
[3:15:06.200 --> 3:15:08.200]  Oh, Alex, can you hear me?
[3:15:08.200 --> 3:15:10.200]  Yes, I sure can.
[3:15:10.200 --> 3:15:11.200]  How are you doing?
[3:15:11.200 --> 3:15:12.200]  It's an honor to speak with you.
[3:15:12.200 --> 3:15:14.200]  Well, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[3:15:14.200 --> 3:15:16.200]  Go ahead.
[3:15:16.200 --> 3:15:20.200]  I just wanted to say thank you for everything you do.
[3:15:20.200 --> 3:15:21.200]  No, no, don't do that.
[3:15:21.200 --> 3:15:22.200]  You've walked me up.
[3:15:22.200 --> 3:15:23.200]  You've walked me up.
[3:15:23.200 --> 3:15:27.200]  I started listening to you probably right after 9-11-2001.
[3:15:27.200 --> 3:15:30.200]  You woke me up and I can't thank you enough for that.
[3:15:30.200 --> 3:15:34.200]  I was just like the other zombies watching the news and believing it.
[3:15:34.200 --> 3:15:46.200]  Well, Jason, I can't thank WBCR 1470, our oldest affiliate after Rochester, New York, two affiliates we have up there, Dr. Wolfe Stations, that still air the broadcast.
[3:15:46.200 --> 3:15:48.200]  But thank you so much, Jason.
[3:15:48.200 --> 3:15:51.200]  Give us your take on what's happening.
[3:15:51.200 --> 3:15:54.200]  They're now rolling out the script exactly as I predicted.
[3:15:54.200 --> 3:15:57.200]  It's not hard to do because they were telling us what they would do.
[3:15:57.200 --> 3:16:02.200]  A thousand times, but I tell you what, my grandfather stormed the beaches of Normandy.
[3:16:02.200 --> 3:16:04.200]  I had an uncle that died in Vietnam.
[3:16:04.200 --> 3:16:07.200]  My brother was a Navy SEAL, serving in Bosnia.
[3:16:07.200 --> 3:16:12.200]  And I'll tell you what, they want to roll that out against American people that they're going to.
[3:16:12.200 --> 3:16:15.200]  That's the worst mistake they could ever make.
[3:16:15.200 --> 3:16:17.200]  Yeah, I mean, there is a disconnect.
[3:16:17.200 --> 3:16:23.200]  The globalists know what they're doing, but George Soros just ratted people out and had them thrown in concentration camps.
[3:16:23.200 --> 3:16:25.200]  He didn't actually do the killing.
[3:16:25.200 --> 3:16:28.200]  And it goes for all these other MSNBC people and all the rest of them.
[3:16:28.200 --> 3:16:36.200]  I mean, they literally, they're not going to get away with what they've done if they cause a civil war in this country.
[3:16:36.200 --> 3:16:40.200]  I will guarantee you, in the end, they are the ones that ought to be worried.
[3:16:40.200 --> 3:16:42.200]  I know they're a bunch of cowards.
[3:16:42.200 --> 3:16:44.200]  Why do you think they don't understand what they're doing?
[3:16:44.200 --> 3:16:46.200]  I guess they haven't studied military history.
[3:16:46.200 --> 3:16:48.200]  They haven't studied asymmetrical warfare.
[3:16:48.200 --> 3:16:50.200]  They haven't studied this country.
[3:16:50.200 --> 3:16:52.200]  I guess they haven't.
[3:16:52.200 --> 3:16:54.200]  I guess they haven't even studied Afghanistan or Iraq.
[3:16:54.200 --> 3:16:59.200]  They're the greatest military power in the world, kind of even locked down those countries.
[3:16:59.200 --> 3:17:03.200]  I mean, what makes them think they're going to be able to lock down America?
[3:17:03.200 --> 3:17:05.200]  What is your family?
[3:17:05.200 --> 3:17:09.200]  What is your Navy cell brother think about all this?
[3:17:09.200 --> 3:17:11.200]  You know what?
[3:17:11.200 --> 3:17:19.200]  He's a little bit skeptical, but you know, every now and again, he'll get a few beers in him and tell me some things that'll make your skin crawl.
[3:17:19.200 --> 3:17:25.200]  I'm not even going to say it over the phone, I don't want to get into trouble or nothing.
[3:17:25.200 --> 3:17:28.200]  What, torturing people, shipping drugs in?
[3:17:28.200 --> 3:17:30.200]  What is it?
[3:17:30.200 --> 3:17:36.200]  Well, kind of more along the lines of like that movie Resident Evil.
[3:17:36.200 --> 3:17:44.200]  He got hurt when he was a still and he had to touch a high security clearance that he did other things, so to speak.
[3:17:44.200 --> 3:17:48.200]  And he could tell you things that'll make your skin crawl.
[3:17:48.200 --> 3:17:52.200]  I know they've got those clone bases and everything else.
[3:17:52.200 --> 3:17:54.200]  Yeah, the public isn't ready to hear all that.
[3:17:54.200 --> 3:17:56.200]  Very interesting. I appreciate your call.
[3:17:56.200 --> 3:18:00.200]  Yeah, cloning's been going on since the Nazis.
[3:18:00.200 --> 3:18:03.200]  That's now declassified rabbits.
[3:18:03.200 --> 3:18:09.200]  Rabbits are the most fertile creature, fertile mammal that we know of.
[3:18:09.200 --> 3:18:14.200]  They've been cloning humans in embryonic form since the 80s.
[3:18:14.200 --> 3:18:16.200]  They always bury it like a footnote.
[3:18:16.200 --> 3:18:25.200]  I remember, we're going to skip this network break and then we'll just go out with the whatever you guys want.
[3:18:25.200 --> 3:18:30.200]  I just want to say this crew for a three hour radio show some days longer is the hardest working folks.
[3:18:30.200 --> 3:18:33.200]  The way they just jump and scramble when I get in my manic mode here on air.
[3:18:33.200 --> 3:18:37.200]  I want to just want to pray for folks, pray for my great crew and salute them.
[3:18:37.200 --> 3:18:38.200]  What a great crew.
[3:18:38.200 --> 3:18:46.200]  The radio crew is in the bunker. They are in the command base and it's like Ender's game.
[3:18:46.200 --> 3:18:52.200]  We're actually engaged in the New World Order and we thought it was all a game the whole time.
[3:18:52.200 --> 3:18:54.200]  Let's go ahead. I appreciate your call.
[3:18:54.200 --> 3:19:01.200]  Let's go ahead. I have to skip this break so I have time to get to all the callers as promised.
[3:19:01.200 --> 3:19:05.200]  The globalists are making the same mistake Napoleon and Hitler made.
[3:19:05.200 --> 3:19:07.200]  Literally starting war with Russia.
[3:19:07.200 --> 3:19:14.200]  But if they think Russia is going to be an issue, the American people kicked the redcoats butt.
[3:19:14.200 --> 3:19:18.200]  I don't care how much mind control you've got, how much propaganda.
[3:19:18.200 --> 3:19:23.200]  It may have 80% of the public caught in its web and I think that's a high number.
[3:19:23.200 --> 3:19:30.200]  You don't have the rest of the people and if people won't change and won't submit and won't roll over in the dirt,
[3:19:30.200 --> 3:19:33.200]  there are a lot of people that aren't scared.
[3:19:33.200 --> 3:19:42.200]  It's beyond being scared. You've got an instinct that my biggest problem, because I'm only like 5'10", 5'11", I'll hunch over as I'm 5'10",
[3:19:42.200 --> 3:19:48.200]  and I am a big guy, I mean I'm muscular, but I'm not like some of these huge guys that are 6'7", 300 pounds,
[3:19:48.200 --> 3:19:55.200]  can bench press 600 pounds and a lot of big guys are nice, but I have this problem like of a big guy.
[3:19:55.200 --> 3:20:00.200]  If I was to push his way past me or treat me like I'm a little guy, I guess you'd call it Napoleonic syndrome.
[3:20:00.200 --> 3:20:06.200]  I say, listen, immediately I want to climb up on top of him and kick their ass.
[3:20:06.200 --> 3:20:13.200]  And it's actually a weakness of mine that I've developed not to be so looking for trouble, because I don't look for fights,
[3:20:13.200 --> 3:20:16.200]  but the worst time is some big guy starts a fight with me, man.
[3:20:16.200 --> 3:20:19.200]  And what it is is it's fight or flight.
[3:20:19.200 --> 3:20:24.200]  And I finally psychologically in the last decade figured out what it is and learned to just control it
[3:20:24.200 --> 3:20:32.200]  and let big guys push me around and stuff, because I got bigger fights to fight, is that it's a fight or flight.
[3:20:32.200 --> 3:20:38.200]  I mean a big guy is pushing me around at a primitive level, my body gears up to go after him.
[3:20:38.200 --> 3:20:46.200]  And most of the time they're not going to win because I'm the little guy and they're in the wrong, I'm cornered.
[3:20:46.200 --> 3:20:51.200]  And it's the same thing with this government, that's why I'm not afraid of them, it's the opposite.
[3:20:51.200 --> 3:20:57.200]  I'm just like, these are bad evil people who hate humanity and my instincts are, let's fight them.
[3:20:57.200 --> 3:21:04.200]  But you don't fight them stupid by going in a grocery store and shooting cops who are probably good people.
[3:21:04.200 --> 3:21:06.200]  Even though they were bad, they deserve a trial.
[3:21:06.200 --> 3:21:11.200]  We don't become the New World Order to fight the New World Order is what I'm trying to get at.
[3:21:11.200 --> 3:21:14.200]  And I really appreciate that last caller, you touched my heart sir, God bless you.
[3:21:14.200 --> 3:21:19.200]  Yeah, there's all sorts of weird experiments going on and just stuff that's off the chart.
[3:21:19.200 --> 3:21:23.200]  And it's industrial level.
[3:21:23.200 --> 3:21:33.200]  I'm not bragging when I say that when in the 80s, it's late 80s, my mom and dad had multiple discussions.
[3:21:33.200 --> 3:21:39.200]  I might have to say, let's talk about it privately and stuff like that with my mom.
[3:21:39.200 --> 3:21:40.200]  So I never even heard all of it.
[3:21:40.200 --> 3:21:47.200]  He won't talk about it today where the CIA tried to hire him because I had some family that did stuff for the CIA
[3:21:47.200 --> 3:21:55.200]  to be inducted in Maryland into literal, below ground basis for a four-year secret tour.
[3:21:55.200 --> 3:21:58.200]  And they were hiring other top dentists that were pioneering implants.
[3:21:58.200 --> 3:22:03.200]  My dad pioneered implants and taught it at medical school and all that.
[3:22:03.200 --> 3:22:08.200]  And it was literally, they just said it's cybernetics, it's highly advanced.
[3:22:08.200 --> 3:22:16.200]  And it was $400,000 a year, way more money than he was making then and he owned dental offices.
[3:22:16.200 --> 3:22:23.200]  And he said no because my dad did work at the medical school.
[3:22:23.200 --> 3:22:28.200]  He was someone who would do medical procedures on high level CIA people.
[3:22:28.200 --> 3:22:32.200]  They would come into him and then they would not allow deadening.
[3:22:32.200 --> 3:22:37.200]  They would have people there watching while he did procedures on people just because they can't be put under.
[3:22:37.200 --> 3:22:39.200]  That was back during the Cold War.
[3:22:39.200 --> 3:22:40.200]  And so my dad did do that.
[3:22:40.200 --> 3:22:42.200]  Probably get mad at me when I'm telling this.
[3:22:42.200 --> 3:22:48.200]  But the whole point is, is that what that guy was talking about, I mean, it's reportedly really bad what's going on now.
[3:22:48.200 --> 3:22:55.200]  I mean, you name it, island of Dr. Maru level stuff, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:22:55.200 --> 3:23:01.200]  And it's just, it's just from what I've been told by high level people, not my dad.
[3:23:01.200 --> 3:23:03.200]  He was just went and interviewed and was told about it.
[3:23:03.200 --> 3:23:12.200]  And it's just, we're not in Kansas is what I'm trying to tell people.
[3:23:12.200 --> 3:23:14.200]  Let's go to GB and Louisiana.
[3:23:14.200 --> 3:23:16.200]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[3:23:16.200 --> 3:23:17.200]  Hey, Alex.
[3:23:17.200 --> 3:23:18.200]  Thanks for taking my call.
[3:23:18.200 --> 3:23:19.200]  You bet.
[3:23:19.200 --> 3:23:20.200]  Welcome.
[3:23:20.200 --> 3:23:32.200]  Hey, I just wanted to let you know that I have taken your advice and I started my own web page aggregating some news trying to wake up my local community.
[3:23:32.200 --> 3:23:43.200]  Down here in New Orleans and doing some man on the street type interviews and the French border just trying to wake up regular folks like me and you.
[3:23:43.200 --> 3:23:44.200]  Well, keep it up.
[3:23:44.200 --> 3:23:47.200]  What do you think about what's going on with the attempt to start the Civil War?
[3:23:47.200 --> 3:23:51.200]  Do you disagree they're trying to do that or what do you think?
[3:23:51.200 --> 3:23:52.200]  No, I agree.
[3:23:52.200 --> 3:23:59.200]  I just, I just completed a citizens Academy with my local sheriff down here.
[3:23:59.200 --> 3:24:09.200]  And I confronted him on the fact that he was reiterating these talking points that you that you've been mentioning.
[3:24:09.200 --> 3:24:23.200]  Over the last, you know, God knows how long about domestic terrorism and how they weren't worried about Al Qaeda anymore and that that they've got to do something because people have died every day.
[3:24:23.200 --> 3:24:26.200]  And I asked him, you know, where?
[3:24:26.200 --> 3:24:32.200]  Who, who like, you know, he was speaking like there was already a war going on.
[3:24:32.200 --> 3:24:37.200]  That's because MSNBC and CNN go there's an epidemic of deep part of your scaling people.
[3:24:37.200 --> 3:24:39.200]  36 in 12 years.
[3:24:39.200 --> 3:24:41.200]  That's three a year.
[3:24:41.200 --> 3:24:45.200]  That's the opposite of an epidemic.
[3:24:45.200 --> 3:24:48.200]  That's less people than great white sharks kill every year.
[3:24:48.200 --> 3:24:49.200]  One of the rarest ways to die.
[3:24:49.200 --> 3:24:51.200]  I mean, my point is no, no, that's the thing.
[3:24:51.200 --> 3:24:52.200]  They've got to do something.
[3:24:52.200 --> 3:24:54.200]  Harry reads on the Senate floor.
[3:24:54.200 --> 3:24:55.200]  We have the club.
[3:24:55.200 --> 3:24:56.200]  God has shut down free speech.
[3:24:56.200 --> 3:24:57.200]  The Tea Party.
[3:24:57.200 --> 3:25:01.200]  I mean, this is outrageous.
[3:25:01.200 --> 3:25:11.200]  I've emailed Kurt Nemo about an article that I'm working on and I've included some audio footage from from what he had to say.
[3:25:11.200 --> 3:25:12.200]  Just a snippet of that.
[3:25:12.200 --> 3:25:14.200]  So who is this that was saying that?
[3:25:14.200 --> 3:25:16.200]  Who is who is telling you this?
[3:25:16.200 --> 3:25:27.200]  This is the, this is the sheriff down here in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, and he's one of the biggest sheriffs because because of the population.
[3:25:27.200 --> 3:25:28.200]  Oh, I know.
[3:25:28.200 --> 3:25:29.200]  I know.
[3:25:29.200 --> 3:25:30.200]  That's the main one.
[3:25:30.200 --> 3:25:32.200]  And he said they got to do something about what?
[3:25:32.200 --> 3:25:36.200]  We have an article with another sheriff saying we got to prepare for war with the veterans because of the epidemic.
[3:25:36.200 --> 3:25:40.200]  It's a talking point and they go out and say there's an epidemic of veterans killing police.
[3:25:40.200 --> 3:25:42.200]  We've got to go after them.
[3:25:42.200 --> 3:25:43.200]  Really?
[3:25:43.200 --> 3:25:44.200]  Where?
[3:25:44.200 --> 3:25:45.200]  Where?
[3:25:45.200 --> 3:25:47.200]  The bigger guy wasn't a veteran.
[3:25:47.200 --> 3:25:53.200]  I mean, he's saying he's saying they got a gear up for who?
[3:25:53.200 --> 3:26:06.200]  He was saying that people are dying every day because of domestic terrorism and that that he wasn't worried about al-Qaeda anymore.
[3:26:06.200 --> 3:26:14.200]  I have to finish listening to the audio because it was been a couple of weeks since I completed the class and I've been working on my way.
[3:26:14.200 --> 3:26:16.200]  Well, I want to put you on hold.
[3:26:16.200 --> 3:26:21.200]  I want to give you to our reporters, Adon Salazar, Curtin Emma, whoever it is you want to talk to.
[3:26:21.200 --> 3:26:26.200]  That is a powerful article that we need to put out that they're teaching that in classes.
[3:26:26.200 --> 3:26:32.200]  I mean, that's the official rollout that the Tea Party is the new al-Qaeda and Alex Jones is his leader.
[3:26:32.200 --> 3:26:35.200]  I'm basically the new Osama bin Laden.
[3:26:35.200 --> 3:26:37.200]  I mean, let's just get it straight here.
[3:26:37.200 --> 3:26:43.200]  And you know, you wake up in the morning and you discover that you're being blamed for cop killings and you're the new terror leader.
[3:26:43.200 --> 3:26:44.200]  It's weird.
[3:26:44.200 --> 3:26:46.200]  That's all I can say.
[3:26:46.200 --> 3:26:49.200]  My life is officially twilight zone level.
[3:26:49.200 --> 3:26:51.200]  Sir, I'm going to put you on hold.
[3:26:51.200 --> 3:26:54.200]  Are you in college or high school?
[3:26:54.200 --> 3:26:56.200]  What type of class was this?
[3:26:56.200 --> 3:26:59.200]  No, I've completed college.
[3:26:59.200 --> 3:27:05.200]  I'm a professional and this is a citizens academy sponsored by the Sheriff's office.
[3:27:05.200 --> 3:27:09.200]  So basically, I guess it's a PR type.
[3:27:09.200 --> 3:27:10.200]  Oh, I got it.
[3:27:10.200 --> 3:27:11.200]  That's amazing.
[3:27:11.200 --> 3:27:20.200]  So citizens, citizens being taught the share of teacher citizens, citizen snitch classes, share of teacher citizens and snitch classes.
[3:27:20.200 --> 3:27:22.200]  How do you put a headline on it?
[3:27:22.200 --> 3:27:26.200]  Law enforcement snitch class says watch your neighbor or says Tea Party is the terrorist.
[3:27:26.200 --> 3:27:29.200]  You think that's a fair headline?
[3:27:29.200 --> 3:27:39.200]  Well, yeah, it's something like that, but it's not just that because I got him on audio saying that he wishes he could have the FFL certificates as well.
[3:27:39.200 --> 3:27:49.200]  And I'm sure the people of Louisiana wouldn't appreciate that their, you know, gun love and sheriff would want to have a registration.
[3:27:49.200 --> 3:27:50.200]  Wait a minute.
[3:27:50.200 --> 3:27:52.200]  The sheriff wants to get your guns registered?
[3:27:52.200 --> 3:27:54.200]  You're kidding.
[3:27:54.200 --> 3:27:55.200]  I've got it.
[3:27:55.200 --> 3:27:56.200]  I've got it on audio.
[3:27:56.200 --> 3:27:57.200]  By the way, we've got it up.
[3:27:57.200 --> 3:28:02.200]  It says Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office Safety Citizens Academy Guidelines.
[3:28:02.200 --> 3:28:05.200]  See, folks, you don't want to just sit in a bunker getting guns ready.
[3:28:05.200 --> 3:28:12.200]  You want to go to all these events, you want to get intel for America and expose all these people that are teaching Creason.
[3:28:12.200 --> 3:28:13.200]  God bless you, brother.
[3:28:13.200 --> 3:28:14.200]  I really want to hear that.
[3:28:14.200 --> 3:28:15.200]  Thank you so much.
[3:28:15.200 --> 3:28:18.200]  Lee and Georgia, thanks for holding your on the air.
[3:28:18.200 --> 3:28:23.200]  Hey, Alex, I met you once before at the Dallas Fed rally.
[3:28:23.200 --> 3:28:24.200]  Yes, sir, brother.
[3:28:24.200 --> 3:28:29.200]  About the children that they are shipping into the country.
[3:28:29.200 --> 3:28:34.200]  All these immigrants, they're legal immigrants and how are they getting in here?
[3:28:34.200 --> 3:28:37.200]  No, it's in the local news.
[3:28:37.200 --> 3:28:44.200]  Parents put their kids on planes, they land, and customs has been told, take the children, give them lawyers, give them to Obama.
[3:28:44.200 --> 3:28:50.200]  They're Obama's cult children to be used as a political pawn now and say, you must legalize them.
[3:28:50.200 --> 3:28:52.200]  Look at little Felipe.
[3:28:52.200 --> 3:28:55.200]  He's your responsibility, I mean, literally.
[3:28:55.200 --> 3:29:04.200]  Well, it just set my spending expenses off, you know, because it seems to me like, you know, they're storing them at military bases now and all this stuff.
[3:29:04.200 --> 3:29:07.200]  Like, what if they're going to use them as child soldiers at a point?
[3:29:07.200 --> 3:29:08.200]  Well, they say they're being abused.
[3:29:08.200 --> 3:29:09.200]  I mean, I don't know.
[3:29:09.200 --> 3:29:17.200]  Look, Oliver North wanted to use rounding up immigrants in an immigrant wave as a cover to build FEMA camps.
[3:29:17.200 --> 3:29:23.200]  And again, everybody used to military holding large groups of non-criminal populations.
[3:29:23.200 --> 3:29:26.200]  That's called Rex 84, that's declassified.
[3:29:26.200 --> 3:29:29.200]  So, yeah, that could be it, brother. Great points.
[3:29:29.200 --> 3:29:32.200]  I'm sorry to Greg in North Carolina.
[3:29:32.200 --> 3:29:34.200]  No, no, we're going to continue overdrive.
[3:29:34.200 --> 3:29:41.200]  We'll come back with a fixed bayonets clip, and then we'll go to Jeff and Mark and everybody else straight ahead.
[3:29:41.200 --> 3:29:44.200]  We've got a Jakari Jackson intro as well we're going to play.
[3:29:44.200 --> 3:29:47.200]  Let's play the Jakari Jackson Club when we come back.
[3:29:47.200 --> 3:29:49.200]  We're just going to keep going, stay with us.
[3:29:49.200 --> 3:29:53.200]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[3:29:53.200 --> 3:30:19.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:19.200 --> 3:30:32.200]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere, and that's what prisonplanet.tv is designed to do.
[3:30:32.200 --> 3:30:40.200]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[3:30:40.200 --> 3:30:44.200]  What we see now is a war against reality, it's a war against the truth.
[3:30:44.200 --> 3:30:52.200]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of prisonplanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[3:30:52.200 --> 3:30:55.200]  Visit infowarsnews.com today.
[3:30:55.200 --> 3:31:00.200]  Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war to the next level.
[3:31:00.200 --> 3:31:05.200]  How long would you last if all grocery stores ceased to exist?
[3:31:05.200 --> 3:31:08.200]  Not in America, this can't happen in America.
[3:31:08.200 --> 3:31:12.200]  Because of my concern about our government, I was looking at your rival stuff.
[3:31:12.200 --> 3:31:15.200]  I was raised as a girl scout and their motto was to be prepared.
[3:31:15.200 --> 3:31:21.200]  Food for patriots was an opportunity for me to be able to put some things aside.
[3:31:21.200 --> 3:31:25.200]  I said, well, this is a product worth having, being as it's so good.
[3:31:25.200 --> 3:31:30.200]  I like the pricing for what I got, I like the containers they were shipped in.
[3:31:30.200 --> 3:31:34.200]  If they keep in touch with you, you get your emails, you get your confirmation.
[3:31:34.200 --> 3:31:38.200]  Customer services, just absolutely fantastic.
[3:31:38.200 --> 3:31:42.200]  I plan on buying probably about four more of these minimum.
[3:31:42.200 --> 3:31:45.200]  And it just came so quick, it came right when they said it was top.
[3:31:45.200 --> 3:31:51.200]  Thanks for supplying all this stuff for us, because I think we're all going to be needing it in a very short time.
[3:31:51.200 --> 3:31:55.200]  Join over 50,000 Americans who have trusted food for patriots.
[3:31:55.200 --> 3:31:58.200]  Go to GetSurvivalFood.com to learn more.
[3:31:58.200 --> 3:32:00.200]  That's GetSurvivalFood.com.
[3:32:00.200 --> 3:32:02.200]  So we decided to upgrade the look of our home.
[3:32:02.200 --> 3:32:04.200]  You know, improve the curve appeal.
[3:32:04.200 --> 3:32:07.200]  We decided to add the look of stone to the exterior.
[3:32:07.200 --> 3:32:09.200]  We really like the stacked stone look.
[3:32:09.200 --> 3:32:12.200]  Yeah, but when I checked into the price, it was ridiculous.
[3:32:12.200 --> 3:32:13.200]  No way could we afford it.
[3:32:13.200 --> 3:32:15.200]  Then a friend told me about Genstone.
[3:32:15.200 --> 3:32:18.200]  G-E-N-S-T-O-N-E.
[3:32:18.200 --> 3:32:21.200]  Genstone comes in lightweight panels made of polyurethane.
[3:32:21.200 --> 3:32:24.200]  They've actually engineered the hassle out of installation.
[3:32:24.200 --> 3:32:26.200]  No mortar, no mesh, it was easy.
[3:32:26.200 --> 3:32:27.200]  Even I could do it.
[3:32:27.200 --> 3:32:30.200]  We just screwed the panels to the wall and it looks like stone.
[3:32:30.200 --> 3:32:32.200]  I mean, it really looks like stone.
[3:32:32.200 --> 3:32:34.200]  Yeah, from the box to the wall in minutes.
[3:32:34.200 --> 3:32:36.200]  We love the look of our home now.
[3:32:36.200 --> 3:32:39.200]  And Genstone is durable, comes with a 25-year warranty
[3:32:39.200 --> 3:32:42.200]  and offers additional R value for installation.
[3:32:42.200 --> 3:32:45.200]  If you want the look of stone at a price you can afford,
[3:32:45.200 --> 3:32:49.200]  call Genstone at 855-955-STONE.
[3:32:49.200 --> 3:32:51.200]  Trust me, you'll save money.
[3:32:51.200 --> 3:32:53.200]  And you'll love the look.
[3:32:53.200 --> 3:32:55.200]  855-955-STONE.
[3:32:55.200 --> 3:33:12.200]  That's 855-955-7866.
[3:33:12.200 --> 3:33:13.200]  Fix bayonets.
[3:33:13.200 --> 3:33:16.200]  We are now entering overdrive.
[3:33:16.200 --> 3:33:21.200]  With your host, Alex Jones broadcasting live from the front lines.
[3:33:21.200 --> 3:33:23.200]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[3:33:23.200 --> 3:33:27.200]  you are the resistance.
[3:33:45.200 --> 3:33:49.200]  No weapons of mass destruction were found.
[3:33:49.200 --> 3:33:51.200]  Are you kidding me? Do you buy that?
[3:33:51.200 --> 3:33:54.200]  There were, there were, there were.
[3:33:54.200 --> 3:33:57.200]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:33:58.200 --> 3:34:00.200]  I was five and he was six.
[3:34:00.200 --> 3:34:04.200]  We rode on horses made of sticks.
[3:34:04.200 --> 3:34:07.200]  He wore black and I wore white.
[3:34:07.200 --> 3:34:08.200]  Come on, let's just shoot.
[3:34:08.200 --> 3:34:10.200]  Player, hooray.
[3:34:13.200 --> 3:34:15.200]  Hey, I need to get the ramp, to drive ramps.
[3:34:15.200 --> 3:34:17.200]  I got a wounded girl.
[3:34:17.200 --> 3:34:18.200]  Will you take the rustle mile?
[3:34:18.200 --> 3:34:26.200]  The main reason we went into Iraq at the time was we thought he had weapons of mass destruction.
[3:34:26.200 --> 3:34:29.200]  It turns out he didn't, but he had the capacity to make weapons of mass destruction.
[3:34:29.200 --> 3:34:32.200]  But I also talked about the human suffering in Iraq.
[3:34:32.200 --> 3:34:38.200]  Hello, boys and girls. I have a special message for you from the President of the United States.
[3:34:38.200 --> 3:34:43.200]  I salute the boys and girls who are buying United States savings, stamps and bonds,
[3:34:43.200 --> 3:34:49.200]  and they're giving important support to the cause of freedom and the men who fight for us in Vietnam.
[3:34:49.200 --> 3:34:59.200]  The Congress gave us this authority in August 1964 to do whatever may be necessary.
[3:34:59.200 --> 3:35:03.200]  That's pretty far-reaching. That's the sky of the limits.
[3:35:03.200 --> 3:35:07.200]  As an American citizen, you have to respect our President whether I like it or not.
[3:35:07.200 --> 3:35:14.200]  It's really not my decision, but I do respect my President and I will support whatever decision he makes.
[3:35:14.200 --> 3:35:33.200]  It is a hard fact that U.S. strikes have resulted in civilian casualties.
[3:35:33.200 --> 3:35:43.200]  Now he's gone, I don't know why, until this day sometimes I cry.
[3:35:43.200 --> 3:35:48.200]  He didn't even say goodbye, he didn't take the time to lie.
[3:35:48.200 --> 3:35:53.200]  The United States knows that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.
[3:35:53.200 --> 3:35:57.200]  One of the first things they told me was, you're not even to acknowledge the drone program.
[3:35:57.200 --> 3:36:00.200]  You're not even to discuss that it exists.
[3:36:00.200 --> 3:36:08.200]  Renewed hostile actions against United States ships on the high seas and the Gulf of Tonkin
[3:36:08.200 --> 3:36:17.200]  have today required me to order the military forces of the United States to take action and reply.
[3:36:17.200 --> 3:36:20.200]  That reply is being killed.
[3:36:28.200 --> 3:36:34.200]  Well, Jakari Jackson is quite the artiste when it comes to video presentations, very touching.
[3:36:34.200 --> 3:36:39.200]  I guess he wants to give Darren McBreen a run for his money around here.
[3:36:39.200 --> 3:36:42.200]  Rob Jacobson or Josh Owens or Rob Do.
[3:36:42.200 --> 3:36:44.200]  What an incredible team.
[3:36:44.200 --> 3:36:47.200]  Marcos Morales, we just have such a great team.
[3:36:47.200 --> 3:36:50.200]  I didn't even list them all when it comes to video.
[3:36:50.200 --> 3:36:55.200]  But they all love Liberty and it's such a blessing to build a team like this.
[3:36:55.200 --> 3:37:02.200]  The feds have been here before when I was going to release the Obama deception, asking about it.
[3:37:02.200 --> 3:37:07.200]  But they gave me a gag order so I couldn't say why they were here.
[3:37:07.200 --> 3:37:09.200]  I could have fought it.
[3:37:09.200 --> 3:37:16.200]  People then, the usual suspects said it was a lie, the FBI wasn't here and of course it later came out in the Associated Press.
[3:37:16.200 --> 3:37:17.200]  They weren't.
[3:37:17.200 --> 3:37:22.200]  About a year later when the gag order was lifted, reporters got ahold of it.
[3:37:22.200 --> 3:37:34.200]  I am not a Liberty to talk about it, and I guess this will probably happen with more people, but the FBI is visiting DHS,
[3:37:34.200 --> 3:37:45.200]  the overarching DHS, is visiting people without warrants who are contributors to the InfoWars Network and asking questions about me.
[3:37:45.200 --> 3:37:50.200]  In a case in California and it's an ongoing thing.
[3:37:50.200 --> 3:37:54.200]  So it's just pure intimidation and it doesn't intimidate anybody.
[3:37:54.200 --> 3:38:01.200]  In fact, I was tired today a couple hours in the show, but I just did overdrive because of this.
[3:38:01.200 --> 3:38:06.200]  And I think I'm going to shoot a couple special reports tonight now and maybe I'll just stay up here until two in the morning.
[3:38:06.200 --> 3:38:16.200]  Because that's my rule, is that people censor us, we double down.
[3:38:16.200 --> 3:38:20.200]  People try to shut us down, we get louder.
[3:38:20.200 --> 3:38:25.200]  Somebody punches me in the face, I punch him back twice.
[3:38:25.200 --> 3:38:32.200]  And the President of the United States is not our president, he is a lawless criminal.
[3:38:32.200 --> 3:38:40.200]  I am an American being raped by the private Federal Reserve, raped by Obamacare, raped by their GMO,
[3:38:40.200 --> 3:38:48.200]  raped by them funding Al Qaeda with my tax money to kill 300,000 mainly Christians in Egypt, Libya and Syria.
[3:38:48.200 --> 3:38:56.200]  And I have a right to not be your slave, I have a right to not be urinated on by you and your minions who hate me.
[3:38:56.200 --> 3:39:04.200]  Well, you fly around in your jets and your red carpets telling poor Africans they can't have air conditioning or a car because they're bad, they should feel guilty.
[3:39:04.200 --> 3:39:09.200]  A, you don't understand science, but you do, you want them to be poor and accept being poor.
[3:39:09.200 --> 3:39:14.200]  But if you did believe that crap, you wouldn't be such a giant consumer.
[3:39:14.200 --> 3:39:20.200]  Like all you hypocrites, you people are a bunch of criminal con artists with fancy PR,
[3:39:20.200 --> 3:39:27.200]  but what happens when people don't buy your fancy PR no matter how much perfume you put on it?
[3:39:27.200 --> 3:39:30.200]  It's still a hog.
[3:39:30.200 --> 3:39:35.200]  A big, ugly, rotting, stinking carcass of a hog.
[3:39:35.200 --> 3:39:38.200]  And here's the news, you can demonize me all day long.
[3:39:38.200 --> 3:39:42.200]  People want off the New World War train, people don't like where it's going.
[3:39:42.200 --> 3:39:46.200]  You can try to stir up race wars all day.
[3:39:46.200 --> 3:39:51.200]  You can try to stir up fights between the sexes and religious fights.
[3:39:51.200 --> 3:39:53.200]  You can fund destabilization all over the world.
[3:39:53.200 --> 3:40:00.200]  You can say our veterans are crap and cut off their VA care and try to euthanize them or scyop them and tell them they're mentally ill and try to put them on drugs.
[3:40:00.200 --> 3:40:02.200]  They're waking up.
[3:40:02.200 --> 3:40:05.200]  And you evil doers, and that's what they are.
[3:40:05.200 --> 3:40:07.200]  They love doing evil.
[3:40:07.200 --> 3:40:09.200]  They love inventing evil.
[3:40:09.200 --> 3:40:13.200]  They want to teach kids 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[3:40:13.200 --> 3:40:17.200]  Because they've got to grow up in a world where I say, don't kill police.
[3:40:17.200 --> 3:40:21.200]  Don't be violent.
[3:40:21.200 --> 3:40:24.200]  And then they say, I'm causing people to kill police.
[3:40:24.200 --> 3:40:27.200]  That's 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[3:40:27.200 --> 3:40:30.200]  No, it equals 4, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:40:30.200 --> 3:40:32.200]  2 plus 2 equals 4.
[3:40:32.200 --> 3:40:34.200]  2 plus 2 equals 4.
[3:40:34.200 --> 3:40:37.200]  2 plus 2 equals 4.
[3:40:37.200 --> 3:40:40.200]  2 plus 2 equals 4.
[3:40:40.200 --> 3:40:42.200]  2 plus 2 equals 4.
[3:40:42.200 --> 3:40:47.200]  They hate that.
[3:40:47.200 --> 3:40:52.200]  It's like Bill Murray and Gus Pussies where he's tapping on the piano and he goes, oh, they hate that.
[3:40:52.200 --> 3:40:53.200]  That's a joke.
[3:40:53.200 --> 3:40:56.200]  I'm not joking when I say they hate that.
[3:40:56.200 --> 3:41:02.200]  These bogies, these boobies, booby doesn't mean an idiot like you think.
[3:41:02.200 --> 3:41:03.200]  That's the popular parlance.
[3:41:03.200 --> 3:41:09.200]  It means a pirate, a China sea pirate.
[3:41:09.200 --> 3:41:15.200]  And the globalists are beyond boobies.
[3:41:15.200 --> 3:41:21.200]  Your classic pirates of the world were just robbing other merchant navies that were pirates in their own right in many cases.
[3:41:21.200 --> 3:41:25.200]  It was men against men.
[3:41:25.200 --> 3:41:29.200]  You could admire pirates to a certain extent if you actually study them.
[3:41:29.200 --> 3:41:33.200]  Some of the pirates, pirates of the Caribbean, things like that.
[3:41:33.200 --> 3:41:40.200]  But I will tell you right now, I do not admire the pirates that run Skull and Bones and the pirates that run MSNBC.
[3:41:40.200 --> 3:41:42.200]  They are despicable people.
[3:41:42.200 --> 3:41:45.200]  They don't have a passion and a love for women.
[3:41:45.200 --> 3:41:48.200]  They don't have a passion and love for art.
[3:41:48.200 --> 3:41:54.200]  Or what they do have a love for is ugliness and lies and fraud and stench.
[3:41:54.200 --> 3:41:59.200]  And they want to turn everybody's productivity off so they can squat on what's left of it and dole it out.
[3:41:59.200 --> 3:42:03.200]  They want to tell everybody what to do.
[3:42:03.200 --> 3:42:07.200]  And I am set against them forever.
[3:42:07.200 --> 3:42:14.200]  And this show is a testament to the ragtag nature of liberty and the fact that it's got them all up in a dander.
[3:42:14.200 --> 3:42:17.200]  We have a bigger audience than Pathetic MSNBC.
[3:42:17.200 --> 3:42:19.200]  CNN is a shadow of itself.
[3:42:19.200 --> 3:42:20.200]  You people are pathetic.
[3:42:20.200 --> 3:42:25.200]  So just keep saying I'm a terrorist or deeply racist or behind the Boston bombing.
[3:42:25.200 --> 3:42:27.200]  I was born in 1974.
[3:42:27.200 --> 3:42:31.200]  Maybe I was a cop with shot in 73.
[3:42:31.200 --> 3:42:34.200]  Maybe I did that too before I was born.
[3:42:34.200 --> 3:42:36.200]  Why are they demonizing us?
[3:42:36.200 --> 3:42:38.200]  Because they're scared.
[3:42:38.200 --> 3:42:40.200]  Let's go to your calls.
[3:42:40.200 --> 3:42:41.200]  Greg in North Carolina.
[3:42:41.200 --> 3:42:42.200]  Greg, you're on the air.
[3:42:42.200 --> 3:42:43.200]  Go ahead.
[3:42:43.200 --> 3:42:46.200]  Hey, Alex, I'll be brave because I know you're pressed.
[3:42:46.200 --> 3:42:47.200]  No, no, I got time.
[3:42:47.200 --> 3:42:48.200]  We don't go to break for a while.
[3:42:48.200 --> 3:42:49.200]  Go ahead.
[3:42:49.200 --> 3:42:51.200]  I have a lot of time to do research.
[3:42:51.200 --> 3:42:58.200]  And I came across a really interesting tidbit that I'm really surprised that the mainstream media has not picked up on this.
[3:42:58.200 --> 3:43:06.200]  But it appears, Alex, that you had something to do with the Hindenburg disaster in 1937.
[3:43:06.200 --> 3:43:10.200]  I just want to know what you have to say for yourself, young man.
[3:43:10.200 --> 3:43:13.200]  Well, I'm against blimps being filled with hydrogen.
[3:43:13.200 --> 3:43:16.200]  I think passenger blimps should not be filled with hydrogen.
[3:43:16.200 --> 3:43:18.200]  They should be filled with helium.
[3:43:18.200 --> 3:43:25.200]  I apologize for the death and the loss, but I wasn't involved.
[3:43:25.200 --> 3:43:28.200]  Well, you know, the Titanic didn't really hit an iceberg.
[3:43:28.200 --> 3:43:30.200]  And I know it blew up midstream.
[3:43:30.200 --> 3:43:33.200]  And I hear that you had something to do with that as well.
[3:43:33.200 --> 3:43:39.200]  Well, I'm sorry for the loss of lives there, but I wasn't involved, I promise.
[3:43:39.200 --> 3:43:41.200]  Take care, Alex.
[3:43:41.200 --> 3:43:43.200]  Thank you for calling.
[3:43:43.200 --> 3:43:45.200]  I got something like Porter Stansbury.
[3:43:45.200 --> 3:43:48.200]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in New Mexico.
[3:43:48.200 --> 3:43:50.200]  Mark, you're on the air.
[3:43:50.200 --> 3:43:51.200]  Yeah, Alex.
[3:43:51.200 --> 3:43:56.200]  I finally got to the telephone to talk to you after all these years I've been listening to you, man.
[3:43:56.200 --> 3:43:57.200]  You sound like a character.
[3:43:57.200 --> 3:43:59.200]  Well, I guess I am.
[3:43:59.200 --> 3:44:03.200]  I'm an ex-air force pilot in a Vietnam vet.
[3:44:03.200 --> 3:44:06.200]  And I can tell you stories.
[3:44:06.200 --> 3:44:13.200]  I've never really talked to you, but I decided today something said try to get in and I did.
[3:44:13.200 --> 3:44:15.200]  So, so here I am.
[3:44:15.200 --> 3:44:17.200]  Well, I want to say what I always say to people.
[3:44:17.200 --> 3:44:18.200]  Thank you for putting up with me.
[3:44:18.200 --> 3:44:19.200]  Go ahead.
[3:44:19.200 --> 3:44:22.200]  Yeah, well, Alex, I want to tell you something, pal.
[3:44:22.200 --> 3:44:24.200]  I'm quite a bit older than you.
[3:44:24.200 --> 3:44:27.200]  I'm 75 years old.
[3:44:27.200 --> 3:44:31.200]  I was around for Vietnam, all of that mess and all the rest of it.
[3:44:31.200 --> 3:44:33.200]  In the Air Force, the time flying.
[3:44:33.200 --> 3:44:35.200]  I've flown all my life.
[3:44:35.200 --> 3:44:36.200]  That's all I've ever done.
[3:44:36.200 --> 3:44:39.200]  I'm a test pilot, ex-test pilot, a whole nine yards.
[3:44:39.200 --> 3:44:42.200]  And I have been around the horn.
[3:44:42.200 --> 3:44:44.200]  And I mean, I've been around the horn.
[3:44:44.200 --> 3:44:50.200]  A lot of the stuff you read about and hear about sometimes I was even involved in.
[3:44:50.200 --> 3:44:54.200]  So I didn't just get out of the fall of the wagon is what I'm trying to say.
[3:44:54.200 --> 3:44:57.200]  You didn't just fall off a pumpkin truck.
[3:44:57.200 --> 3:44:59.200]  You got it.
[3:44:59.200 --> 3:45:01.200]  In fact, they had me picking the pumpkins.
[3:45:01.200 --> 3:45:09.200]  Anyway, what I called you about, I just want to encourage you, brother, and you are my brother, pal.
[3:45:09.200 --> 3:45:12.200]  Let me tell you, you are my brother.
[3:45:12.200 --> 3:45:18.200]  This country, my God, I hope the people wake up.
[3:45:18.200 --> 3:45:19.200]  They've got to wake up.
[3:45:19.200 --> 3:45:22.200]  They're not going to be a country if they keep going the way they're going.
[3:45:22.200 --> 3:45:24.200]  This cannot stand.
[3:45:24.200 --> 3:45:26.200]  They put a man in the presidency.
[3:45:26.200 --> 3:45:30.200]  They can't even legally be the president.
[3:45:30.200 --> 3:45:32.200]  I don't even want to get on that subject.
[3:45:32.200 --> 3:45:38.200]  But this is how bad we have slid backwards and we're still sledding backwards.
[3:45:38.200 --> 3:45:42.200]  The things that you're giving them, thank God you're there, Alex.
[3:45:42.200 --> 3:45:46.200]  I could never talk, but you can talk, man.
[3:45:46.200 --> 3:45:51.200]  Give it to them before we're actually shooting at each other.
[3:45:51.200 --> 3:45:58.200]  At my age, I hate to think I'm going to have to drag a rifle off the wall one these days.
[3:45:58.200 --> 3:46:00.200]  It could happen.
[3:46:00.200 --> 3:46:03.200]  I'm not going to give into this.
[3:46:03.200 --> 3:46:05.200]  I've listened to you for years, man.
[3:46:05.200 --> 3:46:08.200]  I mean, way back there.
[3:46:08.200 --> 3:46:12.200]  And put them back to John Stettmiller's first time I ever heard of you.
[3:46:12.200 --> 3:46:13.200]  Oh, yeah.
[3:46:13.200 --> 3:46:15.200]  John's still doing a good job with this show.
[3:46:15.200 --> 3:46:16.200]  Well, listen, I want to tell you something.
[3:46:16.200 --> 3:46:21.200]  We've got a project where when I hear iconic voices, we're going to have them do voiceovers
[3:46:21.200 --> 3:46:25.200]  like Scottish John, who's an Austin listener and I've known him for about 15 years,
[3:46:25.200 --> 3:46:27.200]  running into him at pro-gun demonstrations.
[3:46:27.200 --> 3:46:32.200]  And we pay Scottish John for doing that ad even though he didn't want money.
[3:46:32.200 --> 3:46:34.200]  Your voice right over the phone.
[3:46:34.200 --> 3:46:36.200]  We're going to do some good ads and promos.
[3:46:36.200 --> 3:46:38.200]  So if you want to give us your name and number, I'm going to start this project.
[3:46:38.200 --> 3:46:44.200]  So it's not just my voice all day with the ads or promos or even famous quotes of founders.
[3:46:44.200 --> 3:46:47.200]  I want to start including that on the nightly news every night.
[3:46:47.200 --> 3:46:49.200]  So maybe once a week you could record on tape recorder.
[3:46:49.200 --> 3:46:52.200]  We sent you that and mail it back to us if you're not technical.
[3:46:52.200 --> 3:46:57.200]  But I'd like to have you do some voiceovers because you've got an iconic...
[3:46:57.200 --> 3:46:58.200]  It sounds like a Texas accent.
[3:46:58.200 --> 3:47:00.200]  Are you from New Mexico or Texas?
[3:47:00.200 --> 3:47:03.200]  Born, raised, Corpus Christi, Texas.
[3:47:03.200 --> 3:47:04.200]  Well, listen.
[3:47:04.200 --> 3:47:06.200]  All families all buried down there.
[3:47:06.200 --> 3:47:08.200]  Everybody, I've got a wife.
[3:47:08.200 --> 3:47:10.200]  We've been married for a lot of years.
[3:47:10.200 --> 3:47:12.200]  She's a school teacher.
[3:47:12.200 --> 3:47:15.200]  And like I said, I still...
[3:47:15.200 --> 3:47:20.200]  The last job I was on that I've done, the Chips and Flight Simulator.
[3:47:20.200 --> 3:47:23.200]  I'm the guy that did all the work for MDM on that.
[3:47:23.200 --> 3:47:28.200]  So guys that don't like that, they can blame me for it.
[3:47:28.200 --> 3:47:34.200]  I did literally all the flight work for MDM and then they sold it to Chips and the program.
[3:47:34.200 --> 3:47:38.200]  They also did a command engine program and I did that also.
[3:47:38.200 --> 3:47:44.200]  But I've got thousands and thousands and thousands hours flying airplanes.
[3:47:44.200 --> 3:47:45.200]  Well, that's amazing.
[3:47:45.200 --> 3:47:46.200]  We want to talk to you again.
[3:47:46.200 --> 3:47:48.200]  Give us your name and number if you want to do some voiceovers for us.
[3:47:48.200 --> 3:47:49.200]  All right?
[3:47:49.200 --> 3:47:50.200]  Yeah, sure.
[3:47:50.200 --> 3:47:51.200]  Anytime.
[3:47:51.200 --> 3:47:53.200]  Guys, give us your name and number right now, John Harmon.
[3:47:53.200 --> 3:47:54.200]  Thank you.
[3:47:54.200 --> 3:47:55.200]  Don't hang up.
[3:47:55.200 --> 3:47:56.200]  All right.
[3:47:56.200 --> 3:47:57.200]  That was a very interesting caller.
[3:47:57.200 --> 3:47:59.200]  What was his name again?
[3:47:59.200 --> 3:48:01.200]  Mark of New Mexico.
[3:48:01.200 --> 3:48:03.200]  Yeah, just hearing his voice at first.
[3:48:03.200 --> 3:48:04.200]  It was really interesting.
[3:48:04.200 --> 3:48:09.200]  I feel sorry for folks having to hear my raspy voice all day and half the time I'm gibbering and jabbering.
[3:48:09.200 --> 3:48:11.200]  That's why I don't like compliments.
[3:48:11.200 --> 3:48:17.200]  It's because this is such a big job and I can't even listen to my own show half the time when I hear a rebroadcast.
[3:48:17.200 --> 3:48:20.200]  I mean, I sound like an obnoxious, you know, nut bag sometimes.
[3:48:20.200 --> 3:48:25.200]  But it's because I'm reporting on what's going on that is crazy.
[3:48:25.200 --> 3:48:27.200]  But I'm not crazy.
[3:48:27.200 --> 3:48:29.200]  The world is just weird.
[3:48:29.200 --> 3:48:31.200]  It's weird.
[3:48:31.200 --> 3:48:46.200]  And by the way, folks, if you want to do voiceovers for us, do audio clips and send them to say show tips at info wars.com or maybe audio at info wars, create that email audio at info wars or how about voice at info wars?
[3:48:46.200 --> 3:48:51.200]  That'll be the email voice at info wars will create that email.
[3:48:51.200 --> 3:48:56.200]  And if you think you got a voice that we could use, don't feel bad if we don't contact you.
[3:48:56.200 --> 3:49:00.200]  Send an audio file there because quite frankly, I'm sick of hearing my voice.
[3:49:00.200 --> 3:49:05.200]  We're looking at replacing pretty much most of the voiceovers with other people, not me.
[3:49:05.200 --> 3:49:10.200]  But I want original voices, not the classic radio voice of, hey, everybody, it's sunny outside.
[3:49:10.200 --> 3:49:12.200]  And I don't try to sound like a radio guy.
[3:49:12.200 --> 3:49:14.200]  I've got a blasted blown out voice.
[3:49:14.200 --> 3:49:15.200]  That's why it sounds like this.
[3:49:15.200 --> 3:49:21.200]  At the time I'm so wound up, it's unlistable, but it's very humbling to hear old guys like that having confidence in me.
[3:49:21.200 --> 3:49:25.200]  You know, I just know all these great people.
[3:49:25.200 --> 3:49:38.200]  I don't like World Road Bull Riding Champions and I know, you know, test pilots and I know, you know, just amazing people who are big fans of this show.
[3:49:38.200 --> 3:49:41.200]  I know Chuck Yeager is a listener, but then his lawyers got a hold of him.
[3:49:41.200 --> 3:49:45.200]  He's about to come on and wouldn't let him come on, which is wrong.
[3:49:45.200 --> 3:49:47.200]  I should be able to get Chuck Yeager on.
[3:49:47.200 --> 3:49:53.200]  We ended up getting contacted by his people, but then, you know, then his lawyer contacted us.
[3:49:53.200 --> 3:49:55.200]  Well, we don't think now is the time, blah, blah, blah.
[3:49:55.200 --> 3:49:59.200]  So it's just, I mean, I really, people go, Chuck Yeager, who's Chuck Yeager?
[3:49:59.200 --> 3:50:01.200]  The average person would even know Chuck Yeager is.
[3:50:01.200 --> 3:50:06.200]  And I think that shows why this country is so screwed up.
[3:50:06.200 --> 3:50:10.200]  That's a guy from West Virginia right there.
[3:50:10.200 --> 3:50:16.200]  I would interview Chuck Yeager just about like the 50-something Nazi airplanes he shot down, stuff like that.
[3:50:16.200 --> 3:50:20.200]  That's a guy like from my grandfather's generation, a living fossil who still jumps out of airplanes.
[3:50:20.200 --> 3:50:21.200]  I'm out of, you know what?
[3:50:21.200 --> 3:50:22.200]  Let's just do the whole hour.
[3:50:22.200 --> 3:50:29.200]  I will shut up when we come back and go to Jeff and let me see who else.
[3:50:29.200 --> 3:50:36.200]  Julian and a few others that have been holding the longest, but that's all I can get to is Jeff and Julian and maybe Crazy Horse.
[3:50:36.200 --> 3:50:39.200]  You got to go to Crazy Horse.
[3:50:39.200 --> 3:50:49.200]  But just today, Homeland Security visited one of our auxiliary reporters, a fellow that's done some work for us, asking about me.
[3:50:49.200 --> 3:50:50.200]  And I'm proud of him.
[3:50:50.200 --> 3:50:52.200]  He said, you don't have a warrant.
[3:50:52.200 --> 3:50:54.200]  Get off my property.
[3:50:54.200 --> 3:50:57.200]  I'm not talking to you.

[3:54:19.800 --> 3:54:25.360]  There is a war.
[3:54:25.360 --> 3:54:27.160]  It's happening now.
[3:54:27.160 --> 3:54:29.520]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[3:54:29.520 --> 3:54:32.120]  The time to choose sides has come.
[3:54:32.120 --> 3:54:34.040]  We are the resistance.
[3:54:34.040 --> 3:54:36.280]  We are the info war.
[3:54:36.280 --> 3:54:40.040]  All right, final segment of Jam these calls in.
[3:54:40.040 --> 3:54:46.960]  Like I said, the guys compiled a breakdown of the Oregon shooting.
[3:54:46.960 --> 3:54:50.800]  They did find someone else with a gambit say it's unrelated, who knows what that means.
[3:54:50.800 --> 3:54:54.520]  The mayor lodged the drill that occurred a couple months ago there, but then there's
[3:54:54.520 --> 3:54:57.280]  been no confirmation that drill did happen.
[3:54:57.280 --> 3:55:01.600]  Probably just getting related to people, one bad guy, one other person shooting someone.
[3:55:01.600 --> 3:55:07.000]  But again, they just hype up this fetish when people, there's 317 million people.
[3:55:07.000 --> 3:55:10.120]  There's going to be stuff going on.
[3:55:10.120 --> 3:55:11.120]  People get struck by lightning.
[3:55:11.120 --> 3:55:12.120]  People drowned.
[3:55:12.120 --> 3:55:14.640]  I mean, it goes on.
[3:55:14.640 --> 3:55:16.320]  Let's go to phone calls here.
[3:55:16.320 --> 3:55:17.640]  Let's go to Jeff in Canada.
[3:55:17.640 --> 3:55:19.560]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[3:55:19.560 --> 3:55:26.120]  Alex, God bless info wars and the entire team were printed for you and all your families.
[3:55:26.120 --> 3:55:28.920]  I can imagine what they must be going through.
[3:55:28.920 --> 3:55:35.120]  But what I wanted to talk about was the Canadian government and how complicit they are and
[3:55:35.120 --> 3:55:38.960]  how in lockstep they are with this entire globalist agenda.
[3:55:38.960 --> 3:55:46.040]  All the way back going back to the 60s involved in the MK ultra program, doing including, you
[3:55:46.040 --> 3:55:51.800]  know, the Afghan war in Afghanistan and the opium war that they were operating there,
[3:55:51.800 --> 3:55:54.000]  the Anglo-American empire.
[3:55:54.000 --> 3:55:58.560]  But what I wanted to talk about was this, it runs a shooter.
[3:55:58.560 --> 3:56:04.440]  And how I believe that there's a good chance that this is completely staged within a few
[3:56:04.440 --> 3:56:06.600]  minutes of the shooting going on.
[3:56:06.600 --> 3:56:12.320]  They had somebody there taking photographs like photographs of the shooter, you know,
[3:56:12.320 --> 3:56:18.120]  that's always tell, tell that before connections were even found to me.
[3:56:18.120 --> 3:56:22.160]  All the usual White House controlled suspects were saying Alex Jones Tea Party and then
[3:56:22.160 --> 3:56:24.640]  walla it was all there.
[3:56:24.640 --> 3:56:32.320]  Well, this guy in New Brunswick is, you know, the Canadian Patriot guy and the guns of libertarian
[3:56:32.320 --> 3:56:33.320]  freedom.
[3:56:33.320 --> 3:56:38.320]  And it happened exactly at the same time as this was a shooter just reading lockstep
[3:56:38.320 --> 3:56:42.480]  shooting, a couple of cops, you know, and he's a freedom guy anarchist, blah, blah,
[3:56:42.480 --> 3:56:43.480]  blah, whatever.
[3:56:43.480 --> 3:56:48.920]  And I just think that the Canadian government is completely complicit in this and people
[3:56:48.920 --> 3:56:53.040]  in Canada think that we're going to escape this civil war.
[3:56:53.040 --> 3:56:56.560]  You know, your brothers to the north are pretty much involved.
[3:56:56.560 --> 3:57:01.000]  Oh, I know there are resting preachers that read anti homosexual stuff out of the Bible
[3:57:01.000 --> 3:57:02.000]  in Canada.
[3:57:02.000 --> 3:57:06.840]  And again, I don't go to churches where they're bashing a bunch of people or whatever, but
[3:57:06.840 --> 3:57:11.440]  at the same time, it's free speech and we're supposedly in the West here, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:57:11.440 --> 3:57:13.200]  and you got to support free speech.
[3:57:13.200 --> 3:57:15.000]  I appreciate your call.
[3:57:15.000 --> 3:57:16.480]  Let's go to Julian in Texas.
[3:57:16.480 --> 3:57:19.360]  Sorry, last caller I have time for to the others.
[3:57:19.360 --> 3:57:20.640]  I want to go to crazy horse too.
[3:57:20.640 --> 3:57:21.640]  We'll see Julian.
[3:57:21.640 --> 3:57:24.640]  Go ahead.
[3:57:24.640 --> 3:57:25.640]  Very interesting.
[3:57:25.640 --> 3:57:26.640]  Go ahead, Julian.
[3:57:26.640 --> 3:57:27.640]  Okay.
[3:57:27.640 --> 3:57:28.640]  I guess we will go to crazy horse.
[3:57:28.640 --> 3:57:30.320]  It was meant to be crazy horse in California.
[3:57:30.320 --> 3:57:31.320]  Go ahead.
[3:57:31.320 --> 3:57:32.320]  Alex.
[3:57:32.320 --> 3:57:40.000]  I don't want to go into details or specifics of names and anything, so I want to protect
[3:57:40.000 --> 3:57:43.000]  officers and their families as well as myself.
[3:57:43.000 --> 3:57:48.360]  I haven't really spoken my lawyer for calling you, but you're telling me what happened.
[3:57:48.360 --> 3:57:49.560]  You're anonymous and nobody knows it.
[3:57:49.560 --> 3:57:50.560]  It doesn't matter.
[3:57:50.560 --> 3:57:51.560]  Go ahead.
[3:57:51.560 --> 3:57:52.560]  Tell me.
[3:57:52.560 --> 3:57:58.360]  I just want to tell you and your listeners that the sheriff's are being told, you know,
[3:57:58.360 --> 3:58:07.760]  all this propaganda, so excuse me, they're going out and taking Patriots guns at a soft
[3:58:07.760 --> 3:58:08.760]  gun confiscation.
[3:58:08.760 --> 3:58:10.880]  And so they brought up, well, Patriots are killing people.
[3:58:10.880 --> 3:58:12.880]  We got to take your guns.
[3:58:12.880 --> 3:58:15.440]  Well, there was an issue that came up.
[3:58:15.440 --> 3:58:22.680]  We had a string of burglaries around my area and a car showed up on my neighbor's property.
[3:58:22.680 --> 3:58:24.160]  It looked like they were running from somebody.
[3:58:24.160 --> 3:58:25.160]  I know.
[3:58:25.160 --> 3:58:26.160]  Finish real quick because you stay on the board.
[3:58:26.160 --> 3:58:27.160]  They took your gun.
[3:58:27.160 --> 3:58:33.600]  Yeah, basically, the sheriff came, they took my gun, they never charged me, and I know
[3:58:33.600 --> 3:58:35.360]  that's because you're in California.
[3:58:35.360 --> 3:58:39.560]  Even Bloomberg reports the headline that gun confiscation has a gun outside of law just
[3:58:39.560 --> 3:58:41.040]  like Obama's open the borders.
[3:58:41.040 --> 3:58:42.040]  Great job of the crew.
[3:58:42.040 --> 3:58:43.040]  That's four hours.
[3:58:43.040 --> 3:58:45.040]  Nightly News tonight, seven.
[3:58:45.040 --> 3:58:46.040]  We'll all be boiled down.
[3:58:46.040 --> 3:58:49.000]  Prisonplanet.tv to become a member today.
[3:58:49.000 --> 3:59:00.320]  Some weather's against us evil.
