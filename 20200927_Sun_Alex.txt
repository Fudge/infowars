[00:00.000 --> 00:21.840]  We're only 36 days out from the election, but the deep state run Democrats have openly
[00:21.840 --> 00:26.680]  said they're going to contest the election, and not just for a day, not for a week, not
[00:26.680 --> 00:31.360]  for two weeks, but right through to the inauguration, causing a break up of the country.
[00:31.360 --> 00:37.000]  That's their criminal gold, and they're back in the news admitting it today.
[00:37.000 --> 00:38.360]  So this is a big, big deal.
[00:38.360 --> 00:40.880]  We're going to be laying all of this out tonight.
[00:40.880 --> 00:44.240]  We're going to be looking at the new Supreme Court nominee and how that adds gasoline to
[00:44.240 --> 00:47.920]  already explosive situation and so much more.
[00:47.920 --> 00:48.920]  Look at this headline.
[00:48.920 --> 00:51.320]  Military will not have role in transition.
[00:51.320 --> 00:58.120]  Ex-Trump National Security Advisor rejects left's coup fantasy, and then the left online
[00:58.120 --> 01:01.560]  criticizes McMaster, who's a total globalist.
[01:01.560 --> 01:03.560]  It's a big deal.
[01:03.560 --> 01:06.920]  But I thought I'd start with something that's really at the heart of it.
[01:06.920 --> 01:10.840]  Member four years ago, how the Info Warriors took over all the live events, instead Bill
[01:10.840 --> 01:14.840]  Clinton's a rapist and pointed out that Bill Clinton and Hillary were globalists and tied
[01:14.840 --> 01:17.640]  to Jeffrey Epstein's pedophile island.
[01:17.640 --> 01:21.560]  We would talk about Jeffrey Epstein on national TV and take over live events, so much so they
[01:21.560 --> 01:25.160]  canceled most of their live events the last few weeks.
[01:25.160 --> 01:29.520]  Well they were out front just yesterday at CNN, the full videos on InfoWars.com.
[01:29.520 --> 01:33.360]  CNN was outside the Supreme Court building and thought they'd be able to go live out
[01:33.360 --> 01:39.720]  there, and turns out everywhere CNN goes, this now happens.
[01:39.720 --> 01:42.920]  Justice on the Supreme Court, over the next 30 or 40 years.
[01:42.920 --> 01:43.920]  Right?
[01:43.920 --> 01:44.920]  Well, absolutely.
[01:44.920 --> 01:51.920]  I just wanted to say that why we were here on the crowd behind us, some supporters started
[01:51.920 --> 01:52.920]  standing through.
[01:52.920 --> 02:00.920]  We can hear you getting a little bit of time here, it's a crowd of some supporters.
[02:00.920 --> 02:02.120]  Arianna, I want you to stand by.
[02:02.120 --> 02:05.960]  We can barely hear what you're saying, because of the crowd behind you, if you have a handheld
[02:05.960 --> 02:09.280]  bike, maybe we'll be able to appreciate what you're saying.
[02:09.280 --> 02:10.280]  Stand by for a moment.
[02:10.280 --> 02:11.280]  Jump to scoop it.
[02:11.280 --> 02:12.960]  Our Supreme Court analyst is standing by.
[02:12.960 --> 02:19.880]  So explain the legal consequences of what we heard from the president.
[02:19.880 --> 02:26.840]  And then we've got this, it'll also not make you smile, but make you laugh at Biden.
[02:26.840 --> 02:30.880]  They're the ones that had the fake Atlantic Monthly, Jeffrey Goldberg, same guy that put
[02:30.880 --> 02:33.680]  the fake news on WMDs, he's the main culprit.
[02:33.680 --> 02:41.840]  Jeffrey Goldberg come out and say that Trump, and from all these witnesses that I hate the
[02:41.840 --> 02:47.800]  military, they're dumb, they're idiots, they're stupid, and then we learn the exact quotes
[02:47.800 --> 02:48.800]  are out of Biden's mouth.
[02:48.800 --> 02:54.600]  They'll play it in a moment, but he grew up next door to their bar and to their restaurant.
[02:54.600 --> 02:59.400]  They even, I think, sold them some property, he was saying, and that's Tyler Nixon up in
[02:59.400 --> 03:04.960]  Delaware, they're on record being family friends because they live next door to each other.
[03:04.960 --> 03:07.880]  And there's a lot of correspondence, photos, all that on record.
[03:07.880 --> 03:12.760]  He said, the Bidens hate everyone and think they're elitist and just have this, this,
[03:12.760 --> 03:18.000]  this, this air, this, this imperious nature.
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.960]  So of course, what they said word for word about Trump is in word for word, we have on
[03:21.960 --> 03:24.400]  video of Biden just five years ago.
[03:24.400 --> 03:54.320]  There it is.
[03:54.320 --> 03:59.600]  So, man, you're slow, clapper that you stupid bastards.
[03:59.600 --> 04:03.600]  And with some people, that's their style and it's a joke, like a Rodney Danger filled,
[04:03.600 --> 04:05.400]  I don't get no respect.
[04:05.400 --> 04:06.400]  Not with him.
[04:06.400 --> 04:07.640]  This is how he is.
[04:07.640 --> 04:10.760]  He walks around talking about how smart he is.
[04:10.760 --> 04:14.960]  And he's so smart, he sounds like he has a mouthful of marbles.
[04:14.960 --> 04:17.760]  He's clearly had another major stroke.
[04:17.760 --> 04:18.760]  His face is drooping.
[04:18.760 --> 04:23.640]  You know, Ron Paul had a stroke, he's in the hospital, he'll probably retire, 85.
[04:23.640 --> 04:29.920]  This guy has basically small seizures all the time on TV and it's no big deal.
[04:29.920 --> 04:34.400]  Like when Hillary's having a seizure, falls down, media says, Oh, she didn't fall down
[04:34.400 --> 04:35.400]  fake news.
[04:35.400 --> 04:36.400]  It's on video.
[04:36.400 --> 04:37.400]  She fell down.
[04:37.400 --> 04:38.400]  All that in a convulsion.
[04:38.400 --> 04:44.160]  I mean, you know what a convulsion looks like, but Oh, no, CNN said that's fake news.
[04:44.160 --> 04:48.480]  These people are jokes, but they're propped up by billions and billions of dollars.
[04:48.480 --> 04:49.880]  So they just hang on.
[04:49.880 --> 04:51.120]  They're the undead media.
[04:51.120 --> 04:54.840]  It's a big broadcast tonight, this is not a spectator sport.
[04:54.840 --> 04:59.480]  Tell folks how to tune in now.
[04:59.480 --> 05:04.840]  This is your last chance to get a pack power stack and I'm really bummed out about that.
[05:04.840 --> 05:09.000]  It started out as a sleeper product, but the people that did order it loved it and sort
[05:09.000 --> 05:10.000]  of reordering it.
[05:10.000 --> 05:14.080]  They spread the word and became one of our best sellers, but because of the COVID supply
[05:14.080 --> 05:19.640]  chain breakdown, because there's 13 different formulas in a pack power stack, we are unable
[05:19.640 --> 05:21.600]  to secure it anymore.
[05:21.600 --> 05:27.080]  This is the highest in a MPM pack system you're going to find where you take half the pills
[05:27.080 --> 05:30.160]  in the morning, half the capitals and pills and shell caps at night.
[05:30.160 --> 05:31.160]  It's amazing.
[05:31.160 --> 05:34.320]  I don't have time to go into everything that's in it, but this gets people to remember to
[05:34.320 --> 05:35.320]  take it.
[05:35.320 --> 05:38.640]  And that's why it's having such a great effect because the stuff in here is absolutely amazing.
[05:38.640 --> 05:44.160]  So it's your last chance to get a power stack info or store.com it's 60% off and free shipping
[05:44.160 --> 05:48.000]  that is at cost for all of you that already support info wars, we're passing these savings
[05:48.000 --> 05:52.760]  onto you to your eight pack power stack now or you still can last chance to get it info
[05:52.760 --> 06:07.480]  wars store.com eight pack power stacks, 6% off and free shipping.
[06:07.480 --> 06:13.840]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center in the heart and the heart
[06:13.840 --> 06:22.680]  of the resistance fatally rallying patriots worldwide.
[06:22.680 --> 06:31.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show and we are go we are launch ignition lift off
[06:31.840 --> 06:40.560]  on this live Sunday September 27th 2020 transmission 114 days out of the inauguration 36 days for
[06:40.560 --> 06:42.560]  the election.
[06:42.560 --> 06:47.480]  Now as everyone knows info wars business is telling the truth info wars business is promoting
[06:47.480 --> 06:53.000]  human freedom and liberty info wars business is being tomorrow's news or next week's news
[06:53.000 --> 06:56.480]  next year's news today and I don't need to go over your regular listener all the things
[06:56.480 --> 07:03.520]  that we've accurately chronicled over the horizon that has now manifested itself.
[07:03.520 --> 07:06.400]  And not because it's materialized because I said it was happening.
[07:06.400 --> 07:10.920]  It's because we're aware of what the globalist actually are up to not what they put out for
[07:10.920 --> 07:12.760]  general public consumption.
[07:12.760 --> 07:17.760]  Their arrogance is they don't even hide what they do in their high level agreements.
[07:17.760 --> 07:24.160]  I mean at the Davos group they put out a report in February saying we're going to use COVID-19
[07:24.160 --> 07:28.120]  to lock down the economy bringing global digital tracking apps on everybody's phones shut down
[07:28.120 --> 07:33.040]  all small businesses and start the third world to death lower carbon emissions.
[07:33.040 --> 07:34.520]  They call it the great reset.
[07:34.520 --> 07:39.840]  We were saying in February this looks like the big reset that Davos has been calling
[07:39.840 --> 07:44.640]  for to shut down the world economy and consolidate power for them.
[07:44.640 --> 07:50.080]  And as we were reporting that like days later they come out with a huge report admitting
[07:50.080 --> 07:56.600]  it all and that's what is so frustrating about this broadcast is criminals love to brag
[07:56.600 --> 08:06.800]  and they love to lay out their battle plans and why would we sit here and not take them
[08:06.800 --> 08:11.440]  for their word for it when they've carried out every damn thing they've set out to carry
[08:11.440 --> 08:12.440]  out.
[08:12.440 --> 08:16.160]  Now a lot of times they're behind schedule a lot of times what they do falls apart but
[08:16.160 --> 08:22.200]  you know what they are trying to execute their plan as you can see and they are doing a lot
[08:22.200 --> 08:24.520]  of acceleration of it right now because they're behind.
[08:24.520 --> 08:29.120]  So let me tell you what's coming up today.
[08:29.120 --> 08:36.240]  Friday I got so over driven and so emotional that I covered it all but not in concise little
[08:36.240 --> 08:42.800]  giblets and when we come back in the next segment I'm going to give my emergency message
[08:42.800 --> 08:47.000]  to the president, my emergency message to the American people on what I think needs to be
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.200]  done specifically and decisively in what we're facing.
[08:52.200 --> 08:57.320]  Not from predictive powers but from studying the globalist operations and knowing exactly
[08:57.320 --> 08:59.720]  what it is they're planning to execute.
[08:59.720 --> 09:05.280]  Now does that mean they'll execute every exact way at the exact time I say no they don't
[09:05.280 --> 09:08.960]  know how they're going to execute but they've got a battle plan and they've got rules of
[09:08.960 --> 09:13.480]  engagement and they've got a program and we know how to stop them.
[09:13.480 --> 09:17.080]  They just hope that the public doesn't catch on to this and they can continue to move forward
[09:17.080 --> 09:20.960]  but they know the public is catching on to them and so is Congress and so are different
[09:20.960 --> 09:24.760]  sections of different corporate areas around the world.
[09:24.760 --> 09:25.760]  So there's major pushback.
[09:25.760 --> 09:29.360]  So let me tell you what's coming up.
[09:29.360 --> 09:34.520]  We have incredible mass rally part two in Trafalgar Square yesterday in London and we
[09:34.520 --> 09:39.480]  had medical doctors and others being arrested by riot police who were beating people over
[09:39.480 --> 09:46.680]  the heads with billy clubs, the same groups literally lead Muslims on giant parades burning
[09:46.680 --> 09:52.120]  things down and the same police literally lead black lives matter on their events burning
[09:52.120 --> 09:54.200]  things down and stabbing people.
[09:54.200 --> 09:56.920]  So the police in the UK are globalist operatives.
[09:56.920 --> 09:59.560]  You won't talk about bad police like the Nazis.
[09:59.560 --> 10:00.560]  This is it.
[10:00.560 --> 10:03.680]  And you can say well some Nazis weren't bad people that are following orders.
[10:03.680 --> 10:04.680]  It doesn't matter.
[10:04.680 --> 10:05.680]  They're robots.
[10:05.680 --> 10:09.920]  They're meat puppets and they're very, very bad people.
[10:09.920 --> 10:13.080]  David Ike will be joining us tomorrow.
[10:13.080 --> 10:14.080]  He was there.
[10:14.080 --> 10:18.920]  They were already attacking people as he was speaking and this is just incredible footage
[10:18.920 --> 10:23.600]  that we'll be getting to coming up later in the hour and part of David Ike's over the
[10:23.600 --> 10:24.600]  top speech.
[10:24.600 --> 10:26.680]  The full speech is at band.video.
[10:26.680 --> 10:29.040]  YouTube is pulling down his speech.
[10:29.040 --> 10:30.960]  Medical doctors were the main target that spoke.
[10:30.960 --> 10:35.640]  They were arrested, professors, scientists because specifically the police said you are
[10:35.640 --> 10:38.320]  not allowed to question the United Nations.
[10:38.320 --> 10:39.320]  Boom.
[10:39.320 --> 10:45.840]  Just like that, riot police attack you if you criticize what the UN has officially said
[10:45.840 --> 10:48.520]  even though it's all alive.
[10:48.520 --> 10:49.520]  Remember that.
[10:49.520 --> 10:54.800]  It's already got 134,000 views on band.video but again most versions of it have been taken
[10:54.800 --> 10:55.800]  down off YouTube.
[10:55.800 --> 10:56.800]  I knew instantly they'd be pulling it.
[10:56.800 --> 11:01.440]  I was sent a link to it, had like 1,000 viewers right after it was uploaded.
[11:01.440 --> 11:04.920]  The police had stormed the stage, grabbed all the equipment and started beating everyone
[11:04.920 --> 11:06.480]  over the head with billy clubs.
[11:06.480 --> 11:08.720]  There's just an hours of this footage.
[11:08.720 --> 11:13.480]  My wife got so upset last night, she was crying, she ended up watching over two hours
[11:13.480 --> 11:14.480]  of it.
[11:14.480 --> 11:19.880]  I told her to stop watching because I mean this is it, this is the tyranny and that's
[11:19.880 --> 11:27.640]  what's also happening from Australia to the U.K. to the U.S. Bars, restaurants, colleges,
[11:27.640 --> 11:31.480]  people's apartment buildings saying oh sorry now to be here you've got to have a contact
[11:31.480 --> 11:35.000]  tracing app on your phone and we've got to check it, you've got to keep your location
[11:35.000 --> 11:36.520]  services on at all time.
[11:36.520 --> 11:40.680]  We're tracking you and people are being thrown out of their apartments, thrown out of restaurants
[11:40.680 --> 11:41.680]  that don't have it.
[11:41.680 --> 11:46.080]  Imagine the control this brings in the global Chinese social credit score and we told her
[11:46.080 --> 11:53.800]  by this was coming back in, you know, March because that was the plan but now it's here.
[11:53.800 --> 11:54.800]  You don't have to wait anymore.
[11:54.800 --> 11:58.320]  Oh you're coming to the college here in Michigan or the college here in Texas or the college
[11:58.320 --> 12:02.760]  here in Connecticut or the college here in New Jersey or wherever, I've got the articles
[12:02.760 --> 12:03.760]  right here.
[12:03.760 --> 12:05.560]  I'm going to show them to you.
[12:05.560 --> 12:10.720]  You're not allowed to leave the campus for the entire semester and you can only go to
[12:10.720 --> 12:15.280]  stores we say you can and there's a curfew and we're tracking your distance from everyone
[12:15.280 --> 12:22.920]  at all times and we have citizen spies and cameras watching you.
[12:22.920 --> 12:28.320]  So that's all this is and we know what it is, hell they tell us that's what it is.
[12:28.320 --> 12:33.000]  But still a good part of the public signs on to it and goes along with it because oh
[12:33.000 --> 12:40.640]  you're heroes, no you're not heroes, you're being put into a giant prison grid, you're
[12:40.640 --> 12:42.640]  being turned into a robot.
[12:42.640 --> 12:48.360]  Okay, let's lay out more of what's coming up.
[12:48.360 --> 12:53.480]  The Democrats know they're losing the election by landslides so they're planning civil war
[12:53.480 --> 12:54.480]  as their response.
[12:54.480 --> 12:58.160]  Now I've been saying that for several years because I was reading what their leadership
[12:58.160 --> 13:04.240]  was saying in the, again, communication, their higher up anti-fund BLM operatives.
[13:04.240 --> 13:09.520]  Now they are externalizing those operations to operational on the ground and we've got
[13:09.520 --> 13:14.560]  big stacks of fire bombings, mall off cocktails, leftist running down people, putting them
[13:14.560 --> 13:20.760]  in critical condition, shooting more police officers and district attorneys in the areas
[13:20.760 --> 13:25.680]  being shot are not even charging the people that are shooting police.
[13:25.680 --> 13:30.120]  You heard that right, in Louisville, they arrested the man who in front of everyone
[13:30.120 --> 13:35.160]  fired premeditatedly with a handgun, shot a cop in the leg and the gut to police, he's
[13:35.160 --> 13:39.080]  not being charged with attempted murder.
[13:39.080 --> 13:41.360]  The national police unions are freaking out about it.
[13:41.360 --> 13:42.840]  This is a license to kill.
[13:42.840 --> 13:47.080]  You've heard of 007, right?
[13:47.080 --> 13:52.920]  Well, now here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:52.920 --> 13:54.240]  We'll be covering all that for you.
[13:54.240 --> 13:58.320]  I remember General Benton K. Parton, former head of Air Force weapons development, would
[13:58.320 --> 14:04.120]  come on the broadcast and he'd say, and he ran harp, he ran neutron bomb programs.
[14:04.120 --> 14:08.120]  I mean, he was in the highest levels of secret government, the good side.
[14:08.120 --> 14:12.280]  And he was like, Jones, you keep talking about Bilderberg and New World Order, and that's
[14:12.280 --> 14:13.280]  all part of it.
[14:13.280 --> 14:17.200]  There's big trillionaire groups running it, but they're using a communist playbook and
[14:17.200 --> 14:18.200]  it's a program.
[14:18.200 --> 14:21.800]  And once they get their numbers out, they're training at the universities and the prisons,
[14:21.800 --> 14:25.480]  they're going to start killing local police to take control of them and they'll have the
[14:25.480 --> 14:29.160]  Supreme Court get rid of the death penalty because they'll know they'll soon be released
[14:29.160 --> 14:33.040]  from prison so they can go out and commit murders building up to the revolution and
[14:33.040 --> 14:34.800]  then they'll be released.
[14:34.800 --> 14:38.960]  Or they'll get DA's in as part of their program so they could commit murders and get away
[14:38.960 --> 14:39.960]  with it.
[14:39.960 --> 14:42.400]  And that's when you know they're about to have the uprising.
[14:42.400 --> 14:43.800]  Listen to me, Jones.
[14:43.800 --> 14:44.800]  It's a program.
[14:44.800 --> 14:45.800]  I've seen it.
[14:45.800 --> 14:46.800]  That's what runs it.
[14:46.800 --> 14:52.240]  And I was like, okay, this is like in the late nineties and stuff.
[14:52.240 --> 14:54.520]  Everything he said was true.
[14:54.520 --> 14:55.680]  And it's a communist program.
[14:55.680 --> 14:56.680]  They're running against us.
[14:56.680 --> 15:01.600]  Just like the attorney general came out and said, anti-fun BLM are Bolsheviks with a fascist
[15:01.600 --> 15:03.040]  operating system.
[15:03.040 --> 15:04.400]  Word for word what I've said.
[15:04.400 --> 15:05.840]  It bargained for me?
[15:05.840 --> 15:06.840]  Probably not.
[15:06.840 --> 15:07.840]  I mean, it's like, what's that?
[15:07.840 --> 15:10.400]  Oh, that's an Abrams M1A1 tank.
[15:10.400 --> 15:11.400]  What's that?
[15:11.400 --> 15:12.400]  It's an Apache helicopter.
[15:12.400 --> 15:13.400]  What's that?
[15:13.400 --> 15:16.160]  You know, that's a blue check mark on Twitter.
[15:16.160 --> 15:17.720]  I mean, you know what a thing is.
[15:17.720 --> 15:23.560]  They're admitted Bolsheviks running a Bolshevik Revolution Part 2 with a fascist delivery
[15:23.560 --> 15:31.400]  system and the uniforms, the rules of engagement, the tactics, all of it.
[15:31.400 --> 15:33.000]  And what did I say in 2017?
[15:33.000 --> 15:36.960]  I said, they're planning Part 2 of the Bolshevik Revolution.
[15:36.960 --> 15:38.760]  And that's because that's what they said they're doing.
[15:38.760 --> 15:40.920]  I mean, it's like, how do you know that, Jones?
[15:40.920 --> 15:42.640]  How does it keep coming true?
[15:42.640 --> 15:44.280]  Because I'm watching the enemy.
[15:44.280 --> 15:46.400]  I mean, they tell us what they're going to do.
[15:46.400 --> 15:50.640]  It's like Hitler wrote it all in Mein Kampf and people were like struck that it actually
[15:50.640 --> 15:51.640]  did it.
[15:51.640 --> 15:54.640]  And when you, they write books telling you what they plan, well, they're right back
[15:54.640 --> 16:03.240]  there with us, the way the psychological warfare operation works is very, very simple.
[16:03.240 --> 16:06.880]  They give up freedoms by increments, always promising it's only going to be a short period
[16:06.880 --> 16:13.160]  of time and then the restrictions will be released, but they're not ever significant
[16:13.160 --> 16:16.720]  amount of time, always four or five times longer than what they said.
[16:16.720 --> 16:21.000]  They will then slightly release it a little bit, only tighten it down even more later.
[16:21.000 --> 16:27.640]  This is called successive approximation incrementalism or the inchworm effect.
[16:27.640 --> 16:32.120]  This is the most common way that the Salatarians take over, but there then becomes a point
[16:32.120 --> 16:36.920]  where the public wakes up under the incrementalism, he starts resisting and then there's usually
[16:36.920 --> 16:42.000]  a giant purge and a clamp down and you'll see more tyranny rolled out in just a few
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.920]  days, weeks or months that you saw in the previous 10 years.
[16:44.920 --> 16:48.320]  And that's the period we're in globally right now.
[16:48.320 --> 16:53.920]  A world government, chai combat, globalist corporate takeover of the planet that wants
[16:53.920 --> 16:58.120]  you poor and absolutely sick under their thumb forever.
[16:58.120 --> 17:07.440]  It's the evening of September 26th, 2020, and I just got done watching the horrible footage
[17:07.440 --> 17:14.240]  of thousands of riot police with trejans beating thousands of peaceful people in Trafalgar
[17:14.240 --> 17:20.040]  Square protesting the COVID martial law lockdown.
[17:20.040 --> 17:25.040]  An iron curtain is descending over the world from the United Nations, even more evil than
[17:25.040 --> 17:29.360]  the old Soviet Union and its model is communist China.
[17:29.360 --> 17:37.360]  We're not facing incremental tyranny, we're facing absolute 100% commitment to evil because
[17:37.360 --> 17:41.080]  the system thinks we're weak and thinks we're stupid and it's making this move.
[17:41.080 --> 17:44.640]  And whether it's Australia, the U.K. or the U.S., Black Lives Matter funded by Soros can
[17:44.640 --> 17:47.600]  run around and kill cops and burn things down in their heroes.
[17:47.600 --> 17:52.000]  And oh, nobody's worried about the COVID BS, but when it's patriots saying we have rights,
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.080]  we have dignity, they get viciously attacked.
[17:54.080 --> 17:57.680]  All the videos are at MFullWars.com of David Ike speaking and more.
[17:57.680 --> 18:05.200]  Hello, my name is Dr. Fauci, doesn't matter if I'm invested with Bill Gates, and many
[18:05.200 --> 18:09.680]  of the same vaccines I push on you, it's the same thing with the health ministers in the
[18:09.680 --> 18:15.200]  U.K. and Europe, they're all invested as well, but the government's decided it's not
[18:15.200 --> 18:17.200]  a conflict of interest.
[18:17.200 --> 18:23.680]  Also, the media is going to call me a genius when the second wave I've been warning of
[18:23.680 --> 18:29.480]  comes in the fall and winter, because we're done to count all the flu and all the pneumonia
[18:29.480 --> 18:36.160]  and cold death of old people again, and the lockdown will never end.
[18:36.160 --> 18:41.040]  That's why we're saying the vaccine will take several years, but don't worry, it'll
[18:41.040 --> 18:42.040]  come out.
[18:42.040 --> 18:48.360]  I'll make a bunch of money, you'll get sick, but that's okay, because I ran the Wuhan lab
[18:48.360 --> 18:51.840]  and it's all public, but I don't get in trouble.
[18:51.840 --> 18:59.680]  If you thought that about me, we use PITDAC to shut you up.
[18:59.680 --> 19:04.440]  The Renaissance, the great enlightenment, it's all being swept away and being replaced
[19:04.440 --> 19:05.440]  by...
[19:05.440 --> 19:14.880]  Scientific tyranny that's establishing a form of planetary digital law where the technocrats
[19:14.880 --> 19:20.960]  are above the law and the public isn't even considered to be as valuable as a cow.
[19:20.960 --> 19:26.360]  In fact, humans are seen as garbage that's going to be taken out and removed.
[19:26.360 --> 19:32.640]  That is the post-human extermination plan, that is the public ideology of the globalists,
[19:32.640 --> 19:38.000]  and everything they've built with this high-tech grid is to absorb us and anesthetize our
[19:38.000 --> 19:45.000]  minds as we're slowly killed, and any future generations that happen to straggle out of
[19:45.000 --> 19:49.440]  their mother's wounds will be a mere shadow of what humans once were.
[19:49.440 --> 19:57.200]  This is the satanic ruling elite engaged in mass vandalism against God's creation, humanity.
[19:57.200 --> 20:01.880]  This is the essence of evil.
[20:01.880 --> 20:08.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:08.880 --> 20:31.720]  Here we are, 36 days from the election, 114 days out from the inauguration.
[20:31.720 --> 20:33.560]  All right, let's lay it out.
[20:33.560 --> 20:36.120]  Here's my emergency message to President Trump.
[20:36.120 --> 20:37.880]  Here's my emergency message to the American people.
[20:37.880 --> 20:41.360]  Here's my emergency message to the people of the world.
[20:41.360 --> 20:45.640]  President Trump, I've seen you really come out and level the American people about how
[20:45.640 --> 20:48.760]  the Democrats work with Communist China, how they want to overthrow the nation, how they
[20:48.760 --> 20:52.480]  want to kill the dollar, how they want to kill prosperity and complete our journey into
[20:52.480 --> 20:53.480]  enslavement.
[20:53.480 --> 20:58.440]  And my advice has been, even though it's terrible to have to say those things, it's the truth,
[20:58.440 --> 21:03.320]  and that's the only way you can counter them and really how nasty they are is to just come
[21:03.320 --> 21:06.800]  right out with who they are to the American people, and you've done that.
[21:06.800 --> 21:10.440]  And you've told them the truth, and you've exposed the mainstream media as being enemies
[21:10.440 --> 21:12.680]  of the American people.
[21:12.680 --> 21:19.760]  But when it comes to exposing their plan to confuse and derail the election towards having
[21:19.760 --> 21:24.960]  you removed from office and frustrating the will of the American voters, a continuation
[21:24.960 --> 21:31.120]  of what they've already been doing for three-plus years, almost four years, you've got to come
[21:31.120 --> 21:35.520]  out and specifically not just make comments about the mail-in ballots, the 80 million
[21:35.520 --> 21:39.280]  of them getting sent to dead dogs and dead cats and dead people, and how they're finding
[21:39.280 --> 21:45.040]  them in ditches and finding them in waste paper baskets and finding them in dumpsters.
[21:45.040 --> 21:48.320]  And of course, they're all Trump votes.
[21:48.320 --> 21:49.520]  They're all military votes.
[21:49.520 --> 21:50.520]  They're all senior votes.
[21:50.520 --> 21:52.360]  They, in all the cases, they're Trump votes.
[21:52.360 --> 21:56.560]  We understand that's how the USPS Democrat operatives are going to act.
[21:56.560 --> 21:57.560]  They've already been arrested.
[21:57.560 --> 21:58.560]  They've already been caught.
[21:58.560 --> 22:02.520]  I've got dozens of articles today with Democrats caught in election fraud all over the country
[22:02.520 --> 22:03.520]  with mail-in ballots.
[22:03.520 --> 22:06.400]  So, absolutely, we know that's going on.
[22:06.400 --> 22:10.600]  But it's not even going to be the mail-in ballot itself that does that.
[22:10.600 --> 22:11.920]  That bullet's already been fired.
[22:11.920 --> 22:14.400]  That arrow's already been loosed.
[22:14.400 --> 22:20.480]  It's the Democrat judges in Michigan and other states like Pennsylvania saying they're going
[22:20.480 --> 22:28.200]  to keep the election going for months, if not longer, some say weeks, others say months,
[22:28.200 --> 22:35.800]  to quote, make sure all the ballots are counted to create a civil war crisis in America.
[22:35.800 --> 22:41.960]  And so President Trump has to level with the American people about the Democrat plan for
[22:41.960 --> 22:50.880]  what I call 79 days of hell, 79 days in another brazen attempt, just like the Russia hoax,
[22:50.880 --> 22:55.520]  to claim that the election of Donald John Trump, the 45th President of the United States,
[22:55.520 --> 22:57.840]  the first time and the second time is illegitimate.
[22:57.840 --> 22:59.360]  They know they're losing.
[22:59.360 --> 23:04.360]  Mr. President, you have the Podesta war game that even the New York Times reported on that
[23:04.360 --> 23:06.160]  they can't deny.
[23:06.160 --> 23:11.280]  Where they say, we're going to contest it because we know we're going to lose.
[23:11.280 --> 23:15.640]  And then we try to hold it up to inauguration day and hope the military takes out Trump.
[23:15.640 --> 23:24.520]  Those are quotes from two months ago, two plus months ago, nine weeks ago.
[23:24.520 --> 23:29.240]  I've been beating the drum before that because this is their play, then they have Congress
[23:29.240 --> 23:32.720]  in the letter to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Milley, and ask him, will
[23:32.720 --> 23:34.720]  they help remove you if you contest?
[23:34.720 --> 23:40.440]  So you have to walk through it in a long speech, not just an offhand comment here and offhand
[23:40.440 --> 23:41.440]  comment there.
[23:41.440 --> 23:45.680]  I know the media attacks you when you talk about it and act like it's outrageous because
[23:45.680 --> 23:47.320]  that's what will defeat them.
[23:47.320 --> 23:48.640]  That's what will expose them.
[23:48.640 --> 23:53.400]  So the fact that your advisors say, sir, shy away from this, oh, sir, the media is talking
[23:53.400 --> 23:56.800]  to Republican leaders and they're saying, if you try to contest the election, they won't
[23:56.800 --> 23:58.320]  back you.
[23:58.320 --> 24:01.200]  You've got to expose the whole fraud.
[24:01.200 --> 24:02.800]  They say they're going to lose.
[24:02.800 --> 24:08.240]  They say they're going to contest to hold up things, create civil unrest, hurt the dollar,
[24:08.240 --> 24:11.720]  try to get the military involved, have Western states secede.
[24:11.720 --> 24:16.560]  I forgot that part, starting with California and have a new government set up with Nancy
[24:16.560 --> 24:21.960]  Pelosi on national TV saying, we'll hold a separate inauguration even if you won't leave
[24:21.960 --> 24:22.960]  the White House.
[24:22.960 --> 24:25.320]  So that's their plan.
[24:25.320 --> 24:27.320]  They've stated it.
[24:27.320 --> 24:32.280]  And it's not enough to say they're going to run a scam with all these ballots.
[24:32.280 --> 24:37.520]  That's just the cover to launch the contesting.
[24:37.520 --> 24:43.560]  And then they say, if you can test that you're the one that's a dictator and the military
[24:43.560 --> 24:48.440]  needs to take you out and they're out there in every newspaper every day, they're on CNN,
[24:48.440 --> 24:56.640]  MSNBC, ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, even putting out this idea and then fake stories about, oh,
[24:56.640 --> 25:00.720]  we called all these Republican leaders and said, if Trump won't leave office, are you
[25:00.720 --> 25:02.720]  going to help him stay?
[25:02.720 --> 25:03.720]  That's a misrepresentation.
[25:03.720 --> 25:10.280]  If the Democrats can test or engage in fraud, you must obviously contest and challenge them.
[25:10.280 --> 25:15.440]  They're trying to set up the precedent that if you can test and if you challenge their
[25:15.440 --> 25:20.760]  contention that somehow you are refusing to accept the results.
[25:20.760 --> 25:25.320]  So they're changing definitions like they always do again.
[25:25.320 --> 25:30.360]  So you and your speech writers and you and the experts that are very smart in the White
[25:30.360 --> 25:35.480]  House and people like Tucker Carlson that gets this need to boil this down into very
[25:35.480 --> 25:42.760]  easy to understand talking points, run ads showing Democrats saying we're going to contest
[25:42.760 --> 25:43.760]  no matter what.
[25:43.760 --> 25:51.360]  You can run Hillary, you can run Biden, you can run Big Mike saying it, you can run dozens
[25:51.360 --> 25:58.400]  of top Democrats saying we're not going to take the results and that's how we're going
[25:58.400 --> 26:03.280]  to drive him from office and if we have to, we'll break the country up and that's outrageous
[26:03.280 --> 26:09.040]  and Americans will see that and know that and then we won't wait until they have it
[26:09.040 --> 26:13.600]  on their terms at the election in 36 days.
[26:13.600 --> 26:17.680]  They're laying the groundwork and setting the battle space and setting all the terms
[26:17.680 --> 26:23.880]  with the whole media, just like the COVID scam, just like the COVID power grab.
[26:23.880 --> 26:30.740]  So they can exacerbate the crisis and use that crisis to bring in a national breakdown
[26:30.740 --> 26:36.460]  and so I'll get in here next week with my crew, we'll put together the videos in Donald
[26:36.460 --> 26:40.520]  Trump style campaign ads, maybe as an example for what your guys need to get on and need
[26:40.520 --> 26:45.840]  to do and we'll continue to leave from the front here, it's just that I know the president
[26:45.840 --> 26:49.800]  has a lot of resources and the Republicans have a lot of resources and the Republicans
[26:49.800 --> 26:54.480]  really want to save the Republic, stop the fraud, they need to come out boldly and say
[26:54.480 --> 26:58.240]  the Democrats are Chinese agents, what you're doing, the Democrats want to destroy the very
[26:58.240 --> 27:02.000]  survival of the country, what you're doing, the Democrats want to end the nation and
[27:02.000 --> 27:03.760]  wreck it and consolidate power.
[27:03.760 --> 27:09.120]  All of that you're starting to do and America gets it, it's the truth, but you need to
[27:09.120 --> 27:18.160]  come out and come up with your own term, your own slogan, stop the 79 days of hell or the
[27:18.160 --> 27:25.080]  Democrats planning on the 79 days that destroy the Republic and just get right out front
[27:25.080 --> 27:32.640]  with ads and speeches and all your surrogates, laying it out, laying it out, laying it out.
[27:32.640 --> 27:36.440]  It's really good that Republicans are watching everywhere and the Democrats are being busted
[27:36.440 --> 27:43.400]  10, 20, 30 operations a day engaged in red-handed election fraud, in red-handed ballot harvesting,
[27:43.400 --> 27:49.840]  in red-handed voting in the name of dead people and other Democrats are being caught mailing
[27:49.840 --> 27:59.440]  out voter registration cards and postcards to illegal aliens and to people not registered
[27:59.440 --> 28:06.360]  to vote and to felons because that's their plan is to have them come in and swamp everything
[28:06.360 --> 28:12.280]  with so many bad ballots that it's such a snarl like when you cast with your line to
[28:12.280 --> 28:17.920]  fish and you get a backlash and it's all tied up in a bunch of wires, in a bunch of line
[28:17.920 --> 28:22.080]  and you can't fix it and that's what they're hoping to do.
[28:22.080 --> 28:24.920]  The Democrats are like a fish that's grabbed the lure and they're running away with the
[28:24.920 --> 28:29.920]  line and they hope that we wait to pull back on the line until election day and by then
[28:29.920 --> 28:34.040]  it's going to tie up the entire works of the rod and reel.
[28:34.040 --> 28:39.560]  You got to get in there and start reeling that fish in now before it runs off anymore.
[28:39.560 --> 28:43.600]  You got to get ahead of the narrative, you got to expose how they did it.
[28:43.600 --> 28:47.120]  I'll give you some examples when we come back but the ad comes in like, first the Democrats
[28:47.120 --> 28:51.000]  secretly approached the Pentagon overthrow Trump, they said no, then they publicly did
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.840]  it, writing letters from the Armed Services Committee asking him to overthrow Trump.
[28:54.840 --> 28:59.440]  The Pentagon said no, now they're trying to.
[28:59.440 --> 29:04.480]  Over the global lock-downs, you're witnessing the Black Lives Matter, Antifa riots and
[29:04.480 --> 29:11.600]  racial attacks we're all seeing are publicly directed by a handful of top billionaires
[29:11.600 --> 29:17.360]  led by people like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, of course, Tim Cook and others.
[29:17.360 --> 29:22.520]  They set up there with their trillions of dollars they control in their companies and
[29:22.520 --> 29:28.280]  they're hundreds of billions of dollars individually leveraging that against us and trying to create
[29:28.280 --> 29:33.960]  an artificial revolution against local government and police and the mayors are again there
[29:33.960 --> 29:38.320]  playing their political game to try to trigger the complete breakdown of the United States
[29:38.320 --> 29:42.640]  and Western Europe to show these billionaires can come in and buy it all up for billions
[29:42.640 --> 29:43.640]  on the dollar.
[29:43.640 --> 29:47.280]  That's why I'm so angry that these globalists, because when you're looking at them, they're
[29:47.280 --> 29:52.040]  the ones that sit in their councils and have decided to run these plans against us.
[29:52.040 --> 29:59.760]  They are enemies of humanity and must be dealt with, it's us or them, period.
[29:59.760 --> 30:04.600]  You notice that over and over again the United Nations, our supposed controllers and bosses,
[30:04.600 --> 30:09.280]  the great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed to disagree with, has come out and said nothing
[30:09.280 --> 30:11.760]  can treat or prevent COVID-19.
[30:11.760 --> 30:14.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's a total lie.
[30:14.400 --> 30:19.240]  You get a lot of sunlight, it's on record, to produce a ton of vitamin D3 and it's almost
[30:19.240 --> 30:23.960]  impossible to get viral infections when you're getting plenty of vitamin D3 if you have zinc
[30:23.960 --> 30:25.400]  and vitamin C as well.
[30:25.400 --> 30:29.320]  That's why people get the flus and these colds in the winter, because that's a vitamin D
[30:29.320 --> 30:30.320]  levels plunge.
[30:30.320 --> 30:35.800]  Now I've pointed this out and the media has called me a scammer for saying that there's
[30:35.800 --> 30:38.440]  hope that people should have their vitamins and their minerals.
[30:38.440 --> 30:43.520]  Well now Fauci's been forced to come out and admit that you need vitamin D3 and C, he should
[30:43.520 --> 30:48.720]  have also added zinc, because the NIH website says you die without zinc, but it's good news
[30:48.720 --> 30:53.040]  that he's being pressured now to admit the reality because so many doctors and nurses
[30:53.040 --> 30:56.760]  and experts in nutrition have been exposing the fact that he's not been warning the public
[30:56.760 --> 30:58.680]  to get their vitamins.
[30:58.680 --> 31:04.200]  The planets have aligned globally, they've aligned nationally, they've aligned financially,
[31:04.200 --> 31:07.800]  culturally, but most importantly, spiritually.
[31:07.800 --> 31:13.920]  We are living at a point in human development that's beside the entire future destiny of
[31:13.920 --> 31:14.920]  our species.
[31:14.920 --> 31:19.720]  And that's why big tech control with the very dark forces of the globalist is trying to
[31:19.720 --> 31:25.880]  dumb us down, isolate us, make us depressed, make us alone, and try to control every aspect
[31:25.880 --> 31:30.480]  of our lives, literally brainwashing us with the stimuli that they look forward, because
[31:30.480 --> 31:36.400]  they do not want us to take our birthright, not just of Americana, but of true Christendom
[31:36.400 --> 31:39.080]  and the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.
[31:39.080 --> 31:43.200]  They are trying to create the new dark age where they have all the high technology and
[31:43.200 --> 31:48.520]  life extension, and we are walled off in a technocracy that controls us through carbon
[31:48.520 --> 31:51.520]  credits and through a social credit score.
[31:51.520 --> 31:53.400]  This is their plan.
[31:53.400 --> 31:58.160]  We must come together and awaken out of our trance and say no, we must embrace God.
[31:58.160 --> 32:06.880]  And perhaps, most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way to complications from COVID-19,
[32:06.880 --> 32:14.160]  which are well beyond what they should be, it's estimated that 200 million people have
[32:14.160 --> 32:15.560]  died.
[32:15.560 --> 32:18.320]  Probably by the time I finish this talk.
[32:18.320 --> 32:23.560]  Joe Biden has always been a congenital liar, part of the establishment for close to 50
[32:23.560 --> 32:24.560]  years.
[32:24.560 --> 32:31.120]  But now, boy, as his brain degenerates, we are seeing walking public dementia on the
[32:31.120 --> 32:34.640]  biggest stage of the world, the 2020 election.
[32:34.640 --> 32:37.640]  There are 370 million people in the United States.
[32:37.640 --> 32:42.520]  If 200 million died from COVID, that'd be more than half of the population, when not
[32:42.520 --> 32:45.160]  even one tenth of 1% have actually died.
[32:45.160 --> 32:50.200]  But him putting these giant lies and these incredibly brain damage statements out is
[32:50.200 --> 32:53.600]  emblematic of the general public being in a trance.
[32:53.600 --> 32:55.760]  How is anyone even putting up with this?
[32:55.760 --> 33:01.800]  It is beyond bizarre.
[33:01.800 --> 33:08.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[16:44.740 --> 33:51.640]  ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us, I'm just here, a
[33:51.640 --> 33:58.600]  modern ball of irons like you are, drowning as many people as I can to wake up and realize.
[33:58.600 --> 33:59.600]  This is the biggest fault.
[33:59.600 --> 34:04.080]  This is what the globalist technocrats and world domination and their whole plan has
[34:04.080 --> 34:06.160]  been building towards.
[34:06.160 --> 34:09.360]  And now people know it in the joke and they're going and researching what we've talked about
[34:09.360 --> 34:13.360]  for years when others have talked about, they're finding out, now this is worse than you're
[34:13.360 --> 34:14.360]  saying.
[34:14.360 --> 34:15.360]  Exactly.
[34:15.360 --> 34:16.360]  It's crazy.
[34:16.360 --> 34:17.880]  You're not going to even explain.
[34:17.880 --> 34:21.280]  I mean, some of the stuff they do is so crazy, I wouldn't even talk about it on air because
[34:21.280 --> 34:24.680]  people just can't believe it.
[34:24.680 --> 34:27.520]  Absolutely insane.
[34:27.520 --> 34:30.120]  That's a whole other subject.
[34:30.120 --> 34:34.320]  But let me try to quantify this and I'm going to get to the rest of the news that ties into
[34:34.320 --> 34:35.320]  this.
[34:35.320 --> 34:39.600]  Again, Alex Jones here, we just tuned in.
[34:39.600 --> 34:44.640]  We've already seen the deep state backed by foreign powers like China.
[34:44.640 --> 34:51.040]  It's an alliance, an axis of a true evil.
[34:51.040 --> 34:55.760]  Communist China, the global international corporate system, the EU, the Hollywood, America
[34:55.760 --> 35:01.360]  hating trash, all their leftist followers, allied with Orthodox radical Islam.
[35:01.360 --> 35:02.960]  They all work in tandem.
[35:02.960 --> 35:03.960]  They're all above the law.
[35:03.960 --> 35:07.280]  They all do whatever they want.
[35:07.280 --> 35:12.200]  The final straw is letting Islamists and communists kill and firebomb and rape people and not
[35:12.200 --> 35:13.200]  charge them.
[35:13.200 --> 35:17.360]  And that's now happening across the United States.
[35:17.360 --> 35:18.360]  It's unbelievable.
[35:18.360 --> 35:19.880]  I got a stack of news on that coming up.
[35:19.880 --> 35:22.160]  Did you hear what I said?
[35:22.160 --> 35:29.080]  You walk up to a police line, pull a gun and shoot two cops in the stomach and the leg,
[35:29.080 --> 35:33.240]  confess to it and they don't charge you with attempted murder.
[35:33.240 --> 35:34.480]  That's Louisville, Kentucky.
[35:34.480 --> 35:36.080]  That's in the stack.
[35:36.080 --> 35:38.080]  That's coming up.
[35:38.080 --> 35:43.720]  When they start getting district attorneys whose parents were in the weathermen, the
[35:43.720 --> 35:49.160]  new DA they just elected in Austin is an admitted communist that George Soros gave 700,000 to
[35:49.160 --> 35:50.160]  get elected.
[35:50.160 --> 35:57.360]  To sit in the game, folks, when they start giving their killers, get out of jail free
[35:57.360 --> 36:05.040]  cards, that's meant to embolden them to go start murdering people in mass and then after
[36:05.040 --> 36:08.520]  the overthrow happens, they get let out of jail and now they're going to be police officers.
[36:08.520 --> 36:12.920]  But not the kind that America has, the kind that come to your house with George Soros and
[36:12.920 --> 36:13.920]  take your house.
[36:13.920 --> 36:18.800]  That's what George Soros would do when he worked for the Nazis.
[36:18.800 --> 36:22.520]  There's a special kind of police officer like to have in Venezuela, like to have in Cuba.
[36:22.520 --> 36:24.520]  Want to live under those?
[36:24.520 --> 36:26.800]  Oh, then we will be the enemy of the police.
[36:26.800 --> 36:28.200]  The police will be our enemy.
[36:28.200 --> 36:29.200]  They're not now.
[36:29.200 --> 36:33.040]  They got their problems, but they're a lot better than other police.
[36:33.040 --> 36:34.440]  You think you got a bad government now?
[36:34.440 --> 36:35.440]  Just wait.
[36:35.440 --> 36:39.280]  You're going to be wishing for the old government praying for it and it's going to be real hard
[36:39.280 --> 36:40.280]  to get back.
[36:40.280 --> 36:41.640]  A lot of civil war.
[36:41.640 --> 36:47.920]  You know, they're paralleling the Spanish Civil War to what's about to happen here.
[36:47.920 --> 36:51.920]  The Spanish Civil War was the dress rehearsal for World War II and the parallels are eerily
[36:51.920 --> 36:52.920]  accurate.
[36:52.920 --> 36:54.840]  Zero hedge article out on a day.
[36:54.840 --> 36:56.560]  I suggest you go read it.
[36:56.560 --> 37:00.440]  Okay, let's get back to what's really happening.
[37:00.440 --> 37:05.120]  I just spent a 10 minute segment earlier trying to quantify this and Trump accidentally watched
[37:05.120 --> 37:06.120]  like two minute videos.
[37:06.120 --> 37:08.040]  The point is this gets out to his advisors.
[37:08.040 --> 37:09.040]  They can boil it down.
[37:09.040 --> 37:10.040]  They can get to the president.
[37:10.040 --> 37:13.800]  And now the president clicks with what I say and so does advisors because we're always
[37:13.800 --> 37:17.880]  ahead of the game and they fight around the clock to keep our info from getting the president
[37:17.880 --> 37:24.040]  but you can get it to him as well.
[37:24.040 --> 37:26.560]  Tucker Carlson can get information to the president.
[37:26.560 --> 37:29.080]  Calls him every day.
[37:29.080 --> 37:33.040]  Let's just say I make sure this information does get to the president.
[37:33.040 --> 37:38.520]  But we know they're committing a mass crime.
[37:38.520 --> 37:40.440]  We know they already tried to overthrow the last election.
[37:40.440 --> 37:45.720]  Now they're telling us in war games that are in the New York Times nine weeks ago that
[37:45.720 --> 37:50.880]  they're going to contest the election, hold the economy hostage, burn down the cities,
[37:50.880 --> 37:55.400]  say Trump's illegitimate, have Democrat judges say it's illegitimate all over the country
[37:55.400 --> 37:58.080]  filing new cases constantly.
[37:58.080 --> 38:01.360]  Even when the Supreme Court rules Trump's the president, they'll tell their constituents
[38:01.360 --> 38:02.360]  it's not legitimate.
[38:02.360 --> 38:04.560]  They're already going to think it's not legitimate.
[38:04.560 --> 38:10.040]  The stage is already set for that and then they're going to have states to cede.
[38:10.040 --> 38:13.200]  And then we're in an actual breakup of the country.
[38:13.200 --> 38:18.440]  And I'm simply saying with 36 days out, Trump has to come out and address the compendium
[38:18.440 --> 38:24.000]  of that and call the Democrats out directly for you know you're losing, you know you put
[38:24.000 --> 38:29.200]  out these unprecedented ballots and meld them to dead cats literally about 10 years ago.
[38:29.200 --> 38:32.800]  So you can hold things up and here's where Podesta said it and here's where Hillary said
[38:32.800 --> 38:38.000]  it and put out the ads that go like this.
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.160]  And we have all the documents and it's in the news we've covered it secretly over a
[38:42.160 --> 38:43.480]  year ago.
[38:43.480 --> 38:47.720]  Democrats began to approach the Pentagon and asked them to remove President Trump if he
[38:47.720 --> 38:52.480]  really won the 2020 election and then it goes on.
[38:52.480 --> 38:57.320]  The Pentagon said no, then they came to the Pentagon next and said well if he loses or
[38:57.320 --> 38:59.120]  refuses to go, will you get involved?
[38:59.120 --> 39:02.480]  The Pentagon then explained that was illegal, the unconstitutional was up to Congress, the
[39:02.480 --> 39:05.960]  American people in the courts.
[39:05.960 --> 39:10.720]  Then the Democrats went public and wrote a letter to the chair of the Joint Chiefs
[39:10.720 --> 39:17.760]  in June of 2020, asking them again to remove the president, forcing the chair of the Joint
[39:17.760 --> 39:23.120]  Chiefs of Staff, General Milley, to go public saying it was outrageous, illegal and criminal.
[39:23.120 --> 39:27.960]  Then by September, Democrats were saying that Trump planned to use the military to instill
[39:27.960 --> 39:31.920]  the election and that they demanded the military take action and not side with Trump.
[39:31.920 --> 39:35.080]  I mean that's what they're doing here.
[39:35.080 --> 39:38.760]  Now they're all over the news going oh the Pentagon's secretly planning to keep Trump
[39:38.760 --> 39:43.280]  in and have martial law because wait for it.
[39:43.280 --> 39:47.400]  When they activate the BLM and the Antifa and the operatives they've got, the BLM and
[39:47.400 --> 39:52.800]  Antifa just decoys for as Patsy just cover.
[39:52.800 --> 39:56.800]  They're going to say when the military has to get deployed, when you've got 10 times
[39:56.800 --> 40:03.960]  the burning you currently see, that that's Trump's martial law you see and trick everybody
[40:03.960 --> 40:05.840]  and then it's going to get even worse.
[40:05.840 --> 40:10.920]  And so they believe the crisis will be so big, oh here's the other part, they're going
[40:10.920 --> 40:21.680]  to drop the stock market 10,000, 15,000 points during the 79 days, I forgot that part.
[40:21.680 --> 40:25.480]  And then they're going to say all your pension funds are bad, nothing's worth anything and
[40:25.480 --> 40:32.560]  all the yuppies, even conservatives are going to be, I remember during the 2008 deal they
[40:32.560 --> 40:38.760]  plunged the markets to get Obama in and I went to a soccer game with one of my daughters,
[40:38.760 --> 40:44.680]  my middle daughter and Pee Wee Soccer and all the men had their newspapers out and I
[40:44.680 --> 40:46.760]  haven't watched the game just freaking out over their money.
[40:46.760 --> 40:52.680]  I walked over to them and I'd say hey, just as soon as Obama gets in, stop Martin and
[40:52.680 --> 40:58.680]  go back up and then they were like oh arrogant yuppies, oh you don't drive a BMW, I'm sure
[40:58.680 --> 41:03.600]  of my own, what do you know, I bet it never comes back because they're just shmucks, just
[41:03.600 --> 41:04.600]  airheads.
[41:04.600 --> 41:09.760]  They don't want to hear real data, real intel, you know, okay whatever, Obama's not worried
[41:09.760 --> 41:12.200]  at all plus I wasn't invested in all that crap.
[41:12.200 --> 41:17.200]  But they're going to hold this hostage and they're going to drop the stock market, I'd
[41:17.200 --> 41:22.760]  say by half, pull up, what's the stock market today, what's the Dow Jones industrial average
[41:22.760 --> 41:30.000]  on Friday's closing at 4 p.m. New York time, if you guys can pull that up, they'll drop
[41:30.000 --> 41:36.760]  it by, if they choose to, 50%.
[41:36.760 --> 41:45.720]  First they'll drop it by 20%, 30% and people say oh it's okay and then they'll drop it
[41:45.720 --> 41:51.560]  even more scary and the average American will roll over and piss themselves and say give
[41:51.560 --> 41:54.840]  us Joe Biden.
[41:54.840 --> 41:58.360]  And Bill Moore knows that's why he said last year and this year, I'm hoping for a crashing
[41:58.360 --> 42:04.280]  economy so we can get rid of Trump, bring on the recession and that's what they've done.
[42:04.280 --> 42:13.560]  So the stock market's at 27,173.96 on the Dow Jones industrial average.
[42:13.560 --> 42:21.040]  So yeah, my 15,000 point things, let me revise it, it'll drop by 13,500 points.
[42:21.040 --> 42:24.560]  And it's low.
[42:24.560 --> 42:30.000]  So it'll be down at, you know, 13, 14,000 and they're going to buy it all up, everybody's
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.360]  going to piss themselves and they're just going to remove Trump just like that unless
[42:34.360 --> 42:38.320]  we get out ahead of it now, because Americans actually aren't cowards.
[42:38.320 --> 42:42.000]  If they understand the truth of that and how they're being held hostage and Trump tells
[42:42.000 --> 42:46.000]  them when they hammer that market, we'll go to 50,000 after I get back in, they'll believe
[42:46.000 --> 42:47.000]  it'll happen.
[42:47.000 --> 42:52.440]  But they want the truth now, we need to call these enemies out for what they are enemies
[42:52.440 --> 42:58.480]  of our very existence, scum, trash, filth.
[42:58.480 --> 43:03.840]  This is your last chance to get a pack power stack and I'm really bummed out about that.
[43:03.840 --> 43:08.000]  It started out as a sleeper product, but the people that did order it loved it and sort
[43:08.000 --> 43:09.000]  of reordering it.
[43:09.000 --> 43:11.480]  They spread the word and became one of our best sellers.
[43:11.480 --> 43:16.280]  But because of the COVID supply chain breakdown, because there's 13 different formulas in
[43:16.280 --> 43:20.600]  an eight pack power stack, we are unable to secure it anymore.
[43:20.600 --> 43:26.080]  This is the highest end AMPM pack system you're going to find where you take half the pills
[43:26.080 --> 43:29.160]  in the morning, half the capitals and pills and shell caps at night.
[43:29.160 --> 43:30.160]  It's amazing.
[43:30.160 --> 43:33.320]  I don't have time to go into everything that's in it, but this gets people to remember to
[43:33.320 --> 43:37.000]  take it and that's why it's having such a great effect, because the stuff in here is
[43:37.000 --> 43:38.000]  absolutely amazing.
[43:38.000 --> 43:42.600]  So it's your last chance to get eight pack power stack, nip4store.com, it's 60% off and
[43:42.600 --> 43:46.640]  free shipping that is at cost for all of you that already supported infowars, we're passing
[43:46.640 --> 43:50.840]  these savings onto you, get your eight pack power stack now or you still can, last chance
[43:50.840 --> 43:58.240]  to get it, infowarsstore.com, eight pack power stack, 60% off and free shipping.
[43:58.240 --> 44:02.520]  The way the psychological warfare operation works is very, very simple.
[44:02.520 --> 44:05.560]  They get you to give up freedoms by increments.
[44:05.560 --> 44:09.160]  Always promising it's only going to be a short period of time and then the restrictions will
[44:09.160 --> 44:15.120]  be released, but they're not, that for a significant amount of time, always four or five times
[44:15.120 --> 44:19.840]  longer than what they said, they will then slightly release it a little bit, only tighten
[44:19.840 --> 44:21.320]  it down even more later.
[44:21.320 --> 44:27.720]  This is called successive approximation incrementalism or the inchworm effect.
[44:27.720 --> 44:32.200]  This is the most common way that the salitarians take over, but there then becomes a point
[44:32.200 --> 44:37.000]  where the public wakes up under the incrementalism, he starts resisting and then there's usually
[44:37.000 --> 44:42.080]  a giant purge and a clamp down and you'll see more tyranny rolled out in just a few
[44:42.080 --> 44:45.000]  days, weeks or months that you saw in the previous 10 years.
[44:45.000 --> 44:51.600]  And that's the period we're in globally right now, a world government, chai combat, globalist
[44:51.600 --> 44:56.520]  corporate takeover of the planet that wants you poor and absolutely sick under their thumb
[44:56.520 --> 44:57.520]  forever.
[44:57.520 --> 45:01.800]  I've got some bad news for you, then I've got some really bad news and then I've got
[45:01.800 --> 45:03.520]  some good news.
[45:03.520 --> 45:08.040]  The bad news is, even if Trump gets reelected, they're going to still trigger attempts at
[45:08.040 --> 45:11.880]  martial law, medical lockdowns, race riots and a depression.
[45:11.880 --> 45:14.760]  That's the globalists, they're trying to bring America to our knees.
[45:14.760 --> 45:19.480]  Now if Trump doesn't get elected, they're still planning to bring us to our knees and
[45:19.480 --> 45:24.160]  really try to break our will and bring us into a super intense depression, total control
[45:24.160 --> 45:28.520]  and like Australia's already doing, rounding up and arresting people that criticize what
[45:28.520 --> 45:30.240]  the left are doing.
[45:30.240 --> 45:31.240]  That's the really bad news.
[45:31.240 --> 45:35.240]  The good news is, this has triggered people out of their sleep all over the world and
[45:35.240 --> 45:38.680]  the resistance is mounting and the globalists are panicking.
[45:38.680 --> 45:42.840]  So bottom line, we're in the fight, we're starting to win, but it's serious.
[45:42.840 --> 45:47.480]  So pray to God for a global awakening, support InfoWars, spread the word and buy products
[45:47.480 --> 45:48.480]  at InfoWarsTour.com.
[45:48.480 --> 45:53.280]  Literally, we're having an emergency keep InfoWars sale happening right now.
[45:53.280 --> 45:58.720]  Please visit InfoWarsTour and keep us on air, thanks so much.
[45:58.720 --> 46:08.040]  It's the evening of September 26th, 2020 and I just got done watching the horrible footage
[46:08.040 --> 46:15.120]  of thousands of riot police with trojans beating thousands of peaceful people in Trafalgar's
[46:15.120 --> 46:20.640]  Square, protesting the COVID martial law lockdown.
[46:20.640 --> 46:25.640]  An iron curtain is descending over the world from the United Nations, even more evil than
[46:25.640 --> 46:27.120]  the old Soviet Union.
[46:27.120 --> 46:29.960]  And it's a model as communist China.
[46:29.960 --> 46:37.960]  We're not facing incremental tyranny, we're facing absolute 100% commitment to evil because
[46:37.960 --> 46:41.680]  the system thinks we're weak and thinks we're stupid and it's making us move.
[46:41.680 --> 46:45.240]  And whether it's Australia, the UK or the US, Black Lives Matter funded by Soros can
[46:45.240 --> 46:49.280]  run around and kill cops and burn things down and they're heroes and oh, nobody's worried
[46:49.280 --> 46:53.480]  about the COVID BS, but when it's patriots saying we have rights, we have dignity, they
[46:53.480 --> 46:54.680]  get viciously attacked.
[46:54.680 --> 47:01.840]  All of the videos are at infowars.com with David Ike speaking and more.
[47:01.840 --> 47:05.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:05.760 --> 47:21.920]  All right, you found it, the tip of the spear, thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen.
[47:21.920 --> 47:26.480]  I've got tons of entertaining Antifa clips, I've got all sorts of funny videos about all
[47:26.480 --> 47:30.160]  this cutesy stuff, but you know what, I'm not covering all that, this is a broadcast
[47:30.160 --> 47:36.040]  for really serious people who want to know what I think is going on and what the score
[47:36.040 --> 47:42.160]  is and what our guests think and what the callers think and want to get ready for it.
[47:42.160 --> 47:48.000]  And I like to have a little bit of fun too because in that process we don't kill ourselves
[47:48.000 --> 47:49.000]  or kill others.
[47:49.000 --> 47:52.840]  In fact, you know what, before I play this McMaster clip and the David Ike clip, let's
[47:52.840 --> 47:58.360]  go ahead and play, when I play at the start of the show, CNN in front of the Supreme Court
[47:58.360 --> 48:03.480]  can't even open their lying dirty mouths without the public chiming in and almost everybody
[48:03.480 --> 48:05.760]  in the crowd screaming fake news, fake news.
[48:05.760 --> 48:10.160]  I mean, we are rejecting the system, that's why they've gone with this desperate lockdown,
[48:10.160 --> 48:13.800]  this desperate martial law, this desperate attempt to kill our economy.
[48:13.800 --> 48:16.640]  They're trying to hold us hostage and I'm telling you, they're going to try to bring
[48:16.640 --> 48:21.800]  down the stock market to blame it on Trump, to blame it on America, to panic us when they're
[48:21.800 --> 48:23.360]  contesting the election.
[48:23.360 --> 48:29.840]  They're going to wait until they're contesting, that's their final move.
[48:29.840 --> 48:36.840]  The crash is going to come during the contention, bet your bottom dollar on it.
[48:36.840 --> 48:41.080]  That's the right move by the enemy.
[48:41.080 --> 48:45.560]  We have research, we have divine providence, we have discernment that our good Lord gave
[48:45.560 --> 48:51.000]  us, I suggest all of us use it, but once you heard me say that, you all know that's the
[48:51.000 --> 48:55.720]  move, you already knew that, you probably already said it yourself.
[48:55.720 --> 48:58.960]  This isn't rocket science, but you've got to face the facts.
[48:58.960 --> 49:02.040]  You can't be a lemon, you can't have Stockholm syndrome.
[49:02.040 --> 49:06.680]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip of what happened to CNN yesterday.
[49:06.680 --> 49:10.240]  But justice on the Supreme Court, over the next 30 or 40 years.
[49:10.240 --> 49:11.240]  Right?
[49:11.240 --> 49:12.240]  Well, absolutely.
[49:12.240 --> 49:19.240]  I just wanted to say that while we were here, the crowd behind us, Trump supporters, started
[49:19.240 --> 49:26.240]  to come from this room, you can hear them getting a little bit of news here, it's a
[49:26.240 --> 49:28.240]  crowd of Trump supporters.
[49:28.240 --> 49:31.760]  Arianna, I want you to stand by, we can barely hear what you're saying because of the crowd
[49:31.760 --> 49:32.760]  behind you.
[49:32.760 --> 49:33.760]  That's enough.
[49:33.760 --> 49:34.760]  Maybe.
[49:34.760 --> 49:40.760]  Since I mentioned it, here's McMaster, military will have no role in transition, X-Trump National
[49:40.760 --> 49:43.880]  Security Advisor says on NBC's Meet the Press.
[49:43.880 --> 49:49.640]  Now, notice in the articles and in the video and on Twitter, they act like Trump wants
[49:49.640 --> 49:51.520]  the military to do this.
[49:51.520 --> 49:56.840]  But in actuality, the Pentagon had to put out a report in August of last month.
[49:56.840 --> 50:03.360]  Top U.S. generals tell Congress the military won't play a role in the U.S. election.
[50:03.360 --> 50:07.040]  I had a whole report on that.
[50:07.040 --> 50:11.920]  But notice the spin from Yahoo News, French news agency, AP, what if Trump loses but won't
[50:11.920 --> 50:12.920]  concede?
[50:12.920 --> 50:15.040]  How close is this crisis could play out?
[50:15.040 --> 50:19.840]  And it goes on to say, when the Democrats can test, if he won't admit he's defeated,
[50:19.840 --> 50:26.200]  wait, wait, when the Democrats can test and he doesn't admit he's defeated.
[50:26.200 --> 50:31.800]  So wait a minute, when they can test, he loses, oh, I've got it.
[50:31.800 --> 50:35.960]  That's their new semantics, two plus two equals 50 or zero.
[50:35.960 --> 50:41.480]  I mean, this is clown world, right here.
[50:41.480 --> 50:45.760]  The constitutional crisis could play out to the president, be defeated and persuade his
[50:45.760 --> 50:49.760]  allies to join him in rejecting the vote tallies.
[50:49.760 --> 50:50.760]  That's another thing.
[50:50.760 --> 50:56.440]  They may just have the media because they've already said the media and Zuckerberg and
[50:56.440 --> 51:01.360]  Tim Cook and Apple and all the big tech heads are not going to allow the Republicans or
[51:01.360 --> 51:07.200]  Trump or his supporters to say that President Trump has won.
[51:07.200 --> 51:10.840]  Even though it's 11 o'clock at night and 97% of the ballots are counted and you can do
[51:10.840 --> 51:15.680]  the math projection of what's not counted and see he wins, they're going to hold it
[51:15.680 --> 51:20.840]  up with that one or two percent forever saying, the law is every ballot's counted.
[51:20.840 --> 51:24.160]  And we created all these ballots and then people send them in late on purpose.
[51:24.160 --> 51:26.360]  And that's the whole game plan.
[51:26.360 --> 51:30.200]  It's not steal the election with the fake ballots.
[51:30.200 --> 51:31.960]  They know the landslides too big.
[51:31.960 --> 51:36.640]  It's hold it up and create a stock market crash.
[51:36.640 --> 51:41.600]  But that's that told us what the plan is.
[51:41.600 --> 51:48.240]  Or they plan B as they, and Trump's on to plan A. So they may go plan B and just say
[51:48.240 --> 51:52.920]  Trump loses, even the numbers don't show it and then have all the major media announce
[51:52.920 --> 51:57.880]  it and then say Trump's insane if him and his quote allies, which the Washington Post
[51:57.880 --> 51:58.880]  said will be arrested.
[51:58.880 --> 52:07.560]  If members of the cabinet do not immediately say that Trump really lost when the Democrats
[52:07.560 --> 52:10.760]  say so, the you will be, you will spend time in prison.
[52:10.760 --> 52:13.640]  That was the headline.
[52:13.640 --> 52:18.320]  So the Democrats, again, I'm going to say it, the Democrats say we will contest no matter
[52:18.320 --> 52:22.440]  what, close quote, Hillary, Rodham Clinton, we will contest no matter what, we will contest
[52:22.440 --> 52:26.200]  no matter what, we will contest no matter what.
[52:26.200 --> 52:31.760]  Trump goes, all our internal polls and battleground state show, we're going to win the electoral
[52:31.760 --> 52:36.880]  probably the popular landslide, but you know, I'm not sure about you with all these weird
[52:36.880 --> 52:37.880]  ballots.
[52:37.880 --> 52:39.720]  They're like, oh my God, you're the integrity of the election.
[52:39.720 --> 52:40.880]  You're questioning it.
[52:40.880 --> 52:43.240]  They're the ones saying there's no integrity.
[52:43.240 --> 52:46.920]  They're the ones saying Russians got Trump elected.
[52:46.920 --> 52:48.800]  So this is their whole play.
[52:48.800 --> 52:49.800]  One of two things.
[52:49.800 --> 52:53.120]  They fraudulently announced he loses, even though the evidence doesn't show it because
[52:53.120 --> 52:57.400]  they have the whole media say it, oh, this is so big.
[52:57.400 --> 53:01.520]  Remember Obama put an internet kill switch in where only selective sites will be allowed
[53:01.520 --> 53:05.800]  to be heard, selective groups where the internet is only a few channels.
[53:05.800 --> 53:07.520]  Wherever you go, you're basically fed the same thing.
[53:07.520 --> 53:10.280]  They can superimpose it over the screen.
[53:10.280 --> 53:13.200]  People find those videos and they go, how did Jones predict they'd start doing this?
[53:13.200 --> 53:14.520]  I didn't predict it.
[53:14.520 --> 53:17.200]  They said they would do it.
[53:17.200 --> 53:18.280]  And this is internet kill switch.
[53:18.280 --> 53:24.080]  We're now Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, all of them are announcing.
[53:24.080 --> 53:30.200]  We will not let Trump, Republicans or any of his supporters, where they already have
[53:30.200 --> 53:35.480]  keywords blocked, say he won or debate it or show numbers that he really won, just like
[53:35.480 --> 53:39.600]  they won't let medical doctors come out and say, oh, hydroxychloroquine helps COVID or
[53:39.600 --> 53:41.760]  vitamin C or vitamin D.
[53:41.760 --> 53:47.040]  That was all a drill for this, just like every major media outlet starting with Apple.
[53:47.040 --> 53:48.040]  They always leave the pack.
[53:48.040 --> 53:56.840]  First abandon me, first Apple, then Google, then Twitter, then Facebook, all came out
[53:56.840 --> 54:04.560]  and put out the same reports at the same time on issue after issue after issue.
[54:04.560 --> 54:07.560]  And now they're doing that again with the election.
[54:07.560 --> 54:11.960]  Remember how they all came out with black lives matter, what they call blackouts, where
[54:11.960 --> 54:18.480]  they would only on Spotify or only on Apple Music or only on YouTube or only on Twitter,
[54:18.480 --> 54:23.440]  put out black artists as if they care about black people, leftist black artists, the shield
[54:23.440 --> 54:24.440]  of the big corporation.
[54:24.440 --> 54:27.360]  Oh, we took your Spotify account over.
[54:27.360 --> 54:29.840]  We took your YouTube over.
[54:29.840 --> 54:35.640]  We took your thing over that was all a drill to get all of Silicon Valley working in tandem
[54:35.640 --> 54:39.200]  to put the same thing out at the same time.
[54:39.200 --> 54:47.680]  And now they've announced starting on election day, we will not let a list of hundreds of
[54:47.680 --> 54:51.440]  millions of people comment that we think are affiliated with Russian bots.
[54:51.440 --> 54:52.600]  That's their cover.
[54:52.600 --> 54:56.360]  And I said months ago, I said, folks, in the final weeks of the election, they're going
[54:56.360 --> 55:00.760]  to dial back Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, they're going to be shadow band just like
[55:00.760 --> 55:07.600]  I was and what happened two days ago, Tucker Carlson cut back 98% Sean Hannity 98% reach
[55:07.600 --> 55:11.480]  just shut down to where if you only go to their page, you can find what they're saying.
[55:11.480 --> 55:12.480]  There is no reach.
[55:12.480 --> 55:13.920]  You cannot promote their stuff.
[55:13.920 --> 55:14.920]  You try to promote it.
[55:14.920 --> 55:16.040]  It goes nowhere.
[55:16.040 --> 55:18.000]  See how that works.
[55:18.000 --> 55:21.960]  And if you look at the articles from like three years ago, before we got totally banned,
[55:21.960 --> 55:28.600]  what were the headlines info or shadow banned 98% and we found hundreds of other sites have
[55:28.600 --> 55:37.560]  been shadow banned 98% they've already beta tested every single bit of this.
[55:37.560 --> 55:42.360]  And now on election day, they're going to shut everybody down and they won't even send
[55:42.360 --> 55:43.360]  you notifications.
[55:43.360 --> 55:44.360]  You violate anything.
[55:44.360 --> 55:47.600]  You think you're going to say something to your group of 100 people on Facebook or your
[55:47.600 --> 55:49.240]  Twitter with a thousand people.
[55:49.240 --> 55:56.200]  No, you're going to be sending messages and no one's going to see them.
[55:56.200 --> 56:02.600]  Unless you're at band.video or m4works.com or newsworks.com, but here's what you do.
[56:02.600 --> 56:07.920]  You create dummy accounts the night before using a different cell phone, different ID
[56:07.920 --> 56:11.760]  or you just pick an area where you're going to go out live on the streets, especially
[56:11.760 --> 56:12.760]  if you're in a key city.
[56:12.760 --> 56:16.920]  You're going to jump in front of news cameras and you're going to be heard that way.
[56:16.920 --> 56:21.600]  That's what you've got to do is decide now before the band with 36 days how you're going
[56:21.600 --> 56:23.200]  to be heard about this band.
[56:23.200 --> 56:29.800]  Instead, we just let them come out and define this as a throttle on this info on Tucker Carlson.
[56:29.800 --> 56:35.360]  When he's not this info, when it's an internet kill switch, they've just been tightening it
[56:35.360 --> 56:39.800]  up, tightening it up, tightening it up, tightening it up, tightening it up, tightening it up,
[56:39.800 --> 56:43.560]  censoring the president's tweets, censoring the president's Facebooks, censoring Republican
[56:43.560 --> 56:44.560]  campaigns.
[56:44.560 --> 56:48.480]  And now telling you we've met with all the big tech heads and we've all agreed under
[56:48.480 --> 56:52.600]  the Southern Poverty Law Center that we're going to silence everything you say, including
[56:52.600 --> 56:53.600]  the attorney general.
[56:53.600 --> 56:57.880]  If the attorney general comes out and says something, we'll silence him because they're
[56:57.880 --> 57:02.760]  God, because they're exercising power, because we're laying down to them.
[57:02.760 --> 57:06.400]  Let's go out to break with this McMaster Club here at Ascot.
[57:06.400 --> 57:08.840]  Play the McMaster Club.
[57:08.840 --> 57:11.120]  I want to start with these reports.
[57:11.120 --> 57:13.680]  We've had our own reporting here at NBC News, The New York Times.
[57:13.680 --> 57:17.520]  I'm sure you're familiar with both of them and that there's been a bit of hand-wringing
[57:17.520 --> 57:23.800]  among senior leadership in the military about what if and the fact that the president did
[57:23.800 --> 57:29.920]  bring up the Insurrection Act once already, what can you share and what concerns do you
[57:29.920 --> 57:30.920]  have?
[57:30.920 --> 57:35.360]  Well, Chuck, I think what is really clear for the American people to understand is the
[57:35.360 --> 57:38.040]  military will have no role in a transition.
[57:38.040 --> 57:41.440]  In fact, even talk about it, I think, is irresponsible.
[57:41.440 --> 57:42.960]  And that's maybe why...
[57:42.960 --> 57:45.560]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[57:45.560 --> 57:48.360]  Hour two, straight ahead.
[57:48.360 --> 57:53.200]  Last week, Tucker Carlson came out and said America is becoming the Soviet Union.
[57:53.200 --> 57:55.960]  In many ways, we're worse than the Soviet Union.
[57:55.960 --> 58:00.640]  The Soviet Union couldn't dream of what Big Tech could do, surveilling and censoring us.
[58:00.640 --> 58:04.400]  And we're going to get a lot worse than the Soviet Union when it comes to forced inoculations
[58:04.400 --> 58:09.120]  and the medical tyranny being rolled out by the United Nations now in control of what
[58:09.120 --> 58:11.200]  you can and can't say online.
[58:11.200 --> 58:14.880]  The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, America is fighting for its life.
[58:14.880 --> 58:20.000]  And the enemy's number one mission is to get Trump out of office and number two is to silence
[58:20.000 --> 58:25.160]  Infowars because we understand just how diabolical they are, just how evil they are.
[58:25.160 --> 58:26.880]  And we want Mitt's words.
[58:26.880 --> 58:28.600]  We know who the globalists are.
[58:28.600 --> 58:29.600]  We've got their number.
[58:29.600 --> 58:30.600]  And we know how to beat them.
[58:30.600 --> 58:36.120]  And we cover it seven days a week live at Infowars, and it's only because of your support.
[58:36.120 --> 58:39.520]  So keep spreading the word, keep praying for us, and take advantage of the sales and get
[58:39.520 --> 58:42.160]  great products at InfowarsStore.com now.
[58:42.160 --> 58:49.600]  The globalists were hoping you don't visit InfowarsStore.com.
[58:49.600 --> 58:54.880]  I don't want to be negative about the prospects of the election, but I need to be honest with
[58:54.880 --> 58:55.880]  everybody.
[58:55.880 --> 59:00.520]  The Democrats and their deep state controllers, Communist Chinese, have come out and said
[59:00.520 --> 59:01.520]  they're going to contest the election.
[59:01.520 --> 59:03.960]  They know that Trump's going to win the landslide.
[59:03.960 --> 59:08.520]  And the destabilization that that's going to cause is going to further destroy the markets
[59:08.520 --> 59:13.000]  and the economy, and going into the future, even if Trump is able to prove that he's won
[59:13.000 --> 59:14.000]  the election.
[59:14.000 --> 59:19.840]  The Democrats have said they're going to break away politically and culturally into the
[59:19.840 --> 59:25.800]  blue states and blue cities and basically use that as a pretext of sabotage the republic
[59:25.800 --> 59:26.800]  even more.
[59:26.800 --> 59:32.760]  So until this cancer is rooted out, until these criminals that work with foreign governments
[59:32.760 --> 59:37.000]  that are trying to basically destroy the country are punished and removed, it's just
[59:37.000 --> 59:39.000]  going to continue to happen.
[59:39.000 --> 59:44.320]  And so that's the big problem here, is that we have stemming, dug-in corruption by people
[59:44.320 --> 59:51.360]  that hate the country's very existence.
[59:51.360 --> 59:54.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[59:54.960 --> 1:00:07.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're unpacking shields, we are flipping tables, we're pulling out
[1:00:07.320 --> 1:00:08.320]  sorrow signs.
[1:00:08.320 --> 1:00:09.320]  You know what that means.
[1:00:09.320 --> 1:00:10.320]  It's Friday night.
[1:00:10.320 --> 1:00:11.320]  Antifa Smackdown.
[1:00:11.320 --> 1:00:16.480]  And as you can see, Antifa is red and ready to go on this Friday night.
[1:00:16.480 --> 1:00:21.640]  They've got tons of signs, they've got trash can lids, plywood that they're dumbing as
[1:00:21.640 --> 1:00:22.640]  shields.
[1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:25.920]  They've got their work boots on, and now you can see here, they're outside the precinct,
[1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:29.480]  they're trying to play Red Rover, it appears with a police vehicle.
[1:00:29.480 --> 1:00:32.360]  This is not going to go well for them, the police are being telling them right now, one
[1:00:32.360 --> 1:00:37.040]  of the commies has pajama pants on, and line them up, line them up police, and there they
[1:00:37.040 --> 1:00:38.040]  go.
[1:00:38.040 --> 1:00:41.360]  You can see they've got the automatic hanger, oh, and the whole line goes down, and now they're
[1:00:41.360 --> 1:00:45.120]  just confused, they're still in it, let go, but they're all on the ground writhing, and
[1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:48.320]  this police officer, oh, he's just having fun at this point, points out his target, lights
[1:00:48.320 --> 1:00:53.320]  him up, 100% accuracy, points out his next target, that's you, stiff arm to the ground,
[1:00:53.320 --> 1:00:57.760]  full mount, and this commie's calling for mommy, now, oh, he's writhing on the ground,
[1:00:57.760 --> 1:01:03.120]  like a little bitch, oh, and he's crying for mommy, no, mommy's not coming to get you,
[1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:08.200]  as you can see here in the slow motion replay, incredible accuracy from the officer, fires
[1:01:08.200 --> 1:01:12.640]  about six shots, every single one of them hitting the dirtbag, commie, not a single
[1:01:12.640 --> 1:01:16.880]  one hitting his fellow officer, as you can see the officers have their knees on the faces
[1:01:16.880 --> 1:01:22.440]  of the commie scum, and they're gonna be roughed up, I think they may need bandages and novocaine,
[1:01:22.440 --> 1:01:26.040]  as they're twisted up in pretzels as their little game of red rover fails, and their
[1:01:26.040 --> 1:01:32.360]  buddy cries like a bitch for mommy, well, it appears maybe the communists have had enough,
[1:01:32.360 --> 1:01:36.400]  and so they wanna try to reach a deal here, let's hear the proposal, don't go back to
[1:01:36.400 --> 1:01:43.560]  fuck up, we gon' back to fuck up, no, we said to fuck up, all right, it appears no deal
[1:01:43.560 --> 1:01:47.800]  has been reached, nope, not indeed, the police officer said, no, here's our deal, why don't
[1:01:47.800 --> 1:01:51.720]  you get the hell out of here, and we'll give you some bumps and bruises along the way,
[1:01:51.720 --> 1:01:56.360]  and just listen to the people's fire, rapid rate right here, I mean, hundreds of rounds
[1:01:56.360 --> 1:02:02.000]  being fired, eat paint, commie, as these police officers aren't gonna have any of this, now
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:05.560]  you can see the police, I think they may be enjoying this, I think I may have seen one
[1:02:05.560 --> 1:02:10.480]  of them smiling, as the media standing by filming this beautiful exchange, laughing
[1:02:10.480 --> 1:02:18.200]  in the light, as the dirtbag commies scatter like cockroaches, we've got a lady here, she
[1:02:18.200 --> 1:02:22.480]  is upset that Antifa is getting beat up in the street, she's flicking off the police
[1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:28.000]  officers, now leaning out of her car and slams into the car in front of her, oh how embarrassing,
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:32.280]  and now she's frustrated, banging her hands against the steering wheel, Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
[1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:36.640]  her hero is now dead, she has not had a very good day, and now she's gonna have to pay
[1:02:36.640 --> 1:02:41.400]  some damages out, to the car in front of her, probably maybe even totaled her own car,
[1:02:41.400 --> 1:02:46.200]  she's slamming onto the steering wheel, screaming, oh, and it just got in worse, the cops are
[1:02:46.200 --> 1:02:51.240]  already on the scene, let's hear what this method has to say, what the fuck is it, you
[1:02:51.240 --> 1:02:58.520]  fucking dumbass, don't fucking come near me, are you done, no I'm not done at all, you're
[1:02:58.520 --> 1:03:07.360]  the one that, oh, taste a little bit of that, right to the, oh look at the form, the lean
[1:03:07.360 --> 1:03:12.880]  in with the right hand, keeping the arm straight, all right, president trump now heading to
[1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:18.200]  marine one to catch the latest Antifa Friday Night Smack, oh, oh what a save, what a save
[1:03:18.200 --> 1:03:24.120]  by bonus, oh my gosh, it's a save of the day, queen Melania was about to go down, her heel
[1:03:24.120 --> 1:03:30.120]  was caught in the grass, and 45 with the save of the day, oh, ladies and gentlemen, you
[1:03:30.120 --> 1:03:35.160]  know that president trump and queen Melania like to catch Friday Night Antifa Smackdown
[1:03:35.160 --> 1:03:41.120]  in marine one, and Melania trump almost went down, but 45 had her, oh, he's a true hero,
[1:03:41.120 --> 1:03:47.840]  unbelievable, as he gets on marine one, the salute, and oh, total victory as president
[1:03:47.840 --> 1:03:56.920]  trump is about to watch Antifa Friday Night Smackdown, all right, we've got a fairy here,
[1:03:56.920 --> 1:04:00.720]  we've got an Antifa fairy, seems to be lost from the crowd, but that's not going to stop
[1:04:00.720 --> 1:04:05.400]  him, he still wants to stop traffic, oh that's not a match, you can win, oh then flailing
[1:04:05.400 --> 1:04:10.360]  at the car, his Harry Potter wand goes flying, oh, and this guy's come out of the driver's
[1:04:10.360 --> 1:04:16.080]  seat, and into the street, and he has a full mount, oh, one, two, three right hooks, three
[1:04:16.080 --> 1:04:20.480]  right hooks, oh, four with the freedom smash to the face, he asked him if he wants more
[1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:26.320]  left hook for good measure, and good night, Irene, it's novocaine time, and take your
[1:04:26.320 --> 1:04:32.360]  stupid wand with ya, well, that's going to be the Smackdown of the week, let's look
[1:04:32.360 --> 1:04:38.640]  at the slow motion replay, one, two, three fifths to the face, fourth for good measure,
[1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:42.440]  and a little left hook just to let him know where he lies, and at the end of this you
[1:04:42.440 --> 1:04:48.040]  can see, he says, hey, your stupid Harry Potter wand, take that home with you too, all right
[1:04:48.040 --> 1:04:52.320]  ladies and gentlemen, it's been another epic Friday night, and Tifa sir, we'll be right
[1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:57.200]  back with Robert Barnes.
[1:04:57.200 --> 1:05:02.840]  In the area during the pandemic, we looked to local health authorities, so for example
[1:05:02.840 --> 1:05:09.000]  in the US it would be CDC for guidelines around medical misinformation in a narrow way which
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:11.640]  could cause harm in the real world.
[1:05:11.640 --> 1:05:16.920]  That was a few months ago and the CEO of Google Sundar Pichai made a very important statement,
[1:05:16.920 --> 1:05:20.840]  all the other big tech heads made the exact same statement, because it comes out of the
[1:05:20.840 --> 1:05:26.440]  UN, that they follow the guidance of the WHO and or local government, what they need is
[1:05:26.440 --> 1:05:30.440]  in the United States, other areas of the world, cities that have been unionized or that have
[1:05:30.440 --> 1:05:35.080]  actually signed on to UN memorandums and agreements, so what he's saying is, oh, we follow the
[1:05:35.080 --> 1:05:39.000]  United Nations or the global government, and then we've got little stakeholder parents,
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:43.560]  that's how the UN works, that then give the illusion of it being local, but then when
[1:05:43.560 --> 1:05:48.680]  your doctors or your scientists or virologists come out and say that COVID-19 has massively
[1:05:48.680 --> 1:05:53.640]  exaggerated the power grab, they get silenced, their press conferences get muzzled, just
[1:05:53.640 --> 1:06:01.320]  like they do in Communist China, that's what's really going on here.
[1:06:01.320 --> 1:06:06.200]  When I grow up, I will defeat the new world order global government project and relaunch
[1:06:06.200 --> 1:06:15.160]  the renaissance, we are live, September 27th, 2020, on this Sunday, 36 days out of the election,
[1:06:15.160 --> 1:06:20.120]  114 for the inauguration, you can't fuck this, especially the night, this isn't fantasy,
[1:06:20.120 --> 1:06:26.680]  this is a fiction, this is game time for the future of humanity.
[1:06:26.680 --> 1:06:33.080]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the resistance,
[1:06:33.080 --> 1:06:38.120]  you're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:06:38.120 --> 1:06:44.280]  We only bet on winners here, and Trump is going to win.
[1:06:44.280 --> 1:06:48.360]  The establishment is going to try to contest the election, scuttle the country,
[1:06:48.360 --> 1:06:52.920]  and crash the stock market, I forget, I predict, and Robert Barnes will give us his take on that
[1:06:52.920 --> 1:07:01.800]  coming up next segment, but because real candor is our maxim here, and I don't want to be pushing
[1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:07.240]  hope among people, we've got a problem, and obviously I'm going to end up supporting the
[1:07:07.240 --> 1:07:10.760]  nomination because the Democrats are going to try to block it, they would put somebody in
[1:07:10.760 --> 1:07:16.680]  probably even worse, at least she's anti-abortion, but she is for forced inauguration, I didn't
[1:07:16.680 --> 1:07:20.360]  just believe constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes is a really smart guy and a friend of mine,
[1:07:20.360 --> 1:07:24.920]  I didn't think he was lying, but I got the decision that she did a few months ago,
[1:07:24.920 --> 1:07:30.120]  I went and looked it up, I read the decision Friday night, I'd already heard about this
[1:07:30.120 --> 1:07:39.960]  weeks ago, and I went and I pulled it all up, and the new Supreme Court nominee supports and
[1:07:41.080 --> 1:07:46.280]  why don't we just have Robert Barnes tell us, and again the Democrats are already saying killer,
[1:07:46.280 --> 1:07:52.600]  they hate her, blah blah blah, I don't like them, I'm not trying to join them, I'm not saying don't
[1:07:53.160 --> 1:07:59.400]  confirm her, I'm just saying my god, I wish I'd have been on this earlier, and we'd have been
[1:07:59.400 --> 1:08:03.960]  hammering this harder to get to the president because I know the president means well, and now
[1:08:03.960 --> 1:08:08.040]  they've got, well they're going to have five justices, she's going to join the Democrats
[1:08:08.600 --> 1:08:13.960]  in forced inauguration and lock-downs, which she just ruled on, I've got the articles right here,
[1:08:13.960 --> 1:08:20.440]  so Amy Coney Barrett, constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes, tell us what we're dealing with here.
[1:08:21.560 --> 1:08:27.080]  Sure, so the authoritarian wing of the Federalist Society and some of those folks
[1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:33.640]  really were shocked back in late May when four Supreme Court justices, Justice Gorsuch, Justice
[1:08:33.640 --> 1:08:39.720]  Alito, Justice Thomas, and Justice Kavanaugh, all said that basically we're calling the lock-downs
[1:08:39.720 --> 1:08:44.680]  unconstitutional, and in particular they went out of their way to reject a decision called the
[1:08:44.680 --> 1:08:51.080]  Jacobson case, which is the forced vaccination case that was being used to justify the mask mandates
[1:08:51.080 --> 1:08:57.640]  and the lock-down. And that's from 1905, right? That's exactly right, and so their point was
[1:08:57.640 --> 1:09:02.840]  that this decision, the Jacobson decision is no longer governing law and is not the guiding star,
[1:09:03.960 --> 1:09:09.640]  so that made some authoritarian types nervous on the pro-lockdown side of the aisle, and so they
[1:09:09.640 --> 1:09:16.280]  went out looking for a judge who could replace Ginsburg if she were to pass away before the
[1:09:16.280 --> 1:09:24.200]  election. And on the list of the 22 judges that the president was considering, only one
[1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:29.480]  had supported the lock-down, and that was Judge Barrett. And Judge Barrett not only supported
[1:09:29.480 --> 1:09:36.120]  the lock-down, she cited the Jacobson decision as good governing law. So now she was signaling
[1:09:36.120 --> 1:09:41.240]  a well-known eugenics case that allowed the health departments, the sterilization, the eugenics,
[1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:44.680]  she was signaling, hey, I'll go against the court, she was shaking a tail feather.
[1:09:44.680 --> 1:09:51.800]  Exactly. And what I tell people is what's the likelihood that the only one of the 22 people
[1:09:51.800 --> 1:09:57.400]  on Trump's list that has ever said anything pro-Jakobson or pro-lockdown is the one that's
[1:09:57.400 --> 1:10:02.600]  pushed onto Trump. So what they told Trump is that she would support him in the election because
[1:10:02.600 --> 1:10:09.160]  she was part of the Bush v. Gore team, and that's how they got Trump to go along with it. Trump's
[1:10:09.160 --> 1:10:13.080]  not been following the lockdown lawsuit in any detail or the forced vaccination case.
[1:10:13.080 --> 1:10:16.360]  Brother, I've been busy too. You're the one that told me about this a week and a half ago,
[1:10:16.360 --> 1:10:23.480]  and I was like, I mean, you can't track everything. And the Federalist Society has so much control
[1:10:23.480 --> 1:10:27.800]  over conservative media and conservative lawyers that none of them are willing to challenge it
[1:10:27.800 --> 1:10:32.120]  or contest it. I've taken a lot of heat from a lot of people just for pointing this out about
[1:10:32.120 --> 1:10:36.600]  Barrett. I'm not a lawyer, but I can usually find stuff in 30 seconds. After you sent me the name
[1:10:36.600 --> 1:10:41.000]  of the decision the other night when we talked, I put it around for like an hour trying to find
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:46.120]  anything about it. I finally found it that they have really suppressed it completely. And it's
[1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:51.160]  not a coincidence that, you know, that people like George Conway, Kellyanne Conway's husband who
[1:10:51.160 --> 1:10:56.680]  hates Trump has come out for Judge Barrett, that this was a Koch brother coup. So the Koch family
[1:10:56.680 --> 1:11:01.320]  put in massive amount of money and effort to make sure Barrett got the pick. And they're
[1:11:01.320 --> 1:11:05.480]  already spending more money than the Republican Party is to make sure she gets on the bench.
[1:11:05.480 --> 1:11:11.240]  And people who don't may not know the Koch family is big on their pro-immigration, actually.
[1:11:11.240 --> 1:11:15.640]  They're also big on protecting big tech. Oh, they've given more money to Democrats than to
[1:11:15.640 --> 1:11:20.760]  Republicans. That's a scythe that they're actually Republican operatives. Let's expand on that.
[1:11:20.760 --> 1:11:26.680]  They use fake libertarianism to just gut the country. Absolutely. They are the number one
[1:11:26.680 --> 1:11:32.600]  funders of the Federalist Society, the number one funders of Reason Magazine. And so they make sure
[1:11:32.600 --> 1:11:38.200]  that the libertarians support a corporatist, statist agenda. That's really been their objective
[1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:43.560]  for a long time. For example, they've refused to come out against masks. All the institutions
[1:11:43.560 --> 1:11:48.520]  funded by the Koch brothers haven't brought any of the lockdown lawsuits. So this is a major
[1:11:48.520 --> 1:11:54.040]  coup for the Koch brothers. What about this? Bill Barr, I know, was CIA high level and worked for
[1:11:54.040 --> 1:11:58.520]  George Herbert Walker and did some bad things. But since he's got in, overall, he's been better.
[1:11:58.520 --> 1:12:03.400]  I know you had questions about him, so I've been impressed overall. Still nothing on the Durham,
[1:12:03.400 --> 1:12:07.400]  still a lot of problems. But instead of an F minus, like I was thinking, more like a B minus,
[1:12:07.400 --> 1:12:13.240]  which I mean, I'm happy to get some crumbs here. Give me your view. Could she now that she has a
[1:12:13.240 --> 1:12:18.280]  different master? Could she be persuaded by the court? Could we make an issue out of this in
[1:12:18.280 --> 1:12:23.080]  confirmation instead of all the leftist talking points to get her to confirm that, you know,
[1:12:23.080 --> 1:12:29.640]  that she doesn't want to run sterilization camps and forced inoculation? I would hope that Republicans
[1:12:29.640 --> 1:12:35.000]  would put her on alert on this issue in the examination process. But I think the internal
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:39.960]  message has gone out that if anyone questions her, they'll be brutally attacked by the Federalist
[1:12:39.960 --> 1:12:45.320]  Society connected people, which are very influential in the legal conservative. So let's go back. I'm
[1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:48.680]  interrupting here because you're the brain on this. But let's go back to the Jacobson decision
[1:12:48.680 --> 1:12:52.840]  because I went and read the damn thing and it made me want to throw up Friday night. Tell folks
[1:12:52.840 --> 1:12:58.120]  about it. Jacobson is one of the worst decisions ever issued. It basically said that the 14th
[1:12:58.120 --> 1:13:02.600]  Amendment did not protect your liberties at all. This was back during the early 1900s when the
[1:13:02.600 --> 1:13:08.040]  Supreme Court was not enforcing constitutional liberties against the states. That that took
[1:13:08.040 --> 1:13:12.680]  the Civil Rights Act to start actually enforcing that again. And so what they said was that you
[1:13:12.680 --> 1:13:17.080]  could and in that case, all the person was asking for was an opportunity to have a hearing to show
[1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:21.960]  that the vaccine was dangerous and that he didn't need it. And they said he wasn't even entitled
[1:13:21.960 --> 1:13:27.000]  to a trial or a hearing on it. They said that if there is a public health, if a quote unquote
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:31.480]  public health emergency, that all the 14th Amendment, your all your constitutional rights are
[1:13:31.480 --> 1:13:36.680]  suspended. And that's what just Judge Barrett just signed off on in Illinois. I mean, the governor
[1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:42.200]  had banned all political gatherings based on your speech. And she said that's just fine because
[1:13:42.840 --> 1:13:48.040]  largely because Jacobson, she cited Jacobson to say you have no protected liberty under
[1:13:48.040 --> 1:13:53.480]  the 14th Amendment in the case of a public health emergency. And obviously the UN globally is
[1:13:53.480 --> 1:14:00.040]  literally taking over with contact tracing, control apps, forced inoculations, global starvation
[1:14:00.040 --> 1:14:04.840]  with this overriding archive. And I looked up the case. I'd heard about it before from
[1:14:04.840 --> 1:14:09.000]  Dr. Blalock. He mentioned it years ago on the show, the Jacobson case. That was funded by the
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:13.240]  Rockefellers who were taking over Western medicine at the time and thought the best way to control
[1:14:13.240 --> 1:14:17.880]  society would be through medicine. That's why when Hitler in the Nuremberg trials, the Nazis
[1:14:17.880 --> 1:14:24.200]  used Jacobson in the trial. I remember this, I looked it up last night, actually, that they'd
[1:14:24.200 --> 1:14:28.680]  actually use the arguments and that Margaret Sanger supported it, that this is how they set
[1:14:28.680 --> 1:14:34.760]  up the health departments, the forced sterilization. I mean, so much evil worldwide has been based on
[1:14:34.760 --> 1:14:38.360]  this Jacobson decision. And to have her being a supporter of it, that's pretty frightening.
[1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:44.280]  It's terrifying. And the fact that she was the only one on the list that could be,
[1:14:44.280 --> 1:14:49.960]  that was in favor of it, it makes it clear why she was picked. I mean, not by Trump, but why
[1:14:49.960 --> 1:14:54.200]  they were forced Trump to take her under the false pits that she would protect him in the
[1:14:54.200 --> 1:14:59.400]  election without really getting into these issues. Trump has become very isolated. He's not hearing
[1:14:59.400 --> 1:15:04.040]  a lot of his populist messages or populist audience, except when he goes on Twitter himself
[1:15:04.040 --> 1:15:08.600]  personally. And that's increasingly sporadic over the last month or so, in part due to the
[1:15:08.600 --> 1:15:14.600]  the nature of a schedule. And so Jacobson was the foundation for the buck decision,
[1:15:14.600 --> 1:15:19.080]  which was forced sterilizations and the peak of eugenics in America. It was the basis for
[1:15:19.080 --> 1:15:24.600]  the Korematsu decision, which was the detention camps in America. So Jacobson is the most dangerous
[1:15:24.600 --> 1:15:29.640]  decision ever issued in American constitutional legal history. It says if the medical court says
[1:15:29.640 --> 1:15:34.280]  that we can kill your ass, I mean, we can put you in a concentration camp. Jacobson was cited as
[1:15:34.280 --> 1:15:38.680]  the grounds for the forced draft. Jacobson was decided was cited as the grounds that you could
[1:15:38.680 --> 1:15:47.000]  kill Americans overseas for as enemy combatants. Jacobson is seen as one of the most evil rulings
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:51.480]  in U.S. history. There's been a lot of evil ones. And this lady just endorsed it in 2020.
[1:15:51.480 --> 1:15:53.080]  Man, you talk about shaking that tail feather.
[1:15:55.960 --> 1:15:59.320]  The way the psychological warfare operation works is very, very simple.
[1:15:59.320 --> 1:16:05.320]  They give up freedoms by increments, always promising it's only going to be a short period of time,
[1:16:05.880 --> 1:16:11.480]  and then the restrictions will be released, but they're not. They have a significant amount of
[1:16:11.480 --> 1:16:16.200]  time, always four or five times longer than what they said. They will then slightly release it a
[1:16:16.200 --> 1:16:21.640]  little bit, only tighten it down even more later. This is called successive approximation
[1:16:22.360 --> 1:16:26.920]  incrementalism or the inchworm effect. This is the most common way that the
[1:16:26.920 --> 1:16:32.440]  Salatarians take over, but there then becomes a point where the public wakes up under the
[1:16:32.440 --> 1:16:37.320]  incrementalism. He starts resisting, and then there's usually a giant purge and a clamp down,
[1:16:37.320 --> 1:16:41.720]  and you'll see more tyranny rolled out in just a few days, weeks or months that you saw in the
[1:16:41.720 --> 1:16:47.640]  previous 10 years. And that's the period we're in globally right now. A world government,
[1:16:47.640 --> 1:16:53.640]  chai combat, globalist corporate takeover of the planet that wants you poor and absolutely sick
[1:16:53.640 --> 1:17:02.680]  under their thumb forever. The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:17:10.840 --> 1:17:15.880]  Infowars has been banned, arrested,
[1:17:15.880 --> 1:17:27.000]  attacked, and threatened. Because we are effective. The great awakening is here.

[1:17:56.760 --> 1:18:04.200]  And perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, the complications from COVID-19,
[1:18:04.200 --> 1:18:12.760]  which are well beyond what they should be. It's estimated that 200 million people have died.
[1:18:13.480 --> 1:18:18.600]  200 million people have died. Probably by the time I finish this talk.
[1:18:19.160 --> 1:18:24.920]  Right after Joe Biden made that statement that more than 60% of America has died from COVID-19
[1:18:24.920 --> 1:18:30.040]  when it's not even 200,000 in reality, he would honestly say 6 million have lung scarring and
[1:18:30.040 --> 1:18:34.280]  heart damage. It's all made up. But you know where he got it? The mainstream media that continues to
[1:18:34.280 --> 1:18:41.160]  actually say things like that. They said that 4% of America would be dead already. Of course,
[1:18:41.160 --> 1:18:48.680]  it's 0.0000 and then add a number because the numbers vary. It's a real virus, just like people
[1:18:48.680 --> 1:18:54.600]  being struck by lightning is real. But to shut down society over lightning strikes is hysteria
[1:18:54.600 --> 1:19:00.360]  and is mind control. If you look at the top tech billionaires and the big banks that finance and
[1:19:00.360 --> 1:19:05.240]  control them, to a man and to a woman, they believe there's too many people on the earth and they
[1:19:05.240 --> 1:19:10.040]  constantly whine about when they want to go to a mountain top or a national park, they have to look
[1:19:10.040 --> 1:19:14.840]  at us, the common people. They have to look at the proletariat, they have to look at the scum.
[1:19:14.840 --> 1:19:19.480]  That's why they love the lockdown, putting muzzles on us. That gives them a big thrill,
[1:19:19.480 --> 1:19:25.080]  controlling where we can go, what we can do. Bankrupting main street, bankrupting small towns,
[1:19:25.080 --> 1:19:30.600]  all of it is a vertical integration, consolidation, so they can then dictate the terms of our total
[1:19:30.600 --> 1:19:37.240]  surrender, which is taking sterilant vaccines day one. Ladies and gentlemen, all the games are over,
[1:19:37.240 --> 1:19:42.360]  playtime's over. They used all the entertainment and garbage to put us into a trance and now the
[1:19:42.360 --> 1:19:47.640]  spider's moving in for the kill. You know this, I know this, it's all out in the open. The question
[1:19:47.640 --> 1:19:52.040]  is, what are we going to do about it? Well, the first thing is identify the enemy, identify the enemy,
[1:19:52.040 --> 1:19:55.240]  identify the enemy, identify your enemy now.
[1:19:55.240 --> 1:20:24.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:24.840 --> 1:20:28.760]  All right, I don't think it's a meet the new boss, same as the old boss, like the whose song goes.
[1:20:28.760 --> 1:20:32.280]  I know the globalists don't want Trump. I know Trump's done a lot of good things,
[1:20:32.840 --> 1:20:38.840]  but I'm not going to sit here like a mindless cheerleader when I see what's going on and I talk
[1:20:38.840 --> 1:20:45.160]  about it. So a couple of weeks ago, Barnes was talking about problems with Amy, Coney, Barrett,
[1:20:45.160 --> 1:20:48.680]  and I went and looked it up and I saw the nominee. He was talking about it later. They said was one
[1:20:48.680 --> 1:20:53.160]  of the runner-ups. Now look at the Koch brothers and I looked at this lady's rulings and I saw her
[1:20:53.160 --> 1:21:00.040]  with her kid. She's adopted Nasir, anti-abortion stance. I like all that. But then when it came to
[1:21:01.160 --> 1:21:07.880]  forced inoculations and eugenics and this case that's like reviled and was used in the Nuremberg
[1:21:07.880 --> 1:21:14.520]  trials by the Nazis, that was her signaling. I'm an authoritarian, something deeper than just
[1:21:14.520 --> 1:21:19.800]  the liberals, the Democratic Party, the real threat of that deep multinational corporate control
[1:21:19.800 --> 1:21:24.360]  that's in America that's allowed to sell out of the country to China, the open borders, all of it.
[1:21:24.360 --> 1:21:29.720]  So I want to get to some other issues with you in a few minutes here, but I think what is the
[1:21:29.720 --> 1:21:34.520]  point of us even talking about this because she'll be lionized now when they come out and demonize
[1:21:34.520 --> 1:21:41.160]  her or the Democrats attack her when they call her a Christian cult member and all this people
[1:21:41.160 --> 1:21:45.480]  will rally around her when they try to stop her. And I do want to see her vote to get Trump in
[1:21:45.480 --> 1:21:49.960]  so the Democrats are going to contest the election. What is the point of this? I guess just our integrity
[1:21:49.960 --> 1:21:55.080]  to just wow this is a really bad move by Trump and to hopefully have some type of political pressure
[1:21:55.080 --> 1:22:00.760]  on her to not become the second coming of Adolf Hitler? I think it becomes twofold. One is to
[1:22:00.760 --> 1:22:05.800]  try to get some Republican senators like Rand Paul to put her on blast on these issues to back
[1:22:05.800 --> 1:22:11.160]  down her commitment on these issues. But I think the bigger message is we need Trump elected now
[1:22:11.160 --> 1:22:16.760]  more than ever because the effect of Barrett being on the bench means that the only thing stopping
[1:22:16.760 --> 1:22:24.360]  forced vaccines, the only thing stopping another national lockdown, the only thing stopping these
[1:22:24.360 --> 1:22:29.880]  sort of George Soros, Koch family, big money elite agenda, Bill Gates agenda will be Donald
[1:22:29.880 --> 1:22:34.120]  Trump getting reelected. It means it's more important than ever because now that they have
[1:22:34.120 --> 1:22:39.080]  a control of the Supreme Court, Trump is the only thing stopping their agenda from becoming reality.
[1:22:39.080 --> 1:22:44.520]  Well that's my thinking exactly because I've studied Trump and I know he's not a perfect
[1:22:44.520 --> 1:22:48.760]  person but he means well this gets snuck in. I didn't even know until you told me two weeks ago.
[1:22:48.760 --> 1:22:54.440]  It's all true. I looked it up. His instincts are in the lockdown. His instincts are don't
[1:22:54.440 --> 1:22:59.800]  have to take the vaccine. His instincts are this is being exaggerated. This is a scam. And so
[1:22:59.800 --> 1:23:04.520]  exactly now more importantly than ever to get on down the road to get another better person to
[1:23:04.520 --> 1:23:08.680]  replace her because as you were saying if we got a good person we would have an override on the other
[1:23:08.680 --> 1:23:14.360]  side. Now they're gonna have an override for what they really want. Exactly. So like now that they
[1:23:14.360 --> 1:23:19.880]  have the court locked up there are the only protection at all is Trump. Trump's got to win
[1:23:19.880 --> 1:23:25.880]  and that means and only that people cannot bank on the election lawsuits going the right way
[1:23:25.880 --> 1:23:30.200]  because I don't trust her in that side of the equation either. She's backed by people who want
[1:23:30.200 --> 1:23:36.440]  Trump to lose. The main lawyer who led the various impeachment efforts, Norm Eisen, is out saying
[1:23:36.440 --> 1:23:41.160]  put her on the bench. So that means we can't trust the lawsuits and the courts to go the right way
[1:23:41.160 --> 1:23:45.080]  which means Trump needs to win by two, three points. He needs to win by a safe margin.
[1:23:45.080 --> 1:23:48.840]  So our Trump got really suckered bad on this. You're right. I mean Democrats,
[1:23:48.840 --> 1:23:52.760]  the real operatives are like hey let's have a show. Let's attack her but let's get her in.
[1:23:52.760 --> 1:23:55.080]  Do you think she's so controlled she might vote against Trump?
[1:23:55.960 --> 1:24:01.720]  Yes. Yes. Gee. I mean put it this way. Who comes out and says that they're like Justice Scalia
[1:24:01.720 --> 1:24:08.440]  before the nomination? Judge Thomas hid the fact that he was like Scalia. Judge Gorsuch hid the
[1:24:08.440 --> 1:24:12.360]  fact that he was like Scalia. The only kind of person who says they're going to be like Scalia
[1:24:12.360 --> 1:24:18.360]  before the nomination hearings is someone who's not and so that's why I think she's very untrustworthy
[1:24:18.360 --> 1:24:22.440]  and the people backing her, the Coke, I mean you look at what the Cokes are doing. They're
[1:24:22.440 --> 1:24:26.520]  spending a lot of money to see Trump beat while they're spending a lot of money to see Barrett
[1:24:26.520 --> 1:24:31.160]  on the bench. That's right. He came out a year ago. The Cokes are now fully against Trump
[1:24:31.160 --> 1:24:33.640]  but they're backing her. Wow. That's the strongest piece of evidence.
[1:24:34.760 --> 1:24:39.240]  Exactly. So that's why we, the public and the populist in the party and the populist in the
[1:24:39.240 --> 1:24:43.560]  country and the independents have to rally to Trump's defense because we, Trump needs to win
[1:24:43.560 --> 1:24:48.680]  by a bigger margin than ever because if he doesn't then hold on to your hat.
[1:24:48.680 --> 1:24:52.840]  Is there a silver lining just like we thought maybe Bill Barr was going to be bad to some of
[1:24:52.840 --> 1:24:58.440]  the background? Could Trump have co-opted her to be pro-America? I mean she's such a follower. Maybe
[1:24:58.440 --> 1:25:01.000]  she's going to get on the team. I mean is there a way to get that done?
[1:25:02.680 --> 1:25:07.080]  My fear is and it's what I told the people close to Trump that you know this is just like
[1:25:07.080 --> 1:25:13.880]  Comey and McCabe and Ray and Sessions and Rosenstein and Mattis and Coates and Tillerson that there
[1:25:13.880 --> 1:25:18.920]  were all bad judgments that people like us were warning Trump about and Trump didn't heed the
[1:25:18.920 --> 1:25:24.200]  warning. I agree. So Bill Barr is the exception not even completely of all the bad decisions.
[1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:29.560]  Okay. One guy didn't turn out to be a total piece of filth. Right. Exactly. Exactly. I mean I think
[1:25:29.560 --> 1:25:34.840]  and Barr what is is he's an institutionalist but he's like Kissinger. He recognizes the system is
[1:25:34.840 --> 1:25:39.000]  going to burn itself down. Real politics. He realizes that the left's so out of control and
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:43.240]  that the deep state's so out of control it needs to be curtailed. Exactly. The deep state is
[1:25:43.240 --> 1:25:47.880]  exposing itself the way it did in the late 60s early 70s and he realizes that if he doesn't
[1:25:47.880 --> 1:25:52.440]  hem them in they'll torch themselves and down deep he believes in the institution and when I was up
[1:25:52.440 --> 1:25:57.080]  and met him at the Hillsdale College event it was clear by what he said that he felt he didn't
[1:25:57.080 --> 1:26:03.240]  have control over Durham and repeat that what Bill Barr said is diametrically opposed to Amy
[1:26:03.240 --> 1:26:08.680]  Coney Barrett word for word. He said this is as bad as slavery. This is the closest thing
[1:26:08.680 --> 1:26:13.800]  to slavery we've had since slavery. That's the opposite of her. Exactly. He said this was the
[1:26:13.800 --> 1:26:19.560]  worst civil rights violation in American history since slavery. That's and I mean it was extraordinary
[1:26:19.560 --> 1:26:23.640]  state so he's telling people Barrett's a bad choice. He's telling people that he doesn't have
[1:26:23.640 --> 1:26:27.320]  control of Durham. He's telling people that the line prosecutors are ignoring what he does. That's
[1:26:27.320 --> 1:26:30.520]  right. He even came out earlier and said these prosecutors claim they'll do their job. They lie
[1:26:30.520 --> 1:26:35.400]  to my face. They don't. He's telling people. Exactly. And by the way I have a BS meter when
[1:26:35.400 --> 1:26:40.840]  he's saying oh this is real. I think the guy's genuinely pissed. Yes. Oh it was clear. It was
[1:26:40.840 --> 1:26:44.920]  very clear. He was even more aggressive in interpersonal communication off the video camera
[1:26:44.920 --> 1:26:49.960]  than he was when he was on tape. So it was clear he was extremely frustrated that he can't get
[1:26:49.960 --> 1:26:55.320]  anybody to go. The opposition is stronger and more corrupt than he thought. Exactly. And that's
[1:26:55.320 --> 1:27:00.600]  the problem he has. Why is the left and their minions so committed to destroying the country
[1:27:00.600 --> 1:27:05.160]  and just evil. They'd have more power if they were for the U.S. and I think that's where Barrett is.
[1:27:05.160 --> 1:27:10.040]  It's like why are you going to overthrow all this you idiots. It's arrogance. It's sort of like
[1:27:10.040 --> 1:27:13.560]  the deep state in the late 60s when they thought they could just start whacking presidents and
[1:27:13.560 --> 1:27:17.480]  whacking presidential candidates and whacking civil rights leaders and whacking people all
[1:27:17.480 --> 1:27:22.360]  around the world. They got so used to assassinating people overseas. They thought they could start
[1:27:22.360 --> 1:27:25.960]  doing it back home. They got so used to spying on movements overseas. They thought they could
[1:27:25.960 --> 1:27:31.880]  do it back home. Why would you want to put an invalid in with a cartoon lady for the chai comms
[1:27:31.880 --> 1:27:36.760]  when it when it when it hurts America and even their interest. They've just been born and bred
[1:27:36.760 --> 1:27:42.680]  to hate America. They think if they can beat America they somehow get better even though in
[1:27:42.680 --> 1:27:48.120]  real terms they get weaker. It's a spiritual thing isn't it Barnes. Oh no doubt about it. They're
[1:27:48.120 --> 1:27:52.120]  very disconnected to the spiritual heart and spiritual soul of America. They believe in power
[1:27:52.120 --> 1:27:56.520]  for its own sake and they've been so pampered and privileged. They're more like the French royalty
[1:27:56.520 --> 1:28:01.960]  of the 1700s than they are our American founders and you're seeing that. That's their real weakness
[1:28:01.960 --> 1:28:05.480]  in a way it's their strength because they're so dumb and bold but isn't that their weakness that
[1:28:05.480 --> 1:28:13.720]  they're totally dislike. Take like Trump's you know former ambassador to Germany and he's now
[1:28:13.720 --> 1:28:17.960]  the big national security head saying the media you idiots don't get everybody hates you. You're
[1:28:17.960 --> 1:28:22.680]  done. You're old. You're gone. Oh no doubt about it. I mean it's very much I mean the reason why
[1:28:22.680 --> 1:28:26.520]  the French Revolution succeeded is because French royalty was so out of touch. The reason why the
[1:28:26.520 --> 1:28:30.520]  American Revolution succeeded is because the British imperialists were so out of touch. The
[1:28:30.520 --> 1:28:34.520]  reason why many civil rights were the reason why Trump bulldozed everybody is because the elites
[1:28:34.520 --> 1:28:39.080]  are so out of touch. But the downside of that is that they have entrenched power and don't recognize
[1:28:39.080 --> 1:28:45.080]  how to even protect themselves in the process of burning America down. They are likely to burn
[1:28:45.080 --> 1:28:49.880]  down the village in the name of saving it unless we save it ourselves. That's right. I mean even
[1:28:49.880 --> 1:28:53.640]  the Hill has the right headline and so does so much others. It's like the Democrats do election
[1:28:53.640 --> 1:29:04.360]  plan a civil war. It's the evening of September 26 2020 and I just got done watching the horrible
[1:29:04.360 --> 1:29:11.640]  footage of thousands of riot police with trudgeons beating thousands of peaceful people
[1:29:11.640 --> 1:29:19.720]  in Trafalgar Square protesting the COVID martial law lockdown. An iron curtain is descending over
[1:29:19.720 --> 1:29:25.800]  the world from the United Nations even more evil than the old Soviet Union. And this model is
[1:29:25.800 --> 1:29:34.680]  communist China. We're not facing incremental tyranny. We're facing absolute 100% commitment to
[1:29:34.680 --> 1:29:38.920]  evil because the system thinks we're weak and thinks we're stupid and it's making us move.
[1:29:38.920 --> 1:29:43.000]  And whether it's Australia, the UK or the US, Black Lives Matter funded by Soros can run around and
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:47.640]  kill cops and burn things down in their heroes. And oh, nobody's worried about the COVID BS,
[1:29:47.640 --> 1:29:51.960]  but when it's patriots saying we have rights, we have dignity, they get viciously attacked.
[1:29:51.960 --> 1:29:57.960]  All of the videos are at infowars.com of David Ike speaking in more. We've now entered month
[1:29:57.960 --> 1:30:02.360]  number eight of the global lockdown and it's horrible and it's killing millions of people via
[1:30:02.360 --> 1:30:09.080]  starvation. But the good news is it's caused a planetary awakening as well. The general public
[1:30:09.080 --> 1:30:15.560]  all over the planet hate Bill Gates. He's the most unpopular person on earth. People know he's not
[1:30:15.560 --> 1:30:21.400]  a doctor. People know he's a eugenicist. The population knows that his vaccines that he pushes
[1:30:21.400 --> 1:30:26.600]  have been filled with cancer viruses, polio, sterilants and more. It's even in the associated
[1:30:26.600 --> 1:30:33.160]  press. So now they're beginning to understand that we the people know that there is a corporate
[1:30:33.160 --> 1:30:38.920]  global government and that these top tech billionaires sit in meetings and decide to pull the type of
[1:30:38.920 --> 1:30:44.840]  race war scams and coronavirus scams that we're witnessing. So remember that and let them know
[1:30:44.840 --> 1:30:50.520]  that we know who they are and what they've done and we hold them responsible for the collapse of
[1:30:50.520 --> 1:30:58.280]  civilization. They are the enemies of humanity. They want you dead. It was in the telecommunications
[1:30:58.280 --> 1:31:05.320]  act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS location. I read from the federal law
[1:31:05.320 --> 1:31:11.000]  and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American. Now the media admits that almost
[1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:16.520]  every app and every company that are on Apple and Androids don't just track your location
[1:31:16.520 --> 1:31:22.600]  but your surfing history. Where you go, who you talk to, your relationships and they all
[1:31:22.600 --> 1:31:27.720]  share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well including having apps turn
[1:31:27.720 --> 1:31:33.960]  on and listen to what you're saying just like Siri or Alexa do and then putting databases,
[1:31:33.960 --> 1:31:39.000]  transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever. Your phone is
[1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:43.720]  spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on information.
[1:31:43.720 --> 1:31:49.160]  This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score. Get your protection privacy pockets at

[1:32:15.160 --> 1:32:22.440]  Also the media is going to call me a genius when the second wave I've been warning of comes in the
[1:32:22.440 --> 1:32:28.920]  fall and winter because we're gonna count all the flu and all the pneumonia and cold death of old
[1:32:28.920 --> 1:32:37.000]  people again and the lockdown will never end. That's why we're saying the vaccine will take several
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:44.280]  years but don't worry it'll come out. I'll make a bunch of money you'll get sick but that's okay
[1:32:44.280 --> 1:32:51.240]  because I ran the Wuhan lab and it's all public but I don't get in trouble. If you talk bad about
[1:32:51.240 --> 1:32:54.280]  me we use big tech to shut you up.
[1:32:54.280 --> 1:33:10.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:25.080 --> 1:33:32.280]  I've got my ass together gonna want the whole load. You've been back in my bullets. Alex Jones
[1:33:32.280 --> 1:33:40.360]  here live. Brother Barnes our guest on this Sunday night. People aren't listening to you. Rick
[1:33:40.360 --> 1:33:46.600]  Grinnell rips into the press of their clown show Annex at the White House briefing and again this
[1:33:46.600 --> 1:33:53.560]  is the director of natural intelligence. He was the ambassador to Germany. Got a lot of concessions
[1:33:53.560 --> 1:33:57.800]  from NATO and he just well I mean here's what he had to say because we're reaching that point
[1:33:57.800 --> 1:34:00.840]  but the press even though they're being booed everywhere they go haven't figured it out yet.
[1:34:00.840 --> 1:34:07.400]  Here it is. The special envoy to these talks between Serbia and Kosovo but I wanted to ask
[1:34:07.400 --> 1:34:11.800]  you about another initiative you led. Last year you kicked off the Trump administration push to
[1:34:11.800 --> 1:34:18.760]  decriminalize homes. I don't know if you can find it on a map but this is atrocious. I have to tell
[1:34:18.760 --> 1:34:24.520]  you guys you might be too young to understand what this issue is about. Maybe the older journalists
[1:34:24.520 --> 1:34:32.040]  should step up and say this is a big deal. This is a big issue. I'm astounded what happens in
[1:34:32.040 --> 1:34:37.640]  Washington DC and especially in this room. I got to tell you get substantive. Maybe it's too
[1:34:37.640 --> 1:34:43.800]  complicated of an issue for you all. So they're really jokes. We have a major piece still he's
[1:34:43.800 --> 1:34:49.080]  been nominated for the Nobel Prize for. This is a big deal. Millions of debt overall and they're
[1:34:49.080 --> 1:34:53.880]  just going to bring up some distractionary BS at every event at every level of government.
[1:34:53.880 --> 1:34:57.160]  They call a press conference on an issue. They won't even ask one real question.
[1:34:58.520 --> 1:35:00.840]  They're a joke. Don't they get there out of bullets.
[1:35:02.600 --> 1:35:07.560]  Not the media. The media class is young. It's heavily millennial and now even Zoomer
[1:35:07.560 --> 1:35:11.320]  and they're totally disconnected from ordinary people. They've grown up in upper middle class
[1:35:11.320 --> 1:35:17.080]  bubbles. They think Seinfeld is a as a documentary. So I mean they don't understand sort of ordinary
[1:35:17.080 --> 1:35:22.600]  everyday Americans in middle America. And that disassociation and disconnection continues to
[1:35:22.600 --> 1:35:27.960]  assist and enable Trump to move forward. And so the I think that that media gap will be in a gap
[1:35:27.960 --> 1:35:32.840]  that Trump can still utilize. But increasingly what what the Barrett choice means is that
[1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:36.760]  we got to have President Trump in and it means some of the people that are pretending to be
[1:35:36.760 --> 1:35:43.560]  his allies are really his adversaries. It came out today according to Maria on Fox that in fact
[1:35:43.560 --> 1:35:48.600]  there's going to be no indictments and no report from Durham. So that means that they're further
[1:35:48.600 --> 1:35:52.680]  isolating and not helping Trump at key positions that had been and that's why they come out that
[1:35:52.680 --> 1:35:58.280]  Mueller team joked about wiping phones and openly said they were total complete criminal arrogance.
[1:35:59.320 --> 1:36:03.400]  Exactly. In a civil case they're allowing Discovery to move forward to hurt Trump
[1:36:03.400 --> 1:36:07.880]  in the McCabe lawsuit against the FBI, the stroke lawsuit against the FBI,
[1:36:07.880 --> 1:36:13.240]  in the the Lisa Page lawsuit in the New York Times with the tax records. I mean of course in
[1:36:13.240 --> 1:36:16.680]  real estate he did it where he got losses most of the year. That's how you run real estate where
[1:36:16.680 --> 1:36:22.520]  you go bankrupt. That is a criminal violation by the way for everybody watching IRS section
[1:36:22.520 --> 1:36:28.920]  6103 of title 26 makes it a crime makes it illegal to leak those tax returns. And here they leak
[1:36:28.920 --> 1:36:32.520]  them right on the eve of the election. It had to have come from Congress or someone other than the
[1:36:32.520 --> 1:36:37.400]  IRS or the New York Attorney General's office or the DA's office who's also been trying to get these
[1:36:37.400 --> 1:36:42.440]  records. So somebody or the Mueller team somebody leaked these records illegally it's a crime there
[1:36:42.440 --> 1:36:47.000]  should be investigations but that's what happens when nobody sees any consequences from the Durham
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:52.440]  inquiry. And to Barr's credit he hinted at this at the Hillsdale meeting that I was at the dinner
[1:36:52.440 --> 1:36:58.280]  with him is that he had no control over the people underneath him that he's trying. He said these
[1:36:58.280 --> 1:37:03.880]  people literally just work for the deep state do whatever they want. Exactly that there's no longer
[1:37:03.880 --> 1:37:08.360]  Democratic controls little D Democratic controls. I think you said it Trump makes mistakes he gets
[1:37:08.360 --> 1:37:15.160]  educated. I think we educate him and warn him on this lady so that we he gets concessions and behind
[1:37:15.160 --> 1:37:20.120]  the scenes upfront she gets hit with some real questions by Republicans instead of fawning at
[1:37:20.120 --> 1:37:25.080]  her so we can get her position to not be a total traitor because I think I think she's a follower
[1:37:25.080 --> 1:37:30.840]  bear it is and I think overall she has some good ideas some really bad ideas. I think just her MO
[1:37:30.840 --> 1:37:33.960]  now that I've had a chance to look at her maybe I'm wrong is that if there's enough pressure put on
[1:37:33.960 --> 1:37:39.160]  her at the hearings and by the culture that she won't be the creature of the Koch brothers and the
[1:37:39.160 --> 1:37:44.680]  Trump can cut her out or is that just no hope. Oh no there's hope of that because she's a memorizer
[1:37:44.680 --> 1:37:50.040]  personality she's not like a Bork level intellect. So the she's one of those people that memorized
[1:37:50.040 --> 1:37:54.760]  everything in school and was kind of the teacher's pet kind of personality. So that was also another
[1:37:54.760 --> 1:38:00.200]  kind of authoritarian. Oh yes a story about Bork had a lot of crazy ideas he was for forced
[1:38:00.200 --> 1:38:06.280]  sterilization as a condition of employment so I was never a Bork fan but he was extremely
[1:38:06.280 --> 1:38:12.840]  intelligent whereas so that meant he was harder to move. She's not very intelligent actually at all
[1:38:13.720 --> 1:38:20.200]  and so she is someone that can through pressure be pushed about to change positions and so that's
[1:38:20.200 --> 1:38:25.480]  the one but in the second component is everybody needs to rally to Trump and third Trump needs
[1:38:25.480 --> 1:38:29.880]  better political people around them than the election stretch. Like for example he should be
[1:38:29.880 --> 1:38:36.360]  having advertising about how his he has kept us out of war in the Midwest. Exactly no ads about
[1:38:36.360 --> 1:38:41.880]  how the biggest peace deals in like a hundred years nothing about all the real accomplishments I
[1:38:41.880 --> 1:38:46.840]  agree. Exactly yeah they're running like he's running like a chamber of commerce republican
[1:38:46.840 --> 1:38:51.160]  or a Romney republican with his ads that's not the way to win in Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin
[1:38:51.160 --> 1:38:56.920]  I agree he needs to say it's the deep state kill the economy they're bad people know the deep
[1:38:56.920 --> 1:39:00.760]  state did it they want to hear Trump say what they already know. Trump needs to say what we
[1:39:00.760 --> 1:39:05.560]  already know he says that he wins he says stuff people don't care about they don't come out and vote.
[1:39:06.600 --> 1:39:10.360]  Exactly he needs to say look the choice is a simple and he's to hammer this in the debates
[1:39:10.360 --> 1:39:14.840]  if you want more war vote for Joe Biden if you want more bad if you want to like he said at his
[1:39:14.840 --> 1:39:19.800]  at his speech at his renomination speech he said look if you want you know what Joe Biden did is
[1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:25.080]  he shipped your your jobs overseas and then he shipped your kids to die overseas he needs to
[1:39:25.080 --> 1:39:29.640]  hammer that in the debate on Tuesday and then he needs to hammer that in the television advertisements
[1:39:29.640 --> 1:39:34.360]  after that it needs to remind him that this election is if you want more lockdowns especially
[1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:38.440]  given Barrett's gonna be on the court if you want more lockdowns vote for Joe Biden the only thing
[1:39:38.440 --> 1:39:42.440]  stopping it is Donald Trump the only thing protecting your job and protecting your safety
[1:39:42.440 --> 1:39:47.560]  and protecting your security and keeping us out of bad war is Donald Trump he is your last line of
[1:39:47.560 --> 1:39:54.520]  defense he is your wall literally and figuratively between total disaster and American re-hope and
[1:39:54.520 --> 1:39:59.320]  re-opportunity. I love watching these videos of some of the peace deals the White House how
[1:39:59.880 --> 1:40:04.120]  all of the establishment anybody that's actually powerful doesn't wear a mask everyone else does
[1:40:04.120 --> 1:40:09.480]  this is a real class thing the three minutes we've got left Barnes the martial law in England
[1:40:09.480 --> 1:40:13.320]  arresting people to come out and protest the lockdowns the second wave because they know
[1:40:13.320 --> 1:40:17.320]  there's always flu and cold deaths during the winter they're hyping I mean we need Trump to go on
[1:40:17.320 --> 1:40:21.800]  offense against COVID as a fraud I mean I think that's one of his big failings yeah he's having
[1:40:21.800 --> 1:40:26.040]  rallies yeah he makes fun of the mask but he I think he needs to go further and really kill their
[1:40:26.040 --> 1:40:31.720]  key issue the deep states using to kill the economy. Exactly make the lockdown in the Midwest the
[1:40:31.720 --> 1:40:35.880]  issue of the election say look if you do you want more lockdowns do you want the end of your jobs
[1:40:35.880 --> 1:40:40.440]  permanently you mean make the in the Midwest make the election about three things do you want more
[1:40:40.440 --> 1:40:45.560]  lockdowns do you want more war or do you want more more jobs you want them shipped off because
[1:40:45.560 --> 1:40:50.120]  Joe Biden is horrible on all three he's a guarantee for more lockdown. He wants your guns and he wants
[1:40:50.120 --> 1:40:55.560]  to open the borders and he supports pedophiles. Exactly you have all of those additional components
[1:40:55.560 --> 1:41:00.200]  but hammer those three issues where Trump is uniquely strong much stronger than your average
[1:41:00.200 --> 1:41:05.480]  Republican and Biden is uniquely weak even weaker than Hillary Clinton on those issues. I agree and I
[1:41:05.480 --> 1:41:09.640]  think he's smart to put out the habit you know Joe's getting a methamphetamine shot all the rest of it
[1:41:09.640 --> 1:41:15.240]  join us Tuesday night if you want to we're gonna just stay live from 8 a.m. with David Knight right
[1:41:15.240 --> 1:41:19.480]  through to midnight we're gonna six to seven no break I'm gonna be there whole time John Lorraine
[1:41:19.480 --> 1:41:24.040]  you own shroyer whoever else wants to be here Savannah Hernandez we're gonna have crew on the
[1:41:24.040 --> 1:41:29.720]  ground in Cleveland covering all of it this debate is going to be spectacular what do you
[1:41:29.720 --> 1:41:34.440]  think's gonna happen it's critical I think Biden will come across much better than people think
[1:41:34.440 --> 1:41:38.600]  Trump is right that he's like they're gonna be drugged up but I think he'll come across like
[1:41:38.600 --> 1:41:41.800]  in that debate with Bernie went on one where everybody thought he'd fall apart he actually
[1:41:41.800 --> 1:41:45.960]  did the best he's ever done so I think they're gonna have him tuned up they've been having him
[1:41:45.960 --> 1:41:50.440]  sort of isolated for a week just preparing him for the debate they that he'll be on robot mode
[1:41:50.440 --> 1:41:55.000]  he'll be on rep you know repetition mode so I think he'll come across better than expected
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:42:00.040]  the key is for Trump to hammer the big issues remind people that Joe Biden has voted for every bad
[1:42:00.040 --> 1:42:04.520]  war in history remind people that Joe Biden has voted for every bad trade deal in history
[1:42:04.520 --> 1:42:09.000]  remind people that if Joe Biden is elected you're gonna be locked down the moment he gets in the
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:15.640]  inaugurated so hammer black people she has the lowest polls of any candidate and the whole
[1:42:15.640 --> 1:42:21.400]  dnc system not even 2% everybody I know that's black literally hates her she's so fake she thinks
[1:42:21.400 --> 1:42:28.440]  Tupac is still alive and they recognize her right away I mean they recognize who she is they recognize
[1:42:28.440 --> 1:42:32.440]  where she comes from that she comes from the Jamaican slaveholding aristocracy that she's more
[1:42:32.440 --> 1:42:36.760]  Indian and Canadian than she is African American her mother was Indian she grew up in Canada they
[1:42:36.760 --> 1:42:43.000]  know and she's someone who is a harsh punitive vicious often selective prosecutor she kept innocent
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:47.400]  people in jail deliberately knowing they were innocent that's right so all right Robert Barnes
[1:42:47.400 --> 1:42:51.240]  amazing thank you so much people can follow him on twitter Robert Barnes thank you so much final
[1:42:51.240 --> 1:42:59.960]  segment with David Ike straight ahead are you sick and tired of your calm peaceful life are you
[1:42:59.960 --> 1:43:09.480]  sleeping too well at night is your city too safe well not anymore introducing democrats
[1:43:09.480 --> 1:43:16.280]  politicians so incompetent they'll fill your neighborhood with riots looting rampant violence
[1:43:16.280 --> 1:43:22.680]  and even homelessness the secret is a special blend of corruption and good old-fashioned stupidity
[1:43:23.480 --> 1:43:31.080]  no more pesky law and order when democrats are in charge nobody's safe simply vote for democrats
[1:43:31.080 --> 1:43:37.160]  sit back and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground but wait vote for democrats now
[1:43:37.160 --> 1:43:44.040]  and they'll include rolling blackouts election fraud cancel culture taxes and more taxes
[1:43:44.040 --> 1:43:47.800]  democrats bringing chaos right to your front door
[1:43:55.880 --> 1:44:00.360]  i've come to you many times and ask for your support and you've always come through
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:06.120]  and info wars has come through we've never sold out we've never backed down we've always told the
[1:44:06.120 --> 1:44:13.320]  truth we've made mistakes but 98 percent of the time or so we're dead on and the enemy knows that
[1:44:13.320 --> 1:44:18.040]  info wars is a thought leader not just here but around the world and that's why the chai
[1:44:18.040 --> 1:44:24.280]  comms hollywood the globalist won us off the air because their global plan of total tyranny
[1:44:24.280 --> 1:44:29.560]  and a post-human world will not succeed if we stay on air if you don't support us ladies and gentlemen
[1:44:29.560 --> 1:44:34.760]  now they're going to shut info wars down and shut everybody else down as well you already know that
[1:44:34.760 --> 1:44:41.480]  it's out the open so again count the cost focus and realize how critical you are with your word
[1:44:41.480 --> 1:44:45.080]  of mouth spreading the word that overrides the sensors your financial support getting the products
[1:44:45.080 --> 1:44:50.680]  at infowarstore.com and your prayer i'm praying for you please pray for us let's do this together
[1:44:50.680 --> 1:44:54.680]  we're gonna win we are winning but it's not gonna be easy the enemy's trying to take it all from us
[1:44:54.680 --> 1:45:01.160]  let's not let them succeed the renaissance the great enlightenment it's all being swept away
[1:45:01.160 --> 1:45:11.400]  and being replaced by scientific tyranny that's establishing a form of planetary digital law where
[1:45:11.400 --> 1:45:18.200]  the technocrats are above the law the public isn't even considered to be as valuable as a count
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:25.160]  that humans are seen as garbage it's going to be taken out and removed that is the post-human
[1:45:25.160 --> 1:45:31.400]  exterminist plan that is the public ideology of the globalists and everything they've built with
[1:45:31.400 --> 1:45:40.200]  this high-tech grid is to absorb us and anesthetize our minds as we're slowly killed and any future
[1:45:40.200 --> 1:45:45.720]  generations that happen to straggle out of their mother's wounds will be a mere shadow of what
[1:45:45.720 --> 1:45:53.800]  humans once were this is the satanic ruling elite engaged in mass vandalism against god's creation
[1:45:53.800 --> 1:46:00.280]  humanity this is the essence of evil servants of fate are working around the clock to silence
[1:46:00.840 --> 1:46:05.240]  the people of not just the united states but of the world because there is a great awakening
[1:46:05.240 --> 1:46:10.520]  taking place everyone i talk to everywhere i go people that weren't even religious or spiritual
[1:46:11.080 --> 1:46:16.520]  now understand this fight between good and evil and they're finding christ and they're finding the
[1:46:16.520 --> 1:46:23.000]  prophecies that aren't like nostradamus they but are very very detailed and extremely specific
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:29.560]  that are now coming true at a frightening rate frightening because so many people are still
[1:46:29.560 --> 1:46:36.520]  living under the control of the god of this world satan did not realize that their immortal souls
[1:46:36.520 --> 1:46:43.800]  are in grave danger do not fear he who can kill the body fear he who can kill the soul as the

[1:50:45.560 --> 1:50:50.680]  for the whole semester churches are closed but the topless bars and liquor stores are open
[1:50:50.680 --> 1:50:56.040]  all the big scientific chiefs advising force vaccines uh owned part of the vaccine companies
[1:50:56.040 --> 1:51:00.840]  the government says that's fine both the us and the uk are resting people not wearing masks but
[1:51:00.840 --> 1:51:05.240]  non-arresting muslims that carry out attacks trump's ignoring it all which is good governor
[1:51:05.240 --> 1:51:10.040]  santus is saying it's all a giant fraud but here's david eye who's on with us live tomorrow
[1:51:10.680 --> 1:51:15.640]  part of his long speech that said band out video very very powerful they're censoring this so be
[1:51:15.640 --> 1:51:19.960]  sure and share it here he is laying out what we're really facing what we're really dealing with
[1:51:19.960 --> 1:51:23.720]  we're going to end the transmission with this and then owens shroyer takes over on these same
[1:51:23.720 --> 1:51:28.360]  streams and the same radio and tv stations at band out video and full wars dot com for its last
[1:51:28.360 --> 1:51:33.240]  show so remember paul reveres you are what amplifies everything when you take action we win when you
[1:51:33.240 --> 1:51:57.320]  don't we lose here's david like to think that people used to laugh at me in the street once
[1:51:57.320 --> 1:52:05.400]  we speak your truth and the world comes to you humanity
[1:52:05.400 --> 1:52:29.880]  we face a big big challenge and it will require enormous courage unquenchable determination
[1:52:29.880 --> 1:52:38.360]  and fortitude but we will not crumble we will not fail
[1:52:43.080 --> 1:52:57.240]  people human family across the world awaken to who you really are remember remember who you
[1:52:57.240 --> 1:53:06.600]  really are and it's not what they have been telling you and what the human family has done
[1:53:07.640 --> 1:53:20.360]  is allow the psychopaths to hijack our imagination of ourselves and we need to take it back
[1:53:20.360 --> 1:53:36.120]  the psychopaths have kept from us a sparkling sparkling truth which opens all doors and all
[1:53:36.120 --> 1:53:48.360]  gateways that this world is but a dream and the dream is the dreamer and the dreamer is the dream
[1:53:48.360 --> 1:53:58.920]  they are indivisible what we believe we perceive and what we perceive we experience
[1:53:59.880 --> 1:54:06.760]  and it's time to take our minds back from the psychopaths take our perceptions
[1:54:06.760 --> 1:54:25.720]  back from them and to dream another dream a dream in which the few controlling the many plays no
[1:54:25.720 --> 1:54:39.160]  part bill hicks used to finish his shows like this the world is like a ride in an amusement park
[1:54:40.040 --> 1:54:44.920]  and when you go on it you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are
[1:54:46.040 --> 1:54:53.880]  the ride goes up and down round and round it has drills and chills and it's very brightly colored
[1:54:53.880 --> 1:55:00.600]  and it's very loud and it's fun for a while some have been on the ride for a long time
[1:55:00.600 --> 1:55:08.280]  and they begin to question is this real or is this just a ride and others have come back to us
[1:55:08.280 --> 1:55:15.240]  and they say hey don't be afraid ever because this is just a ride and we kill those people
[1:55:16.200 --> 1:55:22.040]  shut him up i've got a lot invested in this ride shut him up look at my furrows of worry
[1:55:22.040 --> 1:55:30.440]  and my big bank account and my family this has to be real it's just a ride but we always kill
[1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:37.080]  those good guys that try to tell us that and let the demons run amok but it doesn't matter
[1:55:37.080 --> 1:55:45.080]  because it's just a ride and we can change it anytime we want no job no savings of money
[1:55:45.080 --> 1:55:52.600]  no money just a choice right now between fear and love
[1:55:57.800 --> 1:56:12.040]  and that is all it is all it has ever been fear the currency of control says i freeze
[1:56:12.040 --> 1:56:22.200]  i obey i submit love says i am free
[1:56:29.880 --> 1:56:34.200]  love says prize freedom
[1:56:34.200 --> 1:56:56.520]  and what love brings is a backbone of steel and the power of no no i will not cooperate
[1:56:56.520 --> 1:57:05.720]  with our own enslavement and there are billions of ours and a handful of you when we wake up to
[1:57:05.720 --> 1:57:21.400]  that the game is over who are we little me no no no we are the power in everyone we are the dance
[1:57:21.400 --> 1:57:34.200]  of the moon and the sun we are the truth that will never hide we are the turning of the tide
[1:57:34.200 --> 1:57:51.000]  thank you very much
