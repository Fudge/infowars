[00:00.000 --> 00:11.840]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:11.840 --> 00:18.840]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:18.840 --> 00:25.640]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:25.640 --> 00:29.720]  And now we come to you live from the Info Wars News Center, deep in the heart of Texas
[00:29.720 --> 00:33.560]  now under FEMA Region 6 occupation.
[00:33.560 --> 00:37.120]  World government is openly being announced, nations across the planet are struggling
[00:37.120 --> 00:40.160]  from Australia to the U.K., to the U.S. to get out of it.
[00:40.160 --> 00:46.000]  We have a bunch of key gas to Intel today, the 2016 campaign is on fire, Trump is coming
[00:46.000 --> 00:50.760]  out against Crooked Hillary like never before, she is in political hot water.
[00:50.760 --> 00:56.000]  We've got Obama stumbling around, can't even find words to go after Trump.
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.000]  The enemy is off balance, I'm telling you.
[00:58.000 --> 01:03.160]  It's a spiritual tipping point moment, first a John Bowne report that is key.
[01:03.160 --> 01:09.080]  So many people around the world lack this freedom, we should never take that for granted.
[01:09.080 --> 01:15.120]  The FBI will soon be legally reading anyone's emails without the disintegrating protection
[01:15.120 --> 01:18.760]  of the Fourth Amendment or the issuance of a warrant.
[01:18.760 --> 01:23.480]  Just for the record, the Fourth Amendment states, the right of the people to be secure
[01:23.480 --> 01:29.680]  in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures
[01:29.680 --> 01:36.640]  shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by
[01:36.640 --> 01:42.960]  oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or
[01:42.960 --> 01:45.440]  things to be seized.
[01:45.440 --> 01:51.120]  As it stands, in order for your emails to be searched, currently a FISA court order deemed
[01:51.120 --> 01:55.600]  essential to the protection of national security has to be authorized.
[01:55.600 --> 02:01.040]  However, the FBI can plunder your phone records with a national security letter, but after
[02:01.040 --> 02:06.160]  years of whittling down the Fourth Amendment in the name of the CIA-backed and globalist
[02:06.160 --> 02:11.680]  engineered war on terror, the Fourth Amendment will soon be DOA.
[02:11.680 --> 02:18.240]  Zero Hedge reports, the 2017 Intelligence Authorization Bill is used to fund the intelligence
[02:18.240 --> 02:23.520]  community, set policy and authorize resources for intelligence purposes.
[02:23.520 --> 02:29.720]  The 2017 Intelligence Authorization Bill grants the FBI the authority to obtain Americans
[02:29.720 --> 02:36.240]  email using only a national security letter, meaning it will now be able to access email
[02:36.240 --> 02:38.440]  without a court order.
[02:38.440 --> 02:44.240]  In 2010, the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed an amicus brief attached to a civil
[02:44.240 --> 02:48.360]  criminal suit in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.
[02:48.360 --> 02:53.720]  The appeals court ruled in the U.S. vs. Warshack case that the government must have a search
[02:53.720 --> 03:00.680]  warrant before it can secretly seize and search emails stored by email service providers.
[03:00.680 --> 03:06.160]  Closely tracking arguments made by the EFF in its amicus brief, the court found that
[03:06.160 --> 03:12.720]  email users have the same reasonable expectation of privacy in their stored email as they do
[03:12.720 --> 03:15.640]  in their phone calls and postal mail.
[03:15.640 --> 03:20.320]  On Tuesday, May 24, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said,
[03:20.320 --> 03:24.840]  This bill takes a hatchet to important protections for Americans' liberty.
[03:24.840 --> 03:31.680]  This bill would mean more government surveillance of Americans, less due process and less independent
[03:31.680 --> 03:34.560]  oversight of U.S. intelligence agencies.
[03:34.560 --> 03:39.120]  Worse, neither of the intelligence agencies nor of the bill's sponsors have shown any
[03:39.120 --> 03:45.120]  evidence that these changes would do anything to make Americans more secure.
[03:45.120 --> 03:49.960]  But the suck-ups inhabiting our nation's capital have other ideas.
[03:49.960 --> 03:53.760]  But because we all rolled up our sleeves and worked together, the bill before us today
[03:53.760 --> 03:57.400]  is an exceptional work product and I'm very proud to support it.
[03:57.400 --> 04:02.040]  The IAA also addresses key strategic questions that we have been asking over the course of
[04:02.040 --> 04:03.040]  the year.
[04:03.040 --> 04:07.840]  First, are we focusing too much on the threats of the day at the expense of the threats of
[04:07.840 --> 04:08.840]  tomorrow?
[04:08.840 --> 04:12.680]  I'd also like to thank the staff on both sides for their hard work on this year's Intelligence
[04:12.680 --> 04:14.920]  Authorization Act or the IAA.
[04:14.920 --> 04:19.040]  I also appreciate the opportunity to stand here in support of this year's bipartisan
[04:19.040 --> 04:20.440]  IAA.
[04:20.440 --> 04:24.840]  We ask a lot of our intelligence community when it comes to collaboration.
[04:24.840 --> 04:27.640]  When they collaborate, they best keep us safe.
[04:27.640 --> 04:31.320]  And what we have done today is we are sending to the floor a bill that reflects our own
[04:31.320 --> 04:35.800]  collaboration and shows that what we expect of them, we can also deliver to the House
[04:35.800 --> 04:36.800]  floor.
[04:36.800 --> 04:41.960]  The 2017 is shaping up to be the year Big Brother begins secretly hauling in the enemies
[04:41.960 --> 04:48.880]  of the emerging totalitarian state based on their private and once-protected correspondences.
[04:48.880 --> 04:55.560]  Just another federal alphabet agency given, yet again, powers that don't exist under the
[04:55.560 --> 04:58.560]  American Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[04:58.560 --> 05:05.040]  John Baum for InfoWorks.com Ladies and gentlemen, Teleprompter and Chief, I'm edited.
[05:05.040 --> 05:17.400]  If we turn against each other based on divisions of race or religion, if we fall for, you know,
[05:17.400 --> 05:32.040]  a bunch of okey-doke just because, you know, it sounds funnier.
[05:32.040 --> 05:41.720]  Well, he's trying to make Trump look bad, but he won't be debating Trump.
[05:41.720 --> 05:42.720]  Hillary will.
[05:42.720 --> 05:44.680]  Well, first of all, they're just words.
[05:44.680 --> 05:46.080]  She reads off a teleprompter.
[05:46.080 --> 05:47.920]  You notice she's reading off a teleprompter.
[05:47.920 --> 05:48.920]  She always does.
[05:48.920 --> 05:51.400]  She really doesn't have her own words.
[05:51.400 --> 05:53.720]  It should be fun.

[07:53.240 --> 08:19.720]  I'm Alex Jones for Supermail Vitality and InfoWarsLife.com and I salute you, our supporters.
[08:19.720 --> 08:37.080]  I'm Alex Jones here live broadcasting worldwide.
[08:37.080 --> 08:42.280]  We're here for the next four hours as we are every weekday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard
[08:42.280 --> 08:43.280]  Time.
[08:43.280 --> 08:48.280]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m. Eastern.
[08:48.280 --> 08:54.760]  I tend to say this all the time when I start the broadcast, but man is it true that global
[08:54.760 --> 09:00.400]  government is happening just like they said it would with engineered crises, collapsing
[09:00.400 --> 09:12.680]  borders, disintegrating family, dissolving rights, imploding prosperity, metastasizing
[09:12.680 --> 09:25.320]  mental illness, rampaging wickedness and evil with the world ruled by openly corrupt, slouching
[09:25.320 --> 09:36.920]  tyrants, drunk on the blood of the innocents.
[09:36.920 --> 09:42.160]  We have a planet with leadership that is asleep at the switch.
[09:42.160 --> 09:48.400]  They're busy stealing and robbing and engaging in every form of corruption you can imagine
[09:48.400 --> 09:53.560]  and they're busy trying to keep the public dumb down distracted so they can stay in control.
[09:53.560 --> 10:02.040]  They're not in control of themselves or the byproducts of this system they've established.
[10:02.040 --> 10:05.640]  It is incredible.
[10:05.640 --> 10:10.560]  Now I'm going to get the clip because he gives like two hour long speeches.
[10:10.560 --> 10:18.800]  When I was watching Fox News this morning while I was working out at about 9 o'clock,
[10:18.800 --> 10:24.280]  I worked out late today and I was about to finish up and they played a clip about a minute
[10:24.280 --> 10:26.320]  long of Trump.
[10:26.320 --> 10:33.280]  And if he has that attitude and if he has that spirit, he will dominate this election
[10:33.280 --> 10:41.560]  when for sure and it was the same spirit of where he points to the sleaze ABC reporter
[10:41.560 --> 10:50.520]  and he says, we've gotten the donations, we said we got, we've given them, here are the
[10:50.520 --> 10:55.600]  veterans groups and you're a sleaze for implying we haven't done it when you know we've done
[10:55.600 --> 11:03.160]  it and he's legitimately angry at these lying scum.
[11:03.160 --> 11:10.600]  Well today in the speech and we've got parts of the speech up on info wars dot com but
[11:10.600 --> 11:15.520]  it's not in those particular videos.
[11:15.520 --> 11:20.520]  He's talking about, she keeps lying about my foreign policy when you can go to my website
[11:20.520 --> 11:26.880]  and read my foreign policy or go see my speeches I've given and they send out to millions of
[11:26.880 --> 11:35.040]  citizens emails and the media puts out propaganda misrepresenting what I say and what I stand
[11:35.040 --> 11:42.520]  for these people are crooked, these people are out of control, these people are corrupt
[11:42.520 --> 11:48.800]  and these people have got to be defeated and it's not just calling her crooked or you know
[11:48.800 --> 11:59.120]  little Rubio or whatever little Marco or lion Ted, he needs to say these are organized crime
[11:59.120 --> 12:05.120]  scum that have hijacked the country that have sold our weapons to al-Qaeda and ISIS that
[12:05.120 --> 12:10.080]  have given our missile secrets to communist China and that are preying on the American
[12:10.080 --> 12:17.320]  people and put Obamacare in over America to shut this country's economic structure down
[12:17.320 --> 12:23.400]  completely and to bankrupt the nation while fleecing the people.
[12:23.400 --> 12:27.200]  I mean Trump needs to completely take the gloves off every time he does he goes up in
[12:27.200 --> 12:33.480]  the polls and I love what I see it's already hardcore compared to all these milk toast politicians
[12:33.480 --> 12:38.320]  and pundits and he's a shatter the illusion because here's the big secret of politics
[12:38.320 --> 12:43.160]  and there's many secrets but this is the biggest or maybe one of the top two or three you can
[12:43.160 --> 12:46.080]  debate it all day long.
[12:46.080 --> 12:52.740]  But the real zeitgeist of how we're being controlled is the control of the zeitgeist.
[12:52.740 --> 13:00.160]  They put out fake zeitgeist so that the average person in Europe or the United States or anywhere
[13:00.160 --> 13:06.400]  in the world for this matter sits there and reads the newspaper or surfs the internet
[13:06.400 --> 13:14.320]  or watches television and watches this ocean of political pundits that really don't disagree
[13:14.320 --> 13:20.320]  with each other because they're within a small area of the spectrum.
[13:20.320 --> 13:24.800]  They're loyalist republicans, they're loyalist democrats, they're loyalist Tories, they're
[13:24.800 --> 13:33.000]  loyalist labor, they're loyalist social democrats, they're loyalist German conservatives.
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.600]  At the end of the day the leadership are all basically meeting in smoky rooms because it's
[13:36.600 --> 13:41.240]  good for business, it's good to control things, it's good for the business of crony capitalism
[13:41.240 --> 13:48.360]  but not good for the people and they've got things pretty much sewn up, they think until
[13:48.360 --> 13:52.800]  there's a total paradigm shift and people get outside the box.
[13:52.800 --> 13:57.440]  So to quantify this it's very, very simple but also very, very complex at the same time
[13:57.440 --> 14:00.680]  and you don't hear this talked about in politics, you don't read this in books, this is just
[14:00.680 --> 14:06.920]  my observation and the fact that my observations over the years because they are from outside
[14:06.920 --> 14:14.560]  the box but from a historical perspective become many times the major talking points
[14:14.560 --> 14:19.160]  a week later, a month later, a year later, a decade later in the political culture.
[14:19.160 --> 14:28.560]  What I say, what I do, the ideas that I espouse are a cobbling together of other political
[14:28.560 --> 14:36.800]  ideas and systems and historical thoughts and philosophy but they are specifically a fresh
[14:36.800 --> 14:38.360]  look.
[14:38.360 --> 14:45.160]  Now that doesn't say that I've got all the answers or that boy I'm a big wheel, no it
[14:45.160 --> 14:53.640]  shows that their system is so fake and so based on keeping you within a fake synthetic debate
[14:53.640 --> 14:58.760]  where you never realize there's a whole world politically outside of that and it's there
[14:58.760 --> 15:02.840]  to prop up that idea of the facade and everybody's probably nodding their head going yeah tell
[15:02.840 --> 15:07.800]  us something we don't know, see you inherently already know that, I know that, I'm just on
[15:07.800 --> 15:14.160]  the air shaying things that are common sense but in a world of universal deceit to quote
[15:14.160 --> 15:26.200]  Eric Blair telling the truth is a revolutionary act and here's the big secret, the people
[15:26.200 --> 15:34.760]  on CNN, on MSNBC, on NPR and Fox News to a certain extent they know that they're there
[15:34.760 --> 15:43.360]  in this good old boy club creating a facade, they're hunting us, they're part of the quote
[15:43.360 --> 15:47.440]  ruling class, they're part of the predator class at least they delusionally think, it's
[15:47.440 --> 15:53.000]  like going duck hunt and throwing decoys out in the lake, well of course you know you're
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.720]  throwing decoys out so the dumb ducks think it's safe and come and land and if a duck
[15:57.720 --> 16:01.280]  could talk and say hey you're setting me up you're putting decoys out there that's not
[16:01.280 --> 16:07.680]  very nice, the hundreds say well yeah stupid duck that's what I do, they'll laugh at you,
[16:07.680 --> 16:13.080]  you talk to a news reporter high level, you talk to a banker, you talk to a globalist
[16:13.080 --> 16:15.960]  and you say what you're doing is dehumanizing, what you're doing is enslaving, what you're
[16:15.960 --> 16:20.280]  doing creates a horrible world in the future and they laugh at you and go tell me something
[16:20.280 --> 16:23.920]  I don't know, you're never going to change it, might as well join it and enjoy your life
[16:23.920 --> 16:30.680]  now and it's that cynical attitude by the establishment is what ends up destroying our
[16:30.680 --> 16:36.800]  entire culture, our entire world because these people are walking dead, they know what's
[16:36.800 --> 16:42.040]  going on, they understand human nature but they don't have that final piece to want
[16:42.040 --> 16:49.000]  to try to do the right thing and be honorable and build a larger continuum of humanity.
[16:49.000 --> 16:58.400]  But I'm digressing, I gotta get to the news, what I'm trying to quantify here is they deceive
[16:58.400 --> 17:03.720]  the public by getting the public to buy into the false system even though some of the public
[17:03.720 --> 17:13.560]  is more sophisticated understands that most of it's a complete fraud, still they sit up
[17:13.560 --> 17:19.920]  there and talk about well if she says this she'll win and if Trump says that he'd win
[17:19.920 --> 17:27.560]  to make you think that you win by comporting yourself into what the supposed polls or the
[17:27.560 --> 17:33.840]  supposed pundits say is a winning strategy, you've just given up your free will, you've
[17:33.840 --> 17:37.920]  just given up being original, you've just given up being outside the box, you've given
[17:37.920 --> 17:45.320]  up being an innovator, a trailblazer, you have in a split second comported yourself into
[17:45.320 --> 17:58.120]  their system, into their universe, into their little fake facsimile that's supposed to draw
[17:58.120 --> 18:04.160]  in everybody's attention where the establishment sets the trends and the establishment sets
[18:04.160 --> 18:08.760]  the agenda and the establishment sets the fads and the establishment decides the culture
[18:08.760 --> 18:15.720]  and then we see the culture, they're giving us it's living death and they go well of course
[18:15.720 --> 18:20.000]  we're giving you living death, we're turning you off, we're ending your life force, we're
[18:20.000 --> 18:25.800]  ending your self sufficiency, we're ending your survival instinct, the world's ours,
[18:25.800 --> 18:37.240]  we're killing you, we don't give our kids iPads, Apple says but we give money to LGBT so it's
[18:37.240 --> 18:44.840]  okay that we have suicide nets and forced abortion and 17 hour work days and the Foxconn
[18:44.840 --> 18:51.400]  workers children live in metal containers, it's all right because Al Gore's on the board
[18:51.400 --> 19:00.040]  and he talks with a lisp and it's all right because he acts effeminate and nilly but not
[19:00.040 --> 19:07.880]  behind closed doors, no, no, no, that's not how Al talks behind closed doors, see it's
[19:07.880 --> 19:13.200]  all a fraud and I know you know that but we have to have the understanding of the complete
[19:13.200 --> 19:20.840]  collapse of it in our minds ourselves and disdain it, dislike it, hate it, not go ooh
[19:20.840 --> 19:26.760]  you were on Fox and CNN and MSNBC today Alex, ooh I saw you in some movie did you know you're
[19:26.760 --> 19:33.320]  in this movie, no, I don't care, I don't care about any of their system, none of it, none
[19:33.320 --> 19:38.720]  of it, it's all fake the last 60 years, I don't want to follow any of it, I don't care,
[19:38.720 --> 19:45.280]  I don't want its laurels, I don't want its awards, I am divorced from it, I am separate
[19:45.280 --> 19:51.360]  from it, it's damned and by damned it's being on the other side of me, I don't see it now,
[19:51.360 --> 19:56.480]  see it's over there, I'm free from there, I'm going to come back and kind of put a carry
[19:56.480 --> 20:00.200]  on top of this and get to the big news and boy it's a big news day, the facade is falling.

[24:22.240 --> 24:29.440]  The technocrat social engineers are our mortal enemies. They admit they are. They're eugenicists.
[24:29.440 --> 24:35.040]  They are manipulating us with high tech propaganda that has been developed for thousands of years,
[24:35.040 --> 24:41.160]  but now has been brought to a high science. But as a species, if we're aware of that,
[24:41.160 --> 24:46.960]  it's came over. But people have to understand what you're hearing here from me is not my
[24:46.960 --> 24:57.920]  opinion. When I say something's my opinion, I will tell you it's my opinion. When I explain
[24:57.920 --> 25:04.360]  the global government planetary project to bring in a one world religion and reduce
[25:04.360 --> 25:10.540]  the world's population by 80%, that's the official UN policy. Look it up for yourself.
[25:10.540 --> 25:20.960]  That is a fact, not an opinion. And you and I and all of us have to deal with that. So
[25:20.960 --> 25:24.840]  I just took 12 minutes in the last segment to say something I could say in 30 seconds.
[25:24.840 --> 25:29.960]  I said to the crew, I said, does that make sense? And Ali said, yeah, they use the media
[25:29.960 --> 25:34.960]  and political systems to manipulate us and deceive us. Yeah, we know that. I'm like,
[25:34.960 --> 25:39.560]  here's the big secret. But the big secret is one of their number one tools is to act
[25:39.560 --> 25:45.600]  like they actually set the parameters and then have us opt into it and repeat what
[25:45.600 --> 25:51.720]  they say and do so that we think we're winners and we're intellectual. It's not intellectual
[25:51.720 --> 25:58.080]  to repeat talking points from Fox News or CNN in a controlled paradigm. We have to break
[25:58.080 --> 26:04.280]  with it and say it's phony, it's fake, it's fraudulent, it's sleazy, and we've got to
[26:04.280 --> 26:13.120]  build something new. That building is condemned. It's going to collapse, not, hey, let's put
[26:13.120 --> 26:19.400]  some more pain on it. That's what I'm getting at. And we're reaching that point in every
[26:19.400 --> 26:26.360]  metric in every poll in every study and in what you see on the street. On the surface,
[26:26.360 --> 26:32.120]  you look at it, you can see it, you look deeper, it just gets worse. And so when we come back,
[26:32.120 --> 26:38.040]  the big news, I'm not really good at starting the broadcast and saying, look at all this
[26:38.040 --> 26:45.000]  incredible stuff we're going to cover. I almost like a man standing on the edge of a cliff
[26:45.000 --> 26:54.680]  for 10, 20, 30 minutes. Don't even get into it because it's so over the top. I don't feel
[26:54.680 --> 27:02.480]  worthy to be covering this info. I mean, we should have the greatest minds, we should
[27:02.480 --> 27:09.280]  have the smartest people, we should have any thinking person should be fighting the world
[27:09.280 --> 27:15.400]  government project with everything they've got. Because this thing is not some kumbaya
[27:15.400 --> 27:22.320]  Star Trek future. It's really dark. It's really bad. And even those of us that are awake are
[27:22.320 --> 27:26.280]  just becoming complacent that, okay, they sell body parts, okay, they keep babies alive,
[27:26.280 --> 27:32.400]  okay, they're splicing humans with animals and growing them inside cows. Big deal. Alex,
[27:32.400 --> 27:38.560]  so what? Okay, so there is a secret geoengineering program. Okay. And then I sit here getting
[27:38.560 --> 27:42.400]  more and more upset. I know many of you get more and more upset. We have to ask, what
[27:42.400 --> 27:46.840]  is it about us that we have our survival instinct, that we have our instinct to live, our instinct
[27:46.840 --> 27:53.600]  to resist evil. And I think it's spiritual. Like, I know it's spiritual. But if you really
[27:53.600 --> 27:57.880]  study it, what our genetics are, that's why they say, you know, in certain bloodlines,
[27:57.880 --> 28:03.200]  you get bad bloodlines, you get good bloodlines. You get certain family bloodlines that have
[28:03.200 --> 28:07.040]  murderers and killers or mentally ill people on them. You have certain bloodlines that have
[28:07.040 --> 28:11.380]  incredible musicians in them of every race, color, and creed. You have certain bloodlines
[28:11.380 --> 28:19.000]  that are idiot savants at mathematics, certain bloodlines that lead revolutions for good,
[28:19.000 --> 28:25.640]  some that lead them for evil. And my bloodline, as I get older, I realize is like a book.
[28:25.640 --> 28:29.440]  It's running me. I'm not running myself. I mean, my spirit, my gut is making the final
[28:29.440 --> 28:35.200]  decision, but I'm pushed in the way of resisting this and can't help it and just burn with
[28:35.200 --> 28:39.120]  uncontrollable energy to where I hate myself that I don't have more strength and take these
[28:39.120 --> 28:42.640]  people on because I can see who they are and what they're doing and how they're lying
[28:42.640 --> 28:46.520]  to people and how they're hurting people. Now they want to make people stupid and make
[28:46.520 --> 28:53.000]  them poor so they can rule them. And that's the ultimate sin in my view. Suffer the little
[28:53.000 --> 28:56.800]  children because what you do to the least of these you've done to me better for a man
[28:56.800 --> 29:01.000]  to tie a giant boulder around his neck and throw it in the deepest ocean than to hurt
[29:01.000 --> 29:05.680]  one of these. And Christ isn't just talking about children there, but childlike people
[29:05.680 --> 29:10.960]  that are ignorant, people that are mentally ill, people that are retarded, people that
[29:10.960 --> 29:21.120]  have physical issues, people that are gullible and want to buy into the latest cosmology.
[29:21.120 --> 29:28.680]  When you sit there and you know the secrets and you use those secrets to keep people in
[29:28.680 --> 29:36.880]  an artificial state of ignorance and to control them, you have got God just waiting to tear
[29:36.880 --> 29:45.880]  you limb from limb. And you're not going to have to wait till you die. When I come back,
[29:45.880 --> 29:49.880]  I'm going to get to the really big news. It's so huge.
[29:49.880 --> 30:00.880]  Where on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.880 --> 30:07.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, teleprompter in chief, unedited. If we turn against each other based
[30:07.640 --> 30:22.960]  on divisions of race or religion, if we fall for, you know, a bunch of okey-doke, just
[30:22.960 --> 30:34.280]  because, you know, it sounds funnier. The tweets are provocative.
[30:34.280 --> 30:42.280]  Always trying to make Trump look bad, but he won't be debating Trump. Hillary will.
[30:42.280 --> 30:46.600]  Well, first of all, they're just words. She reads off a teleprompter. You notice she's
[30:46.600 --> 30:51.960]  reading off a teleprompter. She always does. She really doesn't have her own words.
[30:51.960 --> 30:54.280]  It should be fun.
[30:54.280 --> 31:19.280]  I'm David Knight and I'll see you in the next one.
[31:19.280 --> 31:45.280]  I'm David Knight and I'll see you in the next one.

[32:57.440 --> 33:17.320]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[33:17.320 --> 33:35.940]  infowar.
[33:35.940 --> 33:41.580]  and prisonplanet.com. Trump turns Obama into a stuttering mess. That's up on
[33:41.580 --> 33:45.580]  drugs. We're gonna play that video in that audio. Hillary says Trump the threat
[33:45.580 --> 33:51.180]  to the world. Paglia says zombie time at Clinton campaigns. Well, she's a zombie
[33:51.180 --> 34:02.220]  candidate for zombies. We are going to be breaking all of that down today. But you
[34:02.220 --> 34:08.060]  notice that there's a theme in the news the last month or so and that oh Facebook
[34:08.060 --> 34:12.420]  censoring people and oh Google's starting to do it more. Oh and Apple's
[34:12.420 --> 34:19.980]  doing it really hardcore and Twitter is and anything right of mouse the tongue.
[34:19.980 --> 34:27.300]  I mean Google puts famous Maoist you know on their birthday up on their front
[34:27.300 --> 34:31.340]  page that you know they called for killing any capitalist or taking farmers
[34:31.340 --> 34:35.100]  off their property. You know putting them in forced labor. That was last week.
[34:35.100 --> 34:37.940]  And of course these are people worth hundreds of billions of dollars wanting
[34:37.940 --> 34:41.380]  you know telling us Mao say tongue supporters are great. It's because it's
[34:41.380 --> 34:46.700]  authoritarianism and they want to scramble reality. But you notice there's a
[34:46.700 --> 34:51.540]  theme and that's we need to get rid of free speech and then they announced on
[34:51.540 --> 34:59.060]  Monday. Oh yes any mention of race or religion just period will ban you or
[34:59.060 --> 35:03.900]  Facebook says if you hurt someone's feelings or quote disagree with them
[35:03.900 --> 35:11.660]  that's a quote will will ban you. Three strikes and you're out. And now the EU
[35:11.660 --> 35:15.580]  saying oh yes we're gonna prosecute people and they are prosecuting people
[35:15.580 --> 35:21.540]  and so is Canada. I mean if you want to say you don't think transgenderism
[35:21.540 --> 35:28.340]  exists then that's your right to say it whether you're right or wrong. So we're
[35:28.340 --> 35:38.260]  seeing the basic framework stripped. And I harp on this because Matt Drudge came
[35:38.260 --> 35:43.460]  here like Paul Revere last year nine months ago and raised the alarm in this
[35:43.460 --> 35:48.500]  studio and said I have been told we're running out of time next year they're
[35:48.500 --> 35:53.220]  launching the project to take the First Amendment away and then all of their
[35:53.220 --> 36:00.220]  amendments will fall after. And now all Hades is breaking loose it's happening. I
[36:00.220 --> 36:04.700]  mean look at these headlines Facebook Twitter banning free speech to form
[36:04.700 --> 36:10.700]  virtual super state. Billions people use Facebook it's the biggest state in the
[36:10.700 --> 36:15.100]  world that's the founder of the Pirate Bay and he said Zuckerberg is the
[36:15.100 --> 36:18.940]  dictator of it and he's one of the 125 members of Bilderberg. They're all the
[36:18.940 --> 36:23.860]  dictators over the big corporations and the systems that have carved up the
[36:23.860 --> 36:28.700]  world and they've exempted themselves from everything they're doing to us down
[36:28.700 --> 36:31.900]  to Zuckerberg having big fences around his house and buying up the
[36:31.900 --> 36:37.340]  neighborhood and building a bunker and down to Google suppressing search
[36:37.340 --> 36:47.900]  results for the homes and the activities of Schmidt. He says anything you do on
[36:47.900 --> 36:52.380]  the internet you better watch it. There's another creepy statement from him the
[36:52.380 --> 36:55.580]  other day about you know we know everything you're doing. We know all
[36:55.580 --> 36:59.580]  your deep dark secrets these people are flaunting it in our face what they're
[36:59.580 --> 37:04.340]  doing to us and they're so historically arrogant and ignorant they think they can
[37:04.340 --> 37:11.180]  build something like this and it's not gonna bite them in the butt. Now we
[37:11.180 --> 37:15.940]  literally should have a drumroll that's the Reddit CEO we know your dark
[37:15.940 --> 37:20.220]  secrets we know everything. Huffman stoves controversy with creepy
[37:20.220 --> 37:26.220]  remarkable these are creepy people. I mean who wouldn't start a tech company or
[37:26.220 --> 37:29.260]  an operation and then want to make it about promoting liberty and protecting
[37:29.260 --> 37:32.540]  privacy instead they've built the internet so it's based on not having
[37:32.540 --> 37:36.740]  privacy and so the fraud the identity theft all of it and then they come in
[37:36.740 --> 37:40.700]  and say we need a global internet ID that would send us for 10 years a day of
[37:40.700 --> 37:45.340]  us that's been leaked out of Bilderberg for close to 20. You can go back 20 years
[37:45.340 --> 37:49.140]  where we say they will bring in a world government, a carbon tax, a well-head
[37:49.140 --> 37:53.260]  tax, a Tobin tax, everything will be tracked by computers even if it's off
[37:53.260 --> 37:59.900]  the internet the smart grid the internet of things will surveil all and end any
[37:59.900 --> 38:03.860]  quote underground economies for total control then they can truly manage
[38:03.860 --> 38:08.740]  economies and control them and predict the future and if you can predict the
[38:08.740 --> 38:12.460]  future in mass movements in their own words you can then put in stimuli and
[38:12.460 --> 38:21.980]  steer the future now we're giving godlike power to tech execs flying around on
[38:21.980 --> 38:30.220]  jumbo jets with 30 or 40 hookers at a time these are not serious men ladies
[38:30.220 --> 38:37.820]  and gentlemen they are all partying upwards of five ten hours a day on
[38:37.820 --> 38:46.660]  record while they build something that is an attempt at omnipresent godlike
[38:46.660 --> 38:52.820]  behavior talk about the Atlantean moment whether Atlantis was real or not
[38:52.820 --> 38:56.740]  we're nearing that moment with the nuclear reactors and the fish infusion
[38:56.740 --> 39:00.660]  and the and the Hadron colliders and the cyclotrons and all the other secret
[39:00.660 --> 39:04.860]  stuff and the GMO and the genetic engineering and all of this craziness
[39:04.860 --> 39:08.980]  just out of control Pandora's boxes thousands of Pandora's boxes is just
[39:08.980 --> 39:18.380]  open you got a bunch of CEOs flying around on jumbo jets where they admit
[39:18.380 --> 39:22.420]  the Google jumbo jet they have a couple of jumbo jets is just nothing but
[39:22.420 --> 39:27.300]  bedrooms with glass ceilings and just you see all these gorgeous women packing
[39:27.300 --> 39:30.620]  on the plane and I'm not jealous of the fact they got these gorgeous women I'm
[39:30.620 --> 39:33.540]  glad that you know Google isn't into what the Congress is little boys and
[39:33.540 --> 39:42.460]  stuff but the point is they're running stuff that I wouldn't trust you know the
[39:42.460 --> 39:47.100]  Archangel Michael to be in control of and we got these guys in control and
[39:47.100 --> 39:50.820]  that's just one small little example you know Clinton's flying around on the jet
[39:50.820 --> 39:55.700]  you know to the Pito Island yeah there's that's my point is these people are
[39:55.700 --> 39:59.460]  corrupt they're falling and they're playing with fire and they get off with
[39:59.460 --> 40:02.220]  the fact they're playing with fire and say we don't care if it even blows up it
[40:02.220 --> 40:05.860]  does something horrible at least we died trying to become gods to quote Ray
[40:05.860 --> 40:11.580]  Kurzweil I've got the quotes in my film in game where all these top transhumanist
[40:11.580 --> 40:14.740]  are saying we're gonna become gods or blow the planet up doing it they said
[40:14.740 --> 40:17.580]  the fact we can't become gods we're gonna blow the planet up that's what one
[40:17.580 --> 40:20.660]  quote by him we might just blow the planet up for fun just because we want
[40:20.660 --> 40:28.020]  to be satanic that's what happens when you're that decadent so drum roll
[40:28.020 --> 40:33.180]  ladies and gentlemen Kit Daniels has this article up on info wars.com and
[40:33.180 --> 40:38.700]  it's gotten no attention it I've not seen anywhere else and neither has Kit
[40:38.700 --> 40:42.100]  Daniels it was mentioned in a Breitbart article and Breitbart does a great job we
[40:42.100 --> 40:49.420]  got had a Breitbart coming on a couple days or is it next week this is so huge
[40:49.420 --> 40:53.100]  and then I got the document and sure enough what Kit wrote in there is in
[40:53.100 --> 40:58.340]  there he's got the screenshots of it this is such a big deal if they started
[40:58.340 --> 41:01.460]  taking the free speech worldwide what anybody notice if Zuckerberg met with
[41:01.460 --> 41:05.180]  the kind of shiny sensors scores of times last two years and openly says
[41:05.180 --> 41:08.700]  they're bringing that style censorship here would anyone pay attention if he
[41:08.700 --> 41:12.660]  called his users dumb efforts would anybody care or were they just grovel
[41:12.660 --> 41:15.660]  I might want to start a fight with Zuckerberg I don't want to be kicked
[41:15.660 --> 41:20.420]  off Facebook I know we're reaching millions people a day there but I have
[41:20.420 --> 41:24.660]  to because they're they're incrementally cutting off all the little people and
[41:24.660 --> 41:28.460]  I'm not stupid when they're banning thousands of libertarians and patriots
[41:28.460 --> 41:33.980]  and veterans groups and people that mildly criticize Obama every day we're
[41:33.980 --> 41:37.100]  next you know back when we weren't so big Googled say you can't have a shopping
[41:37.100 --> 41:40.700]  cart you sell the Obama deception that's racist and suspended our shopping
[41:40.700 --> 41:44.980]  cart just because you can't criticize Obama that's racist they still suspended
[41:44.980 --> 41:48.300]  today but see they don't do it so much now because we're one of the bigger
[41:48.300 --> 41:52.540]  fishies we have a voice drudge would link to it it'd be covered in the news it
[41:52.540 --> 41:55.900]  would cause a debate it make me a cost to live but they are shutting little
[41:55.900 --> 42:00.420]  people down all over the world because they say something you're not little
[42:00.420 --> 42:04.900]  millions of people with their own blogs on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and
[42:04.900 --> 42:09.620]  reaching people together you're thousands of times bigger than info wars
[42:09.620 --> 42:15.140]  hundreds of times bigger than drudge and you're able to set the real agenda
[42:15.140 --> 42:19.500]  based on what humans are really thinking and gut instinct and common sense and
[42:19.500 --> 42:27.260]  survival instinct and and and God's discernment through you and they can't
[42:27.260 --> 42:31.940]  have that they want Mark Zuckerberg and his controllers to set the agenda they
[42:31.940 --> 42:36.140]  want the globalist to control Reddit to set the agenda they want the people that
[42:36.140 --> 42:42.420]  run Apple to set the agenda and so they have to start curtailing because the
[42:42.420 --> 42:46.620]  agenda that the people said is we don't trust the media we don't trust the
[42:46.620 --> 42:50.180]  system we're done with you we know you're corrupt and evil so they're just
[42:50.180 --> 42:54.180]  weaponizing things and going to the extreme of now you heard the new one
[42:54.180 --> 42:57.580]  Democrats are teaching their kids no matter what race or color or religion
[42:57.580 --> 43:02.780]  they are to say Donald Trump hates Jews or Donald Trump hates blacks we have
[43:02.780 --> 43:06.580]  these videos coming up and they indoctrinate their kids and the parents
[43:06.580 --> 43:10.440]  sound in the videos whether it be white or Hispanic well if I can follow the two
[43:10.440 --> 43:17.620]  latest ones like cult members tonight yes good good that's like Emperor
[43:17.620 --> 43:25.500]  Palpatine good good oh they sound so snake like like the snake in the the
[43:25.500 --> 43:32.180]  jungle book and so drumroll here's the big news just the latest the latest the
[43:32.180 --> 43:37.220]  every day at some new giant hammer dropping on free speech worldwide
[43:37.220 --> 43:44.460]  EU proposes government ID to use the Internet done done done info wars com
[43:44.460 --> 43:51.780]  present planet calm and here is the document European Commission calm 2016
[43:51.780 --> 43:57.220]  288 forward slash to communication from the Commission and by the way the
[43:57.220 --> 44:01.940]  elected Commission does the laws the Parliament is ceremonial and advisory

[44:27.940 --> 44:33.900]  Commission like the organized crime Commission all seated with a bunch of
[44:33.900 --> 44:40.020]  Bilderberg group Robert Barrett's communication it's not law it's a
[44:40.020 --> 44:47.140]  communication the Emperor has spoken the God Emperor has spoken but let me read
[44:47.140 --> 44:51.060]  it the way they would read it in the spirit of it communication from the
[44:51.060 --> 44:55.820]  Commission to the European Parliament the Council the European Economic and
[44:55.820 --> 45:02.980]  Social Committee and the Committee of the Regents just like in China from the
[45:02.980 --> 45:11.700]  Central Committee to the 67th Poland Bureau meeting the Commission has
[45:11.700 --> 45:20.700]  spoken the self-appointed Commission that commands through the barrel of a
[45:20.700 --> 45:32.980]  7.6239 round hiding in plain view communication I mean imagine how this
[45:32.980 --> 45:38.620]  this is how they communicate it's not like a bill you know it's communication
[45:38.620 --> 45:42.980]  from the Commission to the European Parliament the Council the European
[45:42.980 --> 45:49.660]  Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regents the Regents not

[46:03.820 --> 46:09.180]  market under corporations no votes a global dictatorship under the eye of
[46:09.180 --> 46:15.180]  Soran and then we get into your article and you have it all for the fact we
[46:15.180 --> 46:18.100]  ought to use screenshots of folks for this not just you know the digital text
[46:18.100 --> 46:21.100]  people love to see the screenshot it actually gets them upset so whatever
[46:21.100 --> 46:23.820]  gets them upset and winning get some to know something's bad happening we
[46:23.820 --> 46:28.060]  probably screenshot this and or add this video to your article kid Daniels
[46:28.060 --> 46:33.460]  info wars.com reporter and it just says oh online ratings and reviews of goods
[46:33.460 --> 46:37.180]  the government will decide and control and regulate that that's the Chinese
[46:37.180 --> 46:41.340]  model where they quote give you an internet rating as a person on the web
[46:41.340 --> 46:45.780]  that even goes down if you have a job this is the mark of the beast buying or
[46:45.780 --> 46:52.340]  sell not engage in the commerce unless you're part of the club so kid there's
[46:52.340 --> 46:55.420]  a lot kid Daniels tell us about your articles on info wars.com he's to go
[46:55.420 --> 47:02.140]  mega viral I mean I don't even see mainline you know so-called watch dogs
[47:02.140 --> 47:05.140]  talking about this now because it's just a bum rush they're hitting us with
[47:05.140 --> 47:09.460]  everything the biggest assault on human liberty the most scientific assault the
[47:09.460 --> 47:13.940]  world has ever seen undoubtedly when I make that statement I am a hundred
[47:13.940 --> 47:18.580]  percent sure of it and you ask why are they doing it now because they're getting
[47:18.580 --> 47:22.500]  ready to implode the economy and launch big wars and try to start race wars and
[47:22.500 --> 47:27.060]  sectarian wars and then they have got a blueprint I mean you can feel it in your
[47:27.060 --> 47:31.060]  gut but I've gone from in my spider sense my sixth sense my discernment my
[47:31.060 --> 47:36.340]  spirit from being oh get ready good till like now just feeling energized because
[47:36.340 --> 47:43.460]  now I can tell the it's on folks any it's all and and and any fears that I was
[47:43.460 --> 47:46.940]  ever misleading anybody it was ever exaggerating I'm just peeled back and my
[47:46.940 --> 47:51.820]  confidence is spiked even more because unfortunately I know we are in an epic
[47:51.820 --> 47:56.180]  battle because when they shut down the free speech they're coming for
[47:56.180 --> 48:01.140]  everything and these people are blood thirsty look what they do to Christians
[48:01.140 --> 48:05.380]  everywhere they're in control kid Daniels and force.com report I want to say
[48:05.380 --> 48:08.900]  good job getting this out there I know this just came out like a day ago but
[48:08.900 --> 48:12.540]  I mean where is this well I mean I don't want to be the one ringing the alarm
[48:12.540 --> 48:16.340]  most the time up front that is not a good feeling you know to use a Vietnam
[48:16.340 --> 48:19.060]  analogy what they just say for you know year after year you're gonna walk in the
[48:19.060 --> 48:22.100]  front every day I'm like hey how about somebody else oh good somebody else
[48:22.100 --> 48:24.940]  supposed to be in the front today something I'm a coward it's just doesn't
[48:24.940 --> 48:30.140]  seem like good luck kid Daniels this is exactly it this is neo feudalism this is
[48:30.140 --> 48:33.700]  a way to tax and control the internet they don't want Matt Drudge with
[48:33.700 --> 48:37.860]  influence you know giving us spreading ideas of liberty on the internet they
[48:37.860 --> 48:40.300]  don't want out federal elections commission came out and said go after
[48:40.300 --> 48:43.620]  Drudge last week see they're all it exactly they want to turn the internet
[48:43.620 --> 48:47.180]  back into what television was like in the 1960s we're not only had a handful
[48:47.180 --> 48:49.780]  of stations and they controlled everything and I've not even stated some
[48:49.780 --> 48:52.860]  mad at myself kid I haven't stated how big this is and I've always said this
[48:52.860 --> 48:56.300]  forever when they come out with the internet ID that's to restrict you to
[48:56.300 --> 49:00.860]  rate you to ban you to track you to tax you as this is the end of the internet
[49:00.860 --> 49:03.740]  as we know I mean think about this way Facebook and Twitter is already one
[49:03.740 --> 49:06.140]  third of the internet where's all the internet traffic's going it's going
[49:06.140 --> 49:09.580]  straight to Facebook that's just like a TV station in the 1960s that they
[49:09.580 --> 49:13.500]  control where they can control the narrative they can control what spread
[49:13.500 --> 49:19.700]  they use PC suppression to exactly you know to destroy any competition to the
[49:19.700 --> 49:22.180]  government they're carving up the web now go over your article I mean you've
[49:22.180 --> 49:25.500]  got the subsections this is devastatingly evil yeah one thing I've
[49:25.500 --> 49:30.820]  brought to the really bothered me about this document is the fact that they're
[49:30.820 --> 49:35.320]  using that says the proliferation of online video sharing platforms the
[49:35.320 --> 49:39.460]  content that is harmful to minors and of hate speech yep but like they're gonna
[49:39.460 --> 49:44.060]  mix soft porn but they're gonna leave all the big Viacom and Sony women shaking
[49:44.060 --> 49:48.900]  their ends you know and and bikinis that's okay but absolutely they're
[49:48.900 --> 49:52.900]  gonna mix political speech in with porn and ban us they admit it yeah but like
[49:52.900 --> 49:57.860]  I said on Monday the EU is the ones that are deciding what is hate speech and to
[49:57.860 --> 50:01.900]  them hate speech is this anything that an unelected group of admitted
[50:01.900 --> 50:05.460]  communists and socialists working for above the law megabanks yeah anything
[50:05.460 --> 50:08.900]  that runs contrary to their agenda is hate speech to them you're not allowed to
[50:08.900 --> 50:12.860]  criticize the migrants raping women or they come arrest you yeah or even if you
[50:12.860 --> 50:16.140]  want to spread say Austrian economics online that's hate speech to them they
[50:16.140 --> 50:20.540]  drudges right they first are putting us into internet ghettos and then after
[50:20.540 --> 50:23.580]  you're in a ghetto and dehumanize and made poor and everybody forgets about you
[50:23.580 --> 50:27.580]  and segregated then you're moved to the electronic concentration camp so now
[50:27.580 --> 50:32.100]  they're moving to the allow I'm not kidding folks go ahead and what really
[50:32.100 --> 50:34.380]  I'm gonna skip this break cuz you know we're gonna have a show see if this keeps
[50:34.380 --> 50:39.100]  going I mean we're in a Mayday emergency situation yeah on Monday I believe
[50:39.100 --> 50:42.500]  when I saw this article on drudge when I woke up in the morning this Bloomberg
[50:42.500 --> 50:47.340]  article it bought what really bothered me about it was how bad they downplayed
[50:47.340 --> 50:50.660]  it oh they sell it like exactly it's real oh we're gonna you know anything
[50:50.660 --> 50:54.380]  cultural racial or religious we're sorry just gonna be banned sorry it's like oh
[50:54.380 --> 50:58.060]  yeah well we're gonna just make more censorship you know all the tech companies
[50:58.060 --> 51:01.660]  all just announced the last 24 hours they're gonna sign an agreement with the
[51:01.660 --> 51:05.980]  EU to let them direct oh and Facebook already beta tested hiring former
[51:05.980 --> 51:12.580]  Stasi commanders oh it's all seamless integration they're merging the tech
[51:12.580 --> 51:17.020]  giants with the global government the Asia Pacific Union through the TPP
[51:17.020 --> 51:21.220]  merges the Atlantic Union which is the NA you North American Union and the
[51:21.220 --> 51:25.980]  European Union they are merging the three super states with the 10 sub regions
[51:25.980 --> 51:32.060]  now with 10 sub regions per region directly out of revelations yeah what's
[51:32.060 --> 51:35.100]  really bizarre to me is the one-world government they're pushing isn't an
[51:35.100 --> 51:37.820]  electronic super state I mean think about this way you said this on the
[51:37.820 --> 51:41.900]  broadcast couple weeks ago about how Facebook is transforming our culture you
[51:41.900 --> 51:44.940]  never longer see national identities or culture because everyone's going on
[51:44.940 --> 51:49.220]  Facebook so now you have what they call a global culture which which which then
[51:49.220 --> 51:52.180]  is dictated by the technocrats and let's go further can guys pull this up I
[51:52.180 --> 51:55.220]  think it was like seven years ago it was an EU director that actually started
[51:55.220 --> 51:59.540]  moving new franchises aren't the Spaniards or the other you know the
[51:59.540 --> 52:04.940]  French or you know the lion rampant for jolly old England that's that's racist
[52:04.940 --> 52:08.420]  they actually say on the news you know don't fly British flags they're racist
[52:08.420 --> 52:11.180]  in England they're taking them down and that's the government I mean I'm not
[52:11.180 --> 52:14.580]  joking you can pull that up well now they're saying don't have sports teams
[52:14.580 --> 52:18.580]  with national names it's gonna be the Tyrannosaurus is it's gonna be the
[52:18.580 --> 52:23.540]  dragons it's gonna be the Grizzlies seriously that was announced you can't
[52:23.540 --> 52:27.140]  even have a team with the nation then it's you can't have a family you can't
[52:27.140 --> 52:29.900]  have a mother you can't have a father people think I'm well the user think I
[52:29.900 --> 52:33.540]  was joking it's all here get down think about this way English the English
[52:33.540 --> 52:36.940]  language it got spread by the English Empire Spanish same thing Spanish
[52:36.940 --> 52:41.100]  Empire now what we have is the Twitter language the dumbed-down language of a
[52:41.100 --> 52:44.580]  hundred forty smart characters or less it's just spreading globally that's a
[52:44.580 --> 52:47.900]  new that's right it's you they tried to have that other language that George
[52:47.900 --> 52:52.180]  Soros's dad pushed for world government and that failed so now it is the the
[52:52.180 --> 52:57.660]  emoji dumbed-down best friend ever garbage yeah and think about this way
[52:57.660 --> 53:01.300]  people can't they can't think intellectually anymore when the language
[53:01.300 --> 53:04.780]  is so dumb down they think they're only thinking on like a grade two level I
[53:04.780 --> 53:09.900]  know and man I tell you this is so incredible this is this is the global
[53:09.900 --> 53:13.580]  dumbing down they admit the screen time dumps you down they admit Facebook the
[53:13.580 --> 53:16.860]  way kids use it dumps them down and it could be used for good but the way they
[53:16.860 --> 53:22.620]  tailored it it is to boil everything down reduce language we're we're now a dumb
[53:22.620 --> 53:25.220]  person of the day will be a genius in 20 years folks and you want to be able to
[53:25.220 --> 53:28.300]  communicate with young people then we're not attacking the young people
[53:28.300 --> 53:31.980]  there's a project to make you stupid well you can't communicate with them
[53:31.980 --> 53:35.100]  anyway right now unless you talk to them over text messaging because people are
[53:35.100 --> 53:38.300]  so addicted their cell phones and whatnot it's just like you fill up k-dick
[53:38.300 --> 53:42.340]  book everyone's already connected in this electronic wirehead yeah cyberpunks
[53:42.340 --> 53:50.940]  they they have target psychosis mm-hmm and people get so focused on that phone
[53:50.940 --> 53:54.460]  and so interfaced with it it is destroying their minds you know I let
[53:54.460 --> 53:57.820]  my children when they go to a camp or go to a friend's house to have a phone and
[53:57.820 --> 54:00.740]  they like to take photos and shoot videos are very creative I thought you
[54:00.740 --> 54:04.380]  know I'll let them have a globalist slave fracker system I explain to them
[54:04.380 --> 54:07.260]  that it's an evil system that it's bad then you understand it but you know what
[54:07.260 --> 54:12.020]  it's so seductive it's so seducing I've just taken away finally and I'm just
[54:12.020 --> 54:15.580]  sorry you can have a camera for camera and you can make films you can edit
[54:15.580 --> 54:18.940]  things you can do this and be great photographers and do all these great
[54:18.940 --> 54:22.820]  things but this this this this is too evil and it's too dangerous and I'm
[54:22.820 --> 54:27.460]  taking it away from even when they go you know to a friend's house or going to
[54:27.460 --> 54:31.180]  hike or whatever you know you think it's a good thing to have that but overall
[54:31.180 --> 54:35.940]  it's so wicked in the final equation I just can't be done now getting back to
[54:35.940 --> 54:39.300]  you kit let's go over the article you proposes government ID to use internet
[54:39.300 --> 54:44.260]  this is the final key in announcements this is the final weapon being rolled
[54:44.260 --> 54:48.300]  out in the arsenal as I've told you for close to two decades when they call for
[54:48.300 --> 54:51.060]  internet ID by law to track you everywhere and for over a decade
[54:51.060 --> 54:54.940]  Microsoft has a software on all its programs for thumbprint access and
[54:54.940 --> 54:59.060]  governments leak your data governments it's always big banks of governments
[54:59.060 --> 55:02.620]  cause the big data thefts and their answer is we got to go to a biometric
[55:02.620 --> 55:07.020]  face scan thumbprint handprint or voice print integrated system so now all the
[55:07.020 --> 55:10.580]  TSA won't grow because of this tunnel oh but we're still gonna grow up you now
[55:10.580 --> 55:15.140]  sometimes though so oh you get special rights if you submit to it now that's
[55:15.140 --> 55:18.540]  just to make it standardized and ubiquitous oh the hundred fifty thousand
[55:18.540 --> 55:22.180]  dollar Mercedes it's already a driverless car when you don't drive good it takes
[55:22.180 --> 55:27.820]  over for you it'll save lives you pay extra to be a slave you pay extra to be
[55:27.820 --> 55:32.780]  the first group to beta test it and so they have the elite like like you know
[55:32.780 --> 55:37.260]  Chinese impertices with bound feet and four foot long fingernails who can't
[55:37.260 --> 55:41.500]  feed themselves or wipe their own arse that's the same modern version of this
[55:41.500 --> 55:46.460]  where you think it's all empowering you and you have the latest ooh as a status
[55:46.460 --> 55:54.660]  symbol oh this is the latest chains around your soul I'm gonna hold you over
[55:54.660 --> 55:58.060]  because you get me so excited your article so powerful this is powerful
[55:58.060 --> 56:01.580]  every point you make about how they're reducing us the global Facebook language
[56:01.580 --> 56:05.980]  of gibbering idiots where everyone's wearing goggles in a false reality but
[56:05.980 --> 56:11.020]  Zuckerberg walks like a god bipedal with his with his pronounced canine
[56:11.020 --> 56:17.060]  smiling the wolf amongst the legless armless sheep what an archetype bring
[56:17.060 --> 56:19.300]  on a break I'm gonna come out with kid nails with more on this this is this is
[56:19.300 --> 56:24.020]  absolutely essential folks I cannot put a bad enough face on this but we need a
[56:24.020 --> 56:28.460]  bad face on it to wake up to it to overthrow the facade in our own minds
[56:28.460 --> 56:32.660]  and realize we are being overtaken by a group of psychopaths that are building
[56:32.660 --> 56:36.380]  an artificial reality to insert us into it so that we're anesthetized and
[56:36.380 --> 56:43.020]  culturally numbed when we're put through the shredder that's gonna be done
[56:43.020 --> 56:46.460]  incrementally but the final group will be the elites not controlled by the
[56:46.460 --> 56:49.820]  globalist and you will wish later you would have joined me in the fight
[56:49.820 --> 56:52.980]  against these people you've got the know-how the capacity you know I'm
[56:52.980 --> 56:56.660]  telling the truth but you don't have enough faith in humanity to make a

[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:25.760]  vile people these anti-liberals that call themselves liberals. Kit Deyles has
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.420]  written a very powerful article he's here as a reporter so we're humanizing
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:32.140]  the story of the guy that is basically breaking the fact that the EU is just
[01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:35.340]  announcing what they're gonna do and they let the parliament quote have a
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:38.100]  look at it but then they always do whatever they want so the articles up
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:41.940]  on infowars.com it's a way to tax the internet track it and kick you off of
[01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:45.380]  it and they admit that's their plan they're gonna give you an internet
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:50.460]  rating that you guys put me that article from a few months ago it was big news
[01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:53.780]  whenever they said you know the Chinese are gonna have a you know internet
[01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:58.860]  social rating oh it sounds so cute no it's it's a government approval to be
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:03.220]  online and then the government with tech giants saying who you are what type of
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:06.860]  person you are and labeling you well they're gonna say I'm a Nazi I mean
[01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:10.740]  what do they say about Trump China's social credit Beijing sets up huge system
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:14.940]  BBC doesn't talk about how nightmarish that is you've got the floor Kit Deyles
[01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:18.780]  go ahead and break down this article and then the subsections of what this
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:22.860]  dictatorship has announced. Well like I said in the article it's the fact that
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:27.660]  not only are they gonna be able to track what you buy by your online government
[01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:30.820]  ID but what they also want you to do is be able to kind of track what you say
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:34.420]  make sure that you know you're not spreading so-called hate speech or
[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:38.220]  talking badly about a company anonymously. This is what the Chinese
[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:43.420]  government wants. Yeah and I also want to briefly point out that you know a lot
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:46.220]  of people are online already making comparisons between this and the mark of
[01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:50.540]  the beast in the book of revelations and you know the one thing that the mark of
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:55.220]  the beast says is about the I believe the mark on your hand now think about it
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:58.580]  this you know what's the you gonna do next they're gonna push for biometric
[01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:01.540]  ID they're gonna push for election you know that's what internet ID that's how
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:04.620]  it's controlled it's biometrically and how they're gonna do it is they got all
[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:10.700]  these Muslim migrants come in the country with fake passports fake IDs and
[01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:13.460]  whatnot so they're gonna so that's what they're gonna use they're just gonna
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:17.060]  false flag the whole migrant situation to say same thing they flood us with
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:20.940]  illegals and I exempt them and then make us some print 20 years in Texas yeah
[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:26.780]  yeah exactly and kind of still the same topic you know I was reading on a science
[01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:32.340]  you know these astronomers always wonder why the universe seems so desolate
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:35.180]  where's the life at and there's always been this what this theory called the
[01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:38.740]  great filter theory like their civilizations but at some certain point
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:43.780]  they collapse that's what really scares me right now Alex is I feel like
[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:47.100]  humanity we're going to hit this filter maybe that's why there's not any life
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:52.340]  that we know of in the galaxies because you see maybe they've had governments
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:57.660]  too and then well what happens is what makes a species great then creates
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:02.260]  incredible plenty and then predator groups rise out the predator class that
[01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:05.420]  want to base it on being predatory not on innovation and then things implode
[01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:10.100]  yeah or they advance technologies too quickly people get arrogant and you
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:12.580]  destroy the whole system yeah and this is something that people don't
[01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:15.700]  understand especially Bernie Sanders supporters is the government does not
[01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:18.900]  produce anything it's the people that produce the culture as people who just
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:24.700]  look at the supporters of socialism they're helpless stupid dumb morons
[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:28.860]  that think they're intellectual they can hardly walk yeah and then they think
[01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:31.740]  that well if the government's not there who can build the roads but it's like
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:35.060]  the government's the one going out and finding subcontractors to build the
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:37.900]  roads the government's not even building the roads they're not building NASA had
[01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:41.260]  all these subcontractors building all the and now they're trying to come out
[01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:43.740]  where the government does build roads when they do they can't do it yeah
[01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:47.060]  exactly it just ends up being like zigzag French government couldn't build
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:50.380]  Panama Canal the u.s. had to come in with private contract the only road the
[01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:55.180]  government can build is a road to surfdom is that a kid Daniels quote no I
[01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:58.420]  just came up with it you are genius sweet that right now real Alex Jones okay
[01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:01.340]  hit Daniels the only road the government can build is the road to slavery
[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:04.340]  because you know the public doesn't know I'm not our audience for the general
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:08.060]  public we have to dumb it down like Trump does to reach it down and pull them
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:10.980]  up we're not going to make them dumb yeah they won't know it's served to miss
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:14.140]  yeah it's like the headlines and stuff people accuse us being too
[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:17.380]  sensational but the thing is the public is so dumbed down they can't even reach
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:22.220]  the truth this is sensational they're always saying don't be sensational it's
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:26.900]  sensational when Microsoft and Apple and everyone say we need internet ID the EU
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:30.580]  is leading the way and they're beta testing it there for here and and all
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:34.060]  the new computers are coming out with biometrics and your stupid iPhone and
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:38.820]  Android tracks how much you walk and when you eat when you have sex yeah I mean
[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:43.380]  little spy bots the physical these are these are the what are the thing in doctor who
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:46.460]  they're going trying to kill you the it's like the space Odyssey obelisk to me
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:50.780]  the Daleks I just can't handle but I mean why do people want to go through this
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:54.740]  and then you figure out the leader about your pedophiles I mean no wonder they
[01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:57.980]  want all this control kid Daniels your article is so key it's got to go

[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:14.620]  study the six thousand plus years of chronicles human history patterns
[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:18.540]  become very very clear was once said that history doesn't repeat but it does
[01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:26.900]  rhyme every mainline political scientist mainline historians concur with our
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:33.340]  analysis of the last 20 years humanity is headed towards a collapse event and
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:38.460]  they codified that 1992 at the Rio de Janeiro meeting into agenda 21 a
[01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:44.420]  global plan for a post industrial world I am quoting from the document go read
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:49.340]  it at the UN website I've made four films on it if you're a new listener I'm
[01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:54.340]  not just saying this stuff and when Obama tells Africa you can't have cars you
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:58.820]  can't have air conditioning when he lands on a big jumbo jet with a red
[01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:05.380]  carpet and 15 airplanes and support a thousand support crew and $50 million a
[01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:12.340]  day or 45 million whatever his average trip is that is arrogance in your face
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:19.500]  that is absurdity but they are absurd on purpose to normalize bizarro world type
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:22.740]  activity not hey we're going to innovate cars we're going to innovate air
[01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:25.820]  conditioning we're going to innovate and have clean systems no no no they do
[01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:31.580]  those but only give it to themselves Larry Nichols gonna co-host with us for
[01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:36.460]  the balance the hour he as usual has big breaking news former top insider with
[01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:41.940]  the Clintons but the censorship is here as he warned as drudge warned as other
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:45.860]  folks that talk to big insiders have warned and believe me I've talked to
[01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:49.380]  them as well they are telling the Pentagon things and they are telling the
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:56.460]  military things that is absolutely making the brass even down to non-commissioned
[01:09:56.460 --> 01:10:02.820]  officers and the intelligent special forces type operators and everybody's
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:06.620]  intelligent the military but I said military's more intelligent on average
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:09.380]  in the general public but we have a dumbed-down society and there are a lot
[01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:12.340]  of people in supply or whatever been there one year or whatever don't know the
[01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:14.860]  other have them a whole around just like there could be an auto mechanic stupid
[01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:19.540]  right next to a guy that's really smart but the military is super awake okay
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:23.540]  because they're being trained to take guns and shut the internet off and arrest
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:27.380]  people and take over legislatures if states don't go along I mean that's in
[01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:31.940]  the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 they've been gearing up for
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:34.900]  this for a long time they've got civil emergency in Europe they're funding
[01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:39.540]  Arab Spring I mean it ain't coming it's already here just like we're a bit in
[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:47.500]  a depression in most areas this country we never left the recession and with
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:51.060]  cook numbers we got a 0.8% growth rate that's probably a negative two
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:54.460]  according to all the experts that actually go off real numbers that were
[01:10:54.460 --> 01:11:00.980]  used up until the 1980s so we're in an epic moment
[01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:05.380]  where our funny money is still buying stuff but not like it was and where the
[01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:07.700]  elites
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:16.780]  are headed to the hills so they can sit back and watch Rome burn and roast
[01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:21.820]  marshmallows in the flames that's how stupid they think we are and then they
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:26.900]  come out on Monday the top six tech giants led by Facebook who met with
[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:30.980]  Merkel on TV and said I'm gonna censor the internet hiring Stasi operatives
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:35.780]  last year to run the taddling to the police when people criticize open
[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:39.220]  borders and they come and arrest them under interpretations of hate speech
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:45.700]  now they've announced EU wide any criticism of government it says right
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:51.060]  wing hate speech in the document they mix that in with porn oh yeah but they
[01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:56.620]  openly push and this is from the communication from the Commission to
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:12:00.460]  the European Parliament and the Council the European Economic and Social
[01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:04.580]  Committee and the Committee of the Regents and this is from the European
[01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:09.300]  Commission and these commissions are what runs the EU the Parliament is
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:13.620]  ceremonial making it a dictatorship I that members of the parliament on you
[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:18.660]  can read it in the EU that's why the EU could never be voted on because you can't
[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:22.860]  have it be voted on at the beginning because that would begin to act like the
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:29.100]  votes were involved this is hidden in plain view at a massive level and this
[01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:37.700]  dovetails with China and our article Paul Joseph Watson December 23rd 2015 six
[01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:44.140]  months ago coming to America drudging to this article no one else cared I'm not
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:47.420]  kissing drudges but it's weird to sit here with just not even mainline
[01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:50.780]  libertarian or conservatives or other groups getting what's happening because
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:54.380]  it'd be too scary to report this is actually going on let's not report on
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:58.220]  Fox comm and suicide nets and forced abortions that's or mobile execution
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:06.500]  vans that's too scary that's too sensational well it is sensational like
[01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:11.740]  linen killing 20 million Russians reality sensational Paul pot killed 30% of
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:17.340]  his country anybody that could basically right was killed because all they want a
[01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:21.380]  bunch of trickly puffs and aid screels running around the social justice
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:25.740]  warriors who are dumb in the box of rocks and want to attack anybody who stands
[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:31.380]  up for freedom coming to America China reduces credit score for obedient
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:37.540]  citizens a internet social score and finally you'll just be banned if you
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:40.580]  criticize government or criticize corporations or anything and then you
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:44.260]  read in the EU Commission document on info wars.com what they say they're
[01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:49.540]  going to do it's like the EPA says oh we have a month of you know public comment
[01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:53.140]  and then we're gonna do what we want this Congress says we you know have that
[01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:57.180]  authority though Congress says you don't and the Supreme Court rules I can just
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:00.980]  operate freely on their own and just run around doing whatever they want it's
[01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:05.740]  called dictatorship it's a bunch of crooks stealing power in your face and
[01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:09.980]  thinking you're too stupid to know it now they're telling you mom and dad's a
[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:14.300]  bad word he or she's bad word and you know what we can't have American flags
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:18.580]  or British flags they're hateful they're hurtful and you read this thing won't
[01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:21.060]  learn nickels to hear this I want to talk about the free speech attacks we'll
[01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:25.460]  get it all the other news play a bunch of Trump clips we've got this is so
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:31.700]  chilling when you read this you know I mean this is crazy this is crazy what
[01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:34.700]  they're doing and again it's worse than just Obamacare where it gives them a
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:39.620]  blank check it does that as well but it just says we will decide we will
[01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:44.500]  interpret in the name of this the name of that
[01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:51.100]  and they say they're going to decide about online ratings and they're gonna
[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:54.300]  decide what you can say about sites and they're gonna make you have an ID so you
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:58.060]  can be taxed and traced and controlled they're gonna decide these people are
[01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:01.500]  resting folks all over Europe that criticize the open borders you wonder
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:07.300]  how they bring in five million Muslims out of war torn areas 80% of them
[01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:13.140]  military age men and they don't bring out of thousands of migrants they have
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:17.620]  less than 1% we covered that yesterday that are Christians when Syria is 20%
[01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:20.940]  Christian because they don't want them there they want to bring people in to
[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:24.580]  stir up trouble rape rob and kill and then when they do they come in and say
[01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:27.300]  we're gonna take everybody's free speech criticizing this to stop the
[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:32.500]  problems and I told you they do that and now they're doing it folks Larry
[01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:36.700]  Nichols joins us and of course he was a green beret and secret ops around the
[01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:41.860]  world that's how he got embedded with the Clintons be their handler with the
[01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:46.580]  CIA's front group the Dixie Mafia he's the guy behind the Clinton Chronicles and
[01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:50.300]  so much more and he's got a lot of big Trump news they don't know how much we
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:53.420]  can say on air but some very positive developments Trump's taking the gloves off
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:58.740]  and he wants to communicate to the Trump people directly today on this show for
[01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:02.420]  some specific reasons I don't know how much he wants to get into this about but
[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:08.380]  all this is unfolding this is accelerating and they wouldn't be
[01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:12.500]  openly announcing all this censorship worldwide and here domestically with
[01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:15.860]  Facebook launching all these purges if they didn't have big stuff about to
[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:21.540]  happen so Larry Nichols joins us Larry Nichols God bless you my friend obviously

[01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:55.540]  and you know what their bailing in plan is and I'm talking about the heads of
[01:18:55.540 --> 01:19:01.700]  these big five major banks you know what their plan to bail in means absolutely
[01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:05.020]  they're up to everything claim you got to save the system give themselves a
[01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:10.220]  limited trillions and then set the more governmental power given themselves the
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:16.340]  money they're gonna take your money claim that they have to repatriate your
[01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:20.340]  money to help pay the bills but they're planning to keep it for themselves
[01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:24.580]  they're gonna walk away from this thing so they think and they're gonna have all
[01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:30.060]  this money now the joke of jokes is if they'll look back in history usually
[01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:34.060]  when the dictators take power they've got all these cohorts that go with them
[01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:39.180]  but you know what Alex when when everything said done those cohorts are
[01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:43.420]  the first ones to go because dictators don't like people around them they don't
[01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:48.580]  like people around them that have made it and know where the bodies are buried
[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:52.340]  and they could use things against them in the future in every tyranny that's
[01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:57.020]  taken over in planetary history always the quizlings the minions the
[01:19:57.020 --> 01:20:01.060]  establishment wannabes the people that thought they were safe didn't realize
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:06.380]  there was a dossier for a night of the long knives to take them out the minute
[01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:11.420]  the real hammer drops absolutely and folks that's coming here the only thing
[01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:15.060]  that I would say before we go break Alex I skipped it it's too important we're
[01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:22.260]  not gonna see this continues everybody knows okay look guys listen to me I
[01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:27.620]  want to make I want to say a message if I may Alex Hillary come here girl look
[01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:33.620]  in my eyes girl let me tell you what's gonna happen here me and you and you
[01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:38.860]  either gonna have to go through me you're gonna have to go over me but you're
[01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:43.180]  not gonna be able to go around me this is going to be a match of this is your
[01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:54.420]  life and everything I know and you know I know is gonna come out so you better
[01:20:54.420 --> 01:21:00.020]  get right with Jesus because your chances of being president of the United
[01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:05.940]  States that you've wanted since four years old I assure you this day ain't
[01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:11.780]  going to happen now you know Alex with that I'd say to Hillary you know you
[01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:16.700]  better start looking if she would change today if she would change today and
[01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:22.780]  start thinking about the people of this country that would make a difference but
[01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:28.900]  you see she won't she won't Obama Obama has successfully stripped us of our
[01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:32.300]  three branches of government but you know where that came from that came
[01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:37.380]  from Bill Clinton the first day Bill Clinton took office ladies and gentlemen
[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:45.140]  please remember this he fired 111 federal prosecutors the first day in
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:52.460]  office now you know who appointed the ones to replace them Hillary why because
[01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:58.740]  you see they've got it said Obama does it they got it set up to where let's say
[01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:05.540]  you've got Hillary raping some woman downtown Little Rock Arkansas well if
[01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:09.580]  they control the federal prosecutors who are you going to go to to get them
[01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:15.860]  prosecuted then they came in and they have taken control of the Justice
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:23.060]  Department they have now fixed it thanks to Bill Clinton and yes George W. Bush
[01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:29.820]  and Barack Hussein Muslim Obama they have fixed it to where there are there
[01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:36.380]  is no longer three distinct co-equal branches of government Alex and that's
[01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:41.100]  why everything they've got set up to try to sit in the military if coalitions of
[01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:45.060]  states say no during martial law to go along with say arresting all the
[01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:48.260]  conservatives of the Patriots they're gonna try to send in special ops to take
[01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:51.740]  over the state houses but the special ops know they're being trained for this
[01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:57.220]  they know it's a setup the problem is they'll be big false flags blamed on
[01:22:57.220 --> 01:23:02.620]  Patriots kids kids school shot up you name it to try to sell the idea but I
[01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:06.460]  don't think that's gonna work I think the New World Order has bitten off more
[01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:10.740]  than they can chew studying the waterfront but unfortunately the
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:15.300]  battlefront the battlescape unfortunately though Larry Kripke we think
[01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:18.860]  I'm wrong it doesn't matter they're still going ahead so this is like a juggernaut
[01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:26.300]  about to run into another juggernaut this is gonna be explosive it is and I'll
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:32.460]  tell you right now the whole reason behind normalization of Cuba now I ran
[01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:36.820]  into the Cubans and nickel I ran into them in Afghanistan of all places I
[01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:41.780]  mean I'm there wherever the Soviet Union used to be they would send in
[01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:45.980]  Spressnaughts Alex and the Spressnaughts were the special ops like we have today
[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:50.860]  they would come in with their advisor Spressnaughts and then they bring in
[01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:55.820]  the they bring in the Cuban black hats they were the fighters they were the
[01:23:55.820 --> 01:24:04.340]  ones that did the dirty work now 600 at six hours 250,000 of those black hat
[01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:10.060]  Cubans can be in this country six hours Obama knows it everybody on the joint
[01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:14.460]  chief staff know it everybody that's working every day on the FEMA provisional
[01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:19.220]  government drawing board the ones that do the games every excuse me the games
[01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:24.340]  every day they know it so yeah we've got this big explosion because I do not
[01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:31.540]  believe Alex I do not I refuse to believe that Obama kill and rebuild anybody I
[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:36.100]  don't believe anybody is going to be able to take the American the United
[01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:40.820]  States of America soldier and get him to turn on the population it's just not
[01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:45.500]  gonna happen well listen I concur with everything you say other than the Cuba
[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:49.420]  thing I know you fought those guys I understand that they just used them
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:53.380]  over there in Syria and all the rest of it but I see the normalization
[01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:59.580]  happening but that would unify the American people to bring in foreigners
[01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:05.140]  but I look at all the Larica and Kista propaganda that's been done in most of
[01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:10.020]  country if it was pushed from that perspective and as a leftist overthrow
[01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:13.780]  it might actually work in certain sectors of the country and then that's
[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:16.740]  just to break up of the nation but do you think the elite would actually try
[01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:20.620]  something like that you bet they would look Alex this is what I'm trying to
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:26.220]  point out to the American people do you realize in this election so far thus far
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:32.620]  in this presidential election over half of the people that have voted in this
[01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:39.900]  primary have willfully voted for either an announced socialist or a
[01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:45.740]  progressive which is a another name for a communist in Hillary yeah you know
[01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:52.700]  they're looking right now this is what's driving this Alex the the elite see
[01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:59.060]  that they believe the American people are right they think it's now and the
[01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:03.860]  thing is they gotta do it now because just like we know this is our last
[01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:09.380]  election to where we're gonna be relevant they see this is the time and if
[01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:15.020]  they miss this window in time it may be 10 20 years before they ever know this
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:19.620]  nation back history is a vulnerability it's in now that elites do wild things
[01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:25.940]  and do bite off more than they can chew and I see them the activity at 50 times
[01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:29.660]  what it used to be and I see the color revolutions George Soros pulls in Europe
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:33.020]  in the Middle East and I and I see him running things and it looks like you know
[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:39.020]  he's got wide-body jets ready to get out of here in five minutes notice so so you
[01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:43.820]  may be right regardless there's a division cultural infighting Larry
[01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:47.900]  Nichols they're accelerating that the Justice Department's accelerating that
[01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:54.620]  how does that feed into this well what's happening right now if you look
[01:26:54.620 --> 01:27:00.420]  they've got the police in this nation to where every time they stick their head
[01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:08.420]  up and do their job they're prosecuted they're attacked viciously by the black
[01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:14.020]  community black lives matter and so what they're being forced into doing is
[01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:18.900]  being forced into retreat look at Chicago how many people this weekend were
[01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:26.540]  murdered in Chicago I don't know 40 60 whatever they're gonna get major cities
[01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:32.940]  Chicago Dallas Atlanta etc they're gonna get major cities in the situation to
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:39.140]  where the people Alex the people they're gonna go to the federal government and
[01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:46.020]  say dear God the police can't handle it send in the government and protect us
[01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:50.060]  that's what they're playing for Alex they're not playing so that's where
[01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:53.260]  everybody gets it I think a little wrong they think they're gonna come in as
[01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:58.340]  jack looted thugs marched down our street and and forced us into some now
[01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:01.660]  it's done in the first wave so the military thinks they're doing a good
[01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:06.660]  job because they're good people that's the first wave then the organizers the
[01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:10.700]  Socialist the National Security Force that Obama talked about this should be
[01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:14.060]  just as big and strong as our military it's in the next phase so it's an
[01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:17.500]  incremental takeover by the way Chicago the highest crime rate in the world last
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:24.260]  year it's doubled that this year and is set to quintuple again so clearly and
[01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:28.900]  that's the articles every day white racist police officers arrested people
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:34.540]  okay or or punch somebody okay prosecute them but is 20 black people
[01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:39.860]  killed in a single day or in a single weekend is by black people is that
[01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:45.700]  important or is it the racist cop I mean that they then project onto all the
[01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:52.380]  police to collapse the police and collapse the city that's right and then
[01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:56.620]  they break the backs and they break the hearts of our police and the police
[01:28:56.620 --> 01:29:01.140]  withdraw you know hey if you were a policeman and you're not going to be
[01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:05.980]  supported by the community to which you serve and protect if every time you do
[01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:10.300]  what is your job which is highly dangerous and puts you in various
[01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:16.660]  touching situations when you have to respond that same community that you're
[01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:21.940]  trying to protect that acts you not the people that you were protecting them
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:27.620]  from the police have gone to back up and that's all Obama and these
[01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:31.780]  indigenous need I know you're right I mean you've been involved you've been
[01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:34.780]  involved in the overthrow of countries you've been involved in stopping them and
[01:29:34.780 --> 01:29:37.500]  I know you know what you're talking about I see it happening I just cannot
[01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:42.420]  believe they're actually trying a leftist communist playbook destabilization
[01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:45.980]  overthrow but it appears ladies and gentlemen this is not a dry run this is
[01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:50.500]  not a beta test yeah it appears they're really looking to go we're on the march

[01:33:56.460 --> 01:34:01.900]  Trump and and obviously the National Enquirer and I mean this isn't a guy over
[01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:04.980]  here saying he's talking to the Trump people I don't we probably even get into
[01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:10.180]  this or when I have Colonel Smith Mac on who's exposing what base is shipping
[01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:16.020]  arms on a train to Mexico to be sent to Al Qaeda and ISIS you understand when
[01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:19.860]  they come on this show they get physically attacked you know a few days
[01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:24.980]  after or or they get death-threaded or the Justice Department calls up and
[01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:29.580]  threatens plumbly we're not up here saying hey we're tough guys we're up
[01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:33.580]  here saying this country's being taken down in front of everybody the public's
[01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:38.340]  in us trance and if we expose their plans to use an economic collapse and
[01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:41.700]  race war to bring in martial law as they pretty much already done in Europe
[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:46.100]  they may have to back off and then people say oh you're a fair monger it
[01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:51.140]  didn't happen oh like the NSA spying or the internet ID it's all going to happen
[01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:55.100]  if we don't stop them you understand it isn't like I'm sitting here going boy I
[01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:58.940]  hope all this happens so I'll be a superstar oh wonderful we ever get
[01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:02.160]  off one of the New World Order they'll say boy that Alex Jones is like Paul
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:05.460]  Revere with Matt Drudge and you know people like Larry Nichols boy in that
[01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:10.060]  great how's that help Larry Nichols kids or my kids or his grandkids this is a
[01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:17.700]  full fight people he's up here in Hillary's face she can't stand him it's
[01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:21.300]  come out in lawsuits before and in federal cases where the feds have got
[01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:25.540]  our emails and are watching what we're doing and stuff I mean believe me this
[01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:29.700]  is not games this isn't people acting like they're on the cutting edge isn't
[01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:32.780]  people acting like they're giving you the big breaking news this is people
[01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:36.980]  risking everything for this Republic we're back to Larry here in just a
[01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:41.860]  moment it's just I see a guy over here fighting for his life and fighting for
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:47.780]  his country's life and and gutting up to be on air you know with his surgery and
[01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:51.740]  all the rest of it and I just think about the average men that are strong
[01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:55.780]  they're smart that are tough that if their neighbor got in their face and
[01:35:55.780 --> 01:36:00.620]  slapped their wife you know this you know these men would stand up but when
[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:05.140]  the globalist conquer your country and rub your face in it and just dominate
[01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:09.300]  and and overthrow our nation and attack God and the family and everything else
[01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:14.380]  and unborn babies the average man just gets a glazed-looking design I want to
[01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:18.060]  ask Larry Nichols why is that maybe it's just they never thought of themselves
[01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:20.780]  as fighting tyranny or they don't respect themselves or it's like
[01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:26.780]  government's another world it runs things no it doesn't we're the people and
[01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:33.140]  it is this pliant attitude where you bend over to the new world listen the

[01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:45.540]  program it's running that we've seen other countries we know where point A to
[01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:51.140]  Z goes and let me tell you we're already down to life X and in the last few
[01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:56.420]  letters there'll be more change than you saw in all the other progression you'll

[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:17.240]  some of these other groups and the feds it go out and get these political
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:21.900]  subversives that are stirring up the left and you won't be fired the police go
[01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:25.220]  out and arrest the patriots at that point you'll be the next ones just know

[01:39:03.980 --> 01:39:08.260]  about 500 bucks this is normally 220 something it's a hundred and 80 what is
[01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:12.260]  184 dollars 86 dollars and put it back on screen I'm going for memory it's 25

[01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:29.660]  soul right because pointing that at God is the most important thing when when
[01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:34.100]  when Larry Nichols says get right with Jesus he means it folks I've gotten so
[01:41:34.100 --> 01:41:40.820]  much closer to God because I've studied this and I've seen evil and I know how
[01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:43.940]  real it is and I'm telling you folks if you're not right with God and you don't
[01:41:43.940 --> 01:41:47.220]  have God on your side and you're not asking God for protection and discernment
[01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:51.700]  and you're not asking God to help you meet other people who are looking for
[01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:56.460]  other good folks as well you're in for a lot of trouble because I've never got up
[01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:59.540]  on air and talked about stuff being this scary I'm always hoping we can push it
[01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:03.260]  back and change it and derail it or that's why I've gotten so much more
[01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:07.660]  hardcore and so much more risky with what I do I mean we've pulled out all the
[01:42:07.660 --> 01:42:10.980]  stops you're going up against the enemy just doing stuff that I know when I do
[01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:17.700]  it is sticking my head in the lion's mouth and I'm not talking about a train
[01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:22.820]  one that's at the at the circus so I'm doing what I got to do because if I
[01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:28.020]  don't I die inside but I just want you to understand something the fear you
[01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:34.260]  ought to have is not standing up to these people we got to recognize them as
[01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:39.500]  evil and make a clean break with them and just absolutely get in their face
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:44.940]  politically at every level and say you are anathema you are evil you stage
[01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:49.380]  things and blame it on us you hate us you want to bankrupt us you want to mount
[01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:53.940]  our heads on your walls figuratively and for real and we are setting our will
[01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:59.140]  our guts our spirit everything and against it and saying God we're all
[01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:03.900]  in and God then like wind in the sails will come in I'm telling that's how
[01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:06.620]  this works and it doesn't mean you won't be persecuted or go through some
[01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:11.220]  trouble but the enemy hates us because they don't even like us being around
[01:43:11.220 --> 01:43:16.220]  the psychopaths and sociopaths they're scared of us and they want to break our
[01:43:16.220 --> 01:43:20.060]  will and we have got to take action now Larry I've been running on to give you
[01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:22.980]  the floor now I apologize I'm not gonna take calls when we give you more time
[01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:27.500]  it's just this is such an epic time when just more stuff's happening in a week
[01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:35.780]  now than used to happen in a year and it's accelerating and I just now I mean I
[01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:39.940]  have a beyond a horrified feeling in my chest it's just I'm like where's the
[01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:45.140]  person to fight I'm like ready I just I know how sick these people are and
[01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:49.180]  every fiber of me is like desperately trying to find the lever the switch to
[01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:53.980]  throw to turn the tide and we're turning the tide at many levels is why
[01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:59.220]  they're accelerating so I want to get into Trump what you're working on and
[01:43:59.220 --> 01:44:04.380]  play some clips here Larry go ahead well what you're talking about Alex's
[01:44:04.380 --> 01:44:09.780]  Einstein did it he did take a string with a ball on the end of it say ten foot
[01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:14.940]  long spin that ball around now I want you to take that same ball cut that
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:20.020]  French string and half spinning around and the ball goes faster now you cut
[01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:25.580]  that string in half and it's zipping and the closer you get to your hand that
[01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:31.860]  ball is moving fast fast fast now you know he called the point at which the
[01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:38.860]  energy is initiated to spin that ball he called it the event and as the ball
[01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:45.940]  gets closer to the event other words as time gets closer to the event thing
[01:44:45.940 --> 01:44:52.820]  speed up exponentially we're seeing that right now Alex we're seeing it that's
[01:44:52.820 --> 01:45:01.580]  why today things seem to be developing faster than we can even imagine then
[01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:06.460]  there's another trick they have and they use this one almost every day this is
[01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:12.740]  where Hillary is so significant most people Alex have in their mind the
[01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:18.300]  level to which they will do something sinister and evil other words you Alex
[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:23.100]  in your mind if you sit down and said okay what is the worst thing I could do
[01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:30.420]  I mean being me evil sinister how far would I go and you've got a limit the
[01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:37.020]  Clintons use that I used to use it on people people have innately in a limit
[01:45:37.020 --> 01:45:44.540]  to how far they will go to be evil and to get what they want the Clintons have
[01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:49.140]  no limit and so we're sitting here you and I Alex we're trying to convince
[01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:53.540]  people you can't believe what these people will do because people don't
[01:45:53.540 --> 01:45:57.580]  believe anybody would do it that's why I'm saying people got to get aggressive
[01:45:57.580 --> 01:46:01.660]  focused and confident and really start thinking about your limits because
[01:46:01.660 --> 01:46:05.260]  there's the deal they're gonna push us folks if we don't start pushing back all
[01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:08.500]  the way to the limit where things get really nasty and that's what I'm
[01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:12.020]  saying Larry I've looked at the tea leaves here all the different evidences I
[01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:16.220]  think they've miscalculated and I and when they push us to the limit I think
[01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:22.340]  they're going to cause a chain of events that is gonna bring them down I mean
[01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:31.740]  I know you're right Alex I know you're right what we have to get your listeners
[01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:37.100]  our people over is everybody said you know you were saying a minute ago what
[01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:42.780]  about the average male you know when why won't he engage what what is it about
[01:46:42.780 --> 01:46:46.620]  him that somebody slaps his wife around course he'll engage but when it comes to
[01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:52.100]  this to the nation to the country to the future you know there's a big
[01:46:52.100 --> 01:47:00.180]  sits out there what can I do one man one man how could I change things well
[01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:05.540]  folks we gonna snap out of that and we the snap out of that fast or it's over
[01:47:05.540 --> 01:47:13.780]  for us now it does not Alex take every man woman and child in America to wake
[01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:21.340]  up and to resist these people the truth is Alex it takes less people to resist
[01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:29.940]  them than you think it's just we've got to have people that are willing to engage
[01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:35.860]  and get in the fight willing and and and willing is a breakdown of will that's
[01:47:35.860 --> 01:47:41.620]  right and when I say engage in the fight Alex everybody doesn't have to do like
[01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:46.380]  you they don't have to start a company risk their life get on the air and
[01:47:46.380 --> 01:47:52.820]  invest everything they have every day risk every time they have to be able to
[01:47:52.820 --> 01:47:56.100]  get the word out and to tell the truth they don't have to do that
[01:47:56.100 --> 01:48:01.820]  everybody has a place everybody has a role you know everybody's not a car
[01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:07.260]  mechanic everybody's not a brain surgeon we don't need everybody to be
[01:48:07.260 --> 01:48:14.060]  monolithic what we need is everybody bring to the party that which you do
[01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:19.660]  that's what our founding fathers did they said butchers bakers candlestick
[01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:26.180]  makers preachers let's all come and let's get in this thing and he did but
[01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:32.540]  remember folks please remember this revolutionary was not fault by every
[01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:36.660]  person that was in this country three percent four percent right less than
[01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:41.660]  four percent of the people in this country at that time actually participated
[01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:50.620]  and we won we can win today if we can get four percent of our population to
[01:48:50.620 --> 01:48:59.380]  engage now here's where it gets kinky we need everybody to unify under one
[01:48:59.380 --> 01:49:03.780]  let's say umbrella I guess that's what you call an umbrella where is that
[01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:08.340]  George Washington and that's the problem and they're worried about states
[01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:12.420]  coalescing and forming that that's why the entire Pentagon plan is to take out
[01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:16.140]  a states movement when they bring us under open globalism but the public has
[01:49:16.140 --> 01:49:20.460]  to be prepared in the information warfare realm in the battle space to
[01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:25.340]  recognize that global attempt to destroy the states is illegitimate and then
[01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:28.700]  just with political will none of us comply doesn't matter how many troops
[01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:33.900]  they put the streets plus the most awake group is the special forces community
[01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:39.060]  I mean I'm sure you know that no but let me tell you ask the question where is
[01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:44.300]  the George Washington I never believed Bill Clinton no much he ever said but
[01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:48.140]  there was one thing I heard him say one time when he was president that was
[01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:58.100]  actually true you know great moments and events create great men it might be
[01:49:58.100 --> 01:50:04.300]  Donald Trump Alex I say something else it might be you it might be I don't know
[01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:10.500]  we won't know until we engage one of the things that I was his victory this is
[01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:13.460]  so key what you're saying this is the absolute key to everything we don't know
[01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:17.340]  till we engage we engage we win we have the moral the high ground in history we
[01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:21.660]  lay down they win we cannot lose if we engage it doesn't mean we're gonna make
[01:50:21.660 --> 01:50:27.260]  it either folks that's right you know what happened when the allied forces
[01:50:27.260 --> 01:50:31.900]  crossed the Rhine into the Germany hey it got tough you know why because the
[01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:36.940]  Germans at that point we're fighting for their homeland folks we're fighting for

[01:54:19.100 --> 01:54:23.580]  clips and boy they're powerful Obama stumbling around bumbling around trying
[01:54:23.580 --> 01:54:28.020]  to tag him back kids being brainwashed white kids black kids Hispanic kids
[01:54:28.020 --> 01:54:32.420]  just kids to say horrible things about Trump that he's racist he said he hates
[01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:38.020]  Jews I'm Jewish I mean he didn't say he hates Jews or black people or Hispanics
[01:54:38.020 --> 01:54:47.100]  or anybody but again it just shows and his parents are in the background these
[01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:54.820]  clips are up on infowars.com going good they sound like snakes I just thank God
[01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:59.100]  I had parents that were involved and informed and studied history and my
[01:54:59.100 --> 01:55:02.620]  mom's got a degree in history and it's true people that don't know history and
[01:55:02.620 --> 01:55:07.540]  them to repeat it Larry Nichols was getting into the fact that they're
[01:55:07.540 --> 01:55:11.500]  getting us to a point of our backs being against the wall they've made it racial
[01:55:11.500 --> 01:55:14.860]  and I love the fact of the spite of the fact they said the Tea Party was racist
[01:55:14.860 --> 01:55:18.100]  that some Hispanics and black folks would come to it but now I'm seeing a lot
[01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:21.020]  of these rallies were half the folks are Hispanic it's incredible and huge
[01:55:21.020 --> 01:55:23.980]  numbers of black folks who really see through it and I mean are there gonna
[01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:28.820]  be some racist people at Trump rallies absolutely but I mean I'm a white guy
[01:55:28.820 --> 01:55:32.420]  believe me most white people I know are the opposite of racist they're self-loving
[01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:36.860]  okay I mean most people don't like themselves in this modern society you
[01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:39.820]  give them another reason they're gonna be into it there's a lot of self-hating
[01:55:39.820 --> 01:55:45.100]  going on no matter what color you are we're just people and he has such a unifying
[01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:48.780]  message but of sovereignty we need that they're killing that hey we got open
[01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:52.380]  borders hey they're bringing in radicals hey sure he's giving people red meat
[01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:55.860]  cuz that's the first thing people get hey my life's falling apart but I got to
[01:55:55.860 --> 01:56:00.580]  pay for all this so I was talking to Larry Nichols I want to keep him the
[01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:05.300]  next hour a little bit he can do it if he's probably got to go about solutions
[01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:10.580]  how do people get involved at first how do people take action at first what do
[01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:15.700]  they do there's a thousand ways to do it the biggest way in the information war
[01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:19.820]  is the internet to take our articles our videos our material stories this Larry
[01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:24.380]  Nichols video that's live right now and send it to people that's number one but
[01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:27.700]  number two run for office locally number three start a shooting club
[01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:31.580]  whatever it's all little things in the culture that will break the globalist
[01:56:31.580 --> 01:56:34.660]  back call and talk radio do your own YouTube channel I want to keep you a
[01:56:34.660 --> 01:56:37.780]  little bit if you got to go at least on the Trump stuff and what's about to roll
[01:56:37.780 --> 01:56:40.980]  out I don't know how much that was inside baseball or outside baseball because
[01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:45.020]  you were telling Nico he related but a lot of exciting stuff there and of
[01:56:45.020 --> 01:56:46.900]  course you would communicate directly to the Trump folks were saying through
[01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:51.060]  this platform not with them for reasons that are obvious but it's been a few
[01:56:51.060 --> 01:56:54.100]  minutes with us here on solutions how does somebody's never really been
[01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:58.420]  involved how do they get involved all right first off Alex I'm glad you asked
[01:56:58.420 --> 01:57:03.340]  me and guys there's a couple things I want to make very very clear you know
[01:57:03.340 --> 01:57:09.380]  Alex bless his heart ask you to help me I need it I'm not gonna say I don't I'm
[01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:16.980]  not gonna say what on earth I'm not saying I don't but I cannot my things do
[01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:20.100]  you hear that Alex your computer's going crazy it's okay but it's not coming
[01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:26.900]  across here well anyway what I want you to know is you don't have to do you don't
[01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:32.780]  have to send me money but here's what you better do you had better get on Alex's
[01:57:32.780 --> 01:57:38.580]  email list you've got to and I'm sorry y'all I don't know where that's coming
[01:57:38.580 --> 01:57:46.140]  from you better get on Alex's email list absolutely that's how we communicate
[01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:49.420]  with folks and yes it's for marketing to find ourselves as well but it is more
[01:57:49.420 --> 01:57:52.780]  important than ever I've never even used it for marketing till now to reach
[01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:55.980]  people with this censorship increasing now now Larry do you have another show
[01:57:55.980 --> 01:58:00.900]  come up do you have to go well I do but I'll look this is too important I can't
[01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:04.100]  stop at this point let's go I gotta go to break in one minute I want to come back
[01:58:04.100 --> 01:58:07.820]  and give me the floor for just five more on the Trump situation there's been new
[01:58:07.820 --> 01:58:12.940]  Trump development absolutely absolutely but one thing quickly get on the

[01:59:56.820 --> 02:00:26.660]  We're on the March. Global's Empire is failing forward. We are on the March. The Empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Larry Nichols is with us till 15
[02:00:26.660 --> 02:00:41.500]  minutes into this hour then he's got another interview he's doing. This guy is battling cancer if you're radio-less you can't see him there with the bandages on his throat from surgery and they've got it opened up so they can put a trach in when they need to and he's on oxygen and the guy's tough. And in the fictional world of breaking bad the guy cooks
[02:00:41.500 --> 02:01:01.500]  mathanphetamine to try to fund his cancer treatment with Larry Nichols. He just puts up a PayPal for folks to support him. We're going to put that up before he leaves us again. And then Joe Bay is going to join us from the social justice wars on the road. I'm going to open the phones up. And we also have David Knight haunchoing the fourth hour. Larry, I want to hit the Trump stuff when we come back in the next
[02:01:01.500 --> 02:01:18.500]  time because this one's short. But finishing up with solutions. If people just spread the word about this broadcast or other broadcasts are telling the truth. If people educate Congress. I mean there are a lot of good people we have to normalize reality we know reality
[02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:33.500]  scary we know it's sensational we know it's scary to talk about it but it is happening. And so we need to force this out in the open. But then what do we do after that point when they've got most of key positions filled with other criminals. And we know the government's
[02:01:33.500 --> 02:01:47.500]  criminal 6% of the public trust the media and AP poll scientific. What happens at that point where most of the military is awake a lot of the FBI is awake they're not all bad people Secret Service I know is awake. But the people on top are these horrible
[02:01:47.500 --> 02:02:04.500]  clowns like Hillary. What do we do about the stalemate or impasse. First thing you got to do Alex is what you did and what you and I did back when Bill Clinton. We have to set up an overall umbrella. All right. Now a lot of people are awake but the problem we have Alex is a lot of people
[02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:26.500]  have their pet peeve issues some people are against this some people are against this we got a unified under the one thing save this country forget all of the. The smaller issues get unified under one issue the big picture we got to save the country.
[02:02:26.500 --> 02:02:41.500]  Now once we do that once we come together we've got to identify ourselves Alex that's the problem we must identify ourselves that's why big people to get on your email is we've got to know how many people who we've got in our army.
[02:02:41.500 --> 02:03:01.500]  Now with that then we can attack and I mean attack the people that are in Washington the good ones. Yes we've got to give them the faith that there are enough people behind us to back them that they're not out there on the limb by themselves.
[02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:16.500]  And then we've got to be able to cut through the media and attack the Clintons and how do you do that that's where Donald Trump comes in Donald Trump is our great hope you see Trump.
[02:03:16.500 --> 02:03:35.500]  If he will keep doing what he's doing he gives us access Alex to the people going around the media. You know he talks straight to the people. The media tries to block him in every turn he don't care he just tweet your quidge or whatever he does he gets the word out.
[02:03:35.500 --> 02:03:48.500]  That's where we gather gather. That's what he's been able to do is a focal point and the fact that he's going with your research drug research our research and really put in the Clinton's face is absolutely terrifying them.
[02:03:48.500 --> 02:04:06.500]  Imagine this what happened Alex if if let's just imagine Trump getting up in a speech and he says you know they have said that the whole Vince Foster thing is solved there's nothing to it it's all put to bed what if in that speech he was given
[02:04:06.500 --> 02:04:26.500]  a secret service memo and he read it he said now there's this sound like it was solved him doing that would set the media on fire the whole world would know the whole thing will come back out again and just like the starting 28 pages that's all out now or starting to come out
[02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:47.500]  absolutely. So there are moves we have to remember Alex in any battle any military person you know we'll tell you there is strategic and tactical we must understand strategically what our goal is our goal folks is nothing but save our country
[02:04:47.500 --> 02:05:00.500]  and then tragically how do we do it. That's how we do it. Number one we stop Hillary. Number two we move to the only true thing that saves this nation and that is moving back to state right.
[02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:19.500]  Ladies and gentlemen teleprompter in chief I'm edited if we turn against each other based on divisions of race or religion if we if we fall for you know a bunch of
[02:05:19.500 --> 02:05:37.500]  okie doke just because it you know it nothing was a level on cat it sounds funny or the tweets are provocative yeah yeah yeah keep that mouth laughing and do no listening
[02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:51.500]  always trying to make Trump look bad but he won't be debating Trump. Hillary will. Well first of all they're just words she reads off a teleprompter you notice she's reading off a teleprompter she always does and she really doesn't have her own words.
[02:05:51.500 --> 02:06:10.500]  It should be fun for info wars.com. I'm David Knight introducing vitamin mineral fusion from info wars life.com we have worked for years with our chemist and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable great tasting

[02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:40.500]  In the history of info wars life we brought out a lot of amazing products like survival shield next to supermail vitality and so many others but I am most proud of the product we're now launching today with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:54.500]  This formula is the platinum standard of multi vitamin mineral products. The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard. That means it's clean. That means it's pure.
[02:06:54.500 --> 02:07:07.500]  That's info wars life.com and vitamin mineral fusion. Take action now before we sell out. But we tell us about Alexa pure breeze discounted over 25% off as an introductory promotion.
[02:07:07.500 --> 02:07:18.500]  It's the Alexa pure breeze. It's an energy efficient HEPA ion cluster air purification system. It has a four stage purification process. It has a HEPA filter pre filters and a carbon activated filters.
[02:07:18.500 --> 02:07:31.500]  And the most amazing thing about it is that it has this patented ion cluster technology that kills airborne microbes with a final byproduct of clean water. So this is non toxic. It's a beautiful unit. It really looks good.
[02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:41.500]  I mean, it will look beautiful in your house in the corner. The Alexa pure breeze, which operates as a fan. It's super quiet. The cheapest equivalent unit costs $259.95.
[02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:51.500]  And there are other units that are up to $899 to $1000 to do exactly what this unit does. But they're not as quiet because this one has a silent mode which runs at 16 decibels.
[02:07:51.500 --> 02:08:01.500]  Go and just look up online the toxicity of being inside all the time. Great job Alexa pure info or store.com. But we thank you so much, my friend.
[02:08:21.500 --> 02:08:41.500]  I'm kind of torn with some of those new liners that we've done because it sounds like we're at now in Las Vegas, Nevada of a big fight night.
[02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:48.500]  But the other side of it is no work. This is an epic battle. We need to have like horns going off sirens and air raid sirens.
[02:08:48.500 --> 02:09:01.500]  I mean, it is crazy that info wars is one of the most prominent organizations still promoting Americana basic free market due process live in a free country.
[02:09:01.500 --> 02:09:11.500]  And that we're just overrun with globalist propaganda and dumbing down. It is it is an amazing time to be alive.
[02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:18.500]  Larry Nichols leaves us here in a few minutes showbiz is coming on. I will get to all these Trump clips. I was trying to get a bunch of them this morning. They had them ready for showtime.
[02:09:18.500 --> 02:09:25.500]  And then I'm like, hurry up and get me that. And then I don't play for two hours. They need to slap me around sometimes, but it's epic what's going on.
[02:09:25.500 --> 02:09:39.500]  And remember America in the whole planet. Every form of insanity is intensifying in other areas because the globalist admittedly have been creating economic conditions that exacerbate that on record.
[02:09:39.500 --> 02:09:51.500]  So I want Larry Nichols here to impart to the audience again top Clinton insider formally basically handling the Clintons to a great extent when he was governor.
[02:09:51.500 --> 02:09:58.500]  And then it just got so corrupt he had to start fighting back. He was the main guy in the Clinton Chronicles and big news articles about it.
[02:09:58.500 --> 02:10:08.500]  One of the top people that was instrumental in getting information out through Drudge and David Shippers and others that finally got the impeachment of Clinton going.
[02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:17.500]  And even if it didn't finally convict him in the Senate, it punished him publicly and at least created the idea that you're not completely by the law.
[02:10:17.500 --> 02:10:31.500]  We're now in a climate I'd say three, four times worse where just the lawlessness, not just the email gate or the Benghazi or fast and furious or all this, it's just incredible that we've reached this point.
[02:10:31.500 --> 02:10:47.500]  So in the last few minutes, we haven't learned Nichols. You talked to Nico before the show today. I'd like to talk to you at the show if we can about how much of the Nichols Trump information we're allowed to talk about on air or where this is all going.
[02:10:47.500 --> 02:10:55.500]  I mean, I know you've wanted to reach out to Trump. You've said that on the videos. And I know that those folks have reached out to you. I don't know how far you want to go on that.
[02:10:55.500 --> 02:11:05.500]  But obviously you were saying you just want to impart the basic knowledge here publicly. And then, you know, hopefully Trump will then go the next step on Vince Foster, the next step on the rape.
[02:11:05.500 --> 02:11:11.500]  So try to reveal to the audience here who's on pins and needles about this. How much you can tell us Larry Nichols.
[02:11:11.500 --> 02:11:14.500]  Well, here's what I intend to do.
[02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:32.500]  And this will be up to Mr. Trump and what he does. Number one, if Donald Trump called me today, Alex, I would say to him, I would say, Mr. Trump, I support you, but I will not be an official part of your campaign in any way because if we got caught meeting together,
[02:11:32.500 --> 02:11:50.500]  they would roast you horribly because remember, they call me every kind of thing there is, they call him everything there is, and they would use both of us to discredit it. So therefore, what I would say to Mr. Trump is, I will go about every other week on Alex Jones,
[02:11:50.500 --> 02:12:00.500]  sure will come right here if you would allow me, and I will release a new scandal, a new piece of the puzzle.
[02:12:00.500 --> 02:12:14.500]  Now, once I do that, it would be very wise for Mr. Trump to pick it up like he did the Vince Foster thing, pick it up and talk about it.
[02:12:14.500 --> 02:12:23.500]  You see, if he won't talk about it, what we break here, it will draw people, Alex, here to hear more of this.
[02:12:23.500 --> 02:12:29.500]  Sure. Two months ago, you said Trump needs to go with Vince Foster. He did. So it's very exciting.
[02:12:29.500 --> 02:12:38.500]  Well, and remember the strategy for Vince Foster. Alex, as you and I have talked about since day one, we're not going to get here indicted over Vince Foster.
[02:12:38.500 --> 02:12:44.500]  We're not, but I tell you what we're going to do. I tell you what I'm going to do, and I hope you are in and I know you are.
[02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:55.500]  We're going to make piece by piece by piece the true story about Vince Foster, the greatest who done it in American history.
[02:12:55.500 --> 02:13:08.500]  People will get involved if they're entertained, Alex. If we try to tell them stuff and cram it down their throat in political times and historical times and all of that, they're not going to listen.
[02:13:08.500 --> 02:13:16.500]  But I tell you what, if we can entertain them, they'll buy into it. They'll learn. And you have to do it through repetition.
[02:13:16.500 --> 02:13:20.500]  So that's what I would say. I would say, Mr. Trump, just do me a favor.
[02:13:20.500 --> 02:13:30.500]  When I break something with Alex Jones, one thing that Alex makes me do anything I break, I have to be able to prove in a court of law, which I will be able to do.
[02:13:30.500 --> 02:13:36.500]  So therefore he will be safe with the subject matter and just let the people know it's out there.
[02:13:36.500 --> 02:13:45.500]  Now, if he does that, more people, Alex, outside of the outside of the moral Christian conservative community will come here.
[02:13:45.500 --> 02:13:54.500]  They'll come here to hear. And of course, when they come here, Alex, you know, I'm a one trick pony. I'm Clinton. That's what I do. That's who I am.
[02:13:54.500 --> 02:14:01.500]  I will stop Hillary. I've made that pledge to the American people and you just heard, I made it to her. I'm Clinton.
[02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:06.500]  But there's an awful lot of other stuff that needs to be put out to people.
[02:14:06.500 --> 02:14:14.500]  So if we can draw them here using this campaign, they're not going to get it in the media, but they can get it here. They're going to learn.
[02:14:14.500 --> 02:14:19.500]  And the tactic the media uses that I talked a lot about the first hour is they tell us what winners should do.
[02:14:19.500 --> 02:14:24.500]  They tell us what losing strategies are. And really, the strategies they give us are losing. They call them winnings.
[02:14:24.500 --> 02:14:30.500]  They say, oh, Trump's discredited. He talks about rape. Trump's discredited. He talks about murders from the nineties.
[02:14:30.500 --> 02:14:34.500]  And the media is so scared. And then he goes up to three points in every major poll.
[02:14:34.500 --> 02:14:37.500]  He needs to go even further. And he's starting to do that.
[02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:44.500]  And he's decided from what I've been seeing to really take the gloves off. Roger Stone, if you can get through all the bad weather,
[02:14:44.500 --> 02:14:50.500]  he's going to be here today in studio with us tomorrow and we're going to do some special reports over the weekend.
[02:14:50.500 --> 02:14:56.500]  But I tell you, they're scared of Donald Trump and it's because they've had a bossy on him forever. They got his phones tapped.
[02:14:56.500 --> 02:15:01.500]  He's not perfect. They just know he's pro America. He's not a crook. He's not a child molester like most of them.
[02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:06.500]  And so they hate his guts. He's not. He's never been part of their club. He's been his own guy.
[02:15:06.500 --> 02:15:13.500]  I mean, to a point of, you know, he runs his own show completely. And so they just can't stand it because he's not a combine guy.
[02:15:13.500 --> 02:15:16.500]  He's not a syndicate guy.
[02:15:16.500 --> 02:15:26.500]  Then the thing that I've got to count on you to do, Alex, you, you're going to have to help me convince Donald Trump
[02:15:26.500 --> 02:15:32.500]  that the true solution to solving America's woes, it states right.
[02:15:32.500 --> 02:15:34.500]  He needs to come out and talk about states rights.
[02:15:34.500 --> 02:15:36.500]  You bet strip that damn watch.
[02:15:36.500 --> 02:15:39.500]  That's what made America great was the checks and balances.
[02:15:39.500 --> 02:15:40.500]  Exactly.
[02:15:40.500 --> 02:15:42.500]  States rights made America great.
[02:15:42.500 --> 02:15:44.500]  You do that.
[02:15:44.500 --> 02:15:51.500]  If Trump will make a part of his platform, I'm talking about this legitimate platform, states rights.
[02:15:51.500 --> 02:15:55.500]  Don't worry about what they'll try to do to him on foreign affairs.
[02:15:55.500 --> 02:15:59.500]  Guys, we got no business in foreign affairs until we clean up this country.
[02:15:59.500 --> 02:16:01.500]  We can't solve our problems.
[02:16:01.500 --> 02:16:04.500]  Foreign affairs make a lot of sense. Don't start a war with Russia.
[02:16:04.500 --> 02:16:06.500]  Don't back ISIS and al-Qaeda.
[02:16:06.500 --> 02:16:11.500]  Yeah, just like his foreign affairs sounds good to me. Just don't get involved.
[02:16:11.500 --> 02:16:13.500]  So Alex, you know, we've got work to do.
[02:16:13.500 --> 02:16:16.500]  I'll tell you another thing. It's probably about time.
[02:16:16.500 --> 02:16:19.500]  I mean, if you would do it, you're welcome to do it.
[02:16:19.500 --> 02:16:24.500]  Come in here. I think it's about time we need to do another one of those videos that you do.
[02:16:24.500 --> 02:16:28.500]  Put up a video. Let's talk about what we say, the solution.
[02:16:28.500 --> 02:16:33.500]  Absolutely. In closing, Larry, I know you don't ask for this, but it's true.
[02:16:33.500 --> 02:16:35.500]  You're battling cancer. We want to keep you around as long as possible.
[02:16:35.500 --> 02:16:38.500]  Regardless, we weren't in this death battle. You got a lot of courage.
[02:16:38.500 --> 02:16:43.500]  Again, I am very, very, very excited to try to take on the Clintons head to head.
[02:16:43.500 --> 02:16:47.500]  That's what I was born to stand up against these people just like you were.
[02:16:47.500 --> 02:16:55.500]  And so I feel honored before God and country to not be a coward and to stand with men like yourself and Donald Trump and Matt Drudge and so many others.
[02:16:55.500 --> 02:17:02.500]  And of course, don't forget judicial watch and don't ever forget the folks doing it longer than anybody except you.
[02:17:02.500 --> 02:17:09.500]  And that'd be the Joseph Farrah over at WorldNet Daily. They even predate Drudge and myself.
[02:17:09.500 --> 02:17:19.500]  So we all need to fight together and the audience who all those years, little old ladies handing out copies of the Clinton Chronicles and myself putting on access TV in 1995.
[02:17:19.500 --> 02:17:28.500]  You know, that's the type of stuff we're talking about here. Larry Nichols, we're going to put on screen your PayPal, Nichols live at AOL.com to help him battle cancer.
[02:17:28.500 --> 02:17:35.500]  Now, I know you don't want to talk about this. You told me some stuff privately and I know you've, you know, been pretty close here a few times.
[02:17:35.500 --> 02:17:38.500]  But how are you doing?
[02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:50.500]  Yeah, I'll be all right. I'll be all right. I'll make it until just folks don't worry. I'll be here to stop Hillary. I'll be here to stop Hillary.
[02:17:50.500 --> 02:17:53.500]  So you have those feeding on this fight? Is it giving you strength to hang on?
[02:17:53.500 --> 02:18:01.500]  That's it. You know, let me tell you the one thing that you have to have, Alex, is I've learned a will to live and that's in combat.
[02:18:01.500 --> 02:18:08.500]  Anywhere I've seen guys shot up, you'd say they're going to die and they live. I've seen guys that look like me, that wound didn't even hurt them and they die.
[02:18:08.500 --> 02:18:16.500]  And what happens usually is their will to live. I've got a great purpose. It's a purpose bigger than myself and that's trying to save this country.
[02:18:16.500 --> 02:18:24.500]  It's selfish purpose for my grandbabies. Now, listen, another thing, Alex, that you said while I'm back is exactly true.
[02:18:24.500 --> 02:18:31.500]  Discernment, folks, you've got to start being responsible and you've got to learn to discern the truth.
[02:18:31.500 --> 02:18:37.500]  A true patriot seeks out the truth and then tells it, then passes it on.
[02:18:37.500 --> 02:18:42.500]  Be careful. Be careful just everything that pops up on that damn end.
[02:18:42.500 --> 02:18:49.500]  They feed out disinfo to clog everything so that when we're saying something true or they misrepresent what I say.
[02:18:49.500 --> 02:19:02.500]  Yeah, I mean, they're really deceptive. And you got to watch out with the Clintons because their masters at putting people out there that look like they're on your side and they'll feed a 10-bit or two of truth.
[02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:11.500]  Exactly. I mean, look, it's just like in warfare radar jamming. They just jam things with smoke and watch in fighting.
[02:19:11.500 --> 02:19:21.500]  Anybody that ever in fights and attacks other hosts for no reason is an operative. Glenn Beck always did that. So I took the high road and didn't until he's now basically falling.
[02:19:21.500 --> 02:19:24.500]  And I don't take any pleasure in that. It's very sad.
[02:19:24.500 --> 02:19:25.500]  Right.
[02:19:25.500 --> 02:19:28.500]  Because I'm not in competition with any of these guys. I'm trying to save this country.
[02:19:28.500 --> 02:19:35.500]  Alex, let me tell you about Glenn Beck. Glenn Beck had his opportunity and I give him credit for that 9-12.
[02:19:35.500 --> 02:19:43.500]  He helped establish the Tea Party to a great extent. But Glenn Beck made one mistake. He did not give people something to do.
[02:19:43.500 --> 02:19:48.500]  He told the province. He told the province. He did the history of the province. Great.
[02:19:48.500 --> 02:19:55.500]  He got them. He got the horses to the cough, but he would not show them how to drink.
[02:19:55.500 --> 02:20:00.500]  That's right, Brother Larry. We're praying for it. We'll be back with y'all bigs, breaking news and much Trump clips.
[02:20:00.500 --> 02:20:06.500]  Are you sneezing, coughing and aching? Do you have a sore throat, a fever or the sniffles?

[02:20:59.500 --> 02:21:08.500]  Hi, I'm 54 years of age and at Christmas time last year, a resident I take care of at work accidentally rolled over my right foot with his motorized scooter.
[02:21:08.500 --> 02:21:15.500]  I was back into a corner and he put it in reverse and did it again. The bones in my foot weren't actually broken, but damage was done.
[02:21:15.500 --> 02:21:20.500]  The remedy was to just let the foot heal on its own and this was expected to take many weeks.
[02:21:20.500 --> 02:21:27.500]  As a caregiver, I do a lot of walking and I was sort of okay when I was in motion. It's when I stopped to rest that I really felt the pain.
[02:21:27.500 --> 02:21:30.500]  The pain was there getting out of bed in the morning too.
[02:21:30.500 --> 02:21:41.500]  So I got on the One World Way a few weeks back and I just had to write this testimony. No more pain, nothing. I can only attribute this to the One World Way since I haven't introduced anything else into my life.
[02:21:41.500 --> 02:21:50.500]  It's product of the true God's sense. It gives me energy and did whatever magic this stuff does to heal my poor foot. I will take One World Way for life.

[02:23:22.500 --> 02:23:34.500]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year. Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River.
[02:23:34.500 --> 02:23:42.500]  I loved my dad. The boy was he's stubborn. He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years. His excuse? He simply couldn't afford it.
[02:23:42.500 --> 02:23:49.500]  He wasn't a rich man by any means. At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[02:23:49.500 --> 02:23:59.500]  Don't wait. Go to LibertyOnCall.org right now for not just your sake, but for the sake of your loved ones. Again, that's LibertyOnCall.org.
[02:24:20.500 --> 02:24:27.500]  Live it on the road or make us free and clean, wouldn't it?
[02:24:36.500 --> 02:24:42.500]  You heard Larry Nichols talk about how important with all internet censorship kicking off that we have emails to communicate with each other.
[02:24:42.500 --> 02:24:57.500]  I've never been a big email guy. I don't really use a lot of email and I've never really tried to sit there even in the golden age of email 20 years ago and tried to get folks to come sign up for free newsletters and all the rest of this.
[02:24:57.500 --> 02:25:04.500]  But we do send out key articles and videos every day and we do have a little promo specials and things where you save a lot of money.
[02:25:04.500 --> 02:25:14.500]  So if you buy our products, you should be signed up. But we don't spam you with ads. We mainly send you material.
[02:25:14.500 --> 02:25:23.500]  I'm more interested in getting the material out than the marketing. The marketing is the powder that funds the operation that projects the bullet down the barrel.
[02:25:23.500 --> 02:25:35.500]  That's where we're wanting to go. But for a whole group of reasons, we do need to have an email to be in contact with info warriors.
[02:25:35.500 --> 02:25:41.500]  Also, I just want to encourage everybody, this is a war. And I know you're doing a lot. I want to thank you for what you're doing.
[02:25:41.500 --> 02:25:54.500]  But the most important thing you can do temporarily on this planet, praying to God's most important and getting right with God is send our articles, our videos, our information that you think is the most informative
[02:25:54.500 --> 02:26:00.500]  that you judge to be the most pertinent out to everyone you know constantly.
[02:26:00.500 --> 02:26:05.500]  Facebook, Twitter, all the globalist platforms. We're in a war.
[02:26:05.500 --> 02:26:15.500]  Post my videos to your own YouTube channel or, you know, to your Facebook channel, whatever. I don't have enough crew to put our videos on every platform I wish we could.
[02:26:15.500 --> 02:26:20.500]  I'm trying to hire people so I can do that just to get the word out. I'm not complaining.
[02:26:20.500 --> 02:26:28.500]  I didn't even have a crew to send Michael Zimmerman out to the West Coast with Biggs. Now he's there.
[02:26:28.500 --> 02:26:35.500]  I think he's getting up at the airport right now. We don't, dude's got to go on vacation sometime with his family for a couple days before he goes to cover Bilderberg.
[02:26:35.500 --> 02:26:39.500]  You know, I don't have the crew and I'm not complaining. I just want to do more.
[02:26:39.500 --> 02:26:53.500]  And so help us get the word out, buy our products, spread the word, but also do things like proliferate the articles, the videos across the internet and just keep hammering it.
[02:26:53.500 --> 02:27:03.500]  I know you're doing that. And if you're listening to a local AM or FM station or watching a scene in Houston on, you know, cable TV where we're on there daily and nightly running 24 hours a day basically,
[02:27:03.500 --> 02:27:11.500]  support that affiliate, but also spread the word about that oasis of information.
[02:27:11.500 --> 02:27:19.500]  And hey, maybe my style is not good for you. Fine. We got all these other great reporters, all these great guests, all this research, all these special reports.
[02:27:19.500 --> 02:27:26.500]  I mean, we are a arsenal in defense of liberty. Now I'll be with us about 10 minutes in the next segment.
[02:27:26.500 --> 02:27:33.500]  And then I'm going to go to more of these clips I haven't gotten to and try to take some calls at 800-2599-231.
[02:27:33.500 --> 02:27:39.500]  800-2599-231, but we are at an epic point right now in civilization.
[02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:48.500]  When you watch what the globalists and the think tanks and the big foundations and the CIA have created at universities, that's not some leftist aberrant thing.
[02:27:48.500 --> 02:27:55.500]  That's what the elite wanted for America, dumb, hateful, anti-free speech, nasty people.
[02:27:55.500 --> 02:27:59.500]  And Joe Biggs has been in the middle of it now a few days, and the reinforcements are there.
[02:27:59.500 --> 02:28:03.500]  Zimmerman flew out there this morning. So great job, Joe Biggs.
[02:28:03.500 --> 02:28:08.500]  For a few minutes, tell us what you've witnessed and what's coming up tonight.
[02:28:08.500 --> 02:28:13.500]  Well, what we do is we have an update in the UCLA shooting. This guy apparently had a kill list.
[02:28:13.500 --> 02:28:18.500]  And ding, ding, ding, ding, same as last time in San Bernardino. They all came out and said the shooter was white.
[02:28:18.500 --> 02:28:24.500]  Comes to find out. In fact, he wasn't. And now they can't play the race card anymore, and you're not hearing as much about it.
[02:28:24.500 --> 02:28:28.500]  Oh, too bad. So the guy wasn't white, so they can't talk about it anymore. Too bad.
[02:28:28.500 --> 02:28:35.500]  Yeah, his name's Maynack Sarkar. He drove from Minnesota. He's linked to a murder of a woman in Minnesota.
[02:28:35.500 --> 02:28:39.500]  And they found a kill list at his home in Minnesota.
[02:28:39.500 --> 02:28:43.500]  And on that name was another professor that didn't get killed, luckily, at UCLA.
[02:28:43.500 --> 02:28:47.500]  So the one guy got killed, and then he turned the gun on himself and shot himself.
[02:28:47.500 --> 02:28:51.500]  Wow. I wonder what was out of the news, guys. Absolutely.
[02:28:51.500 --> 02:28:54.500]  Yeah, I'm sure. So it's not in the news now. We'll pull that article up in the next segment.
[02:28:54.500 --> 02:28:56.500]  Isn't that interesting, Joe?
[02:28:56.500 --> 02:29:01.500]  Yeah, I mean, it's always interesting that way. They always want to, you know, blame it on a white guy.
[02:29:01.500 --> 02:29:08.500]  And then once that white privilege isn't to blame for whatever's happening, then they kind of just go quiet and hush-hush it.
[02:29:08.500 --> 02:29:14.500]  Now, you're following the Social Justice Warriors as they shut free speech down around the state.
[02:29:14.500 --> 02:29:16.500]  What's coming up tonight?
[02:29:16.500 --> 02:29:21.500]  Tonight, Milo will be speaking at the UC Irvine campus at 7 p.m.
[02:29:21.500 --> 02:29:24.500]  I don't have the exact building location yet. They haven't given that to me.
[02:29:24.500 --> 02:29:26.500]  I usually give it a couple hours ahead of time.
[02:29:26.500 --> 02:29:30.500]  But that will be at 7 p.m. tonight, so I'll encourage everyone to come out.
[02:29:30.500 --> 02:29:36.500]  That is close to Costa Mesa. It's like right there, and we're expecting that to be a very intense night tonight.
[02:29:36.500 --> 02:29:38.500]  So I want to see everybody out there.
[02:29:38.500 --> 02:29:41.500]  Sure, for those that don't know, this is a Breitbart tech editor.
[02:29:41.500 --> 02:29:44.500]  And everywhere he goes, they just attack him.
[02:29:44.500 --> 02:29:47.500]  Well, anybody that doesn't support Mao Zedong gets attacked, but I'm serious.
[02:29:47.500 --> 02:29:49.500]  Google now supports Mao.
[02:29:49.500 --> 02:29:52.500]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.500 --> 02:30:07.500]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:22.500 --> 02:30:42.500]  And now experts are concerned that the cognitive functions lost might not come back even after stopping the medications.
[02:30:42.500 --> 02:30:51.500]  Now, the studies are not conclusive, but it does add more credence to the idea that in our overly medicated society, we are the long-term test subjects.
[02:30:51.500 --> 02:30:59.500]  Leigh-Anne McAdder reporting for infowars.com.

[02:32:58.500 --> 02:33:14.500]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:28.500 --> 02:33:49.500]  David Knight is going to be a fresh horse in the fourth hour coming into the fight.
[02:33:49.500 --> 02:33:55.500]  He'll be covering waterfront. Obviously, there's so much breaking. Let's put on screen since Joe Biggs mentioned this.
[02:33:55.500 --> 02:34:04.500]  He was broke about two hours ago, three hours ago, and he appears to be a gentleman of Indian descent that did the shooting yesterday and then committed suicide there.
[02:34:04.500 --> 02:34:09.500]  So that's one person he killed himself. We can back that out. I can give folks the headline.
[02:34:09.500 --> 02:34:26.500]  Well, UCLA shooting gunman Mr. Sarka had killed as police chiefs say. And there's no mention, was he a Christian, was he a Hindu, was he a Muslim? There's a mix of that in India, obviously.
[02:34:26.500 --> 02:34:34.500]  But it doesn't matter. Why is it always only important if they're white to make a big deal out of it?
[02:34:34.500 --> 02:34:39.500]  Now, you see, if someone's a Muslim and does it because they say it's part of a jihad, then that's a terror attack.
[02:34:39.500 --> 02:34:49.500]  Or if the feds stage a terror attack or criminal cell inside the feds stage a terror attack and blame it on the patriot movement, then they say it's a white domestic terrorism.
[02:34:49.500 --> 02:34:56.500]  Because it's a white guy, even though McVeigh said he didn't do it for white nationalist reasons.
[02:34:56.500 --> 02:35:04.500]  And the Southern Poverty Law Center was running the Elohim City compound of white supremacists. So that's what's really going on there.
[02:35:04.500 --> 02:35:11.500]  But to me, the big news is EU proposes government ID to use internet.
[02:35:11.500 --> 02:35:22.500]  And the way the EU bureaucracy works, I have it right here. This is given to the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee on the Regions.
[02:35:22.500 --> 02:35:27.500]  And then those committees decide parliament is ceremonial, but it says parliament.
[02:35:27.500 --> 02:35:36.500]  Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee, and the Committee of the Regions.
[02:35:36.500 --> 02:35:43.500]  And you read it, man. It is taxing the web, tracking you, deciding what websites can be up, going after hate speech.
[02:35:43.500 --> 02:35:48.500]  And inside the EU, there are resting people from Sweden to Germany who mildly criticize.
[02:35:48.500 --> 02:35:58.500]  In Germany, this Iraqi been arrested twice, robbing stores, walking around in a pajama outfit.
[02:35:58.500 --> 02:36:02.500]  Obviously mentally ill. There's the third time the police wouldn't come.
[02:36:02.500 --> 02:36:08.500]  So guys come in and restraining, taken to the cops, and they're saying they're now going to, they're looking at indicting them.
[02:36:08.500 --> 02:36:13.500]  That story is up on infowars.com. The quote vigilantes.
[02:36:13.500 --> 02:36:20.500]  Because it's so lawless. In some towns, they'll have like 100 people in the town. They bring 700 plus quote migrants.
[02:36:20.500 --> 02:36:25.500]  And grandmothers call their grandsons to protect them and the police arrest them. They're like, no.
[02:36:25.500 --> 02:36:31.500]  I mean, I mean, and then they have the Arabs on TV that speak German going, the whites need to die.
[02:36:31.500 --> 02:36:36.500]  And the Germans go, yes. I mean, this is how sick the liberals are, folks.
[02:36:36.500 --> 02:36:41.500]  And the Muslims are just looking around going, really, really? You're scum. I hate you. You like that?
[02:36:41.500 --> 02:36:46.500]  Yes. Good job. You hate me.
[02:36:46.500 --> 02:36:50.500]  I mean, and now the Germans that aren't completely mentally ill are being arrested.
[02:36:50.500 --> 02:36:54.500]  So this all ties together where Joe Biggs goes to these events.
[02:36:54.500 --> 02:36:59.500]  Any conservative speaks anywhere. In fact, I ought to pull these stunts just to show how first time it's under attack.
[02:36:59.500 --> 02:37:03.500]  I get invited to universities all the time and just say, no, because I'm too busy.
[02:37:03.500 --> 02:37:07.500]  You know, I can only reach a few thousand people there instead of reaching millions every day on the air.
[02:37:07.500 --> 02:37:12.500]  It's not that I'm arrogant and don't want to go. But wait a minute, I can go to these two.
[02:37:12.500 --> 02:37:17.500]  That's smart. That's what Breitbart, before he died, originally would do, was show how crazy and hateful they were.
[02:37:17.500 --> 02:37:20.500]  But now they just say, openly, we're going to shut you down. We're going to shut you up.
[02:37:20.500 --> 02:37:25.500]  So this all dovetails together, Joe. I don't know if you've seen the site today. You've been busy.
[02:37:25.500 --> 02:37:29.500]  I know you're traveling right now to pick up Zimmerman, your cameraman.
[02:37:29.500 --> 02:37:34.500]  But this is pretty incredible with this EU commission. What do you think?
[02:37:34.500 --> 02:37:42.500]  You haven't had a chance to see all that yet, but talk about where you're just mentioning a second ago about these social justice warriors.
[02:37:42.500 --> 02:37:47.500]  The interesting thing is, is whenever I go to these events, I always ask them, you know, why don't you like Trump?
[02:37:47.500 --> 02:37:52.500]  Or why don't you like, you know, Milo or whoever, you know, and they go, well, Trump's a racist.
[02:37:52.500 --> 02:37:57.500]  He wants to build a wall. Meanwhile, they're telling me this as they're linked together in a human chain,
[02:37:57.500 --> 02:38:01.500]  creating a wall, stopping people from going in to a free speech event.
[02:38:01.500 --> 02:38:10.500]  They just find it hilarious that they think walls are racist, but they create a wall to keep people out from an event where they can actually learn something.
[02:38:10.500 --> 02:38:16.500]  Now, Joe, obviously, your viral videos are on infowars.com. They're on the YouTube page.
[02:38:16.500 --> 02:38:20.500]  We premiere a lot of them on the nightly news this evening. You've been to a couple of these now.
[02:38:20.500 --> 02:38:24.500]  It seems like they're progressively getting more insane.
[02:38:24.500 --> 02:38:32.500]  You were also telling us how the police have been somewhat, in some cases, supportive of these people trying to violate the free speech.
[02:38:32.500 --> 02:38:39.500]  Yeah, they were really, really relaxed when it came to the protesters and more aggressive this time towards us.
[02:38:39.500 --> 02:38:44.500]  You know, at UCLA, you know, whenever we would say, hey, can you get some of these people out of here?
[02:38:44.500 --> 02:38:48.500]  Not me, but the, you know, the people that were running the event, hey, can you get some of these guys out of here?
[02:38:48.500 --> 02:38:50.500]  They're disrupting everything. They were like, no.
[02:38:50.500 --> 02:38:56.500]  But then they would allow those protesters to, like, bump into people and then claim to be assaulted.
[02:38:56.500 --> 02:39:00.500]  I mean, it was just completely and totally ridiculous. But I mean, that's coming for you.
[02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:06.500]  I mean, for example, last night I went out and I ran into a guy that made that, you know, you saw that shirt that says, Hillary on it?
[02:39:06.500 --> 02:39:07.500]  Yes.
[02:39:07.500 --> 02:39:10.500]  And I said, hey, can you do have one on you? I don't have a shirt.
[02:39:10.500 --> 02:39:13.500]  And he goes, yeah, let's go to my truck. So we, there was three of us.
[02:39:13.500 --> 02:39:18.500]  And one guy had a shirt on, had a picture of Obama and it said, A-hole.
[02:39:18.500 --> 02:39:21.500]  Another one had a picture of Hillary that said Hillary.
[02:39:21.500 --> 02:39:24.500]  And another one had a picture of Hillary that has a word, rhymes with bunch.
[02:39:24.500 --> 02:39:27.500]  And I said, let's go into this place and see if we can trigger some people.
[02:39:27.500 --> 02:39:33.500]  Hour goes by, no one says anything. And then this big fat guy comes up to me and he goes, can I get a picture with you?
[02:39:33.500 --> 02:39:38.500]  And I go, yeah. And then he walks off and he goes, you effing asshole, screw you, Hillary's a goddess, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:39:38.500 --> 02:39:40.500]  And I was like, oh, here we go.
[02:39:40.500 --> 02:39:47.500]  And the owner kicked us out of the bar because our shirts were hate speech and they could not have hate speech.
[02:39:47.500 --> 02:39:51.500]  Okay. Okay. I've been able to follow the news breaking an info war so fast while I've been on air today.
[02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:55.500]  I've been trying to track it. Do we have footage of this? This is golden.
[02:39:55.500 --> 02:39:59.500]  No, no, I didn't, my phone had just died. It was like later on in the evening.
[02:39:59.500 --> 02:40:03.500]  And that's when the idea popped in my head to go do this. So I'm going to try it again tonight.
[02:40:03.500 --> 02:40:08.500]  When we go out, we're going to wear the same shirt and then I'm going to have Zimmerman with us as well to be able to film it.
[02:40:08.500 --> 02:40:12.500]  Good. Let's, let's, let's, let's recreate this show.
[02:40:12.500 --> 02:40:17.500]  People with anti-Hillary shirts not allowed and given service. I mean, that's what this is about.
[02:40:17.500 --> 02:40:22.500]  It's where this is headed. But I'm sure that if you're wearing a gay shirt, it'd be all right.
[02:40:22.500 --> 02:40:26.500]  And of course, you know, or, or you just go set them up and, you know, put fag on the cake.
[02:40:26.500 --> 02:40:30.500]  And that's what they do. But I'm not saying you should do that.
[02:40:30.500 --> 02:40:35.500]  It was, I've never been so just like shocked my entire life.
[02:40:35.500 --> 02:40:38.500]  Like the music stopped. Like there was an Irish band. It was an Irish club.
[02:40:38.500 --> 02:40:44.500]  The music stopped as this bouncer and the owner of this Irish club comes up to me and he goes, he goes, screw your free speech.
[02:40:44.500 --> 02:40:49.500]  He comes safe. He's like, you can't have a strip like this. It's offensive. It's hate speech. Get your hate speech out of here.
[02:40:49.500 --> 02:40:52.500]  And I'm sitting there like, dude, you're out of your effing mom.
[02:40:52.500 --> 02:40:56.500]  Man, I wish you had that on. Oh, please go back. Wow. We need more of that.
[02:40:56.500 --> 02:41:01.500]  I'm going back to the exact, I'm going back to the exact same spot tonight and I'm going to see if that happens again.
[02:41:01.500 --> 02:41:04.500]  The same three people wearing the same shirt doing it all over again.
[02:41:04.500 --> 02:41:10.500]  Good. Good. Well, great job, Joe. Get Zimmerman, get back on the road.
[02:41:10.500 --> 02:41:13.500]  How many more days are you going to be there? A couple more?
[02:41:13.500 --> 02:41:19.500]  Right now, this is the last event for Milo, but we're scheduled to leave tomorrow, but if anything pops up, I mean,
[02:41:19.500 --> 02:41:24.500]  Hey, you want to, hey, student groups tweet at Alex Jones on Twitter or at Rambo Biggs on Twitter.
[02:41:24.500 --> 02:41:32.500]  If you want your student group to host Joe Biggs, we've already gone and done this in Portland because they tried to ban six Trump supporters from being able to have an event.
[02:41:32.500 --> 02:41:40.500]  So we show up the next weekend. Let's have Joe Biggs go out and do a tour with a few other folks and the Hitlery shirt.
[02:41:40.500 --> 02:41:44.500]  And this is the lady that said, you know, she went to Libya, came and saw and she killed, she's a warmonger.
[02:41:44.500 --> 02:41:49.500]  I think we can, you know, she said blacks are predators and need to be made to heal.
[02:41:49.500 --> 02:41:54.500]  So I think we can call her Hitlery, but regardless whether the speech is true or not, you have a right.
[02:41:54.500 --> 02:41:57.500]  And I think we should have a Hillary for prison event. I mean, that's it.
[02:41:57.500 --> 02:42:05.500]  We should have a Hillary for prison college tour and you can wear the Hillary for prison, the Hitlery guy can wear his shirt.
[02:42:05.500 --> 02:42:10.500]  And we can sit there and really show folks what's going on, because that's how we illustrate what these folks are up to.
[02:42:10.500 --> 02:42:16.500]  We should have a rally on the sidewalk outside this, this, this guy's bar who wants to get rid of our free speech.
[02:42:16.500 --> 02:42:19.500]  Joe Biggs will be following what you do, my friend.
[02:42:19.500 --> 02:42:21.500]  Roger that. Thank you, sir for having me on.
[02:42:21.500 --> 02:42:22.500]  Thank you.
[02:42:22.500 --> 02:42:28.500]  Wow. I tell you, okay, I have all these clips and I'm only playing a couple of them today. So let's start with the clips.
[02:42:28.500 --> 02:42:30.500]  I mentioned this in the first hour.
[02:42:30.500 --> 02:42:37.500]  What Donald Trump is doing, not just saying, oh, crooked Hillary and laughing, but saying these people are crooked.
[02:42:37.500 --> 02:42:42.500]  They're putting out this info on me. She works for crooks. These are criminals.
[02:42:42.500 --> 02:42:47.500]  This will bring them down, ladies and gentlemen, because they are criminals and if he takes the gloves off, it's over.
[02:42:47.500 --> 02:42:51.500]  And Trump knows they're going to come after him regardless with made up stuff.
[02:42:51.500 --> 02:42:56.500]  His only chance he's got is to hit him with everything he's got and to not hold back.
[02:42:56.500 --> 02:43:04.500]  In fact, if I have any problem with Trump as he's not going far enough, let's play this clip of him talking about how there are crooks this morning. Here it is.
[02:43:04.500 --> 02:43:14.500]  Listen to this one. Hillary Clinton, when she was Secretary of State, ran up $1 trillion in trade deficits with China.
[02:43:14.500 --> 02:43:19.500]  $1 trillion. Great job, Hillary. Hillary, a great job, Hillary. You're doing a great job.
[02:43:19.500 --> 02:43:28.500]  Crooked Hillary, crooked, crooked Hillary. She is a crooked person. See, they are being nice.
[02:43:28.500 --> 02:43:35.500]  At the same time, Secretary Clinton was surrendering our jobs to China.
[02:43:35.500 --> 02:43:47.500]  The Chinese government and its supporters were funneling huge sums, I mean, huge sums of money to bill Clinton so that he gives speeches.
[02:43:47.500 --> 02:43:54.500]  So she's giving China all these deals and China is paying him vast amounts of money to make speeches. Great job.
[02:43:54.500 --> 02:44:01.500]  Great job. I'm sure they never discussed it. I'm sure they had nothing. I'm sure it was just a coincidence. Folks, folks, what are you going to get?
[02:44:01.500 --> 02:44:08.500]  These are crooked people. These are crooked people. They've been crooked from the beginning. They were crooked with white water.
[02:44:08.500 --> 02:44:16.500]  They've been crooked from the beginning. You look at that foundation. It's pure theft and pure crookedness.
[02:44:16.500 --> 02:44:23.500]  Read the book. The book is unbelievable. In fact, now they just came out with a movie. It's coming out, like, very soon.
[02:44:23.500 --> 02:44:32.500]  But read the book. These are crooked people. We don't need another four years of Clinton, believe me. We don't need it.
[02:44:32.500 --> 02:44:42.500]  That folks is powerful. And it went on and on and on. And I needed to watch that because I kind of got upset in the first hour.
[02:44:42.500 --> 02:44:49.500]  And it's been a powerful show, but I should be more optimistic because when you attack these criminals and really hit them head on,
[02:44:49.500 --> 02:44:54.500]  they melt like a witch having a big bucket of water thrown on them.
[02:44:54.500 --> 02:44:58.500]  I'm melding. I'm melding. Oh, what a world. What a world.
[02:44:58.500 --> 02:45:07.500]  I mean, it's a joke that this leering, jack-o-lantern face joker woman with a big rubber head with all the dead people behind her
[02:45:07.500 --> 02:45:14.500]  just running around with a bunch of dumbed-down people they're going to vote for because she's a woman.
[02:45:14.500 --> 02:45:24.500]  I mean, the gimmicks are just incredible. And there's Donald Trump ready to take the gloves off even more.
[02:45:24.500 --> 02:45:30.500]  He is going to tear them to pieces. I got an even bigger clip coming up in the next segment.
[02:45:30.500 --> 02:45:37.500]  There's so many of these clips. I'm sure David will do a better job than I did in the fourth hour. Make sure. I know he's watching. Please, David. It's like 15, 20 clips.
[02:45:37.500 --> 02:45:44.500]  I mean, this is amazing. In fact, Nico Acosta, you do such a great job along with everybody else. You've got to make me get to these clips.
[02:45:44.500 --> 02:45:51.500]  I know you try to get me to. It's just that this is amazing. Most of these clips are on InfoWars.com.
[02:45:51.500 --> 02:45:56.500]  I mean, look at this one. Obama blames right-wing radio for making people think big government is the problem.
[02:45:56.500 --> 02:46:04.500]  And he talks about how government's giving us jobs and that, no, government takes people's money and redistributes it.
[02:46:04.500 --> 02:46:10.500]  And it picks winners and losers. And we want a limited government.
[02:46:10.500 --> 02:46:19.500]  And then we've got this. I'm going to play this one. Obama tries to trash Donald Trump and turns into a stuttering mess.
[02:46:19.500 --> 02:46:28.500]  And I just love the piece David Knight did. Maybe he'll air that in the fourth hour. The piece he did for radio.
[02:46:28.500 --> 02:46:33.500]  And for the radio feed, we like to get rid of commercials and just put information in them most of the time.
[02:46:33.500 --> 02:46:38.500]  We're trying to make the ads interesting again. People don't even listen to ads, as everybody knows.
[02:46:38.500 --> 02:46:44.500]  Well, we're actually bringing folks back to the ad because we're inserting vignettes of truth in there and information warfare.
[02:46:44.500 --> 02:46:56.500]  But this is Obama at a commencement speech. I mean, Drudge had the headline up there with just the video as the top story of him bumbling around like a complete moron. Here it is.
[02:46:56.500 --> 02:47:14.500]  That's because, you know, it sounds funny or the tweets are provocative. Then we're not going to build on the progress that we started.
[02:47:14.500 --> 02:47:23.500]  Yeah, that's not even the gold one, guys. That's not the one. That's not the clip I saw on Drudge or it's only a piece of it.
[02:47:23.500 --> 02:47:29.500]  Do you guys have the one? Here it is.
[02:47:29.500 --> 02:47:56.500]  Based on divisions of race or religion, if we fall for, you know, a bunch of okey-doke, just because, you know, it sounds funnier.
[02:47:56.500 --> 02:48:01.500]  Tweets are provocative. They're dear in the headlights right now.
[02:48:01.500 --> 02:48:05.500]  Then we're not going to build on the progress that we started.
[02:48:05.500 --> 02:48:12.500]  The progress you started. And then there's even a longer one online of him.
[02:48:12.500 --> 02:48:19.500]  Because they don't know what to do. They've thrown all their lies out there. All their exaggerations. All the twisting, and it's not working.
[02:48:19.500 --> 02:48:23.140]  and people know that these folks are crooks.
[02:48:23.140 --> 02:48:28.140]  All they've got is maybe 30% of the population
[02:48:28.420 --> 02:48:31.300]  that is helpless and doesn't know how to get a job
[02:48:31.300 --> 02:48:33.180]  and doesn't know how to wipe their own noses
[02:48:33.180 --> 02:48:35.540]  and can't find their rear room in both hands.
[02:48:35.540 --> 02:48:38.340]  A bunch of sniveling social justice warriors.
[02:48:38.340 --> 02:48:40.300]  And he talks about Trump spewing race.
[02:48:40.300 --> 02:48:44.100]  Trump's countering this orgy of anti-American,
[02:48:44.100 --> 02:48:49.100]  anti-white, anti-Christian, anti-just prosperity craziness.
[02:48:50.580 --> 02:48:51.960]  Total divide and conquer.
[02:48:53.060 --> 02:48:56.260]  There's a really powerful super cut here of Donald Trump.
[02:48:56.260 --> 02:48:57.620]  Top seven reasons why Hillary Clinton
[02:48:57.620 --> 02:48:59.540]  should never be elected.
[02:48:59.540 --> 02:49:00.980]  But let me tell you, he's starting to go there
[02:49:00.980 --> 02:49:02.100]  and I've been saying it for weeks.
[02:49:02.100 --> 02:49:05.540]  Trump go after them on the morale and Hughes deal
[02:49:05.540 --> 02:49:07.300]  when Hillary signed off with Bill
[02:49:07.300 --> 02:49:11.140]  to allow the missile secrets from top to bottom
[02:49:11.140 --> 02:49:12.780]  to get a rocket off the ground,
[02:49:12.780 --> 02:49:14.820]  to get it into orbit, to get it back into orbit
[02:49:14.820 --> 02:49:16.860]  and to have the nose cone come off
[02:49:16.860 --> 02:49:21.860]  and you got 12 to 24 individual rockets
[02:49:22.020 --> 02:49:25.740]  with hydrogen bombs on the end of them
[02:49:25.740 --> 02:49:27.460]  targeting certain cities.
[02:49:27.460 --> 02:49:30.420]  So say one comes in for Texas, nose cone pops off,
[02:49:30.420 --> 02:49:33.660]  it's got 24 missiles, only half of them actually have warheads,
[02:49:33.660 --> 02:49:35.220]  the others are decoys,
[02:49:35.220 --> 02:49:37.220]  and then they all sector in
[02:49:37.220 --> 02:49:39.620]  on their pre-targeted position and fire.
[02:49:39.620 --> 02:49:44.620]  That's what they did to us.
[02:49:45.420 --> 02:49:47.220]  And if Trump goes there, it's over.
[02:49:48.220 --> 02:49:49.060]  They're doing a good job.
[02:49:49.060 --> 02:49:51.740]  They're saying plug Alex, plug, plug, absolutely.
[02:49:51.740 --> 02:49:53.260]  Look, we got the best products out there.
[02:49:53.260 --> 02:49:55.380]  We've gone out and scoured to find you the very best products
[02:49:55.380 --> 02:49:58.460]  where it's non-GMO seeds or nutraceutical vitamins
[02:49:58.460 --> 02:50:00.780]  and supplements or shortwave radios
[02:50:00.780 --> 02:50:03.300]  or solar powered or solar powered systems
[02:50:03.300 --> 02:50:06.980]  that are so amazing that we have an info or store.com.
[02:50:06.980 --> 02:50:11.060]  We now have 25% off, introductory offer of the revolutionary,
[02:50:11.060 --> 02:50:13.980]  Alexa Pure Breeze air filter system
[02:50:13.980 --> 02:50:15.900]  that is just over the top amazing
[02:50:15.900 --> 02:50:18.420]  and is half the price of the leading competitors
[02:50:18.420 --> 02:50:20.900]  and just as good inside by side studies.
[02:50:20.900 --> 02:50:22.780]  And that's because prices are going down on these.
[02:50:22.780 --> 02:50:23.620]  Thank God.
[02:50:23.620 --> 02:50:26.100]  Something like this used to be like 800, 900, $1,000.
[02:50:26.100 --> 02:50:27.940]  I paid $1,000 a couple of years ago
[02:50:27.940 --> 02:50:30.060]  for systems that are as good as this.
[02:50:31.060 --> 02:50:36.060]  It is $184 right now, 25, essentially 26% off
[02:50:36.060 --> 02:50:39.180]  out of the gates and it's a, what a four filter system.
[02:50:39.180 --> 02:50:41.060]  Totally game changer.

[02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:51.940]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:50:51.940 --> 02:50:55.100]  And please, please spread our articles and videos.
[02:50:55.100 --> 02:50:56.660]  They're trying to censor us.
[02:50:56.660 --> 02:50:58.620]  They're coming in for everybody's free speech right now.
[02:50:58.620 --> 02:51:00.180]  Use it or lose it.
[02:51:00.180 --> 02:51:03.100]  Here's Dr. Paul Meyer, Christian psychiatrist,
[02:51:03.100 --> 02:51:06.700]  author of 85 books and founder of the national chain,
[02:51:06.700 --> 02:51:08.900]  Meyer Clinics, to tell you about
[02:51:08.900 --> 02:51:10.540]  to your health liquid vitamins.
[02:51:10.540 --> 02:51:13.500]  I've been taking these every day for over a decade now.
[02:51:13.500 --> 02:51:15.980]  And I try to encourage every one of my clients
[02:51:15.980 --> 02:51:17.060]  to take them every day.
[02:51:17.060 --> 02:51:18.100]  And there's a number of reasons.
[02:51:18.100 --> 02:51:20.380]  First of all, it's the best vitamins you can get.
[02:51:20.380 --> 02:51:23.060]  It's got dozens of vitamins, antioxidants, nutrients in it.
[02:51:23.060 --> 02:51:25.180]  And then the most important reason why I do it
[02:51:25.180 --> 02:51:27.780]  as a psychiatrist and recommend it to my patients
[02:51:27.780 --> 02:51:29.540]  is because it's got brain food in it.
[02:51:29.540 --> 02:51:31.380]  It's got the essential amino acid.
[02:51:31.380 --> 02:51:33.740]  It's got trypsin, philolamine, tyrosine,
[02:51:33.740 --> 02:51:35.140]  and choline, vitamin B6.
[02:51:35.140 --> 02:51:37.820]  And these chemicals that are all natural from food
[02:51:37.820 --> 02:51:40.060]  turn into the brain chemicals that make you happy.

[02:53:57.100 --> 02:54:00.060]  Current returns not indicative of future results.
[02:54:00.060 --> 02:54:26.420]  MUSIC
[02:54:26.420 --> 02:54:28.700]  You know, I know I gave the phone number out earlier
[02:54:28.700 --> 02:54:30.780]  and I haven't gone to your calls 20 minutes ago.
[02:54:30.780 --> 02:54:33.660]  So I'm going to try to jam a few calls in
[02:54:33.660 --> 02:54:36.540]  at the start of the next segment.
[02:54:36.540 --> 02:54:40.140]  Folks want to talk about a lot of issues that are taking place.
[02:54:40.140 --> 02:54:43.340]  But I tell you, a social justice warrior from California
[02:54:43.340 --> 02:54:44.460]  says they disagree with everything,
[02:54:44.460 --> 02:54:45.820]  so I'm going to go to them first.
[02:54:45.820 --> 02:54:47.900]  And I might co-host a little bit into the next hour
[02:54:47.900 --> 02:54:51.260]  to finish these calls with David Knight.
[02:54:51.260 --> 02:54:53.500]  It tired me out, though, this morning
[02:54:53.500 --> 02:54:57.780]  to read over this EU document
[02:54:57.780 --> 02:54:59.620]  and actually see how horrible it is.
[02:54:59.620 --> 02:55:01.540]  I mean, it's not like, oh, gosh, this is horrible.
[02:55:01.540 --> 02:55:03.100]  This will discredit these people.
[02:55:03.100 --> 02:55:04.180]  I'll be proven right again.
[02:55:04.180 --> 02:55:06.820]  I'm like, oh, oh, they're actually
[02:55:06.820 --> 02:55:08.260]  going to have internet ID and tax it,
[02:55:08.260 --> 02:55:09.460]  shut down free speech.
[02:55:09.460 --> 02:55:11.140]  They're already doing it.
[02:55:11.140 --> 02:55:13.260]  And there's almost no uproar.
[02:55:13.260 --> 02:55:15.220]  I mean, I am getting chills right now.
[02:55:15.220 --> 02:55:18.580]  I am really freaked out.
[02:55:18.580 --> 02:55:19.700]  And we need to be freaked out.
[02:55:19.700 --> 02:55:21.260]  That's normal, folks.
[02:55:21.260 --> 02:55:23.260]  This is horrible.
[02:55:23.260 --> 02:55:27.180]  Everybody else lives under tyranny in history.
[02:55:27.180 --> 02:55:30.020]  If you don't stand up, it's like not
[02:55:30.020 --> 02:55:32.460]  having a door on a submarine.
[02:55:32.460 --> 02:55:33.340]  It's going to flood.
[02:55:36.340 --> 02:55:37.860]  The social justice warriors feel like they're
[02:55:37.860 --> 02:55:38.780]  part of the establishment.
[02:55:38.780 --> 02:55:41.020]  I'm going to go to social justice warrior in just a moment.
[02:55:41.020 --> 02:55:43.060]  But first, I've got to play this because it's too important.
[02:55:43.060 --> 02:55:45.620]  Here's this war criminal Hillary about to give her new foreign policy
[02:55:45.620 --> 02:55:48.140]  speech and the news is covering lecturing everyone
[02:55:48.140 --> 02:55:51.820]  when she says she failed in Libya and all these places.
[02:55:51.820 --> 02:55:53.860]  No, they wanted to make it a failed state.
[02:55:53.860 --> 02:55:56.340]  That's war crime.
[02:55:56.340 --> 02:55:58.820]  She's a horrible mass murderer.
[02:55:58.820 --> 02:56:01.500]  And she wants to say that Donald Trump's a bad guy.
[02:56:01.500 --> 02:56:03.740]  So here's Donald Trump responding.
[02:56:07.780 --> 02:56:09.940]  Yeah, it's the seven points.
[02:56:09.940 --> 02:56:11.660]  Donald Trump, I said we went to break.
[02:56:11.660 --> 02:56:13.580]  Top seven reasons why Hillary Clinton should never
[02:56:13.580 --> 02:56:14.540]  be elected president.
[02:56:14.540 --> 02:56:16.420]  Here it is.
[02:56:16.420 --> 02:56:19.780]  She's not qualified because she has bad judgment.
[02:56:19.780 --> 02:56:21.100]  Now, who said that?
[02:56:21.100 --> 02:56:23.180]  Bernie Sanders said it about Hillary.
[02:56:23.180 --> 02:56:25.220]  She's not qualified.
[02:56:25.220 --> 02:56:27.820]  So here are seven points that I walked down, which
[02:56:27.820 --> 02:56:29.180]  I think are important.
[02:56:29.180 --> 02:56:32.500]  And they talk about Hillary and her incompetence.
[02:56:32.500 --> 02:56:35.220]  She's one of the worst secretaries of state
[02:56:35.220 --> 02:56:38.020]  in the history of our country.
[02:56:38.020 --> 02:56:40.180]  Now she wants to be a president.
[02:56:40.180 --> 02:56:42.260]  Look, I'll be honest.
[02:56:42.260 --> 02:56:45.660]  She has no natural talents to be president.
[02:56:45.660 --> 02:56:47.340]  This is not a president.
[02:56:47.340 --> 02:56:48.380]  They talk about me.
[02:56:48.380 --> 02:56:51.260]  Actually, a lot of people think I look extremely presidential.
[02:56:51.260 --> 02:56:52.700]  You want to know the truth.
[02:56:52.700 --> 02:56:59.260]  But do you really believe that Hillary is presidential?
[02:56:59.260 --> 02:57:02.500]  This is not presidential material.
[02:57:02.500 --> 02:57:06.260]  Her Libya invasion, the Libya invasion, was disgusting.
[02:57:06.260 --> 02:57:08.020]  I mean, you know who has the oil?
[02:57:08.020 --> 02:57:10.100]  ISIS has the oil from Libya.
[02:57:10.100 --> 02:57:11.140]  We went in.
[02:57:11.140 --> 02:57:13.060]  We knocked the hell out of Libya.
[02:57:13.060 --> 02:57:16.420]  We did all of the things with Gaddafi and all the while
[02:57:16.420 --> 02:57:17.340]  we did great.
[02:57:17.340 --> 02:57:18.780]  She ends up with Benghazi.
[02:57:18.780 --> 02:57:22.220]  Remember the famous phone call at 3 o'clock in the morning?
[02:57:22.220 --> 02:57:23.260]  She'll answer the call.
[02:57:23.260 --> 02:57:24.180]  Guess what?
[02:57:24.180 --> 02:57:25.940]  She was sleeping.
[02:57:25.940 --> 02:57:27.860]  She was sleeping like a baby.
[02:57:27.860 --> 02:57:28.820]  Don't wake me up.
[02:57:28.820 --> 02:57:29.660]  She was quarterbacking.
[02:57:29.660 --> 02:57:32.660]  Of course, she took the calls from her slimy friends.
[02:57:32.660 --> 02:57:36.060]  But she didn't take five to 600 calls.
[02:57:36.060 --> 02:57:38.180]  They were calling and calling.
[02:57:38.180 --> 02:57:39.380]  And she was sleeping.
[02:57:39.380 --> 02:57:41.100]  And she did that phony commercial.
[02:57:41.100 --> 02:57:42.220]  Remember that?
[02:57:42.220 --> 02:57:44.020]  That phony commercial.
[02:57:44.020 --> 02:57:46.500]  If the phone rings at 3 o'clock in the morning,
[02:57:46.500 --> 02:57:48.860]  well, it did ring a lot of times.
[02:57:48.860 --> 02:57:52.060]  And she was sleeping.
[02:57:52.060 --> 02:57:55.980]  Maybe it's no energy, low energy, right?
[02:57:55.980 --> 02:57:57.620]  She needed her sleep.
[02:57:57.620 --> 02:57:58.860]  She needed her sleep.
[02:57:58.860 --> 02:58:02.540]  So her Libyan invasion, decisions on Syria, Iraq,
[02:58:02.540 --> 02:58:05.740]  and Iran have made the Middle East more dangerous than ever,
[02:58:05.740 --> 02:58:06.900]  ever before.
[02:58:06.900 --> 02:58:08.140]  And you know that.
[02:58:08.140 --> 02:58:08.860]  Let's hit pause.
[02:58:08.860 --> 02:58:11.260]  That's only one or two of the points of the seven.
[02:58:11.260 --> 02:58:13.740]  But I've got to go to your calls to want to come back.
[02:58:13.740 --> 02:58:14.980]  Some stations don't care the fourth hour.
[02:58:14.980 --> 02:58:16.460]  A lot of stations are picking it up.
[02:58:16.460 --> 02:58:18.060]  Want to thank those affiliates for doing that.
[02:58:18.060 --> 02:58:19.500]  We have round table discussions.
[02:58:19.500 --> 02:58:23.700]  We have David Knight, Paul Watson, Jakari Jackson, Rob Dube,
[02:58:23.700 --> 02:58:25.500]  and so many other great reporters,
[02:58:25.500 --> 02:58:27.780]  like Anthony Uchiarty and his countless others that
[02:58:27.780 --> 02:58:28.500]  hosted.
[02:58:28.500 --> 02:58:29.700]  That is coming up.
[02:58:29.700 --> 02:58:31.820]  The fourth hour of your station doesn't carry it.
[02:58:31.820 --> 02:58:36.860]  Infowars.com forward slash show to find all the free feeds.
[02:58:36.860 --> 02:58:38.900]  Please send that link out to everyone.
[02:58:38.900 --> 02:58:39.980]  This is a war.
[02:58:39.980 --> 02:58:42.940]  We need your help.
[02:58:42.940 --> 02:58:46.780]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:46.780 --> 02:58:47.280]  Yeah.
[02:58:47.280 --> 02:58:48.700]  And Watson's doing a big Reddit thing tonight.
[02:58:48.700 --> 02:58:50.140]  That's on the site.
[02:58:50.140 --> 02:58:52.940]  Buckley, tell us about Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:58:52.940 --> 02:58:57.700]  This counted over 25% off as an introductory promotion.
[02:58:57.700 --> 02:58:58.980]  It's the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:58:58.980 --> 02:59:02.380]  It's an energy efficient HEPA ion cluster air purification
[02:59:02.380 --> 02:59:03.100]  system.
[02:59:03.100 --> 02:59:05.620]  It has a four stage purification process.
[02:59:05.620 --> 02:59:07.540]  It has a HEPA filter, pre filters,
[02:59:07.540 --> 02:59:09.180]  and a carbon activated filters.
[02:59:09.180 --> 02:59:10.780]  And the most amazing thing about it
[02:59:10.780 --> 02:59:13.940]  is it has this patented ion cluster technology
[02:59:13.940 --> 02:59:16.660]  that kills airborne microbes with a final byproduct
[02:59:16.660 --> 02:59:17.660]  of clean water.
[02:59:17.660 --> 02:59:19.460]  So this is non-toxic.
[02:59:19.460 --> 02:59:20.820]  It's a beautiful unit.
[02:59:20.820 --> 02:59:21.740]  It really looks good.
[02:59:21.740 --> 02:59:24.020]  I mean, it will look beautiful in your house in a corner.
[02:59:24.020 --> 02:59:27.460]  The Alexa Pure Breeze, which operates as a fan.
[02:59:27.460 --> 02:59:28.500]  It's super quiet.
[02:59:28.500 --> 02:59:31.580]  The cheapest equivalent unit costs $259.95.
[02:59:31.580 --> 02:59:34.580]  And there are other units that are up to $899 to $1,000
[02:59:34.580 --> 02:59:36.260]  to do exactly what this unit does.
[02:59:36.260 --> 02:59:38.620]  But they're not as quiet because this one
[02:59:38.620 --> 02:59:41.620]  has a silent mode, which runs at 16 decibels.
[02:59:41.620 --> 02:59:43.940]  Go and just look up online the toxicity of being
[02:59:43.940 --> 02:59:45.060]  inside all the time.
[02:59:45.060 --> 02:59:46.300]  Great job, Alexa Pure.
[02:59:46.300 --> 02:59:49.060]  Infowarsstore.com, Bucky, thank you so much, my friend.
[02:59:52.660 --> 02:59:55.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:55.300 --> 02:59:57.120]  Hello.
[03:00:25.300 --> 03:00:30.940]  I don't want to be in your British hell.
[03:00:30.940 --> 03:00:35.300]  I don't want to be in your new water hell.
[03:00:35.300 --> 03:00:40.700]  Look at the EU Commission, Merkel threatening the UK not to leave.
[03:00:40.700 --> 03:00:49.060]  Merkel warns UK of isolation if Bricsett, Brics exit camp wins vote.
[03:00:49.060 --> 03:00:52.980]  Talk about walking corpses, unholy living dead.
[03:00:52.980 --> 03:00:57.460]  Hillary is this low energy goblin zombie and you look at her followers, I mean I'm sorry.
[03:00:57.460 --> 03:01:02.740]  I don't care what color they are, they look like a bunch of reanimated dead people.
[03:01:02.740 --> 03:01:05.620]  David Knight's coming up to haunch of the rest of the broadcast, the next segment I'll
[03:01:05.620 --> 03:01:09.020]  take calls, I'm gonna stay with him and go for a while.
[03:01:09.020 --> 03:01:13.520]  I did a two hour workout yesterday, I did like an hour one this morning and it just
[03:01:13.520 --> 03:01:14.820]  killed me.
[03:01:14.820 --> 03:01:17.820]  And so when I'm low energy and struggling, I'm just gonna keep going, that's the answer.
[03:01:17.820 --> 03:01:20.420]  Just keep going until you find the other side of that.
[03:01:20.420 --> 03:01:24.260]  My low energy days are most people's high energy days, that's kind of bad for folks
[03:01:24.260 --> 03:01:27.980]  coming around me all day though, but stealth laws, attack, privacy and travel, that's coming
[03:01:27.980 --> 03:01:28.980]  up.
[03:01:28.980 --> 03:01:34.940]  It's Facebook become a black hat hacker, absolutely, newly disclosed, CDC bio lab failures, likely
[03:01:34.940 --> 03:01:39.700]  a screenplay for disaster movie, autonomous cars, smart highways and the road to serfdom,
[03:01:39.700 --> 03:01:45.100]  La Raza, groomed by globalist, we're gonna get to all this coming up.
[03:01:45.100 --> 03:01:50.380]  But the big thing is the attack on free speech with the EU Commission that's unelected announcing
[03:01:50.380 --> 03:01:57.700]  what it's gonna do, but let's talk to social justice warrior, that's SJW from California
[03:01:57.700 --> 03:02:00.740]  to hear what they have to say, I'm told I disagree with everything.
[03:02:00.740 --> 03:02:03.380]  So go ahead, are you able to talk, can you talk?
[03:02:03.380 --> 03:02:09.500]  Let's see if we can have a cogent conversation without you making ad hominid attacks.
[03:02:09.500 --> 03:02:13.980]  There is no way you're a social justice warrior, you're actually able to talk, is this a fake
[03:02:13.980 --> 03:02:16.380]  phone call?
[03:02:16.380 --> 03:02:19.660]  We're already starting with your ad hominid attack.
[03:02:19.660 --> 03:02:24.540]  Okay, we're not in debate class brother, Hilary gave the messengers for communist Chinese,
[03:02:24.540 --> 03:02:27.860]  okay, you support a trader, go ahead.
[03:02:27.860 --> 03:02:36.500]  Stop Alex, stop Alex, let me sound real smart, go ahead, tell me how to calculate the cabbage.
[03:02:36.500 --> 03:02:42.780]  I'm really honestly gonna ask you a question, if you can stop talking for 25 seconds, I
[03:02:42.780 --> 03:02:45.740]  will send you $500.
[03:02:45.740 --> 03:02:48.500]  Go ahead, let's see what you have to say.
[03:02:48.500 --> 03:02:55.220]  Start the clock Alex, you know Alex, one thing I've got to say to you is that you are part
[03:02:55.220 --> 03:03:01.020]  of the problem, not part of the solution, clearly you have gotten into bed with Fox
[03:03:01.020 --> 03:03:05.900]  News and Tucker Carlson and the Dolls from camp and the Larry Nichols and the snake
[03:03:05.900 --> 03:03:10.060]  oil sales that you do, it's clearly an operation.
[03:03:10.060 --> 03:03:14.500]  What I'd like to ask you is Alex, who are you really working for?
[03:03:14.500 --> 03:03:18.500]  Because you're clearly not working for the people.
[03:03:18.500 --> 03:03:19.500]  Is that your 25 seconds?
[03:03:19.500 --> 03:03:23.220]  We've got a couple seconds left.
[03:03:23.220 --> 03:03:28.740]  You talk about ad hominem attacks, you're not getting into politics or issues or any
[03:03:28.740 --> 03:03:34.100]  of it, there are a lot of people in a controlled media climate like Tucker Carlson who would
[03:03:34.100 --> 03:03:40.340]  get fired if he came out against the globalist over the years and I've steadily seen him
[03:03:40.340 --> 03:03:45.020]  get better so I want to win a war and I've had dinner with him and know him personally
[03:03:45.020 --> 03:03:50.380]  and he's a patriot and he's done as much as he could and he's getting better as liberty
[03:03:50.380 --> 03:03:52.020]  rises.
[03:03:52.020 --> 03:03:59.060]  I have had Fox News offer me a multiple TV shows, multiple television programs, asked
[03:03:59.060 --> 03:04:04.820]  Mankal Muller and refused and they couldn't believe it that I would not take them.
[03:04:04.820 --> 03:04:11.060]  So that's a fact, they want me to fly every weekend to New York and tape a show that'd
[03:04:11.060 --> 03:04:12.060]  be on Sunday.
[03:04:12.060 --> 03:04:13.060]  No way.
[03:04:13.060 --> 03:04:16.020]  Now they were here in Austin and I could say what I wanted, yeah I'd be on Fox News
[03:04:16.020 --> 03:04:21.420]  and I'd make the point that Fox is changing, we've won, you know, we've taken over.
[03:04:21.420 --> 03:04:27.300]  So I'm going to hold you over because I want to flesh this out with you because we're
[03:04:27.300 --> 03:04:31.340]  going under world government, the EU is trying to censor people's speech, all this stuff's
[03:04:31.340 --> 03:04:33.940]  happening and you make it about Alex Jones.
[03:04:33.940 --> 03:04:34.940]  Who am I oppressing?
[03:04:34.940 --> 03:04:38.620]  Who am I going after other than the classic leftist attack?
[03:04:38.620 --> 03:04:42.220]  I'm surprised you're throwing the Koch brothers but now because they're opening it's Trump
[03:04:42.220 --> 03:04:46.900]  you can't say that so, oh he works for the Koch brothers, really I haven't seen one red
[03:04:46.900 --> 03:04:49.300]  cent from these people.
[03:04:49.300 --> 03:04:55.620]  So it's just all the pseudo-intellectual little bag of tricks, oh I've thrown in with the,
[03:04:55.620 --> 03:05:00.620]  I've thrown in with the Bill of Rights buster, we'll be back.
[03:05:00.620 --> 03:05:04.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, teleprompter and chief unedited.
[03:05:04.780 --> 03:05:17.100]  If we turn against each other based on divisions of race or religion, if we fall for, you know,
[03:05:17.100 --> 03:05:30.540]  a bunch of okie-dokie, just because, you know, it, it, it, it, it sounds funny, funny, funny,
[03:05:30.540 --> 03:05:32.900]  funny, hang in there, the tweets are provocative.
[03:05:32.900 --> 03:05:38.000]  Yes, yes, yes, yes, keep that in mind, laughin' and be rolling and you know what I mean.
[03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:41.300]  Well, he's trying to make Trump look bad but he won't be debating Trump.
[03:05:41.300 --> 03:05:42.300]  Hillary will.
[03:05:42.300 --> 03:05:46.380]  Well, first of all, they're just words, she reads off a teleprompter, you know that she's
[03:05:46.380 --> 03:05:51.760]  reading off a teleprompter, she always does, and she really doesn't have her own words.
[03:05:51.760 --> 03:05:53.420]  It should be fun.
[03:05:53.420 --> 03:05:56.540]  Professor Wars.com I'm David Knight.
[03:05:56.540 --> 03:05:58.220]  Hey everyone!
[03:05:58.220 --> 03:06:03.940]  Hey everyone, Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side, and as many of you know,
[03:06:03.940 --> 03:06:06.980]  I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[03:06:06.980 --> 03:06:10.640]  You've all heard the shocking statistics, despite spending trillions of dollars in health
[03:06:10.640 --> 03:06:14.780]  care nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country.
[03:06:14.780 --> 03:06:19.340]  Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:06:19.340 --> 03:06:22.620]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone
[03:06:22.620 --> 03:06:25.220]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:06:25.220 --> 03:06:28.460]  If you are dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain
[03:06:28.460 --> 03:06:32.420]  your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate

[03:06:55.940 --> 03:07:23.140]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from InfowarsLife.com.
[03:07:23.140 --> 03:07:27.540]  In the history of InfowarsLife, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival
[03:07:27.540 --> 03:07:30.980]  Shield X2, SuperMell Vitality, and so many others.
[03:07:30.980 --> 03:07:35.860]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today, with its unique delivery
[03:07:35.860 --> 03:07:40.660]  system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[03:07:40.660 --> 03:07:45.020]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[03:07:45.020 --> 03:07:50.460]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest
[03:07:50.460 --> 03:07:52.180]  quality lab standard.
[03:07:52.180 --> 03:07:53.620]  That means it's clean.
[03:07:53.620 --> 03:07:54.620]  That means it's pure.
[03:07:54.620 --> 03:07:57.700]  That's InfowarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:07:57.700 --> 03:08:25.500]  We'll catch you now before we sell out.
[03:08:25.500 --> 03:08:33.060]  I'm not gay, and I'm not vicarious, and I'm not attracted to men, but I am attracted
[03:08:33.060 --> 03:08:34.580]  to George Strait's voice.
[03:08:34.580 --> 03:08:39.620]  I would marry George Strait's voice, just to have it in a bottle and be like, I'm joking.
[03:08:39.620 --> 03:08:42.260]  It's a joke, but I do love George Strait.
[03:08:42.260 --> 03:08:45.820]  We're going to have fun with that in the tabloids.
[03:08:45.820 --> 03:08:47.700]  Let's hear a little bit more of George Strait.
[03:08:47.700 --> 03:08:51.700]  That rises my soul.
[03:08:51.700 --> 03:09:15.060]  You know my daughter, older daughter, she heard that like 6, 7, 8 years ago when she
[03:09:15.060 --> 03:09:16.060]  was little.
[03:09:16.060 --> 03:09:19.740]  She goes, she'd already been reading and she'd read some article in Texas Monthly about
[03:09:19.740 --> 03:09:20.740]  George Strait.
[03:09:20.740 --> 03:09:22.620]  He's sold more than the Beatles.
[03:09:22.620 --> 03:09:25.980]  What do you mean he doesn't have a dime, but what he's got is mine.
[03:09:25.980 --> 03:09:28.940]  And I said, sweetheart, he didn't write that song.
[03:09:28.940 --> 03:09:32.780]  It's about a rodeo or a San Antonio who doesn't have anything.
[03:09:32.780 --> 03:09:36.260]  And so that's not George Strait talking, but George Strait would probably tell you that
[03:09:36.260 --> 03:09:38.340]  all he's got is being an honorable, good person.
[03:09:38.340 --> 03:09:41.660]  I know folks that know George Strait, they say he's as good as it gets.
[03:09:41.660 --> 03:09:43.860]  And I could kick myself on time.
[03:09:43.860 --> 03:09:47.420]  I was invited to a birthday party that Ace in the Hole was playing at, and I didn't go.
[03:09:47.420 --> 03:09:49.020]  It's like 100 people.
[03:09:49.020 --> 03:09:50.860]  George Strait was there for two hours.
[03:09:50.860 --> 03:09:55.460]  I'm not a stalker, but I tell you, I really wanted to kick myself in the butt over that
[03:09:55.460 --> 03:09:56.460]  one.
[03:09:56.460 --> 03:10:00.060]  Okay, enough fanboy stuff about George Strait, but he does just live in between Austin and
[03:10:00.060 --> 03:10:01.060]  San Antonio.
[03:10:01.060 --> 03:10:03.900]  He's got a ranch out there and his family ranch south of, south of Austin.
[03:10:03.900 --> 03:10:08.900]  The great part is he really comes from a ranching family the whole nine yards and his pure Americana.
[03:10:08.900 --> 03:10:09.900]  But you know what?
[03:10:09.900 --> 03:10:12.020]  I don't have a dime, but what I got is mine.
[03:10:12.020 --> 03:10:13.500]  I've got some money.
[03:10:13.500 --> 03:10:16.540]  I've got some money saved trying to run this operation for a while if they pulled everything
[03:10:16.540 --> 03:10:17.540]  out on this.
[03:10:17.540 --> 03:10:21.060]  I've got a backup, not much of one.
[03:10:21.060 --> 03:10:26.060]  But I was telling it means I don't have a dime, but what I got is mine.
[03:10:26.060 --> 03:10:30.020]  All we have is our freedoms and our integrity and our ancestors and our children.
[03:10:30.020 --> 03:10:33.700]  And we're being robbed of that and being turned into a bunch of zombies.
[03:10:33.700 --> 03:10:34.700]  And that's what makes me angry.
[03:10:34.700 --> 03:10:39.540]  And I was talking to a social justice warrior who's a rare, you know, if I just cared about
[03:10:39.540 --> 03:10:43.380]  ratings, because all I like to do is warn folks about the New World Order and kind of
[03:10:43.380 --> 03:10:46.380]  act like a honking goose half the time, repeating some of the same stuff.
[03:10:46.380 --> 03:10:51.380]  And I apologize because the technocracy, the eugenicist, at the end of the day, what really
[03:10:51.380 --> 03:10:56.620]  matters other than the master plan, hey, the folks running things are out to get us and
[03:10:56.620 --> 03:10:58.380]  are really evil.
[03:10:58.380 --> 03:11:02.860]  And here they are and let's do dossiers on each one, which we've done from Soros right
[03:11:02.860 --> 03:11:08.100]  down the line.
[03:11:08.100 --> 03:11:10.780]  Then it doesn't matter what they're doing grassroots or how they spin it.
[03:11:10.780 --> 03:11:13.900]  You know somebody is evil who's in control.
[03:11:13.900 --> 03:11:18.780]  The devil is at the wheel.
[03:11:18.780 --> 03:11:20.940]  That's what I'm getting at.
[03:11:20.940 --> 03:11:22.500]  And I really believe in freedom.
[03:11:22.500 --> 03:11:26.700]  I really believe in private property and family and the Second Amendment, the right to follow
[03:11:26.700 --> 03:11:28.300]  whatever religion you want or not to.
[03:11:28.300 --> 03:11:30.100]  I'm a liberal.
[03:11:30.100 --> 03:11:31.980]  I'm a Thomas Jefferson lover.
[03:11:31.980 --> 03:11:35.060]  Again, I'm not gay, but I would marry the Bill of Rights.
[03:11:35.060 --> 03:11:36.900]  Is the Bill of Rights male though?
[03:11:36.900 --> 03:11:40.500]  All right, I'm going to stop that joke.
[03:11:40.500 --> 03:11:41.660]  It's crazy.
[03:11:41.660 --> 03:11:48.540]  It's crazy to sit here and to know I'm genuine and to know I'm honorable and to know I'm
[03:11:48.540 --> 03:11:52.860]  true and to see the mainstream media, the globalists, the attack dogs, all of them,
[03:11:52.860 --> 03:11:57.140]  all they ever try to do is to say, I'm a fraud when I was on the BBC, like three, four years
[03:11:57.140 --> 03:12:00.180]  ago on their big Sunday morning show, biggest show in the country.
[03:12:00.180 --> 03:12:01.180]  I forget the name of it.
[03:12:01.180 --> 03:12:04.300]  It's what the big morning show is with the top host.
[03:12:04.300 --> 03:12:09.420]  And there was a member of Bilderberg at the meeting coming in next and I blow up at him
[03:12:09.420 --> 03:12:10.420]  and say, they're sitting the game.
[03:12:10.420 --> 03:12:11.420]  It's not a joke.
[03:12:11.420 --> 03:12:12.420]  It's crazy.
[03:12:12.420 --> 03:12:16.820]  We go to break.
[03:12:16.820 --> 03:12:18.060]  They go, okay, get you leave.
[03:12:18.060 --> 03:12:19.820]  I stopped yelling.
[03:12:19.820 --> 03:12:21.140]  They got security guards.
[03:12:21.140 --> 03:12:24.660]  They're about to grab me and I walk out nicely.
[03:12:24.660 --> 03:12:27.940]  They go on air and they say, well, then I've videotaped the Bilderberg guy actually and
[03:12:27.940 --> 03:12:30.100]  have a conversation, but that was a minute later.
[03:12:30.100 --> 03:12:31.100]  Sorry.
[03:12:31.100 --> 03:12:32.100]  He was coming out of the bathroom.
[03:12:32.100 --> 03:12:33.100]  You saw it on YouTube.
[03:12:33.100 --> 03:12:35.020]  So I started taping as soon as I left.
[03:12:35.020 --> 03:12:40.140]  In fact, thank God he went on air and lied like three minutes later after break and said
[03:12:40.140 --> 03:12:41.780]  that I had announced it's all fake.
[03:12:41.780 --> 03:12:42.780]  I don't mean any of this.
[03:12:42.780 --> 03:12:43.780]  I'm a fraud.
[03:12:43.780 --> 03:12:50.980]  Well, I started recording actually during the show.
[03:12:50.980 --> 03:12:51.980]  That's right.
[03:12:51.980 --> 03:12:52.980]  So I was still going.
[03:12:52.980 --> 03:12:57.260]  So we put that clip up on YouTube where you actually see me get up, then in my face, I
[03:12:57.260 --> 03:12:58.260]  leave.
[03:12:58.260 --> 03:13:02.460]  The Bilderberg guys coming in, we get that on tape.
[03:13:02.460 --> 03:13:06.380]  I talked about this yesterday, how I tape these encounters so they can't set me up.
[03:13:06.380 --> 03:13:07.620]  And that's what they did with Katie Couric.
[03:13:07.620 --> 03:13:11.220]  So she couldn't set them up, see, people don't, we now know they're evil.
[03:13:11.220 --> 03:13:14.980]  We now don't just lay there and let the wolves attack.
[03:13:14.980 --> 03:13:19.420]  And once you get that mindset, it's game over, we'll kick their butt all day.
[03:13:19.420 --> 03:13:24.820]  And he got up on TV and he said, Alex Jones just said to us, he's a liar and he's a fake
[03:13:24.820 --> 03:13:27.260]  and doesn't mean any of it.
[03:13:27.260 --> 03:13:30.860]  And even the right wing guy that was attacking me on there claiming, you know, because I
[03:13:30.860 --> 03:13:36.860]  don't want all these wars and I'm this big liberal, that was their attack over there.
[03:13:36.860 --> 03:13:38.340]  He wouldn't agree with the guy.
[03:13:38.340 --> 03:13:39.340]  He's like, isn't that true?
[03:13:39.340 --> 03:13:45.940]  The host said, the guy was like, and that's what they do.
[03:13:45.940 --> 03:13:47.660]  They say, you're not real.
[03:13:47.660 --> 03:13:54.220]  They call into doubt, hoping you're stupid, hoping that when they say Donald Trump said
[03:13:54.220 --> 03:13:57.740]  he wants to, he hates Jews, I want to play that clip in a moment of those kids.
[03:13:57.740 --> 03:14:01.660]  I'm going to bring David Nott here in a moment.
[03:14:01.660 --> 03:14:06.540]  It's just, it's incredible.
[03:14:06.540 --> 03:14:11.620]  It's like, because they think you're dumb, they're just hoping you have doubt, don't
[03:14:11.620 --> 03:14:12.620]  have any doubt.
[03:14:12.620 --> 03:14:19.020]  Donald Trump didn't say he hates Jews, find the clip.
[03:14:19.020 --> 03:14:25.780]  Obama said it was free under Obamacare and he said, you keep your doctor, that was all
[03:14:25.780 --> 03:14:26.780]  lies.
[03:14:26.780 --> 03:14:30.860]  And it doesn't matter what social justice warrior says, okay?
[03:14:30.860 --> 03:14:31.860]  It doesn't matter.
[03:14:31.860 --> 03:14:38.300]  My family was, and I'm proud of this, literally at the heart of starting the Texas Revolution
[03:14:38.300 --> 03:14:41.660]  on my mom's side.
[03:14:41.660 --> 03:14:45.860]  We raised Colonel Travis' son on my dad's side of the Revolutionary War, both sides
[03:14:45.860 --> 03:14:48.700]  of my family on the Mayflower.
[03:14:48.700 --> 03:14:50.260]  I'm so proud of my ancestors.
[03:14:50.260 --> 03:14:58.700]  They were just, almost all of them were just these awesome, super badass patriots and you
[03:14:58.700 --> 03:15:07.620]  sit there and you call in and you tell me I'm not for real, and then I'm an operation.
[03:15:07.620 --> 03:15:10.100]  You don't make me sad because you attacked my good name.
[03:15:10.100 --> 03:15:19.180]  You make me sad because you're such a dishonorable coward and you're not going to win.
[03:15:19.180 --> 03:15:22.380]  You understand that no matter what you do.
[03:15:22.380 --> 03:15:23.700]  I intend to win.
[03:15:23.700 --> 03:15:28.380]  We're going to take the country back and our ideas will end up being on national television
[03:15:28.380 --> 03:15:29.380]  in the end.
[03:15:29.380 --> 03:15:30.380]  They're even saying that in the New York Times.
[03:15:30.380 --> 03:15:31.380]  They're panicking.
[03:15:31.380 --> 03:15:36.420]  Freedom trumps all your garbage all day, and I don't mean that as a pun, and I don't completely
[03:15:36.420 --> 03:15:42.860]  trust Trump, but he knows which way the wind's blowing, bare minimum, and I think he's good
[03:15:42.860 --> 03:15:43.860]  at heart.
[03:15:43.860 --> 03:15:46.780]  You don't have to be perfect, but man, who wants to gut the country and make everybody
[03:15:46.780 --> 03:15:52.180]  poor so you can all be equally miserable?
[03:15:52.180 --> 03:15:55.260]  So I want to go to Eric and Josh and Jeff and Chris and all of it.
[03:15:55.260 --> 03:15:56.460]  This guy, these people are always the same.
[03:15:56.460 --> 03:15:59.980]  He'll make statements, I'll let me talk, you're going to let me now, Alex, because he craves
[03:15:59.980 --> 03:16:00.980]  the control.
[03:16:00.980 --> 03:16:05.380]  So they want you poured under their control so they dull out and tell their OCD, and they
[03:16:05.380 --> 03:16:07.300]  tell you how everything runs.
[03:16:07.300 --> 03:16:08.700]  Don't tell me how to behave.
[03:16:08.700 --> 03:16:09.820]  Don't tell me what to do.
[03:16:09.820 --> 03:16:13.940]  Don't do all your little OCD clicks and ticks.
[03:16:13.940 --> 03:16:18.420]  Just make your counter statements for 60 seconds or longer if you'd like.
[03:16:18.420 --> 03:16:21.940]  Mr. Social Justice Warrior, go ahead.
[03:16:21.940 --> 03:16:29.220]  Three hours of you talking about the fake left-right paradigm, followed by 10 minutes
[03:16:29.220 --> 03:16:37.860]  of commercials, richmoney.rich.com, snake oil commercials, products that I've ordered
[03:16:37.860 --> 03:16:39.460]  that don't work.
[03:16:39.460 --> 03:16:44.420]  You are the epitome, Mr. Jones, of a Charlton.
[03:16:44.420 --> 03:16:50.700]  You're leading, you're actually leading sheep to the chessboard.
[03:16:50.700 --> 03:16:52.380]  That's all you're doing.
[03:16:52.380 --> 03:16:57.740]  And now that you've really shown your true colors by climbing into bed with the likes
[03:16:57.740 --> 03:17:03.340]  of people like, let's see, Donald Trump, Larry Nichols, et cetera, et cetera, you have shown
[03:17:03.340 --> 03:17:07.380]  your hand to be what you are, Alex, a true fraudster.
[03:17:07.380 --> 03:17:08.980]  You're just in it for the money.
[03:17:08.980 --> 03:17:16.140]  I mean, your whole staging, your whole marketing, your whole presentation with your suits and
[03:17:16.140 --> 03:17:22.900]  your, you're just, you know, all of the money that you've made, you've made it on the ignorance
[03:17:22.900 --> 03:17:25.860]  of the audience that tunes into you every day.
[03:17:25.860 --> 03:17:26.860]  All right.
[03:17:26.860 --> 03:17:27.860]  And you say this thing.
[03:17:27.860 --> 03:17:28.860]  I'm going to respond to you now.
[03:17:28.860 --> 03:17:30.020]  You talk for one minute.
[03:17:30.020 --> 03:17:33.300]  You understand how local affiliates and radio works.
[03:17:33.300 --> 03:17:34.660]  There are network ads.
[03:17:34.660 --> 03:17:36.420]  There are local ads.
[03:17:36.420 --> 03:17:37.420]  There are syndication ads.
[03:17:37.420 --> 03:17:40.820]  There's like four or five different types of ads, depending on how you're listening.
[03:17:40.820 --> 03:17:41.820]  Okay?
[03:17:41.820 --> 03:17:46.580]  So I hear that ad you mentioned all over national radio, it's a national buy.
[03:17:46.580 --> 03:17:49.900]  It's on the network and I have been offered those types of sponsors.
[03:17:49.900 --> 03:17:51.020]  I don't take them.
[03:17:51.020 --> 03:17:58.140]  When you hear it, it's my voice or one of my reporters and I absolutely love X2.
[03:17:58.140 --> 03:18:03.420]  When I'm having allergies or coughing, I mean, lung cleanse works great for me.
[03:18:03.420 --> 03:18:07.220]  On third party sites, it's got five star reviews by the hundreds and hundreds.
[03:18:07.220 --> 03:18:15.500]  So absolutely, I am proud that we open up a shop to promote freedom and fund ourselves.
[03:18:15.500 --> 03:18:18.620]  Then they set founding fathers over to France and sit there at parties and beg and sell
[03:18:18.620 --> 03:18:22.100]  little American flags and try to get money for the revolution.
[03:18:22.100 --> 03:18:26.060]  Most revolutionaries, you know, rob banks and stuff and some revolutions, people have
[03:18:26.060 --> 03:18:29.740]  their wives whore out and people see that as honorable and some revolutions.
[03:18:29.740 --> 03:18:31.620]  I wouldn't do that.
[03:18:31.620 --> 03:18:34.900]  So you know, we're not having our wives at a brothel to fund this.
[03:18:34.900 --> 03:18:39.380]  We're not robbing banks, we're like selling air purifiers and water purifiers that if
[03:18:39.380 --> 03:18:43.140]  you're not using your nuts that I personally use, I'm going to skip this network break
[03:18:43.140 --> 03:18:48.060]  here and you don't say where my politics are wrong.
[03:18:48.060 --> 03:18:49.540]  Larry Nichols is scum.
[03:18:49.540 --> 03:18:51.620]  Larry Nichols, if you don't know who he is, never talks about it.
[03:18:51.620 --> 03:18:53.740]  I know people that were in the military at the time.
[03:18:53.740 --> 03:18:59.540]  He was a Green Beret officer who fought communists all over Latin America and Africa and was
[03:18:59.540 --> 03:19:04.780]  highly decorated and was sent by the CIA to basically be embedded with the Clintons.
[03:19:04.780 --> 03:19:08.020]  Clintons was CIA and prepare him for the governorship.
[03:19:08.020 --> 03:19:11.500]  And that guy, when the Clintons started killing kids, he went public and they tried to kill
[03:19:11.500 --> 03:19:12.500]  him.
[03:19:12.500 --> 03:19:17.340]  And you know, the guy, it's like crisis on the cross and he's got, you know, the thief
[03:19:17.340 --> 03:19:18.340]  and the murderer beside him.
[03:19:18.340 --> 03:19:19.340]  I forget which one it is.
[03:19:19.340 --> 03:19:24.220]  And you know, one of them apologizes and repents and God felt it and said, you'll be with
[03:19:24.220 --> 03:19:25.700]  me in paradise tonight.
[03:19:25.700 --> 03:19:29.700]  And you sit there with Larry Nichols calling him a charlton.
[03:19:29.700 --> 03:19:32.500]  What I happen to know that there have been times when he's supposed to be on the show
[03:19:32.500 --> 03:19:35.620]  and he is, they're there with defibrillators.
[03:19:35.620 --> 03:19:38.100]  That guy has been, uh, died.
[03:19:38.100 --> 03:19:39.100]  Okay.
[03:19:39.100 --> 03:19:40.100]  I'm okay.
[03:19:40.100 --> 03:19:41.100]  He wanted, he didn't want to talk about it.
[03:19:41.100 --> 03:19:42.100]  I am.
[03:19:42.100 --> 03:19:45.340]  That guy has been dying lately and they're in there defibrillating him to get back up
[03:19:45.340 --> 03:19:46.340]  and fight.
[03:19:46.340 --> 03:19:49.540]  And you sit there and you call him a wimp when you're nothing.
[03:19:49.540 --> 03:19:51.380]  I don't know what your problem is.
[03:19:51.380 --> 03:19:54.780]  I don't know what your deal is, but I'm sick of it.
[03:19:54.780 --> 03:19:59.980]  You sit there and you, you say someone that's challenged the Clinton crime machine is a piece
[03:19:59.980 --> 03:20:00.980]  of filth.
[03:20:00.980 --> 03:20:01.980]  I mean, I'm going to ask questions.
[03:20:01.980 --> 03:20:04.980]  Do you social justice warrior?
[03:20:04.980 --> 03:20:11.100]  Do you support Hillary Rodham Clinton because you don't like people that don't like her?
[03:20:11.100 --> 03:20:15.980]  How long are you going to support the Jewish Zionist paradigm, Alex?
[03:20:15.980 --> 03:20:16.980]  Oh my God.
[03:20:16.980 --> 03:20:17.980]  The total.
[03:20:17.980 --> 03:20:18.980]  Go ahead.
[03:20:18.980 --> 03:20:19.980]  Tell me about the Jews.
[03:20:19.980 --> 03:20:20.980]  Go ahead.
[03:20:20.980 --> 03:20:21.980]  You have 60 seconds.
[03:20:21.980 --> 03:20:25.980]  How long are you going to hide behind the 10,000 pound elephant in the room?
[03:20:25.980 --> 03:20:30.580]  What are you going to talk about instead of calling people global with Alex, why don't
[03:20:30.580 --> 03:20:32.820]  you spell it out for your audience?
[03:20:32.820 --> 03:20:42.100]  It's Jewish Zionist David Duke handed your ass in a can and you did all.
[03:20:42.100 --> 03:20:46.940]  The only thing that you did was sit there and try to derail this man as you've tried
[03:20:46.940 --> 03:20:47.940]  to derail me now.
[03:20:47.940 --> 03:20:52.860]  And if you've tried to insinuate that I just called Larry Nichols a charlatan, I called
[03:20:52.860 --> 03:20:59.020]  you specifically a Charlotte, Mr. Joe, you said people, you said bad people like Larry
[03:20:59.020 --> 03:21:01.020]  Nichols.
[03:21:01.020 --> 03:21:07.860]  I went and interviewed Lois Farrakhan to really try to have a real interview and he was genuine
[03:21:07.860 --> 03:21:08.860]  and real.
[03:21:08.860 --> 03:21:10.020]  Even though I don't agree with some of the things he said.
[03:21:10.020 --> 03:21:12.260]  And so he talked 90% of the time.
[03:21:12.260 --> 03:21:16.700]  David Duke, we timed it out, talked almost 70% of the time and bitched and whined the
[03:21:16.700 --> 03:21:20.740]  whole time that I wasn't letting him talk when I was trying to bring up eugenics and
[03:21:20.740 --> 03:21:27.300]  how we're all being targeted by this, things like Gardasil and he didn't want that, okay?
[03:21:27.300 --> 03:21:33.220]  And so he didn't want access to my audience to try to have a real discussion or his supporters
[03:21:33.220 --> 03:21:34.820]  didn't.
[03:21:34.820 --> 03:21:39.140]  And man, I have people tell me I'm Jewish and that I get orders from Israel and that
[03:21:39.140 --> 03:21:42.060]  I get Jewish money and none of it's true.
[03:21:42.060 --> 03:21:46.260]  And you act like you're on some high and mighty or the Koch brothers or the Catholic Church.
[03:21:46.260 --> 03:21:48.540]  I've had all these mentally ill groups.
[03:21:48.540 --> 03:21:56.780]  I fund myself selling products and having a few sponsors that are mine and that I endorse.
[03:21:56.780 --> 03:22:03.580]  It's just crazy that there are a lot of black people that have been brainwashing or racist
[03:22:03.580 --> 03:22:05.140]  and weird who hate me.
[03:22:05.140 --> 03:22:07.900]  I don't hate other black people because some black people are weird.
[03:22:07.900 --> 03:22:09.900]  There are a lot of weird white people that hate me.
[03:22:09.900 --> 03:22:12.780]  I mean, I'm so hated by the white supremacists and people because there's so government
[03:22:12.780 --> 03:22:13.780]  connected and run.
[03:22:13.780 --> 03:22:17.940]  That's come out so many times because they want to brand the anti-globalism movement
[03:22:17.940 --> 03:22:20.980]  as anti-black, anti-Hispanic, anti-Jew.
[03:22:20.980 --> 03:22:24.540]  And that's a management tactic by the big media to make it all that.
[03:22:24.540 --> 03:22:28.780]  Is there a Jewish mafia that's involved in it, heavily involved, commanding many parts
[03:22:28.780 --> 03:22:30.300]  of it like some of the Redstone?
[03:22:30.300 --> 03:22:31.300]  Absolutely.
[03:22:31.300 --> 03:22:34.940]  And I just come in and say, globalism attacks everybody and we should come together against
[03:22:34.940 --> 03:22:35.940]  it.
[03:22:35.940 --> 03:22:40.580]  And most Jews aren't part of the Jewish mafia and there's all sorts of other mafias involved.
[03:22:40.580 --> 03:22:45.060]  This is a eugenics, scientific, technocracy system at the top.
[03:22:45.060 --> 03:22:48.420]  It uses all these other paradigms of management.
[03:22:48.420 --> 03:22:52.220]  And so I'm my own person.
[03:22:52.220 --> 03:22:56.940]  And so I choose not to bash Protestants, Catholics, Jews, anybody.
[03:22:56.940 --> 03:23:01.900]  The Pope comes out and says, Christ was like ISIS and we should be ashamed of our Christian
[03:23:01.900 --> 03:23:02.900]  roots.
[03:23:02.900 --> 03:23:05.540]  Or I think he said horrified by it or whatever it was.
[03:23:05.540 --> 03:23:07.500]  And I'm like, that is an anti-Christian statement.
[03:23:07.500 --> 03:23:08.780]  This man is evil.
[03:23:08.780 --> 03:23:12.060]  By his own words, he is blasphemous, okay?
[03:23:12.060 --> 03:23:13.060]  I love Catholics.
[03:23:13.060 --> 03:23:15.220]  They're good people.
[03:23:15.220 --> 03:23:17.380]  I loved the Jews I know in my life.
[03:23:17.380 --> 03:23:20.300]  My whole life have just been really smart, cool people.
[03:23:20.300 --> 03:23:25.100]  My dad has friends, you know, one guy's a geologist, friend from college with all these
[03:23:25.100 --> 03:23:29.180]  long geology trips when I was a kid in Big Bend and Texas and Arizona and just really
[03:23:29.180 --> 03:23:33.940]  smart and cool and nice and cared about, you know, all I've ever had is Jews I knew that
[03:23:33.940 --> 03:23:37.020]  were nice and were actually there and intellectual wanted to help me.
[03:23:37.020 --> 03:23:38.020]  Okay.
[03:23:38.020 --> 03:23:40.540]  Then I see these evil people that happen to be Jewish up there.
[03:23:40.540 --> 03:23:45.940]  Those people that sold out, you know, somebody like Alan Greenspan was like a Ron Paul in
[03:23:45.940 --> 03:23:47.420]  the 60s and 70s.
[03:23:47.420 --> 03:23:51.180]  He was writing books, he was writing white papers about the Federal Reserve and how it
[03:23:51.180 --> 03:23:54.060]  was private and evil and go back to gold or the New World Order.
[03:23:54.060 --> 03:23:59.500]  They bought him out like Anakin Skywalker and he became Darth Vader.
[03:23:59.500 --> 03:24:02.020]  So again, it's just crazy.
[03:24:02.020 --> 03:24:03.020]  It's like Italians.
[03:24:03.020 --> 03:24:06.300]  It's like, I'm not going to hire Italians because there's an Italian mafia and you know,
[03:24:06.300 --> 03:24:09.060]  one tenth of one percent of Italians are in a mafia.
[03:24:09.060 --> 03:24:10.860]  It's just, it's idiotic.
[03:24:10.860 --> 03:24:13.860]  I made a film.
[03:24:13.860 --> 03:24:17.900]  I produced called Fabled Enemies about criminal elements of Israel and their involvement in
[03:24:17.900 --> 03:24:24.300]  9-11 that was the most hardcore out there and it made the Jew haters 50 times matter.
[03:24:24.300 --> 03:24:30.380]  I made a film, well, a terror storm that had a section on Gulf of Tonkin, but also a section
[03:24:30.380 --> 03:24:31.380]  on a bunch of other false flags.
[03:24:31.380 --> 03:24:32.660]  I liked the USS Liberty.
[03:24:32.660 --> 03:24:38.900]  It made the Jew haters just see, they said, no, no one else does false flags, Jews.
[03:24:38.900 --> 03:24:40.700]  No, there's evil Jews.
[03:24:40.700 --> 03:24:41.700]  There's good Jews.
[03:24:41.700 --> 03:24:42.700]  There's good Germans.
[03:24:42.700 --> 03:24:43.700]  There's bad Germans.
[03:24:43.700 --> 03:24:44.700]  There's bad Chinese.
[03:24:44.700 --> 03:24:45.700]  There's good Mexicans.
[03:24:45.700 --> 03:24:46.700]  There's bad Mexicans.
[03:24:46.700 --> 03:24:52.100]  You judge a tree by its fruits and you guys just fall back because you're better than
[03:24:52.100 --> 03:24:53.100]  anybody.
[03:24:53.100 --> 03:24:58.100]  You can just say someone works for the Jews and sit back and be moral and be superior
[03:24:58.100 --> 03:25:01.300]  like a social justice warrior that you're just like them.
[03:25:01.300 --> 03:25:04.860]  That's why you called yourself that today.
[03:25:04.860 --> 03:25:08.820]  You didn't say, I am a person that believes in a Jewish conspiracy.
[03:25:08.820 --> 03:25:10.220]  You've been put on air.
[03:25:10.220 --> 03:25:14.580]  You let you guys on and we don't screen your calls, but you said you were a social justice
[03:25:14.580 --> 03:25:19.380]  warrior and out of their mouths, out of the mouths of babes, you will hear truth.
[03:25:19.380 --> 03:25:20.380]  You're right.
[03:25:20.380 --> 03:25:22.100]  They're just like they show up and they scream, you're a racist.
[03:25:22.100 --> 03:25:24.380]  You hate Mexicans or white guy.
[03:25:24.380 --> 03:25:28.660]  You hate Jews like these little Jewish kids saying that Donald Trump hates Jews.
[03:25:28.660 --> 03:25:29.940]  It's the exact same thing.
[03:25:29.940 --> 03:25:31.300]  You can't even see it.
[03:25:31.300 --> 03:25:32.860]  You're not an intellectual.
[03:25:32.860 --> 03:25:38.300]  You're a pseudo-intellectual who lines up these things that makes you feel like you've
[03:25:38.300 --> 03:25:40.300]  got all the answers.
[03:25:40.300 --> 03:25:44.700]  I mean, you can sit there and read all these things about Jews running this and Jews running
[03:25:44.700 --> 03:25:49.980]  that and then just project it onto Jews as if they weren't there, your whole world would
[03:25:49.980 --> 03:25:50.980]  be okay.
[03:25:50.980 --> 03:25:56.300]  Some of the redstone hates the fact that I attack him for his anti-family activities
[03:25:56.300 --> 03:26:05.260]  and don't point out that he is a super hardcore racist Jew.
[03:26:05.260 --> 03:26:09.500]  But old-fashioned Judaism was just like every other group saying our group's the best for
[03:26:09.500 --> 03:26:10.820]  everybody else's filth.
[03:26:10.820 --> 03:26:14.660]  That's tribalism.
[03:26:14.660 --> 03:26:17.460]  But I don't dislike some of the redstone because he's an old Jewish guy.
[03:26:17.460 --> 03:26:19.340]  I dislike him because he's anti-human.
[03:26:19.340 --> 03:26:25.300]  See, this is the spirit of the people we face, not their cover.
[03:26:25.300 --> 03:26:27.340]  And you think you're looking deeper.
[03:26:27.340 --> 03:26:28.340]  You're not.
[03:26:28.340 --> 03:26:32.460]  And all these anti-Semitic people that are into all this stuff, I know they over-project
[03:26:32.460 --> 03:26:34.980]  that and demonize and the Israeli lobbies out of control.
[03:26:34.980 --> 03:26:36.580]  I cover it all.
[03:26:36.580 --> 03:26:39.460]  I talk about the Chinese lobby, the Saudi Arabian lobby, the Israeli lobby, being out
[03:26:39.460 --> 03:26:40.460]  of control.
[03:26:40.460 --> 03:26:41.540]  Stop trying to run our country.
[03:26:41.540 --> 03:26:43.580]  And they go, you piece of filth, Jones.
[03:26:43.580 --> 03:26:47.620]  He was covering up for the Jews today when he talked about Israel and their lobby and
[03:26:47.620 --> 03:26:48.900]  how it's a little out of control.
[03:26:48.900 --> 03:26:51.180]  No, it's all out of control, Alex.
[03:26:51.180 --> 03:26:54.420]  So look, it's about you being in the winning club.
[03:26:54.420 --> 03:26:55.420]  You're the purest.
[03:26:55.420 --> 03:26:56.500]  You're the good man.
[03:26:56.500 --> 03:26:59.260]  So just say goodnight to the bad guy.
[03:26:59.260 --> 03:27:00.260]  Go ahead.
[03:27:00.260 --> 03:27:01.260]  Tell me I work for the Jews.
[03:27:01.260 --> 03:27:07.780]  Go ahead, social justice lawyer, get yourself a gold star over at Stormfront.
[03:27:07.780 --> 03:27:08.780]  Unbelievable.
[03:27:08.780 --> 03:27:09.780]  It's unbelievable.
[03:27:09.780 --> 03:27:10.780]  Unbelievable.
[03:27:10.780 --> 03:27:19.180]  You use, you spend 10 minutes, 10 minutes and you don't give the caller a chance to
[03:27:19.180 --> 03:27:20.180]  even...
[03:27:20.180 --> 03:27:23.220]  To excuse some more false allegations, you're the ones making the allegations.
[03:27:23.220 --> 03:27:24.780]  You're not worried about the New World Order.
[03:27:24.780 --> 03:27:27.940]  You're worried I'm working for the Jews over here because I'm promoting free market and
[03:27:27.940 --> 03:27:31.380]  family and second amendment and religious rights and sovereignty.
[03:27:31.380 --> 03:27:33.180]  Oh my God, I'm so bad.
[03:27:33.180 --> 03:27:34.660]  What is it I'm doing this bad?
[03:27:34.660 --> 03:27:37.420]  Tell me what I'm doing that isn't promoting freedom.
[03:27:37.420 --> 03:27:38.420]  Tell me.
[03:27:38.420 --> 03:27:40.860]  Other than I work for the Jews, tell me.
[03:27:40.860 --> 03:27:41.860]  I'm waiting.
[03:27:41.860 --> 03:27:42.860]  You're not.
[03:27:42.860 --> 03:27:47.060]  The truth is I have the Jewish lobby constantly attacking me my whole career.
[03:27:47.060 --> 03:27:48.060]  That's the truth.
[03:27:48.060 --> 03:27:51.420]  But you're over here saying I work for these people, so explain it to me.
[03:27:51.420 --> 03:27:52.420]  Go ahead.
[03:27:52.420 --> 03:27:53.420]  Explain to me right now.
[03:27:53.420 --> 03:27:59.940]  You have Jewish lobbies attacking you, Alex, for goodness sakes, give me a darn break.
[03:27:59.940 --> 03:28:03.540]  What you're doing is trying to obfuscate and confuse you.
[03:28:03.540 --> 03:28:04.540]  You're obfuscating.
[03:28:04.540 --> 03:28:05.540]  You're obfuscating.
[03:28:05.540 --> 03:28:06.540]  There's lots of lobbies.
[03:28:06.540 --> 03:28:07.540]  What do you mean?
[03:28:07.540 --> 03:28:08.540]  The fact is the mainstream media attacks me and calls me anti-semitic.
[03:28:08.540 --> 03:28:10.660]  Okay, I'm done talking to you.
[03:28:10.660 --> 03:28:11.660]  I mean, you just hear that guy.
[03:28:11.660 --> 03:28:13.060]  He listens to his own voice.
[03:28:13.060 --> 03:28:15.060]  Just give me a break, Alex.
[03:28:15.060 --> 03:28:16.300]  I got a Chapman here.
[03:28:16.300 --> 03:28:17.300]  I got a Chapman here real quick.
[03:28:17.300 --> 03:28:18.300]  Go ahead, John.
[03:28:18.300 --> 03:28:19.860]  By the way, David Knight doesn't mind.
[03:28:19.860 --> 03:28:22.300]  He knows during the fourth hour, some days I take over, he loves it.
[03:28:22.300 --> 03:28:25.300]  Everyone's like, hey, we're returning here, David Knight or Paul Watson, what are you
[03:28:25.300 --> 03:28:26.300]  doing taking over?
[03:28:26.300 --> 03:28:27.300]  I can do it fourth hour every day.
[03:28:27.300 --> 03:28:28.540]  I don't have the energy every day.
[03:28:28.540 --> 03:28:31.300]  These guys are smarter than I have many respects, so we all augment each other.
[03:28:31.300 --> 03:28:33.460]  Just like some days I can't do the show, he does the whole show.
[03:28:33.460 --> 03:28:35.180]  So David is good, right, David?
[03:28:35.180 --> 03:28:38.300]  Even though he's still in the studio in there.
[03:28:38.300 --> 03:28:39.300]  David, you ready to come in?
[03:28:39.300 --> 03:28:41.460]  Yeah, I can't bear to listen to people like that.
[03:28:41.460 --> 03:28:42.460]  You know, trolls don't like that.
[03:28:42.460 --> 03:28:43.460]  Oh, so you've left the room.
[03:28:43.460 --> 03:28:44.460]  I'm sorry.
[03:28:44.460 --> 03:28:45.460]  No, I'm here.
[03:28:45.460 --> 03:28:46.460]  I'm here.
[03:28:46.460 --> 03:28:47.460]  Can you hear me?
[03:28:47.460 --> 03:28:48.460]  Well, you're awesome, but explain to folks that I'm not, like, needly taking over the
[03:28:48.460 --> 03:28:49.460]  show.
[03:28:49.460 --> 03:28:52.220]  I was right, and I've worked for Alex for four years.
[03:28:52.220 --> 03:28:55.900]  I know what Alex is, and I know he's not a sellout.
[03:28:55.900 --> 03:28:57.060]  He is totally in this.
[03:28:57.060 --> 03:29:01.220]  I wouldn't even be here if you weren't in the fight for Liberty, Alex, and pouring everything
[03:29:01.220 --> 03:29:05.940]  that you get back into this operation, not because you want to make money when we had
[03:29:05.940 --> 03:29:08.140]  the attack at Sandy Hook.
[03:29:08.140 --> 03:29:12.580]  You were shutting down commercials, skipping commercial breaks left and right, not plugging
[03:29:12.580 --> 03:29:16.620]  anything that you sell, not letting any other commercials on because I can't get that information
[03:29:16.620 --> 03:29:17.620]  out.
[03:29:17.620 --> 03:29:18.620]  Exactly.
[03:29:18.620 --> 03:29:22.460]  I've been here for four years, and I don't really have any patience to listen to these
[03:29:22.460 --> 03:29:24.380]  David Duke Nazis.
[03:29:24.380 --> 03:29:25.540]  I'm from the South.
[03:29:25.540 --> 03:29:27.500]  I've heard the Ku Klux Klan before.
[03:29:27.500 --> 03:29:29.500]  They're full of it, and I don't have the time to listen to these guys.
[03:29:29.500 --> 03:29:30.500]  I agree.
[03:29:30.500 --> 03:29:31.500]  Let's come back and talk about it.
[03:29:31.500 --> 03:29:34.540]  I've never seen John Harmon want to just jump in randomly up in Minnesota, so let's hear
[03:29:34.540 --> 03:29:35.540]  from him.
[03:29:35.540 --> 03:29:36.540]  Yeah, I know.
[03:29:36.540 --> 03:29:40.380]  I've been at the Dairy Queen when I'm 16 with a cute local girl and had guys pull in with
[03:29:40.380 --> 03:29:44.380]  four trucks and get out and go, we're going to beat your butt, Yankee, because you're with
[03:29:44.380 --> 03:29:48.300]  a good-looking girl, and we're in a county that my family basically found it.
[03:29:48.300 --> 03:29:49.300]  Yeah.
[03:29:49.300 --> 03:29:50.980]  We're on the march.
[03:29:50.980 --> 03:29:53.380]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.380 --> 03:30:18.740]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:18.740 --> 03:30:23.020]  The company announced its advertisers will now appear on third-party apps and websites
[03:30:23.020 --> 03:30:27.380]  for anyone who's ever visited Facebook, not just for those who are logged in.
[03:30:27.380 --> 03:30:28.380]  And that's not all.
[03:30:28.380 --> 03:30:33.340]  If you have the Facebook app on your phone, it could be listening to what you say at all
[03:30:33.340 --> 03:30:34.340]  times.
[03:30:34.340 --> 03:30:38.500]  Facebook says its app does listen to what's happening around it, but only as a way to
[03:30:38.500 --> 03:30:41.940]  see what people are into so they can suggest you post about it.
[03:30:41.940 --> 03:30:46.020]  They claim not to use microphone audio for targeted advertising.
[03:30:46.020 --> 03:30:50.900]  Find out how to disable off-site ad tracking by visiting infowars.com, read the article,
[03:30:50.900 --> 03:30:55.900]  Facebook quietly ops users into off-site ad tracking, here's how to disable it.
[03:30:55.900 --> 03:31:25.860]  The end marketer reporting for infowars.com.
[03:31:25.860 --> 03:31:54.260]  of infowars.com.
[03:31:54.260 --> 03:31:59.660]  Go to infowarsstore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:31:59.660 --> 03:32:04.580]  More than two years ago, infowars first told you about our research into what has been
[03:32:04.580 --> 03:32:06.300]  called the iodine conspiracy.
[03:32:06.300 --> 03:32:10.700]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[03:32:10.700 --> 03:32:15.900]  devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and
[03:32:15.900 --> 03:32:19.620]  adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[03:32:19.620 --> 03:32:24.620]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis
[03:32:24.620 --> 03:32:29.260]  worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself
[03:32:29.260 --> 03:32:30.260]  and your family.
[03:32:30.260 --> 03:32:35.740]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[03:32:35.740 --> 03:32:41.540]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[03:32:41.540 --> 03:32:43.140]  ever concerning iodine.
[03:32:43.140 --> 03:32:45.100]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[03:32:45.100 --> 03:32:49.380]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to
[03:32:49.380 --> 03:32:51.260]  any optimum health regimen.
[03:32:51.260 --> 03:33:03.420]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:33:03.420 --> 03:33:23.300]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:23.300 --> 03:33:26.940]  I'll tell you what it is about all these weird camps and Larry Nichols was talking about
[03:33:26.940 --> 03:33:28.980]  this earlier when he was talking about how to defeat the globalists.
[03:33:28.980 --> 03:33:34.260]  You've got to come together around basic sovereignty, basic free market, basic rights to process.
[03:33:34.260 --> 03:33:40.700]  There's all these groups that want to bully you into being into their little pet project.
[03:33:40.700 --> 03:33:48.260]  I remember 13 years ago, I got a call and an email and it's like, you will expose the
[03:33:48.260 --> 03:33:57.540]  black pope and that the Jesuits run everything or we will expose you as a co-adjutor or something.
[03:33:57.540 --> 03:34:01.540]  I was just like, who the hell's this, I'll never interview that person threatening me
[03:34:01.540 --> 03:34:02.540]  like that.
[03:34:02.540 --> 03:34:07.860]  And they're like, look, Alex Jones is a Jesuit and there was some black guy named Alex Jones,
[03:34:07.860 --> 03:34:12.140]  they were like passing links around, they're like, respond to the fact that you're a Jesuit
[03:34:12.140 --> 03:34:16.100]  preacher and I'm like, no, I'm a Protestant and that's a black guy named Alex Jones.
[03:34:16.100 --> 03:34:17.100]  You people are crazy.
[03:34:17.100 --> 03:34:21.140]  Oh, you're not going to interview us now as we expose you as a Jesuit.
[03:34:21.140 --> 03:34:24.180]  I'm just like, what on earth are you people smoking?
[03:34:24.180 --> 03:34:29.460]  And then they're like, what, you're not saying the Catholic church shouldn't corrupt?
[03:34:29.460 --> 03:34:33.180]  And I'm like, no, more and more, it's promoting globalism, it's being infiltrated, being taken
[03:34:33.180 --> 03:34:35.020]  over by all the pedophiles and the rest of it.
[03:34:35.020 --> 03:34:38.180]  I said, I really just want to promote freedom and try to honor the Federal Reserve and get
[03:34:38.180 --> 03:34:39.180]  our country back.
[03:34:39.180 --> 03:34:44.500]  But yeah, that isn't enough, we know you're working with them.
[03:34:44.500 --> 03:34:48.500]  They like glue my head on top of women and say, Alex Jones is a tranny, here's the proof.
[03:34:48.500 --> 03:34:56.620]  I mean, just blasphemous, false witness stuff, but I got to be honest, you know, the Catholics
[03:34:56.620 --> 03:34:58.380]  run it all crowd.
[03:34:58.380 --> 03:35:05.080]  They don't have, they don't have anything on the anti Jew crowd and it's just a big
[03:35:05.080 --> 03:35:08.620]  diversion from everything.
[03:35:08.620 --> 03:35:10.820]  It's a total diversion.
[03:35:10.820 --> 03:35:13.540]  Is there a Jewish mafia at the highest levels of the new world order?
[03:35:13.540 --> 03:35:14.540]  Absolutely.
[03:35:14.540 --> 03:35:17.780]  Do the Rothschilds end up taking over Europe and the Napoleonic Wars?
[03:35:17.780 --> 03:35:19.780]  They find it both sides?
[03:35:19.780 --> 03:35:20.780]  Absolutely.
[03:35:20.780 --> 03:35:24.660]  Totally true.
[03:35:24.660 --> 03:35:30.100]  There's also all sorts of weird, bizarre eugenics, Germanic death cults at the highest level.
[03:35:30.100 --> 03:35:31.900]  It's just bad stuff.
[03:35:31.900 --> 03:35:32.900]  It's bad stuff.
[03:35:32.900 --> 03:35:37.780]  You can call it whatever name you want, but it's like they got this big man to us.
[03:35:37.780 --> 03:35:38.780]  I got on air.
[03:35:38.780 --> 03:35:39.780]  Choose, choose, I won't say choose.
[03:35:39.780 --> 03:35:41.780]  I'm like, do we screen your call?
[03:35:41.780 --> 03:35:42.780]  No.
[03:35:42.780 --> 03:35:43.780]  Okay.
[03:35:43.780 --> 03:35:44.780]  You know.
[03:35:44.780 --> 03:35:45.780]  Well, you're one of them.
[03:35:45.780 --> 03:35:52.540]  And it's just like, no, I'm legitimate in that I'm really doing what I think is best
[03:35:52.540 --> 03:35:54.660]  and telling the truth here.
[03:35:54.660 --> 03:35:58.660]  But they think they get a big score when they make it about race, just like social justice
[03:35:58.660 --> 03:35:59.660]  wars.
[03:35:59.660 --> 03:36:01.500]  And I apologize to Josh and Jeff and Chris and Eric.
[03:36:01.500 --> 03:36:05.780]  I'm going to get to you and then let, let our normal host in the fourth hour of this
[03:36:05.780 --> 03:36:09.780]  day, David, not taking over, but David, John Harmon wants to pop into up there in Minnesota,
[03:36:09.780 --> 03:36:10.780]  run on the board.
[03:36:10.780 --> 03:36:15.140]  But let's get your take on this, though, a few calls and I'm going to get Harmon in
[03:36:15.140 --> 03:36:16.140]  there.
[03:36:16.140 --> 03:36:17.140]  We're going to punch out.
[03:36:17.140 --> 03:36:21.140]  No, one of the things I was going to talk about today, Alex, was the talking points
[03:36:21.140 --> 03:36:24.060]  that are being done, not only by the Democrats, we've got Hillary Clinton coming out against
[03:36:24.060 --> 03:36:26.140]  Donald Trump saying his foreign policy positions are dangerous.
[03:36:26.140 --> 03:36:28.140]  Of course, John Kerry is doing the same thing.
[03:36:28.140 --> 03:36:30.740]  Say foreign policy is not a business deal.
[03:36:30.740 --> 03:36:31.740]  Okay.
[03:36:31.740 --> 03:36:35.940]  There's also another fellow Scullum Bones man who is now running for high office.
[03:36:35.940 --> 03:36:39.820]  And that's William Weld, who got the VP nomination with the Libertarian Party.
[03:36:39.820 --> 03:36:45.100]  And as we look at these people, John Kerry, William Weld, Hillary Clinton, they're globalists,
[03:36:45.100 --> 03:36:46.100]  they're not Jews.
[03:36:46.100 --> 03:36:47.100]  Okay.
[03:36:47.100 --> 03:36:51.020]  When you look at William Weld, he is part of the Harvard royalty.
[03:36:51.020 --> 03:36:55.740]  His ancestor was one of the first graduating class, class of 1650.
[03:36:55.740 --> 03:37:00.020]  He's had 18 generations of Harvard men, two buildings are named after him.
[03:37:00.020 --> 03:37:01.020]  Okay.
[03:37:01.020 --> 03:37:03.420]  Those people, however, are coming after our freedoms.
[03:37:03.420 --> 03:37:07.380]  He's out saying, he sees absolutely nothing criminal in Hillary Clinton's emails.
[03:37:07.380 --> 03:37:09.140]  This is New York Times article.
[03:37:09.140 --> 03:37:14.660]  And even the New York Times says his comments could inflame criticism that William Weld
[03:37:14.660 --> 03:37:20.340]  is a de facto stalking horse for Clinton in order to win the nomination.
[03:37:20.340 --> 03:37:21.500]  That's what we're seeing, Alex.
[03:37:21.500 --> 03:37:22.820]  We're seeing that.
[03:37:22.820 --> 03:37:26.340]  If we look at what he's been saying about NAFTA, about what they've been saying about
[03:37:26.340 --> 03:37:27.340]  it, he was actually...
[03:37:27.340 --> 03:37:29.660]  Yeah, the headline is globalists take over the Libertarian Party.
[03:37:29.660 --> 03:37:30.660]  It's happened.
[03:37:30.660 --> 03:37:31.660]  Yes.
[03:37:31.660 --> 03:37:32.660]  Yes.
[03:37:32.660 --> 03:37:33.660]  And that's the whole thing.
[03:37:33.660 --> 03:37:34.660]  We've had...
[03:37:34.660 --> 03:37:35.660]  And by the way, Gary Johnson is showing himself as a total sleeper cell operative.
[03:37:35.660 --> 03:37:36.660]  Yes.
[03:37:36.660 --> 03:37:41.220]  At the top of the Republican and the Democrat parties, we've mentioned so many times it
[03:37:41.220 --> 03:37:44.860]  is a single party, and they are working towards globalism.
[03:37:44.860 --> 03:37:45.860]  They have a common goal.
[03:37:45.860 --> 03:37:48.780]  If you look at the elitist in the Republican Party that hate Donald Trump so much, why
[03:37:48.780 --> 03:37:49.780]  is it?
[03:37:49.780 --> 03:37:52.380]  It's because it's nationalism versus globalism.
[03:37:52.380 --> 03:37:57.700]  And now we see these globalists have now taken over and assimilated into the Borg, the Libertarian
[03:37:57.700 --> 03:37:58.700]  Party.
[03:37:58.700 --> 03:37:59.700]  That's why I'm so concerned about that.
[03:37:59.700 --> 03:38:01.900]  It used to be a party that stood for individual liberty.
[03:38:01.900 --> 03:38:03.700]  Now it stands for globalism.
[03:38:03.700 --> 03:38:07.940]  Actually, coming out and saying there's absolutely nothing criminal in Hillary Clinton's email
[03:38:07.940 --> 03:38:08.940]  use.
[03:38:08.940 --> 03:38:12.060]  Seriously, I mean, can anybody truly believe that?
[03:38:12.060 --> 03:38:13.940]  I mean, Camille Poglia doesn't believe it.
[03:38:13.940 --> 03:38:18.700]  Nobody who looks at this, even if they have a different political view than we do, even
[03:38:18.700 --> 03:38:22.420]  Democrats don't believe that Hillary Clinton's emails are legitimate.
[03:38:22.420 --> 03:38:24.620]  The Libertarians always get ignored.
[03:38:24.620 --> 03:38:25.820]  They've done a great job overall.
[03:38:25.820 --> 03:38:32.940]  I've been one in intellectual alliance, not in the party itself, in its whole apparatus.
[03:38:32.940 --> 03:38:36.620]  And now that the system might want to use them as a spoiler, they're like, oh, be part
[03:38:36.620 --> 03:38:37.620]  of us.
[03:38:37.620 --> 03:38:38.620]  Join us.
[03:38:38.620 --> 03:38:39.620]  Join us.
[03:38:39.620 --> 03:38:40.620]  Let us be part of the establishment.
[03:38:40.620 --> 03:38:41.620]  Yeah.
[03:38:41.620 --> 03:38:46.460]  While the establishment sinks into obscurity and begins its decadent implosion.
[03:38:46.460 --> 03:38:50.180]  Now, bringing John Harmon in, you're absolutely right.
[03:38:50.180 --> 03:38:55.660]  You talk about a Harvard mafia, Saudi Arabian mafia, Chinese mafia.
[03:38:55.660 --> 03:38:59.020]  There's all these big special interests, all of them.
[03:38:59.020 --> 03:39:01.260]  I don't want special interest running my life.
[03:39:01.260 --> 03:39:07.780]  And almost all these special interests work together to have tyrannical control because
[03:39:07.780 --> 03:39:12.660]  they want a centralized system of levers they control to get more power.
[03:39:12.660 --> 03:39:14.180]  That's why they all behave the same.
[03:39:14.180 --> 03:39:18.260]  I don't care if it's Chinese or Jewish or Saudi Arabian.
[03:39:18.260 --> 03:39:22.260]  I abhor all of these lobbies that are centralized in control.
[03:39:22.260 --> 03:39:26.020]  These are just corrupt interests from all these different countries and groups.
[03:39:26.020 --> 03:39:29.700]  And that's how they control us and divide and conquer, always saying it's one group
[03:39:29.700 --> 03:39:30.700]  or the other is the problem.
[03:39:30.700 --> 03:39:33.700]  If you just got rid of this group, that'd fix everything.
[03:39:33.700 --> 03:39:40.540]  Instead of having a moral informed, involved populist that is allowed to engage in free
[03:39:40.540 --> 03:39:46.380]  association, then the best music, the best art, the best science, the best culture, whether
[03:39:46.380 --> 03:39:52.420]  it's Jimi Hendrix or whether it's Ludwig von Beethoven will rise to the top.
[03:39:52.420 --> 03:39:57.580]  Whether it's a deaf German man or a young black man who was in Vietnam, their art will
[03:39:57.580 --> 03:40:00.940]  rise to the top because the human spirit resonates with it.
[03:40:00.940 --> 03:40:04.660]  And political correctness is whether it's Nazi or whether it's social justice warrior
[03:40:04.660 --> 03:40:10.180]  is about orthodoxy under one stricture code thought.
[03:40:10.180 --> 03:40:16.340]  And if you just eradicate some group racially, then you'll have total power and total control
[03:40:16.340 --> 03:40:18.020]  in this great, wonderful heaven.
[03:40:18.020 --> 03:40:20.860]  Now I want to go to Josh and Eric and Jeff and Chris, but I'm going to hand the baton
[03:40:20.860 --> 03:40:25.100]  briefly to finish up the broadcast today, but tonight is making great points here today.
[03:40:25.100 --> 03:40:30.740]  In overdrive here in the fourth hour, let's now go to John Harmon, who I rarely hear jump
[03:40:30.740 --> 03:40:31.740]  in.
[03:40:31.740 --> 03:40:34.860]  I mean, I'd be once a year, I tell him, come on, my good friend of 15 years, John Harmon
[03:40:34.860 --> 03:40:35.860]  up there.
[03:40:35.860 --> 03:40:37.260]  John, you wanted to pop in about this guy.
[03:40:37.260 --> 03:40:38.260]  Absolutely.
[03:40:38.260 --> 03:40:41.620]  I was just chopping at the bit because a lot of these callers that call in and they're
[03:40:41.620 --> 03:40:44.300]  quote, you know, haters disagree with you.
[03:40:44.300 --> 03:40:48.660]  He called in, said he disagreed with everything, didn't make one point about actually disagreeing
[03:40:48.660 --> 03:40:50.740]  with a specific topic.
[03:40:50.740 --> 03:40:51.740]  They always do that.
[03:40:51.740 --> 03:40:55.660]  They always make it about you and that your own and bought and paid for that you are bad
[03:40:55.660 --> 03:40:58.180]  for making money.
[03:40:58.180 --> 03:41:04.140]  They don't know the difference between network, local ads and, you know, national ads.
[03:41:04.140 --> 03:41:08.020]  It's just, you know, we gave him plenty of time.
[03:41:08.020 --> 03:41:11.500]  He didn't say anything and he didn't actually make one point.
[03:41:11.500 --> 03:41:12.500]  He just attacked her guests.
[03:41:12.500 --> 03:41:17.500]  He attacked you and then he said he didn't attack, then he said he didn't attack Nichols.
[03:41:17.500 --> 03:41:18.500]  Yeah.
[03:41:18.500 --> 03:41:20.980]  And then he claimed he didn't do that, but you can always tell.
[03:41:20.980 --> 03:41:24.300]  There's a tell with these guys is because they always attack the messenger.
[03:41:24.300 --> 03:41:26.220]  They never attacked the information.
[03:41:26.220 --> 03:41:27.220]  I mean, bottom line.
[03:41:27.220 --> 03:41:29.340]  You could, he could sit on air for all hour.
[03:41:29.340 --> 03:41:34.700]  He would just sit and really, it's all about how in his mother's basement, he's a bigger
[03:41:34.700 --> 03:41:35.700]  man than me.
[03:41:35.700 --> 03:41:36.700]  Exactly.
[03:41:36.700 --> 03:41:39.340]  And he's like, Hey guys, can you, can you believe this guy?
[03:41:39.340 --> 03:41:40.340]  Can you believe this guy?
[03:41:40.340 --> 03:41:44.340]  As if he's talking to a crowd of people because he's applying to those, that small crowd out
[03:41:44.340 --> 03:41:45.340]  there.
[03:41:45.340 --> 03:41:46.340]  Yeah.
[03:41:46.340 --> 03:41:50.820]  He wants to go over to some website and have them go look at Bobby or whatever his name
[03:41:50.820 --> 03:41:51.820]  is.
[03:41:51.820 --> 03:41:52.820]  He did a really good job.
[03:41:52.820 --> 03:42:00.740]  My education plan was there's just another gang, just a group of thugs come up and threaten
[03:42:00.740 --> 03:42:05.580]  you and they can't believe when you say, all right, let's go right now.
[03:42:05.580 --> 03:42:10.020]  Same thing with black racist gangs, you know, would, would start a fight with me.
[03:42:10.020 --> 03:42:12.620]  I was like, boy, this, you know, want me to be your Huckleberry.
[03:42:12.620 --> 03:42:13.620]  I'm ready.
[03:42:13.620 --> 03:42:14.620]  I can't handle it.
[03:42:14.620 --> 03:42:15.620]  I freak out.
[03:42:15.620 --> 03:42:18.340]  I panic forward and attack you like an insane creature.
[03:42:18.340 --> 03:42:22.140]  When I'm surrounded by overwhelming odds, I go nuts and these people just don't get
[03:42:22.140 --> 03:42:23.140]  it.
[03:42:23.140 --> 03:42:24.140]  I'm not here to be bullied by you anymore.
[03:42:24.140 --> 03:42:25.140]  It's over.
[03:42:25.140 --> 03:42:27.620]  Whether you're a black group or a KKK, go to hell.
[03:42:27.620 --> 03:42:28.620]  I'm done.
[03:42:28.620 --> 03:42:29.620]  Period.
[03:42:29.620 --> 03:42:30.780]  You don't intimidate me.
[03:42:30.780 --> 03:42:31.780]  Hillary does it.
[03:42:31.780 --> 03:42:32.780]  None of them do.
[03:42:32.780 --> 03:42:33.780]  I don't care what you do to me.
[03:42:33.780 --> 03:42:34.780]  I can't help it.
[03:42:34.780 --> 03:42:35.780]  I'm coming for you.
[03:42:35.780 --> 03:42:36.780]  Period.
[03:42:36.780 --> 03:42:40.260]  And just like David was saying, he's known you for, I think he said four years.
[03:42:40.260 --> 03:42:42.300]  I know you for about 15 years.
[03:42:42.300 --> 03:42:43.780]  You're totally independent.
[03:42:43.780 --> 03:42:49.140]  Um, you know, you, I've never seen you take money from some shady outfit or anything.
[03:42:49.140 --> 03:42:50.140]  I mean, you've heard.
[03:42:50.140 --> 03:42:52.140]  You're totally.
[03:42:52.140 --> 03:42:53.140]  Offer me to go to DC.
[03:42:53.140 --> 03:42:54.140]  Yep.
[03:42:54.140 --> 03:42:55.140]  Trying to recruit you.
[03:42:55.140 --> 03:42:58.460]  Um, and you just know, uh, you're your own man.
[03:42:58.460 --> 03:43:01.300]  You're just a guy on the radio trying to figure it out just like everyone else.
[03:43:01.300 --> 03:43:02.300]  So everyone calling in.
[03:43:02.300 --> 03:43:03.300]  Well, God bless you, John.
[03:43:03.300 --> 03:43:04.300]  For that.
[03:43:04.300 --> 03:43:07.100]  But the point is, is it so are you and so are most people.
[03:43:07.100 --> 03:43:08.100]  They're good people.
[03:43:08.100 --> 03:43:11.620]  We just never get in a position, but the internet's allowed normal people to get a position.
[03:43:11.620 --> 03:43:14.100]  There's lots of people like me or you or David Knight.
[03:43:14.100 --> 03:43:16.140]  David Knight, you know, has been watching the show for a decade.
[03:43:16.140 --> 03:43:17.140]  He's been here for four years.
[03:43:17.140 --> 03:43:21.580]  He didn't even win the contest, but when we did reporter hiring, he, he, you know, he's
[03:43:21.580 --> 03:43:22.580]  done a great job.
[03:43:22.580 --> 03:43:23.580]  He's here, moved his family here.
[03:43:23.580 --> 03:43:25.260]  I'm so honored by it.
[03:43:25.260 --> 03:43:31.020]  But again, exactly change the subject away from the topics.
[03:43:31.020 --> 03:43:35.540]  Hey, they're trying to start an internet ID and tax the internet restrict speech.
[03:43:35.540 --> 03:43:36.540]  Here's the document.
[03:43:36.540 --> 03:43:37.540]  Let's stop it.
[03:43:37.540 --> 03:43:38.540]  Shut up.
[03:43:38.540 --> 03:43:41.700]  You're working for the Jews and I'm just like, okay, let's just say I work for them
[03:43:41.700 --> 03:43:43.620]  so you can feel official and powerful.
[03:43:43.620 --> 03:43:46.060]  Can we move on and defend free speech now?
[03:43:46.060 --> 03:43:47.860]  Thank you, John Harmon for your great points.
[03:43:47.860 --> 03:43:50.260]  Let's go back to David Knight and I'm going to go to these calls, David.
[03:43:50.260 --> 03:43:51.260]  Yeah, Alex.
[03:43:51.260 --> 03:43:54.500]  That's a hallmark of the federal trolls, you know, when they come in and they make it
[03:43:54.500 --> 03:43:57.220]  about the silly side issues like that.
[03:43:57.220 --> 03:43:58.500]  He really doesn't have anything to say.
[03:43:58.500 --> 03:44:00.300]  And as I pointed out, I grew up in the South.
[03:44:00.300 --> 03:44:05.340]  I've seen that kind of nonsense before and I just don't even want to talk about that.
[03:44:05.340 --> 03:44:07.180]  There's so much that we need to talk about.
[03:44:07.180 --> 03:44:08.180]  You grew up in the South.
[03:44:08.180 --> 03:44:12.100]  Did you ever have the like clan come up as you were at a dance with a good looking girl
[03:44:12.100 --> 03:44:13.700]  or something to get in your face?
[03:44:13.700 --> 03:44:18.300]  No, they never bothered me, but I've seen the way they operate and I don't have any
[03:44:18.300 --> 03:44:19.300]  patience for it.
[03:44:19.300 --> 03:44:20.300]  And I don't even want to talk about it.
[03:44:20.300 --> 03:44:23.220]  And of course, he starts out by saying, well, I know you're going to attack me at hominem
[03:44:23.220 --> 03:44:26.580]  and mentions that several times and all he does is an ad hominem attack on you.
[03:44:26.580 --> 03:44:27.900]  He doesn't talk about any issues.
[03:44:27.900 --> 03:44:29.500]  We can talk about issues.
[03:44:29.500 --> 03:44:33.180]  I've been talking about issues with the libertarian party and talk about how, you know, we've
[03:44:33.180 --> 03:44:34.180]  been libertarian.
[03:44:34.180 --> 03:44:35.740]  We agree with liberty.
[03:44:35.740 --> 03:44:39.340]  We want to hold that up as the most important thing that is out there.
[03:44:39.340 --> 03:44:41.300]  I actually worked in the libertarian party.
[03:44:41.300 --> 03:44:46.660]  I hate to see things that I worked toward being taken over by the globalist establishment.
[03:44:46.660 --> 03:44:47.820]  And that's what's going on here.
[03:44:47.820 --> 03:44:50.580]  We had Gary Johnson say, Hey, I want welled because he's connected.
[03:44:50.580 --> 03:44:51.580]  You're darn right.
[03:44:51.580 --> 03:44:52.580]  He's connected.
[03:44:52.580 --> 03:44:56.460]  He's connected to the globalist, to the Northeast establishment globalist, and we got a lot
[03:44:56.460 --> 03:44:57.460]  of evidence about this.
[03:44:57.460 --> 03:44:58.460]  I'll say this.
[03:44:58.460 --> 03:44:59.460]  I've had Johnson in studio.
[03:44:59.460 --> 03:45:04.500]  I've been here for many years and he creeps me out bet.
[03:45:04.500 --> 03:45:08.220]  He's very robotic, very chameleon.
[03:45:08.220 --> 03:45:11.300]  And I don't ever want Gary Johnson back on again quite frankly, because I don't want
[03:45:11.300 --> 03:45:12.300]  to just get some money on.
[03:45:12.300 --> 03:45:13.300]  So it's a newsmaking.
[03:45:13.300 --> 03:45:14.300]  I don't want to be around it.
[03:45:14.300 --> 03:45:18.180]  Well, the problem I had with him when he was running four years ago was the issues that
[03:45:18.180 --> 03:45:19.180]  he chose.
[03:45:19.180 --> 03:45:23.220]  He chose to put at the forefront of his campaign, abortion and gay marriage.
[03:45:23.220 --> 03:45:25.580]  Now, those are not issues that all libertarians agree upon.
[03:45:25.580 --> 03:45:26.580]  Okay.
[03:45:26.580 --> 03:45:28.580]  A lot of people, there's still a lot of disagreement about it.
[03:45:28.580 --> 03:45:29.580]  It's a football issue.
[03:45:29.580 --> 03:45:30.580]  It's a state issue.
[03:45:30.580 --> 03:45:31.580]  Exactly.
[03:45:31.580 --> 03:45:34.020]  And he made those, when you say marriage, a libertarian position as a government shouldn't
[03:45:34.020 --> 03:45:36.940]  be involved in marriage, not promoting or pushing anything.
[03:45:36.940 --> 03:45:41.800]  But now he's gone even farther saying that you ought to be able to put small business
[03:45:41.800 --> 03:45:45.460]  bakers out of business so they don't bake the cake for your gay wedding.
[03:45:45.460 --> 03:45:48.060]  And then in the debate, they put it a different way.
[03:45:48.060 --> 03:45:52.020]  They said, should Nazis be able to force Jewish bakers to make a Nazi cake?
[03:45:52.020 --> 03:45:53.020]  Why?
[03:45:53.020 --> 03:45:54.020]  Certainly.
[03:45:54.020 --> 03:45:56.180]  He has no respect for private property.
[03:45:56.180 --> 03:46:01.660]  He has no understanding of where you draw the line when rights collide and he wants
[03:46:01.660 --> 03:46:03.940]  to use government as a coercive nature.
[03:46:03.940 --> 03:46:04.940]  Okay.
[03:46:04.940 --> 03:46:05.940]  Absolutely.
[03:46:05.940 --> 03:46:10.140]  And again, this is going to happen as he dominates and they're forced to do it.
[03:46:10.140 --> 03:46:13.460]  But Paul Ryan says he's voting for Donald Trump.
[03:46:13.460 --> 03:46:15.340]  Donald Trump is like an evil toad in that photo.
[03:46:15.340 --> 03:46:16.340]  I don't mean that meanly.
[03:46:16.340 --> 03:46:19.020]  I look like a toad too, but maybe he looks like a toad.
[03:46:19.020 --> 03:46:21.260]  But I'm going to be watching Trump.
[03:46:21.260 --> 03:46:25.220]  And if he starts going sideways, folks, I'm going to expose it.
[03:46:25.220 --> 03:46:31.300]  But I want to be politically there in the center covering it, not part of the system,
[03:46:31.300 --> 03:46:37.140]  but in the center of it so I can surveil it all and really be able to credibly cover
[03:46:37.140 --> 03:46:38.980]  what's happening and unfolding with Trump.
[03:46:38.980 --> 03:46:43.460]  But my gut tells me Trump is overall good at a nationalist, even though he can go in
[03:46:43.460 --> 03:46:46.700]  the white horse direction, you know, a little bit of a Napoleonic issue.
[03:46:46.700 --> 03:46:47.780]  I don't mean because he's short.
[03:46:47.780 --> 03:46:51.940]  He's not short, but you know, he's got some problems, but yeah, he scares them in the
[03:46:51.940 --> 03:46:55.700]  calculus because he is a nationalist and he doesn't want to wreck the country.
[03:46:55.700 --> 03:46:57.300]  I mean, he just isn't out to get us.
[03:46:57.300 --> 03:46:59.060]  He's promoted some authoritarian ideas.
[03:46:59.060 --> 03:47:00.060]  That's for sure.
[03:47:00.060 --> 03:47:06.020]  I believe this is about the issue of nationalism versus globalism because if you lose the nationalism,
[03:47:06.020 --> 03:47:09.900]  you lose your bill of rights, you lose your command base, you lose your country, you're
[03:47:09.900 --> 03:47:12.500]  screwed because, you know, the globalist, it's like a spaceship.
[03:47:12.500 --> 03:47:16.300]  And the founders of this country and libertarians have always understood that the antithesis
[03:47:16.300 --> 03:47:20.140]  to individual liberty is state control and it's harder to control it as it gets farther
[03:47:20.140 --> 03:47:21.140]  and larger.
[03:47:21.140 --> 03:47:22.140]  Exactly.
[03:47:22.140 --> 03:47:23.140]  Our whole Declaration of Independence is about that.
[03:47:23.140 --> 03:47:24.140]  Exactly.
[03:47:24.140 --> 03:47:25.140]  Let's go to Josh in Texas.
[03:47:25.140 --> 03:47:26.140]  Josh from here with David Knight.
[03:47:26.140 --> 03:47:27.140]  Go ahead.
[03:47:27.140 --> 03:47:31.580]  Mr. Jones, Mr. Knight, pleasure to be on air with you all, longtime listener, first-time
[03:47:31.580 --> 03:47:35.060]  caller, just a touch base real quick from the last caller.
[03:47:35.060 --> 03:47:39.140]  I mean, people who, I mean, are trying to criticize you all for selling products and
[03:47:39.140 --> 03:47:40.140]  stuff.
[03:47:40.140 --> 03:47:42.140]  I mean, how are you supposed to fund, you know, a huge operation?
[03:47:42.140 --> 03:47:43.140]  Like, are you supposed to sell a dinner place?
[03:47:43.140 --> 03:47:44.140]  I mean, give me a break.
[03:47:44.140 --> 03:47:45.140]  Well, the Nazis are national socialists.
[03:47:45.140 --> 03:47:47.140]  So, yeah, I mean, I think y'all do a great job.
[03:47:47.140 --> 03:47:48.140]  I mean, I really appreciate it.
[03:47:48.140 --> 03:47:49.140]  Well, absolutely.
[03:47:49.140 --> 03:47:56.140]  I mean, I started out 21 years ago as an access TV host and then I have sat down with
[03:47:56.140 --> 03:48:01.660]  him and then I have sat there and just slowly funded and ratcheted up our resistance and
[03:48:01.660 --> 03:48:06.300]  noticed for the bang for the buck, we just now have stratospheric success.
[03:48:06.300 --> 03:48:07.380]  And so I have a responsibility.
[03:48:07.380 --> 03:48:09.860]  I don't want to grow this place, but I've got to.
[03:48:09.860 --> 03:48:14.260]  I've got to do the full resistance or my bones won't let me do it.
[03:48:14.260 --> 03:48:15.260]  I mean, do people get that?
[03:48:15.260 --> 03:48:17.620]  I cannot not, I cannot back down.
[03:48:17.620 --> 03:48:22.220]  I just, my gut, my heart, my spirit says you will take on the new world order.
[03:48:22.220 --> 03:48:24.100]  You will interview the guests that are dangerous.
[03:48:24.100 --> 03:48:26.340]  You will go out in public with no security.
[03:48:26.340 --> 03:48:27.340]  You will be aggressive.
[03:48:27.340 --> 03:48:28.340]  You will do this.
[03:48:28.340 --> 03:48:29.340]  And so I'm doing it.
[03:48:29.340 --> 03:48:32.620]  But again, we've changed the subject, not to internet censorship you're calling in about,
[03:48:32.620 --> 03:48:33.620]  but to Alex Jones.
[03:48:33.620 --> 03:48:34.620]  Okay.
[03:48:34.620 --> 03:48:39.060]  Alex Jones goes to Timbuktu tomorrow, okay, or I'd, you know, die in a freak ballooning
[03:48:39.060 --> 03:48:44.180]  accident or whatever, randomly, hypothetically, whatever a meteorite hits me.
[03:48:44.180 --> 03:48:45.620]  What about the internet censorship?
[03:48:45.620 --> 03:48:46.620]  What about them coming after us?
[03:48:46.620 --> 03:48:47.620]  Go ahead, Josh.
[03:48:47.620 --> 03:48:48.620]  Um, okay.
[03:48:48.620 --> 03:48:52.820]  So I just want to share a story with the audience, you know, a story that I just got from my
[03:48:52.820 --> 03:48:55.220]  buddy on Tuesday a couple of days ago.
[03:48:55.220 --> 03:48:58.740]  And um, you know, I was completely unaware of this kind of, kind of stuff was going on.
[03:48:58.740 --> 03:49:02.340]  I'm assuming a lot of the audiences as well, I'll just jump right in.
[03:49:02.340 --> 03:49:06.660]  Um, my buddy told me that, you know, he'd spent all day on the phone with this cable
[03:49:06.660 --> 03:49:07.660]  provider.
[03:49:07.660 --> 03:49:13.860]  Basically what he did was he downloaded a torn file and the cable, the, probably the
[03:49:13.860 --> 03:49:17.540]  production companies, you know, like Sony, all these, you know, big production companies,
[03:49:17.540 --> 03:49:21.620]  you know, they tracked his IP address down to where he lives.
[03:49:21.620 --> 03:49:27.620]  He got an email from AT&T saying that his, you know, service was cut off.
[03:49:27.620 --> 03:49:32.100]  Um, they apparently sent the email to an email address that wasn't associated with the account.
[03:49:32.100 --> 03:49:35.260]  So he had no idea his internet was just cut off.
[03:49:35.260 --> 03:49:36.260]  Sure.
[03:49:36.260 --> 03:49:37.260]  Sure.
[03:49:37.260 --> 03:49:38.260]  Let's go further.
[03:49:38.260 --> 03:49:39.260]  They're now making multinational agreements.
[03:49:39.260 --> 03:49:40.260]  This is all admitted.
[03:49:40.260 --> 03:49:44.500]  Remember John McCain wanted to be able to blow your computer up by remote, fry it 10 years
[03:49:44.500 --> 03:49:46.460]  ago, about 10 years ago.
[03:49:46.460 --> 03:49:49.460]  And yeah, that's what this whole TPP that we couldn't see does.
[03:49:49.460 --> 03:49:51.420]  So now it's censorship, it's control.
[03:49:51.420 --> 03:49:53.340]  You can argue piracy is wrong.
[03:49:53.340 --> 03:49:57.580]  I tend to think, you know, at certain levels it's out of control, but hey, whatever.
[03:49:57.580 --> 03:49:59.580]  Now they're remotely watching you.
[03:49:59.580 --> 03:50:01.300]  No judge, no jury.
[03:50:01.300 --> 03:50:06.580]  They're turning your service off, uh, lawyers sometimes send us letters and say, your IP
[03:50:06.580 --> 03:50:07.580]  downloaded this.
[03:50:07.580 --> 03:50:11.540]  And it turns out, you know, we didn't, I tell the lawyer go to hell when they ask for $10,000.
[03:50:11.540 --> 03:50:14.600]  But yes, this is part, I'm going to skip this break, this is so important.
[03:50:14.600 --> 03:50:18.300]  This is exactly what we're talking about, David, uh, that this is here.
[03:50:18.300 --> 03:50:24.100]  They're launching the takeover of the internet now, whatever arguments they have, side issue.
[03:50:24.100 --> 03:50:27.220]  The globalists are launching the end of free speech now.
[03:50:27.220 --> 03:50:30.260]  And that tells me they're getting ready to drop the hammer on a bunch of other issues.
[03:50:30.260 --> 03:50:31.260]  David.
[03:50:31.260 --> 03:50:32.940]  Yeah, Alex, you know, we can see this coming yesterday.
[03:50:32.940 --> 03:50:37.580]  I was talking about how the laws, there was this, uh, expose, an article on Drudge talking
[03:50:37.580 --> 03:50:39.700]  about how Congress is passing secret laws.
[03:50:39.700 --> 03:50:43.280]  Well, we've talked for the longest time how we've got this star chamber court in the
[03:50:43.280 --> 03:50:49.460]  FISA court that does these dragnet surveillance orders also says that they're secretly amending
[03:50:49.460 --> 03:50:50.460]  the constitution.
[03:50:50.460 --> 03:50:55.100]  We find out then that the Congress is writing secret laws that we can't even see.
[03:50:55.100 --> 03:50:59.620]  And then we have now the UN is going to be directly setting laws.
[03:50:59.620 --> 03:51:04.760]  We've had the UN agendas like UN agenda 21, which they've now renamed as the 2030 agenda
[03:51:04.760 --> 03:51:06.260]  for sustainable development.
[03:51:06.260 --> 03:51:07.260]  Okay.
[03:51:07.260 --> 03:51:08.660]  Agenda 21 is easier to say.
[03:51:08.660 --> 03:51:10.180]  We still talk about it that way.
[03:51:10.180 --> 03:51:12.060]  The war on drugs was a UN agenda.
[03:51:12.060 --> 03:51:17.020]  Like in 1961, they created the four schedules and put all the drugs into those four schedules
[03:51:17.020 --> 03:51:22.660]  10 years before Richard Nixon copied that agenda verbatim from the UN and said, this
[03:51:22.660 --> 03:51:24.180]  is our war on drugs.
[03:51:24.180 --> 03:51:25.180]  He didn't invent that.
[03:51:25.180 --> 03:51:26.180]  That was a UN agenda.
[03:51:26.180 --> 03:51:33.020]  But now in Europe, they are putting in UN laws and you've got British newspaper saying,
[03:51:33.020 --> 03:51:37.340]  finally, we're going to have self-driving cars because the UN has got a bunch of new
[03:51:37.340 --> 03:51:38.340]  laws.
[03:51:38.340 --> 03:51:40.020]  They're going to directly enact these laws.
[03:51:40.020 --> 03:51:43.300]  Absolutely, they're putting laws in place to make you have robot drivers, to make you
[03:51:43.300 --> 03:51:44.380]  have smart meters.
[03:51:44.380 --> 03:51:46.260]  And then the corporations get the money from it.
[03:51:46.260 --> 03:51:48.100]  That's how the market works now.
[03:51:48.100 --> 03:51:49.900]  We've got to educate the public.
[03:51:49.900 --> 03:51:54.380]  Josh, so again, have your friend send us a copy of it.
[03:51:54.380 --> 03:51:55.820]  We'll black out his name if you want.
[03:51:55.820 --> 03:51:57.820]  We'll do a report on that.
[03:51:57.820 --> 03:51:59.820]  But yes, I'm aware of that going on.
[03:51:59.820 --> 03:52:00.820]  Go ahead.
[03:52:00.820 --> 03:52:05.460]  Also, I'm not condoning or supporting foreign downloading.
[03:52:05.460 --> 03:52:07.140]  That's a whole debate in itself.
[03:52:07.140 --> 03:52:08.140]  I'm not getting into that.
[03:52:08.140 --> 03:52:11.900]  I want to shut it all down and surveil it without warrants to shut our legal and lawful
[03:52:11.900 --> 03:52:12.900]  stuff down.
[03:52:12.900 --> 03:52:13.900]  That's on those as well.
[03:52:13.900 --> 03:52:14.900]  Go ahead.
[03:52:14.900 --> 03:52:15.900]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:52:15.900 --> 03:52:21.940]  And I just feel like this is the slow incremental rollout of the censorship, the policing of
[03:52:21.940 --> 03:52:22.940]  the internet.
[03:52:22.940 --> 03:52:29.100]  And basically what they did was they gave him a packet, first of all, the internet shut
[03:52:29.100 --> 03:52:30.100]  off.
[03:52:30.100 --> 03:52:33.500]  They told him he has to take a test and he has to, you know, they give him like a packet
[03:52:33.500 --> 03:52:38.900]  of 20 to 30 pages material and then give him like a 20, 40 question test.
[03:52:38.900 --> 03:52:42.420]  And they give you the test and you have to take that test before you can get your service
[03:52:42.420 --> 03:52:43.420]  term back on.
[03:52:43.420 --> 03:52:47.620]  Now, through your contract, you still have to pay your service every month, you know,
[03:52:47.620 --> 03:52:48.620]  everything.
[03:52:48.620 --> 03:52:52.820]  I mean, there's no judge, there's no jury, you know, you have to take this test.
[03:52:52.820 --> 03:52:57.820]  He actually said that he didn't pass it, that he got, you know, a 40 out of 100 on it.
[03:52:57.820 --> 03:53:01.580]  And you know, still said, apparently, you know, he said he doesn't think that it matters.
[03:53:01.580 --> 03:53:04.660]  The score you get, you know, it's just, it's just, well, that's what we're announcing in
[03:53:04.660 --> 03:53:09.780]  China and Europe is an internet and basically cyber score index.
[03:53:09.780 --> 03:53:10.780]  No one's debating it.
[03:53:10.780 --> 03:53:12.020]  No one's discussing it.
[03:53:12.020 --> 03:53:13.020]  It's been planned.
[03:53:13.020 --> 03:53:14.900]  It's being rolled out.
[03:53:14.900 --> 03:53:18.420]  And Alex, as part of the trade partnerships that they're putting in the TPP, the Trans
[03:53:18.420 --> 03:53:23.820]  Pacific, also the Transatlantic partnership, the key part of that is control of the internet.
[03:53:23.820 --> 03:53:29.820]  And just this last week, we had Obama in Vietnam with two Hispanic, young Hispanic legislators
[03:53:29.820 --> 03:53:34.700]  from Texas, one of them, one of the Castro twins, and you know all about the Castro twins.
[03:53:34.700 --> 03:53:42.220]  This was the congressman who supported the trade promotion authority, the TPA, to speed
[03:53:42.220 --> 03:53:44.820]  these agreements through Congress.
[03:53:44.820 --> 03:53:50.220]  And of course, the other twin brother has been promoted as Hillary Clinton's vice presidential
[03:53:50.220 --> 03:53:51.220]  pick.
[03:53:51.220 --> 03:53:56.380]  He's the guy who's currently secretary of HUD in the feds.
[03:53:56.380 --> 03:54:01.460]  But these two guys, you want to talk about mafia, you want to talk about racism, these
[03:54:01.460 --> 03:54:07.620]  two guys are the spawn of an Hispanic activist who was one of the founders of La Raza.
[03:54:07.620 --> 03:54:09.620]  This is like a bill there.
[03:54:09.620 --> 03:54:13.060]  And again, to the Klan, they sound good to themselves.
[03:54:13.060 --> 03:54:16.740]  And to La Raza and Mecha, they sound reasonable, but it's the exact same stuff, just different
[03:54:16.740 --> 03:54:17.940]  group of people.
[03:54:17.940 --> 03:54:18.940]  Let's go ahead.
[03:54:18.940 --> 03:54:19.940]  Thank you, Josh.
[03:54:19.940 --> 03:54:23.260]  What do we call this just for YouTube, this little last 10 minutes with them?
[03:54:23.260 --> 03:54:24.260]  Because I know this is going on.
[03:54:24.260 --> 03:54:25.260]  It's been in the news.
[03:54:25.260 --> 03:54:30.980]  They say AT&T spying on customers, downloads, I mean, that's what's going on, shutting
[03:54:30.980 --> 03:54:31.980]  off their service.
[03:54:31.980 --> 03:54:32.980]  Boom.
[03:54:32.980 --> 03:54:38.620]  Let's talk to John Colorado saw this jet crash and a fighter pilot testing thing and he didn't
[03:54:38.620 --> 03:54:39.620]  get killed.
[03:54:39.620 --> 03:54:40.620]  That's good news.
[03:54:40.620 --> 03:54:43.420]  And we'll go to him if we have time, but excuse me for holding the longest.
[03:54:43.420 --> 03:54:45.220]  Chris in Georgia, you're on the air.
[03:54:45.220 --> 03:54:46.220]  Go ahead.
[03:54:46.220 --> 03:54:47.220]  Hey, Alex.
[03:54:47.220 --> 03:54:48.220]  How are you?
[03:54:48.220 --> 03:54:49.220]  I'm all right.
[03:54:49.220 --> 03:54:51.700]  I'm sorry I had to hold so long, your phone's hissing.
[03:54:51.700 --> 03:54:52.700]  Go ahead.
[03:54:52.700 --> 03:54:57.540]  You're fine, you're fine, the caller who said you were assigned is just playing that bullshit.
[03:54:57.540 --> 03:55:02.660]  He's probably just jealous of you, but on my question, and it's a statement before a
[03:55:02.660 --> 03:55:03.660]  question.
[03:55:03.660 --> 03:55:05.460]  I got a couple of questions, but let me get started.
[03:55:05.460 --> 03:55:10.460]  Sure, but haters are going to hate, you know, haters are going to hate, that's what the
[03:55:10.460 --> 03:55:11.460]  guy's doing.
[03:55:11.460 --> 03:55:12.460]  Go ahead.
[03:55:12.460 --> 03:55:13.460]  Yes.
[03:55:13.460 --> 03:55:17.460]  He said that the union in our military would take guns this year through martial law because
[03:55:17.460 --> 03:55:19.900]  the constitution would be suspended on the martial law.
[03:55:19.900 --> 03:55:24.300]  So my question to you is, do you think we the people will win or do you think the new
[03:55:24.300 --> 03:55:26.300]  world order will rise and we'll be defeated?
[03:55:26.300 --> 03:55:30.540]  Well, I'm going to jump off, your phone's breaking up, but it's an excellent question.
[03:55:30.540 --> 03:55:33.380]  It doesn't matter if they claim they have it on paper that they can barbeque kids on
[03:55:33.380 --> 03:55:36.660]  the White House lawn, hypothetically.
[03:55:36.660 --> 03:55:40.220]  Just because they say it's martial law, military take the guns, the military's not going to
[03:55:40.220 --> 03:55:41.220]  follow that order.
[03:55:41.220 --> 03:55:44.700]  So I think there's some missing links here in the globalist equation.
[03:55:44.700 --> 03:55:45.700]  David Knight.
[03:55:45.700 --> 03:55:49.500]  Yeah, Alex, I don't know exactly how this is going to shake out.
[03:55:49.500 --> 03:55:53.340]  But I find it very disturbing this article that came out of the Philippines where you've
[03:55:53.340 --> 03:55:58.300]  got the new president there saying he's okay with killing journalists because, you know,
[03:55:58.300 --> 03:56:00.980]  if you're an SOB, he can kill you.
[03:56:00.980 --> 03:56:03.700]  And it's one of the most dangerous place for journalists to be.
[03:56:03.700 --> 03:56:08.500]  But we ought to understand that you remember that movie that we went to see the act of
[03:56:08.500 --> 03:56:10.860]  killing where they were talking about what happened in Malaysia.
[03:56:10.860 --> 03:56:11.860]  We haven't heard too much about that.
[03:56:11.860 --> 03:56:13.940]  I got physically sick after I watched that.
[03:56:13.940 --> 03:56:14.940]  Yes.
[03:56:14.940 --> 03:56:19.460]  And for the people who haven't seen that, these are a bunch of people who, and this was Obama
[03:56:19.460 --> 03:56:23.140] 's father was part of this administration in Malaysia.
[03:56:23.140 --> 03:56:25.540]  They were partnering with the CIA.
[03:56:25.540 --> 03:56:31.340]  We haven't heard about that story in Indonesia because these people are allies of the American
[03:56:31.340 --> 03:56:32.340]  government.
[03:56:32.340 --> 03:56:33.700]  So they haven't really talked about that in America.
[03:56:33.700 --> 03:56:38.580]  But you had these guys who had executed so many people and were bragging about how they
[03:56:38.580 --> 03:56:41.060]  would do these mass executions of people.
[03:56:41.060 --> 03:56:45.460]  And when I saw this guy in the Philippines, this new president talking about how he would
[03:56:45.460 --> 03:56:50.620]  kill journalists if he didn't like him and he's, he's attacked bishops, called them sons
[03:56:50.620 --> 03:56:52.740]  of whores and so forth and so on.
[03:56:52.740 --> 03:56:57.140]  This guy, when I saw that, Alex, it reminded me of that movie.
[03:56:57.140 --> 03:56:58.140]  That's what I thought of.
[03:56:58.140 --> 03:57:02.300]  And that's, we are so close to that because we got a president who grew up in Indonesia
[03:57:02.300 --> 03:57:06.020]  where they were doing that, where they grew up in that culture.
[03:57:06.020 --> 03:57:07.020]  Oh, you're right.
