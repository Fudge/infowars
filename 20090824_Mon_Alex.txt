[00:00.000 --> 00:09.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.680 --> 00:11.180]  You want answers?
[00:11.180 --> 00:12.780]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.780 --> 00:16.920]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:16.920 --> 00:30.760]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:30.760 --> 00:34.040]  We've got John Perkins, Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[00:34.040 --> 00:38.440]  Johnny is coming up in two hours.
[00:38.440 --> 00:40.480]  Talking about the latest developments in the economy
[00:40.480 --> 00:43.280]  and Obama's betrayal of his promises.
[00:43.280 --> 00:45.880]  I talked about this yesterday.
[00:45.880 --> 00:50.480]  A Rasmussen poll shows the lowest ever for Obama
[00:50.480 --> 00:52.800]  and the lowest ever for any president eight months
[00:52.800 --> 00:55.080]  into their administration.
[00:55.080 --> 00:58.840]  This is a meteoric rise and a meteoric drop,
[00:58.840 --> 01:03.920]  like a shooting star down towards the surface of the earth.
[01:03.920 --> 01:06.480]  Barack Obama, 41 points.
[01:06.480 --> 01:08.360]  I want to talk about this.
[01:08.360 --> 01:11.320]  Also, it's finally getting attention out on the internet.
[01:11.320 --> 01:15.360]  I'm proud to say we broke it back on August 6.
[01:15.360 --> 01:18.440]  And now, people are finally noticing
[01:18.440 --> 01:21.920]  that a big international swine flu symposium
[01:21.920 --> 01:26.360]  with government officials that was held over the weekend
[01:26.360 --> 01:31.280]  in Washington, DC, talks about quarantines, lockdowns of cities,
[01:31.280 --> 01:34.480]  mass graves, arresting citizens.
[01:34.480 --> 01:37.720]  The public schools of your child shows any signs of illness,
[01:37.720 --> 01:41.600]  taking them without asking you to a local FEMA center.
[01:41.600 --> 01:43.560]  It's all in there.
[01:43.560 --> 01:54.960]  And Paul Watson just got a new story up on prisonplanet.com.
[01:54.960 --> 01:59.680]  Authorities prepare to seize kids during swine flu pandemic.
[01:59.680 --> 02:02.440]  Kurt Nemo actually wrote a great story on this back on August 6,
[02:02.440 --> 02:05.640]  but the headline, people accuse us
[02:05.640 --> 02:07.360]  of having sensational headlines.
[02:07.360 --> 02:10.400]  Actually, I've talked to my writers and I said, listen,
[02:10.400 --> 02:12.880]  if a document says they're going to take your kids,
[02:12.880 --> 02:14.600]  you might want to put that in the headline.
[02:14.600 --> 02:20.160]  But then, so we've reissued the story with that headline,
[02:20.160 --> 02:23.040]  with the latest info and some background on it,
[02:23.040 --> 02:24.680]  from Paul Watson.
[02:24.680 --> 02:30.160]  Authorities prepare to seize kids during swine flu pandemic.
[02:30.160 --> 02:33.760]  We'll be going over that, and we'll
[02:33.760 --> 02:41.680]  be also taking your phone calls on a whole host of issues.
[02:41.680 --> 02:44.280]  It's also come out in the last week.
[02:44.280 --> 02:46.120]  Governor Ridge and others have admitted
[02:46.120 --> 02:48.840]  that they would issue fake terror alerts for political gain.
[02:48.840 --> 02:50.320]  Now, we already knew this.
[02:50.320 --> 02:52.920]  This is in my film, Road to Terony.
[02:52.920 --> 02:55.400]  It's in martial law.
[02:55.400 --> 02:57.480]  Again, not tooting our horn, just proving
[02:57.480 --> 03:01.960]  that we were right again on every major issue.
[03:01.960 --> 03:04.160]  But now you have Governor Ridge and the Washington Post
[03:04.160 --> 03:05.640]  admitting it, so I want to discuss that.
[03:05.640 --> 03:12.400]  Plus, not just Blackwater, reportedly in FBI filings
[03:12.400 --> 03:15.320]  and federal court filings, not just Blackwater running
[03:15.320 --> 03:17.160]  hit squads worldwide, but hit squads
[03:17.160 --> 03:20.040]  of political enemies of Dick Cheney and others,
[03:20.040 --> 03:29.800]  and underage pedophilia with little girls, wife swapping,
[03:29.800 --> 03:36.560]  just total Sodom and Gomorrah out of the little Christian Eric,
[03:36.560 --> 03:44.680]  the hitman prince, a true villain, if there ever was one,
[03:44.680 --> 03:47.680]  according to all these reports that are coming up.
[03:47.680 --> 03:49.120]  But that's who runs the world.
[03:49.120 --> 03:53.520]  It's a gangster's world where the more ruthless, the more
[03:53.520 --> 03:55.320]  cunning, the more vicious.
[03:55.320 --> 03:56.880]  I mean, these guys all one up each other.
[03:56.880 --> 04:00.520]  That's why, when it's a big New Brzezinski walks into the room,
[04:00.520 --> 04:05.480]  elitist Twitter, because he's a guy that openly writes two books
[04:05.480 --> 04:08.840]  bragging about how he funded Pol Pot to kill 3 million people,
[04:08.840 --> 04:10.680]  or 30% of a country.
[04:10.680 --> 04:12.400]  That's what gets respect.
[04:12.400 --> 04:13.560]  That's value.
[04:13.560 --> 04:17.520]  That's wealth to the elite.
[04:17.520 --> 04:18.480]  That's how they roll.
[04:18.480 --> 04:21.080]  That's why we've got video of J. Rockefeller and Senate
[04:21.080 --> 04:23.760]  hearings literally worshiping.
[04:23.760 --> 04:25.080]  It's going to be in the new film.
[04:25.080 --> 04:36.720]  Literally, literally worshiping, worshiping,
[04:36.720 --> 04:40.040]  John P. Holdren, the eco science scientist,
[04:40.040 --> 04:43.800]  and saying he walks on water, because it was Holdren's plan
[04:43.800 --> 04:48.000]  that was adopted into world law by the shadow world
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.000]  government, the planetary governorship, by the late 1970s.
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.880]  So to him, he's the master architect.
[04:55.880 --> 04:57.200]  It's great respect.
[04:57.200 --> 04:58.080]  They love him.
[04:58.080 --> 04:59.920]  Oh, you're poisoning the water.
[04:59.920 --> 05:01.280]  This is Alex Jones.
[05:01.280 --> 05:03.280]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[05:03.280 --> 05:04.240]  Well, you should.
[05:04.240 --> 05:07.720]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training
[05:07.720 --> 05:08.760]  waiting for you.
[05:08.760 --> 05:09.520]  That's right.
[05:09.520 --> 05:12.840]  You can attend five days of world class gun training
[05:12.840 --> 05:15.440]  at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute
[05:15.440 --> 05:18.120]  and secure a 30 state concealed weapons permit,
[05:18.120 --> 05:19.560]  all for pennies on the dollar.
[05:19.560 --> 05:22.000]  Plus, if you act fast, the millionaire patriot
[05:22.000 --> 05:25.200]  will give you a free Springfield Armory XV pistol
[05:25.200 --> 05:26.880]  in the caliber of your choice.
[05:26.880 --> 05:29.120]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need
[05:29.120 --> 05:31.120]  to be armed and trained to levels that
[05:31.120 --> 05:33.760]  exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[05:33.760 --> 05:35.440]  Front Sight provides such training
[05:35.440 --> 05:38.400]  without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor
[05:38.400 --> 05:39.280]  attitudes.
[05:39.280 --> 05:40.760]  This is real.
[05:40.760 --> 05:41.720]  Don't miss out.
[05:41.720 --> 05:44.640]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course,
[05:44.640 --> 05:48.200]  plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies
[05:48.200 --> 05:48.920]  on the dollar.
[05:48.920 --> 05:50.360]  And get your free handgun.
[05:50.360 --> 05:52.720]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[05:52.720 --> 05:56.400]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com.
[05:56.400 --> 06:00.760]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[06:00.760 --> 06:05.000]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[06:05.000 --> 06:07.920]  In the near future, Earth is dominated
[06:07.920 --> 06:09.920]  by a powerful world government.
[06:09.920 --> 06:12.760]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[06:12.760 --> 06:15.560]  Both their objective being world domination.
[06:15.560 --> 06:18.640]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[06:18.640 --> 06:21.600]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[06:21.600 --> 06:25.480]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity
[06:25.480 --> 06:26.120]  is at hand.
[06:29.120 --> 06:31.760]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan
[06:31.760 --> 06:34.520]  for world government is blown wide open.
[06:34.520 --> 06:37.280]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world
[06:37.280 --> 06:38.400]  order agenda.
[06:38.400 --> 06:40.920]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[06:40.920 --> 06:42.080]  Most people have no idea.
[06:42.080 --> 06:42.920]  They're not after money.
[06:42.920 --> 06:44.200]  They have all the money they need.
[06:44.200 --> 06:45.160]  They're after power.
[06:45.160 --> 06:46.240]  That's their affidavit.
[06:46.240 --> 06:51.040]  Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com
[06:51.040 --> 06:54.960]  or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[06:54.960 --> 06:57.800]  In-game, blueprint for global enslaved.
[06:57.800 --> 07:00.480]  You have been warned.
[07:00.480 --> 07:04.000]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.160]  is the most important factor in maintaining
[07:06.160 --> 07:08.000]  high energy and vibrant health.
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.240]  Most experts agree that the water you drink
[07:10.240 --> 07:12.440]  should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[07:12.440 --> 07:14.920]  Alchivision plasma pH drops combine
[07:14.920 --> 07:17.640]  a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[07:17.640 --> 07:20.480]  Using plasma pH drops is the best way
[07:20.480 --> 07:23.520]  to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid
[07:23.520 --> 07:25.080]  and regain your health and energy.
[07:25.080 --> 07:27.480]  Simply put, 10 drops in the water you drink
[07:27.480 --> 07:29.760]  to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[07:29.760 --> 07:33.120]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste
[07:33.120 --> 07:35.840]  and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[07:35.840 --> 07:39.160]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer
[07:39.160 --> 07:42.760]  cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[07:42.760 --> 07:45.960]  Order your bottle of Alchivision plasma pH drops now
[07:45.960 --> 07:48.320]  by going directly to alchivision.com.
[07:48.320 --> 07:53.320]  That's A-L-K-A-Vision.com or call 269-409-1776.
[07:54.680 --> 07:58.480]  269-409-1776 today.
[08:01.800 --> 08:03.960]  From his Central Texas Command Center
[08:03.960 --> 08:08.400]  deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[08:08.400 --> 08:12.920]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:12.920 --> 08:17.920]  I have been so busy making the film
[08:28.360 --> 08:31.080]  that I haven't produced a trailer.
[08:31.080 --> 08:32.600]  I haven't done any write-ups.
[08:32.600 --> 08:34.320]  I haven't done any pre-promotion.
[08:34.320 --> 08:39.320]  And pre-promotion is 90% of a film.
[08:40.760 --> 08:43.200]  Doesn't matter if I make what many people believe
[08:43.200 --> 08:44.600]  are some of the definitive documentaries
[08:44.600 --> 08:46.560]  on the New World Order, end game,
[08:46.560 --> 08:49.360]  blueprint for global enslavement, terror, storm,
[08:52.160 --> 08:56.640]  road to tyranny, martial law, police stay 2000,
[08:58.920 --> 09:00.800]  the order of death.
[09:00.800 --> 09:05.520]  It doesn't matter because promotion is everything.
[09:07.320 --> 09:09.480]  And I've got a lot of other big projects going on.
[09:09.480 --> 09:10.320]  I'm not whining.
[09:10.320 --> 09:12.280]  I'm just explaining what's going on here.
[09:15.600 --> 09:17.800]  So I'm gonna go ahead and put up some graphics
[09:17.800 --> 09:19.760]  and some of the artwork and some of the covers
[09:19.760 --> 09:21.360]  we're looking at for the film.
[09:21.360 --> 09:26.360]  I'm gonna go ahead and put that up later this afternoon
[09:32.600 --> 09:36.240]  at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[09:36.240 --> 09:40.480]  And I will on air really stream of consciousness
[09:40.480 --> 09:42.520]  because I haven't written anything up yet,
[09:42.520 --> 09:45.840]  break down what the film covers and what it goes over
[09:45.840 --> 09:48.320]  and how it's different from the Obama deception
[09:48.320 --> 09:51.360]  and what the name of the film is.
[09:54.400 --> 09:57.040]  I will do that coming up in 15 minutes
[09:57.960 --> 10:02.720]  or I'll do it at the eight after basically an hour from now.
[10:03.800 --> 10:05.840]  I will break it down and then Paul Watson,
[10:06.880 --> 10:11.880]  Kurt Nemo, whoever wants to can put this out.
[10:12.360 --> 10:17.200]  And we're gonna go ahead, we're gonna go ahead
[10:17.200 --> 10:21.760]  and tomorrow at high noon, one hour into the show,
[10:21.760 --> 10:23.680]  we will launch the trailer.
[10:23.680 --> 10:25.640]  We have a basic trailer done.
[10:25.640 --> 10:28.760]  I will go ahead and release that trailer tomorrow.
[10:34.440 --> 10:39.280]  I also have a Jesse Ventura interview I did last Wednesday
[10:39.280 --> 10:43.240]  and it's already Monday in Los Angeles.
[10:43.240 --> 10:45.240]  Very interesting, very informative.
[10:45.240 --> 10:50.240]  We're gonna play at least part of that tomorrow as well.
[10:54.480 --> 10:58.480]  So that is coming up today and about an hour
[10:58.480 --> 11:01.080]  I will announce the name of the new film
[11:01.080 --> 11:03.280]  and what it covers and what it goes over.
[11:03.280 --> 11:06.520]  And then my guys will do a write up on the film.
[11:06.520 --> 11:11.520]  And I would just ask everybody because it's a team effort
[11:18.680 --> 11:22.640]  here, we reach millions and millions of people every week.
[11:22.640 --> 11:25.120]  We reach tens of millions of people from each film.
[11:26.800 --> 11:31.800]  We are hitting pay dirt in the info war at every level.
[11:33.520 --> 11:34.720]  I mean, every time we get up to bat,
[11:34.720 --> 11:37.400]  we're hitting home runs and grand slams here.
[11:37.400 --> 11:40.440]  It's just that there is more that needs to be done
[11:40.440 --> 11:42.520]  and so I'm not beating myself up.
[11:42.520 --> 11:44.760]  I just realized that time gets away from me
[11:44.760 --> 11:49.760]  and I'm so focused on finishing this film by late September
[11:51.120 --> 11:56.120]  and releasing it in the latter half of October
[11:56.120 --> 12:01.120]  that I will certainly need your help promoting
[12:10.480 --> 12:15.000]  the release of the new film and it will be free.
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.240]  Of course, on YouTube, Google shutdown, Google video,
[12:19.240 --> 12:20.320]  they don't like to upload anymore,
[12:20.320 --> 12:23.240]  but it'll be all over hundreds and hundreds of video sites
[12:24.520 --> 12:25.920]  and we don't just promote it.
[12:25.920 --> 12:28.880]  We encourage it, we love it, we link to it
[12:30.080 --> 12:35.080]  and it will go on pre-sale in late September
[12:35.240 --> 12:37.880]  and whoever orders in the pre-sale,
[12:37.880 --> 12:40.320]  we get it about two weeks after it goes on pre-sale
[12:40.320 --> 12:42.400]  then we have it all packaged up and ready to ship out
[12:42.400 --> 12:43.880]  the day it's released.
[12:43.880 --> 12:45.280]  We even start shipping them out a few days
[12:45.280 --> 12:49.880]  before it's released and it is your purchase of the DVD
[12:49.880 --> 12:52.960]  that makes these films even possible
[12:52.960 --> 12:55.440]  and the folks at prisonplanet.tv
[12:55.440 --> 12:57.320]  that will be able to see it in the highest quality.
[12:57.320 --> 13:00.760]  We're trying to post this new film in true HD
[13:03.440 --> 13:05.360]  for prisonplanet.tv members.
[13:05.360 --> 13:08.760]  We're trying to get some of the older films up in true HD
[13:12.760 --> 13:14.240]  but then there's an issue of capital
[13:14.240 --> 13:16.160]  just to have the people in here to upload it
[13:16.160 --> 13:29.760]  and code it and do it and just God help us, God help us, because I have taken on as much as I can
[13:33.760 --> 13:35.840]  and again, we've had a great impact
[13:35.840 --> 13:39.360]  and that's what's frustrating is that we could have an even bigger impact.
[13:39.360 --> 13:43.520]  Victory is within sight against the new world order.
[13:43.520 --> 13:46.240]  If we believe we can beat them
[13:46.240 --> 13:51.400]  and if we don't replace their world government with some new tyranny
[13:51.400 --> 13:57.440]  and then there is that pre-planned, pre-implanted
[13:57.440 --> 14:01.400]  misanariat protectorate
[14:01.400 --> 14:04.840]  that we're going to lose and the world government's going to come
[14:04.840 --> 14:07.040]  and we're going to be enslaved and
[14:07.040 --> 14:13.720]  it's like a foregone conclusion, a self-fulfilling prophecy
[14:13.720 --> 14:16.520]  and that's the only problem we really face
[14:16.520 --> 14:20.280]  and why is that not a giant complex, huge issue
[14:20.280 --> 14:27.280]  in and of itself?
[14:27.640 --> 14:33.960]  I am absolutely fired up
[14:33.960 --> 14:37.480]  right now.
[14:37.480 --> 14:42.760]  I mean, what do you do? You make films, the radio show suffers. You focus on radio, the films suffer.
[14:42.760 --> 14:47.080]  You focus on films and radio, then you've got your basic human resources, crap,
[14:47.080 --> 14:53.480]  to deal with constantly
[14:53.480 --> 14:57.960]  and everything else
[14:57.960 --> 15:03.920]  and I'm not a perfectionist, I'm far from it. I'm somebody that does launch operations.
[15:03.920 --> 15:07.400]  It's just...
[15:07.400 --> 15:12.240]  I don't know, my plate is so full.
[15:12.240 --> 15:18.040]  So full of information. I have seven stacks of vital off-the-charts
[15:18.040 --> 15:22.920]  news of such import, it makes my head spin
[15:22.920 --> 15:29.920]  and my head is spinning.
[15:29.920 --> 15:34.360]  Oh, my God. Authorities prepare to cease kids during swine flu pandemic.
[15:34.360 --> 15:37.320]  International Swine Flu Summit trains
[15:37.320 --> 15:40.400]  responders to enforce quarantines, mass vaccinations,
[15:40.400 --> 15:45.440]  deal with riots and unrest, as well as mass graves.
[15:45.440 --> 15:49.520]  Authorities, officials, gods, first-class citizens, that's what that word means.
[15:49.520 --> 15:52.400]  Authorities are preparing to cease children from schools and set up
[15:52.400 --> 15:54.160]  quarantines and morgues,
[15:54.160 --> 15:58.880]  conduct mass vaccinations and deal with riots and unrest according to an
[15:58.880 --> 16:01.000]  international swine flu
[16:01.000 --> 16:04.400]  summit recently held in Washington DC
[16:04.400 --> 16:08.520]  which was attended by distinguished scientists, industry leaders and top
[16:08.520 --> 16:12.120]  health officials from all over the globe.
[16:12.120 --> 16:16.120]  A conference first discussed by this website three weeks ago
[16:16.120 --> 16:19.600]  has now taken place with health authorities meeting at the end of
[16:19.600 --> 16:22.000]  last week to finalize
[16:22.000 --> 16:25.280]  response plans to a swine flu pandemic
[16:25.280 --> 16:28.760]  that has been all but guaranteed to occur
[16:28.760 --> 16:33.480]  this coming fall. According to the PDF, information leaflet released before the
[16:33.480 --> 16:35.160]  meeting attendees were briefed
[16:35.160 --> 16:42.200]  on how to conduct morgue operations, manage and
[16:42.200 --> 16:46.360]  the interruption in food,
[16:46.360 --> 16:52.600]  supplies and manage panic caused by sudden disruption of services
[16:52.600 --> 16:55.880]  and interruptions in essential food services.
[16:55.880 --> 16:59.720]  During a swine flu pandemic, their duties would also include dealing with
[16:59.720 --> 17:01.320]  civil disturbances,
[17:01.320 --> 17:04.920]  controlling and defusing social unrest and public disorder,
[17:04.920 --> 17:10.280]  carrying out vaccination programs and enforcing quarantines
[17:10.280 --> 17:13.240]  according to the conference
[17:13.240 --> 17:17.320]  documentation. One of the most shocking
[17:17.320 --> 17:22.600]  modules of the conference deals with schools, universities, pandemic planning
[17:22.600 --> 17:26.760]  and strongly implies that authorities will usurp parental rights over
[17:26.760 --> 17:30.280]  children in the event of swine flu pandemic. Well, it says it'll take your
[17:30.280 --> 17:31.480]  kids and take them to
[17:31.480 --> 17:35.240]  facilities. I mean, yeah, they've always had these drills. That's what they do.
[17:35.240 --> 17:38.600]  Got the Washington Post admitting that during martial law they're going to take
[17:38.600 --> 17:43.560]  your kids and we've videotaped drills where they do just that
[17:43.560 --> 17:47.240]  to quote protect the children from homeschooling militias that are trying to
[17:47.240 --> 17:50.360]  kill them. AP, you can't make this these federal
[17:50.360 --> 17:56.760]  scripts up demonization campaigns. Concurrent breakout session 10 outlines
[17:56.760 --> 18:01.480]  plans to train teachers to screen for symptoms
[18:01.480 --> 18:04.760]  and know what to do when students teachers fall ill
[18:04.760 --> 18:09.160]  before transporting ill students, which presumably means transporting them to
[18:09.160 --> 18:12.680]  quarantine zones, whether we're out the consent of parents.
[18:12.680 --> 18:16.760]  The use of schools as shelters and quarantine centers is also mentioned.
[18:16.760 --> 18:20.920]  Forced inoculations is mentioned. We also documented authorities have been
[18:20.920 --> 18:23.560]  training to raid and remove children from
[18:23.560 --> 18:27.320]  schools during times of emergency for over a decade,
[18:27.320 --> 18:30.840]  mainly under the auspices of preparing for school shootings
[18:30.840 --> 18:36.280]  or during drug sweeps. In October 2001, government goons swooped in and
[18:36.280 --> 18:39.080]  kidnapped and removed 115 children from Heartland
[18:39.080 --> 18:42.200]  Christian Academy without a warrant. Children were forcibly loaded on the
[18:42.200 --> 18:46.360]  buses like criminals as they screamed for help
[18:46.360 --> 18:49.560]  in the shock scene featured in the road to tyranny.
[18:49.560 --> 18:52.840]  Earlier this month we reported on a main high school was
[18:52.840 --> 19:00.120]  taken over by the marines in a drill focused around riots during a mass
[19:00.120 --> 19:04.680]  vaccination program. In the scenario, the rioters were begging
[19:04.680 --> 19:10.200]  to be vaccinated, but obviously the opposite is likely to be the case in a
[19:10.200 --> 19:15.000]  mandatory vaccination program is announced. If there are riots,
[19:15.000 --> 19:18.920]  then this will consist of people refusing to take the shot.
[19:18.920 --> 19:23.960]  A YouTuber posted the following video which covers some of the issues
[19:23.960 --> 19:28.200]  raised by the swine flu conference.
[19:28.920 --> 19:31.800]  In Watson, that's a great article you wrote in 30 minutes, I told him to write
[19:31.800 --> 19:34.920]  that right before the show, but I think it was
[19:34.920 --> 19:39.160]  in Maine, I think it was army, though there have been drills with marines
[19:39.160 --> 19:42.920]  training to quote, put children in FEMA camps
[19:42.920 --> 19:47.000]  under martial law, Hobbs Middle School, Pensacola, Florida.
[19:47.000 --> 19:51.080]  Yeah, that's a National Guard takes over for swine flu riot drill,
[19:51.080 --> 19:54.280]  but there have been marines running checkpoints for drunk drivers and what
[19:54.280 --> 19:57.960]  not. All right, we're gonna come back
[19:57.960 --> 20:02.520]  get into Obama's approval rating. When you hear the words water purification,
[20:02.520 --> 20:06.280]  what comes to mind? If it's burky water purification systems, this
[20:06.280 --> 20:09.800]  message is for you. Did you know that over 60% of municipal
[20:09.800 --> 20:13.240]  water contains fluoride at less than 2 cents per gallon?
[20:13.240 --> 20:16.520]  Burky water filters purify treated and untreated water,
[20:16.520 --> 20:20.360]  remove dangerous chlorine fluoride and contaminants from municipal water.
[20:20.360 --> 20:23.800]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water,
[20:23.800 --> 20:27.480]  making them perfect for rainwater collection systems. From the smallest to
[20:27.480 --> 20:31.320]  the largest systems, BigBurkyWaterFilters.com has what you need.

[20:59.240 --> 21:03.960]  today. In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[21:03.960 --> 21:08.520]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to have a civilian national
[21:08.520 --> 21:12.680]  security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[21:12.680 --> 21:17.400]  just as well funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth
[21:17.400 --> 21:20.760]  that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[21:20.760 --> 21:25.240]  While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[21:25.240 --> 21:28.920]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[21:28.920 --> 21:33.240]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[21:33.240 --> 21:36.760]  bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[21:36.760 --> 21:40.360]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[21:40.360 --> 21:45.320]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told,
[21:45.320 --> 21:49.960]  and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today

[23:00.440 --> 23:04.120]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic
[23:04.120 --> 23:06.760]  and political problems facing the U.S. and the world.
[23:06.760 --> 23:10.600]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.

[23:20.520 --> 23:24.600]  broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish
[23:24.600 --> 23:27.400]  with doubly-nammeled cans and nitrogen packaging.

[23:37.880 --> 23:42.680]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog. We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you,

[24:05.240 --> 24:32.600]  I hurt myself today to see if I still feel I focus on the pain the only thing that's real
[24:32.600 --> 24:48.040]  the needle tears the hole the old familiar stain try to kill it all away
[24:48.040 --> 25:03.960]  but I remember everything what have I become my sweetest friend my sweetest friend
[25:03.960 --> 25:24.280]  everyone I know goes away and you could have it all the empire of dirt my empire
[25:24.280 --> 25:35.240]  dirt I will let you in I will let you down I will make you
[25:36.520 --> 25:43.960]  look let's just do this I've thrown out the news you know Obama is headed towards 40 points he's
[25:43.960 --> 25:50.600]  at 41 right now which has never before been seen eight months into a presidency I mean that's
[25:50.600 --> 25:57.960]  five points lower than the previous record held by Jimmy Carter he that he is absolutely going
[25:57.960 --> 26:05.240]  to stage a terrorist attack or some type of crisis guaranteed unless Barack Obama is the
[26:05.240 --> 26:11.640]  false flag himself unless he was meant to come make all these promises and then just be torn
[26:11.640 --> 26:18.280]  apart politically and then serve as some type of sacrificial political lamb on the altar
[26:18.280 --> 26:25.000]  for the screaming horde to be politically torn a limb from limb I don't know
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.640]  I mean is the false flag the fact of the American people are going to riot over the economy falling
[26:33.640 --> 26:38.440]  apart while the media lies and says everything's wonderful as record unemployment intensifies
[26:38.440 --> 26:45.560]  as record store closures and real estate and commercial real estate and the media just keeps
[26:45.560 --> 26:51.720]  parroting that everything's wonderful and everything's turned around as the 23.7 trillion
[26:51.720 --> 26:59.720]  just in the US alone starts hitting the streets and commodities start going up hyper stag inflation
[27:03.240 --> 27:09.880]  they're trying to use depression on main street to cover the hyper inflation in the currency
[27:09.880 --> 27:16.440]  very bizarre balancing act and it's worked a little bit so far for the establishment to
[27:16.440 --> 27:23.400]  keep their wealth not the people it's wrecking the real economy and I guess that's why I'm so
[27:23.400 --> 27:30.200]  frustrated not in a bad way not in a good way it's just frustrated it's burning I'm burning with
[27:30.200 --> 27:40.520]  with something past desire it's uh I'm seized by it it's just it's past disgust it's past
[27:40.520 --> 27:50.840]  anger it's it's indescribable it's it's I am completely overwhelmed from the tips of my
[27:51.400 --> 27:58.520]  fingers to the depths of my guts from the recesses of my brain to the tips of my toes
[27:58.520 --> 28:08.440]  with wonderment that government is so outrageously corrupt so outrageously evil so outrageously
[28:10.760 --> 28:11.640]  kleptocratic
[28:15.400 --> 28:23.240]  and larceness I mean there's all these big freakouts all over the British and Swedish and Dutch and
[28:23.240 --> 28:31.960]  Israeli news and Benjamin yet and yahoo so upset and angry and how dare the Swedish newspaper show
[28:31.960 --> 28:39.480]  pictures of people that have clearly had their organs removed you know how dare they imply that
[28:39.480 --> 28:42.120]  Israel is killing people and selling their organs
[28:42.120 --> 28:52.920]  it's Sweden's biggest newspaper reporting on over a week ago I finally had time to research it
[28:53.640 --> 29:03.000]  I mean of course us forces contractors have been caught it's in my film martial law made in 2004
[29:03.000 --> 29:13.640]  or about the organ harvesting China has organ harvesting us hospitals by 1992 I remember seeing
[29:13.640 --> 29:21.720]  60 minutes tv shows about it never forget 1992 sitting in my grandfather's house
[29:23.240 --> 29:27.480]  watching 60 minutes with him on sunday we did that when I'd go over there after dinner on sunday
[29:27.480 --> 29:32.360]  sometimes and they were admitting hospitals were killing people in the us for their organs
[29:32.360 --> 29:42.840]  of course israel's taking people's organs but see but see it's more sophisticated the whole world's
[29:42.840 --> 29:53.400]  killing people for organs we'll be right back stay with us we're on the march the empires on the run
[29:53.400 --> 30:04.840]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator

[31:09.480 --> 31:15.560]  uh world order that i think all of us would like to see the obama deception completely destroys the

[35:53.800 --> 36:00.120]  obama plunging on average two points a week this is never before seen this plunge
[36:01.480 --> 36:05.880]  is absolutely terminal let me just tell the globalist something i'm sure they've already
[36:05.880 --> 36:13.080]  figured this out you're gonna fail when you nuke a major city or you start world war three
[36:13.080 --> 36:18.760]  or you release a bio weapon it's not gonna work it's over the people know your criminals and
[36:18.760 --> 36:24.840]  there's nothing you can do to put Humpty Dumpty back together again you know coming up later in
[36:24.840 --> 36:31.560]  the last hour if i have time we actually broke this eight years ago in my local tv show i was
[36:31.560 --> 36:38.040]  sent videos by people inside cnn and that's where this video comes from and then four years ago
[36:38.040 --> 36:43.480]  there's a prison planet article on it and a year ago on it i just point that out with people keep
[36:43.480 --> 36:51.480]  emailing me saying have you seen this have you seen this video of fake cnn broadcast at the start
[36:51.480 --> 36:57.800]  of the gulf war inside a sound studio with the blue screen without the blue screen chroma key
[36:57.800 --> 37:04.840]  turned on with them staging and saying that sarin scud missiles have been launched yes
[37:05.480 --> 37:11.640]  we broke it we know about it and i was digging around last night up here in a bunch of videos
[37:11.640 --> 37:17.000]  but i've got three storage sheds full as well back then it was just really me and one other guy so
[37:17.000 --> 37:23.400]  i didn't chronicle and librarian all this stuff like i was supposed to didn't file it right we
[37:23.400 --> 37:29.080]  also have a dan rather somewhere and this may be on the web i look for it last night and can find it
[37:29.720 --> 37:37.960]  a dan rather fake newscast that people inside cbs leaked later and we didn't break this this was
[37:37.960 --> 37:43.240]  actually played on some local pbs stations around the country i forget the name of it was
[37:43.240 --> 37:50.760]  documentary but this came out in the late nineties like 97 or so showing fake newscast as well with
[37:50.760 --> 37:56.920]  dan rather so that look you think the cnn's bad i can't keep track of all the lies that's my point
[37:58.120 --> 38:03.880]  later in the last hour when we're live at prison planet dot tv i'm going to play the live feeds of
[38:03.880 --> 38:14.360]  cnn doing fake scud attacks okay from the studio that they're not on a roof with palm trees and
[38:14.360 --> 38:19.320]  then we'll cut to behind the scenes video leaked out of cnn where they're sitting around laughing
[38:19.320 --> 38:25.640]  and joking and doing donald duck characters and i mean it's so ridiculous but you look at how low
[38:25.640 --> 38:34.120]  tech this is then we'll flip over to live cnn and how glossy and slick because back then they had
[38:34.120 --> 38:41.800]  journalists who they were ordering to act you understand so it looks like a bad high school
[38:41.800 --> 38:48.760]  play now they've got actors posing as journalists comprende that's what i mean when i say i can't
[38:48.760 --> 38:55.160]  cover it all it's just all insane i think i've mentioned three things in my stack there's probably
[38:55.160 --> 39:02.120]  150 things or more that i've got that are all of the same giant importance it's just all complete
[39:02.120 --> 39:13.480]  fraud god meanwhile the reality is they are poisoning our water and food and i can't help
[39:13.480 --> 39:18.120]  who i am i can't help but fight them and scream at them and yell at them and try to warn people
[39:18.120 --> 39:23.000]  knowing it that they can play dirty tricks or kill me or set me up and i'm not happy about that
[39:23.000 --> 39:27.720]  and then i just think about the idiots that are going to set me up or kill me and i'm like you morons
[39:27.720 --> 39:34.120]  you're under attack by the same crap it's like burning down your own house cutting off your own
[39:34.120 --> 39:41.080]  nose to spite your face it is ridiculous and that's what's so ridiculous about evil we pay taxes
[39:41.080 --> 39:47.880]  to have them put hundreds and hundreds of poisons in our water under the
[39:49.880 --> 39:59.720]  take all name of fluoride we pay to have gmo food we pay more for it we pay to have it filled
[39:59.720 --> 40:07.800]  with fillers and toxins and poisons we pay we pay to have the soaps we use be toxic detergents
[40:07.800 --> 40:15.720]  with all the toxic waste leftovers of oil production dumped into it you we pay to be raped we pay
[40:15.720 --> 40:21.960]  to be scammed it's it's all what that's the trick of evil is that people think it gets them ahead
[40:21.960 --> 40:28.120]  they think they get away with something you don't get anything but hell and death out of evil and
[40:28.120 --> 40:35.080]  i'm not on some preacher high horse here ladies and gentlemen i had a big fat evil streak right
[40:35.080 --> 40:42.280]  down the middle of my back that's why i could see this stuff but i got a lot bigger stripe right
[40:42.280 --> 40:50.440]  down my soul of love and liberty and sweetness and goodness and i just can't stand it anymore i
[40:50.440 --> 40:56.040]  can't stand it anymore it all it all just coming on the show with sponsors and giggling and taking
[40:56.040 --> 41:03.720]  calls and having fun almost does the job for the enemy just kind of calmly talking about all this
[41:03.720 --> 41:12.520]  i get no big deal and i'm so sick of people i mean i notice that the same co-intel pro people will
[41:12.520 --> 41:17.160]  be in hundreds of youtube videos under different fake accounts that are designed to look like real
[41:17.160 --> 41:21.960]  accounts saying the same thing under different names and i just think about those idiots getting
[41:21.960 --> 41:27.960]  corporate money and government money and pentagon money on record to attack me don't you jackasses
[41:27.960 --> 41:35.560]  get it that this is real and this isn't a joke that they you know the joke is i don't care if you
[41:35.560 --> 41:40.520]  make stuff up and try to put doubts in people's minds about me and you know do all the little
[41:40.520 --> 41:50.600]  talking points you follow i don't care about me i care about humanity and i care about you
[41:50.600 --> 41:57.880]  and over the years i've made the mistake of really trying to reach out to enemies and it's
[41:57.880 --> 42:03.800]  just you're always stabbed in the back they just don't care it's just a primitive mindless spiritual
[42:03.800 --> 42:10.360]  blindness and they revel they're sitting there in a stew of their own sess
[42:10.360 --> 42:21.960]  sess just happy loving just rolling around in it and i had just an absolutely instinctive
[42:21.960 --> 42:31.800]  level i just want to just stand up against them i mean here's an example i can't articulate
[42:31.800 --> 42:40.040]  the subtle sophistications and preprogrammed isms and semantical lexicons that are involved
[42:41.160 --> 42:48.440]  because i will come on air and i will expose the protestant church or the catholic church or
[42:49.640 --> 42:56.200]  zionist organizations or masonic organizations and when i attack all those groups i'm not attacking
[42:56.200 --> 43:02.360]  catholics i'm not attacking jews i'm not attacking masons i'm not attacking the bought off protestant
[43:02.360 --> 43:08.760]  church i am pointing out how at the top it's all run by the same system i mean how do you have the
[43:08.760 --> 43:13.000]  evil communist chinese working with the evil us government because they're just criminals it's a
[43:13.000 --> 43:17.400]  criminal class they have the same stinking language of keeping the sheep in the dark
[43:17.400 --> 43:27.400]  and so i got up on air in 2004 2005 and did radio show after radio show and made a film
[43:29.000 --> 43:32.360]  about us forces contractors and israeli forces
[43:34.680 --> 43:40.200]  killing people they tortured to death and then slicing them open and taking their lungs liver
[43:40.200 --> 43:47.560]  heart and kidneys and then even siphoning the blood off fresh so that there's fresh blood
[43:47.560 --> 43:51.720]  for any blood transfusion with the person's blood type it matches and then they fly it
[43:51.720 --> 43:58.200]  into new york and new jersey and california and they fly it into israel and they fly it into china
[43:58.200 --> 44:02.760]  and they fly it into japan i mean where do you think jobs and people like that you know nobody
[44:02.760 --> 44:07.480]  else can get a liver but he magically gets one in tennessee and they've got facilities all over
[44:07.480 --> 44:16.120]  that do this and it's admitted china advertises they have fresh livers they have mobile execution
[44:16.120 --> 44:23.800]  vans china advertises this it's in bbc and times of london but then meanwhile the state
[44:23.800 --> 44:27.400]  department comes out three years ago and says it's all a conspiracy theory none of it exists
[44:28.840 --> 44:34.120]  when previous state department letters decried it because our government is involved 60 minutes
[44:34.120 --> 44:43.160]  it's back in the early 1990s did specials on it i've told the story my dad an oral surgeon
[44:43.160 --> 44:50.200]  rewiring jaws working in hospital sometimes late night he he just said to me when i was going
[44:50.200 --> 44:56.760]  when i was 15 about to get my driver's license he said don't sign the organ donor card and i said
[44:56.760 --> 45:04.760]  why and he said because some hospitals in dallas i've been told by physicians will not render care
[45:04.760 --> 45:11.240]  because they because they'll harvest your organs even if you're not brain dead especially young
[45:11.240 --> 45:17.080]  people and he said don't sign it and i didn't really believe it but i still didn't sign it
[45:17.640 --> 45:24.600]  then years later when i'm like well not just three or four years later i guess was it 92 93
[45:24.600 --> 45:30.200]  i'm sitting there watching 60 minutes were in chicago they were killing people for their organs
[45:30.200 --> 45:38.600]  now i'm the person who made a film about israel involved in organ harvesting okay i'm the first
[45:38.600 --> 45:47.640]  person to talk about it okay so then when i go further and talk about how it's widespread
[45:47.640 --> 45:53.400]  then the government agents will say i'm covering up saying israel isn't involved see and that's just
[45:53.400 --> 45:56.600]  one example of thousands of how disinformation works
[46:00.280 --> 46:06.680]  i saw comments from our article we wrote uh on uh august 6 here's here's another example
[46:08.680 --> 46:10.200]  an article we wrote august 6
[46:12.600 --> 46:19.560]  about this international flu pandemic symposium in dc we broke it as a listener called and sent it
[46:19.560 --> 46:27.160]  to us now it's big news and then it says in that article in the newest one that kurt posted
[46:27.800 --> 46:31.160]  a video somebody talking about it it says in there oh look
[46:34.920 --> 46:42.200]  um alex is lying this doesn't exist because school's already started teachers couldn't
[46:42.200 --> 46:50.360]  be there at the symposium now now see what warped mindless laziness that is instead of
[46:50.360 --> 46:55.400]  researching real information that's how co-intel pro probably co-intel pro works there's no one's
[46:55.400 --> 47:00.440]  really that stupid obviously this isn't regular teachers there this is administrators state
[47:00.440 --> 47:05.160]  administrators that go back and give the total orders that's how this works of course your
[47:05.160 --> 47:12.120]  local teacher isn't there on the 20th most school starts today by the way but it doesn't even
[47:12.120 --> 47:17.560]  see that's even bold but that's what i mean i mean i still got people running around saying
[47:17.560 --> 47:20.360]  i'm lying about fema
[47:24.920 --> 47:29.720]  my god i understand all their information i told you made off with die of cancer months ago on air
[47:29.720 --> 47:34.520]  we don't have the staff to find that he just walked in with roiders made off dying of cancer
[47:34.520 --> 47:39.560]  fellow inmates saying see i just understand everything i understand everything they're
[47:39.560 --> 47:43.800]  doing you understand the torture of this knowing everything they're gonna do how they're gonna do
[47:43.800 --> 47:48.680]  it how their tricks work and i'm not saying i'm smart i don't understand how i know everything
[47:48.680 --> 47:52.360]  they're gonna do did you not hear me over and over again say made off with soon dive cancer
[47:52.920 --> 47:57.240]  i said over and over again and we need to just hire an employee who just marks down my predictions
[47:57.240 --> 48:01.800]  it's out man almost broke my hand earlier when i was slamming into the i just can't do it anymore
[48:03.320 --> 48:06.520]  they are poisoning your water they are killing you it is real
[48:06.520 --> 48:15.560]  i just can't handle it i mean i literally i i i just it's it's i can't sit here calmly
[48:15.560 --> 48:21.720]  while all this is going on acting like it's not that big of a deal i am legitimately freaked out i
[48:21.720 --> 48:27.160]  can't handle it anymore i don't understand why we have to be part of this evil i don't understand
[48:27.160 --> 48:36.280]  why this evil has to go on just because as much as i've told you i can't even begin to
[48:36.280 --> 48:41.320]  explain what i know i just know everything they're going to do i don't know how i know it
[48:43.640 --> 48:46.760]  it's just all i do is study these people it's it's sickening
[48:51.160 --> 48:58.360]  that's what i mean i going back to the israel thing the point is is that i i have to come on
[48:58.360 --> 49:03.960]  air and talk about israel and organ harvesting i have to tell the truth i have to talk about
[49:03.960 --> 49:10.360]  issues like that okay just like i talked about china doing it and just like i talked about
[49:10.360 --> 49:16.360]  us hospitals doing it so see i have to come on air and talk about israel doing it even though
[49:16.360 --> 49:20.440]  i don't want to be demonized and attacked by the media as being you know anti-semitic which
[49:20.440 --> 49:25.560]  isn't true but they use that label but then i've got to be intellectually honest and go
[49:25.560 --> 49:32.680]  by the way this isn't just israel this is this corruption is from china to japan to the united
[49:32.680 --> 49:39.480]  states and yes israel's running a ring into new jersey of course they're people they shoot or kill
[49:39.480 --> 49:43.800]  of course they're taking them and harvesting their organs that's a big part of why the forces are
[49:43.800 --> 49:51.240]  in iraq i mean they take them out of abu grahi by the hundreds zippered from their chin down to their
[49:52.600 --> 49:59.320]  private parts they open them up and they take the organs out they do it as quickly as possible
[49:59.320 --> 50:08.200]  well surgically but see if we just make it about israel see why is the media only covering it
[50:08.200 --> 50:13.480]  with israel because see then they can make it an anti-semitic issue to talk about the organs
[50:13.480 --> 50:18.280]  but if we come out and say everybody's doing it which is the truth then people will finally have
[50:18.280 --> 50:23.800]  a paradigm shift and realize we have a culture a class of criminals that are chinese jewish
[50:23.800 --> 50:31.560]  german all over the place working together to do this but see you don't see it in the
[50:32.120 --> 50:37.880]  major news about how governments worldwide are doing it see that's even more frightening
[50:37.880 --> 50:43.960]  because the truth is always stranger than fiction so see i'm i'm trailblazing exposing israel
[50:43.960 --> 50:50.360]  for false flag terror for uss liberty but then when i point out oh and the us government was
[50:50.360 --> 50:55.960]  involved with israel then it's supposedly covering up for israel when it isn't it's
[50:55.960 --> 51:02.760]  exposing the entire paradigm you understand e-cigarettes national dot com would like to

[1:08:19.640 --> 1:08:25.800]  what's happening on the economy all this news coming out about black water and murder for higher
[1:08:25.800 --> 1:08:35.160]  and paedophilia and everything else and fake terror alerts issued by bush and just giant stacks of
[1:08:35.160 --> 1:08:42.120]  important news john perkins confessions of an economic hitman his new book hoodwinked coming
[1:08:42.120 --> 1:08:47.560]  out he's going to be joining us coming up the next hour in the last hour i want to go over some
[1:08:48.200 --> 1:08:53.880]  a whole host of issues but also some cnn video clips of fake news and comparing how
[1:08:53.880 --> 1:09:01.000]  shoddy they're fake news all cia run was back in 1991 compared to now i mean you watch it it's
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:09.080]  glistening it is all just totally actor driven so i want the public to become aware of this
[1:09:10.760 --> 1:09:16.200]  i know you're aware of it at an intellectual level but let it really consciously sink in deep down
[1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:24.200]  okay and cnn it's been the washington post you know they brag about it that generals run it
[1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:29.080]  the pentagon runs it and last night they had the joint chiefs of staff chairman on there just
[1:09:29.080 --> 1:09:33.240]  telling everybody how great afghanistan was and how wonderful it is and big charts and graphs
[1:09:33.240 --> 1:09:38.120]  i mean it's just a total government production now you see femo on tv even locally and its
[1:09:38.120 --> 1:09:43.400]  military officers locally commanding everyone oh hi i'm with the marines i'm with the army
[1:09:43.400 --> 1:09:49.160]  i'm with the air force i run your local town now because we work for offshore banks and we're
[1:09:49.160 --> 1:09:53.480]  going to take everything you got it's real funny how we conquered you too
[1:09:56.520 --> 1:10:00.360]  that's why our constitution says no standing army inside the country because in every case
[1:10:00.360 --> 1:10:06.920]  in history the military given enough time will take over special interests get control of them
[1:10:06.920 --> 1:10:11.640]  and they say hey we'll just use an excuse and take over that's the easiest way to get rich and
[1:10:11.640 --> 1:10:16.520]  powerful and they'll have use a bunch of high-tech propaganda and people believe it
[1:10:20.920 --> 1:10:28.200]  i mean it's so much deeper down the rat hole past left right and all these stupid terms and issues
[1:10:30.920 --> 1:10:35.320]  the whole media the whole culture is the dominant corporate media is
[1:10:35.320 --> 1:10:43.320]  is the false world pulled up over your eyes to blind you from the truth to paraphrase the matrix
[1:10:45.320 --> 1:10:51.080]  that's why when the ap calls or Reuters calls or the wall street journal calls they call all
[1:10:51.080 --> 1:10:57.240]  the time every week i go no i'm not doing the interview and and and and they go why and i go
[1:10:57.240 --> 1:11:03.400]  because if this isn't a hit piece then it won't be published and then they always call back Reuters

[1:16:39.480 --> 1:16:46.120]  who we interviewed here we went to tent cities sent crews all over california
[1:16:48.120 --> 1:16:55.880]  um i mean we've just it goes on and on reading back over this list there's a whole bunch
[1:16:55.880 --> 1:17:06.120]  of people i haven't mentioned here oh uh wane madson wane madson's interviewed in dc
[1:17:07.800 --> 1:17:15.000]  and the list just goes on and on the research the archives the amount of material let me tell
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:24.200]  you what the film is about it is a companion to the obama deception and it's about obama and his
[1:17:24.200 --> 1:17:30.200]  lies and the frauds and the deception but the overall agenda he's trying to implement
[1:17:31.080 --> 1:17:36.920]  of eugenics of a world government of a bank of the world of the cashless society of the
[1:17:36.920 --> 1:17:43.480]  federalization of the states how they're bankrupting the states by design the film starts with the
[1:17:43.480 --> 1:17:51.240]  economic takeover how obama is continuing that what his larger agenda is cap and trade the eugenics
[1:17:51.240 --> 1:17:55.880]  john p holdren j rockefeller it's all in there
[1:17:57.960 --> 1:18:02.520]  and the problem is how to boil this down to two hours i'm trying to keep it at 120 minutes
[1:18:03.160 --> 1:18:10.520]  and it is an unprecedented film unprecedented scope unprecedented research i believe that it
[1:18:10.520 --> 1:18:16.120]  is going to rival or dwarf the obama deception if you get it out to everybody but i'll tell you
[1:18:16.120 --> 1:18:24.040]  research and work wise it is much better obama deception's great people should get it out to
[1:18:24.040 --> 1:18:31.080]  everybody but i mean this film it's like being pregnant i can't wait to see this baby when you're
[1:18:31.080 --> 1:18:35.000]  looking at your wife's stomach and you want to see the arm or leg moving around you want to see
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:44.520]  that baby can't wait to have it bouncing on your knee and uh we're definitely in labor here ladies
[1:18:44.520 --> 1:18:54.200]  and gentlemen on a biggin this is going to be like a 12 pounder and i'd say my other kids you know
[1:18:54.200 --> 1:19:01.080]  the obama deception's like a 10 pounder my son was over 10 pounds that's rough on one of the first
[1:19:01.080 --> 1:19:11.080]  one's a 10 pounder uh but uh the point is is this is a labor of love it is dynamic it is informative
[1:19:11.080 --> 1:19:19.320]  it is in their own words and we've got stuff like al gore here's an example just one little thing
[1:19:19.320 --> 1:19:24.200]  al gore when he was pushing nafta and gatton lying and saying how great it would be and then we cut
[1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:29.400]  with him using the same terms when he's pushing the carbon tax i mean it's just got all sorts of
[1:19:29.400 --> 1:19:36.200]  research in it and and and old videos of holdren and new videos and stuff people haven't seen and

[1:33:17.560 --> 1:33:25.000]  after harassing the owner of the founder of whole foods since confirmed because the headquarters
[1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:30.760]  is right down the street from our office from multiple executives there that the owner is a
[1:33:30.760 --> 1:33:35.960]  huge fan of the show i'm just going to put the message out right now that he listens to the
[1:33:35.960 --> 1:33:41.880]  show every week that we want you on the show because he's come out and written an op-ed piece
[1:33:41.880 --> 1:33:46.040]  for the wall street journal saying people need to start eating healthier and not eating all these
[1:33:46.040 --> 1:33:50.920]  gmo and the monosodium glutamate and the aspartame that is the biggest problem and that we wouldn't
[1:33:50.920 --> 1:33:56.040]  wouldn't have all these health care costs it's true some estimates have it saving half the money
[1:33:56.040 --> 1:34:00.760]  if people would just stop living like absolute slobs myself included ladies and gentlemen
[1:34:01.880 --> 1:34:07.560]  last seven months i've lost 40 pounds now 40 it's 37 last week you know this
[1:34:09.160 --> 1:34:13.240]  and it's just simple like what eating any kind of junk i started running every morning sometimes
[1:34:13.240 --> 1:34:21.480]  every evening end of story but look they're now the left is now coming after him former
[1:34:21.480 --> 1:34:26.760]  darling on the left saying how dare you say that you evil person we're going to boycott you well
[1:34:26.760 --> 1:34:33.560]  i say whole foods is great that's where we shop everybody should go to whole foods the counter
[1:34:33.560 --> 1:34:47.800]  that type of crud that type of psychological terrorism that type of censorship uh look uh
[1:34:47.800 --> 1:34:52.440]  fall the republic has the solutions in it of how to save the republic it identifies
[1:34:52.440 --> 1:34:57.880]  who is destroying the republic who wants to pull down the republic to set up a world government
[1:34:57.880 --> 1:35:04.920]  on its ashes watson that's the key in the article you're writing is that the world government needs
[1:35:04.920 --> 1:35:11.960]  the united states to to fall and that's what our film exposes their agenda their program the lies
[1:35:12.840 --> 1:35:17.560]  the eugenics what they're going to do how they're going to stage it i just hope we get it out
[1:35:17.560 --> 1:35:24.120]  before obama stages of terror attack i will tell you that i'm going to have the film actually done
[1:35:24.120 --> 1:35:33.080]  in late september almost mid september right after we don't like the 17th 18th but then
[1:35:33.080 --> 1:35:38.040]  there's some mastering and some things involved and it gets manufactured that like the 20th
[1:35:38.920 --> 1:35:44.840]  here's the issue i'm going to have that sucker locked and loaded in case the establishment
[1:35:44.840 --> 1:35:54.840]  stages any crises the i mean if i see tremors if i see them engaging in pre attack preparation i mean
[1:35:54.840 --> 1:35:59.400]  they'll come right out telegraph they're about the stage the new king of chicago or something i mean
[1:35:59.400 --> 1:36:03.880]  that's that's kind of see that in the cards or some incredible new bio weapon release
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:09.480]  and so i may pull the trigger early on this but i cannot make the next film that people don't
[1:36:09.480 --> 1:36:14.040]  order the dvd so we always do the pre-order and that has the hype associated with this we get
[1:36:14.040 --> 1:36:20.840]  enough orders to pay for part of the film before it even comes out uh you know for the next one
[1:36:20.840 --> 1:36:26.040]  because this this film i don't even want to say the budget on this film with graphics and the music
[1:36:26.040 --> 1:36:33.320]  and the flying people to 20 different it's night eight 19 or 20 different places we flew them but
[1:36:34.120 --> 1:36:39.800]  sometimes per trip they're you know they would 1920 trips with multiple legs on each trip i mean
[1:36:39.800 --> 1:36:45.880]  we've been to canada a couple times and seattle and la and just just everywhere
[1:36:55.080 --> 1:37:01.320]  but i mean think about cnn with all the government funding and all the propaganda in 1991 and we're
[1:37:01.320 --> 1:37:09.560]  going to show you their stage fake newscast and look at how pathetic it was and then think about us
[1:37:09.560 --> 1:37:19.080]  just a ragtag group of of of less than 20 people and all that we've been able to do but it's because
[1:37:19.080 --> 1:37:25.720]  of you getting the word out you taking action so i'm going to ask you in this article what's
[1:37:25.720 --> 1:37:30.840]  it's doing to make this the most important film we've ever put out to make it the biggest film
[1:37:30.840 --> 1:37:38.280]  we've ever put out and i'll just give everybody a heads up the minute the film's down we already
[1:37:38.280 --> 1:37:47.640]  have raw versions of most of it done in different locations if you see some kind of terror attack
[1:37:47.640 --> 1:37:52.520]  happen or something go on you better know within a few hours it's going to be on the web because
[1:37:52.520 --> 1:37:57.720]  i'm not going to let them get the jump on us and the film gets into stage terror as well i'm in a
[1:37:57.720 --> 1:38:05.400]  race against time and see if i don't take the time i won't be powerful so see this is why i'm like
[1:38:05.400 --> 1:38:14.200]  gnawing gnawing at the at the at the at the gate for the gate to pop open so i can get out on the
[1:38:14.200 --> 1:38:20.280]  on the track here uh all right i said i'd take your calls i'm gonna shut up now
[1:38:21.560 --> 1:38:26.120]  fall the republic ladies and gentlemen i am fit to be tired right now just so you know
[1:38:26.120 --> 1:38:32.680]  lucas in texas you're on the air lucas hey how's it going elix has been a while good good to hear
[1:38:32.680 --> 1:38:37.160]  from you go ahead so uh hey some people have alluded to the idea that the elites have actually
[1:38:37.160 --> 1:38:41.960]  lost control of the economy i say no way it's going just as they planned if you refer to the
[1:38:41.960 --> 1:38:46.520]  article on your site unemployment edges up to the great depression level uh there's a map on there
[1:38:46.520 --> 1:38:50.920]  and i know it's a government statistic and very under inflated but it actually serves a purpose
[1:38:50.920 --> 1:38:56.600]  for what i need to demonstrate here uh all the states that run along that the trans texas corridor
[1:38:56.600 --> 1:39:00.840]  have the lowest unemployment rate in the country like texas oklahoma kansas nebraska south to
[1:39:00.840 --> 1:39:07.080]  coda north to coda montana wyoming colorado new mexico uh they're actually defunding the other
[1:39:07.080 --> 1:39:13.160]  states yeah that's the cancer that's the cancer line uh so the cancer has sucked the blood supply
[1:39:13.160 --> 1:39:18.440]  for itself up through the nafta development zone and and absolutely that's how it works
[1:39:19.400 --> 1:39:23.480]  do is they're going to defund the other states and then they're going to offer massive government
[1:39:23.480 --> 1:39:29.320]  programs building wind and solar farms along the trans texas corridor states using the terminology
[1:39:29.320 --> 1:39:34.520]  repowering america where they've already said that yeah and so the masses of unemployment are going
[1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:38.440]  to flock to those states uh there are already various news stories out there showing the people
[1:39:38.440 --> 1:39:42.360]  in families packing up and moving to these uh states for work now you have to move to the
[1:39:42.360 --> 1:39:47.640]  development corridors and it's a planned economy and it's actually in in game it's in my first film
[1:39:47.640 --> 1:39:53.720]  america destroyed by design the un maps of yes uh it's just going to be you're not going to be
[1:39:53.720 --> 1:39:58.520]  allowed in half the country it's going to be an environmental dictatorship there's going to be
[1:39:58.520 --> 1:40:04.360]  at least 10 million police uh most of them environmental inspecting your home weekly it is
[1:40:04.360 --> 1:40:10.360]  going to be hell if they can uh if if you have room in your new documentary if you could take
[1:40:10.360 --> 1:40:16.600]  that unemployment map and graphically overlay the uh the trans texas corridor to the good of a good
[1:40:16.600 --> 1:40:21.000]  excellent visual representation got an idea how about some graphics person do it and then mail it to
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:27.960]  us because i mean i'm literally i got i got three video editors uh we're in here 24 7 trying to
[1:40:27.960 --> 1:40:33.080]  sift through the problem is we ended up doing five six months of research and then we we have then
[1:40:33.080 --> 1:40:38.680]  it's like cramming it into the film uh but i'm not complaining i'm just saying yes it's a good idea
[1:40:39.400 --> 1:40:43.320]  we a little bit in the north american union i appreciate your call because it gets great points
[1:40:43.320 --> 1:40:49.560]  i mean i we do cover some of that in the film but i mean it's just how do you even get that across
[1:40:49.560 --> 1:40:53.880]  to people i mean how do you even communicate the master plan that's what i mean you've got to see
[1:40:53.880 --> 1:41:01.480]  it to believe it you've got to immerse yourself in this for years before it starts even i liken it to
[1:41:01.480 --> 1:41:08.200]  night vision have you ever gone out in the really dark woods at night remember when i was a little
[1:41:08.200 --> 1:41:13.400]  kid my dad would take me for walks we were out on the ranch you know down the path into the woods
[1:41:13.400 --> 1:41:18.360]  and and and teach me to hear sounds and how your ears all the sudden like turn up they even you know
[1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:24.920]  suddenly can almost hear better because your brain your your brain focuses in better in your eyes
[1:41:24.920 --> 1:41:30.120]  within about 20 30 minutes it just gets better and better and better and better the night vision
[1:41:30.120 --> 1:41:36.360]  and pretty soon it's like black and white you can see that good you just don't see in color
[1:41:39.640 --> 1:41:45.560]  it's amazing and it's the same thing with seeing the new world order i mean it's you've
[1:41:45.560 --> 1:41:51.480]  got a really focus on it it's like a hidden picture you know they have on the wall and as
[1:41:51.480 --> 1:41:56.120]  soon as you see the hidden picture it's like how did i not see that before it's right there but you
[1:41:56.120 --> 1:42:01.560]  couldn't see it before and that's what's so frustrating is this is this is out in the open
[1:42:02.360 --> 1:42:08.760]  and 99.99 percent of us are in the same boat together this is not good for anybody but 6000
[1:42:08.760 --> 1:42:14.520]  superclass elite in the words of the washington post themselves and roth cop billy in vegas you're
[1:42:14.520 --> 1:42:20.440]  on the air hello alex i wanted to say a comment on what you said about the local papers because
[1:42:20.440 --> 1:42:26.920]  you're 100 right as usual um my fellow info warrior and i've been went to a uh a town hall
[1:42:26.920 --> 1:42:32.120]  meeting and the uh the las vegas son which is totally in the grip of you know the new world
[1:42:32.120 --> 1:42:37.240]  order of course the first sentence this guy brendan buehler writes is denied the opportunity
[1:42:37.240 --> 1:42:43.080]  to embarrass themselves at any official health care town hall about 900 angry nevadans gathered
[1:42:43.080 --> 1:42:48.360]  at stony's rocking country bar that's his first sentence you know like it's good they were denied
[1:42:48.360 --> 1:42:54.760]  their ride and uh you know and they're embarrassed see the height doesn't work all the slick glitz
[1:42:54.760 --> 1:43:01.160]  and info babes licking their lips with sexual desire people know it's fundamentals baloney now
[1:43:01.160 --> 1:43:08.600]  so it doesn't work and and uh you better believe in los vegas major papers are are gonna be spook
[1:43:08.600 --> 1:43:13.160]  run because they can't have when there's murders or corruption or things go on they got to make sure
[1:43:13.160 --> 1:43:17.960]  their people are in place to make sure nothing embarrassing gets out of course that's where
[1:43:17.960 --> 1:43:21.960]  the you know i mean that's where the banks sucker and rip everybody off so they gotta
[1:43:22.520 --> 1:43:28.840]  that's a big watering hole uh fleecing the moron public but then he goes on to say one
[1:43:28.840 --> 1:43:33.800]  proponent of health insurance reform was allowed on stage to speak it was 900 people it was eight
[1:43:33.800 --> 1:43:38.760]  in favor health care one wanted to get up to speak and she said anyone else in favor of health care
[1:43:38.760 --> 1:43:42.040]  to come up but this guy makes it sound like you know the whole place was full of them
[1:43:42.040 --> 1:43:46.840]  and only one was allowed on stage then he talks about me in the paper i i wear special shoes that
[1:43:46.840 --> 1:43:51.000]  have springs on them the good for your back to call the coils so he describes me one man with
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:55.640]  large springs attached to the heels of his shoes and a bumper sticker affixed to his bandana the
[1:43:55.640 --> 1:44:00.520]  red 9-11 was an inside job announced to build a burg group to trilateral commission and international
[1:44:00.520 --> 1:44:06.200]  bankers to huge applause so in other words i'm got a huge applause i hope they get it it's over
[1:44:06.200 --> 1:44:13.960]  for you scum that's right that's right oh god i just it makes me so sick they can't kill the
[1:44:13.960 --> 1:44:20.040]  signal they can't kill the signal billy no matter they can kill us individually but this idea is
[1:44:20.040 --> 1:44:27.880]  absolutely bulletproof it is like a du sable round fired from an abram's gun turret nothing's
[1:44:27.880 --> 1:44:33.480]  stopping it go ahead tell us brendan buller guy that i i challenge him to a debate him or his
[1:44:33.480 --> 1:44:39.240]  editors anyone anytime anywhere on any media any forum anywhere debate because they'll laugh at me
[1:44:39.240 --> 1:44:44.040]  and people like us you know but they don't they don't have you notice thunderous applause he's
[1:44:44.040 --> 1:44:49.160]  telling you you're an idiot he's telling you you're a clown he's telling you your your shoes
[1:44:49.160 --> 1:44:55.240]  that are sold in all the major stores all over tv are are bad he's telling you that you're a cook
[1:44:55.240 --> 1:45:01.320]  but the but everybody's on your side no you're the cook dumbass for not knowing to be with the people
[1:45:02.280 --> 1:45:07.320]  because that fool thinks he's part of the elite he doesn't understand that he is just with us the
[1:45:07.320 --> 1:45:15.240]  commoners i appreciate your call billy brian and canada you're on the air hi alex hi my message
[1:45:15.240 --> 1:45:19.400]  is just to the canadians that would be listening on your show because one of the things that i'm
[1:45:19.400 --> 1:45:24.200]  fed up of it's been like four years now when i talk to people actually longer than that for this little
[1:45:24.200 --> 1:45:29.880]  mental derangement that they have when you talk to them about what's going on they'll always go
[1:45:29.880 --> 1:45:35.320]  well is that in the states and if you say yeah oh we don't live in the states we live in canada
[1:45:35.320 --> 1:45:41.240]  yeah no no canadians i found are very nice people but they're hyper delusional on average
[1:45:41.240 --> 1:45:47.720]  hyper smiley face have no idea the incredible turning canada in many respects is worse than
[1:45:47.720 --> 1:45:53.800]  the united states on this whole program canada's a few steps ahead of the united states they just
[1:45:53.800 --> 1:46:00.360]  have this fake liberal facade they put up making everybody feel like they're part of the system
[1:46:01.320 --> 1:46:06.600]  exactly and i'd like everybody to know that i've got the north american avian and pandemic
[1:46:06.600 --> 1:46:12.520]  influenza plan and what that basically tells me is that since the who went to level six about two
[1:46:12.520 --> 1:46:17.640]  months ago those are the rules that were under so all they would have to do is look up no it's
[1:46:17.640 --> 1:46:23.720]  admitted there is no us there is no canada we're already under imf world bank control we're already
[1:46:23.720 --> 1:46:32.760]  under un wto control world health organization control it's official exactly and it's a stinking
[1:46:32.760 --> 1:46:40.600]  fraud that when barack obama makes his decisions i actually have to pay more attention to that
[1:46:40.600 --> 1:46:45.960]  than to anything the president fox in mexico does or my little puppet steven harper does
[1:46:45.960 --> 1:46:51.880]  because none of those really count exactly the the the the the global walking orders
[1:46:51.880 --> 1:46:59.240]  marching orders come out of obama's trap and uh then it's all regurgitated and parroted
[1:46:59.800 --> 1:47:05.560]  but with a local spin and look you want to know what's going on read the un documents read they
[1:47:05.560 --> 1:47:11.880]  brag how they're running and it's all a big sick joke indeed and it and just like you said all
[1:47:11.880 --> 1:47:16.920]  the for a canadian to test it it's quite simple let's say they release a statement saying that
[1:47:16.920 --> 1:47:22.440]  tamaflu is safe for babies now well then just do a quick google search and you'll see that it's the
[1:47:22.440 --> 1:47:29.160]  same title on every newspaper across the country there's a lack of imagination nobody has and
[1:47:29.160 --> 1:47:33.960]  knows how because it's all being regurgitated the reporters just repeat it downhill i appreciate
[1:47:33.960 --> 1:47:38.760]  your call yeah most your reporters aren't cia they're not department of defense they're not mi6
[1:47:39.560 --> 1:47:45.080]  but they just regurgitate what the mi6 writes look i told you when they blew up building seven
[1:47:45.080 --> 1:47:51.240]  on 9 11 the 47 story building with a cia command bunker in it environment and police are on video
[1:47:51.240 --> 1:48:01.160]  and on cbs going get back the government's decided to blow it up on video then it came out that bbc
[1:48:01.880 --> 1:48:08.520]  had reported 25 minutes before it fell simultaneously to the minute on two different channels the exact
[1:48:08.520 --> 1:48:13.960]  same words that building seven had fallen in its own footprint from fires and structural damage
[1:48:13.960 --> 1:48:22.200]  the script it was the exact words at the exact time on bbc world and bbc 24 one plus one equals two
[1:48:22.760 --> 1:48:29.480]  i said that was a script fed to them by the government and then they lied and said we
[1:48:29.480 --> 1:48:33.880]  didn't do that that wasn't our video okay it was but we lost the tapes and then years later they
[1:48:33.880 --> 1:48:43.480]  said oh it was just a coincidence no big deal yes it's true roiders gave us an internal feed
[1:48:43.480 --> 1:48:48.680]  telling us that of course of course just like hours before they'd caught

[1:54:57.520 --> 1:55:04.240]  And in doing so, they committed crimes against themselves.
[1:55:04.240 --> 1:55:09.120]  It was against their true design.
[1:55:09.120 --> 1:55:13.520]  But some would argue that they were destined from the foundation of the earth to play the

[1:58:49.640 --> 1:58:54.200]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[1:58:54.200 --> 1:58:58.560]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[1:58:58.560 --> 1:58:59.560]  do you want?
[1:58:59.560 --> 1:59:01.560]  My answer would be all I can get.
[1:59:01.560 --> 1:59:06.560]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[1:59:06.560 --> 1:59:07.800]  How much do you want?
[1:59:07.800 --> 1:59:08.800]  When do you want it?
[1:59:08.800 --> 1:59:10.840]  Now or after the battle starts?
[1:59:10.840 --> 1:59:11.960]  When will you need it?
[1:59:11.960 --> 1:59:15.400]  When you buy it without proper identification, will there be any food?
[1:59:15.400 --> 1:59:16.880]  Will it make your children sick?
[1:59:16.880 --> 1:59:21.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:22.160]  and be immunized?
[1:59:22.160 --> 1:59:25.960]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:59:25.960 --> 1:59:29.560]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[1:59:29.560 --> 1:59:30.800]  How much will you need?
[1:59:30.800 --> 1:59:31.800]  We don't know.
[1:59:31.800 --> 1:59:32.800]  How much do you want?
[1:59:32.800 --> 1:59:33.800]  All you can get.
[1:59:33.800 --> 1:59:34.800]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:59:34.800 --> 1:59:42.480]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day, call 1-800-409-5633 or check it

[2:00:11.360 --> 2:00:13.520]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:13.520 --> 2:00:21.960]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:21.960 --> 2:00:29.040]  Well, for the next hour, by the way, we're live at PrisonPlanet.tv, someone casting last
[2:00:29.040 --> 2:00:35.200]  two hours, four-hour show today, we are joined by John Perkins, best-selling, New York Times
[2:00:35.200 --> 2:00:38.840]  number one best-selling, Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[2:00:38.840 --> 2:00:45.920]  He's got his part two vaunted hoodwinked about to come out in the next few months, already
[2:00:45.920 --> 2:00:51.560]  on pre-sell, I'm told, guaranteed to be another best-seller, probably number one again.
[2:00:51.560 --> 2:00:55.240]  And by the way, he is in my upcoming film, Fall of the Republic.
[2:00:55.240 --> 2:00:59.600]  So we're going to be, and that's a film all about the economy and what these big corporate
[2:00:59.600 --> 2:01:00.920]  interests are doing.
[2:01:00.920 --> 2:01:04.760]  It's bipartisan looking at how both parties are controlled by the same interest.
[2:01:04.760 --> 2:01:06.960]  So we're honored to have him with us for the next hour.
[2:01:06.960 --> 2:01:07.960]  Coming up in 30 minutes.
[2:01:07.960 --> 2:01:12.320]  We're going to open the phone specifically on Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[2:01:12.320 --> 2:01:18.240]  Most people know who John is, but it's always best maybe to have him just briefly recap
[2:01:18.240 --> 2:01:22.240]  what he did and then why he woke up and changed direction.
[2:01:22.240 --> 2:01:24.080]  Mr. Perkins, great to have you here with us.
[2:01:24.080 --> 2:01:25.080]  Great to be with you, Alex.
[2:01:25.080 --> 2:01:26.080]  Thanks for having me on.
[2:01:26.080 --> 2:01:28.080]  On Instagram, I really enjoyed talking with your film crew.
[2:01:28.080 --> 2:01:30.080]  You've got a great group of people.
[2:01:30.080 --> 2:01:31.080]  They are good guys.
[2:01:31.080 --> 2:01:34.840]  Yeah, I think I said Aaron Dykes and Rob Dew out to see you out in Florida.
[2:01:34.840 --> 2:01:35.840]  Yeah, they were there.
[2:01:35.840 --> 2:01:36.840]  Fantastic.
[2:01:36.840 --> 2:01:37.840]  They're really good interviewers.
[2:01:37.840 --> 2:01:39.840]  I think you're going to have a heck of a film.
[2:01:39.840 --> 2:01:42.680]  Oh, it looks great, too.
[2:01:42.680 --> 2:01:45.560]  Great shot out your back window of the bay there.
[2:01:45.560 --> 2:01:46.560]  Just wonderful.
[2:01:46.560 --> 2:01:48.520]  But plus, you're a great interview to do.
[2:01:48.520 --> 2:01:51.720]  You're even better in person than over the radio, which is hard to believe.
[2:01:51.720 --> 2:01:53.840]  You're a smooth operator, John Perkins.
[2:01:53.840 --> 2:01:55.560]  It's almost like you're an economic hitman.
[2:01:55.560 --> 2:01:58.760]  We're really good at patting each other's backs, aren't we, Alex?
[2:01:58.760 --> 2:02:01.000]  No, but it did go well.
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  It did go well.
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:03.000]  Yeah.
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:05.680]  And that is exciting.
[2:02:05.680 --> 2:02:08.040]  Michelle, tell folks about yourself and get into hoodwinked.
[2:02:08.040 --> 2:02:13.000]  Well, I was an economic hitman, and you know, I think it's fair to say that we economic
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:16.720]  hitmen have created the world's first truly global empire.
[2:02:16.720 --> 2:02:20.720]  We've done it primarily without the military, first time in history, that's happened.
[2:02:20.720 --> 2:02:24.800]  And we worked many ways, but the most common is that we identify a third world country
[2:02:24.800 --> 2:02:28.480]  that has resources, our corporations covet.
[2:02:28.480 --> 2:02:34.320]  Then we basically convince, bribe, coerce the leaders of those countries that they're
[2:02:34.320 --> 2:02:38.960]  accepting loans to build big infrastructure projects, but the money doesn't go to those
[2:02:38.960 --> 2:02:39.960]  countries.
[2:02:39.960 --> 2:02:44.560]  Instead, it goes to our own companies that build those projects like hydro dams and highways
[2:02:44.560 --> 2:02:49.520]  and airports, things that help with two very rich people in those countries, but don't
[2:02:49.520 --> 2:02:53.000]  help the majority of the people who don't have enough money to buy electricity or drive
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:57.200]  cars on the highways or work in the industrial park or benefit from them.
[2:02:57.200 --> 2:03:00.560]  But the country's not holding a huge debt that it can't repay.
[2:03:00.560 --> 2:03:04.760]  So at some point we go back and say, you know, you owe us all this money, you can't repay
[2:03:04.760 --> 2:03:09.000]  it, but give us a pound of flesh, tell your oil real cheap to our oil companies, or vote
[2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  with us on the next critical United Nations vote, send troops in support of ours to someplace
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:15.680]  like Iraq.
[2:03:15.680 --> 2:03:20.240]  And when we fail, I talk in my books about how I fail with Jaime Roldos, President of
[2:03:20.240 --> 2:03:26.440]  Ecuador and Omar Tarihosa Panama, when we fail the jackals go in, and these are CIA-sponsored
[2:03:26.440 --> 2:03:31.080]  people who overthrow governments or assassinate their leaders, both Roldos and Tarihosa were
[2:03:31.080 --> 2:03:34.440]  assassinated because I failed.
[2:03:34.440 --> 2:03:39.280]  And in this way we've really created the world's first truly global empire.
[2:03:39.280 --> 2:03:43.560]  Now what's interesting, and what I talk a lot about at Goodwink is that we were so successful
[2:03:43.560 --> 2:03:48.560]  at doing this in the third world that now it's come back, and the economic hitmen have
[2:03:48.560 --> 2:03:53.560]  come home to roost, are these same techniques of being implemented here in the United States
[2:03:53.560 --> 2:03:55.280]  as well as throughout the rest of the world.
[2:03:55.280 --> 2:03:59.240]  And it's one of the reasons that we're having this tremendous recession that we're undergoing
[2:03:59.240 --> 2:04:04.920]  today, this huge economic tsunami that hit us, it's really a consequence of these policies
[2:04:04.920 --> 2:04:10.040]  that we've been implementing for the last several decades.
[2:04:10.040 --> 2:04:14.560]  We're going to go to break when we come back, long segment coming up, let's get into Goodwink,
[2:04:14.560 --> 2:04:19.080]  which is in many ways a different book than Confessions of Economic Hitman.
[2:04:19.080 --> 2:04:28.040]  I was in an airport in LA and saw this bookstore full of people with two people grabbing and
[2:04:28.040 --> 2:04:29.040]  buying the books up.
[2:04:29.040 --> 2:04:34.560]  I was watching the stack of Economic Hitman go down just in 20 seconds while I was looking
[2:04:34.560 --> 2:04:39.520]  at a magazine, so really exciting that your book has had such success because when I could
[2:04:39.520 --> 2:04:46.240]  physically see people buying it off the shelf in front of me in seconds, it just must be
[2:04:46.240 --> 2:04:47.240]  amazing.
[2:04:47.240 --> 2:04:51.840]  When we come back, we'll talk about Goodwink probably going to be even bigger with John
[2:04:51.840 --> 2:04:58.320]  Perkins and his take on the Blackwater revelations, how that ties into CIA hit teams, the Jackals
[2:04:58.320 --> 2:05:00.520]  and a lot more.
[2:05:00.520 --> 2:05:05.160]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[2:05:05.160 --> 2:05:06.160]  you to eat.
[2:05:06.160 --> 2:05:09.680]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you
[2:05:09.680 --> 2:05:10.680]  sick?
[2:05:10.680 --> 2:05:12.640]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[2:05:12.640 --> 2:05:15.560]  You don't have to cooperate, there is a solution.
[2:05:15.560 --> 2:05:19.200]  Cleaner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing
[2:05:19.200 --> 2:05:24.040]  products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[2:05:24.040 --> 2:05:29.160]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the
[2:05:29.160 --> 2:05:31.400]  energy you need and will keep you well.
[2:05:31.400 --> 2:05:36.800]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health
[2:05:36.800 --> 2:05:37.800]  ranger.
[2:05:37.800 --> 2:05:42.360]  I love their Nutric Cafe, great organic coffee, infused with herbal extracts to boost your
[2:05:42.360 --> 2:05:43.560]  immune system.
[2:05:43.560 --> 2:05:47.600]  Buy all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[2:06:00.560 --> 2:06:04.480]  Hello friends this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[2:06:04.480 --> 2:06:06.760]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[2:06:06.760 --> 2:06:12.360]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals
[2:06:12.360 --> 2:06:15.400]  and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[2:06:15.400 --> 2:06:19.520]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental
[2:06:19.520 --> 2:06:20.840]  system diseases.
[2:06:20.840 --> 2:06:22.680]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[2:06:22.680 --> 2:06:27.440]  The Acola Blue atmospheric water generator is a low-cost way to take back control of
[2:06:27.440 --> 2:06:29.200]  you and your family's drinking water.
[2:06:29.200 --> 2:06:33.920]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[2:06:33.920 --> 2:06:39.320]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis and ultra-violent light sterilization
[2:06:39.320 --> 2:06:40.320]  techniques.
[2:06:40.320 --> 2:06:41.320]  That's right.
[2:06:41.320 --> 2:06:43.680]  You can take back control of your drinking water right from the air you breathe.

[2:07:00.400 --> 2:07:01.780]  This is Alex Jones.
[2:07:01.780 --> 2:07:03.800]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[2:07:03.800 --> 2:07:04.800]  Well you should.
[2:07:04.800 --> 2:07:09.320]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[2:07:09.320 --> 2:07:10.320]  That's right.
[2:07:10.320 --> 2:07:15.080]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training
[2:07:15.080 --> 2:07:18.640]  Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[2:07:18.640 --> 2:07:22.640]  All for pennies on the dollar, plus if you act fast, the millionaire patriot will give
[2:07:22.640 --> 2:07:27.240]  you a free, spring-filled armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[2:07:27.240 --> 2:07:31.360]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels
[2:07:31.360 --> 2:07:34.400]  that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[2:07:34.400 --> 2:07:38.800]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor
[2:07:38.800 --> 2:07:39.900]  attitudes.
