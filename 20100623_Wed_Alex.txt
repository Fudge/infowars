[00:20.760 --> 00:28.000]  we've got ominous new developments with Israel saying that they are strongly
[00:28.000 --> 00:32.640]  looking at new king Iran and it looks like the sanctions will go through at
[00:32.640 --> 00:38.400]  the UN to start boarding all the Iranian ships in active war I have mainstream
[00:38.400 --> 00:41.840]  news articles were all over the world governments are putting software in
[00:41.840 --> 00:46.240]  black boxes in people's homes including the US federal government's moving for
[00:46.240 --> 00:51.120]  that to track everything you do on the internet and also censor what you can
[00:51.120 --> 00:56.880]  see housing sales are down by an all-time record breaking all the previous
[00:56.880 --> 01:04.000]  records the last two years of 33 plus percent we have just incredible tyrannical
[01:04.000 --> 01:09.480]  news people are being arrested all over the country for sending mildly critical
[01:09.480 --> 01:15.120]  emails to the US Senate and House that's right if you send an email saying
[01:15.120 --> 01:20.000]  you're crazy don't cut my unemployment benefits I'll starve arrested
[01:20.000 --> 01:26.760]  mainstream news feds with straight faces with the full email saying that if
[01:26.760 --> 01:33.280]  something is quote annoying you will go to jail if it annoys a politician oh you
[01:33.280 --> 01:37.000]  didn't know they passed a law in 96 that if you annoy a politician you go to
[01:37.000 --> 01:44.360]  prison kind of like Lieberman a few days ago was on CNN saying well don't worry
[01:44.360 --> 01:49.040]  we do need the power like China to shut off the web but we won't use it very
[01:49.040 --> 01:55.000]  often I'm gonna play that clip today it's all happening this is bonafide hot
[01:55.000 --> 02:04.120]  naked very abusive ultra dangerous real tyranny it's brazen it's out in the open
[02:04.120 --> 02:08.400]  it is naked as a J bird as they say but don't worry about any of that news and
[02:08.400 --> 02:16.840]  information minutes before I went live in the closing minute of the game the
[02:16.840 --> 02:25.000]  United States in South Africa with Bill Clinton looking on beat Algeria one to
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.880]  zero and they weren't gonna win if they tied again they were gonna be out of it
[02:28.880 --> 02:33.880]  in England bloodied but but still made it in in beat the team they were playing
[02:33.880 --> 02:38.880]  so everything is fine ladies and gentlemen everything is fine it doesn't
[02:38.880 --> 02:42.240]  matter if there's deadly sodium fluoride in your water doesn't matter if there's
[02:42.240 --> 02:45.880]  cancer viruses in every major vaccine that's looked at doesn't matter if the
[02:45.880 --> 02:49.160]  times of India admits conclusive government studies that fluoridation of
[02:49.160 --> 02:54.600]  water has caused massive deformities in their population and death and and
[02:54.600 --> 02:58.560]  retardation that's mainstream news today but they get IMF World Bank money to do
[02:58.560 --> 03:02.600]  it because the IMF World Bank cares a lot about your teeth let me tell you
[03:02.600 --> 03:07.600]  um none of that matters World War three doesn't matter the banks taking
[03:07.600 --> 03:13.280]  everything over doesn't matter we had the game on here in the office and the
[03:13.280 --> 03:16.120]  guys were looking down some of them you know they're good guys they know what's
[03:16.120 --> 03:22.040]  going on they're hard-working but still they're smiling right now folks cuz we
[03:22.040 --> 03:27.480]  got England fans and US fans here in the office and they they won and were
[03:27.480 --> 03:32.200]  saved and then I watched as the US won there were people addressed in clown
[03:32.200 --> 03:38.200]  suits in red white and blue clown outfits jumping up and down and the in
[03:38.200 --> 03:42.040]  the ESPN zoomed in on that and said look at these good Americans and they cut to
[03:42.040 --> 03:46.560]  Bill Clinton being congratulated Bill Clinton I'll guarantee you could care
[03:46.560 --> 03:49.720]  less about soccer but you know it's a good PR move to be there and be seen as
[03:49.720 --> 03:53.720]  a fan of soccer is like a NASCAR you know oh look I like NASCAR look I like
[03:53.720 --> 03:58.360]  soccer I like football but he likes his cocaine and hookers and ripping people
[03:58.360 --> 04:02.040]  off as a con man and raping women remember all that and the court hearings
[04:02.040 --> 04:05.680]  biting them on the face while he slaps them and chokes them but it's okay he's
[04:05.680 --> 04:10.760]  a nice guy he likes the World Cup and so I thought we could have the new
[04:10.760 --> 04:14.920]  American flag be an ostrich with its head in the sand or maybe a man in a
[04:14.920 --> 04:21.160]  fetal position licking a thug with black boots on or maybe even better a bozo the
[04:21.160 --> 04:25.320]  clown a red white and blue bozo the clown because it cut to four guys in
[04:25.320 --> 04:28.680]  bozo the clown outfits in red white and blue with giant red white and blue
[04:28.680 --> 04:34.400]  afro clown wigs on just jumping up and down with their tribal warlike energy
[04:34.400 --> 04:41.800]  distracted off into the World Cup itself a global government brainwashing
[04:41.800 --> 04:45.680]  scenario and again ladies and gentlemen I'm not seeing soccer is bad I'm not
[04:45.680 --> 04:48.760]  seeing football but I'm not saying liking sports is bad especially if you
[04:48.760 --> 04:53.520]  compete in it my issue is we're going to hell in a handbasket the world is
[04:53.520 --> 04:57.800]  collapsing into turning right now and we better get as fired up about liberty and
[04:57.800 --> 05:02.000]  defending in a soccer this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[05:02.000 --> 05:06.440]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[05:06.440 --> 05:10.440]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[05:10.440 --> 05:14.360]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[05:14.360 --> 05:18.400]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[05:18.400 --> 05:22.960]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[05:22.960 --> 05:26.960]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[05:26.960 --> 05:30.800]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[05:30.800 --> 05:34.400]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[05:34.400 --> 05:38.720]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[05:38.720 --> 05:41.920]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[09:54.640 --> 10:00.240]  the latest Gulf developments I always let people call in and plug stuff and
[10:00.240 --> 10:04.360]  it's gotten out of control because what happens is people just flood the lines
[10:04.360 --> 10:08.400]  you want to plug something and so it doesn't turn into any type of
[10:08.400 --> 10:12.440]  information or debate it's just people plugging things so today we're gonna have

[10:39.520 --> 10:44.520]  will get you up and on the air now let me just let me just read to you the
[10:44.520 --> 10:50.680]  stacks of news I have here I'm seeing more and more cases of individuals who
[10:50.680 --> 10:56.480]  send not even threatening emails to Congress who are being arrested on the
[10:56.480 --> 11:03.560]  Huffington Post the AP the Salt Lake City papers have reported on it here's a
[11:03.560 --> 11:09.560]  story I've got it says Nat Hentaw Philadelphia man indicted for using
[11:09.560 --> 11:14.760]  right-to-free speech and we've covered this before but now I'm seeing new cases
[11:14.760 --> 11:20.800]  of this his message to Senator Bunning staffers he was watching the floor
[11:20.800 --> 11:24.400]  hearings about getting rid of unemployment benefits and he said are you
[11:24.400 --> 11:31.880]  insane no checks equal no food for me do you get it and the FBI came and has
[11:31.880 --> 11:41.320]  arrested him and he's charged and under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 section
[11:41.320 --> 11:47.480]  1934 and that's the one that put my federal law cell phones track you in
[11:47.480 --> 11:52.640]  real-time and can physically listen to you with the NSA dial-in that's what took
[11:52.640 --> 11:56.000]  over the radio and TV stations and put these government control boxes in the
[11:56.000 --> 11:59.920]  last piece of equipment in the chain before broadcast or transmission well
[11:59.920 --> 12:07.040]  also in the act in section 1934 it says did utilize a telecommunication device
[12:07.040 --> 12:11.560]  that is a computer whether or not communication ensued without disclosing
[12:11.560 --> 12:16.280]  his identity and with the intent to annoy abuse threaten and harass any
[12:16.280 --> 12:20.720]  person who received the communication and of course the guy sent it from his
[12:20.720 --> 12:25.560]  email but they still say well because you didn't identify yourself and because
[12:25.560 --> 12:32.600]  you annoyed by calling him insane you are facing felony charges right now see
[12:32.600 --> 12:38.360]  see when I read something like that I think about the clip from two days ago
[12:38.360 --> 12:44.920]  of Lieberman who's also got legislation in the Senate with John McCain that
[12:44.920 --> 12:49.040]  allows the secret arrest of citizens for any reason including intelligence
[12:49.040 --> 12:53.320]  gathering by the president attorney general joint chiefs of staff or any
[12:53.320 --> 12:58.400]  of their designates anyone in the government who wants to put a bag over
[12:58.400 --> 13:03.840]  your head and put you in a van and you disappear forever only an act of
[13:03.840 --> 13:07.280]  Congress this is in the legislation you've heard in the Palatano by the
[13:07.280 --> 13:11.200]  ways on tomorrow judge Andrew Napolitano talk about that it's not just me
[13:11.200 --> 13:14.440]  saying it if you want to read the bill at least take Napolitano's word for it
[13:14.440 --> 13:18.760]  I mean I know it sounds crazy that you disappear into an absolute black hole
[13:18.760 --> 13:24.480]  and only an act of Congress can find out where you are that is beyond the Nazis
[13:24.480 --> 13:30.960]  beyond the Soviets beyond now oh the Nazis and the Soviets and the Chinese
[13:30.960 --> 13:34.760]  Communists and the Pol Pot nuts and all of them they would have on paper all
[13:34.760 --> 13:38.640]  these wonderful rice you had they would just under the table do whatever they
[13:38.640 --> 13:43.560]  wanted and make you find assigned fake confessions and things now no not in
[13:43.560 --> 13:48.520]  America no they have White House memos ordering torture bush brags about
[13:48.520 --> 13:52.440]  ordering torture no one gets in trouble for it even though it's illegal in the
[13:52.440 --> 13:57.040]  administration Obama continues it expands it and all these people it's
[13:57.040 --> 14:01.320]  last time I checked it's over 38 people in prison for torture in Afghanistan
[14:01.320 --> 14:05.560]  and Iraq who followed directives from the Pentagon directly from the White
[14:05.560 --> 14:10.440]  House on record you rotten prison bush runs around on TV talking about how he
[14:10.440 --> 14:16.880]  ordered the torture now that is bonafide tyranny the real McCoy it
[14:16.880 --> 14:23.240]  doesn't get any more slithering and evil than that oh man I tell you things are
[14:23.240 --> 14:28.680]  just upside down and so we're entering the vortex now and the new Cyber
[14:28.680 --> 14:32.760]  Security Act separately they don't care if it doesn't pass kind of like Obama
[14:32.760 --> 14:40.920]  says he's going to use the EPA to implement the carbon taxes through the
[14:40.920 --> 14:47.440]  power plants and the gas pumps and the oil wells and of course BP is all part
[14:47.440 --> 14:51.600]  of this playing the part of the bad guy in this sex period theater right now the
[14:51.600 --> 14:55.680]  villain kind of like Jesse Ventura played the villain in World Federation
[14:55.680 --> 15:05.560]  wrestling and Obama just says you will give me 20 billion and of course BP says
[15:05.560 --> 15:13.480]  yes sir against setting that precedent that he's the dictator and it's the
[15:13.480 --> 15:18.320]  office that is the dictatorship puppets come and go they'll discard him no
[15:18.320 --> 15:22.400]  doubt the next two and a half years I saw this coming when I made the Obama
[15:22.400 --> 15:26.760]  deception out two months into his administration being produced the day he
[15:26.760 --> 15:32.440]  was elected we went into full production mode in November of 2008 and I said he
[15:32.440 --> 15:37.600]  would be discarded that he would be a one-term president I could see it in the
[15:37.600 --> 15:42.800]  cards I could see it in the tea leaves as plain as the nose on my face or the
[15:42.800 --> 15:50.000]  sun rising in the morning setting in the evening 100% as they built up the
[15:50.000 --> 15:55.600]  messianic leader only to make him the scapegoat puppet and you now see all
[15:55.600 --> 15:59.360]  these people getting ready to leave his administration rats scurrying away from
[15:59.360 --> 16:04.480]  the sinking ship Emmanuel and others and then there'll be a big victory by the
[16:04.480 --> 16:08.960]  Republicans as they pour in and stage a new terror attack and launch some more
[16:08.960 --> 16:15.240]  wars and suddenly Chris Matthews and Keith Oberman will suddenly report on
[16:15.240 --> 16:18.320]  government stage terror and the New World Order now it's all a Republican
[16:18.320 --> 16:22.160]  creature and then suddenly the Republicans on Fox News will play the
[16:22.160 --> 16:26.120]  part of the establishment saying there's no New World Order oh right now they
[16:26.120 --> 16:35.080]  talk about it endlessly so see that's just one article there that I do want
[16:35.080 --> 16:40.480]  to get more into but look at this black South Carolina Republican poised to go
[16:40.480 --> 16:45.240]  to Congress voters in South Carolina nominated a black Republican lawmaker
[16:45.240 --> 16:48.920]  oh I thought they're all racist tea party he said he's the tea party person
[16:48.920 --> 16:54.920]  oh voters in South Carolina nominated a black Republican lawmaker for an open
[16:54.920 --> 17:01.880]  congressional seat Tuesday rejecting a legendary political name and adding
[17:01.880 --> 17:07.760]  diversity to the national party state rep Tim Scott defeated Paul Thurmond oh
[17:07.760 --> 17:15.160]  the son of Strom Thurmond by the time he left Congress couldn't even talk an
[17:15.160 --> 17:20.560]  attorney who is the son of the one-time segregationist US senator Strom
[17:20.560 --> 17:25.720]  Thurmond Scott who won the runoff with 69% of the vote see that's the majority
[17:25.720 --> 17:34.080]  of those voters who happen to be lily white voting for the black man boy what's
[17:34.080 --> 17:38.880]  Chris Matthews gonna do with that one oh I wouldn't mind having a completely
[17:38.880 --> 17:42.720]  black Congress if they'd get rid of the income tax and leave my second
[17:42.720 --> 17:45.800]  amendment alone I wouldn't mind what color they could you could have the
[17:45.800 --> 17:49.200]  green skinned people in the Congress but that's not gonna happen is that there
[17:49.200 --> 17:53.800]  aren't any green-skinned people I guess unless you've been in a prison state
[17:53.800 --> 17:59.160]  representative Tim Scott defeated Paul Thurmond son of legendary senator
[17:59.160 --> 18:03.920]  Strom Thurmond Scott 44 owns an insurance business and became the first
[18:03.920 --> 18:07.320]  black Republican in the South Carolina legislature in more than a century when
[18:07.320 --> 18:11.400]  elected two years ago before that he served 13 years on Charleston County
[18:11.400 --> 18:15.600]  Council and you know why you didn't have a black Republican get elected there
[18:15.600 --> 18:19.160]  because they never ran blacks just think they're not welcome at tea parties are
[18:19.160 --> 18:21.240]  they think because the media tells them or they think they're not welcome to
[18:21.240 --> 18:25.440]  run as a Republican or statistics show they get elected even more often when
[18:25.440 --> 18:31.120]  they actually run the Democrats and this guy is the Tea Party candidate so
[18:31.120 --> 18:35.520]  what's the message here whether it's Kentucky or Pennsylvania or Hawaii or
[18:35.520 --> 18:43.200]  Colorado or Utah whether it's Democrat or Republican the anti-incumbent wins
[18:43.200 --> 18:47.360]  the anti-establishment person wins the person that isn't seen as the
[18:47.360 --> 18:53.200]  establishment candidate wins in every race that's why they've got
[18:53.200 --> 18:57.040]  establishment people posing as anti-establishment running against the
[18:57.040 --> 19:03.000]  two sisters you know the two globalist senators they're not really sisters but
[19:03.000 --> 19:09.400]  spiritually they are financially they are globally they are big government
[19:09.400 --> 19:13.160]  anti-gun they are in California of course they'll have Republican oids like
[19:13.160 --> 19:19.320]  Schwarzenegger types getting elected as the new female senators because every
[19:19.320 --> 19:24.640]  incumbent is falling every person running in primaries as a pro-establishment
[19:24.640 --> 19:28.160]  person is falling but what do you see out of all the establishment Republican
[19:28.160 --> 19:32.800]  organs who attack me every day Washington Post today they say Republicans
[19:32.800 --> 19:36.280]  better watch it they better mediate their message they better not sound like
[19:36.280 --> 19:41.720]  Alex Jones that's in the Washington Post and four other big publications I saw
[19:41.720 --> 19:47.040]  today as saying don't be like Alex Jones yeah because if you talked like me
[19:47.040 --> 19:52.880]  you'd win and nothing could stop you if you just told the truth people want
[19:52.880 --> 19:57.800]  hardcore reality they want angry people they want to take their country back so

[24:00.280 --> 24:14.400]  yeah before we know it another generation will pass like a rustle in the leaves in
[24:14.400 --> 24:23.600]  the autumn before you know all be in the catacomb the graveyard or ashes poured
[24:23.600 --> 24:34.960]  into the sea and will the world cup victor of 2010 matter then or will the
[24:34.960 --> 24:41.960]  course we chart for humanity that's being decided right now will that be what
[24:41.960 --> 24:49.400]  is remembered I want to have an effect on the future I have a love affair with
[24:49.400 --> 24:53.400]  the past the present and the future I want future generations to have more
[24:53.400 --> 25:01.640]  liberty than I've had more freedom than I've had unless that's what it's really
[25:01.640 --> 25:08.760]  all about and all the great thinkers the great philosophers the sages have come
[25:08.760 --> 25:14.680]  to that realization and to see that great truth robbed from modern humanity to
[25:14.680 --> 25:19.400]  see us turned into these creatures these slaves of media diversions is a sad
[25:19.400 --> 25:24.600]  thing your calls coming up the next segment what the good news is black
[25:24.600 --> 25:30.600]  Republican elected in South Carolina or won the primary now up against the
[25:30.600 --> 25:37.520]  Democrats and he trounced the Republican he was running against 69%
[25:37.520 --> 25:44.520]  because he's the anti-establishment person he's the pro-t party in the
[25:44.520 --> 25:50.760]  feather just like Rand Paul and they'll probably come out and claim that you
[25:50.760 --> 25:55.040]  know representative Tim Scott doesn't like black people because he's black I
[25:55.040 --> 25:58.920]  mean or they may put a white guy up on TV and tell people that's him that he
[25:58.920 --> 26:01.640]  wants to get rid of the civil rights act I mean there's no telling the type of
[26:01.640 --> 26:07.080]  hoaxes I'm not joking here they may just put up a white guy on TV on MSNBC and
[26:07.080 --> 26:11.640]  say I mean they'll go that far they put fake bin Laden videos out they want it
[26:11.640 --> 26:17.560]  to be about racial politics because if black people and Hispanics and other
[26:17.560 --> 26:20.880]  so-called minority groups Americans you're told you're a minority you're
[26:20.880 --> 26:26.640]  told to stay separate and a lot of it's a self-fulfilling prophecy where then
[26:26.640 --> 26:29.880]  blacks and others don't feel like they're welcome at a tea party and then
[26:29.880 --> 26:33.060]  finally after a year and a half of the media saying this if they show up at a
[26:33.060 --> 26:36.640]  tea party or any type of any other political demonstration people may then
[26:36.640 --> 26:40.520]  look at them and feel uncomfortable because all they've been told all day is
[26:40.520 --> 26:43.640]  that they're a white racist and so they're sitting there thinking does this
[26:43.640 --> 26:51.080]  black person think I don't like them and then people are uncomfortable instead of
[26:51.080 --> 26:55.640]  talking about JP Morgan Chase instead of talking about Goldman Sachs ripping a
[26:55.640 --> 26:59.600]  saw instead of talking about impending war with Iran getting closer and closer
[26:59.600 --> 27:07.240]  every second no we're all obsessed on our gender and our region and our
[27:07.240 --> 27:12.400]  religion and how much melanin we have in our skin and they teach it in school in
[27:12.400 --> 27:17.840]  the name of diversity to teach the little kids to actually see each other's
[27:17.840 --> 27:25.040]  differences and and and and feel guilty so that then the state can referee all
[27:25.040 --> 27:30.560]  of the gang mentality tribalism that's accentuated
[27:30.560 --> 27:37.240]  oh it's all very craftily done but the system is panicking every establishment
[27:37.240 --> 27:40.000]  candidate when they've had off elections in the last year and a half has been
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.240]  swept out and in every primary the anti-establishment candidate be they
[27:44.240 --> 27:48.560]  Democrat or Republican is winning the primaries and because the Republicans
[27:48.560 --> 27:52.320]  are seen as being out of power now when they run these anti-establishment
[27:52.320 --> 27:55.640]  Democrats and anti-establishment Republicans up against each other in
[27:55.640 --> 27:59.520]  November you're gonna see Republicans sweep probably get the Senate guaranteed
[27:59.520 --> 28:09.320]  to get the house unless Obama and his handlers stage a new Iran war or a big
[28:09.320 --> 28:15.360]  false flag or continue to let the Gulf degenerate and they may do all three or
[28:15.360 --> 28:20.640]  more they've got all sorts of curveballs up their sleeve they're up there at the
[28:20.640 --> 28:31.920]  mound the American people are up at bat will we fall for all their tricks it's
[28:31.920 --> 28:34.720]  real simple it's kind of like the American people are a golfer getting up
[28:34.720 --> 28:39.440]  to tea and Chris Matthews under his breath you know coughs and then says the
[28:39.440 --> 28:43.960]  n-word right before the black golfer hits the ball to try to make the black
[28:43.960 --> 28:51.320]  golfer get flustered it's all distractions it's all diversions it's all
[28:51.320 --> 28:57.360]  sabotage tricks little hoaxes little manipulations by a pack of crooks that
[28:57.360 --> 29:00.960]  run the Republican and Democratic parties and who are losing control at
[29:00.960 --> 29:05.040]  every level and so that's why they've rammed the accelerator down to the
[29:05.040 --> 29:12.080]  metal and they are committed so the battle is joined look at this
[29:12.080 --> 29:18.560]  Blagojevich wanted to get a good gig in DC Chicago two news reports let's come
[29:18.560 --> 29:23.960]  out in court and he's saying that it was all with Axelrod and Obama and
[29:23.960 --> 29:29.800]  Emmanuel well of course I mean again it's on record that Emmanuel had BP
[29:29.800 --> 29:35.800]  paying for his expensive apartment for years totally illegal I mean they're a
[29:35.800 --> 29:41.040]  pack of Chicago mafia the most brazen I mean they make Richard Nixon look like
[29:41.040 --> 29:45.240]  a choir boy I want to come back go to your calls and I'll get in all the rest

[32:03.520 --> 32:07.720]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[32:07.720 --> 32:12.000]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[32:12.000 --> 32:16.000]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[32:16.000 --> 32:20.440]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[32:20.440 --> 32:24.680]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[32:24.680 --> 32:28.440]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[32:28.440 --> 32:32.560]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[32:32.560 --> 32:36.520]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[32:36.520 --> 32:40.360]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I

[33:18.560 --> 33:23.520]  government is not allowing sand berms and so much a talk radio on the media is
[33:23.520 --> 33:29.320]  acting like this is new I remember a week into this the states and counties
[33:29.320 --> 33:33.680]  were trying to put berms up to block the estuaries in wetlands and the feds
[33:33.680 --> 33:37.600]  where they're telling them no I mean this has been going on for 60 days at
[33:37.600 --> 33:43.120]  least I mean this was going on a couple days into the event and what is it day

[34:11.280 --> 34:17.120]  Barack H. Obama is such an important film to be seen because people are now
[34:17.120 --> 34:24.800]  really ready to see this guy for what he is and by understanding Obama you then
[34:24.800 --> 34:27.840]  shot of the left-right paradigm and understand how these offshore banks of
[34:27.840 --> 34:32.800]  corporations through private intelligence mole networks have taken
[34:32.800 --> 34:37.560]  control of our government in our society and how these elites brag about
[34:37.560 --> 34:43.400]  their unelected power over our society so this is America's last stand for all
[34:43.400 --> 34:47.160]  the republic documents how an offshore corporate cartel is bankrupting the u.s.
[34:47.160 --> 34:50.640]  economy by design our leaders are now declaring that world government has
[34:50.640 --> 34:53.760]  arrived that the dollar will be replaced with a new global currency
[34:53.760 --> 34:57.160]  president Obama has brazenly violated article one section out of the u.s.
[34:57.160 --> 35:00.400]  constitution by seating himself at the head of the United Nations Security
[35:00.400 --> 35:04.000]  Council thus becoming the first u.s. president to chair the world body a
[35:04.000 --> 35:07.640]  scientific dictatorship is in its final stages of completion and laws protecting
[35:07.640 --> 35:12.520]  basic human rights are being abolished worldwide an iron curtain of high-tech
[35:12.520 --> 35:16.600]  tyranny is now descending over the planet a worldwide regime controlled by an
[35:16.600 --> 35:21.400]  unelected corporate elite is implementing a planetary carbon tax system that will
[35:21.400 --> 35:26.240]  dominate all human activity and establish a system of neo-futile slavery the
[35:26.240 --> 35:29.760]  image makers have carefully packaged Obama's the world's savior he is the
[35:29.760 --> 35:33.480]  Trojan horse manufactured to pass by the people just long enough for the global
[35:33.480 --> 35:36.600]  is to complete their master plan this film reveals the architecture of the
[35:36.600 --> 35:39.400]  new world order and what the power elite have in store for humanity more
[35:39.400 --> 35:43.160]  importantly it communicates how we the people can retake control of our
[35:43.160 --> 35:47.840]  government turn the criminal tide and bring the tyrants to justice it's got

[37:31.160 --> 37:35.240]  question ready I will attempt to not belabor and comment too long on what you
[37:35.240 --> 37:39.120]  have to say because I do want to try to get as many people as possible Wayne in
[37:39.120 --> 37:44.040]  Missouri you're on the air thanks for holding yes alex hello good good talk
[37:44.040 --> 37:47.880]  to you I've been about a ten-year listener first time I've ever been able
[37:47.880 --> 37:53.760]  to get through welcome I was listening to the power hour this morning and they
[37:53.760 --> 37:59.760]  had a geologist on talking about the golf oil thing and he was talking about
[37:59.760 --> 38:06.080]  old oil and new oil yeah abiotic oil and then the oil that comes from dead
[38:06.080 --> 38:11.840]  plant animal life right like fossil fuel but he was saying if it's old oil
[38:11.840 --> 38:17.600]  fossil fuel it may run three four six months but if it's the other kind of
[38:17.600 --> 38:23.760]  oil he said it could go forever because it's just being created right now well
[38:23.760 --> 38:28.120]  generally ten thousand footwells fifteen thousand footwells eighteen thousand
[38:28.120 --> 38:35.440]  twenty thousand and on generally they do end up running dry or at least slowing
[38:35.440 --> 38:40.360]  they they have a really kind of a parabolic growth rate a whole bunch at
[38:40.360 --> 38:44.560]  first for a year or two and then slowing down over a decade that's the average
[38:44.560 --> 38:49.480]  from the research I've done I'm no expert but I've tried to research it but
[38:49.480 --> 38:52.800]  yes they do believe more and more geologists that there are abiotic
[38:52.800 --> 38:57.880]  areas and that's why so many of the old wells drilled in the United States in
[38:57.880 --> 39:02.640]  Europe that were drilled 50 years ago 70 years ago 100 years ago are filling
[39:02.640 --> 39:07.200]  back up and so a more and more evidence shows that there is such a thing as
[39:07.200 --> 39:12.360]  fossil fuel there is fossil oil but there's also and fossil coal but there's
[39:12.360 --> 39:16.680]  also abiotic and so that's a really good point you make and we've covered that
[39:16.680 --> 39:21.240]  anything else Wayne know that he'd just be a good guess to get on because he knew
[39:21.240 --> 39:24.960]  what he was talking about and I've heard you kind of touch on it in the past what
[39:24.960 --> 39:29.160]  was his name what was his name because that means oil companies are lying to us
[39:29.160 --> 39:33.840]  forever about running out sure what was his name it was Chris something's on the
[39:33.840 --> 39:37.240]  power I'll look into it sir I appreciate it
[39:37.240 --> 39:42.920]  alright thank you let's talk to Ronald in Texas Ronald you're on the air hey
[39:42.920 --> 39:47.520]  Alex Jones first-time caller I'm really happy to be on the air with you hey I
[39:47.520 --> 39:53.960]  have a funny analogy with this general McCrystal situation going on yes I just
[39:53.960 --> 39:58.680]  moved and I wasn't used to the shower getting out of the shower here and I
[39:58.680 --> 40:03.120]  slipped yesterday and cracked my toe on the edge of the shower and just buzzed
[40:03.120 --> 40:07.740]  it all up is all black and blue today well I'd like to use this for an
[40:07.740 --> 40:14.040]  analogy of breaking the anatomy of Barack Obama with the thousands cuts
[40:14.040 --> 40:19.800]  method here and and I think in the long run we're gonna be okay because this
[40:19.800 --> 40:24.800]  McCrystal guy here he kind of exemplifies what's gonna happen in the
[40:24.800 --> 40:30.200]  future if they're trying to come take our guns and whatnot here in the the
[40:30.200 --> 40:35.240]  states I mean they're just gonna turn on him basically when they he starts
[40:35.240 --> 40:41.160]  making demands that don't make sense to these ground troops who have real kind
[40:41.160 --> 40:44.880]  of real bearing here with the United States and live here their whole lives
[40:44.880 --> 40:50.360]  and know how it really should be and how it has been in the past well I'll say
[40:50.360 --> 40:58.280]  this I have studied McCrystal the last year and a half I was aware of his bio
[40:58.280 --> 41:03.480]  before he was appointed the head of the Afghan operation and of course we saw
[41:03.480 --> 41:08.400]  that first meeting with McCrystal and Obama on Air Force One and it was
[41:08.400 --> 41:12.120]  reported that it was an uncomfortable meeting Obama has always been
[41:12.120 --> 41:18.000]  uncomfortable around military brass because he's a feminine he's fake and
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.640]  I mean I could care less being in a room with a bunch of generals I don't
[41:20.640 --> 41:26.160]  impress me and but you know these I mean look Obama was probably never even
[41:26.160 --> 41:32.000]  allowed and from what I've read to have a BB gun much less a firearm and so he
[41:32.000 --> 41:36.560]  was brought up by parents who were openly communist working of course for
[41:36.560 --> 41:43.800]  big banking foundations and so all of these people are incredibly domesticated
[41:43.800 --> 41:47.960]  it's like that British documentary maker who came down here for Chris Matthews
[41:47.960 --> 41:53.680]  interview me she saw a gun under my broadcast desk on a shelf this is my
[41:53.680 --> 41:57.160]  studio I'm here I protect myself I'm not living in fear I'm not gonna get on my
[41:57.160 --> 42:01.080]  knees or somebody comes in here after me you know some some type of criminal thug
[42:01.080 --> 42:04.600]  or something or some nut I'm gonna defend myself and she began hyperventilating
[42:04.600 --> 42:09.240]  got scared couldn't talk tears started coming out of her eyes like she was so
[42:09.240 --> 42:14.520]  scared like she'd seen a ghost or Freddy Krueger and after about a minute
[42:14.520 --> 42:23.920]  she's went a gun it was a famous case of Ron Silver Hollywood person at Bill
[42:23.920 --> 42:28.720]  Clinton's inauguration back in the early 90s and right in front of a news
[42:28.720 --> 42:32.960]  reporter he said I can't believe they have f 616s flying over us that's
[42:32.960 --> 42:36.600]  threatening towards us that's how disconnected you know kind of the foot
[42:36.600 --> 42:41.240]  soldiers are not the higher-level globalist controllers but they create
[42:41.240 --> 42:47.120]  these domesticated slaves and then turn them loose and Hillary turned to him
[42:47.120 --> 42:51.320]  right in front of the Washington Post reporter and said those are our jets
[42:51.320 --> 43:02.360]  now and so they are really scared of guns of uniforms of anything because they
[43:02.360 --> 43:08.960]  think that the uniform is is is like attached to the gun and and and so I
[43:08.960 --> 43:12.320]  mean these are really I mean look at Elena Kagan I mean this woman looks
[43:12.320 --> 43:20.800]  like a character of an evil goblin look at Obama he looks like he's plastic or
[43:20.800 --> 43:27.680]  something like like a space alien Obama doesn't look human because he's used so
[43:27.680 --> 43:33.080]  many drugs and well other things but look side issue I appreciate your call I
[43:33.080 --> 43:38.840]  mean I don't know what I can really say about McCrystal McCrystal is corrupt
[43:38.840 --> 43:45.960]  period I mean you just go bad to worse with these politicians and generals now
[43:45.960 --> 43:51.680]  Admiral Fox Fallon three years ago it came out did refuse to launch a
[43:51.680 --> 43:56.240]  preemptive nuclear strike on more than a hundred different sites
[43:56.240 --> 44:00.720]  some were regular conventional bunker busters others were to be quote pinpoint
[44:00.720 --> 44:07.000]  nuke many nuke bunker buster attacks he refused and resigned and the way he
[44:07.000 --> 44:12.480]  resigned without making it a bigger hubbub is he gave an interview to Esquire
[44:12.480 --> 44:20.720]  and criticized Bush and then resigned and I don't like to come out and say
[44:20.720 --> 44:25.800]  something just to dare to into it without having proof but but we have
[44:25.800 --> 44:29.560]  enough evidence of how this has been done in the past instead of say being a
[44:29.560 --> 44:33.880]  Roman general who's disgraced and committing a sepico I guess the
[44:33.880 --> 44:37.680]  Japanese call it that ritual suicide the Romans did that before the Japanese by
[44:37.680 --> 44:42.800]  the way with the dagger to the stomach or they'd have their second their aid to
[44:42.800 --> 44:47.040]  camp drive a sword down over their shoulder in between their shoulder blades
[44:47.040 --> 44:50.280]  into their heart on the left side that was another way or they'd have one of
[44:50.280 --> 44:54.320]  their aids chop their head off just oh well I've been disgraced here chopped my
[44:54.320 --> 44:57.840]  head off because they knew how quick life was it was really no big deal oh time
[44:57.840 --> 45:05.480]  to die you know but now they don't do that they don't commit sepico they don't
[45:05.480 --> 45:09.400]  jab a dagger into their lower abdomen and pull it up into the heart that's part
[45:09.400 --> 45:12.320]  of the tough guy and is that you're able to stick the knife in on the right hand
[45:12.320 --> 45:18.080]  side of your stomach draw it through the liver the spleen the kidneys touch the
[45:18.080 --> 45:21.520]  back of the spine and then jerk upwards with the dagger into the left hand side
[45:21.520 --> 45:24.600]  under the rib cage if you're a real man you're you're able to complete the cut
[45:24.600 --> 45:27.960]  slowly and jab it up I mean that's what people used to be like look at the
[45:27.960 --> 45:31.760]  domesticated people we are today I mean I'm not saying that's a good thing I'm
[45:31.760 --> 45:35.440]  just you know the Japanese showing off on how they could gut themselves properly
[45:35.440 --> 45:38.800]  and then if they had a problem someone stood behind them and chopped their head
[45:38.800 --> 45:44.680]  off but side issue generals don't do that anymore and like the Greek women
[45:44.680 --> 45:50.960]  would say to the Spartan men come home with your shields are on them that has
[45:50.960 --> 45:54.200]  come back victorious don't turn and run because of armies turn and ran they've
[45:54.200 --> 45:57.800]  dropped their their weapons to be able to get away quicker come home with your
[45:57.800 --> 46:02.240]  shields are on them so that's what humans are folks not these domesticated
[46:02.240 --> 46:10.120]  jellyfish that we've become all right I'm digressing the way these generals tend
[46:10.120 --> 46:14.720]  to commit sepico now is with a parting shot claiming it's an accident and they
[46:14.720 --> 46:20.600]  find the biggest publication they can esquire rolling stone and they play these
[46:20.600 --> 46:24.560]  liberal leftists they I mean McCrystal's never made a mistake like this in his
[46:24.560 --> 46:28.760]  decades of being an officer and they let them come in and hear the disdainful
[46:28.760 --> 46:32.120]  comments about Obama and all of his effeminate servants and whole brook
[46:32.120 --> 46:39.160]  dithering and being a mentally ill coward and all of this and and pointing out
[46:39.160 --> 46:42.680]  that if we're gonna be there we need more troops to win this just like in
[46:42.680 --> 46:46.320]  Vietnam generals would say you're not there to win it McCrystal you're there
[46:46.320 --> 46:50.560]  to be in a long protracted quagmire to sit on top the 500 billion a year and
[46:50.560 --> 46:57.280]  smack the opium the heroin the good stuff being shipped all over the world
[46:57.280 --> 47:01.920]  and McCrystal the word I got from military actually and this is from
[47:01.920 --> 47:06.800]  different sources did not like that get Anthony Schaefer on he even talked
[47:06.800 --> 47:10.440]  about this what three four months ago with us McCrystal is and then the whole
[47:10.440 --> 47:13.840]  army doesn't like the CIA taking over the army and taking over the drones and
[47:13.840 --> 47:18.040]  doesn't like the fact that contractors are above them or making five times on
[47:18.040 --> 47:21.960]  average what they are and that they have all this anonymity and that they can get
[47:21.960 --> 47:25.480]  away with murder but then the military punches somebody in the nose they've
[47:25.480 --> 47:30.400]  captured because the person tried to RPG them you know they go to prison they
[47:30.400 --> 47:34.520]  know the CIA and the contractors are basically trying to get rid of the army
[47:34.520 --> 47:39.800]  and the Air Force and the Marines and turn them into bastard kind of minor
[47:39.800 --> 47:43.560]  leagues for the big league they know there's a private mercenary takeover
[47:43.560 --> 47:47.960]  and McCrystal criticize that and he criticized it in the Rolling Stone thing
[47:47.960 --> 47:51.120]  McCrystal knew full well what was going to happen okay that much we're sure of
[47:51.120 --> 47:55.120]  and we got an article up on prisonplanet.com Watson just did that has
[47:55.120 --> 48:00.280]  all the quotes and boil down analysis if you want to be able to you know really
[48:00.280 --> 48:04.080]  see it for yourself but I was gonna get it in McCrystal next hour but I'm
[48:04.080 --> 48:09.640]  already going off into it right now but I'll cover it more next hour as I have
[48:09.640 --> 48:15.440]  promised promised to do right now let's talk to Beverly in Missouri Beverly
[48:15.440 --> 48:21.280]  you're on the air hi Alex I'm how you doing I'm doing I have a question about
[48:21.280 --> 48:27.480]  some unemployment extensions I heard that there'll be 1.2 million people
[48:27.480 --> 48:34.480]  unemployed by June 26 and that our senator here in McCaskill says that she
[48:34.480 --> 48:42.200]  considers it an entitlement and that she says this can't go on forever I'm in my
[48:42.200 --> 48:46.720]  60s and I can't find a job I've been unemployed for about two years now and
[48:46.720 --> 48:52.400]  what I kept thinking of is this 1.2 million people just think of 1.2
[48:52.400 --> 48:55.920]  million people that are losing their homes and can't pay their bills and what
[48:55.920 --> 49:00.640]  that does to our economy well man number one everything they put out as a
[49:00.640 --> 49:04.200]  distortion we've had top economists on from one end of the spectrum to the
[49:04.200 --> 49:11.960]  other Robini Faber Paul Craig Roberts Ron Paul's an economist not just a
[49:11.960 --> 49:20.240]  medical doctor he's out of on misdegree the issue is that when they tell you
[49:20.240 --> 49:28.280]  it's 9.8 it was 23 points a year ago it's well over 25 now now what's 25% of
[49:28.280 --> 49:32.080]  working Americans let's say there's a hundred and 80 million or so people that
[49:32.080 --> 49:39.480]  are working age 18 to 64 roughly now you got a hundred plus million people let's
[49:39.480 --> 49:44.240]  just say a hundred million let's not say 160 180 the statistics vary let's say
[49:44.240 --> 49:48.560]  there's a hundred million working people what's 20% of a hundred million is 20
[49:48.560 --> 49:52.360]  million so there's at least 20 million people that's a very conservative
[49:52.360 --> 49:55.920]  member let's take the government number let's say of a hundred million there's
[49:55.920 --> 50:02.800]  9.8 well that's that's 9,800,000 people that are unemployed or
[50:02.800 --> 50:10.800]  underemployed we work two three four jobs this is all by design and it isn't
[50:10.800 --> 50:13.600]  really an entitlement to a certain point because you have paid into it your

[54:11.440 --> 54:15.440]  deindustrialized the country they've gotten us dependent their open stated
[54:15.440 --> 54:20.960]  goal is to destroy the industrialized society so the people are so poor they
[54:20.960 --> 54:25.640]  can't even afford to have families or children and have a social network of
[54:25.640 --> 54:29.640]  social services that if you are poor they then will take your children I mean
[54:29.640 --> 54:33.240]  this is pure bonded this is the end of the family the human the end of the

[54:51.200 --> 54:55.280]  playing god Beverly and I'm sorry that they want to take away your unemployment
[54:55.280 --> 55:00.120]  benefits the thing that I found was unusual is that it's on the Republican
[55:00.120 --> 55:04.720]  side unanimously and now the Democrats are coming over and voting for it too
[55:04.720 --> 55:09.480]  because they say there's no funding but then they turn around and a senator is
[55:09.480 --> 55:13.240]  trying to make it so that if you are unemployment that you have to be drug
[55:13.240 --> 55:17.160]  tested so I'm trying to figure out whether they're getting all this money to do
[55:17.160 --> 55:21.400]  all these other programs and to set up all these other other things but they
[55:21.400 --> 55:30.000]  won't pay the people the money they need to pay their bills well I did see the
[55:30.000 --> 55:37.320]  provision where they want to drug test everyone and notice how that works oh you
[55:37.320 --> 55:40.680]  can stay on unemployment even though you can't get a job and we destroyed your
[55:40.680 --> 55:45.120]  industrial capacity and we've got tens of trillions of foreign banks but you've
[55:45.120 --> 55:50.120]  got to be drug tested you've got to have a home inspection oh in the future you're
[55:50.120 --> 55:54.000]  not gonna be able to have a single family home dwelling those will be illegal
[55:54.000 --> 55:59.240]  you've got to live in a government dormitory this is just complete
[55:59.240 --> 56:05.520]  enslavement and I appreciate your call you know most radio shows kind of follow
[56:05.520 --> 56:11.320]  whatever the big news is and we only follow what the big news is whatever the
[56:11.320 --> 56:18.320]  media is telling us is the most important issue when I think it's
[56:18.320 --> 56:24.280]  actually important and the mccrystal situation is somewhat important just
[56:24.280 --> 56:27.480]  because even the mainstream media is admitting this could shake up the entire
[56:27.480 --> 56:33.640]  war you notice they announced two days ago that oh we're not gonna have a
[56:33.640 --> 56:38.960]  pullout date listed in 2011 we're gonna go ahead and basically stay
[56:38.960 --> 56:43.600]  indefinitely now just like iraq but the guys were just waving their arms
[56:43.600 --> 56:48.960]  telling me there's a press conference going on what's the word on that
[56:51.560 --> 56:55.880]  okay so yeah coming up in about 35 minutes general Stanley mccrystal
[56:55.880 --> 57:03.680]  tenders his resignation that's breaking and it's all a diversion or it turns the
[57:03.680 --> 57:06.920]  war into a so proper I mean it's like this thing a week ago about we found a
[57:06.920 --> 57:12.560]  trillion in lithium we're all rich and it turns out it was in 1980s geological

[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:34.520]  day of June 2010 edition we had to reschedule last week dr. John Coleman
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:39.440]  he'll be on with us in the fourth hour today always informative we're
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.760]  continuing with your phone calls in 30 minutes there's a macrystal press
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:48.520]  conference and all of this serves a larger purpose as if Obama is commanding
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:53.600]  a general and Obama's the boss and macrystal actually runs something the
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:57.720]  buck stops with the generals in the White House and now you've got big
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:02.800]  unelected bureaucracies and private corporate networks like the CFR that
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:08.200]  openly Hillary Clinton's admitted this tell the presidency what to do they had
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:12.840]  an SPP meeting and they've had a bunch of them and through four year request we've
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:17.080]  gotten the documents over the years and they have North American Union meetings
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:21.240]  and it's the Fortune 100 or so there and they just openly tell the government
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:26.640]  what to do and the government clicks its heels because all the major politicians
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:32.000]  and bureaucracy heads previously worked for Monsanto and General Electric and
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:41.920]  News Corp and BP and Exxon Mobile and Goldman Sachs and so when you have these
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:45.480]  big corporate committee meetings that's what global governance is I mean now
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:48.880]  they open to say a world bank a world government where you pay your taxes
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:57.480]  directly to the IMF and World Bank and so I see these people out there saying oh
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:02.480]  there's a trillion dollars of lithium in Afghanistan that's why we're there oh
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:06.600]  really we've been there eight years 500 billion a year conservatively an opium
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:13.440]  coming out how many trillions is that four trillion trillions in oil in the
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:18.480]  area trillions of natural gas they've known for decades there was lithium
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:24.560]  there World Bank reports 2003 they just tell you that in the New York Times tells
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:31.040]  you that's gonna pay for the war really we're now in Iraq almost seven years or
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:36.040]  not almost I guess in March it was seven and the Communist Chinese are getting
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:40.120]  the oil wells the French are getting the oil wells kind of like Obama gave
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:44.320]  billions of dollars to a Brazilian oil company partly owned by George Soros
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:52.240]  who financing stimulus money Wall Street Journal that was back in 2009 by the way
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:57.720]  there's no ban on them drilling in the Gulf see Obama controls America and so
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:02.320]  globalist control America and so they shut America down all of their holdings
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:07.960]  outside of America go up in value all of their global corporate extraction
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:15.840]  mechanisms that extract oil minerals drugs whatever the case is by by by NAFTA
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:19.880]  and GATT and globalism and carbon taxes shutting down Europe in the United
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:24.160]  States that makes all these robber barons that got rich off of our nations
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:27.560]  and our nation's funding their private corporate empire they then have
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:30.760]  leveraged that out to take over the world and now they're just shutting
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:35.160]  America off to make their holdings outside the country go up and so my
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:40.640]  heart goes out to Beverly in Missouri who can't find a job whose unemployment is
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:44.000]  about to run out and now the government saying in Congress well we'll let you

[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:29.560]  hello mr. Jones how are you good my friend I was just curious just wondering
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:36.080]  what you think about you're you're a really well-informed person and you're
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.680]  one of the most intelligent people I know and I've been listening to your
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:42.200]  show for about two years and actually have been really well-informed by you
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:45.640]  and and you really are where I get most of my news but I do some independent
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:49.440]  research as well yeah you shouldn't just get your news from info wars.com and
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:53.640]  prisonplanet.com you should get a wide spectrum you can learn a lot too just by
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:57.320]  watching enemy transmissions the corporate occupation well government
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:04.040]  media you can really learn what their what their game plan is well sir I was
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:09.720]  wondering what do you see I mean from you from all of your sources and all the
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:14.240]  information that you've been able to put together so far where do you actually
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:21.320]  see all this globalist stuff going I mean what what is their absolute plan
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:25.640]  that you have seen and as far as this this thing in the Gulf and and
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:32.040]  everything else our our monetary system our economic collapse all this well
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:38.640]  that's a big big question I appreciate your call how do you simplify that I
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:42.000]  mean I said day one when they had the spill I said whether it's staged or a
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.720]  real accident they're not gonna let a good crisis go to waste they're gonna
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:49.440]  try to ram through cap and trade and now they're on the news every day so and
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:53.960]  we've got to put taxes on you we've got a tax and regulate your home and have
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:59.320]  home inspections we've got to have more government power and all the evidence
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:02.640]  shows it's back in the news today that they're not letting the states put up
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:07.480]  sand berms mostly oil hasn't come in yet to shore if you look at the satellite
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:13.640]  images from NASA and so it's just horrible and so the plan is order out of
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:18.160]  chaos wreck everything and then always play the part of the saviors getting
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:25.840]  more control over society via the destruction they've wrought basically a
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:33.920]  scientific nightmare a scientific dictatorship that's what Paul Ehrlich the
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:37.200]  chief advisor to George Bush senior said they would do that's what Obama's
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:40.640]  White House science are said they would do John P. Holdren I mean this is what
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:46.960]  these people do these are conquerors they're economic and scientific
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:50.440]  conquerors and they come in and they study how humans operate now societies
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:53.920]  develop and they write countless books about it and you could see their entire
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:11:01.200]  program being implemented to turn us into completely domesticated animals not
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:07.440]  to even carry out a specific job not to provide milk not to provide wool not to
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:14.360]  even provide meat but to be domesticated for the orderly process of
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:19.720]  incremental generational extermination and so they're eradicating the family
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:25.560]  system they're eradicating the national system the sovereign system they are
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:30.080]  waging I mean I told you a decade ago globalist documents said under
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:33.480]  environmental rules we would all be raised in dormitories and that the
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.400]  family would be broken up and that you wouldn't be able to have single family
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:40.360]  dwelling homes and new homes couldn't be built and now that's been passed as law
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:45.760]  in Europe they're now trying to implement I mean it's all happening
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:50.880]  everything you read in 1984 is what they actually planned George Arwell was a
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:56.040]  member of MI sex real name was Eric Blair when are people gonna figure out
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:59.600]  that Aldous Huxley before he died went clean and said this whole thing is a
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:05.880]  real plan it's a eugenics transhumanist program he wrote Brave New World in 33
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:09.920]  or everybody's genetically engineered and the state decides what genetics you
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:14.640]  can have and if you can have a kid and they've got subclasses that serve them
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:21.320]  you know more than half the births in Hollywood now are surrogates I've been
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:25.760]  at soccer games that my kids are playing in and basketball games and things and
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:30.360]  heard mothers talking about their surrogate babies and I mean you know
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:35.360]  these are middle-class people having them they're already growing hearts and
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:41.200]  livers and in clones but it's okay because it's not a humanoid clone they
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:46.920]  mix bovine with the human fetus and then grow it in utero in the in the cows
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:51.560]  that's been going on for at least 12 years and it's in all the medical
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:56.280]  literature it's all going on I mean things you can't even imagine are going
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:59.760]  on ladies and gentlemen you're living in a Buck Rogers system but it's a
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:10.400]  technocratic psycho system but meanwhile the average person only cares about the
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:14.120]  latest soap opera you know the the political classes kind of have dumbed
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:18.280]  down political soap operas McCrystal Rahm Emanuel Blagojevic
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:22.800]  Barack Obama that's just one level they're just mid-level puppets the real
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:26.520]  power structure rarely gets looked at more and more it is so Brzezinski's
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:33.040]  panicked five weeks ago and raised the alarm and told his CFR crowd you know
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:38.440]  look out the public can see us now but most people aren't even tuned into the
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:44.080]  fake political strata of Obama and Newt Gingrich and all these people who are on
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:49.800]  the same team they're tuned into American Idol and the World Cup and
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:53.560]  Marinus Vanderloom or
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:59.760]  Marinus Vanderloom's the guy that reportedly firebombed the Reichstag I
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:04.280]  get it all mixed up who's the who's the guy they're saying killed the the girl
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:09.920]  in South America and before that they said he killed the woman in the Caribbean
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:15.000]  you're in Vander sleuth I just all right I said I'd go to your calls there
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.680]  there we go let's talk to a John in California you're on the air good
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:25.600]  good afternoon Marfius actually have a few topics for you this morning and the
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:29.800]  first thing is actually something I've not heard you talk about so I really
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:33.440]  think it's quite interesting you've been talking about these boxes that they're
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:38.400]  gonna put you know to help regulate the internet and from what I'm getting here
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:42.520]  I used to have a website that they got rid of it it's something that they're
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:47.360]  doing and it's attacking computers it's called anti-spyware soft let's that's
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:52.360]  at least one of two attacks that I've been gone under and basically what this
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:57.960]  is don't doing it seems to me as if like these boxes are just more like a decoy
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:02.080]  all right and what they're really doing is what I'm about to tell you they had
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:07.440]  it they had a sort of a website up that you could go to because it's supposed to
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:11.680]  act like some kind of anti-spyware system that you could buy and it will protect
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:16.120]  your computer but in reality it's a Trojan horse and what it does well so
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:21.320]  that's not your opinion I have the age newspaper out of Australia and the news
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:25.440]  newspaper both reporting that the government makes people not put a black
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:32.360]  box in an Australia this is now law but quote anti-spam software and what it
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:37.240]  blocks is tens of thousands of URLs like info wars dot com and prison planet
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:41.760]  dot com and that software dials into a central government hub and takes
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:47.000]  control of your computer here the FCC has announced a black box that does it
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.880]  so what you just said is actually what's going on the thing is Alex the
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:56.600]  first time it happened to me it was called the lozac called the scope
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:01.040]  security tool and the second time is called anti-spyware soft I would manage
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:05.760]  the copy their features page I wrote it down and let me just read a few of the
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:10.240]  things that it says it says right there on the features page the anti-spyware
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:16.040]  soft only bolts a large number of enhanced features it says comprehensive
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:21.120]  scanning engine many spyware constantly renamed to avoid detection but their
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:25.320]  content remains the same anti-spyware soft carries out a comprehensive
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:31.000]  examination of not only the presence of quote-unquote suspicious files but also
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:36.680]  all traces of them in their content deep soft scan the registry memory all
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:42.880]  files all folders cookies in the window it doesn't just block websites or URLs
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:48.960]  it it blocks keywords yes and this is going to be federal law they've already
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:53.480]  put it in in Italy they're putting it in Australia and I was just trying to dig
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:57.720]  through my stack a moment ago but I'll try to find it during the break Watson
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:00.840]  an article about it yesterday no it's openly announced and the government
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:07.080]  admits it is the censor websites admit I mean they admit that it is to shut
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:11.800]  down the internet as we know it and cast Sunstein the Winehouse admits that and
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:20.760]  so yes these anti-spyware anti-spam anti-cookie systems look it's it's
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:26.280]  basically the same model of AOL remember AOL was so big a decade ago and it would
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:29.520]  give you the kindler gentler internet you would go log into their AOL
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:34.120]  interface you'd be on AOL's website it would have filters enabled so you
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:37.520]  couldn't go to bad places and the main thing it did was slow down your
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:43.160]  internet by about half and so now that's the biggest industry complaint about
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:47.600]  Cybersecurity Act is not that it snoops on people or restricts their content but
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:52.920]  that all of these pieces of software being put in by the FCC at the ISP and
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:58.640]  at the individual user level totally slows down the web so that's the third
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:04.320]  part it spies on everything you're doing it restricts what you're able to get
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:10.240]  access to but it's just like vaccine makers so many parents I've challenged
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:13.320]  when the school is trying to make their kid take shots they go actually read the
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:19.240]  insert and it will tell them oh guess what this vaccine doesn't even protect
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:24.000]  against papillomavirus or it doesn't even protect against diphtheria or it
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.800]  doesn't even protect it doesn't it's all lawyers speak most of these vaccines
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:34.200]  they say on the actual insert it doesn't even protect you and so you know as you
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:38.080]  said with these quote spy software systems but but it's more than that
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:42.920]  Google now will you see this more and more when you go to a website I'll say
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:47.120]  this website is dangerous this website is and I'm told that happens with info
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:51.920]  wars and prison planet and it's not true you know that we have cookies or
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:59.400]  whatever they are desperately trying to keep people away from the alternative
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:03.840]  media because they're panicking and what all of you should do is write blurbs
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:08.000]  write articles that have the facts that point out what's happening and send it
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.360]  to writers and info wars dot com or at least post it in the prison planet dot
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:17.000]  com forum millions of people every year read that site but remember last year
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000]  we covered it first and Glen Beck to his credit did pick up on it became
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:27.120]  national news that when you went to the cars cash for clunkers car government
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:30.880]  website it would have a message saying when you click here you agree to the
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:35.200]  federal government owning your computer and taking control of your computer and
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:38.680]  downloading the contents of your computer and tracking everything you do and
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:42.800]  that was the message see oh you want unemployment that you paid for we're
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:46.880]  gonna take your blood or urine and a drug test oh you want the cash for
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:50.320]  clunker we're gonna take your computer over and put snooping software on it
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:54.760]  oh you want to be able to fly you got to have a national ID card oh you want to
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:57.640]  go to National Park got a national ID card we'll be able to have a job and
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:03.360]  have an actual ID card it's total slavery what if your local grocery store

[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:19.200]  hello and thank you Alex it's an honor to be able to get through to you I just
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:26.200]  wanted to make a quick comment regarding your courageous attitude which is I
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:31.360]  think a key to the problems of the American people and now here's what I
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:37.320]  hear you saying and here's what I say to the New World Order and to Barack
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:43.960]  Obama I say that I stand for truth justice in the American way so go ahead
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:49.680]  and make my day now that's a combination of Superman and dirty Harry and I may
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:54.040]  have already gotten that from you but it has a tremendous impact in my
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:59.440]  conversations and it impacts on people and they understand we've got to get a
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:04.680]  winning attitude an angry attitude we've got to find our spine again and and and
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:08.960]  get out of this position of being cowed like a prostitute who's being beaten by
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:16.240]  a coat hanger by the pimp America is not a toothless prostitute crack whore on
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:24.400]  her last legs if we decide we're not exactly and what you do with your
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:30.040]  attitude which rubs off on your listeners such as myself is it even
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:35.320]  though you're accused of being a fear monger what you help us do enable us to
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:42.000]  do is to overcome fear well look I mean the media fear mongers and then tells
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.680]  you with false fear and tells you worship government I say you better be
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:50.720]  afraid of tyranny like our founding fathers said and take action against it
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:56.520]  or these offshore banks are going to not leave anything left of a republic and
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:00.680]  you know the question is have the issues I've talked about come true in the last
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:05.360]  decade and the answer is yes that's why our credibility has gone up the
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:09.440]  mainstream credibility has gone down we are becoming the mainstream the
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:13.960]  mainstream media is becoming what they are in the public's mind a pack of lying
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:18.480]  criminals Marty I appreciate your call we've got to get our fighting spirit
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:24.440]  back our spirit of 1776 and recognize how much corruption and tyranny is around
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:29.440]  us before it gets worse and as you notice the establishment knows we're
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:33.760]  waking up so they're now rushing to the finish line right now trying to get
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:38.520]  their oppressive system in place before it's too late for them I mean look at
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:43.080]  the whore you're nixing middle-class tax cuts says they're too expensive see you
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:47.960]  aren't going to get middle-class tax cuts like Obama said and now they've
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:52.120]  detailed what's in the health bill nobody's getting free health care they
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:58.080]  cut Medicare and Medicaid funding but put more people on it it lowers the
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:02.480]  standard of care the insurance companies wrote this the republicans told you the
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:06.840]  insurance companies could do no wrong and we're fighting Obama they wrote the
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:11.720]  bill just like republicans are saying Obama's being mean to BP that's all a
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:15.000]  sideshow they're one of his biggest financiers they're the king of the carbon
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  tax this is all stage ladies and gentlemen it's like a WWF match I'm
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:26.040]  sorry Hulk Hogan did not fight Andre the giant in WrestleMania 2 it's not real
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:29.640]  let's go ahead and talk to Steve in California you're on the air Steve
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:34.920]  hi Alex I really appreciate you taking my call I just had two points that I wanted
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:40.160]  to get to about the upcoming energy problems and the state of the economy
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:45.360]  and I'm I live in Sacramento I know you've touched a couple of times about
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:49.720]  how the government wants to control the thermostat in the houses now I think
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:52.800]  this leads right to what's going on in Europe well the government's announced
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:56.720]  that I mean I mean they're putting smart meters here in people's homes in
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:01.480]  Austin without asking well not only that is that if you can't have any new fire
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:05.320]  places if you build a new house and if you already have one that's right most
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:09.200]  European countries under EU rules have now faced that in special taxes on
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:13.480]  outdoor space heaters special taxes if you want to buy a little heater you know
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:18.800]  if you work in a shack or something you know during the winter anything that
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:25.080]  allows you to live is having taxes this is slavery right so when you when you
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:28.120]  tell people that they're gonna expect you know seven to eight dollar gas they
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:32.440]  go yes yes that's good we do need that we're using the dirty energy but people
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:36.600]  don't remember the Enron rolling blackouts where after 12 hours you had
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:40.360]  you had rushes on the grocery store just to get ice because your refrigerators
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:45.000]  weren't working in what happened the internal memos of Enron came out two
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  years later I told people at the time in 2000 I said this is stage they've done
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.120]  this in Africa and other countries it's in the IMF World Bank battle plan that
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:58.600]  is public that they've learned well look if we turn the power off a little bit
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:02.840]  people will accept double triple and even quadruple thinking there is none but
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:07.840]  if we just raise the prices they'll get mad and so we'll have staged blackouts
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:10.800]  and they even had members of the Congress and the legislature of
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:15.720]  California this is in on record and the secretary of the army he later went on
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:19.280]  Mr. White to be the secretary of the army Mr. White the Enron executive would
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:24.720]  give them hundreds of fake tours showing them fake computer programs showing the
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:29.000]  energy trading there was no energy trading Enron was just ripping everyone
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.440]  off as a mafia organization and they wrote the current tax plan the carbon
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:39.520]  tax plan with Al Gore in 95 and 96 along with BP and Goldman Sachs stay there
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:45.120]  I'm gonna have you finish up Steve in California than Michael Kobe Robert Pat
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:52.240]  and others but absolutely this is just all a mafia scam we're on the March the

[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:07.160]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double

[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:15.400]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:19.280]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:23.360]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:27.720]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:32.000]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.720]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:04.160]  thousands of times that they're taking control to shut off resources to end

[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:13.120]  they're really doing it where everything you do is government controlled and then
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:17.600]  only select global corporations are allowed to even operate so it is
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:26.720]  slavery by every yardstick but finishing up your point we right here in the Bay
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:31.480]  and they receive half a billion dollars in grants from BP to research biofuels
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:35.240]  and alternate energy but then BP whatever they produce they own those
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:39.080]  patents and they get to they get to direct which research is actually
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:43.160]  published yeah that is the first part of what you had to say we had you faded down
[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:47.720]  start over again what I'm saying is that speaking of brainwashing in the
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:51.920]  schools right here in the Bay area you have UC Berkeley which receives about
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:57.520]  half a billion in grants from from BP and they own all the patents whatever
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:00.440]  whatever these young you know researchers produce they get to they get
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:04.120]  that cherry pick what good data and what bad data they get to even publish
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:07.400]  there's not going to be any real solutions the infrastructure for an
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:11.720]  alternate energy future isn't even in place by having this memoratorium on
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:16.400]  drilling in the Gulf they're just exacerbating the situation in in addition
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:20.240]  to the ongoing conflict in the Gulf with the straight of formats closed down all
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:24.160]  this oil shipped in from the Persian Gulf is going to be tied up in a you know
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:31.000]  an indefinite war I hear you and I appreciate your call I really do in
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.600]  fact let me just digress for a moment and cover this now look British
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:40.360]  petroleum if you go out and do a search for carbon taxes global government you
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:48.000]  will see more videos than I can watch more TV ads and radio ads than I can
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.920]  even listen to or watch I mean I've never had time to sit there and watch
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:55.480]  them all world government this world government that carbon taxes this
[01:35:55.480 --> 01:36:01.400]  carbon taxes that they're funding high schools colleges when I say tens of
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:07.440]  billions funding the brainwashing to go on the new carbon tax economy run by
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:12.400]  BP I mean we've always talked about BP being the kingpin and then now you
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:18.000]  notice the kingpin of pushing this and they themselves controlled by Goldman
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.640]  Sachs who are some of the biggest funders of the carbon tax worldwide and to
[01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:26.200]  sell the derivatives it is a form of new serfdom where everything is tracked
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:29.840]  everything is traced and where they incrementally cut off our resources and
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:38.360]  energy it is siege it is military financial attack and in this controlled
[01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:45.320]  economy they are able to then only allow their businesses and their
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:52.600]  subsidiaries to make profits and then create global artificial monopolies this
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:37:00.880]  is world domination it's a perfect example and it's been reported on a
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:05.400]  year ago by the Wall Street Journal and so I want to go over some of this news
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:09.440]  today even though President Obama is against offshore drilling for our
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:14.560]  country he signed an executive order to loan two billion of our taxpayer dollars
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:19.160]  to a Brazilian oil company which is the eighth largest company in the entire
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:24.680]  world to drill for oil off the coast of Brazil the oil that comes from the
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:30.760]  operation is for the sole purpose and use of China and not for the USA now
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:35.080]  here's the real clincher the Chinese government is under contract to purchase
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:39.160]  all the oil that this oil field will produce which is hundreds of millions
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:43.240]  of barrels of oil we have absolutely no gain from this transaction whatsoever
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:47.480]  but waiting it's worse guess who is the largest individual stakeholder in this
[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:52.160]  Brazilian oil company and who would benefit from this the most we've talked
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:54.560]  about this last year when it came on the Wall Street Journal but here it is
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:59.760]  again it is the American billionaire George Soros whose former employee is
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:03.800]  the head of Obama's transition team who was one of President Obama's most
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:07.840]  generous financial supporters during his campaign if you were able to connect the
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:13.480]  dots and follow the money you are probably as upset as other Americans
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:17.480]  are about this not a word of this transaction has been broadcast on any
[01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:26.120]  part of any of the major news networks and this article continues the above
[01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:31.000]  quoted article reference and segment attributed to Fox News channel host
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:36.120]  Glenn Beck criticizing President Obama for signing an executive order to lend two
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:40.680]  billion to the Brazilian oil company to finance offshore drilling that's right
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:44.040]  part of the stimulus money I see a good job to Beck he's actually really
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:49.200]  reporting on something here all without securing reciprocal oil exports from
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:54.200]  Brazil or any other benefit of the US nearly all of the substantive claims
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:57.080]  made in the article
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:10.000]  and it just goes on and on and on my friends
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:16.880]  look at Iraq who's getting the main contracts for oil China who got the
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:23.920]  Panama Canal China who gets to have almost no tariffs but they have giant
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:30.480]  tariffs on our products China why did our government pass tax incentives in the
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:35.560]  last 20 years to pay American companies to move to China now look at where we
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:42.560]  are totally bankrupt 20 plus percent of the public can't get a job our society
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:49.800]  is falling apart the Chinese the Russians are all over the Gulf drilling
[01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:54.760]  order they want and Obama comes and tells any companies with US subsidiaries
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:59.200]  that they can't drill in the Gulf since when can Obama tell somebody if they
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:03.680]  can drill 100 miles or 200 miles or 40 miles off the coast our waters only go
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:06.480]  out 12 miles
[01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:15.480]  their whole carbon tax was dead in the water pun intended and so they went and
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:20.320]  just blew that sucker they gave orders to Anadarko and to BP that they knew
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:25.320]  would cause the well to spill to come in early before they were prepared and
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:29.840]  then they're gonna let that sucker gush forever and ever until they get their
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:33.360]  carbon taxes you know something must be done the media says something must be
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:39.720]  done we know the answer put some taxes on the American people that'll fix it
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:48.280]  all right let's go ahead and go to Michael in Texas you're on the air
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:54.840]  welcome hello Alex Jones I just wanted to thank you for your courage and I just
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:58.800]  and I've seen the zeitgeist I've seen Aaron Russo's America freedom the
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:05.440]  fascism and I've seen that up I've seen that DVD of the of the Empire has this
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:12.480]  elitist eugenics plan and my friend Matt David and myself we thought of an idea
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:17.880]  on how we could really screw over the banking aristocrats the you know the
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:21.200]  the big corporations the big government and all the other scumbags from Dr.
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:26.080]  Coiland and we just want to know if there's any any we live in Austin too
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:31.040]  and we were wondering if there's any place where we can meet you because we
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:35.760]  want to know what's your opinion on our idea and if you could help us well
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:40.080]  Michael I barely have time to see my family when I get off air every day I
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:46.160]  have stacks of work to do and so unfortunately you know I can't people
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:49.520]  every day are you saying have a strategy meeting come here meet with us talk
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:54.240]  to us you know you're talking to me right now here on the radio and
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:58.240]  unfortunately people always get crestfallen or scorned when I can't
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:02.400]  meet with them I just don't have the time but if I was you I would implement
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:06.720]  your ideas and if they don't succeed it doesn't matter at least you've put up a
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:12.320]  resistance and resistance is victory the biggest thing is educating the public
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:16.640]  about the real political paradigm exposing the offshore piratical corporate
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:20.400]  elite for what they are how they use big government to shut down their
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:24.760]  competition how republicans lie and say corporations are wonderful the
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:28.400]  democrats lie and say government is wonderful when the truth is both
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:35.040]  institutions are big and corrupt and team up to abuse the individual but and
[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:38.920]  also Michael there's not a silver bullet to this there's not one plan from
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:42.960]  what I've seen it'll bring these people down we have to first change ourselves
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:46.480]  you know it's an inside job we have to change ourselves and become better
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:51.000]  people and more educated and more informed about the world and we have to
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:54.480]  decide what our priorities are and then the most important thing is wake other
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:43:01.280]  people up wake individuals up pay it forward somebody Michael woke you up
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:06.440]  now it's up to you to wake someone else up and you don't have to teach them
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:10.240]  everything you've learned over the last few years you've just simply got to let
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:14.280]  them understand there's a bigger agenda afoot and to start questioning things
[01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:19.080]  Michael but God bless you I appreciate your call let's go ahead and talk to
[01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:26.280]  Kobe and Utah you're on the air hey also you don't I'm all right sir good and I
[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:34.440]  just had a few comments for you yeah mm-hmm um the first one has to do with
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:39.760]  you say that we need to be angry which I agree with but I also think you need to
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:44.760]  be focused seems like a lot of people I'm not focused on what we need to do
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:49.320]  mainly ending the Federal Reserve seems like we get sidetracked a lot of the
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:56.640]  time on 9-11 and things like that well some people are gonna wake up by seeing
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:00.240]  a Fox News clip where the Marine Corps commander admits they're helping grow
[01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:04.040]  the opium some people are gonna get woken up by McChrystal admitting that
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:07.760]  Obama is basically an empty suit he reads off a teleprompter some people are
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:11.560]  gonna get woken up by researching Operation Ajax Gulf of Tonkin or 9-11
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:15.600]  some people are gonna get woken up by seeing the army shooting women and
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:19.000]  children from a helicopter and then laughing about it some people are gonna
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.080]  be woken up by learning about the private Federal Reserve we probably spend
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:26.200]  an hour or two a week talking about the Federal Reserve I mean we can't just
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:31.360]  talk about one subject I have Ron Paul on every month I lobby to audit the Fed
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:36.160]  and you know you called in you're talking about it but I think this is a
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:40.800]  wide-spectrum fight and I think one big thing people say you know other people
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:44.240]  are gonna disagree with you about what they think is most important I tend to
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:48.040]  agree with you that you know auditing the Fed exposing the banking structure
[01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:52.080]  but even if we don't get an audit right away of them exposing them as the real
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:55.920]  government and as the illegitimate government in there that's really pulling
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:45:00.880]  the strings calling the shots that's what I just said to the last caller but I
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:05.240]  think more and more people say well you need to do this you do that well how
[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:09.560]  about you guys do it I mean nothing can so many people are looking for a one
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:14.880]  size fits all one action and the New World Order you know falls because the
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:19.280]  mighty Hercules goes and fights the Hydra there is no Hercules folks there's
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:24.440]  the Hercules spirit though I mean if you individually want to go out there and
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:29.800]  face down dragons every day that is on the city bus telling everybody about
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:34.000]  sodium fluoride being deadly poison but I mean go ahead you're on the year talk
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:38.360]  about the Federal Reserve right now well I just think that we need to be a
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:43.720]  little bit more like Ron Paul he doesn't mention 9-11 at all he doesn't say it
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:48.200]  wasn't inside job or it wasn't he just focuses on the ending the Federal Reserve
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:53.480]  which I think we need to do and another thing I had a comment on is a if you
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:57.560]  have serious or XM radio listeners or even if you think about getting it or
[01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:02.080]  if you're not thinking about getting it call seriously XM up tell them that if
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:06.680]  they get Alex Jones on the air every day live a full show that you will
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:12.920]  subscribe that is a good idea you know I've never really lobbied XM but that
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:16.280]  they're carrying one hour of the daytime show at night and three hours on
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:22.520]  Saturday and they're looking so to trying to carry us live the problem is
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:25.480]  you know they get filled up with other shows and they don't want to bump other
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:31.920]  people that are in those positions but good point I appreciate your call look
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:39.960]  I'm here to discredit this government this is not my government it is
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:45.840]  illegitimate it violates the Bill of Rights and Constitution religiously it
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:51.600]  is there trying to create criminal illegal treacherous treasonous
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:59.200]  precedence to fully dismantle our checks and balances and our freedoms and so I
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:02.520]  you know what I mean if the evidence shows 9-11 was an inside job I'm gonna
[01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:08.360]  talk about it it's an attitude of telling the truth I'm not trying to win a
[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:15.200]  popularity contest in a day okay I want people a decade from now to know that
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:19.040]  what I said was the truth so that they can then recognize the evil that they
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:26.560]  face in their time in their day I've always understood the basics of history
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:32.640]  and people heard me on air 15 years ago and they laughed at me and you know what
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:36.600]  they're listeners today I can't tell you how many station managers or owners or
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:41.440]  station groups call up affiliate relations at Genesis or call me and say
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:45.720]  I'm gonna pick your radio show up I thought you were a lunatic five years
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:49.320]  ago when I heard you as a guest on our station on the show and everything you
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:54.640]  said in that interview came true or it's all coming true I was on man Cal Muller
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:59.240]  big syndicated show this morning and he apologized and said I guess they are
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:03.880]  gonna put black boxes into take control of the web and you know I guess they are
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:08.960]  putting I mean he was there having to admit I was right about all these things
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:18.920]  look 95% of what we cover is right out of a government document okay and so I
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:23.760]  realize that if I'm willing to be called a kook and a nut and a dangerous
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:29.640]  lunatic by the mainstream controlled media but that's my job I mean I'm
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:34.040]  going to get the information out to warn people and I don't care if I get hurt
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:38.760]  in the process my job is to tell the truth and it's my job to take the
[01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:42.000]  bullets it's my job to take the political bullets to hit the political
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:46.400]  barbed wire so people can climb over my back folks I'm a shock troop I'm trying
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:49.720]  to beat the New World Order I'm trying to really defend humanity and have
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:56.360]  liberty and to truly unleash the power of human destiny and so I don't care if
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:00.100]  Chris Matthews has the Southern Poverty Law Center on to say you know that Alex
[01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:06.640]  Jones is gonna cause people to go out and commit murders it's not true but it's
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:11.320]  a testament to the fact that my message is dangerous to the system that they're
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:18.280]  doing things like that Robert Montana you're on the air Alex I want to talk
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:22.280]  about I'm in Billings, Montana I want to talk about the tornado that hit the
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:27.960]  Metrosport they use that as a pretext to lock down the city well that doesn't
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:32.560]  that wouldn't surprise me but this is my take on it that was done by the federal
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:37.920]  government through harp and it's I'm about a three mile straight line from
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:44.080]  the Metra and what's interesting to me is that hit practically only the Metra
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:49.200]  it was a surgical strike because the federal government has been trying to
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:53.240]  get into the back door of Montana through several different avenues for
[01:49:53.240 --> 01:50:00.720]  quite a long time and in now Schweitzer our governor has it's in the news now
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:04.240]  that he's going to request federal funds well of course that's right Montana's
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:09.120]  been kicking the feds out and then you get hit by this mega tornado and for
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:13.080]  those that just joined us it is declassified it is on record that by
[01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:21.040]  67 they could create hurricanes tornadoes typhoons in the Pacific and that
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:24.160]  they could steer them control them weaken them make them stronger
[01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:29.400]  Stanford Research Institute Naval Weapons Laboratory it is AP Reuters I
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:32.720]  interviewed the father of weather weapons Ben Livingston it's on pros and
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:39.880]  planet dot TV and yes you see the big eugenicist White House press secretary
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:45.640]  as also you talked about weather weapons but you see the White House
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:51.600]  science are John P. Holdren talking about geoengineering the planet these
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:54.880]  global warming freaks aren't just gonna blow oil wells to get what they want
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:51:02.600]  they've got weather weapons you worry but only because you're paying
[01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:06.200]  attention what's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:10.680]  nature a similar audacity called GMO or genetically modified organisms means
[01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:14.280]  that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health
[01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:18.080]  in the balance now that summers here what better time to learn about the bounty
[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:22.960]  that nature provides in wild edible food let author Linda Runyon show you the
[01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:27.040]  best kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look this summer

[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:32.840]  years that's why we're there and McCrystal didn't like it and wanted
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:35.960]  more trips to actually win the war and that's not gonna happen it's like
[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:40.720]  Vietnam also coming up the next hour I kept getting reports of this in the
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:46.000]  last week and now I've seen some local newscast I've seen YouTube videos of the
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:52.760]  rain falling down and you can see the oil all the oil sheen even in central
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:59.040]  Texas in Louisiana and Mississippi so we're gonna be going over some of that
[01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:05.080]  the articles up on info wars.com by Kurt Nemo toxic rain falls in Louisiana
[01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:10.200]  that's just some of the news coming up when we start the next hour but going
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:15.480]  back to Robert Montana yes I am really concerned in my new film coming out in
[01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:19.720]  the fall is about not just chemtrails but weather weapons eugenics there's no
[01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:23.080]  doubt the government admits they have weather weapons and you've got to look
[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:28.680]  at some of this freak weather that strikes sometimes as a weapon to bring
[01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:31.840]  federal control in plus if you understand big central banks control the
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:37.080]  US and all they want is bankrupt states so they control them then it it's
[01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:42.200]  something that has to be looked at go ahead yeah and I agree with you a hundred
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:49.400]  percent I had I was it back in 96 I was traveling on 990 here by south toward
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:55.280]  the Wyoming border and it I remember I was in four-wheel drive doing about 40
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:58.720]  miles now because the highway was so bad I'm surprised because out here they
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:02.040]  will shut the highways off they'll put a gate across if it's bad enough and you
[01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:05.760]  don't go anywhere and I think I was right at that point I didn't see another
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:10.960]  car for 20 30 minutes at a time either way and this was a 96 I didn't know
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:17.880]  anything about chemtrails now since you brought this up and I saw out my wind
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:21.360]  shield this is the afternoon it was a sort of a white overcast because it was
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:27.440]  very cold a lot of ice a lot of snow and I saw what looked to me like the air
[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:32.920]  itself being electrified never had seen anything like that in my life and I'm
[01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:40.000]  driving along in my truck and and this stuff is is is everywhere and you could
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.320]  see it in the air it looked like electricity like particles of
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:48.160]  electricity if if one could see particles of what they do is you'll have
[01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:52.480]  planes right next to planes I saw this last weekend where one jet hasn't had it
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:55.280]  mixed with the fuel we don't have the federal patent and that the Pentagon is
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:59.440]  doing it that way the airlines don't even know and it disperses the aluminum
[01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:04.040]  dioxide barium salts to create the nuclei for particulates and then you'll
[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:08.080]  just see in a space of an hour the entire sky filled with trails and they
[01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:14.480]  turn into mist and then you'll see almost the yellow chemical oily mirage in
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:19.040]  there and then I've talked to some engineers locally who say that the
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:22.320]  government covertly at some of their local weather stations that they're
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:26.480]  actually ionizing the atmosphere and then I had the head of harp on that was
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:30.880]  so bizarre what was it three four years ago that the Air Force contacts me and
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:33.800]  says you've said a lot about harp how would you like to have the director of
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:37.400]  harp on and sure enough he came on and then admitted they're even able to
[01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:41.400]  ignite the atmosphere but said that it's all friendly and no big deal then you
[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:45.920]  have secretary defense Cohen back at 97 telling army times at a press conference
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:52.120]  but the army times reported on it it was April 28th 1997 that yes they have
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:57.360]  weather weapons and tectonic weapons and race specific weapons and then we have
[01:57:57.360 --> 01:58:01.400]  Dick Cheney in the September 20th 2000 rebuilding America's defenses project
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:04.960]  for American Century document talks about legitimizing the use of race
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:08.880]  specific bio weapons so I appreciate your call I mean the point is we're in a
[01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:15.240]  Buck Rogers future much of its suppressed and classified and we're not in
[01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:17.960]  Kansas anymore ladies and gentlemen you're living in a science fiction movie
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:22.960]  you need to understand that and they've got vaccines that reprogram your brain
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:28.360]  they admit they've got I mean it's just the skies the limit folks even if we
[01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:32.920]  were fully conscious of this and fought back every way we could it's a serious
[01:58:32.920 --> 01:58:36.320]  battle we're facing but if people are busy sucking their thumbs only caring
[01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:42.960]  about the World Cup we don't have a prayer we'll be right back thank you

[01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:26.840]  world government I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a
[01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:30.560]  world constitution for the global financial system global governance with
[01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:34.800]  the establishment of a G20 so it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then

[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:45.360]  little short time with a few calls and then a news blitz for at least two
[02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:51.000]  segments coming up and then we'll continue with calls until Dr. John
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:54.960]  Coleman joins us in the last hour author researcher to give us his take on the
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:01:00.560]  Iran situation the oil spill McChrystal all of it and he also of course was the
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:07.320]  MI6 so that's coming up in the last hour and we'll open phones then as well but
[02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:12.920]  Pat, Joanne, Craig, and we're gonna get to all of you here in the next few
[02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:19.280]  segments let's go ahead and talk to let's talk to Craig first to WIFL more
[02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:21.800]  and more I'm gonna start trying to get listeners to tell us how they're
[02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:25.480]  listening you know in the past I would do that whether it was AM FM shortwave
[02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:28.480]  internet satellite over the years we just quit asking you know people are
[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:32.560]  calling in so but if you like to tell us how you're listening that's always good
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:39.960]  we want to plug all these great affiliates WIFL 100.4.2 I think they
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:46.480]  have.2 so they have odd numbers but whatever 100.4 there in Florida Craig
[02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:53.440]  good to have you on with us. Hi Alex, it's 104.3 listen first of all I want to
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:57.520]  talk about McChrystal I heard Michael Savage last night say he used to work
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:02.640]  for the CFR which I find troubling what's your what's on that one well
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:06.440]  everybody hates Obama which is good I mean they built him up as God he's not
[02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:13.240]  God he's a basically a cocaine head from Indonesia but it's important to tear
[02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:17.600]  down that image because the globalist could use him as a messianic leader and
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:21.320]  they tried it it failed so everybody wants to look at McChrystal is good
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:25.160]  because he did want more troops to actually win the war the war is being
[02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:30.720]  won people always want to win the drug war as there's triple the heroin double
[02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:35.160]  the cocaine flooding in now than what there was 20 years ago there's more
[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:38.600]  people in prison the drug war is a great success the government shipping most of
[02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:42.800]  it in laundering the money through private banks and so McChrystal has been
[02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:48.720]  in control and is so bold he gave the orders to admit that we are guarding
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:53.960]  poppies and helping grow it and McChrystal from my research is a
[02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:59.760]  globalist and it also seen him trying to integrate women into frontline roles
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:03.360]  which is just it's a joke folks okay I mean women aren't supposed to be in
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:08.280]  frontline combat nobody does it it doesn't work it's it's it's men act
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:11.600]  differently when they see a woman's head blown off they do another man it's just
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:15.240]  in the way things are done and so I particularly from looking at him don't
[02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:19.400]  like McChrystal you know I know Savage because I happened to tune in last night
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:23.240]  driving home was calling him a great Spartan and you know an incredible guy
[02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:27.000]  and Obama's uncomfortable around him well I'm sure Obama is uncomfortable around
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:31.280]  him I mean I'm sure McChrystal is better than Obama and I didn't and I mean
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:35.080]  anybody that's that high level as a general is going to have a problem
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:40.200]  Fox Fallon you know the head of Centcom refused to attack Iran and that came out
[02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:44.040]  I mean he was a good guy from what we saw they've had some other people step
[02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:50.960]  down and I don't really want to judging because I don't know enough about him so
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:56.160]  I mean I don't know what do you think I'm a crystal I think this is all like I
[02:03:56.160 --> 02:04:00.720]  want to use your word stage I think this is all planned on his part and follow me
[02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:06.120]  on this I think he did this little thing in Rolling Stone on purpose to get
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:11.120]  himself fired by the Democrat this way it kind of looks like the bad cop
[02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:17.760]  good cop routine where look at that Obama fired a general and I think I think
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:22.320]  McChrystal's plan is to run for president and then because think about the
[02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:25.800]  Republicans don't have nobody they keep talking about Gingrich he'll never get
[02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:29.440]  elected they're gonna keep talking about Romney he's he's portray us isn't gonna
[02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:34.600]  get elected after that seizure we know they've been talking about a Mitt Romney
[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:38.680]  portrays ticket go ahead okay well that's just my thought maybe I think it
[02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:42.920]  was might have been done on purpose just big sir I totally agree with you there
[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:47.880]  is no doubt this was done on purpose I mean but crystal isn't an idiot he I
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:52.600]  mean he told Rolling Stone magazine all of this and who full well it was gonna
[02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:56.560]  be published so I agree with you this is staged and he wanted out of the
[02:04:56.560 --> 02:05:01.600]  military and probably to run for president good great point hello this is

[02:06:14.520 --> 02:06:17.560]  wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our land
[02:06:17.560 --> 02:06:23.120]  they think they're on our water children our education our money we have to define

[02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:15.400]  okay we're now eight minutes into this third hour your phone calls are coming
[02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:24.080]  up at 1-800-259-9231 on this live Wednesday June 23rd 2010 edition let's go
[02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:32.240]  over some of the most important headlines of the day well the government's
[02:08:32.240 --> 02:08:37.760]  pleading with president to allow work to continue WDSU television the federal
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:41.520]  government is shutting down the dredging that was being done to create
[02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:46.040]  protective sand berms in the Gulf of Mexico the berms are meant to protect
[02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:51.200]  the Louisiana coastline from oil but the US Fish and Wildlife Department has
[02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:56.640]  concerns about where the dredging is being done and so leaders of different
[02:08:56.640 --> 02:09:00.680]  parishes and others are pleading with the federal government to stop blocking
[02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:04.880]  them once again our government resource agencies which were intended to protect
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:08.680]  us are now leaving us vulnerable to destruction of our coastline and
[02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:13.200]  marshes by the impending oil because the government is all about following the
[02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:18.560]  orders of those above you so that the globalist can control society how does
[02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:23.640]  this dovetail with the airline story I saw an article about a flight from
[02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:30.960]  Europe to New Jersey to Newark on the 16 hour flight it was over a hundred
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:36.680]  degrees for much of the flight and people were panicking and I always hear
[02:09:36.680 --> 02:09:40.640]  about these articles about how they're under international and national
[02:09:40.640 --> 02:09:44.680]  regulations where a plane will be on the tarmac for four five six sometimes 24
[02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:49.760]  hours and they can't open the door to let the the hot air out or to let new
[02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:56.280]  oxygen in because of a TSA regulation I mean we are crippled by regulations and
[02:09:56.280 --> 02:09:59.600]  you go to China there are almost no regulations so all the industry goes
[02:09:59.600 --> 02:10:05.960]  there and this is all done by design but every day we see articles where they
[02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:09.880]  can't put dredge boats out there because the feds say no and the Coast Guard says
[02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:14.320]  no or where they can't block the estuary so the oil doesn't come in and most the
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:18.600]  oil according to the NASA photographs is still out in the Gulf and going towards
[02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:22.560]  Florida most of it hasn't hit yet and so there's still time to block these
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:27.720]  estuaries and rivers and lakes that this oil is going to back up in and get
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:31.320]  into but the federal government's doing everything they can right now to stop
[02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:36.400]  that because the bigger the crisis the more power and control these people are
[02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:47.200]  going to get it's just so sad to see this to see all of this just intensifying
[02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:51.960]  let's get into some economic news here this is out of the Associated Press now
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:55.360]  remember they've been telling you for three years that the recession is going
[02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:59.440]  to go away and that the prosperity is right around the corner or that we've
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:05.400]  reached prosperity the real unemployment's above 22 percent inflation's
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:10.040]  higher than what they say anybody who is out in the free market and not working
[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:14.880]  for government where government jobs are up pays up for government that is if
[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:23.440]  it's federal government new home sales plunge 33% with tax credits gone new
[02:11:23.440 --> 02:11:26.600]  home sales dropped the lowest level on record in May at the federal home buyer
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:32.200]  tax credit ends and I've got another story here with a Democratic Congress has
[02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:37.160]  now made the decision to cut the middle-class tax cuts that Obama promised
[02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:41.640]  and next you'll hear they're actually going to be tax increases but the tax
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:45.240]  increases on the middle class and the wealthy will just be a tax increase on
[02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:49.000]  the working class because people will just lay off more employees or cut
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:54.600]  their cut their pay but new home sales plunge cells of new homes collapsed in
[02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:58.600]  May sinking 33% of the lowest level on record as potential buyers stopped
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:06.400]  shopping for homes once they could no longer receive government tax credits
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:12.360]  continuing J.P. Morgan set sites overseas New York Times J.P. Morgan Chase
[02:12:12.360 --> 02:12:18.040]  emerged from the financial crisis as one of the strongest banks on American soil
[02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:26.200]  now it wants to make up lost ground overseas the bank chief executive at
[02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:29.680]  Jamie Diamond announced a series of management changes towards the end on
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:34.480]  Tuesday so they've sucked America Drive the locust are moving on to other
[02:12:34.480 --> 02:12:43.880]  other fields but yeah oh yeah the big central banks the big insiders they're
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:49.040]  all making record profits right now they're doing quite well but the rest
[02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:52.760]  the economy is in freefall I mentioned this yesterday but I thought I'd
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:58.040]  actually get into the headline today Lord Rothschild fund joins World Gold
[02:12:58.040 --> 02:13:06.840]  Council to put 12.5 million pounds of gold bullion into vault or 12.5 million
[02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:11.080]  worth of the article should say it it could that could be misinterpreted as
[02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:18.200]  12.5 million physical pounds but and it goes on it goes on from there so the
[02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:22.200]  elites I saw another article two days ago where the Saudi Royal House is
[02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:27.840]  doubled its gold holdings that's one reason gold continues to go up and up
[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:33.760]  and up here's one out of the LA Times of course the LA Times had a story a
[02:13:33.760 --> 02:13:38.320]  month ago about the state government is announcing along with the city government
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:42.920]  of LA that they're no longer going to pave many roads or streets or fixed
[02:13:42.920 --> 02:13:49.400]  sidewalks all money must go to interest on the debt to the bankers all money it
[02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:55.120]  says may would to lay off all city employees this mantle police department
[02:13:55.120 --> 02:14:00.560]  so record taxes record regulations and less government that actually provides
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:05.960]  a service just this is what they I mean in Nigeria they pay almost all their
[02:14:05.960 --> 02:14:11.240]  taxes to the Armageddon World Bank nothing to the people it's the same thing
[02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:16.720]  in Costa Rica or Argentina or places where these bankers run things continuing
[02:14:16.720 --> 02:14:20.920]  here of course Costa Rica hasn't been fully imploded yet but they're going to
[02:14:20.920 --> 02:14:25.320]  get around to it don't worry I mentioned this yesterday it was all over the
[02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:29.880]  Australian news that yes the government will make you install software that
[02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:35.560]  sensors what you can view but also tracks what you're doing with messages back
[02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:40.440]  on the software down line back to the government servers and of course here
[02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:44.360]  the FCC announced last week and it was in the Financial Times of London NAP that
[02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:50.240]  we'll have a black box with software in our house that tracks everything we do
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:57.800]  but not only will it track everything that we do it will also restrict what we
[02:14:57.800 --> 02:15:02.080]  can see so it's interesting to see the government telling the truth about what
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:06.680]  they're doing brazenly but to see the media spinning it and here's an article
[02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:13.080]  out of the news of Australia where they spin it no antivirus software no
[02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:17.800]  internet connection and they tell you oh it's this special government approved
[02:15:17.800 --> 02:15:22.400]  software and and more and more even outside of government control it's
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:25.760]  these government software systems and government approved software systems
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:29.700]  that restrict where you can go on the web what you can visit and they're
[02:15:29.700 --> 02:15:34.760]  reporting back a lot of the software will ask oh your yahoo messenger failed
[02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:38.800]  or oh your antivirus failed would you like to report back what you know to the
[02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:43.600]  virus company and people just click yes and it sends all your information but
[02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:49.600]  now under this no here in the US Australia Europe places like Italy it
[02:15:49.600 --> 02:15:54.000]  doesn't matter they're just going to do it Australians would be forced to install
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:58.200]  antivirus and firewall software on their computers and of course then that's
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:01.240]  government-designed before being allowed to connect to the internet under a new
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:05.440]  plan to fight cybercrime now of course separately the government admits this is
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:09.560]  quote stronger than Chinese style net censorship and if their computer did
[02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:14.360]  get infected internet service providers like Telstra and Optus would cut off
[02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:20.840]  their connection until the problem was resolved so see now these big ISPs under
[02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:25.720]  government control they're in your computer watching what's going on what
[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:28.880]  did John McCain say four years ago he wanted if you quote downloaded
[02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:32.920]  questionable material they would quote kill your computer remotely that's where
[02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:36.520]  this is going where your computer is nothing but a terminal tied into
[02:16:36.520 --> 02:16:40.080]  government where your cell phone is a terminal tied into government that's
[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:44.200]  cyber security and the same systems being implemented worldwide then they're
[02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:48.920]  going to use all these firewalls and sluggish things they're adding to bankrupt
[02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:53.080]  and screw up the old web and force you on to internet to where you publicly
[02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:56.440]  register and go through their systems that it's going to be super high speed
[02:16:56.440 --> 02:17:00.120]  connection and they won't ask you when they come out to install your new cable

[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:24.560]  long inquiry into cybercrime by the House representatives standing committee
[02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:28.120]  on communications notice England the same week made the announcement said the
[02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:32.760]  same thing in the same week the US government announces we found porn and

[02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:51.320]  able to do this if we're in a war and they're hearing up for the Iran attack
[02:17:51.320 --> 02:17:54.840]  right now I mean do you see what they're doing ladies and gentlemen how bold

[02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:04.440]  market hacker into an organized transnational crime committed for

[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:22.840]  attack use it as the pretext to take over the web because the web is killing
[02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:29.320]  the mainstream media because it's offered real diversity real news and
[02:18:29.320 --> 02:18:33.880]  information and real choice you've got the mainstream media cheerleading and
[02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:37.880]  begging for the government to take over the web and you've got the FCC saying
[02:18:37.880 --> 02:18:42.840]  the fees and fines from these boxes will be paid to quote support government
[02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:48.440]  messages in traditional respected trusted that's in quotes mainstream media

[02:24:56.200 --> 02:25:01.080]  this country was founded on and it's just so incredible
[02:25:01.080 --> 02:25:06.520]  to see them openly teaching collectivism
[02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:11.880]  collectivism is bondage collectivism isn't being able to choose
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:16.600]  who you want to associate with what you want to try to be in life

[02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:25.720]  stand up for it's just so amazing i'm going to continue with the news
[02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:30.120]  after the break with mccrystal and what's happened when i ran
[02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:34.520]  and a lot more but first let's let's go ahead and go back to your calls i've
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:40.120]  covered news for a while uh let's go ahead and uh who's up first here john
[02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:46.520]  pat in texas you're on the air hello um i just wanted to tell you
[02:25:46.520 --> 02:25:51.800]  that i almost fell off my chair last night at the 10 o'clock news on channel
[02:25:51.800 --> 02:25:58.840]  four in dallas fox news they were talking about the dallas police department
[02:25:58.840 --> 02:26:06.760]  and he called it a paramilitary force not police no no they hide all this in
[02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:10.840]  plain view and they tell the police you're federalized you're a paramilitary
[02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:14.200]  force uh their internal training is gun owners veterans
[02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:17.800]  conservatives are their number one enemy i mean the look the police and
[02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:22.360]  military on an individual basis are not traders are not bad
[02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:25.400]  some are but but on an individual basis you can't judge them
[02:26:25.400 --> 02:26:29.720]  but the system and the orders they're given and the culture that they've been
[02:26:29.720 --> 02:26:35.560]  incrementally brought into is 180 degrees in the opposite
[02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:38.840]  direction of our republic it is treason
[02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:43.800]  yeah i just didn't expect them to do it and like you said i'm playing man i
[02:26:43.800 --> 02:26:47.640]  didn't expect that the the pentagon to admit they're growing the opium in
[02:26:47.640 --> 02:26:51.080]  afghanistan or they put out fake bin laden videos
[02:26:51.080 --> 02:26:54.120]  or that they lie and say they've killed al-qaeda leaders
[02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:57.800]  i mean it again they're really getting to the point of just
[02:26:57.800 --> 02:27:01.160]  throwing it in our face
[02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:08.920]  oh well anyway i did like i said i just couldn't believe it
[02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:11.880]  ma'am i can't believe it either god bless you and i appreciate your call i
[02:27:11.880 --> 02:27:15.240]  mean i couldn't believe it two weeks ago when i had the fort war star telegram
[02:27:15.240 --> 02:27:20.040]  with the police chief with the headline police chief promotes hormone
[02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:23.400]  replacement and then he was talking about the police
[02:27:23.400 --> 02:27:28.760]  injecting anabolic steroids and testosterone and how great it is
[02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:32.760]  i mean again i'm not the toughest guy in the world but i'm red-blooded
[02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:36.760]  and i've got my normal testosterone and i've got to control myself
[02:27:36.760 --> 02:27:39.960]  i've got to think i'm a loving nice person i'm a good person
[02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:45.160]  you know i'm a sweet person uh i mean now i'm the type of person somebody
[02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:48.040]  gets in my face i immediately want to physically attack them
[02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:51.400]  that's how men have always been what i mean no wonder cops are going crazy
[02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:53.560]  beating people up and going nuts all the time
[02:27:53.560 --> 02:27:57.640]  injecting steroids it's come out some departments half of the men are on
[02:27:57.640 --> 02:28:01.240]  roids some of the women are taking it what are you
[02:28:01.240 --> 02:28:06.840]  what are you doing i mean i've read what anabolic steroids do and it
[02:28:06.840 --> 02:28:09.960]  intensifies everything that testosterone already does naturally
[02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:14.280]  delusions of grandeur excessive rage aggression
[02:28:14.280 --> 02:28:19.720]  lunacy i mean a war likeness i mean of course we've got problems they're
[02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:23.480]  hopping the cops up on steroids
[02:28:23.480 --> 02:28:31.400]  oh man i just don't understand it i mean i cannot
[02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:34.840]  imagine from what i've read taking steroids folks
[02:28:34.840 --> 02:28:39.080]  i cannot i mean i feel crazed right now i feel completely aggressive right now
[02:28:39.080 --> 02:28:42.200]  i mean i feel like i could go out and get in a fight with
[02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:46.280]  i could take on 10 guys right now that's how i feel every day
[02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:51.080]  and the more i exercise the worse it gets you know uh that's why
[02:28:51.080 --> 02:28:55.880]  when i diet and don't don't lift see i've been dieting i've lost a lot of weight
[02:28:55.880 --> 02:28:58.600]  i've been lifting i've been running i've been swimming and i'm just i'm just
[02:28:58.600 --> 02:29:03.080]  getting wild that's because i'm boosting my regular testosterone
[02:29:03.080 --> 02:29:07.160]  so you got a bunch of paramilitary people hopped up on drugs running around
[02:29:07.160 --> 02:29:10.040]  who've been taught the american people of their enemy
[02:29:10.040 --> 02:29:14.120]  we've got this clip let's go ahead and play it as we go out to break
[02:29:14.120 --> 02:29:18.520]  here is the clip of obama
[02:29:18.520 --> 02:29:24.200]  includes adherence to a strict code of conduct
[02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:27.640]  the strength and greatness of our military is rooted in the fact that
[02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:31.800]  this code applies equally to newly enlisted privates
[02:29:31.800 --> 02:29:36.520]  and to the general officer who commands them that allows us to come
[02:29:36.520 --> 02:29:40.200]  together as one that is part of the reason why
[02:29:40.200 --> 02:29:45.720]  america has the finest fighting force in the history of the world
[02:29:45.720 --> 02:29:49.960]  it is also true that our democracy depends upon institutions
[02:29:49.960 --> 02:29:54.920]  that are stronger than individuals the empires on the run

[02:32:03.160 --> 02:32:07.160]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:32:07.160 --> 02:32:10.920]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:32:10.920 --> 02:32:14.520]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:32:14.520 --> 02:32:18.760]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:32:18.760 --> 02:32:22.440]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[02:32:22.440 --> 02:32:26.840]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:32:26.840 --> 02:32:30.760]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:32:30.760 --> 02:32:33.880]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[02:32:33.880 --> 02:32:37.880]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[02:32:37.880 --> 02:32:41.640]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in
[02:32:41.640 --> 02:32:44.920]  the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my old

[02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:08.840]  okay i'm gonna get back into what happened with mccrystal today my take on it
[02:33:08.840 --> 02:33:12.760]  some of the bizarre things that obama had to say at his press conference an hour
[02:33:12.760 --> 02:33:18.200]  ago before i go any further i uh wanted to tell listeners
[02:33:18.200 --> 02:33:21.240]  that we have a lot of new great patriot t-shirts
[02:33:21.240 --> 02:33:24.760]  that literally turn you into a walking talking billboard for liberty
[02:33:24.760 --> 02:33:29.720]  we have one that's uh no obama care but they don't tread on me snake around the
[02:33:29.720 --> 02:33:32.840]  symbol of medicine and then we've got
[02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:35.880]  another t-shirt that i think is my favorite of the group
[02:33:35.880 --> 02:33:41.480]  it says legalized freedom and it's got an american flag with the stars and bars
[02:33:41.480 --> 02:33:45.480]  but the bars are made up by barbed wire and it's a great way to start
[02:33:45.480 --> 02:33:48.360]  conversations with people and it says legalized freedom
[02:33:48.360 --> 02:33:53.320]  on the back and your purchase of these t-shirts also funds our operation here

[02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:42.200]  infowars.com okay i want to get into the iran
[02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:45.800]  situation and i've got mainstream news articles
[02:35:45.800 --> 02:35:51.560]  also here in my stack out of india where they're reporting that in major
[02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:55.080]  towns and cities where they've been floridating the water under imf
[02:35:55.080 --> 02:35:59.000]  world bank funding because the imf world bank cares so much about your teeth
[02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:02.040]  they come in and will spend millions even on a small town
[02:36:02.040 --> 02:36:06.040]  lobbying just to get you to drink that because the big central bankers
[02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:09.160]  they want your pension funds and they want your land
[02:36:09.160 --> 02:36:11.960]  and they always fund eugenics organizations and openly say there's too
[02:36:11.960 --> 02:36:16.280]  many of us but they care about our teeth and it just so happens it
[02:36:16.280 --> 02:36:19.960]  sterilizes reduces fertility and is causing massive bone cancer and
[02:36:19.960 --> 02:36:24.760]  deformities and they end in governments even admitting this now so
[02:36:24.760 --> 02:36:27.880]  i saw another group of vpa scientists coming out and saying it should be taken
[02:36:27.880 --> 02:36:30.920]  out of the water uh so those are some other articles
[02:36:30.920 --> 02:36:33.960]  that i have but again there's no government conspiracy sure it
[02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:37.400]  sterilizes sure it causes bone cancer but they're not doing it because they
[02:36:37.400 --> 02:36:40.200]  want to hurt you no no no they're doing it because they
[02:36:40.200 --> 02:36:43.640]  want to take good care of you but but getting serious
[02:36:43.640 --> 02:36:47.000]  here is obama one of the little jewels from his speech
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:51.480]  about how our institutions are what make american democracy great
[02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:58.920]  not our individuals here is the clip that is 180 degrees the opposite of what
[02:36:58.920 --> 02:37:03.560]  our republic was founded on there as one
[02:37:03.560 --> 02:37:07.320]  that is part of the reason why america has the finest fighting force
[02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:13.640]  in the history of the world it is also true that our democracy depends upon
[02:37:13.640 --> 02:37:17.960]  institutions that are stronger than individuals
[02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:21.160]  that includes strict adherence to the military chain of command
[02:37:21.160 --> 02:37:25.240]  in respect for civilian control over that chain of command
[02:37:25.240 --> 02:37:29.480]  ah and that's why as commander-in-chief i believe this decision is necessary
[02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:34.200]  to to hold ourselves accountable to standards that are okay for of our
[02:37:34.200 --> 02:37:38.120]  democracy and so again hitler is the government in 1939
[02:37:38.120 --> 02:37:41.560]  germany and uh you must do what the furor says
[02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:44.200]  even if it violates the bill of rights and constitution
[02:37:44.200 --> 02:37:47.720]  you must follow orders well we know what happened uh nuremberg but understand
[02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:51.480]  we're not a democracy we're a constitutional republic and i know
[02:37:51.480 --> 02:37:55.880]  you the listeners of this transmission understand that
[02:37:55.880 --> 02:37:59.640]  i know that you are fully aware of that but
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:04.040]  your neighbors aren't i mean you could argue to explain to them they'll say
[02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:09.320]  well we are a democracy and go well our founders didn't call us a democratic
[02:38:09.320 --> 02:38:14.200]  republic we're a constitutional republic
[02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:18.040]  that means the people found a system to protect their liberty their freedom
[02:38:18.040 --> 02:38:21.080]  their property and their right to live their life
[02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:23.720]  as they see fit as long as they don't hurt others
[02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:27.720]  and that if 51 percent votes to make
[02:38:27.720 --> 02:38:31.960]  the other 49 work as their slaves it doesn't happen in a republic
[02:38:31.960 --> 02:38:36.840]  in a democracy it does so that's why they always say democracy democracy and
[02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:42.840]  institutions are our country he says you know
[02:38:42.840 --> 02:38:46.280]  as a democracy is able to function because institutions are bigger and
[02:38:46.280 --> 02:38:51.240]  more important than people well yeah in a democracy in a slave system
[02:38:51.240 --> 02:38:54.600]  uh that is the case but this isn't even a democracy
[02:38:54.600 --> 02:38:59.320]  the if they could get 51 percent to vote for slavery
[02:38:59.320 --> 02:39:03.400]  uh they're not going to share the booty with the 51 percent
[02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:06.680]  no in every poll even the dumb down american public
[02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:10.120]  because you know they're smart there's uninformed they're somewhat informed
[02:39:10.120 --> 02:39:14.920]  it runs the gamut you know the ugly american analogy
[02:39:14.920 --> 02:39:18.440]  has some validity but there's the ugly german the ugly chinese the ugly
[02:39:18.440 --> 02:39:22.760]  african the ugly uh you know every country has its bad people
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:25.880]  so yeah there's the ugly american there's the ugly frenchman
[02:39:25.880 --> 02:39:29.960]  but but but overall there's a whole diversity to a country
[02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:35.800]  and the public doesn't want open borders over 80 percent major polls the
[02:39:35.800 --> 02:39:40.120]  the public doesn't want uh carbon taxes over 80 percent major polls the
[02:39:40.120 --> 02:39:43.240]  public 99 percent in gallup polls didn't want the
[02:39:43.240 --> 02:39:45.960]  banker bailout but it happened so this isn't really even a
[02:39:45.960 --> 02:39:50.440]  democracy they just tell you you voted this is what you want
[02:39:50.440 --> 02:39:54.120]  but then they buy off the politicians and only
[02:39:54.120 --> 02:39:57.560]  put people forward for high office who've already got so much dirt on them
[02:39:57.560 --> 02:40:01.080]  and are so compromised they can destroy them anytime they want and to watch that
[02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:05.960]  chicago mob boss with another mob boss biden the total gangster
[02:40:05.960 --> 02:40:09.000]  he's describing people the diplomatic corps is a gangster sitting there with
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:09.800]  that
[02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:16.840]  man don calioni oh i tell you basini's a pimp it wasn't until day i knew you know
[02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:22.280]  to tell you it's a pimp it wasn't until the day i knew it was basini though
[02:40:22.280 --> 02:40:25.560]  when i die you'll be invited to a meeting and at that meeting you'll be
[02:40:25.560 --> 02:40:28.920]  assassinated now these are quotes from the godfather
[02:40:28.920 --> 02:40:34.120]  i mean to look at them going you will follow the order of put the mob bosses
[02:40:34.120 --> 02:40:37.160]  up there of these guys but they're only regional
[02:40:37.160 --> 02:40:42.520]  capos over north america they work for the big Rothschild mafia above them
[02:40:42.520 --> 02:40:45.240]  so that is just some of what we're going to be covering right now let's go to
[02:40:45.240 --> 02:40:49.000]  joanne in ohio you're on the air
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:55.080]  hi alex how are you today i am doing all right um well i had gone on uh
[02:40:55.080 --> 02:41:00.040]  your site you know because there's been growing talk of nuking this well
[02:41:00.040 --> 02:41:04.840]  and i read on your site about uh you know the methane eruptions the giant
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:08.440]  tsunamis and you know a lot of the different problems that could come
[02:41:08.440 --> 02:41:13.160]  from that but i got the look and there is a
[02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:17.800]  rather large fault line through new Orleans
[02:41:17.800 --> 02:41:22.440]  and it wise off and heads westward through texas
[02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:25.880]  and then the other portion heads up to the great lakes well that's right i'm on
[02:41:25.880 --> 02:41:30.840]  the balcony's fault line and there are scores of extinct volcanoes all
[02:41:30.840 --> 02:41:33.480]  around austin where i live and that fault line goes out
[02:41:33.480 --> 02:41:36.040]  towards louisiana and then out into the gulf
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:39.640]  and that's why the mississippi every 100 years or so
[02:41:39.640 --> 02:41:43.160]  there's a big earthquake and it changes its course it changes
[02:41:43.160 --> 02:41:47.400]  uh you know basically where uh where it's traveling from the north to the
[02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:52.120]  south in some cases up to five miles uh and we have posted
[02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:55.320]  links to reports by geologists that are concerned about if a nuke is
[02:41:55.320 --> 02:42:00.360]  detonated via slant drilling to try to stop this oil that's
[02:42:00.360 --> 02:42:04.600]  pouring out it may fracture the entire structure and may detonate the
[02:42:04.600 --> 02:42:07.160]  methane or other natural gas that's down there
[02:42:07.160 --> 02:42:10.200]  that could cause some type of chain reaction and a lot of people
[02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:13.480]  with letters behind their names say this is a potential problem
[02:42:13.480 --> 02:42:16.760]  uh which may be part of the plan i mean they may have chosen this area and are
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:20.840]  meaning to wind this up to that point i mean who knows the sky's the limit with
[02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:25.000]  these globalists they'll do anything to bring in their world government
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:29.720]  exactly um i had contacted a geologist mike hanson at the ohio
[02:42:29.720 --> 02:42:33.880]  seismic network and uh you know nukes were regularly
[02:42:33.880 --> 02:42:38.040]  tested underground but never near fault lines
[02:42:38.040 --> 02:42:41.400]  what a way to drive the american people into camp fema
[02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:45.320]  well who knows who knows but when they do drive us into camp fema i mean
[02:42:45.320 --> 02:42:48.120]  america already has more people than in prison than the other nation
[02:42:48.120 --> 02:42:51.560]  we already have our kids more brainwashed and trained to line up and be
[02:42:51.560 --> 02:42:54.600]  searched than any other country we're already in camp fema but yes
[02:42:54.600 --> 02:42:59.160]  they want to accelerate it and i think people realize now this is the time of
[02:42:59.160 --> 02:43:02.360]  intensification of oppression joe and good to hear from you
[02:43:02.360 --> 02:43:06.600]  scotty in kentucky you're on the air hello
[02:43:06.600 --> 02:43:12.280]  hello how are you i'm good okay alex what i want to touch up on here the lady
[02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:16.600]  just kindly touched up on it is the the oil coming up in the gulf
[02:43:16.600 --> 02:43:20.200]  what about all the gases that can build up under the surface because we have like
[02:43:20.200 --> 02:43:25.800]  the killer lakes in africa which ever so often the gasses turn up and they
[02:43:25.800 --> 02:43:32.360]  kill like 1700 people in 1986 i just want to touch up on that
[02:43:32.360 --> 02:43:36.520]  well there's a lot of confusion going on because it is a complex world
[02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:40.360]  uh and there's a lot of different factors they drill for natural gas they
[02:43:40.360 --> 02:43:44.920]  they drill into these deposits uh all the time
[02:43:44.920 --> 02:43:48.440]  and there are huge deposits in the gulf and when they find oil they generally
[02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:51.720]  find natural gas i would imagine they probably hit natural
[02:43:51.720 --> 02:43:54.600]  gas and oil at several other levels on their way down
[02:43:54.600 --> 02:43:57.320]  before they were going for the main zone they were after i mean that's the
[02:43:57.320 --> 02:44:01.320]  standard operating procedure from what i've researched uh people that work in
[02:44:01.320 --> 02:44:03.960]  oil fields can call and correct me if i'm wrong
[02:44:03.960 --> 02:44:08.840]  uh but uh so they've already fractured the structure it's
[02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:13.800]  already leaking up to 20 miles away the issue is detonating a nuke down there
[02:44:13.800 --> 02:44:17.720]  they believe will just fracture all of that even more and create more cracks up
[02:44:17.720 --> 02:44:21.160]  to the surface and could release even bigger
[02:44:21.160 --> 02:44:24.600]  multi-billion gallon reservoirs and if it hits
[02:44:24.600 --> 02:44:29.480]  some big reservoirs of natural gas a nuke will probably cause a chain reaction
[02:44:29.480 --> 02:44:32.920]  in the gas and will probably break the structure up even more
[02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:36.200]  and cause more leaking but don't worry obama
[02:44:36.200 --> 02:44:41.000]  and and bp will have a new carbon tax that will handle that problem for you
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:44.600]  man it just kills me to think about well they're mad they're control freaks i mean
[02:44:44.600 --> 02:44:48.040]  they didn't get their Copenhagen global treaty to pay your tax money directly
[02:44:48.040 --> 02:44:52.520]  to Goldman Sachs and jp morgan chase that that run out the imf and world bank
[02:44:52.520 --> 02:44:56.200]  and they're openly saying you're gonna pay your taxes to them and so of course
[02:44:56.200 --> 02:45:00.360]  Goldman Sachs runs bp and they'll do whatever they have to to scare you into
[02:45:00.360 --> 02:45:04.440]  going along with the carbon tax people are like well what is a tax on my house
[02:45:04.440 --> 02:45:07.720]  or on coal had to do with this and obama just says
[02:45:07.720 --> 02:45:12.280]  you're gonna find out schmuck and agree with that that's for sure
[02:45:12.280 --> 02:45:16.280]  all these people let me look they're the sky's the limit i'm sorry go ahead
[02:45:16.280 --> 02:45:19.560]  i said i agree with that it's a shame of what's going on
[02:45:19.560 --> 02:45:22.600]  and i want to let you know you got a lot of friends here in Kentucky
[02:45:22.600 --> 02:45:26.120]  i know we have a lot of great folks and look at ran paul winning
[02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:29.880]  look at this uh black republican trouncing strong thurman
[02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:33.720]  who had a lot of strong thurman jr had a lot more money
[02:45:33.720 --> 02:45:38.600]  than him uh as a republican in the primary the tea party candidate beat out
[02:45:38.600 --> 02:45:41.880]  the strong thurman son i mean it just shows
[02:45:41.880 --> 02:45:47.320]  no matter what party it is or what election now all of the establishment
[02:45:47.320 --> 02:45:50.840]  candidates are incumbents are out on their butts
[02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:54.520]  i tell you i really think ron paul is going to win cause he's got tremendous
[02:45:54.520 --> 02:45:57.640]  support here and but you wouldn't not hear it on the mainstream media
[02:45:57.640 --> 02:46:02.200]  that's a total scam of what they're doing and i've we've all seen the video
[02:46:02.200 --> 02:46:07.720]  we've played it here of he's on satellite and uh rachel madow who's got a
[02:46:07.720 --> 02:46:10.600]  couple hundred thousand viewers i mean the woman is a complete joke i mean
[02:46:10.600 --> 02:46:14.360]  they got a fancy television production that's it it just hoaxes the people
[02:46:14.360 --> 02:46:18.360]  that watch it and are thinking it's it's big it's it's a joke
[02:46:18.360 --> 02:46:23.160]  i mean you know a regional baseball game in texas on am radio
[02:46:23.160 --> 02:46:26.680]  has more listeners than that does more viewers
[02:46:26.680 --> 02:46:34.920]  uh and madow got him on was talking over him and she and he's talking and
[02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:37.160]  she's talking and she goes what do you think of the civil rights act and he's
[02:46:37.160 --> 02:46:41.720]  like okay hold on okay yes and he goes no i support that
[02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:48.280]  he goes okay uh yes i can't oh no i i support the civil
[02:46:48.280 --> 02:46:50.360]  rights act and they took him going uh huh
[02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:53.640]  yes mm-hmm because she'd been talking over him
[02:46:53.640 --> 02:46:57.560]  and then he stopped and shut up and said yes which is what anybody does yes
[02:46:57.560 --> 02:47:01.560]  yes say it again oh proof proof he goes no i'm
[02:47:01.560 --> 02:47:05.320]  i'm not against the civil rights act yes you are yes you i mean it was a hoax
[02:47:05.320 --> 02:47:09.480]  everything they do is about criminal hoaxes of deception i appreciate your
[02:47:09.480 --> 02:47:15.240]  call they just there's no end to these people
[02:47:15.240 --> 02:47:19.480]  let's talk to john in washington john you're on the air welcome
[02:47:19.480 --> 02:47:25.480]  alex um real quick during the uh the hype for the mcrystal pinger on npr
[02:47:25.480 --> 02:47:28.840]  the mineral management service now has a new name
[02:47:28.840 --> 02:47:34.280]  it'll be the bureau of ocean energy management and regulation enforcement
[02:47:34.280 --> 02:47:41.000]  um so snuck that in under wire um do you about that no i didn't you're saying
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.960]  of course what they're creating a new federal agency
[02:47:43.960 --> 02:47:47.080]  yeah well they're going to turn the old one that was in charge of the gulf
[02:47:47.080 --> 02:47:52.920]  uh fiasco into a new regulatory thing um and the other the other question i
[02:47:52.920 --> 02:47:56.840]  had for you is do you think that's the crystal thing could be
[02:47:56.840 --> 02:48:02.280]  um positioning portrays for presidential run
[02:48:02.280 --> 02:48:06.040]  oh that we know they're lining portray us up as the vice presidential candidate
[02:48:06.040 --> 02:48:09.800]  with mr socialist health care so republicans
[02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:13.880]  in the past would elect mit romney now because they love to vote for socialists
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:18.600]  who have good hair uh but now every incumbent everyone's
[02:48:18.600 --> 02:48:22.040]  seen as an establishment candidate is being shot down
[02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:26.280]  and we have the republican media saying you better vote for mainline republicans
[02:48:26.280 --> 02:48:30.360]  you know not for tea party people like alex jones that's in the washington
[02:48:30.360 --> 02:48:33.480]  post today that alex jones don't be like him yeah
[02:48:33.480 --> 02:48:36.920]  because then you'll stand out then the people will know you're real
[02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:40.280]  then you'll win you've got the republican establishment
[02:48:40.280 --> 02:48:43.080]  and the democratic establishment who are all intermarried and part of the
[02:48:43.080 --> 02:48:47.880]  criminal syndicate trying to keep control of both of their parties
[02:48:47.880 --> 02:48:51.560]  and keep them on the big government reservation and they're going to fail
[02:48:51.560 --> 02:48:55.640]  and uh i mean all of this all i know is
[02:48:55.640 --> 02:48:59.240]  micristal doing what he did he knew it was going to come out
[02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:03.240]  and yes they are positioning uh portray us
[02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:06.840]  but again portray us having a seizure you better believe that when he starts
[02:49:06.840 --> 02:49:10.440]  running for president nothing against people that have seizures but the media
[02:49:10.440 --> 02:49:12.920]  is going to have a field day with that saying you can't have a commander in
[02:49:12.920 --> 02:49:16.520]  chief that collapses and he clearly had a seizure
[02:49:16.520 --> 02:49:20.040]  i think that's a big strike against portray us you know the leader
[02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:24.200]  has got a you know look like he's healthy and tough and virile
[02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:28.040]  i mean that's just like with uh franklindelina roosevelt they hid the fact
[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:31.400]  he was in a wheelchair the american people didn't even know he was in a
[02:49:31.400 --> 02:49:34.680]  wheelchair that's how bamboozled they were
[02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:38.440]  i mean i'm not saying it's bad to be in a wheelchair what matters is what somebody
[02:49:38.440 --> 02:49:42.280]  thinks and believes and stands for but the issue is in this petty world
[02:49:42.280 --> 02:49:46.120]  where all that matters is the color of your hair and how stylish it is and
[02:49:46.120 --> 02:49:49.960]  you know do you look like a ladies man uh that this is a big strike
[02:49:49.960 --> 02:49:55.640]  against uh portray us and can i say one thing alex yes sir
[02:49:55.640 --> 02:50:00.680]  um i am starting a sort of facebook thing anti-war to coma i'm gonna try to
[02:50:00.680 --> 02:50:03.880]  protest our congressman norm dick's when they start to
[02:50:03.880 --> 02:50:07.720]  move forward with the strike so if anyone out here is looking into coma
[02:50:07.720 --> 02:50:11.720]  contact me on facebook and let's let's uh let's raise our voices
[02:50:11.720 --> 02:50:14.600]  all right buddy good job there everybody needs to get organized i mean it

[02:50:18.280 --> 02:50:21.080]  it doesn't matter if it's you know three of you out there against water
[02:50:21.080 --> 02:50:24.360]  fluoridation that's how big things start we know
[02:50:24.360 --> 02:50:27.720]  if we just sit here on our hands we're not going to have an effect
[02:50:27.720 --> 02:50:32.920]  i mean i never intended 16 years ago it was about really 17 months we're getting
[02:50:32.920 --> 02:50:36.280]  politically active i never intended been on air
[02:50:36.280 --> 02:50:42.440]  15 years to be where i am now i could have never imagined it
[02:50:42.440 --> 02:50:45.800]  uh i would have tried to grow earlier or faster or
[02:50:45.800 --> 02:50:49.640]  but you can't go back hindsight's 2020 as they say

[02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:03.800]  it's all acts of war now the media is now saying they've got super missiles
[02:55:03.800 --> 02:55:09.000]  uh that can hit the united states it it's all an exact replay of the lies about
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:14.360]  wmds seven years ago in the lead up to the attack on iraq
[02:55:14.360 --> 02:55:22.280]  after a decade plus of crippling sanctions and it's all about empire
[02:55:22.280 --> 02:55:26.360]  and the american people are distracted with oil spills and macrystal
[02:55:26.360 --> 02:55:30.120]  and the rest of it uh let's go ahead and go to
[02:55:30.120 --> 02:55:34.440]  john in washington john you're on the air

[02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:42.760]  use about as hard as finding a politician with a conscience of a moral
[02:55:42.760 --> 02:55:47.880]  standard somewhere uh this is unreal it's it's
[02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:51.800]  i listened to your show about 13 14 years ago and i'll admit back then i
[02:55:51.800 --> 02:55:55.640]  thought you were whacked out but i'm waking up today
[02:55:55.640 --> 02:55:59.320]  things going on around me and it is totally complete tyranny
[02:55:59.320 --> 02:56:03.240]  and like you said before it's a total repeat of history
[02:56:03.240 --> 02:56:07.080]  when we left england and came to america we left because
[02:56:07.080 --> 02:56:11.400]  we were slaves we were sars we're to the nth degree
[02:56:11.400 --> 02:56:16.280]  uh they were taxing the air we were breathing if you stop and think about
[02:56:16.280 --> 02:56:19.480]  it that's what this co2 thing is too they're gonna start taxing us to the
[02:56:19.480 --> 02:56:22.920]  air we're breathing i remember people a decade ago
[02:56:22.920 --> 02:56:26.440]  i remember the movie space balls a comedy where
[02:56:26.440 --> 02:56:31.080]  they're taxing the air and now that's what this is
[02:56:31.080 --> 02:56:36.040]  exactly exactly and then obama was quoted yesterday heard on another radio
[02:56:36.040 --> 02:56:39.960]  show where he said there's an opposition raising to obama's
[02:56:39.960 --> 02:56:44.920]  obama carry said i'm not going back my question is mr sataro
[02:56:44.920 --> 02:56:48.920]  what are you afraid of going back to the constitution
[02:56:48.920 --> 02:56:52.920]  we the people or uh are you afraid of going back
[02:56:52.920 --> 02:56:55.880]  capitalism what is it your friend what do you think what
[02:56:55.880 --> 02:57:01.000]  what do you think of obama saying america is about institutions not
[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:04.600]  individuals i think he's just a total dictator and
[02:57:04.600 --> 02:57:09.400]  there was a report earlier today too uh that they're talking about an executive
[02:57:09.400 --> 02:57:13.320]  order to get the industry he's already hijacked arizona
[02:57:13.320 --> 02:57:18.280]  oh yeah he signed an executive order federalizing what food you can eat and
[02:57:18.280 --> 02:57:21.560]  how much salt can be in food and now they're going to try to implement
[02:57:21.560 --> 02:57:25.720]  where the federal government controls everything
[02:57:25.720 --> 02:57:30.200]  i tell you alex if we don't find a way whether the state or federal level
[02:57:30.200 --> 02:57:36.120]  to indict these people the sorrows is the cfr the federal reserve if we don't
[02:57:36.120 --> 02:57:39.400]  find a way to expose this in the mainstream
[02:57:39.400 --> 02:57:43.960]  and for a prosecute these people then unfortunately someday
[02:57:43.960 --> 02:57:46.840]  we're going to wake up and realize this time for another civil war
[02:57:46.840 --> 02:57:51.480]  well matt i hear you and they want to push us into a physical civil war
[02:57:51.480 --> 02:57:55.720]  because they think they might be able to win that or finagle that or use that as
[02:57:55.720 --> 02:57:59.640]  an excuse to shut down free speech the reason they're coming in wanting to
[02:57:59.640 --> 02:58:04.120]  restrict the the internet openly and you know the best way to expose the
[02:58:04.120 --> 02:58:07.480]  dictators make a mac like one the best way to bring them down is to make a mac
[02:58:07.480 --> 02:58:11.000]  like one like macro vero he says and that's true
[02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:15.480]  uh by them coming out and saying they want to take the web over

[03:09:16.920 --> 03:09:20.280]  lot of the work i see on bill berg that others have written about is is uh
[03:09:20.280 --> 03:09:27.560]  you know uh mirrored uh previously by uh our guest dr john colman's

[03:09:53.720 --> 03:09:57.480]  to those but this information is all so important but but first just
[03:09:57.480 --> 03:10:01.640]  some quick answers from his perspective of a doctor john colman
[03:10:01.640 --> 03:10:05.320]  uh john specifically from all i see
[03:10:05.320 --> 03:10:08.280]  there's a quickening happening an acceleration
[03:10:08.280 --> 03:10:12.280]  the controllers are moving on every front if you say had five minutes on
[03:10:12.280 --> 03:10:15.960]  national television uh you're reaching millions of people
[03:10:15.960 --> 03:10:20.280]  and you are reaching millions here to have a quick synopsis
[03:10:20.280 --> 03:10:25.880]  of the peril the planets in the position the globalists are in
[03:10:25.880 --> 03:10:29.560]  and what we can do to stop what's happening what would you say
[03:10:29.560 --> 03:10:32.840]  i think that the best way to look at this is to take it from the point of
[03:10:32.840 --> 03:10:37.000]  view of country by country the united states we know is in the hands of
[03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:40.920]  socialism which was always the goal ever since the days of frank and de
[03:10:40.920 --> 03:10:45.560]  reciprocal and they used many contract situations to get this to get as far as
[03:10:45.560 --> 03:10:48.040]  they have the point of the thinking of a list of
[03:10:48.040 --> 03:10:51.960]  tanya to get america into world war one and the other
[03:10:51.960 --> 03:10:56.280]  contract situation the gulf of thompson to get us into world war two
[03:10:56.280 --> 03:11:00.920]  and the turning over of china to the communists
[03:11:00.920 --> 03:11:05.480]  austrian japan from the rain man all these things and now the united states
[03:11:05.480 --> 03:11:10.120]  we definitely have a social struggle i don't think anybody would doubt that
[03:11:10.120 --> 03:11:14.040]  anybody who's done any study as to what socialism actually means
[03:11:14.040 --> 03:11:17.960]  i think they all agree that we in the grip of socialism in america
[03:11:17.960 --> 03:11:22.440]  and this of course means that it's all working in canon towards the one world
[03:11:22.440 --> 03:11:25.960]  government inside a new world order which i've written about
[03:11:25.960 --> 03:11:29.400]  extensively in all of my books particularly
[03:11:29.400 --> 03:11:33.240]  the tabletop institute and the committee of three hundred
[03:11:33.240 --> 03:11:37.400]  but not only those books other books as well
[03:11:37.400 --> 03:11:41.640]  well the globalist uh... mainly sinnering in and around britain for my research
[03:11:41.640 --> 03:11:45.240]  and i cover this in my film in game blueprint for global enslavement
[03:11:45.240 --> 03:11:49.160]  what is the endgame dot com is the website as an online bibliography
[03:11:49.160 --> 03:11:51.640]  uh... for the film like a book
[03:11:51.640 --> 03:11:55.960]  uh... and also an index for the film so people can see the proof that's in the
[03:11:55.960 --> 03:11:57.800]  film for themselves
[03:11:57.800 --> 03:12:01.160]  it's an open conspiracy the title of hg wells book
[03:12:01.160 --> 03:12:04.520]  a world socialist government destroying the family
[03:12:04.520 --> 03:12:09.720]  scientifically having the state uh... have you know basically remove children
[03:12:09.720 --> 03:12:12.680]  like you remove the eggs from a hand using our well quote
[03:12:12.680 --> 03:12:16.360]  of course he was part of british intelligence all of that going on
[03:12:16.360 --> 03:12:20.600]  and that they would slowly get control of society
[03:12:20.600 --> 03:12:23.800]  and now we've gone through that hundred year period and now they're going into
[03:12:23.800 --> 03:12:28.120]  their endgame giant wars to exterminate us you name it
[03:12:28.120 --> 03:12:31.720]  and you know you read all this hoxley you read uh...
[03:12:31.720 --> 03:12:36.200]  murchin russell uh... you read the wedge woods all these people are public
[03:12:36.200 --> 03:12:38.360]  they all write government textbooks
[03:12:38.360 --> 03:12:43.560]  i've got john p holdren's textbook the white house science always has a planetary regime
[03:12:43.560 --> 03:12:47.080]  we're going to put chemicals in the water to sterilize you i mean this is
[03:12:47.080 --> 03:12:51.400]  really an open conspiracy but they know the general public is not reading
[03:12:51.400 --> 03:12:53.800]  what these elites have said and done so i think
[03:12:53.800 --> 03:12:58.120]  speak to that and then the tapestock institute your research into it being a
[03:12:58.120 --> 03:13:02.760]  key node in the actual command and control system
[03:13:02.760 --> 03:13:06.360]  but of course and you know if one of the people i mentioned in my book
[03:13:06.360 --> 03:13:11.000]  tapestock institute is edward bernay's he was a nephew of Freud
[03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:17.080]  the gentleman who led the so-called scientific scrambling of the brains
[03:13:17.080 --> 03:13:21.000]  and then you have the coast the country turned over to social engineering
[03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:25.640]  and social scientists all in the one big that they like cogs in this giant big
[03:13:25.640 --> 03:13:30.600]  machine propelling us against our will if we but
[03:13:30.600 --> 03:13:35.320]  stop the realization towards the new world order as fast as they can go
[03:13:35.320 --> 03:13:38.440]  and you take all the walls that have been fought
[03:13:38.440 --> 03:13:42.440]  what has there been what has been the origin economic or was it
[03:13:42.440 --> 03:13:46.040]  economic in origin and of course the idea was to destroy the wealth
[03:13:46.040 --> 03:13:49.960]  of the nations and put it all in the hands of the committee of 300
[03:13:49.960 --> 03:13:53.080]  and we see that happening in the united states as well today
[03:13:53.080 --> 03:13:57.480]  there's no question about that that's as far advanced
[03:13:58.200 --> 03:14:02.200]  will continue flesh out the research you did into the tapestock institute tell
[03:14:02.200 --> 03:14:05.640]  people about it what the organization does i mean i've
[03:14:05.640 --> 03:14:08.920]  actually visited the tapestock institute i didn't go in it
[03:14:08.920 --> 03:14:13.160]  but i noticed that the london bus bombing on seven seven blew up
[03:14:13.160 --> 03:14:16.600]  right in front of the tapestock institute so i went there days after the bombing
[03:14:16.600 --> 03:14:20.120]  and talked to eyewitnesses for my film terror storm
[03:14:20.120 --> 03:14:24.360]  well the tapestock institute was unknown and to the people of the united states
[03:14:24.360 --> 03:14:28.840]  and i don't like it to my own own but i think the existence
[03:14:28.840 --> 03:14:34.120]  was first exposed in my 1969 monograph the stomach the tapestock institute of
[03:14:34.120 --> 03:14:37.320]  humanization Britain's control of the united states
[03:14:37.320 --> 03:14:42.280]  i think after that time tapestock had very successfully retained the secret
[03:14:42.280 --> 03:14:45.640]  of role in creating the affairs of the united states
[03:14:45.640 --> 03:14:49.400]  its government its people since its very early beginning in
[03:14:49.400 --> 03:14:53.080]  london in 1913 and they set up shop at a place called
[03:14:53.080 --> 03:14:57.400]  willings and house and that originally was set up in order to
[03:14:57.400 --> 03:15:02.760]  coerce the british public into the first world war and then the american public
[03:15:02.760 --> 03:15:06.120]  that had no wish to be in this war whatsoever
[03:15:06.120 --> 03:15:10.600]  and the project was given by the british government
[03:15:10.600 --> 03:15:14.440]  to the harm's worth brothers lord rovermire and lord north blip
[03:15:14.440 --> 03:15:17.720]  and their mandate was to produce an organization
[03:15:17.720 --> 03:15:23.000]  capable of uniting public opinion and directing that manufactured opinion
[03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:28.040]  down the desired path which is important for a deprivation of war by great
[03:15:28.040 --> 03:15:32.120]  britain against germany funding was provided by the british royal
[03:15:32.120 --> 03:15:36.920]  family and later by the ross chas to whom lord north
[03:15:36.920 --> 03:15:42.840]  north blip was related to marriage honor 20 was registered as director of
[03:15:42.840 --> 03:15:47.640]  future studies at the world institute of international affairs
[03:15:47.640 --> 03:15:52.680]  two americans waltz and lippmann and edward bernese were appointed to handle
[03:15:52.680 --> 03:15:57.640]  an affiliation of britain and the british and the american public opinion
[03:15:57.640 --> 03:16:02.280]  in preparation for entry of the united states into world war one
[03:16:02.280 --> 03:16:05.160]  and to breathe in direct president woodrow wilson
[03:16:05.160 --> 03:16:09.800]  was coined the conjugate on changing british public opinion
[03:16:09.800 --> 03:16:13.720]  and you know everything boils down to what the public perception of something
[03:16:13.720 --> 03:16:17.960]  is and if you have a population that's 80 percent
[03:16:17.960 --> 03:16:22.680]  opposed to your objective being the government then the first part of us to do
[03:16:22.680 --> 03:16:25.640]  one by changing that public opinion to that which
[03:16:25.640 --> 03:16:29.400]  you wanted and that's why they set up this very
[03:16:29.400 --> 03:16:36.600]  scientific organization and then they had a big upset in 1930
[03:16:36.600 --> 03:16:39.800]  because the two brothers north blip and arms over
[03:16:39.800 --> 03:16:43.880]  didn't see eye to eye and lord rossner
[03:16:43.880 --> 03:16:48.440]  broke away from wellington house and in world war two actually became an ardent
[03:16:48.440 --> 03:16:52.360]  supporter of that officer and he vehemently opposed the war with
[03:16:52.360 --> 03:16:55.720]  germany and after one such word director lord
[03:16:55.720 --> 03:16:57.880]  rossner returned to london and denounced those
[03:16:57.880 --> 03:17:02.040]  cameras for war with it as supporters of the boss of it
[03:17:02.040 --> 03:17:07.080]  which just goes to show how easily really public opinion can display them
[03:17:07.080 --> 03:17:13.080]  noted and formed and the arms of brothers then
[03:17:13.080 --> 03:17:17.960]  came into a lot of money and they began publishing a weekly news that brought
[03:17:17.960 --> 03:17:21.960]  answers to correspondence in which questions were sent in
[03:17:21.960 --> 03:17:29.880]  and were answered by 1994 the brothers were able to
[03:17:29.880 --> 03:17:33.560]  produce and purchase the evening news which began
[03:17:33.560 --> 03:17:38.040]  copying american format as a result of that the daily mail was first
[03:17:38.040 --> 03:17:41.960]  published in London as an eight page newspaper which
[03:17:41.960 --> 03:17:45.480]  was to have a penny in those days
[03:17:45.480 --> 03:17:48.920]  slogan sold the paper that's how small these people become
[03:17:48.920 --> 03:17:53.080]  they knew that slogans would sell the paper and they knew that
[03:17:53.080 --> 03:17:56.440]  they could do this by catering to a new reading public
[03:17:56.440 --> 03:18:01.080]  well isn't there maxim or credo that perception is reality
[03:18:01.080 --> 03:18:05.880]  that's what they say that's exactly what they say but they have to have these
[03:18:05.880 --> 03:18:09.240]  enormous mind-bending mind control organization
[03:18:09.240 --> 03:18:14.200]  to change the public perception it's not good to read the evidence reality of
[03:18:14.200 --> 03:18:17.880]  people totally opposed to a war unless you can change that
[03:18:17.880 --> 03:18:24.280]  that's your first battle in any war and we relied to eight years ago about
[03:18:24.280 --> 03:18:27.800]  iraq they're repeating the exact same propaganda about secret
[03:18:27.800 --> 03:18:32.760]  missiles secret nukes al-qaeda is in iran even though
[03:18:32.760 --> 03:18:35.880]  iran's Shiite even though the u.s. government has four al-qaeda
[03:18:35.880 --> 03:18:40.200]  groups publicly attacking iran iran sits there and takes it
[03:18:40.200 --> 03:18:44.280]  and they use the exact same propaganda again on the sheeple
[03:18:44.280 --> 03:18:48.200]  and then they had that propaganda about a trillion dollars in lithium last week
[03:18:48.200 --> 03:18:52.360]  when that's old news as well as if the american people are going to get a
[03:18:52.360 --> 03:18:56.280]  trillion dollars even if that was there we're going to pay to go steal it
[03:18:56.280 --> 03:18:59.400]  we're going to pay for it we're not going to get it
[03:18:59.400 --> 03:19:03.160]  exactly exactly i couldn't put it better myself
[03:19:03.160 --> 03:19:07.320]  anyway these organizations were set up they brought up a new language all
[03:19:07.320 --> 03:19:10.680]  together like regime change and collateral damage
[03:19:10.680 --> 03:19:14.760]  that became almost a new english language all better yet the tapestry of
[03:19:14.760 --> 03:19:19.160]  english language and with us they modified
[03:19:19.160 --> 03:19:25.560]  to suit their medical conditions and president wasn't set up the very first
[03:19:25.560 --> 03:19:29.720]  tapestry methodology techniques for polling have to manifest in so-called
[03:19:29.720 --> 03:19:33.720]  public opinion they also thought that there was a secret
[03:19:33.720 --> 03:19:37.000]  body of managers that was the first time this ever happened in america
[03:19:37.000 --> 03:19:40.360]  of course this wasn't happening all right let's talk about the scientific
[03:19:40.360 --> 03:19:44.280]  dictatorship and these secret managers when we get back because now they're
[03:19:44.280 --> 03:19:46.600]  not even secret i mean we get the spp
[03:19:46.600 --> 03:19:49.800]  north american union documents and it's a scientific board
[03:19:49.800 --> 03:19:53.320]  with a corporate board telling the government what to do and the government
[03:19:53.320 --> 03:20:01.960]  collects its heels and says yes sir
[03:20:01.960 --> 03:20:05.560]  gold isn't for you ted anderson president of mitis resources one of the
[03:20:05.560 --> 03:20:09.480]  world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms i get it you wouldn't
[03:20:09.480 --> 03:20:12.920]  buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job
[03:20:12.920 --> 03:20:16.520]  that the fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy
[03:20:16.520 --> 03:20:20.040]  that social security would be there for you that's not what's happening
[03:20:20.040 --> 03:20:24.600]  you might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation

[03:23:58.120 --> 03:24:01.320]  nine two five six
[03:24:14.680 --> 03:24:18.200]  look we know what the british empire model
[03:24:18.200 --> 03:24:21.320]  has done around the world
[03:24:22.840 --> 03:24:27.720]  and it's a system of control and dr john colman has written extensively on
[03:24:27.720 --> 03:24:31.720]  and i found his research to be excellent so you were getting into these
[03:24:31.720 --> 03:24:35.080]  committees of experts these shadow governments
[03:24:35.080 --> 03:24:38.600]  that are now out in the open it's now not denied you'd write about this stuff
[03:24:38.600 --> 03:24:42.760]  30 40 years ago people laugh now it's somewhat public
[03:24:42.760 --> 03:24:46.200]  i want to speak about how those organizations uh you know the command
[03:24:46.200 --> 03:24:50.120]  structure that you've identified and then i want to get into how's their
[03:24:50.120 --> 03:24:54.360]  operation going for them uh because i see them having success but
[03:24:54.360 --> 03:24:59.000]  they're being revealed more and more uh and brzezinski and others have said
[03:24:59.000 --> 03:25:02.600]  that they believe they're starting to get into trouble
[03:25:02.600 --> 03:25:06.840]  i think that was kept their bounds as far as being too confident i think
[03:25:06.840 --> 03:25:10.600]  they felt that progress is such a degree that they could now come more and more
[03:25:10.600 --> 03:25:14.440]  out into the open and i think that was a mistake you know
[03:25:14.440 --> 03:25:18.440]  going back to the warriors this was when they really came into their own
[03:25:18.440 --> 03:25:24.120]  through the strategic bombing survey and to uh things about the program surveys
[03:25:24.120 --> 03:25:28.120]  for the department of agriculture which uh
[03:25:28.120 --> 03:25:31.480]  from which major studies you're undertaking in the techniques of mass
[03:25:31.480 --> 03:25:35.640]  persuasion you'd never think to look under the
[03:25:35.640 --> 03:25:39.160]  agriculture department for something called mass persuasion
[03:25:39.160 --> 03:25:42.200]  i don't think you would unless you were given the key
[03:25:42.200 --> 03:25:46.440]  but i was told to look over there and that by the late
[03:25:46.440 --> 03:25:51.400]  senator erwin would help me so much in my constitutional work
[03:25:51.400 --> 03:25:56.600]  and there i find that they had all kinds of things hidden under the
[03:25:56.600 --> 03:25:59.240]  agricultural board for instance there was a guy called
[03:25:59.240 --> 03:26:02.520]  berlin carcutt who wrote a textbook document
[03:26:02.520 --> 03:26:06.760]  type of some principles of mass persuasion and these
[03:26:06.760 --> 03:26:12.360]  principles are still in use today and another major agency for shaping public
[03:26:12.360 --> 03:26:16.120]  opinion was the office of war information which of course is
[03:26:16.120 --> 03:26:19.960]  falling away but this just indication of how these
[03:26:19.960 --> 03:26:26.200]  people started out they started out from a position of great secrecy
[03:26:26.200 --> 03:26:30.440]  and many of their committees and secret organizations
[03:26:30.440 --> 03:26:34.680]  were very difficult to discover because they hid them under different building
[03:26:34.680 --> 03:26:39.160]  booths or plate booths in the congressional record
[03:26:39.160 --> 03:26:42.440]  which had nothing to do with the subject that you're looking for
[03:26:42.440 --> 03:26:47.160]  i know when i wrote my book on the constitution i was told by senator
[03:26:47.160 --> 03:26:50.920]  erwin to be diligent and to look through all the
[03:26:50.920 --> 03:26:54.200]  congressional records i find and to date i've read
[03:26:54.200 --> 03:26:57.080]  and i say read like you read the book at the good unit british
[03:26:57.080 --> 03:27:01.240]  university and i've studied on these things intently
[03:27:01.240 --> 03:27:06.760]  and i've covered so far 37 000 pages which i think is something of a record
[03:27:06.760 --> 03:27:09.880]  i doubt whether anybody else in the country that's done that
[03:27:09.880 --> 03:27:13.240]  and as a result of that i was again some rather unique insights into the
[03:27:13.240 --> 03:27:17.720]  constitution and one of the big things i find today
[03:27:17.720 --> 03:27:22.520]  that is you saw an open saw festering saw in the united states
[03:27:22.520 --> 03:27:27.560]  in fact there's so many wars are propagated without
[03:27:27.560 --> 03:27:32.280]  a declaration of war being given by the congress that's a joint session of the
[03:27:32.280 --> 03:27:35.880]  house and the senate and i think many of the evils that have
[03:27:35.880 --> 03:27:39.720]  written from that are plaguing us today more than ever
[03:27:39.720 --> 03:27:43.960]  it's not i say it's not a subject that's you know gone away
[03:27:43.960 --> 03:27:48.840]  the uh... it's all right to talk about it today because it's very it's very much
[03:27:48.840 --> 03:27:52.200]  in sync with what is happening
[03:27:53.000 --> 03:27:56.760]  but this is good news i mean everybody i talked to not just my own research that
[03:27:56.760 --> 03:27:59.800]  i respect and my own gut sense of history
[03:27:59.800 --> 03:28:03.880]  but the statements by the controllers themselves that are in you know an
[03:28:03.880 --> 03:28:07.800]  internal memorandum not secret but hidden in plain view
[03:28:07.800 --> 03:28:11.160]  they are talking about facing more and more crises
[03:28:11.160 --> 03:28:15.640]  uh... and they understand that they are starting to lose control i
[03:28:15.640 --> 03:28:19.560]  i think that is if people aren't aware
[03:28:19.560 --> 03:28:23.400]  of the manipulation then they're powerless to fight it but no matter how
[03:28:23.400 --> 03:28:26.520]  sophisticated brainwashing and manipulation is
[03:28:26.520 --> 03:28:30.760]  once you're aware of it and start looking for it
[03:28:30.760 --> 03:28:34.280]  then instead of brainwashing you and pacifying you
[03:28:34.280 --> 03:28:39.000]  it irritates you it actually uh... actually spurs you
[03:28:39.000 --> 03:28:42.520]  like a dog barking next door to go tell your neighbor to you know
[03:28:42.520 --> 03:28:47.160]  take it inside i mean i see this really starting to turn
[03:28:47.160 --> 03:28:51.160]  the tide is turning i absolutely concur with that
[03:28:51.160 --> 03:28:55.080]  i think very much so and i think it's more and more it's coming to the
[03:28:55.080 --> 03:28:59.640]  realization of american people that their substance their money has been wasted
[03:28:59.640 --> 03:29:02.920]  on wars but they've not thanked that they've not certified
[03:29:02.920 --> 03:29:06.280]  or given the effort to i mean the last time
[03:29:06.280 --> 03:29:10.840]  we had a declaration of war i think was when
[03:29:10.840 --> 03:29:14.200]  when truman took dead war i think that was the last one
[03:29:14.200 --> 03:29:18.680]  and then of course the second world war was also but that preceded truman
[03:29:18.680 --> 03:29:22.440]  anyway those are the few times that we've had a declaration of war
[03:29:22.440 --> 03:29:28.120]  which is a five step complicated program that has to be taken in fact the
[03:29:28.120 --> 03:29:31.560]  founding fathers they argued and struggled with war
[03:29:31.560 --> 03:29:35.480]  but they did with anything else in the constitution
[03:29:35.480 --> 03:29:39.480]  i've been reading some of the segments they made and
[03:29:39.480 --> 03:29:42.760]  well stay there long segment coming up that was a short segment let's talk
[03:29:42.760 --> 03:29:47.160]  about how big a deal it was and all the checks and balances involved in
[03:29:47.160 --> 03:29:51.480]  declaring war versus what is done today
[03:29:51.480 --> 03:29:55.320]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[03:29:55.320 --> 03:30:00.760]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:30:00.760 --> 03:30:05.800]  they helped to create a new world order we are part of a new world order a new
[03:30:05.800 --> 03:30:08.680]  world order based upon collective

[03:30:19.640 --> 03:30:23.480]  under their control the united nations would take over america
[03:30:23.480 --> 03:30:28.280]  the trilateral commission would control the world invisible empire chronicles
[03:30:28.280 --> 03:30:32.040]  how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to

[03:37:02.520 --> 03:37:08.920]  continuing in the last 24 minutes or so we have left
[03:37:08.920 --> 03:37:12.920]  in layman's terms for folks from your deep study over 40 years
[03:37:12.920 --> 03:37:18.120]  what is the globalist in-game plan what is their
[03:37:18.120 --> 03:37:21.800]  final operation because from their own documents i've read it's establish a
[03:37:21.800 --> 03:37:25.800]  world government isolate the individual break up the family
[03:37:25.800 --> 03:37:33.960]  and then through covert GMO food poisons in the water and drugs
[03:37:33.960 --> 03:37:39.240]  basically anesthetize sterilize and reduce world population
[03:37:39.240 --> 03:37:42.520]  that's correct that's absolutely right there's all of those and more
[03:37:42.520 --> 03:37:47.080]  ones of some of the companies like monsanto are producing seed but
[03:37:47.080 --> 03:37:51.640]  you have to you can't harvest some of it and then plant it again next year you
[03:37:51.640 --> 03:37:55.160]  have to buy a new seed all the time and it doesn't the shelf life of it is
[03:37:55.160 --> 03:37:59.000]  pretty short things of that nature in other words
[03:37:59.000 --> 03:38:02.600]  the supply of food will be lessen to such an extent that
[03:38:02.600 --> 03:38:06.200]  you know it was uh their senior statement lord butchered
[03:38:06.200 --> 03:38:11.160]  lord butchered russell who said that the world is populated with too many
[03:38:11.160 --> 03:38:14.840]  useless eaters that's the likes of us you and me
[03:38:14.840 --> 03:38:18.760]  and he said something has to be done about he said what we need to do is
[03:38:18.760 --> 03:38:22.680]  reintroduce a plague that'll happen every now and then and wipe away at
[03:38:22.680 --> 03:38:26.840]  least 20 million of the population which he called
[03:38:26.840 --> 03:38:30.840]  was supposed to our requirements and then he said we have a manageable
[03:38:30.840 --> 03:38:37.560]  population will not only be subservient but very easy to control
[03:38:37.560 --> 03:38:41.400]  they will be dependent on the government for everything
[03:38:41.400 --> 03:38:45.880]  so that basically is the blueprint for the new world order
[03:38:45.880 --> 03:38:51.160]  one world government please continue please continue
[03:38:51.160 --> 03:38:55.480]  adjust our population
[03:38:55.640 --> 03:39:00.120]  and then they in turn have controlled but i would call the top dogs in the
[03:39:00.120 --> 03:39:03.240]  committee of 300 and then many of them in america
[03:39:03.240 --> 03:39:06.520]  we have some families of not with and of course in
[03:39:06.520 --> 03:39:11.320]  england that we have the loyalty some of the old european kings and queens
[03:39:11.320 --> 03:39:15.080]  are still alive and still controlling this body as well
[03:39:15.080 --> 03:39:19.160]  and it's a very comprehensive machine it's rather like a
[03:39:19.160 --> 03:39:23.320]  like a kind of manufacturing company at the top you have
[03:39:23.320 --> 03:39:26.520]  the CEO then you have the board of directors
[03:39:26.520 --> 03:39:31.240]  then you have the management and you have the middle management then you have
[03:39:31.240 --> 03:39:35.720]  all the controllers on the shop floor and so on and so forth right down to the
[03:39:35.720 --> 03:39:40.280]  the lowest individual working in the packing department to ship the goods
[03:39:40.280 --> 03:39:45.080]  and this is really the format for the new world order
[03:39:45.080 --> 03:39:49.560]  what they have to achieve and they all brag about it they all write about it
[03:39:49.560 --> 03:39:53.160]  and and and talk about what minor was scum we are and from my research but
[03:39:53.160 --> 03:39:57.320]  correct me if i'm wrong and expand on it these are the ultimate control freaks
[03:39:57.320 --> 03:40:01.240]  and the ultimate jealous envious people to the point
[03:40:01.240 --> 03:40:05.320]  of they want to control the future they only want their progeny to go into the
[03:40:05.320 --> 03:40:09.320]  future and they hate healthy happy people
[03:40:09.320 --> 03:40:12.840]  they hate individual wealth and middle classes
[03:40:12.840 --> 03:40:17.800]  they hate i mean their true pleasure is death and sickness and illness
[03:40:17.800 --> 03:40:21.880]  and people being dumbed down and they they revel in how they're poisoning us
[03:40:21.880 --> 03:40:25.080]  and dumbing us down and it's really their ultimate
[03:40:25.080 --> 03:40:30.920]  mass psychopathic uh orchestra or symphony of destruction
[03:40:30.920 --> 03:40:36.600]  to be carrying this out well the leader of the school as i said
[03:40:36.600 --> 03:40:40.200]  of this concert i was a lord but from grussel
[03:40:40.200 --> 03:40:43.800]  and that's exactly his point of view they're far too many of us with two
[03:40:43.800 --> 03:40:47.560]  rebellious with two independent we need to be
[03:40:47.560 --> 03:40:51.880]  thinned out by plagues of coming every year he said actually that the wars have
[03:40:51.880 --> 03:40:55.480]  been either too very disappointing hadn't killed enough people
[03:40:55.480 --> 03:40:59.560]  and when you think of the horrendous casualties
[03:40:59.560 --> 03:41:03.320]  of world war one then you get some idea
[03:41:03.320 --> 03:41:08.520]  of the extent of what these people are trying and he was given a Nobel prize all
[03:41:08.520 --> 03:41:14.040]  these guys i mean take a take take watson the head of ibm
[03:41:14.040 --> 03:41:17.320]  human genome project not the founder of ibm but the but the head of the genome
[03:41:17.320 --> 03:41:19.400]  project i put him in in game three and a half
[03:41:19.400 --> 03:41:23.640]  years ago as a top eugenicist but a year later he said basically blacks weren't
[03:41:23.640 --> 03:41:27.160]  humans he had the discoverer of the double helix
[03:41:27.160 --> 03:41:30.600]  he had to step down but they kept it quiet because he's a
[03:41:30.600 --> 03:41:35.880]  you know kind of the uh holdren's hero and when you actually study these
[03:41:35.880 --> 03:41:40.520]  liberals they are the biggest racist and
[03:41:40.520 --> 03:41:43.480]  but they're not just wanting to kill who they see a subhuman
[03:41:43.480 --> 03:41:46.840]  they also are threatened by what they call wild suns
[03:41:46.840 --> 03:41:50.680]  and they say eugenics isn't just positive and negative it's also
[03:41:50.680 --> 03:41:55.880]  dumbing down the middle class that could threaten them so they're also because
[03:41:55.880 --> 03:41:58.200]  so many yuppie say yeah there's too many people
[03:41:58.200 --> 03:42:02.840]  it's kind of a little secret liberal enjoyment to go oh yes well we do have
[03:42:02.840 --> 03:42:06.840]  too many people haha you know so a liberal who's all
[03:42:06.840 --> 03:42:10.440]  about fighting racism will still giggle and snicker about reducing
[03:42:10.440 --> 03:42:14.680]  population what they don't understand is they're being targeted as well
[03:42:14.680 --> 03:42:19.240]  exactly they aren't aware of that but we all talk about all of us
[03:42:19.240 --> 03:42:23.560]  when they've reduced one section they're gonna get up the next and tell them
[03:42:23.560 --> 03:42:27.800]  there's nobody is going to escape their attention
[03:42:27.800 --> 03:42:31.240]  well as long doc as we expose these people and
[03:42:31.240 --> 03:42:36.200]  and really state how evil they are uh i don't see how they're going to get away
[03:42:36.200 --> 03:42:38.440]  with this and i think that's why they're rushing now
[03:42:38.440 --> 03:42:43.400]  to openly start shutting the web down but that's only a bigger wake-up call
[03:42:43.400 --> 03:42:48.520]  exactly this latest idea that they can have some key and shut off the internet
[03:42:48.520 --> 03:42:51.960]  is a very very dangerous one but it should be a wake-up call to all
[03:42:51.960 --> 03:42:55.160]  americans even those who don't bother to read books
[03:42:55.160 --> 03:43:01.160]  who don't bother to follow the news who gods of sport baseball and football
[03:43:01.160 --> 03:43:05.400]  it's a wake-up call to all of these people that are stopping people a while
[03:43:05.400 --> 03:43:10.280]  and i think the latest effort to provide a key to shut off the internet
[03:43:10.280 --> 03:43:14.680]  it's probably one of the most dangerous propositions that's come around for a
[03:43:14.680 --> 03:43:20.600]  very long time well it shows that their arrogance
[03:43:20.600 --> 03:43:24.520]  has evaporated which i i think is a sad thing i wish they were still
[03:43:24.520 --> 03:43:30.600]  full of hubris and hood spa and arrogant false aplomb because we could
[03:43:30.600 --> 03:43:35.560]  sneak up on them they now realize that that that that we are very close to
[03:43:35.560 --> 03:43:38.760]  their throat yes and that's making them all the
[03:43:38.760 --> 03:43:42.840]  more cautious and not many of their directives are
[03:43:42.840 --> 03:43:46.280]  coded today and it's difficult to understand what they're trying to get
[03:43:46.280 --> 03:43:49.960]  what they're trying to say except of course insiders who have the keys that
[03:43:49.960 --> 03:43:54.120]  are not the code they know but the mass of us people are good at
[03:43:54.120 --> 03:43:57.400]  we're not we're not supposed to know any of these things
[03:43:57.400 --> 03:44:01.640]  i was talking to a well-known doctor and uh
[03:44:01.640 --> 03:44:07.560]  off record uh she said that she'd treated a head of state
[03:44:07.560 --> 03:44:13.400]  who's a female uh a current head of state who's a female and who said yes
[03:44:13.400 --> 03:44:16.120]  i don't really know if i want to go through with this doctor because they
[03:44:16.120 --> 03:44:19.240]  know they could talk to their doctor you know i have been raised being elitist
[03:44:19.240 --> 03:44:22.680]  we are setting up a world government the extermination that we've been beta
[03:44:22.680 --> 03:44:25.400]  testing a soft kill is supposed to accelerate
[03:44:25.400 --> 03:44:27.720]  and i don't know if i want to go through with this
[03:44:27.720 --> 03:44:31.480]  and so i think as they try to really force their new order through
[03:44:31.480 --> 03:44:36.280]  and we've already pre-warned everyone that i i think we've planted booby
[03:44:36.280 --> 03:44:39.960]  traps for them into the future that are going to defeat them
[03:44:39.960 --> 03:44:43.240]  i think that's exactly right i believe that's the way to go we have to
[03:44:43.240 --> 03:44:46.200]  continue to plant these hidden mines where they
[03:44:46.200 --> 03:44:49.240]  don't see them or can't skip over them and get blown up
[03:44:49.240 --> 03:44:53.240]  that's what we need but you know we don't have people like uh
[03:44:53.240 --> 03:44:57.640]  george bushinger anymore so when he came into power he proudly announced that
[03:44:57.640 --> 03:45:01.080]  he was all for the new world order he said that's what we need and need to
[03:45:01.080 --> 03:45:06.440]  complete change in society but today they're more cautious
[03:45:06.440 --> 03:45:09.960]  well they have been to a certain extent but we have seen herman von rumpi
[03:45:09.960 --> 03:45:13.080]  and gordon brown and mankind moon of the un say
[03:45:13.080 --> 03:45:16.840]  global government is the answer to the financial crisis
[03:45:16.840 --> 03:45:20.120]  we must pay carbon taxes to the very central banks
[03:45:20.120 --> 03:45:24.280]  that engineered the collapse oh indeed i saw that as well the police prime
[03:45:24.280 --> 03:45:27.560]  minister you know quite outspoken about it
[03:45:27.560 --> 03:45:31.160]  but i think some of the american counterparts are not quite so bold
[03:45:31.160 --> 03:45:36.680]  no i agree they have tried to keep the little things to a certain extent
[03:45:36.680 --> 03:45:40.280]  but it's the pressure is so great that the bill is going to
[03:45:40.280 --> 03:45:46.440]  fly off any one of these days now let's shift gears and talk about your book
[03:45:46.440 --> 03:45:53.080]  drug war against america uh i mean cia aircraft crashing full of pure cocaine
[03:45:53.080 --> 03:45:57.160]  from the source now they just admit that we're growing the opium in afghanistan
[03:45:57.160 --> 03:46:01.160]  but we can't not grow it or the taliban will make the money i mean
[03:46:01.160 --> 03:46:04.600]  incredible spin in a nutshell from your research
[03:46:04.600 --> 03:46:09.640]  who controls the narcotics trade and and and why does government want to keep it
[03:46:09.640 --> 03:46:13.240]  illegal i want to keep the legal because they make
[03:46:13.240 --> 03:46:17.080]  more money out of it if it's legal they might be able to tax it to a certain
[03:46:17.080 --> 03:46:21.160]  extent to that would be all but this way they can make enormous profits out of
[03:46:21.160 --> 03:46:27.240]  the state of the product as well and scarcity is what controls the price
[03:46:27.240 --> 03:46:30.200]  it's a scarce commodity so of course the prices
[03:46:30.200 --> 03:46:33.320]  can go right through the ceiling and people will still buy america of course
[03:46:33.320 --> 03:46:37.480]  the biggest no-cutting uh consuming country in the world
[03:46:37.480 --> 03:46:41.240]  and the mexican government for instance constantly complains
[03:46:41.240 --> 03:46:45.880]  that we don't do enough in america to stop uh the drug trade in america
[03:46:45.880 --> 03:46:48.520]  it would just cut down if we no need for these people to
[03:46:48.520 --> 03:46:55.000]  survive to produce such huge quantities of cocaine and heroin and so forth
[03:46:55.000 --> 03:46:58.840]  and you know countries like columbia we have stationed here in all the sources
[03:46:58.840 --> 03:47:01.640]  down there but i don't think they're doing any good
[03:47:01.640 --> 03:47:08.200]  because columbia doesn't grow any of the uh the bush that produces cocaine
[03:47:08.200 --> 03:47:12.040]  that's all grown in other countries like ecudol
[03:47:12.040 --> 03:47:16.120]  and bolivia and and those countries they grow it
[03:47:16.120 --> 03:47:20.280]  they grow the bush but uh we go into columbia and there's
[03:47:20.280 --> 03:47:24.520]  nothing growing there admittedly it's the distribution point but then they
[03:47:24.520 --> 03:47:27.640]  have hundreds of other distribution points as well
[03:47:27.640 --> 03:47:31.960]  so it's like trying to put out a fire with a
[03:47:31.960 --> 03:47:36.200]  a blazing fire with a hose pipe god ordinary garden garden hose pipe
[03:47:36.200 --> 03:47:41.160]  you're welcome to come first very much well
[03:47:41.160 --> 03:47:44.920]  the skinny i've gotten from terry reid who is cia and many others and what's
[03:47:44.920 --> 03:47:47.800]  can't come out in congressional hearings is the argument is
[03:47:47.800 --> 03:47:51.160]  we must deal the drugs that is the government or most the drugs
[03:47:51.160 --> 03:47:55.080]  or someone else will take over this market and then they will get power
[03:47:55.080 --> 03:47:58.920]  out of the market and supplant american hegemony but that's not what's
[03:47:58.920 --> 03:48:02.520]  happening you decriminalize then that wipes out the price
[03:48:02.520 --> 03:48:05.880]  structure as it was 90 years ago when these drugs were legal here
[03:48:05.880 --> 03:48:11.240]  far fewer people used it you could buy cocaine heroin at the corner store
[03:48:11.240 --> 03:48:14.040]  you could send your kid down there to get it for you
[03:48:14.040 --> 03:48:17.320]  but but most people didn't use it they know that
[03:48:17.320 --> 03:48:21.720]  and they want to keep it illegal so that even if
[03:48:21.720 --> 03:48:25.160]  the big central banks don't control all of it being shipped in they control
[03:48:25.160 --> 03:48:28.600]  most of it the money still gets laundered through them
[03:48:28.600 --> 03:48:32.840]  and so that's why they're going to keep the drug trade
[03:48:32.840 --> 03:48:37.160]  wide open and forever i mean if they want to put the fire out they decriminalize
[03:48:37.160 --> 03:48:41.960]  exactly right of course the thought of the total question of who gets the money
[03:48:41.960 --> 03:48:46.360]  and how much of it i mean you take this enormous drug trade
[03:48:46.360 --> 03:48:51.160]  although we're fighting in afghanistan we have gone in there i don't quite know
[03:48:51.160 --> 03:48:55.400]  what our objective is in afghanistan i don't think many people do
[03:48:55.400 --> 03:49:00.040]  but since we've been fighting a war there the production of of the uh
[03:49:00.040 --> 03:49:03.800]  opium from poppy you know opium has gone up from four thousand
[03:49:03.800 --> 03:49:07.640]  metric from the year to six thousand a year
[03:49:07.640 --> 03:49:12.440]  actually uh the numbers i've seen is that it it it uh
[03:49:12.440 --> 03:49:16.200]  doubled within a few years triple quadrupled and just went up exponentially
[03:49:16.200 --> 03:49:21.320]  that that may even be an old number uh now it's over 90 percent of world opium
[03:49:21.320 --> 03:49:25.640]  production is in afghanistan i wouldn't surprise me in the least
[03:49:25.640 --> 03:49:29.000]  because everything is right for it there's climate for soil
[03:49:29.000 --> 03:49:32.280]  and uh and the people are it's their way of life
[03:49:32.280 --> 03:49:36.600]  if you take that you've got you wipe out the poppy field what are you going to
[03:49:36.600 --> 03:49:40.600]  give the the peasants you're growing it we tried that before we tried them to
[03:49:40.600 --> 03:49:44.360]  get to grow vegetables and they just couldn't make anything out of no
[03:49:44.360 --> 03:49:48.200]  money they couldn't give up so soon as that troops have passed
[03:49:48.200 --> 03:49:51.800]  through they went right back to growing poppies again and opium
[03:49:51.800 --> 03:49:56.440]  and of course you know pakistan is one of the main routes
[03:49:56.440 --> 03:50:00.680]  out of afghan if you afghanistan they go
[03:50:00.680 --> 03:50:04.600]  through and all these big generals in the army of pakistan they all take their
[03:50:04.600 --> 03:50:07.960]  cut out of it these caravans lead afghanistan
[03:50:07.960 --> 03:50:11.960]  they go down through the uh towards the coastline
[03:50:11.960 --> 03:50:15.160]  through the desolate nakar desert and they come out on the coastline there's
[03:50:15.160 --> 03:50:19.160]  nothing there but desert and it's impossible to follow them
[03:50:19.160 --> 03:50:23.160]  they do send planes and then these people they hide when they know the planes
[03:50:23.160 --> 03:50:27.160]  are coming because they took off and they're hiding two caves that are around
[03:50:27.160 --> 03:50:30.760]  and they go at night mainly and they get down to the uh
[03:50:30.760 --> 03:50:34.760]  the natural coast and these all these arrow bells working to take the
[03:50:34.760 --> 03:50:39.400]  boatloads of cocaine over to the opium poppies over to the
[03:50:39.400 --> 03:50:44.840]  buddhist bank of the middle east in dahran just across the not dahran

[03:54:52.600 --> 03:54:56.360]  and they were admitting that prozac and zoloft and all this stuff was
[03:54:56.360 --> 03:54:59.960]  causing heart attacks and brain damage and
[03:54:59.960 --> 03:55:03.240]  and i've read that and i pulled up the medical literature i know it causes
[03:55:03.240 --> 03:55:07.080]  suicide and there it was man i tell you this stuff is really
[03:55:07.080 --> 03:55:10.440]  starting to come out we've got an article up on
[03:55:10.440 --> 03:55:14.840]  info wars dot com israeli vows to tighten gaza blockade
[03:55:14.840 --> 03:55:19.720]  gaza blockade us media reports blockade eaves so who knows what's happening
[03:55:19.720 --> 03:55:24.360]  iran to send blockade busting ship to gaza look i don't want a war on iran
[03:55:24.360 --> 03:55:27.640]  we know they don't have nukes we know they don't have al-qaeda in their country
[03:55:27.640 --> 03:55:31.320]  we know that's all made up but at the same time iran
[03:55:31.320 --> 03:55:34.440]  dr john colman what do you think they're doing i mean i don't want world war
[03:55:34.440 --> 03:55:37.400]  three to start but isn't this provocative of iran to
[03:55:37.400 --> 03:55:40.760]  be doing this just asking for israel to nukem
[03:55:40.760 --> 03:55:45.000]  yes i think this is the closest we've been for a long time to the third world war
[03:55:45.000 --> 03:55:48.600]  starting and if anybody makes a misstep in this
[03:55:48.600 --> 03:55:52.920]  situation that's what's going to happen i think we're very close to a third world
[03:55:52.920 --> 03:55:57.000]  war and this cooler has prevailed and i don't see anybody
[03:55:57.000 --> 03:56:00.040]  big enough and strong enough to be that coolhead
[03:56:00.040 --> 03:56:06.200]  so we're living very perilous times why do the global controllers want to attack
[03:56:06.200 --> 03:56:10.760]  iran why do they want to yes because iran wants to
[03:56:10.760 --> 03:56:15.000]  get nuclear weapons of its own it says that if israel can have
[03:56:15.000 --> 03:56:18.840]  nuclear weapons and if india and pakistan can have them
[03:56:18.840 --> 03:56:22.520]  why not them but what they've been enriching and they even tried to send
[03:56:22.520 --> 03:56:25.560]  their iranian out of the country to prove they weren't that that this was
[03:56:25.560 --> 03:56:30.360]  non-nuclear uh but i mean you do think they do want to get nukes
[03:56:30.360 --> 03:56:35.320]  okay i don't think there's any i don't think that any doubt about it whatsoever
[03:56:35.320 --> 03:56:39.640]  i doubt it very much you know my book is told very widely
[03:56:39.640 --> 03:56:43.080]  the committee has been around the same situation
[03:56:43.080 --> 03:56:47.960]  but there it is and the people who i mean contest would tell me that
[03:56:47.960 --> 03:56:55.720]  they feel that war is very very imminent and they think that the story that
[03:56:55.720 --> 03:56:59.160]  is prevailing can prevent the nuclear
[03:56:59.160 --> 03:57:04.680]  armament of their rockets is uh going to be the focal point which will be the
[03:57:04.680 --> 03:57:08.680]  flashpoint that will start it well we have our sources inside
[03:57:08.680 --> 03:57:12.440]  bilberberg which of course is a subset of what you call the committee of 300
[03:57:12.440 --> 03:57:15.640]  and they for the first time according to jim tucker and others are green
[03:57:15.640 --> 03:57:19.160]  lighting an attack on iran now that doesn't mean it's a hundred percent
[03:57:19.160 --> 03:57:23.720]  but uh do you agree that having bilberberg sign off on it's a bad sign
[03:57:23.720 --> 03:57:28.520]  i think that anything they agree to is bad i doubt very much you know anything
[03:57:28.520 --> 03:57:31.000]  that the society has done about things
[03:57:31.000 --> 03:57:34.200]  they're not of an evidence in the town of bilberberg
[03:57:34.200 --> 03:57:38.120]  and holland and everything that's come out of this and nothing but the
[03:57:38.120 --> 03:57:43.720]  but the worst type of publications the world has ever seen so anything they
[03:57:43.720 --> 03:57:46.280]  approve i think is bad news for us
[03:57:46.280 --> 03:57:49.080]  all right dr john colman we look forward to speaking to you again in the
