[00:00.000 --> 00:07.680]  cover-ups. You want to ask him, he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live
[00:07.680 --> 00:10.720]  from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:19.600 --> 00:25.600]  Homeland Security visited Genesis two days ago. Ted was at a business meeting, the owner of the
[00:25.600 --> 00:33.280]  network. He finally was able to meet with Homeland Security yesterday and we will tell you what is
[00:33.280 --> 00:39.200]  going on after the first break that is coming up. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:39.200 --> 00:48.000]  we're big, we're having an effect and the enemies of the Republic, the security apparatus that the
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.600]  globalist have set up is there to protect the terrorists that carried out the terror attacks
[00:53.600 --> 01:00.160]  and is there to bring in a hardcore police state here in the United States. We have this from top,
[01:00.160 --> 01:06.000]  former CIA analyst, former head of the Treasury Department, we have this from White House historians,
[01:06.000 --> 01:13.040]  we have this from sociologists, we have this from political scientists, from very diverse
[01:13.040 --> 01:20.320]  backgrounds come on this radio show and tell you the same thing over and over again and it has
[01:20.320 --> 01:25.440]  nothing to do with George Bush or Barack Obama. They are complete puppets carrying this out.
[01:26.000 --> 01:32.560]  They are following orders to a T. Barack Obama has called for a new world order in Germany.
[01:32.560 --> 01:38.240]  Hitler, of course, second book was the New World Order, a pamphlet. Hitler in almost every speech
[01:38.240 --> 01:45.440]  called for a new world order. So much so that we've got Disney anti-Nazi cartoons aired in
[01:45.440 --> 01:51.760]  newsreels during World War II where it makes fun of Hitler with Daffy Duck in Germany with the Nazis
[01:52.320 --> 02:00.080]  stomping around singing New World Order. I mean, it's just unbelievable. Barack Obama goes to
[02:00.080 --> 02:06.320]  Germany, calls for a new world order and with a vicious look in his eye says that all Americans,
[02:06.320 --> 02:13.920]  all people of the world, must serve the new world order. This is just unbelievably evil. There is
[02:13.920 --> 02:20.000]  no doubt this was a written speech by design to let the world know he is for one world government
[02:20.000 --> 02:26.640]  and that don't worry elite. I'm New World Ordered. I'm Bilderberg. I'm going to continue the agenda
[02:26.640 --> 02:33.440]  and I'm going to fool all these schmucks and chumps and idiots that are watching me. These
[02:33.440 --> 02:38.960]  fools, you know, have no idea. I have fooled the black people. I have fooled the white liberals.
[02:38.960 --> 02:46.000]  They think because I'm half black that I'm somehow going to save people as if the New World Order a
[02:46.000 --> 02:50.880]  million times hasn't hired blacks to carry out all sorts of horrible operations in Africa
[02:50.880 --> 02:56.640]  and in the United States as if it matters what color he is. Now we are truly colorblind here
[02:56.640 --> 03:02.480]  and it shows how the quote left and many others are not. They are obsessed with color and because
[03:02.480 --> 03:11.680]  he's got some more melanin in his skin and is a light shade of chestnut brown, everything is just
[03:11.680 --> 03:19.040]  fine. Well, if having chestnut skin is good and is the only prerequisite you need, I can
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.320]  find you any number of rednecks who work out in the oil fields who've got darker skin than
[03:24.320 --> 03:30.320]  Barack Obama. It doesn't mean that they should be president. In fact, I can go out and bake in the
[03:30.320 --> 03:36.960]  sun for a month and get darker than Barack Obama. It means nothing, the melanin in his skin, nothing,
[03:37.600 --> 03:44.640]  nothing, nothing, nothing. The guy is total New World Order and is definitely their man
[03:44.640 --> 03:49.760]  with this speech. We are in a lot of trouble and I'm not saying vote for McCain. They give you
[03:49.760 --> 03:56.560]  false choices. You know, it's like you want to be shot in a firing squad by 30 odd six or 308.
[03:56.560 --> 04:01.840]  It doesn't matter when 20 bullets are going to be flying into your skin, whether it's 308 or 30
[04:01.840 --> 04:07.920]  odd six. You can debate which one of them is the 308 and which one is the 30 odd six. The 30 odd
[04:07.920 --> 04:13.280]  six, I guess, is a little more power, a little more punch to it. I guess one of them is going out
[04:13.280 --> 04:19.920]  the muzzle at, what, 1,300 feet per second? The other is going out at 1,400 feet per second,
[04:19.920 --> 04:24.960]  depending on the load. It makes no difference. No difference. It's still a high-powered rifle
[04:24.960 --> 04:30.720]  round. Folks, the news I've got is all off the charts. U.S. foreclosures double as house prices
[04:30.720 --> 04:38.240]  decline. GM in Florida, the verge of bankruptcy. Navy prosecutor in Gitmo case, fourth plane shot
[04:38.240 --> 04:44.800]  down. Government-required distance education spy cameras on Americans. Soy foods reduce sperm

[05:03.280 --> 05:08.160]  Loose change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family
[05:08.160 --> 05:13.040]  members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime
[05:13.040 --> 05:18.880]  are brought to justice. Loose change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose. From hijackers being

[05:50.160 --> 05:53.920]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[05:53.920 --> 05:58.640]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[05:58.640 --> 06:03.920]  I have run across a company called SFR who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[06:03.920 --> 06:08.880]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, protect a complete
[06:08.880 --> 06:15.200]  fuel system treatment, cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage and only one tank full.
[06:15.200 --> 06:20.000]  Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction, but it extends the life of your engine.
[06:20.000 --> 06:23.760]  Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[06:23.760 --> 06:29.120]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment,
[06:29.120 --> 06:37.600]  which is a $12.95 value free. Call 888-888-Use-SFR-1. That number again is 888-888-Use-SFR-1,
[06:37.600 --> 06:43.440]  or check them out online at OilCompanySecret.com. That's OilCompanySecret.com.

[07:13.440 --> 07:16.960]  I mean, the gasoline prices have gone insanely high, probably going to go higher.
[07:16.960 --> 07:20.880]  Grocery prices are right on their heels. How are people going to be able to afford to eat?
[07:20.880 --> 07:26.480]  Well, I found a way to buy really incredible foods like I just described at half the price of last
[07:26.480 --> 07:31.120]  year's grocery bill. For less than half of what you spent for the same amount of food last year,
[07:31.120 --> 07:37.360]  I can have it delivered to your door. Let me tell you how. Go to efoodsdirect.com right now.
[07:37.360 --> 07:48.960]  efoodsdirect.com or call the toll free number 800-409-5633. 800-409-5633. Cut those food costs now.
[07:54.320 --> 08:01.600]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[08:01.600 --> 08:17.200]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[08:22.720 --> 08:30.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. The House Issue Committee has been hearing a list of
[08:30.000 --> 08:37.600]  speakers worshiping George Bush, the deck stacked against Dennis Kasenich, and he has had his hands
[08:37.600 --> 08:43.040]  tied and has been told that he can't read any articles of impeachment or bring forward any of
[08:43.040 --> 08:49.440]  the charges. Just a on its face kangaroo court hearing, and that is what impeachment is,
[08:50.560 --> 08:55.680]  where they have the decision whether to indict or not in the house, in the full house,
[08:55.680 --> 09:02.240]  and they hear the charges. The House acts as the grand jury. If they bill the indictment,
[09:02.240 --> 09:08.800]  it goes to the Senate for the trial. But we're not to that point after years of manifest crimes,
[09:08.800 --> 09:14.080]  admissions by the White House. They've committed thousands of crimes just in the spying alone
[09:14.080 --> 09:21.200]  without warrants. Having to pass retroactive laws to protect themselves, there's no debating it.
[09:21.200 --> 09:30.720]  But Dennis Kasenich has valiantly fought to get a hearing, and then Conyers, who controls the
[09:30.720 --> 09:38.080]  committee suddenly at the last minute says, oh, by the way, you can't talk about about the president,
[09:38.080 --> 09:42.480]  you can't criticize him, you can't really discuss anything he's done, and you can't read any of
[09:42.480 --> 09:48.400]  your articles of impeachment. And then he says, and then the Senate says, can I just read one
[09:48.400 --> 09:53.680]  about lying about WMDs? And we have White House memos saying they were lying premeditatedly,
[09:53.680 --> 10:01.680]  and Conyers says, no, you can't even read that. You can't even read newspaper articles or White
[10:01.680 --> 10:06.960]  House documents in here. And so we will track that. We'll also open the phones because I haven't
[10:06.960 --> 10:10.480]  been able to watch hour after hour of it. I watched a little bit this morning. I've watched some
[10:10.480 --> 10:15.360]  clips online and YouTube clips of people cheering as Dennis Kasenich comes in, the people in the
[10:15.360 --> 10:20.720]  gallery. But we'll condense it all down and cover whatever is most important today. You listeners
[10:20.720 --> 10:24.480]  who have been watching and are listening to the audio feeds, you are welcome to call in at the
[10:24.480 --> 10:32.720]  bottom of the hour. In fact, you can get lined up now at 1-800-259-9231, specifically about the
[10:33.680 --> 10:38.240]  Judiciary Committee hearing that is ongoing and what you've witnessed and what you have seen
[10:38.240 --> 10:42.720]  there. I've got some of our writers that have been watching it this morning are going to do reports
[10:42.720 --> 10:48.720]  later in the afternoon on it. We'll also post all the news from other sources on infoawards.com
[10:48.720 --> 10:56.880]  and prisonplanet.com for you today. And in the next hour, next four hours, we will break all
[10:56.880 --> 11:01.920]  of the developments down for you. And as I said, take your phone calls. But I'm asking listeners
[11:01.920 --> 11:06.080]  to call in who've been watching the hearing specifically. I really don't want to open the
[11:06.080 --> 11:10.480]  phones up and have somebody tell me that I'm not a Christian because I speak out against
[11:10.480 --> 11:16.080]  the government. It's not of the Lord to do that. Or I don't want to open the phone up and hear from
[11:16.080 --> 11:22.960]  a caller asking why I don't talk about space aliens. I'm asking you listeners and I'm asking
[11:22.960 --> 11:29.760]  people to not call in and fill up the lines with BS, which is what folks do. See, we don't screen
[11:29.760 --> 11:35.040]  phone calls here. And so what happens is I occasionally say, I have a guest on say about
[11:35.040 --> 11:39.760]  the JFK murder assassination. I want you to call in about that if you have a question. Open the
[11:39.760 --> 11:48.400]  phone up and it's never on subject. Or I say, I want to get your take on Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,
[11:48.400 --> 11:52.880]  and their impending implosion. I want to hear your stories of what's happening with you and
[11:52.880 --> 11:58.000]  your house and your mortgage and your home value. And I can take 10 phone calls and maybe one person
[11:58.000 --> 12:04.480]  calls in to talk about that. Now, now 95% of the time when we take calls, I say it's a free for
[12:04.480 --> 12:09.120]  all, whatever you want to bring up, whatever subject you want to discuss. But in the few cases
[12:09.120 --> 12:14.000]  where I need intelligence, I need information, I need your help with things. Well, when I say,
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.600]  I want state police to call in and talk about, you know, are they getting federal training
[12:19.600 --> 12:23.920]  to go under martial law? And then I get state police emails saying, well, we tried to call
[12:23.920 --> 12:27.280]  in, your phones are busy. And then when I go to the calls, it's all about other subjects.
[12:27.280 --> 12:30.400]  So I'm going to tell listeners something. And I'm not mad at the general listeners,
[12:30.400 --> 12:36.880]  but for people that abuse the openness of the show, when I ask for specific
[12:36.880 --> 12:41.680]  people to be able to call in, I'm going to hang up on you if you bring up another subject,
[12:41.680 --> 12:46.480]  when I'm asking for specific information. So other people that have information on that can
[12:46.480 --> 12:54.880]  call in. Okay. I mean, it's just, it's gotten out of control completely and totally out of control.
[12:54.880 --> 13:01.120]  1-800-259-9231 coming up at the bottom of the hour for what you witnessed in the impeachment
[13:01.120 --> 13:05.280]  hearings. Okay. And then later we'll be able to codify and watch more of the videos. And
[13:05.280 --> 13:08.960]  I've got people watching and writing stories. But right now I want to hear from you what your
[13:08.960 --> 13:16.800]  response is, what your take is on this whitewash. This kangaroo rigged hearing of just biblical
[13:16.800 --> 13:24.160]  proportions. We are going to be talking to Ted Anderson and Anthony Yasha here in just a moment
[13:24.160 --> 13:28.960]  about Homeland Security visits to the network. Very serious issues there. But coming up,
[13:28.960 --> 13:36.720]  US foreclosures double as house prices decline. Ford and GM on the verge of bankruptcy. That's
[13:36.720 --> 13:40.960]  Bloomberg, folks. Okay. I mean, the president is telling you the economy is great and the
[13:40.960 --> 13:46.320]  two automakers are about to go under. Navy prosecutor in Gitmo case says fourth plane
[13:46.320 --> 13:51.200]  shot down. This is incredible. In testimony, you're saying the government shot the plane down.
[13:51.200 --> 13:55.760]  Now we already knew that. We already had Air Force colonels and generals on. We've already
[13:55.760 --> 14:01.120]  covered it and told you the name of the pilot who fired to aim nine sidewalkers into the aircraft
[14:01.120 --> 14:07.840]  flight 93 and recall conspiracy theorist. I mean, they had an award ceremony giving the pilot
[14:07.840 --> 14:13.040]  one of the highest Air Force medals for it because a general refused to follow orders
[14:13.040 --> 14:18.880]  to stand down and blew that aircraft out of the year. And it was going to go into the capital
[14:18.880 --> 14:24.400]  is what we're getting from the Air Force. In fact, that was the testimony. It was quote going
[14:24.400 --> 14:29.360]  into the capital dome, government decapitation. Some have said building seven in my film martial
[14:29.360 --> 14:33.600]  law off of our sources. I said the capital and we're being proven right in testimony.
[14:33.600 --> 14:38.160]  Rumsfeld slipped up three times and said they shot down flight 93. A bunch of other generals
[14:38.160 --> 14:45.600]  have an open testimony because everybody knows it. The military did its job and did not follow
[14:45.600 --> 14:51.040]  orders from Dick Cheney and blew that aircraft out of the air. And so they then concocted the
[14:51.040 --> 14:55.280]  Todd Beamer story of let's roll, knowing a bunch of saps would buy into it.
[14:59.280 --> 15:05.040]  Okay, and put out their little fake phone call from 35,000 feet, which they admit doesn't work.
[15:05.040 --> 15:10.800]  So we're going to cover that too. Huge news there. You better thank God the Air Force blew
[15:10.800 --> 15:14.880]  that aircraft out of the air and killed those people because they would have taken out the
[15:14.880 --> 15:23.200]  capital. We would have been in total martial law. Government to require
[15:25.360 --> 15:30.240]  distance education spy cameras. I told you this five years ago. They are going to have
[15:30.240 --> 15:33.680]  cameras watching you in all the schools when you take tests, not just distance learning.
[15:34.240 --> 15:41.040]  Soy foods reduce sperm counts, BBC. I told you this for many years. It absolutely fills you
[15:41.040 --> 15:51.920]  full of estrogen or estrogen mimicking plant hormones. And it is just very bad for you. So
[15:51.920 --> 15:58.160]  just get that straight. You want your boys to be super feminine and your daughters to be ultra
[15:58.160 --> 16:04.240]  feminine. And for the imbalance and estrogen to cause them to get breast cancer, just knock
[16:04.240 --> 16:10.080]  yourselves out. Don't listen to me. Don't say you weren't warned. Police resources are diverted
[16:10.080 --> 16:13.920]  from other problems to prevent terrorism. International Herald Tribune. And then they
[16:13.920 --> 16:20.320]  show pictures of riot cops. The message is protesting terrorism. ACLU obtains key memos,
[16:20.320 --> 16:26.240]  authorizing CIA torture methods. Wantonimo testimony. US let bin Laden's top bodyguard go.
[16:26.800 --> 16:30.240]  That's in road to tyranny, by the way. We told you that six and a half years ago.
[16:30.240 --> 16:36.800]  It is now in the Miami Herald today. They flew 6,000 El Cata commanders to safety.
[16:36.800 --> 16:43.040]  They're all CIA card carriers. Just it's unbelievable. The news I've got is all off the
[16:43.040 --> 16:51.280]  charts. Anthony Yasa called me, I guess, Tuesday, no, Wednesday begging for help.
[16:52.880 --> 16:58.880]  Anthony Yasa is a great We Are Changed fellow. A lot of the footage he shot and other shot
[16:58.880 --> 17:05.600]  is in Truth Rising. He talked about getting a job at Genesis. He's done freelance affiliate
[17:05.600 --> 17:10.560]  relations for us. Calling AM and FM folks to get more affiliates or to get affiliates to pick up
[17:10.560 --> 17:15.280]  more of the show or pick us up on the weekends. He's done that successfully. And he's worked
[17:15.280 --> 17:20.960]  in the office but as a freelancer contractor up in Minnesota. He has a no criminal record,
[17:20.960 --> 17:26.000]  great guy. Other We Are Changed people. They're some of the best We Are Changed. Very polite,
[17:26.000 --> 17:29.280]  very eloquent. You've seen them all over the news talking to McCain. It's made national
[17:29.280 --> 17:33.840]  attention several times. They also went to press conferences. Jesse Ventura wouldn't talk to anybody,
[17:33.840 --> 17:37.200]  but them because he knows who We Are Changed are and his fans.
[17:40.160 --> 17:45.920]  Just they are, even when they're being grabbed on, they go with Genesis Press Passes, a network
[17:45.920 --> 17:50.240]  with hundreds of AM and FM affiliates. One of the largest independent networks in the world.
[17:51.680 --> 17:58.320]  He has an info wars press pass. We sent him the template and then had him laminate it.
[17:58.320 --> 18:06.960]  And they arrested him saying he had fake documents a few weeks ago and he didn't want to make a big
[18:06.960 --> 18:10.080]  deal about it at the time. He wanted to make sure that they dropped it and left him alone.
[18:10.720 --> 18:14.800]  Then Homeland Security tried to show up at the show at the office two days ago. Ted was gone
[18:14.800 --> 18:19.200]  in a business meeting. They said they come back. They paranoidly called to Justin and said,
[18:19.200 --> 18:22.960]  meet me at a restaurant. I don't want to come there. Then he said, you know, why do you guys
[18:22.960 --> 18:26.960]  think 9-11 is an inside job? So they admitted it was about political harassment. Said to Ted,
[18:26.960 --> 18:30.720]  why do you guys, you know, why is this Anthony guy thinking 9-11 is an inside job? So they're
[18:30.720 --> 18:34.880]  there saying, why do you think it's an inside job? And saying, we know these are fake documents
[18:34.880 --> 18:40.160]  that he didn't have real press passes. And Ted said, no, I told him, you know, he has a press
[18:40.160 --> 18:46.800]  pass from us. We want him to go report for us. He's been talking to Governor Ventura as well.
[18:48.080 --> 18:53.600]  I mean, if you must know about doing a show on Genesis. So all of this is going on. All of this
[18:53.600 --> 18:58.880]  is happening. And the guy was, it was, it was, was getting in Ted's words on the phone with me
[18:58.880 --> 19:04.880]  last night. Ted called me at about 1130 when I was here at work, pissy is the word. Getting pissy
[19:04.880 --> 19:09.440]  with Ted at a restaurant over coffee saying, no, it's a fake. It's a fake document. We want to
[19:09.440 --> 19:15.360]  charge him with manufacturing fake press passes. Well, I mean, he can, they happen to have a website
[19:15.360 --> 19:18.800]  that gets hundreds of thousands of hits a month that he wanted to make up a press pass. They said,
[19:18.800 --> 19:22.960]  as we are changed was fake. They have a website. They make the news. They have info or press passes.
[19:22.960 --> 19:28.480]  They have Genesis press passes. They're real. And I've had Secret Service here. I'm sick of them
[19:28.480 --> 19:33.840]  coming to my office. We've got them up at Genesis. They are upset that we are affecting change,
[19:33.840 --> 19:37.840]  that we are asking real questions at press conferences. And this is an attempt to attack
[19:37.840 --> 19:42.880]  the First Amendment and intimidate free speech with a chilling effect. And the Secret Service is
[19:42.880 --> 19:50.560]  going to get sued if they don't leave us alone real fast. And I mean, personally, on the average,
[19:50.560 --> 19:55.360]  Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out
[19:55.360 --> 20:00.880]  their golden years. Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and
[20:00.880 --> 20:06.160]  medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line. Is this a flaw for the enterprise
[20:06.160 --> 20:10.560]  or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve note forcing us into perpetual debt,
[20:10.560 --> 20:14.960]  ensuring inflation and higher taxes? These questions and more can be answered by reading
[20:14.960 --> 20:19.520]  G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island. Congressman Ron Paul states,
[20:19.520 --> 20:24.480]  it's what every American needs to know about central bank power, a gripping adventure into the
[20:24.480 --> 20:29.360]  secret world of international banking cartel. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. I will give a silver
[20:29.360 --> 20:36.400]  dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book. Call 1-800-686-2237 and

[20:51.360 --> 20:57.680]  I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[20:57.680 --> 21:01.520]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order? How do the American people know that 9-11
[21:01.520 --> 21:06.000]  was a stage? Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the fallout or commission to see
[21:06.000 --> 21:13.120]  farm? The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of
[21:13.120 --> 21:18.560]  despotism to grow at our own door. Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[21:18.560 --> 21:29.120]  a global awakening is taking place. An inside job. How dare you? If you know that there's
[21:29.120 --> 21:33.680]  treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself. All hell is breaking loose on
[21:33.680 --> 21:38.880]  6th Avenue. And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th
[21:38.880 --> 21:44.720]  anniversary of 9-11. Please rise. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD

[21:49.920 --> 21:54.720]  that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant
[21:54.720 --> 22:00.240]  health? Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[22:00.240 --> 22:06.080]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements. This product
[22:06.080 --> 22:12.400]  is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness. Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to
[22:12.400 --> 22:17.840]  make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[22:17.840 --> 22:23.600]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[22:23.600 --> 22:28.480]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen
[22:28.480 --> 22:34.160]  content of your body. Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline
[22:34.160 --> 22:40.640]  environment. Order your bottle of Alkavision Plasma pH drops now by going directly to Alkavision.com.

[22:51.680 --> 22:56.960]  easy way we can steal people's credit cards without even knowing they've been robbed. How so Clyde? I
[22:56.960 --> 23:02.320]  have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet just by waving it near you. I can skin your credit
[23:02.320 --> 23:07.120]  card information while your cards are still in your purse. Just watch. Hey look that's my info
[23:07.120 --> 23:12.560]  on the screen. You gotta be kidding me. Nope. With 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips,
[23:12.560 --> 23:17.280]  I figure we'll make a fortune. As long as people don't hear about identity stronghold. Why? What's
[23:17.280 --> 23:22.400]  identity stronghold? They make the secure sleeve. When people keep their credit cards in the shield
[23:22.400 --> 23:28.000]  at secure sleeve, I can't read them. Do a lot of people already know about the secure sleeve? No way.
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.480]  Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports. Clyde, we should
[23:32.480 --> 23:37.280]  get some of those secure sleeves. I already got some. I also got some to fit our passports.
[23:37.280 --> 23:42.240]  Identity stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at idstronghold.com.
[23:42.240 --> 23:48.400]  idstronghold.com. Right. Or you can call them at 1-800-610-2770.
[23:52.480 --> 23:58.560]  The preacher man says it's the end of time and the Mississippi River she's a gold grime.
[23:58.560 --> 24:03.760]  This Secret Service agent's comments to Ted over coffee.
[24:10.320 --> 24:13.120]  That why would anybody believe 9-11's an inside job?
[24:18.240 --> 24:22.800]  Makes the connection for the fact that this is political.
[24:22.800 --> 24:32.000]  We have the White House memos going back five years ago that have been all over the news where
[24:32.720 --> 24:36.560]  they tell the Secret Service to go out and recruit local police to violate people's first
[24:36.560 --> 24:41.360]  amendment and arrest them for peaceful demonstrations and to put them quote in free speech areas
[24:41.360 --> 24:46.560]  where the press cannot see them. And they say it's not for security. It is so that the cameras
[24:46.560 --> 24:53.040]  don't see them for political effect. You're caught red-handed and you become a secret police
[24:53.040 --> 24:59.520]  intimidation force when you start going around trying to stop VR change which has gone and
[24:59.520 --> 25:06.720]  protested live TV events on the city streets of New York. I was arrested for that which has made
[25:06.720 --> 25:12.800]  the news hundreds of times peacefully and has done nothing violent but been assaulted. We have
[25:12.800 --> 25:18.800]  police on video coming up and saying cameras are guns that we have bombs saying we know you don't
[25:18.800 --> 25:23.040]  have bombs but we're going to say you have bombs. That's the whole point of truth rising ladies and
[25:23.040 --> 25:28.160]  gentlemen. You know what it's like having the Secret Service at our office here twice. You know
[25:28.160 --> 25:32.800]  it's like Ted having Secret Service come out twice. You know what it's like for Anthony
[25:32.800 --> 25:37.920]  Johnson to get arrested and saying he has fake press passes and now they want us to lie and say
[25:37.920 --> 25:43.680]  that we didn't give him press passes. We're not going to do it. Now I want to go to Ted Anderson.
[25:43.680 --> 25:48.560]  We got Anthony Yasa waiting in the wings there who's just one of the best people out there asking
[25:48.560 --> 25:56.560]  questions eloquently politely at press conferences in America for this network. Ted this is getting
[25:56.560 --> 26:00.320]  serious and I know you're a calm guy on the air but you were a little bit mad last night when you
[26:00.320 --> 26:04.480]  talked to me and I like seeing that backbone. You said that you're getting sick of this.
[26:04.480 --> 26:09.520]  Oh there's no question about it Alex. I mean here what they're trying to do is they're trying
[26:09.520 --> 26:15.120]  to pick on Anthony here. He's a complete peaceful you know asking questions. I guess you can't ask
[26:15.120 --> 26:22.080]  questions about 9-11 at a news conference for John McCain. Otherwise you can expect to have
[26:22.080 --> 26:27.040]  visits from the Secret Service. From what I understand not only have they confronted Anthony
[26:27.040 --> 26:32.640]  Yasa they've been talking to his fiance girlfriend wife. I don't know what the relationship is.
[26:32.640 --> 26:37.120]  It's his fiance. When he's at work they come to her and say so you're planning violence.
[26:37.120 --> 26:41.840]  Let us in your computers right now without warrants trying to intimidate their way in on a woman.
[26:41.840 --> 26:48.000]  I can tell you right now I know no violent nothing. I've never seen that in Anthony at all.
[26:48.800 --> 26:54.320]  I don't think he has any intentions to. Of course not. They know that. They know that. They're there
[26:54.320 --> 26:58.720]  to try to scare everybody from going out and asking questions to John McCain when it makes
[26:58.720 --> 27:02.560]  with on four or five networks. Well that's the thing. What they're trying to pin on him right
[27:02.560 --> 27:07.760]  now is that he had false documents but he doesn't have false documents. The guy's trying to think
[27:07.760 --> 27:11.520]  you know he's thinking that I'm trying to cover for him. That he made these documents and I'm
[27:11.520 --> 27:17.120]  saying I gave him permission. I gave him permission long before. We've had Anthony on five times on
[27:17.120 --> 27:23.360]  this show reporting as an info wars genesis reporter. Yeah that's the whole thing. He had his own
[27:23.360 --> 27:30.400]  cubicle at the office. It's ridiculous. You tell him that. You know you pay him. Okay he goes out
[27:30.400 --> 27:36.480]  and he does work for us. That's the whole point about it Alex. I mean they're trying to they're
[27:36.480 --> 27:39.600]  trying to pin and they're trying to pin this all on them. What they're trying to do is they're
[27:39.600 --> 27:44.240]  trying to probably make them into a scapegoat or something. And what it is is that I don't have
[27:44.240 --> 27:48.320]  Ryan Slick eyes and working for me full time who would make these beautiful press passes.
[27:48.320 --> 27:52.240]  And so we just send the template out and say laminate it yourself with their name and picture
[27:52.240 --> 27:58.000]  on it and that's how the press works. It doesn't matter. He's here reporting. He comes and says
[27:58.000 --> 28:02.880]  I'm pressed from We Are Change. They say that's a fake press pass when it's his website and his
[28:02.880 --> 28:08.480]  news group. I mean we're allowed as Americans to go to events and ask questions. This is insane.
[28:08.480 --> 28:13.600]  Oh these are open public events for McCain. I mean anybody could show up and say their press
[28:13.600 --> 28:20.320]  and ask questions. Well and Dan Thiel with the Secret Service, the guy that met with me,
[28:20.320 --> 28:25.440]  was saying that we don't have the right to do that. That we don't have a right to create a pass
[28:25.440 --> 28:31.120]  and end up on a podium with the press. And the fact of the matter is and I asked him straight
[28:31.120 --> 28:36.640]  up I said what is the press? I've got 200 AM and FM stations that pick up our stuff here
[28:37.520 --> 28:42.720]  and play it on air. We are the press. I mean what do you have to have a newspaper? Maybe
[28:42.720 --> 28:47.680]  you have to have a membership with the CIA or something. No, no. There's only a few places.
[28:47.680 --> 28:55.200]  They have congressional press passes issued by Congress for the Capitol Building to get into
[28:55.200 --> 29:00.800]  committee meetings. And they know that it's all color of law. They think we're stupid. They're
[29:00.800 --> 29:05.840]  scared of the American people becoming the press. That's why they want to shut down the web. That
[29:05.840 --> 29:10.320]  is exactly what they're doing. And so the Secret Service is now telling Ted Anderson you don't
[29:10.320 --> 29:16.400]  have a right to send reporters to events. This is outrageous. Stay there Ted. I want to bring in
[29:16.400 --> 29:22.320]  Anthony Dasha on the other side. This is the battle for the Republic ladies and gentlemen.
[29:22.320 --> 29:27.200]  We're trying to send reporters. We ought to pull up some of the YouTube clips of We Are Change
[29:27.200 --> 29:32.400]  Minnesota asking questions. These are the people that have just been doing such a great job
[29:32.400 --> 29:36.240]  and the Secret Service wants it to stop. They don't want questions to Bill Clinton or Hillary
[29:36.240 --> 29:45.440]  or Barack Obama or to John McCain. We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the
[29:45.440 --> 29:53.760]  GCN radio network. Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying
[29:53.760 --> 29:58.640]  national sovereignty worldwide. But in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope. The first time in
[29:58.640 --> 30:03.280]  modern history the people are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide
[30:03.280 --> 30:07.440]  accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan. We have a short
[30:07.440 --> 30:12.160]  time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat. In the Info War,

[33:26.480 --> 33:31.120]  Barack Obama who's called for world government. That is coming up. We've also got the Senate
[33:31.120 --> 33:37.680]  valiantly fighting against the tyranny. We're going to be taking your calls at 1-800-25-99231
[33:37.680 --> 33:40.720]  coming up and what you've been witnessing with the impeachment hearings going for the last four
[33:40.720 --> 33:46.640]  hours, last three and a half hours if you want to be technical. I just want to be clear that when
[33:46.640 --> 33:53.840]  George Bush and there was that whole two month long election fight in 2000 with Al Gore, I would
[33:53.840 --> 34:00.080]  try to peacefully go down and videotape the governor's mansion with hundreds of reporters and scores
[34:00.080 --> 34:06.160]  of news agencies, hundreds of newspapers. They had pro Gore, pro Bush people running around
[34:07.280 --> 34:11.520]  hitting each other with signs. The Secret Service would ignore that. The Secret Service guys were
[34:11.520 --> 34:17.120]  dressed up kind of in gang member outfits. It's these disguises were unbelievable. You'd have
[34:17.120 --> 34:24.320]  like a 45, 50 year old gray haired white guy with big bling Mercedes Ben Gold chains
[34:25.040 --> 34:27.920]  bling hanging around his neck and they'd come up and shove me and say,
[34:27.920 --> 34:31.680]  where are you parked Alex? What are you doing Alex? I need to get out of here Alex. We don't
[34:31.680 --> 34:35.760]  like it being here Alex and they look just like a criminal out of a movie or a gangster and I'd be
[34:35.760 --> 34:40.560]  like I'm here videotaping what's going on and covering this and you need to stop it and then
[34:40.560 --> 34:44.800]  oh I turn around they bump into me oh sorry I bumped into you oh you're gonna do something
[34:44.800 --> 34:49.520]  you know I'll never forget that one little guy he was about five foot two and there were other
[34:49.520 --> 34:54.560]  people's folks that were definitely special ops and I'd say oh now we got Navy SEALs out here and
[34:54.560 --> 34:59.760]  they'd laugh and go hi Jones you know those guys walking around were a little more professional
[34:59.760 --> 35:05.280]  than the uh and they're playing close in the Secret Service following us to our car so I said
[35:05.280 --> 35:10.480]  that's it I'm coming back with a bullhorn came out with a bullhorn ABC News cameraman
[35:10.480 --> 35:14.480]  runs across the street punches me in the throat state police run over and say yes we saw him
[35:14.480 --> 35:19.200]  hit you but we're gonna arrest you if you do anything back and I was just like you people
[35:19.200 --> 35:23.680]  are unbelievable I'm the bad one because I'm the good guy I'm the guy defending America
[35:23.680 --> 35:27.280]  I'm the guy that knows what's going on we're the people that understand what's happening
[35:28.000 --> 35:33.200]  now we've had Secret Service out here twice and now every day on YouTube I see threats to the
[35:33.200 --> 35:37.040]  president threats to this and that they never get investigated never stop it's just all over the
[35:37.040 --> 35:41.280]  web now I'm gonna do this to Obama we're gonna do this to Bush we're gonna just everybody threat
[35:41.280 --> 35:44.800]  threat threat threat threat threat you know uh with these anonymous people saying I'm gonna
[35:44.800 --> 35:50.240]  do this and I'm gonna do that nothing happens but we we've had these little uh uh provocateurs
[35:50.240 --> 35:56.240]  go on our message boards and try to do it uh you know again trying to cause us problems
[35:56.240 --> 36:01.280]  and then we've got the same IP addresses we can go look uh then tattling on themselves
[36:01.280 --> 36:05.120]  above it and pointing it out look they're calling for violence and it's the same IP address
[36:06.800 --> 36:12.160]  so they know that we are changed as peaceful they know that Anthony Yash is peaceful they know
[36:12.160 --> 36:17.440]  what's going on and they're now telling Ted Anderson this is the key why do you guys think
[36:17.440 --> 36:22.160]  9-11's an inside job why do your reporters think that that's that's weird that's and by the way
[36:22.160 --> 36:27.200]  you can't issue people press passes well I mean what do you think it is when it's a local Minnesota
[36:27.200 --> 36:32.880]  paper a local TV station or a local blogger they come and then you just get accredited
[36:32.880 --> 36:37.520]  to to to to get in you call the event that John mccain's going to be at in two days or Barack
[36:37.520 --> 36:42.400]  Obama and you say yeah I want to be at that town hall meeting in the press box and they say okay
[36:42.400 --> 36:46.400]  well we're already full up or you can be in the outside press box and you know okay and they give
[36:46.400 --> 36:53.440]  you a press pass okay uh and that's how that works or if it's a public event you can just go in and
[36:53.440 --> 36:57.120]  go get in the press area I can tell you how many times when governor Bush was governor I'd go to
[36:57.120 --> 37:00.640]  one of his press conferences and he's there to give a speech and you just show up and walk right
[37:00.640 --> 37:05.440]  in nobody stops you they're open to the event now at the depot photo masking plant when I asked him
[37:05.440 --> 37:11.200]  a peaceful question about the Federal Reserve destroying America with a fiat currency in 1998
[37:11.200 --> 37:16.640]  they had me kidnapped for an hour they it's all in video grab in fact John I've sent you that audio
[37:16.640 --> 37:24.000]  let's play that coming up and and and they grabbed me almost you know dislocated my shoulder I still
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.080]  roll over in the middle of the night sometimes they have just incredible spasms of pain into my
[37:28.080 --> 37:33.120]  shoulder from the Williamson County constables and the state police protective services almost
[37:33.120 --> 37:38.080]  ripping my arm out of the socket putting my fist all the way up behind my back to the center top
[37:38.080 --> 37:42.640]  of my back and and they're going you're going down boy trap him up against the wall and shoving
[37:42.640 --> 37:48.480]  my head into the glass and giggling about it attacking free speech attacking America and I
[37:48.480 --> 37:55.360]  have had enough of it we will ask our questions we will go to press conferences and we're on two
[37:55.360 --> 37:59.760]  affiliates that are in Chicago one's outside Chicago one's in Chicago the rear of the show at
[37:59.760 --> 38:04.960]  night in the morning we're on in Kansas City we're on in Niagara Falls we're on in Rochester
[38:04.960 --> 38:12.480]  we're on outside Tampa we're on in Austin Texas we're on on 590 we're on uh 1330 in Taylor right
[38:12.480 --> 38:18.640]  here in Austin we're on KCA in San Diego we're on affiliates in Montana we're in affiliates in
[38:18.640 --> 38:26.640]  Utah we're on affiliates just all Tennessee WBCR Knoxville all over the place I have the number
[38:26.640 --> 38:32.640]  one show on the internet for radio not just AM and FM international shortwave satellites
[38:32.640 --> 38:39.600]  uh we lease an ABC star guide feed feeding the stations all of this is media as it gets
[38:42.080 --> 38:45.760]  I'm a guest on national television shows the biggest radio shows in the country
[38:45.760 --> 38:50.480]  I have reporters and the Secret Service just says to the guy that is the owner of the network
[38:50.480 --> 38:56.400]  that that that that syndicates my radio show saying you aren't allowed Mr. Anderson and by
[38:56.400 --> 39:03.520]  extension Alex Jones to have a press pass you're not allowed to send reporters that is illegal
[39:04.640 --> 39:09.360]  that is against the law Ted exactly what did the Secret Service man say and then I want to go to
[39:09.360 --> 39:13.760]  Anthony Asher what did he say about you're not allowed to issue press passes to him
[39:13.760 --> 39:17.040]  I don't know what he what he is what he is really alluding to is he's alluding to the
[39:17.040 --> 39:24.080]  fact that Anthony Jesser had made these press passes without consent from Genesis Communications
[39:24.080 --> 39:29.040]  Network and I said that's not true Anthony Jesser had permission personally for me to
[39:29.040 --> 39:33.120]  have a press press from Genesis Communications Network what they're trying to do is they're
[39:33.120 --> 39:40.160]  trying to pin on Anthony that he had falsified documents and uh and and and to me I mean
[39:40.160 --> 39:45.440]  it the the bottom line is is that they they don't want us there they don't want us asking
[39:45.440 --> 39:51.440]  questions and to me the whole point is hey if you could ask about 9 11 over at a press conference
[39:51.440 --> 39:55.520]  when you have John McCain there perhaps even Barack Obama you're going to have the Secret
[39:55.520 --> 39:59.120]  Service all over you and you might as well be ready for that but I also told the Secret
[39:59.120 --> 40:02.640]  Service guys had you know whatever you do to Anthony don't think that's going to make it
[40:02.640 --> 40:07.520]  stop because these guys are all over the United States they're everywhere they will be at these
[40:07.520 --> 40:13.120]  press conferences and they'll be asking these questions and they should be and you know we
[40:13.120 --> 40:20.640]  have Jesse Ventura and all these other uh uh you know mainstream high uh uh profile people
[40:20.640 --> 40:24.000]  that are asking the same questions I don't think they can get away from we have German
[40:24.000 --> 40:28.160]  defense ministers great point that we have German defense ministers former Italian presidents
[40:28.160 --> 40:33.520]  former CIA section chief Berlin Bill Christensen former top the CIA briefer Ronald Reagan George
[40:33.520 --> 40:39.840]  Bush senior Ray McGovern uh uh Mr. Baer Bob Baer the uh individual that Siriana's made about one
[40:39.840 --> 40:44.560]  of the most famous living CIA commanders field commanders saying inside job on this show are
[40:44.560 --> 40:50.240]  they going to get Secret Service visits uh here's another one uh here is the Miami Herald
[40:50.240 --> 40:55.360]  Guantanamo testimony U.S. let bin Laden's top bodyguard go and they go on to say that they
[40:55.360 --> 41:01.840]  grab 12 and 14 year old uh villagers and keep them for six years but that when they got bin
[41:01.840 --> 41:07.520]  Laden's top bodyguard they immediately let him go quietly that's because they're CIA and then the
[41:07.520 --> 41:12.800]  troops this has been in mainstream news keep keep kept capturing real Taliban al Qaeda and in fact
[41:12.800 --> 41:18.640]  the troops had captured 6,000 of them during the invasion in 2001 2002 they were ordered to release
[41:18.640 --> 41:22.880]  them and even give them money give them gold and that came out in mainstream news that's in my
[41:22.880 --> 41:28.800]  film road to tyranny six and a half plus years old the first major 9-11 film and it's all mainstream
[41:28.800 --> 41:35.520]  news but back of the paper that they're protecting al Qaeda and I have another report here info wars
[41:35.520 --> 41:41.840]  dot net but it's from Reuters we point out Reuters this is from Reuters Navy prosecutor and Gitmo
[41:41.840 --> 41:48.240]  case fourth plane shot down bin Laden driver case contains revealing details through the
[41:48.240 --> 41:53.040]  trial the man dubbed it's only bin Laden's driver when they released his real protector CIA
[41:53.040 --> 41:57.680]  protector officer as primarily functioning as a showpiece for bush administration one on terror
[41:57.680 --> 42:01.680]  some interesting information emerged from the guantanamo bay naval base yesterday
[42:01.680 --> 42:05.920]  in the form of a directed mission from the u.s prosecutor that the fourth plane was shot down
[42:05.920 --> 42:10.720]  the revolution came during assertions from representatives for the prosecution that salim
[42:10.720 --> 42:18.640]  amadi amadin had detailed knowledge of the intended target of the fourth hijack plane on 9-11
[42:18.640 --> 42:22.400]  and it quoted they hadn't shot down the fourth plane it would have hit the dome of the capital
[42:22.400 --> 42:28.000]  stone a navy officer said in the opening remarks and we'll cover this more later the point is cops
[42:28.000 --> 42:33.520]  military secret service don't go demand ted anderson come meet you at a coffee shop because
[42:33.520 --> 42:39.040]  you're quote afraid we're going to surveil you and then tell us we're crazy about 9-11 when we
[42:39.040 --> 42:43.280]  know how to read newspapers buddy when we know how to interview norman menetta that's what we are
[42:43.280 --> 42:47.520]  changed when did saying no dick chaney's lying i was in the bunker with him as the whole hijacking
[42:47.520 --> 42:52.080]  thing started chaney tried to lie and say he got there later you know i mean we're going to keep
[42:52.080 --> 42:56.960]  bringing this out okay you may think it's cute and funny the government killed 3 000 of us but we
[42:56.960 --> 43:01.520]  don't think it's funny we have to have the courage and the will to come out and expose this well
[43:01.520 --> 43:06.720]  that that's another thing too alex is that uh... the normal everyday people including the secret
[43:06.720 --> 43:11.120]  service people are you know that that they don't you know they don't want to take the idea of the
[43:11.120 --> 43:16.480]  fact that there could be a uh... conspiracy if you will use those words obviously as a conspiracy
[43:16.480 --> 43:21.520]  with these airplanes flying into the world trade center and that it might not be some guy from
[43:21.520 --> 43:27.280]  a cave that ran this whole thing and made the whole operation occur um... you know i i i asked
[43:27.280 --> 43:32.080]  the guy myself i said well explain to me how two towers got hit by airplanes and three ended up
[43:32.080 --> 43:36.880]  falling and why did they look like controlled demolitions and he said i don't know you know he
[43:36.880 --> 43:41.280]  didn't have an answer and why did a secret service agent go investigate and got kept in the head
[43:41.280 --> 43:45.920]  inside building sevens the info we've got i mean i didn't even know a secret service guy died in
[43:45.920 --> 43:51.360]  there i didn't know the head of fb i counterterrorism who just retired saying telling the british
[43:51.360 --> 43:56.160]  newspapers the government is going to let bin latin yet probably the world trade center in the
[43:56.160 --> 44:02.480]  next few months as a pretext to invade afghanistan launch a war on terror john o'neill oh you didn't
[44:02.480 --> 44:09.120]  know about that secret service well why don't you use your investigative skills to investigate the
[44:09.120 --> 44:13.920]  truth why don't you find out the truth that you were based in that building of the cia
[44:14.560 --> 44:21.760]  okay well let's bring uh... anthony uh... anthony uh... this is incredible tell folks about what
[44:21.760 --> 44:28.720]  happened uh... with them now visiting your uh... fiance when you were at work and and now they're
[44:28.720 --> 44:33.040]  saying that that uh... telling your girlfriend that they think you're that that we are changes
[44:33.040 --> 44:39.280]  planning to try to attack barack obama when we've written articles talking about that out of the
[44:39.280 --> 44:44.080]  dallas morning news first reported that the secret services pulling protection off of him
[44:44.080 --> 44:50.000]  and not looking for guns when people go into events with him so they're the ones that are
[44:50.000 --> 44:54.400]  uh... leaving the door open like they did in dallas forty four years ago uh... anthony uh...
[44:54.400 --> 44:56.800]  this is insane
[44:56.800 --> 45:02.000]  oh it's it's really it's getting it's thickening to the point where i mean
[45:02.000 --> 45:06.240]  but they show up and if they're right i don't know if they planned on
[45:06.240 --> 45:11.280]  making sure they showed up when i was gone but if you're seeing that way just
[45:11.280 --> 45:13.680]  how they put there and try to
[45:13.680 --> 45:16.480]  it's like a limbo like they're
[45:16.480 --> 45:20.960]  playing stupid but they know something but i mean i guess my biggest question i
[45:20.960 --> 45:23.520]  mean these guys do take an oath to
[45:23.520 --> 45:27.200]  uh... hold the constitution do they not i mean if they're an intelligence agency
[45:27.200 --> 45:31.840]  and that they can sit there and ask people like ted and stuff why we would think nine
[45:31.840 --> 45:35.600]  eleven was an inside job and waste all these state resources
[45:35.600 --> 45:42.240]  driving from my house to genesis to jamie's house up north and maple groves and
[45:42.240 --> 45:46.560]  just i mean consider looking at the definition of terrorism by webster that's
[45:46.560 --> 45:52.080]  the systematic use of violence terror and intimidation to achieve an end and
[45:52.080 --> 45:56.240]  that's exactly what i see i mean i don't scare very easily and just what they've
[45:56.240 --> 45:59.680]  been pulling since the mccain event it's just
[45:59.680 --> 46:03.200]  i say i mean i feel like they're running around in the shadows
[46:03.200 --> 46:06.240]  plotting and planning well they've got to protect the terrorists that carried out
[46:06.240 --> 46:08.800]  the attack that's the most important thing for the criminals that run our
[46:08.800 --> 46:11.600]  government and you've got a lot of useful idiots these guys probably
[46:11.600 --> 46:13.360]  even believe what they're saying and
[46:13.360 --> 46:17.440]  drunk in the koolag like hitler's ss his secret service
[46:17.440 --> 46:22.160]  uh... but expanding on this and their new role is the new gestapo
[46:22.160 --> 46:25.040]  uh... in america the front line of that whether they like it or not that's just
[46:25.040 --> 46:28.080]  the fact they've engaged in intimidation attacks on the first amendment
[46:28.080 --> 46:31.040]  high crimes and misdemeanors uh... the entire agency has
[46:31.040 --> 46:34.240]  we have their own memos where they are there to stop free speech
[46:34.240 --> 46:38.080]  they don't want cameras on protesters now to be specific they kind of force their
[46:38.080 --> 46:41.040]  way in on your girlfriend and then so let us search your computers
[46:41.040 --> 46:43.920]  you know why are you planning to go after barack obama
[46:43.920 --> 46:46.880]  to try to put words in her mouth to tell folks what they were doing
[46:46.880 --> 46:50.160]  yeah like i said i mean when they first showed up here my
[46:50.160 --> 46:53.840]  my fiance was upstairs we live in a split house and um...
[46:53.840 --> 46:57.280]  they actually ran into our landlord downstairs and they were i mean
[46:57.280 --> 47:00.640]  she's a pretty smart girl she can see a salesman or whatever you want to call
[47:00.640 --> 47:04.560]  him a mile away and they were trying to
[47:04.560 --> 47:09.200]  basically slick talk her into giving them permission to just come in the
[47:09.200 --> 47:12.000]  house and she's like well if you don't you can go in if
[47:12.000 --> 47:15.360]  you got a warrant and if you don't you can't and
[47:15.360 --> 47:19.120]  you can ring the doorbell though and she comes down and they just play polite
[47:19.120 --> 47:23.360]  and i mean like say like the colombo where they're
[47:23.360 --> 47:26.320]  acting like they don't really know what's going on but they do
[47:26.320 --> 47:30.880]  supposedly and they came up in the living room there was one
[47:30.880 --> 47:33.920]  i'm not sure the name because i wasn't here we only caught the last name and
[47:33.920 --> 47:36.800]  i believe that it's the same one that called ted
[47:36.800 --> 47:41.440]  and got into our living room basically and then it was like well where do you
[47:41.440 --> 47:45.600]  keep your computers are you guys gonna are you guys planning on harming
[47:45.600 --> 47:50.560]  barack obama and i mean if you guys are supposedly the investigators
[47:50.560 --> 47:56.160]  and your top natural security supposedly you would know
[47:56.160 --> 47:59.600]  that we are no threat it would take five to ten minutes of research just
[47:59.600 --> 48:02.800]  but you are a threat through your political speech under the first
[48:02.800 --> 48:07.520]  amendment america and freedom is the threat to their tyranny
[48:07.520 --> 48:13.120]  exactly we are i mean exposing what's going on and people
[48:13.120 --> 48:17.120]  they're writing around this country and even other countries now
[48:17.120 --> 48:19.440]  protecting and yeah i need curtain memo or steve
[48:19.440 --> 48:22.080]  watson or somebody to put an article together i just saw him again in the
[48:22.080 --> 48:24.960]  news last week with those white house memos to the secret
[48:24.960 --> 48:30.480]  service saying you know use local police uh have them intimidate and
[48:30.480 --> 48:33.360]  violate people's rights stop them from having their speech
[48:33.360 --> 48:36.240]  stuff stop them from being able to be in front of news cameras
[48:36.240 --> 48:40.960]  i mean it's all about political aim they know you're no threat anthony
[48:40.960 --> 48:44.720]  now they're trying to set you up on false documents
[48:44.720 --> 48:48.800]  uh do not talk to them they will lie and say that you gave false statements to a
[48:48.800 --> 48:53.600]  federal officer their favorite Byzantine uh false law of imprisoning people
[48:53.600 --> 48:57.040]  and from this point on if they show up at my office i'm not talking to them
[48:57.040 --> 49:00.320]  uh because you know they show up and say we want the ip address of this person
[49:00.320 --> 49:03.440]  making a threat i've said okay i'll email it to you because you know
[49:03.440 --> 49:06.480]  obviously we don't want their own goons on our websites doing that
[49:06.480 --> 49:11.280]  uh but uh from this point on i am not i'm gonna tell them listen your comrades
[49:11.280 --> 49:15.280]  are engaging in violations of the first amendment serious

[55:42.480 --> 55:46.960]  a minute so we're changed and he just got the hunch to call
[55:46.960 --> 55:49.760]  our other guy james was involved at the town hall
[55:49.760 --> 55:54.000]  the meeting and um pretty much by the time you'd given him a call literally
[55:54.000 --> 55:57.440]  when he got off the phone saying i guess anthony just got
[55:57.440 --> 56:01.280]  or anthony's girlfriend got visited by secret service they showed up at his
[56:01.280 --> 56:04.000]  house and then proceeded to go down to
[56:04.000 --> 56:07.040]  genesis after that or it was either the next morning but
[56:07.040 --> 56:11.200]  like i said i mean it really hit home where i mean just a questioning when i
[56:11.200 --> 56:15.520]  was talking to my fiance about what they think i'm planning on
[56:15.520 --> 56:18.400]  doing when they know that i'm not going to do it and just
[56:18.400 --> 56:22.400]  makes me kind of nervous and like i said it's it gives me a little chill but
[56:22.400 --> 56:26.160]  it's not going to stop me in any way check your car every day when you get
[56:26.160 --> 56:30.000]  in it because they'll plant stuff on you some of them uh always go to events
[56:30.000 --> 56:33.680]  with people have multiple cameras and somebody outside
[56:33.680 --> 56:36.480]  and just realize that we're dealing with people
[56:36.480 --> 56:39.600]  whether they're knowingly part of it or not that are pretend the secret service
[56:39.600 --> 56:42.240]  knows they have providers they know the FBI doesn't
[56:42.240 --> 56:44.640]  it's just it's all about stopping the first amendment

[56:48.320 --> 56:52.160]  want to be uh videotaped and have it up on youtube
[56:52.160 --> 56:54.960]  that's what his concern was well let's just be clear i got cameras on the
[56:54.960 --> 56:58.160]  outside of my office and on the inside the secret service has been here and
[56:58.160 --> 57:00.800]  looked at them twice we didn't put that on youtube

[57:13.920 --> 57:17.200]  have surpassed habeas corpus with the uh patriot act
[57:17.200 --> 57:20.320]  and if they want to hold somebody indefinitely they can
[57:20.320 --> 57:24.000]  without legal representation we got a network of people everywhere

[57:40.480 --> 57:45.040]  the cat is out of the bag and it is only going to backfire i mean that's why
[57:45.040 --> 57:47.840]  truth rising so important with the police saying
[57:47.840 --> 57:51.600]  a camera is a gun and saying we're going to plant bombs on you

[1:03:52.560 --> 1:04:02.000]  they tell you more and more and more and more and more and more
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:07.600]  and they get more and more and more and more and more more
[1:04:07.600 --> 1:04:11.600]  send little more and more and more
[1:04:11.600 --> 1:04:14.480]  ay, i'll sing more more
[1:04:14.480 --> 1:04:24.480]  see behind, behind You
[1:04:24.480 --> 1:04:27.280]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah You're my friend
[1:04:27.380 --> 1:04:29.680]  Secret service
[1:04:29.840 --> 1:04:31.380]  Yeah, tellin'
[1:04:31.480 --> 1:04:34.280]  I'm the fortunate one
[1:04:34.380 --> 1:04:36.880]  No, no, no, no
[1:04:36.980 --> 1:04:38.980]  If it be high
[1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:42.480]  High, high, high, high
[1:04:42.580 --> 1:04:45.480]  See, I am high
[1:04:47.380 --> 1:04:49.380]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[1:04:49.480 --> 1:04:52.380]  I've come with a message of information
[1:04:52.380 --> 1:04:54.880]  9-Eleven was an inside job.
[1:04:54.880 --> 1:04:56.080]  You like being a puppet, sir?
[1:04:56.080 --> 1:04:57.680]  You like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[1:04:57.680 --> 1:05:00.580]  I'll do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a stage.
[1:05:00.580 --> 1:05:02.880]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[1:05:02.880 --> 1:05:04.880]  the Thrallateral Commission, the C.F.R.
[1:05:04.880 --> 1:05:06.880]  Can you please sit down and shout out?
[1:05:06.880 --> 1:05:09.180]  The day that we stop asking questions
[1:05:09.180 --> 1:05:12.180]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[1:05:12.180 --> 1:05:13.880]  to grow at our own door.
[1:05:13.880 --> 1:05:16.880]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[1:05:16.880 --> 1:05:19.380]  a global awakening has taken place.
[1:05:19.380 --> 1:05:23.880]  An inside job? How dare you?
[1:05:23.880 --> 1:05:28.380]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[1:05:28.380 --> 1:05:30.380]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:05:30.380 --> 1:05:32.880]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:05:32.880 --> 1:05:35.880]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years,
[1:05:35.880 --> 1:05:38.880]  we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-Eleven.
[1:05:38.880 --> 1:05:42.380]  Please rise and download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now,
[1:05:42.380 --> 1:05:44.380]  or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:05:44.380 --> 1:05:47.380]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[1:05:47.380 --> 1:05:49.880]  High fuel prices for gasoline and diesel
[1:05:49.880 --> 1:05:53.880]  are taking a huge bite out of budgets for individuals and businesses.
[1:05:53.880 --> 1:05:55.880]  But there is something you can do.
[1:05:55.880 --> 1:05:58.380]  FuelSaver Incorporated's fuel enhancer formula
[1:05:58.380 --> 1:06:00.880]  will not only stretch each gallon of fuel further
[1:06:00.880 --> 1:06:02.880]  for mere pennies per treated gallon,
[1:06:02.880 --> 1:06:05.880]  but also cleans fuel injectors, pumps, and reduces emissions.
[1:06:05.880 --> 1:06:07.880]  Average improvement in fuel economy
[1:06:07.880 --> 1:06:10.880]  typically ranges from 8% to 20% or more,
[1:06:10.880 --> 1:06:14.880]  saving you 30 to 80 cents on each gallon of fuel at the pump.
[1:06:14.880 --> 1:06:16.880]  Now there's a boost for your budget.

[1:08:33.880 --> 1:08:35.880]  That's the great part about a criminal government.
[1:08:35.880 --> 1:08:41.880]  They've got all these little cops who are compartmentalized, who get to deny what they're part of,
[1:08:41.880 --> 1:08:45.880]  and they have certainly trained a lot of people how to violate the Bellarites,
[1:08:45.880 --> 1:08:48.880]  the Constitution, how to butcher this country and overturn it.
[1:08:48.880 --> 1:08:50.880]  And I, for one, am sick of it.
[1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:53.880]  Okay, I got Barack Obama calling for world government.
[1:08:53.880 --> 1:08:55.880]  You gotta love it, they're always saying New World Order this.
[1:08:55.880 --> 1:08:59.880]  Bill Clinton, George Bush Sr., on and on and on.
[1:08:59.880 --> 1:09:02.880]  And the New World Order means world government, tyrannical world government.
[1:09:02.880 --> 1:09:05.880]  That's his definition. Hitler called for it.
[1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:11.880]  He goes to Germany and calls for it, and the media says it doesn't exist.
[1:09:11.880 --> 1:09:15.880]  Remember that. It doesn't exist when we say we don't want it and have North American Union documents,
[1:09:15.880 --> 1:09:18.880]  and they're putting in NAFTA highways as they build them.
[1:09:18.880 --> 1:09:21.880]  They say it doesn't exist.
[1:09:21.880 --> 1:09:23.880]  They talk to us like we're children.
[1:09:23.880 --> 1:09:26.880]  It's like people walking out of your house with TV sets they're stealing,
[1:09:26.880 --> 1:09:29.880]  and your computer, and your jewelry, and your clothes, and you say,
[1:09:29.880 --> 1:09:32.880]  What are you doing stealing? Drop that hands up.
[1:09:32.880 --> 1:09:35.880]  And they say, I'm not taking anything. There's no television set.
[1:09:35.880 --> 1:09:38.880]  I don't exist. I'm not here. You're crazy.
[1:09:38.880 --> 1:09:43.880]  And some people are so weak-minded they might say, oh, okay, you're not here.
[1:09:43.880 --> 1:09:46.880]  You walk into your house, your couch has been loaded in the truck,
[1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:49.880]  in the big van, they're stealing everything, and I guess you just sit down on the floor
[1:09:49.880 --> 1:09:51.880]  and imagine there's a couch there.
[1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:54.880]  And we got goons running around trying to set people up with our press passes,
[1:09:54.880 --> 1:09:57.880]  saying they're going to charge them with false documents.
[1:09:57.880 --> 1:10:00.880]  We've got death threats flowing in.
[1:10:00.880 --> 1:10:02.880]  We've got all sorts of corruption going on.
[1:10:02.880 --> 1:10:04.880]  We've got them violating the First Amendment everywhere.
[1:10:04.880 --> 1:10:07.880]  Secret arrest, the Bill of Rights overturned.
[1:10:07.880 --> 1:10:10.880]  They're about to launch a war on a country that doesn't have any nuclear weapons.
[1:10:10.880 --> 1:10:11.880]  This isn't even close.
[1:10:11.880 --> 1:10:13.880]  CIA says seven years, but the media doesn't care.
[1:10:13.880 --> 1:10:15.880]  They go, oh, no, it's decades away.
[1:10:15.880 --> 1:10:20.880]  But reality says decades away, but they say, oh, no, they've got it right now.
[1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:21.880]  We've got to hit them right now.
[1:10:21.880 --> 1:10:25.880]  Iran's real vicious and threatening to nuke Israel when they're not.
[1:10:25.880 --> 1:10:32.880]  Meanwhile, Special Forces and Wahhabi al-Qaeda groups admittedly are in Iran for five years,
[1:10:32.880 --> 1:10:36.880]  bombing, shooting police, blowing up schools, White House brags about it,
[1:10:36.880 --> 1:10:40.880]  and says, we're in Iran fighting al-Qaeda when they're using al-Qaeda.
[1:10:40.880 --> 1:10:48.880]  Sunnis, a subgroup of the Sunnis, the Wahhabist, fighting the Shiites opposite group.
[1:10:48.880 --> 1:10:51.880]  They talk to you like you're idiots.
[1:10:51.880 --> 1:10:53.880]  It's unbelievable.
[1:10:53.880 --> 1:10:55.880]  Now, I want to hear about the Cassinage hearing.
[1:10:55.880 --> 1:10:57.880]  I've been watching some of it, reading articles, but I want to talk to callers.
[1:10:57.880 --> 1:11:01.880]  Islai, Mike, Nolan, and others that have, Islai just dropped.
[1:11:01.880 --> 1:11:05.880]  Islai, I was going to you, and we had a bunch of other callers and other subjects,
[1:11:05.880 --> 1:11:07.880]  but you can call them with the line open.
[1:11:07.880 --> 1:11:11.880]  If you specifically have been watching the Cassinage hearings where they stacked the deck
[1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:15.880]  with a bunch of other people worshipping Bush, saying he's done nothing wrong.
[1:11:15.880 --> 1:11:18.880]  We know Bush is a puppet, but he's been the instrument to carry out all these crimes
[1:11:18.880 --> 1:11:20.880]  and false wars and lies.
[1:11:20.880 --> 1:11:23.880]  So let's go to Mike and Florida, then Nolan, and others.
[1:11:23.880 --> 1:11:27.880]  Mike, you're on the air.
[1:11:27.880 --> 1:11:29.880]  Go ahead, Mike, you're on the air.
[1:11:29.880 --> 1:11:30.880]  What's going on, Alex?
[1:11:30.880 --> 1:11:31.880]  Well, why broadcast?
[1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:32.880]  You say you've been watching the hearings.
[1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:33.880]  Give us your takeoff.
[1:11:33.880 --> 1:11:34.880]  I have been.
[1:11:34.880 --> 1:11:36.880]  I've been bouncing in and out since you've been coming on.
[1:11:36.880 --> 1:11:39.880]  I've been more or less paying attention to your show.
[1:11:39.880 --> 1:11:42.880]  There's a lot of passionate supporters that are going on or passionate, you know,
[1:11:42.880 --> 1:11:45.880]  people out there really speaking truth.
[1:11:45.880 --> 1:11:50.880]  And what I'm caught up by is the fact that it's not mentioned anywhere on mainstream
[1:11:50.880 --> 1:11:51.880]  media at all.
[1:11:51.880 --> 1:11:53.880]  I mean, I was thankful that C-SPAN even put it on.
[1:11:53.880 --> 1:11:56.880]  I didn't even think they were going to do that today.
[1:11:56.880 --> 1:12:05.880]  You know, the fact that now that we have an Obama speech that's being spoken in France
[1:12:05.880 --> 1:12:09.880]  that's highlighting over what people are actually saying in this hearing.
[1:12:09.880 --> 1:12:17.880]  The fact that they're pulling out the Constitution, blacking out spots on issues that the Bush
[1:12:17.880 --> 1:12:20.880]  administration has actually canceled out of our Constitution.
[1:12:20.880 --> 1:12:27.880]  And the fact that there's these people on this committee that think that it's ludicrous
[1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:31.880]  to be sitting here and even considering a peaching bush.
[1:12:31.880 --> 1:12:36.880]  It's crazy, and it's not getting the due process that it wants, but it is a huge step,
[1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:37.880]  and it's very passionate.
[1:12:37.880 --> 1:12:41.880]  You know, I'm so thankful for people like Dennis Guthinage.
[1:12:41.880 --> 1:12:43.880]  The gentleman is in charge of the veterans for peace.
[1:12:43.880 --> 1:12:45.880]  He spoke very, very elegantly.
[1:12:45.880 --> 1:12:48.880]  Bob Barr, he's spoken very well.
[1:12:48.880 --> 1:12:50.880]  So good things are happening.
[1:12:50.880 --> 1:12:55.880]  I'm upset that it's not being shared more on mainstream.
[1:12:55.880 --> 1:12:57.880]  This is huge news.
[1:12:57.880 --> 1:13:06.880]  This is the Judiciary Committee hearing testimony to bring impeachment before the House of Representatives
[1:13:06.880 --> 1:13:08.880]  and it's not on any of the channels.
[1:13:08.880 --> 1:13:09.880]  We're flipping around.
[1:13:09.880 --> 1:13:10.880]  We're checking them.
[1:13:10.880 --> 1:13:12.880]  There's a news blackout on this.
[1:13:12.880 --> 1:13:15.880]  This is unbelievable.
[1:13:15.880 --> 1:13:22.880]  Additionally, as I'm flipping through CNN and MSNBC and whatnot, they also have the big
[1:13:22.880 --> 1:13:28.880]  story about how there was the airplane that almost went down due to the same thing that
[1:13:28.880 --> 1:13:29.880]  happened with Ron Paul on board.
[1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:33.880]  And they're giving out a story, but I didn't really, I'm not paying attention to mainstream
[1:13:33.880 --> 1:13:35.880]  media too much anymore.
[1:13:35.880 --> 1:13:40.880]  But I'm not sure they gave that a highlighting platform as well.
[1:13:40.880 --> 1:13:42.880]  But yet I see it doing it for it.
[1:13:42.880 --> 1:13:46.880]  Well, they're also discussing Barack Obama, the eternal distraction.
[1:13:46.880 --> 1:13:47.880]  That's all it is.
[1:13:47.880 --> 1:13:48.880]  Oh, look at our puppet.
[1:13:48.880 --> 1:13:49.880]  Look at him.
[1:13:49.880 --> 1:13:50.880]  Will he win?
[1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:52.880]  Oh, it does he have what it takes?
[1:13:52.880 --> 1:13:53.880]  It doesn't matter.
[1:13:53.880 --> 1:13:54.880]  He runs nothing.
[1:13:54.880 --> 1:13:55.880]  He is no one.
[1:13:55.880 --> 1:14:00.880]  What's sad is, and I don't want to say what's up to all we are changed people out there,
[1:14:00.880 --> 1:14:02.880]  especially we are changed Florida.
[1:14:02.880 --> 1:14:04.880]  Tomorrow we're going to get on it.
[1:14:04.880 --> 1:14:10.880]  I myself, I'm a veteran of the wars.
[1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:15.880]  Truth rising was definitely something that woke me up and got me there to get moving.
[1:14:15.880 --> 1:14:17.880]  And I want to thank you for it.
[1:14:17.880 --> 1:14:22.880]  I want to thank every member of we are changed, especially good old Luke there.
[1:14:22.880 --> 1:14:26.880]  I mean, that man's got a, yeah, he's got heart.
[1:14:26.880 --> 1:14:30.880]  And, you know, I was an Obama supporter.
[1:14:30.880 --> 1:14:33.880]  I was a big Obama supporter because I wanted the war to end.
[1:14:33.880 --> 1:14:34.880]  I want to change.
[1:14:34.880 --> 1:14:35.880]  I wanted it.
[1:14:35.880 --> 1:14:38.880]  When I first started hearing you say that Obama was this and Obama was that, it just
[1:14:38.880 --> 1:14:40.880]  didn't make sense to me.
[1:14:40.880 --> 1:14:43.880]  And I want to thank you guys so much for the Bilderberg coverage you do, because that woke
[1:14:43.880 --> 1:14:44.880]  me up.
[1:14:44.880 --> 1:14:50.880]  And I'm an extremely passionate, educated human being and one that feels that there's
[1:14:50.880 --> 1:14:52.880]  no greater fight in the world than to do this.
[1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:54.880]  And I'm not scared to put my life on the line for it.
[1:14:54.880 --> 1:14:56.880]  I've done it before.
[1:14:56.880 --> 1:14:59.880]  And yeah, I don't know what they're doing with Obama.
[1:14:59.880 --> 1:15:00.880]  He's not the answer.
[1:15:00.880 --> 1:15:03.880]  Well, I want to say to all the veterans that he's a distraction.
[1:15:03.880 --> 1:15:04.880]  It's like McCain.
[1:15:04.880 --> 1:15:09.880]  I want to say to all the veterans, you know, the only difference between McCain is he's
[1:15:09.880 --> 1:15:13.880]  a looks like a colorless chipmunk as he's been called.
[1:15:13.880 --> 1:15:20.880]  And Obama is more handsome that that is the only difference is he's younger and better
[1:15:20.880 --> 1:15:22.880]  looking and better spoken.
[1:15:22.880 --> 1:15:24.880]  That's the only difference in all the veterans.
[1:15:24.880 --> 1:15:29.880]  Yeah, you've been brought into false fake wars, destroy our treasury, loot our treasury,
[1:15:29.880 --> 1:15:30.880]  destroy our name.
[1:15:30.880 --> 1:15:35.880]  The real fight is here in the homeland, in the republic that's being dismantled by enemies,
[1:15:35.880 --> 1:15:36.880]  internal.
[1:15:36.880 --> 1:15:40.880]  Many coups have gotten control of central governments and used outside wars to unify
[1:15:40.880 --> 1:15:44.880]  the population around the real target, bringing down the country to the looters.
[1:15:44.880 --> 1:15:46.880]  And we are bringing and brought down.
[1:15:46.880 --> 1:15:50.880]  They're talking about Ford and GM mainstream news may collapse in the next two months.
[1:15:50.880 --> 1:15:53.880]  They're saying that they basically already are bankrupt.
[1:15:53.880 --> 1:15:58.880]  Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, that's 55 plus trillion leveraged into the thousands of trillions.
[1:15:58.880 --> 1:16:02.880]  Yes, you heard me, thousands of trillions.
[1:16:02.880 --> 1:16:05.880]  Sperm counts have dropped by more than 85% in the West.
[1:16:05.880 --> 1:16:09.880]  Cancer is exploding thousands and thousands of percentiles.
[1:16:09.880 --> 1:16:16.880]  Juvenile onset of cancer, early onset of Alzheimer's and 25 year olds from the toxins were being
[1:16:16.880 --> 1:16:17.880]  sprayed.
[1:16:17.880 --> 1:16:19.880]  We're under chemical biological attack.
[1:16:19.880 --> 1:16:22.880]  Every cop, every secret service agent, don't roll your eyes.
[1:16:22.880 --> 1:16:24.880]  Go find out their testing on us for heaven's sakes.
[1:16:24.880 --> 1:16:25.880]  Find out.
[1:16:25.880 --> 1:16:26.880]  They engineered the AIDS virus.
[1:16:26.880 --> 1:16:31.880]  We've read the declassified documents here on air and had medical doctors on and Library
[1:16:31.880 --> 1:16:32.880]  of Congress.
[1:16:32.880 --> 1:16:33.880]  You can get these.
[1:16:33.880 --> 1:16:34.880]  You're being killed.
[1:16:34.880 --> 1:16:35.880]  You're with us.
[1:16:35.880 --> 1:16:37.880]  We're under attack here.
[1:16:37.880 --> 1:16:39.880]  Anybody can see what's going on.
[1:16:39.880 --> 1:16:41.880]  And I appreciate your call, sir.
[1:16:41.880 --> 1:16:45.880]  I mean, all the veterans, this is the battle for the Republic right now.
[1:16:45.880 --> 1:16:48.880]  They want to get Americans fighting with each other in another fake election over Republican
[1:16:48.880 --> 1:16:49.880]  Democrat.
[1:16:49.880 --> 1:16:50.880]  It means nothing.
[1:16:50.880 --> 1:16:51.880]  The deck is stacked.
[1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:53.880]  All the ponies in the race are owned by the same people.
[1:16:53.880 --> 1:16:58.880]  It's like a Don King professional fight.
[1:16:58.880 --> 1:16:59.880]  It's rigged.
[1:16:59.880 --> 1:17:01.880]  He owns both the fighters.
[1:17:01.880 --> 1:17:03.880]  It doesn't matter who takes the dive.
[1:17:03.880 --> 1:17:05.880]  It doesn't matter what round they go down.
[1:17:05.880 --> 1:17:07.880]  It doesn't matter what happens.
[1:17:07.880 --> 1:17:10.880]  It is a staged event.
[1:17:10.880 --> 1:17:11.880]  Period.
[1:17:11.880 --> 1:17:12.880]  Things is important.
[1:17:12.880 --> 1:17:14.880]  They don't leave up to chance.
[1:17:14.880 --> 1:17:16.880]  They're moving against the web to shut it down.
[1:17:16.880 --> 1:17:18.880]  I got more news on that today.
[1:17:18.880 --> 1:17:19.880]  It's all happening.
[1:17:19.880 --> 1:17:21.880]  I've risked my life 110% for this.
[1:17:21.880 --> 1:17:23.880]  It isn't a game, people.
[1:17:23.880 --> 1:17:25.880]  That goes for our own movement.
[1:17:25.880 --> 1:17:27.880]  Get your head screwed on straight.
[1:17:27.880 --> 1:17:30.880]  You're risking your lives doing this, your treasure, everything.
[1:17:30.880 --> 1:17:32.880]  But you don't have a choice where we're going.
[1:17:32.880 --> 1:17:35.880]  It's so bad that it's better to fight and have no chance of winning.
[1:17:35.880 --> 1:17:37.880]  But we do have a chance of winning.
[1:17:37.880 --> 1:17:38.880]  What a church you'll say.
[1:17:38.880 --> 1:17:42.880]  You know, there are times in history to paraphrase when you have a chance to fight early and
[1:17:42.880 --> 1:17:43.880]  you're assured of victory.
[1:17:43.880 --> 1:17:49.880]  And then still there's a worse prospect of fighting when you don't have a very good chance.
[1:17:49.880 --> 1:17:51.880]  When there's little chance of victory.
[1:17:51.880 --> 1:17:53.880]  But then there's the final equation.
[1:17:53.880 --> 1:17:57.880]  If you wait too long, you're going to be forced to fight when there is no chance of winning.
[1:17:57.880 --> 1:18:03.880]  But it's better to fight and die on your own two legs instead of in a ditch.
[1:18:03.880 --> 1:18:05.880]  You understand that, ladies and gentlemen?
[1:18:05.880 --> 1:18:07.880]  And we've got a good chance of winning.
[1:18:07.880 --> 1:18:09.880]  We have had courage.
[1:18:09.880 --> 1:18:11.880]  We have aggressively exposed the terrorist.
[1:18:11.880 --> 1:18:13.880]  We have aggressively moved forward against them.
[1:18:13.880 --> 1:18:15.880]  We've exposed so many of their programs.
[1:18:15.880 --> 1:18:18.880]  Congress has a 9% approval rating.
[1:18:18.880 --> 1:18:24.880]  Congress has a lower approval rating by six points than Richard Nixon when he resigned.
[1:18:24.880 --> 1:18:25.880]  Okay?
[1:18:25.880 --> 1:18:27.880]  We're winning!
[1:18:27.880 --> 1:18:32.880]  Now, some of us have got the tough job of walking point, being shocktribs in this, like
[1:18:32.880 --> 1:18:36.880]  Anthony Asha and myself and Luke Radowski and many others.
[1:18:36.880 --> 1:18:39.880]  All we're asking is we're going to go through the wall, folks.
[1:18:39.880 --> 1:18:41.880]  We've already gone over the wall.
[1:18:41.880 --> 1:18:46.880]  We're inside the gates, trying to open the drawbridge in hand-to-hand infowar combat with
[1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:47.880]  huge hordes of enemies.
[1:18:47.880 --> 1:18:48.880]  We are fighting.
[1:18:48.880 --> 1:18:50.880]  We've got the drawbridge halfway down.
[1:18:50.880 --> 1:18:52.880]  Throw grapples on it from across the moat.
[1:18:52.880 --> 1:18:57.880]  Pull that son of a bitch down right now and start coming over with us!
[1:18:57.880 --> 1:19:01.880]  This is it!
[1:19:01.880 --> 1:19:06.880]  We've got to attack them in the infowar and discredit these murderers now.
[1:19:06.880 --> 1:19:12.880]  And there's a lot of black ops and a lot of government psych warfare experts and people tuning in.
[1:19:12.880 --> 1:19:17.880]  And I just say this, you know in your gut, even in your dark psychos, that you're being killed by your masters
[1:19:17.880 --> 1:19:19.880]  and you're being abused by your lords.
[1:19:19.880 --> 1:19:23.880]  And you, for your own preservation, should join us against the dark side.
[1:19:23.880 --> 1:19:25.880]  Don't you understand that?
[1:19:25.880 --> 1:19:26.880]  No, you don't.
[1:19:26.880 --> 1:19:28.880]  You're of your father, the devil.
[1:19:28.880 --> 1:19:30.880]  So you're going to continue to submit.
[1:19:30.880 --> 1:19:33.880]  Nolan in Texas has been watching the consent and sharing everyone.
[1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:34.880]  Right to you after a break.
[1:19:34.880 --> 1:19:35.880]  I'm going to try to get to others more quickly.
[1:19:35.880 --> 1:19:37.880]  1-800-25 at 99-231.
[1:19:37.880 --> 1:19:39.880]  Got a bunch of news.
[1:19:39.880 --> 1:19:42.880]  Barack Obama calling for New World Order.
[1:19:42.880 --> 1:19:46.880]  His total craziness is everything and intensifies a mass global quickening.
[1:19:46.880 --> 1:20:14.880]  1-800-25 at 99-231.
[1:20:14.880 --> 1:20:16.880]  Like a book on the history of the Federal Reserve.

[1:21:14.880 --> 1:21:16.880]  The New World Order.
[1:21:16.880 --> 1:21:19.880]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:21:19.880 --> 1:21:22.880]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[1:21:22.880 --> 1:21:24.880]  Everything they have built over the centuries.
[1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:26.880]  The wealth they have accumulated.
[1:21:26.880 --> 1:21:27.880]  The power they have established.
[1:21:27.880 --> 1:21:29.880]  The poisoning of the masses.
[1:21:29.880 --> 1:21:31.880]  The destruction of the earth and mankind.
[1:21:31.880 --> 1:21:35.880]  We will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.
[1:21:35.880 --> 1:21:39.880]  Visit our website at unveilingthem.com.

[1:21:44.880 --> 1:21:46.880]  The message of his kingdom.
[1:21:46.880 --> 1:21:49.880]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[1:21:49.880 --> 1:21:51.880]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[1:21:51.880 --> 1:21:55.880]  Tonight I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[1:21:55.880 --> 1:21:58.880]  And today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[1:21:58.880 --> 1:22:02.880]  Finalized the contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston.
[1:22:02.880 --> 1:22:04.880]  Online from my desk with Webex.

[1:22:47.880 --> 1:22:49.880]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[1:22:49.880 --> 1:22:55.880]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[1:22:55.880 --> 1:22:59.880]  That's right. Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[1:22:59.880 --> 1:23:06.880]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[1:23:06.880 --> 1:23:14.880]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[1:23:14.880 --> 1:23:19.880]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[1:23:19.880 --> 1:23:25.880]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[1:23:25.880 --> 1:23:30.880]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[1:23:30.880 --> 1:23:33.880]  Call 800-686-2237.
[1:23:33.880 --> 1:23:35.880]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[1:23:35.880 --> 1:23:39.880]  Call 800-686-2237.
[1:23:39.880 --> 1:24:05.880]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[1:24:05.880 --> 1:24:13.880]  Here we now seem to be the third election in a row, which is going to be really, really close.
[1:24:13.880 --> 1:24:15.880]  That's some of the hearing.
[1:24:15.880 --> 1:24:25.880]  We're getting some ex-service going to play later in the next hour for you going on endless droning by those against going forward with impeachment investigations and those against.
[1:24:25.880 --> 1:24:27.880]  So we will be getting to that.
[1:24:27.880 --> 1:24:30.880]  Nolan in Texas, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:24:30.880 --> 1:24:37.880]  Yeah, Alex. I called Connors office and I was really steamed about that.
[1:24:37.880 --> 1:24:41.880]  Just handcuffing Kucinich. That's just not all right.
[1:24:41.880 --> 1:24:46.880]  I asked if he had read the Constitution and she seemed to think that he had.
[1:24:46.880 --> 1:24:51.880]  I said, well, why is it that he's got a problem with the First Amendment?
[1:24:51.880 --> 1:24:55.880]  And she said that he didn't think that Connors had anything to do with this.
[1:24:55.880 --> 1:24:59.880]  And of course, I can't argue that point.
[1:24:59.880 --> 1:25:05.880]  He said sandbagging. We have the press releases. They did tell Kucinich he couldn't bring up articles of impeachment.
[1:25:05.880 --> 1:25:10.880]  Oh, I'm not saying you're wrong. I feel lied to by them, trust me.
[1:25:10.880 --> 1:25:18.880]  And Lamar Smith, I was just watching him. He's pointing out how many times the word impeachment has come up in a hearing that is not an impeachment hearing.
[1:25:18.880 --> 1:25:20.880]  Yeah, let's see. Here he is right here.
[1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:27.880]  We have to add Franklin Roosevelt to the list because there are allegations that he wanted to get us into World War II.
[1:25:27.880 --> 1:25:30.880]  There may be other presidents, but...
[1:25:30.880 --> 1:25:36.880]  Yeah, that was Smith going to somebody saying that, oh, Bush is FDR. He's wonderful. Everything's fine. Go ahead, sir.
[1:25:36.880 --> 1:25:40.880]  Well, sir, I've listened to you for five years. I knew things were wrong before.
[1:25:40.880 --> 1:25:43.880]  I just didn't have the information to put it together.
[1:25:43.880 --> 1:25:52.880]  You gave me the tools to go out and find what I needed to become an educated American and to quit being a propagandized parrot like the rest of these people.
[1:25:52.880 --> 1:26:00.880]  They don't want to stop being what they are. They don't mind having their lives based on life.
[1:26:00.880 --> 1:26:07.880]  Everything they think, say, and do is based on certain things they take for granted, and these things are what they've been taught in school,
[1:26:07.880 --> 1:26:10.880]  and they don't want their lives, their whole paradigm, to shift.
[1:26:10.880 --> 1:26:16.880]  Well, here's the deal. We're going to lose our good economy and be slaves.
[1:26:16.880 --> 1:26:23.880]  The whole point of this is that America ceases to exist if they're able to convert us into this New World Order globalist system.
[1:26:23.880 --> 1:26:28.880]  And that's what people better realize is that GM and Ford are about to go bankrupt.
[1:26:28.880 --> 1:26:33.880]  The Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are going under. Folks, I mean, the globalists did this, and we told you they would.
[1:26:33.880 --> 1:26:36.880]  We were right. We warned you.
[1:26:36.880 --> 1:26:46.880]  A whole day in one forum, open three threads, started pounding them with different things, and out of all of that, out of 60 or 80 people who read that forum,
[1:26:46.880 --> 1:26:54.880]  one person came to me with solid questions. I gave him back references, links to your sites, links to other sites,
[1:26:54.880 --> 1:27:02.880]  and one person seems to have enough curiosity to actually go see if I'm nuts, which, you know, that's what he accused me of.
[1:27:02.880 --> 1:27:08.880]  He said, you're ten full hat, you know. And I told him, look, you know, coming across clear here, right? I'm not stupid.
[1:27:08.880 --> 1:27:13.880]  Listen to me. Go look. Prove me wrong. Make me wrong. I'd be much happier wrong.
[1:27:13.880 --> 1:27:21.880]  But the Bush is a puppet. I don't really mind that. He's a willful puppet. He's happily a puppet. I mind that.
[1:27:21.880 --> 1:27:28.880]  I finally got mad. The American people are trained not to be angry, not to have any emotion.
[1:27:28.880 --> 1:27:36.880]  You can only have emotion from when the ball gets hiked until the whistle blows, and then you have to stop and be all politically correct.
[1:27:36.880 --> 1:27:47.880]  I'm sick of all this. I really thank you for what you're doing. I'm recording these hearings, and I'm very proud that Kucinich has done this,
[1:27:47.880 --> 1:27:54.880]  and I'm very, very comforted that Ron Paul walked away. I'll be listening to you. I listen to you every day.
[1:27:54.880 --> 1:28:01.880]  And I would like to do something. I'd like to ask you if you could possibly do this stuff. I know you're very busy.
[1:28:01.880 --> 1:28:06.880]  But on your website, if you could, I try to grasp it, but it's too quick for me.
[1:28:06.880 --> 1:28:12.880]  If you could put up a place where I could come and understand what is Wahabi and Shi'ite and how those different things work,
[1:28:12.880 --> 1:28:19.880]  and another spot that explains where communism came from, and some of these people that were transferred here and there,
[1:28:19.880 --> 1:28:26.880]  and it shows the subterfuge so that I can send people there and let them learn it, let them see it, and let them go prove it or disprove it.
[1:28:26.880 --> 1:28:36.880]  I know. Okay, well, just type Islam into Google and just go to, there's all sorts of university sites and other areas,
[1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:41.880]  or get a basic book on Islam, the CIA Factbook, they're honest on their own website,
[1:28:41.880 --> 1:28:49.880]  and it'll just explain that right after Muhammad died, it's split into two different groups.
[1:28:49.880 --> 1:28:56.880]  Those that said it should be hereditary, that you had to be related to the Prophet Muhammad and to his family,
[1:28:56.880 --> 1:29:05.880]  to be a religious leader, an Imam, and then there was a break off.
[1:29:05.880 --> 1:29:13.880]  That Shi'ite, and at the same time the Sunnis broke off, about 83% of the world's Muslims are Sunni,
[1:29:13.880 --> 1:29:20.880]  that means they believe anybody can be a religious leader, and about 15% are,
[1:29:20.880 --> 1:29:25.880]  and you can debate these numbers, about 50% are Shi'ite, and there's another little bit of subgroup that's a few percentage points,
[1:29:25.880 --> 1:29:30.880]  so that's it, Iran is Shi'ite, the opposite group from where Al-Qaeda comes from,
[1:29:30.880 --> 1:29:34.880]  but the media says Iran is Al-Qaeda, that's because they know the public doesn't understand.
[1:29:34.880 --> 1:29:37.880]  Hold your eye back.
[1:29:37.880 --> 1:29:41.880]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[1:29:41.880 --> 1:29:47.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[1:30:47.880 --> 1:30:56.880]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[1:30:56.880 --> 1:31:03.880]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[1:31:03.880 --> 1:31:12.880]  Whitman, EPA director on the AT made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:31:12.880 --> 1:31:19.880]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[1:31:19.880 --> 1:31:28.880]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:31:28.880 --> 1:31:37.880]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[1:31:37.880 --> 1:31:46.880]  Or order the DVD at infowars.com. If we don't expose the government sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.

[1:33:01.880 --> 1:33:09.880]  Classical tyranny is trying to bring down and loot the United States and use it as a continued engine of evil.
[1:33:09.880 --> 1:33:14.880]  Will we let our currency, our treasury, our name be destroyed forever?
[1:33:14.880 --> 1:33:17.880]  See, the globalist play nations off against each other.
[1:33:17.880 --> 1:33:19.880]  India and China aren't going to come out on top of this.
[1:33:19.880 --> 1:33:22.880]  They're not bringing down the U.S. They're going to bring them down.
[1:33:22.880 --> 1:33:27.880]  The U.S. imploding will bring down the world economy. Every expert, every economist agrees with that.
[1:33:27.880 --> 1:33:33.880]  Taking your calls about the impeachment hearings that are going on that they're saying you can't call impeachment.
[1:33:33.880 --> 1:33:38.880]  Play some clips of that coming up in the next hour. Got a guest, Freeman, coming in the last hour as well.
[1:33:38.880 --> 1:33:43.880]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, on the 25th day of July, 2008.
[1:33:43.880 --> 1:33:47.880]  By next week I should know something about whether we're going to have a concert with Willie Nelson
[1:33:47.880 --> 1:33:50.880]  and a bunch of other people in Austin, Texas. I'll just leave it at that.
[1:33:50.880 --> 1:33:53.880]  Very exciting things going on. I'm talking to those folks daily.
[1:33:53.880 --> 1:33:57.880]  It's just tough to do it in the next few months in such short notice of big venues.
[1:33:57.880 --> 1:33:59.880]  We'll probably get 40,000-50,000 people there, but we'll see what happens.
[1:33:59.880 --> 1:34:03.880]  It looks looking good, but I don't want to cross my fingers and jinx this.
[1:34:03.880 --> 1:34:08.880]  Let's go to... Who's the first caller here? Islay?
[1:34:08.880 --> 1:34:12.880]  Islay in Florida. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:34:12.880 --> 1:34:14.880]  How's it going, Alex?
[1:34:14.880 --> 1:34:15.880]  Good. You're on the air.
[1:34:15.880 --> 1:34:17.880]  Good. Thanks.
[1:34:17.880 --> 1:34:19.880]  I've been watching it, and I'll be honest with you, man.
[1:34:19.880 --> 1:34:25.880]  I'm a little bit more positive about some of the things that have been said.
[1:34:25.880 --> 1:34:27.880]  I agree. The White House was putting pressure on him,
[1:34:27.880 --> 1:34:30.880]  and so Conyers was claiming it was going to be controlled,
[1:34:30.880 --> 1:34:34.880]  but he can't control it, and the other congressmen who are on the Republican side
[1:34:34.880 --> 1:34:37.880]  keep saying, this is not an impeachment hearing. Be quiet, but it's not working.
[1:34:37.880 --> 1:34:39.880]  Yeah, yeah. No, it's not working at all.
[1:34:39.880 --> 1:34:45.880]  I mean, Vincent Boogalio, he got some great comments, and he got some applause
[1:34:45.880 --> 1:34:50.880]  because of what he said about some of the people in the administration
[1:34:50.880 --> 1:34:54.880]  should be tried for murder, and everybody applauded. I thought that was awesome.
[1:34:54.880 --> 1:34:56.880]  Unbelievable. We've had him on. We're going to have him back on.
[1:34:56.880 --> 1:34:59.880]  Of course, that was the famous prosecutor of Manson and others.
[1:34:59.880 --> 1:35:03.880]  Yeah, yeah. He was great, and I heard his interview with you.
[1:35:03.880 --> 1:35:08.880]  But the big issue is, why isn't this on all the TV networks?
[1:35:08.880 --> 1:35:12.880]  This is news, not Barack Obama running around.
[1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:14.880]  You're right, but you know what? It's going to be.
[1:35:14.880 --> 1:35:16.880]  It's going to be because I think it's going to happen.
[1:35:16.880 --> 1:35:21.880]  I mean, with all of... I've seen the majority of the Democrats
[1:35:21.880 --> 1:35:24.880]  and other people, Bob Barr, made a whole bunch of good points.
[1:35:24.880 --> 1:35:26.880]  I just don't see that they can deny this.
[1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:30.880]  I think it's going to happen. I think it's going to be big news when it does.
[1:35:30.880 --> 1:35:33.880]  I've been watching him on and off all day. Where is Cassinich?
[1:35:33.880 --> 1:35:34.880]  Has he spoken yet?
[1:35:34.880 --> 1:35:41.880]  Yeah, he did. He spoke way early. He spoke like 10, 15-ish, something like that.
[1:35:41.880 --> 1:35:42.880]  Eastern?
[1:35:42.880 --> 1:35:44.880]  Yeah, Eastern time.
[1:35:44.880 --> 1:35:46.880]  Yeah, I got some YouTube clips. We're going to be playing those later.
[1:35:46.880 --> 1:35:49.880]  Yeah, yeah. No, it was really good, though. Dennis was awesome.
[1:35:49.880 --> 1:35:53.880]  I can't remember all of his statements, just because it was so long ago.
[1:35:53.880 --> 1:35:58.880]  Well, we need a headline on Info Wars by Kurt Nemo, my great staff working their butts off,
[1:35:58.880 --> 1:36:05.880]  with something like Damn Breaks on Bush Crimes, Committee Loses Control.
[1:36:05.880 --> 1:36:08.880]  That needs to be the headline from just the text I'm reading here of what's been said.
[1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:13.880]  Boogliosi calls him and says they should be charged for murder. Yes, the dam is breaking.
[1:36:13.880 --> 1:36:18.880]  It's awesome, man. I love it. And it's because of you, and it's because of people like you.
[1:36:18.880 --> 1:36:20.880]  And thank you so much, Alex.
[1:36:20.880 --> 1:36:24.880]  Well, let's watch out. They could go ahead and throw a fit.
[1:36:24.880 --> 1:36:30.880]  When it came out that 1.9-trill, it's now over 4-trill, was stolen from the Pentagon in the Associated Press.
[1:36:30.880 --> 1:36:34.880]  I believe they were planning 9-11 later, but they went ahead and carried it out.
[1:36:34.880 --> 1:36:38.880]  It came out two days before. Two days later, they hit us, because that would have brought them down right there,
[1:36:38.880 --> 1:36:42.880]  stealing that trill.9.
[1:36:42.880 --> 1:36:45.880]  And don't roll your eyes, cops. Go Google it.
[1:36:45.880 --> 1:36:48.880]  But you're so afraid of the tyranny, you won't even Google the missing trillions,
[1:36:48.880 --> 1:36:52.880]  because you know that's all being tracked. Unbelievable coward. Is there anything else?
[1:36:52.880 --> 1:36:58.880]  No, Alex. I just want to say thank you so much for what you're doing and for what you've done in the past.
[1:36:58.880 --> 1:37:02.880]  And it's amazing, and I think we're going to win.
[1:37:02.880 --> 1:37:06.880]  I think we are too, my brother. God bless you and take care, my friend.
[1:37:06.880 --> 1:37:10.880]  Amazing what's happening. We know we're going to win. I mean, if God be with us, it can be an emphasis.
[1:37:10.880 --> 1:37:14.880]  And I don't want to hear all this atheist baloney, but there's not good and evil.
[1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:20.880]  There are more things in heaven and earth than in all of your philosophy.
[1:37:20.880 --> 1:37:24.880]  Let's say, Shakespeare quote.
[1:37:24.880 --> 1:37:30.880]  And they rephrase that in Master and Commander, when the Jonas throws himself overboard and he says to the good doctor,
[1:37:30.880 --> 1:37:36.880]  the ship surgeon, he says, you know, you don't believe in all this mumbo jumbo, all the superstition.
[1:37:36.880 --> 1:37:42.880]  The captain says, there are more things going on in the world than in all of your books, doctor.
[1:37:42.880 --> 1:37:47.880]  There's more things going on than just in your books. It's all about spirit, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:37:47.880 --> 1:37:52.880]  That's what wins battles. That's what builds families. That's what explores continents.
[1:37:52.880 --> 1:37:56.880]  That's what explores oceans. It's what sends us into space.
[1:37:56.880 --> 1:38:00.880]  That's what helps us. You get your mind right. You can bench press 400 pounds.
[1:38:00.880 --> 1:38:04.880]  Normally only bench press 300. I mean, it's all about the soul.
[1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:08.880]  The driving force that animates our earth suits, sort of these fleshly bodies.
[1:38:08.880 --> 1:38:12.880]  I can't believe the secular world is stolen this from you and giving you the lie.
[1:38:12.880 --> 1:38:16.880]  Let's go ahead. That's why I'm not afraid to die, ladies and gentlemen. I don't want to die.
[1:38:16.880 --> 1:38:22.880]  I want to go on and enjoy this life and enjoy this plenty of existence of my children and my wonderful life.
[1:38:22.880 --> 1:38:26.880]  Enjoy the beautiful sky and just the smell of flowers in the field.
[1:38:26.880 --> 1:38:33.880]  Fresh cut grass to see fish swimming around in the bottom of a clear river or creek with turtles.
[1:38:33.880 --> 1:38:41.880]  Jumping off of rocks to see a hot air balloon rising on a beautiful Sunday morning over rolling hills
[1:38:41.880 --> 1:38:49.880]  to walk through the redwoods, the sequoias to look down into a coastal reef in the Caribbean.
[1:38:49.880 --> 1:38:56.880]  The plunge down into the warm water with your mask and snorkel and the interface
[1:38:56.880 --> 1:39:00.880]  with that whole other dimension of life on this planet. There's so much beauty, so much goodness.
[1:39:00.880 --> 1:39:06.880]  And I commit myself fully to defense of it against evil and death.
[1:39:06.880 --> 1:39:11.880]  Let's talk to sing an end to you. Sing, you're on the air.
[1:39:11.880 --> 1:39:12.880]  Yeah, hello?
[1:39:12.880 --> 1:39:14.880]  Yes, sir.
[1:39:14.880 --> 1:39:16.880]  It's an honor meeting you, Alex.
[1:39:16.880 --> 1:39:19.880]  It's an honor to talk to you, sir.
[1:39:19.880 --> 1:39:20.880]  Yeah, it's an honor.
[1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:23.880]  I watched your first documentary, Marshall, in 2005.
[1:39:23.880 --> 1:39:28.880]  Before that, I thought that Osama bin Laden was behind 9-11 attacks.
[1:39:28.880 --> 1:39:33.880]  So after that, I just got my red pill.
[1:39:33.880 --> 1:39:42.880]  And I also wanted to tell you that we also have this National ID cards being implemented here in India by 2010.
[1:39:42.880 --> 1:39:48.800]  Yes, globally in the same year, the exact same program names, the same global prefix
[1:39:48.800 --> 1:39:56.280]  universal ID number under you in 3D 2000 signed in Australia, it is global government, it
[1:39:56.280 --> 1:40:01.280]  is going in right now, and it is a mass eugenics operation.
[1:40:01.280 --> 1:40:08.040]  Yeah, and also like before yesterday, we had a motion of confidence for the parliament
[1:40:08.040 --> 1:40:12.800]  will the government survive or not, and it was found that the opposition party members
[1:40:12.800 --> 1:40:18.040]  of drive or at least two million dollars to vote for the ruling party, which is Congress.
[1:40:18.040 --> 1:40:23.880]  So just, just, just you can see that they are driving intimidating just to get hold
[1:40:23.880 --> 1:40:26.040]  on power for this nuclear deal.
[1:40:26.040 --> 1:40:29.640]  I don't know why it's so important nuclear in the United States and India, and why the
[1:40:29.640 --> 1:40:34.240]  government is so desperate to wave, to sign this deal.
[1:40:34.240 --> 1:40:40.560]  Yeah, it's corruption and looting and every form of thievery in institutions has just
[1:40:40.560 --> 1:40:41.560]  gone to seed.
[1:40:41.560 --> 1:40:46.320]  It is, it is like a horrible staff infection of flesh eating bacteria racing through our
[1:40:46.320 --> 1:40:51.560]  body eating our flesh, and the public has to at least admit, I mean, even if everybody
[1:40:51.560 --> 1:40:54.640]  woke up now, we would be hard to turn it around.
[1:40:54.640 --> 1:40:59.360]  Folks, you don't have a hope or a prayer if you don't have the will to stand up against
[1:40:59.360 --> 1:41:00.360]  evil.
[1:41:00.360 --> 1:41:03.480]  And, and look at other United States, that is the criminals that have hijacked us gave
[1:41:03.480 --> 1:41:05.720]  nukes to Pakistan to menace India.
[1:41:05.720 --> 1:41:10.160]  I mean, it's just never ending.
[1:41:10.160 --> 1:41:17.520]  And also one more thing I would like to give a website address to you, it's www.cadng.com.
[1:41:17.520 --> 1:41:22.120]  You may, I think, like it or don't like it, but it's, it's in the lines of David Icke
[1:41:22.120 --> 1:41:28.280]  research, like it talks about like the Civil War and the independence movement in the United
[1:41:28.280 --> 1:41:31.360]  States was actually instigated by the British Empire.
[1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:35.160]  They wanted to teach, they want to teach a lesson to the colonists.
[1:41:35.160 --> 1:41:40.280]  So actually to, that's why they had this 1776 revolution was from the British side, not
[1:41:40.280 --> 1:41:45.760]  the, not the United States side, but they failed their original plan for new order was
[1:41:45.760 --> 1:41:50.880]  way back in 1776 to merge this church and the British Empire.
[1:41:50.880 --> 1:41:54.760]  That's why when they failed, they had this alternative plan known as Industrial Revolution,
[1:41:54.760 --> 1:41:58.080]  which had all the technologies and all the stuff and now we are here.
[1:41:58.080 --> 1:42:02.600]  It's very awesome website if you, if you, if you do want to read it, please go to the
[1:42:02.600 --> 1:42:03.600]  website.
[1:42:03.600 --> 1:42:04.600]  They're unaware of that.
[1:42:04.600 --> 1:42:05.600]  That's good info.
[1:42:05.600 --> 1:42:07.760]  They also tried to stage the Civil War and I'm from the South.
[1:42:07.760 --> 1:42:08.880]  I'm not bashing the South.
[1:42:08.880 --> 1:42:10.360]  My family was all in the Confederate side.
[1:42:10.360 --> 1:42:13.000]  The point is they meant well, but they were manipulated.
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:16.240]  They tried to have a civil war when Andrew Jackson was president, but he saw through
[1:42:16.240 --> 1:42:22.720]  it and found out that the British Intel, the Her Majesty's Secret Service, as they're
[1:42:22.720 --> 1:42:27.680]  called, were manipulating the South and that definitely happened there, but they failed
[1:42:27.680 --> 1:42:28.680]  there as well.
[1:42:28.680 --> 1:42:30.960]  Thank you so much for the call from Andrea.
[1:42:30.960 --> 1:42:31.960]  Scott in Arizona.
[1:42:31.960 --> 1:42:32.960]  You're on the air worldwide.
[1:42:32.960 --> 1:42:33.960]  Hey Alex.
[1:42:33.960 --> 1:42:34.960]  I just wanted to say great job.
[1:42:34.960 --> 1:42:42.520]  I'm the one who called the other day and was talking to you and Willie about doing the
[1:42:42.520 --> 1:42:43.520]  concert.
[1:42:43.520 --> 1:42:46.200]  I'm glad that it seems to be moving forward.
[1:42:46.200 --> 1:42:48.400]  That's a good, good thing to hear.
[1:42:48.400 --> 1:42:53.720]  Also, you know, repeating what Dennis said on your show that day about calling the media.
[1:42:53.720 --> 1:42:58.160]  Maybe we can get them to do some excerpts from what happened today, even on your local
[1:42:58.160 --> 1:42:59.160]  media station.
[1:42:59.160 --> 1:43:03.200]  I think that might be cool as well, but thanks a lot, Alex.
[1:43:03.200 --> 1:43:06.000]  I wanted to give you much appreciation for that.
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  Well, Scott, I'm glad that you called in and said, hey Willie, you ought to have a concert.
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  I'll tell you this.
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:17.600]  I really wanted to be free and then get business sponsorship, corporate sponsorship, drive a
[1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:21.960]  giant free event, but even if it's quote free, we got to pay to get the bands there
[1:43:21.960 --> 1:43:22.960]  and pay for their expenses.
[1:43:22.960 --> 1:43:27.000]  You know, they'll, they'll, they'll waive their fees, I'm sure, but it's, it's going
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  to be big.
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:31.640]  I think we could have 50,000 people in and around Austin and then have a huge media
[1:43:31.640 --> 1:43:32.640]  event out of that.
[1:43:32.640 --> 1:43:34.640]  It doesn't mean it will save the world, but every little bit helps and this will be a
[1:43:34.640 --> 1:43:35.640]  big thing.
[1:43:35.640 --> 1:43:36.640]  So thank you, Scott.
[1:43:36.640 --> 1:43:38.640]  I'm going to be talking to Willie tomorrow.
[1:43:38.640 --> 1:43:42.520]  Well, a lot's going on behind the scenes.
[1:43:42.520 --> 1:43:46.920]  I'm just going to leave it at that, but we don't rise or fall on that.
[1:43:46.920 --> 1:43:49.600]  It's looking good, but I'm not going to hold my breath because I just can't stand worrying
[1:43:49.600 --> 1:43:50.600]  about it.
[1:43:50.600 --> 1:43:55.720]  Now, let's go ahead and talk to, well, Seth in the UK just hung up, Robert in California,
[1:43:55.720 --> 1:43:56.720]  you're on the year.
[1:43:56.720 --> 1:43:58.320]  How are you doing, sir?
[1:43:58.320 --> 1:43:59.320]  Good.
[1:43:59.320 --> 1:44:00.320]  Okay.
[1:44:00.320 --> 1:44:03.400]  One of the bring up some, something that's, that's happening and what people have been
[1:44:03.400 --> 1:44:09.720]  seeing and plus one other thing, um, right now in this war, they're trying to sever our
[1:44:09.720 --> 1:44:14.080]  lines of communication one amongst each other and that would be the internet.
[1:44:14.080 --> 1:44:15.080]  Yes.
[1:44:15.080 --> 1:44:20.560]  They've announced their, um, systematically shutting it down, starting, uh, you know,
[1:44:20.560 --> 1:44:26.440]  in England, Canada, and of course, uh, France starting next month.
[1:44:26.440 --> 1:44:27.440]  Yeah.
[1:44:27.440 --> 1:44:32.640]  And I don't think the people are really understanding in our movement, um, and the fringes who are
[1:44:32.640 --> 1:44:37.040]  fighting amongst each other and trying to get it, that we need to come together to stop
[1:44:37.040 --> 1:44:42.160]  this because without this, uh, communication, we won't be able to coordinate our efforts
[1:44:42.160 --> 1:44:43.160]  and stuff.
[1:44:43.160 --> 1:44:44.160]  Yeah.
[1:44:44.160 --> 1:44:46.280]  Unfortunately, about a third of the quote movement only critiques other people thinking
[1:44:46.280 --> 1:44:48.240]  that will make them the King Jesus.
[1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:53.680]  They have no idea the responsibility, the pressure, uh, of actually doing that.
[1:44:53.680 --> 1:44:57.800]  And they never wake anybody up about fluoride or mercury or poisons or wars.
[1:44:57.800 --> 1:45:01.840]  It's just all endlessly whining and bitching about other groups and a lot of that's going
[1:45:01.840 --> 1:45:02.840]  to help her.
[1:45:02.840 --> 1:45:04.920]  A lot of it isn't, but we just have to ignore those people.
[1:45:04.920 --> 1:45:09.520]  I wouldn't even engage them, uh, for those that aren't wicked who are just deceived.
[1:45:09.520 --> 1:45:13.440]  We can try to wake them up and reach out to them, pray that they'd have their eyes opened.
[1:45:13.440 --> 1:45:15.720]  Uh, but really we don't have time for that.
[1:45:15.720 --> 1:45:16.720]  Uh, sure.
[1:45:16.720 --> 1:45:17.720]  Go ahead.
[1:45:17.720 --> 1:45:18.720]  Yeah.
[1:45:18.720 --> 1:45:23.360]  And that's absolutely right because, uh, we need to grow our numbers and cause there's
[1:45:23.360 --> 1:45:27.000]  many people who are just waking up now and they're still sort of unprepared.
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  Yeah.
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:31.600]  There's brand new people by the millions coming online every day and then a third of
[1:45:31.600 --> 1:45:35.160]  our movement just bitches and gripes and says, this person's bad, that person's bad
[1:45:35.160 --> 1:45:40.320]  and whines about exactly who runs it or the exact, I mean, we know it's a global government.
[1:45:40.320 --> 1:45:43.480]  It's got every major group under its control, uh, in government religion.
[1:45:43.480 --> 1:45:44.480]  It's moving against us.
[1:45:44.480 --> 1:45:46.040]  It's carrying out eugenics against us.
[1:45:46.040 --> 1:45:50.240]  Well, when we know we have to stop it, huh, I mean, it's really that simple.
[1:45:50.240 --> 1:45:51.240]  Yeah.
[1:45:51.240 --> 1:45:57.160]  And the other thing is, uh, uh, make a clarification about a story that was, uh, being, uh, put
[1:45:57.160 --> 1:46:01.840]  forth by you and others about how they're blocking out, uh, California driver's license,
[1:46:01.840 --> 1:46:07.120]  basically how the system works and how it was instituted besides beyond police officers.
[1:46:07.120 --> 1:46:12.160]  We had a few, uh, incidents with us and social workers and supervisors were attacked.
[1:46:12.160 --> 1:46:16.400]  So they went before the legislation and I know there's another, uh, lady who's trying
[1:46:16.400 --> 1:46:20.040]  to put forth that it's going to go to dog catchers and everybody else.
[1:46:20.040 --> 1:46:25.320]  But as the, the numbers grow with this blocked license, it's your private license.
[1:46:25.320 --> 1:46:30.000]  Basically your, your private vehicle, which is blocked from being reviewed by anybody
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:35.320]  who pulls you over, um, but that doesn't stop police officers as yet from pulling people
[1:46:35.320 --> 1:46:36.320]  over.
[1:46:36.320 --> 1:46:37.320]  Cause we know we've had a few.
[1:46:37.320 --> 1:46:38.320]  Yeah.
[1:46:38.320 --> 1:46:39.320]  But for those that don't know what you're talking about.
[1:46:39.320 --> 1:46:45.200]  There's 994,000 people as of last year, the numbers are always a year old and it's growing
[1:46:45.200 --> 1:46:51.240]  by hundreds of thousands a year, uh, in California, can't get red light tickets, the cops basically
[1:46:51.240 --> 1:46:55.480]  let them go and then, and, and, and, and it's a form of being above the law.
[1:46:55.480 --> 1:46:58.240]  Uh, I understand I'm all for people having their privacy.
[1:46:58.240 --> 1:47:03.640]  The problem is, is that, uh, it is now becoming a elite class and it's being abused.
[1:47:03.640 --> 1:47:09.040]  Uh, well, it, that's, that's the thing and as this goes on, you know, the, the police
[1:47:09.040 --> 1:47:13.240]  uh, the people if they're bought out or are going to disregard that, they're just going
[1:47:13.240 --> 1:47:14.240]  to be pulling them over.
[1:47:14.240 --> 1:47:18.800]  Now, as far as the red light, uh, or, or parking tickets, what happens is that license is
[1:47:18.800 --> 1:47:19.800]  blocked.
[1:47:19.800 --> 1:47:22.400]  So there's, they're unable to pull up the information.
[1:47:22.400 --> 1:47:26.280]  Um, if you travel to other states, I'm not sure if they can, you know, pull you over
[1:47:26.280 --> 1:47:31.120]  or pull up that information, but this is a form, it can be abused and probably will
[1:47:31.120 --> 1:47:36.880]  be, but it probably will, they'll do is they'll start facing it out again, back down to just
[1:47:36.880 --> 1:47:38.640]  probably police officers or government officials.
[1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:39.640]  I hear you.
[1:47:39.640 --> 1:47:40.640]  I appreciate your call.
[1:47:40.640 --> 1:47:41.640]  Um, let's go ahead.
[1:47:41.640 --> 1:47:43.600]  I mean, I'm against it.
[1:47:43.600 --> 1:47:48.760]  I think people, you know, in my life, I don't get any special breaks and I'm a media figure
[1:47:48.760 --> 1:47:52.760]  and people, that's why you should be armed and that's why we should all know how to fight
[1:47:52.760 --> 1:47:57.280]  and uh, you know, people come after you, stand up for yourself against them.
[1:47:57.280 --> 1:48:01.520]  Now I know that's why CPS and others and I know that's not all social workers, but
[1:48:01.520 --> 1:48:04.680]  that's why they pick on nice Christian families because they can kidnap their kids and be
[1:48:04.680 --> 1:48:05.680]  left alone.
[1:48:05.680 --> 1:48:09.120]  I believe criminals are beating their children with tire irons alone because they're scared
[1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:11.760]  of them.
[1:48:11.760 --> 1:48:13.880]  That's what the, that's what the revenue generating cops do now.
[1:48:13.880 --> 1:48:18.360]  They leave the hardcore crooks and the Los Zetas and MS 13 alone and then feed on the
[1:48:18.360 --> 1:48:19.360]  American people.
[1:48:19.360 --> 1:48:22.600]  And I've had enough of it.
[1:48:22.600 --> 1:48:26.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brett in Florida.
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  You're on the air.
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  Go ahead, Brett.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  Hey Alex, this is Brent.
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  How are you doing today?
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  Good.
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:35.660]  Um, just want to let you know, I'm, I'm an ex-member of Naval Special Forces, been involved
[1:48:35.660 --> 1:48:38.640]  in the Patriot movement since I got out in 91.
[1:48:38.640 --> 1:48:43.600]  Um, I've been listening to your show for the past year or so and I'm just absolutely blown
[1:48:43.600 --> 1:48:45.560]  away by the response that you guys get.
[1:48:45.560 --> 1:48:47.360]  You're absolutely doing a great job.
[1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:48.360]  Thank you.
[1:48:48.360 --> 1:48:52.760]  Um, what I'd like to do is, uh, let all these, uh, wonderful people out there know that have
[1:48:52.760 --> 1:48:56.120]  been in the past militias and all that stuff.
[1:48:56.120 --> 1:48:57.600]  It's not about the guns, man.
[1:48:57.600 --> 1:49:03.520]  It's time to drop those weapons, bury them actually and pick up cameras, bull horns and
[1:49:03.520 --> 1:49:08.560]  the internet while we still have time and get the word out that a lot of nasty stuff's
[1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:09.560]  going on.
[1:49:09.560 --> 1:49:13.080]  Everything from fluoride to vaccines, I agree with you a hundred percent.
[1:49:13.080 --> 1:49:18.240]  The whole reason co-intel pro works is because they, they can divide us.
[1:49:18.240 --> 1:49:24.120]  There are so many issues to be divided upon that it's, it's stupid and they're succeeding
[1:49:24.120 --> 1:49:29.320]  when they get, when they can divide us on information of, uh, the politics, you know,
[1:49:29.320 --> 1:49:32.000]  Barack or, uh, McCain.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  It doesn't matter.
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  It's all predetermined.
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  Yeah.
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  That's a big projection.
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:38.480]  So we never see the man behind the curtain.
[1:49:38.480 --> 1:49:43.080]  We need to get way past that and say, no world government, no Iran attack, no cashless
[1:49:43.080 --> 1:49:44.080]  society.
[1:49:44.080 --> 1:49:46.920]  I mean, they're passing a law where CPS will visit everyone's home.
[1:49:46.920 --> 1:49:51.200]  I mean, I told you folks that it's all coming down.
[1:49:51.200 --> 1:49:52.200]  It definitely is.
[1:49:52.200 --> 1:49:53.600]  And you know, I've got a lot to worry about.
[1:49:53.600 --> 1:49:54.600]  I've got a big family.
[1:49:54.600 --> 1:49:55.920]  I got four great kids.
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:49:57.480]  We all home school.
[1:49:57.480 --> 1:49:59.160]  My wife, you know, God bless her.
[1:49:59.160 --> 1:50:01.800]  She's new to the movement, um, the Patriot movement.
[1:50:01.800 --> 1:50:05.920]  She had her awakening about a month or so ago and she's just blown away by how, how
[1:50:05.920 --> 1:50:12.440]  much wool has been pulled over the American's eyes on everything from TV to politics to
[1:50:12.440 --> 1:50:13.440]  religion.
[1:50:13.440 --> 1:50:14.440]  You know, I'm not, I don't want to jump.
[1:50:14.440 --> 1:50:18.640]  So even though you were awake, your wife was still kind of like, Oh, you know, uh,
[1:50:18.640 --> 1:50:20.880]  my husband's a little goofy, but now I mean, what woke her up?
[1:50:20.880 --> 1:50:22.120]  I want to hear about this when we get back.
[1:50:22.120 --> 1:50:23.120]  Okay.
[1:50:23.120 --> 1:50:24.120]  Yeah.
[1:50:24.120 --> 1:50:25.120]  Stay there, uh, Brett.
[1:50:25.120 --> 1:50:28.920]  As a brand, I don't know the point is, we'll be right back after this quick break on a ton
[1:50:28.920 --> 1:50:29.920]  of news I'm going to cover.
[1:50:29.920 --> 1:50:34.440]  We got into Barack Obama calling for world government and it isn't about Barack Obama
[1:50:34.440 --> 1:50:37.400]  and I don't like him cause he's black or no.
[1:50:37.400 --> 1:50:41.880]  It's about the fact that he has said he is with the new oil order gang as if we didn't
[1:50:41.880 --> 1:50:42.880]  know that.
[1:50:42.880 --> 1:50:48.600]  Now he's declared it in front of everybody.
[1:50:48.600 --> 1:50:56.120]  Question is the world getting better or vastly worse, the world economic collapse could come
[1:50:56.120 --> 1:51:05.560]  any day, question, are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs, question, do you have
[1:51:05.560 --> 1:51:16.440]  seven years of healthy food for your family and go to survivalist seeds.com.

[1:51:47.360 --> 1:51:52.520]  Do you still think that $4 a gallon at the gas pump is your worst problem in this country?
[1:51:52.520 --> 1:51:58.080]  Bank failures, rising food prices and an ever-weakening dollar are only the beginning of a much larger
[1:51:58.080 --> 1:51:59.320]  crisis.
[1:51:59.320 --> 1:52:04.800]  Why have America's politicians abandoned the rule of law in favor of the rule of men?
[1:52:04.800 --> 1:52:09.480]  The majority of this nation's elected officials have become drunk on the power and illusion
[1:52:09.480 --> 1:52:12.240]  of authority that only lawless men and women seek.
[1:52:12.240 --> 1:52:16.640]  They no longer strive to protect American ideals but rather they have abandoned the
[1:52:16.640 --> 1:52:19.600]  very rule book that they have sworn an oath to defend.
[1:52:19.600 --> 1:52:22.720]  Will the American people let these crimes go unpunished?
[1:52:22.720 --> 1:52:27.080]  Do the American people even understand the crimes that have been committed?
[1:52:27.080 --> 1:52:29.040]  Where does it stop?
[1:52:29.040 --> 1:52:33.200]  Washington You're Fired is a film about true change in D.C. with true solutions to our

[1:52:58.520 --> 1:53:00.920]  destroys the official fable forever.

[1:53:05.280 --> 1:53:10.080]  family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous
[1:53:10.080 --> 1:53:12.000]  crime are brought to justice.
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:15.520]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[1:53:15.520 --> 1:53:19.920]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases, to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change
[1:53:19.920 --> 1:53:23.680]  Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[1:53:38.880 --> 1:53:41.760]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[1:53:41.760 --> 1:53:46.000]  Loose Change Final Cut is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  back to Big Brother.
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:54:15.000]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:18.880]  Calling for a New World Order and then you talk about New World Order at college or work.
[1:54:18.880 --> 1:54:22.000]  They say crazy people talk about that it doesn't exist.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:26.080]  On CNN and Fox, say the trans-Texas corridor doesn't exist, doesn't matter if they're putting
[1:54:26.080 --> 1:54:29.360]  it in the billboards or up, it's every person in Texas knows about it.
[1:54:29.360 --> 1:54:32.960]  They just say, no, that's not real.
[1:54:32.960 --> 1:54:34.840]  We have been trained, mesmerized.
[1:54:34.840 --> 1:54:43.040]  We have literally had a spell put on us, and all that means is hypnotized to just sleepwalk,
[1:54:43.040 --> 1:54:44.040]  and TV does that.
[1:54:44.040 --> 1:54:48.800]  It puts you in a dumb-down state that's admitted, your actual brainwifes.
[1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:50.480]  It's time to wake up.
[1:54:50.480 --> 1:54:55.160]  Here's the alarm clock.
[1:54:55.160 --> 1:54:58.280]  Dangerous hardcore, ruthless people are in control.
[1:54:58.280 --> 1:54:59.640]  We're the big jewel.
[1:54:59.640 --> 1:55:02.080]  They've seized control of the government, both parties.
[1:55:02.080 --> 1:55:03.080]  They're selling us out.
[1:55:03.080 --> 1:55:04.440]  They've been selling us out for a long time.
[1:55:04.440 --> 1:55:06.000]  It's coming to a head.
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:09.920]  They know it's going to collapse, and they know you're going to then get upset.
[1:55:09.920 --> 1:55:12.440]  They're putting a preemptive control grid in place.
[1:55:12.440 --> 1:55:13.440]  Wake up.
[1:55:13.440 --> 1:55:18.600]  Danger, Will Robinson, danger.
[1:55:18.600 --> 1:55:22.280]  Is it Bret or Brent?
[1:55:22.280 --> 1:55:29.000]  Brent, finish up, so your wife wasn't waking up, even though you've been in naval special
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:33.680]  warfare, even though she knows you're smart, she wouldn't listen to you, but what finally
[1:55:33.680 --> 1:55:34.680]  woke her up?
[1:55:34.680 --> 1:55:37.160]  I think it was a culmination of a lot of things.
[1:55:37.160 --> 1:55:42.320]  She saw, I can't remember what movie it was.
[1:55:42.320 --> 1:55:48.560]  I think it was Freedom to Fascism, or Maruso, and it all started falling into place.
[1:55:48.560 --> 1:55:52.400]  Very important film.
[1:55:52.400 --> 1:55:53.400]  Very important.
[1:55:53.400 --> 1:55:58.680]  God bless Aaron Russo and the work that we, the people, are doing over there.
[1:55:58.680 --> 1:56:03.640]  But what I would like to do is let you guys know that one of the things, one of the keys
[1:56:03.640 --> 1:56:08.080]  to success in special forces is what we call force projection.
[1:56:08.080 --> 1:56:12.080]  I'm sure you're familiar with this term, but maybe some of your listeners aren't.
[1:56:12.080 --> 1:56:15.800]  Force projection is when you've got a bunch of people, you come together and you just
[1:56:15.800 --> 1:56:19.880]  keep hitting them, and hitting them, and hitting them non-stop.
[1:56:19.880 --> 1:56:22.640]  We have to be tenacious.
[1:56:22.640 --> 1:56:26.320]  The Wolverine is the most tenacious animal in the world because it can take down a full
[1:56:26.320 --> 1:56:29.640]  bear because it refuses to stop attacking.
[1:56:29.640 --> 1:56:34.880]  Just the way that New World Order has been on us, like white on rice, we have to do the
[1:56:34.880 --> 1:56:36.640]  same thing.
[1:56:36.640 --> 1:56:43.480]  Everything from getting into the council chambers and saying, no, we're not going to accept
[1:56:43.480 --> 1:56:44.480]  this.
[1:56:44.480 --> 1:56:49.400]  We do everything in our power, time and time again, relentlessly hitting them.
[1:56:49.400 --> 1:56:53.640]  Until the buzz is everywhere, until they're knee-deep in Patriot films and needy and phone
[1:56:53.640 --> 1:56:58.680]  calls to mainline talk shows and micro FM pirate transmitters everywhere picking up satellite
[1:56:58.680 --> 1:57:04.920]  of Genesis, going crazy, going to every event they're at, citizens speaking up, asking
[1:57:04.920 --> 1:57:09.320]  serious questions, holding up the Miami Herald saying it says they protected bin Laden's
[1:57:09.320 --> 1:57:15.400]  people and released them, saying, don't call that a conspiracy theory, until they can't
[1:57:15.400 --> 1:57:19.320]  deny it, until all the King's horses and all the King's men can't put their New World
[1:57:19.320 --> 1:57:26.560]  Order fraud back together again, and yes, it's really forced multiplication where we just
[1:57:26.560 --> 1:57:31.120]  go out, not even taking orders from headquarters, there is no headquarters, the idea of liberty
[1:57:31.120 --> 1:57:36.720]  and engaging them everywhere we can and being focused and aggressive and not timid.
[1:57:36.720 --> 1:57:40.560]  We'll follow leadership also, we've got to be bold, we've got to be focused, and we've
[1:57:40.560 --> 1:57:44.480]  got to realize that this is all about commitment.
[1:57:44.480 --> 1:57:51.120]  Without a doubt, Alex, you're either in or you're out, there's always going to be those
[1:57:51.120 --> 1:57:54.800]  people that are sitting on the sidelines, you know, I've experienced that, they want
[1:57:54.800 --> 1:57:57.920]  to do this, they want to do that, they just don't have the impetus, well everybody's
[1:57:57.920 --> 1:58:02.880]  got to have a line in the sand, and mine was drawn years ago when I got out of Desert
[1:58:02.880 --> 1:58:03.880]  Storm.
[1:58:03.880 --> 1:58:09.760]  I mean, I saw some atrocities back then that would just, it'd melt your face.
[1:58:09.760 --> 1:58:14.360]  Hold on, I guess a lot of that's been declassified now, you want to come back and tell us some,
[1:58:14.360 --> 1:58:16.560]  just for a minute or two, some of the atrocities you saw?
[1:58:16.560 --> 1:58:17.560]  Well, yeah.
[1:58:17.560 --> 1:58:20.640]  Well, stay there, and I'm going to get to everybody else and the Barack Obama clip
[1:58:20.640 --> 1:58:29.480]  at eight after, as he calls for a New World Order.
[1:58:29.480 --> 1:58:36.480]  Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:36.480 --> 1:58:43.200]  May I have everybody's attention please, I've come with a message of information, 9-Eleven
[1:58:43.200 --> 1:58:45.200]  was an inside job.
[1:58:45.200 --> 1:58:46.200]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[1:58:46.200 --> 1:58:47.920]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[1:58:47.920 --> 1:58:52.520]  How do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a stage, was it engineered by you, David
[1:58:52.520 --> 1:58:59.520]  Rockefeller, that fall out or commissioned the C.A. Park?
[1:58:59.520 --> 1:59:02.360]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[1:59:02.360 --> 1:59:04.360]  to grow at our own door.
[1:59:04.360 --> 1:59:09.360]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:59:09.360 --> 1:59:14.040]  An inside job, how dare you?
[1:59:14.040 --> 1:59:20.360]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:59:20.360 --> 1:59:23.360]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:59:23.360 --> 1:59:28.160]  If the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary
[1:59:28.160 --> 1:59:29.160]  of 9-Eleven.
[1:59:29.160 --> 1:59:34.840]  Please rise, download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:59:34.840 --> 1:59:40.480]  It's now time to take the revolution at the next level.
[1:59:40.480 --> 1:59:52.520]  Raging War on Corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:59:52.520 --> 1:59:53.520]  Government cover-ups.

[1:59:54.520 --> 1:59:56.520]  Well, so does he.
