[00:00.000 --> 00:16.720]  You found it. The tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show. And now your host, David
[00:16.720 --> 00:23.720]  Knight.
[00:23.720 --> 00:28.560]  Welcome on this day after Christmas 2018. I hope you had a nice Christmas. I was certainly
[00:28.560 --> 00:36.040]  dead in my family. And as we see in Washington, they've actually even lit the Christmas tree.
[00:36.040 --> 00:39.640]  This is the sort of thing that we've seen before from the National Park Service. Not
[00:39.640 --> 00:44.960]  playing reindeer games, but playing the kind of national park games that they did 20 some
[00:44.960 --> 00:51.400]  odd years ago when we had the budget fight between Newt Gingrich and the Democrats. And
[00:51.400 --> 00:55.720]  of course, at that time, if you remember, he was the Gingrich who stole Christmas. He took
[00:55.720 --> 01:01.200]  all the blame for balancing the budget. But Bill Clinton got all the credit later on.
[01:01.200 --> 01:04.200]  So we got the National Park Foundation that had to shut down a Christmas tree earlier
[01:04.200 --> 01:07.640]  because somebody had tried to climb it. They said, well, we don't have the money now to
[01:07.640 --> 01:12.440]  reopen it. But they short circuited those optics because that's what they wanted. They
[01:12.440 --> 01:16.680]  always want to close down. Whenever they say there's a threat to the federal government,
[01:16.680 --> 01:21.440]  they come out and they take the most visible symbolic things, the parks, the Christmas trees,
[01:21.440 --> 01:25.520]  turn off the lights. They short circuited that optic. They got a grant from the National
[01:25.520 --> 01:32.160]  Park Foundation. It's going to keep them open until January the 1st. But of course, President
[01:32.160 --> 01:36.480]  Trump said he's going to keep open this promise that he made to the American people when he
[01:36.480 --> 01:40.760]  ran for office that he's going to protect the border. And that really has Washington
[01:40.760 --> 01:47.680]  upset. We're going to talk today about what is happening in terms of the president standing
[01:47.680 --> 01:57.560]  very strong on protecting our country, bringing us home from foreign wars, and also trying
[01:57.560 --> 02:02.920]  to do something about the Federal Reserve. As I tweeted out this morning, even as it's
[02:02.920 --> 02:08.760]  Christmas week, we're going to see the mainstream media pushing back. When we're talking about
[02:08.760 --> 02:15.360]  peace on Earth, they're going to push war on Earth. When we talk about the eternal life,
[02:15.360 --> 02:20.880]  there was a gift of God that we celebrate with the advent of Christ. They're going to
[02:20.880 --> 02:27.000]  talk about eternal life using blood that they can get from young people, transfusions or
[02:27.000 --> 02:32.120]  whatever the transhumanist idea is. See the mainstream media articles popping up all the
[02:32.120 --> 02:36.680]  place. Oh, you can live forever. A lot of people don't want to die. They said, of course,
[02:36.680 --> 02:45.160]  who wants to die, right? And so we have the fake alternatives of transhumanism and other
[02:45.160 --> 02:50.520]  things that are presented to us. And of course, the massive censorship of Christmas and then
[02:50.520 --> 02:54.120]  trying to turn it into something it isn't. It's the censorship of it. It's trying to
[02:54.120 --> 02:59.280]  take the good news to counterfeit it, to twist it into something else. So we're going to
[02:59.280 --> 03:02.480]  push back against that today. We're going to talk about the good news about eternal life
[03:02.480 --> 03:13.120]  and peace on Earth. You know, it was 104 years ago at Christmas time that we had the short
[03:13.120 --> 03:18.000]  truce breakout in World War One. They had the British and German troops are very close
[03:18.000 --> 03:23.320]  to each other. You know the story, I'm sure, about Silent Night. They had a tenor from
[03:23.320 --> 03:27.600]  the Berlin Opera stand up and start to sing it first in German, then in English. It was
[03:27.600 --> 03:33.080]  joined, it turned into a truce for several days. But the generals couldn't have that.
[03:33.080 --> 03:39.640]  Couldn't have peace breaking out around a common culture, a common religion around the
[03:39.640 --> 03:45.000]  time of Christ. Had to stop that. They eventually did. And then they threatened the troops.
[03:45.000 --> 03:51.080]  Don't you ever do that again. We will take very severe penalties from anybody that fraternizes
[03:51.080 --> 03:58.960]  with the enemy. And so they kept that war going for another four years until they ended
[03:58.960 --> 04:07.040]  it. We just celebrated the 100th anniversary of the end of the war to end all wars. But
[04:07.040 --> 04:12.400]  of course it didn't end all wars did it. And we're going to talk about the push to try
[04:12.400 --> 04:16.160]  to keep the wars going on because we've got President Trump saying, look, we've beaten
[04:16.160 --> 04:23.480]  ISIS. Clearly we have. As I pointed out when I did the show on Sunday, the Russians just
[04:23.480 --> 04:30.240]  a couple of weeks ago, they're running 100 to 110 flights per day over Syria. Then they
[04:30.240 --> 04:35.440]  stopped it in the last couple of weeks. They're only running two to four flights per week.
[04:35.440 --> 04:39.200]  And yeah, it's time to bring the troops home to clear victory and come home. Rand Paul
[04:39.200 --> 04:44.520]  had some amazing things that he put out. He does it every year under the cover of Festivus
[04:44.520 --> 04:51.080]  and the airing of grievances. And he had some great things to say about war and the absurdity
[04:51.080 --> 04:54.680]  of Washington. And we're going to take a look at President Trump, home alone in the White
[04:54.680 --> 05:00.480]  House. Can he keep those creepy burglars out? We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[05:00.480 --> 05:05.520]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[05:05.520 --> 05:10.840]  law. If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact
[05:10.840 --> 05:16.520]  that the emperor has no clothes that can call BS, it's game over. But if you look at everybody
[05:16.520 --> 05:20.720]  else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they
[05:20.720 --> 05:26.520]  are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted. There's only two groups
[05:26.520 --> 05:32.800]  in the U.S., Info Wars and Matt Drudge and Drudge Report.com that are truly independent.
[05:32.800 --> 05:37.480]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world. It really is amazing.
[05:37.480 --> 05:42.040]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight
[05:42.040 --> 05:45.680]  we're all in and how far we've come together. Just remind you that you are the power, you're
[05:45.680 --> 05:51.720]  the strength, you're the will of Info Wars. So please spread the links, infowars.com,
[05:51.720 --> 05:55.960]  newswars.com, christenpana.com, because if you don't spread the articles in the videos,
[05:55.960 --> 06:00.960]  no one else will. We're all in each other's hands. God bless you all and thank you.
[06:25.960 --> 06:29.920]  David Knight, your host today. We're going to take a look at what's happening in Washington.
[06:29.920 --> 06:35.320]  This is a key moment, folks. President Trump has made some very strong moves in the last
[06:35.320 --> 06:40.400]  week. I really do think we need to support him. He's going to have a lot of opposition
[06:40.400 --> 06:45.040]  as we've seen over the weekend. The actions of Steve Mnuchin, the Wall Street Journal,
[06:45.040 --> 06:50.120]  the mainstream media pushing back against everything that he's doing, criticizing everything
[06:50.120 --> 06:55.600]  that he's doing, laying all the blame of all the economic activity that we see, even though
[06:55.600 --> 07:00.440]  we know that the Federal Reserve did everything that it could to puncture the bubble that
[07:00.440 --> 07:06.440]  it created, and raising interest rates in everybody's face. Of course, it's all about
[07:06.440 --> 07:10.960]  President Trump and what he did. Nothing that the Federal Reserve does is ever criticized
[07:10.960 --> 07:11.960]  in the mainstream press.
[07:11.960 --> 07:18.680]  And when President Trump talks about getting rid of the chair of the Federal Reserve, you
[07:18.680 --> 07:24.840]  have Steve Mnuchin and his new White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, saying, oh,
[07:24.840 --> 07:28.360]  he didn't mean that. Oh, no, he can't do that. Oh, he knows he can't do that. We know that
[07:28.360 --> 07:33.240]  he can, quite frankly. We'll tell you later in the program exactly how and why he can
[07:33.240 --> 07:39.760]  do that. I think the smart move would be to audit the Fed. If you were to audit the Fed,
[07:39.760 --> 07:46.240]  if you were to expose what they do in secret, you would have everybody demanding that not
[07:46.240 --> 07:52.600]  only the chairman, but the rest of them, be shown the door. And it's pretty obvious that
[07:52.600 --> 07:59.520]  it's either gross malpractice or malicious actions that the Fed has been involved in.
[07:59.520 --> 08:04.480]  Ever since President Trump was elected, they began raising rates that 1st December after
[08:04.480 --> 08:10.700]  he was elected early November. And they've been raising them a quarter of a percent every
[08:10.700 --> 08:15.260]  quarter since then. I said at the time, I said they're going to do the same thing that
[08:15.260 --> 08:16.260]  Greenspan did.
[08:16.260 --> 08:20.640]  He took interest rates down, created a bubble, holding them at zero. And then he burst that
[08:20.640 --> 08:25.360]  bubble by raising interest rates a quarter of a percent every single quarter. And that's
[08:25.360 --> 08:29.920]  exactly what they've done. And they said they're going to continue to do that. It is malicious.
[08:29.920 --> 08:34.960]  But let's talk a little bit about what's going on in the news before we get into these other
[08:34.960 --> 08:35.960]  issues.
[08:35.960 --> 08:41.680]  We have Senator Paul has taken on Lindsey Graham and many other people about war and peace
[08:41.680 --> 08:47.040]  and many other issues in Washington in a hilarious way. Of course, he does it under cover of
[08:47.040 --> 08:54.560]  celebrating Festivus, the Seinfeld made up holiday, the airing of grievances and so forth.
[08:54.560 --> 09:00.560]  But very, very funny what he had to say about Lindsey Graham saying, I haven't seen a senator
[09:00.560 --> 09:05.920]  who loves war this much since the Star Wars prequels. And he shows Senator Palpatine there
[09:05.920 --> 09:09.840]  in his more satanic form. He's got a lot of stuff there, but we're going to talk about
[09:09.840 --> 09:16.920]  what's really going on with the war in Syria and the pushback against that. There is a
[09:16.920 --> 09:26.120]  Green New Deal, all the talk around Washington now from Alexandria occasional cortex. And
[09:26.120 --> 09:31.840]  it is a very radical New Deal. And it is like FDR's New Deal. It is going to be a radical
[09:31.840 --> 09:37.640]  expansion of the government. That's the kind of red and green that we are being offered
[09:37.640 --> 09:38.640]  by the Democrats.
[09:38.640 --> 09:42.760]  We're going to take a look at that and how it is already playing out in Europe and how
[09:42.760 --> 09:48.120]  they've already tipped their hand that this isn't about saving the environment at all,
[09:48.120 --> 09:54.160]  folks. It's about controlling your life, about taxing you. It's about tracking you. It's
[09:54.160 --> 09:58.320]  not about saving the environment. So we're going to expose that coming up as well. Let's
[09:58.320 --> 10:03.720]  take a look a little bit at some of the twisting of Christmas that's being done in the mainstream
[10:03.720 --> 10:10.920]  media by many people. We got speaking of Alexandria occasional cortex. She was out there pushing
[10:10.920 --> 10:17.880]  this Jesus was a refugee nonsense. And we got that being done in a lot of churches. And
[10:17.880 --> 10:24.760]  folks, if you go by a church that's got their nativity scene in a cage, run as fast as you
[10:24.760 --> 10:33.320]  can the other way. Not only these people not know anything about the Bible or Christianity
[10:33.320 --> 10:37.360]  or they're lying to you about it, but they're also subjugating that to their own political
[10:37.360 --> 10:45.200]  agenda, twisting it to fit. And so what she is saying is we've got refugee babies in
[10:45.200 --> 10:53.560]  majors everywhere. No, not really. Not really. Actually, the story of Jesus, he was his family.
[10:53.560 --> 11:00.120]  It was forced to travel to their home so that they could be taxed. So if you want to parallel
[11:00.120 --> 11:05.040]  to that occasional cortex, what you would do is you would say, well, we're going to
[11:05.040 --> 11:11.840]  send all the Hondurans back to their home so that they can be taxed. We're gonna force
[11:11.840 --> 11:18.080]  them to make that trip. These people who are coming here were not forced to make this trip.
[11:18.080 --> 11:23.920]  And they're not refugees. They are waving the flag of the country that they're supposedly
[11:23.920 --> 11:28.880]  fleeing as President Trump pointed out and burning our flag at the same time. And the
[11:28.880 --> 11:34.840]  Democrats are trying to use them to burn down this country politically. I think it's absolutely
[11:34.840 --> 11:40.320]  deplorable that these people, these Democrats who hate everything about Christmas, who try
[11:40.320 --> 11:48.400]  to purge it from not only being seen but heard, would use this to serve their political agenda.
[11:48.400 --> 11:53.120]  And part of what they're doing is the death, the tragic death of an eight-year-old Guatemalan
[11:53.120 --> 11:57.840]  boy. And the headlines everywhere, even in conservative media, will read something like
[11:57.840 --> 12:06.640]  U.S. Boy Dies and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol custody. Folks, he was not killed by
[12:06.640 --> 12:13.080]  Border Patrol. He was not killed by us protecting our border. Where is the discussion in any
[12:13.080 --> 12:19.160]  of these articles, whether it's coming from mainstream media or the conservative media
[12:19.160 --> 12:26.640]  that parrots them? Where is the discussion about parental child endangerment? Taking
[12:26.640 --> 12:31.520]  these children on a very dangerous journey. Perhaps taking this child on this journey
[12:31.520 --> 12:37.040]  even when the child was sick. Maybe the child got sick as part of the journey, I don't know.
[12:37.040 --> 12:42.720]  But the child was taken into custody one day and died the next. So he probably came across
[12:42.720 --> 12:48.480]  the border sick. Yeah, well, if we talk about vetting the people who are coming across the
[12:48.480 --> 12:52.080]  border, people that we don't know anything about, we don't even know if these children
[12:52.080 --> 12:57.960]  are in the company of their parents or if it's somebody else that is bringing them across.
[12:57.960 --> 13:06.320]  If they've been brought over by child traffickers or kidnapped. And so the parentage needs to
[13:06.320 --> 13:10.800]  be discussed there. But they talk about Ellis Island all the time. Ellis Island, the people
[13:10.800 --> 13:13.560]  that would come in there would be quarantined for quite some time to make sure they weren't
[13:13.560 --> 13:19.280]  bringing diseases into the country. This child was sick when he came in. We don't know what
[13:19.280 --> 13:24.320]  he had. He was initially diagnosed by hospital staff for the common cold. Evaluated for release,
[13:24.320 --> 13:27.440]  they said, and then they found a fever. They brought him back in after giving him some
[13:27.440 --> 13:33.080]  antibiotics, amoxicillin, ibuprofen for fever and so forth. And then he suddenly died. They
[13:33.080 --> 13:39.440]  still don't know what was wrong with the child. And yet, if you look at all the headlines,
[13:39.440 --> 13:45.840]  they make it out, they imply that he was murdered by our policies, murdered by our border, murdered
[13:45.840 --> 13:54.040]  by our border patrol. Nothing could be further from the truth. It was child endangerment.
[13:54.040 --> 13:59.120]  And it is very sad to see this being given a pass. You know, we had the situation just
[13:59.120 --> 14:04.920]  a little over a year ago. So much hepatitis in San Diego, right there at the border, that
[14:04.920 --> 14:11.800]  they were washing the streets with bleach. This is underreported side effect of immigration
[14:11.800 --> 14:17.080]  and that is the health issues. So what about our children? When other children are brought
[14:17.080 --> 14:23.560]  in sick, we don't have any ability to quarantine or to vet these children? That's what the
[14:23.560 --> 14:30.200]  liberals don't want. This is not about a wall. This is about having a border. The wall is
[14:30.200 --> 14:34.640]  one aspect of it. But these are the same people who say, you don't need a wall. Wall is not
[14:34.640 --> 14:40.600]  effective. These are the same people who want to abolish ICE as well. So once the people
[14:40.600 --> 14:44.640]  get in, once they get past Border Patrol, and Border Patrol is intercepting enough
[14:44.640 --> 14:51.080]  people that it amounts to more than a caravan a week that are coming in, bits and pieces.
[14:51.080 --> 14:54.680]  Those are just the people that they intercept, the people that they don't intercept. Oh,
[14:54.680 --> 14:59.880]  they don't want them taken away by ICE. And they don't want anybody inspected for whether
[14:59.880 --> 15:05.520]  or not they are criminals or whether they have any diseases. None of that. We just leave
[15:05.520 --> 15:10.480]  the borders open. And as we look at the open borders, one of the things that's been sold
[15:10.480 --> 15:16.640]  to us for this, we had the UN selling us back around 2000 saying you have to open up your
[15:16.640 --> 15:22.640]  borders because the Ponzi schemes that we've set up everywhere, you've got an aging population
[15:22.640 --> 15:26.560]  and you're not going to have your social security. So we have to bring in people from other countries.
[15:26.560 --> 15:31.640]  And now it's reached peak absurdity. We now have a study from the American Enterprise
[15:31.640 --> 15:37.320]  Institute, a guy there named Lyman Stone, who's looking at our aging population. And
[15:37.320 --> 15:40.840]  the Ponzi scheme lie that social security has always been. He says, I got an idea. What
[15:40.840 --> 15:44.880]  we could do is we could give people credits if they have children based on the amount
[15:44.880 --> 15:49.680]  of money that their children are adding back into the economy. It's like, well, that used
[15:49.680 --> 15:54.880]  to be called families. We used to have things called families. Why is it that the population
[15:54.880 --> 15:59.240]  is declining like that? We'll talk about that when we come back. Stay with us.
[15:59.240 --> 16:04.600]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[16:04.600 --> 16:09.720]  the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of
[16:09.720 --> 16:16.440]  Empire shows that World Wars one and two left England broken. Its former colony, the U.S.
[16:16.440 --> 16:22.200]  had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began
[16:22.200 --> 16:29.360]  with World War one, the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.

[19:00.600 --> 19:04.560]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above
[19:04.560 --> 19:10.960]  the law. If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact
[19:10.960 --> 19:16.640]  that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS if game over. But if you look at everybody
[19:16.640 --> 19:20.840]  else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they
[19:20.840 --> 19:26.640]  are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted. There's only two groups
[19:26.640 --> 19:33.160]  in the U.S. Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com that are truly independent. And of course
[19:33.160 --> 19:37.640]  they're two of the dominant media forces in the world. It really is amazing. That's
[19:37.640 --> 19:42.280]  why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're
[19:42.280 --> 19:45.800]  all in and how far we've come together. Just remind you that you are the power, you're
[19:45.800 --> 19:52.040]  the strength, you're the will of Infowars. So please spread the links. Infowars.com,

[19:56.040 --> 20:03.640]  no one else will. We're all in each other's hands. God bless you all and thank you.
[20:03.640 --> 20:19.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:33.640 --> 20:44.720]  Welcome back. It's 104 years since peace broke out between the Germans and the British at
[20:44.720 --> 20:50.400]  the beginning of World War I. It was the first Christmas since the war had started. And the
[20:50.400 --> 20:54.800]  generals made sure that would never happen again. Now you remember the story. There was
[20:54.800 --> 21:01.160]  a German tenor from the Berlin Opera. He started singing Silent Night, first in German then
[21:01.160 --> 21:06.920]  in English. He was joined by other people as a New American recounts the story. It was
[21:06.920 --> 21:13.640]  on Christmas Eve 1914. Troops and the trenches of both sides began singing Christmas carols,
[21:13.640 --> 21:17.200]  with the trenches on the opposing sides frequently being close enough that troops on either side
[21:17.200 --> 21:21.840]  could hear each other. First one side would sing a carol, then the other side would, and
[21:21.840 --> 21:28.720]  then singing carols at both sides often recognized like Silent Night, Holy Night, or others.
[21:28.720 --> 21:33.640]  And as one historian pointed out, it was impromptu. Nobody had planned it. And if it hadn't been
[21:33.640 --> 21:38.720]  for a shared culture, certainly there would have been no Christmas truth, truce. Maybe
[21:38.720 --> 21:43.320]  it was also a shared religion for a lot of these people. Nevertheless, they said the
[21:43.320 --> 21:48.400]  guy came forward. He sang Silent Night, shooting stopped. And in that silence, he sang and
[21:48.400 --> 21:52.520]  the British knew the song and sang back. The morning after the singing took place, soldiers
[21:52.520 --> 21:57.720]  from both sides wished each other a very Christmas. They made arrangements to have a truce. Soldiers
[21:57.720 --> 22:01.600]  then emerged from the trenches, traded gifts with each other, kicked around soccer balls,
[22:01.600 --> 22:05.800]  buried their dead. It's rumored that even one British soldier got a haircut from a guy
[22:05.800 --> 22:11.120]  that was a German barber before the war. It's estimated that as many, this is the key thing,
[22:11.120 --> 22:18.560]  how big this got. It kept spreading. It says rich man's war, poor man's fight. That's pretty
[22:18.560 --> 22:23.320]  much the way it is every one of these wars, isn't it? It's estimated that as many as two
[22:23.320 --> 22:28.360]  thirds of the troops on the front lines, nearly 100,000 men participated in the truce, sometimes
[22:28.360 --> 22:35.840]  continuing it for many, many days. The generals got very angry. They got them fighting again.
[22:35.840 --> 22:40.240]  And then they sent out word that if you ever do anything like that again, there's going
[22:40.240 --> 22:45.920]  to be very severe penalties for fraternizing with the enemy. And we're kind of seeing something
[22:45.920 --> 22:52.880]  like that right now, the pushback. As President Trump said, we won. Let's enjoy a little bit
[22:52.880 --> 22:59.560]  of peace. Maybe we should secure our borders here instead of continuing to push for regime
[22:59.560 --> 23:03.200]  change. And of course, they're not saying it's regime change anymore. They're very open
[23:03.200 --> 23:10.600]  about that. Under Obama, you had the National Security Council. You had Hillary Clinton.
[23:10.600 --> 23:14.640]  You had John McCain saying, look, Hillary and the National Security Council, they demanded
[23:14.640 --> 23:22.080]  that Obama fund and arm ISIS so we could get Assad out of there. And Obama's just not
[23:22.080 --> 23:29.320]  doing it. Well, did he do it? Or did they do it for him? It was done. And we saw McCain
[23:29.320 --> 23:34.040]  meeting with ISIS. We saw these people prolonging the war. But now it's not about regime change
[23:34.040 --> 23:35.040]  anymore.
[23:35.040 --> 23:42.480]  No, now we've got, let's see, what is the excuse of the week? The mission creep? Oh, we got
[23:42.480 --> 23:48.040]  to stay there to keep the Iranians under control. Well, you've got the Saudis for that. You've
[23:48.040 --> 23:56.200]  also got the Israelis for that. We've got to fight ISIS. Now we've got to do the Iranian
[23:56.200 --> 24:02.320]  thing. Now they're going to come up with some reason to keep this going forever. There is
[24:02.320 --> 24:07.200]  friend of terrorists, John McCain. They admitted it. They admitted that they were funding the
[24:07.200 --> 24:13.240]  terrorists. Many times they said that. It was General Flynn who told us in 2015 that
[24:13.240 --> 24:18.560]  they had armed ISIS, that they'd made a conscious decision to do that. That's one of the reasons
[24:18.560 --> 24:23.280]  why President Trump selected him. And it's why they got him out immediately and replaced
[24:23.280 --> 24:29.480]  him with McMaster. We're seeing now what we said at the very beginning. That was what
[24:29.480 --> 24:35.040]  was happening. Now it's been proven that they had absolutely no reason to take him out.
[24:35.040 --> 24:40.320]  It was all a trumped up charge, if you will, to control the Trump administration. And yet
[24:40.320 --> 24:45.680]  now we have a lot of people running fear stories about how ISIS is not finished. I mean, even
[24:45.680 --> 24:49.840]  some of the conservative media, even I've seen even stories in Breitbart. Oh, you know,
[24:49.840 --> 24:54.000]  Matt, he's great. He knows what he's doing. He's the adult in the room and so forth. And
[24:54.000 --> 25:00.280]  we've got to still worry about ISIS. The interesting thing was that President Trump
[25:00.280 --> 25:05.840]  was talking to John Bolton. This is reported by even the mainstream media. They're trying
[25:05.840 --> 25:12.160]  to get Erdogan of Turkey to keep the Turkish troops back.
[25:12.160 --> 25:17.600]  And Erdogan said, why are you even there? ISIS is gone. And Trump asked John Bolton
[25:17.600 --> 25:24.360]  who is there. Is that true? Is ISIS 99% gone like Erdogan of Turkey says? And he says,
[25:24.360 --> 25:28.720]  yes, Mr. President, that's true. And he says, well, why are we there? We need to get out
[25:28.720 --> 25:33.640]  of there. So for a week they pushed back against it. Then you had Brett McGurk, the guy who
[25:33.640 --> 25:38.560]  held the press conference, and said, we're going to be there indefinitely. And started
[25:38.560 --> 25:41.440]  coming up with some new reasons why we had to stay there forever, just like they want
[25:41.440 --> 25:47.200]  to stay in Afghanistan forever. He's the guy who, over the weekend, very publicly quit
[25:47.200 --> 25:54.720]  as well as Mattis. And yet, as I'd reported, the Russians' flights over Syria fighting
[25:54.720 --> 26:03.040]  ISIS and so forth had dropped from between 100 to 104 per day to two to four per week.
[26:03.040 --> 26:10.400]  So yeah, it's very well known that that was the case. Certainly, Mattis has other alternative
[26:10.400 --> 26:15.280]  motivations here as well. We had, if you remember, just two or three months ago, I know it's
[26:15.280 --> 26:19.480]  hard for people to remember the news cycle, so much stuff is happening. Remember when
[26:19.480 --> 26:26.280]  Woodward's book came out, Fear? Remember when Mattis was trash talking President Trump,
[26:26.280 --> 26:29.520]  saying he has a mentality and understanding of a six-year-old or something to that effect?
[26:29.520 --> 26:35.760]  And they said, I didn't say that, and President Trump said, he's kind of a Democrat. Well,
[26:35.760 --> 26:44.880]  prior to that, going back to May of last year, another four or five months earlier than that,
[26:44.880 --> 26:50.200]  you had Mattis sending around nondisclosure agreements to various political consultants
[26:50.200 --> 26:58.640]  in Washington, D.C. The documents were exposed the end of last week by Gateway Pundit, asking
[26:58.640 --> 27:04.280]  what they thought about Mattis running for president against President Trump in 2020.
[27:04.280 --> 27:08.880]  And they said, well, he's got very good, you know, people like him, favorable ratings
[27:08.880 --> 27:14.520]  and so forth, but it might be problematic for him to run against the guy that he's serving.
[27:14.520 --> 27:20.280]  So he might want to wait until 2024 or unless something changes, like if he were to get
[27:20.280 --> 27:25.840]  out of the administration. And now he's had a very public break both with the trash talking
[27:25.840 --> 27:31.800]  and Woodward's book, and now with the trash talking that's going on, with the pullout
[27:31.800 --> 27:38.760]  of Syria. So now he's positioned himself to run in 2020.
[27:38.760 --> 27:42.120]  So did you even know when we look at this and we talk about what's going on the border
[27:42.120 --> 27:46.480]  and we're constantly told there's no authority to protect our border? There's no money to
[27:46.480 --> 27:49.640]  protect our border. We have to worry about the troops. Are they going to come home for
[27:49.640 --> 27:54.560]  Christmas? Are they going to come home for Thanksgiving? We were told. Did you know that
[27:54.560 --> 28:00.400]  we were occupying a third of Syria? Did you know that we had not 500, but anywhere from
[28:00.400 --> 28:04.560]  up to 4000, they said now we're hearing that they're going to bring 2000 home. I hope they're
[28:04.560 --> 28:09.640]  not leaving 2000 behind. But they have them in a very dangerous position there surrounded
[28:09.640 --> 28:16.040]  on all sides by hostile forces, although it's not as dangerous as it was before. But where
[28:16.040 --> 28:20.840]  did they get all the money for that? How did they build a dozen military bases in the third
[28:20.840 --> 28:26.080]  of Syria that they're occupying? It's an area the size of Louisiana. They built a dozen
[28:26.080 --> 28:31.320]  military bases. They built four airfields. Where did they get all the money for that?
[28:31.320 --> 28:36.200]  How did they build it so quickly? You know, if we even get the money to build a wall,
[28:36.200 --> 28:41.680]  $23 million per mile, they will take a decade or more to ever build it, even if they do
[28:41.680 --> 28:46.400]  fund it. They really ought to bring the military home, have the military, they can build those
[28:46.400 --> 28:51.160]  military bases, do it quickly, do it quietly without you even knowing it. Using the money
[28:51.160 --> 28:55.440]  that we have to protect our country, use that at the border. President Trump has the authority
[28:55.440 --> 29:01.120]  and the duty to do exactly that. Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[29:01.120 --> 29:06.800]  Want revenge on the common housefly? Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come

[33:25.400 --> 33:38.200]  Welcome back. Let's talk about that other Christmas holiday, Festivus, for the rest of us. From
[33:38.200 --> 33:45.160]  the Seinfeld episode, of course, completely made a holiday that is caught on with people
[33:45.160 --> 33:51.880]  having fun, especially Rand Paul. Every year he has a great series of tweets, says, here's
[33:51.880 --> 33:58.280]  my grievances, and very funny, especially this year, but to the point about war and many
[33:58.280 --> 34:03.200]  other issues. And of course, a part of Festivus was airing your grievances, you know, nailing
[34:03.200 --> 34:07.120]  them to this, I guess, aluminum tree or whatever that they had. Here's some of the tweets that
[34:07.120 --> 34:12.120]  Rand Paul put out. He said, my friend Lindsey Graham is a bit mad right now. You see, he's
[34:12.120 --> 34:18.440]  never had a war end before. He's going to have to console himself with the fact that
[34:18.440 --> 34:23.200]  we're still in about eight more. I know it'll be hard for him, but I think he'll get by.
[34:23.200 --> 34:27.360]  And I have to tell you, I haven't seen a senator who loves this war this much since
[34:27.360 --> 34:33.320]  the Star Wars prequels. And he has a picture of Senator Palpatine, which may be the alter
[34:33.320 --> 34:38.680]  ego of Lindsey Graham, quite frankly. He says, well, actually, let's talk about John Bolton.
[34:38.680 --> 34:42.400]  I don't have a grievance. I just really want, would have liked to have been there in the
[34:42.400 --> 34:47.400]  room when POTUS told him to end the war. And that's what I was talking about before. He's
[34:47.400 --> 34:52.280]  on the phone with the president of Turkey. Bolton is telling President Trump, tell him
[34:52.280 --> 34:56.640]  to back off. Tell him, he's there in Syria. He shouldn't be in Syria. We should be in
[34:56.640 --> 35:02.600]  Syria. We should control a third of the country. When we have that discussion as a people,
[35:02.600 --> 35:07.800]  I don't recall that. And as I pointed out before, did you know that they had the time
[35:07.800 --> 35:14.080]  and the money to build a dozen military bases, American military bases there in Syria for
[35:14.080 --> 35:18.280]  airfields? How much did that cost? Who knows? We're not allowed to know. We weren't even
[35:18.280 --> 35:24.240]  told that we had thousands of troops there. They were telling us we had 500. We had a
[35:24.240 --> 35:28.680]  couple of, we had Washington Post, I think it was, let it slip that we had 4,000 there.
[35:28.680 --> 35:33.840]  Now we're told there's 2,000. Who knows? All the stuff is kept secret from us. Everything
[35:33.840 --> 35:38.920]  in your life is an open book to these people. They can figure out where you're going to
[35:38.920 --> 35:47.600]  go have lunch today. But you can't know about massive wars that they're starting. Nevertheless,
[35:47.600 --> 35:51.840]  yeah, it was John Bolton there and he said, I would have liked to have been there when
[35:51.840 --> 35:56.720]  POTUS told him the end of the war. Because as he's talking to the President of Turkey,
[35:56.720 --> 36:00.800]  the President of Turkey says, you know ISIS is gone. Why are you still there? And Trump
[36:00.800 --> 36:08.800]  says to Bolton, is that true? And Bolton says, yes it is. Pompeo knows it. Mattis knows
[36:08.800 --> 36:13.840]  it. I know it. All the war mongers know it. Yeah, they're gone. Okay, why, we're gonna
[36:13.840 --> 36:18.040]  leave too. And then they work for a week to try to stop it. Anyway, Rand Paul says, how
[36:18.040 --> 36:22.080]  many times do you think he made the President repeat it? Because he didn't even know what
[36:22.080 --> 36:27.840]  the words meant, end the war, end the war. We've had this situation before. Remember
[36:27.840 --> 36:32.120]  when President Trump started talking about bringing troops home once before? And remember
[36:32.120 --> 36:39.240]  the response from the Pentagon? They said, well, we really don't know what he means
[36:39.240 --> 36:43.880]  by that. And we don't know how to do that. We have to have some kind of plan for how
[36:43.880 --> 36:48.080]  to bring them home. I don't know about that. Have you ever heard that kind of discussion
[36:48.080 --> 36:54.160]  when it was the other way around? You ever hear any reluctance or any, we gotta have
[36:54.160 --> 37:00.320]  a plan, discussions when we inject troops into a foreign country for regime change?
[37:00.320 --> 37:10.520]  No, never, never. But they pretend even though they can deploy everywhere without any notification
[37:10.520 --> 37:16.920]  and do it almost instantaneously. And it's a good thing that they can if they're needed.
[37:16.920 --> 37:21.240]  But we don't need our Pentagon to do that without having a discussion about whether
[37:21.240 --> 37:26.120]  or not we should have a war. That is something that the Congress should be doing before we
[37:26.120 --> 37:31.880]  deploy the troops. The public should be aware of it. We should have a plan for when we go
[37:31.880 --> 37:36.720]  to war. We should have a reason for when we go to war.
[37:36.720 --> 37:43.160]  We're talking about Christmas time here. The tradition, the Christmas tradition for a just
[37:43.160 --> 37:50.120]  war for Christian countries was always the precondition that we were attacked, that we
[37:50.120 --> 37:54.680]  don't go to war when we weren't attacked. That's why there was so much resistance against
[37:54.680 --> 37:58.760]  our involvement in World War I. That's why people were resistant to get involved in World
[37:58.760 --> 38:03.960]  War II. But of course, George H.W. Bush on the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, which
[38:03.960 --> 38:09.160]  again, FDR stepped back. He knew that they were massing for that attack. He wanted to
[38:09.160 --> 38:13.760]  invite that attack. Perhaps he didn't know it was going to be as severe as it was, but
[38:13.760 --> 38:19.600]  he wanted them to strike first. So we would have justification to go to war. And George
[38:19.600 --> 38:26.720]  H.W. Bush on the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor said the people to blame for that were
[38:26.720 --> 38:32.400]  not the Japanese. It was the America First people. They were flying escort, said George
[38:32.400 --> 38:38.000]  H.W. Bush. They were flying escort with the bombers. But he didn't blame the Japanese.
[38:38.000 --> 38:43.400]  Japanese were friends. They were going to be part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[38:43.400 --> 38:47.960]  So anyway, Rand Paul goes on to say, I posed John Bolton being hired, but I really can't
[38:47.960 --> 38:53.080]  think of anything that makes me happier than thinking of him having to end wars for the
[38:53.080 --> 38:59.360]  rest of his time in the White House. Let's hope that's the case. Rand Paul went on to
[38:59.360 --> 39:05.680]  say he was opposed to appropriating more money for a border wall, unless there's a good way
[39:05.680 --> 39:09.680]  to fund it. But he said, I've got a good way to fund it. We promise to spend less money,
[39:09.680 --> 39:14.840]  so I won't vote for it. But we are spending $50 billion a year in Afghanistan. We should
[39:14.840 --> 39:20.240]  have declared victory there years ago. I think we should come home and out of that $50 billion
[39:20.240 --> 39:26.200]  in savings, I think we would have enough for border wall and security.
[39:26.200 --> 39:34.600]  And quite frankly, folks, if we have a Department of Defense that demands that we have secret
[39:34.600 --> 39:40.120]  wars, that demands that we occupy and invade other countries forever, because that's what
[39:40.120 --> 39:49.080]  they're talking about in both Syria and Afghanistan. And yet, they refuse to defend this country.
[39:49.080 --> 39:55.760]  That's the point at which we need to understand that this whole thing is a sham. And so he's
[39:55.760 --> 39:57.680]  absolutely right to call for that to come home.
[39:57.680 --> 40:00.520]  And they're still saying the same thing. In the past, when President Trump said we need
[40:00.520 --> 40:06.760]  to start bringing some of these troops home, stand down from putting them in danger, start
[40:06.760 --> 40:10.920]  to protect our country, they say we don't know how to do it. And they're saying it again
[40:10.920 --> 40:11.920]  now.
[40:11.920 --> 40:15.120]  Look at the headlines from the Daily Mail. Top Marine reveals chaos inside the Pentagon.
[40:15.120 --> 40:19.480]  Over Trump's Syria and Afghanistan, pullout orders telling combat troops, I don't think
[40:19.480 --> 40:23.840]  anybody really knows exactly what's going to happen. Have you ever heard them say that
[40:23.840 --> 40:28.960]  about deployment? Well, President Obama has ordered us to go into Syria. I don't really
[40:28.960 --> 40:31.440]  know how we're going to do that. Do we have any authority to do that? Where are we going
[40:31.440 --> 40:37.560]  to get the money to do that? What's the mission? I don't know. No, you never hear that when
[40:37.560 --> 40:42.680]  they get injected into Syria, but you pull them out of Syria. I don't know. I can't answer
[40:42.680 --> 40:47.080]  the troops' questions. There's no timelines. We don't have detailed orders. All we got
[40:47.080 --> 40:53.080]  is tweets. Well, we didn't even have tweets from Obama when they put the troops in. Where
[40:53.080 --> 40:56.040]  did they get that information? How'd that get to them?
[40:56.040 --> 41:06.840]  Do you remember when we had Leon Panetta and Jeff Sessions going back and forth about whether
[41:06.840 --> 41:12.320]  they were going to put troops in Syria? And how would they start that? Well, we had Leon
[41:12.320 --> 41:15.560]  Panetta. I'm going to play that clip for you in a moment here, but let's go to the one
[41:15.560 --> 41:22.480]  with Leon Panetta with Chris Wallace on Fox News. Here's Leon Panetta criticizing President
[41:22.480 --> 41:27.560]  Trump saying it's just too much chaos. It's chaos. These people have been creating chaos
[41:27.560 --> 41:33.400]  everywhere around the globe. Remember, get smart. You have the two different sides, control
[41:33.400 --> 41:39.200]  and chaos. They are the chaos side. They're not the control side. But here he is on Fox
[41:39.200 --> 41:41.240]  News with Chris Wallace.
[41:41.240 --> 41:46.240]  Talk about the national security component of it first in your last job as Secretary
[41:46.240 --> 41:52.080]  of Defense. We have had these abrupt shifts in policy, pulling out of Syria, drawing down
[41:52.080 --> 41:58.360]  an Afghanistan, the resignation of Defense Secretary Mattis. But President Trump did campaign
[41:58.360 --> 42:04.080]  saying he did not want to be engaged in these endless wars. In that sense, doesn't he keep
[42:04.080 --> 42:06.160]  being a campaign promise?
[42:06.160 --> 42:14.560]  Well, the question the President has to decide is whether he upholds his oath of office as
[42:14.560 --> 42:20.080]  President of the United States to protect our security or whether he's simply going to
[42:20.080 --> 42:25.960]  move forward and fulfill campaign promises. I think the more important responsibility is
[42:25.960 --> 42:33.240]  to protect this country and protect our security. And that should come first. A lot of presidents
[42:33.240 --> 42:38.760]  make campaign promises. But when they become President of the United States, their primary
[42:38.760 --> 42:41.280]  responsibility is to protect our country.
[42:41.280 --> 42:45.960]  That's right. To protect our country. That's what he's trying to do with a wall. And to
[42:45.960 --> 42:51.600]  obey the Constitution. And when we come back, I'm going to flash back to 2012, when Leon
[42:51.600 --> 42:57.400]  Panetta was just in the face of Jeff Sessions about that very thing.
[42:57.400 --> 43:05.920]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember, this life is a test. And those of you that
[43:05.920 --> 43:10.200]  have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism
[43:10.200 --> 43:14.720]  and Christianity coming back from the dead and recognizing it's being persecuted, that's
[43:14.720 --> 43:19.720]  all because you are the core, listening to M4 Wars around the world, the eyes and ears
[43:19.720 --> 43:28.680]  of liberty that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming. Everybody knows
[43:28.680 --> 43:33.880]  who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians who tend to be immune to the globalist
[43:33.880 --> 43:38.720]  brainwashing and who tend to see it. And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[43:38.720 --> 43:44.920]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying. 2018 has been insane. 2019 is going to be
[43:44.920 --> 43:51.120]  the big decision maker and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me. Not behind
[43:51.120 --> 43:54.400]  us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists. So
[43:54.400 --> 43:59.440]  whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute you.
[43:59.440 --> 44:04.880]  You realize that when you spread the links from M4 Wars.com, when you spread the videos,
[44:04.880 --> 44:10.840]  you are changing the world. It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalist. It
[44:10.840 --> 44:15.400]  is you, the M4 Warriors across the planet that stood against the bullying, that stood
[44:15.400 --> 44:19.280]  against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats that have now changed the world.
[44:19.280 --> 44:24.160]  And that's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us and spreading the word.
[44:24.160 --> 44:28.640]  You are the M4 War. And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important
[44:28.640 --> 44:34.520]  than ever that everyone go to M4 Wars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email
[44:34.520 --> 44:39.440]  so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking
[44:39.440 --> 44:44.840]  news, intel, you name it. And so now I ask you more than ever to share the M4 Wars.com
[44:44.840 --> 44:49.120]  articles, to share the videos, to tell people by the local stations you're listening to.
[44:49.120 --> 44:54.600]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at M4Wars.com forward
[44:54.600 --> 45:00.440]  slash newsletter. We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[45:00.440 --> 45:04.520]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[45:04.520 --> 45:10.800]  law. If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact
[45:10.800 --> 45:16.480]  that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over. But if you look at everybody
[45:16.480 --> 45:20.680]  else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they
[45:20.680 --> 45:26.480]  are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted. There's only two groups
[45:26.480 --> 45:32.760]  in the U.S., M4 Wars and Matt Drudge of Drudge Report.com that are truly independent. And
[45:32.760 --> 45:37.400]  of course there are two of the dominant media forces in the world. It really is amazing.
[45:37.400 --> 45:41.960]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight
[45:41.960 --> 45:45.600]  we're all in and how far we've come together. Just remind you that you are the power, you're
[45:45.600 --> 45:53.040]  the strength, you're the will of M4 Wars. So please spread the links, M4Wars.com, NewsWars.com,
[45:53.040 --> 45:57.560]  PrisonPotter.com because if you don't spread the articles in the videos, no one else will.
[45:57.560 --> 46:00.480]  We're all in each other's hands. God bless you all and thank you.
[46:00.480 --> 46:05.720]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[46:05.720 --> 46:09.960]  That's the globalist only hope. So when you support M4 Wars, when you spread our articles
[46:09.960 --> 46:14.680]  and videos, when you buy products at M4Wars.com, you are literally not just supporting M4 Wars
[46:14.680 --> 46:19.400]  in free speech and standing in defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people,
[46:19.400 --> 46:24.480]  but you are standing for your own future and your own best shot of having an early warning
[46:24.480 --> 46:27.120]  system in America to stand against these individuals.
[46:27.120 --> 46:31.240]  When you order products at M4Wars.com, you fund not just an American revolution, but
[46:31.240 --> 46:35.680]  a global revolution against tyranny. And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout
[46:35.680 --> 46:40.560]  to the end of the year as part of a total store clearance. Every order gets a free
[46:40.560 --> 46:45.680]  t-shirt. Every order gets free shipping. Every order gets 50% to 75% off in total clearance
[46:45.680 --> 46:51.440]  and that funding allows us to go into the new year on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout
[46:51.440 --> 46:55.840]  the first part of the year to not just fight, but to expand. We're on the march, the empire's
[46:55.840 --> 47:03.560]  on the run. I salute you all. Now please take action at M4Store.com.
[47:03.560 --> 47:31.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:31.000 --> 47:35.680]  Welcome back. So we have the general saying, I really have no idea what we're doing, how
[47:35.680 --> 47:40.440]  to get out of Syria. I have no plan, no orders. I don't know what's going on here. Again,
[47:40.440 --> 47:45.280]  did you ever hear them say that about going into Syria? We weren't even told how many
[47:45.280 --> 47:52.120]  troops we had in there. At one point, the biggest number we'd seen was 500 until just
[47:52.120 --> 47:56.240]  a couple of weeks ago as they began saying, oh, we've got a big presence there. They started
[47:56.240 --> 48:00.520]  admitting in the back pages of mainstream media, the Washington Post, New York, and others
[48:00.520 --> 48:04.680]  saying, we've got about 4,000 troops there. We're occupying about a third of the country,
[48:04.680 --> 48:10.360]  about the size of Louisiana, and we're going to be there forever, said Brett McGurk. Because
[48:10.360 --> 48:16.320]  at that point, President Trump already was onto the fact that ISIS was gone, and they
[48:16.320 --> 48:22.080]  were trying to put him in a difficult position, make him look like he's soft on ISIS. And
[48:22.080 --> 48:28.600]  that is the approach that they're now taking. And you heard Leon Panetta, former Secretary
[48:28.600 --> 48:34.240]  of Defense, and of course, also former CIA director, former congressman, who sworn oath
[48:34.240 --> 48:39.360]  to the Constitution, as Jeff Sessions reminded him back in 2012, when they were talking about
[48:39.360 --> 48:46.040]  Syria, when they were talking about whether or not they would send troops into Syria.
[48:46.040 --> 48:51.040]  And I want to play for you this back and forth between Panetta and Jeff Sessions at the time.
[48:51.040 --> 48:54.080]  Jeff Sessions was like, well, you would come to us and tell us if you're going to send
[48:54.080 --> 48:59.880]  them there, right? Well, I might tell you after we did it, we'd consult with our international
[48:59.880 --> 49:04.960]  allies, we'd talk to the UN, we'd talk to NATO, and so for that, we might tell you what's
[49:04.960 --> 49:05.960]  going on.
[49:05.960 --> 49:11.440]  Well, evidently, they didn't, because who knew that they had 2,000, 4,000 troops there?
[49:11.440 --> 49:16.120]  They put him there and they didn't even tell us. Here's the discussion six years ago, and
[49:16.120 --> 49:23.480]  I want you to see the arrogance of Leon Panetta, and also at the same time, how Jeff Sessions,
[49:23.480 --> 49:26.560]  even though he knew the right thing to do, was a little bit too timid to do anything
[49:26.560 --> 49:31.240]  about it, except just say, aw, shucks, and golly gee. Here are the two of them talking
[49:31.240 --> 49:35.120]  about whether or not we should go into Syria. Remember, we got a third of the country, 4,000
[49:35.120 --> 49:38.160]  troops there right now. Here they were six years ago.
[49:38.160 --> 49:44.920]  When it comes to the kind of military action where we want to build a coalition and work
[49:44.920 --> 49:50.000]  with our international partners, then obviously we would like to have some kind of legal basis
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.360]  on which to do it as we did in Libya.
[49:52.360 --> 49:54.360]  As we did in Libya. Oh, that was a success, wasn't it?
[49:54.360 --> 49:59.160]  Some sort of legal basis. We worried about international legal basis, but nobody worried
[49:59.160 --> 50:07.040]  about the fundamental constitutional legal basis that this Congress has over war. We
[50:07.040 --> 50:12.680]  were not asked, stunningly, in direct violation of the War Powers Act whether or not you believe
[50:12.680 --> 50:17.000]  it's constitution, it certainly didn't comply with it. We spent our time worrying about
[50:17.000 --> 50:22.800]  the UN, the Arab League, NATO, and too little time, in my opinion, worried about the elected
[50:22.800 --> 50:27.440]  representatives of the United States. Do you think that you can act without Congress
[50:27.440 --> 50:34.080]  to initiate a no-fly zone in Syria without congressional approval?
[50:34.080 --> 50:42.160]  You know, again, our goal would be to seek international permission, and we would come
[50:42.160 --> 50:48.920]  to the Congress and inform you and determine how best to approach this, whether or not
[50:48.920 --> 50:53.680]  we would want to get from the Congress. And then we might tell you.
[50:53.680 --> 50:57.000]  Issues we would have to discuss as we decide what to do here.
[50:57.000 --> 51:03.680]  Well, I'm almost breathless about that, because what I heard you say is we're going to seek
[51:03.680 --> 51:08.800]  international approval, and they will come and tell the Congress what we might do, and
[51:08.800 --> 51:13.880]  we might seek congressional approval. I want to just say to you, that's a big dish. When
[51:13.880 --> 51:21.200]  you agree, you served in the Congress, wouldn't you agree that that would be pretty breathtaking
[51:21.200 --> 51:25.280]  to the average American, so would you like to clarify that?
[51:25.280 --> 51:32.880]  I've also served with Republican presidents and Democratic presidents who has always reserved
[51:32.880 --> 51:36.760]  the right to defend this country if necessary.
[51:36.760 --> 51:40.680]  First one is at our borders. We're not going to do that. They don't reserve that right,
[51:40.680 --> 51:47.680]  even though the president has that right, and he has the duty to do that. We don't
[51:47.680 --> 51:52.200]  have a duty. There's nothing about defending ISIS when they take the oath of office. They're
[51:52.200 --> 51:57.960]  supposed to defend and obey the Constitution. And so he says, yeah, we will do that. And
[51:57.960 --> 52:02.080]  as Sessions said, well, that'll be pretty breathtaking for you to say that you're going
[52:02.080 --> 52:08.920]  to consult with NATO and with the UN, with our foreign allies, and you might, you might
[52:08.920 --> 52:09.920]  tell us.
[52:09.920 --> 52:15.800]  Well, guess what, Jeff? They didn't tell you. Maybe they did tell you, and you didn't
[52:15.800 --> 52:21.000]  tell the American people. If so, shame on you for that, because they just told everybody
[52:21.000 --> 52:25.480]  this last week, and they only mentioned it because they heard that President Trump was
[52:25.480 --> 52:30.120]  talking about coming out of Syria. That's the deception that these people have been
[52:30.120 --> 52:35.320]  involved in. And at the time, Newt Gingrich came out and criticized Panetta very strongly
[52:35.320 --> 52:36.320]  about that.
[52:36.320 --> 52:43.760]  That was back in March of 2012. Panetta later came on and said that Obama was wrong to not
[52:43.760 --> 52:50.280]  arm ISIS more. So he was there with the John McCain's and the Lindsey Graham's and the
[52:50.280 --> 52:53.120]  Hillary Clinton's and all these people. He was saying, well, we would follow the same
[52:53.120 --> 52:57.560]  patterns we did in Libya. Exactly. That's why we need to get out of there. We saw what
[52:57.560 --> 53:04.560]  happened with Libya. Now in Libya, they have the arms bizarre for ISIS. And if you recall,
[53:04.560 --> 53:09.800]  also going back into 2012, beginning of 2012, just as Hillary Clinton was about to leave
[53:09.800 --> 53:18.960]  because the disaster actually was a 2013 because it was later in that year, 2012, that you
[53:18.960 --> 53:22.600]  had the situation in Benghazi.
[53:22.600 --> 53:26.920]  And as Rand Paul was talking to Hillary Clinton about that, saying, what about all these arms
[53:26.920 --> 53:30.920]  that are being transferred out of Benghazi? And Hillary Clinton said, well, you'll need
[53:30.920 --> 53:36.960]  to talk to the agency that runs the annex there. In other words, the CIA, she wouldn't
[53:36.960 --> 53:43.920]  say you need to talk to the CIA. She kind of couched it back very cleverly. What a calculating
[53:43.920 --> 53:48.640]  witch she is because she knew what was going on with that. And we know what's happened
[53:48.640 --> 53:55.440]  with that is Rand Paul says it's become a big arms bizarre for ISIS and the wake of
[53:55.440 --> 54:02.960]  that disaster there in Libya, where she stood down, let people die, our own people die.
[54:02.960 --> 54:09.120]  Talk about national defense. They won't even defend their own personnel. Their own ambassador,
[54:09.120 --> 54:11.460]  they won't even defend.
[54:11.460 --> 54:18.880]  And now we have in Libya, we have open slave trading blocks there. They've resumed the
[54:18.880 --> 54:24.400]  slave trade. That's the kind of successful foreign policy that has come out of these
[54:24.400 --> 54:31.800]  secret wars where they never consult with us. And if you go back and you look at the
[54:31.800 --> 54:37.400]  letter that came from Mattis, as Matt Tiabi of Rolling Stones point out, he says, nothing
[54:37.400 --> 54:42.920]  unites the political class like the threat of ending our never ending wars. He said,
[54:42.920 --> 54:47.400]  what's the war on terror death count by now? A half million people? How much money have
[54:47.400 --> 54:53.640]  we spent? Five trillion, five and a half, six? For that cost, we have destabilized region
[54:53.640 --> 54:58.120]  to the point of abject chaos. There's your chaos, Panetta. He's saying, oh, it's total
[54:58.120 --> 55:03.440]  chaos in Washington because Trump wants to end these wars. No, you have created chaos
[55:03.440 --> 55:05.240]  worldwide.
[55:05.240 --> 55:09.520]  We have inspired millions of Muslims to hate us. We've torn up the Geneva Convention and
[55:09.520 --> 55:14.480]  half the Constitution in pursuit of policies like torture, kidnapping, assassination by
[55:14.480 --> 55:20.520]  robot and warrantless detention. Matt Tiabi goes on to say, unless Donald Trump decides
[55:20.520 --> 55:24.160]  to reverse his decision to begin withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan, cable news for
[55:24.160 --> 55:30.440]  the next few weeks is going to be one long scanner's marathon of exploding heads.
[55:30.440 --> 55:36.120]  And as an example here, he's got George W. Bush, former communications director. Today's
[55:36.120 --> 55:43.280]  decision will cheer Moscow, ISIS and Iran. Bill Crystal of the failing weekly standard
[55:43.280 --> 55:49.400]  spelled W-E-A-K-L-Y. Maybe Trump will bring Republicans and Democrats together, he said.
[55:49.400 --> 55:56.080]  He says, that's really what may happen. He said, prior to this point, he said, Crystal
[55:56.080 --> 56:00.040]  may be onto something. The Democrats' plan up until now was probably to impeach Trump
[56:00.040 --> 56:03.760]  in the White House using something that they could get out of some financial crimes. But
[56:03.760 --> 56:10.520]  he said the plan never had a chance to succeed in the Senate until now because now you've
[56:10.520 --> 56:15.440]  got Republicans like Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio, Ben Sasse, maybe Mitch McConnell ready
[56:15.440 --> 56:19.120]  to throw President Trump out because he's going to push back against the military industrial
[56:19.120 --> 56:27.000]  complex. And we'll talk more about this when we come back in the next segment. But he goes
[56:27.000 --> 56:34.240]  on to talk about Jim Mattis. He says his letter is now being celebrated like some kind of
[56:34.240 --> 56:37.840]  inspirational literature like the Gettysburg Address or whatever. Basically what Mattis
[56:37.840 --> 56:43.800]  was saying was exactly what you just heard Leon Panetta say years ago. We will consult
[56:43.800 --> 56:49.840]  with our allies. Mattis says, the core strength of our country are our foreign alliances.
[56:49.840 --> 56:55.920]  No, it isn't. Those entangling alliances are the things that are destroying this country
[56:55.920 --> 57:00.040]  as George Washington warned in his farewell address. He goes on to say, well, I don't
[57:00.040 --> 57:04.440]  want to be the policeman of the world. So we have NATO. Who do you think pays for NATO?
[57:04.440 --> 57:08.520]  We just had President Trump come back out and say, he's out there wanting us to stay
[57:08.520 --> 57:14.360]  in NATO. Let us do all the heavy lifting for these people. We are NATO. We are the policeman
[57:14.360 --> 57:19.600]  of the world. And yet we have no right to know what NATO is doing.
[57:19.600 --> 57:23.400]  All right, folks, we've got to take a quick break. Just to remind you, we have our end
[57:23.400 --> 57:31.640]  of store, end of year clearance sale at our store, infowarstore.com. Massive discounts.
[57:31.640 --> 57:35.960]  Take a look at the specials that we got there up to 75% off. We have free shipping storewide

[57:40.560 --> 57:49.480]  us.
[57:49.480 --> 57:53.520]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[57:53.520 --> 57:59.840]  law. If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact
[57:59.840 --> 58:05.520]  that the emperor has no clothes that can call BS, it's game over. But if you look at everybody
[58:05.520 --> 58:09.760]  else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they
[58:09.760 --> 58:15.520]  are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted. There's only two groups
[58:15.520 --> 58:22.160]  in the U.S. Infowars and Matt Drudge of drudgereport.com that are truly independent. And of course,
[58:22.160 --> 58:26.640]  they're two of the dominant media forces in the world. It really is amazing. That's why
[58:26.640 --> 58:31.320]  as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all
[58:31.320 --> 58:35.240]  in and how far we've come together. Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength,

[59:53.080 --> 01:00:00.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:09.200]  Live from the infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now,
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:21.960]  your host, David Knight. Welcome back, as I was just saying.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:28.000]  We have these, as Matt Diabia of Rolling Stones is saying, he's behind President Trump. Because
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:34.120]  we have seen how these wars have failed in every respect. It is not chaos that's coming
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:39.800]  from President Trump, it is chaos that's been brought to the world by our foreign policy,
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:44.800]  our failed foreign policy. And he said, up to this point, it looked like they were going
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:49.600]  to try to remove President Trump on some kind of financial crime entrapment. But now they
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:55.480]  might actually have the votes of the Republican establishment there. These senators are pushing
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:01:00.560]  back on it. People like Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio, Ben Sasse, Mitch McConnell and others.
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:06.600]  Talking about what Marco Rubio said as he is praising this letter from Jim Mattis that
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:12.920]  says that our core strength are our foreign alliances, our entangling alliances. It's
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:16.600]  the same kind of stuff that we hear from the left all the time. Our core strength of our
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:23.360]  country is our open borders and uncontrolled immigration. No, it isn't.
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:28.640]  And President Trump is trying to take those two weaknesses of our country, those entangling
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:33.360]  alliances and our open borders and do something about them in one stroke. Pull these things
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:38.520]  together. President Trump needs to understand that he has the authority, he has the money,
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:43.240]  he has the military troops to protect our border. If we can do all this stuff in Syria,
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:49.640]  we can do it at our border. They did it surreptitiously. They did it without even telling Congress as
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:56.800]  you just saw back in 2012. He's Leon Panetta is arrogantly boasting the session. Yeah,
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.560]  we'll talk to NATO, we'll talk to the other people. We might tell you if we're going to
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:00.560]  send troops to Syria.
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:03.360]  Now we find out they got thousands there. They control a third of the country. They built
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:08.160]  a dozen military bases there. Did they ever tell any of us any of that until they decided
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:13.840]  they're going to stay there forever? And they said that at that point in time, because they
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:17.680]  realized that President Trump was serious about moving out. That was after the conference
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:23.080]  call with Bolton and the President of Turkey and President Trump. President Trump said,
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:26.320]  is that right? ISIS is gone? Yeah, yeah, Mr. President, that's right. Well then, let's
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:27.320]  get out of there.
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:32.160]  And so that's when they started telling us how much they had there. But otherwise, they
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:39.080]  would have told us. And so Marco Rubio talking about that letter from Jim Mattis. He said,
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:43.240]  it makes it abundantly clear we're headed towards a series of grave policy errors which
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:48.000]  will endanger our nation, damage our alliances, and empower our adversaries. No, that's what
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:55.840]  you've been doing. That's what you've been doing for the last two decades, really. He
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:59.040]  says, you'll hear all sorts of arguments today about why withdrawals are bad. You'll hear
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:04.960]  that Trump has no plan. And that's true, maybe. Did they have a plan as to what they were
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:10.120]  going to do when they went to war? No. They just said, we're going to send some troops
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.120]  in.
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:16.080]  But now they don't know how to get them out. And so you've got the generals all saying,
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:20.520]  we don't know how to get our troops out of Syria. We don't know how to get them out of
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:27.040]  Afghanistan. Let's get them out. We can do it. It says, but we don't exactly have a plan
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:30.960]  for staying in the Middle East, either, beyond installing a permanent garrison in a dozen
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:36.160]  countries, sending buttloads of money and making ourselves permanently despised in the region
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:43.320]  as civilian deaths pile up through drone bombings and other so-called surgical actions.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:49.440]  And he quotes President Trump. Here's a guy writing for Rolling Stones. And he has distanced
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:55.840]  himself back and say, just as you heard many of them say about prison reform. While I don't
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:58.320]  typically like President Trump, but he's doing the right thing. Well, he's doing the right
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.000]  thing about this as well.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:07.200]  Prison reform, ending foreign forever wars. President Trump, he said, I don't think we
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.120]  should be nation building anymore. He said, in March of 2016, he said, I watched as we
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:14.320]  built schools in Iraq and they're blown up and we built another one and we get blown
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:20.560]  up. And he said, Trump was wrong about a thousand other things, says the Rolling Stones writer.
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:26.480]  But this was true. I had done a story about how military contractors spent $72 million
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:31.480]  on what was supposed to be an Iraqi police academy and they delivered a pile of rubble
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:35.760]  that was so unusable, pedestrians made it into a toilet. The special inspector general
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:40.200]  for Iraqi construction said, we witnessed a light fixture so full of diluted urine and
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:45.360]  feces that it wouldn't operate. And that's what they found in Afghanistan as well. All
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:49.360]  right, stay with us. We're still going to talk about what's going on with the green
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:53.880]  new deal. That's the red and green that's being offered to us by the Democrats. It'll
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:58.360]  make you see red and it'll make our balance sheet go red as well. We'll be right back.
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:02.400]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:08.720]  law. If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:14.400]  that the emperor has no clothes that can call BS, it's game over. But if you look at everybody
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:18.600]  else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:24.400]  are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted. There's only two groups
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:31.080]  in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of drudgereport.com that are truly independent. And of course,
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:35.520]  they're two of the dominant media forces in the world. It really is amazing. That's why
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:40.160]  as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:44.080]  in and how far we've come together. Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength,
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:52.200]  you're the will of Infowars. So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswars.com, christenpana.com.
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:55.800]  Because if you don't spread the articles in the videos, no one else will. We're all in
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:15.800]  each other's hands. God bless you all and thank you.
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:32.720]  Yes, the complaining in Washington has now escalated to a new level. And as we see President
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:38.800]  Trump staying behind in the White House, it kind of reminds me of that other movie, Christmas
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:47.440]  time movie, Home Alone. And I think somebody needs to do a re-envisioning of this instead
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:52.520]  of having the burglars that are trying to break into the house that Macaulay Culkin
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:58.080]  is in. I think maybe we have President Trump and you've got all these two dozen or so President
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:04.040]  wannabes who are trying to get into the White House and you have them trying to break into
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:08.280]  the White House and have President Trump dumping stuff on them. Like the truth maybe
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:14.080]  about that. But yeah, just re-do that movie and change the heads. Maybe we'll get somebody.
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:18.200]  Maybe Derrick Brink could do that. He could do a great job of that. Yeah, Home Alone.
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:22.360]  And we'll talk a little bit more about what President Trump had to say in the White House
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:27.480]  as he was talking to people about Santa Claus and other fantasies like the Federal Reserve
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:30.840]  and quantitative easing. We'll get to that in just a few minutes.
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:38.560]  But I want to talk again about the amazing pushback from the establishment. As Matt
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:45.080]  Tiabio Rolling Stone said, nothing unifies both political parties other than putting
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:49.720]  an end to our forever wars. And you can see this. Look at some of the reactions that he's
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:55.480]  pulled together here. There is absolutely no President, said a Europe scholar. That's
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:08:01.120]  what his title is from a Brookings Institute, Thomas Wright from the Brookings Institute.
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:05.760]  Then another, a former CIA official for both George W. Bush and Obama, Patrick Skinner,
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:11.760]  said the open disdain that Trump has shown for the agencies is unprecedented. This is
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:16.040]  the kind of stuff that they're pushing out there.
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:21.960]  And as we talk about the money, they don't have any money to protect the border here
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:28.640]  in America. But there's absolutely no problem in the money that they spend throughout Afghanistan,
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:33.720]  Iraq. I mean, did you ever hear any discussion about that? Any complaints about any of that?
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:39.480]  Any objections? Did it ever come up for a vote? No, it just went into the general military
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:44.320]  budget. And out of the general military budget, we were able to do anything that we wanted
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:49.920]  to, to defend Iraq or Afghanistan or to invade and occupy Syria without any authorization,
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:53.960]  not even telling Congress about it. Leon Panetta said, yeah, we might tell you about it after
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:58.720]  we decided to do it in consultation with our foreign allies, NATO and the UN. We might
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:05.560]  tell you about it, Senator Sessions. Golly, I can't believe you'd say that. You know what
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:11.680]  the Constitution is. You were Congressman once, but he didn't call him on it. He didn't
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:21.360]  expose it when it happened. Nobody tried to impeach Obama or Sessions or Panetta for putting
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:25.840]  us into Syria without even talking about it, having a discussion about whether or not we
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:31.040]  should do that. Yeah, once the war starts, it's up to the President to run it. But whether
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:35.080]  or not we have a war under the Constitution, that's something that is supposed to be decided
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:40.840]  by the people's representatives in a public debate. What is the objective? What is the
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:46.960]  threat? What does it look like to win this war? No, they're not going to do that.
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:50.720]  And so what did it look like? Let's just go back and look at, as we're talking about this
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:58.560]  $5 billion that the Democrats will shut the government down for. And then after they don't
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:06.240]  even fund 200 miles of the wall, which is only about 10% of the distance, they won't
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:13.560]  even fund 10% of the wall. They want to abolish ICE as well. That tells you that this is about
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:19.840]  the border. It's not about the wall specifically. But just remember, it's $5 billion. The Special
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:29.120]  Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction, cigar, maybe, a cigar, found that they spent
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:34.880]  over $60 billion on Iraqi reconstruction after we go in and blow up their infrastructure,
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:41.280]  and then we rebuild it. But we can't rebuild our infrastructure here. They said it didn't
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:46.240]  significantly improve life for the Iraqis. Oh, what a surprise. The parallel body that
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:52.720]  was covering Afghanistan, the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction, concluded
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:59.200]  last year that at least $15.5 billion, now how much is that? That's three times what President
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:05.960]  Trump is asking for for the wall. $15.5 billion had been wasted in that country between 2008
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:12.520]  and 2017, and that this was likely only a fraction, they said, a fraction of the financial
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:14.520]  leakage.
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:18.400]  And then of course, we had all the politicians going insane when President Trump had the
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:25.240]  audacity to point out that NATO needs to be funded by somebody other than us. NATO, that
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:31.960]  thing that is the core of our strength, said Mattis. What a deception that is. You know,
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:36.840]  we look at this $5 billion, again, a third of what they wasted in Afghanistan, just in
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:46.360]  Afghanistan, not even counting Iraq. They spent $60 billion on Iraqi reconstruction.
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:50.320]  Five times what President Trump is asking for. President Trump has said $20 billion to
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:57.920]  build a whole wall. Whether that would be done or not, they wasted three times that amount
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:06.360]  just in Iraq. I'm sorry, 15 times that amount. 12 times that amount in Iraq and three times
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:10.800]  that in Afghanistan.
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:16.080]  So what are we talking about here? With $4 trillion, we're talking about not 1%, we're
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:24.000]  talking about 0.125%. One eighth of 1%. They can't find that money. It's one third of what
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:30.880]  we spent for Boston's bloated big dig project, where they took a highway and dug it. It's
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:37.920]  a one half of what we lost with the General Motors bailout. So we blow money on bailouts
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:44.800]  for General Motors. We blow money on wasteful projects in Boston, cost overrun, bad design
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:49.040]  and so forth. And quite frankly, I'm concerned about that with the wall. I think $23 million
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:54.680]  per mile is too much money. They over engineer, they overspend on everything that they do.
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:13:01.040]  We need to get the guys that built those dozen air bases and the dozen military bases and
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:05.880]  four airfields in Syria. We need to get them to do it because we need it done quickly.
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:11.880]  We don't need to take a decade or two to build a wall at the border. We don't need to spend
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:18.600]  $23 million a mile. Remember Alaska? Remember how they got the, after they had a massive
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:21.720]  earthquake there, they were able to rebuild the roads there in just a couple of weeks.
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:26.840]  They got them completely rebuilt after an earthquake. And yet here in Austin, just like
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:33.480]  in Boston, we can't seem to figure out how to build roads. Certainly can't do it on budget.
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:39.360]  But we take decades to get these projects done. This was happening here in Austin. And it's
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:43.760]  happening everywhere in the United States because of corruption. That's really what's
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:48.560]  going on. The same type of thing that was happening in Iraq and Afghanistan. It was
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:55.280]  a corruption that meant that we spent $60 billion and wasted that money in Iraq 12 times
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:14:02.280]  what he's asking for or three times in Afghanistan lost just leaking, they said.
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:07.320]  And so Mattis has now signed the order to withdraw US troops from Syria. Trump went
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:12.280]  on to say that Mattis didn't see a problem with US subsidizing the militaries of rich
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:17.120]  countries or allowing them to quote, take total advantage of the US and our taxpayers
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:23.320]  on trade. And that's true. That's exactly true. But you're going to see everybody united
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:29.800]  against President Trump as he tries to bring a little bit more peace on earth at this time
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:36.280]  of year. Isn't it amazing? It really does go back to what we saw 104 years ago. But
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:40.040]  there's other twists that we see coming out over this weekend. As I said at the beginning
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:47.320]  of the program at Christmas time where people are talking about how we have, you've probably
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:51.240]  heard the song sung many times, Hark the Herald Angels sing one of the lines in that mild
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:57.800]  he lays his glory by born that man no more may die. But what do they tell us? They say,
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:01.760]  oh, well, we're going to in 30 years we're going to live forever. We're going to have
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:06.080]  immortality will be the new plastic surgery. But of course it'll only be for the rich
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:11.400]  people. That's what we're being told by the Daily Star. Immortality is on the horizon
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:16.920]  according to leading transhumanists. This is the way they take the good news and they
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:21.320]  spend it in the bad news or into elitist news. They said the rich and famous will be getting
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:26.320]  the treatment by the 2050s. Similar to how stars are having plastic surgery today. Does
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:29.760]  that mean you're going to wind up with fish lips if you live forever? I don't know. Anyway,
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:33.040]  they said there's quite a lot of people that are interested in living forever. Oh, you
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:39.320]  think you think that has been the desire of mankind since the Garden of Eden. And they've
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:44.480]  been lying to us just like these transhumanists are lying to us today. You will live forever.
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:49.480]  You will become like God. No, we had God take care of that. We'll talk a little bit more
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:54.200]  about how they're spinning this and the message from the Imam that if you wish a Christian
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:16:19.200]  marriage Christmas, that's worse than murder.
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:35.480]  You may need this herbal tea for relief right away. So write this down. If you take meds

[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:39.800]  them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people

[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:07.360]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:11.760]  yeast. As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team

[01:18:54.760 --> 01:19:04.000]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember, this life is a test and those of
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.040]  you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:13.200]  and nationalism and Christianity coming back from the dead and recognizing it's being persecuted,
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:18.120]  that's all because you are the core, listening to InfoWars around the world, the eyes and
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:26.040]  ears of liberty that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming. Everybody
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:32.080]  knows who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians who tend to be immune to the
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:36.520]  globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it and that's why they're trying to eradicate
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:43.440]  you. But regardless, this fight is intensifying. 2018 has been insane. 2019 is going to be
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:49.640]  the big decision maker and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me. Not behind
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:52.920]  us but right beside us and at the heart of everything resisting these globalists. So
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:20:01.960]  whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute you.
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:08.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:26.680]  Welcome back on this day after Christmas 2018 and as I was looking at the headlines
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:35.360]  over the holidays, so much stuff. It's such a twisted version of the Christmas story
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:40.240]  of what Christ has done. You've got Alexandria occasional cortex out there saying, look,
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:45.960]  you've got the story of Christmases about refugee migrants. You have people talking
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:51.360]  about living forever in 30 years. Science is going to get us there or mainstream media
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:58.560]  talking about how the blood of children is going to let them live forever. As Free Thought
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:02.360]  Project put it out, the mainstream media is now openly reporting on this. What was once
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:08.360]  a conspiracy? Now is the subject of mainstream media reports over and over again. The elite
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:15.680]  began lining up to ingest the blood of children. We talked about how this is a hidden thing
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:19.760]  for a long time, you know, kind of like chemtrails. But now we can come out and talk about it.
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:24.360]  Oh, it's a good thing and we're going to do it. Before it was now. You're crazy. Nobody
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:29.160]  would ever do that. Just like you're crazy if you think they're spying on you with your
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:36.320]  computer. If you think that they're able to turn on the camera and listen to you. If you
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:42.600]  think that they're following you, your paranoid, your conspiracy theorist, all these things
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:47.720]  are true folks. And as we look at this as a good, the secret to eternal youth be found
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:55.040]  in blood transfusions from young people. Yes, CBS. Yes, young blood from teenagers. And
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:22:01.160]  again, it was back in January of last year. So it was about a year ago that they went
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:06.640]  public with the experiments about mice. And he had Peter Thiel. It's how I'm saying I'm
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:10.600]  looking into this parabiosis stuff, which I think is really interesting. This is where
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:14.440]  they did the young blood and older mice and they found they had a massive rejuvenating
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:21.680]  effect. But now, here we are a year later. That was back in January last year. It was
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:28.440]  a science and nature medicine. They were the ones who put it out there. And now they're
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:33.880]  going beyond mice. Now you've got a startup company called Ambrosia. And they're doing
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:38.480]  it with humans and the rich are lining up to get the blood of young humans. They said
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:42.640]  the brains are younger, their hearts, their hair. If it was gray, it turns dark again.
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:49.360]  They said after the treatment. And so this is their promise of how they are going to
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:53.920]  give you eternal life. And so we found it was safe and feasible to administer infusions
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:23:02.080]  of young plasma weekly, said a doctor, Dr. Sharon Shaw, a doctor at the Alzheimer's Research
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:07.240]  Facility at Stanford. So they're out in the open about it. And they think they've got
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:09.960]  this solved. And so that's why you've got the transhumanists and others saying it's
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:14.920]  just a matter of money. If you've got enough money, it'd be like plastic surgery. And you
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:18.680]  will live forever. We've got immortality on the horizon. The transhumanists told us that.
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:23.280]  And if we can't do it by injecting you with blood from babies and young people and stuff
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:29.000]  like that, we can somehow transfer your mind into a machine. How about that? That's what
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.960]  Ray Kurzweil wants to do. That's what the transhumanists are doing. It has always been
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:38.600]  their promise that you'll become like God, that you will live forever. There you go.
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:43.360]  You're transferring it over. You know, I look at this, I think about the, and they say it's
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:48.800]  like plastic surgery. I think about the movie Brazil. Remember that? Remember the plastic
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:55.800]  surgery? That was so popular. That course of Brazil was kind of a Monty Python version
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:02.800]  of 1984. Terry Gilliam did that movie. And all the technology didn't quite work. You
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:06.320]  know, they had TV screens, but they couldn't get big TV screens. So they had big Fresnel
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:10.120]  lenses that they put in front of it. And the plastic surgery that everybody was getting
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:14.400]  really wasn't working out too well. And they might find the same types of things happening
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:18.960]  with this. But of course, as they're pushing this in the Daily Star, the caption of one
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:25.640]  of these pictures, never grow old. Humans could change nature. I don't think so. And
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:30.040]  I don't think that human nature changes. I think that everybody has always believed
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:33.480]  a lie that they will become like God, that they will live forever, that they can do
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:38.720]  it themselves. Another example of how they're twisting it. But I think what we're really
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:45.360]  seeing over the holidays is a very interesting thing that's happening in some of the Islamic
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:53.480]  countries where they're starting to openly embrace secular aspects of Christmas. But
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:58.120]  not all of them. As you'll see here in the U.S., they're a little bit more open and honest
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:02.560]  about it because, of course, the Liberals have their backs. The Liberals hate everything
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:09.760]  about Christmas. Whether it's Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer or Jesus Christ, they hate it. And
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:12.840]  so the Muslims here in America are a little bit more bold than they are in the Middle
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:20.160]  East. In Lebanon, they're trying to pretend that they are now embracing Christianity.
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:26.600]  The Iranian cultural attaché stepped up to the microphone in Beirut, flanked by banners
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:32.160]  bearing the faces of Iran's two foremost religious authorities, Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:37.560]  of the Islamic Republic. That's the picture you'll remember from the kidnapping of everybody
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:43.240]  in the U.S. Embassy, to Ayatollah Khomeini, the current supreme leader. And I don't know
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:46.560]  if you pronounce these things differently or not. I mean, the only difference is one
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:52.960]  letter between these two guys. One of them, they changed the O to an A. Khomeini and Khomeini
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:56.720]  are the current ones. But nothing really has changed. They still chant Death to America
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:02.560]  every day there. To the left of Ayatollah Khomeini stood a twinkling Christmas tree, a gold
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:09.760]  star, gilding its tip, angel ornaments, and miniature Santa hats. See, Santa is safe.
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:14.240]  Even the Christians who are being attacked by Jihadi terrorists in Egypt at their churches,
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:19.960]  they have to have bomb scanners and security and so forth, like they do with the TSA. But
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:25.440]  of course, like the TSA is totally ineffective. They just blow themselves up at the checkpoint
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:32.320]  and take out all the people waiting in line to get a security check. But even in Egypt,
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:37.840]  you see pictures of these people in Christian churches, and they're having celebrations
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:41.920]  there and in places like India where they've had a lot of persecution of Christians, they'll
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:48.560]  come out with giant inflatable Santa clauses because that's somehow safe. And I don't know,
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:52.520]  I've never been part of a church where we worshiped Santa Claus. They said, today we're
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:56.880]  celebrating the birth of Christ. They said, Jesus, these are the Ayatollahs of Iran. Do
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:59.760]  you really believe them? When they're in Lebanon, they're saying this? They said, Jesus, the
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:04.120]  Savior is born. They're calling him their Savior. The King of Peace, the Son of Mary.
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:09.440]  He freed the slaves. He heals. The angels protect him. The Bible and the Quran embraced
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:14.320]  together. See, we're all the same religion, they said. Now there's a real key difference
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:21.480]  here. Yes, you know, Islam teaches that Jesus was born of a virgin, the Virgin Mary. The
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:27.200]  difference is they don't embrace him as Savior. They don't embrace him as God. That's the
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:32.920]  key difference. And without that, there really isn't any meaning to Christmas. And they don't
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:38.880]  really have anything to do with their sin. They don't have a Savior. What they have is
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:43.920]  a self-righteous religion. There's Christians who have a self-righteous religion as well.
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:49.480]  You know, maybe you're looking at it the same way as well. But you go back to the blood,
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:55.000]  you're going back to Leviticus. The life is in the blood. That has always been the understanding.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:02.160]  Science has now proven that. And it was his life given with his blood is why we call him
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:09.720]  a Savior. They will celebrate Jesus as virgin born and so forth, but they say that he was
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:13.760]  removed from the cross before he died, that he didn't die for their sins. So what do they
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:19.920]  do? They try to atone for their own lives. And so they have a lot of different things
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:26.200]  that they do. Some of them, it may include the good works, may be enslaving the infidel.
[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:30.360]  It may be killing the infidel. That may be the way that they get into heaven, right?
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:34.360]  For some of them, that's absolutely what they want to say. And here in America, going to
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:39.640]  play for you what this in North America should say, what this Canadian Imam said, if you
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:45.600]  wish a Christian, Merry Christmas, that is a worse sin than murdering somebody. Yeah,
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:50.560]  you'd be better off to murder that infidel. That's really the way that they think. All
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:29:20.400]  right, stay with us. Be right back. We'll play that clip for you when we get back.

[01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:02.360]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:08.640]  law. If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:14.320]  that the emperor has no clothes that can call BS, it's game over. But if you look at everybody
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:18.520]  else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:24.320]  are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted. There's only two groups
[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:30.840]  in the U.S. info wars and Matt Rudge of drudgereport.com that are truly independent. And of course
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:35.280]  there are two of the dominant media forces in the world. It really is amazing. That's
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:40.080]  why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all
[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:44.000]  in and how far we've come together. Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength,
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:51.080]  you're the will of info wars. So please spread the links info wars.com, news wars.com, prison
[01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:55.440]  punna.com, because if you don't spread the articles, the videos, no one else will. We're
[01:32:55.440 --> 01:33:02.880]  all in each other's hands. God bless you all and thank you. You're listening to the Alex
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:27.080]  Jones show.
[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:31.160]  Welcome back. We're going to take a look at this Canadian imam who had the boldness to
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:37.040]  say what he really believed here and what the left agrees with him on saying Merry Christmas
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:41.520]  is worse than murder. It's one of the worst things you can do according to the left, according
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:49.080]  to Islam, but they're pretending in Lebanon and other places to embrace Christianity.
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:52.320]  They will do that. And we'll talk a little bit about what's going on with that. We're
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:58.800]  going to get into red and green environmentalism. That's the new environmentalist new deal that's
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:05.480]  coming up also has something I want to say about LeBron James and his slave mentality.
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:11.200]  I'll tell you who the real slaves are. It certainly isn't the multimillion dollar players.
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:16.440]  I think it's you and I who are being ripped off by the multimillion dollar players and
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:21.400]  the billionaire owners and the people like Jeff Bezos who gets the massive subsidies
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:25.880]  in places like New York. But that's just one of the worst examples. This stuff has been
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:31.320]  going on for a long time with the sports community. We're also talking about universal basic income.
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:38.320]  We've got a lot of people, newcomers into politics on the left and they are a radical
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:46.760]  group folks. The mayor of Stockton, a young mayor there in a city that's just about to
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:50.760]  come out of bankruptcy and now they're going to implement universal basic income there.
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:58.480]  We have Alexandria occasional cortex who's pushing this new green deal. These people
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:04.600]  are pushing socialism really hard and the mainstream of the party is falling in line
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:08.320]  with them. We're going to have a big fight coming up this next year. Before we get into
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:12.920]  all that, I just want to remind you of the sale that we have the end of year clearance

[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:19.600]  sale that we have at infowarstore.com. That's what I was saying before we went to break.
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:26.520]  We have the Ayatollahs, the Iranians, the Hezbollah, that is now moved in a big way
[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:33.520]  into Lebanon. There's been a lot of Syrians that have fled into Lebanon. As they point
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:40.520]  out, Lebanon is only about 4 million people. But they're housing 2 million Syrian refugees.
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:46.040]  It's really putting a strain on them economically, culturally. Lebanon has been one of these
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:51.960]  countries that has had a pluralistic society. They tolerated Christianity there, but that's
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:57.080]  not necessarily the case anymore. They're concerned about that happening. And as we
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:05.360]  see, that's why they have the Hezbollah and the Iranian Ayatollahs there in Beirut, Lebanon
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:10.400]  with Santa Claus. And then on either side of Santa Claus, they have the Ayatollah Khomeini
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:17.840]  and the Ayatollah Khomeini, the current guy. And the one that started through the Shah
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:22.520]  of Iran out, took over the U.S. Embassy, the original Ayatollah. It's kind of like what
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:28.640]  you see in China, where if you want to put up a crucifix in a church building, you're
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:32.960]  now required by law to worship Mao and the current president. That's kind of what they've
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:37.240]  got going in Beirut. So it kind of gives you an idea. They're not really exactly tolerating
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:48.640]  Christianity. And as part of that, as part of the idea that if you can lie to the infidel
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:54.400]  and you can take over their country or you can get yourself in power, it's okay to lie
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:38:00.520]  under those circumstances. In Denmark, in the last week or so, they passed a law that
[01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:04.760]  has really gotten the left very upset about this. They said that you're going to have
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:12.280]  to conclude your citizenship naturalization ceremony with a handshake. And the Muslims
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:17.660]  are saying, you can't do that. That's racist. Critics of the bill argue that it's aimed
[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:25.160]  at discouraging Muslims from seeking Danish citizenship. No, the purpose of it is to say,
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:31.280]  are you going to see yourself as a Dane or as a Muslim? Because the problem is that they
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:36.400]  are not assimilating into the society. They're remaining in their own ghetto. And what we
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:41.040]  see is with the second generation, this one, it gets really dangerous. These are people
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:46.080]  who have grown up ghettoized, self ghettoized because they did not want to be a part of
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:50.200]  that society. And they don't succeed economically. The young people that are growing up there
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:53.200]  say, look at this, we're being discriminated against, even though it's their parents who
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:59.400]  have done it to them. And they are the ones who become the most radical shihadis. But
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:03.880]  what's going on in Denmark? The Danish lawmakers have approved a government-backed proposal
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:08.000]  to make citizenship applicants shake hands with the official conducting the naturalization
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:14.440]  ceremony. And it's been criticized for discriminating against Muslims because they don't want to
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:20.240]  shake the filthy hands of those non-Muslims. It requires those applying for Danish citizenship
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:24.500]  to commit to the country's values and to show respect for its government by shaking hands
[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:30.040]  with its representative. They said that it's aimed at Muslims who refuse on religious grounds
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:35.760]  to touch members of the opposite sex, even in a handshake. Said Denmark is not alone.
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:40.200]  Authorities in Switzerland and France have recently cited the lack of assimilation and
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:45.200]  rejection of citizenship to foreigners who refuse to shake hands with officials. If you
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:48.880]  arrive in Denmark where it's custom to shake hands when you greet, if you don't do it,
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:53.440]  it's disrespectful. Said one lawmaker who pushed it. And of course, that is just one
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:58.480]  part of the bigger issue. They want to pretend that they want to be part of the society,
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:02.600]  but then they don't even, can't even bring themselves to the point of a handshake. But
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:07.160]  here in North America we don't have that problem, them trying to hide it. We have a Canadian
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:14.880]  imam that made it very clear that wishing Merry Christmas to people, a Muslim wishing
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:21.040]  Merry Christmas is worse than a Muslim committing murder. Here's a clip of that imam who is
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:26.880]  speaking to the Muslim youth of Victoria, British Columbia, his imam, Kathrata. Here
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:47.320]  he is. If a person were to commit every major sin committing adultery, dealing with interest,
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:51.280]  all of these sins, if a person were to do all of those major sins, they are nothing compared
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:58.560]  to the sin of congratulating and greeting the non-Muslims on their false festivals.
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:01.920]  There you go. Congratulations on the birth of your Lord. He said, is that acceptable
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:05.280]  to a Muslim? Are you now approving of their beliefs by saying that you are approving of
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:12.360]  it when you say Merry Christmas to them? What are you congratulating them on? And again,
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:17.480]  in Lebanon, they're trying to say, oh, yes, we worship the Quran and the Bible are the
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:23.200]  same, right? Just like when you'll see when they shout Allahu Akbar, they say, they're
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:28.200]  simply saying, God is great. Yeah, they worship, they're a monotheistic religion. We're a
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:33.160]  monotheistic religion. They have many of the same people in their book and so forth. No,
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:39.080]  it's not the same. And he is saying that quite clearly. As a matter of fact, look at Pakistan,
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:42.760]  our wonderful ally over there. I'm sure that James Mattis thinks that they're great allies
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:48.040]  of ours. They've now just sent us two more Christians to death for blasphemy. And we
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:55.960]  had the one woman who spent eight years on death row. She had the audacity to drink water.
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:42:01.320]  She was laboring in the field and the Muslim women there said, you filthy Christian, if
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:03.960]  you don't convert, you're not going to drink water there. She said, I'm a Christian. I'm
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:07.560]  not going to convert just to drink water. So they had her arrested on blasphemy. They had
[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:12.560]  her on death row for eight years. One of the legislators there in Pakistan said, this is
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:17.680]  an insane law. We need to change it. So his bodyguard murdered him. And then when the
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:22.720]  Supreme Court overthrew the conviction of Asia BB, the woman who was on death row for
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:26.720]  eight years in Pakistan, when they overturned that said, you're not going to execute her
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:34.280]  for having a drink of water as a Christian and calling that blasphemy. You had riots
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:39.080]  all over Pakistan. Wasn't reported by the American media, but it was riots like you're
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:43.200]  seeing in France with the yellow vests all over Pakistan. Why? Because they wanted to
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:48.440]  kill that Christian woman for blasphemy. Now they've sent us two more Christians to death
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:50.200]  for blasphemy. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:01.360]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:07.680]  law. If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:13.360]  that the emperor has no clothes that can call BS, it's game over. But if you look at everybody
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:17.560]  else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:23.360]  are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted. There's only two groups
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:30.080]  in the U.S. Infowars and Matt Rudge of Rudgerport.com that are truly independent. And of course,
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:34.320]  they're two of the dominant media forces in the world. It really is amazing. That's
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:38.880]  why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:42.520]  we're all in and how far we've come together. Just remind you that you are the power, you're
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:48.600]  the strength, you're the will of Infowars. So please spread the links. Infowars.com,
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:52.760]  NewsWars.com, PrismPlanet.com. Because if you don't spread the articles in the videos,
[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:57.160]  no one else will. We're all in each other's hands. God bless you all and thank you.
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:01.200]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:06.480]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ. It
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:11.680]  literally dumbs the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers,
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:17.040]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First, seaweed-based
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:21.200]  iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us getting
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:26.200]  a supply of it. So we discovered deep earth crystals, a pure nascent iodine and brought
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:31.160]  you X2. That's been incredible. Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we
[01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:37.040]  did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists,
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:41.800]  scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds,
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:49.840]  two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable. Ladies
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:54.000]  and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:45:02.240]  Here's three now available at M4's Live.com. So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember,
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:06.240]  this life is a test. And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:11.080]  action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity coming back from the dead
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:16.360]  and recognizing it's being persecuted, that's all because you are the core, listening to
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:23.680]  M4 Wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty that were immune or at least resistant
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:29.040]  to the globalist programming. Everybody knows who studies this, that it's Christians, real
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:35.080]  Christians who tend to be immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it. And that's
[01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:41.720]  why they're trying to eradicate you. But regardless, this fight is intensifying. 2018 has been
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:47.720]  insane. 2019 is going to be the big decision maker. And I am so honored to be here with
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:52.440]  you right beside me, not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything,
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:56.220]  in these globalists. So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history
[01:45:56.220 --> 01:46:01.280]  together and I salute you. We all know the importance of fish oils. While we are sure

[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:28.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Welcome back. I've got a couple of more things
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:33.680]  to look at here with Christmas snooze. I'll put a bookmark on this. We're going to take
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:41.680]  a look at LeBron James, his slavery mentality comment. And then we'll talk about what slavery
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:45.880]  really looks like here in the U.S. We'll talk about the TSA and the travel hell that you're
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:50.240]  probably experiencing if you are traveling. Before we do real quickly, I just want to
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:55.120]  remind you again of our end of the year total store clearance at InfowarsStore.com. We have
[01:47:55.120 --> 01:48:01.160]  many items that are 50, 60, even up to 75% off. We have free shipping. We have double

[01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:12.600]  sale that we have at InfowarsStore.com. A great time to take a look and provide for
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:17.040]  your health coming up in this new year. We've got some health news coming up as well later
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:19.000]  in the program.
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:26.760]  As we look at this story about Merry Christmas, about the Muslims in Lebanon telling everybody
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:31.840]  we all worship the same God, the same Jesus, and so forth, except that Christianity is
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:36.000]  being exterminated in Lebanon. That's the reality of it. Here they're not really trying
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:44.880]  to miss any words. I just played for you the clip from the Canadian Imam saying that wishing
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:51.200]  a Christian Merry Christmas is celebrating their Savior and it is worse than committing
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:49:00.160]  murder. He has a whole list of sins, adultery, embezzling money, raping somebody. Here's
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:04.440]  his list right here. Every major sin. He says if a person were to commit every major sin,
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:10.080]  committing adultery, dealing with interest, lying, murder, because if a person were to
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:13.960]  do all those major sins, they are nothing compared to the sin of congratulating and greeting
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:21.480]  the non-Muslim on their false festivals. So while they may pretend to be embracing Christianity
[01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:26.760]  and Christmas abroad, this is really the way they feel and this is really the way that
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:31.040]  the Liberals feel. He's safe saying that here in America. Safer to say that here than he
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:37.880]  is in Lebanon, perhaps, because here we have senior citizens being banned from saying Merry
[01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:44.200]  Christmas. This is what's happening here in America. A residence for seniors in Washington
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:49.840]  State, reports W&D, has decided to ban the words Merry Christmas. They claim the Department
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:55.080]  of Housing and Urban Development requires those actions and so now you have people from
[01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:58.600]  the Alliance Defending Freedom who are taking them to court saying, no it doesn't. We have
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:04.880]  a First Amendment. They said the building manager told a Christian resident that the
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:09.720]  Federal Fair Housing Act prohibits residents from saying Merry Christmas, singing Christmas
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:13.760]  carols that reference Christ or displaying any decorations or cards referencing the
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:18.720]  Christian religion during the Christmas season. It kind of sounds like that Canadian imam
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:23.440]  doesn't it? But it's the federal government and they made a law, right? So in truth, no
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:28.080]  federal law prohibits such Christmas expressions, said the Alliance Defending Freedom. Americans
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:31.600]  don't lose their constitutionally protected freedom to say Merry Christmas or to otherwise
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:36.760]  express their faith just because they live in a facility that accepts government funds.
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:41.560]  See, it's the same kind of logic. You know, people would think, well, you know, I can
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:49.240]  do this because we've seen the ACLU invoke these types of freedom from religion clauses
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:53.520]  in schools, for example. They're using the same thing. Oh, there's government money involved
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:57.960]  here. So you can't, we're going to put a gag order on you. No, it doesn't. That should
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:03.680]  be pushed back. Just as we've got some pastors who are pushing back on the gag orders who
[01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:08.920]  are put on pastors to say anything political from the pulpit. There's no such restriction
[01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:13.040]  there either. They would have to get rid of the First Amendment in order to do something
[01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:18.760]  like that. As he points out, the same person who was saying, well, there's a housing and
[01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:23.280]  urban development rule that requires that that same person permitted a menorah in the
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:28.680]  public space, quote, because it was a cultural expression, unquote.
[01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:32.200]  It just happens to be the cultural expression that that person wanted to allow. But here's
[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:40.920]  another example of it, also from W&D. A family photo was deemed too religious for U.S. customs
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:46.400]  Christmas stamp. They have a program. I didn't know about this. The U.S. Postal Service has
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:53.320]  a program where you can have companies create custom Christmas stamps. And as part of this,
[01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:59.320]  a family had a picture of themselves taken in Moscow. And it's not because of Russia,
[01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:04.000]  Russia, Russia. No, it's because of Christ, Christ, Christ that they had a problem at
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:08.200]  the U.S. Post Office. So what they have there in the background, if you look at that picture,
[01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:12.760]  you can barely tell what's in the background. I mean, it's mostly the family, they're standing
[01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:19.440]  in front of St. Basil's Cathedral. It's a Moscow icon. It is an historic location.
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:22.920]  But I wouldn't have known that to look at that. I wouldn't have recognized it that much.
[01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:26.520]  But somebody was scrutinizing these types of things. You've got some little religious
[01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:32.120]  policemen there at the post office that says, oh, I know what that is. That's a cathedral
[01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:39.160]  in the background. Can't have that on a U.S. postal stamp. And said, no, you can't do that.
[01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:44.880]  We're going to throw that out. So now they're having to fight for that. So we look at those
[01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:49.760]  types of things happening here in America. There we go. There's the cathedral there in
[01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:54.040]  the background. Maybe that's the postal stamp that they had that was cropped before. So
[01:52:54.040 --> 01:52:57.400]  you can see the cathedral a little bit better. Well, what's the point? I mean, you're not
[01:52:57.400 --> 01:53:00.840]  allowed to show a picture of that. You should be able to put any kind of picture you want.
[01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:07.560]  It's called free expression, the free exercise of religion. It's what's in the First Amendment.
[01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:11.260]  It's not freedom from religion. You know, there's actually an organization that goes
[01:53:11.260 --> 01:53:18.480]  around suing people, saying, calling themselves actually the freedom from religion foundation.
[01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:24.960]  Freedom from religion is not in the Constitution. The free exercise of religion without any restraints
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:29.960]  is in the Constitution. But of course, they're coming after the First Amendment, every aspect
[01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:35.040]  of that very clearly. When we look at what's happening in other persecution, of course,
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:41.040]  this time of year, even in India, you have a Christian pastor arrested for showing a
[01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:46.440]  film about Jesus called Jesus Christ. He was arrested in India. They said, minorities are
[01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:51.960]  even more vulnerable and intimidated by the majority and by its false accusations said
[01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:58.920]  a person, part of a group of Christians there in India. So it's not just in Islamic countries.
[01:53:58.920 --> 01:54:03.880]  And it's not just on religious grounds either. Because in China, as we pointed out many times,
[01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:11.240]  we have a pastor there who is looking at a 15-year jail sentence, Pastor Wang Yi. A hundred
[01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:16.440]  members of his church were arrested because he published a manifesto. Very brave. One
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:24.000]  pastor in China called him the bravest pastor in China because he tackled head on the demands
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:29.880]  by President Xi, who wants to see himself worshiped as a God. I mean, this is a guy who's
[01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:34.200]  now running China. This is the guy that the mainstream media and Wall Street side with
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:39.560]  him on every conflict with President Trump. Well, there's trying to equalize tariffs.
[01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:43.800]  You know, President Trump says, your tariffs are 10 times what ours are. Take yours down
[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:46.600]  or I'll raise mine to your level. And then they all freak out. Look at this. President
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:54.600]  Trump has raised his tariffs to 25%. It's like they never criticize China for anything
[01:54:54.600 --> 01:55:01.920]  that they do, not for piracy, not for unequal trade tariffs. They always take the side of
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:07.640]  this guy who is a megalomaniac demanding that he be worshiped. It's not just putting his
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:12.600]  picture up in next to the cross and the churches, but he also demands that you have to read
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:17.440]  from his writings at the wedding ceremonies and so forth. And so this pastor, his name
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:23.920]  is Pastor Wang Yi. You should pray for this man. He's now been arrested because he wrote
[01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:30.080]  a manifesto. He said he's calling for Caesar worship. He says, I have no desire to dictate
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:35.760]  what policy is going to be, but I will not worship this politician. We're not called
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:42.360]  to do that. And so they very quickly the next day after he published that, they rounded
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:48.280]  up 100 people have been arrested out of that one church. They went to their homes, to their
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:52.960]  places of business. They cut off their power so they couldn't tell anybody what was happening.
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:57.880]  They just disappeared them. Some of them have been released. They were told that if they
[01:55:57.880 --> 01:56:03.880]  signed a statement saying this church was a cult and that they would never go back,
[01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:10.200]  that they would be released. Now the real cult is the cult of President Xi Jinping.
[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:14.960]  And we better understand just how dangerous that guy is. The people who demand that you
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:19.080]  worship them, the people who worship government, just as I said about Michael Moore, it's
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:25.200]  very sad to see Michael Moore worshiping Ruth Vader Ginsburg. Darth Vader Ginsburg,
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:32.400]  I call her. It's very sad to see him putting her on his Christmas tree. He even had some
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:37.800]  people on the left say this is a very dangerous area that we've gotten into worshiping the
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:50.160]  Supreme Court worshiping RGB. Yeah, she's not red, green, and blue, but she is being
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:54.840]  worshipped by the left and they basically give them godlike powers. There she is, Darth
[01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:58.880]  Vader Ginsburg. Somebody's already done the meme. I'm not the only one to think of that.
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:03.320]  And if we look at where this is happening everywhere, it's the gradually creeping of
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:10.680]  Sharia law, Germany. The Supreme Court has rejected the anti-child marriage law there.
[01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:16.120]  This is a situation again from a Syrian man. He moved into Germany. He wants to be reunited
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:24.200]  with his wife, who was his cousin, who was 14 years old. They just had an Austrian woman
[01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:32.480]  whose conviction was upheld by the European Court. She said, look at this, you have pedophilia
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:37.600]  embraced by Islam because Muhammad married a young girl that was eight or nine years
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:41.120]  old or whatever and said, you can't say that. We're going to find you. And now you've got
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:47.280]  in Germany to say, yeah, it's okay. This guy can marry his cousin who is 14 years old.
[01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:51.200]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:57.640]  the law. If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact
[01:57:57.640 --> 01:58:03.320]  that the emperor has no clothes that can call BS, it's game over. But if you look at everybody
[01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:07.520]  else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they
[01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:13.320]  are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted. There's only two groups
[01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:20.040]  in the U.S. Infowars and Matt Rudge of rudgereport.com that are truly independent. And of course,
[01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:24.280]  they're two of the dominant media forces in the world. It really is amazing. That's
[01:58:24.280 --> 01:58:29.120]  why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:33.040]  in and how far we've come together. Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength,
[01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:41.160]  you're the will of Infowars. So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswars.com, christenpana.com.

[01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:48.440]  in each other's hands. God bless you all and thank you.
[01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:53.680]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:57.920]  That's the globalist only hope. So when you support Infowars, when you spread our articles

[01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:12.400]  but you are standing for your own future and your own best shot of having an early warning
[01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:17.040]  system in America to stand against these individuals. When you order products at infowars.com,

[01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:30.560]  of a total store clearance. Every order gets a free t-shirt. Every order gets free shipping.
[01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:36.080]  Every order gets 50 to 75% off in total clearance. And that funding allows us to go into the
[01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:40.960]  new year on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year to not
[01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:45.560]  just fight, but to expand. We're on the march. The empire is on the run. I salute you all.
[01:59:45.560 --> 01:59:53.720]  Please take action at infowarsstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:16.520 --> 02:00:25.000]  Welcome back. We had LeBron James, of course, who got a lot of coverage over the weekend,
[02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:31.560]  saying the old white NFL owners have a slave mentality. And people were very quick to point
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:39.240]  out that he's not a slave. He's being paid handsomely. Millions of dollars. I don't think
[02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:47.800]  we've ever seen any slaves so richly rewarded. Again, it was hate and it was very hypocritical,
[02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:55.080]  I think. This guy who is pushing Islam, LeBron James out there. Let's understand folks when
[02:00:55.080 --> 02:01:02.360]  we talk about all this stuff that the place that you'll still find slavery is within Islam.
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:12.600]  After Hillary Clinton's successful Libya policy, they not only turned the place into an arms
[02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:20.600]  bizarre for ISIS, but now you literally have slave auction blocks back in Libya operating there.
[02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:26.760]  Why? Because Islam doesn't have a problem with slavery. You know, there have been Christians
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:29.720]  who have defended slavery. There have been Christians who have opposed it. But the reason
[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:33.560]  we don't have Christianity in Western civilization is because of a couple of Christians. William
[02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:41.800]  Wobberforce and William Pitt the Younger. There are two William Pitts who are prime minister.
[02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:46.920]  William Pitt the Younger. And they pushed back. Now they stopped the slave trade,
[02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:52.200]  then they stopped slavery. They did it without a war. They compensated the people for their
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:57.480]  property, did it peacefully. They spent less money compensating the slave owners in British
[02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:01.880]  territories and Bermuda and so forth. Then we spent on ammunition in the Civil War.
[02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:07.560]  And they did it on Christian values, Christian principles. So let's talk a little bit about
[02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:11.160]  slavery because that's where he wants to pull this in. He wants to pull in white. He wants to
[02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:15.720]  pull in slavery. Say, oh, all you white people, you're racist. And the only place that slavery
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:21.240]  has ever existed has been in America. No, that's not true. That's not true. It's been a part of
[02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:27.960]  every single civilization and culture. And it is still going on as part of Islam because
[02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:33.480]  it's okay to enslave other people if they are infidels. That's what they teach at this point
[02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:39.080]  in time. But let's understand who the real slaves are in all this. The real slaves are you and I.
[02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:47.400]  We're the ones, the idiots who don't realize that we're slaves. We're the ones who pay for
[02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:52.120]  these stadiums that these millionaires play in for their billionaire bosses that he calls
[02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:58.120]  plantation owners. We're the ones who really the slaves because we pay for that nonsense.
[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:05.080]  We just had in the last couple of weeks, the $35 million disappear out of a New Jersey
[02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:10.920]  failed baseball stadium. And now they're going to have to pay millions more to repurpose it,
[02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:14.600]  to tear it down and to repurpose it. But we've seen this happen over and over again.
[02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:22.120]  Five years ago, I was doing reports about how the NFL was taking advantage of people.
[02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:29.560]  At the time, the prices there were absurdly low. They have exploded in the amount of money that
[02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:35.080]  they get for these NFL stadiums. And this is way before any of this kneeling nonsense before
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:40.840]  they became the knee FL. We were being ripped off by these people, enslaved by these people.
[02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:46.680]  And now we're up to the point where they get half a billion dollars for these things. They're
[02:03:46.680 --> 02:03:53.960]  remodeling these stadiums more frequently than they are fixing the nuclear power plants we have.
[02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:59.240]  They create nuclear power plants. They have a useful life of 20, 25 years. And then they're
[02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:05.400]  supposed to be decommissioned or at the very least, they're supposed to have a massive reworking
[02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:10.680]  after 20 to 25 years. After a few decades, they get so radioactive, they have to shut them down.
[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:16.520]  But after a couple of decades, they start to get very dangerous because of the stress that's
[02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:20.680]  put on key cooling systems and so forth. But we don't worry about our nuclear power plants.
[02:04:20.680 --> 02:04:26.760]  We've got to rebuild those stadiums because we've got sports teams. And we all identify with that.
[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:31.320]  We wear their logos and we buy their overpriced sports merchandise.
[02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:36.760]  And it's taxes that are paid by local people, by local businesses.
[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:42.600]  That's why they call them bond issues because they put you in bondage to pay for that.
[02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:47.240]  That's the real slavery. And we're too stupid to understand it. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:58.200]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[02:04:58.200 --> 02:05:05.080]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no close,
[02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:11.400]  they can call BS if came over. But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh
[02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:17.080]  and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:05:17.080 --> 02:05:25.080]  There's only two groups in the U.S. Info Wars and Matt Rudge of Rudge Report.com that are truly independent.
[02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:29.720]  And, of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world. It really is amazing.
[02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:35.240]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in
[02:05:35.240 --> 02:05:42.280]  and how far we've come together. Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Info Wars.
[02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:46.840]  So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswars.com, christenpana.com.
[02:05:46.840 --> 02:05:51.560]  Because if you don't spread the articles in the videos, no one else will. We're all in each other's hands.
[02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:56.440]  God bless you all and thank you.
[02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:28.440]  Yeah, in the NFL, they've got a bunch of old white men owning teams and they have that slave mentality.
[02:06:28.440 --> 02:06:31.240]  And as I said at the top of the hour, no, we're the ones with the slave mentality.
[02:06:31.240 --> 02:06:39.400]  We're the ones who give these billionaires billions of dollars for their stadiums.
[02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:46.680]  When I first reported on this five, six years ago, you had the state of Minnesota going,
[02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:53.720]  as they were struggling with debt, they decided they'd spend half a billion dollars on a new stadium
[02:06:53.720 --> 02:06:58.040]  there. But that's nothing. Now they've got four billion dollar stadiums that they're putting in and
[02:06:58.760 --> 02:07:04.200]  California and these billionaire owners are demanding it. They're demanding that you sell
[02:07:04.200 --> 02:07:11.240]  yourself into bondage. You are indentured slaves to these people. Your property taxes,
[02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:15.320]  your the other businesses that operate in that area, they all become indentured slaves to these
[02:07:15.320 --> 02:07:20.200]  billionaires. That's the real slave mentality that we would embrace that because, oh, look, it's our
[02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:27.000]  team. We won the playoffs. No, you didn't. These millionaires and their subsidized billionaire
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:32.120]  owner are the ones who won or lost in these particular games. But here's the most recent one,
[02:07:32.920 --> 02:07:36.360]  New Jersey. And even before that, we had Seattle, they were talking about
[02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:40.840]  some bond issues that they were trying to get past there, how the people there had been
[02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:47.640]  left holding the bag. Because sometimes these teams don't wind up playing there or they play
[02:07:47.640 --> 02:07:50.280]  there for a few years and they say, well, you're going to build us a new stadium or we're going
[02:07:50.280 --> 02:07:56.120]  to take the team to another town that will. And we build these stadiums more frequently than we
[02:07:56.120 --> 02:08:03.080]  fix our nuclear reactors, our nuclear power plants. Camden, New Jersey, their improvement
[02:08:03.080 --> 02:08:08.280]  authority approved a one million dollar contract this month to demolish the 17 year old stadium
[02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:13.400]  after $21 million in taxpayer dollars built the structure for an independent minor league
[02:08:13.400 --> 02:08:18.440]  baseball teams. That's just minor league stuff. $21 million. That's minor league stuff, folks.
[02:08:18.440 --> 02:08:25.320]  We're talking $4 billion for an NFL stadium out in LA. That's, you know, as Everett Dixon said,
[02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:27.880]  a million here, a million there. Pretty soon you're talking about
[02:08:28.760 --> 02:08:32.520]  something that's an NFL stadium. You're talking about real money. Now, now we're in the billions
[02:08:32.520 --> 02:08:39.640]  of dollars now. That's how rapidly this thing is expanding. And that is nothing compared to the
[02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:44.360]  fact that in New Jersey, they were begging Jeff Bezos, richest man in the world, of course,
[02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:50.600]  to be subsidized there. We'll give you billions of dollars to move to this location. Of course,
[02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:58.200]  Bezos left the most amount of money on the table. You know, he's going to be subsidized
[02:08:58.200 --> 02:09:04.360]  quite a bit more in some of these jurisdictions. And he just walked away from that because he
[02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:08.360]  wanted to go where the economic and political centers were. And that should tell you everything
[02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:14.760]  about what this really was about. So in New York, the trillion dollar Amazon executives
[02:09:14.760 --> 02:09:18.520]  are blasted by New York City officials. So this is bad for all of us. Some of them are
[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:25.640]  complaining about it. They said $2.8 billion in tax breaks and grants to build a new headquarters
[02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:31.960]  in Queens. Why have we seen occasional cortex taking the lead on this? That's her neighborhood
[02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:37.960]  right there. But of course, along with her, we've got a lot of other young socialists. We're going
[02:09:37.960 --> 02:09:45.000]  to talk a little bit about her green New Deal for people who haven't seen any of this stuff before.
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:49.480]  You got to be that kind of green in order to fall for that kind of lie. Here's a guy who's
[02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:56.840]  pretty green, Michael Tubbs, a young socialist for more than a year now. He's been pushing the idea
[02:09:56.840 --> 02:10:03.000]  of universal basic income. If you don't know what universal basic income is, it is welfare on steroids.
[02:10:04.040 --> 02:10:09.400]  It is a way to make everybody dependent on the government. And the sad thing about this is that
[02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:16.040]  we've had people who are conservatives or libertarians now join in on this as well.
[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:23.000]  People like Charles Murray who wrote Losing Ground back in the 1980s, he talked about how welfare was
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:28.760]  not working for the people that were supposed to benefit. It was actually making them more dependent,
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:34.360]  and we needed to stop it. And that became the basis for massive welfare reform under Reagan.
[02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:38.840]  Or at least we hoped it was going to be massive welfare reform. They didn't reform anything,
[02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:42.760]  really. But that was the argument. We had a big fight over that. Nothing ever really happened. We
[02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:49.000]  got an even bigger welfare state now. But universal basic income is something that is coming up because
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:54.920]  they're looking at the massive unemployment that is staring us at fate in the face that's only about
[02:10:54.920 --> 02:11:03.400]  a decade away. By 2030, they expect to have all of us locked up into their cities, locked down,
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:08.440]  unable to move because they've taken away our private cars and so forth. That's part of this green
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:17.400]  initiative, this green New Deal. And they are looking at massive unemployment across all different
[02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:22.840]  industries and professions from the top to the bottom. So it's horizontal and vertical.
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:27.880]  It's going to affect people in white-collar jobs as well as blue-collar jobs. It's going to affect
[02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:33.320]  every type of business and industry all at once. It isn't going to be a situation like we've had in
[02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:39.640]  the past where there's been disruption and relocation in, let's say, agriculture or in a
[02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:44.760]  particular type of manufacturing. This is going to happen everywhere, to everybody. And as they
[02:11:44.760 --> 02:11:50.840]  look at this, you've seen the Bilderberg group talking about the precariat pulling in their Marxist
[02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:57.320]  ideology or the proletariat, but talking about how they, the elites, are now in a precarious position
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:01.000]  because they're very concerned they're going to touch off something like we see in France with the
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:06.600]  yellow jackets. People realizing, waking up to what they're doing too quickly. And so they have to
[02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:10.840]  pacify people. The way they want to pacify the yellow jackets and other people is with universal
[02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:17.960]  basic income. We'll just put everybody on welfare. We'll guarantee you a basic income. That is a
[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:26.840]  prescription for control. It's pacification and it's control and it is the deepest system of
[02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:31.080]  welfare we've ever seen proposed. And it's being embraced now by some of these same people like
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:36.120]  Charles Murray, who talked about how welfare was destroying the lives of people, the poor,
[02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:40.680]  the black and the inner cities and so forth, who are on welfare, how it had destroyed their lives.
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:47.560]  And now he is embracing it for all of us. It's kind of like what they did to the Native Americans
[02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:52.840]  with the Indian reservations. We've seen how that worked out for them and now they're applying the
[02:12:52.840 --> 02:13:00.200]  same types of stuff to us universally. Everybody. One of the things that they did was to make it
[02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:03.880]  impossible for them to work. They took their children away from them and the Indian reservations
[02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:09.320]  shipped them off to schools to be reeducated into a different culture, a different way of thinking.
[02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:13.320]  What do you think is happening with our federal control of education? Don't think they're doing
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:20.920]  that to our kids. You look at that picture of Alexandria occasional cortex, that glassy eyed
[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:25.560]  stare. I mean, she's not the only one that you've ever had a conversation with. If you talk to a
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:31.320]  millennial, there's a lot of people out there just like her that you can't carry on a conversation
[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:36.680]  with because they're non playable characters. They've been too brainwashed and uneducated,
[02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:45.320]  miseducated by the government schools and school systems. And that system of education
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:50.360]  comes the common core, dumbing everybody down, the deliberate dumbing down of America
[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:58.360]  as Charlotte, Isabel and Phyllis Schlafly pointed out. It's very deliberate. It is a deliberate
[02:13:58.360 --> 02:14:04.600]  dumbing down of America. And you can't even carry on conversations with these people because they
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:12.680]  just repeat labels or they try to silence you. And so we go to Stockton again. Michael Tubbs is
[02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:19.480]  young mayor, young socialist. He's come up with a nonprofit organization. They call it the Stockton
[02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:27.160]  Economic Empowerment Demonstration. It's got a great acronym, SEED, as in gone to seed,
[02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:31.640]  which is what that city is going to look like. It's going to look like Detroit. Detroit has
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:37.400]  gone to seed. You've got the buildings falling down. They're knocking down buildings and roads.
[02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:42.200]  And it literally is just going back to the grassland after what the Democrats have done to it.
[02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:47.400]  And this is what it's going to do as they go through with universal basic income.
[02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:52.120]  It was the first major city to file for bankruptcy. They did that back in 2012. They'll be doing that
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:59.320]  again pretty soon, believe me. They've already tried this in some other countries and they stopped it
[02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:05.960]  early, the universal basic income experiment. There's a guy who is running for president and
[02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:10.520]  2020 a Democrat. You've probably never heard of him. I heard of him because he was pushing universal
[02:15:10.520 --> 02:15:13.640]  basic income. That was going to be the thing he was going to run on. I tried to reach out to him
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:18.200]  and said, come on the program. He said, okay, Cheryl, come on. And then he found out who I was.
[02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:23.640]  I found out it was info warriors and he's not going to come on and debate universal income,
[02:15:23.640 --> 02:15:29.720]  universal basic income with me. His name is Yang. I tweeted out to him and said, come on,
[02:15:29.720 --> 02:15:33.960]  I'll be the Yang to your Yang and we'll talk about whether this is good for people. We've seen
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:39.000]  socialism applied before. We can still see it being applied in North Korea versus South Korea.
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:43.560]  That's the difference when you plan everything. Do you think your pension is going to be there
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:48.600]  for you? Illinois, their shortfall is worse than now to $134 billion. But don't worry,
[02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:52.920]  they got universal basic income from by same people that can't pay the pension to their
[02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:57.640]  government employees. We'll be right back. Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists,

[02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:04.520]  is the empire of the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United
[02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:10.920]  States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken. Its former colony,
[02:17:10.920 --> 02:17:17.480]  the U.S., had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began
[02:17:17.480 --> 02:17:23.880]  with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunne, available at Amazon Books.
[02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:28.840]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my
[02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:34.120]  mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:38.120]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[02:17:38.120 --> 02:17:42.920]  they thought might never be solved. I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't

[02:17:56.200 --> 02:18:00.920]  Please, whatever you do realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship and you
[02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:05.320]  saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with Info Wars. Yes, some of them are like little side
[02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:09.560]  accounts. They even know we had like Info Wars stores that just showed our products but they just
[02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:14.920]  banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks
[02:18:14.920 --> 02:18:18.920]  that loved us. Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought
[02:18:18.920 --> 02:18:23.720]  the country and the world back from the brink. But the globalists now want to target where the
[02:18:23.720 --> 02:18:30.120]  resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future. I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:35.400]  I want to keep going. I want to make them do the ultimate not just destroy us financially. I want
[02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:40.600]  to push all the way. I've committed to do that. I've prayed for that and I've been told that's
[02:18:40.600 --> 02:18:45.720]  going to happen but you've got to back it and I promise you this. I will never falter. I will
[02:18:45.720 --> 02:18:50.920]  never waver at the spiritual level. I physically will. But I give you my commitment if you financially
[02:18:50.920 --> 02:18:57.080]  support us at foreshore.com to give you my absolute total commitment. The globalists are
[02:18:57.080 --> 02:19:02.040]  trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law. If there's any
[02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:07.240]  opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no
[02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:13.160]  close that can call BS, it's game over. But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage
[02:19:13.160 --> 02:19:17.640]  and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks
[02:19:17.640 --> 02:19:24.600]  they're on that can be targeted. There's only two groups in the U.S. Infowars and Matt Drudge of
[02:19:24.600 --> 02:19:29.800]  Drudge Report.com that are truly independent. And of course there are two of the dominant media
[02:19:29.800 --> 02:19:36.040]  forces in the world. It really is amazing. That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind
[02:19:36.040 --> 02:19:40.120]  the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together. Just remind you
[02:19:40.120 --> 02:19:46.280]  that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Infowars. So please spread the links
[02:19:46.280 --> 02:19:50.760]  infowars.com, newswars.com, christenpana.com. Because if you don't spread the articles,
[02:19:50.760 --> 02:19:55.480]  the video goes, no one else will. We're all in each other's hands. God bless you all and thank you.
[02:19:55.480 --> 02:20:05.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:25.800 --> 02:20:29.880]  Yeah, don't worry, the government's got it taken care of. They've got your pensions for you,
[02:20:29.880 --> 02:20:33.560]  luxurious pensions if you work for the government, except that they're not funded.
[02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:39.000]  They have social security, except that's not funded either, right? That's a Ponzi scheme.
[02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:42.200]  We're going to have to open up our borders and bring people in. That's what they were telling us
[02:20:42.200 --> 02:20:46.760]  at the UN 20 years ago. You're not having enough kids, so we're going to have to bring kids in
[02:20:46.760 --> 02:20:50.760]  from other countries, and those kids will be happy to support you in your retirement.
[02:20:50.760 --> 02:20:57.000]  Yeah, right. If you think that the government is going to provide for you,
[02:20:57.880 --> 02:21:03.000]  that is the true slave mentality. That's what we need to wake up to. Forget what LeBron James is
[02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:09.560]  saying. The real slave mentality is the idea that we're going to just wave the team flag and we
[02:21:09.560 --> 02:21:14.600]  don't care how much money they're going to put us in bondage for to build a shiny new stadium
[02:21:14.600 --> 02:21:17.480]  for these billionaires. How many billions of dollars are we going to spend on a football
[02:21:17.480 --> 02:21:23.160]  team stadium? Or a minor league stadium or whatever, baseball stadium or hockey or baseball,
[02:21:23.160 --> 02:21:31.240]  whatever. It's the same game with all these different sports. We pay through the nose as
[02:21:31.240 --> 02:21:36.120]  slaves so we can watch these millionaires play a boys game in a stadium that is supposedly
[02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:38.920]  owned by the billionaires. They just get the profits. You and I get the bill.
[02:21:40.040 --> 02:21:44.440]  Here's an example of this. We've got Amazon, one of the best examples of
[02:21:44.440 --> 02:21:51.480]  elitism that we have in this country. Somebody who works on an Amazon film, Sneaky Pete,
[02:21:51.480 --> 02:21:55.880]  that's a good film. If you haven't seen a good TV series that they have on Amazon.
[02:21:56.440 --> 02:22:03.000]  This is a guy who is a grip working on Sneaky Pete. He came out about a week or two ago.
[02:22:03.640 --> 02:22:07.240]  Of course, he's having to live in his vehicle. He started living in his vehicle about four years
[02:22:07.240 --> 02:22:14.760]  ago, but he's got aspirations. Listen to this. His aspiration is not to move into a home.
[02:22:15.640 --> 02:22:21.960]  It's to move into a bigger vehicle soon. Isn't that sad? We've lowered our expectations.
[02:22:21.960 --> 02:22:25.560]  He's not looking for a three bedroom home. He's looking for a four door van,
[02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:32.680]  something a little bit bigger. Isn't that sad? We now have people who work for the world's
[02:22:32.680 --> 02:22:37.000]  richest man who's just been given billions and billions of subsidies in New York and Washington
[02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:44.680]  D.C. and the people who work on his productions. I mean, they're being paid like a migrant worker
[02:22:44.680 --> 02:22:51.080]  who's a fruit picker used to be paid. Exorbitant rents in L.A. because again,
[02:22:51.080 --> 02:22:57.640]  it's the failed policies of the Democrats there. Going back and looking at the 50 most expensive
[02:22:57.640 --> 02:23:03.400]  zip codes, I was absolutely amazed to see that all but about four were in California and those
[02:23:03.400 --> 02:23:11.320]  four were in New York. So they have priced homes out of reach for everybody. They have
[02:23:12.120 --> 02:23:16.680]  run Stockton into bankruptcy, but now Stockton is going to give everybody universal basic income.
[02:23:18.760 --> 02:23:24.120]  The only way this could be possible is if the people there are deliberately dumbed down.
[02:23:24.120 --> 02:23:28.360]  And voila, we see the article, least educated state California is number one
[02:23:28.360 --> 02:23:35.400]  in the least educated category. Number one in the percentage of residents 25 and older who
[02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:41.160]  never finished ninth grade, number 50, and high school graduates dead last.
[02:23:42.360 --> 02:23:47.240]  This is that kind of population that you can mandate vaccines, that you can tell people
[02:23:47.240 --> 02:23:51.960]  that they shouldn't have free speech, that corporations are allowed to censor you if they
[02:23:51.960 --> 02:23:57.160]  wish, because you know your human rights are subject to the whims of people like Jeff Bezos,
[02:23:57.160 --> 02:24:01.640]  Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, and others. If they decide that they want to shut down your free
[02:24:01.640 --> 02:24:06.600]  speech, they own the public square, as Jack Dorsey Twitter said. He said this is, you know,
[02:24:07.240 --> 02:24:11.080]  our business model is a public square. Twitter is a public square. He said it at least eight
[02:24:11.080 --> 02:24:20.280]  times publicly. And of course, the Supreme Court has said even if the public square is privately
[02:24:20.280 --> 02:24:26.200]  owned, you can't censor people. That was a Supreme Court decision back in 1946,
[02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:30.280]  Marsh versus Alabama. But we don't pay attention to that Supreme Court decision.
[02:24:30.280 --> 02:24:35.320]  We've got other Supreme Court decisions that are supposedly the law of the land that can never be
[02:24:35.320 --> 02:24:42.520]  altered like Roe v. Wade. And we can execute tens of millions of babies over that Supreme
[02:24:42.520 --> 02:24:47.560]  Court decision. But the Supreme Court decision that prevents corporations from executing your
[02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:55.240]  free speech, we don't, that doesn't have any authority here. Doesn't matter. That was exactly
[02:24:55.240 --> 02:24:59.480]  what was happening. You had a woman, Jehovah's Witness, passing out religious literature
[02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:05.160]  in the public square. The whole town was owned by a corporation. They said we own everything,
[02:25:05.160 --> 02:25:09.000]  including the public square. And the Supreme Court said, sorry, if it's the public square,
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:14.600]  even if you own it privately, you can't censor free speech. It's a human right. But we've turned
[02:25:14.600 --> 02:25:19.800]  that human right over to the billionaires to dispose of as they wish, just like our income.
[02:25:19.800 --> 02:25:25.000]  And they can dumb us down. And quite frankly, if the people in California went to school longer,
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:31.320]  they'd be even dumber. It's not the number of years that they're spending in school. It's what
[02:25:31.320 --> 02:25:37.080]  they're being taught in the schools. It's really the problem in California. So yeah, if they were
[02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:41.720]  to stay there longer, it would only exacerbate the problem. We have a few wealthy individuals
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:47.000]  who are running everything. And the rest of these people, look at what's happening. And again,
[02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:52.840]  in this story, it was on The Drudge Report. It was a week or so ago, one person, Noelle 25. She
[02:25:52.840 --> 02:25:58.440]  only can use her first name because she signed a no publicity clause for one of her jobs. So you
[02:25:58.440 --> 02:26:05.720]  can't even tell people how poor they're making you. Tennessee Ernie Ford, yeah, I owe my soul
[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:11.400]  to the company store, to Amazon, or whatever studio that she's working for. They're embarrassed
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:14.680]  about the fact they don't pay her anything. So don't tell anybody your last name. We don't want
[02:26:14.680 --> 02:26:21.160]  to know how poor we've made you, how we wiped out the middle class. And of course, part of this
[02:26:22.040 --> 02:26:28.760]  is the deliberate policies of the people who want open borders. Send us your children from
[02:26:28.760 --> 02:26:33.320]  Mexico, Honduras, every country in the world. Send us your children. We'll educate them for free
[02:26:33.320 --> 02:26:39.640]  at the expense of the people who used to have a home here in America. They used to be the American
[02:26:39.640 --> 02:26:46.280]  Dream owning a home. You can't own a home if you got to pay property taxes to pay for the education
[02:26:46.280 --> 02:26:52.040]  of every child on earth who comes here. And there is no limit. They're not putting any limits on
[02:26:52.040 --> 02:26:57.800]  the number of people that can be educated at your expense, at the expense of your home, at the expense
[02:26:57.800 --> 02:27:06.920]  of your American Dream. And they very cleverly call these illegal aliens who are of the age
[02:27:06.920 --> 02:27:11.320]  that they need to be educated at your expense. They call them dreamers. Oh, they have dreams,
[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:15.880]  but you don't. You don't have an American Dream. Only they have the American, only they have a dream
[02:27:15.880 --> 02:27:21.880]  of an education at your expense, at the expense of your American Dream home. So this person, Noelle
[02:27:21.880 --> 02:27:31.960]  25, one of 15,748 people in Los Angeles currently living in his or her vehicle. As of January
[02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:43.640]  2018, 9,117 vehicles are being used as homes in LA. And that's up from 600 in 2017. Who knows where
[02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:49.320]  it is this year or what will happen when things get tougher economically this next year. So they
[02:27:49.320 --> 02:27:59.560]  went from 600 in 2017 to 9,000 in 2018. People living out of their vehicles. But don't worry,
[02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:04.840]  they've got plans to take away your vehicle as well. I'm serious. This is what they're talking
[02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:12.520]  about, the UN agenda for smart cities. And it's all being done with the mask of being green,
[02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:17.960]  behind the green mask. Remember Rosa Corey exposing agenda 21? Well, they've gotten more
[02:28:17.960 --> 02:28:23.640]  specific about agenda 21. It's no longer a UN agenda for something that's going to happen to us
[02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:31.400]  all in the 21st century. Now it is more specific in terms of time. It's now the UN 2030 agenda.
[02:28:32.040 --> 02:28:39.320]  That 2030 number just keeps coming up every time they talk about the future, our new dystopian
[02:28:39.320 --> 02:28:45.320]  Orwellian future. We'll tell you about that and how that meshes with Alexandria occasional
[02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:57.720]  Cortex's dream of a new green deal. We'll be right back. Stay with us. Bacon lovers, we ship free.

[02:29:25.080 --> 02:29:29.320]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my
[02:29:29.320 --> 02:29:34.600]  mother's house. I sued the IRS and won. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:29:34.600 --> 02:29:38.600]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[02:29:38.600 --> 02:29:43.320]  they thought might never be solved. I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't
[02:29:43.320 --> 02:29:48.920]  wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case. Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to
[02:29:48.920 --> 02:29:54.040]  my website, danpilla.com. That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[02:29:56.120 --> 02:30:00.680]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[02:30:01.640 --> 02:30:06.840]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the
[02:30:06.840 --> 02:30:12.520]  emperor has no clothes that can call BS, it's game over. But if you look at everybody else
[02:30:12.520 --> 02:30:17.320]  like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholded
[02:30:17.320 --> 02:30:24.280]  to the networks they're on that can be targeted. There's only two groups in the U.S., Info Wars and
[02:30:24.280 --> 02:30:29.400]  Matt Drudge of drudgereport.com that are truly independent and of course they're two of the
[02:30:29.400 --> 02:30:35.640]  dominant media forces in the world. It really is amazing. That's why as we close out 2018,
[02:30:35.640 --> 02:30:38.840]  I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've
[02:30:38.840 --> 02:30:42.520]  come together. Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will

[02:32:59.560 --> 02:33:02.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:02.280 --> 02:33:14.920]  What I hate is looking up and seeing chemtrails in a clear blue sky today.
[02:33:20.040 --> 02:33:23.960]  What I hate is... All right, let's talk about the green deal
[02:33:24.680 --> 02:33:30.840]  from occasional cortex. Let's begin by looking at the left
[02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:35.800]  press. I'm talking about The Guardian, The Huffington Post. This last week they had...
[02:33:36.360 --> 02:33:41.880]  They're all putting out stories that they thought was so funny. They have a blind creature that
[02:33:41.880 --> 02:33:48.200]  buries its head in the sand and it's going to be named after President Trump. That's a headline for
[02:33:48.200 --> 02:33:55.320]  both these. They use the same headline. They said they discovered a blind and burrowing amphibian
[02:33:55.320 --> 02:33:59.800]  and so they had to come up with a name for it. So they named it after President Trump. They called it
[02:33:59.800 --> 02:34:09.160]  Dermafus Donald Trumpy and the name was chosen by the boss of a green company called EnviroBuild.
[02:34:10.280 --> 02:34:17.160]  They are a sustainable building materials company. They paid $25,000 in an auction so they could name
[02:34:17.160 --> 02:34:22.600]  this blind amphibian that buries its head in the sand so they could name it after President Trump
[02:34:22.600 --> 02:34:28.600]  and troll him. EnviroBuild. And these are the people who, you know, when you look at this,
[02:34:28.600 --> 02:34:37.080]  paying $25,000 in an auction for the right to mock President Trump and to virtue signal to their
[02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:43.720]  Democrat patrons, you know, this is basically what H.L. Meakin said about an election. He says
[02:34:43.720 --> 02:34:50.920]  it's an advanced auction of stolen goods. These people will give money to their politicians
[02:34:50.920 --> 02:34:58.360]  and they can get thousands of percent ROI. It's not just Jeff Bezos is doing it. He does it better
[02:34:58.360 --> 02:35:05.240]  than anybody else but this is the game that all these people play. Whether it's Cylindra or whether
[02:35:05.240 --> 02:35:11.240]  it's EnviroBuild or whatever, they can give money to these politicians and then the politicians will
[02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:15.800]  turn over contracts to them that are a thousand times bigger than the amount of money that they
[02:35:15.800 --> 02:35:21.480]  gave to those politicians. And as the Guardian is pointing out, he said the only event that
[02:35:21.480 --> 02:35:26.600]  Trump's administration put on at the recent UN climate summit in Poland was to extol the virtues
[02:35:26.600 --> 02:35:33.240]  of fossil fuels. Good for him. Trump and the Poles were trolling these people who went right into
[02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:40.600]  the heart of Europe's coal production and the city that was at the heart of Poland's coal production.
[02:35:40.600 --> 02:35:45.640]  And they actually put up exhibits there extolling the virtues of coal and President Trump's Senate
[02:35:45.640 --> 02:35:51.640]  delegation there to do the same thing. And it really made them furious. And then as you had them
[02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:57.800]  talking about global warming, they had a massive snowstorm there. The Al Gore Effect, as Martin
[02:35:57.800 --> 02:36:02.600]  Morano pointed out, but they go on to say the co-founder of this company, EnviroBuild, said
[02:36:02.600 --> 02:36:07.720]  EnviroBuild is not an overtly political organization, but we do feel strongly that everyone
[02:36:07.720 --> 02:36:11.880]  should do everything they can to leave the world in a better way than they found it. Come on.
[02:36:11.880 --> 02:36:20.520]  This guy is nothing but a fascist, subsidy-seeking, crony capitalist who, again, is trying to virtue
[02:36:20.520 --> 02:36:27.000]  signal to his patrons there in the Democrat Party. He goes on to say, as this thing is an
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:31.720]  amphibian, it is particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change and is therefore in
[02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:38.280]  danger of becoming extinct. But not to be outdone. Occasional Cortex tells us that we are all going
[02:36:38.280 --> 02:36:47.720]  to die. People are going to die, she says, unless her new green new deal is passed. So Americans
[02:36:47.720 --> 02:36:53.240]  are dying already. Either way, we face cataclysmic climate disaster unless Congress can plan and
[02:36:53.240 --> 02:36:58.200]  implement a green new deal in 10 years. Well, 10 years ago, we were told by Al Gore that all the
[02:36:58.200 --> 02:37:04.360]  polarized caps were going to be melting. It didn't happen. Just give us a little bit more time.
[02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:09.240]  Let's wait another 10 years before we take drastic measures and let's see how your predictions
[02:37:09.240 --> 02:37:14.920]  point out by that point in time. We've already seen that they failed, that your models are
[02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:22.520]  failing based on bad data, bad models. We've had enough time. It takes a while with climate
[02:37:22.520 --> 02:37:26.360]  predictions. It doesn't like weather. We can tell in a day or two if they don't know what they're
[02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:32.040]  talking about. But with climate, you've got to go a few years or decades. Let's not rush into this
[02:37:32.040 --> 02:37:38.040]  thing here. Again, they point out that it was just a decade ago, we had Van Jones,
[02:37:38.840 --> 02:37:42.760]  that's Breitbart, pointing out the green collar economy. He was telling the same thing, right?
[02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:49.720]  How one solution can fix our two biggest problems. And we have to have higher fuel prices to avoid
[02:37:49.720 --> 02:37:53.960]  a climate catastrophe is what Van Jones is saying at the time. It was published a month before
[02:37:53.960 --> 02:38:00.360]  Barack Obama won the 2008 election. Jones went on to be the green jobs czar of Obama.
[02:38:00.360 --> 02:38:09.240]  So actually the green New Deal is not new at all. It's recycled socialism from Van Jones and Obama.
[02:38:09.240 --> 02:38:15.240]  But now it's getting more traction because they've just won the House. Around the same time, 2008,
[02:38:15.240 --> 02:38:20.760]  10 years ago, New York Times columnists and British academic Richard Murphy introduced the
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:28.520]  phrase, the green New Deal. See, occasional cortex doesn't even have any new phrases. Even green
[02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:35.080]  New Deal is 10 years old. The idea is old, the science has failed, but they're going to use it
[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:41.640]  to try to reorganize our society. Gonna have to have economic stimulus to stimulate renewable
[02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:45.960]  energy industries. You know, things like Cylindra, that was so successful, we need to do more of
[02:38:45.960 --> 02:38:52.920]  that. As a daily caller points out, this could be the largest expansion of government in decades.
[02:38:52.920 --> 02:38:57.480]  And the House Democrats are all lining up behind occasional cortex pretending that they've just
[02:38:57.480 --> 02:39:02.200]  now discovered this and look at this. This is new and fashionable, even though it's a very old idea.
[02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:07.160]  But it's going to cost us tens of trillions of dollars. 40 Democrats in Congress have already
[02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:13.960]  lined up behind occasional cortex. And they said, as daily caller points out, if we figure out how
[02:39:13.960 --> 02:39:18.280]  much what's in this and how much it's going to cost, will people still support it? They're talking
[02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:24.360]  about spending $5.2 trillion over two decades. These are the people who will shut down Washington
[02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:32.120]  over $5 billion with a B, $5 billion for 10% of the wall. They want to spend over the next
[02:39:32.760 --> 02:39:40.440]  two decades $5.2 trillion to have 100% renewable electric grid. You know, as we talked about
[02:39:40.440 --> 02:39:46.600]  this to people, I remember David Schneer, he worked for 30 years for the EPA. And he joined
[02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:53.400]  the EPA when the EPA was focused on cleaning up toxic waste. And then when they became about
[02:39:54.280 --> 02:39:58.520]  shutting down entire industries and rewarding other industries, he said, I'm out. He became a
[02:39:58.520 --> 02:40:02.760]  whistleblower. And he would go around and talk to people about energy. And he would ask the
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:07.240]  audience. It's very interesting. He would ask the audience, what is your favorite source of energy?
[02:40:07.240 --> 02:40:13.560]  And he said, there were always several people who would say electricity. Electricity is an
[02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:20.680]  end product. It doesn't, it's the form that the energy is transferred to you. You generate the
[02:40:20.680 --> 02:40:28.040]  electricity with fossil fuels, or in some cases with renewables like solar, except there's no
[02:40:28.680 --> 02:40:32.440]  reasonable way to store that right now on the grid. Yeah, you can do it on individually,
[02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:36.200]  but there's no reasonable way to store it on the grid. But they've got a solution.
[02:40:36.200 --> 02:40:41.880]  Remember when they hit Volkswagen with tens of billions of dollars of fines and other things
[02:40:41.880 --> 02:40:46.680]  because they cheated on their emissions test? Nobody died. You know, we've had automakers who
[02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:51.160]  have cynically removed equipment and nothing really happened. And they got hit with a million
[02:40:51.160 --> 02:40:55.560]  dollar fines or something. But Volkswagen, they almost took out of business and they've locked
[02:40:55.560 --> 02:41:02.040]  up a Volkswagen executive because they cheated on an emissions test, right, for the EPA.
[02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:07.320]  And now we find, I saw this in Karn Drive very quietly, the first time I've ever seen any
[02:41:07.320 --> 02:41:13.400]  reference to this, there is now an organization called Electrify America. How did they fund that?
[02:41:14.200 --> 02:41:20.280]  It's funded with billions of dollars that were taken from Volkswagen. So they come in and say,
[02:41:20.280 --> 02:41:25.160]  you cheated on your emission test, four billion dollar fine, and then we got other things were
[02:41:25.160 --> 02:41:33.560]  kind of, then they take that money and they're going to use it to put in charging stations across
[02:41:33.560 --> 02:41:41.720]  America. After they told Volkswagen very quickly, you stop selling reliable, economical, durable,
[02:41:41.720 --> 02:41:46.280]  diesel engines, even though you can make them clean, you stop selling those or we're going to
[02:41:46.280 --> 02:41:50.200]  put you out of business. And they very quickly came out with electric cars. And now this money
[02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:56.520]  that they had extorted from them, I should say, basically highway robbery, that's going to be used
[02:41:56.520 --> 02:42:03.080]  to pay for an infrastructure. Because they won't build roads, I don't know what we're going to
[02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:07.480]  be driving, even though you might have an electric car, but you still have to have a road
[02:42:08.120 --> 02:42:13.240]  and fill the potholes, a road that is enough levels, because we can't make them any wider,
[02:42:13.240 --> 02:42:17.160]  we need to start making them levels. That's one thing that Elon Musk got right, you got to go
[02:42:17.160 --> 02:42:22.200]  3D with the roads, whether you go down or whether you go up, everybody's always known that. If you
[02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:26.840]  don't build the roads in a 3D manner, then we're not going to be able, nobody's going to be moving
[02:42:26.840 --> 02:42:32.120]  regardless of what the engine or the motor that's being used. But if you look at what's going on
[02:42:32.120 --> 02:42:36.040]  in London, and we'll talk a little bit more about this on the other side, we see what the end game
[02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:42.200]  is. London Mayor Sadiq Khan is now going to phase out the congestion charges. See, first they were
[02:42:42.200 --> 02:42:46.920]  going to have low emission zones. Oh, you're not going to be allowed in the city unless you've got
[02:42:46.920 --> 02:42:51.480]  virtually zero emissions. Now it's about congestion and they're even going to come
[02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:57.640]  after the electric cars. We'll be right back. The globalists are trying to set up a private
[02:42:57.640 --> 02:43:03.000]  corporate world government that's above the law. If there's any opposition, if there's any independent
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:09.240]  media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:14.840]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and
[02:43:14.840 --> 02:43:18.600]  Sean Hannity, they are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:43:19.480 --> 02:43:24.760]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Info Wars and Matt Drudge of drudgereport.com
[02:43:25.480 --> 02:43:29.880]  that are truly independent. And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:43:30.520 --> 02:43:36.120]  It really is amazing. That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the
[02:43:36.120 --> 02:43:40.200]  amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together. Just remind you that you are the power,

[02:46:55.640 --> 02:47:01.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:17.880 --> 02:47:21.400]  All right, folks, just a little bit more about travel and I want to get to President Trump and
[02:47:21.400 --> 02:47:26.920]  what's going on in the White House and with the Federal Reserve. I got a lot to cover in this
[02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:31.560]  last segment of the show and coming up in the next hour, we have Rodgerstone will be hosting
[02:47:31.560 --> 02:47:36.840]  in the fourth hour of the show. Real quickly, we have an end of year total store clearance
[02:47:36.840 --> 02:47:41.400]  at infowarsstore.com. You know you're going to be thinking about your health. Everybody does
[02:47:41.400 --> 02:47:45.400]  the beginning of the new year. Everybody makes resolutions about how they're going to eat better,
[02:47:45.400 --> 02:47:49.640]  how they're going to take better care of themselves, exercise and so forth. Now's a good time to get
[02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:53.240]  started on this. We're trying to clear out our inventory before the first of the year
[02:47:53.240 --> 02:48:00.360]  and so we've continued our massive Christmas sale and extended increased much of it in
[02:48:00.360 --> 02:48:06.600]  order to clear out our inventory before the end of the year. We have 50, 60% off many different
[02:48:06.600 --> 02:48:11.640]  items, some of them up to 75% off. We have free shipping storewide, a free t-shirt with every
[02:48:11.640 --> 02:48:17.000]  order and double patriot points that'll get you discounts on future orders. But think about
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:23.240]  this. We've talked about this in terms of Christmas gifts before many people get entertaining
[02:48:23.240 --> 02:48:28.760]  things, games, clothes, things like that. But think about what you can do for your health.
[02:48:28.760 --> 02:48:33.560]  And this is the time of year that people start to think about this as the calendar rolls over.
[02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:39.320]  It's a good way to help your family and your friends if you're giving gifts. And of course that
[02:48:39.320 --> 02:48:44.440]  time has passed now, but you can still not too late to help them to be more proactive
[02:48:44.440 --> 02:48:47.560]  about taking care of their health. Everybody's thinking about that at the beginning of the
[02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:53.240]  year and there's no better time than right now. We've never had discounts this deep,
[02:48:53.240 --> 02:49:00.120]  this broad at the store. Again, up to 75% off items at infowarstore.com, free shipping storewide,
[02:49:00.120 --> 02:49:04.360]  double patriot points and even a free t-shirt with every order at infowarstore.com.
[02:49:05.480 --> 02:49:08.680]  All right, real quickly, just to finish up on this transportation stuff, as I was saying,
[02:49:08.680 --> 02:49:15.720]  we have all the people that have come to us with these green mandates. And they would say things
[02:49:15.720 --> 02:49:22.520]  like, well, you've got to have a less CO2 emission and so forth, higher mileage mandates you've got
[02:49:22.520 --> 02:49:28.360]  in London and other places across Europe. They have these ultra low emission zones,
[02:49:28.360 --> 02:49:34.360]  you'd not be allowed in if you don't have an extremely low emission car. In other words,
[02:49:34.360 --> 02:49:39.160]  something that's like a hybrid or an electric car, they really hit you with a large fine.
[02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:44.040]  Each day that you drive in, it's going to be things like $16 a day to get into London.
[02:49:45.160 --> 02:49:51.880]  But predictably, it's no longer about the economy, is it? It's about them taxing you,
[02:49:51.880 --> 02:49:57.080]  it's about them tracking you, it's about them having control over your transportation
[02:49:57.080 --> 02:50:00.920]  and making sure that you can't drive. Here's the evidence of it. London mayor,
[02:50:00.920 --> 02:50:06.040]  CityCon is going to phase out the congestion charge. It was an emission charge. Now,
[02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:11.400]  it then became a congestion charge. And now he's going to phase out the exemption that they
[02:50:11.400 --> 02:50:16.520]  carved out for hybrid cars next year. And then they're going to phase out the exemption for
[02:50:16.520 --> 02:50:24.440]  electric cars, zero emission cars in 2025. So they're going to gradually take that out,
[02:50:24.440 --> 02:50:29.800]  even if you want to have a Uber or something like that, they're still going to tax that.
[02:50:29.800 --> 02:50:37.560]  $16 a day. So they don't want you to have even access to a car. And so when you look at what
[02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:43.640]  Google is doing up in Toronto, they call their smart city for dumb people. They call it sidewalk
[02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:47.000]  labs because you're going to be doing a lot of walking. You're not going to have a vehicle
[02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:51.400]  to get around. They don't want you to be mobile. They don't want you to have that kind of freedom.
[02:50:51.400 --> 02:50:55.320]  Washington DC is in on this as well, because this is a global initiative. This is coming
[02:50:55.320 --> 02:50:59.720]  from the United Nations. And guess what? All this stuff is going to be in place by 2030.
[02:51:00.520 --> 02:51:05.560]  By 2032, I said DC is going to pass a bill to make the city run on 100% clean energy.
[02:51:06.360 --> 02:51:10.760]  This is what's happening everywhere. And Jerry Brown, I think, gave us an amazing
[02:51:10.760 --> 02:51:15.560]  nugget of truth. He said the Democrats are becoming too radical for the majority of voters.
[02:51:15.560 --> 02:51:20.520]  That is absolutely true. All right, just a little bit of time we've got left here. As I was looking
[02:51:20.520 --> 02:51:28.680]  at the various mainstream media, hammering President Trump because he started, he's there
[02:51:28.680 --> 02:51:34.200]  in the White House. He's not going to his home because of the shutdown and so forth. So he's
[02:51:34.200 --> 02:51:39.560]  taking calls from kids. Part of this thing with NORAD is tracking Santa Claus or whatever.
[02:51:40.280 --> 02:51:47.080]  And one kid calls in and he says, hello, is this Coleman? Merry Christmas. How old are you?
[02:51:47.080 --> 02:51:51.160]  Are you doing well in school? Do you still believe in Santa? The kid says, well, I'm seven years old.
[02:51:52.120 --> 02:51:59.480]  And he says, well, because at seven, it's marginal, right? Whether you believe in Santa Claus is like
[02:51:59.480 --> 02:52:03.640]  you're getting a little bit too old to believe in Santa Claus. So they're having a fit about this.
[02:52:03.640 --> 02:52:07.800]  All the people, oh, you shouldn't tell them that. Well, I guess the question is, if we talk about
[02:52:07.800 --> 02:52:14.280]  marginal beliefs, does the mainstream media still believe in Santa Claus? Do they still believe
[02:52:14.280 --> 02:52:20.760]  in quantitative easing? Do they still believe in the Federal Reserve? See, this is the real question
[02:52:20.760 --> 02:52:25.400]  that ought to be out there. President Trump should call them up and say, do you still believe in the
[02:52:25.400 --> 02:52:28.440]  Federal Reserve? Do you still believe they have America's best interests at heart? Do you still
[02:52:28.440 --> 02:52:34.120]  believe that they're trying to help us when they say, we've got to ratchet this economy down real
[02:52:34.120 --> 02:52:39.160]  hard? Got to have a hard landing because these people are about to grow at two or 3% a year.
[02:52:39.160 --> 02:52:46.600]  When they have allowed China to grow for 9.5% average a year for 40 years, 40 years. You just
[02:52:46.600 --> 02:52:50.840]  had the Chinese president bragging about that. Now, someone pointed out, did somebody slip
[02:52:50.840 --> 02:52:56.920]  Donald Trump some kind of political viagra? Yeah, well, maybe he just woke up to this stuff. Maybe
[02:52:56.920 --> 02:53:03.240]  he woke up to the fact that the establishment is against him. Folks, when we look at this,
[02:53:03.240 --> 02:53:10.120]  and we're talking, Trump really is the iconoclast that we need. And who is an iconoclast? Anybody
[02:53:10.120 --> 02:53:18.200]  that challenges cherished beliefs and venerated institutions like the Federal Reserve on the
[02:53:18.200 --> 02:53:26.120]  grounds that they are pernicious or an error. Oh, the Federal Reserve is both in error and pernicious.
[02:53:26.120 --> 02:53:30.520]  It just depends on your perspective. Are they grossly incompetent or are they pernicious and
[02:53:30.520 --> 02:53:37.400]  malicious in what they're doing? Bottom line is, folks, we need to get rid of calling ourselves.
[02:53:37.400 --> 02:53:43.800]  I don't call myself a conservative because I don't want to maintain, conserve, or preserve
[02:53:43.800 --> 02:53:49.000]  things like the Federal Reserve. There are certain things in our society that are like a cancer.
[02:53:49.800 --> 02:53:54.600]  The Federal Reserve is one of those. Created 105 years ago this last Friday. They did it
[02:53:55.240 --> 02:53:59.720]  at Christmas break when nobody was paying attention. And now just like the story that we
[02:53:59.720 --> 02:54:04.360]  saw this last week, the squatter who moved into a half million dollar home and said,
[02:54:04.360 --> 02:54:08.200]  I'm here. I'm an indigenous more and I'm taking this for reparations or whatever,
[02:54:08.200 --> 02:54:11.880]  the bogus reason. Fortunately, they had the police throw him out. A lot of times,
[02:54:11.880 --> 02:54:17.400]  police won't take any action on that. But we've had the Federal Reserve is essentially like the
[02:54:17.400 --> 02:54:23.640]  squatter. They have squatted on our country. And they're telling us that we can't get rid of them.
[02:54:24.200 --> 02:54:28.200]  And the sad thing about it is, the President Trump's, the people surrounding him, people
[02:54:28.200 --> 02:54:32.200]  like Steve Mnuchin who just kicked off what they call the Mnuchin Massacre. Yeah, it was
[02:54:32.200 --> 02:54:38.920]  a nightmare before Christmas and all through the house. He starts calling up the six big banks.
[02:54:38.920 --> 02:54:43.400]  You know, we got six big banks, the big banks that are too big to fail, too big to jail. These
[02:54:43.400 --> 02:54:49.240]  are the banks, by the way, that were created by Bill Clinton and his administration when they
[02:54:49.240 --> 02:54:53.800]  got rid of the Glass-Digel Act. When they approved the merger of Bank of America and Nations Bank
[02:54:53.800 --> 02:55:00.200]  because he had a chief of staff that was, you know, part of that industry right there in North
[02:55:00.200 --> 02:55:04.760]  Carolina, Erskine Bowls. Nevertheless, they put that through and everybody said, you're going to
[02:55:04.760 --> 02:55:08.280]  create a wave of mergers. You're going to wind up with just a few big banks. And sure enough,
[02:55:08.280 --> 02:55:12.440]  they did. And guess what? Those big banks did. They worked with the Federal Reserve to destroy
[02:55:12.440 --> 02:55:17.640]  our economy. And so, yeah, you got six banks. And so, Steve Mnuchin was calling them up and
[02:55:17.640 --> 02:55:21.640]  saying, you know, don't worry, everything's going to, you're okay, right? You're liquid, right?
[02:55:21.640 --> 02:55:26.920]  And he puts it out that the Plunge Protection Team is going to protect the stock market.
[02:55:26.920 --> 02:55:31.480]  And they started telling people, don't worry, I've talked to all the banks and they said,
[02:55:31.480 --> 02:55:34.760]  they're doing really well. And as one commenter pointed out, they said, that's kind of like,
[02:55:35.320 --> 02:55:38.600]  that's worrying. Like, if you were to go to the doctor and you have some tests made and the
[02:55:38.600 --> 02:55:43.640]  doctor calls you up and say, well, I can't tell you about it right now, but don't worry. I don't
[02:55:43.640 --> 02:55:48.040]  think it's cancer. And anything that is that kind of cancer, we've got some treatments for it that
[02:55:48.040 --> 02:55:54.120]  sometimes work. That's basically what Steve Mnuchin did, crashed the market. And now the same
[02:55:54.120 --> 02:56:01.240]  Steve Mnuchin is the one that is telling President Trump that you, telling everybody,
[02:56:01.240 --> 02:56:07.240]  President Trump did not suggest firing the Fed chair. And his new chief of staff,
[02:56:07.240 --> 02:56:11.720]  Mick Mulvaney, is saying, the president now realizes that he doesn't have the ability to
[02:56:11.720 --> 02:56:20.120]  fire Powell. No, he does. He really does. If you look at the Federal Reserve Act, it says for cause.
[02:56:21.080 --> 02:56:25.400]  And again, when we talk about people having employment, you either have at will or you
[02:56:25.400 --> 02:56:32.200]  got a contract, right? If you've got a contract, then they can't get rid of you unless there's
[02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:39.240]  misconduct or unless there is a, you're fired for cause. What is firing for cause? Well,
[02:56:39.240 --> 02:56:44.680]  if you look at what they tell people in employment contracts in terms of state law,
[02:56:44.680 --> 02:56:48.680]  in terms of national law, when they talk to employers, they say, well, for cause is somebody
[02:56:48.680 --> 02:56:55.400]  that is not doing what they were supposed to do, right? Misconduct is not the same thing
[02:56:55.400 --> 02:57:00.920]  as cause. Cause is understood to mean for good reason. Misconduct is something like criminal
[02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:08.680]  behavior. So what you're hearing from the people is that you can't fire the Fed for cause because
[02:57:08.680 --> 02:57:15.400]  he hasn't committed any crimes or he hasn't, you know, molested some girls on a casting couch,
[02:57:15.400 --> 02:57:19.800]  like Weinstein has. No, it doesn't anything to do with that. That would be misconduct.
[02:57:19.800 --> 02:57:26.920]  Misconduct is sometimes explicitly stated in the for cause part of a contract so that
[02:57:26.920 --> 02:57:32.280]  they can get rid of them for that as well. But for cause simply means that you have been doing
[02:57:32.280 --> 02:57:37.800]  things that harm the thing that you're supposed to be working on, not working. He could fire him
[02:57:37.800 --> 02:57:42.440]  for that, but he should audit them. And you need to call President Trump and tell him that you
[02:57:42.440 --> 02:57:47.560]  support him because the rest of Washington doesn't. The globalists are trying to set up a private
[02:57:47.560 --> 02:57:52.920]  corporate world government that's above the law. If there's any opposition or there's any independent
[02:57:52.920 --> 02:57:59.160]  media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, they can call BS if game over.
[02:58:00.200 --> 02:58:04.680]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[02:58:04.680 --> 02:58:08.520]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:58:09.400 --> 02:58:14.680]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Info Wars and Matt Drudge of drudgereport.com
[02:58:15.400 --> 02:58:19.800]  that are truly independent. And of course, there are two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:58:20.520 --> 02:58:26.040]  It really is amazing. That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the
[02:58:26.040 --> 02:58:30.200]  amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together. Just remind you that you are the power,

[03:00:09.480 --> 03:00:19.080]  Welcome back. That's right. I'm Roger Stone and you're on the most talked about show on the net,
[03:00:19.080 --> 03:00:25.960]  the Alex Jones show. Why is it the globalists and the two-party duopoly that have run this country
[03:00:25.960 --> 03:00:33.080]  into the gutter are so hysterical to ban InfoWars and snuff the Alex Jones show?
[03:00:33.080 --> 03:00:41.000]  That's because we bring you the truth seven days a week. So you're in the right place. Buckle your
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:47.640]  seatbelt. We've got a great show for you. Now, just last week, you may have seen a raft of fake
[03:00:47.640 --> 03:00:53.880]  news stories regarding a legal settlement that I reached with a Chinese billionaire
[03:00:54.600 --> 03:01:00.440]  who is fighting extradition to his home country where he is wanted for financial crimes.
[03:01:00.440 --> 03:01:07.000]  This is one of the greatest smears in American history because to be very clear,
[03:01:07.560 --> 03:01:16.600]  I have never broadcast or reported any story or any fact that I did not believe to be true at the
[03:01:16.600 --> 03:01:24.840]  time I reported it, not on InfoWars, not on any other platform. In this instance, some of the
[03:01:24.840 --> 03:01:31.000]  details of my report regarding this businessman turned out to be incorrect. That's because I
[03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:38.360]  relied on a source who just turned out to be wrong. And unlike the Washington Post, unlike the Wall
[03:01:38.360 --> 03:01:48.040]  Street Journal, unlike CNN, unlike MSNBC, when we make an error here at InfoWars, we quickly
[03:01:48.040 --> 03:01:56.280]  correct it. That's what real journalists do. But every single one of these mainstream media outlets
[03:01:56.280 --> 03:02:04.280]  led with a headline that says Roger and Stone admits lying on InfoWars. No, I never said anything
[03:02:04.280 --> 03:02:12.760]  of the kind. And in the settlement, by the way, I was sued for $100 million. I paid zero,
[03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:19.720]  but I issued a retraction and an apology built around two key points. I said the businessman
[03:02:19.720 --> 03:02:25.640]  in question had been a bundler for Hillary Clinton. That turns out to have been a misreading of the
[03:02:25.640 --> 03:02:32.120]  Federal Election Commission report by none other than Sam Nunberg. And also that he was
[03:02:32.120 --> 03:02:38.200]  financing a presidential campaign for Steve Bannon. I was incorrect about that. He's
[03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:46.360]  financing a nonprofit for Steve Bannon as reported in The New York Times for $100 million. Funny,
[03:02:46.360 --> 03:02:53.160]  the same amount that I was sued for. That was a page one story in The New York Times only days ago.
[03:02:54.120 --> 03:03:00.520]  And of course, I said that Mr. Kwok was wanted both in China and here for financial crimes,
[03:03:00.520 --> 03:03:06.840]  when in fact, he's only wanted in China for alleged financial crimes. So our apologies,
[03:03:06.840 --> 03:03:12.520]  but unlike the mainstream media, we correct when we're wrong. It's not often, but it happens.
[03:03:13.240 --> 03:03:19.640]  We have been proud of our track record here at InfoWars of bringing you tomorrow's news today.
[03:03:19.640 --> 03:03:24.760]  We've had a series of breaking stories over the last two years. It is kind of interesting that
[03:03:24.760 --> 03:03:30.360]  in the two years that I have been reporting for InfoWars, I have had to issue one retraction
[03:03:30.360 --> 03:03:37.640]  and one apology. That's what real journalists do. In any event, you're in the right place. It's the
[03:03:37.640 --> 03:03:43.320]  Alex Jones show. I want you to take a moment to go to the InfoWars.com site. We'll be back to talk
[03:03:43.320 --> 03:03:47.960]  about this, but I want to remind you, we are completely and totally listener and viewers
[03:03:47.960 --> 03:03:53.400]  supported. Therefore, if you don't go to the site and load up on our very best products,
[03:03:53.400 --> 03:03:58.440]  whether it is a nutraceutical, a t-shirt, a book or anything else, a water filter,
[03:03:58.440 --> 03:04:04.440]  well, then we can't continue to expand and continue the fight against the deep state,
[03:04:04.440 --> 03:04:10.600]  the globalist, George Soros and others who would put us out of business, who would snuff out
[03:04:10.600 --> 03:04:17.160]  this very broadcast. So please give us your support. We need it more than ever before.
[03:04:17.160 --> 03:04:24.840]  A lot of people think that Alex Jones and I cry wolf that we are exaggerating the hazardous days
[03:04:24.840 --> 03:04:32.840]  ahead. That's not true. InfoWars faces multi-million-dollar bogus harassment lawsuits that they use
[03:04:32.840 --> 03:04:39.960]  as an excuse to censor us. Please have our back because we have yours. I'll be right back.
[03:04:39.960 --> 03:04:58.600]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[03:04:59.560 --> 03:05:04.600]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that
[03:05:04.600 --> 03:05:10.440]  the emperor has no clothes that can call BS, it's game over. But if you look at everybody else,
[03:05:10.440 --> 03:05:15.240]  like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholded
[03:05:15.240 --> 03:05:21.880]  to the networks they're on that can be targeted. There's only two groups in the U.S. InfoWars
[03:05:21.880 --> 03:05:27.240]  and Matt Rudge of rudgereport.com that are truly independent. And of course, they're two of the
[03:05:27.240 --> 03:05:33.560]  dominant media forces in the world. It really is amazing. That's why as we close out 2018,
[03:05:33.560 --> 03:05:36.920]  I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come
[03:05:36.920 --> 03:05:40.440]  together. Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will
[03:05:41.560 --> 03:05:47.800]  of InfoWars. So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswars.com, christenpana.com.
[03:05:47.800 --> 03:05:51.800]  Because if you don't spread the articles in the videos, no one else will. We're all in each
[03:05:51.800 --> 03:06:14.600]  other's hands. God bless you all and thank you. Welcome back. That's right. You're on the Alex
[03:06:14.600 --> 03:06:21.000]  Jones show. The most talked about, the most controversial and the most news busting story
[03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:27.240]  on the, or I should say program, on the net and on your local radio station. We're proud of the
[03:06:27.240 --> 03:06:33.880]  work we do here. We're the Paul Revere of the American political revolution that has taken
[03:06:33.880 --> 03:06:41.080]  place under President Donald Trump. It's amazing to sit back here and watch the spasms and hysteria
[03:06:41.080 --> 03:06:47.000]  of the far left. You see, when I first got involved in politics, the left was against war.
[03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:53.160]  The conservatives were for war, certainly against the war against the communists in Southeast Asia.
[03:06:53.160 --> 03:06:59.080]  And let's face it, if President Barack Obama had ended the war in Syria, well, they'd be
[03:06:59.080 --> 03:07:05.720]  nominating him for another Nobel Peace Prize. But because Donald Trump has kept faith with the
[03:07:05.720 --> 03:07:12.280]  American people, because he has kept his pledge to get us withdrawn from endless foreign war that
[03:07:12.280 --> 03:07:17.800]  cost us billions, not to mention American lives. Well, we're against anything the president do,
[03:07:17.800 --> 03:07:24.200]  does, and that includes making peace. It is disgraceful. It's amazing how Donald Trump has
[03:07:24.200 --> 03:07:30.840]  stuck to his guns when it comes to the withdrawal from Syria, bringing our troop levels in Afghanistan
[03:07:30.840 --> 03:07:37.640]  down by 50% on the way to bringing them to zero. Exactly what he told the American people he would
[03:07:37.640 --> 03:07:46.040]  do when he ran as a non-interventionist candidate for president. And now he is hanging tough on
[03:07:46.040 --> 03:07:53.240]  the wall in a way that few could have forecast. The thing about Donald Trump, a man I have known
[03:07:53.240 --> 03:08:00.680]  for 40 years, is that he's an inordinately stubborn individual. And I say that in a positive sense.
[03:08:00.680 --> 03:08:07.400]  What I mean is, when the president puts his mind to a goal, he will not be taken off of it. He will
[03:08:07.400 --> 03:08:13.880]  not be distracted. He will not fold. And I am convinced that he will let the government shutdown
[03:08:13.880 --> 03:08:21.400]  go as long as it needs to until the Congress folds and gives him the funding for a wall.
[03:08:21.400 --> 03:08:28.200]  Do we really need a wall? Take a look at what's going on in Europe, even as we speak.
[03:08:28.200 --> 03:08:34.760]  Take a look at what's going on in France, in Belgium, in Germany, in Paris specifically.
[03:08:34.760 --> 03:08:42.280]  Tell me that that tidal wave of terrorism, of rape, of murder, of assault, of peace-loving citizens
[03:08:42.280 --> 03:08:50.360]  is not headed this way. That is the wave of the future if we allow unfettered open borders
[03:08:50.360 --> 03:08:56.760]  and let anyone come into the country who wants to. If you do not have borders, you do not have a
[03:08:56.760 --> 03:09:03.400]  country, as the president has said, throughout his campaign. Now let's go to another story that I
[03:09:03.400 --> 03:09:09.560]  know a lot of info warriors are most interested in. And that is the fate of Broward County Sheriff,
[03:09:09.560 --> 03:09:16.120]  Scott Israel. Now, right up front, I want to say that I supported Scott Israel for Sheriff the
[03:09:16.120 --> 03:09:22.440]  second time he ran because I learned that our local Broward County Florida Republican Sheriff,
[03:09:22.440 --> 03:09:30.760]  Al Lamberti, had been corrupted by a Ponzi scammer named Scott Rothstein, who was using the Broward
[03:09:30.760 --> 03:09:38.440]  County Sheriff's Office as his personal Gestapo, and that he had corrupted the agency, was using
[03:09:38.440 --> 03:09:44.920]  it for his personal protection. We even learned that Sheriff Lamberti ordered the destruction
[03:09:44.920 --> 03:09:51.640]  with a hammer of two hard drives that contained evidence of his illicit relationship with the
[03:09:51.640 --> 03:09:59.320]  Ponzi scammer Rothstein. So I supported Scott Israel for Sheriff and I live to regret it.
[03:09:59.320 --> 03:10:05.480]  Then when the shooting at the Parkland High School went down, well, the Sheriff lied to my face
[03:10:05.480 --> 03:10:10.440]  about what happened. I should have listened to Alex Jones and others who told me that their
[03:10:10.440 --> 03:10:18.520]  analysis indicated that more than one officer had stood down. Now we have learned, based on an
[03:10:18.520 --> 03:10:24.840]  incredible story in the Miami Herald and then spreading elsewhere, that the official inquiry,
[03:10:24.840 --> 03:10:31.880]  one of two, indicates that at least six Broward County Sheriff's officers arrived at the Parkland
[03:10:31.880 --> 03:10:39.240]  High School, Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School, while there was still active shooting going on
[03:10:39.240 --> 03:10:45.960]  and that they stood down for 11 crucial minutes, minutes in which you could hear the ringing of
[03:10:45.960 --> 03:10:54.200]  gunshots and probable murder in the background. It is amazing to me that Governor-elect Ron
[03:10:54.200 --> 03:11:03.240]  DeSantis essentially ran on a platform pledging that he would remove the Sheriff. 77 members of
[03:11:03.240 --> 03:11:09.400]  the state legislature, all Republicans, co-signed a letter to Governor Rick Scott demanding the
[03:11:09.400 --> 03:11:15.480]  ouster of the Sheriff, but Scott has taken no action, preferring to appoint two different
[03:11:15.480 --> 03:11:21.960]  commissions to study exactly what happened. Well, now we know what happened and in a stunning
[03:11:21.960 --> 03:11:30.120]  editorial in today's Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel, a newspaper that frankly I very, very rarely agree
[03:11:30.120 --> 03:11:36.680]  with, we have learned even more. Not only is there the failure of leadership by Scott Israel in the
[03:11:36.680 --> 03:11:41.960]  Parkland High School shooting at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School, but there's also his
[03:11:41.960 --> 03:11:48.520]  mishandling of the shooting at the Fort Lauderdale International Airport. I must sadly admit that
[03:11:48.520 --> 03:11:56.680]  I agree it is time for Scott Israel to go. And Ron DeSantis said that he would have suspended the
[03:11:56.680 --> 03:12:03.000]  Sheriff, removed him, had he been Governor at the time of the shooting. Ron DeSantis, the Republican
[03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:09.880]  candidate now Governor-elect, appeared with Andrew Pollack, the father of one of the victims of the
[03:12:09.880 --> 03:12:17.480]  Parkland shooter, a man who lost tragically his daughter on that fateful day. Now, however,
[03:12:17.480 --> 03:12:24.840]  Ron DeSantis seems to be backing off his pledge to replace Sheriff Scott Israel. Let's take a look.
[03:12:26.200 --> 03:12:30.920]  Campaign, you said a number of times that if you had been Governor after the tragedy
[03:12:30.920 --> 03:12:36.120]  at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas, given the response of BSO, that you would have suspended,
[03:12:36.120 --> 03:12:41.320]  fired Sheriff Scott Israel. Well, on January 8th, you're going to be the Governor. Will you suspend
[03:12:41.320 --> 03:12:47.240]  him? Well, I also said that I would take stock of what's happened between the time I said that,
[03:12:47.240 --> 03:12:50.440]  and when I was Governor, because I didn't know what was happening, and there is going to be a
[03:12:50.440 --> 03:12:55.480]  report that is going to be presented to the public early in January. So I want to look at that.
[03:12:56.280 --> 03:13:02.600]  From what I've been told about it, there's a lot of really troubling facts about, really,
[03:13:02.600 --> 03:13:06.600]  this guy should not have been anywhere near that campus. He should have been brought to have been
[03:13:06.600 --> 03:13:10.200]  in the criminal system. So there's a whole bunch of problems, but let's get that out there and
[03:13:10.200 --> 03:13:16.360]  then we'll make a decision. Well, there you have it. Now, if anything, the information that has
[03:13:16.360 --> 03:13:22.600]  come to light since the shooting, since Mr. DeSantis was elected, Governor is even more troubling
[03:13:22.600 --> 03:13:29.320]  than what we knew before. So what will happen? Some people speculate that outgoing Governor,
[03:13:29.320 --> 03:13:37.080]  Rick Scott, will remove Scott Israel and appoint a replacement. Other people believe that Governor
[03:13:37.080 --> 03:13:44.040]  elect Ron DeSantis will replace Scott Israel and appoint a replacement, which I believe he has the
[03:13:44.040 --> 03:13:50.120]  authority to do, in which today's editorial in the Sun Central argues that he has the authority to
[03:13:50.120 --> 03:13:56.440]  do, although Israel might face a trial in the state Senate, which is in solidly Republican
[03:13:56.440 --> 03:14:02.680]  hands and could be counted on to remove him. And of course, there's a third theory, which is that
[03:14:02.680 --> 03:14:09.400]  DeSantis and Scott will do nothing and that Scott Israel will remain in office for two more years
[03:14:09.400 --> 03:14:15.480]  to face the wrath of the voters. There's a rumor about a poll going around in Broward County that
[03:14:15.480 --> 03:14:22.200]  shows that the sheriff is still very popular. Frankly, I doubt that. Having seen some survey
[03:14:22.200 --> 03:14:27.640]  research during the recent congressional race for a district that takes up most of Broward County,
[03:14:27.640 --> 03:14:35.960]  I found that he had a 69% unfavorable rating among all voters. I don't think he can stay the
[03:14:35.960 --> 03:14:43.400]  course. I must reluctantly conclude that Alex Jones and others like Laura Loomer were absolutely
[03:14:43.400 --> 03:14:51.160]  right. It's time for Sheriff Scott Israel to go. I hope Governor elect Ron DeSantis will keep his
[03:14:51.160 --> 03:14:57.800]  pledge to review this case and act aggressively to replace the leadership at the Broward County
[03:14:57.800 --> 03:15:04.120]  Sheriff's Office, which some of you may not know is the largest police force in the United States,
[03:15:04.120 --> 03:15:12.760]  a department with over 6,000 employees, almost 4,000 of whom are either law enforcement officers
[03:15:13.320 --> 03:15:19.160]  or firefighters. The people of Broward County, the taxpayers of Broward County,
[03:15:19.160 --> 03:15:26.360]  and the parents who lost children at Marjory, Stoneman, Douglas High School deserve nothing less.
[03:15:26.360 --> 03:15:41.160]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:15:41.160 --> 03:15:59.080]  Here that. That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[03:15:59.960 --> 03:16:05.560]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed. This year, resolve not to be the next victim

[03:16:24.360 --> 03:16:30.520]  Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world. George Washington had
[03:16:30.520 --> 03:16:37.160]  warned us against foreign wars. The United States of Empire shows that World Wars one and two left
[03:16:37.160 --> 03:16:43.400]  England broken. Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.400 --> 03:16:49.560]  Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War One, the United States of Empire,
[03:16:49.560 --> 03:16:56.040]  by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books. Pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten

[03:17:53.800 --> 03:18:00.680]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember, this life is a test, and those of you that have
[03:18:00.680 --> 03:18:05.000]  been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and
[03:18:05.000 --> 03:18:09.800]  Christianity coming back from the dead and recognizing it's being persecuted, that's all
[03:18:09.800 --> 03:18:14.920]  because you are the core, listening to M4 Wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty,
[03:18:14.920 --> 03:18:23.800]  that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming. Everybody knows who studies
[03:18:23.800 --> 03:18:29.240]  this, that it's Christians, real Christians who tend to be immune to the globalist brainwashing
[03:18:29.240 --> 03:18:33.960]  and who tend to see it, and that's why they're trying to eradicate you. But regardless,
[03:18:34.680 --> 03:18:41.400]  this fight is intensifying. 2018 has been insane. 2019 is going to be the big decision maker,
[03:18:41.400 --> 03:18:46.680]  and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me. Not behind us, but right beside us
[03:18:46.680 --> 03:18:50.600]  and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists. So whatever you do, take action and
[03:18:50.600 --> 03:18:56.120]  realize we're changing history together and I salute you. The globalists are trying to set up a
[03:18:56.120 --> 03:19:01.560]  private corporate world government that's above the law. If there's any opposition, if there's any
[03:19:01.560 --> 03:19:07.800]  independent media, they can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, they can call BS if
[03:19:07.800 --> 03:19:13.240]  came over. But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker
[03:19:13.240 --> 03:19:17.640]  Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[03:19:18.440 --> 03:19:25.240]  There's only two groups in the U.S. M4 Wars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com that are truly
[03:19:25.240 --> 03:19:29.880]  independent. And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world. It really
[03:19:29.880 --> 03:19:35.560]  is amazing. That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing
[03:19:35.560 --> 03:19:39.240]  fight we're all in and how far we've come together. Just remind you that you are the power,
[03:19:39.240 --> 03:19:45.560]  you're the strength, you're the will of M4 Wars. So please spread the links. M4Wars.com,
[03:19:45.560 --> 03:19:49.640]  news wars.com, christenpana.com. Because if you don't spread the articles in the videos,
[03:19:49.640 --> 03:20:06.120]  no one else will. We're all in each other's hands. God bless you all and thank you.
[03:20:20.200 --> 03:20:30.040]  And now, your host, Roger Stone. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm your host,
[03:20:30.040 --> 03:20:36.760]  Roger Stone. I was in Washington D.C. with Alex Jones and many, many other Trump supporters
[03:20:36.760 --> 03:20:43.960]  to celebrate the inauguration of our new president when a story hit page one of the New York Times.
[03:20:43.960 --> 03:20:51.080]  This story said that I was among three Trump advisors who was under Obama administration
[03:20:51.080 --> 03:20:58.680]  surveillance during the 2016 campaign. Well, we know that at least one of those other people was
[03:20:58.680 --> 03:21:07.720]  Carter Page. And of course, the story about the misuse of illicit FISA warrants to spy on Mr. Page
[03:21:07.720 --> 03:21:14.360]  has now been firmly established in the mainstream media, as well as the alternative media.
[03:21:14.360 --> 03:21:21.160]  And I can tell you that IT experts retained by my current attorneys can say to a certainty
[03:21:21.160 --> 03:21:26.840]  that I have been under government surveillance under Robert Mueller, the special counsel,
[03:21:26.840 --> 03:21:33.560]  for a little over, a little under two years. That means listening to all your phone calls,
[03:21:33.560 --> 03:21:40.120]  listening, monitoring your text messages and reading your emails, including those that have
[03:21:40.120 --> 03:21:45.320]  nothing to do with politics and business, but are intensely personal. You got to wonder,
[03:21:45.320 --> 03:21:50.440]  how can this kind of violation of my fourth amendment rights go on? Well, now I want to
[03:21:50.440 --> 03:21:55.480]  talk to you about an incredible case that is moving into the courts in which the crusading
[03:21:55.480 --> 03:22:03.080]  journalist Cheryl Atkinson is suing the Justice Department and the FBI because she learned
[03:22:03.080 --> 03:22:09.880]  due to her reporting about Fast and Furious, the gun-running scandal under Barack Obama,
[03:22:09.880 --> 03:22:16.360]  overseen by Attorney General Eric Holder, that the government remotely accessed all of her
[03:22:16.360 --> 03:22:23.320]  computer devices, reading all of her emails, and in some cases, actually monitoring her phone calls
[03:22:23.320 --> 03:22:29.960]  with whistleblower sources. This is not the first time the Obama administration monitored the
[03:22:29.960 --> 03:22:36.680]  activities of journalists. Some will remember that James Rosen, formerly of Fox News, covering
[03:22:36.680 --> 03:22:42.920]  the White House for that news organization, was monitored as well, reading his emails,
[03:22:42.920 --> 03:22:49.000]  listening to his phone calls. Why you might ask, how can this happen in America? Well,
[03:22:49.000 --> 03:22:55.560]  Cheryl Atkinson, who is an incredible journalist, is not taking this news, sitting down. She is
[03:22:55.560 --> 03:23:01.640]  moving into the courts with an aggressive lawsuit to challenge the government over the illicit,
[03:23:01.640 --> 03:23:11.880]  and I believe, illegal surveillance of her work. She is facing a daunting task because the government
[03:23:11.880 --> 03:23:21.160]  plays keepaway even when in discovery they are ordered to reveal things. They delay, they stall,
[03:23:21.160 --> 03:23:28.280]  they cover up, and in many cases, they lie. Cheryl Atkinson needs our support for this
[03:23:28.280 --> 03:23:35.720]  incredible lawsuit, and therefore, I urge those who are concerned about our Fourth Amendment rights
[03:23:35.720 --> 03:23:42.280]  and concerned about the Obama administration and the current FBI's constant illicit use of our
[03:23:42.280 --> 03:23:51.560]  intelligence services for domestic political spying to go to Cheryl Atkinson's GoFundMe site. She has
[03:23:51.560 --> 03:23:59.800]  raised a good $79,000. I think this is all by and large over the last month, but she needs our
[03:23:59.800 --> 03:24:07.640]  support today. So, keep tabs on this case. It's an important one, and if you can, give Cheryl
[03:24:07.640 --> 03:24:18.120]  Atkinson your support. She needs it and deserves it. Now, some of you may be familiar with a story
[03:24:18.120 --> 03:24:25.400]  that broke last Friday when we learned that the House Intelligence Committee voted to give my four
[03:24:25.400 --> 03:24:31.800]  hours of testimony transcript to Special Counsel Robert Muller. Some people may remember that I
[03:24:31.800 --> 03:24:37.000]  wanted my testimony to be in public from the beginning, and I was denied that right so that
[03:24:37.000 --> 03:24:43.240]  my testimony was taken behind closed doors. What people don't know is that even today,
[03:24:43.240 --> 03:24:49.320]  I am not permitted to have a copy of the transcript of my own testimony. My lawyers are entitled to
[03:24:49.320 --> 03:24:55.720]  go look at it in a controlled chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives, but they are not even
[03:24:55.720 --> 03:25:02.360]  allowed to take notes. It's quite extraordinary. Here's the key thing to remember, though, and that
[03:25:02.360 --> 03:25:09.240]  is that the House Intelligence Committee made this move having been egged on by Congressman Adam Schiff
[03:25:09.240 --> 03:25:15.720]  and his allies, Congressman Eric Swallow as well, Congressman Joaquin Castro, and others.
[03:25:16.360 --> 03:25:23.160]  The truth is they are the liars. My testimony is entirely truthful. Now, it's not inconceivable
[03:25:23.160 --> 03:25:31.000]  that I may have made inconsequential errors over a four and a half hour inquiry. I have over one
[03:25:31.000 --> 03:25:37.560]  million emails impossible for one individual to remember all of that, but at no time did I
[03:25:37.560 --> 03:25:43.960]  dissemble. What does this all really mean? I will tell you. It means they have no evidence of Russian
[03:25:43.960 --> 03:25:51.240]  collusion, no evidence of WikiLeaks' collaboration, no evidence whatsoever that I received anything,
[03:25:51.240 --> 03:25:58.120]  including allegedly hacked or allegedly stolen emails in advance of their publication by WikiLeaks.
[03:25:58.120 --> 03:26:04.200]  And in fact, I had no knowledge of the source or the content of those disclosures. Now,
[03:26:04.200 --> 03:26:11.160]  I disclosed to the House Intelligence Committee that Randy Kredico, a New York City talk show host,
[03:26:11.160 --> 03:26:17.240]  was the source that told me about both the significance and the October release date
[03:26:17.240 --> 03:26:23.400]  for the WikiLeaks' disclosures. Mr. Kredico has denied that repeatedly, mostly on MSNBC,
[03:26:23.400 --> 03:26:29.160]  who was given my forum every 15 minutes. The problem is that approximately 10 days ago,
[03:26:29.160 --> 03:26:36.280]  I released 80 total pages of text messages, 30 pages of which proved beyond dispute that Mr.
[03:26:36.280 --> 03:26:43.000]  Kredico was my source. Where will you find that? Not in the Wall Street Journal, not in the Daily
[03:26:43.000 --> 03:26:51.160]  Beast, not at Politico until my lawyers registered a formal complaint, not at the Washington Post,
[03:26:51.160 --> 03:26:57.640]  until they finally reported it only after another formal complaint from my attorneys.
[03:26:57.640 --> 03:27:04.760]  This is the game they play. At the end of the day, however, I don't know that the government wants
[03:27:04.760 --> 03:27:10.680]  to get into this. You see, one of the questions is about Henry Greenberg. Now, Henry Greenberg
[03:27:10.680 --> 03:27:17.880]  was a Russian, an ethnic Russian, but an American citizen who approached me in May of 2016,
[03:27:17.880 --> 03:27:24.120]  trying to sell me dirt on Hillary Clinton, an approach which I flatly turned down and left.
[03:27:24.120 --> 03:27:31.480]  But Henry Greenberg was and is an FBI informant. That is beyond dispute based on information that
[03:27:31.480 --> 03:27:38.840]  has been posted online, his actual informant visas that prove he was working for James Comey. So,
[03:27:38.840 --> 03:27:45.960]  what was he doing coming to see me in May of 2016? About the same time that an FBI asset was approaching
[03:27:45.960 --> 03:27:55.080]  George Papadopoulos, an FBI asset was approaching Carter Page. But we know that the formal investigation
[03:27:55.080 --> 03:28:03.720]  of Donald Trump's supposed ties to Russia didn't start until July of 2016. That means there had to
[03:28:03.720 --> 03:28:10.440]  be a preliminary investigation opened in order for their approach to me to be legal. When did that
[03:28:10.440 --> 03:28:17.400]  preliminary investigation start? Why does the Obama administration and the FBI and even the
[03:28:17.400 --> 03:28:24.680]  intelligence services today refuse to answer that question? This is the Pandora's box that would be
[03:28:24.680 --> 03:28:30.280]  opened in the event that they bring some bogus charge against me. You see, I have the name of
[03:28:30.280 --> 03:28:36.920]  Mr. Greenberg's handler and his phone number in the Miami FBI office. I assure you he would be called
[03:28:36.920 --> 03:28:43.960]  as a witness and we would ask for discovery from the FBI about the approach made to me by someone
[03:28:43.960 --> 03:28:51.640]  who is indiscutably an FBI informant. So, we shall see. I'm Roger Stone. It's the Alex Jones show.
[03:28:51.640 --> 03:28:57.320]  I'll be right back. Pain in my neck back and shoulders has really gotten worse. Relief for

[03:30:51.720 --> 03:30:58.440]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[03:30:58.440 --> 03:31:04.760]  law. If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that
[03:31:04.760 --> 03:31:10.360]  the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over. But if you look at everybody
[03:31:10.360 --> 03:31:14.920]  else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all
[03:31:14.920 --> 03:31:21.240]  beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted. There's only two groups in the US,
[03:31:21.240 --> 03:31:26.920]  InfoWars and Matt Drudge at drudgereport.com that are truly independent. And of course,
[03:31:26.920 --> 03:31:32.040]  they're two of the dominant media forces in the world. It really is amazing. That's why as we
[03:31:32.040 --> 03:31:36.760]  closed out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far
[03:31:36.760 --> 03:31:40.600]  we've come together. Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will
[03:31:41.720 --> 03:31:47.960]  of InfoWars. So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswars.com, christenpana.com,
[03:31:47.960 --> 03:31:51.960]  because if you don't spread the articles in the videos, no one else will. We're all in each
[03:31:51.960 --> 03:31:57.320]  other's hands. God bless you all and thank you. So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember,
[03:31:58.200 --> 03:32:03.080]  this life is a test. And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action,
[03:32:03.080 --> 03:32:07.720]  the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity coming back from the dead and
[03:32:07.720 --> 03:32:13.000]  recognizing it's being persecuted, that's all because you are the core, listening to InfoWars
[03:32:13.000 --> 03:32:19.960]  around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty that were immune or at least resistant to the
[03:32:19.960 --> 03:32:25.800]  globalist programming. Everybody knows who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians who
[03:32:25.800 --> 03:32:31.960]  tend to be immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it. And that's why they're
[03:32:31.960 --> 03:32:39.560]  trying to eradicate you. But regardless, this fight is intensifying. 2018 has been insane. 2019
[03:32:39.560 --> 03:32:44.760]  is going to be the big decision maker. And I am so honored to be here with you right beside me,
[03:32:45.480 --> 03:32:48.120]  not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything,
[03:32:48.120 --> 03:32:51.480]  resisting these globalists. So whatever you do, take action and realize,
[03:32:51.480 --> 03:33:19.480]  we're changing history together and I salute you.
[03:33:22.440 --> 03:33:27.960]  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I'm Roger Stone and you're at the right place. That's
[03:33:27.960 --> 03:33:34.680]  right. It's the Alex Jones show. I'm your pinch hitting host, Roger Stone. Now, we were talking
[03:33:34.680 --> 03:33:41.080]  earlier about the vote by the House Intelligence Committee to turn over transcripts of my four
[03:33:41.080 --> 03:33:47.400]  and a half hours of secret testimony before that committee. Of course, that information was
[03:33:47.400 --> 03:33:55.160]  illegally leaked to the Washington Post hours before the vote. And it came on the heels of the
[03:33:55.160 --> 03:34:02.600]  spate of stories we spoke about earlier smearing me, saying incorrectly that I admitted to lying
[03:34:02.600 --> 03:34:09.640]  about a billionaire Chinese fugitive in a news report here on InfoWars. Let me say it again in
[03:34:09.640 --> 03:34:15.640]  case you didn't hear it earlier. I have never reported or broadcast anything. I did not believe
[03:34:15.640 --> 03:34:23.800]  to be true at the time I broadcast it on InfoWars or any other platform. And when you consider the
[03:34:23.800 --> 03:34:29.640]  many hours and the hundreds of stories that we have reported, occasionally we make a mistake.
[03:34:29.640 --> 03:34:36.280]  And when we make a mistake, unlike the Washington Post, unlike the Daily Beast,
[03:34:36.280 --> 03:34:44.200]  unlike the Wall Street Journal, and so many other of the fake news media, we correct it.
[03:34:44.200 --> 03:34:50.840]  But those stories were the setup for the leak on Friday that the House Intelligence Committee
[03:34:50.840 --> 03:34:57.400]  had voted to release my testimony. Here's what you will sadly not read other than at ABC.
[03:34:58.040 --> 03:35:04.120]  I released a letter sent to the committee that very same day demanding that they release my
[03:35:04.120 --> 03:35:12.040]  testimony to the American people. Let's let the people see exactly what I said. So when
[03:35:12.040 --> 03:35:18.600]  Adam Schiff says, well, he didn't tell us about Henry Greenberg. He's right about that. On the
[03:35:18.600 --> 03:35:24.360]  end, on the other hand, my meeting with Henry Greenberg was inconsequential other than the fact
[03:35:24.360 --> 03:35:32.360]  that Mr. Greenberg, a Russian national, was an FBI informant. And he was in the country in 2016
[03:35:32.360 --> 03:35:39.800]  on the basis of an informants visa. Why is it that Congressman Schiff, the bull shiffer himself,
[03:35:39.800 --> 03:35:47.080]  has no interest whatsoever in who Henry Greenberg was and why he was trying to compromise me
[03:35:47.960 --> 03:35:57.000]  and attempting to sully the president, I should say, entrap the president in May of 2016? Then
[03:35:57.000 --> 03:36:03.960]  there's the question of an email exchange between Steve Bannon and I, an exchange that if you read
[03:36:03.960 --> 03:36:10.120]  The New York Times, you would believe I emailed Bannon. But in fact, Bannon emailed me. He did so
[03:36:10.120 --> 03:36:16.680]  on the heels of a public event widely reported in the press in which Julian Assange on October
[03:36:16.680 --> 03:36:26.600]  2 held a press event inside the embassy, of course, in London. And he released no documents
[03:36:26.600 --> 03:36:35.240]  regarding Hillary Clinton documents he had been teasing about on CNN on Fox since June of 2016.
[03:36:35.880 --> 03:36:42.600]  What most people did not notice is that Assange in that press event said that there would be
[03:36:42.600 --> 03:36:49.960]  weekly releases for the next 10 weeks, and that all of the US election related material would be
[03:36:49.960 --> 03:36:57.080]  released in the weeks before the election. That was reported by the Washington Post as, and I quote,
[03:36:57.080 --> 03:37:03.320]  Assange made some vague commitment to future disclosures, close quote. We have asked repeatedly
[03:37:03.320 --> 03:37:09.000]  for the Washington Post to correct that, and they have refused to do so. Who are the honest
[03:37:09.000 --> 03:37:15.640]  journalists and who is playing games with the truth? I think it's clear to the American people.
[03:37:15.640 --> 03:37:22.360]  So if the Mueller investigation or the House Intelligence Committee want to open the can of
[03:37:22.360 --> 03:37:30.280]  worms, we will find out when Crossfire Hurricane really began. We will find out when their preliminary
[03:37:30.280 --> 03:37:37.320]  investigation was opened. We will find out the circumstances under which Professor Joseph Mifsud
[03:37:37.320 --> 03:37:44.200]  approached George Papadopoulos. We will find out the circumstances under which Carter Page was
[03:37:44.200 --> 03:37:49.880]  approached by Stefan Halper. But more importantly, we will find out why the FBI was sending a known
[03:37:49.880 --> 03:37:57.320]  informant to see me in May of 2016 trying to sell me dirt on Hillary Clinton for $2 million.
[03:37:58.280 --> 03:38:03.320]  When I scoffed at that offer and rejected it, Mr. Greenberg said, and I quote,
[03:38:03.320 --> 03:38:10.920]  it's not your money I want, it's Donald Trump's money. I think that tells us everything we need
[03:38:10.920 --> 03:38:17.160]  to know. In the meantime, I think most of you are familiar with the tactic that the special
[03:38:17.160 --> 03:38:23.640]  counsel specializes in, and that is trying to financially destroy their victims. I have been
[03:38:23.640 --> 03:38:30.680]  under federal investigation for almost two years. I believe that few Americans could survive the
[03:38:30.680 --> 03:38:38.200]  proctological legal examination that I have been under. Yet today, I can tell you with all confidence
[03:38:38.200 --> 03:38:44.200]  that they have no evidence of Russian collusion, no evidence that I collaborated with WikiLeaks,
[03:38:44.200 --> 03:38:50.200]  no evidence that I communicated with Julian Assange or WikiLeaks beyond the two examples
[03:38:50.200 --> 03:38:56.760]  which are known. So on ABC two weekends ago, when Congressman Adam Schiff said, public reports
[03:38:56.760 --> 03:39:02.200]  indicate that the contacts with Stone and WikiLeaks were more extensive than he told the committee,
[03:39:02.200 --> 03:39:09.960]  no Congressman, that's a lie. I disclosed that Randy Kredico was my source to the House Intelligence
[03:39:09.960 --> 03:39:17.320]  Committee, and I released a innocuous direct message exchange between me and the flak at WikiLeaks
[03:39:17.320 --> 03:39:24.040]  in which he essentially blew me off, providing no evidence yet again of any collaboration.
[03:39:24.040 --> 03:39:29.480]  Only in this insane atmosphere can a direct message exchange, which is exculpatory,
[03:39:29.480 --> 03:39:35.080]  be held up as your tormentors in an aha moment. The problem is that those documents were turned
[03:39:35.080 --> 03:39:42.440]  over to the House Intelligence Committee well over a year ago. Oops. So that is the kind of
[03:39:42.440 --> 03:39:48.760]  witch hunt I have been subjected to. I think most of you know the goal is to destroy me financially,
[03:39:48.760 --> 03:39:54.200]  to so sap me of resources that I can no longer pay for the attorneys that I need to fight,
[03:39:54.200 --> 03:40:00.360]  which is why I asked you to go to the Stone Defense Fund now for a special holiday season
[03:40:00.360 --> 03:40:06.520]  emergency contribution. I am not exaggerating when I tell you that every penny I can scrape up
[03:40:06.520 --> 03:40:13.400]  has to go to pay my legal defense. They have unlimited taxpayer money with which to try to
[03:40:13.400 --> 03:40:19.080]  smear and destroy me. The woman heading the investigation into me used to be Hillary Clinton's
[03:40:19.080 --> 03:40:26.280]  attorney in the email case. Yes, you heard me right. And the supervising prosecutor was
[03:40:26.280 --> 03:40:31.640]  recommended for his job by none other than Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General. Wait
[03:40:31.640 --> 03:40:36.040]  a minute. I thought Mr. Mueller's inquiry was supposed to be completely independent
[03:40:36.040 --> 03:40:42.280]  of the Justice Department. There's a lot to get into here if they really want to proceed
[03:40:42.280 --> 03:40:47.560]  in this effort to take me down. But you can read again and again in the Atlantic,
[03:40:47.560 --> 03:40:54.520]  in the Washington Post, in the New York Times. I'm being investigated for my ties to WikiLeaks,
[03:40:54.520 --> 03:41:02.120]  which I've fully disclosed are minimal and innocuous. It's a witch hunt. Now some of you may
[03:41:02.120 --> 03:41:08.840]  have seen that I last week offered this little nugget. It's a paperweight. It's actually a
[03:41:08.840 --> 03:41:17.240]  Roger Stone, a stone which I have signed. And you can go to stonecoldtruth.com, click on shop,
[03:41:17.240 --> 03:41:24.040]  and buy one of these mementos for yourself. This is an exact replica of the very stone
[03:41:24.040 --> 03:41:30.840]  that little David used to take down Goliath. Now this was obviously a fundraising idea.
[03:41:30.840 --> 03:41:36.680]  Every dollar for a stone that I sell go to fund the Stone Legal Defense Fund.
[03:41:36.680 --> 03:41:45.080]  And frankly, sales were not too brisk until Talking Points Memo and Rolling Stone decided to mock me
[03:41:45.080 --> 03:41:53.080]  for the sale of these Roger Stones. That in turn means that they have flown off the shelf. I spent
[03:41:53.080 --> 03:42:01.240]  most of the Christmas holiday signing stones. I distributed gift stones, pardon me, to many of
[03:42:01.240 --> 03:42:07.960]  the Info Wars staff. But if you want to get your own stone today, a historical memento,
[03:42:07.960 --> 03:42:15.640]  go to stonecoldtruth.com, click on shop, and get your own Roger Stone. I will be happy to sign
[03:42:15.640 --> 03:42:22.120]  it and mail it to you immediately. Thank you. You're on the Alex Jones show. I'm Roger Stone.
[03:42:22.760 --> 03:42:27.800]  And it's a good time to remind you that we still need your support at infowars.com.

[03:44:17.480 --> 03:44:22.040]  You are the InfoWars. And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important
[03:44:22.040 --> 03:44:28.280]  than ever that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's
[03:44:28.280 --> 03:44:33.800]  no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel,
[03:44:33.800 --> 03:44:39.240]  you name it. And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the
[03:44:39.240 --> 03:44:43.400]  videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to, but the bare minimum you can
[03:44:43.400 --> 03:44:50.920]  do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter. We are the Renaissance
[03:44:50.920 --> 03:44:57.480]  and we are winning. The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's
[03:44:57.480 --> 03:45:03.800]  above the law. If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call
[03:45:03.800 --> 03:45:09.560]  the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over. But if you look at
[03:45:09.560 --> 03:45:13.960]  everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity,
[03:45:13.960 --> 03:45:20.040]  they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted. There's only two groups in
[03:45:20.040 --> 03:45:26.440]  the U.S. InfoWars and Matt Drudge of drudgereport.com that are truly independent. And of course,
[03:45:26.440 --> 03:45:31.560]  they're two of the dominant media forces in the world. It really is amazing. That's why as we
[03:45:31.560 --> 03:45:36.200]  close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far
[03:45:36.200 --> 03:45:40.040]  we've come together. Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will
[03:45:41.240 --> 03:45:47.880]  of InfoWars. So please spread the links infowars.com, newswars.com, christenplata.com, because if you
[03:45:47.880 --> 03:45:52.280]  don't spread the articles in the videos, no one else will. We're all in each other's hands. God
[03:45:52.280 --> 03:45:57.720]  bless you all and thank you. For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to
[03:45:57.720 --> 03:46:02.680]  take out the leadership. That's the globalist only hope. So when you support InfoWars, when you
[03:46:02.680 --> 03:46:07.080]  spread our articles and videos, when you buy products at infowars.com, you are literally not
[03:46:07.080 --> 03:46:11.320]  just supporting InfoWars in free speech and standing in defiance against Soros and Hillary
[03:46:11.320 --> 03:46:16.600]  and the rest of these people, but you are standing for your own future and your own best shot of
[03:46:16.600 --> 03:46:21.000]  having an early warning system in America to stand against these individuals. When you order
[03:46:21.000 --> 03:46:25.560]  products at infowars.com, you fund not just an American revolution, but a global revolution
[03:46:25.560 --> 03:46:29.960]  against charity. And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout to the end of the year
[03:46:29.960 --> 03:46:35.800]  as part of a total store clearance. Every order gets a free t-shirt. Every order gets free shipping.
[03:46:35.800 --> 03:46:41.400]  Every order gets 50 to 75 percent off in total clearance. And that funding allows us to go into
[03:46:41.400 --> 03:46:46.360]  the new year on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year to not
[03:46:46.360 --> 03:46:51.000]  just fight, but to expand. We're on the march. The empire is on the run. I salute you all. Now
[03:46:51.000 --> 03:47:00.120]  please take action at infowarsstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:00.120 --> 03:47:11.240]  Hello.
[03:47:13.240 --> 03:47:23.240]  Rumors spreadin' round. United takes his town. Right there's a guy outside the game.
[03:47:23.240 --> 03:47:29.000]  And you know what I'm talking about. Just let me know. Yeah, I still wanna go.
[03:47:31.160 --> 03:47:36.360]  To that home out on the range. I got a lot of nice girls.
[03:47:43.240 --> 03:47:49.480]  Welcome back. Yes, that's ZZ Top. That's an awful lot of music for just three guys. That's your
[03:47:49.480 --> 03:47:56.040]  genuine Texas guitar. Welcome back. You're on the Alex Jones show. I'm Roger Stone. You know,
[03:47:56.040 --> 03:48:03.720]  the most fun I had in all of the past year was when Alex Jones and I went into the lion's den
[03:48:03.720 --> 03:48:12.440]  and bearded down Sundar Pie, the chief executive officer of Google, a man who sat before the
[03:48:12.440 --> 03:48:20.600]  panel of the House Judiciary Committee and purged himself over and over again. Also notable was
[03:48:21.480 --> 03:48:27.000]  the performance of Congressman Jerry Nadler, who will soon claim to be the chairman of the House
[03:48:27.000 --> 03:48:33.960]  Judiciary Committee, and would be if we recognized the illicit and illegal recent elections in which
[03:48:33.960 --> 03:48:40.680]  voter fraud installed an alleged Democrat majority. Now, Nadler said in a statement,
[03:48:40.680 --> 03:48:46.520]  which was written by Google lobbyists and in a series of questions, which were written by
[03:48:46.520 --> 03:48:53.320]  Google lobbyists, that the idea that conservatives and Republicans and Trump supporters are
[03:48:53.320 --> 03:49:01.320]  disadvantaged in the Google search is a right-wing conspiracy theory. No Jerry, sorry. You may
[03:49:01.320 --> 03:49:07.640]  simply look at the internal videos from Google, the internal memos that have leaked, and the
[03:49:07.640 --> 03:49:14.680]  extraordinary good work of Project Veritas to prove that you are a bald-faced liar, and that
[03:49:14.680 --> 03:49:23.080]  conservatives are indeed disadvantaged. Case in point, when Congressman Joaquin Castro, the adorable
[03:49:23.080 --> 03:49:32.360]  twin congressman from Texas, IQ 70, accused me a week ago of perjury for the House Intelligence
[03:49:32.360 --> 03:49:40.920]  Committee because he claimed that I said that I didn't know the timing of the WikiLeaks disclosures
[03:49:40.920 --> 03:49:47.640]  when what I said was I didn't know the exact timing of my contact, my source, having told me
[03:49:47.640 --> 03:49:54.760]  that it would be in October. Now, I know this is tough for you, Joaquin, but October has 31 days,
[03:49:54.760 --> 03:50:01.160]  and we didn't know what day it would be. Consequently, my testimony was truthful and
[03:50:01.160 --> 03:50:07.960]  honest, and your claim is a smear. But if you go look that story up, you'll find that all the
[03:50:07.960 --> 03:50:15.320]  stories in which he makes the charge against me are at the top of the feed, but then the story
[03:50:15.320 --> 03:50:22.040]  in the media, in the Daily Caller and Info Wars, where I destroy his arguments, well, you won't
[03:50:22.040 --> 03:50:28.680]  find that perfect example of the kind of games that Google is playing. Then they asked him about
[03:50:28.680 --> 03:50:34.280]  China. China, he said, I couldn't find the place on a map. We're not working in China. We're not
[03:50:34.280 --> 03:50:41.400]  doing anything with the Chinese government. A lie. Then we talked about the whole question of the
[03:50:41.400 --> 03:50:47.880]  tracking capability of the Google program on your cell phone. Oh, no, he said, that can be turned
[03:50:47.880 --> 03:50:53.560]  off. Well, yes, it can be turned off. That means you don't have the function showing, but the tracking
[03:50:53.560 --> 03:51:00.200]  continues. This guy is the biggest liar since, oh, I don't know, Congressman Adam Schiff. You
[03:51:00.200 --> 03:51:06.920]  remember him? He's the guy who said he's seen more than circumstantial evidence of Russian collusion
[03:51:06.920 --> 03:51:11.880]  as a member of the House Intelligence Committee. Told that to Chuck Todd on Meet the Press,
[03:51:11.880 --> 03:51:20.360]  but has never been able to produce an iota, a centella. That's because it is a fraud. It's
[03:51:20.360 --> 03:51:28.440]  Bull Schiff. You're listening on radio. I said, Schiff, S-C-H-I-F-F, which reminds me of the
[03:51:28.440 --> 03:51:36.040]  slogan, if it's Schiff, flush it. That's Schiff, S-C-H-I-F-F. This guy is the greatest con man,
[03:51:36.040 --> 03:51:41.880]  the greatest huckster, the greatest charlatan that I have seen. They called him tricky dick,
[03:51:41.880 --> 03:51:48.120]  but next to Richard Nixon, Nixon looks like St. Thomas Aquinas compared to Adam Schiff,
[03:51:48.120 --> 03:51:54.040]  a fraudster. It's a shame that I am unlikely to go testify for his committee because a lot of
[03:51:54.040 --> 03:52:00.040]  questions I'd like to ask him. Why is he having a fundraiser hosted by a Ukrainian arms dealer
[03:52:00.040 --> 03:52:07.000]  with undeniable links to organized crime in Ukraine? What exactly is his relationship with
[03:52:07.000 --> 03:52:16.200]  Ed Buck, the gay, democratic fundraiser and mega donor who seems to have been responsible
[03:52:16.200 --> 03:52:23.240]  for the deaths of a number of young black male prostitutes? This was wildly reported in the
[03:52:23.240 --> 03:52:30.040]  media, yet there has been a cover-up and one of his victim's mothers has called out repeatedly for
[03:52:30.040 --> 03:52:36.120]  justice. Yes, I would say Adam Schiff has a lot of questions to answer. Unfortunately, I probably
[03:52:36.120 --> 03:52:40.920]  won't get the opportunity to ask them, but I'm sure the mainstream media will ask him these
[03:52:40.920 --> 03:52:49.720]  hard questions. Oh, probably not. In any event, it is going to be an extraordinary year because it
[03:52:49.720 --> 03:52:55.640]  is obvious to me that the House Democrats intend to vote articles of impeachment against President
[03:52:55.640 --> 03:53:02.440]  Donald Trump. You can see them crashing the economy now as the backdrop for impeachment,
[03:53:02.440 --> 03:53:08.520]  as Rush Limbaugh pointed out only the other day in his terrific broadcast. That is their intention.
[03:53:08.520 --> 03:53:15.320]  They did it under Nixon in 1974. They seek to do it now. No, it is not Donald Trump destroying the
[03:53:15.320 --> 03:53:22.360]  economy. It is a Fed chairman who is now raising interest rates yet again because he says the
[03:53:22.360 --> 03:53:29.320]  economy may overheat. I see no evidence of this overheating. What I see is prosperity and the
[03:53:29.320 --> 03:53:38.760]  fact that there are jobs again, that President Donald Trump has created 4.2 million jobs,
[03:53:39.640 --> 03:53:44.600]  that unemployment is at the lowest point in American history, that Hispanic and Black
[03:53:44.600 --> 03:53:50.280]  unemployment are at the lowest point since we've been keeping those statistics, that billions of
[03:53:50.280 --> 03:53:56.280]  dollars were pouring back into the country for reinvestment. My God, Trump has revived the
[03:53:56.280 --> 03:54:02.680]  economy. Now, they, the international bankers working with the Fed, an illicit group whose
[03:54:02.680 --> 03:54:08.120]  responsibilities and duties and authority are not outlined in our U.S. Constitution,
[03:54:08.120 --> 03:54:15.000]  are seeking destroy economic prosperity as the backdrop to take down our president.
[03:54:15.000 --> 03:54:22.040]  Make no mistake about that, folks. That is the game plan. Now, since Mr. Mueller will come up
[03:54:22.040 --> 03:54:27.400]  empty-handed on the question of Russian collusion, it's pretty clear that the Democrats decided they
[03:54:27.400 --> 03:54:34.520]  were going to use a tortured and questionable campaign finance reform allegation against the
[03:54:34.520 --> 03:54:41.640]  president as the basis of impeachment. Adam Schiff, who we referred to previously, actually said,
[03:54:41.640 --> 03:54:47.160]  Donald Trump will face jail time. Well, you know what, congressmen? The guy who should face jail
[03:54:47.160 --> 03:54:52.840]  time is the guy who took international campaign contributions from the Ukraine, if we know anybody
[03:54:52.840 --> 03:54:59.640]  who meets that definition. And while we're at it, we probably need to disclose the names of all
[03:54:59.640 --> 03:55:06.920]  those members of Congress who use taxpayer money to pay off claims of sexual harassment. That would
[03:55:06.920 --> 03:55:12.680]  be a story that would be most interesting. And I'm willing to bet you that there are more Democrats
[03:55:12.680 --> 03:55:18.200]  on that list than Republicans. In fact, I'm willing to bet you that most of the people on that list,
[03:55:18.200 --> 03:55:25.160]  perhaps virtually all of them, will be Democrats. Democrats whose names are in the news every day,
[03:55:25.160 --> 03:55:32.360]  Democrats who are members of the House Intelligence Committee, soon to be in their alleged majority.
[03:55:32.360 --> 03:55:38.440]  I suspect that people who live in glass houses should not throw stones. Mr. Schiff says he's
[03:55:38.440 --> 03:55:44.840]  sponsoring legislation to change a ruling by the Justice Department that says a sitting president
[03:55:44.840 --> 03:55:50.840]  cannot be prosecuted. Good. Why don't we also post legislation to say that members of Congress
[03:55:50.840 --> 03:55:57.000]  who use taxpayer money to pay off claims of sexual assault or sexual harassment are immediately
[03:55:57.000 --> 03:56:03.400]  ejected from the Congress. Now, that's legislation that I could really get behind.
[03:56:03.400 --> 03:56:08.680]  The hypocrisy of the left is incredible. Robert Mueller and Adam Schiff are pursuing
[03:56:08.680 --> 03:56:15.160]  Roger Stone on allegations of perjury. Yet James Clapper can testify to the Congress
[03:56:15.720 --> 03:56:21.960]  that we have no metadata collection program on Americans proven to be a lie by the revelations
[03:56:21.960 --> 03:56:29.480]  published by Glenn Greenwald in the Intercept that came from Edward Snowden. So there is
[03:56:29.480 --> 03:56:35.400]  one standard for Republicans and conservatives and Trump supporters. There's a completely
[03:56:35.400 --> 03:56:42.520]  different standard for Democrats. That's where we have come in America today. If you want us to
[03:56:42.520 --> 03:56:48.520]  continue this crusading investigative journalist, if you want us to continue to call out George Soros

[03:57:59.160 --> 03:58:03.720]  else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all
[03:58:03.720 --> 03:58:10.840]  beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted. There's only two groups in the U.S. Infowars
